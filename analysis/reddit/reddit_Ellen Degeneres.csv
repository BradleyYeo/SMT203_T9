In comparison, if I gave this guy 40 minutes of my earnings, I would be giving him less than 4 bucks. I generally give more than that to charity and other good causes weekly.

So what I'm saying is that I am more generous than Ellen because I give a far greater percentage of my wealth. 

Now I feel like a saint, and you should too if you give any money to the less fortunate. Remember, you give more than Ellen!

That quarter alone is like 1/5th of my college debt and I've been in school for 7 years. Why do people go to such expensive schools? To say they went? I'm quickly discovering nobody really gives a shit what school you attend, they care more about what you did while attending and what you know once you're out."

I'm still riding high on my smugness that I am actually a more generous person by percentage of earnings than Ellen!

From the article:

Dress code:

>A dress code is a set of rules, often written, with regards to clothing.

If we want to get really pedantic, as I am currently being, then yes a hair cut is not clothing. However, this situation meets the definition of 'compulsory'.

Personally, I don't care in the slightest whether or not he has deadlocks. I also find it offensive that the school wouldn't let him walk over something so trivial in the grand scheme of things. 

That said, we absolutely need rules to protect those who cannot protect themselves as well as establish cultural norms and mores. Saying that we shouldn't tell others what to do is overly generalizing and shortsighted."

Its demeaning and embarrassing, and Ellen is the biggest offender of them all. 

So this kid got $20K for succumbing to the pressure and cutting his hair, which will grow back. Hair does that.

College could switch it up but instead they peddle all kinds of propaganda along with the fan base believing that it‚Äôs the only way. It‚Äôs a billion dollar a year slave factory under a socialist scheme. It needs to be fixed.

you know what? i‚Äôm curious so i‚Äôll look for you. 

26000 students enrolled at southern. 

quick google says in-state tuition in 2017 was 6700/yr. so more now, but not bad. 

UGA looks like $11,000, so quite a bit more. 

currently with HOPE, if you maintain a 3.0, they pay up to $7680/ year.

so my sister who went to UGA ended up paying at most around 16k tuition for 4 years. 

while we were all responsible to make prudent college selection choices based on money, we are  very lucky to have hope scholarship and parents that could help with the extra.

Furthermore, athletics are just one part of college marketing.

436,2020-01-31 13:04:12,ewgl3q,"You really need to learn how money in correlation with compound Interest works. It's easy to stay rich, but it's hard to get rich."
437,2020-01-31 13:31:32,ewgl3q,"I agree that exponential wealth is out of control. There needs to be a cap where taxes take the rest and redistribute the wealth via health, education and other social and municipal services. 


Problem, every country would have to do this otherwise the elite will move to counties who don‚Äôt. Thus possibly hurting the economy because major corporations move as well. 


It‚Äôs a hard game they play. Elites control every aspect of our society using money as power and they do not want to loos that power.


Now, all that being said, there are plenty of famously rich people, like Ellen, who make $75 million a year and have a net worth of $450 million and give lots of money away. Some way more than others. Bill and Melinda Gates had to start a foundation just to give more away as it takes a lot of work to do so. 
Many famous or newly rich people have been advocating to pay more taxes and giving half their wealth to charities or the people."
438,2020-01-31 16:56:07,ewgl3q,"I misspoke with alienate - replace it with ‚Äúignore‚Äù and my point is exactly the same. See the Google metaphor.

Regarding your scholarship point...scholarships are given for both academic ability *as well as* athletics. And like I said, athletics brings in millions more than it spends, which goes back into the school. It‚Äôs a no-brainer financial decision. I fail to see what‚Äôs fundamentally wrong with those scholarships, can you elaborate?"
439,2020-01-31 17:18:07,ewgl3q,"They still get a college education, and most of those athletes don‚Äôt go pro. A lot of those athletes are smart as hell too and work hard to be a college athlete while keeping up with their grades"
440,2020-01-31 17:52:41,ewgl3q,"Athletic scholarships are given to athletes. Students with excellent academic success receive academic scholarships, least in Division 1. They‚Äôre two separate types of scholarship."
441,2020-02-01 17:14:55,ewgl3q,Those athletes bring in donations. Sports makes money for universities so they can fund gay penguin research.
442,2020-01-31 21:52:17,ewgl3q,I‚Äôm not sure what you mean here. Are you saying that a school bringing in $20 million in profit from their football program is not investing any of that back into the school?
443,2020-01-31 16:46:39,ewgl3q,"Schools pay for coaches through boosters, which they raise money. The school doesn‚Äôt directly pay it. Do some more research."
444,2020-01-31 17:06:45,ewgl3q,"No, I didn‚Äôt say that. I said I oppose socialism as a form of government. I believe that massive changes to our healthcare system need to be made. I don‚Äôt think Bernie is the right idea, however. I like Andrew yang and his tax policies. I think that a single payer system for healthcare sounds great. I would like to see the entire plan up front. Obamacare was great until it was rewritten at the last minute by special interest groups. 

I encourage you to seek some balance in your ideologies vs practicality. Nothing is ever black and white unless you force it to be. And when you force it to be black and white you draw a line in the sand and force people around you to pick a side. That‚Äôs not conducive to winning friends and influencing people. Have a good day and enjoy your weekend."
445,2020-02-01 04:17:41,ewgl3q,"Lol. Do you even know how much $20,000 is? Shit, she may as well just give her entire net worth. 

I get that she‚Äôs loaded, but it‚Äôs insane that this extremely generous donation for no reason at all isn‚Äôt good enough."
446,2020-01-31 13:21:39,ewgl3q,"100% the case. 

Give me a million, I‚Äôll never work again and still gain $$."
447,2020-01-31 14:49:14,ewgl3q,That‚Äôs not the point at all. If the compound interest is adding to their extreme wealth than they are clearly not giving away very much of it to charity. If they were truly so giving their massive bank accounts would be shrinking not growing. Many billionaires use charitable ‚Äúgiving‚Äù to avoid taxes even. The call it charity but the money never actually goes anywhere. These funds can hold charitable donations for indefinite amount of time. Maybe I‚Äôm not the one who needs to learn something  [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/03/business/donor-advised-funds-tech-tax.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/03/business/donor-advised-funds-tech-tax.html)

450,2020-01-31 17:08:45,ewgl3q,"Sounds like we don‚Äôt disagree on that much, but socialism isn‚Äôt a form of government, it‚Äôs an economic system."
451,2020-01-31 14:51:36,ewgl3q,Still very much missing the point.
452,2020-01-31 15:17:48,ewgl3q,"I know that some people use charities to evade income tax, but this is not the point of this video. 
People are saying that 20k is too little compared to what Ellen is worth. 
What u are saying about compound interest is so mind numbingly stupid. Most billionaires don't have all their money in cash, they are tied to investments so money can work. You can't just take that money out of the investment to donate it. 
There is a charity called the giving pledge which bill gates made where all the billionaires that signed up give away 50% or more of their net worth after they pass."
453,2020-01-31 15:10:18,ewgl3q,I never said Bill Gates cut his wealth in half. I said many rich people have been calling for taxes to do so.
454,2020-01-31 15:36:03,ewgl3q,Never ceases to amaze how many ‚Äúpeasants‚Äù get on their knees for billionaires. No one said anything about all their money. What‚Äôs ‚Äúmind numbingly stupid‚Äù is making big claims without bothering to back it up with links. Show me I‚Äôm wrong and I‚Äôll change my mind. That‚Äôs more than most people here can say.  https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/the-gift-adviser/2015/6/9/with-the-giving-pledge-the-devil-is-in-the-details.html
455,2020-01-31 15:10:39,ewgl3q,And I said links. You actually did say they are giving away half to charities and people it‚Äôs in that last sentence.
456,2020-01-31 15:41:02,ewgl3q,"Dude it just says that you need to pay fucking taxes on what u give away. Who gives a shit that 1 billion net worth is 300 million given away. It's a good deed regardless if u are obligated or not. I hardly doubt that gates and buffet won't fulfill their obligations of the giving pledge, since gates in particular has done a lot in terms of donating 
Why are u bickering about those little things"
457,2020-01-31 15:28:24,ewgl3q,I said many rich people have been ADVOCATING to pay more taxes and or giving half their money away.
458,2020-01-31 16:01:00,ewgl3q,Make no mistake there is a class war happening and people thinking like you are why we have been losing for half a century. It‚Äôs not your fault. Their endless wealth has funded the propaganda you and the like minded spew.
459,2020-01-31 15:39:13,ewgl3q,Cute little edit there with the ‚Äúand or‚Äù. Advocating means nothing. They certainly don‚Äôt need laws to give half their money away. Empty promises just like your empty argument.
460,2020-01-31 16:11:08,ewgl3q,"Why are u assuming my financial situation? I live a very comfortable life and am very happy with my financial situation.
If u are unhappy with your finances, maybe you shouldn't argue on reddit with randoms and instead do something meaningful LOL"
461,2020-01-31 23:49:56,ewgl3q,"I didn‚Äôt edit. I paraphrased myself. Read back at the original comment.

Also, I said originally that I think exponential wealth is out of control. There needs to be a cap where taxes take the rest and redistribute the wealth via health, education and other social and municipal services. 

I‚Äôm am in no way on the side of the elite. Please take your anger elsewhere."
462,2020-01-31 16:21:51,ewgl3q,My bad I didn‚Äôt realize you‚Äôre net worth was in the hundreds of millions. No? I thought so. This is the exact kind of reaction they pay for you to have. Whatever your making is crumbs in comparison. Say your a millionaire. You know the difference between a million dollars and a billion is the same as $1 is to $1000. the difference between 10 million dollars and 10 billion is essentially 10 billion dollars. Excessive unchecked wealth is a cancer on society. And will inevitably lead to an economic crash. And while we are hurt by this scrounging for food they will be renovating their boathouses.
463,2020-02-01 03:06:39,ewgl3q,If I got angry every time someone had another opinion I‚Äôd drive myself crazy. You‚Äôre mistaking frustration with passion.
464,2020-02-01 12:01:40,ewgl3q,"Well that‚Äôs good that you‚Äôre not angry.
But perhaps your should chat with people in a less defensive and insulting way as you come across angry and bitter.

Like I said from the beginning, I too agree that the elite need to have wealth caps and need to be taxed considerably more. I‚Äôm on your side. 

But also like I said, it‚Äôs not that simple. We need every country in the world do do it too otherwise the elite will move themselves and their companies to countries that allow them to continue essentially destroying the economy in countries where they currently reside."
465,2020-02-01 12:35:28,ewgl3q,"This is inaccurate because fleeing will not get them out of paying taxes. 
According to US law any US citizen has to pay federal income taxes regardless of where they live or where they make their money. 
The US is the only country that does this and it can lead to double taxation. However you can generally exempt income you already paid taxes on. 
In theory you can renouncer US citizenship and some people have done this. But the US makes it very difficult And they generally won‚Äôt except your renunciation until all of your tax bills are squared away. So you see even if they flee The country they can‚Äôt really fully flee taxation."
466,2020-02-01 13:27:27,ewgl3q,"Yes, this is true and it applies to everyone in the United States. However, the elites can afford to pay for their next citizenship to another country. When you are that elite, the abilities are nearly boundless. Less face it, your average middle class citizen probably pays more in taxes than the rich elite. They know loopholes to save away, invest or write off a good portion of what they are taxed, currently. But, if it changes, they will just pick up and leave to the next place that allows them their freedom to horde vast amounts of money. They can denounce the country buy their way to another and I‚Äôm sure if they wanted could buy their way back to their original country if they wanted in the future, that is just how rich they are. 
I‚Äôm not saying I like this, but it‚Äôs the truth."

I would be shocked if Amazon is not announcing something new on 2-2.  What that something is is the question.

Now, if there is something new related to Alexa, where else can a product like this go other than to add an interactive display.

Someone else pointed out that the countertops in that kitchen in the commercial just happen to be white white, even though that is not the top trending color these days.

Here's another clue.  Note how the lighting is not very bright in that kitchen.  That's a bit unusual.  That lighting is perfect for making the MVIS projector look good (I wish they would crank up the laser power btw so this issue goes away...)."
495,2020-01-29 18:12:41,evpuvn,"We can‚Äôt be 100% sure that those spots are everything. 
Why did they leave out the kitchen, wine scene in this collection?
And logically, IF indeed it was the world‚Äôs first interactive laser display debut... would they allow a corporate design secret to get previewed on Ellentube during trading hours?  

I‚Äôd think it would involve too many corporate NDA legal loopholes to allow that. So maybe this collection is just the already known Amazon device categories."
496,2020-01-29 19:23:34,evpuvn,"IF PM can be believed and Im willing to believe he can, then I'm 99.99% sure we got a deal with Amazon coming, regardless of whether ads this weekend show ID or not."
497,2020-01-30 00:05:01,evpuvn,"That seems like a setup commercial.  One of two I would assume.  In marketing you need to point out how things were, how they are now and then show them how it will be in the future.

These devices to be successful need people to change their behavior and think differently.   Sometimes you need to nudge them in the right direction which I believe they will do in a follow on commercial likely to be aired same day.  We'll see."

Yes."
506,2020-01-29 19:37:18,evpuvn,Agreed.  I doubt that Amazon would shoot their SB wad on just 1 commercial.  It's almost as if this commercial is preparatory for 1 or 3 more commercials? I guess we're about to find out.
507,2020-01-29 19:39:47,evpuvn,"Mck, and also why would you post an ad you paid $$$millions to make and place in the SB? You wouldn't, at least not the real juicy stuff to reveal during primetime rather than a weekday on youtube.   JMO    ;-)

515,2020-01-29 18:24:08,evpuvn,"Yep... think positive. Maybe there‚Äôs a series of about 4 ID projection videos yet to come - including one where Ellen asks her friend ‚ÄúHave you seen that new Amazon movie yet?‚Äù And of course this is the intro to flip up the projection head to display on the side of the fridge or something.

And another scene where Ellen is in the middle of the wine mess or a cooking mess - and ID saves the day.

We KNOW these things exist and are ready to launch... so maybe this could be it. Now I see that Ellen Degeneris will probably be in every commercial break in one device or another... maybe the MVIS display will be right before halftime."
516,2020-01-30 15:16:22,evpuvn,"Echo with earbuds. Hmmmm . . .  and Ellen said ""I stay awake at night thinking about this.""  So, perhaps the ability to listen to Amazon music via voice ordering?  Maybe 'books on tape' ?"

518,2020-01-29 20:01:28,evpuvn,"That would certainly makes sense.  But now I am starting to think this is such a clear tee-up for introducing the next generation device without anyone expecting it.  The release of a pleasant but commercially useless message about Alexa's history; the teasing of the spilled wine, the history of the book, the gentleman in the pillory about to get his hands useful again.

Is it possible that Amazon has managed to hide a major manufacturing effort?  Could they have contracted through STM at least for the initial load with just a royalty going to MVIS just for the secrecy effect?  MVIS would not have to announce it and ultimately they include MVIS devices that do get announced, after the big reveal?

&#x200B;

I think that probably the biggest unknown in the whole theory as it stands is the connection between young blood and adrenochrome. Lots of speculation and theories, but no real science or facts. The facts as I can figure them out are:

1. Blood from young sources is desired by some of the elite (most famously Peter Thiel) because they think it promotes health benefits (youth? vigor? regeneration?) I have not seen any actual science to prove any benefits, but it is clear that some people believe in it enough to infuse themselves with the blood of the young.
2. Child trafficking rings are a much bigger problem than the public is aware of and a possible source of black market young blood. 
3. Adrenochrome is real and used as a drug and can cause psychosis, schizophrenia, etc. Adrenochrome knowledge is not widely disseminated, if not actually suppressed.

I am not sure if it has been 100% confirmed that adrenochrome is produced in human blood, but that is the connecting point between young blood and adrenochrome. I think there is a very clear connection between the desire for young blood and child trafficking as a source of young blood. I think the celeb videos are fascinating, and could show that they are in some sort of drug withdrawal. However, it is also a strong possibility that they are simply addicted to attention and don't have anyone giving them scripts so they are putting on ""quarantine face"" and doing ad lib acts that come off as weird because they aren't writers. In any case, I am following the adrenochrome stuff closely. Lots of speculation, little conclusive fact. Its all materializing though."

Ok...1 celeb (Mark Baum) so far and, i believe I read so far 60+ priests (close to 8000 though have been arrested on the last week or so) Fun fact: Madonna gave an R.I.P tweet to Mark Baum. Apparently they were good friends.

Side not: The theory stated above is mine. You bring up a good point concerning how little evidence there is Adrenochrome is produced in the blood of the young when they are terrorized, outside of ""fringe/conspiracy websites. However if you google ""The Adrenochrome Pathway"" you will find links to several scientific publications that show the body does in fact produce Adrenochrome naturally. They use arthritis patients to expain it)  Anyways, I ask you to consider these points.

1.) How many ""reputable"" mainstream scientific and medical publications are owned somehow by the the people who are being accused of all this (alot)

2.) The ones that would publish findings related to this topic (that children produce adrenochrome naturally when experiencing extreme pain and terror)  be difficult to find because they have been censored into oblivion (Its been proven Google, You Tube, and other major platforms HEAVILY censor content)

3.) It is plausible that in mainstream sources of information in the scientific and medical field avoid this particular part. If you research adrenochrome you find alot of information on its chemical makeup and what it is (adrenialine/epinephrine that has been oxidized wether naturally or synthetically) but little to none on WHEN the body does this outside of examples involving Arthritis (and arthritis causes the body pain)

3.)Anyone studying this would then have to admit how they came to their conclusions (in other words would have to admit they tortured kids to learn this) which I am sure is in violation of God knows how many rules/laws.

4.) Every single one of the people who stepped forward/came clean/blew the whistle regarding this subject, wether willing or unwilling participant have all had the same answer when asked why these people do this. That drinking the blood of a child who was terrorized and subsequently murdered, gets you high and that the cult members believed it gave them power and long life. All the way back to ancient Egypt, The Mayans, and others they believed this. 
    I just cannot believe that ALL those people who never met each other were lying or mistaken.
   How does the saying go? Once is an event, Twice a coincidence, three times is a pattern.

Again, unless its openly and ""officially"" admitted, we wont ever truly know because we do not engage in such practices. We DO know though that AdrenoChrome is classified as a Psychoactive/hallucinogenic substance officially. We DO know that the body can oxidize adrenaline naturally under certain conditions (and the only conditions I personally have found involve the body experiencing pain) unfortunately for us curious types we have to rely on rumor/conspiracy related sources and statements from whistleblowers/victims/ex cult members to piece the rest together so everything I have written above is just THEORY. 

Personally, I doubt there will ever be disclosure on this subject because the information would result in certain sick people who like to get high wanting to try it out. If people will use crocadil (the flesh eating heroin like drug) knowing what it does, then why not adrenochrome. Sorry the post was so long."

Some time ago (maybe a couple years) I watched  a documentary about North-Korea, its previous ruler (Kim Jong-Un's father), and the results of western economic sanctions against North-Korea, resulting in famine. Kim Jong-Il was shown apparently dining on expensive imported food, and right after there was a scene of supposedly victims of the famine - an underlit scene with several hard to distinguish people sitting on beds or on the ground; for about 1 second the camera was showing a little girl (somewhere between 6-10 years old maybe) with stark terror in her face, looking straight into the camera. To me it was clear this had nothing to do with starvation, and this small piece of footage must have been included in the documentary by mistake. It was real, intense terror, not hunger speaking from her face. It is hard to forget."
537,2020-03-27 21:32:44,fq0it8,"   After reading that article you posted, something occurred to me. In the first paragraph it explains that 60 years ago they discovered adrenochrome after exposing concentrated solutions of adrenaline to the air (paraphrased) the color of the resulting solution is pink I guess. This simple process is what oxidation is.
   I copied what google responded when I asked if the body produces adrenaline when it is in pain and, this is the answer pasted below:

  adrenaline¬†rush is one of the¬†body's¬†vital defense mechanisms. A stressful situation¬†will¬†trigger the¬†release¬†of the hormone¬†adrenaline, also known as¬†epinephrine, into the bloodstream. The¬†production¬†of¬†adrenaline¬†occurs in the adrenal glands, which sit above the kidneys. ... decreasing the¬†body's¬†ability to feel¬†pain .Jul 17

So, if pain and stress causes the adrenal gland to produce adrenaline and flood the blood stream with it and, adrenochrome is the product of exposing adrenaline to the air. It makes sense (in theory) that they would torture to create a stressful situation so that the blood contains adrenaline, then its as simple as just exposing the blood to air while the adrenaline rush is still occuring (height of terror and stress) through sacrifice or what the hell ever (honestly its probably less sacrifice and more a way to do away with someone who can later accuse them of all this).
  Since people like Madonna or whoever, are not scientists, and I would ASSUME do not have the knowledge, equipment, and means to separate the adrenochrome from the blood (although, who the hell knows) they would simply drink the blood to achieve the desired effect. 
Also from what I have found it seems much cheaper to buy a child than it is to buy Adrenochrome.....
  Again. Just speculation."
538,2020-03-27 20:53:42,fq0it8,"  Rad,  hopefully you will be able to cut through all the technical jargon and arrive to the point of it all because , I barely was able to lol. Im an artist by trade not a scientist and, while I would like to think I am an intelligent person, I struggle with alot of scientific and medical publications. I know there isnt alot of information regarding Adrenochrome that is laid out for someone like myself to understand clearly (which is a little eyebrow raising) 
  If you find anymore information regarding this subject please share it. Looking forward to reading your conclusions."
539,2020-03-27 22:00:42,fq0it8,"Another good source: https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/bitstream/10316/10377/1/Oxidation%20Process%20of%20Adrenaline%20in%20Freshly%20Isolated%20Rat.pdf

It seems that adrenaline can be oxidized both inside and outside the body. From my research it seems like it is unstable and degrades in about 4 minutes outside the body, but can persist longer inside the body. Things like distress, exercise, and heart stress can cause adrenochrome to be oxidize in the heart and be distributed by blood to other parts of the body. So there is perhaps different ways that they use their victims to access it, and what you described sounds plausible.

I am fully convinced of the link between adrenochrome and the blood. I also think there is more going on here. I think the adrenochrome high is just one potential reason why they would abuse children. For example, from what Ive looked at today I have seen no clear health benefits of adrenochrome, just that it gives you a high similar to hallucinogens."
540,2020-03-27 22:15:33,fq0it8,"From my researching it looks like a lot of the research ahs focused on the chemistry of adrenochrome and its negative affects on humans. I was trying to dig up positive effects that might link its consumption to long life or youthfulness, but I couldn't find any. Some interesting things I found were confirmations of adrenochrome forming when adrenaline is exposed to air, saliva oxidizing adrenaline, but most interesting is the adrenochrome theory of schizophrenia. An old theory of schizophrenia held that it was due to high concentrations of adrenochrome in the brain. I don't think this is the accepted reason for schizophrenia, but it was probably on the mind of scientists working on projects like MK Ultra.

545,2020-03-28 14:05:13,fq0it8,"Thanks for this link, it really opened up a can of worms. I have been down the rabbit hole for hours now. I found three potential benefits from taking adrenochrome:  

\- **It can stop blood flow or it induces ""hemostasis"".** This one isn't really all that interesting to me, its only application would be in stopping wounds from bleeding.

\- **It can excite the sympathetic (involuntary) nervous system.** This comes from the frog and rabbit ear studies. Basically what they found is that adrenaline + adrenochrome could cause nerves to respond to stimuli. I don't think this was really a proof of re-animation as Shad Olson seemed to think. However, it is still interesting and relevant. Adrenaline is a hormone naturally produced in our body and adrenochrome is a natural byproduct its oxidation. If they are both important to keep our sympathetic nervous system working, then you would expect to see decreased function of the sympathetic nervous system with age because we lose ability to produce hormones with age. So if an elderly person were to take adrenochrome and adrenaline it might keep their sympathetic nervous system working better longer than it naturally should. You can read about the sympathetic nervous system on wikipedia, but essentially it is responsible for the function of everything we don't think about like eye dilation, heart and other vital organ function, etc. Its pretty important.

You can find the actual rabbit ear paper here: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392325/pdf/jphysiol01475-0014.pdf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392325/pdf/jphysiol01475-0014.pdf)

The frog study is referenced in the rabbit ear paper, and it was very difficult to find. I believe it is this paper: [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/13813453309146171?journalCode=iarp17](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/13813453309146171?journalCode=iarp17) However, as you can see, it is in french and behind a paywall.

Wikipedia article on sympathetic nervous system: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic\_nervous\_system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system)

This was all interesting, but I think there is one more benefit from adrenochrome that is the biggest bombshell I found.

**- Adrenochrome slows mitosis (cell division)** This one is BIG. My main source on this information is here: [https://archive.org/details/AbramHofferHumphryOsmondTheHallucinogens/page/n373/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/AbramHofferHumphryOsmondTheHallucinogens/page/n373/mode/2up) This book is a wealth of information. I only advise diving in if you have a lot of time on your hands. Basically it has a big summary of all the early adrenochrome research. It even has first hand accounts of scientists who were the first to really try it on themselves, which was fascinating. Several pages here are dedicated to discussing adrenochromes ""anti-mitotic"" effects. You can read about mitosis on wikipedia, but basically it is how our cells divide and our body grows. Think of your hair or nails growing, it is because new cells are being produced all the time. Most of the cells in our body are in some state of mitosis, always replicating. This is one of the reasons we age, because constant replication leads to deteriation of our cells and by extension our bodies. If you could slow down mitosis it would effectively slow down aging. This is the fountain of youth stuff right here. The author of the book even did later research pushing adrenochrome as a cure for cancer: [http://orthomolecular.org/library/jom/1996/pdf/1996-v11n03-p147.pdf](http://orthomolecular.org/library/jom/1996/pdf/1996-v11n03-p147.pdf)

My conclusion from all this is that taking adrenochrome could potentially keep your nervous system running past its normal expiration date and slow down aging (not stop or reverse, only slow down). If this is true then this is a major incentive to take it. It should also be noted that a lot of this research is dedicated to the ""adrenochrome theory of schizophrenia"" and they seem to be pretty convinced that prolonged exposure to high levels of adrenochrome can cause permanent psychosis."
546,2020-03-28 14:51:38,fq0it8,"   That would certainly explain the behavior of ALOT of well known politicians and celebs.
   The conclusion I came too was basically the same as far as it not being a literal fountain of youth granting immortality but rather some ill gotten cash to buy more time until a permanent solution was found (which I think is why the whole transhumanism agenda was being pushed pretty hard)
   Considering that they are going to be on the wrong side of karma when they die (and know it. One thing all belief systems have in common is that if you lead a terrible life, do terrible things, and impede on another's free will, the next life,  wether its reincarnation, ascension or regression to a different density, or just good old fashion heaven or hell, is lame.
   Some guy one twitter named Tommy G thinks he figured out what their code for actual adrenochrome was (my wife and I think he has too) because of the latest posts from Madonna, Oprah, Sharon Stone, and others all share the same theme. 

Roses and how they cant get any because all the florists are closed.

I was going to make a new post about it because it proves my theory false. Basically."
547,2020-03-28 14:05:22,fq0it8,"**Sympathetic nervous system**

The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is one of the two main divisions of the autonomic nervous system, the other being the parasympathetic nervous system. (The enteric nervous system (ENS) is now usually referred to as separate from the autonomic nervous system since it has its own independent reflex activity.)The autonomic nervous system functions to regulate the body's unconscious actions. The sympathetic nervous system's primary process is to stimulate the body's fight-flight-or-freeze response. It is, however, constantly active at a basic level to maintain homeostasis homeodynamics.

571,2020-03-27 08:55:09,fptmwf,SS: Ellen Degeneres seems to be wearing an anklet monitor in a few of her Instagram lives lately. I think she‚Äôs on house arrest (along with Oprah and tom hanks)

But why would a global secretive org use traditional house arrest ankle braces for these high profile house arrests? And such a bulky one at that? The anklets are monitored via gps and radio frequencies, which are [hackable](https://www.techworm.net/2015/08/security-researcher-finds-a-way-to-hack-and-disable-house-arrest-ankle-bracelet.html) by someone nearby. 

Surely a global secretive organization has access to better technology to keep their tools in place?

If the CIA had her under house arrest (maybe for her own protection?) then I would be less surprised to hear they used a traditional bracelet. 

Can we put our brains together and rent a van parked outside her house and hack the anklet?"

Your post history shows that you're reading /r/conspiracy, which is what is causing your worry. 

That place is not somewhere to get your information. You might as well consider that sub fictional. 

#Conspiracy theories... are... scams. 

They're designed to provoke you. They made up out of thin air in order to scare people, like you, and you are falling for it. They aren't worth your time. And this is clearly taking a toll on your well being. Stop going there. Stop reading that garbage.

Are **YOU** Scott W who wrote [this shit up](https://i.redd.it/9ym3ctmuixn41.jpg), and then posted about how worried you are about it? 

You're starting to seem very suspicious to me OP, and I'm not convinced that you are being honest about this.

But after that last sentence, and comparing it to what you posted earlier, I no longer think you are being genuine. Until you give us reason to think otherwise, I think it's **you** who needs to be debunked.

Then stop going there. Now. If you aren't emotionally stable enough to look at this stuff with a rational eye, then the best thing you can do is to not look at it at all. There are a lot worse things for you to be scared and anxious over than some bullshit about comets from a conspiracy theorist. 

**If you want to know about comets and asteroids, listen to the damn astronomers and scientists who study this stuff for a living and not some nutjob conspiracy lunatic on facebook.**

All you're doing is harming yourself for no reason at all. 

There is a LOT of fear mongering going around right now. Trolls are pushing misinformation on a huge scale and you are falling for it. 

Stop going to this facebook page. Stop going on /r/conspiracy. 

Start looking at the science. Start learning how to be skeptical and evaluate this stuff on your own. When you arm yourself with the right mental tools to debunk this stuff yourself, you will stop being so scared. 

>Post and for the last couple of day‚Äôs since I saw it I guess you could say I‚Äôve been obsessing over it because it just really scares me.

I get upset and angry when I see people getting scammed. And you are getting scammed right now. Someone is taking advantage of your vulnerable state and they are causing you stress and anxiety. The best thing that you can do for yourself is to cut it off at the source. 

Seriously. Instead of listening to facebook conspiracies, listen to the actual scientists and astronomers. They know what they're talking about. Scott from facebook doesn't know his ass from a handtowel. 

That will be the best thing you can do. Stop looking at the conspiracy stuff. Start looking at the science. Learn HOW science works. Learn what scientists and astronomers actually DO before going in to the specifics of comets and asteroids so that you don't fall for the trap of thinking that scientists are all in on some conspiracy.

They believe that Hollywood and the Democratic Party run a child trafficking ring that they use the blood of to become immortal Jews that run the world via the media and banks.

QAnon was a poster on 4chan or 8chan who claimed he had top secret information, about how Donald Trump's administration was about to arrest Hillary Clinton and other 'Libruls' for running a child pornography ring in a DC pizza shop. 

Ellen DeGeneres is a known liberal, so I assume they're targetting her with bullshit claims."

But I guess the mayor of PA and hospitals are ""the media.""

I had so much respect for Drew for so long and in the last two weeks lost all of it.

I would consider that ""difficult"", especially if we are talking middle of April when there's no beds or ventilators available.  On the other hand, this data was compiled on March 16, when there was only 4,226 known cases.   Hopefully, it goes down as more data is collected.

Also ""previously healthy"" doesnt mean you are healthy. Many things can be going on that you didnt know about, namely heart conditions. First sign of a heart condition is often death. I would be shocked if these young people died simply from Covid-19. In the case of the 12 year old (and I may be confusing this with another young person in bad shape) I believe that child had pneumonia first and then caught Covid for a double whammy of death. 

Of course young people will die, but the percentage is going to be a fraction of a percent at most and basically the same mortality rate of any illness on young people."

It doesn‚Äôt even care if it kills.  That‚Äôs just an unfortunate side effect.  The only mission the virus has is to spread as far and as fast as possible.  It lives in the world described by science, and that is the only way to defeat it.  

That‚Äôs why Dr. Fauci or the guy who managed the Ebola crisis, Ron Klain, should be the only one speaking to the public, and managing the logistics of testing, distribution of medical supplies, communication between federal and state agencies, etc.  Instead, we have a reality shit show, where it‚Äôs more important how things look on TV or affect the stock market than winning the actual war."
756,2020-03-26 12:23:08,fojwpk,"From the [WHO](http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov):

*Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.*

While coronaviruses in general are not new to humans, we don't know how COVID-19 in particular makes people sick.  If we knew that, we would have a vaccine.  From an [interview](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wired.com/story/coronavirus-interview-larry-brilliant-smallpox-epidemiologist/amp) with epidemiologist Larry Brilliant:

*It means it's new. That there is no human being in the world that has immunity as a result of having had it before. That means it‚Äôs capable of infecting 7.8 billion of our brothers and sisters.*

**Since it's novel, we‚Äôre still learning about it. Do you believe that if someone gets it and recovers, that person thereafter has immunity?**

*So I don't see anything in this virus, even though it's novel, [that contradicts that]. There are cases where people think that they've gotten it again, [but]¬†that's more likely to be a test failure¬†than it is an actual reinfection. But there's going to be tens of millions of us or hundreds of millions of us or more who will get this virus before it's all over, and with large numbers like that, almost anything where you ask ‚ÄúDoes this happen?‚Äù¬†can¬†happen.*"

I don't think there was a perfect way to handle this situation, but I imagine we can all agree (and perhaps this is what Jack was getting at?) that Trump's decision to not take it seriously, mock it, perpetuate the idea that it's a normal sickness, continuing to (pointedly) shake hands, etc. was not the best plan and it ultimately created a public narrative that is going to be hard to break for the less discerning pro-Trump viewer (I mean, one of my roommates isn't even pro-Trump but he's conservative and the media's take totally washed his brain so he's still going out all the time)."
840,2020-03-24 22:52:50,fo3pga,"After seeing that Kumail Nanjani cover I finally had enough and googled what ""Hard Seltzer"" is. Now that I know what White Claw and Truly are, I have also learned that there is basically no alcohol-spiked mineral water in the EU because the US are buying up the whole world's production capacity and it is going to be introduced to the European market only then when the worldwide production has increased."

Yeah that's my main argument against what Jack is saying, other countries did lockdown and they aren't governed by Trump haha. But yeah this situation could be a fuckload better if proper precautions were taken between November and March."

847,2020-03-24 13:57:56,fo09p6,Ok good I'm not the only one who keeps seeing it as that
848,2020-03-24 06:36:35,fo096x,She has a deep voice.  Never realized that before.
849,2020-04-02 15:38:01,fnsjxm,This is why I came to this sub.... Has she put out a response to these claims yet? I personally believe they are 1000% true. Some of her interviews with people are so hard to watch and she is so disrespectful... I stopped care for her years ago..
850,2020-04-05 00:02:40,fnsjxm,I think she's not... I think she can be an asshole sometimes but not like one of the meanest persons alive that's exagerating... people are just crybabies most of the examples they show from the show are pretty normal and staged and not even slightly offensive. People are so delicate nowadays. Also many youtubers now claim to know everything about ellen being mean because they know it will get them views. Like that shallow celebrity gossip youtuber claiming Ellen abuses Portia. Why is she saying that until today? Why didn't she talk before this became viral? Cause it's bullshit...
851,2020-04-23 01:49:00,fnsjxm,"Meanest alive? I don‚Äôt know about that but she is an out of touch, elitist piece of shit."

854,2020-04-13 21:13:18,fnsjxm,"Well, she's always insulting her celebrity guests. Trying to be ""edgy"" toward them, which seems unfriendly. Awkward."
855,2020-04-24 03:57:03,fnsjxm,Wow just read the twitter food bank thread. Frightening is a tweet where she‚Äôs pictured at home with a coffee table in front of her that has a decorative plate with a chain of antique skeleton keys. International symbols. So Hanks. Pizzagate.

Some muster a weak grin and eye roll, but others don‚Äôt bother to hide their irritation. Some even stomp off. She‚Äôs all‚Äùthey love my hijinks‚Äù and a couple of them had straight up murder in their eyes. 

Contrast this with Conan videos where he‚Äôs stomping around his staff, generally acting tyrannical and obnoxious, even throwing shit around, and every staff member is grinning or giggling the entire time because they know he‚Äôs clowning and they love the guy."

862,2020-08-04 01:06:13,fnsjxm,"I‚Äôve always liked to but tbh I found it quite distressing when she‚Äôd make fun of people. I remember she used to do a game where participants stood atop some kind of shelf and when they lost they‚Äôd get dropped into water or some liquid. It was clear to me that one of the women had some learning disability and Ellen took advantage of that and kept tricking her and kept laughing. It creeped me out and because the audience was so on board I wondered if I was being ultra sensitive but according to these staff stories about her, she really is mean. Seems her ‚Äúnice‚Äù persona is just a cover?for her nastiness. Bye bye Ellen, everyone now knows."

869,2020-08-04 15:36:16,fnsjxm,"Yeah this is definitely a stretch. I watched the video. None of them looked straight up pissed or with ‚Äúmurder in their eyes.‚Äù Only Andy looks bothered and that‚Äôs because he hates getting scared and it‚Äôs a common theme on the show. In fact, all of the employees are laughing. None eye roll. Only Andy."

871,2020-08-08 21:46:31,fnsjxm,"When she hung out with Bush, she defended it by equating it with hanging out with people who wear fur, implying that killing Iraqis and killing animals would be equivalent."

876,2020-08-10 05:03:01,fnsjxm,Yeah can‚Äôt stand her but you‚Äôre wrong. No death stares. Employees smiled and grinned.

893,2020-03-23 20:14:42,fnqsa2,She's a nice person. From what I remembered she got ridiculed for hanging out with George bush because he was a republican and she said something along the lines that you don't need to share beliefs with someone to be friends.
894,2020-03-23 20:30:32,fnqsa2,Don‚Äôt care

I also love that the first video of Ellen and the puzzle, she says ‚ÄúWhen I‚Äôm done, it‚Äôll look like this‚Äù, then holds up the box quickly to show that it‚Äôs the infamous painting of the fall of Rome. She‚Äôs PISSED that Hanx is allegedly singing like a canary (hence her yellow outfit). A lot of her videos were shot on the same day, yet she changed outfits multiple times. The biggest ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù in her videos by far is the bowl of keys that are identical to the necklace worn by a child in the film ‚ÄúThe Silent Children‚Äù.

936,2020-03-23 20:34:10,fnqift,"TLDR;

The cards indicate she is either warning others that someone has flipped and to prepare, or trying to warn someone who is about to flip that things are about to be very, very bad for them.

Omen cards re: warning of danger (4 of hearts), warning of betrayal (5 of spades), warning of someone's absence/death (6 of diamonds), warning of consequences for past actions (6 of hearts), and signaling to count on trusted friends (5 of clubs)"
937,2020-03-23 20:07:19,fnqift,That must be why she is visibly nervous in every single one of her isolation videos. Sure.
938,2020-03-23 20:27:13,fnqift,"There are! The 5 of clubs listed is actually a positive card, but in context with the others (see the row above), the meaning can change.

939,2020-03-23 20:28:02,fnqift,"She seems stressed. Her IG videos give me anxiety. She keeps looking around like she wants to run or start crying, fidgets all the time, and doesn't seem 'herself'. It's VERY weird."
940,2020-03-23 20:06:52,fnqift,Have you not been keeping up with the research into the weird videos? Check out the other threads on the sub for expanded info. This is just to help their interpretation of the cards themselves.
941,2020-03-24 10:05:26,fnqift,Click on it and enlarge.
942,2020-03-23 20:33:07,fnqift,"Wow! The puzzle one, I didn't even catch that! Didn't you notice how she says its a 4000 piece puzzle but there's one piece missing? I wonder what that could mean. Maybe that means the full picture won't be completed? The plan for the fall is foiled? Or maybe she is asking for someone to help her out and save themselves with her. 

Her being pissed at hanx though makes sense. She seems distraught in these card videos, like she is trying to warn others that Hanx is playing ball and spilling the beans on them all (run forrest run shirt + the card meanings warning others and possibly warning that they are about to lose someone or something very important... weinstein maybe? id keep an eye out on news regarding his 'death').

I find it strange too how she changes outfits multiple times in a day's videos, but the card ones are ALWAYS done in the run forrest run shirt.

> The biggest ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù in her videos by far is the bowl of keys that are identical to the necklace worn by a child in the film ‚ÄúThe Silent Children‚Äù. 

Wow, do you have the link to the video with those? I missed it!

I havent gotten through the madonna video yet. She literally said no more pasta? I wanna barf."

954,2020-03-23 20:10:51,fnqift,I will agree she looks like absolute shit with each passing day. But that‚Äôs probably a result of not being surrounded by her usual army of wardrobe and makeup people. Hollywood is fake as shit and we‚Äôre all going to get a glimpse of how different most of them actually look without hours in a makeup chair.
955,2020-03-23 21:00:25,fnqift,"Yeah, for a bigger perception, the main players seem to be communicating with each other (Ellen & Portia, Tom & Rita, Madonna, Oprah, and Jimmy Kimmel), under the guise of their ‚Äúfun IG stories‚Äù. I should start a tally of how many times the word ‚Äúkids‚Äù is emphasized. During Jimmy Kimmel‚Äôs video chat with Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Julia alludes to the fact that she has ‚Äúwashed off her fingerprints‚Äù and how she wishes she could have some of that ‚ÄúOprah soup‚Äù. Madonna mentions in her barrage of videos over the past few days that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no more pasta‚Äù, and that she‚Äôll have to resort to eating ‚Äúfried fish‚Äù. Pasta = little boys in pedo-occultist language. From what I can gather, the global source of their super drug has either been tainted, destroyed, or seized. The frantic, not-so-covert symbolism in their home videos shows that their panic is palpable, which means they‚Äôre probably grasping at straws. Maybe Weinstein‚Äôs inevitable death, whether real or staged, will launch a posthumous attack on all the vampire celebutards he rattled out. They did nickname him ‚ÄúThe Punisher‚Äù after all. Or, some Hollywood big-wigs (Hanx & Oprah?) made deals and blabbed in order to preserve their A-list status, with a CV infection as a cover for their untimely deaths."

959,2020-03-23 20:08:18,fnqift,"I don‚Äôt find it weird at all that she‚Äôs calling other celebrities no.

I‚Äôm not saying there aren‚Äôt rich pedophiles, and even pedophile rings or honeypots. There are prime examples of it.

This video touches on many of those things, but I was lost when they began to inject their bias or favoritism for Trump in the video as some kind of ‚Äúsavior‚Äùfrom all of this. I can provide you with a few links that prove (through his policies/actions and his cabinet choices) that Trump is a part of the deep state, and you‚Äôre falling for a false prophet form of controlled opposition.

He crosses his hands in a scissor-like fashion throughout the sketch, alluding to all of the limbs he‚Äôs cut off (i.e. the discarded shoes & gloves). I can‚Äôt take credit for this particular analyzation, I read it about a week ago. I believe someone here on Reddit wrote about it. I‚Äôll find the link and post it here.

As for Madonna, you‚Äôre right, I totally forgot about her past. She‚Äôs known as the Grand High Priestess in the darker sect of Hollywood/music industry.

Maybe they‚Äôre all being threatened to admit what they‚Äôve been doing and have only been given limited options. If I were to hypothesize what those options would be, I would guess it would be one of the following: 

1. Admit defeat and suffer through the violent withdrawals, which will most likely kill you or force your body into hyper-deterioration mode. Your death can be disguised as a Coronavirus fatality, therefore preserving your legacy and protecting those who survive you.

2. Make a deal with whatever group or organization is behind seizing or terminating the drug supply(since human trafficking is basically at a standstill right now), converting your allegiance to said group and changing your political stance in favor of theirs. In return, you‚Äôll be given a highly regulated amount of the drug, with heavy stipulations and an ironclad NDA (and most likely a synthetic version as an extra ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù). After all, the last thing those at the top of the pyramid want is for them all to be exposed. Better for some to perish and blackmail the rest into submission.

3. Admit your crimes against humanity and nature, and spend the rest of your days in publicized trials, ending in lifetime prison sentences or perhaps the death penalty. (Public executions would become en vogue again if the truth is exposed)."

1019,2020-03-23 21:19:05,fnqift,">But so far all signs are pointing toward Trump's administration draining the swamp

Personally, I have no idea if that's true or not so I'm not trying to cause an argument and obviously you have your perspective and I'm not trying to change that either, but for years the general line of thought in conspiracy theory circles was that it didn't really matter who was in charge as they were just puppets for the real elite.

Why do you think that changed with Trump? I'd imagine the people at the top are pretty astute and their various think-tanks have noted that people's trust in the media and government are at an all-time low. Wouldn't it make sense for them to put forward someone who questions the media and politicians and so have someone the public thinks is against the establishment all the while actually working for them?

Again, not trying to cause any argument and I'm open to the idea that Trump isn't that bad. To my mind, he's certainty not the evil dictator that he's often portrayed in the media, I actually think George W Bush was easily the worst president in terms of being able to bring in some sort of dictatorship as he milked 9/11 for all it was worth and seemed to have people in the media say that even questioning him was unpatriotic and wrong.

I just think that TPTB could quite easily see that a supposed anti establishment candidate is what was needed to convince the public that they could have confidence in the media/government again.

I guess I'm just curious why you (and maybe others who read this comment and think along similar lines) are so confident that Trump is a ""good guy"" and actually for the average person"

As a writer/artist myself, I find this to be the case in nearly all writing/art communities I've come into and held discussions with, so this being the case here wouldn't surprise me one bit.

However, the ties to JFK seal the deal to me. JFK was assassinated because he was trying to expose the cabal starting with the corruption in the CIA. JFK Jr. swore to finish his father's work as well as find out what really happened in terms of the assassination itself. Trump and JFK Jr. were very close. Relatively unrelated, but Trump's uncle John was a physicist who inherited Nikola Tesla's documents (most likely dealing with anti-gravity, free energy, etc) which makes all of this slightly more interesting considering how close Donald was with his uncle. I believe this plan to continue what JFK started has been in place for over 20 years."

1114,2020-04-20 10:28:16,g4krxa,"Answer: Theres a lot to unpack here, so TL;DR at the bottom.

This is gonna be a real cobweb of info so get ready... To begin, you must first get a brief synopsis of the QAnon conspiracy, which at the moment is considered a 'right-wing' conspiracy theory. It basically states that there's a deep state  (called The Cabal) that's run by the liberal elite, where they also do crazy rituals. These claims were based on email leaks of John Podesta, which were posted to WikiLeaks (which we'll get to later). It goes on to say that there's a ring is full of child exploitation and features many prominent members. 

Tom Hanks was accused of being a part of this group, but more in the Hollywood sector (Hollywood has an actual history of sexual exploition, look at Cosby and Weibstein). Other prominent people that were accused are Bill Gates and Lady Ga Ga. People have gone to point out that his reactions to Ricky Gervais's speech also allude to this. [Actor Issac Kappy had called him out on this](https://humansarefree.com/2018/08/tom-hanks-accused-of-buying-13-year-old-girl-from-her-father-and-raped-her-actor-isaac-kappy-recently-called-him-a-pedophile.html) and later Kappy himself apparently died of suicide, in which people believe he was murdered and his death was covered up because he wanted to expose the public. His death coupled with Hank's weird posting behaviour has led to an uproar. 

This all ties back into the pizzagate theory (which needs a whole new explanation on its own) which was basically a conspiracy that alluded to a pizza place harbouring child trafficking by disguising this in the form of emails using covert terms, such as cheese pizza, which meant child pornography. These emails were allegedly traced back to a large sex trafficking system involving Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein was well known amongst many persons, notably the Clinton's. Epstein was later labeled to have committed suicide whilst in a maximum security prison that was under 24/7 surveillance by guards and cameras, yet many find this suspicious and believe that he was instead murdered. The other claim going around is that Hanks flew with Epstein on the Lolita express, a private island of Epsteins where child trafficking had gone on. Trump had also addressed these accusations, where he claimed that they were true and that the elites must be stopped. [The whole pizzagate thing is briefly addressed in this CBS report too if you're interested](https://www.instagram.com/tv/B-xTA39gaDf/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

Now bear with me, people are now saying that Tom Hanks might've been arrested for paedophilia and the Tom Hanks we saw on the quarantine edition of SNL is actually a deep fake, since he looks looked a bit younger and had a kitchen that was too small for a millionaire's home (people think it was all greenscreened). Then people began doubting his claim of getting infected from Covid-19

As of now, people think he was finally caught up and exposed by the public, so he fled to Australia, with some even claiming that he's got a warrant out for his arrest in the U.S. People believe that he's now being investigated by the Cia too. Others have claimed that he is already caught and imprisoned, but news of this isn't public. Finally, two recent documentaries that are claiming to expose this ring came out on YouTube with the title Out of the Shadows and Pedogate 2020, which helped get this theory going again.

There are also a lot of Russian comments I noticed on his insta; luckily I can read Russian and most of them said for Hank to stop buying kids and murdering them for his own enjoyment and for development of an alleged drug called Adrenochrome (this is supposed to be the drug of the elite and its featured in the movie/book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas as a fictional drug). 

This rabbit hole goes much deeper and I only scratched the surface of this theory. Many claim this is the truth and others explain that this is just a hoax made by the right wingers; I personally don't know. I tried my best to sum it up lol. Feel free to point out any errors/inconsistencies so that I can fix them! )) 

TL;DR Tom Hanks is allegedly involved with a group of elites paedophiles that traffics children and murders them; this claim gained more traction because of the death of Issac Kappy after 'calling Hanks out' and several documentaries posted to YouTube that are recently addressing this topic."

1168,2020-04-20 08:04:24,g4krxa,"These are big accusations to be leveling and to be stitching together, without any receipts.

It's one thing to suggest that Hollywood is about money and power - of course it is, it's a major business. Not that big a leap either that the rich and powerful, some of which are in Hollywood have access to networks of child sex traffickers. Worth noting that those people are not always beyond being exposed- see Dennis Hastert (although it's an absolute fucking crime he only did 13 months). Networks operating around foster care have been broken up before.

Now, you are asking people to take a huge leap of faith going from that point to the rich and powerful are child-murdering vampires, and apparently the only hard evidence of this is a video that may or may not exist and some easily spoofed posts? Don't tell me that's not a big leap of faith you expect people to take."
1169,2020-04-20 07:57:00,g4krxa,"Maybe because of stuff he's making up -- like ""he was on Epstein's flight log"" -- no, Tom Hanks wasn't. There was a badly spelt list that circulated amongst right-wing conspiracy folk purporting to be Epstein's flight log (with no source, of course) which coincidentally turned out to be a list of liberals or critics of Trump. 

It was just a list that someone (most likely not a native English speaker) had made up. 

I mean I could waste time and go through all the made-up shit in that answer, but there's no point -- the poster hasn't bothered to fact check any of it. 

So, sure you can't see a reason other than ""being afraid it's true"" but ""it's mostly a bunch of made-up right-wing fantasies"" is a pretty good reason, which seems to have flown way overt your head."

If you actually think you aren‚Äòt biased, you might be a lost cause. But please wake the fuck up, for your own good as well as that of everyone around you."

1228,2020-04-20 08:25:24,g4krxa,"Literally the only find relating to the Brad Pitt quote on the first 3 pages of multiple google searches is that the thing you tried to quote is not from a real interview, but a made up one. 

And what you said is just semantics. If you preface an argument by saying ‚ÄöI don‚Äòt say this is a fact, but this is what people say‚Äò, only to explain in great length what these people believe without a single moment of questioning or a sign of thinking by yourself - then you don‚Äòt REALLY say that this isn‚Äòt your opinion. What you say is ‚ÄöI don‚Äòt want to be called out on my shit, but this is what I believe‚Äò.

This tactic is and was used not just by conspiracy theorists such as yourself, but also by regimes, cults and discriminatory groups for hundreds of years now.

‚ÄöThis isn‚Äòt my opinion, but word on the street is that jews are dirty money hogging animals that are worth less than the arian people living here‚Äò.

The tool you use to spread disinformation and lies is the same tool the nazis used. The same tool people use to spread their sick ideas about other human beings being worth less than themselves. It is just used for a different cause in your case, but that does NOT make it right.

Just because you say it is not your opinion doesn‚Äòt mean we can‚Äòt read between the fucking lines. If you spread rumors and myths like this without questioning them a single time, completely unironically with the statement ‚Äöwe will see what is true‚Äò - then you can say that this isn‚Äòt your opinion a million times. Everyone reading knows that this is a lie. You do, I do and anyone able to stop and think for a second knows."

They whole lives are bound to us loving them and praising them and go to see their movies and buy their albums.I couldn't ever bring myself to adore someone who was desperate for likes of me to pay and buy from them.

 That's like me adoring the grocery store or Walmart. It does not really make sense.to them it's business, it should be business for us too. I like this album and I buy it but I know the person making it can be a really dumb/cruel/asshole human being. So when it turns out some one is an Asshole I don't get crushed I just stop soppurting an Asshole."

1257,2020-04-20 07:48:11,g4cbz1,"Yeah right. The celeb culture is going to always be a thing. Same with drugs and people doing them. You can't stop people worshiping it. Look at Trump. He was a celeb and he is the president. Look how careless he was leading up to this and guess what? People still support him because he knows what to say to people and it doesn't matter if it is fact or not as long as people believe him.

There will always be methheads, crackheads, fuckboys, assholes, and bitches. That is okay because they are human. We don't know what their lives are behind the curtain or why they are they are.

The only thing I see from this pandemic is how careless everyone was about it. We have nukes that can blow up the world 100 times over, and we put money into our defense budget that can kill humans but if it is something that is non human the world doesn't give a shit. ""It is just another flu"". We evolved so much that going to war with something that is nonhuman is not something we ever worry about. We were lucky Ebola didn't spread like this. It would have been a bigger nightmare.

I might lose people to this stupid damn pandemic. I moved away from my family because of their abuse but I might not be able to see them again because of this. I might lose friends. I know others have and they are suffering."

Our typical world has these extremely vertical social hierarchies where a few are assigned significantly greater value than most. Right now the hierarchy is more horizontal and equal, and perhaps some good will come from it."
1263,2020-04-20 05:09:34,g4cbz1,"A lot of them got exposed. We the simple people see them as ""larger than life"" and all that shit. People idolize them. But at the end of the day,they feel stressed,are vulnerable,having feelings,do dumb shit just like everyone like us. This facade was there even back in the 40‚Äôs.

9/11 was a single event that was over and done with. Apart from the shock and the obvious disruption to a single city, most people just carried on with their lives.

This is different. VERY different.

This backlash against celebs has been the most savage and unanimous I've ever seen. Normally it's just one or two celebs who've truly fucked up and trashed their reputation, but this is an entire fucking industry. I don't know that this has ever happened before, not in the last 100 years anyway... The public just seem to be completely and utterly done with them, like they were getting tired of them already but this is just the last nail in the coffin.

They say it takes 21 days to form a habit, we're well past that now.

I think we'll find when we all emerge from our bunkers that a lot of inane bullshit has been permanently deleted from the world."

1301,2020-04-19 01:58:09,g3zixt,I think that like most daytime TV her show is insufferably bland and the only reason she's even as popular as she is is because she's Hollywood's token lesbian.

She likes to pull mean pranks on her guests which to me is abhorrent.

She presents as a mean-spirited person. Obviously she's endured a lot of criticism for coming out. And obviously she's helped promote a lot of LGBTQ+ people and causes. I'm a huge Greyson Chance fan due in large part to her initial efforts to promote and then manage him.

But does any of that really make-up for how hurtful some of her jokes have been ‚Äî especially the one about comparing life in prison to life holed-up in her $45 million dollar home? Or how she seems to be treating the workers she claims to love? No and no.

1326,2020-04-21 01:51:12,g3lyxs,This. She's been a horrible person who uses her power to hurt others for years
1327,2020-04-18 19:55:11,g3lyxs,"Being that her net worth is around $500mil, she most definitely could."
1328,2020-04-18 14:33:55,g3lyxs,Can you explain?
1329,2020-04-18 17:01:45,g3lyxs,This post really exemplifies the disastrous state of the American left.
1330,2020-04-18 15:00:41,g3lyxs,"I'm guessing it's be ause she went to a football game with George W. Bush.  I'm not a Bush fan but this is completely stupid.  The Obama's are friendly with Bush, but I doubt OP would describe them as ""friendly with war criminals"" so this has no teeth"
1331,2020-04-18 19:49:22,g3lyxs,"Exactly. According to the left, isn't everyone basically Hitler? Is it actually possible to even complete a single English sentence without somehow being responsible for every single episode of oppression which has ever happened in human history?"
1332,2020-04-18 18:48:39,g3lyxs,This post exemplifies the hypocrisy of the liberal as well as down right ignorance of history.
1333,2020-04-18 16:12:34,g3lyxs,"From a certain point of view, Obama is also a war criminal."
1334,2020-04-18 15:51:16,g3lyxs,I would. Bush is a war criminal. Anyone being friends with him is therefore friendly with a war criminal.
1335,2020-04-18 19:51:45,g3lyxs,"According to the left, everyone who have ever assumed someone's gender  is worse than a war criminal, so I wouldn't worry too much."
1336,2020-04-18 19:50:26,g3lyxs,"Surely anyone who is friends with a war criminal is even worse than a war criminal - basically like 2 Hitlers (to use the official units). And anyone who is friends with them is therefore even worse, probably around 3 Hitlers."
1337,2020-04-18 20:04:36,g3lyxs,Ok. I guess I shouldn't worry about war criminals.
1338,2020-04-18 20:33:48,g3lyxs,"Not by the standards of the far left, because according to them my 4 year old nephew is a war criminal for using the pronoun 'he' once."
1339,2020-04-19 04:10:43,g3lyxs,"Just out of curiosity, how many people has your 4 year old nephew murdered?"
1340,2020-04-19 09:57:23,g3lyxs,"According to the far left, by assuming that someone has a gender, he has done something just as a bad if not worse than the Holocaust. So in effect, the answer to your question is some number > 6 million."
1341,2020-04-18 11:26:16,g3lyv3,Yip she is a real b*tch. Dont watch her show. She is a sociopath.
1342,2020-04-18 11:38:41,g3lyr9,"There are two types of people,  like Ellen, who pretend on screen to be generous.

1349,2020-04-18 13:42:20,g3ijxb,Most of these celebrities are two faced. Not that I expected her to be any different but I have wondered when her true colors were going to be revealed
1350,2020-04-18 06:18:58,g3ijxb,I stopped to like her ages ago
1351,2020-04-18 12:30:30,g3ijxb,War criminal?
1352,2020-04-18 15:06:13,g3ijxb,Ellen DeGenerates
1353,2020-04-19 00:38:53,g3ijxb,"This is a person you don‚Äôt know. You‚Äôre basing your opinion on rumor. 1) until you‚Äôve been a business owner dealing with a Union telling you they‚Äôll destroy your business unless you meet their demands (not the employee demands, the union‚Äôs demands!)  don‚Äôt vilify people for working with non union workers.  2) is she a terrible person because she won‚Äôt use material for her show that she doesn‚Äôt like? No. Her show is a success BECAUSE of her choices to do only certain material. 3) is she mean because she‚Äôs tired of waiters constantly asking her to be in a skit, or trying to butter her up to benefit them or their career?  I would imagine that gets pretty old. Grow up and realize that you don‚Äôt impact her life at all, so she shouldn‚Äôt impact yours."
1354,2020-04-18 17:42:22,g3ijxb,Im not really a fan of her myself but can I ask where you got your information?
1355,2020-04-18 15:53:46,g3ijxb,"No, I thought she was quite nice though"

It's essentially like I said. She was a tyrannical boss who treated her workers like shit and fired her Unionized staff to replace them with non-Union staff."

1360,2020-04-18 16:40:30,g3hwh4,"That was really, really fun. I'm not even that upset about not brushing my hair or speaking up. I was especially happy to see Martha Previte, Jim Earl, Harvey J. Kaye, Corey Brettschneider, Jennifer Verdolin, and of course David! It was kind of amazing being able to see some of the regulars who we've been listening to for (some of us) years. For me, staying awake until 5am here in England was difficult, but worth it."
1361,2020-04-18 05:37:01,g3hwh4,"It was good. I listened in but didn't turn on my camera.

I didn't catch the teaching difficulties thing or I may have contributed. Was listening and cleaning at the time."

1363,2020-04-19 14:40:54,g3hwh4,Did David ever get around to Kai on the pet parade?  That was impressive cat handling by Kai.
1364,2020-04-21 16:19:46,g3hwh4,So we're not gonna talk about Dave from the rust belt's dog's asshole?
1365,2020-04-18 20:21:47,g3hwh4,Really cool connecting names to faces i agree.
1366,2020-04-18 15:19:14,g3hwh4,"Mabye In the future a whole zoom meeting dedicated to listeners who are teachers, listeners who are healthcare workers."

That's it. If you're not going to pay them, say so. She isn't even giving them that. At the bare minimum, she DOES owe them that. As an employer, you're obligated to be transparent and when you're playing mind games with people and their pay, that's when you start losing your people."
1402,2020-04-18 12:29:08,g381d6,If Ellen was kind we wouldn't be having this conversation.

1406,2020-04-18 10:01:13,g381d6,">an ethical obligation

Dude. These people have a very peculiar set of ethics.

That being said, I don't get it why people still cling to media gigs in 2020. You'll be like 100 times more financially secure if you learn a trade."
1407,2020-04-17 21:59:01,g381d6,"My favorite story about her from that recent twitter thread was the person who works on her show that said Ellen picks one person every day to hate and their life sucks for the entire day. When it's your day, you just suck it up and take it because tomorrow it will be someone else.

Imagine treating people like that."

1409,2020-04-17 20:04:28,g381d6,If they are not working then they will not be paid by their employer. California's unemployment system with a $600 weekly bonus is working just fine. They are also going to get at least $1200 from the economic impact program.

1412,2020-04-17 19:46:51,g381d6,Oh no I agree 100%. I just think it‚Äôs literally the reason that she has most if not all of what she has. It‚Äôs why people praise her and stuff.
1413,2020-04-17 22:27:25,g381d6,"Also imagine working for someone like that... I don't care how much money you have, I'll call your ass out in a heartbeat and tell you to fuck off as I walk my happy ass out the door."
1414,2020-04-18 08:24:20,g381d6,"Bro no one is saying that she should be legally forced to pay everyone. But in a worldwide crisis, the likes of which have never been seen in America, it would be nice if people with hundreds of millions in the bank could fucking step up and help their employees out. Particularly when they have made a career out of acting like they are morally superior to others."
1415,2020-04-17 20:15:17,g381d6,"You're missing the point all together. For one, you don't know what their wages are or how they're paid. For two, they still deserve an answer one way or another. No need to dance around it. Answer your people on whether they're going to get paid or not and let them move on if they so choose. You don't just start getting unemployment because you're not working. If you're still employed, you're not getting unemployment. If you quit, you're not getting unemployment and you're right back to not making money anyway. You have to be laid off in this instance, of which that hasn't happened for them. Also, 1200 isn't something to live on, especially in the tax haven of California. It's to hold you afloat so you can eat and get necessities. But let's keep making excuses for this trash human being that leaves her employees in the dark."
1416,2020-04-18 14:51:05,g381d6,She is definitely no Carol Burnett!

1418,2020-04-18 15:40:09,g381d6,She has never acted like she is morally superior then others.
1419,2020-04-17 20:28:32,g381d6,If your employer tells you you are not working then you have your answer. This is how the god damn unemployment system works.
1420,2020-04-18 17:24:51,g381d6,It is kind of amusing that someone would go so far as to call other people stupid given they were dumb enough to get themselves banned.
1421,2020-04-17 22:02:02,g381d6,"That's not how any of this works. ""you aren't coming in this week because we don't have work for you"" is different from ""you're being laid off/furloughed because we can't afford to keep you onboard"". One allows you to file unemployment and start looking for new work, the other traps you in a holding pattern where you can't collect UI, aren't getting paid, and job shopping means quitting your current job which can make the hiring process more difficult if you get an offer.

Then you have what Ellen is doing, and not saying anything at all, trapping her employees in limbo of not knowing if they're employed or not, if they'll have a job when her show starts up, or anything. You talk like someone who has never worked as an employee or knows anything about managing them."
1422,2020-04-17 20:29:36,g381d6,"If they tell you to stay home but don't tell you you're out of a job, that's not unemployment. Gtfo."
1423,2020-04-17 20:37:18,g381d6,If your employer tells you not to come to work then that means you are unemployed.
1424,2020-04-18 03:42:39,g381d6,Have you ever worked a job in your life? Maybe come back to us when you finish middle school.
1425,2020-04-19 01:45:17,g36ggv,I have known SO many people who worked for her and she's worse then some of the stories you read. Its such an open secret in hollywood. Go to any bar where crew hang out and you will hear ENDLESS stories of how she treats the people she works for.
1426,2020-07-06 18:24:53,g36ggv,"I worked on the Ellen Show as a sound engineer back around 2010, and she was still bitchy then. One particular anecdote (if you care); during one of the rehearsals I had to make an adjustment to one of the frequencies on her lapel microphone. Unfortunately, that meant it would go mute for a couple seconds. I told the producer and the tech director and they both said to go ahead and do what I needed to do, even if it turned her mic off for a second. Long story short, I did it, she got mad and started yelling for ""that asshole in-charge of sound"" to get his (my) job together. The producer tried to defend me saying that he said to do it, but she just yelled at him too. To summarize, she's an asshole, and has been one since at 2010"
1427,2020-04-17 18:40:23,g36ggv,No.
1428,2020-07-10 14:23:41,g36ggv,Yeah shes always been an asshole. Gulliable women worship her.

1430,2020-08-20 19:54:45,g36ggv,The current spin is that ‚ÄúEllen isn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs just an introvert.‚Äù She also doesn‚Äôt want the employees she allowed to be terrorized to come back to work feeling afraid that she and her replacement flying monkeys won‚Äôt retaliate against them blowing the whistle on her and trashing her reputation.  If I worked there my phone would be recording everything and I would have their hr person on speed dial. But I think she‚Äôs definitely an asshole.  Too many stories to think otherwise
1431,2020-09-22 02:49:22,g36ggv,"I work on the WB lot every now and then where ellen is filmed. She will have a Production Assistant stand at  the corner of the street at the exit of the lot, asking pedestrians not to walk during the walk signal so she can make the left turn  without having to waiting for the people to cross. That should tell you everything you'd ever need to know about her."
1432,2020-04-24 01:05:58,g36ggv,"Yeah I‚Äôll just go to the bars where her crew hang out cuz you know, we all live in Hollywood. Care to share any stories?"

I had always been interested in art, and it was really fun to take mainly art classes for 4 years. There, I learned basics of designing on Illustrator and Photoshop and from my random jobs out of college, I learned more about graphic design. I also taught Chess everything he knows about designing! He was a high school teacher when we met, and just recently switched over to full time working for our company. Together we make all the card & art print designs, and we collaborated on all of the book illustrations too :)"

However, the information in the book is just as important as the illustrations, i'd say :) <3"

Kim knew Ellen for a period of time. she was in a lesbian-girl hangout group with her. idk what else to call it üòÇ. she was in the group for a few months. ellen was a bit of a dick but everyone accepted that, she was kinda in charge. people would fluctuate in and out of the group according to ellens wants. Kim said that it felt good when Ellen liked her. 


Kim mentioned a story where Ellen once dumped her girlfriend by leaving her in her house and a note, telling the woman to move out by the end of the day, because it just didn‚Äôt work out. i think they were dating for awhile too!! pretty cold. anyway, Kim got kicked out of the group a few months later when Ellen found out she was not, infact, a lesbian. i wonder if Kim pretended to be or if it wasn‚Äôt mentioned. i can‚Äôt imagine a group of lesbians not talking about how they‚Äôre lesbians... maybe she flew by as Bi? 


not the craziest shit, but cool to get an in on her life back then, when she was like, queen of the lesbians. i wish i could remember more details about the story. if you‚Äôve got any questions you can ask me and I‚Äôll text Kim and ask her. i don‚Äôt like using her for her stories but i will if i have to!!!! (Kim is not her real name) üòÇ

EDIT: i really got on my soap box and forgot to tell u the point of the story. Ellen was only interested in people she could sleep with. when she got tired of them they were gone. when they were too much work they were gone. when she found
out they def aren‚Äôt lesbian - gone. she was a dick to people who liked her. and who could say she even liked them. it was when Kim told that story when i thought... damn, Ellen is kinda a sleezy bitch. and a bit of a predator."

1565,2020-05-03 22:07:54,gco02x,"I cant comment on this show specifically (a bit before my time and never caught reruns), but a lot of modern shows are made to be ambiguous and appeal to any given audience member's personal preference so that a single show will appeal to a much wider number of people. 

So a lot of the time you'll have a character say something and a chunk of the audience will think they are speaking absolute truth word for word; another portion will think it's a bit over the top but in the ballpark of reality; a 3rd will think it's hilarious parody and sendup of the people who think like this; while the 4th will think it's great absurdist humor and cant imagine a real life situation where anyone could believe anything even approaching that - the key overlap of all 4 audience demographics being that they watched and enjoyed the content and want to see more. 

A good example of this that comes to mind for myself (and which is likely relevant to us discussing The Man Show) would be the character of Barney Stinson from How I Met Your Mother.

So anyway, sorry for the mini wall of text, it can take a surprising amount of space to type a few seconds of thought. The Tl;Dr is that while the writers probably intentionally put in some content to support your personal take on their work, it's by no means a view that is held by the majority of the audience and certainly not ""more correct""; it's just the interpretation that appeals more to your personal tastes."

1660,2020-05-03 16:58:17,gco02x,Conans actions are creepy too but he didn't go as far and started to take off her clothes on live TV like Ellen did.
1661,2020-05-03 12:04:01,gco02x,At least your straight up about it üëç
1662,2020-05-03 10:21:46,gco02x,I mean I‚Äôm not worked up. I‚Äôm drinking my coffee and having a bowl rn I‚Äôm chillin. I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs a common double standard and is in general fucked up. Obv what Ellen does has no bearing on my life. I just don‚Äôt like the double standards of sexual harassment and assault. As a woman I don‚Äôt feel like I can demand respect and assault to be taken seriously and also not care when a woman does those same predatory things.
1663,2020-05-03 10:32:56,gco02x,Because you said you dislike her alot but still defend her sexual predatory behaviours.
1664,2020-05-03 12:54:04,gco02x,"My reply also was about the other examples too. Gross, not predatory"
1665,2020-05-03 16:50:49,gco02x,"Those aren‚Äôt equivalent scenarios at all.  My point is, if an actor was uncomfortable with her behavior, the team would let her team know, and the antics would stop."
1666,2020-05-03 23:03:19,gco02x,Go file a complaint with your local Obama-appointed  universit√§tszensor
1667,2020-05-03 17:01:21,gco02x,Bad take.
1668,2020-05-03 10:34:51,gco02x,"this isn‚Äôt a children‚Äôs book super villain. This is real life, just because you don‚Äôt like someone doesn‚Äôt mean you have to hate everything he or she does. You basically admit here you make this argument because you hate her."
1669,2020-05-03 12:56:06,gco02x,But they are. If Mario was made to do something he didn't want how is that not predatory? She exploited his body for views.
1670,2020-05-03 17:25:38,gco02x,Do you know this from extensive work with production teams? How do you know this for sure?
1671,2020-05-03 23:10:02,gco02x,"Relax, you will strain your fingers."
1672,2020-05-03 10:36:00,gco02x,No it's you rather hate her for everything else than actual harassment. That's the part that is shocking.
1673,2020-05-03 13:05:18,gco02x,"I don‚Äôt want to go to work. I do it because I get paid. I‚Äôm not being exploited. Just because I don‚Äôt want to do something under one condition (not being paid) doesn‚Äôt mean the other condition (being paid) is invalid. 

Is a news anchor being exploited for views? Or the Vice President for helping the ticket? Or an employee for boosting profit? Or a kid whose parents make him mow the lawn?"
1674,2020-05-03 10:41:42,gco02x,so because I don‚Äôt see those actions as sexual predatory behaviour and harassment I... I what exactly? because I really don‚Äôt see where you are trying to go with this.
1675,2020-05-03 13:25:00,gco02x,"So your saying touching someone at a job is fine as long as they get paid even though they don't like it? Have you even read the definition of what is classed as sexual predatory behaviours?

You not wanting to do a job but AGREEING to do it anyway is not the same as SEXUAL exploitation 

You do a job that you agreed to but if its out with your contract agreement then yes that is wrong.


Your example is completed different from what the actual point is."
1676,2020-05-03 13:31:56,gco02x,"Just a thought , capitalism is predatory."
1677,2020-05-03 10:55:14,gco02x,You are part of the problem. Calling me prudish for  defending sexual harassment. Just because you can't see it doesn't change that it is.
1678,2020-05-03 13:30:02,gco02x,"If they‚Äôre getting paid to be touched 100% yes it‚Äôs fine. 

Your definition encompasses a bunch of completely innocent things. A boy asking a kiss a girl he took to prom counts with you. Your definition is too broad. 

You can.... quit. Or.... say.... this wasn‚Äôt in my contact. At that point if they don‚Äôt back down sure, predatory. But if they say would you do it for a fat check, and then you say yes, not predatory.

Like I‚Äôd youre an actress and get asked to do a nude scene, not predatory. If you don‚Äôt want to do one but 100,000$ convinces you otherwise, not predatory."
1679,2020-05-03 13:39:13,gco02x,"Just a thought, any activity where a person recognizes that another person needs/wants a good or set ice and offers to provide that in exchange for a good or service they need/want in return is predatory. Like o said. This definition sucks.

That‚Äôs the basis of capitalism. I think it‚Äôs stupid to call that predatory given how it‚Äôs been the basis of basically all human activity for thousands of years but we can agree to disagree if you‚Äôd like."
1680,2020-05-03 10:57:09,gco02x,Must be pretty windy on top of that high horse of yours
1681,2020-05-03 22:16:58,gco02x,This conversation is starting to go way over your head lol
1682,2020-05-03 13:44:55,gco02x,No that would be a fair exchange of goods. Capitalism is where a person isn‚Äôt providing any good or service but benefits from the labors of others by leveraging capital. In your example if I bought you all your goods at one rate and then resold them at a profit because now I have all that particular good . I used your labor to make me money by leveraging my capitol to create artificial scarcity and then reaping those rewards.  This is predatory.
1683,2020-05-03 10:58:36,gco02x, Contribute to the discussion not insults.
1684,2020-05-03 13:51:30,gco02x,"K. But that is literally a service. Middlemen do provide a service (albeit one that nobody complains when it‚Äôs cut out). A person who buys a good at a price, moves it and sells it for profit somewhere else is doing what you described. We call those people truckers. Another example is a person who leveraged their capital to say, pay people to build a house and then chargers rent. 

And that‚Äôs a definition of capitalism I‚Äôve literally never heard anyone ever give before. 

Although I will say that 1. Although I think the term is so vague as to be meaningless if there‚Äôs a more productive economic system I‚Äôm down. I don‚Äôt describe myself as a capitalist, nor do I support it inherently. 2. People can absolutely fuck people over even in a voluntary exchange of goods. Like the 900$ aids pill. I would agree that‚Äôs predatory.  My point is specific to how simply doing something you otherwise wouldn‚Äôt do in order to get money is not a victim of a predator make. That‚Äôs literally how all jobs work."
1685,2020-05-03 11:00:14,gco02x,What discussion? You are literally pronouncing your opinion as facts over and over. You never had any intention of having a discussion.
1686,2020-05-03 13:57:30,gco02x,"See you added things.  This is called a goal post shift, let‚Äôs not do that. If someone transports the goods they added value that‚Äôs not what is being discussed. Rent is they very definition of predatory capitalism as you aren‚Äôt providing anything that wouldn‚Äôt exist if the person renting had sufficient capitol.  You describe predatory things as if there isn‚Äôt a different way. Have you never heard of other economic systems. Do you have to work to live ? If so does someone make profit off your labor without adding value to the process? If so you are not involved in a fair exchange of goods you are being taken advantage of by a predatory system kept in place by the people who see you as prey."
1687,2020-05-03 11:02:25,gco02x,You have nothing to add apart from condescending replies. Thanks for commenting.

1689,2020-05-04 00:56:02,gco02x,"I didn‚Äôt move the goal posts. I gave different examples of voluntary exchange. That‚Äôs not moving anything. You gave an example of a person who buys goods and sells them at a higher price as predatory. I gave you an example of a person doing that that isn‚Äôt predatory. Nothing moved.

Yes, you have to work to live. At least most people. Accounting profit. Maybe. Economic profit? Maybe. But most people who do make profit also add value to your labor. More importantly, labor is not the only mechanism to add value. For example, Information is another."

1692,2020-05-03 14:03:54,gco02x,You keep telling yourself that and it won‚Äôt make it one bit truer ( we are talking renting shelter btw not a car or dvd)
1693,2020-05-04 00:59:34,gco02x,No you added that that person moves those goods thats not what we were talking about.  That exactly what goal post shifting is. Your whole 2nd paragraph is word salad drivel. Labor is the only way to increase product value. Information about a product doesn‚Äôt add value. Cookies aren‚Äôt worth more because I know the calorie count
1694,2020-05-03 14:08:41,gco02x,[deleted]
1695,2020-05-04 01:45:32,gco02x,"Information absolutely adds value. Technology is one example. The Bessemer process for steel production drastically increased the amount of steel a given amount of labor could produce. Methods to refine and drill oil like fracking are also great examples. Demographic data and shopping patterns are more digital ones but they are absolutely of value. And in the age of computers a person can build a machine that can do computations for years creating value well beyond the initial labor input. And if you want a near perfect example, software code. 100% adds value but also isn‚Äôt labor.

Yes. You gave an example. I gave a counter example within the parameters of your original example. Just because I added something doesn‚Äôt mean the goal posts shifted."
1696,2020-05-03 14:09:47,gco02x,Yes yes yes I‚Äôm sorry but anytime anyone makes profit off of a necessity that is predatory.
1697,2020-05-04 01:47:48,gco02x,Code is absolutely labor. Who wrote the code ? Someone who did what ? You describe labor ( meaning someone‚Äôs work) adding value then claim the value was added somewhere else somehow.
1698,2020-05-03 14:13:12,gco02x,[deleted]
1699,2020-05-04 03:29:00,gco02x,Writing code is labor. But that code itself is simply information. It never goes away. Never decays. Doesn‚Äôt need any labor to keep its value. After it‚Äôs creation it exists on a completely different plane than labor.
1700,2020-05-03 14:15:36,gco02x,How about they work to provide value like everyone else. We don‚Äôt need an owner class sorry I have to be the one to tell you. Most parents treat that idea like Santa

1707,2020-05-03 17:20:53,gcjzpn,I still think if Ellen hadn‚Äôt buddied up to GW Bush at a baseball game nobody would be talking about this.
1708,2020-05-06 01:05:12,gcjzpn,Ellen should quit her show and just enjoy her millions.

1781,2020-05-02 17:59:25,gc7m9s,This is the issue. It's not Ellen's job to pay studio employees. It's the studios.
1782,2020-05-02 16:58:19,gc7m9s,I've hated him for years. Way before he started making you guys over there suffer...
1783,2020-05-02 16:51:56,gc7m9s,Pussy is a more appropriate word.
1784,2020-05-02 17:32:43,gc7m9s,"In fairness, her relevance is pretty miniscule now.  Her coming out was a big thing for the time.

Today, her being gay?  No one gives a shit."
1785,2020-05-02 18:24:16,gc7m9s,"I remember when I was younger I didn't like her show Ellen. People were like, because she's gay? I said no, it's just not funny."
1786,2020-05-02 16:38:24,gc7m9s,Accurate.
1787,2020-05-02 18:07:36,gc7m9s,"No one gives a shit that she's gay.   To be honest, no one really gave a shit when she came out.  The people that did, you still have to deal with."
1788,2020-05-02 19:43:11,gc7m9s,"Some really flip out when you call them hypocrites in my experience. Been there. And it seems the more concrete and undeniable the evidence is, the more pissed they get."
1789,2020-05-02 19:46:54,gc7m9s,"Yeah, I never understood why people like Steve ""I cannot believe you said words on THE FUED"" Harvey 

He's an idiot to start with, and by far the LEAST funny OG ""King"" of comedy.

I wasn't a huge Bernie Mac fan, but I'd throw a million Steve Harvey's into a volcano for one Mac.

The shit MLK would have to say about Harvey..."
1790,2020-05-02 18:57:42,gc7m9s,"Easy to be charitable when you are that rich. Not saying that big philanthropy doesnt do good, but let's stop acting like they are good people just because they donate money to charities. A lot of people donate tons of money for image control, which Ellen does very successfully even though multiple people who have been on her show have seen her treat her staff shittily. Most people dont have a problem with her donating to charity, as good deeds dont cancel out bad ones. If I treat 100+ staff like shit but donate millions to charity, I expect you to come out of the woodwork to support me.

Edit: a word"
1791,2020-05-02 18:52:49,gc7m9s,"Nah, fuck her for teaming up with the homophobic and otherwise problematic Steve Harvey years ago for a big pay day."

1804,2020-05-02 18:52:01,gc7m9s,"I agree that the studios should be paying and not Ellen, but from other people's stories about being on her talk show, shes a massive dousche to her staff regardless of coronavirus. The studios are not going to budge about this, as they can lay blame on the talk show hosts. Fight the good fight all you want, but these talk show hosts make a lot of money and if there is anyone who can help out the massive staff on these shows to make sure they can survive, it's the hosts. The hosts used to work with these guys and depend on their skills for their shows. She shouldn't be blamed for not paying her staff, but it all adds up with her not treating her staff well to make her look like a shitty person. She should just be blamed for being a shitty person."
1805,2020-05-02 22:01:32,gc7m9s,"Is it not the case that the network pays the production company for the show.  ""A Very Good Production"" will get the funds from the studio for X number of shows per season and  it's the production company that employs the staff.  So really the production company should pick up the bill.  In this case, ""A Very Good Production"" is the employer which is owned by Ellen DeGeneres and she's currently the CEO."
1806,2020-05-02 18:46:05,gc7m9s,It's like piers Morgan. Can we have less cunts and more John Olivers and Patrick Stewarts

1818,2020-05-02 19:23:39,gc7m9s,"Oh just how she preaches that the government should take care of people.  Everyone should have a living wage. Everyone deserves a big ol house.

I just think you insulted comedians as a profession by calling her such.

She's never been funny a day in her life, I don't know how she ever got a show, and seriously, if she weren't gay and didn't have her show's bigoted cancellation to springboard from, she'd be bagging groceries right now.

I guess I just assume most people think as little of celebs as I do, so I assume it outwardly, my fault."

But it's a good gesture. But preaching as she does for equality and living wages, and then not be willing to front the cost when it matters definitely makes a person look greedy and looks like they care more for appearances than actually doing good.

This situation has shown true colors for many people and companies."

However, I watched a YouTube video where she was asking a millennial (like myself) details about The Beatles in order to make our generation appear stupid as a joke. She made a lot of smart ass comments as the girl was thinking about the names and I got annoyed with her while I was watching. I realized she was trying to be funny, but fuck her."

I mean, her show is presumably rated exactly as high as reflects the vast number of people who watch it. Saying her shows sucks or some other statement would seem a fair thing you could argue, but saying it is overrated seems more like a judgement that people who do like it, like it too much, which would really be better decided by fans than people who dislike it, I would think."

1913,2020-04-30 18:39:07,garnpk,It‚Äôs a show for women. I‚Äôve never watched it.
1914,2020-04-30 22:48:52,garnpk,Not unpopular
1915,2020-04-30 08:19:22,garnpk,"I wouldn‚Äôt say she is ‚Äúroasting the shit‚Äù out of them, she just makes them really awkward. Don‚Äôt give her too much credit."
1916,2020-04-30 13:19:20,garnpk,Yes.  She's a known b#$^h in real life.
1917,2020-04-30 10:15:47,garnpk,Why?
1918,2020-04-30 10:21:17,garnpk,But why do the artists tell her that they love her so much? Are they afraid they won't get as much fans?
1919,2020-04-30 16:26:18,garnpk,Gay man here. I fucking hate Ellen.

1929,2020-04-30 10:20:05,garnpk,"Raising money (when you're sb like Ellen) is no big deal in my opinion (but it's a good deed).
She knows it helps her popularity + what does she as a person do? 
It's like Bezos raising money for his workers in times of corona instead of paying them more."
1930,2020-04-30 16:23:50,garnpk,Lots of bad Ellen press over the last 2 weeks

1946,2020-04-29 14:38:59,gaacdr,I don‚Äôt mean to minimize anyone‚Äôs concern.  But the ‚Äòcool drinking‚Äô culture is something I really try to ignore.  I‚Äôve had to work at it!
1947,2020-04-29 14:43:53,gaacdr,"I guess it simply reflects that ""being a celebrity"" doesn't confer wisdom, knowledge, intelligence or sensitivity.

I believe that our culture has conveyed significantly skewed importance to ""entertainment"".  

There was a time when ""being famous"" was a result of creating something, contributing to the betterment of humanity....   examples like inventing a polio vaccine, creating light bulbs, performing open-heart surgery, saving lives, changing the learning of children and shaping them for a productive future.....

Instead, my observation is that our society values someone who can make me laugh, throw a ball farther than someone else or use the most F*%$ in a sentence.....

By the way, I am aware that I am biased."
1948,2020-04-29 14:30:48,gaacdr,"Yeah it‚Äôs strange. Binging tv at the moment and holy crap is there so much drinking. Even in my cooking shows, when did they all start making cocktails on those?!? It‚Äôs like a rule that they make a cocktail now."
1949,2020-04-29 14:36:24,gaacdr,"I‚Äôve noticed that too, even on things like magazine covers.  I don‚Äôt take it too personally and when I have I‚Äôve tended to blow it off.  I‚Äôm happier sober and that‚Äôs all that matters.  But for sure, celebrities and memes can really glamorize something and make it look like so much fun.  And maybe it is for so many people.  It‚Äôs what makes us different and I‚Äôm ok with that"
1950,2020-04-29 15:09:59,gaacdr,I don't give a rip about celebs.  The vast majority of them are uneducated.  I prefer that they stick to acting and keep their political opinions and their drinking habits to themselves.  No class. IwNdWYT
1951,2020-04-29 15:14:34,gaacdr,Stops me cold for a split second every time I hear someone mention booze as the perfect quarantine fix. Thank you for speaking out. IWNDWYT.
1952,2020-04-29 16:41:54,gaacdr,"I just equate not having anything to do but drink as an inability to form a real personality.  Most of these celebrities may be nice people, but they're also probably so use to being cottled that they don't know what to do alone."
1953,2020-04-29 18:36:52,gaacdr,"Before I get upset and offended by things like that, I try to step back and ask myself. 'Am I the intended audience for this?' For me, it really helps not to get hurt by things that not only aren't intended to hurt me, but really weren't intended for me at all.

Here's an example. I struggle with depression. Once upon a time I would get mad at facebook posts saying things like, 'truly happy people count their blessings regardless of circumstance'. At first, those made me so mad. Like, what the hell? That's not going to change my brain chemistry! Then I realized. Messages like that are designed for people who don't struggle with depression, but maybe just need a reminder to be grateful and have a positive outlook.

Celebrities sharing cocktail recipes or posting pictures of drinks online fall in the same category. I'm just not their audience. They aren't making cocktails for people who are unable to stop until they are blind drunk or otherwise in a bad way. They're making cocktails for normies. 

Then I step away and let the celebs and the normies enjoy themselves without my judgment."
1954,2020-05-03 20:11:55,gaacdr,"social media in general; from the mommy-needs-her-mommy-juice thing..to.. ""man as soon as this is over we're gonna PARTY at happy hour!""..to.. ""oh man my liver sure is gonna take a beating in this deal"" etc.. it's all designed as cutesy-pie, but it's really quite pathetic.. and lying propaganda really.. the stupid collective agreement that *alcohol is our friend*. I have one FB friend and EVERY post is about alcohol and how wonderful it is right now during this thing etc.. she's nauseating. I don't like drunks, even when (and ESPECIALLY when) I'm one of'm. a crisis needs heroes.. drunks can't be heroic"
1955,2020-04-29 15:54:27,gaacdr,Most people don't have a drink problem.

1957,2020-04-29 15:31:04,gaacdr,Agreed.
1958,2020-04-29 15:31:54,gaacdr,"Right? It's nuts. It's not a fix, if anything it's definitely creating a bigger problem for some people"
1959,2020-04-30 06:52:13,gaacdr,"if they keep up the day drinking they will eventually. Nobody is immune from alcoholism and I think the promotion of this kind of thing is irresponsible. 

(It‚Äôs hard to imagine celebrities chain-smoking their way through lockdown in tv and everyone laughing about it etc)

Yah, I‚Äôve had the ‚ÄúEllen‚Äù show on and it does bug me that the show features so much daytime drinking."

1963,2020-04-28 22:42:52,g9wgeq,"I still laugh just THINKING about the scene where Prymatt's water breaks.

But a little sad thinking about Farley & Hartman"
1964,2020-04-28 22:50:52,g9wgeq,I consume mass quantities on a regular basis. Very few folks get the reference.
1965,2020-04-28 23:02:19,g9wgeq,I love this movie. It‚Äôs actually dead on in describing the immigrant experience even if the aliens are from a bit far away!
1966,2020-04-28 22:32:53,g9wgeq,[Starz](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/coneheads)
1967,2020-04-28 20:55:03,g9uwes,"Keep in mind that none of these are really that popular. Colbert gets between 2-3 million viewers a night and Fallon and Kimmel get between 1-2 million each. The later hosts like Corden get even less. The cable hosts like Conan and Noah barely crack half a million if they're lucky. Bottom line is that on any given night the vast majority of Americans are not watching late night talk shows.

In daytime you can get some bigger numbers. Judge Judy regularly gets 10 million. Dr. Phil will get 5 million. Ellen and Kelly are down around 3 million."
1968,2020-04-28 20:42:44,g9uwes,"Based on TV show ratings, the most popular late night talk show host is Stephen Colbert."
1969,2020-04-28 20:41:56,g9uwes,"I'm no fan of Corden. He seems to me like he was picked entirely because Ferguson was British (Scottish, English, same thing, right?) and he's largely inoffensive. I think Colbert is the most liked, if only because of left over good will from the Colbert Report. Jimmy Fallon oscillates between tolerated and hated. He got a lot of crap for his interview with the President. Jimmy Kimmel is kind of an asshole, but he seems well liked here. Nobody really watches Meyers, and Trever Noah is largely overshadowed by Jon Stewart, so it's hard to judge him.

And as for the hate toward Ellen DeGeneres, I can't comment. Reddit is a strange place filled with people who get filled with righteous indignation at the most pointless of shit."
1970,2020-04-28 20:39:29,g9uwes,"We claim John Oliver. He‚Äôs the one I like the most. Still like Colbert. Kimmel is tolerable. Rest can go fuck themselves, especially Ellen and James Corden. I probably hate Fallon less than most since I thought he was funny in his SNL days, but I don‚Äôt watch his stuff ever."
1971,2020-04-28 21:22:18,g9uwes,"People don't watch these shows that much, but the general public is probably most familiar with Oprah, Ellen DeGeneres, Jimmy Kimmel, and Jimmy Fallon. Oprah's show isn't on anymore but she's still kinda the big face of talk shows. Ten to fifteen years ago, David Letterman and Jay Leno were very popular, but their shows aren't on anymore and I don't hear much about them now. 

James Corden only got big because people liked Carpool Karaoke, he's not really that popular. Seth Meyers probably got a bigger audience on SNL than on his show. Conan O'Brien was bigger with his last show than he is now. Then there's Stephen Colbert, Trevor Noah, and John Oliver who appeal to kinda a different demographic, more niche and intellectual I'd say."
1972,2020-04-28 21:08:17,g9uwes,Colbert is tops
1973,2020-04-28 20:52:01,g9uwes,"Other than a local long running radio morning show, I'm not a fan of talk shows."
1974,2020-04-28 21:24:48,g9uwes,"I‚Äôll be honest I‚Äôm not a fan of any of them... Letterman was good and then Ferguson was the last good one that left late night.

Edit: I think Ferguson left before Letterman...Yep Ferguson was April of 14, Letterman May of 15"
1975,2020-04-28 21:27:16,g9uwes,"Colbert is definitely winning late night rn. He gets 3.5 million viewers a night and everyone else is below 2 million. For daytime talk shows (which is typically watched by older people who stay at home), Ellen dominates with more than 4 million viewers a day.

I personally prefer Myers."
1976,2020-04-28 21:30:16,g9uwes,"Jimmy Kimmel is the most popular one amongst people I know.  Can I ask what you gus hate about Corden?  He seems pretty straight-forwardly inoffensive.  I mean, he's not God's gift to comedy or anything but neither are most other people in his position.  Is there something he did or said or something?"
1977,2020-04-28 23:35:42,g9uwes,"I'm not really a fan of the talkshow format. Conan is the only one I like. He seems like a genuinely good guy. I dont watch his show much, but listen to his podcast, watch some clips on youtube and I like is ""remotes"" where he visits other countries. He seems a little less political than all the others, which I like. The other talk show hosts I cant stand. They all seem so fake and give off a ""only in it for the money"" type of vibe to me."
1978,2020-04-29 00:35:22,g9uwes,Daytime TV has a much wider audience and can be shown in waiting rooms and lobbies around the country. So it has to please a much wider audience than primetime evening slots. The demo for Ellen is not really represented on Reddit.
1979,2020-04-29 02:39:07,g9uwes,Honestly... the only people make sure to watch regularly are Rhett and Link
1980,2020-04-29 03:07:35,g9uwes,"Most Americans dont like any of them all that much.

Colbert is decent in my book. Meyers is decent. 

 Fallon probably gets the biggest stars."
1981,2020-04-29 06:33:01,g9uwes,"They're all bad except sometimes Conan and Colbert. Old Colbert was actually very good when he had a CC show so I know he certainly can be funny, he had solid satire but he's far lazier now.  

I think Colbert is technically the most popular."
1982,2020-04-29 10:10:37,g9uwes,"Fallon, Kimmel and Ellen are the big three in terms of notoriety these days. Although, Colbert and Trever Noah tend to be much higher rated than those."
1983,2020-04-28 20:43:04,g9uwes,Ellen and Fallon are the only ones I like.
1984,2020-04-29 02:37:35,g9uwes,"The ratings of the ""in the background"" mid-day TV programs are surprisingly incredible."
1985,2020-04-29 04:27:01,g9uwes,I find it absurd still that Fallons youtube took down the video of him interviewing Trump cause of a mob that demanded it. It was an actual pretty good interview
1986,2020-04-28 20:43:34,g9uwes,Oliver is a gem
1987,2020-04-28 20:50:29,g9uwes,"I'm not a fan of Oliver. I do like when he does exposes of major scams like MLMs. But when he tries to make a political point, he loves to find the absolute most extreme often isolated example of the opposite as a counterargument, and then tends to oversimplify everything with something along the lines of ""see? they are bad"" implying anything that's not what he presented is the same as that  example."
1988,2020-04-29 00:01:19,g9uwes,John Oliver is literally trash
1989,2020-04-28 22:36:14,g9uwes,"I don‚Äôt watch any talk shows, but I am a fan of carpool karaoke."
1990,2020-04-28 21:48:14,g9uwes,"He has a reputation in the UK for being an asshole. I don't so much mean from his work just stories that have circulated about how he is with fans (including an infamous one about how he treated his wife). Of course there's no proof they are real but there's been too many members of the public commenting on their experience of him to shrug off.

Do have a read of his [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/bqy5zf/i_am_james_corden_alongside_ben_winston_and_five/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). It's quite something."
1991,2020-04-29 07:42:30,g9uwes,"Yeah, but he was too nice to Trump, so everybody got all mad at him. Clearly treating a political candidate with the same respect he'd treat every other guest was wrong."
1992,2020-04-28 22:21:26,g9uwes,He‚Äôs a huge fan of ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù arguments and is very smarmy in my opinion.
1993,2020-04-28 21:56:29,g9uwes,"interesting, I'll check that out"

1995,2020-04-28 17:32:56,g9qol7,"There is no such thing as laughing too hard my friend. My wife loves stand up. I prefer comedy movies. 

Brian Regan is really funny. My in-laws have seen him many times together as a family. 

The wife and I are currently rewatching the office, though we are taking a break from that to watch Seinfeld start to finish."
1996,2020-04-28 18:51:07,g9qol7,Where are you watching Seinfeld is it on Netflix? I never really got into the series I was young when it was popular I think I would appreciate it now.
1997,2020-04-28 18:53:11,g9qol7,It‚Äôs on Hulu. It‚Äôs defiantly dated now. A lot of the gags wouldn‚Äôt work in a world with cell phones. But the slapstick and interpersonal comedy is still funny.

OBVIOUSLY they are privileged but that‚Äôs no surprise. Also many celebs do what they can with their influence to help (though not all).

2098,2020-06-20 16:13:30,hca7fk,Oh i did. You're just the special kind of stupid that believes it. So if the CIA wanted Hilirary in the white house why didn't she win? Must of been the lizard prople. Also stack sats
2099,2020-06-21 05:17:36,hca7fk,"Sorry for calling you stupid. Doesn't solve anything. I apologize. Been staying up way to late and drinking to much. 
So now I'll explain. The CIA doesn't care whether you're Democrat or Republican. They don't care if you drink coke or pepsi. They don't care if you wear nike or Reebok. 

They are too busy making sure some wakos don't destroy us from the inside. 

Yes the tv is used to control you. But the people in charge are not the CIA. Its the same people behind everything. And it's not a conspiracy theory. 

You can call them the Silicon 6 but it's basically every billionaire on the planet. 

TV has always been for you to consume and buy products. We are told what to buy and you are constantly bombarded by it.

This whole movement people are realizing it's not a black and white thing.

Everyone is being held down by the elite class that don't give a fuck about anyone. 

The system is rigged against us to succeed. 

That's why we love bitcoin.

This system will fail eventually and it's kinda scary. Hopefully Bitcoin is the future. 

But then again we might just go back to the stoneage.

Everything is meant to distract you. But it's right in front of our face. We are being suppressed by the rich yet we keep getting distracted by something else. 

Take care friend. Sorry again"

2178,2020-06-19 19:09:38,hbts4d,Was getting crazy range of numbers for average income in 1969 so I went with minimum wage for ease. May have been as low as 36% of median household income. So half of what they cost today.
2179,2020-06-19 17:03:00,hbts4d,Yeah it‚Äôs just this comment chain come from a comment about how unaffordable ALL cars are. The average American can‚Äôt afford the price of the average car and that‚Äôs why no one saves for retirement and they get 7 year car loans.
2180,2020-06-21 17:25:09,hbts4d,Which changed at a higher rate? Income or car price?
2181,2020-06-19 17:06:20,hbts4d,"I agree, wage stagflation and inflation in general have made cars stupid expensive versus income. Ratio has changed quite a bit since 80's/90's...though a lot of new cars now will easily last 15-20 years with proper maintenance, so a 7 year note isn't too bad if you don't constantly crave a new car."
2182,2020-06-21 05:44:16,hbts4d,"Our consumer culture makes people want the new cars. I daily drive a 2001 Ford F150 for my shtity commute. 2 hours a day. That truck is quiet, comfortable, reliable, and probably worth $3500. There are shitloads of used cars in this country. The amount of car you can get for $5,000 is incredible."
2183,2020-06-19 23:02:01,hbts4d,"Remember when Obama incentivized destroying hundreds of thousands of mostly good used cars? Definitely fucked the market for the lower class (like me, at the time)."
2184,2020-06-19 23:04:26,hbts4d,I don't recall that. What was the reasoning? Were they cars that got poor mpg or something?
2185,2020-06-19 23:29:03,hbts4d,"Cash for Clunkers. They were supposed to be low mpg, but the actual result was barely a difference between the used and new.

The Wikipedia on it is pretty comprehensive... and depressing."
2186,2020-06-19 23:32:20,hbts4d,"Dang that sucks. I'll check it out. Seems like the vehicles could have been donated to lower income individuals or charities/churches, etc."
2187,2020-06-19 23:57:48,hbts4d,"Saving the planet, supposedly. Probably more realistically a big blowjob from Congress to auto makers and dealers. Typical political nonsense. It just happened to really bone me because the prices in the used market went way up right when I needed a cheap car."
2188,2020-06-20 23:48:55,hbts4d,"once the self driving cars are unleashed to the general public, the used car market will increase and also tank. High end cars will be worth a hair above their value in scrap metal."

2190,2020-06-19 03:24:47,hbt4hq,I guess off camera she is not a nice person. That is what i heard anyway.
2191,2020-06-19 03:29:55,hbt4hq,She‚Äôs rude and makes her guests feel uncomfortable for the show
2192,2020-06-19 03:29:20,hbt4hq,"I always hated her after she did that bait show where she baited fans to essentially steal extra little trinkets she had let them take, it was a take one deal but people were taking more than one and she publically, on her national, show called them out. I found it hilarious but also made her look like an absolute CUNT. Lol, still love her as Dory though!"

Although i didn't see the run forest shirt until your posting but what confused me is the ""AAAAA"" screaming down the arms. 

That face i don't think is about Tom Hanks. It resembles more of this image to me because of the teeth. This photo was ALL over google in 2017 and 2018 but now it's no where.

The rabbit hole goes deep.. Are you aware of Mouthy Buddha and Pedogate?"
2195,2020-06-19 06:14:04,hbr08u,They are wannabes if Jean Michel Basquiat. Jay Z is opsessed with Jean Michel and tries now to look like him with the hair and everything. He also tried to crossover into the fine art world by doing a video with Marina Abromovich who is a huge artist. So the sweatshirt and the drawing are definitely actual Basquiat gear. Lady Gaga is actually an art student. Ellen just probably is trying to be cool by being able to buy all that shit or she probably actually knew the guy. Either way nothing really odd here.
2196,2020-06-19 12:11:19,hbr08u,"You lost me as soon as you said the dems owned the media.

The media is controlled by corporate capitalists. D and R is simply used to keep the working classes divided."
2197,2020-06-19 02:02:35,hbr08u,"If she is involved, she is too known to be a major part of the game she's most likely a pawn. Adrenochrome is not known by that name in the older times but, cannibalistic tribes always mention that when the shaman eats human flesh, the shaman has visions. So Adrenochrome is something real, but idk about Ellen, dont underestimate these people, they have a lot of power and intellect, if they were that dumb they wouldn't be getting away with it, whatever she has shown or has been exposed has most likely been done on purpose."

2213,2020-06-19 23:38:13,hbr08u,A lot are in private collections such as Ellen‚Äôs
2214,2020-08-12 02:03:59,hbr08u,I‚Äôm curious what you feel about all this today?
2215,2020-08-12 02:20:41,hbr08u,"Well. Personally it's all fucked. 
Everything from Epstein's Flight Logs all the way to Marina Abramovic's Spirit Cooking. 

I'm well informed on the thousands of connections between Hollywood, Politics and Pedophilia. 

A lot of evidence that I have found puts me in the mindset of ""I would rather be wrong and believe all of these disgusting ""theories"" (as the mass would say) then to be ignorant and not questioning the things going on in the world while they continue to go on. 

I feel like im in a weird spot, and i know im not alone; I was a Democrat, hated trump, loved Obama, Hillary, the whole democratic party. But realizing what's going on behind the scenes I'm starting to make a very dramatic shift. 

I'm starting to notice things that Trump is doing like those Executive Orders he signed about U.S medicine. All the money he's donated to help prevent Human Trafficking. I now understand what he means by ""Drain the swamp"" but because of my previous views on Trump, i can't help but to think he's in on it too. 

I know that numerous republicans are also tied into these rings and act of absolutely atrocities along with their opposing parties. I know Trump has a record of the same type of things but he's only been recorded going to Epstein's Island once. 

I don't know where i stand. All I know is we have got to do our best to Save our children of the world. I haven't even done a dent of research into other countries and how bad it is there. Oh and another thing i know... i would much rather have Trump than Biden as president."

2217,2020-06-17 13:56:50,haritn,"Cultural appropriation might be annoying but it's more abstract of an idea than straight up sexual assault or racist commentary - if a person has a history of saying racist stuff, it's hard to deny that. If a person wears a certain style of clothing, well, that's not a crime, just might be annoying to the eyes.

The thing with DeGeneres is, based on what I observed personally, there wasn't enough evidence of her behavior (from what I saw, it was hard to determine who was an actual employee with real experience and who was just hopping on the Twitter bandwagon to post a shocking story). And while she is allegedly toxic as hell, it doesn't sound like she committed any outright racist or sexist action, which is what cancel culture tends to focus on."

I liked how they explored the origins of Dory, and how she got separated from her family. Unlike Cars 2, this film uses the comic relief character and actually give her more of a personality. We felt sad knowing she lost her parents but felt happy that she found them again. It also has a very positive message for people with disabilities."

Happy that ROTK won, didn‚Äôt expect TDK 2nd and Brokeback last. I got all the acting categories right but I didn‚Äôt think ROTK would win *so many* technical categories."
2234,2020-06-17 14:08:12,hadlq6,"Wow, Serkis gets #1 and #2! That‚Äôs a perfect opportunity for a split vote, but he really was just that good!"
2235,2020-06-17 02:12:46,hadlq6,Huh?!
2236,2020-06-17 17:00:19,hadlq6,Wait...... Memento is adapted though.
2237,2020-06-17 11:10:19,hadlq6,"Jesus stop with the stupid spirited away. Havent seen a more boring animated movie in my whole life. This is movie industry not some art gallery, just because you like the art style doesnt make the movie best animated movie ever. What a lame story it has and you must have really low standards to like that plot."
2238,2020-06-17 17:03:07,hadlq6,"More disappointed that The Dark Knight's ""loud noises"" score beat out Harry Potter, Spider-Man, and even Pirates of the Caribbean (Zimmer's best score by far). TDK gets the job done but isn't anything special, while those others are all-time bests."
2239,2020-06-17 12:59:38,hadlq6,"Yeah.  Fellowship should have been the sole nominee in a few of those categories, and replaced RotK in a couple more.  It's been almost twenty years, time for people to stop lumping them all under RotK.  Fellowship is the best of the three, mainly because it is more subtle and doesn't suffer from the bloat that starts creeping in."
2240,2020-06-16 22:47:17,hadlq6,And Brokeback Mountain in last place. This is exactly why I‚Äôm glad people don‚Äôt vote on the Oscars
2241,2020-06-17 05:40:56,hadlq6,"‚ÄúI expected better from this sub‚Äù. You do now art is subjective and your opinion is not a higher level, right?"
2242,2020-06-17 13:00:28,hadlq6,After TDK swept its year I'm surprised it didn't win the whole thing.
2243,2020-06-17 03:07:18,hadlq6,Agreed. Pretty disappointed with this sub.
2244,2020-06-17 02:49:02,hadlq6,I mean Memento is from Nolan and is an extremely well edited movie but I also voted for Eternal Sunshine in that category.
2245,2020-06-17 02:36:14,hadlq6,?
2246,2020-06-17 17:09:57,hadlq6,"Not according to the Academy which nominated it under Best Original Screenplay as well, it was released before Jonathan Nolan‚Äôs short story was published so I guess that‚Äôs the reasoning. Moonlight is similar but that was put in Best Adapted Screenplay so the Academy is pretty inconsistent with that. Memento got more votes for original during the 2001 nominations so I put it there but it‚Äôs one of the weird screenplays that could be put in either imo."
2247,2020-06-17 14:09:56,hadlq6,"I love how some people have become super snooty about the results of these Reddit chosen Oscar's when a great deal of the time the choices match up with what the Academy chose. 4 Best Picture winners (Chicago, Return of the King, The Departed and No Country for Old Men) match up so far, and it's hard to complain about the others (Requiem for a Dream, Spirited Away, Eternal Sunshine, Brokeback Mountain, The Dark Knight, Inglourious Basterds - all are better or on par with the actual winners of that year). Just because there's a *little* less traditional Oscar Bait and a few more crowdpleasing blockbusters doesn't mean this is some peasant show."
2248,2020-06-17 06:27:05,hadlq6,"Please shut up, I never said that and ""expected better"" is a common phrase"
2249,2020-06-17 02:52:14,hadlq6,"True, Memento does have the Nolan factor."
2250,2020-06-17 02:38:15,hadlq6,Aw nah im just surprised by the results
2251,2020-06-18 04:35:11,hadlq6,"Good response. I just noticed it now and went ""Wait a minute...""

It's weird because it's actually a valid distinction, but there's quite a lot that lands somewhere in between. Although the Whiplash one is silly to me, since it's obvious that the short was adapted from the unproduced feature script, not the other way around. Toy Story 3 is another weird one (are all sequels adaptations?). Or honestly, any script based on a true story without a single source material (like The Farewell) - I'd argue these are adapted, but they're generally classified as original."
2252,2020-06-17 18:27:04,hadlq6,"Exactly this, it‚Äôs a cringe hate tbh"
2253,2020-06-17 02:42:59,hadlq6,"Ah ok, I thought you were asking about something or something like that"
2254,2020-06-18 05:13:11,hadlq6,All sequels are counted as adaptations since they‚Äôre adapting characters from a previous story.
2255,2020-06-16 23:45:49,hadld2,This is a pretty generic list.

2258,2020-06-16 22:50:03,hadld2,"LOTR fans, I saved you ;)   


Hadn't seen all of the films mentioned, but out of what I saw I voted Inglourious Basterds over Dark Knight.  I could've been the one vote :P"
2259,2020-06-17 02:46:48,hadld2,Shaun of the Dead isn't a debut
2260,2020-06-17 14:08:23,hadld2,"Wow, Serkis gets #1 and #2! That‚Äôs a perfect opportunity for a split vote, but he really was just that good!"

2263,2020-06-17 10:43:35,hadld2,"The most interesting choice here is Rachel McAdams for Mean Girls (which I don't really get, but fine). I'm interested how many of the films are not in the Reddit Top 250."
2264,2020-06-17 10:47:05,hadld2,Could we have male and female international roles for the next decade? I think everyone watched more international films in the 2010s. By 2020 I'd struggle choosing just 5.
2265,2020-06-17 05:59:10,hadld2,"i did the same with IB at 1. while Dark Knight would not of been my second place film, it would be over LOTR"
2266,2020-06-17 03:00:47,hadld2,Did Fistful of Fingers ever have a proper release? From what I can tell it only initially screened once so I think it‚Äôs a bit unfair to consider it his theatrical debut which is really what directorial debut refers to in this context.
2267,2020-06-17 15:28:43,hadld2,"It won Best Original Score, it was close to getting in a lot of other categories but just missed out."
2268,2020-06-17 15:30:43,hadld2,"Films not in the most recent r/movies Top 250 (main categories only):

* American Psycho
* Atonement
* Brokeback Mountain
* Capote
* Chicago
* Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
* Mean Girls
* Monster
* The Aviator

This is the deviation of r/oscarrace, ladies and gentlemen."
2269,2020-06-17 15:27:06,hadld2,I was thinking about doing that for both international roles and voice acting/mocap roles. I was going to do a poll that I would ask if people would want to see that but I‚Äôm sure that would turn out to being a yes so yeah I‚Äôll add both and if there is a year where they don‚Äôt receive that many votes I‚Äôll either merge them or do three nominees in each.
2270,2020-06-17 03:08:31,hadld2,Ah I assumed directoral debut meant the first feature length movie that was directed.
2271,2020-06-17 16:09:05,hadld2,That's fair. What are your observations for the 2000s? Were there enough votes that warranted 5 nominees per gender?
2272,2020-06-17 03:13:09,hadld2,"I would think of it like Taylor Sheridan. He was the credited director of Vile in 2012, though according to an interview he says didn‚Äôt do much on the project, but he was still nominated by the DGA for Outstanding Work by a First Time Director for Wind River in 2017."
2273,2020-06-17 16:15:48,hadld2,"In some years, most notably 2006 which probably had the most international movies that people have seen of the decade. Most of the time there wouldn‚Äôt be but since more people probably started seeing more international films in the 2010s I think it should be a good change."
2274,2020-06-17 03:34:14,hadld2,"I'm not sure the situations are comparable since, while Vile was more Sherdian saving a friend's ass than a legitimate creative venture, Fistful of Fingers was Wright doing a larger budget version of his own student film with him both writing and directing.

 I mean, it's your set up that you're doing a ton of work for so qualify however you see best, but I still don't see Shaun as a proper debut."
2275,2020-06-17 03:51:09,hadld2,"The situations behind Fistful of Fingers and Vile are definitely different but their close enough to compare imo. I personally didn‚Äôt nominate or vote for Shaun of the Dead in any of the rounds but since it was by the most popular option in all the rounds of voting it competed in and because I couldn‚Äôt find any info Fistful of Fingers having a proper release I thought it was only fair to count it, if that makes sense."

2352,2020-06-16 00:19:21,h9lods,"I finished the show again last night and I had the same question run through my head. 

I think Carlton has the drive to become whatever he wants to be so I have no doubt that he would‚Äôve become a successful lawyer. 

Hilary at the time was extremely successful so I imagine her show would have been a hit for at least 5 years. Possibly longer. I feel like by 2020 her show would have finished up though and she‚Äôd move on to something else in the industry. 

Ashley could‚Äôve gone either way. We don‚Äôt know if how she would have gone in the performing arts school. My gut tells me she would be the kind of actor that got a few side roles but wouldn‚Äôt become a Hollywood Star. Along with her singing fame, she might have become one of those celebrities that appears on celebrity reality shows and what not. 

Uncle Phil and Aunt Viv would have retired comfortably on the east coast, still keeping their family values and doing what they could to support their kids. 

Geoffrey I imagine would have spent a lot of time making up for the lost years with Frederick. Owning a quaint house in England, living a humble life and hopefully enjoying his grandkids. 

As for Will, this is the biggest unknown. We don‚Äôt know what career he was interested in. Unless he landed an extremely good job and/or found himself a great girl in LA, I feel like he would move to the east coast. He has no one in LA but Jazz. LA is an empty place for him since the family left. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd move back to Philly because he‚Äôs accustomed to the big city life, so I think he would go to NY. Close with the family and a couple hours from his mother. As for a job, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd go back to the Hilary show. He‚Äôs got too much potential and charisma to be in the production team forever, unless he was in a supporting role in front of the camera like the DJ on Ellen where he can make a name for himself. 
I always wonder where will would have ended up but this is my best guess."
2353,2020-06-15 18:45:22,h9lods,I'm watching the whole show again just now as well. I'm midway through the 1st season. I'm not really sure how it would have worked out for everyone but I also ponder the possibilities. The last episode never fails to hit me right in the feels though. What a show.
2354,2020-06-16 04:25:43,h9lods,"I like your thoughts, especially for Ashley. She never seemed like someone who could really get those leading roles on her own, everything she got was kind of handed to her through Wills work and connections (except the modeling). You're right she probably could do reality TV or maybe join a singing girl group like a Fifth Harmony or something since she's a one hit wonder."

2439,2020-06-28 23:13:27,hhj0td,"""Through denying their feelings of fear to one extent or another, Sexual Sixes go against danger from a position of strength; therefore, they have a passion for searching for or securing a position of strength. And it's not just a strong character they seek, but the kind of strength that makes somebody else afraid-they want to assume a powerful enough to hold the enemy at a distance. These Sixes display a forcefulness that comes from no wanting to be weak, and they don't allow for weakness in themselves....""

"".....Sexual Sixes have a need not just for strength but for intimidation. As Naranjo suggests, this expression of intimidation is very much the essence of the character; if they appear strong, they won't be attacked. ....""

"".....Sexual Sixes give off the impression that they could get violent with anybody at any time, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that they have no fear. It is precisely out of a sense of fear that their anticipation of an attack comes-there is a somewhat paranoid imagining of danger, a belief that anyone can turn into a threat. However, these Sixes usually do not look afraid; their visible character could hardly be called ""fearful"" from the outside.

In contrast to the Self-Preservation Six, who backs away from threats, the couterphobic Sexual Six tends to move toward risky situations, feeling a sense of safety in actually confronting danger rather than hiding from it or avoiding it. They convince themselves (and others) that they are not victims of fear; they are convinced that fear is an emotion that should be eliminated systemically.....""

"".....The fact that these Sixes regularly move against danger (or perceived danger) can, at times, give them the appearance of a rebel, a daredevil, a risk taker, an adrenaline junkie, or a troublemaker. In some cases, Sexual Sixes may be prone to megalomania or having a ""hero complex."" In their own way, they seek to be ""good guys"" to avoid being punished. They may have the illusion that they are spontaneous, but they tend not to be.

Sexual Sixes tend to be very contrarian: they always have an argument at hand to refute and contradict an opinion. Instead of thinking in terms of ""best-case"" or ""worst-case"" scenarios, they think in terms of contrarian scenarios-if the trend is for others to focus on the worst, they will focus on the best; but if everyone is focusing on the best, they will assert the worst.....""

2444,2020-06-30 16:52:15,hhj0td,"yeah what you explained is what i think is the 1 in her tritype, which is her secondary type. what makes me believes she is a 3 is her worst fear when it came to the boggart was a failed test. to me, that just screams 3 bc hermione is way more focused on achievements, ‚Äúwe could have been killed, or worse, expelled‚Äù (i know it‚Äôs the exact right line, but you get the point). She also used the time turner to take more classes, which to me screams 3. She also breaks the rules a lot. i know it‚Äôs for the greater good a lot, but she breaks so many rules that a 1 would have a heart attack. That‚Äôs why I think she‚Äôs a 3 and not a 1. My sister is a sp 3w4, and we thought for a while she was a 1, and she is almost identical to hermione. That‚Äôs my two cents. Have a good day!"

Will Hunting is a counterphobic 6, you can see the difference between the two. Everything Will does is fear based, even when he gets unruly and abrasive. He fears getting hurt (his trauma definitely plays into that, and there's nothing to suggest that enneagram type isn't born from trauma)."

By the way, there was absolutely no basis for this theory outside a couple weird videos this creepy little narcissistic woman made, along with some screenshots of a supposed ankle bracelet which couldn't actually be visually confirmed.

>The idea does not necessarily imply that there is no objective truth; rather that our access to it is mediated through our senses, experience, conditioning, prior beliefs, and other non-objective factors. The implied individual world each person occupies is said to be their reality tunnel. The term can also apply to groups of people united by beliefs: we can speak of the fundamentalist Christian reality tunnel or the ontological naturalist reality tunnel.

>A parallel can be seen in the psychological concept of confirmation bias‚Äîthe human tendency to notice and assign significance to observations that confirm existing beliefs, while filtering out or rationalizing away observations that do not fit with prior beliefs and expectations. This helps to explain why reality tunnels are usually transparent to their inhabitants. While it seems most people take their beliefs to correspond to the ""one true objective reality"", Robert Anton Wilson emphasizes that each person's reality tunnel is their own artistic creation, whether they realize it or not.

Please see my link to the warrant and charges that I've outlined from the prosecutor's office in...""  ""Also see the statement where the prosecutor put forth that the above charge has been filed.""

It's considered fallacious reasoning (faulty/unfair/specious) to ask somebody to prove that something is NOT true like ""It's not true that Ellen is under house arrest"" especially when that person didn't make the initial claim and is not responding to a well-substantiated argument.

A photo of what you assume to be an ankle monitor isn't substantial proof for any reasonable person to have to refute.

What you call ""the conspiracy"" is actually a circular reasoning fallacy.   Like ""I can't provide proof that Ellen is on the sex offender registry because she is above the law.""  You are not providing evidence of her guilt, but simply circling back to the original premise that ""powerful people are guilty of being sex offenders because powerful people are sex offenders.""  What's more she is not above the law enough to be on house arrest but above the law enough to avoid the sex offender register.  Make sense? No, it doesn't at all."

2698,2020-06-28 03:03:15,hh2snv,I'm sure that kind of evil exists within powerful circles but I doubt the ramblings from 4chan are going to shine an accurate spotlight here.
2699,2020-06-29 21:38:20,hh2snv,"Disclaimer: All of the following is dependent on the specific claims being made. There is a spectrum of claims. For example, 1) ""A pedophilia ring was operated from the basement of this particular pizza restaurant"" (highly unreasonable). 2) ""There are a number of secret pedophiles among the global elite"" (obviously true based on statistics alone). 3) ""There exists some organized pedophilia between powerful individuals used for in-group affirmation and control."" 

I consider the relevant meat of Pizzagate to be somewhere around that third claim, and here's what I think of it:

I think it's plausible. Meaning, I don't know of any logical or empirical reason why it couldn't be true. And it certainly explains a lot of observed behavior. (Again, there are specific claims that can be proven or disproven, but I'm not talking about specifics). 

However, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. While a theory may be plausible, a theory this grand and sinister requires more evidence than we have so far for me to ""believe"" it with any confidence.

For me to believe it seriously, I'd need more empirical evidence (like Jeffery Epstein turning over his secret ledger of child sex trades between rich and powerful people for favors), or substantially more behavior that makes the most sense under that explanation. Most things have many possible explanations, and most true explanations are not the one anyone thinks of. So the circumstantial evidence really has to pile up before it has any actual weight.

I could also dismiss Pizzagate entirely if it stopped making any sense at all. As long as there are things like Jeffery Epstein not killing himself, the messed up art in these people's houses, and ""handkerchief pizza maps,"" it's unlikely for the theory to have nothing on its side. But theoretically, I can envision a world where stuff like that doesn't exist, or is a lot rarer than it actually is, and there's no ""motivation"" to believe that anything like Pizzagate is real.

A few notes:

I'm comfortable leaving even extraordinary theories in the ""plausible"" category. I feel no guilt about contemplating any theory. Confidence requires higher standards, but consideration does not.

Vagueness when it comes to details and ""but you can't *disprove""* are totally unconvincing, but also don't disqualify something from the truth. Some theories, on the other hand, can be disqualified by being internally incoherent (logic) or failing to accurate predict observation in reality (empiricism).

Pizzagate is *at worst* in the ""unpersuasively non-disprovable"" zone. Which is enough for me to say maybe, and I'm totally comfortable doing so. I think the evidence is a fair ways stronger that, but not enough to be significant in terms of convincing myself or anyone else of anything concrete.

**TLDR:**

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Pizzagate is an extraordinary claim without extraordinary evidence. But unlike many other other conspiracy theories, I haven't seen anything that disqualifies it from the realm of possibility (setting aside disprovable specific claims)."
2700,2020-06-28 08:13:37,hh2snv,"Look at Jefferey Epstein. Forget any conspiracies about his death, he was arrested for sexually abusing young girls, multiple times. That's just a fact, no conspiracy there. Are there other people in positions of power who are guilty of abusing children? Statistically, almost certainly. But no, I don't think that one pizza place in DC has children in the basement or whatever."
2701,2020-06-29 03:13:36,hh2snv,"I may be mistaken, but wasn‚Äôt a person involved in running this supposed child abuse ring (I think this was James Alefantis) found to have some extremely disturbing photos on his instagram of children with their hands taped up with heavy-duty duct tape and things of that nature? Weren‚Äôt there some extremely disturbing photos of children found in the restaurant? Regardless of whether an actual child abuse ring was being run by those men, the evidence that they were obsessed with the idea of tied up children and sexual ‚Äújokes‚Äù involving children seemed pretty undeniable at the time. I don‚Äôt know of any decent person who would post a photo like that on their instagram, let alone have pictures of that nature hung up on their walls.

2704,2020-06-30 14:57:25,hh2snv," I think it's pretty silly. Why would they run a pedophile ring out of a pizza restaurant?
  My guess is that some gullible people believe it because it's physically possible this could happen. Any evidence? Nope. But lots of outrageous conspiracy theories are believed because there is a small less than one percent chance they could be true. 
 Now on to claims that powerful people are involved in pedophilia/ sex abuse. My question to no supporters: Is this really as crazy as it sounds? 
  I don't think so. People decades ago didn't believe the Catholic Church sex abuse claims. They thought it was preposterous. When we look back at this we are appalled at how naive people were.
  But it could be possible people in the future will say the same about us. 

  The Jeffrey Epstein revelations. It was revealed in leaked tapes that the Royal Family threatened ABC News about airing what they knew. In the leaked video you see Amy Robach say they had evidence many people were involved. She had details we know today three years ago. The video is from  Project Veritas but ABC didn't deny it was authentic and made up a BS excuse. 
  Is it shocking they didn't air it. Nope. We've learned how Harvey Weinstein intimidated NBC into not reporting bad information about him. Top NBC executives helped cover it up. For years we've been hearing these stories. 

 I think we need to forget about Pizzgate and focus on the story that's in front of us. That corporate media, and political elites could be covering up sexual harassment, child sex abuse etc. 
   The incidents we know about probably aren't outliers. They likely do this because usually it works out fine and they don't get caught. 

  We know about Harvey Weinstein. But how much do we not know?"

>Fact checkers debunked the idea. But weeks after the November 2016 election, Edgar M. Welch, 32, a North Carolina resident, drove six hours to Comet Ping Pong to free what he believed were enslaved children. He shot several rounds from a military-style assault rifle into a locked closet door of the pizzeria and eventually surrendered to the police. In 2017, he was sentenced to four years in prison.

First it omits the fact that the shooter shot the rounds at the only computer in the place that was keeping all of the surveilance data of the place. The computer was also in a safe compartment. Curious. 

Also the pizza place had known symbols for pedophilia in its logo. Thats why people went bananas after it was mentioned.

This is absolutely invented by the pizzagate crowd. The computer was shot in the top as well, an extremely uncommon place to keep a hard drive. Here's your scenario: ""Hey our computer contains incriminating evidence, wanna throw away that hard drive?""

Comet ping pong did not ever have 'symbols for pedophilia' in it's logo. Besta Pizza, another pizzaria nearby had a swirl in their logo, also if you've ever worked at a pizza place you can see how often the swirl comes up.

The sketch was the result of the police talking to two separate people about the ONE person they said they saw. Police sketches and our ability to recollect the exact details of a face are so shitty that they came up with 2 versions of the same man. A man between ages of 20 and 40, the Podestas were in their 60's at the time.

3106,2020-09-06 00:11:02,inbqdk,"Tony Blair. People nowadays seem to have fond memories of him, but they don't know the reality. He once turned up at our house out of the blue. At first we thought it might be part of some part of political campaigning thing, but then he just kept going on about how he had nowhere to stay and how he was very hungry, so we let him inside the house and, after some discussion, agreed that he could stay for a couple of days until he got back on his feet.

At first it was fine. Tony Blair helped out with the cleaning and didn't make much mess, but then it started getting weird. At first it was minor things, like we once saw him eat several pages from The Telegraph and another time we caught him trying to create a voodoo doll of Michael Howard. But soon it started getting completely out of hand.

One night, at around 3 AM, we heard a really loud *BANG* come from the kitchen. Thinking the fridge might have exploded, we went to investigate. When we opened the kitchen door the room was full of smoke, Tony Blair was frantically rushing around the room, sweating, and wearing an apron and oven gloves. For some reason, John Prescott, wearing a string vest and no trousers, was sat at the kitchen table drinking vodka directly from the bottle. 

""What the hell's going on, Tony?"" we asked.

""Oh!"" said Tony Blair, in that voice of his, ""I was just making a roast for the boys.""

""It's 3 in the morning Tony!"" we said, ""This is madness!""

At that point John Prescott, slammed the vodka bottle down on the table, mumbled something about buggering Margaret Thatcher and then began vomiting on himself.

""That's it Tony!"" we shouted, ""That's it! You have to leave now!""

""But, I'm just making a roast..."" said Tony Blair, then he began crying.

Gordon Brown suddenly appeared at the door, also drunk and half naked.

""Toilet's broken!"" announced Gordon Brown, then he belched loudly, ""Now where's that roast?""

The whole thing was a total nightmare. We were forced to call the police to get them all to leave. It was by far the worst thing I think Tony Blair's ever done and that's even including Iraq."

They both seemed to be playing up the awkwardness for laughs. And given that Ellen's comedy has, since the 80's, worked off a persona of being out-of-step from the other person's expectations, had someone complained this was a ""cliche Ellen"" bit, I'd have agreed. But nothing was ""exposed"" by this."

Adam had arguably the biggest podcast in the world ten years ago. Now, other podcasters are cashing in on massive live-changing deals. Most notably, his old friend Bill Simmons and one of the guys who replaced him on 'The Man Show' Joe Rogan.

Adam chases every nickel that rolls past him. I know some admire the work ethic to appear in multiple reality shows, ""write"" books, do standup, and make movies. But, most of you know how much the quality of his work has suffered as a result of burning the candle at both ends.

It's not even about his transition to making a show for conservatives. Plenty of people have profited in that world. It's that he was focusing on whatever would get him another dollar and not on making something good."

Do celebrities 'monetize' their so-called popularity by the numbers of people responding?

I get that Adam's 'team' started a Twitter campaign prior to meeting/interviewing Trump.  I also know that Adam isn't sending these Tweets because his 'norm' is a 3 to 5 word msg.

Has society devolved into a bunch of people acting like toddlers learning to go 'boom boom' in the 'toy-toy' and all standing around clapping at the successful '#2' floating in the bowl?

Has Adam become the celebrity he mocks sitting each day Tweeting in their home 'office'?

Is Adam proud of this?

A 5 mph speed limit would save millions of lives in a decade but it‚Äôs not realistic. It would hamper our society too much. Similarly you could certainly argue shutdowns do the same but even more drastically. It‚Äôs not a statement on personal freedom but rather on how far we‚Äôre willing to go to be completely safe.

Kinda why Adam really isn't a leader - most people have figured out that Adam has a selfish streak - most people won't follow someone who they think are only in it for themselves.

Adam tried to make amends in a way by 'getting off the subject' and steer it to his broken jaw and....(because there is a God)...the story got more emotional as the man had a condition that made him faint and he hit his head on the table on the way down.

Adam got close to feeling empathy and maybe began to realize that ""Sticks and Stones may break my bones but names **may**end up hurting someone.

Making a big fuss and saying she wasn't invited to Dakota Fanning's party even though she was. Was cold/rude to Nikki Tutorials off-camera. Etc.


A lot of her humor makes fun of her guests in this way, which builds up over the years and it can be uncomfortable once you see compilation videos of all these incidents lol.

Makes all generations 18-19 years is very balanced, compared to making it very short as 15-16 or less years or making it very long like 21-22+ years.

I mean it is very likely a three or four year old would not remember the political importance of these events. They may not even know who this Kennedy is until like years after he died. 1961 might have memories prior to Kennedy's death.  I am sure many 1959 and 1960 borns would not remember Kennedy's death. Many 1995-1998 dont even remember 9/11. 2015-2017 though can end up remembering a world before coronavirus 15 years from now, even though they may not know what coronavirus is.

I have seen 1945-1959 as a baby boomer definition.

I have seen 1998-2016. Never 1999-2017 though. People would prefer stating X in 1960 if 1964 or 1965 is too late, since the first three years of the 60s are the full early 60s years, just like how you said 1980 should be y as it is the first 80s year.

Even if she didn‚Äôt say anything (article says she confirmed in the ellen interview if I read right) everyone knew then and there.

3292,2020-09-01 15:17:38,ikde7g,"Forcing her to drink on air, then proclaiming they were toasting to her ""not being pregnant"". After taking a small sip she proclaims she is pregnant. What a horrible and manipulative way to do that, already a shifty thing"
3293,2020-09-01 15:06:26,ikde7g,"Ellen literally did a cameo on a show where the host tried to get her to announce that she was a lesbian on his show and it ended with her announcing her and the host hooked up. 

You‚Äôd think she‚Äôd be more sensitive to this kind of thing just from that plot line alone. Someone please tell me the name of the show though. It‚Äôs killing me."
3294,2020-09-01 08:43:40,ikde7g,"I really don't understand how no one saw any of this shit coming.

The extremely unfunny vanilla Nosferatu and her lame suburban housewife audience is basically a televised tabloid. They do lame corny shit, play stupid games, gossip and idolize celebrity culture and have so much hypocrisy and double standards on the show its ridiculous.

Here's basically some of the kind of shit she would pull:

Ellen: ""Okay audience, I want to get real with you for a moment about women. As you all know I'm a woman...(uproars of hysterical laughter)....and I think it's time we get serious for a moment (her audience quiets down and gets ""serious"")....well I think social media always portrays women as sexualized and gives a lot of young girls wrong ideas about body types. You know, in movies we always see a woman with big boobs and perfect figures and always sexualized...we need to not only demand equal pay but to stop objectifying women. We need to treat them as equals and I think that message is very important (audience clapping, cheers and hoots). That's why I'm teaming up with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_(Insert corporate sponsor here)\_\_\_\_\_\_and starting the new hashtage #stopsexualizingwomen and want to get everyone involved (audience claps). It's a really hard issue but...

NOT AS HARD AS THE ABS ON THESE STUD MUFFINS! TWITCH BRING EM OUT! \*Music cue\*   
(audience cheers as 6 male muscle models emerge from behind stage)

OH YEAH! I think these boys even awoke something in me too! (uproarious laughter)""

3295,2020-09-01 09:56:09,ikde7g,"I'm so glad Ellen backlash has happened.  She has never been funny. Or entertaining.
There is this old stat guy on Reddit, he broke down the amount of time that is used for jokes, interviews, dancing, creepy.  Basically, the dancing is filler. So much filler."
3296,2020-09-01 12:30:49,ikde7g,Love how the circle jerk for Ellen does a 180 and now everyone hates her. Spoiler alert the industry is filled with thr most depraved and degenerate people on the planet.  They sell you an image and in the background they are horrible people.
3297,2020-09-01 15:17:34,ikde7g,Random Mariah Carey thought - she was fantastic in Precious over a decade ago and seemed at that moment to have a serious acting future - what happened to that?
3298,2020-09-01 12:31:29,ikde7g,"A lot of people in here saying ‚ÄúMariah may be crazy but...‚Äù Shut up! Stop making light of her mental health, and stop implying that she deserves to be treated poorly because of it."
3299,2020-09-01 06:01:14,ikde7g,She fired nannies when her kids start to love them. Both these women are not nice people.
3300,2020-09-01 11:06:22,ikde7g,Damn all kinds of tea on Ellen now that the curtain has been pulled back
3301,2020-09-01 16:25:37,ikde7g,"That whole thing was so disgusting on Ellen and her producers‚Äô part. When you suspect that someone is pregnant but hasn‚Äôt made it public yet, you don‚Äôt ‚Äúpersuade‚Äù them in telling you by forcing them to drink alcohol. It‚Äôs immoral and unethical. If Mariah didn‚Äôt clear with Ellen and her team that she wanted to announce her pregnancy beforehand, Ellen had no right to basically force the news out of her. Mariah basically had no choice but to give in and ‚Äúcome clean‚Äù. What should have been an announcement that Mariah was ready to announce - which she clearly wasn‚Äôt - turned into a painful situation, that got ten times more painful because she lost the fetus. It was either bringing her unborn child in danger by drinking wine or giving in. It wasn‚Äôt funny. It was mean.

*Edited.*"
3302,2020-09-01 10:28:11,ikde7g,"That is such an understatement, but I also understand her not wanting to blow it up so long after the fact."
3303,2020-09-01 04:27:57,ikde7g,Ellen did dirty to her. Props to Mariah for continuing their friendship after that.
3304,2020-09-01 13:04:05,ikde7g,"No one should be forced to talk about their pregnancy with strangers or have their pregnancy outed. As the husband of a labor and delivery registered nurse/educator, I have heard so many horrific stories of women losing their babies at various points in their pregnancies and (mostly older women) making comments to them about how excited they must be or similar. It‚Äôs really opened my eyes to how invasive so many of the ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù questions/remarks women get about their pregnancies. 

‚ÄúHow far along are you?‚Äù
‚ÄúYou must be so excited?‚Äù
‚ÄúIs the father excited?‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gotten so big!‚Äù
‚ÄúAre you having twins?‚Äù

So much shit that just isn‚Äôt a strangers business."
3305,2020-09-01 12:19:34,ikde7g,If I we‚Äôre Mariah Carey I would have taken that glass of wine/alcohol and thrown it in Ellen‚Äôs face!
3306,2020-09-01 16:45:23,ikde7g,Good for you Mariah. Ellen is a real asshole.
3307,2020-09-01 18:13:59,ikde7g,I saw that interview and it was cringe for a couple of reasons.  Mainly it was Ellen pushing a glass of alcohol at Mariah egging her on to drink it to prove she isn‚Äôt pregnant that was very uncomfortable to watch. It was bullying and I totally agree with Mariah that she was put on a very difficult spot.
3308,2020-09-01 11:34:31,ikde7g,"Ellen looks like an oversized evil Elf!
There, I said it!"
3309,2020-09-01 18:02:22,ikde7g,Ellen to me has always been cunty. Ellen can and has been funny but it's becuase its bubbly cuntyness.
3310,2020-09-01 21:01:29,ikde7g,"I didn‚Äôt believe the rumors because obviously I was fan of her show. But now rewatching certain clips and even hearing people who actually worked for (the first DJ and new one), now I see it."
3311,2020-09-01 09:24:16,ikde7g,"Genuine question: Is Ellen really that much worse than your average talk show host, or is she just this summer's trending topic?  Don't watch her show, and pretty out of the loop on the hate for her (aside from the articles on people saying they hated her workplace).  But Hasan Minhaj got similar criticism recently which has made me wonder if Ellen deserves to be the target of criticism or if other competitors of hers have similar work environments"
3312,2020-09-01 13:52:17,ikde7g,"Not to draw attention away from Ellen, but with all this backlash around her at the moment isn't it about time someone dragged Wendy Williams into this, given she's an even bigger human stain?"
3313,2020-09-01 14:20:59,ikde7g,When i saw the interview my first thought was it seemed strange how something so obviously uncomfortable and arguably cruel could be laughed off and swept under the rug.
3314,2020-09-01 14:42:37,ikde7g,"And there are still famous people that defend Ellen. It seems fun on the surface like on the set, but in the back it‚Äôs Guantanamo Bay."
3315,2020-09-01 15:04:07,ikde7g,"When I watch her show occasionally, I get the feeling she can be a bit sadistic. She laughs far too hard when people are falling or potentially hurting themselves when she has her silly games. I am sitting there worried that they‚Äôre going to hurt themselves when they land. I felt this way long before all this information came out. I‚Äôve seen her be passive aggressive rude to people and for all the people that says she‚Äôs so generous, she doesn‚Äôt give any of her own money away on the show. That is all sponsors.  I hate the way she humiliates Andy all the time and she‚Äôs always having her staff do things that you can clearly see they don‚Äôt want to do but she uses her power to have them do it. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs a good person."
3316,2020-09-01 16:27:33,ikde7g,"https://youtu.be/1iygZ8j_SSs
When Sia feels uncomfortable with the reveal, Ellen basically assaults her to show her face."
3317,2020-09-01 17:03:02,ikde7g,The episode that immediately turned me off of Ellen as a person was the one where she was forcing Mario Lopez to strip.
3318,2020-09-01 19:00:01,ikde7g,"Ellen is a very particular type of mean girl, the type that when you‚Äôre with her, you sense you‚Äôre the butt of a joke, but you can‚Äôt really articulate why."
3319,2020-09-01 20:28:24,ikde7g,"Honestly. Some of thee worst interviews I have ever seen all took place on Ellen‚Äôs show and were done by her. When you don‚Äôt give a fuck about ppls feelings, you do shit like this. So cringe worthy she needs to learn to  have humility or at least how to read the room"
3320,2020-09-01 09:49:12,ikde7g,"Should‚Äôve called Ellen out on it then & there. Anyone who does this sort of behaviour should be called out on the spot for it, famous or otherwise. If someone treats you like crap, take a stand."
3321,2020-09-01 11:20:42,ikde7g,Ellen's career is over.
3322,2020-09-01 14:05:30,ikde7g,That‚Äôs some Wendy Williams type shit right there.
3323,2020-09-01 15:47:07,ikde7g,"I always noticed the discomfort of a lot of Ellen's guests, but I just assumed it was planned. Like, don't they talk about what questions are going to be asked beforehand? Then it's like, oh just pretend like you don't know Ellen is going to bring this up and it'll be funny if you act like you don't want to talk about it!

I never realized that people were seriously just uncomfortable and Ellen just kept prodding when she shouldn't have. 

Even that Dakota Johnson birthday thing on the Ellen show seemed planned to me."
3324,2020-09-01 14:19:06,ikde7g,Fuck Ellen. Fuck Wendy Williams too.
3325,2020-09-01 13:12:08,ikde7g,"Im surprised people here actually care this much. Like, a famous person turned out to be an asshole, shocking. 95% of Reddit probably doesn‚Äôt even watch her show, so I don‚Äôt really get the outrage about all this."
3326,2020-09-01 11:14:46,ikde7g,In Chinese culture it‚Äôs customary to not announce it after 3 months preggo...and it‚Äôs extremely bad luck to announce before and have a miscarriage. This would be a HUGEEEE faux pas had this been in a bizzaro Chinese alternate universe

3329,2020-09-01 13:17:36,ikde7g,Ellen is a peiceashit
3330,2020-09-01 17:29:44,ikde7g,"Anybody remember that episode of whatever that talk show was with that Kathy lee giffords bitch where she made an autistic boy cry because it was so amazing that someone wanted to be friends with him? Fuck all of those shows man, the only people that‚Äôll do a show like that is someone that‚Äôs a blatant narcissistic sociopath. 
Oh, and they composed a song about how alone this little kid was until he had a friend. It‚Äôs fuckin horrible lol https://youtu.be/1MwuJy07lQY"
3331,2020-09-01 10:30:59,ikde7g,Ellen Degenerate
3332,2020-09-01 11:18:12,ikde7g,Miss Carey last name Mariah.
3333,2020-09-01 15:57:58,ikde7g,"As someone who has always seen through her, this is all pretty sweet. Still confused how so many people are such bad judges of character. I mean people were surprised about Kevin Spacey ffs"
3334,2020-09-01 16:08:39,ikde7g,Baby didn‚Äôt want to live in a world with Ellen in it
3335,2020-09-01 16:34:14,ikde7g,"I rarely watch her stuff, but when i do she always has this look like shes judging you harshly.

When her guest does something that seem off script she always has that look. She only smile/laugh when its her turn to talk, but when its the guest turn she is either judging them or waiting for her turn to talk again"
3336,2020-09-01 17:53:43,ikde7g,I recently saw this interview. It really was disgusting watching Ellen burrow herself into this woman‚Äôs personal life.
3337,2020-09-01 18:08:02,ikde7g,Ellen degenerate strikes again
3338,2020-09-01 18:09:48,ikde7g,Fuck Ellen
3339,2020-09-01 18:29:04,ikde7g,Ellen is a dick
3340,2020-09-01 18:29:15,ikde7g,Ellen has been coming out to be more and more invasive when it comes to the privacy of her guests. Her blatant disregard for all the cues (which are mostly written across the face when someone's uncomfortable so obvious that a rock could read them) makes me wonder what got into her. Almost feels like she's entitled to private info of her guests that would stir gossip. That's low.
3341,2020-09-01 20:09:57,ikde7g,"This is the kind of thing that shows that Ellen doesn‚Äôt give a shit about others and only cares about making the audience laugh, for her satisfaction. It‚Äôs a terrible quality."
3342,2020-09-01 20:46:33,ikde7g,That video of the two of them is really cringy.
3343,2020-09-02 11:30:25,ikde7g,Yeah no shit that bitch literally gave her alcoholic to drink which basically is an answer in each self.
3344,2020-09-01 05:31:42,ikde7g,"She has so many red flags and history of being a victim of manipulation. ‚ÄúCrazy ‚Äú is what they paint the ones that attempt to break free. I‚Äôm not a fan of her music, and don‚Äôt discount her true talent, just sayin‚Äô."
3345,2020-09-01 10:28:25,ikde7g,"What ya expect, everyone is fake on tv. It‚Äôs for the money, just like big girls on IG, with all them head shots with the filter and makeup."
3346,2020-09-01 14:39:29,ikde7g,So the bitch tries to force a woman she suspects as pregnant to drink alcohol to make a joke. And to out something so private. I am so done with Ellen.
3347,2020-09-01 21:53:52,ikde7g,"That story was my big red flag about Ellen ,the whole thing felt very mean to me"
3348,2020-09-01 19:01:30,ikde7g,"Man someone on the internet really really doesn‚Äôt like Ellen. We have a pandemic and the worst racial violence in 50 years and every week we have a new story about how Ellen was a meanie to someone. It‚Äôs getting bizarre. It‚Äôs always something like ‚Äòshe outed my pregnancy on her talk show‚Äô or  ‚Äòshe didn‚Äôt shake my hand‚Äô and yet we keep hearing about it. Who really gives a shit? Watch the show, don‚Äôt watch the show, if she didn‚Äôt do anything illegal or even cancel worthy already and this is the worst stuff she‚Äôs accused of I seriously can‚Äôt understand why anyone cares."
3349,2020-09-01 10:24:22,ikde7g,"As much as we all hate Ellen, Mariah has appeared on her show 5x since so you know - take it as you will.

Ellen‚Äôs still a cunt"
3350,2020-09-01 12:43:47,ikde7g,mariah is the queen. Don't @ me

3352,2020-09-01 09:54:17,ikde7g,"Oh dear, looks like Ellen Degenerate is at it again."
3353,2020-09-01 13:21:10,ikde7g,"Dammit, I don't want to feel bad for Mariah Carey, but that interview was just disgusting."
3354,2020-09-01 13:24:06,ikde7g,Ellen is the most degenerate talk show host ever and yes pun intended.
3355,2020-09-01 14:20:07,ikde7g,The only time it is polite to ask a woman if she is pregnant is if you can see crowning.
3356,2020-09-01 14:44:48,ikde7g,"I don‚Äôt like how Ellen hides behind her ‚Äúinnocent female‚Äù face to sexualize female stars...like she kissed Jennifer Anniston, I think. Other stuff like that always made me uncomfortable, knowing that Ellen may be deriving sexual pleasure from these forced situations"
3357,2020-09-01 18:47:40,ikde7g,I also heard Mariah is the biggest diva and has behaves in equally reprehensible ways to others.
3358,2020-09-01 19:05:56,ikde7g,I have worked for Mariah a few times. She does the same thing...
3359,2020-09-01 10:31:49,ikde7g,for some reason mariah carey is the most popular american singer in china these past few years.
3360,2020-09-01 14:14:29,ikde7g,"of course she was. We all felt the energy, what Ellen did was fucking disgusting"
3361,2020-09-01 14:18:35,ikde7g,How long is the Ellen is evil shit going to continue?
3362,2020-09-01 14:51:06,ikde7g,"To be clear: dick move by Ellen, and I am not attempting to refute that. That being said, I don't believe that Mariah miscarried that pregnancy. I believe the article is indicating that she had suffered a miscarriage previously, and was therefore being extremely cautious about sharing the news of her twins at the time. So at least it's not 100% depressing for Mariah.

Again, fuck that alcohol peer pressure move, and frankly making a woman with genuine mental health struggles, who has a reputation for being over the top, drink champagne in the morning feels insensitive to her image and her issues, even before you add a pregnancy to the mix. What if she was on medications that couldn't be mixed with alcohol instead of being pregnant?"
3363,2020-09-01 08:05:19,ikde7g,"Both of them don‚Äôt deserve attention any more, can‚Äôt we all just agree on that?"
3364,2020-09-01 13:01:33,ikde7g,Why do I give a fuck that Mariah Carey was uncomfortable 12 years ago?
3365,2020-09-01 11:26:09,ikde7g,"It's funny how everyone is just now starting to realize Ellen is a bad person. Does no one remember how she's best friends with George Bush, the war criminal?"
3366,2020-09-01 10:54:08,ikde7g,Stoke stoke stoke
3367,2020-09-01 11:21:09,ikde7g,Can we put Mariah and Ellen in a bare knuckle boxing match together? Mariah would decimate her.
3368,2020-09-01 11:31:50,ikde7g,Ellen sucks. Next
3369,2020-09-01 12:13:04,ikde7g,"After years of Hollywood tropes we find out now that, most of the parody's of off-air personalities are plain terrible people. Who would have guessed."
3370,2020-09-01 12:40:54,ikde7g,"I was a bit confused watching the video and reading the article, so she had already miscarried when this interview happened?"
3371,2020-09-01 13:24:31,ikde7g,"pregnancy is something most people prefer to keep it to themselves because with so many people eyes on your upcoming child might add to already existing distress and anxiety. A very few videos of ellen I have seen, among which was this mariah carey and ellen went all out without a shred of respect for mariah."
3372,2020-09-01 13:27:26,ikde7g,Be kind to one another yeeeep
3373,2020-09-01 14:08:11,ikde7g,"Huh, that Bojack bit seems really shitty now."
3374,2020-09-01 15:15:31,ikde7g,"Why doesn‚Äôt everyone just forget about Ellen and not pay attention to her, isn‚Äôt that the best way to make her go away?!"
3375,2020-09-01 16:03:25,ikde7g,That sounds like complete hindsight bias on Mariah's part.
3376,2020-09-01 16:16:42,ikde7g,Uh
3377,2020-09-01 16:52:41,ikde7g,"You'd think of all people, Ellen would be sensitive to how something gets out..."
3378,2020-09-01 16:53:49,ikde7g,"I vaguely remember Ellen Degeneres in her standup days.

Her act was basically ultra passive-aggressive commentary wrapped up in cheery smile.  It was funny but very, very biting.

Seemed like she developed the bubbly persona when she went mainstream?

Am I wrong?"
3379,2020-09-01 17:21:24,ikde7g,She should have told Ellen to get stuffed back then.
3380,2020-09-01 17:36:19,ikde7g,"I know it's off topic, but I wonder how Kate Mckinnon is processing all these recent news."
3381,2020-09-01 19:36:10,ikde7g,Is there video of this?
3382,2020-09-01 19:40:22,ikde7g,Being a cunt shouldn‚Äôt be punishable
3383,2020-09-01 20:00:47,ikde7g,Are used to watch the Ellen show when it first came out here but I got tired of her playing jokes and gags and everybody and making people do stupid stunts I wanna reason people come to the show was trying to win gifts and money that‚Äôs no way to host a show if you got to give a gift some money you don‚Äôt need a shell
3384,2020-09-01 20:10:25,ikde7g,Doris went bad
3385,2020-09-01 20:28:41,ikde7g,Mariah is awful too

3390,2021-01-20 18:20:32,ikde7g,Ellen Degeneres is a real-life  Joffrey Baratheon.  Evil.
3391,2020-09-01 12:34:32,ikde7g,"I dint get this story. She didn‚Äôt want to talk about it because she already had a miscarriage before she went on the show or did she have a miscarriage after the show?

None of those situations are Ellen‚Äôs fault. She has no more control over the pregnancy than Mariah did. This story is bullshit either way it‚Äôs answered."
3392,2020-09-01 10:32:12,ikde7g,"Who knew the overly cheery lesbian tv host was actually an evil, spiteful, vindictive cunt?"
3393,2020-09-01 15:31:25,ikde7g,Here we are 12 years laters digging up some more skeletons.

They probably have conditions on what can be asked and what's off limits right?"
3395,2020-09-01 12:01:30,ikde7g,Who gives a shit? Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. Mariah is almost as famous for treating the people that work for her like garbage then she is for her voice.
3396,2020-09-01 14:21:54,ikde7g,It‚Äôs funny to see how quickly public opinion has changed about Ellen. I‚Äôve been saying for years that she seems like a creep and a generally insufferable person.
3397,2020-09-01 11:05:57,ikde7g,Why do we care more about some celeb than the dozens and dozens of workers Ellen fucked over.
3398,2020-09-01 11:46:24,ikde7g,HOLY SHIT ELLEN KILLED MARIAH CAREY'S BABY!!!
3399,2020-09-01 12:19:00,ikde7g,Did anybody else catch the part in the article where she named her child Moroccan Cannon? Huh. That‚Äôs an interesting one.

I can't stand fake people like Ellen, only saw a part if a show once ot twice, she just seems so fake, You know just because its loud, doesn't make it funny, IMO

Ellen, if your reading is, it's time to redeem yourself, get off stage, just leave this all behind, share your wealth, help other people, Try not to put yourself center stage, be humble and gratefull. remember, silence is golden.

One of those times you were pregnant with the twins and Ellen again did a bit where she offered you a drink. You knew about the bit that time just like you knew about it in 2008. I find it really ridiculous that you choose to throw Ellen under the bus now, jumping on the anti Ellen bandwagon instead of supporting someone on whose show you appeared MULTIPLE times and yet we never heard a negative word about any of those appearances until now.....I call BS."

3462,2020-09-01 16:54:54,ikde7g,I kind of feel bad for Ellen. There have always been toxic work environments with daytime talk shows but Ellen got hit harder because her persona makes taking her down extra satisfying for gossip queens

so they are trying to imply that the pressure for saying she was pregnant caused the miscarriage?

I highly doubt it. this wasn't traumatic for anyone. answering a question wouldn't cause a miscarriage.

Tiffany gushed over Oprah enough that Ellen had to start acting like a complete ass to try to get the attention back onto her. The next segment they were cooking something and Ellen turned it into a total shit show so people would pay attention to her instead of Oprah. It was gross.

Not that I ever watched her show regularly, but after she stopped dancing, I felt like you could see it more and more that Ellen wasn't happy. And you're right, to me now in ALL the clips from recent shows (as in the last year or two) you can see past her facade easily. It's exactly as you said, she would rather be doing aaaaaanything else than hosting her show. It's really very sad all around, and I think this year will be the end of her show for good. Portia will be happy about that tho I guess."

She tells me couples should wait until the 4th month iirc before announcing anything or starting to make any sort of preparations. 

Miscarriage during those first few months seems to be quite a bit more common than most of us think and having to go through explaining that to their friends and family can be devastating. 

I wouldn't give a damn who I was talking to if they disrespected me with such a breach of trust and privacy. If I were an actual celebrity... I'd want her head."
3489,2020-09-01 10:12:28,ikde7g,I had never heard about that.   That‚Äôs crushing.  My wife and I announced our first pregnancy to early and had a miscarriage.  Fucking terrible when you are trying to emotionally deal but not everyone knows and brings it up in conversation.  Tough time.

I got pregnant with my (now ex) partner several years ago. He wanted to tell this parents right away and I said ok as long as they *did not tell anyone*. By the end of the same day, his entire family knew. I heard a lot through the grapevine about what a bad idea it was for us to have a baby etc (my reason for not wanting anyone to know!) but not one word of sympathy or support when the baby died and I miscarried at 3 months (a long, bloody, brutal experience).

Do NOT share people's pregnancy news with anyone without permission from the parents. It's just fucking wrong."
3491,2020-09-01 12:58:43,ikde7g,Mariah isn't crazy she's diagnosed bipolar. Stop calling people crazy
3492,2020-09-01 11:09:53,ikde7g,"Noone has any business publically asking women about pregnancies, or ask any person about their health issues ever. Let alone press them for a definitive answer.

Helen was way out of line on this one, it was horrendous, the only way I could excuse her behavior would be if it had been scripted."
3493,2020-09-01 09:54:37,ikde7g,"One of my good friends at work recently told us (that is, the rest of the team) that she was pregnant, about when she hit her second trimester. When she found out she only told our boss though, specifically because she had had a miscarriage in the past and didn't want to rush an announcement in case she miscarried so she wouldn't have to explain it to everyone or have everyone know.

I didn't know this at the time, but last year, during her birth month, one of our ""office birthday trivia"" facts (it's a game we play where we try and match people celebrating bdays that month to their facts about themselves) was 'my husband and I are expecting our third child'- someone's cute way of announcing their pregnancy. My friend started venting to me in the lab saying that someone asked her if that one was her, and she was really upset about it. At the time, I thought she was upset about it because she's also just a tad on the heavier side for her height and she felt someone was commenting on her weight, but now, knowing that she and her husband had been trying so long and had suffered a miscarriage, it all makes sense...

Of course I'm super excited for them, she and her husband are both good family friends at this point and they're gonna make great parents, they're wonderful kind people. It just sucks that they had to endure a miscarriage and I couldn't imagine having something like that outed by someone else, especially on TV."

I‚Äôm a lady, And I re-watched the interview. She was visibly uncomfortable and just ‚Äúhahaaaa oh I don‚Äôt know!!‚Äù Ellen kept asking and asking. 
After the third time I would say, ‚ÄúWhy are you still asking?? What if I am and I lose it, Ellen??‚Äù I would imagine her primarily female audience would resonate with that and maybe even groan.

Ellen‚Äôs totally the one that fucked up by putting her in that position, but come on! Spin it back on people! Especially those that ask questions because it‚Äôs just a game (or ratings) to them. I would think if I were a celebrity I would be more prepared with sharp answers to questions you know you will have to deflect. Screw Ellen. 

She did end up losing it if I recall correctly.

I'd like to think I'd stand up, tell the host that that was not public knowledge, he has violated HIPAA, this interview is over, and I hope the backlash from this ruins them. Then walk off set.

3509,2020-09-01 16:24:18,ikde7g,"A few serious questions. If Mariah hadn‚Äôt already told people she was pregnant, then how would Ellen know? Why does this article imply that Ellen caused this miscarriage by cornering Mariah about it? If you are going to get rich and famous by putting your life in the public domain, how do you get mad at the public for wanting to know more, and the interviewer for asking pointed questions? 

If it was actually a private event Mariah wanted to keep secret, she should have kept it secret.  It says in the article Mariah was uncomfortable during the interview, BECAUSE she had a miscarriage shortly after, which makes zero sense, and implies the only reason Mariah was upset was because it didn‚Äôt work out. 

>  Carey said her discomfort was due to the fact that the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage soon after her appearance on ‚ÄúThe Ellen DeGeneres Show.‚Äù

Finally, a celebrity is a celebrity because people are interested in their private lives. When celebrities stop allowing access, they lose relevance. If you want to be rich and famous and influential, that‚Äôs the cost. Love the press or lose the press. Cry me a river, Mariah."
3510,2020-09-01 08:28:54,ikde7g,Wendy Williams is the worst of the 3 by far. She's outed people's family members having cancer and blamed victims of domestic violence for the abuse.
3511,2020-09-01 08:30:30,ikde7g,"I think Wendy still takes the cake. Revealing a cancer diagnosis and revealing a pregnancy are both fucked up, but cancer seems way more fucked up to me"
3512,2020-09-01 08:38:35,ikde7g,"> Wendy Williams

by the longest shot. She goes out of her way and devotes entire shows to witch hunts that often prove to be false fucking over innocent people. Ellen is a cunt sure but Wendy straight up psychotic evil."
3513,2020-09-01 11:35:55,ikde7g,Wendy Williams revealed Method Man‚Äôs wife having cancer so I would without question say her
3514,2020-09-01 09:03:10,ikde7g,Wendy is the worst in general. Like scum incarnate. The rest are humans with bad traits.
3515,2020-09-01 11:52:13,ikde7g,"I‚Äôd go for Ellen just because Wendy‚Äôs brand is pretty trashy and you kind of know what you‚Äôre getting.

Ellen‚Äôs portrayed herself as the really wholesome friendly person and she is also a lot more powerful.

Also, while Wendy hurts celebrities, we haven‚Äôt heard much from the people working on the show like we have with Ellen."
3516,2020-09-01 11:13:27,ikde7g,Wendy hates what she sees in the mirror so you tell me.
3517,2020-09-01 10:25:27,ikde7g,"I think ellen.  
While wendy is a piece of crap of a person, you know who the shit are dealing with.  
With ellen, it is all smoke and mirrors and hypocrisy."
3518,2020-09-01 08:11:47,ikde7g,All 3 of them are bitches.
3519,2020-09-01 09:24:34,ikde7g," Genuine question: Is Ellen really that much worse than your average talk show host, or is she just this summer's trending topic? Don't watch her show, and pretty out of the loop on the hate for her (aside from the articles on people saying they hated her workplace). But Hasan Minhaj got similar criticism recently which has made me wonder if Ellen deserves to be the target of criticism or if other competitors of hers have similar work environments"
3520,2020-09-01 11:55:20,ikde7g,Def Wendy
3521,2020-09-01 12:50:55,ikde7g,Ellen has a poor attitude but Wendy Williams is an absolutely immoral and vile person and her audience is pretty putrid as well.
3522,2020-09-01 13:56:54,ikde7g,"wendy williams is still WAY The worst, it's not even close dude.  


Ellen's just a regular person, and regular people fuck up sometimes.  THIS Is overkill.  


all the people complaining about Ellen have never had to worry a day in their life."
3523,2020-09-01 14:08:51,ikde7g,"Wendy is like Trump, she was born in and feeds on garbage, so it‚Äôs kind of impossible to knock her down a peg. Ellen managed to hide her shitty side until now, Wendy has always been a double stack pile of shit and it‚Äôs why she‚Äôs famous."
3524,2020-09-01 14:21:59,ikde7g,"The backlash is bigger for Ellen because fans of her look at her as a great person who spreads joy and positivity, that's her brand. With Wendy Williams there's no hiding it. She plays up how shitty she is and that she's the one person saying ""what we're all thinking"", That's her brand."
3525,2020-09-01 14:31:26,ikde7g,Wendy by a mile.
3526,2020-09-01 15:56:06,ikde7g,Wendy Williams by a longshot. They‚Äôre not even comparable.
3527,2020-09-01 16:24:51,ikde7g,"Ellen‚Äôs bitchy but she‚Äôs passive aggressive. Wendy is a straight up bitch who witch hunts, says mean things, & will say controversial things that are completely inappropriate because she thinks she‚Äôs cute."
3528,2020-09-01 16:29:26,ikde7g,"Lol..... Ellen is just rich and bitter, Wendy is a psychopath."
3529,2020-09-01 17:02:45,ikde7g,"Wendy Williams is a terrible person ON HER SHOW for everyone to see. [She advocated for women lying about taking birth control (when their partner has told them they don't want kids) and tried to act like it was a women's right ""you're in control of your own body"" situation...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CNHwhHWPoQ) 

At least Ellen tries to hide it. Personally I don't understand the people who pretended Ellen was some saint. Her show is a walking advertisement where she gives WalMart money away to viral families. People act like shes donating her own wealth and is some sort of philanthropist... Shes always been a pushy narcissist. You just weren't allowed to say that until recently because she and her defenders would just pull the gay card."
3530,2020-09-01 09:23:01,ikde7g,"They're not even comparable, quite frankly."
3531,2020-09-01 11:47:02,ikde7g,If a lot of what we have been hearing about Ellen through the years is true then its her.
3532,2020-09-01 16:48:19,ikde7g,Day time talk shows are all fucking horrible.
3533,2020-09-01 19:06:46,ikde7g,"I had a roomate who was a fan of Williams' show, and I guess that assholery rubbed off since that individual was one of the fakest and most petty pieces of shit I've known. Seems like a pattern with her."
3534,2020-09-01 20:09:23,ikde7g,Surprised I haven‚Äôt seen anything on this thread about her straight up telling a woman to trick her partner into getting her pregnant
3535,2020-09-02 00:36:48,ikde7g,"Wendy Fuckin Williams.

I don't use this word to describe many women, but she is a total cunt.

She has no regard for humans and I can only imagine how sick and twisted her life is off camera.  

Just a horrible person."
3536,2020-09-01 10:19:54,ikde7g,Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson are so much worse than both that I‚Äôm not sure you‚Äôll have energy left after disliking them.
3537,2020-09-01 12:43:05,ikde7g,Any amount of energy you devote to hating something you don't watch is too much. You're only making yourself miserable. Ellen doesn't care that you hate her.
3538,2020-09-01 10:11:42,ikde7g,"Ellen, for her willingness to work with the State Department and friendship with GWB."

3541,2020-09-01 10:27:40,ikde7g,"Not to mention the time when she pressured Taylor Swift into admitting to dating Justin Bieber until the point where she literally started crying on air. No idea if she was dating him or not (and neither do I care) but you could tell Taylor was extremely uncomfortable and even said she is afraid to talk about this because she would get tons of hate mail, but clearly Ellen could not give a fuck.

Edit: it was Zac Efron not Bieber, my bad"

3545,2020-09-01 13:19:01,ikde7g,Jamie Foxx probably understood the awkwardness of the question and handled it pretty well. He's a great guy.

.......what?

It seems to be one of the main reasons people don‚Äôt like her. The diva stuff can be a legitimate gripe but idk, I‚Äôve never heard stories of her being mean to people, just difficult. People are way too quick to laugh at her and root for her failure after the whole Glitter thing. She‚Äôs been through hell, just let the girl live."
3552,2020-09-01 12:05:58,ikde7g,Thank you for saying that! You‚Äôre absolutely right.

3558,2020-09-01 15:20:35,ikde7g,"I didn't know that she has a diagnosis. 

I interpreted the ""she's crazy but it was still wrong"" as referring to the fact that Mariah is known to have a diva-type, high maintenance personality, and might be offended or upset at what many others would consider an inoffensive remark, but in this case Ellen's behavior was anything but inoffensive. 

Knowing that she has a diagnosed mental illness and is not just a high maintenance ""Don't You Know Who I Am"" diva sort of changes things"

3566,2020-09-01 09:50:42,ikde7g,"Ellen radiates this really nasty attitude, it just screams ""bully"". The way she pressures people always keeping a stright face.

It's hard to watch the scene in the Mariah interview when she returns with alcohol, like ""well if you're not pregnant you can drink"" What if Mariah was so uncomfortable she tried to hide that? All Ellen cared about was getting a story, there was an unborn child there and Ellen is already poking at it and trying to profit off of it, truely nasty."
3567,2020-09-01 11:41:33,ikde7g,"She hates her audience and her job, and doesn‚Äôt really try to hide it, yet people still say how nice she is. I don‚Äôt get it."

The TFATK subreddit have been pointing out for a long time how schaub and Callen were assholes and douchebags, and while you have fans who wished up and opened their eyes, you still seen fans being die hard and still supporting them even after both of those assholes caught the coronavirus after downplaying the virus and still going out in public to perform at comedy clubs."

They earn more, they can work until they retire, they can be unattractive and successful, they don't get sexualized and objectified by default. Male strippers existing is *really* not the problem here.

Also Chris Pine obviously."

3576,2020-09-01 15:26:56,ikde7g,"I'm honestly surprised she was able to hang on this long - it just goes to show you how good the network is at managing it. 

The level of cringe her interviews were was absolutely outstanding, but I guess it had enough audience that the network was desperate to keep. They probably couldn't find another person so mean to be willing to go up there and ask the type of questions that 'trend' and get them the sort of attention that draws in viewers. 

The shows is mostly filler (dancing, wating for the audience to calm down after some umbrella statement) with one interview or segment that is the crowning jewel, where Ellen would act 'outrageous' or whatever, startle the guest, ask 'trend worthy questions', and generally just be an AH to whoever was in the hot seat. Other than that it was nothing. Literally nothing. I think a lot of us were expecting it to start dying out anyway because there seemed to be a lot of other shows starting up that seemed more interesting, but because Elle was so established it wasn't likely.

I'm glad though that she's finally getting her comeuppance. I think it's been a long time coming that she realizes what it felt like to be the one in the hotseat and I hope she can grow out of her own ass from this experience."
3577,2020-09-01 15:56:55,ikde7g,"I *love* her old standup routines. Just so simple, silly and hilarious.

She looks like a totally different person now, tho, her behaviour and even her appearance are kind of... mean."

3588,2020-09-01 18:28:26,ikde7g,"Tabloid fodder is rarely flattering. She's actually a beautiful spirit but that doesn't sell -- the people want mess. TMZ won't tell you she's been bank rolling an organization called the [Fresh Air Fund](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/visited-camp-mariah-mariah-carey-helping-change-lives-64793581) since the '90s that provides disadvantaged kids with an outlet for career awareness and the arts. She's been very open about her struggles growing up poor and biracial throughout her career, and giving back has always been important to her.

She is fiercely protective of her own kids as well. Your statement takes **her** version of events out of context (she said she fires them when they ""try to make themselves more important than me"" and that she ""hates doing it""). Nobody can really say what the truth is there, but it's clear to me that her **intent** is to protect her and her kids -- it's not retribution, as you suggest."

3604,2020-09-01 13:16:35,ikde7g,"Let‚Äôs be real, a famous person turning out to be a conceited asshole is nothing new. Im not really sure why Reddit and the media has latched on to the Ellen story so hard other than a general ‚Äúthe bigger they are, the harder they fall‚Äù type thing."
3605,2020-09-01 20:50:12,ikde7g,"In addition to her and her producers treatment of staff (racism and sexual assault which is a big enough issue on its own), I have always had a problem with how she treats audience members and guests. Her pranks are usually mean spirited, like oh x has a genuine phobia of y, well let‚Äôs expose them to it on live tv won‚Äôt that be funny. It‚Äôs unnecessary cruel for a couple of cheap laughs. Also, she on camera treats guest and audience members rudely, so I can only imagine how she treats people when the camera is off. I just never found her funny, especially since so much of her jokes are mean spirited and harmful. That‚Äôs not even taking into consideration all the rumors and stories circulating, just the behaviors she has presented to the world to see. That‚Äôs why it is so problematic. I don‚Äôt understand why anybody liked her until now."
3606,2020-09-01 15:26:23,ikde7g,"I think part of it is that her ""image"" is a super kind sweet wholesome lady who loves kids and Disney and is everyone's friend. Who crusades against bullying and just wants to make the world a positive and happy place full of sunshine and care bears.

But as it turns out she's quite the opposite of all of that. I don't really think many other talk show hosts try to have that kind of uber wholesome image."
3607,2020-09-02 00:16:45,ikde7g,This. Appears to me she's just the latest trendy celebrity to hate.
3608,2020-09-01 15:48:52,ikde7g,"Here's my theory - it's a fact that both were pulling about the same amount of viewers at times, but Ellen has gotten a lot more shit than Wendy because Wendy never pretended to be anything else than trashy talk show shock jock. 

No one put Wendy up on a pedestal - you watched her show for the trashy gossip which meant she had a type of niche audience that wasn't going to get offended easily. They came for trash and trash they got. I used to watch her in my early twenties, but after her divorce when got, IMO, meaner so I stopped being able to stomach it, but at the time I was looking for mindless shit to watch and Wendy didn't stress me out. 

Ellen, on the other hand, had early on been going for a different level of audience - she was going for more of the friendly look that drew a lot of people in at first, but as time passed and she became so established you couldn't say boo about her without everyone being up in arms. She had to much pull at a huge network to be criticized to seriously - and after Oprah ended, she filled a certain hole left behind which gave her even more pull. It was really only a matter of time before people stopped being able to tolerate her crap, but people put up with it because it was 'Ellen', and there really wasn't too much else on or advertised as much. She still got big names, so if you were a celeb stalker that's who you'd watch. 

So when all the sudden a few people stand their ground and call Ellen out, bored people stuck in quarantine with little else to do suddenly were paying attention, and then it didn't take much for the dam to break and everyone to start paying attention to how truly shitty Ellen was. This in no way would have gained the traction it did if not for the fact that everyone was thrown off their usual routine and looking for something to take their mind of it."
3609,2020-09-01 14:03:28,ikde7g,"Wendy Williams is black. so if you call her out for being a huge pile of trash, you are going to be labeled a racist."

3612,2020-09-01 13:22:11,ikde7g,I think this one strikes a nerve because pregnancy is such a delicate subject. And it's just encouraging rude behavior.

3616,2020-09-01 07:26:14,ikde7g,"Can you please reword your comment? Like others are saying, I‚Äôm struggling to understand what you‚Äôre trying to even communicate. Also, how does not being a fan of her music relate to this?"
3617,2020-09-01 05:55:44,ikde7g,Can you elaborate at all?
3618,2020-09-01 07:54:44,ikde7g,"Read what her sister said about Mariah and ritual sacrifices, you‚Äôll understand"

3622,2020-09-01 18:57:27,ikde7g,I remember when everybody supposedly loved Ellen until they were told to stop and did like the cattle that they are.
3623,2020-09-01 14:15:59,ikde7g,">of course she was. We all felt the energy, what Ellen did was fucking disgusting

yea, disgusting and all that stuff.

at least you can't blame men for this one."
3624,2020-09-01 18:50:07,ikde7g,"No. She was pregnant at the time, and miscarried shortly after. She had given interviews on it."
3625,2020-09-01 13:16:20,ikde7g,"Would you have cared if she was friends with Obama, the war criminal? If the answer is still yes, move along."

3627,2020-09-01 16:21:45,ikde7g,It really does
3628,2020-09-01 12:55:24,ikde7g,"She didn't want to talk about whether or not she was pregnant. Ellen forced the issue by being manipulative,  she offered her an alcoholic drink so then Mariah was basically forced to admit she was pregnant by refusing the drink or else if she did drink it  she would be seen as a horrible person for drinking while pregnant when eventually found out. Later after the interview she miscarried."
3629,2020-09-01 22:53:47,ikde7g,Bruh üíÄ come on
3630,2020-09-01 11:54:10,ikde7g,Because then tomorrow's headlines become about how they stormed off a talk show because they're such a diva. You literally can't win with tabloid media.
3631,2020-09-01 20:36:25,ikde7g,"She isn't. That's literally a rumor that I'm positive you cannot prove to be correct. Either way, that doesn't excuse the fact that what Ellen did to her was awful"
3632,2020-09-01 21:13:41,ikde7g,"Because she can (and has) blame the worker stuff on the producers, network, and other staff. She can‚Äôt shift blame for the things she is on camera doing and saying."
3633,2020-09-01 21:26:32,ikde7g,"It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs not normalized to talk about miscarriages. It‚Äôs that it is a private painful thing. Their are all the feelings of a loved one/child‚Äôs death, plus feelings of inadequacy, self loathing, and lack of control. Should women and their partners have open and safe places to discuss their miscarriages yes. But it‚Äôs not as simple as well let‚Äôs talk about it more."
3634,2020-09-01 12:22:57,ikde7g,"People are capable of focusing on more than one thing at a time, surprisingly."

3636,2020-09-01 21:19:08,ikde7g,"I think it‚Äôs evident from many of her other cringey and awkward interviews that she either brings up topics that were not approved, or she keeps pushing past previous agreed limits/goes off script. There have been times when guest have straight up asked her to stop/let something go and she doesn‚Äôt.

Edited for spelling:stupid auto correct"
3637,2020-09-01 11:32:44,ikde7g,"I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre being downvoted. There is absolutely no way this wasn‚Äôt discussed beforehand. I certainly believe that it would have been painful to talk about, though."
3638,2020-09-01 20:58:24,ikde7g,"Poorly written, She was uncomfortable on the show because of the possibility of having a miscarriage (which is way more common than most people know). Also it should be a joyous occasion to let people know you are pregnant on your own terms, not have that experience taken from you by someone else for financial gain. That would make anyone uncomfortable. Then once she had a miscarriage she was unable to privately grieve. How could she have her time and space to mourn if the whole world knows and expects you to be pregnant. It would indeed be uncomfortable to have to go through that aftermath of people constant bringing it up, the speculation of why she‚Äôs not getting visibly any bigger, et cetera"
3639,2020-09-01 20:36:44,ikde7g,Explain how?
3640,2020-09-01 14:29:29,ikde7g,"You tell us, you're the one commenting."
3641,2020-09-01 13:41:19,ikde7g,No
3642,2020-09-01 09:36:49,ikde7g,"I mean, right now you're ""getting mad"" at people for getting mad at non-crimes, which is itself a non-crime. So I would say you're guilty of this yourself."
3643,2020-09-01 08:00:01,ikde7g,It‚Äôs probably pretty uncomfortable when your pregnancy gets announced on live tv when you didn‚Äôt approve of that and a miscarriage follows shortly after
3644,2020-09-01 12:18:45,ikde7g,"I would really prefer not to, if it's all the same to you."
3645,2020-09-01 07:56:10,ikde7g,"I‚Äôm no fan either but have a bit of decorum, ay?"

3647,2020-09-01 05:22:21,ikde7g,this isn't new information.
3648,2020-09-01 13:23:30,ikde7g,What?
3649,2020-09-01 17:34:50,ikde7g,She doesn‚Äôt support Trump.
3650,2020-09-01 17:15:06,ikde7g,There‚Äôs a difference between being a conservative and being a trump supporter. Just look at Trump‚Äôs completely irresponsible fiscal policy.
3651,2020-09-01 10:38:57,ikde7g,"You could ask her, but I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôd turn down your offer."
3652,2020-09-01 10:17:27,ikde7g,?!
3653,2020-09-01 09:39:32,ikde7g,Oh so you‚Äôre one of those people that thinks straw men are real arguments then?
3654,2020-09-01 05:06:52,ikde7g,It‚Äôs not your place to tell someone who felt this level of discomfort when and when not to speak about it.
3655,2020-09-01 05:24:43,ikde7g,"Ah yes, once you‚Äôre wealthy you‚Äôre no longer a person. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs no depressed wealthy people! They don‚Äôt have feelings/emotion."
3656,2020-09-01 05:30:33,ikde7g,"When someone is trying to force you to announce something you're not prepared to announce, you can get pretty uncomfortable"

3658,2020-09-01 05:41:35,ikde7g,Try it and find out. Oh... Wait... You can‚Äôt.
3659,2020-09-01 13:05:57,ikde7g,Mariah is famous for writing 18 out of her 19 number one hits .. more than any other solo artist. Mariah is famous for her five octave range. Mariah is famous for her timeless Christmas album including the biggest Christmas song created in the last forty years
3660,2020-09-01 12:52:09,ikde7g,Ok so she's definitely changed a bit right? I also haven't watched or paid attention to an episode of Ellen in at least 10 years. And I maybe only saw half of an episode  a couple of times back then. But she always seemed perfectly nice so  this all came out of the blue for me. I was beginning to wonder if I was just a terrible judge of character.
3661,2020-09-01 13:53:05,ikde7g,That would explain a lot.
3662,2020-09-01 15:32:30,ikde7g,Maybe she wants to be cancelled so she can get out of it without penalty
3663,2020-09-01 17:49:26,ikde7g,"She‚Äôs so rich...she can just quit, pay them the money back, give away half of her wealth after, and STILL be able to live several lifetimes without ever having to check her bank account. 

No pity for or excuses for her behavior. It‚Äôs disgusting"
3664,2020-09-01 17:11:25,ikde7g,I think stuff changed around 2014? Sometime around then when she stopped dancing through the audience during the opening it was clear she was getting old and stopped having fun. The past few years that I have occasionally seen parts of episodes (she is on before the news so sometimes I leave it on) it seems like she is mainly doing clip show segments of old Ellen (‚Äúhey remember when I did this? that was fun...‚Äù) or just blocks of *cute viral content*. Kind of sad to see but I also really don‚Äôt care
3665,2020-09-01 18:21:41,ikde7g,"There's justice in Ellen feeling like a mistreated and unhappy employee, I think."
3666,2020-09-01 18:01:13,ikde7g,"Sure, we all don‚Äôt want to go to work but....get a weighted blanket and have a weekend snooze.  Super rejuvenating."
3667,2020-09-01 19:13:12,ikde7g,Should have done an opera and got her own channel
3668,2020-09-01 19:47:23,ikde7g,Nah she was a dick 20 years ago too.
3669,2020-09-01 19:08:26,ikde7g,"she could easily end the show.

And today I'm going to be talking to this hambeast in the front row, if she can finish her slurpy cup of gravy before we get to her.

3672,2020-09-01 17:26:28,ikde7g,"I just watched the cooking clip you mentioned, yikes. Even more disgusting, YouTube comments of people thinking it was hilarious."
3673,2020-09-01 22:30:59,ikde7g,"Cooking segments on talk shows are very rarely any good from what I've seen. I remember when Claire from Bon Appetit (before all the drama) came on to teach Jimmy Fallon how to ice and decorate a cake and he was so clearly ruining it for ""the lols"". 

It wasn't even amusing and you could tell Claire was getting put off by his antics towards the end."
3674,2020-09-01 20:12:11,ikde7g,"Not to defend her because all things considered her life is fucking easy, but it must suck being stuck in a contract that forces you to keep the same job for the next 3 years even though you don't wanna do it anymore."

3679,2020-09-01 19:48:01,ikde7g,All of the shit comes down to high school gossip anyways. What the hell do we care about any of this. There is more important shit in the world
3680,2020-09-01 18:00:30,ikde7g,"Let me tell you it sucks to be a child bearing age woman sometimes because everyone suspects you are pregnant if anything is up. Didn‚Äôt want a beer? Pregnant. Didn‚Äôt feel like eating Subway sandwiches? Pregnant? Have the flu? Pregnant.

Stay out of peoples business and don‚Äôt ask any woman if she is pregnant (unless you‚Äôre a medical professional). They either aren‚Äôt and you‚Äôre being rude or they are and didn‚Äôt want to tell you yet."
3681,2020-09-01 10:34:21,ikde7g,"I‚Äôm sorry to hear that you went through this. We‚Äôre going through this and it‚Äôs tough.

3682,2020-09-01 19:38:28,ikde7g,"That‚Äôs so awful, I‚Äôm sorry."
3683,2020-09-01 13:47:31,ikde7g,"I don't think people even know that she's bipolar. I think people think of her meltdown on TRL/post-Glitter as defining her as ""crazy""--which, once you know what she was going through at the time, that label is not strictly speaking fair. Or maybe it's the diva antics and Lisa Frank-esque album themes. Either way, she's had an incredible career, and the way people treat her (and other older women in the entertainment industry) now is pretty awful."
3684,2020-09-01 18:21:36,ikde7g,"Plus she went through a ton of shit that couldn't have helped. I saw a YouTube video that broke down her life after she divorced her ex, Tommy Motolla, and I ended up feeling really bad for her. He straight tried to ruin her career, had people spying on her, and used Jennifer Lopez as an up and coming performer to steal songs that he knew Mariah was about to release such as a duet with Ja Rule. All that coupled with the stress of working all the time and a movie bombing - it's no wonder Mariah hit such rough patch. Anyone might have snapped, let alone someone suffering from bipolar disorder."
3685,2020-09-01 17:12:35,ikde7g,"it‚Äôs so annoying seeing that everywhere on this thread. she is such an inspirational and iconic artist, and for people to say things like ‚Äúshe‚Äôs crazy but...‚Äù or ‚Äúi never liked her but‚Äù is just unnecessary and ignorant"
3686,2020-09-01 14:38:47,ikde7g,Exactly.
3687,2020-09-01 13:44:52,ikde7g,"Wouldnt have used that word if I had know (I suffer from a disorder that involves emotional disregulation personally so I feel that struggle, hope she‚Äôs got effective treatment). Never seen anything that mentioned she‚Äôs bipolar before. Not that I look up a ton of news or info about her though, maybe it is often mentioned ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
3688,2020-09-01 13:28:53,ikde7g,"pregnancy in general is a scary thing, so many things can go wrong. Miscarriages are super sad because no one did anything wrong, they just happen and are super common in first trimester and less each subsequent trimester. 

I sincerely hope you and everyone else here has a great rest of the week. Much love to you all."
3689,2020-09-01 15:16:00,ikde7g,Since Reddit decided dealing with mental issues or personality disorders means you‚Äôre ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù.
3690,2020-09-01 18:15:19,ikde7g,"Again, had literally no idea she was bipolar otherwise I would have used different phrasing. As someone with mental illness I understand, but when I had literally never seen a single thing stating that was the case it‚Äôs an honest mistake.

Maybe don‚Äôt assume everyone is aware of that information. Not everyone reads up on every celebrity and their health."
3691,2020-09-01 13:06:19,ikde7g,"Even if they don't care about is, it's ok to empathize with someone who's in the situation Mariah was in. Nobody is rich enough that their miscarriage doesn't bother them."
3692,2020-09-01 10:13:53,ikde7g,Take a deep breath and go outside. You shouldn‚Äôt let two very dumb entertainers represent your country in your mind.

3697,2020-09-01 09:52:54,ikde7g,">We are all going be alright

Oh my sweet summer child"
3698,2020-09-01 11:51:14,ikde7g,"Yeah this shit is all a distraction. Ellen is the sacrificial lamb. Once someone breaks that threshold of controversy, it becomes a pile on, and the industry pretends that they're actually trying to be better."
3699,2020-09-01 10:40:34,ikde7g,"Preach, chief!"
3700,2020-09-01 15:34:20,ikde7g,"Yes but you have to keep in mind celebrities, while it shouldn‚Äôt have to be such a large worry, have to keep a good image in the public eye. Speaking back could be perceived as aggressive and backfire on them sadly and that could have negative impacts on said image and how people think of them."
3701,2020-09-01 18:33:37,ikde7g,"I don't think it's necessarily about confidence.  You presumably don't go on the Ellen show to do battle with Ellen, you want to come off good on television.   If you snap back at Ellen, even if totally justified, it's a negative interaction that will leave a bad taste with viewers who are used to watching a show that is all smiles."
3702,2020-10-01 06:46:20,ikde7g,"Sorry got a notif for this comment read it as 3am and misread/understood it I think and responded incorrectly. Deleted it, my apologies."
3703,2020-09-01 15:14:32,ikde7g,Seriously doubt it. Even though the stress of the situation could have had an effect maybe I don‚Äôt see how you could without a doubt prove it in court.
3704,2020-09-01 15:06:13,ikde7g,"Sure would. The accusations levied against her are bad, would absolutely want to know more detailed information from reliable sources. Did used to think of her as a good person, uhhh not so much anymore to say the least haha. I started to feel off about her a ways back when she would interview male music groups I like and pressure them about being single and dating fans when they very clearly did not want to discuss or answer such questions."
3705,2020-09-01 16:30:08,ikde7g,"She‚Äôs not a celebrity because people are interested in her private life she‚Äôs famous and a celebrity for being a singer. While you‚Äôre in the public eye people aren‚Äôt entitled to the entirety of your business, celebrities are still people too at the end of the day. 

As far as how Ellen knowing to ask? Rumors. Or someone close leaked it. Plenty of people close to celebs have leaked info to the media for a payout. Not complicated for that info to spread around even if you don‚Äôt want it to."
3706,2020-09-01 10:45:24,ikde7g,She romanticised R.Kelly‚Äôs grooming and pedophilia in that awful Aaliyah biopic she produced.

3714,2020-09-29 19:58:44,ikde7g,That's why they're hosts to begin with. Maybe the problem is the legacy media system that rewards this type of behavior.

3728,2020-09-01 11:26:45,ikde7g,"Summer's trending cancel topic. A lot of people never learned the ""celebrities aren't what they're like on TV"" lesson that every kids show teaches. So Ellen is A big deal because it contradicts the upbeat positive person she plays on TV."
3729,2020-09-01 09:47:40,ikde7g,She‚Äôs this summers reddit target. Idk why Reddit has it out for Ellen so much from what I‚Äôve seen Reddit has adopted the toxic twitter cancel culture and have a hard on for Ellen right now outside of Reddit I haven‚Äôt seen anyone making such a big deal about it. I‚Äôm not at all trying to justify what happened just that Reddit seems to have really serious escalated things
3730,2020-09-01 11:35:56,ikde7g,It‚Äôs uncomfortable for sure
3731,2020-09-01 14:58:05,ikde7g,"He hated interviews at it was, on top of always being asked about Spider-Man. I‚Äôm sure he already didn‚Äôt want to be there"
3732,2020-09-01 19:04:41,ikde7g,Does a leg on a table indicate anger or irritation? Genuinely asking
3733,2020-09-01 12:31:45,ikde7g,"I think she also tried to out some actor she thought was gay. I don't remember the actor but I remember seeing a clip and the dude looked so uncomfortable during her questions. I don't even think he was actually gay either, I think he was just friends with another dude, but she put a picture of the other guy up and kept needling him about it.

Like, as a gay person, outing someone who isn't ready to come out is a huge asshole move. It happens a lot unfortunately. Cause there are others in the community who think we shouldn't have a reason to hide. 

Like maybe 5 people know I'm gay, but I had to let those people know hey, there's stuff I have to get settled financially/mentally/emotionally before I come out so don't like, post anything on social media with me in it."
3734,2020-09-01 14:49:22,ikde7g,Not that it matters but it was Zac Efron not Justin Bieber. They previously had been on the show promoting the Lorax so Ellen saw that as her opportunity.
3735,2020-09-01 10:50:04,ikde7g,Ok but didn't Taylor Swift keep going back on Ellen like a thousand times?
3736,2020-09-01 18:19:07,ikde7g,"> Taylor was extremely uncomfortable and even said she is afraid to talk about this because she would get tons of hate mail

Sounds like Ellen would have been writing a lot of it herself."

3738,2020-09-01 13:43:52,ikde7g,Interesting! I haven‚Äôt watched this but Jamie Fox kept his relationship with Katie Holmes hidden for YEARS. You would think he‚Äôd pick up a clue sooner.
3739,2020-09-01 16:19:58,ikde7g,Wow that‚Äôs awful.
3740,2020-09-01 18:51:30,ikde7g,Wow I'd never seen that before. Poor Taylor. She's humiliated.
3741,2020-09-01 17:11:53,ikde7g,Definitely. It would have been way more awkward if Jamie hadn't been there to comic relief the situation.
3742,2020-09-01 17:17:44,ikde7g,"its the character she plays and who she plays too *the pushy drunk horny aunt* 

you know when you are like 14 and with a female friend and that one family member is immediately like *‚ÄùOOOOO WHO IS THIS PRETTY LADY?? IS THIS YOUR GIIRRRLLFRIEND‚Äù* and just really makes things awkward. that who Ellen is playing too. 
same reason she always will have her attractive male guests take off their shirts, does an old bitter lesbian care about a ripped young guy? no. but she knows her audience does so she encourages it"
3743,2020-09-01 15:04:21,ikde7g,"Agreed. That‚Äôs more Jamie Fox then anyone else, this is not that extreme at all"
3744,2020-09-01 16:00:15,ikde7g,"Honestly no one have a shit one they first came out. That's how these talk shows are sometimes - a little edgy and fun.   
What because she's a woman she can't press people like the late night hosts?"
3745,2020-09-01 14:11:49,ikde7g,Damn kids these days won‚Äôt let‚Äôs us objectify the private lives of famous people! What a dumb fucking take
3746,2020-09-01 13:02:28,ikde7g,"While I like the sentiment to forget the haters, the first part of your comment is part of the issue. If she wasn't bipolar would people be bringing up her sanity? It has no relevance to the topic at hand."
3747,2020-09-01 16:29:54,ikde7g,"I mean she‚Äôs still a diva but people these cats don‚Äôt understand the constant comparing she went through she was starting out. It caused feuds when there didn‚Äôt need to be a feud. I‚Äôd be annoyed being constantly compared too. She‚Äôs also watched so many of her friends die so it makes more sense why she so high strung.

Her mental issues just add onto that & amp it up without her control sometimes."

People vehemently defended her and I was like ""No. She's a shit person. Seriously.""

I'm sad there's no way to go back and say ""I told you so!"" to all the fanboys that blindly defended her. >:("
3751,2020-09-01 19:34:05,ikde7g,"For sure, I would've felt that way even if she didn't have a miscarriage, but that is just the terrible cherry on top as well as the only reason we are calling her on it now"

3756,2020-09-01 15:55:14,ikde7g,"She used to be nice. Her sense of humor was silly, playful and even complimented people while making jokes about them. At some point she became super hateful for some reason."
3757,2020-09-01 10:35:48,ikde7g,"Both those guys are assholes. But, the tfatk sub is an extremely toxic sub, one of the most negative subs on Reddit. Wouldn‚Äôt hold them up as a beacon of reason lol."
3758,2020-09-01 11:44:00,ikde7g,His laughing to celebrities may be phoney but I dont see him as a phoney person. When he is interviewed he is a very down to earth person
3759,2020-09-01 10:30:28,ikde7g,Not sure what‚Äôs your point but whether you like him or not he‚Äôs nowhere near as big a piece of shit as Ellen.
3760,2020-09-01 10:23:15,ikde7g,"To be honest, the entire late night talk show thing just needs to end. All it is is bringing on celebrities and basically asking really stupid questions to promote bullshit. Then there  might be a comic, a musical performance, some party games etc all thrown in passed off as a lame variety hour.

I enjoy and watch movies, but I really don't understand the complete celebrity worship in  this country. I know people always like to point out that every culture in history has had people they idolized and worshipped, but it's gotten out of control. This entire culture is incredibly toxic on every level."
3761,2020-09-01 12:05:50,ikde7g,"How is that relevant? You may find him annoying, but what indications are there that he's a bad person or runs a toxic workplace?"
3762,2020-09-01 09:31:15,ikde7g,I saw youtube clips and snippets. I have genuinely never watched a single full episode of that god awful shit.
3763,2020-09-01 22:28:29,ikde7g,You are missing the entire point. Not to mention there are so many things wrong with your counterpoints it's hard to know where to begin.
3764,2020-09-01 15:28:34,ikde7g,"I don't remember it, unfortunately. I was sort of hoping this worked as a backdoor to see it again"
3765,2020-09-01 15:38:23,ikde7g,"I asked like 200 fans of hers what makes her show good or funny, and most couldn't give me an answer. Just that she was funny and the show was good......"
3766,2020-09-01 21:01:27,ikde7g,Work sets you free right? :)
3767,2020-09-01 18:52:33,ikde7g,"About people? Yeah fuck you too, hope I can someday laugh at your mental instabilities."

3771,2020-09-01 07:23:49,ikde7g,Firing your kids favorite nannies is going to fuck them up later in life. MC is not all there mentally. Maybe borderline personality disorder.
3772,2020-09-01 07:55:27,ikde7g,Yeah. Ones an awkward embarrassment for a multi-millionairess and the other is a low-paid worker losing their job.
3773,2020-09-01 07:40:25,ikde7g,Okay what about when she sexually harassed her bodyguard?
3774,2020-09-01 08:22:15,ikde7g,Mariah Carey has done lots of other shitty things beside just that...
3775,2020-09-01 12:12:15,ikde7g,"is it? cause i can't quite make up my mind which is worse, maybe the nanny one since you're fucking up your kids psychologically cause of your own jealousy."
3776,2020-09-01 09:18:56,ikde7g,But she isn't throwing stones. She merely said she was uncomfortable.
3777,2020-09-01 13:55:50,ikde7g,So? That's not the point. What is up with everyone and whataboutisms.

3780,2020-09-01 06:14:14,ikde7g,Maybe you can tell us instead why you think firing a nanny because your kids love them might be a good thing?
3781,2020-09-01 06:12:02,ikde7g,Sounds like an incredibly cruel thing to do to the kids if it's true. r/insaneparents material.
3782,2020-09-01 07:59:18,ikde7g,Truth
3783,2020-09-01 08:21:59,ikde7g,She did use her stillborn baby as a stepping stone in her talk show career. Its only fair that Mariah get to kick her off when she is losing grip.
3784,2020-09-03 12:39:28,ikde7g,They were never even friends with eachother in the first place. The only reason she even talked about it was because she was asked in a interview since the clip of her and Ellen blew up online.
3785,2020-09-02 06:43:34,ikde7g,That whole episode was super awkward. You could tell Jerry didn't like her by the way he was sniping at her. I wonder why he even invited her?
3786,2020-09-02 18:02:41,ikde7g,There is no need to act like a b$tch about it. Eat a snicker.
3787,2020-09-01 14:16:16,ikde7g,"Outside of Conan, I have seen near-exact comments of every single late night hosts on Reddit. Everyone has friends full of stories about how bad they are."
3788,2020-09-01 15:51:37,ikde7g,"I imagine the work culture was vastly different between all of those talk show hosts, given who heads them and the networks they were on. Honestly not surprised Ellen was the worst (by far) for most...I'd be curious to hear what it was like working under Corden, considering all the crap we hear about him."
3789,2020-09-01 17:21:16,ikde7g,What's the best host?
3790,2020-09-01 17:32:02,ikde7g,"She's based her show on her own image, and she's cultivated an image of kindness and generosity which doesn't ring true."
3791,2020-09-01 15:52:11,ikde7g,It‚Äôs because she has a ‚Äúnice‚Äù persona. It‚Äôs like when evangelical preachers getting caught with sex workers.
3792,2020-09-01 15:26:04,ikde7g,"Has this ever actually happened? If you take a gander through this thread and any thread that mentions Wendy, she gets trashed pretty thoroughly and everyone joins in with glee. People probably won‚Äôt call you racist if you aren‚Äôt doing racist things."
3793,2020-09-02 07:43:53,ikde7g,"Why does almost everyone thinking that standing up for yourself means being a cunt? Is it really that unacceptable to mention ‚Äúthat‚Äôs quite private Ellen, & I‚Äôm uncomfortable talking about this right now?‚Äù"
3794,2020-09-01 17:09:17,ikde7g,"I may be wrong, but I took what OP said to mean in general, as Reddit has had a hate boner for Ellen for months now with any negative stuff about her getting thousands of upvotes. Not to downplay anything she has done but why her specifically? There are people much more horrible than her in Hollywood."
3795,2020-09-01 07:50:11,ikde7g,"I think this is referring to her first marriage where she was kind of a kept woman. He was twenty years older and  powerful in the music industry, and I think there are suggestions that he was psychologically abusive."
3796,2020-09-01 06:40:07,ikde7g,I think she‚Äôs had a lot of ‚Äúinebriated‚Äù appearances... but I mean... it‚Äôs not like male musicians don‚Äôt get away with doing that constantly. I don‚Äôt recall the last time I‚Äôve seen Ozzy or Snoop Dogg sober.
3797,2020-09-01 13:54:59,ikde7g,Why the down votes? People don‚Äôt like uncomfortable truths I guess.
3798,2020-09-01 14:01:44,ikde7g,">  most people didn't know the kind of person she is.

The President isn't most people.  He knew exactly the kind of person she was."

3802,2020-09-01 13:03:27,ikde7g,"I font care for Ellen one way or other but it had already been speculated by numerous sources before she appeared on Ellen‚Äôs show. 

If you have seen or followed Mariah for any point in her stardom you‚Äôd realize she is not forced to do anything. She‚Äôs the biggest diva around. She has only one angle she wants to be photographed or seen from."
3803,2020-09-01 13:33:08,ikde7g,"The person who walked off can get ahead by putting out their story first. Can't that work? They have PR gurus working for them full-time.

Yes, absolutely they should be able to grieve in private but this idea that it's not normal is pretty detrimental in my opinion. They're a lot more common than people think.

3810,2020-09-01 10:26:48,ikde7g,Shes a horrible person. This article is essentially ‚Äúellen makes fun of ellen‚Äù
3811,2020-09-01 19:39:23,ikde7g,"Funny you say that because its the whataboutism being praised over current events.

3814,2020-09-01 17:50:44,ikde7g,She said she was friends with trump that‚Äôs the issue that causes all these people to start attacking her and trying to dig up any dirt they could on her.

For reference, you can go back ten years and Adam Carolla (who I no longer listen to because he‚Äôs gone a little too far right politically for my taste) was saying she‚Äôs fake and a jerk on his podcast."
3820,2020-09-01 13:32:57,ikde7g,The work culture was toxic from the beginning she was always a trash human. Google all the shit her employees have said about her over all the years she has been on tv.
3821,2020-09-01 16:10:30,ikde7g,Ive been reading terrible things about her on Reddit since 2012. So I feel like she's just nasty and kinda sneaky.
3822,2020-09-01 20:06:19,ikde7g,I mean tbh it‚Äôs probably just a Reddit circle jerk that‚Äôs blown way out of proportion

3824,2020-09-01 18:17:47,ikde7g,She's been a mean awful person outside her show since at least 2008 writers strike times afaik. If not before that.
3825,2020-09-01 20:24:56,ikde7g,"I have no idea how these daytime shows are popular. Ellen and  wendy williams are the only ones i know about. Amd both are horrible imo. Wendy seems like a total psychopath..
At least maurys paternity tests are funny sometimes. 

Kelly ripa is the only tolerable talk show host i like."
3826,2020-09-04 05:52:41,ikde7g,I thought the same thing but she is just really good at what she does. I do amazing customer service but at home I'm an introverted asshole.
3827,2020-09-02 11:07:49,ikde7g,These mental gymnastics are exhausting. The truth is Ellen has always been a piece of shit and youre directly responsible for financing her bad behavior and enriching her.
3828,2020-09-01 19:31:29,ikde7g,Exactly what I was thinking. This should be further up.
3829,2020-09-01 20:31:40,ikde7g,"Ehh if that was the case, Why did she sign a two year extension on her contract little over a year ago. She has had plenty of opportunity's to step down with out penalty. She chooses more money each time."
3830,2020-09-01 20:33:02,ikde7g,She could have just let it come to an end at the end of last season but she renewed her contract again. It is all about the money.
3831,2020-09-01 17:47:50,ikde7g,iirc she hated the dancing bit and regretted ever doing it

3841,2020-09-01 13:37:53,ikde7g,"""Sanity"" aside, more than one of Mariah's staff have come forward to say she's abused and sexually harassed them. So she's not exactly a model for decency either.

Which is not a defense of anything Ellen did, but it does make it hard to be all that sympathetic to Mariah either. At best the situation is an asshole being an asshole to another asshole."

3848,2020-09-01 17:43:36,ikde7g,"People are happy to comment on other people's sanity and poke fun at it until it gets beyond a joke (like Britney shaved head meltdown was laughed at but now people are concerned) I can't even imagine the stress of being in the public eye and adding mental health issues to the mix is just plain dangerous, if people showed concern and support from the start instead of calling people crazy and judging their actions then it could help prevent a future public melt down. Celebs are humans with feelings too and honestly I think people don't take that into consideration enough when they're talking shit about someone they've never met on the internet"

3852,2020-09-01 18:10:57,ikde7g,"I mean, what does crazy mean to you?"
3853,2020-09-01 18:17:02,ikde7g,"As someone with a mental illness you should know not to call people crazy, especially women. It‚Äôs incredibly offensive. Her being diagnosed with bipolar makes it worse but if she wasn‚Äôt diagnosed it would still be shitty."
3854,2020-09-01 16:18:50,ikde7g,Empathy is beautiful and a wonderful thing. When was the last time Mariah was relevant in the news? She put this information out herself and now we‚Äôre all talking about her. I never suggested that her loss is something to not be disheartened about it‚Äôs extremely sad. At some point we have to understand this is all marketing. They ‚Äúcelebrities‚Äù go on Ellen to sale their product which is themselves . Ellen digs for dirt & gossip to keep daytime watchers since she is selling a product that is her show.
3855,2020-09-01 10:42:36,ikde7g,They‚Äôve got a dumb entertainer for a president no wonder people are at their wits end.
3856,2020-09-01 12:47:40,ikde7g,Exactly. Why can't I read about crazy rich people for ten minutes as a break from the whole country imploding? Distractions help people feel sane. That's all it needs to be.
3857,2020-09-01 10:37:08,ikde7g,I don't understand why people think this state is new. It has always been this way
3858,2020-09-01 21:57:56,ikde7g,I definitely agree it could affect her image and she would likely be worried about that. Wish it wasn‚Äôt that case.  I think so think authenticity and ‚Äúcelebrities as real people‚Äù is becoming more accepted or sought after these days though. I mean certain celebs have a following because of their ‚Äúreal ness‚Äù or their snap backs. And I see video compilations pretty often of ‚Äúactresses shutting down sexist questions‚Äù Or musicians.  Yay!
3859,2020-09-01 21:54:53,ikde7g,"I guess I‚Äôm generalizing about the other instances I see this in (normal people in daily life) and am applying it to Mariah‚Äôs situation. I read the body language of those people and it seems more a lack of confidence or conditioned expectation for us to be demure and keep the peace and excuse questions or statements that cross boundaries.

3887,2020-09-01 12:44:37,ikde7g,What did she do?
3888,2020-09-08 09:41:08,ikde7g,They‚Äôre obsessed with a handful of celebrities and it‚Äôs really redundant and annoying. I think most poster don‚Äôt even care. It‚Äôs just easy karma
3889,2020-09-01 11:40:51,ikde7g,"Not that I'm aware. But the hate for Ellen stemmed from people not liking her workplace as well, although in seeing here some anecdotes and personal testimonies about how she was rude to one person etc.

I mean, does that cancel out the good she's done though?"
3890,2020-09-01 09:58:58,ikde7g,"A lot of people have disliked her here before, maybe for actual reasons maybe just because of reverse circlejerking when she was more popular on reddit. I seem to vaguely remember some askreddit threads to the likes of 'have you met a celebrity and how did it go' where Ellen was mentioned in not that great of a light.


I believe some of those people from before might be doing this as an 'I told you so' now that some actual allegations of a toxic workplace have surfaced."
3891,2020-09-01 10:14:07,ikde7g,"Not sure why you're getting downvoted, would be nice if people actually replied to you instead.  But this topic of Ellen aside, I am noticing a hard parallel between cancel culture and pitchforks"
3892,2020-09-02 03:27:24,ikde7g,"Well not directly.

Imagine it this way. What if you go to a stranger's house and put your feet on the coffee table or dining table. Do you think the host would be offended with that action?

Andrew was uncomfortable with the line of questioning Ellen have gave him and has been telling her so quite clearly at that point and Ellen is still pushing it.

He can't really tell her to fuck off in front of live audience and national television on top of the fact that he's there to promote the movie.

So, that is how he expresses it with his body language. Whether it a deliberate or unconcious action, I'm not sure.

Well, someone can probably explain this better than me."
3893,2020-09-01 21:10:23,ikde7g,"No, but you can see in that moment that he's definitely visible irritated and having a little trouble keeping it together."
3894,2020-09-01 14:11:00,ikde7g,In a perfect world you shouldn't have to hide. But the world we live in isn't perfect and forcing someone to confront that before he/she is ready can be actually dangerous.
3895,2020-09-01 18:57:54,ikde7g,"You would think a gay woman who had massive pressure put on her for coming out on tv would empathize but alas, she‚Äôs too rich for that now."
3896,2020-09-01 21:21:06,ikde7g,I know you're gay now. I still love you. You're a good kid.
3897,2020-09-01 10:53:59,ikde7g,"Lol she did yeah, not sure why. I guess she still needed to promote her shit and Ellen just has the platform for it. Might have been more of a Manager/Agent decision rather than her desire to go back."
3898,2020-09-01 11:55:40,ikde7g,Money babay
3899,2020-09-01 15:23:04,ikde7g,She seems pretty professional and dedicated to her career so I can see her putting up with stuff like that if it helped her career.
3900,2020-09-01 14:25:00,ikde7g,I doubt she has the power to book her own appearances
3901,2020-09-01 11:40:05,ikde7g,Because she was definitely doing that as a publicity stunt and it wasn‚Äôt real crying.
3902,2020-09-01 16:04:26,ikde7g,Jamie was also being actually funny he wasn‚Äôt just bullying them like Ellen. And as soon as he realized that they were getting annoyed and not just embarrassed he saved it
3903,2020-09-01 15:46:10,ikde7g,It could be that they were less secret about it between the 3or do of them and he didn't know specifically
3904,2020-09-01 18:12:22,ikde7g,Oh please this is not a gender thing. Forcing a woman to reveal her pregnancy when she clearly doesn‚Äôt want to is shitty regardless.
3905,2020-09-01 14:37:40,ikde7g,"‚ÄúObjectifying‚Äù is socializing and revealing qualities of celebrities? Pregnant or dating?  On NATIONAL TV?

If going to watch Ellen show‚Äî- and expecting an artificial interview is your idea‚Äî-then getting mad they reveal DATING and PREGNANCY‚Äîyou‚Äôre a whole ton of confused to have gotten where you are.


How feeble and oversensitive you must be, to quantify mere Ellen (national tv) show as offensive to your holier than thou standards?  petty and pathetic.  Are you 600lbs?

Try limiting your worldview to your backyard if that‚Äôs too stressful for all you troglodyte ~~nonbinaries~~."
3906,2020-09-01 13:07:26,ikde7g,I only mentioned because you alluded to it. My take is the same. I judge on the current topic and not what anyone did previously to their dogs or nannies or whatever. This was a flagrant violation of privacy by Ellen. Doesn't matter who is on the other end or what their history is. It's irrelevant

I don‚Äôt mind other talk shows tbh. If they‚Äôre simply unfunny or cringey then I just don‚Äôt watch them. I wouldn‚Äôt say that the whole industry needs to die because of that."
3910,2020-09-01 11:35:54,ikde7g,This is actually true. But too much media culture thrives on it.
3911,2020-09-01 11:45:25,ikde7g,Two words. Keanu Reeves
3912,2020-09-01 12:16:53,ikde7g,"Agreed. I felt really bad when Colbert moved over to that. He'd had a really good show before then, and while he did have guests he was far more likely to bring on authors or politicians as a pretext to discuss legitimate matters with some degree of depth. Pretty much any comedian. It's a great gig for the money and exposure but it essentially means the end of any actual comedy. The last talk show with any real comedy in it was *The Larry Sanders Show*."
3913,2020-09-01 09:45:48,ikde7g,Right
3914,2020-09-01 22:51:45,ikde7g,"I don't think I am, your point is obvious. The double standard is not problematic because men aren't generally reduced to their looks and systematically fucked over by the industry. Ogling at Chris Pine is okay because he has all the opportunities to have a successful career until he's 70."
3915,2020-09-01 23:23:57,ikde7g,"I have things I want to do and it involves more than drinking pbr and living in a hovel. Finding a decent job gets your life in a better place.

But I do enjoy her earlier music. Can't say I enjoy anything about Trump though."
3920,2020-09-01 09:18:09,ikde7g,What? Trump pretends that he's an infallible paragon of virtue and winning.
3921,2020-09-01 08:34:10,ikde7g,"I never once heard Donald Trump admit he's a racist, sexist or an overall lying c\*nt."

3924,2020-09-01 17:34:34,ikde7g,"More like the Alex Jones defense. During a divorce hearing/custody he basically said he has 2 personalities. One sensationalized for his show, and the other"
3925,2020-09-01 08:48:59,ikde7g,Really? Even in a thread about Ellen Degeneres? Obsessed...
3926,2020-09-01 14:45:24,ikde7g,"Oh yes, the ‚ÄúI bitch about Trump constantly instead of developing a semi-interesting personality‚Äù redditor"
3927,2020-09-01 08:19:37,ikde7g,"She has openly spoken about having bipolar disorder. 

That said, that (nor BPD) doesn't necessarily immediately = asshole, and that sort of stigma is exactly why Mariah was, and others like her are, scared to get diagnosis and treatment."
3928,2020-09-01 16:12:18,ikde7g,"Bro ALL mom's do SOMETHING that will fuck up their kid in later life. This woman may have a slightly more extreme issue, but the fact is, she isn't actively abusing the kids. All people and kids can benefit from therapy. Try as I might, there is no avoiding it. If she is still teaching them balance, mental illness acceptance and love, that is literally all that matters."
3929,2020-09-02 17:03:41,ikde7g,"not sure why you would think that.... not all nannies are lifelong friends of children. Surely we can assume that MC told the kids the nanny had to leave for some normal reason.

I love all the hate I'm getting for my comment. I'm not defending MC's personality but it's become very clear that none of you have gone through a miscarriage."
3930,2020-09-01 11:19:40,ikde7g,You think being a nanny for a millionairess is a low paid job?
3931,2020-09-01 08:19:33,ikde7g,"To be fair it‚Äôs more than an embarrassment, it forced her to publicly live her miscarriage. That‚Äôs real pain.

That being said, yeah, the low wage worker losing her job is a serious thing that shouldn‚Äôt be downplayed because people act like working class people are expendable. 

Ellen and MC are both trash millionaires, fuck em."
3932,2020-09-01 12:03:46,ikde7g,"I seriously doubt Mariah Carey's nanny is a ""low wage worker"".  Celebrity nannies make like $150k/year on average."
3933,2020-09-01 08:22:09,ikde7g,as if being multi-millionaires doesnt make you human
3934,2020-09-01 12:30:04,ikde7g,"But for the nanny, she can now put on her resume: ""Cared for Mariah Carey's children"". And when asked why she was let go, the nanny can say, ""her kids love me too much!"""
3935,2020-09-02 17:02:16,ikde7g,"you think multi millionaires pay nannies minimum wage? 

and why does money have anything to do with this?"
3936,2020-09-01 18:20:21,ikde7g,"Cool, which one makes it ok to have her pregnancy made public without her permission? Lol"
3937,2020-09-01 16:36:31,ikde7g,I'm definitely leaning towards firing the nany after the children being attached to them being worse.
3938,2020-09-01 08:03:41,ikde7g,"Why? 

That's a genuine question as I'm wondering why it's a good look for anyone to act like that."
3939,2020-09-01 08:11:55,ikde7g,What an incredibly stupid and naive thing to say.
3940,2020-09-01 13:55:31,ikde7g,"Because the original comment relates to mothers ('women') and not parents.  Of course the same applies to both parents but more often than most, its the mom whos at home with the kids.  And no, im not knocking dads here."
3941,2020-09-20 03:23:27,ikde7g,"You should look things like this up rather than just believe a Reddit comment. She‚Äôs had to do that in the past because they have made themselves ‚Äúmore important than me (mariah)‚Äù she said. 

Now obviously that‚Äôs very different from ‚Äúkids love them too much‚Äù because it paints a situation where the nanny might be trying to undermine Mariah‚Äôs role as a mom, which would warrant changing a nanny. You don‚Äôt know the situation either so it‚Äôs best not to assume."
3942,2020-09-01 08:32:16,ikde7g,"She also says, if you read the article, that she explicitly said she doesn‚Äôt want to throw anyone under the bus. ‚ÄúI really have had a hard time grappling with the aftermath. I don‚Äôt want to throw anyone that‚Äôs already being thrown under any proverbial bus, but I didn‚Äôt enjoy that moment.‚Äù"

3944,2020-09-02 06:52:11,ikde7g,"It really was. I felt like I was watching an episode of The Office, but not funny. Which is ironic."
3945,2020-09-01 16:27:08,ikde7g,"Here's what's tough. There are very few television jobs that aren't gruelling. Generally the hours are long, expectations are high, and there's a lot of pressure. Almost all workplaces will have stories about someone losing their cool or not being nice, because people are tired and stressed. For talk shows, they have to deliver multiple times a week, which is no easy task. So it's never a question of - is this person nice 24/7? It's more like - are they generally a good boss who is under a lot of pressure to deliver, OR are they a bad boss who uses the pressure as an excuse to be terrible?

When it comes to a place like Reddit, if someone asks, ""Hey, does anyone have any bad stories about working for x?"" it's easy to cherry pick stories of late nights or work getting thrown out or things that are run-of-the-mill, working-in-entertainment bad.

So it's not that those places aren't difficult places to work. They *all* are. But in the industry, Ellen is known to be *particularly* bad."

3949,2020-09-01 17:26:14,ikde7g,"That I don't know. But I will say that the person I know who works for Colbert has worked there for a very long time (he moved from the Colbert Report to the current show), and has very nice things to say his experiences working there."

I will go back to Pokemon because I can enjoy a game while still being angry over current events in the US, since I'm not naive or foolish enough to think someone enjoying something or focusing on another issue means they don't care about this other issue."
3968,2020-09-01 16:49:31,ikde7g,She's one of 24 people that's able to consistently and accurately utilize 5 or more octaves while singing so I'd say that's a claim that's backed up and accepted in the music community...

3975,2020-09-01 15:17:17,ikde7g,"I never got Ellen. I'd watch clips and that'd be pretty much all I could sit through because she gave off such strong 'I'd rather be anywhere else' vibes. that, and the 'pranks' and her way of interviewing was way to mean for me to stomach. Even when she was doing giveaways or really cool stuff, she'd be like 'meh'. I just thought that was her brand of humor, which I didn't connect with, but looking back...maybe she was just genuinely miserable and because of that was a dick to other people. Doesn't excuse it AT ALL, but it makes me wonder what turned Ellen from the start of her talk show in 2003 to the POS she turned into later on.

I'm guessing Ellen had the case of being stuck and unable to leave...not just with her contract, but probably the uncertainty of whether or not she could succeed as much outside of her talk show and still achieve the level of fame she had with it. I guess in the end it bit her in the ass, but still. She should have sucked it up and ended the show earlier instead of making a career out of having her guests squirm. 

I'll never forget her and Dakota Johnson, though. One of the few guests that didn't sit there and sweat. She met her and coolly held her own. Props to her."

It is also related to people not staying out of a pregnant person‚Äôs business. Instead of accepting that the pregnant person is a responsible adult who has health goals based on the recommendations of their doctor people like to give unsolicited advice. Don‚Äôt drink coffee, don‚Äôt lift weights, no swimming, you shouldn‚Äôt be sitting so much, you shouldn‚Äôt be standing so much, you need to take this specific multi vitamin, you need to gain less weight, you need to gain more weight, etc."
3995,2020-09-01 17:39:03,ikde7g,"Yeah, Tommy Mottola pretty much groomed her and forced her to uphold a certain image for the longest time. Then when she divorced him, he sabotaged her new album by giving samples for it to Jennifer Lopez before the album could drop and blocking her long-time writing partner Walter Afanasieff from working with her. On top of all that, she had all this pressure from the studios to promote her movie Glitter round the clock, which ended up a critical and box office failure and coincidentally dropped around 9/11."

On the flip side, Americas Funniest Home Videos was the top show for decades, and people would laugh their asses off when someone would fall off a roof or a waterslide and land on their neck or break their leg.

4082,2020-09-01 21:07:13,ikde7g,I think they meant seeing her be nice on her TV show is not a good judge of her character.
4083,2020-09-02 15:49:06,ikde7g,Right. She has to a ‚Äúnice‚Äù host onstage. My reading leads me to believe that she is not always very nice backstage.
4084,2020-09-01 16:33:50,ikde7g,"Ah she would succeed. I'm not huge Ellen fan, and I never watched her show, but her old stand-up is really good. She had chops, I dunno whether she still does.."
4085,2020-09-01 16:19:08,ikde7g,I always disliked Ellen but never had any real evidence of her being a POS until I saw the Dakota Johnson interview
4086,2020-09-01 16:31:51,ikde7g,"IIRC after her stand up success she went downhill and was struggling to get back up again. Her tv show got cancelled for being ""too gay"" at the time so they offered her this talk show and made it that basically she had to be america's favourite gay woman, hence being as nice and amazing as possible.

Edit: To correct myself as others have pointed out, it didn't get cancelled for being ""too gay"" it she got kicked off for coming out of the closet as gay."
4087,2020-09-01 17:04:38,ikde7g,"Her humor and ""standup"" isn't that great either."
4088,2020-09-01 18:25:00,ikde7g,"I've always liked Ellen, because I liked her standup, but apparently rumors of her being horrible to people go all the way back to her sitcom in the 90s. Her personality predates her talk show."
4089,2020-09-02 17:25:28,ikde7g,"I'm assuming that a lot of you are too young to realize that once upon a time, in the very strange time called ""the 90s"" lol,  Ellen had a popular hit comedy sitcom, much like Friends or Seinfeld, but was fired and basically blackballed from television when she decided to publicly come out of the closet as a lesbian. People were terrible to her. Not just in Hollywood, but people on the opposite side of the television, in the comfort of their own homes, were disgusted and enraged by her own very personal lifestyle choice/right. 

When she was given that talk show, it was almost as if it were supposed to make up for all of that, as if society had forgiven her, when she should of been the one doing the forgiving. 

I don't know anything about what you all are talking about, but knowing what I saw as a child, how she was treated, and others in her position, she has every right to be ""bitter"" or ""angry""."
4090,2020-09-01 18:47:25,ikde7g,Yeah but a lot of industry people and former writers have all had complaints about her treatment of her writers room so hes in a chorus of voices about that
4091,2020-09-01 23:47:21,ikde7g,"> He's also a bit of a dick though, so I wouldn't be surprised if they just hated each other

I would imagine people who are dicks REALLY hate it when people are dicks back to them. They like the power of pushing people around and don't like it when others ""fight"" back."
4092,2020-09-01 16:29:18,ikde7g,"He and Dr. Drew were so ahead of their era back in the early 90s but time kind of passed them and Dr. Drew really disappointed me when he didn‚Äôt get on board with the dangers of COVID. It‚Äôs not like he was a quack like Dr. Phil, he was an Internist and got his start at USC medical."
4093,2020-09-01 19:09:22,ikde7g,I stopped listening around the time Alison got canned abruptly. She wasn‚Äôt amazingly funny or anything but he did her dirty and somehow got on an even higher horse once the story became a story. I was out after that

This is actually her being frustrated and snapping at the translator, so thank you for this!"
4101,2020-09-01 11:27:36,ikde7g,"Same happened when Psy of gamgnam style came over.

Ellen treated him like a dance monkey, he enters and she starts off by asking to show the dance.

Psy had to interrupt and ask if he can introduce himself first.

4103,2020-09-01 13:02:23,ikde7g,"that clip always makes my blood boil. ellen, who clearly only speaks one language, has no idea how translation from one language to another works. if your sentence in english has 6 words in it, it's not going to be 6 words in the translated language - plus the translator might have to explain things to give a better understanding of the question too since it might not always directly translate well. 

the poor girl looked so mortified doing her damn job!! she looks really young and it really is quite a feat to be that young and be able to seamlessly translate between languages. but ellen humiliates her for a few cheap laughs."
4104,2020-09-01 09:32:02,ikde7g,The thing I find equally disgusting about this clip is that the audience actually laugh at her and find it amusing
4105,2020-09-01 09:40:52,ikde7g,"Don't know how it really is over there. But judging by American movies/TV shows etc, it seems that for an American, foreign languages and accents really are the the funniest shit ever."
4106,2020-09-01 11:31:33,ikde7g,"I saw a part of her show with some kind of card magician as a guest and it was honestly kind of hilarious how little she cared about his shtick. 

He did a ""pick a card"" thing and she straight up says ""I guess this is the one your picking for me"" or something along those lines. Then when he's doing his audience work she's just scowling. lol"
4107,2020-09-01 11:48:52,ikde7g,"The full clip is even worse, damn. She's barely holding it together. You can tell she just doesn't want to be doing that interview. What a stupid idea for an interview generally"
4108,2020-09-01 14:00:09,ikde7g,"Apparently it's some sort of running gag with the translator, but how much the translator likes it I don't know.  
  My mom being a translator it kinda irks me that she keeps looking at the translator when asking questions when she isn't the one she is having a conversation with and then does this snapping gag."

4116,2020-09-01 12:50:32,ikde7g,I‚Äôm not trying to defend her but it seems like the joke she‚Äôs making is that she asked a simple question and the question in Taiwanese (?) was very long. You can see the translator didn‚Äôt pick up on that and it just got kinda awkward.
4117,2020-09-01 13:56:32,ikde7g,She was obviously joking. If any of reddit's more beloved talk show hosts made the same joke none of you would bat an eye.
4118,2020-09-01 12:26:59,ikde7g,And there is laugh at that same moment. That was awful.
4119,2020-09-01 12:57:52,ikde7g,Does anyone know what the translator was saying when Ellen cut her off? It really doesn‚Äôt matter but I‚Äôm just curious and it seems like she said a lot.

4133,2020-09-02 00:14:10,ikde7g,You don't think that was her just trying to keep the audience interested and keep it humorous during a segment that included a lot of foreign language the vast majority of her audience would not be following?
4134,2020-09-01 14:20:01,ikde7g,"I don't know. I could see this being justified. The translator is definitely not doing what you'd call a professional job of it, kind of flustered and stammering at first. And then that question she started asking was indeed super long, I can understand not wanting a translator to basically tell the kids what to answer, and thinking that might be what the girl was doing. Ellen's job is to make the guest interesting to the audience, and that's how this reads to me. With a little (too snarky) humor interjected into her attempt to corral the segment when it became more translation than interview.

I agree she did have a little more bite in her tone / expression than she needed, but people have a bad day occasionally. And this is still pretty reasonable compared to most people who lose their patience."

Fast forward to being an adult now... no it wasn‚Äôt fine and they were uncomfortable and secretly this woman with a warm and fuzzy persona can actually be really mean and bitchy.

When the story is written, it says something like *""Trump speaks from Rose Garden about the Dutch Resistance in WW2; calls for more NATO money from EU partners""*

Like theyre obviously still talented and funny, but they are also really rusty and dont have the energy or attention to work on their act long enough to make it something really special. Its not a rule, but it happens pretty often."
4204,2020-09-01 17:19:38,ikde7g,What happened with that interview?
4205,2020-09-01 17:14:37,ikde7g,"I don‚Äôt like the awful things she did to her employees, guests, audience members, etc. But she went through a lot of fucked up crap back then. 

I sorta liked her dry humor and it was a little novel to see a woman not fawning over children on television to me. I think if she had stayed in standup comedy, we would have been a little more forgiving of her glaring imperfections. But since the only place they opened up for her was America‚Äôs lovable bubbly woman talk show, we put the bar way higher than she would have ever placed it for herself. I sometimes see why she was resentful and generally bitter.

She could have stepped down at any time though, and I really don‚Äôt know why she didn‚Äôt especially after amassing so much wealth. But I also do feel for her, like many other female comedians, for dealing with that and having the big gay no-no stamp on her forehead."
4206,2020-09-01 19:28:44,ikde7g,"That‚Äôs not exactly how that went down. Her show was cancelled because she was gay, not because the show was ‚Äútoo gay‚Äù. Then she didn‚Äôt work in television for 10 years. In that 10 year stretch she went back to standup to pay her bills, during that time the lgbtq community put her on a pedestal that she didn‚Äôt want to be on and because of that she was given a talk show on a trial run where she was forced to present as family friendly for daytime. She talks in interviews about how in the early days of her talk show there would be discussions about making sure her wardrobe didn‚Äôt look too gay. She talks about it at length in a bunch of interviews."
4207,2020-09-01 18:14:47,ikde7g,"She started doing the talkshow years after her sitcom died. That ended in 1998 and, she had a second sitcom that lasted one season in 2001. Talk show started in 2003. Basically they wanted a replacement for Rosie when she stepped down."
4208,2020-09-02 17:36:08,ikde7g,"The show was super popular, I remember, I used to watch it with my mom. I believe Jeremy Piven was in it, not sure who else. It was a hit. The show wasn't pro gay or anything of the sort, nobody had any idea she was gay until she decided to tell America. A very different America then it is now, even though people will act like that's not the case."
4209,2020-09-02 19:01:58,ikde7g,"I get that she had a really shit time, but I don't think that gives her the right to teach others - especially those who work for her and those who she invites on her show - as she did.

4221,2020-09-01 16:32:34,ikde7g,The joke Ellen was making was referring to the translated English being noticeably longer than her question. It was obviously in jest.
4222,2020-09-01 15:17:42,ikde7g,"Oh come on, it's obviously just a joke - you've seen it in movies and tv shows  before where someone says something very short and has it translated using many words - or the opposite - where someone makes a long complicated speech only for the translator to say three or four words. It's a joke.

Ellen may or may not be a total bitch behind the scenes - I have no idea - but much of this stuff of picking clips from her show is confirmation bias and misrepresentation.

Like that bit with the woman who took more than one item off that table - the woman was an actress hired for the role.

The Mariah Carey thing was pretty shitty and unwise, though, and did come across as a desperate attempt to get an 'exciting exclusive' for the TV show without thought Carey."
4223,2020-09-01 11:37:20,ikde7g,"It‚Äôs not though.  At all.  She is a veteran comedian and actor. While this is obviously not many people‚Äôs idea of funny especially when it involves a kid who clearly can‚Äôt understand, she is 100% joking and trying to make an otherwise drawn out boring portion (the translation) into something interesting.   Much of what comedy is is just trying to be funny, taking chances, throwing things out there.  They don‚Äôt all work.  This is an example of people being too sensitive and wanting to be offended or outraged."

You know laughing at how long the translation was vs the original question.


So laughing would be normal.




When she continued however, you could see the that it was no joke."
4237,2020-09-01 13:33:06,ikde7g,I mean laughing at something awkward or uncomfortable is also a pretty normal reaction.
4238,2020-09-01 10:30:22,ikde7g,"To be fair, the audience at any of these shows is the lowest of the low. Oprah, Ellen, Dr. Phil, whatever else. These people would clap if someone came on stage and shot one of them in the head."

4240,2020-09-01 13:19:57,ikde7g,Her whole Sofia Vergara Maybelline partnership campaign became Ellen making fun of Sofia‚Äôs heavy accent. Sofia can be a good sport but you can def tell when she‚Äôs had enough
4241,2020-09-01 10:54:01,ikde7g,"It‚Äôs weird because in real life there are people with accents everywhere and people are usually polite and trying to understand them. Sometimes you can‚Äôt understand someone who doesn‚Äôt speak English well, just like with any language, so I wonder if the reason it‚Äôs in tv shows and movies so much is because of people‚Äôs internalized frustrations with not being able to understand someone‚Äôs accent, and then these jokes are made in tvs and movies and people get their frustrations out about dealing with immigrants and such, but it ends up being a negative feedback loop, because they end up thinking it‚Äôs ok to make fun of peoples accents behind their back by laughing at the jokes about it on tv, and it ended up being this long running theme, and it just goes on forever and became part of the culture that you do behind people‚Äôs backs or on tv/in the movies, which was never a positive, accepting way to deal with people, but comedians kept getting laughs for it."
4242,2020-09-01 11:36:35,ikde7g,"Many Americans say they speak American. They're also convinced that American is the hardest language to learn.

Second, since he's been elected I think there have been times where they went too far to give him the benefit of the doubt so that they look less partial.

4288,2020-09-01 19:06:48,ikde7g,Ellen doesn‚Äôt fawn over children? Are you kidding?
4289,2020-09-01 23:22:30,ikde7g,That is an interesting view on it i didn't really consider.
4290,2020-09-02 00:09:53,ikde7g,"""it was a little novel to see a woman not fawning over children on television to me.""

I understand what you are saying that it's refreshing that she did something more than just be relegated to fawning over children, definitely women need to get to do more things and contribute in other ways and use our full range of talents, that's incredibly important but fawning over children (or the poor or women or whoever is lower status) is nothing to look down on or sneer at (even if you are a childfree person, which is a valid choice if people don't want that, I don't feel I can force that on people). We should all (especially men) be fawning over children more. It's not feminism or women's liberation that women don't fawn over children anymore (instead men should join us and fawn over children too!, rather than when a man fawns over a kid people feel that he can only have ulterior motives). Feminism is about equality including removing the adult child hierarchy and having equality with children.

Men may have women fawning over children or thinking that's all we can/should do thinking that it's a low status thing to do and it's a way of putting women down but taking care of the little people is a very honourable and ""noble"" thing to do. Just because some men have that perspective that does not mean we have to also agree with them. And we can have our liberation without abandoning the little folk.

Actually I think it is a very feminist thing to fight for the children/girls especially. Women may not have much control over how men treat us but we can control how we treat those with less power than us like children. Taking care of the children and fighting for the children is one of the strongest ways of doing feminism.

I understand that women don't want to be relegated to be only doing that and society functions best when men also learn to take care of the little people and women can contribute in every field but I really hate to see what often seems like disparaging being patient and kind to children being equated with feminism. I'm basically as feminist as they come and that's not my idea of feminism."

I realize coming out as gay in the 90s couldn‚Äôt of been easy, esp going mainstream, but to me it seems like she‚Äôs been riding a wave of popularity regarding her being a marginalized as gay and a woman rather than her talent as a comedian.

Did Ellen just actually blindside her and her team? In that case that's like, twice the violtion in a sense that it also crossed that unspoken Hollywood rule although obviously the privacy boundary it crossed was a much bigger offense.

And if it was an ambush I feel like Ellen also might well have jeopardised the career of someone in Mariah's team, like they could have been fired for it you know?"

I'm assuming that a lot of you are too young to realize that once upon a time, in the very strange time called ""the 90s"" lol,  Ellen had a popular hit comedy sitcom, much like Friends or Seinfeld, but was fired and basically blackballed from television when she decided to publicly come out of the closet as a lesbian. People were terrible to her. Not just in Hollywood, but people on the opposite side of the television, in the comfort of their own homes, were disgusted and enraged by her own very personal lifestyle choice/right. 

When she was given that talk show, it was almost as if it were supposed to make up for all of that, as if society had forgiven her, when she should of been the one doing the forgiving. 

I don't know anything about what you all are talking about, but knowing what I saw as a child, how she was treated, and others in her position, she has every right to be ""bitter"" or ""angry""."

I think it just didn't pick up steam. That particular manager had spawned a dozen or so articles about Mariah after she got fired, so it was probable that the sexual harassment case did not stand out. Media coverage during #MeToo also preferred to focus on male celebrities who had a wider circle of influence (in contrast Mariah's team is very insular)."

There‚Äôs a constant influx of Front Page people sharing their girlfriends, wives, boyfriends, LOTS of husbands, and overall families + pets. I do NOT see this on 4chan, rather I see this most on Facebook. I think there‚Äôs more evidence to show that Reddit has gotten MUCH more ‚Äúnormie‚Äù then it was."

4399,2020-09-01 16:18:39,ikde7g,Well you mentioned misogyny and tbh it's kind of easy to take pot shots based on a woman's appearance. Her character and actions already show how bad she is.
4400,2020-09-01 14:50:55,ikde7g,Wait I meant it the other way around. I thin Wendy is far worse than Ellen. Sorry for the confusion.

Making the wrong call either way is likely to piss off the client so you really don't want to get ut wrong, and every client has different needs so there's no universal rule but if no one tells you otherwise you're supposed to translate everything exactly, no omissions. Ultimately, this is why you hire a trained translator and not a child who happens to speak the language. But clients are often cheap jerks like DeGeneres."
4420,2020-09-01 18:10:02,ikde7g,It's correct but you can tell she translated it word for word from english in her brain first which is why she took a second. I think a better translation would be Èô§‰∫ÜÂêâ‰ªñ‰Ω†Ëøò‰ºö‰ªÄ‰πà‰πêÂô®.

When it‚Äôs time to laugh or applaud they want you to bring it x10 but no too long, the show is only 30-40 mins and they want you outta the studio.
Overall great experience but that part was just was surreal.

Edit: there had to be an audience director to tell them to react /laugh on cue."

4445,2020-09-04 08:55:30,ikde7g,"That's my point, though. When a male victim came forward about a female perpetrator, right in the middle of a media frenzy about celebrities sexually harassing and abusing others, it got minimal mention for like a day. The coverage of Mariah for the rest of the week was about her cancelling a show because she had a sore throat, and breaking up with her boyfriend.

When a female victim filed a suit some months later, that got a little more traction, but Mariah still didn't get anything like the public scorn that male celebrities got.

Hard to believe it's really about the behavior when female abusers get a pass."

4456,2020-09-02 04:33:43,ikde7g,"Jealousy and pettiness came out in that interview.  They both have a brand of comedy which distances themselves from those around them, which is why people consider Seinfeld elitist or whatnot.  However what he does that is successful in this is that his position of ""observer"" in the comedy routine is exploratory and we laugh at the absurdity of what is considered normal behavior.  Ellen just sets herself apart like a mean girl and mocks people.  It was hard to enjoy her comedy imho."
4457,2020-09-02 04:28:58,ikde7g,"I've met some online and in person, they think he's a smug asshole or that his humor is elitist completely ignoring the fact that he worked his way to success.  It really beats me why they have issues with him."

4461,2020-09-01 20:17:07,ikde7g,It works in reverse too. A complicated sentence written out in English would often turn out to be a single character or two in Chinese.
4462,2020-09-01 15:28:24,ikde7g,"I think it was harder for people to notice that Ellen is actually mean because it was believed that she was a really good person.  Everyone assumed the best even in these situations.  Oh she's just being funny.

IANAL, but I‚Äôm pretty sure the video would be protected by copyright law under the category of ‚Äútransformative works‚Äù and ‚Äúfair criticism.‚Äù Idk that it could be considered libel if it‚Äôs simply made up of existing clips of Ellen being rude with the audience removed. That‚Äôs not stating anything definitively that could be considered libelous. It‚Äôs just presenting content for the audience to judge for themselves. As long as none of the clips are altered to represent Ellen in a more negative light than the clip originally did. Things like editing different clips together in a particular order to produce a certain effect. I wouldn‚Äôt think simply removing the laugh track would qualify as that.

But I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if that rubs certain people the wrong way, especially if they have some kind of preconceived notions about Conan before meeting him. Like they want to get into some deep philosophical conversation, and he‚Äôll just shut them down and ridicule them because they‚Äôre not a philosopher, they play a comic book character or tv or something. 

I don‚Äôt think it comes from a place of malice though, I think he‚Äôs just aware of how pointless the Ego can be and so beats up on people‚Äôs egos who he thinks could use a little downsizing. At the end of the day he‚Äôs trying to get you to laugh at yourself which is actually a good thing."

4515,2020-09-04 09:15:27,ikde7g,"Yup, I've seen more resistance to the idea of female perpetrators than to the idea of male victims. It's why I think male-on-male abuse is more acknowledged than female-on-female abuse. The day I see widespread coverage about a woman in media sexually assaulting another woman will be an interesting one.

What little we can be grateful for is that these issues are at least talked about more openly in the modern media circus. Terry Crews wouldn't have gotten the same reception if it had been 1997 instead of 2017."

People from the USA call themselves American because they are from the United States of *America*. It's right there in the name. Kinda like how people are also from the Republic of *China*."

Even on her death bed, he face timed her and made sure to tell her all about Q shit. While she just tried to say she loves him and hopes God will be with him when she's gone... 

I'm so sorry you're going through this, OP. It takes good people away from reality. It makes me so sad how she doesn't care how that might affect an 11 year old. I feel like my brother might have cried if he heard that... 

I wonder if Q people know how much others are grieving over people they love being lost to it. I wonder, if they would just explain that away too. It's like actual connection and love doesn't matter anymore. It's us vs. them in their minds, fighting an invisible war they think everyone is a part of. I wonder if they know that nobody sees them as a ""soldier"", but more an ambiguous loss."

Ever since our HONORABLE President ran for office, she has fallen into the rabbit hole. My Opa is a huge conservative. He talked all sorts of shit about minorities and made comments about my friends because they weren‚Äôt white. He thinks gay people are degenerates and that liberal professors are indoctrinating students into socialism. He likes Rush Limbaugh and Fox News. He was able to get my liberal family members on the Trump train.

Whatever humanity that I remember out of my family and friends is gone, replaced by fascism and far right rhetoric. I can‚Äôt even trust my co-workers. They may have accepted QAnon. They are all Trump supporters. I have to keep a cool head whenever they talk about Kyle‚Äôs heroism and how Democrats are running child sex cults.

I have no family. I have nobody to talk to except my partner. She understands the pain we go through. 

Fascism is the plan and groups like QAnon are leading us all down the primrose path.

The organizations ‚Äî¬†churches, parties, social circles ‚Äî¬†that are most committed to Q have also been in my experience least willing to actually hold pedophiles in their midst accountable. 

You want to talk about satanic? THAT'S satanic.

I'm speaking in a purely biblical sense, so my apologies to the church of Satan or whatever. But Satan is depicted in Scriptures variously as an angel of light (who looks righteous but is really evil), a purveyor of seductive yet destructive ""secret knowledge"" the acquisition of which will set one free, an accuser, a deceiver and ""The Slanderer.""

If there's a movement in American society that fits the biblical picture of satanic, it's these Q assholes."

The whole thing allows you to openly hate on Jews, Muslims and any other minority you can think of without any repercussions, or allow you a 'defensible' position from which to try and wind back the clock to the 1950s."

In front of a bunch of teenagers and children, she started screaming at the top of her lungs about pedophiles, how Obama is a satanist, how the Clintons eat kids brains, etc., and my cousin had to grab her children (who were 6 and 8 at the time) and rush them out of the room because they were both crying.

The worst part is, my aunt went through a divorce recently and is living with my cousin and her daughters, who are currently homeschooled.  I guarantee every time my cousin leaves the room, my aunt starts barfing this nonsense in their ears to try and ""save them"" from this made up paranoid delusion she has.

PS: I looked up that Ramen Fury game and it looks pretty fun!  Seems to play a lot like Sushi Go, which I'd definitely recommend, it's a ton of fun and kids learn it really quick because it's super simple and each game usually is only 15-20 minutes so they don't get bored."

My mother thinks that with age she's earned the right to say whatever she wants because that's what her father did.  She seems to forget that she hated a lot of stuff he said."

4559,2020-09-01 03:44:53,ikajuj,"Instead of facing what Trump really is, and the irreparable damage his voters have done to our country, they've retreated into fantasy where everything he does is magical, honest and heroic. They're not emotionally equipped or mature enough to handle being so wrong about something or someone they've poured so much faith into, and they've chosen to just deny and disbelieve the truth that's been staring them (and all of us) dead in the face for 3.5+ years now.

As Trump's behavior gets worse and more corrupt, the accusations against his opponents have to get more extreme and terrible so Trump can always be the lesser of two evils. They've decided that living in dream is somehow going to be less painful for them than taking any actual personal responsibility for the man they voted for."

But I'm never again spending Christmas with my brother-in-law, who has never done a thing to protect kids (and in fact defends the church and Christian school we both grew up in, which has tried to cover up multiple instances of very real child sexual abuse) but likes to spout nonsense about fake pedophile rings."

I do see truth in the fact that they are engaging in magical thinking, though. They genuinely believe their engagement, or even their opinions, can control an outcome. This isn't restricted to Trump or political beliefs, though. 

Q is definitely tied to Trump and he's their idol, but there will be many idols and many villains. I don't think people believe in Q because they were wrong about Trump, I think they want to feel like they have some type of control. They can't fix anything in this country, but then Q tells them to use a hashtag and suddenly they're soldiers with a higher purpose. Suddenly, they have the power. And Trump is the hype man saying ""HELL YEAH AMERICA!!!!"""
4580,2020-09-01 11:44:15,ikajuj,"Yep this Q shit is all rationalizations and delusions. The immutable fact in their belief system is that Trump is good and they are right. Hence they have to come up with a narrative to explain why Trump is actually secretly a badass and QAnon is premade bullshit for that. Basically it is the political equivalent of trying to understand the meaning of tea leaves. Trump is so crazy that it requires insane leaps of logic to rationalize it away. As things in the country get worse the rationalizations and delusions are getting more intense, so much so it requires maintaining essentially a fantasy.  One of the things that makes people want to rationalize Trump's behaviors is because he is so polarizing. Supporters constantly have to defend his behavior which actually paradoxically makes their belief stronger, they get further wedged into a tribe of fellow Trumpians.

But ya overall this whole thing is textbook delusion and rationalization. The human capacity for self-delusion is infinite. Like seriously infinite. A bottomless well of shit."

I‚Äôm used to him latching onto insane things like this, but Q has been the longest lasting. Christmas was hard enough, I didn‚Äôt need or want to hear about child sacrifices (or frankly anything political)."
4582,2020-09-01 05:43:07,ikajuj,"Thank you so much for sharing this story - I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. 

The more I read about QAnon and all the other nutball conspiracy theories out there, the clearer it is that a huge part of their adoration for Trump is that he's willing to feed into their delusional thinking. Whether he's as credulous a mook as he seems to be is debatable, but it's a sure bet that crazy LOVES reinforcement. They'll walk through live coals for him because he validates their fear and hate based worldview."
4583,2020-09-01 07:20:19,ikajuj,"These chimps believe that Beyonce' and Jay-Z are in the illuminati. There's even one of them that thinks that Beyonce' is not even black, she's italian. Yeah, I know, it's dumb."
4584,2020-09-01 04:41:18,ikajuj,I sympathize. I just get so angry when I think about the ridiculous theories these people choose to believe and how it affects the lives of their loved ones. I hope you get through to your mother.
4585,2020-09-01 13:11:22,ikajuj,"Her lack of tact sounds infuriating. I wish these Q people would leave their muddy boots at the door instead of traipsing it all over the house. Not every situation needs a conversation about paedophiles, oddly enough."
4586,2020-09-01 09:17:47,ikajuj,Such a terrible situation demonstrates just the level of cult-think that is part-n-parcel of this Q nonsense.
4587,2020-09-01 04:13:43,ikajuj,"Yeah, there's probably some of both. Some people just can't handle how far America has fallen in such a short time and they just don't want to believe it. Just giving in to the easy fantasy, where everything is still just fine and normal, is more comfortable to them than worrying about a Trump dictatorship and mobocracy.

But you're right, some segment of it is maybe a more apolitical and general denial of reality. A lot of the very same people call climate change a hoax because the problem is just too overwhelming and scary for them to face. 

All that does is the let problem fester until it's catastrophic, it doesn't just go away. That's basically what the Republicans in the Senate have done to our country, let Trump fester until this point where he's just unhinged and legitimately dangerous. That's what Trump did with Covid-19. He ignored it until it exploded across the country and killed close to 200,000 people and counting. 

This form of governance and leadership is suicidal."
4588,2020-09-01 11:55:07,ikajuj,"Great analogy! Everything you said is spot on.

The more they defend Trump's actions, the more committed they become. When do you finally say, ""enough"" after you forgave everything else?

It's almost like a drug addict making excuses for why they can't quit."
4589,2020-09-01 14:26:04,ikajuj,">Christmas was hard enough, I didn‚Äôt need or want to hear about child sacrifices (or frankly anything political).

I hear you. It's exhausting. For the first time ever, I literally hung up on my brother yesterday. He's not a Qvert ‚Äî¬†yet ‚Äî but is a strong Trump supporter who likes to pretend that he's open minded. Everything is, ""Well, yes, but you really have to look at who's behind the Black Lives Matters organization..."" I've told him a thousand times, ""Look, I don't want to talk about this with you."" I think I've begun the hang-up-the-phone-don't-answer-texts phase of our relationship."

Thankfully my husband is of the same mind frame as me. But it‚Äôs not his family that‚Äôs involved in it, so I don‚Äôt want to vent to him.  My brother, it‚Äôs all about him. For example for a milestone birthday of mine he wanted to buy us a nice dinner. He booked it at a place near his house (hour drive for us each way) and invited his friends (not mine). The dinner was about him, his friends (most of whom I didn‚Äôt know personally) and of course they were all Trump supporters and yes all they did was sing trumps praises. That‚Äôs a perfect example of who my brother is."

4593,2020-08-31 20:38:38,ik5xso,I mean people who have worked for her have been coming out and saying she‚Äôs a bad person for years along with restaurant servers and anyone who had the misfortune to cross her path. Anybody who watched her show has seen the mean shit she does to people.
4594,2020-08-31 20:34:38,ik5xso,"For sure. There are so many testimonials coming out from people who have nothing to gain by saying what they're saying... plus, there are a lot of clips of her being weird/passive aggressive with her talkshow guests. 

When you put 2 and 2 together, it seems pretty clear."
4595,2020-08-31 20:32:20,ik5xso,What did I miss?
4596,2020-08-31 20:40:41,ik5xso,"So I don‚Äôt know 100% sure, the only way you can claim that is if you see it personally. Right? But what we are going for is reasonably sure. 

I‚Äôve never met her. That‚Äôs a minus. I‚Äôve watched recordings of her show where she seemed to enjoy making her guest(s) uncomfortable or even crossed boundaries. That‚Äôs...bad. It seems she ran a show staff rife with sexual harassment(assault too? I forget) and lots of verbal and professional abuse. That‚Äôs also a strike. 

Over all? I think it‚Äôs believable and warrants further closer looks. But this is a TV show. Execs either cancel it or don‚Äôt. Seems they cancelled it. So that‚Äôs that. She‚Äôs likely at minimum the kind of person who thinks ignoring other people‚Äôs comfort boundaries makes for good TV and is a-ok to do. That alone makes her a terrible person."

Investigations are still ongoing and I don't want draw conclusions nor forget all the good things Ellen Degeneres did.
4611,2020-09-01 03:39:48,ijwlcb,"I'm not really quite interested in this whole debacle, but honestly whether or not she's LGBT should have no bearing or relevance to unrelated judgements. The problems people have with her are her own and not representing the LGBT community."

I‚Äôve heard some of her producers were involved in abuse, but she was also involved."

4634,2020-10-09 02:22:50,j7nxac,"Answering this kind of depends on one factor:

Are we considering actors who were expected to have greater careers than they actually had, or ones whose careers rapidly ended?

In Heche's case, she's been rather active as a performer- it's just that it's been on a string of television series, rather than in films.

In the case of the latter, Klinton Spilsbury is the classic example, as his film career ended as a result of very bad publicity regarding both his role in *The Legend of the Lone Ranger* (in particular, how he needed to be dubbed) and the film overall (such as its treatment of Clayton Moore)."
4635,2020-10-09 04:31:56,j7nxac,Naw. Heche had a mental breakdown. She also married a costar then started slagging him publicly. There is a very uncomfortable Letterman interview out there.  She's not a good person.

Super hot in the late nineties with Mummy movies and a few others and then...well, he spoke out against Hollywood and their predatory practices related to young kids and they black balled him for a long time. Good to see him out there again though. Rick Moranis also springs to mind, but his walk away was willing because he wanted to be with his family. And I know he has a show now in the Orville and is on TV as a voice actor, but Seth MacFarlane. A million ways to die in the west was such a waste of opportunity, but it sort of killed him on the upswing from Ted. That movie had the potential for so many more jokes and fun."

4686,2020-10-07 06:56:44,j6lvx8,Probably the lack of a live audience. She really needs them to sell the show.
4687,2020-10-07 06:42:52,j6lvx8,Slightly related: every time I go to Walmart I see a life-size photo of Ellen DeGeneres wearing skinny jeans and she's facing away from the camera with her head peeking over her shoulder. Needless to say it may not be prompting many people to buy those particular jeans.
4688,2020-10-07 12:47:47,j6lvx8,"See honestly? I think ‚Äútalk shows‚Äù are dying off anyway. They are such an outdated concept now especially with all the content online and available on internet connected TVs. 

Let it die, it‚Äôs all just static noise and fake reactions anyway."
4689,2020-10-07 13:51:18,j6lvx8,"If that dumb bitch Wendy williams can keep a show, ellen's show probably isn't going anywhere."
4690,2020-10-07 06:39:41,j6lvx8,Good.
4691,2020-10-07 06:39:37,j6lvx8,It‚Äôs nice to see there are still consequences for being a horrible person.
4692,2020-10-07 12:28:32,j6lvx8,Good. Fuck Ellen. She's not even funny.
4693,2020-10-07 15:00:49,j6lvx8,"Thank god, maybe now they‚Äôll cancel this garbage"
4694,2020-10-07 14:31:12,j6lvx8,"I needed a dog bed, and happened to be at Kohls the other day doing an Amazon return. They had some nice ones that were on sale, but on inspection they were all Ellen brand. Hard pass."
4695,2020-10-07 07:08:26,j6lvx8,Best news I've heard in a long time
4696,2020-10-07 11:45:00,j6lvx8,"The ultimate victory for the employees is the show being cancelled.

That‚Äôll teach her."
4697,2020-10-07 11:36:06,j6lvx8,"I never understood the appeal of this vanilla Nosferatu in the first place.

Being a toxic bitch aside, she was just never funny in the first place. Here's an actual joke of hers:

""I don't understand the sizes anymore. There's a size zero, which I didn't even know that they had. It must stand for: 'Ohhh my God, you're thin.""

Holy shit, call the paramedics I may rupture something from laughing so hard. 

On top of being apparently a horrible bitch and about as funny as Walmart get well soon card, her entire format is toxic as well. It's for Hallmark watching, bored midwestern housewives who when they aren't watching her show are collecting cat calendars. It's the same glorification of celebrities with interviews about as appealing and thought provoking as genital warts that make any sensible human being wince upon viewing. She is full of hypocrisy and pretends to be this do gooder and feel good persona when we now know that is anything but the truth. She's basically the Wendy Williams for white people. 

Talking about gossip no one should actually give a fuck about, pretending to be a humanitarian for the sake of cameras and ratings, stupid party games, lame corn fed humor and an ego lamer than Larry Flynt's cock.

Her receiving this well deserved backlash is one of the few good things to come out if this year."
4698,2020-10-07 15:51:22,j6lvx8,I remember when she embarrassed the crap out of an audience member for taking an extra ‚Äúfree souvenir‚Äù. The most awkward 5 minutes.
4699,2020-10-07 09:08:34,j6lvx8,"Good. Bye, bitch."
4700,2020-10-07 15:16:38,j6lvx8,"I wonder how long Kelly Clarkson‚Äôs contract with NBCUniversal is, I‚Äôve seen her show a few times and I think she‚Äôs probably the best show in daytime talk shows right now. I wonder if Warner would try to snag her as the next in line as their anchor daytime talk show if Ellen can‚Äôt recover"
4701,2020-10-07 16:32:31,j6lvx8,I‚Äôve had many supervisors and all know what‚Äôs going on in the workplace.  Some choose to act and correct and others turn a blind eye. Depends on the supervisor.  Ellen dropped the ball on this one and unfortunately hurt lots of people
4702,2020-10-07 16:43:32,j6lvx8,Are we still talking about this? I feel like I‚Äôve seen this headline for months now.
4703,2020-10-07 22:19:52,j6lvx8,She really should do her little dance thing and bipity Bobity the fuck off stage
4704,2020-10-07 14:40:31,j6lvx8,"People are outraged for all the wrong reasons. Ellen is not an exception. She is the rule of Hollywood. Most of Hollywood are phone, fake, lying snakes who will do anything for fame and money, but people worship their feet and buy their acts."
4705,2020-10-07 19:01:21,j6lvx8,"Is it weird to anyone that there has been ZERO word from her on this, just everyone believing everything else?"
4706,2020-10-07 07:07:13,j6lvx8,"Couldn't happen to a nicer lady.  Sadly, I'm sure she has enough money to just go away and live comfortable the rest of her miserable existence."
4707,2020-10-07 17:10:21,j6lvx8,"Good. I always hated her. One time, she had a celebrity guest who wouldn‚Äôt say if she was pregnant, so Ellen offered her alcohol. The celebrity, being a good mother, declined, and Ellen exposed her on live TV."
4708,2020-10-07 15:09:07,j6lvx8,"I‚Äôve honestly never understood how people watched her show, and liked her. It‚Äôs obvious she‚Äôs a narcissistic biotch."
4709,2020-10-07 13:27:40,j6lvx8,"Promoting your dj won't solve your toxic work environment, ya bitch."

4711,2020-10-07 17:55:17,j6lvx8,Great!  Now let‚Äôs do Dr. Phil.
4712,2020-10-07 19:11:48,j6lvx8,Why isn't the white house having the same issue?
4713,2020-10-08 03:34:06,j6lvx8,"Honestly, I never liked her.  Something about how she carried herself and treated her guests on her show.  Just so disingenuous and sarcastic in a mean girl kind of way.  It all makes sense now that it comes out that she‚Äôs actually a jerky McJerk face."
4714,2020-10-08 05:28:11,j6lvx8,"When your brand is, ""Be nice to everyone"" and it turns out that you're a toxic cunt to everyone, it tends to have a negative effect on your ratings. Go figure."
4715,2020-10-08 10:35:31,j6lvx8,Can we just get rid of her show and any more news about her. She‚Äôs by the wayside as they call it.
4716,2020-10-07 17:12:48,j6lvx8,"Ah, another 10k+ karma post about Ellen being kind of mean... now, in fairness, it's been at least a few weeks since the last one, but I'll still never understand this subs obsession with this minor scandal about a minor public figure.

This is just one of dozens of posts on the subject, all of which got thousands of upvotes, which offered virtually no new information.  It's not some ongoing scandal where new information is slowly dripping in... in fact, there was a virtually identical post made two months ago about low ratings.

It's just bizarre to me.  Lots of people are assholes, and lots put on a positive public front.  It's a mildly interesting anecdote as best."
4717,2020-10-07 16:02:09,j6lvx8,Good. Cancel that awful show.
4718,2020-10-07 15:28:57,j6lvx8,The one thing that bugs me about Ellen is how sexually inappropriate she is with her guests. Fucking disgusting.
4719,2020-10-07 15:56:45,j6lvx8,"Love a happy ending. 

The way she tried to shrug it off was ridiculous."
4720,2020-10-07 14:12:02,j6lvx8,Moral of the story: Don't be a cunt
4721,2020-10-07 15:55:38,j6lvx8,"Too much schadenfreude in this thread for me. I‚Äôm at work so I don‚Äôt watch daytime tv, but the reaction in this post from people who don‚Äôt work for her or know anyone who works for her seems WAY over the top.  Some of you are cursing her name like she did something to you personally. 

Daytime TV host is difficult boss. Oh."

4725,2020-10-07 21:01:26,j6lvx8,Hooray!
4726,2020-10-07 21:13:51,j6lvx8,This is great news.

4728,2020-10-07 21:24:08,j6lvx8,Good
4729,2020-10-07 23:20:00,j6lvx8,She must really love her job to stay after all that backlash
4730,2020-10-07 23:53:21,j6lvx8,All i know is why wife stopped watching and DVRing Ellen and the both of us stopped watching and DVRing Game of Games.  She can go fuck herself.

4734,2020-10-07 16:34:52,j6lvx8,"Typical Hollywood hypocrite. Couldn‚Äôt care less about this garbage human or what happens to her. Save the bullshit apologies, Ellen. No one cares about you anymore."
4735,2020-10-07 14:02:20,j6lvx8,"I never watched a lot, but I did notice she really got a kick out of scaring the absolute shit out of her guests.  I always thought she was a bit of a sicko to be like that."
4736,2020-10-07 17:38:37,j6lvx8,Good bye Ellen you two faced pos
4737,2020-10-07 19:13:07,j6lvx8,Good. Shes not funny and her show is extremely cringe.

4740,2020-10-07 14:11:31,j6lvx8,"Her staff wants to be her friend and not just a worker.  They more than likely went to work for her thinking she's some super nice person,  which she might be,  but the amount of energy that gets drained for you doing that show and putting on that happy energy,  when you get off set you might not want to talk to anyone or tend to blow up when someone doesn't do their job correctly."
4741,2020-10-07 14:39:00,j6lvx8,"What is more important, a well made and entertaining show or how happy the staff are or nice someone is off-air?  I'd bet every show you like has unhappy staff."

4752,2020-10-07 15:16:16,j6lvx8,I gotta imagine her non-apology apology hurt her. She basically apologized for the behavior of everybody else b/c ultimately it's her name on the show. She said she hadn't realized that THEY were behaving poorly to the crew. When really all the accusations were that she was kinda the monster/diva on the set and it sorta trickled down from there

4761,2020-10-07 17:07:37,j6lvx8,I dont get why treating your employees/co-workers like fellow humans is so hard. How do people get so high on their horse they treat others shittly?

4769,2020-10-07 15:34:34,j6lvx8,I keep wondering about this. There‚Äôs been a continuous media blitz about how bad she is. People who were literally raping people did not get a tenth of the coverage and they never keep a story alive this long. I really think someone is specifically out to get her. I‚Äôm sure a beloved public millionaire is probably a terrible person by now if not originally but Rupert Murdoch bad? Has anyone wrote a ‚Äúwas mean to a waiter ‚Äú story about him in a while? Who is behind this?

4775,2020-10-07 14:29:59,j6lvx8,I'm honestly impressed that viewers are abandoning her over it. Musicians can beat and rape people and it won't make a dent as fans justify why it doesn't matter.
4776,2020-10-07 14:31:39,j6lvx8,I like most was charmed by Ellen. Just reading everything lately it really turns me off. She lost my 10 minutes a year of viewership.

So she wasn't all that funny as a 90's comedian to begin with, and has been basically just riding her ""sHoCkHoRrOr I'm a lesbian"" edge since the 90's when, granted, she was brave for coming out publicly.

She hasn't really displayed any other talents over the years though, and has basically just run the live-action equivalent of a YouTube reactions channel for the last couple decades, calling it a talk show.

She's not even a *one* show pony. And now that her show's done for, I don't think we'll be seeing this pony for much longer :/"

4819,2020-10-07 18:00:57,j6lvx8,I don't care about the why.  But I do enjoy watching a career take some damage.
4820,2020-10-07 18:06:20,j6lvx8,"Many of the other shows according to the article had a drop in ratings too. So where are the people, I mean what are Americans watching nowadays?"
4821,2020-10-07 18:11:51,j6lvx8,Cancel culture finally got one right.
4822,2020-10-07 18:14:01,j6lvx8,You will truly know someone when you turn their wifi off
4823,2020-10-07 18:15:15,j6lvx8,"You would think that someone whose entire career is based upon being likeable would make more of an effort to, you know, actually be likeable."
4824,2020-10-07 18:16:43,j6lvx8,"Good, Ellen is trash. People should watch Conan instead."
4825,2020-10-07 18:17:04,j6lvx8,What's controversial about her being awful to work for?
4826,2020-10-07 18:17:40,j6lvx8,I heard she has REALLY bad breath.
4827,2020-10-07 18:21:35,j6lvx8,"People blame cancel culture.. well guess what? We want real people doing what they love, not shitty people faking who they are. Maybe older generations saw actors as people pretending to be someone else, but that‚Äôs not how millennial and GenZ do. We want actors to be who they are."
4828,2020-10-07 18:25:31,j6lvx8,Surprised she has ratings in the first place. How on earth do people find her show entertaining?
4829,2020-10-07 18:26:37,j6lvx8,"I saw the show yesterday. She knows she‚Äôs been found out, we know what kind of person she really is, and she‚Äôs not even really trying to hide it anymore."
4830,2020-10-07 18:31:23,j6lvx8,"Apparently she‚Äôs now visiting sick kids which her staff during a global pandemic

4831,2020-10-07 18:31:35,j6lvx8,That Epstein island set didn‚Äôt help. Good riddance.
4832,2020-10-07 18:33:38,j6lvx8,The figures in the article of between 790k and 900k viewers for morning talk shows sounds about right for the number of TVs in doctors‚Äô offices and TVs left on for pets or to deter burglars.
4833,2020-10-07 18:34:36,j6lvx8,I want some gossip on james corden. Someone on here said he was a major dick as well
4834,2020-10-07 18:34:44,j6lvx8,She‚Äôll be crying like Lindsey Graham looking for money.
4835,2020-10-07 18:35:39,j6lvx8,I also can‚Äôt believe NBC is running her game show still
4836,2020-10-07 18:44:54,j6lvx8,She is a piece of shit.
4837,2020-10-07 18:49:44,j6lvx8,It‚Äôs poetic how her name ‚ÄúDeGeneres‚Äù can be so easily swapped with ‚ÄúDeGenerate‚Äù
4838,2020-10-07 18:51:15,j6lvx8,"I love Ellen, she‚Äôs the best."
4839,2020-10-07 18:53:40,j6lvx8,I find it hard to find sympathy for rich Hollywood scum like this.
4840,2020-10-07 18:54:45,j6lvx8,I am not upset about this
4841,2020-10-07 18:57:09,j6lvx8,This should be cross posted in r/upliftingnews
4842,2020-10-07 18:57:13,j6lvx8,Good.
4843,2020-10-07 19:00:47,j6lvx8,"Learn how to bow out, set up some side projects or something, no ones gona feel bad."
4844,2020-10-07 19:09:16,j6lvx8,Good
4845,2020-10-07 19:18:45,j6lvx8,"Workplace controversy -> Ratings fall -> Show Cancelled-> No more workplace to have controversy!

If everyone looses then no one wins!"
4846,2020-10-07 19:20:33,j6lvx8,"Show was trash anyway what a sell job , take it off tv already"
4847,2020-10-07 19:23:57,j6lvx8,Just cancel the fucking cunts show already
4848,2020-10-07 19:31:47,j6lvx8,Good. She deserves it. I don‚Äôt by this bullshit about her not knowing.
4849,2020-10-07 19:31:51,j6lvx8,Can‚Äôt say I feel sorry for her...
4850,2020-10-07 19:32:16,j6lvx8,"I'm sure her ""apology"" didn't help"
4851,2020-10-07 19:40:52,j6lvx8,Oh - what's that?

4853,2020-10-07 19:50:05,j6lvx8,I just find her clips not entertaining anymore.
4854,2020-10-07 19:52:00,j6lvx8,So I guess more people get put out of work
4855,2020-10-07 19:52:04,j6lvx8,"Well, she had a long time to straighten it out but like most of her ilk, probably just figured it would continue along and no one would be the wiser. Tough shit Ellen, you have no one to blame but yourself."
4856,2020-10-07 20:00:19,j6lvx8,"hm ... something about ‚Äò taking the gal out of trailer park but can‚Äôt- the trailer part out of the gal ,,, anyway something along those lines"
4857,2020-10-07 20:03:48,j6lvx8,"Makes me think of all the other toxic work places that shit like this still happens at, but they aren‚Äôt tv shows so nothing will change for them."
4858,2020-10-07 20:05:27,j6lvx8,Not so happy dance.
4859,2020-10-07 20:05:36,j6lvx8,"They say when you move to LA you're guaranteed two things:
1. A parking ticket
2. A story about how shitty Ellen Degeneres is."
4860,2020-10-07 20:07:25,j6lvx8,"I‚Äôm surprised it took as long as it did to come out. Remember, people, things aren‚Äôt always as they seem"
4861,2020-10-07 20:11:29,j6lvx8,"Omg, Ellen lost me when she started to dance at the beginning of each of her shows. Which was when the show started. Who has been watching this show? It was so bad."
4862,2020-10-07 20:16:46,j6lvx8,Good
4863,2020-10-07 20:20:09,j6lvx8,Never seen the show
4864,2020-10-07 20:29:47,j6lvx8,Now the employees she was treating like shit might not have jobs soon. It‚Äôs a win-win
4865,2020-10-07 20:33:44,j6lvx8,It‚Äôs amazing how giddy Reddit is over her downfall. People commenting on this that have never seen the show. Wonder why?
4866,2020-10-07 20:42:25,j6lvx8,Always thought something was off about her
4867,2020-10-07 20:43:20,j6lvx8,Never really liked the show
4868,2020-10-07 20:45:28,j6lvx8,"Sorry not sorry, you‚Äôre a fucking moron to watch ANY show relatively similar to hers."
4869,2020-10-07 20:45:45,j6lvx8,Good.
4870,2020-10-07 20:47:21,j6lvx8,truly don‚Äôt have the energy to care about these kinds of things anymore
4871,2020-10-07 20:48:44,j6lvx8,I just like Drew Barrymore better.
4872,2020-10-07 20:48:53,j6lvx8,"If you do watch daytime, Kelly clarkson‚Äôs show is fantastic. She‚Äôs not a comedian, but she‚Äôs funny, engaging, and I hear good things behind the scenes"
4873,2020-10-07 20:53:24,j6lvx8,Is the news really out here trying to cancel a woman of the LGBTQ+ communityüòí
4874,2020-10-07 20:55:27,j6lvx8,"We get this show a couple days delayed here in the U.K. on itv2, and it is honestly one of the worst piece of trash shows on daytime tv, and if you‚Äôve seen daytime tv in the U.K. you‚Äôll know what I mean."
4875,2020-10-07 20:55:31,j6lvx8,Where was cancel culture for this one? Seemed like not long ago any controversy meant cancelation and termination.
4876,2020-10-07 20:56:43,j6lvx8,In other news Kelly Clarkson's doing great and I  love how she can make fun of herself through out her talk show and we all know Texas ain't telling her staff not to eat meat haha there is  always always going to be the next best thing
4877,2020-10-07 21:10:22,j6lvx8,Wait? Again?
4878,2020-10-07 21:24:13,j6lvx8,"Good, it's a terrible show with fake people and fake emotions. I hope it dies off."
4879,2020-10-07 21:27:39,j6lvx8,I feel like a lot of comedy comes from struggle and Ellen haunt struggled at all in well over a decade. Retire her and bring In fresh meat.
4880,2020-10-07 21:30:51,j6lvx8,Let‚Äôs start calling it the Ellen Degenerate Show.
4881,2020-10-07 21:31:41,j6lvx8,Good.  Her official reply reeked of bs.  Real shame but I don't feel she is what she claims to which is fine but don't trade on bs.
4882,2020-10-07 21:32:29,j6lvx8,Time to legalize ranch ;)
4883,2020-10-07 21:34:33,j6lvx8,"So your saying, it‚Äôs hard to believe because she was successful? 

Look at Weinstein then."
4884,2020-10-07 21:35:08,j6lvx8,This is the exact same thing to happen to Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell show! She went from ‚ÄúQueen of Nice‚Äù to queen of bitch!
4885,2020-10-07 21:54:31,j6lvx8,Glad another corporate show about nothing gets canceled.
4886,2020-10-07 22:09:50,j6lvx8,"And that's the way it is, Wednesday Oct. 7th 2020."
4887,2020-10-07 22:19:26,j6lvx8,Reading the news most shows are down. A lot people are cutting cable and moving to streaming.
4888,2020-10-07 23:23:38,j6lvx8,"I don't watch any daytime shows, but if I did, I would watch Drew's.  It makes me sad that it's not doing well."
4889,2020-10-07 23:26:00,j6lvx8,"They spent 6 months blowing it up, so yeah."
4890,2020-10-07 23:37:04,j6lvx8,Good.
4891,2020-10-08 03:56:05,j6lvx8,Is the show still on?  Let‚Äôs go ahead and ignore her. She‚Äôs made enough money already
4892,2020-10-08 05:26:56,j6lvx8,I bet there is one person who doesn‚Äôt care. Make that two because I also don‚Äôt.
4893,2020-10-08 06:08:30,j6lvx8,ellen degenerate
4894,2020-10-08 07:07:28,j6lvx8,Good.
4895,2020-10-08 08:15:29,j6lvx8,THIS IS SO OLD NOW.     MOVE ON!!!
4896,2020-10-08 15:02:33,j6lvx8,Only a true narcissist would keep doing doing shows after this media
4897,2020-10-08 15:31:03,j6lvx8,She‚Äôs a liar and doesn‚Äôt take responsibility
4898,2020-10-08 21:06:47,j6lvx8,"The article says other daytime talk shows are down in ratings as well. I just don't think people are in the mood for vapid shows about celebrity interviews and giveaways. There's no live audiences, either."
4899,2020-10-13 04:58:07,j6lvx8,The way she went off on the translator and the kid was extremely uncomfortable.
4900,2020-12-09 01:10:39,j6lvx8,"She never has apologized for her bad behavior, never apologized for her attitude. She shifts blame. A horrible person does not know they are horrible. She has not changed and will not change. A narcissist is truly toxic to be around."
4901,2020-10-07 07:35:24,j6lvx8,Ellen who? /s
4902,2020-10-07 13:24:54,j6lvx8,"She's been on tv too long as it is, she should've ended it when she was doing really well. Now disgraced. I do not feel bad for her, I feel for the employees she harassed."
4903,2020-10-07 13:36:35,j6lvx8,It's almost like they knows she's bullshit!
4904,2020-10-07 13:50:35,j6lvx8,She‚Äôs the worst
4905,2020-10-07 13:56:13,j6lvx8,this pleases me
4906,2020-10-07 14:01:11,j6lvx8,Bout time
4907,2020-10-07 14:08:35,j6lvx8,"good, she's a cunt"
4908,2020-10-07 14:10:08,j6lvx8,"If you‚Äôve ever worked with or had to deal with a toxic asshole regularly, ditching Ellen is like a small victory."
4909,2020-10-07 14:11:04,j6lvx8,Couldn't have happened to a nicer person.
4910,2020-10-07 14:14:35,j6lvx8,Couldn‚Äôt happen to a more deserving person based on current news.
4911,2020-10-07 14:16:23,j6lvx8,Fuck Ellen.
4912,2020-10-07 14:20:45,j6lvx8,"Good. 

Let her show die."
4913,2020-10-07 14:23:19,j6lvx8,All you gotta do is look at her stupid game show to realize what a sadist she is. Who gets off on humiliating people ‚Äúfor fun‚Äù unless you basically hate people?
4914,2020-10-07 14:29:28,j6lvx8,Duh
4915,2020-10-07 14:30:06,j6lvx8,The key to success is to remain humble. I guess E‚Äôlan didn‚Äôt know that.
4916,2020-10-07 14:34:49,j6lvx8,"People are just realising this about her?

I've known about this for at least 5 years and I don't even watch her"
4917,2020-10-07 14:41:00,j6lvx8,Time to replace Ellen with Eric Andre!
4918,2020-10-07 14:43:39,j6lvx8,She always seemed a bit fake anyways. I remember she asked Leighton Meester about being born in a prison. Like ok rude
4919,2020-10-07 14:43:48,j6lvx8,Let it burn
4920,2020-10-07 14:46:16,j6lvx8,"Sadly the toxic workplace reveal won't hurt Ellen as much as the staff... Who,well, reported it."
4921,2020-10-07 14:49:23,j6lvx8,How is it still on the air during all this
4922,2020-10-07 14:49:44,j6lvx8,"Her show sucked long befor all this happened.
Put down the vino and pills stay at home moms and go out side."
4923,2020-10-07 14:51:16,j6lvx8,It mentions live with Kelly & Ryan in the article. I assume Kelly & Ryan from the Office? Is is just Kelly complaining to guests about Ryan? Is he always saying he's actually single to the cute female guests? Personally I would prefer live with Jimmy & Dwight.
4924,2020-10-07 14:52:06,j6lvx8,Good
4925,2020-10-07 14:52:37,j6lvx8,"Out of touch rich folks, nothing surprising here. Once you lose that connection with the audience you are toast. Good night Ellen , enjoy your retirement."
4926,2020-10-07 14:56:37,j6lvx8,Who still watches this?
4927,2020-10-07 14:56:47,j6lvx8,"Just retire and go live with your 100s of millions of dollars somewhere people don't know you. Jeez why the hell is she even still working, especially after everything happening to her now."
4928,2020-10-07 14:58:15,j6lvx8,It's just not as good now that she's not abusing staff...
4929,2020-10-07 14:59:15,j6lvx8,She's not even funny to anyone under 35 I feel
4930,2020-10-07 16:14:35,j6lvx8,"I would guess that at least 50% of the entertainment industry has problems with toxic workplaces. The movie ""Swimming with Sharks"" was based on some fact. It doesn't seem right that Ellen should be punished for this while others are not."
4931,2020-10-07 13:55:19,j6lvx8,I would never watch someone mean on TV..
4932,2020-10-07 14:08:30,j6lvx8,Won‚Äôt have a shitty workplace if you don‚Äôt have a workplace!
4933,2020-10-07 14:35:09,j6lvx8,"Ellen is a manure eating monster, everybody knows that."
4934,2020-10-07 14:46:45,j6lvx8, I‚Äôm surprised it took this long. They‚Äôve been talking about how different the ‚Äúreal‚Äù Ellen is for YEARS. I remember reading about some of her attitude and some things she did to people several years ago and I‚Äôve ignored everything Ellen ever since.
4935,2020-10-07 14:47:52,j6lvx8,Good. I feel sorry for the people that work there.
4936,2020-10-07 15:03:12,j6lvx8,It must be hard for viewers to watch the show knowing that Ellen can‚Äôt stand them.
4937,2020-10-07 15:26:11,j6lvx8,I feel bad she drug Twitch into this mess
4938,2020-10-07 15:29:13,j6lvx8,All my homies hate the ‚ÄòEllen DeGeneres Show‚Äô
4939,2020-10-07 15:29:14,j6lvx8,Ellen is a puke
4940,2020-10-07 15:46:31,j6lvx8,did you guya know she is a pedo?
4941,2020-10-07 15:53:03,j6lvx8,"I‚Äôve been watching Ellen for years and I‚Äôve definitely noticed her becoming more bitter as she gets older. You could tell shes a jerk but that‚Äôs OK, she‚Äôs just like any one of us. Her rambling monologues, sarcastic humour, and impatience with guests who aren‚Äôt A lists. It‚Äôs not easy to keep up that public perception. But that shouldn‚Äôt take away from the many good things she does."
4942,2020-10-07 15:53:38,j6lvx8,I really turned on Ellen when she defended Kevin Hart...really goes to show she wasn't interested in standing up for the little people when it was her rich friend in the line of fire...
4943,2020-10-07 15:56:29,j6lvx8,#Brickfrog should be her next guest
4944,2020-10-07 16:04:23,j6lvx8,Not because of her link to Epstein? Hmm
4945,2020-10-07 16:07:39,j6lvx8,EG is sooo far up her own backside to care about and recognize others
4946,2020-10-07 16:18:30,j6lvx8,How is her show still on?
4947,2020-10-07 16:27:10,j6lvx8,Goes to show that you can‚Äôt be untalented AND an asshole. You have to pick one
4948,2020-10-07 16:45:47,j6lvx8,She was really good as dory
4949,2020-10-07 16:47:28,j6lvx8,It‚Äôs situations like this that make me never believe any celebrity about anything. I can only trust people I know. Even then they let you down D:
4950,2020-10-07 16:54:13,j6lvx8,"According to this article, bunch of other shows had big drop in ratings as well, so what was their problem? Also Ellen's mismanagement? Or maybe they all dropped ratings because of same reason."
4951,2020-10-07 17:04:07,j6lvx8,Just retire already for god sake....
4952,2020-10-07 17:05:56,j6lvx8,Thoughts and prayers
4953,2020-10-07 17:11:14,j6lvx8,r/UpliftingNews
4954,2020-10-07 17:40:44,j6lvx8,Hopefully this signals an end to celebrity worship. I think most people have seen the consequences it can have (Trump) and that these people can be entertainment and nothing more.
4955,2020-10-07 18:04:08,j6lvx8,Good - people should idolise someone who clearly has no real heart for what they do and it ruins all their past works by shifting perspective towards doing it for ratings rather than being genuine.
4956,2020-10-07 18:14:30,j6lvx8,The Ellen Degenerate show!
4957,2020-10-07 18:23:39,j6lvx8,I‚Äôm pretty sure all those conspiracies about her being a pedophile didn‚Äôt help either
4958,2020-10-07 18:43:59,j6lvx8,She built her whole show and reputation around being Ms. Fun and Happy. Of course she's gonna tank when it turns out she's an omega class bitch.
4959,2020-10-07 19:08:22,j6lvx8,If you can count Steve Jobs as someone you can just call on the phone and ask for a favor... You're likely a shitty person.
4960,2020-10-07 19:10:03,j6lvx8,It‚Äôs so irritating this is blamed as the undoing of this show instead of the fact that it is horrendously shitty.
4961,2020-10-07 19:11:53,j6lvx8,"Ellen has sucked for a long time, people in the entertainment industry shared stories about what a monster she is for years, this only happened AFTER she appeared at the super bowl with Bush, people had enough and the general public was ready to be done with her"
4962,2020-10-07 19:24:45,j6lvx8,How is that asshole even still on the air?
4963,2020-10-07 19:41:18,j6lvx8,Yeah she has her millions. She only thing that impacts her is the doesn't get her show. Queue 3 years when everyone has forgotten and she does an a apology.
4964,2020-10-07 19:43:03,j6lvx8,Whos even watching this show still?
4965,2020-10-07 20:41:43,j6lvx8,Couldn't happen to a nicer...
4966,2020-10-07 21:04:14,j6lvx8,But she said she was sorry.
4967,2020-10-07 15:07:34,j6lvx8,"Damn. People are such pussies now days. Micro aggressions? 

Fuck man, I had wrenches and raw billet thrown my way for fucking up. Been called a retard, stupid, whatever by my boss. 

And this is only 10 years ago. Fucking pussies."
4968,2020-10-07 14:26:45,j6lvx8,"I watched a clip where they had this college student talking about how her laptop was stolen, and she had to work OT for weeks to save enough money to get another one because she is getting buried by tuition and expenses.

Ellen starts to say ""well, we've teamed up with this company and we're going to..."", her assistant comes out and starts whispering in her ear.  Back and forth a couple of times.

Then she says ""We're going to buy you a new laptop.""

Student:  ""Well, I already have one, but... thank you""

&#x200B;

There was a major miscommunication and it looked like Ellen was going to say that they were going to pay for her tuition.

Had she said ""Well, they say we're buying you a new laptop but I've just decided that I am going to pay for you tuition!!!""... at least she could have something to show people.  

Instead, she Michael Scotted them!"
4969,2020-10-07 14:49:49,j6lvx8,"she set herself up for failure with her ""be kind to others"" persona, something she eludes to in her Netflix comedy special. People hold her to standards even she cant meet.

That being said, there are far worse people (men) in the entertainment industry that have gone and done monstrous things to others and their careers remain relatively unscathed.

Its no coincidence, with the current ""Woke"" backlash going on today, that a celebrity lesbian of privilege, is subjected to the pitchfork and bonfire treatment she's getting."
4970,2020-10-07 15:28:07,j6lvx8,"It's weird how the people most obsessed with Ellen are male redditors.

If it weren't for the daily posts about her here, I would never hear about her."
4971,2020-10-07 15:56:28,j6lvx8,"Every single complaint translated to ‚ÄúI thought I was special and going to hang with Ellen all day but it turned out to just be a shitty entry level job‚Äù

Oh except the highly unbelievable racist comment about not knowing POC names which unsurprisingly wasn‚Äôt reported and only shared years later after the person got fired. Yup sure."
4972,2020-10-07 17:29:59,j6lvx8,"Sure she paved the way for open LGBT characters in TV sitcoms. 

  
But she is mean so let's cancel her. Y'all be ruthless."
4973,2020-10-07 19:31:45,j6lvx8,"Gotta love watching the left eat its own!

Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!1!!!"
4974,2020-10-07 22:57:25,j6lvx8,Just look at her eyes. She's evil.
4975,2020-10-08 00:34:36,j6lvx8,Next is James Cordon
4976,2020-10-07 12:44:20,j6lvx8,"If the show gets pulled, maybe she can start doing light entertainment on downmarket cruise ships telling dad jokes.....um, wait a minute..."
4977,2020-10-07 14:57:08,j6lvx8,Good fuck that bitch
4978,2020-10-07 14:28:54,j6lvx8,Ellen was a good comedian. She should have stuck to that.
4979,2020-10-07 14:13:01,j6lvx8,I mean fuck Ellen and all but isn't almost everything on tv having a ratings freefall?
4980,2020-10-07 14:28:12,j6lvx8,"Everything on cable TV is down 30-60% in viewership, including sports."
4981,2020-10-07 15:23:19,j6lvx8,"Because we are sick of ""celebrities"" and their shit. They will be second against the walls after the politicians.

I mean did ANYONE believe her..and I use this term loosely ""apology""."
4982,2020-10-07 15:40:19,j6lvx8,"So, since she's a horrible boss, why didn't people just quit? Now they are going to lose their job anyways."
4983,2020-10-07 15:56:03,j6lvx8,"Yeah, who gives a shit?"
4984,2020-10-07 16:36:42,j6lvx8,"Everyone thinks all the shit she gives away is from hers. Hell no, shit she let her staff die on the vine when COVID19 HIT. She socks anything i see with her face makes me change the channel. Boo Hiss.."
4985,2020-10-07 17:01:58,j6lvx8,"This very article shows All these talk shows are down. Just more gossipy ""create-a-story"" bs"
4986,2020-10-07 18:38:06,j6lvx8,She honestly has not seemed nearly as joyful the last few years. Her love affair with day time TV just lost it's fire and change is hard. If you need a new outlet for that passion we could use you in the streets Ellen.
4987,2020-10-07 19:00:11,j6lvx8,I love how there is suddenly thousands upon thousands of redditors who knew all this the whole time.
4988,2020-10-07 19:55:08,j6lvx8,"Ellen is trash.  She once said something regarding making the Mario brothers gay for each other. Absolutely sick, SICK person."
4989,2020-10-08 02:26:11,j6lvx8,"She‚Äôs mates with Bush, she‚Äôs a wasteman and this is deserved"
4990,2020-10-08 03:44:35,j6lvx8,"All the daytime shows are down in ratings because they are boring without audiences. None of them interact with their audience more than Ellen, and a big part of her appeal is all the stuff she gives away. She can't do at all anymore, so it makes sense that hers would be down more. 

I doubt the scandal hurt her much. Her fans love her no matter what. Most of the snark is coming from those who don't care for her anyway. Her fans know she's crazy wealthy, she doesn't hide it, she makes it major part if her schtick. The worst scandals had to do with the management at the show, and not her personally. As for her behavior towards others, we all know that's probably exaggerated to at least some degree. 

So it's all Ellen-bashing, and I doubt she cares that much. Her show is still doing fine, and her game show it doing very well. Her friends still love her, and she knows most of her fans are still with her."
4991,2020-10-08 05:41:35,j6lvx8,Why is she still on the show?
4992,2020-10-07 14:26:35,j6lvx8,"I have always found her personality irritating and have always referred to her as Ellen Degenerate.  I never understood why she appealed to anyone.  I honestly was hoping Arsenio Hall would come back, kick her ass of the stage and take over."
4993,2020-10-07 13:54:06,j6lvx8,Recipient of the freedom award everyone
4994,2020-10-07 14:50:45,j6lvx8,Ellen Degenerated.
4995,2020-10-07 16:16:00,j6lvx8,"What exactly did Ellen do wrong? I read that she‚Äôs a ‚Äú bully‚Äù. What does that mean?

David Letterman sexually harassed lots of employees and now he‚Äôs a beloved celebrity with a Netflix show. 

What did Ellen do that is so bad? Because I don‚Äôt consider ‚Äúbeing a shitty boss‚Äù to be a crime."

4997,2020-10-07 15:18:46,j6lvx8,I love all the hypocritical liberals  wanting to get a women fired for not acting like a stereotypical polite lady.

5000,2020-10-07 14:01:14,j6lvx8,Her show is also not even remotely funny when she‚Äôs just sitting behind a camera at home.
5001,2020-10-07 14:04:10,j6lvx8,Does anyone else get bothered by the weird movie dream sequence style filter they seem to use??? Weird AF
5002,2020-10-07 14:06:37,j6lvx8,"Good. Ellen is a c u next Tuesday, and treats people like garbage"
5003,2020-10-07 14:09:14,j6lvx8,I seriously don't know how to react to this. I mean what was in the show worth watching that it didn't get low ratings before toxic workplace controversy.
5004,2020-10-07 14:17:00,j6lvx8,TIL the show hasn't been cancelled yet.
5005,2020-10-07 14:21:42,j6lvx8,Good?
5006,2020-10-07 14:22:25,j6lvx8,The biggest problem is Ellen. She wanted the atmosphere she got and she supported it through her actions.
5007,2020-10-07 14:25:54,j6lvx8,"I don‚Äôt know what it is about Ellen, but I never liked her. Just thought she was annoying and really corny. She just has a hateable face"
5008,2020-10-07 23:48:53,j6lvx8,"Can't we just cancel Wendy Williams instead she deserves it way more and dosn't do shit 4 charity compared to Ellen, Ellen is definitely wrong but I'd bet so many celebrities doing what she did just without the millions she provides to people below the poverty line"
5009,2020-10-08 02:38:27,j6lvx8,I think she is funny. I am not making excuses but she is under a tremendous amount of pressure to put on a great show.
5010,2020-10-07 12:27:00,j6lvx8,"Wow, sit next to one former president and watch the feeding frenzy."
5011,2020-10-07 23:33:43,j6lvx8,"Amazing how many people are comfortable calling a woman a ""bitch"".  Amazing."
5012,2020-10-08 04:34:49,j6lvx8,"She pals around with George Fucking Bush, why is anyone still watching?"
5013,2020-10-07 11:50:57,j6lvx8,"I hated working for Ellen she was such a bitch. Oh and then a few days into my job I found out I was getting paid in ""exposure"". You start out as volunteer work and have to work your up to get a real job and get paid in real money.

I walked out."

5016,2020-10-08 00:00:52,j6lvx8,Can we just cancel everybody and everything except Keanu Reeves and Marvel movies
5017,2020-10-07 13:08:17,j6lvx8,"Truly the Steve Jobs of the entertainment industry

Beloved, only to later find out she‚Äôs an asshole"
5018,2020-10-07 12:41:33,j6lvx8,"I'm more surprised she had the balls to try continue the show. Any self-respecting multi-millionaire host would just step down and retire quietly away from the spotlight. She already has so much money she could have retired 10 years ago, and clearly the show and her reputation are tainted, so why does she want to continue so badly? Contractual obligations perhaps?"
5019,2020-10-07 13:32:28,j6lvx8,"Watch her game show, it tells you all you need to know about her, and what she finds amusing."
5020,2020-10-07 13:46:22,j6lvx8,"as is often the case, comedians had been telling people about Ellen forever, but as usual people just thought it was comedians being mean. Norm Macdonald had been saying she was a shitty person since his SNL days like 25 years ago"
5021,2020-10-07 14:11:33,j6lvx8,"I‚Äôve been hearing and seeing Ellen stories for years now, but it only seemed to really pick up momentum this summer. I‚Äôm also surprised it took so long."
5022,2020-10-07 13:51:18,j6lvx8,"> I HIGHLY doubt she just turned into a shitty person recently.

People's notions of shittiness have shifted in that time, no one is scrutinizing any other daily daytime talk shows, and expectations regarding Ellen's behavior are being benchmarked against a perceived self-labeling as exceptionally nice and giving rise to separate accusations of hypocrisy."
5023,2020-10-07 12:30:01,j6lvx8,The way she treated her staff during quarantine was appalling.
5024,2020-10-07 13:41:20,j6lvx8,"If she has forced her guest to declare her pregnancy secret on camera, you bet she is a major asshole off-camera"
5025,2020-10-07 13:52:55,j6lvx8,She's definitely not the only shitty person with a hit TV show though.  I'm surprised her viewers give a shit.
5026,2020-10-07 14:22:16,j6lvx8,"well, when you hide things from the general public, they don't come out right away. Recent examples: Wienstein, Cosby, Epstein."
5027,2020-10-07 10:21:31,j6lvx8,Adam Carolla said that he knew she was a phony because they were at a wedding together and she didn't dance once in over 4 hours.
5028,2020-10-07 14:17:04,j6lvx8,"Nah dude, this been going on since her days on her old TV show."
5029,2020-10-07 13:49:11,j6lvx8,"I had heard about her being a shitbag years and years ago but kind of dismissed it. One because I really don‚Äôt care and two because it‚Äôs hard to believe everything you hear, so this definitely isn‚Äôt some brand new thing."
5030,2020-10-07 15:18:04,j6lvx8,"People truly have been afraid to speak the truth against power. Especially post 9/11

But these days people, especially the younger generation, don‚Äôt take shit amd will call you out. 

I mean even look at Fox News and all the me too that came out of there. Not very long ago, no one would‚Äôve stood up and spoke out. Glad people started now."
5031,2020-10-07 13:31:44,j6lvx8,Agree!! I hated that shitty were sorry and I have learned from this experience. It took her 62 years of here life to finally learn not to treat people like shit?
5032,2020-10-07 14:25:09,j6lvx8,"Powerful people are really good at insulating and protecting themselves. It's the same thing (obviously to a much less extreme) that happened with Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby. It was almost an open secret that both of them were serial rapists but no one ever did anything about it because they didn't want their careers ruined. It's kinda the same thing with Ellen. Celebrities needed her to promote their shows, the people working for her needed her for their jobs, and no one ever thought to do anything about it until our saviour Dakota Johnson finally did last year."
5033,2020-10-07 15:46:43,j6lvx8,"would ending the show really help all of the people working there tho? I would rather stay employed, and have the issues be addressed personally."
5034,2020-10-07 15:48:38,j6lvx8,"What I don't understand is that I, an unconnected person not in ""the biz,"" have heard these rumors FOR YEARS.  Yet, I'm hearing all kinds of show-biz people come forward and say they never knew. I'm baffled. How did I know that she was a behind the scenes diva before them? I knew her happy-go-lucky persona was all a front for her audience."
5035,2020-10-07 15:55:15,j6lvx8,"I mean Epstein‚Äôs abuse also lasted pretty long. Not saying Ellen is as shitty as him, but a guy worse than Ellen can hide shit worse than hers, then Ellen can do the same on actions lighter than Epstein‚Äôs"
5036,2020-10-07 17:23:13,j6lvx8,"At the same time, how did little to nothing come out about it for 18 years? NDA‚Äôs?"
5037,2020-10-07 19:47:56,j6lvx8,"My wife used to watch Ellen all the time. One day she showed me the episode where Ellen visited the Porsche Experience Center, and my wife was laughing but I kept thinking, ""It's not funny.""

I recently watched it again and it's even worse than I remembered.

At one point Ellen is sitting in various cars honking the horns (because she needs to 'speak with the cars') and Andy (her E.P.) is outside, and either Andy forgot he was mic'd up or maybe it was a cry for help, but you hear Andy say to the two Porsche reps something like: ""This is what my day is like. Every day. Twenty-four, seven.""

Or maybe I'm just reading to much into what may have been a casual, flippant statement made by someone that Ellen appeared to constantly torment and harass."
5038,2020-10-08 00:47:25,j6lvx8,"She‚Äôs a literal trash. She was my passenger in first class fews years back. She treated the staff like shit, complaining about everything, not accepting to follow onboard rules, talked in a rude way to the crew. Not surprised to read that news."
5039,2020-10-07 13:29:14,j6lvx8,She‚Äôs an influencer. Not hard to imagine the toxic environment was there from day 1.
5040,2020-10-07 14:14:57,j6lvx8,"It wasn't about her being shitty. Most complaints about her personally, sounded entitled and petty to me.  Like she was expected to be happy and smiles to everybody 24/7.   The controversy was in regards to how others were treating others.   And Ellen was not in the know.   They feel she should be personally responsible for the hundreds of employees, and not an HR leader or something."
5041,2020-10-07 13:40:46,j6lvx8,Yeah I feel like this is more about the covid/remote situation. Her show's highlights are usually her interaction with her guests and audience. She doesn't have that now.
5042,2020-10-07 13:51:56,j6lvx8,"Agreed, I always heard how shitty she was without ever actually looking into it"
5043,2020-10-07 14:05:24,j6lvx8,A lot of people are out of jobs right now and feel they can speak freely for once in their lives. I'm not saying that's what happened here but it's been a general theme this year
5044,2020-10-07 14:18:11,j6lvx8,"I do not understand how people can see her brand of awkwardness and mean jokes as an act. She gave many clues over the years about her shitty character

It feels funny initially cause she‚Äôs a lesbian so she‚Äôs cut some slack. But later she got so big that her guests just smile it away. Ellen is NOT wholesome"
5045,2020-10-07 14:29:40,j6lvx8,Did you hear about the adoption controversy from a few years ago?  She kept going to an animal shelter and getting a new puppy or cat until they stopped being cute.  Then she'd throw the animal away and get another one. Shes a fucking psychopath.
5046,2020-10-07 14:38:04,j6lvx8,"She can just retire, when any potential contract issues are gone, and then start a podcast.  Less restrictions and still free money"
5047,2020-10-07 14:40:19,j6lvx8,I heard that she was a shitty person from a person that interned with her and this was 11 years ago. Very similar allegations to what we see now. Zero surprise for me.
5048,2020-10-07 14:58:38,j6lvx8,You should watch her standup on Netflix.  Just the intro.  It's cringeworthy and mirrors what I think has been said about her in her own words. She's rich and pissses in gold toilets and didn't care about you or I Haha.
5049,2020-10-07 15:00:08,j6lvx8,I feel like the public only recently started holding famous people accountable to their private actions instead of deferring to their public facing persona. I think Bill Cosby finally brings convicted had a lot to do with it. There‚Äôs cognitive dissonance after watching someone‚Äôs fake persona for decades. We feel like we know them.
5050,2020-10-07 15:05:00,j6lvx8,18 years??? Am I that old... Jesus
5051,2020-10-07 15:14:58,j6lvx8,I find her funny but you can tell she's being just plain condescending to plenty of her guests. I'm not surprised at all. What does surprise me is how long it took for people to realize she's just unpleasant to people.
5052,2020-10-07 15:31:38,j6lvx8,Amazing what will come out when suddenly everyone who works for you isn‚Äôt getting paid anymore.
5053,2020-10-07 15:44:25,j6lvx8,"> Kinda surprised this didn't happen sooner.

tell that to people about harvey weinstein in 2008"
5054,2020-10-07 15:55:26,j6lvx8,Right & also good. I'm glad.
5055,2020-10-07 15:57:01,j6lvx8,Hollywood is toxic. Look at how long Harvey Weinstein went unchecked until they made him a scapegoat to distract from the rest.
5056,2020-10-07 15:57:27,j6lvx8,I thought she was shitty a couple years ago when I saw she sexualized her male workers on the show. She made them go shirtless around the set. I don‚Äôt know I thought it was strict double standards of how we will call out incidents of girls having to wear revealing shirts or be sexual but we won‚Äôt for guys.
5057,2020-10-07 15:59:27,j6lvx8,"Just looked Weinstein, internet lets you know that you're not alone, and empowers you to come out."
5058,2020-10-07 16:00:13,j6lvx8,It DID happen sooner. But then she came out and everyone kinda forgot about it.
5059,2020-10-07 16:01:33,j6lvx8,Look up what she did for the MGM hotels in Vegas after the shooting that left 58 dead and over 500 injured.. She had some security guard and hotel staffer on her show that worked at the hotel and they made up an elaborate story to kind of get MGM off the hook even though there is CC video evidence the police and security could have stopped the shooter before killing half of the people that died that day. Ellen did all of this for the MGM because she had a deal to get Ellen slot machines installed into their casinos.
5060,2020-10-07 16:06:29,j6lvx8,"I know people who have worked with her several times, can confirm she has always been this way."
5061,2020-10-07 16:13:29,j6lvx8,I‚Äôve been hearing shit about Ellen for at least ten years.
5062,2020-10-07 16:29:34,j6lvx8,"She hadn't. It's been an open ""secret"". Brought it up every single year we went to Epcot and did the Universe of Energy ride. Earliest I remember, was like 10 years ago when I was 13."
5063,2020-10-07 16:37:50,j6lvx8,"These rumors were always out there, I‚Äôm surprised it took this long for it to actually catch on"
5064,2020-10-07 16:40:40,j6lvx8,"Yeah, but this whole holding powerful celebrities accountable for how they treat people away from the cameras thing is a fairly new phenomenon."
5065,2020-10-07 16:45:31,j6lvx8,In all her interviews there was alaways a passive aggressive vibe to all her guests.
5066,2020-10-07 16:52:29,j6lvx8,Well look at how long weinstein lasted
5067,2020-10-07 17:05:54,j6lvx8,Well she did try to sign a baby's face with a Sharpie a few years ago but Michelle Obama stopped her from doing it. She is a fucking terrible and out of touch asshole.
5068,2020-10-07 17:44:16,j6lvx8,I feel like the fact of her being good friends with George W. Bush should have changed public perception of her a lot sooner than all of this.
5069,2020-10-07 17:51:28,j6lvx8,"I think celebrity culture is changing which is good, we need to stop idolizing these people. If they fuck up and abuse there position, we shouldn't support them."
5070,2020-10-07 17:53:43,j6lvx8,Once a shithole always a shithole. Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever seen anything I didn‚Äôt expect to come out of my shithole
5071,2020-10-07 18:21:44,j6lvx8,She's had at least 3 shows named after herself - one of which was a 'sitcom'.  She's always been a shitty person.
5072,2020-10-07 18:22:12,j6lvx8,And somehow Wendy Williams still has a show.
5073,2020-10-07 18:25:20,j6lvx8,"I'm in my mid 30s and the as far back as my memories of Ellen go, I can remember hearing what a piece of shit she was.

Literally hasn't been a single moment in time where I knew who she was and didn't know about the negative stories.

I'm not as surprised that it took so long as I am surprised that it's actually starting to bite her in the ass at all. I honestly just assumed it was common knowledge and she was in too good of a position to be hurt by it."

It's just you can only grease the palms for so long + the junior subordinates in a lot of industry have felt empowered by the recent political climate to hold their abusive superiors accountable. 'That's the way the industry is' or 'that's the way the boss is' is no longer the acceptable answer it was 10 years ago. There was a lot of money riding on keeping that show on the road, but eventually it comes out. I also would say being as wealthy and powerful as Ellen has been in showbiz for as long as she's been in the business changes you, so it's not necessarily that she's always been like this."
5075,2020-10-07 18:38:32,j6lvx8,This shit has been going around for years. I remember some of it running the gambit on a few forums I frequented all through the 2000‚Äôs.

5081,2020-10-07 19:32:24,j6lvx8,"I‚Äôve heard it talked about for years from people who‚Äôve worked on the show. Just like the rampant rape and pedophilia that has plagued Hollywood for decades, this was an open secret. It just took somebody to finally scream hard enough to blow the door off."
5082,2020-10-07 19:41:46,j6lvx8,"You mean that the internet decided to hate somebody simply because of accusations and hear say? Rather than concrete evidence of any wrong doing. Yeah, you're right, it's shocking it took so long."
5083,2020-10-07 19:46:14,j6lvx8,Maybe she‚Äôs always been Shitty. It just didn‚Äôt come out until now.

Ellen chastised and embarrassed her like a little kid on live TV like such a bully. She's a mean, bitter, little chipper lesbian bitch and she's getting exposed now as she rightfully should have for all these years. Fuck her and her show, let her wither."
5107,2020-10-07 14:07:26,j6lvx8,Right. I'm skeptical if it's really because she's a terrible person or just the state of tv shows in general right now with all going on.
5108,2020-10-07 16:58:02,j6lvx8,"> Early-evening infotainment magazine shows also saw ratings cool, led by ""Access Hollywood"" (down 34%), and ""Extra"" (off 26%);

34% & 26% = ""ratings cool"", 38% = ""ratings freefall"" lol

I mean, I get why it's written the way it is. It's just interesting that most people will interpret this as an article about Ellen, when it's really an article about ratings."
5109,2020-10-07 20:40:43,j6lvx8,Great point. I downvoted the thread because of this.
5110,2020-10-07 19:22:30,j6lvx8,Graham Norton putting them to shame
5111,2020-10-07 18:57:24,j6lvx8,I think there's been a turning away from celebrity culture this year.  Fawning talk shows were bound to be a casualty.
5112,2020-10-07 17:21:57,j6lvx8,"Did you read the numbers? Her ratings fell *twice* as much as anyone else, and she's a *much bigger* star than any of those others. The only show that even came close to losing her numbers isn't even in the same category, and it's genuinely a useless show too. Also numbers went *up* in two places (though likely just took viewers from someone else, still).

The headline stands."
5113,2020-10-07 07:07:19,j6lvx8,"probably a lot of factors, i bet the people who used to watch but now think she is a bitch so they are turning it off is pretty low.  like the article says, everyone is suffering. there is a lot going on right now and i wouldn't be surprised to hear more people are turning on the news channels instead.

i'm surprised to see that they would put drew barrymore up against kelly ripa in major cities.  drew certainly has her work cut out for her."
5114,2020-10-07 15:16:35,j6lvx8,Yep especially because 50% of the show is Ellen waiting for the audience to stop screaming.
5115,2020-10-07 14:20:16,j6lvx8,Ya or that she‚Äôs a cunt
5116,2020-10-07 16:14:01,j6lvx8,"I think it's a lot of things with her. A good chunk to do with her controversy and the outting of her personality issues and behaviour. But that being said yeah the pandemic and lack of audience doesn't help. 

Hell look at many other talk show hosts from the late night or day shows it's a struggle for a lot of them right now. A few have really worked it and made the situation funny and worked around it like Conan whose carried it off pretty well but some hosts clearly are struggling to bring the charisma and charm when there is no audience to play off for laughs or interactions. It's a shitty situation for all of them. Very few can pull it off without some level of awkwardness. I know a few have so far of the late night hosts but some of the late night hosts...oof it's bad. Like you can see it in their face that it's not the same when they trying to play up their opening monologues and jokes."
5117,2020-10-07 16:47:28,j6lvx8,"If anyone bothered to read the article past the click-bait headline, they'd see it reports that ***basically every major daytime talkshow*** had at least a 17% drop in viewers.  

Ellen's show just dropped by the most."
5118,2020-10-07 17:20:37,j6lvx8,"Imagine Ellen coming up into the audience and ""asking"" you to dance, especially at this stage when she'd probably be desperate. fuckin awkward"

5125,2020-10-07 14:14:10,j6lvx8,Because of the pandemic shows with host like Seth Meyers and the Stephen Colbert show are proving to be less entertaining than existing YouTube commentary channels. They are arguably worse then them when it comes to the quality.

I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the kind of talk show your talking about though."
5131,2020-10-07 14:59:02,j6lvx8,Except the Graham Norton show that is tv gold
5132,2020-10-07 15:04:42,j6lvx8,"You‚Äôre totally right. I can easily find myself clicking on one of those Wired Autocomplete interviews or an episode of Hot Ones (which people usually appear on when they‚Äôre promoting a movie) when I‚Äôm on YouTube. People seem to be more themselves and less rehearsed on things like that. Podcasts can be good too.

Talks shows just seem pretty outdated. I‚Äôll only really watch them if I know who‚Äôs going to be on and I like them. Most of the time, they‚Äôll post highlights on their YouTube channel anyway, like The Graham Norton Show, Team Coco and Jimmy Kimmel Live. Those are probably the few I‚Äôd watch (maybe Jimmy Fallon too depending on the video), but all the other ones are pretty dreadful: James Corden is horrible and everyone else is way too political for my liking.

The daytime ones are a bit tame for me, but I suppose they need something to fill those slots."
5133,2020-10-07 14:52:22,j6lvx8,Oh no just like online content
5134,2020-10-07 14:58:06,j6lvx8,"If you want to do a good talk show that people will tune into, stop scripting the interviews and make it about genuine interactions between the quest and the host, people go out of their way to search for things that humanize celebrities."

I thought she was a progressive person who knew sexual objectification in the media (I knew she was a lesbian herself), yet she did  it so blatantly on live television, the irony was so obvious I felt like a real iron hit me in the face."

5168,2020-10-07 13:37:09,j6lvx8,"Being a toxic bitch is not okay and I've never been a fan of hers. 

But, to be fair, she is pretty universally rated as an excellent stand up comedian. Most of her peers consider her to be one of the best. 

I think a long time ago she completely lost touch with reality and thats a fatal position for a comedian. She hasn't been as funny as she once was for a long time. That doesn't mean she was never funny, though."

If she just quit, thats a ton of people out of jobs. The network probably has a contract that she somehow didn't violate as well.

My guess is that with the low ratings they'll make a new show to replace her. But I'm sure they'll just hire new people and pay them less because they can. Ellen is getting heat, so no one will pay attention or think about the production teams and them not having jobs.

Unless the network is just willing to retain those people and keep paying them what they're getting paid now for some kind of PR. But I would think they'd rather get new people and just pay less.

There's a manager, an agent, secretaries and other staff, a publicist, and we're just getting started. You need to keep all these people fed. You can't just cut them loose, because then they won't be around when you need them. And you need them because they are some of the few people you trust to get it right.

So you take on some easy work, so the money keeps rolling in and you can keep feeding your machine. Also that way you stay current and people remember your name..

Even her game shows on her talk show are usually about making the audience members look dumb or pulling pranks on people. But again never pranks on Ellen though because you can tell she hates when someone gets her. Her eyes give it away she looks secretly pissed but she's like ahaha you got me.....I'll get you back later for making me look silly on camera.  


Also I can never get over how she treated that poor translator when she had a young asian music prodigy on her show one time. Jesus she was so mean and condescending to that poor woman the entire time she was trying to interpret what the boy was saying. Just let the woman do her job Ellen so she can speak for the kid who doesn't speak english. Ellen was an awful, awkward bitch to that woman and even the audience was feeling the awkwardness."

Also she pulled classic Youtuber apology mode.

At that time she‚Äôd receive death threats on the daily, and they even had to deal with a bomb scare during filming. Her coming out killed her career for almost a decade until she finally landed her talk show deal.

Those companies didn't give a crap about helping anyone out outside her show since they are not getting good publicity."
5380,2020-10-07 14:05:05,j6lvx8,"""One of the best""?

Her sense of humor is corny as hell. Every single joke she makes is in the same delivery of a knock knock joke. 

Here's another gem of hers:

""In the beginning there was nothing. God said, 'Let there be light!' And there was light. There was still nothing, but you could see it a whole lot better.""

Oh my god, it's comedy incarnate.

She knows how to handle herself on a stage and has been doing it long enough, but there is nothing funny about her material. At all. She appeals to a very PC and frankly, stupid audience which is exactly why her jokes go over well on her show, even if we ignore they are being told to and that's the expectation from the show's format. The entire reason she became such a household name was because of her daytime talk show which she got because of her coming out and was one of the very few celebrities, specifically women to do so at the time. She then tried making it different than most talkshows on the air by doing some silly dancing and wrote some big checks to regular people once in
A while. She was basically trying to capitalize on being a humanitarian.  

Even if she did genuinely good things for people, we now know she's a hypocrite  because when the cameras are off, she could give two fucks. She was doing it to show people what a good person she is. Not because she is one and there's a difference. The cact she made her entire workplace culture that toxic and for that many people to come out about it is revealing enough if her true character.

Aside from being a hypocrite, her show still regularly is a daytime talk show ffs that glorifies celebrities and celebrity gossip, shamelessly promotes double standards, hocks corporate crap products, and is cheap, tasteless entertainment meant for middle aged women with nothing better to do.

Again, ignoring all of that she's just simply not funny. You can fairly argue humor is subjective, but if you find her jokes funny you'll probably split your sides over unpurposefullly bad dad jokes."

Hollywood is the city of broken dreams. This was the job that lure in those people with those big dreams. The big dream of working on T.V. Sure being an unpaid intern sucks now but if I work hard and brown nose the boss maybe he will see I have potential and move me up type of dream.

5410,2020-10-07 14:23:42,j6lvx8,"Couple thoughts (unrelated but maybe??) - 

1. Why she continues to do the show - as long as she isn't hit with lawsuits and the network is ok with her ratings, she's going to keep going.  David Letterman was actually hit with a lawsuit and he kept doing his show.  Ellen wanting to do her show is simply a character trait of highly ambitious people.  A lot of these household names we know in celebrity-ville worked very hard to get to where they are...it's not as easy as a light switch to just walk away from it all.  They have ambitions just like us.  I've learned that people who have made a lot of money in their life usually want one thing...more money.  The ambition of continuing to work hard because they learned that's how you become successful isn't something that just goes away.  I know someone who is not a celebrity, but a businessman who easily could've walked away years, if not a decade ago...but doesn't because the ambition of R&D, creating new technology is what keeps him going...AND, I believe there is a fear that if you do walk away, especially after something you've done for 40 or 50 years, you just might be afraid death may come soon after, so you keep working.
2. As far as the issues that stemmed from her show, look I get that it starts at the top.  But she wasn't the one who was the aggressor in every story.  In fact, most of the stories point to her assistants, and managers backstage.  This isn't excusing Ellen.  She either created an environment of fear by not being approachable (if level 1 person was having a problem with level 2 person, and Ellen is level 3 person, level 1 person should feel comfortable approaching level 3 person about level 2 person)...apparently that was not the case.  But, rarely are things every exactly as HR would want them to be.  I imagine they cleaned house on the level 2 people, required everyone, including ellen, to go through sensitivity training, maybe a little harassment/sexual harrassment training, and move on.  I hate to say it but something like this is probably not going to take down a highly successful and profitable company/show like ellen has proven to be.  So you fix the problems and you move on."
5411,2020-10-07 14:01:53,j6lvx8,"I think it‚Äôs way more wanting to stay in the spotlight then it is wanting to keep working. Like, way more. Jennifer Aniston also shows up in movies a shit ton more then her co stars. Some people love the attention more then the money."

I feel like this problem is going to fade over time. It's a very ""boomer"" and gen x problem. Retiring and not knowing what to do other work because they can't develop any hobbies.

5424,2020-10-07 14:19:01,j6lvx8,"NBC is just as to blame as Leno. NBC was forced to choose between keeping Leno or honoring their deal with Conan, and instead tried to do both. Both had contracts due up. ABC and Fox were both interested in either host for their own possible late night show (or combination of late night shows). NBC was scared to lose either Host to a competitor, but they were more scared about losing Leno, who at the time was the number 1 late night host. 

For those who don‚Äôt know: NBC gave the Tonight Show to Conan, and signed Leno to a new deal for a 10p show. Ratings for both shows took a dive, especially the 10p Leno show. Typically, 10p is a slot used for popular dramas, and is a huge driver of rating for the 11p local news. The local affiliates were very angry that the rating for Leno‚Äôs 10p show were low that many starting talking about dropping the show from their local lineup. 

At this point, NBC really panicked and pitched the idea of moving Leno‚Äôs 10p show to 11:30p and move the Tonight Show from its traditional 11:30p slot to 12:30a. Conan didn‚Äôt want to do that, and said so publicly. End the end, NBC bought out Conan‚Äôs contract. Conan ended up with his own late night show on TBS, ironically bumping George Lopez‚Äôs show back an hour (George Lopez‚Äôs show was eventually cancelled less than a year later). 

Leno moved back to the Tonight Show and the ratings (and advertisers) came back with him. He eventually returned the show to number 1 over Letterman again, something Conan was unable to do. 

This all took place over about 7 months."

5480,2020-10-07 16:09:07,j6lvx8,"For me I feel like current Ellen and past Ellen who made headlines with her show and coming out are two totally different people. Young Ellen was funny. Young Ellen was brave and ballsy. She seemed more likeable then. Not saying she wasn't possibly bitchy behind the scenes of course because hey maybe she was but she at least had a charismatic, fresh funny and brave to come out as a gay vibe about her. I can respect that.

But modern Ellen is just a totally different person all around. Her humour isn't funny anymore it's just tame suburban mom safe jokes, mean pranks against her guests or crew and for someone with sooo much money she seems bitter and annoyed to still be doing this shit.  Even her stand up she did recently I think was just kind meh. Then just retire. Take the insane amount of money you are worth Ellen and take your wife and go live in quiet peace in some mansion in America or Europe you can afford to do so without every worrying about money. It's like that young charismatic Ellen is just gone. She almost kind of reminds of a real life Krusty the Klown from the Simpsons.

5484,2020-10-07 17:28:38,j6lvx8,Not to mention if the only thing people have on her is that she is an asshole then who fucking cares?
5485,2020-10-07 16:36:39,j6lvx8,">this is nothing compared to the backlash she got when her character came out as gay in her sitcom in the 90s

Straight up BS. Mainstream media raved about Ellen's deicsion to come out. Oprah even appeared on the come out episode. 

> Her coming out killed her career for almost a decade until she finally landed her talk show deal.  

More BS. 'Ellen' the sitcom never worked. The coming out episode kept it going for a few more years. The show was finally cancelled in 1998. Ellen landed ANOTHER SITCOM just three years later, then she landed the talk show in 2002. If her career was killed for 'almost a dead' then I'd love to see what success is. 

It stinks of 'shill work' when people try to create these narratives and imagine Ellen as some sort of victim."
5486,2020-10-07 17:01:25,j6lvx8,"For those of us who remember the '90's, no one cared.  She tried to make it a big deal and everyone just shrugged."

5493,2020-10-07 14:47:37,j6lvx8,He did an AMA a while back. Reading through that might be a good start
5494,2020-10-07 18:15:56,j6lvx8,that is some funny film but Beckham plays it so well
5495,2020-10-07 19:22:56,j6lvx8,"The sitcom he co-wrote and was in called Gavin & Stacey is absolutely brilliant.  As annoying as he I find him he deserves every bit of success that came from it.  It pretty much launched him in the UK.  I'm not sure how he got so blown up in America but fair play to him, he's done well for himself."
5496,2020-10-07 19:49:08,j6lvx8,"I'm not attacking either of them. I will say though. That to call what either of them do,  ""greatness,"" is probably a pretty big reach. I think what you really mean is successful. And I can see that, sure. Just because you're an asshole doesn't mean you're necessarily also a terrible person. As long as you don't cross certain lines.  It just means you're an asshole."
5497,2020-10-07 15:57:14,j6lvx8,"I‚Äôm not Ellen‚Äôs typical demographic but would tune in from time to time with my wife. When the news broke, I was fine with not watching again but decided to tune in to see her apology. Whooo boy did that solidify my decision. She never once denied it and instead blamed it on her growing as a person. 

I‚Äôm sorry but that excuse goes out the window when we‚Äôre talking about basic human decency coming from a 50+ old person. You‚Äôre old enough at that point that you know better. Bye bye Ellen."
5498,2020-10-07 18:47:06,j6lvx8,"I watched Ellen occasionally because although I'm not the demographic my wife quite liked it.  Not really being a fan myself, I didn't get much out of it, but I think part of its appeal is that it creates a temporary feel good bubble that cheers people up for an hour.  After all the toxic workplace stuff came out the bubble has popped and I don't think it can be un-popped.  Anecdotally, my wife doesn't want to watch it all now."
5499,2020-10-07 20:45:04,j6lvx8,I would recommend the Kelly Clarkson show. I hear behind the scenes she‚Äôs amazing and it shows in her interviews with both celebs and regular people

I'm in the same boat; one of my sisters used to watch her comedy specials when we were young and oh my God I could not stand it, so fucking corny you could sell it as gas alternative. I never minded any of the other comedians she liked through the years (even that unfortunate Dane Cook period where she had one or two of his albums stuck on repeat), but Ellen was like... Listening to a shitty Norm Macdonald impersonator who didn't *get* what makes Norm funny."

Letterman comes off as a guy who is very talented and incredibly funny, yet at the same time a person absolutely nobody wants to be anywhere around."
5534,2020-10-07 21:36:29,j6lvx8,"Yeah, but it's complicated. He did have affairs with women who worked for him.  The power dynamic makes them inherently shady, but he was never accused of impropriety by any of them.  We found out about it when a producer, Joe Halderman, attempted to blackmail him over the affairs.  Letterman fessed up to everything on air and made amends with his family. Not saying what he did wasn't bad, but he handled it all with a rarely seen class.  In the grander scheme of creeps working in Hollywood (and in late night), Letterman's issues seem rather trifling."
5535,2020-10-07 17:59:12,j6lvx8,"She's part of managing the employees. I don't mean management as a literal paperwork department, I mean management as a role where you're in charge of people and they expect you to lead them. I should have said something like leadership instead."

If I could muster 5% interest I'd pull in 100k a year, some of which I could reinvest since I don't actually need that much (I've lived most of my life at less than half that wage).  I'd be set for life.  I just don't understand the appeal of fancy stuff for its own sake.  At $100k salary I'd still have pretty nice things and go on vacations and everything.

Dude was like 70 and I asked why he doesn‚Äôt just retire.  The guy had a wife in her 30s and like a 5 year old kid.  So I guess there‚Äôs that angle.

5593,2020-10-07 14:18:29,j6lvx8,"If you go to the Tonight Show ride at Universal studios they have this room with little exhibits for each host decorated like their set and all that. There‚Äôs a very tiny Conan one in between the two Leno exhibits, it was kind of funny"
5594,2020-10-07 14:51:42,j6lvx8,"It made for a great first ever joke for Jimmy Fallon when he started hosting the tonight show.    

""I'm Jimmy Fallon and I'm your new host, for now."""
5595,2020-10-07 14:45:31,j6lvx8,Jay leno is still rich tho and doing pretty well. You've seen his car show lol
5596,2020-10-07 13:50:53,j6lvx8,What did jay leno do?
5597,2020-10-07 18:25:31,j6lvx8,"It was more like he was forcibly retired. He didn't want to quit, but NBC thought they could increase the ratings by getting someone that could expand to younger audiences. Conan didn't improve the ratings and it was too late to switch back, so they gave Leno a new show as a lead in. 

There is a lot to not like about Leno, but this is not one of them. There is no reason he needs to hold an allegiance to the format of a show that he got fired from (technically, it was a non-renewal of a contract, but it is essentially the same thing when the position stays open.)"
5598,2020-10-07 13:48:59,j6lvx8,"Wow, I completely missed that Leno is a cunt now, what happened?

Never have watched him though, only saw him on like parody shows, Simpsons, Futurama, etc."
5599,2020-10-07 14:28:58,j6lvx8,"Aside from the O‚ÄôBrien stuff, Leno was merciless in his mockery of Monica Lewinsky. Some 21 year old kid who either had made a mistake and/or was on the wrong side of the most extreme power imbalance in the world."
5600,2020-10-07 13:52:28,j6lvx8,"What did Leno do? I always enjoyed him on The Tonight Show, and since enjoy his YouTube content. Genuinely curious as I don't get the same vibes from him as Ellen."
5601,2020-10-07 16:21:56,j6lvx8,Hahaha true
5602,2020-10-07 14:28:51,j6lvx8,Actually you‚Äôre right ok well a hobby or go back to stand up try to learn how to be funny again something other than tv and kids
5603,2020-10-07 14:21:32,j6lvx8,probably took you longer to type that comment than it would have to get to the controversy section on his wikipedia page.

5605,2020-10-07 15:57:30,j6lvx8,"She does an amazing job of connecting with her audience and making them think they are seeing the real her.  People *want* to see the good in others, so they don't look for the bad when there doesn't *seem* to be any.  However, I had heard these rumors for a very long time and I'm just a yokel on the east coast. The truth was milling about for a while before the lid really got blown off."

5608,2020-10-07 21:08:58,j6lvx8,"Oh god that episode is pure cringe. It's so bad. When she went up to try to wake that poor sleeping baby and she had the micophone or megaphone in her hand and Michelle Obama bless her heart just looked like she wanted to die for filming this bit. Michelle had to stop her from waking up a sleeping and screaming or making noises in it's face. The look of Michelle freeing that mother from the bit so she could take her baby out was just wow. Poor Michelle. And poor mother to that baby. 

I mean wtf Ellen you are a grown ass adult why are you trying to wake up a baby and write on it? God forbid Michelle hadn't been there to call her shit out and make her stop. We all know the Ellen crew is to scared of her to say anything at the time anyway so they wouldn't have stopped her. Michelle was the real only adult in that situation who was like wtf is Ellen for real right now uh no don't wake up that baby or write it on run mommy run get out of here with your baby. Ellen meanwhile just stood there looking pissed her bit got ruined trying to play it off like she was just joking and wouldn't do it. Oh you know she was probably going to do if it Michelle wasn't around to be the sane one."
5609,2020-10-08 01:56:48,j6lvx8,That was some funny shit
5610,2020-10-07 14:01:56,j6lvx8,he's pretty shitty

He‚Äôll probably tell you he‚Äôs not a conservative or a member of the alt-right because he supports gay marriage and likes weed, but it can‚Äôt hide the fact that he spends time and makes movies with people who espouse some absolutely vile things."
5612,2020-10-07 16:18:46,j6lvx8,"He's a pretty shitty person. 

I used to be a huge fan and was a daily listener to his podcast up until like 3 or 4 years ago (possibly more, it all kind of blends together). I'll still say the guy can be really fucking funny when he's on. But that became more and more rare as time went on. The problem is he has grown more bitter about everything and has a huge victim complex. He thinks his movies and docs don't get enough love because Hollywood hates him, when in reality, they're just not very good. 

He's also surrounded himself with yes men and talks about the same shit over and over. He's basically alienated a lot of people in his sphere because he has indeed become more right wing on top of telling everyone how much smarter he is than they are. He's a narcissist and plays the victim.  

But that doesn't mean he's wrong about Ellen.

Edit: a word"
5613,2020-10-07 18:01:11,j6lvx8,"Friend of mine was his assistant for awhile. 

Consensus seemed to be that he‚Äôs an interpersonally nice and generous guy, but that he believes and says some really awful shitty things."
5614,2020-10-07 14:02:42,j6lvx8,Nah he's definitely shitty.
5615,2020-10-07 14:29:48,j6lvx8,Very shitty. It is known.
5616,2020-10-07 18:12:45,j6lvx8,"Nah Carolla is an asshole too. After the debacle with his ex partner Donnie it pretty much showed the kind of greedy selfish asshole Adam was.  But he's added so many things to that pile of reasons he's an asshole that at this point, its well established."

Most of the world agrees with him that woke culture in the U.S. is fucking looney."
5618,2020-10-07 14:29:00,j6lvx8,"You can genuinely love to do something and not want to do it 24/7.  That's not faking it.

Also, Ellen herself explained years ago (when she was still likeable) she once randomly started dancing at the beginning of the episode and people *loved it.* She found it funny, and thought it was a good way to start the show with a playful and positive energy, so she continued doing it. At some point it became both a tradition and kind of a running gag.  It never was a I JUST LOVE DANCING SO MUCH I HAVE TO DO IT EVERYDAY.

I've never been a fan of the show but using the fact she didn't dance this one time as proof of how shitty she is is just idiotic."

5620,2020-10-07 14:45:58,j6lvx8,so she's an actor? go figure.  not sure why anyone thinks this is different from other TV hosts.
5621,2020-10-07 14:34:01,j6lvx8,"I mean... I love to dance too, but I can't say I've danced at every wedding I've been too. I also love pizza but sometimes don't eat it. This is easily the dumbest piece of evidence. She might be a shit stain of a human, but this isn't evidence of that."
5622,2020-10-07 17:14:26,j6lvx8,Dancing during the intro was just something she did in the early seasons that became her thing. She stopped doing it years ago
5623,2020-10-07 22:12:31,j6lvx8,Wtf why are you doubling down lol that‚Äôs the absolute dumbest reason to think less of her
5624,2020-10-07 14:09:15,j6lvx8,"His example is Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell had a fake television personality and turned out to be total terrible person in real life. Same with Bill Cosby.

5629,2020-10-07 16:59:18,j6lvx8,So many people commenting on how terrible she is on her show who apparently have never seen her show
5630,2020-10-07 14:21:06,j6lvx8,"How does that comment or the upvotes imply that they or the upvoters are using just that to believe it‚Äôs truth? The commenter relayed a story. People found the story constructive to the conversation (probably because it‚Äôs slightly funny) so they upvoted. 

They didn‚Äôt say l‚ÄùAdam Corolla said this so you know her whole personality is false‚Äù he relayed a story Adam told which said Adam thinks she‚Äôs false. Very different situations."
5631,2020-10-07 12:41:11,j6lvx8,Dude she‚Äôs hardly the only one who doesn‚Äôt like her job but still does it for the money
5632,2020-10-07 13:42:47,j6lvx8,"I didn‚Äôt say it was that way for sure, but she‚Äôs a human just as we all are. Insulting her because she didn‚Äôt dance at a party is crazy, and I like Adam Corolla more than most Hollywood people. Easily like him more than Ellen."
5633,2020-10-07 16:59:56,j6lvx8,"Oh I'm completely against the ""cancel everything"" mentality, I just think this underscores the importance of people who have such an influential public presence putting in the work to understand what's going on ""beneath"" them to make it all possible.  In the midst of a global pandemic shutting down your show, maybe at least try to find out if all the hundreds of people supporting your show are OK while you restart production from your multimillion dollar home knowing they can't go in to work.

In Ellen's case I'm not entirely up to speed on it but I get the impression that this whole HR controversy really stirred up a more general awareness that Ellen's sense of humor is a little bit mean spirited and her own personality may not fall entirely in line with her ""be kind"" motto and public persona, and once people started dwelling on that, her show appeals to people less than it once did.  Which may explain her ratings taking a hit."
5634,2020-10-07 19:30:24,j6lvx8,It sucks because if he becomes the host of the Tonight Show 6 or 7 years later I think he connects with the younger audience more. There were a lot more older viewers that didnt like him or his humor. I used to think Conan wasnt funny when he was made the host but some years later my entire viewpoint changed. He got screwed by Leno also

5638,2020-10-07 21:10:23,j6lvx8,I agree. I used to really love her. The early days when Comedy Central showed tons of stand up. I remember seeing her and Chapelle and Mitch and thinking they just had pure funny bones. Ellen used to be sharp in the best way.
5639,2020-10-07 15:00:36,j6lvx8,That AMA is weird.  It's just one story from a server and Reddit commenters thinking they're the first ones to make a fat joke about James Corden.  What's funny is Corden likely never even saw the thread.

This seems a bit melodramatic, considering he worked with people actively for decades.  You'll find just as many people gushing about working with Letterman as you will those gossiping in Carter's books.  The truth, I imagine, lies somewhere in between.  

I don't think Letterman's personality was for everyone. He liked to perform, but wasn't social in the way people expect Hollywood types to be. I have no doubt he was as moody and self-obsessed, but there seems like there's a humility to him you don't find in people like Carson."

He blew up on youtube with his skits, abroad shows, clueless gamer, and Jordan Shlanksky/Sonia bits. At the time, he didn't have that 21-30 audience, nor did he have the 55+.

but later on he said that was not true 
tbs had just told him to say that"
5734,2020-10-07 14:36:11,j6lvx8,"That requires some history. Way back in the early 90s Johnny Carson announced that he was retiring from The Tonight Show. His expected replacement, as seen by both the audience and Carson, was David Letterman who hosted Late Night afterwards. However NBC went with Leno instead (who allegedly went as far as hiding in closets so he could overhear meetings and get the job) and that blew up in their faces. Fans were upset and Letterman left in disgust to create The Late Show on CBS. While that show never beat Leno in the ratings it still meant that NBC went from having no competition in the slot to losing serious ad money to someone they had built up themselves. 

Letterman's replacement for Late Night was some unknown named Conan O'Brien. For the first 3 years he struggled, often on week to week contracts with NBC to stay on the air, but eventually the show got its grooved and exploded in popularity thanks to O'Brien's experimental sense of humor. By the early 2000s he was a major late night talent and with his contract expiring there were concerns he could go to a rival network like Fox and start something to compete against The Tonight Show the way Letterman did.

Conan himself was more interested in having a career at NBC but that required the possibility of advancement. He wanted a guarantee that he would eventually be the successor to The Tonight Show the way Leno was when Carson retired. So NBC agreed and it was announced that there would be a peaceful transition at the end of the decade, by which time Leno would have earned hundreds of millions of dollars and have hosted the show for almost two decades.

However when the transition came Leno told NBC he didn't want to leave. Executives tried to suggest that he could do a series of specials, big budget affairs in exotic locations like Bob Hope had done, but he turned it down. Then they suggested a Sunday show with a bigger budget and a full week to prepare and he didn't like that either. He wanted a nightly show and NBC was once again stuck in the spot of losing their host to Fox or another network.

So they came up with an alternative. They'd give Leno the 10pm prime time slot. This meant NBC would be losing in the ratings since Leno wouldn't be able to compete with the likes of CSI and other prime time dramas but they reasoned that with the much lower production costs it would balance out.

In the beginning both shows had to find their footing with The Tonight Show dropping in the ratings (and Leno premiering far below the shows he replaced). But while NBC could easily wait for Conan to pick up they faced a serious backlash over Leno. You see between the 10-11pm slot of Leno and the 11:35pm slot of Conan there was the local news. This is a big thing for affiliates because of the local ad revenue and so they noticed real fast when the viewers started turning off their TV at 10pm instead of watching a prime time drama that left it on long enough for the nightly news to start and get them hooked on another half hour of ads.

With affiliates screaming in NBC's ear they had no choice but to remove Leno from the 10pm slot. Only now they were back at the problem of Leno going to Fox and so they tried a third solution. They tried to abuse a clause for unscheduled pre-empting and announced they'd put Leno's show at 11:35pm (shortening it to 30 minutes) and pushing The Tonight Show into the next day at 12:05am. Conan wasn't having that and after a public fight (that was very lopsided in favor of Conan since he was something of the comedian's comedian while Leno was widely hated as an asshole who would sabotage someone's career on the off chance that it would earn him another dollar) it was announced that NBC would pay off Conan's contract to the tune of many millions and give The Tonight Show back to Leno."

He should have stepped down, for next up Conan but he wouldn‚Äôt leave when it was clear his time was done. Ellen‚Äôs not being replaced but same comment applies to her in my opinion and I just said it"
5736,2020-10-07 14:09:32,j6lvx8,"It was the mess with Conan, Leno rushing back to replace Conan at the first possible moment. Dave Letterman talked about it on his show quite a few times. You can start with this, for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZh5LbS3jA0
 
Edit: The point is that Leno was supposed to be out and make room for the next ""generation"" which was long ago decided to be Conan (was it five years or so before and he even announced it in his show back then), but he just had to come back and end Conan's era before he managed to find the best show by him."

NBC has two shows: the Tonight Show (11:30 PM) and Late Night (12:30 AM). Originally, in the early 80s, Johnny Carson hosted the Tonight Show and David Letterman hosted Late Night. Johnny Carson was kind of the legendary trailblazing king of late night television, and everyone dreams of having his seat, hosting the Tonight Show.

When Carson retired, Letterman was passed over for the Tonight Show and the hosting spot went to Jay Leno instead. This was seen as a real slap in the face to Letterman, who then left NBC and Late Night for a new show on CBS called The Late Show which went against the Tonight Show at 11:30 PM. This set up a long running feud/competition between Leno and Letterman.

Conan O'Brien, a writer for Saturday Night Live, was tapped to take David Letterman's place at Late Night. O'Brien had some success with a younger viewing audience. After years with Leno on the Tonight Show at 11:30 and O'Brien at Late Night at 12:30, O'Brien started getting offers to take his show to other networks, but like anyone would, really wanted to one day follow in Johnny Carson's footsteps and be the host of the Tonight Show. So as the story goes, he went to NBC out of loyalty, looking for a guarantee that he'd one day get the job. They worked out an agreement where Leno would retire in 5 years and the Tonight Show would be passed on to O'Brien.

Five years came. O'Brien was given the Tonight Show, and Jimmy Fallon was hired to take over Late Night. Leno didn't want to retire and NBC really didn't want to loose him to another network. So they created a new show for Leno at 10:00 PM--- a primetime spot--- that would lead-in to the Tonight Show. This was kind of an experiment: primetime spots are typically reserved for weekly dramas and comedies, and not nightly talk shows. The show did not do well in the ratings, and as a result, The Tonight Show arguably suffered in the ratings as well. This looked bad for O'Brien. Realizing the whole thing was a disaster, NBC proposed keeping O'Brien on the Tonight Show, but moving it 12:00 PM, and then cuting Leno's new show to a half-hour and moving it back to 11:30 PM. O'Brien didn't want to move. On top of simply wanting the 11:30 PM slot, he thought it was insult to the Tonight Show to move it back to 12:00 AM. So NBC ended up firing O'Brien and putting Leno back on the Tonight Show.

O'Brien moved to TBS with a new show at 11:00 PM called Conan. When Leno retired a few years later, the Tonight Show went to Jimmy Fallon. All the while, Letterman has been on CBS on The Late Show against the Tonight Show at 11:30 PM, until his retirement this week.

Jay Leno is now seen as having ""screwed over"" two beloved hosts of Late Night in his career. How much of that was really Leno's doing is hard to say, but he's had a negative perception for it, particularly among younger audiences, since both Letterman and O'Brien had younger audiences in their heyday (although both their audiences have aged). All of this leads to people making a much bigger deal over Letterman's retirement than Leno. Plus, he'd kind of retired once already."

5814,2020-10-08 02:37:01,j6lvx8,"> You'll find just as many people gushing about working with Letterman as you will those gossiping in Carter's books.

Considering the list of interviewees in Carter's books, including both Letterman and Leno themselves, you're being seriously disingenuous by calling them ""gossip"". Those books are the gold standard for documentation of the struggle over late night post-Carson.

As for Letterman's personality, you will rarely, if ever, find people who worked with him who won't use some variation of the terms prickly, depressive, obsessive, etc. They will virtually all extol his talent as a virtue, but just about nobody will state he's a joy to work with. Even Peter Lassally only lasted a few years with Dave. He was one of many to receive Letterman's favorite treatment for those who had disappointed him in some way, where he wouldn't fire somebody, he'd just refuse to speak to them or involve them in any way, sometimes for *years* at a time. Dave himself relates an anecdote where Johnny Carson, Letterman's idol, when finding out they owned properties close to each other in California, suggested they should get together. Dave's response? ""For what?"" Everything I've ever read about Letterman, and it's a lot, suggests a man closer to Larry David's TV persona than anything else.

> He liked to perform, but wasn't social in the way people expect Hollywood types to be. 

Actually, according to Letterman and many around him, he generally hated to perform. He felt driven to do it, of course, but his post-show autopsies of his performances were noted to be constantly brutal and self-flagellating, not only towards himself, but anyone around him.

I'm not picking on Dave. Guy's a genius, and his legacy is assured, but let's not paint him as anything approaching a nice man or a good boss during the Late Night/Late Show years. He seems to have changed quite a bit since he retired from the Late Show, but that doesn't make his behavior any better. Contrast this with somebody like Leno, who nobody's gonna call a genius (Except for Letterman, oddly enough), but kept a writer's room and producing staff happy and almost completely intact for nearly two decades. Genius is often a pill to be around, and it's a rare talent at Letterman's level who's fun to be in a room with."

That all imploded when Leno took the show back."

5853,2020-10-07 17:42:56,j6lvx8,"> While that show never beat Leno in the ratings it still meant that NBC went from having no competition in the slot to losing serious ad money to someone they had built up themselves. 

Good summary, but this one detail is incorrect.  Letterman led in the ratings for the first two years until Leno's infamous interview with Hugh Grant where he discussed cheating on Elizabeth Hurley with a prostitute.  Leno led from then on.  That likely fed into NBC's fear of losing either Conan or Leno.  While Leno did eventually overtake Letterman, it's not everyday a celebrity cheats on his wife and is willing to publicly discuss it. They knew there was a very real risk of Leno losing out to Conan if he went to FOX, especially since one of the reasons they wanted Conan to takeover in the first place was because they wanted to appeal to a younger (and more lucrative to advertisers) audience."

5856,2020-10-07 20:23:48,j6lvx8,Didn't Letterman demand more money then Leno did? After the Hugh Grant interview Leno won the ratings so in the long run NBC made the correct decision. Worst thing you have ever done segment on Kimmel was pretty funny with Leno

5859,2020-10-07 16:04:28,j6lvx8,"So, your description is loaded with bias.  I like Conan as a person but I've never found him to be funny.  His ""experimental"" comedy just never hit with me.  Same with Letterman.  I literally can't stand him, I think he's a pompous ass.  Having said all that, I thought Leno was not an amazing replacement for Carson, but honestly, no one really would have been.  The man was one of the best we've ever seen at that job.  In our current age of late night hosts, the only person who entertains me on the same level is Graham Norton but he only does it once a week.  I actually think the format for a nightly talk show should be retired.  It has migrated away from focusing on the guests and just being a sketch show with 15 minutes of uber-rehearsed, talking-points-only guest interactions. And the sketches aren't anything special.

Craig Ferguson was pretty funny but he was sometimes a little too experimental and odd with his guests.  I'd still put him ahead of Leno, Letterman or O'Brien."
5860,2020-10-07 16:33:53,j6lvx8,"There's one thing you have wrong that throws alot of bias into it.

Leno was TOLD that he would be turning over the show to Conan in X years and retiring. He didn't pull a Brett Favre and flip flop, he had the highest ratings and was pushed out. You cant blame him when the opportunity to keep his job he took it."
5861,2020-10-07 17:28:15,j6lvx8,"I disagree that Leno‚Äôs time was done.

When he returned to the Tonight Show, he also returned the ratings and the show became number 1 again. When Leno did retire, the show was still number 1 over Letterman. If anything, Leno proved to NBC that they should have retained him all along."
5862,2020-10-07 15:21:33,j6lvx8,">The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien and The Jay Leno Show failed to attract immediate viewers, and NBC affiliates, seeing their viewership decline, grew restless. NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Zucker, alongside chairman Jeff Gaspin and executive Rick Ludwin, created a remedy: move Leno back to his 11:35 pm start time and bump O'Brien a half-hour later, to 12:05 am. O'Brien and his staff were disappointed and furious; when it became clear O'Brien would not agree to the proposed changes, the situation grew heated. Though not a breach of either host's contract, the change resulted in a public outcry and public demonstrations largely in support of O'Brien.

Sounds like the network played a pretty big part in the conflict."
5863,2020-10-07 14:50:43,j6lvx8,Conan actually hosted the tonight show for a few months. He moved his entire staff from New York to LA. Leno tried to do a prime time show but the ratings were bad. Ultimately nbc paid Conan 45 million to go away and Leno got his show back.
5864,2020-10-07 14:14:42,j6lvx8,"He also originally stole The Tonight Show from Letterman, who was doing Late Night at the time.  So basically the guy fucked 2 different people over the same show"
5865,2020-10-07 14:43:40,j6lvx8,"Everything you just said is incorrect. LMAO. NBC resigned Leno and Conan to new 5 yr agreements with the understanding that at the end of Leno's agreement, Conan would take over the tonight show (he was then hosting the show after the tonight show). When that time came, NBC was nervous that FOX was going to hire Leno to create a late night show for them that would compete with the tonight show. So they gave Leno a show at 10 EST and Conan took over the tonight show. Both Leno and Conan had bad ratings. So they wanted to move Leno to 11:30 EST and move the tonight show to 12:00 EST. Conan said no. NBC did a settlement with Conan and his staff and let him go. Leno took the Tonight Show back over, did it for another 5 years with the understanding that at the end of it, Jimmy Fallon (who had taken over the show after the tonight show) would take over the tonight show.

This time, to keep Leno from jumping to another network, they gave him a rich guy car show on CNBC which seems to have been doing quite well. I think he is already like 5 seasons in. I think Leno is also on Tim Allen's show on FOX as well."
5866,2020-10-07 16:57:33,j6lvx8,"There's a few more details than that.

Leno had agreed (in 2004) to give the Tonight Show to Conan in 2009. This came to pass. NBC was impatient with Conan's establishing himself in the spot as his ratings weren't at Leno's levels. NBC gives Leno a prime time talk show (which also tanks and pulls the following news broadcasts on local stations down). So NBC wants to put Leno's talk show at the Tonight Show time slot and push everyone down an hour. Conan thought this was a bad idea and stepped away from hosting the Tonight Show and then Leno came and swooped back in for a couple years.

It was real shit show at the time. As much as (although a bit different) than when Leno got the Tonight Show initially from Johnny Carson when Carson wanted it to go to David Letterman.


*edit - Someone gave WAY more details than I put a few comments down so read that."
5867,2020-10-07 16:17:13,j6lvx8,"With the modern era of YouTube etc., I think it worked out for Conan. I tend to watch a lot of his stuff online now, including all the classic episodes. He's got a good format now, the TV show is almost secondary to the online collection. More creative control as well, I'm guessing.

Leno's car show is pretty good, he's in his element in any case. I think he's an asshole, but he knows cars. Sucks that he probably got the idea from Seinfeld (but then Seinfeld's not the best human either, nor is Letterman, so whaddayagonna do.) There's room for a variety of car and comedy shows."

I don't think anything I read comes close to what's going on with Ellen. I didn't read anywhere that Jay treated his employees like garbage, or was an asshole to fans off camera, etc.

It sucks, and it tarnishes my opinion of him a bit, but Ellen is on another level, sorry."

The sentiment was invented decades ago because people didn't like that they couldn't do things like use the N word, grope women, or molest the step-kids without consequence any more. So they invented and then blamed ""political correctness"" instead of their own behavior.

People continually griping about that sort of thing are just mad they can't be assholes without getting called out for it.

I think around the time he fired Alison was about when I started getting tired of him also. Not to mention his bullshit with David Wilde and Matt Atchity. Adam used to call out everyone on their shit, but he stopped doing that with people on the right. 

And yeah, the same thing he did with DAG he's done with Jay Mohr, Cesario, Jo Koy and countless others. He finds one thing funny and then just beats it into the ground...because *he* finds it funny.

Donny Also had money Invested in to the company and Adam ho no intention of giving any of it back. He tried to Grift Donny.

I'm going to quote another Redditor because they said exactly how I saw it.

>Donny and his family got screwed by Adam.  
>  
>Adam  made a verbal contract creating a 'company' that involved partners.   When the 'real money' was on the horizon, Adam realized that he did not  want to split the fortune and turned the story into Donny being an  employee that he had to fire because of being 'hard to work with'.  
>  
>When  Adam's radio contract ended - he had no gig - and so relied on many of  his 'friends' to help him with content but he failed to compensate his  friends; either by asking for guest favors or promising 'future  earnings' and then backing out.  
>  
>The  Court papers were very telling.  The Judge ruled that a jury would  decide the partnership and compensation.  Adam only settled right before  he was to publicly state his income on the stand - that and the Judge  limited the time for profit calculations to when the partnership  dissolved - which limited Donny's profits.  
>  
>Adam had radio contract money - Donny was living off of savings.  
>  
>Adam was influenced by Mike August and sort of pushed Donny out of the picture.  
>  
>That is my take from listening and reading both sides.  
>  
>Adam  is a Machiavellian type character and twists history to suit his  version of events.  The Alison ending was similar and his version  doesn't put him in the right in that one either.

And for millennials at the time, it felt so earnest and unfair that people literally showed up outside NBC studios and protested. Conan himself didn't seem to expect it. And the other late night hosts like Letterman and Kimmel would spend time on their own shows roasting Leno for his part in it. Leno kept trying to deflect all blame to NBC that he never wanted to give up the Tonight Show, and was forced by NBC, and that he would have just taken another network offer if they didn't come up with the 10pm show scheme. But his critics just kept reminding him that he should have kept his original promise and peacefully passed the torch. NBC probably realized the public outcry was a vocal minority (at least according to Nielson ratings) because they never budged. Conan negotiated an exit from the show. But those final shows were some of my favorite tv moments of all time. One of the most stale television formats still in use was invigorated. The crowd was passionate. The crew made irrelevant bits about the situation very much effecting them (a recurring joke was trying to waste as much of NBC's money as possible). The guests were from friends or show regulars not caring about what they had to promote. The host was dealing with simultaneously coping with prematurely losing his dream job and an outpouring of public compassion. And that final episode I cried my eyes out while he gave a speech telling the world how lucky he was."

In particular, there is the ability to conduct a good interview.  It doesn't need to be an in-depth probe into the inner workings of the subject's psyche.  There are talk show hosts who can do insightful interviews in that way, including Letterman, Craig Ferguson, John Stewart (if it's a guest he's interested in), Sean Evans, etc.

But there are also those who are able to quickly build an empathic rapport with guests, make them feel welcome and have an entertaining conversation even if (perhaps especially if) it's not deep.  Jimmy Fallon, for all his other faults, is actually really good at this.  Merv Griffin and Regis Philbin were masters at it.  Ellen is also really good at it, which is probably the main reason her show has been on the air for 18 freaking years.

Adam is not the type of guy to back down. His lawsuit against the Patton trolls for example: After he had the case thrown out, he started a go fund me and went after them.

&#x200B;

> both had plenty of opportunity to make a written contract 

That was Foolish on Donny's part but I can understand why a contract never happened. They were good friends since childhood and they both had financial security and he probably didn't think Adam would one day take an assholes side over his and kick him to the curb. (It's been discussed that Mike August's personality is known to piss people off and some think he's an asshole, as did Donny)

We've all heard Adam talk about how he hates to sign things thinking its ridiculous that everything needs a signature on a contract because no one wants to get sued. There was a story a while back regarding the warehouse rent. The Guy Adam bought the Warehouse from wanted Adam to sign something since he was moving into the warehouse early and Adam wouldn't do it. He refused and said his word and a handshake was good enough. It's not a far reach to think he did the same thing to Donny.

Fortunately for Donny, California recognizes 'verbal contracts' and allows a parties actions to dictate common sense/truths that happen between businessmen which is why Donny won. 

The rest of this has nothing to do with the Lawsuit but since I'm on a roll: 

In my view it was one of the first examples of how poorly Adam can treat people. 

Donny wasn't a Yes man, Neither was Ray and Ray would call him on his shit. Alison didn't kiss his ass like Brian does. He also stopped having regular guests who dared to disagree with him like David Wilde and Matt Atchity. There's seems to be a trend here. 

""Pirate ship my ass. It's more like a slave ship and he keeps cracking that whip and threatening to throw you overboard if you don't paddle faster than everyone else"" - Ray Oldhafer said that on another show just before Adam no longer found him useful and told him to get lost.  He expected Ray to Conform into a subservient yes man and then got rid of him when he realized it wasn't going to happen. When he addressed it on his show he used the same old tired speech and said, ""After I became successful all of my friends changed. They just became assholes. I don't understand it"" without realizing he's the one that changed."

The new position will also teach him hard skills in an in-demand field in database management on top of the better pay, and provide opportunities with a range of organisations down the track.

There are people who have worked in his current position for 10+ years, but they keep punching away doing service desk and arent working on the side to up-skill. My friend could potentially be earning more just because he bothered to apply.

If you can find that original run of podcasts, preferably video as I think seeing Norm makes it way better, I cannot recommend them enough. The man is brilliant and those first few seasons of his show were pure distilled comedy gold. I've never seen anything like it.

>Both Ray and Donny seemed like they were relying on their friendship to act unprofessionally.

I don't remember Adam having any complaints about Donny or reading anything about him besides the Day Adam addressed Donny's firing. As far as I know all Donny did, very early on, was made it clear that he did not Like Mike and didn't want to work with him. Instead of figuring out a solution Adam's attitude was, ""too bad"" and kept pressing it. But I get it, he considered Donny an employee piss-on and not an actual partner so he felt justified.

Ray has been the same guy since Adam knew him during childhood. He knew what he was getting when he brought him aboard. Ray is a meat and potatoes Blue Collar laborer who was generally happy with his life. He never saw Carolla Digital as a new way of life and looked at it as a fun thing to do with a good friend and he didn't quit his day job. Adam knew this and only grew tired of Ray's unpreparedness when he no longer found him useful.

It was easy for Brian to take an improv class and a stand up comedy class. His only Job was the podcast so he had free time. Ray Worked all day and would then often go straight to Adam's Studio and give an interview or do a show. Sometimes he would even do some laboring around the studio. The guy was too Burnt out to take classes and he wasn't making enough on the Podcast to quit his day job. There were some times the guy wouldn't have something prepared or he forgot something but its to be expected when he's already doing 10-12 hour days busting his ass as a construction worker frying his brain under the hot Californian sun. I was amazed he even had to energy to drive all the way to the studio a few times a week and do whatever was needed. I'm pretty sure he wasn't even paid. He definitely didn't get anything for the first few years. I know the original agreement was similar to Donny, when the profits come you'll get paid. Not sure if those profits Adam was talking about ever came.

In Regard to Alison, he was already taking almost half of the amazon revenu and then wanted more for the legal fund. She approached him and told him she was having surgery the following month and he told her it was fine. She also needed that money because she'd been having multiple surgeries and health issues and had medical bills up to her ears. Next thing she knew, she was out on her ass.

I think Matt leaving tomatoes was good timing and a good excuse for Adam to not have him back anymore. When Rode hard didn't do well and he was bitter, Adam had this idea claiming that Rotten tomatoes was politically biased only allowing left leaning directors to do well. The next time Matt Achitey was on the show Adam jumped back into his  theory, and being an employee of the site Matt wouldn't just let it go.  It  got pretty contentious, and I think that was the last time Matt was on the show.

As for David Wilde. I don't remember the mention of bad messages on Social Media, I'll take your word for it. The way I remembered it, Adam got Mad at David for not having the same world view about something and didn't even have any good counter Arguments against what David said and just kept yelling at him. Almost with a 'If I yell louder I win' vibe and he came off like a real jerk. After that, as far as I remember David never came back."

I think part of Ray's reluctance to put more in to the show could have been a frustration that he wasn't being compensated. I remember him bitching at Adam a couple of times when Adam started that, ""Lets help Ray buy a house so click on those sponsored links"" slogan he started and a couple of times Ray said to him, ""well maybe I could afford one if I was actually getting paid around here!"" Then Adam would respond with his spiel about keeping the pirate ship afloat, be patient and he'd see his end when the ship finally sets sail which is gonna be soon. 

LOL maybe He was like, fuck this why should I do more and spend my money on classes if I'm not even getting paid. I guess the real question is, was he finally getting paid? If yes, go take some classes! If no, you do you. When he went on Alison's Podcast to talk about his firing. He said even though he was fired he was going to take some classes anyway, for himself. I wonder if he signed up since he had more free time or was he making an effort too late like someone who's like, ""I can change!"" when their girlfriend dumps them.

Adam did admit on air, when he was talking about her firing that he probably could have handled it better so at least he knows she was hurt. But then he did another episode later where he talked shit about her and was deceptive about things, forcing her to defend herself (cue the link I gave earlier). After that he was on the Howard Stern show and a caller asked why she wasn't around and Adam was very forward and flat out said he just didn't want to work with her anymore, he wanted someone new. I wish he would have just said that from the beginning. I was already iffy about him with the whole Donny thing and then he did this. It really soured me on him. (lol hence my rants) Funny thing, I'm not a diehard fan of Alison or anything. I just don't like the way he treated her.

I had no idea David was having his life threatened. Not cool, but not really surprising either. Thanks."

6166,2020-10-09 13:29:09,j6lvx8,"I don‚Äôt think there is a bad guy in the Ray and Adam disagreement, just a fundamental difference in the way they saw the show. Ray saw it as like a contractor job and that there was no reason to give full time effort for a part time job. Adam thought of it like a show business job job where you put in lots of work at the beginning to create a show and if it becomes a hit you get rich. Thus they were both frustrated and didn‚Äôt have the communication ability to get on the same page.

With Alison when Adam was talking about why he fired her on his show he had some small complaints and only when he mentioned the patent troll lawsuit money did he show real emotion. What I liked about Alison on the show was the contrast of her constant anxiety and self doubt and Adam‚Äôs confidence and arrogant self belief. As someone who is more like Alison I know that the constant self questioning can sometimes get in the way of understanding other people‚Äôs concerns. So Alison was so worried about how the money loss would affect her she didn‚Äôt see how terrified Adam was that his whole business was going down. 

In general I think Adam has a huge blind spot about being a boss. He seems to think it should be an easy job where he just provides directions and then everything gets done. He doesn‚Äôt realize that being a good boss is a hard job involving understanding what motivates his employees and how to get the best out of everyone. In sports they say that the best players usually don‚Äôt make the best coaches because they don‚Äôt understand what it is like for less talented players. Adam is such a highly motivated person he has a hard time understanding regular people. Thus there is conflict and disappointment because he doesn‚Äôt understand the job."

We waited there for 30 more minutes and finally Ellen came out for like 30 seconds and said hi then went back to get changed and the guy that was the main person corralling the audience explained to us when he would signal us to laugh and such. The show started and Ellen comes out and does her little segment and then we went to commercial and instead of like taking or interacting with any of the audience she just sat there and didn‚Äôt acknowledge us. She had Sarah Paulson that day and I absolutely love Sarah Paulson do I was pretty excited and we watched the segment and when it went to commercial again Sarah got up and waved at the audience and said hi before while Ellen continued to sit there and do nothing.

6221,2020-10-07 12:45:43,j6kfs7,"Unpopular opinion but I feel like this is less about her being a ‚Äúbad person‚Äù or ‚Äúmean‚Äù and more so that she‚Äôs just not as interactive/engaging as most celebrities? She doesn‚Äôt owe anyone anything, imo. I think most people watch her show and expect her to be the ‚Äúcrazy fun lady who dances 24/7‚Äù and when they find out she‚Äôs just as human as the rest of us people shit on her. I feel like she‚Äôs held to a different standard because of her tv show ‚Äúpersona.‚Äù Yes, she branded herself that way...but people should understand that it‚Äôs still a ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù or a ‚Äúpersona.‚Äù

No one is going to be happy and engaging 24/7."
6222,2020-10-07 16:03:35,j6kfs7,What I just read in those 2 comments (original and explanation) summarized: Ellen didn‚Äôt interact with her audience during breaks at the 1 show you went to and that constitutes her being ‚Äúan evil bitch.‚Äù
6223,2020-10-07 09:57:54,j6kfs7,Why does she just sit there
6224,2020-10-07 06:40:26,j6kfs7,"He was like, ‚Äúeveryone who has met me KNOWS I DONT TALK TO PEOPLE WHO APPROACH ME!!!!!‚Äù. Much better, Andy. Lol."
6225,2020-10-07 13:13:22,j6kfs7,Hahaha!
6226,2020-10-07 11:48:34,j6kfs7,I was joking

You might see a joke flying over your head."
6228,2020-10-07 06:27:23,j6kfs7,issa joke
6229,2020-10-07 21:35:28,j6kfs7,The person I'm replying to is suggesting that there's a double standard when there isn't. All i'm doing is telling him/her that public figures of both genders are held accountable when they need to be.
6230,2020-10-07 05:23:15,j6kfs7,I posted first-hand proof. I posted a link to a thread of firsthand accounts of Nicole F being unpleasant.
6231,2020-10-07 20:58:36,j6kfs7,"Someone else made a word, nicenvy"
6232,2020-10-07 16:13:17,j6kfs7,"Right! Ellen has been doing this basically every day of her life for years and years. After a couple of years it becomes a job, and so ignoring the audience is not surprising and also not even really rude. It's Ellen's break time, and she can choose to use it however she wants."
6233,2020-10-07 15:36:52,j6kfs7,Some people just fucking hate women lmao
6234,2020-10-07 13:20:03,j6kfs7,Interesting. Guess I just got him on a good day. I had never looked up any experiences with him so I just assumed that that‚Äôs how he usually was. Thanks for telling me.
6235,2020-10-07 07:36:36,j6kfs7,"He may be rude to the staff I didn‚Äôt really pay attention to either of them interacting with their staff but based off of their interaction with the audience, James was 10x better than Ellen"

6242,2020-10-08 12:30:35,j6kfs7,Guarantee her and her grandma were sat at the back of the audience lol

6244,2020-10-07 17:12:41,j6kfs7,"I get what you‚Äôre saying but Ellen DeGeneres is not an ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù lol. She‚Äôs an actress, a celebrity, a talk show host, and a gay icon. If my job consisted of me having to act extremely happy-go-lucky and dance every day of the week, I‚Äôd spend the rest of the time being a dick too ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

6247,2020-10-07 05:32:33,j6kfs7,"Honestly, there should be. More people/BB fans should come forward with their stories of Nicole F being rude to them. And former houseguests and current/former production members need to tell us their Nicole F horror stories."
6248,2020-10-07 21:39:29,j6kfs7,It's been corroborated by so many people
6249,2020-10-08 12:48:03,j6kfs7,"Right lol? That's not Ellen's fault, it's a production decision and literally all production companies seat the hot people in the front to look good on camera."
6250,2020-10-07 13:24:51,j6kfs7,"Why ""should"" they come forward and why does production ""need"" to tell us horror stories?  This is a genuine question.   I know she used to be a nurse but she hasnt been for a while now and is just a podcaster/social media ""influencer"".  It's not like she is running for office or working with small children.  She is an insecure, self centered under 30 woman from a small town."
6251,2020-10-07 05:35:36,j6kfs7,I‚Äôm happy with that. At least it would be in one place and not everywhere.
6252,2020-10-07 15:38:29,j6kfs7,Nicole doesn't even need her $40k because she's living in your head rent free lmao. You straight up sound deranged and obsessed.
6253,2020-10-07 21:45:17,j6kfs7,It‚Äôs still hear say.
6254,2020-10-07 18:05:19,j6kfs7,"She's also a public figure who is currently on (and has been on previous seasons of) a major network, broadcast reality TV show which has gotten anywhere from 4-7 million viewers, and is, on most nights, the highest-rated program out of all the shows on ABC, NBC, CBS, and FOX. The scrutiny and the criticism that she is subjected to is all part of it."
6255,2020-10-07 17:49:46,j6kfs7,"She will need her 40K once she finds out that people are on to her phony-ass act she does for the cameras and social media, and that she's lost her sponsors. #SHOTSFIRED"
6256,2020-10-07 17:50:47,j6kfs7,"Yeah because of psychos like you who want to cancel her for laughing at a joke ü§£ I've seen your responses in this thread and you literally need therapy. You are clearly not mentally well with your obsessive, psychotic attitude."
6257,2020-10-07 17:56:16,j6kfs7,"I can stick up for REAL people like Janelle if I want to, and I can read phony people like Nicole F to filth if I want to. That's all I have to say, and whether you want to accept that fact or not is completely up to you."

I really don't know if I would think of Ellen Degeneres if I met a young Ellen. Maybe in passing. She is barely on my radar. I would not think that the name was chosen to be after her, though. Your daughter will be her own person so people are not going to associate her with Ellen Degeneres. 

If you name your kid Beyonc√© or Zendaya, then yes, I'm thinking that the celebrity figured into the name at least. But Ellen is an old name with many associations other than Ellen D. I would think it was charming and perhaps that it was probably a family name, which it is."

Evelyn nn Ellie

6302,2020-11-09 02:05:48,jqm3pc,"I mean honestly, I think most people‚Äôs first thoughts when they hear Ellen is degeneres. I know a woman named Ellen and people always say ‚Äúoh like Ellen the celebrity!‚Äù Probably won‚Äôt go much farther then that though. 

I don‚Äôt think anyone would think you named your daughter after her. Just the association would be there."
6303,2020-11-09 03:53:56,jqm3pc,"Ellen is my daughter‚Äôs middle name and she is named for my mom, Helen.

I don‚Äôt mind the other spelling actually but it seems very unnecessary. If you love the name though I would either try to convince him or just deal with it (though I get how annoying that would be)"

6326,2020-11-04 16:59:19,jo03ba,Michael might want power but Tommy knows that all of Birmingham respects him like a king. Not to mention the peaky blinders won‚Äôt let Michael run the enterprise.
6327,2020-11-05 01:52:32,jo03ba,"I think the entire point of S6 will be seeing the soldier side of Tommy. We know he has PTSD, but we also know that he‚Äôs worked really well under pressure off the battle field but also on the battlefield. I think we will see him make a sacrifice by working with Moseley. From what I remember, there were many people in Birmingham who were socialist and backed Freddy. I think those same people- some who were loyal to the peaky boys, but maybe not so much after Feddy‚Äôs passing-by S6, would have sympathized with Moseley. There‚Äôs also a divergence with the ushering in of the Women‚Äôs Movement... people might be sour overall. This really touches on the fact that Tommy really has no major allies, which I think is a call back to how he was ‚Äúwaiting for the Calvary to arrive on the battlefield. 

I think he‚Äôs going to go full Romani too. He, like so many other gangster figures, namely Michael Corleone (The God Father), at some point move away from their roots, only to go back. But we all know what happened in 1939. A new world war. Where will this land the Shelbys? Perhaps back in France, where Gypsies roamed, but were persecuted eventually?"

6332,2020-11-05 18:57:53,jo03ba,I hope this is the one season that they don‚Äôt start with a time skip. So much happened in the last five minutes of the season 5 finale and we need to see some more of the aftermath and character reactions after that ending. Then we could skip maybe a couple months after stuff has sort of cooled down

6387,2020-10-25 07:14:27,jhhihj,"Wow, it only took 2 days for Irene to reach HobbyDrama. Great write-up op! I've been following the reaction of Twitter with a kind of horrified fascination and the most bizarre part of this whole debacle to me has been just how far what seems to be quite a number of stans have been going to try to absolve Irene of all guilt. Well, the initial reaction seemed to be ""loll Irene man-hater what a queen"" (the [tweet](https://twitter.com/DobbysCrotch/status/1319286445853474816?s=19) laughing about how ""lol Irene made a man cry I love her!!"" has 4.1k likes), which was already bizarre enough. 

Then there's the claims that the stylist in question had [""messed up""](https://twitter.com/aussiepasta/status/1319261564512456704) the members' outfits and Irene had been electrocuted by her earpiece. Therefore...the victim in question deserved to be put through 20 straight minutes of what must've been awful enough on tape that SM Entertainment immediately issued an official statement because...she needed to be doing her job correctly [and this was a justified expression of dissatisfaction](https://twitter.com/magicveIvet/status/1319281275455193090). Yes. (The stylist in question being for a photoshoot, not a stage performance, which makes this entire thing one huge lie.) But suddenly this is an understandable emotional reaction and haven't you ever felt angry enough to just yell at someone for 20 minutes and make them cry in front of you? Clearly, what we needed Irene's side of the story, because maybe the stylist did something to...warrant this reaction. I wish I could say this was the worst of it, but there have been so many big accounts trying to defame the stylist by claiming she has a poor reputation in the industry, or worse, saying that she's a ""clout-chaser"" who's out to ruin Irene's career. Why not one of these ""woke"" people have realized that they're making all kinds of ""but what was she wearing"" statements and other victim-blaming ilk is a headscratcher.

 Kpop fandom is bad bad obviously, but I've never seen a fandom so shamelessly and systematically gaslight and make up awful, unrelated lies just to try and justify what clearly seems to be a Bad Thing. (The Seungri stans get pretty bad, but usually nobody believes them on any significant level, and it seems like a good amount of casual fans on Twitter have already bought into these false Irene narratives.)"

Like what, broke her wrist skiing or something?

>Due to the alleged lack of common safety measures by the show's crew members in the stage design, in addition to the lift stairs not being in place for the performance, she fell approximately 2.5 metres (8.2 ft). Her injuries included a pelvic fracture, a broken wrist and a cracked cheekbone, all on the right side of her body. The accident and subsequent hospitalisation led to cancellation of all her planned activities. In February 2020, Wendy was discharged from hospital after spending two months recovering, and began outpatient treatment.

Whoa.  How much drama has Wendy's injury caused?  This sounds like a career-ending injury based on how companies tend to treat their idols."

6394,2020-10-24 23:40:15,jhhihj,"Thank you for the write-up, OP! I don‚Äôt run in K-Pop circles in general, but I admit that this post made me want to go check if the one band I do really like (EXID) has had any unfortunate scandals. Instead, I learned they‚Äôre breaking up which is almost as bad :( oh well."
6395,2020-10-24 22:42:11,jhhihj,"Wow, super informative write up. You have a really pleasing writing style!"
6396,2020-10-25 02:39:42,jhhihj,It really pissed me off that it should have been Wendy's comeback then Irene fuck up. She's a grown ass 30 years old and a public figure for that so she should have known better.
6397,2020-10-25 00:50:49,jhhihj,"That's pretty nuts.  Thanks for the writeup, very entertaining."

6399,2020-10-25 04:40:47,jhhihj,"God there's always Kpop drama, thanks for the write-up! I made the mistake of going onto twitter and the number of stans defending her to the death and going ""oh we're not sure what's going on, she might have legitimate reasons for being angry"" as if that excuses verbally abusing someone?? Irene stans be wildin"
6400,2020-10-25 06:41:12,jhhihj,"I don't really familiar with the matter but wow this feels like way out of control? For a behavior like this can lead to ""disbanding"" the group. Feels bad for the other members..."
6401,2020-10-26 02:57:13,jhhihj,Aaaand now SM is debuting a new girl group [aespa](https://old.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/ji39ic/sm_entertainment_to_debut_new_girl_group_aespa/)  Who called it??
6402,2020-10-24 23:11:51,jhhihj,"Of course, stans are defending her because best girl can do no wrong.  They get so vicious and snarky too.  There are also people who work for SM who are defending her and stans are pointing to that as proof she's an angel.  No way, people who work at SM Entertainment are defending one of their biggest money makers?!?!  They graciously, selflessly defending a horror child without expectation of any kind of reimbursement from the powerful company they are currently employees of.  People take their fave too seriously and are blind.  I swear."

Also, great post."
6405,2020-10-25 17:42:39,jhhihj,"No matter the level or nature of a controversy, the K-Pop community is literally incapable of reacting to it appropriately ."
6406,2020-10-25 18:19:20,jhhihj,I‚Äôm a big RV fan so knowing this could be the end sucks.
6407,2020-10-25 21:14:16,jhhihj,This is a great write-up. K-pop drama is always juicy. Cheers
6408,2020-10-29 17:17:26,jhhihj,OP. I am now expecting you to cover the Chanyeol drama.
6409,2020-10-25 10:47:11,jhhihj,Just a quick correction: people defending Seulgi because of the hashtags was also another unfounded fan rumor. Great write-up otherwise!
6410,2020-10-25 07:57:22,jhhihj,"OP, a few corrections:

- No-one defended Seulgi over Irene after Kang Kookhwa‚Äôs post. There was one generic ‚Äòthank you for working hard!‚Äô post made by someone who had worked with Seulgi on something else. That post was not made in response to Kang Kookhwa‚Äôs post. People assumed Irene instead of Seulgi because of her cold attitude and existing rumours which was validated when the editor removed Irene from her post about Monster but not Seulgi.

- She hasn‚Äôt lost her Clinique CFs, but some secondary retailers did pull her ads from their website."
6411,2020-10-25 09:07:02,jhhihj,"Idols, I feel only pity and confusion towards them. Thanks for the write-up, hopefully the situation calms down a bit."
6412,2020-10-25 15:09:51,jhhihj,fantastic write up!!
6413,2020-10-25 23:52:00,jhhihj,"This is like news from an alternate dimension or a science fiction novel or something. I can follow it, but it doesn't seem real."
6414,2020-10-26 13:41:48,jhhihj,"Good write up! I am gonna still be a Red Velvet fan. It sucks that your idols aren‚Äôt who you think they are but this is a good reminder. 

As for Irene...in these cases, people aren‚Äôt all one way or the other (no one is all bad or all good at least at this level), and this isn‚Äôt comparable at all to Burning Molka, even though it‚Äôs getting similar levels of outrage. It kind of seems like misogyny to me. That being said I hope Irene sincerely apologizes to everyone she hurt and that she doesn‚Äôt fucking do it again. 

Her face was all over Seoul still last time I went (about a year ago exactly). I can imagine that kind of fame does bad things to people. However, Irene is an adult (almost 30!) and absolutely should have known better and acted better. 

I guess my point is not to defend her but to point out the discrepancy in reactions in my opinion. Being a diva and a bitch is not a crime, even if it is really unpleasant. I also think the comparisons to AOA‚Äôs Jimin are completely unfounded (being rude to staff v. sustained and inescapable bullying by a group member in a position of power). Other people might think differently and that‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm still gonna support Red Velvet, especially Wendy!"
6415,2020-10-28 23:37:59,jhhihj,I like two Kang's now: Kang Seulgi + Kang Kook Hwa
6416,2020-11-01 21:26:34,jhhihj,wow I wonder how many other kpop idols are ultra megabitches I want all of them to get exposed I live for the drama
6417,2020-11-03 07:27:47,jhhihj,I howled at the title
6418,2020-10-24 23:44:22,jhhihj,"It's sad to me that so many idol fans will become obsessed with minor incidents like this while widespread and systemic abuse is happening in pretty much every K-pop company. Yeah, I'm sure Irene is an asshole, but there are credible reports that most female trainees in SM are anorexic and cut themselves. And I doubt it's just the ladies. And it's definitely not just SM. 

The things I've heard about K-pop company culture are the stuff of nightmares. I get that celebrity gossip is entertaining, of course, I think there's room to care about both. I just find it annoying how predictable the cycle is. Like, everyone cares about decency in the workplace when there's a pretty, popular girl involved. But when it comes to execs telling pre-teens to work 18hr days and starve themselves, that's not nearly as interesting.

Edit: also, great write up! Very thorough. Sorry, I just jumped straight into complaining, lol"

6422,2021-01-19 16:45:44,jhhihj,some have said this was weird (that the stylist came to instagram) because apparently irene had apologized to the stylist in private way before the stylist came to instagram to post.

6424,2020-10-24 22:08:35,jhhihj,I thought we weren't doing ongoing dramas anymore?
6425,2020-10-24 23:29:24,jhhihj,"I lived in Korea before Kpop was popular outside of Asia. I find the growth of kpop fandom utterly perplexing.

Kpop is mediocre bubble gum renditions of R&B music. The singers themselves live a pretty brutal life, the managers are rapists at worst and exploitative monsters at best, there's no plot or ethos or really anything to kpop itself... what is the appeal? Is it really just ogling cute guys and girls? Do kpop fans not know of Asian porn? I get anime fandom, sports fandom, and other kinds of nerd culture, but with kpop there's no there there. 

I just find the whole thing so perplexing.

Edit: instead of just downvoting me can you please try to explain the appeal?"
6426,2020-11-18 14:23:52,jhhihj,Why does the title shows joy tho? Show Irene.

6428,2020-10-25 01:02:57,jhhihj,"As a Kpop fan, I can confirm.

The drama that makes it here are just ""scratching the surface""

Hollywood beefs got nothing on kpop drama."
6429,2020-10-25 05:39:48,jhhihj,K pop drama is why I‚Äôm still subbed here. I‚Äôm not in contact with my old friends who used to give me this kind of third hand fan drama experience and I neeeeeed it
6430,2020-10-24 22:15:58,jhhihj,"Basically, from fan perception, Red Velvet was debuted to cover up issues that f(x) was having (and allegedly to preemptively cover up Jessica leaving SNSD). People also say this led to SM focusing on Red Velvet and neglecting f(x), which is often a thing that happens when a company debuts a new group. Red Velvet debuted in 2014 and f(x) pretty much died off in 2015. Whether it was an intentional strategy or not isn't confirmed but most people believe it."
6431,2020-10-24 23:58:22,jhhihj,OMG I'm still mad about f(x) disbanding.  They were such a dope group with so much talent.
6432,2020-10-24 22:15:00,jhhihj,Red Velvet debuted around when one of f(x)‚Äôs members left. People believe that this was so that their debut could draw attention away from the scandal of the f(x) member leaving. Now people think SM will do something similar and have the new girl group debut to draw attention away from Red Velvet and Irenes scandal
6433,2020-10-24 22:15:20,jhhihj,"K-Pop groups have a pretty short shelf life. A lot of companies will neglect their older groups in favor of their newly-debuted groups, because they know that the older group's members are going to be leaving the company soon (but hmmm....maybe they'd actually want to stay on with the company if they weren't treated like shit? ü§î)"
6434,2020-10-25 07:35:39,jhhihj,"Irene replaced IU as the model for Chamisul soju (the top brand in Korea) in December 2018 and in March 2020 IU replaced her. This was super weird at the time because IU‚Äôs Chamisul sponsorship lasted from December 2014 until December 2018 and Suzy, who has similar It Girl status in Korea - specifically IU is the nation‚Äôs little sister while Suzy is the nation‚Äôs first love - has been the model for Chum Churum, the second most popular brand, since 2016. People expected the same from Irene, who was still really popular at the time.  Her stans claim sales went up while she was the model. So there was really no reason to replace her."
6435,2020-10-25 04:30:17,jhhihj,"I know you've gotten a lot of responses already, but I wanted to add that most major companies have a bad reputation with keeping girl groups active and promoting for very long, and they are especially bad at focusing on more than one girl group at a time. SM has a ton of boy groups, several that have been around for 10+ years, that they promote and give time to, but they rarely have promoted more than one girl group at a time. Girl's Generation was their big group, and they killed that group at their 10 year anniversary because idols were asking to be treated better. f(x) was super popular but had very sporadic releases, and were dropped once Red Velvet debuted. Ever since Red Velvet, SM hasn't promoted or debuted any other girl groups. Female solo artists will get attention, but not groups, while Super Junior (which has members who have committed sexual assault) has been going for nearly 20 years. It's misogyny plain and simple, and is very prevalent in the kpop industry. Girl groups never get the same respect and treatment as boy groups, especially in the big companies, and it's very obvious with SM."
6436,2020-10-25 17:28:08,jhhihj,"I always hear that in Nathan Explosion's voice, and the idea of him commenting on Kpop drama is very funny."
6437,2020-10-25 16:27:28,jhhihj,Well damn. SM is nothing if not consistent. Will edit this into the post in a second.
6438,2020-10-25 16:39:04,jhhihj,On weibo? Is this their female ver of wayv?? A rival to NiziU in JP???
6439,2020-10-25 21:34:47,jhhihj,"Their [weibo account](https://weibo.com/aespa) says they're girls. I do think it's most likely SMNGG since they've been promising their debut this year, and one known SM Rookie left the company recently (meaning the lineup was probably finalized)."
6440,2020-10-24 22:34:44,jhhihj,"Honestly, a lot of people love the ice princess tag. I‚Äôve seen Irene frequently praised for her rbf and there‚Äôs a lot of jokes about Irene hating men because of it. I can‚Äôt say what the Korean fans think of it, but it‚Äôs definitely gained Irene a lot of love in western circles. 

Besides, it‚Äôs not exactly uncommon for idols to have a cold stare, especially during performances. It‚Äôs not really an anti-term."
6441,2020-10-24 22:32:51,jhhihj,"Yes and yes. I've done a Jessica write-up (and a follow-up is on the way soon) but it definitely gets used as like ""look at how cold and mean this person is"" which...I guess wasn't wrong, for Irene, but facial expressions still seem like a shitty basis to judge someone."

6443,2020-10-25 01:14:14,jhhihj,"As a former Sica stan, we foreign fans think of it more as an affectionate nickname."
6444,2020-10-24 22:58:05,jhhihj,"A lot of international stans are spreading just straight lies lol. The stylist being a man for one- the in-ear story is also fake. This incident wasn‚Äôt even at a performance, it was at a photo shoot! There were no in-ears in the first place!"
6445,2020-10-24 23:59:52,jhhihj,"There was a performance in 2016 (yes, 2016) where Yeri (edit: it was Joy, I confused which member it was) was electrocuted and on the 18th of this month, RV did a performance and Irene‚Äôs mic pack fell off her outfit. People have somehow merged these incidences and created an entirely fake story justifying her behavior. Even if that did actually happen, and it was somehow the stylists fault (it wouldn‚Äôt be), the incident the stylist was talking about happened at a photo shoot in the 20th. Twitter stans are literally using moon logic."
6446,2020-10-24 22:43:56,jhhihj,"I saw a lot of people saying it was fine because apparently the stylist is a man??? I‚Äôm not really sure how that justifies it, even if Kang Kook Hwa was a man (she‚Äôs not).

And in Kang‚Äôs second post apparently she stated that Irene didn‚Äôt remember working with her in 2016... so apparently she‚Äôs just jealous Irene doesn‚Äôt remember her and it making it up for clout or something. Smh."
6447,2020-10-25 04:51:59,jhhihj,"The drama itself isn't that wild (celebrity turns out to be a diva, more at 6), but the kpop Twitter response was insane. I consider myself to be fairly numb to the mess that is kpop Twitter, but this was the first time in a while that kpop Twitter genuinely shocked me. Stans were moving like Trump supporters in the way they disregarded actual facts and invented a whole fake narrative to absolve Irene. (At least Trump supporters' lies come from Trump himself -- Irene admitted to the incident and apologized, but her stans are still lying to cover for her.)

Kpop Twitter is usually quick to cancel idols -- just look at how they turned on Jae in the past month -- so I'm baffled that they are defending Irene so hard. I guess this lesbian mean girl persona that they've projected onto Irene is kinda the embodiment of what kpop Twitter wants to be."
6448,2020-10-25 02:45:53,jhhihj,"> electrocuted by her earpiece

The typical Apple ones without the cables, as they have their own power cells and need to be recharged."
6449,2020-11-17 15:36:53,jhhihj,Exactly. If it was false she wouldn‚Äôt have apologized so quickly. I‚Äôve been a RV since the beginning and a joy and Irene fan. I have been saying that for awhile. I knew there was something up with her hatred toward men and rbf look and overall cold attitude. I noticed that attitude back in 2014. And no I‚Äôm not a hater I‚Äôve a long time fan.
6450,2020-10-25 12:26:06,jhhihj,"As someone who's a regular at one of the bigger Kpop forums outside of reddit, I agree. I'm into a lot of things and by extension a part of different communities surrounding them and from my experience, the amount of hypocrisy, strawmanning, and mental gymnastics in the kpop fandom is something else."
6451,2020-10-25 06:58:54,jhhihj,"There is absolutely a double standard when it comes to men and women's public behavior but I think the reason Ellen got spanked so hard over her scandal was because she presented herself as that funny, caring auntie type.  I don't know much about Irene but I'd bet her public persona was the complete opposite of how she acted."
6452,2020-10-25 05:19:46,jhhihj,"Oh yeah, I mean, I‚Äôm not against the term ‚ÄòKaren‚Äô and I think it was originally more specific, but the absolute worst scream-in-my-face-and-threaten-to-have-me-fired public breakdowns I experienced in my customer service years were all from middle aged men."
6453,2020-10-25 00:15:24,jhhihj,"Like once a month for the last 3 years there'll be a post on r/kpop about ""random financial report clearly shows SM planning to debut new GG within next quarter"". And yet...here I am still waiting.

At this point most of the well-known trainees have left, too."
6454,2020-10-25 01:22:56,jhhihj,"according to an ex trainee there aren‚Äôt many prominent female trainees so god knows who they‚Äôre going to debut 

(i‚Äôll guess a young SNSD size group to try and snatch up the Twice fans that don‚Äôt like their newer concepts)"
6455,2020-10-26 01:06:33,jhhihj,"Oh, there was a ton of drama. Fans were furious at SBS, the show where she was injured, and blamed them for negligence. I remember people calling to boycott the show, demanding an apology for Wendy, trending hashtags, etc.

So far, it's still not entirely clear how Wendy's injuries will affect her in the long term. Since the incident, she still hasn't performed any dances yet, just sung. Fortunately, her main asset is her voice (she's regarded as one of the best kpop vocalists of this generation), so she'll still be able to continue to make money by singing. She just might have to take a backseat on performances. And she's famous enough that, though this will hurt her, it's not going to be career-ending.

In a similar case, Heechul from Super Junior (another group from SM Entertainment) fractured his leg at the height of his career, which kept him from performing sometimes. Instead, he focused on appearing on variety shows, which he's known best for now."
6456,2020-11-17 15:37:31,jhhihj,Unfortunately the fame got to her head.

Apparently Ellen is rude asf and has a nasty temper, and her producers aren't much better. But she basically just blamed the producers entirely for the bad work environment and had a bunch of celebrities stick up for her on social media and now shes back to work like nothing happened."
6459,2020-11-17 15:38:55,jhhihj,Ya it does suck. RV is one of my top groups. Just another group that I won‚Äôt have in the future. Especially now since Aespa debuted.

6464,2020-10-25 01:42:41,jhhihj,"This is a good point though.

Taeyong has had bullying scandals and is doing fine. So many members of Super Junior are deeply problematic but they get given variety gigs instead."
6465,2020-11-15 07:15:59,jhhihj,"Jeez...It's not a mere celebrity gossip. The editor is the one who don't have power in this game. Irene emotionally abused a person who worked for her. Maybe it's just an gossip for you but it can be quite sensitive issue in Korea, because as you mentioned working culture in Korea is very hierarchical and you often must endure unfair situations by someone who have more power in the workspace. How are the abuses toward celebs only valuable to consider but the abuse toward steps just ""minor incident""?"
6466,2020-10-24 22:24:52,jhhihj,Nooooooo lmao that's a joke. Her stage name is just Irene. I was making a joke about the similarities to the Ellen thing. My bad.
6467,2020-10-31 20:46:03,jhhihj,Irene's Twitter stans are sick in the head.
6468,2020-10-24 23:41:21,jhhihj,"No. There have been plenty of ""cancellations"" in kpop in the past. 99% of the time the idols bounce back as the public moves on rather quickly. [Park Bom](https://www.koreaboo.com/news/park-bom-speaks-drug-controversy-reveals-everything/) had one of the most infamous scandals of all time and her career didn't die.

However, there have been some people who have been undeniably cancelled. [Jimin of AOA](https://www.soompi.com/article/1410672wpp/former-aoa-member-mina-posts-allegations-detailing-years-of-harassment-from-jimin) is a good, and recent example. As is [Seungri of Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Sun_scandal).

I think this Irene drama is more damaging than most other drama, but I don't know if it's Jimin and Seungri levels of bad. She is very important to SM and I think they will do everything in their power to repair her image."
6469,2020-10-24 23:34:51,jhhihj,"This isn't one misstep. This is cruel and disrespectful behaviour that has apparently persisted over several years. There are plenty of Kpop groups and idols out there whose careers have survived ""one misstep""."
6470,2020-10-24 22:10:55,jhhihj,"I wouldn't consider it ongoing in terms of much more than ""things Irene was going to do are continuing to be cancelled because she's in deep shit"" so maybe my wording wasn't great, but if this breaks the rules then mods can take it down I guess."

Twitter also tends to avoid doing research, so if they can generalize the scandal into one word, they will. That's why you'll hear people call Mamamoo racist, Lucas fatphobic, and Woojin a rapist without actually knowing the full story of what they did. When you try to sum up Irene's scandal, it doesn't sound all *that* bad (""She yelled at a stylist""), even if it's much worse than what other idols have been canceled for."

The other comment brings up the great point that stan Twitter loves to generalize controversies, so I'm explicitly pointing out the Twitter search term each of these controversies turned into. Please understand that I lost braincells looking all of this up again and re-experiencing the fan reactions to these ""controversies"":

* He quote-retweeted a meme of i-mydays beating up k-mydays and told OP to delete the tweet, directing hate from his fans towards OP. It turns out OP was a minor, and this turned into ""Jae bullies a minor"".
* He responded to a comment that said ""JYP sucks"" on his Twitch stream and defended JYP (the person) by bringing up how dominant and influential JYP has been as a singer and a songwriter. He then says something along the lines of, ""You're actually stupid if you think that JYP sucks."" Some fans of JYP groups (especially Got7 fans) thought this was dismissive of fans' complaints about how JYP mismanages their groups. He also got flack for calling his fans stupid. This ended up turning into ""Jae defends a pedophile"".
* In that same stream, he responded to a comment asking where Stray Kids were with, ""How the hell would I know where Stray Kids are?"" Some Stray Kids fans thought this was disrespectful to Stray Kids.
* This was kinda the big one. In response to the last two bullet points, Jae expressed dismay that not everyone understands his sarcasm. A fan pointed out that they're neurodivergent (implying that that's why they don't understand sarcasm). Jae responded by saying he's also neurodivergent because he has anxiety and ADHD. People thought he was being dismissive of the fan, and this quickly turned into ""Jae is ableist"". Jae then tweeted about how how people ""latch onto cancel trains without getting the full story."" When fans asked him to think through that tweet, he dug his heels in deeper and said he was ""pretty set on that last tweet."" A few hours later, he deleted all these tweets and apologized, saying he's educating himself about neurodiversity.
* On a recent stream, a fan asked for encouragement and Jae responded, ""Wherever you are, whatever you do, whoever you do -- oh, I can't go there, I'm Christian."" He was referring to making a sexual innuendo on his stream, but this ended up turning into ""Jae is homophobic"".

Also if you have a power only when you expose what your employer did to you, that's not called power. The editor use this power the public have toward selebs, not her own power."

6529,2020-10-24 23:58:33,jhhihj,"That is objectively and demonstrably incorrect though. Perhaps your girlfriend just likes cute and elegant concepts that lean into the sweet sound?

Saying that kpop is just bubblegum RnB is like saying metal music is just guys screaming about Satan to open chords or that country music is just hillbillies shredding on a banjo. Yes, some artists fit those descriptions, but it's a small and unrepresentative portion of the whole.

What a bizarre take."
6530,2020-10-25 01:00:44,jhhihj,"I spent a good part of my childhood listening to Boyz II Men and Usher and idolizing Brandy and Destiny's Child.

What TWICE hit reminds you of ANY of their discography?

And why the need to get so aggressive over music? I don't understand people who are obsessed with anime or Animal Crossing either but the idea of attacking people over it is plain weird. But you do you I guess..."

* The music videos

* The variety shows (interviews in which they may also play games or do other activities)
* Other content (livestreams, vlogs, etc)

I don't think Kangin's actions should be defended in any way and I think he was allowed to stay a group member for *way* longer than he deserved, but a throwaway line accusing him of sexual assault and linking it to the rest of Super Junior is ridiculous."

But I get why anime fans are obsessive--a lot of anime resonates with feelings of loneliness, alienation, etc. But kpop lacks an ethos or a narrative for people to latch on to.

Imagine a person who was obsessed with shiny Christmas ornaments. Wouldn't that seem weird to you? That's how kpop fans look to normal people."

Some good people, some shitty people, but they're still vivid, complicated people with aspects of humanity in them. That's why all dramas have stories to uncover from multiple perspectives and why people are interested.

The fact that you reduced them to 'shiny christmas ornaments' only serves to tell people that you either objectify them because you lack empathy or you just want to argue in bad faith.

Like he can't handle a rational levelheaded discussion about a freaking music genre so he projected his exposed ass onto me. Lmao.

And I love how when he's losing an argument he accuses you of being a teenager. He thinks he's the only professional on Reddit or something.

6599,2020-10-24 19:11:38,jhei2i,"Being afraid of the blowback from parents over covering LGBTQ+ individuals in class does not make you closed-minded, it makes you appropriately aware of the perception of social issues.

That said, if you are directly covering material from a board-approved textbook, then you individually have nothing to fear. If a parent comes to you with an issue about the topics covered, refer them to your administration immediately with a brief explanation that you were covering approved material. Do not engage beyond that. You should not have to participate in any confrontation that arises over this issue.

I would suggest contacting your school counsellor if you would like advice on responding to questions about LGBTQ+ relationships. Personally, I would not use the phrase ""looks like them"" - a lesbian is a woman who loves another woman, that's all. If they have questions beyond that, ask the counsellor if they have material available for leading a group discussion on LGBTQ+ in general, and clear that with your admin.

Mummies, daddies, love, marriage, babies, and so on are not topics that are inappropriate for first graders if addressed in a grade-appropriate way. You may have kids with gay parents in your class this year, or in the future, and their emotional needs include feeling like their families are represented and valued in their experiences of the world outside their home."
6600,2020-10-24 21:33:20,jhei2i,"I think it‚Äôs annoying to refer to her as ‚Äúlesbian talk show host.‚Äù I can‚Äôt really articulate why. Maybe because it boils a whole nuanced person down into just her sexuality? 

In first grade I‚Äôm all for normalizing all different kinds of people/families. Diverse children‚Äôs literature, a book featuring a family with two moms, people of varying abilities, etc."
6601,2020-10-24 20:16:04,jhei2i,You are going to have students who know what a lesbian is and tell the class. They might not use appropriate terms or give more information than you would have. Just use your district's definition
6602,2020-10-24 22:02:43,jhei2i,"You can keep things really simple with young kids when talking about homosexuality (note: don't use the word homosexuality;) because they will just accept the facts that you tell them. You can even oversimplify a little and just say ""she is married to another woman"". And that's it. You're on to the next thing."
6603,2020-10-24 21:15:09,jhei2i,"Not a popular opinion but I don't see how sexual preference has anything to do with the unit or lesson at hand, especially for 1st grade.

If the content is about equality or LGBTQ then yeah, it should be noted, but if it isn't about those subjects than why bring it up? I get that is a part of an identity, it just doesn't seem relevant for the audience."
6604,2020-10-25 01:12:58,jhei2i,"I said her prompt, meaning the initial piece she is talking about.

It has been at least half a day since I quickly read it.

Also, it isn‚Äôt like everyone uses the exact same curriculum. Even people on the same program focus on different content.

It has 100% affected how I plan my lessons. I find myself shying away from topics that, regardless of the mental gymnastics needed to misconstrue them, could make my life miserable again. I cover the standards and check the boxes. That‚Äôs it. 

I‚Äôm looking for a way out. I‚Äôm done with teaching, but I‚Äôm also a single parent. I have to make sure my bases are covered before I jump ship. I will be jumping ship, though."
6606,2020-10-25 08:36:22,jhei2i,"I‚Äôd skip it, since most of them can‚Äôt read the word, and if they ask I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs says lovely or some other word that begins with L! That is not a can of worms I‚Äôm willing to open."
6607,2020-10-25 12:45:53,jhei2i,Yeah. I don‚Äôt think you were relieved to not have to teach it because you did not think it was appropriate for first grade but because it did not cover the material fully and left a lot up to you. I think lessons about different types of families are important and that is where that should be taught. Imagine if we referee to every straight person as such. ‚ÄúRachel Ray is a straight talk show host who...‚Äù

This is a solid point. It is an awkward way to phrase it from an adult's perspective.

On the other hand, we boil a whole lot of nuance down for first graders anyway, and Ellen being gay is a significant part of her work and public life."
6610,2020-10-25 00:51:08,jhei2i,"I have never read, ""Heterosexual president Abraham Lincoln"" or the like...

I like to think about as someone's sex life is not anything I am teaching first graders, no matter what it might be. If the only thing there is to know about them is who they are sleeping with, it's not important to kids. I don't hide families with same-sex parents, as that is relevant to kids."
6611,2020-10-24 22:41:30,jhei2i,"Well, some 2nd graders have a gay teacher and when that gay teachers spouse comes in to help with the class, it clarifies things. I also have had 4 kids in the past 2 years with same sex parents, and I teach 2nd grade. LGBTQ people have stopped hiding in the closet, and because its our sexuality that makes us targets, it has a lot to do with what needs to be taught. Its very relevant."
6612,2020-10-24 22:29:37,jhei2i,"I don't recall the OP sharing the details of the unit or lesson, so I'm not sure how you came to that conclusion.

We mention heterosexual relationships all the time when their inclusion is not necessary for the unit or lesson at hand, generally because relating topics to student experience is considered good practice. Homosexual relationships are the same way, and should be treated as such."
6613,2020-10-25 01:05:32,jhei2i,"We do have words that don't refer to sexuality for these examples, too. ""Heteroromantic"" would be the one that applies to a man who loves a woman.

I think it is necessary to cover the words ""gay"" and ""lesbian"" early, if for no other reason than to reinforce their use as words with meanings beyond the pejorative."
6614,2020-10-24 22:44:30,jhei2i,"Couldn't agree more! It needs to be taught and is relevant.

This specific content wasn't. She was literally just skimming articles."
6615,2020-10-24 22:36:58,jhei2i,My justification is that it is 1st grade and I‚Äôve taught it...
6616,2020-10-24 22:59:03,jhei2i,"You mean you've taught the same curriculum using the same textbook? That's handy; what *was* the context of the biographical excerpt about Ellen?

Do you not have any thoughts about the other part of my comment?"
6617,2020-10-24 23:32:29,jhei2i,"Yep.

It isn‚Äôt relevant if it doesn‚Äôt do anything for the story.

Tina Fey, a heterosexual female, help save a group of kids from a burning bus.

Please tell me how this isn‚Äôt insane?"
6618,2020-10-24 23:41:49,jhei2i,"Ok, I mean that's a great example of *reductio ad absurdum*, but doesn't actually respond to anything I've said.

Gay people don't exclusively belong inside of LBGTQ+-focused lesson content, and neither do mentions of homosexuality. Ellen is gay, and it is not an insignificant part of her work and public life (as I said elsewhere in the thread).

I agree that the specific phrasing in this example is clunky and awkward, but that's a criticism of the writing, not the inclusion of an LGBTQ+ figure in a context unrelated to their sexuality. If, for example, the excerpt had begun with ""Ellen, a talk show host and comedienne, married her wife, Portia de Rossi, in 2008."", how would that affect your perspective?"
6619,2020-10-25 00:02:26,jhei2i,Absolutely not. In that case it is relevant to the person and the specific situation. Under the assumption it is about Ellen. I didn't get that sense from her prompt but I don't even remember it at this point.
6620,2020-10-25 00:13:27,jhei2i,"> I didn't get that sense from her prompt but I don't even remember it at this point.

What? This discussion *began* with you declaring that you were qualified to talk about it because you had taught the same curriculum using the same textbook. But you can't remember the context?

Come on."

I have a question, what will the funding be spent on specifically?"
6623,2020-10-24 14:00:27,jh6zpp,"I worked with a crowdfunding campaign that was trying to help their live music magazine website. Obviously they were hit hard from COVID so they sold a bunch of stuff like t shirts and other things related to their site. 

If you are looking to do something to help your site then I would do something like that. Just make sure you can actually sell them something related to your site so you can use your existing community.

Edit - forget to mention, Kickstarter would be good for that"

6639,2020-12-15 14:05:10,kdlo7s,If have to say the tubers simply due to being younger than the hosts I mean almost all the hosts are above fifty and with one of them looking like they‚Äôre about to die any second it‚Äôs kind obvious they would lose
6640,2020-12-15 14:06:58,kdlo7s,"Not familiar, but isn't Vlad and Niki literal chicldren, and there is 2 of them?"
6641,2020-12-15 14:07:25,kdlo7s,"Idk much about the youtubers but I would guess they win.

Although Steve Harvey and Dr. Phil are pretty big, the TV hosts are quite old. I mean judge judy is like 80!

Age is a huge factor and I would imagine 1-2 good hits would put down the older folks pretty easy. Not to mention that they have been pampered a good portion of their lives and I doubt are used to taking punches let alone any physical pain.


Edit: holy crap just looked up the youtubers lol there are legit kids. 

Ok if the adult youtubers blitz Steve Harvey and Jimmy Fallon then I can see them winning. Essentially this is a battle of 3 average adult men against 3 golden age humans + a middle aged man.

If I have to go by my nephews' strengths then I would say the kids have almost 0 chance of hurting anyone. Unless they all were to climb on judge judy together and knock her to the ground. Or somehow get a hit in one of the guys' family jewels."
6642,2020-12-15 15:02:51,kdlo7s,"I like how so many Redditors assume Mr. Beast's ""wealth"" is going to tilt it in favor of the Youtuber's. While a net worth of 8 million is a lot, Judge Judge has $440 *million* , and Ellen made $82 million last year. The TV stars have hundreds of people working for and under them and a life time of connections to tap.


Drop them into the Hunger Games then the streamers win, sure. 
Give them 1 hour prep? The TV starts make a couple phone calls and spend the rest of the time in make up so they look good for the victory pics."
6643,2020-12-15 14:33:32,kdlo7s,"I don't know who any of the YouTubers are, but... do we actually live in a world where Judge Judy is a ""top 5"" TV show host, or are you making that list up off the top of your head?

Sincere question."
6644,2020-12-15 13:51:25,kdlo7s,"YouTubers, mbreast just buys a nuke"
6645,2020-12-15 14:40:24,kdlo7s,"***Scenario***

Mr Beast: *This video I bought a private island,A Battle bus,the top 5 YouTubers and top 5 Tv hosts,to fight to the death in a 5v5 real life battle royal.*

*The winner team gets to keep the island and the prize money of half a million dollars*

*A thanks to honey for being today sponsoring, it‚Äôs a free google chrome extension an with just a few clicks helps you save money by looking for coupons across the web and applying them to items you‚Äôre going to purchase.*

Probably team youtube, There more younger an fit team even with the two literal children they could still probably take on the elderly"
6646,2020-12-15 14:46:55,kdlo7s,"The top youtubers have changed, I don't recognize any of those names except pewds."
6647,2020-12-15 14:49:49,kdlo7s,"Three of the Youtubers are children so that might put them at a disadvantage. However the TV hosts are quite old, Steve Harvey is 63, Judy is 78 and Dr. Phil is 70. The easiest to take out is Judy, she is 78 and only 5 foot 1. I think the 3 children could handle her which leaves the other 4 hosts. Fallon is the biggest threat left because he is the youngest and presumably the healthiest. Phil and Harvey are both old but they look pretty large. This basically leaves us with 3 young YouTubers against two older men, one 46-year-old man, and a 62-year-old woman.

I think if the children survive taking down Judy and manage to bite some ankles that gives the Youtubers a much better chance. I think Pewdiepie could take on two of the older people together and MrBeast and Juega German could clean up Ellen and Fallon as they look to be in decent shape and are both at least 6 foot. I think YouTubers win 7/10 if the children don't get destroyed immediately."
6648,2020-12-15 14:17:34,kdlo7s,"Conan is a bigger celebrity and bigger threat than all 5 of these hosts you‚Äôve mentioned, Michael strehan is also a tv host now, both of which would dramatically swing the combat for tv"
6649,2020-12-15 14:48:40,kdlo7s,"Most of the YouTubers are in good shape compared to the TV hosts, which are in their 40s -60s. PewDiePie in particular is pretty fit."
6650,2020-12-15 15:04:10,kdlo7s,"Judge Judy solos.

On a real though, the YouTubers are at a massive advantage due to age. However if you replace one of the hosts with Conan, I genuinely believe he can take them all."
6651,2020-12-15 15:20:08,kdlo7s,"Now that the hosts lost Trebek, it‚Äôs over for them."
6652,2020-12-15 15:55:08,kdlo7s,Everybody wins because Dr. Phil is getting his ass whupped.
6653,2020-12-15 16:23:17,kdlo7s,Have you seen Pewdiepie? He could solo every host
6654,2020-12-15 16:42:52,kdlo7s,"Would be interesting to see a battle of influence between these.

Like:

Win condition: destroy the other group reputation to the point where they can't make money out of it

Round 1: only by using professional means (tv show, youtube channel)

Round 2: only using legal means

Round 3: no rules"
6655,2020-12-15 13:54:20,kdlo7s,How do you not have Alex Trebek on this list? Shameful
6656,2020-12-15 14:37:55,kdlo7s,"The youtubers win, Pewds is buff and could beat the shit out of them all and mrbeast could just buy a gun if the match has them even if the hosts had guns there old and probably couldn't aim them well"
6657,2020-12-15 15:52:39,kdlo7s,There‚Äôs people on both lists that I‚Äôve never heard of  before.
6658,2020-12-15 18:00:54,kdlo7s,i would give it to the YouTubers for being younger and healthier. the only hosts i see standing a chance are Fallon and Harvey but even then i would still reckon they lose. the kid youtubers wont be of help and i doubt the celebrities are gonna want to hurt them but the adult youtubers should take it.
6659,2020-12-15 19:16:32,kdlo7s,It's 6v5 so I'd go with the YouTubers

6666,2020-12-15 20:10:59,kdlo7s,"I would say YouTube just for Pewds and Beast, but with Dr. Phil and Steve Harvey, I gotta say it's probably a tie. Biggest downside for TV, though, is Ellen."
6667,2020-12-15 20:28:53,kdlo7s,"2 of the YouTubers are kids so they would get killed. Judy is the easy kill for the TV hosts and Ellen is next. It‚Äôs now Fallon, Dr.Phil, and Harvey vs Pewdiepie, MrBeast and German. MrBeast would beat Dr.Phil quick, and Pewdiepie can beat Fallon. I don‚Äôt really know what would happen with Steve and German but Dr.Phil would be out quick, so it would be Harvey vs German and MrBeast. YouTubers win."
6668,2020-12-15 21:00:52,kdlo7s,"I would try to give an answer but I have no idea who any of those Youtubers are besides Pewdiepie. Are they really the top creators on the platform? 

I pretty sure Pewdiepie would fall really easily to even Judge Judy. Not sure about the rest."

6675,2020-12-16 02:30:02,kdlo7s,"This is a battle between Pewdiepie, Juega and Mr Beast vs Jimmy Fallon, Dr Phil and Steve Harvey. 

While I think that Dr phil and steve harvey may be strong may I remind you that they‚Äôre also old. One of the kids could easily outpace them. Then once there exhausted they‚Äôre dead. So its Jimmy Fallon vs Pewdiepie and Mrbeast. They both workout and Beast is 23. Lets just say that Mrbeast is donating 100k to Jimmy Fallons funeral. That leaves Ellen Degeneres and Judge Judy. They‚Äôre pretty weak physically. Hell pretty sure the kids could take on Judge Judy. German can take on ellen no problem however."

Ellen gets a quick KO with whoever she squares up with after faking a friendly hand shake and chucking a left hook.

6686,2020-12-15 14:14:12,kdlo7s,"I think the fight is balanced by the youtubers having 3 children on their side. Any of the 5 hosts, including Judy, can defeat juvenile children."

6690,2020-12-16 04:59:21,kdlo7s,"Exactly, the amount of money that youtubers have compared to real celebs is laughable. Celebs destroy youtubers."

6754,2020-12-15 18:26:46,kdlo7s,"That's a bit misleading, it's not so much that pro athletes are at their best in their early 20s, they just haven't had a change to be injured yet."
6755,2020-12-16 00:46:00,kdlo7s,"Your peak in terms flexibility and athletic ability are in your early to mid twenties. Your peak ""strength"" is actually in your mid 30s. The ideal age range for peak Power Lifters is 35 +/-7 years.

The average age of all male UFC fighters is 31. The peak age for a pro boxer is between 28-35.

Generally speaking a young 30 year old should dominate a young 20 year old of similar size/skill."
6756,2020-12-15 17:11:05,kdlo7s,"Pro athletes are obviously much different than the average 22 year old. 

I would destroy 22 year old me. I worked out more back then, but I have 30 pounds on that punk. Also I would have much more confidence. 

All other things being equal, I'll take the 50/60 year old man over the 22 year old kid in a fight. 

That said, all other things aren't equal. I don't know if Harvey is in good enough shape and I don't know if Beast has ever been in a fight."
6757,2020-12-15 23:44:37,kdlo7s,"Humans tend to hit our peak strength late 20s. Many professional athletes are in the early 20s because their bodies aren't as fresh and is way less damaged. But if you look at whoever is the best right now they will most likely be 27-29 years old outside of some freakisly talented young talent. 

But since none of them are currently top tier athletes it doesn't matter for this WWW."

6760,2020-12-16 02:04:07,kdlo7s,"I think a good example of this is professional sports, in the NBA guys are typically still improving from 20-25, 26-30 is the general ‚Äúpeak‚Äù, and after that point the accumulated physical stress starts wearing them down and they don‚Äôt recover as well, even if they‚Äôre still capable of reaching the same peaks in their thirties, it just isn‚Äôt as consistent, and everyone is out of the league by 40."
6761,2020-12-15 17:23:03,kdlo7s,I guess it really depends on the person.  A big 60 year old could beat a skinny 22 year old.  But a fit 20 year old could beat an out of shape or small/ not muscular 60 year old.
6762,2020-12-15 21:23:35,kdlo7s,"> I would destroy 22 year old me.

That might be true for you, but I imagine most people it would be the opposite.  I'm 28 and 30lbs heavier than I was at 22, with less endurance because I'm used to sitting at a desk all day, not walking around a college campus to get to classes.  22 year old me would absolutely destroy current me."

6767,2020-12-15 17:25:34,kdlo7s,"Agreed. 

Harvey seems like a solid guy who could do a decent job handling himself. I've never seen Beast but I've heard his voice when my kids watch him. He sounds small :-) 

Though he's probably a little bit of a character to his younger audience"
6768,2020-12-16 02:40:42,kdlo7s,"He looks better than the average person,but he's nowhere near jacked"
6769,2020-12-16 01:48:38,kdlo7s,People see the smallest amount of muscle on someone and say things like ‚Äòhes jacked‚Äô or ‚Äòhes yolked‚Äô.

6771,2020-12-19 06:14:03,kdlo7s,"Yeah, I'm 28 and my dad is 63. I have like 3.5 inches of height on him, probably less than 10 pounds difference between us. We're both fairly strong/athletic and similar pain tolerances (although he has had more opportunities to experience that tolerance than I have so far) 

I think my only shot at winning an all out fight would be exploiting one of his existing injuries/weak spots. He is definitely still stronger than I am, I remember once instance trying to move a large chunk of granite with a pry bar. I was able to move it but had to do so in very small increments, he came by and grunted it the rest of the way in one motion."
6772,2020-12-15 18:16:20,kdlo7s,"Hmm, idk about that, after a cursory google search he's 6'3"" in shape and comes from a rural Kansas upbringing so I'd bet on him just on a youth and height advantage alone. Wouldn't be shocked if he knew how to scrap at least a little."

I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs jacked"
6774,2020-12-15 18:42:24,kdlo7s,"Ok, this is fun! I hit google myself...

Harvey is 6'2"" so not much of a height advantage for Mr. Beast

Harvey is from Ohio (born in WV) so I'm willing to bet he has a bit of experience in fisticuffs himself

Now for the biggie!

MensJournal featured Harvey a while back for his outstanding fitness regiment! He's been working out with an 8 time Mr. Olympia and trimmed himself down to 215 (that was his goal - I'm not sure if he hit it). His IG shows him doing burpees (with a sandbag), weight training, sumo squats, and battle ropes. 

Harvey isn't an average 60 y/o. Without knowing for sure which has more actual fight experience, my money is confidently on Harvey."
6775,2020-12-16 02:50:55,kdlo7s,Idk man I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs in great shape. Like i‚Äôd consider jacked to be decent size and definition. Pewds is simply too skinny in my opinion. Search jacked on google and the results are way over what pewds has.
6776,2020-12-15 18:48:56,kdlo7s,"hmmm, according to google steve harvey is 6'1"" not 6'2"" but yea seems like with his physical aptitude and live experience he's have the definite edge. Though I'd still expect it to be a pretty decent fight."
6777,2020-12-16 03:13:22,kdlo7s,"I agree with you. Not gatekeeping ""jacked"" but you have to be *BIG* to be jacked. Pewdiepie is still kinda standard sized"
6778,2020-12-15 19:03:37,kdlo7s,"Yea, I just googled and he's apparently somewhere between 5'1"" and 8'. Let's go with 6'1"" though. 

Agreed. It comes down to 40 years vs 40 (or so) lbs. and whoever has the experience. If Beast has been in a scrap or two and knows how to handle himself he could take Harvey down. If it turns into the average grab and hit the floor fight I think it favors Harvey."
6779,2020-12-16 08:01:14,kdlo7s,"Yeah, he is in very good shape, but he ain't jacked. 

I'd say it isn't gatekeeping, cause if you include everyone in every single adjective, the words will just lose all meaning."

* Padding Crew

Though most likely, the closest thing we‚Äôll get to an iconic selfie will be from the upcoming SM and BH Labels concerts.

6967,2020-12-27 15:17:55,kl4qk9,"This is 100% a false statement. Ellen didn't inspire shit. We already know the Masked Singer is based on a Korean reality show with the same name. In the Korean shows, the contestants sing and dance.

https://youtu.be/OnksOyWbHzY

So all Ellen really did was chop a show in half and sold it as two separate shows."
6968,2020-12-27 15:23:42,kl4qk9,A positive article about Ellen DeGeneres? That's brave.

6970,2020-12-27 15:53:24,kl4qk9,She harassed and abused this into fruition! Go Ellen
6971,2020-12-27 16:34:41,kl4qk9,"You're missing a few things.

First, Ellen DeGeneres has nothing to do with The Masked Singer. The idea that she ""chop[ped] a show in half and sold it as two separate shows"" is laughable because she doesn't have any credits on The Masked Singer.

The producers of The Masked Singer are Craig Plestis, Izzie Pick Ibarra, Rosie Seitchik, Nick Cannon, and James Breen. It was their decision (along with some Fox executives) to not have the American Masked Singer also do dances.

Then, you're missing that Ellen did just The Masked Dancer bit on her own show about a year ago. This proved that American audiences were also interested in the dancing portion of the idea. What works in the original Korean version of the show isn't guaranteed to work for American audiences. 

It's clear she did play some part in this new show. I'm not defending Ellen as a person, but if you're going to talk shit at least be accurate."
6972,2020-12-27 19:40:22,kl4qk9,"Thanks for this info. Even if Ellen is a total piece of garbage, I prefer to know the truth from someone that knows what they‚Äôre talking about rather than OP‚Äôs misinformation"

6974,2020-12-27 16:50:06,kl4qk9,"That...or maybe I simply read the article posted (where I got the bit about Ellen doing the masked dancer on her own show) and I googled ""masked singer producers"". From there it isn't using a lot of brain power to type out the comment I made."
6975,2020-12-27 16:54:50,kl4qk9,"You mean the PR puff peice that pretends fox had no clue people could dance in mask till Ellen taught them?

7008,2020-12-26 10:00:09,kkful6,"As a queer, I am grateful that Ellen helped normalise discussions about being LGBT+. As an Arab, fuck her for befriending a war criminal that screwed over my region, lolz."
7009,2020-12-26 09:28:58,kkful6,"How about we stop calling it cancel culture and start calling it consequences for actions? No one is owed immunity from doing shitty things. Other people doing shitty things doesn‚Äôt absolve anyone of the shitty things they do and doing good things in the past doesn‚Äôt erase the shitty things.

Ellen being a prick doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt enjoy her show but you don‚Äôt get to police the people accurately calling her out for her damaging behaviour."
7010,2020-12-26 09:34:10,kkful6,"Just like you can have your own opinion and like Ellen, others can choose not to like/support her. 

Cancel culture is another way of saying boycott. No one is actually cancelling culture, but instead putting their money/support with those that don‚Äôt do things like Ellen has. If we stay satisfied with the status quo rather than reach for progress, we will never continue to accept new ideas and ways for caring for your fellow human. 

Yes, Ellen has done of good for the LGBT community, but just cause someone does good does not give them a pass to be an asshole"
7011,2020-12-26 10:42:15,kkful6,"I would take more interest in the wider implications of cancel culture, if it actually did much of anything beyond give the people being ""canceled"" an excuse to make the talk show circuit where they can rant about how they're being silenced. This will all blow over in a couple weeks, and nothing substantial will have changed. Ellen DeGeneres is rich and powerful. Even if her show is canceled outright, which is exceedingly unlikely if historical president holds true, she will land on her feet and probably have a new show within the year."
7012,2020-12-26 09:39:42,kkful6,"Here's the thing about Ellen. Her behavior behind the scenes has been reported by multiple people who were hurt by it. If there is no backlash, it means that we're all fine with mighty Ellen abusing the ""little"" people who work for her. It means we don't mind icons creating hostile work conditions for their employees. It means the rich can do whatever they want to others.

This is not a good stance to take, regardless of who you want to avoid ""cancelling"" (which is a nebulous notion at the best of times, but just watch Ellen come back with a different show on a different network if her current is indeed cancelled; she is at a point in her career where she's too rich to actually need to work, and too big to not find work if she wants to). Yes, Ellen is a gay icon, responsible for some major cultural moments in LGBTQ history; but she's also a rich asshole. So for now, it's backlash o'clock."

7015,2020-12-26 12:03:09,kkful6,"But as a part of the legal community, my role, my ethics, tell me not to see an action as black or white. All acts are grey and have motives. So you punish the motive more than the act (exceptions are made for felonies like murder) it‚Äôs much better than assuming guilt. Remember, you are presumed innocent before being PROVEN guilty (by COURT)."
7016,2020-12-26 12:01:05,kkful6,"Regardless, who are we to judge. Aren‚Äôt we all human? We all screw up at one point in life. I think forgiveness and acceptance are better on our souls than hatred."
7017,2020-12-26 11:59:32,kkful6,"But look, the way I‚Äôve been brought up,  unless you‚Äôre a judge, you are not entitled to condemn people. Ellen and Rowling are humans. They make mistakes. Only two entities in my opinion can judge. Judges and God."

7021,2020-12-26 15:32:26,kkful6,"You complain about cancel culture and how it‚Äôs not up to us to judge, but here you are doing the same with JK Rowling: https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/izfzu3/jk_rowling_can_get_lost/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Like we all said, everyone is entitled to their opinion. And when people are shitty we can also decide to hold them accountable for their actions and not support them."
7022,2020-12-26 12:16:50,kkful6,"Your entitled to that opinion, I guess. Can't say I understand the impulse. I prescribe to the contractarian school of moral philosophy, myself. If we don't take people to task for their mistakes, they will feel like it was not a mistake as there was no personal consequence, and others will see that there is none and follow suit if it pleases them. It is true that we can't punish them in law, as that is the job of others in our society, but the court of public opinion is ours to wield. But, again, it doesn't really matter, because in our society money gives a great advantage in that space, so she'll be fine, weather she deserves it or not."
7023,2020-12-26 12:48:25,kkful6,"I would also like to add that you're allowed to not like someone, even if you admire some stuff about them, and you're also allowed to change your mind if they apologize. You don't owe them your affection. 

I don't really know that much about Ellen DeGeneres. I don't really like her style so don't watch her stuff, and haven't heard much of anything about whatever is going on to cause the controversy. I do know about Rowling, however. I liked her stuff well enough, but can't support someone who actively and deliberately works to curtail the trans community. That is a personal decision, but a fairly common one. I just can't properly put an author to death when it is the accrued wealth and acclaim I and people like me give them by buying and enjoying their work that gives them the power to do great harm. If I let myself become blind to the wrongdoings of others merely to allow myself greater pleasure, it is I who would ultimately be judged wanting."
7024,2020-12-26 13:41:19,kkful6,">But look, the way I‚Äôve been brought up, unless you‚Äôre a judge, you are not entitled to condemn people

Are you not doing the same to people who ""cancelled"" Ellen?"
7025,2020-12-26 12:13:28,kkful6,"Legal sanctions aren't the only kind of consequences. If someone does or says something awful, it is everyone's right to shun them for it."
7026,2020-12-26 13:53:45,kkful6,So in a hypothetical scenario where somebody around you got bullied or worse you would wait for a Court appointed judge and/or God to tell you if you should treat the one bullying any differently or not?
7027,2020-12-26 15:13:14,kkful6,"No, I get their opinion but don‚Äôt promote it"
7028,2020-12-26 15:12:12,kkful6,Bullying is a crime and is dealt firmly by schools who get BOTH sides before sanctioning.
7029,2020-12-26 17:07:32,kkful6,"Eh they're saying Ellen shouldn't do certain things, you're saying nobodies on Twitter shouldn't do certain things. Only difference I see is that Ellen actually has an audience and can influence people and the things she's done have actually been pretty harmful to people."
7030,2020-12-26 21:04:50,kkful6,"I'm actually a bit hurt that you responded to this person, and not me. I'm unduly proud of the prose at the end of my last comment."

7045,2020-12-21 16:38:47,khkpen,"If you're deeply used to seeing relationships in terms of man-and-woman, you will tend to be predisposed to see that pattern in other relationships. If you hear someone mention the word heteronormativity, this is what they mean by that. 

In a relationship between two men, surely there will be some way that you could categorize one of them as being more feminine than the other. 

In a relationship between two women, surely there will be some way that you could categorize one of them as being more masculine than the other. 

The people in those relationships may or may not agree with your characterization of such things."
7046,2020-12-21 16:39:19,khkpen,"Once you don't need to find a partner in a typical straight social environment, you have a lot more freedom to wear what you want. Because of that, some gay people like to wear things that are often worn by people of a different gender, like men wearing makeup or women wearing men's suits.

Sometimes, one woman who likes to wear suits falls in love with another woman who likes to wear suits, and sometimes she falls in love with a woman who likes to wear dresses. Like with straight people, some people have a type and prefer partners with a specific look, and other people don't. There are lots of gay couples where both people dress similarly, and others where they dress differently. 

It doesn't particularly go along with ""masculine"" or ""feminine"" roles. For example, the person who dresses more feminine is sometimes the one who is better at fixing stuff in the house, and the one who dresses more masculine is sometimes better at cooking. It just depends on the person. 

And for your last question... are straight men attracted to men who wear makeup and have long hair? No they are not, because they are attracted to women, not to makeup and long hair. It is exactly the same with gay men: they still like men, even if the men are wearing things that women sometimes wear."
7047,2020-12-21 16:38:18,khkpen,"Some couples are like that, and some aren't. The ratio is not as skewed as your question assumes.

> If you‚Äôre attracted to a masculine woman, why aren‚Äôt you attracted to a man?

One answer to this I've heard is something like, ""Because I'm not attracted to male genitals."""

7050,2020-12-21 16:55:06,khkpen,"I've been myself in homosexual relationships and know many same sex couples of both sexes. It's not ""typical"", actually I think it's false more often than it is true, at least based on my own and my friends' experience. I mean yeah, there are couples where there's one feminine guy and one masculine guy, usually the feminine one is the ""bottom"" and the masculine one is the ""top"" (of course that's not written in stone), and same goes for female couples. But there are just as many couples, if not more, where both parts are either masculine or feminine. It's just harder to notice them, because they don't look like couples unless they explicitly tell you.

As for why bottom gays are often more camp/feminine than top gays, I guess it's just a mystery of biology.

>I mean no offense by this question and I apologize deeply if it comes across as insensitive in any way, I‚Äôm just genuinely curious! I also apologize if I‚Äôm not using the proper terms

I am better at doing traditionally masculine things like opening jars or whatever.
My wife is better at housework outside.
We are so switch. One of us is not more masculine or feminine in our relationship. It‚Äôs a pretty equal distribution.
I have very short hair and my wife typically wears hers in a braid.
What I‚Äôm trying to say here is that there are so many facets of a person that it‚Äôs very hard to categorize them. Also, gender roles change over time and what is seen as masculine now may be completely different in the future."
7054,2020-12-21 21:01:25,khkpen,Genuinely just a stereotype. Gay men don‚Äôt act like women and gay women DEFINITELY don‚Äôt act like men lol
7055,2020-12-21 16:46:20,khkpen,"You‚Äôre thinking about it from a rather rigid, straight person perspective. First, couples don‚Äôt usually have the roles you mention. Second, queer folks are most definitely not attempting to emulate straight couples. 

If you really want to understand (and aren‚Äôt just trolling), try to put yourself in a queer person‚Äôs mindset. 

If a queer person were to ask your question about straight people, how would it go? Maybe like, ‚ÄúWhy do straight people conform so rigidly to one set of gender roles? Why do they suppress their sexuality if it ever deviates from heteronormative expectations? Why can‚Äôt they just take an ‚Äòanything goes‚Äô attitude toward life and do what makes them happy?‚Äù

Lots of weird assumptions in that. But... they mirror the ones in your question. Work backward, and maybe you‚Äôll find the happy medium which helps you understand."
7056,2020-12-21 16:36:38,khkpen,"This is totally false. Plenty of same sex couples have partners that don't fit in to either ""role"". Sure someone might have more nurturing personality than the other, or one person more handy or something but I think you're just generalizing based on limited experience."
7057,2020-12-21 16:44:29,khkpen,That's not at all how it works. That's just how straight people look at it because that's what their whole deal is. It's completely false.

7062,2020-12-21 17:24:27,khkpen,"It's ok to not want to sound disrespectful, but also don't be overly apologetic lol

I personally find kind of annoying when people constantly apologize to me whenever they want to ask me a question about gay stuff. Like, we're not made of crystal, just ask the damn question. We want to be treated like the regular ass folks that we are, not like some sort of endangered super-sensitive species that will die if you upset it too much. This is not directed to you specifically, it's just a rant."
7063,2020-12-21 16:58:20,khkpen,"Your question wasn‚Äôt offensive ‚Äî I was just trying to offer a construct for understanding. If a queer person made similar assumptions, that‚Äôs how it would sound. 

The reality is, it takes all kinds. It‚Äôs no more complicated than that. Traditional straight couples are a bit of a myth, too ‚Äî it‚Äôs not like the ‚Äúman always wears the pants‚Äù in the family.

But yeah, try to get to know some queer people. It‚Äôll make sense. üôÇ"
