2,2020-02-05 12:32:01,ez8u2h,"""The Gay Guy Of The Group"" even tho I'm straight  and when I'm introduced as that I tend to be the last person they want to talk to which is shit cuz I'm always up to making new friends"
3,2020-02-05 12:38:14,ez8u2h,Wait for it
4,2020-02-05 12:35:58,ez8u2h,The disappointment
5,2020-02-05 14:58:04,ez8u2h,Nice

8,2020-02-05 14:39:57,ez8r4e,"The Rock isn’t 6’5”. That was his “listed” height in the WWE. I don’t think he’s as short as some people are proposing (6’1” seems too short). I would put him at 6’2” 1/2, 6’3” at most. But at 265-270 lbs and 10-11% bf, he’s a monster at any height."
9,2020-02-05 13:35:51,ez8r4e,When was Dwayne 6'5? Thought he was 6'3?
10,2020-02-05 15:53:24,ez8r4e,"The Rock used to be 6'5"", but he's eroding."
11,2020-02-05 13:15:41,ez8r4e,I can't believe Garappolo would lie about being shorter than he actually is.
12,2020-02-05 17:02:37,ez8r4e,"Watch The Rundown, says Dwayne is 6'2"" in like the first 5 minutes of the movie. Lol"
13,2020-02-05 15:32:33,ez8r4e,Wow this actually blows my mind! I've pictured The Rock as 6'5 ever since I was a kid. No doubt he still seems intimidating and larger than life to see irl
14,2020-02-05 16:58:38,ez8r4e,[deleted]
15,2020-02-05 15:48:11,ez8r4e,It’s been well known he lies about his height for a long time. Defo not 6’5 not even 6’4. At a push he might be 6’3.
16,2020-02-05 13:31:00,ez8r4e,"To be fair, one of them is probably in cleats."
17,2020-02-05 20:45:39,ez8r4e,"I've seen so many people here bash celebheights for caring too much about exact height and yet here we are with every other person claiming ""i thought he was 6'5!"" 

It's pretty common among height enthusiasts how tall he is, and all y'all claiming he's 6'3.5 because you're 6'4 and you met him? Sorry but y'all aint 6'4"
18,2020-02-05 21:18:24,ez8r4e,Garappolo in heels
19,2020-02-05 20:35:24,ez8r4e,Dwayne The Pebble Johnson
20,2020-02-06 01:46:44,ez8r4e,I posted this and got 12 likes you bastard lmao
21,2020-02-06 10:45:43,ez8r4e,One thing people don’t notice with how the picture is cut (this happens a lot in the WWE) if you keep your feet spread farther apart you lose a few inches. So if he was standing with a wider stance he will look shorter and with the camera angle you cannot tell the difference.
22,2020-02-05 21:06:04,ez8r4e,we're little too harsh on the rock..
23,2020-02-05 17:13:50,ez8r4e,He’s 6’2.5” other guy is wearing football shoes.
24,2020-02-05 16:42:29,ez8r4e,celebheights is your friend :)
25,2020-02-05 21:46:16,ez8r4e,Lmao I'm pretty sure hes around 6'2-6'3(max)
26,2020-02-05 23:45:03,ez8r4e,HAHAHHAHAHAHAH
27,2020-02-06 01:27:55,ez8r4e,from everything ive read about all this and all the videos made about it on youtube i'd say he's solid 6'3 but no higher than 6'3.5
28,2020-02-06 09:33:40,ez8r4e,"Lying about height is hardly unusual! No surprise it melted into the movie star world. I’m not insecure about it myself. But it’s great fun to look up the height of all kinds of stars, and discover that you’re taller than quite a few of the ones who are considered tall. Or perceived as tall. When I was in school I often towered over my classmates to some extent. And now I’m humble bragging. I’m really flashing my security right now :D"
29,2020-02-05 16:33:15,ez8r4e,"I've met him, and he is close, but I was bigger."
30,2020-02-05 16:54:00,ez8r4e,He’s probably 6’5” in wrestling boots
31,2020-02-06 00:23:45,ez8r4e,He's also listed at 6'5 from when he was at Miami playing football.
32,2020-02-05 15:06:57,ez8r4e,"He was a professional wrestler, so they always plus up their stats."
33,2020-02-05 13:37:12,ez8r4e,He’s 6’1.5 max a youtuber made a video about it
34,2020-02-05 17:14:45,ez8r4e,"I met The Rock a couple of years ago in a restaurant.  Super kind and gracious man.  Frickin' huge muscles, but there's no way he's 6'5"""
35,2020-02-05 15:41:36,ez8r4e,"The whole 6'5"" thing just came from his wrestling days where they embellish everything."
36,2020-02-05 15:37:39,ez8r4e,also wouldn't Jimmy be in cleats here?
37,2020-02-05 14:19:08,ez8r4e,I’ve always thought he was 6’5. I’ve been watching him for years.
38,2020-02-05 20:02:03,ez8r4e,"I was gonna say that, when I was growing up he was never 6'5"
39,2020-02-05 21:25:47,ez8r4e,In jumanji the remake Kevin hart says that hes 6'4
40,2020-02-05 22:41:56,ez8r4e,Could be he’s just shrinking with age. My dad’s gone from 6’4 to 6’1.5 within the last decade
41,2020-02-05 16:32:41,ez8r4e,Geology joke. Solid.
42,2020-02-05 18:40:39,ez8r4e,This joke rocked my world
43,2020-02-05 13:36:06,ez8r4e,"Actually though, when I played football high school my coaches recorded me as being 6’2 (I was 6’4) because colleges didn’t recruit centers that were too tall."
44,2020-02-05 19:44:24,ez8r4e,"NFL players are measured barefoot, so it’s likely that Garoppolo is 1-2 inches taller in cleats."
45,2020-02-06 12:36:00,ez8r4e,"First off this is all speculation and I could be wrong BUT

I think he might’ve actually been 6’5 at the beginning of his wwe career, if not 6’4. In this picture he looks more 6’3 (he looked shorter because he tilted his head) and people get shorter as they age."
46,2020-02-05 17:06:36,ez8r4e,He's 6'3-6'3.5 I've met him in person and im 6'4 and was just barely taller than him
47,2020-02-05 14:41:00,ez8r4e,And one probably is using legacy promo wrestling height. To be Fairrrr
48,2020-02-05 14:41:13,ez8r4e,He’s wearing heels
49,2020-02-06 01:56:07,ez8r4e,Haha sorry man
50,2020-02-05 20:48:51,ez8r4e,[removed]
51,2020-02-05 15:39:38,ez8r4e,"So is Hulk Hogan not 6'7, and like Dwayne is a few inches shorter?"
52,2020-02-05 13:49:31,ez8r4e,I just knew that on Google he was listed at like 6'2
53,2020-02-05 14:11:33,ez8r4e,Got a link for that vid? I am intrigued.
54,2020-02-05 14:51:12,ez8r4e,"Before I looked up his height I thought the same thing, he's still huge, but now he's considerably less huge."
55,2020-02-05 13:49:19,ez8r4e,"I did the same thing in high school for basketball. Not for college recruits or anything. We played a lot of games out of our conference, so there were teams that only had our stat sheets. I claimed to be 6'1"" when I am 6'5"" (strong 6'6"" in shoes), and I just enjoyed the shocked look on the face of the person lining up against me. In retrospect, it might have been a form of cheating. Planning for how you guard/being guarded by people can effect how you run the game.

6'5"" fist bump."
56,2020-02-05 13:37:31,ez8r4e,I think he was being sarcastic
57,2020-02-05 18:30:13,ez8r4e,Tall center gang
58,2020-02-05 20:56:53,ez8r4e,Both.
59,2020-02-05 15:47:15,ez8r4e,"hulk was 6’6 bare foot in his prime and 6’7 or possibly 6’8 with boots on 

when he wrestled with rock he lost 3 inches because his spinal and legs injuries which made him 6’3"
60,2020-02-05 14:06:22,ez8r4e,"imdb calls him 6'5""

\[doubt\]"
61,2020-02-05 14:31:21,ez8r4e,I checked YouTube but was unable to find that video .
62,2020-02-05 15:50:07,ez8r4e,Check in celebheights.com and the YouTube channel ‘Rob Paul’
63,2020-02-05 17:54:20,ez8r4e,"Our media guys didn't update my stats in the media guide for a few years so I was listed at 6'10, 245. You can imagine the looks I got when I walked out at 265-270. Fun times."
64,2020-02-05 15:22:55,ez8r4e,"I learned a great phrase in my time in service:  “If you’re not cheating, you’re not trying.  And if you got caught, you weren’t trying hard enough.”  Admittedly the stakes are a but higher there, but your “cheating” seems pretty innocuous."
65,2020-02-05 13:37:46,ez8r4e,No shit

67,2020-02-05 16:55:56,ez8r4e,Imma go watch Suburban Commando or Mr Nanny now.
68,2020-02-05 22:05:27,ez8r4e,Wrestling uses something called billed height.  It's usually a few inches taller.
69,2020-02-05 21:21:19,ez8r4e,You can tell the page is inaccurate because it calls him an actor.
70,2020-02-05 14:31:48,ez8r4e,Damn. Thanks for looking though!

74,2020-02-05 13:43:06,ez8r4e,"Yeah, no shit."
75,2020-02-05 22:32:08,ez8r4e,"Definitely a lot of fat in there now, but even years ago when I was playing sports and working out with minimal body fat, I was still bigger. Very broad shoulders, big chest, etc. Some people are just big. Skinny for me is still a 48 ~ 50"" chest. It sucks trying to buy clothes. At the time I met him, I was in great shape, though not training shape."
76,2020-02-05 22:17:42,ez8r4e,weird... I could've sworn I've seen him in movies
77,2020-02-06 15:45:00,ez8r4e,"Well, I played basketball, not football, so it wasn't totally a shock."

94,2020-02-10 11:58:55,ez7rkx,kind of new so really dont understand what you are saying
95,2020-02-05 09:58:19,ez6uc8,"4-5 is not ""a baby"" anymore. That's more than old enough to understand ""You need to be quiet now."""
96,2020-02-05 20:37:34,ez6uc8,Isn’t the entire premise of the movie about a group of fire fighters being annoyed by children? I have no idea what you thought you were gonna get out of this
97,2020-02-05 10:02:56,ez6uc8,"I know! But that was the script. Just, UUUUGH. And this is a little past the 30 minute mark of the movie, and this girl's getting on my last nerve. I can handle being touched and everything - I wanna believe I can be very generous with physical affection and playful attention. But when you begin clinging onto my leg like a dog trying to hump me while I'm trying to walk around, expect some vigorous shaking, because I'm not having that shit. You are not a tick, a piece of lint, or one of those prickle seeds. You are a little girl - GET OFF MY LEG!"
98,2020-02-05 20:45:49,ez6uc8,"Yes, but like I said, I had seen The Game Plan, and didn't have any qualms with it. Peyton (the little girl from The Game Plan) did some shit was was annoying, yet funny at the same time. It was a bit more relatable, as I compared it to me and my sister. As in, me doing things that I wanna do, but my sister fucks it over somehow.

This movie, however, took it up a notch. Peyton screamed maybe three times in the whole movie, and each time was a short burst of frustration - the little girl in this movie was obnoxious, screaming for little to no reason other than because she can. I was prepared for childish shenanigans (and actually looked forward to it), but this just made me annoyed for some reason. A little more than normal."

109,2020-02-05 04:17:59,eyz67m,I think that the team should draft a QB in every draft. Even if theyre just churning the 3rd QB slot. Even if they have a superstar.
110,2020-02-05 15:36:00,eyz67m,if this were a plot point graph then RGIII would be the huge outlier and any statistician worth their salt would tell you that data point is skewing the results.

Literlly cannot imagine anyone as a good Griffith, he's a one of a kind being lol.

I mean this might as well be a shot from a live action Berserk adaptation: http://www.media1.hw-static.com/wp-content/uploads/immortals_55014883-1000x643.jpeg"
133,2020-02-05 00:17:44,eyp8g1,He’s perfect right?
134,2020-02-13 19:48:23,eyp8g1,Holy shit I forgot about timothee yes!!!! I fckin love this haha
135,2020-02-05 00:23:55,eyp8g1,LOL I actually never knew that and now I'm genuinely shocked! I really wanna see Cavill in the Witcher series to see if he can pull off such a role.
136,2020-02-05 02:49:36,eyp8g1,Jeez this kinda got me. A nice photoshop of this image being during the Eclipse with Guts fighting off apostles >>>>. But YES definitely the same facial structure.
137,2020-02-05 00:28:17,eyp8g1,He’s pretty good in the witcher but mostly coz he’s a fan of the game so he was serious with the role but if u grew up with the image of Gerald from the games you’d still think he looks to clean cut for the role. Guts never had a beard so a barefaced Cavill wouldn’t be able to do his roughness enough justice. Plus Momoa looks cool with scars. But he really needs to work on his acting though coz Guts is more than just a stoic dude who rages when he fights.

You forgot Dave Bautista who is the only one who can act among the three and is more successful than John Cena ."
140,2020-02-04 17:41:50,eymla7,"I cannot believe you didn't mention the boy, Batista.

Batista is actually a really good actor with range and knows how to become a character. While I love Rock and Cena, they are mostly just playing themselves in the movies, just with a different name."
141,2020-02-04 09:57:05,eymla7,"Liev Schreiber was actually amazing casting, it's too bad he was wasted in crap movies.

I think Marvel should allow the X characters to lie fallow for a few years to avoid fatigue."

144,2020-02-04 09:11:45,eymla7,His neck problems would likely limit his physical capabilities.
145,2020-02-04 10:06:52,eymla7,Is Cena successful?
146,2020-02-04 08:17:57,eymla7,"Imo Edge is too old to be Creed now.

Triple H in his prime would've been perfect. Especially when his character is similar to Creed anyhow. Or at least was before Creed's infamous villain decay.

But he's too old & bald now too. So I am still on the Jason Momoa train for my dream Sabretooth. Soon as he grows his hair back. lol"
147,2020-02-04 16:55:51,eymla7,Bingo.

Whoops."
150,2020-02-04 17:49:02,eymla7,"Yeah, it is pretty embarrassing, especially after how well he did in Blade Runner 2049 and GOTG 1 and 2."
151,2020-02-04 09:36:21,eymla7,Considering he just delivered a ton of spears at the rumble then took an RKO and a con-chair-to on Raw I think he’ll be alright.
152,2020-02-04 20:45:43,eymla7,"I think he's good now. Nerve damage repairs at a rate of roughly 1/4 inch a year and he had his first retirement a decade ago. It's slow going, but between the natural repair rate and his efforts to get the injury fixed (I'd be willing to put money on him using stem cell therapy at some point) I think he's mostly fjne now. Of course, he should still be cautious, but I think as long as he's aware of his injury and protects it, he'll be fine."
153,2020-02-04 17:17:54,eymla7,"he was out of the game for a long time too, if he wanted to try acting I think he might have gone for it."
154,2020-02-04 11:54:10,eymla7,"15+ years leading the WWE, a slew of movies over the past decade or so, commercial deals, and setting the record for most Make A Wishes sounds pretty successful to me."
155,2020-02-04 19:39:33,eymla7,Bald people can wear wigs. Even the actors with a full head of hair may be wearing one.
156,2020-02-04 16:59:07,eymla7,"Yeah, Triple H would have been great!"
157,2020-02-04 09:39:34,eymla7,Perhaps. I'm just one of the people who doesn't want him to take any more risks like that.
158,2020-02-04 17:17:12,eymla7,"he is a successful person, but I wouldn't call him successful on his movie career though."
159,2020-02-04 16:59:47,eymla7,"Totally fair.

They could compensate with stuntmen and special effects for the more dangerous stuff."
160,2020-02-07 05:04:45,eymla7,Most of his movies are box office success so he is definitely successful in his movie career
161,2020-02-04 19:38:50,eymla7,Depends on how you define a successful movie career. No he isn't the Dwayne but he's get's plenty of roles that make it to theaters.
162,2020-02-07 05:45:20,eymla7,most? check again buddy.

181,2020-02-04 00:42:59,eyh7tv,"> Tell me the top heel has to be mean and ruthless but know when they have to be funny and offended.

That's Lesnar. He is THE top heel. He fits all of those. 

Corbin, however, is pushed to be an absolutely obnoxious heel but he's not a top heel like Lesnar. He's good for transition feuds."
182,2020-02-04 00:56:51,eyh7tv,"It's definitely not unpopular. Corbin has been better than expected in a lot of people's eyes, he had a long way to go in a short period of time and is excelling.  Is he the best Heel?  Is he a main eventer... no, but he has done everything asked of him and way more."
183,2020-02-04 00:43:36,eyh7tv,"The thing with Corbin is that he's not a main event heel, or maybe not a long-program main-event heel and more of a one-off program main event heel who loses to a babyface champion to put them over as a strong champion for real contenders. 

They consistently try to push him as a main event heel and it just doesn't work, he's not at that level."

186,2020-02-04 01:05:24,eyh7tv,his feud went on and on and on way too long. like the one with Seth and later with Reigns. that's what made people tired at him. just make it a tight fun feud that actually ended at a PVP and it'll be good.
187,2020-02-04 02:53:00,eyh7tv,"I mean, he’s doing his job, I hate him, I don’t know if it’s for the right reasons"

189,2020-02-04 01:06:28,eyh7tv,I’ve been saying that for months. The dude is just a mid card heel. He should be feuding with and losing to guys like Ali and Ricochet instead of being the primary focus of shows.
190,2020-02-04 00:55:03,eyh7tv,"I loved how Corbin was genuinely nice when The Rock asked if ""that's what he thinks""

191,2020-02-04 01:07:54,eyh7tv,Yeah even on UUDD he’s a very quiet guy. Like he jokes around and talks shit. But he’s very calm and quiet
192,2020-02-04 00:56:32,eyh7tv,You think? It seems a lot of fans on here really don’t like it compared to a straight heel like Jay White or MJF.

Jay White as a wrestler is head and shoulders above the other two, no one can touch MJF on the Mic and Corbin is an absolute heat magnet.

From there, it gets more complicated. Sleep, stress, environment, even the soap you use can affect your microbiome. Remember antibacterial soap? Yeah it was banned because it killed good bacteria and left bad bacteria to multiply unchecked. 

&#x200B;

How can I tell my hormones and gut are doing better? First off, willpower ain't a thing for me anymore. It's almost like emotional attachment to food is gone - that is NOT through any magical ""willpower"" effort on my part. It just happened. Many people on here have made comments about food no longer having any hold on them anymore. The changes started happening within days of changing my eating habits. This is because my gut microbiome was changing. Cravings changed from sweets to veggies quite quickly.

&#x200B;

The other way I can tell is...my poop. I've been keto/IF for 8 months. I'm pooping the best poops of my life right now. Lol! For a few months it was rough going. Now things have stabilized.

&#x200B;

I highly recommend you dig more into the current gut microbiome research happening today."

I just think it’s ridiculous to say willpower is bullcrap. There is 100% a mental aspect to starting and sticking with any diet. Yes once you make and commit to those changes, it has a very positive impact on things like cravings, but you need the mental fortitude to get there in the first place. Do you not?"

We can pretend that the Castle is containing a Predator who crashed to Earth at some point in time (Say WW1 to match with one of the star's more famous scenes.) and our group of leads are sent to check out the Castle and see what's going on. They arrive and they find that the previous team have been massacred and the Predator has escaped but it's still within the confines of the Castle. They need to find the Predator and kill it so they can come back home alive. The bolded names survive the movie.

**Gal Gadot:** Israel-born smarty-pants, served with a U.N. research team before getting hired for the Castle project. 

**John Boyega:** Young, smart soldier fresh out of two tours of Iraq and wanting something else in life.

Michael Keaton: The veteran, has always been aware of what the Castle contained and is the only one who is ready to tackle the issue.

Terry Crews: Former NYPD cop, the comic relief of the group."

I could definitely get behind Winston Duke, especially if his easily-unnerved disposition leads to either himself or another teammate killed. 

That would be a great role for Donnie Yen. I could imagine him lasting a good long time against the Predator, even hunting the hunter for a while."

People have been saying that our offense would be too congested if they played together, but to me the defensive boost you get from playing those two far out weighs whatever problems happen with the offense. Besides, DJ and White are not bad offensive players, the offense will not tank if they play together.

379,2020-02-02 05:25:05,exipst,The Hornets scored 27 points in the 2nd half!!
380,2020-02-02 06:12:52,exipst,My first game I’ve attended all season. Energy in the second half was amazing.
381,2020-02-02 06:34:16,exipst,"Man we really need to pull W’s together this RRT. Literally the RRT is likely our last chance to make a push.

We’re mainly fighting for the last seed."
382,2020-02-02 13:05:07,exipst,"We need a guard who’s able to shoot 3 pointers and is not horrible on defense. I see that one of the worst teams in the league, the Warriors, have one that is also currently injured, maybe they are interested in some future assets for that guy Curry."

396,2020-02-02 07:28:31,exipst,Now imagine a year of Austin under his belt (much like Derrick). Can't wait for this summer and summer league with him. He's going to be balling out and dominating as a 2nd year guy.
397,2020-02-02 06:41:09,exipst,Does patty have the biggest dick? WE DONT KNOW OTHERWISE IM DRUNK
398,2020-02-02 04:15:15,exipst,They match the San Antonio weather
399,2020-02-02 07:27:36,exipst,"Yes, Spurs have a few old vets, but they live and die by inconsistent youth: 

White + Murray (sub in Jakob's scoring tonight) have to play well on top of the vets (DeMar/LMA/Patty/Gay-but mostly MIA), otherwise, you get iffy games overall since Gay has been really inconsistent. And Bryn just hasn't found his touch this season."
400,2020-02-02 07:30:14,exipst,"The one area where Spurs have a great sales pitch to Jakob is he doesn't have much competition at the big, for a long future with SA. That's solid. LMA getting his 3pt shot helps make it easier as long as Jakob develops more of his offensive game. I'm pretty sure he'll be back. I think both sides would like that."
401,2020-02-02 04:15:05,exipst,"Spurs have been doing it all year! We've only had a few blowout losses. Most of the games, and losses have been tight in the final few of the 4th"
402,2020-02-02 07:31:11,exipst,His confidence looks like it's killed his game overall. Since his 3pt shot dropped off big it's really hurt his overall game. He needs the shot more these days since he doesn't have the same speed he used to have in younger years.
403,2020-02-02 13:33:25,exipst,"The Grizzlies have the toughest remaining schedule I believe (.54) , but Portland’s (.48) is easier than ours (.51)"
404,2020-02-02 07:21:04,exipst,"I would also like to point out that since their offensive issues seem to be confidence related, putting them in a spot where they have to start shooting may cause one or both to have positive breakthroughs in their game 🤷‍♂️"
405,2020-02-03 11:48:07,exipst,"I think everyone knows that. The only concern there is if DJ and White are both starting, Patty and Bryn will be our bench backcourt.

Mills + Forbes: great spacing, great shooting, abysmal defense"
406,2020-02-02 04:22:27,exipst,"Upvote fam. My girlfriend is on me about the shit. She’d probably suspect me first if Brynn Forbes went missing or something, but I just want him to play better and not get so high or so low when good/bad things happen."
407,2020-02-02 14:27:18,exipst,Agreed! I know personally I’ve been way too negative
408,2020-02-02 05:20:12,exipst,Milwaukee and Boston funnily enough.
409,2020-02-02 04:15:50,exipst,I don't think there is such possibility. We don't have a shooter at 2.
410,2020-02-02 14:18:56,exipst,"I looked up how many minutes Poeltl, Dejounte, and DWhite have played together this year. Including last night, its 7 minutes. 

This stuff is criminal, we need those 3 building blocks trying to play together. I'm so frustrated about rotations and minutes distribution this yr."

415,2020-02-02 15:36:21,exipst,"DJ has a pretty decent offensive game, didn’t he?"
416,2020-02-02 04:31:34,exipst,"Hahah, well now if he goes missing I will suspect you too. I've been sliding into his DMs since I became single back in October 😂 But on the real, this season has been frustrating as hell so I've been trying to change my mindset. Maybe it's all those Frost Bank ""opt for optimism"" commercials during free throws lol"
417,2020-02-02 04:27:06,exipst,Tbh rather have patty start and have marco come off the bench as the second sg behind him

423,2020-02-02 22:37:51,exipst,"LOL, how many of those 3's are running off screens? Bryn's been bad, but he is a far better shooter than either of those. How about you pay attention and watch Lonnie's movement, he doesn't even know the god damn sets..."

425,2020-02-03 01:10:54,exipst,"Typo on my phone. Meant to say “had”, as in he had a good offensive game last night."
426,2020-02-03 01:53:45,exipst,and where is he supposed to learn those sets if not in games?
427,2020-02-03 02:00:58,exipst,He's been playing? It's called film and practice.
428,2020-02-03 18:16:43,exipst,NBA teams don't practice much. Of course you'll never understand that.
429,2020-02-03 20:05:37,exipst,I know they don’t. There is no excuse he hasn’t learned the sets yet while being in the program for almost 2 years while poetl and demar learned it in half a season. Of course you’ll never understand that because you don’t have a shred of b-ball iq
430,2020-02-03 23:45:18,exipst,he has played 514 minutes dumbo and a lot of it was garbage time. 118 minutes the year before which was all garbage time. You're really the dumbest poster on here
431,2020-02-04 00:00:22,exipst,"Like I said, Poetl and Demar learned the system in half a season. Quit making excuses for them you moron. Patty's job is to play basketball, not direct him where to go on the court. Nice try though."
432,2020-02-04 00:37:57,exipst,514 minutes are less than half a season fuck boy. Learn mathematics lmao
433,2020-02-04 01:06:32,exipst,"You think Poetl was playing 48 minutes for half a season? Oh no, you need to learn some common sense wow. Do they teach that in high school these days?"
434,2020-02-04 06:03:54,exipst,Poeltl was a starter last season. Damn are you dumb. This slice of bread that I got here is smarter than you. You're going in circles lmao
435,2020-02-04 06:08:05,exipst,Poetl didn't start at the beginning of the season and didn't start until he learned the system. Nice try again you absolute moron. I know McDonalds is a tough job for you brotha but I believe you can become a manager one day.
436,2020-02-05 03:23:13,exipst,lmao you still don't get it rofl. Do you even have a license?
437,2020-02-05 03:28:46,exipst,? You've made no logical points. I'm starting to doubt if you even graduated middle school let alone high school.

With Tendulkar it's difficult because he's also associated with a lot of things like first player to make an ODI 200, winning the world cup, singlehandedly bearing India in the late nineties and of course the desert storm wizardry. Rohit is great, but not sure if the total sum of his achievements can quite counter the Little Master's."
503,2020-03-28 12:50:22,fqhk16,"Asks the question 

> Did Sachin in fact face Akram, Donald, Waqar, Ambrose and McGrath more than Rohit faced Cummins, Starc, Steyn, Boult

Your own post says Sachin faced McGrath 22 times, Wasim 16 times and Waqar 17 times. You conveniently left out Murali in this list though the legend has 534 wickets and yet Sachin averages 63 being dismissed only 3 times. Whereas Rohit has literally played Starc et al for a small handful of times.

The rest of your post, IMO, is window-dressing.

The only difference the arrival of Rohit has made? That if I had to pick an all-time India ODI XI I would now pick him to partner Sachin over Saurav or Sehwag."
504,2020-03-28 11:31:23,fqhk16,Another thing to remember is the longevity Tendulkar's career had. The guy played a lot of matches for a lot of years. Rohit is great but he hasn't played nearly as enough matches as Tendulkar.
505,2020-03-28 19:19:51,fqhk16,"Tendulkar would've been as destructive, if not more, had he played in the modern era. Rohit on the other hand, looks absoutely clueless even at the hint of swing, if he had played in the 90s with such challenging pitches then he would be a walking wicket. Someone like Colin de Grandhomme looks like a very easy bowler to score, but if he played on pitches that suited bowlers then he would be a real threat (see WC19 Final where a bowling pitch made him look like Sir Curtly Ambrose).

The difference is that Rohit is a great of only his generation, while Tendulkar is an all-time great."
506,2020-03-29 00:45:18,fqhk16,"Using your logic, does that mean Rohit Sharma is better than Viv Richards as well? 


Let’s be honest. West Indies was the only team that could actually play ODIs decently while other teams were struggling with the transition from Test cricket to ODI cricket."

511,2020-03-28 21:21:25,fqhk16,So you are saying rohit > sachin and we all know kohli > rohit so the conclusion i got from this post is kohli > sachin?

513,2020-03-28 17:02:03,fqhk16,"Rohit is also very lucky.We also have drs now btw , he was dropped 4 times times below 10 in WC and he scored a century each time. Powerplays ,2 new balls and still wasn't able to break sachins record of most runs in a WC and let us not forget that David Warner was just 1 run behind him.

He's a legend no doubt just pointing it out

Sachin on the other hand wrongly given out soon many times."
514,2020-03-28 13:04:32,fqhk16,"Quick question, did you read the whole thing or at least most of it, or did you look at the numbers and then assumed I was saying Rohit > Sachin? Cause I didn't compare them face to face. If anything it was a comparison on eras. Cricinfo was the one comparing the players I stated and used as examples, and I went with what majority of the answers were.

Now regarding why I apparently left out Murali? Well, here is why. Firstly that's what the arguments on social media listed. They didn't list Muralitharan. Secondly Murali isn't going to open the bowling against Sachin. It will be Vaas and mostly likely Zoysa as I pointed out. You would if you read the thing noted why Starc featured less and why Wasim and Waqar weren't in the most matches played against. Heck they barely opened together. One of them was either with Aaqid Javed or Shoaib Akhtar.

If you want to take it as Sachin v. Rohit, go nuts. Cause I noted the positives and negatives for each era."
515,2020-03-28 13:08:00,fqhk16,For sure and I did note that. Of course Tendulkar would have played more plus he had those really stupid random tri series that he played. Feel bad for him. I wouldn't want to play a tough series at him and then go to Sharjah to play an ODI series and then fly to Dhaka.
516,2020-03-30 04:42:11,fqhk16,The only logical comment in thsi thread
517,2020-03-28 13:14:40,fqhk16,"Lol I knew what I was getting myself into. Man, if people wanna take it as I think Rohit is better than Sachin, then I can't do much about it cause I ain't wanna get into arguments lol"
518,2020-04-01 13:46:43,fqhk16,"Rohit is currently matching Kohli in ODIs. He's been averaging like 59 since last few years which is almost same to Kohli's. 

Also there's not much difference between the number of centuries they scored in last few years, Rohit scoring 28 and 29 for Kohli."
519,2020-03-28 16:56:57,fqhk16,Have to consider run inflation
520,2020-03-29 03:05:02,fqhk16,I agree with your sentiment but this is a _terrible_ argument.
521,2020-04-01 13:39:12,fqhk16,Warner played one more inning than Rohit btw and yet he was one run behind him.
522,2020-03-28 20:45:03,fqhk16,"I read the whole thing, actually. I was hoping there was something in it that would make me reevaluate my choice of Sachin as the best Indian ODI batsman ever; however most of your post was just window-dressing especially the list of bowlers. What's the point?"
523,2020-03-28 13:22:45,fqhk16,"Good luck, pitchforks have already come out!"
524,2020-04-01 15:20:02,fqhk16,Wasn't dropped in 4 matches though
525,2020-03-28 13:23:33,fqhk16,Gives people a chance to have a target that's not COVID-19
526,2020-04-01 15:22:25,fqhk16,Is that Rohit's fault that he was dropped by opponents?
527,2020-04-02 07:11:28,fqhk16,I like how you didn't reply anything but just silently downvoted lol.
528,2020-04-02 07:36:52,fqhk16,"Aww Rohit fan care so much.
Waiting for my reply.

Adorable

I don't like replying to statements that don't lead to a discussion.
Yours was stupid

I was just comparing them and pointing out that it wasn't an extraordinary feat.
As compared to sachin's

Yes it's pretty fucking clear he played one more still one behind
Rohit>Warner

But Rohit dropped 4 times still only a run ahead
You be like
Rohit>Warner

Cuz muh Rohit no fault he got dropped 

See the thing is
If Rohit wasn't lucky he wouldn't be the top run scorer, but who knows he might have done big in the semis.
But he ran out of luck"
529,2020-04-02 07:48:50,fqhk16,"Lmao I don't care. 

Your argument itself was stupid from the start as other commenter pointed out. 

The luck thing blah blah is quite a stupid thing to even say, maybe ask the opponents to practice more so they won't drop catches."
530,2020-04-02 07:54:01,fqhk16,"I didn't say it.

Until this ""I like how you didn't reply anything but just silently downvoted lol.""

And you say you don't care 

What's stupid is ""maybe his opponent ...........""

Who cares, he got lucky plain and simple, happens a lot in cricket.

I was pointing it out"

561,2020-03-27 16:25:15,fpqp1z,You seriously nobody over 30 was born @ Kaiser wow
562,2020-03-27 15:41:33,fpqp1z,Kaiser is one of the oldest hospitals around here.  I was born at Kaiser Hayward and that was over 50 years ago. But that building doesn’t exist anymore.

572,2020-03-27 02:11:35,fpmwso,This is why it's so painful that the Hornets are never good. There's so much talent here in high school and college.

576,2020-03-27 04:16:04,fpmwso,Where is Durant? I didn’t see him on the Wizards.
577,2020-03-27 00:21:22,fpmwso,I’ve always wondered but why can’t the Bay Area ever seem to generate basketball talent compared to everywhere else? High schools there seem to be able to compete with the rest of the state but don’t seem to send much nba caliber talent on.

581,2020-04-26 05:14:27,fpmwso,"Really well done. Would suggest: add a Team Europe and a Team Africa. 

Other than St Louis and Seattle was there any other concentration of NBA talent that didn’t have a team?"

Actually what's up with the Warriors? I thought thered be a lot of players from Oakland. I guess San Francisco area isnt a big basketball area."
586,2020-03-27 12:21:14,fpmwso,"As a rule, I only included players who have played a game this season.

Including 10 players who haven't, but are on rosters means Durant on the Wizards, Cousins on the Hawks and Wall on the Hornets."

589,2020-04-26 13:32:32,fpmwso,"Thanks for the compliment!

About the continental teams: Team Europe is interesting, but Team Africa would be heavily big skewed, so that's why I went the route of assigning ""American"" hometowns

Concentration of NBA talent: you could siphon off half of Charlotte's talent by placing a team in Raleigh, and you could probably center a team in Birmingham and take some of the players caught between Atlanta, Memphis and New Orleans"
590,2020-03-27 04:15:45,fpmwso,Idk I think the hornets are pretty stacked
591,2020-03-27 05:02:16,fpmwso,"Bledsoe Brogdon Brown Horford and Favors 

Is gonna beat

Curry, Chris Paul, Zion, Middleton, and Adebayo?

That's an easy sweep for Charlotte."
592,2020-03-27 00:25:00,fpmwso,"For sure it’s better if we do that, but I’m still not sure that would catch them up with other cities that are generally the same size if we”re doing historically for them too."
593,2020-03-27 05:15:54,fpmwso,Yes but it will go to seven games. Winning just win by less than 7 points. Brown and Lou will carry the offensive load while Atlanta playing tremendous defense.
594,2020-03-27 05:38:41,fpmwso,"Hell naw.

Charlotte just spams the Curry/Zion pick and roll and it's too OP Atlanta gets blown out every game of the series."
595,2020-03-27 07:12:27,fpmwso,Horfors or Favors will took care of Zion lmao. Rookie cant do shit vs veteran defenders. Maybe in three years but now? Hell naw
596,2020-06-08 17:03:36,fpmwso,Which veteran defenders this season shut down Zion?  He was a model of consistency in his first 19 games.  Broke the NBA record for most consecutive 20 point games by a rookie.  He cooked a number of the higher rated defenses in the league.
597,2020-03-27 12:35:02,fpmwso,Have you seen Horford play this year?
598,2020-03-27 13:20:39,fpmwso,"Because they have sync issue? and we al know how shitty sixers coaching staff and FO is, right? If Al is at the very least on an average coaching staff then he will be a beast."
599,2020-03-27 15:05:33,fpmwso,Its cuz he's old bruv. Nothing to do with sync issues. And if you think Zion cant do anything against Derrick fucking Favors then you're just stupid.
600,2020-03-27 16:09:07,fpmwso,Zion might be 8kgs heavier but it not just about it. Favors has been playing vs elite bodies in NBA for 7 years? While Zion? Hmmm. Stupid.
601,2020-03-27 16:14:22,fpmwso,Theres one thing you're forgetting. Zion is better than both of them. Hmmm... that might have an effect on the outcome.
602,2020-03-29 19:32:06,fpjdq5,gold
603,2020-03-26 11:43:21,fp7scy,"Superhero movies have a rich history of people attempting accents. Sure, we have Christain Bale, so dedicated that he did an American accent not just for the film, but for the press junkets as well. Plus there's many British actors (Henry Cavill, Tom Holland) who have adopted a flawless American accent. And the mostly African American/British cast of Black Panther all committed to an African accent, which turned out quite well. 

But then you have others that didn't turn out so well. Elizabeth Olsen gradually loses her vaguely Eastern European accent from Avengers: Age of Ultron (there's an in universe explanation, but the real reason is that it just wasn't very good, and her performance got better without it). Halle Berry's pseudo-African accent from X-Men disappeared in X2. And even Gal Gadot dropped her half-attempt at an American accent in BvS in Wonder Woman, while every other actress playing the Amazonians had to put on an accent so that Gadot's natural accent could be the Amazonian accent (it's kinda silly, but it mostly works, I guess).

So basically, you should only attempt an accent if you can actually do it, and do it well. Based on Dwayne Johnson's previous acting work, nothing suggests that he would be a master of accents, so I'd rather he just stick to his natural accent. I'd rather sacrifice realism if it means a better, more natural performance."
604,2020-03-26 08:51:22,fp7scy,Having an accent because he comes from a different place certainly adds uniqueness to his character and it kinda makes more sense.
605,2020-03-26 08:15:47,fp7scy,After Jumanji The Next Level I would say no. He kept dropping the old man voice
606,2020-03-26 08:47:42,fp7scy,Only if everyone else in Kahndaq does it. I don't think it's needed
607,2020-03-26 13:29:53,fp7scy,"Yes, i like the one they gave the character on Superman Shazam return of Black adam"
608,2020-03-26 11:47:28,fp7scy,"Yes, a West Virginia accent."
609,2020-03-26 09:47:29,fp7scy,"Yes. Black Adam is Quaraqi, he's an actor isn't he?"
610,2020-03-26 10:45:43,fp7scy,"To be honest... I sort of don't see the point unless they can do it consistently. I mean, if it's all set in ancient times, everyone is supposed to be talking fluently with each other in a language no one actually speaks any more. It had a certain charm with the Amazons... but they only did that because Gadot is unable to not speak with hers. So if you wanted the same in BA, the Rock would have to use an accent he normally doesn't have and which he is likely to forget.

The other way around is that if the movie is set in modern times, we are going to be dealing with a character thats around 6000 years old and has never heard or spoken English (which didn't even exist in his time) in his life. I think it would just be easier for one of his patron deities to make him able to speak english without bother... if it's something they want to address. (Aka, like how they just went with Krypton speaking English and never address why)"
611,2020-03-26 15:13:02,fp7scy,"Just speak normally, in a serious tone when needed, and light when humor calls for it."
612,2020-03-26 17:10:56,fp7scy,"Probably, it’s gonna be a very broad accent so I don’t think it’ll be hard."
613,2020-03-26 17:55:16,fp7scy,"I never understood they actors playing such roles should have an accent but still talk in English. If the film takes place in Kahndaq in ancient times, and everybody is supposed to speak in the same language, then let talk normally. If/When Black Adam comes to modern times and start speaking English then he can have an accent for a while. Its not that important to me. He learns English through his magic, right? So, why should he have an accent? What is important is what he says. His lines shouldn’t sound like usual Rock lines."
614,2020-03-26 21:42:05,fp7scy,He’d better speak with an accent.
615,2020-03-27 15:44:13,fp7scy,"Yes, but it depends upon how dialect coaching goes with him.

I don't want a Halle Berry in *X-Men 1* situation, but I can't say I won't be somewhat disappointed if Adam is speaking in a flat American accent.

Either way, he'll have to learn at least some phonetic Arabic unless they're really revising things or they're going to have the Kahndaqi people inexplicably speaking English."
616,2020-03-27 23:53:55,fp7scy,Stick to your guns.
617,2020-03-26 08:34:43,fp7scy,Nope. I found Robbie's accent quite distracting in both SS and BoP so i'd rather not.
618,2020-03-26 14:49:56,fp7scy,Fuck no
619,2020-03-27 05:01:21,fp7scy,"As someone who is “African” I can tell you, unequivocally, that the black panthers accents were mocked on the continent..."
620,2020-03-26 21:28:55,fp7scy,"I agree, he's not exactly a good actor, so him pulling off an accent sounds far fetched."
621,2020-03-28 13:21:56,fp7scy,I thought WW's American accent was her faking one for her alter ego Diana Prince
622,2020-03-26 09:42:29,fp7scy,"If he can do it, he should. 
But if he can’t, he shouldn’t."

634,2020-03-26 09:22:31,fp7scy,I found quite distracting tbh. So yeah i'd rather Dwayne not even attempt it

Just my opinion, though but i find forced accents distracting. I'm sure Black widow will be fun, but my god these Russian accents...."
636,2020-03-28 14:49:12,fp7scy,Oh. Oops. I thought she tried in certain scenes.
637,2020-03-26 09:40:11,fp7scy,"Do you mind if I ask where you’re from? 

Cause yes, Robbie’s native Australian comes through at a few places, but in general I thought it was a solid Brooklyn accent. She was a bit more all over the place in SS, but part of that was intentional IIRC. Far from the worst attempt I’ve heard and I just can’t imagine the minor slip-ups being enough to bother someone. 

Then again, I’m not from Brooklyn/NY, so I’m not the best judge."
638,2020-03-26 09:59:04,fp7scy,"I'm french. 

Sounds too forced for me. Like a caricature of Sorkin's accent. It's not the worst yeah but it's just not good to me and imo affects her overall acting. So i'd rather an actor focuses on his acting first. To her credit, she was better in BoP yeah and did a much better job in Wolf of Wall Street, but i imagine working with Scorsese is very different. It probably doesn't help that Harley's accent is quite over the top."

I feel it didn't get the attention it deserved despite being a movie you really only need to see once.  The storyline was something pulled from the mind of a game writer's head circa late 80s/early 90s.  Where it was trash, it was delightfully trash.  I enjoyed it being that cheesy.  It didn't try to be some grand overtaking from what was already out.  It was a one-time experience that wanted to take a different, rarely-used, perspective and run the shit out of it for the sake of having fun.  It did that with flare."

*most* days i keep my diet in check and i get over 2-3k cal used being active, but as much as its actually more difficult tackling these last 20 for me, im much more focused on being well defined when i hit my target weight because its 2-3hr of daily gym life for the entire weight loss/healthy active lifestyle journey ive been on the past 7 months now."
745,2020-03-24 01:51:56,fnnw9g,"Thanks, this was really inspiring. I’m at a similar place as your rock bottom - it’s cool to hear someone say they’re conquering that."
746,2020-03-24 02:42:45,fnnw9g,Wowser!

749,2020-03-24 11:28:15,fnnw9g,this made me smile so much !!! Congratulations !!
750,2020-03-24 12:53:56,fnnw9g,"Dude, you're a rockstar. Keep that good energy going"
751,2020-03-24 13:16:03,fnnw9g,"This is fabulous! Well done to you!! 🎉🎉🎉
I've lost 50lb and managing to keep it off so go us!!! 🙌🙌🙌"
752,2020-03-23 21:15:44,fnnw9g,"Thank you!!!

And congratulations to you as well on your 100LB!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Proud of you, stranger! I know how difficult it was. Lol as for the beard, I'm glad to hear a face bush sprouting up wasn't one of your side effects of weight loss! If you do wanna run the carnival route though, I hear boosting yourself with testosterone can help grow you one lol."
753,2020-03-23 22:23:48,fnnw9g,"Oh nah, I totally agree with this! When I was at my fattest, wearing nice clothes/dressing nice wasn't really something I felt was worth it. I just felt defeated from the get go and 'rationalized' it like, ""What's the point in the effort of going from a 0/10 to .5/10?"" lmao. It was a really stupid way to look at it. 

My problem at the moment is really just I'm still losing weight fast enough my sizes still change haha. I'm so CLOSE to wearing a 1X that when I hit 1X, I feel like I'll be at that size for a while. I'll feel a lot more comfortable dropping a bunch of dough on clothes at that point. I'm also excited to do this anyway. I could never find 3X or above at any of the good stores. I've NEVER in my life shopped at like an Express for example. 

Definitely right now nothing really fits well which sucks lol. My brother gave me my first pair of real brand name Jeans for Christmas. I was wearing a 44 (might sound silly, but I just didn't really realize they were too big? clothing that 'fit' has always been a challenge) and the jeans he gave me were a 38. That was like 20-30 pounds ago when I got that pair and now they're too big :( 

I've got a jar I'm putting spare cash in when I can for this. I want to have 1000 dollars saved for an entirely new wardrobe when I hit my goal weight! :)"
754,2020-03-23 21:16:32,fnnw9g,"Thank you so much! I feel like a different person. My life before May last year feels like foggy, like a dream now."
755,2020-03-23 21:16:46,fnnw9g,Thank you for taking the time to read it!
756,2020-03-23 21:22:37,fnnw9g,"You're so welcome, thank you for reading it! You're SO CLOSE to 100lb, you're gonna hit the point any time now! Unless you're done with weight loss for the moment, in which case you'll just kick ass at maintenance!"
757,2020-03-23 21:27:30,fnnw9g,"Thank you kindly, reddit stranger! <33 WAHOOOO"
758,2020-03-23 21:24:08,fnnw9g,"Thank you so much and I'm glad you find it inspiring!!! Knowing where I started from versus where I am now, it makes me wish to inspire as many other people like the old me to become like the new me!"
759,2020-03-23 21:29:20,fnnw9g,Aw thank you!! I'm so stoked to hear you found it inspirational! Maybe a lil more stoked for the humorous compliment! lmao. For real thank you for taking the time to read it!
760,2020-03-24 02:04:20,fnnw9g,Thank you so much dude! :)
761,2020-03-23 23:10:06,fnnw9g,"It wasn't easy to cultivate, but I love my new attitude too so THANK YOU!!! <3

I will definitely keep it up! Gotta hit below 200 for the first time... basically ever!"
762,2020-03-24 02:04:03,fnnw9g,"This is really touching!!!!!!!!!!! I really wasn't sure how to reply at first. I'm just so glad to know my experience could inspire you to turn around a potential zero day and make it a 100 day! I am so proud of you!!! I will definitely keep it up but I'll keep my weight down!!! 

You 1000% got this!!!!!!!!!!!"
763,2020-03-24 16:39:52,fnnw9g,Hahahaha it is so true because my chest hair has gotten out of control! lmao. I am like a freaking WEREWOLF now. The human body is bizarre and so fascinating lol.
764,2020-03-24 16:38:25,fnnw9g,"I'm really glad you said that, thank you!!! I feel like a different person in a lot of ways. Haha as I like to explain it, I've finally become a real person! lol. I'm so glad you took the time to tell me this, seriously! I wish you the best luck on whatever goals you have!!!"
765,2020-03-23 21:21:40,fnnw9g,"I agree! I think being active to their ability is the most important thing. I can't remember which Joe Rogan guest it was now, but over the summer it was a Russian coach for some fighting based sport. He preached on the podcast 'Consistency over Intensity' and that really is what helped me learn it's OK to crawl before I walk lol. Like, small number example, if MON TUE WED THU FRI you want to do push ups, but MON you do 25 push ups and now TUE youre so sore you can only do 10, and then WED you're still sore so you only do 15, then THUR you can do 20 but now FRI you're sore again and you do 10. 

Instead, if you just did 20 every day and leave 5 in your tank and avoid going too intense, you'd get 100 push ups in the week instead of just 80. 

Thank you so much!!! Proud of you for sticking with it for 7 months, it isn't easy!"
766,2020-03-24 02:01:40,fnnw9g,"Man, I'm really touched to have you say that. You will absolutely conquer yours too! I know you will. I swear, if I can, ANYONE can. I used to give up ALL the time. The INSTANT it wasn't easy anymore, I stopped. I didn't want to be challenged for some reason. Now I enjoy it. Take photos of yourself, and keep taking pics as you go along. Find things as you drop the weight that you can get into you wouldn't have enjoyed when bigger. Gather up as many things in your new life as you lose the weight so that you have things to protect. So that when you deny yourself whatever your trigger food is, you have something tangible and fresh in your mind that you know a moment of weakness could put in jeopardy. The process, routines, none of it gets easier - but YOU become stronger mentally and so it eventually feels easy. One thing that helped me was thinking of myself as King and my body as my army. I control and route IT, not the other way around. Armies get hungry, but duty comes before breakfast. 

You 1000% will make like Alexander and conquer your rock bottom. If a random reddit stranger can believe in you, then I know you'll believe in yourself."
767,2020-03-24 16:38:34,fnnw9g,Thank you!!:)
768,2020-03-24 16:36:29,fnnw9g,"I hope the positive vibes can be more infectious than the Rona! I'm really glad I didn't do it either, I love being alive. Thank you so so so very much for writing this, it is very touching :)"

776,2020-03-24 03:17:52,fnnw9g,"Wow, thanks a lot! All very helpful and good for you for finding that strength, too!"
777,2020-03-25 00:16:28,fnnw9g,"You know, I've never given IF a shot! I hear good things about it all the time from Joe Rogans podcast & even from some people I've met in person. Was it easy for you to get started? I feel like if I go too long without eating I get woozy and dizzy. And of course congratulations on the 20lb!!!!!! 😁"
778,2020-03-25 01:51:24,fnnw9g,"Thank you!! I think it’s definitely worth it! I do 18-6 usually, and since I usually have a busy schedule, it doesn’t bother me at all. If anything, I feel like I have more energy and more control over my hunger. That’s not to say that I don’t get hungry sometimes, but being able to push through it until my fasting period is over makes it feel THAT much better to eat again! It took me a day or two to get into the swing of and for my stomach to stop getting as hungry. I was even able to get my dad into it, too, and he had a similarly quick adjustment. Other than that, if I fall off the horse for a day (which is kinda hard to do, since it’s a lifestyle change that I’m pretty used to by now), I don’t feel super guilty and it’s not that hard for me to start again. It’s super flexible, too! The intermittent fasting subreddit is also super helpful! Hopefully that helps!"

783,2020-04-21 12:24:33,g5a0o5,"Wow, he was a young guy too. His website Kentucky Fried Wrestling was great; I stumbled upon it maybe ten years ago and it really rekindled my interest in wrestling after a long absence.

We urge the UNSC, who we do not doubt sponsor peace and prosperity in the Gulf as well as the US, to begin an arms embargo on the FRA, as well as consider economic sanctions in response to them violating human rights by arresting lawful FRA citizens simply by accusing them of espionage (which is never proved and disgustingly cringe).

975,2020-05-07 20:43:25,g4ibis," No. Live action remakes are shit. Holy shit at that. 

Cartoons just don’t translate well to live action. They weren’t meant to be realistic and live action is. They’re literal opposites."
976,2020-10-13 10:08:26,g4ibis,"No, it won't happen, the movie itself was quite a controversy during it's release. There are nothing accurate in this film outside of the greek architectural theme. In fact even that wasn't accurate at all because Heracles lived during the Mycenean area (-1600 to -1100), not the Classical Times (-570 to -350). The story occurred at least 700 years before the Pericles golden age.

Another problem can be the muse who were played by black american singers in the original movie while the muse were greek in appearance. There will be backlash, not acceptable anymore

Disney should stop with live action movies who exist only to be a cash grab for the company"
977,2020-04-20 00:23:50,g4ibis,I would like that. Saw Dwayne Johnson's Hercules in theatre and 3D. Loved that movie.
978,2020-04-20 00:05:59,g4ibis,Hell yes.
979,2020-04-20 02:31:52,g4ibis,"The Disney version of [Hercules](http://manapop.com/film/hercules-1997-review/) was quite far from the Greek mythology so maybe you want to see them give us a version where Hercules is induced into a fit of rage and madness by Hera, making him kill Megara and all their children. That would look great on a lunch box."
980,2020-04-20 02:35:27,g4ibis,Nah. Don’t encourage their nonsense.
981,2020-04-20 03:35:04,g4ibis,Fuck these remakes. No. Just no.
982,2020-04-20 11:11:24,g4ibis,To go with the other two shite Hercules films we've had over the last 10 years? Fuck no. Let it die
983,2020-04-20 00:39:36,g4ibis,"There is a live action Hercules TV since 1992, not made by Disney. I believe Disney wanted to cash in cause of the Hercules tv. Overall Disney wants to cash in on remakes just cause of copyright expiration dates. They bought the rights to Moana (Hawaiian 1926 film) just so they say it’s a Disney original. They rather butcher movies faster just to keep the rights to it. If you yourself made a movie 30 years ago, couldn’t it be released free digital or even after 5 or 10 years after death."

986,2020-04-20 02:46:09,g4ibis,"They're relatively cheap to make, are making bank at the box office (which Disney needs after spending all the money in the world), and renew their copyright.

As long as they at least break even, they're going to continue to be made."
987,2020-04-20 06:24:17,g4ibis,They're here to stay unless people actually stop watching them. You can bitch about it pointlessly or have some fun and talk about how Disney would do a remake.
988,2020-04-20 06:26:38,g4ibis,Robin Hood is getting a remake and while there's a certain difference there it's just as over done of a story.
989,2020-04-20 05:20:02,g4ibis,But maybe the fact that this movie will have the Disney brand will help it do better at the box office. Disney is even planning a live action Peter Pan even though the story of Peter Pan has also been told many many times.
990,2020-04-20 01:13:36,g4ibis,But that’s true for every disney live action remake they’ve done. I think your thinking the same as me; Disney live action remakes are a weak idea.
991,2020-04-20 02:49:01,g4ibis,Like Hercules In New York?
992,2020-04-20 00:36:20,g4ibis,But that's my point. A live action Hercules doesn't have to tell the same story as in the animated version. Disney can make another fresh and new take on the story of Hercules.
993,2020-04-20 01:05:06,g4ibis,It could have the tone of a Brendan Fraser Mummy movie.
994,2020-04-20 02:46:25,g4ibis,I think the movie ruined the movie for me.
995,2020-04-20 00:41:44,g4ibis,Not enough as Peter Pan movies or Robin Hood movies.
996,2020-04-20 06:00:20,g4ibis,I think remakes can be good with things like Hercules because those are things that could really benefit  from remake as the cartoon well fun is just kind of bad but there was potential there for a better movie and with a live action they could improve.
997,2020-04-20 08:34:41,g4ibis,"It is a bit confusing. It seems that there's actually quite a few people who would like some remakes, but once it actually happens, the sub goes full circlejerk mode and suddenly everyone hates it. I personally don't mind them. The only one I've seen is The Jungle Book and I really liked it. I'm actually stoked for Mulan because I think it looks great."
998,2020-04-20 00:46:59,g4ibis,Yes. Make it like 300

1028,2020-04-19 23:45:36,g4hjv4,Can someone please tell me when the black widow update comes out on IOS
1029,2020-04-20 01:43:48,g4hjv4,"Well after the Warriors of the Sky why not add in the peeps from Big Hero 6. Would make for a decent epic quest. The Native T2 would be Baymax/Hiro (combat?), the crystal unlock could be Callaghan(combat villain) and then the rest of the team would be your regular unlocks.

Fred - combat

Go Go - speed

Wasabi - combat

Honey Lemon - speed"
1030,2020-04-20 03:30:08,g4hjv4,I really hope the fan favorite character man gorilla gets added
1031,2020-04-19 23:40:35,g4hjv4,but then the game would be over. plus your first universal nat t2 heroes are odin and surfer
1032,2020-04-20 01:03:53,g4hjv4,I had Spiral and Lady Deathstrike as mutants originally because they were mutant adjacent like Juggernaut and Deadpool are
1033,2020-04-20 01:44:03,g4hjv4,I am old comic read myself as well and I know maybe 99% of those character pre 2000's. I would love to have many of those add to game
1034,2020-04-20 01:02:59,g4hjv4,"Like 18 hours after the pre-update event ends. Also, daily question thread."
1035,2020-04-19 23:48:54,g4hjv4,no. :(
1036,2020-04-20 02:22:21,g4hjv4,"I think that they have been phased out of being in the Marvel universe in favor of them being their own separate thing under the ""Disney"" brand. I know Disney owns Marvel but the situation is more like having the Marvel characters separate from Disney princesses if that makes sense."
1037,2020-04-20 02:45:47,g4hjv4,"Honey Lemon - Speed? How dare you? She is a blaster if I ever saw one. Move over Doctor Strange, there's a new sorcerer supreme in town."
1038,2020-04-19 23:46:58,g4hjv4,I completely forgot Odin was in the game. Surfer I’ll give you.
1039,2020-04-20 01:28:56,g4hjv4,When does pre-update event end
1040,2020-04-20 02:28:00,g4hjv4,"But, but, they had Stan Lee and a super hero in BH6 :O. He can be our first Native T3."
1041,2020-04-20 01:31:16,g4hjv4,18 hours before the black widow update. he just told you.
1042,2020-04-19 22:49:02,g4h55j,Idk but the first movie I saw of his was probably Tooth Fairy I remember that being popular in my school
1043,2020-04-19 22:48:55,g4h55j,The Rundown. He was hilarious in it.
1044,2020-04-19 22:55:31,g4h55j,The Scorpion King
1045,2020-04-19 22:57:53,g4h55j,"He came onto my radar during Southland Tales, after I saw him in Be Cool, where he basically stole just about every single damn scene he was in, showing up even John Travolta in one hilarious moment. 

After Be Cool, I kept a look-out for him and Southland Tales, the finger-dancing was just so funny, I could help but notice him again."
1046,2020-04-19 22:48:58,g4h55j,CLEARLY The Game Plan
1047,2020-04-19 22:49:20,g4h55j,Fast and the furius made him an A-list no doubt.
1048,2020-04-19 22:50:43,g4h55j,"The dude is famous because he was a wrestler and the son of another famous wrestler. Nothing against the guy, but acting is not what made him famous and he's only maybe above average at best at it."
1049,2020-04-19 22:56:06,g4h55j,The one with Harvey Weinstein that we will never see...
1050,2020-04-19 22:58:50,g4h55j,CLEARLY
1051,2020-04-19 23:03:41,g4h55j,Probably Walking tall. It was a pretty good movie.
1052,2020-04-19 23:04:01,g4h55j,"It definitely helps as well knowing his a nice guy and very lovingly family oriented. With the audience knowing that, it automatically brings in box office numbers"
1053,2020-04-19 22:50:32,g4h55j,Haha just finished watching that movie 5 minutes ago. It's what made me post.
1054,2020-04-19 22:59:51,g4h55j,Wasn't that his debut? Good job he got a good agent haha
1055,2020-04-19 23:20:48,g4h55j,Ahh cool? So did you know about his wrestling background? Or just as an actor?
1056,2020-04-19 23:01:26,g4h55j,CLEARLY
1057,2020-04-19 23:00:46,g4h55j,"Yeah, being cast in that was massive"
1058,2020-04-19 22:58:21,g4h55j,Oh I know I know. But he took his wrestling fans with him for the box office and now his movies never fail even if they flop haha his the biggest draw in Hollywood right now. What movie role/choice do you think got him to be this big? Or maybe just a great agent lol
1059,2020-04-19 23:07:38,g4h55j,Just about to watch that now! I haven't seen it since it came out so thinking I'm going to be let down slightly haha got such good memory's of all the rocks early films because he was my hero! I do now see that I was starstruck though and the early movies are not as amazing as I thought; but there still great to me
1060,2020-04-20 01:42:22,g4h55j,"No, I had no idea who he was. Then I rewatched Southland Tales with someone who did know him and he mentioned it. I figured he was something like that, though, ex-bodyguard/bouncer/stuntman/football player or wrestler, i mean, look at the shape of him, he's like a cube.

Edit: sorry, I don't mean that in a bad way - I mean the guy like, LOOKS solid, like a human slab of muscle or something lol"
1061,2020-04-19 22:33:27,g4gurk,They should have Daisy talk but it's a boy rabbit voiced by Seth MacFarlane
1062,2020-04-19 22:49:13,g4gurk,"Well, the ""actor"" would have to be comfortable with barely showing their face and barely talking. Few actors have little hubris to do that. 

Doom Slayer - I'd vote for Karl Urban for Doom Slayer since he did wonders with Judge Dredd. 

The Betrayer - Djimon Hounsou

VEGA - Vega's Original Voice Actor for VEGA. Or Simon Maiden (who did STEM from Upgrade).

Marauder- Hugh Keays-Byrne (Immortan Joe in Fury Road)

Olivia Pierce - Tilda Swinton, spot on. 

King Novik - Marc Addy

Samuel Hayden - No one can replace Darin DePaul"
1063,2020-04-20 05:05:20,g4gurk,"I'm gonna have to disagree with the Doomguy suggestions, so far.

The Rock and Karl Urban were both in the first DOOM movie that came out in 2005.  Urban maybe pulls it off, based on the last several minutes of said movie... but I'm still thinking we need somebody else.

As another commenter mentioned, there is going to be little face-time for the actor behind the Doomslayer.  Very few lines, very little face-time.

I don't have a nominee for the role, myself.  I'm thinking early 30's, physically intimidating appearance...

That's about all I've got.

Casting for Doomguy is like trying to cast for Master Chief, or Gordon Freeman... or any other silent protagonist."
1064,2020-04-25 04:04:04,g4gurk,Was watching the expanse and thought that the Wes Chatham who plays Amos be a badass doomguy.  I’d pay to see him rip and tear.
1065,2020-04-19 22:33:58,g4gurk,That would be the funniest shit ever
1066,2020-04-19 22:57:39,g4gurk,"I gotta agree with most of em but I didn’t watch judge dredd but Karl does look like the eternal model,
For the betrayer I can see the idea why but he seems awfully buff (reason why I took Arnold) 
And for Maurauder I could see the voice so yeah true"
1067,2020-04-20 05:10:57,g4gurk,Master chief does have a voice tho
1068,2020-04-19 22:37:17,g4gurk,"And there's cutaways.

Oh man this is even more intense than when we walked in on those two Barons having sex"
1069,2020-04-20 05:21:24,g4gurk,"You are correct!  I suppose I should have said, ""mostly-silent-protagonist.""

The Doomslayer has a voice, as well!

""Big guts!""

Maybe I'm holding onto the source material too much, but I just don't feel that the Doomslayer should have a lot of speaking time.

Edit:  I would have the same sentiment for MC.  Yes, we hear Chief speak, but he doesn't speak much."
1070,2020-04-20 05:22:29,g4gurk,That’s why I originally proposed Jason momoa as well because game of thrones (Im still watching the first season :/) he was pretty silent most the time
1071,2020-04-20 05:39:07,g4gurk,"Whoops!  My bad.  I overlooked where you said Momoa.

I'm still going disagree, though.

Momoa is a fantastic actor, don't get me wrong.

But... And perhaps (probably) this is my own preference for things sticking as close to source material as possible...

But the Doomslayer is supposedly descended from Blazkowicz.

Momoa doesn't look like a Blazkowicz.

Idk... maybe I'm being too serious about it...

I just feel like the Doomslayer should be an unrecognizable force of destruction."
1072,2020-04-20 05:40:22,g4gurk,"Ye I can see where you go 

David Bautista could be good no?"
1073,2020-04-19 21:33:30,g4fus8,Fix News with more hard hitting news.
1074,2020-04-19 21:52:13,g4fus8,'Practice makes perfect.'
1075,2020-04-19 21:34:40,g4fus8,That's not social distancing and little redditors should be appalled.
1076,2020-04-19 20:20:11,g4em2v,"I was gonna say at first this looks like 6-10, 7-9 team, then I saw Wilson

He, Diggs, and honestly not a bad OL would manage to get 10-11 wins imo. Secondary and edge guys are pretty good too."
1077,2020-04-19 21:32:36,g4em2v,With that roster Tyrod Taylor probably plays some running back
1078,2020-04-19 20:33:52,g4em2v,"Are there no other running backs from the DMV? 

prosise is garbage"
1079,2020-04-19 22:37:15,g4em2v,Chase Young would look good on this roster next season.
1080,2020-04-19 22:42:19,g4em2v,I think Redskins fans would much rather have this team Diggs alone is a game changer
1081,2020-04-19 20:37:54,g4em2v,Kendall but not Kyle Fuller?
1082,2020-04-19 22:04:13,g4em2v,Thanks for doing these! Always fun to see.
1083,2020-04-20 10:50:15,g4em2v,I really dig these types of posts.  Hope the Eagles are up next
1084,2020-04-20 03:48:18,g4em2v,Vernon Davis retired
1085,2020-04-19 22:43:56,g4em2v,I'd love to see this done for the Cincinnati Bengals. Very cool series!
1086,2020-04-20 06:26:19,g4em2v,"Vernon Davis retired, you'll have to take Colts' Mo Alie-Cox who played basketball at VCU (no football team), and went to HS in northern VA"
1087,2020-04-20 14:14:22,g4em2v,"I work in Stafford Va, Falmouth is Stafford. Torry Smith played for Stafford High School."
1088,2020-04-20 14:21:54,g4em2v,"Kyle Long retired, my friend!"
1089,2020-04-19 20:23:01,g4em2v,"This series has been done like 3 times already 

Edit: You could also add Chase Young."
1090,2020-04-19 20:25:44,g4em2v,Virginia is a low-key great Football state.
1091,2020-04-20 18:14:18,g4em2v,"Also, this team will have Chase Young as well"
1092,2020-04-19 21:13:08,g4em2v,Wilson is the first person in the list tho...?
1093,2020-04-19 20:39:41,g4em2v,Anthony McFarland this year maybe
1094,2020-04-20 01:05:21,g4em2v,Bring Brian Westbrook out of retirement.
1095,2020-04-19 20:40:25,g4em2v,"Yeah this one surprised me. Kyle went to High School in Baltimore, Kendall went to High School is Olney, Maryland, which is closer to D.C. Then they both end up going to Virginia Tech lol."
1096,2020-04-20 13:01:58,g4em2v,I'll post the Eagles after the Bears!
1097,2020-04-19 22:48:51,g4em2v,[Here are the Bengals!](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/g05pbr/the_cincinnati_bengals_composed_of_players_who/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) Not sure why they weren't linked in the description.
1098,2020-04-19 20:30:56,g4em2v,"I gathered the data for these teams nearly a year ago, so I never really got around to adding the players from the 2020 draft lol. I did however include Chase Young in the description of this post since he's the best player in the draft and will probably be a legit Redskins next week."
1099,2020-04-19 20:26:59,g4em2v,Vick comes to mind
1100,2020-04-19 21:04:47,g4em2v,757 is high-key kinda great
1101,2020-04-29 03:20:39,g4em2v,I skimmed over it
1102,2020-04-19 23:32:28,g4em2v,Nice! Thanks
1103,2020-04-19 20:28:47,g4em2v,"Bruce Smith, original!LT, Tarkenton, The Barbers, the Sharpers, Plax, Kenny Easley, Gary Clark

The Virginia all time team would be a top 10 ten team easily."
1104,2020-04-23 14:42:35,g4em2v,"Lawrence Taylor,  Mike Vick, DeAngelo Hall, Jerrod Mayo, Bruce Smith are just 5 that immediately popped in my head and there's lots more. Not to mention (and this is crossover to NBA) but Allen Iverson is from there too and held so many high school QB records that when Vick came along he wasn't able to break all of them"
1105,2020-04-19 20:58:21,g4em2v,Kam Chancellor
1106,2020-04-19 20:10:43,g4egzj,They would merge into an entity known as Rock Diesel.

And

1113,2020-05-03 14:03:22,gcq9er,That Dwayne helps Brad Martyn sell heroin to kids and that his muscles are also fake

1119,2020-05-03 08:19:30,gcn0mw,"Oh yeah? Well I saw Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson at a grocery store in Los Angeles once. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn't want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.

He said, ""Oh, like you're doing now?""

I was taken aback, and all I could say was ""Huh?"" but he kept cutting me off and going ""huh? huh? huh?"" and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ""Sir, you need to pay for those first."" At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ""to prevent any electrical infetterence,"" and then turned around and winked at me. I don't even think that's a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

1176,2020-05-02 23:11:17,gcd5pz,Get punched in the face by Dwayne. Switch him out with Mike Tyson though.... I’m eating the eggs
1177,2020-05-02 23:23:52,gcd5pz,"Dwayne seems like a decent guy, I'm sure if I ask politely he'll just give me a light tap

If he used full power and aimed to dislocate my jaw, rhough, I would take the eggs, because a hospital can control allergic responses and bacterial infections, but cant fix completely destroyed speech muscles."
1180,2020-05-02 22:42:52,gcd5pz,Just wouldn’t eat lunch for a week more money and I didn’t get decked
1181,2020-05-03 00:18:10,gcd5pz,Ok either experience brief pain or have to endure horrific food poisoning
1182,2020-05-03 00:49:52,gcd5pz,You don't have to eat the eggs. It's just the only thing that you can have for lunch. Just go a week without lunch.
1183,2020-05-02 23:33:42,gcd5pz,"Dwayne’s a nice dude, I figure he’d be pretty gentle"
1184,2020-05-03 01:55:35,gcd5pz,I voted for the eggs because I feel I could recover from whatever illness I get from the eggs better than the concussion/neck snapping punch/ brain damage for the rest of my life.
1185,2020-05-03 02:11:39,gcd5pz,"Eggs. People think Dwayne Johnson I get to meet him but they don’t realise how much damage a punch can do. Concussions aren’t a laughing matter. They can lead to brain damage, memory loss and some even die from a single punch"
1186,2020-05-03 00:02:49,gcd5pz,It might kill you
1187,2020-05-03 00:13:49,gcd5pz,Neither sound very pleasant but I'd pick the first one as the pain would last less.
1188,2020-05-03 00:38:09,gcd5pz,He would shatter your face! At least when I get done with my shitty week of egg lunches I'll be alive.

Rotten eggs for a week is just gonna give me the runs. No cool story there."
1190,2020-05-03 01:32:42,gcd5pz,It would be an honor to be punched by him
1191,2020-05-03 01:33:11,gcd5pz,Dwayne cause that'd be hot
1192,2020-05-03 01:37:38,gcd5pz,i would be honored to get ko'd by dwayne johnson
1193,2020-05-03 01:51:48,gcd5pz,What kind of question is this?? The Rock can punch me in the face and then I'll fucking thank him for it!!
1194,2020-05-03 02:02:20,gcd5pz,I bet he'll let me touch his pecs afterwards

 know"

1 all day long. Put that on my tombstone."

1200,2020-05-03 05:41:02,gcd5pz, I'm sure what the rock is cooking smells WAY better than the eggs.
1201,2020-05-03 05:48:16,gcd5pz,"I hope I at least get lunch with him after, he's a cool dude"
1202,2020-05-03 05:54:40,gcd5pz,"Just take the punch, i'll heal from that. Id rather not have the memory of eating rotten eggs for a week"
1203,2020-05-03 08:07:24,gcd5pz,I'm proud of myself for getting eggs to 666 votes
1204,2020-05-03 09:15:51,gcd5pz,I'll pick Dwayne then sue him because he punched me
1205,2020-05-02 23:28:23,gcd5pz,"as long as he doesn't break my nose or jaw, I'm fine with that"
1206,2020-05-02 23:44:26,gcd5pz,Why would I care about the shits. I'm on quarantine anyway
1207,2020-05-02 23:47:57,gcd5pz,I would be so over!
1208,2020-05-03 00:10:28,gcd5pz,How hard is the punch?
1209,2020-05-03 00:28:16,gcd5pz,"We intentionally rot eggs to eat them, so what's a week of rotten eggs and tomatos to me?"
1210,2020-05-03 00:29:56,gcd5pz,Am I required to eat the eggs? Or is it an eggs or nothing deal? Never mind imma get punched by Dwayne Johnson and sue him for all he’s got.
1211,2020-05-03 00:32:14,gcd5pz,I crave for human contact even if it is a punch in the face
1212,2020-05-03 00:32:14,gcd5pz,I would allow the rock to rock bottom me peoples elbow me and destroy me he is the fucking rock also happy bday dwayne
1213,2020-05-03 00:33:21,gcd5pz,The Rock could run me over and I would apologise.
1214,2020-05-03 00:39:34,gcd5pz,I get to say i took a punch from the rock. Whats the choice here?
1215,2020-05-03 00:42:29,gcd5pz,I hate eggs
1216,2020-05-03 00:46:52,gcd5pz,pick eggs and have 2 eggs a day
1217,2020-05-03 00:54:04,gcd5pz,I mean eating rotten eggs for a week will do a lot more harm to you and you'll be in pain for a longer time than a punch in the face. You might feel it for at most a day. I've had food poisoning before a few years ago and it was horrible. I couldn't keep any food down for a few days and I was in a lot of pain. Would not want to do again.
1218,2020-05-03 01:23:01,gcd5pz,Looks like it’s water for a week because a punch by The Rock may kill ya
1219,2020-05-03 01:43:47,gcd5pz,I hate eggs they smell and taste awful. I would take a punch by Dwayne  any day of the week.
1220,2020-05-03 01:45:01,gcd5pz,Only reason I chose eggs was because I’m pretty sure I’d die
1221,2020-05-03 03:49:30,gcd5pz,"One of them has no downside, I'll let you decide which one that is"
1222,2020-05-03 04:13:41,gcd5pz,I'd pay Dwayne The Rock Johnson to punch me in the face who do you think you're talking to?
1223,2020-05-03 04:34:01,gcd5pz,Liars
1224,2020-05-03 05:47:40,gcd5pz,"No way you should take the punch, if it is full power you  will be wrecked. People have died or been put into a coma from being punched. And this is the Rock..."
1225,2020-05-03 05:54:47,gcd5pz,"C’MON DUWANG!!! GIVE IT TO ME!!! I CAN TAKE IT!!!

I don’t wanna get sick!!!"
1226,2020-05-03 07:47:01,gcd5pz,"D J seems to be a gentle character so I'd go with the bloejob, excuse me - punch"
1227,2020-05-03 08:08:38,gcd5pz,"Dwayne is a nice guy, so I'll tell him the situation and he will be gentle"
1228,2020-05-03 09:17:20,gcd5pz,I'm not risking death by food poisoning just to avoid a punch
1229,2020-05-03 09:24:01,gcd5pz,"The punch will heal. 

*The memories of rotten eggs will never heal.*"
1230,2020-05-03 10:52:03,gcd5pz,The Rock is a childhood and adulthood hero. I'm pretty sure I'd assimilate some of his power by taking damage. Or the best sleep of my life when I get knocked out
1231,2020-05-03 11:13:33,gcd5pz,Is it a pussy punch? Is it a cheek punch or a front punch?  Are the eggs gluten free?
1232,2020-05-03 11:29:06,gcd5pz,Punched by the Rock. They I can sue him and earn the monies! Mhwahahaha
1233,2020-05-03 11:42:13,gcd5pz,So eggs or die? Eggs
1234,2020-05-03 12:20:19,gcd5pz,Can I sue?
1235,2020-05-03 12:26:05,gcd5pz,"I get to meet the rock, what do you think I’m picking"
1236,2020-05-03 12:42:04,gcd5pz,The rock's punch can clearly kill me
1237,2020-05-03 12:51:33,gcd5pz,"Rotten eggs for lunch becuase I'm fasting, easy loophole"
1238,2020-05-03 14:43:03,gcd5pz,"I feel like Dwayne would hold back a little... like, just enough for bragging rights without any lasting damage."
1239,2020-05-03 15:11:16,gcd5pz,I've had food I didn't like thrown at me before and don't wish to go through that again. I'd probably go back into depression. I don't remember all of the things thrown at me but I remember sandwiches were common and they always seemed to have mustard on them (I hated mustard to the point where just the smell would make me almost want to puke). Pain on the other hand is normal for me (I have epilepsy so after a seizure I'm always in some level of pain). So I would choose getting punched.
1240,2020-05-02 23:45:20,gcd5pz,"Eggs, I have them I just don't eat them, I won't eat lunch"
1241,2020-05-03 00:09:18,gcd5pz,It doesn’t mention which Dwayne Johnson! It could be weird Karen’s new kid from the trailer park because she named him after her favourite big guy!!!! So I chose Dwayne for that reason...
1242,2020-05-03 01:00:56,gcd5pz,"Get punched by Dwayne. It didn't say how much force was in the punch, so it could be a super light punch."
1243,2020-05-03 02:18:42,gcd5pz,Who needs lunch
1244,2020-05-03 02:22:01,gcd5pz,Just skip lunch?
1245,2020-05-03 02:39:57,gcd5pz,I'll just skip lunch lol
1246,2020-05-03 05:26:10,gcd5pz,"You could just, not eat the eggs and skip lunch"
1247,2020-05-03 06:06:53,gcd5pz,Getting punched by Dwayne Johnson is my ticket to a free nose job! I’ll take it!
1248,2020-05-02 20:20:49,gcd5pz,"Food poisoning ain’t fun, so get punched in the face, I’ll be sure to land a punch on his face myself"
1249,2020-05-03 00:25:00,gcd5pz,I don’t each lunch anyways
1250,2020-05-03 00:59:21,gcd5pz,Never said how hard he'll hit or that I can't sue
1251,2020-05-03 01:30:42,gcd5pz,"How rotten are these eggs?
Edit: also how hard is the rock punching me?"
1252,2020-05-03 01:39:18,gcd5pz,Does the egg contain salmonella?
1253,2020-05-03 01:49:11,gcd5pz,"Eggs, I can skip lunch."
1254,2020-05-03 02:27:53,gcd5pz,How many eggs in a day. And how hard is the punch.
1255,2020-05-03 02:44:55,gcd5pz,Dwayne would most likely not go full force on a 13 y.o so yea
1256,2020-05-03 06:34:54,gcd5pz,I think he is too nice to hit you hard
1257,2020-05-03 06:42:55,gcd5pz,I’d just... not have lunch for a week.
1258,2020-05-03 07:07:38,gcd5pz,I have a low apetite sooo no lunch for a week.
1259,2020-05-03 07:19:31,gcd5pz,"Eggs.

You're assuming I'm having lunch. I have cereal, and dinner later with snacks in between. Multiple, it's even so there's no definitive ""lunch"""
1260,2020-05-03 07:30:11,gcd5pz,I'd ask Dwayne to punch me lightly.
1261,2020-05-03 07:30:33,gcd5pz,"No one said you have to eat them, or that they're the only things you can eat."
1262,2020-05-03 08:00:50,gcd5pz,Me: Skips lunch by eating a large breakfast.
1263,2020-05-03 09:24:25,gcd5pz,"I never eat lunch anyways, just a lot of snacks"
1264,2020-05-03 10:36:07,gcd5pz,I'm quite sure The Rock would be kind enough not to destroy your face.
1265,2020-05-03 10:45:21,gcd5pz,Dwayne would probably just tap my chin very lightly in a jokey way.
1266,2020-05-02 23:41:24,gcd5pz,[deleted]
1267,2020-05-03 01:01:24,gcd5pz,It didn't say the force behind the punch tho...
1268,2020-05-03 03:08:29,gcd5pz,Also hes such a sweet human I doubt he would hit me that hard.
1269,2020-05-03 00:16:37,gcd5pz,If you got punched in the face full force by Mike Tyson you'd probably die
1270,2020-05-03 00:45:36,gcd5pz,"This is fair. Especially an unopposed, all out punch? You'd be a goner"
1271,2020-05-03 05:29:32,gcd5pz,"This!  The rock is huge and i'm sure it would be awful to feel his punch,  but Tyson,  amongst others,  spent decades perfecting everything about fisticuffs."
1272,2020-05-03 01:41:38,gcd5pz,"nah, man. full force or eggs. no point in being a tap"
1273,2020-05-03 00:52:34,gcd5pz,a light tap isnt a punch. its a light TAP
1274,2020-05-03 00:39:09,gcd5pz,That's exactly what I was thinking
1275,2020-05-03 00:55:51,gcd5pz,i thought it was obvious you couldn't ask for a light punch. that defeats the whole purpose
1276,2020-05-03 00:42:56,gcd5pz,"Then you’re not eating lunch, so not actually participating in the WYR."
1277,2020-05-02 23:31:44,gcd5pz,Didn't consider that. Ig u could always eat a big breakfast and early dinner + midnight snack and you're good
1278,2020-05-03 01:10:11,gcd5pz,"If I can choose this, this is what I'm picking. A punch from the rock might honestly kill me."
1279,2020-05-03 02:44:23,gcd5pz,Yea. And you could just have a bigger breakfast/dinner or both.
1280,2020-05-03 07:52:52,gcd5pz,"Now come to think of it, why not just eat 2 breakfasts and/or 2 dinners

Brunch is not Lunch"
1281,2020-05-03 08:32:56,gcd5pz,Yeah I'm surprised by people saying the punch. Assuming this is a full force punch this could very easily kill you or give you life changing injuries. It's far less likely the rotten eggs will actually cause death
1282,2020-05-03 05:56:01,gcd5pz,Yes.
1283,2020-05-03 01:20:44,gcd5pz,A fracture lasts a lot longer than a week.
1284,2020-05-03 07:56:10,gcd5pz,Happy Cake Day!

1286,2020-05-03 10:21:11,gcd5pz,Punch him back and what do you think he’ll do to you?
1287,2020-05-03 03:39:19,gcd5pz,"Even if a skinny stick were to punch you in the face full force, it would still do damage...

EDIT: A word"
1288,2020-05-03 01:16:50,gcd5pz,"Imagine being punched with a soft punch and then BAMNNN, ready for surgery you go. 2 punches from the rock? I'll frame any teeth I loose with it"
1289,2020-05-03 03:26:28,gcd5pz,probably? i'd take a bullet instead of mike's fist
1290,2020-05-03 01:43:32,gcd5pz,"Full force it is then. 

Rotten eggs just plain nasty."
1291,2020-05-03 05:18:27,gcd5pz,Full force = lawsuit. Would I rather eat rotten eggs or get punched and win a lot of momey for it? No questions bruv
1292,2020-05-03 01:01:13,gcd5pz,"Be ""gentle"", I understand ""not full power"". Not a good time but not a jawbreaker"
1293,2020-05-03 04:04:10,gcd5pz,"People always think they're so smart with their loopholes. I just hate it, the aim of the sub is to pick between two hard choices, and everything should be taken at face value. Seriously I can't put to words how much I hate loopholes people come up with in this sub. It's just against what this sub stands for imo."
1294,2020-05-03 03:27:18,gcd5pz,thank you. hate when people try to find loopholes in everything.

1297,2020-05-03 05:39:52,gcd5pz,Sorry dude. You can't file a lawsuit after 'YOU' asked to be punched in the face. It doesn't work that way.
1298,2020-05-03 04:07:39,gcd5pz,i got so fed up i posted a would you rather about it lol
1299,2020-05-03 07:29:14,gcd5pz,"It's up to you to write your description clearly, and explain the choices. Don't blame others for your lack of specificity. If you were made to choose between the two by some genie or something, of course you would go looking for loopholes."

1310,2020-05-04 17:23:48,gcd5pz,"What? Are you brain damaged? You realize that in martial arts tournaments/classes, you must sign a waiver stating you agree to fight in approved rings/matches, and that you waive all liability to the tournament organizers and other competitors for injuries, and so on? You can't get sued because you sign an official contract confirming that you do not hold other competitors liable for injuries. The organizers must also have proper filings with the state/county and have gotten approval for everything beforehand. This is HIGHLY different from me saying ""punch me"" to someone.

Source: Have competed and judged before in martial arts competitions, have helped organize several taekwondo and muay thai competitions with my schools."

1329,2020-05-02 19:53:21,gcc7u9,"Nysier Brooks is damn nice but I think Miami is still a bit high, their front court was especially awful last year"
1330,2020-05-02 22:07:24,gcc7u9,"I'm really starting to buy Florida State as the best team in the conference. MJ Walker is an absolute stud. I think he's capable of running the show. Because FSU was so deep last year, this year they have a bunch of guys that can step up. Remember Devin Vassell wasn't even on people's radar before this season. You obviously have Scottie Barnes and Sardaar Calhoun coming in. Then I think Raiquan Gray, Anthony Polite and Malik Osbourne can really step up."
1331,2020-05-03 21:35:56,gcc7u9,I’m ready to not be horrendous on offense again.  If we have to drop to #5 defense I’ll take it.
1332,2020-05-02 19:53:34,gcc7u9,"NCSU def a little higher.  Sure we lost the best recruit but the guys we have coming in are wicked good.  Not to mention how well Fundy, Devon, and Manny played this past year."
1333,2020-05-02 20:58:38,gcc7u9,I'd argue that this will be a much more classic Duke team than recent years. Definitely more shooting than we've had in a long time and no dominant big man.
1334,2020-05-03 05:24:17,gcc7u9,"I don’t think Duke will be fantastic, but I do think they’ll be better than last year."
1335,2020-05-02 20:10:41,gcc7u9,Just gotta tell myself it’s going to be worth it
1336,2020-05-03 01:13:15,gcc7u9,"Glad VT didn't end up in Wake Forest tier. We're still a fairly young team though the grad transfers are a huge addition. Plus getting a little bit of size so we aren't playing 6'6"" guys at the 5 will help.

Really hoping Ojiako has some major improvements between his freshman and sophomore years."
1337,2020-05-02 19:56:05,gcc7u9,I would move FSU to Tier 1. Any of those 4 could win the conference or the national championship

They return a ton of production, and Hughes’s ball-dominance isn’t going to be missed if Girard makes the step he should make"
1342,2020-05-04 03:46:57,gcc7u9,"It wouldn't be an ACC preseason ranking without FSU being disrespected.

Also neglected to mention the return of Huff for UVA"
1343,2020-05-03 02:51:14,gcc7u9,"Not arguing with your placement of us, but some of the facts are a little off.  Sam Williamson is equally as much of a ""fast rising sophomore"" as DJ.  Sam played the most minutes out of the freshman by a decent margin and he performed very well in his role.  Both Sam and DJ will be massive contributors next year.  Secondly, Malik Williams has been in a ""feature role"" for the last 2 season now.  He's a hell of a player and has already shown his worth.  Our team has the potential to be top 5 in the ACC next year, but how we earn our points will look a lot different.  The '19-'20 team was chocked full of shooters, but lacked slashers or guys that could beat you off of the dribble.  Next years team is pretty much the opposite of that.  We have a lot of slashers (DJ, Williamson, Jones, and Minlend) who excel in beating guys off the dribble and getting to the rim.  Our 3pt shooting will take a big dip but our points in the paint and free throw attempts should go up a bunch.  Our defense should improve too due to having more athletes on the floor."
1344,2020-05-02 20:49:55,gcc7u9,"Two main thoughts- one, I'd say you've significantly overrated Notre Dame, and underrated State by a similar margin.

Second... I'll believe Georgia Tech is a contender for a top-half finish with their roster when I see it. Frankly, I'm not sure that's possible unless the ACC is stupendously terrible again."
1345,2020-05-02 19:27:33,gcc7u9,11th??? Absolutely not.
1346,2020-05-02 19:50:35,gcc7u9,"UNC should be \#1. The frontcourt advantage will be too monstrous. Best returning player. Best recruiting class - you could argue Duke but ours is more balanced imo. The rebounding and post scoring is just going to bury teams.

As for everyone who says ""but what about shooting"", UNC has had great seasons before with amazing bigs and limited 3 point shooting. In 2016 they went to the championship game, had the #1 offense on Kenpom, and shot 32.7% from 3 on the year."
1347,2020-05-02 19:54:02,gcc7u9,Haha whoops better add Syracuse. Please just keep in mind that all the teams you mention are in the same tier. So I agree with you that the teams at the top of the tier are too high and the bottom are too low.
1348,2020-05-02 22:08:47,gcc7u9,"Rofl, gotta start with fielding a team first.   We know what that’s like actually."
1349,2020-05-02 19:58:43,gcc7u9,"Yeah I think Brooks takes care of that problem entirely. Laranaga has the backcourt, as long as he can get defense/rebounding from his bigs."
1350,2020-05-02 23:52:14,gcc7u9,I think FSU is for sure being underrated but I think UVA looks the best on paper.  Hauser should add some much needed offense plus their recruiting class was solid.
1351,2020-05-03 17:48:10,gcc7u9,"Agreed. To answer OP's statement about PG, we played the following guys at the point last year who return: upcoming RS JR Anthony Polite, RS JR Raiquan Gray, and SR RayQuan Evans. Those three plus Barnes will provide a solid rotation for PG where we will see separation by January. Minutes will tighten by then.

MJ is a great secondary ball handler but really thrives at 3 and D with driving inside added to his toolkit this last year."
1352,2020-05-03 22:28:28,gcc7u9,"That's kinda my thought, you'll be back in the Top 25 on offense and drop to 5-10 on D"
1353,2020-05-02 20:20:01,gcc7u9,"Sure, Moore and Hayes are good. Are they good enough to replace Johnson in year 1? I doubt it. I don't think there is anybody to replace CJ Bryce. Harris is more like Daniels and seabron is probably a year away. I agree a little low here, but somebody has to be #11. Are you really that confident NC State will be better than ND, GT, Va Tech and Clemson? I think they could easily be better than a couple of those teams...I just wouldn't predict it."
1354,2020-05-02 20:04:12,gcc7u9,"Yeah they're still a top 10 class right? Or did that change after the loss? Either way, it's still a good class."
1355,2020-05-02 21:00:44,gcc7u9,"Moore and Johnson aren't shooters, I doubt Roach is much of a shooter as a freshman either."
1356,2020-05-03 07:28:57,gcc7u9,Last year's Duke team was #5 on Kenpom. 25-6. Zero percent chance this years Duke team is top 5 on Kenpom. They dont have 2 stars like Jones and Carey to carry load. They'll score by committee.
1357,2020-05-03 21:31:54,gcc7u9,"I'm interested to see what happens with Tyrece Radford, typically freshman stats like his would indicate future star potential but his role will be different from here on out."
1358,2020-05-02 20:21:54,gcc7u9,"They lost their 3 best players, don't have the traditional defensive presence at the 5, and are starting a 6'8 freshman combo forward at the point. I think I'm being generous to rank them at the top of tier 2."
1359,2020-05-03 06:18:46,gcc7u9,"It blows my mind everytime. There’s no reason y’all should be ranked in tier 2, or imo below UNC."
1360,2020-05-02 23:04:25,gcc7u9,"Yeah he should be decent, but your next guard is an unranked freshman. To me that is the problem. But you guys should be better than last year, I just don’t know who else to put at 13. Like I’ve said repeatedly, whoever i put at 7-9 is going to be overrated and 12-14 will be underrated. To me all these teams are bubble teams."
1361,2020-05-02 21:49:56,gcc7u9,"I don’t know how much of a step there is for Girard to make. He’ll always be tasked with too much as long as he’s the primary ballhandler. There just isn’t much talent on the roster if griffin has to sit. And again, tiers. How do you rank em within the 3rd tier?"
1362,2020-05-04 03:48:31,gcc7u9,This is such an insane take. Kinda like the folks who demanded Virginia and Texas tech be top 10 teams this year.
1363,2020-05-03 07:26:09,gcc7u9,"Dude you realize we were 5TH in ACC last year and return every single player besides Banks who was inconsistent on offense all year.

Both Alvarado and Devoe will be All Conference players and Moses Wright has chance too. Find me an ACC team that returns 3 players with their kind of production. We're a sleeper top 25 team this year."
1364,2020-05-04 15:33:59,gcc7u9,Dude isn’t very good at analyzing teams beyond recruit rankings and departures. But muh Kenpom!
1365,2020-05-02 19:59:25,gcc7u9,"Could we finish first? Definitely. Should we be pegged first preseason? No. Too many questions. I have seen us around the 6 seed range in many mock brackets and that doesn’t translate to winning the ACC. 

This should be a better team. Anywhere from battling for a one seed to playing in Dayton. We will see how it plays out."
1366,2020-05-02 21:04:12,gcc7u9,"Sure, if Leaky Black turns into Justin Jackson and Anthony Harris becomes Marcus Paige then Carolina could be the best team in the country. That 2016 team was a lot more than just Brice Johnson, even if they couldn't shoot very well."
1367,2020-05-02 21:02:36,gcc7u9,You would be the one I'd expect to be delusional about next year after a 14-19 record. Can always look for ClaireBear's posts lmao
1368,2020-05-02 21:18:37,gcc7u9,"You just finished at the bottom of the conference, lost the only guy on your team with a pulse to the draft, and expect to be pegged #1 preseason in the ACC with a weaker recruiting class than Duke? Lol. 

Roy’s reputation with freshman isn’t the best either. It’s not bad, but it isn’t Coach K level. Roy thrives and is elite when he has senior leadership, especially in the frontcourt."

1370,2020-05-04 01:01:27,gcc7u9,"True. The assumption now is that everyone on our roster stays except chaundee and probably sarr, which is fine by me. I’m betting we win more games than last season at least"
1371,2020-05-02 20:04:23,gcc7u9,They need like 3 bigs. None of them were anywhere near good enough last year
1372,2020-05-03 21:26:38,gcc7u9,"Trent Forrest played 31 mpg, so your other 3 PG candidates would be considered unproven at best. Polite and Gray had more TO's than assists, so Evans appears to be the only even remotely realistic candidate. 

Not saying it can't work out, but I think it is a question mark headed into the season. Not enough for me to really drop them like I would most teams without a PG as Hamilton knows what he is doing, but staying in tier 1 is tough."
1373,2020-05-02 21:20:34,gcc7u9,"Well, our recruiting class is still better than all of those schools, so the ones we beat this past year (Clemson, ND) I think absolutely.  We probably *should have* beat the others as well.  

As for replacing CJ and Markell, sure it hurts but both those players got absolutely carried by Funderburk and Daniels some games.  I think it's without a doubt still a net improvement that should at least warrant a couple spots earlier."
1374,2020-05-02 20:31:47,gcc7u9,"It’s a different play style than last year. Keatts is transitioning to a full court press, fast break offense. The personnel better fits his vision regardless of actual talent. Plus Markell’s hero ball hurt us just as much as it helped. CJ Bryce went multiple games scoreless this year and both him and Markell saw severe regression this season compared to their Junior years. Also there is no tier 3"
1375,2020-05-03 02:05:42,gcc7u9,Markell really didn’t have a great year for us last year. Super inconsistent and his shooting was way down
1376,2020-05-03 13:42:20,gcc7u9,"We aren't expecting Moore or Hayes to try and replace Markell, honestly not expecting either of those guys to start.  

We had Thomas Allen and Dereon Seabron redshirting last year and they should be 2 options to replace Markell.    

Hall wasnt even expected to start next year barring him just coming in and being amazing.  Keatts values experience and we bring back 5 players who contributed last year and 2 more redshirts who have gotten great reviews from practicing with the team.  

We aren't a top 4 or 5 ACC team but 11 is too low, esp if any of our new guys splash and can contribute as FR."
1377,2020-05-02 21:27:31,gcc7u9,"Unfortunately got bumped to 21, but what that does not reflect is the eligibility of Thomas Allen and Dereon Seabron which will be huge for us."
1378,2020-05-03 05:25:52,gcc7u9,"Tre Jones wasn’t a shooter until he came back for his sophomore year. I think you’re underselling how big of a jump 5* recruits can see between their freshman and sophomore years, and if one of Hurt or Moore make that jump it’s a pretty darned good team."
1379,2020-05-02 21:13:55,gcc7u9,"Yeah Moore and Johnson won't shoot much, although I'd expect Moore will shoot better than last year. But disagree on Roach, and having both Steward + Baker off the bench should give us more shooting than we've had recently, which is a low bar."
1380,2020-05-04 09:22:30,gcc7u9,"Roach is a much better shooter than he gets credit for, got a nice quick release. Def better than freshman Tre.

Baker, Hurt, and DJ all have straight up sniper potential, it’s just about consistency"
1381,2020-05-03 15:04:51,gcc7u9,"Yeah, computer models loved Duke this year. I think a lot of it was because Kansas played so terribly in the first game of the season, and we caught Michigan State reeling. 

“Zero percent chance” this year’s team is top-5? That seems brash. Tre jones was an elite defender and passer that couldn’t shoot to save his life before he came back to school. There’s a nonzero chance Hurt or Moore (or both) are ready to make a similar leap. 

Jalen Johnson is 247’s 8th best prospect; Vernon Carey was their 6th. Maybe it’s unfair to say we can expect similar results from Jalen, but it’s equally as unfair to say “Vernon Carey was a star and Jalen Johnson won’t be.” 

The fact that Duke is more balanced has me excited as hell. Last year if Tre was struggling or if Vernon couldn’t hit a bucket, they’d be in a skin-tight game against a mediocre-or-worse opponent because there was absolutely no 3rd option (unless it was one of the 50% of the games where Stanley played well)."
1382,2020-05-04 02:09:13,gcc7u9,tyrece was able to do some incredible things for being so young and small. I hope he doesn't lose any play time next year - I really enjoy watching him play.

1384,2020-05-02 22:00:28,gcc7u9,"Ooh I disagree on Girard. His usage+efficiency as a freshman is very impressive to me and if he makes a slight jump in his handle or creation for others he’s an all conference guard. I feel good about Girard+Boeheim+Guerrier+Dolezaj+Sidibe/Edwards being in the top 7 of starting 5’s in the conference. Guerrier needs to make a jump, but he’s super toolsy and flashed as a 3&D guy last year. They need one or two of the freshman to turn into useful bench pieces, but I don’t think that’s a crazy thing to expect."

1386,2020-05-03 21:33:14,gcc7u9,"One of the reasons I agree is how well you guys played once Alvarado was healthy and Usher became eligible.

Bubba could turn it on at any moment as well."

I understand people are shell shocked after last year, but it was pretty obvious from the start that last years team wasn't very good; two desperation grad transfers says it all. The ceiling was a decent NCAA tournament team. 

For the first time since 2017, UNC will have talent and depth at the post position. This is Roy's wheelhouse. And I look around the ACC and I don't see many teams with big men who can compete."
1389,2020-05-02 21:41:42,gcc7u9,"> Sure, if Leaky Black turns into Justin Jackson

Justin Jackson shot 29% from 3 his soph season. Obviously he was gifted offensively in other ways, but he wasn't a long range bomber that season. 

Besides, we don't need Justin Jackson or Marcus Paige to be the best team in the ACC. The conference and college basketball as a whole gets worse every single season. We just have to be better than our competition.

I think UNC will be the best ACC team next year, but I'll make no promises about winning the ACC. I haven't looked at the schedule yet."
1390,2020-05-02 21:43:05,gcc7u9,"When you go 14-19, losing most of the players and getting a bunch of freshman is a good thing, not a bad thing."

Losing Cole will be addition by subtraction. Chemistry was a major issue with him. Garrison was clearly a better player last year."
1393,2020-05-02 22:51:16,gcc7u9,Just my suggestion. I just wouldn’t argue much if somebody wanted to rearrange within the tiers. There’s only so much a person can predict.
1394,2020-05-02 20:17:15,gcc7u9,"Looking at previous JL teams, I don't think they need 3 bigs. They definitely could use another one, but going small is also an option."
1395,2020-05-02 21:24:32,gcc7u9,"You guys were 50 in KenPom, ND was 57, Clemson was 72. I really don't see a huge difference as far as incoming classes if you include transfers. You and Clemson both have a Top 100 recruit. ND has the best transfer.

I think all 3 teams are very similar. One of my issues with NC State is the fit of the recruits. Daniels, Beverly and Allen overlap quite a bit, if you play 2 of the 3 it is a major defensive issue. Funderburk and Bates are both pretty good, but is Keatts really going to play them together? If not, you are missing a PF. 

Meanwhile, Clemson gets just what the doctor ordered in Hall, while Notre Dame is primed to improve internally big time with at least two and potentially 3 new perimeter contributors if Wertz gets a waiver."
1396,2020-05-02 20:33:14,gcc7u9,I mean that might be the case but let’s see how it goes with the new system. I think it is a big stretch to think that the freshmen/transfers will replace established seniors without a hitch.

1402,2020-05-03 00:10:37,gcc7u9,"Quincy Guerrier certainly did NOT flash as a 3&D guy last year. He made 3 of 25 from deep and did not attempt one for all of February.

That being said I generally agree with you. 'Cuse success probably hinges on Griffin's eligibility, Kadary Richmond's readiness, and Girard's improvement (especially on defense). If any two of those things happen, it's likely another ""sweat out the bubble but make it in"" year, otherwise single digit conference wins."

Daniels and Beverly have completely different play styles.

Beverly isn’t that good of a defender and I don’t know about Allen, but Daniels was arguably our best on-ball defender last year, so I don’t know how you arrived at that conclusion. 

>is Keatts really going to play them together?  

Possibly. He definitely utilized them together plenty of times last year.

Are you sure you know as much about our team as you think?"

You also have a good recruiting class, but has UVA under Tony Bennett ever had an impact freshman? How good your incoming class is essentially irrelevant."
1412,2020-05-03 21:14:02,gcc7u9,"I make no comment about Daniels' defensive ability, I'm only talking about positional fit. Your backcourt ends up quite small with a freshman PG, another PG-sized defender at the 2, and Daniels guarding the 3. Seabron looks like he could help but that is far from assured, and maybe if Funderburk moves to full time 4, Hellems can defend the 3. But that completely changes what Keatts has done up to this point...

As for Funderburk and Bates, they played about 5 mpg next to each other last year. So maybe you should question how much you know about your team?"
1413,2020-05-03 23:39:39,gcc7u9,"Those seniors were the focus of opposing defenses. It is possible that a freshman vastly exceeds their ranking, but that's generally not how it works. I think Shakeel Moore is big time underrated, but he's not going to be better than Markel Johnson in year one."
1414,2020-05-03 02:00:03,gcc7u9,"Kyle Guy and London Perrantes were impact freshman for us. Tony Bennett only gives freshman major minutes if they’re guards. This class coming in is guard heavy. Beekman will be huge for us in that he will be able to give Kihei a ton of rest time and JAR is expected to receive a starting spot at some point next season much like Perrantes did his first year. 

We also have Hauser coming in as well as Shedrick who just redshirted. This team will have a lot of new bodies whose main strengths are on the offensive rather than defensive end.

Expect a return to small ball UVA much like the championship season"
1415,2020-05-03 12:02:22,gcc7u9,"Curious what ""not sold"" on UVA means for you. Second place like last year?"
1416,2020-05-03 21:37:45,gcc7u9,Has Tony Bennett ever started 2 players who shot 30% from the floor on the same team? Maybe that's the question you should be asking?
1417,2020-05-03 23:41:05,gcc7u9,"And redshirts, and you don’t even mention Devon Daniels who is IMO going to be the best offensive player we will have."
1418,2020-05-03 02:07:29,gcc7u9,"You talk a lot about your incoming class, but Bennett redshirts people like 50% of the time. 

Shedrick is Jay Huff 2.0. I expect him to start impacting the ACC around 2023.

Hauser will be a good scorer for sure. He's proven. I wonder if his defense will keep him off the floor though.

1419,2020-05-03 15:14:56,gcc7u9,"The floor for every UVA team under Bennett is so high.

I'd say UVA was around the ~30th best team in the nation last year. The qualifies as ""not sold"". A decent team, nothing more."
1421,2020-05-03 23:43:36,gcc7u9,"I'm not mentioning all players. I agree Daniels should be very good, but that isn't the issue here. 

Is he good enough where I can confidently state he'll be the best player on a solid at-large ACC squad? I'm not convinced of it just yet. And even that isn't the real issue, the real issue is whether I'm more convinced on Daniels/NC St vs the other 6-7 teams that are very evenly matched."
1422,2020-05-03 04:07:18,gcc7u9,">but Bennett redshirts people like 50% of the time 

Source on that? Are you suggesting out of Beekman, Mccorkle, JAR, and Trey Murphy, two of them will redshirt? Because that would be news to us hoos

The only other class that had 50% of the people redshirt was the class with Huff, Jerome, Hunter, and Guy. No one redshirted in the 2017 class, only one person out of 4 redshirted the 2018 class (Caffaro, due to injury), and only 2 out of 5 redshirted in the 2019 class (shedrick was one, the other was Hauser who had to sit due to transfer rules). 

> Shedrick is Jay Huff 2.0. I expect him to start impacting the ACC around 2023.

True shedrick will not be a starter and may be phased out of the lineup altogether by ACC play. No idea how he will have developed. But all I know is that in the frontcourt, the only proven commodities we have right now are Hauser and Huff. Whether it’s Caffaro or Shedrick who take the rest of the minutes is up in the air

> So what lottery talent will be playing the 4 like Hunter did?

No lottery talent. Hunter wasn’t a lottery pick in the 2017-2018 season, was he? But I do expect JAR to play Hunter’s role."

Spanish is my mother tongue but I speak and think in English for the most part."
1508,2020-05-02 09:09:30,gc0ex5,"As a Spanish speaker they will both be just as easy to read, while Occ is easier to use actively. One of the main differences is that Occ uses de Wahl's Rule and the supine for a lot of verbs to bring the number of irregular forms to six:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Wahl%27s_rule

There are about 80 verbs (and more if you include related verbs) that traditionally use irregular forms to derive nouns like this for example:

https://www.interlingua.com/ied/cerca/?edit%5Bkeys%5D=Select&op=Cerca

In Occidental the verb is selecter (not seliger) in order to derive selection and all the rest. Other examples are traducter (not traducer) to form traduction, acter (not ager) to form action.

The main difference if you were to sum it up is that Interlingua is made up of the common ancestors found in its source languages, while Occidental aims to natively derive international or internationalesque words using its internal rules."
1509,2020-05-02 09:19:39,gc0ex5,"That’s such a nice explanation, thanks. Why do you use Occidental?

I’ve always been interested in learning a “common” language so I learned English, but I still feel that I need to learn more. I wish there was more interest/initiative in teaching a global language."
1510,2020-05-02 09:59:24,gc0ex5,"It took about ten years to find it, actually, after trying out quite a few others (began with Ido). After Ido I became really infatuated with Interlingua but moved on to others, and at the time the magazine Cosmoglotta wasn't available online so Occidental didn't really register on the radar. But later on after Cosmoglotta got scanned I saw that it was what I had hoped Interlingua would be in 2005 when I first found out about it - something easy to read at first sight and natural appearance but with just enough autonomy that it isn't beholden to any source languages. Right now it's growing again and I'm mostly curious to see what will happen when it truly starts to live again. (At present there are probably about 200 to 300 people who know it but hard to estimate) One fortunate thing is that English hegemony doesn't seem to mean language death as a lot of languages (both natural and constructed) have come back to life in recent decades including ones like Manx that were completely gone.

**Feedback Logging (*Does not apply to GIVEAWAYS*)**

* Once a trade has been completed, one user (doesn't matter if OP or not) must create a comment (can be in-line with the trade discussion) tagging both [u/DCTbot](https://www.reddit.com/u/DCTbot) and the user they transacted with, for example u\/nathangibbs.
 * The u/ is required, and the username for the bot ***MUST BE TYPED NOT COPY/PASTED*** to work properly.
* Once this is done, the tagged user must respond to that comment for feedback to be logged.
* If successful, the bot will respond to the second comment with ""Added"", and the number will increment for both.

All discussions/negotiations about a potential trade must be made via comments. Exchange codes via PM or Reddit Chat. This helps to prevent scams and track trusted traders. **DO NOT RESPOND TO OFFERS MADE VIA PM OR CHAT.**

1776,2020-06-29 22:31:28,hi6fs6,"Boys, we’ve found  the reddit account/burner of either Isaiah Thomas (Boston) or Demar Derozan"
1777,2020-06-29 19:26:31,hi6fs6,Great list!!! Almost identical to my own
1778,2020-06-29 19:17:29,hi6fs6,They call him Demar DePression for a reason.
1779,2020-06-29 19:17:11,hi6fs6,ok kyrieforpresident
1780,2020-06-29 19:19:02,hi6fs6,He’s a masterbaitor
1781,2020-06-29 19:19:05,hi6fs6,It wasn’t Derozen or Dwight making it?
1782,2020-06-29 19:19:34,hi6fs6,It’s not bait that’s my opinion. He had one of the greatest seasons of all time in 16-17 and it’s been completely swept under the rug due to what’s happened since
1783,2020-06-29 20:34:44,hi6fs6,"Nope, it’s not"
1784,2020-06-29 19:15:52,hi6fs6,No not really. I’m just not afraid to differentiate from the norm
1785,2020-06-29 19:47:53,hi6fs6,Yes
1786,2020-06-29 19:58:05,hi6fs6,Why are you going through my history lol that’s kinda weird
1787,2020-06-29 19:19:57,hi6fs6,You clearly didn't because you typed this after you saw it.
1788,2020-06-29 19:26:26,hi6fs6,2024 book it 👁
1789,2020-06-29 19:20:33,hi6fs6,Oh there was plenty more I just loved that bit coupled with the fact they don't have Zeke Thomas on the list.
1790,2020-06-29 19:22:38,hi6fs6,Okay yes he had one great season ill give you that (one of the greatest of all time is a stretch) but how is he better than Steve Nash? That's without getting any the other logical absurdities in this list.
1791,2020-06-29 19:16:55,hi6fs6,"> I’m just not afraid to differentiate from the norm

That's a really eloquent way of saying, I'm a dumbass and have dumb opinions."
1792,2020-06-29 19:16:49,hi6fs6,Explain how Isaiah Thomas is better than Steve Nash
1793,2020-06-29 19:28:47,hi6fs6,"Thats fine, but some of these things you are saying I can't think of any half-decent evidence to back it up. Like some things are debatable or controversial like saying Westbrook ahead of Stockton, but then some things are just plain and simple stupid like Demar ahead of Garnett and Giannis."
1794,2020-06-29 19:48:39,hi6fs6,Cmon bro.
1795,2020-06-29 19:22:46,hi6fs6,Hahaha right? People forget just how good that dude was
1796,2020-06-29 19:23:25,hi6fs6,Nash didn’t score
1797,2020-06-29 19:25:12,hi6fs6,You know you have won a debate when your opponent insults your character and is unable to rebut any of your points
1798,2020-06-29 19:19:34,hi6fs6,"How about Demar fucking Derozan and Derrick Rose being higher than KG, Barkley, and Malone?

How about Steph being #2? 

How about Carmelo Anthony being one spot higher than Tim Duncan? 

How about Kevin Love being higher than Scottie Pippen? 

How about Manu Ginobli over Iverson? 

How about Kyrie being #15 in general?"
1799,2020-06-29 19:22:08,hi6fs6,"Steve Nash was a great player but he could never really score. In my opinion, while he was a great player and is worthy of this list, he didn’t deserve either of his mvps. Isaiah Thomas on the other hand had one of the greatest scoring seasons of all time and should have won mvp that year"
1800,2020-06-29 19:32:37,hi6fs6,"DeMar is by far the most disrespected player of this generation. He has had no help in Toronto and San Antonio. He put the Raptors on his back and carried them to the ECF. The only reason he could never win was because of LeBron greatness. Last year he dragged an even worse San Antonio squad into the playoffs and almost single handedly pulled off the upset against Denver. In my opinion, this puts him over Garnett who had a much better supporting cast in Boston."
1801,2020-06-29 19:49:47,hi6fs6,You shouldn’t have any problems with this as a Westbrook fan
1802,2020-06-29 19:25:38,hi6fs6,Is that the only criteria of the list? Also Nash definitely could score he often just sacrificed his onw ppg to set up others and to maximise his efficiency.
1803,2020-06-29 19:27:22,hi6fs6,Dude this entire thread is people refuting your points lol.
1804,2020-06-29 19:21:36,hi6fs6,"That's just the tip of the iceberg, there are so many more stupidities like WB 8th all time"
1805,2020-06-29 19:25:15,hi6fs6,Why are you doing this to yourself lol
1806,2020-06-30 04:39:57,hi6fs6,"KG also carried a terrible Minny team to the WCF which is further than Demar made it. Also a former MVP, 4x all nba, defense player of the year, and champion. What makes you think demar is better than him?"
1807,2020-06-29 19:39:14,hi6fs6,"Demar had great supporting cast. He had Kyle Lowry and the Raptors always had the best depth in the NBA. Yet he would consistently choke in the playoffs. Then in San Antonio, the previous season the Spurs without Demar (Kawhi was hurt the whole season) made the 7 seed, Demar comes in the next year, they improve by only one win and are still the 7 seed. KG is a top 10 defender in NBA history, he is a better shooter rebounder, finisher than Demar. He has an NBA championship. Boston wasn't the only place he played, he tokes some pretty trash TWolves teams far. KG is by far better."
1808,2020-06-29 19:50:12,hi6fs6,I do cuz I’m not bias lol. Westbrook is no where near 8
1809,2020-06-29 19:27:13,hi6fs6,Honestly seriously debated putting stoudemire in over him. It was close for sure
1810,2020-06-29 19:27:46,hi6fs6,I have yet to see you debate me
1811,2020-06-29 19:23:25,hi6fs6,"I mean it's top to bottom bad lol. 

I just keep uncovering absurdities and laughing my ass off. 

Like I just saw John Stockon at #46, and I'm rolling."
1812,2020-06-29 19:31:30,hi6fs6,Nash basically made Amare the player he was. You are entitled to your opinion mate we will just agree to disagree on so many things with this list.
1813,2020-06-29 19:32:11,hi6fs6,"Because there's no point. Where would that get me? You're obviously a clown that's either doing some galaxy-brain level trolling, or an actual moron who put forth the worst all-time list I think I've seen on this sub. 

Allow me to extend an olive branch. I'll just look at the bottom of your list. You have Steve Nash and Reggie Miller ranked below Boogie Cousins and CJ McCollum. This is an objectively bad opinion. Now take that same bad opinion, and apply it to the rest of the list. That's what I'm looking at."
1814,2020-06-29 19:33:25,hi6fs6,Ok fair enough glad you could respect my opinion
1815,2020-06-29 19:38:17,hi6fs6,"I’ll debate you on Cousins. Up until the Achilles injury derailed his career, he was one of the most dominant centers of all time. He was by far the best center in the league. He put up god like numbers but was constantly hampered by a lack of a supporting cast. Miller is one of the most overrated players of all time. No defense and is only on this list because he revolutionized the 3. Nash couldn’t score and didn’t deserve either of his mvps but is still one of the greats."

For real though, no-one cared that there were practically no white people in Black panther, because there were no need for them in there, but only black people doesn't mean it's diverse, it means there were many black people, if you make a movie about Vikings, it only makes sense that they're all white people"

In italy we have ""quote rosa"" (pink quotes). Basically it means ""it has to be at least a certain percentage of women in public offices"".
In my opinion it is so sexist to do that cause you can possibly reject a men, that could be more qualified for a certain job, cause the law oblige you to hire a woman only because she's a woman.

Ex: During the CoVid emergency the government has formed some ""emergency groups"" that had to work on things like economy, law, prison system, public services such as hospitals or clinics, ecc... And somebody started to complain about the fact there were a very little number of women in those groups, and then the government had to hire some women only because they're women."

But that shouldn't stop you from fighting for representation of your race in the media. The reason why black people have progressed so well is because of their ability to demand representation and progress. You don't see that on a large scale with other minorities. Besides, the media portrays mixed people more often than they do black people. Particularly with women. Idc what you think, but mixed will never be black just like it will never be white. Speaking of mixed, the Rock is half Samoan, which is polynesian, if I'm not mistaken. And he even had that half of his culture represented at the 2019 MTV awards. If you want more people of your ethnic background represented in mainstream media, you have to fight for it."

If you acknowledge that women have been rejected to have their roles fulfilled by lesser qualified men, then you'll realized that one is more likely to optimize his chances of recruiting the highest quality staff with a law like the one you explained.

You can see the reasoning behind why so many more Asians are racist against blacks, they most likely were raised to act on complete opposite ends of the spectrum."

I'm not saying I'd want a celeb president to have a celeb president, I'm saying there might be celebs out there who'd actually have what it takes to be a good president and they might run thinking their name recognition and appearance of being saner than Trump would make it an easy victory"

How would you say my mains do against this boss? King Knight certainly hits hard and Hyness can just stall over everything by spamming projectiles midair, but I'm not very sure about Zomboss."
1970,2020-06-29 13:20:00,hhr2fg,"I have a question: Any tips for beating the Witherstorm, Cackletta,  or Count Dooku?"
1971,2020-06-29 02:16:47,hhr2fg,"King Knight is at a disadvantage during the first part, but he's really good against GDK, because his Kneel move can obliterate the Waluigites with ease.

Dr. Zomboss depends on how you use him, frankly. While you can take out the first phase with buckethead spam, you'll probably want to save your Zombie Energy so you can summon something bigger to tackle the final phase. I'd recommend using his physical attacks and maybe calling in one or two coneheads for assists, then use a Gargantuar in the final part."
1972,2020-06-29 18:29:18,hhr2fg,"Cackletta can only KO you with those dark portals she constantly throws across the floor. To compensate for this, the more damage you take against her, the heavier your character gets, to the point where you can't even jump at high percentage. However, you can turn this against her and kill her in one hit by spiking her into a portal as her bat form flies across the stage.

Count Dooku is a little trickier. His attacks aren't as impressive, but you won't get a lot of opportunities for attack unless you can figure out how to perfect parry his lightsaber strikes. His passive ability, ""Looking forward to this,"" let's him take half damage from frontal attacks, but attacks that hit him from behind like Spy's backstab or Crazy Dave's Bloomerang work wonders."
1973,2020-06-29 10:11:51,hhr2fg,"Thanks for the tips! Ain't nothing that feels as good as turning a David vs Goliath match on its head by bringing in your own Goliath. (Was also rather funny to watch all the Mini Waluigi get knocked off the screen simultaneously) 

I've been thinking of refighting the boss with Hyness just so that I can say I've beaten him with all my mains now that I have the timing on his moves down. I've been working on my Mage sister toss stall technique for this reason. It basically lets Hyness stay in the air forever if you want to.

Again, I'd love to see these become a regular thing, because this one is very creative."

1975,2020-06-29 18:46:44,hhr2fg,"Just use attacks that can steal items, like pickpocket or bungee zombie to grab blocks until you expose the command block. Then hit it until you win."

This is seen when she won’t let the boys copy her HW (most of the time), and when Hermione is mad when she thinks Harry put felix felicis into Ron’s drink for quidditch tryouts, etc.. Although if 1 is in her tritype like you say than maybe that could explain it. Cheers"

2030,2020-06-28 23:13:27,hhj0td,"""Through denying their feelings of fear to one extent or another, Sexual Sixes go against danger from a position of strength; therefore, they have a passion for searching for or securing a position of strength. And it's not just a strong character they seek, but the kind of strength that makes somebody else afraid-they want to assume a powerful enough to hold the enemy at a distance. These Sixes display a forcefulness that comes from no wanting to be weak, and they don't allow for weakness in themselves....""

"".....Sexual Sixes have a need not just for strength but for intimidation. As Naranjo suggests, this expression of intimidation is very much the essence of the character; if they appear strong, they won't be attacked. ....""

"".....Sexual Sixes give off the impression that they could get violent with anybody at any time, but that doesn’t mean that they have no fear. It is precisely out of a sense of fear that their anticipation of an attack comes-there is a somewhat paranoid imagining of danger, a belief that anyone can turn into a threat. However, these Sixes usually do not look afraid; their visible character could hardly be called ""fearful"" from the outside.

In contrast to the Self-Preservation Six, who backs away from threats, the couterphobic Sexual Six tends to move toward risky situations, feeling a sense of safety in actually confronting danger rather than hiding from it or avoiding it. They convince themselves (and others) that they are not victims of fear; they are convinced that fear is an emotion that should be eliminated systemically.....""

"".....The fact that these Sixes regularly move against danger (or perceived danger) can, at times, give them the appearance of a rebel, a daredevil, a risk taker, an adrenaline junkie, or a troublemaker. In some cases, Sexual Sixes may be prone to megalomania or having a ""hero complex."" In their own way, they seek to be ""good guys"" to avoid being punished. They may have the illusion that they are spontaneous, but they tend not to be.

Sexual Sixes tend to be very contrarian: they always have an argument at hand to refute and contradict an opinion. Instead of thinking in terms of ""best-case"" or ""worst-case"" scenarios, they think in terms of contrarian scenarios-if the trend is for others to focus on the worst, they will focus on the best; but if everyone is focusing on the best, they will assert the worst.....""

2035,2020-06-30 16:52:15,hhj0td,"yeah what you explained is what i think is the 1 in her tritype, which is her secondary type. what makes me believes she is a 3 is her worst fear when it came to the boggart was a failed test. to me, that just screams 3 bc hermione is way more focused on achievements, “we could have been killed, or worse, expelled” (i know it’s the exact right line, but you get the point). She also used the time turner to take more classes, which to me screams 3. She also breaks the rules a lot. i know it’s for the greater good a lot, but she breaks so many rules that a 1 would have a heart attack. That’s why I think she’s a 3 and not a 1. My sister is a sp 3w4, and we thought for a while she was a 1, and she is almost identical to hermione. That’s my two cents. Have a good day!"

What is mega frustrating is people acting like his narcissism and “megalomania” makes him an 8. It’s a lazy way to write someone off. The enneagram institute is really close on a lot of things and a great resource, but it’s super dangerous to type people, even your own friends, based on some blanket stereotypes. Understanding you’re a 6, I get that you’re leaning into the big group that’s a credible resource and I can dig you arguing an opinion. You’re a good questioner, question more on this one. Not going to debate “they said he was so he must be”."

2055,2020-06-29 11:42:55,hhj0td,"A lot of numbers are defiant. Both 6’s and 8’s can be this way specifically, from my observation he’s a little too irrationally aggressive. This is behavior not motivation."

Will Hunting is a counterphobic 6, you can see the difference between the two. Everything Will does is fear based, even when he gets unruly and abrasive. He fears getting hurt (his trauma definitely plays into that, and there's nothing to suggest that enneagram type isn't born from trauma)."

2067,2020-06-27 19:18:28,hgzgoi,So I've heard. But I feel like Netflix has some good resources to work with (their Marvel series were very good) and they will be able to do a better job with a series than trying to squeeze it into a film.
2068,2020-06-27 18:30:28,hgy1dz,"I'd love to see Clayface, he could be the games copycat character like what Mortal Kombat sometimes has, some of his special moves can include turning into a certain hero and using one of their moves, as well as have some of his own original moves."
2069,2020-06-27 18:15:23,hgy1dz,"Seems like a pretty realistic roster expectation, though I suspect NRS will throw a few curve balls at us like they have previously. I still think Cyborg has a really good chance as well due to him being a core member of the Justice League, though I’m not sure if he still has much focus after New 52"
2070,2020-06-27 18:30:33,hgy1dz,Hopefully they can add some premier skins that look like the movies/shows. They did it in the first Injustice.

2072,2020-06-27 20:58:36,hgy1dz,Well I'm still hoping ij3 will pull a smash ultimate and bring back every character from thr first two and add some amazing new ones like beast boy and maybe some arrowverse ones

2076,2020-06-27 19:50:02,hgy1dz,"I think this is good. Changes I'd make, just to cut down on the roster so others can fit in: Dick and Damian can share a slot like they did in ij1, and while I would want Lois in the story, I don't really want her fighting. Also, I don't want Penguin as playable, but that might just be me. This'll free some spots that I think are truly necessary if we're doing a Blackest Night story. With 3 open slots, we can add 3 Lanterns to bring us to 5 total including Hal and Black Hand. These 3 would be Sinestro and Atrocitus returning, and either Saint Walker or Carol Ferris/Star Sapphire. I personally prefer Walker, but it's always nice to have a little bit more female representation.

While I'm here, I'd like to request a few Premiere skins: Wally's Rebirth getup for the Flash, Roy Harper for Ollie, Garth for Aquaman, and Donna for Wonder Woman because I love the Titans. Also, I want a Green and Black Lantern version of all of the Earth lanterns, not just John.

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk"
2077,2020-06-27 20:19:25,hgy1dz,I just hope manta hellboy scarecrow and sub come back. I never really played the campaign but I did main them
2078,2020-06-27 20:49:52,hgy1dz,"Okay, so I expect we'll get Static (Milestone is getting a relaunch soon), as well as Booster Gold (he was one of the most requested characters for I2). Similarly, I think we can expect more GL related characters (like Sinestro and Atrocitus) if it is Blackest Night - so we realistically have options of Larfleeze, Saint Walker, Kyle Rayner, Carol Ferris as Star Sapphire, Indigo-1, Arkillo, Bleez, Munk, Kilowag, Guy Gardner, Ganthet, maybe Alan Scott, or Soranik Natu."
2079,2020-06-27 20:52:06,hgy1dz,"I think this is good, except I'm not really sure how they'd have Lois Lane as a character who can fight. That'd probably piss a lot of the fanbase off. If it is Blackest Night, then she could absolutely be worked into the story, but I don't see her as being a playable character without a lot of people getting mad. I'd rather have Nekron as a character you unlock by beating (a la Brainiac) in place of the slot you have for Lois."
2080,2020-06-27 21:39:06,hgy1dz,"This is the best wishlist I've seen, very realistic!"
2081,2020-06-27 21:54:33,hgy1dz,Hey don't forget they had concept art of Krypto also LOL! But in all seriousness I actually really dig this list. Definitely fits The Blackest night theme
2082,2020-06-27 19:08:22,hgy1dz,Dick Grayson is currently Dead man in Injustice so if he comes back I hope he would not be a black lantern and he would remain dead man [Deadman:Dick Grayson ](https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Richard_Grayson_%28Injustice%29).
2083,2020-06-27 20:57:30,hgy1dz,"What do you think about guest characters? (I.e. the MK characters, Hellboy, The Turtles)"
2084,2020-06-27 23:43:19,hgy1dz,Needs a grappler
2085,2020-06-28 01:03:00,hgy1dz,"I like that Idea. Though I would want it to be bigger. Like at the end of the campaign Nekron wins and zooms out to another multiverse, and then another and the final boss is a multiverse level threat like Imperiex or The Anti-Monitor. 

It would allow for characters to return through the Blackest night while also introducing different versions of the characters throughout the multiverse joining together to fight this threat. Like maybe one where Orion killed his father and runs Apocalypse like in Kingdom Come, or another where Dark Knights Metal happens. This would also allow for a DC version of aftermath with other multiverses to further extend the story if need be."
2086,2020-06-28 01:07:52,hgy1dz,"Agree for the most part, if it is a blackest night story, you NEED atrocitus."
2087,2020-06-28 03:06:44,hgy1dz,"I kind of want there to be a teen titans sub plot/story to newer game. We’ve had raven, cyborg in both games, Damien and Red hood, as well as nightwing in a sense, and starfire as dlc with red hood. Plus if they do bring in beast boy, that’s be the whole team. They could also do deathstroke/slade, but we’ll see"
2088,2020-06-28 21:12:48,hgy1dz,I hope there’s Orion.
2089,2020-06-28 21:13:35,hgy1dz,I would like Parallax as a Player character maybe using Kyle Rayner as a host.
2090,2020-06-29 03:03:05,hgy1dz,"You know what I hate to be a downer, but this is a good list and I would like for some of it to come true but I don't it, and one thing I have to ask why include hawkman but not hawkgirl when it would make sense for to include them both since they have a strong connection to each other. 

So this might be a likely list since it seems that DC wants the cast to be comprised of characters from movies, TV shows or characters that are having some major plot in the comics at the moment. 

The first 10 is no doubt gonna be these characters. 

1. Batman
2. Superman
3. Wonder woman
4. Aquaman
5. Flash
6. Green lantern 
7. Cyborg
8. Harley Quinn
9. Joker. 
10. Catwoman

These next characters are likely based off what is going on. 

1. Killer frost (based on what they where doing with flash.)
2. Batwoman (to try and promote her show)
3. huntess (birds of prey movie)
4. Black canary (birds of prey movie)
5. Elastic-girl/negative man(doom patrol)
6. Raven (Titans)
7. Nightwing (titans)
8. Red hood (Titans) 
9. Supergirl 
10. Green arrow 
11. Star girl and S.T.R.I.P.E.

And I can't possibly think of any other characters.
They are trying to promote, I mean poison ivy and king shark are actually likely as well since Harley Quinn TV show. And Batman who laughs is likely as well but be might be just a primer skin for joker."
2091,2020-06-29 09:30:53,hgy1dz,I think they should add Raven trigon because It would say what exactly happened to raven and the main villain could be trigon as if he got released from the void. How can he be released? By raven’s help. I’ve seen many fans including me wanting raven in the game.
2092,2020-07-01 05:32:32,hgy1dz,"With so many black lanterns, won’t the power set be extremely similar and make the roster somewhat boring"
2093,2020-06-27 18:09:39,hgy1dz,Didn’t read them because you put them in weird paragraph form. Just list them out
2094,2020-06-27 19:24:15,hgy1dz,Definitely!! He and/or The Parasite would be awesome! Though I think Clayface would be more like Shang Tsung and Parasite would be closer to Seth in Street Fighter V.
2095,2020-06-27 18:16:11,hgy1dz,I'd guess he still has some relevance just because of the Snyder Cut coming next year.
2096,2020-06-27 21:13:50,hgy1dz,"Cyborg is the least played character in both games, and I don’t think the injustice story requires him to be there."
2097,2020-06-27 18:35:30,hgy1dz,"I wasn't really a big fan of premier skins. They just felt like such a lazy way to add more characters who didn't even feel like fully fledged, independent characters."
2098,2020-06-27 19:03:35,hgy1dz,That's the idea. His body could still be reanimated.
2099,2020-06-27 22:07:38,hgy1dz,They’re not entirely going off the comics (IMO) that’s a good thing. Hopefully Dick comes back from a different earth or as Agent 37.
2100,2020-06-27 19:12:15,hgy1dz,"It has been reported several times. And in my opinion, it would make the most sense with how many important characters are dead in the Injustice universe with ties to currently living ones."
2101,2020-06-27 20:43:54,hgy1dz,"It's the prevailing fan theory, there's no real evidence outside of the sheer number of dead characters that are super popular."
2102,2020-06-27 21:00:17,hgy1dz,I hadn’t heard of it but I love the idea.  It’s a great way to bring up Superman’s actions as the heinous leader he’s been the past 2 games/comics. And it’ll kind of be like the revenants of MK11 which I find to be a really fun interaction with the mortal characters.
2103,2020-06-27 19:27:47,hgy1dz,"I can see Mera as DLC, but I think Orm would only be included if there is a focus on Atlantis. Like, if the story was about Orm leading a war against the surface world with his one group of villains and he would be the final boss."
2104,2020-06-27 20:54:34,hgy1dz,"guest characters tend to not return next game, so i doubt Sub and Hellboy will return."
2105,2020-06-27 21:27:13,hgy1dz,I think they’ll definitely include a GL villain to keep up the pattern of sinestro and atrocitus.
2106,2020-06-27 19:10:16,hgy1dz,Scarecrow was the first character who died in the Injustice comics and he was playable in Injustice 2. NRS cares about continuity about as much as Damian about his father's no killing rule.
2107,2020-06-27 18:15:22,hgy1dz,"It's not that difficult to read, but as you wish:

2108,2020-08-05 17:39:39,hgy1dz,He’s probably going to be in the story still if not a playable character considering he’s usually the guy who does all the tech stuff
2109,2020-06-27 18:41:24,hgy1dz,"Yeah, I can see that. They look different but have the same moves."
2110,2020-06-27 19:26:54,hgy1dz,They added then because some characters who are similar to characters in the game could be playable

2136,2020-08-19 22:47:44,icprok,Appreciate it but the reality is the community ain't a big fan of me so you're a bold fellow for posting this! ;P
2137,2020-08-19 18:00:32,icprok,"When we are talking about onscreen talent, we have to remember that the likes of Pansy, DDK and Sean have casted multiple CSGO tournaments over the years. Just like CSGO players, their casting skill set transfer over so well that we are spoilt to have them. 

The ""newer"" casters and commentators are coming over from different esports where they aren't used to calling out the situations that Valorant puts them in and yet, we have an incredible amount who will only get better as the scene grows.

We need casters like Goldenboy who can hype the right moments and run the play by play side of things just as much as we need the technical breakdown. GB and Gaskin, Ryan and Tombizz for a few have already grow  as casters and will definitely keep improving as we go. Constructive feedback is good but shitting on them when we are spoilt and in an incredibly good place like this is not the play. (To all not aimed at OP)"
2138,2020-08-19 16:39:11,icprok,"Simply doesn't compare to Sean Gares and DDK. Maybe if either of those guys was paired with GB it would be a decent show, but he just doesn't have the depth."
2139,2020-08-19 15:54:00,icprok,"I don't agree with a lot of this post, but here's why: 

While goldenboy is fine for a majority of casual players, he lacks a lot of depth in the analysis and round breakdown side of things. You could argue that it's not his job but when events lack the presence of an analysis desk, he's on double duty. This is especially apparent during breaks between games where the analysis/post game breakdown is borderline useless chit chat/regurgitating information that is apparent and obvious. Twitch chat is obviously NOT a good benchmark for feedback, but chat isn't spamming ResidentSleeper for no reason, the actual content is lacking regardless if twitch chat is being annoying or not. ~~Calling the chat ""irons"" instead of addressing the lack of analytical depth isn't the way to go about it.~~ 

This lack of strategic depth also affects his mid round casting where he makes the wrong call when a pro does a play for a nuanced reason and it doesn't get recognized or is recognized for the wrong reasons. And on a more personal preference level side of things, his constant off track references or conversations really are distracting and often lead to me muting the stream.

That's not to say he doesn't do anything well, he's a good play by play caster and with his personality I wouldn't mind him as a host, as I think he'd do really well in that role. But as a VALORANT specific caster I don't personally like his work.


Watching DDK/Sgares last Faze event really showed the difference in the quality of casting from people who know the game at a high level vs just casting ""to cast"" if  that makes sense."
2140,2020-08-19 16:49:28,icprok,"Not to seem like there is an angry mob disagreeing with the OP, but I am also on the side of the fence feeling that Goldenboy really lacks knowledge of the game and it shows when he casts. If he was more the ""color commentator"" as opposed to the vocal majority play-by-play it wouldn't be so jarring, but unfortunately he dominates the other caster. This unfortunately leaves us with a lot of Goldenboy moments where he is just making basic calls that you could plug into any other FPS and would be equally relevant.   


I think Goldenboy is great for a host. He brings great energy and seems to be a swell guy, but I feel like people who dig much deeper into WHY players and teams are doing what they are doing fit better in the play-by-play role. Also, doesn't hurt to add in information about a player/team's history in those dead air moments instead of the more common fluff we get."
2141,2020-08-20 19:25:19,icprok,I like him ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2142,2020-08-21 05:21:13,icprok,"Hi Goldenboy, is there somewhere I can DM you? I think I could help you a lot."
2143,2020-08-19 23:17:21,icprok,"Dont sweat it dude. Youll get better as time goes on. Youre dedicating a lot of time to improve which has shown in the last couple tourneys you have casted. You cant please everyone. 

Ill say this, i think what people want is a more logical breakdown of the plays, an analysis that requires a deep understanding of the game. I think if you have someone with that trait working alongside you, itll make a good dynamic with your play-by-play casting."
2144,2020-08-20 00:03:30,icprok,I’ll risk it
2145,2020-08-20 00:06:43,icprok,"I believe most if not all of us replying in here, Goldenboy, just wanted to play devil's advocate and provide constructive criticism so Valorant eSports as a whole can trend upward. Your energy is awesome and you keep people's attention which is why you're so good at your job. We're just being critical because we are passionate and have been spoiled with talent who understand this genre at a high high level. You're working on your craft and we appreciate you for it. Just don't be afraid to reach out to someone like Sean Gares for some tactical teaching. The man is incredible with explaining what a team/player is doing, why they are doing it and what that means for the remainder of the round. There are many others in the scene who, while not the GOAT like Sean, I am sure could help make sense of different strats/decisions that could change everyone's opinion in this thread.

&#x200B;

Also, I hope we didn't offend or upset you man. Definitely not the intent. We all just want to build up Valorant eSports. <3"
2146,2020-08-20 06:14:39,icprok,"Hey man, you are an excellent play by play commentator, always have been. You just need good color commentary backing you up and adding context. You are one of the best hype commentators in any esports genre. Hope to see you cast with seangares or ddk someday."
2147,2020-08-20 06:48:13,icprok,Still less cringe then moses he is just wtf
2148,2020-08-19 16:03:21,icprok,Sgares and DDK were amazing casters especially in being able to break down what teams are doing.
2149,2020-08-19 16:09:32,icprok,"i think goldenboy has improved his casting since the beta, but hes still not knowledgeable nor does he give interesting insight, and that is essential. he isn't screaming wildly as much anymore, which i appreciate from him, but unless he's going to sit down and study counterstrike theory daily i think they need to pair him with someone who knows what they are talking about.

i really like goldenboy, and actually think he's an s-tier desk host, so i want to see him succeed both bc i like him and for the good of the stream experience, but he (along with many valorant casters) need to be paired with cs vets so we get some proper insight if he is going to stick with the caster position.

e: and i agree with you that i hate how he is always shittalking chat and calling them irons as if he is a good player himself - my friends play against him in gold, hes not a good player, so that rubs me the wrong way. our biggest criticism of him is his lack of knowledge and understanding of the game, and his response is 'iron chat' while completely misreading the game happening in front of him. i like the guy, but his analysis needs heavy work and the best way to do that is give him a competent partner."
2150,2020-08-20 01:08:23,icprok,"I’m not offended because realistically I know that I’ve been studying and putting in a lot of work deep diving into this game because there’s a lot of great resources out there that allow me to do so. That said, I do believe that even if I were to say things correctly I still wouldn’t be acknowledged by the CS diehards and I get it. 

They’re viewed as higher quality than myself. It’s a different world that I was never part of and I’ve accepted it. My whole career I’ve had to prove myself, be doubted, and show I’m the hardest worker in the room. Just the way it is. I accept the challenge ;)"
2151,2020-08-19 16:12:20,icprok,"100% this, they were able to point out things that weren't obvious at first and got into the nitty-gritty of the round/strat. Pointing out these small details that have a huge impact in the round is something that you'll rarely see in a Goldenboy/Gaskin cast. That's not to say ddk/sean were perfect, Sean even said himself that his tone needs work as it sometimes sounds dull, but I'd value the ingame knowledge over how loud he can scream."
2152,2020-08-21 18:41:30,icprok,I was so disappointed at how due to the nature of Valorant not giving the casters any downtime Sean wasn't able to finish a lot of the detailed thoughts he had between rounds. There was a few times he started explaining some nuanced interaction that the pros had done that was really cool but he had to abandon it because something important for the next round came up.
2153,2020-08-19 16:20:05,icprok,"Yea I definitely think Goldenboy would be a great desk host as his personality and ability to keep the conversation flowing is really good. I'd also like to see him paired with a caster who knows CS fundamentals and see how that works out.

~~if he's really a gold level player he has a LOT to learn before calling others ""irons"", even as a joke~~"
2154,2020-08-20 16:11:18,icprok,"Some CS:GO fans are so toxic they should be kept in a secure vault so as to avoid polluting anything that is organic and alive. To get their respect you'll have to get Radiant by playing Sheriff-only with an inverted controller on PC while being blindfolded and drugged down on ketamine, using a PC that runs 24 fps only, and with 300 ping. 

Just continue doing your thing, and you'll get the respect of those who really matter in the end, which are everybody else."
2155,2020-08-20 06:31:18,icprok,I'm a fan. Keep it up.
2156,2020-08-19 22:54:57,icprok,"Don't think I've ever insulted anyone watching by calling them irons while casting so that's not cool to lie about that because you don't like me but whateves... I get it.

Also, I played with my community in ranked. Haven't really played much ranked since I've been watching VOD's and taking notes in my stream. I started playing KB/M full time about 3 months ago so my aim is no where near where people who've been playing CS for years have been but I'm proud of my progress."
2157,2020-08-19 16:22:57,icprok,"yeah im serious about the gold thing, my league friends are gold ranked and they've played against him and the ow caster bren a couple times a couple weeks ago."
2158,2020-08-19 23:33:31,icprok,"~~You've definitely called chat irons before though? Unless I was completely dreaming I'm near 100% certainty I can pull up a VOD and find it.~~ I know you're not trying to attack or insult viewers but rather to write off/gloss over their constant dumb spam. 

I don't personally like your style of casting but have nothing against you as a person, I'm glad you're putting in the effort to get better as a lot of people wouldn't and that's respectable. There's just a lack of analysis that a lot of us crave when watching the best players in the world play. I hope you didn't/don't take this as an insult.

Edit: I apologize for the misinformation. Can't be bothered to sift through hours of VODs, so I'm gonna take an L on this one."
2159,2020-08-19 22:55:22,icprok,Haven't played with Bren in weeks but GG's to your friends I guess?
2160,2020-08-20 01:09:51,icprok,"I know Moses would make the joke with chat but I know I’ve never done that before. Not my style. I’m aware of the disdain people have for me so I’m not going to unnecessarily poke the beast for no reason lol. 

All good though and I appreciate the response."

2162,2020-08-21 18:46:54,icprok,"That's definitely Moses' thing, he does that at least once every stream I have seen. I think you might be confusing him with Goldenboy. I can't definitively say Goldenboy has never done it, but he never did it in any of the streams I watched."
2163,2020-08-19 23:49:47,icprok,"Can't sift through hours of VODs that aren't available on twitch anymore, but I've definitely heard it before and I'm sure others have also. I distinctly remember wtfmoses bringing it up and Goldenboy playing off of it/saying it himself before, but I could be wrong without any evidence.

2237,2020-08-18 21:50:57,ic5u76,"They made 5 of them?! The first one was okay but the second one was B movie level iirc.

Edit: I'm now on a scorpion king binge now"
2238,2020-08-18 20:19:40,ic5u76,I liked it :(
2239,2020-08-19 15:23:01,ic5u76,Really? I run through then since I’m constantly kiting. On the contrary I can stay pretty self sufficient with Scorpias prayer pot and food drops
2240,2020-08-19 04:15:39,ic5u76,This movie was not well received. It's got some bad cgi.
2241,2020-08-19 05:28:16,ic5u76,🦀dorito runes🦀
2242,2020-08-18 21:37:22,ic5u76,"Yup my buddy is 1 def pure as well but damn dude that’s insane, 4x the drop rate couldn’t imagine😂"
2243,2020-08-18 23:03:08,ic5u76,"eh 1 def pure or 99 def, it's the same dps lol."
2244,2020-08-19 13:46:54,ic5u76,Seers ring seems useless there you would be better off even with Explorer's imo. Or Ring of the Gods / Suffering. Also could swap nezzy for a mitre. I would also swap ma2 cape for an ardy cloak unless it gives you a max hit.
2245,2020-08-18 18:50:18,ic5u76,make sure to bring ice barrages(the pouches if you dont have a rune pouch) and bringing blighted pots and food will save money
2246,2020-08-19 15:41:11,ic5u76,What happens when a pker comes at you? Do you have a plan of evasion? I get smoked every time a pker shows up.
2247,2020-08-18 21:53:49,ic5u76,"Yep, the last one came out in 2018 and has two of the main dudes from Spartacus in it. I've only seen the 1st and 2nd and yeah by the 2nd it was already downhill so be warned lol"
2248,2020-08-19 15:43:47,ic5u76,"Yeah bro, i use to love this movie as a kid."
2249,2020-08-19 15:32:04,ic5u76,"Yeah I usually only have to freeze Scorpia twice before she’s dead. If you spawn healers before the first freeze is over then you can freeze the healers, move Scorpia to the corner, then freeze her there. The sang staff takes care of all the healing."
2250,2020-08-19 05:58:06,ic5u76,You’re confusing The Scorpion King starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson which OP is watching with The Mummy Returns where Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson plays the scorpion king
2251,2020-08-19 05:02:21,ic5u76,There’s a cool video on YouTube of some CGI artists actually re-doing a part from the movie with modern CGI and it turned out pretty good
2252,2020-08-19 01:01:58,ic5u76,You get punished more if you get hit from her tho
2253,2020-08-18 19:51:28,ic5u76,You never use a rune pouch now as you can use the ice sacks for barrage and blitz which is pretty useful at scorpia
2254,2020-08-18 19:04:00,ic5u76,If you took literally two seconds to look at their inventory you’d see they do.
2255,2020-08-19 15:42:44,ic5u76,If it’s a team I usually die. If it’s a single pker it’s easy to go in and out of cave and then run west to get gap.
2256,2020-08-19 15:33:16,ic5u76,I’m using trident that’s prob why. I only freeze twice and still use a lot of stamina’s
2257,2020-08-19 09:58:41,ic5u76,Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson
2258,2020-08-19 06:07:47,ic5u76,"I think that's on Corridor Digital's channel

Edit: found it: https://youtu.be/KH1V6CHO1Jk"
2259,2020-08-19 01:47:05,ic5u76,"but if you do the boss properly, you dont get hit by her at all"
2260,2020-08-19 03:03:49,ic5u76,but you never get hit by her since that's what the barrage sacks are for. you just farcast the whole time. like yeah you can splash on spawn but the boss consistently drops food lol
2261,2020-08-18 20:01:29,ic5u76,"oh, i thought the runes alone might be cheaper than pouches but looks like i was wrong, thanks for pointing that out though, i think blitz and barrage use the same runes anyway so it doesnt \*really\* matter but sacks are the cheaper option sooo"
2262,2020-08-18 19:18:36,ic5u76,"someone asked for their gear setup, i added onto that reccomandation, i dont see the problem here"
2263,2020-08-19 04:16:26,ic5u76,Yeah but thousands of kills some mistakes will happen lol
2264,2020-08-19 03:25:35,ic5u76,"What are pkers like there,  compared to other wildly bosses?"
2265,2020-08-19 01:47:58,ic5u76,"you shoulda just looked at the picture, op is doing everything you told him"
2266,2020-08-19 15:43:02,ic5u76,"Also, fyi never bring rune pouch in wildy since if you die you lose it regardless."
2267,2020-08-18 20:11:05,ic5u76,Maybe you should've replied to the original question? Idk people just love to hate here
2268,2020-08-20 21:50:06,ic5u76,"so your punishment being 1 additional brew sip over a couple hundred kills, good fight the brew eco is gonna crash with that amount of consumption"
2269,2020-08-19 14:50:58,ic5u76,Not many pkers because you have to go in to check then wait 15seconds to hop and possibly get hit by a scorpia. Meanwhile at bear or spider u just hop within a second
2270,2020-08-19 13:18:30,ic5u76,They’re generally meaner at Scorpia as compared to pkers at other wildy bosses.
2271,2020-08-19 06:01:44,ic5u76,you ok? i was adding onto his reccomandation to the other guy lol
2272,2020-08-19 17:10:56,ic5u76,"ugh

new death mechanics are aids, lost my graceful doing ardy easy diary level step a bit ago, thought it would protect since i only brought 3 pieces of graceful and that was it"
2273,2020-08-21 16:41:47,ic5u76,Dam bro that blows. I didn't graceful got immediately terminated especially if its one of the protected items. I know deeper than 20 wildy most untradeables turn to coins when you die unless you have them trouvered

2333,2020-08-18 17:53:01,ibzhdc,How was Dwayne Johnson poor growing up when his dad was a wrestler in a good promotion?
2334,2020-08-18 17:54:12,ibzhdc,When he was still The Pebble
2335,2020-08-18 18:02:34,ibzhdc,"Are y'all getting Rocky vibes too?

Pun intended..."
2336,2020-08-18 18:05:12,ibzhdc,Everyone watching did not expect that kid to be the biggest movie star in the world. And also it's most charismatic person.
2337,2020-08-18 18:11:20,ibzhdc,"Quit playin, we know that’s Bruno Mars."
2338,2020-08-18 18:13:32,ibzhdc,that eyebrow

2340,2020-08-18 18:24:31,ibzhdc,"Man, Rocky sported a trapezius muscle The Rock has not been able to match."
2341,2020-08-18 18:28:55,ibzhdc,"I hope his daughter will be known as like, the Pebble or something.

Or what else is there after 'Rocky Johnson' and 'Dwayne The Rock Johnson'? Rocking?"
2342,2020-08-18 18:28:56,ibzhdc,That hair though
2343,2020-08-18 18:31:08,ibzhdc,Looks like Bruno Mars
2344,2020-08-18 18:36:24,ibzhdc,Muscle runs in that family

2346,2020-08-18 18:43:15,ibzhdc,Why does the rock with hair look like he belongs with the Jackson 5?
2347,2020-08-18 18:47:25,ibzhdc,"I don't know if he's a lot older than I thought, or if he's just one of those kids who looked like an adult then they were like 10."
2348,2020-08-18 18:52:09,ibzhdc,Is getting that type of body possible being natty?
2349,2020-08-18 18:52:25,ibzhdc,I thought this was one of those deep fakes for  sec ha
2350,2020-08-18 18:57:26,ibzhdc,Dad looks like he could have also fathered Russell Wilson.
2351,2020-08-18 18:58:26,ibzhdc,Dwayne the Pebble Johnson

2353,2020-08-18 19:13:58,ibzhdc,He actually pulls the eyebrow for a split second as he looks around!
2354,2020-08-18 19:17:08,ibzhdc,I like his dads physique better honestly.
2355,2020-08-18 19:20:31,ibzhdc,"Wow so amazing /s 

My god Y’all are pathetic, worshipping celebrities for doing jack shit. Y’all will suck anyone off if the media tells you to"
2356,2020-08-18 19:23:30,ibzhdc,Man I remember waking up Saturday mornings to watch WWF. Rocky Johnson and Tony Atlas were two of my favorite wrestlers and was always a treat when they teamed up together.
2357,2020-08-18 19:23:40,ibzhdc,Wowie
2358,2020-08-18 19:32:43,ibzhdc,"Wow, his pops was insanely good looking."
2359,2020-08-18 19:34:44,ibzhdc,Rockys hair just looks fake to me. Its bizarre. Reminds me of Pierces dads ivory toupee from Community.
2360,2020-08-18 19:41:41,ibzhdc,He looks so much like his dad. I think it's really nice that he is know as The Rock and his dad is Rocky. It's a touching tribute.
2361,2020-08-18 19:49:17,ibzhdc,Back when he was the pebble
2362,2020-08-18 19:50:56,ibzhdc,“Oh don’t know Young Thug tbh
2363,2020-08-18 19:51:54,ibzhdc,What about this is “amazing” ?
2364,2020-08-18 19:59:33,ibzhdc,After a few of my favorite lines.
2365,2020-08-18 19:59:43,ibzhdc,They both look deepfaked
2366,2020-08-18 20:02:36,ibzhdc,Dwayne Johnson the Pebble

2371,2020-08-18 20:16:13,ibzhdc,That's when Dwayne Johnson used to be the singer for Thin Lizzy
2372,2020-08-18 20:19:49,ibzhdc,"I rarely see Dwayne Johnson talking about his African American side, he seems much closer to his Islander side."
2373,2020-08-18 20:29:00,ibzhdc,The best part was how it showed the fight he was watching
2374,2020-08-18 20:30:01,ibzhdc,The man has no nipples
2375,2020-08-18 20:34:27,ibzhdc,"You can tell he already knew where he was headed. That's the face of a man (just gonna say Dwayne was born already a man, lol) that contains so much confidence & determination."
2376,2020-08-18 20:35:32,ibzhdc,I thought this dude supposedly came from nothing.
2377,2020-08-18 20:39:41,ibzhdc,wait. WAIT. 1982? HE'S TEN YEARS OLD HERE? HE LOOKS AT LEAST TWENTY
2378,2020-08-18 20:52:42,ibzhdc,Imagine having rock as a friend as a kid

2383,2020-08-18 21:42:14,ibzhdc,Just look at that smoldering intensity!
2384,2020-08-18 21:43:17,ibzhdc,I woulda thought he was a narc too

2397,2020-08-18 22:45:20,ibzhdc,Reminds me of Barron at his dad’s rallies.
2398,2020-08-18 23:00:27,ibzhdc,He also played his own dad on an Episode of That 70s Show.
2399,2020-08-18 23:03:18,ibzhdc,those delts are capped af

2413,2020-08-19 01:05:55,ibzhdc,His dad looks like Mac from IASIP when they made lethal weapon
2414,2020-08-19 01:11:44,ibzhdc,Whose father-in-law I learned today played in a James Bond film
2415,2020-08-19 01:17:44,ibzhdc,TIL The Rocks papa was hot
2416,2020-08-19 01:19:14,ibzhdc,Dwayne was 7 years old there haha

2421,2020-08-19 01:43:29,ibzhdc,Holy shit! He was just 10 years old at the time!
2422,2020-08-19 03:58:51,ibzhdc,His dad had a better body than him and it's not even close
2423,2020-08-19 04:43:27,ibzhdc,It looks like a deep fake

2427,2020-08-19 14:07:06,ibzhdc, He's from Nova Scotia 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
2428,2020-08-18 16:14:34,ibzhdc,"he looks like most pacific islander kids i see :), also is his dad also chief on a nation/island/tribe? Okay i got it wrong its his mum whos the daughter of the chief of Samoa"
2429,2020-08-18 16:43:12,ibzhdc,Hard to believe he was only 4 years old in this clip.
2430,2020-08-18 16:46:00,ibzhdc,G E N E T I C S

2432,2020-08-18 12:42:22,ibzhdc,"Or that he'd also become **The Most Electrifying Man in Sports Entertainment!**

Never did I expect in the 90's that he'd be as big as he is today (no pun intended). You saw the talent, the charisma. But I didn't foresee that expanding past wrestling. All I experienced by then was Hogan's mediocre movies."
2433,2020-08-18 17:17:56,ibzhdc,"Also he just recently surpassed Kylie as the #1 IG influencer.  Apparently he can charge up to 8 figures for a post.

Imagine earning millions for something everyone else does for free obsessively"
2434,2020-08-18 15:46:25,ibzhdc,"I think their success lies in how wholesome they are... after all, the Rock is “the people’s” champ.

He does have strong confidence but isn’t too cocky and full of himself.  But overall, he is a man of the people"
2435,2020-08-18 17:18:36,ibzhdc,Every top actor of every generation will be the highest earning actor of all time up until that point due to inflation
2436,2020-08-18 17:20:28,ibzhdc,Samuel Jackson is the highest earning actor of all time
2437,2020-08-18 16:31:43,ibzhdc,What? Is this real? Why
2438,2020-08-18 18:13:00,ibzhdc,"It’s all about being that four quadrant talent. Can you appeal to young males, young females, older males and older females? That’s real value to studios. Will Smith was the last to do it really effectively, maybe Tom Cruise before that. Johnson is really the only one right now."
2439,2020-08-18 15:30:56,ibzhdc,Is that true? He's not even a super great actor
2440,2020-08-18 17:05:04,ibzhdc,And everyone would smell what he was cookin'
2441,2020-08-18 17:18:57,ibzhdc,Funny enough he started his acting career on that 70's show acting as his father wrestling
2442,2020-08-18 17:51:53,ibzhdc,"Be. Cool.
Hilarious.


Ciao."
2443,2020-08-18 18:44:09,ibzhdc,he knew. its a big club and we ain't in it
2444,2020-08-18 18:47:23,ibzhdc,He smelled what he was cooking
2445,2020-08-18 18:50:43,ibzhdc,"Currently, inflation means he gets passed by the next big star."
2446,2020-08-18 19:17:39,ibzhdc,">of all time

Bit of a stretch."
2447,2020-08-18 19:51:15,ibzhdc,How is he a highest earning actor?
2448,2020-08-18 20:13:41,ibzhdc,"Well, he does make like 20 movies a year."
2449,2020-08-18 20:30:46,ibzhdc,"I wonder if he knew he would be mainlining steroids and lying about it for his whole career as well, all the while telling everyone with enough work you could look like him. Just look at dude's head."
2450,2020-08-18 21:05:41,ibzhdc,Harrison Ford? De Niro? Tom cruise? Depp?
2451,2020-08-18 23:50:32,ibzhdc,Given how actors paid today are paid more than a decade ago... I doubt it.
2452,2020-08-19 00:19:23,ibzhdc,"Let’s be real, his movies are so bland and generic these days."
2453,2020-08-18 17:48:07,ibzhdc,Don't forget 49th president!!
2454,2020-08-18 17:42:35,ibzhdc,He’s not even remotely close.
2455,2020-08-18 16:36:47,ibzhdc,This is not true.
2456,2020-08-18 13:39:20,ibzhdc,He does.  Personality looks exactly the same.
2457,2020-08-18 16:10:18,ibzhdc,Pappa Rock is utterly j-j-j-j-j-j-jacked!
2458,2020-08-18 17:53:38,ibzhdc,A lot of his early gimmick was being a legacy. He copied a lot from his old man and made it his own.
2459,2020-08-18 23:55:30,ibzhdc,"Who Dwayne? Yeah, he also had That Bruno Mars look"
2460,2020-08-18 20:38:49,ibzhdc,Woodburn has little chance of being kept....

2465,2020-08-18 18:43:36,ibzhdc,Yeah but because he's [taller than his dad](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/EOWxD4lWkAA18fU.jpg) he doesn't have his roundness. Like his muscles got stretched to fit the new frame. If he didn't have the [same insertions](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b6/b4/ce/b6b4ce5d27bb2843b85438b97d6b059d.jpg) as his dad he would look [even bigger. ](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/52/22/bd/5222bd4dad981b28615a6cc9bea89e6c.jpg)

2482,2020-08-18 17:50:46,ibzhdc,I think he's said when he transferred high schools everyone thought he was a narc because he looked so old.

2489,2020-08-18 17:06:52,ibzhdc,Apparently that was his first acting job... Just learned that Rocky Johnson died in January.
2490,2020-08-18 20:10:54,ibzhdc,He apparently always looked a lot older than he was as a kid/teenager. [This was him at 15.](https://i.imgur.com/PzN9HaU.jpg) In his first book he said that he lost his virginity at 14 to a high school senior because she didn’t realize how young he was.
2491,2020-08-18 18:32:10,ibzhdc,He looks like a plastic action figure. It’s the poor quality of the video blurring features.

Some people brush off Rock's success due to his dad being a wrestler but no other second or third generation wrestler has even come close to the Rock's success."

2504,2020-08-18 17:18:50,ibzhdc,"No, his dad was black, his mother was/is Samoan."
2505,2020-08-18 17:32:33,ibzhdc,"His dad was a black man from Nova Scotia, Canada. Not a chief, but definitely an islander."
2506,2020-08-18 18:09:07,ibzhdc,His dad is clearly black. What are you on about?
2507,2020-08-18 20:18:42,ibzhdc,What kind of pacific Islanders do you see? You sure you're on the right continent dude.
2508,2020-08-18 15:51:25,ibzhdc,"He kind of does mediocre movies though. It's not like he's a dramatic actor. What he does, he does very well. But I can't think a movie he's done in the last 10 years that was a must see. Maybe I'm forgetting.

This isn't hate either I love the Rock since I'm a child in the 90s. But Bautista's one scene in Blade Runner 2049 is more dramatic than anything the Rock has done off the top of my head.

Edit: some of yall are misreading me. I said his *MOVIES* aren't great/are mediocre. Not saying he isn't good in those movies. He knows what he's doing with his image. Its just not A plus films."
2509,2020-08-18 17:13:53,ibzhdc,I was the complete opposite. I thought he had so much charisma that he was going to be big beyond wrestling. I didn’t know about his life story during that time but after learning about it I’m more happy for success. He was one of the best characters in the WWE
2510,2020-08-18 16:52:35,ibzhdc,"Or the Brahma Bull, The Great One, The People's Champion."
2511,2020-08-18 17:23:14,ibzhdc,You obviously didn't smell what the Rock was cooking back then.
2512,2020-08-18 17:36:51,ibzhdc,"Nothing will surpass the GOAT movie ""Suburban Commando,"" staring Hulk Hogan."
2513,2020-08-18 21:39:48,ibzhdc,"Seems like he took over where Arnold Schwarzenegger left off. So every generation there is a singular need for a massive, buff mildly guy mildly capable of acting. I respect the Rock though because his skills really grew into his new role compared to where his career started.

Gen Z better start pumping some muscle for when he retires, there will only be 1 opportunity every ~10-15 years lol."
2514,2020-08-18 23:59:44,ibzhdc,"And just think. Once upon a time his claim to fame was being a failed football player. Dude has a drive and determination that few ever attain.

I know people rag on him for cheesy twitter bullshit but he lives and breathes that stuff."

Who can forget *~~Tropic~~* *Thunder in Paradise*?"
2518,2020-08-18 17:12:33,ibzhdc,Yeah because no one was doing it back then.
2519,2020-08-18 18:38:15,ibzhdc,The only reason a tiny number of people can earn millions is because other people are doing it for free obsessively.
2520,2020-08-18 17:52:04,ibzhdc,His whole schtick when he was wrestling as a bad guy was how over the top cocky and arrogant he was. But he backed up and ironically people could not get enough
2521,2020-08-18 17:55:33,ibzhdc,"True but I'm rather surprised to learn that Dwayne Johnson is the ""top actor"" of right now."
2522,2020-08-18 18:58:36,ibzhdc,Dont forget population growth and GDP growth.
2523,2020-08-19 07:09:05,ibzhdc,Highest grossing.
2524,2020-08-18 16:42:24,ibzhdc,Because he's the best brand. What sells the most right now? Action and adventure films. Who fits those roles best? Dwyane Johnson lmao
2525,2020-08-18 17:20:26,ibzhdc,"Megastars choose their roles very carefully.  It's a science.
  
* Does this movie have broad reach?
* Is it a subject the general population would be interested in?
* How was the source material?
* Family friendly?
* Does this role fit my persona?

Add into the fact that he works a lot.  So it's also a quantity game.

But I will say even though he isn't Daniel day Lewis or anything at least he fits the role he plays, even if that role is just funny buff guy, super action star."

2527,2020-08-18 15:51:02,ibzhdc,"Lol he has range as an actor and yes he is a great actor. He can almost play anybody, just cause he isn’t winning Tony’s or oscars doesn’t make you a great actor. Leonardo didn’t win one his whole career up until recently but does that not make him a great actor?"
2528,2020-08-18 20:09:32,ibzhdc,Yeah I didn't realise how high the OG's like Harrison Ford and Samuel Jackson actually get paid. But The Rock still has a lot of time left in the game so I think he'll get to being one of the highest in history to be honest
2529,2020-08-18 20:08:17,ibzhdc,He gets paid the most. Easy Google
2530,2020-08-18 18:11:59,ibzhdc,What do you mean?
2531,2020-08-18 16:41:06,ibzhdc,Dwayne Johnson is literally the highest paid actor right now
2532,2020-08-18 16:39:58,ibzhdc,"It is. As per Forbes. Ridiculous and unfair to others, though."
2533,2020-08-18 17:08:00,ibzhdc,He's pretty much *The Rock* with hair.
2534,2020-08-19 01:56:26,ibzhdc,Lol
2535,2020-08-18 16:20:56,ibzhdc,Let's say it together: YES HOMO

2537,2020-08-18 17:25:53,ibzhdc,"Knock off that ""no homo"" shit."
2538,2020-08-18 17:18:30,ibzhdc,Ruined a perfectly good comment by bringing your insecurities with you. No one cares if you're homo or not.
2539,2020-08-18 22:15:41,ibzhdc,Yes please.
2540,2020-08-18 19:27:54,ibzhdc,Jesus Christ. He's got boulder shoulders before he put any serious eat on!
2541,2020-08-18 19:28:53,ibzhdc,"It was the 70s and he was in a sport that wouldn't think about testing. The man definitely used drugs. I would also say that he had the right genes and workouts on top of that, of course."
2542,2020-08-18 21:23:53,ibzhdc,"I mean, it was confirmed that the Rock was on cycle lol. Wrestlers are very prone to it. Just look at [John Cena at age 18.](https://imgur.com/r/bodybuilding/59w9MER)"

2563,2020-08-19 05:49:51,ibzhdc,Dwayne Johnson is in line to become the chief of Samoa (but on his mother side)
2564,2020-08-19 05:53:11,ibzhdc,"I see a lot of New zealanders and general islanders (as an Aussie) but yeah dwayne looks a lot like my old school mates. The hair, the skin, the smile the general feel/look"
2565,2020-08-18 16:05:51,ibzhdc,"I enjoy both. I like how Bautista really went all in on acting, taking classes etc... Love that Blade Runner 2049 scene."
2566,2020-08-18 16:49:53,ibzhdc,"Say what you will, but Johnson is a pretty committed actor. He'll never win an Oscar, but he also doesnt seem like he shows up late on set everyday. 

I've always gotten the vibe that he is fully committed to everything that he does, and that is admirable."
2567,2020-08-18 16:00:15,ibzhdc,I kind of liked Walking Tall.
2568,2020-08-18 17:15:48,ibzhdc,Baywatch was a must see if you’re in a hotel waiting for your SO to get ready and you dont wanna flip channels
2569,2020-08-18 16:08:57,ibzhdc,"The Rock has no range whatsoever compared to Dave Bautista. Dave's moment really shined in Blade Runner 2049, at least to me.

With The Rock; you know you're going to get a movie with 'witty' one liners, comedy, some love, and a dramatic muscle shot scene."
2570,2020-08-18 17:07:35,ibzhdc,... Moana. And he did the song You're Welcome in the movie. I know it's voice acting but it's honestly legendary.
2571,2020-08-18 17:08:40,ibzhdc,I smell a jabroni.
2572,2020-08-18 16:27:50,ibzhdc,"Not a movie, but have you seen Ballers?  Rock isn't Tom Hanks-ing it out there but he can do drama just fine.  His acting is 1000x better than it was when he started out"
2573,2020-08-18 17:06:27,ibzhdc,"He's an action star, he knows where he makes the money.

Bautista as Drax is more dramatic/emotive than The Rock is in a lot of movies hahaha"
2574,2020-08-18 18:02:05,ibzhdc,"Personally I think Bautista has eclipsed Johnson in terms of character roles. Bautista has given us only a handful of films, but his character variety in each role makes him stand out more to me. The Rock is great, but he's almost always playing ""The Rock as x character"". I don't see that as bad, he knows what he's doing and people love it. The dude oozes charisma, and utilizes it. He also seems like a stand up guy, which I appreciate even more. 

Not that it's the most intense role, but Bautista as Drax is wonderful, and his humor and what he brings to the character makes it for me. His comedic timing and actual emotion when necessary are more memorable to me than any specific role The Rock has done."
2575,2020-08-18 17:57:21,ibzhdc,Yeah his movies kinda suck. It’s typically Hollywood trash that makes money in other countries. I like him as a person though.. seems good heartedz
2576,2020-08-18 17:39:30,ibzhdc,"Idk man, he done pretty well in Jumanji."
2577,2020-08-18 17:11:50,ibzhdc,"Dude, he is great in pain and gain, and plays mostly against type too."
2578,2020-08-18 17:13:19,ibzhdc,"Uhhh bro, are the forgetting the cinema masterpieces? All the fast and furious movies he's done!?! Classics! 

/s"
2579,2020-08-18 17:14:46,ibzhdc,"Moana, duh"
2580,2020-08-18 17:15:21,ibzhdc,Moana is a pretty great movie. Unless you're talking live action only?
2581,2020-08-18 18:45:17,ibzhdc,"Snitch is his best movie. It's not a comedy, it's not an action film it's a true story Susan Sarandon is in it as well as the guy who played the punisher. It's really good and a must see The Rock movie."
2582,2020-08-18 19:11:09,ibzhdc,I’d make mediocre movies too if it meant I could be the highest paid actor for years at a time too. You’re saying that as if it’s suppose to be some sort of criticism.
2583,2020-08-18 19:35:22,ibzhdc,Well I don’t think you’re gonna catch Dwayne in an arthouse film or an indie that ends up being a “must see”. The reason why Dwayne is the highest earning actor is because he stars in Mega Blockbuster films with ridiculous budgets and star studded casts. Those movies are always great to see with the family but they are never going to be the “mind blowing must see industry changing” films
2584,2020-08-18 19:38:21,ibzhdc,The Rock doesn’t play characters in movies and shows. The Rock plays the Rock in moves... same with Bruce Willis
2585,2020-08-18 20:01:10,ibzhdc,The rundown with Sean William Scott was fantastic
2586,2020-08-18 20:31:24,ibzhdc,"> Its just not A plus films.

Might not be A+ stuff, but they're entertaining. I find The Rock to just be one of those guys that makes anything he's in better and more enjoyable. The *Fast & Furious* titles he's in wouldn't be nearly as good if he didn't have Jason Statham to play off of."
2587,2020-08-18 20:36:35,ibzhdc,"How was Bladerunner 2049? I remember hearing it come out and then I completely forgot about it, I think I must’ve been busy or something and then never got around to watching it."
2588,2020-08-18 21:03:34,ibzhdc,His role in the show Ballers is dramatic and he’s pretty good. But true for his movies.
2589,2020-08-18 21:34:39,ibzhdc,Gridiron Gang is his best drama
2590,2020-08-18 21:40:37,ibzhdc,"That's because he's not an actor by trade or even one at all some might say. He the same in every role he plays demonstrating the same range. As you say not a big deal, but I can't see him replacing Hoffman's role in Rain Man or Brando in anything at all or a million other roles by decent actors. Comic actors get away without being plausible but he isn't good a one of those either."
2591,2020-08-18 21:41:16,ibzhdc,"Watch Faster. Not exactly Citizen Kane, but it's a reprieve from the blockbuster stuff"
2592,2020-08-18 23:38:10,ibzhdc,Jumanji
2593,2020-08-18 23:56:58,ibzhdc,I agree. Bautista's acting is probably the greatest thing to come out of WWE.
2594,2020-08-19 00:07:22,ibzhdc,Say what you want but Central Intelligence was excellent
2595,2020-08-19 02:02:37,ibzhdc,He does a very good job in his show ballers. It has some comedic moments but his role is a dramatic one
2596,2020-08-19 07:07:39,ibzhdc,*gasp* did you really just call the tooth fairy mediocre?!?!
2597,2020-08-19 07:36:45,ibzhdc,Walk Tall

2599,2020-08-18 16:32:54,ibzhdc,You couldn't smell what the Rock was cooking?
2600,2020-08-18 17:10:21,ibzhdc,"> It's not like he's a dramatic actor. What he does, he does very well.

He doesn't have a lot of range, but he could definitely play a good villain in a drama. 

He played a really interesting bad guy in an SNL sketch (child molesting robot sketch)."
2601,2020-08-18 17:09:56,ibzhdc,He’s actually really decent in the show Ballers.
2602,2020-08-18 21:16:37,ibzhdc,"I take it you haven't seen pain and gain

His role in ballers also shows range

Fast and furious is one of the most successful franchises of all time 

The hell is wrong with you lmao"

Andre the Giant

Hulk Hogan

Roddy Piper

They would like to have a word with you. They just didn't reach the heights in which The Rock has. Doesn't mean they didn't try."
2606,2020-08-19 00:02:35,ibzhdc,"Nah, it's moreso because everytime he speaks he is on a virtual stage with a full stadium watching. And when most people talk there's 10 seats filled."
2607,2020-08-18 19:20:00,ibzhdc,It's more about how prolific he is rather then how much he is getting per film.
2608,2020-08-18 18:49:55,ibzhdc,Have you seen the critically acclaimed art house hit jumanji?
2609,2020-08-19 00:03:54,ibzhdc,I'm trying to think of the best comparison for when I was younger. I want to say Arnold but I'm not sure.
2610,2020-08-18 16:00:37,ibzhdc,"Leo was, at least, nominated."
2611,2020-08-18 16:03:46,ibzhdc,"You seriously compared the rock to leo? The rock literally is an actor due to his large size, and studios think its hilarious to put him next to a small actor like kevin hart. 
What’s his range? 
Like he’s okay but I’m not going to get excited about a film starring him compared to a film that stars leo."
2612,2020-08-18 16:02:34,ibzhdc,I have never seen The Rock do any movie which upon viewing convinced me of his acting skills. I love cinematography but he is not versatile but a selling point (similar to Bruce Willis for the last 20 years) and that's a mark of a mediocre actor who mastered just the one thing they do well every time. Compare him to Adam Sandler in his dramatic roles for example.
2613,2020-08-18 16:34:36,ibzhdc,"Okay, just by you saying ""The Rock has range as an actor"" proves you know nothing about the word ""range"" or even about acting, for that matter."
2614,2020-08-18 21:36:55,ibzhdc,Yeah but of all time should take into account inflation the same way as highest grossing film of all time is gone with the wind.
2615,2020-08-18 17:37:51,ibzhdc,What makes it ridiculous and unfair to others?

2632,2020-08-19 09:46:29,ibzhdc,I read they wanted The Rock but he was unavailable so he suggested they get Mick
2633,2020-08-19 00:47:47,ibzhdc,Rock bottom when he works on those glutes

2637,2020-08-18 17:31:31,ibzhdc,2013-2015 was better than 2016-2020 for me but dude 2016-2018 was also great
2638,2020-08-18 16:09:18,ibzhdc,"Yeah Its tough to get a juicy role when you're 6'5 and weight 260 pounds. You are going to get type casted. Bautusta has dealt with that too. And I think Dwayne could do his fair share of acting if they'd let him. There are scenes in ""Pain and Gain"" that really let him do his thing, so there's one I really enjoyed from this decade. People seemed to forget about it but its actually a really funny dark comedy."
2639,2020-08-18 17:19:32,ibzhdc,That opening scene in blade runner was amazing

https://youtu.be/aZ9Os8cP_gg"
2641,2020-08-18 19:46:11,ibzhdc,Watching that scene made me totally forget that Bautista was ever a professional wrestler. He was so good in that role. It makes me hope he gets more dramatic opportunities.
2642,2020-08-18 23:58:24,ibzhdc,Bautista killed it in Blade Runner.
2643,2020-08-18 17:34:20,ibzhdc,[deleted]
2644,2020-08-18 16:51:40,ibzhdc,It is 100% im not hating on the man and especially not hating on his work ethic. He's just picked a certain way to play the Hollywood game. He's gotta be best in his field for what he's doing.
2645,2020-08-19 07:54:17,ibzhdc,"Well I would hope a man who wakes up around 4am every day isn’t late. Dude has all the time he needs to get going before anybody else is even awake.

Source: The Rock Clock. It’s an alarm app he had made. There’s a setting that goes on his workout schedule. He starts his day with a 2 hour workout before breakfast."
2646,2020-08-18 16:03:04,ibzhdc,"Hey I got no issues if you liked anything hes made at all. They are fun, no brain action flicks. They have a certain appeal that we all can watch and shouldn't be ""ashamed"" of. Also I mentioned last 10 years. Walking Tall was (get this) 2004!!! Sheesh, thats a long time ago now."
2647,2020-08-18 17:41:13,ibzhdc,Have you watched Ballers? I'd say it shows some range.
2648,2020-08-18 16:11:14,ibzhdc,I think The Rock *can* act but he doesn't get the chance because of his action hero status. He wants to be the tough guy and takes roles for the cash over the acting chances.
2649,2020-08-18 18:21:30,ibzhdc,"He was very funny in Be Cool. I'd love to see him do more comedies (and not, like family adventure comedies, but straight-no-chaser comedy movies for grownups)."
2650,2020-08-19 01:13:57,ibzhdc,Have you seen Gridiron Gang?
2651,2020-08-18 20:24:39,ibzhdc,"Would've loved to see The Rock as Gaston tbh. I can see him using his wrestling persona in that character.

Do you smell what Gaston is cooking?"
2652,2020-08-18 17:08:20,ibzhdc,Disney movies don't count. All they make is bangers.
2653,2020-08-18 17:09:48,ibzhdc,Nooooooooo. Read through my comments I really do love the guy. Let's just not act like hes doing the best movies around.
2654,2020-08-18 16:33:58,ibzhdc,"I have seen Ballers its not bad or anything and probably the most consistent drama hes ever been a part of. Hes good in it, but doesn't blow me away. It reminds me of ""frat house"" drama.

I think he can act though just hasn't done that one role where I forget hes The Rock and becomes someone else. Dave Bautista in Blade Runner is a different person. The Rocks whole brand is such that you never forget youre watching The Rock. *insert the people's eyebrow*"
2655,2020-08-18 21:27:45,ibzhdc,"“My turds are famously huge!”

Yep"
2656,2020-08-18 17:12:49,ibzhdc,I address pain and gain somewhere in the thread but I agree for the most part.
2657,2020-08-18 17:17:00,ibzhdc,"Yeah Moana doesn't count, Disney is a whole different thing."
2658,2020-08-18 19:12:44,ibzhdc,Eh the guy I was responding to said he was expecting Hulk Hogan mediocre movies. The Rock kind of does mediocre movies thats all I was getting at. Dudes awesome though.
2659,2020-08-18 20:26:52,ibzhdc,Way more than 10 years ago. Thats from 2003.
2660,2020-08-18 20:38:59,ibzhdc,"It's a great movie. Its not a fast paced action movie its a slow burning investigation flick. But its all there Acting, cinematography, score, plot. Its one of my favorite movies of the last few years. If you like the original Blade Runner and understand that movie's lore you'll like it. One of the best sequels ever in my opinion."
2661,2020-08-18 21:43:03,ibzhdc,I've seen Faster but not in sometime. I remember a paint by numbers revenge flick. But its been 10 years since I've seen it.
2662,2020-08-18 16:35:12,ibzhdc,I can smell it just fine. It smells like popcorn and baby oil.
2663,2020-08-18 18:53:22,ibzhdc,"Loved that show, didn’t really need to act since it was a comedy"
2664,2020-08-18 21:17:23,ibzhdc,"I take it you haven't read the whole thread.

Edit: you've also completely missed what I was saying. Must have reading comprehension issues."
2665,2020-08-18 16:57:16,ibzhdc,EASY BIG FELLA!
2666,2020-08-18 22:30:04,ibzhdc,I meant it wasn't as prevalent to see a wrestler reach the heights that Rock did.. plus so many are transitioning to movies and other forms of media  now a days
2667,2020-08-19 07:28:24,ibzhdc,"""It's the greatest movie of our generation!"" 

-literally no one"
2668,2020-08-18 16:02:14,ibzhdc,Well sure but that’s even more worse no? Now you have this title of almost winning every movie you’re in lol I think the mentions of nominations after the actual awards is dumb.
2669,2020-08-18 16:08:25,ibzhdc,"lol you obviously don’t know movies if you think that’s why they cast him. Sure maybe in his first few movies but not anymore, he can pull of comedy roles with ease. He does action with ease because of his size and ability to do a lot more stunts because he was a wrestler which takes a lot of athleticism than you think. Not comparing them directly just stating that you can be a great actor without having to be nominated by the bullshit oscars which is full of old white dudes anyway."
2670,2020-08-18 16:04:16,ibzhdc,Acting is all subjective tho. Some people like dramatic movies and some don’t. You can’t say the rock can’t “act” yet he constantly gets roles and is now the most paid actor. If that doesn’t make him a good actor then what does? lol
2671,2020-08-18 18:10:12,ibzhdc,"Probably due to the quality of movies he’s in I’d guess. But hey, if he’s willing to put in the effort to pump out *so many movies* of that quality level that he’s the highest paid actor, all the power to him. He puts in the work, he deserves the reward."
2672,2020-08-18 21:49:24,ibzhdc,This comment cracked me up lolol
2673,2020-08-18 22:26:37,ibzhdc,YES NECROHOMO
2674,2020-08-18 21:00:39,ibzhdc,Is that from Orgasmo?
2675,2020-08-18 19:58:25,ibzhdc,Don't apologize to me. Come to terms with your sexuality. No one enjoys dealing with someone who is insecure in themselves.

2677,2020-08-19 01:42:07,ibzhdc,You ain't seen Bad Boys 2?
2678,2020-08-18 16:39:42,ibzhdc,I needed these comments. Thank you.
2679,2020-08-18 19:55:58,ibzhdc,"Yeah, objectively the past 3 years have been great for me, better than all the previous, I've achieved a lot; but for the world at large it's been pretty shitty, or at least for us here in the US under president cheeto."
2680,2020-08-18 16:42:42,ibzhdc,"When you think about Bautista in both GotG and 2049, as well as Villeneuve respecting his skills enough to cast him again in the upcoming Dune... a lot of far more experienced actors would kill for those opportunities!"
2681,2020-08-18 16:44:41,ibzhdc,"*Pain and Gain* was decent, I especially liked the grilling hands scene. You gotta give him some cred for *Jumanji*, which was better than I expected, though admittedly the supporting actors helped a lot. *Skyscraper* and *Rampage* were decent, though not remarkable. He's got some creds but I think the main reason for the money behind him is his ability to bring a crowd to the box office. 

He's a big dude with a background in wrestling. My take is he's filling the roles now that Schwarzenegger would have filled 30 years ago. It won't net him any oscars, but with that kind of money, I doubt he cares. Maybe he'll be governor of California some day."
2682,2020-08-18 17:02:03,ibzhdc,"Wait, did they shrink him for GOTG? He looked like he's 5'7 in those movies"
2683,2020-08-18 20:23:46,ibzhdc,"One of my favorite movies tbh, never got the hate"
2684,2020-08-18 21:28:13,ibzhdc,Pain & Gain is great. I would put it in my top 25 comedy movies
2685,2020-08-18 22:33:06,ibzhdc,That was fantastic
2686,2020-08-18 19:28:50,ibzhdc,He’s fantastic in Hotel Artemis as well
2687,2020-08-18 16:25:19,ibzhdc,"Faster was pretty good imo, and it's from 2010 if I can remember correctly (too lazy to verify lol.)."
2688,2020-08-18 18:58:04,ibzhdc,Ballers is fantastic.
2689,2020-08-19 01:17:36,ibzhdc,"I thought The Rundown was just a fluke, and I wasn't a huge fan of his. Be Cool sold me on him"
2690,2020-08-18 17:18:59,ibzhdc,"Lol I know.

But that's The Rock's talent. He's not in her movies but he's easily the most entertaining actor to most people.

San Andreas? Terrible movie. But I've seen it at least 4 times. I haven't seen all of his movies but even if I think they're bad, I still enjoy them."
2691,2020-08-18 16:57:35,ibzhdc,It's Entourage with sports. You can't tell me Vinny Chase is a good actor. Still watched it though.
2692,2020-08-18 20:42:36,ibzhdc,"Well, looks like I’ll have to add this to watch while in quarantine."
2693,2020-08-18 21:46:12,ibzhdc,"It is for sure, but it's enjoyable and has a good score done by one of the best"
2694,2020-08-18 21:21:05,ibzhdc,"No, I haven't, I was scrolling down and stopped at the first stupid comment I saw and here we are"
2695,2020-08-18 16:16:58,ibzhdc,"Yep I just dont know movies at all I guess. 2 genres =  range. I agree about the awards thing, never disagreed with you there. Just for comparison though, jackie chan has done extreme stunts and multiple genres of films and I wouldn’t call him a good actor. I realize now my disagreement with you comes from differing definitions of acting. Jackie chan better than the rock though"
2696,2020-08-18 18:21:40,ibzhdc,"Your argument for him having range is that he does well in action and action-comedy movies? 


Also not to be insulting but your comments win the daily prize for blurring the line between ridiculous views sincerely held and trolling."
2697,2020-08-18 16:38:30,ibzhdc,"You're confusing the words ""good"" and ""successful"". Yes, The Rock has starred in lots of movies that have collectively grossed billions. Yes, he's a really cool person in general. But as far as acting goes, and I'm talking about the *art* of acting, it's the same thing every movie; dude with big muscles that makes action-hero quips. He's a one-trick pony... And that's okay, because he's obviously still extremely successful for doing just that."
2698,2020-08-19 02:24:28,ibzhdc,Sure is
2699,2020-08-18 20:06:56,ibzhdc,[deleted]
2700,2020-08-19 06:56:12,ibzhdc,"lolol ""naturally muscular."" there's literally nothing about his physique that's natty. go home troll."
2701,2020-08-18 16:45:55,ibzhdc,"Yeah I want more from Dave, in interviews I've seen life long actors commend him on diving full force into acting and trying to be a thespians thespian type actor. Again I can't get over how much that small role in 2049 really set the tone for that movie. It was so good for a 10 minute part."
2702,2020-08-18 16:50:01,ibzhdc,"I wish more of the action movies he were doing would be those classic action movies of the day like Arnold had. I mean we all know what those movies are but throwing on Predator or Total Recall are ""classic"" action flicks. The Rock does enjoyable action movies but I don't see one turinging into a classic of its time like Arnold had so many. Although maybe I'm wrong and one of the Fast and Furious movies will become that even though they were twisted into becoming action movies so it feels strange to me, sort of."
2703,2020-08-18 20:49:32,ibzhdc,Skyscraper is giant piece of shit. His movies are popcorn flicks. Movies that your uncle think are good.
2704,2020-08-18 18:18:50,ibzhdc,I’ve met Dave Bautista at a wrestling show. He is a big guy. Much bigger than he looked in guardians
2705,2020-08-18 17:03:40,ibzhdc,But Google has Dave listed at 6'6. 289. Lol
2706,2020-08-19 03:17:09,ibzhdc,Most of the gotg actors are fairly tall.
2707,2020-08-18 17:02:41,ibzhdc,That is The Rocks height and weight sorry.
2708,2020-08-18 16:29:22,ibzhdc,"It was from 2010. All of his movies can be *pretty good*, I just wouldn't say they are movies you'd tell someone to go see that day. Like ""damn this movie really meant something to me. You gotta check it out.""

You can put on any of his movies and enjoy them for what they are but overall I'd say they don't hold up to really good dramatic movies."
2709,2020-08-18 16:30:16,ibzhdc,Lol is that one of the fast and furious sequels or legitimately a separate movie he was in called faster?
2710,2020-08-18 17:20:43,ibzhdc,Yeah I was never trying to diss The Rock. Just the movies he does.
2711,2020-08-18 16:59:02,ibzhdc,Dont sleep on the OG Aquaman. Lol
2712,2020-08-18 21:50:38,ibzhdc,"For sure. I think any of his movies can be *enjoyable*. None of this is saying he isn't amazing at doing what he's doing. He just makes those certain types of movies. Nothing wrong with that. A lot of them gross a lot of cash. They just aren't like ""great movies"" you know what I mean? Just for those wild rides. Again not a bad thing to have in life. Just is what it is. I watched Hobbs and Shaw in theaters cause my wife and I wanted a ""dumb"" action flick to veg out to one day. And he put on a master class on how to be that guy. It's fun just doesn't hold up to Christopher Nolan or anything like that."
2713,2020-08-18 21:21:52,ibzhdc,Lol ok buddy. Have a good day. Im glad you enjoy his movies.

2719,2020-08-18 18:28:10,ibzhdc,Absolutely agree with you on all the points you've made. Batista killed that part in 2049.
2720,2020-08-18 18:04:25,ibzhdc,"I really loved The Rundown, still one of my favorites of his. By far."
2721,2020-08-18 20:00:19,ibzhdc,Idk man i dont think of the rock when i think of Fast and Furious movies he came too late in the game for him to be apart of the “classic Fast and Furious” conversation
2722,2020-08-18 18:27:26,ibzhdc,I dont know about classic but welcome to the jungle is one of my guilty pleasures. Love that film
2723,2020-08-19 04:49:52,ibzhdc,"> Fast and Furious movies

he's too late into that game to be known for that for sure"
2724,2020-08-18 17:58:47,ibzhdc,Yeah I googled the numbers and got results in metric which I weighed roughly and decided that they check out. The question still stands tho.
2725,2020-08-18 16:49:48,ibzhdc,"What you mean to say is that he's not a serious actor, he's more of an entertainer and probably won't be winning any oscars any time soon. Which, when you see the movies he chooses to do ie: Fast/Furious, Rampage, Jumanji... he's going for the $$ than anything else, so he's doing exactly what he wants to do. 

That said... Pain and Gain is legit a good movie."
2726,2020-08-18 16:39:21,ibzhdc,"Yeah I couldn't agree more. I just think that out of all his movies, this one is the only one I could watch again and enjoy."
2727,2020-08-18 16:35:30,ibzhdc,It's a separate movie where he plays a driver for a bank robbers crew that got betrayed and sent to jail. When he gets out he seeks revenge. Pretty basic script but still I thnk it was a good flick with good action scenes.
2728,2020-08-18 17:27:03,ibzhdc,I understand.
2729,2020-08-18 22:04:24,ibzhdc,"Here's the thing though. A lot of movies made artistically aren't fun to watch. It's not about not understanding subject matter, or having to read subtitles, or anything like that. It's just not fun to watch ""real"" movies a lot of the time. Would you rather watch The Avengers or Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy? Do you want to watch an actor's depiction of what they believe a historic figure to be like (Lincoln), or would you rather watch an actor unleash something fantastical with a character you don't know (Gangs of NY)?"

2739,2020-08-18 18:38:02,ibzhdc,Watch snitch it's a true story and by far the best Rock movie hands down surprised no ones even mentioned that yet.
2740,2020-08-18 16:40:28,ibzhdc,Fair enough.
2741,2020-08-18 22:58:40,ibzhdc,With Billy Bob and Carla Gugino...twas pretty good.

2743,2020-08-18 21:33:47,ibzhdc,Im not low balling him at all. READ THE OTHER COMMENTS. READ the comment you are commenting on. The movies he gets are mostly dumb action flicks. I love him as a person and when he gets a chance to act hes good in them. The movies popularity doesn't make it a great movie. It's like McDonald's you shove garbage into your mouth because it activates all the right receptors in your brain. It doesn't make it good. Holy shit dude. You think I'm talking crap on him but multiple times in this thread I have said its because of his image and movies he does. I know reading and understanding words must be difficult for you but just try a little harder next time. I think you can do it if you do it enough.

2745,2020-08-18 21:54:21,ibzhdc,Lol what does that even mean. No argument so you insult. Pathetic.
2746,2020-08-18 18:58:50,ibzhdc,Wasn’t there a small like precursor about his character that they filmed. I think I saw it on Adam Savages YT channel cuz he has a cameo.
2747,2020-08-18 21:37:54,ibzhdc,Relax guy
2748,2020-08-18 22:03:25,ibzhdc,"I was reading the comments. I got to yours. You're wrong. I was just letting you know, and now I wish I didn't because you're annoying as hell. I didn't need an answer. You're just not right, no need for anything else."
2749,2020-08-18 19:01:40,ibzhdc,"There's a small scene they filmed of him in a bar that adds some context to him, yes."
2750,2020-08-18 21:41:30,ibzhdc,"You comment on my post without even comprehending the words I have written give me shit and then when I correct you, you act like I'm the dumb one. Or the one overreacting.

How about you dont get on my post first and say all sorts of dumb misinformed shit. This whole thing wouldve been avoided if you A) learned to read good. Or B) never opened your mouth to begin with."
2751,2020-08-18 22:04:07,ibzhdc,I read your comment. It was a lousy one and unfair. I was just letting you know. Jesus dude you're out of control.

I just sorta like the idea of taking him out with a million pumps/ I like lever action you know? I'm a very good shot so the important bit would be blinding him first and then it's just a matter of me smoking 2-3 cigars as I wither him down. 

To be fair he'd likely fall down and bash his head on a rock or something.

2770,2020-09-07 01:03:27,inx72c,"For your 49er vs cards critique, id add McKinnon(he’s 4K) as a cheap flyer. If this game goes shootout(which I think it will) mck will benefit a bunch as he’s looked the best receiving passes out of the back field"
2771,2020-09-07 19:19:26,inx72c,"I know Mitch is a terrible real life QB, but he can have big fantasy weeks. I will definitely throw him in some GPP lineups and take advantage of the low ownership. He’s really easy to stack with ARob and Miller"
2772,2020-09-07 12:14:17,inx72c,"You've overlooked the second string RB in GB. That's a three headed monster in that backfield, with reports of all three expected to be involved."
2773,2020-09-07 16:25:23,inx72c,Why no Gurley he's going to see atleast 15 touches an the Seahawks front 7 scares No  one

2776,2020-09-08 06:15:19,inx72c,He'll be injured by the half. Dude is made of glass
2777,2020-09-07 19:18:22,inx72c,I’m a Packers fan and from what I’ve read it doesn’t seem likely Dillon will factor in much at all this season. He didn’t have a great camp
2778,2020-09-07 12:30:08,inx72c,"Jamaal Williams isn't someone I'm overlooking, just someone I don't see being relevant enough to play. He may get a few catches, but he's a very TD-dependent play."
2779,2020-09-07 16:44:57,inx72c,"I'm personally just not confident in Gurley being a strong option this week. It's certainly possible, I just don't see him being worth his salary. Falcons seem much more geared to pass than run the ball, but I could be hella wrong against Seattle. 🤷‍♂️"
2780,2020-09-08 16:52:56,inx72c,"Agree with you. Seahawks gave up 4.9 YPC last season and then lost Clowney. Falcons will run the ball. Not only this, Gurley is a great receiving back. Adds up to a smash play that is going overlooked."
2781,2020-09-10 22:26:51,inx72c,Personally I'd go Landry since he doesn't have Stephon Gilmore covering him like Devante Parker will
2782,2020-09-15 09:47:28,inx72c,"Yes, it will be relatively soon. I started a new job recently with a more normal schedule so my sleep schedule's a bit off, but I'll hopefully get these out more consistently either Tuesday night or Wednesday morning some time each week. I don't know it it'll be as in-depth per game, but I'll talk about key players at the very least."
2783,2020-09-08 06:16:42,inx72c,"Plus, Gurley sucks. He'll pop off a big game here and there but too risky for me"
2784,2020-09-08 17:06:40,inx72c,Falcons oline has improved Gurley will be a top five RB this season i see gurley putting up big numbers in that offense
2785,2020-09-09 01:23:15,inx72c,"Definitely not top 5 lol. Falcons won't field a top 16 line, but they will be better than what the Rams were last year by a lot. Plus, I just dont think Gurley has top 5 positional talent anymore. Cook, CMC, Barkley, Elliott, and Kamara will all finish ahead of him easily. Then you have guys such as Sanders, Drake, Jacobs, Henry and Chubb. Just isnt happening."

2843,2020-09-05 16:10:02,in2hfg,"It is their final part of their dystopia trilogy. No news of handong involving in their upcoming comback (assume they just bring her back secretly or just bring her back very late that insomnias alredy expect that she will not be involved). Fans are sad and already kinda down, but nevertheless still excited for the last iteration of the trilogy that is titled ""utopia"".

Teasers drop and it doesn't look like anything utopia at all. Members are trapped in dark places and looks terrified. The tree is dying.

It's D-day, the mv drop half-way through, fans were surprised that they can here handongs voice, they are very happy about it, but there's no handong in any of the scene yet so they assumed that she only record the song. Throughout the dance scene of the mv we can see that the masked unnie is back. But surprisingly she actually takes part in the story, freeing the other members, reviving the tree and give them the happy end of utopia. Last scene where theyre all holding hands, standing infront of the tree this time. Camera zoom in towards the masked person as she's about to take it off, masked drop, no reveal but just a hard cut. Insomnias are curious...

Later that day, it's their first showcase they state that dongdong fortunately managed to record the song. In the new album also include a new version of scream and boca with handong vocals. Instead of performing their latest song first, they start off with scream as a sign of the begining of an era that they about to end. The perfomance went on very well. Performance end a little differently this time, the masked unnie is in the center front. She take off the masked. It's dongdong. Everybody went n.u.t.s. 

Idunno it's midnight here and this is just my wild imagination lol..."
2844,2020-09-05 18:07:43,in2hfg,"I never really thought I would see anything related to wrestling on here. Whenever I see the title Break the Wall, it always reminds me of Y2J. 

My story is heavily wrestling influenced. and kind of dumb. 

So they have their next comeback and The Show obviously had messed up the results again. After the results are announced, the lights go out and when they comeback up Masked Unnie, who is wearing hoodie so you can’t see her hair, has the producer by the collar. She delivers a pipe bomb moment burying The Show.  During the promo there are little hints of Handong. The girls are not completely sure who it is. Then she picks him up and choke slam him off of the stage through some tables. The camera follows her off stage and she takes off the hood allowing revealing the hair color. The camera pans to the rest of the girls and they have a shocked face because they figured out who it was. Then the screen cuts to black."
2845,2020-09-06 01:10:20,in2hfg,"Kane's original music and attire are my all time favorite character after Ministry Taker so I'm a simple person, have DC sample that or Finger Eleven's version and have Handong rap over it. Its DC they can do anything. And in this fantasy, WWE won't be hardasses about it and Vince himself books DC at a Raw show to perform all the wrestlers' entrances. 

Okay that got sidetracked [8] but still the Attitude Era brings out a really passionate side of me. Thank goodness for WWE Network. On the topic of Kane, anyone else remember that vicious chokeslam he did on Trish? Good lord. JR always gets me ""The height, the velocity"" when they play it in slowmo."
2846,2020-09-06 15:27:01,in2hfg,"Album 3 - Dystopia: Foundation has just been released.  Continuing along the lines of Break the Wall, this album is about cracking the foundation of the dystopia so that a new utopia may be started.  The title track is called Revelation.

The ladies have filmed the MV with the masked dancer returning only for the last 30 seconds or so of the video.  It ends with the current 6 in a V foundation and the masked dancer at rear center:

Dami                 Masked Dancer               Gahyeon  
Sua                             Yoohyeon  
JiU     Siyeon

In the video,. the MD takes off her mask to reveal a 2nd mask that has INSOMINA written across the forehead, showing that DC and Insomnia are needed to create the new world where good words are spoken.

The video does well, surpassing BOCA's popularity and gaining even more fans for the group.  Once again, at The Show, Insomnia is guardedly hopeful for a win but a few other groups recently released comebacks (Itzy - no-show, CLC, TXT, MCND).  After a few tense moments, DreamCatcher gets their first win for Revelation!  JiU tries to say a few words while blinking away her disbelief as Gahyeon bawls and Sua screams or tries to bite Siyeon.  Dami is, of course, quietly beaming while Yoohyeon has no idea what to do.  After teary-eyed JiU is done and the confetti is dropping, they try to re-enact the end of revelation in a relaxed, goofy way (typical DC style).  As they end their reenactment, the masked dancer removes her mask but it's not the Insomnia mask, it's Handong!  All of DC now cry as the confetti continues to fall.   
Their trophy is forgotten as the members and all of Insomnia acknowledge that the true win that evening isn't the shiny object handed to them by The Show but the reunification of the seven nightmares all under the same roof, ready to spread the dream together once again!  

<Fade to black>"
2847,2020-09-05 17:28:55,in2hfg,"I've always hoped they would do a scream reveal where Handong takes over the masked position, but is still wearing the mask. She could take over the part where Gahyeon is in the middle of them circling. OR she does the mask rap that Gahyeon does and pulls the mask down from herself."
2848,2020-09-05 16:37:51,in2hfg,That would be epic.

1. The 2nd amendment is about the right to protect yourself and your own property. Most Americans understand this. What you see in media is the few people who, either, are mentally ill, just as many as there are in Europe and everywhere else in the world, or those who  don't understand the safety around guns, not that shootings are caused by accidents but that they don't understand that guns should be a last resort for safety.

2. Voting for Trump might have been the best thing ever happening to the US. They realize what an idiot Trump can be and won't ever vote for such a person again. Though, Trump hasn't done only bad things, a lot of these isn't covered in mainstream media. These are the stuff that Trump supporters support him for. Most of them still understands that the way he handles a lot of things and what he says isn't the best for an American president. But again, it's the few crazy idiots who are covered in media.

3. Today, people get famous for doing stupid stuff.. Every country has those idiots.

4. Most of them are aware what's happening out in the world. Maybe not specifically your country, if you aren't American that is, but most of them are aware of a couple things happening in China, for example, a bit in Europe.. So on.

I think more people should be a bit sceptical about the media. Think this way: what's covered in media is somehow extraordinary. So if you see a lot of ""crazy Americans"" in media, maybe it's because these people are few and are doing things that is not normal in America. So what's normal, is what is NOT covered in media. And this goes for every country, at least in the western world. Also, the media controls quite a lot of how we should think. We humans are prone to follow others and if most of the media say to go left, most of us do without questioning the sources, the same goes for right."

2963,2020-09-04 20:16:47,im92c0,"I recommend listening to the first part of this WTF interview with ICE-T for anyone who gives the 'tough guy' fight to Covid-19.

https://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-1145-ice-t

Maybe if Cranston had succumbed or had a painful bout - it might have forced Adam to pivot. Unfortunately, the well off won't see the destruction because they never leave their bubble. (meaning their gated community).

I chuckle, because Adam thinks going back and forth from his warehouse to his house and back is him putting himself 'out there'."
2964,2020-09-04 12:51:21,im92c0,Bryan biting Adam's head off... Oof. This show is straight cringe.
2965,2020-09-04 05:27:43,im92c0,Jim Jefferies is terrible.
2966,2020-09-04 11:16:30,im92c0,Did Adam ask Geoff James Nugent (aka Jim Jeffries) how he came up with his stage name?
2967,2020-09-04 16:33:30,im92c0,"Ironically in the same episode that Bryan called him out and Adam got pissy, internalized nothing, and went straight back into his idiotic, ostrich-skin boots of a take."
2968,2020-09-05 00:28:55,im92c0,Dam.  Never thought about this.  So true. And he’d encourage even subservient talk.   “Sure thing boss man”.  Stopped listen in the spring.  What’s the latest with Ray?
2969,2020-09-04 11:17:02,im92c0,"I liked a couple days ago when he said ""cmon paint a picture with words buddy"" whe Adam was going on some rant about the wrong picture being pulled up"
2970,2020-09-04 15:18:34,im92c0,"Bryan is not getting fired.

I disagree with him on everything yet respect him challenging Adam, but he ain't getting fired"
2971,2020-09-07 18:18:43,im92c0,"Email around Christmas, most likely."
2972,2020-09-04 06:55:44,im92c0,"Why what happened? It'll be a few days (if ever) that I'll listen to this episode, I'm a couple weeks or more behind and keep starting an ep and bailing more frequently."
2973,2020-09-04 14:52:13,im92c0,"Adam has long been of the opinion that having a dead parent is much better than having a parent who's ""checked out""."
2974,2020-09-04 14:12:24,im92c0,"Also the electrician called in to agree with Ace is so pathetic. “Hey Ace I just wanted to call in to say, Veterans who talk about themselves are losers. I wish he died of corona”"
2975,2020-09-04 18:30:33,im92c0,"since he did this a day before that Trump/vets story broke, we can give Adam the benefit of the doubt that he truly looks down on vets and he isn't just saying that to copy Trump."
2976,2020-09-04 08:53:27,im92c0,Because the 70s is when his emotional and intellectual growth stopped.
2977,2020-09-07 22:41:20,im92c0,"More like his friend took pity on him and allowed him to submit some jokes, about 95% of which got cut, and the 5% that made it didn’t land."
2978,2020-09-05 16:15:25,im92c0,Adam wrote for Jimmy Kimmel - his production partner.
2979,2020-09-04 08:54:38,im92c0,Replace Adam with Ozzie
2980,2020-09-05 07:27:19,im92c0,"dr rhonda patrick went over this on JRE, that because of the link between Vitamin D and Covid. Blacks due to their increased melanin inhibit natural Vitamin D production from sunlight so they're simply at a higher chance of being vitamin deficient thus more likely to suffer more severe symptoms."
2981,2020-09-04 10:50:46,im92c0,"When i he’s his name, all I CNA think of is “Freedumb” and his opposition to #2A"
2982,2020-09-07 22:36:56,im92c0,Haven’t listened. What did Bryan call him out on?
2983,2020-09-04 21:28:11,im92c0,Is it coincidence that Adam berated the disabled veteran caller about the same time it was revealed that Trump referred to a bunch of veterans as “losers”?
2984,2020-09-04 07:19:57,im92c0,"Adam was digging in about the disabled veteran who called in yesterday and Bryan said, “Are we really the kind of show that makes fun of wounded veterans?” and Adam’s response was brief but dripping with disgust and you could just tell he’s over Bryan. And Bryan was doing the same yesterday. I think he is starting to hate the direction of the show. And he’s probably taking a lot of heat on social media for being a part of it. I mean, I’m not sure because I rented the Unibomber’s cabin after he got arrested so I don’t do much social media but I can imagine."
2985,2020-09-04 17:07:32,im92c0,"> Why what happened?

""Adam is Adam"""
2986,2020-09-04 12:51:26,im92c0,What day and time stamp was that comment?
2987,2020-09-04 15:20:19,im92c0,"I mean, not wanting to die is pretty selfish"
2988,2020-09-06 05:09:48,im92c0,Former production partner...
2989,2020-09-05 16:12:03,im92c0,"I don't think you are replying to the correct post.

My suggestion has nothing to do with vitamin deficiency.  You need to listen to WTF if interested."
2990,2020-09-04 17:11:42,im92c0,You having a stroke?
2991,2020-09-04 17:39:12,im92c0,Yeah man I wanted to defend Jim Jeffries here but what the hell am I supposed to say after that?
2992,2020-09-04 22:32:33,im92c0,How do you even know how to use the internet?
2993,2020-09-05 20:01:10,im92c0,"Stroke-to-Normal Translation: “When I see [or possibly ‘hear’] his name, all I can think of is [his comedy album] “Freedumb” and his opposition to the Second Amendment.”"
2994,2020-09-04 14:43:04,im92c0,"I thought the really brazen part was saying, “and Wah Wah Wubzy has been off the air for 10 fucking years!”    

You don’t attack Ace’s fresh content like that."
2995,2020-09-04 13:10:38,im92c0,"It's probably a good thing that the story about Trump calling McCain, POWs and KIA soldiers ""losers"" dropped too late for them to talk about it. He'd double down on that and... it wouldn't be good."
2996,2020-09-04 14:05:43,im92c0,"It only makes sense. I mean Bryan's wife clearly makes enough money that he doesn't have to work. Here's a guy that not terribly long ago was sure he was going to die of brain cancer. A brain cancer that has recently come out of remission, right? And his boss has reached the point that he's going to abandon basic human decency to fall in line with his right wing overlords and start calling people names for being disabled?

Given how close he came to dying young from a horrible form of cancer, I'd be surprised if he sticks with this dumpster fire any longer. Adam has very quickly gone from being willfully dense and ignorant to straight up being a piece of human garbage."
2997,2020-09-04 14:33:36,im92c0,[deleted]
2998,2020-09-08 00:46:18,im92c0,Isn't the Unibomber's cabin like utter fucking crap? I mean Lincoln is fine for what it is but hope you did some work.
2999,2020-09-04 13:16:34,im92c0,"It was about the 21:00 mark on today’s pod. That moment was truly cringy and Adam was taken aback. When Adam says “sorry ... can we move on?”  

I loved it.  Bryan isn’t going anywhere because as big an asshole as Adam can be, is he really going to get rid of a guy suffering with a brain tumor?"
3000,2020-09-05 07:20:53,im92c0,Oh good point! I forgot about that but you're right - Bryan did sound harsh AF when he said that.
3001,2020-09-04 15:49:26,im92c0,There's no bottom. Imagine feeling that jealous and weak that you have to disparage soldiers killed in action.
3002,2020-09-08 00:48:37,im92c0,"Bryan also makes money off of The Film Vault. They just did Top 5 sucklers because Anderson accuses Bryan of being a suckler all the time and talks shit about ""hairy man"" a lot. Oh and when their show was on the ACE network they made literally nothing and were expected to like it or some shit."
3003,2020-09-05 07:23:09,im92c0,"Well, maybe I live in Quantico..."
3004,2020-09-04 14:10:25,im92c0,Adam is such a pussy. The slightest disagreement with his line of thinking and he wants to change the subject.
3005,2020-09-04 17:16:01,im92c0,"two weeks later: ""Bryan is more of a 'lead guitar' kind of guy."
3006,2020-09-04 13:27:17,im92c0,"Thanks. I’m a novice and light weight Reddit user, but the times I ask questions here people have replied quickly with good info."
3007,2020-09-05 19:28:50,im92c0,Soldiers killed in action *100 years ago*.

3009,2020-09-05 20:32:31,im92c0,"No but I’ve been meaning to listen to that one! Guess now I will for sure, since I’m a complete narcissistic. Thanks for the reminder!"
3010,2020-09-04 04:55:38,im7cag,Oh shit - the number of A-listers testing + has me seriously concerned about the number of infected plebs...
3011,2020-09-04 09:25:57,im7cag,"He says they’re not political. But he shouldn’t have to. 

I don’t live in the states but seriously. Next you’re a communist for wearing a seatbelt? An anarchist if you don’t cut your own dick off?

This is people actively going against common sense. It’s time to grow up, seriously."

3015,2020-09-04 05:38:08,im7cag,Great hindsight Dwayne.
3016,2020-09-04 15:39:42,im7cag,"Okay so these rich people have every opportunity to stay safe, have food and supplies delivered, get home schooling/remote learning for their children... yet so many keep getting coronavirus..."
3017,2020-09-04 13:59:23,im7cag,Who knew going to the gym everyday was risky
3018,2020-09-04 17:47:20,im7cag,Of course he would... they use international stars and the blind love froM their moronic fan base to push politically motivated agendas... instill That fear deep within to have the cattle rushing in to be “vaccinated”.
3019,2020-09-04 14:10:54,im7cag,Dip shit Dwayne.
3020,2020-09-04 07:43:56,im7cag,"I mean the number of infected plebs is available too online, which it’s self is worrisome"
3021,2020-09-04 15:22:35,im7cag,I mean A listers usually have more people around them Because they’re famous or have a job that is around people acting
3022,2020-09-04 12:24:32,im7cag,It's not about common sense.  It's about being in an anti-science evangelical death cult.
3023,2020-09-04 17:58:20,im7cag,I made this exact same argument unfortunately to someone who swore the virus was overblown and not as bad as the media makes it and masks were political.
3024,2020-09-04 15:21:45,im7cag,"Why? It was just leftover pizza.

-Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson"
3025,2020-09-04 17:37:56,im7cag,Cuz they dumb
3026,2020-09-04 14:37:08,im7cag,"What, in his house?"
3027,2020-09-04 20:37:43,im7cag,Username doesn’t match the user. Definitely sound like a sheep.
3028,2020-09-05 14:34:43,im7cag,"Jesus Christ, you are dangerously stupid."
3029,2020-09-04 15:40:44,im7cag,Right?! Has all the money to afford not getting the virus and now endangered himself and children
3030,2020-09-04 08:04:52,im7cag,Yeah i check em now and then... the celeb infections just makes me feel like those numbers are low. Idk i just work here. :|
3031,2020-09-04 15:40:56,im7cag,I just picture that episode of Friends where Gary Oldman and Joey are working on a scene together and Oldman is just spitting his lines into Joey’s face. 6 feet ain’t gonna protect you from that.
3032,2020-09-04 13:53:54,im7cag,I guess the Rock will now be labeled as a child molester by QAnon for speaking truth and trying to be helpful
3033,2020-09-04 15:02:27,im7cag,People love playing a good telephone game
3034,2020-09-04 15:51:21,im7cag,No it’s about common sense.
3035,2020-09-05 14:37:54,im7cag,I could say the same for you... catch back up with your herd...
3036,2020-09-04 15:22:44,im7cag,Meanwhile he’ll be getting a raise from WWE for his honesty.
3037,2020-09-04 16:04:38,im7cag,common sense isn't a thing
3038,2020-09-05 21:48:44,im7cag,"Lmao you're so brilliant. Dwayne Johnson came out to tell everyone he has Corona and to be safe, so he could trick you into getting bill gates secret tracking vaccine, right? Just wanna make sure I'm keeping up with you're dillusional picture of reality."
3039,2020-09-05 22:01:18,im7cag,"In around about way yes possibly.. Dwayne John is an A list celebrity very high up on the totem pole.. with everything that is coming to light, and through testimonies of different documentaries and different sources.. it’s also been said you don’t get access to this kind of fame without playing ball. In other words “they own you” so if the powers that be told him you now have coronavirus well guess what he’s gonna do.. he’s goin to play ball. Dwayne Johnson has a very large fan base. So for those skeptical of lock downs and fighting against it.. let’s put a face on this the people can trust.. which is what they’ve done when using celebs to advocate masks and the social distancing etc. for a pandemic that’s such a threat to life all these A listers diagnosed with it have made miraculous recoveries.. but that’s gotta be a crazy assertion as well right? Either way you keep your closed minded mainstream all herded together sheep opinions.. and I’ll keep my something is definitely not right with what’s going on opinions.. and we can coexist just fine.. see and I did that without name calling."

3112,2020-10-09 23:05:20,j87pbk,"Why not?

I mean, this is the way I see it. Democracy would be a BETTER system, if we stopped putting, what seems to me, arbitrary guidelines on who can run for office. We're never going to get policies we want or government we want if keep narrowing down the types of people who are allowed to run for office.

I mean, people do NOT trust the government in the US. It's a big problem. Maybe the government should reflect the population more? Is the ""The Rock"" the best example of this? Maybe? I'm not sure, but I'm perfectly fine with a president that isn't Ivy League, Rich, White, Male...

I wouldn't mind a President or a Senate full of working class people. People who earn their Keep who aren't just born into privilege but who have earned their success and prosperity.

Does it mean we'll automatically agree with them?

I'd like, for once, for their to a President who was on welfare. Someone who understands the hardship and the violence of poverty. I won't suggest the Rock is this person. I'm not.

But I'm not interest in creating more stringent rules. I want to see some high school drop out, former welfare recipients and people who have gone to prison in government. People who understand the harder, darker side of society. Maybe they'll have some insight on how to fix some of these issues.

The Rock isn't any of these things that I'm advocating... but whenever the question of ""Who should run for President?"" comes up... my answer is ""Anyone who wants to who has good ideas!"""

3117,2020-10-09 13:56:07,j7yvfn,"Honestly, I would take out all of the 6th/7th round picks. How often does a 6th or 7th actually do anything in the NFL? That's the time to take fliers, because you really don't lose anything even if the player is complete ass. That's why you have seen teams cut their late round picks more and more before the season has started. 


Also, I would take off the players that have had some sort of issues outside of football like Telvin Smith, Blair Brown, and Reshard Greene. Keep in mind, Blair Brown and Telvin were both starters before they have had run ins with the law. And if I recall, Greene had some mishaps with the police either before or during his NFL career"
3118,2020-10-09 13:55:45,j7yvfn,You should do a couple other teams so we can benchmark where this is compared to the rest of the league
3119,2020-10-09 14:05:32,j7yvfn,"Bit surprised about some of those guys not being on rosters.  Joeckel was a starter still relatively recently.  So was Cyprien.  Gratz should be depth at least.  Ditto for Colvin, who went from our nickel corner to starting outside for the Texans, then nickel, then I guess BoB ruined him.  Brandon Allen was a backup recently.

Bowanko played through 2018.  Not terrible.  Looks like Bennett went to the Falcons, but suffered an ankle injury and ended up on IR.  Chris Smith would likely be on a roster, not practice squad, in a normal season.  I see the asterisk for Colvin... so yeah, same deal there.  Just an odd season.

We all know the deal with Telvin.

Ah.  Looks like Joeckel left the NFL to go back to school and pursue post-NFL life.  He'd probably be on a roster but seems to have decided the NFL's not for him.

Huh.  Actually looks like Cyprien's on a practice squad himself, for the 49ers.  He didn't want to be at first because it's a lot less money than he'd make on the active roster.  He suffered an ACL tear in 2018 that threw away that season and didn't get much chance to play in 2019.  So he's still around.

So in the first three rounds, the only guys who aren't active players are a guy who walked away but otherwise might still have been a starter; a guy who's on a practice squad and had his career derailed by ACL; and a CB who had a few years in the league but, well, CB is a crazy position.  It's not really that bad of a list, especially considering how many spots there are realistically for guys to go into, and that some of the guys would still be playing here if not for Coughlin's involvement in contracts."
3120,2020-10-09 15:10:30,j7yvfn,"Feel like Telvin should be an exception here. Surprised Allen isn't a backup, he had one good start for the Broncos??"

3131,2020-10-09 16:26:39,j7yvfn,"He's 'solid' when he's on monster lines that include Calais, Yannick, Malik, Aaron Donald, brockers and he can collect a handful of cleanup/free rush sacks. He has never been a line up and beat the opposing tackle player. 

And now that he is one of the featured pass rushers on a team he is getting exposed as the sucky player he is."
3132,2020-10-10 16:43:43,j7yvfn,"He's not a good feature pass-rusher, but he's a really good complementary piece. It's why he had the numbers he did last year with the Rams, because he was just really good at helping out. He's not going to straight-up bully opposing lines, but if someone else can command premier attention he can get some work done. He didn't live up to top-3 billing, but he isn't trash. It just kind of stings because 3 rounds later we could have gotten Frank Clark."
3133,2020-10-10 03:56:24,j7yvfn,"This is butthurt jags fan at its finest.

Every good pass rusher plays on a line with good players. Thats how it works, thats why you ""build"" a line and thats why you ""build"" a team.

Fowler, Yannick, Campbell were all good line players who collectively become great. 

Its not the draft picks, its running them out of the team because you a dysfunctional organization."
3134,2020-10-10 13:48:25,j7yvfn,"Nah, it's just objectivism. I have watched Yannick whip up on some LTs to the tune of 3 sacks and 2 forced fumbles (I have Cook and Jefferson on my dynasty team so I watch a lot of Vikings). Campbell is still a monster against the run that causes pressure and havoc without necessarily piling up the sacks for himself. 

Neither of them are still Jags but you just watch them and they are still very productive at what they do (Yannick is still not good against the run). Fowler is just baaaad at everything."

3136,2020-10-09 05:16:28,j7sd0i,"Phil Jackson - I used to be with you on Phil Jackson but I’ve changed my mind on him. A few reasons why. 

Yes he had amazingly talented teams, especially at the Bulls. He also managed those superstars very well. That’s no small task. Part of it was his off the court presence to manage multiple superstar egos. That’s not an Xs and Os skill but is a major part of coaching in the NBA. 

Speaking of Xs and Os, his use of the triangle offense was perfect for his superstar teams. It gets the full team involved. Yes Jordan put the team on his shoulders sometimes but that’s because the full team was engaged in their triangle offense. 

Threepeats  the last three teams to three peat were all coached by Jackson. Sustaining excellence is not easy and Jackson did it 3 times. Yes he had talented teams but the Bulls were also going against maybe one of the best teams to never win a title in the Stockton and Malone Jazz. Yes Jordan was the GOAT but Stockton and Malone are all time greats that played together and were much better than anyone else on the Bulls. The triangle offense Jackson allowed Jordan and his teammates to do something really special."
3137,2020-10-09 04:50:59,j7sd0i,"A large part of coaching/managing a team is to manage the egos, especially when you have many star players on the same teams as you've referenced. I think that's one of the hallmarks that separates mediocre and great coaches, more so than the X's and O's of whichever sport."

3139,2020-10-09 06:27:06,j7sd0i,"Michael Jordan, Kareem, Kobe, Shaq, all overrated. They were carried by good coaching, schemes, and supporting casts. They’d be nothing without Phil Jackson and Pay Riley. They’d all be Charles Barkleys."
3140,2020-10-09 06:35:47,j7sd0i,"Kyrie said recently that it doesn't matter who his teams coach is, and he thinks the earth is flat."
3141,2020-10-11 07:47:52,j7sd0i,"Phil Jackson is a master motivator. Both Kobe and MJ have said so. They said that his advice helped him in the mental aspects of the game. If they both say so, who are you to disagree? Having great players may mean you win a lot, but it doesn't make you a great coach, especially if you can't get your talent to play, a la Johnny Davis and Iverson or Doc Rivers and Rondo."
3142,2020-10-09 13:42:11,j7sd0i,"I agree with you on nearly everything ... except the 96 World Series

I think that series was emblematic of decisions that couldn't have been made with spreadsheets and sabermetrics, nor could have been made by a random fan putting superstars in the lineup and letting them do what they do.  

Torre sat a slumping Wade Boggs in favor of Charlie Hayes.  Not to insult the guy, he wasn't a horrible player or anything, but would anyone even remember Charlie Hayes's career if he didn't catch the final out?  

Played an injured Paul ONeil (strained hamstring if I recall correctly?)

Handling the 1B situation in the DH-less games.  Remember he had Cecil Fielder and Tino Martinez.  Tough call as to who to go to.  I'd be interested to find out if the sabermetrics would have suggested a different call in that situation."
3143,2020-10-09 16:53:59,j7sd0i,"The NBA is a player’s league, so the most important coaching attribute there is, is to get players to buy in. 

Other than that, I don’t know how to really argue against your assertion because it’s so subjective. Who knows if the lakers should have won 3/4/5 titles under riley. It’s tough to parse all that out in basketball."
3144,2020-10-09 18:50:23,j7sd0i,"So you could literally make this argument against any coach that was the head of a “dynasty”.  You’re not having a dynasty without a great roster.  With that being said, have you ever coached or played athletics at a high level? I don’t ask these things to be demeaning, I ask because it completely changes your perspective on things.  I grew up a coaches kid and a gym rat.  I cannot watch certain sports the same as any other casual viewer.

Joe Schmo wouldn’t be able to just put superstars out there and win games."
3145,2020-10-09 19:58:14,j7sd0i,"There are some coaches who are really good at making mediocre teams great, and there are some coaches who are really good at making bad teams decent. Then there are coaches whose skillset lies in making great teams into dynasties. It's a rare coach who can do more than one of those. 

I don't know too much about basketball, but I can talk baseball. For the first example, the manager who gets a team over the hump from playoff team to WS winner, look at Tony LaRussa or Terry Francona. These guys are, essentially, hot-shotters, guys who will lay off players during the regular season but get the most out of them in a short series. For the second type, it's Dusty Baker, a guy who frequently made rebuilding teams better than they were by being a teacher type. And then there's Joe Torre, a real laid-back guy who lets players do as they please. 

So what you need is the right manager for the right situation. If, say, the Yankees had kept Buck Showalter, who was more in the LaRussa mold, they probably would have won in 1999 and 2000, but in 1998 when they were down 2-1 in the ALCS, that's where a guy like that can have the team too on edge. Or when they were down 2-0 in the 1996 World Series. A guy like Baker would have just caused tension in the locker room, where you'd have guys like Bernie Williams and Andy Pettite who probably wouldn't have put up with him."
3146,2020-10-11 07:48:44,j7sd0i,"If Jordan hadn't been forced to retire, the Bulls would have won 8 in a row, possibly 9."
3147,2020-10-11 07:48:55,j7sd0i,"If Jordan hadn't been forced to retire, the Bulls would have won 8 in a row, possibly 9."
3148,2020-10-09 05:35:22,j7sd0i,"I know the triangle offense was designed to maximize the talent, you're right on that. I'll have to really consider this one for a few. He did top Malone and Stockton, and I hadn't really thought about that, although I remember watching. 

I don't know, I'm really hung up on the three of them never elevating medium-talent teams, but Jackson never had the chance until he was the Knicks team president. While his personnel decisions were terrible, he wasn't coaching, so his philosophies weren't tested out. 

I don't know, I'm really mulling this one over, especially based on the Stockton and Malone argument. Tomjanovich won back to back with the Rockets, defeating a couple of great times of the times in the Magic and the Knicks, but he isn't considered a great. Granted, though, he didn't demonstrate the sustained success.

I'm considering this one for a delta right now. Give me some time to think it over. I work night shift, so all I have is time tonight.

Thought about it, and I'll give you a delta for Phil Jackson, although I still consider him to be somewhat overrated.

Δ"
3149,2020-10-09 05:03:49,j7sd0i,"I agree with that, and I did consider that as a counter-argument. But when the teams experienced adversity, none of the coaches could manage the personalities very effectively, IMO. Everyone gets along when they're winning, but when times got hard or difficult, I don't think these coaches were up to the task.

When Jordan went and played baseball, Phil Jackson couldn't get Scottie Pippen to go into the game in the playoffs because Pippen was mad he wasn't getting the last shot. When he was with the Lakers, Kobe got him forced out, and he couldn't manage to find a balance between Kobe and Shaq.

Joe Torre could never seem to get the most out of Alex Rodriguez, and he never found success outside of that all-star cast, regardless of how well he balanced the personalities.

Pat Riley couldn't win without superstars, and sometimes even with stars. While he never faced a lot of locker room strife, he was not successful in elevating mid-tier talent to improve itself.

You can't understand how much it pains me to say this, as a New York sports fan, but Bill Belichick managed to make great careers for a lot of mediocre players. He got Ryan Mallett, Jacoby Brissett, Matt Cassell and Jimmy Garoppolo to be regarded as solid backups, and only Garopollo has found anything approaching success elsewhere. His receivers tend to be the same story. 

None of these coaches got more out of their players than their abilities would necessarily allow. Torre was so notoriously hard on his pitching staff, running them into the ground by riding the hot hand, that they had to put special rules in place when younger talent came up, like Joba Chamberlain."
3150,2020-10-09 06:24:23,j7sd0i,"Well, I wasn't saying he wasn't a leader. That wasn't the argument that I made. I just don't think he was an all-time great coach. I think if you put Larry Brown, Jeff Van Gundy, Rudy Tomjanovich or some of the other prominent coaches of the time in his place, they would have won those same championships with the personnel he fielded.

I think Phil Jackson being in this group is what is getting responses. No one seems to be bringing up Riley or Torre."
3151,2020-10-09 06:34:44,j7sd0i,"I don't know. I remember Michael Jordan hanging 63 points on the Knicks in a single game, putting the team on his back. No one could ever guard Kareem effectively against his sky hook. Kobe could be selfish, and managing him was a job in and of itself. But Shaq brought 3 separate teams to the finals in the Magic, the Lakers, and then the Heat. I think those players elevated the coaching. Karl Malone was already a great when he came to the Lakers, like Gary Payton and Steve Nash, and Jackson couldn't get them to sync up in harmony with that offense."
3152,2020-10-10 02:22:28,j7sd0i,"I was a pistons fan back in the day and hated the Bulls. At this point in my life, I think he was a good coach but since many people call him the greatest coach ever, yeah I’m down with saying that he was good but he is somewhat overrated."

I just always felt he was full of crap, that Jordan got him the rings (he never won with the Bulls without Jordan). When he speaks, for me, it comes across as high-handed.

Win/win. I oversold in a trade today to get Tom Brady before a QB1 season because I knew that I’d be able to recover with what was available at WR in the wires and what I needed to patch my WR4 sized hole from trading Lamb.

3172,2020-10-09 02:26:40,j7ltgh,Not bad since the USA has 360mm people
3173,2020-10-09 13:22:33,j7ltgh,"Republicans “Celebrities need to stay out of politics. No one wants to hear their opinions”

Also Republicans: elect actors and reality show hosts"
3174,2020-10-09 04:19:40,j7ltgh,"All I kept getting was people drinking his tequila on my feed, so I unfollowed him."
3175,2020-10-09 12:44:46,j7ltgh,That’s 47th President of the United States Dwayne Johnson to you Jabroni.
3176,2020-10-09 13:39:16,j7ltgh,People need to stop treating celebrities like their not human if they endorse they endorse as long as they aren’t doing anything illegal with the votes/endorsement there’s nothing to bitch about
3177,2020-10-09 03:22:10,j7ltgh,"Go Joe!  Thank you Mr. Johnson.  VOTE VOTE VOTE!  We can vote, we will vote!"
3178,2020-10-09 12:38:54,j7ltgh,What can’t the Rock do?
3179,2020-10-09 04:48:51,j7ltgh,I admire his stamina but he should probably get tested
3180,2020-10-09 04:01:24,j7ltgh,good job dwayne johnson
3181,2020-10-09 12:29:16,j7ltgh,Lol all the MAGAts crying now
3182,2020-10-09 12:32:23,j7ltgh,Trump is the leader of domestic terrorists
3183,2020-10-09 14:54:38,j7ltgh,#DumpTheTurdNov3rd
3184,2020-10-09 15:30:31,j7ltgh,Lol all these trumptards screaming for celebrities to stay out of politics when their dumbass president was a D list reality star. The hypocrisy is stunning.
3185,2020-10-09 17:18:17,j7ltgh,Trump’s supporters are the American Isis terrorists
3186,2020-10-09 13:45:05,j7ltgh,"Don’t be a jabroni, vote out this phony!"
3187,2020-10-09 15:46:12,j7ltgh,That’s my rock right there!! 😍
3188,2020-10-09 05:35:38,j7ltgh,More votes than Trump will get.
3189,2020-10-09 06:28:16,j7ltgh,Anyone else wants to watch The Rock vs Trump in a steel cage match?
3190,2020-10-09 06:13:58,j7ltgh,Dan Bongino looks like Korvo created a Funbucket 2 version of Dwayne Johnson
3191,2020-10-09 09:44:10,j7ltgh,Considering he could turn a trump supporter into a human pretzel so they would be hard pressed to criticize him in person. Unfollowing him on social media would be the safer option.
3192,2020-10-09 14:54:14,j7ltgh,That’s great news. I’m tired of people crapping on other people just because they don’t agree with there political opinions. It’s kind of funny that people don’t want politics in there media but we all know they would be happy if there politics were involved in media like with the NFL and the NBA. We all know that if the people complaining “we don’t want politics in sports” would be happy if there politics were in the NBA and other Sports.
3193,2020-10-09 16:41:52,j7ltgh,At first I thought Rock was just a new Hulk Hogan. This dude is a class act and all around good guy.
3194,2020-10-09 17:10:13,j7ltgh,"lol the people who complain about celebrities putting their voice in, are only upset when celebrities voice their opinion for someone on the opposite spectrum. But when celebrities vouch for their political advocate they are praised. It’s kinda sad."
3195,2020-10-09 09:44:36,j7ltgh,Can you smell what the rock is ...........
3196,2020-10-09 09:58:13,j7ltgh,That is not a flattering image
3197,2020-10-09 10:35:56,j7ltgh,Dwayne: “What can I say except your welcome!”
3198,2020-10-09 13:12:25,j7ltgh,"it doesn’t matter who wins, our truth will be silenced because tyranny loves to make victims. not citizens."
3199,2020-10-09 15:35:55,j7ltgh,oh my god stop that’s not what top means oh god
3200,2020-10-09 16:56:31,j7ltgh,"The alternative is voting trump. So even if Hitler came back to life and ran for president, you'd better vote Hitler."
3201,2020-10-09 16:58:26,j7ltgh,"Is that dwayne in the thumbnail?

He looks like jeff bezos deepfaked to dwayne"
3202,2020-10-09 17:01:41,j7ltgh,Let’s have a civil discussion... why are you guys voting for Biden?
3203,2020-10-09 18:50:32,j7ltgh,Dwayne Johnson for PRESIDENT 2024-2025
3204,2020-10-09 18:51:27,j7ltgh,I would vote for him.
3205,2020-10-09 19:11:45,j7ltgh,Johnson gets it. He really doesn’t care if he loses Klout or not. He just wants the right thing done.
3206,2020-10-09 23:59:36,j7ltgh,The People’s Champ!  🏆🥇
3207,2020-10-10 00:47:13,j7ltgh,Why is he dressed like a high-end waiter in the pic?
3208,2020-10-10 04:18:07,j7ltgh,"The Rock for prez, 2028."
3209,2020-10-10 05:47:40,j7ltgh,Okay so can you donate some money wit his friends....
3210,2020-10-13 13:58:41,j7ltgh,Cool but that’s a pretty bad picture of the Rock.
3211,2020-10-09 07:29:16,j7ltgh,Funny how all the sensible people just so happen to support not agent orange
3212,2020-10-09 09:11:01,j7ltgh,Why is this a news story
3213,2020-10-09 08:39:04,j7ltgh,"I mean he’s a none-white Hollywood actor, what made people think he was supporting Trump in the first place?"
3214,2020-10-09 11:57:27,j7ltgh,[removed]
3215,2020-10-09 14:29:53,j7ltgh,From rock to pebble.
3216,2020-10-09 16:07:40,j7ltgh,China has lots of citizens.
3217,2020-10-09 17:19:01,j7ltgh,That is the most unbecoming photo I’ve ever seen of him.
3218,2020-10-09 17:38:30,j7ltgh,"Uh oh, don’t get too popular Dwayne, Republicans may try to elect you next"
3219,2020-10-09 17:38:57,j7ltgh,Damn he’s looking OLD in this pic
3220,2020-10-09 18:10:12,j7ltgh,"Thats the problem, there is no “your” truth. There is truth and lies."
3221,2020-10-09 18:49:23,j7ltgh,If only what he thought mattered
3222,2020-10-09 18:57:05,j7ltgh,Wait but he only has 80 thousand followers...? What am I missing?
3223,2020-10-09 19:04:43,j7ltgh,Hahaha noice political move there. If Trump had paid him more he would have endorsed him.
3224,2020-10-09 19:32:31,j7ltgh,who’s surprised 99% of Hollywood is left asf
3225,2020-10-09 20:17:01,j7ltgh,"if i want tips on hgh and roid abuse, ill ask the people's champion , otherwise, only an uninformed socialist drone would vote  for sleepy Joe."
3226,2020-10-09 20:44:22,j7ltgh,"Just tried it myself, now I got 200k followers as well. Truly incredible!"
3227,2020-10-09 23:17:08,j7ltgh,This should be posted under suddenly gay.
3228,2020-10-09 23:24:34,j7ltgh,"I really don’t understand why people put any weight on people like him endorsing anybody? To my knowledge, he has no background in politics or policies."
3229,2020-10-10 02:58:06,j7ltgh,Yeah great endorse a pediphile
3230,2020-10-10 07:14:03,j7ltgh,"His account grows organically by about 5000 a day passively. You could also say his account topped that many followers after posting a picture of a pancake, an item which is probably about as coherent as the Democratic nominee."
3231,2020-10-09 06:11:28,j7ltgh,That photo looks like a cross between Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel.
3232,2020-10-09 09:28:28,j7ltgh,"I frankly think he’s the man. Well, A man. But an important voice speaking out about a generational inflection point in the way we can live our lives in health and peace. He has a platform, and  as so totally opposed to all the ugly, vile, diminishing platforms I have seen, I think he spoke from the heart and spoke quite well"
3233,2020-10-09 11:05:39,j7ltgh,"200 million. If they all voted, it would change the world."
3234,2020-10-09 05:41:50,j7ltgh,"I gotta say I really can't picture him as a neo-liberal, he strikes me as center to center right given his personality"
3235,2020-10-09 06:12:39,j7ltgh,I’m really sorry but this is such an unsettling picture of him. He’s such an attractive guy but man he looks so awkward here lol
3236,2020-10-09 05:39:21,j7ltgh,he made the right choice but if people are voting based on who their favorite wrestler thinks is a good president we are fucked as a country
3237,2020-10-09 07:05:27,j7ltgh,Jesus this comment section is an absolute joke.
3238,2020-10-09 07:40:21,j7ltgh,“Your truth” that’s an opinion...
3239,2020-10-09 14:09:18,j7ltgh,And so pandering to the public does win the popularity contest. High school never ends.
3240,2020-10-09 14:55:17,j7ltgh,It’s sad to see celebrities not endorsing other parties. It’s as if they’re getting paid to endorse only democratic candidates or something. 🤔
3241,2020-10-09 05:22:16,j7ltgh,I always vote based on my favorite celeb.
3242,2020-10-09 07:32:58,j7ltgh,[removed]
3243,2020-10-09 08:48:43,j7ltgh,"I don’t follow any “celebrity”. For me, being famous is hardly ever interesting."
3244,2020-10-09 11:53:12,j7ltgh,I’m praying we don’t experience an election where he runs for president because a lot of people apparently want that
3245,2020-10-09 13:52:22,j7ltgh,So 100 million plus kids who can't even vote now follow the rock. Good to know.
3246,2020-10-09 05:06:20,j7ltgh,How about just speak THE truth rather than YOUR truth?
3247,2020-10-09 14:44:08,j7ltgh,He just lost my respec.. celebs shd keep pllitical views to themseleve or risk loosing fans
3248,2020-10-09 15:04:07,j7ltgh,"More billionaires support democrats via donations than rebugs, billionaires own the democrat party.

So why is it surprising that wealthy celebs would be endorsing the party of the wealthy?

Source: Forbes study of campaign donations thus far..."
3249,2020-10-09 15:06:11,j7ltgh,"Get woke, go broke"
3250,2020-10-09 15:14:46,j7ltgh,"I'm all for celebrities to use their platform for politics....I just think it should go both ways. Unfortunately, being a conservative in Hollywood is a death blow, so most Trump supporters will keep to themselves."
3251,2020-10-09 15:46:45,j7ltgh,"Another shrewd capitalist move by the rock then, now he can charge even more for each of his paid stories, seeing as he’s already the highest paid celeb on IG at over 1 million USDs per placement, I guess he figured the endorsement would produce a net gain after he ran it by his PR team and they calculated it would work out a good business move. 

Well done suckers, you’re making him even richer lol. I’m sure he won’t be socialising his wealth anytime soon. 

Smart man 👍"
3252,2020-10-08 23:01:54,j7ltgh,"Who gives a shit how many followers he has?

This isn't news."
3253,2020-10-09 06:18:12,j7ltgh,"Funny how Biden/Harris are pretty much responsible for our “justice system” guess the rock didn’t pay much attention to Biden’s 94 crime bill, and Harris keeping black Americans locked up after release time for cheap prison California labor"

3256,2020-10-09 11:43:15,j7ltgh,Honestly though who gives a shit who the rock enforces
3257,2020-10-09 11:59:16,j7ltgh,Steroids are bad
3258,2020-10-09 05:27:59,j7ltgh,"I think he did this out of necessity. Hollywood would have blackballed the shit out of him if he said he’d chose somebody else, if anyone at all. Celebrities are paid to pretend for a living, I take whatever bullshit they say they claim to be in favor of with a grain of salt."
3259,2020-10-09 03:48:19,j7ltgh,Why would he want Joe Biden as POTUS?
3260,2020-10-09 00:36:18,j7ltgh,[removed]
3261,2020-10-09 10:38:57,j7ltgh,If you need a celebrity to tell you to vote/who to vote for you’re a moron. It away comes off as super condescending when they post about tell you why it’s important to vote/who to vote for. And that goes for all celebrities. Not just ones telling you to vote Biden but the ones telling you to vote trump too. But apparently a bunch of weird people like this? Idk
3262,2020-10-09 12:37:50,j7ltgh,"Yes, ""Speak your truth"" 

As long as your truth is approved and falls in line with what we want you to think."
3263,2020-10-09 06:14:46,j7ltgh,Ugh sooo gross. What a disappointment
3264,2020-10-09 09:24:27,j7ltgh,Worth a lot more coming from Rocky because he’s traditionally been a sensible moderate. Unlike most celebrity endorsements - which come from deranged leftists like most of Hollywood.
3265,2020-10-09 13:04:36,j7ltgh,New meaning to “dumb as a rock”
3266,2020-10-09 03:04:41,j7ltgh,“gO WoKe gO bRoKe!!!1!”
3267,2020-10-09 04:40:15,j7ltgh,Weird how they only want celebrities to stay out of politics if it just goes against their politics.
3268,2020-10-09 05:13:39,j7ltgh,It’s crazy how so many people were like “I use to have respect for you” like he would care. This man has lived his whole life working hard and earned his respect a thousand times over.
3269,2020-10-09 13:40:53,j7ltgh,"My biggest thing is regardless of your political beliefs, expecting someone to not use a platform that they have makes zero sense to me. Like very tired of “stick to sports, movies, etc.” I can almost promise that people complaining have used some type of platform in life to promote themselves or their ideas forward before."
3270,2020-10-09 12:45:32,j7ltgh,"I really want a celebrity to come out and endorse Trump, then a minute or two later go “Just kidding, Biden” and watch all the hypocritical conservatives bitch."
3271,2020-10-09 13:26:39,j7ltgh,Had a friend of mine find out he endorsed Joe... He immediately unfollowed him. Like okay buddy I’m sure Dwayne is going to miss your follow
3272,2020-10-09 16:04:00,j7ltgh,"Amazing that a man who is arguably the biggest movie star in the planet and has spoken at the republican national convention in the past can’t endorse the train wreck they have as president. 

Don’t you think that should be a wake up call to his party ?"
3273,2020-10-09 21:33:49,j7ltgh,"Jabronis will jabroni.

Know your role!"
3274,2020-10-09 22:37:51,j7ltgh,I really really hate trumpers.
3275,2020-10-09 11:27:35,j7ltgh,I mean honestly why should you care about Hollywood endorsing a candidate? I am not switching to Hanes underwear just because Michael Jordan endorsed it.
3276,2020-10-09 16:16:12,j7ltgh,"I think The Rock himself said it best in what I believe is his greatest quote: “Shut up, bitch!”"
3277,2020-10-09 16:57:14,j7ltgh,"The “silent majority” really isn’t. Trump supporters are a sad, angry, dying minority. But they vote."
3278,2020-10-09 17:22:41,j7ltgh,Or the sad sad saaad endorsement of Clint Eastwood
3279,2020-10-09 17:40:07,j7ltgh,"I never understood people telling celebs and athletes to stay out of political conversations.  Meanwhile, we have millions of ignorant people on social media thinking it’s just fine to chime in.  Can’t have it both ways.  Either we all have a voice or none of us do.

“Shut up and dribble”?  Oh okay Steve, from accounting, why don’t you shut up and do your paperwork."
3280,2020-10-09 13:26:48,j7ltgh,It’s funny to think the followers he got can vote. Most of the “new” followers are most likely 10 year olds. While the ones who left are of voting age.
3281,2020-10-09 17:00:57,j7ltgh,Let’s have a civil discussion. Why are you voting for Biden?
3282,2020-10-09 18:48:18,j7ltgh,"Do you even know The Rock as a person? 
The right wing made him famous before he got into movies and then everyone made him ultra famous. Famous people feel the need to speak out and use the platform they have been given. I would and you would too. If you had that platform are you wouldn’t use that to push out your personal beliefs that you hold dear? I don’t believe The Rock spoke out against trump or sad anything about him at all to suddenly hate the him for voting for Biden. 

If China suddenly attacked our shores you better bet your ass this country would unite like we did on 9/11. We need a leader we can unite under and Joe nor Trump are the men for the job."
3283,2020-10-09 05:47:39,j7ltgh,"After trump, I’m never trusting a Republican again. He made me realize how much they outright lie."
3284,2020-10-09 15:03:08,j7ltgh,But the rock has BILLIONS AND BILLIONS of fans
3285,2020-10-13 14:06:32,j7ltgh,I guess technically he could have lost a bunch of followers but just swapped that group for a larger group of new followers. I don’t know how they would know that information though.
3286,2020-10-09 09:36:57,j7ltgh,"And even if he did, so what, what impact would losing 5 million followers have to his career or life, none at all. And also who TF would want a bunch of racists following them anyway .  I mean swap out 5 million for 5 obvs."
3287,2020-10-09 06:45:29,j7ltgh,"Well, in theory, they both could be right. He could have lost millions, and gained many more millions, making both statements correct."
3288,2020-10-09 08:03:38,j7ltgh,[deleted]
3289,2020-10-09 13:27:25,j7ltgh,Saw this with Taylor Swift and Pink. Both are actively endorsing Biden and being told to stick to singing or their singing isn’t that good. So tell me again why republicans call us rude and heartless?
3290,2020-10-09 13:41:49,j7ltgh,And vice versa...
3291,2020-10-09 07:41:08,j7ltgh,.....that reaction is the same for both sides
3292,2020-10-09 14:55:24,j7ltgh,"And how do Biden supporters react when a celebrity endorses trump?

“Omg, I always knew this guy was a racist!”"
3293,2020-10-09 05:03:12,j7ltgh,"There’s plenty of people in the world outside of America that would follow Dwayne, so maybe take it with a grain of salt and get out there and vote like your life depends on it. It very likely does."
3294,2020-10-09 14:30:53,j7ltgh,Two hundred million pairs of eyeballs checking what he says and does every single day. The mind boggles at the reach that gives him.
3295,2020-10-13 14:07:46,j7ltgh,Those are some pretty short people. That’s like 36 cm.
3296,2020-10-09 07:57:26,j7ltgh,Are they metric?

3298,2020-10-09 19:36:41,j7ltgh,Celwbrities should stay out of politics when they are just that. When Trump and reagan ran for president they became full time politicians. I wouldn’t give two fucks about what Trump thought if he was just another celebrity
3299,2020-10-09 11:59:07,j7ltgh,"You’re not wrong, he’s a promotion/business machine. Almost any post he makes has a purpose"
3300,2020-10-09 08:45:15,j7ltgh,"Salty boy, cant make his own tequila. Don't hate lol"
3301,2020-10-09 07:40:13,j7ltgh,Vote now vote early
3302,2020-10-09 23:38:04,j7ltgh,Beat paper
3303,2020-10-09 05:04:53,j7ltgh,"He had corona virus about a month ago, along with many of his family members. I hope he’s doing better"
3304,2020-10-09 04:49:20,j7ltgh,good day joe dawson
3305,2020-10-09 06:36:33,j7ltgh,"200,000,000 is more votes than anyone will get since only 255,000,000 Americans are of voting age."
3306,2020-10-09 07:33:23,j7ltgh,It would end quick
3307,2020-10-09 16:26:10,j7ltgh,"Yes, with all those photoshops of muscular Trump instead of his actual bloated, frail, pale, geriatric self.   He’s probably disintegrate with the first punch."
3308,2020-10-09 13:28:20,j7ltgh,I’d rather see the rock pummel Biden
3309,2020-10-09 17:37:55,j7ltgh,You are what’s wrong with America
3310,2020-10-09 18:51:15,j7ltgh,Biden has foreign policy experience and is a better diplomat.
3311,2020-10-09 14:03:08,j7ltgh,"He’s the highest paid actor in the world. Some wealthy people support Republicans because they want to keep more of the money they’ve made, and pay lower taxes. Johnson’s endorsement shows that for him, saving that small percentage isn’t worth the price we pay in our conscience."
3312,2020-10-09 18:14:47,j7ltgh,This is the entertainment subreddit. Are you expecting hard hitting journalism?
3313,2020-10-09 09:59:38,j7ltgh,"lots of very wealthy people, regardless of identity, support trump because of his tax cuts for their income bracket."

I think it’s kinda cute"
3317,2020-10-09 17:36:01,j7ltgh,"Have you ever seen his classic fannypack wearing, arm on a tissue pose."
3318,2020-10-09 06:26:32,j7ltgh,Joe is center right in world politics so...
3319,2020-10-09 06:39:04,j7ltgh,What do you think neo-liberals are...
3320,2020-10-09 07:28:15,j7ltgh,He says he’s liberal but with a bit of conservative values
3321,2020-10-09 13:13:24,j7ltgh,"Well he is a actually a Republican (or was), but voting out Trump has honestly transcended political leaning alone at this point."
3322,2020-10-09 15:35:03,j7ltgh,There are plenty of us who are center to center right who still won’t vote for Trump.
3323,2020-10-09 06:06:25,j7ltgh,The country can’t be any more fucked supporting “their favourite wrestler” as it when people elected their favourite reality TV host as president.
3324,2020-10-09 07:27:34,j7ltgh,You know there’s a lot of people who don’t give a shit that he was a wrestler right? Or even know him for that.
3325,2020-10-09 09:38:48,j7ltgh,Mate that ship has long since sailed
3326,2020-10-09 10:44:09,j7ltgh,Our “President” now wears orange clown makeup.
3327,2020-10-09 14:00:56,j7ltgh,"Do you purposely spread lies, or just accidentally believe them?"
3328,2020-10-09 09:58:51,j7ltgh,"Is this even true? As far I’m concerned the federal  tax rate for him goes back to 39, from 37. His California state income tax should remain the same, and he makes sooooo much money that 2 percent isn’t really shit lol. Now if this was Bernie sanders I could see his taxes being insane but not so much with Biden. Biden def has some things that are wrong with him but his tax policy is fair to all and really goes after corporate America as opposed to singular wealthy individuals"
3329,2020-10-09 14:03:32,j7ltgh,Trump got elected because he’s a celebrity.
3330,2020-10-09 07:20:00,j7ltgh,this is why you have 8 downvotes
3331,2020-10-09 16:55:05,j7ltgh,“Celebs should keep political views to themselves” lmao trump and Reagan were both in the entertainment industry before they became president

James Woods

3333,2020-10-09 19:06:30,j7ltgh,Definitely smart. This is what elites do. Play whatever political system fills their pockets

3337,2020-10-09 19:05:46,j7ltgh,I don’t know why you’re getting downvoted when it’s a fact what Harris did and public record. Sad
3338,2020-10-09 04:36:35,j7ltgh,You realize Trumps best friend is Vince McMahon. They have all met Donald personally. My friend worked as a writer for the WWE and had to sit thru some meetings with Donald. Can confirm he’s a giant piece of shit.
3339,2020-10-09 03:31:13,j7ltgh,Trump is literally a failed business man that somehow got elected. It would be ironic to claim celebrities have no place in politics.
3340,2020-10-09 03:50:49,j7ltgh,"He has a right to express himself just like any other person, regardless of his profession or status."

Who do consider worthy of taking advice from?"
3343,2020-10-09 04:36:10,j7ltgh,"you know trump is in the pro wrestling HOF, right?"
3344,2020-10-09 04:12:45,j7ltgh,Fun fact- Donald Trump is in the WWE Hall of Fame.
3345,2020-10-09 13:24:33,j7ltgh,You seem to care.
3346,2020-10-09 06:11:21,j7ltgh,"I think may be onto something. Being a celebrity that supports Trump is a bad career move (mostly due on how awful Trump is). A little Googling finds Dwayne in this pro-life website.

https://www.texasrighttolife.com/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-calls-his-friend-with-down-syndrome-the-rocks-rock/

Now the question is can you be pro-life and support a Biden/Harris ticket??"
3347,2020-10-09 04:21:55,j7ltgh,Maybe he’d prefer the country not be flushed down the shitter by a sociopathic con artist.
3348,2020-10-09 05:14:10,j7ltgh,"Dwayne had also been a registered Republican, and spoke at the 2000 RNC. 

But a regular conservative can be anti-Trump, all they have to be doing is paying attention to the disaster he's been, and avoid his cult."

3352,2020-10-09 14:04:11,j7ltgh,He’s the highest paid actor in the world. You think he’s less intelligent than the president who inherited his wealth?
3353,2020-10-13 15:56:25,j7ltgh,"God, you’re stupid."
3354,2020-10-09 08:11:17,j7ltgh,And yet they celebrate when Rob Schneider or James Woods joins their cause.
3355,2020-10-09 07:01:33,j7ltgh,"If Dwayne endorsed Trump it would be the polar opposite response. “Finally, a celebrity with common sense! You will gain lots of support from your choice to listen to the FACTS!”

\*loses 40% of followers*"

3362,2020-10-09 09:56:55,j7ltgh,They are cool with Charles in Charge and Clint Eastwood talking to a chair.
3363,2020-10-09 15:23:45,j7ltgh,"It’s amazing too, because he is a Republican and his conservative fans who are voting for Trump are probably just embarrassed that another Republican celebrity thinks the administration is a trash heap."
3364,2020-10-09 07:09:30,j7ltgh,Especially when they voted for/support a reality TV celebrity who had no political/government experience for president.
3365,2020-10-09 11:31:50,j7ltgh,"Ironic too, considering your president is president mainly because he was a ‘celebrity’...."
3366,2020-10-09 13:24:49,j7ltgh,Ha funny that isn’t it. Are there outright Trump supporters among prominent celebrities?
3367,2020-10-09 13:40:37,j7ltgh,Because people are hypocritical cunts and no one is above being full of shit.
3368,2020-10-09 13:42:03,j7ltgh,"Meanwhile, Trump is literally a reality TV celebrity."
3369,2020-10-09 14:35:13,j7ltgh,If only they took that stance in 2016.
3370,2020-10-09 14:43:15,j7ltgh,“They” = all of us.
3371,2020-10-09 15:00:14,j7ltgh,"Weird, the President was a celebrity before this."
3372,2020-10-09 15:01:18,j7ltgh,All hollywood elite are democratic mostly arent they
3373,2020-10-09 15:42:29,j7ltgh,"Same goes for the liberals and conservatives. Recently Actor Mark Duplass got so much hate on social media for saying that even though he disagrees with Ben Shapiro’s politics, Ben turned out to be a really good person when he actually talked to him."
3374,2020-10-09 17:05:21,j7ltgh,"This is what pisses me off about all of the conservative football fans that are “boycotting the nfl”.  The main thing I hear from them is that they hear the message yet they think football players should stick to football and find a different platform.  Do they have a problem with the national anthem being sung? No.  Do they have a problem with the military support the nfl shows? No.  Do they have a problem with breast cancer awareness month? Do they have a problem with any of the guys who’ve been put up for the Walter Payton award for their charity work that they use the NFL as a platform for? No and no, they don’t care about the platform at all.  They just don’t believe blacks lives matter."
3375,2020-10-09 17:25:10,j7ltgh,But I mean let’s be honest. Most celebs are liberals. They vote for/say anything that will make them likeable. Honestly a bunch of sellouts.
3376,2020-10-09 19:10:28,j7ltgh,I feel like this is one of those things that goes both ways. Let’s not pretend that if he came out and supported trump that folks wouldn’t be saying the same shit.
3377,2020-10-09 19:49:20,j7ltgh,"This argument goes both ways, doesn’t it?

I see plenty of people calling for celebrities to stay out of politics if they’re conservative."
3378,2020-10-10 11:57:02,j7ltgh,"But, you guys do the same thing? Every time a celebrity “comes out” as being literally anything other than hyper left wing, they’re canceled instantly."
3379,2020-10-09 12:20:56,j7ltgh,"Exactly, I’d much rather have a legit self made millionaire give me advice than the self-proclaimed “self made billionaire” who just leveraged his daddy’s already existing empire."

Do I tell my plumber take down his yard sign and to stick to plumbing? No, that’d be stupid. Apparently to these types once you hit a certain level of popularity you are no longer entitled to voice your support."
3382,2020-10-09 22:39:34,j7ltgh,"Don’t hate friend. You can pity them, they live in a deluded world where they’re “gaining” and getting taken care of by the big dog. When in reality since they’re not part of the 1%.... they’re actually getting ripped"
3383,2020-10-09 13:44:01,j7ltgh,"> I am not switching to Hanes underwear just because Michael Jordan endorsed it.

Many people do though.  1 celebrity endorsing Biden doesn't do much but when thousands of celebrities and non-celebrities endorse him, it makes a difference."
3384,2020-10-09 12:26:08,j7ltgh,Well there’s your first mistake. Wait til he gets his Hanes on you
3385,2020-10-09 14:09:46,j7ltgh,So then why do conservatives get all pissy about it lol just unfollow and move on and let your actions do the talking. But conservatives are attention seeking cry babies who have to shit on the whole game before taking their ball and going home.
3386,2020-10-09 08:48:53,j7ltgh,"This looooooooong 4 years has definitely opened my eyes and pushed me fat left but it wasn’t trump, it was all the other republicans that enabled him and his loudmouth shit supporters that did it."
3387,2020-10-09 08:41:01,j7ltgh,So fucking true. They are no longer the  party of fiscal conservative policy. That is all central Dems now. The Repubs needs to be wiped out so we can advance as a society. I will always advocate anything but those traitors.
3388,2020-10-09 11:17:07,j7ltgh,Brit here. Politicians in general lie their asses off. The occupation calls for it.
3389,2020-10-09 17:16:47,j7ltgh,"I dislike trump as much as every other person here, but this doesn’t exonerate the neo-liberal Democratic party. They’re just as much to blame for the decline in working class people’s quality of life diminishing. Hillary and Joe are two of the most middle of the road, do nothing candidates the Democratic Party has ever nominated. I’m left leaning, but watching the left regress into the sad state of neo liberalism that got us into this mess to begin with is just sad. I’ll be voting for Biden, but very begrudgingly.

Edit: I’m a lefty, left leaning is not descriptive enough. I consider myself a social democrat and I sympathize with communistic ideological beliefs."
3390,2020-10-09 17:35:53,j7ltgh,You might want to look at Biden’s policy over the years.  He is a republican. Just because trump is so bad does not make Biden good.   Again we are voting for the lesser of two evils.
3391,2020-10-09 17:42:33,j7ltgh,"Unpopular opinions, but both sides are just as bad in their own ways. Choosing not to trust an entire side because of one person just divides the country more. I feel your point though."
3392,2020-10-09 18:30:11,j7ltgh,Everyone in politics lie its not a fucking right or left issue..
3393,2020-10-09 10:45:25,j7ltgh,This shows how fucked you and anyone with your mindset (Republicans as well) are. You can be right leaning and not vote trump.  Not trusting someone because they have a different mindset than you says a lot more about the type of person you are than it does about them.
3394,2020-10-09 07:18:22,j7ltgh,"That’s politicians, not only a republican issue."
3395,2020-10-09 14:49:55,j7ltgh,You really are sweet summer child if you believe only republicans in office lie lol.

So wrong"
3399,2020-10-09 08:07:34,j7ltgh,"Honestly, at this point in time President Johnson isn’t such a far-fetched idea. President Trump is more far-fetched than President Johnson would be. We know for a fact, what The Rock wants, The Rock gets."

3405,2020-10-09 11:02:33,j7ltgh,Nice try.  There are no celebrities that support Trump.
3406,2020-10-09 08:34:45,j7ltgh,"Lmao, this is just ironic. Either way, you are right. Stand by THE truth. Not your truth."
3407,2020-10-09 14:19:10,j7ltgh,"I’m not a Trump supporter, but I often go on r/conservative to see what “the other side” is thinking. You’re absolutely right. Each side chooses to notice the worst members of the opposing side and then turns a blind eye to their own.

For what it’s worth, here’s a somewhat [similar comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/j77od4/are_americans_tired_of_being_called_racist_yet/g846xqm/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) saying that both sides are guilty of labeling/dismissing. You’ll notice that they weren’t downvoted as much as you were for having a nuanced take.

It wasn’t exactly a welcome opinion and it could just be that that sub is smaller and less susceptible to group-think, but maybe it should make people rethink downvoting you for pointing out hypocrisy."
3408,2020-10-09 11:10:43,j7ltgh,No it’s not.
3409,2020-10-09 15:03:11,j7ltgh,"A totally valid response, given everything that Trump stands for."

3418,2020-10-09 17:02:00,j7ltgh,He has considered himself a Republican in the recent past so he definitely has some right leanings. I would certainly not make him out to be some anti-Republican hero.
3419,2020-10-09 10:28:41,j7ltgh,Some fucking blog that points out he performed at a GOP convention 20 years ago when he worked for the WWE does not mean “he is a Republican” in 2020. SMH.

3423,2020-10-09 06:46:37,j7ltgh,Oh I know but like in the public eye endorsing Joe biden is a very woke/virtue signaling thing to do. Or at least that's how I see it
3424,2020-10-09 06:45:31,j7ltgh,Like cancel culture liberals
3425,2020-10-09 07:33:34,j7ltgh,Yeah I figure he's not one for complaining and probably stresses personal responsibility

3440,2020-10-09 06:49:56,j7ltgh,"It’s baffling that people think being pro life is the only thing that matters to a voter. A intelligent voter would see what all of someone’s policies are before making a choice on who to vote for. If the pro life voter was so pro life they wouldn’t support trump either. He just took a drug made from cells from abortions. He’s letting 10s of thousands of people die from Coronavirus. He’s literally infecting dozens of people in the White House. 
    Now the question is how can you support trump when he’s obviously not pro life when it comes to everything other than abortions?"
3441,2020-10-09 12:54:07,j7ltgh,Idk I guess I’m just different. I’ve never thought to myself “hmm I wonder what the rocks political beliefs are” or any celebrity. To each their own I guess
3442,2020-10-09 08:14:33,j7ltgh,Or freakin' Chachi.
3443,2020-10-09 10:21:57,j7ltgh,But don’t you know James Woods has a (self reported) IQ of 190!!! If he’s for Trump we’re not brain dead morons after all!!!!

3452,2020-10-09 10:46:06,j7ltgh,To be fair I haven’t seem one conservative that celebrated a celebrity endorsing Trump.
3453,2020-10-09 12:36:00,j7ltgh,"Definitely would have disappointed way more people on that one, his base is full of people that like him as a person and what he delivers, most of the ones that denounced him believed he was a “Hardcore Gun Loving Foreigner Hating Murican Patriot!” Because he lifts and wears the American flag...."
3454,2020-10-09 14:52:06,j7ltgh,Cognitive dissonance
3455,2020-10-09 18:04:24,j7ltgh,"How funny is it that Trumpers pride themselves on listening to “facts”, yet they routinely dismiss science and any form of factual evidence"
3456,2020-10-09 10:42:30,j7ltgh,And the opposite side would say the same that the trump supporters are saying today... both sides fall victim of this
3457,2020-10-09 09:51:24,j7ltgh,"And Arnold Schwarzenegger and Clint Eastwood, Sonny Bono, Fred Thompson. The only celebrity Democrat I can think of off the top of my head is Al Franken."
3458,2020-10-09 12:27:05,j7ltgh,"Nice, happy cake day! 

And yeah because Arnold still understands that being a republican or a Democrat is an ideology, not a college football team you idolize and follow regardless of them sucking. If the current “GOP” does not align with what you consider republican values the you should not  automatically vote red throughout all ballots and elections. 
The bipartisan system here has indoctrinated everyone to have an if you’re not with us 110% then you’re the enemy mentality"
3459,2020-10-09 15:58:08,j7ltgh,Arnold would be considered center-right these days. He believes in bipartisanship amongst parties to get things done. He believes in science and the environmental changes happening globally and that change needs to happen.

Its so weird that Trump was the face vs Vince’s heel. I was looking forward to Umaga beating Bobby Lashley at Wrestlemania just to have Vince rip off Trump’s dumb toupee. 

Then Trump took a heel turn when he started running for office. Bobby Lashley must be disappointed in Trump."
3463,2020-10-09 10:43:33,j7ltgh,They did win the election didn’t they?
3464,2020-10-09 12:22:50,j7ltgh,You know the ridiculous amounts of people I talked with back then whose reason for leaning towards Trump was “well maybe that’s what we need a business man and not a politician”
3465,2020-10-09 12:48:11,j7ltgh,And that’s after he’s been president for 4 years... Still no experience

3469,2020-10-09 11:06:10,j7ltgh,"Yeah, Trump is just the whitehead you see at the top of a mountain of puss.  None of them are willing to stand up for anything but their own power, and anyone that has a free thought of their own gets called a RINO"

They are something else completely that is equally if not more destructive than the Nazi party for sure though. So I don't think thats to far off the mark. We can all live in a free and productive society if we simply find a way to eradicate that party and refocus on education, science, separation of church and states and complete accountability of public servants (cops, judges, politicians, etc). 

The Republicans have shown us that they do not work for the American people and will weaponize the ignorant and easily manipulated to accomplish their paydays. 

I get it the Dems are not to far off the corruption mark either (taking money from lobbyist). Which is why we need to stress ranked voting to pull away from only having one or two parties dominate everything. However, the current system coupled with the prevalent ignorance leaves freedom vulnerable. The only choice right now is Democrats unfortunately. Which is why we have to vote them all in (progressive Dems when competitive) and vote all Republicans out. 

We have to push the Democrats to adopt reform, ranked voting, and separation of church and state. Not only that but to JAIL those politicians who broke the law to gain the lost confidence back in democracy. They cannot do that while an obvious saboteur serves as a opposing political party. If the Democrats REFUSE to do at least this when we rid the political spectrum of Republicans THEN we are fucked. Only option left will be revolutionary revolt. Which makes it easier to install a puppet dictatorship in the ensuing chaos.  

On the optimistic side. If the Dems can pull that off. It would open the door for more representation of important issues. Moreover, making third, forth and fifth parties actually viable instead of a wasted vote. This is what I'm hoping for. For freedom and democracy to come back from the brink of death stronger and better. But hell. We will see what happens."

But you are right that we are not talking about political opposites, it’s just that from my point of view a lot of Americans are treating affiliation to a political party like rooting for a sports team. In my country there is nothing wrong with agreeing with different parties policies, and disagreeing with others. You just have to choose the party that you agree the most with, and with parties they are gonna form government with. That’s why I’ve voted for 4 different parties in my local and national elections. But in the US it’s what? 10% undecided? And the rest is consequently voting for one party their whole lives, and choosing the other one would be to ‘abandon’ the side you are with."

3605,2020-10-10 01:27:37,j7ltgh,"If you are a trumpocrat, please spare us all the concerned left-winger troupe. It’s embarrassing.

To address your *far* right-wing talking points:

Whatever President Obama and VP Biden did saved our economy. Trump has been taking credit for the strong economy and low unemployment (pre-Covid) since before he even won last election. He didn’t do shit. If you could read a graph, you’d see that the economy has been steadily improving for the last 12 years. 

Under President Obama, immigrants at the border were detained for one or two days for processing. Kids were not separated from their families unless they thought they were in danger. And while waiting for their hearing, **they were given ankle bracelets, allowed to leave  and weren’t detained indefinitely.**

> Comparisons between Trump and Obama on immigration usually focus on deportations of unauthorized immigrants living in the US. Trump has been rapidly expanding enforcement, but the numbers are still comparable to Obama’s first term. (Obama holds the record for deporting more immigrants than any president, with more than 2 million deportations over eight years — though he scaled back enforcement in the last two years of his administration.)

>But the effects of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy for prosecuting illegal entry this spring — the separation of families as a matter of standard government practice for about six weeks, and now (thanks to Trump’s executive order) a coming court fight over the indefinite detention of families seeking asylum — are reminiscent, for those of us who’ve been following immigration for a while, of what the Obama administration did in 2014."

3608,2020-10-09 13:17:17,j7ltgh,Lol. To believe politicians aren’t in the business of lying or saying things to their benefit is pretty naive.

But you don’t see that.  Corporations own our government and our economy.  Real wages have not increased since 1940.  This country is not a democracy it’s an oligarchy.  See the Princeton paper that show in detail how this country’s policy is driven by the top 1%.   We would have tuition free college, healthcare and a myriad of other beneficial social programs.  But you would rather socialize the rich.  They privatize the gains and socialize the losses.   Think about that.    Banks got to keep the houses and cash in on all the bad loans.  Hm Obama and Biden bailed out the banks in such a way that is set back home ownership for all demographics except the top 8% of wage earners.  In addition corporate bailout in the form of huge tax breaks.  Also it was over 3 million deportations. This country was founded on very classist and racist values.  Systemic racism is a huge problem.  You are perpetuating the problem by supporting a centrist republican in Biden.  Say what you want.  Crime bill deportations tried to cut social security turned 3 wars into 7. Drone strikes DAPL fracking etc.  I do wish you well but this country really needs to reassess the direction we are taking because we don’t have much time.  Just tired of choosing between the lesser of two evils"

3649,2020-10-09 06:36:03,j7ltgh,"And I agree with that. That doesn’t mean there aren’t any democrats who lie. Trump’a campaign has been one of the most provably dishonest campaigns in free, first world countries that I am aware of. 

The simple fact that he’s a prolific liar shouldn’t make us change our standard for everyone else though. There needs to be a universal standard for honesty and everyone from all parties should be held to it. Including Trump. 

I think the amount of dishonesty seen from other politicians made it easier for Trump to get away with what he’s been doing. If every other politician was a pinnacle of honesty, I don’t think people would have allowed Trump to get away with it like we have. And that’s not excusing Trump.

I just think we need to stand united against dishonesty, not just pointing fingers and saying “they lie more”."

Would you say same things if he did same thing with ISIS' leader? Yes, Prince is bad as much as ISIS' leader. Rock was friendly because he is a businessman and all he cares is money and he was after Prince's investment. Claiming that he could hopefully do his part to help modernize the country is  just cringe. Even Rock himself wouldn't say a ridiculous excuse like that to defend himself.

3662,2020-10-09 16:04:57,j7ltgh,"Of course its different because its not in the mainstream for conservatives but it is on the left.

No it isn't, cancel culture is a second morality court independent of the law that was built to punish those the public deems guilty at the moment even if the courts dont or no crime has been committed.

Cancel culture actually is anti capitalist because it makes its decisions on the whims of some losers on Twitter instead of letting the free market decide. 

If you're talking about a lot of the #metoo movement yes I agree its about time, same with a lot of cop stories coming out right now, but about somebody saying a joke? Or doing something that was socially acceptable before but isn't anymore so we retroactively punish them? Its immoral."

I'll be downvoted anyway, but it's an honest to goodness question that might change my mind on it considering I'm getting buried."
3664,2020-10-09 06:33:55,j7ltgh,The article didnt say he lost more than he made. It says he lost more than any-other american tax payer. Which makes sense considering he has more than any american taxpayer. And again he made over $400 million in 2019. Assets totalling over $2 billion. Hardly a failure... how much did his parents give him?  2 billion? Ok...
3665,2020-10-09 06:23:42,j7ltgh,His assets exceed his debt   Your right  though. Hes not a millionaire. Hes a billionaire

Have you ever noticed how people seem to think that a person is a bad human being in general if they disagree with their politics?"
3667,2020-10-11 18:29:58,j7ltgh,">Biden is Trump

You’re the one who made the claim.

So out of the last 50 years, can you point to a president that you think did do everything 100% right? We are talking about the needs of the most diverse population in the world’s history by far. Which would mean that you have unrealistic expectations about what a president is. 

Especially since you don’t seem to understand the interplay between congress and the executive branch when it comes to change. Obama wanted to raise the federal minimum wage. Guess who blocked him? I don’t know if it stems from a major misconception about how government works, but just laying everything at Obama’s feet when the majority of the changes he was pushing for was obstructed by a hostile senate does no one any favors and just shifts the blame from the group that is actually responsible."

3672,2020-10-09 14:34:13,j7ltgh,Not all the people. The ones that vote republican.  They are shameful. The hypocrisy of voting for Donald Trump and then happily using blue state money to build their roads and pay their teachers is insane to me.
3673,2020-10-09 07:53:53,j7ltgh,"You must not have watched much of the democratic presidential campaign.

The Romney thing is an example of someone realizing their party is behaving so poorly that they have to personally tip the scale in order to sleep at night.  It takes having a party pulling rude stuff for that to happen.  The fact we’ve had a couple high profile instances of this for republicans is not necessarily damning of Democrats but potentially the other way around"

This actually made me lol. Cancel culture doesn’t make decisions. This is the free market in action and it’s beautiful! If someone says or does something that their consumers don’t like and they stop consuming that product, that’s the free market! People are free to do or say whatever they want. Some people will be upset by it and decide to not patronize their businesses."

Iraq war, Biden voted for the Iraq war. This is the biggest debacle in history and you’re OK you’re OK with it.  The Iraq war fucked our whole country up and you want one of the people who was part of the problem to be in charge just because Trump is so bad.   Don’t get me wrong Trump is bad but come on. saying that I do not understand the interplay between the branches of government is ridiculous.  You wanna vote in an individual who has done as much damage as Trump has done and you can’t even see it. And you’re using the excuse that Trump is so bad that anyone else is better just because Trump is so bad. Wake up.   

It seems that you can come up with excuse after excuse to blame the Republicans for what by Obama couldn’t do.   Do you remember Obama had the Senate and Congress when he was first elected he had a democratic super majority and he didn’t do anything about it so you can’t use that excuse.

Also go back and look at the Anita Hill testimony where Biden questions her. It’s an eye opener."
3689,2020-10-09 18:15:37,j7ltgh,Yea so both sides have their idiots it’s just people who lean heavy one way or another don’t think they’re side has that. When in reality they do

3692,2020-10-09 08:03:02,j7ltgh,"Really?  Democrats tip-toed around each other during the primary.  The only times someone threw a real punch was to accuse someone of being racist/ sexist.  The media *never* asked the front runners tough questions (until, funny enough, the front runner was Bernie, then the media went on the attack which shocked me).

Democrats will only attack each other if it’s in a Primary and even then they wouldn’t dare cross any lines.  With all the scandals around Ilhan Omar and the constant defenses given to her, I’m convinced the left   would never denounce the evils of people within their own party.  While it does happen outside of primaries on the right."

3699,2020-10-09 18:18:30,j7ltgh,"No it isn't because most of the people that complain weren't even consuming whatever product or entertainment they're complaining about. Its always people wanting to take things away from others that would enjoy it.

3710,2020-10-09 16:29:14,j7ltgh,"Good luck with that. 

You’re complaining about the ways society has always worked. In the past (and in some places still today) people accepted things like child labor, slavery, witch burning, child marriage, honor killings, gay conversion therapy, divine right of kings, colonialism, the list goes on and on. 

For civilized people, these things seem archaic and we’d never defend people who support them. But back in the day, they were accepted as normal. Then there was probably a period where some people knew they were outrageous, but those people were denounced as outsiders or trouble makers. As sentiments shift, the conservative supporters were the ones ostracized. That probably felt very confusing and unfair to them. They probably felt like they should be free to maintain the prejudices and biases they’d held their whole lives. 

At a certain point, they probably stopped discussing their views in public. Maybe only making jokes in private. 

There will always be people in that phase. Society is constantly shifting, and there will always be people holding on to the past. People who feel entitled to their prejudice. They let their prejudice define them."
3711,2020-10-09 21:46:54,j7ltgh,"Now you’re just making up situations in your head haha. But even if that were true, that’s STILL the free market in action! You can be mad about cancel culture if you want, and in some cases I’d even agree that it’s over the top (Louie CK comes to mind) but to say it’s anti capitalist is just wrong. It is private companies reacting to public opinion and market conditions. That’s the free market baby!"

And I guess my beliefs come from pretty much where most people’s beliefs come from.  My environment, personal experience, and so on.  I try hard to see all sides of an argument and often find it hard to agree with democrats so I’m a Republican.  I often disagree with republicans too, but I disagree with them far less often than I disagree with the other available parties."

Under Obama it was nearly impossible to do some construction and expansion jobs.  One of the biggest reasons the economy boomed so well under Trump is that he opened the economy back up and allowed investors to invest without fear of the rules changing every 2 weeks.

Normal people wouldn’t say something like that, it’s not something that needs said because it’s common sense, of course no reasonable person would support Trump if he didn’t denounce white supremacy.

You *saw* Trump refuse to condemn white supremacists in the debates, you saw him tell the Proud Boys to “stand by” and so you’re doing your best at damage control, pretending it’s a non-issue.

This is classic Trumpbot behavior. You need to be less obvious if you want to pull the “I don’t like his personality butttt here is why he’s the greatest” shtick. 

It’s humorous how you started on a rant about propaganda and you’re using a text book propaganda tactic."

Jesus was *literally* a liberal."
3752,2020-10-09 08:23:43,j7ltgh,So support the guy with the golden tower in the city of sin?
3753,2020-10-09 10:31:48,j7ltgh,"Holy smokes. 

You’re more than happy to have the government protect you from criminals by hiring police. 

You’re more than happy to have the government protect you from fires by hiring firemen. 

You’re more than happy to have government protect you from other countries by hiring an army. 

You’re more than happy to have government protect you from shit companies by hiring people to monitor food standard. 

Yet, the second anybody suggests the government protect you from death by hiring doctors and nurses, you lose your mind and act like it’s government overreach. The only people who benefit from private healthcare are the private healthcare companies and the drug companies, and the politicians they lobby. Yet you claim you don’t fall prey to propaganda. Hilarious."
3754,2020-10-09 07:38:44,j7ltgh,Is that really how that went or were those the narratives?
3755,2020-10-10 00:25:59,j7ltgh,"There’s no point in arguing with people who are blind to empathy. It’s the same with conspiracy theorists. Until you accept that you’re missing a fundamental part of being a relatable human, you’ll keep seeing those you disagree with as crazy."

3757,2020-10-10 01:32:07,j7ltgh,"No! The people tweeting have free speech too, everyone can and should use their voice and be vocal about their opinions (including you!) that’s what makes this country great. Free speech does not mean that your speech is free from consequences. You can say whatever you want but your employer is also free to fire your ass if they don’t like what you say. No one is being oppressed, that’s what makes it a great system."
3758,2020-10-09 08:42:36,j7ltgh,"Give me a break.  [Trump has condemned white supremacy constantly](https://m.youtube.com/watch?fbclid=IwAR0TejfUEh0yEDu_-Moak5bgmS3npMq457RtSiut6zn7dVinEo0swDpIzz8&feature=youtu.be&v=UbpFgqKClE4).  If he did it again it wouldn’t stop you from proclaiming this lie.  Why do you bury your head in the sand when he *does* condemn white supremacy?  Saying stand by to the proud boys (who are not white supremacists by the way) was a gaffe, but if you really think he was sending them cryptic messages on the debate stage then I have a bridge to sell you.  That’s a laughable idea."
3759,2020-10-09 08:31:58,j7ltgh,"Lmao

Really?  That’s the best you got?  Let me know when I can vote for a politician who hasn’t done egregious things and I’ll vote for them in a heartbeat.

I’m a big Romney supporter because I like his platform and he is a genuinely good person.  But Romney isn’t on the ticket.  Of the people on the ticket, Trump most closely aligns with the political positions I agree with so I’ll probably vote for him.  In 2016 I voted Evan McMullin, but he isn’t running this year.

Also, when you downvote everything I comment it causes me to only be able to comment once every 10 minutes.  So if you want to keep talking then please stop downvoting my comments just because you disagree with them."
3760,2020-10-09 07:53:01,j7ltgh,"Yeah that’s literally how it went, you’re speaking to someone who was very affected by this."
3761,2020-10-10 00:34:39,j7ltgh,"But where are you getting that I have no empathy? Whats your evidence? 

And I dont see you as crazy, again, I wish you'd read my comments properly. What I said was that your examples went way beyond what I was talking about. I was just complaining about cancel culture in general and you started talking about the holocaust and slavery as if theyre even close to being equivalent."
3762,2020-10-10 02:24:08,j7ltgh,But do you think its okay for people to be fired over innocuous offenses such as jokes? And if youre gonna be punished for your speech how exactly do you have any freedom? I get it that theyre not going to jail but losing your job and being blacklisted from your industry is horrific. I really hope it never happens to you.
3763,2020-10-09 08:35:33,j7ltgh,Just an observation. I’m a Christian. I don’t think he aligns with my views. I also believe in democracy which means separation of church and state. But hey you do you brother.
3764,2020-10-10 18:52:54,j7ltgh,Do you have sources?
3765,2020-10-10 00:37:39,j7ltgh,"When you call people insane, it shows you can’t see the world from their POV. That’s empathy. 

You may think the things I mentioned are outrageous examples now, but that’s only because you’re the product of a society that’s been liberalizing for the past few thousand years. There were times when all of those atrocities were considered fine, and the people who railed against them were “insane”."
3766,2020-10-10 03:53:34,j7ltgh,"Yes! Lol people get fired for dumber shit than jokes all the time. As a business owner I have the freedom to employee whoever I want and let them go at any time for any reason. Again, no one is being oppressed here"
3767,2020-10-09 08:54:16,j7ltgh,"I’m sorry, where is it written that democracy means separation of church and state?  That’s a funny idea, because democracy means the people vote.  Just because I have ideas that stem from religion doesn’t mean I should attempt to not vote that way to “keep them separate”.  In fact, western values stem from Judea-Christian values.  Whether people realize it or not, religion has influenced their way of thinking and their moral compass.

Just so you know, that phrase “separation of church and state” originates from a letter written by Thomas Jefferson who was saying the state should not interfere with religious matters, pretty much reinforcing freedom of religion.  It does not appear in any federal legal document like people seem to assume.  Funny enough, Jefferson was in favor of state sponsored religion, meaning tax dollars from a local state government going towards a church.  That reinforces the fact that he was not talking about religion influencing politics, rather politics influencing religion."
3768,2020-10-10 00:54:31,j7ltgh,"For the love of God, I never called you insane. I dont think youre insane.

Wow dude yeah I'm sure we're gonna look at allowing offensive jokes just as badly as we look at slavery."
3769,2020-10-10 04:59:50,j7ltgh,I'm not claiming oppression I'm claiming immorality and stupidity.
3770,2020-10-09 09:01:28,j7ltgh,"You make a great point. Let people vote and show what the country stands for. I sincerely hope it’s not for calling for violence, or attacking opponents, or sheer lack of civility and empathy. Which is all I see from trump."
3771,2020-10-10 05:03:27,j7ltgh,Well immorality and stupidity is just American tradition
3772,2020-10-09 09:04:32,j7ltgh,"Trump has been attacked since before he was inaugurated, so I can’t really blame him for going on the offensive.  I’ve seen trump be civil and empathetic, although not as often as I would like.  I would like to see the calls to violence though because I haven’t seen that at all."
3773,2020-10-10 05:04:46,j7ltgh,Lol I definetely was expecting a so called progressive cultural change to look much different
3774,2020-10-09 09:06:54,j7ltgh,In his early rally’s he would talk about what they would do to dissidents in the “old days”. That’s just from the top of my head but there’s definitely a list somewhere. I’m not gonna go looking. Not like I’m gonna convince you.

Dwayne Johnson arrives informing him that he’s not the friendly mailman who delivers his Netflix DVDs but an undercover CIA operative who works who’s Reynolds wife, Gal Gadot. One of their most famous agents (Cruise) along with Gadot, who was supposed to be on a Wine trip with girlfriends, has gone missing deep behind Russian lines.

3861,2020-10-08 19:11:33,j7dazw,"Well, that stacked cast certainly answers the question of the impending monthly price hike."
3862,2020-10-08 19:14:53,j7dazw,"So that article is from June, it's about a possible negotiation for Cruise to join the cast - have they negotiated or is it the same news as it was in June?"
3863,2020-10-08 20:06:33,j7dazw,Not interested in Tom Cruise as leading man. Prefer his work in supporting roles. Collateral & Tropic Thunder.
3864,2020-10-08 20:34:10,j7dazw,Tom Cruise trying to out action The Rock is gonna be a sight to behold.
3865,2020-10-08 21:53:41,j7dazw,That’s going to be an expensive ass movie...
3866,2020-10-09 00:35:21,j7dazw,Of course Tom Cruise is running in the poster image.
3867,2020-10-09 01:36:49,j7dazw,"Oh what the fuck.......

Netflix, shut up and take my money. I hope Cruise can play a villain."
3868,2020-10-09 05:55:39,j7dazw,"Hollywood getting back to work with big budget flop, nice."
3869,2020-10-09 11:46:36,j7dazw,This explains why my monthly fee just went up. Can they just make better movies? Not more expensive ones.
3870,2020-10-09 21:10:03,j7dazw,"This article is from June 23. If Tom was signed, we would have known by now."
3871,2020-10-08 16:48:49,j7dazw,"What's with the sudden influx of random rumors popping up on this subreddit? Illuminerdri is a random film blog that has no insider info. Plus, Cruise is busy with filming the next two Mission Impossible films back to back which is gonna take longer than however long it'll take for this film to finish filming and he's likely gonna be training for his space trip (which is happening next year) after that."
3872,2020-10-08 15:28:00,j7dazw,Go away tom
3873,2020-10-08 17:42:42,j7dazw,"Netflix will do what the studios refuse to, adapt to the new reality. It’s like Covid is killing off not only old people but the old way of doing things."
3874,2020-10-08 18:22:01,j7dazw,"I'm getting super tired of Netflix throwing insane money at A listers for these attempts at blockbusters which have all been mediocre or worse, meanwhile they cancel great series left and right before their time.

They can pay each of these assholes 20 million but they gotta can Bojack, Glow, and Santa Clara Diet?  Fucking bullshit."
3875,2020-10-08 19:09:31,j7dazw,Why ruin it with Tom Cruise?
3876,2020-10-08 15:10:07,j7dazw,How have I never heard of this before?
3877,2020-10-08 15:19:11,j7dazw,Is Tommy the one running on the movie poster?
3878,2020-10-08 15:23:19,j7dazw,This is going to be an awesome movie
3879,2020-10-08 15:46:22,j7dazw,Universal is probably blowing up netflix's phone right now asking if they can please become a producer on the movie again.
3880,2020-10-08 15:53:05,j7dazw,That's pretty big time
3881,2020-10-08 16:04:23,j7dazw,Since they're spending so much on stars. I wonder if that means they'll cut back on other things for this film.
3882,2020-10-08 16:42:36,j7dazw,"How the hell did Netflix afford a cast like that?

Also, is Tom Cruise really just a running silhouette? That's hilarious."
3883,2020-10-08 17:19:36,j7dazw,I see Ryan! I wonder if this takes place in the same universe as the Hitman's Bodyguard.
3884,2020-10-08 17:48:11,j7dazw,Of course Tom Cruise is running on the promo cover.
3885,2020-10-08 18:10:03,j7dazw,I think I would watch most any movie that could get this list of actors on board.
3886,2020-10-08 18:20:43,j7dazw,Cruise and The Rock are two guys I would not have expected to do streaming.
3887,2020-10-08 18:34:16,j7dazw,What a cast!  I really hope this isn't a terrible movie that relies on the All-Star cast to bring views. You wouldn't think that would benefit Netflix as much as it did traditional movie studios that released in theaters.
3888,2020-10-08 18:35:50,j7dazw,Tom cruise is great!
3889,2020-10-08 18:42:24,j7dazw,Seems like the logo is almost the rip off from the 2010 movie RED(Bruce Willis)
3890,2020-10-08 18:47:23,j7dazw,Won't be any scientology riff raff hanging around that set.
3891,2020-10-08 19:07:09,j7dazw,"Is it just me or is it weird seeing Tom Cruise share the spotlight with this many A-Listers? Like, aside from supporting role movies like Tropic Thunder or some of hid older roles, a Tom Cruise movie is usually him front and center. He'll actually have competition here."
3892,2020-10-08 19:20:28,j7dazw,Sounds amazing.
3893,2020-10-08 19:55:51,j7dazw,Is this based on the book at all or just barely enough that they can use the title
3894,2020-10-08 19:56:11,j7dazw,I wonder who is running in that silhouette 🤔
3895,2020-10-08 19:59:51,j7dazw,"I see this being a typical Netflix movie where money is spent on the actors, with a lower budget for the actual movie"
3896,2020-10-08 20:03:04,j7dazw,"If you told the 90s WWF (back when it was WWF) Rock that one day he'd be starring in movies with Tom Cruise, and *he'd* be the highest paid movie star in the world, and the lead in nearly every one of his movies.....the Rock would not have believed it either."
3897,2020-10-08 20:04:17,j7dazw,This will be great action content
3898,2020-10-08 20:05:39,j7dazw,I’ve seen Tom Cruise running so many times I instantly knew that was him lol
3899,2020-10-08 20:05:47,j7dazw,If the movie sucks it's because they blew their entire budget on the cast.
3900,2020-10-08 20:06:02,j7dazw,what's the talent budget? OMG
3901,2020-10-08 20:07:23,j7dazw,Will this be the most expensive Netflix movie ever made? Every actor on that list demands a HUGE salary.
3902,2020-10-08 20:12:24,j7dazw,So a billion dollars are just going to the actors in this movie.
3903,2020-10-08 20:12:27,j7dazw,looks like a copy of RED with Bruce Willis
3904,2020-10-08 20:15:30,j7dazw,That's a LOT of egomaniacs on 1 set.
3905,2020-10-08 20:25:04,j7dazw,"Oh its just a rumor, would be cool if it actually happens."
3906,2020-10-08 20:50:57,j7dazw,"So, there will be lots of running in this movie then?"
3907,2020-10-08 21:03:08,j7dazw,This is a weird way to get Cruise into the FF franchise.
3908,2020-10-08 21:06:47,j7dazw,This is going to be awesome. 100% cant wait
3909,2020-10-08 21:21:05,j7dazw,Drinking game for Tom cruise movies. Drink when he runs.
3910,2020-10-08 21:22:58,j7dazw,Netflix tossing out some chedder.
3911,2020-10-08 21:25:32,j7dazw,If there's one thing people were doing during the pandemic it was watching Netflix
3912,2020-10-08 21:26:57,j7dazw,Shame so many jumped ship after their groomer side came to light.
3913,2020-10-08 21:50:02,j7dazw,"This has been shooting for a while IIRC so I assume it's just gonna be a cameo/small role?

Still, will be so weird to see The Rock and Tom Cruise together."
3914,2020-10-08 22:08:29,j7dazw,At first glance i thought it was an Archer Movie. I guess thats ok too.
3915,2020-10-08 22:10:04,j7dazw,"So, no Kraft Services?"
3916,2020-10-08 22:14:08,j7dazw,Lol Jesus Christ how
3917,2020-10-08 22:21:47,j7dazw,Comedy musical caper
3918,2020-10-08 22:27:13,j7dazw,He better be reprising his role as Les Grossman.
3919,2020-10-08 23:32:05,j7dazw,Great cast!
3920,2020-10-08 23:36:56,j7dazw,"Oh wow another Rock movie, wonder if he’ll play the same character as always again"
3921,2020-10-08 23:46:20,j7dazw,Jesus Christ...is also joining the cast.
3922,2020-10-08 23:49:41,j7dazw,"I just read something about Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds being the 2 highest paid actors in Hollywood (although I could be wrong about that). Tom Cruise and Gal Gadot cannot be cheap, either. 

But all of them in a movie together sounds awesome. Expensive, but awesome."
3923,2020-10-08 23:51:13,j7dazw,"If D Wayne is in it, it'll most likely suck balls. His movies are horseshit."
3924,2020-10-09 00:02:17,j7dazw,"Tom Cruise as Les Grossman, the art enthusiast that hired Reynolds to hire Gadot to do the job.

The larger-role-in-the-sequel is a cover for the Les Grossman solo film, wherein Reynolds cameos as his fixer, Johnson the agent-of-the-law he eludes, and Gadot toying with his heart.  Mid- or post-credits scene involves McConaughey showing up to Les' office: Les has an idea for a movie and needs a certain actor for it..."
3925,2020-10-09 00:21:50,j7dazw,I really hope that’s Tom cruise silhouette running throughout the film
3926,2020-10-09 00:23:49,j7dazw,"That's a lot of cooks in the Kitchen. Apparently Cruise doesn't like anyone on screen running with him, I want them all running together. Cinematic Marvel"
3927,2020-10-09 00:26:37,j7dazw,You know Tom's gonna force in a scene where he's naked/topless and Gal Godot is gawking at him like he did with The Mummy reboot.
3928,2020-10-09 01:17:42,j7dazw,That’s a great cast!
3929,2020-10-09 01:17:59,j7dazw,I feel like I've been hearing about this movie's production since like 2017.
3930,2020-10-09 01:23:11,j7dazw,Who's the director for this and what's the budget like... Good heavens?? The Rock and Told Cruise alone have to have like at least 75% of the entire budget for this film.
3931,2020-10-09 01:37:33,j7dazw,"Wow, epic crap."
3932,2020-10-09 01:38:22,j7dazw,Well this will be the most expensive movie of all time.
3933,2020-10-09 02:22:17,j7dazw,I see that Tom Cruise running is an iconic silhouette like Air Jordan. I actually approve of this
3934,2020-10-09 02:22:42,j7dazw,Feels like they just picked names out of a hat
3935,2020-10-09 03:31:49,j7dazw,Netflix cancels show after show... so they can pay every A-List actor in the game to star in their shitty movies?
3936,2020-10-09 04:09:12,j7dazw,3/4 are from Fast & Furious movies lol
3937,2020-10-09 05:32:22,j7dazw,Wow...just recently I was thinking how cool it would be to see Tom Cruise and The Rock doing a movie together...and now it's happening. So cool.
3938,2020-10-09 05:35:26,j7dazw,I'm super depressed because I'm moving back to America. But this made me happy.
3939,2020-10-09 05:53:26,j7dazw,Now you have my attention
3940,2020-10-09 06:23:54,j7dazw,"I like the Rock, but I can’t see him pulling his weight in a Tom Cruise movie."
3941,2020-10-09 07:00:17,j7dazw,"Well, I won’t be watching that then."
3942,2020-10-09 07:01:29,j7dazw,I assume TC is the guy running in the ad...
3943,2020-10-09 07:31:30,j7dazw,Hate him. Cult leader. Won’t watch anything cruise is in ever again.
3944,2020-10-09 07:35:15,j7dazw,"Please god, give me tropic Thunder Tom cruise. G5 playyyyaaaa."
3945,2020-10-09 12:00:09,j7dazw,Sounds expensive
3946,2020-10-09 12:43:48,j7dazw,I hate movie news nowadays. It’s all about scoops. It would have been great to be surprised by a Tom Cruise cameo in the movie. Now we can’t.
3947,2020-10-09 12:51:04,j7dazw,"Good. If big studios want to bitch out and delay things indefinitely, at least Netflix will produce good shit in the meantime."
3948,2020-10-09 12:52:32,j7dazw,"Well then it’s no longer a surprise, is it"
3949,2020-10-09 13:12:12,j7dazw,Ahhhh this explains the price increase for this month....
3950,2020-10-09 13:21:25,j7dazw,I don't really care about the guy's private life.  He's a great action star.  Color me interested in whatever this is.
3951,2020-10-09 13:58:21,j7dazw,"If Tom Cruise is going to have a cameo, he better be running the whole time, dammit!"
3952,2020-10-09 14:00:25,j7dazw,Hype lost as soon as I read Gal Gadot
3953,2020-10-09 14:00:58,j7dazw,I wonder how ? I dont think hes going to be the lead
3954,2020-10-09 14:23:50,j7dazw,Gal Godot is a terrible actress.. smoking hot yes.. but my god she is just terrible.
3955,2020-10-09 15:20:50,j7dazw,Netflix again with the attempt to make something not shit by throwing a fuck ton of money around.
3956,2020-10-09 18:08:44,j7dazw,"Bold predictions:

Tom Cruise will play a character who is Tom Cruise.

Dwayne Johnson will play a character who is Dwayne Johnson.

Ryan Reynolds will play a character who is Ryan Reynolds.

Gal Gadot will play a character who is Wonder Woman (who is probably just like Gal Gadot)"
3957,2020-10-09 21:57:12,j7dazw,"An old story from June....

If you ever need a demonstration of how r/movies never reads the articles, this is it."
3958,2020-10-08 17:05:07,j7dazw,I wonder if they know Gal Gadot supports Israel in the destruction of Palestinian territory and support of  Zionism.
3959,2020-10-08 17:09:18,j7dazw,STOP PUTTING TOM CRUISE IN MOVIES
3960,2020-10-08 16:41:11,j7dazw,Tom Cruise's height will be much more visible on this one.
3961,2020-10-08 16:42:48,j7dazw,"Seems unnecessary, they could get anybody else."
3962,2020-10-08 17:36:20,j7dazw,It's really going to hurt Tom's ego looking so tiny next to the Rock.
3963,2020-10-08 18:31:00,j7dazw,Netflix trying real hard to get out of their shitty movie history. Though that Chris Helmsworth one wasn't bad.
3964,2020-10-08 18:40:15,j7dazw,Genuinely disappointed that TC was added to the otherwise interesting roster. Dude spends way too much time micromanaging the production and changing scripts to suit him.
3965,2020-10-08 19:16:25,j7dazw,Can't wait to see the Rock Rock-Bottom Cruise through a cruise ship
3966,2020-10-08 19:27:06,j7dazw,Do people actually like Tom cruise?
3967,2020-10-08 19:42:00,j7dazw,Can’t wait to hear about cruise pitching Scientology to the rock...
3968,2020-10-08 20:22:52,j7dazw,"Black Adam, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, and a guy that thinks he has real super-powers."
3969,2020-10-08 21:29:55,j7dazw,Can Gadot act without using her accent?
3970,2020-10-09 13:59:23,j7dazw,Can’t we cancel cruise for being a Scientologist already??
3971,2020-10-08 14:46:47,j7dazw,Goddammit keep this fucking cult weirdo out of films. There are plenty of good actors who aren't the frontman for dangerous cults. Use one of them.
3972,2020-10-08 19:10:11,j7dazw,"Fuck Tom Cruise, that piece of shit cultist.

E: How fucked up in the head do you have to be to dislike my comment about hating cultists?"
3973,2020-10-08 16:59:00,j7dazw,"Could he please not?  
Could he please just bugger off to his cult church and wait to get arrested when some authority finally takes the stance against it they should have 20 years ago."
3974,2020-10-08 22:14:01,j7dazw,Tom Cruise is a gigantic irredeemable piece of shit and I wish people would stop putting him in such big budget movies
3975,2020-10-09 02:06:14,j7dazw,Fuck Tom Cruise. Guy is an abusive lunatic. I don't know why people agree to working with such a scumbag.
3976,2020-10-09 02:00:40,j7dazw,"Gal is such a dumb name

It is for this reason I have no interest in anything she does"
3977,2020-10-09 02:31:45,j7dazw,I was interested until Tom Cruise joined the cast.
3978,2020-10-08 19:25:11,j7dazw,Gal Gadot quickly became one of my favourite actresses after Wonder Woman. She just seemed so cool and collected/in charge.
3979,2020-10-08 19:50:28,j7dazw,"Scientology approves of this movie, it must be pretty whiz-bang.  Its always exciting when Miscavige gives old Tom the green light."
3980,2020-10-08 20:05:28,j7dazw,I’ll watch pretty much anything with Dwayne Johnson. Guy just doesn’t choose a bad script.
3981,2020-10-08 20:07:07,j7dazw,Incoming rewrites so he gets 90% of screen time.
3982,2020-10-08 14:46:30,j7dazw,"Red Notice has a budget of $150 million. That is easy comparable to bug budget theater releases. Netflix's business model allows for them to spend $150 million on a film, bypass theaters, and still make money. Disney, Warner, and others should take notice. They keep pushing theater release dates back but clearly there is a way to release these films."
3983,2020-10-08 20:08:18,j7dazw,"""oh... great"" 

-Dwayne, Gal, and Ryan, probably."
3984,2020-10-08 22:37:57,j7dazw,when people say celebrities are out of touch assholes i try to defend depending on which celebrity but never these 4
3985,2020-10-09 01:05:52,j7dazw,Ugh.  He's like Streisand. He always plays himself.
3986,2020-10-09 02:34:28,j7dazw,Didn’t Tom Cruise die a couple of decades ago?
3987,2020-10-09 14:39:11,j7dazw,Something tells me Tom Cruise wants to bang Gadot.
3988,2020-10-08 22:49:35,j7dazw,"Ugh god I hate Tom Cruise. I wont watch anything hes in, I dont care how good it is."
3989,2020-10-08 19:42:10,j7dazw,Ryan Reynolds = forced mid 00s dude bro comedies/college students steal the answers to the test movies. Damn. Audiences need to stop supporting this guy.
3990,2020-10-08 14:05:15,j7dazw,"Legitimate project, yes. But I think this is also a bit of a hit piece by Netflix, with this line up and potential cameo by Tom Cruise it is like saying to the Oscars and movie industry itself, ""Refuse nominating this."""
3991,2020-10-08 14:57:39,j7dazw,[removed]
3992,2020-10-08 19:10:20,j7dazw,Fun fact: Gal Gadot is a full foot taller than Tom Cruise.
3993,2020-10-08 19:45:44,j7dazw,If it does... this could be incredible. It could also be a joke. Also isnt Tom Cruise like... in space or some shit?
3994,2020-10-09 00:48:36,j7dazw,Like tropic thunder?
3995,2020-10-09 10:43:29,j7dazw,"*if it happens*

It's refreshing to see someone being realistic.

I keep seeing big budget movies being pushed back to 2022.

I doubt studios are willing to invest in a new film, when the ones they currently have aren't even making money."
3996,2020-11-19 03:39:25,j7dazw,They will most likely film his cameo in LA If he is in it
3997,2020-10-08 14:00:13,j7dazw,"Yep. According to the report, it's just a cameo to set up a possible sequel, where Cruise would have a more major role in."
3998,2020-10-08 14:26:27,j7dazw,They're all getting paid $20m each.
3999,2020-10-08 15:27:28,j7dazw,I'm more impressed that Netflix is able to afford Tom Cruise now.
4000,2020-10-08 16:41:54,j7dazw,And they will make a mediocre film with all of them.
4001,2020-10-08 15:06:52,j7dazw,And none of them have been in big picture movies together as far as I’m aware and that’s something I really want to see.
4002,2020-10-09 01:15:01,j7dazw,It is but it's being written and directed by the guy who wrote and directed Skyscraper — a complete turd of a movie.
4003,2020-10-08 15:15:08,j7dazw,Maybe a mockumentary style film
4004,2020-10-08 17:16:54,j7dazw,Fun Fact : They wrote a script for a film about that character after his insane popularity from the film.  All the parties involved felt it should never see the light of day after reading it.
4005,2020-10-08 17:32:16,j7dazw,. . .Play-yah?

Let's see about Cruise though, because they're still in negotiations with him, and I suspect he will want some control over the set, so he may demand a producer credit.

Ryan Reynolds got $20M for each of his last 2 Netflix films, so fair to say he'll get at least that again. Gal Gadot also got $20M for her role in Red Notice (with Reynolds), so it's fair to say she'll see that again, too. 

Netflix has \~180M subscribers. Even at the lowest $10/m per subscriber, that means they're bringing in a couple billion a month. They've got money to throw around."

4057,2020-10-08 15:35:29,j7dazw,"Disney would lose money if they tried to release their currently tabled tentpole films onto a streaming platform (there's a reason why MULAN had a $30 premium attached to it).

Netflix is able to do this because of their subscriber base, which dwarfs Disney and Warner's by many orders of magnitude, and even achieving that required taking on insane amounts of debt (valuation over liquidity, baby!). If Disney wanted to compete at that level they'd have to pursue streaming at the expense of literally everything else, for years, to get to the point where their subscriber base was robust enough for it to make any kind of sense to spend that kind of money on content that would bypass traditional theatrical distribution, or they'd be operating at a huge loss. And the pursuit of this goal would mean effectively throttling their production pipeline of tentpoles in the process. Netflix wasn't always in the position to be able to spend this kind of money on original content, it took years and years, and they're still taking on debt to do it."
4058,2020-10-08 14:18:37,j7dazw,I don't really see that; none of these people are really Oscar players; Cruise is the only one who's been nominated and not for his action roles.

4060,2020-10-08 15:28:40,j7dazw,That doesn't make...any sense. Netflix movies got nominated for more oscars last year than any other studio. They're not pushing one of their likely mediocre action movies in the hopes that it gets nominated.
4061,2020-10-08 15:43:34,j7dazw,"...what? Despite the fact that this is nonsense and definitely not the kind of film Netflix would even bother positioning as an awards contender, where are you getting the idea that they would have this adversarial approach to the Academy and the awards process itself? If they feel they have an awards contender on their hands, they'll just release it in a qualifying theatrical run like they always have (see: ROMA or THE IRISHMAN, for instance). They purchased the Egyptian Theatre for pretty much exactly this purpose."

It’s hard to say if they made money off of it because they keep those metrics pretty close to the chest but it was still considered a hit to a certain extent."

Right now I'm only aware if him making Mission Impossible movies, which I'm sure he controls. He's pretty much credited with killing the Dark Universe Studio single handedly and I wonder that while studios think he may be box office, him trying to control a movies editorial and marketing is too risky/ cost them a lot.

What really surprised me is that he only does movies where he is the singular star, and that's been the case for decades. Being with other leading stars is either a tiny bit if humility, or more likely a new team and an attempt to stay relevant (or the church needs cash)."

4197,2020-10-08 18:03:35,j7dazw,"Of course it goes against Netflix's model, because they're two different models, and Disney trying to replicate Netflix would require such an enormous shift in their strategy for producing movies that it would basically reshape the entire company. Netflix doesn't really have any distribution infrastructure for theatrical release outside of small award qualifying runs for things like ROMA or THE IRISHMAN.

If Disney released a movie like MULAN or BLACK WIDOW onto their streaming platform with no premium charge, they'd lose money. Flat out. Those movies are produced at a scale and expense that would not yield a return on investment if they dumped them on Disney+, given that streaming platform's current subscriber numbers and the sheer numbers of projects currently produced by Disney at that scale. Disney's subscriber base pales in comparison to Netflix's, and it took Netflix a very, very long time to build up to that number by taking on debt and producing a huge variety of relatively inexpensive original content, which broadened their subscriber base over time.  Them financing big blockbuster level stuff is a relatively recent development, and it wouldn't have been feasible even five years ago. If Disney wanted to be able to release these huge movies regularly on Disney+ for the flat monthly fee, at the end of the day they'd need more subscribers, which they don't currently have. Devoting themselves to increasing subscriber numbers until they have a comparable base would require them devoting themselves almost exclusively to creating smaller-scale projects with a more diverse demographic appeal, at the expense of their regular slate of big-budget blockbusters. This is exactly what Netflix did, and they didn't have to worry about the ""brand identity"" of their content because they were targeting literally anything and anyone - prestige dramas and low budget horror and trashy reality TV alike, plus the licensing of content from other studios (how many subscribers did they gain by having FRIENDS and THE OFFICE?). Disney doesn't have that advantage because their service is still centered around family product and the ""Disney brand"", which limits their content options to a degree. They're two completely different business models and they aren't really comparable."

4230,2020-10-08 21:29:25,j7dazw,"It's logistically impossible for Netflix to be making money off things like The Irishman. The company is largely depending on growth in foreign markets to keep their stock price soaring. They are absolutely bleeding money, which is okay, because they can afford to right now. Once the streaming wars settle down and their room for growth ceases (it's already diminishing), they are going to have to be way more cautious about the types of spending they do, and how they promote and release films. When the playing field levels out and they don't have preposterous amounts of venture capital coming in, Netflix can't afford to eat a 100+ million dollar loss on something like The Irishman. To justify its cost the same way they could at the box-office, they would need an insane amount of users to watch it and only it for a whole month of their subscription. Their model isn't conducive to these mega-budgeted films, not unless they are going to start giving them a traditional box-office run prior to release on streaming."
4231,2020-10-08 21:34:37,j7dazw,"My understanding is their use of data is a little more nuanced than that. They don't use it to make creative choices, as much as they use it to determine an optimal budget for projects they want to do, against probable return metrics. Something like the Irishman would be more about PR value around awards and halo effect, over just how well it does in terms of views."
4232,2020-10-08 21:33:41,j7dazw,"I very much doubt they're using big data to determine the content they produce.

4277,2020-10-09 20:16:40,j7dazw,"Netflix is making an equivalent to each movie. The Irishman is to give future audiences something to watch when they inevitably search for The Godfather, so they don't have to license that."
4278,2020-10-09 02:23:01,j7dazw,I think that they're just trying to get as big as possible and then get bought out.

4281,2020-10-09 12:47:08,j7dazw,"As did I.  It is stupid, over the top, poorly plotted, and gratuitous.  But I didn't regret my time spent watching it.  Particularly since I didn't pay anything for it (like if my wife and I had seen it in theaters).  Besides, I enjoy watching Ryan Reynolds do Ryan Reynolds things."

4284,2020-10-08 16:27:26,j7dazw,I couldn't remember this movie so I had to google it. Saw Cameron Diaz and realized why I never watched it.
4285,2020-10-09 00:46:09,j7dazw,His interactions with the fireman ex bf were low key fucking hilarious
4286,2020-10-08 18:21:22,j7dazw,He definitely is. IMDb credited the voice of the bad guy to Champ Nightingale which is his fake persona for his Aviation Gin adverts.
4287,2020-10-09 07:02:33,j7dazw,"Was the terrible mustache part of your plan?

Of course! Warner Bros refused the Snyder Cut in favor of Whedon's! We had to find out what other footage you shot."
4288,2020-10-09 14:14:44,j7dazw,"I just had to look this guy up. I've seen almost every movie he was in, and still didn't recognize him at all...then again, I didn't see Star Wars, which I'm sure is the movie that would actually get him the fame."
4289,2020-10-08 18:28:06,j7dazw,"No. Ryan Reynolds *is* Deadpool. Those films wouldn't even come close to working with anyone else in the role, and he is absolutely the draw, especially by the 2nd film. Deadpool was barely a tertiary character until Reynolds made him famous. 

Plus, you have to remember that we're talking about a Netflix movie. Star power isn't needed to draw anyone in. You know what it takes to have someone watch a movie on Netflix? Put it in the Top 10 list, and it will get watched. That's literally it."
4290,2020-10-08 18:32:16,j7dazw,"You have no idea what you're talking about. Scale matters, diversity of content matters, distribution platforms and the way that is spread across produced content matters. It's not a 1:1 comparison. Netflix doesn't operate and isn't structured like a traditional film studio. Disney is.

How many movies the size of Red Notice is Netflix producing per year, compared to Disney? If Disney wanted to make their streaming platform an actual competitor to Netflix, they'd have to cut back on big tentpoles and diversify their content portfolio with broader, smaller stuff to actually compete with Netflix over time and bring in comparable subscriber numbers. That means cutting back on MCU movies, cutting back on Star Wars movies, cutting back on Walt Disney Co. live action films. All of it. If you look at the number of over-150-million budgeted films that Disney currently  produces compared to Netflix, it's not even close. Disney would need to redirect their resources in a *huge* way to get Netflix numbers if we're talking about subscribers, and that subscriber base is the very thing that allows Netflix to produce big projects right now without premiums (and even then, *they're still taking on debt to make it happen*).

In terms of movies, Disney primarily makes huge, four-quadrant, expensive blockbusters. Trying to compete directly with Netflix means making *less* of the thing that they are primarily known for. To what end? Outside of a pandemic they are more profitable than Netflix when they focus on theatrical rollouts."
4291,2020-10-08 18:37:53,j7dazw,"Plus he used to be a wrestler after all, weed was pretty common amongst wrestlers back then. It still is to this day"
4292,2020-10-08 17:49:34,j7dazw,"Mad? Who's mad?

 Boy, did The Rocks PR team just jump on reddit? I think he'll survive me talking a small amount of shit about him. Talking shit and calling someone out for being a hypocrite isn't mad it's calling out hypocrisy...if it's true. I didn't know I had to do the research on the level of a book to talk a bit of shit about The Rock."
4293,2020-10-08 17:44:43,j7dazw,"Because it's so much fun, JAN! GET IT! 

I'm more saying that would be redonkulously hypocritical of him with how many gallons of roids he's done and the fact that he owns a booze company. That's all."
4294,2020-10-08 18:17:55,j7dazw,"On an unrelated note, one time at a WWF event during the Attitude Era, I was taking a piss at a urinal, and The Rock walks in and begins using the one right next to me. I look over. He looks over. He says ""Thanks for coming tonight,"" and I said ""Oh, I'm not coming. It's pee."" Then he gave me an odd look, shook twice, and walked out."
4295,2020-10-08 16:45:44,j7dazw,Lmfao I actually believed you until that last part.
4296,2020-10-08 18:37:58,j7dazw,You‘re missing the end!

4300,2020-10-08 16:46:01,j7dazw,"Probably. But some things have changed. When Marvel wanted Downey Jr. they had to prove that not only was he clean but would stay that way. Some sets are different. But if you think the sets of these mega budget movies are full of drunks and smack addicts, well a lot of those days are over. The bean counters are in charge of the big movies, like the one above. Still, Seth Rogan is making movies some how, so there is still a place to get high and make a movie."
4301,2020-10-08 16:58:13,j7dazw,You do know it’s not the 70s anymore and film sets can be dangerous places. People have literally died on film sets. There are unions that have contractual rules that have to be abided. Such as the presence of a on set medic. Movies have to have insurance. You think insurance companies are giving out coverage with the stipulation that you can’t be so drunk you can’t say your lines? You do understand that a film crew is also part of the film set and they don’t stand in front of camera and say lines. In fact they work with heavy and sometimes dangerous machinery and run wires into the electric of the location. I think you should stop talking about things you don’t know anything about it makes you look foolish.

4317,2020-10-08 17:32:05,j7dazw,"Tom cruise always plays Tom Cruise. At this point it’s not acting so much as just picking roles that fit the personality he’s created. Let’s be honest, the same is basically true of the Rock."
4318,2020-10-08 21:02:01,j7dazw,He just did the voice because they couldn't get anyone they wanted. It wasn't meant to be his character as well. Just like how he voiced Juggernaut but that doesn't mean Juggs is Wade as well.

4332,2020-10-08 18:58:59,j7dazw,I think the point is that Cruise's character didn't see it that way.
4333,2020-10-09 05:03:08,j7dazw,Not by movie logic. His character in MI is an assassin.
4334,2020-10-09 03:43:08,j7dazw,Have you seen the 90's classic Assassin's? There is clearly a goody and a baddy!

4342,2020-10-08 18:02:12,j7dazw,What I always liked about Edge of Tomorrow is that it's about the journey toward him becoming Tom Cruise.
4343,2020-10-08 19:40:42,j7dazw,"Alright you got me, I'll give it a watch. I do love me some Tom Cruise movies."
4344,2020-10-08 18:34:23,j7dazw,"Tom Cruise used to diversify his output *a lot*. From Risky Business in '83 all the way up to Collateral in 2004, he was incredibly diverse in his role choices, and typically pursued projects that were headed by acclaimed filmmakers. Somewhere around the early-mid 2000s, he started pivoting away from filmmaker driven films, and rebranded himself as an action hero-only, with films he retained an immense amount of control over the creative vision. After about 2008, that transition had completely taken over. Part of the reason Will Smith's career has stagnated so much is that Cruise gave him the same career advice around that time. Cruise's main difference is he has a good screenwriter that cleans up all his projects (Christopher McQuarrie), and he has mainly been riding the Mission: Impossible success for over a decade now. His last role that didn't fit that mold was in Tropic Thunder, and the main reason he did that was because he ruined his public image with all his crazy interviews during the period when Scientology was running his PR (he fired them and got a real publicist again after all that shit went down).

It'll be interesting to see how Cruise and Johnson interact here, since they both have giant egos and like to control productions nowadays. Wouldn't be surprised if one of them is a smaller role that will be largely divorced from the other's scenes."

4377,2020-10-07 22:23:31,j70joo,"I would jettison any players that won't help you next year for draft capital or younger players, even if you take a small talent downgrade:

Foles will be tradable as a starting QB.

Freeman, Gore - these guys can be jettisoned for literally anything you get in return.

Robby Anderson is a great sell high to a contending team.
​
Hilton, Marvin, Beasley, Cobb, Jeffrey - these guys can be moved to a contender looking for immediate Flex production for a nonproductive lotto ticket e.g Bisi Johnson, Zacchesus, Bryce Love, Qadree Ollison"
4378,2020-10-07 22:21:22,j70joo,"It all depends on your league. Ideally, I prefer to ""trade down"" to younger guys that extend my window, but also keep me immediately competitive. For example, if I were able to turn Aaron Jones into say Miles Sanders+, I'd do that."
4379,2020-10-07 22:24:23,j70joo,I’d sell any veteran over 26/27 that you can get value for. Keep Jones but I’d sell Woods. You’re not going to win within the next 2 years so his value now mean nothing to you. Sell to contenders who will value him higher. Trade for young players with upside (who aren’t doing much this year) or picks
4380,2020-10-07 22:34:24,j70joo,Trade CD Lamb for Jalen hurts
4381,2020-10-07 23:55:55,j70joo,I agree with this. Anderson is a sell High right now. and essentially any future value you can get for the other guys on your squad is worth more than they are for you right now

4383,2020-10-07 23:49:29,j70joo,"Good call, I probably should look to move woods. Any recommendations for young players that aren't currently performing? It feels like any first or second year player that has shown flashes is likely overvalued by the owner, and any young player that hasn't is a big gamble."

4385,2020-10-07 23:54:04,j70joo,Kirk is a good example. Just waiting for Fitz to retire. Or Higgins with AJ green. You’re always going to get owners that overvalue and it’s going to be frustrating.  That’s why I say stick to contenders because their team benefits from woods a lot more than Kirk this year or maybe even next year. It’s gonna take some back and forth trade talk with a few different owners

4432,2020-10-06 13:25:19,j64vx1,Just traded Mostert for him and Kupp.... not sure why the other manager proposed that but i have never hit accept so fast
4433,2020-10-06 13:31:34,j64vx1,"Don’t let people here give you too much grief for last week. These posts are quality and much more than most of other users on here contribute. Hindsight is 20/20, can’t be right all the time"
4434,2020-10-06 13:24:13,j64vx1,Locked and loaded RB2 all the way with RB1 games sprinkled in the mix. Very nice write up btw. Concise and hits everything you need to know.
4435,2020-10-06 13:30:12,j64vx1,Really really needed this with the Chubb injury. Probably my flex play the rest of the year!
4436,2020-10-06 13:32:17,j64vx1,Someone panic dropped him bc they were in a bind this weekend and now I'm trying to decided whether or not to spend all my FAB I have left on him ($43 out of 100)
4437,2020-10-06 13:30:55,j64vx1,"I’m seriously thinking of starting him over Jacobs, which I know is ridiculous, but says more about Jacobs usage in a game they are gonna get steam rolled"
4438,2020-10-06 14:09:46,j64vx1,My league drafted a few days before Washington cut Adrian Peterson. I got Gibson for nothing. Very happy I've held onto him this long now that Ekeler is out.
4439,2020-10-06 13:25:08,j64vx1,cmon man why you gotta post this when I’m tryna sneak a trade right now 😂
4440,2020-10-06 13:27:30,j64vx1,"Loved the usage. Haskins seems to be getting better, but I also feel like a QB change could help with more quick checkdowns.  Hopefully seeing how explosive he was with the ball on his screen will make them more comfortable getting him the ball in space early. Excited for whats to come."
4441,2020-10-06 14:37:48,j64vx1,"Don't forget about your Henderson post either....

Jk this shit is hard af, especially the Rams lol. These posts are awesome even if they don't pan out"
4442,2020-10-06 13:46:38,j64vx1,Somebody drunkenly dropped him last week for a defense and I can’t thank them enough as Chubb hits the IR.
4443,2020-10-06 13:57:03,j64vx1,Gibson and Robinson are about to be in my lineup on a weekly basis  I think.  Any other -sons I should look for?  After years of jumping on hype trains on this sub that crashed and burned it's nice to have two pay off.
4444,2020-10-06 14:45:09,j64vx1,"With how shit Washington are, I think we’ll be seeing a lot of 13 for 46 yard games from him"
4445,2020-10-06 14:07:24,j64vx1,"> This should be the easiest matchup for him 

People wanted to bench him against Baltimore because it was thought to be his hardest matchup yet. Watch him dud this week against an easier team. 

Still starting him tho"
4446,2020-10-06 13:37:03,j64vx1,"I am so ready to get off the wild ride that is Michael Gallup after playing him over both Hunt AND Gibson this week in my flex.

This week with Aaron Jones on a bye, I'll be firing up Hunt in the RB2 spot and Gibson in the flex."
4447,2020-10-06 13:50:33,j64vx1,I have seriously considered abandoning the hope of a Drake bounce back and trading him for Gibson.  (FYI Gibson owner loves Drake in my league)
4448,2020-10-06 14:23:05,j64vx1,"He is an automatic RB2 or flex at the minimum at this point.

Baltimore is no joke and he got me 20 points. Will take that all day everyday"
4449,2020-10-06 13:36:23,j64vx1,"Losing Conner for the wk last wk made me realize I needed a RB since I have no depth in a 14 team league. Traded Ertz for Hockenson and Gibson before the wk 4 games and wasn’t expecting much from Gibson. Came away pleasantly surprised and enjoyed his breakout performance. This analysis only reinforces my hype

Side note: I shall now refer to him as Gangsta Gibs"
4450,2020-10-06 14:32:48,j64vx1,"Why did he get drafted by Washington.

He would be a super star on any other team"

😎"
4452,2020-10-06 13:50:49,j64vx1,I had no choice but to start him so it worked out for me!
4453,2020-10-06 13:51:07,j64vx1,"I wasn't able to get him in the draft, but boy, those who criticized using a 5th round pick on Gibson and took Week 1 victory laps must be feeling silly."
4454,2020-10-06 14:01:54,j64vx1,Great write up my only issue is about the ravens rush defense. Chubb averaged went 10 for 60 (6ypc) and Hunt went 13 for 72 (5.5ypc). Neither scored but I wouldn’t say we held them in check either. I think the ravens rush defense is very beatable with their rookie linebackers and would argue the ravens were the easiest matchup so far even over the rams.
4455,2020-10-06 15:00:34,j64vx1,Flex Gibson or McKinnon this week?
4456,2020-10-06 15:02:45,j64vx1,I love your analysis. I'm having a tough time picking between starting Gibson or Taylor this week. Taylor's workload has not been encouraging the last couple weeks. Thoughts?
4457,2020-10-06 15:07:37,j64vx1,I'm about to bench Kenyan Drake for Gibson this week.
4458,2020-10-06 15:15:51,j64vx1,Would you sit Jonathan Taylor for Gibson? JT has Cleveland.
4459,2020-10-06 16:00:33,j64vx1,Tempted to trade Jonathan Taylor for him. Only see his usage increasing as the season goes on.
4460,2020-10-06 17:24:01,j64vx1,I know this isn’t a trade thread but would you trade Gordon and obj for Gibson and scary Terry? In ppr

4462,2020-10-06 19:14:09,j64vx1,"Going against a stacked team so I need max points..

Thinking of Gibson in flex over Jonanthan Taylor. Agree?"
4463,2020-10-06 21:39:45,j64vx1,"Massive trade but taking a shot with Robinson.

I traded Kyler Kamara Deebo JROb and Hunter Henry for
Josh Allen zeke kittle and Gibson. 

I’ll miss jrob dearly but I’m on the Gibson train now with a little bit of kittle."
4464,2020-10-06 13:28:43,j64vx1,What do you guys think is his trade value now?
4465,2020-10-06 13:31:39,j64vx1,Gibson or Sanders this week? Eagles face the Steelers
4466,2020-10-06 14:02:49,j64vx1,I traded fournette for him before the season started. I was kind of regretting it but after this past week not so much.
4467,2020-10-06 14:28:31,j64vx1,Trying to decide if I should unleash him over DJ Moore.
4468,2020-10-06 14:28:45,j64vx1,I think I’m giving him the start over Monty this week. I’m so tired of the Chi backfield
4469,2020-10-06 14:31:04,j64vx1,"The most interesting part of all of this is most definitely his receiving usage. That is obviously his greatest strength, so seeing him finally used in the passing game is very exciting. 

Question - do you happen to have data on the number of routes he ran this week vs. the other backs (as well as weeks 1-3 to see if there has been any improving trends)? Having snap percentages in this post would also be nice (as well as trends)."
4470,2020-10-06 14:44:44,j64vx1,Just traded Conner and bench players for Kyler and Terry Mclaurin. Only was able to make the trade because I have confidence in Gibson as my RB2. Looking forward to seeing the kid ball
4471,2020-10-06 15:07:50,j64vx1,Him and Kelley are on the wire (8 team). Who do I prioritize?
4472,2020-10-06 15:08:48,j64vx1,Traded him for Sanders last week...thought I fleeced him and got a steal. What do you all think?
4473,2020-10-06 15:15:20,j64vx1,Would you guys ship out Chark or McLaurin for him?
4474,2020-10-06 15:22:00,j64vx1,Considering looking to sell him or James Robinson. Also got Josh Jacobs and Todd Gurley
4475,2020-10-06 15:31:54,j64vx1,Y’all think starting Gibson over Gurley moving forward?

4477,2020-10-06 15:49:42,j64vx1,I just trade Gibson+Jefferson for Hunt (I'm owning Chubb). Did I overpay? Who won the trade?
4478,2020-10-06 16:00:03,j64vx1,Hes a free agent in my league. Should I drop darius slayton for him?
4479,2020-10-06 16:14:39,j64vx1,"I read your post at like 7am on Sunday and swapped Dobbins in for Gibson cause of it YOU MONSTER!!!

Just kidding. I really appreciate the free analytics. Your posts are quality content and I still would’ve lost by like 20 pts."
4480,2020-10-06 16:25:13,j64vx1,So happy I didn’t drop them off for the poor week one
4481,2020-10-06 16:29:07,j64vx1,just traded him + AJB for Chubb/DJ Moore/J.Jefferson.. hopefully Chubb gets back in 6 weeks and makes me not look stupid.
4482,2020-10-06 16:54:43,j64vx1,Gibson owner also has Ekeler and is asking for my Kelley + Hines for his Gibson. Thinking i should take this and run? Really like what i saw with his receiving this weekend.

4487,2020-10-06 18:33:14,j64vx1,I traded him and Crowder for Godwin and Z. Moss in a standard league. Long term I think I still made the right call.
4488,2020-10-06 18:34:07,j64vx1,Traded Bell for him last week. Really happy to have done it. Especially now with the Ekeler injury

My Diggs and Conner for his Gibson and Taylor.

4499,2020-10-07 00:31:55,j64vx1,I’m seriously considering trading Melvin Gordon for Gibson in a 14 team .5 PPR league... Gibson seems to have secured the workhorse role in Rivera’s offense and Phillip Lindays return makes me nervous for Gordon’s outlook. Am I crazy?
4500,2020-10-07 01:18:54,j64vx1,Oh boy this is the kind of read that makes me happy to have bought that preseason hype and drafted him.
4501,2020-10-07 01:24:44,j64vx1,"He’s on the waiver in my league, just lost Chubb so I’ve been steadily increasing my bid in fear of losing out"
4502,2020-10-07 05:42:54,j64vx1,"I seem to always play the wrong choice between Gibson, Kelley, Henderson week-to-week. I haven't once started Gibson and I hate my life"
4503,2020-10-07 11:51:04,j64vx1,Would you trade gurley for Gibson?
4504,2020-10-08 21:37:49,j64vx1,Just traded Boyd and Mckinnon for him. Felt it was a fair one for both sides. Hoping for the best! Lol
4505,2020-10-10 21:25:21,j64vx1,What do you all think about a trading Melvin Gordon for Gibson?
4506,2020-10-06 14:41:20,j64vx1,You guys starting him over Taylor or Hunt?
4507,2020-10-06 13:37:41,j64vx1,im riding mixon/jacobs and gibson to the promise land....or hopefully just a win.
4508,2020-10-06 14:04:04,j64vx1,"Traded him for mclaurin in PPr. My RBs are mccaffrey, Robinson, Carson, Connor and bell"
4509,2020-10-06 20:43:17,j64vx1,"Ok so this week I can only start three.  Who do I bench in PPR?

Jacobs

Conner

CEH

Gibson"
4510,2020-10-06 14:05:40,j64vx1,"I now have Gibson as my flex and picked up the latest hype train, Damien Harris, before the game last night."
4511,2020-10-06 15:35:30,j64vx1,Should I start him over Ekeler?
4512,2020-10-06 15:43:18,j64vx1,I've got tickets on both the Gibson and RB1nson trains in a 16 team league. Hoping they can lead me to my first championship.
4513,2020-10-06 18:08:06,j64vx1,"Gibson, Robinson, Kelly, and Jefferson. 

My whole freaking team is based on hype trains I read on this sub. I've never had a single one hit listening to this sub and now I suddenly have an embarrassment of riches. What did this sub do to get less stupid this year?"
4514,2020-10-07 00:36:36,j64vx1,"I drafted him in 5 leagues, picked him over Taylor and Swift in dynasty and I couldn’t be fuckin happier."
4515,2020-10-07 03:12:01,j64vx1,"I cashed in packaging him with Godwin and Golladay for Nuk and McLaurin after his weeks two and three performances. Still have a RB rotation of Zeke, Jones and Jacobs (Had 4th pick, 3rd pick took Kamara and Jacobs fell to me in Rd2 because NFL.com’s rankings were weird, and then traded Taylor to a Colts fan for Jones after Mack got injured)"
4516,2020-10-07 04:35:42,j64vx1,"I was shocked to find Gibson still left on my waivers, just put a claim to drop Gallup for him... I need RB depth badly after CMC went down"
4517,2020-10-06 16:23:46,j64vx1,"I took Gibson earlier than most in a home league where QBs were flying off the board way too early.   I was debating taking Gibson or Stafford since most QB1s were off the board.  On the way back, Stafford went a pick before me and I was beating myself up about it.  I ended up with Josh Allen... sometimes it is good to be lucky."
4518,2020-10-06 14:13:14,j64vx1,James robinson would like a word.
4519,2020-10-06 15:07:34,j64vx1,"Slow to start, but it's started moving and it's going to be very hard to stop"
4520,2020-10-06 14:03:33,j64vx1,"Is he a masochist? Because it sounds like he’s actively looking to get punished, good lord"
4521,2020-10-06 14:49:02,j64vx1,"Ya that's a questionable move. Mostert can't even stay fit and even when he does, Gibson and him won't be too off. Kupp has been easily a WR2. Was this trade before Gibson v. Baltimore?"
4522,2020-10-06 15:02:16,j64vx1,Gah I have been trying to deal Mostert all season.
4523,2020-10-06 15:18:45,j64vx1,veto
4524,2020-10-07 06:16:56,j64vx1,I really appreciate that. I was super bummed about not giving the right advice. If I had a crystal ball I’d be hooking all of you guys up no hesitation. But I have fun doing the write ups and after I had Ridley drop a big goose egg on me yesterday night it helped remind me that all you can really do is give it your best educated guess but crazy things can happen.
4525,2020-10-06 15:43:09,j64vx1,"Same boat, I hope he keeps me afloat until Chubb comes back👊"
4526,2020-10-06 21:12:31,j64vx1,"As an Ek owner, fuck last week, but let's go...Gibson szn finally here boys"

4529,2020-10-06 13:50:36,j64vx1,If you can even get him for that. I'd drop more him if I could.
4530,2020-10-06 13:51:13,j64vx1,max it out and pray
4531,2020-10-06 13:50:46,j64vx1,do it
4532,2020-10-06 15:44:54,j64vx1,DO IT
4533,2020-10-06 18:33:41,j64vx1,bet the farm. worth it if you get him.
4534,2020-10-07 01:21:27,j64vx1,I would. Really no quality RBs on waivers this year.
4535,2020-10-07 11:02:44,j64vx1,"Do it, there's no other starting RB on waivers besides backup hype trains."
4536,2020-10-06 13:38:53,j64vx1,Im starting Gibson over him and used Jacobs name to trade for tyreek hill. My wrs terrible
4537,2020-10-06 13:57:41,j64vx1,Richard about to get 10 catches out the backfield lol.
4538,2020-10-06 14:41:23,j64vx1,"We drafted just after, and I went for him like 4 rounds before his outdated ECR. Glad I did at this point."
4539,2020-10-06 15:25:26,j64vx1,I was trying to trade for Jacobs and then ESPN posted Jacobs is a top 8 running back and the guy got cold feet.... thanks field Yates
4540,2020-10-06 19:37:13,j64vx1,"I just accepted to trade him away. Packaged him and Robby Anderson for Stefon Diggs. I'm set at RB though with Kamara and Carson, and also sitting at 1-3 so I feel like I need to address something."
4541,2020-10-07 05:57:27,j64vx1,The Henderson post haunts me as well. I need to do a follow up when I get the chance but that situation is just kind of gross lol
4542,2020-10-06 15:18:18,j64vx1,[deleted]
4543,2020-10-06 17:12:32,j64vx1,How would you rate Gibson vs. Robinson? I have the former but am interested in trading for the latter.
4544,2020-10-06 15:58:10,j64vx1,"DErnest Johnson, Darrel Henderson"
4545,2020-10-07 06:02:03,j64vx1,"Such is fantasy football. I needed 30 combined points in PPR between Ridley/Hurst/Gage Monday night to win and I thought I had it in the bag. Thanks Calvin, still love him though."
4546,2020-10-07 04:39:22,j64vx1,"just placed a claim to drop Gallup and add Gibson off the waivers.. never trusted Gallup anyways, it’s really a hit or miss with him, I need more RB depth anyways."
4547,2020-10-07 06:13:55,j64vx1,"I’ve got Jones on bye as well and I’m looking for a replacement in a deep league. God speed brother, I hope hunt and Gibson have monster games for you."
4548,2020-10-06 16:25:05,j64vx1,get gibson plus value
4549,2020-10-07 06:12:28,j64vx1,If you’re really wanting to ditch Drake for Gibson + maybe some additional value now could be the best time. Drake underperformed in two good matchups against the Lions and Panthers. If he underperforms against the Jets that’s going to be a big yikes.
4550,2020-10-06 14:53:40,j64vx1,"not on the Lions, that's for sure."
4551,2020-10-06 15:07:02,j64vx1,"I took him in the 6th in my Dynasty league. Definitely had people question it, but in my league that's about where hyped up rookies go thanks to most of the big names being kept from the previous year."
4552,2020-10-06 19:00:22,j64vx1,"Don't listen to these fools, Gibson hype grew in like 3 days. If you drafted early you got him late, if you drafted the weekend before kickoff you took him that high. I took him 5th round in a 14man, at that point all there was left was singletary and Gibson. No regrets."
4553,2020-10-06 14:56:19,j64vx1,"Yeah, you could have got him later rounds like the rest of us and got someone else in the 6th."
4554,2020-10-06 20:16:00,j64vx1,Waiver wire add for me
4555,2020-10-06 14:51:51,j64vx1,"I took him in the 11th in a 10 team league, so yeah, you did overpay him in the draft."
4556,2020-10-07 06:09:59,j64vx1,"I agree, I think Chubb/Hunt certainly got theres against the Ravens in terms of real world value. But individually they didn’t have great fantasy games. Hunt did a little better with a few receptions but didn’t get much receiving yardage. You definitely could be right about them being a softer matchup than they appear at a glance though."
4557,2020-10-06 15:07:02,j64vx1,"McKinnon if Mostert is out, Gibson otherwise imo."
4558,2020-10-06 23:08:52,j64vx1,Gibson. I’m trying to trade Taylor for Gibson. Maybe Taylor gets better later on but so far he’s been okay. This past week usage just really made me mad tho lol
4559,2020-10-06 15:10:53,j64vx1,same
4560,2020-10-06 17:41:25,j64vx1,Wish I could.
4561,2020-10-07 05:46:06,j64vx1,I replied to another guy in a similar position. Drake has a great matchup against the Jets but he also had great matchups against the Panthers and Lions and didn’t really do much with it. Drake is generally trending down and Gibson is trending up. At this point I think I’d rather start Gibson and if Drake produces on my bench so be it. I still want to believe in Drake but if he can’t get it done against the Jets I’d start sweating.
4562,2020-10-07 11:49:50,j64vx1,Yes.
4563,2020-10-06 13:35:45,j64vx1,Low RB2 type value.
4564,2020-10-06 16:10:45,j64vx1,"I have Henry, Carson, Robinson, McKinnon, Gaskin, Harris, and Hill. I'm pretty weak in WR. I traded Gibson for K Allen to help out. Not super stoked but with Ekeler out and Herbert performing well, it made sense to me."
4565,2020-10-06 14:26:11,j64vx1,"Fuck miles Sanders at this point.

Until they get a competent WR on the field teams will just stack the box against Philly."
4566,2020-10-07 05:59:23,j64vx1,I’m so biased against the Bears backfield. I had somebody on the bears a few years back and they were such a headache I just try to avoid them now.
4567,2020-10-07 05:54:49,j64vx1,That’s pretty solid. I’d rather consolidate points into one consistent starter than bench players. I’m a big Scary Terry fan and I enjoyed playing Kyler last year.
4568,2020-10-06 16:27:54,j64vx1,Gibson
4569,2020-10-06 15:46:59,j64vx1,I was offered McLaurin and White for him and I turned it down
4570,2020-10-06 15:53:59,j64vx1,I'd keep Gibson and try to sell Gurley tbh...
4571,2020-10-06 16:18:01,j64vx1,totally matchup depend
4572,2020-10-06 19:12:22,j64vx1,[deleted]
4573,2020-10-06 16:17:27,j64vx1,Yeah....
4574,2020-10-06 16:16:38,j64vx1,What do you think?
4575,2020-10-07 05:38:19,j64vx1,Lol I’m sorry man. I legit was bummed most of Sunday for putting out that advice and screwing over some people. I’m glad you enjoy the analytics though. It’s a lot of fun for me and should be the main takeaway for readers to make some decisions. I’m high on Gibson after last week so my projection is high. But I believe he’ll do well even if he doesn’t hit 20+ points.
4576,2020-10-06 16:52:23,j64vx1,I was actually thinking of doing a very similar trade but Chubb + Kupp (he has Locket but don’t think I can get him).
4577,2020-10-07 05:34:56,j64vx1,If Gibson remains consistent and gets more receiving work this would be great for you. Eventually Ekeler should come back and put a dent in Kelley’s numbers so I think in the long run Gibson is better. As someone with Hines on their bench I hope he starts to produce more but I wouldn’t really hold your breath bar an injury or some crazy breakout.
4578,2020-10-07 05:31:04,j64vx1,"That’s tough, I prefer RBs for a safer floor but Chark and Boyd have high ceilings."
4579,2020-10-07 05:28:55,j64vx1,"At this point, Gibson has been trending up and had a breakout game against his toughest opponent yet. Meanwhile, Drake has been underperforming and couldn’t get it done against the Panthers and underplayed against the Lions based on his ADP. The Jets matchup is tempting for Drake but in my opinion you’re just playing Drake based on matchup and a hope that he finally plays up to his potential like Mixon last week. I’ll admit it’s a tough call but Gibson at least has shown consistency and improvement. With Gibson trending up and Drake trending down I’d feel safer going with Gibson. I’m going to be rooting for you mad hard this week though man. 0-4 sucks."
4580,2020-10-08 11:33:57,j64vx1,"Im thinking of the same trade, opposite sides, it seems fair."
4581,2020-10-07 04:43:41,j64vx1,"Go big, he might be a league changer for you.  What % are you thinking?

Let us know how it goes in the morning!"
4582,2020-10-08 21:41:09,j64vx1,Update: Feel like I fucked up 😂. I mean i got zeke and carson..and my receivers are lamb golladay and robby anderson. Could be worse i guess
4583,2020-10-06 15:04:18,j64vx1,"I definitely would start Hunt over him. I'm on the fence with him and Taylor, I'm making the exact same decision."
4584,2020-10-07 05:55:22,j64vx1,I think you have to start hunt with how much the browns are relying on the run.
4585,2020-10-06 18:23:48,j64vx1,"Someone in my 10 team 0.5 PPR league is trying to get my McLaurin for his Gibson. Problem is we start 3 WR and a flex.    
    
My WRs: Davante, McLaurin, John Brown, Marvin Jones, Gage, and Hardman.    
My RBs: Henry, MG3, Mostert, Fournette
    
I’m thinking I’m pretty balanced, and should probably look to upgrade at WR or RB using one of Josh Allen or Aaron Rodgers instead. (It’s also a 6pt per passing TD league).     
     
What do you think?"
4586,2020-10-06 16:16:02,j64vx1,Well ekeler is going on IR. So yea probably
4587,2020-10-06 16:17:45,j64vx1,">Ekeler

isn't he hurt?"
4588,2020-10-06 19:44:02,j64vx1,[deleted]
4589,2020-10-06 18:25:47,j64vx1,There are dozens of hype trains every year.  You just got lucky and hitched to the right ones.  This sub is as stupid as ever lol
4590,2020-10-06 19:12:42,j64vx1,Now get Tanyard as your TE and you’ll be unstoppable as the hype created by your team will force your opponents to forfeit
4591,2020-10-06 20:36:42,j64vx1,"Still need to see Kelley ""take off"" but nice work grabbing the rest of em.  Should get a clear picture with him this weekend."
4592,2020-10-06 14:27:46,j64vx1,"Robinson was more of a hype rocket. Amazing start, let’s just hope he doesn’t run out of fuel on the way to the moon."
4593,2020-10-06 18:14:48,j64vx1,I lost Mack and Saquon and have been starting both of them.
4594,2020-10-06 14:10:40,j64vx1,"No idea. My RBs are now Mixon, Sanders, Taylor, Gibson, Kelley, Harris and Dobbins and my WRs are Adams, Golladay, Kupp, Diontae and Edelman though so I’m loving life😂"
4595,2020-10-06 14:49:57,j64vx1,No.. it was during the middle of the Rams game when Kupp had like 2 catches. I was caught off guard to say the least
4596,2020-10-06 15:26:22,j64vx1,"Vetoing isn’t for trades you don’t like. Vetoing is only to stop cheating. 

People like you are why some leagues don’t trade at all."
4597,2020-10-06 15:21:44,j64vx1,i cant say i disagree but you wouldnt turn it down lol..... this is far from the worst trade in this league too if you believe it
4598,2020-10-06 16:02:57,j64vx1,Interesting move depending on your record and league playoff format
4599,2020-10-06 21:14:10,j64vx1,"Yeah I took him in the 70s knowing that it would be awhile before he finally took off, all the signs were there and im glad I took him. Especially with the rb apocalypse"
4600,2020-10-06 18:01:09,j64vx1,"Haha, maybe I should consider a name change. I have all three. Along with Justin Jefferson."
4601,2020-10-07 19:09:23,j64vx1,Nice
4602,2020-10-06 16:30:26,j64vx1,"I would love to, but I feel Drake's value is too low to acquire more atm haha.  I may have a decision to make!"
4603,2020-10-06 15:05:10,j64vx1,"As a Georgia fan, I feel bad for the situation Swift is in. I just imagine how great he would be on the Chiefs."
4604,2020-10-06 20:05:03,j64vx1,"Oof. So true. Barry Sanders was a star despite the Lions lol

There's a [really interesting article](https://www.sbnation.com/2019/10/24/20917771/barry-sanders-rushing-yards-touchdowns-detroit-lions-dorktown) about how so many of his TDs got vultured. The data is unreal"
4605,2020-10-07 15:16:53,j64vx1,Being a lions fan is like having every player score bust except the kicker. Week after week. Year after year.
4606,2020-10-06 15:09:20,j64vx1,"Honestly if even one other person in your league is sharp, it completely alters the strategy you have to take when making your selections

Sometimes you have to reach well beyond the general ADP to get your guy, but if the upside is there it can prove well worth it (as it did here)"
4607,2020-10-06 14:59:29,j64vx1,"No I couldn't lol, chick in my league was ready to take him in the 7th

If I waited longer, she would have him and I would have missed out on a starting RB"
4608,2020-10-06 15:00:18,j64vx1,"A girl in my league was ready to take him in the 7th. He's a starting RB

If I hadn't taken Gibson in the 6th, I would have lived to regret it"
4609,2020-10-06 20:39:43,j64vx1,Thanks.
4610,2020-10-06 15:07:28,j64vx1,Would you trade him for Chubb if you don’t need to start him?
4611,2020-10-06 14:33:53,j64vx1,Wents sux
4612,2020-10-07 12:32:04,j64vx1,thanks i’m pretty happy with it. should add that the trade was with the saquon manager in my league and we were dancing around a trade for a couple of weeks before he made me a great offer. we now have the two highest projections in our league by far so hoping its a win win long term
4613,2020-10-06 23:24:48,j64vx1,"That is exactly what I was lookung to hear, thanks a lot! At least the browns backfield is gonna be a bit more predictable in the forseeable future..."
4614,2020-10-06 16:56:51,j64vx1,If you need WR and are heavy at RB it makes sense. But if you need a flex or an RB2 it would be tough to part with Gibson.
4615,2020-10-07 04:54:20,j64vx1,"Started at 20% and have gradually worked up to like 30%. First year doing faab in our league so no one really knows what’s going on, makes it unpredictable"
4616,2020-10-06 19:27:39,j64vx1,"I would absolutely stay put. Gibson we may have seen his ceiling, mclaurin we are seeing his floor. Alex smith would be a huge boost to mclaurin and Gibson but mclaurin more. Especially with 3 WRs."
4617,2020-10-06 21:38:21,j64vx1,uh mostert on waivers? wtf this cant be a money league...
4618,2020-10-07 02:35:16,j64vx1,That is a non competitive league. Embarrassing brag lol.
4619,2020-10-06 18:30:18,j64vx1,Trey Burton hype train derailed a few years back. I've decided to take the hype helicopter since then.
4620,2020-10-06 19:22:42,j64vx1,"Guy in my league has Kamara, Jones, and Hunt. I assume he might not forfeit."
4621,2020-10-06 15:14:47,j64vx1,"The hype rocket has easily left orbit. He had a 40 yard run called back, and didn't score a touchdown and still put up 13 points. He also controlled 100% of the teams RB touches. He's THE league winner this year."
4622,2020-10-06 14:44:29,j64vx1,"Ah, the 6 team league where you drafted Adams in the 3rd and Mostert in the 6th"

Vetos should be for collusion.  If a trade is too sloppy taco one sided then stop inviting tacos into the league or be faster at trading the taco."

4630,2020-10-06 15:42:35,j64vx1,I think he will perform well in time; Lions are just easing him into the league and giving him opportunities.
4631,2020-10-06 15:41:19,j64vx1,y'all telegraph draft picks or something?  and i guess this must be after AP was cut?

So it would be more so a, “can Henry and DJ carry my team until Chubb is back.”

I think if Chubb is back in 6 weeks and I got 3-3 those weeks and am at 6-4 I make playoffs and win the league. Anything below .500 in that time and I’m in trouble."
4634,2020-10-07 05:00:58,j64vx1,"Depends on your record, and how much you've spent thus far, but in my head it was 33% so you're probably in the sweet spot.  FAAB is so much better but it definitely takes a season or two to normalize.  Two years ago I went ""big"" for a RB at 22%, lost when a leaguemate went 33%.  Following week, a bit more desperate, it went closer to 50% and one when the closest guy was at 4%.  Roll with it, study your league's needs and budgets.  Fun part of the game."

Kittle owner proposed Kittle, Diggs and Hunt for Gurley and McLaurin right after the draft and then i flipped Diggs and Hunt for Mixon before Mixon signed."
4638,2020-10-06 18:06:50,j64vx1,People were complaining about Joe Mixon early in the Bengals game. Imagine if someone got fed up and sent out a Mixon trade that got accepted.

I felt so confident with nearly exact same draft if we swapped Davante with Chub. Week one ESPN had me projected as #1, I'm 0-4 so far lol. Robinson isn't gonna be enough in some leagues, and the many teams/ deep benches are keeping the WW super thin. Rough start in a new league, I'm gonna propose some changes for next year."
4647,2020-10-07 06:06:53,j64vx1,"There’s no way. No one is trading Kittle, Diggs, and Hunt for Gurley and Terry. This guy is full of it."

4649,2020-10-06 19:59:34,j64vx1,"Yeah, I still have hope. My bench is decent w/ Gurley, Gaskins, McKinnon at RB and Chark, Crowder, Jonnu, Hollywood as receiving threats.  I have the potential, just been a real slow start.  I just have to dog the WW to stay in it."

##6. No Memes, except on Meme Day

► Memes can be funny, but as they can be made in a very short amount of time with little effort, there’s a growing trend with subreddits that allow them in which quality content is drowned out by memes or quick jokes. As a result, outside of Meme Day, memes are not allowed as submissions on the subreddit. They are however a perfect candidate for comment replies, and we encourage them in this respect.

4653,2020-10-06 12:07:39,j63bwf,"Awesome write up. I've been interested in London crime  and the swinging 60's for years. At times its hard to differentiate between the good guys and the bad guys and the police weren't the good guys a lot of the time. 
Ill try and dig out a link to a site that delves into corrupt coppers and soho. 
The rumour abut him being the serial killer was one that made me think "" hmmmm hang on"". It was a very interesting time to be in London whatever you think lol"
4654,2020-10-06 13:45:32,j63bwf,"Great write up.

I can't see how someone would have been able to murder him in the car with the rifle - if Mills was in the back seat a killer would gave to sit in a front seat and turn round to shoot Mills. All without waking him up. Slightly more likely is someone taking the rifle then waking Mills who was asleep in the car. If Mills wound down the window to talk to this person he could have been shot through the eye.

I think this was suicide though - I can't see any gangster trying to murder a paranoid ex boxing champ who carried a rifle with them by trying to get the rifle off them without noticing then shoot them with it. Far easier to shoot Mills with your own gun through the window whilst he slept or pick another time when his guard was down.

He might have shot himself through the eye as this was a small calibre rifle and he figured through the eye was the easiest way to put a bullet in his brain."
4655,2020-10-06 14:44:32,j63bwf,">In 1954, he had been knocked unconscious during a comedy sketch when  another performer hit him over the head with a real stool, rather than a prop stool. This seemed to make existing problems he’d already had with  his head and spine even worse. He suffered from frequent headaches and  dizziness from this point.

How did that happen? Was it an accident or intentional?"
4656,2020-10-06 18:48:11,j63bwf,"Thanks for an interesting write up! Just as a really minor point, the London district is Soho (SoHo is the district in New York). I hadn't realised he was found dead in Goslett Yard - I was having a pint there a few weeks before lockdown."
4657,2020-10-06 11:58:49,j63bwf,"Excellent write-up, thanks!"
4658,2020-10-06 12:32:46,j63bwf,Murder Mile had a couple of episodes on this case.
4659,2020-10-06 21:03:31,j63bwf,"That’s a great write up, I grew up in Bournemouth in the 80s and remember coming across a memorial in the Gardens and then looking into his story a little bit. 
I was back there in the summer but couldn’t locate the memorial; I wonder if it’s been moved or is simply not there anymore."
4660,2020-10-06 17:15:25,j63bwf,Brilliant write up thanks... fascinating
4661,2020-10-06 12:15:12,j63bwf,https://www.google.com/amp/s/scepticpeg.wordpress.com/2016/08/30/the-soho-connections-a-z-of-whos-who/amp/
4662,2020-10-09 10:26:54,j63bwf,Wow amazing write up! You did really well. Thank you !
4663,2020-10-15 07:02:33,j63bwf,Mick and Keith?
4664,2020-10-06 13:13:33,j63bwf,The idea that he was Jack the Stripper seems so blatantly ridiculous and created to sell headlines that I'm surprised how many people wanted to believe it.
4665,2020-10-06 13:52:19,j63bwf,"I think this issue is what makes the case so weird - there's too much evidence and also not enough. There is definite evidence that elements of the scene were tampered with and the family are right to notice how weird it is for someone to shoot themselves through the eye - not with the gun pressed against the lid, but against the eye itself. However, moving a gun around in a car is difficult and while he may have appeared happy on the surface, there is no knowing what exactly he was thinking on the days leading up to his death."
4666,2020-10-06 15:07:21,j63bwf,"From what I understand, it was just a complete accident. It's worth remembering that nearly all TV was live at this point - it would be difficult to double check whether you were grabbing the prop stool or a real stool while trying to keep the show going and without making the gag obvious to the audience."
4667,2020-10-06 22:43:54,j63bwf,"A top boxer from the 70s called Jerry Quarry had a horribly ill-advised comeback in 1992. He fought an absolute scrub in a barn in the ass end of nowhere and took a 6 round hiding. He was already suffering from early dementia and had no business being anywhere near a fight. 

After that his dementia went from early to end stage. He declined over a period of hours days and weeks after the fight. 

Seems like something similar might have happened to Freddy after he got brained with the stool.  

A head injury like that could kill a man without already having brain damage."
4668,2020-10-06 19:50:35,j63bwf,"Quite- the capital H is a reference to the Manhattan neighborhood being South of Houston Street, which for obvious reasons isn't applicable for the London neighborhood."
4669,2020-10-06 12:04:20,j63bwf,Thank you! I was a bit nervous about posting - there are so many great creators here - but I just think it's such an interesting case that more people should know about it.

4673,2020-10-06 14:07:45,j63bwf,"I think the rifle being moved to the footwell might have happened when his body was first discovered - no one wanting to fake a suicide scene would do that. As he often slept in the car with the rifle it might not have been obvious on first look that he had shot himself and someone tried to move him or 'wake' him.

Its a really interesting story in its own right, but the UK 'Krays industry' fuels a lot of unlikely stories to try and connect them to the Krays."
4674,2020-10-06 19:51:28,j63bwf,And a good hunk of British television was very much on the fly in that era- note the story about how a production had to improve around an actor suddenly dying during a live program.
4675,2020-10-08 03:02:26,j63bwf,That story about Jerry Quarry sounds really sad.
4676,2020-10-09 13:06:12,j63bwf,I will definitely read!
4677,2020-10-06 21:42:44,j63bwf,"More than that, even if someone wanting to fake a suicide might have forgotten to get Mills' prints on the rifle, they certainly wouldn't wipe it clear of prints.  But if the people who discovered his body didn't realize he was dead at first, and suddenly no one's sure that nobody touched the rifle?  That's a *very* good reason to wipe it down, even if you aren't aiming to cover up a suicide."
4678,2020-10-08 06:22:19,j63bwf,"By 1999 he was dead.

Bill Russell would *hate* being on a team with a bunch of iso guys. They'd be good on defense, but Bill would be wasted and everybody would all be taking turns isoing on offense.

Half of Not the Clippers are ball dominant guys and the other half are hard-nosed team first stars.

And Doomed is a decent team, but they just wouldn't have the defense or the offense to beat the Ballers or The Horace Grant Express."
4683,2020-10-06 14:35:49,j5vyu5,"It has to be the Horace Grant Express. Their starting lineup is almost as good as the Ballers (and would be better in some scenarios if not for the shaky spacing).  However, having the luxury of bringing one of the 5 best defenders ever in DRob off the bench, as well as one of the absolute best offensive initiators in Nash just puts this team above the rest.

She also called her daughter a fucking liberal last week... These people have been brainwashed to hate the people who actually will give them what they want. She thinks liberal agendas are tax the middle class and let illegals take your jobs.. when in reality they are trying to do exactly what she/they want. It's mind boggling.

What is the appropriate response?

Forget and forgive will lead right back to Trump 2.0 in 2024.

I'm sorry, but Dems need to take the gloves off and secure democracy.  I'm not saying bash red states.  But the political ratfucking needs to be undone and corrected if democracy is to survive.  Of course, GOP will cry foul.  They will perceive it as getting punched in the face (while also not perceiving all the punching they've been doing).  It must be ignored.

I can even disagree with dyed in wool libertarians who are all about small government. And I can definitely disagree with conservatives who aren't interventionalists and hate war hawks (basically if Tucker Carlson wasn't a xenophobic asshole).

But when those groups say they will vote for a racist piece of shit just to own the other side or ignore all of the abhorrent things he's done, yeah that's when you lose me. If there was a progressive candidate who was a blatant racist, I wouldn't vote for them to ""own the conservatives"". I think it's perfectly ok to turn your back on somebody who knowingly voted for a racist. If you don't like both candidates, you have the choice of abstaining from that race."

Not once did he talk about Q, deep state, rigged anything, Hunter Biden or any other trash fire conspiracy theory. He did what any normal American would do and voted for the candidate who he believed advanced his interests. I can absolutely get behind that and value him highly as a friend. My dad also voted for Trump and I suspect he dabbles in the conspiracies and may have fully fallen down the hole. But he never brings it up in polite company, he doesn't shove it down your throat or gets into long arguments. As inexplicable as I think their choices are, they serve as everyday reminders that not everyone who voted for him is a frothing, pants-on-head lunatic. It's real easy to get lost in the bullshit and too many people are all too willing to throw their own dignity out the window to 'win' or prove a point. But not all of them are. Cherish the sane people in your life, even if you don't agree with them."

It had everything to do with stopping a dictatorship that was not only authoritarian, but also extremely racist. I am not saying that we hate people of the other political persuasion, but it is IMPARITIVE that we educate the other side on what was really happening. I guess I just wanted to express that this was not about different political views, but rather extremism that not only endangered our republic and our way of life, but had the potential to upset the balance of the entire planet, sending everything into chaos and potentially leading us down such a dark path that may take generations to recover.

Then started out as a wrestler but didn't like it, was a huge star and became the the biggest movie star in world. Other than football he became the biggest at his craft.

The man has charisma for days, he spent years having capacity crowds hanging on his every word.  He turned a corny insult like ""roody-poo candy ass"" into something 18,000 people would scream in unison with him.

He is a genuinely good, nice person.  He is very active on social media, is always spreading positive and uplifting messages, is a devoted family man and father, and has lived a life basically devoid of controversy and scandal.

He's a dynamo.  He goes 100% at all times, and is constantly pushing himself to be and do better.  I would imagine he'd throw himself into the world of politics with the same fervor as he did wrestling and Hollywood.

And liberals are starting to see Republicans as the enemy now too (understandably so, after years of being called the enemy and four years of Trump's insanity being backed by the party).

It's time for that to stop. You can't have a functional country when half the people believe the other half are the enemy.

And racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia just pushed the enemy narrative further. It others the left for Republicans. It too has to stop and they have to accept that they live in a diverse country and learn some tolerance at least. Set an example for the racists who support them and those racists will die away."

I love most of your comment, but I think this is an especially important point.  When people talk about reducing polarization my first thought is about how obvious it is that having a party base its platform on contrarianism would lead to polarization.

Right now, anyone who voted Trump gets labeled as the farthest right caricature possible. Racist, xenophobic, transphobic. Aoc wants their name on a list. Left wants people to harass them and them to lose their jobs. 

The overwhelming vast majority of those people are really pretty center. They want some abortions and they want third term abortions banned. They want a path to citizenship but actual borders to stop drugs and child trafficking. 

But if you want those you’re labeled as part of the evil racists by places like ..... all of reddit. That’s what got trump elected in the first place. 

We first have to realize there is a HUGE problem in the democrat party. There’s a reason they thought they’d win house seats and they lost them instead. The average American. The normal person working a 9-5, is absolutely sick of this “abolish the police and if you don’t a agree you’re a racist sack of shit” commentary that’s all over Reddit, twitter, facebook and 99% of the msm."

I agree with your premise and idea. But as someone who’s always considered myself to be a moderate liberal and who agrees with more policies from the democrats (or at least used to) I’ve absolutely hated the decisive hate filled rhetoric from the left: you simply can’t go around and scream racism/sexism/xenophobia at the everyone with a different view and convince yourself all their views are hateful and bigoted. This isn’t a defense of the right or denying that Trump spews hateful BS none sense as well, but the left has been the driving force of this ever since Trump got elected.

It’s easy now that Biden is the president to call for unity and peace, but how well do you think the 70 million Americans who have been demeaned, berated, and screamed at the last 4 years feels about that?"

4942,2020-11-09 08:40:55,jqqw71,"Most of politics is not opinion, its fact. Opinion: Abortions are murder. 

The real fact behind policy regardless of opinion: Abortions go down with access to birth control and abortion numbers are barely affected by illegality. It just makes them dangerous.

In this case a person’s political opinion is irrelevant to the facts. I could believe that a fetus is a clump of cells or that they are babies flesh and blood. To get the least amount of abortions possible, you can do XYZ. 

That is how all policy in any nation should work. There are very few if any true dueling political opinions in the world."

Fixing America is more about changing minds than it ever has been recently. Russia's goal was to divide America, and it succeeded. The idea of ""turning your back"" on the ""others"" plays directly into that. America needs its people to come together, not increase that division, because the election was just too damned close just to turn your back on what turned out to be very close to 50% of the population. They will vote again, and they will vote the same way again if they're not embraced as people whose minds can change."

4965,2020-11-09 14:18:54,jqqw71,"Very true. But throughout American history there has been a gradual progression and change to all of our political parties, and I think we've seen a very rampant one over the past 20 years, which actually echoes the changes over the past 100 or so years. FDR and Truman adopting a civil rights platform alienated the Dixiecrats/Deep South Dems. LBJ signing the Civil Rights Act solidified that change and paved the way for the republican's Southern Strategy in the 70s and 80s.

In 2000, muslim Americans were by and large republican because their social views tended to be aligned with republicans. At the time, Dwayne Johnson not only appeared in the GOP convention but also campaigned for Bush and was a registered republican. The Bush/Cheney response 9/11 and the republican realignment that followed had an impact of alienated many muslim and Asian voters. That turned into a stronger anti-immigrant stance (which was actually present in the republican party since around the 1870s). I think we saw during the Obama administration an uptick in non-white racism within the republican party, which neither McCain nor Romney agreed with, and which Trump was able to capitalize.

Johnson is American-Samoan, and that block had been largely republican for a long time. But this trend has alienated many non-whites who have been accepted into the democratic party on its outlook of racial inclusion. I think now its safe to say that Johnson is apart of that natural shift."
4966,2020-11-09 14:44:31,jqqw71,"There is really no comparing the Republican party or the average Republican voter of 2000 to the Trump movement.  American politics has had a dramatic shift in the past 8-12 years. There are millions of people who voted for Obama in one or both of his elections that are now Trump supporters.  For instance, Obama won Indiana in 2008, which is considered to be a Republican stronghold. When Obama entered office, the democrats had control of both houses of Congress.

Politics has changed drastically and so have many people's party affiliations."

And as much as we don't like it, hate speech is protected speech.

The forces of bigotry must be eliminated, there is no doubt about that. But the solution to that problem is not legislation. There is a social process that needs to occur, but our communities sequester themselves into their own private corners of the world.

I agree that demonization is a real problem, but the problem is that an *honest*, *non-embellished* description of many of the GOP voter's political ideas is extremely uncharitable. At a minimum, a huge number are deeply enraged that their society is being taken over by nonwhites and queers that *don't deserve* the success that they have. They openly laugh when their police murder us, they support wantonly cruel and arbitrary enforcement of laws that hurt people of color, and have basically no interest in making the USA a decent place for everyone to live.

That doesn't describe *every* Trump voter, but the problem is that it does describe a plurality of them, and the rest don't care enough to worry about the truly hateful ones- so practically they might as well all feel the same way. 

How do I bridge that gap? How do get someone to *not* be who they are? And more to the point, why is it the responsibility of minorities and the left to try and un-fuck a huge number of perfectly capable adults (hint: it isn't). 

As far as I can tell, 70M people have forgotten what America is supposed to be (and I am well aware that we never have been, but still). The only possible solution I can see is that we have to be at every ballot box, every court case, drowning out their voices and blocking them from having any say it what goes on. Until they learn to respect others, I refuse to respect them, plain and simple. 

Is it an undemocratic opinion? Probably. But I refuse to live somewhere that will vote away my legal personhood when I have already contributed more to the society than any three of them.

Would they be encouraging their voters to be respectful and kind to the other side? Of course not, because they are ghouls who want to corrupt everyone they can, and do away with the ones they can't.

Far-right ideology in history has *never* been able to persist as a consistent element of a plural democracy, because it is inherently destabilizing. The only way they get followers is by scaring people into believing their position in society (such as it is) is being threated by ""them"", and they must act now to defend it. This is not an ideology compatible with loving your neighbor, or compromising, or bipartisanship. It's in the very DNA of what they think- they are in the correct lane, and everyone else who opposes them isn't just wrong, but morally reprobate and hell-bent on destroying the country.

You cannot debate a fascist, or compromise, or accomodate them. They must be deplatformed and prevented from speaking to wide audiences, as their rherotic *fucking works*. When they do gain office, they have to be explicitly labeled as what they are, and subjected to nonstop stonewalling and constant attention being drawn to the most unpleasant parts of their ideology, until they are forced out entirely.

Democracy cannot coexist with fascists- either democracy wins, or the fascists do. It has to be beaten, soundly and openly, and the education system reformed to explain *why* that ideology can never be permitted to take hold again. 

The good news is that most people swept up in fascism are just that- swept up. Without their leaders and a media machine to perpetuate their false narrative of the world, the individual believers who aren't fully invested tend to leave swiftly."

Don't hold your breath. ""Conservative"" economics comes entirely down to profiting as much from society as possible while taking as little responsibility for it as possible.

""Conservatism"" = technically legal criminality. Exploiting people for profit will never yield an ""amazing economic plan"" that isn't exploitative and manipulative."
5145,2020-11-09 12:59:29,jqqw71,">But if they have some amazing economic plan, and it's shown to actually work if they pass one,

Which is a nice thought, but Conservative Neoliberal economic policy is fundamentally flawed because it is not sustainable as its trickle-down, free-market, austerity theories are opposed to the idea of government regulation, spending, and investment for the public good.

We've had five decades of Neoliberal economics and it has consistently led to the erosion of our democracy, loss of consumer rights, corruption, monopolization, rising poverty, loss of economic mobility,  environmental destruction, cultural degradation, political disenfranchisement, an explosion in public and private debt, destruction of social cohesion and civil order as result of economic stagnation and instability, the privatization of state services and assets, and the spread of illness and disease.

There's no social ill that fiscal Conservatism does not contribute to or cause, it is a lethal threat to America.

The problem with many Liberals is that they are economically illiterate and that needs to change, because for too long have they allowed Conservatives to control our economy.

If you want to learn more about economics start following some economists who focus on critique and reform of the current system, here's a short list.

It is those people the dems have to reach in the upcoming elections if they want senators from Georgia, and if they want the 2022 elections. 

People just enjoy branding their opposition, they get a kick out of thinking of themselves as resistance fighters against racist fascist oppressors, and it is completely contrary to the message the president elect is pushing for of unity and seeing one's political opponents as fellow Americans you disagree with, not as enemies. Qanon or white supremacist or whatever shitstains go ahead and drag them through the shit, it is deserved, I just wish reddit would learn not to sling mud at people whose voices they will need in working towards positive policies.

5227,2020-11-09 17:08:24,jqqw71,"Republicans are more or less the American Conservative Party. 

Conservatism in the US is going to essentially be a blend of 'American traditions', patriotism/nationalism, and 'individualism'. So what that means, more or less, would be moral universalism, Americanized Christian values, pro-business, strong national defense, pro-agriculture, American exceptionalism, etc. 

That's a long way of saying so much of their policy [is tied to moral universalism](https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/party-affiliation/#belief-in-absolute-standards-for-right-and-wrong-trend) (which is to say that right and wrong doesn't differ from culture to culture) and that the policies can shift drastically to uphold their view on what's good and what's bad. For example, conservatism is a pro-market party, typically. They talk about how the markets decide winners, losers, etc when they want to slash regulation. But [really](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-republicans-have-a-long-history-of-protectionism-2018-06-14), the GOP has a long-standing history with tariffs, and conservatives praise Trump for standing up for American industry and agriculture through the trade wars, even though, in the case of soybeans, they [didn't really do much](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/agriculture/102920-soybean-prices-slide-on-chinas-demand-pause-covid-19-resurgence-sources#:~:text=China's%20demand%20for%20US%20soybeans,27%2C%20according%20to%20Platts%20data.) after hitting [pre-trade war prices](https://www.wsj.com/articles/soybean-prices-hit-two-year-high-buoyed-by-chinese-demand-11600442022) a couple of months ago. How can they hold these seemingly hypocritical views? Well, because China's bad and the US is good, duh. So they want free trade when it benefits us, and they want tariffs and protectionism when it benefits us. They don't *actually* think the markets are better than price-fixing from the government. They just want things to be better for businesses, better for America as some sort of ambiguous concept. 

As for the racism, bigotry, and the like? 

That stems from decades and centuries of religious and traditional thinking, refusing to change that thinking when others did, and then weaponizing that thinking in a handful of ways. Steve King was born in 1949. Trump was born in 1946. The Civil Rights Act was signed in 1964. These are men who were born into a time when segregation wasn't only legal, it was expected. They were brought up from a young age in a society that looked at Black people and other POC as lesser. Their churches said so. Their parents said so. And the most important part -- *these men refused to change* when the rest of the country did. Not just those two, of course, but all of the racists. The Republican party started getting more and more right-wing as time went on, and people Thurmond and Helms moved to the Republican Party. Guys like King, Trump, Graham, and others have kept joining. Honestly, if you want to see how the party transformed as guys like Thurmond and Helms moved in, look no further than [Mitch McConnell](https://newrepublic.com/article/113181/mitch-mcconnell-civil-rights-crusader-regrets). Mitch attended civil rights rallies (including the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom) and John Sherman Cooper was a big influence on his early political career. Now he's a husked out shell who only cares about wins in the R column. 

Christianity and American tradition have been used as justifications for bigotry and racism for basically as long as the US has existed, but the Christian Right is a relatively recent political movement that kinda got started in the 1940s, but it took off in the 1970s. I'd argue it was adopted, in large part, because guys like Helms and Thurmond could hide behind things that *sound* good. This would also give the party a bloc of voters who would start by just voting on a single issue or two, but would eventually (and through the next generation) associate their religion with their politics, subconsciously implanting the idea that Republican policies are 'right' because the Republican Party is associated with God and church and Sundays and, of course, tradition. 

So now, even though almost everyone in American politics claims Christianity (88% of the 116th Congress, haven't had even a nontrinitarian POTUS in over 100 years and Lincoln and Jefferson are the closest to non-Christian (Deists/Unitarians) or question marks with a good handful of Christian Unitarians (Adams, Adams, Washington, Fillmore, Taft)), the religion is intrinsically linked to the Republican Party by a bloc of voters, and the party wields that like a cudgel. Bigotry now more than racism, but both are still justified by the party, just less overtly. 

So really, I don't think they *can* cut that out anymore. It's deeply linked, and the people who want to be politicians in the Republican Party tend to subscribe to many of the beliefs and want to further them. There are exceptions, of course, but it's not as simple as ignoring that stuff with at least [80% of your party being Christian](https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/compare/christians/by/party-affiliation/) and a large chunk ([probably about 60% of the party](https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/party-affiliation/#importance-of-religion-in-ones-life-trend)) of that wanting their political party to be expressly Christian (but in the way they think of it as Christian, not the way the Democratic Christians are Christians). I mean, maybe they could cut out the racism, even some of the more subtle bits, but we're going to need to see a large number of new potential politicians and see a lot of the old ones kicked out, but considering it took until this year to get Steve King out (and it really only happened because King openly asked why the terms 'white nationalist' and 'white supremacy' were bad and got kicked off of his committee assignments), well, I'm not optimistic."

It isn't really a question of political opinions anymore, we are at a juncture where the GOP agenda lies at cross-purposes to *my* civil rights, and the rights of most of my family and friends. One ""side"" of the political debate doesn't agree that all citizens deserve equal protection, and wants to actively work to rescind said protections that do exist. And that's not even addressing that they want to implement tax and healthcare policies that will lead to more death and suffering than necessary.

Honest question, as decent, respectful people, how are we supposed to react to them? Do we stand by and *let* them do whatever they want, no matter the cost? I don't want to be in a place where they have the ability to do that, it has to stop before then, or people are going to suffer for it.

The problem is that, by all evidence, about 40-45% of the country *wants* it to happen, and votes accordingly. I don't see any plausible future that doesn't involve *somebody's* wishes for society not being respected, and given a choice between which side gets its way, I'm leaning for the one that won't strip my legal rights and protections.

And before you go on with the ""no true Christian"" bullshit, it'd argue that the reasonable, moderate Christians are just as much to blame for the power of these corrupt preachers.

You nice Christians give them cover to hide their hate. They get to tell their low IQ congregation ""look how many people believe! Clearly it's true! Now, go vote for Trump!""

Religion should be ridiculed and laughed at for the bullshit that it is. For the obvious lies and falsehoods it propagates. There is no ""nice"" version of religion, because you give it power no matter how little of it you cheery pick."

anti-lgbt i can kinda get (despite being lgbt), since lgbt is a modern way of conceptualizing that population of people, so people have to come to their own interpretation. 

when you're interpreting passages like:

>And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.

it's pretty easy to see why some people conclude god is anti-lgbt. though many people interpret this one differently in context (either as referring to ""prostitution"" or to ""sex rituals"" used in ""pagan worship,"" which isn't necessarily that much better than denouncing lgbt people), but i notice many christians like to take passages out of context like this and then speculate about what it means, which can easily reinforce an existing anti-lgbt bias."

5301,2020-11-09 07:55:36,jqqw71,"The problem is nobody can ever seem to agree. 

For example when Obama took over I think everyone agreed the economy sucked. Now there were different reasons or excuses depending on what party you were involved in but everyone agreed the economy sucked. 

So Obama comes in and lowers unemployment and the stock market shoots to record highs. Democrats said ""the economy is good again"" and then listed low unemployment and the stock market as reasons. Now I think most people would point to these two things as signs of a healthy economy. However Republicans came along and said ""thats not true, the REAL unemployment number is this and people aren't being counted"". 

So after a few years of that Trump enters office. The economy is still growing like crazy. The stock market gets even HIGHER and the unemployment gets down to its lowest point since the 1960's. Not a single Republican's ever said ""yeah but the REAL unemployment number is this"". They never used the phrase again ever. Magically it was gone. So now Republicans are pointing to the same thing Democrats were. Low unemployment, high stock market. So you would think FINALLY both sides will agree the economy is great. 

Well Democrats didn't agree. Then they started saying ""who cares how much the stock market makes thats the rich getting richer"" despite them using it as evidence of a strong economy under Obama. Then they moved to unemployment and said ""who cares how low it is, all the jobs are low paying jobs"". Democrats never said this once under Obama's administration. They never said ""who cares that he got unemployment low I'm starving having to work two jobs"". 

So even when two Presidents are doing the exact same thing in this case neither side can agree on it. Of course you got into other metrics. Some people said that Trump had trashed Obama's economy and that it would fail others said that Trump was still using Obama's economy. So Democrats couldn't even agree on if this was still Obama's economy or not. 

My biggest point is that even if something was shown to be good for the economy, the other side always says ""no its bad and here is why its bad"". Don't even get me started of fiscal responsibility and Ted Cruz trying to weasel his way around that. 

The economy was something that Trump was so popular with. He was so popular with the economy that even after COVID hit people still said they had more faith in Trump running the economy than Biden and before the pandemic his economy approval rating was great. Its safe to say most experts, and most citizens felt like it was a good economy under Trump for the first three years and even with that information Democrats still came up with a million reasons why it wasn't. So I don't think either side can ever just tell the other one ""you did good kid"" its just not in our DNA since the Clinton/Gingrich years."

I'm not sure if you thought I hadn't considered that?

You also lied or were not upfront (perhaps by accident), you said: ""They don't use government funding for abortions."". This is strictly true. But the reason it stopped is because of a new rule that would limit referrals ([NYT Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/health/planned-parenthood-title-x.html)). Before that they accepted federal funding and had the same books, as such any division was fabricated.

The new rule says:

>The department said that “while Title X providers are prohibited from referring for abortion as a method of family planning, **referral for abortion because of an emergency medical situation is not prohibited.**”  
>  
>It said providers may give pregnant women “a list of comprehensive health care providers (including prenatal care providers), including some (but not the majority) who perform abortion as part of a comprehensive health care practice. However, this list cannot serve as a referral for, nor identify those who provide abortion — and Title X providers cannot indicate those on the list who provide abortion.”  
>  
>**Because clinics receiving Title X money will no longer have to counsel women on all reproductive options, including abortion**, the new rule may make faith-based providers and others that oppose abortion eligible for funding — a change that could significantly alter the guidance patients receive.  
>  
>Organizations receiving Title X funds will still be able to perform abortions but will have to do so in a separate facility from their other operations and adhere to the new requirement that they not refer patients to it. Clinics have been prohibited for years from using federal money to finance abortion services, except in cases of rape, incest or when the pregnancy would endanger the woman’s life. The new rule goes a step further by ordering them to keep separate books for their abortion operations. Those changes are expected to take effect in 2020.

They are still allowed to talk about abortions, even having a list of referrals that do abortions. You're just not allowed to 'speedrun' an abortion by walking in and getting a referral to a place that only does abortions.

Besides this is a freedom of speech case ultimately. While I can agree that perhaps not being allowed to specifically refer to abortion-only clinics may be contentious, knowing that before you were legally obliged to advocate for abortions is disconcerting."

5311,2020-11-09 14:52:25,jqqw71,"Speaking from a lengthy review of literature surrounding political extremism and how plural societies turn hateful- you can't, not directly anyway. Weimer Germany was one of, if not *the* most socially open and accepting societies on the planet, with vibrant contributions to art, culture, and science. They still descended into fascism, and it didn't take that much.

Weimer Germany fell into fascism for a multitude of reasons, but among the biggest is that the powers that be were permitted to demonize individuals within the society as responsible for the issues the nation faced. This inevitably leads to *bad shit* happening to the scapegoats.

In the US, we have a problem, that is, our problem is that we have already reached a level of wealth, peace, and prosperity that the only reason we aren't a utopia is because we *choose* to distribute our resources in a haphazard and wildly unequal manner. Crime is at the lowest rates in modern history, for example- a far cry from the 1980s.

So where the fuck are all the Nazis from, if troubled societies produce them? Simple. Since the early 2000s, a media machine worth billions has been gradually slipped into the American consciousness, and it tells a big portion of the populace that things *are not* peaceful, that our cities are burning, borders flooded, and everything is on the constant verge of collapse. Right-wing media has built up deliberately falsified narratives and urgency in the minds of many, causing them to justify all kinds of responses in their mind, to a situation that never existed in the first place.

To radicalize, first you have to inspire great fear, shutting down the reasonable parts of the brain. Once people are scared, they will trust whomever is hocking solutions, no matter how unjust and illogical the ""answers"" may be.

This is the trap we are in. A big part of the country doesn't actually *know* much about the world. They believe crime is up (when it isn't), they believe immigrants cause poverty and crime (when they don't), they believe our oldest and closest allies are fleecing us on trade (they usually aren't), and most inaccurate of all, they believe their far-right politicians are the responsible adults in the room (when it is overwhelmingly the right who blows up the debt as well as starting unnecessary wars and fomenting terror abroad). *They literally live in a different, parallel world to our own, with radically different threats, incentives, and reasons to act*.

When a sizable chunk of the population believes the world is very different from the way it actually is, they are going to act consistently with that belief. The reason so many seemingly reasonable people are falling off a cliff is because they have been captured by far-right media, led to believe the world is very different and worse than it is, and then are sold a bevy of solutions to these new, entirely fabricated ""issues"". 

Worse, the intensity is ratcheting up. Notice how we went from Obama being secretly ineligible for office in 2008, to Democrats literally murdering children and drinking their blood in Satanic rituals? The more extreme the evil you are against, the more extreme *responses* you are able to justify. The forces manipulating these people are intentionally making things seem worse and ever more insane, to push their believers deeper into the cult and enable them to morally justify deeply reprehensible actions on their part.

This is an intentional and highly effective phenomenon that has been taking place for upwards of 20 years at this point. Our population is being socially engineered to become extremist assholes who will vote for whomever they are instructed to vote for.

How is this fixed? The same way it has been throughout history. First you have to unplug the hate machine- Murdoch's media empire and the dozens of copycats have to be dismantled, either taken offline entirely or reestablished with new content standards. Media has to become more honest, representative of reality, and optimistic in it's emotions, spreading a message that we *can* and *will* do good things for everyone.

Once the poison is shut off, the hate dies on it's own. America is diverse, nearly exceptionally so, and living here without the corrupting influence of far-right propaganda will inevitably soften and break the barriers that have been built up. But without stopping the misinformation at the source, *nothing* you say will beat out 40 hours a week of Fox News or OANN."

5317,2020-11-10 09:20:23,jqqw71,"No, you're missing my point.

Unless there's something else at work, most populations will follow a bell distribution curve for intelligence, height, weight, what have you. Just taking US citizens, the point in the middle would be the average intelligence. People clustered around that midpoint (whether they're just to the left or just to the right are considered 'average'). You have to be some distance to the left to be considered stupid and some distance to the right to be considered smart (i.e., 'stupid' doesn't start as soon as you're just to the left of the line).

Most US citizens will be centered around the average intelligence point at the midpoint, in a big hump that drops off sharply as you move further away to the right or left. At the far left are the really stupid people, and on the far right are the really smart ones. _Both of those extremes are **rare**_ compared to the bulk of the population clustered around the mid point.

Now, what this opinion about Republicans is saying is ""roughly 50% of the population is concentrated in a big hump, far to the left of the midpoint, **and** they're mostly Republicans"". Statistically, that's **vanishingly** unlikely -- which is why I say _that can't be the explanation_. It explains only a small percentage of them (and us, to be fair); for the rest, it's got to be something else.

You and I aren't working from the same set of working ""facts"" they are. To people like us, it seems like the only way they could continue to support their leaders at this point, is if they just _don't care_ about corruption, science-denial, autocratic rule, racism, attempts at election tampering, etc. Therefore, the thinking goes, all Republican party supporters must just be shitty, stupid people.

What it comes down to is - is it more important to you to understand it correctly, even if it's nuanced and complex, or do you want to just make a simple, quick, sweeping judgement that feels satisfying and then move on?"
5318,2020-11-10 08:47:23,jqqw71,"I agree with pretty much everything you've said here.

I completely agree that something close to 50% of US citizens have a very different set of working ""facts"", thanks to Fox news and Republican party leadership in general. I think that actually explains why so many otherwise decent people continue to show support - they have a completely different perception of reality than we do.

That was kind of my point. I realize that there are plenty of culpable bad actors on the right, but I'm seeing lots of people on the left saying effectively ""if you're a Republican/conservative, then you're a fundamentally bad person, and probably an idiot as well"".

I object to that sweeping oversimplification, not because ""feelings"", but because it _misses the point_. I think we're still in considerable danger as a nation, and missing the point adds to that danger.

That attitude works against countering polarization and extremism in the short term, and reduces the likelihood of recognizing and preventing this from happening again in the long term."

These are not mere policy points or minutiae- they want a fundamentally different (and less just) society, with a fundamentally different government. Judging by the reactions to this election, a plurality at least of the 70 million want a different electoral process too, one that doesn't involve so much pesky democracy.

I am not entirely sure anymore that this is fixable. I really thought four years of Trump would show people *why* rulers like him are bad for any civilized nation, but it didn't work. They somehow saw it and decided that was what they wanted.

I disagree with you somewhat here on this point.  ""*Christianity* is inherently authoritarian"", but it certainly isn't fair to say that *all Religion* is.

The reason Christianity is authoritarian is because *that* is the road it took.  A large number of religions in the world are focused on discovering the truth for yourself through mediation and prayer outside of a rigid structure.   These strains were *present* in Christianity, and were quite popular.    Its generally called Christian Mysticism, and you can see evidence of it in things like the [Heresy of the Free Spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mirror_of_Simple_Souls), or the [Gnostic Gospels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism).

Of course, people being able to find god on their own outside of a rigid church structure means that people *don't* need the Church itself.  So when the bible was crafted hundreds of years after Christ died, it was carefully selected from Gospels that would consolidate power into a central Church authority.  Gospels that did not consolidate power as such were deemed heretical and rooted out.   Christianity chose to become authoritarian in nature, and it enforced that through blood and fire.  

Authoritarianism is a Christian problem, but its not necessarily a religion problem- it certainly isn't a problem for more eastern religions like Buddhism or Hinduism, or more niche religions like Wicca. 

Honestly, the history of Christianity is really interesting... although I'm always amazed that anybody who knows Christianity's history can still follow that religion."

This is why the super wealthy invest in material assets that they can sell at a later date. It's the easiest way to retain or build wealth.

Despite the dollar losing value, however, the minimum wage has only increased by 30% in 20 years. To put that into perspective, the cost of housing has increased by 300% in the same time frame. Democrats want to double the minimum wage, because as it stands you cannot survive on $7.25 an hour. The single greatest cost in most households, housing, makes that all but impossible. Republicans on the other hand want to keep it low, because their reelection prospects hinge on billions of dollars in corporate funds, and the single greatest cost of most businesses is labor.

Further, I reject the idea that people voted for Trump because Democrats are too extreme somehow- the Democrats are an incredibly weak and self-serving lot with very few overarching principles and even less ability to coherently accomplish political goals when faced with any kind of opposition at all.

Rather, I think that the Democrats are going to have to do *realpolitik* the way that Republicans have for 20+ years now. 

They block appointments and steal court seats? The only way to fix the now semi-permanent imbalance is to break norms again and expand the court. Otherwise, you are just letting them get away with disproportionately enhancing their own power.

A similar theory applies to basically all their obstructionism. If they are going to irrationally block *literally everything*, including essential and uncontroversial items necessary for the continued operation of government, well, there is nothing you can do for that other than stepping on some toes and going over their heads.

They have successfully gerrymandered many states to the point that democracy is basically a joke in many red states, and Democrats need overwhelming majorities to achieve even remotely equal representation in many state chambers. Which is why (among other things) adding DC as a state is completely justified. 

And so on and so forth. The GOP isn't ever going to stop pushing limits, because right now they only benefit from doing so! If Democrats literally never retaliate, what incentive is there to go back to normalcy? 

The only way the insanity ends is when Republicans get reminded why norms and civility exist in the first place. If they never get hit back, they are never going to stop throwing shit our way. And given that their agenda and platform would bring material harm to millions, there is a moral *imperative* to oppose them.

Does that make more sense? It is sometimes hard to flesh out things in writing.

Edit: there is another factor too. The Democrats during Obama's last six years and for the last four till now have *already tried* negotiation, bipartisan overtures, and everything except hitting back in kind. What do we have to show for it? Scores of young, unqualified justices with lifetime appointments, appointed purely to obstruct anything the conservative elite deems counter to their vision.

So of course they are going to get angry or upset about that, and lash out at liberals.

5419,2020-11-09 15:14:03,jqqw71,"This point is something that I have made pretty clear to others in conversation (I also work mostly with Republicans), and it is surprisingly not something most people on the right are really ""on board"" with- debating isn't exactly something they appreciate within their circles, and dissent is harshly censored, which is a pretty steep contrast to the never-ending debate that permeates centrist and left-wing discourse.

A prime example, firearms are something I had shifted on from when I was younger (and amusingly *less* leftist than now). I have also shifted my opinions over time on a whole host of issues, as Iearn more information and adapt my worldview to fit what I know. I see learning as a process by which your internal view of the world asymptotically approaches the *actual* world, never quite getting there, but always striving for full knowledge and total understanding.

This requires you to constantly admit that you might be wrong, and limits how strongly you can push for your own ideas (in certain cases, not everything js a matter of debate). Humility and intellectual honesty are not easily compatible with conservative ideology, as conservative ideology prizes hierarchy, authority, and prescriptive, arbitrary standards of behavior. It actively encourages you *not* to look, because you might end up disagreeing with the in-group if you get too curious, and in-group cohesion is *the* paramount binding force for the right, and the far right especially.

Contrasting myself with my coworkers, we talk politics pretty often since most of them aren't the openly bigoted type, they are just run-of-the-mill Republicans. What I have noticed, to my eternal frustration, is that the right seems to have successfully conflated opinions with facts in their followers. 

I'll illustrate- three of us, myself, a moderately liberal colleague, and a more right-wing guy, were talking about general political stuff, and the conservative guy kept bringing up Russian interference in 2016, citing it as essentially a conspiracy theory the left still pushes ""even though they looked into and didnt find anything"". 

So of course, both of our response was to pull up the *bipartisan* Senate report that confirmed the interference did, in fact, take place- the extent of which still up for debate, but the actual events are not in question anymore, and there are Republicans attesting to it as well.

Without even skipping a beat, he immediately stated that ""well, but yeah, you know..."" and kinda trailed off a little bit. Only a few minutes later, he made the exact same, obviously wrong, point.

The right-wing media in the US has successfuly inoculated their followers from factual evidence. To them, in-group cohesion is paramount, so even when presented with inarguable evidence, they will simply ignore it- in many cases, they won't even argue with it! Instead they just go back to reciting talking points like they are Marco Rubio behind a debate podium. 

You cannot have a constructive conversation when one side is trying to better their understanding of the world, and the other is evangelizing a worldview that isn't meaningfully connected to observable facts in any significant way."

I am quite happy to point out all the garbage in their platform, but platforms are just words. Actions mean significantly more to me, personally.

Nevertheless, I downloaded the 2020 platform and took another look, here are some highlights:

- Abolishing the CFPB, which has returned multiple billions of unjust fees to consumers since it's inception. Page 3.

- Removing the regulations that require banks to meet certain thresholds for lending in terms of demographics. These standards exiat because, when left to themselves, banks *still* wildly discriminate- as recently as the 2010s, fines measuring in the hundreds of millions were paid for illegal redlining practices. The GOP knows that without these regulations, banks will continue denying black and latino citizens access to housing on the same terms as whites, because they were doing that before the regulations, and are still doing so, even now, albeit more rarely. Page 4.

- Immediately after this, the GOP reaffirms their desire to keep zoning controls as local as possible. It is broadly accepted that zoning practices are a primary cause of housing unaffordability, and the GOP wants to ensure that neighborhoods can keep the dirty poors away. Page 4.

- Horrifyingly, they want to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act, something I am aware of personally through my job, that guarantees certain levels of pay for skilled tradespeople working federal projects, as well as blocking undocumented workers from said projects. ***To be perfectly clear, the GOP wants to rescind laws that ensure American steelworkers, electricians, and pipefitters are paid well for working on critical government projects, and replace well-paid citizens with undocumented immigrants being paid a fraction of the pay***. I literally cannot emphasize enough how key the DB Act is to ensuring our tradespeople are paid well. Companies around the nation base rates on this system, and most unions do as well. If the DB Act goes away, the skilled, highly paid workers at government facilities would vanish and be replaced by a crowd that looks like a Tyson farm crew, making $8/hr. Repealing this would be a massive blow to what remains of our skilled trades. Page 5.

---Frankly at this point I kinda started hopping around because the whole thing is written in politician-speak and I get a little sick reading it.

- Hilariously they have gold-bug shit in here too, because of course. Page 7.

- Repealing the federal minimum wage and gutting the FLSA is the subject of Page 8. Minimum wage is it's own discussion, but they also want to strip *all* worker protections from unfair dismissal and go to a right-to-work model for every state. I don't need to explain what that would mean.

- They expressly state in their platform as a goal, to remove the right to same-sex marriage, as well as rescind legal protections for LGBT people. Page 11.

- They support ""a balanced approach"" for encryption and data privacy, one that ""respects legitimate need for government access to encrypted information"". This is code for removing a citizen's right to encrypt and retain their own private information and would be a massive expansion of government power, both soft and hard. Page 13.

Full disclosure, I stopped here because there is no point going farther. Their agenda is immensely destructive to me directly and personally, as well as to most of the ones I know and love. I don't think the point needs to be belabored any further."
5427,2020-11-09 19:33:32,jqqw71,">Do you think that all Republicans are obstructionists? Are they all racists? Are they all fascists?

Of course not, and it's a little odd that you would read that into my statement- the reasons someone may vote Republican are as diverse as the voters themselves. 

However, it doesn't matter if they are bigoted or not, when the politicians they vote for are pushing policies that treat others maliciously, and that is the problem. 

>You're making the same mistakes that the Republicans did. It's called ""splitting"". 

Not at all, as I said I respect there are many reasons why people vote Republican, and that's why they have the influence they do- their ideas are easier to market and push than more left-leaning ones, which is why people support them, in addition to self-interest, family tradition, social pressure, or simple intellectual agreement with the Republican end-goals and worldview.

---

Here is the difference between how I address them and how they address me.

I have voted for Republicans in the past, if they were trustworthy and qualified (it has only happened twice, but still). An increasing number of Republicans indicate they would never vote for a Democratic candidate, regardless of their platform. This is an indication that many GOP voters are not making their decisions based on policies, but purely on alignment with a particular social group. 

Furthermore, I respect the rights and dignity of all people, even the ones who hate me. I want everyone to turn out to vote, hell, I want voting to be *compulsory* so nobody can dispute that our government is, in fact, representative of the people's wishes. Republicans actively work to suppress voting throughout the country, and especially where they think they may lose if turnout goes up.

Last and most importantly, I *do not have hate* for them. I have spent literal years of my life, many thousands of hours, studying history, economics, political theory, and sociology, so that I can understand not just *what* people think, but *why* they think that way. I have most likely learned and forgotten more about the history of conservatism than most GOP voters ever knew about it in the first place. 

But, despite all the effort *I* have gone through to understand and communicate with them, I have never received the same level of respect, either from them as individuals, or from their institution towards myself as a member of several categories they do not favor. No matter how much empathizing I do, no matter how respectful I am, in the eyes of the GOP as an institution, I am a moral degenerate and do not deserve civil rights or protections. They want my employer to not have to provide reasonable accomodations for me, despite my productivity, and further want to deny me the right to marry who I wish. They want my employer to have the ability to terminate me for expressly discriminatory reasons.

---

So, where does this leave us then? When I say the GOP wants to make the country an awful place and must be opposed vigorously, I don't mean taking a poleaxe to the front door of the 82-year-old down the street who has an NRA flag on his porch. I mean showing up to vote in numbers, and pressing our candidates to fight for our protection and defend the vulnerable against political forces that want to do harm to me, my friends, my family, and millions of American citizens who just want to live their lives.

In the end, I understand better than most why Republican *voters* make the choice they do, and I don't personally hate them for it. But their politicians have an agenda that is actively poisonous, and the fact that their voters simply do not care who gets hurt by the ones *they* vote for, means that Republican voters, as a block, are also a threat to the wellbeing of many in this nation, and their voting initiatives need to be opposed by our own presence there to take the majority position back, and keep shitty political opinions from turning into dead diabetics. Or deported DACA recipients. Or war veterans that die outside the walls of the nation they risked everything to serve. And on and on and on, the list of who Republicans want to hurt and blame for everything never ends. 

This ended up being much longer than I intended, and I apologize for that. I do hope you read it, though. This means a lot to me, and I can tell you are a good person and this is important to you, as well.

Maybe someday all of us can look past our differences, but right now, some of us just can't, and morally bankrupt political operators are using that discomfort with diversity for their own perverse benefit."

That always bugs me, being an urbanized redneck myself, but let's not pretend that Reddit comments are representative of mainstream discourse (thank the gods). 

Similarly, let's also be honest here- candidates have been putting out plans for dislocated workers ever since the question first arose. Clinton had a very specific and helpful plan for West Virginia's economic development that received virtually no press coverage, for example.

Biden has a substantial portion of his climate plan dedicated to the employment opportunities that it would bring.  The single biggest opportunity is likely within infrastructure, however, it is also worth noting that no climate plan under serious consideration involves vaporizing the oil industry overnight. Rather, ending the massive subsidies we currently pay to support the oil will help to fix the current distorted market, and economic pressures will realign the industry without massive government intervention needed- we are already near a tipping point wherein renewables are cheaper than fossil fuels, and once fossil fuel companies have to bring the negative externality of carbon release onto their balance sheets (an initiative supported by nearly every economics authority regardless of ideology) that shift to renewables will accelerate- no sweeping bans of anything needed.

The transition away from fossil fuels is already underway, but will take at least 30-50 years total, far more than enough time to create specific retraining solutions. We have even done this before- a coworker of mine finished his degree using a program for dislocated oil workers in decades past. This is not a new, or even hard question.

> And yes, there are racial disparities in our country - but do Democrats really think that basing everything around peoples' races will fix anything? 

I really don't understand what you mean here. Intentionally trying to include the voices of historically and presently marginalized groups isn't ""making everything about race"" unless you believe the *default* race is ""white"", and everything else is ""political"".

> Police officers need better training, but that costs MORE money, not less.

Police reform is way more complicated than that, which is why I *hate* the slogan ""defund the police"", because the substance of that movement isn't even to defund them. Rather, cops today fill a variety of functions that they are not really the right tools for (and that other nations do not use them for). This is an entirely separate tangent, however, so I will resist the urge to wax verbose about it.

> But, the most concerning thing is the anti-Democracy sentiment that has been perpetuated here, on Facebook, on Twitter... if Trump would have won, what do you honestly think the reaction would have been from the Left? Trump was a bully, but Democrats seem to be completely blind to the way that they bully Republicans.

I take *extreme* issue with the last sentence. Republicans have absolutely no right to complain, *none*. Not when their platform explicitly opposes my human rights and advocates the persecution of anyone who isn't already rich. Internet people being mean to conservatives on the internet is *not* equal to what the GOP has done, and continues to do. How many times have GOP officials compared LGBT people to pedophiles or people who have sex with animals? How many times have they called their political rivals communists, anti-american, and burned figures in effigy? Or how about the horrendously racist way Obama was portrayed throughout his Presidency by right-wing pundits? 

>And here's a big one (for me at least): if Trump was so bad, why are Democrats intent on giving MORE money and power to the Federal government? If Trump and the Republicans had the money and power that Democrats want to give, how much worse do you think his Presidency could have been? 

For one, it's a misnomer that Republicans want to ""shrink the government"". The GOP wants to ban personal encryption, remove what few checks on police behavior still exist, drastically curtail the freedom of and protections for workers, directly involve the federal government in questions of private business through regulations that protect entrenched monopolies, and expand the military even more than it already is.

Democrats are not exactly minarchists, but the vast majority of their policy concerns are domestic in nature, focusing on issues that affect citizens like wages and unemployment, social safety nets, education, etc. The GOP focuses on massive corporations and the interests of the elite, as shown by the fact that they have never passed a single bill that directly benefits the average citizen, with a neutral or negative impact on the wealthy or corporations. Their legislative history shows that they will never place the lives of average people above the interests of the wealthiest and most powerful, plain and simple.

That being said: what exactly is your proposal here? The reason the executive is more powerful today than 20 years ago is mostly because of Republicans under Newt Gingrich and later Mitch McConnell obstructing the entire government for 10+ years, forcing executive action. If you want the federal government to be less jntrusive, we need politicians who actually want to pass laws first.

Question- what powers are the Democrats wanting to give the government, that Republicans don't also have similar goals for, or that the government does not already have?"

T’as pris en compte la possibilité que Biden est juste un gros nul ? Vieux mec blanc bizarre qui oublie le nom de son adversaire, dit au blacks que s’ils votent Trump, ils ne sont pas black (wtf??), et raconte des histoires bizarre sur Corn Pop et ses jambes poilues.

En plus, on lit littéralement tous les jours dans les grands journaux américains que Trump c’est la fin du monde, c’est un gros incompétent, corrompu, chien de la Russie, etc. Et quatre ans plus tard, j’ai pas trop l’impression que ça va si mal que ça. Tout comme après 8 ans d’Obama, ça n’a pas trop changé non plus.

5628,2020-12-15 16:05:36,kdo6s3,Sell ertz carson Mike williams fuller Taysom hill jalen hurts for picks
5629,2020-12-15 16:16:10,kdo6s3,"You've got some solid pieces here. I think the dice just didn't roll your way this season. 

At QB you could use a stud, but your depth is promising. I want to see how Hurts looks ROS before I make a decision. I'm not a Taysom guy, so I would sell him for whatever I can get.

Your RB depth is worrisome. Only CEH has a great long term outlook. I would look to add cheap youth here. 

WR is solid with Terry and Kenny. I'm not huge on Diontae so I would sell if I can get a 1st. Same with Kirk, Mike Will, and Fuller. 

Overall this isn't a terrible team. Assuming CEH takes over a 75%+ workload next year and some of your younger WRs take a step up, you should be an alright team. I would just look for RB youth with your picks."
5630,2020-12-15 16:40:59,kdo6s3,"All anyone says on here is trade so-and-so for picks. True, but if you’re trying to dig out of last place asap you need to acquire proven talent more than unproven. Whether that’s with picks or some of your young potential, I think you should consider packaging assets for an elite player at a each position. Easier said than done."
5631,2020-12-15 15:58:08,kdnfnx,"Just goes to show how much of a crap-shoot the draft is. Also, context is important when looking back at these..

In 2016, A’Shawn Robinson was a popular mock draft pick to the Lions in the 1st round, so many people were happy to see him fall to them in the 2nd.  Obviously we would have loved to get a Michael Thomas level player on the team, but at the time, ARob seemed like a steal. 

Also, 2016 was the year that Marvin Jones Jr signed with Detroit to replace newly-retired Calvin Johnson to pair with Golden Tate. Not sure that MT would have been viewed as a necessary addition, given the large contracts already devoted to the WR room."
5632,2020-12-15 16:45:46,kdnfnx,Still pissed we cut huntley our 5th round pick. What a waste
5633,2020-12-15 16:19:00,kdnfnx,"This is good data but requires some additional analysis. I'd like to compare it to similar data of winning and losing GMs. Also some grading on players other than binary Pro Bowl/ not Pro bowl.

Similar to other lists mark each player as:

Out of league or practice squad

On roster

Starter

Pro bowler+


Maybe it's just me but I don't know every player every drafted and their current situation. So outside of big names it's hard to get information on a lot of these picks.


The only thing I can get from this data is the draft is a crapshoot which we already know. Like I said good data but might have to go a few steps further to actually use this to grade him. Remember every player we ""passed"" on so did all the teams that selected ahead of us. 


I'm bored at work I might steal your table and get to work on additional data collection."
5634,2020-12-15 16:24:03,kdnfnx,"Jamal Agnew was 1st team all-pro as a rookie, might want to add that to the chart"
5635,2020-12-15 15:22:57,kdnfnx,A big question I’ll have going forward will be who the better pick was between Swift and Taylor. Right now it’s looking like Swift will be the better back but I could easily see Jonathan Taylor picking up steam if Indi can figure out how their running game
5636,2020-12-15 19:16:54,kdnfnx,"Bob Quinn’s drafting was pretty bad, but what really made his performance unacceptable were his free agency signings. He missed on almost all of the big money signings"
5637,2020-12-15 17:30:06,kdnfnx,"I would actually be curious to see how bad our luck has been for taken right before us... just the first round the last two years, we missed on Josh Allen to Jacksonville and Chase Young to Washington"
5638,2020-12-15 15:44:20,kdnfnx,Bob quinn was way too inconsistent. He would either make a good pick or a bad. No in between
5639,2020-12-15 18:07:39,kdnfnx,TL;DR: He was bad at drafting
5640,2020-12-15 20:55:14,kdnfnx,"I'd love to see something like this, but instead of ""next pick"" or ""next pick at same position"" I would just see who would have been picked if you had gone ""BPA"" based on pre-draft rankings."
5641,2020-12-15 22:31:35,kdnfnx,"There are a couple stand out bad picks (tabor and tavai) but most of he’s drafting was decent.  Do the same analysis for every team, there’s always some misses.  Tavai and tabor were inexcusable “smartest man in the room” millenesq moves, but there were some good picks as well in there.

My biggest knock on Quinn was the the roster moves, the talent lost in sacrifice for “system” guys."
5642,2020-12-16 02:07:49,kdnfnx,Listen I don't want to be that guy but the next CB taken off the board after okudah in 2020 was Henderson
5643,2020-12-16 02:10:18,kdnfnx,In conclusion Quinn either drafted a blocker a catcher or a bust
5644,2020-12-16 01:25:11,kdnfnx,"Also the Decker pick. Keanu Neal was the next pick and did make a probowl. However, since then he has not been able to stay healthy at all and Decker has quietly become one of the better LTs around. Context is everything here."
5645,2020-12-16 06:24:30,kdnfnx,"I remember a lot of people were excited about Teez Tabor in round 2 as well myself included. Guy was rated a top corner throughout most of the draft process, his 40 killed his stock and unfortunately his career."
5646,2020-12-15 19:53:46,kdnfnx,"BQ heard, “speed kills” and didn’t want Huntley harming anybody on the team."
5647,2020-12-16 04:04:52,kdnfnx,"Quinn had a way of cutting 5th/6th round picks before the season even started. I get avoiding the sunk cost fallacy, but it happened more often than it should have."
5648,2020-12-15 16:45:50,kdnfnx,"100% agree, please steal the table and do a deeper analysis, I didn't have to time to!"
5649,2020-12-15 15:39:40,kdnfnx,"Running backs are usually so offensive-line dependent, though, that it's hard to really know for sure."
5650,2020-12-15 15:57:17,kdnfnx,"Frankly I don't think the distinction between these two is all that important. Both seem to be starters, maybe even pro-bowlers, but RB is frankly not an impact position unless the back is either a transcendental talent or really really bad at following blocks.  


OL and scheme are far more impactful in the running game."
5651,2020-12-15 18:56:06,kdnfnx,Josh Allen had me big sad. I didn't think Jacksonville was going to pick him. I figured they would draft more help on the oline.
5652,2020-12-15 16:48:18,kdnfnx,"I mean i think there were quite a few OK picks:

A'Shawn Robinson, Miles Killebrew, Dwayne Washington, Reeves-Maybin, Austin Bryant, Ty Johnson, all see OK to me.

My bigger issue is 2 Pro Bowlers in 4 drafts, 1 of which was a kick returner."
5653,2020-12-15 22:33:45,kdnfnx,"I don’t think bad is a fair assessment, average is more accurate.  Look at everyone else’s draft, there’s hits and misses.  Crucify Quinn for the players he got rid of to fit Matty Patties “system”"
5654,2020-12-15 23:26:45,kdnfnx,"Feel free to use this table as a starting point! I dont think I can put more time into it right now, I'd love to see that as well"
5655,2020-12-16 02:55:39,kdnfnx,Whoops typo sorry about that.
5656,2020-12-16 01:26:11,kdnfnx,Yeah that one made no sense.
5657,2020-12-15 16:52:18,kdnfnx,Pro bowlers dont really mean much. Hes drafted some really good players but they wont be pro bowlers becuase they play for the lions

My OB does Misoprostol for inductions and I went in Thursday night. My son was  born Sunday morning. It’s was a brutally long wait and nothing even really happened until Saturday night when they broke my water and started pitocin. My advice if your body isn’t ready is to be prepared for a long visit 🤣. I definitely was not prepared mentally to be there for 2 days before even really being in labor. Good luck!!

Ps - they induce you early when you’re medically controlled with insulin because the placenta can break down quickly due to meds. It’s safer for all that way."
5700,2020-12-15 02:44:02,kdcud5,"Thank you for the advice! I really don’t know much on the medical side and if it’s best for him, then it’s what going to happen"
5701,2020-12-15 09:14:54,kdcud5,"If your main concern for induction is not wanting a Xmas baby, I would go for the induction and hope that it’s quick. You say you’ve got your fasting numbers reasonable under control, that doesn’t sound as though they are in target every day. I could understand if you wanted to wait another week but that still doesn’t fit in with you. 

What about asking for a sweep. I had two at 37 and 38 weeks for my 39 week induction. The first one I was closed up but the second one seemed to do a bit more and I lost my pug the next day. Went in 2cm dilated and midwife said she could break my water straight away.  I ended up having an emergency section and the worst thing about it is my mother constantly telling me if I had waited I would have given birth naturally not quite getting the increased risk of waiting was not worth it."
5702,2020-12-15 02:42:23,kdcud5,"I’m diet controlled and scheduled for an induction. From my understanding the induction is what’s best for baby. Since gestational diabetes can cause placenta deterioration. 

So while you could wait to see what happens it might not be what’s best for the baby. I’d rather get induced early and spend four days in the hospital than risking any problems to my baby. 

Also having a holiday birthday is what you make of it. Your baby won’t care that it’s the week of Christmas if you always make sure to celebrate it separately."
5703,2020-12-15 04:14:00,kdcud5,"For what it’s worth, I was “maybe 1cm dilated” at 37+6. My doctor told me not to get excited and joked that she was practically 1cm dilated too and told me to plan a long induction.

I went into labor 12 hours later.

I did have a somewhat scary birth experience with my gd baby & they autopsied my placenta and said it had started to calcify. She’s totally fine now and they definitely didn’t blame the GD for sure, they said they didn’t really know what caused it. Baby is totally fine now.

I guess for me I would induce with a better “safe than sorry” approach.that approach isn’t for everyone. But your reasons against seek to have more to do with avoiding a date close to Christmas which is pretty much happening anyway. You’ll have to remind people your child gets a birthday celebration and a Christmas one, family will be traveling near the time of the birthday etc no matter what, whether he arrives dec 24 or dec 26 or dec 28. So I wouldn’t let that part decide your course of action!"
5704,2020-12-15 09:18:57,kdcud5,"I’m reading your post and am thinking “is this me writing this?”.... had OB appt today, 37+4. Controlled GD...baby looking great , just about 7lbs , fluid a little high but not above average threshold yet. OB recommended induction this Monday as well, I’m .5 CM dilated , baby’s head is super low and where it should be ... we’re right on track. I struggled with deciding whether I want to do this ... but I am so with you. Physically , I am done. Checked out ... and I’m more afraid of developing complications if I wait and risking more invasive intervention (c-section, episiotomy, etc...). After thinking about it , I was just like “let’s do this”... I’m feeling it’s the right thing to do. Whatever you decide will be the right thing to do also. All the best!"
5705,2020-12-15 13:45:08,kdcud5,"I’m confused, are you a first timer or did you have a previous vaginal birth? If you have a prior vaginal birth your induction will likely be successful at 39wks. 

Also like, if you for sure want to avoid a Christmas birthday, schedule a CS for 39 on the dot! Avoid a 4 day induction and get baby out before the placenta craps out. I think it’s a totally reasonable request to avoid an unfavorable induction that is more likely to end in a CS anyhow. 

I am all about reducing risks to baby during birth. This is also my second and final baby so the effects of cumulative CS concern me less. If you’re going for like 5 kids, you need to avoid CS as much as possible. But if you’re doing 1 or 2? Fuck nature, get that baby out as safely as possible."
5706,2020-12-16 17:52:50,kdcud5,I’m getting induced 12/22 and have the same stress about a Christmas baby. My husband and I both have winter birthdays and hate it. We are already planning to celebrate his half birthday in the summer. (We will still do cake a one gift on actual birthday but the whole shebang on half birthday)
5707,2020-12-15 02:46:06,kdcud5,"I was right where you are with baby weight week 38 my second baby who was an induction. He ended up 7.12. My first baby was spontaneous vaginal starting at 40+5 ending at 41 and needed the vacuum which was the last attempt of almost three hours pushing before c-section which I did not want. He was 8.3. So, it really depends on your build and a lot of other factors. But, I’d definitely support birthing a smaller baby with less complications and interventions. That being said, women can deliver 10lb babies no problem vaginally without complications. I really hope your cervix makes some moves for you! I also had an awesome induction experience but it was my second baby so I won’t offer up more than that!"
5708,2020-12-15 18:32:45,kdcud5,"If the induction is after 39 weeks I’d take the induction. It avoids a birthday right on Christmas , it’s a great gestational week to be born (look up ARRIVE study). 

But ultimately it’s your choice!"
5709,2020-12-15 13:49:22,kdcud5,"I’m a first timer! Since my OB is so busy, I can’t really pick which day I get induced, the 21st was the only option :(. Honestly, if I was getting induced this Friday I think I was be less hesitant which is so superficial and dumb I know. I’m the worst!"
5710,2020-12-15 01:48:35,kdbzxs,A remake of Princess Bride?  INCONCEIVABLE!!!
5711,2020-12-15 01:52:35,kdbzxs,Remake it but only if you bring back Fred Savage who is now reading the book to his child. Reading it to a daughter instead might be an interesting switch up too.

5739,2020-12-14 21:40:33,kd66h3,Yet another redhead...honestly I get WB has to be diverse and stuff now but was having the rock and race bending hawkman(something I’m not overly bothered by honestly) really not enough?
5740,2020-12-14 22:08:52,kd66h3,We cant have a red headed binary for once?
5741,2020-12-14 22:17:52,kd66h3,It's funny because they clearly know the character is meant to look like the image on the right. Yet they don't care. Been a fan of DJ for a minute but this movie just looks like it's continuing the tradition of reinventing characters. How original.
5742,2020-12-14 20:59:53,kd66h3,"We've got our Atom Smasher, Hawkman, and Cyclone. Just waiting on that Doctor Fate. I'm holding out hope for another B-list actor to offset The Rock."
5743,2020-12-15 04:32:49,kd66h3,"I have a slightly related question. If I date someone who identifies non-binary but has female physical qualities and female genitalia like Quintessa am I still ""straight""? I'm genuinely curious"
5744,2020-12-15 13:14:12,kd66h3,"1. Unless the race of a character is important for that specific character, it's irrelevant. Some characters that should always be of a certain ethnic, for the purpose of the character and his/her history to make sense are Bruce Wayne, Jefferson Pierce, John Stewart, etc. If it doesn't matter for the story of the character, why do you care??

2. People barely even knew Cyclone. Why are you so angry?  Casting is only bad after you get to see the movie. Remember how did people react with the news of Ledger as Joker???

3. People here are actually getting downvoted for pointing put the actor uses they as pronoun. They're non-binary. I think just that's is what bothers a lot of you, and you hide behind the excuse of hair or skin colour.

I know I'll get downvoted, but look at yourself guys. This is not about your ""beloved"" character' ethnic changing. You know that. Take a deep breath and just wait for the fucking movie."
5745,2020-12-14 23:08:01,kd66h3,"Another redhead white character swapped out for a black actor. What is with the war on redheads? Now let's take a black character and swap them out for a white actor, heads will explode."

5747,2020-12-14 22:05:51,kd66h3,This is bullshit. There arent just black people in the world. If your gonna race bend consider other races.
5748,2020-12-14 22:17:53,kd66h3,"Looks nothing like the character 🤦🏻‍♂️ 
Why do they keep casting black actors for roles that shouldn’t be played by them? Why is it so hard to get a redhead character played by a redhead actor?"
5749,2020-12-15 11:32:41,kd66h3,People are really pretending they care about Cyclone now lmao.
5750,2020-12-14 22:01:20,kd66h3,"Let’s be honest if it wasn’t for the Rock kickstarting Black Adam bringing forth a slew of B and C rated DC characters. They wouldn’t see the light of day. With that being said. The characters, setting and period they are aiming for are darker skinned characters depiction similar to Egyptian, Middle Eastern or African decent. It’s the mood of the film. Normally I would be right there complaining about comic accuracy but I am perfectly fine with this depiction. Aquaman was a perfect example from blonde hair and blue eyes to Polynesian. Let’s see where it goes before everyone starts firing off their angry rants about color accuracy"

5754,2020-12-14 21:55:18,kd66h3,They can still dye  the hair in red for the character. Hope they get rid of the nose earring. Doesn't fit the character at all.

However, I find it funny that suddenly people give a shit about Cyclone. I have never heard anyone mention her until this movie so why are people so butthurt about it? I think at the end of the day its more important that they fit the character. Besides, they can still dye this person's hair anyway."
5761,2020-12-14 21:18:58,kd66h3,It's really cool that a non-binary/gender non-conforming actor will now be part of a massive franchise like this.

The idea that it dosent matter is bs. People were up in arms about sonic not looking like sonic and Peter not looking like Peter in the spiderman game. WB Themselves spent millions trying to remove superman's mustache and actors spend months trying to prepare their bodys to look more like the jacked superhero from the comics."

I have two actors up for a role. One of the actors is clearly better at delivering lines & fits what the director wants. HOWEVER, the other actor looks EXACTLY like the character, but the lines aren’t coming off as well....

What would you do? Or for the sake of comic accuracy are you choosing the actor that just LOOKS the part?"

5846,2020-12-18 01:22:47,kd66h3,"No because proportionally white people are overrepresented.

Red haired people are massively over represented in the comics because red hair was visually distinctive, which helped differentiate when most charcaters were barely distinguishable outside of hair colour. 

Because of this, when white charcaters are race swapped its going to look like red haired people are being targeted when they're not really."

This feels too familiar to the Starfire situation on *Titans*. And I'm just gonna skip this film. It just feels too much pandering. I was alright with Hawkman's casting, but this feels too much. Better wait for Black Adam to appear in *Shazam! 3*"
5850,2020-12-14 23:35:38,kd66h3,"I am all for more BAME representation (as an Asian, we we have almost zero representation in the comic book films, and the first Asian lead is ""good at martial arts""). Anna Diop is easily the best part of Titans (though I wish they at least gave her skin a slight golden hue/shimmer/sheen), and Momoa as Arthur Curry couldn't really have been a more perfectly casted part, but redheads are either race-swapped or represented as sexually promiscuous/awakened/free.

Like in the Supergirl TV show, Jimmy Olsen was turned into somebody most definitely not Jimmy Olsen, which, sure, artistic license, but Winn Schott is *right there* and pretty much is Olsen in all but name. Just make Jordan play Olsen and have Brooks play either Harper who can be whatever race, or even Mal Duncan, who himself is *already a black character*.

Or just do what Batwoman did and create an entirely new character which Supergirl already did anyway just to name him Winn Schott and not Jimmy Olsen.

Like, damn, the representation is already *right there*."

At least they could have tried but they did not want to. If the other characters were closer to the comic character less people would mind this Cyclone girl but that is not the case. And I live in Europe so somebody tell me: what’s the americans problem with redhead comic book characters? I have a feeling that Hollywood wants to erase them.
5855,2020-12-15 01:08:16,kd66h3,"Out of those two? To be completely honest? I'm gonna go with the one that more closely resembles the character from the comics.

Even if their delivery and skills are slightly less than the other actor's, acting skills can always be inporved upon and coached. Alden Ehrenreich received coaching for his role as Solo and he actually turned out quite well."

They were the last  dynasty of ancient Egypt. Alexander the Great was the first European pharaoh of Egypt.

All Batmen are completely different from one another physically. And none of them look exactly as a traditional comic book Bruce Wayne. And nobody really cared that much.
People barely even know the Cyclone character. They reacted like this simply because the actor is not a redhead / is black. Maybe, just maybe, they were simply the best choice for the role and that's it. Let's wait until we see the movie.. if they do it wrong, then we'll know casting fucked up."

It doesn't detract from their character.

Comic accuracy is great, but it shouldn't be the end all be all, these are primarily elseworlds, intended for different, more diverse audiences. 

Comicbook fans are so willing to embrace a multiverse but the adaptations set in different universes must be the same as the comics, no room for new versions of old charcaters, no room for experimentation."

Do you really think that race swapping is only ever to a black person? You're seriously going to look at the DECU with a Polynesian Aquaman and an Israeli Wonder Woman and say that? 

Obviously there is a greater push for black people than there are other races right now, and other races absolutely deserve more representation, but the reason there is a greater push is because it's trying to coutneract the systemic issues they face moreso than other PoC and minority ethnic groups in the USA do.

Changing, say, Cyborg to a white person isn't an inherently bad idea (I think race swapping is only bad when the race/ethnicity is important to the character, ie, Black Panther), but it would mean less black representation when there is already so little, and while changing Hawkman to a black man does take away representation from white people, when 90% of the charcaters are already white, it's not anywhere near as big an issue. 

But if you're talking about, say, Jason Momoa's Aquaman meeting a different Aquaman thats got white skin and blonde hair, I'd have absolutely no issue with that.

The policy isn't that they should *only* hire black people or that race swaps should *only* be to black actors, your understanding of this is childish at best, deliberately obtuse at worst.

The policy does not prevent non-black PoC from getting roles, it's used to help account for hiring biases that more heavily discriminate against black people.

Is it even confirmed he's playing Carter? 

There is precedent for Hawkman having black incarnations, and there is precedent that he exists across space, time and the Multiverse, so while there isn't specific precedent for Carter Hall being black, is it impossible for a version of carter to exist where he's black? 

>I expect them to adapt things accurately or else why are they even bothering to adapt it in the first place.

Adaptation involves change, like, by definition. If you really cared about everything being accurate you wouldn't like *any* casting as there is always something different. How do you draw the line? What threshold is there?

>The character has far more precedent to being white than he does being black.

5966,2020-12-14 16:16:18,kcztrf,"The analogy to race ends up obscuring far more than it illuminates. There's no one rule about how race works; it's entirely dependent upon racial group and societal context. Did the conquistadors who rebelled against the Spanish, joined the Mayans, and ended their days as Mayan war chieftains become Mayan when they chose their side, when they were accepted by Mayan communities, or when they adopted Mayan language and dress? It's vanishingly unlikely that they ever changed their physical characteristics to be more ethnically Mayan, and the Spanish never recognized them as anything but renegade Spaniards, but the Mayans they joined certainly did. 

Anyway, gender is a totally different beast. Presentation can't determine gender because gender determines what presentation even means. A cis drag queen doesn't temporarily become and unbecome a trans woman, and certainly doesn't have the same need to change his body that she will tend to have, because for the most part men tend to be most comfortable in male bodies they're compatible with, and women typically aren't, whether they're cis or trans. (Which is why you don't see a lot of cis women transitioning to male.) Whatever gives rise to gender identity is a lot more fundamental than presentation."

You got Hanukkah, Kwanza, Christmas, and a lot more. All of them are social constructs, but each one is different from the others. However, there is no one right way to celebrate. Every culture has unique traditions just for them. And every family has their own traditions too. This unique individuality is like gender expression. Same holiday, but unique to that individual and their personal preference for how they celebrate."
5969,2020-12-14 16:52:09,kcztrf,"This is a lot so bear with me.

> 63% female and 37% male

This is not what people are saying when we say gender is a spectrum. I don't know anyone who puts percentages to their expression, but I also don't know anyone in real life that falls into perfectly defined feminine or masculine boxes. Using your own example, imagine the Rock, embodying all things masculine. Now Elton John, embodying a whole lot of feminine. Every other man in the world probably lands somewhere between these two in masculine expression, and yet every one of them is still a man. The same can be said of women, falling somewhere on a spectrum between hyper feminine and masculine. If gender *must* be binary, is the entire range of masculinity in one box and the entire range of femininity in another box and the two never overlap? Or does it make more sense that its just one spectrum, with some people landing on the masculine side, some people on the feminine side, and some people landing smack in the middle? Nonbinary identities and gender fluid people don't land cleanly on this spectrum, but thats an entire different conversation. 

> consider race

Don't. Thats a false comparison. Gender is defined solely by a person, not their ancestry or location of birth. No amount of identifying can change who your parents were or where you were born. 

> if gender is about identity ... doesn't that make gender meaningless?

Of course not. If the Rock comes out as trans and identifies as a woman then she's a woman. There are entire organizations for body building women, saying that a woman who is stacked and masculine isn't a real woman is pretty sexist. Just like saying a man who performs in musicals and wears high fashion isn't really a man is pretty sexist. Gender roles and expectations don't define gender, and going against those norms doesn't negate the idea of gender entirely. Expression is a way to express gender; its not a litmus test for how valid a person is, whether they're trans or cis. 

> 'man' and 'woman' are arbitrary labels that have no deeper implications

Societal norms of gender expression aren't deep implications. There *is* a deep meaning to man or woman (for most people, that is), and it appears that it varies from person to person. Which is why you have men like the Rock and men like Billy Porter, both of whom are absolutely men, despite expressing their masculinity in drastically different ways. Hell, ask any 5 men you know to define masculinity or what it means to be a man, and you will get 5 different answers. Just because its not consistent between people doesn't mean its shallow and meaningless. It means its a highly personal thing, that the only ""right"" answer is that one that makes sense to you. At least, thats how it works for cis people; Billy Porter is a highly visible cis man who isn't questioned for wearing dresses and makeup and being a performing artist. A trans man would struggle incredibly hard to be taken seriously as a man if he wore a dress.

>why do trans people even care about being misgendered

Because gender isn't meaningless, and has a deep meaning to the vast majority of people. This is not unique to trans people. If someone insisted on using the wrong pronouns for you, and used the masculine/feminine version of your name, and insisted that you were something that you are not, you would feel disrespected, right? Like someone is insisting, against all evidence, that because you don't meet some arbitrary threshold of masculinity or femininity that you aren't who you say you are? We feel the same. 

>your gender just describes now feminine or masculine you present yourself to the world

I hope the above helps clear up why I don't think this is a good conclusion, but just to wrap it up: a man who paints his nails is still a man. A woman who wears jeans and t-shirts is still a woman. There is no hard, clear cut definition of what it means to be masculine. To some men it means self sufficiency or strength of character. To other men it means being a caretaker and provider. To still more it means confidence and bucking the norms. None of these are presentation based. So if you disregard all those explanations and strictly base it on external expression, you have to draw some lines. What factors are those lines based on? Clothes, hobbies, speech patterns, voice pitch, hair length, self care routines, jobs, beard length, what? How could one possibly delineate the difference between men and women solely on external presentation?"

6000,2020-12-14 00:33:04,kclzny,wow
6001,2020-12-14 00:34:10,kclzny,Let's see if he gets this
6002,2020-12-14 02:41:31,kclzny,holy shit!
6003,2020-12-14 06:31:27,kclzny,I wonder if a Cricut machine could cut that pretty easily?
6004,2020-12-14 01:15:56,kclzny,Um... are we just gonna ignore the fact that there’s a bit of blue showing in the hole on the leaf and the drawing is on the white paper behind it? He didn’t carve it on a leaf...
6005,2020-12-13 23:59:53,kclzny,Next time will try😊
6006,2020-12-14 01:21:18,kclzny,He used a cricut machine. He probably made the design himself but he didn’t physically cut it. Still pretty awesome tho :D
6007,2020-12-14 01:38:55,kclzny,Mmm wouldn’t that support it being on the leaf?
6008,2020-12-14 02:22:25,kclzny,"The blue showing, and the carving sticking off the paper slightly, just supports the claim it was carved not drawn. A drawing on paper wouldn't stick off the page like this one does."
6009,2020-12-15 06:57:46,kclzny,It was drawn. You can even see a crease line up perfectly.
6010,2020-12-15 17:37:50,kclzny,"looking at the face, it would probably be better drawn than that (no offense to op, still awesome as hell) and that blue showing the image literally sticks out off the page is just more proof it isn't drawn. I'm not sure what you mean about the crease but I'm assuming you mean the veins in the leaf, but if they line up perfectly then they must be part of the leaf, no?"
6011,2020-12-13 22:28:08,kcjfzk,Excellent.

But generally speaking if December 7 was her delivery date and Wrestlemania is on the 28th if March, she may be able to return, whilst Seth is at home. I'm not too sure how maternity leaves really work, though or if she'll physically be able to return and if she did, she'll probably be a part timer.

Also I completely forgot about Sasha's streak whilst writing this 😬. But I felt like Bianca would need the win more than she would since she hasn't won a champion herself."

6215,2020-12-30 05:22:02,kmudam,That may not be a good idea. Cuz what if our souls are immortal? And then it just takes longer to get aware. It's a big oof. You'll get through it though. You seem pretty smart (especially with the humor) and more aware than the average individual.
6216,2020-12-30 06:37:09,kmudam,"it's both a blessing and a curse, being aware. while you can recognise a lot of your problems, your brain's a rampaging beast and we're ultimately just a small part of it. We can't just stop the brain in it's tracks and soothe it, try as we might, otherwise things like depression wouldn't exist. and then comes the self loathing because when you can see the problems clear enough to notice but are too blind to actually do anything substantial, you turn on yourself. you stop asking for help in fear of being selfish, you start dreaming of just shoving a handcannon into your mouth and turning your head into a meaty puree; you're aware of all your shortcomings but are just along for the ride, you know? hell, for all i know i could just be responding because this reply gave me a little dopamine squirt and i'm just chasing that high again, but let's not be cynical i suppose.

still, your words are appreciated. was in a bad place when i wrote that, thankfully not too far-gone to not be me, and it seems i made just enough of an impact to be seen. while i can't hope to repay you for your time, my advice isn't that great, at the least i can wish you fortune. so, have a great day and an even greater future."
6217,2020-12-29 20:56:27,kmldbt,"Wow, what a long post. I feel like you might get better engagement if you broke this into a couple parts, perhaps by region.     

Also I’m not quite sure what this means:
> Worldwide, the highest grossing movie of all time that never made it to number one is Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs (which made $886,686,817 at the box office). The highest grossing movie of all time that never made it to the top 5 (as well as the top 10) is Wolf Warrior 2 (which made $870,325,439 at the box office)  

I assume that in each territory, it’s the highest grossing movie that was never in that territory’s single weekend (\#1/Top 5/Top 10). But surely Wolf Warrior was in the worldwide weekend top 10 (and even top 5) on several occasions?"
6218,2020-12-29 19:56:47,kmldbt,What about Colombia? I think it would be pretty interesting since that’s where most of my family is from.
6219,2020-12-30 10:12:55,kmldbt,"> I assume that in each territory, it’s the highest grossing movie that was never in that territory’s single weekend (#1/Top 5/Top 10). But surely Wolf Warrior was in the worldwide weekend top 10 (and even top 5) on several occasions?

Correct; I only need to check [comScore's estimates as reposted on BOT](https://forums.boxofficetheory.com/topic/137-the-international-box-office-discussion-thread/page/165/#comments) to confirm that WW2 led the worldwide weekend box office outright for 3 weekends straight. Likewise, a combination of the existing domestic weekend charts on your favorite box office website and [old BOM's](https://web.archive.org/web/20150910160338/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/weekend/?yr=2009&wk=27&p=.htm) [international charts](https://web.archive.org/web/20150910161413/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/weekend/?yr=2009&wk=28&p=.htm) confirms that Ice Age 3 topped the worldwide box office over its first two weekends.

See, the problem with this post is that, as effortful as it was to gather all this data up and present it, the OP never bothered to do even the most basic of fact-checking of BOM's many, many international box office errors and missing country/IBO charts. For example, and since it was the first individual country they mentioned, it didn't take me much doing to find that [BatB had three consecutive Argentine weekend box office wins](https://www.exhibidorlatino.com/rankings.html) - albeit in terms of admissions, since I can't find a good source for the country's USD box office rankings. Another example: [The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug](http://www.kinometro.ru/box/show/week/51/region/ru/year/2013) and [The Man from U.N.C.L.E.](http://www.kinometro.ru/box/show/week/33/region/ru/year/2015) both opened at the top of the Russian box office, but the OP didn't see that on BOM because it's missing the relevant charts, so they parroted those data omissions as if they're the truth."

&#x200B;

Lockett is also close to setting a new record of receptions in a single season. He needs 7 more receptions to break the record of 94 receptions, currently co-held by Doug Baldwin and Bobby Engram. Metcalf also has an outside shot of breaking it, if he gets 15 receptions."
6230,2020-12-29 20:04:23,kmkvzg,"> Diggs: needs 4 TDs

6288,2020-12-28 18:49:31,klvt73,"He never matured in his time there. From reading about this on r/nfl it sounds like he’s literally handled this season as poorly as you could imagine. 

They weren’t likely to get anything in a trade anyway; the guy is sabotaging his own future in the league, probably without even realizing it."
6289,2020-12-28 21:07:11,klvt73,I think he has potential to be a good bridge qb but never the franchise guy

Brett Kollman is such a big fraud but with good editing software.  He don't know crap about football, he just frontin'.  It's a shame since his channel would  be just as entertaining w/o him faking that he knows football better than the average fan."
6292,2020-12-28 22:19:05,klvt73,Maybe the Ravens would be interested in another DC QB cast-off?

6295,2020-12-28 19:42:08,klvt73,"He's 23 and it isn't like his supporting cast is stellar - look at the team's record regardless of QB. It's a little early to write him off entirely.

These are the WFT top 2 QBs:

GP | CMP | ATT | CMP% | YDS | AVG | YDS/G | LNG | TD | INT | SACK | SYL | RTG

He's only caught 44% of his targets though, which even with the poor QB play seems extremely low for only 4 drops."

I'd have to imagine PFR hasn't updated yet. I'm sure it'll be in the 7-9 range soon. But yeah, they fluctuate a lot. I find PFF is usually more harsh with their drop stats, I remember that stat of Fitzgerald with 29 drops was floating around forever, but PFF had him at 42 drops just since 2006."

6328,2020-12-28 06:23:46,kljn7g,"IMO, I think a cool thing to do would be a young Jack, seeing his relationship with Beckett and getting branded as a pirate. Origin story type deal I guess. Or maybe a Davy Jones movie dealing with Calypso and the brethren court could be cool. 

I don’t have as strong opinions as you though lol, just some concepts I think could be interesting if there was a good story/team behind it."
6329,2021-01-11 22:57:13,kljn7g,I think without Jack Sparrow the franchise is dead in the water (pun intended) Gore Verbinski directing could be key. More involvement of will turner and elizabeth swann also....maybe like a return of davey jones based film (would explain the ending of pirates 5)....Take it back to the storyline and cast of pirates 3 and im all for it.
6330,2021-01-11 21:36:47,kljn7g,"Prequel is an option, as well as completely new world/story, but thinking about pirates and leaving out johnny is not an option. But I guess that it will be that way, unfortunately. And for new ""jack"" the level will be put pretty high. It would be hard to forget old jack and fall in love with the new one, as we did many years ago.
The one thing that I like about pirates 5 is Kaya Scodelario, along with the jack and his old crew who you got to admit got you laught out loud no matter how you dislike pirates 5. So, I would to se her again. Pirates always had that strong woman character and I think she did good job but also with some more work to do. Maybe expand story about her past or and future."
6331,2020-12-28 07:13:57,kljn7g,"I don’t think Johnny is going to be a part of this one, I could be wrong, but I think if anything at all, he’ll have a minor role.

I think Margot Robbie is going to be running the show this time around.

I do think her talent as an actor is actually underrated. I just hope they give her something great to work with for this film to bring some soul and vibrancy back to the franchise.

I just want to be entertained."
6332,2020-12-28 18:19:37,kljn7g,But the Margot Robbie project is separate from the sixth movie they are making (which hasn't confirmed Depp in it yet).

6347,2020-12-28 02:21:24,klgyxb,"Dude, look at Sanchez's statline in his brief time here, he's at the bottom or slightly above Haskins.

Grossman belongs in the top 5 of that list."
6348,2020-12-28 02:33:55,klgyxb,The sad part is that hes been regressing since the end of last season...
6349,2020-12-28 02:58:33,klgyxb,"I lived through Heath Shuler and it might be worse than that.  Shuler was at least in the 1990s where expectations were much lower.

Haskins is playing in the most QB friendly time that the league has ever had and he still can't do shit.

I would rather start Tony Banks, in a heartbeat, over Dwayne Haskins.  Give me Jeff George, at least I was entertained and hell he would throw some amazing passes.

Haskins is just awful.  Looks like he doesn't know how to play QB at all.  He looks lost, disinterested, beyond his depths."
6350,2020-12-28 02:51:20,klgyxb,John Beck?
6351,2020-12-28 15:18:50,klgyxb,To make Patrick Ramsey look competent is a skill in itself
6352,2020-12-28 02:30:36,klgyxb,Its kinda sad that Heinicke has played less than a half of football for us and i already have him above 4 other QBs😭😭but imo Kirk’s 2016 season was out of this world. 2012 RG3 and 2015/16 Kirk were both great i have Kirk ahead just barely
6353,2020-12-28 02:50:19,klgyxb,I am livid he was snubbed!
6354,2020-12-28 02:26:41,klgyxb,Rex was the fucking man. Butt fumble played what... one half of football here? Total disrespect
6355,2020-12-28 02:56:11,klgyxb,"OP doesn't have any idea what he's talking about.  Sanchez was about as bad as you could expect out of a QB for us.  Even worse maybe.

Grossman actually put together some good games for us.  Won some games.

Just leave him be.  He's probably 16 or something."
6356,2020-12-28 02:32:40,klgyxb,I was like 7 or 8 when Grossman played for us so i dont remember exactly but i remember my dad screaming at the tv at rex every game lmao
6357,2020-12-28 10:35:14,klgyxb,Don’t forget Shane matthews and Danny woooeeefull
6358,2020-12-28 03:29:13,klgyxb,I think I agree with this 100%.
6359,2020-12-28 03:39:28,klgyxb,"I think I'd move Trent Green up to ""Backups"" and Grossman down to ""Subpar"""
6360,2020-12-28 03:16:52,klgyxb,Cmon Case gotta be above Heinicke😭😭😭
6361,2020-12-28 02:20:19,klgyxb,Maybe now finally with this stellar defense the Kirk experience would’ve worked.
6362,2020-12-28 02:31:29,klgyxb,I think so too
6363,2020-12-28 02:26:27,klgyxb,"Cousins isn't the answer either, just look at the Vikings."
6364,2020-12-28 14:46:15,klgyxb,"No way this team should have given him the contract him and his agent were looking for. He had DJax, Garçon, Reed, Thompson, etc and couldn’t do any better overall than any other qb, except when it came to racking up garbage time stats.  

Literally no reason to have kept him except to make the L’s cost more for the franchise, but okay."
6365,2020-12-28 03:04:58,klgyxb,Yea I was like 2 when Johnson won our last playoff game. Brennan was released right before i started watching in 2010
6366,2020-12-28 02:25:09,klgyxb,I do believe Sanchez had that 90 yard handoff which was pretty sweet
6367,2020-12-28 02:33:28,klgyxb,Sanchez was such a meme during his Jets days that he exceeded my very low expectations that i had for him w us
6368,2020-12-28 05:09:08,klgyxb,Worse than beck
6369,2020-12-28 03:32:39,klgyxb,Played less then a half a quarter... not even a half of a game...
6370,2020-12-28 03:00:17,klgyxb,"Who could forget the legend of Tim Hasselbeck?

Whenever I think about how bad Haskins plays, I try to remember that once upon a time Tim Hasselbeck had a game worse than that.

It makes me feel better.  Not by much, but a little better."
6371,2020-12-28 03:01:20,klgyxb,Took the words right out of my mouth. Also a heat of the moment type of list.
6372,2020-12-28 02:35:06,klgyxb,There was one game were Rex got in a shoot out with Brady in his prime and almost won.
6373,2020-12-28 13:32:09,klgyxb,yeah.  I don't recall a ton of the Trent Green era.  I thought Grossman's numbers were better than they were.
6374,2020-12-28 03:23:58,klgyxb,"That is not how this list works as it is categories.  Heinicke looks great but in all honesty, it was one or two series and he will be a back up for the rest of his career if he is lucky.   I am not denying, he looked good but undrafted out of ODU doesn't have the staying power.  He will be on bench next year collecting a pay check.  He may be the answer next week but next year or the future...no.   It is like playing Colt Brennan.  Heinicke may be on the forgettable list or may just be that one game legend."
6375,2020-12-28 02:37:18,klgyxb,Need 1 more weapons still AND a field general capable qb imo
6376,2020-12-28 02:27:42,klgyxb,"He took them from NFC Championship Game favorites to missing the playoffs 2/3 years.

Yikes."
6377,2020-12-28 02:32:59,klgyxb,"His o-line gives him no pass protection whatsoever, and if you didn’t get a chance to see the Vikings last Friday, that defense is atrocious"
6378,2020-12-28 12:51:24,klgyxb,I'm pretty sure mark brunell started when we won our last playoff game.
6379,2020-12-28 06:05:19,klgyxb,Haskins has won games.
6380,2020-12-28 03:14:23,klgyxb,"I'll never forget Grossman putting together a couple great games and Steve Young during the pregame of one of our games saying that Rex was really close to being a top 10 QB in the league or something lol

Rex had some good tools and good pedigree, he just choked at the worst times and couldn't lead a team.

He also wasn't a backup kind of guy.  He was one of those guys that almost had to be the starter or else it wasn't worth it.

That's going to be Dwayne's challenge going forward in the NFL if he gets another chance.  I think he'd rather not be in the league at all if he doesn't have a starting job handed to him.  He's got a big mountain to climb."
6381,2020-12-28 02:37:43,klgyxb,I somehow remember that game for 2 things: Gronk going nuts and Vince Wilfork scoring😭😭😭
6382,2020-12-28 16:34:20,klgyxb,"Trent Green played one season for us, and led the league in QBR. The staff at the time thought it was a fluke and let him walk, didn't want to pay him. He signed with the Rams to be their starter, got injured for the season in the preseason, and Curt Warner took over. We all know what happened from there.

Edit: I was going off of memory, sorry. That was a long time ago. He had led the league in QBR for a good portion of the season. But didn't end up on top."
6383,2020-12-28 04:56:17,klgyxb,Or he might be the next Kurt Warner -- jury still out on him...or so we can all dream
6384,2020-12-28 04:54:36,klgyxb,Give us Stafford and a WR2 and we will do things. Thomas has developed into a TE1
6385,2020-12-28 02:33:41,klgyxb,Unfair on Cousins. That defense has turned into a dumpster fire now
6386,2020-12-28 02:34:33,klgyxb,"I am aware of the usual Cousins excuses. It's the same everywhere he goes no matter the year or team.

He's not a bad QB, he's just another QB who will never get over the hump."
6387,2020-12-28 16:42:27,klgyxb,I am seeing a 6-8 record with middle of the road numbers.  He missed the 99 season due to a knee injury.  I recall the tail end of the Norv Turner years and a wild card win in 1999 with Brad Johnson.  I was like 10 and didn't grow up in a football family.  It took me a while to learn the rules.   I don't have a ton of memories of RFK or the Jack Kent Cooke era.
6388,2020-12-28 02:57:18,klgyxb,"Its definitely a different defense now, but how different was it from the 2017 team to the 2018 team that missed the playoffs?"
6389,2020-12-28 02:57:52,klgyxb,Can probably make the argument the defense would be able to pay players if they didn't have Kirk's contract
6390,2020-12-28 02:37:53,klgyxb,"These are valid excuses, no? He’s unlucky

He’s not an elite, HOF QB but he’s more than decent and would easily make us division favorites consistently"
6391,2020-12-28 16:58:53,klgyxb,"Yeah, 3441 yds, 23 TD's 11 INT's 81.1 QBR. His completion % wasn't the best. 53% or something like that. It was the most hype a QB had here since Rypien had won the Super Bowl. I can't for the life of me remember who he replaced, may have been Shuler.

Edit: passer rating, not QBR."
6392,2020-12-28 03:31:40,klgyxb,We would be in a similar position since we paid for Alex Smith’s contract.
6393,2020-12-28 17:08:48,klgyxb,There was no QBR rating then. that is passer rating.  81 is sort of average to below average.  Also Gus Frerotte replaced Shuler
6394,2020-12-28 03:52:39,klgyxb,We didn't have a receiver and running back who needed to be payed too tho is what I'm saying
6395,2020-12-28 17:10:21,klgyxb,"Yeah, that's what I mean. His completion % drug that down a lot."
6396,2020-12-28 17:28:41,klgyxb,Green had a fine career and I am seeing some pro bowls in KC.  I think that was the Priest Holmes and Tony Gonzales era.  He just wasnt good with us
6397,2020-12-28 17:43:23,klgyxb,"I mean, he was here for two seasons, one completely as a back up, and the other he started 14 games and wasn't bad at all. Between our last Super Bowl, and Cousins becoming the everyday starter, he had the third best season any Washington QB has had in that time period. All I'm saying is they probably shoulda held on to the guy."

6725,2020-12-28 09:02:11,klgkar,Only correct answer.
6726,2020-12-28 20:35:24,klgkar,No I know. Now you lost twice. Haha. Haha.
6727,2020-12-28 08:33:43,klgkar,"Oh shit, here's another sub for me to join XD"
6728,2020-12-28 03:04:20,klgcjs,"Congrats, that's a great achievement. Sometimes you do need to focus on your health in other ways. The way I looked at it, sometimes I have cardio days, sometimes I have strength training days, and after I got my flu shot, I had immune system days. I was working out my immune system, and that was important too. 

I don't know how you'll feel after you recover from your next surgery, and I have not been through that. But I did have surgery for a broken nose and small nasal passages. And I credit that surgery as part of the reason I can exercise now. Before, I just couldn't breathe well enough when I tried to work out. Now I can breathe more or less like a typical person, and it's great. The ability to breathe is really important - for exercise, for sleep quality, for health, for general how you feel. I highly recommend breathing. :) So, if this makes it easier for you to breathe, it might help you along your way, even if you need to have some temporary slow downs while you focus on the immediate health issues. 

It sounds like you already have a good plan for making progress. You have past experience successfully working out at home, and you have a strong motivation to do so. I expect you'll do really well."
6729,2020-12-28 00:16:39,klew9h,He’s so unbelievably bad
6730,2020-12-28 00:18:07,klew9h,Hes terrible. They shoulda shitcanned him midgame.
6731,2020-12-28 01:16:49,klew9h,Everyone who said he should have been suspended/cut after the strippers was right. I thought he gave the team the best chance without Alex and I was dead wrong. I think we could have won this game if Heinike had started.
6732,2020-12-28 00:19:00,klew9h,Watching ASSKINS play gives me depression.
6733,2020-12-28 00:29:53,klew9h,He has no upside to his game. There's nothing he does consistently well. It's amazing that he's somehow regressed significantly since this time last year...
6734,2020-12-28 01:20:23,klew9h,I was texting this to some of my friends during the game... at least Josh Johnson was fun to watch
6735,2020-12-28 01:17:33,klew9h,"He has such an ugly release, almost as bad as Tebow's but at least Tebow won a playoff game goddamn"
6736,2020-12-28 02:19:51,klew9h,"Dwayne Haskins is so fucking bad, that Ron should have burned a TO in First quarter, walked out onto the field, taken the ball from Dwayne, and had him walk off field in shame.

Fuck that dude.  He will not make it anywhere either.  He is spoiled idiot."
6737,2020-12-28 01:08:57,klew9h,I honestly haven’t seen this level of poor performance since pre-season games where you have a QB auditioning for the practice squad.
6738,2020-12-28 03:28:30,klew9h,Hey Josh Johnson was pretty good
6739,2020-12-28 00:20:07,klew9h,"I mean he literally has not been worse than Sanchez. However, in terms of investment versus output I would take 6 Sanchez's before another Haskins."
6740,2020-12-28 02:01:26,klew9h,Haskins is like an immobile Tim Tebow
6741,2020-12-28 01:19:38,klew9h,"Remember earlier in the year when we were second guessing Ron benching him, lol?"
6742,2020-12-28 03:56:26,klew9h,How the fuck did he look good last year for those 2-3 games? Is he just slow learning this offense? I mean it’s been a full season at this point
6743,2020-12-28 00:26:55,klew9h,Heath Shuler vs Dwayne Haskins???
6744,2020-12-28 04:46:33,klew9h,smh i was so hyped seeing his off season training last summer. oh boy did he prove us wrong
6745,2020-12-28 13:17:37,klew9h,"I have definitely been in the camp of ""let Dwayne sit and learn for a few season, and maybe his dumb brain will catch up, and all that physical talent won't be wasted"". Nope, not now, CUT HIS ASS!"
6746,2020-12-28 05:56:23,klew9h,Possibly ever for this franchise
6747,2020-12-28 06:24:07,klew9h,"Josh Johnson was good. He wasn't great, but he won us a game and actually was competent on the field. 

Haskins is every bad trait of every NFL quarterback rolled into one QB."
6748,2020-12-28 14:28:13,klew9h,"Sanchez was as bad as you possibly can be for us in his start, so let's call it a tie."
6749,2020-12-28 14:31:42,klew9h,"Kids in this sub are too young to remember Danny Wuerffel, Sage Rosenfeld, or even John Beck."
6750,2020-12-28 04:49:33,klew9h,The second coming of Ryan Leaf
6751,2020-12-28 15:21:21,klew9h,Shane Matthews?
6752,2020-12-28 15:59:27,klew9h,"Why would they not sign josh Rosen off TB practice squad before SF did, he couldn’t have been any worse then Haskins yesterday. Dumbfounded"
6753,2020-12-28 03:26:04,klew9h,"I said at half Haskins should be pulled, I really think had Rivera made that change we would have won... even with that shit no fumble fumble return... the team just looked so energized with Haskins out"
6754,2020-12-28 03:59:54,klew9h,I agree
6755,2020-12-28 14:38:15,klew9h,It was those 2 drives last game where he actually looked like a QB. It gave us just a smidge of hope.
6756,2020-12-28 02:09:49,klew9h,So many tipped passes
6757,2020-12-28 02:17:27,klew9h,Tebow is a lot better...Haskins is a disaster. He’s about to have a lot of time to think about it
6758,2020-12-28 07:38:54,klew9h,Ha!  Like getting yanked off the mound.
6759,2020-12-28 04:49:02,klew9h,I mean for a walk on guy I’ll give him credit lmao
6760,2020-12-28 12:31:33,klew9h,"Sanchez actually took the Jets to the playoffs for the first time in many years and beat the Patriots in the playoffs. Haskins is far worse than Sanchez was, what are you judging by, arm strength alone?"
6761,2020-12-28 17:54:27,klew9h,"6/14 38Yds 0TD 2INT

6/15 36Yds 0TD 2INT 1 fumble lost

One is Sanchez in one half against the Giants and one is Haskins in the first half of the biggest game of his career."
6762,2020-12-28 03:21:03,klew9h,Who doesn’t work hard or take personal responsibility
6763,2020-12-28 13:06:53,klew9h,"Getting yards in junk time vs. the Seahawks after an abysmal first half does not mean he ""looked good"". Stats do not account for the number of 3 and outs and the inability to move the chains when he is on the field. Alex Smith may be boring to watch, but he can string drives together that gives our defense time to rest. It speaks volumes that literally every other backup QB we have brought on field this season has given this team a breath of life that Dwayne is incapable of. Kyle Allen, Alex Smith, and now Taylor Heinecke all make seem to inspire the team to play well, but it's pretty clear they have zero faith in Haskins."
6764,2020-12-28 15:08:40,klew9h,"It was really 6 quarters, 4 against the 6-7 Eagles and then 2 against the 3-11 Giants before he got hurt. That got inflated over the offseason into ""a few games"" and ""improving throughout the season"" in the minds of hopeful fans. To be fair, fans thought he would keep working and getting better.

It could be that almost any QB will have a few good quarters if he gets in enough games, because he catches a team on a bad week or it's just a good matchup for the team."
6765,2020-12-28 01:22:52,klew9h,"Lol, Haskins definitely in the conversation of worst QB busts in the last twenty years.  Jamarcus, Paxton, Manziel and him are on their own special tier of bad."
6766,2020-12-28 02:52:43,klew9h,The cost of Shuler gives him the edge.
6767,2020-12-28 14:23:15,klew9h,Haskins may legitimately be a bigger disaster than Leaf was.
6768,2020-12-28 09:59:34,klew9h,I said before he was born his dad should've pulled.
6769,2020-12-28 03:20:55,klew9h,"Yeah, he'll be thinking about how the WFT done messed up."
6770,2020-12-28 14:20:37,klew9h,"Tebow was an athletic freak like Taysom Hill. He could’ve stuck around for a while as a gadget player.

Haskins has nothing positive about his physical attributes and his mental game is the worst of any QB since at least Manziel and possibly as terrible as Russell or Leaf."
6771,2020-12-28 13:25:50,klew9h,Sanchez game vs the Giants in 2018 might be the single worst QB performance I have ever seen in a Washington jersey.
6772,2020-12-28 17:48:55,klew9h,tebow also **won games**
6773,2020-12-28 14:32:30,klew9h,"He said last year. Haskins was starting to look like a competent starter toward the end of the year last year. He seemed like he was finally starting to get the speed of the league. Before he got hurt against the Giants he looked like a pro bowler and played really solid against the Eagles the game before. There was a reason to have a little bit of hope coming in to this year, but obviously that didn't work out."
6774,2020-12-28 11:44:27,klew9h,At least manziel  could actually play a little. He just couldn't get out his own way off the field.
6775,2020-12-28 14:36:16,klew9h,"I get uncomfortable when this kid keeps getting compared to guys that were straight up drug addicts and criminals like Leaf and Russell. 

Also go back and check out Ryan Leaf's numbers. It isn't even close. Dwayne has already far exceeded anything Ryan Leaf ever did."
6776,2020-12-28 13:47:14,klew9h,"It's definitely probably close to it, but to say this week's performance doesn't rival it is silly. Haskins was something like 30 attempts with 40 total yards passing, 2 picks, and a fumble by half time. That said, Sanchez was never our starter, probably didn't take any snaps in practice, and was brought in the game only because there was nobody else to play, but Haskins was supposed to be our staring QB.

Moreover, Sanchez actually has a history of modest success in this league, something Haskins will never match. Haskins will never lead a team in this league to a playoff birth, make it to the AFC championship game in two straight years (beating Phillip Rivers' Chargers, Peyton Manning's Colts, and Tom Brady's Patriots in the postseason), or lead his team to an 11-5 regular season record. Was Sanchez ever a QB with top tier talent? No, but he was a better QB than Haskins will ever be."
6777,2020-12-28 13:54:16,klew9h,"Sanchez was 6/14 for 38 yards, 2 picks, 1 returned for a TD, was sacked 5 times and had a QBR of 0.7.  We were down 40-0 after 1 drive of the second half, when he was benched to the 5-8 Giants.

I have never been more embarrased by a QB performance until yesterday smdh. 

Haskins is worse because of the capital invested into him (mid 1st and traded a 2nd to grab Sweat), and the fact he plays almost as bad as Sanchez did in week 16 of his 2nd season, whereas Sanchez had a couple days reps to figure out.

I'm not saying Sanchez is a worse QB, just that that was the single most disgusting QB performance in a Redskins jersey I ever remember."

6863,2020-12-27 06:35:00,kkv415,That's his personal choice but I don't think it's good to glorify this. Long-term sleep deprivation causes brain damage.
6864,2020-12-27 11:15:57,kkv415,"I think The Rock is terrific and it's great for him that he can get by on so little sleep. It's not the same for everyone though, one thing that's helped me personally is accepting that I'm someone that needs a little bit more sleep than the average. Otherwise I gradually burn out over the course of 8 weeks.

Occasionally we'll see a poster on here asking how they can get up in the morning but they're only sleeping five or six hours a night. Some productivity type people glorify getting up super early, or getting by on little sleep, and while that's great for them, we need to be aware that they're in the minority, the most of us need, actually need in terms of our health and wellbeing, more sleep than that. People (such as other road users) can die when others don't sleep enough."

6867,2020-12-27 17:49:42,kkv415,"I don’t have the source but I’ve read that some small percentage of people have a gene that lets them be fully functional with fewer hours of sleep than regular people. It’s been speculated that high achievers who claim to need fewer hours of sleep, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, are able to do this because they have this gene. Most people cannot maintain set hours and have time to work out and have quiet time to themselves during the day — there just aren’t enough hours, if you get the sleep a normal person needs to be healthy and functional."
6868,2020-12-28 11:37:24,kkv415,"I think Margaret Thatcher claimed to sleep about five hours per night. I wouldn't aspire to be like her (no politics) but I'm jealous.

When I was about 19/20 I used to procrastinate like a mofo then right up to deadline time I'd sleep late and get up super early to get my work done. I drank a lot of coffee and soda and managed to function.

These days I'm wrecked without my 8/9 hours and I don't recognise that person that used to study, socialise and go clubbing on about 5/6 hours sleep per night."
6869,2020-12-27 05:57:11,kkv40a,"> Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is one of those rare people who don’t need as much sleep

This is so wrong and dangerous thing to glorify. 

That type of argument is like saying ""I never feel bad after smoking a cigarette so I must be one of those rare people who aren't affected by cigarettes""

Just because you can function well after only getting 3-5 hours of sleep doesn't mean it isn't damaging **in the long run**.

The negative effects of little sleep is noticed many many years later, sometimes when you're getting a lot older.

I really suggest looking into books/articles/podcasts/ted talks with Matthew Walker, a sleep scientist/expert who talks in depth about this.

DO NOT get less than 7 hours of sleep, people."
6870,2020-12-27 06:32:53,kkv40a,"I call BS. Love the Rock, and I have no doubts about how hard he works. But you can’t build a body like that on so little rest. Tired of celebrities pushing the “sacrifice your sleep” mantra. It’s incredibly unhealthy."

6872,2020-12-27 05:56:02,kkv40a,"Same with Cena. I can't remember his exact words but he often only sleeps 3 hours because he wants to get up and start the day. Also gets a lot done for tons of hours. I personally don't think it's healthy to constantly sleep few hours, but then again both Cena and Dwayne are as fit as bulls. It's inconceivable, but there you have it."
6873,2020-12-27 19:52:06,kkv40a,To put it in perspective I read the same interview right after this one that was given to Lebron James who says he sleeps anywhere from 8-12 hours a day. Do what you think is healthy.

I've got a friend who swears everyone can get by on less sleep than 7 hours and it's all about willpower...casually forgetting that everyone in his family also happens to only ever sleep for about 6 hours even when trying to sleep longer.

7.5 hours is my optimum but if I need to, I can go down to 6. I've gotta catch up after a couple days of this however."
6876,2020-12-27 20:01:52,kkv40a,Do you think that EVERYONE in the world needs at least 7 hours of sleep? Or do you think there are exceptions out there?
6877,2021-01-07 13:05:37,kkv40a,Agreed...number one goal this year is to sleep as much as possible.
6878,2020-12-27 20:28:15,kkv40a,"There are exceptions to mostly all rules in life but that's besides the point.

My point is:

Dwayne is not one of those people **just because he feels good the morning after**. That is NOT proof in any way shape or form.

If you **really** want to know you need **scientific** proof that you have a certain gene that makes your body not require as much sleep as 95%+ of people. Just basing it as how you feel the morning after is just as a invalid argument as the smoking analogy I wrote about."
6879,2020-12-27 22:25:49,kkv40a,"I’m not sure if 7 hours of sleep is the exact amount that humans must be getting, but I remember there was a really good NPR Hidden Brain podcast episode about sleep, where they pointed out that out of all the adaptions that humans have gone through with evolution throughout hundreds of centuries, a decent amount of sleep has been of the things that have not changed much. Sleep is vital to function optimally, and even if people can function well off 4-5 hours of sleep, that’s not to say that 8 hours is unnecessary"

The 26 American Oscar Winners for Actors & Actresses for the last 20 years

2000-2009 (8/10) Washington, Brody, Penn, Foxx, Hoffman, Whitaker, Penn, Bridges

2010-2019 Actor (5/10)  McConaughey, DiCaprio, C. Affleck, Malek, Phoenix

2000-2009 (5/10) Roberts, Berry, Swank, Witherspoon, Bullock

2010-2019 (8/10) Portman, Streep, Lawrence, Moore, Larson, Stone, McDormand, Zellweger

Which 14 don't deserve it? :)

I think you may be observing that there are a lot of crap Hollywood / American produced films out there, and consequently you are observing a lot of poor acting out there as well.

A lot of these American actors / actress also act in and continue to act in off season Broadways and independent films just like Coleman and fellow UK actors did in her early days and continue to do today. Most people are just not aware of this fact, because of the strong impression of the more well known films they appear in.

Some of the above have struck gold early in their lives and have been typecasted (Arguably Roberts & Sandra Bullock but others less so). Some Oscars are recognition of a body of work (despite Oscars being meant to be annual recognition). My own opinion is that Coleman's win is not just an acknwledgement of her sole performance in the Favourite but a recognition of her previously less known work as a journeywoman actor who rightly deserved her Oscar.

So again can you share with us which 14 didn't deserve an Oscar for the last 20 years :)?

Cheers."
6918,2020-12-27 00:46:11,kksvck,"How many Tom Hanks movies have you actually seen? Because I find it kind of unbelievable that you list the American actor most known for his warmth, relatability, and range as being wooden and lacking in range. You think he's playing the same character in The Terminal and The Ladykillers and The Green Mile and Cast Away and Philadelphia and Road to Perdition and Saving Private Ryan and The Money Pit and Apollo 13 and Forrest Gump and Big and You've Got Mail and A League of Their Own and Captain Phillips? You think [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng95gpwSjZU) is a wooden performance? You think [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M8szlSa-8o) is? How can anyone think [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L4ltYYn4FM) is wooden???"
6919,2020-12-27 00:15:41,kksvck,"Robert De Niro got pigeonholed as a gangster after the Godfather, but he deserves the title of great actor if only for his performance in Taxi Driver. The new Joker movie took a ton of inspiration from it. 

As for Tom Hanks, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is a good example of him actually playing a different person. He does a pretty great job emulating Mr. Rogers. 

I think you're conflating the popular movies the American public eats up with how good actors are. Taking money to play a character that doesn't stress your acting isn't the same as being a bad actor."
6920,2020-12-27 00:21:25,kksvck,"It seems your larger view is that US actors aren’t as good as UK actors because of range.  

I don’t believe that’s true - plenty of American actors show range and spend time on Broadway as well - but I don’t know if a long list of diverse actors changed your perception.

When making a movie, I’m not really sure that your breadth of talent is relevant.  Your depth and portrayal of the character is.

The Oscars are recognizing roles played that year for a specific movie; they’re not a lifetime achievement award for range.

Does an actors range result in better movie and films? Not really.  Films get better if they can cast the perfect person for the role."
6921,2020-12-26 23:59:15,kksvck,So do you think Dwayne Johnson Is a good actor then? 😆
6922,2020-12-27 00:19:06,kksvck,"This isn't a ChangeMyView but I'd like to ask...

 In the UK it is tradition that actors either go direct to drama school (and do a three year acting degree there), or attend Oxford or Cambridge (get involved in amateur dramatics there, e.g. the Footlights) and then go to drama school afterwards. They will then spend a few years in London earning nothing while doing auditions etc. As a result, British actors are principally white, from the south of England, attended public/private (public means elite private school in the UK) and are from an upper middle class background. Some working class actors can get in, but they often have to rise through the ranks via soap operas and alike... they are rare.

What is the situation like in the US?"
6923,2020-12-27 01:37:48,kksvck,"Like Cartman said, Tom Hanks couldn’t act his way out of a paper bag. At least not in this rut he’s been in for a while in the roles you talk about. But go watch Philadelphia. That was his early acclaim, and he was damn good at it.

Check out Leonardo DiCaprio. He’s played so many different amazing roles that people were wondering when he’d finally get an Oscar. Go all the way back to Basketball Diaries and What’s Eating Gilbert Grape to see how good he’s always been. 

And Kevin Spacey. He is an excellent actor, although I’d say his Oscar performance wasn’t even his best. Watch Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, and he made The Usual Suspects. Really my favorite was him as an insane criminal in the 80s TV show Wiseguy. His roles have been quite varied, absolutely no rut or typecast. He has a long theater history too, in acting that gave him two Tony awards, and he was the director of the Old Vic in London."
6924,2020-12-27 00:10:44,kksvck,"I would change your view in the sense that the Oscars are generally understood to be an industry promotion tool, and not a critically serious recognition of quality acting."
6925,2020-12-27 02:15:18,kksvck,"Oscars are awarded to the actors who receive the most votes from the 7,000+ voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. You could argue that the voters have bad taste, or that there are racial and gender biases that disadvantage certain demographics. But to argue that the actor who received a majority of votes doesn't deserve an award that's given on the basis of receiving a majority of votes doesn't seem sound to me."
