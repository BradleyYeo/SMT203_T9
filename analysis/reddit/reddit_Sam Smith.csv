15,2020-02-05 14:39:38,ezaamf,"How do you have time to watch all of these, I only watched four movies in theatres in January. (maybe it's cause I'm a college student...)

Anyway, my ratings for all four (which you watched as well):

* *1917:* 8.5/10. Amazing experience. That is all.
* *Like a Boss:* 2/10. Shockingly offensive and unoriginal, and wastes an amazing cast. But it's the fun kind of bad movie that you can laugh at for how bad it is.
* *Bad Boys For Life:* 8/10. Genuinely enjoyed all of it, I was so happy when I found out this was good.
* *Dolittle:* 4/10. The script is awful but the cast makes the most out of it. A magical experience thanks to the CGI and cinematography, however, and again is pretty fun despite being bad."

**RW** - Alright, u/Wizard_Baruffio. LET'S DUEL.

Ace is not bad. He's not especially good, but he's not bad, and he's certainly on par with Nehemiah. Evelyn > Veronica. Ashley > Amanda. Derrick is obviously better than Cohutta, but Cohutta is NICER, so I think you all know what to do. 

Sorry, u/dolfan2354, but today you're going DOWN.

**RR** - I LOVED the Rivals II final. And OH MY GOD, Jenny. Landon and Turbo would be a fun matchup to watch. I think from there, u/wade5554 walks away easy. I'd take Jenny over both Jamie and Svetlana, and though we haven't seen Da'Vonne in a final, I'll assume she can keep up. Adam Kuhn was a very good competitor who was stuck with Brittany.

The Road Rules bracket is having a fucking slug fest in this final. I have no idea who to vote for. My vote is going to ""You Cannot Copy My Walk."" I think this really comes down to the body bags and they have the muscle to carry that extra weight. I really don't trust Knight, Jamie, or Svetlana at this part of the final. Wes looked half dead at this portion, Bananas was dead almost this whole final. I think Landon would be doing everything for this team at this stage, whereas there is some real muscle on the other squad. Turbo is small but strong and dedicated. Adam is a brick shithouse of unproven muscle. Jenny is She-Hulk. Day should do just fine carrying body bags with Adam."

32,2020-02-05 22:11:09,eza54e,"my thoughts!

**RW** - again voting for Adore Delano 2020. Ashley K and Ace aren't amazing but they have both run and done well in finals - especially recent ones. Amanda still hasn't been in one and the finals Veronica won weren't the same level as the Rivals 3 final. I think Ev could figure out the puzzles and Cohutta could help with eating.

**RR** - oooohhh this is a good match-up. we know Turbo can't swim, so can his team make up for the time they lose after the first part of the final? Da'Vonne has asthma, so will she be able to complete a final in the Thai heat? but more glaringly than either of them - Knight doesn't stick out to me as a good competitor... and his shoulder injuries would definitely flair up while carrying the bodybags. so this is TOUGH. and who can eat??

I'm gonna vote for /u/willtwerkf0rfood because I worry equally about Da'Vonne and Knight - and Landon is clearly a great team leader and motivator, so I think he can bring his team to a victory. Landon and Knight also seem like the type who will be able to eat gross sh!t, and I think Jamie would grit her teeth through it too."

42,2020-02-05 09:51:51,ez6rzy,"There were a few pretty large and relatively mixed-opinion posts on this sub when the announcement was made. Personally I don’t know too much of her music, although most of the commenters that did said her general “style” is quite different than “Bad Guy”, her most popular song. I personally am excited simply because it represents something new for the series that we haven’t seen in a while. If you’re interested in reading other people’s opinions just search her name in the sub bar.

I feel like making these kinds of posts, just fishing  for negative opinions or controversy is kinda lame though. Whatever your opinions, saying that she’s talentless and only famous because of her brother’s skills is pretty low."
43,2020-02-05 12:10:39,ez6rzy,"The series has had weird, experimental tracks since the Moore era. There's a lot more to Bond music than just booming Shirley Bassey ballads. I think Eilish could bring something unique and fresh and give the series some much needed relevance to younger fans."
44,2020-03-16 02:40:05,ez6rzy,"Half the old people are going to be yelling what is she saying during the beginning of the movie when they can't hear her whispering gimmick.

It should be given to a more mature artist. A teenager shouldn't be singing for a James Bond movie. Teens don't know the complexities of adult relationships, And neither does Taylor Swift yet either.

I wouldn't mind seeing Katy Perry get it, Love to Adelle getting it. My favorite is the guy from Soundgarden with casino Royale. Next to the Duran Duran one. And McCartney #3."
45,2020-02-05 11:25:48,ez6rzy,"It will probably be bad because she and he brother are composing the song, not the actual composer for the film (Hans Zimmer), so it will end up being totally out of place with the rest of the score.  The best theme songs in the past have be co-composed with the score composer, so I don't know why they don't do it that way anymore."
46,2020-02-05 10:14:17,ez6rzy,"On the one hand, I think it’s really cool they went with an unknown. On the other hand, she’s only unknown to me because I don’t know shit about current popular music. I’ve only ever heard that one song that one the Grammy and I wasn’t impressed, but I’m sure she’s probably a talented singer."
47,2020-02-05 10:02:23,ez6rzy,Terrible choice. No class at all.
48,2020-02-05 09:55:01,ez6rzy,I agree I was maybe overly critical of her on this post. But as a music producer myself and knowing that finneas her brother wrote most of her biggest hits I have to give him recognition! But Yeha I don’t mind Billie she can sing very well no doubt. I’m just Intrested to see how her soft voice works out on a bond theme as most of the other singers who have been on the soundtrack are powerhouse singers
49,2020-02-05 12:30:02,ez6rzy,Hopefully this is what happens. But I just think voices like Sam smith and Adele fit the bond theme so much more. But I don’t wanna jump the gun! We will see!
50,2020-03-16 11:54:01,ez6rzy,"Taylor swift doesn’t even have a goood voice tho it’s generic af. At least Billie has something unique going. The song has grown on me massively however I agree with your points for sure but oh well it’s done now. There were deffo artists that are more fitting but at the end of the day the movie business is a ‘business’ and Billie eilish and Finneas (her brother) are the most talked about and popular artists in the world atm and they just won like 10 Grammys between them. 

I agree it’s not the best choice but I get it for business reasons tho! I deffo wouldn’t choose Katy Perry 😂 I do like her but she fits the vibe worse then Billie tbh. Imo the best choice of singer for this movie would have been Lana Del Rey she’s perfect. If you don’t know her check out the song she sang for the great gatsby ‘young and beautiful’ she would have been the perfect fit. And she’s older"
51,2020-02-06 04:43:12,ez6rzy,Zimmer and Eilish have both acknowledged in interviews that they’ve met and collaborated.
52,2020-02-05 11:35:07,ez6rzy,I pray that they are only composing for that one song? Haha
53,2020-02-05 10:15:49,ez6rzy,Hahahahaha Yeha I think it’s just because you don’t listen to current music. She’s more famous then sam smith who sang the theme and almost as famous as Adele. She’s probally the most famous artist in the world atm so she’s deffo not an unknown 😂😂
54,2020-02-05 10:17:20,ez6rzy,And if your talking about bad guy? Tbf most of her music could work and is very ‘bond themed’ bad guy is the exception ahha. Most of her other music is soft and emtjonal. However I still wouldn’t have chosen her to sing the theme but hey let’s give it a chance and see how it is
55,2020-02-05 10:03:05,ez6rzy,You don’t need class to sing the theme 😂. They don’t show her haha. You just need to sound good and fit the sound
56,2020-02-05 11:30:09,ez6rzy,"This is also true.  Bond has become so watered down throughout this Craig era that it's now just another generic big budget action series like Fast and Furious where they just choose some generic popular music to play during the credits.  Even if the song ends up being okay on its own, there will be nothing Bond-like about it.  It will just be any other top 40 pop song on the radio."
57,2020-02-05 12:05:26,ez6rzy,"I hadn’t heard of her before this. Sam Smith on the other hand, as dreadful as he is, is very famous. Maybe it depends on where you are. I’m in the UK"
58,2020-02-05 10:18:19,ez6rzy,I had no idea who Sam Smith was either. Still don’t.
59,2020-02-05 10:20:07,ez6rzy,"Maybe they chose her because Bond is a tough guy, who likes it very rough guy. Also, he eats bacon, and likes martinis shaken."
60,2020-02-05 10:45:19,ez6rzy,"I disagree with that. Style and class is what we would like to associate James Bond with. Her personality, style and message just doesn't suit the Bond brand."
61,2020-02-05 11:31:52,ez6rzy,"How is she going to ""fit the sound"" when she doesn't even know what Han Zimmer's score sounds like and has not collaborated with him at all?  That's like taking a shot in the dark.  There's a very small chance it could work, but it's highly improbable that her theme song will fit in with the rest of the score."
62,2020-02-05 12:12:22,ez6rzy,You do realise the last two songs won Oscars right? The producers know what they're doing. Bond music has had a broad mix of stylish ballads and contemporary pop over the past 50+ years. It's never been married to one style.
63,2020-02-05 18:34:39,ez6rzy,"Before Craig we had 

-Madonna
-Garbage
-Sheryl Crowe
-Tina Turner 
-Gladys Knight
-Aha
-Duran Duran

Only two of those I wouldn’t call generic pop"
64,2020-02-05 16:30:16,ez6rzy,Daniel Craig is my favoruite bond hoesntly and he is too many people. And casino royale is my favoruite bond film. Even if you prefer the classic bonds theres no denying craig has done a great job
65,2020-02-05 12:28:58,ez6rzy,Why do u not like Sam smith 😂
66,2020-02-05 12:28:23,ez6rzy,Billie Elish is much more famous then Sam smith but yes she an American artist and Sam it British.   I’m also from the uk but Billie is global. Everyone knows her name
67,2020-02-05 10:18:43,ez6rzy,Surely u know who Adele is at least 😂
68,2020-02-05 10:19:29,ez6rzy,Even if you don’t listen too popular music you would have heard some of these artists music on the radio or in a store as they play them 24/7 so it’s inevitable
69,2020-02-05 10:19:39,ez6rzy,What music do u listen to?
70,2020-02-05 10:46:00,ez6rzy,Yeha but all you hear is her voice and u don’t see her in the film. Her voice could suit it potentially
71,2020-02-05 18:31:28,ez6rzy,A band called Garbage once did the theme song and it was great
72,2020-02-05 11:35:47,ez6rzy,Some guy replied to this post and said that apparbelty Hans Zimmer isn’t composing this one. He’s composing the rest but finneas and Billie are doing this entire song
73,2020-02-05 11:35:58,ez6rzy,Which could mean it’s even less bond 😂
74,2020-02-05 13:13:21,ez6rzy,"I think it has been decades since winning an Oscar really meant anything.  I don't see that as an endorsement at all.  Just look at the crap that is nominated this year.

I think it's hilarious that out of all the great Bond songs over the years, it is Adele's mediocre Skyfall and Smith's horrendous Writing on the Wall that won Oscars.  That tells you all you need to know about the poor tastes of the Academy."
75,2020-02-05 13:30:39,ez6rzy,"I’m not a fan of pop music; I do my best to avoid it. But some musicians are ubiquitous, and Sam Smith is one of them. I’ve honestly never heard of this girl before, however, or her music."
76,2020-02-05 10:21:56,ez6rzy,I do.
77,2020-02-05 10:21:24,ez6rzy,Music old people like.
78,2020-02-05 13:10:33,ez6rzy,"Yes, and that's my point.  Zimmer is composing the main film score which is going to have a certain sound to it, but Eilish and her brother are composing only the theme song, so the theme will sound totally out of place alongside Zimmer's score."
79,2020-02-05 16:28:59,ez6rzy,Skyfall is an absolutle bond classic and a triumph ahha. It is the most bond soundng song ever and its perfect with the scene. But music is subjective so to each their own
80,2020-02-05 16:31:01,ez6rzy,Fair play. She is very famous these days
81,2020-02-05 10:24:35,ez6rzy,"I find her pretty easy listening tho honestly on most songs apart from bad guy. Like I could see her singing in this style working on bond https://youtu.be/pbMwTqkKSps

But I think there were better choices"
82,2020-02-05 16:24:05,ez6rzy,yeah I agree. Stupid idea
83,2020-02-05 10:30:47,ez6rzy,She definitely has a nice voice. But this song did nothing for me.
84,2020-02-05 10:31:26,ez6rzy,Totally fair. I’m not blown away by her either. But who knows maybe the bond song will be good. I’ve loved all the other bond songs!

101,2020-02-06 16:20:10,eyx7lo,"That song and “real hero” have been getting served to me via Apple Music. Lol. 

“Real hero” at least 3-4 times a day (I am listening to music 20 out of 24 hours a day.)

So much that I had to tell Siri that I don’t like the song (not true but it plays 3-4 times a day). 

I was actually happy to hear “Under your spell”. That one is my favorite and so is the scene from The movie."
102,2020-02-04 18:10:08,eyu553,My eyes!!!
103,2020-02-04 18:51:45,eyu553,7 WR going by pick 22 is a tough pill to swallow.
104,2020-02-04 18:08:16,eyu553,You're killing my eyes with this format. It's got to be spaced out.
105,2020-02-04 18:12:13,eyu553,"Dude, format and I don't like the pick because we already invested so much at the DE position."
106,2020-02-04 18:09:53,eyu553,Got damn this formatting
107,2020-02-04 19:14:08,eyu553,I'd say give Gross-Matos to Baltimore. They need pass-rush help and that's even before/if they do resign Judon.
108,2020-02-04 18:28:49,eyu553,"I really don't get the Miami pick. Tua may have injury concerns, but even with those concerns its unlikely that good of a QB prospect falls to 5 any other year. Miami can go OL with any of their 13 other picks, especually if he sits behind Fitzmagic for a year. The dropoff for QBs is much steeper than OL. Even from a job preservation stand point, if your QB of the future from round 2 doesn't pan out or if Tua is better than who you picked, you're out of a job."
109,2020-02-04 18:34:42,eyu553,"Humphrey returned to school, also I seriously doubt we draft Queen hes way too light for our liking we basically don't play LBs under 235 outside of ST."
110,2020-02-04 19:01:39,eyu553,Why is everyone rating Queen so high all of the sudden? He has a lot of flaws and physical negatives. He had a decent championship game but I don't think it was enough to make a mid day 2 pick into a top 25 pick. Is it just because it's a bad year for LBs?
111,2020-02-04 18:53:50,eyu553,"The Bucs young CBs balled out at the end of the year.

Safety maybe, but not CB.  I would expect O-line or D-Line in that order."
112,2020-02-04 19:02:04,eyu553,"I doubt anyone is going to take Becton with Wirfs still on the board. Becton could very likely flop and Wirfs can start day one. I don't hate AZ going offensive line, but Wirfs is superior IMO. Cleveland would chance it on Becton if the top 3 are gone although I highly doubt they will have to considering Miami is going Tua and the Chargers might also grab a QB.

Gross-Matos also isnt making it to Green Bay (who wouldn't draft him if he fell there anyway). Seattle needs help on the offensive line but edge is their biggest need. I wouldn't complain if we grabbed Jackson, but Gross-Matos seems more likely. If the Hawks dont take him, Baltimore 100% will.

Packers may very well go linebacker or even wide receiver. If those needs aren't there, it wouldn't surprise me if they trade out of the first especially since they lack draft capital this year."
113,2020-02-04 21:04:02,eyu553,You don’t see Herbert going in the 1st round?
114,2020-02-04 22:23:54,eyu553,Miami will take a QB in the first round
115,2020-02-04 20:24:18,eyu553,"I really dont like the vikings going for a safety in the first round. Even if Harris leaves, a mid round pick or a vet should do it while there is a bigger need at CB, OLine or DT."
116,2020-02-05 02:38:55,eyu553,"I like your first two Miami picks. QB can wait a year or two. I imagine another pass rusher or protector in the first. I don't think RB's start coming off the board til the 2nd. I like Swift and Taylor over Dobbins too.

I keep dreaming we trade down with Carolina. They take Tua and we take Isaiah Simmons AND Chaisson."
117,2020-02-05 05:11:38,eyu553,"Most important position in Patricia's D is the nose tackle. Second most important position is the corner. 

But I would be SHOCKED if he bets his job on a rookie at either position."
118,2020-02-04 19:10:34,eyu553,It is but that's how deep and talented this WR class is.
119,2020-02-05 15:52:10,eyu553,It's an insane draft class for the position though. Unlikely but not impossible.
120,2020-02-04 18:16:25,eyu553,Fixed
121,2020-02-04 18:17:18,eyu553,I wasn't sure who else to give them with no more first round receivers on the board they go BPA.
122,2020-02-04 19:24:23,eyu553,I would say Baltimore or Seattle. Wouldn't shock me if the Ravens leapfrog a couple spots to land him.
123,2020-02-04 18:32:27,eyu553,That's fair but Tua as a prospect kinda scares me. He has an injury history and he played with elite talent at Alabama. There is no telling how he is gonna play with talent that isn't elite. I question whether or not he is the type of guy who can elevate the talent around him. Until its certain that he is 100 percent healthy I dont think the dolphins are a good fit because of there lack of talent offensively.
124,2020-02-04 18:48:31,eyu553,Fixed that pick it is now Grant Delpit. I think The Patriots overlook the size concern in favor of a potentially very good cover man.
125,2020-02-04 19:12:22,eyu553,I like Queen because it seemed like every play in the national championship  he was around the ball. I also think he is gonna have a great combine.
126,2020-02-04 19:11:31,eyu553,I almost gave them Delpit but In my opinion good corners can make average safeties look really good and I'm waiting to see what they do with all of there d line free agents.
127,2020-02-04 19:13:56,eyu553,I think it's time for Seattle to get Russ some o line help. And with them picking Collier last year I dont think they go back to back DE. I do agree with you on Becton but I think he is gonna have a good combine for a guy his size and shoot up boards.
128,2020-02-04 21:17:41,eyu553,"With the emphasis that Ballard puts on the Senior Bowl, I would be shocked if the Colts pass on Herbert."
129,2020-02-04 22:22:00,eyu553,"I disagree a lot. We have only 1 safety on roster next year, but arguably decent depth at CB. Sure Rhodes looked like ass, but unless you forecast him getting cut on top of is losing our CBs 2 and 3 then I don't think they go CB in the first and rely on Hughes and Hill to step up.   
OL is tough as there aren't good tackles at the end of the first and it's an over pay for any of the iOL guys there.  
DT (3T) has been a ""need"" since Floyd got hurt yet we always make due because we coach DLine talent well.   
I actually really like Delpit, and while going from Harris to him may or may not be an upgrade, it's a move we might need to make with our cap.  
Tl;Dr before FA where we likely cut people, Safety is a viable option for the Vikes"
130,2020-02-04 19:40:36,eyu553,"We would take BPA, not fill a need anyway.  Especially not that deep unless for some reason we had Reagor super high on our board."
131,2020-02-05 17:18:14,eyu553,"I think that can go 2 ways though, talented and deeper position classes sometimes make teams feel they can wait and get a really talented guy at that position for good value in the 2-4 round range, allowing them to grab a higher-level player at a less deep position in the first. Need/fit obviously plays in."
132,2020-02-04 18:28:33,eyu553,Kenneth Murray
133,2020-02-04 18:31:58,eyu553,"Kenneth Murray would be the better investment, or trade to the top of the 2nd round with a team who is looking to come back into the 1st."
134,2020-02-04 18:55:05,eyu553,I mean we haven't in the past to my knowledge we haven't really played any LBs under like 235-240
135,2020-02-04 19:14:32,eyu553,"Fair enough, the amount of FAs on the D-line is kind of insane.  Whatever they do there will shape their draft strategy."
136,2020-02-04 19:23:26,eyu553,"Collier is absolute garbage and just about every Hawks fan lost their shit as soon as he was picked. It's a similar situation to Jackson.

Seattle's O-Line isnt egregious. It was terrible after injuries riddled them, but early in the season we were holding our own. Duane Brown is great when he plays as is Justin Britt. Ifedi and Iupati need to go. But we had one of the lowest pressure rates in the NFL. Ansah had 2.5 sacks. We need pressure even if Clowney signs with us. Wilson has dealt with bad o-lines for a long time.

Seattle has a ton of picks this year. We can mix and mash draft picks on the o-line but we need a bonafide stud on the edge."
137,2020-02-05 04:48:48,eyu553,I’d be fine to pass on love if ceedee falls to us but there’s no way ballard wouldn’t snatch herbert up that late
138,2020-02-05 12:14:37,eyu553,"I really dont see the depth at CB. Rhodes will most likely be cut (and I hope we do so) Waynes is a FA and Alexander is a FA. So our only notable players left are Hughes and Holton Hill. One has a problem with injuries and the other with ""substances"". In my eyes there is a big ? at CB. At Safety we could either resign Harris (great but expensive) or just go with the HumanTorpedo again, Dejo wouldnt be the best option but he knows the team and was an okayish guy the last years.

For DT i really think we need someone who is able to pressure the opposing QB more, Linval is great against the run but lacks QBpressure in my eyes.

I'm not saying we shouldnt get a Safety during the draft or FA but I dont think we should spend a first round pick on it."
139,2020-02-05 00:41:11,eyu553,"I mean if this is how the board ran I’d hope we either went top rb or trade down. Honestly though, I doubt 6 receivers are going to go by us. Past few years haven’t shown teams are going to go that nuts on them. And the 2017 class really tilted takin one top 10."
140,2020-02-05 00:54:09,eyu553,"I wouldn't reach for a RB as that's not a high need, I'd def go BPA though, regardless of position except maybe QB or DT"

Rob Van Dam: That was just a freak thing. I was just a fan in the crowd, like 15-16 years old. It was a non-televised show… and they were doing a televised segment. I knew Ted DiBiase was there filming and I knew it was gonna make it on TV, so we were excited about that.

Me & my buddy… we rushed out to the gate in the front row. He was looking for a volunteer and as soon as he pointed in my direction, I just jumped over the gate and just ran in. I was so excited. I was so excited I forgot to negotiate. That was the whole gimmick. He offered me $100 to kiss his foot and I’d seen the TV show. I could have said no until he got up to $500, but I was so excited, I sucked his toes. I gave him a boot shine. I started taking Virgil’s boot off. He said, ""Get out of here, kid.""

Every deadline needs a Knicks-level laughingstock, and the pre-Ballmer Clips were just the team to provide it. In order to generate cap flexibility, the Clippers sent Baron Davis to Cleveland for Mo Williams and Jamario Moon. This wasn’t a bad decision in itself. However, as a sweetener, they threw in an unprotected pick that would become first overall. Instead of adding Kyrie Irving to a young core of Blake Griffin, Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe, DeAndre Jordan and Al-Farouq Aminu, the Clippers acquired Chris Paul in November and the Lob City era began. Throwing a protection on that pick – that’s a what if.

Oh god... such a pointless move."

182,2020-02-03 22:31:18,eyeo6j,"Nice work doing a 5-rounder, man!  I'd be stoked to bring home Jeudy/Queen in the first."
183,2020-02-03 23:36:52,eyeo6j,"Fan of this for the Vikings. While we don’t need a WR IMO, taking Hill in the 4th doesn’t upset me. Plus, you addressed our 3 biggest needs in the first 3 rounds (and in order too)."
184,2020-02-03 22:41:29,eyeo6j,I will be so disappointed if the Falcons take Chaisson. He's literally the same type of edge rusher that they always pick that never have any meaningful impact. Give me Epenesa all day. At least he can contribute from anywhere on the line
185,2020-02-03 23:07:03,eyeo6j,Fulton at 15 is not happening. Dude cant tackle which is a huge No No for vic Fangio’s defense.
186,2020-02-03 21:58:15,eyeo6j,Love this as a jets fan. First 3 rounds addressed all major needs.
187,2020-02-03 22:55:11,eyeo6j,"As a Titans fan, this is great. I think Gross-Matos is a freaking steal at #29 at our biggest need. I believe Peart can develop quickly and start at RT by the end of the season. Some will dislike Fromm and I personally would be inclined to go elsewhere. But getting a season QB to backup an injury prone Ryan Tannehill and also potentially succeed him is great value in the late 3rd. 

Only thing is while I really like Albert O and R5 is great value, I think we wouldn't go that route. I think we have good pieces there right now. I think CB or another EDGE would make more sense. Tannehill does need more options, though, and if they have him graded highly I could see them making that pick."
188,2020-02-04 00:38:00,eyeo6j,"I think this is a pretty solid draft for the Raiders all around. However, it does pain me that we didn't use one of those 3rds on a RB like Edwards-Helaire or Moss, who I really think could take our offense to another level."
189,2020-02-04 02:58:19,eyeo6j,I really cant get behind Klavon over Epensa for Atlanta.
190,2020-02-03 22:13:42,eyeo6j,"Actually makes sense for us.

There’s like an 80% chance we draft a DB round 1.

1. Lattimore and Janoris Jenkins are the only outside corners under contract BUT Jenkins could be cut(saving us $11.25 million) to help us retain S Vonn Bell.

2. If we keep Jenkins Vonn Bell is probably gone in which case we need a S.

Also having watched our defense get carved up by Goff, Garoppolo, Cousins in big games anyone saying the secondary isn’t as big a priority as receiver hasn’t watched us."
191,2020-02-03 22:30:29,eyeo6j,"If you’re a redskins fan, you’re blamming in all your favorite pants right now"
192,2020-02-03 21:59:38,eyeo6j,"This is one of the better mocks for the Seahawks imo.

I'd be pissed if they passed on Yetur Gross-Matos, but that's exactly what they've been doing for years.

I remember loving Chandler Jones in 2012 only for them to draft Bruce Irvin instead. Yes, I'm still salty about that."
193,2020-02-03 22:19:43,eyeo6j,As a Bengals fan this is near best case scenario
194,2020-02-04 00:56:05,eyeo6j,I’m really into the Jets draft.
195,2020-02-04 01:06:56,eyeo6j,What are people projecting Raekwon Davis to play in the NFL? I feel like I’ve seen anywhere from 4-3 1T to 3-4 5T
196,2020-02-04 01:11:36,eyeo6j,"Appreciate the effort you put in for this mock. I definitely think that the Bears are a likely landing spot for Gordon. One quick note, in the mock you have us taking Bryant, but under the team draft tab you have Kmet"
197,2020-02-04 01:33:43,eyeo6j,"This would be such a great draft for us personally. We address Edge, OL, and get a great slot guy who happens to run excellent routes (Jefferson).

Great work on this! I know it's a pipe dream, but man would it be cool as an LSU and Seahawks fan to get Justin Jefferson and pair him with Lockett and DK."
198,2020-02-04 02:57:21,eyeo6j,Not a huge fan of Uche. We don't really need a SAM/LEO hybrid but rather a full time LEO like YGM or Okwara.
199,2020-02-03 22:56:53,eyeo6j,"If Epenesa can play with a hand off the ground he could actually be filling a massive need. If not we'd need to do some shuffling in the front 7 as the roster currently seems biased toward a 3-4 base for the immediate future.  
  
Overall I like our draft. I think you hit the biggest needs and while I don't expect Epenesa or Hopkins to fall to those spots, if they did I'd love to get them."
200,2020-02-03 23:28:45,eyeo6j,"There are a few picks I would have made differently for the Ravens (in particular, Bredeson/Lemieux/DPJ/Pittman over Van Jefferson) but if this was our actual draft I'd be pretty happy with it."
201,2020-02-04 01:56:52,eyeo6j,"Those look like some respectable Panthers picks.  I do think we're probably going to grab and LB in one of the first 5 rounds, though.  I'm pulling for Simmons at #7, but Brown is also a good choice."
202,2020-02-04 02:04:15,eyeo6j,The Browns IOL is pretty well set. If we're picking there I'd like to see Trey Adams in the third. Liked the other picks but don't know much about Dugger
203,2020-02-04 02:07:32,eyeo6j,Pretty good draft for the Eagles in the later rounds. I don't see Ruggs falling to them though.
204,2020-02-04 02:15:53,eyeo6j,"I'm a Bengals fan. The only nitpick I have is round 4 I'd much rather have Stenberg, Woodward or Quarterman (in addition to Dye). But that's just my opinion. Otherwise I think you have a really good grasp on how the Bengals should be approaching this draft and what they need.

How do you research all the teams? Many people seem happy with what you've selected for them. That's crazy. I find it difficult enough to zero in on what the Bengals alone should be doing and I feel like I have a pretty good grip on the franchise."
205,2020-02-04 02:27:44,eyeo6j,The Chiefs waiting until the 5th round to select a CB would be a huge mistake. We only have 2 CBs under contract going into next year and probably won’t have the cap space to commit to veterans unless they let Chris Jones walk. Also the Chiefs have pick 63 not 64
206,2020-02-04 02:31:44,eyeo6j,Definitely solid for the Raiders
207,2020-02-04 03:12:48,eyeo6j,"Great dedication to do 5 rounds here.

Round 1 and 2 are ok mostly because of how the board fell ( I lean LSU over Bama but idc at this point, they need someone in the backyard), but that's about it. For the Cowboys, I feel like it's about time to see what our TE's can do. 

R3 for me is either Fotu or Elliot IDL
R4 is KJ Hill gimmie or if you really want to go TE here Bryant from FAU

We love giving up our 5th for some reason so then you have flexibility.

Again, great job on doing 5 rounds, real proud g"
208,2020-02-04 03:55:46,eyeo6j,"Great draft for the Vikings. Stud CB and Stefon's brother in Trevon, solid BIG10 receiver with potential, and one of the best IOL in the draft. Even if I'm not super thrilled about the Madubuike pick (he's a good run defender but doesn't get much pop off the LOS and we need a pass rushing 3-Tech), I can get down with this."
209,2020-02-04 04:00:56,eyeo6j,"I think the Steelers have an earlier pick in the 4th, it came out that they would not be getting the dolphins TEN pick, they would be getting the dolphins pick"
210,2020-02-04 04:31:30,eyeo6j,"First three picks for the Lions were great but I don’t think we go RB in the fourth. Kerryon is the guy if he can stay healthy, Bo looked more than serviceable & is a solid backup, & Ty Johnson is not great but doable for a third back. I think we end up bringing in some undrafted guys to compete & we instead slide in a slot wr there, or go iOL there & a wr in the fifth. Nonetheless thank you for the effort you put in to this mock."
211,2020-02-04 04:50:16,eyeo6j,"Good mock, but Seattle owns KC's second round pick, not SF's"
212,2020-02-04 04:59:10,eyeo6j,Any reason you've got bryce hopkins rated so low?
213,2020-02-04 05:00:35,eyeo6j,"Overall, this is a very believable mock draft. There is a few things that I find hard to believe, like Curtis Weaver falling to the 3rd round; however, it’s easy to nitpick anything. Also as a Cardinals fan, I love the Blacklock pick, but I rather take Jeudy over Lamb."
214,2020-02-04 05:30:56,eyeo6j,"You hit the Eagles needs pretty well. We get our speed (firmly in the give me Ruggs or give me death camp myself), corner help, safety help, another big body type WR, iDL. Well done mate!"
215,2020-02-04 05:36:47,eyeo6j,Really like this for Minnesota
216,2020-02-04 07:00:46,eyeo6j,"Bears win.

Huge fan of Gordon."
217,2020-02-04 10:08:17,eyeo6j,Great work man.
218,2020-02-04 12:21:01,eyeo6j,I have no confidence when it comes to NY drafting a successful OL.
219,2020-02-04 14:41:33,eyeo6j,"Not going to lie, if we passed on Isiah Wilson in the 3rd, I'd be pretty pissed."
220,2020-02-04 17:16:18,eyeo6j,YES ADAM TRAUTMAN! I am trying to will the Browns into drafting him.
221,2020-02-04 20:17:49,eyeo6j,"I don’t see the dolphins going RB in the first round. Feel like they’ll go full QB, protect QB and get after other teams QB in first round."
222,2020-02-06 00:40:20,eyeo6j,"Dude, I'd shit a brick if the draft went this way for the Colts"
223,2020-02-03 22:06:48,eyeo6j,"Just FYI, Cleveland owns pick 90 (Houston’s 3rd round pick) from the Duke Johnson trade"
224,2020-02-03 22:54:33,eyeo6j,This is beautiful for the chargers
225,2020-02-04 02:23:43,eyeo6j,Why Hamler over Higgins for GB at 1.30?
226,2020-02-03 22:33:55,eyeo6j,"Not gonna lie, I was trying to get all 7 rounds done but my brain gave out even though I started last week."
227,2020-02-03 23:38:02,eyeo6j,"Happy to hear it! 

With this WR class I don’t see the harm in grabbing someone in the mid rounds who can help in a bunch of ways."
228,2020-02-04 11:48:41,eyeo6j,Chaisson is a damn good run defender not just a speed pass rusher. You’d be well off with either.
229,2020-02-08 06:58:49,eyeo6j,Man for real. Our defense is undersized why add another undersized edge player when you can throw a 6-6 280 pound player at edge or slide him inside to DT.
230,2020-02-03 22:43:00,eyeo6j,That’s fair. I like both a lot but figured Chaisson fit what they like while providing a higher floor since he won’t be a liability against the run.
231,2020-02-03 23:22:03,eyeo6j,"I think that’s underselling Fulton’s tackling but I won’t disagree that’s a weakness to his game. I don’t see him being prohibitive in his physicality to the point in which you wouldn’t take him, tbh."
232,2020-02-03 22:11:56,eyeo6j,Glad to hear it!
233,2020-02-05 00:13:21,eyeo6j,"Very much agreed. Wirfs +1



Dunno anything about Aiyuk, draftnetwork says more of YAC guy than a contested catches guy. Not sure if thats a + or - for us. Does say he can block though which considering how comedically bad our WRs are at blocking for screens sounds really nice."
234,2020-02-03 23:16:57,eyeo6j,Appreciate the comments. Stuff I’ll keep in mind for next time!
235,2020-02-04 00:39:50,eyeo6j,For the usage I think it would make more sense to target Perine on day 3 over one of those players on day 2. I can see the merits of either method nonetheless
236,2020-02-04 03:01:15,eyeo6j,"That seems to be the feedback from ATL, though I think Chaisson is in a similar tier to Epenesa with higher upside as a pass rusher. Love them both though."
237,2020-02-03 22:17:07,eyeo6j,Appreciate that!
238,2020-02-04 00:58:27,eyeo6j,Yeah would be really happy with this. Would be nice to get KJ Hill at the top of the 4th but all things considered this would be great.
239,2020-02-03 22:34:24,eyeo6j,What happens if you aren’t wearing your favorite pants?
240,2020-02-03 22:11:47,eyeo6j,Mocking for Seattle is difficult cause they don’t often do what’s expected or what they should do.
241,2020-02-03 22:55:30,eyeo6j," Idk i think it worked out great.  Hell, chandler even gave Russ 4 hugs last time they saw each other!"
242,2020-02-04 03:00:04,eyeo6j,"I don't see it. We need someone who is a full-time LEO, and we need one ASAP. Uche is better suited to play SAM, which isn't much of a need. I think YGM is a better pick, as he has the athleticism and the size to play LEO."
243,2020-02-03 22:42:42,eyeo6j,"If the board fell like this, I would love for them to trade back into the 2nd round and pick up Justin Jefferson for Burrow. But with no trades in this mock I agree, very good"
244,2020-02-03 22:25:37,eyeo6j,👍🏻
245,2020-02-04 00:56:40,eyeo6j,🙌🏻
246,2020-02-04 01:15:04,eyeo6j,I think he’s rather scheme versatile. He’s a strong 2 gapping DT with some pass rush upside if he can get better leverage and hand usage.
247,2020-02-04 01:13:20,eyeo6j,Good catch! Thanks.
248,2020-02-04 01:35:34,eyeo6j,Jefferson falling to y’all ended up working out and is one of my favorite fits tbh.
249,2020-02-04 02:59:33,eyeo6j,That makes sense. I have similar grades on YGM and Uche and don’t think the added versatility is a negative but I can see your concern there.
250,2020-02-03 23:55:43,eyeo6j,At 6'6 280 I think Epenesa has plenty of size to play a 3-4 DE
251,2020-02-03 23:19:17,eyeo6j,I think it’d be a lot to ask Epenesa play standing up but sometimes the talent makes it worth shuffling.
252,2020-02-03 23:33:06,eyeo6j,"I agree that some of the WRs there might have higher ceilings than Van but Van is going to have a great year 1 and for a team in the super bowl hunt that should be pretty valuable, imo."
253,2020-02-04 05:26:10,eyeo6j,I think I would rather have van over Pittman as far as receivers go. Think boykin can develop into a bigger jump ball type of threat I also think Lamar tends to not throw too many jump balls in general and trusts receivers that separate routinely which is why I think he went to Hollywood and mark Andrews so much because they were the best separators on the team. The only thing I would say that I would have changed was taking a running back when they’ll have 4 coming back next year that they like would rather have a safety or a CB that can play special teams immediately.
254,2020-02-04 01:57:36,eyeo6j,Yeah those were the two I was deciding between but I like Brown a little bit more.
255,2020-02-04 02:55:47,eyeo6j,"That’s fair, the team needs sheet showed OG as a need but I can see an OT double dip for y’all."
256,2020-02-04 03:43:25,eyeo6j,Winfield at Safety. Speak it into existence.
257,2020-02-04 02:15:22,eyeo6j,Crazier things have happened though.
258,2020-02-04 02:37:47,eyeo6j,"Thanks! I used a mix of Apache’s team needs sheet, a dive into team subreddits/blogs, and spotrac for contract situations."
259,2020-02-04 02:42:17,eyeo6j,"Forgot to switch the picks over so thanks for the catch. 

I wanted to go CB earlier but never liked the value as much. Next time will hopefully go a bit different there."
260,2020-02-04 02:40:36,eyeo6j,💪🏻
261,2020-02-04 03:15:30,eyeo6j,Appreciate it. I’ll keep that stuff in mind for next time.
262,2020-02-04 04:01:49,eyeo6j,🤘🏻
263,2020-02-04 04:02:24,eyeo6j,I didn’t see anything on Tankathon but that stuff is starting to come out now.
264,2020-02-04 12:05:21,eyeo6j,That was just a mix of the team needs sheet showing RB as a need and Moss being pretty much the BPA
265,2020-02-04 12:04:04,eyeo6j,Yeah I have to adjust that thanks
266,2020-02-04 12:07:43,eyeo6j,Handsome blocking worry me a bit.
267,2020-02-04 12:10:42,eyeo6j,"True, every draft though guys fall for dumb reasons. Not hard to imagine Weaver not testing great and dropping a little. 

I debated between those two but having chemistry between Murray and Lamb helps break the tie between two prospects I rate very similarly."
268,2020-02-04 12:14:42,eyeo6j,🤙🏻
269,2020-02-04 12:16:59,eyeo6j,Thanks!
270,2020-02-04 12:17:08,eyeo6j,Glad to hear it!
271,2020-02-04 12:17:44,eyeo6j,🤟🏻
272,2020-02-04 12:22:15,eyeo6j,That’s how I feel about the Raiders and LBs so I get the feeling.
273,2020-02-04 15:17:17,eyeo6j,Sorry 🤷🏻‍♂️
274,2020-02-04 17:19:27,eyeo6j,👊🏻
275,2020-02-04 20:53:49,eyeo6j,Certainly possible
276,2020-02-06 00:41:18,eyeo6j,Good or bad brick?
277,2020-02-03 22:10:43,eyeo6j,I saw on OTC that was the case unless Houston was awarded a comp pick in which case y’all get that one instead.
278,2020-02-03 23:15:54,eyeo6j,I didn’t want to help too much but I can be kind.
279,2020-02-04 02:40:22,eyeo6j,"Simply, I just like Hamler more and think he has a higher ceiling as an explosive threat. GB has a bunch of bigger receivers but no one with Hamler’s skill set imo"
280,2020-02-03 22:50:44,eyeo6j,Looking forward to seeing more of your stuff!  I'll be hopping in the WR for some of the community mocks on Discord so seeing mocks like this gets me stoked for the draft season.
281,2020-02-03 23:22:52,eyeo6j,"I absolutely do, especially with ruggs on the board, who our FO is reportedly pretty high on."
282,2020-02-03 23:52:20,eyeo6j,Agreed. Would sign up for this in a NY minute
283,2020-02-08 07:02:21,eyeo6j,"Size for me is the biggest thing, our defense is undersized every year, would be really nice to throw a big strong player on the line who can defend the run and rush the passer while also freeing up the LBs more than a slender player like Chaisson."
284,2020-02-04 03:00:45,eyeo6j,I just think Uche is better suited to play SAM and he doesn't have the size to play LEO full-time.
285,2020-02-04 17:03:26,eyeo6j,"Yeah I'd think so, but in that event I don't believe we'd be using him optimally. My read on him is not very strong, to be fair, as I just haven't really thought he'd ever reach us so I haven't looked into the fit. We ask our 3-techs to 2-gap quite a bit and my understanding is that while Epenesa is still stout against the run, his specialty is in the pass rush. A 3DL lineup of Guy, Simon and Epenesa could be pretty solid though. I'd be thrilled if we could follow that pick up with someone like Kenny Willekes in the 3rd."
286,2020-02-04 03:17:29,eyeo6j,"OG isn't wrong, I just think between Teller and Forbes we have a RG that can do the job. Our tackles on both sides are worrisome so if we draft a project in the third I'm imagining we'd sign a 2 year starter. 

Like your mock for everyone. That's not the easiest"
287,2020-02-04 04:58:27,eyeo6j,Honestly I want to keep Randall. Redwine came on last season well. Lots of safety in the FA....
288,2020-02-04 02:42:12,eyeo6j,I think I’d actually prefer to take Kinlaw and double dip at WR in the 3rd. But either way I’m happy
289,2020-02-04 05:13:58,eyeo6j,Yea I was thinking Jordan Elliot at that spot. OP insight on why you have him as 4th round?
290,2020-02-04 12:14:19,eyeo6j,Is his threat as a receiver enough to see him go higher?
291,2020-02-04 15:22:03,eyeo6j,You should be.  Now go to your room!
292,2020-02-06 00:53:05,eyeo6j,A **great** brick. That's literally my perfect draft. Love and Gallimore are 2 big gets and Higgins is just the cherry on top
293,2020-02-04 09:04:10,eyeo6j,"Just so you know, Hamler isn't the type of WR that GB typically drafts. I honestly can't remember the last time we picked a smaller, shifty guy with ""fuck you"" speed (the closest to that being Cobb, but he wasn't all that fast). Maybe that changes with LaFleur at Head Coach, but I think the main motivation behind it is that the Front Office likes bigger-bodied guys with sure hands who can still perform in Lambeau after the weather turns."
294,2020-02-03 22:52:23,eyeo6j,"I’ll try for a full 7 rounds post combine. Can’t wait for the community mocks, tons of ways the draft can shake out for us."
295,2020-02-03 23:24:17,eyeo6j,Agree to disagree then. I think Fulton is a better prospect at a more valuable position than Ruggs. Next mock I might go in a different direction based on what’s reported but we shall see.
296,2020-02-04 00:41:52,eyeo6j,"Would be fucking amazing is Tyler B slips to us in the 3rd.  

Would be hard to pass on curtis weaver who also slipped tho"
297,2020-02-04 03:03:36,eyeo6j,"I think he does personally, he’s clearly athletic enough and has the length Carroll likes from the position."
298,2020-02-04 17:57:31,eyeo6j,Chandler Jones is best as a pass rusher and he performed quite well here in the same position. I dont think BB is just going to plop guys into a role that they won't do well in.
299,2020-02-04 03:21:34,eyeo6j,Thanks!
300,2020-02-04 02:49:58,eyeo6j,"I would disagree because I think we have some solid depth receivers who were asked to do too much. We need a true #1 target outside of Waller for whomever is QBing next year. We run so much with multiple TEs I don’t see the value of double dipping on 3rd round WRs personally. 

I would love for Marinelli to get his hands on Kinlaw though. We could definitely use a difference maker on the interior."
301,2020-02-04 12:14:05,eyeo6j,"Don’t love his lack of length, hand strength or hand usage personally. I think Madubuike is a better prospect who still fills a need of a 3T penetration player, tbh."
302,2020-02-04 12:16:46,eyeo6j,I mean it’s possible sure. We all know that mock drafts are a massive undertaking in guesswork. He could go early in the 2nd as TE1 or slip to the 3rd. All it takes is one team to draft him.
303,2020-02-04 15:23:29,eyeo6j,Excuse me but my wife is the only person ordering me to my room now. I mean our room. Please don’t look at this honey....
304,2020-02-06 00:56:25,eyeo6j,👌🏻
305,2020-02-04 12:19:51,eyeo6j,"I don’t disagree with what the team has done, just that it leaves you missing that explosive element on offense. Is it possible they like Higgins more cause he’s another big body like all the other receivers with a bit more juice? Sure is, I just think he adds a plus version of players you already have and diversity is the spice of life."
306,2020-02-04 18:16:50,eyeo6j,"Jones was, yes, but we were running a 4 man base front when he was here and while he did do quite well here, he's been even better in Arizona as a standup edge with more freedom to pass rush and fewer run stopping responsibilities. Whenever we've ran 3 man base fronts under Belichick we've had the 3-techs primarily 2-gap. It's not that that *can't* be adjusted, but Belichick has never run a 1-gap penetrating scheme, which would be a better fit for Epenesa's skill set than asking him to be a space eating 2-gapper.   
  
It's not an insurmountable barrier to drafting Epenesa, and if he falls to us and the talent wins out and we do take him I will be happy with the pick, it's just a trickier fit than someone like Yetur Gross-Matos."

317,2020-02-02 07:14:26,exkoou,Glad I didn't stay up for this one. Ugh.
318,2020-02-02 17:17:23,exkoou,The only thing worse than losing to the oilers is being embarrassed by the oilers. Lost on the scoreboard. Lost in fights. Lost the chirp battles. Kassian scored. Rittich got embarrassed. Just bad all over.
319,2020-02-02 22:41:23,exkoou,Hey I've been searching why didn't rittich answer questions after the game? Be careful with karma  look where Bautista is now

It felt good to win the game and win the fights. You would have felt the same way if it was reversed."

I was on the train leaving a game one time. Couple guys, one in a Flames jersey and one in an Oilers jersey, where chirping each other as the made their way to the train. Chirping got louder as they entered their respective trains accross the platform from each other.

Before the doors closed, they both jumped out and fought in the middle of the platform. Doors  closed and left them their with Peace Officers.

Good times."
327,2020-02-02 08:50:50,exkoou,Besides us not showing up it was still the most entertaining loss all season tbh
328,2020-02-02 21:40:11,exkoou,Rittich got what he deserved after that ridiculous stick flip in The shoot out last game. Disrespecting the opponent in a game that was that close and acting like he won the cup with that save kind of speaks volumes on player character
329,2020-02-02 22:03:14,exkoou,"Must be one of those monkey paw situations.

""I wish for absolute chaos in the battle of Alberta"""
330,2020-02-02 15:54:52,exkoou,Rinaldo maybe helps win a fight but he doesn’t help win that game. I do think that Ward just doesn’t have his team focused. The game went from 4-1 to 4-3 they had 100% of the momentum and then a couple barn shitter shifts in a row they give it all way. Kylington should sit next game and Hanifin should be tossed off the PK.
331,2020-02-02 22:40:58,exkoou,Ward’s lineup decisions are somewhat questionable. I agree Rinaldo should be getting in there more often. He brings more to the game than Rieder on most nights. Plus Rinaldo and Bennett with someone like Backlund or Ryan at center seems to make a good energy line.
332,2020-02-02 22:43:46,exkoou,He can call next from his well worn spot on the bench haha it makes no difference if he dresses or not he is the definition a non factor in the game
333,2020-02-03 19:48:44,exkoou,"Couldn’t agree more. Flames won the season series in the first three...and promptly decided they were done playing hockey against the oilers. IMO Oilers fans aren’t celebrating a win, they’re celebrating a complete and total beat down in every conceivable category. This one game has made Flames fans question everything. Their coach, players, defence you name it. 

As a Flames fan I can only hope that our team shows up huge on April 4th and rights the ship here."
334,2020-02-02 18:18:00,exkoou,I'm saying a lot of Oiler fans acting like this one won them everything. I'm fine with Oiler fans being excited about winning but a lot are acting like they won the cup. Cant even chirp an Oiler fan without them saying 8-3 like every other game didnt matter at all. It was a good old hockey game even though Calgary decided to play like an AHL team. I know you guys went up 2 points on us but still remember that we play in the Pacific even after the Tkachuk game I knew we weren't staying up there
335,2020-02-02 23:05:38,exkoou,"Lol, imagine bragging about cups that were won 30 years ago."
336,2020-02-03 00:04:29,exkoou,Even when you beat us in a blow out you still have to live in the past huh?
337,2020-02-02 19:13:37,exkoou,Isn’t the rivalry between Montreal and Ottawa? Maybe proximity?
338,2020-02-02 21:51:21,exkoou,Relevant username...
339,2020-02-03 19:52:16,exkoou,Gotta love Oilers fans pretending they wouldn’t have loved the shit out of this if it was Smitty flipping the bat.
340,2020-02-02 16:16:26,exkoou,"He would’ve helped much more than Dube or Lucic. I’ve been impressed by Rinaldo on our 4th line. The guy shows up to play.

The game would’ve been much different if someone would’ve chased Kassian around the ice after their quick 2 goals. The guy still needs to answer the bell for the rag dolling. Do we really need Tkachuk fighting everyone on the Oilers?"
341,2020-02-03 20:33:38,exkoou,"Regardless, I think we can all agree that the BoA has been reignited in the best of ways. The parity, rivalry, and competitiveness is what I've wanted to see my whole life. I can't wait for the next game.  
However, I must say that I'm not sure my heart could handle a playoff series against you guys."
342,2020-02-02 18:39:13,exkoou,"> a lot are acting like they won the cup  


You sound bitter. Oilers fans are happy about winning a spicy game and you guys would be acting the same way. Like I said, if there was a single game in the last two decades I’d want to win, it was that one. Sure, we lost three BoA games this season but this one felt the biggest. Blowout score, Kassian scores, Bear smacks Tkachuk, Smith lays a beating on Talbot after swapping teams, Oilers take the lead in the standings, Yamamoto continues his dominance. There’s a lot of narratives here and reasons for Oiler fans to be happy."
343,2020-02-02 19:57:50,exkoou,Lol sounds like your mad cause you lost 8-3
344,2020-02-02 22:37:18,exkoou,And he's a butt hurt oily fuck
345,2020-02-02 22:45:09,exkoou,Hey only problem with your logic is tkachuk picks kassian not the other way around
346,2020-02-03 22:08:45,exkoou,"Haha completely agree! I was born in 91, so other than highlight packages I sadly missed out on the hay day of the BoA. It feels good to have it actually mean something. That being said a playoff matchup would probably take years off my life lol."
347,2020-02-02 19:27:47,exkoou,"Of course I'm salty my team was embarrassed last night. How did you feel when Calgary embarrassed Edmonton 5-1 in their own arena? I'm saying all the Oil fans acting like nothing else matters just this, this proves Edmonton is miles ahead of Calgary already is ridiculous it's one game in the pacific division you get one win then you lose the next one and you fall down the standings. This division is ass if Calgary gets their shit together for the next game their right back up those 2 points next to you."
348,2020-02-02 20:53:06,exkoou,That would be a correct statement I am mad at my team yes
349,2020-02-02 20:15:51,exkoou,Member when the Flames beat the Oilers 5-1 in your barn? I remember. How salty were Oilers fans then?
350,2020-02-02 23:18:16,exkoou,"Butt hurt? All I did was point out a fact that a large part of your fan base knows, being unsportsmanlike and disrespecting the other team has consequences. MT did it to Zack and now Rittich, I personally would like to thank both them players for firing up the Oilers! The battle of Alberta is back!!"
351,2020-02-02 20:34:10,exkoou,"I’m aware of how standings work.  

> I'm saying all the Oil fans acting like nothing else matters just this  

No one is saying “nothing else matters”, you are. We are just celebrating that in this particular moment our team took the standings over our rival in a spicy game. You’re the one interpreting it like a bitter child."
352,2020-02-02 20:42:14,exkoou,I'm guessing I'm just finding the worst of the crop

370,2020-02-02 05:38:34,execxn,"What do you guys think about Love The Way You Lie? When I first sort of passively listened to it, I thought ""damn, this might literally be the most grossly insensitive thing I've ever heard"". The second time I listened and paid a bit more attention I was like ""okay, maybe there's *some* mature presentation of violent relationships"", and by the third time I listened I was very conflicted. Like, the Rihanna part sounds great, and lyrically works pretty well, explaining the almost stockholm-syndromey nature of a lot of violent relationships and apologism for one's abuser in an intelligent and understandable way. The Eminem parts... Ehhhhhh. I think he does a good job in the second verse of presenting the dude he’s portraying as a total psycho asshole, yet in a somewhat sympathetic light to avoid the black and white presentation you see in a lot of media. Abusers aren't necessarily evil villains from a cartoon, they're often just normal looking people, which is why it can be so hard to spot. But then he says shit like this in the final verse:

> If she ever tries to fucking leave again, I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

I mean, I *get* that he's portraying a bad person, and it's important to beef that fact up in the final verse or else I think the song would sound too apologetic towards Eminem’s character, but jesus, did we really need to devolve into the violence porn at the end? It's like when TV shows or movies show violent rape scenes or kids viscerally committing suicide in media aimed at teenagers. It's not an *endorsement*, necessarily, but when you consider Eminem's audience, it feels pretty glamourised. People *like* it when Eminem gets angry and gross and violent, so regardless of his intentions, it still feels immature, in the same way that the media reporting on names of school shooters encourages more school shooters, even though it's actively condemned. I wanna know how other people think about this song."

406,2020-02-23 06:12:12,execxn,"I know this is old but I was just browsing the rate and saw this. It faded from the public mind very quick for such a controversial superstar moment. Rihanna was only one year removed from Chris Brown's abuse when it dropped and people did NOT take kindly to her singing ""I like the way it hurts"". She had a lot of people making memes saying she enjoyed Chris's abuse or didn't care etc. and it didn't help that she did initially take him back then would take him back again briefly about 3 years later. 

Eminem's abuse has been well documented by himself, both in having an abusive mother, absent father and being violent toward his ex-wife Kim. So it's definitely interesting and compelling to see two people on the opposite sides of the issue come together like this and examine what they've experienced first hand. 

Sometimes I think certain pieces of media are too complex or layered for mainstream audiences. Artists are people who seek answers through their own artistic expression and use music to figure out how they feel about something. No one can tell Rihanna (and to a lesser extent) Eminem how they should go about handling a song that depicts something so personally lived-in. This is what Rihanna wanted to do at this point in her life and career so she obviously felt it reflected her state of mind. Eminem too (I'm treating him as a secondary because he was the violent one in this case so it's decidedly less important what he thinks even though I guess it is somewhat vital to understand how abusers think about their partner)."

I think we end up tagging Judon and letting Pierce walk. BWill has proven to be much more vital to our success. After that I’m sure we go the bargain route to fill a lot of spots and then turn to the draft"

Sure, if there’s a great one we like I could see an addition but that’s usually a late/mid round thing.  We can use a talented edge player especially if he can move around, rush inside, cause confusion. I’ve heard Curtis Weaver described in these terms.  ILB wouldn’t be a surprise at all. JH said he’d like Onwuasor back but I don’t see why he would want to return. I agree that Judon and Jimmy likely walk but we value having a great DB group so much; don’t be surprised if we continue to invest there despite a lack of obvious need. We can always use WRs that can separate and IOL depth.

I’d love to keep Pierce, even if it costs us BWill. But that doesn’t seem like the way things are headed."

485,2020-02-01 13:13:38,ex2yis,"I agree that overpaying to keep Robby would be a huge mistake, especially if it comes at the expense of Jam's extension, but I gotta ask:

Who are these ""well run teams"" you're referring to?

The Pats? Because they just wasted a bunch of money on bad (re stupid) bets on guys like Antonio Brown and Josh Gordon, robbing Brady and co of top end WR talent that they sorely needed in the end.

The Steelers? Because their recent WR history is almost as bad as New England's. 

The Giants? Lol.

The Chiefs? I mean I guess I can see it, provided that this situation brewing with Sammy Watkins doesn't deteriorate. In fact if Watkins does sit 2020 out and is cut Robby could theoretically wind up as his replacement. That's a stretch though.

The 49ers? This one is interesting, because Robbie would be a younger and faster replacement for the almost certainly departing Emmanuel Sanders. The Niners aren't exactly flush with cap space, but Robbie winding up in SF is very plausible.

I mean I guess I *kind of* get what you're saying, that hypothetically a team with a smart and pragmatic front office would be shrewd with him. And in the end I agree with that.

But like anything in life, shit just isn't that simple."
486,2020-02-01 08:26:59,ex2yis,"Offer 11m annual. Let him walk if he doesn't take it. 

I like Robby. But I'm fine letting him go and banking on getting another deep threat. He's not Julio Jones."
487,2020-02-01 17:40:45,ex2yis,"Now you say Wentz got over 4k yards.. but Eagles fans have been lamenting their god awful WR core for the entire year. Blaming entire games on them, which with their drops is probably true."
488,2020-02-01 20:25:24,ex2yis,"The league overpays for WRs - look at the $$ Alshon is getting in Philly, or Allen Robinson in Chicago.


Someone is going to pay Robby north of $10M a year. I don’t think it should be us because our O-Line has to be the #1 priority. Protect Sam, he’ll make the throws."
489,2020-02-01 16:45:29,ex2yis,"I would rather pay RA $10mil than take a gamble on an unknown and have plenty of unused cap space. He also would not be my first priority, more of a why not if we have the cash"
490,2020-02-01 17:41:09,ex2yis,Yea sure lets make one of our weakest position groups even weaker so we can penny pinch even though we can easily afford him
491,2020-02-01 19:53:58,ex2yis,">Vyncint Smith

Sure, lets have a guy whose played 20 games (with 5 starts) recoup the loss of our best receiver. This isn't a solution, it's a band aid and not a good one at that. 

>someone through the draft

So with our draft capital at a premium this season, we're going to use a pick to try and recoup the value of a player we have the cap space to keep? Even if we keep Robby we will still almost definitely be trying to nab a true WR 1 in the draft, which will already be hard since our more valuable draft capital will likely go to top heavy positions in the draft like OL and edge. 

Letting Robby walk would turn our situation at WR from bad to worse when we are already desperate to put talent around Darnold. 

 The Jets are going into the season with ~$56 million in cap. We could sign Robby for 12 Million, front-load half of it in 2020, and still have 50 Million to sign free agents. That's enough to bring on a top OT, a top edge piece, and still retain most of our other decent free agents.

>a cheaper free agent

[Here](https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/free-agents/all/wide-receiver/) is every available free agent WR in 2020. Show me someone there you could get for less than 4 years/$3 million who has a reasonable chance of matching Robby's production.

>Carson Wentz got over 4K yards throwing to guys like Deontay Burnett

He also had this receiver named Zach Ertz, maybe you heard of him. 88 receptions for 916 yards and 6 TDs? 

The Jets are 29th in overall offensive spending, and yet fans clutch their pearls when it comes time to pay any offensive free agent and then are shocked when we put out a bottom-5 offense year after year. 

""Well run"" teams understand that sometimes you have to pony up and pay an impeding free agent what they're owed. Things like team fit and chemistry (which are difficult-impossible to predict in an incoming free agent, see AB) are invaluable to building a strong offensive core and obviously Robby has that."
492,2020-02-01 20:25:16,ex2yis,"He's basically a burner.  He runs well in a straight line but his route running and cuts are poor in comparison to other good receivers.  Once his speed is gone, he'll be out of the league.

I'd love to keep him but not for $10m+/yr"
493,2020-02-01 12:50:11,ex2yis,"I stand by the fact that I firmly believe we can replace him with a 3rd-5th round pick, save a bunch of money and potential upgrade. There is zero need to pay this man that kind of money.

Not to mention, I 100% believe Sam can make mediocre players look really good. Get him a good o-line and the rest will take care of itself"
494,2020-02-02 15:20:51,ex2yis,"If any other team was well run they wouldn't have the Jets roster and wouldn't have the lack of WR depth that we have.

Every team is different. Context is different everywhere.

>  Robby is good but damn he couldn’t even get the ball against that Bills receiver covering him week 17

It wasn't even thrown his way, what the fuck are you talking about"
495,2020-02-01 16:00:37,ex2yis,"This years draft is crazy deep at WR. If we can keep Robby for around 10mil then no harm in signing but if he commands more than I agree, let him walk and draft a kid you like"
496,2020-02-01 16:54:07,ex2yis,We're not a well run team (as currently constructed - thanks Macc).  Talent poor and money rich teams should not jettison talent for money.
497,2020-02-01 20:09:50,ex2yis,He's not worth anything over $7 mil a year. I highly doubt that he'll find a team that will give him more and/or that he lives up to it.
498,2020-02-01 11:10:06,ex2yis,"Fine with letting RA walk. Yea to Adams, no to Thuney. Make a play for an OT, not an IOL. And if you don’t score Amari Cooper in FA, you gotta go Jeudy/Lamb in round one. After that, C-G-WR-G/T in that order."

500,2020-02-01 13:51:41,ex2yis,Robby is an 8mil a year WR.. offer him 10 or 11 because that's what the market dictates. If he balks then move on. Cut Quincy while we are at it.

502,2020-02-01 14:38:06,ex2yis,I love this response. Often time we are too critical of a bad team and overly praising a good team. No team is perfect and they all have flaws. Even Pat's have made many mistakes and we keep forgetting that.
503,2020-02-01 20:29:06,ex2yis,"This kind of mindset coming from OP drives me insane. It’s idiotic and incredibly shortsighted. Let’s let all out WRs walk because the Jets aren’t a good team but at the same time defend Gase cuz they ended up with 7 wins with an injury riddled team blah blah blah. While OP isn’t doing that in this post, I’ve seen it in this sub. 

Let’s build the wall! Because having a strong OL but no weapons for your QBs has really worked out... oh wait a minute no it fucking doesn’t. It doesn’t work for the cowboys. It doesn’t work for the eagles. When they won the Super Bowl Foles played out of his mind & they scored a ton of points with aggressive play calling & their offense actually producing. The jets need a better OL and they need receivers who get open. They need a guy like Robby Anderson who opens up the field. It’s like this guy forgets how bad the Jets offense was when they had guys like Jeremly Kerley & David Nelson as WR1s. 

Literally all you need to do is follow the right people on Twitter and you’ll see there are plays where Robby gets open but either: Darnold misses the throw, doesn’t look robby’s way, or doesn’t have enough time to get the ball to him. Is he on the level of Hopkins, Julio, OBJ? No. But he doesn’t need to be because no team has 4+ WR1s in their lineup. Oh, and you know what kind of receiver the Pats missed this year besides obviously a guy like Gronk? A WR who could stretch the field."

506,2020-02-01 21:18:06,ex2yis,There's oodles of FA that we could plausibly pursue. We aren't in a situation like the Colts were last season where they had no one to pay for so they were willing to overpay Funchess. We have a lot to work on and FA should be navigated with care.
507,2020-02-01 21:21:58,ex2yis,"...we have FA and the draft to replace him. This isn't July or August where we basically have no options, we have an entire offseason where we can make moves. Drafting a WR early and taking a later flyer on a good, small school WR later on will restock the position group as well as potentially have a higher ceiling. There's not much further to fall than what we've had lately lol"
508,2020-02-01 20:32:57,ex2yis,"Lol. Deontay Burnett. He caught three passes (2 during the regular season) for a total of 53 yards. While I like Burnett, this just shows how fucking stupid OP is.

Exactly.

We have a roster full of holes and OP wants us to create ANOTHER hole at a position of need that we could easily afford just for the sake of...what? Emulating other teams who do not have the roster problems that we have? It makes no fucking sense.

> The Jets are 29th in overall offensive spending, and yet fans clutch their pearls when it comes time to pay any offensive free agent and then are shocked when we put out a bottom-5 offense year after year.

Preach."
510,2020-02-01 21:39:49,ex2yis,"> Even if we keep Robby we will still almost definitely be trying to nab a true WR 1 in the draft, which will already be hard since our more valuable draft capital will likely go to top heavy positions in the draft like OL and edge.


While I don't think JD has it in him to take a first round WR, second and third round receivers often become very productive receivers and some of the best in the league have been taken in these rounds. RA was an UDFA and it shows—over the course of 62 games, he's averaged 49 yards a game and less than 1 TD every 3 games. His impact goes beyond stats, but those are VERY sorry stats for someone so many people feel obliged to pay. Drafting a genuinely strong prospect early on will set up at least one spot in the corps for the next several years. 

>  yet fans clutch their pearls when it comes time to pay any offensive free agent and then are shocked when we put out a bottom-5 offense year after year

Because we're horrible offensively even with the supposed talent of RA. Paying nearly $10mm more for him to continue to let us down isn't a no-brainer. Retooling the offense makes more sense when we have the resources to than doubling down hoping we can win in spite of worse contracts to meh players."
511,2020-02-01 20:20:28,ex2yis,People downvote anyone who doesn’t want to keep RA. Your point is great - why pay top dollar for an average WR? His stats speak for themselves.
512,2020-02-01 16:47:11,ex2yis,"I agree with the first part—people really overvalue the contribution RA gives the team. Granted I’d rather take someone in the first two rounds and not take a flyer on someone, but as a guy going into his fifth year, he has enough flaws in his game that you’d expect to be able to replace him with any effort towards drafting someone earlier on. When players like AJ Brown, Deebo, DK, and later on picks like Terry McLaurin and Darius Slayton can be plug and plays but we’re still trying to get a receiver during his fourth season to pull it together, we need to re-evaluate things. Granted that Darnold trade kinda cleaned us out from getting more starting talent that could’ve been on the line or a WR, but still. Now’s the time to look at things objectively


But no to the second part. He needs competent receivers that aren’t letting him down. We need players that are mediocre at the worst. No reason to do the “here’s a line and nothing else” game if we don’t have to"
513,2020-02-02 15:26:29,ex2yis,"> I firmly believe we can replace him with a 3rd-5th round pick, 

How many WRs have been drafted late by teams in the last few round that weren't as good as RA? Hell, we tried that with even Ardarius Stewart and Chad Hansen and look at what happened. Where the hell is this idea coming from?"

517,2020-02-01 21:15:45,ex2yis,"I'll be the first one to laugh at the obsessive ""Build the Wall"" mantra, but acting like RA is an irreplaceable talent and we're essentially obligated to resign him just to keep a body in the WR room is misguided. For every specially-curated playlist of ""RA wasn't the problem"" plays, there's countless plays we saw with our own eyes where RA failed on the play singlehandedly. 


We need an OL and he would benefit from a better line, but he's been extremely middling in his tenure and the fact we have FA and the draft ahead of us gives us an avenue to restock the position group if needed. Resigning RA makes WR less of a need, but hampers our ability to sign other FA's whether on our roster currently or signing new players. For every dollar we spend on RA, that's less to spend on the OL FA class that can give us greater flexibility in the draft. RA's contract will likely be higher than any of the OL contracts doled out and having a flexibility to take a 2nd or 3rd round receiver over an IOL player will likely leave us with a better WR and a better IOL than if we resigned RA and drafted an IOL. 


A field-stretching WR is a good component to have as a team, but his track record isn't inspiring to where we should buy into the hype that we're Sanchez-ing Darnold if we lose him. We have an offseason to make significant investments into the WR corps and we shouldn't feel obligated to pay up for talent that isn't irreplaceable. We NEED an early round WR whether we keep RA or not because RA is not WR1 material. Acting like he NEEDS to be in the picture is falling too hard for a narrative."
518,2020-02-01 22:00:02,ex2yis,"Not to mention, the Eagles are 13th in positional spending for WRs so saying they don't pay WRs isn't even a valid argument when they gave Aghelor and Jeffery both more average money than what Robby is asking for."
519,2020-02-01 21:51:32,ex2yis,"I agree that we shouldn't draft a WR in the first, but the way I look at it is whether or not we sign Robby we have a dire positional need at WR. It is probably our third or fourth greatest need behind OLine, Edge, and a toss up with our secondary. 

So even with Robby on the team, we really *should* draft a second WR piece. You could probably get good receiver value in the third round, especially this year. If we let Robby walk we'd probably have to draft an additional receiver to cover losing him. That's two thirds for a position that could have been fixed with one and some moderate free agent spending.  

>Because we're horrible offensively even with the supposed talent of RA.

Because even most people who fully support Robby agree that he isn't a true #1 WR. Putting the blame for the Jets offensive failures at the feet of a player who is already punching above his weight is a bit short-sighted, especially when it's clear that our offensive woes mainly stem from the line. Letting him walk because the offense was bad last year is essentially saying that a deep-threat specialist WR should be the fulcrum around which the entire offense moves, and I don't think that's the case."
520,2020-02-02 15:26:06,ex2yis,"> His stats speak for themselves.

No they don't.

If he put up these numbers throughout his career with stable and good QB play, there'd be a point.

Instead, he's put up these numbers with Josh McCown, Bryce Petty, Ryan Fitzpatrick, Geno Smith, Luke Falk, and then FINALLY Sam Darnold. And whaddaya know, when he has Darnold on the field he improves.

The stats lie in this scenario, and the idea that we know for CERTAIN that a late round WR would be as good is absolutely absurd."
521,2020-02-02 15:59:32,ex2yis,"A pretty solid amount actually. RA was undrafted. The draft is hit and miss regardless of what position we’re talking about. But the idea is based on the very real concept that serviceable wr’s are not terribly hard to come by. Especially if you have a good qb who can make them look better than they really are. Anderson isn’t anything special. He’s a game breaking deep threat who is about to be overpaid. That’s where his talents end. 

There’s no reason we can’t draft and develop a good wr in the range I mentioned and pay him a fraction of what RA will get."
522,2020-02-02 14:39:23,ex2yis,"Since we have the cap space, it wouldn't destroy us, but I still don't think he's worth it. He only can go straight down and doesn't separate. He runs sloppy routes. He gives up on plays. It's whatever at this point."
523,2020-02-03 16:06:27,ex2yis,"Well of course the draft is a total crapshoot. And I’m not saying Robby is a poor WR - he just disappears for long stretches of time and pops up with a huge game here and there.


He’s a good complementary receiver - he’d thrive in a Tyreek Hill situation where Kelce/Watkins draw coverage and attention. Robby doesn’t have the route tree or strength to be a true WR1 - his only elite skill is his speed."
524,2020-02-02 16:51:41,ex2yis,"> But the idea is based on the very real concept that serviceable wr’s are not terribly hard to come by.

But they have been hard to come by for years. You said it yourself. The draft his hit and miss, so why do you think it would be so easy to find a replacement for a good but not great WR in RA? 

Look at the success rate for rounds 1-3 compared to 4-7. More successful players overwhelmingly come from earlier rounds.

> There’s no reason we can’t draft and develop a good wr in the range

Except for the fact that this happens *EXTREMELY RARELY* throughout the entire history of the NFL...?"
525,2020-02-01 04:20:03,ex0fy8,I like that you added the potential targets
526,2020-02-01 04:43:02,ex0fy8,"Good job.

I'd be happy if we took 3 offensive lineman and the rest D. I want to draft a LT with the 4th pick. Wirfs or Andrew Thomas.

WRs can always be found and I happen to think Slayton can be a #1 option"
527,2020-02-01 14:32:18,ex0fy8,I would think the big name pass rusher Giants persue in FA is Yannick Ngakoue
528,2020-02-01 17:51:42,ex0fy8,">  This once proud franchise 

We might have not won many regular season games in the last five years, but we are still a proud franchise. **Forever proud.**

Great analysis nonetheless, I agree with most of the points you made here."
529,2020-02-01 18:27:06,ex0fy8,"I don't think WR is as pressing of a need as you think it is. Yes, we have no true number 1 world beater type of guy, but we have the talent that is required for a Jason Garrett offense. He generally runs his outside WRs (Slayton and maybe another mid round guy) deep, and he has his slots (Shepard and Tate) run corners and crossers. They're all effective enough to put some points on the board for us. 

Tackle is a huge need, I would be ok with bringing Remmers back for depth on a cheap deal. I am thinking we either go LT in the first and move Solder to RT or go RT and hope that Marc Colombo can get Solder back to being the definition of league average as opposed to the revolving door he has been the past 2 years. I think Colombo is one of the better coaches in the game and he can help Hernandez take the next step we were expecting last season, as well as getting Zeitler back to an elite level. 

Center is a pressing need as well. I would be more comfortable paying Connor McGovern than drafting someone. I want a veteran in the middle to call out protections and make Jones' job a little easier. 

I can see us taking a late round RB that is more of a hammer to Barkleys scalpel.

We're probably gonna get a FA back up QB. 

TE is interesting though. Ellison may be a cap casualty, and Engram has trouble with blocking, drops, and not getting hurt. He may be someone we sell off at the trade deadline. Or he may be just the right kind of pass catching TE that Garrett covets. Smith looks like the type of TE Jerry Reese would have brought in. I wouldn't be surprised if we spend a mid round pick on a TE, especially if they can block. 

We're set at IDL especially if we resign William's

EDGE is a huge need for us. I can see us double dipping in FA and the draft. I think we bring Golden back, but your were right in that he isnt a true number 1 guy.  Whether it is bringing back Golden and pairing him with Ngakoue, or hoping Gross-Matos falls to the second. 

LB is another hole for us. Ogletree will probably be cut. Connelly showed flashes before getting hurt. Mayo can be brought back cheap as solid depth. What I would like to see is Littleton being brought in to be our coverage LB. I know many people are screaming for Isaiah Simmons, but I don't think he is in play at 4. Scouts always hype up these swiss army knife defenders to go early, and FOs wind up taking them later than projected. It's a case where a guy that plays many positions has no true base position. 

We have Peppers, another swiss army knife guy that fell in the draft, and Mike Thomas at SS. I think were OK there.

I know a lot of people are clamoring for a FA or early round FS, but I would be ok with sending Love back there and maybe pick up a late round or UFA true centerfielder. Bethea is gonna get cut based on age alone. 

CB is also interesting. We have drafted heavily there the past 2 seasons and we can't really be sure if it is working. Beal has been hurt a lot. Baker and Ballentine both looked bad. But they were also playing with a different DC who was entirely scheme dependent, and didn't try to change things to put them in a position to succeed. When he saw those two getting picked on, he made literally no changes and left them to fend for themselves. In case you don't remember the game where we made an injured Mitch Trubisky look like a top tier starter because of Bettcher refusing to adapt his scheme, read this article. https://www.google.com/amp/s/newyork.cbslocal.com/2019/11/25/new-york-giants-chicago-bears-mitchell-trubisky/amp/

Bettcher was straight ass in NY. The only reason he was good in Arizona was because he had bona fide All Pro talent all over the defense there. Our new DC is more of a personnel guy interested in developing talent and deploying players to use their strengths. He may think we can work with what we have in house, or maybe he wants a veteran leader and locker room guy. I don't really see him pounding on the table and screaming for a CB at 4 though. 

So I'm thinking FA targets should be LB, C, EDGE, and possibly RT to go to get Jack Conklin. 

OT and EDGE should probably be round 1 and 2 in the draft (in no particular order) regardless of FA acquisitions. We may trade back and get additional capital, so I would rather draft BPA to a need than to say definitively go one position in round 1 then the other in round 2.

Rounds 3 (assumed comp pick), 4, and 5 should be a mix of value picks at LB, EDGE, RB, WR, CB

Rounds 6 & 7 they can look for ST guys and skill position depth."
530,2020-02-01 18:02:07,ex0fy8,"We literally have no (healthy) starting center, how can our need not be 10/10?"
531,2020-02-01 04:32:05,ex0fy8,"7/10 for WR the same as ILB, 4/10 for RB which is somehow worse than TE. Sorry this is bad."
532,2020-02-01 14:27:45,ex0fy8,"With just under 5:00 remaining in a Week 17 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles Halapio tore his achilles.

He likely starts year on PUP or cut via injury settlement."
533,2020-02-01 17:53:39,ex0fy8,"I believe Halapio tore his Achilles late into the year so I doubt he’ll be the Week 1 starter. Maybe Spencer Pulley but i think he’s a FA. 

Baker played significantly better after week 11 or so. I dont think he’ll ever be true great CB1 but I’m ok with him being the CB1 going into next year. 

How dare you not mention Zak DeOisse. LS for a dozen years. 

I think there’s a chance we cut Rhett Ellison for cap. 

With Golden as a FA I’d personally put pass rusher higher than an 8/10 just because we have nothing but I think they target Ngakoue. And there’s no one at 4 worth taking so we’re kinda in a tough spot."
534,2020-02-01 06:18:48,ex0fy8,"Great write-up.

As bad as we need a CB, I can't fathom drafting yet another one in the 1st.

My dream is signing Conklin in FA, and trading back with MIA/LAC to get the 3rd rounder back that Gettleman threw in the garbage on Leonard Williams. Grabbing Simmons at 6 or 7 and picking up Patrick Queen with our early 2nd, if he's still there."

541,2020-02-03 08:25:58,ex0fy8,"It’s a need. I just think that a) there isn’t a stud center on the market worth shelling out big bucks for, and b) it’s a deep, albeit not stacked center class in the draft. The guy you take in the late first-early second range isn’t that much better than a guy you can get in the third or fourth. It’s definitely a need. Just not an area to target with priority assets like big bucks or high picks due to the pool of talent"
542,2020-02-01 05:20:06,ex0fy8,I mean Barkley got hurt last season. With him gone our offense kinda stalled

I do know Daniel Jones is going into year 2 and we can't see him have his development hindered by being hurried all day or hurt. His receivers also need time to finish their routes.

Also, Barkley is going into year 3. We need to take advantage and open real holes for him.

We need a real OL."

549,2020-02-01 05:01:23,ex0fy8,"I think looking at the personnel (specifically your two best OL in Zeitler and Hernandez), that they should go with a gap/power scheme to capitalize on their strength and less than ideal mobility in getting to the second level. If that's the case, Thomas is that much more valuable to y'all at #4 over guys like Becton and Josh Jones in late round 1 or early round 2 who are more purely ZBS guys IMO. That and this class is gap/power heavy for interior OL, so if you did need a center, you should have a chance to snag a decent option late day two or early day three."

Nothing has been more obvious in any past draft that we need OL first and foremost.

565,2020-01-31 21:16:45,ewtj7n,I’d actually try to check it out in more detail over the weekend. And maybe checkout the code as well. May have some questions for you if you’re okay with that hah!

766,2020-01-30 20:41:17,ew9b6k,I completely agree with you that his skills were very well-suited for that role. I just didn't want to use Turkoglu as a direct comp because Turkoglu played Point Forward much more regularly than Kukoc did. I mean his pick and roll with Dwight was pretty much one of the Magics go to plays. I agree though that Turkoglu is the best comparison in recent history if it has to be a 1 to 1 comp.

They usually give criteria that they must meet before endorsing.  As for Kahele & Boylan, there websites speak for themselves.

814,2020-01-30 05:06:47,ew05yp,Im literally obsessed how his voice sounds in the song. he should’ve keep it for himself. Period
815,2020-01-30 05:47:31,ew05yp,Sam Smith voice fits the song better but I could be bias... I'd love a re-release of Icarus Falls but 27 track of him covering hits from 2019
816,2020-01-30 05:26:06,ew05yp,"Ugh, I hate when you find out a song has been passed between artists like notes in school. It just gives that much more credence to the people who deny the genre."
817,2020-01-30 10:58:38,ew05yp,Are we sure it's him on the track? The only one I could find sounds like a weirdly pitched version to make it sound like Zayn's voice.
818,2020-01-30 08:29:45,ew05yp,"I can’t find it, but I will say that the first time I heard Sam Smith’s version, it seemed like a Zayn song."
819,2020-01-30 12:46:14,ew05yp,better than the original but I can't see Zayn releasing music that is pure pop
820,2020-01-30 14:27:26,ew05yp,This makes me wonder why Sam has writing credits on this. Carly having credits in Making the most of the night when the Sia demo has the same lyrics teas.
821,2020-01-30 14:17:29,ew05yp,The only one I can find isn't actually him at all
822,2020-01-30 10:53:09,ew05yp,Doesn’t sound like him at all tbh. It’s someone else imo.
823,2020-01-30 13:29:07,ew05yp,Is this definitely real? I thought Sam was the writer of the song. Was there just a moment in time where it might’ve been given to Zayn but Sam kept it?
824,2020-01-30 14:38:08,ew05yp,"I want that version. Sam's voice is ok, but too shreaky when he hits the high notes."
825,2020-01-30 06:10:29,ew05yp,I think I like Sam Smiths voice just a little more then I do Zayns.
826,2020-01-30 12:24:59,ew05yp,Are there any lyric differences?
827,2020-01-30 21:26:44,ew05yp,"Zayn should’ve kept it, his version has a tone that fits with the production. Sam’s is good but the song is somewhat not his style"

835,2020-01-30 19:30:08,ew05yp,"very possible...similar to how Gaga wrote Telephone and it got passed to Britney, then back to Gaga."
836,2020-01-30 10:10:39,ew05yp,"it is basically a part of the stereotype that pop stars are untalented and don’t write their own music. most, if not all, other genres’ music is written by the artist and their writers. so when a song is written by writers and sent around to a bunch of different artists it means that the singer isn’t a “real artist” to some people.

people even say this on this sub (see: threads about selena gomez’s new album)"
837,2020-01-30 21:34:12,ew05yp,"thank you!! I feel like I've been here forever, it's hard to believe!"
838,2020-01-30 20:30:48,ew05yp,"But Zayn doesn't appear among the credits of the songs. Although I read somewhere else that apparently it's nos Zayn but one of the writers singing, they just sound alike."
839,2020-01-30 20:31:37,ew05yp,I read that apparently it's the voice of someone from Max Martin's team singing. Still weird how Sam appears as one of the songwriters.
840,2020-01-31 02:17:07,ew05yp,"Oh true I forgot that.  Excellent example. This may just be me imposing my life on a song but something about How Do You Sleep has also just felt a bit more gay culture-y to me than something Zayn would sing, so that makes sense. I can easily relate to Sam on this issue because it’s normal in gay culture to have this kind of messy, uncertain, suddenly over relationship. And also more common for a straight woman to express this sentiment regarding a man. It seems slightly less common for a man like Zayn... I hope no one is offended by this. I know straight men are cheated, so I don’t mean that. Anyways....these vodka sodas are making this messy gay ramble 🤭"
841,2020-01-30 10:22:44,ew05yp,"Ahh, I get it. I hate that stereotype too. Personally I don't really care whether an artist writes their own music or not (unless they lie about it, I guess). I mean, not every songwriter can sing. I'm glad there are people who can take their work and perform it the best they can."
842,2020-01-30 23:49:39,ew05yp,"Which is complete bullshit when you consider that the classical musicians we think of as ""most legitimate"" almost never perform pieces they write themselves.  Even things like trills and cadenzas that were historically improvised are now standardized for modern classical musicians."
843,2020-01-30 06:10:50,evzlnq,Richie incognito just got 2yr/14 million so I think you’re going to pay a bit more than 6-7 for Spain
844,2020-01-30 04:24:25,evzlnq,Great job! These have all been very helpful so kudos to everyone so far.
845,2020-01-30 05:52:21,evzlnq,"This is really thorough and detailed, I enjoyed it !  One thing I would say is that if Beane does trade up in the first I dont think it would be for a WR (at least I hope not) but rather if they think they need to to secure an Edge player may be falling."
846,2020-01-30 11:07:22,evzlnq,"Does Cody Ford have experience playing guard as well? I didn’t really follow him in college so I’m not sure if he’s played that position before . I’m assuming he does. Regardless of his disappointing first year, that type of versatility is so important for any oline . In the eagles case , Vitai played on both sides of the line both at T and G. Not an exceptional player, but his versatility to come into any position on the line made him a serviceable commodity ."
847,2020-01-30 16:48:13,evzlnq,Only thing I disagree about is tackle. I think we really explore moving Ford to guard. He improved as the season went on but he was still a liability and was beat routinely in the wild card game.
848,2020-01-30 13:36:42,evzlnq,"Great breakdown! I do however disagree on OT and think it is a much higher need for us, although I suppose that's because I don't view Cody Ford as a long-term starting Right Tackle. I would probably put OT at a 7 or 8/10 and OG at a 3/10, with the assumption that if we retain Quinton Spain and move Ford inside we will be pretty solid for depth on the inside then draft or sign a RT to hopefully take over for Nsekhe.

I dunno if that qualifies as a need but I do think it will be going through Brandon Beane's mind on draft day, if the right guy falls to him he could make that move to put the best OL in front of Allen. Ford got beat too many times and led the team in sacks/pressures playing on the outside, but could be a monster Guard."
849,2020-01-30 09:23:40,evzlnq,"Getting Ruggs in the 1st as our big play/ceiling guy is an absolute dream (hopefully with little or no draft capital lost)

And then getting a possession guy in the 3rd like Bryan Edwards/Pittman/Mims/Johnson (although I think he might be gone by then)"
850,2020-01-30 20:38:11,evzlnq,Bruh OT is a big need. Ford was garbage and Nsekhe is old and has one year left under contract.
851,2020-01-30 07:34:51,evzlnq,"Allen seemed... nervous (?)In the wildcard game. I think it was the definition of trying to do too much. Especially when he tried to pitch it to his TE. (Although if it worked he would’ve been a genius!) 

A view from someone who isn’t a Buffalo fan though, Allen could be very scary in the future and in my opinion, with some maturing, has the potential to bring a Super Bowl to Buffalo."
852,2020-01-30 16:26:37,evzlnq,"Loved this, very thorough. Had fun cross-referencing your evaluations with PFF (finding you were pretty much spot on). 

My only question: you seem pretty lukewarm on Trent Murphy. Is that because you think he'll walk? He scored very well on PFF's grading scale (75+). Does this maybe not tell the whole story? Or is he ""overall disappointing"" because he's paid too much?"
853,2020-01-30 17:13:14,evzlnq,"My FA list so far: Cory Littleton - LA Rams, Bud Dupree - Pittsburgh Steelers, Vernon Butler - Carolina Panthers.

They each bring something different to the table. Cory Littleton fits our LB mold, he's got great side to side speed and can run really well with TEs and RBs. He's a tackle and production machine - he can get outmuscled. Considering what our defense looked like when Milano was out/injured, having a real 3rd interchangeable LB might be nice. 6'3, plays around 230 probably - the Rams are going to have a tough time keeping him.   He's a replacement for LoZo that's more like a Milano clone.

Bud Dupree is probably a long shot, but Pittsburgh's cap is shit and he's a really good pass-rushing OLB.  He's a Lawson replacement option.  Shit, even if we re-sign Shaq, cut Murphy if you can get Bud in the building. He's a freak athlete and is a big-boi replacement for LoZo. Terror against the run and pass.  

Vernon Butler was drafted by the current Bills brain trust, so I figured I would just put this dart on the board.  He had a career high this year in sacks with 6.5 after three years of modest production.  He's been a force there with Kawaan Short, but maybe he's in for a reunion with McDermott? The Panthers are one small step away from total rebuild status and the Cory Liuget/Vincent Taylor/Kyle Peko combination ain't it chief.  

They will probably get none of these guys in the building, but I tried to towards the more modest end of the free agent market. These guys represent good value in free agency - and fill roles the Bills need on Defense.  

I have no clue who to get on offense."
854,2020-01-30 17:25:16,evzlnq,"This is very well done!

I might move CB a little higher - obviously it depends on who is re-signed, but they may want a bigger/more physical CB to play the boundary opposite Tre White and make those other guys slot/sub-package players"
855,2020-01-30 06:52:49,evzlnq,Jadeveon Clowney will be a Buffalo Bill.
856,2020-01-30 15:28:00,evzlnq,"Good job breaking down the needs into pre- and post- free agency. With as much space as we have, the FA options are nearly limitless, which makes mock drafting fairly difficult. So far Beane's MO has been to at least address needs with stop-gaps in FA so that they can follow their board on draft day. 

Fans should brace themselves for some unsexy FA signings and a possibly unexpected position in the 1st round, followed by eating crow by the end of next season."
857,2020-01-30 15:33:30,evzlnq,I feel like 6-7M is still doable for Spain unless someone is gonna try to grab him in FA and up his value. Anything more and I would let him walk and look in the draft for in the 2nd-3rd round to replace him. Maybe look at a Ben Bredensen or Logan Stenberg in the 3rd and use the 2nd round on a DE/pass rusher.
858,2020-01-30 18:26:55,evzlnq,"Good for him man... that's a lot of $ for a guard his age. 

As we know he's a pro bowl caliber guard... Spain at this point is not."
859,2020-01-30 15:34:13,evzlnq,Trade up for Epenesa?
860,2020-01-30 14:17:56,evzlnq,He played there for about 2 seasons in college including his freshman year. I think he’ll stay at tackle but Beane has said they haven’t totally locked in his position yet.
861,2020-01-30 16:53:48,evzlnq,Position switches are pretty rare tbh. He was a rookie. More likely than not they just run it back at OT.
862,2020-01-30 23:38:20,evzlnq,"Ford was not “garbage,” and don’t quote PFF grades at me. For a rookie tackle he was solid, and he’s only gonna get better as he improves his footwork. Nsekhe is old yes but he also didn’t enter the NFL until very late and was primarily a backup in Washington, so he doesn’t have a ton of mileage on him. 

If they move Ford inside things change a lot, but I think it’s more likely he stays at RT."
863,2020-01-30 12:47:23,evzlnq,"He did try to do too much, but I actually think that's somewhat encouraging. Throughout the season our OC would go ultra conservative with the play calling if they were up by two scores which is why a large portion of Bills fans wanted him gone at the end of the season. So imagine watching the opposing team crawl back into the game while you watch Frank Gore run up the middle for 2yds on 1st and 2nd down (why they didn't use Singletary when he was getting 5yds per carry is a mystery to us all). Then when you hit the reciever on third down, its dropped, or John Brown feels the need to jump in the air to catch a ball that's already at eye level and lands out of bounds. I think the bills were responsible for something like 6/13 drops in the wildcard round. So I think Allen trying to do too much isn't that uncalled for. And I think a reliable receiver to make contested catches would go a long long way for him"
864,2020-01-30 17:03:53,evzlnq,"I’m probably too hard on Murphy. I personally don’t put a lot of stock in PFF grades, he was better this year than last but he definitely has underperformed his contract. Me wanting to cut him is more about trying to replace him and improve the DE position group, rather than him not being a solid player. 

Edit - we have Jerry Hughes under contract next year and Daryl Johnson has a ton of potential and 3 years left on his rookie deal. If we don’t re-sign Shaq and bring in a new DE then Murphy stays, and we probably keep him through camp and could possibly get picks for him if we find a replacement for him. He’s also out of contract after this year."
865,2020-01-30 16:56:54,evzlnq,Murphy is inconsistent. If you polled fans most would think he was overall bad. He’s an okay rotational guy but nothing that should keep us from drafting DE.
866,2020-01-30 17:55:47,evzlnq,"CB was hard to quantify because we have all our starting spots covered and we have Siran Neal who can backup Taron in the nickel and also looked promising as an outside corner in limited snaps. Like I said we definitely could upgrade, but we also definitely don’t NEED to and are more likely to bring in some depth."
867,2020-01-30 09:25:48,evzlnq,"I hope not, I'd want Ngakoue instead.

Clowney is a good player but frequently injured and probably a poor character fit."
868,2020-01-30 14:15:11,evzlnq,As a Bills fan I highly doubt it: we want high motor guys with good character. He’s an athletic freak but he’ll go to a team like the Falcons.
869,2020-01-30 15:33:26,evzlnq,"Yep, spot on with Beane's MO. Plugging holes in FA is exactly what I expect, although I'm hoping for at least one big splash (Ngakoue pls). 

At this point I almost never criticize Beane for his decisions, he's missed a handful of times but he almost always gets it right. If they do something totally unexpected and/or take a guy I was low on, I'll trust they know more than me."
870,2020-01-30 16:56:35,evzlnq,"There is no doubt that Quinton Spain was a huge upgrade over turnstile Vlad Ducasse at LG, but if Beane wants to upgrade the LG position, even more, he could move Cody Ford to LG, where Ford plays his sophomore season at Oklahoma and draft a RT in the 1st or 2nd round.

Another option would be to draft a LG like Solomon Kindley or Shane Lemieux in the 2nd or 3rd round."
871,2020-01-30 23:18:59,evzlnq,"I mean contracts only increase as the cap space goes up, not a ton of guards can say they didn’t give up a sack last year. Who knows free agency is always unpredictable"
872,2020-01-30 15:35:45,evzlnq,From what I've been reading from others I would hope so!
873,2020-01-30 16:59:33,evzlnq,"I believe Cody Ford started at LG in his sophomore season at Oklahoma and he played some RG reps in Buffalo last year.

IMO Cody Ford would be a much better Guard than Tackle, I would move him inside and draft a Tackle in a draft class that has some high end talent."
874,2020-01-30 16:58:25,evzlnq,"It's not particularly rare at all for offensive line, in fact versatility is something that is valued, especially for depth guys. They could very well leave him at tackle but I have to believe they recognize there are still improvements need along the line. If the opportunity to improve the tackle position arises I think the Bills would be interested."
875,2020-01-31 00:27:47,evzlnq,Fords biggest issue was getting beat with speed cause of his ow feet. That's not really something you can expect somebody to improve.
876,2020-01-31 06:45:19,evzlnq,"Ford was great as a run blocker at RT, he struggled at times in pass protection vs athletic edge rushers.

A lot of rookie OL struggle at first, so it was not unusual seeing a slow learning curve for Ford.

If Ford and improve his technique and footwork with anther year of Bobby Johnson coaching him up than his pass protection should improve.

But I wouldn't be surprised if Beane doesn't re-sign Quinton Spain, moves Ford to guard then drafts someone like Josh Jones or Mekhi Becton to play RT."
877,2020-01-30 23:43:24,evzlnq,"Foot speed is not going to be something that improves for Ford. Just watching him, it's clear that his terrible footwork is a result of his lack of speed. He can't match the outside rush with his kick slide so he's literally turning his entire frame to run and chase. Not even Beane is willing to commit to him at RT and he traded up for the guy.

I also don't get your pff comment. Forget them, most film analysts that have seen him think he's a guard and not a tackle."
878,2020-01-30 16:08:36,evzlnq,Sounds like you should draft Tee Higgins :)
879,2020-01-31 06:39:45,evzlnq,If Shaq Lawson is not re-signed than Beane should target Ngakoue or Judon.
880,2020-01-30 18:42:50,evzlnq,"I would like to see Beane sign WR Breshad Perriman and RB Matt Breida in free agency to add speed to the skill positions and fill holes in the line up.

As for edge rusher, I see Beane either re-signing Shaq Lawson or signing Matt Judon or Yannick Ngakoue because this is a bad draft for edge rushers. That way Beane can go BPA at 22 and not be forced to make a pick at a position of need."
881,2020-01-30 18:09:33,evzlnq,">I have to believe they recognize there are still improvements need along the line. 

If they run it back that just means they think Ford will improve in year 2."
882,2020-01-30 16:12:28,evzlnq,I would be happy with him or Shenault
883,2020-01-30 17:00:21,evzlnq,Tee Higgins or Laviska Shenualt would be perfect fits for Allen.
884,2020-01-30 17:43:06,evzlnq,"You guys are 1 playmaker away from being super bowl contenders with that defense. Any chance you trade up in the draft for WR1? If not, I could see you taking Ruggs early honestly and then a bigger WR like Pittman in the 3rd or Collin Johnson even later"
885,2020-01-30 18:19:45,evzlnq,"I love Ruggs big play ability, he should be a top 15. If Ruggs runs a 4.2 40 a lot of team are going to want him and he is a much better prospect than John Ross coming out in 2017, and I believe he will go in the top 10.

Beane has shown that he will trade up for players he likes like he did in 2018 for Allen and Edmunds.

I would be ok with traded a 2021 1st round pick and the 2020 1st round pick to move up to get Ruggs as I see Buffalo making the playoffs in 2020 and the 1st round pick being 21st or lower in 2021."
886,2020-02-04 16:30:32,evzlnq,"Too many WR's to move up for 1.  I don't see it happening, not sacrificing another 1st.

I think we're better off with Shenault, or Higgins instead of Ruggs as is, even with his speed - although even though he's only 6', that's still taller than our current options.  Allen isn't very accurate deep, Smoke is quick as it is, and we need that bigger go up and get it, or extend and grab it type of WR.

I do like Ruggs, just not enough to give up that much for him."
887,2020-02-04 16:37:02,evzlnq,"If the scouting department believe Henry Ruggs can be a Tyreek Hill type talent with out the off field issues of Hill, than he is absolutely worth trading up to acquire and giving up a 2021 1st round pick which will be 21st overall or lower because Buffalo should make the playoffs in 2020.

Allen can improve his deep ball placement and showed his ability by hitting on two deep throws vs New England with the deep TD pass to John Brown down the middle of the field and the long pass to Dawson Knox down the left sideline.

Having a WR with elite deep speed forces CB's to play with lot of cushion which opens up the short pass routes like speed outs, hitches, screen passes, and slants. 

We will see what happens but a lot of teams could fall in love with Henry Ruggs and Ruggs should go in the top 10."
888,2020-02-04 16:42:01,evzlnq,"He could, but no drafts are putting him that high currently.  Most have him right before us.

I can almost guarantee we won't give up next years 1st though.  Beane values draft picks too much.  He's for sure willing to move up and down, but there's no way he would for a 1st, let alone for a WR.

Even if he's 4.3 speed and a Tyreek ""prospect"", he could be a John Ross instead. you don't sell a future 1st for a WR in a really deep WR class."
889,2020-02-04 17:10:28,evzlnq,"If you have watching Henry Ruggs you will know that he is further along than John Ross was as a prospect coming out of Washington.

Ruggs is not a stereotypical soft deep threat WR, he likes to block, he will make tough catches over the middle when he knows he will get hit. Ruggs is a dynamic play maker.

Ruggs has plays very fast in pads and he should run a 4.2 40.

Beane has shown he will trade up for talent like he did to acquire Josh Allen and Tremaine Edmunds.

I would have no problem trading the 22nd overall pick in 2020 and the 2021 1st round draft pick that should be a late round pick for a prospect that is 6'0"" 190 lbs in Henry Ruggs that is a match up nightmare for defenses.

I don't think it will happen because Ruggs should be a top 10 pick."
890,2020-02-04 17:19:02,evzlnq,"I'm just saying you never know with draft picks and we won't be trading a future 1st to jump for a WR in a deep class.

I like Ruggs, I don't foresee it happening though."
891,2020-02-04 17:27:09,evzlnq,"I don't see a high probability of the move happening but Ruggs draft stock will sky rocket after the combine. 

I don't judge prospects just off of the combine, as it is just a piece of the puzzle but it will reaffirm that he is faster than a hiccup and what you see on tape is correct with his ability to consistently separate from coverage.

The Philadelphia Eagles desperately need speed at WR and I could see them trading up to get Henry.

I would not be upset if Beane traded up to get Ruggs and I see Ruggs as a better player than Sammy Watkins."
892,2020-02-04 17:32:56,evzlnq,"That was before Beane. He's willing to trade up, but I don't think he's willing to give up a 1st. If it was a 3rd this year for a few spots or 3rd and swap 2nd, maybe."
893,2020-01-30 00:44:43,evwbox,That draft would be absolutely amazing but it seems somewhat unlikely to me.
894,2020-01-30 00:34:43,evwbox,Hell of a fall for Biadasz who is projected to go in the late first early second. And even Mekhi is more than likely gonna be a first rounder.
895,2020-01-30 00:56:46,evwbox,"While I agree bringing in a veteran CB should be a priority, I want NO part of Claiborne on this team. This guy has been consistently unimpressive everywhere he’s been. (Could be some anti-Cowboys bias here too). I haven’t really looked at who else could potentially be available though and he may ultimately end up being the best option. Other than that I think this is a solid blueprint. That draft would be a dream scenario, though I think Cushenberry might be more realistic in the 3rd."
896,2020-01-30 01:31:23,evwbox,"Great stuff man, I love seeing OC like this. As a couple other people pointed out rounds 2 and 3 seem unlikely, but I'm absolutely down with Simmons at 4 then OL with 2. With that much left over cap I hope they could bring in 2 more starters at 8-10 mill year, not really sure who is available in FA though. Cheers."
897,2020-01-30 02:18:40,evwbox,"I appreciate the effort but I would not be a fan of those major moves. I am not a fan of drafting Isaiah Simmons at #4. I 100% think he is more of a luxury pick than a necessity and he overlaps with Jabril Peppers.

I think Ngakoue is an incredibly overrated free agent and I'd want to stay away from him. I would rather have Markus Golden back for cheaper. If you look at their production between the two it is roughly the same and this is with Golden playing on a horrible defense while Ngakoue played on a very good one from other pass rushers to the DBs. 

The one thing I would love is Becton falling to Round 2 though."
898,2020-01-30 01:52:18,evwbox,I appreciate your work but I’m no way we get all three of those guys in the draft. All three of them are slotted to go in the first.
899,2020-01-30 14:43:16,evwbox,"Thanks for this Fill! Great content as always. Draft looks like a wet dream, I'd love Simmons, but I honestly think Gentlemen will go OL first round."
900,2020-01-30 16:57:59,evwbox,"I like it.  Here are a few of my comments:

* I would keep Bethea and have him earn a backup role unless we absolutely need the cap space.  I like the thought of having a solid veteran presence in case things go bad, but I'm not tied to him.
* I too would try to resign Golden as he is effective.  He's not worth top dollar, but having him opposite another good pass rusher in a 3-4 style defense is a good idea.
* I'm glad you moved Carter away from a pure EDGE rusher position.  I hope he gets better, but IIRC he was used in many more roles in college, so we should probably take advantage of that.  There was also an article suggesting that he could be used in a similar manner to Danielle Hunter that I just can't seem to find anymore that made a lot of sense as well.
* I'm not sure about Ngakoue either.  If we keep Williams, I think I'd rather get some speedy LB Edge rushers on the outside vs. a DE.  However, I don't know what the plan is, so I'm most likely wrong."
901,2020-01-30 18:53:02,evwbox,"My thoughts:

* You are switching to a 4-3, but you keep a prototypical 3-4 nose tackle in Tomlinson. You are also using Leonard Williams as a 4-3 DE, when he should really play DT over Tomlinson IMO. Also, neither Tomlinson nor Williams are sufficiently explosive pash rushers for us to rely on them for literally 50% of the d-line. Apparently our former DC agreed with that assessment, since he had Williams replace Tomlinson inside when we played 4-man fronts. He had Carter play in the left DE position on those snaps. 

* In a similar vein, you are hiring Ngakoue, who is a 3-4 OLB, to play DE in your 4-3. I have my doubts about that working out. Which is why I would rather see that huge pile of cash thrown at Fowler than Ngakoue. Fowler is a more schemattically flexible player, which is a better fit for Graham's hybrid defense, too. Also, I believe that Fowler is more likely to be available.

* I would like to see a bigger spend on a CB. Baker, Beal and Love are probably going to be good players in a couple of years, but until then we a bunch of ""2nd row"" players. E.g. Byron Jones might be available. Also, according to your depth chart Hamilton is way to close to ever playing a defensive snap again. It might be a good idea to sign one good CB in free agency and to draft another one for depth. 

* Similarly, you are going into the draft without having adressed the ILB situation beyond bumping Carter inside. (Which I have my doubts about, also.) That's super risky in addition to there not being an experienced guy to be the ""QB of the front 7"". I don't care how hyped Simmons is, we need an ILB in the starting lineup who isn't on a rookie contract.

* Apparently Tanney is very good in the film room, which is why they chose him over Lauletta. I don't see them hiring another QB to replace him. 

* I really really really disagree with the current circlejerk of mocking Simmons to us at #4. I feel that he is grossly over rated right now, just because he balled out in the one CFB game many people watched. But even if he was a top 5 player, I see no way he will be picked by the Giants. Here is why: either Derrick Brown or Jeff Okudah is going to not be picked by the Lions. Maybe both, if either the Racialslurs or the Lions trade down. Brown is a much better 4-3 DT than Williams (and Tomlinson) IMO and picking him would allow us to play Williams at DE. Okudah is just amazing and would be an awesome solution to our CB woes for the foreseeable future. Simmons is a more athletic version of Peppers. Even if you see him more as an ILB, that still is a far less valuable position than DT and CB. And even if we assume that yes, Simmons is that good, that raises the question why the Lions didn't pick him at #3. Because their biggest need is ILB."
902,2020-01-30 18:53:34,evwbox,"I like it and would feel pretty good if this is how the offseason went. I think between FA and the draft a lot of needs are address without reaching. That being said I don’t think Becton will be available round two at this point, unfortunately. However, I’m sure you could just as easily switch OT names in round two so it’s kind of a moot point. I think to bring back Williams and sign an impact edge rusher in FA is a good move because they’ll help each other be more productive. Hopefully Williams asks for a reasonable deal."
903,2020-01-31 03:29:41,evwbox,The thought that Claiborne has anything left in the tank is laughable.
904,2020-01-31 13:18:59,evwbox,Why do we only have one starting edge rusher in your diagram?
905,2020-01-30 00:46:43,evwbox,"There are enough OL prospects to do shuffling, e.g. Josh Jones for Becton or Daryll Williams for Biadasz, but so much of that is fluid I thought this got the point across."
906,2020-01-30 00:42:56,evwbox,"I just go off of The Draft Network's board and mock drafter. They have Biadasz at #103 on their big board right now. Becton is at #25 so that's a reach here - OT has been all over the place by site more than any other group, I'm seeing Wirfs tumble now. Just went with my guy. I think one of Wirfs, Becton, Niang, or Jones will be there to address OT."
907,2020-01-30 01:05:43,evwbox,"I mean, I'm not really arguing he's been impressive, that's why a 29 year old former first round pick is only getting $2M. He's worked with the new secondary coach so that took precedence over the Cowboys bias for me. He's kind of like a Remmers-level of FA where you won't be wowed but he can go out and be average without breaking the bank. If they want to spend a little more then I think Bradberry from the Panthers for $6M or $7M would be ideal, but then you're kind of writing off Beal."
908,2020-01-30 01:40:43,evwbox,"Thanks, yeah I was shooting for a conservative look with room left to be creative. See too many where it is like Yannick, Conklin, Jones, and two more guys and I just don't see it happening like that - adding two more decent players or one quality starter is no problem here."
909,2020-01-30 02:34:48,evwbox,I respect that.
910,2020-01-30 20:37:02,evwbox,I wouldn’t sign either Golden or Ngakoue.  Golden’s production is largely a result of him not being double teamed and cleaning up the work of others like the DL.  Ngakoue is a much better player despite similar production at the surface.  Neither will be worth the money they get.
911,2020-01-30 02:36:21,evwbox,"I get that feeling but every year we hear that from 50 prospects. Becton a few weeks ago was a third and no one knew Lloyd Cushenberry now they're both first rounders. The three draft picks weren't really my focus on names as much as just ""Simmons then two OL""."
912,2020-01-30 22:11:02,evwbox,"You're getting way too into the 3-4/4-3 flat label like it means anything. They had 4 man fronts 75% of the time in the 3-4. 

* That's why he's the Former DC. I'm looking to the Jags, Bears, and 49ers. If Campbell, Hicks, and Armstread can play DE so can Williams.
* Yannick was in coverage 14 times all of last season. He's a DE.
* SAM isn't inside it's off ball like Dee Ford or Kennard.
* Never heard of a team carrying 8 corners.
* Byron Jones isn't worth the $14M estimate.
* So is Rush that's why Garrett kept him three years.
* I'd be fine with Okudah."
913,2020-01-31 03:50:00,evwbox,What $2M free agent corner did you have in mind?
914,2020-01-31 13:54:13,evwbox,"Leonard Williams is in the Arik Armstead, Calais Campbell, Akiem Hicks role."
915,2020-01-30 03:59:34,evwbox,Thats fair but the problem with that approach when creating mock drafts is that most of the skill position players who are ranked above big boys will almost always fall come draft day. There’s also the issue of supply and demand. Also are you using any specific persons bog board or just the TDN overall board because Im not sure how often they update that one or who is even responsible for it. The individual big boards have Biadasz higher than 103 most often closer to 50.
916,2020-01-30 21:07:05,evwbox,"> Ngakoue is a much better player

He would have much better production if he is a much better player. You are basically just saying he is better cause he is."
917,2020-01-30 03:29:40,evwbox,I would love to get Simmons and the center though. That would be huge.
918,2020-01-31 15:03:36,evwbox,Did we see him line up without an edge rusher at his shoulder? I don't remember seeing that.
919,2020-01-30 04:07:13,evwbox,It varies. I've done quite a few and Biadiasz is always there around 100. I've also landed Becton at 37.
920,2020-01-31 02:19:02,evwbox,Statistically Golden was the second least double teamed edge player in the NFL. That affects production.
921,2020-01-30 22:26:11,evwbox,"Alright first off everything you just said is wrong.  A better player can absolutely have worse production than a worse player when we are talking traditional stats that don’t account for context.  I pointed out golden sees less double teams too I didn’t just say he’s better than he is.  Take a look at this.


https://mobile.twitter.com/sethwalder/status/1205218274033721345

Ngakoue is in that cluster just above and to the right of center there.  Golden has his name there and he’s to the left.  Ngakoue saw significantly more double teams and had a better pass rush win rate.  He’s a much better player."
922,2020-01-30 03:46:04,evwbox,Agreed
923,2020-01-31 15:13:00,evwbox,Yes
924,2020-01-30 22:37:19,evwbox,"Using this incredibly stupid graph to determine who is better would show guys like Demarcus Lawrence and Robert Qunn are better than Khalil Mack, Nick Bosa, Chandler Jones, and Von Miller. You want to have that opinion? Go for it but I'll bet you will move the goalposts because anyone making this claim would be as stupid as they look. 

The best pass rushers in the league gets the most pressures, sacks, QB hits, etc. The problem is that Golden beats out Yannick in about all of those things, so your argument is nothing but some graph."
925,2020-01-30 04:52:28,evwbox,Also I wouldn’t mind kicking the tires on Coleman again. Probably could get him for close to Latimer or Core.
926,2020-01-31 15:15:26,evwbox,Any games in particular you'd recommend re-watching for that? I have game pass so it's easy to do so. I'd be interested in seeing what you're describing.
927,2020-01-30 22:49:41,evwbox,Are you okay?  Your responses have been fairly hostile and I don’t think anything I’ve said warrants that.
928,2020-01-30 05:39:09,evwbox,"In my last one I made a ""toss up"" group and had him and Latimer and even Russell Shepard, David Sills, Damari Scott, and Reggie White Jr as an interesting camp tryout for those deep spots. I think Safety depth will be another and probably OL and DL tryouts."
929,2020-01-31 15:17:51,evwbox,"Games he played, not sure what other answer you're looking for."
930,2020-01-30 22:51:50,evwbox,"You said Yannick is a better player, even though he has worse production than Golden because of some graph. The same graph shows Demarcus Lawrence and Robert Qunn are better than Khalil Mack, Nick Bosa, Chandler Jones, and Von Miller too because they get doubled and win more or whatever you are trying to say. 

It sounds pretty dumb to think who is better based on that graph because of it, but that's probably why you ignored it because you have no rebuttal against it. I am surprised you didn't at least try to move the goalposts."
931,2020-01-31 15:50:06,evwbox,You're saying he played on the edge without an OLB in every game?
932,2020-01-31 15:51:57,evwbox,At times. Not nearly enough is the point. I.e. the Arik Armstead parallel.
933,2020-01-29 18:29:47,evq5z6,"That's a pretty solid article, though I wish the writer had brought up a few more non-American films, specifically **Come and See** and (the original) **Fires on the Plain**, which I think come closer to denying the comments of Truffaut - or Sam Fuller, who once said that every war movie was a ""recruiting film"" regardless of it's pacifistic intentions - even than **Paths of Glory.**

I saw **1917** the other day and felt much the same as the author - maybe a little more positive, and I would say I ""liked"" it for sure - and agree that it is essentially a technical exercise, a thrill ride, Indiana Jones in the trenches.  And I could enjoy it for that and admire the craft; I'm not the world's biggest fan of Roger Deakins but I thought his work here was pretty darn good and maybe after this and **BR2049** I need to go back and re-assess my feelings about some of his earlier stuff.  And Mendes and editor Lee Smith certainly succeed in keeping up the energy and constant movement, but at the end of the day to me this feels more like **Raiders** or **True Lies**, or a horror film like **Get Out**, than it does a film really trying to deal with what war is.  And I like those three films, so that's not exactly damning it, but none of them are close to all-time favorites for me, in part because horror and especially action films tend to be deliberately self-limiting, they want to shock or excite or thrill you and **that's all.**  And for me that's usually not enough, and it certainly isn't enough in a film about a real-life, massive human tragedy.  Now the more I think about it the less I like it actually.

In any case for my money this is at best the 4th among the BP nominees, and there are still two I haven't seen.  Deakins' work is solid but I'm not sure it's any better than that or Yorick Le Saux on **Little Women,** Robert Richardson on **Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood** or Roger Prieto in **The Irishman.**   And in terms of it's writing, directing and editing it's not top tier at all IMO.  Still it's better than **Green Book** I suppose, so there's that..."
934,2020-01-31 01:32:59,evq5z6,"It feels like a video with the scripted events that try to make it seem less boring. The cinematography looked fake. Over done digital color in post preduction. Skintones were mushy and gray. I'm sorry, but I'll never like digital cinematography. Music was terribly used and yried way too hard. A whole convoy of trucks 30 yards away and he doesn't notice them. The way he jumped into the water, which looked fake. The stupid soldier he bumps into that never gets up. Nothing felt authentic nor cinematic."
935,2020-01-31 18:26:31,evq5z6,"I'e heard this argument many times and it is just weak to me. I don't come away from Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon (or 1917) thinking ""hey, this looks like fun, we should do this more often"". If anything it would probably make me less inclined to support an armed conflict after watching them. 

Also, the end result of this reasoning (war shouldn't be shown on screen because the screen glamorizes anything it shows) is Hays Code type censoriousness where you can't show any unpunished bad behavior on screen for fear that audiences will imitate it. That attitude appears to be having a revival if people's reactions to Joker and a host of other things are any indication."
936,2020-01-29 18:11:55,evq5z6,"There's some interesting analysis and history here, but ""Doolittle""? Really? I truly don't understand people's intense hatred for this film. Was it perfect? No, but it was still a good movie."
937,2020-01-29 18:42:38,evq5z6,"You know, I actually liked Green Book, but anyway.

What don’t you like about Deakins’ work in general? He doesn’t seem to generally be a washed out cinematographer, I don’t think. I’m curious to hear your thoughts.

Yeah I think you could probably write a very compelling book about this aspect of war movies in general and I’d love to hear a good writers take on it. I have always said that I think Grave of the Fireflies is the greatest anti-war movie, but it’s not a “war movie”, so it wouldn’t really fit into this discussion as much. I’ve never seen Come and See though it’s been on my watchlist for a long time."
938,2020-01-31 19:10:57,evq5z6,"I don’t think the saying is that it makes war look fun, it’s that by the nature of storytelling, you want things to be engaging. Engaging things are generally exciting in some way. So it makes war look exciting just by the nature of telling the story."
939,2020-01-29 19:04:28,evq5z6,"Deakins' work is fine, he's just not OMG THE GREATEST and neither is Emmanuel Lubezki; I like the earlier (pre-2000 or so in the case of Deakins, pre-2012 for Lubezki) work for both better -- it's the increasing use of digital-everything in both men's case that works against them for me.  And yeah, Deakins' stuff isn't totally drained of color, like Lubezki's on **The Revenant**, but it's frequently more muted and dull than what I'd like.  In this film it works pretty well, and I love his work in **The Assassination of Jesse James** but I think a lot of that had to do with the unusual filtering techniques.  Overall though both are part of this trend - particularly in bigger-budget American and British films - to desaturate or limit the color range that has heavily infected a lot of cinema for the past 20 years.  I think at some point some gestalt of Hollywood and British filmmakers came into being that believed that draining the color makes things more ""serious"" more ""tough"" and more ""male"" and that that's what the young male audience that is the only one that matters wants.  Nobody who counts wants to see the pastels of **Carol** or **Brooklyn,** the luminosity and richness of **Little Women** or J**auja** or **Moonlight,** or the candy-cane Technicolor of **La La Land** apparently - not in anything that's going to be on 3500 screens and gross $1 billion worldwide.  Anyway that's how it feels to me, and I'm sure there are some exceptions - and actually Deakin's work on **BR2049** would count, but I'm suspect some of that has to do with wanting to have some of the same feel as the original, which seemed muted in 1982 but is positively Wizard of Oz-like today.

And I know it sounds like I'm going overboard but I don't spend money going to movies - and that's how I still see most new movies - to see something dreary and gray all the time.  It's fine in some contexts, like I said I think it works in **1917** to have a muted, mostly brownish color palette; I think the washed-out nearly sepia tone worked in another, better 21st century war movie, **Letters From Iwo Jima** \- but when Clint went more or less the same route in a fucking musical, umm, no.  And a lot of the MCU films, and nearly all of the DC comics films have been similarly dull to me - and they're based on comics for chrissakes.  Comics which used to exist, and still do exist to some extent, to be FUN.   Isn't color part of that?  Can't it be sometimes at least?"
940,2020-01-29 19:12:02,evq5z6,"I would add also that it's obviously not just film.  Compare car colors now to what was available between, say, 1950-80 or so.  Not that I think that every Cadillac Escalade should be shocking pink or bright green, but the fact that we have taken so much color out of significant portions of everyday life seems strange to me.  It feels sometimes like there are people who think color is for kids - or for the more primitive, 20th century Americans - and we're grown up now and we all should look somber and morose and gray."
941,2020-02-01 01:07:37,evq5z6,"Well war *is* exciting from a certain angle, it often brings about rapid changes. But thinking something is exciting doesn't mean you think it is good or should happen."
942,2020-01-29 19:31:44,evq5z6,"Don’t you think a big part of that comes from the attempts at realism from filmmakers? I mean, we don’t tend to see the world in pastels or in oversaturated colors. Filmmakers have taken it too far the other direction, into desaturating things to have *less* color than we regularly see, but I don’t think it’s tough to see where that intention originated from. 

There’s also the belief, backed up by most audiences response, that the darker or more muted the color palate the more serious and deep a movie is. You see that reflected over and over again by audiences and critics. I guess until the audience response changes, muted will still equal serious and important."
943,2020-01-29 19:22:36,evq5z6,"I think you’re right and that’s a good place to look. My wife says something along those lines every couple of months, like “why are there only like 5 car colors? Everybody wants shit to look the same. I don’t like it.”

I think there’s something to be said for not translating the colors of comics directly onto the movie screen. For example, Wolverine’s classic yellow suit, which looks phenomenal on the page, just wouldn’t translate to the screen very well. It would look too cartoonish, and too many people have trouble with the suspension of disbelief for non-realistic movies as it is, no need to give them another reason, is there? I mean, even Into the Spiderverse, which looks more like a comic book than any other mainstream movie, still lost some people by looking too cartoonish...in an animated movie."
944,2020-01-30 14:13:39,evq5z6,"Oh, I think you're pretty much spot on in regard to intentions.  And there certainly is this idea that everything has to be ""dark"" and ""intense"" these days - this was definitely NOT the case when I was growing up in the 70s-80s.  I think in some ways it developed out of the punk aesthetic and a certain turning back on 60s optimism, which happened much earlier in music though it's evident in some 70s films as well.  But it didn't fully manifest until the last couple of decades - now we seem to live in an era where people want to take stuff that was fun and turn it dark and unpleasant, and leave the ""light"" stuff exclusively for the youngest kids.  And it works at the box office so it keeps happening.

I definitely don't believe bright Technicolor is appropriate for everything, or even most things - but back when it was at it's height in the 20 years or so after WWII, black and white was still a valid artistic and commercial choice.  Now we seem to make do with dull and gray-blue for nearly everything instead of the quite wide palettes that we could have."
945,2020-01-30 18:55:23,evq5z6,What you’re saying makes me wonder about the viability of having something black and white being released mainstream. Like you want dull and flat color palettes? Let’s just go back to black and white. Once you commit to that there’s a greater ability to play with light and shadow and could make for some really interesting visuals. I think Sin City might be the closest we’ll get in modern times but it still makes you wonder.
946,2020-01-30 19:10:36,evq5z6,"Well there are plenty of low-budget and independent filmmakers doing b/w - Lav Diaz is the most prominent name I can think of, also Philippe Garrel; both have done color work but seem to prefer b/w, and I'd imagine when shooting digital there's no difference in cost, which was an issue at one time.  But they aren't getting real distribution at all, and all the awards or praise they get from the cinephile community isn't going to affect what gets shown at multiplexes.

The **Lighthouse** looks to be the only b/w film that got a wide American release this year, and it grossed the enormous sum of $11 million domestically; obviously it was fairly cheap though so it probably at least broke even.  2018 had both **Roma** and **Cold War** getting some attention and a few $$$, and Sang-soo Hong's most recent film **Hotel by the River** was b/w like his two previous works - but he's never gotten distributed in the US and I don't know that his films even make money in South Korea.  The last film that was a hit on any level in b/w domestically is probably **The Artist** and before that **Sin City** (the first one, the second was a flop) and going back...**Schindler's List**?  Not many films in the past 30 years at all.

So people don't really want b/w, but they don't want their colors vibrant and bright either.  Gloomy and dull, like life."

964,2020-03-27 17:33:03,fpzdmd,"We did add a lot of players in FA, so we can almost go pure BPA in the draft. Still hoping we get an opportunity to trade down, but DG has never done it once. I wonder if the Judge was in the draft room when Belichick made it a common practice."
965,2020-03-29 01:56:05,fpzdmd,The roster can be salvaged if DG trades down and does not let his ego get in the way of building a decent offensive line.
966,2020-03-28 01:59:42,fpzdmd,"Still a lousy roster but we could improve one side of the ball a lot through this draft. I still believe Simmons is the best multiplier factor out there. Grab him and everyone around him should get better. Take a second-order OT with the second pick and turn him into a professional, competent, player by Year 2."
967,2020-03-27 22:10:08,fpzdmd,"If there was actually going to be a season this year I’d be terrified by this pathetic roster. Year to year it simply never gets better. Gettleman has proved himself inept. 
If the season is played get ready for another 4-12 or worse"
968,2020-03-28 12:19:49,fpzdmd,"my belief that the roster continues to be utter and complete garbage is reinforced by the current spate of FA signings --  DG overpays for marginal and JAG players in the vain hope that they will come here and be more than they ever were, or at least as good as they were someplace else where they were compliments to better players

this is a losing strategy because it its the rare player that suddenly becomes better in new surroundings and because we otherwise have no ""better"" players to begin with that they can at least compliment

so we have to look to the draft for those better players,  which would be fine if Gettleman could actually draft any talent outside a top-10 pick; but he can't

for the past 2 seasons, we have been forced to salivate over 2d tier players like Hernandez, Slayton and Lawrence because all existing players on the team are that much worse - but it doesn't make these second-tier players top top tier ones

and then of course there are the worse still players like Baker, Hill, Carter, Ballentine, etc., who we try to convince ourselves are starting quality guys when wee all know they should be out of the league yesterday

not for nothing we are 3-13, 5-11 and 4-12 over the past 3 seasons

truth is, DG is as lousy a GM as Reese in terms of spotting talent, maybe worse

we are now entering year 3 of his tenure and the o-line is worse than ever; which means that the offense will continue to be terrible; which means Saquon will be wasted again; and which means Daniel Jones will not develop

DG can't spot talent beyond the first round, especially outside the top 10; thus, all you can count on is the first draft pick being talented, even if not the right value pick or the right need for the team

given that every pick after our first selection this season is destined to be a JAG at best, if DG picks anyone other than Young (in a fantasy world where he's still on the board) or Simmons, then he will have blown that pick too.  although we desperately need offensive linemen, especially tackles, and despite there being a slew of promising candidates, all of those candidates won't actually pan out, and whichever one DG picks, should he go that route, is bound to be the one that fails

unless and until DG and the entire scouting department is swept aside and a ""true"" GM descends from heaven, the Giants (and we fans as collateral) are fucked

silver lining?  no season this year so for those who like to pretend, carry on"
969,2020-03-27 17:52:47,fpzdmd,Nicks was awesome. Big and strong but could glide all over the field with sneaky speed. Didn’t he get cheap-shotted and declined from there with leg injuries? He should’ve been our #1 receiver for another five or six years.

Plan A: Stay at #4 and draft the best of Simmons/Young 

Plan B: Trade down a few spots, but not out of the top 10 and take the best OT/pass rusher available

Plan C: Trade down multiple times, acquiring a bunch of draft picks, and take the best pass rusher/offensive lineman/defensive back available/wide receiver"

979,2020-03-28 17:20:06,fpzdmd,Slayton was an awesome even if unexpected find for a 5th round player.  Not sure what else you can hope for.
980,2020-03-28 15:16:35,fpzdmd,"I don’t think it’s quite this dire. I’d say the roster is mediocre. You’re right that we need to build through the draft, and we haven’t been able to do that for a decade. Until we find a way to do that or get lucky we’ll be stuck near the bottom of the league.

As far as free agency goes, I would say the moves were solid. You have to spend money somewhere and it seems like we’re taking the quantity over quality approach. Which makes sense if your roster is barren. And every FA deal could be considered an overpayment because record deals are the norm. If you told me a few years ago that we’d pay $10mil per year for a solid middle LB I would’ve laughed. But these days it’s not that crazy.

>*Crimewatch is only on BBC iPlayer for 1 day after broadcast. We always aim to offer our programmes to stream for 30 days; however for a number of reasons including technical problems, legal or contractual issues this isn’t always possible.* 

This seems to be the case for most news type shows. The same also seems to stand for the Roadshow spin-off: 

>*For legal reasons, Crimewatch Roadshow is only available for 24 hours after broadcast.*

I imagine it's a mixture of how cases evolve, the need for consent from the victims family, and monetisation issues. That's just my own speculation though. I've been trying to dig up the actual legal reasons but they seem to be well hidden. 

You may be able to find them with some intensive searching, I'd be shocked if they weren't lurking about on the web somewhere. Hope you find them though, I've been wanting to watch the missing years for some time. Those were the ones I grew up on."

I made inquiries via an old PM of mine who was the project manager of the first ever automated system commissioned by the BBC to systematically archive its output. 

Unfortunately ""its output"" turned out to mean ""part of its output"" (so the exercise wasn't systematic). That was in the late 1990s and, even now, only certain programmes are archived. There appear to be a lot more complications to do with rights issues than there were in the past :(

Taking an OT first round that can't play inside (like a Wirfs that could kick inside for year one and then back out a la Tunsil for instance) still doesn't solve the fact that we don't have anyone of talent (that we know of yet) to play either guard position while taking an OT at a position we have two at least serviceable players in. Just not a great move with the holes we still need to fill and we give up capital to do it. We could have gotten Ruiz here and stayed at 22 to do it, which would have been a significantly better move for this team than moving up for Jones IMO.

And then with a safety... I love Delpit, but assuming we keep Harris (whether because we can't find a trade partner or we do want to sign him long term, I can't read what we actually want to do with him), a safety there makes **no** sense, especially with a PERFECT fit at WR in Jefferson or that IOL help I mentioned we needed badly in Cushenberry if you didn't take Ruiz at 22. Even a CB like Fulton would have been a good fit and hit a top need for us. 

Overall, not thrilled tbh, no offense. It just failed to hit any of our fop four or five needs (IOL, DT, CB, WR, and arguably EDGE all come before OT and S comes even farther after that right now) when players that fit our systems almost perfectly while also being better fits for needs were still there on the board without us having to have used draft capital."

1042,2020-03-25 17:34:22,fotpcu,"How do you not think it is dire?

Crowder is our top option and has never cracked 850 yards in his career. He is a good slot receiver but a bad #1 option. This reminds me of when Kerley was our #1-neither should ever be a team's top option. Perriman has had 5 good games in his career, so he is a dice roll at best. Then there is absolutely no one else worth mentioning on the roster.

I think your analysis of our TE group is a classic case of overrating our own players. I am high on Herndon, but he is far from proven from a production and health standpoint. He is talented, but lets be real, he put up 500 yards in 2018, it wasn't like he lit the world on fire. Don't get me wrong, I do think he can be a weapon for us moving forward, but none of that is proven. Griffin is JAG. I'm sorry, but that is just the truth. He had a few good plays last year, but he isn't a remarkable TE and at 30, in his 7 year career hasn't done much of anything.

Bell is a great weapon. However, in today's NFL, most teams have pass catching RBs on their roster. I don't think Bell(if used correctly) can really make up for not having any WRs outside of Crowder.

> Also, who's to say either V. Smith and Berrios don't make jumps this year??

Because that just seems like wishful thinking. Nothing is pointing to that being the case.

&nbsp;

> Which is why we MUST draft a tackle at 11 at all costs.

Could not disagree more. I am also not saying we shouldn't take a tackle at 11. Both positions should be valid options at that spot for us.

I do agree the line still needs work. However, this was never a one year fix. We need both OL and WR help. This isn't a binary situation where it is one or the other. We need both for Sam. Look at the cowboys before and with Cooper. Elite line and RB, bad offense and mediocre WB. With Cooper, the offense transformed and Dak was the QB2(stat wise, not talent) on the year. Sam can't be expected to be successful with no WRs even if he does have a line. The opposite is also true. Sam cannot be expected to be successful if he has WRs and no line. If we have an elite WR sitting there at 11, I don't think it is crazy to take one. Hell, we probably need to come out of the draft with two of them.

I'd be fine with us taking on of the big 3 tackles(not Becton) at 11, but I think it is a little narrow minded to say that an elite WR at that spot is somehow out of the question."
1043,2020-03-25 17:14:49,fotpcu,"Sam isn’t even close to Rodgers, let’s not pretend like he is. Rodgers is a top 5 QB of all time."
1044,2020-03-25 17:39:23,fotpcu,"I think the common NFL fan can look at a highlight reel catch and think that a wide receiver is game changing. I think a common NFL fan can also look at a tackle not miss an assignment and just say “eh he’s just doing his job”

So at a bare bones level, I think that’s where a lot of the WR favoritism can come from. There are a lot of posters here with more nuanced and research based opinions as to why they want WR at 11 and that’s valid, but I wouldn’t get concerned about random posters on r/NFL who only follow the Jets in times of circus media."
1045,2020-03-25 19:02:43,fotpcu,Take an OT with the top pick. WR class is deep- draft someone like Aiyuk or Mims later.
1046,2020-03-25 19:09:13,fotpcu,"Ummm... Darnold has high potential, but to say he's equivalent to 2015 MVP Cam, Rodgers, and 2017 MVP Brady is insanity."
1047,2020-03-25 20:50:20,fotpcu,"the fact that you look at cam, brady and rodgers as ""qbs just as talented as darnold"" is just.. wow.. and then you even went on to say darnold's MORE talented than rodgers and cam.

what planet do some of you guys live on?

expecting sam (at this stage) to elevate the players around him like those guys is stupid and irresponsible."
1048,2020-03-25 18:16:18,fotpcu,I think the Tackles are being overrated since so many teams need them in the top 11 picks. None of them look like they will make a Nelson type impact on the other hand a guy like Juedy who has antonio brown potential can come in and change the offense by opening up space for the other good recievers on the team (herndon crowder bell)

I'm tired of BPA. Get the most talented player that fulfills a need. If that need isn't aligned with your position then trade back and collect assets."

1075,2020-03-24 16:51:29,fo6ux7,"I can't gauge the reception on Oprah's Bank Account. It rose alot, but it had to I guess. Next week gona be interesting."
1076,2020-03-24 17:57:43,fo6ux7,"All aboard the Blinding Lights hype train for #1.

Then the week after I'm rooting for Dua. She moved her album to this Friday so I'm hyped. Refuse to listen to the leak but everyone that has think it's every bit as great as hyped. She's really come into her own with this perfect rollout.

Weeknd and Dua back to back is a feast"
1077,2020-03-24 17:29:20,fo6ux7,why tf is the frozen 2 soundtrack here

1079,2020-03-24 21:35:13,fo6ux7,Bruh Uzi whole drop is charting 😳
1080,2020-03-25 00:43:06,fo6ux7,"How is OUTWEST not charting anymore, assumed it was in top 20 rn"
1081,2020-03-24 15:50:49,fo6ux7,"I haven't been keeping up to date but wow I didn't know Life is Good was charting that high, I remember looking for it like three weeks ago and there was no sign of it."
1082,2020-03-24 18:35:14,fo6ux7,Surely this is the most songs by an artist with “lil” in their name to be on the chart at the same time
1083,2020-03-24 23:24:50,fo6ux7,Who the fuck is still listening to the box???
1084,2020-03-25 16:39:15,fo6ux7,"I wonder how this chart works b/c it is super surprising that ""What's Poppin"" is only 48 considering I see that song everywhere."
1085,2020-03-24 19:14:33,fo6ux7,Uzi and Niall dropped the best albums last week imo
1086,2020-03-25 01:42:10,fo6ux7,every song in the top 5 is good except for Life is Good lol
1087,2020-03-24 16:22:04,fo6ux7,"I feel like blinding lights is special enough to dethrone the box, I wouldn’t mind it."
1088,2020-03-24 16:24:26,fo6ux7,kinda crazy how fast all the uzi songs are dropping thru the charts
1089,2020-03-24 16:39:29,fo6ux7,Easily will be Number 1. After Hours in general will crush the charts.

1092,2020-03-24 20:00:44,fo6ux7,I kinda hope it's his highest charting song that's not a feature.
1093,2020-03-25 00:52:42,fo6ux7,People really think that song is good?
1094,2020-03-24 17:52:35,fo6ux7,Blinding Lights is Def gonna go number one then hopefully In Your Eyes gets it next. It's a far shot but I could also see Save Your Tears getting it next.
1095,2020-03-24 16:17:16,fo6ux7,"Circles is bland, and this is coming from a Post fan."
1096,2020-03-25 02:26:06,fo6ux7,Circles is a top 5 worst Post Malone song OAT
1097,2020-03-24 17:59:39,fo6ux7,"I never thought I'd see it, these songs finally dropping

If Rollie was mixed correctly from the start and didn't have to compete with The Weeknd I wonder how it would do"
1098,2020-03-24 19:12:24,fo6ux7,anytime I happen to hear the radio for a lil while I feel like I hear it.. I think it's been consistently around the middle of the chart
1099,2020-03-24 19:12:23,fo6ux7,It's a terrific pop track that's been creeping up since it dropped. I hope it cracks the top 10
1100,2020-03-24 17:42:19,fo6ux7,I think relatively it's not a flop but not a big hit either. Two huge stars on it and it's still lower than No Guidance which came out almost a year ago (June 2019)
1101,2020-03-24 17:17:00,fo6ux7,"True but don’t forget a lot of Weeknd songs will chart, so 2 weeks from now may be a better representation of how the song ia doing."
1102,2020-03-24 18:15:59,fo6ux7,what producers she wrk with on her new project? def want her over some more Calvin Harris or Diplo material
1103,2020-03-24 18:00:55,fo6ux7,shit slaps
1104,2020-03-25 14:42:09,fo6ux7,Disney+ released the movie on their service three months earlier because of the coronavirus outbreak. This is the main reason the movie's soundtrack rose by 8 spots to #10 this week.
1105,2020-03-24 15:54:08,fo6ux7,It was number two for its first eight weeks.
1106,2020-03-24 17:29:24,fo6ux7,the Drake verse on it is terrific
1107,2020-03-24 23:38:13,fo6ux7,"Same, I knew that it debuted high but damn"
1108,2020-03-24 19:01:33,fo6ux7,Think it's got to be. There's 29. The week after Tha Carter V had 28 though. Doubt any other week is close
1109,2020-03-24 23:41:06,fo6ux7,"Me, shit still slaps"

1111,2020-03-26 15:30:25,fo6ux7,Yeah man that sht is trash. Only autists in tiktok are listening to it
1112,2020-03-24 16:38:11,fo6ux7,"I mean right now for Apple Music top 100 global, the box is 3rd and all the other top 10 is After Hours songs."
1113,2020-03-24 16:58:37,fo6ux7,"That's what always happens when a big artist drops and like every song from their album debuts on the Hot 100. They all fall and only the singles/biggest songs remain. 

It's unreasonable to expect 18 album cuts to stay peaking on here after the first week. Literally nobody does that.

Edit: it happened to Drake, Kanye, Lil Baby, Travis, Tyler, J. Cole, Eminem, DaBaby, X, etc etc"
1114,2020-03-24 18:15:11,fo6ux7,Idk none of them really feel like they have hit potential
1115,2020-03-24 16:32:55,fo6ux7,Cause nobody actaullys cares about them mid ass projects he dropped they only charted cause of hype
1116,2020-03-24 21:07:27,fo6ux7,it's doing really great on streaming I'm sure it's mainly that

1120,2020-03-24 18:16:23,fo6ux7,I think its one of his best songs

1124,2020-03-25 02:36:14,fo6ux7, Nice troll

1127,2020-03-24 22:03:23,fo6ux7,If it maintains until LB3 comes out it might have real summer hit potential
1128,2020-03-24 18:23:59,fo6ux7,"Not sure, but the beats have been really groovy. I definitely want to hear more of her over Calvin Harris. But the 3 singles have all been amazing. All have like an 80s groove combined with modern elements"
1129,2020-03-24 23:06:27,fo6ux7,this but unironically
1130,2020-03-24 16:07:42,fo6ux7,I'm a blind cunt
1131,2020-03-24 18:01:09,fo6ux7,Also Future's flow on that was really good
1132,2020-03-24 18:02:36,fo6ux7,but at the minimum those artists keep a song in the top 10/20 for a while.  Doesn't look like Uzi's gonna be able to do that for more than a few weeks... which is honestly embarrassing when you're an artist as big as Uzi and you drop 32 tracks. At least  a few should have popped off
1133,2020-03-24 16:36:23,fo6ux7,It’s more that Uzi is rarely chart friendly song wise.
1134,2020-03-24 16:37:21,fo6ux7,Ehh I listen to it everyday lol I got about 10 tracks out of both versions combined that I really fw.  If you ask me that drake and future song is super mid yet is top 10.  If they stay in top 100 and his streams above 40k every week then people definitely fuck with it.
1135,2020-03-24 16:45:07,fo6ux7,"It's moreso because he's not a singles artist, and his songs don't get a lot of radio play"
1136,2020-03-24 16:52:14,fo6ux7,LIR2 didn’t have a song in the Top 10 unless you count XO Tour Llif3.
1137,2020-03-24 17:58:19,fo6ux7,Nah I care about them
1138,2020-03-24 21:28:17,fo6ux7,yeah but its because it got popular on tik tok it got a second wind
1139,2020-03-25 01:51:13,fo6ux7,"Yeah I get it, but this song blows lmao"
1140,2020-03-25 16:36:41,fo6ux7,"facts, only reason why he is even relevant is b/c of quality control. smh both designer and fetty were better but they somehow fell off before yachty did, yachty has not had a decent song since lil boat"
1141,2020-03-24 21:40:40,fo6ux7,not even top 10 for him
1142,2020-03-24 19:58:44,fo6ux7,huh
1143,2020-03-24 17:01:31,fo6ux7,Read the bottom idiot.
1144,2020-03-25 05:01:41,fo6ux7,Really isn't. It's such a generic and boring song to me.
1145,2020-03-24 20:22:17,fo6ux7,Really? I didn't think there was anything notable about it. I thought futures part on that was pretty bland compared to what he's capable of
1146,2020-03-24 18:20:33,fo6ux7,What are U even talking about? This shit happens for like 90% of album releases. Usually only the big singles stick behind
1147,2020-03-24 23:49:30,fo6ux7,"P2 is gaining in streams, even though it didn't start in the top 10, it might get back up there in a while or if nothing else hang around somewhere in the charts for a while"

1149,2020-03-24 18:36:41,fo6ux7,They probably fell harder tho because uzi released a bunch of new songs so uzi fans streamed those more in place of the EA songs
1150,2020-03-24 18:38:26,fo6ux7,Lil baby Wayne Ye Da baby Tyler and Em didn’t keep a song in the top 10 for a while
1151,2020-03-25 01:56:56,fo6ux7,"really don't think going #1 for 2 weeks straight and selling 500k+ from streaming alone over 2 weeks is even close to ""embarrassing"" but go off"
1152,2020-03-24 18:12:44,fo6ux7,"or it means that everyone is enjoying all of the songs equally instead of all crowding to one, which imo is even more impressive"
1153,2020-03-24 17:40:19,fo6ux7,it's more that deep cuts don't stay on the charts. The singles do
1154,2020-03-24 17:59:36,fo6ux7,"his old music was, it's just the latest stuff just isn't good enough honestly"

1157,2020-03-25 04:16:46,fo6ux7,"Blinding Lights is definitely not a Tik Tok song. Actually I don’t think I’ve ever seen a Tik Tok with it as a sound.

Edit: I just looked and there’s only 240k blinding Lights sounds on Tik Tok. For comparison, Don’t Start Now(Number 3 on Billboard) has over 4.5 million sounds"
1158,2020-03-25 08:00:29,fo6ux7,Blinding lights is never on tiktok lol. It's a radio song
1159,2020-03-25 00:59:45,fo6ux7,What’s your top 10
1160,2020-03-25 12:50:46,fo6ux7,Alright to each their own I guess. Idk how people can call this generic there's literally nothing that sounds like it
1161,2020-03-24 21:30:31,fo6ux7,Future got the best part of the song
1162,2020-03-24 19:08:51,fo6ux7,that's his point...there are no big singles sticking rn
1163,2020-03-24 18:22:19,fo6ux7,"Didn't happen with Scorpion which had many tracks become hits that weren't singles at the time of album drop. Didn't happen with Astroworld either. Top artists generally always have at least 1 track from the album release go big. Only exception is when the album has no standout tracks which is basically the case with those 2 Uzi drops

&#x200B;

Even The Box wasn't a single until AFTER it became hot. Generally what happens is people realise what the good songs are and they get more streams than the rest of the project. Literally what's happening with In Your Eyes on After Hours rn... so much so that they've just made it a single after seeing how popular it is"
1164,2020-03-25 01:49:47,fo6ux7,Why are you only thinking short term tho?  successful albums nowadays are those with long term success.  Luv Is Rage 2 has sold over 2million because it had multiple big hits.. this album doesn't look like it has potential to hit 2m at all rn because there's nothing really popping off. Of course there's still potential for a few tracks to pop off with some good marketing but I don't see it happening tbh
1165,2020-03-24 18:41:10,fo6ux7,"so do you think songs from the 2nd project will stick up higher then?

&#x200B;

I don't think so because from what I've seen stans aren't how songs stay up high in charts. It's the regular casual listeners that keep songs up high.  I bet a very small % of people who've listened to The Box over 10 times have listened to that full album front to back.. Same with Say So by Doja Cat and even Intentions by Justin Bieber.  Even Blinding Lights by The Weeknd (tho to a lesser extent)"
1166,2020-03-24 18:45:13,fo6ux7,"You sure Da Baby didn't? tbh all of those projects have basically failed at what they were tryna do except Tyler. Especially Lil Wayne's, jesus his has flopped really badly"
1167,2020-03-24 18:20:05,fo6ux7,"Not really how it works though. When a single pops off it will be listened to by a much bigger audience than the album had, if that makes sense."
1168,2020-03-24 18:03:55,fo6ux7,an artist as big as Uzi should have at least a few natural hits from a 32 track project tho surely... not doing that is just failure
1169,2020-03-24 18:49:27,fo6ux7,"Idk man I really thought Baby Pluto, P2, Silly Watch, That Way, etc. could’ve at least been top 5 or something."
1170,2020-03-25 17:45:00,fo6ux7,If he didn’t stray so much from traditional structure (especially hooks) I would agree with you. But his sound and lack of hooks hurts his chart friendliness.

1172,2020-03-25 06:23:51,fo6ux7,"Nah I had this argument before with someone.

This album was delayed a long ass time plus it had several leaks.

Reading the release thread and general consensus: everyone has different ""favorite tracks"" similar to maybe kanye releases recently and many were begging for the sk gs on deluxe.

So my 20 out of 32 tracks and someone else's 20 out of 32 tracks might be completely different depending on the style someone prefers.

Point being that uzi pretty much released this for the fans and for the numbers.  It was a win-win plus I mean if just doesnt release the songs for another 2 years you get the following:

Potential leaks

Outdated sound

Not released at all and not getting paid for it

Another over-saturated album or he doesnt make much new music because hes sitting on too much old music. 

You see what I'm getting at?   MID is what I would call culture 2 (actually that's trash imo) or maybe drake's scorpion album or kanye's ye album (due to hype) but I give a pass to uzi for this album because he was sitting on a shitload of music."

I'm not sure how this is ""embarrassing"" when this happens to literally every big artist. When a project drops the majority of songs drop in the first few weeks"
1177,2020-03-24 18:28:01,fo6ux7,"True but with other artists the same thing happens, all song fall for 1-3 weeks and then one or two non single songs pop off and start rising again"

Stoney’s production doesn’t match up at all and the lyrics dont come close either although lyrics don’t really matter much to me. The melodies and hooks don’t come anywhere close to his later albums and the melodies are easily the best part about his music. Plus just not as consistent."
1179,2020-03-24 20:49:56,fo6ux7,ehh yeah but the album with the HUGE hype came out 2 weeks ago and I don't hear anyone talking about any one track.. nothing's really HITTING
1180,2020-03-26 12:48:55,fo6ux7,"You don't need radio play to have a hit lmao it's 2020.

The Way Life Goes 388m streams  

Dark Queen 152m streams  

XO Tour Llif3 1.2billion streams  

20 Min 165m streams 

&#x200B;

on JUST Spotify.  That makes all those tracks at least like 3x+ plat. Eternal Atake definitely wont have a hit anywhere near as big as XO Tour Llif3 and I don't think it's gonna have one as big as The Way Life Goes even..  The highest streamed song/day on it rn is P2 and that's 17th on Spotify Daily..."
1181,2020-03-24 20:15:28,fo6ux7,Fr this shit is a non-argument
1182,2020-03-24 21:10:37,fo6ux7,"That isn't really true in the streaming era.. a lot of the biggest hits in the last few years werent' even singles or had no push behind them until after they blew up. XO Tour Llif3 was put on a throwaway project by Uzi and they only made it into a proper thing after it started getting a lot of traction on Soundcloud...

&#x200B;

Same with Astroworld & Sicko Mode. Wasn't a single but it blew up from Day 1 because it was genuinely a very good song. Even The Box by Roddy wasn't a single, it came out the same day the album did and it wasn't a single until like 2 months AFTER the album came out lol

&#x200B;

This doesn't happen to every big artist whatsoever. I can name many examples of random songs releasing on albums by big artists and blowing up within the first few days. Sicko Mode, In My Feelings, Nonstop,  EARFQUAKE etc are just a few examples.. and off After Hours it's clear In Your Eyes is gonna be a hit, they've just made it a single aswell it seems"
1183,2020-03-29 23:30:45,fo6ux7,neither of you having anything from August 26th is an absolute travesty...Monte and 40 Funk are both top tier Post songs imo.
1184,2020-03-25 11:06:19,fo6ux7,That's because it's ALL hitting. People don't just recycle the same 1 hit. Most of the songs are getting replayed.
1185,2020-03-24 21:01:08,fo6ux7,"Well that's a subjective point. I've heard people talking kobe, myron, come this way, lotus, because they have anticipated them for years now. I only have been hearing people talk about uzi new album/deluxe and the weeknd's new album"

But they are too ""hip hop"" or the sound can blend with other tracks, maybe Futsal Shuffle 2020, but that song fell off pretty quickly on the charts.  As i said, not enough replayability or catchiness."
1188,2020-03-24 23:58:42,fo6ux7,just because your buddy Al is talking about the tracks doesn't mean they're big singles..
1189,2020-03-30 12:37:52,fo6ux7,"cause hits generally don't come out of thin air.. unless you add extra tracks like he did today, which could make a huge difference if 1/2 of them become a hit.  You don't need to wait a year when hits is how albums get like 90%+ of their sales tbh

&#x200B;

yeah xo tour life was added as a bonus track but so what? it's still a part of the album. The Weeknd couldn't do that with this project because he simply didn't have a hit to do it with"

1191,2020-04-12 13:07:42,fo6ux7,"kinda confused why I randomly brought up Weeknd lol

seems I was pretty right about Uzi tbh, none of his songs are doing well at all. His highest on Spotify US Daily is 28th!! with only 2 tracks in the top 50.. the project only came out  a month ago, that's so awful.  Imagine you're an artist as big as Uzi and you drop your first album in almost 3 years and fucking Lil Mosey releases a hit that out performs every track on your album.. that's a yikes

Weeknd has Blinding Lights which started doing well when the album dropped but except from that he has basically nothing still even tho he's tried... so it looks like this album isn't gonna do as well as Starboy long term"
1192,2020-03-24 15:52:48,fo43m5,"Y’know how you said you’ll whine if they take Herbert?  (I’m with you on that, btw).  That’s what I’m going to do if they take a RB in the first round.  They shouldn’t even think about RB until at least pick 70.  
One guy everyone is sleeping on is Anthony McFarland from Maryland.  Why this kid isn’t mentioned with the top 3 or 4 guys I have no idea.  Guys like him and Perine from Florida are going to provide just as much value and you can get them 100 spots later in the draft."
1193,2020-03-24 13:24:36,fo43m5,"So, all three of our 1st round OL picks were hits, and the record gets spotty from there. 

Just reinforces that we have to take an OL in round 1. Honestly that OL draft decade wasn't as bad as I thought."
1194,2020-03-24 13:18:53,fo43m5,"You put in a lot of work with this post I appreciate that.  Also thank you for the formatting it definitely makes a difference.  Great job!

But what about this is different than any of the other posts about draft needs/wants?   Most of this just reads as a stream of consciousness instead of researched and objectively put forth. 

I guess I appreciate your look back to your own posts from previous drafts but I feel that could have been a much quicker summary of your successes vs failures. 

So while I think it’s repetitive, keep the content coming.  This is the Type of stuff this sub needs instead of two line posts.   Good job."
1195,2020-03-24 13:33:37,fo43m5,I appreciate your bonafides
1196,2020-03-24 16:39:33,fo43m5,"I understand you're in love with Dobbins, but he looks so slow to me on tape. I wanted Etienne as my top choice, but he went back to school, so I've got Taylor as my top choice right now. Dobbins looks so slow on tape and constantly gets caught from behind on ""highlights"". Then he opted to not run the 40 on his pro day, which only verifies it for me. He's got to run it at his pro day and come in under 4.6.

There's no way he's 4.44 fast (reported high school time) and getting caught from behind as often as he is."
1197,2020-03-24 13:17:56,fo43m5,Thank you this was a lot of effort
1198,2020-03-24 18:04:38,fo43m5,This post could have been 1 word: Tua
1199,2020-03-24 16:15:18,fo43m5,"Dolphins need to draft a safety and theyll be in the position to draft a top 3 prospect. After free agency, we need a safety more than a pass rusher. Lets have the best secondary in the afc east. All in for Mckinney"
1200,2020-03-24 17:09:09,fo43m5,"The RB thing is tough because they are so hit and miss, and can also only provide use for a few seasons. I'm also an Ohio State fan, and McFarland was a beast against us two years ago. At the same time, since we have so many picks in the first 70, if we like Dobbins or Swift or whoever, we don't have to worry about reaching and taking one with our first pick in second round or last pick of first."
1201,2020-03-24 13:39:37,fo43m5,"It isn't - but it really gets propped up by Tunsil given his unexpected fall due to the gas mask situation.

The biggest issue with our O-linemen, is that when we've had good linemen, they've gotten hurt far too frequently. We paid LT Branden Albert as a franchise left tackle. Yet he missed multiple games all 3 seasons he was here. Jake Long, former #1 overall pick, great first 3 seasons, injuries mounted, left for St. Louis and was a complete shell of himself. 

Even in recent years - Ju'Wuan in his 5 years with us had 2 seasons where he only played 7 and 8 games. 

It seems so specific to us but I decided to look at top rated drafted O-linemen over the last 5 years.

* 2016 Draft: 1st Round, Pick #6 - OT Ronnie Stanley (12, 15, 15, 14 games w/ Ravens)
* 2016 Draft: 1st Round, Pick #8: OT Jack Conklin (16, 16, 9, 16 games w/ Titans)
* 2015 Draft: 1st Round, Pick #13: G/T Andrus Peat (12, 15, 15, 13, 10 games w/ Saints)
* 2014 Draft: 1st Round, Pick #6: OT Jake Matthews (15, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16 games w/ Falcons)
* 2014 Draft: 1st Round, Pick #11: OT Taylor Lewan (11, 15, 16, 16, 15, 12 games w/ Titans)

Comparable? You just notice when your O-linemen aren't there than anybody elses I guess."
1202,2020-03-24 17:36:57,fo43m5,"Here are the 40 times of the Top 10 rushing leaders last year.

* #1. Derrick Henry: 4.54 seconds
* #2. Nick Chubb: 4.53 seconds
* #3. Christian McCaffrey: 4.49 seconds
* #4. Ezekiel Elliott: 4.47 seconds
* #5. Chris Carsen: 4.58 seconds
* #6. Leonard Fournette: 4.51 seconds
* #7. Josh Jacobs: 4.54 seconds
* #8. Joe Mixon: 4.43 seconds
* #9. Dalvin Cook: 4.50 seconds
* #10. Marlon Mack: 4.50 seconds

So I 100% get what you mean about him needing to get under that 4.60 mark. I still love what he could contribute for us in the passing game - as for Jonathan Taylor... a few things worry me. He ran at Wisconsin, and while Dobbins and most other RBs at elite schools are running behind NFL-talent offensive linemen, Wisconsin is kind of known as being an O-lineman factory. **He fumbled 15 times in 3 years.** Dobbins fumbled 5 his whole tenure. 3x as many - and that's not an issue that just gets resolved with ""he'll be coached to hold the ball better"" - some dudes just innately are riskier with the ball and it's hard to tell them not to run a way they have their whole life. 

He's fast as hell - I get why some would be enamored with him, but if Dobbins comes back slow I'd rather sit back and take a RB in the mid-rounds."
1203,2020-03-24 15:55:08,fo43m5,"Dude, how can you forget Mike Pouncey. Did he play a full 16 games once for us?"
1204,2020-03-24 18:57:10,fo43m5,"Oh nice list. Looks like I need to update it to 4.55 or better. \^_^

Taylor definitely worries me with his fumbling, but I feel like other players have fixed it in the past - but I can't think of anyone off the top of my head.

I'd definitely be interested in snagging Cam Akers later or AJ Dillon.  That dude is a beeeeeast!

Also, if we miss out on someone this year, because another prospect falls and he's worth more to us than an RB, I'd be fine rolling with an UDFA and grabbing Etienne early in the 2021 draft."

1224,2020-03-23 23:34:22,fnueps,I feel like neither of the Browns’ moves in the 1st make sense
1225,2020-03-23 23:38:33,fnueps,I'd be pretty excited if Isaiah Simmons fell to the Broncos. In the 2nd round I'd prefer Bryce Hall over Terrell
1226,2020-03-23 23:39:16,fnueps,"The panthers have 2 decent LTs right now, we don't need to pick up another.  Outside of IOL, our offense is pretty solid in terms of starters.  Meanwhile, our Defense is a complete wreck.  If we don't go with Simmons, I think we're much more likely to take Brown or try to trade back (and hopefully still take Brown).  

And dear lord I hope we don't try trading up in the third for a QB again, Grier was enough trouble."
1227,2020-03-23 23:53:12,fnueps,There is no way the Panthers take an OT in the first after drafting a LT in the 2nd last year and trading for one in the offseason.
1228,2020-03-23 23:54:12,fnueps,This is one of the more reasonable mock drafts I've seen however there could be a run on trades in the 6-10 range imo but that's hard to predict
1229,2020-03-24 00:10:44,fnueps,"If this is how the boards fell, i'd be a happy camper.

Jags taking Taylor? I'm going to assume that they move Leonard Fournette. OBJ being traded for 2nd rounders? That is spicy, the Browns trade though really does make no sense. They gave up more to get him, so they'd want fair/equal compensation in return."

He was the most natural and technically sound LB in this entire draft class imo.  He didn’t perform at the combine though so I’m kinda knocking him down a little bit for that but a great Pro Day puts him in the running for the first true LB off the board.  I think he’s arguably the best LB in this draft class because of his instincts and coverage ability but Murray flies around the field so well just fearlessly attacking that I don’t think anyone goes ahead of him.

Packers send 2.62 and 4.136 for 2.57 and 2021 6th.  Packers relentlessly try to move up for this tackling machine but I don’t think any of the teams ahead of this spot can be persuaded to trade down.

1231,2020-03-23 23:39:22,fnueps,"Honestly an extremely poor draft from the Ravens. 2 developmental EDGE players - neither of which capable of contributing as pass rusher day one (which is what we need from an EDGE, we have run stuffers in spades), 2 developmental OL, and a RB. Our biggest issue, ILB, isn't addressed at all despite Queen being on the board at 28, and we passed on the strongest WR class is a long time complete through three rounds.

I like Niang, but with both OT positions locked down with no chance of him having a shot any time soon, the second is far too early for us to look at that position.

This would be a pretty terrible haul for us, honestly."
1232,2020-03-23 23:41:03,fnueps,Also you messed up the trade up for Cesar Ruiz and it says bears and browns in the post. Also browns own 2.41 and bears own 2.43 and 2.50.
1233,2020-03-24 00:09:06,fnueps,"I don't see us drafting an RB or S over a CB considering the loss of Trufant, presence of Neal, Allen, and Kazee, and the addition of Gurley, though Brown at 16 would be an absolute steal"
1234,2020-03-24 00:15:36,fnueps,"This draft is terrible for the Bucs. We don’t need CB one little bit and here we take not one but two in the first 3 rounds. Our pass defense was pretty good the last third of the season, with our starting 3 corners all being either rookies or second year players (Carlton Davis, Sean Murphy-Bunting, and Jamaal Dean). By drafting two CBs this high, you’re either giving up on 1-2 young promising players or using 2 premium picks on luxury depth. 

As of now we need desperately need RT and IDL and it would be catastrophic if we don’t get at least one of those positions in the first 3 rounds."
1235,2020-03-24 00:43:14,fnueps,"I appreciate the effort brother, these mocks aren’t easy to do. But I absolutely hate this draft for the Raiders. If Juedy and Lamb are both gone at 12, and Simmons is still available I would puke if we took Kinlaw. DT is the one position where we’re both young, skilled, and have depth. Then we double dip at DT in the 3rd? No thanks. 

I’m ok with the Gladney pick, but if causes us to give up a 2nd and 3rd to panic and take Pittman? Gross"
1236,2020-03-24 00:44:50,fnueps,"I will add just one thing one your blurb about the falcons and their draft pick.  I would be excited if Brown fell to the Falcons, but the LB are just as much at fault in the run game than the DL.  And probably even more.  Deion Jones is uber athletic, but his instincts in the run game haven’t taken that next step like I thought it would at this point.  Also last year Campbell was more worried about arguing with falcons fans coming at him on Twitter than improving so him leaving will only help even though he leaves the depth there very thin."
1237,2020-03-23 23:53:32,fnueps,As a Dolphins fan I would not be happy with that trade to get Tua.
1238,2020-03-24 00:11:20,fnueps,"There’s also a zero percent chance we trade Odell now. If that was gonna happen, it would’ve happened shortly after Stefanski was hired."
1239,2020-03-23 23:51:21,fnueps,If you think Becton and Troy Dye are bad picks idk what to tell you except watch tape of them.
1240,2020-03-23 23:42:18,fnueps,Yes I think he messed up the Ruiz one and meant Bears. But also has the browns taking Lamb at 10 and then spending a third rounder on Duvernay which is even more confusing.
1241,2020-03-23 23:41:29,fnueps,ODBJ is traded to the Eagles for two 2nd round picks and that’s why Lamb is selected.  No blue chip OT prospect means they take the BPA that fills a need.
1242,2020-03-23 23:46:32,fnueps,The eagles traded their #85 to the Lions in the Slay trade.
1243,2020-03-24 00:25:55,fnueps,Did you miss the part where the Jags signed Schoebert
1244,2020-03-24 00:53:40,fnueps,"Jalen hurts and Tua? Man, the quarantine doesn't mean you can recklessly do drugs"
1245,2020-03-24 00:15:06,fnueps,I’d say there’s always a chance but it would have to be a haul not 2 2nd rounders.
1246,2020-03-24 00:26:51,fnueps,"Becton is fine. A 1st round RB? And whose job is Dye taking, Joe or Myles, two LBs who they just paid? Who is playing corner or defensive tackle?"
1247,2020-03-24 00:00:04,fnueps,"Jonathan Taylor ad Becton in the first lol. are you joking? first off most said that no RBs should go in the first. second JT is probably RB3 in this draft behind swift and dobbins. they will prob go Andrew Thomas/Kinlaw/Brown in the 9th pick. and with 20th, Kenneth Murray/Xavier McKinney/ Delpit/ CJ Henderson."
1248,2020-03-23 23:44:19,fnueps,"That makes more sense, but I agree with your reasoning on the WR stuff. Plus passing on Simmons makes no sense to me."
1249,2020-03-23 23:47:45,fnueps,"Yeah OBJ isn't getting moved for less than they paid for him. 1st, 3rd and promising player is the minimum the Browns are shipping him off for. Now if you said Philly is sending Dillard, 21, and one of their 3rds this might be a different conversation."
1250,2020-03-23 23:42:30,fnueps,"I saw what you did but I don’t think they would trade him for that, and I also don’t think they’d trade up for Cesar Ruiz like that."
1251,2020-03-23 23:56:32,fnueps,You’re right that should say “Lions”
1252,2020-03-24 00:21:53,fnueps,"Yep his market might not be what we traded for him, but we aren’t gonna move him for less than that. A 1 and a 3 is the bare minimum we’d take"
1253,2020-03-24 00:35:54,fnueps,"Becton is not that good. hes overweight and the only reason hes mocked that high is 

1) his weight

2) his 40 yard time

his film is mediocre. hes a mediocre pass blocker."
1254,2020-03-23 23:45:24,fnueps,I could see them going receiver only if Simmons and the tackles were gone. But just hard to pass up on a player who can impact our defense in so many ways.
1255,2020-03-23 23:54:12,fnueps,">Yeah OBJ isn’t getting moved for less than they paid for him.

He’s getting traded for as much or more than what the Browns gave up for him?  I respectfully disagree."
1256,2020-03-24 00:13:24,fnueps,There’s literally a better chance that I get drafted by the Browns than the Browns trading up for a guard that high. This is arguably the single worst mock I’ve ever seen for Cleveland
1257,2020-03-23 23:46:18,fnueps,"Right, this WR class is so deep that they can afford to take one with their fancy extra 2nd rounder."
1258,2020-03-24 00:01:13,fnueps,The browns are happy with him and Berry has repeatedly stated he's not trading Beckham. You're not trading someone like Beckham for 2 2nds when Stefon Diggs got a 1st and some change. 2 2nds would be a laughable trade.

1265,2020-03-23 22:57:45,fnts50,wow never thought that saying “if you’re happy about a pandemic you are a trash human being” would be controversial
1266,2020-03-23 23:01:56,fnts50,"okay but you are totally not taking into account the struggles that people face outside of their own homes. the same things that you may find enjoyment in they hate. the interactions which they have to face from day to day they may despise. yet you are totally inconsiderate to that. and the ""happy about a global pandemic"" shit isnt true lmao. im pretty fucking sure if you asked any introvert if they'd rather have or not have the virus affect the world, they'd not want it to. also theres tons of shit that could be equated to that. you enjoy cheaper products from companies that violate human rights and kill thousands in third world countries that barely insure workers any protections. just so you can pay cheaper prices. your argument can be equated to literally anything lmao you dont have to be such a dick about it"

Politics has a lot to do with that. Celebrities are mostly liberal, so they're hated by the right, yet they're also filthy rich in an economy that suffers from growing inequalities, so they're a dark omen for the left.

He saw the Wall shining like blue crystal, and his bastard brother Jon sleeping alone in a cold bed, his skin growing pale and hard as the memory of all warmth fled from him. And he looked past the Wall, past endless forests cloaked in snow, past the frozen shore and the great blue-white rivers of ice and the dead plains where nothing grew or lived. North and north and north he looked, to the curtain of light at the end of the world, and then beyond that curtain. **He looked deep into the heart of winter**, and then he cried out, afraid, and the heat of his tears burned on his cheeks.

The 25 year old that I live with now is just ridiculous. I lived with someone my age once and she was insane and not paying rent. I called her mom hoping for some outside reasonable adult perspective. Turns out the 20 year old immature nut job was raised by the 50 year old immature nut job mother. 
I’ve decided that 9/10 roommates don’t work. Too many people are gross and immature. Not worth the gamble"
1321,2020-04-21 19:19:58,g5dpne,"Wow I thought these were maybe younger adults who were just starting out on their own. Not that it makes the behaviors ok, but it would make sense at least. The fact that they are practically middle aged adults and act this way is unfortunately probably a sign they're set in their ways and don't care. I guess since you seem to have the support of your other housemates I'd suggest coming to them as a group and confronting them together. Maybe it they here it from more than one of you they'll get a hint. Probably doubtful though. Sorry and good luck"

You want to cook something and their in the kitchen squatting, tell them to get the fuck out and cook your food.  Stop being so nice at this point, you've tried that route and nothings come of it.  It's time to start fighting fire with fire. 

Honestly the one part of this that really struck a nerve with me was the issue with your plants haha.  I love gardening but one thing everyone knows is DON'T MESS WITH MY PLANTS.  Thats where my self control would have abruptly ended with these two and mistakes would have been made (I know, weird thing to be my trigger with all the other stuff you mentioned but I've accepted this aspect of my personality long ago haha).  

You've shown crazy amounts of patience through this and you shouldn't be expected to continue doing so.  Its time to get all the other roommates involved as well and tell these two garbage people to cut the shit or get the hell out."

When I told them in somewhat disbelief that it is mine and I have the receipt to prove it if necessary they continued to say I was lying and stealing....

I made a complaint to the landlord agency and they said they would have a word with them..  I'm viewing a new room completely separate from all that is associated with this property tomorrow afternoon."
1324,2020-09-26 00:28:12,g5dpne,"Without the final say in the matter, and legally being on the same level as those schmucks, I would say that being aggressive is a really good way to an all out war. 
That couple sounds like they are stupid, obnoxious and unaware of how toxic they are, by showing how annoyed they make you feel, they will feel totally justified by upping the ante in retaliation. Not a great way to de escalate the situation. 

Some people will never understand how horrible they are to live with, and though it would be tempting to destroy everything to do with them, burn their lives and maybe leave them stranded in the woods with no phones or music players or lighters... it's technically you who would be creating more conflict, and people like that will make damn sure that it looks like you who's starting the fight.

The only way is clear, open, non aggressive confrontation, spelling out in no uncertain terms what is and isn't acceptable behaviour, and open communication with the agency and other housemates. If everyone else really hates them, and they alone keep breaching the contract, then they can be evicted. it's possible but unfortunately it is just easier to move away from that hot mess."

1328,2020-04-23 07:52:54,g59az2,"They needed someone ""slutty"" to place all these characters into moral quandaries and offer a barometer for their own encounters. The irony is, personalities aside, they all sleep with A LOT of men."
1329,2020-04-21 13:02:00,g59az2,"I actually view each of the characters' personalities and views on relationships as phases in maturity (not necessarily for the better).

&#x200B;

1) Charlotte is the idealism of youth and inexperience.  She is fully bought in on the fairy tale

2) Carrie has a few lingering moments of the childish idealism while moving into the next phase of relationship understanding, self-absorbtion and ego as a motivator.  The belief that anyone would be lucky enough to have her, and that she doesn't need to change to make it work - they do.

3) Miranda moves into the next phase of relationship belief, ""there are no good men left"" and through trial and tribulation, she's finds strength and stability in her professional identity and puts less effort into her romantic identity.  She simply doesn't want to squander her time and attention on something not fruitful.

4) Samantha is the last phase of relationship belief (from a single person's perspective), that all relationships are sadly transactional, and to protect oneself from pain and discomfort, keep things to the lowest common denominator and treat men (or women) as a hobby.  She's clearly been so hurt and damaged moved through the previous phases that she isn't interested in letting anyone close to her, except to serve her appetite for a good ""workout"".  elf-protective and selfish, she has reconciled that her life may really be spent alone and thus, returns to the self-absorption/ego moment in the Carrie phase but throws it on a 10.  

&#x200B;

Re-watching this series during quarantine has been a super interesting exercise for me.  I was roughly 26 when it first aired and now Im roughly Big's age. Upon first airing I was all about Carrie - thinking all men were doing her dirty and she deserved better.  Now at 45, I am fully sympathetic with Big and how overly needy, self absorbed, and ego driven Carrie is and after his frequent attempts in telling her (in different ways) that he was not interested in the type of commitment that she so ideated, he finally finds someone easier to be with (Natasha).  We all know how it ends - you cant deny love and chemistry - but Big put up with a lot of Carrie's nonsense - frankly more than I would have."
1330,2020-04-21 10:30:04,g59az2,I used to love Samantha but I realized she cannot carry a conversation and none of her scenes show her doing anything non sexual. She’s obnoxious and she does come across as more of an addict than a woman who unabashedly enjoys sex.
1331,2020-04-21 14:20:51,g59az2,"Are we getting these threads every day now instead of ""Carrie is awful""."
1332,2020-04-26 20:36:40,g59az2,"Thank you! I made a post about this and a lof of people didn't agree. I can't really understand why we can't face that some things have not aged well.

I remember when I was young I thought she was so cool because she was presented as empowered. In reality she needed approval from men. She even said charlote should let her boyfriend pee on her because uf ou really like the guy, you should. That message (obbviously not just from the show) really messed me up because I though I had to force myself to do thing I didn't want. I thouagh that's how you become free and liberstwd or whatever. It's not. It causes a lof of problems that I spent years working through."
1333,2020-04-21 11:11:22,g59az2,"Points 5-Sam Jones, the student, sexually assaults and stalks her! She had every right to be dismissive of him. He turns up at her apartment, and kisses her and forces her on the bed, when she's given zero indication that she likes him. 

Point 7- Agree 100%. She was racist. Also, reverse racism does not exist (for those who want to claim that the sister was 'racist'). The 'big black ass' comment was horrific. As was the 'I don't see colour' comment.

What you have to remember is, that the girls are meant to be archetypes. So not all of their behaviour is supposed to be taken literally."
1334,2020-04-21 06:37:01,g59az2,[deleted]
1335,2020-04-21 18:47:56,g59az2,"I appreciate this comment and this perspective, thank you for adding it! But I still disagree, I don't think Samantha represents the ""last phase"" more than they all represent different philosophies on love/marriage, with Charlotte being the most conservative, Carrie being the eternal Scarlett O'Hara (the parallels are endless and I think its clear this is what the writers were going for with her character), Miranda being the cynic, and Samantha being the spinster (but instead of making her stereotypically ashamed of it, they make her proud).  


I don't think Samantha represents the last phase of relationship belief from a single person's perspective because its too static and objective to put this on her and doesn't correlate with her desperation to be attached to another man or her jealousy over the men she dates. The characteristics she has outside the bedroom are still abhorrent and obnoxious and if they were on any friend of anyone's they would throw them in the trash. I think her being hurt and damaged to the point where she uses men and gets mad at her girlfriends for being open to men or flat out abandons them comes across more of a Mrs. Havisham brand petulance and less or a ""take no shit"" type of woman."
1336,2020-04-25 03:04:03,g59az2,"Point 7 - so it’s ok that she told her to get her little white pussy away from her bro, but big black ass is a problem? Reverse racism is such an idiotic term. If you comment on anyone’s race in a negative way it’s racism, always, across the damn board."
1337,2020-05-27 03:04:04,g59az2,"The sister was definitely racist, she had a problem with her brother not dating a black girl. And her comment was absolutely uncalled for, same thing with Sam’s comment. When she said “I don’t see color” she didn’t mean it as actually not seeing race but as seeing everyone the same way. The sister started the race comments, but it’s only wrong when Sam makes them out of defense?"
1338,2020-04-21 06:42:03,g59az2,"I’m not going to touch numbers 4-7, but as for 1-3, those were really revolutionary to have on TV for a female character at the time. Samantha’s character was an incredibly big deal to have on TV."
1339,2020-04-21 09:01:39,g59az2,"Countering 4. First - reverse racism isn’t real??? And furthermore Samantha says other racist stuff on the show “this isn’t chillin’ at Snoop Doggs’ crib”????? Also even if reverse racism was a thing is she 11 years old? Mommy, he hit me first so I get to be a racist ???? Jfc she’s 45 years old. Charlotte understands how an eye for an eye make the world blind. This isn’t an excuse it’s a shitty person 


7. Um not fulfilling someone’s emotional needs is not the same as not fulfilling someone’s sexual needs. This philosophy is demonstrated on the show: The politician isn’t sexually fulfilled by Carrie, he leaves her, HES portrayed as the asshole. When Charlotte won’t perform oral she’s considered ridiculous until they break it down: it shouldn’t be the only thing of importance or even the breaking point in a relationship. Guy breaks up w her, she leaves, he’s portrayed as a creep who sexually abuses his dog because he’s so desperate for oral that if he doesn’t get it he’ll commit beastiality. This is basic common sense - not willing to give someone sex (and it’s not even like she’s refusing everything, she’s sexual, she just isn’t enabling what is clearly an addiction) isn’t the same as not communicating. You can have a happy relationship without a blowjob you cannot have one without communication 
I’m not debating that further because if you honestly open that door you’re opening a door that leads to sexual and emotional abuse. 


6. Why does that matter at all???????????? She knows these men are married and sleeps with them anyways. This isn’t empowerment this is hurting another woman because she can’t sleep with someone single? Seriously? 


5. They could have developed story lines for her earlier but they couldn’t because her character sucked. Charlotte and Miranda got massive plot lines early on. There’s nothing with weight you can do with a character who’s only trait is their sex addiction 


3. This isn’t a debate in relative morality. I understand she doesn’t like kids. Charlotte is jealous and upset that she can’t have kids and she doesn’t take it out on her. Carrie doesn’t like kids but sucks it up anyway. This isn’t how you treat a friend. Samantha acts like a baby about her friends child because it’s not what she likes? How selfish is she? She took care of the kid out of pity and guilt - which she should rightfully feel and after she realized her behaviour was what makes a bad friend. Same w Charlotte and the underwear. 


She literally did take shit from others she got back with Richard because she liked him and wanted him and only after it physically caused her discomfort did she leave 


She got back together with Dominic as a means of playing him - thus giving him what he wants - and she immediately got attached and then he played her. This is taking shit from someone else
Her being a bad friend isn’t “taking shit” none of her friends try to walk all over her, they’re dealing with their own problems, she disagrees with it and instead of being a good friend like they are to her and realizing she has a different value system but loves them regardless, she dumps them or insults them


You can’t in one sentence say “she has a different value system” and in the next “i don’t see charlottes problem with her sleeping with her brother.” She was uncomfortable with it, period. You don’t get to decide the appropriate for another person to be hurt so that you can do what you want to do without carrying responsibility or guilt. Also tonnes of people would have ended friendships over this, tonnes of people would have been made uncomfortable with this. I don’t really care about what you think about it it’s an objective discussion about her performance as a friend and a character and this is a dog shit thing to do. 


Charlotte wasn’t just upset about everything she forgave Carrie when she cheated on Aidan, she forgave Samantha when she had that drink and slept with her brother, she gets over her resentments quickly and deals with situations extremely well (confronting bunny, confronting trey, saying what she’s sexually comfortable and uncomfortable with, confronting big in the first movie, and she does all this without throwing a temper tantrum !!!! Because she’s an adult !!!!)


1. as I said she gets attached to men insanely easily (Richard, Smith, Dominic, James, she gets way too attached to all of them way too fast and gets insanely jealous over their behaviour) she literally breaks down like a toddler because James’ penis is small. Imagine if a dude did this like literally started crying because his girlfriends pussy was loose? The complaint itself be hailed as misogynistic but to cry in a bathroom about it??? Like we’d call this man King Baby until the end of time. She was like what? 41? Seriously if you wanna argue it’s a fantasy fine but none of the other girls or their friends have this behaviour 

2. Samantha does see sex that she wouldn’t do as bad. When that Texan woman gives a dude a blow job under the table she leaves and its insinuated that Samantha thinks it’s classless and gross. So Samantha clearly has a measuring tool and doesn’t view all sex as empowering and then she insults and distances herself from this woman even though THAT woman isn’t ashamed. Why is it cool when Samantha does this (including doing sexual stuff in public) but when this woman does it it’s cause for removal ? She’s totally hypocritical

Miranda and Samantha have the same politics around sex and yet nobody gives Miranda her tens like they do Samantha. So samanthas character being “ahead of the times” seems like it’s more a filler character then breaking barriers or whatever because Miranda does that and Miranda isn’t a fuck freak dunce and actually has a life outside dick which is much more realistic to how promiscuous women are and not a caricature of a promiscuous woman as drawn by Hugh Hefner"
1340,2020-04-21 09:02:39,g59az2,*to the tune of Andy samberg saying “doesn’t matter had sex” in the lonely island song “I just had sex”* doesn’t matter still sucks
1341,2020-04-21 11:20:23,g59az2,">And furthermore Samantha says other racist stuff on the show “this isn’t chillin’ at Snoop Doggs’ crib”?????

She also wears that afro wig, and makes a comment about being like 'Foxy Brown' or something."
1342,2020-04-21 18:30:51,g59az2,idk how posts about Samantha being a racist are getting down voted..... how are you going to say you're progressive in one sentence but then in the next disregard women of colour's experiences.....?
1343,2020-04-21 19:17:56,g59az2,"It's disappointing. 

We often talk on here about the problematic aspects of SATC, and the episode where Sam dates Chivon is usually talked about as one of the worst and most offensive episodes. 

Sam, well the writers, said some pretty offensive things.

And Michael Patrick King, the show runner, wrote that 2 Broke Girls show, that has a lot of offensive racial jokes.

Personally Fiona’s music isn’t for me, but I can see why everyone on this sub loves it. Hopefully he reviews it well! But on the other hand, SAWAYAMA is definitely my AOTY.

1374,2020-04-20 13:09:01,g4m0xt,"I don't think you can really quantify things like that. But two reasons I think it ""deserves"" a 10 from fantano. He gave the Idler Wheel a 9, and this album is, imo, an improvement on all fronts. The Idler Wheel is a great album, but drags at points. There isn't a boring song on Bolt Cutters. And the other reason is just that I have yet to hear a reason for disliking the album that I think he would really take into account. Now, there's no accounting for personal taste, but given that he's already obviously a fan of hers, I'm hopeful.

Personally, it's a great listen, it sounds sharply original, it's withstood my endless replaying so far, every song is memorable and distinctive, it comfortably covers a wide range of emotions without ever feeling disconnected. It just feels like it achieved everything it set out to, and those goals were worthy and ambitious. If accessibility isn't a criteria for a 10, then this doesn't have much to knock it down."
1375,2020-04-20 12:59:01,g4m0xt,"I think that besides the album being really fucking good the lyrics and context(sexual abuse,feminism,mental health,etc.) surrounding it really define the era we're living in, it's very much a 2020 album in the best way possible."
1376,2020-04-20 18:26:34,g4m0xt,"I've never really connected to or cared about fionas past works but Bolt Cutters absolutely broke me. One of the most viscerally emotional albums I've heard in years, it transports me to her exact head space. It's so completely polished and masterful but still totally raw and crazy, it's kind of an astounding album to me. Absolutely a 10/10 in my book. It made me sob my eyes out the other day when I listened to it (though I admit that was also related to something going on in my personal life)"

As for what was represented? Nothing surprising. A middle of the road concert of middle of the road performers singing comfortable and recognizable songs so that the intended audience (people with money to spare for donations) was made at home.

1409,2020-04-19 18:41:23,g4cujx,Musical taste is subjective and there is no wrong answer when it comes to what your favourite music is. Your boyfriend playing the guitar since he was nine does not make his opinions on music to be more valid that anyone else's.
1410,2020-04-19 18:49:23,g4cujx,"If you can have the maturity to respect his music taste, he needs to grow up and respect what you like. His dismissive behaviour is honestly disrespectful.

If he comments again, you need to ask him in no uncertain terms to respect it, and also would it kill him to pretend to be happy for you and what you like?

EDIT: sorry, forgot he was an ex, but this goes out to all media snobs x"
1411,2020-04-19 19:01:58,g4cujx,"The biggest issue here is that he's a music snob and he's judging you for your preferences, that's not okay."
1412,2020-04-19 20:19:39,g4cujx,"he's pretentious and immature, but he's also your ex so it's time to let it go."
1413,2020-04-19 20:36:47,g4cujx,"I have  similar experience with this with my ex. He only loved metal and I liked hard rock, pop, and a bunch of different genres. He belittled my music taste towards the end of our relationship and truthfully although it was like three years ago I still have some insecurities when I show others my music. I was able to somewhat over come it by sharing music with people I am very close with. Close friends and family who I know would respect my music even if they didn’t like it. If I were you I’d slowly start sharing your music with those you love, when you discover a new song send it to your BFF! You have to build the confidence back and it will take time. Your music taste matters and like others have said so far, don’t let a music snob ruin your music! You own your music and love it!! Hope this kinda helped and I wish you luck with gaining confidence again!"
1414,2020-04-19 21:20:59,g4cujx,"This did help, thank you :) it’s nice to talk to someone else who has been through it. Music is a big part of my life and it sucks when someone you cared about basically took a big shit all over your music taste. Whenever he would bring up songs or artists I would always make a genuine attempt to listen to them and see if I liked them but he never once did the same for me. Sometimes I wish he could’ve been as excited for my stuff as I was for his. I’m just gonna focus on myself and finding someone later on in life who will at least respect my music taste even if they don’t like it."
1415,2020-04-19 18:46:52,g4ct1v,"Well 1st of all I'm glad he's your ex because he sounds like an obnoxious elitist jerk!

You don't ""yuck"" someone else's ""yum"". It's their right to love something that you may not personally be into, so don't be a jerk and don't be belittling!

 It's the equivalent of saying that since *your* favorite color isn't *my* favorite color,  your color sucks. How ridiculous is that? 

I would dismiss his choices and ideas, because you're letting his opinions overshadow yours. You like what YOU like, and forget what anyone else says.

I hope you don't dwell on his opinions. You are free to love what you love, like what you like, enjoy what makes YOU happy.

Did I mention, I'm glad he's your ex?"
1416,2020-04-19 18:39:49,g4ct1v,"Sounds like a bit pretentious. Sounds like he discards music because it falls into a certain genre. Good music is good music regardless of what genre it falls in. I used to be like that in my early 20's where ""pop"" music was shitty just because it was ""pop"". Now I love the songs that I love. Don't care who sings - or what genre it is. Sounds like he's just closed minded"
1417,2020-04-19 19:35:43,g4ct1v,"This is like reading about every relationship I’ve had and every time it’s been a massive thorn in my side. Do people exist that will just let me listen to my music the same way I make space for theirs.

Edit to add: sucks to be them missing out on the joy you get from singing your favourite songs, keep doing you some people put more effort into feeling superior than enjoying their life"
1418,2020-04-19 18:39:46,g4ct1v,"Lots of people who like different music e.g. older music try to make it a bragging point because supposedly they’ve put effort into finding this music and developed a different taste than is currently popular. While I love classic rock, it’s not the only right music genre and it’s not better than anything else. You need to realize that his subjective opinions about music don’t have a massive impact on how you perceive your music. It’s all subjective"
1419,2020-04-19 18:44:31,g4ct1v,"Music is one of the most personal tastes there is and liking something someone else might despise doesn't make it worse or better.
Simply don't ever ask him about his opinion on music anymore. He obviously doesn't respect you enough to really listen to it and be interested in it because you like it. Even if someone doesn't like your music, they still will listen and not shit all over it because it's not about the music but about you sharing what you love and that should be all that matters."
1420,2020-04-19 19:17:04,g4ct1v,"I've been drumming for 20 years and playing piano for even longer. I play in punk bands primarily but some days I just need some top 40 too! Anyone who is judging you so much for what you like is either delusional about how cool how music tastes are (I mean I dig the stuff he does too but there's nothing inherently interesting or unique about liking it, as is the same for pretty much other forms of music) or is speaking from a place of insecurity. Keep enjoying whatever the hell you want!"
1421,2020-04-19 21:25:49,g4ct1v,"I’m glad that’s something that changed for you, being closed minded about that. Among our other issues that was always something that really bothered me about him, but it just shows he didn’t even care/respect me enough to even attempt to like my stuff. I tried to wait to see if he’d change but it got exhausting."
1422,2020-04-19 21:27:36,g4ct1v,Yeah he literally thought he was so cool when he would talk about it and bring up how all the new music nowadays is “shit” and no one makes “real” music anymore. It was ridiculous.

It doesn't help you're selectively ignoring successful/unsuccessful QB's at the other end of the spectrum either.

Basically what that plot supports is the average score lies in a middle range, but even the outliers on the high/low spectrum don't have any different AV than those on the other end.

Also as I mentioned, Tua has a lot going right for him that some of these other QBs don't have.** But he did not do himself any favors with that score, and if he was under the false impression that a low score wouldn't raise a red flag for some teams, he was sadly mistaken.

Emphasis mine. Care to respond to that? The point of the post is that while much can be read into with regards to his score, there are exceptions too notable to completely write Tua off. Teams should maybe pause a bit but he still has significant upside.

That's my point, your data doesn't present anything to suggest the wonderlic has to do with processing downfield. Theoretically if it did, those on the higher end of the spectrum would be more successful on average since that's a key factor of QB play. Additionally, if rushing ability helped cover it we'd see those on the upper spectrum with that ability perform ahead of their lower wonderlic counterparts since they don't have a deficiency to cover.

>And again that chart means nothing unless you where the running QBs lie. That’s not to say that running QBs tend to have a lower Wonderlic, just that the supplement of the ability to run helps elevate QBs who struggle on the Wonderlic.

All your data tells me is that the lower scoring wonderlic QB's who have been successful, have largely been black. There's more of a correlation to socioeconomic factors than actual ability to process/read the field."

The one thing I really love about OP's post is it ignores sacks count as rushing yards in college football. So arguing that he has ""no rushing ability"" when the average NFL QB and the average point in that plot sits around 100-200 yards on the ground is hilarious.

Would you also say that among those QBs who are running QBs and were running QBs, a larger majority are represented by the list I gave than by the other seven “pocket passer” QBs?

I mean I could dive in and show that a larger percent of the population defined as “mobile” QBs becoming starting QBs despite low Wonderlics, but it just would be a ton of work that I’m not willing to do just to have more people criticize it because they don’t like the result. 

And again, you’re missing the point. Josh Allen has the ability to rush, as does Russell Wilson, Dak Prescott, and Marcus Mariota. They all scored well on the Wonderlic however, saying that they have or have not been successful in the NFL means little because they are known commodities who had high Wonderlics and got the opportunity to start. 

The only population of interest are those who scored low on the Wonderlic, AKA below average. If they have a rushing ability they are put in to column A, if they don’t they’re put in to column B. Tua falls in to B and those individuals find success much more rarely than those who can supplement their game with their ability to run, because of processing or not."

They have no ability to interpret what they read if the conclusion isn't aggressively spelled out for them, and even then, like this post, if it's after a couple of paragraphs half the people don't even get to the end before deciding to bitch.

Probably because ""rushing QB"" is a vague expression without any defining metric in his post. Nor does he really provide any sort of ""evidence"" other than pointing at a subplot of older QB's with those scores, ignoring that guys like Marino had poor wonderlics as well and guys like Allen scored highly but are horrendous passers.

The score doesn't correlate to a strong passing performance that wouldn't require rushing ability to make up the deficit. If he really wanted to make it stick, he wouldn't be turning a blind eye to the tens of QB's who scored ""above average"" or >20 that were horrendously bad passers like Nathan Peterman or the many journeyman/busts in that bracket. The score correlates to nothing.

>Nothing you've posted refutes the point of contention that low wonderlic QBs tend to fail without high mobility.

Nothing posted by OP supports the point that low wonderlic QB's won't succeed without high mobility. It's literally got more AV in low wonderlic QB's than it does in high wonderlic QB's. 

You're looking at a linear regression of multiple years of QB's with a correlation coefficient of -.11. It's not my problem you don't understand statistics.

Weird considering;
1) It's part of my job.
2) You haven't explained why it's irrelevant. Please do tell. I would love an understanding how 100-200 more rushing yards than causes a significant variance

Usually you should provide data otherwise. Seems like you're skipping any sort of analysis here other than a sentence.

Given the fact you just committed another one by insinuating I don't know anything about statistics and didn't provide any underlying evidence to support your point about *why* the data is irrelevant, i'm pretty sure i've got a better grasp than you.

2) LOL at ""no ability to critically think"". Apparently blanket statements with no data and arguing ""no ur wrong"" is critical thinking ability for you.

>You posted a thread about wonderlic and AV. Nothing to do with the point that OP's argument hinges on. Try to keep up.

AV takes into account player performance; made up of rushing and passing ability.

If you wanted to refute the linear regression, you would argue there's a correlation with the wonderlic and passing performance. As such, those on the lower spectrum would make up that deficit through rushing ability. Alas, you didn't and there is no such correlation with the wonderlic and passing AV either. Ironically, controlled for Lamar, you still see a correlation of pretty much 0.00.

What the plot basically shows you is the vast majority of players score in the middle and that there's no benefit or disadvantage to scoring higher or lower than the average."

1492,2020-04-19 18:39:03,g45w6s,Very cool!
1493,2020-04-20 01:17:20,g45w6s,Appreciate you for starting a subreddit like this! I’ve always been looking for one that’s about music writing and journalism

1496,2020-05-03 18:02:57,gcrt5o,"What I would venture is Brits seem to like their sadness more straightforward, stripped down, and unfiltered. American pop has a lot of sad songs but the sad messages tend to be wrapped up in a more upbeat style. Summertime Sadness, Dancing on My Own, Sorry, and Bad Blood all convey similar themes as Someone Like You, Little Things, and You’re Beautiful but the styles couldn’t be more different. Brits seem to want to slit their wrists over their sadness, Americans want to dance to it."
1497,2020-05-03 23:06:40,gcrt5o,"Those British you mentioned are also more charismatic than say Kris Allen, Trent Harmon, Scotty McCreery. And they release better and more mainstream songs."
1498,2020-05-04 02:05:18,gcrt5o,It’s just bad management of the people who come out of idol. Alejandro would’ve been a perfect fit for modern mainstream music fitting into similar categories as post Malone Billie eilish lauv etc but just mismanagement led to him not flourishing

1543,2020-05-02 19:21:53,gc7zf4,That should be an escape valve not Option #1 or else there’s no point playing the game at all. I may have run it in total about 20 times during all 75 games.
1544,2020-05-03 00:24:33,gc7zf4,Most of the teams had the best available cards in the game at the time. That was the highest LeBron.

I’m still on spotlight sim, but just played All star a clippers. Lou, Kawhi, And PG were basically draining everything. 20-80% covered was not working. They had 10 point lead going into the 4th.

1565,2020-05-01 18:33:55,gbmtkq,"Holy wow, this had a lot of work put into it, awesome and super helpful as I've been trying to broaden my music outside of the US.

Japanese Breakfast is definitely my current favorite musical project out there, highly recommend all her work to anyone who hasn't heard it yet. 

I'm not done working my way through this list, but here's a couple more artists for whoever is interested:

* **SASAMI** - [Really solid indie-rock debut](https://open.spotify.com/album/5dJhE07Jbhdg8wj3ysnT7H?si=Zz0OHsG0Ta2hUgM4x3q3ZQ), also is the former synth player in Cherry Glazerr
* **Lexie Liu** - Chinese artist, a sort of hip-hop/r&b type thing with [Meta Ego](https://open.spotify.com/album/1ON6zUsWnFa7nlo5YbDkoD?si=HU31ZhqiQduikLqE9_jniQ), which I liked
* **Lee Bada (이바다)**, Korean R&B artist, fantastic record last year, [The Ocean](https://open.spotify.com/album/2FEQU7BTSsYncVAg244A55?si=cww2FMr7RXaj_mmjA45vvw)
* **Otoboke Beaver** - really sick[ all-female punk band](https://open.spotify.com/album/0A7dXsu3QAMbs2Wu0FUdF4?si=bEnRZ9OHQXqI6h2Df6fLmw) from Japan
* **Qrion** - Really solid House/Deep House DJ/producer from Japan, I've been loving  [all her stuff recently](https://open.spotify.com/album/03ZLi3ZFad1jYhw8eq35qm?si=9ouKk-6vR9aYGZZ7_1t4Qw)
* **Lim Kim** - a Korean artist, who apparently used to be a Kpop artist, but I first heard of her from her ridiculously good electronic/hip-hop ""comeback"" EP, [Generasian](https://open.spotify.com/album/3qtOtUcdfFRVzHoCQLrHQo?si=uJD0saGmQbuj2uu4eQb72A)"
1566,2020-05-01 18:16:58,gbmtkq,"Your posts never fail to impress, Ghost-Quartet! 

OMG Tata Young, Thai legend - she sang the lyric “*people think it’s intimidating when a girl is cool with her sexuality*” in **2004**! A feminist and sex-positive icon. 

As a SEA person I’ve always been jealous of my Pinoy/Pinay PopHead compatriots because so many Filipinos seem to be able to break into the music industry in the US compared to us Mainland SEA countries! BTW I would add Saweetie and Maliibu Miitch to your list as they’re both Filipino as well!"
1567,2020-05-01 18:55:19,gbmtkq,"Allow me to represent my country, the Philippines. 🇵🇭

I am not necessarily the biggest fan of this band but I believe they have huge international appeal and if they play their cards right, they could be famous worldwide. This would be a huge win for OPM (Original Pinoy Music) and the Filipino community (and you know how Filipinos get really excited when one of them gets famous LOL).

**Ben&Ben is a folk-pop band from the Philippines**. A band of nine members, it's lead by two brothers Paolo Benjamin and Miguel Benjamin Guico. The band started in 2015 as The Benjamins (because Paolo and Miguel have the same names) before changing to their current name.

They were signed to Warner Bros. Records Philippines for two years (2015 - 2018) before switching to their current label, **Sony Music Philippines**.

They're hugely successful in the **Philippines** and in the Filipino diaspora. They even had a movie called LSS (Last Song Syndrome) which used Ben&Ben's music as musical numbers. They even played as supporting characters because the band played a critical role in the plot!

When I said the could be famous worldwide when they played their cards, it seemed like they were starting anyway. They became the first Philippine band to play at **Clockenflap Music and Arts Festival** in 2019. This was big news because they were basically sharing the line-up with Halsey, Lil Pump and Mumford & Sons. They were even scheduled to perform in **SXSW** this year but the whole festival was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. Recently, they performed a beautiful virtual concert in which they planned to raise P5 million in donations to help our frontliners here.  

**Some of their popular songs to check out:**

* [Pagtingin](https://youtu.be/P5ktQh3sWZk)
* [Kathang Isip](https://youtu.be/daZoiEGyFgg)
* [Sa Susunod na Habang Buhay](https://youtu.be/yB2J6kXxJIY)
* [Maybe The Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC_uJXpsYC4) I would argue this is the band's signature song but fans of Ben&Ben can disagree with me
* [Their cover of Bread's Make It with You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4HD6aC4Wos)
* [Doors,](https://youtu.be/RHoz72OOsZE) which is their latest song. Ben&Ben said that this is their first ""international"" song"
1568,2020-05-01 20:42:18,gbmtkq,"Sarah Bonito is only half-Japanese, so technically extremely underground and unknown pop star Charli XCX could qualify too, seeing as she's half-Indian. u probably haven't heard of her but u should check her out /s

but for real, great list. big fan of a few of these names (yeule in particular released one of my favorite albums last year), but plenty I've never heard of. some other API artists I like/love:

* Jai Paul - British-Indian - glitchy, gorgeous future-R&B/pop - somewhat of a modern, underground pop legend - [Str8 Outta Mumbai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUjCcHbUjo) or [BTSTU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PgYTG66j7k)
* Nosaj Thing - Korean-American - chill, subtle futurebeats - has worked w/ Grimes, Kendrick, Chance, Kid Cudi, etc. - [Aquarium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdmk3748tLo) or [Try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC1g1aZ6wMo) (ft. Toro y Moi)
* Toro y Moi - half-Filipino - groovy chillwave/psych-pop/indie rock - was instrumental to the rise of chillwave - [So Many Details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0_ardwzTrA) or [Run Baby Run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7qR1aOKgQ4)
* Thaiboy Digital (Thai-Swedish -  ethereal cloud-trap) - friends w/ Yung Lean & a member of Drain Gang - [IDGAF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QJYc36AjbI) or [Bentley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82CdItoh_lQ)
* CHAI - Japanese - indie-pop/dance-punk - groovy tunes & great live shows - [CHOOSE GO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoCOh2r6ML0) or [I'M ME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-aKOc5nN2c)
* Susumu Hirasawa - Japanese - a whole lot of genres, from post-punk to prog-rock to art pop (according to Wikipedia) - musician/composer perhaps best known for his anime soundtracks (e.g. Berserk, Satoshi Kon's stuff, etc.) - [The Girl In Byakkoya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21JuYIPHMF8) or [Run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJY1TomgkBs)"
1569,2020-05-01 19:26:42,gbmtkq,"Awesome write up! I feel like Asians are underrepresented in the music industry so this post will be a great way for me to find some new Asian talents. You already got a ton of the artists I was thinking of but here are a few more ~~(I'm terrible at writing music descriptions so expect to see the same few adjectives over and over)~~          
        
Beabadoobee - she was born in the Philippines and raised in the U.K, and she makes awesome music. Her first EP Patched Up and everything before that is more acoustic-based, while the Loveworm and Space Cadet EPs are more rock influenced. She has a really light and pretty voice and her lyrics are awesome too, she's super talented and great.           
         
Conan Gray - he's half Japanese (born and raised in the U.S. tho) and if you couldn't tell by my flair, he's my absolute favorite artist. His debut album Kid Krow was released a bit over a month ago, and it has a blend of synthy bops, rock-influences songs, and simple acoustic tracks. He writes most of his music himself, and he lots of great, personal lyrics. I really love him and his music.           
            
UMI - she's half Japanese and half black, and she makes great, chill r&b music. She has a soft, calming voice and great lyrics and production. She released a great EP a bit ago called Love Languages that has music videos that tell a story to accompany it and a track in Japanese to honor her heritage.               
         
Holyveins - she's a really underrated Filipino-American artist who makes lots of simple, nice, acoustic based songs. Her emotional lyrics pair with her light voice and simple production to make really enjoyable music.              
          
MISO - she only has one (excellent) song on Spotify so you'll want to go to her [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/misomusic) for most of her music. She's a South Korean artist who makes excellent r&bish chill pop kind of music. Her production is understated yet beautiful, and her voice is smooth and relaxing.           
         
Sobs - they're a Singaporean indie rock band that makes great music. They pair energetic sounds with often melancholy lyrics (for example, their song ""Vacation"" manages to say ""emptiness is killing me"" in a great and happy way) , and the frontwoman Celine Autumn's cheery voice ties it all together.           
                   
tiffi - She's half Chinese, half Taiwanese, and born and raised in Australia. She's only 17 but very talented, she has a mix of chill pop kind of stuff and acoustic based songs and they're all great. Her lyrics are really good, she wrote her song Peppermint Smiles when she was about to turn 13 and it's very emotional and confessional."
1570,2020-05-02 00:03:39,gbmtkq,"Nobody has said M.I.A. yet? She's the first brown woman I ever saw in pop culture, at a time when the only other famous South Asian in the U.S. was Apu from the Simpsons. Paper Planes is always going to be a moment for me. 

I think it's sad that South Asians are still so not present in American culture, especially because in an ""API"" month it's never South Asians that get considered. This list is amazing, but also if you read it it's like 95% East/Southeast Asian, which is not at all the fault of the person who wrote it because it's just that there aren't that many big musicians who are South Asian. I hope that changes. I want my kids to grow up with music idols that look like them."
1571,2020-05-01 20:31:17,gbmtkq,"Kish Bashi, a Japanese-American indie singer and violinist known for his use of loop pedals, and storytelling lyrics. He has 4 studio albums.
My personal standout tracks are:

[Manchester](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9Msybt6RQY)

[Atticus, in the Desert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcptWjmXOdo)

[Philosophize in It! Chemicalize With It!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2KMS8HA_ss)

1572,2020-05-01 19:24:56,gbmtkq,"**Kina Grannis** (pop) is one of the earliest YouTube musicians to make it big. In terms of original music, she's probably most well-known for her song [Message From Your Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV1u5QrqUHM), which was featured as a Super Bowl commercial. That aside, her cover of Can't Help Falling In Love was used in the [wedding scene from Crazy Rich Asians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipgt1MnQni4).  
  
Some of my favorites by her are [Winter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C96ZQQaGofQ), [In Your Arms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOu0DuxFAT0), and [Without Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7mAMIcCvAo).  
  
**Vienna Teng** (pop/folk/who knows) is probably one of my favorite artists of all time, due to her musician chops and awesome lyric-writing. She excels in writing catchy songs in strange keys and time signatures. See: [Harbor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss7aFUbwzec), which has verses in 5/4, choruses in mixed meter combining 6/4, 3/4, and 5/4, and a bridge in 7/4 ending in 4/4 all while being catchy as shit.  
  
Her lyrical approach is pretty rad and she can pivot from making the mundane sound beautiful, to controversial or strange topics sound palatable. Some of my favorite examples of both include:  
  
- [1br/1ba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlw5pEtF8jU), which is a song based on apartment listings in newspapers and Craigslist  
- [Recessional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGKicxfFtsw), a love story written in reverse. Includes this amazing description of falling asleep at an airport: *""In the terminal she sleeps on my shoulder. Hair falling forward, mouth all askew. Fluorescent announcements beat their wings overhead: 'Passengers missing, we're looking for you.' And she dreams through the noise, her weight against me. Face pressed into the corduroy grooves. Maybe it means nothing, but I'm afraid to move.""*  
- [Watershed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ah1_K0qeqUc), a song written from the point of view of Mother Nature explaining natural disasters to the human race.  
- [Passage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiMsI5ZZ-qg), a song about a family recovering from the car crash death, written from the point of view of the victim."
1573,2020-05-01 21:33:45,gbmtkq,"For legends: Faye Wong is a C-pop legend who's also gotten some acclaim in the west. Shiina Ringo for Japanese art/noise/jazz pop. Ryuichi Sakamoto, Joe Hisaishi, Nobuo Uematsu--all Japanese composers and musical pioneers.

For mainstream: Anderson .Paak is part Korean, and Chad Hugo of The Neptunes is Filipino.

Personal favorites:

* Haru Nemuri: Japanese, high-energy art pop, noise pop

* Wednesday Campenella: Japanese, hip house, some experimental electronic stuff

* Ichiko Aoba: Japanese, folk

* Etsuko Yakushimaru: Japanese, has done OP/EDs for some of the more artsy anime, also the vocalist for indie pop outfit Sotaiseiriron

* Snail's House/Ujico*: Japanese, future bass, downtempo, bitpop, very prolific

* Organ Tapes: British Chinese, does heavily autotuned ambient pop/R&B/cloud rap/dancehall/generally experimental stuff

* Peter Cat Recording Co: Indian, jazz pop, sophisti-pop

* Phum Viphurit: Thai, indie pop, pop soul, part of 88rising

Could go on forever, particularly on the Japanese front."
1574,2020-05-01 18:17:39,gbmtkq,"Beautiful post, as always ! My favourite API artist (K-pop not included) would probably be [Teresa Tang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv_cEeDlop0) for personal/sentimental reasons, as I'd listen to her since I was young thanks to my parents and she shaped a lot of my music tastes growing up"
1575,2020-05-01 21:13:16,gbmtkq,"The US has Mitski, the UK has Beabadoobee, in Australia we have [**San Mei**](https://youtu.be/KtRQFTyhZZg). She’s half Chinese-Malaysian but she’s based in my hometown of Brisbane. Her sound is very indie-pop with a touch of dream-pop; [her latest EP *Cry* came out about a month ago.](https://open.spotify.com/album/2m4MhEMlWoeXP1mk4t1ed4?si=ChchDgCtR_KJNA3dcHkf2Q)

Also from Brisbane are [**Last Dinosaurs**](https://youtu.be/EqGs36oPpLQ), an indie-pop band with two half-Japanese members. They’ve released three albums so far, the latest of which is [very Strokes-inspired.](https://youtu.be/QOF5lfFspaU)"
1576,2020-05-01 19:29:08,gbmtkq,"this is an amazing list and writeup, thank you for this!! I'm definitely going to check out more of these artists.

I also want to add a few notable up and comers:

**Beabadoobee (indie rock/bedroom pop)**: her feature on Death Bed is blowing up rn but her solo stuff is mostly like a mix of Clairo, Jay Som, and Frankie Cosmos. Her last two projects were really really good!!

**keshi (moody pop/bedroom pop)**: he has a nice voice and a rly great evening sundown vibe. lots of R&B influence in his music too."
1577,2020-05-01 20:29:16,gbmtkq,"Fantastic list and information! I'd like to add a few names here who aren't necessarily my favorite but I think also deserve mention today: 

Jay Sean: Y'all definitely remember ""Down,"" but he's still putting out some good stuff.

Norah Jones is still doing stuff too.

And finally, Riz MC aka Riz Ahmed, whose latest project [has a couple bangers on it](https://open.spotify.com/album/7bhh6bvHq7hqc2VQFgrwE5)"
1578,2020-05-02 07:07:24,gbmtkq,"What a great list! I now have many new artists to listen to!!

I also have some musicians to add:

* **Freddie Mercury:** Y'all know who he is lmao

* **Head Phones President** is a Japanese metal band; their specific subgenre seems to be [alternative/nu metal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76w5eSRPbNA). Anza has a melodic singing voice that popheads may enjoy, especially with nu-metal sounds being featured in pop music as of late

* Evanescence's current guitarist **Jen Majura** is of German-Thai descent. Their upcoming album *The Bitter Truth* will be the first straight up rock album from Ev to feature her on guitar. 

* Natasha Khan, the woman behind **Bat for Lashes**, is of British-Pakistani descent. Her sound is best described as kind of indie/dream pop.

* **M.I.A.** is iconic. Her family fled to the UK to escape violence from the Sri Lankan Civil War. Her music is experimental hip hop/dance

* **Karen O**, most well known for fronting the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, is of Korean-Polish descent. She's got kind of an indie rock/art punk thing going on.


If you guys would like to know more rock/metal musicians, let me know!!"
1579,2020-05-01 18:57:38,gbmtkq,It's kinda sad how most of the mainstream ''Asian'' artists that sing in English are almost all half-Asians and barely even identify with Asian.
1580,2020-05-01 18:48:23,gbmtkq,"As far as hip-hop goes, I'd definitely add Bambu and Geologic (both ethnically Filipino) and Rich Brian (Indonesian)."
1581,2020-05-01 20:47:38,gbmtkq,"Thank you for dedicating this amazing post for API music! <3

I wanna contribute a little more on top of these artists that are mentioned in this post, so check them out too!

* **Priyanka Chopra (Jonas)** \- Known for being the missus of Nick Jonas, even though her role as a musician is more of a side gig than her main one, she had released a few singles under her belt! Here are the songs that she collaborated with [will.i.am](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjgq6-5uDtY), [Pitbull](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPhhZg9v9NU) and even [the Chainsmokers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6IxATppGF8)!
* **Jay Chou** \- He's one of the most famous singer/songwriter/rapper for the past 2 decades in Taiwan, even more than Jolin I'm sure. All his [Top 10 songs in Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2elBjNSdBE2Y3f0j1mjrql?si=rcvARg1_TfGjpxsQYvaX0A) have at least 10M streams. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDo3ySyHSI) is one of my favorite of his, and also check out his [latest song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK7SPnGSxLM) as well!
* **Eason Chan (Cantopop / Mandopop)** \- If you had watched *Together at Home* livestream few weeks ago, you might had noticed this guy's presence. Eason is currently one of the most prominent singer in Hong Kong now. Dude had started his career all the way back from the late 90s, but had only achieved as the top tier musician around the late 2000s. Personally think he's great in slow songs / ballads. [These](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NJVNkzhJM4) [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3gb7qGFGMg) [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsFQ9kbpQhw) of my very favorites of his that I recommend to hear.
* **Jacky Cheung (Cantopop / Mandopop)** \- Same as Eason, he was in *Together at Home* livestream as well. He's well known as [one of the Four Heavingly Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantopop#1990s:_Four_Heavenly_Kings_era) in Hong Kong since the 90s (the other 3 are Andy Lau, Aaron Kwok and Leon Lai). In terms of vocal performance, Jacky is known among C-pop music industry as one of the best ever, hence the title ""God of Songs"". Dude is an [award-winning actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Swordsman_(1990_film)) and he has [musical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow.Wolf.Lake) as well! If he lives in USA he's probably already an EGOT winner. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgu25QSnzw0) is one of his most well-known song among his discography, which had even covered by Danish band [Michael Learns to Rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbLT12eg-lw)! [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jPMAqvxr1c) [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2twQsCQJNA) [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9lzzCvW28k) other of my favorites too.
* **Namewee** \- Here's the lesser known one, but I think he deserved to be heard more! Initially known for [cover Malaysian national anthem in bad taste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negaraku#Modified_into_a_rap_song), this [controversial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namewee#Detention_and_arrest) comedian-rapper has become one of the most interesting musician in Asia. While some of his earlier stuff are leaning towards Malaysian theme, he had since making music that are in many styles and multicultural. You name it, [Japanese style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhGnuWwpNxI), [Korean style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lqudPRnJWM), [Thai style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwZMS-ISbH4), [Vietnamese style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD_g8Yb3b4Q), [Indian style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls2SQqSgzAg), [reggaeton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRwxfYlgG-M), all while singing / rapping in Mandarin or in English... He's arguably the most eccentric and unique musician in C-pop industry right now. Also, check out [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIF8xvSA0Gw) which is his most popular song, and [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXLBNJUOU5w) where he mocks the reality singing competition."
1582,2020-05-01 23:15:06,gbmtkq,"Love these recs! OP covered most of my recs but I'd like to add **Run River North** and **Raja Kumari**.

Run River North is an indie folk-rock band. My favorite songs are [Monster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hA1bxkMQr14), [Let Me Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfFnHZWTiR8), and [Lying Beast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sUXMl09RkA)

Wonder Girls -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYGODWJgR-c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYGODWJgR-c)  \- Why So Lonely  
So sad they disbanded shortly after this masterpiece.

Although I'm only quite familiar with artists from the Philippines and some of the popular mainstream/indie acts in Americe; the past year, I've been trying to expand my pallette and, boy, did it bring me to Yuna. Later, I might edit this comment to spotlight some more Filipino artists unmentioned, as they're the ones I'm most familiar.

EDIT: Welp, I just realized that all of the artists I had in mind were in the comments, and that aside from Jay Som, I do not know any other Filipino-American hitting it in the music scene in America. So thank you for compiling this list."

I wanna rep Beabadoobee and Jay Som, both definitely more rock-inflected (although in very different ways!) but great artists who dabble in poppy sounds."

At least in the mainstream music industry though I think the element of ""racial ambiguity"" kind of helps. We saw it pretty recently with the whole Bruno Mars blackfishing scandal and how many people thought that Bruno *was* black, or artist like Dinah Jane/Nicole Scherzinger who have found success with an ""urban"" aesthetic. The stereotype of an Asian person is someone with pale skin so (and this is just my theory) darker skinned Pacific Islanders often have more room to avoid some of the stigmas that chase other Asian performers. Obviously there's people of all shades from the Philippines but that's just my two-cents."

Loved that the soundtrack of that film and how it was devoted to showcasing Asian artists. Also, love the weird early days of YouTube where artists could blow up by posting covers and releasing adult contemporary singer-songwriter bops, it was such a golden time we didn't appreciate.

I have a friend who keeps posting about Vienna Teng (they LOVE her song [""Blue Caravan""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OXNjXEV5hI)) so this gives me an excuse to listen to her."

My mom had a theory that Filipinos did well in music because their English is better than the English of people from the mainland, so when they sing music in English they aren’t accented. I wonder if that plays a part."

I prefer music that's melodic or cinematic feeling, so a good place to start are the *Aurora*, *Blue Limbo*, and *Byakkoya* albums. *Virtual Rabbit* is a good one too with ""Bandiria Travellers"" (v. beautiful) and ""Clear Mountain Top"" (fun). *Sim City* has some nice tracks mixed with some grating ones. *Hen-Gen-Ji-Zai* and *Totsu-gen-hen-i* are more orchestral if you're into that."

What is striking about the use of royal/""messianic"" language in certain places in 2nd/3rd is that it is consistently redeployed to apply to the people as a whole rather than to a specific messianic figure. It is striking that in the only passage to mention David, the covenant with Davidic is explicitly reapplied to Israel (Isa 55:3). As Ben Sommer shows in *A Prophet Reads Scripture* this is just one of many examples of previous prophesies predicting a coming Messiah being reformulated to be about the people, some of which you cite. This is, in fact, one of the most striking things about 2nd/3rd Isaiah's view of the eschatological future: in contrast to Jeremiah and Ezekiel (and 1st Isaiah), an actual Davidic king plays no role in the expected future."

What does that have to do with 2nd/3rd Isaiah? My point is that your whole analysis has missed what is fundamentally going on in Isa 40-66 with respect to Messianic expectation. In the context of a prophetic literary tradition that largely includes an ideal davidic king in its expectations for the future, Isa 40-66 reinterprets those expectations in a variety of ways in order to exclude a Davidic messiah. To coin a term, the data you've put forward actually points to a *de-messianizing* of eschatological future. To argue otherwise is to erase what is one of the most distinct theological feature of Isa 40-66.

I don't have Sommer's *A Prophet Reads Scripture* handy, but I'll quote from his intro to the book of Isaiah in the JPS study bible, 1st edition, p. 783: 
>Like Isaiah, Deutero-Isaiah looks forward to the dawn of a new era, but one no longer senses any expectation that a descendent of King David (or any other human being, for that matter) will reign as king in the rebuilt Jerusalem. Rather, God alone will rule over all creation in that day. Thus Deutero-Isaiah believes in a messianic era, but not in a personal Messiah."""

Yeah and none of this refers to the relevant description. In Isaiah 53 The suffering servant who is, after all, the subject in question, is referred to in the past tense. You're doing a lot of tap dancing to make a claim that doesn't hold up."
1736,2020-04-30 18:26:54,gaxd1u,"> Contemporary thought isn't important??

Not really since the claim is that the non-Messianic future is one of the things that makes Isa 40-66 unique. Comparisons to contemporaries are here useful precisely to the extent that they show this distinct difference: more or less everyone else speaks of a coming Messiah *except* 2nd Isaiah. This tells us something important about 2nd Isaiah.

>Westermann, someone who holds to exactly the same point you do with regards to 55:3 holds to a individual for Isaiah 53

I would tend to agree it is an individual or a remnant in Israel. What is most clear is that it is certainly not an expected Davidic King. 

>If he holds to Israel being the servant, than of course he will come to this conclusion.

He comes to this conclusion on the basis of an in-depth study of the allusive poetics of 2nd Isaiah one of the results of which was the demonstration that previous messianic prophesies are reinterpreted to be about the nation at large. It is not just that Isa 40-66 is silent on a potential future Messiah; it actively rewrites prophesy to exclude one."

>> In response to that common Christian interpretation, several points are important to make:

>>It is to be remembered that the prophets of the Hebrew Bible are not predicting things that are to happen hundreds of years in advance; they are speaking to their own contexts and delivering a message for their own people to hear, about their own immediate futures;
In this case, the author is not predicting that someone will suffer in the future for other people’s sins at all.  Many readers fail to consider the verb tenses in these passages.  They do not indicate that someone will come along at a later time and suffer in the future.  They are talking about past suffering.  The Servant has already  suffered – although he “will be” vindicated.  And so this not about a future suffering messiah.
In fact, it is not about the messiah at all.  This is a point frequently overlooked in discussions of the passage.  If you will look, you will notice that the term messiah never occurs in the passage.  This is not predicting what the messiah will be.
If the passage is not referring to the messiah, and is not referring to someone in the future who is going to suffer – who is it talking about?  Here there really should be very little ambiguity.  As I mentioned, this particular passage – Isaiah 53 – is one of four servant songs of Second Isaiah.  And so the question is, who does Second Isaiah himself indicate that the servant is?  A careful reading of the passages makes the identification quite clear: “But now hear, O Jacob my servant, Israel whom I have chosen” (44:1); “Remember these things, O Jacob, and Israel, for you are my servant” (44:21); “And he said to me, ‘You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified” (49:3).
The book of Second Isaiah itself indicates who the Servant of the Lord is.  It is Israel, God’s people.  In Isaiah 53, when the author describes the servant’s past sufferings, he is talking about the sufferings they have experienced by being destroyed by the Babylonians.  This is a suffering that has come about because of sins.  But the suffering will be vindicated, because God will now restore Israel and bring them back to the land and enter into a new relationship with them."
1742,2020-04-30 19:59:59,gaxd1u,"> The one making the claim in Isaiah 41 is God 

Nope. It is the author saying that, but the issue is the suffering servant in Isaiah 53

>  Isaiah 53 says that the servant might see offspring.

The **offspring** wouldn't be the suffering servant described by Isaiah."
1743,2020-04-30 19:11:37,gaxd1u,">What I am using Zecheriah for is that in the time period in which 2nd Isaiah was written, messianic hope was alive and well, so one would be keen to find such a thing in 2nd Isaiah somewhere.

This is not how historical comparison works. Contemporaries disagree as much as they agree. You seem to want to plot Messianic expectation on a kind of linear continuum, but again this in not how ideas work. The fact that a contemporary expects a davidic king tells us nothing about what 2nd Isaiah expects. 

I don't think it is at all controversial to claim that 2nd Isaiah lacks Messianic expectation. I cute Sommer because he gives a fairly definitive account of what is going on. A reading that insists on finding Messianic expectation in the servant songs where most would say it is absent looks suspiciously apologetic."

Isaiah 42:26 uses past tense saying no one has foretold, no one announced. Verse 27 continues in past tense and then changes in ""Behold, here they are"". Don't we see past and present tenses in these verses? I think these questions are germane to the question if you say it is all past tense."

Blenkinsopp would agree that there is no reason to see a king in that passage. When all the evidence points away from Messiah, it's hard not to suspect that a strained argument that lo and behold finds a Messiah is connected to history of this texts reception rather than a contextual exegesis of the passage itself."
1752,2020-05-01 02:55:33,gaxd1u,"If Isaiah is written after Babylonian captivity and Isiah 53 is reflecting on the destruction. Why does Isaiah talk about Tyre's destruction in chapter 23. Verse 10 says ""This harbor is no more"".  As I understand the harbor is on the island. I thought Nebuchadnezzar did not conquer the island. So Isaiah would be writing about something that didn't happen. Ehrman says that many Hebrew prophets were speaking about their own time and not hundreds of years in the future. This is true, but Isaiah is bursting with the notion of a Messiah and future prophecy in general. To say the only prophecy about the Messiah must have that word nearby in order to include it into Messianic prophesy is a stretch I think. Many of Isaiah's prophecies seem to mix past and present tense together. I have shown a few. The pronuons are important in understanding who the servant is. And I would argue chapter 53 points to a single servant. In addition I would point to those earlier verses I stated. ""That, if he made himself an offering"", ""that he might see"" ""he shall enjoy it to the full through his devotion"" and not because of his devotion"

If it was after Israel returns to Israel ch. 53 is either about someone in the past or prophetic writing that came to late to be prophetic. I have heard a Rabbi say that chapter is prophecy about the Jewish people, so it isn't just Christian's who make this claim. I would imagine a similar claim has been made by a Muslim. So if Israel decided to write a fake prophetic book after their return why did they add such an obvious lie that Tyre is destroyed. You would have to hide this book of prophesy from everyone or else your book is proven a fake. Chapters 42 and 53 are both considered by Christian's to be about Jesus. In these chapters the pronoun of the servant is he, his. Outside of these chapters wherever a servant is mentioned the pronoun mentioned is you or they. So to me when I see a pronoun used in the singular I assume it is one person. If that same document uses ""they"", then I think they are differentiating between the two. When I see the use of you as the servant I think that represents who the audience of Isaiah was meant to be, Israel. I showed previously about past and present text used in prophecy and being on my phone makes it hard to look up. But to paraphrase God asks who noticed in past tense and later on God says behold here they are. Showing that past tense is used in conjunction with present tense in prophecy. Making it possible that even though most of 53 is past tense it still can be a future prophecy."

Nothing here about the future. Isaiah is writing about **his** past,

>>For he grew up before him like a young plant,
    and like a root out of dry ground;
he had no form or majesty that we should look at him,  nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.
3 He was despised and rejected by others;
    a man of suffering[a] and acquainted with infirmity;
and as one from whom others hide their faces[b]
    he was despised, and we held him of no account.

>>4 Surely he has borne our infirmities
    and carried our diseases;
yet we accounted him stricken,
    struck down by God, and afflicted.
5 But he was wounded for our transgressions,
    crushed for our iniquities;
upon him was the punishment that made us whole,
    and by his bruises we are healed.
6 All we like sheep have gone astray;
    we have all turned to our own way,
and the Lord has laid on him
    the iniquity of us all.

>>7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted,
    yet he did not open his mouth;
like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,
    and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent,
    so he did not open his mouth.
8 By a perversion of justice he was taken away.
    Who could have imagined his future?
>> For he was cut off from the land of the living,
    stricken for the transgression of my people.
9 They made his grave with the wicked
    and his tomb[c] with the rich,[d]
although he had done no violence,
    and there was no deceit in his mouth."

But either way... The possibility of rookie Hakeem and Jordan paired with 2nd year Drexler... Jesus."
1780,2020-04-30 00:15:49,gagrih,Lmao what a horrible trade for Portland that would have been. But don’t worry they drafted Bowie over Jordan instead.....smh. Oh and that wouldn’t be the only time they’d pass up on a generational talent for an injury riddled center
1781,2020-04-30 00:33:38,gagrih,"Unpopular opinion: Houston made the right call.

The ceiling of the twin towers was huge.

They beat Showtime in their second year and only lost to the best iteration of those great Celtics squads.

If Sampson hadn't gotten injured, one would expect them to continue to improve as they aged into their primes.

Likely win both of Detroit's chips and maybe even more."
1782,2020-04-29 20:48:27,gagrih,That team would legit just win every year for a decade lol
1783,2020-04-29 16:54:10,gac73c,I think you are underestimating the cost of Judon and Stanley.
1784,2020-04-29 16:35:17,gac73c,2022 😬
1785,2020-04-29 17:02:48,gac73c,It seems inevitable that Judon is gone in 2021 and Orlando Brown Jr in 2022.
1786,2020-04-29 17:37:05,gac73c,"Signing Stanley to a 5-year deal would require MORE APY, not less.

Also, Bowser commands substantially more than that in all likelihood."
1787,2020-04-29 20:26:46,gac73c,"Unless we guarantee >85% of Stanley’s deal, 5 yr / 100 MM isn’t gonna cut it. I’m not opposed to a large guarantee at all but I’d predict something more like 5 yr / 110 MM, with 80 MM guaranteed. Expensive but well worth it.

Judon is going to demand, at minimum, a Trey Flowers deal, which he’s not gonna be worth unless he takes a ZDS-size step forward this season. I’m predicting something like 4 yr/72 MM, and unless he acheives double digit sacks I hope it’s not from us.

I’d like to see us do a lot of frontloading, and extend our stars early if possible. We need to roll over as much cap as we can to try and keep our young core together."
1788,2020-04-29 19:54:21,gac73c,"Is Snead a free agent? Didn't we originally sign him for three years and give him an extension last season?

Also I think the only unrestricted guy that we're re-signing here is Stanley. Everybody else you listed is probably gone except Edwards who could potentially be brought back on the original tender like you said. Skura is a possibility if he never really returns to form this year after the injury and just sticks around on a 1-yr deal."
1789,2020-04-29 21:54:21,gac73c,All we need to do is keep Ronnie here and we win free agency. 2022 is going to be a tricky one.
1790,2020-04-29 22:28:01,gac73c,Stanley will likely take $23+ Million to keep considering he's been way better than Tunsil.
1791,2020-04-29 23:25:22,gac73c,[deleted]
1792,2020-04-29 18:23:14,gac73c,"Stanley is the best tackle in the league, and when the cap shoots up after the tv contracts it’s going to be at min double what your estimate says.  20 million to Stanley is an insult, and I think he gets like 40-50 million."
1793,2020-04-29 16:58:18,gac73c,"Judon is definitely an underestimation he’s made it clear he wants to be paid as a top pass rusher. Stanley I think is pretty accurate. If he gets a longer deal it’ll be slightly less money per year, that’s just how the deals gonna be."
1794,2020-04-29 18:27:13,gac73c,I think both contracts will be front-loaded with more guaranteed money. $15M for Judon is what I think he's worth but he does hold more power now that we didn't draft or sign any replacement. He could push for $17M with another strong season but at that price I would hope we look at other options
1795,2020-04-29 20:54:27,gac73c,"I second this thought, Judon wants to get paid more / probably a longer deal. The ravens are giving him his year to prove he can be a suggs-like corner stone of the LB core. As much as I love the guy, I do not see him playing at a level where the FO feels they MUST pay him and we unfortunately see him in a different jersey next season.   


Stanely also gets 23m+ easily after the tunsil deal."
1796,2020-04-29 18:32:19,gac73c,I think we try and keep Brown.
1797,2020-04-29 18:07:32,gac73c,"It all depends on the guaranteed money but typically longer contracts = more security so players will be willing to take less per year.

Bowser depends whether he can step up this year but if he doesn't improve on his 5 sacks it's hard to put him above Jordan Jenkins ($5M/yr) and Devon Kennard ($6.6M/yr) both of whom signed new contracts this year and have 2+ years of at least 7 sacks"
1798,2020-04-29 21:01:42,gac73c,"I agree with you about Judon. I think $15M/yr is what he's worth, but I could live with up to $17M since we're so thin at Edge but I think we should look elsewhere above that"
1799,2020-04-30 00:16:02,gac73c,"Right!? And snead. It actually puts a bit more perspective into our draft picks.

This is what I was hoping readers would from this. Not whether Stanley and Judon are gonna get $1M more"
1800,2020-04-29 19:33:38,gac73c,Are you insane? Elite QB is the only position worth than 15% of the teams cap space.  The salary cap would have to double for that to make sense
1801,2020-04-29 17:52:06,gac73c,Stanley will command more since dumbshit BOB down in Houston destroyed the LT market by overpaying Tunsil
1802,2020-04-30 01:05:49,gac73c,Lol @ Judon wanting to be paid as a top pass rusher
1803,2020-04-29 22:30:22,gac73c,Maybe if it's $100 mill fully gauranteed and up to like 130 with incentives
1804,2020-04-29 18:36:07,gac73c,"Im guessing we extend Judon before this season kicks off, lowering this year and pushing some of that money back. Maybe 13m this year to clear some room for one last signing in win-now mode and then maybe 18m per year starting next year."
1805,2020-04-29 19:35:11,gac73c,"It will be tough, It's hard to justify spending that much cap on one position group. Ronnie needs to be signed and Lamar will need a new contract a year after Orlando. Plus we need to pay Marlon and possibly Andrews. Orlando could be a casualty. I think Marlon, Ronnie,  and Lamar are the keys. Everyone else is up in the air"
1806,2020-04-29 22:32:37,gac73c,I think Brown might give us a hometown discount but he's still not gonna be taking chump change by any stretch of the imagination.
1807,2020-04-29 19:50:44,gac73c,At the same time more years out of the market more money lost due to cap going up and therefore being able to get more money as your worth goes up under the cap.  Essentially if Stanley took a 5 year deal where he made 20 million a year after the cap goes up to 240 then he’d be losing money for every year after as the cap increases.  It’s essentially like inflation.  It’s why the NBA players are increasingly getting greedy.
1808,2020-04-29 19:54:33,gac73c,"Look at it this way Stanley gets paid 20 million a year for five seasons when the cap hits 240 then after that the next year it goes up to 260.  20 million of 240 is 8.3333 percent whereas 20 million of 260 is 7.69 now you can argue whether or not a security blanket is worth that loss, but after 5 seasons that amount really adds up."
1809,2020-04-29 19:35:36,gac73c,I don’t think he takes less then Tunsil.  Like 25 million a year would be a decent number the cap is supposed to be like 240 million after TV deals.  That’s slightly over 10 percent which I think is perfectly reasonable for a HOF trajectory tackle.
1810,2020-04-29 22:26:06,gac73c,Don’t be a BOB.
1811,2020-04-30 01:36:46,gac73c,Stanley won’t command more than tunsil per year if he does a five year contract vs a three year.
1812,2020-04-30 01:08:21,gac73c,Yeah I don’t agree with it either. Judon is at best an above average guy who’s decent at getting pressure and setting the edge. However there’s no fucking way he should be getting paid like a top 10 pass rusher even. Dude wasn’t even consistently good here and he’s not even double teamed that often. He disappears way too much to be worth that much.
1813,2020-04-29 19:40:50,gac73c,That's possible
1814,2020-04-29 19:35:59,gac73c,I think if there’s a group we can justify it it’s probably tackle.
1815,2020-04-29 22:35:25,gac73c,If we can spend like 10 million a year on him plus the 25 we will probably have to give to Stanley it’s probably worth it 35 million a year for the best tackle pair in the league.  35 million out of 240 plus the cap continues to grow in that 5 year period.  According to my math it’s like over 14 percent of the cap dedicated to starting tackles which seems reasonable given the fact that they are the next most important position behind QB.
1816,2020-04-29 19:45:02,gac73c,yes-that's reasonable. the 40-50 mil that you listed previously is ridiculous
1817,2020-04-29 20:29:26,gac73c,"Exactly, top 3 most valuable non-QB positions are EDGE, T, and CB. No shame in allocating a lot of cap to elite players at those positions, and relying on bargain FAs and the draft to fill holes at other spots."
1818,2020-04-29 20:33:14,gac73c,Disagree it’s Tackle then Corner then Edge.  Pass coverage >>>> Pass Rush
1819,2020-04-29 21:03:15,gac73c,"It was in no particular corner but I think T is top, then CB=EDGE"
1820,2020-04-29 21:04:19,gac73c,"Disagree it’s easier to scheme pressure then it is to scheme coverage.  You aren’t going to scheme coverage very well against elite QBs sure you can dunk on Sam Darnold or other average QBs all day, but Mahomes or Prime Brees is going to tear your heart out."
1821,2020-04-29 21:13:25,gac73c,"Counterpoint: the SB team San Francisco 49ers

1822,2020-04-29 21:15:44,gac73c,"Mahomes beat them.  I’ll admit they did beat the shit out of the Packers, but the Packers had one really good WR and that’s it.  Also Aaron Rodgers was no longer in his prime.  This year was like his worst possibly ever."

1841,2020-04-28 15:28:44,g9oph4,"Cavs were also 6-0 against the Bulls in the regular season (including 2 blowout wins) and had won 7 straight against the Bulls dating back to regular season in 1988. It is reasonable to believe the Cavs should have easily won this series considering how it took MJ having the best series of his life to barely win 3-2 the last year in '88 and the '89 Cavs were way better (42 wins - > 57 wins). Still MJ averaged 40/6/8 on 60 TS and hit the series game winner.

Also kind of proves the regular season doesn't mean shit in the playoffs and why IMO if the Bulls had MJ then they probably beat the Rockets in '94 if he didn't retire"

1890,2020-04-27 23:07:54,g97s3a,He also appears in the Hudson River.
1891,2020-04-28 04:15:19,g97s3a,"....I somehow missed the Sporcle part in the original post and damn this is incredibly my shit now, I know what’s occupying the part of my work computer that is normally dedicated to the crossword tomorrow."
1892,2020-04-28 01:04:40,g97s3a,Yeah I was also wondering where TC-14 was..
1893,2020-04-28 14:39:25,g97s3a,For that I'd direct you to the quiz.
1894,2020-04-27 23:11:44,g97s3a,"Griffin, Obi-Wan, Natalie Portman. Yes he should have played the third lead in that."
1895,2020-04-28 04:14:05,g97s3a,"Miyazaki, Tony Stark & Bill Murray. That'd be a fun hang."
1896,2020-04-28 04:26:39,g97s3a,"Tony Stark, Griffin Newman, Chris Gethard.  I’m happy"
1897,2020-04-28 04:30:52,g97s3a,"Ben, Tom cruise, beetle juice. Now I want this crew next year."
1898,2020-04-27 22:02:31,g97s3a,I first thought it was Laura Haddock (Meredith Quill in GotG). Even that is REALLY high.
1899,2020-04-28 04:17:23,g97s3a,He's a weird dude who briefly appeared on the Showgirls episode and then co-hosted several of the March Madness recap episodes on Patreon.
1900,2020-04-27 20:13:23,g97s3a,"I did, mainly under the rationale that there's one retired bit at a time so that was a title that could only refer to Joker (whereas I don't count general stuff like ""The Wife"")."
1901,2020-04-27 20:15:44,g97s3a,This is Known
1902,2020-04-28 00:37:50,g97s3a,On* the Hudson River.
1903,2020-04-28 03:26:39,g97s3a,"Same with Hayden Christensen, who I am confident that they mention by name in the Attack of the Podcast and Revenge of the Podcast more so than they mention 'Anakin'.... 

...unless they're combining the character with the actor, which why would Tony Stark an RDJ both be on there?"
1904,2020-04-27 23:53:50,g97s3a,"~~69, dude!!!~~ Wait, no. Isn't Griffin's in Feb? NP's is 6/9."
1905,2020-04-28 04:18:59,g97s3a,"I wonder if Miyazaki had a Marvel movie made, would Murray be his animated Stark?"
1906,2020-04-28 04:36:35,g97s3a,That's a wet crew.
1907,2020-04-28 12:45:53,g97s3a,"Huh, weird.  I remember listening to those episodes, but I don't remember the name...

... although I do remember having an intensely white light consume my vision, and feeling a terrible ringing pierce my ears.  Then, I find myself waking many hours later, having collapsed on the floor, somehow knowing the day and hour at which I will die.....

...but, no.  No memory of ""Chip Smith""."
1908,2020-04-28 12:51:19,g97s3a,"No combining. They mention Anakin way, way, wayyyyy more. Why would they mention Christensen more when there are entire episodes of just talking about the plot? Hayden is still very close to making those top 10s though. But Hayden maxes out at being said 15-20 times in an episode (and not mentioned at all in several plot-specific episodes), while Anakin/Vader is said in every episode of those series, often more than 60 times, and as many as 118 in an episode (two of the episodes are literally almost 2 hour character profiles of Anakin)."
1909,2020-04-28 14:30:43,g97s3a,"Answers my question, thanks!"

1920,2020-06-26 00:57:23,hfxisk,"I wouldn't mind Terry at all if the board went this way. Simply because Terry is an upside play.

But I want to just make everyone aware that the Jazz believe in their core (as do I as a Jazz fan). They are not looking for a Conley replacement. They are not planning to trade Gobert and are not looking for a replacement.

I know this team inside and out. They are looking to supplement what they have. And since they have limited ways to improve financially it's likely they use their draft pick to fill a need. A few things they'll be targeting...

A big wing who can defend big wings. A low offensive usage connective tissue type of guy who help connect the high usage players on the roster and make lineups flow better. Possibly a stretch 5. Athleticism. Defense.

A few guys in particular that I think they'll have their eye on...

Jalen Smith, Aleksej Pokusevski, Precious Achiuwa, Paul Reed, Saddiq Bey, Tyler Bey, Xavier Tillman, Zeke Nnaji. If they go guard then Devon Dotson is a possible target because his play style fits the Jazz scheme so well."
1921,2020-06-26 02:35:09,hfxisk,"You skipped the Suns at #10 and Kira Lewis isn’t on here. I’m guessing you mocked him #10. I think I’d take him at #5 for Minnesota if Ball, Edwards, and Hayes are gone.

Also, I’d take Poku or Hampton at #16 and Isaiah Joe at #33."
1922,2020-06-26 15:36:13,hfxisk,Great mock! Hawks fan
1923,2020-06-26 18:35:21,hfxisk,This is one of the better mocks ive seen. I don't agree with the Bulls pick though. I think Vassell is the pick there. But that's my personal opinion
1924,2020-07-27 08:23:24,hfxisk,"Damn bro you weren't lying. You did have bane early to Philly. Nice work.

1927,2020-06-25 14:47:44,hfih6o,"Mitch Lewis should be brought in for O’Brien, because unless Tim can start clunking marks, he doesn’t have a place in the team. Lewis went really well in the scratch match as well.

I hope Puopolo gets kept out of the team. He’s been a passenger for a while now, and I’m shocked Scrimshaw wasn’t in the team before Poppy got injured."

1931,2020-06-25 15:17:18,hfih6o,I think that we'll win this game provided North Melbourne don't play that well and we play pretty good. OR... If we play OK and they play really really bad. OR... If Jonno Patton kicks THIRTEEN... THIRTEEEEEN
1932,2020-06-26 07:13:01,hfih6o,We're unchanged.
1933,2020-06-26 06:01:20,hfih6o,O’Brien has shown more than Patton IMO.
1934,2020-06-27 01:09:22,hfih6o,"I think both Patton and O'Brien will be given a fair bit of time to get used to playing alongside each other.  I agree, O'Brien does need to start taking marks, but at least he's getting to the contests. Patton is coming off 18 months on the sidelines and is now in a brand new team, so i don't expect we'll see the best from him till at least the second half of the season."
1935,2020-06-25 21:33:56,hfih6o,"Bit harsh. While Poppy has lost that half a step definitely he still puts on forward pressure like no other for us, he creates chaos when the ball goes to ground in our forward half and brings opportunity, he's not getting rewarded himself on the scoreboard but I still think he has an important role to play."
1936,2020-06-26 23:43:46,hfih6o,I just don’t understand how he is missing out when Tim O’Brien is in the side and couldn’t take a single Mark last week despite the good service.
1937,2020-06-25 11:22:00,hfih6o,Lewis apparently went very well in the Scratch match last week.
1938,2020-06-26 06:02:47,hfih6o,"I’m willing to give Patton more leeway. O’Brien is very hit or miss, and at the moment it’s all misses."
1939,2020-06-28 01:30:14,hfih6o,Agreed. It's really tough without the vfl though. A few weeks of dominating defenders and big hauls would be so useful for all our tall forwards right now
1940,2020-06-27 03:33:34,hfih6o,I would agree but he hasn't been playing like he used to. Has kicked just 3 goals in his past 12 games and he used to be ranked elite in tackles and pressure acts but this year he's only ranked average in both.
1941,2020-06-25 12:57:00,hfgn5g,">In 2001, Christopher Newton, imprisoned for burglary, murdered his cellmate, Jason Brewer, 27, over a game of chess in a Ohio prison. Brewer would resign his chess game against Newton every time a pawn was lost or the position looked bad. Newton tried to tell him not to give up and play the game out, but Brewer refused. After a month of playing chess and Brewer always resigning early without playing out the game, Newton finally had enough and strangled Brewer. Newton was executed on May 24, 2007 by lethal injection on Ohio. He was the first murderer executed for killing someone over a chess game.

Oh no, this sets up a very bad precedent on why people should not resign too early. ""What's the harm in continuing the game, no one has ever died for it""."

2002,2020-06-24 03:24:04,hesfce,I just can't play anymore.
2003,2020-06-24 03:04:43,hesfce,"I thought FF said something about children being able to solve it. I also recall him saying all you need is the poem and the map, not a computer cypher program and calculus and a protractor. There’s obviously a lot of thought put into this solve but it seems maybe too much thought."
2004,2020-06-24 03:19:56,hesfce,"I know there were ciphers in the poem (and in the books) ... Fenn is a freakin' genius .. but, I think he left a TON of false trails.  One of the things he loved about fishing was the fish rising to take the bait.  I ""rose"" and took the bait a thousand times.  His little clues about Robert Redford's book led me to the Outlaw Trail and a million different places along the trail.  He wanted you to follow these false clues ... this Thrill of the Chase. He's a heck of a fisherman and he got a lot of people to ""rise"" to all kinds of bait!"
2005,2020-06-24 06:44:36,hesfce,"You lost me at cipher, so pretty early on there, but it was a fun read. I spent some time reading maps around the Bighorn. Attractive area.

Then you lost me again at ""inverse tangent formula (or a protractor if you have one available).""

But, it was still a fun read."

Did you know 'Medicine Wheel' is also the name of a trail in Cheyenne Mountain State Park? 😉"

Also is there any way you could include more women directors in the list? I know there’s not that many but still it’d be nice 💕

2020,2020-06-23 17:24:23,heij2w,"Seeing how much Bridgers loves Elliott makes me happy, so this doesn't matter too much, but just in case anyone was wondering if Son of Sam was *really* inspired by the serial killer, here's what Elliott said in an interview from April of 2000:

""No, it was made before I knew about that movie... and then when the movie came out I was like, ""Oh no! It's gonna rain on my parade."". It's not about the serial killer, I'm not sure exactly what it's about because it's just sort of like telling someone a dream you had last night. There are some destructive figures in it, 'Son of Sam', Shiva... but Shiva's also associated with creativity... I'm not sure... it's just an impressionistic song about destruction and creativity, I guess; if it's about anything."""
2021,2020-06-23 17:20:13,heij2w,Yep. I hear Elliott in a lot of music today. He's still with us
2022,2020-06-23 18:58:57,heij2w,I hear him a lot in her vocal melodies specifically.
2023,2020-06-23 19:23:16,heij2w,Wow how deep of her to once again mention Elliott’s music but to completely miss the meaning of the song lol.
2024,2020-06-23 18:47:10,heij2w,"I wonder how much of that is true. Seems highly coincidental to use the lines ""couple killer"" and ""acting under orders from above"" in a song titled son of sam and apparently it not be related to the serial killer in any form."
2025,2020-06-23 19:44:31,heij2w,"Thank for this! I had never seen this quote. I def still feel like a few of the lines in Son of Sam are references to the serial killer, but clearly that's not the main inspiration behind the song."
2026,2020-06-23 19:41:36,heij2w,not sure she completely missed the meaning - there are several lines in son of sam that v clearly reference the serial killer and she didnt say that was the entire meaning of the song. giving her the benefit of the doubt here bc its clear she is a huge fan
2027,2020-06-23 19:14:15,heij2w,"the song was not about the serial killer per se, but the Son of Sam character was part of the song, so the lines are not coincidental. But I think it would be very reductive to say the song is about the serial killer since his songwriting is more complex and the meanings of his songs are multi layered."
2028,2020-06-23 19:34:44,heij2w,Oh I'm aware it's more complex. Didn't mean to say the song was soley about the serial killer. Maybe i misinterpreted but just seems to imply from the quote that he didn't know there was a son of sam until there was a movie
2029,2020-06-23 02:11:52,he58r2,"My main hangup with this fix and TASM movies is the rehash of Raimi villains that had just been done. I love the fact that the MCU has done live-action villains we haven't seen before.

I'd keep Lizard, Vulture, Black Cat and Kingpin as the baddies you mentioned and ditch the rest. But, that's just my preference."
2030,2020-06-22 19:01:41,hdvryq,"Samantha Smith actually goes by Sam, too. (I mean, she already did, long before this show) They’ve joked about it at cons, along with the thing about how Jared Padalecki’s character in Gilmore Girls was named Dean."
2031,2020-06-22 16:42:22,hdvryq,Yeah

I live in the UK, and have generally been very strict to adhering to the rules during lockdown. In the UK we are now allowed to have groups of up to 6 people gathering in gardens and other private outdoor spaces.

My husband and I are climbers and all the climbing gyms in UK are still closed. As many climbers have done, we have constructed our own climbing wall in our private back garden for exercise and to keep us sane during the lockdown.

With the new easing of restrictions, for the past 3 weeks we have started having up to 4 friends over for climbing sessions. It is the only face to face social interaction we have had for months. We do this for 3 hours once a week on Saturdays, from 12 noon to 3pm. During these sessions there is some cheering (when people are sending a route) and normal conversation, but we are all in our late 30s/early 40s, honestly nothing I would consider rowdy behaviour.

Yesterday during our climbing session our next door neighbour started blasting Sam Smith at such a high volume that we could barely hear each other talking. Once our friends left, our neighbour later had a go at us for having friends over every week, saying he was ""fucked off"" with us because he likes to read his newspaper in the garden on Saturdays and he didn't like being able to hear every word of our conversations with our friends. He said he started playing music so he wouldn't have to listen to us talking. And he told us that after we finish a climb, our friends should go sit at the far end of the garden so he doesn't have to hear us talking.

I understand lockdown is frustrating and difficult for everyone and we need to be extra considerate to our neighbours at this time. But I feel he was being a hypocrite as he also has friends round for meals or to hang out in his garden around once a week, and we can also hear every single word they say, but since it's just for a couple of hours we either suck it up or go hang out inside our own house. We told him this, and that we will ask our friends to tone it down with the cheering if it disturbs him, but we won't stop having conversations with our friends or be moving where we sit in our own garden.

So Reddit, AITA? I don't want to be a bad neighbour, so it really bothers me that our neighbour is angry and has complained, but I also don't think that having friends over for 3 hours once a week is unreasonable or antisocial behaviour. I also don't want to stop our climbing sessions because it is our only social interaction during the week and is honestly the only thing keeping us sane.

2208,2020-06-21 07:32:26,hd1udb,Thanks for the feedback man! Really appreciate it. Do you have any tips on exercises to strengthen my falsetto?
2209,2020-06-21 07:11:13,hd1udb,"Hey! So first thing is the song is in a higher key than what you're singing (that's okay, but just wanted to make sure you know). There are some flat parts throughout, so constantly be aware of the notes you're singing (and aim a little higher for each note). Be careful where the air flow is going, practice singing by pinching your nose and seeing where the air is trying to escape to avoid the ""nasally"" sound.

Other than that, dynamics are good.

Keep working on your falsetto, as girls find it tremendously attractive when you can sing well through it 😎.

Shoot for vocal training, I think it would really benefit you.

Best of luck"

2217,2020-06-21 01:02:50,hcph6g,"I don't get how team 1 ended up with some of those players in a SF. It seems as if team 12 and 2 just gave team 1 early picks for picks in the 10th round... Like team 1 probably was a top 3 draft slot, so I am confused on how he ended up with multiple players who should have gone earlier, while it seems team 2 and 12 kept reaching for trash. I would love to see this draft board. Team 1>4>8>5>10 then the rest with >>>>>>>>> 2 and 12. Just saw in the dynasty thread it was auction and some players were autodrafted. That sucks man that's a set up to have those guys not stick around and have a hard time finding replacements cause their teams are sooooooo bad"
2218,2020-06-20 17:01:13,hcph6g,"Teams 1-5: clearly missed.
Teams 6-9: missed due to team comp (bad drafting)
Teams 10-11: very close, but draft positioning and poor selection make these reasonably bad

Wouldn't it be nicer if we just waiting to try to have a proper season next year? Instead of a butchered playoffs this year, leading into a butchered season next year."
2226,2020-06-20 14:13:26,hcl5gc,"I know this ain't the thread but the Carcillo story may not even be the thing that shocked me most from this country the last few days. Apparently, Maclean's did a story that the guy who shot 22 people in Nova Scotia could be an undercover RCMP agent......"
2227,2020-06-20 19:47:10,hcl5gc,"Recent article on The Athletic is speculating that 40% of players, and maybe even more, are not sure they want to return to play. 

If true that is a pretty significant number. And I wish they would just cancel the fucking season at this point. I’d rather be having a normal offseason so I can at least enjoy the draft and free agency coming up instead of delaying all that."
2228,2020-06-21 00:16:10,hcl5gc,"Could the mods possibly change the sidebar slogan to say 'The Offside doesn't matter, black lives do'?

That way, you're saying black lives matter AND incorporating a hockey theme into it at the same time."

2231,2020-06-20 16:01:45,hcl5gc,Agreed 100%. It's also impossible to pick a host city with zero risk of the virus. Who knows where this will blow up next. Keep the players safe and at home until we can start a new season. I think a lot of the players would be more comfortable with that as well.

More like Bobby Darin. I'd wager Moore's Bond was more into Soul and Jazz, but also nothing too freaky. And besides the Rat Pack I'd keep Brosnans Bond secretely as a total 80s dude. Huey Lewis and the News and the likes.

Craig...honestly, I think he's mopeing along to minimalist music, bit of electro, like what is today called lofi hip hop and is really just a different kind of jazz. Also, totally into the spacier stuff that resembles Radioheads Kid A."
2236,2020-06-20 15:52:47,hc59xx,"I don't think Craig's Bond would enjoy music. His empty flat I think is meant to display a lack of interests outside his work.

Moore wouldn't be into ""hippy"" music. More lounge lizard kind of stuff.

Connery, the type of music popular in britain just before the Beatles. The shadows? Gerry and the pacemakers?"

Funniest part is the inconsistency. Does Naughty Player score enough for it to be smoothed over, or are they a bum or on a bad contract and get cancelled immediately??

I like high pitched male singers, but I can't stand singers who sing in the style of Sam Smith for example. 

Don't feel too bad. As long as you're elitist about it, everyone's entitled to their preference."

2295,2020-06-17 19:28:51,hauv5l,"Most of the artists you mentioned aren't new at all. Sam Smith, The Weeknd and PND have all had full (e: & chart dominating) careers by now. 

Also, Ella Mai is an exception. Boo'd up didn't enter the top 50 and her album barely reached the top 20 (in the UK), but someone like Sam Smith committed unspeakable atrocities on the charts in England. Seriously, how did the general public allow them to have so many hits?! 

The Weeknd too had a massive impact on the charts in his home country.

Genres aren't really that determined by country borders anymore. If a song is a hit in America, it's most likely a hit everywhere else. If it's not, that's determined by the activity of local artists and record labels' willingness to push a release internationally."

Like in some sense I get what you are saying, but at the same time, you gotta realize that won't apply here. Different countries have different customs, cultures, a lot is different. Saying it is arbitrary doesn't really work here, the country a person grows up in will shape a lot of who they are, and by extension, the art they create."

Personally I don't consider it a mistake on GRRM's behalf.

Some animals you don't distinguish their genders thanks to their genitalia only, but also size and colors, for example. Think of cats: 3 colors? Definitely a female.

And in foxes' case, broad head=male, narrow head=female.

We struggle with the concept because we don’t see foxes everyday. Chances are, most of contemporary humans cannot recognize one tree from another. Arya is a medieval girl, of course she does.

Unrelated, but this tidbit made me realize how unlikely it is that so few flowers show up in asoiaf. I mean, given the setting...

20 

Consistency detail I had missed. Good job!



22 

Asoiaf is full of Biblical references. Think of the Lazhareen cult of the Great Shepherd. Unsurprisingly that the only character who opposed to their ideology is the bloodthirsty Red Lamb (a nickname even more telling, given that the Lamb is the symbol of peace and innocence).

[Some more](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/6f8iiw/spoilers_extended_jesus_greyjoy_an_essay_about/) if you're interested, but mind I was oversimplifying a bit.

25 

Is the Red Comet actually gone?

For some reason I thought it is still visible because otherwise I guess some POV would have pointed out its absence.

31

The discrepancy brigantine/brigandine can probably be explained from GRRM borrowing from european language rather than contemporary english. Fwiw in my main language both are called with the same exact term.


33

AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH love this shit... Gonna try this one when I’m more free. Sweet Donnel Hill stays my favorite one, he’s the ultimate winner if you think about it.


37 

Very curious.


44 

For some reason I never considered it was Amory, but only because I can’t imagine those people never feeding other humans to the bear.
Never bothered checking the timeline and see if maggots still apply, tho.


63

FWIW I always thought that this is the origin behind the name of Septon Cellador… given that he is always visiting the cellar (being drunk).


73

Awesome pick. 


74 

Personally what happens in the scene right before that cheating is the coldest I’ve ever seen Arya get, when put in perspective.

>A half-dozen other Saltpans folks were around, going about their business, so Arya knew she couldn't kill the woman. 

And there's fans that still insist about Arya being “good”. Creepy vibes all around, girl’s the equivalent of a child soldier. The fact that she can rationalize murder so easily and dismiss it just because there would be witness is chilling.

2313,2020-06-30 16:42:30,hip052,"It's amazing how much that Jimmy Butler pick is carrying the Bulls in this ranking.

The Bulls made 19 raw selections since 2010 but through trades they ended up keeping 13* of them.

Of those 13 they currently have 6 on the team, Coby White, Daniel Gafford, Wendell Carter Jr, Chandler Hutchison, Lauri Markkanen, Denzel Valentine.

Of those 6 all 6 of them were playing on their rookie contracts this season. 

While I am excited about the core the Bulls have put in place, provided they can find an NBA level head coach, I do think this ranking needs to take in to account whether or not teams were able to build around the picks that are being ranked so highly and the Bulls absolutely punted on building around Jimmy Butler which should count against them.



*Malcolm Lee, Kevin Seraphin, Norris Cole, Gary Harris, Jusuf Nurkic, Jordan Bell, Justin Patton were all traded before putting on a Bulls uniform in exchange for cap space, cap space, cap space, Doug McDermot, Cash Considerations, Lauri Markkenan more or less in that order."
2314,2020-06-30 17:46:10,hip052,"Really fascinating look. It’s been a popular topic on YouTube recently, interesting to see a data based approach. 

Something that this doesn’t account for with the Mavs specifically, they’ve been lights out identifying UDFAs. 

Yogi Ferrel, DFS, and Maxi Kleber were all Undrafted. The latter 2 are starters/key role players on the current playoff team. 

I know it’s not really relevant to the question, but the Mavs excellence in the second round in FA should give them a little forgiveness for their 20 years of incompetence in the first round, save for Luka."
2315,2020-06-30 19:04:17,hip052,"I'm just curious. Do the rankings calculate in undrafted guys? If not, that makes the Raptors being first even more impressive, because guys like Fred VanVleet and Terence Davis went undrafted. Even the Jonas Valanciunas pick, which is listed as the worst on the first chart, was pretty solid. He went 5th overall, and the picks right after him were Jan Vesely, Bismack Biyombo and Brandon Knight. JV didn't turn into a superstar, but he's been a pretty solid starter for his whole career.

As for other teams, that Kawhi pick really lifts the Spurs. They have had some other good picks (like Dejounte Murray), but overall, I don't know that I would rank them as high as #2.

I like the Nuggets drafting better than the Spurs. Obviously, the Jokic pick carries them a lot, but I think that MPJ will end up rating very highly on there given a few more years (got him criminally low at #14). While he won't be a superstar, I think the Malik Beasley pick will look great in a couple of years, too. He couldn't get enough playing time with their deep lineup, but now that he looks like he will get a bigger role, I think he will be a breakout guy in the next couple of years. Another guy they drafted, who developed on another team, and who isn't mentioned there is Evan Fournier, who they snagged at 20th overall in 2012. Maybe that doesn't count, since they traded him after a couple of years for Arron Afflalo, but, if we are just looking at drafting, then they did draft him. Overall, I think once the MPJ and Beasley picks have some time to settle, the Nuggets will jump up to #2 on there.

From the rest, the one team that is criminally low on that list is the Grizzlies. I assume that is because their last couple of draft picks haven't had the time to fully develop their resumes in the NBA. They got lucky to get the #2 pick for Ja last year, but they also got the steal of the draft with Brandon Clarke at 21. The previous year, Jaren Jackson was a great grab, albeit with a high pick at #4, but they also snagged Jevon Carter at 32, who got traded to Phoenix, but looks like a solid rotation piece. They got Dillon Brooks at 45 in 2017 (a 15.7 ppg starter in his third season). So, while they didn't draft well at the start of the decade, I think that once the recent draftees have a bit more time to improve their resumes, they will rank much higher on that list."

2317,2020-06-30 17:24:09,hip052,"I've got to say I really don't like the results the VORP version was generating. To a certain extent you have to judge the quality of the metrics by the results its giving you, and that VORP list is clearly favoring guys who had a brief splash of surprising efficient play and then flamed out (Fields, Peters, Hummel) or who look decent but haven't proven anything yet (Niang, Time Lord).

The WS version looks really nice and gives some very reasonable results."
2318,2020-06-30 19:04:58,hip052,"As a Raptors fan, I'm not super surprised, but I did have a question.

Even with how Pascal is poised to enter the top 10 (though his play did worsen a bit throughout the year), I feel surprised to see Green award fewer points than him, he was a later pick and to me it's a no-brainer which has been so far. Hell, even if Siakam has been a top 15 player (arguably) this year, I would argue that Draymond is top 10 come playoffs. Not just that, but Delon's above him, who I know less about - does he really deserve the amount of points he's getting?"
2319,2020-06-30 17:41:34,hip052,I would have to say the warriors did the best drafting as they made a dynasty off their own draft picks. Draymond at the end of the second round might be one of the goat picks and curry and klay were both great picks as well.

2320,2020-06-30 18:07:53,hip052,"This is so strange to me because Dillon Brooks was pretty much the de facto Grizzlies’ best draft pick this past decade until landing Jaren and Ja/Clarke in back to back drafts. The Grizzlies were one of the worst drafting teams in the league under the chunderhead former GM Chris Wallace, but still were a playoff mainstay for much of the 2010s"
2321,2020-06-30 17:35:04,hip052,"I really like this post as a whole but the one thing that set off my Celtics Fan Bias was that Avery Bradley was considered a massive negative for the Celtics despite him being considered a pretty good player before he was traded from the Celtics. 

But even more than that if you back to the 2010 draft there are only 22 other guys I recognize from the NBA, so there is absolutely no reason he would be a reach at 19. Having looked at his career vorp and ws, he is not favored by these statistics, in fact his career vorp is negative, but his numbers at Boston are certainly better (his vorp becomes 1 instead of negative) maybe it’s worth considering only the seasons players spent with the team who drafted them.

I know you switched to win shares which makes Greg Monroe one of the better picks despite him being evolved out of the league. So maybe vorp for drafting team would be a better measure, because you are focusing on how draftees are affecting their original team."

2326,2020-06-30 18:12:48,hip052,"This is really cool. Two things.

1. Did you thibk of looking at the data another way, where instead of ranking by total value relative to draft spot it’s by the percent of the time that a team gets a player who is better than the average player drafted in that spot. This method is of course basic and imperfect, and could be fine-tuned with weighting the actual value vs. draft spot a bit, but I feel like it adjusts for luck. Although unlikely, any team can draft a seocnd round or late first round player who becomes an all star. It’d be cool to see if there are any teams that consistently draft well, and not just hit the jackpot a couple of times.

2. How did you assemble this data? I’m guessing you didn’t go through every class by hand (unless you did, of course, and in that case massive props to you), and then how did you do it? What tools? Would really appreciate if you could share."
2327,2020-06-30 18:25:37,hip052,"Have been looking for something like this. Also, another factor that could be included into this would be that specific player’s performance on their particular team that drafted them. Notably, Sacramento is getting carried by Whiteside who played a mere 19 games and logged 111 minutes over the course of 2 years. It might almost be worse to draft a good player late in the draft but then give up on them too early."
2328,2020-06-30 16:06:56,hip052,"Hi my dude, it is a very nicely done statistical post, I certainly hope you get more responses than mine.

I only have one qualm, which comes with the definition of success as a regular season victory.

As time passes, more and more teams load manage precisely because after about 44 wins, apart from perhaps seeding, doesn't matter if you win 45-50 or 65.

I see at the top of the list a majority of teams that have not won anything, and I struggle to agree with a definition of success different from the end goal of any GM which is to eventually attain a championship.

For example.. apart from last year, due to Kawhi being there, you get a bunch of empty wins in the regular seasons by the raptors and then regularly wiped.

Same by the Jazz, so I guess my question is what you define the purpose of the draft to be and/or how could one solved my complaint :)"
2329,2020-06-30 18:37:35,hip052,"I think you need to smooth out any adjustments you make due to draft position. There are too many outliers that distort the value curve. The 5th overall position is a good example of this. You have greats such as Garnett, Allen, Wade, and Carter drafted 5th overall, so your calculation probably shows the 5th overall pick should be extremely valuable. This unfairly penalizes any other 5th overall pick, which is probably why you have Valanciunas so low in your first table. He had the 5th most win shares in his draft year."
2330,2020-07-01 00:27:25,hip052,This is great! I looked at doing something like this once but wasn’t quite as objective in the sense of using win shares or any other metric but more personal preference. I tried to look at what if our teams could go into the past and draft the best players available to them in order to build the best team now- who would have the best team? So Giannis would be drafted by whomever had the #1 pick that year and such. It was pretty interesting but I didn’t finish it. Might be something fun to follow up on your data!
2331,2020-07-11 06:32:37,hip052,"The problem with this list is the negative players.  For example,  It's simply not fair to almost entirely cancel out the Jokic pick because Mudiay was shit.  But Mudiay was only so shitty because the Nuggets actually gave him a chance.  The players who didn't get a chance to play aren't as negative.  The only way to handle this is to see any player that has negative VORP or WS as a net zero because they likely won't be on the team long anyway.  For example was the Mudiay pick really that much worse than the Bruno Caboclo pick? The net result is the same,  they both ended up off their teams.   

&#x200B;

When it comes to the draft we need to assume every player is a bust and only reward non-bust picks.  You can say the farther back a team takes a star the better, but high pick busts should just be counted as equal to low pick busts because taking busts is so common.  For example the 76ers are clearly a top 10 drafting team this decade.  They ended the process with Ben Simmons and Embiid.  Those successful picks actually cancel out many of their bad picks.  Again because everyone is likely to bust we need to treat all busts as equal while only judging the quality of the non-busts."
2332,2020-06-30 20:00:40,hip052,"Hm, just brainstorming a bit about this. How about something like this: Test the picks against how many minutes the players have been playing per season and how many games their team won in those seasons.

Example:

* #1 pick, playing 35 min on a 30 win team
* #46 pick, playing 20 min on a 50 win team

Maybe exclude the first 2-3 seasons to give the team time to grow around their high draft picks, and 2nd round picks to prove their worth. If top players are franchise altering, then their teams should have better records by year 3 or 4. And if the player sucks, they won't receive playing time by this point."
2333,2020-06-30 20:48:44,hip052,"There’s just one thing I gotta address.  How is Karl-Anthony Towns a draft steal?  Yes he’s obviously good value still, but he went #1.  He was the first player selected and expected to be the best.  1st overall picks are usually supposed to become stars and he did just that.  I don’t see how the 1st pick in any draft can be considered a steal.  The 2nd and 3rd picks can easily be steals outperforming #1, but #1 is supposed to be the top.   KAT hasn’t even lead the team to the playoffs yet.  Jimmy Butler did that and then when he left, the Wolves were bad again."
2334,2020-06-30 21:37:10,hip052,"I am inclined to believe that the second method is a better method for determining how good of a pick a draft pick is. I base this on the fact that Markelle Fultz is not considered one of the sixers worst draft picks using the first method. However, in the second method, he is considered one of the worst draft picks. Being picked first overall and never contributing any useful minutes for the team that drafted him, Markelle needs to be considered one of the worst."
2335,2020-06-30 21:55:44,hip052,I think the answer is Milwaukee because they drafted Giannis and the Spurs because they drafted Kawhi. They are the only guys drafted in the 2010s who have shown they could be the best player on a championship team. Everything else you do as a team is secondary to that.
2336,2020-06-30 23:50:56,hip052,"Dang apparently I dont pay nearly enough attention. I had no idea that Winslow hadnt grow into a near All-star type of player yet AND that he got traded. I really thought he was going to be a REALLY good player, like hall of very good by the time he retired, but it seems like he hasnt really grown beyond his shooting getting a bit better"
2337,2020-07-01 00:02:53,hip052,Given the long rightward tail to the distribution this method essentially penalizes teams with a large number of picks high in the draft in the time period relative to teams who have gotten better than expected value out of the middle / back end of the draft. I would argue that nailing high picks is a much more valuable skill than getting value from the middle/end of the draft.
2338,2020-07-01 00:30:40,hip052,"Unpopular opinion, the Kings. I feel that if they make one good blockbuster trade they could be a contender. They’ve stayed in the middle of the pack when it comes to the playoffs but bagley and fox have missed a lot of time as well. But both of them could develop into superstars at their positions, Fox especially. Also earlier in the decade they drafted boogie although he didn’t pan out really. I think if they make one blockbuster trade for an agile wing, someone like DeRozan, I think they could be contenders. That team probably wouldn’t win any rings but they’d be like the grit and grind grizzlies from earlier this decade. They’d get stopped by a team with larger superstar talent though."

Like with the Kings, you have Whiteside, but he didn’t really do anything for them, not coming into his own until he was on the Heat. He played in 1 game his rookie year and recorded 2 fouls. Next season he played in 18 games, and only averaged 1.6ppg, 2.2rpg, and 0.8bpg. His time on the heat shouldn’t really count *for the Kings* right?

I was considering including them in the draft haul, but signing UDFA's is sometimes a 2 way thing. Every year there are UDFAs who have multiple offers and get to choose which team to join which isn't fair to give one of those suitors credit over the rest who also saw the potential. Then I considered including UDFAs in the calculation of the draft class's strength, but I know there are players who ask not to be drafted in the second so they can be a UDFA which, again, is not fair to hold against the actual second rounders and the teams selecting those players. In the end, I decided to consider signing UDFAs as a different action by the front office altogether than drafting, and I would only consider players who were drafted in the top 60 for the purpose of this analysis. It does end up not making teams like the Mavericks and 76ers and other teams who get great value from these signings look as good as they should, but keep in mind this is by no means an indictment of an endorsement of any front office as there are great organizations like the Thunder and Mavericks near the bottom and not-so-great organizations like the Pistons and Bulls near the top."

Essentially, organizations should 100% be credited for getting value from UDFAs, it's just that I couldn't find a fair way to determine their relative values.

I can see your argument for the Spurs being lower. They also got an advanced stats monster in Kyle Anderson at pick 30 in 2014 who has kinda cooled off since leaving the Spurs, but he also increases their rating a lot. Ultimately, the thing the Spurs should be praised for the most is the lack of any real busts. The Nuggets certainly got one of the most valuable picks of the decade in Jokic as well as other nice picks like Beasley, Morris, Harris, Nurkic, Fournier, etc. But they had a really bad miss in Mudiay which dings them, maybe unfairly, but still dings them. Also, I considered using Medians to calculate overall instead of Mean to avoid outliers, but the outliers are more important in a game like basketball where an individual can carry a team like outliers can carry the mean.

I do agree with your assessment of the Grizzlies having a promising future, especially with Ja and Brandon Clarke already so good. I decided against including 2019 because they haven't even played a full season but I'm sure that would have improved the Grizzlies' overall rating. Unfortunately they didn't make any great picks earlier in the decade, which really brings their average down for this decade, but will probably make them look great in the coming one"
2352,2020-06-30 22:44:29,hip052,Grizzlies have been shit at drafting for YEARS. These newer picks being good is just recency bias (and also because their recent picks have been higher).
2353,2020-07-01 00:54:03,hip052,"So you're rating the Nuggets over the Spurs based on projected future performance? That's not really what this post is about. It's about which teams have found the most value relative to their draft position. With the exception of Kawhi, we haven't had a pick higher than 18th in 23 years, and it's only been as high as 18th a couple times. Most years we don't pick higher than like 27th, and yet we still manage to consistently find productive players with our picks. The Nuggets, as you mentioned, have had several lottery picks this decade, and I can only imagine what Pop and Buford could have done drafting at Denver's spots."
2354,2020-06-30 19:48:35,hip052,"2010 Greg Monroe was not a roleplayer. He was a legit starter.

Same guy in the 2020 game is a roleplayer sure."
2355,2020-06-30 19:49:17,hip052,"Agreed, as a Pistons fan our drafting has been terrible in the lottery. We have made some decent late round picks but the issue is that those guys broke out after we moved on which means we didn't actually get benefits

We have basically made 5 good picks across the last decade. 

Two were 2nd rounders that we dumped before they became good later on. 

One is Luke who is a very good player despite the sting of missing on Mitchell. But his injury issues are starting to become a concern and his extension is a big question. 

One is Dre who is immensely talented but is A) inconsistent, B) plays in an arguably outdated style, and C) was vastly overpaid on the max. 

One is Bruce who made huge strides this year and could become a really quality role player or maybe even a starter on the right team.


Also on KCP, at least he's still a decent NBA player but we didn't extend him beyond his rookie deal. That's a good thing considering he wanted 5/80 but spending a lottery pick for just 4 years of a low end role player is just not good.

The problem is that we consistently whiffed on the important picks and gave up on the 2nd rounders that ended up being great value picks. Even teams that are lower in this table got bigger contributions by either hitting on a lottery pick or just keeping guys without overpaying them."
2356,2020-06-30 22:23:49,hip052,"Believe me, I was super shocked as well because I remember the Pistons draft picks being KCP, Stanley Johnson, Henry Ellenson, etc. There's a couple reasons why the Pistons are so high. Win Shares loves Drummond and Monroe and great second round finds in Middleton and Dinwiddie that contributed nothing to Detroit because of poor development/short sightedness. Another reason why I think I never considered the Pistons to be a good drafting organization is because we always remember the ""picked before"" players like Kennard picked before Mitchell, KCP before CJ, Knight before Kemba which does factor somewhat because I rate them based on overall draft class performance, but the fact that the pick right after became so much better makes Detroit's picks look even worse."
2357,2020-06-30 22:00:21,hip052,"To be fair, the pistons have had problems with player development, not drafting. And I think Monroe and knight were a tick above role player quality. They've been pretty productive pros"

One could say the Klay and Draymond picks were the 2 most important draft selections of this decade. That being said, every organization makes mistakes and the Warriors have been guilty of a few. To me the biggest mistake this decade was drafting Ekpe Udoh and I do not want to even imagine what Paul George or Gordon Heyward added to those teams, but that's what they could have had. Of course that is just one mistake, but there have been a couple picks where they didn't really get as much value as they could have. Fortunately for Warriors fans, those ""mistakes"" ended up being inconsequential because of the aforementioned selections and others (like Looney who someone else brought up), great coaching and system which promoted development, and great free agency decisions (like Iggy, Livingston, Javale, and maybe another big one that I'm forgetting about :))"

2368,2020-06-30 22:43:15,hip052,"I'm with you on Avery Bradley man, I think he's a great player and should be more of a steal than a bust at that position. I tried my best not to include my confirmation bias when evaluating, but Avery Bradley was actually one of the reasons I decided on a different approach. I didn't want to factor in value to the drafting team because there are cases when teams recognize the value of the player they draft but trade that player away for something better. For example I think the Clippers deserve credit for drafting Eric Bledsoe even if his stats with the Clippers weren't as great as they would later be. They used him as a trade piece because they recognized his value not because they wanted to move on, so I don't think they should be penalized for that.

I guess if I were to use maybe peak VORP would be better as you said instead of career VORP for evaluating a player's career, and that would make the Avery Bradley selection seem a lot better as it should. Thanks for the input!"

TJ Leaf was such a baffling pick. We knew the PG trade was imminent and we had weak depth on our wings regardless and OG was looking solid and coming out of IU. Would’ve been a good pick for the fans and press as well as a position of need. All around win. I guess the injury was a concern and winning is always the priority for the Pacers but I don’t get it.

He looks really promising at time and can explodes for a weeks or 2, but then all the sudden he fades into the background and totally disappears for the next couple weeks.  As a Canes fan, I have hope but he really needs to find some consistency.  For the sake of seeing the Spurs back where they “belong” they gotta hit on this next pick and keep Walker developing.  They have some good young guards so I’m expecting a wing or even a big here.  Maybe they get lucky in the lottery and Weissman falls.  I’m a big fan of taking bigs early too early, but Weissman has a ton of potential and there is nobody better than Pop to help him reach that."

2374,2020-07-01 05:41:33,hip052,"You know what that is actually an interesting approach. I have a feeling the results will be similar since the teams at the top generally didn't have too many negatives. I felt that averaging would let the magnitude of the hits and the magnitude of the misses matter, which was important since even when we normally evaluate teams we consider the big hits and the big misses more. Also due to variance there are a few slight negatives and slight positives who could go the other direction after another year and I'm not sure if having them count as much as a major hit or miss would be fair. I will try your approach and edit this comment later, if you are interested.

Also I did forget to give credit in the post but the statistics are from basketball reference, scraped using beautiful soup which is a python package, and the draft picks are from wikipedia since they had trade information which I wanted. Other python packages I used were numpy and scipy.stats for determining percentiles and averages. I did do the labeling of which pick was whose manually and it took me a while haha. But once I had that I used excel to calculate averages for each team and each round for both models."

Did Sac draft well by picking Whiteside and fail at development or using him to his strengths? Or did his time overseas/g-league/miami make him into that player?"
2377,2020-06-30 16:43:28,hip052,"I mean try telling a Hornets or Knicks or Kings fan that a 50 win team that only wins a round or two in the playoffs is meaningless. I certainly get that the end goal of any team is to win a title, but there is plenty of value in being a consistent top-6 seed in the playoffs - at the end of the day the NBA is an entertainment product, so while a 50 win regular season may not be the ultimate level of success, I would certainly consider it success."
2378,2020-06-30 17:16:55,hip052,"&#x200B;

Would you then not agree that most teams are unsuccessful? the metric you are evaluating success seems more anecdotal. I can see what you are getting at, but 50 plus wins is still a success.

I get that teams with the lower pick generally have decent success already, so its a bit harder to really evaluate the pick's contribution to the team. Its easier to see how a Ben Simmons and a Joel Embiid contribute than it is to see how a Delon Wright contributes. Lottery teams more aim for star players, where the lower picks usually aim for promising role players."
2379,2020-06-30 17:19:02,hip052,Please don’t  ever mention the defending champion Toronto Raptors as a team that never won anything thanks
2380,2020-07-01 08:02:46,hip052,Seems like you’re undervaluing teams that are consistently good. Kawhi was a major part of the raptors winning but so was a deep team full of good shooters and defenders that the raptors drafted. Only one team wins a year and getting deep into the playoffs is much better than being mediocre. The spurs also won this decade and have been a consistent playoff team. There’s value to that
2381,2020-07-01 05:12:09,hip052,"Hmm that's a good idea actually. I originally based it off of historical value of the draft position because that would tell a better story about the distribution of talent in the draft because it probably would not be simply linear, but I have dealt with overfitting as a result. Maybe just including additive smoothing would reduce this. 

For JV in particular, he was considered one of the Raptors' worst picks of the decade by VORP percentile, where 5th overall picks tended to be in the 95th percentile in VORP and JV was in the 84th percentile making him 10th in the class in VORP. He actually outperformed his draft position's expected WS contribution by 0.08% so the second model actually considered him a good value for the pick. I think JV being the Raptors' worst pick in the first model showed how the percentile-based approach was flawed and also was a testament to how well the Raptors have drafted."
2382,2020-06-30 21:46:39,hip052,"Yeah Anthony Davis rates super high on this as well, I think it's just a hiccup in the rating system."
2383,2020-07-01 05:28:43,hip052,"So my second model expects first overall picks to contribute around 25% of a draft's win shares if I'm not mistaken, and this is derived from averaging contributions by #1 overall picks from Pervis Ellison to Deandre Ayton to their respective draft class. KAT got a +5.36 rating which meant that he contributed to around 30% of his draft class's win shares, which is insane. He was not a steal because as you said, they didn't steal him from anybody and anybody (except the Jah fans) would have taken him at that position. Yet he has still outperformed his draft class by more than a #1 overall should by a lot, which is why his rating is so high. Should the T'Wolves be credited with selecting him if he was so obviously better and ended up fulfilling that potential? Maybe not. My model does its best to not give them *too* much credit by comparing him to #1 overall picks historically who have generally been great. But he's running laps around everyone else in his draft class in terms of counting and especially advanced stats because of how efficient he is and even factoring in his position he comes out as a great pick and hey, Minnesota could have Sam Bowie'd it so maybe they deserve some credit for not."
2384,2020-07-01 10:17:58,hip052,"Lots of #1 picks are way bigger misses than KAT and AD.

There needs to be a way to show the value of picking the right guy, too.

Otherwise you penalize way too heavily for a Fultz and a Bennett, and you don't provide enough separation between good second rounders that aren't really *that* great."
2385,2020-07-01 05:57:53,hip052,"This is true. The idea behind the analysis was that if teams have high value picks they should be getting high value players every time where as having a mid value pick does not necessarily mean they should get high value so when they do it is more impressive than teams with high picks. If a team has many high picks, they probably have not been using them well anyways (except I guess Boston or Philadelphia). I mean ideally a team would draft high once or twice and experience success and not have to draft high again for a while instead picking later in the draft. This is kinda what the Pacers do where their only lottery picks this decade have been Paul George and Myles Turner and the rest of their picks are either in the middle or end. 

Essentially, my response to you is that I consider nailing high picks and middle/end picks to be equally valuable, it's just that what the definition of nailing means changes."

The fact that he was able to get convince Gar Pax to look at so many late round picks that turned in to solid starting caliber NBA players is impressive, full stop. The fact that Gar Pax were mediocre with better draft slots *after* Lloyd left to be an assistant GM with Orlando should also count against the Bulls. Now Lloyd and Orlando did not have the same success but it's hard to tell if that's a difference in duties from head scout to assistant GM resulting in less scouting from Lloyd or if it adds merit to the idea that the Bulls just got lucky several years in a row with guys like Gibson, Butler, James Johnson, relative to guys like Teague, Portis, McDermott."

Those are higher than the Spurs have usually gotten to pick, but those are still guys that really move the needle, while, with yhe exception of Kawhi, the Spurs' finds are mostly decent rotation guys. Solid, for sure, but is getting Kyle Anderson at 30, really more impressive than picking up someone like MPJ at 14? Also, keep in mind that Denver's home run pick, Jokic, was picked up 11 picks after the Spurs took Anderson.

I'm not trying to bag on the Spurs. They still deserve to be high, but the list of real impact guys that Denver got well below where they should have gone is ridiculous."
2396,2020-06-30 22:05:53,hip052,Brandon Knight was also pretty solid. That’s a good pick
2397,2020-06-30 20:03:24,hip052,"I would contend he was a *FINE* as a starter but was viewed internally as a cornerstone, building-block player despite not having that value."
2398,2020-06-30 23:07:57,hip052,Darko really set y’all back
2399,2020-06-30 18:40:36,hip052,yes. finding a starter in the second round is a great pick. plays good to sometimes great defense and is a good passer. shooting and finishing is improving. could use a better handle. but overall is a solid player and the type of player you keep around when the team is actually good.
2400,2020-06-30 18:25:33,hip052,Dude is a solid improving NBA player who has quite a bit of two-way potential. He was definitely a great pick for the second round.
2401,2020-06-30 18:56:11,hip052,"While I'm not ready to call him a great player, considering his level now compared to where he was picked, I think it's safe to say he's a great value."
2402,2020-07-01 04:49:30,hip052,Probably missing pistons  games if you don’t think getting Bruce brown as a mid second rounder is a great pick
2403,2020-06-30 19:51:19,hip052,"Yup, that one is very flawed (as noted by OP). It had these guys listed as positives: Willie Warren (+46.37), Furkan Aldemir (+27.38).

Furkan Aldemir, a 53rd pick, played a total 41 games in the NBA. All for the 18 win Sixers and averaged 2.3/4.3/0.7."
2404,2020-06-30 18:23:30,hip052,"Yeah, I think the OP's analysis missed a lot of other factors, because obviously GSW had the best drafting skill just based on assembling their 73-9 team. Looney worked quite well for us, and now it looks like Paschall has a lot of potential."
2405,2020-06-30 22:05:47,hip052,"Looney? By what stretch of imagination does Looney warrant consideration in here. He is a decent role player from the bench at best, and does not contribute much except fills a need for GSW when they lack a big man.  As for the rest of their players during the championship runs, Warriors beefed up their bench with FAs from other teams who were chasing a ring, or came via trades. Think Iggy, Livingston, Lee, Bogut, and the 2x MVP Durant. So this is a good reflection of their drafting sucess in the last 10 years. Of course, if you arbitrarily add 2009 pick Curry into this calc, that would likely move the up the ranking."
2406,2020-06-30 20:22:59,hip052,It’s still mind blowing that Conley is the last first rounder they’ve taken to make it to a second contract with us
2407,2020-06-30 20:45:55,hip052,"If the Grizzlies could’ve found a half-decent 3-and-d wing (at either SG or SF) between 2008 and 2017, the Western conference could’ve looked a lot different.  Those teams were really really close to beating the Spurs and Thunder who both made the finals.  I’m a Heat fan so I’m my saying the Grizz ever win it all, but the Grizzlies grit-and-grind defense would certainly been an super tight battle.  Gasol on Bosh.  Tony Allen on Wade.  And I’m sure Allen would spend time covering Lebron too, which would’ve been amazing to watch.  I wonder if Gay could cover Lebron.  One article calls Chalmers one of the grit-and-grind players cuz he went to Memphis a couple years after.  It would be cool to see him and Conley go at it as both were gritty tough defenders.  I’m just reading now yang Battier was part of the Grit-and-grind era and helped kicked it off in 2010 right before coming to Miami for 2 rings.  Does he still make that switch if the Grizz are doing better.  What if the Heat can’t get him.  Battier is a good 3-and-d small forward.   That’s kinda crazy actually.   

The Heat big 3 era was the beginning of small ball taking over worn Bosh moving down from PF to C and Batteir coming in as stretch 4 instead of playing the 3 like he had always done.  I wonder how this matches up against ZBo and Gasol down low.  I love Battier, but he can he cover ZBo in the post all game?  Definitely not.  Does Lebron have to cover him?  Do you force us to use 35 year old Birdman for way too long or do we force you to sit ZBo."
2408,2020-07-01 09:45:55,hip052,"I've asked about downvotes before. It has to do w mobile vs desktop, and some other yadda yadda. I don't have a downvote button, whic is perfect! But I use old reddit on desktop w noScript, so who knows"
2409,2020-06-30 21:11:14,hip052,"Yeah, I think Walker has the highest ceiling of anyone on the current roster (there’s an argument for Dejounte Murray too). 

His athleticism is through the roof, and he already has a solid jumper and finishing ability. Hope he continues to develop and puts it all together.

Keldon Johnson is another Spurs player the jury is still out on. Murray/Walker/Johnson could be a formidable 1/2/3 in the future."
2410,2020-07-01 16:15:38,hip052,"Thanks! I would be interested in this type of approach, and I’m guessing that the results would be the same at the very top, with maybe one or two jumping or falling, but don’t feel super pressured to do it. I’m looking to teach myself a bit of python this summer, so I can run my own experiments like this, so thanks for sharing those tools, which I’m assuming need some experience"
2411,2020-07-01 00:12:02,hip052,Yeah I here ya they definitely go hand in hand. I was merely just wanting to see how the data looked with factoring in if said player didn’t really contribute to their drafted team.
2412,2020-06-30 21:48:05,hip052,"Yeah, or at least we should keep in mind that between what, say, the Blazers Ha e been these past 6 years and what my Hornets have been, I have no doubts whatsoever which one is more fun to watch, more fun to support,, and which will be remembered the most dearly by respective fanbases... Sure the ultimate goal is a championship, but as dumb as it seems, only 1 team gets to win it all every year, and I certainly wouldn't say the other 29 teams' seasons were all failures..."
2413,2020-06-30 17:44:32,hip052,"Indeed, while fans as a whole have a different conception for teams which is for them to be providers of entertainment, for owners it is to generate money and for GMs to generate championships.

Only one team can win every year, many can be entertaining,  but as you could see in an explicit version in Moreyball, for as long as they win, the aesthetic of the basketball is secondary to the Ws.

Most bad GMs don't provide nor entertainment nor wins, because they simply can't.. but their owners will surely judge on the win part.

It's a fools feel-good mistake to compare to dumpsters like NYC or CHA."
2414,2020-06-30 17:39:32,hip052,"Ok, I will mention the Kawhi Leonard raptors as a team that won a Championship.

Never forgetting the Kawhi Leonard part or the KD/Klay injury part."
2415,2020-07-01 08:28:12,hip052,"I define good as teams that go deep into the playoffs, which is the main criteria by owners on whether to shake things around or not.

I quite can't argue on a subjective topic as to what fans want as everyone is different, but to say the Raptors were good without having gone to any finals is to me very far fetched and inconsistent with what actually occurred.

 Were winning 55 regular seasons game enough so they wouldn't have traded DeMar for a one year rental of Kawhi, as winning 55+ every year should have been enough to keep everyone happy no?"
2416,2020-07-01 01:55:22,hip052,"Him too.  Great pick who has still outdone expectations.  He’s unequivocally the best big man in the NBA.  Still not a steal.  Anybody with the first pick would’ve taken him.  Nobody passed on him or didn’t want him.  MKG was a distant, distant 2nd pick.

Now, Damian Lillard going 6th is a steal.  MKG, Waiters, and Thomas Robinson were all picked before him lmao.  

I think one of the problems with this is it needs more specificity to draft class.  Like what about Beal at #3.  Yes he’s way better than MKG and clearly should’ve gone ahead, but Damian Lillard is better and clearly the #2 guy in the class.  Beal should’ve gone 3rd overall still."
2417,2020-07-01 06:22:54,hip052,"It's not just that. The model as is values picking a starter in the late teens / early twenties higher than picking an all-star top 5 basically. So much of drafting in the NBA is about marginal improvements. A player who performs 10% better than another is worth far more than 10% more. 

Also as a totally separate point, don't love win shares as a metric (especially defensive), which I think are changing some results. Can see an [analysis here](https://fansided.com/2019/01/08/nylon-calculus-best-advanced-stat/). Just as a prior, I have a hard time with a metric that ranks Jarrett Allen as 3 times the draft pick that Jayson Tatum was."
2418,2020-07-01 05:31:24,hip052,150 character minimum
2419,2020-06-30 21:25:45,hip052,"Yeah man me too. As a nova fan it’s been great to see some of those guys flourishing in the nba. I’d be interested in seeing what teams have signed the most impactful udfas in the last 10 years or so. Wesley Matthews comes to mind, ish smith, bazemore, fvv,"
2420,2020-07-01 22:31:25,hip052,"But in that example the Cavs did have something to do with who Lebron became eventually, he wasn't a bad player that turned around in Miami, he was an amazing player that realized his potential in Miami, Butler was great with the Bulls and showed in the other 3 teams what he was.

Roster construction is not black and white, the Bulls had a lot of contracts that were impossible to move due to the steep decline of the players and injuries, if they all would have stayed healthy then I can see the Rose, Noah, Deng and young Butler (and was it Boozer the last player?) contend for many years.

Anthony Davis as great as he is, was always getting injured in the playoffs and regular season and if not him, his team mates, while the Pels weren't contenders the lack of continuity stunted the growth and appeal of the team, is it really the team's fault that most players were out? The team was never bad on paper and at some points it was good enough to fight for home court advantage, but then one or two starters would get injured, miss 10 games and the season became a fight for the 8th spot.

What I meant by being another post is that is hard to quantify stuff like that and not a minor adjustment to the current post, OP was clear in that he didn't take into account anything other than results, because team development and good coaching are a thing, some players can rise despite those being negatives and others need the help of the whole system to become good, and others like Lebron in Miami, need a team in a big market willing to spend to get a ring, because there never was a doubt that Lebron, barring any big injury, was a sure fire top 25 player in history, even while in the Cavs."
2421,2020-06-30 23:28:27,hip052,Fair enough. I missed that.
2422,2020-06-30 21:44:38,hip052,He was a solid dependable *starter*. Around 2010 we had guys like Perkins and Bynum and Gasol and KG as C/PF in the finals - you didn't need range back then.
2423,2020-07-01 01:36:24,hip052,I have a hard time believing the pick not landing for Detroit from the Otis Thorpe trade in 1997 is what set the Pistons back this decade.
2424,2020-07-01 05:02:39,hip052,Can you really know if he is on the terrible pistons?
2425,2020-06-30 22:43:49,hip052,And again curry was drafted 09 so that impacts in the ranking of THIS decade
2426,2020-07-01 16:44:05,hip052,Warriors don’t beat the rockets in the playoffs the last two years without Looney
2427,2020-07-01 04:05:46,hip052,"Looney is a switchable center that can guard Harden and was pivotal for Golden State in 2018 and 2019 Playoffs. Him at that price, if he is healthy, is probably one of the biggest value contracts in the League. And you argument about FA's is just insane, every team in the league signes free agens or makes trade.

In 2015-2016 - 4/5 starting players were drafted by the Warriors - that 80%

In 2017-2019 - 3/5 starting players were drafted by the Warriors + Looney emerged 

There is hardly other team that drafted better than GSW this decade"
2428,2020-06-30 20:51:32,hip052,"Yeah, Battier was past his prime when he left for Heat. He was in Memphis for the early part of his career, was traded in the deal for Rudy Gay and ended up coming back later. Thing is, we had Rudy Gay who was supposed to be a star SF. Just never materialized. Didn't want it enough.

I maintain that if we had beat the Spurs and gotten to the Finals in 2013, we would've beat the Heat. You guys wouldn't have had an answer for Marc and Zbo, I think they would've feasted."
2429,2020-06-30 18:00:47,hip052,"Oh let’s go here again shall we? That is such a simplistic and naïve take on that championship I’m surprised to see it echoed here of all places.

The non kawhi raps made ecf twice and had the unfortunate, yet hardly unique, experience of running up against lebron 3x in 6 straight playoff runs. They are one of the top 3-4 teams in the league this year without kawhi and have 7 seasons with a winning record all while not picking higher than 9th and getting major contributions from pascal (24th, considered a reach), fvv (undrafted), norm Powell (46th, reigning ecpotw) OG (23rd) and Terence Davis (undrafted).

Most of the rest of the league would kill for this level of success."
2430,2020-06-30 20:05:32,hip052,"Well we better remove the Warriors 2015 and 2017 chips then (no Kyrie or KLove, no Kawhi), as well as Miami 2012 (DRose). Injuries happen."
2431,2020-06-30 18:19:22,hip052,"And the Raptors were and are a totally different team now minus Lowry... so what's your point?

Is it the Raptors fault Klay injured himself trying to embellish a call? Injuries happen. Raptors were missing OG as well a top 5 defender in the league this year..."
2432,2020-06-30 20:10:04,hip052,Sorry I was mistaken on when the injury occurred. I thought remembered Klay shooting a three and kicked his leg out to get a call and that's when he injured himself
2433,2020-06-30 21:27:01,hip052,Somebody drop this fool for me
2434,2020-07-01 13:23:27,hip052,"Okay but the raptors never would have won the championship without drafting well, like they did, so mentioning them as underachievers is just completely wrong and undermines the OP’s data, just because you’re salty that Kyle lowry’s thick ass won a chip"
2435,2020-07-01 19:07:04,hip052,"2 teams go to the finals though. It was cavs warriors for like 4 years in a row that doesn’t mean every other team is bad. I’d consider the Rockets to be a consistently great team as well but they never went to the finals. The raptors were able to be a championship team by being consistently good, and being in position to make a move to increase their ceiling. Good teams have that luxury. It’s the same position the 76ers are in now. A ceiling on their team due to a flawed makeup but if they add a well rounded star they can go the distance. 75% of the NBA can’t do that"
2436,2020-07-01 21:51:40,hip052,know what? that he's a good player? i mean it's not like he's the typical volume scorer getting buckets on a shit team. he does things that scale up when playing against good competition.
2437,2020-07-01 16:58:25,hip052,"Like I said GSW has always lacked defensive centers to counter the other team's bigs. That's why GSW's had rotating centers in the last decade - Bogut, McGee, Looney, a bunch of other big bodies seldom used and an assortment of smallball Cs like David West. But being a bit role player don't mean significant contribution to the run."
2438,2020-07-01 16:38:06,hip052,"Denial is unbelievable. Look at the roster. Curry was in 2009, in the 00s. Klay and Green in the 2010s decade, the decade in question. After Green, Barnes contributed a bit, but not during the run, and the rest are bench role players. Only three drafted players made contributions to playoff runs: Curry, Green, Klay. Looney is bench. Looney able to guard Harden? Not even in your dreams pal. He won't be starting  on any other playoff team except Warriors who's always had a weakness at center. Take a look at GSW DRAFT: https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/draft.html"
2439,2020-06-30 20:57:20,hip052,"I don’t know either way.  We can’t cover those guys in the post, but the Warriors and Rockets have been taking bigs out of games with small ball.  I wonder which one wins.  

And Tony Allen is slightly small for Lebron and might be covering Wade more.  How are the Grizzlies supposed to stop Lebron?"
2440,2020-06-30 20:06:48,hip052,"Remains a bad comparison man, you're comparing god damn OG Anunoby to KD.

We're talking about a Lebron level player, not an at best 3rd team All NBA."
2441,2020-06-30 19:14:13,hip052,"Not their fault, but to compare any player on the raptors to KD being injured is laughable.

Probably not champions again in decades though."
2442,2020-07-01 15:20:45,hip052,"You can disagree with one example but I can mention probably over 8 teams with the same problem.

Whether or not I respect the Raptors, doesn't undermine the fact that there is a huge difference between regular season overachievers (this post) and actual champions.

The Utah Jazz drafts very well if you're looking to win games during the regular season.. whereas you have teams like the Heatles where most of the pieces were drafted elsewhere.

Putting regular season success, which is literally achievable by half the league, in the same boat as championship level teams does a disservice to what a championship entails.

So yes, even comparing Kawhi raptors to DeMar raptors makes no sense.. one team with an ""imported"" player did what it is built to do, which is not , I repeat regular season success."
2443,2020-07-01 17:06:53,hip052,"You speak nonsense:

1. Bogut in 2014-2016 will start for most of the teams in the League
2. Bogut, Mcgee and Looney are completely different players with different qualities and roles
3. Looney was amazing in 2018 and 2019. Its obvious you didn't watched series with Rockets or him particular. If he becomes available 29/29 teams will approach him"
2444,2020-07-01 17:02:17,hip052,"Show me one team that drafted overal better players than: Klay, Dray, Barnes, Looney, Parschal?

Looney was wanted by all teams last summer, including Houston, he is an AMAZING defender given his position and qualities.

Barnes contributed a bit?! By starting for one of the best teams in history?
And what about Curry being drafted in 2009? He is not in that disscusion but he is in the one that GSW won mainly because of their drafting"
2445,2020-06-30 21:39:31,hip052,"TA spent years terrorizing KD, I think he would’ve done fine on LeBron that series, with Conley on Wade. Doesn’t matter ultimately."
2446,2020-06-30 20:10:11,hip052,Sure you're replying to the right comment? Merely pointing out that plenty of championships have been swung by catastrophic injuries to other hopefuls.
2447,2020-06-30 20:13:07,hip052,"I wasn't comparing KD to OG. I was just mentioning that we had a significant injury as well. 

KD is great and all but the series definitely goes 7 games if he was  a more ""resilient player"" and who knows from there."
2448,2020-07-01 17:36:00,hip052,Bogut was NOT drafted Warriors. We are talking about DRAFTING ABILITY. Heck teams will approach looney because he is a servicable bench player. He won't get a starting job anywhere for 80 games in the NBA nope. He did good in Rockets series because Warriors needed someone to counter Clint who was killing you guys on the board. Dray couldn't handle Clint. And one series appearance don't count as over-all consistent contribution like starting player. Sure you're in love with him because he's on your team which has lacked consistent reliable big men in this past decade but you can't see the forest for the trees.
2449,2020-07-01 17:22:11,hip052,"Parschal? A volume scorer on a lottery team without any shooters this past year? A defensive sieve who's net rating was -10? When you look at rookies' advanced stats, he's not in top 10. #20 in rookie offensive rating. #22 in rookies defensive rating. #23 in net rating. Only 24 rookies played 15 minutes or more a game in this season; he came in 23rd in net, #20 in offensive rating. Not one we'd pin championships on. 
 Barnes was a high draft pick that wasn't as effective as hoped for (that's why he was shipped out) and was not around when the run began. I give credit for GSW landing Curry, Klay and Dray, but after that, drafts have been laughable. Roster was constructed with value-added FAs and trades. Looney an amazing defender? I have never seen him play amazing on defense, nor have I read ANYWHERE that analysts rate him as an amazing defender. He is adequate, and he is mobile enough for center-challenged Warriors, but not more than an average role player."
2450,2020-06-30 23:26:01,hip052,"Conley is good cover for Wade too and KD is more of a perimeter player than Bron is.  KD still really skinny and that was younger KD who was even skinnier and less muscular and just less developed.  KD really hit his absolute peak after the big 3 was over and maybe by the last year of grit-and-grind.  That finals loss and then not getting back made KD and much better player.  Bron is way bigger and stronger and was really in the perfect prime of his career.  Can’t compare KD right before his prime to peak Bron in terms of physically, experience, and control of the game."

2466,2020-06-29 20:37:20,hi7z30,From 2-0 down versus Cheltenham to winning the League Two Final. Incredible stuff from the Cobblers.

On the other, hahahaha"
2468,2020-06-29 20:36:41,hi7z30,"The fact it ended 4-0 is just amazing. The season doesn’t end in October!

Enjoy the trip to Barrow next year!

Congrats Cobblers, enjoyed my trip to Sixfields last year, hopefully I’ll be there again if allowed!"
2469,2020-06-29 20:57:14,hi7z30,"So pleased for Alan McCormack. Thats 3 promotions in 3 seasons for him now with 2 of them with us. The guy is just a natural leader and proper winner. 

Feel for Exeter a bit as they are always in amongst it in League 2 but never quite there. Got dominated tonight unfortunately for them."

Hope we can hang on to a few players this time, its a good bunch of lads. Last time we went up Chris Wilder left to go to Sheffield United (understandable) and our squad got gutted"
2481,2020-06-29 22:16:01,hi7z30,It was as if the Exeter players forgot that this was a promotion playoff game
2482,2020-06-29 22:42:06,hi7z30,"So pleased to get promotion but we are the weakest team going up and we had a very shaky start to the season. I'd like for us to be established in league 1 instead of the constant yo-yoing up and down that we've done over the last decade or so. Gonna need money for that, which we certainly dont have! Gotta feel for Exeter too, what a shit relationship they have with wembley."

2494,2020-06-29 20:29:56,hi7z30,It wasn't *that* long ago that we won one...
2495,2020-06-30 00:20:02,hi7z30,"Don’t worry, I read today that teams playing in red and white in EFL Play Off Finals have lost the last 31 games.

Brentford better aim for 2nd place!"

2507,2020-06-29 21:58:33,hi7z30,As long as it’s above the scum couldn’t care
2508,2020-06-29 21:33:08,hi7z30,"Yes, take the teams round. Soften em up before we beat em."
2509,2020-06-30 00:22:11,hi7z30,Southend got relegated mate
2510,2020-06-30 06:16:57,hi7z30,"I mean you were well organised in defence and have a few tidy players going forward, can't deny that, but we never turned up in the first place."
2511,2020-06-30 05:28:43,hi7z30,The National Lift Tower welcomes losers too!

2513,2020-06-29 19:19:56,hi5ixv,Probably the most free headers I've ever seen in the box. Exeter's keeper should be beyond livid with this defense.
2514,2020-06-29 19:50:03,hi5ixv,Moxey you utter bellend
2515,2020-06-29 19:03:04,hi5ixv,UP THE SHOE ARMY!!!!
2516,2020-06-29 19:10:03,hi5ixv,Exeter's keeper has every right to be pissed off there how many headers are they losing in their own box
2517,2020-06-29 19:01:18,hi5ixv,"Ah fuck, League 2 KDB going off. Really important player for ntown."
2518,2020-06-29 19:10:25,hi5ixv,Couple of good stops from maxted
2519,2020-06-29 19:16:52,hi5ixv,Bowman mate what was that...
2520,2020-06-29 19:17:58,hi5ixv,"Maxted again, wow."
2521,2020-06-29 19:18:33,hi5ixv,Exeter getting rinsed in the air
2522,2020-06-29 19:41:49,hi5ixv,"I don't know why Moxey doesn't just twat it in from half way for old times sake.

EDIT: Not quite what I had in mind that."
2523,2020-06-29 19:50:18,hi5ixv,Well that's game over it's safe to say
2524,2020-06-29 18:57:33,hi5ixv,"Come on, you Cobblers!!!!"
2525,2020-06-29 19:02:20,hi5ixv,Yes you beautiful ginger bastard! Come back next season on loan again please
2526,2020-06-29 19:50:17,hi5ixv,Well that's fucked it a little more.
2527,2020-06-29 20:02:28,hi5ixv,Horrific giveaway but just lay it off fuck me
2528,2020-06-29 20:12:08,hi5ixv,"Killed that off, league one hear we come!"
2529,2020-06-29 19:17:38,hi5ixv,Bowman... come on
2530,2020-06-29 19:22:00,hi5ixv,This Max Teddybear guy is really good.
2531,2020-06-29 19:24:56,hi5ixv,If I were Maxted I'd be chewing out my teammates at halftime.
2532,2020-06-29 19:44:40,hi5ixv,Goode has been excellent
2533,2020-06-29 20:05:28,hi5ixv,Exeter showing an excellent example of self sabotage tonight
2534,2020-06-29 20:20:58,hi5ixv,It'll be a good one for Exeter if they win this
2535,2020-06-29 20:26:24,hi5ixv,Never switched back on after conceding the first goal sigh
2536,2020-06-29 18:29:04,hi5ixv,Hoping exeter finally get this one!
2537,2020-06-29 18:42:41,hi5ixv,Haha oh fucking hell that’s rough for Exeter
2538,2020-06-29 18:28:31,hi5ixv,LETS GO EXETER!
2539,2020-06-29 19:50:37,hi5ixv,Awful challenge
2540,2020-06-29 20:12:25,hi5ixv,I wanted an away trip to Exeter next season as it's boring to go to Northampton. Only way to avoid it would be winning the playoffs but that isn't happening.
2541,2020-06-29 18:37:24,hi5ixv,Really hope Exeter win. Not just because I’ve always liked them as a club but it would be horrible to lose 3 of the last 4 play-off finals!
2542,2020-06-29 18:46:36,hi5ixv,Pain.
2543,2020-06-29 18:53:10,hi5ixv,GK did get the ball first but Vadaine straight up caught a fist to the face.
2544,2020-06-29 19:02:56,hi5ixv,Gonna be a big ask for Exeter now.
2545,2020-06-29 19:23:20,hi5ixv,"first half to forget for ECFC.  Got to close down space and stop letting the crosses get in, and contest the headers in the box."
2546,2020-06-29 19:40:44,hi5ixv,"Bloody hell I can't sit still in my chair. Trying not to get carried away, we've lost 2-0 leads this season..."
2547,2020-06-29 20:19:56,hi5ixv,"Well, this is a hiding..."
2548,2020-06-29 20:20:06,hi5ixv,"Bloody hell Paul Anderson, thought he was retired or gone missing."
2549,2020-06-29 18:43:18,hi5ixv,That one hurts
2550,2020-06-29 19:03:46,hi5ixv,Poor Exeter
2551,2020-06-29 20:12:52,hi5ixv,Good time for a comeback...
2552,2020-06-29 19:57:39,hi5ixv,Last game in a City shirt. This is the worst we've played all season. Always bottle it at Wembley.
2553,2020-06-29 19:04:04,hi5ixv,Real shame been integral all season
2554,2020-06-29 19:17:27,hi5ixv,And another one! That would have been game over
2555,2020-06-29 19:18:11,hi5ixv,Not even getting the shot away there is shocking
2556,2020-06-29 20:06:28,hi5ixv,This is some real Monkey's Paw stuff
2557,2020-06-29 19:53:07,hi5ixv,"Nah, we're just lulling them into a false sense of security."
2558,2020-06-29 20:05:21,hi5ixv,I've seen hoskins finishing enough down the years to be ok with morton not squaring that
2559,2020-06-29 18:30:21,hi5ixv,Third times the charm!
2560,2020-06-29 18:43:17,hi5ixv,They really are cursed in play offs
2561,2020-06-29 19:53:47,hi5ixv,I'm pretty sure it went more or less as intended to be fair.
2562,2020-06-29 20:14:55,hi5ixv,I fancy a weekend away in Oxford. Will probably be a Tuesday night game though.
2563,2020-06-29 18:58:15,hi5ixv,Same for both teams believe it or not
2564,2020-06-29 18:59:57,hi5ixv,"What I thought too tbh. If that's two outfield players and an elbow to the face or sth while jumping for the ball, foul all day long"
2565,2020-06-29 19:04:57,hi5ixv,"It's fine, we'll catch them in the second leg."
2566,2020-06-29 19:45:24,hi5ixv,"Yeah we're not the best at sitting deep and holding on, so i hope keep the mentality right"
2567,2020-06-29 20:21:43,hi5ixv,Team switched off ages ago.
2568,2020-06-29 19:05:21,hi5ixv,"Gutted for him as well, he tried to play on but definitely needed to go off. Would have been nice for him to be on the pitch at the end though."
2569,2020-06-29 19:20:23,hi5ixv,"The guys getting a work out tonight.

Exeters defending on anything aerial has been really poor. Its no secret how we play at this point"
2570,2020-06-29 22:18:45,hi5ixv,"""just fooking square it!!!"" i heard. sorry sam but no"
2571,2020-06-29 18:32:15,hi5ixv,Certainly hope so!  Cardboard me is excited to see exeter and to attend a match at Wembly!
2572,2020-06-29 19:59:10,hi5ixv,"Don't doubt it. 

I can understand the frustration, but with his experience its inexcusable to be so stupid."
2573,2020-06-29 20:16:34,hi5ixv,"I mean it's handy having another away day so close, I just like going in a different direction which Exeter would have provided. Anything to avoid yet another away trip up the M6"
2574,2020-06-29 19:07:10,hi5ixv,"That replay was quite sad.

I'm hoping its that he knows his body well enough to know carrying on would be bad. Especially after the knee bother a couple of years ago"
2575,2020-06-29 20:17:28,hi5ixv,That is true. Was looking at a map of next season's L2 clubs and our closest games would have been Cambridge and Walsall. I'm based in Huntingdon so the former is fine with me but it's looking very northern.
2576,2020-06-29 20:19:09,hi5ixv,"Yeah, it feels exciting whenever our coaches don't head towards the North. I feel like I know the route past Stoke as well as a lorry driver there's so many teams up there."

2609,2020-06-27 22:37:16,hh30o8,Don’t know what to think. But I’ve always been a big fan of big Sam and he could probably have turned our season around a few months ago. But now might be too late
2610,2020-06-28 04:14:57,hh30o8,"I have no mixed feelings at all. Had the Premier League not been paused, he would have been sacked after the Chelsea match, and rightfully so. The suspension bought him more time which served to benefit nobody but Smith.

With 6 matches left, if they hire anyone it’ll be with Championship football in mind. Hard to believe that at 27 points after 32 matches we’re still in this being only one point from safety. Has anyone of note come available recently?

Yes, the front office bears responsibility, but Deano is out of his league. He inherited a phenomenal Championship level squad and got lucky. A top caliber manager could have kept us mid-table, I really believe that."
2611,2020-06-28 05:24:01,hh30o8,"With luck, Liverpool will give their kids a chance now they've won the league and we can beat the Hammers. Maybe 4 points. I don't think we should fear Man U or Arsenal, but thing is both of 'em can score goals.

If Smith's on his bike, I can't think who's free to replace him."
2612,2020-06-28 09:26:57,hh30o8,"He's only evens with sky bet to be the next manager to leave. If there was any hint of truth to these rumours, I'd expect him to be odds on. I very much doubt he's leaving today."
2613,2020-06-28 01:51:12,hh30o8,"We are definitely going down under Smith so there’s nothing to lose, a lot of people blame the players for what are faults of bad coaching just because he is a Villa fan"
2614,2020-06-28 04:17:14,hh30o8,"I know a few West Ham supporters that would cut off their left testicle at this point for Big Sam. You think Deano is bad (and he is), try supporting a club with Moyes at the helm. Half of the hammer’s fan base is suicidal at the moment."

2646,2020-08-19 15:45:47,iclfgi,"I think it's because it's the last time in our collective memories that things felt ""good""."
2647,2020-08-19 15:28:49,iclfgi,"I think it’s a normal feeling as you get older (I’m 27 and already feeling this way). Older people say it all the time: it has been 20 years already! Or: I still feel like *insert younger age*. When you’re younger everything is new and a big deal and now it’s mostly eat, sleep, work, repeat."
2648,2020-08-19 11:58:28,iclfgi,"I agree and have had similar thoughts.

9/11 is seared in our consciousness.  It was so frightening, so unpredicted and the imagery is so horrific.  Time has not done much to dull the memories for those of us who watched it all unfold.

Also your point about the media. Totally agree!  Young people who weren't alive during the first run of iconic series are watching.  They are cultural touchstones that shine on thanks to streaming."
2649,2020-08-19 16:39:21,iclfgi,"Because the 90s were very recent.

*sticks fingers in ears and closes eyes*"
2650,2020-08-19 13:28:31,iclfgi,My theory is that there is so much over-information and stimulus keeping our minds occupied that the passing of time (maybe even human maturation) seems different than before. If we knew how much time we spent in front of screens and how much irrelevant “seemingly unregistered” information we browse through every day... maybe that’s where the feeling of missing time is.
2651,2020-08-19 17:11:23,iclfgi,For me it feel is like so long ago. I was born in 83 so I experienced both decades before the new millennium.  9/11 definetly was a turning point especially for me because I was in the Cory that day.  Things like social media and iPhones and all this technology has really made things completely different and not for the better IMO
2652,2020-08-19 15:48:01,iclfgi,"I think it's just because the turn of the millennium feels like a transition point from then to now. Most people don't really think about culture of the 2000's, or the 2010's. At least not in the same light that they think of culture in the 80's and 90's.  


Also, my personal opinion is that we haven't really progressed as fast as we used to compared to the 90's. Yes, social media has gotten extremely popular, but aside from that and smartphones, nothing else seems to have changed as much. Cars still have the same styling that they had in 2010, TV's essentially look the same as they did in the late 00's."
2653,2020-08-19 17:01:02,iclfgi,"eh, they feel like another lifetime to me. momentous geopolitical events are happening at such a dizzying rate that the world is basically unrecognizable from what it looked like in the 90s. That and technological penetration."
2654,2020-08-19 19:39:04,iclfgi,IDK. I Just recently got over thinking a decade ago was 1990-something.
2655,2020-08-21 15:08:13,iclfgi,"I’m 38 and the 90s feel like last decade to me.

However the early to mid 2000s feel like decades ago."
2656,2020-08-23 03:53:27,iclfgi,"I know this post is a couple days old now but I have one theory: A lot of us Millennials haven't grown up, in the traditional sense. We're in our 30s and still have no money, not buying houses, not putting money away for retirement, many of us are still living with roommates or parents, etc. We haven't gained much ground politically. Recession after recession. It's like time just hasn't moved on for us. At least that's how I feel."
2657,2020-08-20 14:24:46,iclfgi,The 90s feels like ages ago to me personally.
2658,2020-08-19 19:13:19,iclfgi,"Absolutely. I stand by my beliefs that the 90s were the last good decade to be a teenager/young adult. 

No terrorism color code threat of the day, helicopter parents galore, rash of school shootings (minus Columbine), a little less dirty politics, etc.."
2659,2020-08-19 17:50:58,iclfgi,I agree with this wholeheartedly
2660,2020-08-21 02:30:16,iclfgi,"I think 2020 will be remembered as the death of whatever the hell 2000-2019 was supposed to be called. We never collectively agreed on a name. In 20 years there will be reddit posts about how awesome the 2010s were, made by kids who are like 9 years old right now. I bet they’ll even go on about how 2020 was great. All the bad aspects of their memories will have faded while the good memories will live strong. I think that’s just how humans remember things."
2661,2020-08-21 15:32:08,iclfgi,Lol I kinda understand
2662,2020-08-21 02:47:59,iclfgi,"Could be. But I wouldn't bunch in the 00's with the 10's. The 00's were still in my eyes a continuation of the 90's for the most part. Things only started to change with the iPhone and social media starting to get out of control. Of course the 90's optimism wasn't there as the world was in pretty rough shape with 9/11, the war on terror, and the 08 market crash."
2663,2020-08-18 06:19:18,ibtutq,I just listen to jazz and classical these days. Even though some of the songs are about love its ok because they are instrumentals.
2664,2020-08-18 13:03:23,ibtutq,"I’ve always enjoyed instrumental music the most.  Classical is great.  New age-y stuff is perfect for background for meditating.

2665,2020-08-18 22:47:50,ibtutq,I mostly listen to anime openings cause if you can't understand the lyrics they can't remind me of anything.

2680,2020-08-18 00:24:50,iboxx2,"3 most important things this season:

1. Yanda's replacement has to be at least decent.

2. The pass rush has to be much improved, can't bank on being ahead and blitzing all day.

3. One of Miles Boykin/Devin Duvernay/James Proche/?Dez Bryant? needs to put up decent numbers, because right now it's just Hollywood and Snead as our only proven WRs."

2687,2020-08-18 01:07:24,iboxx2,I’m a secondary Ravens fan and I give the Dobbins pick an A+. Best RB in this draft and my pick to win OROY.
2688,2020-08-18 15:37:57,iboxx2,"I believe the Ravens can win *less* games this year but still be a better team than they were last year.  It's incredibly hard to go 14-2 or better in consecutive years, but I think the Ravens win 11-13 games, but are a much more complete team than they were last year.

They had probably the best overall draft on paper this past April.  They've added Derek Wolfe and Calais Campbell - two incredibly disruptive pieces to their defensive line - and addressed their weaknesses through the draft and free agency.

Lamar is still Lamar - a transcendent talent who improves as the years go on (at least, that's what he did in college).  They still have the best coaching staff in the AFC North, and a top 3 overall coaching staff.  

My prediction?  12-4, #1 AFC seed, and Lamar repeats as MVP.  This Ravens team has no real weakness I can see."
2689,2020-08-18 00:03:56,iboxx2,"> Week 15: Jaguars
Prediction: Win
Calais gets to catch up with some old friends while sitting on the bench watching the Ravens offense pound the rock. Ravens cruise to victory.

I think this is the trap game, not the Colts. I just think Rivers is washed and didn’t fall into a significantly better situation than he had in LA. The suspected offense gameplanning in Jax will be much different from last year, supposedly featuring much more play-action. Minshew was the second best QB during play-action behind Ryan Tannehill, and if the LB corps for the Ravens isn’t completely shored up, they might have a field day. Add to that, every few years they seem to completely whip our ass, so I see that game as an L for our boys"

2698,2020-08-17 23:56:38,iboxx2,"Let’s see

Browns: Loss. They’ve had your number the last couple seasons. When you have a team’s number you play with a sense you can do no wrong. 

Texans: Loss. I think people are going to be shocked how much better Watson plays when he isn’t trying to get the ball to one guy every time he drops back.

Chiefs: Loss. The defending champs roll.

Washington: Win. WFT d line gives the offense fits all day but your defense forces key turnovers and a score to get out with the W

Bengals: Win in blowout fashion. 

Eagles: Win. Your DL sets the tone early and doesn’t let up.

Steelers: Loss. It looks like a surprise now, but it won’t be at this point in the season when MVP front runner Big Ben torches your vaunted secondary.

Colts: Loss. Another surprise team that won’t be a surprise by this point of the season.

Patriots: Win. Remember what I said about having a team’s number?

Titans: Win, but by the skin of their teeth. Missing Casey in the middle is the difference maker.

Steelers: Loss, but in a much closer game than the earlier one.

Cowboys: Loss. Dak is in a contract year and the Boys look like the crown jewel of the NFC East this year.

Browns: Win, because Cleveland will be trying to make a push for the final wildcard spot and needs this win bad. Nothing like spoiling a rival’s chances.

Jags: Win in one of the fastest games in NFL history that breaks combined rushing records.

Giants: Loss. Danny Dimes proves he’s for real and shreds that secondary to the tune of 300+ and 4 touchdowns. 

Bengals: in a meaningless game to end a disappointing season, Joe Burrow leads the team down the field for a game winning field goal.

Final record 7-9, projected third AFC North.

2699,2020-08-17 23:28:26,iboxx2,Agreed. It has become my most anticipated matchup. Two strong explosive teams
2700,2020-08-17 23:38:28,iboxx2,I was so upset.....I had tickets to that game. Then because of COVID they canceled all the tickets. I knew that was going to be the best game of the season. I was really looking forward to seeing it in person.
2701,2020-08-17 23:51:15,iboxx2,From a neutral observer you guys have gone 2-0 against them the last two years and are a tough matchup on paper for them. Both close games though. Looks like a coin toss but Id lean Chiefs
2702,2020-08-17 23:17:55,iboxx2,I look forward to it. It's always close and exciting
2703,2020-08-18 02:13:15,iboxx2,I'm calling it now: it'll be the game of the year no matter who wins.
2704,2020-08-18 17:39:42,iboxx2,"Mahomes is basically QB Jesus. It’s a near guaranteed loss in my book. Unless your defense regresses to 2018 level, it might not be competitive."
2705,2020-08-18 00:06:58,iboxx2,"Their offense and the Steelers defense I suspect will have a very similar situation, in that they played so far above what they should have it will be very difficult to repeat, even with personnel improvements"
2706,2020-08-18 15:31:33,iboxx2,Derek Henry has that effect.
2707,2020-08-18 15:36:05,iboxx2,I feel good about Boykin. He's a year 2 now and had flashes last year.
2708,2020-08-18 20:13:33,iboxx2,sorry
2709,2020-08-18 02:41:18,iboxx2,"I loved both Queen and Dobbins coming out of the draft. Dobbins is gonna feast with Lamar. Queen needs to develop, but your guys coaching staff is fantastic at getting raw players to play up to their potential. I could really see a Colts/Pats type of rivalry forming between the Chiefs and Ravens. It's going to be great for football but terrible for my liver."
2710,2020-08-18 12:06:16,iboxx2,For me the trap game is @philly. Carson wentz is a good QB and playing at philly is tough. Wouldn’t shock me if that was the game we dig a small hole at the beginning and just can’t seem to do anything to get out.
2711,2020-08-18 06:42:42,iboxx2,"Roughly, yeah."
2712,2020-08-18 16:11:18,iboxx2,800 pounds of force and fury...

2714,2020-08-18 14:07:33,iboxx2,"It's definitely possible, ultimately I think the post season is where their goals are so just getting there healthy is the main focus."
2715,2020-08-18 14:05:22,iboxx2,"I wouldn't say they had the top two, with players like Isaiah Simmons and Kenneth Murray going to other teams, but I do think they snagged the best duo of any team, Harrison and Queen compliment each other really well."
2716,2020-08-18 15:30:56,iboxx2,"August is the month when hope springs eternal.  That said, I think 12 wins for the Ravens is pretty non-controversial."
2717,2020-08-18 15:15:30,iboxx2,I assume that a pass defense coordinator is involved in deciding how certain coverages are played and how/when things are passed off. Db coach is mostly gonna be concerned with technique.
2718,2020-08-17 23:12:37,iboxx2,Have you not been paying attention to the other reviews?

2720,2020-08-17 23:27:08,iboxx2,"He pointed at issues the ravens may have, like the inexperienced linebackers  and the loss of Yanda. They lost barely any starters, have the same coaching staff, and went 14-2 last year.  He also consistently brought up the loss to Tennessee last year.  Now I understand that it was in the context of fixing the issues the Ravens had in that game.... but that's what a good front office does."
2721,2020-08-17 23:15:45,iboxx2,"Well Debbie Downer, please enlighten us with all the bad that was missed?"
2722,2020-08-17 23:18:12,iboxx2,"I know as a Browns fan, you can't even expect other Browns fans to muster up anything good about that dumpster fire of a franchise, but Raven's fans can generally expect most functionally minded people to find greatness in the Ravens; basically, this would have been a similar write up no matter who wrote it without bias."
2723,2020-08-17 23:23:00,iboxx2,"Mmm, delicious salt"
2724,2020-08-17 23:13:34,iboxx2,A post on the ravens reviewed by a browns fan and it's salty. Imagine that
2725,2020-08-18 01:10:06,iboxx2,"Keep it up, it's a good look"
2726,2020-08-17 23:48:47,iboxx2,"I thought it was pretty well written and fair. We all have our favorites and biases. 

Like the username though"

2728,2020-08-18 00:03:25,iboxx2,"I mean, I don't think the Ravens are a 16-0 squad by any means but I have a hard time seeing them going 7-9.  It would be an incredible failure on all fronts."
2729,2020-08-18 00:08:12,iboxx2,"Not gonna lose early in the year. Our team always dominates in the pre-season, which should translate to early success especially vs a Browns team with new coaches."
2730,2020-08-18 00:01:16,iboxx2,RemindMe! 4 months
2731,2020-08-18 05:57:29,iboxx2,"Let's see

Browns: You don't know what ""having a teams number"" means. the past 3 years the Ravens and Browns split games and prior to that it leans Ravens. Please research before you state nonsense.

Texans: Hopkins had 12 targets that game, the 2nd receiver had 7. This is pretty normal for a #1 receiver especially one of his talent. There was no forcing the ball and Watson will be throwing to a weaker group this time around.

Steelers: Roethlisberger is 1 year older coming off a season ending injury to his throwing arm. With his style of playing football he will be lucky to play the full year. The Steelers will win because of their defense not their offense, they will be torching nobody.

Cowboys: Are a terrible road team more often than not. People seem to forget that McCarthy had his issues too, such as an inability to adapt and he is coming from Aaron Rodgers to Dak Prescott, there is a drop off in talent even considering Rodgers being in his later years.

Giants: Are playing for a top pick. Daniel Jones going to do what with who playing at the WR position? Quit playing.

&#x200B;

Overall your predictions are trash. Can i see the Ravens losing some of those game? Yes but not for the reasons you gave because your reasons are garbage.

RemindMe! 4 months"
2732,2020-08-18 05:00:37,iboxx2,RemindMe! 138 days
2733,2020-12-18 00:14:56,iboxx2,"So were third in the AFC north for now, we’ve already surpassed the win total. And making a good push for the playoffs. I gotta say, these last 3 games should be EZ"
2734,2021-01-03 21:31:42,iboxx2,Showing reciepts eh?
2735,2021-01-04 23:21:45,iboxx2,">Hate on me all you want, I’ll be saving responses and showing receipts at season’s end.

So where you at then? Talking all that shit lmao"
2736,2020-08-18 00:38:30,iboxx2,I'd lean Chiefs too if it was at home (even few fans) or neutral site. But there in Baltimore you just don't know.
2737,2020-08-18 05:07:06,iboxx2,i think it will be a better defensive game than it will be offensive. I think some freak of nature happens where washington and NYG end up with like a 60-62 game lol
2738,2020-08-18 20:12:34,iboxx2,Jesus was only mortal lol
2739,2020-08-19 18:36:11,iboxx2,The differences between being good and being elite might rest on what we get out of Miles Boykin and Jaylon Ferguson.  They're the young players most likely to step up into our biggest needs.
2740,2020-08-18 05:33:18,iboxx2,Except we like the Ravens <3
2741,2020-08-19 03:58:07,iboxx2,Is playing at Philly tough when there are no fans at the game?
2742,2020-08-18 23:15:23,iboxx2,"I forgot about Simmons (something, something tweeter). Still solid picks, IMO Murray and Harrison were neck and neck."
2743,2020-08-18 15:35:25,iboxx2,"Yeah Ravens at 12 wins is fine. I think ESPN has the same issue with their team by team schedule predictions, lots of optimism but in reality there aren't enough wins to go around."
2744,2020-08-18 15:40:36,iboxx2,"It means very little but we're coming off 14-2, have the easiest projected SOS and I think we don't travel a lot again. Chips are falling that way but we obviously won't know till the games happen."
2745,2020-08-18 00:39:20,iboxx2,Oh I don’t know how good or bad they will be. I mean I want them to fail miserably but it is what it is
2746,2020-08-18 00:36:19,iboxx2,Oh I don’t care.
2747,2020-08-17 23:35:08,iboxx2,The tastiest tears are those cried from Steelers fans.
2748,2020-08-18 00:15:21,iboxx2,"His review would have been a 15 page dissertation on Derrick Henry and the single win the Browns have against Lamar, ignoring our personnel, offseason and projecting 0-16 this year. Wouldn’t have made the cut"
2749,2020-08-18 01:13:56,iboxx2,I will always wish hate on the other teams in the division and if you say you don’t you are lying.
2750,2020-08-18 00:39:47,iboxx2,Hah thanks. Fuck them and Go Browns.
2751,2020-08-18 00:09:23,iboxx2,"Tough schedule. You guys beat up on some bottom feeders last year, with the exception of the Patriots, but I’d argue that was the worst Patriots team since 2002"
2752,2020-08-18 00:13:11,iboxx2,So you dominate vanilla schemes and scrubs? What an accomplishment.
2753,2020-08-18 06:35:28,iboxx2,"The Browns are the only team in the league that have proven they can slow down Lamar more than once.

Texans: Do you know how many sacks Watson took last year waiting for Hopkins to get to the top of his routes? Those don’t go in the book as targets.

I am a huge believer in Big Ben coming back, but I’ll concede that this prediction could easily make me eat crow, that said, I’m standing by my prediction Ben is a top 3 QB next year.

McCarthy was a god at getting his team ready to play out of conference foes on the road."
2754,2020-08-18 01:12:03,iboxx2,"Yeah but no fans, so idk how much home field matters"
2755,2020-08-18 08:24:12,iboxx2,"Yeah, imo the real matchup is between our secondary (best in the league) against the Chiefs passing (best in the league)."
2756,2020-08-18 08:25:59,iboxx2,"Maybe it hasn't been long enough yet, but even after losing to you guys twice, I don't hate the Chiefs even a fraction as much as I hate the Steelers/Pat's, who we swept last year.

It's actually cool to see another QB with similar accolades to Lamar. 2nd year MVPs and whatnot. Hopefully Lamar's 3rd year as a starter goes as well as Mahomes :')"
2757,2020-08-18 23:47:38,iboxx2,"Yeah I agree with that analysis, the Ravens are very thrilled to grab the duo they did."
2758,2020-08-18 15:59:15,iboxx2,"The Ravens could finish with 10 wins and I would think that it was OK.  They must have had some bad bounces, an injury or maybe they struggled to replace Yanda.  I'd be a little disappointed, but not surprised.  

The Ravens could have 14 wins.  I'd figure that they didn't miss a beat from last year, and they did a good job avoiding a letdown and minimizing the winnable games that slip through their fingers.  I'd be pleased, but not surprised.  

Honestly, I think that what I think about the Ravens this year depends more on the playoffs than the regular season.  If they miss the playoffs or go one-and-done, then it'll be a disappointing season.  If they play in the Superbowl, then that will be an amazing success."
2759,2020-08-18 21:58:22,iboxx2,While you “want” we’ll be watching the Browns fail.
2760,2020-08-18 00:13:18,iboxx2,"Idk, imagining the face of a Cleveland-dweller every time they accidentally click on modellwithlombardi.jpg makes me all warm and fuzzy"
2761,2020-08-18 03:35:32,iboxx2,"Lol, I don't know what you said in your original comment, but you're definitely right here. I hope the Steelers, Browns, and Bengals fail miserably every week and I wouldn't expect anything less of other fans. I can still be civil while hoping their team goes 0-16."
2762,2020-08-18 00:19:16,iboxx2,"Bottom feeders such as the 49ers, Seahawks, Bills, Texans, Patriots, and Rams?"
2763,2020-08-18 00:20:58,iboxx2,"Tough schedule? 2020 is projected to be easier than the one we had last year. Not that I put much stock in preseason projections given that a lot can change, but your claim that we have a tough schedule ahead of us is blatantly false."
2764,2020-08-18 05:11:55,iboxx2,"What the hell are you talking about? We had one of the toughest strengths of schedule of any team last year and still only had two losses.

Playoff teams: Patriots, Chiefs, Seahawks, 49ers, Texans, Bills. We went 5-1 

Rams and Steelers both narrowly missed the postseason too and we went 3-0 against them.

We have the easiest strength of schedule this upcoming year since we play the NFC East and AFC South.

Thanks for letting us know that you have no idea what you're talking about though, dumbass."
2765,2020-08-18 15:11:39,iboxx2,You mean the patriots team that was being compared to the best defense of all time?
2766,2020-08-18 01:09:50,iboxx2,I’m glad you got your notifications numbers up since clearly that’s all you did this for
2767,2020-08-18 09:51:57,iboxx2,"> The Browns are the only team in the league that have proven they can slow down Lamar more than once.
> 
> 

<_<"
2768,2020-08-18 03:22:05,iboxx2,At least it won’t be to their benefit like the last two years. Arrowhead is notoriously tough to play in so a neutral field should help a lot.
2769,2020-08-18 19:47:48,iboxx2,Hopefully the goodwill continues as the rivalry grows. But if the twitter trolls I've seen from both of our fan bases already is any indication...lol
2770,2020-08-18 16:10:10,iboxx2,"Wholeheartedly agree with everything you've said here. This year feels like 13-3 with a decent playoff run. A few things need to come together. 

This franchise spoils us."
2771,2020-08-18 23:21:55,iboxx2,We will see
2772,2020-08-18 00:17:29,iboxx2,It only gets funnier every year because the browns keep getting worse every year.
2773,2020-08-18 03:50:15,iboxx2,Oh I was civil. I said sarcastically I was shocked seeing a pro ravens breakdown written by a raven fan. And of course raven fans got their panties in a bunch. And I like how people downvoted my last reply acting like they don’t hate on other teams in their division. At least you are keeping it real.
2774,2020-08-18 01:12:53,iboxx2,"Lol the guy can’t even respond to this one. We played and beat the best of the best all season long (besides the chiefs).  The 3,4, and 5 seeds in the afc. The 1 seed and the other team that was 1 game away from the 1 seed in the nfc."
2775,2020-08-18 00:23:42,iboxx2,"Because I’m not basing that opinion on last year, I’m looking at how teams have changed for better or for worse. Your schedule is brutal."
2776,2020-08-18 15:35:07,iboxx2,"Technically correct, you don't slow us down so much as you outpace us."
2777,2020-08-18 19:51:17,iboxx2,"Ha, if I judged any fanbase off of twitter, I'd hate damn near everyone.

/u/everymanawildcat made a pretty funny gif over on our sub about how different the disparity really is. Can't wait for more Ravens/Chiefs gif wars for the years to come."
2778,2020-08-18 04:08:52,iboxx2,"Oh, I didn't mean to imply I didn't think you were civil, I just meant that as long as people keep it civil it's no big deal.

Haha, but yeah, everyone hates their rivals. That's the goal of divisions in the first place, to build a rivalry. I'm not sure why anyone would claim otherwise."
2779,2020-08-18 05:12:44,iboxx2,The schedule against the shitty NFC East and the AFC South? So brutal.
2780,2020-08-18 01:10:30,iboxx2,Unlike the one they  had last year? Didn’t we they also get better too?
2781,2020-08-18 04:15:22,iboxx2,Yeah it’s something weird about society today. Like it’s wrong to hate others. Everyone has to be nice and hold hands and shit. I don’t know. And watch like my last post I will be downvoted again. Probably another raven fan. Haha who cares. See you game one. I hope we are ready.
2782,2020-08-18 02:32:06,ibmv0z,"fuck this is a big month 

they are airing *Fire Walk With Me*!!! thats crazy"
2783,2020-08-18 02:39:21,ibmv0z,"Interestingly eclectic range of films that TCM will being showing for the first time- as always, a pity that I am not a subscriber......"
2784,2020-08-18 15:23:26,ibmv0z,"Well, it's scheduled, anyway (under the cover of their cult/avant-garde/out-of-their-programming-normality umbrella ""TCM Underground."") Whether or not it actually makes it to air is another kettle of fish entirely.

In the 14 years ""Underground"" has been airing on the channel, around 7 movies have been scheduled and then replaced at airtime."
2785,2020-08-18 15:44:22,ibmv0z,damn what are those seven? because they have aired like A Clockwork Orange and Female Trouble and other weird graphic stuff so I am not doubting they will its just crazy
2786,2020-08-18 17:03:17,ibmv0z,"(looking at my notes)

The first scheduled airing of ""The Candy Snatchers"" was replaced by ""Heavenly Bodies"" (I think it was a rights issue.) Later that season, ""The Candy Snatchers"" was scheduled again and that time it ran. Which I was grateful for as it had been one of my long time ""wanna-sees"".


""Nothing Lasts Forever"" (another of my long-time ""wanna-sees"") ran on its first scheduled showing in 2015 but its second scheduled showing in May of 2015 was replaced by a showing of ""Brainstorm"". (This time I know it was a rights issue.)

""The Wonder World of K. Gordon Murray"" was scheduled and was replaced by ""The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T"" in December, 2010.

In 2009, ""Massacre At Central High"" (another of my wanna-sees) was replaced at zero hour with ""All Night Long (1962)"" (that one I'm still smarting over.)


""Zombiethon"" (a clip show of the goriest parts of various zombie movies) was scheduled but replaced by the much-less-graphic ""Zombies of Mora Tau."" (Word around the campfire is that Standards and Practices put the kai-bosh to that plan.)


Even this season now-ending had a replacement. ""The New Centurians"" was pre-empted by a showing of ""The Yakuza.""


Okay, so six not seven. My bad."

That said a tank wouldnt be best for the team, so its not what I want. I don't think Hinkie will accept the job unless Hinkie has full control plus some more."
2789,2020-08-17 17:37:33,ibhvq9,I would love Sam Hinkie. He is the complete opposite of Vlade in that he is a CBA expert and figures out ways to take advantage of it. This was shown by him finding some diamonds in the rough like Robert Covington and then locking them up with multi year minimum deals with team options in it.
2790,2020-08-17 22:49:45,ibhvq9,Hinkie is brilliant and we would be incredibly lucky to land him.
2791,2020-08-17 17:20:27,ibhvq9,Yea I dont care about the letter. I care if he tries to do rhe Philly 2.0 shit. Don't tell us your actively tanking amf you're going to put out a g league roster. That ruined a lot of fan experiences and was a hindrance to the league
2792,2020-08-17 17:16:01,ibhvq9,"Meh. Hinkie didn't do that much besides fleece bad GMs, acquire a fuckton of second rounders, and drafted fairly poorly with lottery picks.

Honestly he quit at the perfect time. He will always get the credit for whatever the 76ers accomplish yet zero blame if they don't accomplish anything. He got to do the easy part of tearing the roster down and putting out a shitty team. He was decent at trading though. He never had to do the hard part of taking those pieces and making them into something competitive on an elite level

I wouldn't be upset about it, but I am not going to get hyped because they got someone else to watch over 4 or so years of shameless tanking for the outside chance that they have a handful of decent players to show for it.

And frankly a big part of why he got pushed out was because of the minority owners of the 76ers tired of losing so much money. Remember when you could buy a row of seats for like $20? And that's in one of the largest basketball markets in America. There is no way the Sacramento Kings ownership group would be down for that."
2793,2020-08-17 17:58:50,ibhvq9,"It’s interesting to me that people want Hinkie- I think what they are saying is that they want to go through “The Process” here?

That means trading Fox, Buddy, Holmes- literally anyone that will make us accidentally win a game.  

We trade everyone that has any kind of value for YEARS AND YEARS including jettisoning draft picks that don’t seem like they will become super stars.

Oh Giles puts together a few good games, he has some trade value?! GONE FOR A COUPLE 2nd rounders!  Draft a solid 3 and d player? Trade him for more assets.

Some folk need to go back and look at what it was like to be Philly fan for the last decade- and guess what?  STILL NO RINGS"
2794,2020-08-17 19:33:01,ibhvq9,"I am sold, let’s do it!"
2795,2020-08-17 21:11:31,ibhvq9,I wouldn't mind Hinkie but nowadays you need a full staff of GM quality people in your front office to be successful. I would just hope Hinkie would surround himself with assistant GMs that have a better eye for talent than him and guys that have good reputations with agents and players.
2796,2020-08-17 21:50:27,ibhvq9,Yeah the tanking for picks worked out great for them
2797,2020-08-18 03:44:52,ibhvq9,"nah, thats gonna be a no for me dog..."
2798,2020-08-18 05:54:14,ibhvq9,Who else besides RoCo? He was the only one far as I can recall.
2799,2020-08-17 17:27:58,ibhvq9,"Just curious, but was the last 14 years of Kings basketball not a hindrance to the league? Hinkie had a clear plan and executed on it. It’s not like there aren’t bad teams year after year as is. I’m not saying he didn’t make mistakes but he acquired an impressive amount of assets in the short term as GM for the team. 

We also don’t know that he would take the same approach now since the lottery odds have changed."
2800,2020-08-17 23:00:15,ibhvq9,"Man I’m so tired of reading takes like this. It’s like you haven’t even stopped to consider WHY he did that at all. 

You guys don’t understand Philly was screwed when Hinkie took over. They were a middle-of-the-road team in the East. They had Jrue Holiday as an All Star in the last year of his rookie contract, and he was about to command a huge contract. They were pretty much tapped out as far as salary cap was concerned, and they had made some trades under the previous GM that had unloaded their draft assets. They were stuck in a rut. They didn’t have the opportunity to buy their way out of it, and they didn’t have many trade chips they could cash in.

Hinkie developed a strategy to strip everything down, exchange their overloaded salary cap for picks and prospects, stash on draft capital and start over. He made a choice to trade Holiday, which may or may not have been the right choice, but that’s because they didn’t have many options available. 

You people forget that Hinkie worked with Daryl Morey in Houston before he went to Philly. It’s not like the only strategy he knows is to completely tank and start over. You have to make due with what you have. 

Let me ask you a different question: how is what he did in Philly worse than what we’ve done here? The Kings had a bottom-8 record in the NBA every year from 2008-09 through 2017-18, including multiple bottom 5s and one year when we had the worst record in the NBA. And we were supposedly trying to compete!!!

Philly won a playoff series in 2012, missed the playoffs but competed in 2012-13, then had a 4-year run where they were terrible. But then what happened? They won 52 games in 2017-18 and have been an East contender ever since. 

So explain to me what’s so much worse about what Hinkie did compared to what we have been doing, because apparently I’m not smart enough to understand how gaming the draft system to obtain assets in a 4 year stretch where you have no chance of competing is somehow worse than flinging poo at the wall for 14 years and being terrible accidentally."
2801,2020-08-17 20:43:32,ibhvq9,"I actually loved watching that “g-league talent” - guys like Robert Covington, Richaun Holmes, Jerami Grant, Christian Wood - during those “bad” process years. Give me 5 Tony Wroten floor slapping highlights over 10 Jimmer plays! :)"
2802,2020-08-17 18:03:11,ibhvq9,"I'd argue that fleecing bad GMs and acquiring draft picks was the best course of action for the 76ers at the time.  Tearing down the roster and putting out a shitty team is a tough thing to do, knowing that you're going to get dragged through the mud by fans and possibly pushed out by ownership.  But, because of that bold strategy the 76ers are one of the better teams in the league right now.  Also, his drafting was respectable IMO:

2013: Selected Noel 6th (using NO's pick) - next good pick was CJ McCollum at #10.  Also selected future ROY Michael Carter Williams

2014: Joel Embiid 3rd, also picked Jerami Grant in the 2nd round.

2015: Okafor 3rd (his worst pick), but picked Richaun Holmes in the 2nd round.

2016: Was no longer the GM, but they got Ben Simmons with the 1st overall pick because of Hinkie.

In any case, my point is that Hinkie's a smart dude with GM experience, and tearing down the Kings the same way he did for the 76ers wouldn't likely be his strategy (we have better assets now than the 76ers did in 2013, and updated draft lottery rules too - so all-out tanking doesn't make sense for us they way it did for them)."
2803,2020-08-17 18:28:29,ibhvq9,"I'm not saying that I want the Kings to go through ""the process"".  I'm saying that ""the process"" was the best path forward for the 76ers at the time, and Hinkie recognized that.  I believe that Hinkie has the aptitude to recognize the best path forward for the Kings at this moment, and that he's more than a one-trick pony (ie, he wouldn't engage the Kings in a multi-year tank scenario, because that's not all he knows how to do).

as for ""STILL NO RINGS"", I don't believe that should be your only metric for success.  There are a lot of properly run teams that haven't gotten any rings over the past decade, which are a lot of fun to root for because they're managed to be successful."
2804,2020-08-17 18:43:34,ibhvq9,"What has it been like to be a Kings fan? Zero **playoff appearances** in over a decade! Mostly because we've wasted time clinging to mediocre talents and mediocre teams. 

I support something like the process because I'm tired of the cycle of mediocrity. I'm tired of overpaying stopgap veterans and 3rd and 4th options. I'm tired of pretending to get excited about Harry Giles. I'm tired of celebrating mediocrity and pretending that it's going to magically become elite.

If you look at teams that compete for a title, nearly all of them got there through

1. Major FA acquisitions 

2. Top draft picks

We will never be an attractive FA destination. We weren't, even in the early 2000s, when we were ""The Greatest Show on Court."" So we need top draft picks. And tanking is the most effective way to do it."
2805,2020-08-17 19:19:05,ibhvq9,"76ers were the second best team of 2019. One point away from defeating the Raptors in a game 7 because Kawhi took a buzzer beater shot. Had that not happened, they would have dethrone the Bucks easily. They also are very successful now compared to many mediocre seasons like most of their existence. I take that over the same bullshit seasons since 2007 anyday of the week. 

This team deserves to get fucking destroyed and taste more defeat like the pathetic fuckers they are until they draft right. If trying to win got them no where, why keep trying? Your mindset is total insanity.

Fox will never win a ring. Hield will never win a ring. No one on this roster has it in them to be a champion, let alone lead. The 39 win season was simply a fluke. 9th seed and what did they get out of it? Nothing. No 1st round pick either. Even their best season post 2006 had a depressing ending. This team needs to fucking suffer. The fans suffered enough. I do not care if they tank and go 0-82. They need a hall of fame caliber player at number 1 and finish what wasn't done in 2002."
2806,2020-08-17 23:44:46,ibhvq9,Sounds good to me.

Of which only 1 (Embiid) panned out. 

His plan was a glorified version of throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks until you get a franchise player. He just maximized the amount of shit he had. 

He gets lauded so highly but at the end of the day he whiffed multiple times. 

Is he a solid GM? Sure. I’ll commend him for cutting his losses like with MCW and selling high on him. And he knew how to take advantage of dumb GMs like our very own. 

But the best thing he did was create “the process” and use that branding to justify several underwhelming picks."
2811,2020-08-17 17:40:26,ibhvq9,"It's not a hindrance the way the 76ers were. 76ers bring value to the NBA as a major market. Sacramento takes as a minor market. (They don't even add that much to the TV market with the Warriors also in the area) The 76ers being bad for so long lost local money and national money. The Kings being bad or good does little to affect national revenue.

\> It’s not like there aren’t bad teams year after year as is

There is a big difference between accidentally bad and purposefully bad. Those 76ers teams were fucking awful on purpose. It just goes against the competitive nature of sports and violates the general trust of fans."
2812,2020-08-17 17:59:54,ibhvq9,Not in the way the Sixers were doing it. Hinkie told his owners what he was doing. Other owners were completely pissed because they were now losing money and  Hinkie did not want to field a NBA level team. You are not only showing you have zero integrity to be competitive but you are getting on the shit list of other owners. Did you know Vivek waived his revenue sharing rights in order to keep the team in Sacramento? I dont think that philosophy will mesh with Vivek.
2813,2020-08-17 23:47:01,ibhvq9,"First and foremost, no team is ever so bad financially or stuck in purgatory roster that they need to intentionally tank. That was his quick way out of the mess, while other teams have shown it is very possible to get out of that mess with openly tanking.

Lol how can you say we don't know where he came from? Its not a secret or user locked to you and not others lol Hinkie may have changed, its entirely possibly. How the fuck ever, we can say the opposite thing about DUMARS ""This is the guy who drafted Darko"", plenty of reddiotrs on our sub have said that and its not hard to find.  Hinkie will only hurt our culture. We fucking suck. But we aren't fucking toxic. Having a bunch of g leaguers who aren't NBA ready mixed in with players actually wanting to win is a bad mix.  You think Philly was all happy during that time?

Kings didn't lose their integrity when trying to become a better team. Its a pretty big no brainer on why Silver stepped in to have Hinkie step down and why the Kings were backed up by the league to remain where they are located."

2816,2020-08-17 18:20:23,ibhvq9,">we have better assets now than the 76ers did in 2013.

No, the Kings really don't.

The 76ers also had a poorly constructed roster with a promising 22 year old Allstar pointguard in Jrue Holiday due his first payday. Hinkie's first move was dumping him to draft Nerlens Noel, who had recently torn his ACL, and a first round pick (10th overall in 2014, and he took Elfrid Payton and then used him to trade down for Saric, who was staying overseas, and a future protected first that I don't think they ever got). None of the assets related to trading away a 22 Allstar pointguard panned out, except maybe Saric who isn't on the team anymore

Fox is a borderline Allstar PG due his first payday. He is fucking gone the day Hinkie arrives"
2817,2020-08-17 19:50:43,ibhvq9,"Morey himself has said this, publicly - that Hinkie is open to every avenue, and that strategy changes per team. They were very in sync on this.

If people read the letter, like you suggest, they would realize how reflective and introspective he is.

People love to exaggerate and turn it into a decade long tankathon. It was not. He inherited a team in Spring of 2013 with Jrue Holiday, Evan Turner, Spencer Hawes, and Thad Young. No other value. Missing future firsts. By Spring of 2017, a year after he was pushed out, he had turned that into Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Robert Covington, an upcoming overall 3rd in that draft partially thanks to Vlade, and a fuck ton of cap space. No, they have not yet won a ring, and frankly, probably never will - too many botched moves in the 4 years since his departure now.  But they turned it around relatively quickly, into something that at least looks much more promising while still winning games."

Also, I didn’t say that “Rings are the only measure of success.”  Hinkie put those fans through those years of suffering TO WIN RINGS.  He’s not shy about this fact. Why would you not want to see his success or failure measured by his own stated goals, and his ability to achieve them? 

He has a modern approach and a clear philosophy- those things are super appealing to most of us, after years of not having either.  

Imagining Hinkie at the helm so that he could be a regular GM and make sound moves, building a team smartly over time, is NOT what most people seem to want him for."
2819,2020-08-17 18:46:27,ibhvq9,"So this is my point- people want “The Process” more than Sam Hinkie.  Hell, you or I could probably manage to trade every player that seemed even remotely good for future picks for a few years- painful!"
2820,2020-08-17 19:22:14,ibhvq9,"Well you have some anger, I can’t really blame you- hang in there, brother.  Or don’t! 29 other teams, all of which have made the playoffs more recently than we have."
2821,2020-08-17 23:43:36,ibhvq9,"Honest question-!What other rebuilding process do you associate with Hinkie? More importantly, where you see the upvotes, what strategy do you think people imagine Hinkie would take?

And you can read the history of Hinkie as a GM during “the process” , where he traded away anyone with value for years to stockpile assets and maximize draft positioning. 

I remember it because I followed the NBA very closely in those years, and was fascinated every time he would shamelessly dump players for more picks- exactly what you are now trying to convince me didn’t happen.

Do you think the Kings 1. Have enough to satisfy the “50+ win” benchmark in the near future? 

Apologies if you need me to speak to you with more condescension and insults, I do not know why you are so abrasive.  It is possible for two fans of the same team to have a discussion about the team without acting like dicks."

2823,2020-08-17 23:03:44,ibhvq9,"Ok, not counting Simmons is one of those situations that is technically correct, but also complete bullshit. Simmons was the consensus #1 (some people liked Ingram, so win/win) and they got that pick by executing Hinkie’s strategy. Then they executed Hinkie before he got a chance to make the actual pick. 

Just because the draft took a place a couple weeks after they forced him out doesn’t mean it wasn’t his pick."

It's not just about what they received in trade value though (and #6 and #10 in consecutive drafts is nothing to sneeze at).  Without Jrue heroballing them to 35 wins, they won just 19 games and were able to draft Joel Embiid the very next year after trading him."
2827,2020-08-17 23:21:32,ibhvq9,"You’re out of your mind if you don’t think we’re in a better position than the Sixers were in 2013. Do you guys even look anything up before saying this stuff? 

The season before Hinkie took over, Philly made a huge trade for Andrew Bynum and Jason Richardson where they essentially gave up:

Nikola Vucevic, Mo Harkless, 2014 1st, 2018 1st, and Andre Iguodala.

That left them with $17 Million owed to Andrew Bynum (who was obviously a complete disaster in Philly), plus $16 Million to Elton Brand (dust at the time), $8.5 Million to Spencer Hawes, $8.3m Thad Young, $6m to Richardson (also dust, end of career), $11m between Evan Turner and Nick Young. And they were just bad enough to get the 11th pick in the Draft that year. 

Does that sound like a team loaded with assets to you???

The Kings have Fox, Bagley, Buddy, Barnes on tradeable multi-year contracts (maybe not in Barnes’ case). They have 1 year left on Bjelica, Holmes, and Parker (first 2 absolutely valuable).  Bogdan is expiring RFA. Bazemore is an expiring deal. Len is expiring. 

We don’t have any major dead weight other than Barnes (debatable) and Cory Joseph. Our 3 best players are either RFA or have multiple years left. And we have all of our picks!!! No more swaps even!

Kings are in an infinitely better position on paper than the Sixers were when Hinkie took over and it’s not even remotely close. We just haven’t had somebody in charge with a brain big enough to do anything with it."
2828,2020-08-17 18:58:55,ibhvq9,"All fair points.  The evidence I see that he'd be a good GM is based on:

- His history working under Morey in Houston.
- Hinkie's background in approaching talent acquisition using analytics (both FAs and draft picks)
- Looking at the relative success that the 76ers have enjoyed over the past few seasons - yes, it was painful under Hinkie's reign, but it produced results.
- Looking at his resume, and reading his exit letter (as an example of intelligence) to understand why he made the choices that he made.

Regarding your last point:
>Imagining Hinkie at the helm so that he could be a regular GM and make sound moves, building a team smartly over time, is NOT what most people seem to want him for.

The reason I made this post was to discuss his merits aside from his ability to lead a tanking team (given the comments and discussion, I don't think I succeeded TBH).  I do believe he'd build a team smartly over time, given his aptitude, and it wouldn't necesitate a multi-year tank."

Guranteed they draft consecutive busts in 2021 and 2022 because Joe Dumbass is in charge. Don't be fooled. That championship was in part mostly to coaching. Dumars ran Pistons to the ground and put them in a position where their best player, Andre Drummond, was traded for 2 2nd rounders and a fucked up Brandon Knight. Nevermind the numerous bad selections he made and the atrocious trades. The fuck do you think he will do to the Kings?

The information is readily available, I even gave detailed breakdowns here in this thread! But you still insist on taking an extremely narrow-minded version of what you think happened and applying it as if it’s some undeniable truth, which is ridiculous.

2832,2020-08-17 18:07:41,ibhvq9,"Not technically.  Hinkie had been outed before the 2016 draft, so Coangelo technically gets the credit for drafting Simmons.

You know he would strip this team and make it his own. This is not getting a job with Houston, Golden State, Boston, or (ironically) Philly. The Kings have a multi year problem that needs fixing. They have whiffed on too many drafts in recent years to do anything but start over from scratch."

2842,2020-08-17 18:10:39,ibhvq9,"There is no “technically” about it. He didn’t draft him in any way. 

Yes the 76ers took him, but there is no guarantee Hinkie would have taken Ben. Would he have? Probably, he was pretty much the consensus #1. But he may have  liked Ingram’s potential more. We don’t know what he would have done. 

I don’t think it’s fair to include Ben Simmons when discussing Sam Hinkie’s tenure and draft history."

2844,2020-08-18 00:37:17,ibhvq9,"If his options were Simmons or Ingram then he couldn’t have gone wrong either way, they’re both good the point was getting that pick in the first place. The strategy worked."
2845,2020-08-18 00:36:11,ibhvq9,"Hang on, I never said the Kings have a core and assets to build a contender in the West. I said we have a lot of tradeable pieces, and we don’t owe any future picks, which means he would have flexibility here that he did not have in Philly in 2013. There’s a big difference. 

Even if we smash the next couple drafts and make some shrewd trades we’re still years away from actually being able to compete without a LOT of luck. 

Just so we’re on the same page, passing on Luka fucked is out of any opportunity to actually compete for a title for at least the next 5 years, barring an incredible stroke of luck in our favor."
2846,2020-08-17 18:25:44,ibhvq9,"He said he would have taken Ingram in a 2017 interview

Simmons is the better player, but Ingram is the better fit. Of course Simmons could have immediately been traded for a warchest if they thought the fit wasn't going to work out. It took a little while longer for Ingram to come into his own."
2847,2020-08-17 18:20:48,ibhvq9,"Whether he would have taken Simmons or Ingram is inconsequential... it's not like either of the guys are Anthony Bennet.

The takeaway is that Hinkie's strategy lead the 76ers to a #1 pick that turned into a player that's deserving of a max contract."
2848,2020-08-18 00:41:26,ibhvq9,"So he would be tearing it all down and tanking...

Or you think he would build around Fox and somehow make a competitive team in several years?

The guy has been pretty clear that it’s championship or bust. If he was given a decent team, he might be able to get them over the edge. The Kings though? Arguing that the Kings are in a better position than Philly was is pointless when the outcome is still The Process"
2849,2020-08-17 18:25:48,ibhvq9,"If we get the #1 pick in 2021 and draft Cade Cunningham next year does Vlade get credit for that?

Or does he not because we’ve been accidentally bad and not intentionally bad with a catchphrase."
2850,2020-08-18 00:51:16,ibhvq9,"Dude, you don’t get it. I feel like I need to make a podcast about this so I can explain it in a way that everybody understands. 

The Process is not a blanket way of building teams that’s applicable in every scenario. The Process was necessary for his specific situation because the situation the Sixers were in back in summer 2013 was so desperate, he had no other choice. 

And again, the Kings have enough flexibility and tradeable assets that going full Process would not be necessary here. 

You guys gotta get this Process shit out of your heads. He’s not a vampire ffs."
2851,2020-08-17 23:04:40,ibhvq9,That’s not the same thing. That would be a full year after Vlade stepped down. You know that’s not an honest argument.
2852,2020-08-17 18:49:44,ibhvq9,"In that situation, I suppose Vlade would get credit.

I suppose the difference is having a winning outcome based on strategy and planning vs. having a winning outcome because you fell face foward into a pile of shit and there happened to be a gold nugget in it."
2853,2020-08-18 13:53:01,ibhvq9,"I simply disagree with you, no need to be a dick about it."
2854,2020-08-17 19:11:53,ibhvq9,"And that’s fine. 

I just don’t think we should be hailing Sam Hinkie as some genius because he intentionally fell into the pile of shit versus accidentally. 

His intentional strategy produced almost as many bad or underwhelming picks as Vlade had and he only chose 1 good one, just like Vlade did (Fox). But Vlade obviously had the biggest fuck up with 2018. 

Make no mistake, I do think Hinkie would be a perfectly fine hire. But the way he’s heralded by many fans across the league blows my mind."

2879,2020-08-17 16:23:23,ib79da,"Robby Gordon's team can be traced back to a team owned by Bill Terry in 1982. That team, which ran the #32 and later #35. It was then bought by Alan Kulwicki after he made 14 starts for the team in 1986, when Alan was a rookie. Alan changed the number to 7 in 1987 (to mimic the Z logo of new sponsor Zerex).

After Alan's death, the team was effectively run by SABCO Racing until Geoff Bodine bought the team and drove the #7 until 1999, when he sold it to Jim Mattei and John Porter, who put Michael Waltrip in the car. These new owners were then bought out by Jim Smith the following year, and he fielded cars for Waltrip, Mike Wallace, Robby Gordon, and Kevin Lepage.

In 2002, the team partnered with Evernham to field a car for Casey Atwood. The partnership ended after that season and the car went to Jimmy Spencer for a season and change before the team folded in early 2004. Robby Gordon bought the assets of the team, brought on Smith as a co-owner, and ran RGM until 2012."

2904,2020-08-17 13:56:34,ib62lj,"While I I completely agree JD should be working the phones to see what's available and at what price, Landry specifically is likely a no-go due to his public beef with Gase from his days in Miami"

2906,2020-08-17 07:40:14,ib62lj,"We did the same exact thing last year...because lets be honest, Robby Anderson definitely wasn't a number 1"
2907,2020-08-17 12:45:54,ib62lj,"You do realize we can't just go out and sign every player we want, right? Like, some of them are under contracts with different teams. Some of them want too much money.

There isn't just a surplus of all star receivers available AND we made good improvements to our offensive line. This isn't going to be fixed in 1 season."
2908,2020-08-17 13:59:43,ib62lj,I was thinking of teams . Not wanting Odell I said Landry shouldve realized that.
2909,2020-08-17 03:18:19,ib62lj,I like him in alot but if u think we r good at reciever bcuz of Hogan pick up . I'm sorry but that's not gonna do it
2910,2020-08-17 13:02:38,ib62lj,We havent had a good reciever since Brandon Marshall was gifted to us at end of his career and he still was better than anyone weve had as of recent.
2911,2020-08-17 03:20:35,ib62lj,Just gotta hope the Mims injury is minor and he develops well. Hopefully Vincynt is okay too but his sounded a little more serious
2912,2020-08-17 13:03:19,ib62lj,"Okay, who would you like the Jets to sign right now to make this better?"
2913,2020-08-17 03:31:40,ib62lj,I'm sorry but depending on a rookie to literally be a difference maker is a terrible formula for a wr corps in the NFL.  The greatest teams have duos that pass the torch and it begins w a number 1 that is undoubtably #1 talent in the league .
2914,2020-08-17 17:54:41,ib62lj,"The real problem was taking only 1 WR in a deeeeep class when your WR group was already questionable. Now, you can't really do anything but hope someone good gets squeezed out at the end of camp. You can also sign DT for depth because BP has injury concerns and Vyncent Smith is in no way a WR1 or WR2."
2915,2020-08-17 17:56:59,ib62lj,"My point is we can't fix it all over night. If we took 3 WRs in the draft we would be having this exact same conversation about offensive linemen.

The Ashtyn Davis pick was questionable at the time and I think we can all agree we're glad it happened now that Adams is gone."
2916,2020-08-17 18:09:13,ib62lj,"I don't think the Davis pick was questionable at the time because I'm sure they were looking to buy insurance with how Jamal was acting & Maye does have an injury history even though he stayed healthy last season. The Morgan pick was questionable. You didn't need to take 3 WRs, but to not take a second one was questionable. 

They got their OL pick in the first and they took another one in the fourth to add to a few FA acquisitions. You can't give Darnold nobody to throw to. You just can't. Obviously you can't fix it all in 1 off season because the team still has its' needs, but the class was deep and you only took 1 and now the group looks like shit. We've seen this shit over and over again. An improved OL cool & all but if Darnold but Darnold still needs weapons."
2917,2020-08-17 18:27:52,ib62lj,"At first I was skeptical of the Morgan pick but looking back, we lost Darnold for 4 games last year and had complete incompetency at QB. If we had won 2 of those games we would have been in contention for a playoff spot. Having a decent back up is important and we don't know about flaccos neck."
2918,2020-08-17 18:33:15,ib62lj,"Absolutely. The Jets need a competent backup QB because Darnold has yet to play a full season. Whether people say they're fluke reasons or not, it doesn't change that fact. However, there's a lot of question marks with not only taking Morgan, but taking him at that spot. All in all, not double dipping at WR was and still is questionable. Darnold can have all the time in the world, but it won't matter if he has trash receivers who can't get open. He can't throw to Crowder 30x a game. We have to hope Cager or someone else can turn into something."
2919,2020-08-17 18:38:02,ib62lj,"I think Darnold can do more with a good offensive line and sub par receivers than the opposite. It doesn't matter if we get him Julio Jones if he's on his back the entire game.

With that being said I hope we still look to upgrade at WR whenever possible, I'm just saying we can't have it all immediately"

2952,2020-08-16 15:25:48,iat3oa,"I dont think this recieving corps is as bad as everyone thinks.

perriman has actually looked good lately. Last year when Evans and Godwim went down, Perriman was able to step into the #1 spot and look like a legitimate starting x-reciever. Crowder is a great slot reciever, Hogan is.... fine for a 3rd string wr. Sims probably won't make an impact this year  because injuries and lack of reps, but he's got plenty of potential."
2953,2020-08-16 16:51:08,iat3oa,Now if that isn’t the most stacked wide receiver room I’ve ever seen. Whooo boy I see why Tom Brady got the fuck out of that division

2964,2020-08-17 01:13:29,iat3oa,At what point do you just say ya I’m done playing for the jets and ask for a trade?
2965,2020-08-17 01:47:22,iat3oa,NFLs own bad batch !
2966,2020-08-17 02:33:53,iat3oa,"So whenever or however y'all feel the need to make a mock draft for the Jets I'd suggest making our needs as follows

WR, EDGE, CB

In that exact order."
2967,2020-08-17 03:05:54,iat3oa,Yikes
2968,2020-08-17 04:23:12,iat3oa,"Jamison Crowder is a legit WR. He put in work when he was in Washington. He wasn't prolific, but he wasn't trash either. 

I'll never forget this: 2018, Week 15 @ Jacksonville, 3rd and 15, losing 6-13 in the 4th quarter. The announcer says ""Third and long has been killer today for the Redskins"". Josh Johnson throws to Crowder. Crowder tips the ball to beat the safety and then catches it to keep the eventual touchdown drive going. 

Give Crowder some respect."
2969,2020-08-17 04:25:21,iat3oa,I’m sensing the Niners may trade a WR closer to camp ending.
2970,2020-08-17 04:25:22,iat3oa,Another excuse instead of just admitting that hes bit that good of a quarterback. Ya its not a great group but other quarterbacks have had the same or worse and looked competant or better. Hes just not that good.
2971,2020-08-17 10:36:54,iat3oa,Why no love for Braxton Berrios? That's you wr1 sorted.
2972,2020-08-17 11:49:32,iat3oa,all i see on the r/nfl is jets content
2973,2020-08-16 14:20:53,iat3oa,Solid group.
2974,2020-08-16 16:48:41,iat3oa,You forgot the ghosts
2975,2020-08-16 16:06:36,iat3oa,Stealing Yates thunder this morning
2976,2020-08-16 19:20:06,iat3oa,Darnold has a squad of failed fantasy sleepers lol
2977,2020-08-16 17:52:50,iat3oa,Who?
2978,2020-08-16 17:50:29,iat3oa,"He's still got to perform. It's certainly not ideal but this is turning into the Josh Rosen situation where everyone is making excuses for a player they'll eventually come to realize isn't that good anyway. If he doesn't show significant signs of improvement this season and they have a high pick, it's time to move on. It's year 3 now."
2979,2020-08-16 16:20:32,iat3oa,It was our lone offense touchdown during the Luke Falk era
2980,2020-08-16 23:43:35,iat3oa,My buddy who's normally a good drafter took him and I just shouted what the fuck from across the room
2981,2020-08-17 02:04:25,iat3oa,"As someone disappointed I didn't get him at the draft, yes."
2982,2020-08-17 00:55:21,iat3oa,I took him as my WR 2. He did fuck all.
2983,2020-08-16 14:23:37,iat3oa,Yeah this is just like when we used to hype up nobodies as Cam’s “weapons”
2984,2020-08-16 16:08:49,iat3oa,What do you expect when you have inept GMs who prefer to make splashy FA signings rather than draft well? JD is turning the ship around.
2985,2020-08-16 15:17:55,iat3oa,I feel so bad for the kid.  Wish he had a better situation to grow in because i think he has the talent to be really good
2986,2020-08-16 14:37:16,iat3oa,"Do we think Adam Gase would be better, worse, or the same wearing an actual ass for a hat on gamedays?  Does the ass type matter?"
2987,2020-08-16 14:42:40,iat3oa,Pretty good party guy though
2988,2020-08-16 14:29:43,iat3oa,"It still might be a better group than the Pats. A lot is riding on N'Keal Harry taking the 2nd year leap, Sanu who just came off the PUP looking like the 1 good game he had before injury, Edelman again trying to carry the entire offense on his back. When guys like Jakobi Meyers and Gunner Olszewski have realistic paths to make the roster you know the WR situation is grim."
2989,2020-08-16 16:45:07,iat3oa,I’m pretty sure we have that locked up.
2990,2020-08-17 11:44:28,iat3oa,Mims could be really good.
2991,2020-08-16 17:17:36,iat3oa,"Agreed, this is such a weak group with the only real upside being Mims. It feels like Gase is trying to say Darnolds trash if he doesn’t succeed with them and the only way to win is for Gase to get full roster control with a new QB."
2992,2020-08-16 23:01:11,iat3oa,"Wait a pats fan saying something about owners being accused of misconduct?? 
Also don't get me wrong, I'm not defending Johnson in any way shape or form, but pats fans shouldn't talk."
2993,2020-08-17 02:58:31,iat3oa,"With how Jets fans have behaved towards Jamal, they deserve this shit."
2994,2020-08-16 14:35:22,iat3oa,"The patriot receivers are arguably worse, your coach is a known cheater and your owner received a slap on the wrist for regularly going to rub and tugs down in Florida perpetuating prostitution and human trafficking so maybe don’t throw rocks in glass houses."
2995,2020-08-16 19:04:28,iat3oa,Send Darnold to the Pats
2996,2020-08-16 17:15:18,iat3oa,Herndon and Wesco hype!
2997,2020-08-16 19:24:02,iat3oa,"It’s not like this is a significant downgrade from what we’ve had at WR either of the last two years.

It would also be totally unsurprising if this was our best group of WRs from the last three years.

Whenever people express shock at how bad the Jets roster is, I just assume they haven’t been watching football until this year."
2998,2020-08-16 14:21:33,iat3oa,Mims and Crowder might be OK at least. I was hoping we’d end up drafting him tbh.
2999,2020-08-17 09:06:08,iat3oa,flacco to perriman connection is back on the menu boys
3000,2020-08-16 16:48:19,iat3oa,"More aerodynamic, clearly"
3001,2020-08-16 15:55:20,iat3oa,We're fucked
3002,2020-08-16 17:49:50,iat3oa,"Yea, but what about the jets?"
3003,2020-08-16 15:23:10,iat3oa,"Well, I’ve got some bad news for you."
3004,2020-08-17 00:35:33,iat3oa,"Perriman definitely had a great year last year.  We'll see if it was a one-year thing, or if he'll turn back into a stone-hands pumpkin."
3005,2020-08-16 18:27:56,iat3oa,"Hogan used to be good as a deep threat 3-4 years ago, but that time is long past."
3006,2020-08-16 15:48:18,iat3oa,Hogan is ass my dude.
3007,2020-08-16 17:32:50,iat3oa,Is it the worst group in the NFL? Yes.
3008,2020-08-16 16:49:17,iat3oa,"Sure, but you’re talking about a speed receiver being productive in Bruce Arians’s down the field attack with Winston, one of the most aggressive down the field QBs, and going from that to Gase’s offense and Sam Darnold, who isn’t quite as good or as aggressive as Winston.

He still has issues catching the ball, and he still has issues creating for himself, but with TB last year he received the most amount of targets he’s had since his rookie year and received those targets further down the field all but a handful of WRs, and I think that’s where the uptick in his production came from"
3009,2020-08-16 16:21:21,iat3oa,On paper it's the worst in the league.  I'm not sure what to call that other than as bad as everyone thinks
3010,2020-08-16 19:12:04,iat3oa,"It doesn’t mean they can’t win, but what team do you think has worse weapons than the jets? The only team that I think might be close is the raiders but they have a very good tight end plus taking the first receiver in the draft this year"
3011,2020-08-16 16:08:14,iat3oa,It's pretty solidly a bottom ten receiver group in the league unless Mims gets his career off to a real fast start
3012,2020-08-16 18:19:45,iat3oa,"Last year was Robby Anderson, Quincy Enunwa (for 1 quarter) and a washed Demaryius Thomas. Kearse was the year before last."
3013,2020-08-16 14:22:05,iat3oa,You forgot the /s
3014,2020-08-16 18:33:52,iat3oa,"Player development is a thing, you know?  This isn't Madden, you don't just draft players and they eventually become however good or bad the game algorithms have randomly designed them to become.  Rosen was set up for failure in Arizona.  He might never *develop* into a good QB, but the excuses are legit.  And Darnold did show noticeable improvement last year despite also being set up for failure."
3015,2020-08-16 14:28:52,iat3oa,">Yeah this is just like when we used to hype up nobodies as Cam’s “weapons” 

Don't you disrespect Philly Brown

Edit oh shit I forgot about Brenton Bersin...


Edit: these motherfuckers don't even sound like real players"
3016,2020-08-16 15:33:15,iat3oa,"The great Ted Ginn, Corey Brown, Kevin Norwood, Keyarris Garrett, Damiere Byrd, and Stephen Hill."
3017,2020-08-16 18:18:47,iat3oa,Makes his MVP year more impressive. I wish he had focused more as a passer and was a more conservative runner.
3018,2020-08-16 18:02:01,iat3oa,Olsen was his WR1
3019,2020-08-16 20:19:40,iat3oa,Cus Steve Smith and Greg Olsen are bad weapons now.  Ted Ginn isn't too bad either.
3020,2020-08-16 16:23:37,iat3oa,"For Gase to adjust his playbook, game planning, play calling to the players he has to maximize their abilities?"
3021,2020-08-16 17:31:51,iat3oa,[deleted]
3022,2020-08-16 18:19:50,iat3oa,Or maybe a WAP Cap?
3023,2020-08-16 16:06:08,iat3oa,I would be really impressed if he managed to wear a donkey as a hat.
3024,2020-08-16 18:01:48,iat3oa,At least give the fans a good ass to look at..
3025,2020-08-16 18:27:19,iat3oa,Oh he's a great fuckin guy
3026,2020-08-16 14:32:25,iat3oa,"I think just having edelman makes ours better, guys a Super Bowl MVP and holds all types of playoff records,  but it’s not far off lol."
3027,2020-08-16 18:58:39,iat3oa,yo if Sanu is healthy he is a pretty fuckin solid 2/3 WR give the dude his due.
3028,2020-08-16 19:46:07,iat3oa,Nope. You guys at least have one above average receiver.
3029,2020-08-16 17:59:50,iat3oa,"Perriman has upside as well, he just also has 4 years on the books already where he didn't reach it."
3030,2020-08-16 18:20:47,iat3oa,What in the world is giving you that impression from Gase?
3031,2020-08-16 18:06:53,iat3oa,Darnolds gonna end up on the Pats and murder the jets for years isn't he
3032,2020-08-16 15:12:57,iat3oa,You gonna cry?
3033,2020-08-16 14:39:24,iat3oa,Y'all act as if kraft is the only owner to ever do shit.
3034,2020-08-16 17:54:14,iat3oa,Think he meant Griffin. Wesco is just another Maccagnan mistake that'll be cut soon.
3035,2020-08-16 17:51:12,iat3oa,I meant Herndon and Griffin but yea maybe Wesco develops too.
3036,2020-08-16 14:23:37,iat3oa,Mims is sidelined with a hamstring injury and was a rookie already. No knowing if that’s really anything for this year.
3037,2020-08-16 14:22:58,iat3oa,"I completely missed Mims, and I forgot crowder was pretty solid last year. Do they expect him to take another step or is that pretty much what you get since he’s like 27?"
3038,2020-08-16 14:23:51,iat3oa,Mims hurt his hamstring too
3039,2020-08-16 15:47:30,iat3oa,"Crowder did pretty well for us last year and Sam also threw a bunch to his TEs which, the word around camp is, that will be a thing this year too.

My main Hope's are that Perriman can, at least, have a year comparable to last year and that Mims develops well. I think with our two firsts we are definitely looking at drafting one of the WR prospects, even if next year might be a crapshoot."
3040,2020-08-17 01:06:13,iat3oa,He has great chemistry with Crowder but otherwise yea this is a death sentence. There will be headlines about starting the QB search again by week 8.
3041,2020-08-16 18:02:42,iat3oa,"I’m about at the point where I need to join him as well.

Don’t take that adolescent hairline for granted, kiddies!"
3042,2020-08-16 18:09:23,iat3oa,"At least we can still work the middle of the field pretty well with Herndon, Crowder, and Bell.  If the OL can be average, it shouldn't be a disaster.  Perriman and Mims are both fast enough to take the top off the defense and stretch it vertically.  We just need the blocking to give us time for longer plays to develop.  The WR depth is a serious problem though."
3043,2020-08-16 16:51:39,iat3oa,"I think Mims has a chance to be very good, but rooks rarely make an impact their first year."
3044,2020-08-16 19:25:27,iat3oa,"Adam Gase has a winning record when his starting QB is healthy and has overachieved with bad rosters 4 years in a row.

I’m not sure if he can do more than the latter, but he’s not Hue Jackson."
3045,2020-08-17 02:50:07,iat3oa,"He had a great half-year.  We were screaming at the Bucs management to cut him before the deadline so we could get a 4th round comp pick.  Hell, before then I kept posting my ""Don't Pay the Perriman"" schtick almost every week (see below).  He did get really good, especially after Evans went down, and even better when Godwin went down.

Don't pay the Perriman  
Don't even fix a price  
Don't pay the Perriman  
Cause his routes are just too imprecise, whoa, whoa....."
3046,2020-08-16 21:13:13,iat3oa,"Hogan was fantastic when he had Brady throwing to him, with Edelman, Gronk and Amendola to pull coverage away."
3047,2020-08-17 18:33:31,iat3oa,"Well, they've got Perriman and Mims now, so Hogan could change the way he plays and extend his career/usefulness."
3048,2020-08-16 15:55:31,iat3oa,"I read this as ""Hogan is my ass dude."""
3049,2020-08-16 16:56:10,iat3oa,"The difference between perriman at the beginning of last season and end of last season was night and day. He did get targets at the beginning of the seasons, and absolutely sucked dog shit, he couldn't catch a thing. Skip to the last 5 or so game and he was catching everything thrown his way, including one of the arguably best catches of the season. The guy improved last season, not because of Winston or the offense. He simply got better."
3050,2020-08-16 19:13:39,iat3oa,"On paper it sucks, but i listed a few reasons why I think its better in practice than on paper. Got any real arguments other than just saying that the jets recievers suck?"
3051,2020-08-16 19:13:38,iat3oa,"Skins, Steelers, Pats and a few more"
3052,2020-08-16 16:08:41,iat3oa,And Darnold is a fine QB. He’s had much worse.
3053,2020-08-16 15:21:51,iat3oa,/solid group
3054,2020-08-16 18:37:40,iat3oa,"That's not the GM or the coach's QB. Going into 2021 he will have been in the league for 4 years. He was drafted into a terrible situation, things might have been very different had he been drafted by another team and yes, the situation for Darnold hasn't been idea. But if he doesn't show serious progress, and I don't mean flashing for 3 games, missing another 4 to injury and looking average in others...serious progress, they will probably have a new head coach (his third in 4 years?) and the GM will likely be looking to upgrade at QB as they'll probably have yet another top 10 pick. The clock is running out"
3055,2020-08-16 21:23:31,iat3oa,Sound like random Madden names
3056,2020-08-16 17:14:55,iat3oa,How could you leave out HoFatty KB?
3057,2020-08-16 19:10:26,iat3oa,Don't forget Jerricho Cotchery!
3058,2020-08-17 02:26:19,iat3oa,"Wow Stephen Hill, we spent a few years fooling ourselves there."
3059,2020-08-16 20:30:37,iat3oa,"Cam only had a year of Steve smith. Olsen obviously was great but this tweet was only talking about receivers, so so was I lol. How would you feel if ted Ginn was the best receiver your QB ever really had? He was solid for us but he was still terribly inconsistent."
3060,2020-08-16 19:22:04,iat3oa,"We went 7-9 with one of the worst rosters in the league.

Did we do this beating bad teams?  Yes.

Is a team as bad as the Jets supposed to beat close to every bad team they play?  No."
3061,2020-08-16 16:36:27,iat3oa,The team would need a new playbook every year then. Sam knows what works so he will 'Omaha' the squad in the right direction.
3062,2020-08-16 17:33:52,iat3oa,"What does money have to do with it?  Hey you're in one of the worst situations in the league but you have money so its ok.  Do you think he doesn't wanna develop and win?  I also find it funny you feel worse for the fans, you know, who arent actually in the shitty situation at all and could just not watch lol meanwhile sam has to live this bullshit day in day out"
3063,2020-08-16 14:35:56,iat3oa,"Yeah and I’d take sanu over everyone except mims probably, just for the experience. Like we know Perriman final put together a solid year last year, but will he do it again? History says no, but who knows. Crowder might be a solid #2 again but hogan was not effective with us last year and I have no idea who smith is, so it depends on Mims getting good fast"
3064,2020-08-16 14:34:58,iat3oa,True. I also forgot Edelman was playing injured for what felt like most of last season too.
3065,2020-08-16 19:55:31,iat3oa,"His consistent failure amongst each team he’s played on, his “success” of mentoring Peyton Manning has carried him through his whole career."
3066,2020-08-16 15:58:02,iat3oa,Piss?  Shit?  Maybe cum?
3067,2020-08-16 15:28:06,iat3oa,[deleted]
3068,2020-08-16 17:59:18,iat3oa,"Yeah, I was joking."
3069,2020-08-16 14:47:42,iat3oa,"Crowder was a top slot in the league last year. He’s a really good player, he’s just not as high impact as a WR1 would be. It doesn’t help that the rest of our corps suck"
3070,2020-08-16 19:42:23,iat3oa,"If everything goes perfectly, I think we can get an 1000 yard season or two out of Crowder if everything were to go right.

He has a pretty complete game that I wouldn't say needs much improving, just needs some pieces around him that can take away some of the pressure. Hopefully Mims is one of those guys"
3071,2020-08-16 16:52:54,iat3oa,Especially this year. Most of the rookies across the league are either gonna adapt very fast or have an awful first year.
3072,2020-08-17 19:04:18,iat3oa,Depends if Perriman suddenly decides to be useful as a wide receiver and if Mims works out.  May be a pretty big IF because Perrimen's career has been a disappointment now and almost all rookies are a gamble
3073,2020-08-16 16:47:48,iat3oa,And got jealous?
3074,2020-08-16 16:57:52,iat3oa,"It’s hard to take improvements in such small sample sizes seriously when he finds himself in perfect situations, and then expect those same results when taken out of that perfect situation, but we’ll see."
3075,2020-08-16 22:42:02,iat3oa,"You didn't provide ""reasons."" If you present the most optimistic view of a something without any rational logic then it will always look better. The likelihood is that Hogan was a flash in the pan nothing player who truly sucks without Brady and aside from a minuscule sample size Perriman has sucked most of his career. Those are reasons."
3076,2020-08-16 23:23:16,iat3oa,"Maybe, I mean they’re definitely not great, I’d just personally prefer those to the jets because they each seem to at least have 1 go-to guy. Although I’m not as sold on Juju as the majority seems to be so I’m definitely interested to see how the Steelers look with Big Ben."
3077,2020-08-16 16:13:14,iat3oa,"It's year 3 and they have yet to surround him with much established talent besides Bell, Crowder and Robby Anderson who they let go this year. They've just been stuck on neutral at a time when they should be doing a lot more to help their young QB"
3078,2020-08-16 18:58:22,iat3oa,"As long as he's showing improvement, Darnold will have his full 5 years to prove he's the guy because his potential demands it, tbh.  If they get a top 2 pick next year, and Fields or Lawrence are there, then obviously there will be a decision to be made, but that will be the same for any team in that position if they don't already have an established young QB.  But if they don't have a shot at the top guys, his job is pretty secure.  They aren't going to take the 3rd or 4th QB off the board with so many other fires to put out on the depth chart when they already have a 23 year old with Darnold's potential."
3079,2020-08-16 18:25:36,iat3oa,Hall of Feast
3080,2020-08-16 18:40:36,iat3oa,Didn’t have him MVP year!
3081,2020-08-16 21:25:27,iat3oa,"Cam had 3 seasons of Steve Smith, not 1.  Looking back he also had Brandon LaFell who was a decent receiver, a halfway decent backfield, then Devin Funchess and Christian McCaffrey a bit in more recent years.  It's not like Cam has had nothing."
3082,2020-08-16 20:50:00,iat3oa,"I would say 7-9 was a great season for you guys tbh. Conserving you had Luke Falk start what, 4-6 games?"
3083,2020-08-16 20:58:05,iat3oa,"Honestly, with how everybody talks about the jets last year, you'd think they were competing with Cincinatti and Miami for the first pick. 7-9 when you were starting 2nd/3rd string QBs for half the year is not horrible considering."
3084,2020-08-16 18:21:48,iat3oa,[deleted]
3085,2020-08-16 18:03:17,iat3oa,Perriman was mostly the back half of the season too
3086,2020-08-16 20:21:05,iat3oa,In Miami he was missing his starting QB for 25/49 possible games and the worst he ever did was finish 6-10. Literally half of the games he coached he had a back up QB starting for him. No shit there has been failure. The one full healthy year he had Tannehil they won 10 games and made the playoffs.
3087,2020-08-16 20:09:56,iat3oa,"Ok, but I just don't see how that translates to it ""feeling"" like Gase is trying to achieve roster control by implying Darnold is trash for not being able to succeed with mediocre weapons. I hate when ppl reduce criticisms of Trump to ""OrAnGe mAn bAD"" but your speculation feels like ""GaSe mAn bAd."" Your second comment is completely valid, don't get me wrong, but it does nothing to support the one I initially responded to. We've been thin at WR since Decker/Marshall and with JD in the picture Gase will never have roster control. He'll have a voice in the room, but that's about it."
3088,2020-08-16 17:00:08,iat3oa,Don't tempt me with a good time
3089,2020-08-16 15:28:56,iat3oa,Shit
3090,2020-08-16 16:18:07,iat3oa,"He was great in the slot in Washington too, but yeah pretty much what you said, he’s an awesome player to have but if he’s your top wideout, it’s not really a good sign"
3091,2020-08-16 17:36:50,iat3oa,Perriman was good with Baker in 2018. Just depends which version of him shows up.
3092,2020-08-16 17:09:00,iat3oa,"I think saying he was in the perfect situation is a stretch. His best games of the season were the two games without Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, he was all alone out there essentially. But even with Godwin after Evans went down, Perriman was putting up very good numbers for a #2. I don't think he'll ever be a true 1 receiver. But a top 2 would not surprise me"
3093,2020-08-16 22:48:31,iat3oa,"Ok those are reasons.

 Perriman also looked good in 2018 when he played with Mayfield. As a player that was initially drafted in the 1st round, it wouldn't be insane to believe that he's always had the tools to succeed and that he's only now putting it all together.

He was drafted in the same year as devante Parker who was also only recently able to finally put it all together and start playing really well.


Hogan I admitted is an acceptable wr3  at best"
3094,2020-08-16 16:14:19,iat3oa,The Jets went 7-9 last year. Nothing is off the rails. He had equal passing to Josh Allen in like 3-4 less games and had a worse cast last year. It’ll be fine.
3095,2020-08-16 19:04:42,iat3oa,"I think there's a limit to how long you throw out the potential word. Year 4 under a third head coach is probably the cut off point if they get there. I don't think the bar for Darnold will be showing improvement, I think he's going to have to show that he can play a full schedule, look and perform well while he's playing and win a reasonable amount of games. 

I agree that they won't just take the third or fourth best QB prospect when they already have a QB under contract. If they're picking in the top 10 and have a shot to trade up for the best or second best QB prospect, you'd have to figure Douglas would consider packaging the picks he got for Adams along with whatever first they originally owned and try to take a QB."
3096,2020-08-16 22:42:58,iat3oa,"Oh wow you’re right, I am an idiot. Idk why I became convinced we only had a year of SSR and Cam. We called lafell stone hands and cheered when he left, and funchess is bad. With CMC I’m just talking about receivers, cause the tweet was"
3097,2020-08-16 23:00:10,iat3oa,"That's fine to think but this season there's no Jamal Adams, the defense is automatically much weaker, the schedule is much more difficult and Adam Gase is still the coach."
3098,2020-08-16 21:41:57,iat3oa,"Only three, but two were extremely winnable with a healthy Darnold (Cleveland and Philadelphia).

Plus Darnold all but certainly had Mono in our week one loss to Buffalo (by one point)."
3099,2020-08-16 18:23:47,iat3oa,"Sam didn't join the nfl to quit after 2 seasons and keep his signing bonus.  If football is all you have to look forward to, expand your horizons bro"
3100,2020-08-16 21:39:06,iat3oa,"I see your argument and it’s a valid point. I shared my personal opinion instead of facts because I’ve never really liked Gase in the NFL. He’s always been mediocre to me and has seemed like the kind of guy that doesn’t like working with others to achieve HIS goals. 

Back in Miami and now with New York, he’s gotten rid of franchise players that don’t agree with his philosophy and it seems like he never tries to work with what he’s got/given and makes excuses by keeping sub par rosters then blaming it on the GM instead of his own ineptitude. Felt like that in Miami and it feels like that now especially after the LeVeon/Adams issues."
3101,2020-08-16 17:38:34,iat3oa,He was awesome at the end of the season with the bucs. I don’t have high expectations for him but he could be a solid player.
3102,2020-08-16 18:45:58,iat3oa,I'm expecting nothing and hoping for some deep bombs.
3103,2020-08-16 17:20:41,iat3oa,"Being a primary target in a BA-Jameis offense is about as good as it gets when you’re a WR that brings speed but not much else to the table.

> His best games of the season were the two games without Mike Evans and Chris Godwin

Of course, because that meant his targets went up. That’s exactly what I’m saying here."
3104,2020-08-16 23:29:55,iat3oa,[By look good you mean catching one deep ball a game over his last 4?](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/P/PerrBr02/gamelog/2018/). Bro this is an absurd hill to die on.  What you're doing is optimistic projection. What I'm doing is accepting the data for what it is
3105,2020-08-16 16:19:05,iat3oa,"Just because it isn't off the rails doesn't mean that it's all good. These are the years where they need to surround Darnold with talent to truly see if he can be a long term solution deserving of a second contract. Every other QB from his class has had their teams invest heavily in terms of weapons: Baker with Landry, Odell and Hooper, Allen with Diggs, Brown and Beasley, Lamar with Hollywood Brown and all the investment at the running back position. Even QBs drafted later than him like Kyler Murray and Lock are getting upgrades to throw to. The Jets can and should be doing more at the position"
3106,2020-08-16 18:25:14,iat3oa,[deleted]
3107,2020-08-16 23:05:48,iat3oa,"Wait you mean where Adams clearly fired shots at the team, gase clearly said ""I want him on my team"". "" Where the Jets got a haul for him. 
Where bell said it wasn't gase and multiple guys who've played for him before have come back because they like playing for him?"
3108,2020-08-16 17:44:05,iat3oa,Worst case you can take a shot on Josh Gordon and pray.
3109,2020-08-16 17:26:28,iat3oa,"You can't just look at targets though. If you look at catch% you see that Perriman improved immensely. He had targets early in the season, he was primarily the second outside receiver for most of the season, he just never did anything other than stretch the field because he could not catch. My main point is that if you actually compare the catches he was making at the start of the season to the end, it's a night and day difference. Week 1, he dropped wide open passes that you or me could make, week 16 he's making over the shoulder sideline catches like it's nothing."
3110,2020-08-16 23:34:08,iat3oa,"An absurd hill to die on? I made 2 comments defending a wide reciever, my dude. Ok, he didn't catch alot of deep balls as the very last competent reciever on his team but he did average 100 yards and 1 td in the x-position from week 13-17. Which I would  say shows that he can competently play the position."
3111,2020-08-16 18:43:51,iat3oa,"> The Jets can and should be doing more at the position

It's kind of hard when you also have to replace every position on the OL.  Outside of overpaying Robby Anderson, there really wasn't much more they couldn't have done this year to make an impact."
3112,2020-08-16 16:20:44,iat3oa,"And he played well last year given the circumstances. 7-9. Which was better than 2018. 

Baker got all those weapons and for what? 6-10. He was a liability at QB and a bottom 5 starter last year. 

Hollywood Brown isn’t a good WR btw."
3113,2020-08-16 19:04:16,iat3oa,Oh fuck off. There is a nonzero chance you have said “shut up and dribble” in the past.
3114,2020-08-16 17:47:07,iat3oa,"And again, you’re reverting back to a very small sample size, and trying to extrapolate from that, which is bad in and of itself, but add in the fact that he’s going from a very good situation to a considerably worse situation and it’s close to pointless.

If you want to talk about catch rate, Perriman had the 7th worst catch rate in the NFL last season overall, out of 93 qualifying receivers. Even over the course of his hot streak (the 3 games both Evans and Godwin were out for), his catch rate was only around ~65%, which is about middle of the pack.

He was also the absolute worst receiver out of the 93 qualifying receivers at YAC +/-, which is a metric which measures expected YAC on reception to actual YAC on those reception using player tracking data, air yard data, etc.

In other words, like I said, he’s a receiver whose uptick in production came as a result in increased targets and a gaudy ADOT (he tied for the 3rd highest ADOT in the NFL last season). He’s a speed receiver who found himself as one of the primary targets in a BA-Jameis offense, and I doubt whether or not he’s going to be as productive outside of being a primary target in that system."

3180,2020-08-15 13:50:28,ia6qzd,"IDW and DC have partnered before on Batman/TMNT & Green Lantern/Star Trek.
Could Paramount and WB have come to a similar agreement, as Wilson Cruz & Anthony Rapp are actors from Star Trek Discovery."
3181,2020-08-15 17:57:51,ia6qzd,i’ve lived long enough to see john cena in a DC movie. my life is complete
3182,2020-08-15 16:04:29,ia6qzd,Bosslogic gets to be on that’s amazing for him
3183,2020-08-15 15:19:34,ia6qzd,"Ok, I looked up some of these names. Call me crazy but I'm really itching for some Green Lantern movie or tv show news or casting.

Matt Wilson (Matthew Wilson) actor, some actor with that name on google images looks like Hal Jordan.

Then there's this lady who quite looks like a Carol Ferris

Troian Bellisario

3185,2020-08-15 16:03:02,ia6qzd,Appreciated. Im sorry you had to go to these lengths.
3186,2020-08-15 13:13:37,ia6qzd,So much people and too much random actors if true is gonna be a hella surprise indeed 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤨
3187,2020-08-15 15:16:02,ia6qzd,"I’m excited seeing Dean Norris there. I don’t know what it would be, but he’s a fantastic actor and I’d love him in a DC role"
3188,2020-08-15 16:07:58,ia6qzd,Terry Crews? This has to be for The Suicide Squad— or maybe a voice on the game of it? Or a role in Black Adam?

3191,2020-08-15 14:57:58,ia6qzd,Funny because Geoff Johns is the only one who has the first letter in lowercase. Edit: good work!
3192,2020-08-15 20:24:55,ia6qzd,Calling it now: Tony Shaloub is our new Superman.
3193,2020-08-15 13:37:00,ia6qzd,No ray fisher???
3194,2020-08-16 05:01:11,ia6qzd,"D-Nice - Do you mean ""Denise""? :>

Dustin Nguyen - He's an artist and I think writer. He worked on Li'l Gotham among other things (unless it's actually been confirmed to be the actor)."
3195,2020-08-16 13:45:31,ia6qzd,"Holyyyy fuck Damon Lindelof is there, if they give him a dc movie or show i will scream"
3196,2020-08-16 18:04:31,ia6qzd,"Thank you! It will be great movie!   
I'm a DC fan from Russia. We unfortunately have very few DC fans. But the popular marvel. I really want to make my favorite DC universe popular in Russia. So I want to ask you what exactly do you like most about DC? What is your favorite character? I really want to focus on the coolness of DC in our social networks and forums and make DC as popular in Russia as you do. Thank you"
3197,2020-08-17 14:02:54,ia6qzd,Daughtry has been confirmed to be just performer (for now at least)
3198,2020-08-16 00:39:45,ia6qzd,"I wish i didnt have to work that day 😭😭😭
This is very informative, thank you 😊"
3199,2020-08-16 05:36:07,ia6qzd,Ziggy?? Why?? I mean I like Conscious Party as much as the next guy but that seems weird!
3200,2020-08-16 10:07:10,ia6qzd,Henry Winkler is definitively the one I’m most curious to see
3201,2020-08-15 23:28:41,ia6qzd,"Ron Funches & Alan Tudyk are both in Harley Quinn, however they were in another live action DC property together on NBC that will be debuting new episodes digitally, on HBO Max."
3202,2020-08-15 17:59:44,ia6qzd,Paramount and WB came together many times. Interstellar is one of them.
3203,2020-08-15 13:59:03,ia6qzd,So paramount would make the comics for wb movies?
3204,2020-08-15 23:34:44,ia6qzd,"Or, as both are boadway actors, with Darren Criss returning as the Music Meister, there is a sequel coming to Duet."
3205,2020-08-15 18:34:17,ia6qzd,"yeah, it really shows how far the dude got"
3206,2020-08-17 19:07:33,ia6qzd,Nice
3207,2020-08-16 01:56:48,ia6qzd,but why?
3208,2020-08-15 17:23:49,ia6qzd,no offence to them but they are not even b list actors. Troian maybe considering her family connections.
3209,2020-08-15 14:01:51,ia6qzd,Now that the filters seem to be working there is a 5 minute documentary about The Joker
3210,2020-08-18 05:33:48,ia6qzd,holy 0 _ 0
3211,2020-08-16 00:16:47,ia6qzd,My bet is Black Adam.
3212,2020-08-19 05:52:26,ia6qzd,Could just be a host
3213,2020-08-16 17:58:06,ia6qzd,Lol. Such a wonderful actor!!
3214,2020-08-15 15:12:58,ia6qzd,"Ray: Oh.... Hi Geoff. Didn't know you were going to be here...

Great username by the way. Made me chuckle."
3215,2020-08-15 14:41:35,ia6qzd,"After all the stuff he’s done, not likely"
3216,2020-08-16 22:52:24,ia6qzd,"After what he did with Watchmen, they're likely to let him do whatever. I think he'd be good to do something from Vertigo."
3217,2020-08-16 22:53:00,ia6qzd,Powerless? He's also Mr. Nobody from Doom Patrol.
3218,2020-08-15 18:06:48,ia6qzd,Plus CBS & WB own CW together
3219,2020-08-16 05:54:32,ia6qzd,Studios do this all the time. Usually one studio handles the distribution outside of the US and the other inside the US.
3220,2020-08-15 14:00:30,ia6qzd,Just speculating there maybe some sort of crossover with Star Trek Discovery
3221,2020-08-19 05:50:38,ia6qzd,Posters and other misc. Mostly black Adam
3222,2020-08-15 19:10:52,ia6qzd,"Yeah, honestly, I'm hoping for some kind of confirmation so badly that I'm seeing things where there is most likely nothing important.
They're probably just lending their voices to some project of some kind."
3223,2020-08-16 22:51:00,ia6qzd,"Interesting. Could he be a race-bend of a JSA character? If so, my bet is Dr. Mid-Nite (Charles McNider was played by a black guy in Legends of Tomorrow)."
3224,2020-08-16 22:53:33,ia6qzd,*Curb your Enthusiasm theme plays*
3225,2020-08-15 15:28:49,ia6qzd,Geoff's panel is also cancelled
3226,2020-08-15 14:06:57,ia6qzd,"Or their just using the actors, i dont see starvtrek crossing over withanything"
3227,2020-08-16 23:01:11,ia6qzd,Another possibility is Mister Terrific.
3228,2020-08-19 05:52:16,ia6qzd,What about bended wildcat
3229,2020-08-15 16:05:11,ia6qzd,He'll be at stargirl and the three jokers panel I think
3230,2020-08-15 17:23:39,ia6qzd,Link?
3231,2020-08-15 16:06:54,ia6qzd,Oh shit! For real?!
3232,2020-08-16 23:11:33,ia6qzd,Hmm. That's another possibility. I can see it.
3233,2020-08-19 06:14:10,ia6qzd,"That could work too. Arrow had Ted Grant as a Latino man, so it's not like it's never been done before."
3234,2020-08-15 20:27:01,ia6qzd,And if there's any Green Lantern announcement he'll likely be there as he's involved with that series.
3235,2020-08-16 14:23:01,ia6qzd,Its not there in the schedule of dc fandome
3236,2020-08-16 16:21:36,ia6qzd,So no proof then? Like at all...
3237,2020-08-15 15:28:54,ia6flv,"I love that part too! Along with the scene with Miranda and Steve’s mom...when Magda says “you know love” I always tear up then too ❤️ also, when Charlotte and Harry get the news about their baby. All those moments are so awesome!"
3238,2020-08-15 15:10:08,ia6flv, it was a lovely scene.
3239,2020-08-15 14:28:06,ia6flv,"Oh yeah, same here!😭"
3240,2020-08-15 19:10:52,ia6flv,"Honestly Samantha, Miranda, and Charlotte are all have good storylines in season 6 and they end up great. Only Carrie has a bad storyline, but I think that's because I can't stand the Russian lol"
3241,2020-08-21 20:53:27,ia6flv,"""You flew all night to tell me that?""

""Can you think of a better reason?""

😭😭😭😭😭😭 

Fucking Smith Jarrod, making eyes and panties water all over the globe."
3242,2020-08-18 00:20:26,ia6flv,"I loved the way they wrote her response, too. I know she didn’t say it back in the same way, but she almost said more. We’d seen the way she loved Richard, and this was an admission for us watching that what she felt for Smith was greater, and that it was potentially the most “typical” and healthy feelings she’d ever had for a man."
3243,2020-08-15 09:07:18,ia42ch,Surprised we aren’t seeing Ham in for Zaka but good to see Begley and Mutch get a chance. Still hoping for a Moz debut in Dreamtime
3244,2020-08-15 09:11:48,ia42ch,Seems like Moz isn’t up to AFL standard.
3245,2020-08-15 10:58:47,ia42ch,Congrats Walla!
3246,2020-08-15 12:57:00,ia42ch,"Huge game, hops the boys bring the pressure. Up the planes!"
3247,2020-08-16 06:29:48,ia42ch,What the fucking fuck - from Texas
3248,2020-08-15 22:30:06,ia42ch,Bring in the fridge!!!!!
3249,2020-08-15 22:30:38,ia42ch,"Someone remind me what mutch's attributes are, is he a midfielder?"
3250,2020-08-16 00:19:47,ia42ch,"Need to hit our targets on a lead in the F50. As for the game, we can match St Kilda with there speed. Essentially the same game style as ours, shut off Hill and we should be okay."
3251,2020-08-15 09:06:52,ia42ch,Essington doesn't deserve AMT
3252,2020-08-15 09:45:48,ia42ch,Have you seen a picture of the kid lately? He looks a long way off
3253,2020-08-15 22:06:59,ia42ch,He started a fair way further back than most draftees which the club was clear about. Was always going to be a long shot to play in his first couple of years
3254,2020-08-16 00:21:04,ia42ch,"He’s got endurance, and is good with contested ball. Knowing Essendon and Truck, they’ll use him as an outside ball winner. Most likely to play off Half Back."
3255,2020-08-15 09:08:33,ia42ch,I mean he is the embodiment of Essington in our Essington games.
3256,2020-08-15 12:36:47,ia42ch,How does a photo say hes a long way off?
3257,2020-08-16 00:40:45,ia42ch,Well we definitely need more of that.........  :) Hope you have a good game mutch welcome back
3258,2020-08-15 13:59:35,ia42ch,Let's just say he looks like he's on the Stringer diet.
3259,2020-08-16 03:55:36,ia42ch,I take it you haven’t seen any photos either
3260,2020-09-07 05:16:22,inzpx1,Tyreek is always a solid addition
3261,2020-09-07 05:24:17,inzpx1,I would upgrade RB
3262,2020-09-07 01:03:27,inx72c,"For your 49er vs cards critique, id add McKinnon(he’s 4K) as a cheap flyer. If this game goes shootout(which I think it will) mck will benefit a bunch as he’s looked the best receiving passes out of the back field"
3263,2020-09-07 19:19:26,inx72c,"I know Mitch is a terrible real life QB, but he can have big fantasy weeks. I will definitely throw him in some GPP lineups and take advantage of the low ownership. He’s really easy to stack with ARob and Miller"
3264,2020-09-07 12:14:17,inx72c,"You've overlooked the second string RB in GB. That's a three headed monster in that backfield, with reports of all three expected to be involved."
3265,2020-09-07 16:25:23,inx72c,Why no Gurley he's going to see atleast 15 touches an the Seahawks front 7 scares No  one
3266,2020-09-10 21:56:41,inx72c,devante parker or jarvis landry for FLX?
3267,2020-09-15 03:56:07,inx72c,Do you have a week 2 coming out?
3268,2020-09-08 06:15:19,inx72c,He'll be injured by the half. Dude is made of glass
3269,2020-09-07 19:18:22,inx72c,I’m a Packers fan and from what I’ve read it doesn’t seem likely Dillon will factor in much at all this season. He didn’t have a great camp
3270,2020-09-07 12:30:08,inx72c,"Jamaal Williams isn't someone I'm overlooking, just someone I don't see being relevant enough to play. He may get a few catches, but he's a very TD-dependent play."
3271,2020-09-07 16:44:57,inx72c,"I'm personally just not confident in Gurley being a strong option this week. It's certainly possible, I just don't see him being worth his salary. Falcons seem much more geared to pass than run the ball, but I could be hella wrong against Seattle. 🤷‍♂️"
3272,2020-09-08 16:52:56,inx72c,"Agree with you. Seahawks gave up 4.9 YPC last season and then lost Clowney. Falcons will run the ball. Not only this, Gurley is a great receiving back. Adds up to a smash play that is going overlooked."
3273,2020-09-10 22:26:51,inx72c,Personally I'd go Landry since he doesn't have Stephon Gilmore covering him like Devante Parker will
3274,2020-09-15 09:47:28,inx72c,"Yes, it will be relatively soon. I started a new job recently with a more normal schedule so my sleep schedule's a bit off, but I'll hopefully get these out more consistently either Tuesday night or Wednesday morning some time each week. I don't know it it'll be as in-depth per game, but I'll talk about key players at the very least."
3275,2020-09-08 06:16:42,inx72c,"Plus, Gurley sucks. He'll pop off a big game here and there but too risky for me"
3276,2020-09-08 17:06:40,inx72c,Falcons oline has improved Gurley will be a top five RB this season i see gurley putting up big numbers in that offense
3277,2020-09-09 01:23:15,inx72c,"Definitely not top 5 lol. Falcons won't field a top 16 line, but they will be better than what the Rams were last year by a lot. Plus, I just dont think Gurley has top 5 positional talent anymore. Cook, CMC, Barkley, Elliott, and Kamara will all finish ahead of him easily. Then you have guys such as Sanders, Drake, Jacobs, Henry and Chubb. Just isnt happening."
3278,2020-09-06 21:09:20,intwiq,This is pretty good and well thought out post like these help me keep up to date thank you. I didn’t think of osp vs Smith that’s a good ass fight right there. Some where along the line I hope thiago and Jan rematch and we might get that if Jan wins the title.
3279,2020-09-06 22:11:09,intwiq,"Love this. Only thing I disagree with is saying OSP v Smith makes no sense. I think it makes a lot of sense actually. OSP is on a 2 fight win streak at LHW against hyped up prospects in Oleksiejczuk and Menifield. He finished both and I mean realistically, he's only lost to dudes who are top 10 fights in the 205 lb division. Smith is coming off two REALLLY bad losses and has shown that he's probably not the top 5 fighter everybody thought. If he can beat a guy like OSP, it will show that he belongs somewhere in the 8-12 position. But if he loses, it'll show that he probably isn't even top 10, MAYBE top 15 material. OSP is due for a step up, Smith is due for a step down."
3280,2020-09-07 01:42:03,intwiq,"Da Un Jung is 26, just confirmed on Naver (Korea's google)"
3281,2020-09-06 22:08:42,intwiq,I love all these ideas but Jiri vs Rumble. I obviously want to see that down the line but I feel like it’s killing 2 potential hype trains in Jiri’s 2nd UFC fight and Rumbles first fight back. I think i’d rather see Jiri vs Rakic and Rumble vs the loser of Reyes vs Jan
3282,2020-09-06 21:32:21,intwiq,I really like Jiri/Rumble. Somebody's going to sleep and I think it'd probably be Jiri unfortunately but damn would that be must watch TV. I also think considering the fact Jiri will be #5 if not #4 by the time the fight happened they could shoehorn Rumble into a title shot off it if they wanted to off a KO.
3283,2020-09-06 23:17:40,intwiq,[removed]
3284,2020-09-06 21:21:20,intwiq,Sorry if my formatting is terrible. I tried my best I promise.
3285,2020-09-07 05:33:42,intwiq,Smith should retire
3286,2020-09-06 21:16:57,intwiq,The real fight the fans want is Modestas Bukauskas vs Jiri Prochazka . 2 euro Viking looking young prospect violent men
3287,2020-09-06 23:40:38,intwiq,Where does Khamzat Chimaev fit in though
3288,2020-09-07 02:43:58,intwiq,"Great post OP. Hyped for Rumble's return and him vs Prochazka would be fire. If he won that fight, I think Johnson would just fight the winner of Reyes/Jan vs. Santos/Teixeira since he is a big name and the title holder would see Rumble as a decent payday compared to perhaps Rakic or the other contenders."
3289,2020-09-07 21:25:46,intwiq,Rumble vs anthony smith is the fight to make
3290,2020-09-09 03:48:22,intwiq,"Makes me sad to see Ion done dirty like that. I guess it's not super dirty, but his losses are against some tough competition. His performance against Roundtree was unreal, this fight needs to happen, was that a one off performance or has he hit that other level?"
3291,2020-10-21 22:21:52,intwiq,"Bit late here but are you sure Da Un Jung is 32? The ufc website says he is 26 and so does tapology. 
But then sherdog says he is 32 so I'm not sure. If he is 26 that would be a much more exciting prospect."
3292,2020-09-06 23:26:08,intwiq,[deleted]
3293,2020-09-06 21:29:35,intwiq,OSP vs Smith is a damn good fight. I don’t think anyone wants to see Smith get sacrificed to another prospect.
3294,2020-09-06 23:18:29,intwiq,Ya I think that’s good too. Like I said there’s not one good option for these fights.
3295,2020-09-07 01:25:35,intwiq,This kills the modestas
3296,2020-09-07 00:44:32,intwiq,A weight class or two down
3297,2020-09-06 23:32:51,intwiq,Really? Sherdog has him at 32? Maybe they are wrong.
3298,2020-09-06 22:11:37,intwiq," Smith thought Rakic was too big for him, he's in real trouble if he fights St Preux, OSP is huge."
3299,2020-09-07 00:53:24,intwiq,Or a weight class above
3300,2020-09-07 01:37:16,intwiq,">OSP is huge.

How is he bigger than Rakic? He's shorter for one thing, and has been outgrappled by a middleweight in Mousasi."
3301,2020-09-07 08:15:00,intwiq,"I respect that you're either a true believer or a true shitposter. Either way, he dies up there"
3302,2020-09-06 19:00:22,inrphj,Conspicuously absent is Laderius Mack.
3303,2020-09-06 19:01:51,inrphj,"Aw, I was hoping Ledarius and Eiselen would make it.

Jamon Brown is the only new face on the practice squad.  He had a visit last week."
3304,2020-09-06 19:42:38,inrphj,"Blah. I’m really over having Bray. I get that he knows the system and all, but he’s never going to play and they’ll never trust him to play if they needed to. Make him a coach and put a project in there"
3305,2020-09-06 19:48:40,inrphj,The Bears are gonna rename the practice squad after Tyler Bray once he retires
3306,2020-09-06 19:03:38,inrphj,"ONE MORE YEAR OF BRAY BABY PUT THAT SHIT RIGHT INTO MY VEINSSSSSSSSS

I hope to see Horsted back on the 53, he made some plays for us last year and we’ve seen it in camp too. I’d also keep an eye on Rashad Smith who looked good but probably doesn’t have the ST value that Iggy or Woods have.  

Also wanna see Pierce replace Nall, not a fan of anything Nall really does and i’m intrigued by Pierce, maybe a less shitty Taquon Mizzell?

sad that it looks like Lil Mack didn’t pan out

edit: also, does this confirm Pineiro as our week 1 kicker?"
3307,2020-09-06 22:56:42,inrphj,I remain intrigued by Stephen Denmark
3308,2020-09-06 19:04:54,inrphj,i imagine hes on the shortlist once someones on IR and a PS spot opens
3309,2020-09-06 19:23:05,inrphj,It’s almost like he wasn’t very good aside from being related to Khalil Mack??
3310,2020-09-06 21:03:14,inrphj,I'm sure he will be back next year when he can actually play in the pre season and show his worth vs other teams
3311,2020-09-06 19:23:05,inrphj,His name means ham in español.
3312,2020-09-06 20:14:10,inrphj,"Honestly, for this year he is probably just here incase the team has a bout with COVID. If Foles and/or Trub get sick we have a QB that can slot right in with out having to learn the system."
3313,2020-09-06 19:06:48,inrphj,He was always the week 1 kicker. Cairo came in because Eddy was hurt
3314,2020-09-06 20:48:40,inrphj,"Some reporters were hinting that Nall has a unique role in the offense, but obviously couldn’t say what it was. Be curious to see if/where he lines up week 1."
3315,2020-09-06 19:07:03,inrphj,"Could be taking that kicker spot if and when Eddy stops having ""a little groin""."
3316,2020-09-06 19:27:44,inrphj,"Considering we only have one other ILB on the PS, he very likely is on a shortlist."
3317,2020-09-06 19:49:04,inrphj,People like Tom Thayer said he was undersized but looked good.
3318,2020-09-06 19:54:31,inrphj,"We're talking about the practice squad, not cracking the starting lineup. There was a good amount of praise for lil Mack in camp, thought it might translate into a developmental spot."
3319,2020-09-06 19:26:43,inrphj,"And ""Let's go!"" in Michael Jackson."
3320,2020-09-06 20:27:03,inrphj,As compared to Arlington Hambright
3321,2020-09-06 21:17:43,inrphj,That’s probably right. I need to keep reminding myself that this season isn’t going to be about anything but right now
3322,2020-09-06 19:30:05,inrphj,"Depending on the severity / recovery time, he could've been IR'd for 3 weeks to start. Heck, there's even the possibility Cairo is elevated to the 55 man week 1 roster if Eddy's groin acts up during the week."
3323,2020-09-06 19:07:40,inrphj,"yea, just wasn’t sure how serious his injury was."
3324,2020-09-06 20:15:05,inrphj,Matt Gay is available. And Gostkowski was sitting on a sofa until this weekend.
3325,2020-09-06 23:33:25,inrphj,"He's played FB in the past, but keeping five TEs you have to expect one of them will be flexed into that spot when needed."
3326,2020-09-06 20:08:09,inrphj,I dont think they are keeping a second kicker just because Eddy has a potential groin issue. I think its because they have setup precautions in the event covid takes eddy down for a few weeks.
3327,2020-09-06 20:13:37,inrphj,This
3328,2020-09-06 21:28:08,inrphj,"I think Ledarius has raw talent, but not enough technique or polish to be ready for an NFL roster. I don't think he played HS football. Buffalo was basically his introduction to organized football, and only two years I think.

Maybe he is a diamond in the rough, but it will take considerable time to develop him."
3329,2020-09-07 08:27:36,inrphj,"Didn’t we take people called Pig and Ham in the 7th? Now we have Jamon, are we just trying to piss off Jews and Muslims? Who’s next? Kevin Bacon? 😂"
3330,2020-09-06 20:21:21,inrphj,They probably want lots of money

3332,2020-09-06 23:25:16,inrphj,That?

3367,2020-09-06 18:35:25,inqou3,"Funny story about Jeremy Lynch. I saw him at a grocery store in Newcastle not long ago. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him snort as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by sighing really loudly."

I didn't really talk to them because I was only like 10/11 and was very shy to talk to them. Billy saw me struggling to do a skill (think it was a rainbow flick lol) and came to help. Meanwhile Jezza is just standing on the side telling this kid off for doing a separate skill from everyone else.

Feel bad for Billy because he genuinely seems normal, but this seems like the typical money and fame getting to someone's head.

3913,2020-09-06 19:43:16,inqou3,"1. Has taken previous charity/fan events too seriously. From swearing at refs doing charity events for free to making up conspiracies about event organisers because of his own teams under performing.
2. Tried to bully/intimidate StephenTries over a joke diss track. Even got his weird loser friend hakz (that Instagram celeb who does the angry Scottish impression)  to slur some homophobia and ""I'm going to shank you comments"" towards Stephen and their mates.
3. Genuinely believes when he was let go by Arsenal that Wenger said he was the best player on the ball he had ever seen (At a time Henry and Bergkamp were at Arsenal...)
4. Has been a bellend to fans of the F2 in the street and acts above everyone.
5. Thinks having an Audi/Lambo/insert some other material possession is worth boasting about relentlessly.
6. Has done all of the above and never offered an acknowledgement or apology when evidence of it is all over YouTube. 

He's just one of those typical kids at school that were slightly talented at something and go so hard on the self worth/better than everyone mentality that they turn into a pathetic man child. Sadly through F2 he has made a lot of money which enables him to further put himself above everyone."

Lynch was at Arsenals academy as a teenager in the early 2000s, he even claimed that he was the best player on the ball at the entire fucking club including the first team, even though he was 15 and subsequently released from the academy. Lynch has taken part in multiple YouTube football tournaments and in every single one he has often underperformed. Lynch is known to be cocky, arrogant and in general a huge knobhead.

Basically to sum up short:

Charity football game at Wembley between 4 YouTube teams. There was group games to decide who gets which pick in a draft for an ex footballer + another youtubers. During one of these the game, whilst F2 (swaz team) is losing, is cut short and Swaz Lynch (I’ll call him swaz from now) kicked off, threatening to leave the match altogether (Keep in mind it’s a charity game). 

Then another youtuber releases a diss track on him (but a joke one, not serious). Swaz takes this very seriously and gets his mate to go up to Stephen Tries (diss track guy) and start bragging about Lynch Lambo etc. 

Lynch also in the post match interview started dissing the organiser and started waffling about his sponsor (did I mention this was for charity)"

3953,2020-09-06 18:31:46,inqou3,Most of them are recognisable but I wouldn’t say that any of them are “big” celebrities
3954,2020-09-06 18:34:50,inqou3,"In past years there have been a fair smattering of fairly A-list actors and the like, such as Damian Lewis and Michael Sheen, and Gordon Ramsay is a longtime participant, but I imagine COVID has made it harder for those kinds of characters to make appearances too."
3955,2020-09-06 18:31:46,inqou3,You don’t recognise swaz lynch?
3956,2020-09-06 18:37:25,inqou3,"They're recognisable but most are either comedians or just general TV celebrities so not the kind of thing that transports abroad. Dave has won some big music awards, Serge from Kasabian is well recognisable"
3957,2020-09-06 18:35:24,inqou3,"Eh some of them. I had to look a few up though. 

Some I recognise the face but couldn’t tell you where I know them from"
3958,2020-09-06 18:39:05,inqou3,"Alfie Allen because of GoT surely? I can recognize him, Olly Murs, Dave and Pizzorno (of Kasabian)"

3966,2020-09-06 18:46:20,inqou3,The male pros play at like 10% of their ability in these sort of games. They would just be able to run rings around the women and the non-footballing celebrities otherwise and I doubt that's what the producers want coming across.

3968,2020-09-06 19:24:31,inqou3,Do you reckon we'll get to see his Lamborghini as he leaves?
3969,2020-09-07 10:35:14,inqou3,"So there's a charity competition held by Youtubers called the Wembley Cup, of which he was invited to he captain of a team of as he has a football skills channel called F2 and you know...he's decent at the whole football lark.


Anyway, in one of his group games against the worst team out of the 4, they end up going 1-0 down when the referee calls full time. One of them spots that the referee cut the game short at the 13 minute mark (games were two halves of 15 minutes) in the second half which prompts massive delays from their boys, threatening to walk off, boycotting the whole competition which was, in the end, meant to be a charity tournament and a bit of a laugh. Several hours later they ""graciously"" accept the loss and move on. Funnily enough, their team ended up winning the whole thing anyway.


On an unrelated note, he had a trial at Arsenal and, to his words, while he was the ""best on the ball"" at the whole club (did the trial at the time of the Invincible team) he wasn't great off it and that was why he didn't get picked.


So basically, he's a bit of a cock."
3970,2020-09-06 19:22:18,inqou3,"I have seen Clarke do some before the Manchester Derby. And I have no problems with it in principle, it's usually just done badly and is overly sanitised."
3971,2020-09-06 19:11:48,inqou3,I definitely don't remember him being 40 years old when I was desperate for him to play in the 2010 World Cup
3972,2020-09-06 18:23:07,inqou3,I guess that makes sense but you'd think there's enough non-English celebs living in England (especially Scottish and Welsh) to make a squad.
3973,2020-09-06 20:06:16,inqou3,Not sure if he stopped getting involved a while ago but genuinely a bit gutted Jamie Theakstone isn't involved as the sub England GK this year.

Lynch was at Arsenals academy as a teenager in the early 2000s, he even claimed that he was the best player on the ball at the entire fucking club including the first team, even though he was 15 and subsequently released from the academy. Lynch has taken part in multiple YouTube football tournaments and in every single one he has often underperformed. Lynch is known to be cocky, arrogant and in general a huge knobhead. He has been involved in controversy because those who have worked with him in the past have recently come out and talked about what a huge prick he is."

Bont is paid a mark after a <10m kick, and then the replay clearly shows it touched on the line. But umpires call apparently. Fuck outta here."

Liam Ryan was immense, an absolute joy to watch."

Fucking bullshit.

In every aspect of the word.

That is all."

4076,2020-09-06 10:55:21,injsna,Nothing really positive from that game other than that Ryan is an absolute gun. Could be a sneaky to make the AA squad?
4077,2020-09-06 11:02:02,injsna,Not surprising we lost in hindsight. Our gamestyle relies on a dominant ruckman and intercept possessions in the back half. Our dominant ruckman didn't play and the erratic i50s from the dogs removed chances of any intercept marks. We need to find another avenue to goal pretty quickly.
4078,2020-09-06 12:10:25,injsna,"The boys looked tired. Lucky to have been that close and nearly winning the game. Wish Jack kick that last goal. 

WTF is with Lyon hating on the Eagles!!! He called us the Weagles during the second quarter.

I am concerned with the goal line call and the fact they didnt look at the other angle. Its doesn't look good for the game....hope it doesn't happen in the finals

Pros: 
1.Liam Ryan is the GOAT. What a game. 
2. Tom Cole clutch goal. Awesome. (Future captain)
3. Oscar Allen big tackle

Con:
1. Nelson brain fade.
2. JK brain fade on the wing.
3. Injury to Hutch and probably Gov.

Who know how the finals plays out? Glad we are able to have  season of footy."

4083,2020-09-06 10:44:13,injsna,I don’t think I’ve ever been more salty over a loss than tonight. I’ve had a gutful. Eagles had a four day break and Dogs had nine. Now we have to back up and play Saints in four days. Fuck. Fucking well played despite the circumstances anyway boys.

Getting so close to winning without the Norm Smith winning Captain, the best Ruckman in the comp, 2 time all Australian Midfielder, and the 2 time all Australian defender and ex-Captain. And then losing like that is really dissapointing.

TBH, I was 50/50 before the match, more so when NN was a late out. Went to the gym, threw in the AirPods and tried to work off the nervous energy. Watched the last quarter on TV. I wasn't so critical of the goal umpire, nor surprised when the decision was made. The AFL camera tech is poor so these things will happen. I would love more transparency, or even a baked in system where each camera MUST be ticked off to avoid oversight. At the time, I was more concerned at some dubious handballs. The Bulldogs have some throwers in their side, especially in red time. Having said that, we made some bad decisions. McGovern & Kennedy tried to take on tackles & Darling didn't go back far enough on the mark.  I believe the directive - to play on -  might have been given to break the zone. I liked the decision to move Duggan into the mid field, he's strong, has poise & a good leg. We have to sort out our mid field and out side run, for these last two games, especially as lists will be reduced. Is Luke Foley ready? We need some line breakers."
4087,2020-09-06 10:27:36,injsna,fucking cheating scum
4088,2020-09-06 10:27:35,injsna,Sick of these fucking pathetic displays. It's infuriating watching us put in performance after performance of absolute rubbish knowing what we're actually capable of. Don't use the injuries as an excuse. We had plenty of chances to bury the game but shit kicking and brain fades have cost us again. Fucks sake.

4090,2020-09-06 10:55:01,injsna,After post match analysis kick was marked at 16m.
4091,2020-09-07 02:45:47,injsna,"If only Jack Darling didn’t get too close to the man on the mark at the end of the third, or miss 2 set shots in the last quarter especially after getting a soft free kick in a rich contest 🤔🤔"
4092,2020-09-07 04:13:19,injsna,"I agree, we didn't deserve that win at all. First quarter was fine but the other three quarters was the Bulldogs so they definitely worked for that win. The scoreboard flattered us due to all their misses. Let us not blame all those little decisions like umpiring or reviews etc, just gotta cop it on the chin and move on.  
The team must be lacking energy due to short turnarounds or whatever it may be but they not playing like how they would like compared to Optus Stadium haha..  
My main concern for the past couple of years was adapting!! We are still trying to stick to our kick-mark game and when it doesnt go our way, we crumble as we do not know how to play ""dirty footy""  
I hope this changes but I have been saying that for a little too long now which is frustrating.  
Anyways lets see how they bounce back in the next 2 matches"
4093,2020-09-06 20:44:19,injsna,I think he could dethrone Butler or Papley and get in
4094,2020-09-06 11:03:57,injsna,"I think he has a real problem with focussing. He can take the most clutch mark or kick the impossible goal where he doesn't have to think, but as soon as their is time, his mind seems to wander and his focus is gone resulting in simple errors."
4095,2020-09-06 11:58:35,injsna,Not to mention him kicking into the man on the mark.
4096,2020-09-06 14:58:16,injsna,Great player if you don’t give him time to think. He totally shat the bed with that kick.
4097,2020-09-06 11:59:27,injsna,9 day break should be classed as having a bye.

4100,2020-09-06 11:17:00,injsna,"You're a terrible troll.

We're still odds on for the top 4 and have been the best travelling side of the past 5 years - that's why we have a premiership to show for it. 

Can't wait to see you cry when we win our next game."
4101,2020-09-06 12:08:27,injsna,Are you even a troll when you're obsessed with us and it clearly affects you as a person?
4102,2020-09-07 03:12:21,injsna,I dont think he had the distance in him regardless
4103,2020-09-06 11:25:40,injsna,Yeah I don’t think it’s an issue with pressure at all. He just tends to get ahead of himself and lose focus.
4104,2020-09-06 23:14:12,injsna,To be fair looks like that bloke jumped over the mark by a fair margin.
4105,2020-09-06 10:58:06,injsna,Yeah I know but this just reminds me of the Hawthorn match of last year. Everything to play for and then bottling it whilst other good teams take their chances. A home final thrashing and then second week knockout isn't good enough.
4106,2020-09-07 09:34:04,injsna,He definitely had the distance in him. Remember this?[go to 1:46](https://youtu.be/YuCDrJdzIVM?t=106)
4107,2020-09-07 08:07:31,injsna,Cheers for the heads up. Im gonna have a loom at that.
4108,2020-09-06 11:14:27,injsna,"I'm pretty resigned to the realities of this season. Hubs, forced to play 5 games in 18 days right before finals and in the hub instead of when we were at home, injuries to key players, no second home final even if we earn it, no Perth GF to aim for etc.

I've maintained since the beginning that the asterisk is a fact of life, whatever it may mean. And lately with all of that that I mentioned it's put it into focus that this season is fucked and at this point I feel like winning one final or two would be a massive achievement but otherwise it's a write off.

Basically if the circumstances were at all normal and there was less stacked against us I would be more frustrated but I'm glad they fought it out and got so close to an almost fully fit side on a 9 day break."
4109,2020-09-06 11:26:11,injsna,I think it’s harsh to compare the two based on the circumstances.

4124,2020-09-06 01:16:12,incu9p,"Why have the commentators been so pro-SKC? They kept talking about how they’ve have so many clear cut chances and have caused us a lot of problems. 
I thought play was pretty shitty on both sides, and the goal was a little against the run of play. 
With that being said, Ramirez needs to hit the showers a little early, and we need some fresh speed.

EDIT: I posted this at half time."
4125,2020-09-06 01:47:56,incu9p,He really leveled his game up. I have no problem with him starting if he keeps this up.
4126,2020-09-06 05:07:59,incu9p,"He's always been the most frustrating midfielder in the group imo because he's always shown talent, but the guy just couldn't stop commiting bad turnovers in bad areas of the field and he could never get out of Cabrera's dog house."
4127,2020-09-06 02:33:26,incu9p,Not tonight my friend! The Dynamo channel the team of old and come from behind for a clutch finish. I haven't been this excited about watching them play in a long time.

4130,2020-09-06 02:33:02,incu9p,Never been there personally as I'm not a big BBQ person but from what I've heard from my friends and other people that it's as good as any BBQ that you can get in Texas. So go ahead and dig in.
4131,2020-09-08 00:31:14,incu9p,"If you just watched that BBQ Special on Netflix on Tootsie.... Snow's is amazing. I've only been once but it was bomb. I don't ever have time but it's def worth going... Everyone who has gone, loves it. It's a bit closer to Austin than it is to Houston. It's in a weird spot because both cities have amazing barbecue but def worth the drive to check her out. She's only open once a week!

Pinkerton's, Truth's, Corkscrew and Tejas are in my top 4 with Pinkerton and Truth's being closest to the city (there's the OG Truth in Brenham which I never tried but that's even farther away than Tejas and Corkscrew but the one in Houston is great too). These four and Snow's are all on [the top 50 list](https://www.texasmonthly.com/food/the-list-the-top-50-barbecue-joints-in-texas/) as top 10 or top 15 at at least.

The rest of my top 10 has Roegels, Killen's, Brett's, Virgie's, Brook's Place, and maybe Gaitlin's or Pit Room (in no particular order.. everyone does something different and are amazing but they aren't top 5 because they can be inconsistent . I know Brook's has been on top texas list before and so has Roegels. Roegels is my usual go to spot tho."
4132,2020-09-06 11:12:29,incu9p,"If you're doing barbecue and Houston you may want to hit Corkscrew (Spring), Tejas Chcolate Craftory (Tomball), and Truth (Brenham) as well. They're all close to Houston and all TM top 10 along with Snow's."
4133,2020-09-06 01:19:21,incu9p,"If you're watching on ESPN+ its because its the SKC broadcast. And to the Ramirez point: Elis, Manotas, and Lassiter have the chance to seriously change the game and it's just a matter of when they come on because Ramirez hasn't looked good enough."
4134,2020-09-08 01:21:14,incu9p,Thanks for all the info! We are really hoping to get down there next year and check a few places out.

4224,2020-09-06 00:20:48,inc5cr,_Elis sees the SKC lineup and slides over to the left side_
4225,2020-09-06 00:21:32,inc5cr,PV getting wild with these lineups. I dig the creativity and versatility.
4226,2020-09-06 00:23:57,inc5cr,Portal cup this year is blowouts only. Who is gonna win by 3+ today?!?
4227,2020-09-06 00:25:05,inc5cr,No fans in stadium for the Dynamo? Is that a band playing music in the background?
4228,2020-09-06 00:25:11,inc5cr,Are they piping in music?
4229,2020-09-06 00:27:57,inc5cr,"So far in 2020 MLS Regular Season, not a single team has been able to shut us out. Pretty interesting stat IMO."
4230,2020-09-06 00:28:31,inc5cr,AV guys seem to be struggling with replays lol
4231,2020-09-06 00:33:38,inc5cr,"Thank goodness for the rain delay, only missed 12 minutes instead of 32 due to my fantasy draft. How are we lookin', boys?"
4232,2020-09-06 00:35:03,inc5cr,"KC having a bit of fun with the lineup formation

 https://twitter.com/SportingKC/status/1302399194355834880?s=19"
4233,2020-09-06 00:42:32,inc5cr,"I think that was good defending from Puncec. The ref obviously had a better view, but he won the ball 1-on-3."
4234,2020-09-06 00:46:05,inc5cr,Harry and Lloyd tuxedo derby
4235,2020-09-06 00:47:59,inc5cr,Megging Busio *chef's kiss*
4236,2020-09-06 00:51:57,inc5cr,"Welp, based on the goal comments, my stream is about 40 seconds behind. Not anything enjoyable knowing your team is going to give up a goal and having to wait for it.

Also, that's a clean finish :/"
4237,2020-09-06 00:58:08,inc5cr,please bring elis later on
4238,2020-09-06 01:34:20,inc5cr,"The difference between this year and the last couple years is we know we have guys like Manotas, Elis, and now Lassiter as options off the bench in a tight 1-0 game."
4239,2020-09-06 01:38:24,inc5cr,LET'S FUCKING GO
4240,2020-09-06 01:39:57,inc5cr,That's ultimately on Kinda for me. So sloppy in a bad spot.
4241,2020-09-06 01:41:58,inc5cr,Shelton has had some really bad passes/decisions this game
4242,2020-09-06 01:51:46,inc5cr,"Another 1-1 draw incoming

EDIT: if only"
4243,2020-09-06 01:56:50,inc5cr,"We're going to have a third straight 1-1 game, aren't we?"
4244,2020-09-06 01:59:43,inc5cr,I don't like this at all.
4245,2020-09-06 01:59:49,inc5cr,Quintero reminds me of the Italians from kicking and screaming
4246,2020-09-06 02:10:47,inc5cr,"EVERYBODY!

Edit: well that was a lot of nothing"
4247,2020-09-06 00:50:23,inc5cr,Wow that was beautiful
4248,2020-09-06 01:04:22,inc5cr,Ramirez couldn't hit water if he fell out of a boat.
4249,2020-09-06 02:00:02,inc5cr,Kiki Struna is a great name
4250,2020-09-06 02:04:59,inc5cr,We had that coming
4251,2020-09-06 00:51:04,inc5cr,HELL YEAH HURTADO!!!
4252,2020-09-06 00:51:05,inc5cr,THANK YOU HURTADO.
4253,2020-09-06 00:51:13,inc5cr,That was a fucking beautiful pass from Kinda
4254,2020-09-06 01:03:04,inc5cr,Thank you post
4255,2020-09-06 01:39:23,inc5cr,ELIS GOOOAAAL!! WE GOT A GAME!
4256,2020-09-06 02:04:52,inc5cr,"Welp....so much for the draw, looks like a L tonight"
4257,2020-09-06 02:04:58,inc5cr,Subs scoring goals. I love this!
4258,2020-09-06 00:24:48,inc5cr,so are they broadcasting crowd noise in the stadium?
4259,2020-09-06 00:27:03,inc5cr,Wtf is this formation Sporting.
4260,2020-09-06 00:30:17,inc5cr,Anyone know what’s up with Pulido?
4261,2020-09-06 01:35:26,inc5cr,Yesss Elis & Lassiter lets go
4262,2020-09-06 01:54:25,inc5cr,No life to the offense right now and Houston isn’t just going to roll over and let us have a goal like our defense does for them.
4263,2020-09-06 02:00:54,inc5cr,I’m not used to us being so bad in possession. We used to lead the league almost every year. I feel like these last 3-4 games we have been around 40-45%
4264,2020-09-06 02:09:57,inc5cr,I fucking hate this.
4265,2020-09-06 02:13:28,inc5cr,GG Houston
4266,2020-09-06 02:13:34,inc5cr,I'm hurt
4267,2020-09-06 01:41:13,inc5cr,That’s some serious Darwinism.
4268,2020-09-06 02:05:35,inc5cr,God. Fucking. Damn it.
4269,2020-09-06 02:05:48,inc5cr,That’s a beauty of a header right there.
4270,2020-09-06 02:13:56,inc5cr,Fuck this.
4271,2020-09-06 01:39:25,inc5cr,Fucking fuck. Can we please beat these creamsicle fucks?
4272,2020-09-06 00:24:49,inc5cr,Anyone else have weird gray lines at the top left and bottom right corners of screen?
4273,2020-09-06 00:25:55,inc5cr,anyone have a stream?
4274,2020-09-06 01:39:20,inc5cr,DQ! Blizzards for everyone!
4275,2020-09-06 01:58:44,inc5cr,What is up with showing replays when the ball is in play?
4276,2020-09-06 01:59:38,inc5cr,Quintero taking Memo’s spot centrally?  I like this option.
4277,2020-09-06 01:04:00,inc5cr,"Okay, breeeeeeeeathe."
4278,2020-09-06 02:10:43,inc5cr,uh oh anxiety attack time
4279,2020-09-06 02:04:35,inc5cr,Fuck this team
4280,2020-09-06 05:09:29,inc5cr,"Wonder if PV has been at the helm too long, might be good for the team and the coach to part ways, just speculating"
4281,2020-09-06 00:17:01,inc5cr,ayy lindsey's playing let's go
4282,2020-09-06 02:06:18,inc5cr,#UNBELIEVABLE JEFF
4283,2020-09-06 02:16:57,inc5cr,Should've had a win against Dallas and should've had a draw tonight. So fucking frustrating
4284,2020-09-06 00:29:19,inc5cr,"Games in empty stadiums are super boring to watch. You don’t need to pack 20,000 fans in there but like 2 or 3 thousand would make it much more lively without that much risk to safety."
4285,2020-09-06 01:38:46,inc5cr,I can't believe you've done this
4286,2020-09-06 01:38:38,inc5cr,welp
4287,2020-09-06 18:35:39,inc5cr,"Look at what you did! LOOK AT IT!!!

😭"
4288,2020-09-06 01:18:53,inc5cr,"That bad, eh? I've been watching Orlandta"
4289,2020-09-06 00:55:37,inc5cr,"I will die on the hill that Shelton has always been a quality player, he just needed to learn to be aggressive and gain the finishing touch. Evidently Germany did him wonders."
4290,2020-09-06 00:54:17,inc5cr,Oh man truly a beaut. Shelton almost made a muck of it but glad Hurtado cleaned up.
4291,2020-09-06 02:06:26,inc5cr,The shorts really show it. The dark orange of a guy who has been working hard is so clear.
4292,2020-09-06 00:36:12,inc5cr,MLS best XI hair for sure.
4293,2020-09-06 00:33:56,inc5cr,I think the big European leagues agree with you.
4294,2020-09-06 01:49:39,inc5cr,PRO. IS. TRASH
4295,2020-09-06 02:05:08,inc5cr,Easily happened 15+ times tonight
4296,2020-09-06 02:06:21,inc5cr,Could have been two defenders per fucking player at that point.
4297,2020-09-06 00:49:25,inc5cr,"Probably hit the shot button expecting the pass to go to someone else.

Always happens to me."
4298,2020-09-06 01:32:05,inc5cr,"That's particularly interesting to me because, IMO, our midfield seems markedly improved."
4299,2020-09-06 01:39:17,inc5cr,It's a side-effect of Busio showing much more ambition with his passes than Ilie. Ilie often shuttles the ball or passes back to Besler to recycle possession whereas Busio looks for the killer ball often
4300,2020-09-06 02:26:00,inc5cr,Upvoted for your name lmao
4301,2020-09-06 00:28:04,inc5cr,Fotmob never ever gets formations right
4302,2020-09-06 00:28:18,inc5cr,"Nothing to see here, same ole, same ole"
4303,2020-09-06 01:56:05,inc5cr,"The answer? Kinda off, Reid on. 200IQ move from Vermes."
4304,2020-09-06 01:56:32,inc5cr,fun while it lasted
4305,2020-09-06 02:22:46,inc5cr,50% in a split second.
4306,2020-09-06 02:09:05,inc5cr,Russell has been way below his normal level this season. Gerso is the same. Kinda has looked bad since the restart. And almost all of our defense is old and slow
4307,2020-09-06 18:38:24,inc5cr,"Carter’s got those dank nugs yooo! 

Their broadcasts are so painful sometimes... They coddle our guys too but at one point even they had to take a jab at “Hurtado Island” trying to go 1 on 5 lmao."
4308,2020-09-06 00:39:08,inc5cr,"And, unfortunately, some are absolutely maddening. That's why y'all have him now."
4309,2020-09-06 00:39:57,inc5cr,"He's apparently ""day to day."""
4310,2020-09-06 00:39:59,inc5cr,"Day to day, someone else in the thread said."
4311,2020-09-06 18:45:07,inc5cr,Minor muscle injury. PV has said he doesn’t want to risk a situation like Josef Martinez by playing Pulido before he’s ready.
4312,2020-09-06 01:45:36,inc5cr,"On desktop Reddit your flair is DC United. You can fix that by changing to any other flair, than back to Dynamo."
4313,2020-09-06 18:33:10,inc5cr,Arguably what limited our chances in the final third the most all game... idk what was going on with him! Off night 🤷🏻‍♂️
4314,2020-09-06 02:12:26,inc5cr,The one thing Covid couldn't change.
4315,2020-09-06 02:37:27,inc5cr,Yeah but unfortunately most of that was spent explaining to Lindsey that you have to stand 10 yards away on a restart.
4316,2020-09-06 00:25:36,inc5cr,"FWIW, the betting odds are SKC +180 and Dynamo +130, so not great. I would feel bad about both."
4317,2020-09-06 00:27:41,inc5cr,Only four teams have fans last I looked
4318,2020-09-06 00:26:19,inc5cr,"Yes, part of the simulated crowd noise."
4319,2020-09-06 00:35:34,inc5cr,Get anyone good?
4320,2020-09-06 00:59:49,inc5cr,Why wait?
4321,2020-09-06 18:31:02,inc5cr,I WISH.... “we suck againnnnnnn”.gif
4322,2020-09-06 02:17:26,inc5cr,"Normally you wouldn't pick a guy name Kiki to back you in a street fight, but he's 100% the guy I would pick from the Dynamo squad."
4323,2020-09-06 01:40:38,inc5cr,Flair checks out lol
4324,2020-09-06 00:30:18,inc5cr,"I appreciate the experimentation, but there's definitely a feeling lately that we're just throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks."
4325,2020-09-06 00:31:46,inc5cr,Picked up a knock and is day to day apparently
4326,2020-09-06 02:03:45,inc5cr,Feel like part of it’s by design. I don’t see us itching to get the ball for every single minute. A lot of times we seem content with the other team having possession and keeping them in less dangerous spots. I’m ok with that.
4327,2020-09-06 00:25:59,inc5cr,I do on ESPN+
4328,2020-09-06 00:28:11,inc5cr,Check DM
4329,2020-09-06 00:29:30,inc5cr,Local channel 55.1 if you have an antenna. Other channel is sd
4330,2020-09-06 00:23:02,inc5cr,"He’s on his natural side tonight, so keep that in mind. I am nervous though."
4331,2020-09-06 02:19:53,inc5cr,A draw? How you figure that?
4332,2020-09-06 00:56:42,inc5cr,"Shelton has always made the guys around him better, he just could never put the ball in the net."
4333,2020-09-06 01:52:31,inc5cr,PRO. IS. TRASH.
4334,2020-09-06 02:37:07,inc5cr,Ask him why he has that as a username
4335,2020-09-06 01:50:56,inc5cr,"Thanks, I changed it."
4336,2020-09-06 02:51:43,inc5cr,"A little of both. Lindsey was trying to speed things up and showed his frustration/inexperience in the process. He definitely didn't help.

Either way, the time wasting wasn't nearly as egregious as our match against Dallas a few days ago."
4337,2020-09-06 00:28:53,inc5cr,The state says we're eligible for up to 25%. Not sure if there are any city or county restrictions that are limiting at this moment. I think they are talking about adding them in for a match in two weeks.
4338,2020-09-06 00:42:03,inc5cr,"my strategy has always been ""just draft all the chiefs,"" so nowadays that tends to work out well"
4339,2020-09-06 03:39:44,inc5cr,"if Lassiter chips and Christian finishes it could have been 4 - 1 easily...

people cling to ideals for some reason."
4340,2020-09-06 01:00:15,inc5cr,"I always believed in 2018 that, despite scoring only one all season, he created half the goals scored when he was on the field."
4341,2020-09-06 02:47:23,inc5cr,Cause you touch me at night.
4342,2020-09-06 00:46:42,inc5cr,"I did that in a hockey draft one year with the Flyers and somehow won my league. I usually only get to watch 2-3 games a year, and they're my team. People weren't to happy about it, haha."
4343,2020-09-06 01:06:48,inc5cr,"There's no way I'll be able to find the video because the MLS website's search function isn't very good, but one of the analysts put up a video that showed how well Shelton worked with Gutierrez. Shelton just dragged defenders all over the field horizontally, and Gutierrez was really good at knowing when space was going to form. So a lot of Guru's goals and assists came because of Shelton's smart movement."
4344,2020-09-06 03:39:27,inc5cr,Only when you ask nicely
4345,2020-09-06 01:18:09,inc5cr,"Exactly! It's like he helped create goals by not touching the ball, lol."
4346,2020-09-06 00:15:52,inc044,Why is it so difficult to watch these games?
4347,2020-09-06 02:06:32,inc044,"Well, that was a bummer"
4348,2020-09-06 00:16:49,inc044,I'm drinking Boulevard the Calling tonight.  How about you guys?
4349,2020-09-06 00:55:48,inc044,"Sick little no-look from Gadi, great run by Khiry, great right place right time finish by Mahomes’ Doppleganger."
4350,2020-09-06 01:40:45,inc044,"This is as bad as I’ve seen us defensively in Peter’s time. Our marking is atrocious. Every game we leave someone open on the back post with 10 yards of space in our box. 

I don’t know what the announcers are smoking, Lindsey has been awful and Zusi hasn’t been a good winger in years."
4351,2020-09-06 02:04:56,inc044,Are you fucking kidding me.
4352,2020-09-06 00:37:55,inc044,I would take Sinovic 10/10 times over Lindsey
4353,2020-09-06 00:14:54,inc044,No Pulido again. Is he hurt?
4354,2020-09-06 02:14:04,inc044,This team needs some changes.
4355,2020-09-06 02:20:55,inc044,Anyone shocked that SKC concedes in the late minutes of the game? No?
4356,2020-09-06 02:56:48,inc044,"I know it’s more complex, but Vermes refuses to clog up in front of the front 4, which is the issue, and has been for 3 years now. Moving from Nagamura, Mustivar and then the aging, now absent Espinoza and we let players be comfortable on the ball, sideline to sideline basically from the 18 to the 30 yard space, the solution is to move to a 4-2-3-1, not pull in a third slow CB."
4357,2020-09-06 00:46:56,inc044,"Small sample size so far, but Dia has been pretty crafty thru 26."
4358,2020-09-06 02:18:20,inc044,"What an utterly underwhelming 2nd half. Cascade of weak turnovers as soon as any attack forward started. 2nd half khiry had a ton of giveaways. Johnny and Gerso were invisible when they cane on. Bus was quiet. No chemistry at all. An ok first half, but you’re not going to win with sloppy 2nds like that. They just looked exhausted. EDIT: 78 pct passing accuracy, lost duels 34 - 58. Ouch."
4359,2020-09-06 02:18:51,inc044,Did the Glass family mentor our owners? Putting discount players on the field and telling us they are trying to win.
4360,2020-09-06 00:14:11,inc044,I can dig the line up. Let’s see if Linsey learned from his mistakes
4361,2020-09-06 00:18:01,inc044,"Lmao I know right, I just canceled my cable. I use footy bite now"
4362,2020-09-06 02:07:05,inc044,Expected but a bummer
4363,2020-09-06 01:27:34,inc044,Guess
4364,2020-09-06 00:51:20,inc044,Vermouth on the rocks
4365,2020-09-06 01:11:30,inc044,Rum old fashioned
4366,2020-09-06 00:21:59,inc044,Coors Light.
4367,2020-09-06 02:44:21,inc044,I was AT boulevard drinking the calling and not watching the match. Looks like I made the right decision.
4368,2020-09-06 08:11:42,inc044,It's Bob's season
4369,2020-09-06 02:07:59,inc044,They are paid by SKC so never a real comment only propaganda
4370,2020-09-06 02:06:51,inc044,I’m getting real tired of the same bullsh*t leading to our downfall. This team is getting real hard to watch.
4371,2020-09-06 00:52:07,inc044,Our real hometown hero...
4372,2020-09-06 04:14:27,inc044,"Pretty sure I watched Zusi outrun Lindsey, back to the box to defend, in the first half. No excuse for that, IMO."
4373,2020-09-06 00:22:35,inc044,Yes injured but not on the injury report because....fuck the fans
4374,2020-09-06 02:19:22,inc044,"Also, playing old, no longer good players because we know their name."
4375,2020-09-06 00:26:15,inc044,"ME - Game is on ESPN+, so I get ESPN+
ESPN+ - BLACKED OUT IN KC
ME - WTF"
4376,2020-09-06 02:16:25,inc044,Username checks out
4377,2020-09-06 02:08:06,inc044,I was just asking myself why do I watch? Only thing that could make 2020 worse is 2019 Sporting KC showing up.
4378,2020-09-06 02:15:25,inc044,Chiefs are back this week so at least we'll have something else to watch
4379,2020-09-06 15:59:25,inc044,"I mean, haven't they basically already showed up?  We're unable to finish games a lot of the time. Unavailable players are starting to pile up, some of whom have no explanation, we always feel like we're Melia magic away from embarrassing defeats, we can't finish for shit.

We have now been quoted at 5/2 for relegation which will not happen!

Blackpool and Bristol Rovers are expected to finish around the 8th - 14th position range and I believe that should we keep track with these two teams during the first half dozen games there will be a possible play-off push.

Clearly in Hollywood,

Laying on the screen,

You need something I can never give,

Fake water all across the road,

It's gone now the night has come but,

You can't fight it,

You can't breathe,

You say something so loving but,

Now I've got to let you go,

You'll be better off in someone new,

You know it hurts me too,

You look so broken when you cry,

One more and then I'll say goodbye”

I just didn't care

Silly (AP) by Denise Williams


Silly of me to think that you
Could ever know the things I do
Are all done for you
Only for you
Silly of me to take the time
To comb my hair and pour the wine
And know you're not there

You're just a lover out to score
And I know that I should be looking for more
What could it be in you I see
What could it be...

Silly of me to go around
And brag about the love I've found
I say you're the best
Well, I can't tell the rest
And foolish of me to tell them all
That every night and day you call
When you could care less...

Eddie Vedder - Guarantueed

On bended knee is no way to be free  
Lifting up an empty cup, I ask silently  
That all my destinations will accept the one that's me  
So I can breathe

Circles they grow and they swallow people whole  
Half their lives they say goodnight to wives they'll never know  
Got a mind full of questions and a teacher in my soul  
And so it goes

Don't come closer or I'll have to go  
Owning me like gravity are places that pull  
If ever there was someone to keep me at home  
It would be you

Everyone I come across in cages they bought  
They think of me and my wandering but I'm never what they thought  
Got my indignation but I'm pure in all my thoughts  
I'm alive

Wind in my hair I feel part of everywhere  
Underneath my being is a road that disappeared  
Late at night I hear the trees they're singing with the dead  
Overhead

Leave it to me as I find a way to be  
Consider me a satellite forever orbiting  
I know all the rules but the rules did not know me

But he's so damn likable. Last night, when Joc was 0 for his last 1,297, Dave Roberts was telling Kershaw that he wasn't going back to the mound, and Joe and Orel were really focused on their conversation. Joc then calmly walked by Kersh, and without either one of them saying a word, and as Doc was still talking to Kershaw, Joc and Clayton high-fived.

Sometimes, it's the little things.

4610,2020-09-05 17:34:41,imvi4j,Meh.  The Dodgers are an extremely well-run team that built it from the ground up.   I would give anything to have the Dodgers ownership group.

4614,2020-09-05 05:31:13,imvi4j,Are you kidding me? Senzatela was really solid today. And Givens wrapped up the 6th well. It was Bud leaving him in and over taxing his arm that doomed him. Rest of the bullpen sucked though.
4615,2020-09-05 12:20:21,imvi4j,"At this point he can go. I actually place a large portion of the blame for this slump on his shoulders. Where in the fuck has he been this season? 11-3 start wasn’t good enough for him?

4622,2020-09-05 15:05:35,imvi4j,"I mean, it's only a 60 game season, and he's got 14 appearances (14.2 innings). That's about on track with the rest of bullpens across the league. For the Rockies, the leader is Estevez with 18 appearances. I think it's more that his ERA of like, 1.60 was not sustainable. His ERA is still like 2.45, which is really good."
4623,2020-09-05 04:08:06,imug8k,"That Devonte trade is disrespectful lol. That package should be around the mark for Batum or Rozier alone as a salary dump. You ever seen a team dump a contract with 2.5 remaining years for that cheap? Cost the Raptors multiple picks to dump DeMarre Carroll.

Swap Batum out for Rozier at least(helps Hornets get rid of a player who actively kills our development but a good fit in Philly, Philly don’t need Batum expiring because Tobias/Ben/Embiid kinda locks up long term cap flexibility for them anyway), and yeah would need a couple of this years 2nd rounders, a future first.

Wonder what you think about: Devonte Zeller and Rozier for Horford, Shake, Zhaire, 21, 34, 36, future first?

Shake becomes a bit redundant with Terry(Terry can guard small guards if you guys teach him proper technique navigating screens, he’s quick enough). I want to ask for JRich but I feel like 1. He’s a good trade chip 2. If y’all wannawin, I think JRich still gotta close games next year and if you add Tae shift JRich more offball he’ll do better. Can’t close with Tisse Ben and Embiid together."

They should take this in a hearbeat tbh. Devonte' would work well with Simmons and Embiid as a genuine secondary ball handler/playmaker. He isn't bad on d imo but I'm not really the best judge on that.



----


**From the Hornets POV:**


###It's biggest, fattest ***nope***

I'm personally not opposed to taking on Horford, but not giving up Devonte' for it. Yes he's 25, but I still think we need him for the next couple of years. Also a bit of a fan favourite.


Also the Batum thing, at this point there's basically no need for the Hornets to go out of their way to get rid of Nic, he's expiring and exchanging for an equally chunky and longer contract is not smart



-----


The idea of a Horford has already [**been discussed at length in this thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/ijz7f4/what_would_you_accept_for_horford/). As you can see there are some mixed opinions


One trade that I've seen banded about is something along the lines of **Horford/Thybulle/picks for Zeller and Rozier.**


Zeller would instantly be one of the best bench pieces in the whole league and gives a genuine starter quality backup for Joel, while Rozier offers energy and absolute lights out shooting on the catch and shoot.

Like seriously, for all his flaws with the ball in his hands, Rozier was ridiculous on catch and shoot. Like top 5 in the league I'm pretty sure. You can hide his flaws on offence when you've got such a star ball handler and playmaker in Simmons so he won't have to run ineffective pick and rolls half the time. Rozier's job would be just to spot up, and play D against 1's with his rangey length while Simmons guards the star wings



-----


Philly could then line up something like this:


PG: Rozier, Milton

SG: Richardson, Korkmaz

SF: Harris

PF: Simmons

C: Embiid, Zeller



That's a solid 8-man rotation imo on paper. The question is, is it better than last years? Does that really matter though since you're getting off of Horford and Zeller would be expiring at the end of the season anyway and Rozier only has two years left?"
4625,2020-09-05 04:16:22,imug8k,You’re asking the hornets to give up their current best player and take on a massive contract for Thybulle and 21 lol.
4626,2020-09-05 06:15:42,imug8k,"In No trade do we give up Devonte Graham and get back Horford. There would have to be a third team involved that gives us a very valuable asset. Not only do I think the organization values Devonte that much, but that's just without mentioning Horford's batum-esque contract.

Take Devonte out of the deal, and it's still not even something Charlotte is running to the league office with. Maybe swap him with Monk and then build on that"
4627,2020-09-08 00:48:11,imug8k,We take on Horford as a favor. So we need picks and/or Zhaire or Matisse.
4628,2020-09-05 04:35:17,imug8k,"So is your thought to just clear everything? With Zeller, Rozier and Devonte. I think that’s a fair counter offer I’m surprised by zeller vs batum. I get he’s paid well and expiring but still a solid rotation player. 

Hmm I think I would lean towards yes maybe examine the pics involved. It also helps the sixers for future trades since they don’t have any mid tier salaries. I think the sixers can then move Richardson and Rozier or Richardson and zeller for something. I’m not sure I’d want the future pic or maybe keep the seconds this year and then future first or other future seconds, but those are the smaller details. Plus we keep Thybulle, who we value. So I’d probably do it or something close."
4629,2020-09-05 04:22:30,imug8k,"Thanks for the thorough reply, and the link to previous discussion. So Hornets fans would rather move off of zeller than batum?  I’m a little confused he’s at least still a solid rotation player on an expiring vs batum who at this point just isn’t. 

I mean there’s definitely the frame work for something. And I totally understand not wanting to move Graham I was surprised to hear that on the pod and wondered if there was some red flag about him I wasn’t aware of."
4630,2020-09-05 04:46:03,imug8k,"I’m not asking, it was discussed by 2 decently respected nba reporters. I was just bringing it up. I also included more assets in my original post than horford/Thybulle and 21, which I didn’t think was quite enough either. I agree that’s like no shit for the sixers and a little thin for the Hornets that’s why I was asking if the other assets were interesting enough or perhaps something similar with Rozier. 

How much do you think Devonte Graham will make on his next contract? He is about to come into a huge payday, and yes I understand he’s a good player. Just trying to have a dialogue and didn’t see a daily trade/off season thread or anything."
4631,2020-09-05 04:39:52,imug8k,"I think the idea is Batum offers nothing to Philly. If y’all want Nico you can have him, but Cody is probably ideally a 15-20 MPG backup C. He’d instantly be the best backup C in the league IMO, his impact is great he just doesn’t have knees anymore.

But if we move Tae we deserve either a bunch of solid assets or a good future asset. Tae would have good value on the trade market. So I think that’s around the level of assets we’d need.

We should tank for Cade basically and yeah kinda clear the decks. Tae I don’t wanna lose but he could cost a lot in free agency. This trade would open up more touches for Malik at least who’s our best player when given opportunity, and gives Miles and Cody Martin and our draft picks a chance to develop more too.

Idk actually it’s just impossible to justify losing Tae outside of the FA stuff and cashing in whilst his value is high because he makes everybody better. I’d hate to lose him for nothing; I think most trades involving Philly don’t have him because Philly won’t give up the big asset we’d need for him. But I think Tae basically solves Philly’s halfcourt O issues and really unlocks Ben on the short roll."
4632,2020-09-06 00:23:03,imug8k,"Including Devonte is a nonstarter
Really any of our vets could be traded though"
4633,2020-09-05 04:26:24,imug8k,"We’d rather move Rozier than anyone. Zeller is just doing y’all a solid tbh, we could more than easily keep him and play him with Horford. Embiid/Horford worked whenever Embiid tried, Cody tried always and is very skilled.

But if you lose Horford you are down a backup C and y’all don’t have cap. This trade would be your best chance to get an actual good backup C you can play come playoff time unlike KOQ/Pelle. Unless y’all wanna go Scott at the 5. Cody would be a top 15 C if he didn’t have busted knees; but he can play 15-20 a night off the bench for sure, and come playoff time that’s all you need. To be honest he’s not far off Horford impact wise. Very underrated player."
4634,2020-09-05 05:01:41,imug8k,I’m not really a numbers guy but the team’s probably looking to extend him for multiple years for maybe like $13 mil a year.
4635,2020-09-05 05:03:26,imug8k,"I agree with all of that. He really helps Philly, they literally have no one on the team to throw an entry pass to embiid besides Simmons, or capable of initiating an offense or shot creation. Plus he’s a legit high volume 3 point shooter, 5th most makes in the league last season. And unfortunately I know all too well about tanking. 

I mean I get it either way with Graham. And now is the time to trade him if you don’t think you’ll resign him. Whether this is the best offer for him I don’t know. You swap out Rozier and zeller cash for extra year with horford, 21, shake who probably has similar value to that pick with 3 more years on his contract of less than 2 million per, a future first and 2 high seconds for graham. That seems like a lot."
4636,2020-09-06 03:31:15,imug8k,"Trading Devonte' shouldn't be a non-starter.

Trading Devonte' for that garbage, however..."
4637,2020-09-05 05:16:36,imug8k,"I remember seeing zeller outplay Dwight against the sixers, and he’s always had solid games when I’ve watched. 

What about the other poster’s offer of 
Graham/rozier/zeller

For horford/shake/21/34/36 and future first?"
4638,2020-09-05 05:06:12,imug8k,"Oh I see him making as much or more than rozier in that 18-22 per year range. And thought maybe that’s why you’d consider moving him. To keep the cap open, while gaining additional assets."
4639,2020-09-06 03:40:36,imug8k,What I meant was in a horford dump it's a nonstarter
4640,2020-09-05 05:17:56,imug8k,I’m the same guy who proposed that lol. Yeah Cody’s never backed down from Embiid even despite often getting overpowered
4641,2020-09-05 05:34:34,imug8k,See what FVV gets. If FVV gets 25-ish Tae will probably get 20+ given 2021 lots of teams will have cap space.
4642,2020-09-06 03:49:49,imug8k,"Ah, true.  Unless Simmons is going on the table but that would be dumb."
4643,2020-09-05 05:19:37,imug8k,"Ha that’s what I get for late night mobile Reddit in bed 😂 and again thanks for replies, good night."
4644,2020-09-05 12:54:54,imug8k,"Hey random follow up but what are you thinking for your pick? I’m not in love with the current consensus mock draft top 3 on Edwards, wiseman, and ball. I like Killian Hayes a lot, and I know a reach at 3 but love Devin Vassell. I just value that archetype of player more than most a good shooting 2 way wing, every team needs more of them, and there’s just so few actually good ones available."
4645,2020-09-05 13:01:38,imug8k,"Trade down tbh. My favourite guys in the draft for us are Maledon Vassell Haliburton(could use a big SG who can switch down the road hopefully). All are available at 8. Nnaji is my favourite big man in the class, hopefully we could acquire a pick in the 20s(Horford + #21 for Rozier?) and select him. Think he could be better than Wiseman and Okongwu. 

Wiseman(fits well with PJ, and a different archetype of C to what we have with current roster; Okongwu way too similar physically to PJ, redundant) is the best fit out of the top 3, but many Draft Twitter people and Hornets fans aren’t happy with him. He, Ant and Melo are all kinda shit at basketball ATM tbh and all will be major negatives rookie year but Wiseman is the best fit and has the most realistic path to being a top 50 player IMO.

Not the hugest fan of Hayes. Not a bad pick, but not the best. Just unable to beat anyone off the dribble, I see him really struggling in the NBA as a primary ballhandler tbh. Would rather play Malik Monk at PG. In fact I think the 22 year old Monk still has more upside than anyone in this draft.

If we can get rid of Rozier and commit to playing Monk 30+ MPG I’ll basically be ok with whoever we pick, there are good reasons for basically anyone even Toppin(as much as I hope we avoid him)."
4646,2020-09-05 13:24:01,imug8k,"I agree I think this is a year to trade down, hopefully there are teams in that 7-10 range looking to move up. But Vassell, with miles Bridges, and pj Washington is pretty nice. And late lottery/teens I really like Tyrese Maxey. I like the Lowry comps, but maybe with less passing/court awareness. I just think he can definitely be one of the 5 guys on the floor for a team when it matters, and I’m not sure how many other players in that range I can see that. 

Oh maybe Cleveland at 6, similar deal to what I brought up take on love and swap 3 for 6 and pick up one of their young guards. And run love as small ball shooting center."
4647,2020-09-05 13:44:04,imug8k,"Yeah I like Maxey too but he’s a bit too similar to Monk. I think he’s a steal at where he’s been mocked recently though. To be honest I’m fine with even picking him if that’s the conclusion Kupchak comes to, though ideally we cash in on Devonte if we draft another small guard(the guys I mentioned for us all have at least potential to play some SF I feel.)"
4648,2020-09-05 13:48:34,imug8k,"Yeah he’s my guy in range of 21, I trade 34 or 36 or both to move up to 17. I love his off ball movement, he’s tenacious on both ends, strong, and just has a knack for big plays when it matters. 

Do you see monk in your longterm plans?  I loved him coming out of Kentucky, and still think he can contribute in the league, I know his size can limit his use or maybe adds additional challenges for roster construction."
4649,2020-09-05 13:53:45,imug8k,"I wrote a few deep dives on Monk lol but in short I’m really high on him to be honest, he improved some of his biggest question masks as a prospect(offball defense, ballhandling though it can still improve a lot, finishing at the rim, shot selection). We need to give him a proper leash now that he’s arguably our best team defender and see how far he can as a PnR ballhandler IMO, to really tap into his ceiling; but IMO the discourse around him is mostly inaccurate.

He was averaging 17 PPG in the 13 games before his suspension and was finally getting minutes even though Borrego still preferred Rozier(because Borrego is not a good coach) and added in with his passing and defense looked like our best player then. Had he not been suspended and the season shortened by COVID I tend to think the discourse around him would be much more positive.

His biggest issue now is shooting! Don’t think anyone would’ve predicted that coming out of college. Think he will figure it out; form and percentages improved as the season went on and as he adjusted to his now much stronger frame."
4650,2020-09-05 03:39:11,imu2wl,"I’m amazed at how fast the 2016 Sharks have been dismantled. Obviously they had some older guys (Heighington, Tagatese, Lewis, Ennis), guys who were sacked (Barba) and salary cap issues, but you’d still expect more than 3 to still be there. 

Outside of that, there aren’t really any surprises there."
4651,2020-09-05 03:55:12,imu2wl,">Pretty crazy that Boyd’s the only one that’s won it with the Broncos

We haven't won a comp in 14 years. If anything it's surprising any of them have won one with us"
4652,2020-09-05 03:42:32,imu2wl,That's actually not a lot of players overall. Shows you how dominant the Roosters and Storm have been lately.
4653,2020-09-05 03:27:26,imu2wl,"Bukuya retired earlier this year so 3.

The rest have been average this year, would be happier to have the entire Jets lineup from the last few seasons playing. So very close to that happening with some suspensions coming though...."
4654,2020-09-05 03:54:15,imu2wl,"Everytime Scott has made a booboo this year and my fellow Raiders have been frustrated, I've been swift to remind them the he is our most successful player lol"
4655,2020-09-05 03:26:21,imu2wl,Bukuya retired so he isn't at the Sharks anymore
4656,2020-09-05 05:34:01,imu2wl,Not sure that Merrin is the X factor
4657,2020-09-05 04:39:11,imu2wl,I'm amazed at the fact there are only 3 players remaining from the Sharks and Bunnies premiership teams.
4658,2020-09-05 05:00:00,imu2wl,Broncs haven’t won in 14 years. It’s not that surprising that Boyd’s the only one. It’s more surprising that anyone’s playing for the same team 14 years later.
4659,2020-09-05 07:15:58,imu2wl,"Fuck me this is a solid illustration of how utterly terrible our cap management is... Our only premiership winner who is actively taking the field is on less coin than a bunch of our overpaid players.  Even more painful, if they even do line up on game day, they play hardly any game time and usually put in fuck all effort"
4660,2020-09-05 04:42:21,imu2wl,Jake Granville and Darius Boyd are the best premiership winners
4661,2020-09-05 11:45:42,imu2wl,"16 for Roosters, Teddy isn't on the list."
4662,2020-09-05 06:28:49,imu2wl,"No, i do not count the Storm's premierships."
4663,2020-09-05 04:06:53,imu2wl,Not anymore. Luke played well the other night though
4664,2020-09-05 08:28:12,imu2wl,Maybe instead of a salary cap there should be a premiership winners cap
4665,2020-09-05 11:14:29,imu2wl,"TIL T-Rex still plays. I did not know that.

I feel like the most surprising for me is the sharks. Im surprised the squad has turned over that much since 2016. It my brain the sharks win wasnt that long ago"
4666,2020-09-05 06:03:11,imu2wl,Isn't Sia a premiership player also? With the Roosters?
4667,2020-09-05 08:08:20,imu2wl,As long as the roosters play the storm in the pre lim and one knocks the other one out I am happy. And by happy I mean the roosters beat Melbourne.
4668,2020-09-05 11:14:40,imu2wl,"Think that was my original comment, i thought about doing a comparison with other clubs but couldn't be bothered, thanks for putting the hard yards in! 

Hoping next year we can emulate Canberra 's 0 winners for a grand final appearance."
4669,2020-09-05 05:03:36,imu2wl,"With both McQueen and Benji gone next year, we will have a grand total of zero premiership winners unless we sign some in the off season."

4673,2020-09-05 03:55:27,imu2wl,You may not believe me because you're a Roosters fan and your club basically never lets go of a player unless they want them to leave but it's hard for teams to hold together a Premiership winning team.
4674,2020-09-05 08:02:37,imu2wl,Their youngest regulars that year were both 21 (Holmes/Bird) which is fairly old as far as your youngest players go. Side was mostly older/experienced guys.
4675,2020-09-05 12:26:03,imu2wl,"That sharks team did feel a little bit like a last chance saloon style super team, like a bunch of players that other teams were willing to take a risk on one last contract so they all went to Cronulla to win a ring."
4676,2020-09-05 04:28:40,imu2wl,Yeah nah just realised how dumb that sounded
4677,2020-09-05 11:21:05,imu2wl,Id be interested to see how many are still there from their 2015 gf appearance. Darry B is the only one that comes to mind but there must be others
4678,2020-09-05 03:51:56,imu2wl,"Yeah you’d get used to a little bit of turnover from grand final squads but the Roosters have only lost Cronk to retirement from their last 2 prems and Latrell and Tetevano this year. Before that it was Fergo, Matto and Napa.

4689,2020-09-05 04:13:37,imu2wl,"I know that the other 15 clubs tend to tear apart premiership winning rosters, but you would still expect it to take longer than that. 

There are still 8 2015 Cowboys at the club. 

At the start of last year, Souths still had 8 players from the 2014 GF at the club (Inglis, G. Burgess, S. Burgess*, Sutton and Turner in addition to the three still there.)

There are 5 Roosters from 2013 still at the club (plus SBW who has come back)

The 2012 Storm still have two players at the club. In 2016 (4 years after they won it) there were still 6 players there. 

4 years after Manly won in 2011, they had 7 players still at the club

So while premiership teams do get dismantled fairly quickly, it’s still surprising how quick the Sharks have been torn apart."

4713,2020-09-06 19:06:12,imqsvv,"Some things I think are not talked about enough are how much of China's rise is the expansion of Japan's rise and creation of an East Asian industrial sphere, expanded first to South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong and now to China vs. how much is the expansion of American globalization of low value added manufacturing for which China is merely the first Bangladesh or Ethiopia with some first-mover advantage but otherwise facing a race to the bottom. Though both paths eventually lead to crisis and the end of American hegemony, this matters because Japan's monopoly rivalry with the US already provoked world war once (and was largely responsible for Asian postcolonial socialism) and nearly provoked it again if not for Japan's political weakness in the 80s when it faced a similar situation to China today although it had many more monopoly competitors to the US. China seems different because it has the political will and potential internal market to succeed where Japan and SK could not even if this is still distant from the present. Even though Japan never had a chance to defeat the US it still fundamentally changed the world merely by forwarding an idea of Asia for Asians as a facade for its own imperialism. Imagine if Africa took Chinese socialism seriously under revolutionary conditions. 

Also it's true there are currently hard limits on what China can do in inter-imperialist competition but we can't forget the sloughing of low profit manufacturing is treading water on a sinking ship. For all its R&D, first world profits have remained low except for finance and tech. That's expected from King's thesis but he doesn't talk about whether this is sufficient to sustain a national labor aristocracy and what innovations are even possible anymore. Short of fantasies of AI, part of the crisis today is that less and less real innovation is possible in tech and we may be facing the end of an entire tech epoch with the end of Moore's law. Much of the profitability data is limited by inability to measure value transfers from the third world but global stagnation for a decade shows if American imperialism is to renew itself there is a lot of pain to come which has been until now avoided. Regardless of one's characterization of China, remember that everywhere Japan went in East Asia socialism followed and the same is true of Germany in Eastern Europe. The existence of China can only be a good thing for the prospects of socialism, for the first time we can talk about entire regions and ""worlds.""

Finally, we can't overestimate the ability of the US to stop other capitalists from abandoning the sinking ship. Just like Britain before it, the US dollar system gives it far more influence globally than its actual national economic power. Other countries are subsidizing the American empire and that cannot last forever, especially when it even costs American companies to go along with the US state department. I don't expect this system to go peacefully but the mere existence of China gives Germany and Japan room to maneuver (a good reference here are the possibilities for inter-imperialist competition vis-a-vis the USSR, particularly Italian revolutionary politics in relation to its position in the world system, a connection not usually made even though the Red Brigades were very interested in ""neo-Guallism"" and the political forms of what would become neoliberalism). So far Germany has remained the last bastion of political neoliberalism though that will die with Merkel. Japan just saw the neoliberal fascist Abe resign, in the short term to be replaced by a lesser known fascist but in the long term the only solution for Japan and Germany is inter-imperialist struggle rather then domestic repression. Luckily for the left, fascism in the 21st century has been a tool to preserve neoliberalism and the US hegemonic system, whoever claims the mantel of the interests of the nationalist bourgeoisie won't be these lame fascists. This is a contradiction every country faces, see the political white supremacy of Australia and Canada against its own economic dependence on Japanese created raw material export networks that now flow through China or the former Asian Tigers where politics and economics are rupturing completely (see South Korea where a comprador political regime opposed an economy totally dependent on China and increasingly hostile to American protectionism or Hong Kong where a dying labor aristocracy is hostile to China while a bourgeois political regime represents the interest of global capital). These are very different problems than the era of decolonization but they can still be mapped onto the world and understood for political strategy. 

Global communism was avoided in the last revolutionary epoch because rather than the US and Britain fighting for global hegemony (as happened during the entire epoch of Anglo-Dutch wars and absolutist nonstop war that created the possibility of industrial capitalism and the modern era) Germany and Britain destroyed each other and the US emerged from the ashes of both without the USSR ever rising to challenge it. That's not going to happen this time, China and the US are headed for direct confrontation in the next couple of decades. The most important task for Americans then is anti-imperialism, anti-racism, and doing whatever we can to prevent a war with China for as long as possible and turn it into a revolutionary civil war as soon as possible, if nothing else so that humanity itself is not wiped out by American stubbornness and defense of its pivilege. It shouldn't need to be said to communists but if that is the primary contradiction, it fundamentally changes political strategy in a way that is rarely discussed when socialism is seen as part of the old questions of social democracy."

4715,2020-09-06 21:36:20,imqsvv,"Wasn't aware of King, this seems like a really interesting thesis!"
4716,2021-01-08 23:53:18,imqsvv,"I placed this in an edit in the OP, but I want to comment it too. I know that I am missing information that I could include, but I will save their inclusion for next post, which I will save for a few weeks until Biden and co. step in (we should see what their approach will be).

""Nonetheless, I will provide a few short summarizing updates:

- COMAC and Chinese aerospace industry were predictably sanctioned, as were SMIC and chip industry (but I already commented about that) and an attempt was made on WeChat. There is undoubtedly more I could put here as plenty was sanctioned in favour of existing monopoly and Pompeo's ""clean network"" etc, but I will save that for next post.

- Smoke's comment had some important points that we can now reflect on: Trump's America has *not* succeeded in the trade war against China, and contrary to public racism many MNCs still enjoy accessing the Chinese market and labour pool (we'll see what Biden attempts in this regard). It's true that we have seen a lot of decay at home, but viewing this economically, no matter how racist people are, capital will flow where there is profit to be made. One great example that I could have gone into further depth on is EV tech (in the automotive section); Buffet obviously invested in BYD, but in addition to this Tesla has a factory in Shanghai that will provide for much of their market as well (and deeper ties and deals with Chinese firms), and Chinese EV battery manufacturers have large market share (not to mention the Chinese EV market will be huge). This isn't *exactly* all domestic industry like CRRC, but can Chinese EV MNCs leapfrog the current automotive consensus in R&D as their high speed trains have? Will the current automotive monopolies (& Tesla) attempt any tech takeovers via political/economic warfare, or are we looking at a ""comprador"" future? The automotive industry will be a key area to watch I believe.

- Further ruminations on their comment: China and the EU have signed a large trade deal recently, and undoubtedly the development of the intercontinental ""Silk Road"" railway had something to do with this; over the last few years Europe has been catching up in trade balance - sending a lot of commodities to China via this route. Ties between economies underlie ties between political relations, so I will save any predictions about China's ability to beat the American trade war until my next post; obviously Europe provides additional maneuverability, and Japan/South Korea simply cannot slough off China so easily (neither can the USA apparently!). 

That's probably enough for now, so I'll save any future writing for next post, which perhaps can come in February or March. I hope to do more research into wider Chinese industry by then (as well as regional and global political economic areas and their implications for future conflict), and I would greatly appreciate any collaboration for that post."
4717,2020-10-23 12:52:46,imqsvv,"Sorry for the late response. I have a rather general question on Kings thesis. 

Following Lenins work King assumes that the exploitation of oppressed nations happens through the monopolization of the highest labor productivity in the imperialist countries. 

As i unsterstand it stands in contrast to Cope's ""Divided world, divided class"" which assumes equal productivity throughout the world.

Following Cope's argument one might come to the conclusion that first world workers are actually net-exploiters (in light of the huge wage difference between first and third world).

But after reading King the explanation of this presents itself differently: The first world has a higher quality labor process. A higher quality labor process requires a higher quality workforce. This means a higher degree of cultural and social developement of the first world workforce.

This would explain the difference between living standards of first and third world workers whithout having to assume that basically the entire imperialist workforce is a labor aristocracy.

Am I missing something here? Isn't this kind of a refutation of the third-worldist position Cope puts forward?"
4718,2020-09-06 20:59:10,imqsvv,"Completely agree, King's thesis is complementary but a sliver of a wider picture; an understanding which is further fed by the work of Li and many others. King describes imperialism's self-perpetuating mechanism and sees the limits for China but does not really seek to analyze the ceiling that imperialist powers themselves will try to avoid hitting. So while we can predict areas of future conflict there are ""3rd variables"" to consider which are not evident in King; accelerating ecological crisis (here I include COVID; something the USA is flailing about to contain), the limits of innovation/profit and other issues endemic in capitalism which will cause ""trouble at home""; and as you mention there is no guarantee of which sides any country would take in the coming crisis (inter-imperialist rivalry and where profit is made).

So King is more of a scientific grounding where there has been deviation/misunderstanding on the subject of ""China's rise"", but not the be-all-end-all. Sure China's rise is precarious but doubly so is global capitalism's reliance on it if we are to take Li's claim of China's centrality seriously. Further, King does not consider the world's workers and thus cannot speak to the ruptures you mention. How will the world's proletariat react to a massive crisis? In countries with such a strong socialist legacy, such as China, we should not be so worried; our work is at home, where unrest can be directed constructively."
4719,2020-09-19 00:58:52,imqsvv,"Sorry to revive this after two weeks as your brain is likely elsewhere now, but do you have any recommended readings/literature that speak to the main threads of your comment? Any direction you can point me in? 

I can narrow my request down; King ends his thesis by recommending a course of action for future research by saying:

> A possible
approach to this would be work that focuses on the question of industrialisation, specifically
examining the character of manufacturing in Third World countries against the types of labour
processes that imperialist firms and states are increasingly specialising in.

To this you have said that innovation has a limit and the technological advancements of first world nations - hence their ability to perpetuate monopoly - are reaching an end as profits fall etc. I agree with this and I do understand what you're getting at *to an extent* and so I want to deepen this understanding.

Also if you have any recommendations for understanding the ""East Asian Industrial Sphere"" you refer to as I am very interested in this.

Or if there is something else you would recommend I'd be happy to read it. Thanks in advance."
4720,2020-10-23 17:31:31,imqsvv,"First I'll answer how King specifically differentiates himself from Cope, and then I will answer your question about the labour aristocracy.

**The Difference**

King helps answer how first world firms can exploit third world labourers to the extent that they do *and* how they are able to maintain this exploitation (ie their positions of power over third world industry). King specifically writes about Cope on page 74 so I would direct you there for a reading (but I will be pulling from that section anyway).

The fact that labour productivity is equal for many industries *is the reason why* those industries are moved to third world nations where the labour can be exploited more while the same amount of product can be produced (ie clothing). But King argues that productivity is not equal across every sector (thus not equal in general) and this is because first world firms dump huge amounts of capital into R&D to maintain their monopolistic advantage over higher-productivity levels of labour. Thus the more ""technological"" processes *which both Cope and King talk about* are concentrated in the imperialist core by design (Cope only makes brief mention of a technological advantage, however, and focuses on converging productivity).

Cope argues that large amounts of surplus value is produced and then transferred through profit equalization; whereas capital flows into the global south where profit is higher, thus flooding that branch and driving down the cost of goods (and thus wages) until profit equalizes. Cope says:

> since the incredibly low wages of Third World nations do not result in a concomitantly high rate of profit [for the capital employing this labour power - principally Southern firms -SK], international differences in wages are principally observed in prices.

King says:

> The first problem is that Southern-produced cheap labour goods have both high and low prices. Compare the iPhone to the $10 pair of jeans. If both these are assumed to contain mostly cheap labour, what explains their radical price divergence? Secondly, profit rates are not equal. What Lauesen and Cope seek to explain is not equal profits but core surplus-profits. If, as Cope says, productivity is now equal, and it is Southern capital that has best access to cheap labour, why can't it be the principal beneficiary? Thirdly, as Mandel (1972) pointed out in relation to the theory as originally articulated by Emmanuel and Amin, for their theory to work, capital would have to be constantly flowing into the South. Such capital outflow from the core would be a massive capital flight. Yet capital continues to concentrate in the core, not decamp en masse. Lastly, why should it be the case, assuming equal productivity and massive capital flight, that
Third World wages would remain lower than the core—permanently? To this contention, Cope relies again on Amin's response ""the market price of labor capacity [i.e. labour power—SK] varies because of class struggle"" and the ""indelibly political nature of economics"".

> As seen, Lauesen and Cope's ""global prices of production"" explanation of value transfer relies on the assumption of equalisation of profit rates. Yet profit rates are not equal. In order to explain imperialist super-profits, the authors revert in practice to the concept of monopoly. As they believe the core has lost its dominance in the labour process they naturally conceive of monopoly as also outside the labour process. We are told: 

> > Through its domination of world trade..., finance, investment, military goods, energy sources and exchange rates, [i.e. everything except production] the monopoly capital of the imperialist countries ensures that it need not compete with the producers of the Global South and is, therefore, under no compulsion to lower domestic input costs accordingly. (Cope)

> Like other ""financialisation"" explanations, Cope does not explain how ""finance"", ""investment"" or ""exchange rates"" can bring about core monopoly domination in the absence of its productive domination. ""Domination of world trade"" on the other hand, clearly relies, in the long run, on what one has to trade. According to Cope, technology transfer is blocked not by any organic economic mechanism within the imperialist economy but only outside of the economy due to political intervention—""protectionism"". Elsewhere, we are told the core monopolises ""intellectual property""—i.e. a legal title—as opposed to the ability to produce new technology and apply it to the production process, is what guards imperialist
profit. In this context, we get a non-economic definition of imperialism, which becomes ""the military and political effort on the part of the wealthy capitalist countries to siphon and extort surplus value"".

**Labour Aristocracy**

*This does not refute the labour aristocracy*. Cope's work isn't wrong, his empirical evidence is good, he just wasn't able to explain the causes for imperialism well enough. The massive surplus value that first world monopolies are able to extract from the third world are still pieced out; some amount goes to the government (then putting that money towards roads, hospitals etc), some goes to maintaining the high wages of ""redundant"" jobs (ie: managers etc who work in the firm's imperialist core), and as King adds, a significant amount of that surplus value is poured into the R&D of each firm in order to maintain a monopolistic advantage and perpetuate this exploitation (thus the ""brains"" are also concentrated in the imperialist core *because that's where the scientific capital flows*). There is more to say here but I think it's probably better to just re-read King's thesis so you can see how he isn't disagreeing with Smith/Cope etc but strengthening the understanding of imperialism.

In short: massive amounts of surplus value flow from the global south to the global north (and a good chunk of the population gets a good chunk of this value); this has been shown empirically. King shows why exploitation occurs at the extent that it does, and how it has been able to continue (ie how the gap between global north and south has not closed but probably actually widened). 

Does that answer your questions?"
4721,2020-09-19 18:12:30,imqsvv,"I'm sure you've read all the good ones so I'll give you some mediocre recommendations which have interesting parts:

You might know Gary Gereffi and ""global value chain analysis"" since John Smith discusses it in his book but there's a decent center for it which has good empirical work

https://gvcc.duke.edu/cggcproject/asia/

There's a good series on Korea. Also you might know Arrighi's work but there's a good work on steel, coal, and iron ore in the rise of Japan and China 

https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/east-asia-and-global-economy (all books can be found online)

The theory is nonsense but the empirical analysis is interesting, especially because it brings in Australia, South Africa, Brazil, and Canada into what is usually an America-Japan-China story.

Also you might already know Chalmers Johnson,Alice Amsden and Robert Wade as the East Asian ""developmental state"" people but there are two books I enjoy that are less known. One is 

https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9780312160562

Which brings Japan and Korea together (and by extension China on a much larger scale). The other is pure business literature and apologia for Korean nationalism but has some good information about the rise of Samsung which tells us a lot about Huawei

https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/tiger-technology/F03E7206B5333C361AE4DBDC0F8BC851

Sorry that these are mostly about Korea and Japan and none are Marxist. Some of that is my specialization is Korea and Japan, everything I read on China is for myself. Some of that is political, I honestly don't know of any good books on China, they are either ""Marxist"" works that interview random Chinese workers and how miserable they are or American bourgeois sociology that is nothing but junk theory about ""authoritarian capitalism"" or whatever. China does not have a national academic industry like Japan and Korea and what does exist is in Hong Kong and therefore is warped by politics. Of course there are good Marxist works but we already know them and by virtue of being Marxist they have to gloss over empirical specificities to talk about the totality, at least if the goal is to get under 500 pages.

E: I'm welcome to any recommendations you have as well, there's a lot in your OP about specific industries I didn't know and would like to learn more about."
4722,2020-10-23 17:47:30,imqsvv,"Yes. This clarifies things.
I was aware that it doesn't refute the labor aristocray. But the problem I had is if this labor aristocracy today is almost the entire first world workforce (one could argue that even the poorest first world worker earns more than most people in the third world) or if part of the wage differential can be explained because of the different values of labor power in different countries."
4723,2020-09-21 21:41:26,imqsvv,"This is good thank you! It will keep me busy; on a related note I've also recently been picking up Intan Suwandi's [work](https://monthlyreview.org/product/value-chains/) - she focuses on unit labour costs and global value chains (heavy world systems influence) so perhaps it will be complementary to a few of these recommendations (I haven't bought the book but I've skimmed over some of her previous work).

> Sorry that these are mostly about Korea and Japan and none are Marxist.

No problem, these are blind spots for me; they will be valuable. I especially want to understand the economic histories and possibilities of the East-Asian industrial sphere so I might better understand China's regional positioning.

> I'm welcome to any recommendations you have as well, there's a lot in your OP about specific industries I didn't know and would like to learn more about.

A close reading of King/Lenin really illuminated my own knowledge of Chinese industry and I was intrigued to research further. So this was more my broad research on the individual histories of different areas of Chinese tech while I had Marx/Lenin/King to fall back on, and unfortunately I don't have any unified literature (no real books or articles at all other than King, who scatters a few cited examples) to point to. If I do come across any I will be sure to share them, but for now all I can really do is suggest a reading of individual Chinese industries.

I did leave out some industries that I could have covered, though. One such industry was high-speed rail (or simply rail) and this (CRRC being the state-owned manufacturer) is actually an area China excels in today; bidding on international projects and actually competing with traditional monopolies in several markets. Previous 和谐号 (he xie hao/""harmony"") rolling stock/locomotives were the product of foreign technology transfer (Bombardier, Alstom, Siemens, Kawasaki) but the new 复兴号 (fu xing hao/""rejuvenation"") rolling stock/locomotives are fully Chinese-designed (CRRC owns the IP rights etc). Of course even though the CRRC can, for example, bid on projects like the California HSR project, that doesn't mean they will get it (and indeed competitive Chinese tech will not be welcome in the USA anytime soon unless it's partially foreign-owned like BYD; a supplier of electric buses to Cali). 

>  I honestly don't know of any good books on China, they are either ""Marxist"" works that interview random Chinese workers and how miserable they are or American bourgeois sociology that is nothing but junk theory about ""authoritarian capitalism"" or whatever

This is the quite unfortunate part. Another interest of mine is the Chinese intellectual sphere and understanding the rise of the organic ""New Left"" in China and how they interact(ed) with their liberal counterparts. As New Left is such a broad term term for covering the intellectuals who were a) opposed to market reform and b) conceptualizing post-reform modernity, most of their work is only good for understanding *the arena of ideas itself* and not China's post-reform economy (Minqi Li being the exception that we all know of). 

Although perhaps I can point you in a productive direction if you haven't yet looked at the following: Li did co-author a Chinese language (published by Renmin University Press) economics textbook (资本的终结 - ""The End of Capital"") with a few similar economists (Zhang Yaozu, Zhu Xun, Qi Hao) although I am not fluent enough in Chinese to successfully read it. The 3 co-authors (among others in the Amherst/Renmin uni tradition), are a more valuable read than the broad ""New Left"" and you can find (fairly recent) English work by Zhu, Qi and similar new economists like Ying Chen and Li Zhongjin ([for example 1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0486613412475183), [2](https://www.peri.umass.edu/economists/zhongjin123/item/1060-giovanni-arrighi-in-beijing-rethinking-the-transformation-of-the-labor-supply-in-rural-china-during-the-reform-era), and there are many more). So I would recommend looking at Chinese economists who have graduated from/work at Amherst/Renmin and then stacking up material from there; while work from the Renmin publishing house is all in Chinese (it's ""中国人民大学出版社"" if you want to look for it), many Amherst/Renmin graduates collaborate and publish in English (there is a decent amount of authors/material; mainly of this past decade which suggests that the intellectual movement is growing; it's definitely something to follow I'd say)."
4724,2020-09-21 23:02:19,imqsvv,"Those are good recommendations, thanks. I also should have mentioned the actual Marxist works on Korea:

Dae oup-Chang's *Capitalist Development in Korea: Labour, Capital and the Myth of the Developmental State* and

*Marxist Perspectives on South Korea in the Global Economy* edited by Seongjin Jeong. That comes from a whole Marxist economics department at Gyeongsang National University, haven't check on them in a while but I'm sure they have some good stuff.

Usually the award never goes to him for obvious reasons, but he put himself back in the mix for it in an off-season that spells disaster for NE short term with Brady leaving. 

If Newton works out and this offense is competent, and BB leads another great defense, then it’s hard to imagine them missing the playoffs and BB not winning the award."

4731,2020-09-09 08:08:47,imft75,"[Here are my 2019 NFL Season Predictions.](https://old.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/cyhgj0/only_4_days_till_football_starts_lets_hear/eys35kj/?context=3) - To be honest, not too shabby! I went 5/8 on division winners(picked Titans to win div over Houston, missed badly on Carolina > New Orleans, and expecting SF to be bad). Called 100% the Chargers/Bears regression, Browns being overrated af, and I had the Chiefs in the SB!.... but I had them losing to Seattle and Russ winning MVP? I'm off the 

**Here are my 2020 NFL Season Predictions.**

**AFC East:**

* **Bills: 10-6**, yea yea I still believe Josh Allen is a bad QB and he'll lead them nowhere ala Blake Bortles but good support
* **Patriots: 9-7,** they're not gonna dominate, they'll make the wildcard round, maybe win it, but no further... NO TANKING
* Dolphins: 7-9, maybe a surprise? I wouldn't be shocked to go 9-7. I don't expect us to be bad. Fitzpatrick another good year
* Jets: 3-13, Gase is gonna get fired, Darnold is gonna be HARD on the rocks, maybe they'll go 6-10 and ruin shot at high pick

**AFC North:**

* **Ravens: 12-4,** there will be a point this season where people will say - ""are the Ravens good?"", they are guys
* **Steelers: 11-5,** I don't expect Big Ben to have a great comeback year, average QB, but that defense is monstorus
* Browns: 6-10, keep hyping up the Browns people, seriously, they're still going no where, trade Odell talk
* Bengals: 4-12, I predict Burrow will beat the Chargers Week #1, besides that, just another down year cuz HC sucks

**AFC South:**

* **Texans: 10-6,** sadly even though we have the Texans pick, I love Watson, be surprised if they didn't make playoffs
* Titans: 9-7, aren't they supposed to perennially be 9-7? I see them doing even worse potentially, letdown from AFCCG
* Colts: 7-9, Phillip Rivers isn't very good anymore, they'll be vying for the 7th playoff spot all season, fall short
* Jaguars: 2-14, I don't see anybody crush them like they crushed the Dolphins for tanking... no 0-16 cuz too difficult

**AFC West:**

* **Chiefs: 13-3,** I fully expect them to **REPEAT** as Super Bowl Champions. I know, easy pick, but I envy their team
* **Raiders: 10-6,** my sleeper pick!!! Yes, I had them as sleepers last year, but who cares! GRUDEN, GET IT DONE
* Broncos: 7-9, I don't really like Drew Lock, they have a decent roster, but they continue to wallow in mediocrity
* Chargers: 3-13, my surprise pick to be awful! They'll lose a bunch of one possession games like they always do, HC fired

**NFC East:**

* **Cowboys: 12-4**, sadly they finally live up to the hype - I could see them even making the NFCCG for 1st time in forever
* Eagles: 8-8, I think they're just due for a letdown season, they saved it last year after losing to us - but yea
* Washington: 5-11, I'm lukewarm on Haskins, in general they're in a transition year with Rivera, decent signs of growth
* Giants: 5-11, I don't believe Daniel Jones is a very good QB - people will be frustrated by him but blame everything else

**NFC North:** 

* **Packers: 11-5**, I don't care much for the Packers team this year, but continuity with Rodgers will win another division title
* **Lions: 9-7,** PUT **MONEY** ON IT! THE LIONS ARE MAKING THE PLAYOFFS! PATRICIA IS A GARBAGE HC BUT STAFFORD
* Bears: 8-8, I told y'all about Trubisky, a good defense being hold back by QB... Foles plays for a lil and thrills but flails 
* Vikings: 6-10, your biggest disappointment of a playoff team from last year! Kirk Cousins is gonna be our piñata everybody

**NFC South:**

* **Falcons: 12-4,** DIRTY BIRDS REDEMPTION TOUR - y'all have slept on Ryan/Gurley/Julio/Ridley, invested in O-line, love 'em!
* **Buccaneers: 10-6,** they're gonna be... decent. Not SB Contenders. Not Dream Team. Just.. okay. Divisional Round Exit. Brady(further) decline
* Saints: 7-9, Drew Brees career ends with a dud... yes I bet against him last year, but look what happened vs Minnesota! It's over!
* Panthers: 4-12, sorry Panthers fans - I genuinely like Teddy and everything but I think it's another year of rebuilding

**NFC West:**

* **Seahawks: 14-2,** My appreciation for Russ Wilson is undying. Pete Carroll always wins a playoff game. Russ wins MVP this year!
* **49ers: 11-5,** good, but not as good as last year, people will fool themselves into liking Jimmy G again, he's still not all that
* Rams: 9-7, I think this means back-to-back years they miss the playoffs at 9-7 even with the expanded playoff? Sorry Goff
* Cardinals: 6-10, some decent progress with Murray and Hopkins but still another year away from being a year away

**Super Bowl LV:** Kansas City Chiefs 37 - Seattle Seahawks 33 (Russell Wilson wins MVP, Patrick Mahomes wins 2nd Super Bowl MVP)

and now that I'm looking back through this - I've realized the records may not even add up. That's okay. Who even knows if all these teams will end up playing 16 games. I feel like you can pick any bad team last year to go 9-7 and sneak into the wildcard and justify it. I've also realized I have the AFC South all finishing with EXACT same records they finished with last year. That sure as hell ain't happening lmao. Oh well, these are my gut check picks and I'm sticking with them!"

4736,2020-09-04 14:53:47,imft75,"Let's imagine some scenarios that are out there, but not completely insane:

- MVP = **Matt Ryan** - aided by DQ not fucking up for once, Ryan leads the Falcons to a shock NFC South title, throwing for 40+ TDs, 4500+ yards, and less than 10 Ints
- OPOY = **Julio Jones** - It's an MVP/OPOY double for Atlanta. Julio finally gets the TDs his consistently great performances deserve, leading the league
- DPOY = **Bradley Chubb** - His sophomore year was curtailed by injury, but this year he's back with a vengeance. Helped in no small part by having a future HOFer alongside him. 17+ Sacks and 3+ Ints hand Chubb the DPOY.
- OROY = **Chase Claypool** - Cementing himself as a starter almost immediately, Claypool quickly builds a rapport with Big Ben. He ends the season as the only 1000+ yard rookie WR.
- DROY = **Javon Kinlaw** - As with Bosa last year, Kinlaw slots straight into one of the strongest defences in the league. Kinlaw's rookie season isn't quite as good, but with Chase Young flattering to deceive, the floor is left open for the 49ers to go back-to-back.
- CPOTY = **Bradley Chubb** - I mentioned earlier that he missed a lot of 2019, so if he wins DPOY it would take an Alex Smith shaped miracle to prevent him winning this one too
- COTY = **Kevin Stefanski** - A very tight battle, Stefanski only wins Coach of the year by a couple of votes. Given my other predictions you'd probably expect Dan Quinn to make it a hattrick for the Falcons, but in this scenario Stefanski leads the Browns to only their second playoff appearance since reintroduction, and a first ever AFC North title (last time they won it was still the AFC Central)"
4737,2020-09-04 14:16:11,imft75,"MVP : Dak Prescott. Very good last year, bringing in McCarthy is a big upgrade over Garrett. 3 WR sets with Lamb are going to be near impossible to stop

OPOY : CMC. No explanation needed, dude is a generational talent

DPOY : TJ Watt. Somehow underrated. Steelers will likely be pretty good. Those god damn Watts have no chill

OROY : Joe Burrow. QB with a lot of weapons, very high ceiling from day 1. Don't expect them to win all that much but Burrow should ball

DROY : Patrick Queen. Him and Chase Young will both be monsters but I give the edge to the guy on an elite team

Comeback POY : Matt Stafford. Dude is a beast and would've been in the MVP conversation last year had he been healthy

Teddy likes shorts to intermediate throws. He's good and very accurate in that area. I expect McCaffrey to keep producing."
4743,2020-09-04 13:36:34,imft75,"This is a really good write up. Personally, I’m swapping Kyler and Dak on OPOY and MVP. I think Kyler takes his game to the next level. I think they make playoffs and he balls out. Dak will throw more than he maybe ever has, but I don’t think it’s enough for him to win it. 

Secondly, man I may be a homer, but TJ Watt will be a contender for DPOY. I expect an easy 17.5+ sack season, and he’s also always good for some fumbles and picks"
4744,2020-09-04 13:51:07,imft75,"I really think Keanu Neal could end up in the running for comeback player of the year.

He is the hardest hitting safety in the league, no doubt. He is the joint leader for safeties in FF since 2016 with 8FF. Malcolm Jenkins also has 8. Jenkins has 64 games, Keanu has 34. And both of his past two injuries have been non-contact, season-ending injuries. If he can remain healthy, he can definitely be in contention.

FF for safeties since 2016 -

T-1 - Keanu Neal - 8 Forced Fumbles - 34 Games - 0.24 per game

T-1 - Malcolm Jenkins - 8 Forced Fumbles - 0.13 per game

3 - Vonn Bell - 7 Forced Fumbles - 61 games - 0.11 per game

4 - Jamal Adams - 6 Forced Fumbles - 46 Games - 0.13 per game

4747,2021-01-19 07:14:12,imft75,Oof nope.
4748,2020-09-04 14:19:54,imft75,Tompa Bay is stacked. TB12 is getting the MVP. Pats are winning the superbowl behind a still great defense and a resurgent Cam Newton. Belichick is actually eligible for COTY this year so he wins that. This entire sub dies of a sodium overdose.
4749,2020-09-04 17:22:55,imft75,"Well, he will probably be in the conversation, but it is the worst situation he has been in over the last few years, with a team that won't be ahead too much in my opinion and no other capable pass-rushers next to him."
4750,2020-09-04 17:28:23,imft75,"If they win the East somehow, for sure. If it's the 7th seed, than he might not quite get the votes, since those usually go to the coaches of the teams with the best records."
4751,2020-09-04 14:52:42,imft75,That would be Rivers' second CPOY without ever missing a start! Was actually hoping for Derwin but that will have to wait until next year
4752,2020-09-04 17:35:19,imft75,"I like Jefferson a lot. He can't replace Diggs right away, but I think with the rest of the WRs on that Minnesota roster, he can produce pretty effectively.

The two LBs are fun with splash-plays and their range, but those guys rarely get the recognition they deserve. Usually it's more about pass-rushers and those guys high in takeaways."
4753,2020-09-14 10:23:13,imft75,"Your predictions for the Colts and Saints are shocking to me, but I like the majority of this. Nice work!"

4756,2020-09-04 17:37:50,imft75,If the Bills go 11-5 and he throws 30 TDs in a more efficient way? That'll get him some votes.

4758,2020-09-04 17:42:52,imft75,"I'm not really against any of those, other than Claypool. He could certainly be a beast in the red-zone and make some big plays, but too many mouths to feed in Pittsburgh for me.
Chubb I like a lot. He looked amazing the few reps we saw from last preseason against the starters. Kinlaw makes a lot of sense too, as part of that ferocious front-four."

4763,2020-09-04 17:24:37,imft75,"I like those! As far as the Bucs receivers go, I think Godwin will see more targets, but Tre White could easily be in that conversation on defense.

Not totally sure about the Patriots and BB however. That's one I still have to see."

But yeah, those can all be candidates for sure."
4767,2020-09-05 01:39:11,imft75,"Burrow only needs to have decent season to get OROY since the awards are QB favored. Dobbins is a RB2 and I just don't see a RB2 winning OROY unless you think he's going to take the job away from Ingram but even if that happens, it wouldn't be until mid or later in the season which means Dobbins would lack the volume stats needed to help his case for OROY."
4768,2020-09-04 17:36:54,imft75,"Yeah, but 120 catches - mostly on checkdowns - that don't win you games, won't bring him votes. But yeah, of course he could be in the discussion."
4769,2020-09-04 13:40:46,imft75,I will be shocked if he puts up 17.5 sacks. The dude is a monster but I don't see him as a guy who puts up those huge sack totals because we see him in coverage a fair amount as well
4770,2020-09-04 17:30:32,imft75,"Thanks man!
Yeah, I definitely like Kyler, but at 9-7, I don't think he'll quite get those votes.
Very specific on the sack total, but yeah T.J. can fill the stat sheet for sure!"
4771,2020-09-04 13:57:22,imft75,"Dude, he needs to stay on the field first lol. I’m a Falcons fan also and I love Neal, but his FFs don’t mean shit if he hasn’t had one in over 2 years due to season-ending injuries. Hope he stays healthy this season or he’s gone in
2021."
4772,2020-09-04 17:25:57,imft75,"That's an interesting choice. When healthy, he is that Kam Chancellor-type player for the Falcons, but we have rarely seen Neal be able to stay healthy."
4773,2020-09-04 16:07:24,imft75,Raiders offense have crazy potential... All comes down to the young WR core
4774,2020-09-04 17:38:45,imft75,"Some bold picks, but I like quite a few of them!"
4775,2021-01-20 19:31:16,imft75,"Always love when someone goes back a full season and talks about what was wrong about a list. Btw. Mahomes will be 2nd in MVP voting plus I was maybe the only person on the internet to say Josh Allen will be an MVP candidate, Myles Garrett was arguably the favorite to DPOY, Chase Young will win DROY, Big Ben might finish behind only Alex Smith (who nobody thought would play) in CPOY and two of my Coach of the Year candidates were #2 seeds. Saquon & CEH got hurt. So not what's ""oof"" about that."

4778,2020-09-04 17:52:57,imft75,That’s not realistic though
4779,2020-09-04 15:56:27,imft75,"Yeah, he seems like a little shit"
4780,2020-09-04 14:50:26,imft75,He’s certainly positioned to with those baller ass pass catchers he’s got in a vertical system.
4781,2020-09-04 17:39:16,imft75,"Steelers fan actually, and I hate thinking the Ravens are as good and as hungry as I fear they will be."
4782,2020-09-05 09:41:02,imft75,I think he outplays Ingram and takes the job early.
4783,2020-09-04 17:43:29,imft75,You put Saquon. So....
4784,2020-09-04 13:44:25,imft75,"Even tho we use him all over the field, he recorded 14.5. I think as our secondary gets better, and our linebackers get better as pass coverage we’ll get to unleash him more often. It might be wishful thinking, but if our overall defense improves, TJ Watt will become a monster"
4785,2020-09-04 14:05:51,imft75,"That's the point of comeback player of the year though...

If he stays healthy and returns to his previous form, he could definitely be in contention."
4786,2020-09-04 18:42:34,imft75,2. Chung and Hightower. PFF has us ranked at 4 going into the year.
4787,2020-09-04 23:11:52,imft75,The Bills were 10-6 last season and certainly improved this offseason. And Josh was responsible for 29 touchdowns without a true number one receiver like Diggs. So I think it is actually very realtistic that he takes another step in his development.
4788,2020-09-04 15:56:49,imft75,Backfield on point too
4789,2020-09-04 23:08:52,imft75,"Haha, yeah they are just so complete and have only gotten better this offseason!"
4790,2020-09-04 23:08:18,imft75,"Yes, in a New England-like run-centric offense behind an improving O-line, instead of a wide open attack Joe Brady took with him from LSU.

And I have the Giants winning twice as many games at least, even if it isn't very many either way."
4791,2020-09-04 14:03:27,imft75,"Oh TJ is already a monster, but we also have a stupidly good d line. If it was just him out there as well I could see it, but he will be racing Heyward, tuitt and Dupree back there for sacks most of the time too"
4792,2020-09-04 16:16:12,imft75,"We’ll see! I’m not even remotely a Fournette believer, but the camp hype on RoJo is definitely real!"

4813,2020-09-03 17:20:33,ilxboo,"Not sure to what degree he's taking fit into account, but this is a solid mock imo. For example, idk why the Sixers would take Srubb after grabbing Hampton/Terry/Flynn/Joe (I like those first 4 picks though).

Agreed on LaMelo at 1 I don't think Edwards is as seamless of a fit as people are portraying it.

Also love seeing Jessup in the top 60. He's an interesting ""pre-stash"" guy and one of the best shooters in the class."
4814,2020-09-03 18:35:07,ilxboo,"Loving that this projection has The Spurs 2nd pick at #41 as  Udoka Azubuike.    Been hyped on this possibility for some time now.    If it happens, imagine Udoka being mentored by Timmy."

Another week it’s Anthony Edwards. One week they like James Wiseman. Another week they like Onyeka Okongwu more than Wiseman. I think there is some truth to some of the stuff being thrown out there, but that front office does tend to be very talkative, and the Warriors know what they are doing when they talk to reporters. The front office started the smoke screen process earlier than anyone else this year, using its willingness to engage with reporters to its advantage.

This has been my thought from the start. The warriors had zero incentive to tip off reporters about what direction they are leaning, but people were taking these rumors as gospel. 

Trading back and getting Okongwu, Deni, Okoro, Vassell...etc always made the most sense to me. Ball and Edwards have a lot of upside, but Curry is in his prime and they dont have a lot of time to waste by waiting around for kids to develop."

But the Celtics have so many things to be settled before the draft (I assume they will have a very good idea on opt-ins even if that deadline remains a day after the draft), and flexibility with three picks, that it is tough to project. If draft and stash is a big part of their strategy, seems like using the second-rounder on Yam Madar or Filip Petrusev might be a better fit."

4847,2020-09-04 08:25:25,ilxboo,"Can somebody explain to me why mock drafts keep assigning Maxey to the Mavs at 18?

I don't get the fit next to Luka -- he'll kill the spacing (unless that 3PT% stats dont tell the whole story), he doesn't seem to have the size/athleticism to be an elite defender, his passing is nothing to write home about... so why?? Relatively small dudes who can get some buckets are a dime a dozen...

How's he a better fit than let's say Trey Burke -- especially now that Burke is working hard to defense...?"
4848,2020-09-03 17:32:23,ilxboo,"Agree about Edwards, I'd rather explore trade down options before taking him at 1 if I'm Rosas. Would rather have a wing/forward that will compliment Towns and Russell better, plus additional bench depth/a pick next year."
4849,2020-09-03 17:52:10,ilxboo,Terry at 34 is a fleece for us
4850,2020-09-03 21:46:20,ilxboo,"> Agreed on LaMelo at 1 I don't think Edwards is as seamless of a fit as people are portraying it.

He really isn't. I think most people are just assuming that he's a better fit than Ball (a PG when the Wolves already have DLo) or Wiseman (a C when the Wolves already have KAT) because he's a SG. 

However, even ignoring the issues with defense and motor, Edwards did the majority of his scoring out of pure iso plays, he didn't do much as a scorer or passer out of the pick-and-roll, and he was a bad spot-up shooter (only 28.9% shooting on catch on shoot jumpers). The lack of P&R ability makes him a poor fit with KAT, and the lack of catch and shoot ability makes him a poor fit with DLo."
4851,2020-09-03 20:46:08,ilxboo,"Probably just BPA with regard to Scrubb. It’s the late second round so just a crapshoot at that point, no need to worry about fit."
4852,2020-09-03 21:17:44,ilxboo,Same. I've been watching him since he was a freshman at Kansas and said he'd be really good in a Spurs uniform one day. Not to mention Timmy mentoring him would be a plus.
4853,2020-09-03 19:28:00,ilxboo,"Same, i would maybe prefer Woodard or Bane with the Clippers pick, but im good with Hughes too"
4854,2020-09-03 20:25:24,ilxboo,I'd probably prefer Terry with the clippers pick but I do love Hughes for the skills and his intangibles. Idk about Nico Mannion tho
4855,2020-09-05 02:40:05,ilxboo,"According to this we’d have the opportunity to walk away with Hayes, Bane, Nico/Riller.  Yes please"
4856,2020-09-03 19:27:43,ilxboo,Man Williams at 11 and Riller at 41 would be incredible. Two guys who could (hopefully) fill the spots of Rudy and Patty over the next few years.
4857,2020-09-04 01:55:13,ilxboo,Ive been watching tillie since last year and hope we can get him. I think we need more skill in a back up center if Jakob is going to be our starter
4858,2020-09-03 21:19:42,ilxboo,"I honestly feel he could be more than Clint Capela. He is a beast though, which I agree."
4859,2020-09-05 11:29:52,ilxboo,Honestly I rather just trade up and get Tyler Bey.
4860,2020-09-04 05:32:38,ilxboo,I was a little confused too that Terry just miraculously fell to 34 for us here
4861,2020-09-03 18:32:23,ilxboo,"He says they prioritize him and Deni and if Avdija isn't available, they're going for him. Also points out that it will make their league-worse defense even more terrible, apparently they don't care."
4862,2020-09-03 20:36:52,ilxboo,okoro is the perfect guy
4863,2020-09-04 03:59:50,ilxboo,I think Sexton and Okoro are friends so I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s there the Cavs take him. Fits exactly what they’re looking for defensively as well.
4864,2020-09-04 01:50:49,ilxboo,"Just curious, what’s the knock on him? Everything I’ve heard seems to indicate he’ll be great offensively, and sure his defense isn’t great but that matters less and less it seems"
4865,2020-09-03 20:47:31,ilxboo,Why not? He projects as the best overall offensive prospect in the draft.
4866,2020-09-04 20:51:39,ilxboo,"Having Bridges, Cam Johnson, and Vassell locked in for a long time would be awesome. All those guys do is make positive contributions.

I have a dream of watching those three in a lineup with ayton and Booker playing point for stretches"
4867,2020-09-03 22:07:15,ilxboo,"Passing on Edwards for Okongwu and Okoro for the sake of short-term investment doesn’t make sense to me. All of them are equally risky, being extremely young and underdeveloped in certain important areas of their game"
4868,2020-09-03 20:45:10,ilxboo,Let's get weird with it.
4869,2020-09-04 01:33:07,ilxboo,"I loooove Terry/Malachi/Joe in the 2nd, I’d rate all those guys as late first prospects.

I don’t know enough about RJ Hampton to really have thoughts on him, but I’d rather Desmond Bane there, or trade up to 18 or 19 for Maxey or Cole. If either of those guys or Kira drops close to our pick, I think it’s worth a trade up provided we give up one early 2nd.

Also wish we would’ve nabbed Riller at one of those 2nd round picks, but Vecenie is clearly much lower on him than I am."
4870,2020-09-04 01:29:58,ilxboo,"Makes no sense to me. I get him not being a lottery pick or anything, but he’s perfect in the 20’s as instant bench offense for a contender. If he drops out of the 1st, I’d be shocked to see him get passed the Sixers couple picks in the early 2nd."
4871,2020-09-03 23:13:25,ilxboo,Do you like picking Udoka there even with some of the other guys who are still on the board in this scenario?
4872,2020-09-03 22:55:41,ilxboo,"What does Tillman do for the Cs that they don't have enough of? I would think (but obviously not sure) that if they pick up a big in the draft it's either someone who can shoot from the outside, not being completely sold on Grant there, or someone who can bang with 7 footers in the post when necessary, as Kanter has one more year on his"
4873,2020-09-03 19:21:41,ilxboo,"Logic dictates PG or C, but maybe it's that Okoro has the most upside from who's left. Maybe they move up, where there are higher upside players who fit their needs, or move down the pick to get 2 or more (like suggested on this sub a few weeks ago, possibly with BOS) where they can fit more needs

Edit: revisited the article to see the explanation, basically he pins it to the new GM who was in OKC prior, where they valued athletic, hard working wings, regardless of their shooting ability. He's assuming it will carry on to DET."
4874,2020-09-04 00:49:13,ilxboo,"I think the idea is that because OKC always seemed to draft the most  athletic wing available, Troy Weaver will do it in Detroit too."
4875,2020-09-03 20:19:34,ilxboo,"I'm not high on Delon, plus he has 2 years/$17.5M remaining, compared to any PG you'd take at #15, on a 4-year/$15.765M deal (based on original predictions, will probably be lower) with 2 team options. I guess if they like Wright and want maybe Jalen Smith they can go for it, but that means you have 48 minutes of non-shooting PG. Dallas would probably take it, as Wright was completely out of rotation in the playoffs, plus at #15 they can get a quality wing (probably)."
4876,2020-09-03 22:56:44,ilxboo,"Doesn't Kanter have another year on his deal? He signed a 2 year contract. Wanamaker is on the minimum now and should make more elsewhere so I don't expect him to be back, but there are candidates to take his minutes on the roster now. None of them have looked very good at PG this season, but Carsen, Tremont Edwards, and Romeo might all get a shot at some 3rd string PG minutes if only to see what the team has there. If the team takes Poku / Bolmaro, I'm not 100% that the strategy is draft and stash - Poku could use professional NBA strength training for one - but instead to take big risks in hopes of hitting on a star because the roster is so well filled out otherwise."
4877,2020-09-03 23:10:47,ilxboo,He already agreed to an unpaid internship with the Spurs.
4878,2020-09-03 20:51:46,ilxboo,Stop yelling
4879,2020-09-05 13:57:49,ilxboo,"What?

Burke isn’t a good defender. Maxey is a very good one. Saying Maxey doesn’t have the athleticism to be a good defender makes me think, or makes me know that you’ve never watched Maxey tape. He’s a very good athlete.

He was considered one of the best shooters in the class before the cal system hurt him.

Lots of Kentucky players go to the pros and become very good at things where they either limited by system or just weren’t allowed to at all.

Bam wasn’t handling at Kentucky 
Booker was mainly considered a spot up shooter
KAT didn’t shoot at all and now he’s the best stretch big in the league, could be all time level in that regard.

And theoretically the fit next to luka would be great. His great POA defense would be a major help next to luka. He would be a secondary playmaker, able to create for others & himself. If there’s the change from the flashes he’s shown that he becomes a pretty good shooter then the Mavericks no doubt got a steal at 18"
4880,2020-09-03 22:14:23,ilxboo,Edwards still has the most likelihood of becoming a superstar out of anyone in this draft imo. I think the fit might not be perfect but it might actually be better than people think. I see a real possibility that LaMelo simply struggles like Lonzo and doesn’t have great value after he starts to see playing time and so trading him later on seems like a losing proposition.
4881,2020-09-04 13:12:07,ilxboo,I don’t think there’s a chance he’s still available at 41. I think he’s a FRP
4882,2020-09-04 03:42:03,ilxboo,"Laterally he seems very slow, which makes him unplayable in the pick and roll.  Offensively he seems like he has good hands and he can establish position early."
4883,2020-09-03 20:16:44,ilxboo,None of the Athletic writers have any sources within the Cavs anymore so I wouldn't worry about it.   Toppin won't be their pick.  Thanks for posting the mock.
4884,2020-09-04 02:20:14,ilxboo,That's grim if they don't care about defence at all. I'd question what his sources are on that though.
4885,2020-09-03 19:12:08,ilxboo,Where did you hear that?
4886,2020-09-05 11:13:14,ilxboo,"He doesn’t have a neck, which is weird for a tall guy. It makes him look like he isn’t mobile."
4887,2020-09-04 00:19:31,ilxboo,"I worry a lot about Obi on offence. Just look at him in the post, absolutely no finesse or technical ability, he scores because he was 22 and far stronger than the weak bodied college kids.

I was higher on him but as i had nothing to do i really deep dived his game. I don't think his shot is particularly great, he is bad at putting it on the floor and even in the half court he looks sluggish.

He was put in a simple offsenive system where he could easily score against weaker defenders in PnR and in the Post.

His offensive game is flawed and his defence is atrocious. I think it is absolute lunacy to take him high in this draft."
4888,2020-09-03 21:38:27,ilxboo,"Older than all their other young prospects 

Atrocious defensively ,and the cavs are already bad enough on that end as is."
4889,2020-09-04 22:43:21,ilxboo,"Although, to reach the finals, one of those guys should at least end up as an All-Star."
4890,2020-09-04 02:25:19,ilxboo,"Not to mention if the Warriors keep the pick then whoever it is will be coming off the bench. Edwards/whoever else might not be able to contribute in the playoffs, but they could still give the Warriors 20-25 minutes in the regular season."
4891,2020-09-04 02:18:47,ilxboo,"Not really, both O’s have respectable floors as winning defense-first, high energy role players which is great for a team in the Warriors position. Theyve fit guys like Mckinnie and Jordan Bell into the rotation on championship teams. 

The problem with Ball and Edwards is that in the short term they may just be negatives on the court when it comes to playoff basketball because of their lack of defense and questionable habits"
4892,2020-09-04 03:46:35,ilxboo,"I agree with these takes. RJ I'm not too high on and I would rather trade up in the range to have a chance at Maxey/Kira/Cole. I really would like to trade up this year. Also wish we git Riller, I'd take him before Flynn tbh. Riller is a 1st round talent."
4893,2020-09-04 02:00:03,ilxboo,"On his big board (updated yesterday) he has him at 26. He's said in the past he's higher on him than most and has a first round grade on him. Must be hearing something to consistently mock him in the mid 40s

e: Had him going 48 in his mock the day after the lottery, and 47 back in July.  Meanwhile on his big board, which usually comes out around the same time as his mock, Riller has been bouncing between 25 and 26."
4894,2020-09-03 23:27:51,ilxboo,Can’t lie and say that I’ve seen him but the description is that he can defend the post and communicates constantly on defense too. Not great on perimeter but knows his strengths and weaknesses. Can pass and makes right read on offense. Doesn’t this feel like an easy fit for the Celtics?
4895,2020-09-03 23:59:03,ilxboo,"I’ve watched every game of Tillman’s college career, he will definitely be able to guard big guys down low"
4896,2020-09-05 14:09:31,ilxboo,None of the Celtics bigs have this defensive Iq while also being very good rim protectors. Grant just isn’t a good interior defender. Tillman is a very very good one. Tillman is also a very good passer and is a much better roller then grant
4897,2020-09-03 20:39:53,ilxboo,"I'd have to agree with you. I don't think it's any secret that the Magic are looking for guards, but I think Delon would work well with them. From what I've seen, he's a player that does a lot better with a defined role. He's a distributor with plus defense. We have a surplus of distributors. I think he would work decently in the Magic system. It's all about how they value Aminu. He's dealt with injuries and they seem to be perpetual purgatory with 6'7-7'0 bigs with thin PG Depth. I don't think anyone they'd target at 15 would be gone at 18 and Delon could be an insurance pick up if nothing else. They also have the same contract length with Delon getting a 1.5 less in their final contract year"
4898,2020-09-03 23:15:41,ilxboo,"He’ll probably have a better career in San Antonio than Atlanta...let’s just be honest lol.

Any player probably would 😭"
4899,2020-09-03 19:15:03,ilxboo,It's in the article
4900,2020-09-04 02:38:41,ilxboo,"Assuming the Warriors are drafting out of Edwards, Wiseman, Avdija, Okoro, and Haliburton, I actually can see whoever they draft contributing someone solid minutes in the playoffs. I know people are low on this draft, but almost all the top prospects have specialized skill sets that I can see them excelling with if they’re placed in a role that doesn’t ask too much of them. It’s unlikely that these guys will be stars from Day 1 like Zion and Morant, but solid role players? Absolutely"
4901,2020-09-04 02:26:37,ilxboo,"You can be negative on the floor by being a non-contributor on offense as well. I don’t know why people always assume it’s only a problem if you’re a poor defender and not the inverse. 

Not sure why you’re bringing up McKinnie and Bell either. There’s not really a point in being high-energy if you’re a bad defender, which was especially true in McKinnie’s case. In fact, he was so bad that he couldn’t even win a job as Glenn Robinson’s backup last season and got promptly cut after training camp. That’s not going to be what the Warriors are hoping for out of a top-3 pick.

As it stands Okoro is a non-shooter who generated a majority of his offense at PF at 6’6 and 220-pounds. Okongwu doesn’t really have a translatable offense to the NBA outside of catching lobs and rim-running.

I literally said it lol. If the Warriors have won championships with those guys in the rotation, then they’d feel comfortable with Okoro (Mckinnie role) or Okongwu (Bell role) sliding in and playing playing their roles.

>As it stands Okoro is a non-shooter who generated a majority of his offense at PF at 6’6 and 220-pounds. 

Which is okay with the Warriors spacing and movement. He’s a great cutter, screener, can offensive rebound, terror in transition. He can fill a role on offense. Just because he’s not a shooter doesn’t mean he’s a negative offensively

>Okongwu doesn’t really have a translatable offense to the NBA **outside of catching lobs and rim-running.**

Which can make you a positive on offense. Especially considering Steph and Klay’s gravity

To my larger point. I can’t see how you would think Edwards or Ball arent “riskier” for a team like the Warriors when they both play no defense and have shot selection and effort concerns. The whole point of trading back would be to get a guy like either O or Vassell who they have confidence in plugging into smaller roles, while also getting another asset/rotational player"
4908,2020-09-04 00:13:10,ilxboo,"If the Celtics can grab a 21 year old Theis that can grow with their young nucleus, I can't imagine they wouldn't. However, that would mean they see Tillman as a future Theis which who knows if they do."

4911,2020-09-04 04:01:13,ilxboo,"You can’t be seriously thinking the Warriors are trying to find a McKinnie and Bell with a top draft pick. McKinnie was awful for the Warriors and they were forced to play him only because injuries forced their hand. And where are you coming up with this narrative that either contributed heavily in their championship run? Bell averaged under 9 minutes a game in postseason and was straight up inactive for half of their games. Similar story with McKinnie. 

The Warriors can find a wing who’s a good cutter, screener, and rebounder for the veteran minimum. That was literally McKinnie’s role on the team, who got cut for all his effort because that’s all he offered.

With Okongwu, similarly, the Warriors can find rim-running and lob-catching from any random center off the street. That’s literally Chriss’s role on the team, who not to mention is more athletic and offensively skilled than a 19-year old Okongwu. Why would they draft a center in the top-10 to be a poor man’s Chriss as a rookie?

What’s important for a NBA GM with a top-3 pick is understanding the concept of value, which I don’t think you’re quite comprehending. Drafting a player with a top-3 pick solely for the purpose of filling a role that had historically been filled by second-round picks and undrafted players would be a hilariously awful mismanagement of resources. Veteran minimum contracts exist for a purpose. Top-3 draft picks exist for another purpose. And with the Warriors willingness to buy in on another former “bad shot-selection bad defense” experiment with Wiggins, I think they’ll be much more confident in Edwards’s ability to contribute than you. Which coincidentally is probably why every insider has been reporting that Edwards is #1 on their board"

4916,2020-09-04 04:14:27,ilxboo,"Look all I’m doing is explaining the rationale behind trading back, I’m not saying the Warriors will or won’t do this. Your OP was:

>Passing on Edwards for Okongwu and Okoro for the sake of short-term investment doesn’t make sense to me. All of them are equally risky, being extremely young and underdeveloped in certain important areas of their game

And I just disagree that they’re all “equally risky”. Okoro/Okongwu/Vassell/Haliburton, those guys are tailor made role players right now basically. And then by trading back you presumably will get another piece for depth or another asset. They may choose this route over a Ball or Edwards who are notorious for defensive shortcomings and displaying habits that aren’t conducive to winning. I’m that sense theyre **riskier** than the other guys listed.

I brought up Mckinnie and Bell not to say they were huge contributors but that if they even got any PT as 2nd round/undrafted-type talents, then the Warriors would be really comfortable playing more gifted (and frankly higher IQ) guys like the O’s in those same roles.

You can disagree with the strategy or think it’s not optimal, but I was giving you the rationale as to why they might do it, and also refuting the notion that they’re all “equally risky”. Ball and Edawards can rightfully scare some ppl whereas some of those other guys down the board are more like coaches’ dreams."
4917,2020-09-04 00:22:52,ilxboo,"Maybe, but as a Celtics fan I don't really see the similarity between the two players. Theis is much more vertical than Grant."
4918,2020-09-06 05:43:13,ilxboo,"Timelord isn’t a great passer at this point. He has shown the ability to take the ball up the court and make a few nice reads, which is farther ahead then most bigs, but tillman is the far superior passer"
4919,2020-09-04 04:24:37,ilxboo,"The only possibility of Edwards being “riskier” than the field is if he has attitude problems and doesn’t buy in to being a role player. Sure, that’s a risk, but as an outsider, I’m not in position to comment on character. I trust the Warriors will perform a thorough background check on all players and they’ll be a much better judge of that than me.

But in terms of pure ability, Edwards is undoubtedly the safest pick to be a postseason contributor in his rookie season. He’s at least as offensively talented as guys like Okoro and Okongwu are defensively, and his athleticism and defensive flashes give him All-NBA Defense potential. It’s not a matter if he can develop given a few years like with Okoro’s shot, which is outside of his control. Edwards’s biggest flaws are purely a matter of want-to and will only exist as long as he allows them to"
4920,2020-09-04 00:33:32,ilxboo,"Theis does a better job with vertical contests and the like, but I bet their actual vertical leap is pretty similar."
4921,2020-09-07 02:37:16,ilxboo,He has shown the ability to not just make the obvious pass but the next one. I think he has a fair shot at it long term. Also Grant is at least Tillman's equal as a passer.
4922,2020-09-04 04:41:40,ilxboo,"My man Edwards is just not a high IQ player in general, it’s not just about  the “want-to”. On the ball when he puts in the effort yeah he’s a plus, but he’s a bad off-ball defender no matter what right now. I agree about the Warriors being confident in their coaching staff and player development, but it’s tough to say how quickly Edwards IQ would improve. 

The larger point I was getting about in terms of risk is that Okoro and Okongwu are plug-and-play positives; they wouldn’t have to change a thing about their games and they’d be helpful rotation players and could get minutes in the postseason. The risk with them is more in terms of upside (which may not concern the Warriors if they’re looking at a 2-4year window anyway).

Edwards/Ball, it’s a lot of projection and talking yourself into how they fit immediately; thats inherently risky. I actually think their upside is less risky, but the short term growing pains would be the issue. 

Not really gonna argue this point myself, but there was an article post on this sub where they interviewed multiple college coaches in the conference about the prospects... multiple SEC coaches favored Okoro to Edwards or pointed out that he affected winning more. Down the road maybe Edwards makes enough improvements to separate himself but **right now** you can argue Okoro helps you win more."
4923,2020-09-04 06:19:50,ilxboo,"Grant has an atrocious 31"" vertical. Theis is at least a little bouncy."
4924,2020-09-04 02:25:21,ilxboo,"Nah Theis is bouncy if a little undersized. He’s not Robert Williams athletic but he catches lobs, blocks shots, finished above the rim on dump-offs. Grant Williams plays woefully groundbound around the rim"
4925,2020-09-07 16:37:35,ilxboo,Grant is not his equal whatsoever. He was a complete black hole offensively for 95% of the year.
4926,2020-09-04 02:45:05,ilxboo,"Their rate based block numbers are relatively similar (1.8 v 1.2 / 36 min) and I attribute the difference more to Theis' superior sense of timing than raw athleticism. Honestly I think it's a huge credit to Theis' bbiq as much as anything. It's also a fairly common sight in Celtics games to see someone throw Theis a lob and him fail to dunk it. I love Theis, but he's probably among the league leaders in failed lobs per game"
4927,2020-09-07 23:51:02,ilxboo,"Black hole is a very weird descriptor to apply to Grant, to the point that I'm now questioning how much you've watched him play. There have certainly been times where Grant was a net negative offensively, but it was never the case that he was a black hole - [a player where the ball went into his possession and never came back out again, i.e. a selfish player or gunner](https://www.thestepien.com/2019/08/28/draft-notes-black-hole-apocalypse/). That is so far from how Grant has played and occasionally been bad. Grant overthinking things offensively and he passing up open shots because he isn't confident, those are the times he's offensively at his worst."
4928,2020-09-04 02:52:18,ilxboo,"Like I said he’s not Robert Williams athletic and he’s a little undersized while not being very long. The fact that he even blocks shots and finishes above the rim at all is a testament to his ups and even if theyre not spectacular, he’s undoubtedly bouncier than Grant Williams at the least. Grant will prob finish less than 5 lobs his whole career lol"
4929,2020-09-08 00:27:22,ilxboo,"That article says he thought Collins was a black hole. Not even comparative to williams. It’s a site looking at draft notes, not using their own independent definition to analyze nba players. Williams can’t shoot, and he can’t really be used as a roller much because he has almost zero vertical pop. He is an ok passer for a big man sure but his passiveness and lack of usage means that it’s not gonna be shown enough. The one real positive thing he does is set nice screens, and there’s a lot of bigs out there who can screen but also be a good roller unlike williams"

Offensively, he's a much better perimeter player than he is in the dunker spot. Like you said, he's very much not a vertical threat, but I think with confidence and timing we'll see a little more from him. I think Theis could outjump Grant, but that the margin is relatively small and certainly not enough to stop Grant from inhabiting that type of role."
4931,2020-09-08 00:46:26,ilxboo,"I'm just using it as an example of the commonly accepted definition, not a metric. 

None of what you said, whether I agree or disagree, points to Grant Williams being a black hole offensively. Did you have him confused with another player?"
4932,2020-09-04 03:24:48,ilxboo,">I think Theis could outjump Grant, but that the margin is relatively small and certainly not enough to stop Grant from inhabiting that type of role.

Hmm I just disagree, Theis is pretty functional as a rim runner/diver because of his bounce. Grant will never be able to fill that role extensively because he’s so ground bound. Theis had 81 dunks (to Grant’s 5) this year, so over 1/gm and in his somewhat limited minutes. Its a pretty big part of his identity as a player

I agree Grants had some impressive contests at the rim but he’s so heavy he usually needs a wind up. He’s also about 2” shorter. He’s a 4 that can spend some time at the 5 but he’s fundamentally gonna full a different role than what Theis does for them."

4934,2020-09-04 04:07:09,ilxboo,"That's fair on the roll for the most part. I think Grant will be quite good on play making out of the short roll and pick and pop. Personally though, I think of Theis' role as defined more by defense than it is offense and that's where Grant can play like Theis. I also think Grant will play his most productive minutes essentially as a 5, primarily guarding the other team's biggest player, with some match up exceptions."
4935,2020-09-08 14:46:01,ilxboo,"That's just the definition of the term, not really a perspective of theirs. You can find it elsewhere too. It's also a term that really doesn't fit Grant Williams game in the very slightest. Never said anyone was dumber than anyone else bc of their takes on individual basketball players. That would be really dumb. I still don't know how you would call Grant an offensive black hole without being confused as to who he was though."

He spent big in FA for 2017 but didn't fine tune the roster or prepare for depth. With our Taven Pick, we could have selected any position for Offense or secondary. We could have looked to move on from older FAs like Bouye with a CB pick (giving us insurance for the Ramsey debacle). We could have signed a bunch of cheap depth guys to longer deals under the knowledge that our big names are only rentals.

Instead, its like Dave looks at each season as its own thing. He doesn't pay attention to the previous season or the next few. Just a very short-sighted GM who, as of right now, seems to solve his problems by offloading players for assets."

4944,2020-09-03 19:19:06,ilwpj6,"I agree with some of the sentiment here, but your grading is super inconsistent. So much of the draft discussion is biased with hindsight which clearly Caldwell didn't have the luxury of at the time. The only egregious picks are, with context, much less egregious (with the exception of the Taven Bryan pick imo).   


* Bortles was their #1 QB in a bad QB draft. Say what you want about him but we got to the AFC championship game with a bottom-5 receiving corps. Bridgewater or Jimmy G pre-NE aren't a significant upgrade. 
* Like someone else said, Fowler just proved he's better than he was on the Jags and certainly nobody thought he was bad coming out of Florida. Defensively the only 1st rounder that turned out significantly better was Peters.
* Taven was a shit pick. 
* Your take on Wingard is bad, coaches talk him up and he's great on special teams.
* Hitting on UDFA's and late-round talent easily makes up for a couple bad early round selections which can be historically hit-or-miss, even for the absolute greats.

Our largest issues revolve more-so around the fact that when we needed a QB we picked the one we thought best in the draft and didn't move on from him as quickly as reddit wanted us to. I don't think we're the franchise to maximize Lamar's potential and drafting one sooner than that would've been ""too soon"" regardless of what all of us internet GM's think."

Caldwell found three pro bowl talents in Robinson, Smith and Kinder, plus Lee, Colvin and Hurns. An ""A"" draft is any draft that yields alone perennial pro bowl player. This was an A+.

In 2013, he decided to let go of well-liked veterans with long tenures (e.g. Daryl Smith, Rashean Mathis, Greg Jones) who wanted to re-sign, would not have been expensive, and (at least in the case of Smith and Mathis) went on to have several more productive seasons with other teams.  Instead, he brought in guys like Geno Hayes, Alan Ball, and Justin Forsett who were all worse players and ended up getting replaced themselves within a few years.  In addition, he constantly churns the back end of the roster, releasing productive special teams/role players (like LaRoy Renolds) to make boom-or-bust waiver claims.  Think about if the Jags were your employer: how would you feel if productive, well-liked employees with long tenures were fired and replaced with someone inferior that was paid a higher salary?

I'm not getting into if other teams have backups from the draft still, just find jt hilarious that 2013 gets such a bad rap from most individual teams but a lot of people dont look at the draft as a whole."
4972,2020-09-03 19:40:47,ilwpj6,"Yeah, that definitely sounds plausible.  Sounds similar to his obsession with shoehorning Denard Robinson as a RB for like 3 seasons."
4973,2020-09-03 22:03:53,ilwpj6,"OK so the logic of Caldwell defenders is that the 

2013 draft doesn't count because it was bad all around 

2014 was good because Bortles looked OK for one season and ARob, Linder, Smith were good players.

2015 was OK because Fowler ended up being a decent situational pass rusher for the Rams. 

2016 was great because of Ramsey (a pick any GM would have made in the same scenario), Jack (who has regressed substantially since 2017 and received a monster extension) and Yann (who should have received the extension instead of Jack).   

The good players from 2017-2019 were Caldwell's decision (Chark, Minshew, Allen) and the bad players were Coughlin's (Fournette, Robinson, Oliver, every day 3 pick aside from Minshew)."
4974,2020-09-03 22:13:12,ilwpj6,Man im not a caldwell defender. I'm not even a jags fan. I just like Minshew and I'm here for a good time lol

4976,2020-09-03 14:12:59,iltus0,"Fantastic write up.  Here are my thoughts.

* (+) Mike White.  I don't think they're going into the season with just 2 QB's on the 53 after last year's mess.
* (+) Lawrence Cager.  I think they really like this dude, they're giving him a lot of opportunities for an UDFA.
* (-) Vyncent Smith.  I think he's going on the PUP, he won't be ready any time soon.
* (+) Josh Andrews.  I think he's just a JD guy, and he seems to be the first man up when Lewis and Van Roten are out for any reason.
* (-)  Conor McDermott .  I don't think they're particularly high on McDermott.
* (-)  Patrick Onwuasor .  He'll start on PUP.
* (+) James Burgess.
* (-) Jordan Willis.  I had to cut him to make room for the 3rd QB."
4977,2020-09-03 14:45:49,iltus0,"Really good projections and write up. 

I think you might be spot on with Jeff Smith. I think they could try to stash him and Cager on the practice squad.

Mike White seems to have impressed but it’s hard to find a spot for him once Flacco returns. I think they might actually have him be the primary back up until then because I doubt they’d want Morgan to have to see any snaps yet.

I’ll predict Franklin-Myers over Willis. I liked him as a dark horse this year and heard some good things about him. 

Going through this makes me realize how much I miss the preseason. Some people hate it but I love it. Get to form our own opinions on the fringe players, key in on a few guys, and have a stress free night of football because the results don’t matter."
4978,2020-09-03 15:06:31,iltus0,Spot on!  I do think White and Cager make the roster somehow though.  They’ve played too well during training cramp.
4979,2020-09-03 15:24:24,iltus0,"Can anyone tell me why we’d want to cut Bryce Huff, everything about him/work ethic seems right up JDs ally. He seemed like a shoe in once we picked up from UDFA"
4980,2020-09-03 14:02:37,iltus0,"Loved reading this. I hope Cager beats out Vyncint for that last WR spot. Other than that, this looks like reality barring any surprises."
4981,2020-09-03 14:48:39,iltus0,Great stuff!
4982,2020-09-03 15:15:36,iltus0,I believe they'll keep a third QB because of the pandemic. I'm not sure of who I'd take out of the roster for him though.
4983,2020-09-03 20:29:45,iltus0,"This is my first year really paying attention to camp and cuts so I’m probably pretty far off base here, but I thought Jeff Smith would have a good chance to make the roster. I’ve heard a ton of good things from the beat reporters at camp via twitter and thought he was getting 1st team reps due to injuries."

I totally forgot we have one of the biggest under-the-radar beasts in the league in Foley. Shame on me!"
4986,2020-09-05 05:37:30,iltus0,I hope they hold onto White until they can get a pic for him
4987,2020-09-03 14:11:35,iltus0,"Nice write up, thanks.  Pretty spot on, I think. Don't disagree with much of anything.  Will be interesting to see which guys get stashed on the practice squad.  Think it's up to 16 this year?"
4988,2020-09-03 14:28:23,iltus0,"Good thoughts! My only notes would be that you can’t transfer players onto PUP once they’ve participated in training camp (Vyncint Smith and Patrick Onwuasor). We’d have to put them onto the initial roster, let waivers clear, then put them on IR if we want to bring them back later in the season. 

As for the other moves, I went back and forth on Andrews and McDermott and could absolutely see if going either way. Both are versatile backups. I really wanted White or Fales on the roster too but just ran out of spots. 

Thanks for reading!"
4989,2020-09-03 15:10:46,iltus0,"Yeah, except for switch Cager for Vyncint Smith, I think the rest looks right. Also was thinking they might keep Dan Brown and get rid of McDermott."
4990,2020-09-03 20:40:40,iltus0,Because he hasn’t done anything in camp
4991,2020-09-03 14:54:44,iltus0,You can only have so many receivers. He probably will end up on the practice squad
4992,2020-09-03 20:41:24,iltus0,What makes you say Clark is getting abused
4993,2020-09-03 18:28:31,iltus0,I hope they don't keep Brown.  He's bad and they don't need 4 TE.
4994,2020-09-04 13:11:52,iltus0,He got banged up twice already.. just a feeling
4995,2020-09-03 19:28:22,iltus0,I thought they needed him last year when injuries got bad and in 2 TE fronts when they were blocking at the goal line. Didn't get to see much of Grifin and Herndon in all situations because of injuries. I thought he had a TD last year also... no love lost though if he goes

History tells us that EVERY SINGLE SPAC who fails to make a big jump after an announcement and trades this low before the merger, ALWAYS tanks at the ticker change.

What you’re doing is making a strong argument to buy the dip, but you might as well just throw away money if you buy now.

If things turn around, what's to stop them from resuming their originally planned IPO? On the other hand:

>the United States has now overtaken Australia as their largest and fastest growing market

if there's a second wave of Covid in the US (possibility estimated to occur in Oct/Nov) it's not going to help their expansion into the US market. You're saying they can rely on merger cash and Australian revenue to continue their expansion anyways?

In 2018 she spent like $100k to franchise it and another $50k to do the build-out.  She was just about to be profitable before Covid hit.  Now it has completely decimated her business.  All the money she spent on marketing has been completely eviscerated.  She got a PPP loan but is living on unemployment because the business has basically no revenues.

I am of the opinion that Crescent will add cash, if needed...if you look into the sponsors, they're very reputable and have significant financial backing and I don't think they'd let their one and only SPAC fail just because the market is temporarily missing the killer target they found. 

I have a feeling that they won't have to add cash and that shares will be trading above trust by the merger....I think they're going to be able to report the equivalent of a ""revenue beat"" in the update they give on franchise sales, based on the trajectory of the August 6 update.

It's possible that shares would fall below $10 after the merger, but F45's growth trajectory is such that I'm confident it'll bring the shares way up over the coming years and, at some point in the not-so-distant future, become a super hot stock."

To answer your specific question on the warrants vs. shares....since the warrants are so cheap relative to the growth of the company, I think they're more undervalued than the shares and I think the market is realizing that. I'm expecting the shares to start moving when Crescent starts their round of promotion in a few weeks, but obviously that's just speculation. A similar $ amount of shares & warrants seem to have traded the last few days, but there seems to be much less supply of the warrants that people are willing to sell."

Could COVID-19 be an overhang on the share price given their are currently lockdowns in Australia’s second largest city, and Australia is still a large part of the franchise base.  Until plnt gyms also were poor investments in most cases, so that may also be a factor dragging on the share price."
5069,2020-09-03 13:20:04,iliqk8,"$RPAY, $LPRO, and $VVNT would say you don’t exactly know what you’re talking about."
5070,2020-09-03 14:53:43,iliqk8,"Totally agree with this guy, doesn't make sense to catch a falling knife. I'm not willing to take the risk now. As of now, shareholders are incentivized to redeem their shares.

&#x200B;

 Well done DD Slowryder but I wrote a similar writeup for DMS and although it had solid fundamentals it still dropped."
5071,2020-09-03 00:48:04,iliqk8,"Great questions!

***If things turn around, what's to stop them from resuming their originally planned IPO?*** They've signed a definitive merger agreement, which is a legally binding contract.

***if there's a second wave of Covid in the US (possibility estimated to occur in Oct/Nov) it's not going to help their expansion into the US market. You're saying they can rely on merger cash and Australian revenue to continue their expansion anyways?*** They already have more locations in the USA than in Australia, so they're pretty well entrenched here. A second wave of Covid could slow them down, but it almost certainly won't kill them. They sold 144 franchises in June/July alone. 50 new studios also opened over that period. It takes an average of nine months for new studios to open, and they've proven that they just keep selling like hotcakes during Covid (after a couple slow months during the initial panic).

They have very little debt...the franchisees take on the risk. However, most franchisees seem to be doing fine. Of the 78% that were able to re-open as of early August, the median studio was back to 88% of pre-covid levels. I follow the #F45Training hashtag on IG and there are lots of images/videos of what appear to be full classes from various parts of the world.

There's the possibility of a second wave of Covid in Oct/Nov and there's also the possibility of a vaccine by October, arguably making reopening plays super hot. I don't care either way personally, as F45's proven new franchise sales resilience is setting them up to explode even more over the coming years. The next few months don't matter to me either way.

***Isn't that exactly what Covid did with their original IPO?***    
It changed their original IPO plans, but the company itself was not in dire straits. They went the SPAC route and they found a SPAC with highly reputable management that believes in them and their growth story."
5072,2020-09-03 13:28:29,iliqk8,">if there's a second wave of Covid in the US (possibility estimated to occur in Oct/Nov) 

What ""second wave""? The first wave is still going on. Thousands of people die every other day..."
5073,2020-09-03 03:15:36,iliqk8,"Enterprise value of $845 million, which is less than half their expected pre-covid IPO valuation

The expected 2021 EV / EBITDA is 11.9x, but that ratio will likely be revised downward because they're on track to exceed their 2020 new franchise sales projections by well over 100%"
5074,2020-09-03 10:25:03,iliqk8,"I personally believe that this will eventually be a Crossfit-killer, or at least siphon a portion of their membership. The company basically took everything that was wrong with Crossfit from a business-perspective and fixed it. Also, 65% of F45's customers are females vs. \~50% for Crossfit, presumably because F45 is a lot more accessible and less hardcore but still intense.

Here's what an early US-based (Ohio) franchise owner / ex-Crossfitter said:   
“...Before F45 I had become very involved with CrossFit. Being a former athlete I quickly dove into it and even competed at some regional events. As time passed I started to recognise elements within CrossFit that became more and more unsettling. I stepped away from it and began looking for something else and that’s when I found F45. I immediately knew after learning about and watching the promo video it was going to be a success and I needed to be a part of it. A year after that I opened the 1st U.S. location in Ohio and quickly realised that F45 was exactly what people were wanting and not getting. F45 has changed my life but more importantly I’ve been able to change so many other lives. The future of fitness is F45 Training and my future is brighter because of it.”"
5075,2020-09-03 07:04:43,iliqk8,"It has been described as a more accessible alternative to crossfit. It doesn't have the 'as many reps, as fast as possible' bro-ness so it has wider demographic appeal.

The typical customer is time-poor and not price-sensitive, so HIIT, and especially HIIT as a managed service, is an attractive proposition."
5076,2020-09-03 10:29:59,iliqk8,"Thank you! 

I think that's a perfect way to describe it, and that's interesting that that's what you're hearing. A friend of a friend works for Crossfit's equipment manufacturer, and he said that they're well aware that F45 is their biggest threat and that they seem scared."
5077,2020-09-10 03:02:59,iliqk8,"The market wants this to pop, but the problem is that either the SPAC arbitrage funds bought in when the price dropped below $10.15 before the market was paying attention, and they now have hundreds of thousands of shares for sale at $10.15 which is creating a formidable ceiling to building momentum or someone is shorting it either to makes pennies while it trades within range or in hopes of a post-merger drop. The sponsor is planning a marketing push near the close (early Q4), per investor relations, and I think they'll be able to get this out there. 

I've been adding to my position in common shares over the past week, and continue to add cash there. When buying in under $10.15, it's virtually risk-free ahead of the merger, and has great upside potential. (Just note that the commons can drop below $10 after the merger and are likely to do so if they do not succeed in breaking through that $10.15 wall. I personally am very optimistic, but I'm looking at it with a few year time horizon to be realistic.)"
5078,2020-09-10 03:12:01,iliqk8,"The valuation is less than half of what they were expecting pre-covid, and their projections for this year (calculated after covid started) are on track to be surpassed by 100%. I'd like to see their final numbers for this year before throwing out a valuation, but I think the above can give an idea."
5079,2020-09-13 13:45:03,iliqk8,"I think they’re reasonably priced at $1.25. If it were me and I were building a position from scratch again, I would average in. Look at LPRO and DMS for two different scenarios for how it could go short-term around the merger. (I’m bullish long-term regardless, but could go either way short-term.) LPRO redeemed their warrants so it’s hard to find their warrants chart but you can infer from the commons."
5080,2020-09-16 01:25:44,iliqk8,"Investor relations said about three weeks ago that it would be late Q3 / early Q4. They haven’t filed the definitive proxy with the shareholder vote date, so it’s looking like early Q4."
5081,2020-09-16 16:31:56,iliqk8,"You're welcome! Yea, keep an eye on it. Hard to say when the re-opening play in the market will come full-force, but it's looking to me like the Pfizer CEO is signalling pretty hard that their vaccine will more than likely be approved in October (and it's already being produced at three different locations)....not that everyone will have a shot in their arm for awhile, but I'm watching that catalyst pretty closely myself.

That being said, I think you could watch CRSA and have time to get in ahead of most when you see it trending the right way."
5082,2020-09-18 00:24:56,iliqk8,"There's not a great way to get the latest info....the last update was in early August and at that time, 78% of studios were reopened and of those, the median studio was at 88% of pre-covid revenue. 

I follow #F45 and #F45Training on Instagram, and have noticed that brand new studios are continuing to open, but it has been too hard to track how many due to the number of posts."
5083,2020-09-18 17:31:42,iliqk8,"I have a small position in CCXX, but only small right now because I haven't done nearly as much DD. The main reason I like CRSA so much is the return potential on the warrants that has presented itself because the market isn't favoring the deal right now. I believe that the market will favor it in due time based on their fundamentals. (May or may not end up with an immediate pop, but their growth rate should bring the stock up over the coming quarters/years.) I'll try to take a closer look at Multiplan soon, thanks for the recommendation!"
5084,2020-09-18 17:28:52,iliqk8,Thanks for reading!
5085,2020-09-06 01:08:33,iliqk8,"Great anecdote, though indeed very anecdotal when comparing to a global brand. By early August, 78% of studios were open and the median studio was back to 88% of pre-covid revenue. I’ve been following the hashtags on social media and the % open is definitely higher now, and they’re also killing it on franchise sales which drives their revenue.

Your friend took on the risk, as F45 franchisees do. The company doesn’t take the risk. However, F45 franchisees seem to be killing it.

F45 participants are pretty intense/dedicated...it’s a lifestyle to them. They’re going to be back in the studio as soon as the govt allows. It may not be for you, but check back in a month and see where it’s at."
5086,2020-09-25 04:17:27,iliqk8,"They’re down with most other SPACs. Volume is relatively thin, it doesn’t take much to bring the price down. There’s no F45-specific news. I added to my position today."
5087,2020-09-27 19:43:18,iliqk8,"Coming from a small business environment myself, I don't think that loans to the founders/owners are very unusual. They own the company so it's their money. That sort of behavior is in the past now.

Prior to a SPAC merger, there's a floor on the share price because each share is backed by the cash that the SPAC raised in their IPO which is held in a trust. After the merger, that cash is paid out in the transaction, and thus each share is no longer backed by it. Shareholders can redeem their shares for their share of the cash in trust two days before the merger closes. The current amount of cash in trust for CRSA is $10.15 (could be more like $10.17 now, but $10.15 was the last reported). Therefore, if the shares are trading under the amount of the trust, shareholders may redeem them for the few pennies of risk-free profit. If more than 30% of public shareholders redeem, Crescent would have to add money to the trust. I believe that this is unlikely to happen....you can look at $RPAY, $VVNT, and $LPRO for examples of companies that traded under trust up until a few days before the merger closed and then shot off. On the flipside, look at $DMS for an example of a company that's growing at a decent rate but still fell after the merger. With F45, I personally don't care much whether it jumps or falls at the merger....it's growing fast enough that I believe it'll be a good investment and I'm not trying to time entry on the warrants (I will, however, sell my shares if it does not jump shortly before the merger)."
5088,2020-09-03 13:16:20,iliqk8,"They’re going to do their marketing around the close, I doubt it’ll still be trading at trust. There is a minimum cash requirement and it would not be met if greater than 30% of public shareholders cashed out. However, as I addressed in the DD, I am convinced that Crescent will back this with more cash if needed until the market comes around. I don’t think it will be needed.

They’re paying out an original founder who exited the business, and they don’t need cash because the business requires very little capital to scale because the franchisees fund the growth. That founder is still maintaining 8% ownership.

The SPACs where they need the cash are risky because they’re trying to build a dream and it may or may not pan out. This is a rapidly growing cash cow that’s quickly building a global brand. The warrants are worth a good bit as a LEAP on a company growing 40-50% annually."
5089,2020-09-03 13:44:09,iliqk8,It’s not...I’ve been fully transparent about my plans for my position.
5090,2020-09-03 05:50:52,iliqk8,"Don’t be a dick. While I agree this will likely dip after the merger, the DD is interesting and maybe there will be a good opportunity to play this long with some cheap warrants at some point in the future."
5091,2020-09-03 10:25:07,iliqk8,Allow your negativity this guy took so much time to do this for people in this group
5092,2020-09-03 04:40:24,iliqk8,my only regret is not buying more at .60 while it sat there forever! there were legit buys after hours today up to 1.41. i saw a buy of 1k warrants happen at 1.29.
5093,2020-09-03 05:16:04,iliqk8,Is that statement documented somewhere or available in a recording?
5094,2020-09-09 07:43:09,iliqk8,Something like 0.8 each. Now they are a bit more expensive but I believe there's room to go. I would not touch them above 1.5. (most minor SPACs I'm in rarely break this wall without some major investor taking profits and dumping the price lower for a while)
5095,2020-09-03 04:18:28,iliqk8,as answered earlier. i ate up the warrant walls. what a steal!
5096,2020-09-03 13:31:32,iliqk8,"You can quote the fundamentals and your analysis till the cows come home, but this is a SPAC and all SPACs trend the exact same way. 

The market is telling you exactly what is going to happen here. It may have shot up intraday to 13 on the day of the announcement but within 48 hours it was back near its NAV and has steadily declined since.

Again SPACs have a distinct trading pattern as the initial investors who got in on day one and before are going to take their profits the second the ticker changes and the market clearly indicates there won’t be enough buyers to offset the selling and prevent a drop into single digits.

Again, I’m not saying there aren’t long term gains to be had here and I will certainly take note as something to buy if/when this drops to 5-7 range, but this is a horrible entry point right now. You’re buying into a guaranteed drop."
5097,2020-09-03 17:51:23,iliqk8,"Thanks for the heads up on your DD, I’ll check it out. In CRSA, I’m looking at a high probability of a 500%+ return within a few years. It has the potential to get hot sooner, but its 40-50% annual growth gives it an extremely high probability of realizing the max profit on the warrants in a few years. If DMS has similar characteristics, I’ll likely build a position."
5098,2020-09-04 00:12:28,iliqk8,"Just read your DD on DMS, great stuff! I really like the warrants on this. I'm going to open a small position tomorrow pending further understanding and may increase a good bit after achieving clarity."
5099,2020-09-03 01:02:45,iliqk8,"Follow-up, since you've been obviously tracking this SPAC for longer than I have. Any reason for the CRSA warrants jump today? It seems like it rode with the other SPAC warrants. Was there anything driving it or do you expect a dip?"
5100,2020-09-03 14:44:50,iliqk8,Just because one wave isn't finished hitting you doesn't mean a second wave can't come along and add to the first and increase the amplitude.
5101,2020-09-03 05:08:08,iliqk8,thanks bro. so the float is pretty small post merger. do you have a realistic price target 6-12 months from now?
5102,2020-09-10 05:12:27,iliqk8,"Are there enough arbitrage funds to do this? And, if that is the case, how can is retailers make a profit over time if they’re playing the game?"
5103,2020-09-21 15:58:44,iliqk8,Do u have list of all mergers
5104,2020-09-28 19:04:43,iliqk8,I’m actually an F45 member and most gyms have been open for quite sometime. Numerous classes are filled 80%+
5105,2020-09-25 04:29:38,iliqk8,I’m in Australia so have to take the exchange rate into account too. Reckon they will drop further?
5106,2020-09-03 04:45:17,iliqk8,"Dang, nice! I didn’t see any of the after hours data.

Yea, it was hard to see how quickly this was going to light off...no one was looking into it a week ago, but people are clearly waking up to how overlooked/undervalued this is."
5107,2020-09-03 10:05:51,iliqk8,"Negative, it was made verbally to me on a phone call after emailing IR. They were very responsive, so I imagine you could get the same. Please report back if you do."
5108,2020-09-09 08:27:58,iliqk8,"Thx. Yeah, picked up some SOAC when they were 0.85 just for fun. Not many $250M+ under a dollar. Once pre LOI warrants get above $2, I don’t see the point. Even IPOB/C, I’d just assume buy shares for the protect (act of God, etc)."
5109,2020-09-03 04:19:41,iliqk8,Haha nice!
5110,2020-09-03 14:05:29,iliqk8,"Let’s check back in 30 days. I’ve read the study on the behavior of SPACs that trade near NAV. I’m convinced that there’s enough of a probability that this is an exception that I have a large position.. I don’t care if I’m wrong, as my time horizon is several years for the majority of the position.

I’m not preaching a guaranteed quick gain here. I believe I’ve laid out my philosophy behind the position pretty clearly.

To clarify, it took over a month to slide to NAV...not 48 hours."
5111,2020-09-04 00:59:27,iliqk8,I would wait until later in the day. Looks like tech could potentially keep dropping tomorrow. Didn't look good in AH today.
5112,2020-09-03 01:21:30,iliqk8,"I've been following the market for the warrants pretty closely since near the start (first purchase was 6/29 at $2.68). In mid-August, a lot of supply came onto the market. Before that, it was hard to get fills at $0.80-$0.85 while the price was bouncing between $0.80-$0.90, and then starting one day in mid-August, there was constant supply which took the market down to \~$0.60. My theory is that a large fund was exiting a position. (The shares have 81% institutional ownership, so the ones that were in it at the beginning would've had a virtually $0 cost basis on the warrants.)

There's been a lot of DD discussion about F45 on various platforms over the past week, and people seem to be starting to take the time to look into them and discuss them more. On 8/31, the market seemed to work through the last of the seller's supply that had been bogging it down for a couple weeks, and it seems like there are not very many sellers now so it has started to run. Today, there was basically one big seller who seemed to offer lots of 20k every $0.05 and then would go up to the next $0.05 increment when the supply was worked off....not sure if it's a market maker or a single large seller, but it was very predictable and maybe algorithmic.

Very hard to say on a dip. I feel that they're tremendously undervalued relative to much worse SPAC mergers. I could see it running up to $1.50 or $2.00 and then trading in a range pending more merger news, but obviously I have no idea. If the 20k lot seller I mentioned is a fund selling rather than a market maker and their supply is worked through, it seems like there could be little resistance."
5113,2020-09-03 04:17:28,iliqk8,i'll tell you what happened. there was a HUGE wall at $1 and i ate it up. after that it shot up.
5114,2020-09-03 10:13:56,iliqk8,"I see it doubling within the next 1-2 years, if not sooner. Hard to say on exact timing since it just depends on when the market wakes up to this. It could do it around merger which would be great. Otherwise, I hope it’s not until a year out because I’d love for my 700%+ return on warrants to be taxed as long-term capital gains.

I think it’ll be a $50-$100+ stock within five years."
5115,2020-09-10 10:37:32,iliqk8,"Yes, I believe there are. First way to profit would be to buy warrants and hold those, potentially for a few years. Second is to park money risk-free in the commons and see if the arb’s supply gets worked off in the coming weeks. If it does, it can start to run and there will be all that upside with virtually zero risk."
5116,2020-09-21 18:56:29,iliqk8,SpacTrack.net is pretty good for that.
5117,2020-09-28 23:49:31,iliqk8,"Nice, good stuff--thanks for weighing in! I've been randomly sampling IG stories from F45 locations around the world and while they may only be showing their busiest classes, it seems like most are drawing lots of members."
5118,2020-09-25 12:20:25,iliqk8,Hard to say...I average in rather than try to fully load at a single price.
5119,2020-09-03 20:41:34,iliqk8,another after hours purchase of 1.40 today. me likey!
5120,2020-09-03 04:35:13,iliqk8,"it was like 11000 warrants at $1. i waited until it was evident it wasn't going back down. later another huge wall came up at 1.12 and either someone else ate it up or they backed off. 

i'm not paying much attention to the stats. common sense tells me this will do quite well. after all this lockdown crap, the health and fitness craze is going to boom."
5121,2020-09-03 04:36:03,iliqk8,"Planet Fitness stock is doing quite well. If that's not a great indicator, i don't know what is."
5122,2020-09-04 01:09:17,iliqk8,"Cool beans, thanks...I placed a few orders at set entry points. If I ultimately build a position, I’ll be averaging in for a bit."
5123,2020-09-27 03:28:38,iliqk8,Thanks it does not show when the mergers are happening?
5124,2020-09-03 23:34:15,iliqk8,Someone bought commons at $10.75 AH too but has to be a fluke.
5125,2020-09-03 04:43:07,iliqk8,"Yea and honestly F45 has a much better business model than Planet Fitness + global growth whereas PF hadn’t managed to stray too far from the US. 

F45 is well on its way to being a global cult fitness phenomenon whereas PF is just a cheap gym which is cool and all, but not sexy. As dumb as it is, I have to imagine that the market will apply a premium for the sexy factor once this heats up and it’s a hot stock."
5126,2020-09-04 00:05:15,iliqk8,the 1.40 was for 1400 warrants. ouch if that was a mistake too.
5127,2020-09-03 04:49:54,iliqk8,the celeb clients are hot too. sex appeal sells.
5128,2020-09-04 00:27:35,iliqk8,"Dang yea, that is pretty interesting when combined with the $10.75 share purchase AH. I see someone dropped $56k on warrants right at the end of the day too. Maybe the definitive proxy is coming tomorrow!"
5129,2020-09-02 22:28:38,ileaag,Excellent job!!! Thanks!!!
5130,2020-09-02 20:02:39,ileaag,"I'm assuming this was not written today, because there are some roster differences now (ex: Halapio). Heck, Duggan just reported Rysen is being let go and they brought in a second long snapper."

Jetts looked rusty as hell, but this from the guy who holds the record for scoring shots without a goal. 

Ryan provided the target, Darling did way more than the wall of stats above suggests (please for the love of God get rid of it - sucks to scroll past, my Reddit app almost crashes trying to fucking load it)

Nic Nat dominant in the middle, but Williams showed some spark. If it wasn't for Cole's unlikely goal, Williams goal would've been the best of the night for me. 

Hope Shuey is ok."
5134,2020-09-01 12:30:16,ikjany,Okay but how good was that Tommy Cole goal tho?
5135,2020-09-01 12:28:59,ikjany,"A win’s a win I guess, but that was not sustainable footy. Glad to get the points."
5136,2020-09-01 12:34:11,ikjany,"Talk about limping to the finish line. Our accuracy (and Liam Ryan) absolutely saved us there.

The consecutive short breaks are starting to cook us and we've still got a couple more to go. We'll take the four points but the bulldogs and saints aren't going to let us get away with playing like that.

On the plus side Williams and O'Neill are both showing some great signs."
5137,2020-09-01 12:55:16,ikjany,"More like Essendon def Essendon.

Daniher's shots on goal won us that game as much as our own did"
5138,2020-09-01 13:02:10,ikjany,"Simmo just said that Shuey is likely out for a couple of weeks. Really don’t think it was close enough to warrant putting him back out there. 

Petch and Kennedy likely available which is good."
5139,2020-09-01 13:03:34,ikjany,"Glad to have the win but it almost doesn't feel like a win. So many mistakes and a really clear lack of pressure. Can't tell if it's because of the quick turnaround of games or if we're only elite in Perth. With Yeo out, we need other to show a bit more hunger.

That said, there's a reason I've got this flair, what a performance from Ryan. Also liked the look of O'Neill and Williams, they seemed a lot more in control than last week."

5141,2020-09-01 12:37:58,ikjany,Average performance but great to get the 4 points. Hopefully Yeo coming back will lift our midfield

We looked cooked then and we have a massive tendency to lose our composure when that happens. Going to be a real tough game against the Bulldogs as they will try to run us off our feet. Some good signs from Williams and O'Neill but we need to think about our attack on the ball more. All well and good to have Gaff play a role where he is supposed to zone off and fill space but when we have Jetta doing the same thing it will just end up with other teams getting players to the ball and it will kill us. Hopefully they will fire up.

Also, i'm not sure if it's just me but have match threads been getting significantly worse this year? Seems like so much more bitching and moaning and less camaraderie between fans. The umpiring standard hasn't been great but fuck me it's not 10x worse than any other season."
5143,2020-09-01 14:11:17,ikjany,Does anyone know if the Eagles actually train at night in the Queensland hub? In actual game conditions?
5144,2020-09-01 14:51:31,ikjany,"Honestly, winning ugly gets us the same 4 points that winning pretty does, and with a shitload of injuries, consecutive 4-day breaks & living hub life, we’re just going to have to do what it takes to book the W’s in Queensland.    

Good effort to the boys, Liam Ryan is my spirit footballer."
5145,2020-09-01 13:05:18,ikjany,"Take the points. Essendon played a super high pressure, if ineffective, game and coming off two short breaks it could have really stung us if we weren't up for it in the first half.

I wish we had kept up the intensity in the second half but we did enough and that counts for something with these quick turnarounds.

Shuey coming back on was a mistake, as it looks like he's out for a couple of games now. Kennedy back next week will be very handy."
5146,2020-09-01 14:02:13,ikjany,"Seriously mods. Please fuck these long posts off, makes it so laggy on mobile and takes forever to scroll."
5147,2020-09-01 12:40:01,ikjany,[deleted]
5148,2020-09-01 12:49:00,ikjany,"Worst win I've seen in a while.

If the opposition weren't so horrid, we would have easily lost."
5149,2020-09-01 12:35:34,ikjany,"I really don’t know how Jetta or Hutchings got back into the team. We really miss Yeo. Time to play Brayshaw with Shuey injured, but you know we’ll see Ainsworth instead on Sunday"
5150,2020-09-02 04:34:30,ikjany,Proud of the boys. Grind out a win. Do that the next 3 weeks and we are looking really good for the finals.
5151,2020-09-01 13:01:06,ikjany,I agree great wall of stats could use remodelling .
5152,2020-09-01 12:45:08,ikjany,The Cole Train has no brakes
5153,2020-09-01 12:52:41,ikjany,"Definately not our best game but they still give us the 4 points.

Injuries are becoming a concern.

Hopefully Shuey is just hamstring awareness and we get Kennedy and Waterman back next match.

Then just Cripps and Yeo soon."
5154,2020-09-01 15:30:16,ikjany,"i think Simmo said it was our 3rd game in like 9 days, not a surprise we're running flat"
5155,2020-09-01 17:28:45,ikjany,"It’s not just you.  

Match threads are now full of bitterness, bile and bastardry. 

Such a shame really."
5156,2020-09-01 20:47:10,ikjany,"Yep match thread wasn't good
Disgusted at some eagle fan posts.

We played shit and we won. We shouldn't be talking shit about a team who actually played better than us (only accuracy let them down)"
5157,2020-09-02 00:11:59,ikjany,Waterman is due back too!
5158,2020-09-01 17:29:39,ikjany,There was a lot of work put into automating the stats posting.  I’m not going to undo that work.
5159,2020-09-01 12:54:10,ikjany,TBH we made the most of our inside 50 entries. We just couldn't get the ball out of our back half consistently. I don't know how much impact Kennedy would've had on that.
5160,2020-09-01 12:53:11,ikjany,"Don’t think it’s just Kennedy, there’s a lot of quality in the front half out. Cripps, Kennedy, Waterman then throw in Yeo."
5161,2020-09-01 12:46:18,ikjany,Jetta and Hutchings are in playing as half forwards because all our other half forwards are injured
5162,2020-09-01 12:42:31,ikjany,Give Ainsworth a crack in the middle and he’ll do alright. He had a good crack in the middle against hawks in the last
5163,2020-09-01 13:04:17,ikjany,"Like keep the first paragraph and then, a link to the wall of stats. Presented on a separate page, nicely."
5164,2020-09-01 14:49:13,ikjany,We should remodel it with a wrecking ball.
5165,2020-09-01 14:05:44,ikjany,"No thanks, he's been garbage every single match he's played for us in senior footy."
5166,2020-09-01 20:33:47,ikjany,I like your attitude.
5167,2020-09-01 22:53:33,ikjany,A woeful opinion
5168,2020-09-02 04:31:48,ikjany,Dude he has been terrible. What games have you been watching?  Delist at the end of the year and give a few games to other young mids.
5169,2020-09-01 04:12:32,ikdej7,"    Ben Cavarra - I think Cavarra deserves at least one more year to show us what he can do.
    Billy Gowers - Should not get another year, and I expect he will be let go.
    Brad Lynch - Will definitely leave the club. In fact, I am surprised he has not left already.
    Buku Khamis - One of the harder ones to judge, but hopefully he gets another year.
    Callum Porter - Will most likely get another year.
    Easton Wood - Will get another year.
    Fergus Greene - I have no idea. I expect for Fergus it will come down to list sizes and whether we have a sport for him or not.
    Jackson Trengove - Will almost certainly leave the club. He must feel very let down by the club for basically wasting the last years of his career.
    Jordon Sweet - Will most likely get another year.
    Lachie Young - Will most likely get another year.
    Lin Jong - It would be really harsh and disappointing to see him go, hopefully he gets another year.
    Matt Suckling - I'm really torn on this. I think his best football is still pretty good, but it could go either way.
    Roarke Smith - I think he is most likely to leave. He's been very unfortunate throughout his career, and it's disappointing that he never succeeded. 
    Ryan Gardner - I don't think he should be offered another year, but based on his current inclusion in our 22, I expect he will.
    Sam Lloyd - Doesn't offer anything of value to us anymore and should be let go
    Taylor Duryea - Unlucky year with injuries this year, and I'd like to see him hang around for another year
    Tory Dickson - Doesn't offer anything of value to us anymore and should be let go. A real shame, though, as he has been a terrific player for us.
    Will Hayes - Will most likely get another year.

To sum up what I would like:

To stay: Cavarra, Khamis, Porter, Wood, Greene, Sweet, Young, Jong, Suckling, Duryea, Hayes

To go: Gowers, Lynch, Trengove, Smith, Gardner, Lloyd, Dickson"
5170,2020-09-01 04:14:09,ikdej7,"**Definites** would be :

Cavarra

Wood

Greene

Trengove

Jong

Duryea

Hayes


**Likely:**

Khamis

Sweet

Lloyd

Young

And possibly Gardner (pls don't shoot me but feels like it)

**Unlikely:**

Smith

Lynch

Porter

Gowers

**Likely to retire:**

Dickson

**Have no fucking clue:**

Suckers."
5171,2020-09-01 05:27:09,ikdej7,"I think it's too late for the AFL to change list sizes so I'm assuming the same amount of spots will be open next year.

Ben Cavarra: **Yes**. I don't understand why he was dropped but to me he's coming along nicely in a position of need. If he can work on whatever he was dropped for he's easily our best small forward. 2 year deal

Billy Gowers: **No**. He's been given plenty of chance this year and has failed to show anything. Very clearly not improving or not in our best side so hard to see a place for him. Delist

Brad Lynch: **No**. Unfortunate but two seasons of not getting a call up has to be a bad sign. A big what if. Delist

Buku Khamis: **Yes**. Almost impossible to say what the club are thinking here but he was always going to take a while and it's sounding like he's really started to improve this year. 50/50 call. Re-rookie

Callum Porter: **Yes**. Another tough one but getting his debut this year is a good sign. He might've gotten more if not for his injury. Good clubman, worth keeping just for that. 1 year deal

Easton Wood: **Yes**. Best 22, good leader. Just 1 year deals for here on out in case of injuries or a rapid decline in form. 

Fergus Greene: **Yes**. Named in the bests in scratch matches for the past few weeks. Injuries have made it difficult but I think he's rated enough to get a go. 1 year deal, or 2 year deal if he gets a game in the next few matches.

Jackson Trengove: **Yes**. Another tough call. Extremely well liked, good depth in a few positions, but what's the point of depth if we're not going to keep him. If he gets any interest from other clubs he'll take it immediately to get a game but otherwise surely he takes the 1 year deal just to keep the money coming in.

Jordon Sweet: **No**. Beveridge doesn't sound like a fan. Might get interest from another club, might just be kicked out, but if he's not getting a go now I'm not sure it's happening. Will probably make way for mature ruck depth.

Lachie Young: **Yes**. Eventual Wood replacement. Like Williams last year has gotten games in not his best position just because they think he's good enough for a game but not good enough to push out a defender. He'll get there. 2 year deal

Lin Jong: **Yes**. Another tough one but probably gets a game every time he's fit and is well liked. 1 year deal due to chronic injuries.

Matt Suckling: **No**. Well, at least I'm hoping. He's on the decline, has been pushed out of defence, and is just alright forward of centre. Bevo loves him so it's possible.

Roarke Smith: **No**. I thought he might be the future of our wing but if he didn't get a go when Hunter was out he's probably not in our future plans. Shame, I like the pressure he brings.

Ryan Gardner: **Yes**. I'm one of the few that don't hate the sight of him but it doesn't matter what I think. The coaches like him. 2 year deal.

Sam Lloyd: **No**. Very, very tough. Dickson played 17 games last year and got a 1 year deal at the last minute. Just based on that I'm not sure how Lloyd gets a deal based on a much much worse year. 

Taylor Duryea: **Yes**. Beveridge has flagged him as still in our 22. I'm not sure how he fits with our surplus of defenders but either way he's still getting a contract. 2 years

Tory Dickson: **No**. Again, reasonable last year and only got a deal last minute. No way they can turn around and give him a deal based on this season. Not the way I want to see one of the best forwards in our history (yes I think of him that highly) go out.

Will Hayes: **Yes**. Getting games end of season can be a good sign, especially if he continues to actually play fairly well. 2 year deal.

So 7 list spots free. Young elevated to the main list, Khamis re-rookied. Trade in two players, probably a mature ruck and a half back or something. Draft 3, rookie 1 and either go into next year one list spot short or pick something up in the pre-season draft."
5172,2020-09-01 05:23:54,ikdej7,"This is my copypasta from a thread with my mates, they’re basically the players that would have question marks over them:

- Suckling - gone
- Young - trade or keep
- Trengove - gone
- Schache - trade or keep
- Sweet - who fucking knows
- McLean - keep otherwise too many outs with trades etc
- Lloyd - 1 year
- Gowers - gone
- Porter - shit, get rid of him
- Dickson - finished
- Greene - 🤷🏻‍♂️
- Hayes - unsure
- Lynch - gone obviously
- Duryea- keep if fit
- Gardner - fuck him off but they won’t"
5173,2020-09-01 05:10:12,ikdej7,"Yes to new contracts:
Cavarra
Lynch
Khamis
Wood
Young
Jong
Suckers
Lloyd
Hayes

No:
Gowers
Porter
Duryea
Dickson (sorry Dicko)

Don't know:
Greene
Trengove
Sweet
Smith
Gardner"
5174,2020-09-02 05:11:45,ikdej7,"I'd pay someone to take Gowers.

Dickson and potentially Suckling and Lloyd to retire. Gowers, R Smith, Lynch to be booted. Another club to get in Sweet's ear saying they'll give him regular senior games as second ruck. Gardner and Porter to stick around because they seem well liked, even if we don't get why."
5175,2020-09-01 04:19:45,ikdej7,"I’m really surprised you think Trengove is a definite. If he’s not getting a game this year, I don’t see why he would nest year. I hope another club takes him on though because he deserves better."
5176,2020-09-01 04:37:39,ikdej7,"I would move Jong,  Trengove, Duryea and Hayes to Likely. Wood might retire as well. I think there is a surprising amount of room for list turnover, but I don't think there will end up being that much. There are quite a few on that list who might want to try their luck elsewhere as well, since they're outside our best 22 but still maybe good enough to be on a list.

Whether or not Gardner signs on might depend on what Wood does. Not much defensive depth if Wood retires."
5177,2020-09-01 04:57:51,ikdej7,"I don't think we will lose any defenders this year and I feel like the only reason Jong doesn't go on is if he puts his body first because he is generally in the 22 when fit. Meanwhile I think we have another year or two out of Easton, Duryea and Trengove. Hayes I can understand why he wouldn't be definite. I see Wood staying on a year two specifically because it will help the development of Cody Raak after we pick him up this year."
5178,2020-09-01 06:37:48,ikdej7,"Before Jong had all the injury issues, he was definitely best 22 when fit. Now though, with guys like Smith, Richards, Vandermeer, Wallis coming back into vogue... I have to wonder where he fits in, who he forces out. It's tough, but that's footy. He might look to move on, as much as it pains me to say it."
5179,2020-09-01 07:15:20,ikdej7,"I would have to look at our team and then decide. I would definitely take him over Richards, there are probably a couple of others. He just offers a lot more versatility than a lot of other players, he is also a harder player and good tackler. Plus despite his injuries his speed and leap has deteriorated."
5180,2020-09-01 07:30:36,ikdej7,"I think overall he is a better player than Richards, however I also don't think he has Richards pace. I'm not sure if it's better to pick a player who has better pace, or a slow player with more to offer elsewhere. We have a few of both types of player, so it's a pretty tough selection decision."
5181,2020-09-01 07:36:29,ikdej7,"Richards is our fastest player. But Jong isn't slow and is bigger and offers a lot more than just possibly being a winger. He trained with the defenders in the pre-season, is a good mark up forward, both leading and contested. But would also allow Bevo to play him in the ruck, which he has, and let's Dunks and Macrae off in that regard."

You're stacked; outside Wentz is shitting the bed and Lock being injured. Ideally, you would love to have a better WR 2 but whatever. You made the right calls value wise. 

2 real options; yolo for someone young and undervalued like Goff and take the good with the bad. That would give you Wentz, Goff, Lock which isn't ideal but gives options based on your draft picks remaining. Or.. try to chase a temporary fix, say a vet, until Lock or Wentz figure it out. Allowing you to use those 2's to grab a WR upgrade"
5241,2020-10-09 23:50:33,j8a0z7,Yeah thought I gave up a lot but was getting impatient. Def having a little regret on it but in the long run I hope those picks end up late and the 2nds I used for the other trades as well.

5246,2020-10-10 00:10:43,j8a0z7,Yeah I think having Mahomes helps me deal with a bad qb2 and hope for the best but it feels impossible to find a person willing to trade one. I was going to offer Mixon and Akers for DK and Tua and see if he’d pull the trigger on that. WR2 I’m hoping Diontae can be that guy for me but I don’t wanna have unrealistic expectations for him.
5247,2020-10-10 00:29:57,j8a0z7,Please. All of these trades were taco league trades and you're worried that you did bad?
5248,2020-10-09 23:52:54,j8a0z7,"Darnold looks like he’s on his way out of the league and Mike Williams can’t stay healthy for 4 years, you get a buy low on Wentz and a 2nd 

Then you send Corey Davis (!!!) and two seconds for Swift a top 6 rookie pick and Jarvis Landry who is a top 25 WR mainstay?? 

These are all mostly one sided"
5249,2020-10-10 00:54:37,j8a0z7,"Diontae is a solid WR3 but this isn't his breakout year and then he's going to need to deal with a new QB so everything should point towards WR3 or flex play moving forward. 

You're not having the best year stats wise but you have the pieces now you just need luck."

He could’ve gotten better for it but I don’t think he was getting much offers. Also this was after the game where swift got like %8 snap count."

I'm going to stop you right there"
5254,2020-10-09 20:33:08,j86pih,Love how you casually leave out Jamison Crowder
5255,2020-10-09 20:33:44,j86pih,Denzel Mims plays for The Jets. I think he’s coming off two hamstring injuries too. If your league is super deep then I guess. But I generally never roster a player from the Jets. I do enough damage to myself watching them every week.
5256,2020-10-09 20:38:43,j86pih,"Lol nah. I’m a Jets fan and just...nah.

He’s not even practicing yet so I don’t think he’ll be activated soon and even when he is, I would still be wary. He hurt both of his hammies before the season even started so who knows how he’ll even look when he comes back."
5257,2020-10-09 20:43:28,j86pih,"People dismiss some of these posts because of the bad teams these players are on, but garbage time wins championship.

Guaranteed most people have some garbage at the end of their bench. Doesnt hurt to stay ahead of the wire and just throw a high upside guy at the end of your bench. If it doesn't workout then nbd."
5258,2020-10-09 20:45:54,j86pih,"If you have an IR space to waste it's worth it. Crowder is a thing and he'll continue to be a target hog, but Mims will get plenty of targets once he's even remotely healthy. 

They have a nice stretch of games from week 8-13:

KC
NE
MIA
BYE
MIA
LV

which he will hopefully be healthy for. 

I don't think he's going to blow anyone away from the start, but he should still be a situational flex you can get for free and roster for free if you have the IR space."
5259,2020-10-09 21:56:17,j86pih,"Better player comp is Troy Williamson (sorry for the PTSD Vikings fans) than Chris Godwin. Godwin runs crisper routes. Think he will have better hands than Williamson. I hate where he has ended up because as I have seen Gase as a HC outside receivers don’t develop. Mims is a split end or flanker. He doesn’t have the skills for slot and Crowder and Berrios have the locked up right now.

With that said hell yeah I am stashing him in my 16 team league. He has a complete outside game and has steadily improved through college despite the perception of being a combine darling. One sign that there might be room for him in the offense was that Jeff Smith was able to emerge against Denver. If he has proven himself to get a starting role over Smith and/or Perriman on the perimeter he could fit in if the trend of attacking down field continues for Darnold. Even with Flacco I think he would be a hit or miss starter depending on if that offensive line is able to block well enough to allow his routes to mature.

Something about his circumstances reminds me of OBJs rookie breakout... perhaps this is more than likely me being hopeful and getting my hopes up, but he has a great combination of skills to make an impact now as a rookie with much skepticism based on his team situation."
5260,2020-10-09 21:09:29,j86pih,Would you rather stash Mims or Paris Campbell
5261,2020-10-10 00:33:08,j86pih,Two words : Adam Gase.
5262,2020-10-09 20:30:54,j86pih,What team does he play for again? There’s your answer.
5263,2020-10-09 21:24:30,j86pih,"Mims still has a long way to go. As a Jets fan (haha fuck me right?!) he still can't cut or open up his stride without feeling something there per reports. Deep stash, but Gase is also an idiot. Jets are so bad I don't see them risking too much of him since he's had issues since camp."
5264,2020-10-09 21:33:40,j86pih,yeah get you a piece of that high-powered Jets offense!!
5265,2020-10-09 20:43:00,j86pih,Sometimes I think people who post here don’t actually know how to play fantasy football.
5266,2020-10-09 20:38:05,j86pih,Who is his coach?  I’ll consider this when that changes.
5267,2020-10-09 20:41:53,j86pih,"He's had 0 training camp reps and he is still not over his double hamstring injury after a 3 week IR stint.  

 But he is on a tanking team so he will get every opportunity to show what he has for the future.  You can easily wait unless it's like a 16 team 3WR league or something."
5268,2020-10-09 20:47:09,j86pih,Lol
5269,2020-10-09 21:50:07,j86pih,"nah, not this year at least. crowder and bell are gonna be the only two FF relevant players on that roster this year"
5270,2020-10-09 21:59:29,j86pih,What was his injury? Ankle?
5271,2020-10-09 22:46:46,j86pih,Got him on my IR. Big dude.
5272,2020-10-09 23:25:04,j86pih,"Loved this guy before the draft. I think he has loads of potential, but I felt bad for him when I saw he got drafted to the Jets."
5273,2020-10-09 23:50:08,j86pih,No Jets for me man I’m out on any and all Jets players.
5274,2020-10-10 00:20:45,j86pih,Grab him as soon as he is activated?  How shitty do you think our teams are that we all have someone on our rosters we'd happily drop for this lottery ticket dude who plays for the Jets?
5275,2020-10-09 21:55:01,j86pih,No ❤️
5276,2020-10-09 21:23:22,j86pih,"He has all the opportunity in the world. That was a big selling point for Reagor before he got hurt. However, the knock on Mims in the draft was that he was in a simplified college offense for WRs and was a high ceiling projection that could take a couple years."
5277,2020-10-10 00:24:51,j86pih,Yup. Jets is the beginning and end. Unless it’s dynasty I’d stay away lol
5278,2020-10-09 22:55:51,j86pih,Fantasy football production is all about talent and opportunity. He has both.  Higgins just as good but he was 3rd on the depth chart
5279,2020-10-09 20:38:45,j86pih,"Crowder good, he will definitely still get targets but he needs help"
5280,2020-10-09 20:39:47,j86pih,Who?
5281,2020-10-10 01:55:41,j86pih,"seriously, dude has prolly had 1 week of practice tops. injured one hamstring and then immediately hurt the other one as soon as he came back"
5282,2020-10-10 13:42:58,j86pih,Garbage time is where it’s at.
5283,2020-10-10 02:46:51,j86pih,...did you just call a stretch of games that include a bye week and the NE secondary a nice stretch?
5284,2020-10-10 00:35:43,j86pih,The only problem with Troy Williamson being a better comp is that I have never heard of him
5285,2020-10-09 23:52:08,j86pih,[deleted]
5286,2020-10-09 20:51:01,j86pih,This argument is essentially nullified for those who can stash him on IR for free right now. S/o my GMs who stashed OBJ rookie year after a 5 week hamstring issue. A situation much like Mims.
5287,2020-10-09 21:33:09,j86pih,This was the arguement against Jrob fwiw
5288,2020-10-09 20:32:33,j86pih,So you’re saying adding him will Jet us to the top of the league standings? I’m sold.
5289,2020-10-09 20:59:03,j86pih,Everyone out there is a WR3 with WR2 potential.
5290,2020-10-09 20:44:39,j86pih,"Ah yes famously not injury-prone and reliable WR, Jamison Crowder."
5291,2020-10-10 02:26:55,j86pih,Saving those hamstrings for Trevor Lawrence.
5292,2020-10-10 07:40:12,j86pih,KC no joke
5293,2020-10-10 00:53:04,j86pih,"Very similar measurables. Was taken 7th overall by the Vikings in 2005. Vikings were looking to replace Randy Moss, but that is something you don’t simply do. However his film from South Carolina showed a monster that could high point balls and win over the top with 4.32 speed.

He came into the NFL and dropped a ton of balls with plenty of them being important... and thrown on the money. He was off the Vikings after 2007. He spent 2008 and 2009 with the Jags before bouncing out of the league."
5294,2020-10-09 23:53:51,j86pih,"Well........ I was deciding between these two, but some taco just dropped Chubb. 

Putting a claim in for him and hoping the couple people before me didn’t notice. 

Love tacos."
5295,2020-10-09 21:44:40,j86pih,"I stashed Odell that year, but my league didn’t have IR. Gave a roster spot to a rookie I didn’t really know because I liked his name. Worked out fine."
5296,2020-10-09 21:45:25,j86pih,Exactly what I think. Doubt he will match OBJs rookie season but could be solid
5297,2020-10-09 21:09:25,j86pih,Would you rather stash Mims or Paris Campbell ?
5298,2020-10-09 23:11:29,j86pih,But who in COVID football era has an IR spot that they can fill for untold weeks until he even starts practicing? You pick him up you’re probably dropping him when you need that spot long before he’s playable.
5299,2020-10-09 22:45:47,j86pih,"Every single team has a fantasy producer. It's how this shit works. Someone will eventually produce even if its at a flex level.

Even the worst offense of the modern era, the Josh Rosen Cardinals had a borderline RB1 in David Johnson.

I genuinely can't remember an offense where no one was playable. Maybe thats the Giants this year but I think in a few weeks we will know who will be their primary player, whether it be Engram or Freeman or Slayton"
5300,2020-10-09 21:08:22,j86pih,"I don’t even know what you’re insinuating here. 

Crowder has been a PPR machine since he signed with the Jets. Weirdly enough."
5301,2020-10-09 21:58:25,j86pih,Same. I didn’t know him either but I remember how mad Coughlin was in a press conference when a reporter asked about him. I figured Coughlin isn’t the type to hype a rookie and if he’s visibly upset at his absence then this guy must be good. He was...
5302,2020-10-09 21:14:07,j86pih,Parris isn’t expected to return until after his week 7 bye. I think Mims is back sooner but who knows. If either are your WR5 I’d say it’s a slight edge for Parris since he’s proven.
5303,2020-10-09 23:31:34,j86pih,"Picked up and dropped Mims once already. This doesn’t deter me as he’s my WR5. Due to covid + injuries, there are weekly opportunities for a practice squad guy to give you a serviceable 10-12 ppg (volume and opportunity based). So, I’d argue WR options are even deeper this year. The difference with Mims is primarily draft capital and talent. He’ll get healthy and most likely be #2 in targets behind Crowder. However, he has the ability to break out for a very high ceiling like some of his rookie WR classmates already have. The investment risk is low and if you are looking for a WR3/4 need...he’s not your guy.

For perspective, 70% of my 14 team league holds 2 QBs and 2 TEs. These are streamable positions. I’ve already lost 3 of the staring WRs I drafted. I expect to lose more players. My whole strategy this year is to avoid that dead space and instead of those 2 spots being used for backups, I use for lotto picks that I rotate. This week it’s McFarland and Mims. My bye week rosters are planned out thru week 11 so I know my exact flexibility. Sorry for the novel."
5304,2020-10-09 21:28:43,j86pih,"Game logs 2019:

- 17 targets week 1
- Games 2-16 after: 6 games with 3 receptions or less. 7 games with 29 yards receiving or less.

Screams boom or bust WR3 not a “PPR machine.” This is Great Value brand Jarvis Landry.

*straight up math/facts is getting downvoted for not fitting a narrative."
5305,2020-10-09 21:15:41,j86pih,"I don’t need either right now, i have a pretty decent wr Corp in that league, just taking a stash on a possible sleeper."
5306,2020-10-09 23:43:14,j86pih,"I feel your pain. Been in a 16-team league for like eight or nine years now. Any WW/FA pickup who provides real value is a gem.

Unfortunately, we don’t have IR spots (I’m in a smaller keeper league that does have one) — if we added 16 extra roster spots it would be hard even finding anything, including a defense for a bye week, available — and I’m already holding CMC right now so until that resolves itself I can’t add any dead wood."
5307,2020-10-09 22:41:55,j86pih,"Some major bias in the statistics you gave us there bud. He was the 19th most targeted player in 2019 and had the 24th most receptions. He only had 7 games with less than 7 targets, including 3 games in which Sam Darnold didn’t play, and only two games with less than 5 targets, 1 of which Darnold didn’t play in. The fact that he has even seen double digit targets of 17 or close to it multiple times puts him on a very small list of receivers with names that I won’t even attempt to compare Crowder too. My point is he has WR 2 or better upside regardless of how you feel about the Jets with one of the best flex floors out there. He’s dealt with a lot of bad QB play throughout his career, but has always been among the more targeted pass catchers in the league for a reason. Not only is he the best pass catcher they have, he’s been that talented and targeted like that since he played in Washington, so I have a ton of confidence in Crowder as one of the higher end flex plays out there and far from the worst WR 2 you could have. He’s a very good floor guy."
5308,2020-10-09 22:04:38,j86pih,"yep, too many people caught in hoping he is what he was and not what he currently is."
5309,2020-10-09 22:56:56,j86pih,"I actually agree with you because your long post is basically extrapolating the “Boom” part of his profile.

My stats earlier were detailing the “Bust” part of his profile.

Crowder is remarkably consistent at displaying this boom-or-bust fantasy profile going back to Washington.

The reality is he’s [insert Gase slot guy] for now, pending his health upholding, QB situation will be stable (Darnold already hurt again, just like last year), and he has a career season that bucks all of his historical splits."
5310,2020-10-09 22:20:20,j86pih,"Currently he has 23 targets, 14 receptions, 219 yards and a TD in 2 games."
5311,2020-10-09 22:34:25,j86pih,"His career best is 52 yards per game, which he has accomplished 3x (inc.  last year).

Again, he’s about as boom or bust a WR3 as you’ll ever see and he’s proven it throughout his career. 

But if you ignore all his history and regression to mean theory, Crowder is a no doubt solid PPR machine with Flacco going forward, on pace for 1600+ yards receiving and 180+ targets!!!"
5312,2020-10-09 23:06:02,j86pih,"My point is that he still has a lot of value and isn’t as bust as you make him out to be, Crowder could make or break a good trade for me. Nobody should have been drafting Crowder expecting him to be a WR 1 and if you have to start him as your WR 2 due to injury than you have a better option then a good amount of people that i’ve seen. I don’t trust any receiver on that team except for him, they just don’t have any good QB play and Crowder is the only one with real experience on that front. Plus if anybody should see more volume in the passing game it’s Leveon now that he’s back. If Mims was really gonna make a splash, I think he would have already did it with probably the 2nd best overall pass catcher they have on IR."
5313,2020-10-09 23:18:34,j86pih,"I agree with you in lots of ways because we’re being realistic about the range of outcomes with Crowder.

Mainly I can agree with him as a safe play, but usually the point of OPs post is about stashing high upside plays. No one stashes Crowder and he is certainly not a league winner/PPR machine the guy above said he is."
5314,2020-10-09 23:23:43,j86pih,"I probably won’t be seeking out Mims, but he definitely could prove me wrong. Fantasy lottery tickets can’t ever be guaranteed to be a loser or a winner, it’s all speculation at the end of the day."
5315,2020-10-09 22:40:47,j83cdp,Hey thanks for the insight we agree on a lot of plays. Are you avoiding the Clemson um and Alabama Vs ole miss game I loved Rodgers from Clemson and metchie from bama but the rain is supposed to be pretty bad. Also I think turner for pit is a sneaky play if Addison out
5316,2020-10-10 14:46:52,j83cdp,McGowan out for OU

Those 2 games are my favorites on the late slate, looks like weather is gonna play a big factor tonight! Most players won't look at weather so that's gonna be a big advantage tonight."
5318,2020-10-10 15:21:50,j83cdp,"I'm confidently pivoting to Pledger in my lineups where I had McGowan. Tank Bigsby would be another option, but Pledger has enormous upside with McGowan out."

5475,2020-10-09 19:24:17,j7xwav,And not a single Dembele. I wonder if the various small spelling/accent variations kept them out.
5476,2020-10-10 10:57:37,j7xwav,"That's because there is a lot of variety in French names, while people of African descent/English/Germans have less variety in their names"

5480,2020-10-09 15:03:30,j7xwav,"During Franquism all names had to be from the santoral (is what you get with a catholic church ran dictatorship). So for males you had a myriad of Jose or Jesus + another saint and for women Maria + another name.

5502,2020-10-09 19:00:58,j7xwav,"It is - It’s more than 20,000 people in Germany named Thomas Müller. there is even a movie about this phenomenon *Who is Thomas Müller* which tries to find the average German (and of course features the most prominent one as well).

5503,2020-10-09 17:36:11,j7xwav,I wonder if there was a spike in baby’s named that during WC years especially in 2010
5504,2020-10-09 15:28:19,j7xwav,Or one blacksmith had a big hammer

5531,2020-10-09 21:11:18,j7xwav,"Yep. You can tell because ""iron"" in Latin is ""ferro"", so naturally Ferraro and Ferrari would be smithing. Pretty much any common last name in any Western language has something to do with a profession or father's name. The Russian last name ""Kuznetsov"" on this list means ""smith"" as well"
5532,2020-10-09 20:12:17,j7xwav,This is kind of disappointing

5602,2020-11-12 09:16:10,j7d7i0,Updated. However AFL.com.au indicated Jacob Koschitzke was also without a deal two weeks ago. Must have offered him since.
5603,2020-10-12 15:56:09,j7d7i0,I don't know the ins and out of AFL trades but I just assumed your new club took on your old contract. Seems odd to trade for him and them give him a one year deal. But that's what the internet is telling me.
5604,2020-10-09 04:45:12,j7d7i0,I don't get why Morrison is the punching bag for a lot of people. I think he's decent
5605,2020-10-09 05:02:14,j7d7i0,I'm the other way round. I think morrison as more potential in the midfield than Howe. I like Howe because he is a hard nut. But if Morrison can recapture his form from season of 2018 he could be our next Smith. And CJ is getting better every game he plays
5606,2020-10-09 07:43:31,j7d7i0,"I think Daniel Howe is seriously under-rated as a tagger. It hasn't been the same with his injuries in the last two seasons where we've had to use Shiels or somebody else to tag.

Morrison always seems composed on the ball, which I like, perhaps more time in the Sicily role at half-back whilst he's off hurt would do him some good.

CJ is just very raw, which is what you want from a Cat B rookie."
5607,2020-10-09 05:04:55,j7d7i0,I think he's pushing himself too hard to do more which isn't what made him awesome in 2018. His ability to find space and hit targets at full speed. Was exactly what we lost when Hill went to freo
5608,2020-10-08 14:22:30,j7cpjq,Why was it taken off spotify?
5609,2020-10-08 14:23:06,j7cpjq,What do you mean?

5612,2020-10-08 17:58:26,j7cp1i,"No disrespect here, because I appreciate you putting forth the effort to explain your reasoning for each pick and giving this sub some material to engage in... but there is 0% chance that Trevor Lawrence doesn't go #1 over all. If the Giants were to lock up that pick (I think it will be the jets) you bet your bottom dollar that they move on from Jones and continue the rebuild around Lawrence, trading Jones for an early-mid round pick. I agree that Jones doesn't have the best supporting cast at the moment, but there's just no way that a team who is bad enough to fall to #1 overall doesn't take the best QB prospect in a decade."
5613,2020-10-08 19:51:37,j7cp1i,"> Washington needs to provide Dwayne Haskins Jr. with weapons if they want a productive passing game.

Who wants to tell him"
5614,2020-10-08 14:46:19,j7cp1i,You are fucking HIGH if you think the Giants pass up on Lawrence.
5615,2020-10-08 14:15:00,j7cp1i,"I think whether or not Humphrey at 12 is proper value is certainly up for debate, but I absolutely agree with the logic. I don't see any way we re-sign Elflein, and Dozier and Samia have been underwhelming to say the least.

I see your logic with CIN passing on OL at 13, but I think Cosmi, Leatherwood, and the two OSU iOL might be of value depending on who you ask at this point. I see Davis wouldn't even be that much of a reach. You have him gone at 16. The CIN OL is so bad that I don't think it would hurt too much for them to reach on a guy.

I'm not sure NO spends a pick on a TE. They just traded four picks to move up for Adam Trautman. He's only gotten 34 yards, but he's been stuck behind Cook who is a top 10-15 TE when healthy, and he hasn't looked bad by any means. But it certainly might make sense if they're planning to move to more 2TE sets after the departure of Brees.

>All three of Cleveland's starters on the IOL are incredible, but their contracts also expire within the next three years.

While this is technically true, I think GMs generally plan three years at a time. Why would I draft Myers to sit on my bench for two years when instead I could have a rotational pass rusher or add depth to my CB corps, two groups where backups actually see time?

I think Tufele to PIT might make sense somewhat, but they have far more important needs. Their DL is the best in the league, even without Alualu. At OL, however, they only have 3 starters signed through 2021 and none signed through 2022. They also possess one of the oldest OL groups in the league between DeCastro (30), Pouncey (31), and Al (32)

I don't think Pitts makes much sense to TEN either unless they plan on employing more 2TE sets than they currently are. Jonnu Smith has played better than any TE not named Kelce through 4 games, and I'd argue he is the most important player on that offense other than Henry. I think an outside WR makes much more sense.

Overall as always, appreciate the quality of the work and time and effort it takes into doing this every week. These are just some of my nitpicks. Keep at it."
5616,2020-10-08 13:47:38,j7cp1i,I don’t care what your reasoning is a guard to the Browns with their defense in the state it’s in is indefensible.
5617,2020-10-08 14:27:05,j7cp1i,"You really missed the top 2 picks here, both the giants and falcons will take Lawrence if available."
5618,2020-10-08 17:58:37,j7cp1i,The idea of Houston trading 2 firsts for a franchise left tackle knowing that they could just draft Sewell on a rookie contract with one of those and keep the other and also keep Hopkins is kinda hilarious. I’m sorry Texans fans.
5619,2020-10-08 17:38:07,j7cp1i,"IOL is like the last of what Cleveland needs right now. I would say in order:

LB, S, Edge, CB, WR3.

Honestly, IOL would probably be in the bottom 3. We have 3 years left (as you mentioned) to figure that out. We already have our C of the future in Nick Harris behind Tretter, and we will more than likely resign Teller at some point. That leaves Bitonio needing replaced, but we have way to many holes to draft someone in the 1st and have them ride the bench for 2-3 years. Hamsah or Hutchinson would make way more sense.

Also, Lawrence is going #1 no matter what lol."
5620,2020-10-08 17:58:04,j7cp1i,"I'd go Wyatt Davis, because our iOL is also bad, and Bobby Hart merely distracts from that. If we're set on reciever, I'd go with Moore, as we could use someone that can take the top off a defense"
5621,2020-10-08 18:26:33,j7cp1i,I'm not passing on Trevor or Chase. I don't care what team you are.
5622,2020-10-08 18:12:40,j7cp1i,As an OSU/Lions fan I really want Fields. Stafford is not looking great this year and we’re likely looking at a rebuild next year
5623,2020-10-08 21:30:56,j7cp1i,Why are the Jets willing to move on from Darnold but the Giants arent from Jones?
5624,2020-10-08 15:59:41,j7cp1i,I'm the Carolina Panthers and I approve this message
5625,2020-10-08 17:59:00,j7cp1i,Just not realistic for linebacker at 1 or guy with one good season at edge at 2.
5626,2020-10-08 17:01:32,j7cp1i,"I don’t follow your logic for the first pick. The giants pass on a QB because Jones hasn’t had the weapons to prove himself, but pass on jamar chase for parsons."
5627,2020-10-08 14:26:46,j7cp1i,Barmore a solid pick for us our top 3 IDL are all FAs and Guy is aging
5628,2020-10-08 14:51:07,j7cp1i,"I lean toward Waddle over Bateman but would be completely happy with either. That said, if an EDGE like Kwity Paye, Carlos Basham or Aidan Hutchinson is available I'd much rather take one of those guys, pass rush is *by far* this team's biggest hole."
5629,2020-10-08 18:05:34,j7cp1i,[deleted]
5630,2020-10-08 18:25:50,j7cp1i,"I just don't see S as a need for the Colts at all. Blackmon and Willis are both playing well, and they've got 2+ years of rookie contract left each. Biggest needs on defense (imo) are DE and CB, and even those positions are smaller needs that what we need on offense (WR, QB, LT of the future)."
5631,2020-10-08 18:36:01,j7cp1i,If #1 pick doesn't want a QB it will get traded for a haul and in some weird world where that doesn't happen (AKA this no trade mock) NO WAY an ILB goes 1 overall. But the Giants did draft a RB at #2 so you never know
5632,2020-10-08 19:13:20,j7cp1i,"Calling Cody Ford pedestrian at RG is a bit off for me. He's a pedestrian tackle but a force at guard. He is an improvement over Spain and would start in Spain's stead in your example line. I don't dislike drafting a tackle, though."
5633,2020-10-08 19:15:26,j7cp1i,"Cool to read about, good work! I can't imagine NY taking a linebacker first overall, though. I don't think we'll see anything beyond a QB or lineman there for a while and Giants easily could use Sewell if they don't go QB. For the Packers, I'd be upset if they took D yet again in the first round especially at ILB where the team continues to show they don't value highly."
5634,2020-10-08 19:47:21,j7cp1i,Finally a mock that makes sense for the Patriots. Bravo!
5635,2020-10-08 20:34:38,j7cp1i,"Absolutely love the pick for LV. We have glaring needs but with an old Incognito and underperforming Gabe Jackson, iOL would be the way to go."
5636,2020-10-08 22:01:02,j7cp1i,Packers going LB or D Line is basically what I expect right now out of them so no problems here
5637,2020-10-09 03:38:06,j7cp1i,"Not too sure about the top 3 in the draft. But, I respect the time and energy OP put into this Mock."
5638,2020-10-08 19:02:01,j7cp1i,"Lol half the reason I check these is to claim people have Buffalo picking too early but nope, you nailed it."
5639,2020-10-08 14:29:28,j7cp1i,"Just so you know Ford has been playing LG and has actually been playing really well.  OT isn’t out of the question, but it wouldn’t be because they are moving Williams to guard.  If they resign him (which they should) he’s staying at tackle.  CB and Edge are much bigger needs."
5640,2020-10-08 17:58:39,j7cp1i,"IDL is one of the last needs we have. We have incredible depth there.

We need LT, C, possibly QB, and definitely ILB."
5641,2020-10-08 19:31:45,j7cp1i,"OT is not the only issue the Bengals have on the O-Line. PFF has our worst starting linemen as LG Michael Jordan and RG Alex Redmond. If Wyatt Davis was available at 13, they need him."
5642,2020-10-08 20:54:07,j7cp1i,My only solace for the Bears is that we'll definitely slide up in draft position as the season goes on (if it goes on) and hopefully be in striking distance of a QB. Because the Bears are absolutely required to draft one in 2021.
5643,2020-10-08 21:23:50,j7cp1i,"The Giants linebackers have been fine, they need O line."
5644,2020-10-09 01:31:01,j7cp1i,"I like the Eagles pick, but Maddox is a fine player. He’s capable of starting at free safety or slot corner, but even still he’s adequate as a second outside corner as long as the defensive line is generating consistent pressure."
5645,2020-10-09 02:00:22,j7cp1i,"CB is definitely a need for the Eagles, but so is WR and I think Waddle would be too good to pass up at 19, and I think Bateman would deserve some consideration as well"
5646,2020-10-09 07:50:10,j7cp1i,"The Packers may have struck gold with UDFA Krys Barnes, who is currently the #20 LB according to PFF through 4 games and their #5 defensive rookie. The team also hasn't had a chance to see 5th round pick Kamal Martin in a game yet, after he was making daily headlines during training camp. They may have already found their long term answers at the position at this rate, which would eliminate ILB as a position of need in 2021.

Right now I'd put DL and CB as the top two needs for the Packers."
5647,2020-10-09 12:12:12,j7cp1i,"Really don't think Marvin Wilson is that special.
Shouldn't go in the top 10. Just my opinion"
5648,2020-10-11 04:45:31,j7cp1i,I think Pitts is gonna shoot up the boards. He's going top 15 imo
5649,2020-10-11 14:42:39,j7cp1i,It's time move Pitts to TE 1 hes just that good.
5650,2020-10-12 15:12:59,j7cp1i,"I’m more than sure that Robinson won’t be replaced with an early pick in this draft. You would have to go either TE, IDL, or CB with that other first round pick."
5651,2020-10-08 17:01:07,j7cp1i,If the giants are keeping Jones they will draft chase. He needs someone to throw to and right now all his options are similar versions of the same WR2.
5652,2020-10-08 19:11:05,j7cp1i,"I just don't see any situation where Trevor Lawrence doesn't go at number one. If the team with the first pick doesn't need a quarterback, they'll surely trade back for a haul of picks."
5653,2020-10-08 20:17:41,j7cp1i,Honestly what’s the point of these mocks where Trevor isn’t going #1.
5654,2020-10-08 21:08:55,j7cp1i,"I’m gonna be the 15th person to criticize your mock and for that I’m sorry because I know these take time, but in absolutely no universe will the WFT take anything but a QB if they’re in the top 10. 

Haskins tenure is officially done with them moving on to Allen. I have absolutely no hopes of this, BUT if Allen can play to a level where we’re not in the top 10, then maybe there’s a chance we take a player at another position.

For for all intents and purposes, any mock for WFT needs to have a QB in 2021."
5655,2020-10-08 22:25:17,j7cp1i,"I'll cry if we suffer through this miserable season, only get the 10th pick and only take the 3rd best CB."
5656,2020-10-08 22:40:59,j7cp1i,"No disrespect, but this is pretty bad. Sewell is not making it out of the Top 3 and Lawrence is definitely going no. 1 if anyone besides the Bengals, Dolphins, or Chargers are up there at no. 1"
5657,2020-10-09 00:24:22,j7cp1i,if we take a tight end that's not kyle pitts with the tight end named kyle pitts still on the board i'm gonna be fuming
5658,2020-10-09 00:26:27,j7cp1i,"Leatherwood is not a reach @ 13. Also, Waddle would go higher than Smith. And, that is not a position of need for Cincy."
5659,2020-10-08 16:13:38,j7cp1i,"I stopped looking at this article as soon as I saw the first pick.  This article is complete and utter garbage, I feel dumber for even clicking on it."
5660,2020-10-08 16:29:39,j7cp1i,Travis Etienne isn’t falling out of the first.
5661,2020-10-08 18:18:11,j7cp1i,"I don’t understand the idea of Bridgewater losing the job? Like he’s definitely not the same QB he was when he entered the league, but he’s not terrible, and I don’t think the Panthers would give him a $63 million dollar contract just to give up on him this quickly, but that’s just my opinion I guess"
5662,2020-10-08 19:17:06,j7cp1i,This is bad bad.
5663,2020-10-08 19:38:39,j7cp1i,I will be very disappointed if the Giants are drafting 1st and they take anyone other than Lawrence with that pick.
5664,2020-10-08 21:54:20,j7cp1i,"The Packers won’t reach for an ILB when they: 

A. Clearly don’t value the position very highly.

B. Paid Kirksey.

C. 5th round draft choice Kamal Martin was outstanding in camp and was the starter with Kirksey until getting hurt.

D. UFDA Krys Barnes out of UCLA has been PFF’s 5th rated rookie defender through week 5."
5665,2020-10-09 04:04:27,j7cp1i,Why do the Packers have to draft for need?
5666,2020-10-09 11:33:17,j7cp1i,Jets aren't moving on from darnold
5667,2020-10-09 11:35:05,j7cp1i,"Is this your mock draft? Either way it's horrible.
Justin fields won't last that long"
5668,2020-10-14 09:51:57,j7cp1i,"Sewell will be the 1st non-qb off the board.  If the team with the 1st pick isn’t in the market for a qb, They will trade out with someone who loves Lawrence.  LB at 1-1, lol.  Giants would take Sewell, but more than likely trade out.  Micah Parsons 1-1 lol."
5669,2020-10-08 17:52:05,j7cp1i,yeah I want waddle👁👄👁 alabama man catch ball run fast score points!!!!!
5670,2020-10-08 15:02:47,j7cp1i,"Not as spicy as Buffalo picking 32nd, meaning they’re winning the super bowl."
5671,2020-10-08 13:23:13,j7cp1i,"I think the Giants should stick with Danny Dimes and trade back but I'm not doing trades in these mocks so there will be some questionable picks. Don't get me wrong, Lawrence/Sewell is going to be #1 overall if things go as planned. Thanks for the props though, glad some people appreciate the stuff!"
5672,2020-10-08 19:39:39,j7cp1i,For real. Colts get another safety with two big WRs left on the board?
5673,2020-10-08 20:39:32,j7cp1i,Ii think they should just trade back if they end up at 1 but thank you
5674,2020-10-08 20:19:57,j7cp1i,I wrote that before the benching
5675,2020-10-08 15:29:58,j7cp1i,"Agreed. If you have a chance between keeping Daniel Jones and taking Lawrence, you take Lawrence.   


And in an off the field consideration, can you imagine Daniel Jones sucking in the New York market and having Lawrence on the other New York team and tearing it up?"
5676,2020-10-08 17:08:08,j7cp1i,They should honestly trade back
5677,2020-10-08 17:12:21,j7cp1i,Wow thanks for the praise man. People like you keep me going with these mocks
5678,2020-10-08 17:59:18,j7cp1i,This is Corbett 2.0 except much worse. There wouldn't be a spot for him for at least two years
5679,2020-10-09 12:24:16,j7cp1i,"Yeah and with Bashram, Nasirildeen, and Surratt available this is a bad pick. Surratt imo is the best LB of the group after Moses/Parsons and would be the biggest upgrade. Bashram would fill the hole left by OV leaving in FA and while I know we have Delphit, Achilles injuries are often difficult to overcome and are career enders."
5680,2020-10-08 13:48:37,j7cp1i,I literally just defended it in my explanation lmao
5681,2020-10-08 17:11:02,j7cp1i,Giants should trade back if they're at 1 IMO. And we would trade back too. We need to fix our defense so we can contend while Ryan and Julio are still good.
5682,2020-10-08 20:38:34,j7cp1i,"Houston doesn't have a 1st rounder....

EDIT: Sorry my mistake I interpreted that wrong lol"
5683,2020-10-08 20:44:33,j7cp1i,I would have Lawrence going 1 if I were doing trade backs
5684,2020-10-08 18:21:45,j7cp1i,"I agree, I'd assume with having Boyd, Higgins and Tate, as our top 3 WRs (I think personally Tate should get more snaps, as much as I love AJ he just doesn't seem like himself, but it can take him time to get back to game speed as it's only been 4 games back) I would rather see some iOL help as well, or more help on defense."
5685,2020-10-08 20:43:20,j7cp1i,IMO Smith > Moore
5686,2020-10-09 00:45:16,j7cp1i,Plus our guards are worse than our tackles.
5687,2020-10-15 02:36:34,j7cp1i,"Yeah, if the pick is WR I would think they take Waddle or Moore. They don’t need a possession receiver or a tall receiver. They need someone to be what Ross was supposed to be. The lack of respect Boyd gets is pretty alarming."
5688,2020-10-08 20:27:06,j7cp1i,Yes I fully agree but I'm not doing trades
5689,2020-10-09 03:29:33,j7cp1i,"Jets are certainly more likely because they're getting a new HC and most of the time, a new HC = a new QB"
5690,2020-10-08 23:57:37,j7cp1i,You think our biggest need is QB?
5691,2020-10-08 20:28:44,j7cp1i,Yes I fully agree but I'm not doing trades
5692,2020-10-08 17:06:47,j7cp1i,They shouldn't give up on Jones because they haven't set him up to succeed. They should trade back & take Chase but we're not doing trades so they take Parsons because his value is higher than Chase's and they need a LB.
5693,2020-10-08 21:03:46,j7cp1i,I just don't get the Kwity hype
5694,2020-10-08 21:59:26,j7cp1i,"Especially with Kirksey on the roster, Kamal Martin was starting in camp before injury, and Krys Barnes has looked good in limited snaps."
5695,2020-10-08 22:25:57,j7cp1i,"Yup, this one just won't happen. Time again they pass on ILB in the first round. It's still far, far too early but I'm betting a d-lineman will be our target."
5696,2020-10-08 20:28:07,j7cp1i,I would say DT is a need IMO
5697,2020-10-08 20:26:40,j7cp1i,Yes I fully agree but I'm not doing trades
5698,2020-10-08 20:23:21,j7cp1i,Thank you! I would prefer Giants trade back but we're not doing trades
5699,2020-10-08 20:20:12,j7cp1i,Thank you haha
5700,2020-10-08 20:45:39,j7cp1i,Appreciate it. Glad you enjoyed
5701,2020-10-09 03:28:17,j7cp1i,Glad we're on the same page
5702,2020-10-09 12:08:52,j7cp1i,Thank you! Hate it when people just criticize without anything constructive. Glad you enjoyed.
5703,2020-10-08 20:24:59,j7cp1i,This order may be based on current record but I got faith in the Bills!
5704,2020-10-08 17:08:48,j7cp1i,Oh my bad I just went off what ESPN's depth chart said
5705,2020-10-08 20:37:47,j7cp1i,Which team?
5706,2020-10-08 20:57:16,j7cp1i,Still bitter about blowing a lead to you guys :(
5707,2020-10-09 03:26:45,j7cp1i,I feel Waddle is a bit overrated
5708,2020-10-09 12:08:15,j7cp1i,"You do know that the Packers run a 3-4 defense and start two ILBs, right? So an ILB isn't completely out of the question."
5709,2020-10-09 12:14:05,j7cp1i,"Oh I don't think he's top 10 either, more like top 15. But the way the picks fell in this mock, he ended up going top 10."
5710,2020-10-08 17:06:55,j7cp1i,They shouldn't give up on Jones because they haven't set him up to succeed. They should trade back & take Chase but we're not doing trades so they take Parsons because his value is higher than Chase's and they need a LB.
5711,2020-10-08 20:24:08,j7cp1i,Yes I think Giants should trade back in this case but I'm not doing trades
5712,2020-10-08 20:19:27,j7cp1i,First paragraph
5713,2020-10-09 03:30:23,j7cp1i,"If you want WFT to take a QB in the top 10, feel free to make your own mock draft with that scenario"
5714,2020-10-09 03:27:13,j7cp1i,Why do you guys love Waddle so much compared to guys like Smith and Moore
5715,2020-10-08 17:07:39,j7cp1i,Not an article lol
5716,2020-10-09 12:19:50,j7cp1i,Is Teddy taking you on a deep playoff run?
5717,2020-10-08 20:22:18,j7cp1i,Oh no what will I do now?! u/basicnflfan doesn't like my mock!!
5718,2020-10-08 20:20:38,j7cp1i,They should trade back if they are 1st
5719,2020-10-08 22:27:33,j7cp1i,"This. D-lineman makes the most sense given our history, with maybe a WR in the second. Really depends on who is available, though. My early draft crush is Seth Williams and I would love for him to be on the Packers."
5720,2020-10-09 12:06:18,j7cp1i,They can contend for a Super Bowl. What if for some reason Justin Fields fall to them? Are they going to take him? No. They need to draft to fill in needs.
5721,2020-10-09 12:05:18,j7cp1i,Are you the GM?
5722,2020-10-09 12:05:09,j7cp1i,"If you read the first paragraph, you would know whose mock draft it is. And I'm glad you think it's horrible."
5723,2020-10-14 13:28:39,j7cp1i,You should check out the mock I just posted then
5724,2020-10-09 12:12:42,j7cp1i,So you find him a bit overrated too?
5725,2020-10-08 17:14:10,j7cp1i,Did you read what the order was based on
5726,2020-10-08 13:32:40,j7cp1i,[deleted]
5727,2020-10-08 13:43:53,j7cp1i,Definitely unique but I think it's more likely than not that a new GM is doing this draft for the Giants and Jones has been playing just as poorly ad Haskins who just got benched.
5728,2020-10-11 04:41:50,j7cp1i,LB just doesn't have the positional value to go 1 overall even if the Giants stick with their current QB
5729,2020-10-08 17:13:07,j7cp1i,Nope that's a dumb idea.
5730,2020-10-08 21:13:27,j7cp1i,AND pick 22! Kill me!
5731,2020-10-08 20:05:11,j7cp1i,And your defense is flawed and poor. The Browns back seven is paper thin and they have the best interior line in the NFL. Mocking them a guard makes no sense whatsoever.
5732,2020-10-08 22:20:33,j7cp1i,"Your defense was laughable though. “They might need guard help in 2022” is an asinine reason to draft a guard in 2021 when the team is firmly in win now mode.

The Browns have two of the worst safeties in the entire NFL, you had a safety go with the very next pick, what was wrong with that? S, CB, EDGE, DT, even WR would all be drastically better picks than an iOL. Waddle, Bateman, Tufele, the list goes on and on of players who are drastically better fits"
5733,2020-10-08 14:08:08,j7cp1i,We aren't going to resign Chubb so there won't be enough of a cap crunch to lose more than one of the lineman in the near future.
5734,2020-10-08 23:02:04,j7cp1i,"I’m sorry, but if you’re picking 2nd overall, you’re not about to contend for shit"
5735,2020-10-08 21:06:23,j7cp1i,"The dream of contention should mostly be dead for the Falcons. That's not to say we should immediately blow everything up, but I don't think the current roster should influence our pick *that* much. If we have the opportunity to draft Lawrence, we should either take him or demand a king's ransom from another team."
5736,2020-10-08 20:58:31,j7cp1i,"Personally, I dont see a scenario that Lawrence doesnt go #1, trade down or not. If the Giants have the #1 pick, and they choose to ride with Daniel Jones over Trevor Lawrence, they might burn that stadium down"
5737,2020-10-09 00:46:32,j7cp1i,"Not our biggest need, but no one thinks that Bridgewater is capable of making a deep playoff run. I'm not sure that Lance is necessarily the guy to lead us to the playoffs, but Teddy is a B level QB in 2020."
5738,2020-10-08 17:12:52,j7cp1i,That’s fair
5739,2020-10-09 14:11:46,j7cp1i,"Granted at this point it's mostly banking on athletic upside (if the reported testing numbers are true, he's a bona fide freak of nature) but he was solid last year and the potential is very much there. Needs a good showing this year though."
5740,2020-10-09 12:17:23,j7cp1i,Weren't the Packers also not going to trade up for a QB in the 1st round as well? Proves anything is on the table.
5741,2020-10-08 20:30:48,j7cp1i,"Maybe depth, but we've got two young starters playing really well (with Buckner playing like an absolute monster the last three weeks)."
5742,2020-10-08 21:39:40,j7cp1i,"Sorry, Steelers forgot I had no flair,"
5743,2020-10-09 14:34:41,j7cp1i,"The second ILB in the Packers version of the 3-4 plays fewer snaps on defense than the #3 safety. Will Redmond and Raven Greene play more snaps on defense than the #2 ILB, and that is by design. The Packers' base defense is more like a nickel or dime alignment because the priority is to get as much speed on the field as possible to stop the pass and prevent big chunk plays downfield. 

So if the #2 ILB is on the field for maybe 15-20 snaps per game, why does the team need to waste a high pick in order to fill that role? I feel I shouldn't have to explain that after the Packers had a shot at Patrick Queen and Jordan Brooks and passed on both of them for Jordsn Love.

The current depth chart for Green Bay includes Christian Kirksey (who is more of a stopgap anyway and a potential cap casualty in 2021), Krys Barnes, Ty Summers, Kamal Martin, and Oren Burks. As I said earlier, if Barnes and Martin end up becoming reliable players for the duration of this season, I don't see any reason we should spend a high pick at this position in 2021. Barnes has been the biggest rookie surprise in the league, but most people still don't know about him so I forgive them.

So far Brian Gutekunst has spent all of his 1st round picks on guys who are athletic freaks or have massive ceilings. Alexander and Savage were both 4.39 guys, and Rashan Gary is a 275 DL who could run a 4.54. Love has as much or more natural athletic talent than any QB in this past draft but just needs time to sit before he is ready to play. This tells me that Gutekunst prefers using his most valuable picks on the most valuable positions on the team: secondary, pass rusher, and QB. 

Look I'm just trying to help you create a more realistic mock draft going forward. Of course no position can be ruled out, and I'll never do that. I just don't think ILB is a big deal for the Packers. They are going to continue their trend of targeting freak athletes at the most important positions on the field over positions that fans/media assume they should pursue such as ILB and WR. If I were making a mock, I would be looking for the next CB, DL, OT, or safety (basically the athletic freaks) when it comes to the Packers 1st round pick."
5744,2020-10-09 12:15:19,j7cp1i,"Just personally I wouldn't take that type of player top 10 or 15. I think he will probably go top 15, just think it's a mistake"
5745,2020-10-08 17:34:03,j7cp1i,"Parson might have higher value on a relative basis but the positional WAR impact of a WR1, combined with the value of clarity on Jones, makes him more valuable choice."
5746,2020-10-09 03:30:30,j7cp1i,"versatility, and speed."
5747,2020-10-09 17:24:44,j7cp1i,"Well seeming as we have no sample to go off on for him, I have no idea. But strictly basing your idea of him potentially not making a deep playoff run is completely and utterly stupid"
5748,2020-10-08 20:29:49,j7cp1i,"I don't know, regardless of how I feel about Jones, Trevor Lawrence would be too good to pass on, I would take him."
5749,2020-10-09 12:39:57,j7cp1i,"Have we learned nothing from the last few years? The Packers don't use rookies very much, so most picks will be riding the bench while they develop just like Rashan Gary and Jordan Love."
5750,2020-10-09 12:07:35,j7cp1i,If you are going to make these threads you have to have thicker skin. It's just my opinion and I'd bet a good bit of money theu don't move on from him
5751,2020-10-09 12:09:50,j7cp1i,I did read the first paragraph. You said you were using tankathons order and it was a mock draft. Just figured it was yours mister rogers
5752,2020-10-09 12:10:37,j7cp1i,It says nothing about whose  mock it is
5753,2020-10-08 19:18:59,j7cp1i,"You think I actually read a post on Reddit before commenting? The gall. 

But seriously, no i didn’t read the primer I just went to the list. I do see now how it’s ranked."
5754,2020-10-08 13:34:32,j7cp1i,I apologize...for not ripping on Khari Willis and Julian Blackmon for being absolute bums haha /s
5755,2020-10-08 13:46:12,j7cp1i,"I mean, that's definitely possible but I have faith in Jones right now. I might be wrong so let's just wait and see."
5756,2020-10-08 20:36:31,j7cp1i,"It might be a non-terrible idea, but that's based on the fact that Lawrence is such a highly rated prospect maybe some team offers a completely stupid package to move up to pick him. If that doesn't happen then whoever has No.1 should absolutely pick him."
5757,2020-10-08 17:15:40,j7cp1i,lol ok expert
5758,2020-10-08 14:16:50,j7cp1i,"Any rumors to this? Or is this your own ideological thing?

Not that that's bad. Just want to know if Stef/Berry have actually done anything to support this claim."
5759,2020-10-08 23:08:22,j7cp1i,"facts lol. and... ryan is still fine but you can see he's really getting to the twilight years lol

us being able to draft lawrence would be a dream ofc but we can't really cut ties with matt without and insane deadcap until after next season.. but even then man. if you have the chance to draft lawrence and you have a 36 year old QB... you do it lol

even though our defense needs like 10 new starters lol you just have to take lawrence there"
5760,2020-10-09 03:27:39,j7cp1i,You obviously don't watch the Falcons
5761,2020-10-09 03:31:11,j7cp1i,"Yes, we should trade back if we are in position to take Lawrence but I'm not doing trades in these mocks. And we are certainly contenders if we fix the defense."
5762,2020-10-09 12:21:29,j7cp1i,You have to remember people were saying similar things about Aaron Donald though
5763,2020-10-09 12:09:51,j7cp1i,"IMO speed is overrated in the sense that people liked Ruggs over Jeudy because of ""speed"". I find him overrated because of that but don't get me wrong, he's a 1st rounder."
5764,2020-10-09 18:21:03,j7cp1i,Teddy is not winning you guys a Super Bowl and everyone knows it.
5765,2020-10-09 12:11:20,j7cp1i,I'm just saying you can't put absolutes on anything in the draft
5766,2020-10-09 12:10:23,j7cp1i,Now we're on the same page!
5767,2020-10-09 12:12:09,j7cp1i,Wel I obviously wrote it. I didn't link a website and there's no reason for me to copy and paste a mock
5768,2020-10-08 20:21:13,j7cp1i,Haha good on you for owning up
5769,2020-10-08 13:37:55,j7cp1i,[deleted]
5770,2020-10-08 13:51:11,j7cp1i,"That's fair but I think it's safe to say if they pick 1 he's done there. If Gettleman somehow survives that then sure maybe they give him another chance. Did you have a very high grade on Jones? Because I don't think he's done anything to get that faith, he's towering over Winston's turnovers number at the start of his career."
5771,2020-10-08 18:00:22,j7cp1i,You just can't pass on Lawrence.  Guys like him come around every 10-15 years or so.
5772,2020-10-08 14:27:57,j7cp1i,"Berry and DePodesta are in charge and I would be shocked if we paid a RB a top 5 contract at the position which is what Chubb is going to get. Stef doesn't have roster control or anything although I'm sure he has input, and as we just saw this week he and Callahan can get a good running game out of a guy who's been on and off the team after starting in the AAF."
5773,2020-10-09 12:28:25,j7cp1i,"Haha. Because he was short. Aaron Donald and Marvin Wilson are 2 different types of players. You could do that for any player picked at any position. Well they said that about player x so player y might be him.
Marvin Wilson shouldn't be a top 15 pick. You can come at me in 4 years if I'm wrong"
5774,2020-10-09 18:47:58,j7cp1i,"I mean seeming as I’m a Bears fan, it’s pretty hard for him to win one for us"
5775,2020-10-09 12:14:26,j7cp1i,"No, you really can't. Think we all learned that with Kyler Murray. Case is going to get fired and a new coach will come in. This is different because arnold actually showed he can play some unlike Josh Rosen, who sucks"
5776,2020-10-08 13:40:24,j7cp1i,Well shit guess I'll admit Willis and Blackmon are the greatest safeties of all time :(
5777,2020-10-08 13:55:08,j7cp1i,"Well, this is assuming the draft takes place today. They're 0-4 and without their #1 player in Barkley so we do need to see more of them this year. I just think Jones doesn't have a good supporting cast."
5778,2020-10-08 18:34:44,j7cp1i,"So if the Chargers fall into the 1st overall pick, they should give up on Herbert because Lawrence only comes around every 10-15 years? Or the Bengals with Burrow? Or the Dolphins with Tua?"
5779,2020-10-08 20:37:29,j7cp1i,Yes I fully agree but I'm not doing trades so Giants just take Parsons
5780,2020-10-09 12:33:29,j7cp1i,!RemindMe 202 days Let's see if he's top 15
5781,2020-10-10 03:13:58,j7cp1i,Didn't even bother looking at your flair but you know what I meant
5782,2020-10-09 12:21:02,j7cp1i,It's pretty consensus that Darnold is also not that great himself.
5783,2020-10-08 13:50:12,j7cp1i,[deleted]
5784,2020-10-08 14:00:06,j7cp1i,"True but also their number 1 player being a RB, or all their run stuffing DTs, is all you really need to know"
5785,2020-10-08 18:59:12,j7cp1i,Daniel Jones isn’t burrow or Herbert lmao so this is absolutely not the same situation
5786,2020-10-08 18:37:54,j7cp1i,"Stupid hypothetical, look at the giants and Jets and you tell me whose going to outsuck us lol"
5787,2020-10-09 02:56:24,j7cp1i,It's a darn shame that the cards didn't pass on kyler even though they'd taken a qb 10th overall the year before
5788,2020-10-08 20:18:42,j7cp1i,"Yes. To all three (Burrow you could maybe aruge). QB is that important where if you get a chance at a legit epic prospect like that you take them, let them battle it out for a year or two with each other, figure out who is best, and trade the other. 

Lets say Burrow ends up being like the #7-12 best QB in the NFL during his prime years. Thats awesome. But if Lawerence ends up being a top 1-4 QB for his prime, I would definitely trade the opportunity cost of using picks on QBs in back-to-back years to have that small (but significant upgrade). Its not like Tua, Herbert, Burrow, or Lawerence wouldn't net you at least a first round pick in the trade market, and even if it was like the 10th-15th overall pick I'd easily trade down 9 spots in the draft if I could upgrade at QB -- even if it was like going from QB9 in the NFL to QB3.

Burrow is again the one who maybe you have an exception for. If you think Sewell is a generational LT prospect then I think I'd rather have a generational LT and QB9 than QB3 with a weak offensive line."
5789,2020-10-09 12:41:17,j7cp1i,Yeah and hot me up after his 1st and then 2nd year in the league. I just think you can use that pick on a more impactful player. Just don't think he will ever be great. We will see
5790,2020-10-09 12:26:30,j7cp1i,Has he had a fair shot? The coaching and the players around him have been bad. I think he would get another shot
5791,2020-10-08 13:53:29,j7cp1i,I'm going to go deal with the emotional trauma from that
5792,2020-10-08 14:02:08,j7cp1i,True...but lots of teams have been successful with below average QBs. I think they need to focus on fixing positional holes unless Danny just absolutely bombs the entire season
5793,2020-10-08 19:00:24,j7cp1i,But Herbert isn't Lawrence
5794,2020-10-09 12:29:55,j7cp1i,Same can be said for Rosen
5795,2020-10-08 14:06:39,j7cp1i,Teams have had success with below average QBs but those guys are usually game managers not turnover machines. You can have success with Bridgwater or Cousins but not with Winston.
5796,2020-10-08 19:13:30,j7cp1i,"He isn’t but so far what he’s shown indicated he could possibly be good enough to lead a playoff contending team, Jones hasn’t. It isn’t about Lawrence necessarily it’s whether you have a qb who can win"
5797,2020-10-09 12:38:56,j7cp1i,"Not really. Rosen has had 2 chances and looked really bad. Darnold has showed something. So, do you think Rosen is good and darnold bad?"
5798,2020-10-09 18:22:51,j7cp1i,I think both have not gotten chances to actually look good. Rosen had bad O-lines and Arizona and Miami. Darnold has had bad o-lines and receivers.
5799,2020-10-08 07:48:38,j78ugh,Ruggs was dropped in both my leagues. Definition of a lottery ticket WR

5802,2020-10-08 10:41:57,j78ugh,"I was gonna make a comment saying I can only speak for my favorite team, and then the first guy you listed was Jeff Smith WR NYJ. So Kudos. Jeff is an UDFA who was very raw as he played QB in college. But he has great athleticism and he looked really smooth and natural on Thursday. It’s very, very possible he just had his best stat line of the year (7/81) but he’s someone to keep an eye on. I want to also mention another Jets WR returning from IR, Vyncint Smith. With Perriman not showing much, and always hurt, a deep threat is much needed. Vyncint is a true speedster and will be getting targets now that he’s back. 

I guess I should also mention Denzel Mims if I’m talking about the rest of the Jets WRs lol. Nobody knows how good he’ll be yet. We’ve barely seen him play at all. But he’ll certainly be fine with targets once he comes back. He’s designated to return from ir this week but it’s reported that his hamstring is still bothering him a little so it might be another week or two."

5804,2020-10-08 12:42:27,j78ugh,"As a pats fan, I can’t support the Byrd call. Belichick can make any jag look good except at receiver. I wouldn’t trust Byrd for fantasy. The argument for him is someone besides Edelman has to catch passes and that Harry hasn’t looked good. But do they? Do they to the point that they would be fantasy relevant? I’m doubtful. I think they will keep running the ball, particularly in the red zone. Will there be a game where Byrd goes off? Probably. Will you be able to predict that one game? Doubtful.

Also if you doubt my point about belichick with receivers, just look at the receivers we’ve drafted the last 20 years. He’s the greatest coach of all time, but can’t identify or develop receivers to save his life."
5805,2020-10-08 14:59:47,j78ugh,We're high on Mooney in Chicago. Coaching staff sent a letter to his college coach praising how great he is. Add competition from Miller for the #2 spot and they both should be trying their hardest.
5806,2020-10-08 10:19:52,j78ugh,I started Hardman last week cuz Davante Adams was inactive last min and won because of him but he is just a stash/bench/droppable player for me. He is the 5th option on the Chiefs offense and until Tyreek or Watkins goes down I don’t expect much from him. He does well against tougher defenses because they game plan to take away Kelce and Tyreek. If the Chiefs are playing a weaker team where the chance of a blow out is high I wouldn’t start him. Once the Chiefs get a large lead they’ll stop passing the ball thus eliminating chances for Hardman. So keep this lottery ticket stashed and cash in against the right defense

5810,2020-10-08 08:05:28,j78ugh,"1. Flacco is horrid. Darnold is actually a really good quarterback. The Jets offensive coaching and o-line are holding him back. I disagree heavily and would fade Flacco + any receiver 

2. Tampa Defense is pretty stout, but for some fucking odd reason Bears offensive coaching is run Monty down the middle. It was mind boggling watching them play against the colts. They literally decided to throw the ball until the last minute of the 4th. Made no sense. For that reason I’m extremely hesitant on bears receivers. I hope Nagy learned his lesson .

3. I agree I like Damiere Byrd outside of Edelman. Harry sucks and they barely know how to use Harry’s size properly. Byrd is utilized Much better under belichek  so he has potential"

5820,2020-10-08 10:03:16,j78ugh,"I did this this Season with RB1son, now im doing it with hopefully Damien Harris and , i also picked CD Lamb in Week 1. 
Im still searching for the next Ticket 😏"
5821,2020-10-08 10:30:18,j78ugh,He was dropped in my league too. Guess I’m scooping him up. I just wasn’t sure if i wanted to see how tim Patrick pans out or if I should drop him for ruggs
5822,2020-10-08 13:11:33,j78ugh,"Like Ruggs, but I am concerned about his volume in that offense. We know that offense mainly runs though Jacobs and Waller. It looked promising for Ruggs in Week 1 when he had 5 targets before getting injured. 

In Week 2 though, he only had 3 targets with 1 catch in a relatively high scoring game."
5823,2020-10-08 15:35:19,j78ugh,Isnt his a hamstring injury? I dont trust speed guys with hammy injuries
5824,2020-10-08 12:24:37,j78ugh,Drop Hardeman for Ruggs?
5825,2020-10-08 10:43:22,j78ugh,"Mims isn't practicing this week so I'm not expecting him to come back this early

EDIT: Why would you downvote this lmfao, they said 18 hours ago he isn't ready to practice yet"
5826,2020-10-21 23:28:32,j78ugh,"As a Jets fan, who is the best Smith: Jeff Smith, Vyncint Smith, or Brad Smith?"
5827,2020-10-08 15:51:56,j78ugh,"I think this is weirdly 100% true, although I do think he knows a good one when he sees one (Randy Moss). I think probably also WRs that are good are also prone to egos or whatever that might not fit what he tries to do with a team, and he'd rather build a guy from nothing than force someone else in."
5828,2020-10-08 13:45:10,j78ugh,I’m not a believer in Tyreek Kelce and Watkins all staying healthy. One of those 3 go down he could pop off
5829,2020-10-08 14:08:08,j78ugh,"Yahoo standard. As my 5th and final wr on my roster and sitting as a lotto; would you take Brandon cooks, Tee Higgins, or Mecole Hardman?"
5830,2020-10-08 22:02:21,j78ugh,All of those were drafted in my league lmfao
5831,2020-10-08 08:10:31,j78ugh,"You'd be making solid points for the first two if I was saying to start them, but there's a possibility they show enough promise on your bench this week that people would want them next week even if they didn't necessarily blow up due to their QB/opposing defence situation

It's called lottery tickets for a reason lmfao, nobody needs ANOTHER post telling them to pick up Robert Tonyan"
5832,2020-10-08 10:27:47,j78ugh,Hey you should call up Bill and tell him how to use Harry properly then
5833,2020-10-08 10:38:32,j78ugh,"Well Mims didn't practice and Jeff Smith did well last week

Would be a pretty shit Week 5 Lottery Pick if they didn't play lmfao"
5834,2020-10-08 12:43:51,j78ugh,"As someone who drafted 8 RBs, I feel you brother"
5835,2020-10-08 14:09:20,j78ugh,"Gut instinct was ""Tee Higgins and it isn't close"", but I'm shifting to ""Tee Higgins but it's not SUPER far off""

Higgins doesn't have a great fixture list, but is still guaranteed more opportunities than Mecole"
5836,2020-10-08 10:55:13,j78ugh,"I mean I wouldn't advocate starting either, but I'd rather the guy playing the Broncos (Byrd) than the Cardinals (Smith)"
5837,2020-10-08 16:44:21,j78ugh,Fully convinced Tim Patrick gets knocked down for being named Tim Patrick.  And I am named Patrick.
5838,2020-10-08 13:37:37,j78ugh,"There's no RB lotto tickets lost on the waiver wire lmfao

At least my waiver wire anyway"
5839,2020-10-08 10:04:51,j78ugh,"I'm stunned CeeDee Lamb wasn't drafted in your league honestly

Dude went in the 9th in mine"
5840,2020-10-08 14:22:07,j78ugh,"Agreed Carr can’t get him the ball effectively, and he’s not part of the game plan."
5841,2020-10-08 14:07:33,j78ugh,"Yahoo standard. As my 5th and final wr on my roster and sitting as a lotto; would you take Brandon cooks, Tee Higgins, or Mecole Hardman?"
5842,2020-10-21 23:57:33,j78ugh,Jeff and Vyncint can’t even sniff Brads jockstrap yet haha
5843,2020-10-08 08:15:03,j78ugh,I’m not saying start them. Those two players are in the worst run offenses in the league. I wouldn’t touch them with a stick until things turn around.
5844,2020-10-08 13:43:08,j78ugh,That’s why they’re lotto. Here’s one I just made up: Wayne Gallman - Giants faithful for multiple years and showed way more efficiency than Devonta. Gallmans had all season and preseason to mesh with the giants line. Devontas on a 1 year contract and 100% will not be back next year since they have saquon - so the giants may want to see what they have in Wayne if he continues to out perform devonta
5845,2020-10-08 10:13:15,j78ugh,"A lot of guys dont know the rookies and we all were afraid that the rookie WR couldnt produce because of no training-camp (Covid-Related)

Even Zak Moss wented in the 14 Round of the Draft but the only rookie WR who got Drafted was Judy in the 15."
5846,2020-10-08 17:51:20,j78ugh,I'd stash Higgins of those.
5847,2020-10-22 00:00:58,j78ugh,"The way the Jags are using Shenault is giving me the vibes of B. Smith and his versatility.

But I might be completely wrong with that observation"
5848,2020-10-08 08:44:10,j78ugh,"By that point it could be too late

Jamison Crowder has pulled in 219 yards and a TD in the two games he's played this season for one of the worst run offences in the league. Allen Robinson brought home 224 yards and two TDs in his last two games

The fact these two have put up points despite their offence sucking means their teams can still generate offence even if it's in garbage time, and the fact they have been so successful means it's likely coverage will be focussed on their, leaving the likes of Smith and Mooney more open space to get shit done"
5849,2020-10-08 13:35:13,j78ugh,9th is a bit high being a 3rd receiver option
5850,2020-10-22 00:02:25,j78ugh,Yeah I could see that but with Shenault having more ability as a true WR
5851,2020-10-08 03:32:37,j75r5q,"I'm confused, what does this have to do with achievement hunter?"
5852,2020-10-08 03:37:15,j75r5q,"Given the current news about Ryans recent omission, I feel like this song kind of works to express my feeling of betrayal and sadness. Obviously its intended purpose if about a recent breakup in a relationship, but if feel like it still applies."

5854,2020-10-08 09:22:44,j75js2,Loved the letter.  I never cared for ces letter.  To this day I have never read the whole thing.
5855,2020-10-08 03:17:41,j75js2,"While I don't subscribe to the same beliefs or agree with the conclusions, I think your project is one of the better apologetics of this viewpoint and wish folks would turn to that among others rather than the CES letter and such.

By the way, saw the home page and its worth noting there were some updates with the whole Grant Palmer thing heavily suggesting he lied about/embellished that claim."
5856,2020-10-08 13:37:15,j75js2,"I like your tone and the arguments you raise are good ones. I am curious if you have applied these same critical thinking tools to a study of Christianity? Many have found that when they do so, they discover that the Old and New Testaments have many problems as well."
5857,2020-10-08 16:34:29,j75js2,"A few thoughts:

Apologists will never be good enough to explain adequately what is clearly problematic. If that were possible, the church would have taken that route instead of obfuscation and subterfuge. 

I’m as critical of stories against the church as those for it. The Greek psalter story makes no sense. It occurred in 1842. JS was exposed to the Greek alphabet in 1835. Within three months of frequent exposure to the Greek alphabet I could easily recognize it. I think this story is false. 

Invitations to challenge the church truth claims were false vibrato made in a time before the internet. The church would never invite such challenges without being sure and it bolstered confidence. Now anyone with a hand-held device (and that’s virtually everyone) can take up the challenge. And presto, the church is hemorrhaging members. Attempts to be more honest (gospel topics essays) have made thing worse. Now they tell horror stories about post Mormon life (something they know nothing about) and tell you to doubt your doubts. A global pandemic, which people wonder why they didn’t see it coming, shut down church meetings, temples and missionary work. The church is likely shrinking for the first time ever and no one really knows how to stop it. The pollyannish tone of GC coupled with a fresh insult hurled at the innocent children born out of wedlock did nothing to turn this around."
5858,2020-10-08 15:53:26,j75js2,"Short and to the point on 2 critical facets of the church. I noticed the word ""mote"" should be ""more"". Just a heads up."
5859,2020-10-08 09:20:14,j75js2,This has all been done before
5860,2020-10-08 17:26:47,j75js2,"CES letter is a duplicitous takedown. This, at a glance, appears to have a spirit of reconciliation."
5861,2020-10-08 12:12:56,j75js2,"> the whole Grant Palmer thing

Never been impressed with this guy.  We should stick to real scholars like Vogel, Quinn, and Thomas Alexander.  I haven't investigated it enough to know if Palmer is consciously misleading or just in possession of faulty information, but many of his claims seem suspect."
5862,2020-10-08 18:13:02,j75js2,"""I like your tone...""

Sounds like you're well on your way to finding the truth! There's nothing more important than tone."
5863,2020-10-08 20:01:43,j75js2,"Thank you and will fix.

Regards,

Paul"
5864,2020-10-08 12:10:53,j75js2,"...and it will be done again.  The LDS church has been inspiring strong negative reactions by apostates since at least 1835.  When the church claims inspiration from God and then turns around and changes what it claims are diving pronouncements/dictations, it upsets people and they react by writing about it."
5865,2020-10-08 15:29:14,j75js2,"There is some overlap, but there are also new insights. The CES letter and Letter For My Wife, as good as they are, barely scratch the surface on the topic of Mormonism. There is certainly room for additional similar works without risking excessive redundancy."
5866,2020-10-08 16:44:16,j75js2,"When I first came to this sub about a year ago, I knew virtually nothing about actual church history despite being in it nearly 60 years. As 
we learn the truth, we are going to object and insist on honest discussion even if this means repeating the same stuff for as many times as we were lied to in church. And believe me, this sub has not been around long enough to accomplish that."
5867,2020-10-08 18:34:39,j75js2,I respect Jeremy and I understand where he was coming from. But I preferred the tone of letter to my wife or apostle.
5868,2020-10-08 22:40:30,j75js2,"> many of his claims seem suspect

I second this.  My experience looking into some of his claims is that Grant Palmer is not a very careful scholar."
5869,2020-10-08 18:37:41,j75js2,Gotcha.
5870,2020-10-08 18:38:00,j75js2,I could be painting it the way I first saw it with TBM eyes

5945,2020-10-08 03:58:02,j74epa,Well guys we've continued our trend of scoring 3 goals a game. I'd call that a win =P
5946,2020-10-08 04:00:27,j74epa,Roldan pls
5947,2020-10-08 04:00:33,j74epa,This game is gonna haunt CR7
5948,2020-10-08 04:00:59,j74epa,"Roldan, have faith in chips again!"
5949,2020-10-08 02:22:36,j74epa,JP is so good on the defensive end
5950,2020-10-08 02:33:08,j74epa,I like how Sam Johnson has the most American sounding name of anyone in the game yet he’s not American.
5951,2020-10-08 02:37:52,j74epa,That was an unselfish bear!!! Great goal Jordan!
5952,2020-10-08 02:46:34,j74epa,Nico doing the unintentional splits
5953,2020-10-08 03:28:11,j74epa,defending? never heard of it
5954,2020-10-08 03:29:35,j74epa,yeimar stronk
5955,2020-10-08 03:29:55,j74epa,Great ball by Nico. He's fired a few beauties tonight
5956,2020-10-08 03:32:56,j74epa,lol bruin not looking happy at all

5958,2020-10-08 03:34:17,j74epa,"We now have 7 players on the field (Putna, Holt, Portillo, Chang, Besler, Martinez, Schmitt) who are honestly just USL level players.  Would any of these guys get significant minutes on any MLS contender?"
5959,2020-10-08 03:35:50,j74epa,Not the Nouhou goal we were looking for
5960,2020-10-08 03:36:04,j74epa,That's not what we meant by we want you to score Nouhou....
5961,2020-10-08 03:36:13,j74epa,We finally got a Nouhou goal?
5962,2020-10-08 03:37:25,j74epa,This is not the Nouhou goal we've been waiting for.
5963,2020-10-08 03:54:45,j74epa,oh good we've got a proper target striker on the field again
5964,2020-10-08 04:00:01,j74epa,Omg... Come on Roldan.
5965,2020-10-08 04:00:04,j74epa,Cristian!!! Shoot that bb
5966,2020-10-08 04:00:05,j74epa,BE SELFISH HOLY FUCK!!!
5967,2020-10-08 04:00:23,j74epa,Like.... I get being unselfish. But we've given up 2 chances to possibly score in this half.
5968,2020-10-08 04:01:31,j74epa,GG RSL. You're welcome for that goal
5969,2020-10-08 02:06:35,j74epa,Sounders broadcast team on ESPN+ today.
5970,2020-10-08 02:07:48,j74epa,"OK boys, don't screw this up."
5971,2020-10-08 02:12:21,j74epa,God please no
5972,2020-10-08 02:13:12,j74epa,"I thought VAR could’ve seen a touch from the RSL defender thus making Morris onside, but it would’ve been a stretch"
5973,2020-10-08 02:18:18,j74epa,Nice thing about Joao Paulo is he’ll likely never get called up to the Brazil team. We recently haven’t had our best players from big soccer Nations like Brazil
5974,2020-10-08 02:20:07,j74epa,"That goal was probably offside, but it is such a huge pet peeve of mine when broadcasters show a freeze frame from several steps before the pass to make the determination.  
  
On the Sounders broadcast, it looked like Morris got back on side and then off again between their freeze frame and the actual pass."
5975,2020-10-08 02:30:52,j74epa,"Little known fact, the ""Real"" was actually inspired by Real Valladolid, who are currently 20th in La Liga"
5976,2020-10-08 02:33:03,j74epa,"Come on Sounders, give me a big win on my cake day. 

*PS: on my birthday, September 18th, we have had some nice wins over the years :)*"
5977,2020-10-08 02:35:28,j74epa,Jordy clearly won the ball.
5978,2020-10-08 02:35:31,j74epa,LOL!!! That was the cleanest tackle ever and the call went our way?! ProReferees are going to get us some possession stats.
5979,2020-10-08 02:36:43,j74epa,The Roldanissance continues
5980,2020-10-08 02:37:26,j74epa,Heck of a dummy by Bruin
5981,2020-10-08 02:38:30,j74epa,Okay let's bag another one and sit Jordan at half

5986,2020-10-08 03:34:38,j74epa,"douglas coming on, he's going to teach them how to dougie, if dougie meant missing easy chances and having bad positional awareness"
5987,2020-10-08 03:35:34,j74epa,Oh no lol
5988,2020-10-08 03:35:52,j74epa,Not what we all had hoped for Nouhou's first goal.
5989,2020-10-08 03:36:14,j74epa,Nouhou wyd bro
5990,2020-10-08 03:37:21,j74epa,That was a great tackle
5991,2020-10-08 03:38:48,j74epa,Though Brad Smith was Jordan running down the lane for a second there
5992,2020-10-08 03:39:27,j74epa,"even the ""great"" reffing tonight isn't saving us"
5993,2020-10-08 03:41:55,j74epa,The officiating has been so so bad last few games I don’t even know how to explain it
5994,2020-10-08 03:47:38,j74epa,"just hoof the ball into the area, maybe we can get another own goal or a penalty called because they looked at chang funny"
5995,2020-10-08 03:48:45,j74epa,"Leerdam throws a look at Nouhou ""that's how you don't score on your team"" =P"

6001,2020-10-08 04:01:58,j74epa,what a ball though by nico that was a beauty
6002,2020-10-08 02:18:42,j74epa,I love how salty all the other RSL peeps are in this thread. Betting on a train wreck for us.
6003,2020-10-08 02:20:46,j74epa,Morris please don't hurt yourself
6004,2020-10-08 02:35:20,j74epa,But he won the ball?
6005,2020-10-08 02:36:58,j74epa,Holy hell that was legit as fuuuuck
6006,2020-10-08 02:37:18,j74epa,Worth the wait
6007,2020-10-08 02:37:40,j74epa,Nothing better than the Jorstian Mordan connection. You love to see it.
6008,2020-10-08 02:45:41,j74epa,Nico trying to style on Glad 😳
6009,2020-10-08 02:54:56,j74epa,"Seattle is daring Tate Schmitt to attack and beat them, and he's just not rising to the challenge at all."
6010,2020-10-08 03:15:58,j74epa,Jorstian Mordan!  Drink!
6011,2020-10-08 03:16:37,j74epa,Oh man I don't know how he missed that one
6012,2020-10-08 03:17:57,j74epa,"I wish we had men's soccer at the U of U. Then again, I didn't watch when I was at UVU and we had a good team, so maybe I don't deserve it."
6013,2020-10-08 03:21:13,j74epa,Jazz vs SuperSonics. That was the real shit.
6014,2020-10-08 03:24:20,j74epa,Lol Justen no ref is gonna buy what you're selling there
6015,2020-10-08 03:27:39,j74epa,Not a foul on Roldan?

6020,2020-10-08 03:30:26,j74epa,Sounders are the team to beat this year. Fucking 2020.
6021,2020-10-08 03:36:09,j74epa,Our offence is so bad seattle is having to score for us
6022,2020-10-08 03:36:37,j74epa,"oh nooooo, not like this!"
6023,2020-10-08 03:43:52,j74epa,"In an overall shitty season, Ruiz has been a bright spot for RSL. Almost Everyone else can fuck off."
6024,2020-10-08 03:45:40,j74epa,"If we ever want to create any chances ever, Chang needs to be on the same side as Herrera."
6025,2020-10-08 03:50:09,j74epa,"Nico should have shot that.

Beautiful pass by João."

6035,2020-10-08 02:19:51,j74epa,That back 5 is going to just keep locking us out.
6036,2020-10-08 02:20:36,j74epa,"I hate how often it looks like Jordan gets hurt. I swear it happens like once a game Adds so much stress into my life. 

Edit: I say “looks like he gets hurt” I don’t mean he fakes injuries I mean like it looks like an injury where he might have to come off or have something serious"

6057,2020-10-08 03:34:42,j74epa,How bad is Ramirez showing in training?! I can’t believe we spent so much for him if we are reaching for our recently promoted USL players over him.

6063,2020-10-08 03:45:21,j74epa,Any update on leyva? This would be great for rotation for him if he’s healthy
6064,2020-10-08 03:49:07,j74epa,Camera angle did not help my anxiety there.
6065,2020-10-08 03:49:55,j74epa,"I'm not really enjoying this.  If we could score another, that'd be great."

6122,2020-10-08 03:38:39,j74epa,@Kasey Keller because VAR doesn’t review for yellow cards. VAR is only initiated for “game changing scenarios” aka red cards and goals. If VAR reviewed everything yellow card then games would be way slower
6123,2020-10-08 03:39:11,j74epa,Is this ref planning on only carding us tonight?
6124,2020-10-08 03:44:32,j74epa,"Love Joao Paulo, but can we try to find him a new barber?"
6125,2020-10-08 02:09:44,j74epa,"Give it!!!! Give it to Jordan!

Edit.... Ok he is off"
6126,2020-10-08 02:09:57,j74epa,GAHHHH
6127,2020-10-08 02:19:43,j74epa,Is he hurt?
6128,2020-10-08 02:21:23,j74epa,if we win this i'll be suprised but very happy
6129,2020-10-08 02:25:02,j74epa,I'm honestly not sure if Keith Costigan just described RSL as looking a little bit more *confident* on the ball or *competent* on the ball.
6130,2020-10-08 02:30:11,j74epa,"we are intercepting the ball well, but we are not doing anything with it."
6131,2020-10-08 02:36:47,j74epa,MVP
6132,2020-10-08 02:36:49,j74epa,Let’s goooo boys
6133,2020-10-08 02:36:50,j74epa,Aaaand that's game.
6134,2020-10-08 02:52:43,j74epa,"Random question, but does anybody know how MLS defines the ""missed chances"" stat?"
6135,2020-10-08 03:07:20,j74epa,I would love to see Ramirez subbed in early this half
6136,2020-10-08 03:17:26,j74epa,Yeimar can really win an aerial header!
6137,2020-10-08 03:28:49,j74epa,Totally fooled the keeper with the header
6138,2020-10-08 03:29:18,j74epa,Yeimar can really head the ball lol
6139,2020-10-08 03:35:55,j74epa,Nuhu ChooChoo!
6140,2020-10-08 03:35:56,j74epa,Ooof
6141,2020-10-08 03:36:00,j74epa,LOLOLOL!!! We scored.
6142,2020-10-08 03:36:02,j74epa,NOUHOU NOOOOOOOO
6143,2020-10-08 03:50:08,j74epa,Goal for goal! Fuck
6144,2020-10-08 03:56:22,j74epa,if only we could play like this the whole game
6145,2020-10-08 03:57:26,j74epa,brad a lil sloppy there
6146,2020-10-08 03:59:14,j74epa,I'm not having fun
6147,2020-10-08 04:00:11,j74epa,Shoot the fucking ball man
6148,2020-10-08 02:07:16,j74epa,I remember not liking Corey Baird
6149,2020-10-08 02:55:45,j74epa,That’s some bullshit at the end
6150,2020-10-08 03:35:47,j74epa,Hahahahahahahaha
6151,2020-10-08 03:37:26,j74epa,"Refs are really against us this season, what the fuck"
6152,2020-10-08 03:38:48,j74epa,Why are these refs the past several games absolute shit
6153,2020-10-08 03:43:33,j74epa,"Didn't even play the ball, just put his body in front of Lodeiro."
6154,2020-10-08 04:00:11,j74epa,"Oh Cristian, you gotta shoot that."
6155,2020-10-08 02:07:34,j74epa,I just remembered how much I dislike Corey Baird
6156,2020-10-08 02:26:59,j74epa,"Can someone please tell Will Bruin that he’s big? Never seen a dude his size get bodied out of a challenge so consistently. Use your size, Will!"
6157,2020-10-08 02:38:29,j74epa,Love how Glad and Holt watched that ball stroll through the 6 yard box.
6158,2020-10-08 03:43:47,j74epa,Nasty challenge on Nico there 😡
6159,2020-10-08 02:06:39,j74epa,[removed]
6160,2020-10-08 02:38:15,j74epa,Bruin with the whiff that ends up a goal.
6161,2020-10-08 02:09:30,j74epa,????
6162,2020-10-08 02:10:13,j74epa,what a shame
6163,2020-10-08 02:10:22,j74epa,Spicy.
6164,2020-10-08 02:10:57,j74epa,OMG
6165,2020-10-08 02:12:01,j74epa,Still a promising start
6166,2020-10-08 02:23:33,j74epa,"This is crazy, but I'm gonna say it. Is JP better than Lodeiro? I mean... Probably not, but maybe...."
6167,2020-10-08 02:33:32,j74epa,A draw is the best we can hope for.  I simply don't see this lineup scoring.
6168,2020-10-08 02:36:28,j74epa,"great goal, bad defending"
6169,2020-10-08 02:36:37,j74epa,#JORDY MAKES UP FOR JORDY GETTING A BS YELLOW
6170,2020-10-08 02:36:49,j74epa,Jordys got Jordys back 👍
6171,2020-10-08 03:36:03,j74epa,Nouhou booboo :(
6172,2020-10-08 03:36:06,j74epa,J.C. Nouhou. That was so ridiculous
6173,2020-10-08 03:40:20,j74epa,He's finally done it!
6174,2020-10-08 02:12:10,j74epa,Kinda thought that var would end up with an RSL PK
6175,2020-10-08 02:25:29,j74epa,good idea from sam there. unlucky
6176,2020-10-08 02:55:15,j74epa,God and now the WA State Gov Debate is coming on JFC.
6177,2020-10-08 03:49:25,j74epa,I think that salt lake figured out they will have better success if they don't put crosses in the area of Yeimar
6178,2020-10-08 02:35:22,j74epa,"Did these announcers just say that was a fair hard tackle? Yikes.

Edit: did I imagine the scissor tackle or is that fair now?"
6179,2020-10-08 03:36:45,j74epa,"easy yellow, good tactical foul"
6180,2020-10-08 02:57:59,j74epa,"Lol, they just showed the pedophile fountain on the waterfront on the JoeTV broadcast."
6181,2020-10-08 03:11:32,j74epa,Is it possible to not love Brian Schmetzer?
6182,2020-10-08 03:42:37,j74epa,Yep - very solid depth
6183,2020-10-08 03:43:12,j74epa,"Yeah, it's nice to not be scared anymore when we need to start our backup centerback(s)."
6184,2020-10-08 03:46:02,j74epa,Agreed. He’s definitely improved with time. Still has the Torres tendency to kinda wander around a bit but he can usually get back in time. Much better than I expected him to be after the start of the year (although I’d still start Xavi over him if they’re both available)
6185,2020-10-08 03:44:14,j74epa,Some Monkey's paw shit right there.
6186,2020-10-08 03:44:14,j74epa,Monkey Paw curls
6187,2020-10-08 02:12:01,j74epa,one of us one of us
6188,2020-10-08 03:39:31,j74epa,That was my first thought
6189,2020-10-08 03:36:50,j74epa,MUAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
6190,2020-10-08 03:38:50,j74epa,Unbelievably garbage lol
6191,2020-10-08 03:15:54,j74epa,Midweek match against RSL... I'm just checking in from watching the debate too
6192,2020-10-08 03:15:20,j74epa,Happy cake day!
6193,2020-10-08 03:14:39,j74epa,RSL threads seem to be pretty low in attendance here.
6194,2020-10-08 04:09:07,j74epa,He’s the only player that will not be criticized for scoring an own goal just cause he’s such a meme.
6195,2020-10-08 03:54:36,j74epa,"The BBB, Big Boi Backline."
6196,2020-10-08 03:53:55,j74epa,Imagine how scary it would be to look up and see Roman *and* Yeimar running at you..
6197,2020-10-08 02:13:22,j74epa,could not agree more
6198,2020-10-08 02:40:00,j74epa,Jorstian Mordan!
6199,2020-10-08 02:39:33,j74epa,Let's calm down just a bit. I love cr7 but he's not a world class midfielder
6200,2020-10-08 02:50:58,j74epa,"I think it’s a loan through this year, and then an option to buy for two more years."
6201,2020-10-08 04:13:34,j74epa,"Thanks for not helping our GD. 
I mean if you were going to lose anyway, just could have kept it 2-0 and also given Morris some 15 minutes off at the end???!?"
6202,2020-10-08 04:08:23,j74epa,You’re ... welcome?
6203,2020-10-08 03:29:48,j74epa,using the word defending is giving us too much credit
6204,2020-10-08 03:31:03,j74epa,Literally just thought this. A couple of big bois nailing headers.
6205,2020-10-08 03:31:14,j74epa,*Steven Lenhart and Alan Gordon in shambles*
6206,2020-10-08 03:35:43,j74epa,Two absolute units take the field
6207,2020-10-08 03:25:20,j74epa,Dude just hasn’t seemed the same since the injury. I feel for him. Still a bit frustrating to watch though. All he had to do was head that anywhere except straight into the keeper and it’s a goal.
6208,2020-10-08 03:52:29,j74epa,I’ve noticed them a lot more at weekday Mariner’s games w/ small crowds
6209,2020-10-08 03:32:47,j74epa,Just wait until Smith and Torres are on the field at the same time.
6210,2020-10-08 02:40:53,j74epa,"Morris: yeah bro. 

Nohou: tru story."
6211,2020-10-08 04:11:08,j74epa,"I hope his check engine light comes on randomly, but the machine at O'reilly does not read the code"
6212,2020-10-08 02:22:42,j74epa,Absolutely need him for a playoff run
6213,2020-10-08 02:26:12,j74epa,He’d probably a decent goal keeper tbh
6214,2020-10-08 02:44:10,j74epa,"He has the best smile on the team, we have to keep him. Nouhou is a close second."
6215,2020-10-08 02:27:17,j74epa,A goalkeeper?
6216,2020-10-08 03:31:29,j74epa,"Yeah, they stopped playing for Freddy a while ago. They got up for the first LAFC and then went right back to boring old shit show."
6217,2020-10-08 03:32:43,j74epa,"I don’t know, we have a dedicated set piece coach. Maybe this all part of his brilliant plan."
6218,2020-10-08 03:32:01,j74epa,i hate zonal marking so much
6219,2020-10-08 03:39:44,j74epa,I like this new version of Kasey that craps on the refs.
6220,2020-10-08 03:38:55,j74epa,This weekend is what they did to Kasey.
6221,2020-10-08 03:42:23,j74epa,It’s fucked over our team multiple times.
6222,2020-10-08 03:44:13,j74epa,You got to admit the reffing is just plain bad
6223,2020-10-08 16:44:26,j74epa,Congratulations. You played yourself.
6224,2020-10-08 02:18:52,j74epa,Has there been any news about new owners since the flurry of people right when all the DLH/Carroll stuff came out?
6225,2020-10-08 02:35:22,j74epa,Hopefully that is the bad call of the night
6226,2020-10-08 02:36:18,j74epa,"I think the ref saw the (unintentional) scissoring of Delem’s legs. I don’t think it’s a yellow either, but guessing that’s why"
6227,2020-10-08 02:44:26,j74epa,But I wish they’d notch it up a bit from 144P.
6228,2020-10-08 03:24:31,j74epa,I thought so until the replay. Looked like they were grappling equally there.
6229,2020-10-08 03:34:49,j74epa,"TFC, you up?"
6230,2020-10-08 03:34:06,j74epa,"Round 4, FIGHT!!!"
6231,2020-10-08 03:41:19,j74epa,We’re resigned to our fate.
6232,2020-10-08 03:54:20,j74epa,Obviously Torres is gonna be playing forward
6233,2020-10-08 03:59:59,j74epa,Technically correct. The best kind of correct.
6234,2020-10-08 02:36:05,j74epa,🇱🇷 Listen 🇱🇷 liberal 🇱🇷 if 🇱🇷 this 🇱🇷 flag 🇱🇷 offends 🇱🇷 you 🇱🇷 you 🇱🇷 can 🇱🇷 LEAVE! 🇱🇷
6235,2020-10-08 03:33:47,j74epa,Bruin will get the start in our next match. Just needs to knock some rust off.
6236,2020-10-08 03:34:39,j74epa,"I'm sure he's not happy he didn't score, but we need him to start at least 6 games with one happening every 4 days..."
6237,2020-10-08 03:34:30,j74epa,"Mad he didn't score, should have really. But not a bad performance"
6238,2020-10-08 03:34:23,j74epa,My body is ready
6239,2020-10-08 03:35:52,j74epa,I'm just looking forward to winger Torres putting beautiful crosses into the box.
6240,2020-10-08 02:09:21,j74epa,Seems like the first time this year. I swear the almost never use the Sounders broadcast.
6241,2020-10-08 02:19:34,j74epa,That would require VAR to be properly used.
6242,2020-10-08 02:31:50,j74epa,Why Valladolid?
6243,2020-10-08 02:32:37,j74epa,i don't think that's true
6244,2020-10-08 02:36:19,j74epa,"No, it was inspired by Real Skateboards. Dell Loy Hansen used to shred back in the 90s."
6245,2020-10-08 02:34:06,j74epa,Happy cake day!
6246,2020-10-08 03:05:17,j74epa,"Doesn't matter. The scissor leg makes it a yellow, end of story."
6247,2020-10-08 02:38:36,j74epa,He’s spreading his *wings*?
6248,2020-10-08 02:37:17,j74epa,The real CR7
6249,2020-10-08 02:37:58,j74epa,Was it intentional thogh? :)
6250,2020-10-08 02:39:13,j74epa,"Yes, a dummy. We will go with that lol."
6251,2020-10-08 03:35:49,j74epa,"I think it was the right call tonight, but once you're down yeah you'd like it to change"
6252,2020-10-08 03:39:14,j74epa,He just reallllllly wanted a goal.
6253,2020-10-08 04:11:30,j74epa,"I'm not gonna hold that one against him, shit happens, bad luck."
6254,2020-10-08 03:41:21,j74epa,It legit takes me a second or two to tell them apart sometimes
6255,2020-10-08 03:42:36,j74epa,Nouhou is trying tho
6256,2020-10-08 03:42:47,j74epa,Don Garber trying to break up the dynasty
6257,2020-10-08 03:54:13,j74epa,"If Tate Schmitt isn't playing above Jeizon on merit, that's a coaching problem

If he is, it's a front office problem"
6258,2020-10-08 03:54:31,j74epa,"I mean, he hasn’t looked *great* in his appearances."
6259,2020-10-08 02:19:52,j74epa,we have beckerman playing as a center back
6260,2020-10-08 02:56:32,j74epa,"Well, he can’t play the ball forward, so it looks like Seattle is being smart about who they leave open."
6261,2020-10-08 03:18:42,j74epa,"We don't have it at Wazzu either, luckily we have an incredible women's team to watch 👍"
6262,2020-10-08 03:29:36,j74epa,Let Nico cook
6263,2020-10-08 03:31:18,j74epa,"I dunno, the Timbers are the holders of the MLS is back trophy. Tough to beat that kind of prestige. 🤪"
6264,2020-10-08 03:32:29,j74epa,Well you guys beat us twice lol
6265,2020-10-08 03:32:33,j74epa,Maybe? Hard to say until east and west are playing each other again.
6266,2020-10-08 04:00:34,j74epa,GGs my dude
6267,2020-10-08 04:01:18,j74epa,GG!
6268,2020-10-08 04:01:34,j74epa,gg
6269,2020-10-08 04:03:58,j74epa,You saw attackers?
6270,2020-10-08 02:32:08,j74epa,That’s what happens when you field 7 defenders.
6271,2020-10-08 03:23:17,j74epa,Yeah - that was a very juicy rebound
6272,2020-10-08 03:30:09,j74epa,Already his second - he had one the last time we played RSL
6273,2020-10-08 03:39:06,j74epa,Frei's face.
6274,2020-10-08 03:46:34,j74epa,Still listed out with the broken foot
6275,2020-10-08 03:46:26,j74epa,Fotmob says he’ll be back late October but I’m not sure what they’re basing that on - the MLS injury report just says that he’s out with no timeline
6276,2020-10-08 04:03:37,j74epa,It had much more to do with their subs
6277,2020-10-08 04:02:40,j74epa,I mean he scored one of those just a couple games ago. He just wanted to set the BFF up too badly there lol
6278,2020-10-08 03:45:38,j74epa,"We have this theory that refs like to kind of crap on us at home because they want to put a stamp on the game that they weren't swayed by the centurylink stadium atmosphere, so this is pretty typical."
6279,2020-10-08 03:03:35,j74epa,He's been like that since returning from his ACL tear
6280,2020-10-08 02:10:34,j74epa,Last time we played a team we were supposed to destroy we lost 1-0 at Portland 😞
6281,2020-10-08 03:42:31,j74epa,"Even with the weight of today vs. the past...


**Not even close. **"
6282,2020-10-08 03:41:59,j74epa,"Nah, this guy’s not great, but the call on Yeimar was an all-timer"

6286,2020-10-08 03:55:24,j74epa,You first
6287,2020-10-08 03:55:09,j74epa,No thnx!
6288,2020-10-08 02:43:50,j74epa,Bruin was smooth
6289,2020-10-08 02:58:41,j74epa,"I mean, they took like 20 seconds to take the throw in, it was well past the 1 minute minimum."
6290,2020-10-08 02:58:12,j74epa,ProReferee’s don’t wait on nobody.
6291,2020-10-08 02:59:16,j74epa,"Nah, they set up for a long throw and then threw it in short, that's a wasted chance. If you get a corner after the time is up you don't take it short lmao, why would you do that with a throw"
6292,2020-10-08 03:38:59,j74epa,3 hours ez
6293,2020-10-08 03:46:11,j74epa,pandemic chic
6294,2020-10-08 03:48:09,j74epa,"His hair definitely isn’t great but at least it isn’t as bad as Smith’s lol. Just shave your head, man."
6295,2020-10-08 03:45:35,j74epa,How dare you speak ill of that man =P
6296,2020-10-08 03:46:03,j74epa,Probably against the Covid protocols.
6297,2020-10-08 03:50:15,j74epa,Yedlins old one perhaps
6298,2020-10-08 02:22:32,j74epa,Hot Take if I've seen one.
6299,2020-10-08 02:22:26,j74epa,"After looking at both team’s lineups, I would be convinced I was dreaming if I saw we won."
6300,2020-10-08 02:27:23,j74epa,Yes.
6301,2020-10-08 02:32:08,j74epa,Covfefe.
6302,2020-10-08 02:30:57,j74epa,It’s because Glad keeps passing to the green kits
6303,2020-10-08 02:37:58,j74epa,Lot of game left bud
6304,2020-10-08 02:08:11,j74epa,Cause he sucks more than his haircut.
6305,2020-10-08 02:08:21,j74epa,Jinx
6306,2020-10-08 02:57:14,j74epa,"I agree. Our commentators made fun of salt lake, but I would expect at least one touch to be allowed after the throw. If they made a back pass *after* the throw, then it's right to blow the whistle."
6307,2020-10-08 02:56:37,j74epa,...don't take 30 seconds to throw the ball in when you're already over the extra time?
6308,2020-10-08 02:07:36,j74epa,Dude at least this debate doesn’t feel like a playground argument
6309,2020-10-08 02:41:54,j74epa,It was a great dummy.
6310,2020-10-08 02:24:16,j74epa,Only time will tell... Hopefully we have more years with both of them
6311,2020-10-08 02:25:41,j74epa,"Hard to say because they’re similar types of players, but play different positions. I’d say Joao Paulo is probably a better 6 and Lodeiro is a better 10, which makes sense based on their numbers"
6312,2020-10-08 02:26:25,j74epa,"They play a very different game, so it's hard to compare. I think that Joao's service is better for sure. I hope that Lodeiro stops taking our corners, he's always underperformed at them."
6313,2020-10-08 02:55:54,j74epa,Is Brian Schmetzer gonna be our governor?
6314,2020-10-08 02:36:36,j74epa,"That back leg trailing looked rough initially, but clean as can be on the replay."
6315,2020-10-08 02:38:35,j74epa,Well it was. So there’s that.
6316,2020-10-08 03:38:39,j74epa,scratch that clean tackle
6317,2020-10-08 03:37:28,j74epa,How was that a yellow?
6318,2020-10-08 03:00:02,j74epa,Username checks out
6319,2020-10-08 03:14:41,j74epa,"If that's where your head goes when you see that fountain, you might have some issues, dude."
6320,2020-10-08 03:01:50,j74epa,... the what? Wtf is that
6321,2020-10-08 03:51:41,j74epa,">although I’d still start Xavi over him if they’re both available

Oh, completely agree. Shane has just been a very solid backup to have as depth that has given us some relief in the backline that was pretty shaky at the start of the season."
6322,2020-10-08 03:22:04,j74epa,"I used this as an excuse to stop watching. How was the last 45 min, same as the first? (I heard about the fly)"
6323,2020-10-08 03:15:30,j74epa,They’re also hasn’t been a ton to talk about in this game
6324,2020-10-08 02:40:19,j74epa,i mean that roldan literally looks like gundogan.
6325,2020-10-08 02:57:32,j74epa,"I heard the buy clause was mandatory, and that’s it’s for accounting reasons?"
6326,2020-10-08 04:16:23,j74epa,"Dude, you guys were talking non-stop about an Nouhou goal. He simply made it happen. Hell of a player. Not sure what he was doing there, but still, he is a hell of a player."
6327,2020-10-08 03:26:42,j74epa,"I don't think he's really all that different, he's always been a bigger aerial threat and hold up guy.  He's a good rotational player."
6328,2020-10-08 03:33:34,j74epa,"OH GOD

edit: happy cake day!"
6329,2020-10-08 02:42:32,j74epa,Choo choo: True true
6330,2020-10-08 02:28:50,j74epa,"You guys could probably play without one tonight, tbh"
6331,2020-10-08 05:00:46,j74epa,Meanwhile JP can only look angry AF.
6332,2020-10-08 03:35:28,j74epa,Is that what they’re supposed to be doing?
6333,2020-10-08 03:45:43,j74epa,It’s been great for us. LOL!
6334,2020-10-08 03:45:08,j74epa,true dat
6335,2020-10-08 02:20:19,j74epa,Not seen anything recently. I'm getting a little antsy haha
6336,2020-10-08 03:25:45,j74epa,Paulo threw him over the knee once the grappling started.
6337,2020-10-08 03:34:55,j74epa,"MLS is sounders world, rest of the league is just living in it"
6338,2020-10-08 02:44:48,j74epa,🇱🇷 I love Liberia 🇱🇷
6339,2020-10-08 02:32:44,j74epa,I picked the La Liga team that was lowest in the standings and named Real for this joke
6340,2020-10-08 02:32:54,j74epa,Because OP’s joking
6341,2020-10-08 02:33:10,j74epa,Well we're no Galacticos
6342,2020-10-08 02:38:58,j74epa,There’s another one?
6343,2020-10-08 02:39:25,j74epa,"I think so? 80% sure. It wasn’t a great angle for him, so I don’t think he’d try?"
6344,2020-10-08 02:42:57,j74epa,"From the makers of the Shot Cross, it’s the Whiff Dummy"
6345,2020-10-08 03:45:04,j74epa,Wish they'd send some of that up Toronto's way though
6346,2020-10-08 02:20:55,j74epa,Kyle “Center” Beckerman
6347,2020-10-08 02:21:32,j74epa,4 defensive midfielders on pitch. What could go wrong? Good hell.
6348,2020-10-08 02:28:31,j74epa,Let's play Beckerman as a fullback instead of Toia next game; can hardly be worse
6349,2020-10-08 03:01:27,j74epa,"Yeah 100%, it's a good strategy that's working for them.  He's gotten the ball in a few dangerous positions but just not created chances from them.  I'm having a hard time imagining that Ramirez would be worse in this position."
6350,2020-10-08 03:22:13,j74epa,what why doesnt wsu have mens soccer
6351,2020-10-08 03:20:12,j74epa,"Ew, cougars"
6352,2020-10-08 03:32:46,j74epa,Are you telling me we haven't? We'd be unstoppable
6353,2020-10-08 03:33:54,j74epa,I think he has been for a few years now.
6354,2020-10-08 03:35:15,j74epa,"Yes, a bunch of us bought those promo wheelbarrows that said MLS is Back Champions 2020 to carry our balls around and it is the best $249 I've ever spent."
6355,2020-10-08 03:42:04,j74epa,The only solace I can take. And I'll take it.
6356,2020-10-08 03:33:41,j74epa,So ... MLS cup final then lol
6357,2020-10-08 03:25:22,j74epa,That’s what she said.
6358,2020-10-08 03:30:48,j74epa,Hahaha yeah I saw the graphic after making this comment
6359,2020-10-08 03:46:09,j74epa,How many clean sheets has he lost on bullshit this year... I count at least 3
6360,2020-10-08 04:04:09,j74epa,"True. It also seemed he was uncomfortable with the pressure coming from behind, which is something attacking players are used to."
6361,2020-10-08 03:47:10,j74epa,that makes total sense
6362,2020-10-08 02:12:56,j74epa,"we are on a 2 game losing streak on artificial pitch fielding a usl quality squad, I fancy your chances"
6363,2020-10-08 03:48:55,j74epa,"Yeah, is it legal for SKC to cheer for us?"
6364,2020-10-08 03:50:17,j74epa,"True. If it threatens to quit, fire it"
6365,2020-10-08 03:47:13,j74epa,Have Dad Schmetzer do it.
6366,2020-10-08 02:27:22,j74epa,We are missing some players to international duty.
6367,2020-10-08 02:39:47,j74epa,"If RSL gets a shot on frame, I’ll wear a Mariners shirt tomorrow."
6368,2020-10-08 02:59:10,j74epa,"Eh, throwing it back like that probably did it.  If it was a long throw into the box I doubt he would've blown it right then."
6369,2020-10-08 02:08:31,j74epa,It at least has some semblance of civility. Not a ton but some.
6370,2020-10-08 02:43:42,j74epa,I mean that's how I'd tell it if I was him.
6371,2020-10-08 02:43:20,j74epa,"It ended up as one, but he was def trying to shoot that lol"
6372,2020-10-08 02:56:41,j74epa,I mean he's better than a certain sheriff...
6373,2020-10-08 02:38:16,j74epa,Delem - earlier on - went way too aggressive on those tackles. I'm impressed how well he did keeping his trailing leg out of that one. I'm still nervous each time he goes in with those tackles that it'll be straight-red-worthy.
6374,2020-10-08 03:48:02,j74epa,There's that fartsniffing gatekeeping  that I love!
6375,2020-10-08 03:35:12,j74epa,"Its a joke guy. The city went with this particular design because they were uncomfortable with a sculpture of two naked men so they decided the better alternative would be a naked man and a naked boy reaching out towards each other and they made sure they were obscured most of the time by water. This was the solution to being uncomfortable with homosexuality and it is hilarious that they thought this was ""better""."

6377,2020-10-08 03:32:32,j74epa,You missed the best part... it was on his head for ages.
6378,2020-10-08 03:16:18,j74epa,That's fair.
6379,2020-10-08 03:16:25,j74epa,Also true
6380,2020-10-08 02:41:02,j74epa,"That was not clear, but fair, carry on"
6381,2020-10-08 03:06:05,j74epa,"I don't know if it is mandatory or not, but it is a bit of Garth Accounting Trickery(tm).

Overpay on the loan, underpay on the transfer which is spread out over a few years and poof...only a DP this year."
6382,2020-10-08 02:59:38,j74epa,"Yeah, I think you’re right"
6383,2020-10-08 04:18:00,j74epa,"Ha ha. We have been pining for a Nohou goal since...

Like...

2019 😂"
6384,2020-10-08 16:35:35,j74epa,">Not sure what he was doing there

Really? It's quite obvious what he was trying to do there"
6385,2020-10-08 03:31:05,j74epa,He has 1 goal and 0 assists in over 300 minutes this season. It hasn’t been great.
6386,2020-10-08 03:26:45,j74epa,*Brazilian* Jiu Jitsu eh? Ehh?
6387,2020-10-08 02:33:45,j74epa,Oh I thought it was an actual fact I was intrigued
6388,2020-10-08 02:41:51,j74epa,Lol watch the slow-mo replay from behind. He was definitely trying to shoot and completely whiffed. It fooled the hell out of the RSL defense though so it worked out great.
6389,2020-10-08 02:44:55,j74epa,"Well hey, as long as it legally puts the ball in the back of the opponents’ net, then we’ll take it!"
6390,2020-10-08 03:22:46,j74epa,"We're a small school, and title IX reasons mean we can't afford more men's sports"
6391,2020-10-08 03:22:14,j74epa,"We are good at only a few things. Cheese, ice cream, wine, women's soccer."
6392,2020-10-08 03:33:26,j74epa,We need to let him keep cooking
6393,2020-10-08 16:36:37,j74epa,Have had this exact experience myself lol.
6394,2020-10-08 03:48:25,j74epa,except...
6395,2020-10-08 02:29:29,j74epa,"I know, but I think Delem, Bruin, and maybe O’Neil would all start for us these days. Never mind all the other great players you have out here."
6396,2020-10-08 03:12:40,j74epa,No. No. No one deserves that.
6397,2020-10-08 02:58:03,j74epa,"I think starfire seats more people than live in the town where the sheriff ""enforces the law"""
6398,2020-10-08 03:06:30,j74epa,So ... just regular art then lmao. Okay
6399,2020-10-08 17:05:43,j74epa,He’s actually played for us since 2017...this was 3 years in the making lol
6400,2020-10-08 17:12:49,j74epa,Come get your hot takes!
6401,2020-10-08 03:27:48,j74epa,JP Gracie
6402,2020-10-08 03:29:20,j74epa,"Sure, but wouldn’t mind some Capoeira."
6403,2020-10-08 03:23:56,j74epa,Drinking. Don’t forget drinking
6404,2020-10-08 03:23:00,j74epa,Losing to the Huskies in the Apple Cup. You left that one out 😜
6405,2020-10-08 03:01:03,j74epa,I love the fact that in the voter's pamphlet his contact phone number is an Oregon area code...
6406,2020-10-08 02:59:13,j74epa,"lmao that actually would be hilarious if true. It probably is considering it's a ""two cop town""

Edit:

Holy Shit it's true. The City of Republic has a population 1070 and the Stadium at Starfire has a capacity of 4500."
6407,2020-10-08 19:56:50,j74epa,Yeah but we didn’t expect him to score a goal until like last year :)
6408,2020-10-08 17:16:36,j74epa,"Trying to clear that ball is 100% standard procedure, sometimes shit just happens. His intentions were inarguably obvious. The only hot take is ""I'm not sure what he was doing there."" Yes, you are sure, he just messed it up."
6409,2020-10-08 03:24:32,j74epa,Trying to paper over that one haha
6410,2020-10-08 03:27:24,j74epa,Does it really count as drinking if it’s Busch Light though? Lol
6411,2020-10-08 03:23:31,j74epa,That's true. Jimmy Lake just owns us
6412,2020-10-08 03:04:55,j74epa,No way... LMAO
6413,2020-10-08 03:06:42,j74epa,The capos at the Brougham end are in charge of more people 😂
6414,2020-10-08 22:02:16,j74epa,Would you say that you are not sure what I was trying to do there? Is that a fair statement?
6415,2020-10-08 03:29:17,j74epa,And fireball. Combined it counts
6416,2020-10-08 03:07:55,j74epa,"Yep, a 541 area code."
6417,2020-10-08 03:08:42,j74epa,Absolutely incredible.
6418,2020-10-09 00:27:54,j74epa,"When you combine

> Not sure what he was doing there

With

> Come get your hot takes!

It seems more like you doubling down than being sarcastic"
6419,2020-10-09 04:18:35,j74epa,I like my McDoubles with a Hot and Spicy Chicken in between.
6420,2020-10-09 04:31:24,j74epa,I like your buns
6421,2020-10-08 03:36:29,j74a7k,Nouhou got his first goal!
6422,2020-10-08 02:00:21,j74a7k,[deleted]
6423,2020-10-08 04:19:07,j74a7k,Props to Yeimar. He’s everything we wanted from him and more.
6424,2020-10-08 03:37:03,j74a7k,Well Nouhou finally scored his first goal
6425,2020-10-08 03:39:25,j74a7k,The officiating has been so so bad these last two games I don’t even know how to explain it
6426,2020-10-08 04:03:21,j74a7k,"Roldan should have been less unselfish there. He baited them to Morris with the head look, shoulda shot it woulda been iiiice cold."
6427,2020-10-08 03:58:12,j74a7k,It's way too quiet in here
6428,2020-10-08 02:03:09,j74a7k,Game start time?
6429,2020-10-08 03:38:34,j74a7k,"Wow, that was ugly."

6431,2020-10-07 22:54:33,j71bpr,I have no connection with the singer except that YouTube recommended this to me earlier today and I was amazed at her voice and felt sad that the video had so few views.

It does but usually that only lasts for a few weeks or so. Shoot for the stars genuinely has bangers on it.

The Scotts debut'd at #1 and then fell to #12 the following week which was the third biggest drop off in chart history. If [this](https://twitter.com/talkofthecharts/status/1313347105373601792) chart account is to be trusted (which it could be total bs but what it says wouldn't shock me), then Franchise is gonna free fall next week too.

Meanwhile Drake's newest single came out in the middle of august and is still #4, and even toosie slide, the song that everyone apparently hated, stayed in the top ~20 for months

6516,2020-10-07 00:23:25,j6boxf,"Not really close? He’s getting sponsorships from Fortnite and McDonald’s for a reason. He’s one of the most powerful brands in music right now.

Drake doesn’t sell merch like Travis either. Drake has more fans overall, but one can make the argument that Travis has a more dedicated fanbase. 

The fact that Travis can debut a song at #1 means that they’re not far off. He might be the 2nd most popular hip-hop artist in the world, so it’s a little disingenuous to say it’s not really close.

Just out of curiosity, how would you measure the gap between Drake and Post?"
6517,2020-10-09 00:04:49,j6boxf,"Travis has great streaming numbers and tons of songa with 300m+ streams on spotify. He has the staying power, his older music gets a lot of streams, he already has a lot of big songs a lot of people recognize him by: Antidote, Butterfly Effect, Stargazing, goosebumps (this is over a billion kn spotify) , Sicko Mode, The Scotts, Highest in the Room. But the same people who only recognize Travis are the same people who only recognize Drake by God's Plan, Kendrick by Humble, Eminem by Rap God, Juice by Lucid Dreams etc. 

I guess it all depends on his next album. If it's on the level of Astroworld, he is here to stay on the top 100%

Drake though is just on a different level in the past 10 years. I don't know if I mind it, I personnaly loved his last album, not scorpion though. Drake can really snap given the chance and effort, he found the sweet spot between rap and pop and capitalized on it. I don't know who else I could see on top of the game outside Drake and Travis (I don't classify Posty as hiphop)."

Yes the fortnite and mcdonalds deals indicate travis is huge, he is, but I don't think those are two things Drake couldn't have done if he wanted to

Travis very well could have a more dedicated fanbase but you need more than that to be at or near Drakes level of popularity, who can and has consistently make hits that appeal to pretty much every demographic, and stick around. Travis hasn't been shown to do that consistently yet. Album sales wise I don't think they're truly close either. How much do you think Travis would have done with Astroworld if he did 0 merch bundles? My bet is nowhere near half a mill. It's definitely impressive that he can debut at #1 but what does it indicate if it really does freefall next week, while Drake's single is in the top 5, like 6 weeks after its release? Especially when Drake is just putting the song out there vs if what /u/IIM_Clutch said in his above comment is true, Travis still has to do these merch gimmicks to get to where he is

I think the gap between drake and post is probably similarish to the gap between drake and travis, maybe a bit smaller depending on which metric of popularity you want to favor. Post doesn't have the album sales but he can dominate the charts like Drake can."

6543,2020-10-07 06:54:33,j6boxf,"your comments here have highlighted just how much of a push it is for travis to get commercial success. thank you for that. he makes dope music but let’s face it, he is far more blatant about using commercial tricks and heavy, *heavy* marketing to get a song anywhere in the top 10. drake just does what he does, and then it’s there. travis dropping anything and hoping it survives and becomes a hit without blatant marketing tricks is just a fools errand, clearly shown by the lack of staying power.

i’d also like to point that out that drake has, on multiple occasions, gotten chart toppers and hugely helped careers just by making songs with artists. remember 2018? drake got huge hits for travis, lil baby, blocboy JB, migos, meek mill...travis has never done that afaik. maybe don toliver? but that’s more because don had one of the most impressive features on one of the best selling rap albums of 2018, not because travis’ star power brought him huge support.

i say all this but i really fw travis’ music and even without the gimmicks hes a very commercially successful artist"

6547,2020-10-07 23:41:40,j6boxf,"The people you “know” in the punk pop scene probably have terrible taste in music just like you lmao.

6548,2020-10-06 23:34:09,j6boxf,.. But the album after the beef was Hotel Diablo which was a rap album
6549,2020-10-07 04:57:34,j6boxf,I’m sure it doesn’t but it’s still dumb to use merch as an argument for why Trav has a more dedicated fan base lol
6550,2020-10-07 11:54:47,j6boxf,"I actually agreed with you at first until I thought back on the release weeks of those two songs and they both were super hyped. The Scotts was released right after the fornite concert, people were hyped on a cudi travis collab, and the song had huge first week streams and HITR was super hyped too."
6551,2020-10-07 05:04:27,j6boxf,"Well it’s different, trav specifically games the system to boost his numbers. Maybe I’m not understanding your argument though"
6552,2020-10-07 12:14:43,j6boxf,"They were super hyped for sure, it's just the quality wasn't there so people stopped caring about them as much after the 1st week.. which is why The Scotts went from #1 1st week to #12 2nd week. HITR had a similar drop too 

&#x200B;

if the hype was real and the quality existed they woulda stayed at least top 3 for a while. Like songs like Toosie Slide/WAP/Blinding Lights/The Box etc did this yr. These last 3 Trav singles feel like very weak #1s"
6553,2020-10-07 05:20:37,j6boxf,"Yeah I was responding to this:

>	Drake doesn’t sell merch like Travis either. Drake has more fans overall, but one can make the argument that Travis has a more dedicated fanbase.

I was asking him for a source that shows Travis sells more merch than Drake cause I’ve read that OVO fashion sold $50 million two years ago."
6554,2020-10-07 05:33:04,j6boxf,Oh ok my bad. Tbf the ovo brand has kind of taken on a life of its one and the clothing isn’t necessarily related to drake or his recent releases
6555,2020-10-07 06:23:37,j6boxf,"Still his, imagine if he started doing ovo bundles with his music. It would be ridiculous."

The way these press conferences work are the managers just answer the journalists questions and all the questions were about Man U players fouls during the game, trying to draw a reaction from Jose. Unfortunately, no journalist asked the question about Son which would've been interesting to hear his response. However I did hear that South Korea aren't allowing non domestic players in the national team so Son should be staying during the break, if that information is any use to you."

6570,2020-10-06 17:24:20,j6892s,"The problem I have with Annihilationism is that it assumes that eternity will exist in time. There is a time when the soul of the sinner exists and then a later time where the soul doesn't exist, while on the other hand the souls of the righteous exist forever. If eternity is not just a really, really long time but rather a dimension beyond time then it's possible to conceive of the destruction as being an eternal state. It is the destruction itself that serves as the torment. This seems to be described in 2 Thessalonians 1:9 ""These shall be punished with **everlasting destruction** from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power"".  


You could draw a parallel to the way we say that the Word of God is begotten of the Father. He was begotten ""before all ages"" as we say in the Nicene Creed, that is, before time. Since the action is outside of time, it's not as if there was a time before He was begotten and then a time after when the begetting was over. He is eternally begotten. This eternal begotteness reflects the Word's eternal relationship with the Father. Likewise, I think eternal destruction represents the eternal relationship between the unrighteous and God. The language of destruction, death, being forgotten, etc. are still compatible with the idea of eternal torment because these actions are taking place beyond time."
6571,2020-10-06 17:14:03,j6892s,I oppose annihilation I personally prefer to suffer than cease to be in my opinion its better to be alive and in pain than dead.
6572,2020-10-06 17:21:35,j6892s,"One bit stands out in the OP that could be strengthened significantly and it’s the exegesis of Matthew 25:46...

>	When Jude 7 says (""Likewise, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities [...] serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire""), it does not mean that the cities are burning forever, but that the effect of that burning is ever lasting. Those cities were destroyed (as per the OT) and not on fire during the writer's day, suggesting a metaphorical meaning to the text. 

This argument presents a category error. The city structures are not what sinned, but rather it was the souls living in them. Likewise, that the structures are no longer burning is not what the passage refers to: it rather refers to the punishment of the souls that lived in them (see Matthew 11 where Jesus laments unrepentant cities). This is why Jesus used the same Greek term αἰώνιον to describe both eternal punishment and eternal life, *in the same sentence* (Matthew 25:46). He was not referring to physical buildings but to living souls.

I see no exegesis of Matthew 25 in your OP (did I miss it?), yet your argument dismisses a key text with hardly so much as a glance. Without any exegetical demonstration that Jesus did not (or even might not have) meant “eternal punishment” when he used the words κόλασιν αἰώνιον, it is rather difficult to consider your argument overwhelmingly convincing.

Edit: I haven’t yet read your support for Annihilationism but will do so. Thank you for sharing this as I’ve often wondered about the arguments to support that position. Overall I think this is a good post. :)"

6576,2020-10-06 16:23:47,j67gh3,It sucks we went from “hopefully Beasley can start taking snaps so Landry can get some rest and not be on every play” to “we’re so depleted that Landry absolutely is gonna play every snap”
6577,2020-10-06 16:38:02,j67gh3,This has to be a ball control game or the pass rush is going to be in slow-mo in the second half. Like you said we need all non covid players in action
6578,2020-10-06 17:54:40,j67gh3,Ben Jones is our long snapper for the time being I believe
6579,2020-10-06 17:19:18,j67gh3,"I understand the weather is supposed to be shitty this weekend in Nashville, so that could work to our advantage. I see the defense still giving up at least 24ish points if not 30 again, so it'll be on how many Tannehill & co can put up. I'm not overly optimistic unfortunately."
6580,2020-10-06 17:40:34,j67gh3,"Have a feeling we’re gonna need at least a 30-spot to stay in this game. Wouldn’t be surprised to see an over/under of like 62.5. At least that’s what it should be. As the defense stands now, I don’t think you stop JA and their pass attack. You just need to score enough points to hang with them.

If Henry can get to that 4th and 5th step most of the game I think that’ll be the difference. May take this game away from being a shootout."
6581,2020-10-06 19:51:15,j67gh3,We need to win this game similar to our playoff wins last year. Henry needs to feast and take the game away from JA

6583,2020-10-06 16:44:02,j67gh3,"Offense can put up a lot of points. Bills run D is shaky, I’m hoping Henry can go off and we can hold the ball for a long time to help out the defense"
6584,2020-10-06 16:34:15,j67gh3,"Indeed. If it makes you feel any better, Landry has played 95% of snaps the last two weeks. But that also makes me feel worse long-term.

Really, we just need Beasley to pick up those snaps that we'll be missing from Jones and Simmons. Which is, of course, very difficult. But with Dick, Mack, and Murch, not impossible."
6585,2020-10-06 16:57:19,j67gh3,"Absolutely. The biggest key to the game for us will be getting out in front early. They want to pass anyway, that will only be more true if they're playing from behind for the first time all year. If we knows it's coming, it will be easier to defend. And weird as it sounds, we're going to need to lean on our pass defense to get us through this one."
6586,2020-10-06 19:30:17,j67gh3,"Yep, [right here on the unofficial depth chart](https://twitter.com/PaulKuharskyNFL/status/1313266784393363469/photo/1) for anyone wondering. 

One small area to be positive about is that Brinkley was placed on the list last Tuesday. In theory, he could potentially be back as early as Friday. That's just the minimum, though, and there's always the chance he could be on there longer. I think even if he misses one week, you have to feel moderately optimistic that he'll be good for the Texans."
6587,2020-10-06 17:49:24,j67gh3,"I hope it rains 6 inches. But yes, I think it will be a game where we have to get to the 30s. Good news is we were able to hit that the last two games. Bad news is this isn't the Jags/Vikes defense."
6588,2020-10-06 17:50:48,j67gh3,"Totally agree. Like I've said to others, we need to get out in front early and control the pace. If we're trying to chase them, it'll be a long day. Even if we do dictate tempo, I think you're right, it's going to take 27-30 to get it done."
6589,2020-10-06 20:09:22,j67gh3,Lol I saw that on r/nfl a couple years ago and I can't see his name now without thinking of it.
6590,2020-10-06 16:55:01,j67gh3,"They actually have a top 10 run defense, but it's partially because teams have been chasing them offensively the last 4 weeks. The Rams and Dolphins had success on the ground against them, but the Jets and Raiders looked really poor. They really frustrated Josh Jacobs last week. It's actually their pass D, appropriately, that towards the bottom of the league (for the same reasons).

But you're still correct. We need to control the tempo. Honestly, our offense is built to run in this game. Weird as it is to say, we need to keep them passing against us. Our pass defense has actually been halfway decent statistically, but our run defense has been horrible, especially the last two games. It will help dictate things if we make them play from behind."
6591,2020-10-06 18:49:45,j67gh3,"Bill's Fan here, yall will be fine even if we take the lead in the first half. Our defense loves to fall asleep 2/3rd QTR. Our defense is not as dominant as the last 2 years. Your Run game will be critical though. I'm excited for a tough matchup, it should be a close game for both of us 😁"
6592,2020-10-06 20:24:55,j67gh3,"I’m not too worried about the o-line but the d-line looks rancid without Simmons and Jones, Crawford has made some plays but we’re out two starters up front, depth at edge, minimal depth at corner, minimal depth a receiver pending AJs injury."
6593,2020-10-06 17:56:55,j67gh3,"Ya we definitely don’t want to be chasing them. They’re really good this year and I fully expect them to demolish the Titans if they don’t have a good game plan. I’d love to see a couple 7-9 minute TD drives and make Allen feel pressured to score when he finally has the ball. 

Gotta be honest though between the injuries and the COVID outbreak the last week and a half, I think the Bills win by a touchdown. Probably gonna get downvoted for thinking that but it’s just how I see it as everything stands right now."
6594,2020-10-06 21:31:41,j67gh3,"Yea we're honestly in as good or better shape than we have been all year at every position but DL. 

CB a little with Fulton out, but he's only played 50% of snaps anyway. Same with Correa, and he hasn't even looked that great. 

But the non-Covid injuries will be most telling. AJB, Jackson, Roberson, Lewan. We can live without the Covid guys, but without any one of those guys, save maybe Jackson, we're in a lot rougher shape."
6595,2020-10-06 19:31:35,j67gh3,"Yea I think it's fair to say we're underdogs on Sunday. It's not ""no big deal"", but it's not as dire as some make it seem either. There is certainly a path where we can win."
6596,2020-10-06 22:51:12,j67gh3,"With Lewan out we’ll have to see how Ty Sambriallo can do outside of taking a few reps, I saw him play in Atlanta he’s a good player, I would equate him to Dennis Kelly in terms of talent meaning he’s good, and can fill in at either tackle spot, but doesn’t have Kelly’s versatility to play guard"
6597,2020-10-07 04:03:36,j67gh3,Has there been confirmation that Lewan is out? I really thought he was looking good for Sunday

IMHO, following a stupid religion doesn't automatically disqualify one from criticizing other people who follow another stupid religion. And such criticism is not hypocrisy. It would be hypocrisy if we started criticizing their religion and they reacted like butthurt Muslims. But in my book, one who tolerates criticism has the right to criticize others.

However, I did watch CP for a little while, that guy undoubtable has a lot of knowledge about Islam and like Masked Arab, he understands the original sources. But when it comes to Christianity, he acts like a typical Muslim. From what I can guess, he was oppressed in Saudi as kid, he saw how Christians were treated as second class citizen, developed a grudge against them and wants to show that his God has bigger dick than Allah.

For me, I want to learn about Islam from someone who understands Arabic and presents facts and one by one deconstructs Islamic narrative from within itself, like an intellectual critique. And for that reason, I consider The Masked Arab as the true godfather of the ex-Muslims on YouTube. I just wish he started making videos again, because honestly there is no one on YouTube who can do it better than him.

Christians don't have a choice because MuhaMAD and muslims plagiarised and bastardized ideas from the Bible.

Famously, Marvin Williams went # 2. Corey Maggette and Dion Waiters were also top 10 picks despite not starting for their college teams. This Williams has a pretty solid excuse as well, as we've already mentioned that Florida State had a good and deep program where players tend to wait their turn.

Still, it'd be hard for me to justify a lottery pick for Williams given what we've seen so far. He's a live body with good athleticism and strength. As far as his skill set goes, there's plenty of room to grow. He only hit 32% of his threes, and his assist/TO ratio of 1.0/1.7 suggests he can hone his basketball IQ as well. While he has theoretical upside given his physical profile, NBA benches are littered with good athletes who never quite figured out their niche.

In the right system, Williams may development into a starter, but it's unknown how long that'll take. Denver's Jerami Grant had a breakout playoffs this year, but he's 26. The team that drafts Williams should hope he can get to that level a little sooner.

***best fits***

Minnesota has the # 1 pick, but they also have # 17. Patrick Williams could fit them there as an active PF and defensive complement to center Karl-Anthony Towns. He'd also make some sense with Brooklyn (#19). Williams doesn't project as a sharpshooter, but the Nets have a pair of pretty good shooters in house.

***worst fits***

We mentioned a possible Jerami Grant comp already, which would make Denver (#22) an odd fit if they re-sign the actual Grant. I'd say the same about Philadelphia (#21), who is already stacked with frontcourt talent."
6753,2020-11-09 14:27:12,jqxyb4,I've been very much wanting to draft Poku as a Spurs fan. if it was possible to trade back with the Celtics or Mavs for a pick or two and a player then I'd be super happy to take him since he's the highest ceiling player in this draft to me. he isn't quite Jokic but he's an insane passer. his top end comp for me is like a hybrid of Porzingis and Jokic with better better mobility than either. only real weakness is strength. he's a guy who has rebounding and shot blocking instincts and a lot of length. I'm really not worried about him unless it's Embiid and Jokic he's guarding but they cook on everyone anyway.
6754,2020-11-09 15:32:15,jqxyb4,"> I'd project that [Edwards] can become an average (35-36%) three-point shooter in time.

I'm thinking the same; he'll be in that range or maybe *slightly* lower, and able to do it on high volume and degree of difficulty. Some reasons why I believe this:

**1**- Remember that this was college basketball's first season with a further back 3 point line and 3P% was down across the entire nation. This is the first time we're evaluating draft prospects with this deeper line.

**2**- Edwards is a 29% 3P shooter the same way Luka is a 31% 3P shooter...these guys' percentages are determined a lot by the high volume of step back and pull up 3's they take. Part of this is that Edwards' shot selection needing a lot of work but you probably won't be a star in the NBA as a guard if you won't take and can't make unassisted 3's off the dribble.

**3**- Lastly, his FT% is good and there's a reasonable correlation between that and NBA 3P %.

Torn on seeing **Vassell** at 6. I could see him being a very pedestrian offensive player; he doesn't dribble very much, doesn't have a quick first step, and rarely does finesse finishes. You're right that he looks like a future 3-and-D guy, which means that his offensive value hinges deeply on that catch-and-shoot 3P%. I don't have a feeling if he's headed towards a ""meh"" 35% or a great 38+. But I suppose he'll have some value in either of those cases as long as his defense is as good as advertised (I believe it is), thus the belief that he has a high floor. 

I'd put Hayes over Vassell, but he's probably top 10.  I have to learn more about these other prospects and watch some video to round out the rest of my list. This write up is well done and is a good starting point for some of these guys that I'm not familiar with."
6755,2020-11-09 18:23:44,jqxyb4,"Some more prospects that didn't fit into the post limit --

**(16) SF Saddiq Bey, Villanova**

Villanova veteran Saddiq Bey also meets the desire for 3+D wings who can blend in and surround a team's stars. Hell, he hit 45% of his threes this year! Better still, his 6'8"" size should allow him to play SG, SF, and even some smallball PF. Villanova players tend to have strong discipline and professionalism, which only makes him feel like a safer bet.

The reason that Bey ranks below some less polished 3+D players (like Isaac Okoro or Josh Green) is the lack of perceived upside. He's already 22.5 years old, and there's some concern that his 3 and D may not be upper level on either end. His shooting form doesn't look great, and is reflected in mediocre FT%. His defensive stats (0.8 steals, 0.4 blocks) don't suggest a star defender either. He should be OK in both facets, with an emphasis on ""OK."" If you draft Bey, you should be looking for a solid single and not a home run. 

***best fits***

Sacramento (#12) is the highest I can justify Saddiq Bey going. He can develop behind Harrison Barnes, and eventually take his place in the lineup. He'd also make sense for the teams looking for bigger bodies at SF, which include New Orleans (#13) and Portland (#16).

***worst fits***

With Saddiq Bey, you're not going to worry too much about the ""bust"" factor. However, some teams like San Antonio (#11) probably need a bigger swing for the fences. Their ""win now"" team isn't winning much right now, and it'll be time for a broader rebuild soon."
6756,2020-11-09 18:24:05,jqxyb4,"Some more prospects that didn't fit into the post limit --

**(17) PF/C Jalen Smith, Maryland**

Although Jalen Smith was a bluechip recruit in high school, he went under the radar over the course of his two year college career. His lack of buzz should be an NBA team's gain. The bespectacled one has the qualities that you'd want in a modern stretch big. He shot 37% from three this season, and blocked 2.4 shots per game.

Smith doesn't move around as fluidly as someone like Onyeka Okongwu, which makes me think he'll spend most of his time as a center at the next level. Still, you figure he's a good bet for a starting role on the right team.

***best fits***

Boston (#26, #30) would be a dream fit for Jalen Smith if he fall that far. He can help protect the rim defensively without clogging the paint offensively. He'd have more of a limited role in Utah (#23), but he'd be a nice change of pace behind Rudy Gobert there.

***worst fits***

Given Philadelphia (#21)'s overcrowded frontcourt, it's hard to see a fit there (barring an Al Horford trade.)"
6757,2020-11-09 18:24:24,jqxyb4,"Some more prospects that didn't fit into the post limit --


**(18) PF/C Precious Achiuwa, Memphis**

Jalen Smith's ability to play either the PF or C position is typically seen as a positive. Other times, players get blasted if they're perceived as ""tweeners."" Some of that set in to the narrative to Precious Achiuwa when he came to Memphis. He had the skill set of an energy big, but he appeared to be a pure PF in terms of size.

In some ways, Achiuwa may have James Wiseman to blame for that. He looked smaller next to that big-ass dude, in the same way a teen girl may look slimmer when sidled next to her [DUFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DUFF). 

When Wiseman left school, Achiuwa stepped up and looked the part of an effective smallball center. He racked up 15.8 points and 10.8 rebounds per game, showcasing very good athleticism and energy. At 6'9"" with a 7'2"" wingspan, he should have enough size to man the paint in the modern NBA. If his skill set and shooting continues to improve, he can be a good PF as well, but at the moment he projects best as a high-end rotational player and potential starter on the right team.

***best fits***

Teams should be eyeing Precious Achiuwa as a backup at first, and utilize him as a complement to their current starter. He'd make sense in that backup role behind Jusuf Nurkic in Portland (#16) as well as Nurkic's former teammate Nikola Jokic in Denver (#22). Both of those team's current backups (Hassan Whiteside and Mason Plumlee) are free agents.

***worst fits***

Philadelphia (#21) has already invested a ton in big men Joel Embiid and Al Horford; Precious Achiuwa wouldn't make much sense there. His lack of shooting (at this stage) would also make him a potentially clunky fit in Milwaukee (#24), as they've made a point to surround Giannis Antetokounmpo with spacing."
6758,2020-11-09 18:25:13,jqxyb4,"Some more prospects that didn't fit into the post limit --

**(20) SF Robert Woodard II, Mississippi State** (HIGHER than most expert rankings)

We mentioned Devin Vassell as a template for 3+D wings who can fit on virtually any team in the league. Mississippi State's Robert Woodard may be a bargain brand version of the same type of player.

Like Vassell, Woodard is a sophomore whose stats don't jump off the page -- he only averaged 11.4 points in 33.1 minutes of action. Like Vassell, his three-point shooting probably won't match his last year in college (43%) given the red flags with his poor FT%. But like Vassell, there's enough clay here to work with regardless. His shooting should be good *enough*, and he has a great frame for a wing at 6'7"" and a 7'1"" wingspan. 

Woodard's strength may be his best virtue. He's 230 pounds, and utilized that well on defense and on the glass (where he averaged 6.5 boards per game.) All in all, he's a 3+D player who could theoretically slide out and be a stretch PF as well. That versatility should make him a nice addition to a team, with his real value being dependent on how consistent he can be from deep.

I'd also mark Louisville's **Jordan Nwora** as a 3+D player who's being underrated by draft rankings. Nwora isn't as strong on defense as Woodard, but his shooting is much more reliable. I'd be surprised if both are not long-time pros.

***best fits***

Robert Woodard and Jordan Nwora aren't locks for R1 right now, meaning they could be potential steals later on. They'd both make sense for the Lakers (#28), particularly if the team decides to move on from Kyle Kuzma. They'd also fit with the Knicks (#27) as low-usage players to complement R.J Barrett on the wing.

***worst fits***

I don't see a solid 3+D prospect as a bad fit anywhere, but a team like Oklahoma City (#25) may be looking for higher-upside players at this stage. Boston (#26, #30) is also loaded on the wing, unless they end up losing Gordon Hayward in free agency."

Another thing worth pointing out about Avdija is the amount of NBA experience he played with. His teammates last year at Maccabi played a total of almost 2300 NBA games between them. That's gotta help getting yourself prepared and mentally ready for the NBA (especially with the shortened off-season and training camp)

For anyone curious, his teammates with NBA experience last season: Amar'e Stoudemire, Quincy Acy, Omri Casspi, Tarik Black, Tyler Dorsey, Nate Wolters and Othello Hunter. Also played with Johnny O'Bryant and Jeremy Pargo the year before

Prior to a small shoulder injury he was seen as a better prospect than Hayes and the people I've talked to who follow French basketball have said they prefer Maledon. At this point I'm honestly confused why he hasn't gotten more draft hype. At the very least he should be rated similarly to Deni because he was clearly a better player in EuroLeague.

Even though his handles are boring, I think he might end up being a guy that can score in mid range and make some smart passes.  But that does depend on him earning a role to do more than just spot-up.

Not saying he will be a star scorer, but I think, while he may not be some super stud three point shooter or slasher, he could be a good enough decision maker and smart enough player that he just brings enough value with his overall game to be better than they specialists."

6827,2020-11-09 16:10:53,jqxyb4,That’s funny I didn’t even notice that. I think their best scenario would be to get a guy like Haliburton who can eventually start alongside Booker.
6828,2020-11-09 15:29:43,jqxyb4,Especially if you’re eyeing a veteran PG. not sure I love the CP3 rumors but he’d be helpful to those young players.
6829,2020-11-09 17:52:33,jqxyb4,All risky to various degrees. Part of my assessment there is based on personality which I admit I’d be unqualified to do given my limited access.
6830,2020-11-09 14:26:58,jqxyb4,It’s possible. He really shot the lights out as a sophomore (and not as much as a freshman) so that’s a concern.
6831,2020-11-09 15:12:27,jqxyb4,"He didn't even touch on what I think is Nesmith's most valuable skill and that's the way he moves off ball around screens and positioning himself for passes from driving guards. I think in a draft like this with so many question marks, he has a clear path to being a valuable player."
6832,2020-11-09 20:15:20,jqxyb4,I'm sure they have upside -- I just have a bias against that type of player who are scoring guards. They seem easier to find than other positions.
6833,2020-11-09 18:12:59,jqxyb4,I can see that or a trade as most likely.
6834,2020-11-09 23:37:09,jqxyb4,"I think so to. Our only centers our Chriss and Looney. While both have been good young players, they are both small ball centers, and with Looney's injury concern they need another center who isn't undersized. That being said, a big traditional center to play 15 minutes a game to get beat up by Embiid and Jokic shouldn't be too expensive.


If not that, they really need a wing player that can shoot."

6838,2020-11-10 12:41:30,jqxyb4,"Well.

Is there chance that Deni ends up a bust? Yes. As with any other draft prospect which is not someone like Luka (MVP of 2nd best league in the world) or maybe Zion.

Specifically for same reasons as Hezonija? No. They aren't similar at all as players or personalities, and were in different situations before draft. Basically nothing in common except being white Europeans of similar size."

6847,2020-11-10 16:54:28,jqxyb4,True. If that was to work you’d have to play Toppin at the 5 and then your defense is even worse.

6849,2020-11-10 16:53:28,jqxyb4,Hmm I like Bolmaro from Argentina... maybe Vernon Carey the center from Duke as a bench scorer... will try to think of more.

6852,2020-11-10 16:52:52,jqxyb4,Agree about Josh Green. He was a top recruit too so it’s not like he’s been under the radar.
6853,2020-11-10 15:01:08,jqxyb4,That’s true but those guys averaged 20-12 (Ayton) and 21-11 (Bagley) as college freshmen. That’s pretty rare.

6860,2020-11-09 16:41:02,jqxyb4,That would be my ideal pick as well but I have my doubts he slides to 10. All this uncertainty will lead to a very interesting draft that's for sure.

But his release might be too slow for him to be like Korver or Redick coming off screens.  I think he can move off the ball, the concern is just that his release is too slow for him to be a deadly shooter off screens against NBA defenders."

- Taylor and Coles are interchangeable depending on how much you want to set a mongrel tone early.

- S. Barrett and Tuipulotu are probably interchangeable but I've gone for Barrett who has more test caps and more big game experience. 

- Ioane can go to the bench for Sotutu who goes to 8 if you'd prefer, but I prefer this way because Sotutu can come on and be a big bastard carrying off the back of scrums against tired flankers.

- Personally I think Whitelock is a better captain, but if the All Blacks use a leadership group like they have in the past then captain is basically just down to who you think is the best communicator with the ref."

Dude is unproven at this level and there's plenty of banging super players who failed to make the top level. Fwiw, I think he will but nothing's been proven...yet."
6885,2020-11-10 21:58:29,jqsotn,Only reason i put Asafo in the starting pack was because I feel like he could add a lot to the pack and by the time of the next world cup could possibly be new zealands version of tupou . Plus Codie Taylor is kinda average now and coles will simply be too old .

I'm as big a Will Jordan fan as anyone (I mean, look at the flair, I clearly have an eyepatch) but I agree that it's crazy how fast he's being pushed as a candidate at 14. He's really bloody great, and I think will get the jersey in time, but it reeks of new toy syndrome to me when people start him.

Trump increased his relative support from all minority groups this election - racial minorities and LGBT people included. To dismiss or not even try and understand this trend is just willful ignorance. And it's dangerous ignorance if you're interested in stopping Republicans from winning in the future.

6919,2020-11-08 20:40:51,jqex7z,"We also can't just simply ignore how terrible of a candidate Biden was across the board. His history on LGTBQIA+ issues is atrocious, outside of just happening to be the VP in the administration that legalized gay marriage. Even in the ""08 VP debates he said that he believed marriage was meant to between man and woman. 

That's not to forget how many marginalized groups feel disenfranchised by the entire system. When Biden's solution to police violence and training police to de-escalate includes ""shoot them in the leg rather than the heart,"" a statement he's made at least twice, it doesn't give those marginalized groups a lot of hope or reason to vote for him. If Bernie had won, the phrase Black lives matter would have been explicitly used in his victory speech. In Biden's case, I don't think he's issued a single statement that's explicitly used the phrase but tip toes around it. In philly, about a week ago, he was asked to make a statement and his first sentence was ""I don't condone these criminals looting and starting violence."" He couldn't go out of his way *more* to alienate any true remnants of ""the left"" on his platform. Biden and Kamala both have a deep history of supporting private prisons and upholding the war on drugs. 

These are systemic issues that can be summarized by a few core problems in the U.S. First and foremost we live in an oligarchy, not a democracy; and we must seek to uproot the oppressive nature of capitalism from all facets of our daily lives. Until then, very little transformative change will ever occur and we'll keep bouncing back and forth between moderate Democrat and neofacist republican until our planet is no longer habitable for our species... and then we'll be done. Capitalism will always prioritize the need of short term corporate profits over the needs of the people. 

There are reasons to celebrate this ""victory"" but there's a LOT of work to be done with movement building moving forward. I hope you'll join us in that. But step one is, without a doubt, being blatantly honest about the person we just elected as the leader of our nation, what he's promised to his donors along the campaign trail, and how we can authentically expect him to govern. Let's not paint him as anything but what he his and insist that we deserve better. Let's be realistic about where we are so that we don't get complacent and idealistic. Behave as if trump still won, because *that's* the level of systemic oppression we are still fighting against no matter what.

6920,2020-11-08 19:26:07,jqex7z,You’re taking a few sporadic events to describe a much much bigger issue in the country. To say Trump votes are all motivated by racism or white people isn’t correct from what the polls show us. It is very real economic and class issues that drove such a popularity for Trump. Racism is more of a collateral effect. Most people don’t go to the voting booth thinking *I want Mexicans in cages*. That’s just silly and unfair to assume it’s what the standard Trump voter thinks. And I’m not a Trump supporter by any mean before anyone here comes for me. I’m just really interested in understanding the polarization of our politicians and how simplistic most people’s views of the other side are.

Throwing generalizations at an entire race before getting to the topic at hand tends to not enact much change of opinion - particularly about their racist actions. I’m not saying people need to be pampered with compliments before sensitive issues, but this is basic human psychology and has nothing to do with white fragility."

It's the same as when people seem to be surprised when they hear or see anything homophobic. I also think there's more to it than just white people not understanding the extent and frequency of racism: I think any reasonable person would be slightly surprised that so many people voted for a president who let hundreds of thousands of their own citizens die without lifting a finger; one who severely impaired the US's standing in the world and ability to influence; one who seems to have hastened America's decline and enabled the ascendancy of other powers like China, etc. There also seems to be a significant number of Hispanic voters who supported Trump because they erroneously, and, to an outside observer bizarrely, associated Biden with socialism/communism that they fled. The true broad story is that many, many people are just very, very, poorly informed, deliberately or otherwise."

For most white folks, we grow up being taught that racism was eradicated after the civil rights movement. We are taught that since the Constitution does not “allow” for slavery snd because technically POC have the right to vote, that everything is peachy. 

The truth is far from that. The affects of slavery are still felt. Systemic racism hasn’t gone away, it never did. The fact is that fear mongering and voter suppression are very much real. The system was made to account for slavery. The electoral college is a deeply racist institution that was implemented when slavery was not specifically outlined in the Constitution. And even after the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments passed, slavery never truly disappeared. It took the form of sharecropping, of mass incarceration and prison labor. 

America favors the racist institutions because they were never properly addressed. The Trump administration wasn’t an accident. It was a symptom of a deeply racist and elitist system.

I'm not going to HATE someone who voted for Trump and shares my sexual orientation, but I am curious to know why. If we just place blame on a group of people it will not ever change the fact that 71 million people actively supported someone who many of us disagree with. 

I also take issue with the assumption that we should just ignore the POC who voted for Trump. To me if we want to truly address racism we should aim to reach out to all voters (and people) of color not place blame or anger on them.

In my neighborhood a lot of anger comes from older families that saw ""color"" as the benefit over experience in their jobs for advancement. Many were bitter over benefits they felt were ""unjustly"" gotten by some when they were hurting and jobless. And most are downright racist having had little exposure to races outside of theirs.

Aside from rural voters and Bible belters, the vast majority of working class people don't need to be told not to use the n-word or any of the other slurs used against minorities. What they need is a Democrat caucus that truly represents their class interests.

They haven't had anyone offer that to them in 40 years. Until Donald Trump told them he would redraw all the rules in their favour.

For many, this was like a gift from heaven. They were going to get so sick of winning, he said. Trust him, he said.

At the same time a Jewish social democrat came outta nowhere to get within a hair's breadth of the Democratic nomination. But unlike The Donald, his rallies were locked out of the 24 hour news networks, the party establishment conspired to derail his campaign, and his policy platform was geared towards their interests, instead of just his words.

Bernie Sanders was never going to be President, but what he achieved over two election cycles was nothing less than the radicalisation of millions of voters.

""Oh my God I think America is racist!"" says the privileged. ""Yeah, I think my slave grandpa noticed"" replied his black friend.

I hope the existence of Trump's supporter base (even within minority groups) opens your eyes, people, that Biden winning doesn't solve racism or homophobia with the snap of a finger. These nasty things are definitely here to stay for the time-being and it's up to us to do something about it. Did Sen. Kamala Harris sit and wait to become the first female, Asian-American, Indian-American, WOC VP-elect? No, she broke a lot of barriers with her blood, sweat and tears for this groundbreaking day regardless of her controversial past as an attorney.

And finally I'd like to add that just because you are a minority doesn't mean you are exempt from prejudice. There is a lot of racism and transphobia within the LGBT community whether you like it or not. I get your struggles as a gay man because I too know what homophobia feels like and me pointing out shortcomings in our community should be in no way interpreted as an invalidation of your struggles, REGARDLESS of if you're white or not.

Re: the rest of it, that’s something I’ve had to come to terms with this week. I knew the polls could be off (and they were, albeit not by as much as we might have thought on Tuesday night), but I still found myself baffled that so many people could vote for four more years of this nightmare.

One of the things I saw – frequently! – during my doomscrolling on Twitter was that a lot of prominent black activists and voices I follow were repeatedly saying, “This isn’t new, this isn’t surprising, wait for the mail-ins.”

Eventually I had to come to terms with the fact that this country’s problems run deeper than I thought. Although I knew systemic racism existed and that it wasn’t uncommon or in isolated pockets, I was still *shocked* – I never doubted the outcome, but seeing the numbers was just... Horrifying. Perhaps I had a bit more faith in the average person than I should have, that they’d look at Trump and say, at *worst*, “IDK what I want but it sure as fuck isn’t that.”

Eventually, after ~48 hours of seeing a lot of prominent POC say, “This isn’t new, this is the America we know, but look over here, there’s some hope,” I stopped being depressed about it. I’m still shocked (and disgusted) that so many people saw the last four years and said, “Yeah, can I have some more, please,” but I sure as fuck won’t sit here being sad about it while people who are as (and in many cases, more) affected by this ignorance – often times more directly – are fighting and cheering and moving on to the next cause, and the next fight.

I find it no less horrifying, but I’m damn well convinced to not only continue donating to candidates who speak out against injustice, but to increase the amount of time, money, and effort I give them and groups like Abrams’ Fair Fight, Win the Era, etc., and to push back more against friends who have been donating to shit like the Lincoln Project (“because the memes are great!”), as those are allies of convenience, not conviction."

I don't think people necessarily like Biden or Kamala (Kamala has a very shady history with her involvement in prison sentences), they just voted for Biden to get Trump out. Don't get me wrong, Biden is the lesser of the evil, but I don't think he would have won if Trump learned how to talk with some restraint.

People were just sick of his narcissism and elitism and he thought money was going to hide everything. For a lot of voters, it did. However, not enough. He became his own worst enemy."
6962,2020-11-08 23:10:37,jqex7z,"I’m pretty sure the majority of other minorities were just as surprised as the gay community, as clearly stated by black and Latino “experts” and talking heads. So for you to come on here to make it seem that you have some type of special knowledge because you’re not white is just a pathetic attempt at trying to pretend you knew something all along. 

Let me tell you what gays knew all along: the overwhelming majority of black and Latino voters are overwhelmingly racist, have psychotic levels of barbarism and homophobia, are incredibly conservative and have KKK like tendencies which they’re ready to rationalize at any second (and I say this as a biracial person). I also remember black and Latino people (which you’re from) standing in line with smiles on their faces ready to take away gay people’s civil rights while crying about theirs. 

So yes, gay people have wisdom too, which you’re not ready to accept: that if republicans weren’t racist to a specific group (black people), they would overwhelmingly vote republican. White gays have done more for most minorities than any other ridiculous ethnic group who’s only stuck in the liberal party not Because they believe in the principals of the party, but because they believe they can exploit it (like your homophobic ghetto ethnic mom). 

Notice how cowards like him don’t go into their ethnic minority communities and try to lecture them on gay rights or how homophobia permeates throughout their community? Don’t ever listen to brainwashed people like him. Yes, we’re all very well aware why he was elected. And trump and his administration were far, FAR more homophobic in real material ways than he ever was racist but did you even notice that? No? Then you don’t belong to the gay community."

6966,2020-11-09 02:30:26,jqex7z,"It’s not the racism I’m shocked at. It’s the absolute sheer and utter stupidity. Most who voted for him did so against their own best interests. Trump never has given two fucks about the “average Joe” - he just knew he could manipulate them. His policy actions did nothing but benefit the wealthy. Additionally, the complete lack of empathy - to not care how he treats women, POC, the LGBTQ+ community, and anyone who disagrees with him. Ronald Reagan really started the “I’ve got mine, so fuck everyone else” movement, but JFC, how can you treat other people like this?"
6967,2020-11-09 02:36:14,jqex7z,"The best way I could explain it to my shocked friends was Trump and his presidency acted like the electrical jolts that drive up earthworms. He allowed deep-seated, previously hidden beliefs and ideas of mysoginy, sexism, racism, homophobia etc to spill forth without fear of judgement. And it might not be politically correct to say this, but the ideas upon which America was built and has maintained itself, from its origins as a haven for religious zealots and a  fight against taxation and throughout its history amd the present dealing with the murder and mistreatments of the indigenous Americans and the descendants of the slaves and other POC, are very much about perceiving themselves as superior and the chosen, the ""New World"", American dream and all that, and Republican ideals and actions are just a heightened version of it. It's those same ideals gonr to their heads and coming out ten-fold. I should know, as an Indian I have been brought up to believe similar ideas of a superior culture albeit based on its continuity, cultural values and antiquity. That's the same rhetoric that enabled a megalomaniac who abetted the murder of Muslims in a riot to become the Prime Minister."

6969,2020-11-09 04:35:58,jqex7z,"Many white Trump voters were definitely motivated by a very racist idea of national identity, political incorrectness, and exclusion. But it’s a piece of the puzzle that is resource and wealth hoarding—the idea that people within this country need to compete and “pick themselves up by the bootstraps” in order to succeed and afford life. The reality is that only a few manage to really succeed because they have a head-start through inherited wealth, which they use to twist the rules in their favor to become even richer. Instead of really seeing this country for what it is and critiquing it, Americans shit on the person that is beneath them on the totem pole. White people shit on POC, the rich shit on the poor, etc. Racism and capitalism have the same model."
6970,2020-11-09 05:22:29,jqex7z,"I'm not surprised,  I'm disappointed.  It's not like you have to go far to see he is a disgusting human being.  Watch 1 video over 5 minutes and you should be repulsed, but they still voted for him.  It's disheartening."
6971,2020-11-09 05:32:00,jqex7z,"I'm just an observer from another country but from whatever I've read, Republicans are not the party for minority rights. To take the example of LGBT rights, the conservative and Republican platform still holds that marriage is between a man and a woman, their conservative justices constantly speak against discrimination protections  (quoting religious freedom), they banned trans people from joining the military, they wouldn't grant citizenship to American parents' kids adopted abroad. No matter how much Trump says he likes the Gays, no matter which gay person he appoints to a top Intelligence position, it's very clear what his party truly stands for. Trump's not a conservative, but he still served conservative interests as the leader of their party.

But a record number of LGBT people voted for him and that's simply because they frequently themselves are not affected by these policy positions. They also lack foresight and take the fruits of progress having been achieved for granted. An anti-abortion, wealthy, gay Trump supporter in California with anti-discrimination protections who has no interest in marrying a foreigner and adopting a baby from abroad would not feel threatened by his own party's interests. There's no reason for him to care about women or trans people and he'll care even less about more nuanced issues like that of police brutality

For less well-off minority Trump supporters there's the deep seethed hatred for the Democratic establishment and a rebellion against political correctness and cancel culture. They've somehow convinced themselves that Republicans are the party of workers and not the elite they so despise. Republicans are masters of propaganda and misinformation and fear-mongering too. It was a true spectacle, watching them turn Americans' attention away from every other developed nation's social welfare programs, from their own programs like social security and towards terrifying sights from Venezuela. 

I don't see how anything will change. Social media companies refuse to crack down on misinformation, right wing political campaigns keep pushing absurd mischaracterisations, Democratic institutions will slowly erode and America's on an irreversible path towards 3rd world crazy."
6972,2020-11-09 11:42:39,jqex7z,Obviously but also rich people of color voted for him too. I have family who are American born citizens and they were definitely in support of Trump until covid 19 happened.

6973,2020-11-09 11:50:54,jqex7z,"It’s pretty lousy to realize that given a candidate who so obviously leans into racism in ways none in my lifetime has done that the numbers were so high.

One can make a dodge about taxes or whatever, but in the end it’s a damning number whether you equate it to racist intent or not because even if it’s not racist intent it’s apathy to the results of trump’s obviously racist intent.

The republicans have spent 40 years curving every local election and state legislature to their side, and until we fix ourselves locally their national grip is going to tighten and the aggressive leftist policies and anti racist policies that are needed are going to be out of reach at the national level as a matter of realpolitik.

Prompt stimulus, investigations into the trump organization, reinforcing Obamacare protections and fixing the holes in it.  These are the critical things because the American people need to see a felony land on trump to bar him running again, they need to see their immediate situations improve, and they need to begin to see clearly that their fortunes improve under democratic governments even as the economy always crashes under republicans.  That last point is critical messaging at the national level.

But none of it will happen unless the left gets aggressive at the local level and dislodges the gop from all these state governments where they have gerrymandered it such that it takes a record turnout like this to clearly represent the will of the people."

6977,2020-11-09 17:46:12,jqex7z,"Trump is the most popular Republican president in modern history, even more loved than Ronald Reagan. It's just that the hate towards him was even greater for a multitude of reasons. Sure Trump was willing to spend trillions to keep the stock markets stable, so that those who do invest felt that he was a success through the pandemic, but 40 million people who don't have any investments and who thus don't give a shit about it were left jobless, without private benefits that prevented them from having to go tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt if they got sick with covid, and many of them are on the brink of homelessness. He was willing to let all of those poorer people go homeless and die on the streets so that he didn't have to spend 100s of billions on them while he spent trillions for people's investments. This being left unchecked would have collapsed the housing market and then all of your investments would be gone as well.

 If landlords no longer have tenants because those tenants no longer can afford to pay with rising costs of living and a lack of a job, then all of the stable people with mortgages need to take on the banks' losses with rental properties being unpaid. And many of them are left unable to afford their mortgage and thus have their homes foreclosed in the end. Then they become the new renting class and you have giant homeless camps across the country where they never existed before. Trump was willing to make this the future just so that he didn't have to give poor people money to survive. You can hopefully see why the majority don't like him from your bubbles with this explanation."
6978,2020-11-09 21:51:19,jqex7z,"It's an indictment of our country that 71 million people saw fit to vote for Trump after everything he's done to harm people who aren't his gilded friends. This election wasn't nearly the repudiation of Trumpism that I wanted to see. 

We needed to make this election be such an overwhelming rejection of Trump and everything he stands for that there would be zero doubt that we want him gone. It wasn't anywhere near the case.

Lest I fall into the temptation to just criticize the ignorant people who slavishly worship Donald and everything about him, I'm also angry about the people who support him in spite of knowing how much of a piece of shit he is. Voting for someone that repugnant tells me enough about you that I don't want anything to do with you."

What's shocking to me is Trump got MORE support this time. Voter turnout was up overall, which is how Biden won. But 8 million MORE people voted for Trump than last time!

I'm not surprised that there are millions of racists in this country. I'm surprised that after all the disasters of the last four years, 8 million more people decided to vote for Trump than last time (for whatever reasons)."
6980,2020-11-08 21:33:53,jqex7z,"I don't live in the USA, but it's not difficult to see why Trump still got so many votes. Just look how much this sub loses it if a gay person is right wing, because you cannot possibility be gay and agree with anything right wing. Left wing politics has just gone very toxic with things like identity politics , and some traditionally left leaning people just want to distance themselves from the craziness and that does not make them racist or xenophobic, it just means the left has failed them."

6982,2020-11-08 18:53:13,jqex7z,"It’s a cycle. White people feel attacked when racism is brought up, so they deny it. BAME people then get more assertive about racism, which prompts white people to think they’re being over the top. White people and BAME people then anchor in, refusing to acknowledge the other side and believing that they’re taking the high ground. Both sides then pick the worst examples of the other side to prove their point. Both sides can’t believe how unreasonable the other side is being. 

We need to bridge the gap. While people need to stop being so defensive and open themselves up to learning. BAME people need to be accepting of people trying to learn and not be critical of people who don’t get it right away.

I think one of the worst things about leftist culture right now is gate keeping. If people honestly don’t understand or ask genuine questions, they’re often shouted down with “you’re racist and it’s not my job to teach you about race” etc which just pushes them back to their comfort zone of not trying to understand race issues."

He is also a terrible person, but I think people are willing to ignore that if he got the job done. But he just hasn't."
6986,2020-11-08 19:24:38,jqex7z,"I was only surprised by the increase in votes, I thought he would have lost a few because of moderates and independents defecting.   Apparently there was an increase in some minority and even LGBT voting, which is the baffling part.  There was an overall increase in voting this time around too, to historic levels.  But to support someone who appointed dozens of anti-lgbt justices, considers Mexicans rapists, murderers, and drug dealers, and is expressly against gay marriage is mind boggling."

6991,2020-11-08 19:33:15,jqex7z,"I think apathy about racism is more of a ""Non-oppresesd + non empathetic person"" thing, not a ""white skin"" thing. 

Where it is true that most white people aren't oppressed to the extent of others, many are still against racism becuse they are either oppressesd for different reasons or just have empathy for others.

Also saying apathy is a ""white person reaction"" shows that you miss the point of what racism is in the first place. 

An organ color is never going to be the reason that folk act in a certain way, so grouping folk like that never makes sense and only serves to make imaginary divisions between people."

When we talk about statistics we have to remember this is based on census data from the last census not as of today. Also white encompasses Hispanic or those that identify as white. Which in this case counts because trump also received a significant portion of the Hispanic vote, especially those that identify as white hispanic. As a POC I can also tell you racism exists between blacks and Hispanic as well. Including dark skinned Hispanic and white hispanic. It’s embedded in the culture only exacerbated by populist politicians and opportunists...that includes media."
6994,2020-11-08 21:18:34,jqex7z,"I'm white. I grew up in the lily white burbs of Chicago back in the 60's. Essentially no diversity. HS had 1 black girl and a handful of Latinos/Latinas. 

Yet, as I got older, went to University and then out into the world, I grew to have a very diverse group of friends and colleagues of all races, sexual preferences and religions, all of whom are liberal/centrists. 

I have a very hard time getting my head around POC, among other groups, voting for Trump, who is very transparently racist, despite what he has claimed. He was raised by avowed Nazi-sympathizer parents. We know how he reacted to the Central Park 5, calling for their execution, simply because they were black. He's imprisoned honest asylum seekers in *concentration camps* where a number of the women have been sterilized against their wills. And the crazed, bible-spewing, hypocritical Talibangelicals support a corrupt, immoral/amoral, pussy-grabbing, misogynistic pig. My list goes on and on, but I'll spare y'all that. 

Point is, I simply don't understand - nor will I *ever* understand - what possesses people to vote against their *real* interests and to vote for someone who is against every shred of morality and common decency; who doesn't give a rat's ass about them or their struggles and tribulations; who is completely out for himself and not the least bit concerned about any real issues facing the world. He essentially said to the white suburban women that he'll restore their suburbs to their Caucasian homogeneity by not allowing any mixed income housing, which is merely code for minorities. 

For him, it's only about seeking and maintaining his power. He's a wannabe despot/dictator. The only ones he's most concerned with are the top 15%-ers. What he doesn't realize is that he's just a tool for them, that they're using him because he's got the biggest mouth and the most visibility on the world's largest stage. 

There's other issues as well. If it's still on Netflix, I highly recommend watching, *""The Family""*."

Lots of the Mexican guys I work with are Trump supporters. Lots of people actually like the man and/or his positions despite the man, and a lot of people feel pushed out of the Democrat party as its swing so radically.

A lot of the ""hate"" you see is media manufactured. And a lot of the garbage you dont like and attribute to Trump is actually just dirty government BS and happened under Clinton, under Bush, under Obama, etc... but you only care because the media wont stop screaming it's a Trump problem. There's a big reason both Trump and Bernie shared a voter based but different policies, because they were from outside and would take on old problems in new ways.

And all the stuff I dud like that happened the past few years had nothing to do with Republicans or Democrats, but were all uniquely Trump and him doing things no one would before. On foreign policy its been a knockout once they got rid of Bolton 

I realize a lot of gays are very progressive and left leaning. I totally get that.

That white Biden supporters should apologize on behalf of the Trumpers because their skin color makes them share the responsibility? And when they give you that apology, will that make the problem go away?

The Republican party is a weapon wielded by billionaire robber barons intent on destroying the American Middle Class and Democracy and replacing them with a New Feudalism. They effectively take advantage of our large rural and suburban population to acquire and maintain power.

Everyone knows rural people are easily manipulated by social conservatism due to their ignorance. Their ethnocentrism is a direct result of this ignorance. You see the same thing in rural parts of every nation on earth. This is irrespective of said nation's predominate skin tone. Rural people are easily turned against minorities because they do not have the multicultural perspective of urbanites. In the US, whites are the majority so conservatives focus on black and brown people. In other nations and other times, the focus may be more on religion or ethnicity.

'Whiteness' is not the problem - social conservatism, and the ignorance it preys on, is. Its children are racism, sexism, classism, ethnocentrism, homophobia, etc. But the parent is social conservatism. You can't solve 'whiteness,' but you CAN solve social conservatism, and you do it by changing hearts and minds.

So whose mind are you trying to change, and how? Will your bitching at white Biden supporters make Trumpers change their mind? I doubt it. If you change your message / audience, you might have better luck."

7018,2020-11-09 07:10:04,jqex7z,"I think it's much more complex and nuanced than ""RACISM"" and just screaming ""YOU'RE RACIST"" at someone for not voting for the Democrats is absurd. 

I understand your perspective dealing with racism, but that doesn't indict all anti-Democrat voters as immediate racists when..... the Democrats are extremely racist themselves. Would you have the gall to call someone PERSONALLY hurt by Biden or Kamala's policies racist because they didn't vote for Biden? 

The Democrats cannot bring in working class people. And it's not because they're all racist. I'm sure that white people from small town Indiana are more concerned about themselves than the non-white people they will never meet. I think the Democrats (and perhaps the people voting for them) need to actually..... listen to Trump's speeches and hear what he says. He talks about lowering drug costs, about creating more jobs, etc. Of course certain people are going to be more attracted to him.

I don't like Trump, but I've been on a quest to figure out the problem and based on a lot of things I've been listening to I think it's basically this:

The Democrats are phony, rich snobs who benefit from being in the ruling class just as much as the Republicans. So, when poor working class people are failed by the Democrats, they default to supporting the Republicans because there's no true party that represents the working class.

Trump is attractive to people because he was literally anti-establishment, but still took over the Republican Party and won the presidency. He doesn't do the condescending ""when they go low, we go high"" bullshit. He's brash and loud and tells his opinion and he LETS the people in on the fact that our politics is a joke. That's why people gravitate to him.


This isn't just a Trump thing either. Leftist movements all over the world have been failing recently. There are countries all around the world who had leftist leadership for 20-ish years, but are now being taken over by Republicans.


So basically the crux of the issue is: we need to get rid of these establishment idiots who talk all day on social media about social justice, but won't actually implement policies to help poor people. We need a real leftist/Labour Party. That won't happen with the liberals who take corporate dollars and sign book deals and make all this money from just simply saying ""BLM"" and being sassy on Capitol Hill. We gotta stop supporting these phony, virtue signaling idiots.

Also, a majority of poor people are POOR WHITE PEOPLE in middle America. You're not going to win an election just talking about diversity and other shallow talking points. Putting black people or women in politics or at the forefront of corporations or in charge of movie studios isn't going to stop people from being poor.

The focus needs to be around healthcare, unions, and ending poverty. If we have healthcare, we aren't tied to our jobs. If we have unions we actually have power to make demands in the work place. If we aren't poor it will reduce crime rates, which will lead to less police (or people can move to areas with less police)."

- Asian people stabbed in the face and lit on fire? By black and Hispanic people? I know that Asians are targeted by Hispanic gangs in Los Angeles, but by white people?

Actually now that I think about it, it probably is the contingent of white men about 50-70 years old who find this just fine.

Yeah as if that didn't start during the Obama's era.. president literally has very little to do with this. Maybe passing the border illegally isn't a good idea, ever thought about that?🤡

It literally came from china lmao. We called the 1920s flu the Spanish Flu.. and nobody gave a shit, there are plenty of other viruses, flu and illnesses that are called after their original locations and nobody bat an eye until now when it's 2020 the year of cucks the communist China has unleashed this virus onto the world. Too bad that with biden around they will be left unpunished🤡

>It is no surprise to me that 71 million people voted for Trump

You're right it's not, I would say it's surprise that more people voted for Biden who cannot even complete a sentence and has a pedo vibe, but then again it's not surprising because majority of people are stupid, so here we are🤷‍♂️

>where as 10% - 20% of Black men and women voted for Trump.

Oh no I guess biden will be removing the skin pigment of these black guys because he did say black people who don't vote for him aren't, black.. you know Biden is an actual racist you guys accuse Trump of🤡

>On the flip side, the same goes for POC, not ALL POCs voted for Biden, some of them voted for Trump too. There will always be exceptions.

Why the F would every one vote for Biden, he's far far far from perfect, stop acting like he is, both candidates are terrible.. not even leftists actually like Biden, pretty sure majority of them only voted for him because they felt he is a less terrible choice(like I feel for trump) you're an absolute brainwashed clown"

1. Consistently vote GOP because most of those immigrants are descendants of capitalists in their home countries
2. Were turned off by the GOP’s labeling of Biden being a socialist 

Also, some people who are part of marginalized communities can vote against their interests. Many people knew that the Trump administration was racist, but voted for him because they saw no difference between them and Democrats in their ability to deliver economic change.

There’s validity to the idea that Trump voters weren’t all voting for him just because of their racism, but racism and xenophobia was definitely a part of the cocktail."

7063,2020-11-09 02:55:23,jqex7z,"I agree, but there's a lot of research in political science and persuasion effects in campaigns that show tiny or null effects so I think it's mostly a waste of time for Democrats to spend any significant amount of time trying to understand why Trump voters voted for Trump. They voted for Trump because he's a Republican. I would also caution against the same kind of armchair psychology that insists that studying the thoughts or feelings of Trump voters is anything worthwhile for Democrats to even consider, given the strong predictive effects of party ID on vote choice and the dwindling of cross-party voting. 

Instead, I think the new voters would be interesting, but is this increase in minority votes for Trump people who previously voted for Obama or Clinton, or are they new voters? If they're new voters, do they lean Republican or lean Democrat? If they're Republican or Republican leaning, then it's not at all interesting. If they're Obama/Clinton voters, but lean R, a bit more interesting, but not as much. If they're Obama/Clinton voters and lean D, okay that's interesting and Democrats should maybe look into why if they constitute a significant number of people to make a difference and they live in a swing state. If they live in a solidly red state, who cares? They'd be better off spending money elsewhere. It may actually be of more value for Democrats to understand what drove turnout among first time minority voters, like in Detroit or Georgia, or Trump-Biden voters. I have a feeling that any model examining Trump-Trump voters would show an extremely strong effect of party ID, which would surprise nobody. The particular reasons are largely immaterial and not worth studying for Democrats, again, because it's highly unlikely any of them would vote Democrat anyway. 

I also caution people against misinterpreting exit polls, because these are not the best estimate for vote choice. An exit poll is simply just a poll of people after they have exited the poll booth. It's not necessarily random nor representative. Keep in mind too, that *exit polls do not reach people who voted by mail*, which a significant number of people did in this election. Because of this, minority support for Trump may be overinflated. It may not be, we don't know yet. Automatically assuming Trump did something to reach minorities in 2020, when all we have to go on are exit polls, is a waste of time and nobody should bother discussing it until there's a clearer picture of who actually voted. It could be the case, after a more empirical and methodological analysis, that Trump actually did *worse* among minorities in 2020 than in 2016."

Good people tend to assume that most other people are good -- because that is their personal experience of what it means to be human and because they tend to congregate with other good people.   Idealists tend to assume that most other people are idealistic for the same reason, that such is their personal experience of what it means to be human and because they tend to congregate with other idealists.   People who are not racist tend to assume that most other people are not racist for the same reason.

They are not blind to reality, they are not living in a bubble, and they are not taking for granted ""white privilege"".   Rather, like all human beings of every ethnicity and race and gender and sexuality and etc., like all people, they are so attuned to their own natures that they have trouble imagining that anyone would be otherwise.

Genuinely good people have tremendous difficulty wrapping their minds around the willingness of evil people to do evil.   Idealists find cynicism intellectually comprehensibly but alien to their experience of what it is to be a human being.   People who are not racist can not grasp why anyone would choose to be racist because whatever it is that causes racism is not active in them.

And the same thing is  true for evil people, which is why when someone like Trump encounters a genuinely good or truly idealistic person, he is convinced that person must be lying or pulling a scam (or mentally ill) because being evil is his only experience of what it means to be human.

For that matter, this is why racists refuse to believe that anyone exists who is not secretly racist.   Since their core experience is life is a racist experience, they assume that everyone else experiences life the same way.   So when someone calls them racist, they find it hypocritical since they truly believe that *everyone* is racist."

We already know light skinned POC pretty much move in alignment with white folks when they’re a certain level of delusional. 

Good thing the point was that white privilege is an issue of numbers and an unearned sense of safety and entitlement built off of the backs of black and indigenous Native people. 

In any case, individual harm is almost a moot point under capitalism. The “more lax EPA policies” are not inherently bad, but in the context of the world being in the worst set of literal crises it’s been in as a result of human action and inaction (concentrated on the actions and choices of a very small subset of people) it’s another nail in the sinking coffin that’s full of nails."

We're spending more now under Trump for basic consumer goods than we were before, and this equals a net decrease in the amount of money we have in our pockets (totally cancels out the tiny little tax cuts he extended to working, middle class people). All those tax cuts went to the rich, end of story."
7132,2020-11-08 22:50:28,jqex7z,"> Correct!!! What this really boils down to is white economically privileged people refusing to think about the everyday American. ESPECIALLY the working class American. 

I'm a white male American, and I've been thinking about this a lot lately. IANA(Political Scientist). For almost all of American history it's been ""take care of the white Americans, scapegoat/exploit/oppress the minorities, and you can win elections."" That wasn't the only way to win, but that was the easiest way.

Then sometime in the 80's-90's I think we saw a change in the Republican party. They discovered they could extract more profits if they also exploited white voters too. Convince them to dismantle unions, support tax cuts (that benefited mostly the wealthy), and oppose any sort of social program (including Medicare/Medicaid and Social Security; something many rely on). Repeatedly I feel like I hear people say I (subtext: whites) deserve $SocialSafetyNet because I (whites) worked for it, but that they (subtext: minorities) commit fraud.

Rubes. Marks. Fools. We're in this all together. Either we all get these things or none of us do. The fiction that the Republican party cares about the white working class has grown blatant under Trump. He flat out says he's going to teardown things his voters want and they turn around and say ""I don't think he'd do that to me.""

> Which is exactly what sank Clinton in 2016.

I thought Clinton was fine, but she was the worst possible candidate to run in hindsight. IMHO what sank her had nothing to do with her policies. The Republican media machine had been (has been... continues to) ranting about her for 20+ years. From the first day they've hated her. It doesn't matter whether they were right or wrong, you can't overcome two decades of negative attacks on a candidate."

Within my own family people of darker skin were racist against my mother and siblings because we were lighter skinned and had more “European” facial features where they had more African type features. My mother and father were both mixed. And my mothers siblings were not (that’s a whole other story). Point is, they made out lives a living hell and always said we thought we were better than them... we were physically and emotionally abused for years until mom just packed us up with the clothes on backs and we left in the middle of the night and never went back. This type of racism exists in Asian culture, and all over the world. It’s been taught by generations of oppression and self loathing. The idea of loving yourself for you are isn’t a concept known by most white people because they’ve never lived a world where they weren’t accepted by their own culture simply because of their skin color or accepted into another culture for the exact same reason."

You say ~2x, but tbh I can understand (not relate!) why white people would vote for Trump. But minorities? Trump is racist and homophobic, why would any POC or LGBT person want to vote for him? 

So I find those 10-20% of POC voting for Trump more shocking than the 55-58% of white people tbh. 

And in general it’s sad that there are so many people in general voting for him. Not surprised, but sad (and relieved Biden got even more votes!)"

But from an electoral college/math perspective, there was more nuance in other groups than polling anticipated. If working on a 2024 campaign, there’s truth and value to seeing a more complex analysis of other minority blocks and their decision making process.

We can all do ourselves a little favor and stop viewing the Democrats as the good guys to the Republicans bad guys. In an oligarchy like ours, where our government is run by the absurdly wealthy, and all of our laws and decisions are designed to favor corporations, then there is no good party or bad party. It's all the same party. It is the powerful and repressive government on one side and the American people on the next. The only thing the democratic party is good for is pretending to be in oppisition of the Republican party, just enough so that the majority of us soak it up and vote to keep the same people in power."

You’re not going to change anyone’s mind by pointing fingers.

I think the real reason this is shocking is because the media acts like all Trump supporters are dumb, racist, homophobes, and scum of the earth.

It’s almost HALF of voters. Constantly insulting half the voter base is not going to win you supporters. 

It’s shocking too because the news acts as though these people are nowhere to be found, hiding in the woodwork. They are living next door, or in the suburb over. And odds are they aren’t racist POS, they just made more money or paid less taxes and only care about their own well being because other things don’t affect them. Calling them names is going to make them double down. 

Meeting them and expressing your difficulties has a much higher chance of making an impact. Similar to how a lot of people become more understanding of LGBT rights once they meet and know a gay person.

Clearly racism is a thing. People who think it’s not are ignorant, NOT evil. The people who embrace racism are the truly messed up or evil ones."

Yet when a POC person does something bad, lets say 9/11. Then all of a sudden ALL of Islam and Muslims are held responsible. Then all of a sudden Muslisms have to prove without of a doubt theyre American and their patriotisms.

I think they don’t have the organizational intelligence to do it well because their donors/think tanks are still all old Democrat institutions. Their marketing is way younger and more progressive then their policy making machinery. 

Democrats need to take credit for some of the programs that do work better too. Everyone forgets that the Obama stimulus was 100% passed by democrats. Not a single republican vote. The 2020 stimulus definitely needed 1) another round and 2) more clarity/access to lower income/minority businesses. Otherwise it was successful. And the democrats could have taken more credit as the originators of the idea as a trustworthy American concept.

Those are such red flags! 

But yes I know that there are other reasons why to vote for someone. 

See my other comment, where I clearly stated the reason why many Cubans in Miami-Dade did vote for Trump (as an example). 

Also I never said it’s a white and black issue. I was just stating that I’m not very surprised that 55-58% of white people voted for Trump - I was expecting that anyway.

As a dude from the Vietnamese diaspora, I can confirm that the majority of the Viets here in CA who voted for Trump come from the class of business owners and landlords. POC can uphold white supremacy if it’s a benefit to their class position. Pretty sure Franz Fanon wrote about this in Wretched of the Earth and Black Skin, White Masks. Definitely worth a read to develop y’all’s politics outside electoralism."
7259,2020-11-08 18:52:16,jqex7z,"Obviously yeah the majority did not vote for Trump, but to just ignore those voters and chalk it up to ""white people bad for voting Trump"" is pretty pathetic election analysis and doesn't really help you gain a better understanding of the electorate.

Truth is, Biden performed better than Clinton among white voters, and won the election because there are more of them in the electorate. Donald Trump performed better among latino and black voters than in 2016, and acting like he only gets support from racist whites is super reductionist to the point of absurdity."
7260,2020-11-08 20:28:13,jqex7z,"vote in favor of it?! Biden is not a communist! 

This is such a misconception, which was reinforced mainly by Trump unfortunately.

7261,2020-11-08 19:46:01,jqex7z,"Read my comment again. I never said that the majority of latinos in Florida voted for Trump. Of course most Trump voters in Florida are white. 

Also I was looking at Miami-Dade specifically: 

in 2016, Clinton got 63.2% of all votes in Miami-Dade (624,146 votes in total), Trump only 33.8% (333,999). 

This year, Biden got 53.3% (617,647) so far, while Trump got 46.0% (532,734), which is A LOT and not common in urban counties. 

This difference (200,000 more votes for Trump this year compared to 2016) is predominately by Latino voters. That’s a fact. 

Also I am not trying to blame Latinos here, of course most Trump voters are white people. But Latinos definitely had an impact on the outcome for entire state of Florida: if people in Miami-Dade would have voted similar like in 2016, Trump wouldn’t have won in Florida so clearly, it would have been a very close call."

Either way, it's a way to be inclusive for people who identify that way.

I am address to the people who are surprised about why Trump has 71 million votes. Like it or not the majority of voters are white.

White men and women make up 65% of voters and ~57% of them voted for Trump. Black men and women make up 13% and only 10-20% of them voted for Trump. Latinos make 14% of voters and about 30% of them voted for Trump."

They overwhelmingly do not use Latinx. In the US, 2% of the US Hispanic population use Latinx while 6% identify as queer. Even if all of that 2% is made up of queer Hispanic people, that means that at least 66% of the target demographic (queer Hispanic people) don't actually use it. 

Meanwhile in Latin America proper, most people don't use Latinx because Latino itself is only valuable as a contrastive term to the United States, nobody's go to self-descriptor is Latino.

Also pretty sure in this thread /u/Colby6736 said or inferred he wasnt Latin*. You can be Nicaraguan and not Spanish descended, you know?

Except this is the absolute mathematical maximum, by common sense even this is too high. Queer Hispanic people are not the only ones who use Latinx, it has gained some minor traction with straight Latinos. 

Also I am queer and Hispanic, most people do not use this. I don't even *mind* Latinx, but it is decidedly minority usage even among its target community in the US, and even rarer in Latin America itself.

This is just the liberal version of ""this is America, speak English"". Most of us queer Latinos speak Spanish and come from Spanish-speaking backgrounds.

7364,2020-11-08 13:36:35,jqazxm,I think we might actually go murder Gute if he takes an RB in round 1
7365,2020-11-08 14:28:33,jqazxm,"I agree on Chase and the giants, Slayton is likely to be a very good WR 2 but he'll never be the difference maker that the Giants need, and it gives no more excuse for Danny Dimes. 

&#x200B;

Giants may want more than that trade though, I think they'll be very happy to take Sewell at 2. Giants need a T, Edge as well as WR and ILB. QB and CB 2 are also big needs."
7366,2020-11-08 14:23:22,jqazxm,Dolphins don’t give up that much to move up one spot for a LT
7367,2020-11-08 16:12:44,jqazxm,"I couldn't disagree more with ETN to the Packers, that's one of the last positions they'll address in the first round"
7368,2020-11-08 15:04:48,jqazxm,"sewell and waddle in the first, sign me up for this"
7369,2020-11-08 16:29:56,jqazxm,"I would fucking die if we took a RB

I get it’s a mock, but the pick makes no sense. We let David Bahktiari walk in your scenario, and don’t address any of the weaknesses on the roster."
7370,2020-11-08 15:08:09,jqazxm,We suck at drafting so the packers pick makes a ton of sense
7371,2020-11-08 15:06:24,jqazxm,“Faucet” I always knew the Jets had bad plumbing
7372,2020-11-08 16:23:48,jqazxm,"Am I just missing something on Etienne? It’s not like he is bad, but I don’t think I have seen  anything that makes me want to leap out and take him in the first and I constantly see him mocked there. I especially hate the pick when I routinely see a guy like Hubbard available in the third. I think there is a really good chance he is the best back in the draft so it would make it even worse and look like a Rashaad Penny situation."
7373,2020-11-08 12:49:48,jqazxm,Jaguars will not be passing on a QB in the first round.
7374,2020-11-08 16:31:55,jqazxm,Parsons isn't making it out of the top 10.
7375,2020-11-08 14:18:56,jqazxm,The Jaguars have the worst O-line in the league. If they pass on QB and franchise LT the city will burn
7376,2020-11-08 16:24:11,jqazxm,"As a Viking fan, I would absolutely love this pick if it came true."
7377,2020-11-08 17:54:26,jqazxm,Yeah you 100% lost me with a Packers RB in round 1 lmao. The fans would call for Gutes head on a spike. That’s probably the move that either gets him fired or convinces ARod to ask for a trade.
7378,2020-11-08 20:45:55,jqazxm,"This may be an unpopular opinion but if I'm Miami, I pass on Sewell at 3 and just take Parsons."
7379,2020-11-08 14:58:44,jqazxm,Falcons would have to trade their 2022 1st to move up.
7380,2020-11-08 15:19:49,jqazxm,I like the trade for the Bengals but not with Micah Parsons still on the board.
7381,2020-11-08 15:55:43,jqazxm,Nice job. Look forward to seeing updates. The trades make sense. Being anEagles fan. They rarely stand pat. Sometimes they should. Any thoughts on their picks through out the draft ?
7382,2020-11-08 17:02:11,jqazxm,"As a Pats fan, I’m honestly terrified of Bill drafting a receiver in the first round. We can’t afford to continue missing on picks."
7383,2020-11-08 17:32:29,jqazxm,"Nice solid pick there! Our edge pressure has been our Achilles heel for years, and I am sick and tired of bandaids trying to fix it!"
7384,2020-11-08 21:50:05,jqazxm,"You might want to check your facts on the state of the Vikings OL. Ezra Cleveland is a baller as a rookie. O'Neill and Bradbury were good to begin with. Although Reiff is not going to be part of the long term plans, he's playing really solid right now and was not traded despite at least 1 offer."
7385,2020-11-08 13:48:36,jqazxm,"The issue I have with the Faalele pick is he could easily be had in the late second.

The guy basically can’t pass block, he would get ruined at this point. He has immense upside but I just don’t see him this early."
7386,2020-11-08 15:08:17,jqazxm,I'd rather go with Javonte Williams a few rounds later then go RB in round 1. Williams is just as talented and has less wear on his body.
7387,2020-11-08 16:30:41,jqazxm,"'Phins aren't taking a tackle in the 1st, bubba and projecting trades is silly?"
7388,2020-11-08 17:42:49,jqazxm,"I agree with most of the draft pick spots, but I don't see Atlanta trading up for Fields. It would cost them a shitload to get rid of Ryan, to the extent I think they are stuck with him for another year or two. Which I don't think is terrible - he's not been the problem tbh.

I can see it being Jacksonville trading up to 2 though. That might well end up with Sewell at Miami at 3, Chase to NYG at 4, then Surtain to Atlanta at 6.

The one I don't see going at roughly the same spot is Wilson. If things continue I reckon he'll go from about 8, and I think the Bears would need to move up that far to get him."
7389,2020-11-08 20:17:14,jqazxm,I like Pitts but nah dude we’re not taking another corner top 4. Fields or bust.
7390,2020-11-08 21:19:17,jqazxm,I can’t see the raiders spending a high draft pick on edge. They seem pretty set on their rushers and really need more help up the middle on all three levels.
7391,2020-11-08 22:18:25,jqazxm,Would rather the niners make that bengals trade
7392,2020-11-08 22:45:21,jqazxm,You have the Lions picking too low.
7393,2020-11-08 23:12:37,jqazxm,What are the moves you like from Rousseau?
7394,2020-11-09 00:49:20,jqazxm,"I do not see the Falcons trading up for a new QB. They're on the hook for a lot of money with Matty Ice, and their needs are plentiful on defence. Seriously, pick anyone on defence and that's pretty much an immediate improvement. Also, I'm pretty iffy on the trade valuations. This year's QB prospects are all really good; there are a decent load of teams with a need. It's going to take one *hell* of a haul to move into the top 3."
7395,2020-11-09 01:20:22,jqazxm,Id love Jaycee Horn
7396,2020-11-09 05:41:11,jqazxm,"Lions won't be picking that high, and if they take Moses I'm finding a different team to follow. I know they desperately need LBs, but Moses has looked like garbage this year.  He's a gamble at the end of the 1st/into the 2nd, if not lower right now."
7397,2020-11-09 14:13:18,jqazxm,"As both a patriots fan and A DeVonta Smith fan boy, I think Zach Wilson has to be the pick for us in this scenario. Cam isn't the answer. Stidham isn't the answer. The jury is still out on Hoyer but eventually we need to move on to the future."
7398,2020-11-09 15:00:10,jqazxm,The one pick I don’t like is Payne to the browns. Payne is 225 lbs and the browns run a 4-3.
7399,2020-11-09 18:38:34,jqazxm,"I disagree with trading the Jags a ton of picks to trade up for Sewell. 3/5 of the Dolphins o-line is made up of rookies (Austin Jackson is on IR), and LB is more of a pressing need, looking at how teams destroy them with the run. If Sewell falls to the Dolphins, I would absolutely take him in a heartbeat, but I'd accept them possibly reaching for Moses while also picking Waddle."
7400,2020-11-09 18:42:04,jqazxm,I am going to smash this point into existence: Trey Smith to the Ravens is almost a much of a lock as whoever has the first pick and Trevor Lawrence. He fits us to a T and is exactly what the offense is missing this year
7401,2020-11-10 09:37:58,jqazxm,The niners neeeeed Zach Wilson. Him with Shanahan just seems right.
7402,2020-11-08 13:39:12,jqazxm,"I really like it, solid mock!"
7403,2020-11-08 14:49:16,jqazxm,“Ron Riveria”
7404,2020-11-08 16:52:13,jqazxm,Thank you for doing these!!! I love mock drafts!!!
7405,2020-11-08 19:22:57,jqazxm,[deleted]
7406,2020-11-08 20:37:55,jqazxm,Earth is flat
7407,2020-11-09 01:27:22,jqazxm,What's your argument for Moses being drafted over Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah? The dude is clearly miles above Moses this season - who has not looked anything like a first round pick in 2020. I can't see Moses being drafted at any point with Owusu-Koramoah still on the board.
7408,2020-11-08 13:54:55,jqazxm,I think Rodgers would do that for you.
7409,2020-11-08 16:31:09,jqazxm,He wouldn’t be allowed anywhere near GB. He’d literally need witness protection if he did this
7410,2020-11-08 18:31:29,jqazxm,There is no way they should be taking a RB in the first after literally just drafting one in the second last year
7411,2020-11-08 19:37:35,jqazxm,"Its definitely a bit out there, but here's my reasoning. Bahktaria's going to demand a huge contract, as will Adams in a year. That means that the Packers will likely lose Jones and Williams as both will probably price themselves out of Green Bay. But Rodgers definitely still wants to win, and I dont have that much confidence in AJ Dillion right now. Etienne IMO is the most talented RB in this class, and generally there's no better single year boost to a team than an elite RB. He's IMO both BPA and the best fit if Green Bay wants to win NOW. Of course there are more dire needs, but I cant see most of the other players left at OL, CB, or ILB making the same impact year one Etienne can."
7412,2020-11-09 14:15:41,jqazxm,Even if you don't re-sign Jones? Him and Williams are both free agents and this frees you up to sign a WR and honestly I don't think your offense misses a beat going from Jones/Williams to Etienne/Dillon
7413,2020-11-08 14:48:24,jqazxm,"With Fields being available at 2 trading with a QB needy team and dropping to six it's definitely going to take more than two second round picks. It took three second rounders for the Jets to do that and that was supposedly a deeper QB draft. I think the Giants could get more than what the Colts got, but at the very least should get the same thing."
7414,2020-11-08 19:42:05,jqazxm,"I'd suppose thats fair. But tbh draft capital for trades is generally hard to project and Im guessing Jones plays OK enough to get 1 last year in New York, especially as he's Gettleman's guy at QB."
7415,2020-11-08 15:11:43,jqazxm,"Agreed, i doubt the Dolphins would trade up for anyone in the top 5. They can let the board fall and pick bpa. I'd love to see parsons fall to them."
7416,2020-11-08 16:06:46,jqazxm,"Totally agree. OL is finally starting to click this year, with three good dratftees (1st round included). I highly doubt that they would invest another high pick in the trenches next year."
7417,2020-11-09 14:59:29,jqazxm,"If the fins end up with the fourth pick they are either going to get Sewell outright or going to have a good amount of offers from teams wanting to move up and grab their QB3 (with Lawerence and Fields going 1-2). 

It seems pretty likely they will get a shot at Smith or Waddle with the Fins 1st rounder and I would take a strong look at Najee in the second (best pass blocking and receiving back in this draft). 

Dickerson would be a great pick up at center in the late second/early third if he falls that far."
7418,2020-11-09 18:43:57,jqazxm,"Especially sitting at 4, with another pick, they’ll probably just sit and take a WR unless someone offers them a nice trade."
7419,2020-11-09 20:37:40,jqazxm,"I don't even see why we would have taken that trade anyways. Sewell is looking like the best LT prospect in years, and LT is the second highest position of need for us.

The compensation is fair I guess, but the trade only makes sense for us in a vacuum."
7420,2020-11-08 19:07:57,jqazxm,Disagree. Protecting Tua is of utmost importance and the Phins dont have huge needs in their roster outside of EDGE. Sewell is definitely worth it to keep Tua upright
7421,2020-11-08 17:56:26,jqazxm,"If they were to ignore ILB, WR, DL, OT and CB just to take another RB. Gute should be fired before day 2."
7422,2020-11-09 18:45:04,jqazxm,Tbf we all said that with QB last year and look what happened. Packers draft board is just built different
7423,2020-11-08 15:12:22,jqazxm,Not as a trade up.
7424,2020-11-08 16:34:25,jqazxm,And ignore pass-rush some more?
7425,2020-11-08 19:01:26,jqazxm,"Bahktaria isnt walking? The point is that in order to pay him as a top 3 LT and keep cap space for Adams, the Packers let go of both Jones and Williams."
7426,2020-11-09 19:18:30,jqazxm,Adam Gase's brain is leaking.
7427,2020-11-08 16:53:20,jqazxm,"ETN lacks fluidity in his hips. He is a fantastic one cut runner and has great contact balance and top end speed. And I think he can be a very dangerous player at the next level as a threat to make big plays.

I am with you though I’m not seeing the first round talent there. 

Maybe due to the lack of top end RB depth he goes in the first."
7428,2020-11-09 18:47:31,jqazxm,"I see him as a late first at best, to a team like Pitt maybe, but I agree with you, he plays one of the most replaceable positions with the least value, and he’s not a revolutionary back, he’s just good."
7429,2020-11-08 19:06:23,jqazxm,Which QB are they going to draft? Top 2 are off the board and reaching for Lance or Wilson isnt worth it
7430,2020-11-08 18:56:18,jqazxm,"The Jaguars do not have the worst oline in the league, however them taking a corner here is absurd"
7431,2020-11-08 19:04:44,jqazxm,"The Jags dont have the worst OL in the league, and they have significant need everywhere on the roster. Moving down 1 spot to get more picks is definitely worth it"
7432,2020-11-09 18:48:47,jqazxm,"It’s not great but its not the worst. I have them taking Sewell with their first pick, then getting a QB with the later one."
7433,2020-11-09 18:46:05,jqazxm,"I wouldn't say to pass on him, but if I was Miami, I wouldn't trade up. We have 3 rookies on o-line, and Flowers and Karras are at the very least serviceable. LB is an absolute need, if you watch any of our games you can see we get shredded by the run. However, if Sewell really is the best prospect since Joe Thomas and he falls, pick him. If not, get Parsons."
7434,2020-11-09 18:53:13,jqazxm,"Not too unpopular, most Fins fans agree that EDGE and LB are huge needs"
7435,2020-11-08 19:03:30,jqazxm,Not from 2 to 6. Thats too much and Im predicting Jones keeps ups inconsistent play enough to where the Giants give him 1 more year
7436,2020-11-08 19:02:20,jqazxm,"Parsons is good, but OT is just too dire a need IMO for the Bengals. Protecting Burrow should be the first and only priority"
7437,2020-11-08 19:14:50,jqazxm,"Eagles probably still need a WR, and Id say someone like Olave R2 is reasonable."
7438,2020-11-08 19:16:14,jqazxm,"Well, BB cant keep ignoring the WR corps, especially as his trades haven't worked out recently. Whos going to carry the torch next year if Edelman cant play? They need to add a WR and Smith is probably the safest WR prospect on this class."
7439,2020-11-08 22:08:50,jqazxm,"Uh, Ive seen how the Vikings iOL has played with my eyes. Cleveland's been good, but he's only started recently and I'd like for him to keep up his play for the entire season before crowning him, not to mention he could very easily end up moving to LT. Bradbury has been OK, but Dru Samia has been a huge liability at at RG and Dakota Dozier might be gone after this season due to Cap issues with Cousin's contract. That leaves two possible holes on the OL, depending on whether or not Cleveland shifts to LT or stays at RG or even if he keeps up his play. 

Wyatt Davis would make the interior of the Vikings OL a legitimate rock."
7440,2020-11-08 19:18:44,jqazxm,"I dont think Ryan is bad. In fact he's still a very good QB. But I also think that the Falcons title window is shut now, with their defense and run gane being a shadow of their past self, not to mention the constant choking. Fields is not only a culture reset, but also a very good QB who could definitely benefit from learning under Ryan for a year if needed. And this might be the closest the Falcons ever get to an elite QB prospect considering their tendency to win meaningless games late in the season."
7441,2020-11-08 20:24:47,jqazxm,But Fields is gone by 3
7442,2020-11-08 21:25:23,jqazxm,"The Raiders arent actually that good at EDGE. Maxx Crosby is playing a lot more like a situational pass rusher and Ferrell isnt good at pass rushing. They have solid run stopping DEs, but they need to add players who can get to the QB."
7443,2020-11-08 22:46:42,jqazxm,Post was made before today's games. They were made with Tankathon standings.
7444,2020-11-10 06:24:48,jqazxm,Kwity Paye is 271. Who is Payne?
7445,2020-11-08 17:11:43,jqazxm,"""Every faucet"" this post is gold, and I'm not even paying attention to the picks."
7446,2020-11-08 19:19:49,jqazxm,My spelling is bad
7447,2020-11-08 19:29:29,jqazxm,Wilson is good but too risky at 9 IMO. And the Pats WR corps is just as bad.
7448,2020-11-10 06:31:46,jqazxm,To be honest I havent watched JOK's film yet so I dont know that much about him yet.
7449,2020-11-09 01:01:33,jqazxm,"Dillon and Ervin is more than enough to hold down the fort. Another RB would be a lateral move at best.

It’s also clear that Gute and LaFleur are looking towards the future, so another RB would be pointless."
7450,2020-11-09 14:23:38,jqazxm,I like the pick. I think Etienne would fit in perfectly for Jones and with another year AJ Dillon could slot in for Williams as the more powerful runner in that backfield. The offense gets cheaper without missing a beat
7451,2020-11-09 16:29:02,jqazxm,"With the other issues that have been plaguing this team for years such as no WRs and a major inability to stop the run, yes. I think we're far more likely to draft a new wr and try to get him familiar with Rodgers and Love than spend a ton on an older guy. Aaron Jones is also such a big part that pf our offense i have a hard time seeing us let him go"
7452,2020-11-08 21:29:38,jqazxm,"Yeah thats true, IMO if the move up is for a QB it tends to be more than average, as far as QBs unless its TL I don't see the point in the Giants taking one this year."
7453,2020-11-08 16:33:16,jqazxm,"We need pass rush, so, so bad"
7454,2020-11-08 15:25:12,jqazxm,"its a premium position and crucial for our future success

imo worth it"
7455,2020-11-09 00:11:15,jqazxm,I don't know but they sure as shit aren't taking a CB lol
7456,2020-11-08 19:34:01,jqazxm,Jacksonville will finish with the #1 or #2 pick at 1-15
7457,2020-11-09 18:48:08,jqazxm,"Idk about Lance, but I think Wilson is def worth a top 5 pick if you’re a QB needy team."
7458,2020-11-08 20:27:43,jqazxm," I mean at some point you have to add elite talent. You can’t just get more picks to have average talent everywhere. If you have the opportunity to get an elite LT, you do it and build around it in the draft and Free Agency or even trades with these 5th rounders we keep picking up. 🤷🏻‍♂️"
7459,2020-11-09 18:47:51,jqazxm,"My bad, I didn't see they traded up. I assumed it was the Texans pick."
7460,2020-11-09 18:55:00,jqazxm,"I only said unpopular because Sewell is an amazing prospect and supposedly can't miss. I don't think any prospects are can't-miss though. If you're picking #1 and don't need Lawrence, you don't take him or your trade back"
7461,2020-11-08 19:54:52,jqazxm,"Personally, I think Sewell makes all the difference here. I think the Giants need to be wowed with a trade (at least two firsts) to move and not get Sewell. Their line has been too porous and Andrew Thomas is not as NFL-ready as everyone thought he would be. Sewell is an instant upgrade to that line that is absolutely needed for DJ's future development.


Honestly, I think the trade that would have to happen is something closer to

Giants: R1 and R4 (2021)

Atlanta: R1 and R2 (2021) and R1, R3, and R4 (2022) or something closer to that."
7462,2020-11-08 19:03:42,jqazxm,Yeah but this is such a deep draft class for linemen. We could get solid players in the remaining rounds .
7463,2020-11-09 18:51:43,jqazxm,"iOL i believe is more a need than OT for them, Jonah Williams is playing well and Bobby Hart...well he’s atleast not the worst member of that line. If they’re within top 10, Wyatt Davis is their immediate pick."
7464,2020-11-09 01:06:44,jqazxm,"Nicely done. You're much more aware than I gave you credit for. I still read your post as the Vikings having a complete disaster for an OL and although I'd agree it's to early to crown Ezra, we can't say he's going to be bad either. He's basically looked like a pro bowl veteran in his only 2 games played."
7465,2020-11-08 21:06:21,jqazxm,"I agree with all that, but I think Ryan is good enough for them to rebuild with. The offense is still good and should be good for the next 2-3 years. I think an impact D player would improve them way more. I agree that Fields is the long term call, but I kinda think they are better seeing if they can cobble something together with the last few years of Julio and Ryan, then blowing it up in a couple of years. I think a current freshman QB is probably the Falcons next QB.

Plus, y'know, based on past history Fields would never win the job in Atlanta and get traded to Cleveland."
7466,2020-11-08 20:31:41,jqazxm,"We would find a way to get him over your trades is my point. Yes I’m biased. Also I’m naturally taking into account the current action. We’ll be #2 in about an hour.

Edit: well shit now NYG is choking big time."
7467,2020-11-10 13:02:13,jqazxm,I’m sorry I got him confused with someone else
7468,2020-11-09 14:21:11,jqazxm,"Ervin to Etienne is not even close to a ""lateral move""

Honestly if Green Bay let's Aaron Jones and Jamaal Williams walk this off-season I absolutely love this pick. Etienne is the fast shifty Jones replacement while Dillon is a punishing runner to replace the punch Williams brings. Both great pass catchers. I don't think the offense misses a beat."
7469,2020-11-09 17:26:26,jqazxm,I just think it's much better team building to draft an rb in the late first and sign a true WR2 as a free agent than it is to pay an rb a long expensive second contract and drafting a WR and hoping they're actually ready to contribute before Rodgers is gone
7470,2020-11-09 19:13:02,jqazxm,"I considered an WR but the Packers just dont seem to draft any. If they didnt pick any last year, then I just dont think they value the position highly. If anything I think the Packers might go for Allen Robinson."
7471,2020-11-08 16:33:52,jqazxm,Enter ogbah
7472,2020-11-08 15:27:30,jqazxm,"The way the line is playing I don't think it is, but we'll get more insight today when Austin Jackson comes back. Robert hunt has played well since starting."
7473,2020-11-09 20:39:00,jqazxm,Trading down from Sewell to take a CB at 4 about gave me an aneurism honestly
7474,2020-11-08 19:34:50,jqazxm,I used current standings to mock. They'll probably change over time but that doesnt matter here. Im not projecting how they'll finish
7475,2020-11-08 20:30:19,jqazxm,but Surtain is elite talent? Its not like you're drafting a JAG at 4.
7476,2020-11-08 19:13:15,jqazxm,"Sure, but just because its a deep draft doesnt mean you can just expect a bunch of Day 3 guys to become instant starters. Burrow was taking an insane amount of hits early in the season, and as good as Parsons is, an extra first and keeping the franchise QB cincy just drafted #1 overall upright is just too important. Even if Parsons becomes a superstar, its notnm worth risking Burrow getting Carr'd."
7477,2020-11-09 19:11:47,jqazxm,"I dont think a player not being hot garbage should mean they arent open to being replaced, and Leatherwood has enough flexibility to play OG and OT"
7478,2020-11-09 01:21:08,jqazxm,"Perhaps, but its still only been 2 games. If Cleveland can pick up his play for the entire season, then I'll considering a different pick here, but at this current point, I'd still say OL is the biggest need for Minnesota barring Cousins getting traded or cut. And Davis is legit that good. He's the best iOL prospect to come out since Quenton Nelson."
7479,2020-11-08 21:28:50,jqazxm,"Ryan is good enough for the short term, but they need a young QB sooner or later, and as recent years have seemed to show, drafting a young guy to sit behind your veteran QB is all the rage. Plus, Fields is definitely good enough to be honestly replace Ryan's production IMO, and although someone like Rosseau would be more of a win now move, I think it'd be smarter to give whoever the new HC is a fresh slate at QB. For me, this is a retooling move, trading out a capable but old QB for someone talented and much younger. And with the NFC south's top 2 so strong right now, punting a year wouldnt be the worst if it means they have the best QB in the division once both Brady and Brees leave."
7480,2020-11-08 20:32:55,jqazxm,"Well, this is based on the tankathon stats last week. If the Jags end up top 2, they're 100% taking a QB. That I agree with."
7481,2020-11-09 15:37:45,jqazxm,"I’m talking about our current offense, which is flawed in its own right even with Jones. Drafting Etienne would do nothing but spin our wheels in place for yet another year while we have some gaping holes in our roster continuing to waste away.

A RB in the first round would be a disaster of a pick and would make me lose all faith in Gute."
7482,2020-11-08 16:40:35,jqazxm,"If we're counting on that alone to solve our pass rush, we're in trouble"
7483,2020-11-08 15:30:29,jqazxm,"dont get me wrong, our line went from garbage to solid in just one year, still wouldnt want to miss the chance to get an elite prospect to protect our boy tua

flores is probably looking at other positions anyway, i am sure he will take micah parsons when he gets the chance"
7484,2020-11-08 21:27:42,jqazxm,Shit. Take my upvote and leave
7485,2020-11-09 00:15:12,jqazxm,We literally just took a top 10 CB. The second in 5 years lol.
7486,2020-11-08 19:15:44,jqazxm,"All that stuff is overblown. Yeah, the o line is bad but Burrow is the reason for a lot of hits and sacks but he is learning now. I didn’t say it had to be day 3 guys either. We could grab Liam Eichenberg in the 2nd. Parsons will never be there at pick 11 anyways so there’s no point in debating it anyways."
7487,2020-11-09 19:14:37,jqazxm,"They didnt take Leatherwood tho...

Also another mistake was thinking the bengals would ever trade anything ever lol. That team acts like trading is equal to shooting yourself in the head."
7488,2020-11-08 21:43:22,jqazxm,"For me though the problem is that they can't realistically trade Ryan. They'd take something like a $40m cap hit to trade him, and it doesn't go down much next year. And that kind of defeats the financial advantage you get from having a young QB. 

I agree with the rest of your logic, but financially I don't see how they can do it without just losing any advantage they'd actually get from it. Especially if they also need to trade up to make it happen. I feel like with that offense and those contracts they are stuck in a borderline-playoff-team-at-best position for the next couple of years."
7489,2020-11-09 00:16:05,jqazxm,"If they are 100% taking a QB in this draft at 2, they were taking one at 3."
7490,2020-11-08 16:42:09,jqazxm,"You made it seem like we are desperate, we are not."
7491,2020-11-08 21:38:18,jqazxm,Ogbah creating turnovers again.
7492,2020-11-08 16:45:58,jqazxm,"I think it is a more pressing need, we don't have a mike linebacker that can play the run and cover."
7493,2020-11-09 01:23:52,jqazxm,"Yeah but the Jaguars traded their top 10 CB and I havent seen much from CJ Henderson. And the rest of the Jaguars CB corps doesnt inspire confidence. Lance is a bit of a reach at 3, the Jags are set at EDGE with Chaisson and Allen, and IMO CB is a more dire need than WR or LB."
7494,2020-11-08 19:28:36,jqazxm,"But the entire Bengals OL was performing poorly, not just 1 guy. Ill give Williams and Jordan a pass as I think they should improve, but thats still an entire right side that needs to be fixed. Parsons could be the second coming of Ray Lewis and Id still think that protecting Burrow is more important because nowadays, franchises are made and ruined by QBs. I wouldn't even be opposed to the Bengals drafting straight OL for the first 3 rounds, and theyre getting an extra first."
7495,2020-11-09 19:16:32,jqazxm,"Oh wait mb. Well, Still, I dont think Bobby Hart can keep up his play considering his history, Radunz is a very solid OT, and dont they have a new GM? Might be different this era."
7496,2020-11-08 22:15:55,jqazxm,"I guess it depends on if the Falcons decide to actually reset for once or if they win a bunch of meaningless games again and moves out of range of the top prospects, which theyve done a lot of recently. IMO its better to be just rebuild than being stuck in purgatory, but we'll see what Dimitroff decides to do."
7497,2020-11-09 01:21:50,jqazxm,"No, because neither Fields nor Lawrence are falling to 3."
7498,2020-11-08 17:40:57,jqazxm,I’m a Phins fan too. We’re more desperate for a receiver/playmaker than a puss rusher but both are obvious needs.
7499,2020-11-10 16:02:39,jqazxm,Yeah? Who is the guy in our front seven that offenses are game planning to neutralize? Nobody
7500,2020-11-10 15:56:14,jqazxm,You think that is going to be normal going forward? You think he's morphed into some hybrid off JJ Watt and Robert Mathis?
7501,2020-11-08 19:10:11,jqazxm,"MLB is a need that can easily be addresses later, and Parson has also sar out a yeae which makes him more risky than Sewell due to 1 less year of film. Don't forget, Tua was injured very badly just a year ago. Making sure that hes well protected is important"
7502,2020-11-09 13:44:51,jqazxm,"Nah. If they are at three they will definitely be taking Sewell.

Fortunately they won’t win another game so the point is moot"
7503,2020-11-09 19:18:17,jqazxm,"Nope, still Mike Brown to the dismay of many Bengals fans. But the top two iOL are much better than any of the tackles after Sewell."
7504,2020-11-08 22:43:39,jqazxm,"Yeah, that's true. If I was interviewing for the coach or GM job I'd want to discuss that! Cos if they are doing that they need to be ok with getting worse before they get better, and I don't want to get fired for executing a deliberate strategy!"
7505,2020-11-09 13:46:13,jqazxm,And the Falcons aren’t trading up to 2.  But you still put it in a mock lol
7506,2020-11-08 17:42:15,jqazxm,I'd love to see waddle or smith with our second 1st rounder.
7507,2020-11-10 16:06:37,jqazxm,"I agree we need playmakers on the outside, but the Parker/Williams/Grant/Gesicki/Smythe/Shaheen group has not hurt us, we have a quarterback we have two cover corners, we have tackles, the only premium position we lack is a dominant pass rusher"
7508,2020-11-08 19:13:00,jqazxm,"Easily addressed? Easier said than done, its why we have trouble with mobile quarterbacks. Parson is a beast, don't pass on a talent that has been shown on tape. Tua has only missed 4 games. You believe the hype that he is injury prone but he was actually quite durable at Alabama."
7509,2020-11-08 19:50:49,jqazxm,Except Sewell is also sitting out this year
7510,2020-11-09 19:35:16,jqazxm,"Dont the Bengals run kind of a gap blocking, pulling scheme that's dependent on the iOL to get to the second level? I didnt love the fit there with Humphrey because Im not a fan of his mobility overall. IMO he fits best in a ZBS, which I thought the Bengals moved away from."
7511,2020-11-09 02:55:22,jqazxm,I like Olave a lot along with Waddle and Smith. He is an underrated WR in this draft class who has a very similar skillset to Smith imo. Rondale Moore is another interesting guy who would compliment Williams and Parker well. There are a ton of good options in the late 1st-early 2nd round at WR.
7512,2020-11-08 19:23:32,jqazxm,"Maybe, but that injury was a very bad one. As a Titans fan, I saw how a shitty OL destroyed Mariota, so count me as someone who truly believes projecting the franchise QB needs to be #1 priority, especiallt when most OL performances outside of the top 3 or so tend to fluctuate year to year."
7513,2020-11-09 19:37:18,jqazxm,"If they keep him at Center, they don’t really move that much in gap blocking, so he could still very well fit."
7514,2020-11-09 03:01:08,jqazxm,But would they have the chemistry with tua lile waddle or smith? Ha ha.
7515,2020-11-08 19:29:05,jqazxm,Dolphins have invested heavily into the oline.
7516,2020-11-09 19:42:30,jqazxm,"In the Bengals OL, Hopkins tends to move with Jordan when they pull though, and I dont think Humphrey has the lateral movement in order to consistently pick up the LB when the guards move. With the Bengals scheme that dependent on the iOL being able to move laterally and climb to the second level, IMO Humphrey just isnt a good fit and I think there are better Centers that will be available later for their system."
7517,2020-11-09 03:07:43,jqazxm,"Fair point, although I always wonder if NFL GMs would put much stock into those kind of things(maybe if you have two guys rated nearly the same)."
7518,2020-11-08 19:32:41,jqazxm,Nothing wrong with investing more. Especially on someone who's a near guarantee to be good. Dont forget OL play tends to be notorious unreliable year to year outside of teams like the Packers or Steelers and having good backup OL has never hurt.
7519,2020-11-09 19:47:02,jqazxm,"Personally I haven’t paid that close attention to their line because all I’m noticing is them getting run over every other play, so you’re probably right, but his value is still high enough to warrant him getting picked up by them. They also don’t draft super on scheme fit, I mean they took John Ross in the first and he doesn’t fit their WR mold at all. They also took like 4 different linebackers this year that all are completely different."
7520,2020-11-09 03:11:31,jqazxm,"Idk, I  wonder if they would ask tua."
7521,2020-11-08 19:35:04,jqazxm,"Doubt they will go thst route, especially since they seem to be following the patriots approach and that is rarely taking a lineman that high. There is no such thing as a guarantee in the draft, especially at oline too much can happen in the trenches."
7522,2020-11-09 20:00:42,jqazxm,"Maybe, but they seem to at least decided on an identity on the zone as a gap blocking scheme with the guards pulling a lot. I dont think they'd want to draft someone who doesnt fit at all in their scheme and would require them to completely remake the blocking scheme again in order to accommodate it. And generally you want varied WRs, as if you have a stable full of possession WRs who mostly excel in short-med routes, then drafting a speed threat will heavily open up the offense by pulling away a safety. The same doesnt apply for OL. Adding players who fit the scheme is a lot more important because of how much the OL must be in sync"
7523,2020-11-08 19:39:55,jqazxm,"But they literally look an OT round 1 last year...... As did new England in 2018. 

Also, the Patriots have one of the best OL coaches in the league. Im not sure of the reputation of the Miami OL coach, but I dont think he's at that level where he can turn late round guys into studs."
7524,2020-11-08 19:44:37,jqazxm,Hes doing well so far and I said that high as in top 5. I'm not going to change your mind but I think we don't go oline and draft defense with our first pick or trade down.
7525,2020-11-08 19:56:18,jqazxm,"But the Patriots have never picked in the top 5 with BB, so that makes no sense. Theyre usually title contenders, how are they going to pick anyone top 5?"
7526,2020-11-08 19:58:23,jqazxm,If they valued that position they can trade up.
7527,2020-11-08 20:23:51,jqazxm,"From 30 to top 5? Are you joking? The Patriots dont even do that for QB.

This is a legit horrible take"
7528,2020-11-08 20:26:21,jqazxm,"Patriots aren't always #30, I think you want to argue. You ou can come back to my comment next draft. Dolphins wont take the tackle, they have already invested heavily into the oline. Good luck to the titans. Fins up!"
7529,2020-11-08 20:31:09,jqazxm,"Alright, we'll see. But your comment about NE not valuing OL because they dont pick them top 5 despite being a team that's consistently in the 25-30s is still pretty garbage."
7530,2020-11-08 20:31:33,jqazxm,Nah
7531,2020-11-08 20:33:10,jqazxm,"K man, whatever you say."
7532,2020-11-07 23:19:44,jpy084,"Out of curiosity (I'm Hungarian American, raised and currently living with my Hungarian grandma), does anyone know if Beverly spoke Hungarian or how connected her family was to the Hungarian community in Cleveland at the time? I know that as a kid I was very shy and my grandmother basically raised me to only trust our circle of Hungarian close friends/family. I think it's important to note that this was right before the Revolution happened in 1956, which led to more Hungarians settling in America afterward. I thought maybe the influx of new people to the community might be something to look into, but simply not the case in 1951. However, this is just my personal experience, Hungarians care very much about other Hungarians and tend to know intimate details about each other's family life and dynamics (to the point of gossip). May be a possible avenue to explore. Great write up!"
7533,2020-11-07 23:47:28,jpy084,"Great write up! Poor Beverly. I really like the detail that her mother didn’t call her a surprise but a miracle. 

Even when I understand the woman who wrote the letter was desperate to run from an abusive relationship, I think it’s extremely cruel to use a missing child as bait to get revenge."
7534,2020-11-08 03:49:52,jpy084,"Excellent write up.

I always felt it was some kind of drifter associated with the Showagon.

I sadly don’t think this will ever be solved."
7535,2020-11-08 04:20:55,jpy084,Thanks. I love well-written posts that are long on detail and citations. I look forward to part 2!
7536,2020-11-08 07:34:27,jpy084,"Great write up, when I learned about her disappearance before there was more focus on  the short woman with her hand on Beverly's shoulder and less information about all the other possible leads.  Thank you for putting it all into perspective, perhaps the woman was not a lead at all!   I wonder if that information was why Beverly's mother was convinced a woman abducted her daughter?  Or was there another reason her Mother thought that?"
7537,2020-11-08 14:30:41,jpy084,"This write-up is fantastic. I really like getting a sense of who Beverly was, as well as her family. 

I will never understand people who harass and pull cruel hoaxes on families who have lost a child or a family member."
7538,2020-11-08 05:39:04,jpy084,A wonderfully detailed and insightful writeup. I look forward to Part 2.
7539,2020-11-07 22:24:36,jpy084,Excellent work!
7540,2020-11-09 03:26:13,jpy084,A great write up. Am off to read Part 2.
7541,2020-11-09 04:19:55,jpy084,Your write ups are always so detailed and well researched. Thank you for what you do!
7542,2020-11-10 20:12:08,jpy084,"Fantastic write up 👏🏼
Next part due?"
7543,2020-11-09 18:32:59,jpy084,"Amazing article/wrap up! 

Does anyone else find it odd the extreme detail of the clothing listed? Who knows the elastic of the panty that your kid wear?"
7544,2020-11-07 22:53:47,jpy084,Excellent write up so far.
7545,2021-04-23 10:32:09,jpy084,Wow. Very sad. How cruel to prank the family like that so many times no matter what situation these other people found themselves in.
7546,2020-11-08 00:38:23,jpy084,"Those are some good questions. The family was somewhat close to the Hungarian community as many of the Potts relatives lived with them in the home after immigrating from the old country. I doubt Robert Potts spoke Hungarian as his family was English. I don't know if the girls spoke Hungarian. Strangely, online no one seems to know this fact about Beverly's  heritage and I only discovered it in books about the case. Let me know if you find anything out."
7547,2020-11-08 00:39:58,jpy084,"Thank you for your kind words. I agree about that detail. It really shows that Beverly's family cared for her deeply and didn't resent having a baby so late in life. 

I also have to agree about the letter. I think it was a cruel thing to do the Pott's family, even if the woman was in a hard situation."
7548,2020-11-09 13:27:46,jpy084,"My impression is that the Showagon was a city-wide talent show of mostly local teens that went around to different parks all within the same city.

Do you think that a drifter saw one and then decided to stay in the city to go to the other dates?"
7549,2020-11-08 05:53:34,jpy084,Part 2 is up!
7550,2020-11-08 13:36:57,jpy084,"The family said that Beverly was shy around boys and men, so the mother may have believed that she was more likely to trust a woman."
7551,2020-11-08 21:21:02,jpy084,"I think her mother thought that Beverly knew about the dangers of unknown men, but never thought of women as a threat, which is why the theory of a female abductor is a popular one. However, this doesn't change anything if the person who abducted Beverly was a person she knew. 

Sadly, I think this was just how Elizabeth expressed her guilt. She felt guilty for Beverly's disappearance and felt as if she had failed as a mother :(."
7552,2020-11-08 21:21:25,jpy084,I agree. It is so cruel.
7553,2020-11-08 05:59:46,jpy084,Thank you so much! Part 2 is up.
7554,2020-11-07 22:47:48,jpy084,Thank you for your support

7558,2020-11-11 15:01:15,jpy084,"I do!  I buy the clothing and wash it, fold it and put it away. Although I generally know what they wear when they leave the house, I couldn’t say if any one item was missing. They have a LOT of clothing, thanks to cheap retailers like H&M.  I think that, back then, kids didn’t have as much clothing: a pair of jeans, a few tops, a few sweaters and one coat."
7559,2020-11-09 20:54:23,jpy084,"I initially thought that was weird, But her family was made to do an extreme inventory of her closet in order to weed out false confessions. As for the underwear, for example I thought that was super weird especially since Beverly was 10 years old and not a young child. However apparently the Potts actually went to the store found the underwear they bought for Beverly and got a perfect description that way. Hope that makes sense. Edit-grammar"
7560,2020-12-07 22:02:38,jpy084,"Back then, clothing was more expensive than it is now, relatively speaking. There was no fast fashion or cheap stuff imported from China, and most people had less clothing than we do today, and replaced it less often. Also, many people still made at least some of their clothes at home."
7561,2020-11-07 23:09:44,jpy084,Thank you!
7562,2020-11-08 00:54:20,jpy084,"I'll start googling her name in Hungarian and look into her mother's maiden name to see who came over from Hungary etc. Hungary has extensive records on citizens so it might be easier than thought, but of course, Hungarian is one of the toughest languages for an English speaker to learn (My grandma didn't teach me when I was younger, but I went to Hungary on a scholarship and know basics now, have family there, got my citizenship etc). I am very surprised to not see much from the Hungarians on this because of the sense of community. Of course, the xenophobia was very strong back then so maybe they kept this to themselves or took care of it themselves (maybe, just a theory based on Hungarian traditional views). I'll update if I find anything!"
7563,2020-11-10 23:10:27,jpy084,That’s why a “drifter” doesn’t sit well with me because the Showagon is not really a carnival with workers etc.

7626,2020-11-07 16:27:52,jpkg0k,"Don’t see why Philly would need to salary dump Horford. Absolute worst case scenario they can find a trade for a player who fits better but has an equally terrible contract.

If I’m Philly I would seriously consider packaging Thybulle and Horford for Chris Paul. I feel like Thybulle beats any other return OKC would get for CP, and I think he’s more valuable than all the assets they would get from your proposed Knicks trade. But this all rests on Philly being willing to trade Thybulle, perhaps they are too enamoured with him to do so."
7627,2020-11-09 12:45:15,jpkg0k,"Ok I'll go trade by trade.

&#x200B;

Trade 1:

I like it a lot for OKC, getting young players and a pick for CP3 is the kind of deal they should look into, especially if they can do it without taking back bad salary.

I like it less for the Knicks, unless they combine it with another move or two and bring in an all star. I don't like the idea of CP3 getting pissed off because the team just isn't particularly good. I feel like he is a great locker-room presence on teams where they are winning, I'd worry about his personality if the team was flailing around 30 wins.

Trade 2:

Is it crazy to say the Nets can do better for Levert? It feels weird to say it, but after all these injuries, I think if I'm Indiana and that trade is on offer, I grab it and run. How good is Oladipo going to be next year? No idea honestly, and with only one year left on the contract I would be scared about what happens next offseason when I'm capped out and Dipo has all the leverage.

Trade 3:

I'm very high on Turner, so I wouldn't touch this one if I was Indiana. I think he is good enough to be a starting centre on a championship level team, I wouldn't give up on him because the spacing and defense he provides is just such a unique combination. If I was going to move one of the bigs in Indiana, it would be Sabonis. I don't think his value will ever be higher.

For Boston, I'd do it in a heartbeat. A closing 5 of Kemba/Brown/Smart/Tatum/Turner is insane on both ends.

Trade 4:

If I'm LA, why am I including Milwaukee? I'd just rather swap Green for Dinwiddie. Dinwiddie's upside is significantly higher tha Bledsoe's imo, and I think he'd feast as a secondary threat with the starters/running the bench offense when James sits. Love the fit of Dinwiddie on LA tbh.

For Brooklyn, I think I can probably do better than Green for Dinwiddie? Like maybe Aaron Gordon?

If I'm the Bucks I'd do it, I think Dinwiddie is a much better fit with the team than Bledsoe.

Trade 5:

Is this Philly just dumping Horford into space? AFAI can tell the Pels don't have anywhere near enough cap space to just take Horford on, don't think its legal. The most cap space the Pels can get to is about $23 million, and thats if they jstu dump ingram (obviously not going to happen.

The Pels aren't giong to be a cap space team, so unless they send back Jrue Holiday, the trade isn't legal."
7628,2020-11-07 05:18:19,jpkg0k,"That second trade is beyond garbage. Trading an all star level talent for a mere but respectable bench player. That fourth race is interesting, though not sure if Brooklyn is interested in replacing Spencer with Green. The first is definitely most likely to happen, and I think that Smith can rebound with a fresh start in OKC."
7629,2020-11-08 19:33:48,jpkg0k,"What’s the reasoning behind just salary dumping Horford? We can’t do anything with the money saved anyway, and could use him almost exclusively as the backup because he fits better with Simmons. We can just run that lineup if we wanted to anyway."
7630,2020-11-07 14:56:38,jpkg0k,"The first two trades absolutely work.

The Knicks have the cap space to absorb Chris Paul's contract.

And the reason the 2nd trade doesn't work in the Trade Machine is because it hasn't taken into account LeVert's extension."
7631,2020-11-09 21:50:47,jpkg0k,"While this is a “possible trade”, I don’t think this trade is realistically possible.

While a trade package of Horford + 2 picks + Thybulle might be the best offer for Paul, I don’t think the Sixers management would allow it. 

Currently the sixers are ~15m over the tax. So they have a tax bill of around 63.75m. Which is already way to fucking high. But if they traded for Paul, they would be taking on EVEN more salary. 

Let’s say they did something like 

Horford + Thybulle + Zhaire + Scott to cut it even more, you’re still adding an extra 3m in salaries BEFORE minimums. So it turns into ~something like 21m over the cap, or a tax bill of 95m. 

But what’s even worse is that the cap isn’t going up next year, but the players salary’s are all going up. 

The year afterwords they would be locked into 162.1m in salaries while only have 6 players signed to the roster. That’s a tax bill of ~271m!!!!

Basically if they trade for Paul they are locking themselves into a MASSIVE tax bill for the next couple of seasons, because they can’t get out of Tobias, Paul, Embiid, or Simmons (I mean they could but it wouldn’t be good)"
7632,2020-11-09 21:56:19,jpkg0k,"Yes I completely agree, I don’t like any of the trades asides from maybe the Indiana one. I think it could work for either side because Dipo and LeVert have massive variances in perceived value. 

The bucks trade, doesn’t value dimwiddie nearly enough. He’s not a role player, but a legit 3rd option on a championship team. (Maybe slightly worse). But at the worst he’s a premier starter. 

Knicks trade, doesn’t make sense from the Knicks point of view. I think that giving up value for Paul just doesn’t make any sense. Like why even trade Porzingis if you’re just going to use that to get the end of Chris Paul? 

Agree on Turner completely, there are DEFINITELY better options available for him if you’re looking to trade him.

What does dumping Horford actually get the Sixers? They won’t have cap space, and they aren’t getting anything in return. Even if Horford is overpaid, he’s better than a minimum guy. So you’re just saving ownership money at the cost of 2 draft picks."
7633,2020-11-07 05:57:28,jpkg0k,"LeVert is easily a starting caliber talent, and Oladipo has been an all-star level talent a grand total of one season in his career. Every return from injury has had him looking bad offensively, and noticeably a couple steps slower on defense. Not to mention Oladipo is a flight risk rental for virtually any team that he does not name an ideal destination, so Indiana has almost zero leverage in Dipo trades. LeVert on the other hand has a reasonably priced contract and is locked in for 3 years. He's been better than Dipo coming off injuries, so the team taking Dipo is taking the bigger risk with the bigger potential reward here.

A Dinwiddie for Green swap is going to leave Brooklyn's bench bare with almost zero shot creation and playmaking left if LeVert also gets traded. Green is not worth Dinwiddie or Bledsoe either, if LA gives up Caruso it would be a more reasonable deal, which they probably won't because they need all the cheap help they can get, and Caruso won't fill the playmaking void for Brooklyn's 2nd unit. Would fit pretty well beside Kyrie since he moves off-ball, and Brooklyn has enough spacing to have his almost non-existent distance shooting volume not affect the offense. Brooklyn doesn't want picks, so another player should be tossed into the deal."
7634,2020-11-07 09:43:48,jpkg0k,Surprised to see this take. The Nets are the ones losing that trade in my eyes. Dipo is a one time all star who has injury concerns and is unlikely to return to all star level. That factored into him wanting a big pay day is less reason to trade him for a younger Levert on his contract who gives you similar impact to Dipo or arguably more at this stage if he can't retain his all star form.
7635,2020-11-07 05:51:22,jpkg0k,Caris is more than a ‘respectable bench player’

7638,2020-11-09 23:35:19,jpkg0k,"I’m not gonna discredit the salary stuff, but I think the implied trade was Thybulle and Horford for CP3 straight up."
7639,2020-11-07 12:16:00,jpkg0k,"> LeVert is easily a starting caliber talent

I dunno. He puts up numbers but isn't terribly efficient at it and has been hurt a lot. His eFG the last three years has been under 50, TS% is below league average, and hasn't played a full season since '17-'18.

He's probably more valuable in the role of 6th man/key reserve on a legit playoff team than being a starter."
7640,2020-11-07 14:59:11,jpkg0k,"> A Dinwiddie for Green swap is going to leave Brooklyn's bench bare with almost zero shot creation and playmaking left if LeVert also gets traded

You have Kyrie/Oladipo/KD, you stagger them so 2 of them are on the floor at all times."
7641,2020-11-07 12:18:00,jpkg0k,LeVert is arguably as injury-plagued as Oladipo (he missed 69 games the last two seasons).
7642,2020-11-07 05:57:43,jpkg0k,"Respectable role player. But for Vic, cmon now.."
7643,2020-11-07 15:03:40,jpkg0k,"> For the Lakers, swapping Danny Green for Eric Bledsoe is an acknowledgement that another PnR ball handler is needed to help ease pressure off LeBron. They tried repeatedly this past year to get said player, looking into Reggie Jackson and Darren Collison, however came up empty in their search. 

Bledsoe also gives them a great point-of-attack defender to defend the numerous lead guards in the West such as Steph Curry, Jamal Murray, and Dame Lillard."
7644,2020-11-07 16:47:03,jpkg0k,"Knicks decline the team options on Bobby Portis, Taj Gibson, and Wayne Ellington, that opens up 34 million in cap space. 

DSJ + Ntilikina combined make 11.8 million, meaning that there is enough space to absorb CP3's 41 million salary into that space.

However, I see your point about not having enough cap space to then sign Christian Wood, so in that instance, Julius Randle would have to be included into the trade, in order to free up that space if the Knicks wanted to pursue him. 

As for the 2nd trade, that is easily remedied, all the Nets have to do is add a minimum salary contract in and the trade works."
7645,2020-11-10 04:24:44,jpkg0k,"But that’s what I mean, that means you’re EVEN MORE in tax hell. Even in a case where you shed as much “useless” salary as possible you’re still in a situation where I t doesn’t work.

Also, no one is taking Horford for just Thybulle. I just don’t think it’s enough value. But that’s besides the argument being made here."
7646,2020-11-07 13:13:38,jpkg0k,"Most 6th men are starting caliber talents, they simply work better in a specialized role where they can dominate the ball and have their weaknesses hidden when playing with and against other 2nd units. Levert and Dinwiddie best project as 6th men because of their playstyle and skillset, but they are capable of starting. There is still value in volume scoring even below league average efficiency, otherwise Allen Iverson wouldn't be touted as some bigshot. Shots have to be taken, and at least Levert brings value as a playmaker. 

Plenty of starters in the league and throughout it's history have been placeholder starters while superior players come off the bench."
7647,2020-11-07 15:41:08,jpkg0k,"Staggering sounds easy in theory but its not an answer to every game because the Nets won't always dictate the situation. Matchups play a big role  there. In the playoffs everyone plays a ton of minutes anyway so this won't be as big an issue. 

Across the season though the bench has to be serviceable, especially with all 3 of them coming off major injuries, and nobody expects any of them to play every single game, much less without minute restrictions. Maybe they get a load management program with Brooklyn's medical staff who knows."

7649,2020-11-09 12:47:53,jpkg0k,"Oladipo has had a couple of very bad injuries in terms of replicating level of play pre-injury for NBA players. 

&#x200B;

Honsetly if Im the Nets I see if I can do better than Dipo, especially for just one season before he starts asking for $100+mil which I would be terrified to give him with his injury history."
7650,2020-11-10 05:35:23,jpkg0k,"Unrelated to CP3 and the Thunder, Thybulle and Horford for nothing would actually be a solid trade for the receiving team. They would be giving a flat $30m each year to Al Horford and Mattise Thybulle for 3 years as the cap increases and each of those dollars mean less and less. If Horford and Thybulle were on the open market, there would be teams willing to pay them a combined $30m per year for the next 3 seasons, especially if it granted them Thybulle’s rfa rights."
7651,2020-11-10 13:23:11,jpkg0k,"Usually cap space costs ~1 protected first for every ~15-20m per on cap space used. And that’s usually for 1 year. Horford is for 3 years so teams just have better uses of cap space than just getting Thybulle. 

But regardless the cap will not be going up over the next 3 seasons so it’s a moot point anyways."
7652,2020-11-10 17:37:37,jpkg0k,"It also depends on how much of the contract the player is worth. Horford is still a very good starting center and is worth most of his contract. As for the salary cap, the NBA announced that it will increase by 3-10% after this season."
7653,2020-11-07 01:52:17,jpi6dt,"I am friends with my husband's long term ex so I know what this all about. I have one question which will help me give you an answer to this: ""Why is he no longer with her?"" (and give some details)."
7654,2020-11-07 02:37:50,jpi6dt,"It sounds like a song about being finally able to let go of someone and get over them romantically but honestly it was like nails on a chalkboard to listen to it so I am not too sure.  Maybe seeing him happy with you and realizing she has issues with the current guy has given her some clarity on the reality of relationships vs high school first love and also  on her own personality needs compared to people she has been with and how it was not a good match though the feelings were strong.  

You would not want to be completely blind to a possible backstab from anyone these days but being too hypersensitive is not the balance you want either.    I would let it pass but you could leave the chat up and he can see it was delivered to you nbd if it makes him uncomfortable then he will be the one to interpret it or ignore it."
7655,2020-11-07 01:56:01,jpi6dt,"So this is the one thing in a year and a half that's remotely questionable in your mind?  Either way, unless you have reason not to trust either of them, you're making something out of a whole lot of nothing here."
7656,2020-11-07 01:53:59,jpi6dt,"He said she is crazy, they argue too much. That it was constant annoyance and depression. All they did was fight. That she is the one person who can push all of his buttons and drive him mad. She is very uptight and he is laid back."
7657,2020-11-07 02:23:30,jpi6dt,"Okay, that helps. Here are a few things you should know, and I say this from knowing my husband's ex for 14 years now:

1. They will always have a ""love"" for each other. It's not the same as your love with him, it's absolutely different and it's in the past but it connects them. Luckily, most guys categorize stuff and relationships go in a bucket of it being over and done with.  

2.  Whether you like it or not, she will find little jabs to get in from time to time. Jabs can be a little comment of ""oh yeah, he did that with me all the time"" to the song she sent him. She sent him the jab to hold on to the connection she had with him but if he doesn't feel the same, it is null and void because it doesn't make the impact that she wanted. 

3. She will always be in a slight competition with you. You will notice that she will somewhat copy you when she sees her ex reacting favorably to it. For instance, here is what happened to me. When I was first got proposed to on my birthday, her boyfriend suddenly proposed to her 1 week later!! We set an initial date, theirs was exactly 1 month before ours. We actually changed it later due to covid and we couldn't go to theirs as covid was hitting hard!

To be honest, I never feel like I'm in competition with her because I'm not and in general not that kind of person. I'm not jealous of her either. When I first met my husband, he told me all about her. He said that he was still friends with her and told me all about their relationship. After I got to know her, I asked for her version and it was different and a bit sadder. One of the things my husband told me that there was one reason why he never married her, she wasn't ""the one."" At first, I was a little taken back thinking that he would string me along but he didn't. He told me the first time I got together with him that he was in love with me. One of the things I found out much later is that he never told his ex that much that he loved her. She was the one who told me that and I never had the need to tell her that he tells me every single day!

So yes, it's annoying that she sent him that song. You can ask him how he feels about it but I don't think you have anything to worry about."
7658,2020-11-07 02:20:07,jpi6dt,If he feels this way about her then why is he still remaining friends with her and hanging out with her and her boyfriend ?

7724,2020-11-03 20:34:35,jnf9pg,what artists who would chart like that are being held hostage by their label?
7725,2020-11-04 01:55:39,jnf9pg,it's just radio bro and i think ur looking at the current spotify chart. last week drake was higher. it's not fishy it's just how labels push shit
7726,2020-11-04 15:36:23,jnf9pg,"everyone hated on views too but could probably name a similar number of tracks from it they dug

drake albums have been way too long and it doesn’t seem like it’s going to change. 40 was talking about how he has to cater to all styles"
7727,2020-11-03 20:50:53,jnf9pg,"idk, we will never know what songs that might have gone hot haven't been allowed to be released yet."
7728,2020-11-04 02:34:43,jnf9pg,Both Pop Smoke songs have been doing better than LNCL for over a month. That’s exactly my point that radio is carrying his chart entries. If a song at 29 is outperforming a song at number 4 then it shows how easy top 10’s can be bought.
7729,2020-11-03 21:18:34,jnf9pg,"there are artists that chart consistently, which of them are being held hostage?"
7730,2020-11-04 02:54:50,jnf9pg,yea you're right but it's the way it's always been its not fishy. billboard charts doesn't mean anything these days with all the bundles and shit
7731,2020-11-03 21:29:56,jnf9pg,"I don't know why you are so aggressively trying to pin me down on this lol, I don't know what projects are being put on hold and what aren't because of the lack of touring so there's no way for me to tell you, and there's no way to know what songs that may have popped off from artists who aren't Kendrick/Drake/Cole/Travis. Are you trying to dispute that labels are holding up projects or what, what's your angle here my man?"
7732,2020-11-03 22:05:50,jnf9pg,He's just asking you a simple question? You claim big artists are being held hostage... But can't name a single artist?
7733,2020-11-03 23:09:21,jnf9pg,">can these labels stop holding the artists hostage so we can get some actually good music? This chart is trash

If I thought that labels were holding artists hostage and the chart would be better if they weren't, I would be able to come up with a bunch of examples!

can you name any artists with charting potential with has maybe charted once or twice that is being held back?

i didn't wanna do this but do u mean soulo and just not wanna get clowned for thinking he would chart?"
7734,2020-11-03 22:16:10,jnf9pg,"I didn't claim big artists are being held hostage, I said artists. Anybody can chart in the streaming age, not just big names."
7735,2020-11-03 23:36:37,jnf9pg,"lmaoo no I don't think Ab Soul would chart

Like I said I can't name artists because we don't know who is being held back by labels, who is choosing to not drop out of self interest, who just doesn't have a project ready etc."
7736,2020-11-03 22:29:50,jnf9pg,"> can these labels stop holding the artists hostage so we can get some actually good music? This chart is trash

Saying ""This chart"" implies that the artist has to be relatively big enough to make it onto the charts. 

> Anybody can chart in the streaming age, not just big names.

Not really, who was the last 'unknown' to have a #1? Lil Nas X? That was a 1/billion chance of happening. Established names are the ones hitting the top of the chart and those 'anybody's' aren't being held back by a label."
7737,2020-11-03 23:09:53,jnf9pg,okay who are you referring to then?
7738,2020-11-03 23:42:54,jnf9pg,"so your just making shit up?

if this was an issue i would think i'd be able to come up w at least a couple names"
7739,2020-11-03 22:32:54,jnf9pg,"You can interpret how you'd like, that's not what I said though.

Labels aren't letting projects drop without touring being an option, not even disputable at this point."
7740,2020-11-03 23:10:13,jnf9pg,">Labels aren't letting projects drop without touring being an option, not even disputable at this point.

for example?

this isn't hard man"
7741,2020-11-03 23:34:44,jnf9pg,for example the extreme lack of projects dropped this year? It isn't hard to put 2 and 2 together
7742,2020-11-03 23:44:23,jnf9pg,"i have 9k songs from 2019 and 14k songs from 2020 idk what you're talking abt

you're also ignoring that artists have the same motive to not drop that labels would. ***Artists*** make most their money off touring, not album sales, not labels. I get the ""we don't know"" schtick but you should be able to come up with a couple anecdotes."
7743,2020-11-04 03:21:15,jnf9pg,"you got really unlucky here my man. Usually people can post stupid shit without being called out on it, but that wasn't the case here."
7744,2020-11-03 16:44:16,jndgxg,"So first is this like a paying job or are you asking for people to write for you for free?

Also Timberlake, Weeknd, and Sam Smith are far apart genre-wise so this is too vague. You should find specific songs that are all in the same ball park as a start. 

What do we get if we work with you? Why would someone give you their time and skill. What is in it for them?

Also can you write songs? Have you written songs before? Like very little background or detail in this whole process makes it harder to find people that want to build something with you"
7745,2020-11-03 21:52:11,jndgxg,I am willing to help. I play guitar and a bit of drums. I have experience writing songs and I also want to create some music that has the sound you want to go with. Send me a DM
7746,2020-11-03 17:07:37,jndgxg,"sorry for briefly expressing my desire

1.I am looking for people to create a musical team. In the future, each participant will receive a percentage of sales.

2. i  want to make rnb/pop/dance pop/ neo soul. I think that these performers are united by the theme of love, some kind of depression.

3.I am more looking for people who are ready to work with me for the sake of an idea and soul, and not for money.

4.I myself am a professional pianist performer. I have no talent to write songs, but I can perform."
7747,2020-11-03 17:37:24,jndgxg,I'm no saying this won't work but I think you need to give value to get value. Say that you play piano and are willing to play piano on other people's songs if they help you with songwriting. Like you can't pay with money but with a service

Out of curiosity what are your thoughts on Aiyuk vs Beasely- if you could only play one."
7770,2020-11-04 15:42:01,jnd187,Aiyuk looks like a true #1 and is getting targeted alot.. and facing the sorry Packers. My only question is if Mullens will be competent and feed him
7771,2020-11-04 16:08:40,jnd187,Mullens did look pretty good and targeted Aiyuk several times. So fingers crossed..
7772,2020-11-04 17:39:10,jnd187,"Also, with their RBs all on IR, definitely look for some jet sweep opportunities for Aiyuk. He'll get his i bet."

7787,2020-11-02 22:56:05,jmwiqs,"When I was working on my offseason plan, I decided that it would not be worth trading from our prospect systems. So this in a way, is a window to that route. It's really cool to see your arguments, and I enjoyed this read.

Other than that, we agree on Josh Bell and Stephen Brault. We also agree that Wolters/Diaz won't cut it. I didn't include Daniel Norris in mine, but we both agree that a lefty reliever is very much needed. 

So what I take away from all of this, in both just reading your post and comparing it to mind, is that the Rockies are in quite an interesting situation. The needs are obvious, every need you outlined is accurate. The interesting part is how we approach fixing those needs. And your offseason plan is creative, and a plan I can get behind. Good job."
7788,2020-11-03 04:37:36,jmwiqs,"Seriously great post

The only reason we won't resign diaz is because we're going to make sure Butera gets all the moneys"
7789,2020-11-03 13:36:14,jmwiqs,"This is very well thought out and written, and I’m willing to bet money that Bridich does absolutely none of it"
7790,2020-11-03 13:42:23,jmwiqs,"Like Skraxx, this is absolutely ridiculous in the best way.  


The numbers are nice. Doing some research of my own the contracts were hard to understand and keep track of. Appreciate that. 

With that said, I dislike the Norris trade. From an eye test, he just doesn't have it. Currently I live in Michigan, so I watch a lot of Tigers games. Was excited when Detroit got him, but it hasn't panned out and I dont know if our coaching can get him over the hump. 

Agree with the Castro idea and the FA class of Veteran arms"
7791,2020-11-03 17:24:08,jmwiqs,"I like these thought process.  It takes a lot of work! It's interesting that you two had similar moves especially targeting Josh Bell.

I also think it's interesting that we seem to be coalescing on the areas, the Rockies need/should/but-really-probably-won't address this off season.  If I think I got the list:

1. an everyday catcher
2. 1B preferable a power bat but it has to be a major league bat
3. SP depth (you can never have enough starting pitching)
4. Bullpen depth (as every team needs), At least one LH'er
5. An OF.  A corner OF Power bat would be nice but not exactly a ""must"", but a CF that can defend Coors Field center field is needed hopefully one with a bat that can stay in the line-up

I think I'd put more players on the trade block than most.  I'm not married to McMahon, Tapia, Gray.

If Story doesn't extend, of if he says he will try out Free Agency, then all of this could be thrown out, as I trade his last year for prospects.  And if I'm trading him, I'm going full Marlins sell off and trading anything that's not nailed down, including Arenado and Blackmon."
7792,2020-11-02 23:18:56,jmwiqs,"Glad you took the time to check this out. 

Trading from the system is definitely not something I want to do since the depth is already thin but I'd rather have RyMac than Schunk and Olivarez, although he's a smart trade chip.

Hopefully, we can see something along the lines of what we came up with come to fruition as it's apparent this team needs legitimate reinforcement badly without making sweeping changes to the roster and without investing money that isn't available. It's definitely frustrating to watch the handling of this roster when people like you and me, among others, could get a good crack at making this team better.

Cheers to you and let's hope this off-season isn't as unproductive as we expect it to be."
7793,2020-11-03 14:41:08,jmwiqs,I appreciate the kind words. Also couldn't agree more that nothing of the sort happens this winter.
7794,2020-11-03 14:43:32,jmwiqs,"Thanks for the dissent on the Norris idea. I've only watched Norris pitch a handful of times so that's a legit opinion I didn't have to weigh. If he can come cheap I still wouldn't be opposed since it's going to be hard to otherwise get a lefty, but I'm glad you brought this up so I can dig a little deeper into Norris."
7795,2020-11-03 18:11:20,jmwiqs,"Glad you read and enjoyed! 

I'm definitely with you on having a lot of MLB guys available like Gray, McMahon, Tapia, and even Dahl but my biggest concern with the roster is how it's top heavy and devoid of consistent contributions from the bottom quarter/third of the roster, so my goal was to hang onto those guys if possible.

If Story even gets to test the market, he's 90% gone. He'd likely get more money from big market teams and they'd have legitimate WS chances. Only problem is Monfort is too prideful and concerned about profit to commit to an actual rebuild although that would be the best track for success longterm."
7796,2020-11-03 18:21:28,jmwiqs,"Story is under his last controllable year in 2021.  After next season he's a Free Agent.  So the Rockies need to find out what his intentions are, THIS off season.  The Rockies can't FORCE him to stay, even if they offer him what they think is a market level type extension.  He can say, ""no, I'll see what my full worth is on the open market"".  

I think Story is going to be a Free Agent.  So I trade his last year (2021) for prospects.  The Rockies aren't winning anything or going to the playoffs next year WITH Story, so might as well turn him into something. 

And if Story is gone, why keep Arenado? He's only got one more year till his opt-out."

7807,2020-11-03 02:16:57,jmw2n1,"No I don’t think so, If so then we screwed"
7808,2020-11-02 16:15:58,jmq5fy,I think the single-engine alliance that is in the works will streamline this so there are more landing spots overall for Chevy development drivers.  Also added pressure is not a bad thing... get results or get out.  Beyond Chase Elliott not sure anyone really stands-out at the moment in the Chevy camp.
7809,2020-11-02 16:06:45,jmq5fy,"Like with the Erik Jones deal, these new young cuppers have a small window of time to make waves or they’ll get replaced. I could see Bryon being on hot seat in a year or two if performance doesn’t pick up. Bowman could drop off. Chastain will have a short leash I predict - I just don’t see that he has superstar personality/potential from a marketing perspective. The current JTG drivers can be booted any second. In short, there are options!"
7810,2020-11-02 16:21:16,jmq5fy,I don't think it's a bad thing to be a xfinity lifer. I think that's what the series needs right now. Most of the competitive drivers are up and comers and will be gone in a few years. If Matt D doesn't find a cup ride next year I would like to see him run a good xfinity car for multiple years. Same goes for Ty Dillion if he doesn't find a good cup ride this year. Jump into a RCR xfinity car and make a career out of it.
7811,2020-11-02 16:22:25,jmq5fy,"Keep an eye on some of the drivers who could retire in the next few years too, kurt busch, truex, hamlin, harvick, newman, etc. and some of the underperforming drivers like stenhouse could go back to dirt or preece to modifieds. that or get demoted to the xfinity series and find yearly success there"
7812,2020-11-02 16:14:05,jmq5fy,I could see Hayley taking the one. I feel like next season will be a break out season similar to Briscoes this year
7813,2020-11-02 16:47:02,jmq5fy,I am most interested about what Chevy will do with Brett Moffitt... my guess is he drives Kaulig’s 10 full time next year
7814,2020-11-02 18:09:43,jmq5fy,"surprised nobody's mentioned Sheldon Creed

i have no further input other than this, but he's a pretty good prospect that seems to have been overlooked"
7815,2020-11-02 16:09:18,jmq5fy,"Not every xfinity driver makes it to cup, some of these guys could bust out. I think the 37, the spire cars and maybe the 24 in a few years will have some of these guys in it. Also Kurt will retire soon so the 1 will be open. Ross might bust out and he could be gone in 2 years so the 42 could be back open."
7816,2020-11-02 16:38:45,jmq5fy,"They'll keep making ""real people"" commercials."
7817,2020-11-02 16:39:49,jmq5fy,"Gordon is high high high on David Gravel too so he is in the pipeline big time!  I think we will see another big Chevy team eventually come up.  To be fair, at HMS, Chase is locked in for life probably but I am not sure when and if they will give up on Byron, Bowman and Larson.  2021-2022 are likely lean economic years, even these owners are going to be losing money bigger than normal, Larson has no sponsors at all right now, and who knows if some of these others businesses can sustain the losses they may see and continue on.  That's my long winded way of saying, you never know what can happen."
7818,2020-11-02 16:06:42,jmq5fy,"Haley and Gragson are nowhere near the talent level of the 4 currently at Hendrick

Mayer and Zane could be, but that's years away

Depends on what RCR, RPM, and CGR decide to do with their cars. By the time Zane and Mayer are ready, it'll be apparent that Chastain is not a cup level driver and he could very easily be replaced as well."
7819,2020-11-02 16:55:04,jmq5fy,"Another thing to note is that Chevy’s 2nd and 3rd biggest team have room to grow. If sponsorship appears, RCR or CGR could expand to 3 or 4 cars. Not to mention the potential Kaulig Cup team, RPM going back to 2 cars, Spire allegedly becoming a respectable team, and (least likely in my opinion, but still a possibility I suppose) a JRM cup team. There’s options for some decent Chevy rides to open up in the near future with the Next Gen car.

Edit - Securing charters for these teams might be the most difficult part now that I think about it."
7820,2020-11-02 16:59:52,jmq5fy,"I feel like Hendrick might wind up with a legit satellite team soon. They’re the only team without a real one, and I could kinda see the JTG cars becoming like a 23XI or a Wood Bro’s to Hendricks. I have literally nothing to base this on, just something I’ve been thinking about"
7821,2020-11-02 16:31:30,jmq5fy,"In 2022 you should figure 4 Hendrick cars, 2 Childress cars, 1 JTG Daughtery car, 2 CGR cars, 2 Spire cars, 1 Trackhouse car, and 1 RPM car. I think with the combined engine programs, new car, and Chevy R&D center, we could see 13 good Chevy entries and maybe some new teams. I think they will have plenty of seats for guys. Toyota has 5."
7822,2020-11-02 16:38:19,jmq5fy,"I think there's a chance either Gragson or Haley go to the 1 in 2022 if Kurt retires after next year, which he said was 50-50. Hendrick might just keep Byron for the long term as long as Liberty University keeps backing him up. Ally will also have a say as to who drives the 48 in the long term by the time Sam is ready for Cup."
7823,2020-11-02 18:31:37,jmq5fy,"Really hard to say what'll happen 3-4 years from now. Way too many variables.

In 22, let's say, I doubt any of the HMS seats are open. I DO think Kurt might retire and open up a ride at CGR though. That seat is less lucrative, but competitive enough for the most promising bowtie wearer in the NXS next year to make a name for themselves.

Also, there's a decent chance that JTG might have a seat open too. We don't even properly know who's in the 37 next year as of yet, though it's probably Preece. I think that says a lot about the availability of that seat for young drivers in the near future.

More importantly I don't think there will be many lucrative chances at Toyota or Ford either. The best chance for a good opening is at Roush; Newman has to be close to hanging it up. But something tells me it might be a vet in that car."
7824,2020-11-02 16:05:11,jmq5fy,Aren’t they also building a massive facility dedicated to racing development near the teams?
7825,2020-11-02 16:55:42,jmq5fy,"Same thing that happened with Brad K a few years back. Hendrick didn't have a ride for him so Roger Penske gave him one. None of this is new, if they have the combination of talent and money (mostly the money) they'll find a ride. With new teams being formed they will be looking for talent. If spire for example gets more hendrick support in the coming years like is rumored they can easily become a home for some of those drivers."
7826,2020-11-02 17:21:11,jmq5fy,"Zane Smith will have a couple years with JRM, and if Byron doesn't improve, he will replace him"
7827,2020-11-02 20:46:01,jmq5fy,"Honestly, I think you have to look at some of the chevy drivers and honestly say they'll be out of a seat in 2 years.  Look at Jones with as much as Toyota had invested in him, they weren't getting results quick enough and had to make a decision.  You just don't have the luxury of sitting around for 5-7 years learning a cup ride anymore.  I think Byron is a very talented young driver, but if he doesn't put together some deep points championship runs he could feel a lot of heat in the #24 car with those guys in Xfinity."
7828,2020-11-02 21:08:21,jmq5fy,Eat them
7829,2020-11-02 21:12:48,jmq5fy,"Unfortunately, I don't think Haley is on deck to be hired by a competitive Chevrolet team in Cup, or at least not one in the HMS/RCR/JTG cool kids' technical alliance, despite a huge amount of talent and some pretty amazing success at all levels of the NASCAR ladder. Hoping  either that Kaulig will bring him with them when they move upwards or that he'll catch someone else's eye. 

&#x200B;

This could all change if he wins the Xfinity title, though."
7830,2020-11-02 16:05:43,jmq5fy,"1) These things tend to work themselves out. A lot can happen in the 3-5 years before Mayer is ready for Cup.

2) If I'm head of GM.. I'm not totally concerned if Haley or Gragson move on. It's not like you're losing a Bell or Briscoe level prospect."
7831,2020-11-02 18:49:32,jmq5fy,RWR
7832,2020-11-02 21:35:15,jmq5fy,The not enough seats dilemma is similar to the Mercedes F1 team and junior program. The get results now or get out dilemma is similar to Red Bull's F1 team and ladder system.
7833,2020-11-02 22:48:24,jmq5fy,"I think you’ll have some stuff happen like you did with Erik Jones, but I also think some are just gonna have to be in a lower tier car or stay in the lower series. Hendrick is very loyal to his drivers. Really all three of the top Chevy teams are very loyal."
7834,2020-11-02 23:07:04,jmq5fy,If Byron does not win a (points paying race) next year he will be replaced by Gragson in 2022. Bowman finally year at Hendrick will be 2022 because more than likely Sam Mayer will end up in the 48 if he does great at JRM.
7835,2020-11-03 02:16:53,jmq5fy,"Dump Byron, hes a good hot laper, mediocre racer"
7836,2020-11-03 02:51:57,jmq5fy,"The landscape could change dramatically in 2022 as well with the new car and the alleged improvements in affordability. You could certainly see RCR and CGR close the gap to Hendrick, and an explosion of new, competitive teams could happen."
7837,2020-11-02 16:05:49,jmq5fy,Chevrolet is going to regret the decision not to court and sign Chase Briscoe to one of their teams before SHR signed him.
7838,2020-11-02 16:04:01,jmq5fy,There are several other Chevrolet teams.
7839,2020-11-02 16:03:32,jmq5fy,Well they don’t see to care about car count per org any more so they could just put 5-8 cars in a race now. Just need the sponsorship
7840,2020-11-02 18:23:07,jmq5fy,"The 99 (third RCR car) - Suarez seat will be hot if he performs like he did this year 

The 37 - Preece will be given the boot in 5 seconds for a Gragson, even Sam Mayer

The 47 - see the 37. Ricky brings virtually nothing, 1-2 races a year with NOS. His time is almost up 

The 1 - you don’t think Kurt will be retired after 3/4 more years?? Look at his announcing right now and see: Clint"
7841,2020-11-02 16:47:24,jmq5fy,Fuck Sam Mayer

7843,2020-11-02 16:18:40,jmq5fy,"Kurt has been good. He's certainly overperformed CGR imo. 

Bowman took a step forward this year.

Those are the only ones imo."
7844,2020-11-02 16:18:40,jmq5fy,"Bowman? Once Chevy can more consistently give more that one driver the car to run, he's always going to be a top 5-10 driver. Larson will fly away in those Hendrick cars in the next few years, anybody denying that hasn't been paying attention, Byron is still young but is probably the only possibility of anyone leaving Hendrick anytime soon."
7845,2020-11-02 19:55:01,jmq5fy,"Kyle Larson would like to have a word with you.

Seriously?"
7846,2020-11-02 16:27:50,jmq5fy,I think Byron will have a breakout year next year with Rudy on the box but at the same time i feel like as long as he continues making the playoffs his seat wont get that warm. He brings sponsorship and has a good relationship with Rick Hendrick and Jeff Gordon. I also think that Rick and Jeff both know what real talent he has and are willing to be very patient with him given the fact that next year he’ll be in his 4th cup year and will only be 23 which is pretty insane to think about.
7847,2020-11-02 16:41:04,jmq5fy,I'm curious why you think Bowman could drop off? He's shown steady improvement each season with HMS
7848,2020-11-02 16:11:42,jmq5fy,"Bowman's just now picking up momentum, no reason to believe he won't just get better. But agreed on Chastain, both CGR could be open in a few years."
7849,2020-11-02 19:58:37,jmq5fy,"I strongly disagree on Chastain.  All he needs is wins/ top fives consistently in Cup to become a star.  Chastain is agressive on track, stands his ground off track, has this unique melon man persona background with a humble/blue collar/dry humor.  Chastain is likeable, but will do what's necessary on the track.  I think he and Kurt will really click as teammates."
7850,2020-11-03 10:55:23,jmq5fy,Deep pockets make those small windows way bigger.
7851,2020-11-02 16:48:28,jmq5fy,"Bryon has got to be on the hot seat next year, dude couldn’t get it done with one of the best CC's in NASCAR history, and they went out and got him a new guy to work with that can cater to him better.

If he doesn’t get it done next year I think he'll be looking for a ride"
7852,2020-11-02 18:09:54,jmq5fy,"Same. Its a consistent ride without the insane pressure to perform at the top level. Elliot Sadler was more than comfortable as a lifer there, just like Hornaday was in the trucks."
7853,2020-11-02 19:38:19,jmq5fy,There isn't. And it would make that series stronger in the long run. It is enjoyable watching a young up and comer needing to battle it out again some old veterans and keep a continual connect for fans in that series.
7854,2020-11-02 16:24:27,jmq5fy,"JGR possibly being Gragson, Kyle Busch,  Bell, and...Brandon Jones? would be interesting."
7855,2020-11-02 19:53:03,jmq5fy,"I really hope he ends up there, he's really grown on me and I'd love to see him replace Kurt, if he does retire next year."
7856,2020-11-02 16:56:26,jmq5fy,I’ve been pondering this as well... guy should be in XFinity
7857,2020-11-02 16:47:38,jmq5fy,Isn't that supposedly Allmendingers ride?
7858,2020-11-03 15:09:36,jmq5fy,"Unless Mayer gets poached, I think he's a good candidate for CGR. Creed and Ganassi both have interests in various other racing series. Also fits the profile of what I expect from a CGR driver. Aggressive, getting the most out of their cars, strong on restarts and short runs."
7859,2020-11-02 16:13:33,jmq5fy,"Unless spire improves significantly, i'm not counting them. If a car's not semi competitive(RPM minimum I'd say) what's the point?"
7860,2020-11-02 16:41:20,jmq5fy,"Yeah big time, even some of these guys who look really good, they may never get their shot.  And how many good Busch drivers have we seen suck it up and take a shitbox ride just to get to Cup and flop out?  Harrison Burton, Brandon Jones, etc, they are one season at Rick Ware or Spire from becoming Scott Wimmer or Scott Riggs."
7861,2020-11-02 16:42:47,jmq5fy,Gragson I agree but Haley might be a star in the making.
7862,2020-11-02 16:15:37,jmq5fy,"Yeah Chastain i feel will be an Xfinity lifer at some point. Gragson needs to be in cup just for his controversialness combined with pretty competitiveness, Chevy doesn't have much personality in Cup right now."
7863,2020-11-02 17:00:49,jmq5fy,"Chevy should improve in general with the engine alliance, so we'll see."
7864,2020-11-02 17:28:20,jmq5fy,Hendrick already supplies the engines and pit crews for JTG I believe.
7865,2020-11-02 16:33:10,jmq5fy,You reckon either Burton will make it up? Harrison looking more like he will than he used to but idk.
7866,2020-11-02 18:44:27,jmq5fy,"Yep, this is the real issue for Toyota's system. If Chevy has a hot up and comer, they can shuffle the deck chairs easily and make room at JTG or somewhere similar.

If Toyota has a hot up and comer, Kyle, MTG and Denny are firmly entrenched. That's 3/4 of your power seats locked up. At that point if you want say Harrison Burton, you need to drop Bell which isn't going to happen, at least not for 2 years. Bubba is important for the 23 so he's likely locked in to your B seat.

Ford doesn't even need a Xfinity system outside of a few choice guys since they know they can pick off guys who fall off the Chevy and Toyota wagons. 

Toyota really need a larger B team to stash and develop their young guys. MWR and Red Bull flaming out really hurts them. Not to mention the JGR alliance teams that bailed like FRR and LFR. Suarez and Jones are both headed to Chevy aftering being TRD standouts. Maybe the new 23 team can expand in the future to create more room."
7867,2020-11-02 16:39:21,jmq5fy,I honestly wish Reddick would get the 24 at some point. And there's no reason Bowman won't be around as long as Chase.
7868,2020-11-02 17:21:53,jmq5fy,"That'd be great, though i still want Reddick in a Hendrick car but one can dream"
7869,2020-11-03 11:17:43,jmq5fy,Unless you got the money
7870,2020-11-02 21:09:17,jmq5fy,Valid point that I thinkwe should all consider
7871,2020-11-02 21:13:44,jmq5fy,Kaulig is definitely his best chance of moving up.
7872,2020-11-02 17:05:50,jmq5fy,"I wouldn’t be surprised if Gragson or Haley have big seasons next year. But I agree, right now, Mayer looks like the best prospect Chevy has."
7873,2020-11-02 22:14:07,jmq5fy,ironic considering bottas is washed and is not doing enough to challenge his teammate.
7874,2020-11-03 01:07:55,jmq5fy,"Byron already won a race this year. He’s been on fire with up to the front racing. (And there has been times where he wasn’t so lucky, but he definitely has gotten better since he got his hands behind the wheels of the 24. Hendrick is a patient team owner and knows when a driver is doing good or not."
7875,2020-11-03 02:17:18,jmq5fy,He's still only 22 thi
7876,2020-11-03 02:53:09,jmq5fy,They'll close the gap anyways with the new engine alliance
7877,2020-11-02 16:48:44,jmq5fy,How do you know they  didn't try?
7878,2020-11-02 22:22:01,jmq5fy,hard to do when he's already been driving for SHR in xfinity. there will be what ifs but definitely no regrets.
7879,2020-11-02 16:05:06,jmq5fy,">	Well they don’t see to care about car count per org any more so they could just put 5-8 cars in a race now.

?"
7880,2020-11-02 18:26:02,jmq5fy,"Um well i mentioned the 1 in my post, what do you mean how Suarez did this year? He ran well enough in bad equipment. I'll give Preece another year before making a decision on him(his luck has been atrocious) and i still think Ricky is one of the most talented drivers in the field, even if he doesn't always show it"
7881,2020-11-02 20:47:11,jmq5fy,suarez will be leaps and bounds better in RCR equipment than gaunt bros.
7882,2020-11-02 16:48:14,jmq5fy,What'd he do to you?
7883,2020-11-03 11:23:08,jmq5fy,Ouch
7884,2020-11-02 16:41:07,jmq5fy,Expanding on that is Action Express Racing is interested in NASCAR in '22 with the spec chassis. Then there is the constant rumor of a 4th manufacturer.
7885,2020-11-02 16:05:42,jmq5fy,RCR has both Dillon brothers and Reddick. Ganassi has Chastain. Neither of these teams are running well enough or will be soon to add teams. Heck Ty Dillon is out of a ride.
7886,2020-11-02 16:06:54,jmq5fy,And JTG Daugherty who can add 2.
7887,2020-11-02 22:23:40,jmq5fy,you forgot the variable called money
7888,2020-11-02 16:06:52,jmq5fy,Spending other people's money i see. None of those teams are competitive enough to warrant spending the money adding cars. Ty Dillon is out of a ride ffs.
7889,2020-11-02 16:21:41,jmq5fy,"I didn't even think about the fact that once Kurt retires, Larson will be the overall vet at Chevy as a whole. Him and Bowman i guess"
7890,2020-11-02 17:47:13,jmq5fy,Byron will still be the second-youngest full time driver next year. Ain’t that amazing?
7891,2020-11-03 00:27:04,jmq5fy,I'm sure he has a word...
7892,2020-11-02 16:43:14,jmq5fy,"Byron has money and the similarity in resemblance he has with Ricky Hendrick means there’s no way he’s going to go as long as Rick Hendrick is involved.

It feels like Byron is racing vicariously as Ricky in Rick Hendrick’s Point of View. And I can’t blame him for that."
7893,2020-11-02 17:59:39,jmq5fy,He hasn’t exactly been popular with the sponsors. Hopefully he and Ally are together for a long time.
7894,2020-11-02 17:27:37,jmq5fy,Yeh Bowman has done enough to prove he’s capable. I don’t think he’s going anywhere.
7895,2020-11-02 22:56:19,jmq5fy,"> I strongly disagree on Chastain. All he needs is wins/ top fives consistently in Cup to become a star.

He can't even win in the 'weakened' Xfinity field though :/ 

I like him, but honestly, I'm baffled he got the 42."
7896,2020-11-02 18:22:29,jmq5fy,Chad kansus is a shell of his former self
7897,2020-11-02 19:53:43,jmq5fy,And no pay
7898,2020-11-02 16:40:14,jmq5fy,You forgot Burton
7899,2020-11-02 16:17:33,jmq5fy,"Field Filler to borderline elite is a rout to cup success, ie bowman. But yeah it’s not a sexy ride. But it might be ok for a lower tier prospect like Haley."
7900,2020-11-02 16:49:09,jmq5fy,"That a Toyota issue, they get 80% of their talent poached. There are only 15 or so top tier rides. Not every prospect can get one of those right away."
7901,2020-11-02 16:48:23,jmq5fy,"He might be the key to legitimizing Spire’s race operations. They bought the LFR assets, they now can move away from the premium partnership and with Gen7 they stand a chance of improving their operation from back marker to midpacker. Especially if they can get in on the Chevy engine program.
 
He’s family to Todd Braun, who’s tight with the Spire group."
7902,2020-11-02 17:28:43,jmq5fy,I have to see more from Haley on non-restrictors. I’m just not convinced. Next season is a big one for his career.
7903,2020-11-02 16:36:10,jmq5fy,"Even though chevy doesn't have personality, they have talent locked up with sponsors. Elliott probably has 100 companies looking to sponsor waiting for an opening just because he's elliott. Bowman now has ally locked in with him. Plus they're performing and have no reason to be replaced anyways"
7904,2020-11-03 15:12:03,jmq5fy,Yeah but now RCR and HMS have agreed to work together on the new 2022 engine.
7905,2020-11-02 16:34:54,jmq5fy,"Harrison is in a much, much better spot than Jeb. Having Dex as a sponsor and 4 wins is crucial. If Toyota wants to have another team in 2022 thats where he is going. I think Next Gen is gonna really open up alot of possibilities"
7906,2020-11-03 15:13:16,jmq5fy,I agree with you. I just wonder how much longer MTJ and Denny will race.
7907,2020-11-02 17:23:11,jmq5fy,"I feel that, I still have dreams of Brad being with HMS, since I loved him at JR Motorsports, but he got screwed over, but it worked out"
7908,2020-11-03 11:18:57,jmq5fy,Zane Smith
7909,2020-11-02 19:56:29,jmq5fy,Howwww
7910,2020-11-03 00:26:13,jmq5fy,That's what mercedes wants tho. F1 teams/drivers care deeply about who's the #1 and the #2 drivers
7911,2020-11-02 18:11:50,jmq5fy,"hah exactly, especially since Chase's idol was Tony, I'm SURE Chase was holding out as long as he could for SHR. Tony already let him know earlier this season that Clint's ride was his whenever he hung up his boots, this year or next."
7912,2020-11-02 16:08:31,jmq5fy,JGR has 5 cars next year. Why can’t anyone else wiht the same “deal”
7913,2020-11-02 16:44:58,jmq5fy,[deleted]
7914,2020-11-02 23:10:42,jmq5fy,[deleted]
7915,2020-11-02 18:09:06,jmq5fy,Him and Chase. He's been racing long enough to be a vet now.
7916,2020-11-02 20:50:00,jmq5fy,Austin Dillon as well.
7917,2020-11-02 17:19:36,jmq5fy,"That is super weird, I never realized that"
7918,2020-11-02 17:50:02,jmq5fy,Wait who is younger? I feel dumb for asking but i cant think of who it is.
7919,2020-11-02 17:17:37,jmq5fy,"I 100% agree with the Ricky Hendrick thing. William got the coveted flagship 24, and he'll now be on his third crew chief in his fourth season (and got to help pick Rudy this time around instead of being assigned somebody with no input). I think Rick really has him under his wing and is going to be very patient with him to get rolling."
7920,2020-11-02 21:05:32,jmq5fy,"Nationwide pulled out of HMS over the course of 2018 and 2019 because Bowman wasn't Dale Jr, not because he's unmarketable or anything like that. It's the catch-22 of sponsorship: big companies don't want to fund drivers who aren't ubiquitous household names, but it's close to impossible for drivers to get to the top level of stock car racing- much less get sponsorships from corporations with a net worth in the range of nine figures and become a star- if they don't have existing sponsor promotions.

&#x200B;

I think Ally signing a new multiyear (?) deal to be the full-time or nearly full-time primary on Bowman's car next year in the middle of a pandemic, with the accompanying global economic situation being worse than it has been at any point over the last century, is a pretty great testament to both their loyalty to the team and Alex's potential to be a big financial draw."
7921,2020-11-02 23:01:20,jmq5fy,"He has been insanely consistent though and running up front, most top tens in the series"
7922,2020-11-02 19:34:08,jmq5fy,"My thought on that isn't on Chad losing a step as much as Chad not adapting to plan for 3 mini races due to the stage format. How many times did Jimmie come out of nowhere to win a race where he wasn't a factor? When you can't plan for 400 miles and instead have to plan for pre-planned 100 miles/100 miles/200 miles, your creativity gets stifled."
7923,2020-11-02 22:49:07,jmq5fy,Who?
7924,2020-11-02 20:53:56,jmq5fy,They make more than you or me will probably ever see. Not cup money but still a good living.
7925,2020-11-02 16:44:48,jmq5fy,Harrison? Jeb hasn't looked like the talent that'd move up to Cup but we'll see.
7926,2020-11-02 16:19:46,jmq5fy,"I can agree with that on Haley. Gragson i could see ending up at JGR somehow, with the way he drives."
7927,2020-11-02 17:16:34,jmq5fy,They didn't get LFR cars or equipment though.
7928,2020-11-02 22:15:56,jmq5fy,spire could really do something with the gen 7 car if they play their cards right
7929,2020-11-02 17:32:21,jmq5fy,"Yeah agreed.  It's amazing to me, he finished worst of the playoff drivers at Martinsville but he had good stages so he squeaked in.  With a presumed reduction in elite drivers in Xfinity, he should be expected to have some wins and not just plate wins next year.  Not sure who is taking over for Ross but he's gone and Briscoe is gone so Haley should expect to step up and grab some of those wins."
7930,2020-11-02 17:33:47,jmq5fy,"He's had a great year and many times he outran Ross in the same equipment. And now Ross is going cup racing for a major organization. Easy to forget Haley is still only 21, I think he is a star in the making and will really show it next year. I also don't think Kaulig is quite to the level of JR Motorsports, JGR, or Penske, yet just a small step below - that gap will probably close next year as they keep investing in the program."
7931,2020-11-02 16:36:52,jmq5fy,"I mean agreed on Bowman, but aren't the sponsors tied to the car not him?"
7932,2020-11-02 16:39:32,jmq5fy,Byron also has Liberty and several others
7933,2020-11-02 16:36:06,jmq5fy,Harrison and Brandon Jones i think will move up in 2022
7934,2020-11-02 17:24:32,jmq5fy,"It could still happen in 2022 but probably not, but like i said before one can dream"
7935,2020-11-03 00:44:25,jmq5fy,"yeah and thats hurting the sport. no competition equals snoozefest of a championship. Way more interesting to see hamilton and verstappen go at in mercedes, then to see lewis playing F1 on easy mode."
7936,2020-11-02 16:18:01,jmq5fy,"JGR has the 11, 18, 19, and 20.  Is there some secret fifth JGR car?"
7937,2020-11-02 16:49:22,jmq5fy,I mean it’s no different than LFR so your complaint seems a bit silly.
7938,2020-11-02 16:48:51,jmq5fy,Yeah that's what happens when i'm responding to different people's comments.
7939,2020-11-03 00:45:08,jmq5fy,"it takes quite a bit of cash to run a four car team. that's why penske, despite being a billionare, is only running three."
7940,2020-11-02 20:42:53,jmq5fy,"hhaa, yeah, this is Chase's 5th year of Cup series competition.  Wild because hes only 24.  Kinda like Kyle Busch being in his 16th full year of competition and only being 35."
7941,2020-11-02 18:08:02,jmq5fy,"Cole Custer, by just under 2 months"
7942,2020-11-02 19:49:09,jmq5fy,To be fair his third crew chief has less to do with him and more to do with the organization.
7943,2020-11-02 21:08:07,jmq5fy,"You're totally right about stages hurting the whole 48 team, so it's even funnier/weirder that Jimmie got his seventh title by winning the final Cup race before the implementation of stages- after leading a grand total of 3 laps."
7944,2020-11-05 11:26:11,jmq5fy,"What is the salary for an Xfinity driver? What about if they arent on the top couple of teams? I know that specific drivers make bank. Roughly 1 million. But what about the rest?

And what about the truck series?"
7945,2020-11-02 16:55:45,jmq5fy,Obviously talking about Harrison lmao
7946,2020-11-02 16:22:32,jmq5fy,"Yeah really lol, I think Mayer is the next big prospect right now but a lot can change. He is still 4-5 years out. The 24 very well could be open for him, and heck same with the 5."
7947,2020-11-02 17:18:50,jmq5fy,"They won’t need the chassis (which were leased from JGR). They just needed a space - which they got from LFR. Since they’re a marketing firm they hadn’t invested in a physical space and just relied on Premium to prep their cars. Now they can do that on their own if they want, or wait until Gen 7 to make that investment.
 
But buying a race shop is a sign that they might try to be more like JTG than Rick Ware."
7948,2020-11-02 16:39:17,jmq5fy,"The sponsor originally was tied with the car, but they clearly wanted Bowman to be the guy in it"
7949,2020-11-02 16:38:37,jmq5fy,"Yeah but hendrick can't just put whoever they want in, ally has to agree"
7950,2020-11-02 16:19:30,jmq5fy,He seems grumpy about 23XI
7951,2020-11-02 16:30:55,jmq5fy,Them cheatin’ yoders are at it again...
7952,2020-11-02 16:58:39,jmq5fy,No difference the when Stewart-Haas was a Chevy team and bought all their stuff from Hendrick Motorsports.
7953,2020-11-02 16:58:40,jmq5fy,Does a current JGR driver own part of LFR? It’s very different.
7954,2020-11-03 01:12:42,jmq5fy,[deleted]
7955,2020-11-05 14:04:09,jmq5fy,I don’t know exactly. But I’m sure drivers on a top team like JRM make a pretty high salary.
7956,2020-11-02 16:58:31,jmq5fy,I figured but he's in the Toyota camp right now so I didn't mention him.
7957,2020-11-02 16:25:09,jmq5fy,"I hope the 5 isn't lol but anything can happen. Idc what happens to the 24, but the other 3 i hope are around a long time."
7958,2020-11-03 11:04:43,jmq5fy,Or Zane Smith
7959,2020-11-02 16:39:47,jmq5fy,Over Larson lmao
7960,2020-11-02 17:00:16,jmq5fy,Right. That’s kind of my point. If they’re not getting free shit it’s no different
7961,2020-11-02 16:59:45,jmq5fy,"I mean, there’s no evidence it will be any different"
7962,2020-11-03 01:19:47,jmq5fy,im sorry to break it to you but at the state the sports in talent no longer means sponsorship.
7963,2020-11-02 17:32:19,jmq5fy,You didn’t factor in the Toyota driver when predicting Toyota’s flagship team’s lineup?
7964,2020-11-02 16:27:33,jmq5fy,"I am in the same boat, I want to see the 5 back in contention. Larson is a huge wildcard right now because we don’t know how it’s going to work out but I hope he kills it. 

Byron is meh and he is the most expendable HMS driver. If a top tier Chevy prospect needs a cup ride, as of now the 24 is probably their best bet."
7965,2020-11-03 01:38:25,jmq5fy,[deleted]
7966,2020-11-02 17:33:49,jmq5fy,"Oof i'm dumb. I forgot about this portion of comments. Burton over Jones then. I had hoped both Burtons would be good enough for Cup so we still have a family competition, but that's not going to happen."

7968,2020-11-03 01:41:20,jmq5fy,how far is chevy willing to go to put a driver in a car. considering the financial spot the sports in i just dont see it happening.
7969,2020-11-02 20:55:57,jmq5fy,Why do you thing Gragson will return to Toyota/JGR? I highly doubt that happens.
7970,2020-11-02 16:35:48,jmq5fy,"Bowman is the real deal, I guess they didn’t like the Sumer slump with him because he was the RND car until the playoffs. 

Byron is super young, he could be elite or he could be mediocre. HMS is doing the right thing by giving him time. Fortunately their isn’t a once in a generation Chevy prospect in xfinity right now so he has a bit to figure it out."
7971,2020-11-02 21:00:05,jmq5fy,He just matches the driving style of JGR drivers a lot more than anybody that has been in a Chevy in awhile
7972,2020-11-02 16:37:51,jmq5fy,"True, Smith and Mayer still have two series to get through before they make it, by then Byron should be showing his true colors, whatever those are."
7973,2020-11-03 15:07:33,jmq5fy,I didnt think about him being the R&D car but it makes sense with his early win and good runs in the playoffs.
7974,2020-11-02 21:03:43,jmq5fy,Yeah I get that I guess. I just don't think Gragson left there on very good terms. He wanted to go to xfinity with JGR. But JGR didn't see him as a part of their future and wouldn't hire him full-time. That's why he's at JRM.
7975,2020-11-02 16:47:20,jmq5fy,"Yep, and if RCR continues to have a revitalization they will be in the Chevy prospect game as well. I could see them expanding after the next gen cars come out."

It was historical because Uzoh, a benchwarmer in the 2011-12 season, helped lead the Raptors to a victory that tied them with the Golden State Warriors for a 23-43 record. This meant that the Warriors would keep their draft pick if it were top 7, which they did. They used it to draft Harrison Barnes, who while not the star player the Ws needed to contend was nevertheless a good complementary piece, and was part of the 2015 championship team and was the linchpin of a trade to Dallas that opened up cap space for Kevin Durant in 2016."

8003,2020-12-15 17:58:04,kdlqv5,Would have required 10 steals in a game cause there no was no way he was getting 10 rebounds at his size/with the Jazz gameplan.
8004,2021-03-13 08:13:26,kdlqv5,"People are seriously ignorant of the past players. Especially the newer fans. Oscar, west, Havlicek, and a few other legends from the 60's that had the longevity played some of the same competition that bird and magic did. They were past their primes and still showed glimpses of their dominant selfs. 

Hell, Rick Barry (who was battling Wilt and Russ in the 60's) played in the same league as Larry Bird. How MJ, Larry, and Magic can be considered top 3 players by most fans while the previous players get laughed at and written off literally makes zero sense."

The song is called [Always Difficult Always Beautiful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Krav5eBax5E), which is a quote from the episode.

In terms of music videos, there's Tenny who released their 159cm mv around 2 years ago (I think?) which is about two girls who love eachother but their parents don't allow it so they run away, then there's One More Day by Sistar which is again about two girls who love eachother but one of them has an *TW!!*(abusive?) boyfriend and I think they end up killing him, and I'm your girl ? by Khan was not confirmed whether to be LGBT representative but everybody thinks so, and finally there's Heart Attack by Chuu which instead of being with a male actor, they used Yves (another member of Loona) which I think was very nice in terms of LGBT representation and they have picked up on that and said that they're happy that Orbits have understood it in that way... I'm not too certain about male representatives or male idols that are supportive.. as I'm not much of a bg stan haha

Also, I think it was a member of dreamcatcher but I'm not sure, when asked a question about dating she replied with 'i would date a gender' or something along those lines, and put an emphasis on gender

Some girl groups, when performing a cover of Boombayah, they change the 'Oppa!' shout to 'Unnie!' which I think is a cool little representation because I do that the whole time around my family but because they aren't K-pop fans, so they don't understand the difference between oppa and unnie haha"

Hweseung and Dongsung have expressed loving the characters of the Umbrella Academy and have gone out of their way to promote it on two separate occasions, the whole band has admitted to watching Bohemian Rhapsody from start to finish a ridiculous amount of times, Hweseung, upon being casted in a musical for the first time, took on a more homoerotic approach to his character even though the script and direction didn’t demand it, and Cha Hun went out of his way to purposefully create a gender neutral doll so all types of love could be represented by it even though the manga it was inspired by portrayed a heterosexual relationship.

In addition, and this could just be me missing aspects of Korean that don’t get transferred over to English translations, but like... most of the love songs that they have written, specifically by Seunghyub from the past couple years, don’t seem to have a gender. Like from Rooftop onwards, I haven’t seen any of their songs be like “Girl I love you” it’s always just “I love you”. That could be me reading too much into it tho lmao."

They're also usually good about directing re-directing heteronormative questions -- for example, if someone asks about girlfriends, they'll often rephrase as ""girlfriends or boyfriends"" when they're answering the question.

Their Line icons, BT21, are also semi-canonically genderqueer. They were originally meant to be male (and are still referred to with he/him pronouns on some official media) but Suga and Jimin insisted that they be considered neither male nor female, and the rest of BTS agreed.

First, there is a WILD irony from all the red states talking about ""broke liberal cities"" (Mitch McConnel's Kentucky is projected to get $48 Billion dollars more than they contributed this year) meanwhile they rely on those broke liberal cities so they get WAY more money than they can contribute. 

The United States is about lowest common denominator so I don't disagree with that aspect. Yes states do need help. But this is the whole welfare debate. If a state can't get by on a 120% return, or a 150%, but actually requires 213% to be a viable state, there may be some underlying issues that need addressed. But they won't be because accountability is completely removed. 

Under my plan that I mentioned, the amount that would go to feds would just stay with the feds. They wouldn't collect to then redistribute.

That money does get redistributed, bro.    There's 15 Military bases in Texas, and barely one in Oregon.

Your posit is that state level government is corruption-free?

My state and eight others don't even have income tax.   We're funded through property and sales tax.   So we get a completely free ride on Federal level stuff?

Defund the police was never any sitting politician's platform, it was a slogan that protesters on the far left were chanting. Somehow that became official democrat orthodoxy and Democrats had to defend the idea when it was never their platform in the first place. 

That shit doesn't happen to the right. Trump's literally trying to overturn an election with claims of rampant voter fraud that don't have a shred of evidence and a pile of lawsuits. It's treated as a minor talking point on the news and the effort's chances of success are discussed.

8178,2020-12-14 22:40:54,kd725d,I would be happy with every combination suggested here.
8179,2020-12-15 13:01:37,kd725d,"Honestly as stupid as it sounds, it'd be pretty cool to have a fellow Lebanese dude coaching the Lions."
8180,2020-12-15 02:22:45,kd725d,"Coaching is key to winning in the NFL. You can have a good to great GM but if the talent they bring in isn't maximized to its full potential then its wasted talent. 

I think the one thing that has held this team back during the Stafford era is a lack of a great  HC and good coordinators. Mayhew did a good job of bringing in  both young and veteran talent but too often, that talent seemed to hit a plateau as far as development. 

None of the coaches we've had incorporated a truly innovative scheme on either side of the ball and outside of Austin, none of our coordinators were ever really considered for HC positions. I also think that each coach tried too much to make the team theirs instead of maximizing what they had.

Schwartz overcommitted to the wide 9. Caldwell turned Stafford into a game manager. MP did the same with Stafford and tried to implant his limited man to man defensive scheme even though the existing talent was geared more to a zone scheme. 

Whoever comes in next will have an easier go of things because there isn't much to build around so I think they could basically do whatever they want and build a new."
8181,2020-12-15 02:39:50,kd725d,Interesting point maybe that's the plan with the ex Texans GM
8182,2020-12-14 23:17:00,kd725d,I thought martin Mayhew was the right hand man in frisco
8183,2020-12-15 03:26:25,kd725d,Adam Gase has ties to Detroit too and used to work for the Lions lololol
8184,2020-12-15 17:36:09,kd725d,"No man, it’s a real thing. I’m middle eastern too, and the community we have here would probably rally behind Saleh like crazy if he got the job. And honestly, I’m sure it’s something he’s thought about too. 

I’m not necessarily rooting for him to get the job, and a large part of me wants a more innovative offensive mind. But we really have no representation (positive, anyway) on a national scale in America, so a middle eastern coach *finally* turning the Lions around in the community with the largest Arab population in the country would be awesome, for sure."
8185,2020-12-15 20:33:33,kd725d,"Yeah I mean that's a very unique thing to our area is our Arab American population. Even on the west side of the state its not like that whatsoever.

I'd love it for him to be the guy to turn us around but the pessimistic ass in me says we need a hell of a lot more than a new coach to turn us around.

Martha needs to sell"
8186,2020-12-14 19:58:04,kd529r,Why the technicality on Kendall Hinton? He was 100% the starter that week.
8187,2020-12-14 19:55:14,kd529r,It's nice to not have a QB carousel for once NGL
8188,2020-12-14 19:59:43,kd529r,"11 actually. Garrett Gilbert started the Cowboys-Steelers game. Also, Dallas is 4-9."
8189,2020-12-14 19:58:44,kd529r,Didn’t Garrett Gilbert start a game for Dallas in week 9? That would make 11 for the NFC East.
8190,2020-12-14 20:00:09,kd529r,"~~Also, Ryan Finley has started for the Bengals this year.~~

Edit: nevermind, I was wrong about this one."
8191,2020-12-14 20:01:39,kd529r,Yeah idk why they felt the need to say it that way. He literally was starting QB.
8192,2020-12-14 20:06:58,kd529r,"I'm not sure if he was officially our starter that game. Lindsay took the first snap and PFR doesn't credit Hinton with a start. I guess you could say we didn't have a starting QB that game, even though everybody would consider Hinton our QB"
8193,2020-12-14 20:03:40,kd529r,"Smh how could they forget about AAF MVP, AAF champion, and Super Bowl champion Garrett Gilbert?"
8194,2020-12-14 20:15:19,kd529r,Huh. TIL.
8195,2020-12-14 20:14:53,kd529r,He did better than DiNucci and looked better than Dalton for a bit too
8196,2020-12-14 20:23:08,kd529r,I thought so too
8197,2020-12-14 18:55:04,kd3plx,I don't think Dat Boi Choi is getting cut
8198,2020-12-14 18:57:31,kd3plx,Stephens is not getting cut lmao
8199,2020-12-14 18:55:54,kd3plx,I agree with 60% of this list.
8200,2020-12-14 19:07:52,kd3plx,Where's JDS? 4 losess to KO/TKO in a row
8201,2020-12-14 19:07:32,kd3plx,"Polyana Viana has a scheduled fight and it's not even in 2020 lol how's is she  ""**almost definitely getting cut** ""?"
8202,2020-12-14 19:15:51,kd3plx,When a fighter gets cut do they get a call from Dana? Or is it just like a letter/email/text?
8203,2020-12-14 19:19:59,kd3plx,Mickey Gall almost definitely if his contract is worth literally anything
8204,2020-12-15 02:17:30,kd3plx,Emil meek?
8205,2020-12-14 19:16:13,kd3plx,"Some of these guys are scheduled to fight in 2021 tho. 

P.S. I don't think they'll cut Choi"
8206,2020-12-15 01:55:26,kd3plx,Out of all of these Hannah cifers must be a lock
8207,2020-12-14 18:58:10,kd3plx,"Some of those on the list have fights scheduled though, some are already cut."
8208,2020-12-14 19:21:35,kd3plx,"""**Shogun**, Sam Alvey (0-4-1 in his last 5)""
huh?"
8209,2020-12-14 18:59:14,kd3plx,But can we admire that Colby got his first prediction right in Ferguson vs Oliveria
8210,2020-12-15 02:16:48,kd3plx,Of all this list the only two I really hope will stay are Doo Hoi Choi and Jeremy Stephens
8211,2020-12-14 19:07:26,kd3plx,You’re almost definitely wrong about at least half of them.
8212,2020-12-15 07:05:52,kd3plx,"They wont cut only based on losses

They consider things like entertainment value, home country, and contracts"
8213,2020-12-15 17:02:59,kd3plx,"have doubts over Jamie Mullarkey ,Veronica Macedo and Doo-Ho Choi being cut."
8214,2020-12-15 00:36:06,kd3plx,Syuri got cut like a year ago lol
8215,2020-12-15 01:56:41,kd3plx,I think you’re misguided in boiling this down to wins and losses. Cost is going to play a major factor.
8216,2020-12-15 03:00:40,kd3plx,MAB is not getting cut he won his last fight but overturned because low amount of wtv in his piss
8217,2020-12-15 03:36:17,kd3plx,"I disagree with:

Struve, Medeiros, mullarky, elkins, stephens, choi, bektic, Assuncao, macedo, kish, cachoirea, andrea, penne, davis, dobson, polyana"
8218,2020-12-15 03:47:57,kd3plx,Cijfers is the ultimate sacrificial lamb.
8219,2020-12-15 05:46:27,kd3plx,"I think, other than those currently already booked for another fight, the only ones truly safe on this list are those who aren't coming off of a loss (Sam Alvey coming off a draw, Marc-Andre Barriault coming off a No Contest caused by a contaminated supplement, Priscila Cachoeira coming off a win) and ranked fighters who are at least two of the following three things; young, exciting, and not looking like they've necessarily lost a step in spite of having lost (Jeremy Stephens, Andrea Lee)."
8220,2020-12-15 06:10:37,kd3plx,"I don’t think you’re considering fighter pay in this list.  People that are getting cut are the ones with fat contracts.  It’s not just about losing, they’ve cut people with winning records in their last 5."
8221,2020-12-15 07:39:03,kd3plx,I feel enraged when I see Bektic's name. WTF is wrong with that guy and his forced wrestling that he even isn't that good at?
8222,2020-12-15 14:07:36,kd3plx,I think Brad Scott has already been released.
8223,2020-12-15 23:13:50,kd3plx,"You put a lot of work into this dubious speculation. 

Have an updoot."
8224,2020-12-16 14:20:08,kd3plx,Cowboy and JDS might be on that list also
8225,2020-12-18 07:46:25,kd3plx,"Cowboy will get one more fight in the UFC. If he loses again, then he's definitely gone."
8226,2021-01-21 18:45:57,kd3plx,Call me crazy but I don’t think Alessio will get cut
8227,2020-12-14 18:59:10,kd3plx,Tai Tuivasa needs to be on that list
8228,2020-12-14 19:03:10,kd3plx,"I hope the cuts happen as soon as possible, all this speculation is getting tiresome"
8229,2020-12-14 19:12:31,kd3plx,Add Rockhold to the list. Lost 3 of his last 4 (all via KO) and hasn’t fought in 17 months now and has nothing scheduled. He probably commands a decent paycheck but is old and not elite anymore so...he gone.
8230,2020-12-14 19:17:09,kd3plx,Jordan Espinosa is definitely not getting cut
8231,2020-12-14 19:11:14,kd3plx,Sadly agree with most of this list but I don’t see him getting cut. He’s way too exciting so I think they’ll give him at least one more shot.
8232,2020-12-14 19:22:11,kd3plx,"Cowboy, Gustaffson, Condit, Pettis, Jds, Arlovski might be the biggest names to go next"
8233,2020-12-14 18:57:32,kd3plx,He best not. He's still my Choi
8234,2020-12-14 18:59:45,kd3plx,I would be so sad. He’s the one who got me into mma.
8235,2020-12-14 19:08:28,kd3plx,"Stephens has an oddly long leash and gets way too much respect in the rankings despite being shot and not having won a fight in nearly 3  years. 

I agree he isn't getting cut but is there anybody in the top 10 of a division 135-170 (the divisions that are stacked AF in the UFC) that's less deserving then Jeremy Stephens? Al Iaquinta maybe."
8236,2020-12-15 15:51:04,kd3plx,That was the one that stood out to me as well. Dude's never in a shitty fight win or lose
8237,2020-12-16 14:19:24,kd3plx,Why wouldnt he?

8239,2020-12-15 02:30:52,kd3plx,"Former champ. Arlovski lost in pretty much the same fashion to Stipe, Overeem, Barnett (subbed not KO'd) and Ngannou. Then lost a decision to Tybura and after 5 in a row was given some can in a diaper named Junior Albini. JDS vs Arlovski is actually a fight that should happen, idk how they haven't crossed paths yet."
8240,2020-12-15 03:22:14,kd3plx,"All to guys who make probably will fight for a title, its not like he got beat by gian villante"
8241,2020-12-15 07:54:39,kd3plx,"The UFC doesn't really cut former champs. If they're on a bad run and ask for their release, they some times grant it, but I can't think of any former champs they've straight up cut."
8242,2020-12-14 19:20:47,kd3plx,Prachnio is on the McGregor card too
8243,2020-12-14 19:22:57,kd3plx,"I imagine it's between the matchmakers and the mangers, Dana only seems.to deal directly with the very top guys, and whoever is the flavour of the month."
8244,2020-12-15 02:05:08,kd3plx,they find out on twitter just like us lol
8245,2020-12-15 09:54:55,kd3plx,"I think Meek gets one more chance. The fans like him and if he can stuff the takedown, he's always exciting on the feet."
8246,2020-12-15 03:24:58,kd3plx,"I want them to give cifers one more chance, she sacrificed some of career taking short notice fights, one of them being above her weight class"
8247,2020-12-15 02:05:57,kd3plx,smilin probably autocorrected to shogun
8248,2020-12-14 19:08:51,kd3plx,broken clock
8249,2020-12-15 01:31:25,kd3plx,He was also right about Gaethje/Khabib tbf. But that was an easier fight to predict
8250,2020-12-15 01:20:49,kd3plx,Did she. I never heard anything about it.
8251,2020-12-14 19:04:04,kd3plx,Tai sucks but he’s coming off a win
8252,2020-12-15 08:40:45,kd3plx,Marketable
8253,2020-12-15 06:07:10,kd3plx,He’s also a former champion who is a big draw
8254,2020-12-15 03:26:10,kd3plx,Nah
8255,2020-12-15 07:55:52,kd3plx,They don't cut former champs.
8256,2020-12-14 19:27:27,kd3plx,Arlovski just won a fight tho?
8257,2020-12-15 02:05:45,kd3plx,Pretty sure Pettit’ contract is up after his next fight and there were rumors on here he may have taken it to get it over with and test the waters.
8258,2020-12-15 03:26:53,kd3plx,Condit is not going anywhere
8259,2020-12-15 02:22:21,kd3plx,"See you soon, Choi."
8260,2020-12-14 19:20:29,kd3plx,Agreed. Cub vs Choi is objectively in the top3 fights of 2016
8261,2020-12-15 01:56:21,kd3plx,His recent losses are all top 6 though. I think Jeremy would eat guys like Ige and others like Arnold Allen and Sodiq don't have very high quality wins.
8262,2020-12-14 20:52:28,kd3plx,They say they don't want gate keepers but Dana loves dos Anjos gate keeper ability. Isn't Marshman the Brit that went AWOL then released to fight in the UFC ? That's a harsh break.
8263,2020-12-14 19:16:21,kd3plx,"a reminder that facts don't drive UFC'S decision making all the time, Dana seems to like Stephens so he's probably fine"
8264,2020-12-15 00:55:50,kd3plx,Dana had personal beef with Romero though too
8265,2020-12-14 19:24:05,kd3plx,Stephens has UFC records and has been with them forever. He's also a decent sized name and a good litmus test for up and coming fighters.
8266,2020-12-15 10:30:17,kd3plx,"I doubt that saves him. He looked terrible in his last fights. Get's hit and basically turns away from the opponent and then gets finished.

If they do Arlovski vs JDS my money is on Arlovski."
8267,2020-12-15 10:15:16,kd3plx,Lol they just cut Anderson Silva
8268,2020-12-14 19:22:03,kd3plx,[deleted]
8269,2020-12-15 15:54:57,kd3plx,Plus they're aren't too many fighters from that part of the world. Same reason why I doubt Choi will get cut
8270,2020-12-15 01:45:38,kd3plx,Yeah she's been back in pro wrestling full-time and just signed a contract with a promotion called STARDOM
8271,2020-12-15 01:58:10,kd3plx,And he's a HW
8272,2020-12-15 01:59:36,kd3plx,Yeah he's 3-1 in his last 4 with the loss being to #3. Surprising good.
8273,2020-12-15 02:18:38,kd3plx,"His strength of schedule has been crazy for sure and it's worth pointing out he had his moments in all of those fights. He still needs to get back on track and #8 is too high at this point. I would put Allen and Soqid over him myself.  

I'd like to see him fight Ryan Hall myself."
8274,2020-12-15 13:08:02,kd3plx,"No they asked him to retire, he refused and asked to be released."
8275,2020-12-15 10:30:55,kd3plx,Exactly lol. And JDS looked bad in his losses.
8276,2020-12-14 19:23:18,kd3plx,"Exactly yeah, I’m pretty sure others on the list have fights on as well"
8277,2020-12-15 03:25:53,kd3plx,And he is in his 20s
8278,2020-12-15 10:34:28,kd3plx,Anderson Silva as a 45 year old looked better honestly lol
8279,2020-12-14 19:25:21,kd3plx,Wineland has a fight scheduled as well
8280,2020-12-14 16:10:07,kd02mq,"I want to draft a QB in the first, but I do have a question,

How have the lions built around stafford? You can’t just give him receivers, but no run game or offensive line, they’ve never built him a complete team, they give him receivers, but they didn’t have a running game for half a decade at one point, their offensive line has failed them in recent years, their defense has never produced well enough to win games, and stafford has never had a good play caller like Matt Ryan did when he won MVP, or Carson wentz when he was on the fast track to an MVP and Super Bowl before injury at the end of the season.

So stafford having a team built around him, is a false statement."
8281,2020-12-14 15:58:42,kd02mq,Mike Shanahan won a Super Bowl calling plays for Steve Young.  Trey Lance looks like that kind of player.  I also think Jamie Newman is worth a mid round shot.

8287,2020-12-14 19:56:19,kd02mq,"My personal wish list ranking

Darnold

Stafford

Draft a QB (don’t care who, as long as he can make plays outside the pocket)

Matt Ryan


Darnold’s physical ability is there. He can make all the throws and he has decent mobility. The Jets just did absolutely nothing to help him develop. 

Stafford and Ryan are known quantities.Both hover around that top 10 spot. But they’re going to be expensive. Plus Ryan is older that’s why I would prefer to draft over signing him

Don’t care who we draft. I trust Shanny there, but just draft someone who can make plays outside the pocket."

8294,2020-12-14 16:47:48,kd02mq,"Send over Beathard / Mullens and a 5th for Minshew. I am not saying he is our starter, but I would love him to compete for a spot / I just really do not want either of those dudes as our backup next year."

8298,2020-12-14 16:49:29,kd02mq,"Stafford is making around the same kind of money as Jimmy. With the way Jimmy's contract is structured we could release him for next to nothing (although I believe there would be plenty of suitors willing to give something up), there would be no big change in our cap situation if we got rid and brought in Stafford.

Dak is a pipe dream though."
8299,2020-12-14 16:03:15,kd02mq,I’ve read a lot of fans on this sub asking for one of these players to take the reigns next year and I’m just pointing out how they did yesterday.
8300,2020-12-14 16:55:19,kd02mq,What makes Stafford so good in your opinion?   4th quarter garbage stats.  Mullens puts up good numbers when the team is down 3 scores and defenses give up the underneath chunk yards.   There’s a reason why Staffords numbers look good but he’s 10 games under .500 as a starter.
8301,2020-12-14 16:50:08,kd02mq,Straight swap Jimmy and one of our third rounders from losing Saleh for Stafford.
8302,2020-12-14 20:51:55,kd02mq,"Also came on here to co-sign with this sentiment. Plus hiring Matt Patricia did not help at all and now they have to start over. It's almost like they drafted stafford 1st overall to go with calvin johnson, then just put the team on simulate mode hoping it would turn out well."
8303,2020-12-14 19:06:36,kd02mq,It would be Jimmy’s money PLUS a couple of picks.  No thanks.
8304,2020-12-14 16:47:10,kd02mq,You lose all credibility when you say the Lions have built around Stafford for 12 years. He is genuinely a top-5 talented quarterback in this league and they have done nothing but fail him for those 12 years.
8305,2020-12-14 16:53:39,kd02mq,"Not that I'm clamoring for any of these guys, but this is completely unfair for all the players on this list except Mullens, Wilson, and Jimmy G. Clearly, all those guys are on teams that are not very good (whether it's them, the coach, the supporting cast, or something else) - that's why they're on this list. Sometimes, when you put a guy in a different situation, the outcome is different.

Take Alex Smith for example. Look at his performance prior to Jim Harbaugh, and then what he's done with Harbaugh. The team was essentially the same, but he was a significantly better QB under Harbaugh simply because he had a better coach and system. He continued to prove this point under Andy Reid.

You take a look at a guy like Matt Ryan... under Shanahan, he had some of his best years. Since Shanahan left, that Falcon's team has looked... below average. With Shanahan as OC, the team was 11-5 and lost in the Super Bowl. Since then, the team has gone 10-6 (3rd in the division), and then 7-9, 7-9, and currently 4-9.

You can also point to Nick Foles as well. As an Eagle, he won a Super Bowl filling in for Carson Wentz. Since he's left the Eagles, people have been wondering where that player is.

The list goes on. What we have to do is consider the player's skillset and wonder whether it fits the system and what Shanahan is looking to do. And also whether this guy is even available or if they would even make sense financially. Falcons won't be cutting Matt Ryan - that's a $50mil hit... or a $23 and $26mil cap hit if designated as a post-6/1 cut. A trade isn't that much better... over $44mil. A Matt Stafford cut or trade makes *a little* more sense financially (almost $25mil dead cap). I still don't see that happening though. A Wentz trade/cut makes little sense too. Forget cutting him, that's over a $59mil cap hit. In terms of a trade... a team would have to really think he's going to bounce back next season because his base salary is $15.4mil next year and then over $20mil the next 3 seasons (non-guaranteed, so it'd pretty much be a 1-year deal). The Eagles would have to pretty much give him away for free or throw in something to sweeten the deal."
8306,2020-12-14 19:13:42,kd02mq,QB wins is a terrible stat since there are coaches and 52+ other players that aren't being accounted for.

8308,2020-12-14 19:17:48,kd02mq,We'll be getting compensatory picks from Saleh. Flip em right around for Stafford. Its foolish to not bring in a guy that immediately improves almost every aspect of our quarterbacking.
8309,2020-12-14 21:36:13,kd02mq,Seriously. These wins truthers must’ve just started watching the NFL or they would’ve remembered the exact same arguments being made for Mark Sanchez a decade ago
8310,2020-12-15 01:46:33,kd02mq,Having Patricia blow leads doesn't help your wins. A qb can only do so much. I would love to see Stafford in red and gold with a full compliment of weapons and Shanahan at the helm. Give me a legit dc when Saleh is gone to run the d. I don't want some up and comer as our DC who needs to learn in the job. Our window is still open if we do the necessary steps.
8311,2020-12-14 19:53:02,kd02mq,Do you honestly believe the Lions would give up their QB for some 3rd round picks?
8312,2020-12-14 20:08:43,kd02mq,I think the Lions would give up their franchise quarterback for that and Jimmy if Stafford says he wants to leave and play for a winner and they decide to blow it up.
8313,2020-12-14 20:33:33,kd02mq,Garoppolo also has a no-trade clause until 2022. Will Garoppolo want to play for the Lions and agree to your hypothetical trade?

8318,2020-12-15 10:13:59,kd02mq,He is wanted.
8319,2020-12-15 13:58:17,kd02mq,"Shanahan is on record saying Jimmy is our QB.

Also, we would have zero leverage to send him where we wanted. He would have to go to Detroit. If we didn't want him, his contract is non-guaranteed, so we can cut him. Knowing that, why would he go to Detroit unless it makes sense for him? Detroit is pretty much a dumpster fire right now.

Maybe the move puts Jimmy closer to home, since Detroit is closer to Chicago. And maybe if the Lions hired Saleh to be their next HC, he'll have some familiarity there. But his current contract has 2 non-guaranteed years on it. Based on his injury history, he's going to want some guaranteed money, so Detroit would have to re-work his contract. I think he'd only accept deals to probably the Bears or NE. Other than that, he'd want something in return."
8320,2020-12-16 05:17:26,kd02mq,I'd take Trubisky for him in a heartbeat. Maybe we could even get Khalil Mack or Eddie Jackson for our FRP and another piece?
8321,2020-12-16 13:53:18,kd02mq,"Trubisky? Wow - you're the first person I've heard of wanting Trubisky. Personally, I disagree, but maybe you see something that I don't.

As for Khalil Mack, I'm pretty sure he's virtually untouchable. For the price that the Bears paid for him, we'd have to give up a lot more than a 1st and another piece, unless that piece is Nick Bosa. Mack has been everything that they've hoped he would be. Having him play on the other side of Bosa would be insane, but it's nothing more than a pipe dream."
8322,2020-12-16 22:05:17,kd02mq,"I'd be willing to settle for an excellent pass rusher or DB. Trubisky is tough, mobile and can make good enough throws. Needs a fresh start and could hold up behind a rebuilding year for our OLine."
8323,2020-12-16 22:14:09,kd02mq,"Well, if the team feels similarly about him, we can just sign him. He's a FA after this year because the Bears declined his 5th year option."

He should be hiring a few staff to work on this.  Use student volunteers as well to help give these guys a support network.  It should be someone’s job to contact these guys at least once per day (or a few times per week) and make sure they are feeling welcome and have someone to talk to.  Taper it off as they move up from Freshman to Sophomore and then probably not needed after they go from Soph to Junior but something like this would probably help retention improve."

This seems to be making the assumption that all 4 or 5 star talent will always become great players, and if they dont its only because of coaching.and no 3 stars can ever become some of the best in the game.

Of the many things I'm getting critical about regarding this staff, the situation I'm most disappointed in was in the 4th quarter with about 6 minutes left on the clock. On 4th down and down 10 points, we kick a field goal and Minnesota gets called for an offsides penalty, which can give us a new series of downs if we choose to accept the penalty, but it also wipes away 3 points. Scott Frost elects to accept the penalty and in essence said, ""We're playing for the touchdown and the win.""

I'm not wholly against this idea, but he declared that he was not accepting 3 points and wanted 7. I also would have been critical, but understanding, had we not converted after 4 downs in that scenario; it is an aggressive call that has a huge downside if it doesn't work out, but the potential for a huge momentum swing if we convert. Instead we burn 2 minutes off the clock, make no forward progress, and we elect to kick a field goal on 4th down anyway.

Let's ignore the decision to open the game with a swing screen thrown into the wind, a pass that is already difficult to get consistently with an NFL quarterback, much less Adrian Martinez. Let's also ignore the decision that we asked Luke McCaffrey, with lesser throwing ability and also into the wind, to throw the ball for an almost sure interception. Let's also ignore some critical errors made by players that took our momentum away, including Cam-Taylor Britt getting a targeting penalty against a scrambling Tanner Morgan slid 10 yards away from a first down and will not ever be confused as a running QB, along with Ethan Piper being called for holding on a touchdown while completely away from the play because he didn't stay standing and instead went down with the defender, a motion that refs are trained to call whether or not you feel a hold actually occurred.

Instead, I'm going to focus in on the fact that we have a head coach who has lacked understanding of what the other team's gameplan has been for three years--burn clock and limit Nebraska possessions. We have a coach who by kicking the 3 points after attempting to go for the touchdown in that situation showed that he panicked and made a rash decision about the offense instead of understanding what his defense had done all game and could do to put the team in a position to win. We have a coach who is so focused on the offense working that he doesn't see the layout of the game as a head coach and is still coaching the game like a coordinator. We ended up losing because Minnesota, with 33 players missing, played for clock and we failed to understand that.

Not helping his cause is [his statement about media timeouts ruining the tempo of his offense, which effectively says that his offense only works when played on the Pac-12 Network or ESPNU.](https://saturdaytradition.com/nebraska-football/scott-frost-gripes-about-frequency-of-media-timeouts-after-loss-to-minnesota/) Or that he doesn't see that the fault may be with him, but with someone or something else.

It's possible he can figure things out and make it work here at Nebraska. With the past three years of history showing though, that's looking much more unlikely."
8367,2020-12-14 14:39:51,kcy2s3,"> If a coach is getting talented players and not translating it to on the field success, the coach needs to look in the mirror regarding player development and retention. 

Not necessarily. Recruiting, like drafting in the NFL, is a crystal ball business. You can bring in a kid who was dominant in high-school, given a good rating by the all the ""experts"", and the find out he just can't cut it at the next level.

8370,2020-12-15 05:33:23,kcy2s3,"I always love the Urban Meyer quote (that I think he took from someone else), about the things they measured in their program.  

Recruiting and **Development**.  If you're bringing in great recruiting classes, and those guys aren't getting drafted into the NFL, then you have to examine your player development.  

Urban made sure that wherever he went, that he also brought in his strength and conditioning coach. It was a *requirement* in his contract negotiations.  Saban has said the strength and conditioning coach might be the most underrated position in all of college football.  NCAA limits practice time, so these guys literally end up spending more time with the athletes than the coaches do.  

Nebraska is recruiting well, but not developing guys well.  We all know that though because we stopped putting guys in the NFL.  Not just that, but we can see it with the drop off in second half performance and missed tackles in the second half (again, a sign of conditioning).  

Even better, [is we have actual stats showing recently how important the position is today.  Brian Kelly hired Balis from UConn on the heels of a 4-8 season in 2016. While wins and losses are far from an ideal metric for judging strength and conditioning coaches, it’s probably worth noting the Fighting Irish are 43-6 since Balis arrived in South Bend](https://247sports.com/college/penn-state/Article/College-football-best-strength-and-conditioning-coaches-NFL-Combine-Dwight-Galt-Chris-Doyle-144582852/)


Even better, is that one of the guys from that article is jobless right now. One of the best strength and conditioning coaches in the nation is jobless right now and a car ride away from Lincoln.  The best stat from that article is that Iowa didn't recruit well, but was able to convert these guys into top performers at the combine.  Only one of their top NFL draftees was a four star recruit, the rest were three star, two star, and WALK ONS.  He was just fired from Iowa, which means one of the best Strength and Conditioning coaches is jobless right now.  

Especially after seeing Nebraska look smaller against Minnesotas Covid backups, and seeing the drop off in second half performance...I think it's fair to say that this is one of the biggest improvements Nebraska **needs** to make."
8371,2020-12-14 14:32:14,kcy2s3,"I think blaming the refs and the conference is the way to go. I mean that last holding call was absolute poppy cock. And the conference gave us a ridiculous schedule. 

Fact is that the officials have decided a majority of games this season. They could have called holding on Minnesota in that game. Instead they make a terrible call on a scoring play on Nebraska? 

Meanwhile this year Wisconsin has also had a terrible season.  And you know a big part is that their defense actually started to get called for pass interference after the Michigan game where a series of no call mistakes were made. After that somehow the officials decided to end a multi year streak of just letting Wisconsin do whatever on D. 

Officials decide games. Maybe Northwestern is just a good way to give Ohio State a blowout win or whatever the reason is, the conference wants Northwestern this year. Who knows who they will pick next year. Maybe they will let Wisconsin do its thing and pick them. Or maybe they will let Iowa hold every drive and go with them. Who knows."

8376,2020-12-14 14:49:52,kcy2s3,"This is it right here.  The amount of transfers and guys kicked off the team not only results in these top classes becoming mid-range classes, its messes up the scholarship counts so that you are never really maximizing your available scholarships.  This is what happened to KU.

You can only ADD 25 new scholarship plays a year, so when a guy transfers out (for example our 4 FL kids from this past class), you can't just swap out that scholarship for another transfer.  The staff is doing well with backing into some talent via walk on transfers (Martin and Miller, both 4*s from Iowa and Nouili from CSU) because they can join the team as a walk-on, get a scholarship later and that scholarship doesn't count towards the 25 per year, just the total 85.


While recruiting, scholarships, talent blah blah blah is all important, I don't care how much talent is at Nebraska- the game plan, sloppy play, and complete lack of fundamentals seems to be bigger issues.  We might be the 'most talented' team in the west, but as we see with Texas in the B12, Georgia in the SEC East, talent is just part of the equation."

Frost recruiting is a moot point as far as I'm concerned."
8378,2020-12-14 19:54:36,kcy2s3,I'm just saying the same thing I guess but considering the bulk of each class leaves these top 25 classes in the 50s at best.

Certainly some of those 3* guys will be contributors, some will be total busts, and some will outperform their expectations. 

I think the underrated advantage of this class is the large proximity of guys close to Nebraska. From what I’ve heard with recruiting gurus, they expect a lot less attrition from this class than the 2020 guys."
8380,2020-12-14 17:28:18,kcy2s3,Stars aren't everything. A lot of major contributors to their respective teams were recruited as 3 stars.

We really need a consistent QB to see this offense do anything, and I don't think we've got that on the roster right now. Adrian is Adrian, Luke just isn't a very good passer, and from the few accounts I've heated, Smothers isn't a great passer either. We've got 2 (possibly 3) QBs who are great runners, but just can't get the passing game going like it needs to."

So its not simply that 4-5 star recruits are always the best, but that they go to the best universities that can routinely develop talent from any level and put their players in positions to win with great supporting players. Plus the players there get to learn from their upper classmen, which is important.

We definitely lack veteran leaders. For example Spielman wouldve been a great leader for the WR group. Now its like Wandale and Warner."
8407,2020-12-15 01:16:26,kcy2s3,"This is some real motivated reasoning. There are only a couple 5-star qbs (or any position) and hundreds of 3- stars.  So a much MUCH MUCH higher percentage of 5/stars get to the NFL.  There are more 3 stars in the NFL because there are thousand and thousands more three star players over the course of a football generation.  How can somebody make the argument that 5-stars aren’t better players?  To do that you literally have to not know a single thing about statistics, probabilities and common sense."
8408,2020-12-14 16:58:29,kcy2s3,"Yes. 3 years in a program is more than enough time for guys to mature in a scheme. I understand the off-season sucked, but it was more or less the same for everybody, not to mention the fact that Nebraska was one of the few places in the Big Ten that had players on campus all summer. If the guys Riley left over are that bad then they shouldn’t see the field, and if your guys you brought in aren’t up to snuff by junior or redshirt sophomore year then something has to change. Not saying Frost should be canned after this season, but most coaches that have success at a football program are starting to roll in year three. We are still at square one."

Frost is out here blaming media timeouts for losses. Zac Taylor benched Gio Bernard for his first fumble in over 800 carries. Bo Pelini was throwing his guys under the ""execution"" bus when his scheme was giving up 600 yards a game.

If these guys are so concerned with people taking responsibility and being accountable, maybe they can start with themselves. Yea, the players or whoever might have fucked up, but it's on you to prepare to overcome, no matter what goes wrong."

8413,2020-12-15 14:32:34,kcy2s3,"Right, and Chris Olave was a big talent coming out of high school with 20 offers many from top schools.  We offered him.  It was 247sports who rated him as a solid 4 star, but the composite ratings dragged him down to a 3 star, meaning the others (rivals and espn I think) must have rated him poorly probably out of ignorance.

Also, look at Luke Reimer.  He probably could have been a 4 star recruit if he had had the proper exposure.  Instead he was an unrated walk-on with only a few minor offers.  Now he is one of our best players."
8414,2020-12-15 01:41:56,kcy2s3,"Why does every argument have to include words like “always”? 

Read a statistics 101 book or just Google “basic statistics”.  Nothing happens “always” except the sun coming up in the East.  And even that won’t happen one day a long time from now.  

The anticipated future performance of a recruit is based on his perceived or measured current value and future probabilities.  Every single analysis of recruit rankings and NFL contribution shows a tight, statistically significant alignment between stars snd NFL success.  That means that a 5-star is THE MOST LIKELY to succeed, not that he will ALWAYS succeed.  

A certain percentage of 4-stars make the NFL as do a certain percentage of 3-stars.  As more and more data is generated by a coaching staff, you can see if they put players in the NFL at a greater or lesser frequency with their average-star talent compared to other staffs and the aggregate benchmarks.

None of this is opinion.  It’s just incredibly basic data analysis.  

Value comes in to the program in the form of recruits. You can measure that value with stars.  The greater the sample the more accurate the measurement.  The relative value of that input compared to other schools tells you the staff’s recruiting ability. 

Then value comes out if the program in the form of players getting drafted and eventually contributing at the NFL level.   

The ratio of those two values tells you the development output of the coaching staff. 

There’s also a similar analysis you can do comparing recruiting rankings and wins (weighted of course by the relative rankings of both rosters).  You don’t have to be an excel nerd to figure approximately where the current NU staff would rank out of 130 FBS teams liking back through 4 cycles.  

Every situation is different, and context matters, so the data might not tell the whole story about something as subjective as Frost’s total coaching performance.  

But the data looks bad.  

And there’s no statistical or logical argument in existence that supports the assertion that higher ranked players aren’t better and more likely to contribute positively in every instance.   

Note, I’m not saying “alway will be better”.    Am saying they are “always more likely to be better”.   But what they become is probabilistic just like trying to tell the future is ALWAYS probabilistic."

Most of Frosts recruits aren't juniors/RS sophomores. The only ones that are are that class he managed to get while he was still coaching another school. And that class was realistically tiny because of that. Most of them were guys that had issues that made other schools not want them, and didn't stick around. 

But the ones that *were* solid are the leaders on the team this year: 2AM, Jurgens (for the hate he gets over the snaps, he's the only O lineman who can throw a run block), and Cam Taylor-Britt.

I'm hopeful for a big leap forward next year when Frost's O line recruits have had a few years of strength training under their belt. There have been some seriously impressive O line recruits the last couple years, but this ain't basketball; you can't go from high school to FBS and expect to hold your own on the line. I think a lot of problems on this team go away once we can consistently run the ball on designed run plays, and that takes an O line designed for running, not whatever Riley was recruiting for."

8438,2020-12-15 03:13:31,kcr5i2,This 4th qtr has me ERECT

8440,2020-12-15 02:58:39,kcr5i2,"Bucks sub hating on the mavs, and mavs sub hating on the mavs lmao"
8441,2020-12-15 01:30:55,kcr5i2,Luka trying to bond with Giannis over FT struggles. All part of a long play lads
8442,2020-12-15 01:40:15,kcr5i2,Willie Caulie Stein counter: 5
8443,2020-12-15 03:22:00,kcr5i2,Josh green is a great pick
8444,2020-12-15 03:23:07,kcr5i2,I can literally see potential in all our rookies what a great draft by the FO!
8445,2020-12-15 01:40:26,kcr5i2,That bucks commentator has called james johnson wille caulie three times
8446,2020-12-15 02:59:20,kcr5i2,Good lord Josh Richardson is on fire. Even hit that near buzzer beater
8447,2020-12-15 03:21:52,kcr5i2,JOSH FUCKING GR33N
8448,2020-12-15 03:23:43,kcr5i2,Our second unit really man handled the Bucks starters in the 4th quarter rolf
8449,2020-12-15 03:24:14,kcr5i2,Just want to remind you guys that we’ll be adding KP to this team here in a bit also. I’m excited.
8450,2020-12-15 01:33:42,kcr5i2,"I’m sorry but 

I’m taking Kleber defense and 3pt shooting over Powell lob threat"
8451,2020-12-15 01:40:16,kcr5i2,"""Over Willie Caulie-Stein!"" 😄😅"
8452,2020-12-15 02:13:45,kcr5i2,It's just preseason guys.
8453,2020-12-15 03:12:49,kcr5i2,Me coming back to positive comments after doomers were out in full force during the first half lol
8454,2020-12-15 02:03:47,kcr5i2,Powell is a negative on both sides of the floor
8455,2020-12-15 02:12:08,kcr5i2,Richardson is so nice
8456,2020-12-15 02:15:55,kcr5i2,Can y’all relax? This is literally preseason
8457,2020-12-15 02:20:30,kcr5i2,Luka is the last player I'm worried about. He wants to win more than any of us. Y'all need to chill
8458,2020-12-15 02:52:36,kcr5i2,"luka at 27 8 4 lol

def heard us talking shit"
8459,2020-12-15 02:58:55,kcr5i2,"We look good but this team is CLEARLY one player away. 

We need somebody like that Tingus Pingus dude who used to be on the Knicks and we're contenders"
8460,2020-12-15 03:06:35,kcr5i2,"This Brunson, Burke, Green, Maxi, WCS lineup was the one that broke the lead open last game and it’s doing the same this game lol"
8461,2020-12-15 03:21:21,kcr5i2,I love how our bench supports our Rooks. You could see the smile on Bey's face
8462,2020-12-15 01:32:17,kcr5i2,Man I love Josh Richardson
8463,2020-12-15 01:32:31,kcr5i2,J-RICH IS SUCH A FUCKING FIT!
8464,2020-12-15 02:53:08,kcr5i2,Maybe I’m over reacting but it looks like we won the trade with the Sixers. Absolutely loved Seth but he was a major liability on defense
8465,2020-12-15 02:54:52,kcr5i2,LOOK HOW GOOD WE ARE WITHOUT POWELL
8466,2020-12-15 03:13:16,kcr5i2,U would think the Bucks announcers are Mavs fans. They talking hella shit about the Bucks bench
8467,2020-12-15 03:13:25,kcr5i2,WCS = The Other Motherfucker from Dallas
8468,2020-12-15 03:13:34,kcr5i2,Can we have more of this WCS please?
8469,2020-12-15 03:14:22,kcr5i2,WCS > Powell for me right now
8470,2020-12-15 03:22:12,kcr5i2,Green is going to be one of my favorite players.
8471,2020-12-15 03:22:17,kcr5i2,Terry spamming the A button after every defensive rebound.. Dude chill lol
8472,2020-12-15 03:22:47,kcr5i2,Please keep Boban for the rest of his career.
8473,2020-12-15 01:32:18,kcr5i2,lmao @ sixers fans saying don't expect J-Rich to make threes.
8474,2020-12-15 01:40:51,kcr5i2,Holy fuck we are beyond deep wtf??
8475,2020-12-15 01:45:58,kcr5i2,I am buying all the James Johnson stock
8476,2020-12-15 01:46:04,kcr5i2,James Johnson is a way better over all player than I thought he was. His defense especially surprised me.
8477,2020-12-15 01:54:28,kcr5i2,"I think we are all waiting for the true star of this team to come in.

NATE HINTON"
8478,2020-12-15 02:30:34,kcr5i2,JRich is the greatest shooter in history
8479,2020-12-15 02:31:19,kcr5i2,Didn't realize JRich moonlights as Seth Curry.
8480,2020-12-15 02:31:50,kcr5i2,"At this point, it's clear that we need to start Klebar. He's just a better defender, shooter, and probably more athletic at this point."
8481,2020-12-15 02:35:51,kcr5i2,Josh Richardson outplaying Jrue Holiday.
8482,2020-12-15 02:50:05,kcr5i2,That's luka talking shit to r/mavericks
8483,2020-12-15 02:59:28,kcr5i2,"The Bucks can be so fortunate we haven't mobilized our greatest threat yet, Nate Hinton"
8484,2020-12-15 02:59:50,kcr5i2,Replace powell with Kleber and all of a sudden the defense looks elite
8485,2020-12-15 03:11:10,kcr5i2,Josh Green trying to do anything he can on defense is nice to see.
8486,2020-12-15 03:12:09,kcr5i2,WILLY STRETCH 5! CONFIRMED LEAGUE IS FUCKED!
8487,2020-12-15 03:12:20,kcr5i2,Bruh is WCS a better shooter than Dwight?
8488,2020-12-15 03:12:55,kcr5i2,Wcs 🔥🔥🔥
8489,2020-12-15 03:13:01,kcr5i2,Looking like Josh Green will be a solid player going forward
8490,2020-12-15 03:13:22,kcr5i2,Giannis gotta looking over all jealous of Luka being able to sit on the bench while the lead  keeps growing.
8491,2020-12-15 03:20:26,kcr5i2,Boban trying to give these rookies a lot of chances
8492,2020-12-15 03:21:08,kcr5i2,I really have no idea what to do when I see all these defensive plays lol. It feels so foreign to me
8493,2020-12-15 03:21:32,kcr5i2,Josh Green is SOLID
8494,2020-12-15 03:21:44,kcr5i2,TERRY TO GREEN FOR 3 IM FUCKIN HYPE RN FOR THIS SEASON LMAO
8495,2020-12-15 03:24:10,kcr5i2,Giannis is so coming to Dallas!!
8496,2020-12-14 07:17:28,kcr5i2,We have to bully Luka online into losing weight while pretending to be Lakers fans. This will yield the best future timeline. Yoda has spoken.
8497,2020-12-15 02:10:43,kcr5i2,Y’all overreacting to a preseason game lmao
8498,2020-12-15 01:31:50,kcr5i2,Josh Fucking Richardson
8499,2020-12-15 02:04:00,kcr5i2,Powell just shot faked himself out of his own shot.
8500,2020-12-15 02:08:38,kcr5i2,Luka kinda chucking right now lmao
8501,2020-12-15 02:09:46,kcr5i2,Hope Luka’s in form before the nationally televised games
8502,2020-12-15 02:20:58,kcr5i2,"Ok I’m out of here, you guys are ridiculous"
8503,2020-12-15 02:40:57,kcr5i2,Imagine the alley oops Luka and Giannis can produce?
8504,2020-12-15 02:41:29,kcr5i2,I love what i’m seeing from JRich so far. perfect fit on this team
8505,2020-12-15 02:49:49,kcr5i2,oh shit Lukas fat ass got in shape during the game my b
8506,2020-12-15 02:57:05,kcr5i2,Bucks commentators are actually praising Luka a lot. Not bad to listen to.
8507,2020-12-15 02:59:05,kcr5i2,Damn.... is JRich a legit 3rd star?
8508,2020-12-15 02:59:17,kcr5i2,Holy shit JRich can't miss
8509,2020-12-15 03:12:08,kcr5i2,Josh green fan club check in
8510,2020-12-15 03:12:57,kcr5i2,WILLIE!
8511,2020-12-15 03:13:29,kcr5i2,I like these announcers a lot more than I expected to
8512,2020-12-15 03:14:50,kcr5i2,Where are all my cauley Stein haters get in here!!!!!!!
8513,2020-12-14 05:20:36,kcr5i2,"Considering Luka will probably get more playing time, I'm really interested to see how well he attacks the basket against Jrue Holiday with the extra weight he's put on"
8514,2020-12-15 02:02:55,kcr5i2,Lukas fat ass needs to get himself in shape
8515,2020-12-14 06:36:17,kcr5i2,Another chubby Luka thread it seems.
8516,2020-12-15 01:31:47,kcr5i2,JRich for Seth Curry is looking *really* good right now.
8517,2020-12-15 01:32:43,kcr5i2,"Turns out we just traded Seth for Steph, let’s goooo"
8518,2020-12-15 01:32:45,kcr5i2,I hope Coach Carlisle sees that we are so much better with Maxi starting at the 5. Dwight Powell ain’t it.
8519,2020-12-15 01:46:05,kcr5i2,"James ""Get that shit outta here"" Johnson"
8520,2020-12-15 02:01:46,kcr5i2,"THJ forces a contested deep 3           

Me: Come on Jimmy          

THJ Actually makes it          

Me:  👁👄👁"
8521,2020-12-15 02:19:18,kcr5i2,"Im not trippin on some of those Luka misses, those shots will start going in second half. I am however bummed at the Finals level of crowd noise being pumped in to the arena at weird times."
8522,2020-12-15 02:33:40,kcr5i2,You guys are embarassing but tbh i love it sigh we all feed off the drama
8523,2020-12-15 02:41:18,kcr5i2,Giannis is the PF version of Russell Westbrook 😂
8524,2020-12-15 02:52:59,kcr5i2,luka heard you guys talking shit
8525,2020-12-15 02:59:31,kcr5i2,Philly suppressed jrich
8526,2020-12-15 03:00:37,kcr5i2,I think Dallas won that trade with Philly lol...
8527,2020-12-15 03:00:56,kcr5i2,bruh how did the sixers ruin jrich this much? he looks like a completely different player here
8528,2020-12-15 03:04:16,kcr5i2,Burke on 4m a year is fraud lol
8529,2020-12-15 03:06:45,kcr5i2,Those WCS 3s videos were real wtf
8530,2020-12-15 03:06:50,kcr5i2,That james johnson is good
8531,2020-12-15 03:12:03,kcr5i2,WCS wasn’t lying
8532,2020-12-15 03:12:05,kcr5i2,WILLEYS IG AINT NO CAP
8533,2020-12-15 03:12:19,kcr5i2,WCS SHOOT THAT THANG BIG FELLA!
8534,2020-12-15 03:13:13,kcr5i2,PROFESSOR TRILL IM BOUT TO BUST
8535,2020-12-15 03:13:27,kcr5i2,"WCS is 100% from beyond the arc in his career as a Mav

We found our new Curry."
8536,2020-12-15 03:14:07,kcr5i2,WCS with a jumper is a ducking MONSTER
8537,2020-12-15 03:16:01,kcr5i2,I can not wait for all the premium WCS memes
8538,2020-12-15 03:17:32,kcr5i2,I felt more urgency from this (preseason) game than half of last season's regular season games lol
8539,2020-12-15 03:23:19,kcr5i2,This team 😍😍😍
8540,2020-12-15 03:23:57,kcr5i2,We are making that statement to Giannis
8541,2020-12-15 03:24:07,kcr5i2,Obviously they just lost but Giannis does not look happy. Looking like Lebron in the Finals game 5 2014
8542,2020-12-15 03:24:43,kcr5i2,"Dallas is playing this good without Giannis, imagine when he arrives?"
8543,2020-12-15 01:08:26,kcr5i2,I’m a Bulls fan. I bought League Pass to watch Bulls games. Black out area. No Bulls games. Will watch Mavs games instead. I’m gonna hang out here with you guys.
8544,2020-12-15 01:31:41,kcr5i2,JRICH IS ON FIRE
8545,2020-12-15 01:32:21,kcr5i2,Dammit JJohnson! That was a filthy pass!
8546,2020-12-15 01:38:24,kcr5i2,Are they going to call Johnson WCS the whole game?? Lmao
8547,2020-12-15 01:40:50,kcr5i2,"For sure there's a lot here acting like they didnt hate that Seth - J rich trade now


Edit: And a lot loves Brunson again now after wanting him gone last season after the Trey Burke bubble performance lol"
8548,2020-12-15 01:49:38,kcr5i2,I'm really liking johnson so far
8549,2020-12-15 01:50:17,kcr5i2,"James Johnson and Richardson looking like great acquisitions, and while Luka garners the attention, Brunson also quietly continues to develop nicely. You love to see it."
8550,2020-12-15 01:53:23,kcr5i2,This bench squad ain't it tonight lol
8551,2020-12-15 02:02:47,kcr5i2,God I can’t wait til KP is back
8552,2020-12-15 02:06:30,kcr5i2,Remember when Luka's floater was deadly on his rookie season? What the hell happened?
8553,2020-12-15 02:24:08,kcr5i2,Games like this are good. They mean nothing and serve as a wakeup call.  Rick is going to  have to make some adjustments on the defensive side until KP comes back
8554,2020-12-15 02:30:49,kcr5i2,Jrich is a sniper
8555,2020-12-15 02:32:00,kcr5i2,"The team is smiling, all is good in the world"
8556,2020-12-15 02:33:21,kcr5i2,Watch JRich's 3p% be better than our boy Seth's in Philly this year lol
8557,2020-12-15 02:38:31,kcr5i2,luka starting to get those shots near the rim finally and opening everything else
8558,2020-12-15 02:55:43,kcr5i2,JRich is a way better shooter than I thought. He fits our system perfectly.
8559,2020-12-15 02:59:04,kcr5i2,JRich is cracked
8560,2020-12-15 03:04:26,kcr5i2,Defense is improved but the offense didn't even take a hit. Seems legit.
8561,2020-12-15 03:06:11,kcr5i2,they really need a pointguard
8562,2020-12-15 03:06:40,kcr5i2,WCS FOR 333
8563,2020-12-15 03:06:55,kcr5i2,Those WCS practice shots paid off
8564,2020-12-15 03:06:56,kcr5i2,WET WILLY!
8565,2020-12-15 03:06:59,kcr5i2,"WCS, more like WTF?!"
8566,2020-12-15 03:07:08,kcr5i2,Let’s fucking go Willie!
8567,2020-12-15 03:07:14,kcr5i2,Yeah that WCS 3 is what I really wanted to see in game after the workout video. Shit looks really nice.
8568,2020-12-15 03:07:20,kcr5i2,PROFESSOR TRILL STRETCH BIG
8569,2020-12-15 03:09:43,kcr5i2,Holy shit calm down with the Dwight hate everyone. He's coming back from a huge injury and it's his 2nd game. He's also a 20mpg player who will most likely be replaced by KP in the lineup
8570,2020-12-15 03:12:10,kcr5i2,WE. HAVE. A. SQUAD.
8571,2020-12-15 03:12:25,kcr5i2,JOSH GREEN 3
8572,2020-12-15 03:12:26,kcr5i2,Oh my god y’all I’m so hyped up rn
8573,2020-12-15 03:13:49,kcr5i2,Give WCS The max
8574,2020-12-15 03:14:44,kcr5i2,LET’S GO WET WILLIE! WCS
8575,2020-12-15 03:20:45,kcr5i2,Bobi with the thumbs up after receiving a pass  😊
8576,2020-12-15 03:23:36,kcr5i2,Well that was fun
8577,2020-12-15 03:25:38,kcr5i2,Both team starters played 28+ mins. It was almost a regular season game and we looked crisp
8578,2020-12-15 02:21:53,kcr5i2,Look at all these casual fan knee jerk reactions.  It’s the pre season
8579,2020-12-15 01:17:59,kcr5i2,"luka bby, bruh"
8580,2020-12-15 01:19:33,kcr5i2,I honestly think Luka is playing at like 50% speed just trying not to get hurt out there.
8581,2020-12-15 01:23:59,kcr5i2,Luka is Lebroning the preseason
8582,2020-12-15 01:27:37,kcr5i2,Imagine getting baited by a Powell pump fake
8583,2020-12-15 01:31:39,kcr5i2,Richardson is about to replace Curry's 3 point percantage lol
8584,2020-12-15 01:32:12,kcr5i2,That James Johnson pass was insane
8585,2020-12-15 01:32:15,kcr5i2,Shooters are feasting with Luka
8586,2020-12-15 01:33:51,kcr5i2,Josh Richardson is going to shoot 40% from 3 this year isn't he
8587,2020-12-15 01:34:02,kcr5i2,[deleted]
8588,2020-12-15 01:34:03,kcr5i2,I see carlisle is mixing it up with the line up. This game is rick's toy factory. Meanwhile bucks needs a win to prove something
8589,2020-12-15 01:38:38,kcr5i2,I am in love with the effort James Johnson is putting out there. Dude is flying around the court setting solid ass screens
8590,2020-12-15 01:48:00,kcr5i2,"Some team, at some point in Brunson’s career is going to pay him to be a starting PG"
8591,2020-12-15 01:54:13,kcr5i2,James Johnson's effort is impressive
8592,2020-12-15 01:56:32,kcr5i2,"ok, would say the current lineup is definitively not working"
8593,2020-12-15 01:58:21,kcr5i2,bro Powell is unplayable idc what anyone says
8594,2020-12-15 02:03:00,kcr5i2,Sucks that the streaming sites only have the Bucks broadcast booth
8595,2020-12-15 02:04:12,kcr5i2,Powell is cheeks
8596,2020-12-15 02:04:31,kcr5i2,Powell absolutely cannot defend
8597,2020-12-15 02:04:48,kcr5i2,Can Dwight Powell defend anyone?
8598,2020-12-15 02:29:16,kcr5i2,It's crazy how this sub can go from 80 to 8 in a quarter
8599,2020-12-15 02:29:53,kcr5i2,yall need to chill on Powell. He probably doesn't trust his Achilles yet
8600,2020-12-15 02:34:58,kcr5i2,I forgot about Seth already.. J Richardson is on freaking fireeee<3 18 point game in pre season.. I mean that was a steall!
8601,2020-12-15 02:41:04,kcr5i2,where all the preseason doomers at from 2nd quarter lmao.
8602,2020-12-15 02:42:46,kcr5i2,"Maybe this is all part of the recruiting plan,  make giannis enjoy the idea of taking on powell in practice"
8603,2020-12-15 02:42:53,kcr5i2,That hesi move from Luka was dirty
8604,2020-12-15 02:43:31,kcr5i2,Dwight Powell is unplayable against real centers. Having flashbacks here. Let WCS get some run.
8605,2020-12-15 02:43:38,kcr5i2,LUKA starting to come alive with the drives
8606,2020-12-15 02:52:52,kcr5i2,JRich looks good in blue
8607,2020-12-15 02:55:31,kcr5i2,That defense has really improved.
8608,2020-12-15 02:55:50,kcr5i2,This game is wayyyy more competitive than it should be which means its more entertaining for us fans
8609,2020-12-15 02:57:06,kcr5i2,"and the Bucks are talking about Doncic not really having ""athleticism"" as if he can't carve up and drive on any defense in the league

edit: their commentators, not the team"
8610,2020-12-15 02:59:06,kcr5i2,Even when it doesn’t count he still makes it. Nobody’s gonna trade with us anymore
8611,2020-12-15 03:00:06,kcr5i2,"Thanks for that quarter Luka, I needed it to kill off some stupid anxieties."
8612,2020-12-15 03:06:28,kcr5i2,jalen been ballin
8613,2020-12-15 03:06:55,kcr5i2,Fuck it. Let's go Boban and WCS dueling threes.
8614,2020-12-15 03:06:57,kcr5i2,"WILLY THREE! I REPEAT, WILLY THREE! LEAGUE IS FUCKED!"
8615,2020-12-15 03:11:09,kcr5i2,Nice floater by Green.
8616,2020-12-15 03:11:37,kcr5i2,WCS be like “this is how you shoot a 3 Giannis”
8617,2020-12-15 03:11:55,kcr5i2,WILLIE VIDEOS WERE REAL
8618,2020-12-15 03:12:07,kcr5i2,ACTIVE SHOOTER ALERT
8619,2020-12-15 03:12:48,kcr5i2,Green got Middleton on a lock and then hitting a three? Time to change my pants then.
8620,2020-12-15 03:12:50,kcr5i2,Yo this bench unit is fire!
8621,2020-12-15 03:13:14,kcr5i2,HOLY FUCK WILLIE
8622,2020-12-15 03:14:06,kcr5i2,THE TRILL SNIPER
8623,2020-12-15 03:14:46,kcr5i2,Smooth hand Willie
8624,2020-12-15 03:15:50,kcr5i2,I know its trash minutes but WCS splashing 3s has me hopeful he can be a great roleplayer in this team.
8625,2020-12-15 03:18:22,kcr5i2,To think we can only get better once KP's back.
8626,2020-12-15 03:22:26,kcr5i2,good fucking D green why is that not a offensive.
8627,2020-12-15 03:24:26,kcr5i2,we got a squad
8628,2020-12-15 01:40:55,kcr5i2,"Brunson gonna average 50 points this season, upvote if you agree"
8629,2020-12-15 01:55:54,kcr5i2,Maaaybe our bench isn’t as good as their starters....
8630,2020-12-15 02:10:56,kcr5i2,"If Luka is gonna shoot 50% from free throws, then it's gonna be super hard to close out games"
8631,2020-12-15 02:07:33,kcr5i2,"Hey I'm a pistons fan, but I'm from Dallas and love watching Luka play. Holy shit y'all are so toxic for such a spoiled fan base. I mean y'all keep getting generational talent and fun basketball, but all y'all do is bitch and moan nitpicking players in the fucking preseason."
8632,2020-12-14 19:59:23,kcr5i2,I wish some reporter would just ask Luka about his weight/diet. That way we finally get an answer and people can just shut up about the topic for a while.
8633,2020-12-15 01:17:14,kcr5i2,this fake crowd noise is awful
8634,2020-12-15 01:24:44,kcr5i2,"Doncic heading the ball?

Cross and Inshallah lol. If you know; you know"
8635,2020-12-15 01:26:47,kcr5i2,J-Rich shooting like curry wtf
8636,2020-12-15 01:26:50,kcr5i2,JRich is fucking bucket
8637,2020-12-15 01:28:09,kcr5i2,If J-Rich gets his feet set and has a bit of time he seems automatic.
8638,2020-12-15 01:31:35,kcr5i2,"0/6FTs 
LMAO"
8639,2020-12-15 01:31:41,kcr5i2,OH MY J-RICH

8642,2020-12-15 01:31:57,kcr5i2,Luka ma average a few less points this year but hes going to get like 11 asst. A game.
8643,2020-12-15 01:32:09,kcr5i2,KL3BER
8644,2020-12-15 01:32:09,kcr5i2,JRiCh hasnt miss a 3
8645,2020-12-15 01:32:35,kcr5i2,Johnson and Richardson are better than expected so far.
8646,2020-12-15 01:32:41,kcr5i2,Jrich looks amazing and...I mean do I have to point out how much better we play on both sides with maxi over powell?
8647,2020-12-15 01:32:51,kcr5i2,"James ""Magic"" Johnson"
8648,2020-12-15 01:33:24,kcr5i2,Good to see Maxi hitting shots again.
8649,2020-12-15 01:35:47,kcr5i2,Richardson is gonna have a career year with Luka
8650,2020-12-15 01:37:52,kcr5i2,this team feels like it might be very good...
8651,2020-12-15 01:38:31,kcr5i2,J rich gettin fired up in Pre-season. Really liking this guy
8652,2020-12-15 01:39:12,kcr5i2,someone needs to tell him thats not wcs...
8653,2020-12-15 01:39:18,kcr5i2,this is all with out our second best player too
8654,2020-12-15 01:43:57,kcr5i2,We don't even have our second best player back 😐😐 LETS GO MAVS
8655,2020-12-15 01:46:21,kcr5i2,I just love that Johnson set picks all the freakin time lol.
8656,2020-12-15 01:49:43,kcr5i2,"Bonding over football, or should we say headball"
8657,2020-12-15 01:57:45,kcr5i2,THJ was just murdered.
8658,2020-12-15 02:02:01,kcr5i2,Timmy playing with a little “fuck you” right now
8659,2020-12-15 02:02:30,kcr5i2,JRich glowing
8660,2020-12-15 02:04:06,kcr5i2,Hmm....Doncic is playing weird.
8661,2020-12-15 02:04:07,kcr5i2,Luka airballing quite a lot.
8662,2020-12-15 02:04:51,kcr5i2,Please get Powell off the floor
8663,2020-12-15 02:05:38,kcr5i2,thats 3 airball layups for luka
8664,2020-12-15 02:22:47,kcr5i2,Powell is not rolling hard to the rim anymore
8665,2020-12-15 02:27:18,kcr5i2,I'm curious how WCS would look out there with the starters instead of Powell.
8666,2020-12-15 02:37:26,kcr5i2,jrich guarding three guys there was beautiful
8667,2020-12-15 02:38:57,kcr5i2,Who the fuck is working the crowd noise machine? Middleton commits offensive foul *crowd goes fuckin nuts!
8668,2020-12-15 02:41:12,kcr5i2,J Rich will definitely become one of my favorite Mavs player if he stays like this on his run here on Mavs
8669,2020-12-15 02:43:15,kcr5i2,Omg luka why would you shoot tha-- OMG HE MADE IT
8670,2020-12-15 02:43:23,kcr5i2,Welcome back luka

8672,2020-12-15 02:51:40,kcr5i2,lukas three ball looks legit
8673,2020-12-15 02:54:57,kcr5i2,We've looked incredible this quarter.
8674,2020-12-15 02:59:05,kcr5i2,"That was too late by a hair, but damn that man is on fire"
8675,2020-12-15 03:06:58,kcr5i2,WILLIE 3 uhhhhhhhhhh

8678,2020-12-15 03:09:10,kcr5i2,This bench is fire!! Probably the best mavs bench in years. Jalen absolutely leads the pack. Born to lead.
8679,2020-12-15 03:10:53,kcr5i2,Josh Green is very good guys
8680,2020-12-15 03:11:42,kcr5i2,WCS FOR 3
8681,2020-12-15 03:11:52,kcr5i2,Willie stop im gonna bust
8682,2020-12-15 03:11:53,kcr5i2,Wtf WCS is a stretch 5???
8683,2020-12-15 03:12:00,kcr5i2,WCS is our Seth replacement and nobody can convince me otherwise
8684,2020-12-15 03:13:03,kcr5i2,WCS relaxxxxx
8685,2020-12-15 03:13:07,kcr5i2,WCS LETS FUCKING GO
8686,2020-12-15 03:13:07,kcr5i2,HOLY SHIT WILLIE!!!
8687,2020-12-15 03:13:34,kcr5i2,WCS YOU FKN BEAST
8688,2020-12-15 03:13:56,kcr5i2,WCS looks in great shape. Could be a big difference maker if motivated.
8689,2020-12-15 03:16:15,kcr5i2,Burke and JB combo is scary good
8690,2020-12-15 03:16:38,kcr5i2,Fuck you guys are looking good
8691,2020-12-15 03:17:02,kcr5i2,WCS as a starter not fckn DP.. He didnt do Jack in 22 mins...
8692,2020-12-15 03:17:30,kcr5i2,Boban hits a 3 and Im gonna flip my coffee table
8693,2020-12-15 03:19:00,kcr5i2,Terry receiving a Boban screen looks photo shopped
8694,2020-12-15 03:19:04,kcr5i2,Oh It's Boban and his kids again lol
8695,2020-12-15 03:19:20,kcr5i2,"Josh Green is gonna need to learn to take more shots as he progresses, he kind of does the same thing Delon did last year where he passes when he has a good shot. 

Looks good though otherwise, super excited about him!"
8696,2020-12-15 03:19:25,kcr5i2,is josh green who we wanted jj to be
8697,2020-12-15 03:21:33,kcr5i2,Josh Green hitting it now
8698,2020-12-15 03:23:28,kcr5i2,Terry looks better this game altho he does pickup the dribble too much. I think he will be thr best used with a guy like luka besides him so he isnt the primary ballhandler
8699,2020-12-15 03:25:11,kcr5i2,[deleted]
8700,2020-12-15 02:18:40,kcr5i2,Just refreshed the thread and holy f what kind of a toxic cesspool this sub has become lmao.
8701,2020-12-15 01:34:00,kcr5i2,Having five shooters on the floor changes the whole offense. Maxi has to be the starter and Powell has to come off the bench as a spark plug.
8702,2020-12-15 02:07:28,kcr5i2,how did Luka's FTs get WORSE
8703,2020-12-14 12:50:28,kcr5i2,They came for vengeance but only found misery
8704,2020-12-15 01:08:48,kcr5i2,Of course our stream is the only one that doesn't work.
8705,2020-12-15 01:16:54,kcr5i2,jrich 4/5 on his threes so far
8706,2020-12-15 01:17:59,kcr5i2,was that a lob or a floater haha
8707,2020-12-15 01:20:16,kcr5i2,Giannis struggling to score on doe doe
8708,2020-12-15 01:22:46,kcr5i2,Luka out there playing like he in his mom's driveway playing his little cousins lol.
8709,2020-12-15 01:27:28,kcr5i2,Jrich about to average 70% from 3 in Dallas
8710,2020-12-15 01:29:05,kcr5i2,all of jrich 5/6 threes have been all net
8711,2020-12-15 01:31:12,kcr5i2,So much for Giannis's new FT motion
8712,2020-12-15 01:31:43,kcr5i2,BUCKETS
8713,2020-12-15 01:31:45,kcr5i2,Lol Bucks think Johnson is WCS.
8714,2020-12-15 01:32:12,kcr5i2,This is beautiful basketball. Wow
8715,2020-12-15 01:32:15,kcr5i2,That was HYPEEE
8716,2020-12-15 01:32:16,kcr5i2,MOAR BUCKETS
8717,2020-12-15 01:32:42,kcr5i2,PP HARD
8718,2020-12-15 01:32:46,kcr5i2,naaaasty pass luka
8719,2020-12-15 01:33:23,kcr5i2,🤙Call me maxi
8720,2020-12-15 01:33:44,kcr5i2,"Great play by James Johnson, hard cut to show himself to JRich and knew who the open guy was."
8721,2020-12-15 01:34:04,kcr5i2,This ball movement holy hell
8722,2020-12-15 01:35:03,kcr5i2,Holy cow this team is GELLIN
8723,2020-12-15 01:35:16,kcr5i2,what a series of passes from luka and james
8724,2020-12-15 01:39:05,kcr5i2,"Jalen ""baby luka"" Brunson"
8725,2020-12-15 01:39:54,kcr5i2,Did not think this was going to be a 30 point quarter after the forst 6 minutes lol
8726,2020-12-15 01:39:57,kcr5i2,AND 1 BRUNSON
8727,2020-12-15 01:40:03,kcr5i2,"If DonThic is a lethal shooter but DonSlim is a Lebron-level finisher, who y’all picking??"
8728,2020-12-15 01:40:08,kcr5i2,"Yess Brunson 

Elite Backup PG"
8729,2020-12-15 01:41:05,kcr5i2,We're still leaving 3 point shooters open too much.
8730,2020-12-15 01:43:18,kcr5i2,Maxi Threeber
8731,2020-12-15 01:44:00,kcr5i2,I hope kleber and richardson can take this hot shooting into the regular season. Were gonna need it.
8732,2020-12-15 01:44:35,kcr5i2,Maxi: im coming for you kawhi
8733,2020-12-15 01:46:53,kcr5i2,Johnson actualy looks great!
8734,2020-12-15 01:48:00,kcr5i2,Is Josh Green really 6’6 tho?
8735,2020-12-15 01:48:10,kcr5i2,Johnson looks like a fucking dawg. Super super happy with how he’s playing
8736,2020-12-15 01:48:29,kcr5i2,Imagine porzingis and Johnson as our front court
8737,2020-12-15 01:48:35,kcr5i2,Giannis wanting to play with his head too
8738,2020-12-15 01:53:24,kcr5i2,"Well, this isn't the most fun of periods tbh..."
8739,2020-12-15 01:53:45,kcr5i2,Lmao definitely some rust on this bench unit
8740,2020-12-15 01:54:02,kcr5i2,Dammit i wanna win this game now
8741,2020-12-15 01:54:07,kcr5i2,Giannis should just start shooting his free throws from the three point line
8742,2020-12-15 01:54:13,kcr5i2,"I know JJ just got swatted but I love how comfortable he is bringing the ball up the floor and handling it. 

He's gonna be able to make 1-2 plays per game with that skillset and really come in clutch as long as he doesn't try to do too much."
8743,2020-12-15 01:54:19,kcr5i2,Luka not in game? Giannis looks upset :P
8744,2020-12-15 01:54:25,kcr5i2,"trade powell, i insist"
8745,2020-12-15 01:58:45,kcr5i2,How the fuck is that legal from Jrue???
8746,2020-12-15 02:00:45,kcr5i2,Dwight Powell is fucking BBQ chicken
8747,2020-12-15 02:01:32,kcr5i2,Literaly what the fuck does powell bring to the floor at this point? Yes I know it is only preseason but I can just see him being a huge point of frustration for another full season.
8748,2020-12-15 02:01:37,kcr5i2,"Its a game of runs, we made ours, they made theirs, we need to calm down lol"
8749,2020-12-15 02:06:35,kcr5i2,Cmon Luka
8750,2020-12-15 02:07:29,kcr5i2,Gonna need a Boban injection
8751,2020-12-15 02:12:36,kcr5i2,Jesus we can’t finish layups tonight.
8752,2020-12-15 02:13:41,kcr5i2,I’m watching FC Dallas vs Minnesota United with all these headers.
8753,2020-12-15 02:30:38,kcr5i2,dwight heard you guys saying he can’t jump
8754,2020-12-15 02:30:45,kcr5i2,Josh is a grown ass man
8755,2020-12-15 02:31:06,kcr5i2,Richardson 4/4 on 3s.
8756,2020-12-15 02:33:13,kcr5i2,"If they see Powell taking a 3, they better start running back on defense and get a head start on the opposing transition"
8757,2020-12-15 02:34:23,kcr5i2,"JRich is better than I hoped, really a steal."
8758,2020-12-15 02:34:58,kcr5i2,Stop passing so needlessly Luka!
8759,2020-12-15 02:35:17,kcr5i2,Officiating has been crap tonight.
8760,2020-12-15 02:37:14,kcr5i2,Friendship ended with buzzer beaters. Now taking charges is my best friend.
8761,2020-12-15 02:42:33,kcr5i2,Luka’s stroke looks so much more pure
8762,2020-12-15 02:43:27,kcr5i2,Luka's 3 point shot has been pure.
8763,2020-12-15 02:44:10,kcr5i2,I feel like Rick should’ve given Powell an easier ramp up to basketball activity than guarding Giannis. Lol.
8764,2020-12-15 02:50:45,kcr5i2,I’m getting way too hype for preseason😅
8765,2020-12-15 02:52:51,kcr5i2,"Now I aint saying that Jrich will be an improvement on seth in terms of shooting, but man aint missing so far lol"
8766,2020-12-15 02:53:37,kcr5i2,I like this Mavs team a lot.
8767,2020-12-15 02:54:15,kcr5i2,We won that Sixers trade y'all
8768,2020-12-15 02:56:44,kcr5i2,why is robert fucking porter cooking us
8769,2020-12-15 02:57:13,kcr5i2,Luka mad af
8770,2020-12-15 03:00:15,kcr5i2,"Pretty competitive 3rd

Unleash the Boban"
8771,2020-12-15 03:00:23,kcr5i2,3rd quarter used to be our achilles heel
8772,2020-12-15 03:01:12,kcr5i2,that jrich shot counted in my heart
8773,2020-12-15 03:03:01,kcr5i2,"If we do get Giannis, can we somehow keep Richardson? We need to keep him."
8774,2020-12-15 03:04:17,kcr5i2,Pretty damn competitive & entertaining for preseason game
8775,2020-12-15 03:05:27,kcr5i2,"Giannis really is something special to watch. 

I think the odds aren't great that we get him, but my god that would be sweet."
8776,2020-12-15 03:06:51,kcr5i2,WILLIE WONKA????!!!? HOW
8777,2020-12-15 03:06:58,kcr5i2,Apparently he can hit them in a game. Lol
8778,2020-12-15 03:07:01,kcr5i2,Willie with the THREEEEE. He needs Dwight’s minutes low key
8779,2020-12-15 03:07:33,kcr5i2,Our bench is gonna run some second units off the floor this year man!
8780,2020-12-15 03:07:49,kcr5i2,RICKS SYSTEM HAS EVEN MADE WCS A SHOOTER
8781,2020-12-15 03:08:02,kcr5i2,Lol our bench toasting they bucks starters
8782,2020-12-15 03:09:30,kcr5i2,"wcs did make 15 threes in a row all net in a work out, hes worked on that shot"
8783,2020-12-15 03:11:05,kcr5i2,The only problem is we don't want Giannis harboring resentment because we keep kicking their asses
8784,2020-12-15 03:11:25,kcr5i2,WCS wtf
8785,2020-12-15 03:11:32,kcr5i2,Some of y’all dummies were crying in the first half of the game about some of the most ridiculous shit.
8786,2020-12-15 03:11:40,kcr5i2,Omfg WCS wtf
8787,2020-12-15 03:11:46,kcr5i2,Willie 👌💦

8789,2020-12-15 03:11:49,kcr5i2,That’s it! WILLIE TAKE ALL THE MINUTES!!
8790,2020-12-15 03:11:53,kcr5i2,UHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
8791,2020-12-15 03:13:09,kcr5i2,"Yeah, Willie needs to be in the rotation"
8792,2020-12-15 03:13:15,kcr5i2,I think Mark Cuban hired Holger Geshwinder as a shooting coach during the offseason
8793,2020-12-15 03:13:15,kcr5i2,Yooooooo
8794,2020-12-15 03:14:06,kcr5i2,WILLIE WTF
8795,2020-12-15 03:14:40,kcr5i2,We are 12 deep lets go!!
8796,2020-12-15 03:15:05,kcr5i2,I think the bench reaction is the best part about Willie's 3s
8797,2020-12-15 03:16:27,kcr5i2,I BEEN DONE SAYING NEED TO RESIGN WCS ALL THE HATERS SOCK MY DOCK RNNNN
8798,2020-12-15 03:16:38,kcr5i2,"I almost said “can we have more of this Willy, please?”

Until I realized how that reads. Gonna be a lotta dick jokes if WCS plays this year."
8799,2020-12-15 03:16:46,kcr5i2,TERRY SIGHTING BACK THE FUCK UP OFF ME
8800,2020-12-15 03:18:11,kcr5i2,"I really, really like the potential of Josh Green. Maybe not instant impact this year, but for a future he could be massive piece if we play our cards right.

Remember, Luka is gonna eat the cap space soon so making our own pieces is very important because we won't be able to sign them easily."
8801,2020-12-15 03:18:44,kcr5i2,looks like the floater god jjackson passed on his skills to josh green before he left
8802,2020-12-15 03:18:47,kcr5i2,What a floater by JJacks i mean JGreen
8803,2020-12-15 03:19:04,kcr5i2,Did the Bucks try to get their own Luka?
8804,2020-12-15 03:19:21,kcr5i2,Ok I see you terry
8805,2020-12-15 03:21:07,kcr5i2,that was a good pass by terry too bad boban couldnt hold on to it
8806,2020-12-15 03:21:24,kcr5i2,Big uncle Boban and the kids
8807,2020-12-15 03:21:44,kcr5i2,"All around great win for us! Not a regular season game, but glad we got the sweep! Hell yeah!! MFFL"
8808,2020-12-15 03:22:25,kcr5i2,I hope we see a lot more or this where the starters and bench put the game away by the 3rd quarter like the warriors in 2016
8809,2020-12-15 03:23:39,kcr5i2,FUCK YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
8810,2020-12-15 03:27:37,kcr5i2,It would be an understatement to say I'm excited af.
8811,2020-12-15 02:07:43,kcr5i2,Luka gotta admit he worked on nothing this off season lol
8812,2020-12-15 02:11:52,kcr5i2,Luka having an absolute nightmare of a game tonight
8813,2020-12-15 02:16:21,kcr5i2,"I immediately regret visiting this thread tonight. Holy shit y’all, it’s a preseason game."
8814,2020-12-15 02:24:49,kcr5i2,"Aye Mav's fan, your toxicity is leaking again"
8815,2020-12-15 01:09:00,kcr5i2,"Both my streams are frozen, rippp."
8816,2020-12-15 01:14:48,kcr5i2,I love Jrich already
8817,2020-12-15 01:17:02,kcr5i2,anyone got a stream with FSSW?
8818,2020-12-15 01:17:46,kcr5i2,"Someone count the ""as a player"" quotes"
8819,2020-12-15 01:19:09,kcr5i2,JRich is definitely a huge upgrade and is a certified starter
8820,2020-12-15 01:23:29,kcr5i2,Brook Lopez looks like an Easter Island statue
8821,2020-12-15 01:23:33,kcr5i2,I’m really liking JRich
8822,2020-12-15 01:25:10,kcr5i2,at least luka still having fun
8823,2020-12-15 01:25:31,kcr5i2,"Luka on Jrue like ""I remember you"""

8825,2020-12-15 01:28:43,kcr5i2,Luka trying to get free throw practice lol.
8826,2020-12-15 01:30:28,kcr5i2,luka gonna average 30 this year on 30/40 from the lineup
8827,2020-12-15 01:31:29,kcr5i2,James johnson is here

8831,2020-12-15 01:32:39,kcr5i2,Richardson looking really good.
8832,2020-12-15 01:32:50,kcr5i2,"Im calling it now, MAXI and JRICH gonna average 40% from 3s this season"
8833,2020-12-15 01:33:23,kcr5i2,It's raining 3's baby!! 📞📞📞📞
8834,2020-12-15 01:33:55,kcr5i2,Looking fucking good boys
8835,2020-12-15 01:35:54,kcr5i2,If y’all got Heat J Rich who was a good 3 point shooter and not the version we saw last year then the league should be scared
8836,2020-12-15 01:37:24,kcr5i2,this guy shoots better from 3 than from the line
8837,2020-12-15 01:37:26,kcr5i2,"Rick gonna play Luka 48 minutes to
Get him in shape"
8838,2020-12-15 01:43:46,kcr5i2,Kleber is on fire too
8839,2020-12-15 01:43:52,kcr5i2,maxi found his shot lol
8840,2020-12-15 01:44:45,kcr5i2,Maxi is shooting lights out
8841,2020-12-15 01:46:52,kcr5i2,just at eye test our defense look alot better than last year.
8842,2020-12-15 01:47:13,kcr5i2,Whistles in mid season form already. Lol.
8843,2020-12-15 01:47:58,kcr5i2,Josh Green is a LOCKDOWN DEFENDER 🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🔒🔒
8844,2020-12-15 01:49:07,kcr5i2,Giving up a lot of open 3s
8845,2020-12-15 01:49:33,kcr5i2,Awww it's kinda cute watching green play. You can definitelyyyy  tell he's a rookie
8846,2020-12-15 01:51:30,kcr5i2,Maxi and James Johnson look like some Solid Rotational Players!
8847,2020-12-15 01:55:29,kcr5i2,You guys talked up Brunson a bit too much so he had to airball a 3 to get us back to reality
8848,2020-12-15 01:57:49,kcr5i2,Bruh our guys just got mugged on that possession
8849,2020-12-15 01:58:19,kcr5i2,This is not fun anymore
8850,2020-12-15 01:58:25,kcr5i2,Refs in postseason form already.
8851,2020-12-15 01:58:55,kcr5i2,"Gotta get rid of Powell, for real."
8852,2020-12-15 01:59:49,kcr5i2,Free throw woes my god
8853,2020-12-15 02:02:13,kcr5i2,THJ is a chucker but when his shoots fall hes a great chucker
8854,2020-12-15 02:02:55,kcr5i2,Why the hell is Powell guarding Giannis? Put him on Portis.
8855,2020-12-15 02:04:18,kcr5i2,Powell literaly looks like a lost kid playing with grown men
8856,2020-12-15 02:15:04,kcr5i2,"I have no worries about J Rich now, dude can ball. 

The others must step up though"
8857,2020-12-15 02:33:06,kcr5i2,"The way this threads go in and out are too much, fucking emotional rollercoaster everytime"
8858,2020-12-15 02:38:49,kcr5i2,Giannis look real unhappy. Like reaaaal unhappy. \**rubs hands together\**
8859,2020-12-15 02:41:45,kcr5i2,We need to build a wall..and make the bucks pay for it.
8860,2020-12-15 02:44:07,kcr5i2,"okay, luka heard us talking about his 7-11 body"
8861,2020-12-15 02:47:56,kcr5i2,It’s only pre-season but Doe Doe out there looking dangerous this year from 3.  People better start respecting his catch and shoot looks like he’s been busy in the off season.
8862,2020-12-15 02:48:10,kcr5i2,I hope we can keep richardson no matter what happens in the offseason
8863,2020-12-15 02:49:40,kcr5i2,I have two Luka jerseys coming tomorrow and I couldn't be more excited!
8864,2020-12-15 02:49:55,kcr5i2,That was a lefuckyou three towards the refs from Luka
8865,2020-12-15 02:51:38,kcr5i2,Richardson is a DOG!!
8866,2020-12-15 02:51:45,kcr5i2,Luka waking up!
8867,2020-12-15 02:51:53,kcr5i2,our team is going to compete with the best of them this year ... so pumped guys
8868,2020-12-15 02:52:18,kcr5i2,Richardson is suddenly my 2nd favorite player.
8869,2020-12-15 02:52:40,kcr5i2,"When Luka is playing seriously, he's getting good results."
8870,2020-12-15 02:55:28,kcr5i2,The whole team heard us talking shit apparently! Loving this
8871,2020-12-15 02:56:08,kcr5i2,Rick got in that ass during halftime!
8872,2020-12-15 02:56:29,kcr5i2,"Maxi I love you, but please grab the fucking rebound"
8873,2020-12-15 02:58:01,kcr5i2,"luka just say “oh no no, it’s bullshit coach?”"
8874,2020-12-15 03:01:28,kcr5i2,So how much money will JRich be paid next season?
8875,2020-12-15 03:02:56,kcr5i2,I see why Bucks fans hate their coach.
8876,2020-12-15 03:03:35,kcr5i2,"bruh we own the bucks, if we make the finals, I hope we play them."
8877,2020-12-15 03:05:10,kcr5i2,Maxi nearly caught a body sheesh.
8878,2020-12-15 03:06:51,kcr5i2,Oh my god it finally happened lmfao
8879,2020-12-15 03:07:01,kcr5i2,"""what cant giannis do!?"" make it to the ecf's?"
8880,2020-12-15 03:07:04,kcr5i2,TRILLY

8886,2020-12-15 03:07:42,kcr5i2,This audition for Giannis is going pretty good 😏
8887,2020-12-15 03:09:39,kcr5i2,JB really is a lesser version of luka WHICH IS STILL PRETTY DAMN GOOD
8888,2020-12-15 03:10:08,kcr5i2,I think it's gonna be a fun year guys!
8889,2020-12-15 03:11:35,kcr5i2,That floater made me oii oii oii

8893,2020-12-15 03:12:15,kcr5i2,"When even WCS drains from distance, it's going to be a long night for the other side"
8894,2020-12-15 03:12:32,kcr5i2,Greens Jumper Is Smooootthhh
8895,2020-12-15 03:12:34,kcr5i2,LETS GOOOO BOYS
8896,2020-12-15 03:12:42,kcr5i2,Luka started playing for about 6 mins in the 3rd
8897,2020-12-15 03:12:44,kcr5i2,Willieeee
8898,2020-12-15 03:12:45,kcr5i2,WILLI3

8901,2020-12-15 03:14:21,kcr5i2,This team is loaded! GG
8902,2020-12-15 03:14:56,kcr5i2,Last 5 minutes? Now the REAL game starts
8903,2020-12-15 03:15:27,kcr5i2,"Willie ""instant offense"" Stein, wat?"
8904,2020-12-15 03:15:57,kcr5i2,Trey - > Willie
8905,2020-12-15 03:16:38,kcr5i2,And this is WITHOUT KP. Man...
8906,2020-12-15 03:17:01,kcr5i2,Man The Bucks ain't shit lol ol soft ass dudes all they can do on d is foul minus Giannis.
8907,2020-12-15 03:18:37,kcr5i2,Damn Green has some moves.
8908,2020-12-15 03:19:38,kcr5i2,we get 4 mins of nate hinton to top this w off
8909,2020-12-15 03:20:48,kcr5i2,This is wonderful sloppiness.
8910,2020-12-15 02:17:20,kcr5i2,jesus those overreactions lmao
8911,2020-12-15 01:32:53,kcr5i2,Giannis ain't staying in Milwaukee for this lol. Team looks worse than last year.
8912,2020-12-15 02:05:28,kcr5i2,Luka needs to check his shot selection at the moment
8913,2020-12-15 01:32:38,kcr5i2,Luka’s lateral speed was never good but it’s a LOT slower right now
8914,2020-12-15 01:39:38,kcr5i2,It’s not WCS you dumb fuck
8915,2020-12-15 01:57:57,kcr5i2,"Like it or not powell just aint it. It isnt even the injury, he had same problems before. Man cant shoot and cant guard a living thing, this just isnt an nba C at all"
8916,2020-12-15 02:04:42,kcr5i2,Luka’s touch on his floaters have been ass these past two games. Leaving everything short
8917,2020-12-15 02:05:13,kcr5i2,Powell is obviously a huge weak link
8918,2020-12-15 02:10:46,kcr5i2,Powell is useless with his diminished athleticism
8919,2020-12-15 02:12:48,kcr5i2,Powell trying to defend his defense with that block
8920,2020-12-15 02:17:20,kcr5i2,I hope Luka sucks ass tonight so that this game serves as a wake up call. Better during preseason than during regular season.
8921,2020-12-15 02:45:55,kcr5i2,I never really understood why people said /r/mavericks was toxic until I followed this game thread...
8922,2020-12-15 03:21:47,kcr5i2,This bench lineup would sweep the 2011 Mavericks
8923,2020-12-14 05:26:59,kcr5i2,"Luka has to get rid of that extra 7-10 kg as soon as possible in order to get in the MVP contender shape.

I don't know but at the season 3rd if he comes to the season start in that chubby shape there needs to be something changed immediately in his nutrition coaching or private life."
8924,2020-12-14 08:43:38,kcr5i2,I wonder if Rick will play more with lineups instead of just doing full on line changes.
8925,2020-12-14 16:46:37,kcr5i2,How are y’all watching this since basically everyone doesn’t have FSSW anymore??
8926,2020-12-15 01:09:11,kcr5i2,anyone have a stream that works???
8927,2020-12-15 01:10:31,kcr5i2,Anyone got a stream?
8928,2020-12-15 01:14:10,kcr5i2,heres a stream  https://www.streameast.live/basketball/dallas-mavericks-milwaukee-bucks-2/
8929,2020-12-15 01:16:25,kcr5i2,J-Rich MY MAN!
8930,2020-12-15 01:16:47,kcr5i2,We're sharing the ball this year.
8931,2020-12-15 01:21:45,kcr5i2,"I know this will probably be downvoted but I just dont get the Powell forcig and hope it wont happen in regular season. Man is the same defensive liability, still cant rebound, cant shoot and now isnt as explosive in P&R which was the only thing he used to be truly elite at. I know alot of you love the guy but if we ever look to truly contend the guy cant be playing any meaningful minutes."
8932,2020-12-15 01:21:59,kcr5i2,Idk what is about Brook Lopez but I fucking hate him.
8933,2020-12-15 01:22:04,kcr5i2,"@all, in season adjustments with powell will happen. think rick just wants to get him in rhythm in a low pressure situation"
8934,2020-12-15 01:22:13,kcr5i2,"For the people worrying about Luka, he just heaved up a borderline running sky hook, I don’t think he’s taking this super cereal. I think he’s just trying stuff out and trying to stay healthy."
8935,2020-12-15 01:25:34,kcr5i2,Dwight Powell runs like a Playstation nba2k player
8936,2020-12-15 01:26:12,kcr5i2,he couldnt help that soccer headbutt
8937,2020-12-15 01:26:15,kcr5i2,Luka hasnt made a shot yet but still look like he is cooking holiday for some reason
8938,2020-12-15 01:26:28,kcr5i2,Jrich money
8939,2020-12-15 01:28:15,kcr5i2,our unselfishness as a team is making me so happy. jrich is a perfect fit
8940,2020-12-15 01:28:38,kcr5i2,"oh no Luka, not the FTs"
8941,2020-12-15 01:30:12,kcr5i2,I hate how Luka is so much like LeBron at the free throw line. Don’t gotta idolize LeBron on that.
8942,2020-12-15 01:30:35,kcr5i2,What is growing out of Giannis' shoulder?
8943,2020-12-15 01:32:26,kcr5i2,Call em up Maxi!
8944,2020-12-15 01:32:29,kcr5i2,Beautiful basketball
8945,2020-12-15 01:32:49,kcr5i2,Wow what a sequence
8946,2020-12-15 01:33:44,kcr5i2,how many assists do luka have ?
8947,2020-12-15 01:33:58,kcr5i2,"Bucks announcer called James Johnson ""Willie Caullie Stein""... 🤔🤔"
8948,2020-12-15 01:36:48,kcr5i2,"Luka for 3

WET!!"
8949,2020-12-15 01:37:12,kcr5i2,Luka 3s looking good tho 👀
8950,2020-12-15 01:37:13,kcr5i2,That 3 looks pure Luka
8951,2020-12-15 01:37:48,kcr5i2,I’m in love with this team already I think
8952,2020-12-15 01:40:05,kcr5i2,JBrunson so good
8953,2020-12-15 01:42:31,kcr5i2,"Did some1 else notice that Brunson looks more muscular/lean this season, since ever?

Or i am blind."
8954,2020-12-15 01:43:49,kcr5i2,Kleber has evolved.
8955,2020-12-15 01:43:56,kcr5i2,Maxi is feasting
8956,2020-12-15 01:45:27,kcr5i2,Karate chopped that ball lol
8957,2020-12-15 01:46:38,kcr5i2,I really hope Brunson can be better in the fourth quarter this season. Loved him for the most part last year but he made a lot of mistakes when he was playing in clutch time.
8958,2020-12-15 01:46:43,kcr5i2,Burke showing nice defensive awareness
8959,2020-12-15 01:47:18,kcr5i2,good hands!
8960,2020-12-15 01:47:37,kcr5i2,Johnson is a defensive powerhouse in the paint I love to see it
8961,2020-12-15 01:48:49,kcr5i2,Wilson guy has looked good in both games so far. And JJ giving us some Defense.
8962,2020-12-15 01:54:08,kcr5i2,Giannis 50-40-90 club when?
8963,2020-12-15 01:57:34,kcr5i2,Lopez too big for Dwight
8964,2020-12-15 01:58:24,kcr5i2,Harrell would have been pretty useful.
8965,2020-12-15 02:00:52,kcr5i2,Damn THJ that was way from the line
8966,2020-12-15 02:05:10,kcr5i2,Nice to get a nonsense call for us for once.
8967,2020-12-15 02:06:47,kcr5i2,Another missed free throw.
8968,2020-12-15 02:08:33,kcr5i2,"Oh dear, oh dear. FTs not falling in today"
8969,2020-12-15 02:12:30,kcr5i2,He wasnt touching the ball when he stepped out
8970,2020-12-15 02:13:59,kcr5i2,Shoot that Luka! Don't pass it!
8971,2020-12-15 02:14:06,kcr5i2,How does this game look if we have KP?
8972,2020-12-15 02:21:30,kcr5i2,"Look powells main asset has always been a lob threat in the PnR. I hope it’s pure rust but we’re in for a tough ride if he can’t even finish lobs. He’s  already a negative on defense, and nothing more than a body on offense if he can’t catch lobs Ike he used to"
8973,2020-12-15 02:31:46,kcr5i2,This is what I like to see
8974,2020-12-15 02:31:50,kcr5i2,"Uh oh, they are back"
8975,2020-12-15 02:31:58,kcr5i2,Thj with a shot to the nuts lmao
8976,2020-12-15 02:32:19,kcr5i2,"Ok, looks like Luka heard our criticism and is off to a better start in the 2nd half."
8977,2020-12-15 02:32:41,kcr5i2,Hey MFFLs is it okay if I post a comment that's not a wild overreaction after one and a half preseason games? Okay cool. Here goes. This fake fan noise is annoying af right??
8978,2020-12-15 02:32:55,kcr5i2,Powell pls keep rolling
8979,2020-12-15 02:38:06,kcr5i2,What a messy game for both teams lol
8980,2020-12-15 02:38:38,kcr5i2,Bucks commentator suckssssssss
8981,2020-12-15 02:46:04,kcr5i2,"I know folks wanna see us win this preseason game, but Im glad Powell is getting good minutes. We are going to need him"
8982,2020-12-15 02:46:56,kcr5i2,How do their announcers not know any of our correct players names?!??!
8983,2020-12-15 02:47:20,kcr5i2,I hope we see the rookies the whole 4th quarter
8984,2020-12-15 02:50:36,kcr5i2,"I love Luka, man. I know his complaining gets annoying but damn if he doesn’t get pissed off."
8985,2020-12-15 02:51:17,kcr5i2,Luka heating up
8986,2020-12-15 02:51:32,kcr5i2,We are so lucky to have Luka
8987,2020-12-15 02:52:06,kcr5i2,J Rich my fucking man
8988,2020-12-15 02:53:41,kcr5i2,If Rick benches the starters at the 4th we might have revolt in our hands lol
8989,2020-12-15 02:54:14,kcr5i2,"Doubters, Luka has 27 points, 8 rebounds and 4 assists... Is that bad?"
8990,2020-12-15 02:54:30,kcr5i2,"The Bucks commentators actually raise a good point. Why is Doncic listed as a shooting guard when he's practically the point guard for this team, especially with the shift to more positionless basketball (or at least just guards and forwards)"
8991,2020-12-15 02:54:39,kcr5i2,Why has Rick played the starters for the entire quarter?
8992,2020-12-15 02:55:03,kcr5i2,The bench is UP LMAO
8993,2020-12-15 02:55:46,kcr5i2,"Portis, the new Mavs killer lol"
8994,2020-12-15 02:55:50,kcr5i2,swear to god you can hear everything tim yells.
8995,2020-12-15 02:57:57,kcr5i2,I forgot this was a preseason game I'm loving the intensity
8996,2020-12-15 02:58:48,kcr5i2,Bruh Josh
8997,2020-12-15 03:02:07,kcr5i2,JRich is bout to be Just Rich after this season if he keeps shooting like this.
8998,2020-12-15 03:02:35,kcr5i2,What a circus shot by Jalen lmao
8999,2020-12-15 03:02:46,kcr5i2,we got the giannis stopper in finally
9000,2020-12-15 03:03:09,kcr5i2,Lets go Mavs!!
9001,2020-12-15 03:03:52,kcr5i2,Man jb :(
9002,2020-12-15 03:04:05,kcr5i2,"killer b’s making their presence known, let’s go!"
9003,2020-12-15 03:04:14,kcr5i2,Kill them off JB!!
9004,2020-12-15 03:05:18,kcr5i2,We got allen iverson
9005,2020-12-15 03:05:21,kcr5i2,Gotta give it to the little guys
9006,2020-12-15 03:06:04,kcr5i2,giannis is a glitch
9007,2020-12-15 03:07:06,kcr5i2,Giannis this team would cover all your flaws 😭
9008,2020-12-15 03:07:14,kcr5i2,we 19/45 from 3s god damn. 47%
9009,2020-12-15 03:07:27,kcr5i2,It feels so good having the Bench Mob led by Brunson Burner back
9010,2020-12-15 03:07:30,kcr5i2,I don't think Giannis is gonna stay with Milwaukee. He doesn't look happy with the Bucks. He needs a change of scenery. Miami and Dallas could be favorites.
9011,2020-12-15 03:07:40,kcr5i2,WCS with the pick and pop
9012,2020-12-15 03:08:18,kcr5i2,I hope Brunson can be our CJ McCollum. Giving me some serious CJ vibe when he plays.
9013,2020-12-15 03:08:27,kcr5i2,[deleted]
9014,2020-12-15 03:09:25,kcr5i2,oh boy i'm so hype for this season
9015,2020-12-15 03:09:57,kcr5i2,James Johnson has a chance to be a really positive influence on WCS. Love to see him bring the dog out in Willy
9016,2020-12-15 03:11:47,kcr5i2,Yeah man can shoot
9017,2020-12-15 03:11:51,kcr5i2,OMFG!!!!!!
9018,2020-12-15 03:12:01,kcr5i2,Hell yeah!!
9019,2020-12-15 03:12:35,kcr5i2,Those gray warmups and black shooting shirts are so niiiiiice
9020,2020-12-15 03:12:40,kcr5i2,Oh yeah the confidence of this team is through the ozone layer
9021,2020-12-15 03:13:29,kcr5i2,What an oop by Trey to Willie!!
9022,2020-12-15 03:14:27,kcr5i2,IM BITING MY FINGER I CANT SCREAM IN 6PM MORNINGGG
9023,2020-12-15 03:14:57,kcr5i2,Willie I see you
9024,2020-12-15 03:15:31,kcr5i2,I’m in love with this team. So talented and so much chemistry.
9025,2020-12-15 03:15:36,kcr5i2,I’m so geeked up about a preseason game omg
9026,2020-12-15 03:15:47,kcr5i2,Holy MOTHER OF DIRK
9027,2020-12-15 03:16:17,kcr5i2,"Oh God, Walmart Luka is in the game"
9028,2020-12-15 03:16:53,kcr5i2,Terry time
9029,2020-12-15 03:17:37,kcr5i2,Time for Bobi and Sons
9030,2020-12-15 03:18:30,kcr5i2,Our Wings are amazing.
9031,2020-12-15 03:19:25,kcr5i2,haha .. Boban .. I'm dead
9032,2020-12-15 03:22:10,kcr5i2,Bobi is automatic
9033,2020-12-15 03:23:28,kcr5i2,Love this Team!!!
9034,2020-12-15 02:08:28,kcr5i2,Powell would’ve dunked that shit before the injury. That lob is a great example of what the Achilles tear takes away.
9035,2020-12-15 02:01:39,kcr5i2,The confidence of THJ can be the most beautiful and the most damning thing to watch.
9036,2020-12-15 02:10:49,kcr5i2,"Regardless of the improvements to the support cast, this team will only go as far as Luka goes."
9037,2020-12-15 02:16:41,kcr5i2,"I remember last year people started complaining and worrying after a bad 1st quarter of the 1st game. I really thought we would give it a few games into the regular season this year before these doom and gloom comments came up again, but I guess I was wrong lol."
9038,2020-12-15 01:54:17,kcr5i2,[deleted]
9039,2020-12-15 02:04:59,kcr5i2,Luka doesn’t look good rn tbh
9040,2020-12-15 02:08:12,kcr5i2,"Jesus Christ, Luka with awful decision making on his shots. What the hell is wrong with him?"
9041,2020-12-15 02:35:08,kcr5i2,"Was not watching and went directly to see this sub.  Thought mavs were down 80 by the toxicity here. We really about to trade powell, fire rick, luka a bust because we were down 10 points to one of the best teams with one of the best players in the league ... on a pre season game."
9042,2020-12-14 06:36:14,kcr5i2,Maxi about to clamp giannis
9043,2020-12-15 02:21:59,kcr5i2,"I think you guys are overeacting too much with Luka, he could just be having a bad game."
9044,2020-12-15 02:38:57,kcr5i2,"Ah yes, the Giannis' signiture move, running thru the defender like a buldozer"
9045,2020-12-15 02:52:17,kcr5i2,Some of y’all need to realize no one cares about your shitty overreactions and opinions
9046,2020-12-15 02:14:20,kcr5i2,Nah powell is plain unplayable. I can totaly see a ruined season from rick overforcing thr love of his life at any price
9047,2020-12-15 02:04:46,kcr5i2,Luka with another airball. He has no lift because of his conditioning issues...
9048,2020-12-14 23:22:17,kcr5i2,TIL Luka and Rondo have the same agent.
9049,2020-12-15 00:43:12,kcr5i2,If anyone wanted to message me a site I could hypothetically stream the game on that would be great. Cheers!
9050,2020-12-15 01:06:26,kcr5i2, nate hinton exclusive interview? they love him in dallas
9051,2020-12-15 01:11:57,kcr5i2,Luka doesn't look as pudgy without the shirt
9052,2020-12-15 01:15:43,kcr5i2,Playtime is over.  Send in Boban.
9053,2020-12-15 01:15:45,kcr5i2,JRich is going to be what we hoped Delon would be
9054,2020-12-15 01:18:42,kcr5i2,Luka already on the ref's ass lol
9055,2020-12-15 01:20:04,kcr5i2,Why the fuck do I pay for League Pass when it won’t play the only stream I want.
9056,2020-12-15 01:20:10,kcr5i2,People are saying luka is slow coz he’s fat lmaoooo he clearly doesn’t care he’s playing like its an all star game
9057,2020-12-15 01:23:05,kcr5i2,"I’m not gonna tell anybody how to feel about Luka but like, it’s pre season guys. Just don’t put too much stock into things"
9058,2020-12-15 01:26:04,kcr5i2,Did Skin just call Doncic the MVP in the 2nd game of preseason?
9059,2020-12-15 01:28:05,kcr5i2,He didn’t call bank. Doesn’t count
9060,2020-12-15 01:28:38,kcr5i2,ok the fts are not promising lol
9061,2020-12-15 01:28:55,kcr5i2,Has luka only been practicing threes? What are those free throws my man
9062,2020-12-15 01:30:24,kcr5i2,Kleb3r is back
9063,2020-12-15 01:30:26,kcr5i2,I'm glad Kleber's shot is back
9064,2020-12-15 01:31:39,kcr5i2,Giannis must have the ugliest ft form ever lmao
9065,2020-12-15 01:32:30,kcr5i2,maxi making all the 3s he missed in the bubble!
9066,2020-12-15 01:33:04,kcr5i2,We are lookin goooood
9067,2020-12-15 01:33:14,kcr5i2,kl3b3r
9068,2020-12-15 01:33:35,kcr5i2,I'm glad this thread is more active!
9069,2020-12-15 01:34:33,kcr5i2,"I really hope I was wrong about Josh and he shoots close to 40% from 3.

When he has confidence in his shot and doesnt hesitate it looks a lot better"
9070,2020-12-15 01:35:50,kcr5i2,J rich bru
9071,2020-12-15 01:36:54,kcr5i2,"This ball movement so far has been beautiful. Richardson is active on both ends, small sample size so far but he looks like he could be a real staple in the franchise. I don’t wanna say 3rd star but he’s definitely a solid starter."
9072,2020-12-15 01:36:58,kcr5i2,Luka's stroke is nice.
9073,2020-12-15 01:38:42,kcr5i2,"J Rich 😬😬😬😬 

He’s ready for a breakout next to Luka"
9074,2020-12-15 01:39:00,kcr5i2,Was JRichs gum in a DVD locking case?  Lol
9075,2020-12-15 01:39:31,kcr5i2,JOSH GREEN!!
9076,2020-12-15 01:40:14,kcr5i2,JALEN YOU LEGEND!
9077,2020-12-15 01:42:29,kcr5i2,Hack a Giannis is working well
9078,2020-12-15 01:46:44,kcr5i2,When Brunson and Burke are playing it feels like the Detroit team that won the championship.
9079,2020-12-15 01:47:06,kcr5i2,Man! I'm just happy JB is back
9080,2020-12-15 01:47:55,kcr5i2,Wow I can’t believe Dirk is back and 27 years old
9081,2020-12-15 01:51:34,kcr5i2,I think Maxi’s shooting is related to how much defensive burden he have
9082,2020-12-15 01:52:50,kcr5i2,What did we do to you Middleton??
9083,2020-12-15 01:53:20,kcr5i2,"Dont like the offense with burke and brunson running it at all. Both are forcing a ton of hard midrange shots, we are getting no open looks at all"
9084,2020-12-15 01:53:58,kcr5i2,Giannis had his eyes on the ball the entire time Johnson was bringing it up haha
9085,2020-12-15 01:53:59,kcr5i2,Did Powell just try to guard Giannis behind 2 other guys?
9086,2020-12-15 01:58:55,kcr5i2,That was a clean block.
9087,2020-12-15 01:59:23,kcr5i2,[deleted]
9088,2020-12-15 02:04:23,kcr5i2,Luka is getting nothing on these floaters
9089,2020-12-15 02:04:28,kcr5i2,"Okay, Luka is officially too cold for my liking..."
9090,2020-12-15 02:14:12,kcr5i2,let’s go Timmy
9091,2020-12-15 02:14:14,kcr5i2,We need rim protection please
9092,2020-12-15 02:16:29,kcr5i2,how are you guys watching this game? I can't find FSSW anywhere
9093,2020-12-15 02:17:42,kcr5i2,How is Bobby Portis managing to FEAST on us every single time? Should swap maxi and Johnson matchups let maxi take giannis and Johnson take portis
9094,2020-12-15 02:27:06,kcr5i2,"What does Powell actually offer anymore, I feel for the guy he had a terrible injury and of course it’s hard to come back, but I don’t see what he brings to the table"
9095,2020-12-15 02:31:54,kcr5i2,That's more like it...
9096,2020-12-15 02:32:29,kcr5i2,Mavs are the best 3quarter team DONT @ me.
9097,2020-12-15 02:36:25,kcr5i2,Balls dont lie
9098,2020-12-15 02:39:40,kcr5i2,"Trust me, if it’s a close game and Rick gets the starters go you’ll see everything is fine with Luka’s speed and movement."
9099,2020-12-15 02:39:50,kcr5i2,Cmon Giannis come join mavs! You can barerly compete with this team
9100,2020-12-15 02:44:36,kcr5i2,Luka lol
9101,2020-12-15 02:45:01,kcr5i2,Ill let that heatcheck slide
9102,2020-12-15 02:46:18,kcr5i2,Jrue playing D like it’s the playoffs 😳
9103,2020-12-15 02:47:53,kcr5i2,"Speaking of evaluating, FSNSW needs to fire Skin asap. Harper can go too. Followill is the only reason I don’t mute these games.

(Still better than the Rangers broadcast team)"
9104,2020-12-15 02:47:58,kcr5i2,Richardson is a PLAYMAKER
9105,2020-12-15 02:47:59,kcr5i2,Ngl the officiating has been horrible
9106,2020-12-15 02:50:35,kcr5i2,AND ONEEEEEE
9107,2020-12-15 02:51:24,kcr5i2,Luka read this thread during halftime
9108,2020-12-15 02:51:35,kcr5i2,"Yeah, i think luka will be just fine lol. You can just see when he decides to turn it up"
9109,2020-12-15 02:52:10,kcr5i2,JRich is a sniper
9110,2020-12-15 02:52:13,kcr5i2,Jesus Christ Josh. What the hell is going on?!
9111,2020-12-15 02:52:30,kcr5i2,Josh Richardson is Legit AF 💯
9112,2020-12-15 02:52:32,kcr5i2,Do not leave J-Rich open
9113,2020-12-15 02:54:09,kcr5i2,Is 4 years old too young for a first jersey or should I wait till next Christmas to give my son a 77?
9114,2020-12-15 02:54:28,kcr5i2,WE ARE A THIRD QUARTER TEAM!! LOL
9115,2020-12-15 02:54:39,kcr5i2,"I do find it funny as much as myself and others have questioned Luka’s physical fitness, he still has a stupid stat line in like 28 mins against the best defense"
9116,2020-12-15 02:56:36,kcr5i2,These refs...
9117,2020-12-15 02:57:40,kcr5i2,I’m excited for the Bucks to learn the disappointment that comes with having Portis on your team. Maybe he’ll punch another Euro this time and that euro will leave the team for warmer climates.
9118,2020-12-15 02:58:03,kcr5i2,This game is so enjoyable!!
9119,2020-12-15 03:01:10,kcr5i2,As far as I'm concerned Mavs took the dub this game who cares what happens benchwarmers vs benchwarmers
9120,2020-12-15 03:01:25,kcr5i2,I see james johnson is in
9121,2020-12-15 03:02:05,kcr5i2,Bud still playing the starters??
9122,2020-12-15 03:02:17,kcr5i2,and that's why Giannis struggles in POs
9123,2020-12-15 03:02:56,kcr5i2,JB playing street ball
9124,2020-12-15 03:03:23,kcr5i2,lmao at Giannis tryng to run thru Maxi
9125,2020-12-15 03:04:01,kcr5i2,"There goes our bench exposing the Bucks starters, LETS GO!"
9126,2020-12-15 03:04:07,kcr5i2,Jesus JB!
9127,2020-12-15 03:04:23,kcr5i2,Oh yeah JB!
9128,2020-12-15 03:05:11,kcr5i2,Brunson deserved the and1 there.

9131,2020-12-15 03:08:13,kcr5i2,"""groundskeeper"" Willie"
9132,2020-12-15 03:08:15,kcr5i2,"The defense ALREADY looks much better, will be interesting how much it can improve from here."
9133,2020-12-15 03:08:47,kcr5i2,Kleiber has quick draw on hall of fame
9134,2020-12-15 03:10:01,kcr5i2,"If Giannis wants to shoot mid rangers, I know a couple of German fellas who could help him work on that."
9135,2020-12-15 03:11:20,kcr5i2,This fake crowd noise is creepy
9136,2020-12-15 03:12:13,kcr5i2,"Man, if Tyler Bey's hair was a little shorter he could be Matrix's doppleganger."
9137,2020-12-15 03:13:19,kcr5i2,Hope willy gets some more minutes this season
9138,2020-12-15 03:13:22,kcr5i2,Willie looks legit
9139,2020-12-15 03:13:23,kcr5i2,WCS splashing - really looks like he should be the starter rn
9140,2020-12-15 03:14:04,kcr5i2,🔥🔥🔥🔥
9141,2020-12-15 03:15:48,kcr5i2,This team is passion and I love it!
9142,2020-12-15 03:19:22,kcr5i2,Terry's has is so bouncy
9143,2020-12-15 03:30:18,kcr5i2,"Kids, this is why we don't overreact lol"

9146,2020-12-15 02:16:48,kcr5i2,"Until Luka can confidently take his clothes off, look down, and be able to see his own dick, he ain’t winning the MVP"
9147,2020-12-15 02:18:25,kcr5i2,That 10 lbs of weight is the difference of consistently getting to the basket with Luka. He's getting locked up on his drives
9148,2020-12-15 01:57:24,kcr5i2,Dallas has no good defenders at Center
9149,2020-12-15 02:04:32,kcr5i2,I know it’s pre season but that Luka play was more like a slow break.
9150,2020-12-15 02:08:08,kcr5i2,Still missing freebies. Pretty inexcusable now
9151,2020-12-15 02:45:03,kcr5i2,"Lmao they are making a whole deal abiut giannis' ""improved"" ft shooting when man is like 1/7 from the line 😂😂😂"
9152,2020-12-15 02:48:53,kcr5i2,It is actualy insane how luka still gets disrespected like thus
9153,2020-12-15 03:05:59,kcr5i2,"So that Powell contract is going to be an albatross isn't it? We have him locked up at 11mil per for 2 more years after this. His defense is killing the team so far. I know it's early, but an achilles tear is so devastating to a player like him."
9154,2020-12-15 02:05:52,kcr5i2,Year 3 - Luka still has no touch on that floater
9155,2020-12-15 02:10:18,kcr5i2,Don’t wanna exaggerate but Luka looks horrible
9156,2020-12-15 02:20:52,kcr5i2,"People acting like Luka being out of shape isn't a big deal are delusional. Obviously, it's affecting his game. He will work himself into shape but I really hope this isn't a trend every year."
9157,2020-12-14 15:04:46,kcr5i2,"If Luka ever drops 40 on Rui & the Wizards, it will be the second time a Fat Man has devasted Japanese folks"
9158,2020-12-15 01:27:44,kcr5i2,We have no rim protection. Get Maxi or WCS pls
9159,2020-12-15 01:28:47,kcr5i2,"As much as it’s preseason, Powell looks rough. Feels like he is missing bounce."
9160,2020-12-15 02:06:14,kcr5i2,They need to run the Cleveland Baseball Team drill to get Luka some cardio.
9161,2020-12-15 02:14:04,kcr5i2,luka having a bad bad bad game
9162,2020-12-15 02:14:15,kcr5i2,Looks like our improved D did not show up today.
9163,2020-12-15 02:44:09,kcr5i2,The Bucks commentators are terrible and they're barely even giving live commentary on the game
9164,2020-12-15 02:45:02,kcr5i2,I mean if we're being honest we're competing nicely with the Bucks full roster and we're missing our 7'3 21 PPG scorer who is an elite rim protector
9165,2020-12-15 03:10:01,kcr5i2,"Get Giannis off this fraudulent ass Bucks team already. Yes I know this is preseason, yes, I do think we are this much better than the Bucks."
9166,2020-12-14 21:18:49,kcr5i2,"I love the fact that everyone in this thread knows what's best for Luka's game and fitness, even though Luka has been playing this game since he was a fetus.......   hes young... when you are young you can eat like crap, then work it off fairly quickly. 

Get back to me In 2- 3 years when his body cant do that anymore before we start staging an Intervention...."
9167,2020-12-15 02:15:36,kcr5i2,If im Luka I pretend this game never happend and work myself into opening night
9168,2020-12-15 02:19:13,kcr5i2,Looking pretty shit against bucks 2nd unit atm not great signs
9169,2020-12-15 02:21:36,kcr5i2,If only Luka could shoot FTs
9170,2020-12-15 02:58:36,kcr5i2,We blamed our fans for overreaction but look at Luka... its a stupid preseason game man calm down
9171,2020-12-15 02:22:27,kcr5i2,"Luka looks like he is out of shape or maybe he is not even trying too hard. His drives are not as agressive as they are used to be. There were reports that he was training with the Slovenian NT so i hope he is just playing carefully and does not want to risk injury.
Powell lost his bounce, he jumps too slow and Richardson can't miss wide open shots although he sets his feet slowly and his release is also weird and slow but he is our best player so far and a pleasent surprise.
Johnson also looks like a great addition but i think he is out of shape right now.
Kleber and DFS look ready for the season meanwhile Brunson and THJ are not there yet."
9172,2020-12-15 02:15:13,kcr5i2,I'm afraid this yr for luka will look more like his rookie year where he was gassed towards the end of the season
9173,2020-12-15 01:02:41,kcr5i2,Harp’s suit is great tonight.
9174,2020-12-15 01:04:22,kcr5i2,I wish you could cast rocked cocaine small rivers from your phone to the tv. Its choppy as hell trying to run through my prime stick.

9176,2020-12-15 01:14:42,kcr5i2,"I don't really care now because it's preseason and I don't really mind starter Dwight, but during the season I hope Rick makes proper adjustments because of all people who can't defend Giannis, Dwight can't defend him the most"
9177,2020-12-15 01:14:51,kcr5i2,"Giannis for 3


BRICK LOL"
9178,2020-12-15 01:19:13,kcr5i2,LOL THJ: “(undistinguishable) FUCK”
9179,2020-12-15 01:19:44,kcr5i2,"I’m not liking Powell, THJ, and I’m a bit worried bout luka"
9180,2020-12-15 01:20:12,kcr5i2,Ugly quarter
9181,2020-12-15 01:20:38,kcr5i2,The two starts prove that Powell should not be the starter. The lack of spacing hurts everyone trying to drive especially Luka who was the best finisher at the rim last season but is currently having to chuck mid range jumpers cuz Powell is clogging the paint.
9182,2020-12-15 01:21:12,kcr5i2,Jesus christ both teams are rusty as fuck
9183,2020-12-15 01:21:36,kcr5i2,"Great effort on the tip out by DFS earlier. 

Dwight looks slow but so do Holiday and Giannis. Boys have been lifting a lot in the off season. Now it’s time to get in *game* shape."
9184,2020-12-15 01:22:10,kcr5i2,López better knot be fronting my boy doe doe
9185,2020-12-15 01:22:17,kcr5i2,"Luka said ""I got proper secondary ball-handler and a healthy back-up this year, I ain't even bothering for these scrimmages"""

9187,2020-12-15 01:24:33,kcr5i2,"so, dwight still looking quuick"
9188,2020-12-15 01:26:40,kcr5i2,Luka is really ramping up now
9189,2020-12-15 01:29:03,kcr5i2,"Oh yeah, really worked on that shooting Luka"
9190,2020-12-15 01:30:54,kcr5i2,Seeing Giannis take FTs makes me feel better about Lukas lol

9193,2020-12-15 01:37:36,kcr5i2,"Bucks announcers did their homework, really fine explanation on Richardson signing."
9194,2020-12-15 01:38:48,kcr5i2,"lukas move to the left and stepback has to be his signature, so clean"
9195,2020-12-15 01:39:14,kcr5i2,some bullshit calls
9196,2020-12-15 01:46:59,kcr5i2,great D by johnson
9197,2020-12-15 01:48:32,kcr5i2,Burke is playing terrible tho. On both sides but expecialy on defense he looks straight up unplayable
9198,2020-12-15 01:51:51,kcr5i2,"Nice ""new things"" guys. Niiiice.... 👍😁"
9199,2020-12-15 01:55:24,kcr5i2,What is Up with all these bricks and airballs
9200,2020-12-15 01:59:15,kcr5i2,I hope the Mavs find a way to trade Dwight Powell. I don’t care how great of a guy he is.
9201,2020-12-15 02:00:46,kcr5i2,Okay THJ!
9202,2020-12-15 02:04:25,kcr5i2,Luka...
9203,2020-12-15 02:09:43,kcr5i2,Our offense gets really frenzied sometimes.
9204,2020-12-15 02:16:21,kcr5i2,"Holiday is playing good D on Luka, give him props"
9205,2020-12-15 02:16:23,kcr5i2,Oh dear we look out of ideas creatively offence. Hopefully it’s just ring rust. On the bright side j rich looks good
9206,2020-12-15 02:16:26,kcr5i2,"Well defense lools much more what we are used to, this time around"
9207,2020-12-15 02:29:44,kcr5i2,OKay lob is Back!!!
9208,2020-12-15 02:31:57,kcr5i2,There we go
9209,2020-12-15 02:33:24,kcr5i2,Without KP teams can just clog the paint and luka cant operate below
9210,2020-12-15 02:37:00,kcr5i2,wait what how did we get a tech
9211,2020-12-15 02:40:40,kcr5i2,They should change their name to the Milwaukee Trucks
9212,2020-12-15 02:41:15,kcr5i2,When are we gonna see the rookies
9213,2020-12-15 02:46:37,kcr5i2,Please put powell out of his misery
9214,2020-12-15 02:46:39,kcr5i2,They do know this game doesn't count right?

9217,2020-12-15 02:49:27,kcr5i2,Same spot as the game winner.
9218,2020-12-15 02:49:37,kcr5i2,That was an angry step back 3 yeahh
9219,2020-12-15 02:50:15,kcr5i2,Good to see hardaway hitting some shots

9221,2020-12-15 02:57:51,kcr5i2,Angry Luka is so damn good.
9222,2020-12-15 03:02:01,kcr5i2,If only JRich was a second quicker
9223,2020-12-15 03:02:25,kcr5i2,JALEN FUCKING BRUNSON
9224,2020-12-15 03:02:25,kcr5i2,There's that offensive foul that supposedly frustrates Giannis
9225,2020-12-15 03:02:30,kcr5i2,damn i see you JB.
9226,2020-12-15 03:02:35,kcr5i2,Lmao Giannis playing in the 4th. Budenholzer wants to win today
9227,2020-12-15 03:02:39,kcr5i2,Curb your offensive foul
9228,2020-12-15 03:02:43,kcr5i2,I wish Green would just pull up. Does not seem confident in his 3 right now.
9229,2020-12-15 03:02:49,kcr5i2,I mean maxi is just giannis' daddy at this point 😂😂
9230,2020-12-15 03:02:54,kcr5i2,Yes yes maxi... Make him more annoyed hehehe
9231,2020-12-15 03:03:30,kcr5i2,"This Burke, Brunson, Green, Maxi, WCS might be our best bench lineup. WCS over James Johnson."
9232,2020-12-15 03:05:42,kcr5i2,Wtf Giannis lmao
9233,2020-12-15 03:07:07,kcr5i2,His in game motion has a lot more hitch than his workout vids.
9234,2020-12-15 03:08:24,kcr5i2,JALEN BRUNSON IS THE MAN! WHAT A PRESEASON GAME!
9235,2020-12-15 03:08:40,kcr5i2,"Wooooooooooo

Let's goooooooooo"
9236,2020-12-15 03:08:52,kcr5i2,I really wanna see what it looks like in training camp in a scrimmage. Starters vs 2nd unit
9237,2020-12-15 03:14:00,kcr5i2,BENCH MOB
9238,2020-12-15 03:15:33,kcr5i2,NATE HINTON TIME
9239,2020-12-15 03:18:29,kcr5i2,Terry cooked him but wasn't confident enough to pull the 3 with the separation he created.
9240,2020-12-15 03:19:58,kcr5i2,Big daddy Boban
9241,2020-12-15 03:20:08,kcr5i2,okay tyrell!
9242,2020-12-15 03:20:18,kcr5i2,Bobi is a cheat code
9243,2020-12-15 03:20:23,kcr5i2,Boban is in as their bailout option
9244,2020-12-15 03:31:05,kcr5i2,"I know it’s early guys, but the Mavs are built similar to the Heat in my eyes"
9245,2020-12-15 01:13:24,kcr5i2,Powell sucks
9246,2020-12-15 02:14:28,kcr5i2,"Hi, Luka fan here but I havent been following Mavs since the post season. How has Luka been? I heard some people say he is out of shape. Is there truth in this? I am hoping he takes the MVP this year"
9247,2020-12-15 02:22:24,kcr5i2,What did Dwight Powell work on after he was out for so long? Did he not hit the weight room cause he continues to get bullied. His shot is still the same. He’s just a soft big man. He looks like he is trying too hard. Can’t wait till kp comes back.
9248,2020-12-14 16:48:00,kcr5i2,"I hope they start WCS over Dwight. I know the game doesn’t really matter, but the defense suffers with Powell as our rim protector. He’s an outstanding lob threat but I don’t think it’s worth sacrificing defense for it."
9249,2020-12-14 19:32:20,kcr5i2,"> LuKa FaT

It's not America's Next Top Model ffs..."
9250,2020-12-15 01:16:15,kcr5i2,Luka just looks heavy and slow right now lol
9251,2020-12-15 01:42:29,kcr5i2,Are we allowed to post streams? You can choose either broadcast on this one (top left corner). http://sportinglive.co/nba-15-milwaukee-bucks-vs-dallas-mavericks/
9252,2020-12-15 01:54:47,kcr5i2,Damn. Offense in shitter again
9253,2020-12-15 01:55:00,kcr5i2,Does anyone have a link to working FSSW stream? These Bucks announcers suck
9254,2020-12-15 02:06:48,kcr5i2,Wonder if the clips would have taken powell in a sign and trade for harrell
9255,2020-12-15 02:15:46,kcr5i2,Luka just kinda looks lost. Maybe it's fatigue related but they are also one of the best defensive teams. Still should look better though
9256,2020-12-15 02:16:56,kcr5i2,"Man Lu looking bad lol

&#x200B;

The gamer diet needs to stop bro!"
9257,2020-12-15 02:17:05,kcr5i2,"Luka will obviously have a great season, but it seems like maybe he hasn’t put in as much off season work as I hoped"
9258,2020-12-15 02:30:01,kcr5i2,Powell should not take 3s.
9259,2020-12-15 02:35:12,kcr5i2,Whats powell bitching about
9260,2020-12-15 02:40:25,kcr5i2,"Man why are y’all actin like this is game 2 of the NBA Finals?

Just enjoy the damn game"
9261,2020-12-15 02:58:19,kcr5i2,Has powell finished an alley oop yet this pre season? I know he's gotten fouled a couple times but cant remember seeing him actually finish one.
9262,2020-12-15 03:03:24,kcr5i2,"this girl ref sucks guys... she’s missed so many calls on our guys

edit: finally got a call"
9263,2020-12-15 01:18:43,kcr5i2,People who said Luka's extra weight won't affect them can shut up now. He has issues with getting past guys that he would fly by last season
9264,2020-12-15 02:15:07,kcr5i2,Luka ain’t did shit during the off-season lol
9265,2020-12-15 02:15:47,kcr5i2,same last year. TRADE POWELL
9266,2020-12-15 02:30:11,kcr5i2,Powell = trash
9267,2020-12-14 05:15:40,kcr5i2,[deleted]
9268,2020-12-15 02:29:10,kcr5i2,Finished watching the Pelicans game and not gonna lie its pretty jarring seeing how good shape Zion is in now and how much he dominated the Heat
9269,2020-12-15 02:20:02,kcr5i2,Luka just looks sloppy and almost clueless out there. I expected more from him. I know it's preseason but all the other top stars in the league are balling out in their games.
9270,2020-12-15 02:17:14,kcr5i2,I need to keep reminding myself how much better we will be once KP is back
9271,2020-12-15 02:40:02,kcr5i2,"Richardson is fire, tho he will take away rebounds she /and triple doubles from Luka"
9272,2020-12-15 01:14:19,kcr5i2,"Get Powell off the fucking court what is this shitty offense? 

“But mah offensive rating alley oop plus minus +137495829“ 

FOH"
9273,2020-12-14 10:36:44,kcr5i2,Someone should break into Luka's home and steal all the food.
9274,2020-12-14 15:42:30,kcr5i2,Prediction: Chubby Luka comes out on fire to start the season then cools off as he gets into better shape.
9275,2020-12-15 03:20:53,kcr5i2,Something tells me Terry has a huge ego
9276,2020-12-15 02:15:09,kcr5i2,"luka bby, chosen one, wut r u doin"
9277,2020-12-15 02:46:50,kcr5i2,Why do some Mavs fans dislike DFS?
9278,2020-12-15 02:07:32,kcr5i2,"Luka wtf, he's been awful this game, can't even hit FTs"
9279,2020-12-15 02:38:01,kcr5i2,Powell needs put a shiver in Giannis’ ribs
9280,2020-12-15 02:31:23,kcr5i2,Wonder if Luka had covid. That bloated / red face looks like what my buddy looked like after.
9281,2020-12-15 03:20:24,kcr5i2,u/mavman212 was trying to tell me Terry isn’t undersized 🤣🤣
9282,2020-12-15 02:12:51,kcr5i2,Tim looks like straight trash
9283,2020-12-15 02:13:09,kcr5i2,Lol Torrey Craig pressing hard up 10 in a preseason game
9284,2020-12-15 01:59:35,kcr5i2,It looks like Tim is playing with zero confidence
9285,2020-12-15 02:57:32,kcr5i2,Luka is slooowwwwwwww
9286,2020-12-14 11:03:42,kcr5i2,"Maybe Giannis could get Luka bulked and ripped, that would be the best timeline"
9287,2020-12-14 06:35:25,kcr5i2,"I believe they talked it out, it was an accident and they became instant friends"
9288,2020-12-14 06:47:59,kcr5i2,Maybe he liked it. He has said he like old school style and doesn't like being friendly with other players during the season.
9289,2020-12-15 02:07:45,kcr5i2,Trade Luka now while he still has value
9290,2020-12-15 02:07:11,kcr5i2,Welcome to reddit
9291,2020-12-15 02:07:03,kcr5i2,And against the Bucks of all teams
9292,2020-12-15 02:15:39,kcr5i2,FIRE RICK!!!!
9293,2020-12-15 03:14:56,kcr5i2,League aint ready
9294,2020-12-15 03:26:06,kcr5i2,And Porzingis LOVES destroying the bucks. It could've been a worse blowout.
9295,2020-12-15 03:24:44,kcr5i2,And it is not like it was really close. Plus all starters played decent minutes for bucks as well (not regular season minutes but neither did our starters). Looks promising.
9296,2020-12-15 03:26:44,kcr5i2,Bobi Daycare Hour
9297,2020-12-15 03:28:45,kcr5i2,"I love the chemistry in the Bobi and his kids squad.    

Tyrel Terry: Shy pass to Bobi  👉👈 

Bobi:  😃  👍"
9298,2020-12-15 02:54:03,kcr5i2,ay brother
9299,2020-12-15 03:15:05,kcr5i2,I already busted in the 3rd :/
9300,2020-12-15 02:59:24,kcr5i2, 🤝
9301,2020-12-15 03:01:10,kcr5i2,Ohhhweee I’m gonna go take a look.
9302,2020-12-15 03:24:45,kcr5i2,They're still suppppperrr raw. Not expecting much from this season. Just puts in perspective the type of player Luka is...
9303,2020-12-15 01:35:32,kcr5i2,totally agree. Powell and Brunson also had a great P&R thing going Brunson's rookie year that worked damn good against second units (but wasn't quite up to prime time). feel like we should bring that back
9304,2020-12-15 01:35:23,kcr5i2,Amen!
9305,2020-12-15 01:36:05,kcr5i2,No fucking shit anyone saying DP > Maxi are casuals
9306,2020-12-15 02:17:21,kcr5i2,Ye and people act like it’s the finale or something haha. But what can you expect from reddit to be honest.
9307,2020-12-15 03:02:24,kcr5i2,Wow hard to even imagine Porzingis in a Mavs uniform
9308,2020-12-15 03:01:09,kcr5i2,you had me in the first half ngl
9309,2020-12-15 03:07:19,kcr5i2,Perfect mix of offense and defense
9310,2020-12-15 03:09:08,kcr5i2,Its a low key good ass lineup. Brunson and Burke together on paper sounds ehhh... on the floor it looks magical at times
9311,2020-12-15 02:56:16,kcr5i2,"For sure. I love Seth, but I would be okay with this trade even if JRich wasn't absolutely murdering people with these shots"
9312,2020-12-15 02:54:48,kcr5i2,"Let's see what happens during the regular season. 

I honestly think that one is going to be one of the rare win/win trades. We REALLY needed defense and they needed range."
9313,2020-12-15 02:54:16,kcr5i2,"Win/win trade

J-Rich’s defense wasnt needed as much for Philly with Green/Simmons/Thybulle

They desperately needed shooting"
9314,2020-12-15 02:59:51,kcr5i2,Kleber is obviously better than Powell right now but preseason is the best time to help Powell get his rhythm back
9315,2020-12-15 03:13:50,kcr5i2,i really like them honestly
9316,2020-12-15 03:14:49,kcr5i2,"I mean they are right, 0 energy from the Bucks bench"
9317,2020-12-15 03:15:42,kcr5i2,Been done saying this the whole off season check my receipts
9318,2020-12-15 03:25:11,kcr5i2,"I thought that was hilarious. Like, dude, it’s Boban. Leave him alone, he’ll give you the ball when HE wants to."
9319,2020-12-15 01:32:42,kcr5i2,\*lmao @ sixers fans
9320,2020-12-15 01:36:55,kcr5i2,"Dont get too excited yet. He goes through stretches of looking like a shooter.

I hope I’m wrong but this type of game isnt unusual for him"
9321,2020-12-15 01:43:25,kcr5i2,"we got rid of the deadweight on the roster, replaced them with hardworking vets and got back two solid pieces from injury. We looking good boys and that's without the rookies in the picture"
9322,2020-12-15 01:46:52,kcr5i2,His offense too. Just a good player.
9323,2020-12-15 02:33:27,kcr5i2,"Every time he kicks out to DP, I'm like, Kleber would shoot that."
9324,2020-12-15 02:35:01,kcr5i2,At least let WCS get some run
9325,2020-12-15 02:36:27,kcr5i2,"So I get why you say that, but the advantage to bringing Maxi off the bench is his positional versatility.  You start him, you're slotting him right up against the other team's biggest guy.  You bring him off the bench, and he can sub 3-5.

He's more valuable as a bench player."
9326,2020-12-15 03:02:13,kcr5i2,i didn't even notice he was gone but I could feel my blood pressure lower inexplicably
9327,2020-12-15 03:12:27,kcr5i2,He's out here getting reps marking Middleton too.
9328,2020-12-15 03:13:11,kcr5i2,WILLIE TAKING DWIGHTS SPOT RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM
9329,2020-12-15 03:23:21,kcr5i2,Wing depth is a magical thing
9330,2020-12-14 08:30:32,kcr5i2,Impossible. Yoda doesn't speak like that. You imposter
9331,2020-12-14 10:00:56,kcr5i2,"Bullying online won't work against Luka.  


Anybody here knows his address? We can invade his home and scare him."
9332,2020-12-15 02:15:04,kcr5i2,"Thats what this sub does to everything.

They don't understand basketball. If we get down 5 points...it's the end of the world, Rick needs to be fired, and everybody but Luka needs to be traded.

If we're up 10, we're NBA Finals locks. There's no inbetween with this sub"
9333,2020-12-15 02:44:45,kcr5i2,Yep
9334,2020-12-15 02:59:53,kcr5i2,He's gonna be like Tim. He'll have nights like this but it won't be every night
9335,2020-12-15 02:59:46,kcr5i2,Yes
9336,2020-12-15 03:12:56,kcr5i2,Us Aussie fans loving it.
9337,2020-12-15 03:15:23,kcr5i2,"yeah, they’re honestly great"
9338,2020-12-15 03:14:37,kcr5i2,They were so boring last game
9339,2020-12-15 02:06:12,kcr5i2,"I upvoted, but we might reflect on that tomorrow"
9340,2020-12-14 06:45:58,kcr5i2,Over/Under 100 reference to Luka being chubby? I'm gonna go with over.
9341,2020-12-15 03:01:50,kcr5i2,HE'S FREE! Always had all star potential maybe Rick will unlock it this season!
9342,2020-12-15 03:04:16,kcr5i2,Especially considering Seth was only ever good in our system. Every other year on other teams he shot the 3 great but never scored even 8ppg
9343,2020-12-15 03:01:31,kcr5i2,Pray they don't fuck it up for Curry
9344,2020-12-15 03:03:17,kcr5i2,no spacing and they wanted him to mostly be a playmaker
9345,2020-12-15 03:15:27,kcr5i2,Haha what did I say my guy. He’s a shooter
9346,2020-12-15 03:16:46,kcr5i2,WCS james johnson memes
9347,2020-12-15 03:26:43,kcr5i2,"Plus it's really cold in Milwaukee now. He needs to move to a warm area city, like let's say........Dallas for instance...........that would make sense."
9348,2020-12-15 03:30:39,kcr5i2,powell will have no minutes
9349,2020-12-15 01:44:00,kcr5i2,"the most annoying thing about reddit fanbases is everybody getting butthurt when a player they like gets traded, like yeah seth is amazing but use your brain jrich is the PERFECT role player for the mavs"
9350,2020-12-15 01:52:41,kcr5i2,I had no idea how good he was defensively. How did he not crack the Heat’s rotation?
9351,2020-12-15 01:54:58,kcr5i2,"Bucks playing starters, can't expect them to beat Bucks starters too often tbf"
9352,2020-12-15 01:55:30,kcr5i2,"they were great til bucks tied up, then they deflated. gotta put luka back in"
9353,2020-12-15 02:14:54,kcr5i2,no lift
9354,2020-12-15 02:58:37,kcr5i2,It's got to be nice when you've got people who create so much space on the reg for you.
9355,2020-12-15 02:58:52,kcr5i2,Its not even 2 games so the sample size is very small but lets hope he keeps it up.
9356,2020-12-15 03:08:50,kcr5i2,Top offense plus top 10 defense means WCF
9357,2020-12-15 03:07:13,kcr5i2,Giannis really needs an MVP caliber point guard*
9358,2020-12-15 03:08:31,kcr5i2,Possibly my new favorite nickname for anyone ever.
9359,2020-12-15 02:28:17,kcr5i2,"Then why take anything at all from the preseason? It's a look into how the players are doing in terms of conditioning and acclimating to new offenses/defenses. We can see that Luka is out of shape and it is affecting his ability to drive to the bucket - his greatest strength last season. Sure he might be able to play off the weight as the season [progresses, but it's just disappointing to see him like this."
9360,2020-12-15 01:22:53,kcr5i2,That's been the feel with from watching a few different players/teams
9361,2020-12-15 01:25:11,kcr5i2,I feel like it's obvious that he's not playing at full speed rn Yet ppl are saying he got slower??
9362,2020-12-15 01:35:11,kcr5i2,Yep they always fill the paint at all cost but this team is perfect to play against it
9363,2020-12-15 01:58:54,kcr5i2,Powells good with Luka on the floor.
9364,2020-12-15 02:58:12,kcr5i2,His fat ass just carved them up in this quarter
9365,2020-12-15 03:07:30,kcr5i2,Bruh
9366,2020-12-15 01:42:11,kcr5i2,"50 per week, easy."
9367,2020-12-15 02:00:22,kcr5i2,This might not be entirely unrealistic.
9368,2020-12-15 02:11:23,kcr5i2,"Thank you for saying that, you're 100% right. 

Lotta new fans here that haven't been through the ups and downs of a franchise who don't know how good we have it right now"
9369,2020-12-15 02:11:39,kcr5i2,"Long time Mavs fan...Luka and Kristaps brought a Euro element who have tremendously high expectations of both of them and tend to get real negative real fast when they don't meet them.

While Dirk definitely brought some international fans, they weren't generally people who grew up watching them in Euroleague expecting him to dominate every game in the NBA."
9370,2020-12-15 02:08:42,kcr5i2,fr lol dude went from 18 5 5 to 30 9 9 and people are like he's so lazy LOL
9371,2020-12-15 02:08:58,kcr5i2,"Ye, we are one of the worst fanbases"
9372,2020-12-15 02:17:17,kcr5i2,New fans. Our sub grew tremendously the last few seasons and along with that growth came some really toxic fans. That's just how it goes with fanbases
9373,2020-12-15 02:11:07,kcr5i2,[deleted]
9374,2020-12-15 02:08:57,kcr5i2,He's sucked ass so far and came into the preseason out of shape.
9375,2020-12-15 02:12:42,kcr5i2,It would be best for both parties if Luka moves to a different team.
9376,2020-12-15 01:25:29,kcr5i2,Arsenal need him
9377,2020-12-15 02:12:18,kcr5i2,Jesus we can’t finish layups tonight.
9378,2020-12-15 01:39:34,kcr5i2,Lol for real
9379,2020-12-15 01:41:30,kcr5i2,Boban not playing tonight?
9380,2020-12-15 01:49:22,kcr5i2,dudes fucking hauling ass on both ends of the floor during the preseason. Just grinding the little things. Fucking love that shit
9381,2020-12-15 01:51:28,kcr5i2,Subliminal messaging
9382,2020-12-15 02:29:15,kcr5i2,honestly probably worse. WCS basketball IQ is rock bottom
9383,2020-12-15 02:29:08,kcr5i2,WCS isn't very good from what we've seen.
9384,2020-12-15 02:45:15,kcr5i2,The story of most of Luka's 3 point shots
9385,2020-12-15 03:20:17,kcr5i2,Thanks to Donnie
9386,2020-12-15 03:53:32,kcr5i2,"Giannis like ""where is my bench?"""
9387,2020-12-15 02:32:21,kcr5i2,Always has been. Especially in game threads.
9388,2020-12-15 01:36:47,kcr5i2,"bench needs shooting too though perhaps even more. 

Also don't forget KP will be in the starting lineup long term."
9389,2020-12-15 01:37:05,kcr5i2,"Honestly might as well be wcs off the bench. He should be able to do the same with the rolling but is def a better defender. Hope rick dosnt over force powell. If he plays good enough then great if not, make him sit."
9390,2020-12-15 02:08:16,kcr5i2,trying to empathize with giannis
9391,2020-12-15 01:33:08,kcr5i2,Caught that too. Lmao. Their announcers are total trash
9392,2020-12-15 01:35:38,kcr5i2,That was slick af
9393,2020-12-15 01:40:52,kcr5i2,Lethal shooter fits better with Giannis on the court :)
9394,2020-12-15 01:43:07,kcr5i2,Ehhh. One of those was Luka being lazy as hell. One was Burke just fucking up. But I’ll give them a pass because they’re playing with an entirely new second unit. I’m not sure Burke’s played with any of these people. Kleber I guess.
9395,2020-12-15 02:05:59,kcr5i2,The one thing that made him valuable last season was his scoring off pick and rolls. Haven’t seen much of that these first few games. Hopefully he didn’t lose some of that bounce
9396,2020-12-15 02:07:03,kcr5i2,You must be new here lol
9397,2020-12-15 02:37:39,kcr5i2,It's getting annoying at this point.
9398,2020-12-15 02:44:56,kcr5i2,Well at least it's all downhill from there

9400,2020-12-15 03:03:10,kcr5i2,It was our best last season
9401,2020-12-15 03:09:54,kcr5i2,"would probs have to take a pay cut in the 10-15 range for a year, and then when dwight is up, we could extend him correctly. if someone has more cap knowledge, please share"
9402,2020-12-15 03:10:07,kcr5i2,Yes but mark will have to pay luxury tax and he SHOULD for the dynasty
9403,2020-12-15 03:07:59,kcr5i2,Future playoff matchup ;)
9404,2020-12-15 03:07:32,kcr5i2,I think he'll eventually come to the Mavs just so he doesn't have Kleber guarding him anymore
9405,2020-12-15 03:08:13,kcr5i2,He absolutly does. He can do the same as the roller but is a way better defender and if he can shoot then well...it isnt even close.
9406,2020-12-15 03:13:59,kcr5i2,Naw hell throw up those midrangers
9407,2020-12-15 03:09:48,kcr5i2,rick’s system makes anyone who’s willing to take  3’s a shooter
9408,2020-12-15 03:23:26,kcr5i2,JGreen really resembles a not shitty JJax
9409,2020-12-15 01:33:09,kcr5i2,Yeah that was dumb lol
9410,2020-12-15 02:35:47,kcr5i2,That's Mavs basketball.

9419,2020-12-15 01:34:16,kcr5i2,They definitely had an underwhelming offseason. But who knows

9421,2020-12-15 01:33:40,kcr5i2,hes a bum
9422,2020-12-15 02:11:46,kcr5i2,11m a year
9423,2020-12-15 02:20:19,kcr5i2,"For next season maybe. He is not going to travel back in time to take care about his body. 

Looking with hands on knee's during FTs is not going to make his shot any better."
9424,2020-12-15 02:46:37,kcr5i2,"It's gotten worse, I think"
9425,2020-12-15 03:22:57,kcr5i2,Not with jj barea aka lebron killa
9426,2020-12-15 03:22:43,kcr5i2,No
9427,2020-12-14 12:54:02,kcr5i2,"Put him in one of AnaMari's workout program 

https://www.anamaria.co/"
9428,2020-12-14 16:13:34,kcr5i2,its def not 7-10kg. Maaybe 5kg. If Luka lost 10kg it would be very bad.
9429,2020-12-14 05:36:07,kcr5i2,He’ll be alright
9430,2020-12-14 13:29:09,kcr5i2,Zion would be absolutely crucified if he came into this season in the same shape Luka is in
9431,2020-12-14 15:00:12,kcr5i2,"You the same people that said he was a bust? His genes are on the fatter side, but the weight will go off since he is a super active person unlike us couch potatoes."
9432,2020-12-14 17:39:50,kcr5i2,"This. 

Got me thinking I’ll have to sign up for AT&T Now."
9433,2020-12-15 01:10:03,kcr5i2,The mavs stream is broken on league pass look for the bucks stream

9437,2020-12-15 01:31:30,kcr5i2,Idk but It scares me
9438,2020-12-15 01:34:03,kcr5i2,It's a keloid
9439,2020-12-15 01:35:45,kcr5i2,2
9440,2020-12-15 01:37:19,kcr5i2,Twice
9441,2020-12-15 01:49:54,kcr5i2,"give him time, not a lot of 2nd year guards are good in the clutch. We can afford to give him those reps in the regular season"
9442,2020-12-15 01:57:05,kcr5i2,60-20-60 club... it’s a very rare feat
9443,2020-12-15 01:58:39,kcr5i2,Everyone is too big for powell
9444,2020-12-15 02:14:48,kcr5i2,Those kickouts to Powell that kill plays become open 3s
9445,2020-12-15 02:23:25,kcr5i2,"He hasnt played real basketball in months and is returning from a serious injury

It’s gonna take some time for him to get back in rhythm"
9446,2020-12-15 02:32:57,kcr5i2,"that picture of the guy playing video games leaning back, leaning forward"
9447,2020-12-15 02:39:55,kcr5i2,You mean game 7 of a playoff series levels of noise in a preseason game doesn’t fit right?
9448,2020-12-15 02:37:29,kcr5i2,This is as bad as I've ever seen and its only a preseason game.
9449,2020-12-15 02:38:50,kcr5i2,Seriously. I don’t need to see him take another damn 3
9450,2020-12-15 02:50:27,kcr5i2,I mean Rick blown regular season because of trying out lineups. He doesn't care about the result of a preseason game.
9451,2020-12-15 02:58:36,kcr5i2,He’s not?
9452,2020-12-15 02:55:19,kcr5i2,They probably won’t play the 4th.
9453,2020-12-15 02:59:02,kcr5i2,How many preseason games are there? Just one more right? They probably won't play at all on the next one.
9454,2020-12-15 02:59:12,kcr5i2,Look how good we are without KP..
9455,2020-12-15 03:09:20,kcr5i2,Rick honest to god probably yelled at him to let it fly and he’s probably never heard that before
9456,2020-12-15 03:10:35,kcr5i2,"Love to see it, I think Rick is a big part of that, seems like his told Willie that he good to let it fly if left open and that’s probably something WCS has never been allowed to do."
9457,2020-12-15 03:28:28,kcr5i2,He's perfect for playing with all our rookies too. If they get stuck they can just dump it to him and he can do something with it. Perfect pressure release valve for them.
9458,2020-12-15 02:09:21,kcr5i2,"Don't jump to conclusions, replay showed portis was really close to his arm. Not sure the achilles is to blame but it might be"
9459,2020-12-15 02:19:19,kcr5i2,"Lmao people are finicky as fuck, we already won 1 against these guys and are still in this game too. 

It’s not like Milwaukee is a scrub team. Lol and their guys are playing minutes."
9460,2020-12-15 02:20:14,kcr5i2,"With high expectations comes all the doom and gloomers out of the woodwork.

Same thing happened with the Rangers, though they continually talk shit while still being woefully misinformed."
9461,2020-12-15 01:56:20,kcr5i2,?? Literally every comment here is saying that he's slowly improving into a decent point guard. Not sure which comments you're looking at
9462,2020-12-15 02:15:08,kcr5i2,Lol... preseason game
9463,2020-12-15 02:39:20,kcr5i2,Expectations are high lol.
9464,2020-12-15 02:43:25,kcr5i2,This is still mild. Those in fb will be a lot worse lol
9465,2020-12-14 16:10:54,kcr5i2,"Rick won't change the lineups. Gonna wait until the regular season vs. the Bucks.

Actually would like to see WCS starting."
9466,2020-12-15 02:23:08,kcr5i2,He moves like he has ankle weights compared to last season. These last 2 games he can't get by his defender
9467,2020-12-15 02:24:51,kcr5i2,"Lazy passes, airball floaters, fadeaway 3 point shots with 22 seconds on the shot clock - it looks like he doesn't care at all."
9468,2020-12-15 02:41:54,kcr5i2,Don't you dare slander the Future Mav lol
9469,2020-12-15 00:51:31,kcr5i2,and he was Steve Nash's agent
9470,2020-12-15 01:20:50,kcr5i2,For me also
9471,2020-12-15 01:21:26,kcr5i2,STREAMZ my guy
9472,2020-12-15 01:35:44,kcr5i2,Dude had no space to work with in Philly. He’ll have more opportunity here
9473,2020-12-15 01:36:21,kcr5i2,oh you were wrong.
9474,2020-12-15 01:36:22,kcr5i2,he was great in miami... the 76ers system sucked and he had to create his own shot as the main 3 point shooter
9475,2020-12-15 01:48:44,kcr5i2,Hes a game changer for the 2nd unit
9476,2020-12-15 01:56:09,kcr5i2,Probably roasting the rookie
9477,2020-12-15 01:58:14,kcr5i2,That’s because they’re playing against maybe the best defensive lineup in the league
9478,2020-12-15 02:02:13,kcr5i2,We’ve been saying that for years now. I love Powell on offense but dude is trash on defense.
9479,2020-12-15 02:17:19,kcr5i2,I could only find bucks stream too
9480,2020-12-15 02:17:39,kcr5i2,I live in the Austin area so I get FSSW on spectrum cable.
9481,2020-12-15 02:21:48,kcr5i2,How about some Willie minutes?? Considering he’s the only healthy center we have right now
9482,2020-12-15 02:48:47,kcr5i2,mark is one of the best in the game. hands down.
9483,2020-12-15 02:54:48,kcr5i2,Get your son a jersey this Christmas as a gift to yourself.
9484,2020-12-15 02:58:47,kcr5i2,"what’s the story with portis?

edit: he broke mirotic’s face, a teammate, and was suspended 8 games"
9485,2020-12-15 03:01:54,kcr5i2,Hahah
9486,2020-12-15 03:23:45,kcr5i2,rookie
9487,2020-12-15 02:19:23,kcr5i2,Is that written in the mvp qualifying criteria? Weird. I learn something new every day.
9488,2020-12-15 02:20:01,kcr5i2,No one to blame but himself for that
9489,2020-12-15 02:00:03,kcr5i2,Gotta bring back Dampier
9490,2020-12-15 03:08:04,kcr5i2,Talk to the rockets and wizards and hornets about albatross contracts
9491,2020-12-15 03:09:21,kcr5i2,"This season could be really rough. Achilles tears take an extra season to completely return from. He should get more back by the ‘21 season, but we can’t know for sure."
9492,2020-12-15 03:10:11,kcr5i2,He will be fine. Im just glad Rick is getting him some good minutes. We will need him
9493,2020-12-15 03:11:15,kcr5i2,Don’t over react to his defense on Giannis. There’s but a few people in the league who can even attempt at playing good defense on him. Powell’s strength is not defense . If he can still be an elite roll man then he is worth it. 11 mill is not enough to be al albatross of a contract even for me in the NBA..
9494,2020-12-15 02:28:08,kcr5i2,He came in shape last season and it showed. I’m confident he will get back in shape but it’s just disappointing he didn’t it keep it up and went a step backward.
9495,2020-12-15 02:28:35,kcr5i2,how many all time greats are known for showing up fat in the preseason
9496,2020-12-15 01:30:20,kcr5i2,"That’s the Achilles. It’ll be a while before it gets better, if it ever does."
9497,2020-12-15 01:30:50,kcr5i2,looks like he hasn't played basketball in a really long time and is coming back from a devastating injury
9498,2020-12-15 02:29:23,kcr5i2,Taking a shit on offense is pretty demoralizing.
9499,2020-12-15 02:49:52,kcr5i2,i like their one guy that doesn’t sound 70... he’s been pretty fair
9500,2020-12-15 02:46:32,kcr5i2,Idk I'm honestly would prefer them to Mavs commentators.
9501,2020-12-15 02:46:04,kcr5i2,"also, we started dwight... maxi is the regular season match up"
9502,2020-12-15 03:00:12,kcr5i2,"lol ... couple of posts earlier someone was saying, he's not taking it serious enough"
9503,2020-12-15 03:02:59,kcr5i2,I mean this has been a really shortened offseason and training camp and the preseason is condensed as well...I’d prefer these guys are ready to play at seasons start in just over a week.
9504,2020-12-15 02:30:49,kcr5i2,"His style leads to lots of contact and injuries, why would he play hard in a preseason game?"
9505,2020-12-15 02:34:46,kcr5i2,"We should judge him after the first game of the season.  
Also, he should stop eating ice cream. I've seen that video where his chef said he likes ice cream."
9506,2020-12-15 02:19:13,kcr5i2,He looked gassed towards the end of last season. That’s not a rookie exclusive. Dude’s not in shape
9507,2020-12-15 01:20:53,kcr5i2,"he will, i’m not worried about that. think he really wants to get dwight in rhythm early"
9508,2020-12-15 01:23:08,kcr5i2,"Pre- 

(deep breath)

**season!**"
9509,2020-12-15 01:48:56,kcr5i2,Giving up a lot of open 3 pointers
9510,2020-12-15 01:41:16,kcr5i2,apparently they didnt for james johnson tho
9511,2020-12-15 02:38:02,kcr5i2,Jrich
9512,2020-12-15 02:39:20,kcr5i2,"rick got a tech cause he was annoyed at the play before he got a tech.

Bucks should have gotten a tech but they didnt even get a foul for hacking our player lol. Rick got mad and got a tech."
9513,2020-12-15 02:40:15,kcr5i2,Richardson got drew an obvious offensive foul that didnt get called.
9514,2020-12-15 02:44:41,kcr5i2,I watched the atl game yesterday and their starters played in the 4th
9515,2020-12-15 02:47:17,kcr5i2,Competitors compete.
9516,2020-12-15 03:03:33,kcr5i2,"Wtf is wrong with Mullin, dude was incredible."
9517,2020-12-15 03:04:36,kcr5i2,JJ is better than WCS
9518,2020-12-15 03:21:31,kcr5i2,I was thinking the same. . We all wanted to see it. Use your strengths young man!!
9519,2020-12-15 02:16:29,kcr5i2,He's looking chubbier then last year but I'll take his preseason play with a grain of salt
9520,2020-12-15 02:21:43,kcr5i2,They have been saying that shit for years now. Luka is good.
9521,2020-12-15 02:17:19,kcr5i2,"he is, fat and slow, he will be ok in a few months lol"
9522,2020-12-15 02:24:45,kcr5i2,He worked on not having a ruptured Achilles anymore. The recovery and rehab takes 9 months minimum.
9523,2020-12-15 02:27:13,kcr5i2,jhonson and willie should be second options and maxi as a starter
9524,2020-12-15 02:29:53,kcr5i2,How is his shot so bad
9525,2020-12-14 23:19:21,kcr5i2,I've been saying this all over this sub already but I agree. I want WCS to reach his full potential with us. He has all the physical tools to be an elite rim threat. He seems really happy with this squad. How dope would it be for him to have a redemption arc this year.
9526,2020-12-15 01:17:22,kcr5i2,Really?? I honestly think he looks fine
9527,2020-12-15 02:01:32,kcr5i2,Do you have any close friends with cable subscriptions? My buddy gave me his DirectTV login so that I can watch the games on my Xbox Series X using the Fox Sports Go app. The quality is really good too.
9528,2020-12-15 01:55:36,kcr5i2,Pls link. Don’t upvote this either.
9529,2020-12-15 02:07:18,kcr5i2,no way
9530,2020-12-15 02:27:59,kcr5i2,The playoffs were months ago. The “Fatigue” excuse won’t work
9531,2020-12-15 02:21:10,kcr5i2,"lol, there was no offseason."
9532,2020-12-15 02:39:49,kcr5i2,He clearly got fouled on the missed shot but they didn’t call shit
9533,2020-12-15 02:42:22,kcr5i2,we expect to go 3 preseason + 72 regular season + 16 playoff games so 91-0
9534,2020-12-15 02:41:34,kcr5i2,Nobody thinks this is a finals game. We can't evaluate players?
9535,2020-12-15 02:59:16,kcr5i2,he had one today
9536,2020-12-15 02:59:18,kcr5i2,He had one earlier
9537,2020-12-15 02:59:23,kcr5i2,"Yes, this game in fact."
9538,2020-12-15 02:59:46,kcr5i2,He did one. First posession of 2nd half this game
9539,2020-12-15 01:20:30,kcr5i2,lol u serious? obv this not a prime conditionin but if you think he's trying his best rn then idk what to tell ya
9540,2020-12-15 02:16:37,kcr5i2,pandemic luka
9541,2020-12-14 05:36:56,kcr5i2,I mean that last performance wasn’t too shabby for one half of basketball in the first game back off a layoff and him not being in his best shape quite yet
9542,2020-12-14 11:20:02,kcr5i2,"He had better numbers in his 16 minutes than steph and Murray had in 20 + minutes - so that’s that 

But yes it’s somehow disappointing that he comes back out of shape. 
I don’t know how much it’s his diet because he has a chef in Slovenia and how much is not being able to work out in a real gym- Slovenia is completely closed since October 19th because of COVID. No restaurants, gyms or even playing tennis is allowed. There is even curfew between 9 pm and 6 am"
9543,2020-12-15 02:40:58,kcr5i2,"? Luka has 7 already lol, this will never be a problem"
9544,2020-12-15 03:22:06,kcr5i2,Trash take lol
9545,2020-12-15 03:22:22,kcr5i2,Nothing tells me that
9546,2020-12-15 03:24:30,kcr5i2,"Really? He seemed very unselfish to me especially last game. Even in his interviews, he seemed like a nice kid."
9547,2020-12-15 03:23:02,kcr5i2,I see him call for the ball immediately after every rebound
9548,2020-12-15 02:48:18,kcr5i2,Where are you seeing fans who don’t like him? Not sure why. He has improved his shooting and defense every year he has been in the league.
9549,2020-12-15 02:48:39,kcr5i2,I'm not aware of any mavs fans that dislike him.
9550,2020-12-15 02:50:06,kcr5i2,Y'all out here making up narratives now?
9551,2020-12-15 02:32:44,kcr5i2,His face always turns red. He's bloated because he put on weight
9552,2020-12-15 03:28:20,kcr5i2,"Ummm what. You mean the post where you said he was 6’2 and 160 and I said it’s been well documented that he is 6’3 and got his weight up to 175 during the break? Then you said no he’s only 6’3 with shoes on and I said you know he plays with shoes on, right? Wait what the fuck was your stupid point again?"
9553,2020-12-15 02:13:57,kcr5i2,ban yourself.
9554,2020-12-15 02:14:07,kcr5i2,He's been fine?
9555,2020-12-15 02:04:13,kcr5i2,what game are you watching?
9556,2020-12-15 03:00:56,kcr5i2,"That slow luka is at 27/8/4 with +18 in 3 quarters against the bucks as well, so I guess it works for him"
9557,2020-12-14 16:42:16,kcr5i2,the league is not ready for a 40/15/15 player
9558,2020-12-15 03:32:53,kcr5i2,"Yeah, so many of his halfcourt pullups are against the Bucks"
9559,2020-12-15 01:50:21,kcr5i2,Powell is starting because he is a very nice guy. I'm not sure that's a great basketball reason.
9560,2020-12-15 03:03:20,kcr5i2,"That’s what anyone would assume but we have a coach named Rick Carlisle on our team. He played a washed JJ over Brunson cause of his vet status. He let Harrison Barnes take the most shots cause he was the vet.

This is why I’m terrified, not because Powell is stinking it up in a preseason game."
9561,2020-12-15 02:39:08,kcr5i2,"Ehh, we really need some rim protection in our starting lineup. I think we can get by with Powell and Johnson off the bench. With Powell starting, I feel like we'll start off in a hole for far too many games."
9562,2020-12-15 03:04:28,kcr5i2,"It's incredible powell is a great guy but man, he should really be fighting with willie for bench minutes not starting games Kleber is the guy at the 5 and at the 4 when Porzingis returns."
9563,2020-12-14 15:42:35,kcr5i2,Not the small green one... The 🤡 one.
9564,2020-12-15 01:06:29,kcr5i2,"We shouted, “Who made Luka leave Dallas?” when all along, it was you and me."
9565,2020-12-15 03:00:59,kcr5i2,As long as they alternate nights i’m fine with this lmao
9566,2020-12-15 03:15:02,kcr5i2,Us Americans thank you for him
9567,2020-12-14 21:05:52,kcr5i2,Like Gimli said: we'll never hear the end of it.
9568,2020-12-15 03:24:59,kcr5i2,LMao
9569,2020-12-15 03:35:29,kcr5i2,Oh no..........
9570,2020-12-15 01:54:45,kcr5i2,I thought he did?
9571,2020-12-15 04:02:06,kcr5i2,Ok coach
9572,2020-12-15 02:00:05,kcr5i2,Nah he is bad there as well. Just look at what the difference was when maxi came in for him with the same lineup around them

9574,2020-12-15 02:12:16,kcr5i2,"Expectations being high...and bitching and moaning about dumb shit are two different things.

Our fanbase is completely unrealistic with it's criticims in game threads. It's been like that since Luka got here, even in year 1"
9575,2020-12-15 01:53:11,kcr5i2,"my b, the disrespect"
9576,2020-12-15 02:37:07,kcr5i2,He doesn't have the BB IQ that Powell had but at least he had some size and athleticism. Powell just can't defend anyone to save his life and he is very limited on offense.
9577,2020-12-15 02:34:12,kcr5i2,He's played very very few minutes with Luka. I want to see him play some actual minutes before I pass judgement.
9578,2020-12-15 02:37:24,kcr5i2,"To be fair, we haven't seen much of him."
9579,2020-12-15 01:43:09,kcr5i2,"Having really athletic frontcourt players helps stifle the pick and roll when the roller rolls. You’re gonna have more athletic frontcourt players in starting lineups. Bench players also make more defensive lapses which is where good finishers flourish. Thus, the shooting is more useful in the starting lineup than it would be off the bench. In addition, we have several bigs who can shoot including WCS so we won’t run out of shooting"
9580,2020-12-15 02:16:00,kcr5i2,Yes catching lobs was legit the only thing he did well but he clearly lost some bounce and now even that dosnt look good
9581,2020-12-15 02:18:04,kcr5i2,Luka has tried to feed him a bunch of lobs he is definitely not getting up like he was.
9582,2020-12-15 02:40:54,kcr5i2,It's preseason. I think they're trying to get the new guys integrated into the offense so they're ready when it counts.
9583,2020-12-15 03:01:33,kcr5i2,We should send the sixers front office Patagonia we fleeced them so bad
9584,2020-12-15 02:51:02,kcr5i2,Doe is a perfect example of rebuilding a player. Incremental improvements to his shooting every year. Positioning and good release even if it was slow was the key for the first years. Now it’s adjusting small things like speed
9585,2020-12-15 03:23:38,kcr5i2,Your telling me Tyson would lock up stretch 5 WCS!?
9586,2020-12-14 05:45:45,kcr5i2,"It's concerning though. We have a brutal start to our schedule and we have to do it without KP, so Luka not being in shape is the last thing we need."
9587,2020-12-14 17:57:21,kcr5i2,I’ve seen it’s 80$ if you want the FSSW package.
9588,2020-12-15 02:26:11,kcr5i2,That’s why I’m saying I hope and pray it’s ring rust. That’s the scary thing with the injury. If it was just that he didn’t play thats one thing. But that type of injury can affect ur athleticism. I’m not gonna be a doom merchant like some of these other people but it’s clear he’s not up to it at least today and carlisle is trying to play him into game sharpness which is the point of preseason
9589,2020-12-15 02:42:51,kcr5i2,"Right? It's almost as if the Mavs have had only a handful of in person practices and are playing against the best defensive team in the league from last season and 9th best offensive team that upgraded their PG that is guarding Luka oh and they have the league MVP. But we suck, obviously. Oh and Luka is fat."
9590,2020-12-15 02:39:47,kcr5i2,As soon as he pops in a pnr he should take it off the dribble
9591,2020-12-15 03:03:14,kcr5i2,on the ESPN boxscore (and I think nba.com as well) he's listed as a SG
9592,2020-12-15 02:20:51,kcr5i2,Preseason is for players to get familiar with new schemes and teammates and to regain their conditioning. It's not like he has to recondition his brain to not take a fading 3-pointer on an out of bounds play with 22 seconds left on the shot clock.
9593,2020-12-15 02:31:14,kcr5i2,"It's almost as if he's playing a preseason game that literally doesn't matter at all.

These games are way more important for the new guys and rookies."
9594,2020-12-15 01:21:12,kcr5i2,I wanna scream at someone
9595,2020-12-15 01:22:21,kcr5i2,I like to pay for the things I watch whenever possible.
9596,2020-12-15 01:44:45,kcr5i2,"Lol because of two preseason games?

https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/richajo01/splits/2020

Check out his 3pt % by month

All over the place. Part of it was him always getting injured."
9597,2020-12-15 01:47:16,kcr5i2,"That dude doesn't know what he's talking about, don't bother. 

literally everybody knows the spacing in Philly was garbage and fucked up J Rich and Horford's three point shooting."
9598,2020-12-15 01:39:21,kcr5i2,"That’s a lie

Embiid and Simmons were doubled all the time. He took open catch and shoot 3s at about the same rate as in Miami"
9599,2020-12-15 02:24:08,kcr5i2,Worth a shot at least or even some bey? Rick said he’s looking at him as a 4 maybe small ball 5
9600,2020-12-15 03:28:38,kcr5i2,"Yeah. Besides that, he’s just generally a d-bag and likes to play an older style but he’s not Embiid so it’s not super efficient. I always hated him."
9601,2020-12-15 02:21:39,kcr5i2,Yup if defenders know he isn't quick enough to get by them it takes away so much of Luka's offense.
9602,2020-12-15 01:33:53,kcr5i2,"A devastating injury that can sap a player of his bounce permanently. So, it’s entirely possible this is just the new him. Rusty I get, but a lack of bounce is different."
9603,2020-12-15 02:53:15,kcr5i2,I’d even like to see Willie get some minutes.
9604,2020-12-15 03:01:14,kcr5i2,I guess he wasnt but he get mad to refs. So he does now? Idk
9605,2020-12-15 02:24:35,kcr5i2,He looked gassed towards the end of the season because he was busy dropping triple/doubles on the reg.
9606,2020-12-15 02:20:00,kcr5i2,He came into the season in shape last year.  He was out of shape for most of his rookie yr
9607,2020-12-15 01:42:40,kcr5i2,The one who explained J-Rich signing did correct the lead announcer.
9608,2020-12-15 02:47:45,kcr5i2,Harp?!
9609,2020-12-15 03:05:04,kcr5i2,Not about who’s better but who’s a better fit
9610,2020-12-15 03:25:35,kcr5i2,"Shoot 3, that is why you were drafted."
9611,2020-12-15 02:29:00,kcr5i2,Even 9 months is rare for a big. That he’s back so soon is insane.
9612,2020-12-14 23:50:14,kcr5i2,"Yeah for sure. Especially when KP is out I think WCS could be a good starting center for us. I posted a longer comment about this on some other thread, but when KP is around, I could see us starting Powell because playing KP at center all the time might not be best for his health. I don’t like Powell as the lone big man though."
9613,2020-12-15 02:07:48,kcr5i2,Well they got nothing for him
9614,2020-12-15 02:23:45,kcr5i2,I mean Game 6 was over 3 months ago
9615,2020-12-15 02:40:38,kcr5i2,He was bitching when giannis took it to the rim on him
9616,2020-12-15 02:47:33,kcr5i2,If you’re using the preseason to evaluate players you’re doing it wrong
9617,2020-12-15 01:21:16,kcr5i2,Luka is way to competitive to just not try
9618,2020-12-14 16:30:21,kcr5i2,"> Slovenia and how much is not being able to work out in a real gym

believe me he had gyms availabe to train"
9619,2020-12-14 15:11:22,kcr5i2,"I'm sure he has workout gear at home though. It's mostly concerning cause he put on so much in so little time. Like, dude, just stop eating all those cevapcici. You don't gain 10kg from sitting on your ass all day unless you eat too much anyways"
9620,2020-12-15 03:23:02,kcr5i2,He literally calls for the ball every rebound lol. And guys reluctantly give it to him
9621,2020-12-15 03:24:05,kcr5i2,"I'm no pro but I played at a decent level. I can see the body language guys have around him. I could be wrong, it's just a hunch"
9622,2020-12-15 03:27:08,kcr5i2,Yeah if anything I think he overpasses. I want him to chuck up 3s but he wants to be a good pg and pass
9623,2020-12-15 03:26:07,kcr5i2,"I'm not a body language expert, but I've played ball my whole life. You can tell when guys don't like playing with someone. I could be wrong"
9624,2020-12-15 03:25:05,kcr5i2,Yeah bro like chill. The way he claps at Boban rubs me the wrong way
9625,2020-12-15 02:48:52,kcr5i2,Mostly on Facebook groups.
9626,2020-12-15 02:33:35,kcr5i2,I don’t think he’s much bigger than last year tbh.
9627,2020-12-15 03:30:37,kcr5i2,"You big triggered 🤣🤣 he looks like Tiny Tim out there 

“If you told me he was a senior in high school I would believe you

Undersized PGs and Rick Carlisle name a better duo”

“College stats 6 2 and 160”

“6 2 at the combine”"
9628,2020-12-15 03:36:43,kcr5i2,And remember the freak vs the unicorn was a budding rivalry before Porzingis got injured on the knicks they were on the same level as stars headed to superstar level. Porzingis still has the fire to prove himself against giannis.
9629,2020-12-15 03:09:51,kcr5i2,"What

Rick Carlisle is a top 5 coach

Doubting him is insane"
9630,2020-12-15 03:01:50,kcr5i2,That's the dream
9631,2020-12-15 02:01:30,kcr5i2,What are you judging this off from? 1-2 pre season games? lmfao
9632,2020-12-15 02:11:28,kcr5i2,"its 100 percent the preseason, if he looks off in the first month I'll admit it but he won't"
9633,2020-12-15 02:38:51,kcr5i2,"He's coming off a major injury, he needs to play more so he can trust his Achilles then it'll be more fair to judge him."
9634,2020-12-15 01:48:40,kcr5i2,"WCS can't shoot, what you talking bout willis"
9635,2020-12-15 03:26:11,kcr5i2,Yes
9636,2020-12-14 17:09:09,kcr5i2,"How is this going to affect Luka's game, AT ALL? If anything his larger size will allow him to better bully guards. He's already 6'7, now he's got a linebacker frame. He hit 3/5 from 3 on Saturday and looked just as deadly driving to the basket. Let's wait to make sure his game is actually suffering before we jump to conclusions and say him having put a little more weight on will cost Dallas the season."
9637,2020-12-14 05:49:50,kcr5i2,Obviously there’s concern whenever anyone is out of shape but people had issues with jokic shape last year and he turned it around in season. Luka has also gotten into shape throughout the seasons to this point in his career so he’ll be ok this isn’t season altering or aspiration crushing by any means.
9638,2020-12-15 02:27:26,kcr5i2,"Mil is also a tougher matchup with their size

In a real matchup I’m sure we’d see more WCS"
9639,2020-12-15 03:04:34,kcr5i2,Ahh I use The Score and he’s listed as a PG. Weird.
9640,2020-12-15 01:45:27,kcr5i2,"Wrong. He took more threes with the closest defender 4-6+ feet in Miami than he did in Philly.

That's why he was a better shooter in Miami. Look for that to continue here, spacing is something Philly just couldn't provide him with"
9641,2020-12-15 01:52:44,kcr5i2,see comment below.
9642,2020-12-15 01:45:03,kcr5i2,He took more threes with the closest defender 4-6+ feet in Miami than he did in Philly.
9643,2020-12-15 01:35:03,kcr5i2,"possible yes, but being rusty right now is to be expected and not really worth concern.

And lack of bounce is also to be expected."
9644,2020-12-15 03:06:19,kcr5i2,"I think he's a better fit too, tbh"
9645,2020-12-15 02:50:04,kcr5i2,Obviously it's not that serious. But you can still see some things in the preseason
9646,2020-12-15 01:30:07,kcr5i2,"maybe, but his effort levels are always changing based on circumstances and we could see that clearly this past year"
9647,2020-12-14 16:38:48,kcr5i2,If that’s true - no one to blame but himself - he’ll learn let’s all hope
9648,2020-12-14 15:52:30,kcr5i2,"Yes I agree completely - even if he doesn’t have the gear at home he could’ve gotten it. I am just sympathetic as in the first lock down I gained like 6kg and part was not moving and part was Stress eating but again I am accountant and not professional athlete 

I say if he has a chef he should get fired - it doesn’t look good for either of them."
9649,2020-12-15 02:52:32,kcr5i2,Mavs Facebook isn’t worth your time.
9650,2020-12-15 03:01:24,kcr5i2,This is your problem.
9651,2020-12-15 02:35:07,kcr5i2,"oh, well regardless his face always turns red. Shit his face is even red in the side bar pic"
9652,2020-12-15 03:34:55,kcr5i2,"Not triggered but at no point in my post did I say he was not undersized. I just corrected your incorrect stats.

Measured: 6'1.50” barefoot, 6'3.00” in shoes. He also put on weight working out during the break and his trainer said he was up to 175. Looks like at the combine they listed him at 170. Not sure when that was and if the video where his trainer said 175 was after the combine where he added weight or if he just ate a 5lb burrito before that video 😂.

I just stated he was 6’3. Not sure why they list a barefoot stat because unless you are going up against Tyson Chandler everyone plays basketball with shoes on."
9653,2020-12-15 03:12:52,kcr5i2,We both agree that Kleber should start. I think Carlisle won’t do it but you think he will. We’ll see when the season starts
9654,2020-12-15 02:02:45,kcr5i2,Was same shit before injury. He literaly looks the same but less bouncy
9655,2020-12-15 02:15:50,kcr5i2,[deleted]
9656,2020-12-15 02:48:00,kcr5i2,I mean even before his injuries Powell wasn't great at defending bigs. Hes too small. Hes always getting out muscled and he's never been much of a rim protector.
9657,2020-12-15 01:54:10,kcr5i2,"He’s been working a lot on his shot and looked good in the last game. Over the course of the season, as his confidence and comfortability increase, he should be relatively good at it"
9658,2020-12-14 17:18:30,kcr5i2,"Well for one it will make him slower. One of the biggest reasons Luka had such a big jump in his somphore year was because he was in much much better shape. He was simply faster, could change directions quicker, could stop quicker, had more lift at the rim. It made him a nightmare around the rim for opponents, he could penetrate at will on most defenders."
9659,2020-12-14 06:01:54,kcr5i2,"> people had issues with jokic shape last year and he turned it around in season

Yes after the beginning part of the season, it took him a good while to get into shape. Which is an issue for us if Luka also has to go through a process like that. The west is brutal and our schedule start is even more so brutal without KP."
9660,2020-12-15 03:06:10,kcr5i2,Just checked nba.com. He's listed as PG so ESPN seems to not have changed his designation
9661,2020-12-15 01:48:38,kcr5i2,"He took more shots overall in Miami

The rate he got open threes was very similar. Hold on I’ll post the numbers."
9662,2020-12-15 01:52:33,kcr5i2,"100% correct. I just checked the numbers... between 4-6 feet and 6+ feet in miami his last year was 383 shots in 73 games for 5.25 a game... in Philly it was 196 in 55 games for 3.56 a game. so no, it’s not close or because ben or joel were doubled."
9663,2020-12-15 03:29:53,kcr5i2,The lack of bounce is concerning though. It’s also “expected” that he’s never the same player he was before the injury.
9664,2020-12-15 03:07:02,kcr5i2,Clearly not. This lineup has been great and was great last game.
9665,2020-12-14 16:41:46,kcr5i2,im going to go into this season dissapoointed but hope that this is only because he expected for season to continue in march and ok lets say he didnt have time.. but if same thing happens next year then im really dissapointed in Luka!
9666,2020-12-14 16:30:58,kcr5i2,ryan is that you?
9667,2020-12-15 03:39:21,kcr5i2,You said he wasn’t undersized and he looks tiny
9668,2020-12-15 03:15:19,kcr5i2,"No I think Dwight will start

Kleber is a better player but having him on the bench strengthens the 2nd unit.

Plus Dwight works very well with Luka and needs to get his rhythm back. Gotta think long term too."
9669,2020-12-15 02:28:28,kcr5i2,lol true
9670,2020-12-15 01:58:11,kcr5i2,"Offseason shooting and working on it doesn't mean you're a shooter yet bro. I agree that he's been working on it, but theres clips of every non shooting big making wide open threes in practice during the offseason only for the season to start and them make literally 2 threes the whole season. Way too soon to call him a shooter."
9671,2020-12-14 17:27:44,kcr5i2,"I highly doubt Luka hitting the gym a bit turned his ROTR season to an All-NBA season, I don't even think it was one of the biggest reasons. There wasn't a noticable difference in speed between his rookie and sophomore season. He got more playing time and was given the reigns on offense. Luka has great deceleration but that hasn't changed between workouts. He's also never been the type to get to the basket using speed with a high vertical. He gets there with craftiness, misdirection, and skill. 

Just watch, he'll continue to average around 30 a night and maybe even more. 


And by the way, I don't even think he's gained much weight if any at all. I think all of you are being deceived by the white undershirt he had that reached to his neck. If he doesn't have it on tonight I think he'll look the same as he did in the bubble."
9672,2020-12-14 06:03:07,kcr5i2,I agree the west is brutal but a difference maker for Dallas that doesn’t get discussed enough is Rick Carlisle. The guy knows how to push the buttons even when we’re down guys or luka is off the floor. It’s not all on luka.
9673,2020-12-15 01:50:23,kcr5i2,"I just looked, the frequency at which he shot with the defender 4-6+ feet is higher his last year in Miami than in Philly.

3.6 versus 5.2 per game"
9674,2020-12-15 01:56:12,kcr5i2,"Yup, I see that too. Thanks for confirming it for /u/LukaSimmons 

The numbers don't lie."
9675,2020-12-15 01:59:52,kcr5i2,"I’ll just repost my other comment because you’re saying the same thing

Right, you’re not taking into account the fact that he took more shots overall in Miami

5.2 of 6.3 were open / wide open in Mia

3.6 of 4.5 were open / wide open in  Phi

5.2 / 6.3 =83%

3.6 / 4.5 = 80%

3% higher rate in Miami compared to Philly

It’s close. I can even show you clips of Jrich being left wide open from 3."
9676,2020-12-15 03:34:11,kcr5i2,you're not wrong but it's 2 games
9677,2020-12-15 03:11:01,kcr5i2,"1.5 worth sample size against the same size isn't enough to proclaim anything ""clearly"" lol"
9678,2020-12-15 03:41:52,kcr5i2,No I didn’t and if you want to go back and read my one single sentence reply to you all I did was reply to your 6’2 160lb pound comment saying it’s documented he is 6’3 and 175. But hey you keep making up whatever you want.
9679,2020-12-15 03:43:39,kcr5i2,I also think he looks tiny but that’s because he is. Doesn’t change the fact that he measured at 6’3 now does it?
9680,2020-12-15 03:46:32,kcr5i2,CherrEBear is the one who said he is not undersized.
9681,2020-12-14 17:43:29,kcr5i2,"> There wasn't a noticable difference in speed between his rookie and sophomore season

Yes there was. He was noticably quicker. It was easy to see. Obviously it's not the only reason he took a big leap, but it's massive one, since he went from an average to absolutely elite rim finisher. His elite rim finishing forced teams to double even triple team him at the rim, making it even easier for Luka to find the open man."
9682,2020-12-14 08:26:56,kcr5i2,"True, but my main issue is the fact that the standings will be so close, losing more at the start could end up being brutal. Last season the difference between us, 7th seed and the nuggets 3th seed was 4 games. It looks like the west will be even more competitive this season with pretty much everyone except OKC and Spurs improving. So the difference between 6th and 2nd could end up being like 1-2 games. I hope I'm wrong obviously."

9686,2020-12-14 18:01:06,kcr5i2,"His rim finishing is not a result of him accelerating to the basket with a burst of athleticism and jumping to the rim with a 40 inch vert. He does what he did on Saturday. He crafts his way to the basket. He'll euro step around 4 defenders in the paint like he did with 7 minutes left of the 2nd quarter in the preseason game as the fatty he's been made out to be. He'll make a run to the basket and then slow to let the defender run past him while he knocks in a floater. Let's not pretend Luka's game is in any way a reflection of the other 4 uber-athletic 1st Team All NBA players—Lebron, Kawhi, Giannis, AD. Luka is crafty and I guarantee you he will be just as crafty this season even if he doesn't ""get in MVP shape"". 

Again I'll say you're overblowing how much his weight affects his game. Injury worries, that's another story. I'd want him to lose weight to protect himself, not because he's suddenly not an elite rim finisher when he weighs 10 more pounds."

5.2 of 6.3 were open / wide open in Mia

3.6 of 4.5 were open / wide open in  Phi

5.2 / 6.3 =83%

3.6 / 4.5 = 80%

3% higher rate in Miami compared to Philly

It’s close. I can even show you clips of Jrich being left wide open from 3."

9692,2020-12-15 03:19:58,kcr5i2,lol u mad?
9693,2020-12-15 02:10:28,kcr5i2,"He had the ball way more in Miami, he shot more from everywhere. He was the 4th option in Philly. 

Look, I 100% want to be wrong and I hope he continues to shoot from 3 with no hesitation. I’m just letting you know I watched him turn down / miss plenty of wide open 3s in Philly. 

The team lacked spacing inside the paint and teams used to even play a bunch of zone against Philly."

one other thing i was thinking about is rhythm. while he may have had a difference in time of possession for each team, the being the 4th option could have impacted his rhythm on his open shots in philly."
9696,2020-12-15 03:22:07,kcr5i2,Yeah you cared until you tried to use my words against me and it backfired cuz your reading comprehension.
9697,2020-12-15 02:45:26,kcr5i2,Yeah I definitely think the rhythm was a big part. Every time he would go on a hot streak he’d get hurt again. Plus the team was disjointed on offense so they had him in different roles.

9700,2020-12-14 05:44:00,kcr42l,49ers aren't going to take another D-lineman. If they are boring they will take an interior o-lineman or corner.
9701,2020-12-14 05:50:54,kcr42l,"For the Jets, not sure why I keep seeing mocks with us taking a CB with that Seattle pick. Especially with guys like Bateman and Slater still available. I understand we need corner help but I think the OL and weapons for Trevor is way more important and will be at the top of JD's list this off-season. 

The Jets have been top 5 worst offenses in the league year after year after year... Giving our new Franchise Superstar a new and improved OL is so much more important than helping our already solid defense.

This is the first time in a long time we have had abundant draft capital. Enough bad offense. I want points dammit!"
9702,2020-12-14 07:57:12,kcr42l,"Damn, Trey Lance falls and we take a tight end. I understand that we have the worst tight end room in the league, but passing up on a QB when they know Newton/Stidham isn’t the answer just seems dumb.

It’s not like there are any quality starting QBs in free agency. In a league where bad QB play tanks a team, I don’t see how BB passes Lance up. His athleticism could help cover up the deficiencies in our passing attack and keep the chains moving like how Cam did this year at times. I understand that Kyle Pitts has been electric this year...but he’s a tight end... no point taking one when you don’t have anyone for them to throw the ball accurately to, especially when we have already invested 2 3rd round picks and 2 4th round picks in tight ends last year. It would be wiser to take a gamble on a potential franchise QB rather than using the highest draft pick we’ve had in years to take a tight end."

9705,2020-12-14 18:02:51,kcr42l,"Any mock with Cleveland using a 1st round pick on a WR is vomit inducing.

Barring something absurd like Chase or Smith being available at the end of the 1st, there’s no scenario where the Browns draft a WR in the first round with the defense in the shape that it is

In this scenario, Wade is a perfect fit. The Browns have 2 corners currently under contract for 2021 and one of them is Greedy Williams who hasn’t played in almost a year. Wade slides nicely into the slot and also can rotate in as the 3rd safety in Joe Woods defense"
9706,2020-12-14 13:57:35,kcr42l,"> Vikings: DT Christian Barmore, Alabama: IMO this guy is best DT in this weak class. He’s racked up 5 sacks this year and still hasn’t hit his peak potential. MIN is in need of more iDL talent.

Love the iDL pick for the Vikings. 

Daviyon Nixon is starting to look as an interesting prospect for that DT1 pick. I don't know enough about draft stock to know if he'd be worth a mid first round pick though. In the same amount of games as Barmore he has 0.5 less sacks, 7 more TFL, 23 more tackles (9 more solo tackles). Nixon is also currently a semi-finalist for both the Bednarik Award and the Outland Trophy."
9707,2020-12-14 15:17:19,kcr42l,"Jaycee Horn top 10? Javonte Williams in the 1st? Packers take Zaven Collins?

I think I'm in love with this mock draft."
9708,2020-12-14 15:38:27,kcr42l,While I don’t disagree the Chargers might go corner. It wouldn’t be because the spot opposite Hayward is up for grabs. Michael Davis has been the Chargers most consistent defensive back this year
9709,2020-12-15 16:50:11,kcr42l,I think Javonte Williams is gonna be a stud but was hoping he'd fall to the Jets in the third round or so.
9710,2020-12-14 05:54:10,kcr42l,"As someone who is still trying to figure out who the top edge in this class is, why do you value Paye over Rosseau? It's so close between the two, but just want to hear your opinion!"
9711,2020-12-14 15:37:03,kcr42l,"If we were to take Barmore, I would be sick. Idl is a need but that’s way too high for him, in a scenario where Darrisaw or a qb falls to us, they need to be taken, idl can be taken in 3rd but a one is too valuable to use on a guy who hasn’t proven to be a top 15 pick"
9712,2020-12-14 17:37:18,kcr42l,"Even if OBJ's days in Cleveland are numbered, they're unlikely to target a WR early in this draft. OV is unlikely to be resigned at a team friendly number, and an edge opposite of Garrett is a significantly higher need. It is more likely the Browns spend the majority of the early draft Rs1-4 on defensive talent, as the defense needs a lot."
9713,2020-12-14 07:29:51,kcr42l,"Sorry but the Chargers one is all wrong. Casey Hayward has fallen off a cliff. Michael Davis is rock solid. If we’re replacing anyone, it’s not Michael Davis."
9714,2020-12-14 14:56:39,kcr42l,Liam Eichenberg is also one of my fav prospects and I would love him at 26. Something about those Notre Dane OL...
9715,2020-12-14 16:35:47,kcr42l,"Love the draft, but if Greg Rousseau falls to the Lions IMO that’s a slam dunk pick for them, and I think Cosmi and Darrisaw could both go higher"
9716,2020-12-15 01:55:48,kcr42l,If we draft Paye at 5 I might consider killing myself. PAss rush has been bad but not worth using our top pick on. Linebacker or Secondary needs to be the top pick
9717,2020-12-14 15:18:44,kcr42l,"The Panthers aren’t going to draft a linebacker with their top 10 pick. It’s just not going to happen. We have a much bigger need at CB for immediate results and QB for long term results. 

Every single one of these drafts has just drafting Parsons and it makes it obvious that the people doing these mocks don’t watch Panthers football. ILB is one of the least impactful positions on the defense. A top corner would have immediate upgrade to the defense whereas Parsons isn’t even considered a poor man’s Luke Kuechly. 

If you’ve watched any of our last few games, our line backer play dramatically improved by us benching Whitehead (worst MLB in the league) for Carter (who’s not the worst MLB in the league). Our defense isn’t a top 10 defense, but a CB would have a bigger impact on the field than a new MLB."
9718,2020-12-14 06:26:50,kcr42l,"in my humble opinion, there are *pressing* needs at qb and those needs far out-weigh the secondary, offensive line, and edge. cutting jimmy g and drafting the heir-apparent in the first is what i want."
9719,2020-12-14 06:06:17,kcr42l,"Yeah I was tempted to go Farley there but I just couldn’t get over thinking of Bosa, Armstead, Dee Ford and Rousseau as a pass rush rotation. Would help ease things up on secondary IMO"
9720,2020-12-14 15:34:49,kcr42l,"Imma niner fan, and I feel like we don’t get any pressure at all on the QB. Yes, we are missing Bosa, but someone is that crucial on our team, I don’t want everything to rely on Bosa. I personally I think Roseau is the best edge in the draft to. I really like that pick."
9721,2020-12-14 06:03:03,kcr42l,I agree with this. When you take a QB you can let the defence suffer for a bit. Protect your investment and make sure Trevor is in the best position possible to succeed
9722,2020-12-14 06:08:37,kcr42l,"Oh for sure. The biggest reason I gave them Stokes is that their tops corners seem to be Bless Austin, Bryce Hall and Lamar Jackson. Stokes is better than all of them. With the depth of the WR class, they can take someone in 3rd round or even later and STILL get good value. In this mock Slater is still available so hypothetically, the Jets could take him at 33"
9723,2020-12-14 20:42:56,kcr42l,Our defense against the pass is terrible. I don’t think taking a CB would be a bad move. I’d probably wait til the second round and use the Seattle pick on OL or WR but we’ve got so many holes on both sides of the ball that going bpa at positions of need is a decent strategy. Also we’ve got a ton of cap space so it’s tough to know what we’re really gonna need until after free agency
9724,2020-12-16 14:02:50,kcr42l,Trey Lance isnt falling out of the top 10 this is just recency bias. If Zach Wilson was a freak like Lance than I would agree I dont see a team taking Wilson over Lance especially if its an offensive HC. I think the Falcons take lance at 7.
9725,2020-12-14 15:38:06,kcr42l,And then Ja’marr becomes a top wr so that would be 3 years in a row they pass on a wr for them to get burnt on it
9726,2020-12-14 13:44:20,kcr42l,Miami is too smart to go RB in the first. Especially with our needs on the line and at LB and edge. Gaskin has also looked pretty good and so has Ahmed. I'm sure we'll take someone in the 4th or so but 1st is highly unlikely.
9727,2020-12-14 15:00:23,kcr42l,[deleted]
9728,2020-12-14 06:05:12,kcr42l,"As of now I prefer Paye because of his athleticism and production. He had 24 QB pressures in the first 3 games alone. Rousseau, although he had 15 sacks last year, much of it was “right place right time.” He also lined up quite a bit inside and from his measurements he’s only ~260ish. I’m not sure that will work in the NFL.

Either way I do think both of them are Top 15 picks off ceiling alone. Paye was listed as Bruce Feldmans #1 athletic freak and Rousseau has shown flashes of being a dynamic edge defender similar to Danielle Hunter of the Vikings"
9729,2020-12-14 17:38:09,kcr42l,"Not OP, but Rosseau imo is a 5T, so unless you're looking at running a 3-4, I'd take Paye."
9730,2020-12-15 04:25:54,kcr42l,ooh i'll send you mcglinchey and #11 for #2?
9731,2020-12-14 06:54:12,kcr42l,"I fully agree. I want a QB. I honestly love our roster and had we been fully healthy all year I think we would be challenging for the #1 seed again in the west.


The way I see it is our roster is about to flip. In our superbowl year our defense carried our team and we won by grinding teams down on the ground and dominating on defense. I think our defense is slowly slipping away. Not to even average levels (I still think we have the talent to be top 10) but we won't be the best defense in the league like we were our SB run. We simply can't win with a game manager and a good defense. We need a dynamic gun slinging QB who can get it out wide to Deebo and Aiyuk and throw it down the seam to Kittle and make plays. I just don't see Jimmy making enough plays. He is too immobile in the pocket, too prone to stupid mistakes and too bland. 


If we are going to win our offense will need to put pressure on opposing teams offenses to keep up. We will never be the Chiefs, but we need to get more out of our offense. Jimmy's contract also prevents us from keeping a handful of role players and potentially a superstar. Unfortunately, he has had his opportunity to prove it and he hasn't. I think another year of Jimmy is a year where we hold back a top tier talented roster from its potential."
9732,2020-12-14 06:37:10,kcr42l,"Be careful what you wish for, unless you're getting Lawrence youre not likely to get someone who's going to come in and be better than Garoppolo right away. Your team is built to win now and was just in a super bowl, I'd ride it out with a healthy Garoppolo next year."
9733,2020-12-15 04:23:28,kcr42l,"Rousseau isnt a BAD choice exactly and they need a speed rusher to replace Dee Ford but if the chance to get Wilson or Lance is there, I think they take it. They will probably restructure Jimmy for cap flexibility and give the rookie a year to learn. 

I do want them to go edge in round 2 even tho I think CB is more likely and they can get a OG in round 4."
9734,2020-12-15 04:24:14,kcr42l,I think we would be better off taking a guy like Basham in round 2. We need a ford replacement and to me Rousseau is more like Bosa. The way the wide 9 works you need a speed guy
9735,2020-12-14 14:15:00,kcr42l,"That's true, if Slater was there at 33 (which seems more and more unlikely) I'd be stoked to take him there. I do like what I've heard about Stokes, but again, #1 priority should be to give Trevor everything he needs to succeed. And again, our defense is already pretty solid"
9736,2020-12-14 14:37:13,kcr42l,Yeah I didn’t think RB was the way to go but they went that route in the mock and I just wondered why they picked that guy instead of ETN or Najee.
9737,2020-12-14 15:34:10,kcr42l,"Wow, yeah absolutely. For some kind of reason I completely forgot to look at who was still on the board."
9738,2020-12-14 06:10:52,kcr42l,Valid points. Paye I think is the safer option due to his athleticism and proven ability as a run defender/pass rusher while Rosseau is more of a work in progress. Hope that Rosseau bulks up next next few months and he puts on a show at the combine
9739,2020-12-15 04:43:30,kcr42l,hey! no!
9740,2020-12-14 07:26:40,kcr42l,"we would've been on top of the world, the nfc is mediocre as hell this year.

everything you said is absolutely right. the roster *will* flip if we don't find the money to retain the players who make us the 2019  superbowl team and this is what people evaulating the niners don't understand. the roster that one would say is ready to *win now* won't exist if we keep jimmy's current salary on the books. like...take a look at the list of impending free agents and the players in need of extensions - it's not pretty. outside of a few games, jimmy wasn't even *the* reason we were dominant in 2019. it was kyle, it was the run game (**second** in rushing offense, **fifteenth** in passing offense), and it was the defense which was arguably the best in the nfl at the time. jimmy isn't the guy you fear on offense. he isn't even the guy who you can rely on to not go down and ruin the season because, yes, the backups are that bad. no elite o-lineman, nor corner is going to win us a superbowl. an elite qb will and i, for one, think it makes too much sense to 1) keep the roster together using the money we'd get from cutting jimmy for cap relief and 2) take a risk for once and get the guy you believe in.

>jimmy's contract also prevents us from keeping a handful of role players and potentially a superstar.

fucking thank you."
9741,2020-12-14 06:42:06,kcr42l,"okay, but here's what people aren't getting. there are a lot of impending free agents next year, including much of the secondary, juice and an elite franchise left tackle (williams). players like fred warner will need extensions in addition to those other deals and without cutting jimmy, the money to do so *isn't there*. if we keep jimmy - which we quite literally can't afford to do - it will result in losing key pieces of the roster and consequently, we wouldn't be returning with the same team as seen in 2019. the level at which he plays, including physical limitations and all, isn’t worth that. i’d go as far to say that jimmy is holding the roster back from its true potential, and i’m not just talking about his health or the amount of money he makes.

at this point, i would rather pin my hopes on the draft and retain the other (younger) cornerstones of the franchise. i’m done."
9742,2020-12-15 20:13:42,kcr42l,"If u watch Rousseau, a lot of the time, he’s not the one recking havoc, he can’t be the number 1 pass rusher i feel like. Pair him with Bosa, he would be dominate. On film, a lot of time, I see him get pressure from help from the secondary being lockdown, and having Quincy Roche is also helping him. But that’s why we have Bosa, then Rousseau gets easy one on one situations, which leads to easy pressures. But tbh, I’d rather have a QB, or maybe a CB, but we can’t pass up on Greg Rousseau if he’s still at our pick."
9743,2020-12-15 04:45:28,kcr42l,But then you could have McG AND Eichenberg. Big win for you and your love of Nd OL

How could the pivot of blame from Leland to Sarah be effective? My assumption has always been that Sarah is just another victim of Leland/BOB. Anyone that could rape his daughter could certainly be expected to mistreat his wife as well. Here's what gets me: I can't imagine that Ray Wise only shot that scene where he says ""find Laura"" - shouldn't there be more? I feel like Sarah has got him in that house somehow, and I even think we hear Ray Wise again later in one of the scenes set inside the Palmer house.

My original interpretation was much more face value - that he's being forced to kill her because she won't accept BOB into her, and if she would just do so she could live*, but your take about self-blame rings very true, especially (and I know you've said that this is about the show and the film and not the book, but still...) given some of the stuff towards the end of Secret Diary.

I do think the self-sacrifice/salvation theme, the Christ-like death for the sins of others, is an aspect of what we see in the train car.

9760,2020-12-15 17:28:59,kckpnh,"Thank you!

No degrees to speak of, but I have done a little writing professionally, some magazine stuff. I just love language.

And  my wife is a professional copy editor, and I have her check my work before posting to ensure a high-quality post.

Everything else is just lots and lots of reading on my own, I’m strictly auto-didactic (I’m 58), career-wise I’ve worked in graphic design for print publishing as well as being a musician.

I had been a fan of Lynch since seeing Blue Velvet when it was in theaters, and when Twin Peaks premiered I was an avid watcher.

And for the next decade or so I read whatever books I could get my hands on about Lynch.

With Season 3 and Reddit, I was able to take my turn as the writer, as opposed to being the reader.

It’s a challenge to put the ideas into words without minimizing the source material, but so far I’m very happy with what I’ve written.

thanks for asking!"
9761,2020-12-17 00:55:20,kckpnh,"To me it’s more that Judy represents the truth that Laura is trying to suppress, which is directly correlated in her mind with mother walking in the room while Laura is doing the terrible thing that she’s been manipulated into thinking is her fault. It’s not that Sarah is evil and complicit, it’s that “Mother is coming” is basically an apocalyptic statement for Laura. What will happen if mother finds out? The end of the world. Avoid, avoid, avoid."
9762,2020-12-17 00:12:54,kckpnh,"Since we’re only to Part 3, who knows where it will end? There is something about Sarah obviously. Hopefully by the end I’ll have a clearer vision of her. Thanks for reading!"

Fire Walk With Me is a very misunderstood movie, even by people who love it.

Once The Missing Pieces became available the whole film opened up for me.

And of all the books I believe the Secret Diary probably is the most important."
9764,2020-12-23 23:21:34,kckpnh,"*No more Blue Rose*: The Blue Rose is something unnatural, so it’s existence indicates an unreality, and no Blue Rose means reality.

*No more Stars* as when the stars disappear as the Major’s head passes by the metal box illustrating the ending, and as the song No Stars describes. Going back to the place where it all began.

*Only the One remains*. The “split” Laura is finally reunited as One.

Basically in the 25 years since Laura’s mental “split” she has experienced “dream” after “dream,” each built from abstractions of the basic elements of her real life, or at least the aspects that she has tried to keep repressed.

With the reintroduction of the Good Cooper, each of these “dreams” can come to an end.

That will leave just one dream remaining, the original Twin Peaks Dream that began as the Pilot episode.

These ideas re-present themselves throughout Season 3."
9765,2020-12-17 21:42:04,kckpnh,"Can't wait! Would you agree that it is Laura as well, in a way?"
9766,2020-12-14 20:31:21,kckpnh,"Exactly, but Jesus as well has a ""death fantasy"" on the cross - that of a content family man. Have to think more about this, but seems interesting with regards to Laura und Cooper. 
Anyways, the cross/crucification as a symbol alone is fascinating. Also never grasped the Mauve Zone scene to this extent until your post. And I had thought I knew some!"
9767,2020-12-24 06:59:04,kckpnh,"Very clear understandable (and a very awesome process philosophically)

To me the only “reality” we see in all of Twin Peaks is contained in Laura’s story in FWWM, and even there Laura’s hallucinations begin to intrude as we watch.

The opposite is happening in Season 3, memory of reality is pushing back into the “dreams.”"

9778,2020-12-13 18:08:19,kcdvqb,"Yeah I think they are more encompassing terms than we give them credit for. It feels like the words “Ice” and “Fire” get used to remind us what book we’re reading. 

However, we see people consumed and reanimated by fire OR ice; people travel to one such far waste or another, seldom to return - and if they do, never to venture again. I think George is giving us a glimpse at a certain time that takes a particular character or characters through trials of both ice AND fire. There’s talk of heroes in these books but the tales are embellished and fragmented. We’re witnessing the dawn of new gods, stories, and songs that will wipe all others from relevance. 

It’s a pitfall of the science fiction and horror genres to be criticized with a hefty amount of Saganism, or the idea that big change or big things must be caused by big notions or ideas. When in reality the smallest ideas birth the biggest change, ideas so small and brief that sometimes words say too much. It’s taken 4 books but I would be remiss to mention the huge psychosomatic need for safety shared by many of the key characters. For Dany it spills into every decision she makes, her first thoughts upon seeing the Dothraki’s captives are relating their lack of safety, hope, and reassurance to hers. For Arya and Sansa, their safety hinges much more fatalistically and closer to the wire than Dany. For Jon, it’s love and acceptance. We really see these desires play out as these people grow up. Even Cersei and Jaime, who are already grown, grow some more. 

All I’m saying is what if we’re seeing Ice and Fire play out. How long can we leave this situation in the oven before the house burns down? How long can I leave this situation in the freezer before it’s unrecognizable?"

This issue came up before on my previous post, this was the solution provided by Mega Support:

Open your MEGA account in a browser. Just before you are about to click 'Download' of the affected file press F12 (Option + cmd + J) to open your JavaScript Console. The screen will divide. Type 'skipcheck=1' in the bottom line of the Console, click 'Enter' and then select the 'Download' in your MEGA account window."

I'm not sure how my post come up since I have zero Elliot Smith in my collection, but I'm glad that it found you!

1. Copy the long code near the top of the post

2. Google ""base64"" and click on the first site that pops up (one that ends in .org), 

3. Make sure ""Decode"" is selected at the top once you're in the website (it should be the default)

4. Paste the code in the top field where it reads ""Type (or paste) here...""

5. Press ""< DECODE >""

6. The decoded link which would be a Mega link in this place will show up on the bottom field

7. Copy and paste this link to your URL and that should take you to my index

Hope that helps."

Most of the titles I only have one version of, so searching up the catalog numbers and including them to my organization system doesn't make much sense in my specific case. For the ones I have multiple versions of I do specify in the sub folders, to the best of my ability, which version's which. For the most part it is simply one click away to find out the number of tracks included that would then give you a clue as to whether it's a version you already have or not. Hope that helps."

Also by incomplete discographies, I wasn't talking about the index, but you don't have every Future or Kid Cudi studio album for example. I'm not telling you that you need to go find them, just saying. No mistake on Your Part. Also on another note there's a problem with the album ""live.love.asap"" which sounds all distorted on some songs, I just ended up sticking to my mp3 version of it."

10016,2020-12-13 03:18:21,kbkof3,Fk it Nate Hinton=Marcus Smart 2.0
10017,2020-12-13 01:16:48,kbkof3,I hope our future mav superstar is ok..
10018,2020-12-13 01:25:16,kbkof3,Luka in midseason form vs the refs already lol
10019,2020-12-13 01:37:53,kbkof3,Burke in bubble form
10020,2020-12-13 02:22:08,kbkof3,"First half impressions:

- Luka is definitely out of shape
- Josh Green looks like a great cutter
- Josh Richardson's shot looks pretty good"
10021,2020-12-13 02:35:17,kbkof3,Kleber defense on Giannis >>> Powell defense on Giannis
10022,2020-12-13 02:38:24,kbkof3,Love seeing the guys up cheering for Josh Greens Defense.
10023,2020-12-13 02:42:25,kbkof3,both Maxi and James Johnson (probably) are better Giannis defenders than Powell. hope Mavs never try that again
10024,2020-12-13 02:54:40,kbkof3,terry's shooting form is incredible
10025,2020-12-13 03:03:35,kbkof3,We got a squad bois
10026,2020-12-13 02:01:25,kbkof3,"Ok look 

I know it’s very harsh to point his out but 

Giannis is bullying Powell"
10027,2020-12-13 02:07:26,kbkof3,Luka is back
10028,2020-12-13 02:09:44,kbkof3,"I think you guys are drawing too many conclusions outta a preason game, Bucks just playing good defense on Luka on his drives and stripping him off the ball a couple of times, they are one of the best interior-D teams in the league... dosent really look like hes out of shape to me, same as last season pretty much"
10029,2020-12-13 02:10:18,kbkof3,That was a good half. Giannis just flat out unstoppable but I think we made some heady plays on d on him so that's a real improvement. JRich's impact is also very noticeable.
10030,2020-12-13 02:36:53,kbkof3,Bucks’ starters gonna get more preseason minutes per game than playoff minutes per game
10031,2020-12-13 02:43:05,kbkof3,The difference between Maxi and Powell against Giannis
10032,2020-12-13 02:53:16,kbkof3,"if you squint, hinton looks like a knock off delon wright"
10033,2020-12-13 03:17:16,kbkof3,"Got Marcus Smart undrafted, not too bad."
10034,2020-12-13 03:22:47,kbkof3,"Great pre season game apart from Luka looking pretty doughy.

Richardson is brilliant, just what we needed. Powell looks fit, Maxi was great, Brunson on not even 2mil a year is criminal, Hinton rocks, boys are long."
10035,2020-12-13 01:37:55,kbkof3,Burke tribute to Dirk
10036,2020-12-13 02:13:16,kbkof3,Love J Rich. Love James Johnson. Love what Josh Green is flashing. I’m excited for this season.
10037,2020-12-13 02:49:24,kbkof3,I mean we’re all thinking it... but if I’m Giannis I’m salivating at playing with guards like this.
10038,2020-12-13 02:56:43,kbkof3,I completely forgot KP wasn't even playing. Bruhhhh
10039,2020-12-13 03:17:21,kbkof3,"Terry just got the respect of that team, fucking love it"
10040,2020-12-13 03:18:26,kbkof3,Lmaooo bey a bully
10041,2020-12-13 03:18:55,kbkof3,Bey with the block is just icing on the cake lmao. The boys look EXCITING
10042,2020-12-13 03:19:07,kbkof3,Luka is such a kid 😂😂
10043,2020-12-13 03:19:18,kbkof3,I knew I was onto something when I read and looked into Hinton. He's got a fire burning in his heart and hornets up his ass. What a steal.
10044,2020-12-13 01:52:31,kbkof3,Luka looks younger somehow
10045,2020-12-13 02:37:46,kbkof3,"Green moves really well, I see why they chose him over Saddiq Bey."
10046,2020-12-13 02:38:25,kbkof3,Holy shit im so hyped that defense is looking mighty good
10047,2020-12-13 02:42:51,kbkof3,"I gotta say, I really have liked WCS's body language. He's been very active and engaged"
10048,2020-12-13 03:02:57,kbkof3,Tyrell Terry still very raw. Gonna be a project and won’t see much time
10049,2020-12-13 03:12:02,kbkof3,"Nate Hinton, that’s the name"
10050,2020-12-13 03:13:00,kbkof3,Is Hinton already a top 10 rebounding guard? This man is a snagger what the fuck
10051,2020-12-13 03:18:51,kbkof3,Giannis: look at the mavs what a solid team
10052,2020-12-13 01:16:53,kbkof3,"Dorian bro wtf 

That does not help with bringing Giannis"
10053,2020-12-13 02:13:12,kbkof3,"I don't give a single shit about Luka's weight. You lot called him fat before his rookie season, you called him fat before his sophomore season, and as we all witnessed - it meant fuck all.

So I don't care if you think he is fat and needs to lose weight."
10054,2020-12-13 01:31:53,kbkof3,lol saving some of these comments so when Luka hits MVP mode I can enjoy people calling him out of shape and disappointing after 5 minutes of a preseason game
10055,2020-12-13 01:45:51,kbkof3,"I can't believe we got the first, second, and third best player in the Knicks trade..."
10056,2020-12-13 02:11:08,kbkof3,Didn’t Powell tear his achilles? I can’t believe it’s been so long that he’s already back.
10057,2020-12-13 02:48:49,kbkof3,So everyone on our roster looks good now..
10058,2020-12-13 02:48:56,kbkof3,Ok 3rd unit 🔥🔥
10059,2020-12-13 02:49:35,kbkof3,"Damn, the deeper we go the better we look out there lol"
10060,2020-12-13 02:49:46,kbkof3,"Boban + 4 shorters, I mean shooters."
10061,2020-12-13 02:54:16,kbkof3,Giannis gone
10062,2020-12-13 03:00:25,kbkof3,Everyone is relying on Boban right now.
10063,2020-12-13 03:00:50,kbkof3,I know it’s the first preseason game but this is actually looking like a really good team (besides 1Q).
10064,2020-12-13 03:11:34,kbkof3,was more impressed with hinton than i was with terry this game
10065,2020-12-13 03:16:42,kbkof3,Hahaha gotta love the bench
10066,2020-12-13 02:54:50,kbkof3,Not tryna overreact but I think Terry will fill out the Curry role pretty quickly
10067,2020-12-13 01:42:36,kbkof3,Ready to see some tyrell terry.
10068,2020-12-13 01:47:08,kbkof3,I can already tell James Johnson is an upgrade over Justin Jackson
10069,2020-12-13 01:50:33,kbkof3,Offense is gonna get better. But the defense is already showing
10070,2020-12-13 01:50:54,kbkof3,Im surprised how much ball handling Josh Green has gotten already
10071,2020-12-13 02:02:47,kbkof3,Damn I can't wait for KP to be back
10072,2020-12-13 02:04:18,kbkof3,Where are the calls for Luka????
10073,2020-12-13 02:07:05,kbkof3,DAMN LUKA
10074,2020-12-13 02:37:50,kbkof3,Maxi heard us talking shit about his bubble 3pt shooting
10075,2020-12-13 02:37:53,kbkof3,"josh with another cut, he sees where he needs to be and that is very impressive to me already"
10076,2020-12-13 02:39:16,kbkof3,Jalen playmaking and Green cutting backdoor does things to me...
10077,2020-12-13 02:43:13,kbkof3,Bucks starters still out there. Nobody told coach Bud it was a preseason game lol
10078,2020-12-13 03:04:06,kbkof3,U can tell Rick's been working with Bey on his shot
10079,2020-12-13 03:04:12,kbkof3,Bey is fucking nice
10080,2020-12-13 03:04:54,kbkof3,Love Brunson coaching up Terry.
10081,2020-12-13 03:07:57,kbkof3,The AAC should be nothing but cutouts of Dirk in the stands.
10082,2020-12-13 03:15:47,kbkof3,NATE HINTON SAY HIS FUCKIN NAME
10083,2020-12-13 03:16:30,kbkof3,[deleted]
10084,2020-12-13 03:19:03,kbkof3,"""No freebies""

-Tyler Bey 12/12/2020"
10085,2020-12-12 13:05:44,kbkof3,Oh how Ive missed pinning these :) LETS GOOOOO
10086,2020-12-12 15:12:35,kbkof3,I just want to see tyrell terry hit some big threes and brunson hit a couple of midrangers
10087,2020-12-13 01:11:57,kbkof3,We look a bit rough lol.
10088,2020-12-13 01:21:40,kbkof3,u can see that both teams was working on defense and they have no legs
10089,2020-12-13 01:36:54,kbkof3,Giannis: I did not hit him! I did not! Oh hi Mark
10090,2020-12-13 01:37:36,kbkof3,Iverson!!!
10091,2020-12-13 01:51:16,kbkof3,"The shot isn’t falling, but this group is playing hard and I can dig it. Love what James Johnson can bring in particular. Glad to be back boys and girls!"
10092,2020-12-13 02:08:01,kbkof3,Luka chill
10093,2020-12-13 02:08:08,kbkof3,"if Luka can have even an average 3P% and FT%, we've got an MVP on our hands"
10094,2020-12-13 02:08:39,kbkof3,Solid half without KP ngl
10095,2020-12-13 02:10:34,kbkof3,Those 3s were OBSCENE
10096,2020-12-13 02:18:57,kbkof3,Lukas 3s are wet af
10097,2020-12-13 02:25:57,kbkof3,"If Burke continues the development, that pickup could be one of the best low cost finds for the Mavs in a while"
10098,2020-12-13 02:26:18,kbkof3,God I missed Brunson
10099,2020-12-13 02:26:28,kbkof3,Our bench scoring on their starters 🔥🔥🔥
10100,2020-12-13 02:27:21,kbkof3,Our bench is a lot better than last season
10101,2020-12-13 02:28:04,kbkof3,The 2nd unit with multiple small guards is Carlisles wet dream
10102,2020-12-13 02:37:50,kbkof3,Josh Green is so active on defense. I love it. He helps and recovers so well.
10103,2020-12-13 02:37:58,kbkof3,JOSH GREEN
10104,2020-12-13 02:46:13,kbkof3,"Lmao that was for sure Luka screaming ""AND ONE!!!"" after Boban's shot"
10105,2020-12-13 02:47:45,kbkof3,Nate Hinton doing Nate Hinton things
10106,2020-12-13 02:55:51,kbkof3,i know it's preseason but please don't choke this lead
10107,2020-12-13 03:03:55,kbkof3,"If we can have a 15 man roster this year, that's really going to help us. Hinton and Bey look good."
10108,2020-12-13 03:05:03,kbkof3,"JB going straight to Terry, giving him advice. Love that"
10109,2020-12-13 03:05:45,kbkof3,terry got talent but itll be good for him to have a year to sit learn and polish his game
10110,2020-12-13 03:12:34,kbkof3,Have yall ever been this excited over a preseason game? I'm hyped.
10111,2020-12-13 03:16:10,kbkof3,HINTON FOR MVP
10112,2020-12-13 03:16:29,kbkof3,Bro Hinton is everywhere on the court rn. Hes doing it all
10113,2020-12-13 03:16:30,kbkof3,Man I love the bench
10114,2020-12-13 03:24:08,kbkof3,What a showing!! Preseason or not that was some damn good Mavs basketball!! Let’s go Mavs!! So hyped for this next season
10115,2020-12-13 03:26:36,kbkof3,"Nate Hinton is gonna be our Marcus Smart. I figured he'd make it eventually, but he looks ready to go - or at least as ready as you can look in the first preseason game. The rebounding alone is ridiculous.

Everybody who looked at his college highlights must've thought ""What  am I missing here, how's this guy undrafted"" -- and it turns out we weren't missing anything, the NBA scouts just had a collective brain freeze. Dude is a steal."
10116,2020-12-13 03:32:34,kbkof3,"Really liked what I saw from Terry on defense, albeit against smaller guards, but he was able to for the most part keep them in front of him. I think he needs to look for his shot more - it was clear to me he wasn't really hunting to score which is his main strength."
10117,2020-12-12 07:45:30,kbkof3,I miss basketball so much that i am gona wake up at 2 am and watch the game...for sure 😜
10118,2020-12-13 01:37:21,kbkof3,Green looks good
10119,2020-12-13 01:25:10,kbkof3,There goes Luka not back in transition nba is back baby.
10120,2020-12-13 01:35:00,kbkof3,Oh my god I love Josh Green
10121,2020-12-13 01:37:30,kbkof3,Now this is some ugly basketball lmao
10122,2020-12-13 01:37:59,kbkof3,Trey Burke baby
10123,2020-12-13 01:38:09,kbkof3,"I feel like all of our new players and guys coming off of injury have been playing the best so far lol

Definitely looks like the first preseason game from both teams though, not surprised"
10124,2020-12-13 01:40:38,kbkof3,I know this is based off 1 quarter of basketball but Green looks like a player. Richardson looks like everything I hoped he would be. If Terry comes in and shows flashes I’m going to be very confident in this year. Also Powell looks quick!
10125,2020-12-13 01:46:11,kbkof3,Rick already in midseason form in challenges
10126,2020-12-13 01:46:54,kbkof3,"i know we’re in the mavs sub, but i love Khris’s game, super smart and a 3 level scorer"
10127,2020-12-13 01:59:24,kbkof3,JRich is a fucking bucket
10128,2020-12-13 02:06:37,kbkof3,Didn’t know Giannis became Nash from the free throw line
10129,2020-12-13 02:07:07,kbkof3,"Giannis will make almost everyone defending him look trash, not just Powell"
10130,2020-12-13 02:15:42,kbkof3,"JRich looks pretty good so far. Dwight looks a little off, not cutting like normal and not being on the same page as Luka, but it's expected and it'll get better through the season. I would like to see more of the new guys and rookies. Green moves well at least."
10131,2020-12-13 02:25:39,kbkof3,Lol why's Giannis out there?
10132,2020-12-13 02:26:19,kbkof3,JB IS COMING ALIVE
10133,2020-12-13 02:26:44,kbkof3,Brunson and Burke are Barea and Harris 2.0
10134,2020-12-13 02:27:01,kbkof3,That Brunson/Burke combo could be similar to JJ and Harris
10135,2020-12-13 02:27:16,kbkof3,"Kleiber’s worked on his shot, his release is much faster, even on his freethrows. I love it"
10136,2020-12-13 02:33:47,kbkof3,Lol Bud playing his starters during the 2nd half of a preseason game of all times.
10137,2020-12-13 02:35:09,kbkof3, this place is gonna overreact to every Willie mistake and it'll be so annoying
10138,2020-12-13 02:35:58,kbkof3,"Everytime i hear ""floater"" i remember JJACKS

miss u buddy, u and your pointless floaters"
10139,2020-12-13 02:37:07,kbkof3,KL3B3R
10140,2020-12-13 02:38:41,kbkof3,I am really liking what Green is bringing rn
10141,2020-12-13 02:38:54,kbkof3,Green my mf dude
10142,2020-12-13 02:39:22,kbkof3,"He's a little raw on offense (as to be expected) but Green looks so good so far. His effort with his size is exactly what this team has been missing. Once he gets more fundamentally sound on defense, he's gonna be a problem"
10143,2020-12-13 02:39:28,kbkof3,We want to see tyrell terry in the 4th
10144,2020-12-13 02:42:20,kbkof3,lol at Kleber wincing before the contact.
10145,2020-12-13 02:42:34,kbkof3,are they gonna play geeiannis until the 4th...?
10146,2020-12-13 02:46:49,kbkof3,Giannis didn't want any of Boban. No wonder he's done for the night
10147,2020-12-13 02:47:47,kbkof3,I SEE YOU HINTON
10148,2020-12-13 02:50:26,kbkof3,"This team is so deep, it actually kind of sucks because these guys will deserve minutes but there won't be enough to go around."
10149,2020-12-13 02:50:54,kbkof3,Bench has looked great! Very excited for our burke brunsion bench mob
10150,2020-12-13 02:52:22,kbkof3,"I will stan Hinton all season long, love that kid."
10151,2020-12-13 02:54:59,kbkof3,terry is not scared to shoot
10152,2020-12-13 02:55:56,kbkof3,Watching a lead melt away in the fourth quarter is the quintessential Mav's experience. Glad the NBA is back!
10153,2020-12-13 03:01:46,kbkof3,Terry doesn’t look nearly as disasterous on defense as I thought he might
10154,2020-12-13 03:03:28,kbkof3,Terry gotta shave that peach fuzz off his chin
10155,2020-12-13 03:03:49,kbkof3,Bey got a jumper???
10156,2020-12-13 03:05:41,kbkof3,Nate Hinton needs to get locked with a real contract for us. Not a two way contract.
10157,2020-12-13 03:12:08,kbkof3,You can tell Hinton wants to be in the league
10158,2020-12-13 03:12:55,kbkof3,Terry is gonna need some time
10159,2020-12-13 03:16:46,kbkof3,[deleted]
10160,2020-12-13 03:19:44,kbkof3,"WE GOTTA TEAM. Catch yall on Monday, be safe out there"
10161,2020-12-12 07:25:16,kbkof3,"Game will be at 0200 CET (Würzburg/Ljubljana/Belgrade) and 0300 EET (Riga).

While it is at 0300 CEST, that’s not useful to many as that’s **summer** time and it’s December. That might confuse some people in the CET timezone."
10162,2020-12-12 09:19:08,kbkof3,I think Richardson starts and Kleber comes off the bench. Rick loves Powell. He wants to start him.
10163,2020-12-13 01:24:03,kbkof3,didn’t make it but so good to see dwight with some acceleration
10164,2020-12-13 01:36:33,kbkof3,"Green looks quick, I like it"
10165,2020-12-13 01:36:46,kbkof3,layup didnt fall but nice move by Green
10166,2020-12-13 01:37:41,kbkof3,Burke is clutch.
10167,2020-12-13 01:42:12,kbkof3,🤙 Maxi
10168,2020-12-13 01:42:21,kbkof3,"Right now, Maxi is our team MVP. His shot form is so pretty."
10169,2020-12-13 01:42:45,kbkof3,i know it’s preseason... but def a charge.. shouldn’t have to use your challenge for that call
10170,2020-12-13 01:47:24,kbkof3,James johnson just pushed middleton 😂
10171,2020-12-13 01:48:08,kbkof3,Feels so good to have a dude with a blackbelt in karate on the squad
10172,2020-12-13 01:49:57,kbkof3,"fucking up giannis' shot after his rookie year has to be one of the all-time coaching fuckups, man would've been the best player of all time if he still shot like that lol"
10173,2020-12-13 01:50:16,kbkof3,brunson playing good
10174,2020-12-13 02:00:17,kbkof3,Now Luka is looking like himself again.
10175,2020-12-13 02:03:53,kbkof3,the mavericks do not have a guy that can cover giannis in the slightest lol
10176,2020-12-13 02:08:07,kbkof3,Luka & Giannis exchanging 3's  is exactly what we all wanted to see
10177,2020-12-13 02:08:18,kbkof3,Luka is PURE rn
10178,2020-12-13 02:09:06,kbkof3,"curious to see if Luka has learned catching fire from 3 just opens up his drives more, instead of heat checking more attempts"
10179,2020-12-13 02:19:40,kbkof3,"Ngl, that was pretty entertaining to watch instead of the usual cookie cutter interviews they do for media day we see uploaded. It's just fun seeing these guys interact with each other."
10180,2020-12-13 02:21:53,kbkof3,I wanna see Terry in the second half!
10181,2020-12-13 02:25:30,kbkof3,"Glad to get our ""real stars"" out there."
10182,2020-12-13 02:26:06,kbkof3,man does the fucking bench looks great or what

10188,2020-12-13 02:38:08,kbkof3,Green is so active
10189,2020-12-13 02:38:21,kbkof3,josh green guarding Middleton and looking good
10190,2020-12-13 02:40:58,kbkof3,Uh hey y’all I just wanted to make sure you knew that i fucking love Josh Richardson.
10191,2020-12-13 02:41:44,kbkof3,Maxi stopping Giannis again!!
10192,2020-12-13 02:42:35,kbkof3,Surprised Giannis is still in.
10193,2020-12-13 02:45:58,kbkof3,Lol Giannis really needs to get out of that team
10194,2020-12-13 02:48:38,kbkof3,We got a fuckin team of players fam
10195,2020-12-13 02:48:42,kbkof3,Hinton doing his thing
10196,2020-12-13 02:49:04,kbkof3,BENCH MOBBB
10197,2020-12-13 02:49:22,kbkof3,Am I dreaming right now? Are these mavs players?
10198,2020-12-13 02:49:30,kbkof3,Terry looks like a kid playing with men
10199,2020-12-13 02:49:39,kbkof3,Get you a 3rd unit that can to that
10200,2020-12-13 02:50:42,kbkof3,"boban, iwundu, and three rookies with 2 on 2 ways are killing actual (you get what i mean) nba players"
10201,2020-12-13 02:51:58,kbkof3,Giannis like 🙃 watching his team
10202,2020-12-13 02:54:18,kbkof3,Boban with the phantom calls again....
10203,2020-12-13 03:02:26,kbkof3,This is Bobi's Daycare Hour
10204,2020-12-13 03:02:47,kbkof3,I like the Boban and sons lineup
10205,2020-12-13 03:03:12,kbkof3,"Is it crazy to think that we have 3 legit units? 

All this depth is a very hopeful sign for this team."
10206,2020-12-13 03:07:17,kbkof3,"I usually take a realistic approach to any given situation and when I seen everyone in our sub saying ""we won the draft"" I thought we may be homering/ over exaggerating a tad but no, we got some really good talent."
10207,2020-12-13 03:09:05,kbkof3,That 60th pick emulating his best step back Luka
10208,2020-12-13 03:12:13,kbkof3,Terry needs to learn when he is trouble and how to bail out of it.
10209,2020-12-13 03:12:18,kbkof3,[deleted]
10210,2020-12-13 03:13:22,kbkof3,bruh my choke PTSD kicking in im literally shaking cryng on the floor
10211,2020-12-13 03:14:42,kbkof3,Are we allowed to keep Hinton available for every game this season even tho he's a 2 way player ?
10212,2020-12-13 03:16:00,kbkof3,"Hinton is clutch, lads"
10213,2020-12-13 03:16:12,kbkof3,lol. The love for Terry
10214,2020-12-13 03:16:37,kbkof3,I was honestly most excited with Nate Hinton and man he’s really putting work!
10215,2020-12-13 03:19:17,kbkof3,Bey said get that weak shit outta here for the end
10216,2020-12-13 03:19:37,kbkof3,"It feels fuckin good to have basketball back, our guys who I wanted to see looked really good! Obviously I want to see Luka but he’ll be elite."
10217,2020-12-13 03:23:43,kbkof3,Anyone catch why Luka looked annoyed after the game when he was behind THJ? He also looked stiff. Hope he didn't tweak his back earlier in the game
10218,2020-12-13 03:28:08,kbkof3,"People says Hinton wasn't drafted so... Can't we keep him in the team now ? 

Man NBA rules are complicated."
10219,2020-12-13 01:24:48,kbkof3,why the fuck is Luka complaining to the refs in a preseason game lol. Just play dude.
10220,2020-12-13 02:54:33,kbkof3,[deleted]
10221,2020-12-12 20:00:20,kbkof3,I really hope the Mavs.com stream looks passable.
10222,2020-12-13 01:11:43,kbkof3,Glad to see Powell back on the court
10223,2020-12-13 01:11:50,kbkof3,Happy to see Dwight back out there :)
10224,2020-12-13 01:15:16,kbkof3,Yeah this definitely looks like a pre-season game lmao. I'm still happy tho
10225,2020-12-13 01:24:10,kbkof3,J Rich defense is def pretty good so far
10226,2020-12-13 01:24:21,kbkof3,I already love JRICH
10227,2020-12-13 01:29:11,kbkof3,Luka needs to chill out for real
10228,2020-12-13 01:34:51,kbkof3,Nice cut Josh!
10229,2020-12-13 01:35:05,kbkof3,JOSH GREEN BUCKET!
10230,2020-12-13 01:35:29,kbkof3,Rick getting a close look at Giannis. Lol
10231,2020-12-13 01:36:44,kbkof3,"josh has so much energy, it’s great"
10232,2020-12-13 01:36:50,kbkof3,I’m liking Green
10233,2020-12-13 01:37:41,kbkof3,great shot trey!
10234,2020-12-13 01:37:45,kbkof3,Tricky trey
10235,2020-12-13 01:40:09,kbkof3,"Josh Green seems like what we wanted Justin Jackson to be, too early to judge tho"
10236,2020-12-13 01:41:36,kbkof3,After the first qtr I feel like we are down by 20. Haha
10237,2020-12-13 01:43:50,kbkof3,"Both arms raised, both feet set, THATS A CHARGE. 

I should be a ref seems pretty easy"
10238,2020-12-13 01:50:42,kbkof3,This second unit is looking pretty nice
10239,2020-12-13 01:54:11,kbkof3,Look at that luka defense
10240,2020-12-13 01:55:04,kbkof3,I predicted Luka’s defense would improve the most this season. Clippers series showed me something in his defensive ability
10241,2020-12-13 01:56:03,kbkof3,I love Jrich
10242,2020-12-13 01:57:43,kbkof3,"Luka amusing himself with a 3, you love to see it"
10243,2020-12-13 01:57:56,kbkof3,That was clean by Luka
10244,2020-12-13 01:59:11,kbkof3,Guarding Giannis with Powell.... LMAO
10245,2020-12-13 01:59:15,kbkof3,"Okay Luka seems to be giving 75% effort now, he looks comfortable"
10246,2020-12-13 02:00:01,kbkof3,Richardson is going to make a bag this year.
10247,2020-12-13 02:00:57,kbkof3,Luka looking in top shape this quarter
10248,2020-12-13 02:07:44,kbkof3,Curb your 3 pointers
10249,2020-12-13 02:24:49,kbkof3,Burke picking up right where he left off
10250,2020-12-13 02:27:40,kbkof3,Burke + Brunson are going to absolute cook second units
10251,2020-12-13 02:27:42,kbkof3,The value we picked Burke back up for is absolutely outstanding.
10252,2020-12-13 02:28:02,kbkof3,"I don't know why, but I already love Josh Green."
10253,2020-12-13 02:28:09,kbkof3,I'm so stoked for this combo this year. Shades of '11 JJ.
10254,2020-12-13 02:28:17,kbkof3,The floaters! 🤯
10255,2020-12-13 02:29:15,kbkof3,Burke is a great switch up when Luka goes out.
10256,2020-12-13 02:29:26,kbkof3,"Just tuned in to see our defense forcing 2 back to back turnovers

What is going on"
10257,2020-12-13 02:32:18,kbkof3,Willie Trill going off
10258,2020-12-13 02:34:49,kbkof3,Green defense is actually disrupting the Bucks. And he’s locked up Middleton on multiple occasions.
10259,2020-12-13 02:35:18,kbkof3,Green passes the eye test on defense. Keeps track of his rotations and is strong enough to not get bullied
10260,2020-12-13 02:35:40,kbkof3,"Guess we found our starters. 

Now we need to figure out that bench with Luka."
10261,2020-12-13 02:36:14,kbkof3,Cmon rick put in tyrell
10262,2020-12-13 02:37:29,kbkof3,"Middleton good versus the 1st unit, struggling vs Green 👀"
10263,2020-12-13 02:39:53,kbkof3,I want our third team to get a chance at MIL's starters.
10264,2020-12-13 02:40:27,kbkof3,"Green seems to really understand what to do as a roleplayer. Great off ball movement and defensive rotations. Is he some transcendant talent on offense? Fck no, but when you play with so many talented playmakers, you just need to make right offball runs and you will get easy points."
10265,2020-12-13 02:41:32,kbkof3,"Early thoughts: Depth looks actually better (if that's possible) and defense is dramatically better--more active, better on ball, better help defense."
10266,2020-12-13 02:41:49,kbkof3,"If we see a lot of Burke and Brunson playing together, I suggest we call them the Killer Bs"
10267,2020-12-13 02:42:16,kbkof3,"maxi just has giannis number man, he literally knows everything he wants to do"
10268,2020-12-13 02:42:17,kbkof3,Terry time pls Rick
10269,2020-12-13 02:42:25,kbkof3,"Yeah, giannis just cant run thru maxi like he does with powell lol"
10270,2020-12-13 02:43:02,kbkof3,Giannis cant deall with the Kleber
10271,2020-12-13 02:45:17,kbkof3,BOBAN as our 11th man just isn’t fair
10272,2020-12-13 02:45:56,kbkof3,I missed the absurdity of watching people try to defend Boban.
10273,2020-12-13 02:47:14,kbkof3,HINTON looking active
10274,2020-12-13 02:47:42,kbkof3,OMG Hinton
10275,2020-12-13 02:47:43,kbkof3,Hinton is our best player don’t @me
10276,2020-12-13 02:47:44,kbkof3,I love Hinton already
10277,2020-12-13 02:48:13,kbkof3,Boban and 4 dwarfs. 😉
10278,2020-12-13 02:48:17,kbkof3,"Nate Hinton just needs to make the team. He really could be something like Pat Bev, probably better too."
10279,2020-12-13 02:48:19,kbkof3,Bey looking like JJ with that floater
10280,2020-12-13 02:49:27,kbkof3,Loving the energy rn!
10281,2020-12-13 02:49:36,kbkof3,We got some dogs on defense man
10282,2020-12-13 02:50:21,kbkof3,I hope Giannis is watching closely 👀
10283,2020-12-13 02:50:29,kbkof3,Giannis is so gone
10284,2020-12-13 02:50:35,kbkof3,Depth 👀
10285,2020-12-13 02:51:55,kbkof3,Good to see the 3rd unit getting minutes against their 2nd unit
10286,2020-12-13 02:51:58,kbkof3,"Man our 3rd unit is cooking these dudes lmao. Ol scrub ass Bobby Portis is gettin worked by Boban and Nate Hinton, catch this heat ho."
10287,2020-12-13 02:52:08,kbkof3,"I mean this is definitly the deepest team in the league for sure. If we take just best 10 or so, lakers look better, but mavs legit dont have one guy right now that you know wont be getting any minutes...when boban is thr last guy off your bench you know the team is deep af"
10288,2020-12-13 02:53:18,kbkof3,"Damn, Terry looks like he is 14."
10289,2020-12-13 02:53:34,kbkof3,Our bench just cooked their starters.
10290,2020-12-13 02:53:35,kbkof3,Damn the bench is killing the bucks lol
10291,2020-12-13 02:53:58,kbkof3,Yes Tyrell hit one. Finally got that jitters out of the way
10292,2020-12-13 02:54:09,kbkof3,Let’s go tyyy
10293,2020-12-13 02:59:13,kbkof3,The Hinton to Boban connection is something I didn't know I needed in my life.
10294,2020-12-13 02:59:34,kbkof3,Hinton has a chance to crack the rotation?
10295,2020-12-13 03:00:19,kbkof3,Iwundu with the plays
10296,2020-12-13 03:11:00,kbkof3,Why is Bud playing Bobby Portis right now?
10297,2020-12-13 03:11:18,kbkof3,Nate Hinton is a magnet with that ball. Oh my god.
10298,2020-12-13 03:11:34,kbkof3,As Arenas would say: Hinton goes balls hard
10299,2020-12-13 03:13:30,kbkof3,Put Boban back in with his step sons.
10300,2020-12-13 03:15:10,kbkof3,"Nate ""I want a fukin contract"" Hinton"
10301,2020-12-13 03:16:16,kbkof3,I wonder why Johnson hasn’t played in the second half
10302,2020-12-13 03:16:33,kbkof3,Bench trying to hype Terry up lol
10303,2020-12-13 03:19:33,kbkof3,What a legendary bottle flip by Luka.
10304,2020-12-13 03:23:50,kbkof3,"Terry looked a lil overmatched to me... still had a couple of good plays,  but in my mind he played the worst of the rookie group... not enough for me to bail but just something to watch.  

However, all Mavs picks had moments... and Hinton..  wow.

We got some pieces of the puzzle here folks. The fact 2 way players can stay 50 days? That may be huge if that guy is Hinton"
10305,2020-12-13 02:04:34,kbkof3,Luka kinda movin like Jokic out there lol
10306,2020-12-13 03:21:44,kbkof3,Someone should post the charge celebration to r/nba. That was a great moment after a rough debut for Terry.  Love this team
10307,2020-12-13 03:04:47,kbkof3,"Well I was wrong about Green and Terry. Green looks way more ready than I thought, and Terry looks a little shaky. Mavs do know better than me, who would’ve thought?"
10308,2020-12-13 03:16:07,kbkof3,"Nate Hinton has outscored, outrebounded and outassisted Anthony Edwards. 3rd round 1st pick > 1st overall?"
10309,2020-12-13 03:19:55,kbkof3,"Rookie Ladder

1. Hinton
2. Green
3. Bey"
10310,2020-12-13 03:20:28,kbkof3,"Depth and Defense. It’s too early to tell, but at this moment it looks like we have greatly improved both of those aspects of our team. Brunson looks like a legit floor general, and Maxi has somehow managed to improve both his shooting and defense. Hinton, and Iwundu are great pickups as well. Can you imagine how good this team will be when KP comes back? 

As for the Luka “Problem”. I don’t want to sugarcoat his performance, but I don’t think it’s a big deal. He looked pretty good on defense, both his 3pt shot form and selection seem improved. He didn’t seem to force as many shots. Luka was terrible in the paint today. That’s the only major issue that I saw."
10311,2020-12-12 16:52:19,kbkof3,Props to you for including European Time zone. The Mavs fanbase in Europe has been strong in the past and continues to grow
10312,2020-12-12 20:48:49,kbkof3,"Hey.. I had recently got a new roku smart tv and as such I have just today set up screen mirroring for this purpose.

10314,2020-12-13 01:19:31,kbkof3,One of the extremely rare occasions in which we are more excited to see the bench rather than the stars. I wanna see those rookies.
10315,2020-12-13 01:21:34,kbkof3,Preseason horror
10316,2020-12-13 01:23:12,kbkof3,I like our rebounding so far!

10321,2020-12-13 01:28:18,kbkof3,Luka...is not looking good lol

10325,2020-12-13 01:36:58,kbkof3,That was a really smart pass by JB
10326,2020-12-13 01:38:29,kbkof3,Cant wait to watch Burke hit those all year
10327,2020-12-13 01:38:33,kbkof3,Our bench unit actually looks good

10336,2020-12-13 01:59:32,kbkof3,J Rich got me excited with this shooting display.
10337,2020-12-13 01:59:34,kbkof3,look at jrich man
10338,2020-12-13 02:01:03,kbkof3,We look like the #1 offense again lmao
10339,2020-12-13 02:06:17,kbkof3,Bruh Powell looks nice he did not get injured at all. Medical staff comes through again!
10340,2020-12-13 02:08:28,kbkof3,Luka's shot lookin' good. Let's go!
10341,2020-12-13 02:21:28,kbkof3,Holy hell we're living off the 3pt line this game. 35FG% damn
10342,2020-12-13 02:26:53,kbkof3,OH BABY HERE WE GO!
10343,2020-12-13 02:27:32,kbkof3,I missed Brunson so fucking much
10344,2020-12-13 02:27:36,kbkof3,Trey Brunson gonna be a fun bench backcourt
10345,2020-12-13 02:29:09,kbkof3,Man I wish we had this Brunson and Burke combo in the playoffs! At least offensively it’s pretty nice.
10346,2020-12-13 02:29:10,kbkof3,Rick carlisle: okay lets embarrass their overhyped starters
10347,2020-12-13 02:29:28,kbkof3,"TB + JB are so lethal lmao, might be tough on defense but they are so good on offense"
10348,2020-12-13 02:30:47,kbkof3,I wanna see WCS and james johnson in the floor
10349,2020-12-13 02:31:57,kbkof3,Willie out here impressing and making his case for more playing time
10350,2020-12-13 02:33:45,kbkof3,This might be the year of Maxi Kleber to be honest
10351,2020-12-13 02:35:54,kbkof3,Giannis helping his future teammate up.
10352,2020-12-13 02:37:43,kbkof3,Why the fk are Giannis and Middleton still in this game???
10353,2020-12-13 02:38:20,kbkof3,"Green is an excellent cutter, some of his attempts haven't fallen today, but this one was nice"
10354,2020-12-13 02:38:22,kbkof3,Josh Green looks ready
10355,2020-12-13 02:38:22,kbkof3,Bench on Fuego!!
10356,2020-12-13 02:38:38,kbkof3,Damn Trey looks good
10357,2020-12-13 02:39:39,kbkof3,Our bench looks great offensively. I feel like our bench mob every year are never a problem.
10358,2020-12-13 02:40:14,kbkof3,Second unit is lit!
10359,2020-12-13 02:42:05,kbkof3,"So far, there hasn’t been a single person that doesn’t appear to have bought in to the selfless play Rick shoots for on offense. All players playing within themselves and in ways that highlight their natural strengths."
10360,2020-12-13 02:43:03,kbkof3,Maxi just got crushed by giannis
10361,2020-12-13 02:43:39,kbkof3,"Kleber's out of the bubble, he's back to cookin again thank God."
10362,2020-12-13 02:43:49,kbkof3,I love this team. AND we still got KP coming back gotdamn
10363,2020-12-13 02:44:25,kbkof3,Terry time!!
10364,2020-12-13 02:44:42,kbkof3,Terry is in lets go
10365,2020-12-13 02:44:45,kbkof3,Boban and the babies.
10366,2020-12-13 02:45:21,kbkof3,MUTHAFUCKIN BOBAN
10367,2020-12-13 02:45:28,kbkof3,"Is Boban the greatest of all time?

Does a bear shit in the woods?"
10368,2020-12-13 02:45:42,kbkof3,is that nate hinton
10369,2020-12-13 02:46:05,kbkof3,We also have the best 3rd Unit in the league too
10370,2020-12-13 02:48:39,kbkof3,I love how we're up 15 w/o KP and them playing their starters for an extra quarter. Time to overreact
10371,2020-12-13 02:50:12,kbkof3,Bey defense
10372,2020-12-13 02:50:22,kbkof3,Iwundu islanders...ASSEMBLE!
10373,2020-12-13 02:51:27,kbkof3,It feels so wrong thinking that we are gonna probably cut some of the players in the third unit
10374,2020-12-13 02:53:10,kbkof3,Bey's defense man.. ooooweeeee
10375,2020-12-13 02:54:18,kbkof3,Tyrell! Let’s go!
10376,2020-12-13 02:55:13,kbkof3,Im having a hard time on picking those who deserve to make the cut geez
10377,2020-12-13 02:55:45,kbkof3,Iwundu with the green light. Lol.
10378,2020-12-13 03:01:53,kbkof3,Hinton has a wonderful feel for where a rebound is gonna go
10379,2020-12-13 03:03:20,kbkof3,can hinton cracked the rotation
10380,2020-12-13 03:03:23,kbkof3,This dude even has the same exact haircut as Luka lmaoo
10381,2020-12-13 03:05:32,kbkof3,"Bey is my favorite rookie of the night, not trying to do too much just fitting nicely into a role, which is all you want him to do in his first year."
10382,2020-12-13 03:05:45,kbkof3,Love watching defenders trying to run around Boban's screens lol
10383,2020-12-13 03:11:55,kbkof3,Patterson kinda looks like Jermaine O'Neal from far away
10384,2020-12-13 03:12:36,kbkof3,Hinton passes quite well
10385,2020-12-13 03:15:03,kbkof3,Nate Hinton my GOD
10386,2020-12-13 03:15:23,kbkof3,Tyrell Terry might be spending a lot in the G League. He’s still very raw and needs to improve that body for the league
10387,2020-12-13 03:15:28,kbkof3,Hinton for Rookie of the Year! Don't @ me lol
10388,2020-12-13 03:15:39,kbkof3,Hinton is EXTREMELY intriguing. Wow.
10389,2020-12-13 03:18:22,kbkof3,WE WIN
10390,2020-12-13 03:27:12,kbkof3,"Player thoughts:

Luka’s threes looked good, his drives didn’t 
Richardson with great 3nD
THJ couldn’t buy a bucket
DFS was there
Powell looks surprisingly healthy 
Brunson is an elite backup pg
Burke is our Lou Will
Josh Green excellent on ball defender and played unselfish 
Kleber shut down Giannis in the 3rd
WCS learned to shoot but is trigger happy
Terry hit 1 three but didn’t do anything else :(
Hinton is an elite guard rebounder 
Iwundu is not good
Bey could be a good 3nD guy
Boban is a garbage time cheat code"
10391,2020-12-13 03:32:15,kbkof3,"Don’t want to overreact to a preseason game but man this team has a future if those guys deep in the bench keep playing well like that. 

Hinton looks like he can straight up contribute off the bench right now so far. Bey had some really nice flashes as well. Wes was trying to do too much on his own at first but he played well also. 

Terry is a project but give him a few years and a few more pounds and I think he can be really good for us. He hit some nice shots and that charge he took was nice, just gotta be ore confident and learn how to play in the NBA at that size. 

Every young player contributed, that was very promising to watch. I think all the guys I mentioned will be staying around for a while."
10392,2020-12-13 01:40:22,kbkof3,Josh Green is a stud. So damn good on defense and high IQ
10393,2020-12-13 02:10:44,kbkof3,"I’m not saying Luka should be with the Miami Heat, but I wonder what would happen if Mavs imposed the body fat rules they have"
10394,2020-12-13 02:03:21,kbkof3,"so the Mavs cannot say ""we're going to take defense more seriously this year"" and continue to start Dwight Powell. those two are mutually exclusive things."
10395,2020-12-12 12:44:46,kbkof3,"Wait, it's on TONIGHT?

Oh, sweet mother of Jesus, I've been without bball for too long, I need this shit so bad."
10396,2020-12-13 01:06:20,kbkof3,Anyone else having issues with it going full screen?
10397,2020-12-13 02:05:03,kbkof3,"Refs in mid season form, calling nothing on Luka"
10398,2020-12-13 02:08:35,kbkof3,No more dessert for Luka. He needs to drop 10 lbs
10399,2020-12-12 20:46:59,kbkof3,Jalen Brunson 100% to start the season?
10400,2020-12-13 01:14:19,kbkof3,It's honestly so great to see Dwight on the floor
10401,2020-12-13 01:21:05,kbkof3,Luka always wears the under shirt when he's a little over weight. THJ can't buy a bucket so far. JRich looks awesome on both ends.
10402,2020-12-13 01:21:34,kbkof3,"Lmao pre season basketball, everyone looks slow as hell"
10403,2020-12-13 01:24:57,kbkof3,J-Rich making moves
10404,2020-12-13 01:26:31,kbkof3,"Luka is forcing shots right now, he’s gotta chill out"
10405,2020-12-13 01:31:10,kbkof3,JB looked like he aged 10 years lol
10406,2020-12-13 01:35:14,kbkof3,"Green is ready to play, sweet"
10407,2020-12-13 01:41:33,kbkof3,"Maxi 👌💦

There's the lead"
10408,2020-12-13 01:41:58,kbkof3,Nice pass Giannis
10409,2020-12-13 01:44:32,kbkof3,"I love all these open looks were getting just gotta convert. Lol btw I also love Green's aggressiveness getting to the hoop, he'll be just fine. Defense looking really good though!"
10410,2020-12-13 01:47:24,kbkof3,bad blood james
10411,2020-12-13 01:48:30,kbkof3,Morris got a shout out lol and it felt like a 'name a punchable face' type of name drop
10412,2020-12-13 01:52:07,kbkof3,"Green off ball : 10/10

Green on ball : 2/10"
10413,2020-12-13 01:52:29,kbkof3,"guarantee it's gonna be luka, terry, and willie trill out next"
10414,2020-12-13 01:55:32,kbkof3,"When Luka feels pain, I feel anxiety..."
10415,2020-12-13 01:56:45,kbkof3,There you go J-Rich!
10416,2020-12-13 01:57:38,kbkof3,THERE WE GO MAVS NATION
10417,2020-12-13 01:57:57,kbkof3,SPLASH
10418,2020-12-13 01:59:49,kbkof3,Get in there J-Rich!!!
10419,2020-12-13 01:59:55,kbkof3,Yeah I think J Rich will fit quite nicely here
10420,2020-12-13 02:00:26,kbkof3,"offense coming back, let’s go!"
10421,2020-12-13 02:00:58,kbkof3,Luka getting back into the groove
10422,2020-12-13 02:01:09,kbkof3,Luka starting to rack up assists
10423,2020-12-13 02:17:54,kbkof3,"Really hoping J-Rich maintains this confidence even when he goes on a cold streak.

When he’s hitting 3s he’s a very valuable piece"
10424,2020-12-13 02:22:03,kbkof3,Still see Powell as a bench guy when KP gets back. In certain matchups like Bucks (Giannis) James Johnson or Kleber are the much better options.
10425,2020-12-13 02:23:34,kbkof3,"Obviously preseason historically means nothing in the grand scheme of things. But holy hell Richardson looks like exactly what the doctor orders. Also, Burke and Brunson were shockingly disruptive defensively. Was weird to see."
10426,2020-12-13 02:25:26,kbkof3,I love Brunson and Burke.
10427,2020-12-13 02:25:54,kbkof3,Let's gooo
10428,2020-12-13 02:26:41,kbkof3,Bubble Burke babee.
10429,2020-12-13 02:26:45,kbkof3,BENCH MOBBBBBBB
10430,2020-12-13 02:26:56,kbkof3,That was so smooth by Brunson
10431,2020-12-13 02:26:58,kbkof3,Jalen you brilliant bastard!
10432,2020-12-13 02:27:01,kbkof3,Woooo damn that 2nd unit is fucking fireeee. I'm so glad JB is back
10433,2020-12-13 02:27:07,kbkof3,I'm wet
10434,2020-12-13 02:27:10,kbkof3,"Hey yow clippers, want some point guards?"
10435,2020-12-13 02:27:27,kbkof3,JB so good!
10436,2020-12-13 02:27:27,kbkof3,Bench mob is back
10437,2020-12-13 02:27:27,kbkof3,Goddamn brunson and burke destroying these suckers
10438,2020-12-13 02:27:43,kbkof3,We might have the best second unit this season. Everyone's a bucket
10439,2020-12-13 02:28:00,kbkof3,I’m not gay or anything but I would top the bench mob if they keep playing like this
10440,2020-12-13 02:28:30,kbkof3,Trey + jalen possible duo on the 2nd unit
10441,2020-12-13 02:28:59,kbkof3,willie trill diving hard to the basket. someone feed this man
10442,2020-12-13 02:30:56,kbkof3,Oh shit Willie
10443,2020-12-13 02:31:17,kbkof3,That defense from Green tho
10444,2020-12-13 02:32:04,kbkof3,Were a top 3 team in the west this season idc
10445,2020-12-13 02:33:34,kbkof3,Green looks so good on defense.
10446,2020-12-13 02:33:36,kbkof3,Hey Willie pull it back like 20%. I’m glad you’ve been working on the jumper but that’s a bad possession.
10447,2020-12-13 02:35:54,kbkof3,"Kleber seems to have giannis' number on defense ngl. He is strong enough that his ""signiture move"" of running thru a player dosnt really work"
10448,2020-12-13 02:37:03,kbkof3,maybe we need to flip our first and second line ups??
10449,2020-12-13 02:38:08,kbkof3,J. Green spot in rotation is pretty much lock in though Terry would have a hard time cracking up to the rotation this season.
10450,2020-12-13 02:38:10,kbkof3,Maxi looking great!
10451,2020-12-13 02:39:53,kbkof3,Nasty pass by JB!
10452,2020-12-13 02:40:44,kbkof3,"Green reminds me so much of Gary Harris, just such a smart cutter"
10453,2020-12-13 02:40:57,kbkof3,Mavs are filled to the brim with underrated pgs
10454,2020-12-13 02:41:08,kbkof3,"Green moves really well on defense so far. He can definitely find a place on the offense through cuts, but I hope he can develop a shot as well. He doesn't look like a complete rookie out there today, even when guarding Middleton."
10455,2020-12-13 02:41:36,kbkof3,I’m kind of bummed that we probably we won’t see Terry a lot this season barring injury.
10456,2020-12-13 02:43:36,kbkof3,"trying to think of a better back up back court than the Killer B’s, can’t think of anyone"

10462,2020-12-13 02:46:59,kbkof3,I will never understand how that fade-away hook by Boban is that wet but fuck it.
10463,2020-12-13 02:47:09,kbkof3,Look at that hustle
10464,2020-12-13 02:47:17,kbkof3,Hinton's rebounding transferring over.
10465,2020-12-13 02:48:14,kbkof3,Holy shit our rookies are DOING WORK

10473,2020-12-13 02:51:48,kbkof3,Hinton plays much more confidently while Tyler Terry takes quick shots that went missing with bad timing probably due to being over excited.
10474,2020-12-13 02:53:02,kbkof3,"If Hinton makes the team, that means someone else has to go. So if you want him on the team, who’s spot is he taking? It’s basically Iwundu or Bey as far I can tell, that could maaaaaybe be replaced by him."

10481,2020-12-13 03:01:40,kbkof3,Just let Boban run iso at the perimeter the rest of the game
10482,2020-12-13 03:01:55,kbkof3,Terry's gonna have to bulk up or he's gonna have a hard time doing anything other than shooting 3s.

10484,2020-12-13 03:02:51,kbkof3,Like the bench guys sharing the ball. Not playing selfish that I can see.

10498,2020-12-13 03:16:25,kbkof3,Oh yeah Tyrell!
10499,2020-12-13 03:16:28,kbkof3,Haha love the guys cheering that Terry charge
10500,2020-12-13 03:19:40,kbkof3,bey said nah
10501,2020-12-13 03:23:33,kbkof3,pog
10502,2020-12-13 04:10:22,kbkof3,Giannis gone
10503,2020-12-13 01:34:28,kbkof3,Josh greens off ball movement is crispy so far
10504,2020-12-12 07:41:22,kbkof3,I can't wait to see these rookies. I've also never been this excited to watch our teams defense.
10505,2020-12-13 01:10:05,kbkof3,LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOO IM SO HYYYYPED
10506,2020-12-13 01:17:36,kbkof3,Jesus I immediately thought that was a leg injury...thank God he just caught one to the head.
10507,2020-12-13 01:22:26,kbkof3,Is it just me or Luka looks chunkier than last season
10508,2020-12-13 01:31:38,kbkof3,Rick snapped his fingers and starting 5 disappeared lmao
10509,2020-12-13 01:43:32,kbkof3,Mavs have a habit of taking capable secondary ballhandlers and parking them in the corner for most of their minutes. Hope they don't continue that with Josh Richardson and James Johnson.
10510,2020-12-13 01:58:24,kbkof3,It's crazy that Powell looks the same.
10511,2020-12-13 01:59:45,kbkof3,Dwight Powell still cant defend
10512,2020-12-13 02:56:26,kbkof3,Why does it look like iwundu and delon wright have the same type of game
10513,2020-12-13 03:06:25,kbkof3,"Tyler bey, josh green and nate hinton look good. Tyrell terry is going to take some time."
10514,2020-12-13 03:13:39,kbkof3,Not sold on Gillespie and Patterson.
10515,2020-12-13 02:06:21,kbkof3,Luka looks out of shape lol
10516,2020-12-12 13:01:37,kbkof3,Do you guys think Luka and giannis/middleton will play?
10517,2020-12-12 16:32:28,kbkof3,"I wake up for Mavs games frequently, but 2 am for a preseason warm-up is just not worth it. I'll starve myself for Luka and the gang a few weeks more and then the graveyard shift is on!"
10518,2020-12-12 20:33:26,kbkof3,"The best thing about this team is I don’t care who’s playing I’m excited to see them all. Unlike last year where we had JJax, Delon, Josh Reeves and Antonious Cleveland who aren’t particularly exciting to watch imo, top to bottom excited to see everyone, especially the rookies. 

I honestly think we have a good chance at a WCF appearance. I think James Johnson is gonna do a lot more than what people expect, on and off the court."
10519,2020-12-13 01:14:29,kbkof3,Jrich scored mavs first points! Who would have thought lol
10520,2020-12-13 01:15:00,kbkof3,josh richardson three
10521,2020-12-13 01:19:57,kbkof3,Lmao Middleton
10522,2020-12-13 01:20:09,kbkof3,Happy Giannis is ok
10523,2020-12-13 01:20:14,kbkof3,Thj chucking shots
10524,2020-12-13 01:20:40,kbkof3,Look a little rusty
10525,2020-12-13 01:20:49,kbkof3,lookin rusty af
10526,2020-12-13 01:21:12,kbkof3,Silas come back
10527,2020-12-13 01:22:35,kbkof3,Rim protection is non existent
10528,2020-12-13 01:22:36,kbkof3,This stream sucks ass
10529,2020-12-13 01:24:35,kbkof3,"That's exactly what Josh Richardson was brought here to do, that play got me hyped."
10530,2020-12-13 01:24:48,kbkof3,Our offense is so sloppy but credit to the Bucks tho. Their defense seems pretty intense already
10531,2020-12-13 01:26:07,kbkof3,Spacing on the offense looking WHACK. Forcing Luka to take some terrible shots because of how much we're bunched up
10532,2020-12-13 01:26:09,kbkof3,Damn THj was cold af
10533,2020-12-13 01:26:30,kbkof3,is there really only 4.8k people watching
10534,2020-12-13 01:26:55,kbkof3,Jrich looking nice so far
10535,2020-12-13 01:27:59,kbkof3,"They are looking like a bunch of guys just trying not to get hurt, very slow and lackadaisical on offence."
10536,2020-12-13 01:33:53,kbkof3,Dat ball movement.
10537,2020-12-13 01:35:43,kbkof3,"Man, I miss those JBrunson smart plays. Good to see him again!"
10538,2020-12-13 01:37:36,kbkof3,How can you rebound a make Harp? Lol
10539,2020-12-13 01:38:26,kbkof3,Someone told Burke they're still in the bubble
10540,2020-12-13 01:39:06,kbkof3,Hey everyone. Just joining in... Man this feels good. I love you all.
10541,2020-12-13 01:39:52,kbkof3,Some really great positives so far
10542,2020-12-13 01:41:30,kbkof3,the bucks put their starters in?? very un bud like
10543,2020-12-13 01:42:55,kbkof3,Thats a block? Aint no way
10544,2020-12-13 01:43:23,kbkof3,I’m loving Brunson so far.
10545,2020-12-13 01:43:55,kbkof3,"Definitely a charge there, he was set"
10546,2020-12-13 01:47:22,kbkof3,JJonhson Bucket!!!
10547,2020-12-13 01:54:05,kbkof3,Dude wtf was that ad with the old lady deadlifting? Bout to split her spine
10548,2020-12-13 01:54:40,kbkof3,damn that was nice luka
10549,2020-12-13 01:55:52,kbkof3,Oh no...the ankle 😐😐
10550,2020-12-13 01:57:26,kbkof3,"Silver lining about Powell: these misses are signs of rust, not diminished athletic ability"
10551,2020-12-13 01:57:36,kbkof3,Great pass Timmy!
10552,2020-12-13 01:58:08,kbkof3,"Man, I don't care about the score but I don't like getting pounded by Portis."
10553,2020-12-13 01:59:15,kbkof3,Josh
10554,2020-12-13 02:00:17,kbkof3,Uh oh the 3s ang droping
10555,2020-12-13 02:03:08,kbkof3,"Aggressive Luka unlocked, preseason shook"
10556,2020-12-13 02:04:45,kbkof3,If Giannis ever gets a good ft % the league is beyond fucked
10557,2020-12-13 02:05:53,kbkof3,Can do anything to luka bur cant even look at fucking giannis and it is only preseason lol
10558,2020-12-13 02:06:19,kbkof3,"defense overall looks solid and we gotta remember, its bloody giannis, few have been able to stop him, ever. So you cant expect too much"
10559,2020-12-13 02:18:53,kbkof3,what's the HT score guys ?
10560,2020-12-13 02:20:56,kbkof3,We missed a lot of layups but made a lot of 3s
10561,2020-12-13 02:27:10,kbkof3,Trey burke that’s the name
10562,2020-12-13 02:27:33,kbkof3,Fuck yeah the Bench Mob is back!
10563,2020-12-13 02:28:17,kbkof3,Bench mob led with Jalen looks NOICE!
10564,2020-12-13 02:28:24,kbkof3,Brunson and Burk = BB aka Buckets Boys!
10565,2020-12-13 02:28:42,kbkof3,Luka being out of shape may not be a bad thing as it will keep his minutes down to start the season.
10566,2020-12-13 02:30:01,kbkof3,Alright time for some nicknames for the Brunson and Burke duo. I’m thinking Brunserker mode.
10567,2020-12-13 02:30:26,kbkof3,Its going to be damn near impossible to keep Brunson long term. He is clearly good enough to be a starting PG in this league
10568,2020-12-13 02:30:27,kbkof3,Greeeeeeenie
10569,2020-12-13 02:30:43,kbkof3,WILLIE!!!
10570,2020-12-13 02:31:34,kbkof3,Willy Bucket!
10571,2020-12-13 02:32:14,kbkof3,I think I'm gonna get a green Green jersey by the end of the season
10572,2020-12-13 02:35:44,kbkof3,Giannis helping his future teammate up
10573,2020-12-13 02:36:07,kbkof3,"If this team plays defense this season, league is fucked."
10574,2020-12-13 02:36:09,kbkof3,Giannis helping Maxi get up <3
10575,2020-12-13 02:37:37,kbkof3,Giannis suffering from PTSD on that maxi roll haha
10576,2020-12-13 02:38:37,kbkof3, Somebody talked to Harp about calling everybody “special”. He’s expanded his vocabulary a little bit.
10577,2020-12-13 02:39:30,kbkof3,Josh Green needs to improve his chin beard.
10578,2020-12-13 02:39:42,kbkof3,greens defense tho
10579,2020-12-13 02:41:01,kbkof3,Bench looks great.
10580,2020-12-13 02:41:08,kbkof3,if thybulle plays for Aus as well we're gonna have such strong wings
10581,2020-12-13 02:45:34,kbkof3,Soft hand Boban
10582,2020-12-13 02:46:03,kbkof3,TT sighting
10583,2020-12-13 02:46:15,kbkof3,Finally! Terry- and Bobi 😄
10584,2020-12-13 02:47:09,kbkof3,Hustle play!!
10585,2020-12-13 02:47:33,kbkof3,Terry needa get on that Dwight Powell diet
10586,2020-12-13 02:47:50,kbkof3,Wet
10587,2020-12-13 02:48:08,kbkof3,Hinton is all over the court. He plays with a lot of effort
10588,2020-12-13 02:48:08,kbkof3,"I’m excited for Nate Hinton, love his activity on the boards."
10589,2020-12-13 02:48:37,kbkof3,"I know these minutes mean very little, but I really like Hinton’s effort here."
10590,2020-12-13 02:50:25,kbkof3,"Green, Bey, Hinton all looking pretty good so far"
10591,2020-12-13 02:53:08,kbkof3,Oh Ty should shave
10592,2020-12-13 02:53:12,kbkof3,BOBAN
10593,2020-12-13 02:54:06,kbkof3,"I've seen Terry bump into the screener a couple of times, once it was Boban, his own man lol protect him"
10594,2020-12-13 03:02:00,kbkof3,Starting to look like 3rd unit basketball these past couple minutes
10595,2020-12-13 03:02:18,kbkof3,This combination of Hinton and Iwundu >>>>
10596,2020-12-13 03:02:33,kbkof3,What is luka doncic doing in a bucks jersey?
10597,2020-12-13 03:02:46,kbkof3,Ok rooks!!
10598,2020-12-13 03:10:34,kbkof3,who the hell is this patterson dude lmfao
10599,2020-12-13 03:14:37,kbkof3,There is never a boring game with the Mavericks.
10600,2020-12-13 03:15:00,kbkof3,NATE MUTHERFUCKIN HINTON
10601,2020-12-13 03:15:02,kbkof3,"It's too early for Terry to helm and offense, I'd like to see him next to Brunson."
10602,2020-12-13 03:15:04,kbkof3,How is Hinton so good? where did he come from again?
10603,2020-12-13 03:15:09,kbkof3,This season will be about depth way more than other years. I like our chances.
10604,2020-12-13 03:15:13,kbkof3,"Nate ""Nate Hinton"" Hinton"
10605,2020-12-13 03:15:30,kbkof3,Nate Hinton is gonna have a place in this league with his hustle. The offense is bonus
10606,2020-12-13 01:29:36,kbkof3,"I will not rush to judge Luka here, he looks.... uninterested at best"
10607,2020-12-13 01:09:33,kbkof3,"Gonna tamper my expectations this season.

That being said, Luka for Defensive POY, Richardson for MIP, Terry for ROY, and 72-0."
10608,2020-12-13 01:29:59,kbkof3,I'm going to miss seeing Curry with the headband and undershirt just  waiting to bury 3s
10609,2020-12-13 01:34:26,kbkof3,That was clean by green
10610,2020-12-13 02:00:07,kbkof3,JRich scorchin hot with the 3!
10611,2020-12-13 02:03:37,kbkof3,"Ok, is it just me or is the fake crowd unnecessarily louder at the most random times?"
10612,2020-12-13 03:13:30,kbkof3,"Hinton bey and iwundu we need them

Terry is a bit eh today"
10613,2020-12-13 03:14:07,kbkof3,"Not liking Tyrell Terry’s body language at all. Isnt helping isnt really making an effort at all. Looks like he doesnt wanna be out there.

Literally the first game but I hope he figures it out. This is the one thing I really wish Barea was still there for. He could’ve took him under his wing."
10614,2020-12-13 00:46:03,kbkof3,"Dear fellow MKG islanders, we may have lost our home island but fear not, for tonight we inhibit the IWUNDU ISLAND!"
10615,2020-12-13 01:05:33,kbkof3,Mavs.com stream is LIVE
10616,2020-12-13 01:09:50,kbkof3,Mavs.com stream is surprisingly solid. HD and I was able to throw it up on my chromecast off my mobile chrome browser
10617,2020-12-13 01:15:43,kbkof3,Ball movement is nice but we gotta help out Luka to get him out of those double teams
10618,2020-12-13 01:16:56,kbkof3,Oh Noe Giannis!
10619,2020-12-13 01:17:14,kbkof3,WhAt happened to giannis
10620,2020-12-13 01:28:17,kbkof3,luka looking ruuuuusty
10621,2020-12-13 01:31:41,kbkof3,Why does Brunson look so old hahah
10622,2020-12-13 01:34:42,kbkof3,Green looks comfortable out there. Doesn’t move like a rookie
10623,2020-12-13 02:00:22,kbkof3,Doncic - Dwight connection hasn't changed one bit
10624,2020-12-13 02:50:52,kbkof3,The rookie we all wanted to see the most (terry) is actually doing the worst lol. The rest of them look great
10625,2020-12-12 15:03:49,kbkof3,6:30 am IST! Most Mavs games are at this time!
10626,2020-12-12 17:27:03,kbkof3,Really hope we get to see at least 10 or so minutes of Terry and a bit of Bey.
10627,2020-12-13 01:13:58,kbkof3,Good to see Powell trying to jump there
10628,2020-12-13 01:14:03,kbkof3,Common THJ
10629,2020-12-13 01:14:24,kbkof3,giannis with one of the ugliest pull ups i’ve ever seen
10630,2020-12-13 01:20:08,kbkof3,Great to see Dwight back on the court
10631,2020-12-13 01:20:53,kbkof3,The passing is so beautiful
10632,2020-12-13 01:20:55,kbkof3,"Three airballs, a dunk blocked by the rim, two gimme layups.  Not the best basketball I've ever seen!"
10633,2020-12-13 01:21:11,kbkof3,Yeah I'd rather THJ shake off the rust now when it doesn't count for anything. Keep shooting Timmy
10634,2020-12-13 01:21:37,kbkof3,Pretty fucking excited to see the rookies in action
10635,2020-12-13 01:22:56,kbkof3,Okay that’s a fucking soft call.
10636,2020-12-13 01:24:43,kbkof3,jrich defense
10637,2020-12-13 01:25:27,kbkof3,JRich very active defensively.
10638,2020-12-13 01:26:33,kbkof3,Pretty much how i expected both teams to look after a truncated offseason and both teams played in the bubble. Like what i seen from Richardson so far tho
10639,2020-12-13 01:28:29,kbkof3,I hate these tough shots luka keeps taking. I know they're just trying stuff out so doubt it keeps going through regular season.
10640,2020-12-13 01:28:41,kbkof3,"Wait, Bryn Forbes is a buck now?"
10641,2020-12-13 01:30:42,kbkof3,Josh green sighting!
10642,2020-12-13 01:35:40,kbkof3,Why is josh green actually so small ? Doesn’t look bigger than Brunson
10643,2020-12-13 01:38:18,kbkof3,Burke!
10644,2020-12-13 01:38:21,kbkof3,1st quarter was hella rough
10645,2020-12-13 01:38:41,kbkof3,It’s preseason
10646,2020-12-13 01:38:58,kbkof3,"trey burke, he did that"
10647,2020-12-13 01:39:02,kbkof3,Players looking so cold. Bench unit seems fun tho.
10648,2020-12-13 01:39:08,kbkof3,DAMMIT TREY! Mavs 3rd Star lmao
10649,2020-12-13 01:39:48,kbkof3,This is why preseason is important. So we can freak out over any inconsistencies and go into a doom spiral
10650,2020-12-13 01:40:40,kbkof3,If anyone needs a link I got you! Helping all my mffl
10651,2020-12-13 01:51:53,kbkof3,Brunson for 6 moty and Burke for most improved
10652,2020-12-13 01:55:23,kbkof3,THJ has the Christmas badge on
10653,2020-12-13 01:55:32,kbkof3,"I'm feeling frustrated with THJ, but I was early in the last season, so I'm sure it's fine."
10654,2020-12-13 01:55:35,kbkof3,THJ is a chucker lmao
10655,2020-12-13 01:55:46,kbkof3,Why isnt this game om fssw?  They're showing ou highlights haha
10656,2020-12-13 02:21:36,kbkof3,Are starters playing second half?
10657,2020-12-13 02:23:57,kbkof3,"I know Kristaps said that he thought his recovery was going better than expected but I haven't heard any definitive source if he will be ready for the Christmas game or before the New Year. 

I assume the timetable hasn't changed and he'll debut in January. Is that correct?"
10658,2020-12-13 02:25:39,kbkof3,Love what holiday added to his game; trucking people commiting offensive fouls
10659,2020-12-13 02:26:46,kbkof3,"I was sitting here overreacting, as I will, during the first quarter worried about the team this year. Then I remembered we have KP. Feeling good about this team."
10660,2020-12-13 02:27:03,kbkof3,Threeeeee
10661,2020-12-13 02:27:07,kbkof3,It's raining bucket guys. :D
10662,2020-12-13 02:27:24,kbkof3,"Our offense is looking lethal.

Now we just need to have competent defense to close out games and then we're contenders."
10663,2020-12-13 02:27:25,kbkof3,green quietly playing some real good defense
10664,2020-12-13 02:28:00,kbkof3,"Man our second unit is awesome.
BrunsonBurke"
10665,2020-12-13 02:28:29,kbkof3,"Man, Willy is sure....giving it his all....

Has he ever rolled hard to the rim in his entire career?"
10666,2020-12-13 02:30:52,kbkof3,That was a really nice pass from Green
10667,2020-12-13 02:31:07,kbkof3,"Josh Green guarding Middleton, looking real good!"
10668,2020-12-13 02:31:07,kbkof3,Nice handles by the rook

10674,2020-12-13 02:33:31,kbkof3,Good pass giannis
10675,2020-12-13 02:33:41,kbkof3,"Dude if Willie pulls this shit much longer Rick will glue him to the bench. Legitimately. I want him to work out, but it’s the same shit as always. He wants to be a finesse scorer and doesn’t play with intensity."
10676,2020-12-13 02:34:34,kbkof3,uuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh
10677,2020-12-13 02:34:42,kbkof3,The starters are done for the night?
10678,2020-12-13 02:34:44,kbkof3,Giannis cant score on MAXI
10679,2020-12-13 02:35:19,kbkof3,Yikes

10683,2020-12-13 02:43:44,kbkof3,Green has done a good job a couple of times swiping at Giannis causing a bad play from him.
10684,2020-12-13 02:44:10,kbkof3,Stupid challenge
10685,2020-12-13 02:56:49,kbkof3,This team already lookin a little differennnnt

10692,2020-12-13 03:13:53,kbkof3,Definitely tougher to score on offense for the newbies without the screening and easy dump offs that is the Great Wall of Boban.
10693,2020-12-13 03:14:58,kbkof3,Hinton looks like the truth

No lift. Going to be a long season with the West being deep."
10733,2020-12-13 01:31:38,kbkof3,I could only find a Bucks stream and the commentators are soooo boring...
10734,2020-12-13 01:40:13,kbkof3,"I think Dodo ruined our chance at Giannis lol, He looks shook after taking that hit"
10735,2020-12-13 00:12:06,kbkof3,Very excited to see our new players specially the rooks! Let's go Mavs!
10736,2020-12-13 00:54:22,kbkof3,BOBI SIGHTING
10737,2020-12-13 01:02:46,kbkof3,Bang Bang szn starts now
10738,2020-12-13 01:02:54,kbkof3,"Mavs website stream doesn't work? It requests name and email, I entered that info hit submit and nothing happens."
10739,2020-12-13 01:03:46,kbkof3,Thanks for sharing the stream link. I was wondering how I can watch the game.
10740,2020-12-13 01:04:58,kbkof3,So is signed up for League Pass and I have a blackout because it's streaming on Mavs.com? Am I doing something wrong?
10741,2020-12-13 01:15:45,kbkof3,[J](https://J.Rich)Rich Bucket!!!
10742,2020-12-13 01:16:46,kbkof3,Didn’t look to bad praying that’s nothing serious. okay he good.
10743,2020-12-13 01:22:51,kbkof3,"I was going to make a post about this earlier, but I do worry about a THJ regression this year. I trust that last year he was so great because of the looks Luka gave him, and I hope that continues, but something about relying on him repeating career high’s in shooting just doesn’t feel great to me"
10744,2020-12-13 01:32:31,kbkof3,JB is actually really good with dribble penetration. Need to use it more this year
10745,2020-12-13 01:33:27,kbkof3,That was some ball movement clinic
10746,2020-12-13 01:33:24,kbkof3,Yikes.
10747,2020-12-13 01:33:47,kbkof3,Giannis is going to destroy this second unit.
10748,2020-12-13 00:25:22,kbkof3,"Mavericks > Bucks

For anyone who doesn't have cable TV check [https://streambible.org/streams/basketball/](https://streambible.org/streams/basketball/) for possible streams they tend to work few minutes after game starts."
10749,2020-12-13 01:28:40,kbkof3,"Luka has not improved on his weaknesses. Still passing up conceded, open 3s and jacking contested, step-back bricks seemingly at random. Also chirping refs after everything they do or don’t do and not getting back on D. Love him. Top-3 offensive player and top-10 overall player no doubt. But not gonna win MVP and will start to be heavily criticized by the national media for bad shooting and shot selection. 

Just saying.

Also Powell is clearly cooked. Can’t jump. His effectiveness offensively will depend on how much defenses close out on him.

Edit: lol y’all don’t be so predictable; also, check out the book *Blink* by Malcolm Gladwell. It argues that there’s a lot of insight to be gleaned from first impressions."
10750,2020-12-13 02:00:22,kbkof3,Lmao that was a low IQ pass by Luka thankfully Richardson made the 3.
10751,2020-12-13 03:06:35,kbkof3,"After the Draft i was thinking like Green > Terry > Bey > Iwundu > Hinton

After tonight i changed my mind to Hinton > Bey > Iwundu > Terry > Green"
10752,2020-12-13 01:49:22,kbkof3,"Ngl, imma say it rn Green is gonna be a bust. As much of a bust as you can be for an 18th pick. I just wanna see Terry in"
10753,2020-12-13 07:27:42,kbkof3,Yup! Team chemistry looks really good
10754,2020-12-13 03:20:47,kbkof3,Merely for the tradition of undrafted guys doing well here
10755,2020-12-13 03:20:53,kbkof3,Lower tier of college play apparently
10756,2020-12-13 04:04:24,kbkof3,So we can get him on a 2 way.
10757,2020-12-13 02:30:22,kbkof3,And the second unit. We have so many balanced pieces now.
10758,2020-12-13 01:44:49,kbkof3,Not hard to look better than him tbh
10759,2020-12-13 01:45:23,kbkof3,He’s way more agile than I thought he would be from watching his AZ film. Don’t want to get too excited but he may have been a great pick.
10760,2020-12-13 01:47:56,kbkof3,That's not a high threshold
10761,2020-12-13 02:40:22,kbkof3,YES
10762,2020-12-13 01:18:24,kbkof3,Tim is like the opposite of Luka. Luka comes blazing straight out of the gate where Timmy takes a while to consistently hit his shot
10763,2020-12-13 02:56:25,kbkof3,Lmao very that
10764,2020-12-13 02:58:56,kbkof3,The infamous 7 step traveler himself.
10765,2020-12-13 04:03:50,kbkof3,He gone.
10766,2020-12-13 02:45:21,kbkof3,Haha that's exactly what I said to my roommate
10767,2020-12-13 03:24:10,kbkof3,He was one of the best rebounders in all of college last year and it fucking shows
10768,2020-12-12 23:23:44,kbkof3,I feel like it's been ages when it's only been a little over 3 months.
10769,2020-12-12 07:23:07,kbkof3,Actualy it's 2 am...CEST is summer time
10770,2020-12-12 07:15:18,kbkof3,Good thing it's a weekend!
10771,2020-12-13 03:19:58,kbkof3,They blocked his shot when there was a foul and he was just trying to get some practice in so he took that personally lol.
10772,2020-12-13 07:35:07,kbkof3,"Yeah, he looked surprisingly comfortable playing on the wing. He just needs to have his 3pt shot down to keep defenses honest.

In order to play towards his strengths, I can seem him playing on one of the corner 3's, cutting along the baseline to get inside."
10773,2020-12-13 01:49:54,kbkof3,Ball movement!
10774,2020-12-13 01:18:52,kbkof3,Ok I lol'd 😂😂
10775,2020-12-13 01:25:15,kbkof3,Lmaoooo
10776,2020-12-13 02:36:10,kbkof3,Kleber defense  >>> Powell defense
10777,2020-12-13 08:07:39,kbkof3,Um Powell is not and has never been even an average level defender. Which says something given he’s athletic and definitely hustles. Just no defensive IQ he cannot make reads at all and has zero anticipatory skills. Obviously he has an average wingspan and not great laterals which doesn’t help either
10778,2020-12-13 02:43:03,kbkof3,They are both better defenders period
10779,2020-12-13 02:03:48,kbkof3,Giannis bullies almost everyone to be fair
10780,2020-12-13 02:03:46,kbkof3,maxi was the better match up last year so i expect that (in rick we trust) during the actual season
10781,2020-12-13 02:03:15,kbkof3,What a surprise
10782,2020-12-13 02:03:54,kbkof3,"Not sure why, Powell is a strong and athletic dude. Get in his path."
10783,2020-12-13 02:54:35,kbkof3,Lmaooo
10784,2020-12-13 07:41:10,kbkof3,"Wild and funny take.
Hinton looks to be a great glue guy, which we hoped delon would be for us. 

I am impressed with Hinton's motor. I think he might be cracking the rotation by the end of this year."
10785,2020-12-13 02:50:49,kbkof3,Brunson/Burke is the new JJB/Harris badass bench guard combo.
10786,2020-12-13 01:53:02,kbkof3,Wild lol
10787,2020-12-13 02:43:16,kbkof3,"Called for the oop, i like the enthusiasm"
10788,2020-12-13 02:44:48,kbkof3,"See, I feel like I’ve seen the exact opposite. He’s playing like he wants to be someone he’s not. He wants to shoot and handle the ball. He needs to set big screens, roll hard and play defense. He’s not rolling hard and his defense has been soft. He looks the same as he’s always looked his entire career. Tantalizing and incredibly frustrating."
10789,2020-12-13 03:07:12,kbkof3,Shot looks nice. Defensive effort is good. Just needs time to become a real PG. He could do some things in a few minutes with Brunson or Luka on the floor.
10790,2020-12-13 03:13:47,kbkof3,Out here snagging those rebounds
10791,2020-12-13 05:31:05,kbkof3,It was an accident and there was no ill feeling during or after
10792,2020-12-13 02:14:19,kbkof3,He looked pretty skinny going into his sophomore season.
10793,2020-12-13 02:20:02,kbkof3,Its like they didn't see Harden in the bubble. Dude looked like my uncle Don on Thanksgiving night.
10794,2020-12-13 02:21:14,kbkof3,"I honestly think he comes in with a little extra so that when he inevitably shaves some off throughout the season, he'll still be a solid size. Part of Luka's skillset is being built like a lineman. It allows him to bully smaller defenders and battle down low. It's so dumb some people just haven't understood this trend with him to start the year."
10795,2020-12-13 02:16:13,kbkof3,Well said. I don't understand why there are still people who talk down Luka. How much more does he have to do to prove that he's the real deal to these haters?
10796,2020-12-13 02:22:18,kbkof3,"I think people are saying it’s relatable. Many of us put on pounds during covid and resting and chilling, It’s good for the body to rest and for Luka to get down time. I don’t see any problem with it. For me, I just see him more relatable"
10797,2020-12-13 02:21:56,kbkof3,he didnt look out of shape going into sophomore at all
10798,2020-12-13 01:33:34,kbkof3,"Forreal, these people should be called out. Pathetic ""supporters"""
10799,2020-12-13 01:35:20,kbkof3,"you’re not wrong. but we are used to basically perfect luka, so hard to see him miss stuff he normally hits, even if it is preseason"
10800,2020-12-13 06:10:29,kbkof3,Relax. It was a really short off season and he's young.  He'll play into shape real quick and he'll be fine when the season starts.
10801,2020-12-13 01:47:03,kbkof3,Burke is first right?
10802,2020-12-13 01:48:58,kbkof3,Isn't Wes better than Burke?   People forget about him and DAJ.
10803,2020-12-13 02:11:42,kbkof3,yes
10804,2020-12-13 02:49:59,kbkof3,Except dwight
10805,2020-12-13 02:50:40,kbkof3,We are deep... and i love it
10806,2020-12-13 03:04:07,kbkof3,The stabilizing force of our team!
10807,2020-12-13 03:13:30,kbkof3,Undersized guards take a while to get acclimated. Trae was ass the first half of his rookie year.
10808,2020-12-13 03:13:39,kbkof3,Yeah Terry needs to bulk up before he tries to start driving.
10809,2020-12-13 07:30:08,kbkof3,"Nah, he's at least another year or two away from contributing in that role. But its all gravy, since it was a flyer of a pick and we knew he wasn't going to be ready"
10810,2020-12-13 01:48:11,kbkof3,Looks like Josh Green is already too. I love Jackson the person but it’s so nice seeing some aggressive play in that spot.
10811,2020-12-13 01:53:07,kbkof3,"He looks good in the motion offense, just a bit hesitant when he's attacking the rim which is a given since its his first game but he looks good"
10812,2020-12-13 01:54:17,kbkof3,I wasn’t expecting to see much else from him offensively this year aside from some catch and shoot threes but it’s encouraging to see that!
10813,2020-12-13 02:40:43,kbkof3,I think there were a few guys in the league who shot horribly all bubble along w a few who went crazy.
10814,2020-12-13 02:44:00,kbkof3,He won’t play Giannis more than 30 minutes for the rest of the season.
10815,2020-12-13 02:44:53,kbkof3,Bud overcorrecting to criticism of his rotations by overplaying his starters in a meaningless preseason game
10816,2020-12-13 02:44:07,kbkof3,Bud heard r/nba saying he doesnt play Giannis more
10817,2020-12-13 03:17:55,kbkof3,No two alike!
10818,2020-12-13 06:09:17,kbkof3,"UH guy here.  He is also a glue guy.  The guy is a winner.  Rebounds EVERYTHING (Kelvin Sampson), money mid range, and a good garbage man when you consider his 6'5"" size.  His shot from distance still needs work, but the dude has a work ethic that goes on for ages.  Defense = physical AF (see Kelvin Sampson)"
10819,2020-12-12 22:50:20,kbkof3,"And James Johnson punch somebody, just a little bit"
10820,2020-12-13 02:19:50,kbkof3,If theres any games I want him to rant to the refs its preseason games.
10821,2020-12-13 02:10:04,kbkof3,Im pretty sure he is above avrage in FT% already
10822,2020-12-13 02:47:07,kbkof3,It’s his catchphrase at this point
10823,2020-12-13 02:47:32,kbkof3,Ye Luka was going crazy after that Boban shot
10824,2020-12-13 02:57:18,kbkof3,How else are we going to round into mid-season form?
10825,2020-12-13 03:07:01,kbkof3,Hinton won’t be able to be on the team unless they cut someone else.
10826,2020-12-13 04:46:27,kbkof3,It’s one preseason game lol
10827,2020-12-13 04:45:02,kbkof3,He played like that in college too. He’s usually always playing within the flow of the game. He needs more confidence.
10828,2020-12-12 19:00:58,kbkof3,I'm missing my wife's birthday party to watch! 😀
10829,2020-12-13 01:38:08,kbkof3,"Little bit sloppy, but he's doing all the right things."
10830,2020-12-13 01:39:57,kbkof3,"Definitly. Makes sense as well, the regulars dont need to impress anyway. Luka for example always had trubble playing in non competitive games it seems, same with all stars, he takes it almost too easy"
10831,2020-12-13 01:44:39,kbkof3,powell is huge! so glad he looks quick
10832,2020-12-13 01:47:26,kbkof3,Very underrated.
10833,2020-12-13 02:26:25,kbkof3,To get a look at his next bench.
10834,2020-12-13 02:38:52,kbkof3,rip
10835,2020-12-13 02:40:28,kbkof3,I think his offense looks pretty good because he's cutting aggressively and moving the ball well. The shots will get better with time.
10836,2020-12-13 02:47:51,kbkof3,Did you mean Boban “NBA shut down the 2020 regular season the day he was unleashed” Marjanovic?
10837,2020-12-13 02:48:50,kbkof3,Hinton also has handles. Bey looks like a shooter. Green was looking good. Damn we really got some good players.
10838,2020-12-13 02:52:50,kbkof3,"Injuries, players returning from injuries, Covid, and matchups I'm sure everyone will get a good chance at playing."
10839,2020-12-13 02:55:09,kbkof3,I’d like to officially join the Nate Hinton stan club.
10840,2020-12-13 03:04:37,kbkof3,Looks solid.
10841,2020-12-13 03:06:13,kbkof3,He has a good midrange and decent 3
10842,2020-12-13 03:18:15,kbkof3,"broke records in multiple basketball iq tests for multiple gms apparently, hes a smart guy"
10843,2020-12-12 09:52:59,kbkof3,"Sorry, will keep that in mind."
10844,2020-12-12 07:31:35,kbkof3,That's what i said...
10845,2020-12-12 09:39:32,kbkof3,I actually hope for Maxi+DP to start since I am hoping that they will form our bench big duo for the bulk of the season.
10846,2020-12-13 00:29:38,kbkof3,"Also the team probably wants to feature him in case they need to trade Dwight down the road.  Sooner Dwight looks like his old self, the more likely they will be to include his name in trade offers."
10847,2020-12-13 01:44:08,kbkof3,Refs in mid-season form
10848,2020-12-13 02:05:09,kbkof3,"Kleber / James Johnson did it fine.

Powell cant guard anyone really, even before the injury."
10849,2020-12-13 02:05:44,kbkof3,Not many do
10850,2020-12-13 02:05:14,kbkof3,"I would like to see James Johnson give it a go, but no team has that guy who can cover Gannis really. That’s why he is two time MVP."
10851,2020-12-13 02:19:58,kbkof3,Giannis is steam rolling this team. The only solution is to foul and hope he misses at the line
10852,2020-12-13 02:32:55,kbkof3,Nah we need that. He spaces the floor with his shot
10853,2020-12-13 02:43:46,kbkof3,Mavericks legend Josh Richardson? Me too.
10854,2020-12-13 02:49:59,kbkof3,Dude was an incredible rebounder in college and it shows
10855,2020-12-13 02:51:41,kbkof3,"kind of matched with his highlight tape, so glad to see it’s translating to the NBA level"
10856,2020-12-13 02:51:25,kbkof3,He's the boss's kid you have to play and just let put up shots.
10857,2020-12-13 03:05:54,kbkof3,Dude yes lol I was trying to think of a good name for this lineup!
10858,2020-12-13 03:12:56,kbkof3,*put on weight
10859,2020-12-13 03:16:04,kbkof3,They said they are going to announce all 15 players will be able to dress out for the full season in the next few days.
10860,2020-12-13 03:30:31,kbkof3,Looked like thj stepped on his shoe or something
10861,2020-12-13 03:28:59,kbkof3,He’s signed to a 2 way contract
10862,2020-12-13 02:56:32,kbkof3,"He's gonna get beat up on screens cause of his size, but his on ball and help side defense has looked pretty solid. The effort is there."
10863,2020-12-13 02:57:39,kbkof3,"Yeah, watching his D... that's how he can stay on the court."
10864,2020-12-13 01:43:38,kbkof3,And J. Rich looks like what we hoped delon would be
10865,2020-12-13 01:42:58,kbkof3,Pretty much
10866,2020-12-13 02:29:44,kbkof3,How did no team steal him..
10867,2020-12-13 02:28:45,kbkof3,He plays with such a high motor. It pops off the screen
10868,2020-12-13 02:29:07,kbkof3,Because he does a lot of small things well.
10869,2020-12-13 02:37:57,kbkof3,Obviously only one preseason game in but he looks fantastic on that end. It's why high motor prospects are almost always worth the gamble. You are always gonna get all out effort
10870,2020-12-13 02:41:38,kbkof3,Nate Hinton dunks on Giannis
10871,2020-12-13 02:41:49,kbkof3,"I actually think he playing nervous
Overpassing and he needs to learn how to navigate ball screens"
10872,2020-12-13 02:42:22,kbkof3,Love it
10873,2020-12-13 02:43:06,kbkof3,"here, i’ll help start it!"
10874,2020-12-13 02:46:59,kbkof3,With a shoe deal for Nike Air BnBs haha
10875,2020-12-13 05:56:49,kbkof3,Perfection!
10876,2020-12-13 02:51:12,kbkof3,Great comparison. I was saying this on other posts when we got him. His effort is unmatched.
10877,2020-12-13 03:03:07,kbkof3,I would’ve called you crazy before I watched him this game. How is he always in the right place at the right time?
10878,2020-12-13 03:13:52,kbkof3,"Hinton looked better than all the kids except Green, maybe."
10879,2020-12-13 03:17:38,kbkof3,He's coming off an MCL sprain so they're still easing him into it. Rick said he wanted 8-10 minutes from him tonight and that's what he got.
10880,2020-12-13 03:18:51,kbkof3,They probably see him as a lock 2nd team and don't want to try anything iffy.
10881,2020-12-13 03:17:29,kbkof3,Because he's a vet and doesnt need the time
10882,2020-12-13 02:05:16,kbkof3,We were hoping that he's come back in even better shape :/
10883,2020-12-13 03:32:50,kbkof3,Lamelo 0 Points. Looks like wiseman is not going to see any play.
10884,2020-12-13 03:20:40,kbkof3,Y'all gotta stop. Green was great tonight.
10885,2020-12-13 03:28:53,kbkof3,"Green played against starters and regular rotation guys, he's gotta be on the top"
10886,2020-12-13 03:23:04,kbkof3,"To be fair, he was absolutely surrounded in the paint. He probably should have just stayed outside of the paint if possible."
10887,2020-12-13 01:35:32,kbkof3,He should be in shape now
10888,2020-12-13 01:43:44,kbkof3,Gonna be very hard to keep him going forward. He can be a starter in this league
10889,2020-12-13 01:43:47,kbkof3,learning from someone like JJ had to be great for him. he’s very cerebral
10890,2020-12-13 02:12:33,kbkof3,so inpirational
10891,2020-12-13 02:11:35,kbkof3,I'm legitimately shocked how comfortable Powell looks out there. You'd never guess he's coming off an Achilles injury
10892,2020-12-13 02:35:49,kbkof3,The opposite
10893,2020-12-13 02:35:05,kbkof3,Never forget his playoff cold streak
10894,2020-12-13 02:41:56,kbkof3,"Maxi, Jalen, Trey, Boban, Powell, the rookies, and James Johnson will
Be a problem with Luka/THJ/Josh/DFS/KP starting"
10895,2020-12-13 02:50:16,kbkof3,That's optimistic
10896,2020-12-13 02:46:19,kbkof3,Yep. #14.
10897,2020-12-13 02:52:21,kbkof3,"No, we are not. It's literally why we cut JJ."
10898,2020-12-13 02:52:43,kbkof3,Huh? We are maxed out so we have our squad set. Unless a better player becomes available.
10899,2020-12-13 03:07:24,kbkof3,He has to crack the roster first.
10900,2020-12-13 03:14:13,kbkof3,I kinda thought Bernard James too
10901,2020-12-13 03:17:49,kbkof3,Except the Texas Legends aren’t participating in the G League this year. He’ll just ride the bench for a while.
10902,2020-12-13 04:13:09,kbkof3,Damn I guess your just not gonna use any of those dots or commas huh
10903,2020-12-13 02:13:42,kbkof3,I say we get Dr. Greg Doucette to work with him for an offseason lol
10904,2020-12-13 01:06:58,kbkof3,Same
10905,2020-12-13 01:08:43,kbkof3,works for me
10906,2020-12-13 01:10:43,kbkof3,I had the same problem but when I zoomed my screen to 150% it allowed me to click full screen
10907,2020-12-13 01:14:13,kbkof3,"Was able to do it by right clicking the player, choosing to show only that frame, and then the full screen button could be clicked (using Firefox)"
10908,2020-12-12 20:53:07,kbkof3,Yup. He confirmed it in his media day interviews
10909,2020-12-13 02:23:15,kbkof3,He had the same problem last year. He's not a great defender against actual bigs.
10910,2020-12-13 02:39:52,kbkof3,Luka’s clearly a bench player at this point.
10911,2020-12-13 02:49:16,kbkof3,Looking great
10912,2020-12-13 02:55:45,kbkof3,I think Iwundu will be sent home but I don't like having to send anyone home :/
10913,2020-12-13 02:56:57,kbkof3,WCS and just suffer until KP comes back lol
10914,2020-12-13 02:57:33,kbkof3,Hinton and Bey are 2 way guys. Iwundu Is a guaranteed contract so cutting either one doesn't effect the other.
10915,2020-12-13 02:57:46,kbkof3,He's already a two-way player. So is Bey. No need to cut into somebodies roster spot.
10916,2020-12-13 02:57:53,kbkof3,I think he stays as is this season and we get him a roster spot next year.
10917,2020-12-13 02:59:21,kbkof3,Yes. 100%
10918,2020-12-13 01:17:57,kbkof3,Same instant relief when I saw the replay.
10919,2020-12-13 01:23:06,kbkof3,Imo he looks slimmer
10920,2020-12-13 01:24:16,kbkof3,"I think he looks much thicker. He had less than two weeks to get ready, so it’ll fall off. But he does look extra thiccc to me"
10921,2020-12-13 01:26:21,kbkof3,"He's wearing the under shirt which he wore in his rookie season when he was thicker, so I think he knows as well. It'll fall off pretty quick though throughout the pre season and training camp."
10922,2020-12-13 01:59:32,kbkof3,"I think he's lost some standstill vertical explosion, saw it on some of the lob attempts earlier. but encouraging that he's mostly the same."
10923,2020-12-13 02:03:16,kbkof3,"No he really doesn’t. 


He used to jump at the ball with hyper energy on every play.  Almost like a bull in a China shop sometimes with all that energy. 

He might have the same energy but it’s staying on the floor for the most part now"
10924,2020-12-13 02:57:10,kbkof3,I hope thats not the case
10925,2020-12-13 02:58:51,kbkof3,"Delon could shoot. Lol. I think they’re just trying to let him experiment, obviously, but maybe there is such a thing as too much experimentation. He’s been looking to score, but he isn’t quite sure how to do it."
10926,2020-12-13 03:11:03,kbkof3,Needs to put on like 20 pounds of muscle
10927,2020-12-13 03:13:55,kbkof3,You don’t need to be
10928,2020-12-13 02:10:17,kbkof3,How so?
10929,2020-12-12 13:05:11,kbkof3,"They will, but probably limited minutes (like 15-ish)."
10930,2020-12-12 19:07:39,kbkof3,I'm not waking up either but I'll watch it like I watch all games Luka plays.
10931,2020-12-13 00:41:03,kbkof3,You haven't seen any of our new players. We were excited for Jjax and Delon before last season.
10932,2020-12-13 01:26:55,kbkof3,"Rim protection exist, but it needed to repair meniscus."
10933,2020-12-13 01:57:53,kbkof3,What'd you see?
10934,2020-12-13 02:20:11,kbkof3,53-59 bucks
10935,2020-12-13 02:30:49,kbkof3,Air BnB?
10936,2020-12-13 02:36:23,kbkof3,No hes not
10937,2020-12-13 02:41:12,kbkof3,Loving how active he is.
10938,2020-12-13 03:11:58,kbkof3,"not making the team, just filler"
10939,2020-12-13 03:15:29,kbkof3,Houston
10940,2020-12-13 01:38:53,kbkof3,"Also people forget that game time is totally differnet beast than any training. Ayton said after his 25 match ban he trained all the time, yet his tighs were burning after 10 minutes of play"
10941,2020-12-13 01:31:10,kbkof3,[deleted]
10942,2020-12-13 03:14:43,kbkof3,Terry definitely is pressing. Probably just those first game jitters trying to show out. Incredible play by 2nd/3rd stringers
10943,2020-12-13 03:15:51,kbkof3,"I think he’s just nervous and is the sorta player who has high expectations for himself, he just needs some time to adjust."
10944,2020-12-13 01:15:51,kbkof3,"yeah, it was trash last time I tried it. much better this time"
10945,2020-12-13 01:17:07,kbkof3,"I feel like that happens a lot, Luka left all by himself."
10946,2020-12-13 02:22:31,kbkof3,"Maybe a few minutes, but thats it. Judging from the other games."
10947,2020-12-13 02:24:50,kbkof3,"yes, he's not coming back until sometime in January."
10948,2020-12-13 02:24:52,kbkof3,"Yes, Coach said he will not be playing before the new year."
10949,2020-12-13 02:39:45,kbkof3,"nah, rick isn’t bud lol"
10950,2020-12-13 02:43:11,kbkof3,nah
10951,2020-12-13 02:36:20,kbkof3,Probably. Luka almost definitely is.
10952,2020-12-13 02:58:20,kbkof3,Better
10953,2020-12-13 01:17:10,kbkof3,"Jrich, James Johnson, drafted Josh Green, Tyrell Terry, and Tyler Bey"
10954,2020-12-13 01:17:23,kbkof3,We traded Seth for JRich.
10955,2020-12-13 01:17:29,kbkof3,Jason Richardson
10956,2020-12-13 01:17:30,kbkof3,"Jrich, james johnson and wes iwundu. Also drafted 3 players"
10957,2020-12-13 01:17:40,kbkof3,"Josh Richardson, got him and a draft pick in the Seth trade. Added James Johnson as well"
10958,2020-12-13 01:17:40,kbkof3,Josh Richardson and James Johnson. Pretty great considering we had no money.
10959,2020-12-13 01:18:00,kbkof3,"josh richardson, james johnson , iwundu ( hope im not butchering his name)"
10960,2020-12-13 01:15:27,kbkof3,mavs.com
10961,2020-12-13 02:51:55,kbkof3,"yes had to close that shit, so annoying"
10962,2020-12-13 02:57:02,kbkof3,"If you exit out, refresh. Go back to [mavs.com](https://mavs.com) do it a few times it eventually fixes the problem. I couldn't click on full screen at first either but I zoomed out a bit and it let me click on full screen after that."
10963,2020-12-13 03:05:29,kbkof3,True but since we are up 17 I think Boban is kind of taking the piss while also practicing that shot because he does take that shot often relative to a big guy.
10964,2020-12-13 03:05:07,kbkof3,"He's trying to show he's more than just a sharp shooter and I hate it. At the same time, it's freaking awesome to watch Boban shoot threes lol"
10965,2020-12-13 01:26:41,kbkof3,Why was this downvoted??
10966,2020-12-13 01:32:11,kbkof3,Mavs.com is streaming it
10967,2020-12-13 01:04:20,kbkof3,Has countdown for me. Currently at 40s
10968,2020-12-13 01:03:32,kbkof3,It has a countdown for me.
10969,2020-12-13 01:04:10,kbkof3,I have a game countdown clock at 1 min to go.
10970,2020-12-13 01:18:09,kbkof3,it's black out because u live too close to local broadcasts buddy
10971,2020-12-13 00:52:25,kbkof3,"Nope, this guy is just pushing his website."
10972,2020-12-13 01:30:41,kbkof3,Wtf it's literally the first quarter of a pre season game. ????????????????
10973,2020-12-13 01:31:00,kbkof3,And you know all that from watching him play for 6 minutes in a preseason game? lmao
10974,2020-12-13 01:31:25,kbkof3,Calm the hell down. It's preseason.
10975,2020-12-13 01:32:01,kbkof3,Cmon man relax it’s the first preseason game
10976,2020-12-13 02:01:56,kbkof3,our favorite troll is back!
10977,2020-12-13 03:08:10,kbkof3,Green was playing fine when he was in the game.   Definitely better than Terry.  I think Terry is too hyped tonight and needs to calm down.
10978,2020-12-13 03:07:47,kbkof3,I thought Green looked nice
10979,2020-12-13 03:07:24,kbkof3,"What? Green looked great tonight. 

I think it's more: Green > Hinton > Bey > Terry > Iwundu"
10980,2020-12-13 01:50:48,kbkof3,"calling it now, u/alecweezy is a nephew"
10981,2020-12-13 01:50:18,kbkof3,He looks great for a rookie so far...
10982,2020-12-13 01:51:46,kbkof3,He's played like 8 minutes in the NBA
10983,2020-12-13 01:50:11,kbkof3,Lol what.

10988,2020-12-13 06:19:14,kbkof3,Subscribe
10989,2020-12-13 06:05:35,kbkof3,That's due to the culture Kelvin Sampson has created over the years.  Nate was one relentless SOB though.
10990,2020-12-13 00:23:26,kbkof3,3 months of 2020 is like 8 regular months
10991,2020-12-12 07:23:05,kbkof3,"I guess, I am not sure I can stay awake anyway"
10992,2020-12-13 07:37:43,kbkof3,Footwork and instincts matter my dude
10993,2020-12-13 02:22:58,kbkof3,Very well said.
10994,2020-12-13 01:51:11,kbkof3,Yes he is. Kinda joking though...
10995,2020-12-13 02:51:41,kbkof3,yeah..I hope this starter business is not long term.
10996,2020-12-13 04:26:33,kbkof3,He hasn’t played in almost a year. Give him some time
10997,2020-12-13 03:19:54,kbkof3,And all the way to the very top of the nosebleeds
10998,2020-12-13 00:23:21,kbkof3,stop
10999,2020-12-13 02:13:28,kbkof3,True. I guess I meant average in terms of people at his skill level and shooting ability.
11000,2020-12-13 03:09:44,kbkof3,"They're cutting C.Lee, Gillespie, and Patterson. They're just camp guys."
11001,2020-12-13 01:41:09,kbkof3,So. Hes had moments.. but Green looked....green?
11002,2020-12-13 01:48:35,kbkof3,Oh I was thinking Courtney Lee
11003,2020-12-13 02:55:47,kbkof3,Probably jealous of Luka being able to sit on the bench while Brunson & Co drove up the lead.
11004,2020-12-13 02:45:45,kbkof3,Looks like he puts a little too much on his shot close to the hoop right now but honestly I give a lot of that to first-game jitters. Once he settles in I think he's gonna be just fine. His cuts give me confidence that he's already understanding the flow of our offense.
11005,2020-12-12 10:00:24,kbkof3,"Thank you! And time zones are confusing, don’t blame you one bit for it.

The worst one is when people think GMT=London time ... in the summer. My approach is to use major cities instead of time zone abbreviations when communicating times because of that."
11006,2020-12-12 07:39:30,kbkof3,"Believe it or not, it took me longer to formulate it and type it on my phone than the delta between the timestamp on your comment and the timestamp on mine."
11007,2020-12-12 09:41:55,kbkof3,"I can see that for preseason. And yeah, hopefully KP starts at the 5 when he’s healthy again. Fingers crossed. 

I know there were a ton of other variables, but Maxi was so much better coming off the bench for most of the season than he was starting in the bubble. I want him to go back to that role where he thrived."
11008,2020-12-13 03:23:09,kbkof3,Two ways are not part of the 15 man roster
11009,2020-12-13 03:34:07,kbkof3,Do we have the right to sign him to a regular contract or can someone sign him before us? How does that work?
11010,2020-12-13 03:45:05,kbkof3,I was pretty sure Bey and Terry were two-ways and Hinton was exhibit 10. That was the original plan did they change it?
11011,2020-12-13 07:43:46,kbkof3,"I feel like he isn't disciplined in staying in a defensive stance. He's sometimes caught standing vertical. 

His awareness seemed ok"
11012,2020-12-13 02:44:55,kbkof3,"Sure, finishing plays isnt there yet, I agree, but it is literaly his first game with the team. The basics are all there...but maby shooting, we are yet to see about that."
11013,2020-12-13 03:07:44,kbkof3,Just watch his highlights from Houston. I'm feeling validated rn because I had him ranked 30 on my board lol. Plays with so much fire.
11014,2020-12-13 03:08:14,kbkof3,After watching  highlights this is what I was hoping for.
11015,2020-12-13 03:21:06,kbkof3,"I forgot about the injury, thanks man."
11016,2020-12-13 02:07:36,kbkof3,well Jokic did just that
11017,2020-12-13 02:07:38,kbkof3,I'm not worried. It wouldn't surprise if the first 2 maybe 3 weeks are a wee bit rough but Luka is still gonna be cookin folks.
11018,2020-12-13 02:11:19,kbkof3,be careful pm\_me\_ur\_dwade\_hate will say you are a hawks fan if you say so
11019,2020-12-13 02:12:20,kbkof3,How do you know he hasn't? I wouldn't judge from a preseason game going at 70% speed.
11020,2020-12-13 03:31:49,kbkof3,"I agree Green was great, I guess Hinton was just a bigger surprise. They can be 1a/1b tonight."
11021,2020-12-13 02:36:54,kbkof3,I said that when he had a good little stretch then he started fucking up
11022,2020-12-13 02:36:23,kbkof3,...Which is why this is gonna be a redemption year. Seemed locked in on defense and his shot comes off quicker
11023,2020-12-13 03:06:43,kbkof3,Then we re signed courtney lee though.
11024,2020-12-13 03:18:09,kbkof3,Damn I didn’t know that
11025,2020-12-13 01:16:10,kbkof3,Thanks!
11026,2020-12-13 02:50:17,kbkof3,Thanks man. I know it’s preseason but I’m fucking hyped. That’s great news.
11027,2020-12-13 03:51:10,kbkof3,Yeah I forgot they upgraded Hinton from exhibit 10 to 2 way when they signed terry to the longer deal. So Lee or Iwundu has to go. Almost certainly Lee
11028,2020-12-13 01:26:06,kbkof3,He always wears the undershirt when he’s thicker. That clues us in
11029,2020-12-13 01:25:52,kbkof3,idk where you getting 2 weeks to get ready lol
11030,2020-12-13 03:01:19,kbkof3,"I mean, Delon for the vet min would be fine. It’s the contract that made it an issue."
11031,2020-12-13 00:46:03,kbkof3,“We” I at least wasn’t excited for JJax. Delon sure but rookies as a Mavs fan are more exciting than FA’s (most of the time) because we literally never get and play rookies. Looks like all 3 plus the undrafted might play tonight. Tyrell Terry as a prospect is more interesting than any FA we brought in last year. Imo
11032,2020-12-13 02:33:00,kbkof3,You win
11033,2020-12-13 01:39:57,kbkof3,"Yeah, the only thing we should take out of this is that they actually played another team again lol, I trust him and the whole team to have it figured out by the time we play Phoenix"
11034,2020-12-13 01:31:43,kbkof3,"Exactly, it’s a slow build up to what really matters in a couple weeks"
11035,2020-12-13 03:18:14,kbkof3,"Shooters take time to adjust. If I recall, Young looked awful in his first summer league."
11036,2020-12-13 03:18:49,kbkof3,Yeah I heard early on in his college season he told his coach he couldnt handle it. Hopefully he gets out of his head.
11037,2020-12-13 02:52:52,kbkof3,I just muted the main audio.
11038,2020-12-13 03:09:06,kbkof3,"Yeah lol. I don't want Boban taking 3's ever tbh but during a preseason game meh, shoot your shot Boban."
11039,2020-12-13 01:07:07,kbkof3,Not there for me. Might have to use a dodgy stream instead. Unfortunate cause it's Bucks commentators
11040,2020-12-13 01:29:46,kbkof3,I thought the black out games would only apply if they were playing on ESPN etc? This isn't playing on FSSW
11041,2020-12-13 01:51:21,kbkof3,Calm the hell down. It’s Reddit.
11042,2020-12-13 01:51:28,kbkof3,Cmon man relax. It’s Reddit.
11043,2020-12-13 02:05:44,kbkof3,The fuck you're talking about I just made an opinion on an specific play you clown
11044,2020-12-13 03:09:53,kbkof3,He did. He was playing against the Bucks 1st unit half the time. People are overreacting to these guys playing against other 3rd unit guys.
11045,2020-12-12 07:28:10,kbkof3,My daughter wakes up around 3 am every night anyway so I'm just gonna stay up instead of going back to bed hehe
11046,2020-12-13 03:49:38,kbkof3,"They made it sound like Lee had a shot, but you’re almost certainly right."
11047,2020-12-12 07:41:04,kbkof3,😁...it was just a joke...
11048,2020-12-12 09:44:06,kbkof3,yeah. lets hope Johnson can contribute at a high level so that we can alternate between him and DFS at the 4 with the starters.
11049,2020-12-12 15:19:23,kbkof3,Maxi had to start to guard kawhi and that killed his legs and therefore his shot. Tbh I thought he did an excellent job starting. Filled his role perfectly (tough to ask him to do more than we were). Though I do agree his natural role is off the bench
11050,2020-12-12 16:57:42,kbkof3,"If KP starts at the 5 when he's back, do Powell or Maxi head to the bench?"
11051,2020-12-13 05:44:34,kbkof3,They said that the two ways would be eligible to play 50 games this season as part of changes to deal with COVID. With things like they are they may get some playing time.
11052,2020-12-13 03:42:29,kbkof3,I believe the 2 way contract is for the season so they would need to offer him a contract for next year. A two way contract means he can only spend so much time with the team this year (50 games) the rest in G league. G league players not on a two way can be signed to any team.
11053,2020-12-13 03:46:24,kbkof3,They gave Terry a four year contract
11054,2020-12-13 02:51:45,kbkof3,"Yeah im not hating on him. I like the fact that he’s thinking one step ahead already. He just have to learn to look to score on drives and then the pass will be there. He seems to drive to pass atm. 

He’ll learn how to deal with ball screens as he gets more experience."
11055,2020-12-13 02:13:55,kbkof3,Luka usually comes out on fire first part of the season.
11056,2020-12-13 02:38:11,kbkof3,Lol
11057,2020-12-13 03:10:31,kbkof3,"Lee was sogned as veteran presence in training camp, and for him to get a chance to prove he has recovered for injury so he could possibly land a contract somewhere.

If we were cutting anyone else, there is zero chance JJ would be gone."
11058,2020-12-13 04:12:20,kbkof3,"Yeah they opted out of the G League bubble. So as far as I know, there is no Legends team this season. At least until a vaccine is widely distributed."
11059,2020-12-13 02:51:39,kbkof3,"We're deep, baby. Luka is a bit out of shape though 😳"
11060,2020-12-13 03:04:58,kbkof3,Nah im good
11061,2020-12-13 00:50:31,kbkof3,"That's true, I want to see if Terry or Green can get actual minutes this season. I think Bey will be more of a project."
11062,2020-12-13 01:34:00,kbkof3,"Black out only applies when it's not on TNT/ESPN/ ""nationally televised"" Fox sports Southwest is a regional channel"
11063,2020-12-13 03:12:59,kbkof3,"Bro they have Wilson, Craig, and Portia in what do you mean 3rd unit. But yeah Green was out there with all the dogs."
11064,2020-12-12 09:44:57,kbkof3,I think Dorian has that spot pretty locked down.
11065,2020-12-12 15:21:02,kbkof3,"He also had an injured hand since early in the bubble, compounding the problem."
11066,2020-12-12 17:30:28,kbkof3,"Ideally both, imo. 

Start Luka, Hardaway Jr, Richardson, Doe Doe, and KP."
11067,2020-12-13 03:49:09,kbkof3,"That’s right, I forgot they gave him the Brunson special. Well I guess we’ll get a good look at Hinton all year since they can be up the whole time."
11068,2020-12-13 02:53:34,kbkof3,A little rust is forgivable. A couple more games and he’s good to go. Reading comments right and it looks line we had a great preseason opener. Hope it carries through the regular season.
11069,2020-12-13 00:57:39,kbkof3,Yeah same! I think they Green will get more minutes just due to his defensive ability but I hope Bey can be a decent role player one day. He’s athletic and is good defensively. If he can just be a plus defensive player and at least a more reliable shooter than MKG he’ll have a role here.
11070,2020-12-13 01:40:51,kbkof3,Damn so since I live in Frisco league pass won't help me? I guess my thought was I would be able to watch FSSW with league pass.
11071,2020-12-12 09:56:16,kbkof3,I hope not. He is great but he is too often undersized against opposing 4s. With Rich we already bolstered our defense so I rather have us match size than insist on DFS starting in all cases. And THJ is a lock for me.
11072,2020-12-12 15:22:58,kbkof3,Totally forgot about this! Good point
11073,2020-12-13 03:51:39,kbkof3,They only increased it from 45 to 50 games sadly
11074,2020-12-13 01:44:52,kbkof3,"unfortunately not since league pass has blackout restrictions, but the league pass broadcast is the same as fssw, do you have a TV provider? If u have cable u can watch fssw on that just fine, or u can log in to fox sports with ur provider on their website and watch it on a browser as well."
11075,2020-12-12 19:29:12,kbkof3,DSF will play a lot more on SF position as he did last year because of the lack of tall players.
11076,2020-12-13 03:52:39,kbkof3,I thought everyone took it as a given that they’d be able to be up the whole year. What the hell NBA? Then rosters better be 15 for sure. Something has to give this year.
11077,2020-12-13 01:53:45,kbkof3,Unfortunately not. Only provider I am aware of is AT&T that carries FSSW at the moment b
11078,2020-12-13 03:58:52,kbkof3,"You can dress 15, who knows what happens if covid issues occur"
11079,2020-12-13 04:13:14,kbkof3,They can be with the team all year but can only dress 50 games. But if he earns minutes and impresses they can always sign him to a regular contract. Just have to free up a spot on the 15 man.
11080,2020-12-13 02:00:15,kbkof3,I think any of them should? I have fssw on frontier
11081,2020-12-13 04:14:12,kbkof3,"Right but then you’re back to who do you cut? The only options would be Boban, Johnson, Iwundu right?"
11082,2020-12-13 04:15:34,kbkof3,"Could also have a mid-season trade, like a 2 for 1 player trade that frees up a spot."

Fucking. Bijan. Robinson."

Not expecting that big a jump but I think the defense will be the best in the conference at least next season."

Instead of it feeling like we just played well and had a good game plan, we looked like we did for most of the season at the start (except for Bijan’s runs), and only started dominating once Casey went in. I haven’t learned a damn thing and I’m going in hard on the koolaid. 2021 big 12 champs or bust"

If we played A&Ms schedule I think we would have gone 7-2 at least, and we clearly were not a great team this season."

11250,2020-12-30 21:22:35,kmwefg,I think AT&T is the only stream that carries them.
11251,2020-12-30 23:33:56,kmwefg,Fuck Sinclair man.
11252,2020-12-31 01:29:22,kmwefg,So far it’s not been fun
11253,2020-12-31 05:57:59,kmwefg,I agree. I also think if we played Florida's schedule we would've had the same record as them (and played in the SEC CCG). It's a complete hypothetical of course but I just think the wins and losses would've ended up about the same.
11254,2020-12-30 16:48:25,kmwefg,"I'm not a Herman fan, but I want him to stay coach if we can't land Urban. I don't want us to fire him to take a chance on guys like Sark or James Franklin."
11255,2020-12-30 16:26:36,kmwefg,"People are upset about being above average instead of great, but I think those same people forget how bad we were under Strong.

I would rather 8-10 wins regularly with close games and an occasional ccg/playoff berth than 5-7 with absolute beat downs every year."
11256,2020-12-30 19:29:09,kmwefg,"Yeah I was firmly in the fire Tom camp after ISU but seeing what’s out there I’m backing off that. I don’t trust Sark as HC. Saleh from  the 49ers is intriguing but I’m not convinced that NFL success is indicative of a great college coach. I dont like Brian Kelly and I think he is overrated.  I don’t know who else is out there that we can get but nobody checks all my boxes. If I had to pick a guy it would be Fickle but the G5 superstar has burnt us recently.  However I need to see waaay better game time decisions out of Tom from now on or this is it for me. No more Mensa bullshit. Pound the rock, control the clock, and let our talent shine."
11257,2020-12-30 16:49:27,kmwefg,"I was never really looped into whatever coaching hires were attempted, but I’m ready to move ahead with Herman as head coach going into next year unless there’s some real proof that they are still considering axing him. Herman and the team underperformed this year no question about it and no excuses. But like you said let’s see what Herman does with a new qb and his coordinators with a year behind them. And an actual spring camp. I know I said no excuses but I’m trying to look at having two new coordinators with no spring camp and not having the normal slate of tune-up games to be some upside going into next year for Herman and his crew. We’ll see. He’ll be running on a 6” leash."
11258,2020-12-30 21:00:37,kmwefg,It was Herman’s decision to not play Thompson for YEARS so that speaks a lot for Herman’s shit coaching
11259,2020-12-30 21:45:19,kmwefg,Young?
11260,2020-12-30 21:44:55,kmwefg,eyyy I ordered the three pack after that thread lol. The bean sauce looks interesting and I love jerk so figured WHY NOT and smashed that order button

Vaccine messaging has been dogshit."
11262,2020-12-31 03:05:39,kmwefg,I think is a good compromise while staying away from other people as much as possible.  Gotta take care of mentals too.
11263,2020-12-31 03:23:17,kmwefg,Make sure to wait a couple of weeks after they get it if you want to be extra careful. I read that it’s not completely effective until a couple of weeks after the first dose.
11264,2020-12-31 05:31:34,kmwefg,It humanized them a bit too much for my taste. For a second I almost viewed them as college students who were just excited about a fun experience instead of the demon spawn I'm sworn to root against.
11265,2020-12-31 01:44:16,kmwefg,"The first response tweet that showed up for me was the 9/11 and Pearl Harbor death count vs. yesterday's covid lol

Also must be nice to flaunt shit like that when one in seven Texans were suffering through food insecurity BEFORE covid (2019).

Not gonna lie, the man has done some serious work in the win column and recruiting Texas.  The playoff loses hurt, but i'd rather be there than the ole ""we are three plays from the big 12 championship!"""

11269,2020-12-31 04:52:58,kmwefg,The Red River Shootout is always a coin-flip and next year's game will probably be decided by one score either way.
11270,2020-12-31 04:45:38,kmwefg,"Don’t worry. Nobody will seriously think we have any chance, so we’ve got a great shot to win."
11271,2020-12-30 15:41:23,kmwefg,Yeah except they've won 6 straight big 12 championships and they've lost because they were in the college football playoff. It infuriates me.

11275,2020-12-30 22:08:27,kmwefg,I’m sure they do. They have “turn over worthy plays” which includes throws that should have been intercepted.

11287,2020-12-30 19:59:21,kmwefg,Thanks! It really flew by. It was always my dream to go to UT and it came and went. On to the next chapter!
11288,2020-12-30 15:46:21,kmwefg,"Him and Hutzler are maybe the best assistant hires we’ve ever had, at least in my memory"

11310,2020-12-30 16:27:27,kmwefg,It had a good run. Now I can go full Odin. If only I got the wisdom in the tradeoff.
11311,2020-12-30 08:34:35,kmwefg,"Im guessing theres a handshake under the table with RoJo to give him reps. Its why he didnt bounce and didnt fuck our RB room because at the end of the day we have 2 healthy RBs + watson, Rojo leaves we go down to 2 with any injury including Ingram which happened. 

But i have no idea whats going on. we have the best RB in the nation just chillin"
11312,2020-12-30 15:23:17,kmwefg,"He’s only had 3 season to make that big “if” a little smaller, and has failed to do so."

11315,2020-12-31 01:39:15,kmwefg,fuck
11316,2020-12-30 18:58:26,kmwefg,"Agreed, at least for this year. Don’t fire a guy who we know has at least a high enough floor to have a winning record to replace him with someone who hasn’t been a consistent winner. If Herman pulls together some magic and gets LJ Johnson and other surprises, and does better next year when his staff has a full offseason, things could be different. If they’re not, then throw some money out."
11317,2020-12-30 16:51:54,kmwefg,Saying Herman can get an occasional playoff birth is a huge stretch.
11318,2020-12-30 20:22:04,kmwefg,"I feel like this is a false dichotomy. Strong wasn't just bad, he was terrible. 3 consecutive losing seasons at Texas is an anomoly. Just because Herman's outdoing that doesn't mean we should be content with the past several years. Texas can and should aim better; this ain't Baylor or Tech.

I also feel that the odds of Herman backing into the playoffs are pretty low as long as Riley is in Norman."
11319,2020-12-30 23:28:56,kmwefg,McCoy and Ash were pretty easy too
11320,2020-12-30 22:17:45,kmwefg,That jerk was calling to me but I just went with the hot sauce for now. I prob should’ve gone with the variety pack tbh

11323,2020-12-31 01:46:23,kmwefg,"Yeah, he doesn't give a shit about the peasants."
11324,2020-12-31 01:45:19,kmwefg,Rightly so.
11325,2020-12-30 15:48:42,kmwefg,Minor details
11326,2020-12-30 17:34:13,kmwefg,Don't know how I forgot him.
11327,2020-12-30 17:12:36,kmwefg,We’re gonna switch Overshown all the way from a safety to a d-lineman in 2 seasons?
11328,2020-12-30 19:01:21,kmwefg,Yeah he turned that group around. We thought they'd be our biggest weakness on D
11329,2020-12-30 17:43:29,kmwefg,Yeah. To be honest that whole from 7 on D looked great together.
11330,2020-12-30 16:06:06,kmwefg,"Well, unlike our last few 1st year great DCs, Ash has a resume of being a top tier DC"
11331,2020-12-30 16:04:55,kmwefg,True but I feel like Orlando lacked the development we are seeing under Ash.
11332,2020-12-30 16:33:27,kmwefg,But I'm also not *not* saying that we could.
11333,2020-12-30 19:11:42,kmwefg,Hey we play down to our competition (as both a longhorn and a steeler fan). I’d be shocked if that game didn’t come down to a last second field goal.
11334,2020-12-31 01:41:00,kmwefg,gracias
11335,2020-12-30 21:20:21,kmwefg,Fair.
11336,2020-12-30 21:20:33,kmwefg,Absolutely.
11337,2020-12-30 15:54:18,kmwefg,"Yeah, I'm just curious as to why he had to step back last night when many have speculated that he has been playing hurt all season. 

I think Sam should move on, but I want to know if this is just wear and tear or something more serious that could affect his career."
11338,2020-12-30 16:13:24,kmwefg,The love 💕between Sam and Herman is strong so never say never
11339,2020-12-30 08:20:59,kmwefg,whooooo?
11340,2020-12-30 15:36:48,kmwefg,"I figured it was likely stress or caffeine. I've been taking in more caffeine, but stress hasn't been an issue, so hydration it is!"
11341,2020-12-30 15:26:44,kmwefg,That's what makes me so skeptical of keeping Herman on. He hasn't shown a lot of coaching flexibility (other than playing down/up to an opponent) or lessons learned. It seems as if change (personnel or tactics) have to be forced upon him.
11342,2020-12-30 13:57:50,kmwefg,"What did the dad carp say to his son as he left for school?

Bison."
11343,2020-12-30 19:03:10,kmwefg,Occasional Big 12 championship berth more like it
11344,2020-12-30 17:01:06,kmwefg,"Fair. I just meant I think it's likely that he will occasionally fall into a great season and (unless something changes) will regularly be above average but not great. 

We were so bad before he got here though. Strong was 16-21 overall, 12-15 in conference, and 0-1 in bowls. We fired him because we wanted to stop being terrible at football. Herman is 32-18 overall, 22-13 in conference, and 4-0 in bowls. Thats not great, but if we fire him, it'll be because we want to be great instead of good. Which is a fair thing to want (I certainly want to be in the CCG every year) but it's a riskier decision."
11345,2020-12-31 03:48:04,kmwefg,Sounds like you’ll be good to go then. Can’t wait for my grandparents to get the vaccine.
11346,2020-12-30 15:50:13,kmwefg,Sorry I just see that Kyle Umlang guy post that shit and it pisses me off lol

11348,2020-12-30 19:12:25,kmwefg,Getting DMO to buy in on the position change is honestly borderline miraculous.

11351,2020-12-30 20:06:34,kmwefg,"Ostensibly, the team doctors pulled Sam. I don’t know what he did during the game that made it so that he could start pre-game and practice, but not play 2 more quarters."

11361,2020-12-30 20:02:21,kmwefg,"I’ve always thought the 2 most difficult positions to coach would be o-line and DBs, and since he didn’t even have an off-season, I’m willing to give him a pass on the secondary having some struggles this season."

11363,2020-12-30 14:31:23,kmwbsy,"That's was great, really fun read! Thank you!"
11364,2020-12-30 06:30:06,kmwbsy,THAT'S A HUGE HIT RIGHT THERE
11365,2021-01-02 00:04:34,kmwbsy,Amazing
11366,2020-12-30 05:02:26,kmt6pm,Lots of smoke about quite a number of players who might declare early. I'd be shocked if there weren't at least a few juniors on this list before it's all said and done. That's been the case every year since the Davidson rule was instituted.
11367,2020-12-30 10:13:33,kmt6pm,"While Macario played forward as a freshman and Sophomore, she was moved to the midfield her junior year at Stanford where she had around as many goals and assists as both her  previous years combined.  I think Vlatko feels she will be as effective with the NT as a midfielder as well, since she was listed as a midfielder for the two camps she attended. One thing for sure, she is the type of versatile player that will give a team a lot of flexibility in just how best she can be used."
11368,2020-12-30 05:33:03,kmt6pm,"I wonder if Spirit take Fox. They just got O’Hara and Sonnett. Already have Huester and McGrady. Could convert her to a MF maybe? But I’d think they want help offensively and take McKeown. Unless Howell declares...

I think Ekic is still around for the 11th pick for Louisville. And I’ll be surprised if no one grabs Otto.

Laurel Ivory should be added for GKs out of UVA."
11369,2020-12-30 04:02:26,kmt6pm,"Keeping Ekic in the Louisville metro, I see. Could provide some stability for a rookie."
11370,2020-12-30 09:22:32,kmt6pm,"Schlegel is a redshirt sophomore, the other senior up front is Frankie Tagliaferri. Very curious to see where Coffey and Abello lands though as a Penn State guy/having watched them play (and if they'll opt to join their respective teams after the Big Ten season).

Abello could also be a curious case with her decision bc she's like super smart and def going to med school they call her Dr. Abello lol"
11371,2020-12-30 18:28:29,kmt6pm,"I just wanted to share my immense appreciation for taking the time to put this together. I've been starving for coverage of NWSL prospects and so few major sports sites cover them. That being said, I'm looking forward to this year's draft and can't wait to see who the Thorns pick up!"
11372,2020-12-30 15:29:08,kmt6pm,"One of the best talents I don’t see talked about too much is Taylor Morgan from Alabama. She’s not going to be a starter, at least not for a while, but she can absolutely be somebody’s super sub and I hope she gets a shot."
11373,2020-12-30 19:57:45,kmt6pm,Is Macario even going to come out?
11374,2020-12-30 08:11:36,kmt6pm,A Spirit fan here that seems to have some connection to the org has alluded to Howell declaring early and subsequently being taken 2nd overall by the Spirit. I think that'd be a much better pick for them.
11375,2020-12-30 10:47:28,kmt6pm,Spirit definitely need attackers more than they need defenders.
11376,2020-12-30 20:10:10,kmt6pm,It’s probable. Especially now that she is finally USWNT eligible and the Olympics are coming up. There’s a good chance her clearance is done by FIFA before then and she’s able to be rostered.
11377,2020-12-30 21:50:41,kmt6pm,"I agree she will most likely come out just so she can compete against the better competition she will get in the NWSL. Far better then what she will get in college. Better for getting ready for the Olympic competition. Also, she is on track to graduate before the NWSL season starts."

11379,2020-12-29 22:24:05,kmog6u,I love how carr dragged a 30 ppg defense to become only then 2nd team in history with 7 wins after giving up 30 ppg and people think he might be replaced
11380,2020-12-29 22:42:28,kmog6u,"Take this to the fucking bank: there's no fucking way the Jets don't draft either Wilson, Fields or Lance come April.

All that noise you're hearing from NY is speculation from wishful fans and clickbait media types. 

No fucking way our GM and any new coach stake their reputations and futures on attempting to repair Darnold in his 4th year with his contract situation needing to be resolved in a year. Most likely they will bring in their own guy and reset the QB contract clock."

11382,2020-12-29 22:31:25,kmog6u,"I'd be pissed if Dak went to the Pats, but that would be just our luck"
11383,2020-12-29 22:24:15,kmog6u,Delete this
11384,2020-12-29 22:25:44,kmog6u,Don’t let the patriots have Dak
11385,2020-12-29 22:36:09,kmog6u,Wait the pats have cap for dak? If they want a full roster I don't see that being possible
11386,2020-12-29 22:24:08,kmog6u,If the Saints are dumb enough to start a glorified gadget player for a full season then they'll be lucky to have their typical annual 7-9 season
11387,2020-12-29 22:37:15,kmog6u,If we get Dak I’ll instantly buy 3 throwbacks to help support the contract
11388,2020-12-29 22:25:12,kmog6u,"I doubt the Steelers draft a QB this upcoming draft. I’m a fan of guys like Trask and Jones but it just doesn’t really make sense. We’re not going to be very competitive next season. Too many guys leaving, and the team essentially needs a mini-rebuild. Ben will retire at the end of next season and then the team will draft his replacement."
11389,2020-12-29 22:41:22,kmog6u,Is Trask really a day 2 pick? I'm surprised that a Heisman finalist would fall that far
11390,2020-12-29 22:55:34,kmog6u,"The Lions better not draft Justin Fields. If we move on from Stafford, I'd like to see us sign either Andy Dalton or Ryan Fitzpatrick, and then have any qb not named fields sitting behind them."
11391,2020-12-29 23:59:46,kmog6u,Personally I'd love to see Mariota go to the Patriots
11392,2020-12-29 22:31:27,kmog6u,Don’t the Falcons eat a lot of cap if they get rid of Ryan? I think it’s more likely he stays and they hope new coaches help them win these close games they are losing.
11393,2020-12-29 22:26:47,kmog6u,"More likely Pats take Sam Darnold, Dak to Denver, Stafford to 49ers, and Matt Ryan to NOLA."
11394,2020-12-29 22:36:33,kmog6u,"Packers - Rodgers

Vikings - Cousins

Bears - Mitch/Foles

Lions - Winston/Lance

Saints - Jones/Hill

Buccaneers - Brady/Trask

Panthers - Teddy

WFT - Minshew/Smith/Allen

Eagles - Hurts/Wentz

Cowboys - Prescott

Giants - Jones

The first 3 for the NFC West is obvious but the Rams likely search for a viable backup

49ers - Zach Wilson 

Steelers - Stafford
 
Next 2 is obvious and I agree with the Bengals take

First 3 is obvious for AFC South

Colts - Rivers

Bills - Allen

Dolphins - Tua

Patriots - Fitzpatrick/Stidham

Jets - Fields

First 3 for AFC West is obvious

Broncos - Lock/Mariota"
11395,2020-12-29 22:28:46,kmog6u,"I've had my criticisms of Carr in the past, and I still think he can only take you so far, but he's been excellent this year and he's shown he can run a top offense. He's not exactly that old either, no reason to move on from him."
11396,2020-12-29 22:49:28,kmog6u,"Barring a Carson Wentz like meltdown, I don't see the Raiders moving on from Carr, he's been excellent."
11397,2020-12-29 22:27:43,kmog6u,Completely agree. Hes been better than most people think
11398,2020-12-29 22:59:36,kmog6u,This sounds very angry but I hope you speak it into existence
11399,2020-12-29 23:16:58,kmog6u,"This is exactly it.  No matter what Darnold does or doesn't do or the potential he has or doesn't have, the politics and economics of the game mean that a new Jets regime can't carry on with him."
11400,2020-12-29 22:51:54,kmog6u,I think that's what they SHOULD do (I've never been a believer in Darnold) but I could see the new regime trying to plug the other holes in this roster since they won't get the obvious QB1 in the draft
11401,2020-12-29 22:27:15,kmog6u,Want Garrett Gilbert instead?
11402,2020-12-29 22:47:05,kmog6u,No wait don't
11403,2020-12-29 22:28:25,kmog6u,Thank you for your thoughtful constructive criticism. Have a great day!
11404,2020-12-29 22:48:12,kmog6u,Trask would be what Dak was. Dan Mullen QB drafted by Dallas to be the backup.
11405,2020-12-29 22:43:32,kmog6u,Dak gonna get the brinks truck from Dallas. The NFC East winner will not have 6/7 wins again so if they start Dalton again in 2021 then they'd be stupid
11406,2020-12-29 22:35:10,kmog6u,Watch him get covid and fall off a cliff.
11407,2020-12-29 22:39:01,kmog6u,I believe they have the most projected cap space in the league. They could get Dak and still fill out the rest of thier roster
11408,2020-12-29 22:27:04,kmog6u,">typical annual 7-9 season

What"
11409,2020-12-29 22:26:34,kmog6u,"I agree its not ideal, but Sean Payton loves him, and they don't have the cap space or draft equity to get a better option"
11410,2020-12-29 22:30:48,kmog6u,"What are you talking about, making  ~~white Joe Webb~~ Taysom Hill the full-time starter is a GREAT option for the Saints."
11411,2020-12-29 23:00:03,kmog6u,I gotta believe Sean Peyton isn’t that stupid... Hill looked pretty bad in those starts. I doubt their DST could keep them in games a full season like that. They were getting gassed! The Tim Tebow project failed!
11412,2020-12-29 23:22:35,kmog6u,Dak will get tagged again so we once again have until late July to work out a contract if one is not done.
11413,2020-12-29 22:30:08,kmog6u,Inb4 11-5 Steelers next year
11414,2020-12-29 22:46:05,kmog6u,"Right now it seems like Lawrence, Fields, Lance, and Wilson are all ahead of him. Its just tough to have 5 first round QBs"
11415,2020-12-29 22:32:52,kmog6u,"They would, but that money might be better spent on thier massive holes on the defensive side of the ball"
11416,2020-12-29 22:27:40,kmog6u,Matt Ryan to the Saints would put them right back in SB contention tbh.
11417,2020-12-29 22:30:44,kmog6u,Doubt the Falcons send Matty to a Division rival
11418,2020-12-29 22:35:48,kmog6u,If they had an avg defense theyre a 12 win team that matches up well with the best team in the league. But they aint makin the playoffs. People need to understand you dont need a hall of fame qb if you can put up damn near 30 a game
11419,2020-12-29 22:58:45,kmog6u,"You said it yourself...

> new regime

Darnold is as good as gone. Another stain on the career as a GM for Mike Maccagnan."
11420,2020-12-29 22:28:50,kmog6u,fight on sight.
11421,2020-12-29 22:55:41,kmog6u,Maybe Jerry takes care of Dalton as a long term backup but is there anyone that thinks they can win a superbowl with Andy as the starting QB?
11422,2020-12-29 22:56:29,kmog6u,"Third most, but it’s up there"
11423,2020-12-29 22:37:33,kmog6u,"Payton did have a rough patch there a few years back, but it's been a couple seasons since you could reasonably say that."
11424,2020-12-29 22:31:32,kmog6u,I’m being realistic when I’m saying it’s not happening. I’m predicting an 8-8 or 9-7 season at best.
11425,2020-12-29 22:50:32,kmog6u,Steelers are more likely going 6-10 than 11-5. Not with that trash tier offense
11426,2020-12-29 22:40:36,kmog6u,"I think his point is they won’t have the money at all, it’ll be something like $30 million dead cap hit"
11427,2020-12-29 22:28:44,kmog6u,"Yup, he has 5 years of life left.

NOLA is such a stacked team even Teddy poo poo looked good starting there."
11428,2020-12-29 22:30:04,kmog6u,"The Saints don't have the cap space to take Ryan's contract, and the Falcons wouldn't trade him to thier rival. I don't see that at all"
11429,2020-12-29 22:35:43,kmog6u,"Yeah, true. ATL is in CAP hell next year if it goes down to $175M, but so is Nola. $52M in just Brees and Hill if they dump them."
11430,2020-12-29 23:02:48,kmog6u,"Tell that to my idiotic community... smh

Our iGens want to draft Trask!!"
11431,2020-12-29 23:11:55,kmog6u,"Well they're putting up about 26.8 points per game, which is efficient if nothing else, but he needs a really good team around him to contend for a super bowl."
11432,2020-12-29 23:08:07,kmog6u,"Not many non hall of fame QB's can put up 30 points a game year in and year out though, they are HOF's because they are consistently very good over many seasons."
11433,2020-12-29 23:03:59,kmog6u,"Just to play devils advocate, that roster needs A LOT and pretty much any rookie QB would struggle there. Why not trade down from 2, accumulate assets for so the next rookie QB has at least decent weapons, all while giving Darnold a chance to raise his trade value under a coach that's not named Adam Gase?"
11434,2020-12-29 22:56:04,kmog6u,Side Arm Slinger?
11435,2020-12-29 23:25:32,kmog6u,"> but is there anyone that thinks they can win a superbowl with Andy as the starting QB?

there is not"
11436,2020-12-29 22:32:20,kmog6u,How much cap do you have? Only guy I know you're 99% sure not returning is Bud Dupree but what about the rest?
11437,2020-12-29 22:51:20,kmog6u,"They went 8-8 with the Reindeer and Duck as their QBs, I will believe it when I see it"
11438,2020-12-29 23:22:40,kmog6u,"I see, my mistake. As it linked below, they only take on an extra $3 million in cap burden to trade him. They won't be good next year anyway, so it may be worth it to save cap space in the long term and gain good draft capital in the short term

11439,2020-12-29 22:29:54,kmog6u,But would the Falcons trade him to a division rival?
11440,2020-12-29 22:37:11,kmog6u,"Bud Dupree is most likely gone, I can see Haden being gone, Conner is definitely gone, Juju might not be resigned, and we’re losing some of our older linemen as well. We’re pretty short on cap, idk the exact number."
11441,2020-12-29 22:33:10,kmog6u,"Teams do silly things all the time, but that part would be difficult. Maybe my projections are slightly “hope” based... lol"

11445,2020-12-29 22:11:19,kmo7u2,oh god has the hot 100 list ever been this dominated by christmas songs before
11446,2020-12-29 22:20:24,kmo7u2,"rip blinding lights it was a good run, really thought it would last until 2021 though.        
wonder if any songs off WLR will chart next week (my guess is not, mayyybe the song with cudi).    
also feel like that meg/dababy song is gonna be a slow climber but eventually reach top 30"
11447,2020-12-29 23:45:27,kmo7u2,I kinda like how the xmss songs takeover the charts. It cleans the sheet for the new year.
11448,2020-12-29 22:17:36,kmo7u2,"It'll be interesting to see how the charts recover next week when all the Christmas songs drop off. I'm not sure how much of WLR will chart, the top song has only got 3 mil plays on Spotify as of today."
11449,2020-12-30 00:36:18,kmo7u2,"First Christmas without a girlfriend in 4 years . Both our families aren’t Christian so we don’t celebrate it with them but when we were together we would celebrate like in a secular American relationshipy way. Anyways what I’m saying, WLR is the Christmas album I needed this year"
11450,2020-12-30 04:53:52,kmo7u2,"Almost 40 songs on the top 100 are Christmas. They have to do something about ""seasonal"" music. Its holding back alot of artists from the achievement of charting. Artists are going to quit dropping music in December so they don't have to compete with Christmas music"
11451,2020-12-30 02:22:54,kmo7u2,they should really do something about the christmas songs on the charts in this new streaming era. when Mariah Carey went number 1 last year on a 25 year old song it was kinda cute but having the whole top 10 being dominated by christmas songs is tiring
11452,2020-12-30 00:26:22,kmo7u2,I don’t think this is the week of January 02 right?
11453,2020-12-30 05:26:09,kmo7u2,The fact that Christmas in Hollis can't get on this list during Christmas time infuriates me. Let's get some good Christmas music on this list
11454,2020-12-30 00:19:50,kmo7u2,Last year was the start
11455,2020-12-30 02:04:20,kmo7u2,People’s obsession with Christmas music is something I’ll never understand. Is it a religious/Christian thing?
11456,2020-12-29 23:29:44,kmo7u2,"If WLR sells ~125k I feel like a couple of songs will chart, especially since less people are gonna listen to Christmas songs after Dec 25th"
11457,2020-12-30 00:45:57,kmo7u2,"the kanye track would have been a top 5 debut on spotify without christmas songs, i think itll make it"
11458,2020-12-30 00:54:41,kmo7u2,Blinding Lights might come back next week
11459,2020-12-30 01:27:55,kmo7u2,"That's one way to look at it, I fucking hate it."
11460,2020-12-29 23:52:30,kmo7u2,"For the marketing that album got, the first week sale is gonna flop"
11461,2020-12-30 01:18:43,kmo7u2,"Yeah I'm not entirely sure it can beat out taylor swifts album for number 1 anymore tbh, which is sad because if kid cudi was on it that would have been a top 10 hit easily with the album going number 1 even though it was originally big 1.5 years ago, a fan post of the song on youtube uploaded recently as they all get taken down is getting more views than some songs on wlr"
11462,2020-12-30 06:06:56,kmo7u2,2016-2018 i had a gf every christmas! then 2019 and now 2020 i’ve been single. as much as i like a relationship i’ve appreciated my time single. hope you can too man
11463,2020-12-30 05:20:21,kmo7u2,I mean what can they do. AIWFC had 17 million streams in one day on Spotify a couple of days ago. If that’s not deserving of number 1 I don’t know what is.
11464,2020-12-30 13:46:01,kmo7u2,it is. charts are counted week ahead
11465,2020-12-30 02:18:19,kmo7u2,Not necessarily. People just associate it with the holidays. A lot of people are definitely just letting Spotify playlists run the music
11466,2020-12-30 03:07:01,kmo7u2,"Nah man, for me it's just a warm cozy vibe to have Christmas music playing when it's cold outside and I'm at work. Perfect background music for this time of year."
11467,2020-12-30 17:55:23,kmo7u2,"It’s not really a religious thing, christmas is very secularized in America."
11468,2020-12-30 17:12:58,kmo7u2,Christmastime gives many people a feeling that I would say is comparable to nostalgia. Listening to the music helps people get into that feeling. Plus tradition
11469,2020-12-30 07:54:27,kmo7u2,I think Slayer doing better than the kanye song
11470,2020-12-30 06:05:35,kmo7u2,what marketing? it’s literally almost driven by hype generated by carti fans and blogs. no real singles prior to it. it’s just carti posting shit
11471,2020-12-30 00:22:46,kmo7u2,Well I mean the album was terrible
11472,2020-12-30 06:11:10,kmo7u2,Yeah I’m equal parts nervous and excited about my single life. It’s just the uncertainty that gets to me sometimes although I’m sure I’ll be fine. Thanks bro
11473,2020-12-30 02:30:12,kmo7u2,Ah ok makes sense
11474,2020-12-30 16:24:34,kmo7u2,also don't underestimate how many people are using this for their businesses
11475,2020-12-30 20:14:42,kmo7u2,"True shit, can't remember the last time I heard someone regard Christmas celebrations in a religious light"

11479,2020-12-31 01:06:28,kmo7u2,like there's basically another holiday on top of it with Santa and presents that even non-Christians practice and tell their kids abt
11480,2020-12-30 04:48:13,kmo7u2,The beginning sucks and nobody is going to listen to the rest of the album if they get a bad first impression.

11483,2020-12-30 10:08:57,kmo7u2,Best part of the album is beginning and Album is great
11484,2020-12-30 05:03:59,kmo7u2,idk how you can listen to the second half and think most of those songs arent good (assuming youre a carti fan)
11485,2020-12-30 04:57:26,kmo7u2,"As an overall tape yes.

But there's still a few songs that are prime Carti"
11486,2020-12-30 12:04:44,kmo7u2,The one where he’s like THEY THOUGHT I WAS GAY was hard
11487,2020-12-29 21:30:33,kmlmfm,Grey was a good kit choice. Sow emerging out the mist like a battleship.
11488,2020-12-29 21:36:57,kmlmfm,this is how George Boyd sees every football match

11492,2020-12-29 20:50:48,kmlmfm,It’s a matter of weeks before teams stop fielding a goalkeeper against us
11493,2020-12-29 21:46:59,kmlmfm,These grey camo kits really coming in handy.
11494,2020-12-29 21:50:35,kmlmfm,We couldn't finish our fucking dinner at the minute. Woeful.
11495,2020-12-29 20:39:45,kmlmfm,I’m reporting sky to ofcom if they show that fucking goal again
11496,2020-12-29 20:54:26,kmlmfm,"Why are we still here, just to suffer?"
11497,2020-12-29 20:55:37,kmlmfm,"Can we please just ring William Macintosh Davies and tell him to sort it out. 

If we're going down I'd at least like to see an entertainingly fucking mental Billy D on the touch line."
11498,2020-12-29 21:34:57,kmlmfm,Since the fog started this is the most I've enjoyed watching forest all season
11499,2020-12-29 21:49:45,kmlmfm,Knockers is SO left footed
11500,2020-12-29 21:53:11,kmlmfm,Where have this team been all season. We look hungry
11501,2020-12-29 21:25:01,kmlmfm,The opposition are now our leading scorer!
11502,2020-12-29 21:37:57,kmlmfm,They’ve banged out the end-to-end cam on fifa
11503,2020-12-29 21:47:07,kmlmfm,It’s just not our year is it
11504,2020-12-29 20:01:18,kmlmfm,None of our starting XI have scored more than one goal all season.
11505,2020-12-29 20:33:30,kmlmfm,Figs own goal attempt ruled offside
11506,2020-12-29 20:48:25,kmlmfm,we're about 5 feet tall on average stop playing long balls you wank stains
11507,2020-12-29 20:49:05,kmlmfm,just making sure everyone is aware that grabban is captain
11508,2020-12-29 20:52:44,kmlmfm,Just ripped my dick off and threw it at the cat in anger at that
11509,2020-12-29 20:57:21,kmlmfm,I like how fuck all happened in that game so we just had 5 minutes of rewatching that bloody awful goal.
11510,2020-12-29 21:32:24,kmlmfm,"Sow and Yates, ref can’t see you. Do as you will."
11511,2020-12-29 21:32:55,kmlmfm,"i'm gonna make up my own game, with blackjack and hookers"
11512,2020-12-29 21:36:10,kmlmfm,This is fucked up lol
11513,2020-12-29 21:36:30,kmlmfm,Level playing field now - this vision has been our players brains all season long
11514,2020-12-29 21:40:37,kmlmfm,"It’s actually embarrassing how funny these commentators find themselves 

Like a senior teacher no one likes"
11515,2020-12-29 21:48:28,kmlmfm,Lmfao Cafu it was genuinely harder to miss. Pretty impressive.
11516,2020-12-29 21:57:41,kmlmfm,"knockaert lolley and ameobi are all so selfish, both midfield players sit so deep and cannot play forward passes, playing in this team must be as bad as it is to watch"

11518,2020-12-29 20:47:32,kmlmfm,The way Sow crashes into people to make a point then walks off like his coffee is ready still gives me boners
11519,2020-12-29 20:49:18,kmlmfm,Grabban trying to buy a penalty like he’s in the Poundland sales
11520,2020-12-29 20:50:21,kmlmfm,"well that was depressing  


gonna go outside and watch snow turn into sludge"
11521,2020-12-29 21:08:16,kmlmfm,If we all do a snow and fog dance there's a chance we can get this game called off.
11522,2020-12-29 21:16:05,kmlmfm,We just look like 11 men on a pitch. No willingness to help a team mate out
11523,2020-12-29 21:24:46,kmlmfm,E I E I E I O up the football league we go
11524,2020-12-29 21:26:41,kmlmfm,I retract everything I've just said as HMS Piss the Relegation Zone launches from the shipyard
11525,2020-12-29 21:27:13,kmlmfm,Sign up OG and the fog immediately
11526,2020-12-29 21:29:45,kmlmfm,[removed]
11527,2020-12-29 21:41:56,kmlmfm,The Mist 2 - you thought the first movie was depressing
11528,2020-12-29 21:44:22,kmlmfm,Has anyone made a joke about mist rolling in from the Trent yet?
11529,2020-12-29 21:55:28,kmlmfm,Would have taken a draw at the start...
11530,2020-12-29 21:58:02,kmlmfm,"Well,that wasn't worth watching in HD"
11531,2020-12-29 22:05:20,kmlmfm,Group hug we go again I’m off to rant into my empty cans
11532,2020-12-29 20:40:51,kmlmfm,"Mbe Soh out there scrolling through Neymar’s week long NYE party photos on the bench and glancing up to see Figs trying to shank in an OG off his fucking clown shoes. What the fuck am I doing here in shitting Stoke, with this shower of trash."
11533,2020-12-29 20:16:10,kmlmfm,"Joe Allen doesn’t look right with short hair, like a Saxon captured by Vikings and given a pashun trim before he meets Odin in Valhalla"
11534,2020-12-29 20:27:53,kmlmfm,grabban puts more effort into kneeling before the game and maintaining that shit beard than being captain of us
11535,2020-12-29 20:31:47,kmlmfm,That counts as a shot on target boys
11536,2020-12-29 20:34:02,kmlmfm,Feel like hughton had set Taylor as ‘target man’ and then forgot to take the instruction off for Grabban. We’ve all been there Chris.
11537,2020-12-29 20:36:35,kmlmfm,Can someone actually explain to me why Mbe Soh doesn't play or why Lolley has been so shit when he has played this season?
11538,2020-12-29 20:59:29,kmlmfm,"https://i.imgur.com/uyegRWH.gif

100%? Are you fucking joking?"
11539,2020-12-29 21:01:30,kmlmfm,"we need a creative player to sit deep and pick up the ball to get us going, silva would have been the man but hes fucked off. would honestly give freeman a go playing that deeper role if he wasn't half dead"
11540,2020-12-29 21:10:05,kmlmfm,"Christie’s best cross of the season, more of that!"
11541,2020-12-29 21:11:59,kmlmfm,Can this fog save us??? I mean it technically is mist rolling in from the Trent...
11542,2020-12-29 21:18:39,kmlmfm,"This fog is the best player we've got.

Plot twist, we go 2-1 up and the games gets called off because fog."
11543,2020-12-29 21:24:44,kmlmfm,nice of them to return the favour and score a goal for us
11544,2020-12-29 21:25:03,kmlmfm,Great own goal 😂
11545,2020-12-29 21:27:47,kmlmfm,We need an orange ball... at what point does this get called off??? Just our luck after finally playing well and getting an away goal!
11546,2020-12-29 21:27:56,kmlmfm,Hahaha I can’t see the ball anymore
11547,2020-12-29 21:28:10,kmlmfm,This level of vision is ridiculous lol
11548,2020-12-29 21:28:48,kmlmfm,Can’t see anything anymore!...best football I’ve seen all night 😂
11549,2020-12-29 21:32:06,kmlmfm,Anybody playing Spot the ball?
11550,2020-12-29 21:35:52,kmlmfm,Best £10 I've spent on Forest this season
11551,2020-12-29 21:46:51,kmlmfm,Imagine if we scored a second
11552,2020-12-29 20:11:59,kmlmfm,Looking more like last season (not the shit bit post lockdown) at the start. Some real _desiah_ and drive being shown.
11553,2020-12-29 20:20:03,kmlmfm,Classic
11554,2020-12-29 20:21:02,kmlmfm,What in the fuck was that?
11555,2020-12-29 20:21:06,kmlmfm,"Hahaha, we continue to surprise everyone with new levels of shittery"
11556,2020-12-29 20:21:16,kmlmfm,what the actual fuck
11557,2020-12-29 20:21:37,kmlmfm,That might be a new low for the season.
11558,2020-12-29 20:22:07,kmlmfm,"Lads, we've become a parody."
11559,2020-12-29 20:22:57,kmlmfm,Everybody on that team deserves a slap for that goal going in. That was genuinely awful!

11561,2020-12-29 20:23:51,kmlmfm,Hughton searching for his hip flask...to numb the pain
11562,2020-12-29 20:31:53,kmlmfm,We just do not look like scoring. Ever.
11563,2020-12-29 20:37:22,kmlmfm,does anyone even want to let hughton sign people in jan? nothing but dire football upto now
11564,2020-12-29 20:46:36,kmlmfm,Given Up Grabban
11565,2020-12-29 20:47:45,kmlmfm,"Who remembers when Watson and Grabban had a chance to counter at Barnsley in like the 92nd minute? That's the last time I was properly excited.

Knockers shanking a cross in and Yates scoring conversions with his head from 6 yards out mysteriously doesnt have the same effect."
11566,2020-12-29 20:53:17,kmlmfm,"just seen on twitter that Carvalho and Brennan have the same goal contributions (14) as the entire forest squad in the league so far, insane"
11567,2020-12-29 20:56:35,kmlmfm,"Fucking hell I didn’t expect promotion but I thought Hughton might have improved us a bit by now, every game now we produce nothing and concede braindead goals"

11570,2020-12-29 21:11:10,kmlmfm,"getting murky, having trouble seeing them play, oh no"
11571,2020-12-29 21:12:48,kmlmfm,Knockaert doing his best to get another red. Can't really blame him. I wouldn't want to play in this team either.
11572,2020-12-29 21:18:14,kmlmfm,Ameobi the white lines are the edge of the pitch mate
11573,2020-12-29 21:19:31,kmlmfm,It's looking like mist rolling in from the Trent out there
11574,2020-12-29 21:29:17,kmlmfm,we might be able to see samba sow on full throttle with this fog around to cover up his shithouse tackles
11575,2020-12-29 21:35:57,kmlmfm,There's some creative midfield genius at work in that fog...no really there is
11576,2020-12-29 21:55:40,kmlmfm,Samba not kicking the ball forward for a last chance there has really annoyed me.
11577,2020-12-29 20:01:44,kmlmfm,Grabban goal within 10 mins
11578,2020-12-29 20:01:46,kmlmfm,Hoping for a good game today!

11582,2020-12-29 20:12:04,kmlmfm,"Yates and Sow sitting way too deep when we've got the ball AS FUCKING USUAL.

God it's frustrating."
11583,2020-12-29 20:19:55,kmlmfm,I retract my last statement what the fuck Grabban you noob
11584,2020-12-29 20:20:01,kmlmfm,What a fucking mess of a goal
11585,2020-12-29 20:22:05,kmlmfm,"Doesn’t matter if he thinks it’s going to go out, clear it and don’t leave it to chance! Damn it Grabban!"
11586,2020-12-29 20:22:15,kmlmfm,As shit as Grabs was. Why the fuck didn’t Samba use his hands 🙌
11587,2020-12-29 20:23:09,kmlmfm,Grabban so awful. Should have pretended he had an injury for longer.
11588,2020-12-29 20:23:57,kmlmfm,I think I might neck the rest of the Christmas Sherry and put my Brazil 1970 tape on.
11589,2020-12-29 20:29:12,kmlmfm,I suppose we could just tell knockers to just aim for goal from corners. His delivery is the best thing we’ve got going for us
11590,2020-12-29 20:31:39,kmlmfm,We don't look or play as a team. Its like we've turned up and played for first time together
11591,2020-12-29 20:45:04,kmlmfm,Souttar looks like a fucking Harry Potter character. I just want to punch him for some reason.
11592,2020-12-29 20:45:53,kmlmfm,That’s why we’re loosing. We have more possession
11593,2020-12-29 21:14:21,kmlmfm,What's happened to Grabban this season? Fucking melt
11594,2020-12-29 21:14:51,kmlmfm,hopefully johnson is watching this and chucking any forest contacts that have his number on mute for the next month
11595,2020-12-29 21:17:38,kmlmfm,So angry I might get drunk and tweet abuse at Matt Forde

11597,2020-12-29 21:18:31,kmlmfm,I'd rather front more of the youth squad graduates. At least they've played together as a team...
11598,2020-12-29 21:18:46,kmlmfm,"Lets get Taylor on for Sow, 2 up top and just fucking get the ball forward ASAP at every opportunity.

we're losing but we still insist on twatting around when we have the ball."

11600,2020-12-29 21:24:16,kmlmfm,Knockers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
11601,2020-12-29 21:28:11,kmlmfm,Orange ball?
11602,2020-12-29 21:28:12,kmlmfm,"Finally at the 40th attempt someone got on the end of a cross. 

Better yet, this game is going to get called off at this rate with the fog. All of us get an early finish tonight."
11603,2020-12-29 21:30:55,kmlmfm,James Chester with a strong OG apparently.
11604,2020-12-29 21:46:27,kmlmfm,Gifted!!!!!
11605,2020-12-29 21:54:59,kmlmfm,At this point the best transfer business we could possibly do is to keep Knockers
11606,2020-12-29 21:49:42,kmlmfm,Stoke are better at keeping their shape and driving the lads back than a girl gang in a nightclub
11607,2020-12-29 20:00:43,kmlmfm,"Already 1 mention of that dreadful final game of last season (probably more and I just haven't been paying attention), Derby thrashed the team we failed to score against 3 days ago and even Sheffield Wednesday are fucking winning a game. Already a shit night for football, come on Forest make it better please."
11608,2020-12-29 20:16:03,kmlmfm,this is shocking already
11609,2020-12-29 20:17:08,kmlmfm,So 0-0 is best case yet again?

11640,2020-12-29 21:54:13,kmlmfm,Yea Taylor was free. I was screaming at the TV
11641,2020-12-29 20:56:53,kmlmfm,Funny innit
11642,2020-12-29 20:57:15,kmlmfm,"As with Kings called William, 3rd time is the charm"
11643,2020-12-29 20:02:32,kmlmfm,Tonight they can change that 😃
11644,2020-12-29 20:51:55,kmlmfm,Literally 10/11 of our players are 180cm or above! We're just that uncommitted in the challenge that we may as well lose a foot. Sometimes literally (see: Sameobi v Connor Roberts)
11645,2020-12-29 20:54:19,kmlmfm,I was curious about this earlier so just looked and I'm pretty sure that unless I missed one that all of our players on the pitch are at least 6 foot apart from Knockaert who takes our setpieces. Wouldn't think that though when the tallest of them can be outjumped by a 5'8 Swansea wing-back and they don't try clearing corners. We're such a weird team.
11646,2020-12-29 20:59:13,kmlmfm,"I didn't think it was ever a smart decision. The role he plays isolated up front, he can hardly do those captainy things that Watson did. Should be Worrall, should always have been Worrall (and then maybe Yates in a few years >_>). When the goal went in, it was Joe shouting the loudest, and with the most pashun."
11647,2020-12-29 20:10:43,kmlmfm,There are other subs?
11648,2020-12-29 21:09:15,kmlmfm,No thanks we’d only have to play it again
11649,2020-12-29 21:19:38,kmlmfm,Our squad is 22 blokes just looking to cover their own arse. They'd make a fantastic cabinet.
11650,2020-12-29 21:32:33,kmlmfm,"Nah, we'll take the lead, be cruising into the last 5 minutes heading for a win...


...and then it'll get abandoned"

11653,2020-12-29 20:17:58,kmlmfm,What a sentence
11654,2020-12-29 20:31:19,kmlmfm,Watch him sign for Stoke in 6 days
11655,2020-12-29 21:13:26,kmlmfm,Negative vibes only pls
11656,2020-12-29 21:54:33,kmlmfm,Didn't imagine hard enough lads
11657,2020-12-29 20:24:34,kmlmfm,Some blames also got to go to grabban for just moving out the way of the ball too.
11658,2020-12-29 20:24:18,kmlmfm,Or his handgun. If this team was a dog you’d shoot it
11659,2020-12-29 20:32:55,kmlmfm,"That was a Yates header on target just now

From outside the box, but on target"
11660,2020-12-29 20:33:59,kmlmfm,Not in their net anyway...
11661,2020-12-29 20:40:05,kmlmfm,Rooting for Covid to cancel the season at this point.
11662,2020-12-29 20:41:08,kmlmfm,"Mate, this team has been dire since March. Lost good players, brought in mostly average ones. It ain't on Hughton."
11663,2020-12-29 20:47:25,kmlmfm,Yes I get the same feeling. He is just waiting for his free flight to UAE
11664,2020-12-29 20:49:08,kmlmfm,Big Kenny was right all along. I'll never call him a fat jock ever again
11665,2020-12-29 21:05:08,kmlmfm,Hungover Scots having a pint and fag at half time during Sunday League > Forest this year
11666,2020-12-29 21:04:44,kmlmfm,Yeah not bad thanks. I've only just finished eating the roast goose which was amazing. You?
11667,2020-12-29 21:05:01,kmlmfm,Not to bad man! What about you? ⛄️
11668,2020-12-29 21:07:30,kmlmfm,"Pretty decent, worked for the first half of the day but got a fair amount for that then enjoyed the rest of the day tired af just stuffing my face. How about yours?"
11669,2020-12-29 21:30:28,kmlmfm,Only one on the pitch who can do a foggy Tuesday night in Stoke
11670,2020-12-29 20:04:36,kmlmfm,"I tried cigars at uni, couldn’t do it - I’m too much of a social smoker and just ended up looking like a choking xG nonce trying to look quirky"
11671,2020-12-29 20:07:48,kmlmfm,I swear there was a 90 second period there (Sky) where the commentators didn't even say anything lol
11672,2020-12-29 20:11:42,kmlmfm,"Same here, I really struggle to want to watch games these days."
11673,2020-12-29 20:14:51,kmlmfm,Exactly. There’s 40 yards between them and cafu/grabban.
11674,2020-12-29 20:25:16,kmlmfm,"Why did Grabbs not clear it, why did Samba not command his area...

Mistakes were made, corner flag is being installed"
11675,2020-12-29 21:19:09,kmlmfm,‘Useful’ is a bit generous
11676,2020-12-29 21:25:36,kmlmfm,It was a massive crash nice to our boys helping.
11677,2020-12-29 22:12:56,kmlmfm,"He's clearly a good, if slightly misfiring, player, but he also hasn't done enough to justify his cost IMO.

His high energy play isn't matched by anyone else in our team, so it's almost like he's playing a different game to the rest of them."
11678,2020-12-30 02:04:49,kmlmfm,He's on a LOT of money
11679,2020-12-30 03:30:10,kmlmfm,Would rather start Lollerz
11680,2020-12-29 21:59:22,kmlmfm,"Meh, take it or leave it for me"
11681,2020-12-29 22:03:37,kmlmfm,"We can't keep him. Fulham want like £10m for him and we can't afford that, unlikely that we'll be allowed to take him on loan either as why would they want to advertise his ability using the team that is 21st in the league? His wages are apparently ridiculous anyway especially for what he offers us, need to look elsewhere."
11682,2020-12-29 20:20:11,kmlmfm,I’d take that now wtf
11683,2020-12-29 20:25:50,kmlmfm,"Livestreamed from a crackden in Sneinton, me you coolica and some of the other big shitposters autistically screeching at the stream"
11684,2020-12-29 20:31:07,kmlmfm,Tbf that is definitely Grabbans fault
11685,2020-12-29 20:35:09,kmlmfm,"Was banging on and on about how he's PL quality last year, can't say it with a straight face anymore. Used to just exude confidence bordering on cockiness.

Think he's a keeper for the good times, but his confidence has obviously been knocked by the rest of the team being poor. Can't have that from a keeper, theyve got to be reliable.

Tbh its the same weaknesses as last year - hes small and has obviously been taught to punch *everything*. Maybe opposition teams have just started doing their homework, maybe our lack of confidence just exposed them more. Who knows."
11686,2020-12-29 21:56:54,kmlmfm,Both.
11687,2020-12-29 21:56:05,kmlmfm,He’s a CB
11688,2020-12-30 03:29:40,kmlmfm,I feel he's been improving on the whole (and I'm one of his critics)
11689,2020-12-29 21:05:40,kmlmfm,My brother said that when he opened the second bottle of whiskey
11690,2020-12-29 21:03:49,kmlmfm,I'd even let him wail on any photographer that looked at him funny. And remember when Jim Price sounded dangerously unqualified for the job? Oh what heady days.
11691,2020-12-29 21:19:52,kmlmfm,"That's only 5,9 one of their cbs is 6,7!

edit: Okay I google lied to me I'm sorry

edit2: I'm not wrong?"
11692,2020-12-29 20:12:46,kmlmfm,I occasionally wander over to this place called r/Championship but they’re very hit and miss on the memes
11693,2020-12-29 20:18:57,kmlmfm,I ducking love this have a internet point
11694,2020-12-29 20:33:37,kmlmfm,I know. He can’t get them on target from 6 yards. But >20 he’s all over it
11695,2020-12-29 20:54:28,kmlmfm,Do Rotherham not have better PPG than we do? Surely we'd be down with Weds & Wycombe
11696,2020-12-29 20:44:06,kmlmfm,"plenty of teams far more average than ours on paper doing just fine, largely because they're encouraged to go forwards i imagine"
11697,2020-12-29 20:46:02,kmlmfm,"Can’t say Hughton is the cause of our problems, sure.  Can’t say he’s helping much either"
11698,2020-12-29 21:11:56,kmlmfm,Shitting in my hands and clapping > Forest
11699,2020-12-29 21:07:34,kmlmfm,Aunty’s copper boyfriend didn’t falsely accuse my brother of smoking weed on Christmas Day this year and I’ve still got snacks left over so there’s that
11700,2020-12-29 21:08:22,kmlmfm,Was decent! slept a lot drank a lot didn’t watch Forest a lot so I’m well rested for five more months of this shit
11701,2020-12-29 21:10:26,kmlmfm,"Lovely stuff

Woke up, cracked cans, ate food, went to look after our animals, rinse and repeat till collapse"
11702,2020-12-29 20:10:13,kmlmfm,I'm a Da at heart so it goes with my slippers and whisky
11703,2020-12-29 20:11:12,kmlmfm,Good
11704,2020-12-29 20:30:58,kmlmfm,Why can't we score? Why is Cafu in the team? Why do I support Forest?
11705,2020-12-29 21:23:47,kmlmfm,"The least gash, maybe?"
11706,2020-12-29 23:17:24,kmlmfm,"Exactly, without him we’d be in the relegation places. Are we _serious about promotion_ or not?"
11707,2020-12-29 20:28:18,kmlmfm,Can see it now. Before we know it we’re in the front car park getting pelted with Heineken bottles and kebab wrappers for making Vrentzos cry
11708,2020-12-29 20:32:59,kmlmfm,"Will do more maniacal laughing than anything, fucking comedy show this club only right I match the energy."
11709,2020-12-29 20:35:11,kmlmfm,Both at fault for me. Grabban actively moves out of the way instead of heading it clear. Brice at that point should be punching it away. Instead it hits him and goes in. Standard Nottingham Forest defending.
11710,2020-12-29 20:38:48,kmlmfm,hasn't been the same since his mate sabri departed
11711,2020-12-29 21:46:21,kmlmfm,In my head 180 is 5 11 bordering on 6?
11712,2020-12-29 20:14:41,kmlmfm,They don’t get the bants over there
11713,2020-12-29 20:42:46,kmlmfm,"If only we could trade internet points for league points, we’d be running away with it"
11714,2020-12-29 20:59:26,kmlmfm,Fingers crossed for null and void.
11715,2020-12-29 20:45:17,kmlmfm,Largely because they've been playing together for a while and are a team unit I imagine.
11716,2020-12-29 20:32:27,kmlmfm,We’re good at drinking GUJ despite the magic powers never actually working so there’s that
11717,2020-12-29 20:31:32,kmlmfm,Standing with a microphone outside the Trent End while someone's dad screams about King Billy
11718,2020-12-29 20:38:21,kmlmfm,"The cast is you laughing like you're on day release, me throwing chicken tendies, and R5555 just ranting the home truths"
11719,2020-12-29 20:41:12,kmlmfm,I don’t think there is any circumstance where Grabban shouldn’t head that out ANYWHERE. Brice didn’t have long enough to react Cus there was no way in his mind Grabban would do that
11720,2020-12-29 22:13:41,kmlmfm,"Well idk if google says 5,9 but I’m sure Americans use different size inches to us so who knows"

Bottling promotion isn’t all bad"
11723,2020-12-29 20:43:27,kmlmfm,We would still bottle it 😆

11745,2020-12-29 20:47:49,kmk6uk,I wonder how many shots per game each of the players took in those seasons
11746,2020-12-30 01:24:34,kmk6uk,Malone really was amazing god damn
11747,2020-12-29 22:02:22,kmk6uk,"50 points per game for 82 games will do that for you.

11771,2020-12-29 13:54:44,kmdh9j,"This assumes you're paying for performance over a passing rating of zero (and assumes that if you weren't paying the QB, you'd save all the salary instead of having to pay at least minimum league wage). Probably would be a little more meaningful if you compared to a baseline of a replacement level FA making vet minimum. So subtract vet minimum from the salary and subtract the QB rating you'd expect with a replacement level FA (not sure what that would be, maybe a 50?)"
11772,2020-12-29 14:07:15,kmdh9j,"The problem with this is that you only start 1 QB and QB goodness doesn’t scale linearly

11788,2020-12-29 17:42:13,kmdh9j,It's cherry picked to not use cap hit IMO.  Signing bonuses still can't be used on the rest of the team.

11791,2020-12-29 16:17:35,kmdh9j,Well people want to give him a second chance because he was good for 3 years and now hes been sucking for one year but we need to give a guy with a 120mil contract and 30 mil cap hit a second chance unless you want to have huge cap hit for years or a shit contract
11792,2020-12-29 11:46:14,kmc3rk,Yea this definitely screams casual fan lol.    Well written and all but this is gonna get eviscerated.
11793,2020-12-29 12:36:31,kmc3rk,"I think you overvalue our players in the trade market.  Nobody is going to give up anything for guys like Proche, Boykin, and Ingram.  

Proche has done a fine job returning for one.  There’s no reason to let a 2nd year player walk who is only an $800k cap hit; especially when they’re already showing value their rookie year.  

Boykin is also a low cap hit at $1.06 mill.  While he might not be the number 2 WR we hoped for, he’s a more than capable blocker and if you told me a WR would cost $1mill next season and catch have 250 yards and 3-4 TDs and he’s a great run blocker on the outside, I think any GM would take that value."

11796,2020-12-29 12:19:32,kmc3rk,No one is going to want Ingram dude. More than likely he will retire after this year or take a vet minimum somewhere else but its more than likely he will retire.

11798,2020-12-29 14:04:59,kmc3rk,Damn so you just gonna trade the whole team because they had one bad year 😂
11799,2020-12-29 14:14:04,kmc3rk,Yeesh.
11800,2020-12-29 12:54:56,kmc3rk,Bonds aint even on the team anymore bruh
11801,2020-12-29 11:42:08,kmc3rk,"No. More. WRs.

We have enough and given our track record on developing WRs, we should look to bringing in outside talent. However, we have Dez, Snead, Hollywood, Boykin, Duvernay, and some more rotational guys mostly for ST.  

We have some serious needs. No Pass Rushers once Judon leaves in FA and Ngakoue is far from certainly staying on. No free safety exposing our CBs.

So here’s the plan. Tag Judon and package him and Trace with our first round pick to the Jets for the second overall pick. Take Penei Sewell with that pick. 

We need to keep Cox. Paying him at pro bowl LS price is no big bother."
11802,2020-12-29 12:47:11,kmc3rk,I stopped reading at trade Ingram. There is no team in the league that will give up even a 7th for him.
11803,2020-12-29 12:55:13,kmc3rk,"This dude said trade nick Boyle

Posted to r/ThisAintMadden"
11804,2020-12-29 12:27:47,kmc3rk,"You do realize other teams need to agree to trades right?  

On what planet would the Jets bring in Matt Judon and his $19million tag, and give up the #2 overall pick?   Why would a rebuilding team bring on a guy who will be 29 when the season starts and will be regressing once they are competitive again, when they can draft a 21 year old cornerstone LT who they can control for the next half decade?"
11805,2020-12-29 12:34:58,kmc3rk,Jets are definitely not giving up the second pick
11806,2020-12-29 14:50:19,kmc3rk,Also said Ingram’s been here a long time.
11807,2020-12-29 12:52:43,kmc3rk,Ong bruh
11808,2020-12-29 16:02:15,kmc3rk,That sub is so sad
11809,2020-12-29 12:47:32,kmc3rk,"Becton just doesn’t exist? They don’t have real holes on their defense? The Jets don’t import old Ravens like gold?

They have more than enough cap space for Judon’s tag and will likely roll with Darnold another year. Bringing in Trace gives them a decent back up QB to compete for the game manager job. Furthermore, they’ve had some lackluster pass rushing and have an immediate need for Judon and some DT help."
11810,2020-12-29 12:44:42,kmc3rk,Right now the general belief on the Jets sub is that they trade down with the Bengals for their third round pick.
11811,2020-12-29 15:48:15,kmc3rk,"Taking all that into account, it’s still very, very stupid.  

Why wouldn’t they trade for a better, cheaper DE?  Von Miller is about to be released.  Shaq Barrett is in the same position as Judon.  They could get Cam Jordan for that pick.  JJ Watt.  Or they could trade for a handful of picks with a QB needy team, and take a few players to help the rebuild.  

If their GM traded the number 2 overall pick for Judon, he would be out of a job before the day was done."

11819,2020-12-29 04:30:56,km70mh,Just be a Manning basically
11820,2020-12-29 04:35:27,km70mh,I think Brady screws this up a bit. I wonder how many #1OA and 1st rd QBs never made a SB appearance because of Brady/Belichick.
11821,2020-12-29 04:35:17,km70mh,I think the overall #1 pick is more about making people/media happy than making the pick you feel comfortable about. And for the first round in general. When you don't have a good qb people would flame you for not drafting Rosen or Haskins.  Yet you could've gotten better value at other positions or went to free agency.
11822,2020-12-29 04:27:25,km70mh,"So the only ones who have won or had success are generational talents like Peyton Manning and while Eli was not generational, he was still a great prospect.

I am comfy if I am the Jags but just make sure you don't hire an idiot like Louis Riddick as your GM or something."
11823,2020-12-29 04:29:29,km70mh,Hitting on draft picks is critical.
11824,2020-12-29 04:54:47,km70mh,brady ruins any kind of stats analysis you want to do here by being an absolute anomaly
11825,2020-12-29 04:47:42,km70mh,"All that work for me to think ""yeah... no shit""

Strong work though OP.  I like your analysis. If only to prove a Michigan QB has been in more SB's hands down in the last 20 years."
11826,2020-12-29 05:20:59,km70mh,Only one of those SB doesn't have a 1st round QB or 6th round QB.
11827,2020-12-29 05:25:02,km70mh,"Also, since the AFL-NFL merger of 1970:  
    
There have been 25 #1OA QBs.  
    
Six have won SB games: Bradshaw, Plunkett, Elway, Aikman, and the Manning brothers.  Plunkett and Eli won with teams that didn't originally draft them.  
    
Nineteen haven't won SBs: Bartkowski, Testaverde, George, Bledsoe (has a ring but didn't play in XXXVI), Couch, Vick, Carr, Palmer, Smith, Russell, Stafford, Bradford, Newton, Luck, Winston, Goff, Mayfield, Murray and Burrow.  Obviously some, especially the last four, could still become SB-winning QBs."
11828,2020-12-29 11:29:13,km70mh,"Your math is correct but your logic is flawed.

Especially your statement saying non #1s have better #s on average.  That is simply not true.  The problem is that you overlooked that there are far more non #1 compare to #1.  So you actually have to look at the chance of an individual non #1 getting to SB vs #1 getting to SB.  Since there are around 5-7 QBs drafted per year, and not each year has a QB at number 1 (especially in the early 2000s), you actually have better ratio on a per QB basis for #1 picks.

It is the same reason that 15/20 SBs feature 1st round picks, most QBs (especially recently) are drafted in the first round because their value is so high that people will pick ‘project’ QBs in the first.  So like 1/2 of the league is 1st rounder, is it that surprising that at least 1 makes the SB?

Also, #1 picks have a disadvantage that they are going to worse teams.  Imagine if Trevor Lawerence was drafted by say the dolphins, Colts, Rams next year, they would be instantly one of the top contenders for SB.

Did you know that out of 12 QBs who have won multiple SBs, 6 are #1 OA. Plunket, Bradshaw, Aikman, Elway, Payton and Eli.  That is pretty good odds consider the #1 to non #1 ratio.

So while having the #1 OA is no where near guaranteed SB success.  It is still by far the best individual picking slot for a team in terms of winning SBs."
11829,2020-12-29 12:23:55,km70mh,Former Jets fan? Couldn’t take the heat? Lmao
11830,2020-12-29 04:27:55,km70mh,No draft pick is a sure thing
11831,2020-12-29 04:45:32,km70mh,Brady is gonna skew any analysis you do to the point where you might as well not do it.
11832,2020-12-29 06:25:27,km70mh,Jags taking Cooper lock it in
11833,2020-12-29 04:38:39,km70mh,One helluva butterfly effect if Brady got sacked instead of the incomplete pass eh or if the Jets player missed Bledsoe
11834,2020-12-29 05:55:17,km70mh,"Brady and the Pats screw all of this analysis up.

If you look at the past 20 years the best way to get the super bowl is to have the best coach and quarterback of all time on the same team.

Also, the Pats used a first round pick to get that coach."
11835,2020-12-29 04:38:03,km70mh,"1st rounders, sure (Rivers comes to mind), but tbf the list of #1OA QBs that didn't make it isn't exactly spectacular. There's a few great ones (Luck, early-career Vick, Stafford, late-career Palmer), but most were varying degrees of above-average to bad."
11836,2020-12-29 08:45:13,km70mh,I can think of one...
11837,2020-12-29 04:39:17,km70mh,"Goff, Peyton, and Luck are the ones he has beaten in the playoffs IIRC"
11838,2020-12-29 04:33:58,km70mh,"In short, just be a Manning.

Even other ""generational"" prospects like Luck and Vick never made it. Lawrence/Jacksonville's success will hinge almost entirely on the Jags' ability to build around him, which tbf was gonna be questionable regardless of where he went."
11839,2020-12-29 13:17:59,km70mh,So Jags should skip Lawrence and start drafting all their QBs in the 6th round?
11840,2020-12-30 04:19:29,km70mh,"Spot on. Also, not all #1s are the same. Consensus generational guys like Peyton are very different to  flyers/“best” available like Goff. Lawrence is clearly a greater value than your average #1OA QB pick."
11841,2020-12-29 11:40:39,km70mh,"It isn’t just due to Brady.  Problem is the OP is putting #1 OV vs rest of the field.  Of course the rest of the field wins.

I mean the Chiefs are the favorites to win the SB this year but even their odds are around 1 in 3 (+180).  So if you ask me to pick between the Chiefs and rest of the field, it is a no brainer."
11842,2020-12-29 04:44:25,km70mh,"McNabb, Rivers, Bortles, and Ryan are the only other 1st-rounders I can think of off the top of my head, although I'm sure there's been others."
11843,2020-12-29 04:35:07,km70mh,"Luck retired early and was fucked by terrible FO management, and Vick can read a defense as well as Floyd Mayweather can read a book."
11844,2020-12-29 05:21:27,km70mh,And Vick lost several seasons in his prime due to non-football issues.

&nbsp;  
**Chapter Two** – **ROoTh** [Ruth] **picks** [מלקטת, *MeLahQehTehTh*] **in field Bo`ahZ** [Boaz]  
&nbsp;  

-1. And to Nah'ahMeeY [""My Pleasure"", Naomi] was a **kinsman** [מודע, *MODah'*] to her husband,  

**a man brave and** ***forceful***,  

from [the] **family** of ’ehLeeY-MehLehKh [""My God is King"", Elimelech],  

and his name, Bo`ahZ.  
&nbsp;  

>“The word **kinsman** (*môdha‘*) occurs only here (but cf. [compare with] 3:2 and Prov. [Proverbs] 7:4, where it parallels ‘sister’).  … Naomi’s kinsman was **a mighty man of wealth**… In David’s day both terms were applied to warriors, as the class most important to the community.  In later Hebrew the words mean ‘honorable,’ ‘distinguished’ for any reason.  The second term, *ḥáyil*, is used in connection with Ruth herself (3:11) and the ideal woman of Prov. 31:10… The word **family** is used in the widest sense: in early times an important social unit (I Sam. [Samuel] 20:6, 29), but less significant later; it occurs only once in Deuteronomy.  In the prophets (Amos 3:1; Jer. [Jeremiah] 8:3; etc.) it is used as a synonym for ‘nation.’  The older use was revived by P [the priestly redaction]… since one of the pillars in front of Solomon’s temple bore the name of **Boaz**… it probably had cultic significance, but the derivation is uncertain.” (Smith, 1953, p. II 839)  
&nbsp;  

-2. And said, ROoTh the Moabitess, unto Nah`ahMeeY [""My Pleasure"", Naomi],  

“I will walk, if you please [נא, *Nah’*], [to] the field,  

and I will ***pick*** *in ears of* ***corn*** [בשבלים, *BahSheeBahLeeYM*], after that I find grace in his eyes.”  

And she said to her, “Go, my daughter.”  
&nbsp;  

>“**Glean** (**לקט** [*LahQahT*]), ‘gather up,’ ‘pick up,’… The law requiring that grain and fruit should not be gathered to the last stalk appears first in Deut. [Deuteronomy] 24:19-21, and the verb itself appears in Leviticus.  The scantiness of the leftover gleanings is referred to in Isa. [Isaiah] 17:5-6.  **Corn**: ‘grain’ in American usage.” (Smith, 1953, p. II 839)  
&nbsp;  

>“*Glean ears of corn*] the word *glean* comes from the French *glaner*, to gather ears, or grains of corn.” (Adam Clarke, 1831, p. II 95)  
&nbsp;  

-3. And she walked and came and picked in a field after the harvesters,  

**happened** [by] **happenstance** [ויקר מקרה, *VahYeeQehR MeeQReH*] [upon] a portion of the field to Bo`ahZ,
that from family of ’ehLeeY-MehLehKh.  
&nbsp;  

>“**Her hap was to light** means ‘her chance chanced.’  The perplexity which this phrase caused worthy Thomas Fuller (1650) – ‘How does the Holy Spirit use a profane term? Does not God rule?’… - would have been lessened if he had consulted the other biblical occurrences of the expression.  Only in I Sam. 6:9 is there any contrast between **קרה** [*QaRaH*, “happened”] and the will of God and this corresponds to Philistine theology!” (Smith, 1953, pp. II 839-840)  
&nbsp;  

-4. And behold, Bo`ahZ came from BayTh-LehHehM,  

and said to harvesters,  

“YHVH with you.”  

And they said to him,  

“Bless you, YHVH.”  
&nbsp;  

>“The servant’ response recalls Ps. [Psalm]  129:8.” (Smith, 1953, p. II 840)  
&nbsp;  

-5. And said, Bo`ahZ, to his youth, the stationed upon the harvesters,  

“To whom is the youth the that?”  

-6. And answered, the youth, the stationed upon the harvesters, and said,  

“A youth Moabitess is she,  

returned with Nah`ahMeeY from Field MO’ahB.”  
&nbsp;  

>“Boaz does not ask who the woman is, as though she had an identity, but whose she is, indicating that she is possessed by someone else, a man.  The foreman’s reply is in keeping with the question.  Ruth is not named; rather, her place of origin and her family connection with Israel define her.” (Laffey, 1990, p. 556)  
&nbsp;  

-7. “And she said,  

‘I will pick, if you please,  

and gather in sheaves of corn [בעמרים, *Bah`ahMahReeYM*] after the harvesters.’  

And she came and stood from then the morning and until now this [ועד עתה זה, Ve`ahD `ahThaH ZeH],  
 
**She sat** [in] the house little.”  
&nbsp;  

>“**That she tarried**: The original text for this clause is uncertain.  There… must have been… some kind of shelter under which the workers sat for lunch, and where a few minutes’ relief from the sun could be found… the context suggests that Boaz sees her and asks about her because she is at the moment resting in the shade where he and his servant are consulting.” (Smith, 1953, pp. II 840-841)  
&nbsp;  

-8. And said Bo`ahZ unto ROoTh,  

“Do you not hear, my daughter?  

Do not walk to pick in a field other,  

and also do not pass from this,  

and thus you cleave with my youths [feminine].  

-9. Your eyes in [the] field that they harvest,  

and walk **after them**.  
&nbsp;  

>“**After them**: The pronoun is feminine in Hebrew, referring to the maidens who bind the sheaves… (Smith, 1953, p. II 841)  
&nbsp;  

“Did I not command [את, *’ehTh* (indicator of direct object; no English equivalent)] the youths [masculine] to not touch you?  

And you thirst,  

and walk unto the vessels,  

and drink from that [which] drew [ישאבון, *YeeSh’ahBOoN*] the youths.”  
&nbsp;  

>“Since the water had to be drawn and carried to the field from the village well … the jars were not free to all comers.” (Smith, 1953, p. II 841)  
&nbsp;  

-10. And she fell upon her face,  

and worshiped him landward,  

and she said unto him,  

“Why did I find grace in your eyes,  

to **recognize** me,  

and I an **alien**?”  
&nbsp;  

>“**Take knowledge** … **stranger** in Hebrew involves a play on words…” (Smith, 1953, p. II 841) [להכירני *LeHahKeeYRayNeeY*, “to recognize me”… נכריה, *NaKhReeYaH*, “alien”]

11946,2020-12-28 12:51:33,klpgt4,"I want to offer you a serious reply, but I have to start with he joke of “she wants kids, but doesn’t want sex?”

My wife and I started dating in 2003, married in 2009. Our DB started prior to us being married, but it was disguised as a religious issue. She suddenly was not comfortable with premarital sex. So she begins to pressure me for children in 2012. I was in school and our bedroom and marriage was basically dead. I told her we had some issues to resolve and I wasn’t even sure our marriage would survive and I wasn’t going to bring a kid into that environment. Well, she suddenly had her sexual desire back. She worked on a few thing on her end and we started having sex every other day in hopes of a child. She must have gotten pregnant the first time we did it and we had a girl in 2013. The first year things got way worse than they were before. I lost my wife all together. I now had a business partner that wasn’t very kind at all. Eventually she starts wanting a second and it was all the same stuff. I expressed my concerns, she got better, we had a boy in 2015. I started posting here in 2018 and at the end of 2019 I asked for a divorce. Me asking for a divorce wrecked her. I think she finally saw the light. She worked on herself and we started being husband and wife again. We have been in recovery this year, but its been tough. The last month has been really bad and I feel like she is sliding back to where she was. 

Do not bring children into this. Children make life very difficult and add a lot of stress. You and her need to make serious changes and ensure that those changes last for at least a year or more before bringing in children."
11947,2020-12-28 14:32:06,klpgt4,"50sHLM, DB 20+ Married 15+

you can't help your partner if they won't agree to help themselves.

I married into a DB, had kids in a DB, now I'm to live a celibate life until my exit plan has been activated, I guess?

that sad feeling you get when watching a movie with sex in it?  that's your future LIFE.  you will look and think about lingerie ads, movie scenes, PDAs on the street, coworkers, friends, exes, and you will burn and rage and howl inside at how you're trapped in this impossible situation, completely dependent on your partner for the only thing that can sate this thirst.  it's a feeling that will stay with you, bubbling under the surface and it will poison your entire life, and make you deeply resent your partner.  

you need to be wanted, desired.

she can't be what you need.

don't be me, don't marry or have kids with someone who doesn't desire you.

I hope you find a better path to your happiness."
11948,2020-12-28 16:52:28,klpgt4,You are right to say no kids.  100%.  Right now you can leave her and just lose half of what you accumulated while married.  Have a kid and she will never be out of your life.  She will be in your wallet for decades.
11949,2020-12-28 13:02:22,klpgt4,"""If things end up in divorce, I want to know that we really tried EVERYTHING""

She is resistant to counseling, books etc... Because she is satisfied with the DB. You can try as hard as you want but if she isn't trying just as hard as you (she isn't because she doesn't care) nothing will change.

She'll give you just enough sex to reach her goals which is having children. But she won't give you enough to be your intimate partner.

""act like you love me"".

She doesn't see that a DB would cause so much resentment it will bleed into other parts of the relationship. She knows exactly what you want but doesn't care that you are hurting over it.

She can't even bring herself to think about why you are at a point that she has to tell you to fake it.

If you have been reading posts on here, do take note of the ones who are long married and stuck because of children. It's a long, slow, painful loneliness to have to go through and lots of wasted years.

She may need individual therapy just to help her with her own stuff. It doesn't seem good that after only 3 years she can't remember what sleeping with you is like, and that would worry me that she wasn't even lucid during those times."

11955,2020-12-28 15:10:12,klpgt4,">She feels like she is ""trying"" in her own way

Make sure she understands that trying isn't good enough, especially when her version of trying seems to be more involved in resisting any actual efforts to improve the situation.

Put an expiration date on it. Make sure she understands you will leave her in six months unless this actually gets resolved.   No more ""trying"".    If she wants this marriage last, she chooses to be fully vested in any options to help her solve this, and she takes personal accountability for making sure it actually gets fixed."

I’d say the same goes for men."
11971,2020-12-28 18:01:07,klpgt4,"I'd also consider ""how"" things improved.  If they improved because you set up a set of behaviors or ceremonies having kids will mess things up logistically if those ceremonies are not easy to modify. And the logistics keep changing.

We were actually ok, until the kids started staying up later... like 6-8.  We're back to ok again, but it required a change of mindset to get back to good again... but it required a lot of mental flexibility on my wife's part to reframe sex as something we can have when the opportunity presents itself instead of something we have because we made the opportunity... 

Just be aware that even if the frequency increases, if the attitude hasn't... bringing kids in will just screw everything up again.  Not saying you shouldn't have kids... it's amazing... but it's definitely something that tests even healthy sexual relationships."

She is well informed about the issue.  She knows things that MIGHT help.  She knows that the current state is causing you emotional pain.

However, she values her current comfort more than your suffering.

Read that again.

She values her current level of comfort in the relationship MORE than she values you not having to suffer by healing things back to what they once we're.

She feels that she is entitled to the relationship enough that she need not put in any corrective effort or be honest with you about how she no longer has any actual sexual desire for you, but not only wants you to stay in the relationship with her, but also EXPECTS YOU TO ACT LIKE THERE IS NOTHING WRONG!

Entitlement.  She doesn't believe that a relationship is worth any of her effort.

So, what will it be?  A shit sandwich with someone you love, or door number one?"
11975,2020-12-28 18:46:57,klpgt4,"I urge you to reconsider.  the above comment is correct - you need to seek professional legal advice that is relevant to your situation and location.

you need this information to form your exit plan.  There may be things you can nudge into motion today that will put you in a better position when you're finally ready to file for divorce down the road.

assume your partner will be adversarial during divorce.  what would that look like to you?

you should invest in a consultation with an attorney, and go from there.

maybe you don't get anything from the consultation, but you still needed to know that information to continue your exit plan.

I wish you a better path to your happiness."
11976,2020-12-29 00:54:33,klpgt4,"Hoping to do it without lawyers is fine - even better if the both of you can remain amicable and actually do so.

But don't bank on that.  Have at least a consult (usually free) with an attorney to get a baseline understanding of what the legalities of a separation would look like, and as the poster below pointed out, to begin positioning yourself for a better outcome just in case she chooses to fight instead."
11977,2020-12-28 18:51:55,klpgt4,"Telemedicine is much more prevalent these days and often covered by insurance. You may have options. 

That being said, the situation sounds very unsustainable, esp. the part about you feeling like you no longer love her. If she isn’t willing to do the work to fix the DB, she’s certainly not willing to do what it takes to win back your love, she just assumes love has no conditions whatsoever or that they aren’t different for each person, that is simply not the case. All her conditions are being met so she wants to move forward. She seems to not understand or care that yours are not being met.

You are 100% right about not having kids."

11979,2020-12-28 19:02:40,klpgt4,"Think of it less as an ultimatum and more as fair warning.   The DB and her resistance to fixing it have made you unhappy in the marriage - unhappy enough that you are losing your love for her. If this is not corrected soon, you will choose to leave her over it.

You are not trying to control her actions. You are informing her of the reality of the situation, and highlighting the choice that she needs to make and its consequences. It's still her choice. You're not making it for her , but you are telling her what your own choice will be in response.

Don't let her continue to stall and find yourself still in the same boat in another 3, 5, or 20 years."

11987,2020-12-29 01:25:26,klpgt4,"You're right - and in the past I've pretty much made such a warning in that telling her a DB would be a dealbreaker, but without an expiration date. I guess I just feel bad about it, I care about her and don't want to make her sad."
11988,2020-12-29 15:10:08,klpgt4,Its good that you care about her and don't want to hurt her. The problem is that she doesn't return that sentiment - and the relationship cannot work unless she chooses to change that.

11993,2020-12-27 18:06:42,kl6vdt,"""It's opening day at The Ralph! And yet another sunny one here in the blasted desert that makes up the state of Arizona. High of 95, low of 53, sunny ALL DAY today and the Arizona Diamondbacks are going to be defending The Ralph under new management, a new Head GM, but for once it's actually a calm and natural transition of power in the front office, with Alexander West as GM, Pitching Coach, and the Opening Day Starter!""  


""Talk about wearing a lot of hats! Speaking of hats, I'm Steve Berthiaume giving you the play-by-play, and next to me in the booth, but with a 6-foot distance between us so I don't sniff his BO is B-O-B Brenly for Analysis, and you're watching FOX Sports Arizona! The national anthem has been sung, the D-Backs are taking the field again, and we are looking at the very first game of a new season of MLR Baseball! But the question on everyone's mind is, where is Alexander We-""  


The Ralph began to vibrate, and a heat-mirage began to vibrate in midair above the mound. The very mound itself seemed to glow with heat, and a small pinprick of a hole opened up, hanging in space. Through the hole, a faint howling of the wind began to echo around the park, growing in volume until the hole WIDENED. The hole stretched itself, growing to 10 feet in width, and stretching 30 feet into the air, a gate to an alien landscape. Even more disturbing than the strange sight of a blood-red sky, and a desolate wasteland of blackened earth was the endless of wailing, anguished souls, only drowned out by the [thunderous drumming and aggressive shredding of guitars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6bgZDk1dWY) by some unknown, infernal musicians.  


Through the portal stepped a figure cloaked in robes. With a wave of his skeletal hand, the music ceased, and the screaming portal into unknown hellscapes snapped shut as if it had never been there. The only visible difference was the ballpark stands, previously emptied by order of the State Governor, were now filled with creatures who defied description, but were CLEARLY not human. Even stranger, they all wore Diamondback hats, and any that were humanoid enough to have a torso, 2 arms, and a head were sporting the same jersey - West.  


The cloaked figure was approached by the umpires, one of whom kicked the mound in frustration. That same bony hand grabbed the robes at around neck-height, yanked them off and threw them into the sky, where they vanished. A skeletal visage stared back at the umpires, the familiar hair, beard, and the jersey confirming the identity of the new arrival - as if anyone didn't know this was West already, the cheers exploding from the stands, and the jersey on his own back confirmed it.   


The Starting Pitcher is here. Let's play some fuckin' baseball."

MIA 1B [BEST Nova](/u/Schauera30): 0-0

The upcoming batter's name being announced over the PA system was something that Alexander had been waiting all day for. The pressure of gods piercing the veil to leer at this moment threatened to tear at his mind, but he had known they would come. He had not come to baseball originally out of anything more than boredom, a chance to find a hobby unrelated to infernal magicka and eldritch rites. 

His surprise at a weak godhood having formed over the hypothetical confluence of something considered to be ""True"" made him dive wholeheartedly into the sport. The chance to study such an esoteric and limited divinity could have given him insight into the very nature of the divine.

An opposite handed TTO hitter-pitcher matchup, in a park juiced to maximize the long ball for the season. A more perfect Altar to the gods of the Three True Outcomes could not have been designed, a more perfect moment could not have been written to draw the eyes of the divine.

All according to plan.

As BEST Nova moved from the on-deck circle to the batter's box, the PA system operator flicked a switch next to his microphone that had been installed that very morning, with explicit instructions on when it was to be touched etched in a rough, scrawling script. That switch glowed a dull orange, as glyphs carved into and around the grounds of The Ralph, designed to receive the gaze of the Three True Outcomes, and allow Him to stare back.

West came here to study the nature of an esoteric god, and witnessed the birth of a god first-hand. 

Lord Scoville became a Deity to Jis team, and to the league, by the will of the fates, and in His actions a disbeliever witnessed the miraculous, and became the Pontifex Maximus, and vessel of his will. Witnessing his works allowed West to comprehend the unknowable, and bridge the gap between the Material and Immaterial.

These gods would bear witness to something befitting their interests, without the consent of the divine being that already dwelled here."

Dart Ragusa is officially playing in an even numbered season, and has gone more than one season without retiring.  Some said it couldn't be done.  Some said it shouldn't be done.  The -dort was sacred, but has it been broken?  How will this effect MLR, the country, the world?  Is Ragusa's return the reason for the COVID outbreak?  Was China trying to prevent this very moment?  If so, why?  Are they secretly playing the hero?  


Well, I mean, this is China we're talking about, so probably not.  So that means Dart not retiring must be a good thing right?  Not only does China fear it, but the United States Air Force laid the ground work for Dart's return and subversion of expectations.  Yes, he's the key.  Dart Ragusa playing a game on the internet where all he does is attempt (and usually fail) to guess numbers is the key to defeating the Chinese menace!  -dort was a communist conspiracy!  


Or none of this means anything, and Dart's just gonna ground out here again.  


Either way, one thing doesn't change.  


You always swing 31."

Honorable mentions: Ungodly Hour (song), XS, Life’s Too Short by Tinashe (released late enough into 2019 to be considered a 2020 song for me.) and Freaky Girls by Meg."

12155,2020-12-27 09:13:59,kl0bpg,"If I had to pick 10 favorites (these aren't in order because I just cannot do that lol): 


Birthday Suit by Kesha 



XS by Rina Sawayama 



Criminal by Taemin 



5 Star by CL 



Cardigan by Taylor Swift (I haven't listened to any of the rest of Folklore or Evermore but holy fuck, do I love this song) 



Positions by Ariana Grande (honestly, the rest of the album didn't really connect with me but I love this and 34+35 to death) 



Hell In Heaven by Twice ( picking just one song off of their album is incredibly difficult) 



911 by Lady Gaga 



Animals by Architects  



Pirouette by Chiiild 



Honorable mentions to: 'Faith' by The Weeknd, 'Jazz Bar' by Dreamcatcher, 'OMG What's Happening' by Ava Max, 'Crazy Over You' by Blackpink, 'Alanis' Interlude' by Halsey and Alanis Morissette, 'Vices' by Mothica, 'Say The Name' by clipping, ' Breathe Deeper' by Tame Impala, and 'Open (Passionate)' by Kehlani. And like half the songs off of Eyes Wide Open by Twice, specifically 'Bring It Back' and 'I Can't Stop Me'."

Sean Magee/Abbey Road Studios really knocked this one out of the park, the records sound fantastic. Better than I could’ve hoped for! This was no small feat, I think these were fairly challenging sides to cut due to the wide variety of source material and the overall length of the sides. It’s tough to get sides like that down on wax without squashing the music, but on the contrary, [Sean really let the music shine and presented it at its best.](https://i.imgur.com/6eo5csD.jpg) You might even forget that these are just demos!

 



Oh, by the way… did I mention?
 

[There’ll be a special infinitely looping locked-groove at the end of each side. Surprise!](https://i.imgur.com/V6yqScH.mp4)

The big news - the Aural Pleasure Records release of “**Demos Vol. 1 + 2**” is set to be mastered by the legendary **Abbey Road Studios**! Though these songs may be mere sketches, we strongly felt they still deserved to be presented on wax at their best. Abbey Road’s highly demanded team of engineers and world-class mastering chain - the same that have been responsible for critically acclaimed records by *The Rolling Stones* and *The Beatles* - are sure to make the absolute most of the available source material, so you will be able to hear the boys bend genres and forge new paths in music like never before. And with 28 tracks across 2 LPs, this is a collection you will definitely want to return to repeatedly.  

 
 
To top it all off, our version of this collection will be pressed on heavyweight 180gm vinyl, available in 2 unique color variants and packaged in a special jacket with exclusive artwork and poly-lined inner sleeves!

 


* Variant 1 - “**Pie Slices**” tri-color LPs, /400
 

  Rhubarb, huckleberry, key lime, pumpkin, chicken pot pie, and shepherds pie.... just to name some of the flavors, which will prove to be as wonderfully varied as the music pressed into these tasty looking slabs. Tune in, turn on, dig in.

 
 
* Variant 2 - “**Variant To Kill Bad People To**” and “**Variant To Eat Bananas To**” striped tri-color LPs with 2 color splatter, /100

 


  Directly inspired by the band’s creative subtitles for each volume in this collection, this ultra-limited color variant will be randomly inserted into some lucky orders!

 


* As a bonus, an incredibly limited 4 sets of **test pressings** will be made available for sale… and purchasing one will allow you to leave your permanent mark on these records! The 4 buyers of the test pressings will be able to provide a short phrase or message to be inscribed in the runout groove and pressed into every final copy of these records, forever etched in vinyl for all to see. Shout out a friend, share your favorite King Gizzard reference, or just get weird with it - the choice is yours! This will prove to be a very unique opportunity for fans to be a part of the final records, so these test pressings are not expected to last long on the shop!


 

 

Pre-orders will go live on **www.auralpleasurerecords.com** at **12PM EST** on **Saturday, January 23rd**. Please follow **@AuralPleasureRecords** on Instagram for further updates! 

 
 

Aural Pleasure Records’ commitment to quality is stronger than ever, and the difference will be clear - this pressing of “**Demos Vol. 1 + 2**” will be a must-have for any fan, and a welcoming entry point for anybody new to the Gizzverse. We hope you enjoy."

12199,2021-02-21 20:11:05,kk7brf,"Hey everyone! Dave from Aural Pleasure Records here again. Quick update about “Demos Vol. 1 + 2” - Figured I’d give everyone a heads up, in case you haven’t seen it… [I’ve been running a giveaway for a set of test pressings over on Instagram!](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKwd-XSMq80/) 

 
Test pressings are an important part of the process of pressing vinyl. They are typically made in incredibly small quantities - only a small handful of copies, which are intended for examining the records to check for any potential issues before approving the start of the actual pressing run. It’s the first point in the process at which you can actually hear the record after it’s been cut, so it’s especially important to verify that everything went according to plan in the mastering and plating stages!
 

This is a great chance to add something incredibly rare to your collection, so you definitely won’t want to miss out on this. And sharing the details of this release will *really* help give the pre-orders a much needed final push.
  
Even if you don’t want to enter, please still find a way let all the music lovers in your life know about my release of this demo collection if you can. It’s a great introduction for anyone new to the Gizzverse. Longtime fans will love it even more. It’s being mastered at Abbey Road. And it’ll be available in 2 really rad color variants. There’s a lot to like here! Word of mouth really helps and every little bit counts, so I definitely appreciate everyone who does their part to get the word out there :) thanks again everyone!"

To address the ""Gizz's fair share"" argument on my end, I'm not really making any money on mine and fully intend to go in the hole a bit to send Gizz 5 or 10 copies if either of mine get made. Not trying to make anything off of these, just made some cool art that went well with them and would love to see them get made.

There's 200 up for pre-order anyway, with 30 going to Gizz. Then whenever we know how much we get, the rest will go on sale.

Pre-orders go in a prize draw for a test pressing too.

Limited to 300 numbered copies from one vendor in the UK. Price £19.99 + P&P. Doesn't mention if they've used the better WAVs for those four songs or not, but here's the blurb on the listing:

&#x200B;

King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard- Teenage Gizzard

Cat.no: SFR001

12” LP picture disc record.

Includes  2 sticker sheets with your favourite band and logos. ( 1 sticker sheet  to use freely and another to keep with your record because if you’re  anything like me you want to keep your precious records intact! )

Also a 12” fine art print on textured fresco gesso 300gsm paper.

The cover is double sided Matt laminated for extra protection and splash proof.

The  inside artwork has the lyrics included. The cover has been designed so  if either of the front flaps are open the artwork matches the inside  seamlessly.

These are hand numbered/300. They will be sent out in number order so the sooner you order the lower the number.

This  is a family project by Gizzheads for Gizzheads. We have taken a lot of  care and put lots of effort into making this a beautiful record.

Released on my new label Shizz Free Records. I am also hoping to release a few more records soon so keep an eye open.

I  am in the process of obtaining an official barcode for this release as I  have had one record store confirmed that they want to stock this and  maybe more. I will add the barcode number when I get it.

Please  note this is a pre-order which will ship late March/ early April at the  latest. I have already got the covers, sticker sheets and art prints and  I’m just waiting for the records being pressed.

I have 100% positive feedback so if you have any questions please just ask.

I  do not use click and collect so if you select this service I will  cancel the order unless you can provide an alternative address. I  will send this on a next day delivery if you pay by 1pm( UK ).  International buyers will be shipped using eBay global shipping  services. All my records are packed superbly. I am a record collector and send them as I would like to  receive them.

I know that SB changed the Adelaide pressing from 2 to 3LPs on account of the length of that concert...but hadn't realised the London should be a triple as well. Explains why some labels have done this. I haven't pre-ordered this one, but did want it. Hopefully SB will spot this and change to a triple as well. The price difference between a 2LP or 3Lp is only a couple of quid."

12536,2021-01-06 02:37:25,kk7brf,"Hey,

Thanks for reaching out. I appreciate the support. When I set out to do the project my plan was to only do 100. Unfortunately, to get everything I wanted like the double LP (still left off some stuff I would have liked), gatefold, the clear wax, heavyweight vinyl, remastering, and test presses to ensure quality, I had to do 300 to be in the green (or charge >$50). I just didn't think it would be worth doing otherwise. Qrates won't let you do a crowdfunding campaign that loses money or may have done it at a loss so I could have a copy and put something cool out into the world. We're still getting around 6 purchases a day which is great but probably won't get us across the finish line. I've been restraining myself from spamming the sub to advertise. It's a possibility that I'll just buy the rest to sell on bandcamp, ebay, discogs, Amazon, etc. Depends on how many are left."
12537,2021-01-14 16:25:12,kk7brf,thanks. It was tough narrowing them down! Spent the last two weeks listening to nothing but live Gizz tracks. Which isn't a bad thing ;-)

Paris and Brussels, come with tote bags"
12544,2020-12-26 03:20:55,kk7brf,"Really nice of you to put this together, thanks! Love this sub"
12545,2020-12-27 08:19:25,kk7brf,"I work at Fuzz Club. We are in the brainstorming phase so can't provide many details at the moment, but it will be in the same vain as our Polygonwanaland version. 

Feel free to add to the spreadsheet that there will be 500 copies of each (that might change) and there will be a box set with the two demo records. 

I'll come back with more details asap."
12546,2020-12-27 04:40:28,kk7brf,Yes I would also love the confirmation of that
12547,2021-01-07 22:04:00,kk7brf,Currently working on the artworks and trying to improve the sound quality. Making good progress! Will announce details next week hopefully.
12548,2021-03-15 11:14:06,kk7brf,"If I'm honest, it's unlikely that there will be individual 7"" for the London release, the extras with the initial release were as a result of positive tolerance with the plant. To guarantee one you would need to order the package"
12549,2020-12-26 01:48:48,kk7brf,"Yeah, I suppose I should, it's honestly kind of weird that it's not more prominently listed on the pages. (Heavyweight vinyl will be listed as ""Special heavy vinyl"" vs. just ""Special vinyl"" or whatever)"

12551,2020-12-29 00:41:38,kk7brf,Cheers
12552,2021-01-05 17:52:00,kk7brf,Awesome to hear! Pumped for that box set - I was about to reach out about the file discrepancy good to know they'll press the best quality!
12553,2021-03-07 17:48:55,kk7brf,"Thanks, I really appreciate it! It’ll be such a neat little record if it gets made"
12554,2021-03-07 23:47:48,kk7brf,Thanks! I'm glad so many people are pumped so far :D
12555,2021-01-11 14:54:14,kk7brf,All lives are doubles and apparently Adelaide is 3x

12562,2020-12-26 19:23:05,kk7brf,Thanks!
12563,2020-12-27 01:43:22,kk7brf,Thanks!
12564,2020-12-27 20:30:24,kk7brf,I think Paris and London sound the best. Followed by Asheville. Agree entirely about Adelaide.
12565,2020-12-29 21:05:41,kk7brf,It's nuts! I got my Poly for 1 Euro! Had to pay shipping to the US but it was only like 10 bucks.
12566,2020-12-29 21:41:25,kk7brf,Ohhh that's a bummer. It's definitely too long for a single side. They might not include that on the pressing to keep it a triple LP set..
12567,2021-01-04 17:16:59,kk7brf,Thanks! 🤞🤞
12568,2021-01-07 03:12:28,kk7brf,"@buttongrass, what's happened to the bootleg megathread? I can't find it anymore."
12569,2021-01-08 01:13:15,kk7brf,Added.
12570,2021-01-15 19:23:23,kk7brf,Not long now!
12571,2021-01-13 21:13:25,kk7brf,"Only 34 left now,...wow..that's really taking off. So many of these qrates pressings aren't gunna be pressed..so nice to see somebody doing alright....would it be the very cheap price that's drawing folks?

Speaking of which...is it just me, or is Rough Trade taking the water here with their pressings at £30 a pop and a boxset containing three albums for a ton? With no royalties to pay...c'mon...that's too much. Stolen body did their boxset for £71..and that has all of them!"
12572,2021-01-14 19:24:51,kk7brf,🙏🙏🤞🤞
12573,2021-01-25 12:52:22,kk7brf,Thanks! We're so close!
12574,2021-01-27 03:31:58,kk7brf,🤠
12575,2020-12-27 00:52:41,kk7brf,THANK YOU! :))
12576,2021-01-08 11:28:38,kk7brf,Thank you!
12577,2020-12-26 00:05:40,kk7brf,Thanks man! It’s really awesome of you to set up this thread!
12578,2020-12-26 04:14:31,kk7brf,"Thanks mate, sorry I was wondering about the actual vinyl pressing plants. Can't help but cook up a couple of ideas, need to look at costs before jumping in too deep"
12579,2020-12-27 21:07:31,kk7brf,Thank you so much! 15 additional copies will go towards Gizz.
12580,2020-12-28 01:01:14,kk7brf,"im ordering 25 of the glow in the dark cassettes, 15 will be put up for preorder on the broadsound bandcamp and the other 10 will be sent to gizz to do whatever they want with them"
12581,2020-12-28 23:35:38,kk7brf,"Yes I do provide the artwork as I did for their previous sold out release of Polygondwaland. Very cool label, quality products, serious dudes."
12582,2021-01-01 20:05:00,kk7brf,"I removed
Link ain't public yet, is verifying
Will post when ready"
12583,2021-01-01 20:59:48,kk7brf,"That’s what I figured regarding the qrates, it’s too many"
12584,2021-01-03 22:42:18,kk7brf,Wait really? Oh damn I’m boutta go buy some more holy shit
12585,2021-01-09 20:00:51,kk7brf,Described tomorrow’s release as ‘the first LP of a series released throughout 2021’ so we’ll find out what’s what in the morning!
12586,2021-01-10 14:05:10,kk7brf,Looks like it'll be the Live In London bootleg..
12587,2021-01-10 11:04:08,kk7brf,Easy cop. Got a few of their pressings in my collection already and they’re always top class so more than happy to grab all the bootlegs from them!
12588,2021-01-10 17:22:24,kk7brf,"Looks like the Kale & Banana Smoothie repress of Float Along, nice. But really interested in a zoetrope TG version, should one appear. Not heard Blood Records before, how good are they rep wise?"
12589,2021-01-11 00:34:10,kk7brf,Added thanks
12590,2021-01-28 19:32:11,kk7brf,"I bought a box as I'm compiling various releases from Stolen Body, Diggers, Exag, Blood Records and waiting on Fuzz Club live London. Need something to put them all in..."
12591,2021-03-30 20:16:41,kk7brf,"Thanks.  I can do this with Audacity for each individual track, but is there any easier way to do it for the whole album?"
12592,2021-01-14 02:15:25,kk7brf,"I'm not op, but the gator on the cover was designed by /u/Bmangoz (@gizzfamilymemes on Instagram), an awesome member of the community who creates tons of Gizz fan art and donates all proceeds to charity. Rough Trade somehow came across his artwork and decided to use it on the cover of the box set, without any communication or permission"
12593,2021-01-14 16:04:00,kk7brf,"i'm not involved at all, just saw they listed them :)"
12594,2021-01-13 23:36:22,kk7brf,Thanks added
12595,2021-05-30 22:11:11,kk7brf,Thanks added
12596,2021-01-04 17:50:33,kk7brf,"I assumed it was probably too many at 400 to press. It’s my first time attempting this sort of diy crowdfunding, so I think I definitely overshot the demand for a 10”."
12597,2020-12-28 11:51:40,kk7brf,"haha dude that would be so sick, that's like a feature album with king gizz"
12598,2021-03-29 21:54:05,kk7brf,Awesome thanks - added.

12600,2021-01-02 21:31:44,kk7brf,"I hope it makes it’s goal, it’s only one that has seriously caught my eye."
12601,2020-12-31 00:37:08,kk7brf,"Yeah, the whole package had me. This is the kind of creativity I like to support.


I also just listen to the song selections and it works so well with the theme. This will be perfect for Sunday mornings with my wife and kids. 


Best of luck in getting funded!"
12602,2021-01-06 03:58:16,kk7brf,"Well there's an idea! I do sometimes buy more than one copy, especially it it's an overseas vendor, as it sometimes works out cheaper to order more to spread the shipping costs/import costs.  So maybe if you're down to a handful of copies of reaching the goal......i might (I says reservedly!) buy the rest! However, by my maths, 6 x 22 days is 132 + 114 = 246. I couldn't stretch to 50+ copies! lol!

Hopefully it'll succeed, but if it doesn't, you could try again on diggers perhaps?"
12603,2021-01-14 19:17:44,kk7brf,"Is this the same Bubblewrap label based in Cardiff...that did the black & red Poly a few years ago?

&#x200B;

Edit: scratch that..it is. Cool."
12604,2020-12-28 00:25:47,kk7brf,"There will definitely be more, personally I’ve got no issue with eco wax but it’s a fair point!"
12605,2021-01-22 16:31:53,kk7brf,"Excellent news, thank you :)"
12606,2021-01-25 12:51:39,kk7brf,Added
12607,2021-01-25 14:04:44,kk7brf,"And there I was, hammering the refresh button.. By the way, I noticed your site isn't secured with SSL/TLS. This might put people off from ordering.."
12608,2021-01-23 00:18:30,kk7brf,Looking forward to seeing this one...i got one of the Tetracromancy edtions of Poly a few years ago....sounds great.
12609,2021-03-30 20:10:40,kk7brf,those look great too
12610,2020-12-27 18:16:22,kk7brf,Can you mention the issues with the Teenage Gizz files?  There are better quality files than the ones uploaded by Gizz
12611,2020-12-27 11:20:33,kk7brf,Ditto...
12612,2021-03-15 22:18:39,kk7brf,"all good, decided to preorder as the pressing looks too good to pass up!"
12613,2020-12-26 21:42:31,kk7brf,[removed]
12614,2021-01-01 18:56:26,kk7brf,"all good, i really really appreciate you organizing these bootlegs all in one place!! 

i just made another lol, if you could add it when you have the time that would be great :)) http://qrates.com/projects/22427-the-unreleased"
12615,2020-12-25 23:54:59,kk7brf,Awesome! PM me when you've got it in a form you're happy to share and I'll include it :)
12616,2020-12-26 01:47:52,kk7brf,"Looks pretty wild yeah, haha, I'm going for a fairly understated vibe to match the album art though.

I left my own comment for the main megathread but I don't know if you'd want to include that both of my Qrates pressings are on heavyweight vinyl. I know that's more work for you but I have actually noticed most of the Qrates pressings aren't heavyweight.

Either way, thanks for making the list and for including mine!"
12617,2021-03-25 23:56:01,kk7brf,The purpose of this thread isn't to track the Poly releases given there is already an existing mega for that (albeit outdated): [https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/7d28ww/polygondwanaland\_megathread/](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/7d28ww/polygondwanaland_megathread/)
12618,2020-12-29 21:11:16,kk7brf,Yeah i remember that one.....unbelievable! Digger's must surely be losing money.... the base vinyl itself must cost a coupla quid?! lol!
12619,2020-12-29 21:52:05,kk7brf,I reached out to them! Hoping to hear back
12620,2021-01-07 03:21:11,kk7brf,"No idea mate, will follow it up with the mods.  
Edit: Fixed!"
12621,2021-01-13 21:23:05,kk7brf,"Yeah man the Rough Trade box set is far too expensive. No mention of sending any to the band either as far as I know. Also, i saw in another thread that the artwork has been stolen from another artist which is really shitty. Rough Trade could probably do it for cheaper than stolen body if they wanted to, all about profit. Bit of a shame, i'm usually first to jump on a Rough Trade exclusive"
12622,2021-01-26 06:27:56,kk7brf,"Ahhh...now then........that's changed things hasn't it?  Okay then...i shall fulfill me promise, i've chipped in for 2 copies...now only 20 copies to go to hit the target! 3 days left folks!"
12623,2021-01-27 03:42:08,kk7brf,"I was just thinking....what if it stopped at 299?! Surely even qrates wouldn't cancel the project for being one short, would they??!!

Curious to know who put in that large order for 80 copies or so yesterday...you?"
12624,2020-12-26 06:17:39,kk7brf,"Ah I see, that's a very different question. Check this out https://www.hyperviolet.co/blog/australias-making-pressing-vinyl-easier-than-ever"
12625,2021-01-10 08:54:14,kk7brf,"Blood Records do a lot of original zoetrope releases Biffy Clyro, Fat White Family. Warmduscher, Magic Gang to name a few, so it's possible they'll do say a Teenage Gizz zoetrope...."
12626,2021-01-10 12:35:55,kk7brf,Blood Recs responded on their Instagram there will be a zoetrope but which one nyk.
12627,2021-01-10 20:22:51,kk7brf,"I've a few of their releases Biffy Clyro, The Cribs. Good original pressings. Their zoetrope vinyls are  very good."
12628,2021-02-11 23:05:40,kk7brf,"I’m doing the same. Mainly for the live in London that I’m trying to collect since I have been tontura gig and travelled from Portugal only for that. 

Any idea about for how many record’s is the box?

Thanks"
12629,2021-03-30 20:22:36,kk7brf,"Do *not* use audacity, for any purposes. It will happily mangle the ever living fuck out of your audio. Very easy to test this, put in a silent wav, digital black. Do nothing to it, now hit save. Inspect again. Not so black anymore! For simple format conversion it’s pretty unnecessary to use a full fledged DAW anyway, you can use the FLAC CLI if you’re comfortable with that, or there are any number of programs with graphical interfaces that can simplify the process. I often use Foobar2000 just because I have a number of custom presets I can load up very quickly, and is easier to use for batch processes, I also have a somewhat ancient one pinned to my taskbar called “FlicFlac” thats very lightweight and easy to call up quickly for simple conversions"
12630,2021-01-14 02:34:32,kk7brf,"Thanks for the kind words and heads up /u/wordskis :)
Yeah I designed this stealie, and I wasn't contacted or involved with anything concerning this boxset."
12631,2021-01-16 12:23:31,kk7brf,"looks like these individual releases are also available at other UK indie stores (just the boxset exclusive to RT)

[https://www.resident-music.com/productdetails&path=77&product\_id=75155](https://www.resident-music.com/productdetails&path=77&product_id=75155)"
12632,2021-01-04 18:19:46,kk7brf,"Yeah maybe. It seems that most of the Qrates projects aren't being met though. Even some that have a lower count to meet. For me, I was lucky enough to get a Stolen Body box set so I'm not likely to get anything else unless its something really special. There just aren't enough people I think, plus money is tight these days. Not everyone can afford to records."
12633,2021-01-04 23:10:53,kk7brf,"Yeah you’ve well overshot with 400, put it at 100 and cheaper and I’d back it - even the Rats Live which seemed to throw people into a frenzy is just over 100"
12634,2020-12-30 22:10:19,kk7brf,Right? I’m definitely doing it!
12635,2020-12-25 23:12:22,kk7brf,"But that 100 is reserved for customers that back your pressing, no?"
12636,2021-01-03 01:02:11,kk7brf,"I'm not au fait with this Qrates platform...do these need to be fully funded to go to press, or is it a percentage based...say 50% funded to be successful, for example?"
12637,2020-12-31 00:53:44,kk7brf,Exactly what we were going for! My kids have been bopping to it all week
12638,2021-01-06 04:03:24,kk7brf,Maybe so! I think we'll get it to come to fruition one way or another. Thanks again!
12639,2021-01-14 20:30:29,kk7brf,Yeah it is! well stoked to be doing another one
12640,2021-01-25 15:05:44,kk7brf,Thanks a ton bud :)
12641,2021-01-25 15:04:48,kk7brf,"I appreciate the heads up! That did also come up when talking with my webhost, so that’s something we’re gonna get squared away ASAP :) On the plus side at least all payment data is 100% securely handled through PayPal so for the meantime there should be no worries there"
12642,2021-01-23 01:43:08,kk7brf,"Ahhh, thanks for the kind words bud! Glad to hear you lucked out with that variant hahah"

12646,2020-12-29 21:42:17,kk7brf,Yeah it's shocking. I think they do these Gizz bootlegs for no profit. Legit just to cover the costs of pressing the vinyl and then buyer pays shipping.
12647,2021-01-04 03:16:32,kk7brf,Any response from them about the Head On/Pill?
12648,2021-01-07 07:30:22,kk7brf,"Nice one! Did you find out why the mods booted the bootleg thread?!

BTW, when you update your list, the other Nomad Eel clear gitd vinyl with splatter edition, was limited to 75 copies. Can't remember what the price was. Can't find any details on that Wax Mage bundle though, but i suspect it's less than 25 copies."
12649,2021-01-26 11:45:44,kk7brf,Thanks! So close!
12650,2021-01-27 03:44:28,kk7brf,I'm not sure... it's probably all automation. Our odds are looking good though
12651,2020-12-26 06:44:57,kk7brf,thanks! really appreciate it
12652,2021-01-11 13:04:57,kk7brf,Cool. I see they are doing one then..hope to snag one.
12653,2021-02-12 08:41:55,kk7brf,"Sorry no I assume it'll fit a copy each of Stolen Body records bootlegs. Funnily enough my bootleg collection I'll be taking over to my place in Portugal, once I'm allowed to."
12654,2021-03-31 02:08:20,kk7brf,"Huh I didn't know you could do that with foobar2000, I'll have to look into it.

I use audacity all the time for editing a podcast and it works fine except for the part where it makes 10 min of audio into nearly a gig of file space."
12655,2021-01-14 04:52:22,kk7brf,That's very dissapointing. I've added that fact to the note section
12656,2021-01-23 13:07:14,kk7brf,They seem to have switched out the artwork. Did you get in contact with them? Your artwork looked dope btw.
12657,2021-01-04 23:29:24,kk7brf,"I was going to get that stolen Body boxset as it was so cheap but decided on just getting their  teen gizzard and demo's albums. I've just purchased the Exags live in Brussels album (Belgium/3d lenticular/good cause?) and looking at hopefully a Fuzz Club live in London release.
Stolen Body have said they will also be selling empty box sets so that'll be great for my purchases..."
12658,2021-01-04 18:24:56,kk7brf,"Makes total sense at money being tight. But I’m not going to give up on my project. Probably will sit on it for a bit, but try again another time"

12665,2021-01-04 03:23:50,kk7brf,"They responded and said they’re not sure if they will press Head On yet (because of the length), so they listed it as a digital download. They mentioned they will wait to see what their engineer suggests"

12670,2021-03-31 04:40:41,kk7brf,"It’s definitely simple to use, and free, but it does have some unfortunate bugs so I can’t recommend it for any purpose. I don’t even have a technical description for what it is injecting into the audio due to how little sense it makes. Cant imagine what would cause 10 minutes of audio to get so inflated either - even uncompressed 24/192 WAV shouldn’t be that big hahah. Thankfully I’ve never encountered that particular issue. 
 
 
If you have access to the Adobe creative suite for other works, I’d look into using Audition. Doesn’t seem to get much love in the pro world but it’s really not bad, and some people have access to the software and never even take advantage of it. It’s built off of a much older piece of software called Cool Edit Pro that’s been around since the 90’s (before Adobe bought it anyway) Even I have a ~20 year old version of it that still runs well in modern windows and is still really excellent and quick to use for most simple DAW tasks. It’s ancient software but works well, I would recommend CEP over audacity in a heartbeat if you could get access to an installer and a license key, which are definitely out there…"
12671,2021-01-23 14:53:31,kk7brf,Yeah the artist that the record company hired just stole it :D. RT was super helpful and got it fixed by contacting the rec comp in the UK. Also thanks!
12672,2021-01-13 10:29:17,kk7brf,"The Exag Records version will actually be a 3LP version. Should be announced soon, early pre-order will keep it at the paid price while the following orders will be slightly more expensive. The whole packaging will be very, very fancy."
12673,2021-01-04 18:26:11,kk7brf,Right on! I hope you're able to get it funded or try again if it does not.
12674,2020-12-25 23:21:27,kk7brf,"Yeah so my question is, how do you go about giving the band their share? Will you pump the money made by the 100 back into Qrates to get it up to 200 and then give the band what’s owed? 

(I’m trying my best not to sound like a cunt I promise, I’m just curious as I’ve never used or bought anything from Qrates before)"
12675,2021-01-23 12:37:33,kk7brf,"The unfortunate thing is that those 4 special orders are the only ones from the original campaign that have yet to be fulfilled. I absolutely hate how long it’s taken and what a nightmare they have been to produce, something I will definitely keep in mind in the future before dreaming up any wacky novelty variants like this. I’ll stick to what I know from now on and just make “normal” records! However it is still the plan to do everything possible to make those 4 copies happen, and there will definitely be a significant extra value added to that reward once they go out - hopefully it will be agreed that the wait will have been worthwhile!"

12677,2021-01-04 03:25:28,kk7brf,Cool.Needle juice has it split between 2 sides.
12678,2021-01-27 15:55:38,kk7brf,🍾We did it! You can still pre-order at the link above
12679,2021-03-31 20:01:48,kk7brf,I'll look into the adobe stuff but I was exaggerating a little: 90 minutes of audio can make anywhere between 3 and 9 gigs
12680,2021-01-23 15:24:39,kk7brf,Haha proper bootlegging. Glad you got it sorted out with them. No worries.
12681,2021-01-13 16:54:24,kk7brf,Is that right? Glad I got the early pre order in. The 3D cover looks really good.

12683,2020-12-25 23:38:21,kk7brf,"This guy has a head screwed on!! They just tweeted out that you guys need to send them some to sell, whatever they think is fair for profiting off of them. I’ve been saying this all day!"
12684,2020-12-26 21:29:58,kk7brf,"As someone who is looking to put together a few QRATEs pressings, hopefully share them early next week, you can buy records from your own pressing using the sellers dashboard. So I plan to buy them and send them right to the band.

We also plan to use this as a way to raise money for charity."
12685,2021-01-24 04:29:23,kk7brf,Crikey...but it's been 3+ years since that campaign began! I amazed the buyers haven't cancelled!  However i do recall you reporting some problems with those ones at the time.....had no idea it is still going on tho! Hope you finally resolve it soon. The mock ups did look cool.
12686,2020-12-26 21:53:12,kk7brf,[removed]
12687,2021-01-27 16:07:22,kk7brf,"Yay! Yeah i just seen...bang on 300 and 30 odd hours left to go...so you pick up a few more. Good job to whoever it was that snapped those 80 copies!   

On a more serious note....having zero experience with Qrates, i'd never heard of them til this bootleg thing started...do you know how long it takes for these to made and sent out...2-3 months?"
12688,2021-03-31 20:19:52,kk7brf,"That does sound about right for audio recorded at a higher bit depth/sampling rate. It should be a consistent filesize due to the constant bitrate, 90 minutes of uncompressed 24/192 WAV or AIFF would weigh in at about 6GB. But once you can get a batch conversion going in Foobar2K, a -8 FLAC will be very fast to encode, perfect for archival purposes, and should drop the filesize considerably. Wouldn’t be surprised if you got back several GB of disk space afterwards per 90 minute file, not sure how many you have but it’ll definitely add up!"
12689,2020-12-25 23:35:26,kk7brf,"Ah cool! I hope others using the service follow suit, would hate for their to be any drama as a result of it as it’s such a cool idea haha."
12690,2021-01-24 09:51:49,kk7brf,"It is a messed up situation and I shoulder 100% of the blame. There were initially 5 sold, however one did cancel when refunds were still able to be processed. I do my best to be 100% transparent though and I will do everything I can to make things right to the 4 remaining backers, to everyone’s satisfaction. We did have a version that could have gone out earlier but it was found that it could have been hazardous if unknowingly mishandled by someone not familiar with the oddity of that record and I just didn’t feel right sending something like that out. So things were reconfigured from that point and new manufacturing partners were found who were more familiar with creating novelties like this."

12692,2021-01-27 16:08:43,kk7brf,They are experiencing delays due to Covid but anticipate May
12693,2020-12-26 07:27:26,kk7brf,"this is seriously such a cool idea. i haven’t even listened to them outside of those live performances that blew up on youtube, but i’m gonna jump in on a cassette."

12708,2020-12-25 17:32:35,kk1dat,How would you rank a fully fit Gibson vs dobbins (and Jacobs) this week?
12709,2020-12-25 22:19:31,kk1dat,"Have Ahmed, Moss, Singletary, and Ito smith for 2 spots in the chip, full PPR. Leaning towards Ahmed and either Moss or Singletary, anyone have any opinions? Also could start Mike Williams or Perriman, since one of the spots is a flex."
12710,2020-12-26 02:03:05,kk1dat,Trying to decide between Hurts and Brady for the championship. I feel like it’s really close.
12711,2020-12-25 17:48:50,kk1dat,"This please. I have Dobbins, Taylor and Jacobs. Currently I’m playing Taylor. My opponent has three players going today and Saturday, so my current plan is to see how they perform. If they over perform, I’m playing Dobbins. Under, Jacobs."
12712,2020-12-25 19:58:55,kk1dat,"I would rank them Jacobs, Dobbins, then Gibson unless we knew for sure that checkdown Alex Smith was starting, but we may not know that until game-time (late afternoon Sunday), and by then Jacobs and Dobbins will have already played. If we knew ahead of time that Gibson was 100% (which he probably won't be), and that Smith was starting, I would move Gibson ahead of Dobbins, but as it stands now he would be the odd man out if you're starting 2 of them."
12713,2020-12-25 18:18:05,kk1dat,I also have those three guys and have no idea who to play.  Jacobs is probably the safest bet I guess.
12714,2020-12-25 20:00:00,kk1dat,I would order them Taylor/Jacobs/Dobbins this week.
12715,2020-12-25 21:11:08,kk1dat,"Cheers, that was my thinking too."
12716,2020-12-26 01:31:45,kk1dat,I went against Kamara so it doesn’t matter lol
