0,2020-02-04 19:45:10,eyvrk8,"Ladies and Gentlemen, the state of my onion is upsetting. It is sliced in half sitting on the counter in my kitchen and everyone is crying.

Here's what happened:

I thought I'd host a little cocktail party and invited 15 friends, including my colleague Bernie. It was supposed to last from 6-8. I stocked my wet bar with the essentials and I made a pretty nice spread of appetizers. I had my redneck sushi...those roll ups of ham, creamed cheese and pickle, a crock pot with meatballs and sauce, an ample veggie platter with dips, a cheese and crackers tray, some lemon tarts... you know, just an assortment of finger foods.

Well, around 6:30 Bernie showed up in a minivan. He had ten uninvited guests with him. They marched in as he announced, ""I have brought some people with me and most of them are not citizens. I told them that America is nice and welcoming to everyone so let's show them a good time!""

I was a little taken aback, but I figured that for an hour and a half, we could handle the extra guests.

Bernie grabbed the remote off the coffee table and turned on my teevee. I'd had some nice music planned, but Bernie said, ""You gotta watch that MSNBC. Those people know what is happening. You cannot simply listen to music when the allagawks are hoarding all the wealth. It is up to all of us to educate ourselves about how we ah bein' taken advantage of by da rich!""

Being a good hostess and slightly frightened, I acquiesced. For the next hour Bernie and his bus friends watched MSNBC and discussed Marxist theory in the front room. I heard one young man exclaim, ""That Chris Hayes is just SO sexy! I would do him until next Thursday!""

They occasionally left to grab snacks and booze and one of them expressed disgust at the ""wastefulness of my single-use paper plates.""

I mingled mostly with my invited guests since even an appearance in the living room to offer up a drink or appetizer was met with somewhat hostile glances. At one point a girl with a Che shirt said, ""That's a nice wedding ring... did you know that the diamond was probably mined by a starving child living in slave conditions?"" As I backed out of the room a broccoli floret flew over my head and hit the wall as Bernie bellowed, ""Sandra, you are a vegan and I'm pretty sure that these vegetable dips contain dairy!""

At 7:45 I was looking forward to the end of this nightmare, but Bernie approached me. He said, ""I found myself taking a look in the hall closet and I found this heah bottle of Veve Clicket champagne. I heard it's good stuff!""

""I I I am saving that for Valentine's Day..."" I stuttered.

""You ah actin' like an allagawk. Hoarding all the wealth in your closet. What kind of a good hostess doesn't offer her guests the best stuff...my Medicare for all plan and nationalizing of US industries is meant to prevent just this kind of injustice. You need to open this heah champagne or you are a totalitarian allagawk who hates the workahs!""

*Cork pop*

So it's eight. My invited guests thank me for the interesting cocktail party and leave.

As I turn towards the living room to give the Bernie bus a gentle reminder that the party is over, he's right there... right there in my face. He's ruddy and his hair is sticking up all over. He jabs his finger in my sternum and says, ""You have over-served me. I am in no shape to drive my friends back to the center. There was so little food that we are ALL over the limit and to be honest, it's a big house you got heah, there's room for all of us to just spend the night. Plus, Maddow is on and that gal is pretty conservative, but sometimes she really has something important to say.""

I go to the kitchen to do some clearing up and can overhear the conversation in the living room. It's mostly Bernie talking. As I open the fridge, I hear him yell, ""Don't be putting those snacks away...aftah Maddow I have planned to do a lecture on Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals and that always makes people hungry.""

I ready some beds and grab all of the extra pillows and blankets. At this point I'm actually encouraging booze consumption in the hope that people will just pass out. I smell weed. Too far. I enter the living room and say, ""It's one thing to come to my party and demand to stay, it's another thing to do something illegal that can have the police knocking on my door...""

""Okay boomer..."" says Bernie. The gen x-er in me internally screams as Bernie's guests dissolve into laughter at his very original, clever and totally not hackneyed joke.

Finally, at midnight, they seem to be about to go to sleep. I move my birdcage into the bedroom and lock the door behind me because I heard two of them plotting to release my cockatiel into the freezing winter night because, ""It's immoral to cage a pet like that. Birds belong in nature.""

Silence descends and all is well. The Berniebus is asleep and I look forward to saying goodbye in the morning. I wake at 9 and tiptoe around the bodies to make myself a pot of coffee. I clean the kitchen quietly. At ten AM Bernie shuffles into the kitchen in what appears to be my husband's robe and slippers. ""I hope you don't mind. I appropriated these from the laundry room. I saw that your husband has three robes. If you don't mind...I'd like to take this one home with me on account of I only have one robe. And this one heah is a good robe that I really like.""

I simply sip my coffee in silence. Bernie helps himself to a banana. Then he says:

""Hey, my chums are gonna be hungry when they wake up around noon. Why don't you get some food ready for them?""

I say, ""You came to a cocktail party, ate the food I served and now you want continued feeding? When your chums wake up, you can pile in the Bernie van and go to Denny's.""

""Corporate scum! If we went anywhere we'd go to some local business with ethically-sourced...yadda yadda...but WHAT if I told you that I know how to make a pot of soup using only one stone?""

Well, you know how this story goes. I give Bernie a pot of water and he finds a stone in the back yard. He puts it in the pot exclaiming how great this stone soup is gonna be. Then he starts rooting around in the fridge. ""This hamburger you got heah is gonna make my stone soup so much better! Look heah! Carrots! Those always improve stone soup! Oh, some tomatoes...I'm gonna add those to my soup I'm making using only a stone and...hey, can you maybe slice that onion ovah there? I can't do everything by myself...when I was on the Stalinist kibbutz in Israel, I became an expert in how to make soup with only one stone, but we hafta share the work load, youknowwhatImean?""

So I grab the onion and I slice it in half. The rage of a thousand dead kulaks begins to build in my soul and animus rises hot like a poker. Tears spring to my eyes. From the onion? Maybe...

The next thing I know, I find myself shouting, ""OUT! GET. OUT!""

Bernie suddenly looks like a bewildered old man. ""You shouldn't abuse an elder like this you know...""

So I say, ""Siri, play The Internationale at maximum volume.""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8EMx7Y16Vo

""OUT!"" I scream... walking room to room rousing the Bernie Bros from their sleep. ""Out! Now!"" I say... showing them the door. One named Roderick says, ""Oh no. You used scented detergent on the blanket that I cuddled under last night and now I have hives!""

""OUT!""

As the last one wipes the sleep from her eyes and the group is finally on the front lawn, Bernie says to me, ""Say... can you front me some gas money? The tank here is about empty and all these guys donated their cash to my campaign last night and I can't use campaign funds for personal business.""

I slam the door.

The state of my onion is bad. It's divided and there are tears."
1,2020-02-04 19:45:11,eyvrk8,"Wadies and Gentwemen, the state of my onion is upsetting. It is swiced in hawf sitting on the countew in my kitchen and evewyone is cwying.

Hewe's what happened:

I thought I'd host a wittwe cocktaiw pawty and invited 15 fwiends, incwuding my cowweague Bewnie. It was supposed to wast fwom 6-8. I stocked my wet baw with the essentiaws and I made a pwetty nice spwead of appetizews. I had my wedneck sushi...those woww ups of ham, cweamed cheese and pickwe, a cwock pot with meatbawws and sauce, an ampwe veggie pwattew with dips, a cheese and cwackews tway, some wemon tawts... you know, just an assowtment of fingew foods.

Weww, awound 6:30 Bewnie showed up in a minivan. He had ten uninvited guests with him. They mawched in as he announced, ""I have bwought some peopwe with me and most of them awe not citizens. I towd them that Amewica is nice and wewcoming to evewyone so wet's show them a good time!""

I was a wittwe taken aback, but I figuwed that fow an houw and a hawf, we couwd handwe the extwa guests.

Bewnie gwabbed the wemote off the coffee tabwe and tuwned on my teevee. I'd had some nice music pwanned, but Bewnie said, ""You gotta watch that MSNBC. Those peopwe know what is happening. You cannot simpwy wisten to music when the awwagawks awe hoawding aww the weawth. It is up to aww of us to educate ouwsewves about how we ah bein' taken advantage of by da wich!""

Being a good hostess and swightwy fwightened, I acquiesced. Fow the next houw Bewnie and his bus fwiends watched MSNBC and discussed Mawxist theowy in the fwont woom. I heawd one young man excwaim, ""That Chwis Hayes is just SO sexy! I wouwd do him untiw next Thuwsday!""

They occasionawwy weft to gwab snacks and booze and one of them expwessed disgust at the ""wastefuwness of my singwe-use papew pwates.""

I mingwed mostwy with my invited guests since even an appeawance in the wiving woom to offew up a dwink ow appetizew was met with somewhat hostiwe gwances. At one point a giww with a Che shiwt said, ""That's a nice wedding wing... did you know that the diamond was pwobabwy mined by a stawving chiwd wiving in swave conditions?"" As I backed out of the woom a bwoccowi fwowet fwew ovew my head and hit the waww as Bewnie bewwowed, ""Sandwa, you awe a vegan and I'm pwetty suwe that these vegetabwe dips contain daiwy!""

At 7:45 I was wooking fowwawd to the end of this nightmawe, but Bewnie appwoached me. He said, ""I found mysewf taking a wook in the haww cwoset and I found this heah bottwe of Veve Cwicket champagne. I heawd it's good stuff!""

""I I I am saving that fow Vawentine's Day..."" I stuttewed.

""You ah actin' wike an awwagawk. Hoawding aww the weawth in youw cwoset. What kind of a good hostess doesn't offew hew guests the best stuff...my Medicawe fow aww pwan and nationawizing of US industwies is meant to pwevent just this kind of injustice. You need to open this heah champagne ow you awe a totawitawian awwagawk who hates the wowkahs!""

*Cowk pop*

So it's eight. My invited guests thank me fow the intewesting cocktaiw pawty and weave.

As I tuwn towawds the wiving woom to give the Bewnie bus a gentwe wemindew that the pawty is ovew, he's wight thewe... wight thewe in my face. He's wuddy and his haiw is sticking up aww ovew. He jabs his fingew in my stewnum and says, ""You have ovew-sewved me. I am in no shape to dwive my fwiends back to the centew. Thewe was so wittwe food that we awe AWW ovew the wimit and to be honest, it's a big house you got heah, thewe's woom fow aww of us to just spend the night. Pwus, Maddow is on and that gaw is pwetty consewvative, but sometimes she weawwy has something impowtant to say.""

I go to the kitchen to do some cweawing up and can ovewheaw the convewsation in the wiving woom. It's mostwy Bewnie tawking. As I open the fwidge, I heaw him yeww, ""Don't be putting those snacks away...aftah Maddow I have pwanned to do a wectuwe on Sauw Awinsky's Wuwes fow Wadicaws and that awways makes peopwe hungwy.""

I weady some beds and gwab aww of the extwa piwwows and bwankets. At this point I'm actuawwy encouwaging booze consumption in the hope that peopwe wiww just pass out. I smeww weed. Too faw. I entew the wiving woom and say, ""It's one thing to come to my pawty and demand to stay, it's anothew thing to do something iwwegaw that can have the powice knocking on my doow...""

""Okay boomew..."" says Bewnie. The gen x-ew in me intewnawwy scweams as Bewnie's guests dissowve into waughtew at his vewy owiginaw, cwevew and totawwy not hackneyed joke.

Finawwy, at midnight, they seem to be about to go to sweep. I move my biwdcage into the bedwoom and wock the doow behind me because I heawd two of them pwotting to wewease my cockatiew into the fweezing wintew night because, ""It's immowaw to cage a pet wike that. Biwds bewong in natuwe.""

Siwence descends and aww is weww. The Bewniebus is asweep and I wook fowwawd to saying goodbye in the mowning. I wake at 9 and tiptoe awound the bodies to make mysewf a pot of coffee. I cwean the kitchen quietwy. At ten AM Bewnie shuffwes into the kitchen in what appeaws to be my husband's wobe and swippews. ""I hope you don't mind. I appwopwiated these fwom the waundwy woom. I saw that youw husband has thwee wobes. If you don't mind...I'd wike to take this one home with me on account of I onwy have one wobe. And this one heah is a good wobe that I weawwy wike.""

I simpwy sip my coffee in siwence. Bewnie hewps himsewf to a banana. Then he says:

""Hey, my chums awe gonna be hungwy when they wake up awound noon. Why don't you get some food weady fow them?""

I say, ""You came to a cocktaiw pawty, ate the food I sewved and now you want continued feeding? When youw chums wake up, you can piwe in the Bewnie van and go to Denny's.""

""Cowpowate scum! If we went anywhewe we'd go to some wocaw business with ethicawwy-souwced...yadda yadda...but WHAT if I towd you that I know how to make a pot of soup using onwy one stone?""

Weww, you know how this stowy goes. I give Bewnie a pot of watew and he finds a stone in the back yawd. He puts it in the pot excwaiming how gweat this stone soup is gonna be. Then he stawts wooting awound in the fwidge. ""This hambuwgew you got heah is gonna make my stone soup so much bettew! Wook heah! Cawwots! Those awways impwove stone soup! Oh, some tomatoes...I'm gonna add those to my soup I'm making using onwy a stone and...hey, can you maybe swice that onion ovah thewe? I can't do evewything by mysewf...when I was on the Stawinist kibbutz in Iswaew, I became an expewt in how to make soup with onwy one stone, but we hafta shawe the wowk woad, youknowwhatImean?""

So I gwab the onion and I swice it in hawf. The wage of a thousand dead kuwaks begins to buiwd in my souw and animus wises hot wike a pokew. Teaws spwing to my eyes. Fwom the onion? Maybe...

The next thing I know, I find mysewf shouting, ""OUT! GET. OUT!""

Bewnie suddenwy wooks wike a bewiwdewed owd man. ""You shouwdn't abuse an ewdew wike this you know...""

So I say, ""Siwi, pway The Intewnationawe at maximum vowume.""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8EMx7Y16Vo

""OUT!"" I scweam... wawking woom to woom wousing the Bewnie Bwos fwom theiw sweep. ""Out! Now!"" I say... showing them the doow. One named Wodewick says, ""Oh no. You used scented detewgent on the bwanket that I cuddwed undew wast night and now I have hives!""

""OUT!""

As the wast one wipes the sweep fwom hew eyes and the gwoup is finawwy on the fwont wawn, Bewnie says to me, ""Say... can you fwont me some gas money? The tank hewe is about empty and aww these guys donated theiw cash to my campaign wast night and I can't use campaign funds fow pewsonaw business.""

I swam the doow.

The state of my onion is bad. It's divided and thewe awe teaws."

5,2020-02-28 22:00:38,eytmpa,That's great! I enjoyed it. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
6,2020-02-01 22:56:43,exde00,Just make your posts private if you’re using them for other purposes to avoid this
7,2020-02-13 20:53:48,exde00,"I posted on Imgur just so I can post on Reddit, and I forgot it wasn't hidden, got lots of downvotes and bully from them lmao. A community that I'll never want to be in"
8,2020-02-13 20:56:01,exde00,They literally downvote and shit talk anything.
9,2020-02-13 21:00:19,exde00,"I don't understand why they are so butthurt, it hurts my feelings :-( 
But yeah, I've been in a lot of different communities and IMGUR is by far the worst"
10,2020-02-13 21:08:52,exde00,"I.don't understand either, it‘s really pure toxic."
11,2020-01-30 06:29:15,ew0ymi,"The problem is that the casual watchers (who are like 98% of the viewers) don’t usually remember many old schoolers, and the ones that they do remember have already been brought back by now."
12,2020-01-30 06:50:05,ew0ymi,"I think part of the problem is Jeff is counting the eras a bit differently, and he’s also counting seasons represented, not just the number of people. So for example Amber is representing season2 and Rob season 4, so in his head he has a lot of the beginning covered."
13,2020-01-30 11:04:54,ew0ymi,"I think this season is fairly good at representing all eras.

Of course more recent winners are going to make up a lot of the cast but that’s probably because they are in a phase of life that is ready to come back and the casual fans remember them better.

The only one (aside from Rich) that I feel they have slept on is Tina, who casual and hardcore fans will both probably appreciate.

Dare I say she’d be more attractive to casuals than Denise who would fit a similar profile.

But the range is about right. They’ve done really really well with the cast."
14,2020-01-30 06:27:16,ew0ymi,You do realize some people just don’t want to return. Players get deep dived on what they have been up to and if any of them are still eligible to return they might just decline the offer.
15,2020-01-30 06:40:29,ew0ymi,"Yeah well CBS should wise up and realize that's a good way to get people to subscribe to All Access and go back and watch the old seasons. With how many new viewers are watching old seasons now to prep for S40, maybe they will finally figure that out."
16,2020-01-30 06:38:06,ew0ymi,"I completely get that argument. But to counteract it, I would say, that's great because now you have a chance to introduce them to people who they've never seen before, which will make them want to go back and discover older Survivor seasons which bought the show where it is today. It's why I was so delighted that Danni Boatwright is coming back this season, it shines a brighter light on Guatemala for viewers who are new to the show.

I look at it like Star Wars. My first ever Star Wars I saw was The Force Awakens. I was aware and knew who the original characters were, but was unfamiliar of them. Yet I still enjoyed seeing them because of the nostalgia. People get excited when faces from a bygone time make a new appearance to reappear. My own Mother has never seen Survivor but thinks it's great that there's people coming back after 16 years of absence, proving that people like the nostalgia."
17,2020-01-30 06:53:19,ew0ymi,"I think that's exactly the problem Probst has.

Although I like them both and I am happy to see them both out there, to achieve an equal representation of seasons, I'd cut Sarah and Sophie from the pool, and bring in Tina Wesson and Natalie White. That way, you truly have an equal depiction of all seasons of Survivor."
18,2020-01-30 06:32:02,ew0ymi,"I do, which is why at the end of my OP, I say that Survivor should consider those who actively say they want to return for a 2nd/3rd/4th or even 5th chance at playing. I've seen the likes of Jerri Manthey begging to play again, the fans are desperate to see her out there again, she is a legend in Survivor (it's an example of someone who would be perfect for a Generations season), why can't we see her play again?

I'm well aware players will decline, but the point I'm making is on representation of all of Survivor, and offering a chance to those who are hungry for it, that shouldn't be sidelined because their season was 18 years ago."
19,2020-01-30 11:01:33,ew0ymi,"Casual viewers are HIGHLY unlikely to go back and watch older season on catch up, especially the pre-HD seasons.

There’s too much other stuff available. For most casuals it’ll be an hour a week and then they won’t think about it til next Weds."
20,2020-01-30 06:56:16,ew0ymi,"Wouldn’t that still not be equal, since Sarah is from the thirties not the 20’s? You’d have to cut Denise or Natalie A or Kim which I think would be pretty brutal. And even the males from that group are strong (Rob, Tyson, Tony)"
21,2020-01-30 07:01:13,ew0ymi,"When I said to cut out Sarah and Sophie, I was using the Probst logic. That's where I got the figures from. I took their origin seasons as basis for which eras they represent."
22,2020-01-30 07:02:34,ew0ymi,Oh ok I gotcha.

I don't see any policies from Corey Strong.

I heard from some people here on this subreddit that Kahele is in some way corrupt.

For Lindsay Boylan, I was taken to a link a while ago, it's now disabled, that said she had connections to Wall Street."

I think both Strong & Hoadley don't broadcast policy positions, I just think that Justice Democrats & BNC wouldn't endorse them if they were not progressive.  They usually give criteria that they must meet before endorsing.  As for Kahele & Boylan, there websites speak for themselves.  I don't think we should be the arbiters of who we think might be corrupt based on hearsay from some.  Ultimately policy positions are the most important.

I see Ben almost getting hurt and coming back to medicine.  Maybe anesthesia.

Bailey steps down and Richard takes over.

Bailey was happiest bossing interns not dealing with monthly budget reports.

Maybe they can end the show when Meredith becomes Chief of Surgery."
72,2020-01-26 20:25:17,euc9d5,"I don't think they are. They still have Ben over at Station 19 so if they're writing Bailey out, they're writing Ben out for their other show.

I think Richard has a better shot at leaving over Bailey."
73,2020-01-28 02:47:51,euc9d5,"I don’t think they are. I hope not. However, they need to write some characters out because I feel like there are way tooo many characters on the show now. I just feel like .... They don’t mesh well, so they keep doing storylines that only involve like 1 to 3 characters at a time..."
74,2020-01-27 17:47:43,euc9d5,"Sandra Oh’s exit was [announced in an interview she did with The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/sandra-departing-greys-anatomy-season-594134). The interview was about six weeks before the S10 premiere. She also did the whole talk show circuit after S10 premiered.  

I don’t think Chandra Wilson (Bailey) will leave before S17. She also directs, in addition to being a cast member, so I think that’s a bit more incentive to stay. Kevin McKidd (Owen) has that same benefit. 

I’m crossing my fingers that next season will be Grey’s last. Contracts for the remaining three originals are through S17. It gives Grey’s enough time to wrap up because it really is time to stick a fork in this show."

Especially since they never divulged anymore information about it. 

My question is about the phone call she had with her sister (or friend - my mind went blank for a moment). Surely Sandra didn't just say she was going to die in that house out of the blue. I wonder what the context of the conversation was just before she said that. Was it something like ""I feel like someone's going to kill me"" or was it something more innocent? Surely the conversation didn't just end with Sandra saying that."

Probably not long til an outcome’

Then I went back to the top of the write up. 1997.

Seriously ? - fucking - 1997 and that’s the best they can do with that case. 23 years. 

This one doesn’t sound like rocket science. So I’m really confused. Someone has dropped the ball early on maybe."

89,2020-01-26 05:41:57,eu0zw9,"Good point I agree. Lying about going into the house could be just that. And maybe the police have already sorted that out with her. And thats not released to the public as information. 

Fingers crossed that some interest from the news articles might shake out some information somehow."
90,2020-01-26 13:23:02,eu0zw9,">she may even have just instinctively lied because she immediately thought ""if i say i went in there, they'll accuse me!"" and after her impulsive bullshit was too scared to back down lest it further implicate her.

This for sure.  I have an irrational fear of being falsely accused of a crime and sense that my first impulse would be to lie about some little detail that might make me seem suspicious.  Of course, lying would imply guilt — so, irrational fear validated!"

No, Rafe said in his exit press that production ""guaranteed"" Stephenie final 2 if she acted like an asshole. This was done to actually benefit Danni.

Don't you think it was also strange nobody tried to outbid Danni for the advantage? Because Jeff never gave them a chance, it was only edited to look like he did. Rigged!!!

Ha! You couldn't be more Danni Boatwrong!"
99,2020-01-26 01:24:51,etzkti,"Yes, because Danni totally wasn't put on tribes full of physical threats she could use as meatshields. Totally didn't happen"

101,2020-01-26 03:22:48,etzkti,Danni was put on the same tribe as Gary Hawkins who she knew was Gary Hogeboom so she made him lie.  Then he realized how much people lie in Survivor and realized that Judd was lying to him about the idol.  Then people realized Judd was lying and voted him off instead of Danni.
102,2020-01-26 06:09:28,etzkti,"So Sandra winning HvV was also legitimate according to this, yes?"

106,2020-01-26 08:20:41,etzkti,"Stephanie Johnson didn't even get a chance to play the game on ghost island in a 5-3 minority. If survivor was scripted/rigged, wouldn't they give her a chance to play?"
107,2020-01-26 01:49:37,etzkti,"I love this post. People who destroy Ben yet worship the ground Yul walks on are such hypocrites. No season has been as rigged as Cook Islands was for any group of people. Yul has a god idol that could be used through the final...in a season with a final 3!!! That’s insane! Not to mention the ridiculous bottle twist and late merge. I love Yul, but I get mad when people cut down Ben and praise Yul simply because of nostalgia, and it being the “appropriate” thing to do."
108,2020-01-26 22:05:40,etzkti,Lmao this is so true. Danni should be the only winner of Survivor she should win every season because of this

120,2020-01-26 02:48:18,etzkti,It was only the third season with an idol and I think production was still figuring out how they would work.  They probably assumed the players would do something about them instead of pretend it didn't exist.  Maybe Ozzy was a plant...some genetically engineered Survivor castaway designed to take attention away from Yul.
121,2020-01-26 04:35:52,etzkti,read the first sentence of the post
122,2020-01-26 08:27:08,etzkti,Also production forced Rafe to break his promise to Danni taking him to the end so she could take Stephenie and beat her.

Optional to click but if you DO click, it both helps you FEEL the story I'm trying to tell WHILE ALSO giving you choice information that underlines my conclusion.  
Many are simple pics, some are vids, & some are articles. All complete the story.

Most people think Ayanna Pressley is not working with Bernie. **They are wrong.**  
And you find out JUST why in those links I post throughout (the last one seals it).  
I went into EXTRA detail with the 4 members of The Squad spotlighting their backstories so you can see WHY they are the way they are & WHY they joined this Movement.

The Squad are some of THE MOST IMPORTANT set of players to make this Master Plan succeed. I rushed through [**Part 6**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/emka9j/bernies_master_plan_for_2020_the_prominent/) & [**Part 7**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/emkh10/bernies_master_plan_for_2020_the_prominent/) so I could get to this controversial [**Part 8**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/erd8gr/bernies_master_plan_for_2020_the_prominent/).  
I didn't highly promote **Part 6** & **Part 7** because I knew everybody would compare [**Part 5**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/e7lxc6/bernies_master_plan_for_2020_the_prominent/) through [**Part 8**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/erd8gr/bernies_master_plan_for_2020_the_prominent/) together once Part 8 was posted.  
You can cross-compare The Squad against each other & review all parts.

Hardly NOBODY is gonna agree with my conclusion on Ayanna Pressley here.  
I expect that & that's why this will be one of THE MOST exciting parts I have posted yet.  
But it will have NOTHING on my upcoming **Part 11**.  
That one will bring the house down FOR SURE.

Just take your time & read through. It's well worth it.  
And make sure to 'new tab'-click the links to the prior parts at the top of the page (***Continued from Part 7, Part 6, Part 5,*** etc.) so you can compare all 4 members of The Squad to understand it all better.

P.S.: Also Reddit keeps shifting the formatting so depending on whether you use Old Reddit or New Reddit, the post may look rough to read. I post in Fancy Pants Editor from New Reddit. I try to make it as presentable as possible within Reddit's limitations."
214,2020-01-20 16:02:52,erd8gr,"\+NetWeaselSC Oh yeah. You're gonna LOOOOOVE **Part 11**, baby.  
And recent events make it EVEN MORE juicy. People will not believe it.  
And that's what I like.

Ayanna Pressley in **Part 8** was the taste test.  
**Part 10** will be an appetizer. And **Part 11** will be the full course meal.  
But what's said here about Ayanna is already mind-blowing enough.  
WHY is she endorsing Elizabeth Warren when the other 3 of The Squad are in the tank for Bernie Sanders? WHY?  
Is she REALLY not part of The Squad? Well no, [AOC's](https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1217544811345010688) new puppy [Deco](https://twitter.com/AyannaPressley/status/1217594606319218690) proves that.  
The girls are still sisters right on. The Squad is still a group of 4.

WHY did Ayanna vote FOR that [Anti-BDS bill](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/bethbaumann/2019/07/24/hot-take-pressley-explains-why-she-broke-with-the-squad-and-voted-to-condemn-bds-movement-n2550587) when the other 3 of The Squad voted against it? WHY? But then again, WHY did Ayanna ALSO be a [co-sponsor](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/496/cosponsors?searchResultViewType=expanded&KWICView=false) on that Ilhan, Rashida, & John Lewis bill saying that All Americans have the right to participate in boycotts in pursuit of civil & human rights at home & abroad as protected by the 1st Amendment?

Ayanna Pressley is a 5'10"" healthy-bodied dark-skinned Black Woman with an intense personality & demeanor. She TOWERS over the other 3 if you ever noticed in pictures.  
Rashida Tlaib is about 5'6"" maybe. AOC is about 5'4"". Ilhan maybe 5'1"" or 5'2"" at most.  
So big Ayanna can't BE much of a spectacle causing commotion because she sticks out too much. She causes THE LEAST controversy & ""Right Wingers"" tend to ignore her on her own.  
So let little AOC be THE STAR & **The Leader** getting all the attention with her razzle-dazzle.  
Let petite li'l Ilhan draw the fire from AOC as the distinct-looking **Lightning Rod**.  
Let medium-sized Rashida split the difference between Foreground & Background as she helps out as **The Assist** tag-teaming on The Squad's missions.  
Meanwhile big Ayanna shakes off the spotlight focus & hides in plain sight as **The Secret**.  
They wanna draw me out of hiding? OK all Squad gets together & shows out.  
Press conference over? OK let me shake off that spotlight.  
If I vote this way or do this move, they stop following me & I can do my work quietly behind-the-scenes. She does it every single time. Always splitting from the other 3.  
And once she does it, the intense spotlight is off of her.  
She can get small press as in saving frozen-on-stage Warren in Atlanta or larger press like coming down with alopecia & going bald but not big press like what's happening to Ilhan who ""The Right"" is trying to utterly ELIMINATE.

They all perform a certain role, NetWeaselSC. Watch long enough & you'll see it.  
I hope get **Part 11** to you before the Iowa Caucuses start.

[**Part 11**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/fe0shl/bernies_master_plan_for_2020_the_prominent/) is finally HERE & posted to r/WayOfTheBern!!  
EVERYTHING will be explained there.

Also, look over [**Part 9**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/fbooqa/bernies_master_plan_for_2020_the_prominent/) & [**Part 10**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/fbp0gc/bernies_master_plan_for_2020_the_prominent/) to get the background on those Non-Squad members of the Justice Democrats AKA The Incumbents.

And yes, there will be a **Part 12** but it's a shorter piece.  
A little controversy may be in that one as well...but we'll see.

219,2020-03-05 20:18:43,erd8gr,"\+Scientist34again Well, it looks like since you posted this on January 20, 2020, Bernie Sanders fundraised for that very Ayanna Pressley you doubted.  
Why would he do that for someone not in his Movement?

Well I'll take the pressure off. Ayanna in [**Part 8**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/erd8gr/bernies_master_plan_for_2020_the_prominent/) was just the appetizer.  
[**Part 11**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/fe0shl/bernies_master_plan_for_2020_the_prominent/) is the full course meal. And you'll STILL probably be doubtful.  
But it'll be no less true.

Make sure **Part 11** is stickied so EVERYBODY gets to chime in.  
And take a peek at [**Part 9**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/fbooqa/bernies_master_plan_for_2020_the_prominent/) & [**Part 10**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/fbp0gc/bernies_master_plan_for_2020_the_prominent/) to get to know the OTHER 3 Justice Democrats a little better. The ones NOT in The Squad AKA **The Incumbents**.

And yes, there will be a **Part 12**. Couldn't fit everything in **Part 11** like I wanted to.  
It's a shorter piece than the others so don't worry. A few surprises in there maybe though.

John Lucas"
220,2020-01-20 15:30:51,erd8gr,"\+Scientist34again I don't blame you for thinking that. It's hard to read these associations & coordinations. I have figured out A LOT about how politics works since 2016.  
There's a Upfront, a Behind-The-Scenes...and a BEHIND-The-Behind-The-Scenes.  
And it's that THIRD category where the magic happens.

How I figured a lot of this stuff out is not just looking at the scene from the ""Left Wing"" view. I had to ALSO look at the scene from the ""Right Wing"" view too.  
I had to get more nuanced than just simple 'Corporate Democrats' & 'True Progressives'.  
That's how I USED to look at things & it's not a bad way to look at things either.  
But you miss a lot with that simple dichotomy.  
I had to challenge MY OWN biases & kneejerk reactions to catch what's going on.  
It turns out that some ""Right Wingers"" can sniff out a lot of stuff that I can't see from ""The Left"". They're on to us in a lot of ways even though there's a lot of bullshit to sift through.  
And once I combined that view with my default ""Left Wing"" view, a lot of stuff opened up to me. I have just BEGUN to see how political maneuvering goes on.

Also, I had to rethink how politicians get co-opted. I had to look at it in a deeper way than just corporate donations & lobbyists. THERE ARE a lot of good people in government.  
The problem is it's harder to buck the system when you have a mortgage to pay off & kids to put through school & so forth. Once you work as a lawmaker long enough, you ain't GOING back to being a fast food cook or a janitor or a stocker at a grocery store.  
That's the definition of overqualified for the position.  
You're trapped by your lifestyle so you play ball to keep your position.  
If you cross the power structure, then the attack will come from an angle you may not see coming & then you're taken out. A Democrat can secretly connive with a Republican to take out a Democratic rival & vice versa. That's how the scandals pop off.

That's what makes INDEPENDENT Bernie so unique. He was able to play this dangerous Inside game for DECADES without getting fucked up by that shadowy system.  
An Outside game alone does not bring change. You need your Insiders.  
You need a team. You need strategy. And you need YOUR OWN sleight of hand.  
So many hardcore socialists sneer at Bernie for working with the Democrats but it is that VERY leverage with the Dems how Bernie has popped this Socialist Movment we have now.

Bernie is using Open & Shadow strategies to get past this Establishment.  
Some players are in the open & some players are clandestine.  
How you figure out who's who is FIRST figuring out EXACTLY WHO that person is to their core. What is their history? What is their background? How did they become what they became? What drives them & WHEN did they start to become politically involved? Why?  
THEN once you got a good feel on that, you look at how they maneuver politically through a variety of wide-ranging sources. Their history of political moves & motives.  
THEN you compare how the players interact with each other.  
How they loudly signal between one another & how they quietly signal between one another. Most people will never see it because most people don't dig through those Twitter feeds, Instagram posts, & such. And you CAN'T just look at their direct feed, you gotta look at those random anonymous people who make posts & take pics OF them as well.  
You find A LOT of shit that way. It's extremely subtle sometimes & that's how most people miss the connections.

When it comes to Ayanna, I gotta look at her history with her mama...and her daddy.  
I gotta look at her past traumas & past strivings. To go to this exquisite school trying to escape generational poverty & oppression only to catch so much hell personally.  
To understand that when she was FORCED to drop out of Boston University being a NON-graduate, she got SAVED by Joe Kennedy II & John Kerry who hired her WITHOUT a complete college education. To know that her entire career is made BECAUSE of these 2 men & that her political future is tied to them regardless of what positions they take.  
So is it ANY SURPRISE that Ayanna is gonna be more attuned to The Establishment?  
Is it ANY SUPRISE that Ayanna who is tightly bound to a mother activist chose to do her activism from within the system with professional office clothes over direct action?  
Is it ANY SURPRISE that with her father having his troubles in the prison system, her being sexually abused by a man FOR A DECADE when she was a child, getting raped by a man as a college student, that she is gonna be more biased towards Women?

So knowing all of this you can understand why Ayanna was with HER, Hiilary in 2016.  
She plays team sports with Team Democrat because that's who made her & she wants to see that Female President at all costs. Bernie comes in & ruins it so she goes crazy.  
But then she's not REALLY against Bernie either because she ALSO has those activist roots.  
But what happens when Hillary is defeated by Trump in that major surprise?  
What changed in Ayanna Pressley in those 2 years between 2016 & 2018?  
WHY did her hair go from Michelle Obama perm to Senegalese Twists?  
Do you think the spectacle of Charlottesville in 2017 got a Black Woman's attention about seeking higher office? And ultimately why did she take the pledge of the Justice Democrats, a Bernie organization, in the chaos of the Trump Era?  
See how she evolves as she rolls with The Squad. Why do Squad members send little heart emojis to her when she backs Warren? When the other 3 are obviously Team Bernie?  
The info is all out there if you look into it.  
Click those links I put in the text to see what I mean.

John Lucas"
221,2020-01-20 18:37:21,erd8gr,"\+martini-meow Doesn't Elizabeth Warren make you mad though?  
Doesn't she throw this whole Movement off? What's THE DEAL with her?  
And WHY would a Justice Democrat & a member of The Squad no less align herself with Liz Warren, THE SNAKE? UGH!!

I wanna tell you the answer to those questions right now but I have to save it for **Part 11**.  
Sorry for the suspense. But I can't drop all of my payload right now.  
All I can tell you is that if you're a Justice Democrat, YOU **ARE** on Team Bernie. PERIOD.  
The Justice Democrats & the Brand New Congress it came from are BOTH DIRECTLY Bernie organizations. They will be the ones who provide Bernie with the Congress he needs as President to usher in the Revolutionary Agenda.  
You just saw one Justice Democrat endorse Bernie just today in Pramila Jayapal.  
Pramila Jayapal is the subject of **Part 9**, by the way. By herself.

The Brand New Congress was formed in April 2016 about the MOMENT when New York screwed Bernie out of the primary with that voter purge & fraud.  
Cenk Uygur & Kyle Kulinski from TYT Network refined the aims of BNC by co-creating with BNC's founders a parallel & symbiotic organization called the Justice Democrats.  
We all know of Saikat Chakrabarti who co-founded BOTH organizations & we know he was the Director of Organizing Technology in Bernie's 2016 campaign.  
We also know that Saikat Chakrabarti helped guide AOC's campaign then went on to be her Chief of Staff. Now he works in a Bernie-aligned organization New Consensus, the think tank that's developing AOC's & Bernie's Green New Deal.

So if THAT'S the story of those organizations, then it's pretty clear that those people who are members within it ARE PART of Bernie's Movement.  
If Ayanna Pressley is a Justice Democrat, then she is A PART of the Bernie Movement.  
And if she's a part of The Squad of 4 Justice Democrats, then she is A PART of U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders' presence in the House of Representatives.  
I'd say those 4 helped move the House's agenda Bernie's way, wouldn't you?  
So the question remains, if Ayanna is with Bernie, then why is she with Elizabeth THE SNAKE? Stay tuned to **Part 11** for details. It'll be out hopefully before the Iowa Caucuses.

225,2020-01-21 04:29:53,erd8gr,"\+bout\_that\_action There was never any suspense about Pramila Jayapal.  
Yeah it would have been nice if I got Ayanna's part out earlier so I could get to Pramila quicker but Pramila is an open partner to Bernie. She was always gonna endorse him.  
She endorsed him in 2016 & he endorsed her.

Remember, she & Mark Pocan, another endorser, are the Co-Chairs of the Congressional Progressive Caucus which Bernie founded when he first became a Congressman in 1990/1991.  
Pramila is the one who created THE BETTER Medicare For All plan that can switch things over in a 2-year cycle not just the 4-year cycle Bernie proposed.  
How people started thinking she wouldn't be behind Bernie is mystifying to me but people like to be paranoid so what can I do?

Same with AOC when she ""hung out"" with Elizabeth & everybody got worried.  
AOC was BUILT by the Bernie Movement from the ground floor. Where ELSE was she going? The clue to where her endorsement was going came in the summer of 2019 when the other 3 stars of Knock Down The House, Paula Jean Swearengin, Amy Vilela, & Cori Bush all endorsed Bernie at once. Both Paula Jean & Cori are running again under the BNC/JD banner & Amy Vilela has already been a feature at Bernie rallies in Nevada.  
If those 3 women got behind Bernie, where do you think the 4th woman of that film would go? It was all about the timing & that timing paid off BIG, didn't it?

So while you like to throw around your snark, prepare for **Part 10** then **Part 11**.  
Prepare for Bernie to make his **100% Primary SWEEP** starting **February 3rd**.  
And prepare for Bernie to become **the effective Democratic Nominee & President** a month later on **March 3rd, Super Tuesday**.  
The 2020 race is effectively over on that day.  
And once again, don't think Boris Johnson is gonna get away with that steal.  
Their robbery will backfire on them. Corbyn's Labour will win in the end.

Who would go hardy-har-har if they stole the vote in California like they stole it in the rest of those states? Can't call yourself a Bernie supporter if you have that attitude.

Super Tuesday was demoralizing to watch. They just straight GAVE Biden Bernie's votes. All of that didn't come from Buttigieg & Klobuchar.  
But it is my knowledge of Bernie's Master Plan that had me more angry & annoyed than despondent. I knew what role Warren was to play there & she played it well.  
She actually kept the steal from getting LARGER as she dragged down the Establishment vote. Her base is not the same as Bernie's base.  
Long proven by Krystal Ball & Saagar Enjeti of The Hill's Rising.

They couldn't steal California & that was the most important.  
They also shed all of their Establishment candidates. That only helps Bernie.  
No more puppet candidates to speak over & get drowned out by.  
And then Tulsi messes around & gets a delegate or two in American Samoa.  
What happens if she gets on the debate stage with Bernie tag-teaming Biden?  
The delayed tag-team between these particular two but well worth the wait.

I hinted at Warren's allegiance to Bernie in Ayanna's piece here.  
You see Bernie fundraising for Ayanna in his e-mails to supporters even though she didn't endorse him & was against him in 2016 for Hillary.  
Now watch as The Squad fully reunites behind Bernie as Ayanna finally shows up on stage with The Chief of The Revolution. Watch how many come with her to do it.  
The Master Plan is at work. Always believe that. That's how we're gonna win this.

No. there WASN'T any surprise about Pramila Jayapal if you know WHO she is.  
What is her background? What is her history? What is her political persuasion?  
That's what you got to look at. You won't worry about short-term political maneuvers if you start paying attention to items like these.

It's very simple. Pramila Jayapal is a SOCIALIST from Seattle.  
She's very close to Seattle's Kshama Sawant of the Socialist Alternative.  
When she made her first run for office in 2016, she endorsed BERNIE.  
Bernie endorsed HER. Mutual admiration society. She's not aligned with Hillary.  
She joins Bernie's Justice Democrats from incumbency in 2018.  
Then become Co-Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus in 2018.  
Bernie CREATED the Congressional Progressive Caucus in 1990/1991.  
Then she crafts a BETTER version of Medicare For All that can transition in 2 years not Bernie's 4 years. The House Resolution.  
How is any of this lining up with Elizabeth Warren? Simple. It ain't.  
She was always going to Bernie. It's simple to see.

You're too busy trying to dunk on somebody instead of having a conversation with people. I can TELL you're smugly convinced how right you are about things.  
You KNOW that Winnie Wong is a sellout. You KNOW that Tulsi Gabbard is questionable about supporting Bernie because she went sideways on Medicare For All. You KNOW Marianne Williamson is not so connected to Bernie.  
You KNOW Ayanna Pressley has nothing to do with Bernie.  
I'm telling you that you don't know what you THINK you know.  
You're not AT ALL thinking about political strategy. You just look at the front picture alone & what some activist puts on Twitter in anger.  
You're not reading into the meaning of political maneuvers.

WHY would Tulsi suddenly switch out on Medicare For All?  
We know she supports Bernie to the bone since 2016.  
Part of his organizations & everything. Our Revolution. Sanders Institute.  
Just saw her support Bernie after Elizabeth's intended smear.  
Do you think it has anything to do with her clearing a PATH for Bernie so as to not get in his way as THE #1 choice? To not out-popular him?  
Same with Andrew Yang. He makes a series of maneuvers that remove him from overshadowing Bernie which is why his poll numbers have coasted.  
But you still see Yang hanging with Tulsi & sending shoutouts to Marianne Williamson, 2 people firmly on Bernie's team.  
And Marianne. She got behind Bernie EARLY in 2015 shortly after he started his underdog run. He was still obscure Bernie from Vermont at that time.  
The clue to HER connection with Bernie is endorsing him on May 1, 2015.  
MAY DAY. International Workers' Day. A socialist emblem.  
There're videos online right now of her pleading with the public to support Bernie in the 2016 Iowa Caucuses & other primaries. She's in the tank for Bernie.  
So if Yang associates with Tulsi & Marianne & was behind Bernie himself in 2016, who's team do you think he's on? Read into the associations & histories better.

Winnie Wong came up with the entire slogan called Feel The Bern.  
She manages People For Bernie. WHO ELSE is she gonna support?  
Is it because she was once Ready For Warren in 2014?  
Well that means you have to eliminate Bernie himself then because he was too.  
He asked Elizabeth to run in 2015, remember? She declined & he took command.  
And about Ady Barkan. Why does obvious Bernie protégé AOC frequently hang out with Ady Barkan? Why are there pictures of obvious Bernie supporters Linda Sarsour & Winnie Wong hanging out happily with Ady Barkan?  
MAYBE just MAYBE there's a little more going on with the Elizabeth Warren situation than you're picking up on.  
You got Bernie supporter Ilhan Omar's tweet to prove this.  
[https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1217507556861579265](https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1217507556861579265)

That's a Squad member right there deeply aligned with Bernie pal Keith Ellison telling you that not only Bernie's not a sexist but Elizabeth's not a snake. WHY?  
And Squad members sent Twitter heart emojis to Ayanna Pressley when she backed Warren knowing how much Bernie supporters would lambast her for it.  
You don't see any member of The Squad disparaging each other OR Bernie & Elizabeth, do you? Read between the lines & things will start to open up.

So enjoy your dunk games but know that I wasn't wrong on my call about Corbyn.  
That was a stolen election. You don't get a super majority for Brexit in 2019 out of a 2016 vote of 51.9% which some once-Leavers have backtracked on. Like Wales.  
Boris will severely regret that robbery. Brexit breaks the United Kingdom.  
Don't think that Queen Elizabeth II is a bystanding figurehead. She is not.  
She will not let you break up HER property. It is called her ""Realm"" for God's sake.  
Scotland & Northern Ireland guarantee that Brexit can't work.  
The House of Lords interfering recently is just the beginning.  
And I wouldn't be surprised if Prince Harry & Duchess Meghan stepping down from senior royal duties is connected to this Brexit mess.  
Queen Elizabeth II is not in a hurry to return to ""The Troubles"".  
Will she do the unprecedented & directly dissolve the current Parliament?  
More likely, the deadline will probably just be pushed back by the EU...AGAIN.

234,2020-03-06 15:11:35,erd8gr,"Good morning John.

Here's what I see happening right now: 1)  There is an all out push to Stop Bernie in Michigan.  I wouldn't be surprised to see Liz come out with her endorsement for Biden on Monday night.  (Not that that would matter.) 

2) The MI results will be announced for Biden as the polls close if they think they can get away with it, or

 3) the Michigan results will be delayed for as long as possible and shade cast upon them if Bernie's vote margin is impossible to overcome. 

Because the only Master Plan I see is the corporate entities bound together to save the world from Bernie.

Plus, /u/bout_that_action is not a knucklehead.  He is a serious fan of Bernie who is  driven by data and evidence and numbers.  There's room for all of our approaches."
235,2020-01-20 17:01:49,erd8gr,"\+kifra101 No, it's not just one tweet.  
That's why you had to read the whole thing.

You wouldn't SAY she was never part of The Squad if you read the whole story & those links I included. On all parts 5, 6, 7, & 8.

Ayanna Pressley was revealed to be part of the Justice Democrats on [May 31, 2018](https://www.facebook.com/justicedemocrats/posts/please-welcome-ayanna-pressley-to-the-justice-democrat-slate-she-is-a-progressiv/456923701415042/), VERY close to AOC's primary on June 26th.  
Rashida Tlaib was revealed as part of JD on [April 4, 2018](https://twitter.com/RashidaTlaib/status/981603720612990988).  
Ilhan Omar was revealed as part of JD on [July 18. 2018](https://twitter.com/ilhanmn/status/1019266556092735494).

AOC was there on the ground floor & is THE ONLY ONE of The Squad built from the ground up in both Brand New Congress & Justice Democrats.  
She is THE ONLY ONE from the original BNC slate to win in 2018.  
JD eventually brought in EXISTING campaigns into their fold later on.  
This was Ayanna, Rashida, & Ilhan among others.

AOC first met Ayanna in Bronx, New York doing a fundraiser for Ayanna in early June 2018 (June 7th). The video's right here in AOC's Twitter.  
[https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1004831086671736832](https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1004831086671736832)  
They became near instant BFF's on that day. They have a lot in common.  
Both lost a parent. Both went to Boston University.  
Both are high-achievers who got saddled with major setbacks.  
And as soon as AOC won that historic primary, THE FIRST THING she did was to tell people to vote for Ayanna Pressley. It's right here on June 26th.  
[https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1011850915069005824](https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1011850915069005824)

AOC would go on to PERSONALLY meet Rashida Tlaib in Michigan & rally for her, Fayrouz Saad & Abdul El-Sayed in late July 2018 (July 29th).  
[https://twitter.com/rashidatlaib/status/1023740067028889600](https://twitter.com/rashidatlaib/status/1023740067028889600)  
Then on August 10, 2018, AOC would endorse Ilhan Omar right before her primary on August 14th.  
[https://twitter.com/justicedems/status/1028065741369536512](https://twitter.com/justicedems/status/1028065741369536512)  
AOC's win was the shot heard around the world & started the domino effect for the other Justice Democrat races. That's why she was endorsing & rallying everywhere despite being newer than brand new on the scene.  
But AOC met Ayanna FIRST before Rashida OR Ilhan.  
And after their primary wins they all became friends meeting each other before the General Election.  
I'm sure there were LOTS of talks on the phone too.  
By the time they won the General & started Freshman Orientation a week later, AOC, Rashida, Ayanna, & Ilhan had that Instagram picture taken on November 13, 2018 that AOC simply said **""Squad""**.  
[https://www.instagram.com/p/BqGTlEPBXXD/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/p/BqGTlEPBXXD/?hl=en)

**Ayanna was ALWAYS a part of The Squad from day one.**  
This name wasn't named by outsiders. Squad was named by AOC herself.  
It's the Revolutionary forces here to change this country. She was so happy & excited with this crew of Bernie's justice Democrats that she just said SQUAD.  
And it was MORE than just being part of this Movement.  
It's also because they had become friends.

The Squad is not just a pack of friends who jumped aboard this Movement in this Justice Democrats thing. They are ALSO playing strategies & performing roles amongst each other to advance this Movement.  
And I have just told you Ayanna's role. Just review the years 2018 & 2019.  
She is a part of The Squad. She is The Secret of The Squad.  
And The Purpose of The Squad in this Movement is to be Bernie's Presence in the House. He's a Senator in the Upper Chamber. He needs people in the Lower Chamber to push the Revolution's agenda.  
If you're a Justice Democrat, you're on Team Bernie. PERIOD.  
If you're a Justice Democrat in The Squad, you're DAMN SURE on Team Bernie.

Things are not exactly as they seem, kifra101. You gotta look beyond the surface of things. There is a strategy being run, being played.  
The Elizabeth Warren thing will be further cleared up in **Part 10**.  
And in **Part 11**, you will see the ENTIRE story on why Ayanna backed Warren over Bernie. You're gonna be floored when you hear it.

236,2020-01-21 03:05:04,erd8gr,"Sure, but many of the links and some of the writing style/formatting are wholly superfluous...amusingly enough, I found more value in JL's comments in this thread than in the unnecessarily bloated, not-very-enlightening-with-respect-to-proving-Ayanna's-true-allegiances post itself."
237,2020-01-21 04:58:45,erd8gr,"\+NetWeaselSC It does. I intended to have Part 8 out on Monday January 13th.  
Then when that deadline was blown, I intended to have it out by Wednesday January 15th MLK's ACTUAL Birthday. And I said it's a good thing I missed my original deadline. Ayanna Pressley coming forward with the alopecia thing helped tell my story better. She was literally hiding a Secret!

But when I couldn't get it out then, I aimed for Friday, January 17th...  
...AND THEN found out my post was too damn big! 40000 character limit.  
AHHHHH! It demoralized me. I had to chop content out!  
So I took a break over the weekend & caught up on missed news that week.  
I had been pouring over links all week & missed what was going on.  
I said I'll have it out on MLK Day Official Monday, January 20th.  
And even here I had to do a bit of reworking to get the post on the board.

My attention to detail is time-consuming. Some links are just for simple storytelling purposes so you can FEEL what emotion I'm trying to convey in the text. The simple pictures showing the person with a certain expression or appearance from a certain era or sometimes a certain event.  
But some links are for information that underline or support my premise.  
So sometimes these can be pics too but many times they are vids or article links or tweets. Whatever helps deliver information.

Strangely enough the informational links are easier to come across.  
It's the storytelling links that are hard. The pics.  
Especially if the person is not highly photographed like Ayanna The Secret tends to be. AOC was easy because there's numerous pics of her everywhere.  
But it's not just finding the pics. It's finding a PERMANENT independent source for the pics. I try my best to use a Twitter or Pinterest link if all possible.  
But sometimes those pics are locked down by original source or you can't quite find the alternates based on algorithms & tags. It's a lot of work.

THEN after you think you're done & ready to post, the goddamn Reddit limit kicks in. AAUGGH!!! It's easy when you write this up in Gmail draft. Much harder when you translate it to a Reddit text box. Frustrating as HELL.  
It's not the words, it's the links adding to the character count.  
Gmail draft can be as long as you need it to be but not here at Reddit.  
Then as we found out, what links will be rejected & force the post to be auto-removed. Thank you for helping me test my posts, NetWeaselSC, by the way.

So yes, these posts take time. And I ESPECIALLY went into detail with The Squad. Their backhistories spelled out their future allegiances.  
**Part 9** & **Part 10** will be a little lighter.  
I hope I can get **Part 11** all in one post.  
Less storytelling, much more informational.

John Lucas"
238,2020-03-07 16:54:13,erd8gr,"\+NYCVG Good morning NYCVG.

1) There's an all out push to stop Bernie EVERYWHERE. That's what South Carolina & Super Tuesday showed quite well. They want to utterly CANCEL this Revolution.  
But as I said before, Warren WILL NOT endorse Biden.  
I don't care what you're hearing from her on TV, she will not endorse Biden.  
She is **The Deep Agent** just like I said in [**Part 11**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/fe0shl/bernies_master_plan_for_2020_the_prominent/).  
Bernie has laid a surprise for Biden in Michigan.  
And all of this ""Woman!"" stuff from Liz is leading somewhere.  
The clue is the last Woman running in this race, **The Dark Horse**.

2) They have SEVERELY raised the level of cheating in this primary.  
Even to MY surprise! We had a high level of it in February but we overcame it.  
They went insane with it from February 29th forward.  
Expect ANYTHING from these freaks now. But we will overcome it in Michigan.

3) Yep. They're stalling Super Tuesday's results for that same reason.  
They want the narrative of Biden the Frontrunner & Presumptive Nominee to sink in with the public so they go along with the bandwagon.  
What you DON'T realize is how much help we'll get from the Trumpsters.  
They're bored & want to get involved in the primary scene.  
'Operation Chaos' they call it. They wanna see Dems at a brokered convention.  
Since there's no suspense on their side with Trump being invincible, many of them want to influence the Dem side since that's where the action is.  
Any time you see an Open Primary state look for MAGA Nation to get involved.  
And with the boost of the friendly-to-us remnants of Warren's base that's another shot in the arm even though more of her base will head to Biden.

I told you back in December of 2019.  
**If Corbyn's over, then Bernie's over. And I know you don't wanna say that.**  
We're not gonna roll over for their cheating like Corbyn's team did in the U.K.  
You can't lose heart now. Either we live on our feet or we die on our knees.  
And I bow to NO ONE. They will ALL bow to US.  
Gotta get out of the doom & gloom & hone your killer instinct.  
There is no second chance for this Revolution. This Is IT.  
There's no 2024. There's only 2020. It's NOW or NEVER.

No one is strong enough to withstand the pressure of fighting this Oligarchy & Establishment than Bernie Sanders. AOC cannot hold. She's too green & likes to err towards popularity. She's strong ONLY with the Movement behind her.  
She's not as keen on being the ""bad guy"" fighting uphill for decades.  
Neither Nina nor Tulsi can do it either. While both are strong, Nina won't have the longevity of nerve to withstand all the abuse quite like Bernie & Tulsi likes to swerve & throw people off which weakens ability to gather mass popularity.  
We see all of the Major players having something missing somewhere.  
It is only Bernie Sanders who can take the fight to them & remain popular while doing it. He has become a Folk Hero in this rise to power.

Bernie did not come here to fail. Gather your courage, NYCVG.  
This is not the time for falling apart. This is the time to charge forward.  
We have already won. All that's left is the counting.  
Trust in Bernie's Master Plan. Tulsi is still in this race for a reason.  
Liz's call about Women's Erasure leads RIGHT INTO the erasure of Tulsi Gabbard.  
We're gonna get her on that debate stage & finish off this Establishment.

And about bout\_that\_action. You may like him but he's an obnoxious jackass as far I'm concerned. He thinks he knows it all because he quotes a tweet trail.  
His problem is that's ALL he does. He just reads what's in front of him.  
He only looks at the immediate surface. He does not look beyond.  
He does not read between the lines. Very simple analysis from him.  
And that makes him susceptible to the roller coaster this Establishment is putting us through with their tricks. He can demoralize you reading just the surface.  
But I give you hope because I can see THROUGH the storefront.  
I posted [**Part 11**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/fe0shl/bernies_master_plan_for_2020_the_prominent/) RIGHT on time. RIGHT when Warren made Bernie fans think THE WORST about her. That's why they didn't sticky it. They're salty about Warren too.  
But watch what I tell you. Warren will come through. This is not 2016.  
And it would be OK if he came to his conclusions a different way than mine.  
But what he does is HOUND you to get his ""dunks"" on you all day.  
He doesn't care that what you're speaking about helps The Movement.  
He only wants to get his ""dunks"" in. Even if The Movement fails.  
And THAT'S why I see him as a jackass. But he's also amusing to me.  
I tell him over & over. I will have the last laugh.

239,2020-01-20 18:20:49,erd8gr,"> If you're a Justice Democrat, you're on Team Bernie. PERIOD.

Yes and no. The only criteria to be on JD was no corporate money. From that perspective, you can theoretically not be on Team Bernie but just agree with the idea that money in politics is a generally bad idea. Hell, you can be a Republican and still be a Justice Democrat if you agree to take no money from big donors.

To put things in perspective Beto almost made it to JD. The fact that he was even up in the air makes me question whether the JD process is as incorruptible as people make it sound.

>But AOC met Ayanna FIRST before Rashida OR Ilhan.

AOC caters to IDPOL way too much for my tastes and honestly, I think the minority aspect of Pressley is the only thing that was appealing to AOC from the start.

>Things are not exactly as they seem, kifra101. You gotta look beyond the surface of things.

I definitely try to look at things beyond the surface but I also don't question people if they are telling me exactly what they are by their actions."

241,2020-03-07 19:50:41,erd8gr,"Oh John,  Your rhetoric is stirring but not based on the facts as I see them.

You've completely missed what happened with Corbyn.  The loss was Not about cheating or anti-semitism or anything else.  **What stopped Jeremy was his failure to state, much less clarify and fight for, whatever his stance was on Brexit.**  He kept that to himself.

  The UK was forced to vote, while one of the top candidates hid his feelings about the MOST important issue to the people of the UK and the other candidate, Boris, promised to end the conflict.  Which he has now done.

Similarly, I'm pretty sure that you've missed the truth about Elizabeth Warren.
Her race ended in October when AOC joined Bernie and since then she has sabotaged US in every way she has been able to.

/u/theghostofJoeHill called Liz the Trojan Horse a year ago and he was right.

on bout_that_action, you and I can agree to disagree.

242,2020-01-20 19:02:38,erd8gr,"\+kifra101 Well let's take a look right from Wikipedia.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice\_Democrats#Ideology\_and\_political\_issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Democrats#Ideology_and_political_issues)

>According to Justice Democrats, their highest priority is to effectively  eliminate the role of money and conflicts of interests in politics. As such, any candidate running with Justice Democrats must pledge to refuse any donations from billionaires or corporations.[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Democrats#cite_note-24) **Declining money from corporate PACs and supporting** [**Medicare For All**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_For_All) **have both been described as** [**litmus tests**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litmus_test_(politics)) **for the organization.**[**\[25\]**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Democrats#cite_note-25) Justice Democrats support the idea of [publicly funded elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicly_funded_elections), banning Super PACs as well as banning private donations to politicians and campaigns. In addition, they advocate for the reinstatement of  provisions of the [Voting Rights Act of 1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965) and a ban on [gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering) for partisan gain. Several members have voiced support for a constitutional amendment aimed at removing money from American politics.

It's a little more than just not taking Corporate Money.  
Medicare For All was a litmus test & Medicare For All is THE KEYSTONE to Bernie's Progressive Agenda. It's THE FIRST policy that opens the door for all of the OTHER policies.

So not only are you running a grassroots-funded campaign in the model Bernie set but YOU ARE ALSO required to sign up for the KEYSTONE of Bernie's Agenda: Medicare For All.  
So I'd say that makes you Team Bernie.

Also, it says Justice DEMOCRATS. Brand New Congress was the one that didn't specify a particular party. Justice Democrats requires you to be a Democrat which in this case is really a Berniecrat. I've heard people question JD's recruitment tactics but there's no question about the platform Kyle Kulinski set. Platform's too solid for flakes & scammers.

It's not ""IdPol"" why AOC & Ayanna are cool with each other. Like I told you they became friends on this Congress-seeking adventure. All of The Squad did. They have a lot in common with each other like I said earlier & they're ideologically aligned. AOC found many buddies on this adventure. It's a sisterhood/revolution thing not an ""IdPol"" thing.

It's hard to see. I can't blame you for being skeptical. All you know is that Elizabeth Warren betrayed Bernie AGAIN & Ayanna is rallying for Elizabeth. So naturally you question Ayanna despite her membership in the Squad & the Justice Democrats. But I'll break it down soon.

**Part 9** will deal with Pramila Jayapal, a Justice Democrat who just endorsed Bernie.  
**Part 10** adds more insight on this confusing Elizabeth Warren issue.  
And then we get into **Part 11** & your mind will be shattered.

On Corbyn, once again I will say that a 2016 referendum that only got 51.9% of the vote & has waned over the years since then CANNOT lead to a Super Majority for the Tories in 2019 when it caused a Hung Parliament in 2017.  
Both parties/factions were split between Leavers & Remainers & Corbyn could not hold the same position as his opponent even if he really was a Leaver himself.  
Those results are FISHY & I will stick to that call. It'll backfire on Boris.  
The Queen is not looking for the return of The Troubles with Ireland & Scotland.  
And no, Queen Elizabeth II is NOT a figurehead contrary to popular belief.

248,2020-03-11 22:31:38,erd8gr,I look forward to the next post. I need some cheering up.
249,2020-03-19 22:00:47,erd8gr,"\+NYCVG Well, since we last talked it seems we have some deserters from The Movement.

**Bernie's Auxiliary, Andrew Yang** wimped out on CNN to back Biden on March 10th.  
But most surprising is **Bernie's Dark Horse, Tulsi Gabbard** wimping out & backing Biden today on March 19th.  
I did NOT see that coming. Tulsi was RIGHT IN THE POCKET in this Movement & to do this shit now has killed ANY future political career she would hope to have.  
Biden won't give her shit & she can forget it about ""uniting the party"".  
Now she's dead to BOTH sides. Foolish.  
Yang was disappointing but Auxiliaries can be Mercenaries.  
Tulsi was a SHOCK knowing her connections to this Revolution.

And yet Elizabeth Warren of all people has NOT endorsed Biden when it was her you thought would back him THE MOST out of these 3: Warren, Tulsi, & Yang.

This Coronavirus is the ultimate Wild Card in this election & is throwing everything off including Bernie's Master Plan.  
They are stealing this election BOLDLY right in front of our very eyes.  
But luckily the MAJORITY of who I highlighted here held their ground & backed Bernie like they were supposed to.

Nina Turner is still good.  
Mike Gravel is still good.  
Bill de Blasio is still good.  
Marianne Williamson is still good.  
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is still good.  
Ilhan Omar is still good.  
Rashida Tlaib is still good.  
Pramila Jayapal is still good.  
Ro Khanna is still good.

We'll see if Ayanna Pressley, Raúl Grijalva, & Elizabeth Warren stick to the plan & don't bow down. The Revolution isn't meant for cowards.

And I STILL do not accept the reasoning behind the robbery against Jeremy Corbyn. I see what's happening to Corbyn & Bernie as the same thing.  
They are INSTALLING these people.  
But Boris Johnson may screw up his robbery yet being callous about the Coronavirus. Corbyn is STILL in the Opposition.

One thing the Coronavirus has done is VALIDATE Bernie's Campaign & Platform.  
Capitalism is FAILING. And Trump of all people is smart enough to become Bernie-ish after taking this plague so lightly. Biden stands NO chance.  
The Twin Dragon, The Water Dragon Tulsi Gabbard is a disappointment.  
She knows better. But it's her loss. Biden is the Titanic & she can sink with him.

I don't expect you to trust everything I say.  
You have your own mind. I just share my observations.  
There IS a Master Plan. And we'll just have to see how it plays out.

251,2020-01-20 19:50:48,erd8gr,"> If Ayanna starts rallying for Hillary again.

What about rallying with Warren?

At this time, I would argue that doing rallies with Warren is more detrimental than doing rallies with Hillary..."
252,2020-03-19 23:33:20,erd8gr,"Hi John,/u/JohnLucas-politics

Thanks for taking the time to connect with me.  Us at wotb, actually, not me.

Your best sentence was, ""They are stealing the election boldly, right in front of our very eyes.""

To this observation I say that the boldness and strength and power our enemies put behind this theft was a greater force that I could ever have imagined.  Our Tsunami strategy just wasn't enough.


Next best is, ""One thing the Coronavirus has done is validate Bernie's Campaign and Platform.""  Yes, even Trump is sounding like Bernie these days.  Biden and Trump will both pretend to care about Progressive concerns, but Trump is a far more entertaining and engaging character and Biden's prospects seem dim.

As far as a master plan, please my friend, give it a rest.  Or not.  You are entitled to believe in whatever gets you through the night.

For me, I see Chaos.  And perversely, who knows? maybe Bernie's star will rise again before the year 2020 comes to a close.

Stay healthy.

254,2020-01-20 20:25:47,erd8gr,">It doesn't matter if she rallies with Elizabeth Warren.

...it doesn't? So actions have no consequences and no meaning? 

Should I assume that Neera Tanden is playing the long game and will actually be endorsing Bernie Sanders before Super Tuesday? Should I also assume that David Brock is actively helping Bernie Sanders by smearing him? Does doing one action actually mean the opposite or are you just insane?"
255,2020-01-21 04:08:27,erd8gr,"\+kifra101 No, Neera Tanden is an enemy to the Movement. And so is David Brock.  
But how many times have you seen Ayanna Pressley downgrade Bernie's Movement since her Hillary days in 2016? You haven't, have you?

It's all about pro wrestling, kifra101. Kayfabe. You need to watch more pro wrestling especially the older stuff which is better. 1980s/1990s especially.  
It'll put you in the frame of mind that you can see angles being run or played.  
The Monday Night Wars era of the mid-late 1990s is probably the best portion to watch because it teaches you about the swerve & switchout better than any other era. The line between ""Good Guy"" AKA Face & ""Bad Guy"" AKA Heel was blurred.

You are RIGHT to be angry at Elizabeth Warren. And that is the Master Plan.  
Just according to keikaku. Liz Warren did Bernie dirty in January.  
Now watch the consequences of that action to understand the GENIUS of **Bernie's Master Plan**. Your anger at Liz Warren is PROPER.  
Watch for the POSITIVE effects that anger will have on Bernie's Campaign as we head into the Iowa Caucuses & subsequent primaries.

**Part 10** adds a little more insight to this Elizabeth Warren thing before we get to the mighty mighty **Part 11**. KEEP being angry at Elizabeth's betrayal.  
Because Bernie's NEEDS that type of FERVENT UNCOMPROMISING ENERGY to OVERCOME the rigging in these primaries & caucuses.  
The entire point of Bernie's Master Plan is to create THE LARGEST MOST ENERGIZED MOST HARDCORE MASS POPULAR FORCE to steamroll all opposition to this Revolution. Once you understand that baseline, everything else starts to makes sense. And knowing what organizations are aligned with Bernie, you can start piecing things together. We got 5 basic facts to consider here.

1. **Justice Democrats is a 100% Bernie Organization.**
2. **Elizabeth Warren betrayed Bernie Sanders in January.**
3. **3/4 of The Squad backs Bernie: AOC, Ilhan, & Rashida.**
4. **1/4 of The Squad backs Elizabeth: Ayanna.**
5. **All 4 members of The Squad are still close friends & allies.**

Those are the facts. Number 2, Number 4, & Number 5 cause all the tension.  
Those are the ones that break your brain. Think it through, kifra101.  
I'll reveal it all in **Part 11**.

People falsely believe that working at Starbucks must be a ""chill and hip"" job because it's become so popular. I've watched so many young people pick up smoking, lose sleep and develop anxiety attacks and depression within months of working here. 

Going a bit off topic but corporate is only concerned with profit so they continually add product (with no where to even put it all. We literally have so little counter space to even make drinks) and they cut labor so you often have to do the job of three people at once. It is a fucking nightmare. You'll be alone on bar with twenty people staring at you checking their watches, laughing, demanding you to make their drink first ahead of others, meanwhile more and more people are lining up to order this overpriced crap.

One lady even went as far as to say ""it's a sin to work on the Sabbath, did you know that?"".....ok, lady, if YOU and your buddies didn't haul your hypocritical butts here right after church for a hamburger, I wouldn't need to be here to ring it up, now would I?

They blame my for not having Dr. Pepper. They blame for polices corporate put in place. They blame me for not reading the debit card reader when it says ""please wait for cashier"" and they have to use their card again. 

This is what I want people to know :

Only corporate can changes prices and policies. 

I have no control over prices. Being mean to me won't change that.  Even telling the people you are with that our prices are high within in earshot of me isn't going to do a thing to change the prices.

I have no contact with corporate. I have as little contact with corporate as you do. 

I don't like the prices either. I make $10.00 and hour. Most that money goes to corporate.I wouldn't by our stuff if I had to pay full price. I don't blame you for not liking the prices. I feel bad our prices our so high. 

I don't like the fact we only refill large pop, popcorn and Icees. We are not allowed to refill anything smaller.  We have cameras on us, doing so could get us in trouble.

Don't ask cashiers to use their club membership on you. We just a few cashiers fired for doing that. Corporate records transactions. Corporate knows.

Everything on our registers are run on software, which is P.O.S. Point of sale. It is a software program. I cannot change anything in the program. That job belongs to software developers. We have a pre-set options with pre-set prices. I cannot give you an option that is not available. That includes changing prices.

We have pre-packaged nacho that come from a vendor. This vendor is from I have no idea where. And me, being a $10.00 an hour have no contact with said vendor. I have no control how many chips come in that bag. If I did contact that vendor and complain, management would look at it as going over their heads, I would lose my job.

We get treated like crap everyday. One coworker lost her grandfather. She couldn't skip work because she needed the money. She was grieving that loss when someone yelled her over the prices, which she has no control over. 

We are just human. We need the money and jobs are hard to come by. We take what we can get. We have feelings, we have families, we have lives outside work.

Just because we are working in a crummy job doesn't mean we are lazy.

They back off, I go back to my bar. But then they come back and start the nonsense again. 

So I, again, get out of my bar...

Bitch #1 is like “it’s been 20 min blahhhh”, I look in the screen and see they ordered 8min ago. So I just tell them “it’s been 8 minutes, now, you can chill out and wait quietly, or I can refund your money and you can just leave, but if you choose to wait, that’s your last warning. One more rude comment, and I’ll get security to get you out of my restaurant. So be respectful, or leave.”
They looked very confused that someone called them out, but didn’t talk back to me. 

They waited for the food, and I gave them dirty looks, to make sure they were behaving, and that was it. But really?? Being rude to an old lady who you can see is making your food as fast as she can?? Wtf?? 

My coworkers who saw it were surprised, because normally I don’t get that pissed, I just act condescending to rude guests. But nobody is going to be rude to an older lady, who’s working her ass. Not on my watch. I wish more people would stand up to assholes, so they know they don’t have a place."
305,2020-01-20 13:38:12,er3gnf,"I'm a teenager in high school and I work at Panera. I honestly love it there, I've made some really awesome friends and the work isn't too hard. The area that I live isn't too snobby so I don't usually come across overly mean people but the ones that I do are always old and have clearly not worked a service job since the 80s. Since working this job my eyes have been opened to the fact that everyone else is simply working their job too. I have never been rude to people working a job and I can't fathom why people would.

My biggest pet peeve is when people come into Panera and leave their dishes and trash on the table for me to come pick up. If you have never been to Panera we have stations where you put your dishes and throw out your trash. I hate scanning the dining room for tables to wipe down and then realizing a family of 6 left a mess on their table for me to clean up. I've complained about this to people in my life and they said ""bUt ISnt tHaT yOuR JOb?"" no. my job is to take orders, brew coffee and tea, take your food to your table, bring the dishes from the stations back to the dish person. my job is not to pick up after the people who were too inconsiderate to pick up their own dishes after they ate. 

People also get mad at me and coworkers for things we don't control. I'm sorry we sold out of your favorite bagel this morning, we don't have any more. I'm sorry we don't sell breakfast past 11am, we don't have any more. I'm sorry we're out of your favorite soup, we don't have any more. 

There are many things I can't fathom about people and one of the biggest ones is why people would be so rude to someone working a job that you are using the service of. I've had other customers stick up for me in situations were a person was rude, I've had people tell me how I should do my job, I've had customers angry at how busy the store is (as if that had literally anything at all to do with us). I know the current joke is ""ok boomer"" but in all honesty it's the Gen x's that are so terrible rude. boomers are just old and usually mind their own business but Gen x's always seem to be so full of themselves thinking they are better than a teenager working minimum wage at a fast food place."
306,2020-01-20 13:42:13,er3gnf,"People who look down on service jobs they can consider low are the worst kind of people. That’s how I sort out people I want to be associated with fast.

Criticizing a waiter who you can see flirting with a non-customer while you have tried to flag him down repeatedly to place your order after he introduced himself and informed you he would be taking care of you today is probably justified. Calling him a trash human being isn’t, but telling him you think his work ethic is not up to a minimal standard as you walk out the door taking your business elsewhere would be."

The training was shit and definitely doesn't prepare you for actually doing the job.

If you go to strip clubs, watch porn or cam girl videos, follow a bunch of fetish models on Instagram or anything similar, you’re shouldn’t be justified in saying you’re too good to have a relationship with a sex worker. 

Likewise, it’s no different than saying you’re too good to consider dating a McDonald’s worker or a garbage man/woman, all while using their services.

I didn’t grow up poor and have to work out of necessity or to help the family support itself like a lot of people who didn’t win the lotto at birth.  While hardly rich, we were solidly upper middle class - Mom stayed home, we lived in a a nice, though not overly affluent, suburb, and my siblings and I all went to good private schools.  If we wanted something within reason, we got it.  We always had nice clothes, got to go down the shore for a week or two every year, parents paid for the parts of our undergrad not covered by our scholarships.  You get it - we had it good and didn’t have to work.

But our parents thought it was important for us to work from the time we could get a permit at 14.  And we did. We worked food service at chains and country clubs, I worked at Wawa, my sisters worked at a dry cleaners, and I even worked for a moving company for a few summers.  It taught us responsibility and time management and exposed to the very people who work the jobs that people belittle.  I don’t see that today.  Outside of a couple of Chick Fil As and a few grocery stores, I never see similarly situated kids working.  It’s a shame."

She would have heard us yelling, the commotion from the room as he literally dying and then coming back to life and dying was loud because it was so chaotic (particularly traumatic event, blood everywhere). I answered her bell after pulling the tiny bit of effort I had left in me, smiled when I walked into her room and she berated me for taking so long and called me various insulting forms of (in this order) retarded, fat, moronic, stupid and lazy, as well as telling me she bet I was sitting on my ass ignoring her call bell because it’s not like I do anything but suck up to the doctors all day. She was completely independently able to walk and move about her room and take herself to the patient kitchen to make herself a tea and grab a biscuit.

I have to give them credit , they knew if they taught us early in life to pay for our own stuff through work when it came to make purchases we would think twice. 

In my area it's common to see help wanted signs in a lot of retail and food service and they're often offering a buck or two above minimum.  The school district here is very competitive and a common theme is parents would rather push their kids to more tutoring and after school extra curricular to beef up their college resumes. Personally knowing some of these families I think it's an easy excuse...

I love the rawness of this poem, and the way the poem is a challenge to know, understand and accept every part of her as she is also trying to reconcile all that she is, her roots, her feelings, etc herself. For those who need help understanding the spanish and imagery, here is a link that  should help:

406,2020-01-16 19:30:22,epg9ke,"I wanted to say something but I was speechless. LOL Thanks for the link too, it was so informative. Love the poem by the way (don’t mean to be ambiguous with “speechless”). The imagery is overwhelming! So glad you posted it! Wow! Ok, after staring at my comment for too long a time (I think it’s inadequate!) I hit SEND!"
407,2020-01-17 05:52:17,epg9ke,I saw her perform this and it was electric!
408,2020-01-17 07:29:32,epg9ke,"Oh wow! How awesome. I'm jealous. I would love to her hear perform or read. I met her once at the LA Festival of Books. Had her sign my copy of The House on Mango Street. I was a blubbering idiot, lol. I have a picture of me look I'l ng completely star struck my BFF took. Then we went to a conversation she participated in afterwards. That was the BEST day! But I've never seen her do a reading. Would have loved that!"
409,2020-01-17 20:47:49,epg9ke,I was a high schooler when I saw her read and I was also a star struck blubbering idiot! So you’re not alone. 😂😂 How wonderful that poems can have that power.

Also, we've seen Tina win 1st out and post merge, we've seen it all."
411,2020-01-15 18:57:54,ep6iik,"The people who say “she will come back one day”, are wrong. That’s just wishful thinking

If she wasn’t picked for this season, then CBS isn’t interested in her at all.

I also wish she was on S40, because I really do think of was her last chance to play again"
412,2020-01-15 19:16:44,ep6iik,"I don’t really like the idea of a cast bigger than 20 people, but I feel if there was ever a time to do it WAW was it (Chris D, Vecepia, Todd and Tina being added in). I’ve not seen Australian Survivor yet but it supposedly works there... then again I think they have longer episodes to balance editing."
413,2020-01-15 18:59:12,ep6iik,"Me to, she could've won BvW and it's sad we probably won't see her play again."
414,2020-01-15 19:00:52,ep6iik,I really wish they figured out a way to get as many winners as possible on this cast
415,2020-01-15 19:16:35,ep6iik,"I love Tina and wanted her back for this season too, but in hindsight I can see where production is coming from. She is one of the OG winners and one of the first truly shrewd players we've ever seen, but her game on Blood vs. Water was very old school and I don't know if it would've played well in the super recent modern era. I think she would've had a hard time adapting."

418,2020-01-15 13:48:27,eow02t,You lost me at the end there. Jodie Comer in season one was impressive. Jodie Comer in season 2 was a *revelation.*
419,2020-01-15 15:58:22,eow02t,I loved season 2 as much if not more than season 1. They’re both amazing in their own way.
420,2020-01-16 02:55:47,eow02t,"IMO, Season 1 was darker, Season 2 is a bit of a romanticized version. Season 1 Villanelle is unpredictable, wicked, funny and mysterious. Season 2 Villanelle is uh, running around in her designer clothes and  that she tends to be more of a sociopath than a psychopath - she did not seem to be in control of her emotions/feelings anymore. I think it has to do more with Eve getting under her skin - she cried when Eve didn't come to investigate the Amsterdam murder. She is starting to show some normal emotions like back in Season 2 Episode 8 when she and Konstantin were discussing about family - you noticed that her eyes were teary and her voice cracked a little. ""I wouldn't know. Mine are all dead. "" A real psychopath like Aaron Peel wouldn't show a hint of feelings, face would be calm, stoic and no emotion at all.    


Well, I wouldn't put too much blame on the Season 2 writer. I mean the pressure of achieving the kind of rating that Season 1 had is just enormous. Season 2 is good but Season 1 is better. I'm looking forward to Season 3.   


Also in Season 3, I hope they'll give Kenny a longer screen time. I like his character - he is not the stereotype computer nerd that we usually see on TV (talks to much, knows too much, spits a lot of nerdy jargon, etc), he just do things in a cool, quite way."
421,2020-01-15 08:42:10,eow02t,Agree. I think this is the main consensus amongst fans of the show. Plenty of shoehorning and going away from the things of season 1. Villanelle had really nothing to do for a lot of the season and Eve's character was terrible. She really went off the rails.
422,2020-01-17 00:38:23,eow02t,"I agree. Season 2 lacked that spark of season 1. Everyone suffered a bit because of it. Even Villanelle, who is an incredibly entertaining and vivid role, was somehow twisted in season 2 by the writing. 

But let's not forget that even if season 1 was a masterpiece, season 2 is still an incredible piece of television. I just hope that the new show runner doesn't diminish the quality of the show furthermore but lifts it more to season 1 standards."
423,2020-01-15 17:33:26,eow02t,Who's doing season 3?
424,2020-01-15 16:28:46,eow02t,"I thought Season 2 was like a murder in itself, killing a great show. It was so awful that I don’t care about it anymore. Joyless, moralizing, unsexy, silly in a bad way, ugly. I felt sorry for the actors. Hopefully, the new showrunner will have a better idea of what made the show so much outrageous fun in the first place. Fingers crossed."
425,2020-01-15 20:13:14,eow02t,"Interesting. I'd love to hear more about your view. Maybe I missed something. I mean, she was great as an actress in both seasons, no doubt. But the material she was given in season 2, in my opinion, was lacking. But, like I said, I'm curious in hearing more about your view."
426,2020-01-17 00:34:58,eow02t,"She's a great actress, there is no doubt about that. But I agree that in season 1 she was far, far better. For one, the script was better and she squeezed all there is out of it. In season 2, the script became more sloppy and her acting suffered. She still did a great job. But yeah, it wasn't as good as in season 1."
427,2020-01-17 11:23:09,eow02t,Same boat. Well to be fair 98% viewers would agree she was better in Season 2. She had more to do and delivered. V moping over eve on the other hand then op would have a point.
428,2020-01-15 20:17:13,eow02t,"Well, I'm glad to hear that. Glad that the season was great in some people's views. Maybe I was just expecting different things, and so was disappointed. Perhaps if I was focused on different parts of it, I would have appreciated it more."
429,2020-01-16 23:49:02,eow02t,"Yeah, I like Kenny too. A good complement to Eve."
430,2020-01-15 10:09:16,eow02t,"Oh, cool. Good to know! I saw in Rotten Tomatoes that season 1 had a 96% fresh rating, and season 2 had a very-close 93% rating, so I had the impression that season 2 was seen as close to season 1 in quality. (But you can't really trust Rotten Tomatoes anyway.) So thanks for sharing that!

And I agree about ""going away from the things of season 1,"" especially in regards to >!""The Twelve"" becoming non-important, and being replaced by catching a tech entrepreneur instead of stopping a worldwide conspiracy! !< -- which seems a bit of a shift. LOL

Also, one of the great things about season 1, now that I think about it, was the team and their individual characters and relationship to each other. In Season 2 >! we see most of them replaced. But I don't even know who those people are. Certainly didn't establish the same sense of caring about those characters as we had in season 1. !<

I was really excited about the show, and thought it was the best thing ever. Now I guess I'll watch season 3, hoping it's gotten better, but am really quite ambivalent about it.

Anyway, thanks for the reply. Good to know I'm not alone. :-)"
431,2020-01-15 18:24:41,eow02t,I feel like season 2 kind of slowed down in order for the writers to create more plot lines and action for season 3. Eve did go off the rails but I think it’s just a catalyst for the character develop that’s gonna occur in season 3. Season 2 was just testing her limits both physically and mentally and season 3 will hopefully be her branching out and experimenting with new elements. Now that I think about it Villanelle definitely slowed down a lot but that had to due with the building Eve’s character which in turn added some emotional depth to hers. If that makes sense. But I hope everything that happened in season 2 is just gonna make for an even more action filled season 3 now
432,2020-01-17 00:59:02,eow02t,"Season 2 was definitely very good, when compared to most television."

434,2020-01-15 20:21:54,eow02t,"Yeah, that's about how I feel, though I still enjoyed season 2, and didn't feel it was ""bad."" Just was so disappointing compared to season 1.

And I still can't get over how it went from >! trying to stop a worldwide conspiracy, to basically just trying to stop an IT chief from selling a product! LOL !<"
435,2020-01-16 03:38:31,eow02t,"I admit it’s a bit of a blur in my memory, as I watched both seasons back to back, but off the top of my head:

In season one, she introduced us to a brand new character, and it was fantastic. She was dark and twisted while absolutely charming. We fell in love with her. She had a childlike sense of joy and humor, yet knew she was deeply fucked up. At the same time, we only saw the consequences of that. It is assumed that she acts the way she does because of what’s wrong with her, but the focus is on the unbelievable things she does rather than why she does them.

Season two delved into the meat of her psyche. We still don’t know what made her like this, but there’s more compelling insight into what’s actually going on for her that leads to these behaviors. She still has her delightful childlike silliness, but it also comes with other vulnerabilities and immaturities that reveal it may all be part of a larger arrested development.

There’s an argument that Villanelle being vulnerable and starting to break down isn’t consistent with season 1 Villanelle. I don’t know if I agree, but I respect the argument, from a character standpoint. From an acting standpoint, though, the range of what Jodie got to do in season 2 just blew wide open. We got:  

-killing the boy in the hospital and escaping in his pajamas
-nearly dying in that freak’s house
-going after Niko
-reuniting with Konstantin (in those shiny shiny pants)
-breaking down in Amsterdam
-“grieving” when she’s assigned to kill Eve
-smell ya later
-Billie!!
-her monologue in the AA meeting
-texting eve because “she might be lonely”
-feeling needed/wanted by Eve
-learning that Eve isn’t “hers” in Rome

Shit, if I were in charge, I’d give her the Emmy just for crying in the mirror in Amsterdam and the AA monologue. She’s a treasure."
436,2020-01-15 15:43:59,eow02t,I felt the same way >!about the new team. I missed Elena from the first team :(!<
437,2020-01-15 16:18:08,eow02t,Rotten Tomatoes scores just mean the percentage of critics that liked it
438,2020-01-15 20:27:38,eow02t,"I agree that season 2 set up for season 3. After all, the show is called ""Killing Eve,"" so it's clear that the show >! is the development of Eve's character, presumably to being a killer, sort of like Breaking Bad was. The scene in the first episode where she talked the method she would use to murder her husband and dispose of his body sort of gave that away. !< 

So, yes, season 2 set up for season 3. But it still could have been much better. No reason for things to ""slow down"" in order for the characters to develop. Look at Breaking Bad. How much did that show ""slow down"" from season to season as the main character went through a tremendous metamorphosis? I'd say none. Same could have been here."
439,2020-01-16 00:14:17,eow02t,Oh no I wanted Phoebe
440,2020-01-15 21:34:08,eow02t,"Lol I guess I was mainly mad about how literally the showrunner took the problem of falling for a hired killer. Obviously, in real life the issues would be enormous, but the first season had enough sexy fluffiness to it so that it was fantasy, a guilty pleasure more than anything else. You rooted for them to at least enjoy each other as a couple for a minute. The second season seemed to want to remind us how very terrible such a thing would be in real life. The lightness in tone was nearly gone. And it was dull, to boot, with the most absurd plot points. Can you imagine V working for the British secret service? Me neither!"
441,2020-01-16 23:51:04,eow02t,"I agree that Jodi did a fantastic job in both seasons. She's really great. I just don't think the material she had to work with in season 2 was as good as in season 1, though there were a lot of bright spots, as you point out."
442,2020-01-15 20:23:35,eow02t,"Yeah, she was great. :-(

\>! And the new people -- who are they? There's a gal who, I don't know, what does she do? And then there's the cocky obnoxious guy who went to prep school. And that's about it. No depth at all. !<"
443,2020-01-15 20:24:01,eow02t,"Yeah, but one assumes that critics are able to tell good shows from bad shows, you know? :-)"
444,2020-01-16 02:09:45,eow02t,"Didn't we all!

She seems to be a one-season kinda gal. When she did Fleabag, it was for one season. They had to talk her into coming back and writing a second season. But she refused to do more than that. So she seems to like short stints. I guess she likes to keep it fresh or something."
445,2020-01-15 22:04:23,eow02t,"Yeah, I love the way the subject came up. >! Well, he knows what I look like, so I can't go. Who else can we send?? Like there's no one else in all of MI-6 -- someone perhaps trained for such a task, and who isn't an unstable, psychopathic killer?? LOL !<"
446,2020-01-15 22:06:50,eow02t,"Also: >! They never explained why he had to kill all those people in order to sell the product. That made no sense. And why were Eve and the other guy targeted by that killer in the hotel? Who was trying to kill them, and for what reason? And we still never got an answer as to why Eve's boss was speaking to Villanelle in the prison in S1, while pretending to not know who she was. Reminds me of the end of Game of Thrones, TBH, where the whole thing just fell apart. !<"
447,2020-01-15 21:19:34,eow02t,"93 percent of critics could have given it a 7/10 is what i’m saying, it doesn’t mean the show is 93/100 good."
448,2020-01-15 21:39:42,eow02t,"Right, that's right. I sometimes forget that and just look at the overall score (which, as you note, is misleading). I need to keep that in mind. You need to click on ""More Info"" to get the real score (or something close to it). 

So, looking at it more closely, I see that season 1 got a score of 8.3, and season 2 got an 8.2 (out of 10). So the scores are even closer when you look at the actual scores.

Of course, a lot of that is open to interpretation, as sometimes critics don't give shows a numerical rating, and RT has to interpret their reviews. Still, one has to conclude that critics, in general, seem to feel that S2 was as good as S1."

452,2020-03-27 16:48:58,fpwlve,"I love conflict of interest. Not a huge fan of the fact that it seemed to have been created out of distaste for Dual Destinies, but otherwise (if it were canon) it would easily be my #2 Ace Attorney game behind AAI2."
453,2020-03-27 17:12:17,fpwlve,Bro did you see the spoiler tag?
454,2020-03-27 17:11:45,fpwlve,"I'm pretty sure it wasn't made out of distaste for DD, the game even makes some references to DD (like Trucy mentions that having ''a lawyer who senses emotions'' would be cool.)"
455,2020-09-18 01:05:55,fpwlve,"So, I know that I'm responding to this comment five months after it was written... I'm not really keeping up on the AA community as much as I used to (felt like reminiscing a bit tonight about the good ol' days). But I just wanted to say that I did NOT write CoI with even a hint of distaste for Dual Destinies. I started writing and planning the game before DD had even been announced - I started back during that lull when we weren't even sure if a fifth game was going to happen.  


Dual Destinies is a great game and I honestly don't get why it and SoJ get as much hate as they do. I loved them just as much as I did all the other games."
456,2020-03-27 17:13:02,fpwlve,Oh I ignored it because I like spoilers. (Weird I know) Sounds good though I’m gonna play it.
457,2020-09-18 01:48:05,fpwlve,"Fair enough. I guess it was easy to forget that a lot of fan projects take a while to make, I had just figured since Phoenix’s sprite was based on DD and it’s place in the timeline, it was made for the express purpose of replacing DD.

That being said though, I absolutely stand corrected! You are the man himself after all! CoI is seriously one of my favorites in the series though you did a great job.

Also if you were to say, make another fan game and do it patreon supported.... That would be a patreon I would actually subscribe to lol"
458,2020-03-27 17:13:52,fpwlve,"Ah ok, you should play it yeah."
459,2020-09-18 07:26:14,fpwlve,"I get how one might've made that assumption based on the DD suit. Truth is, that specific element was retroactively changed in CoI after DD was announced (he was originally just wearing the original suit). Someone on Court-Records had made the DD sprite, I asked him to use it, and he said yes.  


Glad that you enjoyed it! I've thought about doing something on Patreon before. Not sure if it would be AA-related or not, but I have thought about making a game of some sort. I'm a professional programmer now and am much more confident in my writing than I was back when I did CoI, so it's really only art and music stuff that would be holding me back (and believe me, hiring people from Deviantart to do stuff is EXPENSIVE).  


Also in the process of doing a fantasy novel I wrote, so hopefully that will get published someday. It's currently in the hands of an editor."

If there is any season to watch I would say Philippines."
462,2020-03-27 01:05:59,fpnjm8,"Parvati knew Sandra would win and told Russell that repeatedly. Parvati being right is what makes the ending so poetic. Parvati is very smart and knew what she had to do and couldn't do it, and prophesied the ending. Sandra deserved the win, but Parvati was crucial to making the ending so epic."
463,2020-03-27 01:05:49,fpnjm8,The challenges this season were epic. I think they can’t have as physical ones anymore because of all the injuries that season
464,2020-03-27 01:01:04,fpnjm8,"This is why HvV isn't my favorite season. It was so epic but the finale was so disappointing. I wanted Jerri to make it to F3 and win so bad. Imagine Jerri on Season 40. But with that F3, it was obviously Parvati.

Watch Micronesia!"
465,2020-03-27 01:04:18,fpnjm8,"Fans vs Favs is good. If you like jaw-dropping strategic gameplay and impressive Parvati content, that's a good season to watch. 

I love Sandra now, and her ego is actually part of that lol because I think it makes her more entertaining to watch, but HVV is the one season who I still wish had been won by a different finalist. Obviously Sandra deserved the win if she got the votes, but it's tough that Parvati wasn't the first two-time winner with her amazing gameplay that season."
466,2020-03-27 01:11:14,fpnjm8,Sandra won in my opinion because of Amanda and co really conspiring against Parvati.
467,2020-03-27 01:40:09,fpnjm8,"Counterargument: You say that Sandra couldn't accomplish the one thing she was trying to do, but if you pay attention, she has the firing squad all set up, but someone else steals the bullets. Basically, she may have failed to take out Russell, but the Heroes are at fault for that."
468,2020-03-27 01:58:29,fpnjm8,100% agree. Sandra was just..leftover. And the Heroes liked that she wasn’t responsible for them losing. That’s it.

470,2020-03-27 01:06:05,fpnjm8,"Yeah I loved fans vs favs and it’s been a loooong time since I’ve seen it, but I feel like I need to watch parv win now"

474,2020-03-27 01:21:24,fpnjm8,Not sure but I've heard that definately factored into the FTC.
475,2020-03-27 01:14:03,fpnjm8,"Ooh Cook Islands would be a good one too even though I didn’t really care for her during, but I was obsessed with ozzy so I can relive that again. Maybe I’ll find a new found appreciation for yul because from my memory I 100% thought ozzy was robbed lol"
476,2020-03-27 01:20:57,fpnjm8,"Even though Ozzy can be kinda monotone, he was very fun to watch in Cook Islands. It's hard for me to say if I think Ozzy was robbed. I also really liked Yul's gameplay even if he had help from the god idol. They both played such different games, it's kind of amazing to watch their super divergent styles go head-to-head."
477,2020-03-27 02:11:01,fpnjm8,"One was brains and one was brawn. Both had valid reasons deserving to win. Survivor history completely changes if Ozzy wins Cook Islands. 

Parv might not even win Micronesia, Ozzy indeed doesn’t even go on Micronesia (no winners) maybe not even South Pacific."
478,2020-03-26 09:56:08,fp8f2y,"Being forced to face the facts like that doesn't just cut to the bone, it cuts all the way to the....Marrow."
479,2020-03-26 11:17:26,fp8f2y,">“Congratulations!” Harruux-ta exclaimed. “One hundred years… wow… With Karen… wow… That’s just… Amazing!”

Thank you for making literally laugh out loud!"
480,2020-03-26 09:47:55,fp8f2y,A nice little slice of variety. Did I somehow miss that there were other kalent level societies in the federation or is this new info? Hope you're staying safe!
481,2020-03-26 10:14:37,fp8f2y,"Honestly I feel kinda bad for a lot of the people on the hook.

Some, like what appears to be so with the Secretary of State, were just kinda... naive and dumb about it, and didn't really deserve the horrors that they're facing. I mean his first concern wasn't himself, it was his wife. That bit's really endearing honestly. He seems to be mostly just an easily led idiot rather than malicious.

\*Reap vengeance Mike, it's all you can do."
482,2020-03-26 09:21:40,fp8f2y,"I was starting to worry about you, damned glad to see it was unfounded!"
483,2020-03-26 21:20:21,fp8f2y,I really liked how  Harruux-ta used the old school Jon Wintersmith style of diplomacy from the early chapters
484,2020-03-26 15:21:19,fp8f2y,As we deal with our own epidemic I can help but smirk at the parallels that show even in the far future the monkeys still run the circus.
485,2020-03-26 15:11:52,fp8f2y,Im liking the fed ambassador.  Also glad to see your kicking man.
486,2020-03-26 18:10:42,fp8f2y,"I always enjoy seeing other perspectives in this world. There is so much going on and so many species that have yet to have there day in the sun. I'm still wondering what our little bank robbing frog thinks of all this, I hope her friends are alright. 

As for Patricia, I want to know more about her before she dies. I see no way for her to make it out of this. No porkies are going to help her, at least none who recognize her. No aliens who know who she is are going to help either and I'm sure the feds are making sure her picture is in the news constantly. Whatever plan she came up with was probably sunk by Dawn, that woman is possibly the biggest hero so far and I hope it stays that way since I love every character.  


Oh and plague in story with no help coming for the infected, while I'm in quarantine rocking a low fever. No testing available in my area, and no treatment either if it turns bad. This hit closer to home than expected."
487,2020-03-26 13:11:10,fp8f2y,so who here has more time because of quarantine
488,2020-03-26 17:23:47,fp8f2y,The opening reminds me of the way Jeremy Clarkson would open Top Gear.
489,2020-03-26 23:51:31,fp8f2y,What m(h)arrwoing developments!
490,2020-03-28 00:15:47,fp8f2y,"Jon and Skippy scene ++.

Gods I miss having support like that."
491,2020-03-28 08:48:30,fp8f2y,Don't get covid. Stay at home. Don't want my supplier dying on me. I need my fix..
492,2020-03-28 08:56:23,fp8f2y,"Great to see the story unfold. Thanks for another installment.

Nice touch with the snake alien. I really enjoy alien species that feel immersively alien, and not just human with different skin. If it could creep in to their interactions, making the species distictipn more prevalent, I would like it even more. Then again, both snake lady and Skippy are seasoned diplomats, so they probably know how to communicate with humans in a familiar way."
493,2020-03-30 00:38:04,fp8f2y,"I kind of missed this? How ... I have no idea but this way better response than i expected. I don't think it will lead to war especially when people will understand who the real enemy is. Because of the broadcast and the free information there would be rebellion against anyone and everyone who took the ""longevity treatment"".

Welp either way lovely chapter as always wordsmith, until next time have a good one. Ey?"
494,2020-03-26 09:20:20,fp8f2y,"Upvote then, read the proper way to proceed."
495,2020-03-26 11:56:05,fp8f2y,... Frankly after that meeting between the Feds and the Secretary of State I want a war to burn out the Federation more.
496,2020-03-26 14:20:26,fp8f2y,Upvote then read.  This is the way.

499,2020-03-26 13:10:04,fp8f2y,why oh why do you have to put up shitty ouns like plucium
500,2020-03-26 11:03:41,fp8f2y,"It was mentioned that the Kalent were one of a few founding members, which implied that the rest were as highly advanced, but not outright stated as far as I remember."
501,2020-03-26 22:49:23,fp8f2y,"It has never been delved into with much detail but it has been mentioned either in the comments or in the Tales themselves that the Federation was initially created by several old, powerful species with nothing but the best of intentions.

Those initial founding species, however, have become more than a little disillusioned with what the Federation became and have mostly pulled back from the whole affair.  Many of them also have ceased sharing technology freely as well not trusting their own creation anymore and wishing to maintain an edge over even them.  

The extent to which the original founders still communicate or share technology between themselves is unknown but massive (but non-violent) conflicts between them over the management of the Federation have definitely soured relations between a few of them.  The Veiled Ones and the Kalent almost went to war and DEFINITELY do not get along to this day.  The Veiled Ones ""lost"" and have completely withdrawn becoming a Federation member in name only.  They are not seen in person and even spotting one of their ships is rare.

Despite their species general backing away from the Federation individual members (either with or without the backing of their species) still actively participate in the government and often achieve high offices where they still try to keep things on an even keel.  The views of the elder races concerning these civil servants vary."
502,2020-03-26 16:01:11,fp8f2y,"And the scariest part is that a misled idiot can be far more dangerous, they sincerely believe they're doing the right thing.  They'll work that much harder to make it happen, because it's the 'right' thing to do, spurred on by their conscience."
503,2020-03-26 22:26:25,fp8f2y,"Someone like Patricia much prefers the easily led over the truly evil at least at Mark's level in the organization.

For Mark the patronage of Patricia was a ""godsend"" for most of his life.  Unfortunately for him, dealing with the devil always has a price and now the bill has come due.

Big payoffs for ""little favors"" was literally a deal too good to be true for him and a lot of other people."
504,2020-03-26 09:35:06,fp8f2y,"Just a little hiccup.  

Well that and I got a chunk of writer's block stuck in my writing dingus.  I finally managed to work it loose."
505,2020-03-26 22:28:19,fp8f2y,Whether we knap flint or fly the stars people are people for better or worse.
506,2020-03-26 15:58:35,fp8f2y, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no\_elVGGgW8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_elVGGgW8)
507,2020-03-26 14:29:56,fp8f2y,"As a person who makes his money doing Uber, Lyft, and a couple of other things I'm living the game Death Stranding right now."
508,2020-03-28 01:20:11,fp8f2y,"Not me.  ""We need to you haul this trailer full of supplies into the plague zone."""
509,2020-03-28 00:27:48,fp8f2y,"OK, Harrux-ta is pretty awesome, too.  :D"
510,2020-03-28 09:10:22,fp8f2y,"Yeah,  Harruux-ta  speaks people really good and while she REALLY doesn't like Terrans she has a great appreciation for both their planet and their idioms.  She delights in shocking her fellows with the horribly Terran thought images they conjure up.  

The Xvli are very surprisingly similar to humans both in biology (one reason that trade is so attractive is that a lot of crops are perfectly consumable) and psychology even to the point that some of their obscenity and idioms are directly translatable."
511,2020-03-26 13:59:11,fp8f2y,"Eh, given the way she acted after leaving that meeting, it seems she was mostly posturing"
512,2020-03-27 01:51:43,fp8f2y,"There is a lot of unfinished business between the Federation and the Republic but as of now both really don't want a round two.

The Republic needs years to rebuild and after getting a good taste of what the Republic will do when pushed the Feds are less than eager to enter what would clearly be a genocidal war.  They know that wiping out the Terrans would be nigh impossible and that thousands upon thousands of their people would die for every Terran casualty in the end.

It's classic Mutually Assured Destruction.  The Terrans have little illusion concerning what would happen if the Federation massed the entirety of their Fleet (along with the fleets of the various member states especially the elder races), mobilized their entire economy, and dedicated themselves to destroying the Republic.  It would be bad.  On the other hand the Federation no longer has any illusions about a quick victory and know that even if they somehow (not assured) manage to ""destroy"" the Republic they will be fighting Terrans for the rest of time because they will never, ever stop.  The Federation lost a billion lives last time.  Next time it will be more, a lot more.  They don't want that either.

It would be great to watch the two really go at it but both sides will do a great deal to prevent that war from happening, at least for now.  Once the Terrans get back up to full strength and if the Collective threat becomes truly neutralized then the Federation might be in serious trouble but that's a long way off."
513,2020-03-26 16:20:49,fp8f2y,"Can't help it IRL, can't help it when online. I should probably be punished for it."
514,2020-03-27 20:19:32,fp8f2y,I'm getting Shadow War vibes from that description of the Veiled Ones.
515,2020-03-26 16:09:13,fp8f2y,"Depends, an honest idiot like him, I don't think he's that dangerous beyond what he help instates.

A fanatic, someone who ignores the reality for the fantasy, that's the true danger. Stalin, for example, truly believed in the idea of communism and was willing to sacrifice every single last life to achieve it, for the ""greater good"" of an imagined utopia slaughter by the millions.

The Secretary of State is someone Stalin would have described as a  ""useful idiot,"" a person who doesn't understand what he's advocating for and the full implications, who would only realize what he's done after, be horrified, and then be the first to be lined up and shot once the system is in place, but until then is a useful, ignorant tool that won't realize the terror coming until the jackboot steps on him."
516,2020-03-27 01:41:49,fp8f2y,Nothing is quite as evil as a person who is blindly and totally convinced they are in the right.
517,2020-03-26 22:59:31,fp8f2y,"Well I never really like to call people truly evil, but usually just... well like I said before pitiful, ignorant, vile but in a sad and sorry way, always redeemable no matter how horrible, though Patricia is one that strains that ideal. Anyways, back to topic, yeah, and I hope he and Samuels link up. I expect Samuels, if he's smart, will remain ""part of the team,"" pretending to remain within Hu's influence as much as possible while quietly slipping whatever he can gleam to Gloria. Perhaps contacting those he thinks will be willing to go hell for leather at her after learning of the consequences? After all he has the list of conspirators from the report and people in those power positions tend to travel in the same circles, he also has absolutely nothing to lose once things are mostly settled for his company and planet, thus he can just go to sabotaging and playing double agent as much as he can with some preparations to reveal the terrible events.

The easily led, while initially loyal once the jackboot hits they are easily led by the opposition. It's why usually they're so quick to be executed or sent to labor camps.

It makes sense to use the easily led, certainly, especially in public positions, the problem is that if your revolution doesn't succeed and you can't bring the jackboot down hard enough to stop them from resisting once they realize the problems, they then become a problem for you."
518,2020-03-26 09:36:31,fp8f2y,That sounds frightfully uncomfortable. I hope your dingus heals up well after that sort of violation.
519,2020-03-27 00:25:50,fp8f2y,I'm glad that your dingus has released it's block. I've missed the tales. Stay well
520,2020-03-26 14:34:39,fp8f2y,"im not a big fan of death stranding, I played it a couple of times and it just never piqued my interest I'm more interested in rainbow six siege and cod"
521,2020-03-26 14:00:15,fp8f2y,Then watching the Federation burn as it is crushed by the Republic and the Empire would be even more enjoyable.
522,2020-03-28 00:33:00,fp8f2y,"Or, worse than Stalin (from a percentages perspective), Pol Pot.  Motherfucker managed to kill fully 25% of his *own* population, and if he hadn't been removed from power, was going to hit 50% through simple famine engineered in the name of ""equality"".

And the American sense of history is, in general, so atrocious that there's a pretty significant chunk of it that supports Bernie ""Castro Was Awesome"" Sanders."
523,2020-03-28 00:35:14,fp8f2y,"*Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be ""cured"" against one's will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.*  --C. S. Lewis"
524,2020-03-26 15:17:25,fp8f2y,As long as it didn't prolapse it should heal relatively fast
525,2020-03-26 18:28:58,fp8f2y,"One can be capable of anihillating someone and greatly prefer not to poke such a massive hornet nest at the same time. A large bull moose can kill a lot a wolves, but if the pack commits to it they can bring one down. They don't even try unless desperate because that is a very steep price to pay."
526,2020-03-28 00:55:15,fp8f2y,"Yes on the first point, second point needs some balancing.

Alright I think Bernie's a complete grifting communist moron, but most Americans who support Sanders either deny he actually supports those things, are sorta just grasping for something and ignoring the problems with him, or ignorant of his positions and actions simply through distance, and those that truly support are either old Marxists or kids without real world experience who mostly will grow out of it."
527,2020-03-26 15:59:17,fp8f2y,"This took a decidedly Terran turn, but I'm here for it."
528,2020-03-30 17:09:26,fp8f2y,"Well, that's why I said our sense of history sucks.  Not just ""things that happened other places"", but ""the personal histories of presidential candidates"".

I believe the official communist term is ""useful idiots"".  Or however one says it in Russian.

\*shrug\*

I mean, basically I agree with your point that there aren't many openly calling and hoping for gulags, but they're still supporting someone with an ideology that has, every time it's been implemented, led to slaughter."
529,2020-04-14 05:17:23,fp8f2y,"Or we think that the US should start being a first world nation with a middle class again?  Starting with making sure that everyone gets health care so we don't have 100,000 Americans declaring bankruptcy for their Covid19 treatments?

I mean we have a president who is promoting (while being ever so careful not to break the law by telling folks to take it) an immunosuppressant. Something that can treat some folks when ketosis starts, but before that actually makes life easier for Covid19-and obviously worse for the idiot taking the drug.

But if you do think the drug is a good idea, it will cost you $100 for a one week supply (at 200 mg twice a day).  Just know that you taking a placebo with nasty side effects may cost someone with Lupis their life."
530,2020-04-14 05:26:57,fp8f2y,"Healthcare isn't even part of it, Bernie outright supported the economic, transportation, education, and other systems of the Soviet Union, Cuba, Venezuela, has openly praised Fidel Castro, among others, and continues to defend his prior statements. He supported the Green New Deal, which had outright communism as one of its stipulations where it demanded that all unemployed individuals be mandated employment by government, all of them, that's a direct take over of the economy by government. I can go on and on on this topic. He is full blown authoritarian take control of absolutely everything communist.

The nations he claims to want to emulate, Denmark and Sweden, have both openly denounced him and claimed they are completely unrepresentative of Bernie's policies. Denmark's Prime Minister said they were a capitalist country of ""social democrats"" and asked Bernie to please stop using them. The lead ambassador of Sweden and representative of their main left party called Bernie's rallies frightening and a collective of college students and old Marxists who think they've been right all along, that they are nothing like described and are social democrats.

The middle class has been expanding more recently, before the virus hit that is, we had some fast food companies testing out 6-figure salaries for their lowest level managers.

The treatment is being used in several other countries and has seen positive results in some testing. It is going through CDC approval right now and has gotten past the first clinical trials."
531,2020-04-14 05:43:08,fp8f2y,"I think the government should offer a job to anyone who wants one, though you don't have to take over companies. Just quite literally say ""if you can't find a job we will give you a minimum wage job.  Mornings you will move rocks from the south end of the field to the north end, and in the afternoon you move the rocks south.

Can't do physical work?  You work for the CIA or FBI passing those ""are you a human"" tests for their hacking attempts. Or just doing random ""are you a human"" tests while being told it is useful.

Getting people out of the house, away from video games, and used to the 5x8 schedule is the first step of getting them back in the workforce. Of course minimum wage would have to be high enough to survive on..."
532,2020-04-14 05:51:10,fp8f2y,"...Okay. Firstly how the hell do you think this will work economically? Secondly it is going to naturally give rise to government control over the market as government is the ultimate monopoly. Ignoring the fact it's just not practical and will sink the value of the dollar it's just begging for complete government control of your life in giving that much control and it is absolutely direct control of the economy to do that.

GND had stipulations to take over a significant amount of companies, Bernie wanted to take over 40% of ownership from every company and redistribute it. He's a communist, address the actual points please rather than jump to entirely different ones.

Minimum wage is worthless, meaningless. Best case it changes the base value of cash, rising it is just inflating the value of the dollar, more likely it crashes some industries, destroys small businesses, destroys entry-level positions, and sees people lose their jobs as businesses shrink and put a ton more weight on other employees, changing well-liked jobs to have double the work load and far worse hours as happened in New York's restaurant industry. None of the nordic countries have minimum wage. This is the first thing you learn in economics, it's about supply and demand.

You seem to be basing your policy off of what you imagine would happen and would like to happen without considering long term consequences and the resulting expansion of such policies."
533,2020-04-14 06:19:48,fp8f2y,"How do you pull it off?  I donno, put the tax rate up to pre Reagan levels?  Before the Reagan tax cut wages grew at the same rate productivity grew, workers got a share of the additional goods and services they produced as they got more efficient, and owners got a share.  Post inflation wages have been flat since the Reagan tax cut, which makes sense, basic supply and demand.

If tax rates are high, a rich person can have 30 cents in their bank account, or pay their workers another dollar. A lot of company owners felt that the ""social wealth,"" of having happy loyal employees and charities with their names (think Carnegie libraries) was better than a bit more pocket change.  Once you tell a company owner that they can keep 65 cents or pay workers more, well then it makes sense to keep the money.

Another supply and demand problem we have is the capital/wage ratio.  We have far too much capital sloshing around and not enough wages to buy the goods from the factories that capital could create.  So in order to try to get any rate of return that capital goes into ""the next big thing,"" people ignore market fundamentals, and you get bubble economy after bubble economy. 

It doesn't matter how much capital you have if people don't have the wages to buy your goods, so, solution, start loaning people money to buy on credit and collect interest.  Look at what percentage of Americans are ""below water,"" sometime, which further reduces income because interest payments have to come from somewhere. 

I've paid more in taxes than I collected in military pay as a full LT in the navy, and I should have paid twice as much.  My tax on money I made from selling peices of paper was 15%, my tax for serving in the military was 28%.

We have folks screaming about how horrible the death tax is, effectively saying it is better to tax living workers than dead millionaires, because having the right parents gives you the right to be wealthy. Fuck that noise, in my family yes the kids get a leg up, college, private school if you want it and have the grades, but I don't get a million dollars for turning 18, and when my millionaire grandfather died last month I didn't ask for money.  The family tradition is that it goes to charity and the next generation has to get wealthy on our own merits.  Something I failed at btw, 45 and less than half a mill in stocks.

Yes, the death tax can cause a problem for family farms or businesses, but that is an easy fix, let the taxes on certain assets be deferred. It is obvious if you want to solve the problem, but if you just want to concentrate wealth in the hands of a few and screw the middle class you don't want to solve the problem, you want the tax gone.

What is the US debt up to?  What is the deficit?  When my country went to war I thought it was a stupid war, but I signed up because I am an American. I swore an oath to defend our constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, but now my dad and I talk about what the best country to move to is since the future of my kids matters more than staying in a failing state."
534,2020-04-14 06:41:21,fp8f2y,"When Reagan cut the tax people made negative money in some states if they went over a certain amount. It literally discouraged making money because after a certain point you would lose money if you made more money. In California, the total tax at the highest rate added to over 110%. It was destroying the economy.

You're right about capital/wage being an issue, what you're entirely wrong about is the solution. The solution is to encourage investment and opportunity, not punish success. Wealth isn't a stagnate thing, you can grow more wealth. Too many think it's just one pool, as you seem to do so. If it was such then the world wouldn't have nearly come to lose 70% of its global extreme poverty in the past 50 years (as of 2015).

To me it seems you have a complete failure to understand investment and market spending.

That's a good policy to have in your family, but that's YOUR CHOICE. You have the freedom to do with it what you wish. By having a death tax, you again are immensely damaging the incentives as people want to be able to pass on their value. I'm looking at incentives, opportunities, and growth as the primary factors.

Failing state? What? Job growth was extremely high, as was high wage growth, before the virus. I even referenced that we had some six figure positions in just basic fast food manager positions. The US still has a larger economy than all of Europe combined and was easily winning the trade war, it had been able to completely strongarm China. Sure China is a problem but they're nowhere near becoming a superpower and are surrounded by hostile states. You've flatly just ignored most of my points. You go on complete tangents and refuse to even loosely acknowledge most of what I have to argue. This is pointless, I'm just talking straight past you."

I was invested in seeing Alex and Richard turn Pac North around, and was hoping that it could have eventually turned into a spin off. I do think that they wouldn't have rushed Cathrine buying Pac North and shutting it down as fast as she did.

In episode 13, Joey comes in as a patient and his younger siblings are shipped off to different foster homes, and in episode 14 we learn that it was good homes. I strongly believe that if Justin hadn't left, then Jo and Alex would have taken the younger siblings in. Would have been their road to parenthood, because I always pictured Jo and Alex becoming foster/adoptive parents. Jo especially given what she learned about herself last season.

The 350th episode would have been a good time to end the show.

the second half of the season (minus episode 15) has been such a huge lackluster."

In fact, CDC states that circumcision reduces the risk of HIV transmission by 50%."
563,2020-03-22 17:44:16,fn0yzk,"You went out of your way to be wrong.

This is the problem people have with it. It’s a non-essential surgery with no health benefits (at that age at least, I’m aware some people get circumcised at their doctor’s recommendation) which means the risk, no matter how small, does not outweigh the benefits. Non-essential surgery is fine, but only really if you agree to it. A baby can’t do that and even a child doesn’t have the legal ability to give medical consent. Any other non-essential surgery on a child is illegal for this reason so it stands to reason people think this should too. I get the religious implications but I don’t think religion should be enough of a reason to possibly damage the health of a baby.

If you want to get circumcised, that’s fine. If you want to encourage your child once they’re no longer a child to get circumcised, that’s fine as long as you’re not too forceful about it. But don’t force it on a baby, it’s not your body to mess with unnecessarily."

Since having a foreskin is not a disease, there is very little in the benefit category. Complications are fortunately uncommon but can be devastating. So it’s hard to justify removing a normal body part in the absence of disease. In other words, we should apply the same decision making process to circumcision as we would to other surgeries.

618,2020-03-21 18:47:49,fmhen2,"Oh man, I was really confounded by this one too! My ex-girlfriend went to go see it like 5 times and took me along once. I didn't think it was explicitly bad or anything, I just really didn't get the hype behind it. It really just felt like an okay kid's movie. I could see my little sister really digging it but I didn't really see the appeal for someone who was over 15 or more familiar with Barnum's story. Not that kid's media is inherently less good, it just wasn't offering much more than what a kid could pick up on.

My uncle is a curator at a weird knick-knacky museum about cultural oddities in America, and because of him I was really excited to see a musical about the grimy underbelly of Barnum's weird exploitation circus. Instead, PT Barnum was just Hugh Jackman as a hot singing dad. I really thought that was a huge waste of what could have been such an interesting dynamic between him and the performers. Fuck, he could have effectively been the villain with the performers as the lead if it were more based in reality. Instead the performers take a backseat for most of the movie and have no memorable traits or dimension to them.

Also, not a fan of the tokenism in this movie. I'm glad to see more diversity in movies in general, but it felt more like a brownie points thing. Look, we hired actors with vitiligo! Get ready to not see them for another hour. Real tired of movies doing the bare minimum of being progressive almost entirely for marketing"
619,2020-03-27 20:44:49,fmhen2,"Avengers Infinity War the script was so repetitive, too much cgi, was clearly made to make money, and just not that great of a movie and is kind of a slog to get through.

This also goes with other marvel movies like guardians of the galaxy vol 2 and Deadpool 2 just movies with some decent or funny scenes that eventually have a poor pace and comedy that comes as flat."
620,2020-03-22 04:54:49,fmhen2,Blue Valentine. I could not get into this movie at all. I didn't like the main characters or find them compelling in the least. The dialogue felt off. It felt like every line was improvised by people who don't know how to improv.
621,2020-03-29 09:38:33,fmhen2,"I know I’m late but I’m still prepared to get shit on for this one:

*Raging Bull*

I watched it for the first time not too long ago and I’m sorry but I just don’t get the hype. The technical elements were amazing. The boxing scenes are I’d say the most well shot sports scenes I’ve seen probably ever. The acting was amazing all around, but especially by Pesci. 

I think for me the problem lies in the main character. Jake isn’t supposed to be the feel good hero like Rocky and I get that. If you want to show his fall from grace fine. But the way it ended I felt like the viewer was supposed to see that Jake was complacent with his new life and was trying to atone for his sins. The problem was they spent too long showing how horrible he was that it went from in jail for serving alcohol to a child to “hey he’s not that bad anymore” within 5 minutes.

Idk I just felt like Scorsese and his writers didn’t know what they wanted this to be. Was this an anti hero who you root for in the ring but is human garbage outside of it, was it supposed to show his acceptance of his new life and his attempt at atonement? Maybe I just missed something but for me this movie just didn’t work out. It’s just that in my opinion, if you want a character to atone you have to show some sort of change in the character, aside from his occupation. And if you want to invoke an emotional response when a character ruins his life, he should have at least one or two redeeming qualities 

I don’t want to sound like a Scorsese hater here, as I’m a huge fan of most of his movies. Taxi Driver, Goodfellas and the Irishman are among some of my favorite movies ever. But this one just fell flat for me. I don’t think it’s terrible by any means, but by its IMDb rating it’s either got the same score or is within 0.1 of Up, To Kill a Mocking Bird, Taxi Driver, Vertigo, Good Will Hunting and Mad Max Fury Road which is just ludicrous to me. I’ve seen all of those multiple times and I’ll see them many more times before I die. This is one I’m scratching off the bucket list but probably don’t care to see again"
622,2020-03-24 05:37:21,fmhen2,"Atlantics (2019) honestly the worst supposedly ""Good"" film I have seen. I hated every minute of that film."
623,2020-03-21 17:03:29,fmhen2,"I think the problem is they wanted to make it both a flighty, simple circus spectacle movie and a message movie.

And it's not impossible to be lighthearted and fun and still have a message but, if you're gonna have a message, you gotta have a little depth underneath the spectacle. Zootopia is a decent example of that. It didn't completely get its anti-racism message down but it at least tried to have some depth underneath the cute animals and jokes.

But, you know, if they're not interested in having depth, they should have gotten rid of the message and just focus on the spectacle, even if they are a kids movie. Moulin Rouge! didn't really have a message and it worked out well for that movie."
624,2020-03-21 16:54:50,fmhen2,"\^I agree, that could've been an interesting movie. And they pay lip service to it a bit by having Barnum ditch them and having them all sing an ""F You Barnum"" song, which shows the movie is aware of how complex and complicated the whole thing is.

But then they don't really do more with it, the ""freaks"" after that point are barely in the movie for the next half hour and then, once they come back in, the movie just shrugs its shoulders and has them all go ""Yeah, you were mean to us but you saved us from a fire and we wouldn't have known each other if it wasn't for you so...WE LOVE BARNUM. WE LOVE BARNUM. WE LOVE BARNUM!"""

630,2020-03-21 17:01:30,fmhen2,"From what I've learned about the history of Barnum, his relationship with the people he deemed freaks was really quite fascinating and nuanced. He no doubt exploited them, but at the same time, that exploitation allowed them a basic living that they couldn't get otherwise. There's so much potential for interesting storytelling and character dynamics there. To sanitize it and avoid that goldmine just seems...like a huge waste."

Then again this is what Bong wanted I guess.

This isn't me saying it's a bad movie. My jaw was on the floor for most of my first viewing, however I felt the ending was particularly rushed in comparison to the rest of the movie in an attempt to wrap up the story after the social commentary had finished."

680,2020-03-19 23:04:34,fljs0c,Yeah I really agree with most of what youre saying. Australian survivor seems to have a very formulaic episode structure and... the formula isnt very good?
681,2020-03-19 23:57:34,fljs0c,"Aus Survivor has just been the David show. 

Kudos to him bc his playing a great social and strategic game, but for 3 eps a week and having more than half the cast be invisible and UTR everytime is frustrating. Especially since David, Shonee and Mo are giving such repetitive confessionals. 

WAW is succeeding because air time is split decently and we are definitely seeing more perspectives. 

The Aus twists this year have also screamed production interference every time which is disheartening to the integrity of the game."
682,2020-03-20 12:07:29,fljs0c,"I have to disagree.  I generally like aussie survivor more, but hoenstly, WaW has been weak until just this week.  The ""take out the icons"" gameplay has been a yawn fest.  We know what's happening each week and the only thing that's strange or interesting is seeing the way some players react to the legends like Rob or Parv, who are now both out of the game.  

I thought we'd see something new and different, instead they are selling us this old school vs new school idea, which is bullshit.  It's not old school vs new school, it's average or worse players who happened to win against the legends of the game who broke our expectations, and guess what, the average or worse winners outnumber the legends greatly.  It's been entirely predictable each week and while we've had a few great things (Denise really did something spectacular and honestly elevated herself above the rest last time), the game is already winding down with the icons mostly already gone.  

This is surprisingly similar to what we've seen with all stars.  Great players, iconic for Aussie survivor at least, and a bunch of more average players, and of the big names it's pretty much just down to David.  Hell, Shane was gone day 1 ffs.  It's because she was iconic winner and is considered an Australian national treasure.  Matt's gone, Locky is gone, Shane, Lydia, John, everyone who stood out in previous seasons is out of the game except Dave and Brooke, and unless Brooke wins every comp to the end she'll likely be gone shortly too (she wasn't the to win threat before, but she certainly is now that she's won this many comps and lasted this long, particularly with her entire alliance on the Jury now).  

I mean, yeah, it's kinda dull by comparison to watch at this point in the season, it has to be because that's how the games designed, sometimes it's time to make moves, sometimes it's time to jog to the end.  WaW is going to suffer the same thing, soon, because most of the icons are gone and merge is coming."
683,2020-03-20 13:15:44,fljs0c,"I love both shows, but australian is better right now.

More players, longer game  and more episodes a week really help."
684,2020-03-20 00:25:47,fljs0c,"I'm much more into Aussie Survivor, but as an Australian maybe that is mostly bias. Last night I really noticed how condensed  WAW was. One minute they're talking about crucial moves and bang they are walking into tribal council. No where near as much time spent on building the tension as they do in AS. But I did clap my hands in surprise when Sandra was voted into exile!"
685,2020-03-20 11:02:17,fljs0c,I came into both seasons worried WAW would be too hard to follow with one hour episodes and edge and friends tokens and think Aus All stars was going to be spectacular no matter what. My oh my how things have changed
686,2020-03-20 11:57:57,fljs0c,WAW has been the superior season.
687,2020-03-20 13:18:29,fljs0c,"Completely disagree. Although All-Stars has had an awful postmerge, the pre-merge was not half bad at all. The pagonging of Vakama is probably what sets people off, but I’d say that the show really did try to implement twists to prevent such pagonging like the second Exile Island and the Firemaking twist, although most of them didn’t had the intended outcome. They have not overabused idols or advantages and kinda let them play on their own. Pagongings are fair game as boring as they might be, and believe me there has been no rooting for Moana in my house, but it is what it is.

On the other hand, WAW has being absolutely awful to watch. By far the worst boot order ever in the history of reality TV (TAR, BB, any international survivor). The edit always blindsides me everytime for all the wrong reasons, because the stories they tell for the players don’t make sense and someone you hadn’t seen in a while leaves and you get the picture next episode on the edge. They have strayed so far from the formula it doesn’t even feel like Survivor in the sense that the abilities that made survivor (adaptability, social strategy, numbers) play second-field to idol-hunting and advantage maneuvering. It is kinda like watching a youtube 30 minute recap of a 90 minute episode with a 15 minute ad of Edge of Extinction."
688,2020-03-20 03:16:26,fljs0c,Winners at war feels like reading the synopsis of an episode rather seeing the episode itself. I’m still enjoying it because of the cast but the show is so condensed and formulaic at this point.
689,2020-03-20 00:39:08,fljs0c,"Really do agree, as much as the edit has made David overbearing I would like to see David on the US edition, he's the best player we have comfortably and would be interesting to see the two different games clash."
690,2020-03-20 00:22:55,fljs0c,The music in australian survivor is heaps better...
691,2020-03-20 00:10:23,fljs0c,"I think this all stems down to the producers. US Survivor has producers who all have like 20+ season experience and knowledge of developing the show. AU Survivor has pretty naive and inexperienced producers for the show, and I think it appears pretty easily in the current edit. Dramatic music, exaggerated promo ads, the reliance on purely physical challenges. US Survivor gets me so much more excited than AU has ever made me. Especially last night's episode of WAW. It's the reason I love US survivor so much more."
692,2020-03-19 23:29:16,fljs0c,I disagree. I like AUS Survivor All Stars more. The challenges were so brutal and everyone's a great character. Truly had me dying of suspense on the votes too.
693,2020-03-20 19:56:35,fljs0c,"> Though I have enjoyed previous Australian seasons more than the recent US seasons, I have difficulty recalling a time where I have been more into the US season than the Australian version. Until now.

100% agree. I rant and rave to everyone about how good Australian Survivor has consistently been until this season. I started waning a bit last season with me calling the winner from episode 1 and then some of the pre-merge girls getting little to no airtime was terrible.

But this season, it's somehow worse. The same people are getting the airtime every episode, saying the same repetitive things while others aren't getting any airtime at all. I'll give Australia major points for unique challenges and making attempts at new twists but my interest dropped massively right before merge after losing both Phoebe and Nick. David's running a masterful game and it makes for boring as TV as he enacts revenge and everyone else follows along.

I still think the last 5 years of Australian Survivor is better than the last 5 years of US Survivor, with a few exceptions (Kaoh Rong, DvG). Some of the Australian Survivors have easily become some of my favorites of all time (Phoebe, Brooke, Harry, Shonee for example) so I don't think casting is a problem but the downward feeling towards Australian Survivor this and last season feel like a good thing slipping away."
694,2020-03-25 19:30:20,fljs0c,It's the cast. WaW is a fantastic cast but AUS had a few duds that went far. Plus David's edit has overshadowed some of the other good cast members.
695,2020-03-20 12:10:10,fljs0c,"I think this is part of the problem people keep talking about.  It's the David show, which is fine, he's the one playing for the camera and he's positioned himself really well to coast along to the end, but he's at a stage where what that's his play, to coast to the final challenges and then... well win (maybe his teammates are stupid enough to take him to the end, but I doubt it) the competitions. 

It's probably going to get more entertaining now that it's down to just a few though, since the final few moves are going to need to come out.  There's no alliance battles left to have."
696,2020-03-25 19:31:28,fljs0c,And not having a thousand advantages every episode
697,2020-03-24 04:23:58,fljs0c,"I disagree. The longer eps should be helpful but I don't think they're using this time anywhere near as well as they could. More players is only good idea they actually show those players, but they've just been showing the same people saying the same things ad neasuem"
698,2020-03-20 01:06:44,fljs0c,"I'm in this boat. Our editors are doing a shithouse job at balancing the show, but I'll still take it over the American version every day of the week."
699,2020-03-20 02:17:43,fljs0c,I only say positive things about this season and I get downvoted. The Reddit Survivor community is rabid.

704,2020-03-19 22:29:54,flj2m3,Uhh... she didn’t try to scam Denise. She told Denise she was writing her name down so that their alliance together would stay secret.

707,2020-03-19 22:52:57,flj2m3,"Yeah because she thought she had it all figured out so she’d be getting two fire tokens, using Denise to get out Tony (who she did not trust) and keeping herself good with the tribe as well as Denise. Her intentions were totally self serving and that’s fine it’s Survivor but she thought she was the puppet master and she was the puppet. It’s a scam if you make the person think you’re helping them when in reality you’re only really helping yourself. She would have voted Denise out next week in a heartbeat. Denise’s game play was masterful and seeing Sandra on the other side of it just made it sweeter."

717,2020-03-19 04:20:49,fl3nxp,I’m so proud of Denise. We were all cheering when the blindside went down. I just thought about the condescending speech that Sandra gave to Denise informing her of her demise. I adore how Denise kept a poker face and appeared humble only to send Sandra on her way at tribal like a boss. Adios Sandra :)
718,2020-03-19 05:41:27,fl3nxp,I guess Jeff himself didn’t expect that Denise will be the one to overthrow Sandra.

732,2020-03-14 12:13:22,fig8bj,"Honestly I think the female characters just get better storylines. Like look at April's crisis of faith vs Jackson finding faith.

April's storyline was emotional and gut wrenching. I'm an atheist but even I felt for her with Koracik and the Rabbi when she opened up. But Jackson ... went camping. And that's it. They could have done so much more, they just didn't."
733,2020-03-14 19:53:48,fig8bj,[deleted]
734,2020-03-14 12:49:01,fig8bj,"I think that the female characters have always had the 'biggest' part on storylines than the male characters so is hard to be objetive in that case about the acting.

Saying that though, I do agree that Isaiah (his mess apart) was probably the best of them so far IMO and Jesse to me is the weakest out of all."
735,2020-03-14 14:41:11,fig8bj,"Kevin Mckidd is a fantastic actor, his character just really sucks and doesn't allow him to demonstrate his talent (except for when he was suffering with PTSD when he was first introduced to the show)"
736,2020-03-14 12:35:07,fig8bj,"I was about to say the same. The actresses get much better storylines where they can show their acting chops. They guys are there to move the actresses’ storylines along and more just like there to be props usually and look pretty. I think when they are given the storylines they can definitely bring it, it’s just they rarely get a storyline that is about them 
Also I actually thought Washington was overrated. He overacts in my opinion."

Sophie, 2. Tony, 3. Yul contender rankers, though I'd put Tyson over Natalie as the favorite to return at the merge.

Out of curiosity, what is the rationale for Sophie's tone?  She and Sarah were the clear protagonists of that tribe, but I don't know if I saw enough editorial manipulation for P tone."
753,2020-03-14 16:27:30,fie48w,You honestly do these the best
754,2020-03-14 17:18:53,fie48w,Sooooo glad Wendell is out of the running. Bichele’s roasting was on point
755,2020-03-14 22:41:31,fie48w,"Considering you gave Nick MOR instead of OTT because his awkward scene pales in comparison to the Wenchele scene, Wendell is definitely OTTN. Michele piled on him in confessional and he didn't have anything to say about it besides some insignificant nonsense. He was painted as an awful person without being able to justify himself. That's OTTN. Great writeup as always though, can't wait for next week."
756,2020-03-16 14:53:10,fie48w,"The one thing we didn’t see from Yul which I think is a major point to him not wining is that he talked about awareness for ALS but he never said he was donating the winnings on camera which, if he said it, they would surely show so they had the winner clip of him saying it for the finale.  

The fact they didn’t show it makes me think he’s not winning.

That mixed with the fact he just donated 50k in the last couple of weeks makes me think he isn’t planning on having $2mil to donate in the next few weeks"
757,2020-03-14 18:24:36,fie48w,I actually saw Wendell as OTTN and Adam + Ben as MOR4.
758,2020-03-14 17:20:37,fie48w,"I was heavily considering putting Tyson as my #1 Edge returnee, and probably will after actually seeing him on my screen next week.

759,2020-03-14 18:59:09,fie48w,Why do people not like Wendell? He seems so likable to me but I'm also a stan. I'm sad this episode shot him down as my winner pick. Think it really helped Michelle though who I almost went with.
760,2020-03-15 04:34:04,fie48w,"That’s a very fair rebuttal, Edgic is certainly a process and sometimes as viewers we have different takeaways! Thanks for the kind words though :)"
761,2020-03-14 20:41:47,fie48w,"Wendell could swing between OTT and MOR but given his stoic personality, I had a hard time seeing him as an OTT caricature. He definitely looked bad, but N tone was enough to convey that. I think Adam and Ben were both overshadowed by the girls + Rob so they weren’t that visible in my opinion."
762,2020-03-14 18:03:26,fie48w,"Thanks, makes sense on Sophie.  For EOE, there’s so much evidence for both of them that no one will look foolish predicting either one."
763,2020-03-14 19:14:47,fie48w,I think it’s his cockiness that completely turns me off to him...and the fact that he always has that stupid thing in his mouth. He’s just trying too hard
764,2020-03-14 05:36:05,fictzk,"I believe you’ll stay with it because you can’t resist the urge to keep on watching, much like all of us. Although in my opinion it does not get any better, it only gets worse. I would recommend stopping after season 11, if it was only Sandra Oh keeping you"

766,2020-03-14 08:55:03,fictzk,"Not as good as when Cristina was on. She was the show 

S11 was alright and so was s12. S13 was awful, but s14 was surprisingly good. S15 is a hit or miss, but a couple of characters and one or two couples make it worth it. Plus one of the best episodes they have. First half of s16 was good, but second half makes it the worst season ever"
767,2020-03-14 05:31:02,fictzk,"no it will never get as good as it was, but it allows you to get to know the other characters and understand the history of their past"

That's what I did.

Imo season 11 is very well written but to enjoy it you need to accept that Cristina is gone and show has different dynamic now."

772,2020-03-14 17:28:12,fictzk,"I like a lot of the other new characters, but something just feels off. Idk if it’s the writing or the directing or what. The delicious greys anatomy tension feels gone and is replaced by a sort of melodrama that I’m not keen on."

777,2020-03-10 23:37:25,fgjuan,"It makes more sense with Cristina.  She had a very privileged life and for the most part she always felt secure and in control. After the shooting her reality was shattered creating PTSD.

As for Meredith, she had an emotionally abusive mother, absent father, she drowned, she almost died in a bomb explosion.  So her character somewhat chronically experiences traumas and she is more stoic in reaction."
778,2020-03-10 21:08:36,fgjuan,"Meredith has kind of been like that since the start so I guess there wasn't any of those changes just because they may have thought Ellen couldn't top it or not.

Is also kind of talked how the hell she keeps moving foward with everything that has happened and her POV about it during all of the seasons."
779,2020-03-10 19:57:53,fgjuan,"Well
She saw her mother's attempt of Suicide. Her father seperation.

780,2020-03-10 09:45:25,fgbasa,Thinking about seeing if dmt would also like to narrate this one if thats alright.
781,2020-03-10 17:52:45,fgbasa,"This is a great story! And hey, by all means. DMT is awesome and we've done many of the same stories in the past anyway :D It's your story. What you do with it is totally your call!"
782,2020-03-10 18:27:04,fgbasa,"ty, feel free to edit or change any of the stories i make to your liking. just so long as the humans never look strong. working on part two of the overall's slaughter slowly but surely. maybe do like three parts all together and put it in a Halloween special. or maybe not. idk. chow!\~"
783,2020-03-09 18:31:26,ffz6ao,"I think Chris D and Natalie A could qualify as villains but I wouldn't think it's a big deal for them to be on either tribe. Vecepia and Cochran I definitely think would be heroes. Adam would be a hero because of the story of his mom. Ben's a war hero and was literally on the heroes tribe on HHH, he would be a hero. 

Chris U, Jenna, Aras, Natalie W are so neutral that it almost doesn't feel right to call them heroes or villains."
784,2020-03-09 18:33:36,ffz6ao,Ben as a villain? Lol what
785,2020-03-09 20:34:59,ffz6ao,This does look accurate. But I would swap Nick and Adam
786,2020-03-09 20:45:32,ffz6ao,"Heroes: Tina, Ethan, Vecepia, Jenna, Amber, Tom, Danni, Aras, Yul, Earl, Bob, JT, Natalie W, Fabio, Kim, Denise, Mike, Jeremy, Michele, Adam, Ben, Wendell, Nick, Chris U, Tommy

Villains: Richard, Brian, Sandra, Chris D, Todd, Parvati, Rob, Sophie, Cochran, Tyson, Tony, Natalie A, Sarah"
787,2020-03-09 22:44:17,ffz6ao,"Absolutely swap the two Natalie’s, but that’s my only major complaint."
788,2020-03-09 18:52:42,ffz6ao,Ben's definitely a hero.
789,2020-03-09 18:34:40,ffz6ao,"Natalie w., and Adam are Heroes"
790,2020-03-09 19:27:22,ffz6ao,"I think you're really reaching to find villains here. Maybe my favorite thing about this season is that there aren't any angry, bitter people on this cast. It's still plenty cutthroat, perhaps even more so than normal, but these players know that you don't have to be an ass about it."
791,2020-03-09 00:59:10,ffmdea,"Those were the rumors in the beginning of the season. I’m 99% sure this is no longer happening.

But if it does, it’ll be Addison. That would def save this season but hopefully she doesn’t stay too long because I don’t want Krista to ruin her happiness."
792,2020-03-09 04:41:44,ffmdea,I'd be so happy to see a familiar face that isn't whatever they've done to Teddy
793,2020-03-09 01:00:04,ffmdea,Why do you think Krista would ruin her happiness??
794,2020-03-09 01:02:48,ffmdea,"Well Addison’s ending on PP was perfect. She grew and got everything she wanted in life. Most importantly, it wasn’t cheap drama and her ending was earned.

But Krista’s writers seem to love cheap drama so if Addison stays longer than one episode, I’m sure she’ll have Addison cheat on Jake or maybe have Jake leave her for some other reason. I just want Addison to remain happy and I don’t trust Krista."
795,2020-03-09 01:15:15,ffmdea,Do you think there’s any bad blood between Krista and Sarah Drew and Jessica Capshaw
796,2020-03-09 04:42:34,ffmdea,They seemed kind of blind sided in interviews and Instagram posts right after so I'd say yes lol
797,2020-03-09 13:30:46,ffmdea,"they got fired 3 days before international womens day for two new male characters on the cast, they have the right to be pissed. 😔🤙"
798,2020-03-08 05:47:33,ff7km6,"100% agree with you, this is so uncharacteristic of everyone involved, actors as well as characters. Every other character had a beautiful tribute send-off that commemorated the best in them and the cast usually writes something about how much they loved working with that actor and the years of friendship and yada yada yada. This whole sendoff feels like it was sewn together. 

They could have written him off in a way that paid homage to him as they did with Christina... OR his mom, OR he could've gone to war for a while like April or something. IDK 

But I don't think its coincidence that out of all send offs, it involves Izzie Stevens!? I realize Alex and Izzie had history but Izzie's farewell was also not kind due to her actresses real life behavior / drama. The exact same thing happened to Burke's character / actor. Alex's send off is douchebaggy and pays homage to the immature kid he was in the beginning of the series, not the man who valued his relationship with Jo and gave her his last name. He knows about her abandonment issues and he left her because no one's ever heard of co-parenting??? 

TBH, I think the writers had him join Izzie in their ""F you"" universe."
799,2020-03-08 04:47:54,ff7km6,"She posted a goodbye on her instagram on Thursday.

Edit: you’re right. Just realized she says Karev not Justin."
800,2020-03-08 05:06:49,ff7km6,"I see your point but also, which will trend more, #FarewelltoAlex or #FarewelltoJustinChambers?

Also, the latter would cause me to think JC died, especially since there have been statements about his mental health. Every time I see a celeb trend, my mind instantly goes there."
801,2020-03-08 07:02:00,ff7km6,You don't just leave a show suddenly without some kind of reprecussions...he definitely pissed some people off..we probably don't know the real reason he left...
802,2020-03-08 06:41:18,ff7km6,"I think they did what was best with what they had and what they needed/wanted.

Idk if Justin did something to piss them off because if he had I doubt they would had actually took the time to do a 'farewell' and give Alex a somewhat 'happy ending' (I know is unpopular but it was). Everyone has always talked about how much they loved Justin and how he was the best of the best so I for one just think that they had their good-byes privated and that there isn't really a point for posting stuff in social media if he isn't going to see it or if he maybe didn't want it. Now that you mention T.R he is tight not only with Justin but also his children and wife so if something fishy went down I hardly doubt he was going to be liking that post as he did or chilling with Ellen."
803,2020-03-08 04:41:40,ff7km6,On point with this observation.
804,2020-03-08 23:54:35,ff7km6,"I agree that something happened. But I think that something was him up and quitting and saying he would not return at all. He really f*cked them all over by doing that. Think about the shitstorm that has been kicked up and how it reinforced the pitchforks for the show to end. We know that ALL 4 original cast members made a pact to stay until the show ended. And he broke that. In doing so, he put their jobs in jeopardy, especially Camilla's, and shunned the audience. Even though it is his life and his choice, what he did was pretty messed up. Initially I thought maybe he was fired but since NOONE is saying anything about missing Justin- I think they are angry with him. And the picture and caption with T.R. is a totally passive e aggressive message too. Although I did chuckle imagining Ellen asking T.R. if he'd talked to Katie yet and what did she think. Lol."
805,2020-03-08 09:58:06,ff7km6,"I thought the same thing. I had a look through their Instagrams and saw nothing, no goodbye to Justin. Something went down"
806,2020-03-08 05:00:47,ff7km6,I will say this... I don’t agree with what they did with his character. I think he’s evolved so much further than to just up and leave Jo the way he did. But perhaps Ellen is mad at him?  He did technically just up and leave in the middle of the season that he had originally signed up for.
807,2020-03-08 05:53:52,ff7km6,"YES. THIS!! Thank you for understanding my thought process here and adding insight. I co-sign everything you said. We were brain washed to dislike Izzie at the end as she became problematic for the show. So, for a much loved character to be sent off to her after 7 years of Jolex is certainly them sending a message. Message received Krista, but now we wanna know WHY."
808,2020-03-08 04:49:51,ff7km6,Go back and read it again. She says goodbye to Alex and tags other people from the show NOT Justin.
809,2020-03-08 04:52:45,ff7km6,Was the goodbye to Alex or Justin?
810,2020-03-08 05:09:24,ff7km6,"That's not what I'm getting at. Yes, absolutely Farewell to Alex. But, after the show aired or when he announced it, no one posted a photo of themselves w him to say how great of a friend he is, or how they'll miss working w him etc. I'm reading between the lines which you often have to do when it comes to Grey's."
811,2020-03-08 13:20:05,ff7km6,Didnt Justin Chambers day something about the work  environment was crap?
812,2020-03-09 00:24:25,ff7km6,"That's what I'm leaning towards as well. I guess we'll find out eventually what happened, but in the meantime I wonder what would've made him up and quit like that after all these years."
813,2020-03-08 05:15:48,ff7km6,"""Ellen is mad at him""? Now that would be out of character for her, especially how supportive she's been of his recovery.

However, considering the garbage a lot of the season has been, I blame Krista."
814,2020-03-08 05:03:57,ff7km6,"Yes, something is definitely not right. I'm thinking maybe it was a reverse Patrick Dempsey situation where Justin wanted to make as much as Ellen. Or get producer credits. And it would've been well deserved, but maybe they refused? I mean...they couldn't even get him to film his last episode. It's bizarre to say the least."
815,2020-03-08 06:05:34,ff7km6,"It was also completely insensitive to his character and it makes me really resent the show. I LOVED Alex. He became my favorite through his journey and his love, patience and pursuit of Jo. I felt like they were so great together... now when I think back on the show I'll remember that Alex abandoned Jo. I know some people will say ""no he needed to be there for his kids"" and while that can be true, there is no reason he couldn't have been there for his kids AND kept his marriage. But to me, he also emotionally cheated on Joe and left their marriage without even so much as discussing anything with her the moment he began contact with Izzie and didn't tell his freaking wife. He basically told Jo ""you're not good enough to join my new life with my kids and I don't want to have to co-parent with Izzie and you, just Izzie"". Its disgusting given what Jo's endured, I mean can our girl catch a freaking break??

I'm dying to know their real motive for writing him off... I don't think its simply lack of creative options or shitty writing because we know they can come up with the most heart wrenching and beautiful endings and this just felt wrong. Something is definitely up, thank you for sharing your thoughts, I 100% agree and am glad I'm not alone!"
816,2020-03-08 04:50:11,ff7km6,Just posted an edit with the same.
817,2020-03-08 04:54:00,ff7km6,Alex
818,2020-03-08 05:13:02,ff7km6,"I gotcha. Maybe they were all blindsided by his departure and didn’t get any final pics with him, and will post past pics after an appropriate time of grieving has happened? IDK... interesting quandary."
819,2020-03-08 13:26:52,ff7km6,"Never, he has always been appreciative and grateful to Grey's even after his exit."
820,2020-03-09 02:03:04,ff7km6,"Yeah, I agree. Especially with the end of the show in sight.  And let's be real- the show is only going to keep going another season or two at the most. I don't see how that really would make a huge difference for his career at this point. And there were conflicting messages on why he left too. Initially it seemed like it was about his mental health but then his statement mentioned wanting to diversify in his career and he was already booked on his next gig. So a little confusing. Now, I would believe that he could have been angry with the writers for not giving him much airtime but there is definitely more to this story than we know."
821,2020-03-08 05:17:06,ff7km6,You missed the “perhaps” in there. It’s just conjecture based on the fact that he left in the middle of the season.
822,2020-03-08 05:19:46,ff7km6,"This was not a money issue, JC has been really open about his mental issues. In fact, he's already in a treatment facility now... So, seems like that reason he couldn't film.

IDK ""saving my life for my kids"" or ""one more episode of Grey's in an already janky season""? 🤔"
823,2020-03-08 05:14:49,ff7km6,"Yes, which fits w my theory that there's more to this story. I follow Camilla on Instagram and she used to often post photos of her and Justin and it's been crickets lately. So, it sent up a red flag for me."
824,2020-03-09 02:17:04,ff7km6,"Exactly. The show is only contracted for one more season so far, so I agree, you already put in 16, just get to the finish line. I'm convinced no one saw this coming and hopefully we'll find out what really happened sooner rather than later."
825,2020-03-08 05:24:33,ff7km6,"His statement reads ""I am addressing mental health issues"", plus, this isn't the first time he's been vocal about it. I bet he realized his wife and kids needed him well more than the show."
826,2020-03-09 02:19:38,ff7km6,"Yeah exactly, me too."
827,2020-03-08 05:39:08,ff7km6,"No it doesn't.  This is his official statement:

 “There’s no good time to say goodbye to a show and character that’s defined so much of my life for the past 15 years. For some time now, however, I have hoped to diversify my acting roles and career choices. And, as I turn 50 and am blessed with my remarkable, supportive wife and five wonderful children, now is that time.” “As I move on from 'Grey’s Anatomy,' I want to thank the ABC family, Shonda Rhimes, original cast members Ellen Pompeo, Chandra Wilson and James Pickens, and the rest of the amazing cast and crew, both past and present, and, of course, the fans for an extraordinary ride.”"
828,2020-03-08 05:45:05,ff7km6,"Oh, the publicist statement? FYI he's back at Privé-Swiss tonight."
829,2020-03-08 05:45:45,ff7km6,According to? Are you his PA?
830,2020-03-08 05:50:10,ff7km6,"Ha! His production assistant? Nope. Not his assistant either, if that's what you meant. 

My family is from Westbrook. When there's a celeb in town, paparazzo abound."
831,2020-03-07 17:08:31,fexnqd,"I always find it funny that when ALL of these stories go down the guy bends the girl down with her ass in the air 

I feel as though people are watching too much porn

FFS doesn't anyone do anything besides fuck in the ass or pussy from behind?"
832,2020-03-07 17:03:18,fexnqd,That's awesome bro
833,2020-03-07 17:43:09,fexnqd,"Yes. But bent over in some form is a comfortable way to play, usually for both parties. Regardless of fitness, or dick size. Its also seen as somewhat submissive, without being overly intimate, so it strikes a nice balance for what this sub is usually about. Casual hookups"
834,2020-03-07 05:02:03,feqeta," This is a long one, but there was a whole lot of ground to cover!

Rachel takes the throne after Saint Dinah... and Penthesil is about to realize that not every successor is as well mannered as the predecessor.  

Rachel discovers her mother was right, she did have a child... luckily Tasha gets a little help from a local Penthesil resident for the birth of the wee princess... But is she so wee?  And what is this power within her? 

Tasha raises the sisters as best she can... but a vision comes to her!  Timothy's on earth?!

Time to track him down...

835,2020-03-07 06:23:54,feqeta,ngl this series in particular is answering so many questions and I'm drinkng it all up like water
836,2020-03-07 07:28:35,feqeta,"Throughout all the horror that is them, I believe  that Ragna and Rachel are a love that will be their redemption.  Zeph is a manifestation of that love, with the duality that BOTH of their personalities personify.  I understand that their actions are seen from the ""greater good "" aspect. And that is what truly makes this a horror story. Both sides we can see the good and bad. Both sides we can see unconditional love, and how that can be used for the downfall of us all. It is the same sides of a coin. It is truly poignant."
837,2020-03-07 07:35:48,feqeta,"Do Ragna was the product of Lord Hades and Persephone...did not know Lucy could be so sensitive, even with the short visions we have received.  Makes sense now, especially if she fled from him,  why he is so bitter toward romantic love considering how he views his familiar connections."
838,2020-03-07 16:20:52,feqeta,I love Tashas story we’ve found out so much and I just love it

856,2020-03-06 00:58:36,fe5ek9,Passive play is very often correct in the early to mid stages of survivor. It's remarkable that the gameplay is sometimes as wild as it was in the IoTI pre merge in many ways.
857,2020-03-06 01:00:49,fe5ek9,Older survivor promoted passive play for the whole game
858,2020-03-06 01:03:03,fe5ek9,"There is SO much I disagree with in this post, but in truth I’m not sure you’re looking for opposing opinions to see the other side so I’ll just wish you luck and say you are entitled to whatever opinion you feel!"
859,2020-03-06 01:00:55,fe5ek9,I don't think this tracks with most of the recent winners. Since fire making people could be more indelicate and still win.
860,2020-03-06 01:04:19,fe5ek9,"If someones playing aggressively to the point of being voted out, that's bad gameplay. 

Sandra is actually playing a really great game, notice the target wasnt on her (the ONLY two time winner in a season of all winners). As for sitting out of challenges, who else should be sitting out then? It's not laziness its strategy"
861,2020-03-06 03:16:28,fe5ek9,Well I mean the vote that just happened might have ended up a big move had it not been for the formulaic tribe swap which contestants know about.
862,2020-03-06 00:56:45,fe5ek9,Ok casual
863,2020-03-06 01:12:54,fe5ek9,No. Its more like the boring game wins you Survivor (As well as BB)
864,2020-03-06 04:59:37,fe5ek9,The big moves just to make big moves drives me crazy. I’d rather see someone playing UTR and making a well timed move than someone building a resume.
865,2020-03-06 01:55:38,fe5ek9,Haha. True that! 💪🏻💅🏿
866,2020-03-23 20:01:53,fe5ek9,"  Yes you are correct.. A very passive, coasting style is the best way to play BB and Survivor . You just can't play aggressively be ause you then hurt people's feelings thus losing their final vote"
867,2020-03-06 05:17:46,fe5ek9,I suspect future seasons will be strongly influenced by this one. Big Moves might be just a phase we went through before the winners showed us all what actually wins.
868,2020-03-06 05:19:05,fe5ek9,Fingers crossed!

875,2020-04-19 12:39:29,g3zofm,"Excellent story told with excellence. 
Very enjoyable.
Some minor comments:
The use of Roman taking another step up to Dante’s face again and again does not work when Roman stepped to Dante’s face when he entered.  Go  to have space on the stage for the movements you describe your actors. Certainly not as strict as a play or movie written.  Still, you cannot forget space.  Just increase the tension by voice, by actions, by making a fist and hitting his hand among a multitude of others.  Throughout this, Dante is motionless.  If you think Dante would back down to Roman, just have take a step back and then there is room for Roman’s step up. But i don’t think Dante would back down.

I can’t decide if the protagonist is trapped by her submissive actions to Bles, and being a dominant person, she seeks to fulfill her need to dominate to men who can’t be dominated.

It’s not sex. She is fully satisfied heading to the shower.

884,2020-04-18 18:01:30,g3qkbt,I'm so with you there. It's just so lame like the character is off the show just deal with it. It's just as terrible as replacing a character with a new actor.

891,2020-04-17 21:19:08,g39tnz,"Wow, good finds! I agree with everything except Villanelle’s kill. That scene was meant to mirror perfectionism. She killed that woman in a style similar to Dasha’s. But where Dasha is brash and emotional, Villanelle showed restraint and calculation (aka I’m better syndrome). Covering the victim with powder was meant to tie that together I think.

As for Carolyn taking Vil under her wing...we’ll there’s a popular theory that Konstantin and Carolyn are Vil’s parents. Can you imagine if that turns out to be true? 😮"
892,2020-04-18 02:10:56,g39tnz,"Nicely written. Great analysis. V is off - she didn't finish off the store keeper - didn't check and look into her eyes. Something else is on her mind - why did she fix on the picture? Was it to ingratiate herself and put her target off guard? Maybe? We've seen her do similar sorts of things or is she interested in the parentage? 

Konstantin seems to be the representative of how a rational person tries to make the best of a totally irrational situation and life. He plays the espionage and assassination game well but doesn't seem to derive any pleasure out of it. We see that he isn't like Raymond or Anton. 

I used to think K had some paternal feelings toward V after the episode in S1 with Irina and hearing that he used a lot of the same teaching phrases with V as he used with his daughter. He uses her because he has to in S2 to save himself and his family but gives her the car and gun to try to get away. Was it part of the original plan with Carolyn? Would the police been tipped off to look for the car and arrest her or get her killed? Or does he sort of pity her and so tried to give her a way out?

V's running away with E may have actually saved them both because maybe the car escape was a set-up. We don't know what Eve told the investigators but it appears any effort so far to hang the mess on her didn't take."
893,2020-04-19 08:32:57,g39tnz,"I definitely agree with everyone that the wedding scene was bizarre, the speech- in particular- was very cringy. The audience aren’t used to feeling this uncomfortable when Villanelle is on screen, we are used to feeling assured and confident. I mean psychopaths are usually incredibly charismatic, and we know Villanelle to be no exception. In theory a wedding speech should be another easy, false-charm, paint-by-numbers sort of affair for her but instead it was extremely clumsy and awkward. This was not the only odd behaviour she exhibited. 

A lot of people have expressed the view that as a character in general, Villanelle just feels a bit ‘off’. I think I have come up with a fairly reasonable explanation, however, just to come to Jodie and the writers’ defence. 

Villanelle is desperately trying to fulfil her definition of ‘normal’. I think the realisation that she was used as a pawn by MI6 and the twelve; of Konstantin’s betrayal; and of Eve’s rejection- brought her to some kind of break in her psychopathology. Psychopaths are usually fairly emotionally vacant and live for the moment, which explains why V never cared before about who she worked for and why she was killing people- she just lived for the kills. The understanding of a betrayal by her father figure, and the manipulation by higher powers would have been highly unnerving for her; but I think Eve’s rejection was the straw that broke the camels back. 

Villanelle wanted/expected Eve to run away with her, she believed they were the same. Her subsequent abandonment ruptured this belief. I genuinely think this must be the first time Villanelle has ever had to acknowledge, in some form, the trauma that has permeated her entire existence. Based on what we know and what’s in the books, Villanelle has essentially spent most of her life having her mental disorder weaponised for someone else’s agenda, at her expense of course (see: ‘I feel nothing’ speech 2:6) Regardless of how she sees it or justifies it, that is the truth. She must know this in the back of her mind or she wouldn’t be trying to rebel against it. She is trying to ignore the very thing that makes her an asset to the twelve: her pathological instinct to kill. She is trying to be truthful, to be empathic, to be ‘normal’. If you think about it, the fact that she managed to ignore her murderous inclinations for six months and follow through with the whole wedding thing was actually quite an incredible feat for someone as far up the Hare Psychopothy Scale as her (supposedly). 

I think the reason the wedding scene and the speech felt so ‘off’ was because Villanelle was actively trying not to manipulate the situation. If it had been an act as part of a job- with the means to an end being a kill- I’m sure she would have been as smooth and as quick-witted as ever. I actually feel quite sorry for her, I mean she tried SO hard- but her resolve to flippantly throw all of it away and return to her preferred lifestyle (and being under the thumb of the twelve) was inevitable in my opinion, it was just a case of when."
894,2020-04-18 12:55:05,g39tnz,"I didn't hate it the first time but I did like it more with a couple of rewatches.

I also found this Eve reminiscent of the s1 version. I hope it remains."
895,2020-04-18 11:42:28,g39tnz,"I did not care for the wedding sequence. It was gratuitous and didn’t add anything. I would have prefer to see the relationship when it started, as Maria tells the story, of V in the airport. Then we could have seen something before the wedding scene. 

I also did not care for Jodie’s interpretation & acting of that scene. When V lunges at D it seems very forced and unnecessary as they end up in the car together anyway."
896,2020-04-18 14:02:02,g39tnz,"I think it'd make sense that V would team up with Carolyn. I've had a guess that Carolyn is a keeper or higher, training and recruiting eve for the 12, but I've also thought that might be too simple. If Carolyn is not a double, here's where I see a VC team up potential:

I think the wedding reveals a lot about where V is as a character but I have to back up first. As far as I can tell Aaron was her first adult relationship in which she even had the thought 'I can't kill this person' before speaking to them. I say can't as a indicator of will not physical reality. Now we all know she didn't take that as absolute truth. She was always going to kill him and the plot was always going to go to a place where that was justified. But during her ""do you get lonely"" convo with him, I think she started to understand that she is more complex than a typical psychopath. 

This was hinted at when Konstanine's daughter spoke on her underlying sadness and called her a good person - probably not something she's heard regularly in her life and maybe not even a possibility that has been spoken to her aside from Anna. The end of her future with Anna may have led her to give up on her positive potential and an acceptance of the labels that would have showered her in the legal process. She adopted the titles given to her because they gave her a control that being a loving normal person did not. 

In the videos she finds that Aaron is more detached from his kills. I think she recognized a difference in them and maybe expanded her understanding of herself and her possibilities for development.  He's a psychopath for fulfillment - shes willing to do psychopathic things for survival (maybe she wasn't lying during her first dinner with wet-cat Eve). This is why she was willing to play a non-murderous long con with a very boring looking woman. Instead of wanting to kill the pain away, she found someone to watch movies with - even if it was a cheap replacement for the people she misses.  What she doesn't realize yet is that people aren't interchangeable and you have to accept them for what they share with you. It's also revealing that she hasn't been killing folks as far as we can tell. Does that mean she's not really into killing as a hobby but instead ""just a job"" that she had to take to survive? Anyone with a crappy job knows that you can grow to enjoy it if you're comfortably compensated, have cool coworkers, and do it long enough.

Back to V and C. It would make sense for V to go to C for a redemption path. Especially if the 12 piss her off or reject her too many times. But I think she's going to meet some family and find out her life could have gone a different direction catalyzing her in a different direction this adopting Carolyn's good psychopathy.  Whether or not Eve remains on the good psychopath side is up in the air."
897,2020-04-18 08:23:28,g39tnz,What are your thoughts on the wedding at the beginning?
898,2020-04-17 23:51:24,g39tnz,Nah that can’t be possible because she said her father was a drunk meaning she would remember what he looked like but the Carolyn part could be true who knows
899,2020-04-18 02:55:59,g39tnz,"Hello, thank you! 
I know it was meant to mirror Dasha but nothing about that scene was revealing, or exciting for me, and Villanelle seemed ooc - and Jodie's expressions were too extra towards the end. But am glad people liked it! 

I don't think V is related to either Konstantin or Carolyn - I know that was a possible theory during S1, but I somehow can't buy into it."
900,2020-04-18 03:32:48,g39tnz,I completely think you’re right about them possibly being her parents.  More than likely there’s a greater possibility that Konstantin is a relative. I am not sure if it’s her father or not. I  wonder if V would feel any different about her comments about them never sleeping together 😂
901,2020-04-18 13:14:44,g39tnz,"Yeah, excited about the second episode. Let's just hope it's cut better so it's as appealing in the first go. (But maybe with KE at this stage it's almost impossible for them to meet expectations)"
902,2020-04-18 14:30:29,g39tnz,Yeah! The wedding speech was very cringy too - a psychopath of all people would know how to please a crowd
903,2020-04-18 14:25:43,g39tnz,"I agree that the point of introducing Aaron into the story, was to highlight the spectrum and complexity in psychopathy for all the stakeholders - Eve (who was listening in), Villanelle, and the audience. So, it was a counterfactual to Martin's rather simplistic interpretation which he gave during the fake presentation. 

That being said, I don't think the show will try to redeem Villanelle (emotionally). They'll show that there is complexity there, in that she can sustain a deeply personal obsession that has some truth of emotion to it - but, I doubt they will go down the road of complete redemption vis-a-vis her general attitude towards murder, death, and destruction. It's a significantly bigger gambit for them to turn her good, than to continue to push Eve to the darker side. 

If it were to happen, I imagine that Carolyn will groom her, not to redeem her, but to use Vs lack of morality for the greater good. Given how they both have such a transactional view of the world, V won't have Eve's delusions of ""saving the world"" - but, she could be trained to work as an asset for the MI6 (not in the way S2 executed it though). It would excite Villanelle too, who is all about wanting to be in the middle of high power shenanigans."
904,2020-04-18 08:44:29,g39tnz,"I like the idea - I can imagine Villanelle wanting to prove to herself and dead!Eve that she can love, and she can be normal, and that she doesn't need Eve. And of course she does it in the most extra way possible. By deciding to get married - but as is clear, not only is she completely disinterested in her wife, she also considers these social constructs such as marriages no big deal. She left it behind with zero fucks to give, because thats how little that matters to her. It's extra for us, but completely nonchalant for her. I don't know how self aware she is at this point though - that's never really clear with her. How much of her own behaviour does she understand? 

All that being said, it was executed quite poorly, and could have been a much better constructed and laid out scene. I didn't much like Villanelle's speech or Jodie's acting in it. I also found the camera work a bit jarring, and didn't particularly think much of Dashas entry or the ensuing chaos. I mean it wasn't as bad as it sounds, but given the potential there, it quite completely missed the mark."
905,2020-04-18 00:38:02,g39tnz,"True, but it’s also possible the man that raised her was not the biological father. Considering how easy it is for Konstantin to dump his kids but remain close by when they’re in danger, I’d say Villanelle qualifies. 🤷‍♀️"
906,2020-04-18 08:19:38,g39tnz,"She also mentioned her mother had “shitty thin hair.” The book details how they’re both dead, her mother before her father but eventually her father. I think the implication in the show is that they both are dead too although it wouldn’t shock me if we were to find out one or both are alive (unless the backstory of her father’s death is the same as it was described in the book - but I guess they could change that. Her revenge was badass though...) I don’t think I’d like the idea of Konstantin and Carolyn being her parents, it just makes everything *too* connected and I’m not sure if I’d like that."
907,2020-04-19 04:46:32,g39tnz,"Ugh, I hope not. I feel like the secretly someone's parent twist is a) overdone and b) rarely done well. Off the top of my head I think that I liked it in Empire Strikes Back and pretty much nowhere else.  It'd just make the world of the show feel too small while all indications are that the current showrunner is trying to build it out (re-focusing on the Twelve, showing factions/division within MI6, etc.)"
908,2020-04-18 13:19:26,g39tnz,I think the fan base is pretty loyal so they have some leeway. The slow building stuff is necessary. I remembered being worried after seeing s2e1 but it quickly subsided. But I also watched that season within 2 days since it was all out at the time. I'm not sure how it'll progress (in my mind) only seeing one ep a week but I'm not too concerned.
909,2020-04-18 13:56:23,g39tnz,"Oh, it makes a huge difference IMO. KE is an imminently binge worthy show because it's all about the mood and the immersion in that world. If I had the patience to do it, I would any day prefer to binge watch."
910,2020-04-18 14:02:35,g39tnz,"I'm interested to see what this new experience is like. Honestly, I barely have any shows that I have to wait on. We've become spoiled lol."
911,2020-04-18 14:08:06,g39tnz,"Yeah same - I actually really enjoy the fandom aspect of it, which can nowadays only sustain itself for a period for weekly shows. That aspect is definitely a lot of fun + the speculation + the anticipation. The adjacent experiences are all worth it. Plus, you always have the option of binge watching it once it's all out."
912,2020-04-18 14:17:50,g39tnz,This is the first season I've been involved with the fandom. I didn't use reddit before the quarantine plus I was worried it would be obnoxious and filled with people shipping Villanelle and Eve (not that I don't) without enough consideration. But I've been pleasantly surprised.
913,2020-04-18 14:39:15,g39tnz,"Yeah, I joined I think after S2E3. And reddit was genuinely fantastic and had some great discussions - and people are mostly extremely respectful and fun."

919,2020-04-14 02:28:41,g0x07t,"I always find it amusing when people want to be convinced to continue watching something. If it’s not for you then it’s not for you; that’s perfectly fine. There is so much great TV out there that no one should have to spend their time suffering through something they just don’t connect with for the sake of watching it. 

Taste is subjective. Subjectively speaking I like the characters enough to overlook some of the flaws in the show, so I keep watching. If that’s not where you are at then cheers and on to something else!"
920,2020-04-14 05:19:55,g0x07t,"For me, the highlights of this show are in the acting and the relationship between V and Eve. It's where this show shines, and I think it's why people love it so much. I really enjoy the plot as well, but honestly I'm mostly in it for the dynamic between Jodie Comer and Sandra Oh. I find their chemistry so enjoyable and it keeps me hooked episode after episode.

If you're trying to examine the plot structure as a way to figure out why people like it so much, you're looking in the wrong places. Like I said, I would love the show regardless of the amazing acting and character dynamic between Eve and V, but those things just put this show in god level tier for me, lol. I think that's what the craze is about. 

If you're looking for a super well-written drama, this show just might not be for you. If you're looking for a show with a GODDESS like Jodie Comer and a character like Villanelle, you won't find it anywhere else. I guess that's my take on it."
921,2020-04-14 17:41:16,g0x07t,"""Seriously-why so many 5 stars?"" Because not everyone likes the same things???? I bet there's at least one series you love, that others don't. Not every series is made for everyone. If that was the case, we wouldn't have the variety we have now, nor the sheer number of series we have now."
922,2020-04-14 22:04:56,g0x07t,"I don’t really disagree with anything you’ve said, to be honest. I love the show for a lot of reasons, but strong writing is not necessarily one of them—it’s more the overall metaphor and the decadence.

I relate to Eve because I think her infatuation with Villanelle is rooted in a deep desire to be like her. Her life is glamorous and beyond the boundaries of society. The lush and colorful production (although I am not really a fan of the filming/production of this premiere compared to the first season) and cool soundtrack, exotic locations, lack of any real consequences for the main characters at the expense of everyone they mow down in pursuit of their own selfish ends, their attractiveness and the element of sexual tension between them, etc, all represent a fantasy.

But then I see over and over that Villanelle never grows or changes because she is a psychopath, a husk of a human with no empathy; and as Eve becomes more and more like her, she becomes less and less likable because that is the reality of the fantasy, but it doesn’t make it any less desirable when compared to the drabness of being “good and average,” represented by the secondary characters: Nico for obvious reasons, Elena’s lack of desire for danger and adventure, Kenny’s morals, etc. I find the metaphor overall very relatable, the performances enjoyable with Villanelle drawing me in and then making me feel guilty every time she reminds me what she is, what I am actually fantasizing about being like. It’s a ride even if it does generally return to the same place every time lol."
923,2020-04-14 03:02:45,g0x07t,"You kinda have to accept that the international assassin organisation plot is only a backdrop for the gay tension (similar to the over-the-top secret org of john wick being a vehicle for sick action scenes). Even season 1 started to stumble a bit once they try to get into the twelve plot. If you think too much about how the twelve actually works it won't make much sense. The entirety of the twelve is to make the look-a-government-agent-is-falling-in-love-with-a-hot-russian-assassin thing possible, and then just let the feels guide you.
Some people like this, others don't, so don't think that you'll have to force yourself to like it, that's weird"
924,2020-04-15 00:17:39,g0x07t,"Not to be a dick but have you ever heard the terms character driven and plot driven?

Killing Eve is a character driven show, that is why it is not plot heavy ie less focus on the spy elements.

If you want it to be plot driven you are in the wrong lane pal (see what I did there)."
925,2020-04-14 11:48:31,g0x07t,"Ya but it’s gay. 


Seriously though if you don’t like it you just don’t like it, not that deep."
926,2020-04-15 09:59:57,g0x07t,"Tbh, I'm really confused as well. I didn't really follow along the story much, but I did love character interactions and scenes. Personally I think the characters are extremely interesting and distinct - but I agree, some depth is lacking. Where are the backstories? The reasons for why characters act they way they do? They have a brilliant, gorgeous painting but we don't know what material the artist used to make it. We don't know why they chose the colours they did.

Nothing has really been fully explained yet (or if it has, I'm just daft), but there's always this general idea that ""the twelve did it!"". But I don't even know what the twelve is, how it works, why it does things, etc.

I always leave shows first thing for some reason, then later I come back to them interested. Especially when I want to love a show. It's happened with Steven Universe, Adventure Time, etc. I watch some episodes like ew then I read some more information on it and they eventually become shows I love and adore. So I totally get why you're asking. It's frustrating not being able to enjoy something most people do.

Heartbreakingly though, shows just aren't for everyone. I think Star Wars is trash and Breaking Bad got bad after like season 2 or 3, but this is an unpopular opinion. It's okay though, different strokes for different folks.

The thing about Killing Eve for me is that I watch it for the characters rather than for the plot (although I do enjoy the plot too, but if the characters weren't who they were, I'd have gotten bored a long time ago).

Also, the homoeroticism is amazing. I'm not even gay, but damn does it feel good to watch a show clearly not catering to the straight male gaze. OFC this is more a bonus than a reason to watch for me."
927,2020-04-14 22:48:13,g0x07t,"Season 2 wasn’t for everyone

I say try season 3 since the first episodes are coming out now

If you hate the first couple of episodes don’t continue

928,2020-04-15 06:28:11,g0x07t,"I LOVED season 1 and it's still one of my favorite shows because of that BUT Season 2 was really flawed. Too many plot holes and not enough character development. There were so many plotlines from Season 1 they could have followed up with but they went no where. The whole Aaron Peele storyline was really boring, Eves first kill was underwhelming, and most of the plot was completely void of logic lol. Villanelle was still a joy to watch though, really the only reason I'm still watching the show. Heres to hoping Season 3 at least MAKES SENSE."
929,2020-04-15 19:13:59,g0x07t,"I posted about my thoughts on S3, E1 and I admit I have similar feelings. No doubt I am not as much a tv watching person as many here but I have delved into only a few shows and for specific reasons such as Fleabag because of PWB and The Good Place because I find the deeper story meaning very interesting. Otherwise, I don't pursue shows. Killing Eve got my attention because again, Phoebe Waller Bridge writing the first season. May I mention here that I am also impressed that PWB insisted that Sandra Oh be cast as Eve - meaning, she told the casting director the part was written for Sandra and Waller-Bridge stood her ground on that point. Well done Phoebe; Oh is deeply talented and has been under valued until now.

I wrote:

>I  didn't like this episode with the jumping around to too many scenes  without setting a rhythm. To me, it felt like besides Sandra Oh the  actors were uncomfortable in their lines, or the overall script was not  well put together, and too much was thrown at me. The first season with  Phoebe Waller Bridge's outstanding mind & stellar writing just  hummed along seamlessly through a cohesive season. It was bound to be  hard to follow that up with a new show runner for the second season and  although the second season was okay I have been on the fence about  continuing to watch. I \*want\* to support the show truly. I want to give  my support to Sarah Barnett President of Entertainment at AMC, BBC  America et al who gave us this excellent show because she saw the deep  talent of PWB and put all this in motion. Barnett is the woman in charge  who said she wanted to see two strong female leads in a suspense drama  for AMC and man did PWB and the entire cast & crew deliver on that  in the first season.

>But this  first episode in Season 3 felt like a regression in terms of pace or  cohesion or something. In other words, there was too much going on and  not in a good way. Part of me felt bad for the actors because if I felt  the choppiness by watching the episode then I would imagine they might  have felt the lack of flow when shooting their scenes with the exception  of Oh's character.

To your question about ""what are you missing?  why does everyone like the show so much?"", for me I support various artists and creatives for different reasons just like I might like a song or two from a musician or band but not necessarily like their entire album collection. This applies to K.E. on several levels for my initial support of this show. I applauded PWB's brilliant story telling in first season, the outstanding chemistry with not just Oh and Comer but I liked other characters chemistry such as Constantine and Villanelle, Bill and Eve, for example.

I hear you about the story telling not doing it for you. I struggle with that too in terms of episode 1 of this season as you can see by what I have already posted. While I'm not an experienced tv aficionado, and I am selective if I do watch a rare show, I was drawn in to K.E. for the writing in season 1 of PWB in terms of her adaptation of Jennings novellas. It's as though I have trusted her instincts with this show. She is still involved and credited as Executive Producer. So my loyalty has been on a deeper level other than just the story telling component and stellar chemistry with Oh and Comer (I am not one who wants to see them hook up, to be clear). But I felt a disconnect with this episode and I went into it being very neutral with no expectations at all...just eager to see what will be the next phase in the story."
930,2020-04-16 20:11:38,g0x07t,"If it's not for you, it's not for you.  Move on."
931,2020-09-17 13:55:49,g0x07t,I gave up after the first season. The show is ridiculously overrated and borderline stupid. There is only so much disbelief I can suspend.
932,2020-04-14 05:22:28,g0x07t,"I had my best friend watched Killing Eve once. And although she appreciates how beautifully made it was, and even lauded Jodie Comer for that first two minutes of “Nice Face”, she couldn’t stand it. She said that Jodie did too good a job at copying that guy’s facial expressions that if someone did that to her niece or nephew (i.e., flick an ice cream) she’d flip tables and confront the woman. She couldn’t stand any more of it after the first episode because of Villanelle, and said that while it seemed like a good show, she can’t go on because she’s a cinnamon roll so it’s not her type. (Okay, the point is, it’s okay if it’s not up to par with your taste)

That said, as someone who have read the books, I say the real thrill is when Villanelle and Eve finally starts uncovering things. This is why I’m hoping they would follow the general story of the books somehow (like PWB kinda did with Codename: Villanelle). Not (just) because of all the Villaneve stuff, but because things do make sense in the end. You’d see growth in Villanelle, as well as Eve. It’s just that the TV show sometimes tend to write a lot of filler episodes that we would’ve been fine without."
933,2020-04-14 07:55:51,g0x07t,"Your reasons are valid, if you ask me to describe whats the plot I would say it’s just two girls pining/obsessing over each other. The storyline with the twelve completely lost me. Every time they try to focus on a plot outside of villanelle it always fell half away and they go back to villanelle again lol! Anyway, it’s a campy show, mainly here for for the gay tension tbh... and Comer acting is fantastic, especially in S1 in my opinion."

935,2020-04-17 05:03:47,g0x07t,"This answers might just make me watch this show in a different light. The thing that draw me was the dark, quick wit, and odd humor eve seemed to have in first wow Isidra. Don’t know if that was te hook and a jump off point for the rest of the character. Tanks for your comment cos acting is magnificent."

940,2020-04-14 06:49:25,g0x07t,"That’s fair, but you laid out a whole lot of points for why you didn’t like the show that trying to offer any counter argument seems futile. It appears that you have you up; no point in trying to convince you otherwise."
941,2020-04-14 17:45:16,g0x07t,"It's hard to get someone to understand when you're not me, or the next person, or the next. We view things differently. Take comedy-what one person thinks is hilarious, another will think disgusting."
942,2020-04-14 07:30:18,g0x07t,"I didn't take ""what am I not seeing"" to mean ""convince me to watch."" Hope the discussion you've prompted engages you more than the show has."
943,2020-04-14 03:56:09,g0x07t,"Imo these cool assassin stories could never get too far without going all red tape, actual politics and string pulling which would draw focus away from the juicy main dynamic. I mean S3E1 just tried dethroning Carolyn from being all god-like and adds opposition within the department (now there're sides in MI6 yay) to set up more of the twelve plot but see how that went over many people's heads and bored them.

Season one avoided the trap by treading very lightly on this stuff (why would Nadia a not very good assassin be saved instead of just disposed of, and why put her into a prison before she heals like what's the point), but as the story goes on they can't hide the twelve forever so more cracks start to show."
944,2020-04-15 00:41:29,g0x07t,"The show is a dramedy. It's not supposed to be some deep dive into the psychology of spies and psychopaths. Having said that, it seems like this season is supposed to dive deeper into who these characters are. I can't say they will do this in a way that is gratifying for someone like yourself who seems to be looking for more depth in plot and character."
945,2020-04-15 22:00:46,g0x07t,"Nah I agree entirely. Personally I think it's really well made, but you're right, the characters are pretty paper thin, even though they are very different types of paper. LGBTQ+ representation is very valuable and incredibly lacking. There could be 100 big movies in a year made of good, solid LGBTQ+ representation and it still wouldn't touch the amount of heteronormativity already present despite a bunch of straight people complaining about forced diversity.

It's a bummer when you watch one and realise it's not very good, or you don't like it, because it's not like LGBTQ+ folk have the pick of the litter when it comes to media made for the public. It's take what little is there and asking for anything else is """"""""forced diversity >:'((("""""""". Despite, you know, most people not being 100% straight but hey I won't go off on too big a tangent/

If you're looking recommendations, ""Feel Good"" on netflix is about a gay couple with Issues(TM), but it's incredibly interesting and there's more depth to the characters than there is in the pit in my heart!"
946,2020-04-16 00:35:02,g0x07t,Maybe to set up and show Carolyn is the puppet master? She's good at manipulating people to get them to do what she wants all the while they believe it was their idea.
947,2020-04-14 04:17:06,g0x07t,[deleted]
948,2020-04-14 04:18:46,g0x07t,"Agree with everything you said - but just highlighting the Nadia point: So, Nadia was left to die by Villanelle; however, since Frank was there, his old woman crime partner might have sent the russian intelligence agents after him - they found Nadia's body on the scene, and sent her to a prison in Russia. The 12 (through K) find out and tell V to go inside the prison and finish off Nadia before she reveals anything."

950,2020-04-14 04:50:47,g0x07t,"Their relationship is the backbone, the spy stuff is spice. I think it's similar to disaster/zombie stories that focuses on the dynamics of a small group, in this case it's 2 woman dealing with their obsession and hurting people around them instead of the fractured group drama package.

Of course it would be better if the spy stuff gets bumped up a notch but sadly it isn't the priority"
951,2020-04-14 04:42:35,g0x07t,"But why send Nadia to prison at all, I'd have thought that locking her in a room somehwere would have sufficed.

If the old woman is not affiliated with the twelve (I don't think it was 100% explicit that she was) and is just a russian gov agent it would be better for her side to keep Nadia hidden for interrogation. 

If the old woman is affiliated with the twelve I don't understand why they wouldn't get rid of Nadia seeing that she isn't a top tier assassin and not worth a lot. Unless the twelve wanted Nadia to be saved by the british to infiltrate that side but that would depend on them knowing that Eve would insist to get her out and it's pure speculation


Eh I just don't know"
952,2020-04-15 22:53:08,g0x07t,"I haven't read the books - but the books are alllways better, worth reading a preview of, perhaps?

And yes! That's the right one! Put it on that ""movies/series to watch sometime, eventually, probably, maybe"" list!!"
953,2020-06-15 19:52:09,g0x07t,"They should bump up the spy stuff, but I sadly think it will cost too much money"
954,2020-04-14 04:59:56,g0x07t,They might've sent Nadia to prison as an excuse to trap Villanelle in there too because she was too out of control. They knew V would successfully kill her but had no real intention of getting her out. BUT then they found out Konstantin was working with the British so they got her out to kill him. I assume they didn't think another assassin would be successful.
955,2020-04-14 05:18:36,g0x07t,"yeah that's a solid interpretation. Little bit strange now that I think about it how Konstantin had for some reason zero sense of danger when waltzing into his own house, after all that happened. ~~the twelve is short on assassins and have a 1 star rating on glassdoor~~"
956,2020-04-14 05:22:08,g0x07t,I don't think he knew he was in danger. He was probably unaware The Twelve knew of his double dealings. And he assumed Villanelle was in prison forever.
957,2020-04-14 05:34:46,g0x07t,I see that would make sense

959,2020-04-13 19:55:37,g0pfot,"Did you catch the part where Eve was at work in the kitchens and one of the guys said "" at first it was infatuation , now its love"" Eve started to laugh as if she could relate. Makes me think how deep did Eve feelings run for Villianelle. 

Also I found it interesting when it was revealed where V shot Eve. It look like it was close to the heart. Obviously V was really trying to kill Eve IF she aimed for the heart however V is a highly skilled assassin and I dont see her missing especially from the range she was at in the ruins. If V wanted that bullet to pierce Eves heart it would have or maybe Im just looking into this to deeply idk lol. 

Only Villianelle could wear an all black suit to her own wedding and proceed to make her whole speech about her "" dead ex girlfriend."" I thought that was hilarious and I wanna find out how V managed to finesse her way into that marriage."
960,2020-04-13 22:05:01,g0pfot,Isn't the point of the kill scene that she ends up replicating Dasha's murder at the beginning? Since Dasha said that everyone studies her kills...
961,2020-04-13 23:22:52,g0pfot,"I also enjoyed the episode more after a second viewing, though I liked it the first time well enough.  Villanelle doesn't feel like Villanelle but I think a lot of that is intentional.  She hasn't been killing for these 6 months (as far as we know, at least not working for The Twelve) and is still recovering from Eve.  It's taken a toll on her and she's not herself.  She also didn't have Konstantin to play off of, they have a great dynamic.  Tbh on rewatch I wasn't paying much attention to any non-Villanelle scenes.  She is the whole show to me."
962,2020-04-13 21:08:53,g0pfot,"Is it confirmed they went Hobbit-style higher framerate, or did they just mess with the shutter speed to make that look?  Either way, I'm not a fan.  Reminds me of the 30 Rock live episode: ""Why do I feel like I'm in a Mexican soap opera?"""
963,2020-04-13 21:12:56,g0pfot,"I watched the episode one time only but you summarised all my feelings and impressions. I was expecting a lot of Villanelle after reading some reviews, but I was quite surprised with Eve's scenes. And this comes from someone who was quite mad at Eve's actions.  Sandra Oh was flawless.

The wedding felt a little out of place. Villanelle's killing was ordinary. I mean, not shocking or  ""Villanelesque"",  if you know what I mean.

I believe it was a good starting place for the season. Even the shocking ending, it was somehow necessary. What else could bring Eve back? It was horrible and brilliant at the same time."
964,2020-04-13 19:31:56,g0pfot,"Thanks for this, you made some really solid points and it's encouraged me to rewatch it too!"
965,2020-04-13 22:52:52,g0pfot,Did anybody mention the photographer at the wedding making snapshots of V and D fighting? I bet those shots will give a thread to follow when published.
966,2020-04-13 23:54:39,g0pfot,"To me this episode felt different than the last two seasons, but it makes sense since we've had some time away from these characters. The editing and pacing didn't help, it seemed like they were trying to have everything caught up in this episode. 

I loved Eve's scenes in particular - they had some great callbacks, like with Kenny in s1 when she asks to go the bathroom and he asks her how much toilet paper she wants and then she texts him that photo of toilet paper. Their whole friendship really. It's really a testament to Sandra's acting and how Eve's written that she can have an interesting dynamic/chemistry with pretty much every other character. Also when Eve yells at her coworker who's complaining about the girl ""it's because you feel stupid, you were stupid"". So many good moments. I'm biased because I was always invested in Eve as a character but I think this is going to be a really good season for Eve. 

I wasn't as intrigued by Villanelle's scenes tbh, although how disinterested she looked at her own wedding *sent me*. I liked Dasha, but so far the V and Dasha dynamic doesn't really hold up to what V and Konstantin have, and it seems like they're trying to do the same thing. 

I think I'll wait to do a full rewatch after the entire season is over, but thinking back on this episode, it isn't as bad as I first thought."
967,2020-04-13 19:47:24,g0pfot,"Agree on the wasted potential of the wedding - it could have been in Episode 2 - Episode 1 could be more mysterious - what is everyone up to? We can see Eve visit Niko, we can see Kenny at his new job, we can see Konstantin on his various phones, and we see V with this new person all the while being watched. The end is that we realize V is finalizing plans for the ending and the last scene is at the rehearsal dinner when we realize it is V who is getting married. 

Thank you for noting the editing. I thought it was just my impression skewed by the commercial breaks. Saw it on line again and it was a bit smoother.

Don't need to rush to the big set pieces."
968,2020-04-14 00:22:03,g0pfot,Bro I was just thinking about how weird that wedding scene was? Like does Villanelle just have some chick that was just married then abandoned?
969,2020-04-13 20:41:44,g0pfot,"I also enjoyed it more on the second time around, the first felt very disjointed!"
970,2020-04-14 02:04:35,g0pfot,"""earlier I thought her accent slipped"" minor point but you know she doesn't sound like Queen's English at all in real life right? She's Scouse."
971,2020-04-13 21:54:07,g0pfot,"I enjoyed it more the second time around too. I can partially blame the mediocre kill on Villanelle's recreation of Dasha's but I still wanted her to slice the woman's Achilles tendon with the box cutter. 

Good catch with the can dropping metaphor."
972,2020-04-14 08:02:00,g0pfot,"im gonna be real im extremely disappointed in the premiere, like by 2 min in i was already done w the writing and it only got worse imo. i made some long ass posts abt it and got it all out there so ig im a little less bitter now. but i just wanted to say, your post is rly good and points out little things i totally missed and i appreciate u making it even tho u werent a big fan of it either. 

also- has anyone mentioned the girl at the korean market talking abt spaghetti, when that's what eve answered when villanelle asked what she wanted for dinner in rome? i feel like it's a bit on the nose that the girl mentioned that, a trip to rome, and romance in like the same sentence, but it's neat ig"
973,2020-04-13 23:54:38,g0pfot,"Definitely agree! I just re-watched it before I saw your post and I feel the same way. I think the episode was so fast paced that I didn't catch everything the first time around. I was able to really break down the dialogue and specific acting choices the second time I watched and it really helped me understand the direction of the episode better. 

This episode will definitely flow a lot better once the full season hits streaming services without commercials. I'll be able to watch without being so distracted and hopefully the episodes will blend nicely. I'm a lot happier with the direction of S3 after my second watch.

Since I have nothing but time on my hands in quarantine, I'll probably watch it a few more times before next week's episode hahaha."
974,2020-04-13 19:56:25,g0pfot,I agree!but to be honest I’ve forgot most things I feel like season 1/2 was more memorable because she was already killing people brutally and it was more memorable.
975,2020-04-14 08:26:16,g0pfot,"I loved the part where she went british for a minute! She does a really good posh British accent, considering she’s Liverpudlian :))"
976,2020-04-13 22:07:36,g0pfot,[deleted]
977,2020-04-14 03:43:52,g0pfot,"Yeah - caught that - but I thought Eve's laugh was more her laughing at her co-worker (with the other co-worker) for escalating infatuation to love with zero to no proof. It was more of a, what do you know kind of laugh, I thought."
978,2020-04-14 05:58:02,g0pfot,">V is a highly skilled assassin and I dont see her missing especially from the range she was at in the ruins. If V wanted that bullet to pierce Eves heart it would have

I was thinking the same thing, but then upon rewatching Season one I noticed she doesn't have that good of a shot. She misses her target quite a lot for a ""trained assassin""."
979,2020-04-14 03:37:36,g0pfot,"I think the paprika display was an afterthought - after she went from calm to fury because that woman attacked back. I don't think Villanelle planned to mirror Dasha (the writers definitely were angling for that obviously) - she just happened to when the opportunity presented itself, as a (hopefully) scoff at Dasha's ""untouchable"" kills.   


But the ""closer look"" on that scene seems to imply that they thought the murder was very inventive and brutal - so I am not sure what exactly to think ""\_""."
980,2020-04-13 22:24:36,g0pfot,I felt the same but booooooring.
981,2020-04-14 03:41:55,g0pfot,"Based on the brilliant explanations given by others on the thread, there is definitely a change in either fps or shutter speed. Because for sure its shot differently where the movement appears choppy. Apparently it felt soap opera-y because historically only soap operas are said to have employed this different frame rate (and its funny that so many people felt that it was soap opera-y even without knowing the reason behind it)."
982,2020-04-14 03:57:01,g0pfot,"I swear I'm the only one who didn't notice a higher framerate, and I *hate* that ""soap opera"" look. The first thing I do with a new TV is turn that damn motion-smoothing setting off."
983,2020-04-14 02:43:33,g0pfot,You are referring to the cinematography? I don't see what you mean about it looking like a mexican soap opera
984,2020-04-14 03:03:41,g0pfot,"I don’t know why it kept happening but the voices kept speeding ahead of the video when I watched, so I’d have to rewind a bit to sync. Never happened before this episode or for anything else I watch..."
985,2020-04-15 16:36:18,g0pfot,"It was definitely shot in 60+fps lol. I tried watching the first few minutes, and found it unwatchable. Felt like I was watching a commercial or YouTube video. Does not look good for a major network TV show, they failed big time in that regard."
986,2020-04-14 03:39:30,g0pfot,"Yeah - agreed. Villanelle's kill has several better angles than the one they chose to go with in the Closer Look segment though (they thought the murder was brutal and inventive, while obviously being a parallel to dasha's) - but it would have made more sense to have her scoff at this boring murder being ""untouchable""."
987,2020-04-14 02:42:10,g0pfot,Definitely agree on kenny death being the catalyst to bring her back...
988,2020-04-14 03:34:39,g0pfot,"Yeah - that was quite funny XD. And the host going, ""no photos!"""
989,2020-04-14 03:30:54,g0pfot,"Yeah - it gets better with every rewatch. Almost all the scenes have very good dialogue and are well constructed. The editor messed it up quite a bit which impacted the first viewing experience - but the scenes by themselves are quite good.   


I loved Eve in this episode - I also loved Eve in S1, but found her humour dull and flat in S2 - but in this episode I really found joy in her scenes again, even though ironically enough she is completely broken. And it's because her dialogue and scenes are good, and Sandra Oh absolutely smashed it. Loved the call-back to the loo roll too; and even when she gets pissed off with her co worker about his fret over his love life. Love that Eve is now giving love advice XD.   


I think Konstantin and V is truly special, and doubt that will ever can be repeated with someone else. I like her dynamic with Dasha, and I see a lot of potential - just Harriet walters voice choice is very grating to the ears."
990,2020-04-14 02:37:19,g0pfot,"I found it kind of unnecessary, like I understand her hooking up with someone else but marriage? that was mad extra"
991,2020-04-13 21:06:14,g0pfot,"Yup - exactly. It felt sooo choppy and abrupt the first time. I think the second viewing helps because you already know what's to come, so there is no silent anticipation that makes the cut seem longer. Also, more time to soak in the scenes - again, I think familiarity helped with this one - scenes seemed more wholesome whereas earlier they seemed rushed."
992,2020-04-14 03:20:21,g0pfot,"Yup, I do know that - but I thought she got the accent wrong, not slipped back to her original accent :)."
993,2020-04-14 03:33:34,g0pfot,"It does get better with every viewing, so there is that! I was way more meh about Villanelle's/Jodie's scene initially, and I liked them a lot more the second time around (still think that the kill and the wedding scene were the weakest scenes of the episode)."
994,2020-04-14 02:39:33,g0pfot,"""Since I have nothing but time on my hands in quarantine, I'll probably watch it a few more times before next week's episode hahaha"" LEGIT MY MOOD RIGHT NOW"
995,2020-04-13 23:29:18,g0pfot,Oh!! I didn't know her character was bad with a gun. It does explain why she didn't hit Frank. I thought she shot Eve in the abdomen to cuz it looked like it from how she was laying. I was a bit surprised when I seen the scar on her upper back
996,2020-04-17 00:59:06,g0pfot,I thought it was Saffron she used? As that’s what the woman recommended for the sick “grandfather”
997,2020-04-14 01:33:07,g0pfot,"I think it was meant to be boring. She didn't want to do it, Dasha complimented her kills, so I took it as a middle finger/two finger salute to The Twelve."
998,2020-04-14 04:59:37,g0pfot,I didn't notice either but I also didn't re-watch season 1 or 2 it's been a year since I've watched. Guess that's my bad
999,2020-04-14 12:51:09,g0pfot,I am the same way and I didn't notice either 🤷‍♀️
1000,2020-04-14 11:36:38,g0pfot,I absolutely agree with your comment about Eve being off in S2. I felt the same way and I’m very excited to see our girl is back in S3.  The writing is sharp and crisp. You’re right. Eve is at her most broken and hit bottom. However there’s only one way to go but up. I’m excited about this season.
1001,2020-04-14 03:24:31,g0pfot,"I think overall marriage execution was not executed up to its potential - but as an idea, I loved it. It is just like Villanelle to be mad extra after she has gone through Rome - I can imagine her thinking that she *can love*, and won't be rejected and goes and finds the first person she lays her eyes on - I also think it was a survival thing given that she had nobody left, and no money (I am guessing the 12 froze her account)."
1002,2020-04-14 00:50:16,g0pfot,"If you want to kill someone you usually shoot them many times. Esp emotionally based/revenge etc. Villanelle is not only a bad shot, but also blind, or she is conflicted between hate and 'love' as Suzanne Heathcote, the same person, says she doesn't want to kill her, but wants to punish her. From her own words ""Villanelle is all about control and feeling like she's in control. It was so conflicting for her that moment at the end of season 2. She punished Eve for not wanting to be with her, but she didn't necessarily want Eve dead even though she was committing that act. I just think it was a real act of conflict for Villanelle.""

There's more there etc. tl;dr she doesn't fuck it up. She doesn't want to kill her as explicitly said by that very same writer. Your theory is probably right."
1003,2020-04-14 00:50:25,g0pfot,"\*Extra points of zero relevance: If Villanelle cannot shoot someone in the range of hand-to-hand combat she is not 'bad' she is someone who has never even used one. It isn't ""a bad shot"" from that range, it is chronic ineptitude to the degree it's pointless to describe. Those who do this, the army etc., know it. And of the first main thing that is practiced 100%, with Villanelle so skilled she takes liberties in 'decorative' kills. Plus despite shooting Anton in the head S1E7 from basically the same distance like it's nothing in a hearbeat."
1004,2020-04-14 04:51:30,g0pfot,True good point! She kept referencing her fiancé shoes her pool etc. it had to be survival. The episode was just toying with me bc I kinda wanted her to be moping over Eve and I didn't get that right away LOL
1005,2020-04-14 03:45:29,g0pfot,"Yeah - this is much more plausible - she effs up sub-consciously when her emotions are entangled with her victim. Because she deep down doesn't want to do it, but can't process that sentiment, and does it anyway - but messes up."
1006,2020-04-13 19:09:41,g0oue2,"She still follows her on Twitter and Sandra said a few weeks ago they are good friends but haven't seen each other since long time ago.

I wouldn't give much importance to it."
1007,2020-04-13 19:14:19,g0oue2,Maybe she doesn't want to see spoiler for killing eve on her Instagram
1008,2020-04-13 18:53:16,g0oue2,Why what happened?
1009,2020-04-13 19:29:59,g0oue2,She’s also unfollowed Beyoncé.  Weird considering she had Camilla reenact the pregnancy announcement pose
1010,2020-04-13 18:56:54,g0oue2,"Sandra Oh was doing her own thing post Grey’s. We barely heard anything from her character on the show. To the point some fans would jokingly say they forget Mer and Cristina are BFFs and would still communicate even via text. Fast forward to Sandra’s Killing Eve acclaim and history making Emmy nomination. Then all of a sudden you heard from the cast congratulating her and even bringing up the idea of her character making an appearance on Grey’s. 

Meredith was also shown much more predominantly texting Cristina in various episodes thereafter. Something that didn’t happen since Sandra left. I don’t think the cast is as close as we would like to think. Nothing wrong with that. It’s a big cast. But yikes to downright unfollow. Maybe Sandra turned down offer to come do a guest appearance since now the show is a hot mess. I’m obviously joking here."
1011,2020-04-14 06:20:26,g0oue2,Sandra only follows four people so I don’t think we should worry
1012,2020-04-24 00:39:38,g0oue2,"She unfollowed Caterina Scorsone and Camilla Luddington too, what could they have possibly done to her?"
1013,2020-05-24 03:55:43,g0oue2,"She also recently unfollowed Caterina, Camilla and Kevin McKidd on Instagram. I found this all really odd. She always says she loves them on various platforms... why would you unfollow."
1014,2020-05-27 12:07:21,g0oue2,"Ellen unfollowed Jessica, Camilla, Caterina, Sandra, Kevin... it's very confusing. Then she started following Katherine."
1015,2020-04-14 00:01:43,g0oue2,Wait rly what happend my heart is dying
1016,2020-04-13 19:46:15,g0oue2,"She promoted Killing Eve on her Twitter two weeks ago. Sometimes Instagram or twitter unfollows people automatically, it’s weird."
1017,2020-04-13 23:53:08,g0oue2,"Ellen has praised Sandra’s work on Twitter ever since she left the show, not just after Killing Eve became popular. I think people often read too much into the social media habits of strangers"
1018,2020-04-13 19:13:07,g0oue2,"The cast always spoke highly of Sandra and was supportive of everything after she left not just after the Emmy's or all the buzz she got.

Cristina's mentions came with Krista who in general seems to love the call-backs from the early days.

And I think they all hope for her to come back obviously but they seem to know that it probably won't happend (Kevin and Ellen have talked about it)."
1019,2020-06-02 04:36:12,g0oue2,Did she ever follow Kevin? I don’t remember her following him but I remember her following the others

1021,2020-04-13 14:19:46,g0jrdj,"Would love to see Eve look this happy tbh.

I used a photo of Sandra Oh from an event as the ref, this was mostly an art study for lighting and because I rarely draw people smiling, especially with teeth."
1022,2020-04-15 13:11:17,g0jrdj,That's a beautiful piece of work. You should make sure she receives a copy.
1023,2020-04-13 14:46:22,g0jrdj,I love this

1025,2020-04-13 14:39:39,g0jrdj,This is really cool. Great job!
1026,2020-04-14 22:20:47,g0jrdj,VERY nice work.   Really quality stuff.

1028,2020-04-13 17:52:11,g0jrdj,I also wish Eve was this happy tbh.

1033,2020-04-13 08:16:04,g0au32,"Me and my dad watches Killing Eve when I visit. Last time I was there we were talking about how she looked fine in Grey’s Anatomy but age didnt do her well (like it usuallt does). At least, thats my dad’s opinion. I never really have an opinion on the looks of actors/celebrities lol."
1034,2020-04-13 03:27:24,g0au32,I am just saying I love the show and I accepted what I saw at first but it is like a scratch that I can't reach and it is driving me mad. I just googled to find someone that would agree with me yet I found quite the opposite... Must be my eyes then.
1035,2020-04-13 15:41:04,g0au32,Age is a fair argument but why would the cast and the plotline keep trying to convince you that Eve is some sort of a beauty or something like in season 1 she had a good-looking husband and an ultra-hot assassin actually talking about her as if she is the second coming of Aphrodite or something. I almost stabbed my eyes to the brain that time. I also feel so toxic writing this which is not the normal me but I am here to rant anyway.
1036,2020-04-13 05:35:13,g00iam,Hahaha!!!
1037,2020-04-13 06:08:28,g00iam,LMFAO

1039,2020-04-12 14:31:40,fzxe3t,What do you mean by Sandra Oh's latest instagram post? It's a photo of a tree
1040,2020-04-12 14:34:12,fzxe3t,Oh whoops. It’s the one on the official KE Instagram where she’s just talking about the show
1041,2020-04-11 19:13:52,fzd2pr,"> A lot of people seem to think that the moment you see Cthulhu your ""Sanity Meter"" just immediately takes a hit and you basically shit your brain out of your ass.

That is pretty much the result of the *Call of Cthulhu Roleplaying Game*. While the Sanity mechanic is one of the defining features of the system, it doesn't actually do a good job of emulating either madness in the Mythos or real-world mental disorders."
1042,2020-04-11 19:42:28,fzd2pr,"“Then, bolder than the storied Cyclops, great Cthulhu slid greasily into the water and began to pursue with vast wave-raising strokes of cosmic potency. Briden looked back and went mad, laughing shrilly as he kept on laughing at intervals till death found him one night in the cabin whilst Johansen was wandering deliriously.
     But Johansen had not given out yet.”

^  I’d say it’s all in the story."
1043,2020-04-11 23:29:58,fzd2pr,"That's how I understand it. Cthulhu isn't even one of the more sanity-breaking figures in the mythos. He's got a defined physical form that can actually be comprehended by human eyes and the human mind. 

It's just that his existence leads to deeply disturbing implications about the universe and mankind. At least as far as Lovecraft himself wrote Cthulhu in the one story he did, I can't speak for later authors' additions.

Trying to comprehend Yog-Sothoth or something of his caliber in its entirety on the other hand might actually have some kind of BLIT/basilisk effect."
1044,2020-04-11 22:34:31,fzd2pr,"Spoilers for the comic *Fall of Cthulhu* ahead:

>!Dirk, a battle-hardened sheriff familiar with combat and cultists, gets one look at Cthulhu and *immediately* tries to blow his brains out. He then goes ax-crazy and talks about the ""big fishy.""!< So it definitely seems like near-instant insanity, especially coupled with the other sources mentioned."
1045,2020-04-11 23:19:47,fzd2pr,"I imagine it's different for everyone. When it comes to the realization that eldritch entities exist and humanity is all but powerless against them (unless you're Randolph Carter, but he doesn't really outright defeat Nyarlathotep for good, just outwit him, or Armitage, who just makes Cthulhu sleep again), it probably hits differently. For some, I imagine its a quick deteroriation, while for others, they spiral into despair with a slow but inevitable fall.

I think you're right when you talk about questioning what's going on. Learning about how the universe works in Lovecraft's work is a pretty bleak and hopeless thing that would likely lead to severe disillusionment and a disconnect with reality once they get the blow of ""there is no meaning and the gods don't care if their actions kill you (except Nyarlathotep, he likes it because he's a douche)."""
1046,2020-04-12 13:47:33,fzd2pr,"Don't forget that Cthulhu has psychic powers. He can drive some people insane even when he's in slumber using dreams (not that it's something he's trying to do, it's basically a side effect of him being alive). I always thought that psychic power/presence was a big part of the ""see Cthulhu, go insane"" thing."
1047,2020-04-12 18:25:43,fzd2pr,"I've nerfed it in some of my games for this reason, but going insane in fun ways is kind of the point of that game at the end of a day, they can NEVER really win."
1048,2020-04-14 01:33:46,fzd2pr,Is that game any good. I was thinking about playing it
1049,2020-04-14 01:36:58,fzd2pr,"If you got a good group that understands there is no happy ending, just have fun on the journey then it's a blast. My party were close friends that are familiar with the mythos and the game, so they instantly went into ""Let's see how far we can push our luck."" mode a lot of the time."
1050,2020-04-14 01:37:39,fzd2pr,Oh. I meant the video game adaptation. Is it any good?
1051,2020-04-14 01:39:42,fzd2pr,"OH. I haven't played it, however. I have heard that The Sinking City, while not perfect, is a better Lovecraftian game than Call of Cthulu. Haven't played either yet, but a reviewer that's pretty critical said he can't hate sinking city despite it's flaws, cause it was clear they really give a shit about the game and cosmic horror."
1052,2020-04-14 01:41:26,fzd2pr,"Looks pretty epic, does appear that the creators care. Looks like I found what I’m going to spend tomorrow doing"
1053,2020-04-10 11:15:52,fxzg1a,Jingle bell is SO underrated. Sam is bae
1054,2020-07-04 21:59:44,fxzg1a,i thoroughly disagree with 478. Alex Newall did not carry Blake for NOTHING. that’s all on that.
1055,2020-04-09 20:14:04,fxzauf,"I think this is my favorite list so far, at least as far as the top songs go. The Scientist is my #1 from the season and I gave my 11 to my underrated fave, Don’t Dream It’s Over, and it made it to #7! Yay! Also Jake’s Let Me Love You is one of my favorite solos from the entire show so to see it ranked that high makes me happy.

I usually agree that Santana’s songs are overrated; HOWEVER, her solos this season are probably my absolute favorites of hers. Mine, Girl On Fire, Nutbush City Limits, AND Cold Hearted? I might side-eye the excessive praise in other rates, but I’m okay with it here.

That said... do people have vendettas against Rachel?! I mean... c’mon! It was ridiculous back in S2 when My Man was only 32 (still the biggest travesty). But... the bias here is so obvious! Have you guys heard her do O Holy Night?! Lea even did it again for her Christmas album, that’s how iconic it is! (And if you have any doubt about her power with this song... please watch some of the live performances she did in December.) And To Love You More... THAT low... no words. NO WORDS!

I’m just glad that The Break-Up is the highest rated episode (though I didn’t have any doubt). I still think Barely Breathing could be higher. I think it’s worthy, but I’m also so depressed over the lack of Finn this season. What we do have I think are some of his absolute best vocal performances. (His voice in The Scientist and Don’t Dream It’s Over!!!) 

Lastly, I love the love for Marley’s voice in the top 10 - Chasing Pavements and New York State of Mind are gorgeous."
1056,2020-04-10 05:14:06,fxzauf,Hung Up and 3 deserves so much better wtf
1057,2020-04-11 17:58:42,fxzauf,"S2 and S4 definitely had some of my favorite songs. And I believe the reason you may be tired of Santana getting so highly ranked is now in S4 she has much more of a role (if you think about it, screen time for her and Finn from S1 compared to S4 essentially flip-flopped). However, she deserves it. Naya Rivera has good acting, a great voice, and personally, I think she rocked whatever solo came her way, regardless of thr song itself"
1058,2020-04-09 20:14:17,fxzauf,"This is so awesome, thank you for making this. And yes totally agree on There Are Worse Things I Could Do. Maybe if they had made it a full Santana solo it would have gotten better ratings, I think that may be why - because it did kind of ruin the song a bit for me."
1059,2020-04-09 22:33:36,fxzauf,"To Love You More should be so much higher, that's all I am going to say."
1060,2020-04-10 19:24:19,fxzauf,The fact that I keep looking through the list and saying that this one deserves higher shows how strong the music was
1061,2020-04-11 00:56:07,fxzauf,I for one am thrilled to see Love Song getting its just due at long last. Listen to those harmonies!
1062,2020-04-09 22:31:38,fxzauf,">Okay, the Santana love was cute in the previous two rankings, but it's getting pretty old.

Never. Yes, I am biased."
1063,2020-04-10 19:25:24,fxzauf,Y'all are sleeping on Tina's songs this season.
1064,2020-04-09 22:23:27,fxzauf,Call me maybe is a bop
1065,2020-04-12 01:47:37,fxzauf,"I'm shocked about the placement of Love Song, i wouldn't even rank it in the Top 40, let alone Top 3!! Y'all let your little fanfictions get a little too over your heads lmao... And yes, I agree that if any Santana song should've been at the top is There Are Worse..."
1066,2020-04-09 22:56:01,fxzauf,damn Hopelessly Devoted to You only got 25th
1067,2020-04-14 08:42:54,fxzauf,"I'll never get why let's have a kiki/turkey lurkey time gets so much hate, it deserves better"
1068,2020-08-01 14:24:25,fxzauf,You are the sunshine of my life was one of the cutest songs done in glee def deserved higher
1069,2020-08-09 00:02:36,fxzauf,I fund it funny that kurt won midnight madness but people think Rachels version of the song was better. (I agree that Rachel's was better btw)
1070,2020-08-28 12:20:09,fxzauf,Aw why is Everytime so low
1071,2020-04-09 22:53:33,fxzauf,"Imma get a lot of hate, and I do adore Santana’s voice, but I strongly dislike girl on fire. The original wasn’t pleasing to my ears either."
1072,2020-04-10 03:30:21,fxzauf,"And oh my gosh, I forgot to add: so glad everyone gave Jessica Sanchez the love she deserves!!!"
1073,2020-08-28 12:20:29,fxzauf,Dude Hung Up is one of Tina's best imo

Funny, quick story. Have always adored Keanu. Checking out Twitter. Who’s following me? “Keanu Reeves”!!! I was giddy! I was high thinking Keanu Reeves followed me! So I followed right back. “Keanu” immediately said “Hello dear.” Now, I knew the REAL Keanu Reeves would never be following me. Ever. But being alone and quarantined for...ever, I spent the day chatting with “Keanu Reeves”. Ha! In my wildest dreams.

But I could not stand Crash. Accepting it on its own terms means letting it preach to you its smarmy, populist-left, fake-intelligent values and feeling all morally superior and smug, and I just can't go there.

I would agree that if there's one redeeming aspect it would be Michael Pena's performance, which might be one of his best.

1133,2020-04-04 01:01:21,fujqpa,"It seems you keep thinking in extreme absolute straw mans such as thinking that people who do edgic think: “that there are patterns that all winners have”. No, that’s not what edgic is about. There is patterns that a large majority of winners have though, and there is exceptions since nothing works 100% of the time of course

Is there is “no winner’s edit” according to you how is edgic able to predict the winner within 3 episode 30% of the time, after merge episode 45% of the time, and before the finale 70% of the time?  (rough estimates)

With 6 people in the finale picking a winner at random is a 16.6% chance. Edgic turns that 1/6 chance into a 70% chance how can you deny that? Same logic applies to other points in the game. And that’s only accounting for the top contender not the person second most likely to win

And how would you explain Complex Tribe theory working 12 seasons in a row? Pure coincidence?

And I think you are missing the point when people talk about “contenders”. When we eliminate people it’s because they have such a small chance of winning that they are not considered

Can Sarah still win? Sure but it would be very unlikely. Can anybody besides Tony/Sophie/Tyson/Sarah win? Sure, but it would be extraordinarily unlikely"
1134,2020-04-04 02:17:27,fujqpa,"Editing isn't about observing one universal pattern. It is about following a dozen or more different patterns with their own intricacies. It is about following different features of edits to notice commonalities.

There are recurring trends for lots of winners. There is a reason edgic pinned Tommy as the winner almost instantly, and firmly before the premerge was over.

It isn't always right, but edgic isn't perfect and nobody pretends it is."
1135,2020-04-04 02:45:46,fujqpa,Is there a pattern?
1136,2020-04-04 01:27:43,fujqpa,"What is the pattern that the large majority of winners have?

Truly. 

The more seasons there are, the more it proves there IS no pattern.

Edgic is able to pick the person “70%” of the time by the finale because there are 5 people left. 

You’re putting the apple cart before the horse. You get better at predicting the winner the more the season goes on...because there are less people and you can see who is doing well and what kinds of players you’re dealing with.

Also, Edgic hasn’t gotten it right by the merge half the time. The entire point is that there’s no consensus because it is impossible to make a consensus. You’re giving credit to a few people who guess correctly. And you know this, because you experience it every season because most people don’t agree and feel it with such certainty.
(Also Edgic is such a smuggling route for spoiled speculation.)

Complex tribe? There is no complex tribe. What you describe as “complex tribe” is because the tribe that is likely to produce the winner is the tribe that often does the best, and thus the stories from that tribe are relevant to telling the story of the game. You describing the way you think is no better superstition."
1137,2020-04-04 02:55:00,fujqpa,"But you’re literally contradicting yourself.

I’ll break it down super simply:

Your entire system is based on the premise that there is a pattern to the winner that is decipherable and traceable during the season.

The point of a pattern is it predicts. 

If you’re saying there are dozens of patterns with their own intricacies — that’s not a pattern. That’s literally not what a predictable order is.

Tommy was an obvious winner. What is the pattern between Tommy and Chris? And based on those patterns, who wins Season 40?

*The truth: The reason there are a million different ratings and numbers is because you keep trying to predict that which you cannot use to predict.*

Before there was visibility 1-5, it was 1-3. And because that didn’t work — because it can’t — you added more to the system. And on and on and on. After 40 seasons, shouldn’t you have refined your by now?

Who’s gonna win Season 40 based on literally 39 seasons of what you’ve been refining? And if you can’t do that, what the hell are you refining?"
1138,2020-04-04 02:55:11,fujqpa,Nope!
1139,2020-04-04 02:24:34,fujqpa,"What do a strong majority of winners have you ask? Having a strong premiere. Having a strong merge episode. Being on the complex tribe. Not having a ton of negativity, etc. 

Again I just don’t understand your point. If there is “no pattern” at all when it comes to the edit then why when there are 15 players left in the game how is edgic able to predict the winner 25-30%ish of the time? Picking a player at random would be a 6.6% chances and that’s over quadrupling the odds. If edgic instead picked 4-5 contenders at that point in the game then they would have chosen the winner  80-90% of the time and that’s turning a 4/15 chance if there was no patterns into a 80-90% of picking the winner

Your logical argument against this is that we can see who is doing well in the game so we have a high chance of picking the winner. Or that nearly everybody who predicts it right is spoiled(despite edgic being just as reliable on unspoiled seasons) This doesn’t make sense though since the edit manipulates the viewer to show them who is doing well most of the time or to shoehorn screen-time to the winner for example. The edit doesn’t always tell the truth about what is happening in the game. It can be misleading

Lets use this season as a fresh example: Logically speaking, Kim this season is playing an excellent game. Jeremy arguably played the best pre merge game, Ben is playing great. Logically speaking Sarah maybe has the best chance in the game to win. Yet none of them have been portrayed that by the edit and have next to no chance of winning with their edit despite playing strong games

Logically speaking what is the chance that Tony or Tyson is going to get to the end and win this season? I would say absolutely no chance they are way too big of threats. But according to the edit I would say both of them combined have like a 40-70% chance of winning with Sophie taking up nearly all of the other %

Edgic isn’t an exact set of rules that work every time. But patterns shown in the edit work much more often than not"
1140,2020-04-04 02:58:54,fujqpa,"You’re acting like Survivor didn’t happen.

It happened. This isn’t 538 giving percentage chances for an upcoming presidential election.

That’s why again you have all this bullshit based upon a flawed central premise. What on earth are you talking about in terms of %s? There isn’t going to be a rerun of Season 40 with a different outcome. The winner has won, no matter what percentage you ascribe to their chances.

You’re literally ascribing a % chance of happening to something that has already happened.

Which is the point: Survivor is a game. The editing tells the story of that season’s game. A game that happened in real life, not in some fictional universe where all outcomes have a chance of happening just because you don’t know it."
1141,2020-04-04 03:37:27,fujqpa,"The edit does not show everything that is happening in the game or the entire story of the game. They condense the show into 60 minute episodes despite having thousands of minutes of footage. The edit doesn’t always depict what happened. It can be extremely misleading such as the Wendell v Michele fued this season

In simplest terms the story is edited with what happens throughout the entire season already in mind, and it is created backwards knowing how the season already turns out. If it was edited live like Big Brother the editing would obviously be drastically different and have more incoherent storylines or relationships, and we can directly compare this to BB to see the difference 

You’re right everything technically has a chance of happening, but by looking at past edit patterns we can see that some things have anywhere from a slightly higher chance of happening to extremely higher chance based off how they have edited the show in the past. And that’s how we do edgic :)"
1142,2020-04-04 04:26:46,fujqpa,"Why do you think the edit is created backwards? 

Saying the edit is created backwards is different from saying the edit is created looking at the scope of the season, which is what I would say. 

The edit doesn’t show itself invested in a particular outcome; it’s invested in creating a dramatic compelling game. The story is the game being played that season, not the outcome. Related? Sure. But the outcome is not the source point."
1143,2020-04-04 06:15:02,fujqpa,"People think that the show is edited backwards because the people who edited it say as much. Each episode is edited so that the elimination makes sense; the season is edited so the final result makes sense. The outcome \*is\* the source point. It would have to be: the editors know the outcome. 

Sean Foley, Survivor editor: ""Tribal Council is the destination of the story arc, so we typically work backward from there. Who got voted off and why? Who else was in jeopardy? Who were the shot-callers pulling the strings? We start by  creating a simple outline of the A, B and C stories for each tribe and  then watch virtually every bit of footage we can to find enough moments  to craft compelling scenes.""

This quote, incidentally, comes from a recent article on Survivor editing, some of which lines up with what you are saying and some of which doesn't, so it might be of interest to you: [https://cinemontage.org/cbs-survivor-editors-editing/](https://cinemontage.org/cbs-survivor-editors-editing/) The take on the 'winner's edit' from the editors themselves seems to be that it is a fan construct, but one of the editors does suggest that it corresponds with an inevitable editorial emphasis on many players who go the distance - if they aren't boring. 

My own take is that edgic's limitations (which are real) lie elsewhere - the ratings system seems like a valuable approach to content analysis (separate to predicition) if applied consistently, but  the elements of the edit most often discussed as predictive seem to float a little free from the ratings system itself: complex tribe theory, personal content, alliance scenes, 'shielding' from too much negativity or seeming incompetent, etc. - basically all the things that identified Tommy so quickly. But these are all useful tools that have grown up with/around edgic."
1144,2020-04-04 16:43:24,fujqpa,"But that editor is literally saying what I’m saying.

He’s saying he works backwards from what happened IN THE GAME. He doesn’t work backwards by looking at who won and asking how that person’s story led to them winning."
1145,2020-04-02 03:56:40,ftf8tp,"But at that point, it’s not ghosting. You’ve communicated your displeasure clearly and fully, whether or not they want to listen.

Ghosting is just vanishing with no attempt made at all – ever. You don’t even give the person a chance to hear what went wrong, much less an opportunity to listen."
1146,2020-04-02 04:14:38,ftf8tp,"Simply put:

If you’re in an abusive relationship and you feel threatened, go ahead and ghost, get the fuck out and leave no trace of which direction you went.

1152,2020-04-02 04:45:23,ftf8tp,"Seek them out all you want.  If they don't respond, the emotional responsibility is now on you and your reaction(s).

\- Arizona District 4 has Stu Starky who is running for the Democratic nomination.  
\- Arizona District 7 has Dane Amling, who is running for the Democratic nomination.  
\- Bob Olsen shouldn't be included because ""humane immigration reform"" and ""gun reform"" sound like stereotypical liberal weasel words in the same vein as ""affordable healthcare"" that don't actually mean anything, and if he doesn't at least support M4A or a GND then there is nothing that separates him from any other neoliberal.   
\- Talia Fuentes is kinda iffy. There's literally a tweet of her's where she's trying to get Hillary Clinton's endorsement. While she is a better option than Stanton, I'm not sure if she qualifies as a full blown progressive.   
\- Scott Menor is another missing candidate, he's an independent running in Arizona's 5th congressional district.  
\- James Ellars lost his primary  
\- Peter Mathews and Jalen McLeod also lost their primaries.

Who pretended to be his friend and went mini-golfing with him, to take advantage of a guy who used his psychotic episodes to become a Zombie Killer.  


And if you think about it... it fits  


Leon's kind of an Evil Chuck

If Parvati comes back, then the merge will be perfectly even in terms of gender and tribes: 6 people from each original tribe, 3 men and women from each original tribe. 4 people from each of the swapped tribes, 2 men and two women from each of the swapped tribes.

Also yeah Sophie has a great edit and seems to be in a good position. But I think Nick has a chance to have a Winner’s edit and I would love to see that play out more. He’s been in a powerful middleman position for the last 2 tribals and has gotten important confessionals that show where he stood on the tribe. He didn’t get a big edit in the first few episodes, but not all winners start off so hot in the edit so that’s okay. Episode 1 he had a confessional about fire tokens and said whoever uses them the best will win this game. While it was just a cool confessional to tease the importance of fire tokens, which is what the producers probably wanted, it could be really cool foreshadowing."

I have one more thing to add to this. It is far fetched but why didn't Ethan make a postcard about Parvati coming to EoE considering she is his bestfriend out there? Maybe because she doesn't stay there for long ha."

1271,2020-04-23 06:49:27,frep2v,"Yep, even moreso now. Tbh I actually thought Sophie was winning and Parv was the dark horse, now with Sophie gone I think even more strongly that Parvati will win. Remember when Nick said the winner would use the currency correctly? She's been using the currency quite a bit and only got it wrong when she bought the nullifier.

Plus the edit gave her credit for Danni and Natalie figuring out clues."
1272,2020-03-30 01:34:30,frep2v,"I kniw. This was really well put together. My opinion on it is the same as it has always beed with an edge returnee winning. If they deserve it, cool. If they don't, well nothing we can do about it."
1273,2020-03-30 02:24:14,frep2v,"Heavens forbid, complexity!"
1274,2020-03-30 06:59:55,frep2v,I had kind of the same take. her story felt unfinished. I thought I was just being overly hopeful. Now I’m not sure
1275,2020-03-30 01:37:16,frep2v,It’s around 25 seconds [in this video.](https://www.cameo.com/v/5e7541a2c827cd01b2cf269d?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=video_share&utm_medium=ios_app&_branch_match_id=772984624183708654)
1276,2020-03-29 22:47:03,frep2v,Omg that would be a hilarious F3 and I am all for it
1277,2020-03-30 04:29:05,frep2v,no they wouldn't
1278,2020-03-30 17:24:48,frep2v,"I believe so because none of them respect EoE as part of the game, except for some (Nick, Amber, Sarah). And I respect that they wouldn't vote for an EoE returnee."
1279,2020-03-30 05:25:03,frep2v,"I feel like Nick has a weird edit in that he doesn’t have a super high quantity of confessionals, but when he does have them they are important to what’s happening in the game. Who knows though, he could get voted off next week (which they hinted at in the preview)."
1280,2020-03-30 02:25:49,frep2v,Same
1281,2020-03-30 08:11:12,frep2v,"I don't agree with your analysis. You could make as compelling an argument for Nick winning.

Parvati has no overarching storyline they've played up. No confessionals about seeking to become the GOAT. Or proving/dedicating it to her daughter. There's just no deeper storyline for her to fulfill. 

She might come back but I don't see her getting far at all."
1282,2020-03-30 01:37:21,frep2v,Thank you. I feel the same way. Whatever happens happens and its best to just enjoy it imo.
1283,2020-03-30 07:03:53,frep2v,"I mean, please do not hunt me down and kill me if I am wrong. But right now I am sitting at 50/50 on her and Sophie whereas yesterday I was 100% on Sophie."
1284,2020-03-30 01:39:29,frep2v,"Yeah I know people hate Chris, but he deserved to win. Gavin and Julie both didn't really do anything. He pulled one of the best moves I ever seen, going to make fire. He knew if DEvens was there he would win. It really boils down to that as a season"
1285,2020-03-30 01:46:19,frep2v,"Yeah I know its an unpopular opinion, but for me the entire season was a dud and then he saved it in the end. It was a twist ending, sure, but I felt his win was deserved."
1286,2020-03-30 02:32:49,frep2v,He made one move and sat out half the season. He didn’t deserve to win.
1287,2020-03-30 01:47:31,frep2v,IMO had Chris tken out Devens and lost it would've been one of th worst ever. Had Devens won it would've been right in the middle
1288,2020-03-30 02:48:33,frep2v,He made one more move than the other two
1289,2020-03-30 04:12:13,frep2v,Just because Gavin didn't play BiGG MoVEzz doesn't mean he wasn't deserving lol.
1290,2020-03-30 02:52:15,frep2v,Flashy move maybe but at least they played the whole game without being voted out. EOE negates the “outlast” portion of the logo. He played 12 days. Him winning is a disgrace to the show IMO.
1291,2020-03-30 12:37:57,frep2v,Survivor is all about BiGG MoVEzz tho lol
1292,2020-03-30 02:55:04,frep2v,I agree that it was flashy. Either he or Devens was going to win. They were both voted off. The season was a bit of a dud
1293,2020-03-30 03:05:40,frep2v,"Thats the show's fault, not his. Your anger is directed at the wrong person."
1294,2020-03-30 02:57:39,frep2v,"I would have been more ok with devens winning since at least he played the majority of the game and had to fight to stay. Chris came in with 6 people left and was gifted an idol. I can admit he made good moves in his short time back but the whole thing just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. No one should be coming back into the game at 6. 

EOE wouldn’t be so bad if they stopped at the merge returnee."
1295,2020-03-30 03:06:53,frep2v,"I agree and I don’t hate him, but I hate his win."
1296,2020-03-30 03:06:19,frep2v,"I agree, but Someone could've come in at 7 or 8 with a hint though."
1297,2020-05-03 10:28:33,gcnaxj,"Agree. I feel that Biden is even worse than Drumpf, and his dementia proves that!"
1298,2020-05-09 14:24:49,gcnaxj,What do you think of Bernies gang rape fantasy?
1299,2020-05-02 23:40:03,gcfys3,You know. If they violate a union rule. You can still stick it to them through the union.
1300,2020-05-03 02:20:10,gcfys3,"Thank you for sharing this. Kroger is the worst company I ever worked for. They do this all the time and get away with it. I hope you find a better place to work, and that you stay safe through all of this"

1323,2020-04-27 08:10:43,g8va0w,"I think it was both. Like when she eventually sat down, you could tell she enjoyed it. The song lyrics reinforce that as well. And then at the end we get even more clarification that she longs to be near her when she holds the recording to her ear and listens to it over and over."
1324,2020-04-27 07:54:12,g8va0w,I feel like there’s a little bit of both 😉
1325,2020-04-27 08:08:08,g8va0w,"Wasn't there a similar scene toward end of season 1, where we thought they were gonna do a ting but then eve like stabbed her?"
1326,2020-04-27 16:06:31,g8va0w,"She started the whole fight because she was under the impression she was about to be killed and she wasn't going to just sit there and take it. I think she definitely initiated the kiss to throw her off her guard because Villanelle pretty easily overpowered her. However, I don't think there's any question she got into it and it definitely meant something to her after the fact. So I'll go for both as well."
1327,2020-04-27 08:40:15,g8va0w,[deleted]
1328,2020-04-27 14:45:21,g8va0w,To me it didn't feel like a calculated move. I think Eve let herself go and just followed her desire for once!
1329,2020-04-27 08:44:11,g8va0w,Thats kind of what i was thinking. When she did it she only wanted to catch her off guard but after realized she liked it.
1330,2020-04-27 08:42:27,g8va0w,Couldn't have said it better myself 👌

1333,2020-04-27 02:31:47,g8r813,Can you tell me more?? Christina was once upon a time my favorite character but for some reason I’ve been hesitant to start killing eve.
1334,2020-04-27 07:12:52,g8r813,"I watched all of it in 5 days, it was incredible. After seeing Sandra Oh as Cristina for so long it was almost refreshing to see her in a different role. She definitely does it justice."
1335,2020-04-27 15:42:37,g8r813,"I told my husband we were going to watch Killing Eve and he said no, he didn't want to watch anything new - I can watch it but he won't pay attention. When it started he said ""Oh you just want to watch because it has Sandra Oh in it."" After the first episode he was hooked and we binged both seasons in two days. Now every week he says ""We have to watch Killing Eve!"""
1336,2020-04-27 03:09:19,g8r813,I love Killing Eve.
1337,2020-04-28 19:00:49,g8r813,"It’s a great show, some really dark comedy."
1338,2020-04-30 22:09:47,g8r813,You get Cristina back on the first scene Sandra Oh does in Killing Eve.
1339,2020-04-27 10:32:43,g8r813,I tried watching and couldn’t get into it. Sucks cause I miss seeing Sandra on screen.
1340,2020-04-27 02:59:58,g8r813,"I was also hesitant from the description, but I LOVED it. Season one especially was a masterpiece. 

Basically, Sandra’s character (Eve) is an intelligence agent in the UK that is tasked with finding a serial killer/hit woman. They become obsessed with one another and tracking each other down. The acting is phenomenal, as is the storyline."
1341,2020-04-27 05:16:23,g8r813,The flavor of this show is not really in plot (even though plot is great in first season) but in the way it's delivered. Second lead is phenomenal and you didn't see character like this on tv and Sandra balances her perfectly with more subtle but incredibly nuanced performance.
1342,2020-04-27 04:19:15,g8r813,It’s SO good
1343,2020-04-26 19:58:37,g8e4vl,I love stories too. It's off to a great start. I'm interested and will follow you so I can see when you post.
1344,2020-04-26 20:01:28,g8e4vl,"Thanks very much, go look on my page for the original post (posted to my page), it's slightly updated and I plan to write more there.
I also have more OC erotica as well as sexy pics and fetishes...."
1345,2020-04-25 21:05:39,g80e74,"Imo if you take the whole dan situation out of IOI, it’s a decent season. Definitely not one of the best but it had a pretty good pre-merge, memorable characters (Elaine, Janet, Nora, Dean, Jamal, Kellee) and a decent post merge (besides dan). But unfortunately it will always be in my mind as the most uncomfortable survivor season of all time."
1346,2020-04-25 20:11:44,g80e74,"Tommy, played a good game for the most part but was boring."
1347,2020-04-25 20:15:17,g80e74,Karishma's iconic idol play will never be forgotten
1348,2020-04-25 21:08:18,g80e74,"I just rewatched it.  I never do that this soon normally but I wanted to see it with a little distance.

If it were not for the dan situation and the way it was used by Missy and Elizabeth, it would have been a fun season.  Nowhere near the best but not the worst either.  

But Dan's inability to respect boundaries and those other girls using it as a game move make it pretty despicable.

Elaine and Janet were the only bright spots for me."
1349,2020-04-25 21:16:33,g80e74,"tbh even tho the post merge wasn’t great, i can see this season being the season with the most returnees for the next all star season. jamal. dean. kellee. janet. lauren. elaine. karishma. missy etc. (just like china for HVV & cagayan for SC & koah rong for GC)"
1350,2020-04-25 20:44:46,g80e74,Kellee saved someone that ultimately backstabbed her but her move felt like the most creative move I can remember from that season
1351,2020-04-25 20:12:55,g80e74,I’m rewatching the later seasons right now and have no desire to rewatch that one.
1352,2020-04-25 20:22:14,g80e74,I disagree. IoI wasn’t that forgettable. EoE was easily the most forgettable season for me because of the awful pace and non existent story. Plus nothing even mattered in the end. It was low stakes and boring.
1353,2020-04-25 22:42:53,g80e74,"I remember liking a couple of players, but I don’t remember their names, and none of them were all that likeable."
1354,2020-04-25 23:16:26,g80e74,I remember the pre-merge being really good and a lot of people talking about how overlooking S39 for S40 was a mistake. And then we had possibly the worst post-merge in Survivor history
1355,2020-04-26 01:14:28,g80e74,"I'm in the minority and usually get downvoted for saying anything positive about 39, but aside from the merge episode and Dan getting kicked off it's a solid season.   The premerge was top 10 of all time, finale was stellar too.  Winner was predictable if you know how to read edits, but overall it was an incredibly balanced season, diverse and stellar cast, best crop of women we've had in a while,  and the Rob/Sandra twist was (for the most part) well done."
1356,2020-04-25 21:47:18,g80e74,How can you forget DkChillin aka DkVillain aka Detective Kowalski?
1357,2020-04-25 20:12:08,g80e74,No
1358,2020-04-25 20:17:11,g80e74,"I do, but I’m trying to forget"
1359,2020-04-25 20:29:58,g80e74,I do remember it. But I do think it is one of the more forgetable ones.
1360,2020-04-25 21:59:07,g80e74,I checked out once I realized Rob & Sandra will be in it as Survivor tutors.
1361,2020-04-25 22:00:48,g80e74,If the Dan stuff wasn’t there it would be a solid season
1362,2020-04-25 22:40:31,g80e74,"Only thing “memorable” about it was the incident and the women, and since none of them won I’ll continue sleeping on 39"
1363,2020-04-25 23:07:13,g80e74,"The general opinion when it aired was, the Lairo tribe are kind of a fun mess, wow the Jason boot was great but was an unfair advantage, Kellee played an amazing ploy to give Dean her idol, ohhh that merge episode is horrible and the backlash to the show is unrecoverable, I love Janet, fuck Dan, wow Janet is booted in some bullshit fashion and the boring guy won.

Now everyone has tried to wipe the season from memory. I imagine Probst will not mention it in any future interviews"
1364,2020-04-25 23:10:22,g80e74,Some of my favorites from recent seasons were from last season.  (Janet and Kellee)
1365,2020-04-25 23:17:54,g80e74,"Pre-merge was good but the Dan situation tainted the rest of the season,"
1366,2020-04-25 21:04:10,g80e74,It doesn’t deserve to be remembered
1367,2020-04-25 21:43:06,g80e74,Quite a decent amount of players I would not mind seeing again. Also one of the  best cast of females I can remember too.
1368,2020-04-25 20:18:10,g80e74,Jamal won
1369,2020-04-25 23:39:37,g80e74,I remember how d*n fucking ruined it and discussing what happened as a woman got very devaluing very fast
1370,2020-04-26 01:12:30,g80e74,All I remember is that I either hated everyone or they were bland repeats of old archetypes. Only people I liked were DKChillin and Janet
1371,2020-04-26 01:45:30,g80e74,I think karishma’s underdog story and idol play is the only thing that will be remembered from this season.
1372,2020-04-26 02:08:19,g80e74,"This season had an amazing premerge but unfortunately as soon as the merge came this season was done. Thanks for nothing, Dan"
1373,2020-04-26 04:47:46,g80e74,"Premerge was great and we had some pretty great characters. It's just a huge ""what could have been"" of a season. Imagine if the producers interfered the moment Kellee starts crying in a confessional on they have to ask if she's ok. Or imagine if Kellee plays one of her idols and Dan goes home. She's a hero with a huge target on her back, Dan's an ass and the rest of the season is completely different. The huge cloud the season had hanging over it is removed and people like Elizabeth and Missy don't get as big of a backlash. Tommy might still win but with Dan gone they can show his connections more."
1374,2020-04-26 10:46:26,g80e74,Well with the inappropriate incident added with the hype of Season 40 it ended up just being forgettable. Not including the winner who played a meh winning game.
1375,2020-04-25 20:51:05,g80e74,DK chillin was robbed
1376,2020-04-25 20:47:37,g80e74,Wait! there was a S39?
1377,2020-04-25 20:18:20,g80e74,I have the cast from seasons 38 and 39 all mixed up in my head
1378,2020-04-25 20:16:19,g80e74,I remember Noura and Dean.
1379,2020-04-25 20:15:13,g80e74,I didn't even watch it
1380,2020-04-25 20:33:16,g80e74,"39 is unmemorable compared with a lot of past seasons. It's unfortunate that most people will remember it for having that creep making all the way to the end. But the fact is it's a pretty forgettable season, and I don't think that would change even if they had done the right thing and ejected that fuck right after the merge."
1381,2020-04-26 01:45:03,g80e74,The only one I bothered to remember was DK chillin/villain. Best character from the season imo
1382,2020-04-25 22:30:12,g80e74,">most uncomfortable survivor season of all time

Isn't Worlds Apart up there"
1383,2020-04-25 23:37:49,g80e74,Great name
1384,2020-04-25 20:47:53,g80e74,They probably made him look that way to make him an unobjectionable winner knowing how much flack the season would get. He was pretty much a non-factor in the Kellie and Jamal boots; Tommy later had what sounded like a legitimate F3 deal with Dan and Dean before the former was ejected. That he never visited the season theme of IOI was just the perfect ending for the season too.
1385,2020-04-25 20:15:14,g80e74,Oh yeah. Tommy. Meh.
1386,2020-04-25 22:45:57,g80e74,"Omg so frickin overrated. There’s no skill in playing an idol these days when there’s so goddamn many. And she didn’t even play it right, the closest thing she had to an ally in Elizabeth still went home as she still votes the way the majority told her to vote. They didn’t even care who went home between herself or Elizabeth so she only just helped them along by revealing the idol and then letting Elizabeth go home. An idol is powerful but only if one gets something more out of it, that was her chance to take out Tommy or any of the others but no and as a result she was the next to go. Terrible player imo"
1387,2020-04-25 22:06:43,g80e74,"I doubt Kellie would be back. Maybe not Missy either. The rest, maybe."
1388,2020-04-25 20:58:09,g80e74,Her hiding the idol in her hair is the best part of her idol.
1389,2020-04-26 02:22:50,g80e74,kellee literally said in her exit interview that dean tried to talk to her about this but she blowed it off
1390,2020-04-25 20:50:55,g80e74,"I agree,people just like to hate on IoI because of Dan."
1391,2020-04-26 08:56:48,g80e74,"One World is the most forgettable. Nothing of importance happened post merge and the only memorable things pre merge were the men being idiots and giving up immunity and Colton quitting after being an asshole. EoE at least had Devens and a memorable wtf ending. EoE is the worst season because of that ending, but it's still more memorable than OW. IoI is memorable for a very wrong reason and people will actively try to forget it, so it might surpass OW on this forgettable list."
1392,2020-04-26 12:22:29,g80e74,"Disagree, I love EoE way better than IoI. A lot of positivity comes from that season. I also enjoyed Chris' post season podcast. I hate IoI with a passion, stupid twist, boring cast, nasty incident, just pure negativity. Maybe only Jamal was the only thing positive from that season"
1393,2020-04-25 21:40:06,g80e74,To quote the great John Fincher: “Incorrect”
1394,2020-04-25 20:43:07,g80e74,"If Dan was ejected at the merge, that season would have the potential of being top-tier depending on how everything shakes out. Hell, if Kellee had played an idol who knows what would have happened. But the premerge was great, and most of the cast was pretty good too."
1395,2020-04-25 22:32:52,g80e74,Definitely #2 for me. IOI just is more for me because I was 5 years older and understood what was happening.
1396,2020-04-26 00:31:36,g80e74,Thank you!
1397,2020-04-25 20:49:45,g80e74,"Yeah, I would agree with that."
1398,2020-04-25 22:02:00,g80e74,I find it so funny that the player that won was the one that never went to IoI. Goes to show just how dumb of a twist that was.
1399,2020-04-26 05:44:10,g80e74,"Not just that, Tommy had a ride or die deal with Dan. They were tightly allied. Apparently Dan wanted to be a kingmaker and pick the winner.

Which would actually be an interesting character in a season if he wasnt a creep."
1400,2020-04-25 22:49:51,g80e74,"With the amount of players leaving with idols in their pockets especially on 39, Vince, Chelsea and Kellee. Her play was impressive and was more than what most people did on that season."
1401,2020-04-25 22:59:19,g80e74,"She didn’t play it wrong though. She literally would have gone home if she didn’t play it, and she voted for Janet, not Elizabeth."
1402,2020-04-26 01:43:53,g80e74,"I mean to me it’s iconic solely because of everyone’s reactions.  The looks on everyone’s faces when she stood up was priceless.

In order to be iconic to me, it doesn’t have to be a huge game changing moment, just entertaining television."
1403,2020-04-25 23:39:06,g80e74,Yes to all of this
1404,2020-04-26 10:09:07,g80e74,"I remember a whole lot more from One World because of some of the character moments sprinkled throughout. EoE doesn't do that for me and I often only remember the reactions from the large jury during the awful live tribal segments. IoI has many moments that I remember because of its humor and dramatism. To me, they still bring back feelings I had while watching the first time than EoE which I remember feeling extremely disappointed the most because its flowless narrative."
1405,2020-04-25 22:04:10,g80e74,"Eh, it most likely helped give Sandra and Rob more money to sweeten the deal before WAW."
1406,2020-04-26 06:16:44,g80e74,"Meh, to me kingmaker just sounds like a goat who’s proud of being a goat. I’ll pass regardless of the other crap."
1407,2020-04-25 22:55:13,g80e74,Hardly matters when she wasn’t even able to use it to further advance her game
1408,2020-04-25 23:03:04,g80e74,"I never said she voted for Elizabeth, but by not arranging with Elizabeth or Elaine to vote together she failed to take out any of the majority meaning that someone who was willing to help her was voted out. When she had the capability to really save her game."
1409,2020-04-25 22:07:19,g80e74,"Yeah it was way to set up Winners at War no doubt. If Season 40 was not Winners at War, they would not have done this twist for season 39."
1410,2020-04-25 22:57:52,g80e74,"Omg she did!! Karishma was about to switch up the entire game, she got noura, elaine and dean to form an alliance and go for Tommy, they were going to be the final 4 but dean freaken ruined it :( by betraying them at tribal and telling tommy. It almost worked."
1411,2020-04-25 22:10:03,g80e74,"Yeah, apparently they only had 2 weeks home before going to Fiji again, part of why Sandra was so pissed at Rob. Apparently he acted like he wasn't interested in playing again but she clearly was and they she sees both Rob and Amber there."
1412,2020-04-25 23:00:28,g80e74,"Exactly my point it didn’t work, Elaine has said that if she had known about the idol than she would’ve been on board to take out any of the others. So Karishma really missed a great opportunity to actually change her position in the game.

Dean played the right move and threw them under the bus while also gaining Tommy’s complete trust."
1413,2020-04-25 23:15:00,g80e74,So the right move is not eliminating the biggest target? Playing for second is never the right move.
1414,2020-04-25 23:09:42,g80e74,"If you think Dean made the right move after watching how 39 ended, you don't understand survivor"
1415,2020-04-25 23:18:01,g80e74,"Elaine was seen as a much  bigger threat, and there was no way he would’ve made it to the end with Karishima, Noura and Elaine. Especially after Noura showed how unreliable and inept at strategy when she couldn’t even wrap her head around the 4 of them voting out Tommy"
1416,2020-04-25 23:15:02,g80e74,"Did Karishma make the end? Would those three girls have stayed together? Noura was already very antsy. Would they have brought him to the end? Who do you think had more control in the tribe Tommy or them?

By gaining Tommy’s trust Dean was able to take Lauren’s position as Tommy’s right hand and be in a place of power for the next few tribals, the person Dean wanted to go home went home every time after this, although he didn’t win there was a much less chance of him going to the end with those three.

Who would you pick? Stable and reliable Tommy or unstable and crazy Noura. Along with Karishma who Dean could not get along with and likable Elaine who would beat anyone at the end."
1417,2020-04-25 23:31:17,g80e74,Why wouldn’t he make it to the end with them if he hadn’t spilled the beans? The new alliance of four sticks together. Boom. He makes it to the end. Noura was acting erratic but that’s how she was the entire game.
1418,2020-04-26 00:14:01,g80e74,"Dean's *only* shot at winning was with Noura and Karishma in the finals with him (and even then, he still loses to Noura, according to Janet's AMA).  Dean was a goat, but his arrogance didn't let him realize that and instead made him think he stood a shot against Tommy, so that's who he latched himself onto.  But all that did was guarantee Tommy's win.  Horrible move by Dean."
1419,2020-04-25 23:42:26,g80e74,"Where’s the incentive though? Dean knew that he would lose to either Karishima or Elaine at the end. While with Dan, Tommy, Lauren and Janet, there was a higher likelihood of a final three where he wins. 

He knew he had to get Tommy out and if he had won the last immunity he would’ve sent him against Lauren, and who knows what would’ve happened after that."
1420,2020-04-26 07:37:39,g80e74,"Dean has said he would’ve tried to get rid of Tommy and knew that he would have a hard time beating him. But he was already in a not great position as no matter what he did he would lose against Elaine, Janet or Karishima. 

Dan being kicked from the game effectively ruined Dean’s Chance of winning as he would’ve taken him to the end as everyone knew he has no chance of winning. But because of that he was in the final 5 with Janet and Tommy who he has to get rid of. Unfortunately for Dean unhinged Noura brought Tommy to the end. I can’t say Lauren would’ve bet Tommy in the fire challenge but If he had I can say that Dean would’ve had a much better chance against her as it was him and Tommy controlling the game for the last few votes.

I still believe that Dean could’ve won if he hadn’t screwed himself by contradicting what he had already said during FTC. But as you can see at the final 8 Dean was in a bad position with so many strong competitors, the fact that he made it to the end and did receive 2 Jury votes is a sign of a good game. Not a winning game but still a solid result. 

Also there’s no way Noura would’ve won, she wouldn’t have received Missy, Elizabeth, Aaron or Lauren’s vote. And her FTC performance was one of the worst in a while. If Karishima has made it to the end, she would’ve won, she’s a good speaker and by making it to the end would’ve had a great story."
1421,2020-04-23 21:13:45,g6uqql,"As someone who has observed from the sideline how crazy and creepy her fans on Twitter are, the account suspension is completely justified. She is an incredibly private person evidently and hence does not have to be subjected to creepy tweets and inappropriate behaviour. They weren’t just releasing photos illegally, they are incredibly invasive when it comes to her personal life (sexuality the forefront of this). It is known she has a private Instagram and hence her main one is only work related, and the general public is not entitled to leave their opinions on her pictures (alottt of celebrities eg Ariana Grande have comments turned off). 

I think that people need to get their heads outta their asses and realise that actors are people too and that someone catapulted into such fame as Jodie may actually be uncomfortable about the social media side of it. I know I would be if I had the invasive and out of line fans Jodie does. 

Long story short: Not a diva, just a private person with crazy fans. 

As for not promoting the show that is something that has puzzled me also...it’s possible she is under contract for something else, but you’d think it would be in her KE contract to promote the show"
1422,2020-04-23 21:12:02,g6uqql,Jodie has never given me any bad vibes. She literally hasn’t been on any social media because people have bullied her and violated her privacy. People need to understand that actors are humans with feelings and concerns. I’m actually happy she’s not on any social platforms right now because she’s not taking in all the negativity and toxicity of some of her fans.
1423,2020-04-23 21:08:09,g6uqql,"I came to the KE party late (season 2) and I quickly followed Jodie and the others on their socials, and I have to say, some fans just take things TOO far. Obviously none of us know her personally, but she strikes me as a really private and quite shy person, and she really doesn’t owe anything to any of us. If it were me, being thrust into such a huge spotlight, I’d probably really struggle to cope with having literally thousands of people able to tweet me and comment on my IG. 
Listen to the two podcasts she’s done (they’re on Spotify) and she comes across as so humble and normal, and in MY opinion this is probably just really overwhelming. 
I do wish she’d promote S3, but I hope she’s taking this lockdown time to just chill and be with her family."
1424,2020-04-23 21:25:00,g6uqql,i don’t think someone exercising their fundamental human right to privacy is giving off a ‘weird vibe’ lol
1425,2020-04-23 21:36:59,g6uqql,"This is really interesting to me! I'm an observant person, but I've never had any bad vibes from Jodie. She seems very humble, and shy from interviews I've watched. And she actually does promote S03, but hasn't posted anything about it - just on her IG stories"
1426,2020-04-23 20:58:30,g6uqql,As I  understand from what others have commented on the situation is that some fans are being really creepy and stalking her.

1428,2020-04-23 21:46:04,g6uqql,"I literally did not realize that until is post brought it up. For me personally the show needs no promotion from her. It wouldn’t be crazy to think the production team had some issues behind the scene. The first 2 episodes saw some noticeable dip in quality.

The other thing i noticed is Sean Delaney almost never mentioned anything about S3 production in his Reddit Q&A. Nothing meaningful anyway. Maybe I missed some. But the takeaway for me after reading his replies is he really enjoyed working on S1."
1429,2020-04-23 21:27:59,g6uqql,Yeah I remember people starting to stalk her friends’ accounts and take pics from there? Not cool
1430,2020-04-23 21:14:49,g6uqql,I agree. All interviews I’ve seen of her she always seems to be timid to speak at first but humble.
1431,2020-04-23 21:03:29,g6uqql,"I understand that but that happens with every famous person, but not promoting your show at all? The show that gave you a name a made you an award winning actress...? I don't know, it feels so ungrateful to me. I don't know what's happening with her but she's not handeling in the right way."
1432,2020-04-23 21:16:50,g6uqql,"Just because it happens to a lot of people doesn't make it OK, any non famous person would also avoid being online if people started being creepy about their social media. She has every right to stay away from the spotlight and hope it calms down."
1433,2020-04-23 21:37:17,g6uqql,"It’s not like she can hop on a plane and plug the show on Ellen right now, lmao. She RT’d every teaser when she had twitter and posted a bunch of BTS pics on her insta story leading up to the premiere. And Villanelle isn’t her first role, so KE didn’t “make” her an award winning actress. Her acting did. Just because her life is not immediately accessible to you doesn’t mean she’s ungrateful or a diva."
1434,2020-04-23 21:49:25,g6uqql,"Yes... she's very talented but also is a fact that she became ""famous"" thanks to killing eve and I don't give a fuck about her personal life, I didn't care about her fighting on Twitter with fans or about her Instagram comments, I figured she is a private person and that's ok... but promoting the show that's literally part of her job and she's letting her co star do all the work. That seems unfair to Sandra and immature."

1450,2020-06-24 21:20:00,hf8osz,"In my opinion, a kiss and a relationship are two different things. V and Eve could kiss (and I'd be there for it), but true intimacy is expressed in direct relationships. V kissing Eve, and vice versa, would give us that assurance and representation we crave, but the harder part for the two of them would be in establishing their relationship. Overcoming the hurdles of unconditional and prolonged acceptance while opening up, asking forgiveness, and living the day to day would be more difficult. Either way, I hope the writers will not shy away from the obvious love V and Eve have for one another. It would be a disservice to the viewer and the characters alike."
1451,2020-06-25 01:42:58,hf8osz,"I think them kissing and having some sort of sexual interaction would be the *easiest* thing for them and sure, it’d be nice for the storyline and representation but the real deal to me would be them establishing their relationship and being real about their feelings towards each other. That’s what I wanna see on screen"
1452,2020-06-24 22:08:50,hf8osz,My issue is that if this was a man and a woman the real kiss would have already happened. Physical touching would have already happened. It's only because it's two women that they are being so careful and that's why it bothers me. They couldn't even graze each others hands when their back was turned and they started to walk away. They have avoided any kind of physical affection and its not just for the sake of the story.
1453,2020-06-24 23:44:05,hf8osz,"They are complex people, they have unusual lives, their dynamic is really complicated... But I think we deserve to see they at least try to be something? Like, we all know it’s gonna be really difficult and yadda yadda but imo it’s part of their journey to go through it and accept the outcome, good or bad. And how long can the show go with the sexual tension, great chemistry and no kind of physical display of affection?"
1454,2020-06-24 20:34:46,hf8osz,"I’ve kind of given up listening to the interviews bc both actresses have such a different take on the characters and what they are to each other... and it’s frustrating bc we all want them to admit that yes Villaneve is most definitely a thing. 

In the end it’s gonna be up the the writers in S4... and I have faith their gonna play it out the way that 🗣LITERALLY EVERYONE SEES THEM FOR WHAT THEY ARE... OBSESSED AND IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER...🗣 tysm. 🤡❤️"
1455,2020-06-27 01:47:31,hf8osz,"I really do not stand for calling KE, in any shape or form, querbaiting. Of course, we're all entitled to our opinions but why do people keep commenting on every difficult/vague relationship that it is queerbait. How many films/books/shows are out there about straight relationships going nowhere with unrequited feelings, misunderstood intentions? Anything that is a part of life can be a part of art. Relationships are hard, I can tell you and I have never been in love with a psychopathic assassin. 

I will briefly mention this. These two women have known each other for less than a year. Even if it was a show about a happily-married Eve realizing she has feelings for her neighbour Miss Astankova, I would say, ""Oh, just a few months?"" and she is, again, a psychopathic assassin. It is so much more than wanting to kiss or have sex. Obsession is not as simple as love. Eve said it herself, she wants to know everything about Villanelle, that isn't love, that's obsession. That is in the centre of eveeything in this show. To hell with the 12, Hélène, Dasha, MI6... Two women obsessed with each other. Not in love.

When it comes to what the actors say in the interviews, it's solely their interpretations. Jodie thinks Eve and V turned around, Sandra thinks their relationship has mother-daughter dynamics... Just as you and I have opinions they do too. It is so sad when I see our lovely cast and crew having to defend themselves for having ideas. I am afraid especially poor Jodie might have somewhat of a bitter taste after the show is over about this. Can't blame her, it would get to anyone's head.

My last few words will be about queerbaiting in general and I know most people will disagree with me. I don't think we're owed anything. They're just trying to write a story about two people and art is a reflection of reality. When Villanelle shot Eve, I thought, ""Waow, this is a good show."" They could've backed up and given us a kiss or an ""oh ok now we love each other"". No. Whrn she shot her, I thought about my ex, how I was pushed away by him and yes, I also thought I was owed love or at least compassşon like Villanelle but sometimes it just doesn't work. I would prefer to see one solid, real, deep and maybe never happy story about two women than a hundred fake ones with a clear cut ""this is romantic""."
1456,2020-06-24 21:22:52,hf8osz,"Carolyn and eve are a what to villanelle?

Edit: sandra oh just did an interview where she said “sexual tension” and “mother-daughter” in the same sentence.... i cant i cant what in the incest shit is this 😂😂"
1457,2020-06-25 02:07:39,hf8osz,"I think a kiss will be inevitable in S4... Weve just been waiting for Eve to catch up mentally. V knows she’s not quite there yet and has to sort through a ton of feelings. V touched E quite a bit in S2, with the bread roll, and the post threesome chat. She’s already made all her moves. E is just slow as fuck. Guys, it’s coming next season. I believe it."
1458,2020-06-28 02:49:13,hf8osz,"As a woman, this show is giving me “blue balls” lmao. The sexual tension between Eve and V is wild. Eve seems like such a prude, which definitely plays into this. Like, a kiss isn’t going to cut it for me, these ladies need to love on each other. It’s so close, after the whole “threesome” thing, I thought it would sure happened by the end of Season 3."

1460,2020-06-24 21:52:10,hf8osz,"well i mean it's not obligatory to be a couple and settle down. They can love, being obsessed and have a relationships, just not in the way Eve and Niko did. I want to see it. They both already acknowledged they have all those feelings, why can't they kiss, have sex? I don't see how that's impossible.
As for actors, i think they've been avoiding words ""romance"" and ""love"" and used ""obsession"" only, because it was like that in s1. S2 was not clear because we had Villanelle's obsessive""you're mine"" and Eve's regection - there's no respect and love in that. S3 finale gave us a completely new perspective."
1461,2020-06-24 21:28:38,hf8osz,Yes. That's why I'm talking about a kiss. I understand why they can't be in a relationship. They can show us  many romantic scenes like in  the ballroom or the bridge  but if a kiss that directly express they're love is a representation that we will painfully miss or need. They don't need a label they just need to express love directly.
1462,2020-06-25 02:59:54,hf8osz,Beautifully put.
1463,2020-06-25 01:50:45,hf8osz,Yes I understand that but that seems not to be possible. And the easiest thing it hasn't been easy. If they can just kiss and embrace they're love for a moment do you think a relationship can happen?
1464,2020-06-25 03:05:25,hf8osz,I really don’t think the lack of physical intimacy has anything to do with their sexuality. V has already kissed a one in season 1 when she was in Germany. V is a psychopath and so physical intimacy means very little to her. Finding a place to belong (acceptance) and trust are what she is looking for. Physical intimacy would mean nothing to V. I what everyone wants is for their relationship ( I wouldn’t call it a romance either because again V is a psychopath) means something to V. We already know that Eve (though in denial) has already showed this when she tried to save her.
1465,2020-06-24 23:19:50,hf8osz,Couldn’t agree more. They have such an issue with it that they make them act like two teenagers around each other sometimes. They are grown up adults and should act like such. I’ve seen people give in into physical attraction for much less.
1466,2020-06-24 22:31:57,hf8osz,Spot on
1467,2020-06-24 21:07:36,hf8osz,"Idk I feel like they both acknowledge it is a “thing” and how important they are to eachother ....they just tend to also comment on how things would work as a legitimate relationship and I feel like that is sooooo much more complicated. 

Could villanelle cope with a relationship which would perhaps require more than she’s able to give emotionally? Would she become frustrated with it and lash out? Would she be content with the idea of settling down? 

And for Eve would she want something more “normal”? Would she feel herself suppressing elements of villanelle’s personality to achieve something more comfortable relationship wise? Would she find things different without the thrill of the hunt and the cat/mouse of it all? 

There’s a lot of consideration and also I think they tend to answer from within their character’s headspace where there probably is a bit of a knee jerk reflex reaction about them perhaps needing to grow more as people individually before you’d even consider what they have a relationship..... or there’s the POV of analysis (like this comment haha where you realise how complicated it is and how tentative they are about replying ..... I think also as actors they’re probably not in a position to speculate because they don’t know where the writers will go next) There’s a lot of analysis vs an emotional response from viewers who ship them and/or want more representation and are bringing that into things."
1468,2020-06-24 22:07:02,hf8osz,"V has mommy issues so I can see why she has an attraction to an older woman like Eve but they can't have it both ways. Either she sees Eve as a lover (which is the direction I'm sure the writers are going in, especially after s3) or she sees Eve as a mother figure (which is just gross considering she told Eve in s1 she masturbates about her alot lmao)."
1469,2020-06-24 21:32:33,hf8osz,Hahaha yes. Villanelle masturbates thinking about her mother figure a lot.
1470,2020-06-25 00:01:43,hf8osz,"No I didn’t take it Sandra saying it’s like an incest type thing. V suffers from a real deprivation of nurturing And acceptance from her mother and speaking from experience of going through the same thing, I often struggled in my relationship with a woman of keeping those strong feelings of needing nurturing and fearing abandonment into my relationship. I never wanted her to mother me in the traditional way but I did often seek out more nurturing. It’s unhealthy but it it was something I had to work on."
1471,2020-06-25 02:30:12,hf8osz,"To be fair, women admit to being attracted to certain men because they have daddy issues all the time. So it's possible to have those dynamics while also having sexual and romantic attraction."
1472,2020-06-24 22:22:05,hf8osz,Lol and Eve kissed V on the bus too!
1473,2020-06-24 21:54:16,hf8osz,"I've never heard them saying Eve is a mother figure tho, what the fuck?"
1474,2020-06-24 21:32:07,hf8osz,I agree with that. It's a shame that something so natural and intimate as a kiss can still be so controversial and divisive.
1475,2020-06-25 01:56:03,hf8osz,"I meant the easiest thing moving forward. I don’t think the story had gone to the point where they could do either of those things (a kiss, sex scene) without it feeling too out of character (I remember PWB saying the S1 finale had a lot more intimate moments between them but were cut out bc it didn’t felt like it was the right thing to do at the moment). Season 4 has a blank page on where they can take their relationship— and I wouldn’t be surprised if they end up getting close physically first before emotionally"
1476,2020-06-25 07:03:05,hf8osz,"Thank you! I just wanted to say the same thing. Some people can't see through the querbait issue and think that this is the reason the writers haven't brought them together yet. They are not afraid of anything, Jodie just stuck her tongue in a woman's throat in the first ep lol. IMO it wouldn't have happened either if they were man and woman. Their relationship is much more complex than that. I really appreciated the bus kiss and was very glad that there wasn't any kissing on the bridge. Honestly, the scene was much more romantic and hot that way."
1477,2020-06-24 23:57:12,hf8osz,"I had thought a lot about the lack of physical affection except the kiss. To me, I think both are afraid to take the plunge when it comes to crossing the line into intimacy, meaning more than just a kiss during the middle of enraged Eve episode. I think there is a fear that Villanelle would be showing her vulnerability when it comes to fully giving herself to Eve that way and Eve being nervous about being with a woman for the first time. It made sound corny but I feel like Villanelle has had tons of sex but most of it without meaning and she likely is the dominant one in the act. I think sleeping with Eve would be scary for her because there are feelings attached to it. And maybe would it ruin things with Eve once that sexual tension was resolved to a degree. It would be different for Eve and Eve aside from Hugo, has only been with Niko during her chase of Villanelle, so there is some hesitation to give herself to Villanelle that way simply because it’s new to her and worry it could change Villanelle’a feelings towards her."
1478,2020-06-25 02:32:09,hf8osz,They take the lesbian yearning stuff too seriously 😭
1479,2020-06-24 22:31:58,hf8osz,"Mother-daughter don’t do... whatever they’re doing rn lolol. But anyways, she said other nice things too, its just that M figure word that took me out 😂"
1480,2020-06-24 22:06:48,hf8osz,Poor Sandra is just as much in denial as Eve was lol
1481,2020-06-24 22:36:58,hf8osz,"https://youtu.be/y0B4B4TkE3Q  
Executive Producer Gina Mingacci  says this about Eve and Carolyn's relationship with Villanelle."
1482,2020-06-25 10:37:27,hf8osz,"I completely agree! Their relationship is anything but normal and the bus scene was a perfect way of representing the development of their relationship. First emotion of the scene, V is curious and Eve is then scared. Second emotion,  Eve’s fear becomes anger and V’s is shocked. Then they fight. Finally, V just wants to show Eve she is dominant with her scent and Eve shows her how little power she has when she kisses her and V is then paralyzed with confusion. People tend to forget V is a psychopath and Eve is a “psychopath expert” this is the reason Carolyn hired her. This is why Eve struggles with having feelings someone who (would be defined by most) lacks empathy. Season 3 (in my opinion) was meant to give V complexity so that the bridge screen could happen. Though she is a killing machine she can feel things such as a sense of belonging and trust. The bridge is symbolic of their union. They can no longer fight their connection. That scene was so much more intimate than any kiss could have been."
1483,2020-06-25 02:09:02,hf8osz,Yes! Their kiss won’t just be a kiss. They’ll be fully giving themselves to one another and that’s terrifying for both. Also their relationship is so precious to them. I don’t think either want to do something to jeopardize it or make it awkward.
1484,2020-06-25 02:37:28,hf8osz,"I agree. I think to immediately force intimacy into them would have cheapen the act. Villanelle is someone who probably has meaningless sex all the time, and take issues with people inappropriately touching her (not eve ofc), meanwhile eve has never been with a woman before (that we know of), and had a husband (though I would argue that she already emotionally cheat on her husband haha) Now that he’s out of the way... maybe we can get on with it? 👀"
1485,2020-06-25 02:39:43,hf8osz,Agree
1486,2020-06-24 22:22:33,hf8osz,Hahaha exactly
1487,2020-06-24 22:39:25,hf8osz,i just 🙈🙉💀
1488,2020-06-25 04:32:12,hf8osz,"When you connect with someone on such a deep level, sometimes there is much more intimacy attached to that then the actual act of sleeping with them. To me, it’s just icing on the cake for them to experience that. It’s more sexy to me for Eve and Villanelle to sit down and bare their souls to one another. The ballroom scene is a perfect example of that. That was pure sex to me without the act. The way they held each other and how V nuzzles into Eve.  And the head lean when they are back to back on the bridge. Makes my heart flutter thinking about it. Don’t get me wrong though, I still wish for them to take things to the next level but baby steps."
1489,2020-06-25 04:58:03,hf8osz,Baby steps... 3 seasons already aired
1490,2020-06-25 11:59:12,hf8osz,"Yes, it has been a long wait but they are two very complex people and Eve has taken awhile to come to terms with how she feels. It they would have slept together at this point to me it would have been meaningless."
1491,2020-06-25 22:55:51,hf8osz,That's why I'm not talking about sex. But the intimacy of a real kiss.
1492,2020-06-24 15:28:24,hf2whw,">“As my authorship of my own work has grown,” says Oh, “I’ve been trying to infuse more pieces of my character’s ethnicity and cultural background. Like at the very top of Season 3 in ‘Killing Eve,’ you see Eve in New Malden \[outside central London\], which is actually the largest gathering of Koreans outside of Korea. I wanted it to be set in a place where Eve could try to disappear for a while. It was just a small bit of the show, but I wanted to bring the flavor of that because we carry our culture, we carry our history. And typically, white Hollywood does not write it. Does not write our culture, does not write the depth of our culture.

> “I remember talking to the sound people, it’s like, ‘Hey guys, you are layering in the sound of me wearing shoes in the house. I don’t wear shoes. My character doesn’t wear shoes. I know you don’t see the feet. But don’t layer in the sound of shoes in the house, because that doesn’t happen,’” she adds. “But maybe these people, mostly white English dudes, don’t know that. It’s something that you might not even think is important, but it is because that’s how we start building the nuance of a character.” 

I haven't watched S3 yet, but I've heard that [the writers really dropped the ball in writing Eve](https://twitter.com/e_alexjung/status/1265045818274390017) :/

Still, I commend Sandra Oh for her efforts to bring greater nuance to the representation of her character!"

1494,2020-06-24 14:34:58,hf2258,">Talking about his view on Asian representation in the film, \[John Cho\] said, “It’s hard to find things that don’t represent Asian culture, especially family dynamics, as something that’s not oppressive or is attached to shame or all filial piety or doing things that you don’t want to do. This story is about an Asian family that is rooted in love. And that to me that’s what differentiates it. That’s what gives it its heart. And I love that about this film.”"
1495,2020-06-24 20:26:20,hf2258,"Not to take away from ""Over the Moon,"" but I found ""Coco"" to capture Asian family dynamics so much that I was surprised it didn't have Asian writers."

1497,2020-06-25 01:20:12,hf2258,"Honestly, I can't wait to see this film. From the trailer alone, it looks like it has a lot of heart put into it!"
1498,2020-06-25 13:27:51,hf2258,"Am I the only one who had the version of this story being NOT a love story? I'm super conflicted about this. Because the story I know is basically a domestic violence/escape story.

like...Qixi would have been a better love story? still involves traveling to the skies and stuff."
1499,2020-06-24 19:47:36,hf2258,So excited 🥰
1500,2020-06-24 15:49:40,hf2258,"John Cho says so many amazing things. I also loved this quote:

>the film is so unique at this time right now when I just feel like as a planet, we’re struggling with our capacity for empathy and understanding each other as human beings. And to have that connection to this character who was experiencing grief, this little girl who was experiencing the greatest grief you could possibly imagine, for me that’s the experience of watching this movie and having participated in a small way. It was an exercise in understanding our common humanity."
1501,2020-06-24 21:44:31,hf2258,"This is very refreshing to hear. I can't begin to count how many times ""shame to the family"" has been central plot to an Asian character. It's not even a trope! It's almost like a prerequisite to being an Asian character."
1502,2020-06-24 21:03:06,hf2258,Another great movie that I need to watch!
1503,2020-06-24 21:13:58,hf2258,Am missing something? Coco is about a Mexican family no?
1504,2020-06-25 02:49:40,hf2258,Definitely not like my family. He wasn’t pressured into becoming a doctor or a lawyer even once.

1507,2020-06-24 23:57:13,hf2258,"Not u/InsertCoinForCredit, but I thought the same thing.

Non-white culture and family is more similar to each other than to white cultural dynamics (which get even more nuanced and differentiated with American white culture, which has problematic capitalistic values usually baked in)."
1508,2020-06-24 21:47:39,hf2258,"Yes, but the family dynamics seemed very Asian to me. I think it shows that different cultures can have similar traits."

1512,2020-06-24 04:50:15,heu7tm,"Tom, Steph, and Colby were targeted because they weren't a part of the major pregame alliance on the Heroes, not because they were threats"
1513,2020-06-24 04:37:29,heu7tm,Agreed.
1514,2020-06-24 04:49:06,heu7tm,"I didn't realize how bad GC was while it was airing. I was in 7th grade and just a casual at the time also. If it aired today I think I'd be pissed watching it. Four of the six biggest names were all taken out pre-merge, Ozzy and Cirie being the two that survived."
1515,2020-06-24 07:08:50,heu7tm,"All-Stars would be an incredible season if you flipped the bootlist upside down.

&#x200B;

though really the measure of bias on these returnee seasons is how balanced the casting is.  Game Changers had such questionable casting choices who were of course gonna be out for blood against the bigger names.  While All-Stars' three tribe makeup naturally zeroes in on the bigger threats letting the c-list cast take over on all fronts. (which, let me say again, NEVER do 3 tribes for a full returnee season unless you want the big names gone early)"
1516,2020-06-24 04:48:53,heu7tm,"Granted I’m a Parv stan but I think there’s a big bias against her even on WAW that arguably rivals Rob/Sandra. Most of her tribe had confessionals speaking about her like she’s some mythical charmer you can’t let yourself be tempted by. 

I think her reputation precedes herself; the fear of “getting got” or “trapped” by her has genuinely eluded her ability to form loyal alliances with some people. I.e. she has a bond with Adam, but look how adamantly he pushes to turn Denise against her and only want to play with the male OSers because “she’s dangerous”. How Michele/Natalie feared playing with her even though they were super drawn to her. 

I feel players like Rob/Sandra/Tony/Tyson/Yul/Sarah got a bigger pass because they’re known entities to some extent—you get what you get with them and they seem more easily “pegged”. Yet that hysteria over Parvati that was prevalent on the Villains/HvV merge tribe still didn’t seem to go away on WaW. I think it’s just her presence out there, she’s got powerful stuff but when everyone’s seen it multiple times.. people want to run the other way. Put her on a cast of more malleable players and she probably runs the game, hell she only went out here due to a swap screw to the Yul pregame tribe. The fear is real because she is that good, nobody gives her a pass while I think other big names get one."
1517,2020-06-24 06:24:14,heu7tm,"NO , i think game changers is gotta be #1

tony , malcolm , sandra all went to pre merge and 

even ozzy voted out early merge

and all winners voted out pre merge 

game changers is terrible season"
1518,2020-06-24 09:24:33,heu7tm,"Yeah in the final 7 you had 2 winners, 3 runners up and Rupert, still at the time extremely popular"
1519,2020-06-24 07:13:30,heu7tm,"Yeah, that two former winners made it to the final 3 kinda negates the bias argument for HvV. Tom/Colby/Steph were targeted not for being threats but because of previous relationships within the Heroes tribe."
1520,2020-06-24 15:44:08,heu7tm,"Who did this “major pregame alliance” consist of, exactly?

Cirie had concerns about aligning with Amanda again."
1521,2020-06-24 05:01:57,heu7tm,True. Although their names definitely didn’t help.
1522,2020-06-24 06:28:16,heu7tm,"yeah , game changers was just terrible 

only ozzy and cirie goes to merge and all winner and malcolm went to pre merge"
1523,2020-06-24 07:20:24,heu7tm,"Agreed but I'd argue Aubry was a big name that season too and she got to day 37. 

Tony/JT played themselves out, Sandra and Malcolm were screwed by a swap or weird tribal format."
1524,2020-06-24 14:15:42,heu7tm,"Tina winning All Stars? Hell yeah, it would be great
I think outside of the actual two-time winners, Tina was the one who deserved to be a two time winner too more than anyone"
1525,2020-06-24 05:05:32,heu7tm,"I mean you just said in your last sentence she was swap screwed to a pregame alliance....which kinda negates your entire thesis that people were always out to get her this past season. 

Granted she did have a big threat coming in. Her, Rob, and Sandra were considered the “big 3”, but on paper she had the best chance of those 3."
1526,2020-06-24 10:23:56,heu7tm,"Malcolm was screed by a twist and JT tbh, and Sandra was swap-screwed. Tony overplayed. JT screwed himself in more ways than 1. At least they were given a little breathing and the cards just didn’t fall in their favor. 

All-Stars was a witch hunt where they wouldn’t stop resting until all the winners were out, and they were also, like game changers, all voted out premerge. And Rob C as well, the next biggest threat there."
1527,2020-06-24 15:53:40,heu7tm,"People also forget that Cirie had doubts about aligning with Amanda.

Tom was known for playing one of the best games of all time even right after 2000’s JTmania, so of course he was a massive, massive threat. As for Steph, she dug her own grave."
1528,2020-06-24 15:54:27,heu7tm,"JT, Amanda, Rupert, James, Cirie"
1529,2020-06-24 06:34:16,heu7tm,Probably not. Steph said she knew her game was over as soon as the tribes were divided.
1530,2020-06-24 15:16:57,heu7tm,Aubry was a big name but the other six were on another level.
1531,2020-06-24 21:21:50,heu7tm,"although it's hard to imagine Tina winning over Rudy if he made the final 2, it's probably a really close vote."
1532,2020-06-24 05:19:34,heu7tm,"Doesn’t negate it, she’s a great player and always manages to make do with what she can get. But I think it’s in the way people talk about her vs Rob/Sandra. 

To me it deals with the layer of misogyny a bit. I feel players, guys especially, have a warped perception of who she is and are genuinely scared to give her a chance. Whereas with Rob/Sandra, the avenues they have seem less closed off (at least from the edit). Ben speaks of Rob like The Godfather and only grapples with him over who can be the tribe leader. Yet he immediately pegs Parvati as trouble for smiling and “batting her eyes” as though she isn’t a married mother. There’s definitely a gender bias that I feel she gets plagued with more-so than the other big name players. Without a doubt she’s top 3 targets on WAW and that trio you named had no shot without massive luck. So there’s still a “big threat” group here imo."
1533,2020-06-24 16:17:48,heu7tm,"Not alliance that was formed during the game. 
When did they decide to align pregame? We’re all five of them bffs before they hit the beach?

I need more evidence of all five of these connections (except Amanda and James) being as strong as you claim, otherwise this 10 year old rumor (that everyone uses as an excuse to why their faves lost) needs to be put tf to rest.

Because Cirie saying “I don’t understand why everyone thinks we’re so tight. Amanda chose Parvati.” contradicts that."
1534,2020-06-24 15:50:41,heu7tm,"I also call bs on this. It’s nobody else’s fault she was an early boot, especially when she let her mouth and ego take over at the immunity challenge and didn’t admit it. That certainly didn’t help her get on JT’s good side.

Why is Amanda a bad guy for not catering to Steph, yet it’s ok for Steph to target her pretending she’s the weakest when a guy with a broken toe was on their team? It wasn’t the first time Steph was threatened by a strong women."
1535,2020-06-24 21:23:55,heu7tm,"I can see that .w. I think in that scenario, Rudy probably wins, he had got close to winning, Tina had already won, although it would be cool to see Tina winning, would be super surprising"
1536,2020-06-24 07:29:24,heu7tm,"Agreed 100%.  In HVV I think she wins if she isnt a guy, as she likely gets more respect for moves rather than being seen as Russell's girl and doesnt deal with jealous girl bs. 

Also, young smart attractive women are commonly seen as scarier threats now directly due to her Micro and HVV games.  Being branded Parvati 2.0 is a death sentence.  Same cant be said for people doing their best Tony impression or anyone playing the ""anyone but me"" card."
1537,2020-06-24 15:55:20,heu7tm,Are you trying to act like there were no pregame alliances?
1538,2020-06-24 16:10:51,heu7tm,"People “try to act like” Steph (mostly) is always the victim who had no control over her placement. Wouldn’t be the first season people made excuses for her losing.

Cirie says multiple times “I don’t know why everyone thinks we’re so tight, Amanda chose Parvati.” Steph’s inability to be a team player in the challenge and afterwards is 100% on her.

No one gives Tom and Steph a hard time for being friends irl (the Palau cast has always been pretty close). But whoever votes against them is a bad evil bully. Why is it ok for Tom and Steph to be friends outside of the game and work together, but not ok for Amanda and James to be friends and work together? Serious question.

But to be fair, Tom was a massive threat and had a massive bullseye on his back for playing one of the best games of all time. I don’t understand why people are shocked that he didn’t make the jury."
1539,2020-06-24 01:31:50,heri9t,"I like the actress. My dislike of Izzie has nothing to do with the actress. It's the same with Kevin. He's a brilliant actor, but I don't like Owen as a character."
1540,2020-06-24 10:38:46,heri9t,"I don't dislike Katherine Heigl, I've seen a fair bit of her in tv and movies but I definitely wouldn't call her an amazing actress. She has pretty much typecast herself because her acting hasn't changed much from role to role. Life As we Know It and Knocked Up basically even have the same scene in it with the car. If you showed me a short clip it would be hard distinguishing her as Izzie from any other character that she's played."
1541,2020-06-24 04:20:55,heri9t,"From my perspective, Sandra and Katherine carried the show to success. There are more fine actresses on the show but as part of MAGIC they were most responsible for its fame. Maybe Chandra too"
1542,2020-06-24 09:44:19,heri9t,"A few years ago Justin Chambers mentioned some of his favourite stuff to play and they all involved Heigl. He had very nice words about her as an actress and a professional, which struck me because I'd got used to the opposite discourse. I do believe she's good. I think part of the reason Izzie is such a polarising character is in the fact that Heigl's acting is so believable."
1543,2020-06-24 03:43:37,heri9t,"Respectfully, I just don't see it. Was never a fan even before the whole award debacle and fall out with SR."
1544,2020-06-24 04:18:34,heri9t,"Not for me. She has that horrible exaggerated breathy 90s teen drama style with very little subtlety.

She can do big. She could probably do well in theater but I don't think it very nuanced."
1545,2020-06-24 01:26:00,heri9t,i have to agree!!
1546,2020-06-24 02:45:33,heri9t,I love Katherine and I love Izzie... everyone knows she’s horrible to work with but my god do I love her acting. One of my all time favs
1547,2020-06-24 03:15:44,heri9t,I don’t like her as a person though
1548,2020-06-24 06:17:05,heri9t,"Yes KH is a very good actress, she is very talented and has worked consistently since leaving Greys."
1549,2020-06-24 08:05:22,heri9t,"Yes! I agree too, I love her acting!"
1550,2020-06-24 08:34:19,heri9t,"I think it's funny that Izzie used to be a fan favorite back in the day when she was still on the show and now everyone hates her charactets...

But I agree with the post. Her acting is really great!"
1551,2020-06-24 04:29:43,heri9t,She is such an awful person though. She is a diva and left Grey's when she did because she wanted to do movies because she thought she'd be a much bigger star. Her ego got in the way and she left so quickly that the plot line for Izzie and Alex deteriorated for no good reason. And guess what? Her career stagnated because her acting is only a typecast of Izzie and she can't break free of that because she isn't even that good of an actress. If she'd stayed on Grey's and learned to reign her ego in she'd be worth much more than she is today.
1552,2020-06-24 05:36:02,heri9t,I agree! Ellen was also great in the first seasons in my opinion
1553,2020-06-24 03:01:04,heri9t, I wonder tho if she’s so horrible to work with how she’s consistently been working in the industry.
1554,2020-06-24 09:37:30,heri9t,"She's not horrible to work with, not all actors get along on set.. Seth Rogen was mad at her because she didn't like his film that she starred in. And Grey's ""ruined"" her reputation for speaking her mind about the lame material she got to work with. I praise her for that, she was ahead of her time. Male actors (Ryan Reynolds Green Lanter, for example) diss their movies and everyone aplauds. Heigl did it and Hollywood started hating her."
1555,2020-06-25 05:14:19,heri9t,I loved the first seasons of Izzie. At the end they ruined her character imo. I hate when Greys ruins characters before they leave
1556,2020-06-24 04:37:47,heri9t,"What is a diva tho? I feel like it’s mostly used for women who stand up for themselves. I find it also weird that this is mostly only said about Katherine Heigl  and not about other actors which haven’t been on big TV either after greys. Leaving Greys doesn’t neccesarily mean your career “stagnated”, there’s a lot of different circumstances and priorities. For example I’m sure that Patrick is way happier now in what he’s doing. 
I would like to explain myself better but English isn’t my first language and I haven’t slept haha.. but this just looks like hate without any basis"
1557,2020-06-24 10:43:51,heri9t,"I pretty much said this before seeing your comment. She's always the same character, no matter the story. Her acting hasn't changed much since she first started."
1558,2020-06-24 06:53:43,heri9t,"The diva things came after she said that the ghost story wasn't worth an Emmy (Yes) and that Judd Apatow movie was sexist (Judd Apatow seems to don't care now, so...). 
Is it unprofessional? Yes. Untrue? No.

It has been 10 years. The rumors always have been that she was horrible because she was blunt with the writers and the producers, but nice with the teams. I don't know, it isn't the place of the actors, but... Why not stand up when the script is wrong? I would be happy if someone was telling to Krista Vernoff that she could do better with GA right now. 

 Katherine Heigl isn't probably as bad as what you think. It is always like that, we think that a person is bad and years after you learn that it was nothings, just the producer that wasn't happy that someone was telling what they think."
1559,2020-06-24 10:32:58,heri9t,She couldn't know at the time that she wouldn't get big roles in films. An actress' shelf life is very short so I can see why she could have gotten a little anxious about being chained to a years-long television show in the same role. It's time people stop blaming Katherine Heigl for making a move that she thought would be better and maybe more exciting for her career. It's not like she could see the future.
1560,2020-06-24 04:54:33,heri9t,[deleted]
1561,2020-06-24 05:43:20,heri9t,She had very good moments and was way better than now imo. Although the episode where she cannot speak is very good.
1562,2020-06-24 04:18:04,heri9t,I think her bluntness got her blacklisted but she is no worse than some other actors.
1563,2020-06-24 10:28:14,heri9t,"Some male actors have probably had worse attitudes than her and didn't get hit with the ""difficult to work with"" label."
1564,2020-06-24 11:56:40,heri9t,"Grey's didn't ruin her reputation. It got ruined after she burned bridges with a lot of higher ups, she may not be a diva or difficult to work with but she did messed up her relationship with producers because all of her interviews and as result it costed her career.

Actors do diss their projects but most of the time is once they have an established career and look back, Katherine did it when she was still building her career and even while she was currently on said project."
1565,2020-06-25 05:32:47,heri9t,Yes they do that a lot. Always really annoys me about Grey's.
1566,2020-06-24 04:41:11,heri9t,Pretty sure she has thrown things at people and refused to come out on set for small reasons. It's well known in the industry that people don't like to work with her. You don't hear that about every woman. You hear that about specific actors and actresses who act like God hand delivered them as his gift to mankind. They don't say that about Sandra Oh or any of the other women who left Grey's.
1567,2020-06-24 04:48:59,heri9t,"Here's an article with a small list of things but there are tons of articles and tons of material if you are interested in looking it up.

1568,2020-06-25 05:11:37,heri9t,"Just found this interview and i have decided to stan. She was really portrayed as a ""diva"" for standing her ground [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8UOMatNK1o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8UOMatNK1o)"
1569,2020-06-24 06:03:03,heri9t,"She got some projects but after those scandals her career never recovered.

The tv shows she was starring were cancelled after the pilot and the movies flopped (one of them literally made $0) is quite known she was 'black listed' but not 100%. 

She is doing better with Suits and that netlfix project."
1570,2020-06-24 04:55:27,heri9t,"She even said herself she was an asshole and then dismissed it by saying, ""Everyone is an asshole in their 20's lol"" instead of taking responsibility.

1572,2020-06-24 04:53:30,heri9t,I’ve also heard amazing things about Sandra Oh i love her!! And yeah that may be possible. I don’t know a lot about katherine Heigl and the interviews that I’ve watched look normal to me and not arrogant or something like that but of course i don’t know it’s not like I’ve worked with her. I found interesting that even Ellen said that the cast was toxic the first 10 seasons and even she thought about leaving ....and that’s actually what Katherine did so.. She also was the one who slammed Isaiah Washington for being homophobic so I had always the idea that she had just an apologetic personality which is normally portrayed as “diva” in the media
1573,2020-06-24 05:28:11,heri9t,Thank you! I prefer not to base my opinion on media articles written to cause drama though.. I know she had trouble with another producer for calling the show sexist which I think is extremely valid and would’ve been seen different if it would’ve happened in the last 5 years

1577,2020-06-24 11:02:38,heri9t,I don't understand where people got the idea that things have changed so much in the last 5 years.  They haven't.  Things have been pretty good since the 80's.  I'm sure you've seen the saying about Hard times make great men.  Great men make easy times.  Easy times make soft men.  Soft men make hard times.  I believe the same thing can be said about women's rights.  When women have rights many choose to focus on their children.  When women aren't in the work force it becomes harder to be a woman in the work force.  When work becomes hard women fight for their rights.  and when they are secure in their rights they choose to raise their own children.  What I'm saying is that we are on the second cycle of this in my lifetime. Hopefully the next round will see more women who have raised their children and returned to work making it easier for the ones 25 years younger to make their careers work for them.
1578,2020-06-24 05:07:22,heri9t,She literally works for her mom on her latest TV show.
1579,2020-06-24 05:08:08,heri9t,And yet she’s been in so many works besides her latest. That doesn’t mean anything.

1581,2020-06-24 05:24:09,heri9t,"Yeah it’s weird to me that people say her career stagnated. She’s actually one of the only ones that I recognize from other shows and are not bound to their greys character anymore! Also she has kids and I don’t believe any actor/actress that has left Greys consider it as failing, they probably have different priorities"
1582,2020-06-24 05:28:18,heri9t,"And how many of those projects have been top level projects? You can't compare her success during Grey's, Knocked Up, 27 Dresses, and even Killers(top movies) to her recent movies that tank at the box office or her several TV shows that were prematurely canceled. The most successful movies she's done since 2014 have been cartoon movies(The Nut Job & TNJ2) and aside from Suits she hasn't been in any award winning TV shows. She's done things, but she isn't getting the caliber of scripts she should be getting for someone who starred in the things from her early career, except Suits."
1583,2020-06-24 06:06:16,heri9t,"Back in the day she was getting quite popular for her romcoms, after the the Emmy thing and the Knocked up thing in went downhill for her, right now her career is doing a bit better and she has been coming back."

1587,2020-06-24 05:38:34,heri9t,Those were all prior to her leaving Grey's. She left Grey's for Killers.

1591,2020-06-24 19:38:31,hemi2d,Did anyone get the Rashomon reference and cares to explain?
1592,2020-06-24 22:10:18,hemi2d,"Is a movie where they recount the same murder from different perspectives.

I guess she means that's kind of what happens on those contracts negotiations and why is complicated."
1593,2020-06-25 00:13:41,hemi2d,"Oh so maybe she means that everyone will remember these situations from their perspective and it’s hard to talk about what really happened cause it’d be the typical “she said, he said” problem"
1594,2020-06-25 00:18:37,hemi2d,"Yep, I think it was about that. 

There are also many people involved lawyers, agents, etc so it makes it a bit complicated too."

1661,2020-06-19 11:31:39,hbydm9,"1) To her point at the end, she's so right. Growing up with diversity in race and culture does wonders for expanding a persons outlook.

I grew up in the south, attending a magnet elementary and middle school, and a technology focused high school, all three of which were very diverse in who attended (white, black, indian, hispanic). I still communicate with people from those days and it's striking how differently my self and these old classmates view and treat the world versus those who were raised in a box where they were only around one race/culture for the majority of their lives.

2) I get exactly what she's getting at. Any non-black person ever notice something different about the casting in Jordan Peele's films? If you do, then try noticing how ""normal"" it is for movies that don't rely on a specified race for any of the roles, to still somehow end up nearly entirely white, all the way to the extras in the background. This is what happens when you're raised in the box. Consider the fact that Hollywood is largely run by those people...and now that is mostly what we get in bigger movies.

Hollywood has even been bold enough to cast characters who aren't even white in the source material, with white actors/actresses...does nothing seem odd about that? God's of Egypt, Ghost In The Shell, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, Batman Begins (Ras Al Ghul), Doctor Strange (Ancient One), Exodus: Gods and Kings, etc"

**Favorite song**  
Difficult to choose but I'm going to say *When a Woman Is Around* by Unloved which plays when V arrives in Tuscany. I just can't pick a song that is not from Unloved because their music is so ingrained in the show, and this song just gives me serious ""Villanelle is a bad-ass"" vibes. Plus (spoiler S2E5) >!it's the one that plays when V goes to see in Niko in Oxford and that moment is so over the top!<.

**Favorite outfit**  
 [https://imgur.com/PKINhYR](https://imgur.com/PKINhYR)  
The outfit V wears at her place when Konstantin shows up to tell her she has to go to London, which she again wears at the very end of the episode. It's the one that feels the most like her in this episode.

**Favorite kill**  
The Tuscany kill. It reveals so much about V: how chill she is while on a kill, how she is okay using a child to lure her target in, how much panache she puts into her kills, and how thrilling she finds it.

**Favorite line**  
Again, some pretty good contenders, but I'd say Eve calling Elena and saying, ""I was counting on you not having a life."" That burn. Also, Eve, who are you to judge when you are also working?

**Favorite Villaneve moment**  
I mean... The toilet scene. Uh.

**Weekly topic: hair**  
There's so much to say. I think PWB said it best when describing KE in three words, ""Murder, murder, hair."" It reflects so much people's personalities, their state of mind...  
As a quick note, I love how V asked Konstantin if he had a haircut and that completely throws him off."
1703,2020-06-15 17:51:58,h9h83q,"I am so excited that we are doing this. I NEED this between my dental hygiene studies. Ok, so here are my favorites:

**Favorite Song**

Killer Shangri-Lah by Pshycotic Beats – “I had to kill you. I’m really sorry.” It just sets the show’s tone for me. 2nd runner up is the classical song playing when K walks into V’s apartment – Gnossienne No. 3. I love classical music, and I now love this song.

**Favorite Kill**

Caesar Greco in Tuscany. That hairpin is by far my favorite murder weapon in the series. V is so cold here, writing down the name of the throw designer while watching Caesar die...Amazing.

**Favorite Line**

“You really should ask before you touch a person.” I LOVE THIS LINE. I think the 12 ordered his death because he is a sex trafficker too (was this in the books? I can't remember), which makes the line even better.

**Favorite Outfit**

I really like V’s first outfit from the Vienna kill. I love the material and the way it naturally flows on her. Add the pink coat to it, and she looks very classy. It was an excellent choice to introduce the character.

**Favorite V Moment**

This may seem silly to some readers, but I die laughing every time V mocks that poor old lady carrying the trash down the stairs. She is so mean to her, and it is also hilarious.

**Favorite E Moment**

Eve realizing someone noticing her brilliance and seeing her smile throughout the entire episode. I miss smiling Eve.

**Weekly Topic: Hair**

Love the wig V wears in the opening scene. Also, let’s not forget the ‘Wear it down” moment. Ugh!"
1704,2020-06-15 20:07:18,h9h83q,"Hooray! I was so looking forward to this thread :) Thanks again for setting it up! I haven't watched season one in a long time, and it was such a fun experience, particularly thinking about how far the characters have come since then. I found that there were some lines that I laughed at or had a kind of snide chuckle at because they seem even more ironic now that they did even at the end of season one. I'm thinking specifically of when Eve tells Bill, ""Trouble's not interested in me."" Oof.

I'll follow suit and go through the rest of my notes :)

**Favorite song**

Like others have also said, I think my favorite song from this ep is *When a Woman Is Around* by Unloved. I just remember the first time I was watching this episode and how struck I was by the tone that the music set for the show. When this song in particular came on, I remember thinking to myself ""This soundtrack just *so fucking cool.""*

**Favorite outfit**

I think I'll go with V's outfit when she first returns to her Paris apartment after the Vienna kill. I guess I'm going to get caught reminiscing about my first time watching it, but I was reminded so much of my initial thoughts this time around so I'm gonna stick them in anyway. I sort of include all of her shopping bags as part of this outfit, because it just said so much to me about this already intriguing character. Like, she's just returned home after killing someone and has already set out on a celebratory shopping jaunt. I also just remember thinking ""Oh, she's that *rich* rich kind of assassin,"" because I was so used to seeing assassins in tv shows or movies living kind of rough.

**Favorite kill**

Tuscany, for sure. Aside from the amazing hairpin moment (and V's look of euphoria which really struck me in stark contrast to the turmoil of some of her S3 kills), I really enjoyed the smaller moments that showed the kind of *labor* involved in what Villanelle does and just how good she is at it. These are kind of small details, but I'm specifically referring to 1.) when she kind of has this moment of exertion when she pulls herself up onto the top of roof of the house and 2.) the little huff that she lets out after climbing out of the suitcase (amazing improvisation). It was just really cool to be reminded of how hard and also dangerous it would be to do a job like that, but V is just so damn good at it!! Her badassery is unparalleled.

**Favorite line**

I let out an ugly cackle at Elena saying, ""My sister and *her arsehole baby* are staying with me while she goes for interviews."" It's just one of those moments where the show really pointedly shows where its humor is willing to go (and I'm so grateful for it). I will also never be over when Eve asks Elena about a known assassin's breast size and Elena says ""She appears to have massive, pendulous breasts. Is that doing it for you?"" Her delivery was perfect, and she drags Eve with such finesse. Can you tell I miss their dynamic?

**Favorite Villaneve moment / Hair theme**

Toilet scene for both, for obvious reasons.

Looking forward to discussing future episodes!"
1705,2020-06-15 16:50:42,h9h83q,yay! this is still happening. I'll be back to post later
1706,2020-06-15 19:04:31,h9h83q,"Yes, this is still happening!

**Favorite song:**   
It was pretty hard to choose between *When a Woman Is Around* and *Killer Shangri-lah*, but I will go with the latter. It goes perfectly with Jodie's acting and how much Villanelle loves what she does. As u/TheTinyChair has said, it sets the tone. 

**Favorite outfit:**  
https://imgur.com/PKINhYR - Agree with u/NotAVeryNiceLady, this feels most like Villanelle. I also love the bedspread (I know it's not an outfit, but it shows V's appreciation for the luxurious things in life). Her outfit when she arrives in Paris, with the pink coat, is great also. But doesn't it feel a little too normal for the V will come to know?

**Favorite kill:**  
The Tuscany kill. The whole scene is perfect in showing the audience how talented and dangerous Villanelle is: she is stealthy, she speaks many languages, she is charming, she uses whoever she needs to in order to get the job done and she really likes her job. I love it when she tells the kid to be quiet or she would kill him too... such a meaningless threat that many people use, and yet she totally means it. 

**Favorite line:**  
Carolyn: ""You might want to make him think you are having an affair then"". - It's just funny how Eve took that idea and ran with it... But seriously, it's interesting to see how Eve perceives Niko's trust and their relationship. 

I also have to add Bill: ""I'm sorry if your husband is boring you too, but this doesn't give you an excuse to go rogue at work"". - I feel they really wanted to nail in the head how boring their relationship is. Bill was savage. I miss you, Bill. 

**Favorite Villaneve moment:**  
Only one moment, so it has to be the bathroom. I find it interesting that even without knowing each other their encounter is still so charged, especially V's reaction to it. Eve is just doing her thing, but Villanelle's face is really something in this scene.

**Hair:**  
I love how Villanelle seems like a different person when her hair is down (at home or doing mundane stuff) versus hair up (working/murdering someone).

Also, Sandra's hair is truly amazing. 

**General notes:**  
1. It's interesting to observe that there isn't a single scene without Villanelle or Eve. They really set it up as a show about these two characters and how everything and everyone revolves around them. There's no room for sideline characters, something that will definitely change in S3. 

2. I loved when Bill said in the beginning to Eve ""professional"" and it reminded me of Villanelle saying the same thing to her in season 2. This whole episode is very focused on showing how unprofessional Eve actually is. We have Bill saying this to her, she goes to interrogate the witness without authorization, she records the thing and brings to Niko, she takes a minor to the hospital... What a mess! But it shows us how impulsive Eve actually is, how she will do what it takes to go after what she wants (this case, to confirm her theory). 

3. I miss Bill and I miss Elena. Bill was someone who really knew Eve and wasn't afraid of saying the truth to Eve. And Elena just had some really funny rapport with Eve."
1707,2020-06-15 23:26:57,h9h83q,"**Favorite Song**

Killer Shangri-Lah by Pshycotic Beats – “I had to kill you. I’m really sorry.” After seeing V's first kill in action, her eyes, and hearing this song. It still gives me goosebumps.

**Favorite outfit**

[https://imgur.com/Ak1CFss](https://imgur.com/Ak1CFss) the pink coat and striped trousers on V. Love it when she's at the bottom of the stairs, taunting Madame Tattevin. I also like that the first time we hear her speak it's in french. I love that she can speak so many different languages. But, yes, this outfit in combination with her taking it off once she gets into her apartment lol. Ladies, we all know the feeling of taking off our ""bulletproof"" bras at the end of the day.

**Favorite kill**

Much like Eve, I was at first really impressed with the femoral artery kill. But after seeing the Tuscany kill in action, from start to finish, it was my favorite. V says the title of the episode ""nice face"" when looking up her target. I can watch Jodie Comer eat anything all day, she had a nice carb up ""pre-workout"" I love her reaction to his wife's clothing. And I mean... come on to fit in that suitcase at 5'8, so cool and smart. Again, with the languages, I know this one was her favorite to do, because it was the easiest to learn. I also love her honesty. She's honest with the boy, and even with her mark all the way up to the end.

**Favorite line**

""Wear it down"" With the weekly topic also being Hair, it all works out. Wear it down is an iconic line in this series to me.

**Favorite Villaneve moment**

OBVIOUSLY the bathroom. I have a thing about bathrooms...! I read that PWB wanted V to look at Eve as if it was love at first sight. I think Jodie nailed it. Question for you guys - Do you think V was going to make it look like a suicide before seeing Eve? Do you think seeing her, kind of set her off with excitement? Or just an out of control feeling and killing everyone?

**Weekly Topic: Hair**

Eve's Hair is so curly and messy. I think I love it as much as V does. When Konstantin disturbs V's threesome and starts telling her the good and bad, it's so funny, that V just says - Did you have a haircut? And he shyly says, yes, while touching it. That is so PWB. Of course I love V's hair, down, or in a messy bun. Any which way, she ""kills"" it.

**Other Notes:**

Ice cream in Vienna - Season 3.5 Spoiler

    >!V tells B'orka that Vienna has the best icecream!<  

Did my spoiler tag work?

I miss Elena so much! 

I love the prank V plays on K - ""I got you!"" ""we're you scared?"" ""did you think I was dead?"" ""Would you be sad?"" You can tell the comfort level, and that they have been working together for a long time.

When Bill says to Eve that she was bored with her husband, she didn't deny it. 

Nurse Watkins, she's the one with the fun scrubs.

Frank is a dick-swab! He didn't deserve to be invited to Karaoke.

This was fun! Can I tell you, it was hard to stop right after episode 1. Cold Turkey...!"
1708,2020-06-15 17:58:29,h9h83q,Yay! Glad this is happening! I will post my thoughts later
1709,2020-06-15 19:11:32,h9h83q,"  u/merrem05 thanks so much for putting this together for us. 

In response to your episode 1 observations and fav’s:

· Yes, the opening scene is sooo good. I remember my girlfriend asking me to come watch this show with her, and I rolled my eyes thinking it was another one of her boring murder shows. I was so wrong. That ice-cream hit that kids shirt, and I was hooked. 

· I really miss earlier, happier Eve too. Hoping she comes back to us next season. Sandra Oh really deserves a good wardrobe and some ‘killer’ scenes. 

· Your favorite line is a good and important one for sure.

· I totally forgot to add a VillanEve moment! How could I do this? The bathroom scene is everything. I love the way V’s eyes widen as she sees Eve. It is like her whole body is consumed. 

Looking forward to our next rewatch."
1710,2020-06-15 22:06:36,h9h83q,"No one mentioned this before, but my fav outfit is the top she wears after konstantin woke her and her threesome friends up. Its something i could wear without looking stupid :D"
1711,2020-06-15 18:11:10,h9h83q,"Ah I’m soo glad you’ve posted! I’ve been sitting here all day thinking where is the rewatch post, where is the rewatch post, WHERE IS THE REWATCH POST. 

I will be back when I’ve watched properly but this is just from my sad obsessive memory. I also loved Frank...one of my favourite lines is from him in the next episode. 

Favourite moment: Eve saying “cool” after Carolyn described how Kedrin was murdered and the looks on Carolyn and Frank’s faces. 

Favourite song: Devil’s Angel at the end when V is laying the Liliana Rizzari throw on her bed and looking at her Bulgaria postcard. I remember thinking at the end of the episode this is like nothing I’ve ever watched before and how I really wanted to see more."
1712,2020-06-16 08:13:03,h9h83q,"Thank you so much for organising this! It's exactly what we all need to get through the next tortuously long 12+ months! I'm happy to help out, btw, if I can. I hope nobody minds if I go slightly rogue and don't comment on a fave of each category...?

S1E1 is obviously where we all fell in love with KE. I for one, did not recognise the name 'Jodie Comer' at this point, despite having watched 'The White Princess' TWICE!! I remember watching that first scene of hers in Vienna, tipping the girl's ice cream onto her and thinking (no, actually saying out loud), what a bitch she was. Little was I to know what was in store. I'm not sure why I thought she was such a bitch in this scene but hilariously funny in the scene with Madame Tattavin when she was talking to her like she was dog. Just so GOOD and so PWB!

The music, the title cards, the visual beauty of it was just such a mood and so, so different to anything else on TV. I've always loved British television and movies and I adore the British sense of humour and I think KE was just (and still is) such a breath of fresh air.

Devil's Angel is up there with my favourite songs of the entire series - it's just so Villanelle (and probably Eve now, but not back then  when she was still trying to be a good girl moonlighting as '...just a fan...'). I know I said I wasn't doing favourites, but hard not to mention the  Tuscany kill as it is the ultimate kill, imo, and remains at the top of my list. As Bill said '...the hairpin was pretty cool!' Plus, who doesn't want to see cheeky V uncurling out of a suitcase!"

1714,2020-07-04 19:16:04,h9h83q,"Right, so finally got round to watching it after 3 weeks since you posted this thread, oops!

So my overall thought is that this is one of the best pilot episodes of a TV show I've ever seen. Most first episodes are a little bit slow and boring, just a general introduction to the characters. It normally takes me a good few episodes to get into new programmes but this had everything from the word go - throwing ice cream, hairpin stabbings, slitting throats, being fired, being recruited as a secret agent almost immediately afterwards.....so much going on but all relevant. I think it was a very good move on Phoebe's part to have V and Eve meet in the first episode, albeit briefly....as I said, these shows normally take ages to get going but this set Killing Eve up perfectly. 

It's classic PWB humour, you can see her writing all over this. With the cutaway after Eve saying ""at least we have the whole weekend to recover"", the shot of tampons next to bullets in V's drawer (wow, that's a lot of tampons! She really does have heavy periods), the relationships with Bill and Elena...all very Phoebe. 

I thought the first scene of V was clever....not doing a kill but just chucking ice cream over an annoying kid. Something we've all secretly wanted to do, I remember Phoebe saying in an interview how do you make people like/care about a psychopath. I think making her a little bit relatable like that right from the start was an excellent choice. 

Fav Outfit: I did like the Vienna outfit. Not normally a fan of open toed boots but they look good on her. To be honest, I even liked the blue Tuscany dress but then Jodie/V can pull anything off.

Fav Kill: Obviously the hairpin. Not just because it's a cool way to kill someone but V really has to think on her feet quickly in terms of getting in the house and how to do it - it shows how clever and resourceful she is and exactly why Eve is fascinated with her. Re V in the suitcase, I know it was a scene in one of the books...I thought it was in the second book but I think that came out after S1 or around the same time. Wondered whether Luke came up with and Phoebe adapted it. I'm also glad they cut that scene with the good looking Italian guy out in the car. I like that they just focused on her doing the job then leaving and not being distracted by anything else. I feel like it wouldn't be true to V's character (TV show V anyway) to be distracted by anyone other than Eve. 

Theme of the week/Hair: Again, more Phoebe influence here. Hair is everything as she rightly says. I'm curious how the hair obsession came up....had they already cast Sandra, Phoebe noticed her amazing hair and decided to make it V's obsession? Was there always going to be a hair theme? I'm curious to know! 

Fav Line: Not sure it's a fav. line exactly but I like the scene where Eve tells Niko how she'd kill him. She's so cheery when she says it. Niko was actually quite likeable in this episode I thought, being supportive and helping her do the translating. I didn't think of it at the time when I first watched it - Eve's tenacity in interviewing Kasia/constantly questioning about the CCTV made her seem intelligent and quirky. But now after S3 it's blatantly obvious Eve was a raging nutcase haha! In that I think there's a lot of darkness there that is fueling her which the audience isn't yet aware of. 

Fav Villaneve moment: I really like the imagery of them in the toilets staring at each other in front of the mirrors, like they're a mirror image of each other. I've said this before, but they both have little agency over their own lives. The whole exchanges with V/Konstantin are cute but actually he just walks into her apartment whenever he feels like it, gets told you've got to go here tomorrow, somewhere else in an hour. Eve is trapped in a boring desk job with a boring husband. 

Finally, I loved the introduction of Frank and Carolyn. Especially when Eve has just been fired, it's quiet for a second then Carolyn says ""so what were you right about"". Hilarious. 

Woah that was loooong. I never get bored of watching these episodes, I notice new things all the time.

1716,2020-06-15 18:08:18,h9h83q,Yes! Finally someone wrote about the moment with the old lady and trash 😂 When I first watched it I didn't know if I'm allowed to laugh so hard lol
1717,2020-06-15 18:03:59,h9h83q,"Good luck with studying!

Just one thing I wonder: how accurate do we think the lyrics of Killer Shangri-Lah are? ""I have to kill you"", sure. But then I heard, ""I'm really sorry"" and I thought, ""but are you, tho?""

Or is this foreshadowing? V will end up being sorry that she *killed so many people*."
1718,2020-06-15 20:27:15,h9h83q,"yes!! Eve and Elena's dynamic is so good! I miss Elena a lot. That line is so funny, the other one that I liked is ""of course madam, all our calls are confidential"" or something similar"
1719,2020-06-16 08:21:34,h9h83q,"Loved, loved, loved that V wrote the name of the designer on her hand! What a brutal move...who didn't laugh out loud when she did that?"
1720,2020-06-15 20:48:35,h9h83q,I miss Bill too. He had an amazing impact for someone who was only in 3 episodes.
1721,2020-06-15 19:21:54,h9h83q,Do we share the same brain? This is really similar to what I thought of this episode. Love it!
1722,2020-06-15 19:40:22,h9h83q,"Excellent reflections. Yes to all of your general notes, and I really miss Bill and Elena too. 

I think another reason why I like the opening outfit is that it is part of one of her kill personas too. I didn't like the blue dress in the Tuscany kill as much. I definitely agree that the ending outfit does seem more like V. For me, personally, I would wear the outfit in the opening scene, so I am being selfish here."
1723,2020-06-16 00:28:04,h9h83q,"hahaha I started ep 2 right after but then stopped myself. I want to give time and focus to each episode. Not sure if I'll be able to stop on the next ep's though. This season just keeps getting better and better. 

I think V was going to do a ""suicide"" kill but she was too excited after seeing Eve. I mean, she had just met the love of her life...<3"
1724,2020-06-16 06:21:57,h9h83q,">Question for you guys - Do you think V was going to make it look like a suicide before seeing Eve? Do you think seeing her, kind of set her off with excitement? Or just an out of control feeling and killing everyone?

Actually, I don't think she ever planned on making it look like a suicide. At that point, she has no idea who Eve is. So yeah, it probably excited her and she might have gone even more overboard, but it's also not completely out of character. As Carolyn says, ""She is starting to show off."" And from her conversation with Konstantin, I get the feeling she really thinks she is above any rules because she does her job so well that The Twelve will not get rid of her."
1725,2020-06-16 08:26:38,h9h83q,Full disclosure: I did not stop. Don't start a project like this when you are drinking multiple cocktails with other KE addicts.
1726,2020-06-15 19:23:53,h9h83q,"I am up for a shopping scene with V and Eve, V judging Eve on her clothing choices and ending up picking her clothes, then Eve wearing the clothes they buy for the whole season 4."

1735,2020-06-15 18:47:16,h9h83q,"Hmm, I'm not sure, honestly. I don't view it as foreshadowing, but I can certainly see how it is possible. I would be very surprised to learn that the intention of growing this guilt and regret within V was actualized by the writers this early on, but you never know!"

1751,2020-06-15 16:46:06,h9gl1a,"What a coincidence, I just watched this ereyesterday for the first time in years. That moment when Sandra Bullock thinks she ran over a baby in that carriage, right at the start of the second act, that right there is everything. The way it's written and shot, and most importantly how she plays it literally made my eyes tear up instantly. After that, your totally invested in whatever's gonna come, you know? 

There's a bunch of brilliant moments like that, the woman very nearly getting her legs chopped off by the elevator, the small first bomb in the front of the bus. Rightfully considered a classic."
1752,2020-06-15 21:32:06,h9gl1a,Watch Point Break if you enjoy 90s Keanu in action roles.

1758,2020-06-16 00:45:13,h9gl1a,I just watched this for the first time today with a friend and I gotta say. What a masterpiece. The baby carriage scene is the scariest. What a wild ride the entire time. I will def be watching this again very soon.
1759,2020-06-16 01:35:49,h9gl1a,"I watched this as a child (lenient parents lol) and thought it was cool of course, but watching it as an adult was incredible! Seriously great writing."
1760,2020-06-16 02:55:38,h9gl1a,LOVE this film. I've probably seen it about twenty times. My favourite part is when Keanu and Sandra Bullock have to escape the bus through the door on the floor. I love the way the whole thing is shot and it's so cathartic when they slide out onto the tarmac! Ugh. And of course Dennis Hopper is just amazing in it.
1761,2020-06-16 04:27:41,h9gl1a,"I took my dad to watch it in the theater, he is a big action movie guy. We watched it back to back with Arnold's True Lies. He liked Speed much more."
1762,2020-06-16 00:59:34,h9gl1a,I believe in the original script the bomber dies in the first act but Jeff Daniels character is still shot.  He was secretly enraged at being shot and Keanu’s character getting the glory and plot twist executed the whole bus bomb scheme while also “helping” Keanu’s character.
1763,2020-06-16 01:30:48,h9gl1a,"Indeed, [""La Vitesse""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1sQkEfAdfY#t=5m48s) is a classic."
1764,2020-06-16 10:27:01,h9gl1a,and I was just talking about Keanu Reeves the other day!

I venture to Reddit to find fans discussing this since I have thoughts. Cool! I find one and joined. After a few months, someone posted about it.

1777,2020-06-16 00:53:51,h9gl1a,"Exactly, and up until now I had no idea. I assumed it was just a generic action movie from the 90s. How wrong I was. I'm glad you enjoyed it!"

1780,2020-06-16 03:58:40,h9gl1a,Neat! I'm glad they ended up with the one they did because the back and forth between Keanu and Dennis Hopper was great. And Jeff Daniels dying was such a gut-wrenching moment. When he saw the bomb and realized he lost...chills.

This. It's exactly what they've done with having female head writers every season and a majority of women in the production team. And everyone here would agree that it's been beneficial to the show. So why is it so hard to do the same with BIPOC ?"

1803,2020-06-14 21:22:30,h8wyca,"Killing Eve has included people of color in the cast. The star, Sandra Oh, is a person of color. She is also an executive producer and contributes to ideas about her character, a Korean/White American. 

Having Sandra there IS including a person of colors voice into the mix when mapping out the stories each season. She gets a say over story, she has said so in interviews.

Now if we are talking exclusively about having a Black bisexual writer in the Killing Eve writers room, why would be be talking about that? The Black bisexual perspective is not relevant to the story but the Asian bisexual perspective is because the main character is Asian/White. 

Seeing that Sandra Oh has influence over story, and she is a person of color, is there further need for an Asian writer in the writers room? Do they need an Korean bisexual woman in the writers room?

I am querying in earnest."
1804,2020-06-14 22:32:24,h8wyca,"Thanks for doing this research and breaking it down for us like this. I see a lot of people taking this criticism negatively and also going as far as to say that one of the leads is a person of colour so what are people complaining about. Firstly, from what I've seen on this forum it's been mostly constructive criticism and no one is being particularly negative which is great. Secondly, there is no quota on the number of persons of colour that can work on a project. It really couldn't hurt the show to have more diversity, at all. The fact that people think like this is a part of the problem.

Openly having this conversation about diversity in the film industry is so important. I am sure there are a lot talented writers of colour that would jump at the opportunity to work on KE. I recently watched The Half of It, a queer, Asian, coming of age story, written by an Asian woman. Do you think a movie like that could exist if not for people having these exact conversations and putting pressure on film execs to allow these stories to be told???

We love KE and we are not trying to tear it down, we're just saying there is room for improvement, whether or not they choose to act based on the critique given, is up to the execs."

1806,2020-06-14 18:10:35,h8wyca,"This is super important - while it's easy to identify when what's on-screen has a lack of diversity, too often what's behind screen has a even less .

I always think the argument of 'talent'(hire based on talent, or not enough non-white talent, etc) is total BS, because it plays directly into the systematic lack of opportunities, discrimination, or bias at virtually every stage for non-white people prior to roles in the writers room, directors, etc - and it is important to tackle that at every level of opportunity to broaden the talent pool.

And it's *really* important because the world *is* actually diverse - far far far more so than what's often depicted on main stream media. Get more diversity behind the scenes, and you'll likely have more in front of it as well. Showing more of the actual world.

And you have to take another step back - media companies are still predominately run by white men, and that perpetuates a cycle as well. I think 1 person of the 12-13 BBC Boardmembers is non-white. And only 3 are women."
1807,2020-06-15 00:30:09,h8wyca,"Yes! I don’t accuse KE of being racist, but as an Asian-Am, I would appreciate it more if at least one of the writers was Asian. I mean, honestly I feel spoiled from having an Asian lead, but it would be great to have an Asian writer as well!"

This season there was Spain, Russia, Poland and Romania as far as I can remember. All but UK aren't exactly immigration destinations. I've lived in two of these countries and there are simply rarely any people of color."

1810,2020-06-15 04:18:05,h8wyca,"Constructive critical analysis of this kind is important because it lays bare how lacking the representation of BIPOC in front of the camera is and it's non-existence behind the scenes, so many thanks for this post. For white eyes it's easy to argue the cast is diverse, but this type of information makes it objectively clear that diversity is shallow when the screen presence is so limited. I sincerely hope those behind KE are taking note and already looking to how they can increase meaningful and on-going representation on screen and off for BIPOC. 

It's thrilling to watch such an intelligent show filled with incredible women written *by women.* To have greater diversity in the writing that allows for a true reflection of the lived experiences of BIPOC will only make it all the richer. The writing for S4 may be effectively done, but we know the scripts are often reworked right up to the point of shooting a scene so there's plenty of time to at least start moving in that direction before next season, and hopefully a whole lot more."
1811,2020-06-14 21:49:10,h8wyca,"There’s definitely an unconscious bias. Not just in KE, but the industry in general.

This sentiment is everything wrong with the 'diversity for diversity's sake' mentality. It's racist if a BIPOC person is excluded from the room based on them being BIPOC. It is not racist to decide a white person would be better at the job than a BIPOC person.

The notion that a white woman can't write as well for Eve as an Asian woman is as ludicrous as the notion that a Korean writer couldn't write for Villanelle. A good writer isn't limited to their specific perspective of the world. Let's not forget the characters were created by a white guy, after all.

The fact that these writers were shamed and abused for celebrating their achievement makes me incredibly sad."

Diverse writer’s rooms will just generally produce better and/or more interesting content than a homogenous one. Including BIPOC, especially women, provides a wider range of story ideas and perspectives that can be added to the narrative.

I would say this is the only place OP slightly misses the mark. BIPOC, women, and other “minorities” are not (usually) hired to just provide a specific experience to a narrative. A BIPOC can write a scene for V and Konstantin without being a white Russian. It’s their very existence in a writers room, their combined experiences, their voices, their talent, which expand the narrative and develop it beyond what ten people from roughly the same background can do alone."
1824,2020-06-14 22:49:21,h8wyca,"I believe the arts is more about connections / nepotism than any inherent , deliberate racial bias. Jodie herself has bucked the trend by becoming successful from a relatively modest background.

Coming from a poor background in the UK limits you much more than ethnicity in this field - you don't form the social connections needed. Look at how many actors etc are related to others, or went to the same school. 

For example Waller Bridge comes from a minor nobility background, private school etc.  Sure she has talent but it has been much easier for her to get somewhere because of her back ground.

Of course this creates a self perpetuating cycle - but you see it in the judiciary as well, for example."
1825,2020-06-14 19:17:39,h8wyca,"I think this is missing the point imo. 

You can find a lot of this kind of thought in video games (for example) that feature women as playable characters, some people don’t want women in it cause “it would break the immersion” or “there weren’t any women in that war/history/nation etc.. 

These are fictional products made for entertainment. Do we really care if it’s not 100% accurate? It is a show catered to an international audience, so it can have as many poc on screen as they want (and should!). Even if some people are the minority they do exist. 

One other example: You don’t see that many women in positions of power irl, yet the show made the decision to have that in it. In an interview Suzanne had on the BBC one podcast, she was saying how in the world of KE, women are in power and that’s normal, there is no need to acknowledge that or make a big deal about it.

1827,2020-06-14 23:34:32,h8wyca,"I think we are all against the random people on Twitter harassing writers. But I don’t believe what we are saying is “diversity for diversity sake”. 

To me the point is:

1) we all agree KE has done a great job on screen casting a diverse cast and we are all grateful for the inclusion of so many great women that bring their unique view to the show.

2) we are noticing that in this time of social unrest many people feel left out and are very vocal about the issues in the entertainment industry.

3) we don’t condone harassment nor criticize the writers directly, but we do agree that specifically because of the new rising of these issues currently, people should be allowed to express their frustration if they don’t see themselves represented (specifically behind the camera in this case).

4) I think from a viewer perspective there is nothing wrong with the portrait KE has done, but as someone working in the industry, the lack of diversity behind the camera could be triggering of some criticism. 

In the end the product might not have changed (like you said, a writer can write of many things doesn’t have to have experienced directly). What we support is to keep the fight going so more people can have the opportunity to access those jobs (and hopefully make better more interesting content for everyone). To do that it’s important to keep the conversation going."
1828,2020-06-14 22:23:50,h8wyca,"I hate to say this but there is the reality that Asians are overlooked in general. They are invisible to a degree. There was an article 4 or 5 years ago in (not sure if this is correct) The New Yorker I think. It was chronicling the Asian perspective and included men and women across the spectrum of Asian communities. They all mentioned feeling invisible to the majority white population as well as the other POC's.

I think this may be an example of that. Even though Sandra is an Asian women and the star of the show she is invisible.

EDIT: And that is why I get frustrated and pissed off with the voices for Jodie being so loud. I love Jodie. Yes she's gorgeous and alluring and sexy and totally mind blowing. . . but so is Sandra. It's just that it takes a little effort to not do what we are programmed to do which is focus on the obvious. And most people would rather focus on the obvious."

It really wasn't my intention to suggest getting that specific but since Sandra is Asian I think the person of color in the room should Asian because there is no one universal POC experience, save for marginalization. But seeing as Sandra gives input to the writers room it's not imperative."
1831,2020-06-14 20:56:11,h8wyca,"I would *really* like to see more Black British people in Killing Eve, just to be clear on that before I say anything else. 

But I think it’s perfectly reasonable and valid to want to bring a localised (ie European) and nuanced understanding of racism - and of demographics, including how they intersect with racial hatred (and with xenophobia) - to the show, rather than looking at every cultural property through a filter that’s inherently US-centric. The US-centric model is inspiring because of the profound leadership BIPOC have shown and continue to show in activism, in the face of such outrageous hatred and under-representation, so I’m not claiming it’s irrelevant to cultural properties sited elsewhere. But it also shouldn’t be uniformly imposed as a one-way route to ‘bring diverse enough’. The representation should be convincingly European representation, just as the prejudice in the show has often been all too convincingly European in its nature. 

I hope this isn’t coming across as me holding the very naive view that Europe isn’t racist / is less racist, because I don’t think that for a moment. Only that the manifestation and history of its racism(s) is somewhat different (while still being somewhat the same) as in the US, and so it’s reasonable to want a nuanced application of US models to European properties (while still holding them to account, and seeking to develop equally rigorous European models)."

1834,2020-06-15 02:35:22,h8wyca,"I agree with most of this, thank you for articulating it so well and so thoughtfully. 

I feel like this conversation is extremely relevant and necessary - and if KE does believe that they have been ignorant, I am sure they will course correct. For instance, they recognised the fact that to write the shift in V/Eve's dynamic in an authentic way, they needed a LGBTQ writer in the room - that doesn't mean again, that straight people cannot write this dynamic - they've been doing that for three seasons - but they are cognizant of the perspective that Kayleigh would bring and wanted to include it, despite having an idealised reality within the show's world where sexuality is besides the point. 
It's impossible to know whether they would have done this without the queerbaiting allegations - but whichever way we see it, it reflects on them well - they can hear and change, or, they always try to do what's right by the story they're trying to tell. 

I agree with ScandalOz that they've given Sandra direct influence on her story - SH spoke about how much Sandra and she discussed how Eve would process the loss she had gone through, what the concept of home would be etc. In fact working in a Korean kitchen making mandus was Sandra's idea. 

In this context - what the Variety article does, and a lot of the fans are also doing (not you), is they are creating a false equivalence between their frustrations with Eve's arc and representation in the writers room. Which is just a completely false equivalence IMO. To reduce people who are good at their craft to just have the ability to write authentically of their own limited experiences connected to their racial and social identity is diminishing the craft of writing entirely. And this is a pushback KE doesn't deserve to get at this stage. 

That being said - should they make their crew (and not just the writers room) more diverse? 100%! As a show that is a frontrunner in breaking barriers, there is no reason that they shouldn't keep pushing themselves to do better. And completely agree that POCs bring perspective and focal areas that would be interesting in and of themselves to explore. I refuse to call this an ""anti racist"" stance because it implies that if you don't actively include representation in every sphere, you're racist, which is just...

In any case, hoping to see KE the best of this criticism and not the worst, and work with it in the way that keeps their journey and approach authentic, but continues to strive for marginalised voices in the industry as they've always done. They've made MASSIVE strides in that area already, so I don't see why they would stop."
1835,2020-06-15 04:38:41,h8wyca,"....what? I never said she is satisfied with the lack of diversity in the show. What I stated was that she does count as diversity, so it must be sad to have her presence overlooked, especially when she is a lead & high up in the production team.

I understand if you are frustrated with the US (it can be a pretty shitty place at times), but that shouldn't twist the focus of this discussion which is diversity and inclusion in the entertainment industry (and beyond). 

Don't you see? No one is beating down on the show. You could also say it is ""perverse"" to be ok with the status quo, hiding behind the excuse of defending the show at all cost with the pretense that these issues don't happen here in the UK/EU, it is only a problem of another country.

And now they are trying to pit Jodie and Sandra against each other, saying why Jodie has been getting all the praise and Sandra was, again pushed to the sidelines. I beg to disagree with this. Jodie has been getting praises not because of her skin color, but because she’s the breakout star of the show because she’s been doing an absolute great job as Villanelle. She is super talented and can adapt on many roles. And it’s not like Sandra isn’t getting any attention either. She has a movie and a new series with Netflix coming up, and people are also starting to recognize her for Killing Eve and not (just) Grey’s now, so I don’t get why some people feel the need to pit them against each other to raise a point, like it was Jodie’s fault for getting a lot of attention from casting directors these days because of a job well done.

> For instance, they recognised the fact that to write the shift in V/Eve's dynamic in an authentic way, they needed a LGBTQ writer in the room - that doesn't mean again, that straight people cannot write this dynamic - they've been doing that for three seasons - but they are cognizant of the perspective that Kayleigh would bring and wanted to include it, despite having an idealised reality within the show's world where sexuality is besides the point.

I liked that they did this, so that they could write a more accurate “lesbian love story” between Eve and Villanelle (if they are going that way for season 4). And also just the fact that it was Sandra’s idea to have Eve go back to her roots and work at a Korean restaurant making mandu and them actually acknowledging it and adding into the show is a big sign that they are not closed off to just their own ideas. They recognize and incorporate them if they are good enough. That’s something we should not ignore.

I guess the thing with this whole debacle is that it has been twisted so much that some people are making it seem worst than it is (and by ‘it’ I mean Sandra; I don’t know if she’d like this if she hears about what fans are saying)."
1838,2020-06-15 10:37:11,h8wyca,"I think we are in agreement. To me personally it was never about Sandra nor the connection with her lack of screen time/story arc.

What prompted my action was seeing comments that were dismissive of the diversity/inclusion issues at large that the industry (and our society) is experiencing. I don’t think it is fair to be dismissive and avoid dialogue even if it makes us uncomfortable.

In terms of the press, I can see how the issue is sadly skewed. It doesn’t help anyone if they make the wrong connection, the conversation need to be about jobs and the system not about the art. 

Love you all ❤️"
1839,2020-06-15 06:06:00,h8wyca,"I totally agree with the point on what I also believe to be a false equivalence between Eve's arc and the representation in the team. I do not see a connexion there and for me, the arc just makes sense and fits the character.

That being said, I don't agree with that point:

> I refuse to call this an ""anti racist"" stance because it implies that if you don't actively include representation in every sphere, you're racist, which is just... 

And I'll start by saying I very much am an idealist on this. But I think that there's a big space between being racist and being anti-racist. I do not believe the KE team has been racist, they have not actively done anything negative that was guided by bias against BIPOC. But IMHO, they could have gotten a bit more out of their way to overcome the inherent systemic biases we all have.

Do they deserve as strong a backlash as what they are apparently getting at the moment? No. Should they be called on it so that they can adjust their course and do better? Yes, like everyone, we can all do better."

Zhang and all those asian extras (and there is a lot, every time the camera pans) is the reason why Sandra Oh's casting and influence is important for the show. Maybe it is their own little way of making it more diverse. Ultimately it made the show more interesting especially going forward to season 3 where we get to see Sandra Oh working and recovering in New Malden."
1841,2020-06-15 05:33:27,h8wyca,"Sorry, it came off more aggressive than I meant it to. Maybe I've misunderstood what you were saying and agreeing to in the post you replied to.

1843,2020-06-15 06:11:04,h8wyca,"Agreed with the above, and accept the disagreement. I agree completely with your framing of the issue - but I don't like the nomenclature around it. Ie, I don't think the words that we should be using are ""anti-racist"" for organisations and industries that actively work to fight systemic injustices. Primarily because of what the negation of those words mean - ie if you're not anti-racist, you're racist. Which again is a false equivalence as per me (and I am a WOC)."

I was saying it must hurt to have *her presence* not counted as representation. I said nothing about her being pleased or displeased with the *amount* of representation on the show, just that it's offensive to say the show has none when the lead & producer of the show does represent a minority population."
1845,2020-06-15 22:58:18,h8wyca,"It is sad but also necessary in a way. People are super upset these days (I think rightfully so) and unfortunately it gets ugly sometimes until things find a little more balance. 

But also, I think we should welcome constructive criticism especially if it comes from professionals in the industry. It is different than all the noise made by people on social media. You will always find extreme reactions and complaints on those platforms (people like to vent and blame strangers) and I agree those can be seen as annoying and frustrating (if they attack something you love) but those are also unrelated in a way to the issues we have been talking about and should not be mixed imo. 

That noise will never go away, today they are complaining about Jodie saying something, tomorrow it will be something else. It is a shame cause in this case it is muddling the overall message.

Because people are saying there's a lack of diversity, you think that means everyone is ignoring that Sandra is a person of colour.

We're not! We love Sandra and are ecstatic that there is an Asian lead character on TV. However, an all-white writer's room has failed to *otherwise* portray substantial characters of colour and has now come up short on writing Eve's character altogether this past season. Hope that clears things up!"
1850,2020-06-15 23:13:55,h8wyca,"No worries. I face exactly the same issues in my industry (engineering),  although that tends to be more of a gender issue. 
It's a tough problem to solve - on the one hand we need more diversity; on the other there is a lack of actual women doing it and the ones who do, want to get places on their own merit - not just due to their gender.

However things are changing in that regard and it's better for it - but it starts at school and takes a long time."
1851,2020-06-15 08:35:43,h8wyca,"Agree that it's a spectrum, but the moment you say anti anything, the immediate implication is that if you don't follow the code prescribed under ""anti-racist"", you're racist. Which is extremely misleading. I am not in a position to suggest alternatives, but off the top of my head, the best way to start is by using words like Pro-D&I.

There were times I definitely didn't like or agree with Owen, but there have been times I haven't liked just about every character lol."
1858,2020-06-12 01:21:30,h7ad22,"I love Owen Hunt. First of all, I find him super hot! But secondly, I like him as a character. I find his flaws and struggles relatable, and although I often disagree with his choices, I always understand where they are coming from. He is a complicated man played skillfully by Kevin McKidd, and I find myself constantly rooting for his happiness (even though he is usually his own worst enemy).

...And did I mention that I find him super hot?"
1859,2020-06-12 00:58:37,h7ad22,"I really enjoyed Owen for the longest time. As a fellow ginger, it was just fun to watch a badass ginger dude yell at people and have softie moments.  But the more I thought about it, the more he reminded me of your typical “dad’s being an asshole tonight” mood."
1860,2020-06-12 01:23:24,h7ad22,This is exactly what I am saying. Like he makes horrible decisions. Which actually makes him more real and relatable. The fact that his is hot might be some of the reason I look past what he does. He is one fine piece of man.
1861,2020-07-09 03:37:09,h7ad22,"I feel like they paint him out to be the bad guy in every relationship. He is a traditionalist and the show totally paints every person who holds traditional values as a bad guy. 
That's what irritates me. If they are not messed like Meridith with her ideals and morals then they are not worth listening to.
Most time I agree with Hunt. Especially when we first got introduced to him, I mean he was amazing, hot and rugged and open. Remember when shepherd and Mark hated him. That was the sexy Owen Hunt we all know and love. They screwed that up"
1862,2020-06-12 03:07:59,h7ad22,Agreed!!
1863,2020-06-12 01:29:46,h7ad22,Yeah I see what your saying. I think he is like this because of his childhood. He lost his dad at a young age. So he lost that father figure in his life. Which is the reason he probably feels like he needs to be the protector in all of his relationships. Growing up he had two sides of his mother. She was someone who was strong raising two kids of her own. But as we saw she never got remarried. Because of this he probably saw how sad and lonely his mom was and just wanted her to find someone. So Owen grew up with a independent women. This is why he excepts and wants a women that is strong and passionate about their work.
1864,2020-06-12 03:16:54,h7ad22,"Owen is at his best as a mentor and teacher. I loved his relationship with Kepner.

In relationships, he is insufferable and I hated that Cristina hung on as long as she did."

1866,2020-06-12 09:29:05,h7ad22,"No lie detected. He's a good person, he just has patterns he's struggling to not repeat. Which is, like, how most humans work."
1867,2020-06-12 01:15:07,h7ad22,I see where your coming from but they were drown to each other from the moment they met. They are both people who have faced real issues in their lives. I feel like when something is wrong in your life you are going to go straight to the person that you feel the most comfortable with.
1868,2020-06-12 10:26:31,h7ad22,I don’t think that’s entirely accurate. I think he kinda just dropped all of their past issues during these moments. He definitely loved her but obviously they weren’t 100% compatible. After the crash she was literally manic. Then she up and left after.
1869,2020-06-12 10:47:17,h7ad22,[removed]
1870,2020-06-12 06:59:24,h7ad22,I don’t know to me personally. Teddy and Owen just feel forced. With him and Cristina I could feel the chemistry. An with Teddy it feels like they never pick one another.
1871,2020-06-12 01:22:55,h7ad22,"I don't know... One thing that rubs me the wrong way was his proposal. It was very clear that before the shooting Cristina dumped Owen, and wanted away from him because he didn't know where he stood between Cristina and Teddy in terms of romantic attraction. She was struggling to hold on, and it was clear that she was suffering from PTSD. She was in an episode when he proposed to her.

I didn't really realize when I watched the first time, and I thought it was romantic, but it seemed that he was taking advantage of her when she was vulnerable. She was struggling to even be a surgeon again, shivering on her couch, of course she wouldn't be able to make a sound choice about whether or not she was going to marry a man because she wanted to be ""normal.""

I think my last point is going to be how hasty the marriage was, and how, because of Cristina's PTSD, the duo were rarely considering their goals in their marriage. Certainly they were attracted to one another, and they have faced great deals in their lives, but their romantic attraction clearly wasn't enough, and worse, they didn't have time to think the marriage through. 

To me, this whole thing makes him seem really short-sighted, and I would understand if it was just one marriage, but then he proceeds to do the same thing Amelia. The man has little conscience to learn from his mistakes."
1872,2020-06-12 15:52:50,h7ad22,"She didn't leave after the shooting if I remember correctly.  I'm pretty sure they got married. No one is in the right mind to get married while suffering from PTSD.

The plane crash I was mistaken, she up and left, I edited my comment."
1873,2020-06-12 14:40:45,h7ad22,"Amen! I also liked when he told Amelia that she could use him in every way imaginable and they started going at it in the Attendings lounge. Drama aside, those two made a very attractive couple!"
1874,2020-06-12 02:15:15,h7ad22,"That proposal scene is so hard to watch. Cristina was clearly so vulnerable and scared, she was not in a place to be proposed to. Owen should've known better, part of me thinks he knew she would say yes and that's why he asked her."
1875,2020-06-12 16:06:38,h7ad22,You’re correct I meant to include her leaving after the crash.
1876,2020-06-12 02:20:33,h7ad22,"YES YES 100 TIMES YES

thats what i feel too, but thats up for interpretation, to each their own."
1877,2020-06-12 02:27:22,h7ad22,"I had to watch the scene again. 

Cristina is mad at Owen for not being home on time and curls up on the couch. She's clearly upset. Own asks her what's wrong and she says ""I don't want to be alone."" Owen replies, ""you don't ever have to be alone again. I'm not going anywhere, Cristina. I won't ever leave again. You hear me? I am not going anywhere. Cristina. If you'll let me stay."" Then he shows her the ring, she puts it on and says ""thank you."" The fact that she thanked him for proposing to her is... oof.... it's hard to watch and speaks to how traumatized she was during that time."

So first of all, you didn’t give Damian any lines to say. You know that you need to give him lines so you can be reacting and responding to him. That’s one of the most important aspects of written work...turning your monologue into a dialogue. And your tactics must always go before the line they apply to, not after. Also...always word your objective in the first person. Start by completely identifying with the character...”I want to frighten Damian so he will give me the information I need to put everyone who is guilty of this crime in prison.”  I wrote this out for you, but make sure you do everything I ask for in the future. I added a final line for you to say at the end to tie up your objective. 

———-

**Who is he talking to? -** Damien the suspect of attempted murder and murder.

**Objective:**  I want the names of who Damien is working for and justice for the murdered and my wife. My goal is to get him to talk.  I need to make him believe that it is more dangerous to refuse to talk to me than to rat on the master mind of the crime. Make him believe I could do him serious harm. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------

*(Tactic: To appear menacing and clever...Let him know I have proof of his guilt by making a sarcastic joke about returning the bullet he put into my wife)*

Detective: You left something at the hospital Damien. I thought you might want it back. The doctors, they pulled it out of my wife. 

Damien:  So they saved her. I didn’t kill her. You should be happy. 

*(Tactic: Point out that he’s wrong—she is not out of danger yet. She could die and give me good reason to take revenge on him)*

Detective:  There's another one still in her but they're afraid to take it out because it might kill her. 

Damien:  (Pointing at the district Asst. DA) Who’s she?

*(Tactic: Portray myself as a loose canon. Frighten him with my uncontrollable behavior. I need to someone to guard against me losing it and killing him on the spot.)*

Detective:  I'd like to introduce you to someone, this is Asst District Attorney Ally Robinson. Do you know why she's here? So I don't choke you out with my glock. 

Damian:  Why would that be necessary?

*(Tactic: Clarify...To prove I have a history of being violent and everyone knows it. )

Detective:  You see they're worried about me around here, they think I'm unstable. 

Damian:  What do you mean unstable?

*(Tactic: Get in his face with my manic craziness. Show him how dangerous I’ve always been.)*

Detective:  They think I have a screw loose and this was before you tried to murder the mother of my children. 

Damian:  Look...I didn’t kill your wife. She’s going to be fine. Relax!

*(Tactic: To reveal that he is a murderer and killed the father of innocent children. Frighten him with his guilt. Rub his nose in the faces of the children he left fatherless.)*

Detective:  No, my kids got lucky. This is Sandra and Elizabeth Mills. You killed their father last night. 

Damian:  Oh my God...I didn’t know!

*(Tactic: Make him see that ignorance and lack of intention won’t get him off the hook. He’s going to pay!)*

Detective:  That's right! Pulling the trigger is easy, but facing the consequences, not so much! 

Damian:  (Crying) Please...I didn’t mean to. You’ve got to believe me!

*(Tactic: Make him see that his feelings of remorse will not help him. He needs to do more)*

Detective:  Oh no, you don't get to cry -  not in front of me!  You’re gonna have to talk!"

1880,2020-06-11 20:53:42,h12hx0,Tocantins was my first season and it’s at Top 3 season for me. Bias I know but either way it’s undeniably amazing and Taj is my favourite one time player
1881,2020-06-11 20:12:41,h12hx0,I honestly really like all of these seasons except for One World.

1884,2020-06-16 02:17:35,h12hx0,"I remember being like 11 watching the premiere of Samoa. When Russell burned people's socks I was just so SHOCKED. I was no Survivor superfan, but I knew in my gut that this guy was new and different and completely evil. As much as I dislike him sometimes, I can't deny his influence on the game. There's at least one winner post-Russell (I don't know how much you know about later seasons so I won't say who) that I don't think would have won without Russell being a part of Survivor. There have been plenty of influential players in Survivor, but I think watching Russell take the game to a whole new manipulative level is on par with Hatch creating alliances, although Hatch's game was more solid overall.

As for HvV, I don't remember what I thought of the gameplay, but I remember going into it it was basically a season filled with players 12 YO me had a crush on (JT, Tom, Colby, James). I hadn't seen PI so I don't know how I felt about Sandra, but I don't remember being disappointed. I went back and watched the premiere and it still gets me hyped up years later. I being hyped up before the season and telling all of my friends (who did not watch Survivor) about Boston Rob coming back and Parvati and just the editing and the music of that premiere brings all that excitement back. But I get how watching it after it being so hyped up can make it good but not fantastic.

I paused my own binging at the Amazon cause I got sidetracked watching L&O: SVU, but I'm back at the Amazon. I've seen most of the season before so I mostly want to get through it to watch PI. I've only ever seen the premiere (which is probably up there with the HvV premiere for me, it's so good) but I know the gist so I'm super excited.

P.S. Every time I think of S21 now I just think of Pilot Pete saying ""Chase Rice? The singer? The guy who just performed?"" Because OF COURSE one of the worst seasons of Survivor would intersect with one of the messiest seasons of the Bachelor."
1885,2020-06-22 01:45:46,h12hx0,"Dang Scarn! I ended up way behind you in my watching. I’m watching the first episode of S21 right now, and my jaw just about fell on the floor when I saw Jimmy Johnson on my tv. Couple that with Chase Rice, the singer, and I’m wondering how a season set up like this can go bad. I’m excited to see it.

Otherwise, it should come to no surprise, I agree with you on almost everything. Tocantins jumped towards the top of my list, Gabon was a hilarious train wreck, Heroes v Villains was bomb (besides Tom Westman not getting far in the game), and Russell Hantz is a fascinating player (although I’m in the “Natalie White deserved it” camp). Hopefully I can start catching up again! I enjoy your recaps as I’m watching, and I like that someone shares a good chunk of my different survivor opinions. :)"

It was so bad I could hardly pay attention.  But even the others that I didn't super enjoy (Gabon and RI) still weren't as bad as I was expecting. People talk so much crap about SoPa (at least on random things that I've read) and I reeeeeally liked it!  And Nicaragua wasn't great but it was still quite entertaining!  I guess I was far less disappointed in this string of seasons than I expected to be, with the exception of One World, lol."

1900,2020-06-10 06:27:05,gzzsoi,"This was such a great post, so glad you've joined the community! :D (PS - as a fellow LOONG form poster/commenter, just one small tip - break up your paras more for easy reading, other than that, perfecto for first post!)

Wanted to reflect (pun alert!)  on some of the things with you, so here goes :)

  
So there's been a lot of commentary on setting this scene on a bridge - it is symbolic of so many things, primarily, the coming together of two opposing sides + water under the bridge. But I loved your perspective on them looking ahead as a symbolic evaluation of their future together. To add to that, I think it also symbolises the ""leap of faith"" - there had been heavy foreshadowing with ""Jumping"" - V in the gondola with Konstantin, and then in the finale itself with Rhian - do you take that leap of faith together, or do you walk back to the mundane life that you previously chose but extricated yourself from?  


>Secondly, when Eve turns around she is only able to see the pedestrians behind her, she is the only one that is able to look at the past with this sort of nostalgia of—‘I used to have these things’. In my opinion I think the only reason that Villanelle couldn’t turn around was because she had already cut all ties to the past.

Actually here - V does look back (she looks over her left shoulder when she sees Eve turn around and talk) and then she does that quip of ""weirdly dressed"" - which by the way, was such a fantastic break in the tension (and also, again, shows us why Eve is so attracted to her - ""she was so funny, and rude!"" - Eve smiling appreciatively with Anna) - so a great call back to this Anna moment + ""you got some really nice clothes out of it"". 

But, I agree in that - Villanelle has always been a forward looking character - she drives herself with forward momentum because that is the only way you can avoid consequences, and you deal with every effect of your past action as an independent new problem. Oksana however is reflective and rooted in her past (""Do you think about the past?""). 

The ballroom had V/Oksana reflecting on her past, and the bridge scene has Eve - but what is interesting is, in both cases, V/Oksana is trying to figure out what the future is for her (and Eve to an extent) - in the ballroom, V/Oksana looks at the sense of belonging in a dancing couple and wants that for her future (what one would perceive as ""normal"") - and Eve gives her that sense of belonging by reflecting on \*their\* future but course corrects it for who they are (""we would never be old enough - we will consume each other""). Then at the bridge, V does the same course correction for Eve by reminding her that reflecting on the past is futile, because what she wants is different now (again she doesn't tell her, she forces Eve to reflect). They both help each other understand their future better - Eve by pulling V away from what her notion of ""belonging"" means (movies, dancing), and V by helping Eve move past her old sense of identity. 

**The Walk & Line of Separation**

I thought the line between them (clearly visible in the bridge as well as the railing) was a beautiful symbolism of their mirror imagery as well. They've always been each other's mirror reflections - and the show has used mirrors so effectively to show us when they both think about eachother - and even in their scenes together. I thought this was such a fantastic symbolism of the same - because they never cross that line (the image and the object shall never meet) - EXCEPT - when V leans her head back and rests it on Eve. This hair kiss breaks that impossible line of separation (symbolically) - and how appropriate is it that it comes from their hair touching together - when ""Wear it down"" started EVERYTHING. 

The walk too - equal distance (again mirror symbolism) - but most crucially, V walks away first, but stops first too - bringing through their dynamic of push/pull - they'll always be equidistant from one another despite their chase and run, till they finally meet again at the centre. 

&#x200B;

PS: Agree on the song being a shout out to their mutual Sorry Baby! Also - the first para says, ""BE MINE, forever"" - a huge shift from ""You're mine"". Be mine reflects the choice!"
1901,2020-06-10 00:38:43,gzzsoi,This is a fantastic analysis and I felt the same way about a lot of your broad perspectives. Thanks for posting this!
1902,2020-06-10 01:34:56,gzzsoi,"Thank you for a beautiful analysis, I love reading everyone’s take on the symbolism used in cinematography and KE does it so fluently. The use of the bridge in this final scene is extremely poignant - and not only a bridge but a bridge that lifts, thereby separating in two halves to allow larger ships to sail underneath. (This is what makes me feel that E and V will indeed be separated on occasion...on either side of the bridge, so to speak) with their future (the Thames always being a sign of life, of industry, a means to exist) flowing between them but ever constant."
1903,2020-06-10 01:28:12,gzzsoi,This was an amazing analysis! I agree 100% with you. You killed it in your first post!
1904,2020-06-10 07:05:39,gzzsoi,"I am curious, what do you make of the fact that it is nighttime? Do you see any meaning in there?  


I am really unsure, I have not analyzed cinematography before, but I am thinking that it might be linked to the darkness that we have seen rising in Eve. At the same time, it could also be a great symbol of something ending (nice Eve? Eve and V chasing after each other?). Which would then lead to something new, which is what I believe a lot of us would hope to see in season 4: a new form of relationship between Eve and V."
1905,2020-06-11 00:14:13,gzzsoi,"wonderful analysis.     I thought the distance they showed between them also conveyed the work they had to do to be together, but the music they chose showed the emotional links are already there but it would take some steps to recover the distance.

I liked your point about Villanelle not turning around when they were discussing the past.  Good observation.

I agree it was a test to see if Eve would look back.    Villanelle needed confirmation that she would not be rejected.   She wanted to see that when she turned and Eve was there looking at her.   I think they symbolism of the half turn Villanelle did showed almost a protective stance to make sure it was right before proceeding."
1906,2020-06-10 19:56:56,gzzsoi,"Reading all the wonderful comments and contributions down there, and having the word ""water"" repeated so many times, I wanted to also bring up one thing that came to my mind. This is a really personal take, in no way related directly to the show, but that made me think of one of my favorite quotes from Margaret Atwood:

>Water does not resist. Water flows. When you plunge your hand into it, all you feel is a caress. Water is not a solid wall, it will not stop you. But water always goes where it wants to go, and nothing in the end can stand against it. Water is patient. Dripping water wears away a stone. Remember that, my child. Remember you are half water. If you can't go through an obstacle, go around it. Water does.

And I have to say, I am seeing a beautiful possible parallel there with Eve and Villanelle. There is this idea of ""flowing"", which for them would mean not always thinking things through or analyzing them, but still going forward with it. There is this idea of both destruction and this caress, this softness inherent with water. There is this idea of patience, of the time that is required to build something. There is this idea of perseverance. And for me, there is this idea of success, because in way, failure is just not an option, if given enough time."

I hope that you will a spectacular day—thank you again!!!"
1909,2020-06-10 16:13:27,gzzsoi,"I always enjoy reading your analysis. Thank you so much for your eloquent thoughts. Your point about their steady use of reflection and mirrors, literal and symbolic, solidifies what I love about this show. Whether it intended to be or not, I think KE is a deeply philosophical exploration of the self, how we construct ourselves, how we view ourselves in the eyes of others. How the other influences the self. Eve is a perfect example of bad faith, a person who lives their life outwardly one way, but is lying to themselves about themselves and the life they have created. To confront that is interesting and destructive. 

And there is V who on at first appears to be the most authentic person in that she does what she wants when she wants it. She knows who she is. True to her vision of herself, she created her own persona. Peeling back the layers, her boredom, her lack of control over her life, her inability to have and keep meaningful human connection, something we see she wants. Villanelle is just another mask, another layer of self-deception. Reinforced this season by Eve’s insistence that V isn’t just a killing machine. 

They see each other in one another. It isn’t like “i see the same traits I have in you” (but there are plenty) but more “I see you yearning to destroy and create and understand to confront yourself.”"
1910,2020-06-10 07:02:51,gzzsoi,"I have been thinking a lot about the symbolism of mirrors in the whole series, but bringing that scene in as well... Really interesting!"
1911,2020-06-10 12:21:16,gzzsoi,"I love everyone's analyses! ""Hair kiss"" - what a wonderful way to describe it. People say they should have kissed, but they did! In a less obvious and much more poignant way ❤️"
1912,2020-06-10 15:56:56,gzzsoi,"Thank you for reading my analysis and for the tips! Honestly I didn’t really know how it would be formatted when I posted it, but next time I’ll definitely think about breaking up my paragraphs more!! :)

Oh my goodness I’m so happy that you brought up the leap of faith—that’s great because I actually had that phrase written down in my notes for the episode. I hadn’t really thought about the other sections with Villanelle jumping on the gondola with Konstantin or V jumping up and down with Rhian. Those are some great points, and I definitely see how those foreshadowed the bridge scene. 

Whenever they were looking out at the water I thought of it as them contemplating their future together. I feel like it's a very beautiful sentiment just looking at it from a human emotional standpoint. We all have choices and looking towards the broad future can be scary, but at some point it’s good for development to take that leap of faith into the future of uncertainty. They have the choice to walk back to the mundane life. Personally I feel like Eve the scene has already experienced this trend of going from a real high point of excitement and then somewhat I’m not sure I want to describe it as declining but she decided to go back to her mundane life. I’m not sure what’s in store for Villanelle or Eve. I just feel like if Eve were to go back to living her mundane life—then it would seem repetitive. I honestly wish for the best for both Villanelle and Eve. For whatever the future has in store for them.

I love how you said her Villanelle’s comment about the pedestrians being weirdly dressed—I 100% agree that it helped break the tension of the scene and I just love V’s little comments like that. I just find it fascinating how Villanelle is somewhat also the voice of reason in this scene. When Eve says, “What happened to us?”—I thought it interesting how she separated herself both visually and through her commentary “I used to be like them.” I saw this transitioning from the group to her being singular. She had all those things in the past, but I think it’s interesting that Villanelle further divides themselves by saying that Eve was never normal. (Ahh This is hard for me to explain exactly what I’m thinking—I hope this is making sense. But if you need any clarifications I’d be delighted to give them to you!!) Which brings up another sentiment to me—like Eve had this model of normal life that was placed onto her by societal values. “I had a life—I had a husband, a house, a chicken.” All of the things that she listed are all material items that go away—I think Eve is chasing an emotional truth now. (Along with that those material items faded over time for she no longer has those to fall back on) Villanelle is able to pull Eve back in from her wistful affection of the past. When Eve turns completely around—both Villanelle and Eve are on the same level with the shared feeling of what comes next and the building of trust between themselves. 

I love your commentary on the ballroom scene and that you thought of it as both V/Oksana reflecting on her past. I had not thought about it that way, but I love how wonderfully that you described it. Eve does give Villanelle a sense of belonging and I love how you brought up that V/Oksana just wants what the dancing couple had—like that’s how she would want to perceive her future as somewhat normal. “V does the same course correction for Eve by reminding her that reflecting on the past is futile, because what she wants is different now.” You described it so well—I gasped when I read that wow I loved your analysis! Especially how you parallel the two scenes of both the bridge and the ballroom scene—they both through these scenes were able to decide what they wanted next in life and to put the past behind them.

I’ve heard a lot about this mirror image theory and I find it fascinating. The directors did a wonderful job further carrying on the theme of them being a mirror image. I had to go rewatch this scene around 9 times while I was writing this. I love how you described the hair kiss because that was definitely a nod to her saying ‘wear it down’. It’s amazing how such a simple action like that is able to draw so much emotion for it is literally breaking down this invisible barrier between them.

Again thank you so much for reading my analysis—I appreciate that you took the time. I absolutely loved hearing what you had to say and I’d be interested to hear if you had anymore. Sorry that I rambled on for so long! I hope that you will have an amazing day!! Thank you for sharing!"

1914,2020-06-10 02:22:47,gzzsoi,"Thank you, I appreciate that you took the time to read my analysis! Wow I had never really thought about it that way, but it makes sense. I’m honestly not sure what the future has in store for the both of them. Though whatever path they take I just hope in they end they’re both happy.
Have a nice day!! :)"
1915,2020-06-10 02:07:42,gzzsoi,Aww I’m  so glad that you enjoyed it—thank you for taking the time to read my analysis!! I hope that you will have a wonderful day!
1916,2020-06-10 07:32:47,gzzsoi,"I’ve been thinking about the choice to set the scene at night also. I think it was perfect and I agree with your interpretation that it is symbolic of the finality of one day (the end of the old relationship both with themselves and each other and how they see their futures, the darkness, the necessity of it) but the predictability of a new one to come. Without night, there can be no day, night births morning and a fresh beginning."
1917,2020-06-10 13:10:17,gzzsoi,"That’s a really interesting thought because I’ve been rather curious about the darkness that is consuming Eve. One thing that you just made me realize is how the costume designers dressed Villanelle in this bright yellow (or orange I can’t tell which color it is) overcoat outfit and Eve is wearing very muted dark colors. I understand that Eve has always had this rather muted color palette, but visually watching this at night I felt like the contrast was amplified in the darkness. We’ve seen Villanelle wear solid colors in the past-specifically that red jumpsuit in the finale of season 2. Usually red is very much a dominant emotion that has associations with passion, danger, and intensity. I feel at the end of season 2 emotionally that is where Villanelle stood. Now fast forwarding to the Finale of season 3–I think it’s an interesting choice that they choice to dress her in solid colors for two season finales in a row. The symbolism of yellow has a much more positive emotions associated to the color. Some identifying characteristics that stood out to me are loyalty, energy, optimism, enlightenment, and freshness. I think that is very telling visually as we look at this—possibly Villanelle is opening up more and Eve is starting to fade more into the darkness. I’m not sure, but Eve in this scene because of the dark muted colors she was wearing—she sorta blended in to the darkness. Which is the opposite of Villanelle who definitely stands out wearing bright yellow.  I’m not quite sure what this means as a form of any sort of relationship for them. But I just thought it was an interesting scene visually—especially when you cross examine to prior seasons.  Sorry I got a little side tracked, anyways back to the symbolism of the nighttime. Darkness and nighttime have so many different symbols to uncover honestly. One that really stuck out to me was sometimes writers use Night to symbolize the uncertainty and unknown in a situation. Like we have these two characters Villanelle and Eve in this scene. Both of them are not quite sure what the next move is in the situation. The darkness amplifies this notion somewhat to me. 
Darkness can often also mean an absence of light-which is another reason why I thought it was interesting how Villanelle was dressed in this sort of sunshine yellow. I thought of it also possibly a way of Oksana being allowed to come out for us to see a much more emotional/softer side of her. Also I liked your question about Eve and V chasing each other. Sometimes darkness also can symbolize the end of something. I hope this is helpful—I’m sorry that I jumped around so much but your question really interested me and allowed to contemplate the scene in a different way. I’m not completely sure what to make of these symbols as far as the future of both of them. Though based on the visual representations present in the scene—I felt like it attributed a lot to their character growth. 
Anyways thank you so much for taking the time to read my analysis! Sorry that I rambled on for so long, I hope that it makes sense.
Have a very nice day and I’d love to answer anymore questions if you have them!!"
1918,2020-06-11 06:33:14,gzzsoi,"On that last part, of V turning, I totally saw that as well, how she only half turned. But, I believe that in the last moments, she has completely turned to face Eve, which could mean she gives up on trying to protect herself and opens up. That would be a huge risk for her, but would be in-line with how she has evolved in season 3."
1919,2020-06-10 23:41:07,gzzsoi,Ahh I love Margaret Atwood’s writings!! Yes thank you for relating this quote to the show—I can totally see this between Villanelle and Eve. I think it’s interesting how they’re able to have all those elements. Wow that was fascinating! Great analysis!!
1920,2020-06-10 16:21:51,gzzsoi,"Thank you so much! 

And thank you for sharing such a beautiful articulation of how Eve and V view themselves and what their drive is for another. You are absolutely right - I think what starts with, I see myself in you, is slowly morphing into, I see your cage, and we both need to be free. It's a more optimistic and less tragic interpretation, and I really hope that that's where the show takes it."
1921,2020-06-10 12:23:33,gzzsoi,Yes! And they closed their eyes for this as well :)
1922,2020-06-10 16:15:54,gzzsoi,"You have such an adorable vibe, virtual hug!

Agree with all your thoughts, and thank you so much for appreciating mine :). 

Also, neither of them are going back to their past lives! I am pretty sure a team up is happening in S4 premiere! We're gonna get post Corona just desserts!"
1923,2020-06-10 00:49:38,gzzsoi,"Likewise 😀
p.s. you KILLED your first post in reddit"
1924,2020-06-10 02:16:11,gzzsoi,"Likewise! You really put into words everything I felt watching that scene, specifically when you address the past-present-future matter. And how the director used the bridge and that song omg. I think it was beautiful. Thank you!! Have a great day too!"
1925,2020-06-10 14:51:51,gzzsoi,"My my, you got me thinking about that coat, and it brought up so many things! I'm going to say it's yellow, to avoid saying orange/yellow all the time. But here it goes. And it's probably going to raise more questions than answer them, but this is very much my thinking in real time 

You said it: this is a sunshine-colored coat. What if V is the next morning? What if that is a symbol there?

On a different point, you mentioned V being in red last season, and this being such an intense color with all it's meanings. This coat is a lighter version of red. This could be a symbol of how V has evolved, become ""less intense"" in a way (although I don't really like that way of putting it).

In parallel, Eve is wearing even darker colors that last season...

And please, don't apologize for rambling nor writing very long messages, I am loving this!"
1926,2020-06-11 14:35:03,gzzsoi,"I think at first it was a half turn and then fully around.   So does that mean ""caution""?"
1927,2020-06-11 06:35:27,gzzsoi,"Yay, glad you could relate to that as well, cause it was really a light-bulb moment, and I was wondering if that was just random or not. But even if it is, I am still thinking about this and what it could mean!"
1928,2020-06-10 16:30:49,gzzsoi,"There is something weirdly optimistic about a person deciding to completely destroy their lives, not for happiness, (as Eve says who says I want to be happy), but to have an authentic experience of herself."
1929,2020-06-10 17:51:17,gzzsoi,"Aww thank you, virtual hug to you too!! :)

Thank goodness that they’re not going back—I’m honestly very excited to see what comes next for them! I’m thrilled that Laura Neal is going to be the head writer of season 4—I think that she could possibly take the show in a new direction. So that definitely makes me very hopeful!!
Woohoo cheers! I can’t wait for post Corona desserts!!"
1930,2020-06-10 02:27:27,gzzsoi,Haha I just noticed that pun—that brightened my day thank you! 😂💓
1931,2020-06-10 17:19:56,gzzsoi,"Right I totally get what you’re saying!! Wait a minute as I read your analysis of the sunshine yellow coat—it honestly really got me thinking. I liked what you had say about the morning. When I read that over again I started to think about the interaction that Villanelle had with her mother, “You are the darkness. You have always been the darkness. You weren’t scared of me, you were sick of me. You knew I could see what you were.” At this point I do believe that ever character in this show has darkness—except sometimes darkness is thrust upon people more than others. 

People have framed Villanelle’s character for being this agent of chaos. Which I feel like this perpetuation of telling Villanelle who she is has somewhat made her lost—I don’t think she wants to be this poster model of destruction anymore. I’m not trying to discount the terrible things she has done. But instead I think Villanelle wants to frame a new identity for herself and find a sense of belonging in this world. I somewhat think the sunshine yellow is almost like an act of rebranding herself and her image. 

I definitely agree that is possibly a sign of her evolution. Throughout this season we sorta saw a new side of V/Oksana where she played a little in the nostalgia/longing for the past. Whether it be asking Konstantin how she looked as a baby or visiting her family. All of those people had a certain image of who Villanelle was and I’d say even the audience has there own interpretations of who she is. I’m not even sure who she wants to be but definitely through the bridge/ballroom scenes we get more insight on what they desire for their futures. Also yes! It did seem like Eve was wearing darker colors than prior seasons. Which I would say that Eve has also gone through an evolution this season along with a healing process. I’m not sure if next season dark Eve will come out more, but I’m excited to see!!
Thank you for taking the time to reply! This is a great conversation!!"
1932,2020-06-11 17:22:08,gzzsoi,"I think it means she was being cautious, but then she saw that Eve had turned and V just threw caution to the wind."
1933,2020-06-10 16:39:20,gzzsoi,"Yup, exactly. And KE is such a path breaking show in so many ways, I can't imagine them not celebrating an authentic homecoming in a sense. So, I am really hoping they take that route, because that reversal of, ""toxic, addictive, mutually destructive, tragic"" tale to one where you find someone who helps you find your authenticity will be both unexpected (given how they've marketed it throughout and how it's perceived by the critics and even the fans) and really in line with how the show itself is."
1934,2020-06-10 19:48:21,gzzsoi,"Oh yes, that is exactly the point Eve makes about everyone having monsters inside!

I agree with what you are saying about this framing of V and her rebelling against this. We can clearly see it with her reaction to Hélène when she calls her a ""beautiful monster."" Immediately, V is taken aback, she doesn't seem to like that at all. Then, of course, she brings it up and asks Eve about it, wondering if she is a monster.

I believe a big part of V's evolution, and probably the most necessary and important part, has been her figuring out that she can and does feel things. Everyone operated under the assumption that she couldn't, that she was indeed a psychopath and that she didn't care, or even went as far as enjoyed killing. But I think that through her rejecting all the ideas that were imposed on her - by her mother, the Twelve, Konstantin... - she is freeing herself and allowing herself to believe that she can have feelings. At that point, Eve accepting her might just be enough, because she could just ignore other people.

How do you believe Eve has healed this season? I mean, in what way/direction, but also what has led her to heal?"
1935,2020-06-11 18:21:28,gzzsoi,"And that melted all our hearts.    With the background song they were playing, how could anyone not put a romantic context to it."
1936,2020-06-10 17:08:09,gzzsoi,"Right! I have never seen anything quite like this in TV, and this show sort of follows its own philosophy in a way by creating and destroying and recreating itself (like its main characters) every season by having different show runners and writers to varying degrees of success. Like the characters. I too hope that they flip that narrative. Maybe they have started. The bridge scene certainly lays the groundwork for it."
1937,2020-06-10 21:29:08,gzzsoi,"Right! I definitely feel that Villanelle is now rejecting all of the ideas that people have imposed on her. Like as you said her mother, the Twelve, Konstantin, and Carolyn. They all had a certain idea of who Villanelle was and who they wanted her to be. Right I think I may do another analysis soon from ‘Are you from Pinner’ since that was my favorite episode of the series. I really want to explore her relationships with her family. Also what you said about Eve—I think that Villanelle has some sort of understanding of her own self image. Which another reason why I think she has been fighting this inner battle between who she wants to be and the Villanelle that others impose on her. By Eve accepting her—Villanelle is able to further accept the self image of who she sees herself as. Not a monster.

I saw a interview with Sandra Oh and I agreed with a lot of the points she made about this season. She needed to heal after Villanelle had shot her. Which we were able to see an entirely side of Eve and honestly she was a lot more strong/independent. At the beginning of the season really required her stop and heal. When she is working at the Korean restaurant it’s somewhat soothing to her the repetitive motion of folding the Mandu (dumplings). When she is working in the restaurant, she is just able to fade into the background. And possibly just ignore all of her thoughts that keep her up at night. I mean it was probably pretty traumatic for her to be shot by Villanelle. Along with that another sign of healing was how Eve could deny both Kenny and Carolyn’s requests for her to continue investigating. Which like in prior seasons she probably would have went straight back in. Though she really needed this time to continue to heal from her trauma. I’m not sure if this makes sense, but if you want I can send you the interview!! I thought it was really interesting!
Thank you so much—I’ve really have been enjoying these conversations!"
1938,2020-06-12 06:06:14,gzzsoi,"Oh yes... Although at first, I was just agitated and almost screaming, ""No, turn around!"" that I didn't notice the music ha ha."
1939,2020-06-10 17:15:12,gzzsoi,"Agreed! It's such a bold move to actively move away from just obsession and actually dare to explore ""love"". To be completely honest, not many other avenues were left for them to explore  if they wanted to continue the show - but even then, haha. 

Hoping Sally is ballsy enough to weather the critique that they went too deep into fan servicing, because you can bet that that's the narrative the critics will take. Unless they do somehow find a spectacular way of delivering that ending, which probably only PWB is capable of, but who knows? She was discovefed too, and maybe their final season showrunner really kills it!"
1940,2020-06-11 06:43:50,gzzsoi,"> By Eve accepting her—Villanelle is able to further accept the self image of who she sees herself as. Not a monster. 

Yes! This is just the external validation she needed to be able to grow and gain some confidence in her humanity.

I look forward to seeing your analysis of Are You from Pinner! I gotta say I might rewatch the entire season 3, which I haven't done properly since all the episodes came out. Like with other seasons, there's probably a lot to catch in terms of symbolism and foreshadowing now that the entire season is out. Plus links with other seasons. As someone said in another post, Suzanne Heathcote is a master with details.

Yes, definitely interested in the interview!

And I really like how that process of healing has looked like for Eve. It might have been expected that she would just ""fix"" herself and completely stir away from V. And she has tried, but we can see when she chats with Kenny that it didn't work. In a way, she seems to have, maybe not consciously, come to the realization that it's better to live a dangerous life that might bring in pain, potentially even killing her, than to die slowly in a normal and boring life that does not suit her.

Same here, loving your perspectives and being able to read and send long-winded comments!"
1941,2020-06-10 18:04:38,gzzsoi,"I agree. Their relationship has to change, and “love” is certainly a multifaceted idea/thing for them to add. Or better yet, the idea of care. To care for each other goes back to this “let us both be free” and help foster that in one another. 

Whether that is fan service, I guess that is a manner of opinion. I don’t think it would be because it has always been about their relationship. But presentation is so important. It would be difficult work, but I am here for it."
1942,2020-06-11 16:09:00,gzzsoi,"I love how you described it as external validation—that’s an awesome way to describe it!!

Along that me too! I feel like there are still so many details that in missed not only in the 3rd season, but also seasons prior. If you see any thing else while you’re rewatching I’d love to hear about it!! YES SUZANNE HEATHCOTE IS THE MASTER OF DETAILS!

I think that Eve also is just at a point where she simply cannot escape this life. She must face it—she must face Villanelle. Every time that she has attempted to separate herself from this life, it would bring her back in. I agree, I think somewhat she is coming to the realization that her life will never be ‘normal’ again, and anyways she was never been normal either. Which to some extent—I don’t want to say that Eve is entirely turning dark, but she is becoming more comfortable with the presence of her monsters. Along with this I feel that Villanelle has also somewhat in a way given Eve more freedom to be herself without ‘judgement’. 

Thank you for having these conversations! These conversations have definitely brightened my day. I love hearing your perspectives and I’m glad that you’ve been able to share them!! 
I’ll have to go find the link, but I’ll make sure to send you the interview with the specific time stamps.
I hope that you will have a wonderful day!!"
1943,2020-06-11 17:30:11,gzzsoi,"Thanks!

Totally agree that Eve cannot escape anymore, or this would destroy her. Also, I think there can be a lot of power in knowing, then taming your inner monster, because you can then control it (up to a certain point) and benefit from it - this can be such a powerful drive and a huge strength!

And yes, I think that a lot of emphasis has been put on Eve accepting V because that is relatively new and everyone thought V was a monster - so could not be accepted nor loved. But V is also accepting Eve fully. It's just that it's more subtle in a sense because Eve was not outwardly craving for that because she was pretending to be normal and to enjoy that life.

Count on me to send anything I notice your way, and please return the favor! I've really been enjoying exchanging with you! Enjoy your day!"
1944,2020-06-09 19:41:44,gztww0,"I've always had an issue with this interview  (the OG from Gay Times this article is referencing) that was published last year.

The full quote from Sandra says ""“You guys are tricky because you want to make it into something… but it just isn’t,” Sandra said on the phone from New York. **“That’s also why I think sexuality and discovery of the wider reaches of sexuality is the theme of the show – why it’s interesting to people. It’s not one thing or another.”**

First of all, it is unclear what exactly is she talking about in the first sentence, I think the writer of the article did a poor job with explaining it (and honestly made a bigger deal about it than what it is imo). Secondly, she clearly says in her second sentence that **""sexuality and discovery of the wider reaches of sexuality is the theme of the show""**. She then says **""The fluidity**, even in the questioning that I know Eve really really carries, **is what I think people can truly relate to. We are not saying one thing or another because people are not one thing or another.”**

I think all she meant is that they don't want to put labels on the characters which is a very modern approach and I applaud it. Bottom line, the show speaks for itself. I do understand the frustration of wanting to call things a certain way (justified by the past of queer baiting we have been subjected from tv shows), but at the same time I think we should appreciate the will to move past that and have a show that is truly inclusive."
1945,2020-06-09 19:31:07,gztww0,"Well... it’s from 2019, so hopefully she feels a different way about this now? 

I’m at a point where I don’t care about what they say on interviews anymore... At the end of the day, the show is obviously going for romance and that’s what matters to me. And after S3, KE can’t go on without exploring a romantic relationship. They may not end up together, but they can’t deny anymore that they have something. 

Sometimes I think they do interviews like this to keep the more conservative part of the audience. Seriously. It makes no sense to say they will never have something. They already do. It’s like having an emotional affair? Just because you don’t kiss doesn’t mean there’s nothing going on. And they actually did kiss, so..."
1946,2020-06-09 19:27:56,gztww0,"""Villanelle masturbates over Eve all the time. They have ear piece sex. Villanelle tells Eve she is in love with her...but apparently there is nothing gay about any of that"" I 100% agree with that tweet. I agree that Oh and Comer tend to erase the gay part of KE in their interview. It's not correct. The show is based on a book and the book is clear about E and V relationship. The reason is maybe because they don't want to make the show all about it. Probably because straight male wouldn't want to watch the show if it was labeled as lesbian romance... It is not correct but I don't think it is the actresses fault. They probably signed an agreement regarding what they can and can't  tell about the show."
1947,2020-06-09 21:24:33,gztww0,"I feel like a lot of queer KE fans subconsciously try to find reasons to prove that the show is queer baiting. I don’t really understand the point of over analyzing and dissecting everything that Sandra and Jodie says when, to me, the show very explicitly revolves around V and Eve’s obsession and attraction to each other. Like there are a million scenes depicting that yet there’s this constant worry within the fandom that they’re going to make the show “straight.” I get that we all have PTSD from past shows with WLW characters that have ended horribly but I feel like we shouldn’t even compare Killing Eve to those shows because 1) the relationship in this show is canon 2) their relationship is more complex and complicated than a normal relationship. 

Also I think it’s important to remember that one of the main points of the show thus far has been Eve’s internal conflict with trying to desperately hold on to normalcy versus her desire for “darkness”. Now that the season 3 finale ended the way it did, the writers can now explore their relationship more in season 4. Now if they fail to do that in the next season then I’ll understand the complaints but for now I find the concern lowkey annoying. Based on the new show-runner plus the lesbian-identifying writer that just joined the team, I’m excited to see what they do next season."
1948,2020-06-09 20:18:57,gztww0,"I still think they say things to throw people off the scent. 

 In the books the characters do have a relationship so what is the justification of not putting it in the show?"
1949,2020-06-09 22:15:28,gztww0,"Can I just say that this series is based off of the books. The books in which these exact characters come from. The books from which these characters end up in a very intense, romantic relationship in every way.... 🤓🍾"
1950,2020-06-10 04:39:34,gztww0,"I don't think it's queerbaiting - it's been instrumental in me accepting fluidity (the very thing Sandra mentions) as an inherent part of personal dynamics and relationships. It's a brilliant and true to world depiction (perhaps even is set in a hyper idealistic space because no one even pretends that the same sex aspect of the Villaneve dynamic is the issue). I don't get people who rant and rave about it - it's a blessing, this show, in how it treats sexuality and looks past the labels to always focus on people."

1952,2020-06-09 22:00:46,gztww0,"To me V is bisexual (with a huge preference for women emotionally). 

Eve might be a biromantic hetrosexual.

But I can understand how Oh prefers to keep it ""fluid"" since labels can confuse and anger some people."
1953,2020-06-09 19:47:35,gztww0,"If this is what she meant then i 100% agree with that. My fear is what someone below said which is they are still trying to appeal to a conservative audience. And if they don't progress the relationship in s4 I'll be convinced that's what they're doing. I just want these characters to be true to themselves and how they actually feel about each other. If I have to watch one more scene where Eve gets that puzzled, confused look on her face when someone addresses her feelings for V i may set the TV on fire 😂"
1954,2020-06-09 19:37:10,gztww0,"But even in 2019 the earpiece sex had already happened. And yes, what you said about appealing to the conservative audience is what I'm afraid of. They are going to write themselves in a corner trying to do both. It does become queer baiting if at the end of the day they are too scared to fully go there. That they would rather appeal to that base than be true to these characters and how they've been portrayed to actually feel about each other. The story is going to end up making no sense to anyone."
1955,2020-06-09 19:37:07,gztww0,"Agree to all your points. Someone made a joke that KE is “straightbaiting” and I have to say it seems right, like they are trying to keep part of the audience that wouldn’t feel comfortable with a lesbian romance...

I’ve said many times that I understand their reluctance in saying it’s a romance/love story, because V’s a killer and all that. But fully denying the sexual tension is another thing entirety."
1956,2020-06-09 19:47:02,gztww0,"Of course they think it's gay. They made it! Believe me they are 100% on that ship. They just don't want to **label it** as being Lesbian. All Sandra was saying is that they want to keep things fluid, they never said it was not gay."
1957,2020-06-09 22:15:50,gztww0,Omg there is lesbian writer?! Who where what when?! I know why!
1958,2020-06-10 04:57:29,gztww0,I can absolutely see this and appreciate you sharing your thoughts. It helps me to see different sides to it 😊
1959,2020-06-09 22:22:27,gztww0,Eve had sex while listening to V masturbating... She's definetly bi imo. They both are.
1960,2020-06-09 19:52:29,gztww0,">appeal to a conservative audience

I don't think KE is targeted to that audience though. The show has been queer from the very start, it is part of its DNA. The creators and PWB have proven to literally not give a damn about any conventions, they subverted everything we are used to see in the genre (how we see women, power, sex, etc..). So to me this whole controversy doesn't hold up."
1961,2020-06-09 19:40:59,gztww0,Lol I just replied to a comment below its queer baiting and then read you said its straight baiting 😂 thats the messed up part about the whole thing though. It's technically both! They are trying to ride this line so everyone's happy but it isn't going to work. Its just going to end up not making any sense to anyone at the end of the day. They're going to have to make a decision.
1962,2020-06-09 19:40:16,gztww0,"Haha ""straightbaiting"" I love that!"
1963,2020-06-09 19:54:48,gztww0,I didn't say they say it wasn't gay (weird sentence 😂) . I just say they tend to erase the gay part of KE so to keep the straight male viewers. I agree that they both know it is.
1964,2020-06-09 22:42:59,gztww0,"Her name is Kayleigh Llewellyn! 
Here’s a quote from this article (https://network.bfi.org.uk/news-and-features/industry-insights/kayleigh-llewellyn-how-i-made-it-tv-screenwriter) that I especially liked:

<I grew up with no real queer scene, and would have loved to watch a show like In My Skin as a teen. What does it mean to you to have a young gay woman at the centre of your story, and to reach those audiences?> 

It means absolutely everything. I was exactly the same as you - I was dying to see myself represented on screen. I’m 33 now, and it hasn’t really changed that much. It’s really interesting seeing the way that LGBTQ audiences respond to a show like Killing Eve because we’re so loyal. We’ve been so starved of seeing ourselves on screen that when it comes we’re obsessed with it, we’re just like, ‘thank you, thank you, thank you, finally something!’ I really wanted to make the show I wish I’d been able to see when I was younger. And I wanted to do something closer to my experience. There were shows like Skins, which was incredible, but it’s so sexy, and everyone’s like so grown up."
1965,2020-06-10 08:17:25,gztww0,She always has sex with a man though.
1966,2020-06-09 20:02:48,gztww0,"Thank you for sharing your opinions, you make a lot of sense. I think a part of me tries to prepare myself in case they never fully commit to it, despite all the progress they've made especially in that finale. I like hearing everyones different takes on it."
1967,2020-06-09 19:47:19,gztww0,"Sorry but to me KE is not queerbaiting. The fact that the lead actresses refuse to talk about gay relationship doesn't mean the show do the same. S1 and S2 includes gay sexuality (masturbation, phone sex, V having sex with several women) and relationship (V said I love you to E). Even S3  it includes a kiss between V and E and the two dancing together. KE is definitely not queerbaiting, at least not in my opinion... But I agree that the actresses (and writer and producer) are maybe doing both (queerbaiting and straightbaiting if that even exist) so to keep all the viewers..."
1968,2020-06-09 20:17:03,gztww0,"I don't know many men who actually watch it tbh. Most guys I know say they find it boring. It seems to be watched mostly by women, gay and straight. At least most women I know are obsessed with it!"
1969,2020-06-09 19:59:39,gztww0,"😂 I don't think they want erase the gayness though, it's the queerest show of queer shows! But I do hope that by the end of if they will just scream it from the top of their lungs so we can all be at peace!"
1970,2020-06-09 22:48:18,gztww0,Wow I love that! Thanks for sharing I had no idea she was a writer for the next season!
1971,2020-06-10 08:28:00,gztww0,So? Bisexualiy is a sexual orientation and is not based on sexual experience. We don't expect straight people to have sex to be straight so it's the same for ssa person
1972,2020-06-09 20:30:13,gztww0,"I can totally relate. There is always that sense of potential letdown. In this case, I don’t think they will disappoint us. Now the ending may rip us to shreds, however..."
1973,2020-06-09 19:51:05,gztww0,No i agree with you. But the actors have a lot of say in what happens to these characters. They pushed back in season 1 because they didnt want them to be intimate and they got their way. There's been several things that came out where it was written one way but the actors disagreed so they changed it. I think thats maybe where some of my worry is coming from. They need to get on board with how its evolving more than anyone.
1974,2020-06-09 20:21:00,gztww0,Good point. I don't know either if some men watch KE. I'm sure there are some but same as you it seems clear to me  that women are the majority of the viewer by far. In general I think men are not interested in women characters 🙄 especially complex one...
1975,2020-06-09 20:32:27,gztww0,Really? I heard Fiona Shaw say in an interview that she loves how many men watch the show and find it interesting.
1976,2020-06-10 08:06:16,gztww0,I know quite a few including me.
1977,2020-06-09 20:11:00,gztww0,Lolol this is what I'm saying. Is that too much to ask? 😝
1978,2020-06-09 20:04:39,gztww0,I hope too!
1979,2020-06-10 09:50:38,gztww0,"Women can get turned on by the idea of/ or images of women having sex, but they have no interest in doing it themselves. It's asymmetrical desire. Which is why I suggested Eve is biromantic, but heterosexual. And again, labels can confuse and annoy others which is why I agree with Sandra that its not a good idea."
1980,2020-06-09 20:38:08,gztww0,Oh I have no doubt that I won't be recovering from the ending! On another note though... Your username is amazing 😂
1981,2020-06-09 20:02:38,gztww0,Oh so you think the actresses push back the gay part of KE? Wow I hope not! But I agree that they should be more clear about how the relationship of E and V evolved. Maybe after S4 aired they will be more clear about that
1982,2020-06-10 08:38:11,gztww0,That's good to know! I was only going off of the guys I know personally.
1983,2020-06-10 10:11:45,gztww0,"If you are attracted to both men and women you are bisexual. If you are not attracted to both men and women you are not bisexual. It's simple. Why the need to erase bisexuality by splitting bisexuals into sub categories with some artificial distinction between romantic and sexual desire? And I disagree with Sandra Oh, labelling correctly matters. Anyway whatever we are out of context regarding KE. 🙂"
1984,2020-06-09 20:39:59,gztww0,Thanks!
1985,2020-06-09 20:09:01,gztww0,"Yes I have always gotten that vibe, from especially Sandra. It's as if she feels like fully pursuing a romantic relationship takes something away from the depth of it. Like it would just make it about that and all of a sudden they wouldn't be these complex, multi faceted characters anymore. And I completely disagree. It just adds even more. They can write it in a way where it doesn't just become about that."
1986,2020-06-09 22:11:17,gztww0,They for sure do
1987,2020-06-10 12:10:28,gztww0,"Case in point.
No one is ""erasing"" or denying bisexuality. In fact, you have just casually invalidated those whose romantic orientation does not match their sexual orientation by labelling them as artificial.

You realise this is exactly what you dont want others to do to you. Even if you cant comprehend it, it doesnt make it less real for others who feel that way. Live and let live my friends."
1988,2020-06-09 20:13:01,gztww0,I agree with you. Making E and V in a romantic relationship wouldn't end the complexity of their relationship and characters. It would be the opposite. I really hope S4 will explore E and V together as a couple..
1989,2020-06-09 22:26:22,gztww0,But when they were casted as Eve and Villanelle they both knew it was based on a book about two women being in a romantic relationship... So why push back now?
1990,2020-06-10 12:27:34,gztww0,Ugh?I was talking about eve not about other people. You are the one who labeled eve who is a bisexual character (it's not me it's from the book) an heterosexual one. This is erasure. Of course people can have romantic attraction without sexual attraction. I'm not invalidating anyone thank you
1991,2020-06-10 00:44:25,gztww0,"When they were cast, the second and third books weren't out yet, so they technically had no idea that they would have a romantic relationship in the books.  

That being said, I personally don't think either one of them actually has any problem with playing a queer character.

At the end of season 1, Eve is still carrying a lot of grief and anger towards Villanelle, so I think Jodie and Sandra both thought that it would make no sense for that final scene to be more intimate than it is, especially from Eve's perspective.  Villanelle just assumes that Eve wants to have sex with her because she said she thinks about her all the time.
Really, the season 1 finale is the first time we really see Eve start fighting with her desire for Villanelle and her desire for a normal life."
1992,2020-06-10 13:53:09,gztww0,"Biromantic heterosexual was my interpretation of TV Eve. The book and the series differ in a lot of areas.
You contradicted yourself by exposing your ignorance and or misunderstanding of my view by saying ""splitting bisexuals into sub categories with some artificial distinction between romantic and sexual desire?"", then saying ""Of course people can have romantic attraction without sexual attraction.""
The same goes the other way. There are those who are bisexual but aromantic. This is why people dont like labels, because there are aggressive people out there like you ready to argue when theres absolutely no need."
1993,2020-06-10 06:58:47,gztww0,"I didn't know they were cast before book #2 and #3. Thanks for the information. I think technically they don't have any problem to play ssa character, they are actresses after all so they probably are ready to play lots of different characters. But the way they talk about E and V relationship in interviews makes me think they might not be 100% comfortable with it. They are most probably straight so that could explain.. I don't know. But I agree with you S1 finale was perfect."

2018,2020-06-29 23:28:41,hi96j7,I often wondered if they actually shot two endings to this scene and was one intimate and the other one was stabbing. Would love to see what ended up on cutting room floor.

2022,2020-06-30 01:36:32,hi96j7,one of my *favourite* onset pictures is [the bus scene!](https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/KE_303_POSTBTS_1920x1080.jpg)
2023,2020-06-29 22:22:24,hi96j7,Right? Usually on more intimate scenes very few people are on set to create a private space so that the actors feel relaxed and comfortable. It's called a closed set and I hope they will do that in season 4.
2024,2020-06-29 22:03:32,hi96j7,I just watched that yesterday (doing my first KE rewatch) and I noticed she also copied the woman’s smile and nervous laugh.  I think this is some of the “patterning” we are Villanelle do in the early episodes of season 1.
2025,2020-06-29 23:31:07,hi96j7,"This kisses with Pamela were intense and hot. Don’t get me wrong, I loved the bus kiss but it felt a bit awkward to me."
2026,2020-06-30 17:35:13,hi96j7,"I remember them saying the ending was rewritten by Phoebe all the way up til filming, and it was written to be closer than they actually were - but it didn't end that way because it didn't feel right to the characters are the time. I wonder too if that was filmed or just talked about, super interesting!"
2027,2020-06-30 00:58:30,hi96j7,"in Graham Norton, Sam L Jackson and Keira Knightley talked about how sex scenes are always filmed with many people on set. The director would be directing you fucking someone against the bookshelves while the crews are behind eating burger and peeking loll.

Because of Covid restriction, in Jodie new project ""Talking Heads"" she talked about how she can't focus, and its the ""hardest thing she's ever done"" not only because of the long monologue but also the quietness of the set (i think only like 2 people are present). She said she is so used to crowded/loud set that when it's her alone, it feels really out of place.

Actors tend to find their own focus and peace to get into the character while filming in a loud set, I think they're used to it. So when they are suddenly transported into a quiet set, they found it unsettling, or at least Jodie did. But I know in other films, for intimate scenes, some directors give their actors space and lessen the crew on set."
2028,2020-06-30 01:49:40,hi96j7,"What a wonderful shot! If I were one of the extras in the background, they'd never get a good take because I would be squealing and sighing and fangirling."
2029,2020-06-30 01:38:05,hi96j7,"Gah I love watching Villanelle try to pick up on and mimic the mannerisms from other people during that first season! 

The very first scene with her smiling at the little girl in the ice cream shop is amazing insight in just the first few minutes."
2030,2020-06-29 23:35:13,hi96j7,Because the bus kiss was never intended to be intense and hot. It was a power play from Eve.
2031,2020-06-30 17:33:36,hi96j7,"The bus kiss was supposed to be awkward, I think we were supposed to feel it from Eve's perspective. The reason it was messy and wide-eyed was because her impulse took over, I don't think she expected herself to do that. Then, V reacted similarly because she was shocked herself."
2032,2020-06-30 21:08:57,hi96j7,Yes the sexual tension in that scene was tremendous. I loved how Jodie played Villanelle in that scene as she slowly starts to let her guard down and open up a little more. But I think it was too soon for them to share any kind of intimacy at that point.
2033,2020-06-30 01:32:31,hi96j7,"> she talked about how she can't focus, and its the ""hardest thing she's ever done"" not only because of the long monologue but also the quietness of the set 

oooh interesting tidbit! It truly must be *so* jarring when you're used to the hustle and bustle of the set with like 70+ people to suddenly be relegated to like 2 other people on set."
2034,2020-06-30 03:54:25,hi96j7,"In my experience there is always a closed set for intimate scenes. Grips set up a closed area around the video playback area where the director, script supervisor, DP, Gaffer sit to watch. All other crew save for camera clear the set. Sometimes they set up an additional closed video area for hair, make up and wardrobe."

Her Idol play speech was very good and was the middle between parvati/Dani want to be in the final 3 with her and Jerry/Russell want to be her 3rd."
2045,2020-06-29 04:00:36,hhsu5s,"I’ve always really liked Sandras HvV game! It was smart of her to recognize that keeping the illusion of wanting to work with the heroes while remaining to vote with Russell allowed her to make it to the end and win over the whole jury, which Parvati didn’t recognize, giving Sandra the win!"
2046,2020-06-29 04:18:34,hhsu5s,She played a solid game and deserved it even if I wish Parv could have won.
2047,2020-06-29 05:04:28,hhsu5s,It wasn’t pretty but she made it work and I think that’s a valid way of winning. She tried the majority alliance with the villains. When that collapsed she tried to rally the heroes and they were too stupid. She openly told Russell she hated him so it’s not like she was deceitful or awful to people. And they were still silly enough to let her go to the end. She got to the end anyway she could. There’s no rule that you have to be a challenge beast to win.
2048,2020-06-29 05:12:33,hhsu5s,"I ALSO just finished my first rewatch in 10 years today, and I totally agree with what you’re getting at. I thought Sandra fully didn’t deserve the win this season over Parvati, but upon the rewatch, you really see how crucial jury management and friendship are in the game. On two completely polar ends of the spectrum, you have Sandra, who had friends on the jury and tried to work with them throughout the game, and Russell, who’s overconfidence and spineless gameplay cost him the win twice. 

Still think overall that Parv played a better game in outwit, outplay, and outlast."
2049,2020-06-29 04:35:45,hhsu5s,What was in the exit interviews
2050,2020-06-29 05:08:10,hhsu5s,"Was she really in the middle between Parv/Dani and Russ/Jerri? 

I’m pretty sure Parv/Dani/Russ were a threesome with Jerri as their fourth and Sandra clearly on the bottom. That’s why she wanted to flip to the Heroes at F10 and F9."
2051,2020-06-29 04:10:43,hhsu5s,"Even if she really wanted to work with the heroes, which we will never know what Sandra was really thinking, the fact that she always recognized that she didn't have the numbers and went back to her alliance every time is actually really smart and super good play too."
2052,2020-06-29 04:05:27,hhsu5s,"Absolutely. She never stirred the pot like Russ or Parv was perceived to by the jury, working with the hero’s but not totally flippping was a very tricky line. Like what happened to Candice could’ve totally happened to Sandra in how flipping making you an instant target"
2053,2020-06-29 04:48:21,hhsu5s,"I cant find all of her old interviews but from one of them here are some good parts:

She talks about how she recognized Russell was a goat and the jury would view him and Parvati similarly and so she stopped targeting Russell.

She talks about how she tried to keep Parvati safe in the game to use as a shield because she knew they were going after the winners and she figured she would be there as long as Parvati was.

I also remember her saying she would often play up to Russell's ego because she recognized very quickly how narcissistic he was. Like whenever he would put her down she would buy into and say...yes Russell I'm weak nobody will ever vote for me at the end."
2054,2020-06-29 05:18:13,hhsu5s,Which lead to the final 8 in which the tension with Dani and Russell really started (hinted at all those secret confessional) and Dani/Parvati saw Russell as an outlier but need the heroes gone. Jerri easily linked with Russell thinking she can beat him with not really close to the two girls. Russell wanted options but never considered taking a hero to the end. Sandra doesn't care just as long as it ain't her.
2055,2020-06-29 06:03:16,hhsu5s,"And if the numbers were there, I have no doubt she could play her way to a F3 and still have a chance at a win against say Candice and Rupert."
2056,2020-06-29 04:50:40,hhsu5s,God damn that’s brilliant. I was ten years old the first time I saw HvV never would’ve picked up on this. Just saw pearl islands recently her game here adds point to that win too
2057,2020-06-29 05:00:36,hhsu5s,Wasn’t Parv going home early if not for Russel’s idol? The second point seems less impressive if that’s the case.
2058,2020-06-29 05:24:23,hhsu5s,That makes sense thanks.
2059,2020-06-29 05:04:18,hhsu5s,"Here is a great secret scene of hers that shows how perceptive Sandra is about what other players are doing:
https://youtu.be/BiqFyY6e5l4

There's also a great one that shows her jury management skills where she explains she isn't sure if she should play her idol because she doesn't want Danielle to think she could have saved her and lose her vote. I can't find that one though."
2060,2020-06-29 05:07:50,hhsu5s,Weren't they targeting Russell in that vote which is why Tyson switched to Parv to make sure she goes home?
2061,2020-06-29 05:18:46,hhsu5s,"They didn’t care who went home except Tyson who wanted parv 100%). Russel was probably the preferred target because of Rob, but I’m sure they wouldn’t have lost sleep if Russel played the idol for himself. This is probably what was expected to happen."
2062,2020-06-29 01:28:38,hhmmt1,Benjamin Wadsworth and Maria Gabriela de Faria... I’m guessing you watched Deadly Class?
2063,2020-06-29 01:30:51,hhmmt1,You would be correct. Pissed that it didn’t get a second season and Netflix passed on buying it. Highly recommend the graphic novels though.
2064,2020-06-29 01:37:28,hhmmt1,"ugh ikr? they casted such talented actors and to have it end after one season is a shame. the graphic novels are amazing tho, I’m glad that’s still continuing"

Back in the days when Grey's Anatomy started I watched it as a guilty pleasure and not a single time I really thought about the races of the cast-members which was very 'diverse'. I only thought Sandra Oh had a head like an egg with a painted-on face and someone slapped a wig on it - and it had nothing to do with her being asian but just her being plain ugly in my opinion. But it seems the insides of her head and an egg are not so different after all.


Its so ridiculous how it's all about races now. How there are the right and the wrong races in the name of 'antiracism'. How that people went from equality no matter the color of your skin to 'HuR dUr need more of MAW people' is beyond me."

How awkward it was that it was so white. I was completely dumbfounded. They actively complained the city was too white. It was just odd. I don't understand why ideological tick this is triggering.

It's like I've read things about American's complaining about how white Australia is, ignoring we're highly multicultural, they don't see the Asians, just the low numbers of black people. It's all strange."

Worse, doing nothing if not *actively promoting* ""whitey bad, all bad things whitney's fault"" as essentially the state church in these places.  And now after poking at the ""white supremacist"" boogeyman for years, leftists are seeing the inevitable backlash of making everything about race.

I used to worry what would happen if they kept up the ""individuals don't exist, only the racial collective is real"" mentality, and the ""...but all white people are equally subhuman and evil"" part was ignored.

Of course, people will attach a racial connotation to that, but I find Korean women very attractive.

2201,2020-08-15 15:13:34,ia3w3a,"as long as the writers actually give her substantial parts going forward :/ it's like the kept her off to the side in the last season, we didn't even really get any reaction to what she did at the end of season 2"
2202,2020-08-15 22:28:22,ia3w3a,yeah but the writers room is 100% white and that needs to change

2212,2020-08-16 10:47:38,ia3w3a,"yeah 100% its like my fav show and s3 was dissapointing even if i enjoyed it anyways, it just didnt have the same edge. i guess thats what we get for having a different writer every season, turned it into a different show this season. i guess the main focus was on what needs to happen for them to have that scene at the end and they developed V's character to fit that but forgot about Eve and now  she went from being so angry at her to the scene at the end with zero development"

Just watched her in Doctor Who and couldn't unsee the Crowleyness in her."
2218,2020-08-13 02:05:37,i8qan9,I would LOVE to see an Olivia Coleman/Catherine Tate adaptation!
2219,2020-08-24 02:20:12,i8qan9,Tilda Swinton as Crowley.
2220,2020-08-13 13:54:06,i8qan9,"Good point! I can see her sauntering, and would love to watch her portray the softer sides of Crowley. Given she always looks quite severe, I bet seeing her be soft would be the pinnacle to the “mean and scary but soft for (1) cinnamon roll angel” trope."

2222,2020-08-26 14:53:17,i8qan9,"I feel they’d do really well, especially with the switch roles part!"
2223,2020-08-26 14:58:08,i8qan9,"While she has played an angel, in the movie Constantine (?) I think, she actually seems *too* ethereal to me to play a very human inclined Crowley. She fits in more with the angels in Neil Gaiman’s Sandman series."
2224,2020-08-17 18:26:32,i8qan9,"Just her vibe in Green wing is enough to convince me, but her role in Sabrina really nails it."
2225,2020-08-12 06:29:52,i84rjv,"Bisexual half-Asian here and I agree with you so much! Sandra Oh is a treasure. I read that when she first skimmed the script, she didn’t realize she was a main character, because she’d been typecast as the Asian best friend for so long.
  
I also appreciate that Carolyn’s role could have easily been a grizzled old-school male leader, but they took all those tropes and applied them to a woman: never surprised at anything, one step ahead of the enemy, somewhat eccentric, etc. 
  
Also, I’ve noticed the “characters’ sexuality is not a big deal” is an element in phoebe waller-bridge’s other shows. So definitely check out Fleabag and Run for some queer happiness!"
2226,2020-08-12 08:11:39,i84rjv,"I have watched all 3 seasons front to back and back again. I can't get enough of the show!

It's so refreshing to see female actor as the main characters instead of something ""additional""to the show. I love all the characters in the show and that include Dasha who allegedly has halitosis...lol. The only one I dislike and in my opinion should have been killed without a doubt is the American guy with a big gut on the golf course in Scotland. dang! talk about stereotype!

Anyways, I cannot wait for 4th season and hopefully Villanelle and Eve will have more scenes together. maybe they will be off working for MI6 to take down the Twelve?"
2227,2020-08-12 09:51:33,i84rjv,"As a bisexual asian as well, yes, good for eve. 

I know we like to complain so much about the show, but at the end of the day, though we are the harshest critics, we are also tremendously grateful for the show. 

I watched the first season of a popular show - also central around women - few days ago. And you dont know how grateful i am of killing eve lmaoo. It made me think for a second that women are the only thing that matter in the world and anyone who speaks against them shall fall (or murdered). Its like KE is an alternative universe where being queer and a woman are not a political issue at all. 

Then i watch other shows and i am brought back to reality."
2228,2020-08-14 20:12:22,i84rjv,"It has often been said that none of us can imagine anyone else playing Villanelle other than Jodie Comer. In my humble opinion the exact same statement applies to Sandra Oh and Eve.

If we take just a moment to reflect on all the epic scenes she's delivered across all three seasons then I can with great certainty say that Killing Eve just wouldn't be the same without Sandra Oh. Who else could cut her lip and make it look dark, yet alluring at the same time? Her druken goodbye to Carolyn. Holding that teddy bear's heart to her ear. The intense struggle written all over her face as she's thinking should she or shouldn't she push that fellow in front of the train. 

Sandra Oh is a tremendously talented actress and she richly deserves all the praise and adoration she gets from the fans and the industry."
2229,2020-08-12 15:12:31,i84rjv,Well Phoebe Waller Bridge did write an amazing character. Honestly you will be disappointed for season 2 and 3 as eve's character arc has just reduced to nothing. I hope they are saving Eves story for season 4. I mean Sandra is EP on the show and assume she may have some say in the way it is headed. Both the seasons focused on V and Carolyn.
2230,2020-08-12 13:42:21,i84rjv,"Yes! I recently watched a clip on Facebook that said Sandra Oh thought her career was over (and her agent said so too) because there were so little roles for Asians. So thankful that she didn’t give up and she’s gifted us with her talent once more! 

And I totally agree with your statement on Carolyn. All the male characters seem to be secondary to the female ones; Konstantin may be the only one to be consistently present. This is very much a matriarchal show."
2231,2020-08-12 17:27:20,i84rjv,"> when she first skimmed the script, she didn’t realize she was a main character, because she’d been typecast as the Asian best friend for so long.

ugh, that's so disappointing to hear yet unfortunately understandable because Hollywood needs to get it the fuck together. I truly *can't imagine* what this show would be like without Sandra Oh."
2232,2020-08-12 13:45:49,i84rjv,"Shows like KE is spearheading the change of our reality. Soon, we’ll be free in our world as well."
2233,2020-08-14 23:10:49,i84rjv,Hell yes!
2234,2020-08-12 15:17:40,i84rjv,"I think that’s fine to focus on the other characters. It’s not my concern to have Eve/Sandra Oh get constant center stage, and I think that the narrative shifting goes well with the fact that Eve is a pawn in this huge game that consists of many players. If she ever does get focus on her arc again I would hope (idealistically speaking) that it’s with Villanelle and that it would be about them taking control of the game over the Twelve. But at this point, who knows! There’s a lot of characters and they’re strong women and that’s exciting!"

2. You vote Biden and Trump wins, this is only slightly less bad because you are no longer complicit.
3. You vote Trump and Biden wins, Better for our country better for you even though you're too ignorant to understand.
4. You vote Biden and Biden wins: Best outcome, you've helped our country recover from the mistake that is Trump and you've shown the Democrats that progressives can compromise enough to get things done in Washington slightly increasing progressive influence in the dnc.
5. You waste your vote on third party and Trump wins:  You get to brag about how principled you are and the country suffers.  Also by a one vote increment you tell the Democrats that progressives are not interested in actual politics and are just going to go home to mommy if they cant get what they want.  The third party you voted for is still irrelevant and always will be.
6. You waste your vote on third party and Biden wins:  You get to brag about how principled you are and again you will have moved the needle by one vote in favor of moderate policy inside the Democratic party.  The third party you voted for is still irrelevant and always will be."

He was VP of an administration that setup the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It’s without a doubt that he would appoint judges that would protect abortion rights. With respect to cannabis, he supports decriminalization, rescheduling, medical, and states’ freedom pursue legalization. I won’t keep going, but on almost every substantive issue you’ve listed, he’s not only the best choice of the two running, but holds a position that would significantly advance the issues in the directions you say you prefer."

What exactly would it take to change your mind?"
2262,2020-08-11 16:11:03,i7u6kh,"There's way too much here to go through and most of it seems exaggerated, taken out of context, old opinions, or pales in comparison to the same from Trump and sometimes all of the above. So I'll go with the easy one.

>opposed to healthcare reform

He *wants* a real public option, which if he manages to do, would be by far the greatest healthcare reform in the history of the country. How is that not healthcare reform?

The only possible explanation I can think of, and thats with giving you a charitable view, is that you are remembering him saying that he would veto a full on universal healthcare bill with no private insurance and practically 100% subsidized. But he explained its because he doesn't see how the country could pay for it and even said that he would sign it if someone could make the numbers make sense. So even then, he supports reform, but wants a concrete plan and isn't willing to play fast and loose with paying for it.

Basically, he's still a better candidate than Trump. He can still be influenced towards better policies than Trump. Lesser of two evils and all of that. So its not about him being an amazing candidate. Not sure you can get a significant amount of people to every say that about anybody where huge denial and partisan bias doesn't come into play."
2263,2020-08-11 16:46:55,i7u6kh,"First, we can’t look at Joe in a vacuum. We have to look at him compared to the other candidate and they are both problematic. Joe has a lot more experience in government which can be a help but it also can be a hindrance. Joe is very up there in years as can be seen when he is in an interview. He really seems to struggle with cognition. I think Trump has fewer issues holding a thought but he also has his sanity problems.  Sadly, they were both damaged goods and certainly not the best of that America has to offer. Also sadly, sometimes a nation gets the leaders it deserves. This may be the case with these two idiots"

Lol This post only exists because it’s relevant to this election year when people are going to have to vote and thus compare Trump to Biden. You’re just stonewalling. It doesn’t sound like you came here for a conversation or to have your view changed.
2269,2020-08-11 16:23:08,i7u6kh,"> I'm not talking about trump vs biden, just biden himself being terrible.

Well you did say that Biden was the ""worst candidate in history"", which does include Trump. And let's face it, you could have replaced all mentions of Joe Biden with Donald Trump and unless anyone followed the links that you provided it would still look like a plausible complaint. Nepotism? Incoherent babbling? Bullying? Yep - it all fits.

If you think of Joe Biden as someone that even Republicans would vote for, then it might be worth it just to get rid of the president who allowed nearly one quarter of the world's Coronavirus deaths to occur on his watch and to allow the economy to collapse to record levels. In that respect, by being the most electable he is not the worst candidate.

I would have preferred Bernie Sanders to be the candidate, but he may have been scary enough for the moderate Democrats and Republicans that they may have gone with Donald Trump as the devil that they know."

Likewise it's possible for a person to get a too solid grab on another, and instead of trying to get them off it's wise to attack them, make them quit due to pain, risk of taking more damage or too much damage.

Would be much harder to blind or suffocate a leech. Perhaps attack it with salt or dry it up but this environment prevented that from being accomplished fast. Few scouts can start a fire where everything's moist in 30 seconds while exhausted. Hitting it with a rock would've worked even if it'd feel awkward.

2341,2020-08-02 13:50:28,i2ad0t,"This one's a really strange year. It's not good, though the worst this year aren't bad either. Very standard the whole way through. Because of that it's really difficult to have a concrete ranking because of how similarly I view all the songs. My 7th place to 16th place have very little separating them.

My least favourite is the Netherlands 🇳🇱. It feels pretty cheap and I just can't get myself to really like it at all.

Ireland 🇮🇪 isn't a lot better. I kind of hate that thin songs like this can do as well as 4th seemingly just because they're in English.

France 🇫🇷 has a kind of appeal. It's got a very sort of classic melody which appeals to me but the whole presentation is really strange.

There's something I really like about Austria 🇦🇹. There's also something I really hate about it. Her voice is kind of annoying, but the song is really interesting in structure.

Portugal 🇵🇹 is pretty simple, fun, bland, inoffensive. I like it.

Israel 🇮🇱 sent their classic style again, but this one is much worse. I still like it, but it's much more amateurish.

Luxembourg 🇱🇺 is kind of nice. It's a sweet song and I see how it came 3rd. It's nearly good enough to be my 3rd place aswell, but since it's just that bit worse, 14th it is.

Germany 🇩🇪 is pretty nice aswell. It has a quite empowering melody and it has a cool arrangement. It's good.

Denmark 🇩🇰 is very Danish. The same song as in -84 and -85, just a little worse. This feels not as genuine and more fake than the others.

Belgium 🇧🇪 is an alright winner. It's a good song, I don't mind her voice at all. It could have been better, but I'm fine that Belgium managed to win with this song.

The United Kingdom 🇬🇧 is very standard for the UK in the 80s. Good again, there's something really cool about this.

There's something I love about Finland 🇫🇮. I love his voice, which really makes me like the ballad behind it.

Spain 🇪🇸 is so 80s, which fools me into thinking it's Spanish aswell. I love the style in this song! Overall a great package.

Cyprus 🇨🇾 is awesome and shouldn't have ended last! Such a catchy melody and she's a really charismatic performer.

Another incredible intro! This time from Iceland 🇮🇸. The rest of the song is really fun aswell. I love this debut entry, especially in the context of this year.

Norway 🇳🇴 had a great host entry aswell. It's taken a while to really grow on me, but it has. There's something so lovely about this.

Sweden 🇸🇪 is awesome! Everything about this performance is so ridiculous! They set up the singers, and the backing singers is the weird outfits, then they act all crazy with each other. Suddenly the bridge comes and this 6th guy with the guitar appears out of nowhere and everyone surrounds him and goes insane. Then they go to a piano as Lasse starts to 'play'. He gets up from the piano just as you can clearly hear the piano in the arrangement get louder. Suddenly, the entire orchestra outs down their instruments and starts clapping. It's so weird I love it.

Switzerland 🇨🇭 is a really great song in all regards. She's not the best singer, but she's good enough. The song has really cool verses and great choruses. I think I can forgive a pre-Celine song for being very Celine Dion.

Yugoslavia (with no emoji but with a song in Croatian) 🇭🇷 is gorgeous! It feels so Mediterranean, I love the guitar bit after the first chorus. I really love the piano aswell. It's so sweet.

My favourite of the year is Turkey 🇹🇷. This is such an intriguing song. The melodies are fantastic and I love the way it's staged. The trumpet in the 2nd verse is amazing aswell.

1987 is quite a bit better, though still not amazing."

But then she also wants a lifelong love-story, she wants to find the one love of her life. How does she think it happens ? That a Prince Charming will drop on her lap from the sky ? Also, she makes a lot of demands but doesn't want to put any effort herself. That's not how I view relationships personally.


Finally, after all those digressions on lyrics, here's a plain boring song. **Norway** has interesting costumes, but that's it. And them saying Rumeo is unsettling


The **Netherlands**, sorry u/Chiarin. It just goes nowhere.


The **UK** has an interesting backing music I feel. It could be a theme song in an 80s cop show. But the singing is not at all enticing.


I've gained a newfound appreciation for **Iceland** by watching late 80s early 90s contests. But their first entry doesn't do it for me. It has an intriguing title and the choreography is... wacky in a cute amateurish kind of way. But this song deserves a lot more energy from the singers.


I can surely understand that **Portugal** has a good singer, but I don't like the way she sings.


What is it with Scandinavians and 2 pirouetting backing dancers each time ? Now it's **Denmark** doing it. They're trying to be uptempo, but the singer's voice and the little chimes are too cute for me to get dragged along in the fun times.


**Luxembourg** has one of the most basic chanson I've ever heard. Which should be enough for me to like it, but I don't like the repetition of ""Sans raison"" and the singer does have an English accent. This is kinda out of place in a song that quintessentially French.


For **Austria**, I spent the whole song thinking : ""Please, make it more dramatic"" and then she did it. And it didn't sound good, she wasn't capable of it. Lesson learned, sometimes a song without drama is better. At least I like the verses.


Doris Dragovic singing for **Yougoslavia** ! Here's a name I recognise. She's going to come back stronger in 1999. I like the drama here, and the drums. But the backing singers aren't up to the task. I like the sharp rising words she sings sometimes.


**Ireland** here with a very 80s sounding song. I like the repeating synthetiser in the background, and the verses have a peculiar rhythm. The chorus is a bit underwhelming though.


I like **Turkey** ! The trumpet is half-adorable half-triumphant, and the longs notes they sing at the beginning of the bridge (or is it the chorus ? That song has a nebulous structure.) are the most memorable part for me. I wonder if I'll see the Halley Comet in my lifetime...


**Israel** has an awesome up-tempo track, but I feel the singers aren't following it. They are too calm ( as opposed to the dancers that are properly energetic !)


**Germany** gets totally carried by the singer here. She has a great voice ! The chorus in particular captivates me.


The chorus of **Spain** got caught in my head. The 80s intrumentation is also interesting here, and he does put passion in the verses ;) (Seriously, the way he says ""La passion"" cracks me up !)


**Belgium**'s only win so far, with Sandra Kim. She is famous in France for singing the opening of [Il était une fois... la Vie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNnpHAszq64). If anyone here liked the concept of Cells at Work ! then this is similar, but from 1986. She peaked early...

She does sing ""J'aime **LE** vie"" which ruins my enjoyement of the chorus, which should be the strongest part of the song. However, I like this song enough that this doesn't ruin the whole thing for me. But given how many times I've complained about lyrics here, I do understand you. Hearing her sing that she's 15 when I know she's 13 is also disturbing.


**Finland** is very emotionnal. This is a great power ballad and the guy is totally selling it. The ""oooooooouuuuuhhs"" from the backing singers add a nice layer to the music without being annoying.


**Cyprus** finished last... because ? This is the kind of song Israel normally sends, but here it's Cyprus. The chorus is very catchy.


Finally, the song that makes it worth it for me, **Sweden**. I love rock, I love people scream-singing at me and I adore confrontational male/female duos ! I love the performance from everyone on stage here, that's what I more of. Energy !


The running order here made me very scared that this year was somehow going to be even worse than 1985. And with 2 songs I should love but didn't for lyrical reasons, Sweden really saved the day here. The worst is behind us, Eurovision will have better songs from now on, for a little while."
2345,2020-08-02 18:25:50,i2ad0t,A crime that Sweden didn’t send Lena Philipsson with Kärleken är evig!
2346,2020-08-02 17:54:55,i2ad0t,"So the songs that i liked are Luxembourg, Switzerland, Belgium, Sweden and Denmark, any of those 5 winning would have been okay with me.  
Germany, Cyprus, UK and Turkey are alright, the rest are below average.  
The songs that i heavily disliked:  
Spain, god it feels so forced and cringy, like that Video Video song Denmark sent earlier. Not sure which one i hate more.  
Israel also kinda sucks hard, the song is bad and there is no good choreography or anything interesting to save it.  
The Netherlands also wasn't great but nowhere near as bad as the 2 mentioned above"
2347,2020-08-02 15:07:14,i2ad0t,This year is a case study in how advantageous singing in French/English was. Countries like Turkey or Finland kept fighting uphill battles.
2348,2020-08-02 18:21:52,i2ad0t,">Switzerland 🇨🇭 is a really great song in all regards. She's not the best singer, but she's good enough. The song has really cool verses and great choruses. I think I can forgive a pre-Celine song for being very Celine Dion.

I can't, but that's because I can't stand Celine Dion. We'll get to that in 1988. ;)"
2349,2020-08-02 18:33:00,i2ad0t,"Omg, that's awesome! I love the guy at the back with his two little hammers! Yeah, this would have got my vote."
2350,2020-08-02 12:00:48,i2ad0t,I know they tried to get the result overturned when it turned out that Sandra Kim was thirteen rather than fifteen. :p
2351,2020-08-02 18:29:11,i2ad0t,">She does sing ""J'aime LE vie"" which ruins my enjoyement of the chorus, which should be the strongest part of the song. However, I like this song enough that this doesn't ruin the whole thing for me. But given how many times I've complained about lyrics here, I do understand you. Hearing her sing that she's 15 when I know she's 13 is also disturbing.

The thing with me is that I tend to get far more passionate about things I hate than about things I love. Either that or there are far more things I hate than things I love. 

I once toyed with making a website where I would rank things by how much I hated them. It was kind of my husband's idea, after I once said something like 'I hate hate hate hate hate people who don't close their mouth when they chew'. Ever since then he tends to ask 'do you hate hate it, or do you just hate it?' 

(Take all this with a grain of salt by the way, before you think I'm nothing but a morose git complaining about everything. But I do still hate J'Aime la Vie.)"
2352,2020-08-02 18:57:46,i2ad0t,"The same Lena Philipsson that sang ""It hurts"" ? Whoa, she's older than I thought."
2353,2020-08-02 17:58:24,i2ad0t,"I will be honest, most of what Finland has sent was boring or just bad, and up to this point the only years they had been really overlooked are 1977 and 1983, maybe you can count Tipi tii and Playboy, but yeah most of them are bad. Turkey kinda similar, most of them while funky aren't good, but they did deserve to be at least middle of the pack and not dead last"
2354,2020-08-02 18:43:24,i2ad0t,"I remember a while ago someone asked about this song in this subreddit and I ended up writing about it and translating the lyrics. It's [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/aueqvp/what_is_the_best_national_final_song_that_didnt/eh7pw0k/), if you're interested."
2355,2020-08-02 12:59:55,i2ad0t,Yeah right. I had expected Daniella to win.
2356,2020-08-02 14:54:34,i2ad0t,"I don't know what Switzerland was expecting here, there is no limit on the singer's age (as we'll learn in 1989). I know that they tried it just in case it worked, and they might have felt slighted and owed a win. But still..."
2357,2020-08-02 18:56:51,i2ad0t,"Ever heard about the I Hate Everything Youtube Channel ? Also, I think I myself can be negative depending on the year (1984-5-6...). I'm going to thrash 70% of everything from 2000-2006, and then there'll always be songs I hate with a fiery passion. It's harder for me to be angry at older songs because there's a certain class to them and they're interesting to me (since I wasn't born). I'll hate more a shitty song from the 2010s than the 80s."
2358,2020-08-02 19:01:45,i2ad0t,"Yes! She sang entries in Melodifestivalen 1986 through 88, and wrote some other entries throughout the 90s before her triumphant return in 2004."
2359,2020-08-02 18:41:34,i2ad0t,"Which I'd say pretty much proves the point. Mediocre French- or English language songs just end much higher than mediocre Finnish, Turkish or Greek songs."
2360,2020-08-02 22:22:02,i2ad0t,"Glad I'm not the only one to hate things with a passion. How old are you, if I may ask?

As for 2000-2006, there was a period when I stopped watching Eurovision, and it may well have been around then. I lost interest because everything was so crap, so that would match that period..."
2361,2020-08-02 19:56:41,i2ad0t,"Yeah you can definitely see it with Ireland and UK, especially in the 90s"
2362,2020-08-01 22:47:55,i20ki1,Holy hecc this was long
2363,2020-08-02 05:56:41,i20ki1,I struggled with the last part and I didn’t know a few in the other sections. I didn’t keep track of my score but overall I probably got like an 86-90%
2364,2020-08-02 18:45:24,i20ki1,"The first question should say what is the name on the tv guide not the name of the tv guide. Also, Frank Jr isn't born. It's Frank Jr Jr."
2365,2020-08-02 21:01:57,i20ki1,Reddit formatting makes it very tedious to participe in the quizz. Have you thought of putting it in a quizz website? I’m sure there exist plenty

2371,2020-08-01 03:16:55,i1kgww,"Fun fact: Conservatives think the exact same about anyone with an Obama, Biden, Hillary, Beto etc. sticker."

2373,2020-08-01 04:37:55,i1kgww,"Yes because those politicians stickers are on lifted trucks with confederate flags trying to antagonize people... 

Fun Fact: The gang are not conservatives.. They actually make fun of people like you in the show and irl.

Now go back to calling people leftists and sucking trumps dick. Yes I looked at your post history, it's disgusting and I want to salt you like a snail."
2374,2020-08-01 04:43:50,i1kgww,"Haha ofc you went thru my post history, cuz evidently you’re a fucking psychopath. Enjoy 4 more years of Trump. 

Who ever said the gang are conservatives? They’re written to be horrible, narcissistic people so it’s only right they’d be leftists. 

Only Frank is a conservative. Hates Hillary Clinton and is Capitalist. Edit: Frank is also a big 2A guy. Always carrying his piece."

With that being said, I am no longer going to reply to your sad pathetic meaningless attempts at communication. Kind of like your life, bye Felicia

Like I said the show itself makes fun of people like you. You literally watch the show and coincide with the things they are making fun of.. What a fucking fruitcake"

I’ve also just recently watched the musical episode. I must admit I was skeptical but really enjoyed it. For me the best moments of this show are those where the acting and the music gives me goosebumps and that’s why I love it so much!

Eminem, who was reportedly “stressed” over what Carey might say about their rumored 2001 fling, doesn’t have to worry. “There’s some songs that I can sing in response to that, but I will not do it,” she’ll say when I ask. And then, with a roll of her head: “If somebody or something didn’t pertain to the actual meaning of Mariah Carey, as is the title, then they aren’t in the book.”""

I just died. Queen of shade. Mariah is giving us life ! I knew she wouldn't mention Eminem, despite all the stupid newspapers that kept claiming she was going to. She had much better and more important things to write about and I'm glad to see she felt the same way."

I hide inside during the brightest days of the year for sure.  It’s an unconscious thing, and I don’t lead the kind of up all night in the studio kind of life that would accept that kind of pattern, so it never became a thing like that with me.

But that really makes me curious."

2447,2020-09-01 23:00:38,ija8jt,"I'd like to make a couple of suggestions. The start over button is, especially as it's the top one on the ""think about your next move"" screen, way too easy to hit accidentally, especially on a touchscreen. It should probably be moved (to the bottom of that list, at least), and maybe an ""are you sure"" check could be added. Also, a couple of times, it felt like there should be options (such as when Brody >!demands a blowjob if you give him your key in the prologue!<, or when Teagan >!tells you about her fling with her older neighbor, and you get very hardline about one interpretation of some jurisdictions' age of consent laws!<), but the narrative just goes on. The second case is especially true since there's no way to avoid it, even by going back to the beginning and starting over."

2449,2020-08-31 09:51:04,ija8jt,"Oh, definitely me... Well, no, definitely me.

Ok, so here is the hesitation.

Of the first 50,000 words, she wrote about 20,000, but of the next 50,000 she wrote about 10,000, and of the last 100,000 she might have wrote 10,000.

Her quantity of words written lower and she is thinking of no longer writing for the site.

BUT

She focuses on the planning, so I don't have to. She plans scenes (which we call steps), she created chapters ( a group of steps), characters, she fills in a secret field for the steps telling me what the step should achieve, so that I don't have to think about it.

Well, I do, because taking a description and writing 500 to 1000 words takes more details, but I don't have to think about many details.

I started my first game, the international chastity game, 100% alone because I was bored from the COVID19 and frustrated at the lack of depth of most of the games here.

I only planned like 6 countries but my wife joined in and added more characters, more ideas, pushed me forward.

When we began to get stuck, we designed the college idea together.

But now, she has a new job in a grocery store and is a lot more exhausted after work."
2450,2020-09-01 00:02:12,ija8jt,"Oh shit... that is indeed a bug!

I will investigate"
2451,2020-09-01 00:37:43,ija8jt,"Hi,

I found the issue!!! Wow, that was a sneaky one.

So, early on, I discovered a big bug: if you refreshes a page, it would re-apply the flags.

For example, when you see Sandra, you need to see her a certain number of times to progress. For example, the 3 or 4th, she takes you to an abandoned shower and showers with you, and then, takes you again the next day.

To move, you need to visit the page with the text (reading it or not).

Time #3 is the first time, and #4 is the second time, with #5 doing something else, etc...

But if you refreshed the page, it would just increase the counter and you would miss events!

You could refresh the sleep page 10 times to skip 10 days!

So I added that it's only when a step is NEW that the actions are applied... which makes sense!

Except that...today, I fixed a bug and by mistake, put so that instead of nothing the interrupt as being seen (the new step) I note the previous step (whatever it was).

If you refreshed the interrupt, it would work, but if you didn't it would loop.

It is now fixed thanks your help! Thank you!"
2452,2020-09-01 23:24:42,ija8jt,"For the start over button, that is an excellent idea!

As for the options, these are good feedbacks but we got the opposite from many readers who wanted more control from the characters. 

For Brody, this was our first chapter and we learned a lost in the process. This is why we added the skip over the prologue. We will revisit it in the future.

As for Teagan, the age of consent thing becomes a recurring thing she constantly repeats, frustrated at you. Our patrons want her cruel with you and that is her motivation : she hates that you wanted her in jail.

But maybe it's not important... what choice would you like there? Your idea isn't bad at all..."
2453,2020-09-02 23:01:22,ija8jt,"> . The start over button is, especially as it's the top one on the ""think about your next move"" screen, way too easy to hit accidentally, especially on a touchscreen

So here is what I did:

1 ) Moved it at the bottom, under it's own title
2 ) When you click on it, you need to confirm you want to reset.

This should make it much harder to accidentally reset!

Thank you for the suggestion!"
2454,2020-08-31 17:50:01,ija8jt,It's cool that she is okay with it and even supports and helps you plan it out! I've always wondered if some ppl in relationships would have their significant other be jealous from all the pics of models here but i guess not lol. I hope you worship your wife when she's tired from work so she can relax! Good luck too both of you guys with your project and I hope things get a little easier financially.  Ik we are all just waiting for the day covid stops taking jobs from ppl
2455,2020-09-02 02:24:48,ija8jt,"I'm not sure what would be better for Teagan, given that intended character arc. My personal reaction to her story, *if* I were going to be judgemental about it, would be to judge her as the ""other woman"", but I'm not sure about that either. But the way it's written now seems even more batshit than I expect from the ditzy valley girl she gets described as - even if I call that rape, it's a long leap to say I'm saying the victim should be in jail. Honestly, it would be easy enough for the ditzy valley girl to be mean to people she dislikes (like Cordelia in season 1 of *Buffy*, for example) and then come up with a ditzy excuse for her to dislike Allan.

I get what you (and the patrons, which I'm not) are saying about more control from the other characters, but the game plays like limited sandbox, or reads like a choose your own adventure book, and reader agency, especially when you're trying to learn about the world and characters, is vital to that aim. Even Brody's ""let me masturbate"" feels like it's missing the option to either leave the room or try not to watch - which latter could offer the chance to learn a good deal about Brody.

If I were looking at this as a cyoa book, I would say that it felt like the book trying to force the reader to the desired end, rather than the characters trying to move the main character towards their own goals by using in-story consequences. For example, if you refuse to blow Brody, he could refuse to introduce Allan to the nicer dating options, or he might ""let slip"" the fact that he's in chastity, rather than letting him tell people in his own time."
2456,2020-09-02 23:02:30,ija8jt,Thank you. That should make accidental resets almost impossible. [*knocks wood*]

I know, it's random,  but this started  before covid19.  I don't want to bring politics into this, but damn, it's been rough these past 3 years in particular here.

Anyways, thank you!

If there is any perk that could convince you to support financially which we do not offer yet, would you care sharing it?

We got a bunch of amazing supporters in the first month and it is slowing down.

Asking them for ideas would be like preaching to the choir... so any gem you could share?"
2458,2020-09-02 10:04:47,ija8jt,"very, very good points!

We will work in that direction. Rework the prologue and such.

In future steps, Teagan is changing, so perhaps we can slightly rework the inital ones.

For the CYOA' you sre 100% right. We began with a ton og options and more and more, it's more like a linear process.

You pick which girl you want to play with and follow her narrative.

We've been seeing it for a while: Amanda for example, has 2 possible paths, and they both converge later into one.

The problem is the splitting.

Amanda has over 30,000 words more or less a single path. The alternate path is about 1000 words and you later get back to the 30,000 words.

But if we want trully different paths, it mean 2 trees of decisions, one for choice A, with perhaps 15,000 words and another with choice B, with it's own 15,000 words.

So I guess for now, we will build one path, but will need to think about adding more, and more sub-branches which add ""local"" differences but don't matter much the next day.

For now, appart from Teagan who is forced upon you, you choices are mainly whom to play with, not so much how the play goes.

I guess that we will need to adress that."

You are still stuck with her 3 times, but after that, you can turn her off."

Who both lucked out by virtue of the Yul/Wendel/Nick pregame alliance opting to target Tyson's group instead of theirs?

Rob was swapped screwed because the work he was doing to get out of the hole was completely halted just to give him worst case scenario. Rob's tribe seemed a lot more neurotic than Sandra's, as Danni was imploding and Adam was trying to be a puppetmaster. Compared to Bakal where the only guy honestly stirring up trouble was Tyson.

Ben being on the tribe at all is already a disaster as Rob automatically does not have majority.

EDIT: And just to make things clear, just because someone was from your tribe does not mean they count as a number for you after a swap. Adam literally just voted against Rob in the previous vote. They aren't together by any means."
2547,2020-08-25 22:18:59,iglb4l,"Ok now this is something that bothers me. I don't know how you can say that Boston Rob wasn't swap screwed. First off, just because you have a majority of your original tribe on your new tribe doesn't mean you are directly in the majority. We have to look at the people Rob was with, and he was stuck with the person who just tried to vote out his closest ally and who Rob tried to vote out, and a guy who hated him for whatever reason. How is it a good swap when you get stuck with the two people who trust you the least. Second, you say that Rob didn't prepare for the swap, which is not true at all. Rob had good relationships with a lot of people on original Sele. The only person who hated him was Ben, which Rob knew. This is why Rob tried to vote Ben out at the Ethan vote, which would have happened had Adam not gotten greedy and tried to keep all his relationships. Rob had complete awareness about his relationships with other and he did try to make sure he had good relationships for the swap. It is just Adam messed everything up."
2548,2020-08-25 23:07:38,iglb4l,"He was not swap screwed because he was in the majority. His inability to get along with Ben is what caused his demise.

That being said, he did get unlucky, as he probably could have worked with any person on his original tribe other than Ben."

2550,2020-08-26 03:53:35,iglb4l,"Ben told Jeremy Day 1 that they should have a F4 with Tony and Sarah (police/military/fire department). This combined with how close Ben was with those 2 and Sarah's history with pregaming makes me strongly believe there was an alliance. Additionally, Ben had it out for Rob from the beginning in pregame interviews he wanted Rob out first, and he was with Danni at the beginning scheming to weaken Rob because he had a statue and was a 4timer. All Rob did was ask Ben a question to take the target off his back and Ben was ""alienated"" since. Ben was never working with Rob and was always working with Sarah so this was def. a swapscrew. 

As for Adam, him and Rob did want to work with each other but Adam flipped because Ben was going to anyway. Rob also knew this (he's said multiple times he knew he was screwed, FWIW Adam has come out and Rob was DOA as well), which is why he tried the buddy system last second, to prevent Adam and Ben from getting a chance to strategize (keep in mind if this actually worked Sarah plays the Advantage anyway so it's still a screw like you said).

Rob was def. swapscrewed (probably the 2nd highest behind Parv who literally ended up on a tribe of 5 with a pregame alliance of 4 lmao), and his WaW game is pretty solid in my book considering this dude had the biggest fucking target of all time."

While he was working to get out of the hole he dug himself into previously, his lack of skill at unifying people/ playing from the bottom really showed on yara. It showed how his winning cast was so lacking in strategy that the buddy system worked. The issue with his strategy is that it wasn’t in Adams best interest to vote rob out and yet Adam still did it because robs strategy was so poor. If you read Adams ama he goes in depth on this. Adam knee he or Ben would be on the bottom of Sophie/Sarah and if the sele boys put their differences aside they could have gained control of that tribe helping all three of them. Rob wasn’t swap screwed, because being swap screwed means that there is nothing you can possibly do to save yourself. In this situation rob has options to at least try to save himself, but he misread his tribe members giving him no chance to scramble."
2556,2020-08-25 21:41:06,iglb4l,"Think you’re missing the point. 

1. They didn’t “luck” into having the other group targeted. Amber had no chance, Tyson on the other hand, was not supposed to be the next target, Tony was (per RHAP)

2. The point of the post is that not getting along with a member of your OG tribe and having it come back to bite you in a swap isn’t getting screwed. It is *possible* for most, if not all of your OG tribe members to want to work with you. Not having divisive votes is part of preswap strategy. There were not many people in his OG tribe that Rob could’ve been swapped into a majority with where it would’ve worked out."
2557,2020-08-25 23:16:26,iglb4l,Completely agree. He did not have the majority. I’m just saying he *could’ve* if he got along with more of his original tribe 🤷‍♀️

Lemme guess. Claims from Danni, right? I'm sure her saying old school alliance to Ben and Ethan was just editing being ""wonky""."
2562,2020-08-25 21:54:04,iglb4l,"Regarding the luck bit. Tyson caused himself to be targeted. Obviously Sandra and Sarah didn't make a mistake, but Tyson overplaying is ""lucky"" in the sense that the target was removed without them having to do much.

But my issue is your definition of swap screwed. You say if you swap with a ""majority"", you can't be swap screwed without advantages being in play. But Rob didn't swap with a majority. His TRIBE had majority, but not his ALLIANCE, which is what you should be going by. 

Rob was targeted by virtue of his alliance being targeted. It sure is nice to claim he should have focused on building relationships and all, but he really couldn't do that because... well... he was targeted! However, he successfully navigates his way out of the bottom (seemingly), and is on his way to at least be ahead of two people on his tribe. Yul, for example, can also be said to be swap screwed. Because now he will always be the second person voted off of his tribe no matter what he pitches. Despite being much higher on the pecking order on his original tribe.

Rob, despite working to put himself higher on the totem pole, was swapped in a situation where he would always be first voted off. If he had Parvati, Jeremy, or even Michele, he could work with something. Heck, even if Sophie and Sarah were swapped out with Tony and Sophie. Suddenly Rob has much more wiggle room by virtue of what other players value. Sarah and Sophie had nothing to gain by keeping Rob. It was literally worst case scenario."
2563,2020-08-25 23:40:09,iglb4l,"But Rob literally did get along with everyone on his tribe except for Ben, who hated Rob for whatever reason. Rob also said on Michele's Whine Wednesday that he originally wanted to work with Ben. I just think Ben had it out for Rob from the get go. Remember ,Nick and Jeremy also said that Ben was hard to work with and was very stubborn on who he wanted to work with. I just think Rob shouldn't be faulted for his relationship with Ben when all evidence point to Ben causing the rift between him and Rob. Also, as I said earlier, Rob recognized that Ben didn't like him, and would have gotten rid of him at the Ethan vote if Adam didn't intervene."

2567,2020-08-25 22:10:36,iglb4l,"From Ethan’s ama “there was a perceived old school alliance. That did not exist. Rob, parv, and I had an alliance, but danni was not a part of that. But when she mentioned it to Ben...then it looked like we did...and we didn’t.”

From Adams ama “Danni did not out the old schoolers in any meaningful way. They made it obvious they were together by all going down to the beach together just them one morning. When everyone else woke up it was an easy “us vs. then” that formed. The other old schoolers (and everyone, really) targeted Danni as an easy vote that everyone could get behind BEFORE Danni started to target parv or let things slip or whatever. By that point she was in desperation mode and had already been targeted.” 

Danni and other have also mentioned it, but this was just on the first two amas I looked at."
2568,2020-08-25 22:58:23,iglb4l,"Claims from Danni, Ethan, Adam AND Jeremy. The old schoolers turned on her because they knew they were being seen as an alliance and hoped that by voting Danni out they could throw the others off the scent. Danni never went after them until she found out that they had been running her name through the tribe non-stop."
2569,2020-08-25 23:08:52,iglb4l,"Multiple people have said the Danni boot was highly inaccurate in the edit, and she didn’t self implode 

Danni was barely even part of the old school alliance it seems"
2570,2020-08-25 22:05:21,iglb4l,"I think we agree on the details but not the conclusion. I think that in modern survivor, where you can expect a swap, you can’t divide the OG into such obvious, divisive, alliances. Because, with a swap coming you might need them.

This strategy also played a role in the “luck” you were talking about earlier. Yul and company had the numbers to knock out Tony without the GC group. But they took into account the value of having a consensus vote before a swap. 

I don’t disagree that Rob was in a different, messier situation before the swap than somebody like Sandra. But I’m saying that was influenced by *strategy*, not luck. 

But this strategy is important on both sides, the majority and the minority when there is an early divisive votes."
2571,2020-08-26 02:48:34,iglb4l,Yeah I believe it is on Michele's IG TV. There is an Amber cameo in there as well.
2572,2020-08-25 23:41:19,iglb4l,What did you think the above was? 😂
2573,2020-08-25 22:20:59,iglb4l,"Ethan's argument has always been... odd. It was an old school alliance by virtue of all the alliance members being old school. Like, the ""All female alliance"" still voted out females. It's just that every member has a shared trait.

However Danni's failure to realize her phrasing makes Ethan seem less trustworthy to Ben, and by extension, harder for her to gain traction, is on her."
2574,2020-08-25 22:16:49,iglb4l,"It's strange, because imo, for Adam, it made more sense to stick with Robs' group specifically because of what you're saying. Natalie was already voted off, so finishing off Michele and Jeremy would have given Adam more saftey until a swap, and given him the same options of flipping or not. But wheras Rob was placed with four people unlikely to work with him, the fact that the very same can easily happen to Adam but didn't (If he was swapped with Rob and Parvati, for example) is what makes me not like blaming Rob for his lack of effort.

In all honestly, Rob was completely on defense for a large portion of his game. Yul had control, but Rob didn't. One can claim Rob should have played more passively like Kim did, but we also have to acknowledge the collective threat of Rob+Parvati would not allow that. 

I see your stance, but I would have to respectively disagree. Though I am much more lenient on claiming people are swap screwed. Specifically when it's two tribes to three. It was to the point that once the tribes swapped, I immediately knew Parvati, Rob, and Sandra/Tony would be the first boots of each tribe. The less tribemates leads to very little wriggle room and increased odds that you'd be SOL if your tribe wasn't unanimously voting people off before the swap."
2575,2020-08-26 16:01:03,iglb4l,"Thanks! I did see, and love, the amber clip"
2576,2020-08-25 22:23:03,iglb4l,Will you explain your second statement? If her phrasing makes ethan seem less trustworthy isn’t that good for her game since she was being targeted by both sides. Shouldn’t she try and make someone seem less trustworthy.
2577,2020-08-25 22:58:50,iglb4l,Because you know more than the people who actually went out there and played the game???
2578,2020-08-25 23:10:32,iglb4l,"I do think that Adam would’ve been better off taking out Jeremy if possible. Jeremy’s whole thing is meat shields, Adam was never in his long term plans. 

But I hope I’m not being misunderstood by saying that I think Boston Rob screwed up his game and lost the game. He never had a chance. He lost the game on Day 0, similarly to Parv. All I’m saying is, though both Rob and Parv’s boots were inevitable in the long run, Parv was swap screwed when Rob was not. And I’m all good agree to disagree on that, just want to make sure it’s clear that I’m aware of what Rob’s circumstances were coming into the game. 🙂"
2579,2020-08-26 17:05:03,iglb4l,"Yeah, I wish we could see more of Amber. I wish she would have her own social media, but I guess Rob is just the ambassador of that family."
2580,2020-08-25 22:30:03,iglb4l,"Well, it seems like Danni didn't do an amazing job at building connections (though her being so disconnected from everyone doesn't help).

I would think her best option is aligning WITH Rob's group because Natalie was already voted out. It would be much easier to make a case that Jeremy and Michele should go next. But for reason, Danni didn't trust them. But making Ben distrust Ethan is nice and all. But it didn't help that people wanted an easy vote. And the only person without a connection needed to pick a side ASAP."
2581,2020-08-25 22:54:01,iglb4l,"While yes it would be nice if she could trust the old schoolers, but even if she did it would only be 4-5. Her best bet was sowing distrust between parv/rob/ethan and hoping the new schoolers would vote with her to take out parv. That couldn’t really happen tho because a lot of new schoolers (Denise, Michele, Jeremy) wanted you use parv and rob as meat shields. Danni wasn’t a big enough name to be a lion, and she didn’t have enough connections to new school players. Maybe if she went in playing slightly different things could be different, but I doubt that, because her threat level seemed to hurt her more than help her"

2583,2020-08-23 17:52:46,if0xh5,Seasons 15 and 16 are atrocious.
2584,2020-08-23 18:49:49,if0xh5,"My quality perception goes like this: seasons 1-3 awesome, 4-8 excellent, 9-11 good, 12- onwards regular. I still enjoy it though."
2585,2020-08-24 01:16:16,if0xh5,"Agree with all this. I personally further divide it into 1-3 (exceptional seasons, great writing, storytelling and characterizations, the show could have ended here and still been a beloved classic), 4-8 (great seasons, though 5 had very iffy plot lines and was easily the worst of this batch) and 9-10 (noticeable dip in quality but still overall good cohesive stories). As you noted 11 and 12 are a further dip from 9 and 10; both of them have a few really quality episodes, and they both start quite strong but just completely lose steam toward the end of the season. 13 onward is such a dip in quality that it’s actually shocking. 13 in particular is unwatchable. The characters actions don’t make sense and the writers just seemed to have completely forgotten how to make an entertaining show, much less a good one. 14 through 16 is an improvement but still, it’s a completely different show in terms of quality at this point."
2586,2020-08-23 17:58:43,if0xh5,"Honestly yes. The acting in some of the later seasons didn't flow at all and scenes felt so awkward. Like season 14 was so jam packed with stories but all of them were rushed. 

I remember how they finished the Harper Avery allegations and Paul Stradler in a few episodes when those stories could have been so powerful."
2587,2020-08-23 15:13:50,if0xh5,exactly!!
2588,2020-08-23 17:56:53,if0xh5,"If seasons 15 and 16 were considered as a separate show, there is no way that the show would get renewed. It's literally free-riding off of the success of earlier seasons whilst simultaneously ruining the show's legacy. I don't get people who are excited about season 17..."
2589,2020-08-24 10:08:28,if0xh5,Agreed! seasons 11-12 was definitely a transition period for the worst from season 13 and onwards
2590,2020-08-23 18:04:58,if0xh5,">season 14 was so jam packed with stories but all of them were rushed. 

I think that's the main problem with Krista's writing style. We've seen that she's capable of writing successful, smaller, one-episode projects such as 'Into You Like a Train', but she evidently struggles with seeing storylines out to the end as she tends to focus her main attention on one storyline; quickly rushing others, that she doesn't like, to do so. Even if it makes no sense and the viewers aren't down with it."
2591,2020-08-23 18:00:55,if0xh5,Me either!! I am not excited for the new season at all. I watched seasons 13 and 14 for Capshaw and Drew...when they were let go I was basically done with the show. I watched the next two seasons just because but I honestly struggled through the episodes.
2592,2020-08-23 18:14:34,if0xh5,"I don't get how people can watch the whole show in less than a month when there is a visible decline in quality. It took me more than 2 months to watch season 13 alone, like I need a break to recover from the atriociousness 😂 It makes no logical sense to me that Drew and Capshaw were fired when their characters had just as much story to tell as anyone else on the show and they're still fan-favourites. The fact that Jackson is still on the show, whose storylines have been, for the majority, shared with and mirrored by April's, is in itself a contradiction of Krista's ""creative decisions""."
2593,2020-08-23 19:09:06,if0xh5,"I don’t understand how Owen is still on the show! He just got extended for three more years....all he does is marry people and impregnate them. what else can they do with him?!  
Capshaw and Drew will always be fan favorites... they are great onscreen. I still hold out hope for a spin off with Herman, Arizona, Callie and throw in Addison in NYC running a women’s clinic. That would be so awesome and would be a huge draw for fans. I think it would blow Greys out of the water."
2594,2020-08-24 10:11:33,if0xh5,"Definitely, what is the point of Owen's presence on the show other than his failed marriages and adamant need for children? He hasn't had a personal storyline since the PTSD one in seasons 5/6. If the decision was based on relevance season 14-wise, he should've been the one to go, not April or Arizona. I still hold out hope for a last minute endgame for Japril, like the Izzex one 😂"
2595,2020-08-24 10:31:01,if0xh5,Yes! He came Onto Greys around when Arizona did and he is still on there! He should be gone lol. I can’t believe he has been on there that long and accomplished nothing but gets a contract extension. 😳🙄
2596,2020-08-24 10:35:00,if0xh5,"It's either because Kevin Mckidd is also a director for the show or because Krista has an obsessive need to complete storylines that were relevant when she was still on the show, from like 9 years ago 🙄 e.g. Towen."

However, now that Jodie is almost done with the last duel, Sandra is going to get engaged in this one (God knows for how long!). It means Killing Eve is gonna get more delayed.. and maybe by the time Sandra is done with this, Jodie will get busy somewhere else! 

Just thinking this makes me kinda sad 😥 😞"
2601,2020-10-08 17:46:18,j7fk55,Nice. I look forward to seeing Sandra Oh in a horror movie.
2602,2020-10-08 19:04:46,j7fk55,I'm hoping it'll only take Sandra a few months to film this one and then they can film KE in Jan?
2603,2020-10-08 19:08:22,j7fk55,Hope so! Fingers crossed 🤞
2604,2020-10-08 15:49:59,j7bmym,Oh cool
2605,2020-10-08 20:21:07,j7bmym,"Is it just me, or does Sam Raimi look like he’s turning into Bill Murray?"
2606,2020-10-08 16:52:55,j7bmym,Coooool. She's a wonderful actress.
2607,2020-10-08 16:31:34,j7bmym,Do you think it is pronounced Um Ah or Oom Ah?
2608,2020-10-08 17:34:57,j7bmym,Always glad to see Joxer the Mighty still getting work.
2609,2020-10-08 22:13:56,j7bmym,"Fuck producing, get back behind the camera Sam!!"
2610,2020-10-08 18:13:46,j7bmym,This is going to be a good movie I predict.
2611,2020-10-08 20:55:33,j7bmym,In my language umma means breastfeed.  Or more specifically the act of breastfeeding a child.
2612,2020-10-08 19:27:27,j7bmym,Awesome ..... she’s creepy AF
2613,2020-10-08 21:09:24,j7bmym,This is exciting.

2618,2020-10-08 21:02:39,j7bmym,Oh cool
2619,2020-10-08 20:31:30,j7bmym,Sort of what I thought. I was like... why does he look so familiar in a not Sam Raimi kinda way?
2620,2020-10-08 16:37:03,j7bmym,Closer to Um Mah. It's Korean for mother.
2621,2020-10-08 16:39:23,j7bmym,"It’s Korean for mom, and the first bit is pronounced kinda halfway between an American pronunciation of “uh” and “oh” with the emphasis in the second syllable."

2624,2020-10-08 20:52:01,j7bmym,TIL Sam Raimi and Sam Email is same thing
2625,2020-10-08 20:31:48,j7bmym,......

2627,2020-10-09 09:12:03,j7bmym,It’s called getting old
2628,2020-10-08 18:32:03,j7bmym,"It's not a remake of the korean movie ""mother/murder"" is it?"
2629,2020-10-08 18:52:14,j7bmym,It has made my day that Sam Raimi was referred to as Joxer's brother.

2631,2020-10-08 22:08:53,j7bmym,"Uma means horse in japanese. Sandra Oh I believe is japanese. So I'm guessing that at least through allegory, this will be a live action bojack adaptation"
2632,2020-10-08 23:37:44,j7bmym,"The description in the article seems a lot different. 

>Umma, which is the Korean word for “mother,” follows Amanda (Oh) and her daughter living a quiet life on an American farm, but when the remains of her estranged mother arrive from Korea, Amanda becomes haunted by the fear of turning into her own mother."

2640,2020-10-08 05:47:50,j72qrq,Oh my gosh I remember that scene😂!! She bought for a dollar or something and was so happy about it!
2641,2020-10-08 04:37:35,j6y7t2,"Oh you just now that Sandra is going full ham in this one. If anything, Killing Eve prepared her for this. Love to see it"
2642,2020-10-08 14:33:00,j6y7t2,Producer Sam Raimi has been attached to some absolute dogshit lately but this sounds interesting.
2643,2020-10-08 01:08:59,j6y7t2,Ohhhh! Can’t wait!
2644,2020-10-07 23:57:20,j6y7n9,Soooooo it’s a horror movie version of the progressive insurance commercials?

2648,2020-10-08 00:16:50,j6y7n9,Not as scary as yours though
2649,2020-10-06 23:30:13,j6fh58,I think it is Meredith and Derek for me. Ellen and Patrick had some crazy chemistry together.
2650,2020-10-07 01:03:10,j6fh58,"Izzie and Alex. And though I don’t like Mcdreamy much but he shares a great chemistry with Meredith. And I think Callie and Arizona were also so great. One of the best homosexual relationships with great chemistry I have seen in recent times. So for me -
Izzex > Merder > Callizona (3 couples with great chemistry)"
2651,2020-10-07 04:53:26,j6fh58,"Japril, Izzex, Calzona, Slexie and Merder. We could make a huge list of pros and cons about each couple but there is no denying their chemistry is off the charts."
2652,2020-10-07 00:43:55,j6fh58,Japril
2653,2020-10-07 00:06:15,j6fh58,I think izzie and alex. Katherine and Justin had good chemistry.
2654,2020-10-07 04:25:21,j6fh58,Callie and Arizona
2655,2020-10-07 07:21:49,j6fh58,It would be Japril and Calzona for me. I don't know why they make the best couples toxic.
2656,2020-10-07 09:51:32,j6fh58,Japril all the way
2657,2020-10-06 22:58:58,j6fh58,I agree. I think he had great chemistry with Amelia too. Like when I saw they were going to go there so soon I rolled by eyes but by 11x11 I was sold.
2658,2020-10-07 04:04:47,j6fh58,"I liked Meredith and Riggs. 

Also could feel chemistry starting between Meredith and Hayes at the end of the season.

Arizona and Callie were good"
2659,2020-10-08 02:29:37,j6fh58,"I wish there was Amelia/ Arizona 
And Meredith/ Andy (s19)"
2660,2020-10-12 23:16:03,j6fh58,Definitely not izzex but I agree with the others. (Personally I have to go with Calzona)
2661,2020-10-07 05:53:25,j6fh58,I hate Japril as a couple. But I'm gonna have to agree the actors had such great chemistry together. They were explosive and believable that they were hot for each other. Really good chemistry.
2662,2020-10-07 05:55:04,j6fh58,Oh yes!! Jessica is amazing and Sara too. I believed they were a lesbian couple. They were off the charts compatible. It's my favorite couple. I loved together so much.
2663,2020-10-07 00:00:06,j6fh58,Absolutely...The scenes with Betty and Leo prove that even more.Link and the actor playing him are awsome but i dont see the chemistry we r talking about
2664,2020-10-13 02:11:01,j6fh58,"In terms of chemistry I think they are, but that’s just my opinion."

2671,2020-10-05 16:19:43,j5kkc5,"Izzie wasn't planned to be shot in the shooting, they have said that they didn't have any plans for her character for the finale, that was just a rumor that has been circulating recently. There are some other speculative things you said that I have never heard before and don't necessarily think are true, but I agree with your overall sentiment. I think it's really unprofessional to mess with characters because you don't like the actor. It's just disrespectful to the characters and the world you have created. Who is going to want to sign on to act on a show, getting attached to their character and always trying to do right by them, when they know that if they make one wrong move, not only will they be fired, but their character will be punished too?"
2672,2020-10-05 17:45:26,j5kkc5,Did Justin Chambers steal Shonda’s firstborn because he got hosed.
2673,2020-10-05 23:26:48,j5kkc5,"I just saw the trailer and I am mad too. Like come on Grey's Anatomy is not Grey's anantomy without george, izzie, and derek. Like could they be more petty. issues or not that is just disrespectful to the fans."
2674,2020-10-06 02:52:23,j5kkc5,"There is a reason why I don’t like Shonda much. And that tribute of 300 episodes what were they thinking. Greys would have never achieved so much without Heighl, Patrick and Knight. And one more thing she doesn’t care about the fans of the show. Like Heighl could have appeared during last episode of Chamber but all we get some stupid screenshots. There is a reason why so many good actors have left and I must say Shonda is one of the main reasons. And this tribute was so sick and manipulative of Shonda."
2675,2020-10-06 00:25:53,j5kkc5,"I had never seen that video and I can’t believe how carefully edited it had to be to only show Derek and Izzie from behind (barely in the shot and being spoken to so the viewer has to *know* the scene to recognize them) and absolutely no George or Burke (that I can tell) 
Wowwwwwwww I’m kind of impressed"
2676,2020-10-06 01:50:22,j5kkc5,"Preach! If I were ever to run a show, I would never let my personal feelings about the actors get in the way of the quality of the show! So much of this beef jeopardised the quality of GA and the cracks show when watching..."
2677,2020-10-06 03:21:08,j5kkc5,An upvote for all your effort!
2678,2020-10-05 22:40:50,j5kkc5,"People keep saying things like this but it's not true. Shonda and TR are on great terms rn and have been this way for at least 5 years, so him not being shown in the 300 episode promo isn't because of some alleged beef."
2679,2020-10-05 21:44:17,j5kkc5,"Not to mention the disrespect that it is to the audience, that has devoted their time to the show for however many years only to see their favorites with a shitty end. This doesn’t apply only to the killed off characters, but I feel 90% of the cast that has left got a shitty end just out of pure spite from the writers/Shonda."
2680,2020-10-06 01:13:11,j5kkc5,"I mean, he did 16 seasons and then left abruptly for his mental health. It would have been nice to come back and finish the season, but I think the writers did what they could."
2681,2020-10-05 08:40:55,j5fhe4,"From reading both posts.... Ow man, that *really* sucks. I'm sad to hear you're in such a predicament.

Now, onto the tough decision. From what I'm reading/guessing, you're not based in a country with strong unions and backed strikes. So doing that would be akin to suicide by a thousand cuts. Plus, the hotel being such a shithole on a lifeline, it'll just sink faster. Plus no one seems to have the mental fortitude to be the ringleader - *do not under any circumstance* become the ringleader.

So you have in my opinion 2 options : keep sending CV's left right and center, and/or waiting out the storm for the other shoe to drop and see what happens. At this rate, it isn't a question of if the hotel goes belly up, but when. When that happens change will come, though what that will entail precisely is anyone's guess.

Hang in there, there's light at the end of the tunnel"
2682,2020-10-05 09:42:53,j5fhe4,"You said it's a franchise? So contact corporate for whatever flag you have. The owners/franchisees are more than likely violating all sorts of terms in their franchise contract, and corporate would love to hear about it."

from what you've described, everyone and i mean EVERYONE, has shut down emotionally and physically.

you're quickly losing hope in that your property will find some common ground with the environment and the staff.

i don't have much to offer other than, 

1) keep passing resumes and interviews

2) bank all that agreed upon overtime, if inclined. 

3) no enabling, for your GM. She needs to be held accountable for the staff she manages. if people call out, not your job to manage them.

finally, burn a sick day.  pick some rando busy day and call out like everyone else.

you deserve a sanity maintenance day just like everyone else."
2684,2020-10-05 14:31:20,j5fhe4,"Striking, unless you are union, is not a solution.  Keep up the job hunting.  I know that it takes a while, especially given the current situation, but you will find something.  In the meantime, just hang in there.  Corporate is not likely to be helpful."
2685,2020-10-05 10:59:14,j5fhe4,You can definitely call corporate and send in an anonymous tip. It’s the best way to go.
2686,2020-10-05 16:38:28,j5fhe4,"Striking might save the business if a strike is what drags corporate onto the site and cleans things up, but part of that clean up will likely remove whoever was involved in the strike."
2687,2020-10-05 08:54:57,j5fhe4,"It's not necessarily that I live in a country where unions aren't a thing, it's a case of there just never having been one in the Hotel industry in America (at least as far as I know.) Things are very loosely regulated here, except for the fact that normal taxes in addition to local and/or luxury taxes are charged at hotels depending on state laws as well as the hotel in question. The fact that we are a franchised location hurts because, as far as I know, I can call the parent company's corporate number, but since the hotel isn't corporately owned and we are keeping up with the franchise fees, I highly doubt they'll act upon my woes and suggest I take it to someone higher up on our side of things."
2688,2020-10-05 09:59:02,j5fhe4,"I'll have to see if that is a thing, I'm definitely going to at the very least contact corporate and ensure this information is anonymous."
2689,2020-10-05 22:11:28,j5fhe4,"I agree. Contact the brand, not the franchise or management company. They can’t force your hotel to comply, but if the hotel isn’t living up to standards then they will either have to shape up or loose their flag."
2690,2020-10-05 17:42:00,j5fhe4,"Do not call from your phone, or at least use a google number."
2691,2020-10-05 14:35:34,j5fhe4,"Another thought: try calling the same brand near you and see if they need anyone for na.  Explain you already work for a franchise location so are familiar with the software and procedures, but are looking for a change (due to some reason that is not dissatisfaction with your current location). Heck, try this with other brands too. Chances are you will find one with a vacancy.

I suggest direct contact, because you wouldn’t believe the crap one receives when advertising for staff.  It’s almost impossible to wade through."

2697,2020-09-29 13:02:51,j1y7q2,I think it is a pretty good season.
2698,2020-09-29 14:17:43,j1y7q2,"I wish the edit of South Pacific was a little bit kinder to Sophie. I get that they wanted to show a ton of Coach and Ozzy scenes with them being the returning players, but I don’t have any doubt in my mind that Sophie was the one pulling all of the strings. She and Coach were the clear number 1 & 2 of Upolo, which was a brilliant move for her as she was able to trounce him in FTC. Instead of packaging her as the lead strategist though they put her in the snarky role- similar to Courtney and Corinne, but I think she was without a doubt the actual strategic force of the season."
2699,2020-09-29 14:24:56,j1y7q2,"The one reason that Coach would never get my vote in SoPa is just because of his blatant hypocrisy throughout much of the season.

The biggest one I remember is when Ozzy outed him for wanting to go to F3 with Ozzy. After that tribal, Coach went crazy, cussing out Ozzy about his blatant jury management and how Ozzy broke his word to Coach.

Literally the next tribal council he stands up to hug the person he just betrayed in an act of... you guessed it, BLATANT JURY MANAGEMENT

Also Coach constantly breaks his word and outright lies while playing this ""holier than thou"" persona, the one that comes to mind is the Brandon vote. Coach is the swing vote between Brandon and Albert (voting for sophie) and sophie and rick (voting for albert). Iirc he makes promises to both sides, says he wont vote Brandon out if he gives up his necklace, then he proceeds to do it anyways, a perfect example of coach NOT KEEPING HIS WORD.

I understand that these tactics are just a part of the game and it's how the game is played, but coach tried to veil it under his honorable and loyal persona which really got to me (and was part of the reason he didnt win). Coach played a good strategic game overall, but the fact that he cant own up to it means he would never get my vote."
2700,2020-09-29 12:52:05,j1y7q2,Stephanie wasn’t robbed in Guatemala. She pissed more people off on the Jury and frankly was weaker physically than Danni. No chance she wins even if she wasn’t a returner.
2701,2020-09-29 14:49:06,j1y7q2,"You were drinking the kool-aid, together."
2702,2020-09-29 15:26:45,j1y7q2,I agree with everything you said minus the Danni slander she was much better then Stephanie who pissed everyone off not named Rafe.
2703,2020-09-29 14:04:21,j1y7q2,I was really pleasantly surprised by it! Especially as Redemption Island faded so fast in my estimation in retrospect.
2704,2020-09-29 15:24:59,j1y7q2,"That is totally fair. I get the sense that she got an uneven edit. In the beginning, we saw glimpses of an awesome, well rounded player. But as the season wore on, we got more and more of just this, conniving behind a tree moments? It felt a bit incongruous with my first impression of her."
2705,2020-09-29 15:30:27,j1y7q2,"oh absolutely! I think I was happier that Sophie had won. I think it is in part my shock for not rooting *against* coach that made me root for him? And I feel like it is his deeply flawed sense of self that made this season so memorable.

(I might just also, from the perspective of the audience, relish a deeply conflicting anti-hero!)

EDIT: my eyes were rolling very loudly during that whatever-it-was with Ozzy!"
2706,2020-09-29 14:02:02,j1y7q2,"u/Just-Stitious I was (mostly) joking! I was not a Danni fan, but total respect for a serious underdog victor. And honestly, Steph made a lot of unnecessary moves which ultimately undermined her chances.  

And to say someone was ""robbed"" ignores all the intricacies of the game of survivor. As audience, we can talk ""shoulda, coulda, woulda"" till the cows come home. But a victory is a victory. I might not always like it, but I gotta respect it!"
2707,2020-09-29 14:58:33,j1y7q2,I think that’s the point tho... she was screwed from the jump and still made the big moves necessary. I love Danni but I agree that Steph was *somewhat* robbed on Guatemala because she played the strongest strategic game and never had the jury votes to begin with because of bitter new players
2708,2020-09-29 15:31:26,j1y7q2,haha! Guilty!
2709,2020-09-29 16:25:35,j1y7q2,"haha, that is totally fair! Even though I did not find her the most riveting player, she was a great competitor, and her win was truly impressive."
2710,2020-09-29 15:36:44,j1y7q2,"I think part of the issue was that her game consisted of holding the line and maintaining the status quo. Not exactly riveting gameplay but it sure was effective. Keeping her ducks in a row and freezing Savaii out, while a winning game strategy, did not give the producers much to work with besides cutting confessionals and whispered strategy talks with Coach and Albert. That final 3 was perfect for her though and she knew it. Coach looked like an overly zealot hypocrite and Albert had a slimy, used car salesman vibe - especially after the whole necklace situation with Brandon. While during the game she seemed a little cold, I think the jury respected her for being herself and mostly honest throughout. Plus her FTC performance was brilliant. It was sharp, cunning and biting. The young girl comment about Coach is phenomenal, and calling out the fake Upolu idol hunt is an underrated moment as well"
2711,2020-09-29 17:05:27,j1y7q2,She was in the majority the entire time and bullied Lydia... Also the majority acted like spoiled children. Not really sure what strategic plays she made.
2712,2020-09-29 17:54:57,j1y7q2,"i honestly think ""when i met coach i saw him as the equivalent of a young girl"" is a serious contender for best survivor quote ever"
2713,2020-09-29 16:29:17,j1y7q2,"Oh my goodness, that fake idol hunt! That was was a great FTC bomb, especially because I had forgotten that had even happened by then. 

I agree about the less-dramatic-TV quality to her gameplay. In a season without coach, she might have been the center of the edit. But no one is taking the spotlight from the cult-leading dragon slayer!"
2714,2020-09-29 18:36:29,j1y7q2,"Sophie's comment about Coach was the same kind that Parvati dropped about Russell at FTC.

I do think it's a great line, though it might be very much a 'know your audience' line."
2715,2020-12-18 03:46:03,j1y7q2,You could easily say it was a line that revealed some internalized misogyny as well.

2735,2020-09-24 18:12:19,iz26y0,"It’s not ‘Hollywood’ just the top level of executives who will pump hundreds of millions into cookie-cutter franchises but not take a risk on BIPOC stories. But representation is only increasing every year. Ignore the awards shows, look at the broad picture. You have rising leading actors like Constance Wu, Randall Park, Gemma Chan, Henry Golding, Awkwafina, recent films like The Farewell, Crazy Rich Asians, Mulan, Lucky Grandma, Netflix’s The Half Of It, Always Be My Maybe, and their To All The Boys franchise, shows like Fresh Off The Boat, Kim’s Convenience, upcoming films like Marvel’s Shang-Chi, the Crazy Rich Asians sequel. I promise you, it’s getting better, and will be even more by the time you break into the industry. We won’t see representation improve by taking the back seat. As a Latinx man, I know I have to put myself out there to see my people represented as more than gang members and drug dealers on TV. Best of luck to you!!"
2736,2020-09-24 19:37:54,iz26y0,"As an Asian American actor, I encourage you to keep pursuing it if this is something you love and enjoy. Aside from the industry finally starting to value diversity, more roles are being written with open ethnicity in mind. Here’s the thing though, while a role may be casted as open ethnicity, they’re always going to go with the best fit and if there aren’t as many Asians or other POCs submitting for the role, then the chances of them casting one aren’t as high. The best thing you can do is to keep training and be good and ready for those opportunities. They’ll come."
2737,2020-09-24 19:44:49,iz26y0,"I am of half-East Asian descent, but that's my dominant phenotype.

On the A-list, yes, East Asian-descended actors are rare. But when I see broadcast TV guest stars, I see plenty of East Asian-descended actors. They might not be household names, but often I'll be like ""Oh, hm. That person looks familiar.""

I can't make the decision for you, but the outlook isn't so bleak that I wouldn't pursue it.

(And, frankly, 'working actor without celebrity' is a great place to be.)"
2738,2020-09-25 12:35:46,iz26y0,Me being a south Asian 🙃but the industry is improving in terms of diversity...
2739,2020-09-28 00:28:44,iz26y0,"It's a better time to be a POC in Hollywood than it ever has been, so there's that."
2740,2020-09-25 03:34:57,iz26y0,"Its hard for literally everyone. Its hard for POC for obvious reasons, now its getting difficult for white people as the push for diversity is happening."

https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0151654/

Also, what about Jackie Chan?

Certainly Asians are one of the smallest minorities represented in American media, though.

Whenever I think of this topic, I think of the American population. If the numbers of representation significantly (in the stats way) differ from the actual population, then something is wrong."
2742,2020-09-25 03:38:24,iz26y0,"uhm most definitely not, this argument is like an affirmative action argument and you provided me no answers to my question. 

There are more and more productions every year meaning more people are being hired (obviously not this year). There are no roles being taken from white people at all. If anything they are roles made for anyone that fill the requirements and they happen to chose a POC vs another bland white character. No one is making your life harder as a white person compared to POC who have to deal with oppression meaning they are not hiring you based on your race vs. white people who never have to worry about that"
2743,2020-09-25 12:38:38,iz26y0,"I think generally, Asians are among the smallest minority groups in the US but have the most representation in American film & TV, while Latin Americans are the least represented. Recent study showed that 16% of the US pop is Latin American, but get less than 5% of speaking roles in media."
2744,2020-09-25 13:16:07,iz26y0,"Geez, that’s atrocious. I’m just hoping more writers will write for the under-represented groups.

I know Dante Basco has been working hard to get more Asians represented. I wonder if other leaders in Latin-American film/TV are working to help their group, too."
2745,2020-09-25 13:55:14,iz26y0,"It’s not the writers, but the studio execs who need to be willing to take a $10 million risk on a BIPOC film instead of $150+ million on some sci-fi or action movie that’ll bomb. And Latin American actors are very vocal about it, and not just broadly increasing representation but breaking stereotypes when it comes to the roles we play; I.e.: more than drug dealers, criminals, gang members, hookers, etc"
2746,2020-09-25 13:59:06,iz26y0,"I totally agree it's the money, but it's also about the writers creating. 

Are there many Latin-Amerian writers writing content for Latin-Americans?

That was the thing I mentioned about Bosco -- he's helping Asian-Americans to write & create roles and shows for Asians, specifically. 

Rather than just being vocal about the issue, doing something about it is the next step."
2747,2020-09-25 16:33:56,iz26y0,"Believe me there are plenty. Every year for the past couple of years, the showrunners of One Day At A Time, the only show starring an all Latinx cast on TV, has had one or multiple pilots submitted, some picked up to film, and then not get the green light. It happens every year. The writers are there. The higher ups just don’t want to invest."
2748,2020-09-26 03:23:48,iz26y0,"Dang... I didn't know that, and it's sad to hear. It's like a cruel joke.

It's definitely okay to go to a new one. They are supposed to make you feel comfortable and remain neutral. Her comments are definitely weird and wrong of her. And if she's done this several times, you need to leave. She's creating the problem you went to her to see. You can be close af with a friend without being gay, support your friend, she needs it.

Maggie sucks.

Owen sucks.

16x16.

Why the Izzie hate?

Screw Krista.

Faceswap.

Character rank."
2752,2020-09-23 03:57:46,iy1z1j,"Ugh this is so true and I had this same thought earlier when I saw what was supposed to be a Bailey appreciation post have mostly comments about hating her and finding her annoying. The reason op made that post was because of all the hate Bailey gets lately, then everyone proceeded to comment how much they hate her."
2753,2020-09-23 10:57:36,iy1z1j,"But at least it is active.  There is always something on this sub.  Go to any other TV show sub and you might see one post per day.  Who posts about a show when there are no new episodes?  Yes, I'm tired of the repeats too, but I would rather have an active sub than no repeats."
2754,2020-09-23 02:51:58,iy1z1j,"To be honest I feel like here there is a little more debate or discussion than what goes down in the fandom in Twitter/Instagram, still though the fandom been like this for ages."
2755,2020-09-23 03:45:10,iy1z1j,"Agree with you, to me It looks like the old fans are nostalgic of old times and want the characters/songs/relationship they loved back against the reality of the actors lives and the new fans are obssessed with Merluca to a point where no matter the argument you give them to prefere Mer with Mcwidow they'll acuse you saying it's only because of their age gap. 

One thing I find intriguing about the fandom though is that here on Reddit most people dislike Owen (to say the least) but on Twitter a lot of people seem to love him deeply"
2756,2020-09-23 11:55:07,iy1z1j,But also Writers could write better storylines for fans to discuss 👀
2757,2020-09-23 07:57:13,iy1z1j,This! And if you have a different opinion you get immediately downvoted.
2758,2020-09-23 17:01:44,iy1z1j,"I get what you're saying, but I don't mind it, people are just expressing their opinions, which is what we're here to do. We see a lot of the same opinions and ideas around because new people are joining all the time and don't know how popular and common what they're saying is. And even if they did, they are still discussing and having fun, which is all that should matter. There's no way for people to know how often topics are discussed across the entire fandom, they just want to talk about a show they love with others. If these repeat posts annoy you, you don't have to read them."
2759,2020-09-23 13:10:41,iy1z1j,Not sure why this is wrong. Why is it wrong that a lot of people have the same opinion about something and want to share it?
2760,2020-09-23 18:44:35,iy1z1j,I know it can be annoying but you can skip the posts you don’t like or stop coming to this sub. I almost never post anything on my own but I appreciate the effort and sometimes even bravery others put to keep this sub alive.
2761,2020-09-30 04:38:42,iy1z1j,"I kinda agree. There are so many similar opinions on this page that sometimes I feel a little scared to share my unpopular one because I know it will just get ignored or hated on. And other times I just can’t tell anymore if an opinion I hold on a character/situation is because I truly feel that way, or if I have been swayed by the majority opinion here :/ but I do think it’s fine for people to share their opinions here, I just wish there was more room for respectful discussion and less arguing. I think a part of it is that on Reddit our names and pictures are anonymous so it’s easy to forget that we’re talking to people with an actual face and life lol"
2762,2020-09-24 01:18:42,iy1z1j,"Idk why, but this post instantly reminded me of the valid but overly dramatic annoyance seniors have for freshmen in high school lol."
2763,2020-09-23 09:42:08,iy1z1j,"The whole it should be cancelled now annoys me, like yeah lets put probably 100s of people out of a job because you dont like the show"
2764,2020-09-23 03:52:47,iy1z1j,"Don't forget all of  the ""Meredith should get Altheimers""  series predictions by everyone who seems to think they are the first person to present this idea. Even though there is at least one post a day, and certainly a zillion comments about it like it has never been discussed before lol"
2765,2020-09-23 09:26:03,iy1z1j,"So sick of those face swaps. Its fine if you want to make one, but put them all in the same post. We dont need like 10 of them in one day."
2766,2020-09-23 04:13:56,iy1z1j,I really want a separate subreddit because of all these reasons and one other weird demographic of greys fans that truly irritate me. These should literally be listed as ban rules 😂😂
2767,2020-09-23 11:11:46,iy1z1j,"Exactly, it was me who wrote that appreciation post for Bailey.  My intention was just to show that wonderful character but what I got was mostly negative responses."
2768,2020-09-23 04:07:28,iy1z1j,"Yup I remember this one... so frustrating. And people need to accept character's flaws ASAP, or their enjoyment of anything will be reduced to loving snowflakes."
2769,2020-09-30 04:32:13,iy1z1j,Truth!
2770,2020-09-23 04:09:30,iy1z1j,The Brazilian part of the fandom on Twitter hates him deeply lol
2771,2020-09-24 10:43:56,iy1z1j,"I think it's the other way around. I once said I like Merluca and had 5 downvotes in 1 hour or something. It's just not fun to discuss a TV show if you get downvoted, because you prefer a couple a lot of people dislike. That's actually why I stopped commenting on this subreddit, because of all the downvotes you get when you simple have different opinions."
2772,2020-09-23 15:33:12,iy1z1j,"Especially if you don't have characters like Derek as one of your favorites. I once expressed how I prefer Alex over Derek and someone replied asking me if I even watched the show because apparently Derek can do no wrong (he can and he has), but people like Alex, who's shown to be more loyal to people like  Mer and Cristina, can do everything wrong. Not that Alex is perfect, he's got his faults too, but he accepts them and tries to work on them. Meanwhile I feel Derek reroutes blame towards others, which is something I don't tolerate in real life, never mind on TV. It's like some people  here purposefully ignore  the fact that opinions other than theirs exist  in order to prove how right they are and how wrong everyone else is. It's honestly completely disgusting and I'm sure it's caused many people to not want to express how they feel because of it."
2773,2020-09-30 04:34:03,iy1z1j,"Ugh yes, so many people (myself included in the past) mis-use the downvote button. I didn’t know this until recently but it’s there for people to downvote _irrelevant posts or comments_, not for us to use when we disagree with something."
2774,2020-09-23 04:05:17,iy1z1j,"True (+the narration is the reading of the diary) and also the ""the series should end with Zola being a surgeon"" *sigh*"
2775,2020-09-23 04:05:13,iy1z1j,And everyone having seen it so much its buried in their brain as if they came up with THE WORLDS WORST ENDING
2776,2020-09-23 04:18:05,iy1z1j,"Yes! Every single character on this show has made mistakes and did or said something awful at one point in time. They all have their flaws, including fan favorites. When a show has gone on for 17 seasons, it’s inevitable that everyone will do something we don’t like."
2777,2020-09-23 04:13:21,iy1z1j,"It's funny that in every grey's related post half the comments are in portuguese, looks like half the fandom is Brazilian (me included)"
2778,2020-09-23 16:53:44,iy1z1j,This!! All of this!!
2779,2020-09-30 14:17:01,iy1z1j,Yes I mis-used the downvote button in the past as well. It wasn't until some moderator on a sub (wasn't this one) reminded us that it's not a disagreement button. Then I actually understood the real purpose and I wish more people would use it correctly. So discussions on TV shows would be a lot more fun and interesting.
2780,2020-09-23 04:11:34,iy1z1j,"Yes, and saying ""Its a beautiful day to save lives"" 😂😂😂"
2781,2020-09-23 05:49:31,iy1z1j,Despite the fact literally every regular apart from like six had done a voice over
2782,2020-09-23 04:10:59,iy1z1j,Lol yes
2783,2020-09-23 10:55:53,ixatks,Lose the definition of insanity line... It's not correct and it literally made me sigh and stop reading
2784,2020-09-21 23:33:31,ixatks,"I dooo have to ask, is this just a snippet from the middle of a story, is this the introduction? Where exactly is this located in relation to the story?  Is it meant to continue after this? Just need a little context."
2785,2020-09-21 23:54:12,ixatks,Your dialogue comes off as quite expository and lacks internal function - it isn't realistic for the characters to say the things they are saying
2786,2020-09-23 15:20:52,ixatks,"I'm sorry but have to respectfully disagree. You are taking things much to literally. Most people know that's not the literal definition of insanity, it's just a common saying about the futility of repeating actions over and over, doing things the same way you failed and expecting to succeed. That's like being bothered by the term 'Get out of hand' or 'Better late than never', they don't have to be accurate but are just sayings and idioms with commonly excepted meanings. I'm not sure how you have gotten so far in reading and writing if you can't handle these kind of things. Thank you for trying but this isn't hugely helpful, especially if you stopped at the second line in the text..."
2787,2020-09-21 23:53:53,ixatks,"About a chapter in, still near the beginning but past the intro, I can post the intro as well if you want."
2788,2020-09-22 00:02:03,ixatks,"Okay, how so? How would I improve that?"
2789,2020-09-24 07:42:43,ixatks,"""Get out of hand"" and ""better late than never"" aren't commonly associated with a specific fictional character, Vaas from the farcry games... I would argue it's always helpful to know when a potential reader has decided not to continue. The fact that that was the second line of text told me that i didn't want to waste my time reading the rest as it came off as incredibly unoriginal. No need to get defensive."
2790,2020-09-30 02:19:51,ixatks,"Your writing will improve if you remove all the clichés and replace them with your own descriptions. For example instead of using the phrase ""broken faucet"" describe in detail how the blood burst from his wound and splattered on the wall.  Try to add more details about the settings and  each of the characters' motives."
2791,2020-09-22 00:20:00,ixatks,"Ill give you an example with your first bit of dialogue, which immediately comes out as expository of what you might do.

Option 1: Cut out the  “You aren't going to be able to hit me like this. I’ve clearly shown that I am much faster than both your bullets and your spells."" The only realistic option a character would say this is if the people he's speaking two are colossal morons.

If you leave it at just ""Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result is the definition of insanity"", that tells everything that needs to be said, and just this dialogue paired with other internal thoughts and/or actions of the Demon King would have subtext. You want subtext in your dialogue.

Option 2: Tell the story from the POV of the students, their thoughts and struggles, and this actually leaves a bit more room for some expository dialogue. For example: you might actually have some dialogue like ""Damn it, he's too fast"" and then weave in an explanation naturally.

&#x200B;

A lot of the things that characters are asking about, aren't they things they should already know?"
2792,2020-09-24 16:35:48,ixatks,"Sorry, your right about me being defensive I posted the first one right as I was getting up and was grumpy, Although to be fair the way you came off both here and in the original comment was sort of passive-aggressive. I know that's the pot calling the kettle black but... Also, although you may associate the definition of insanity line with Vaas from Far Cry, it's more associated with Albert Einstein, who people claim made the quote even though he never said that. I don't think everyone associates it with Far cry because that's not where it's originally from.  Your second point would be true if you had stopped for reasons like ‘I don't like the premise’ or my poor Grammar bothered you. Stopping because you don't like one line is about as useful as you going to judge a cooking contest and responding to a ccontest “with I don't like macaroni” at that point you're not judging based on the quality of the dish, you're not talking about how well the pasta is cooked, or if the cheese is properly melted. That's not helpful, and at that point you just shouldn't say anything. I'm not bothered because you said something negative about my work. I've been changing stuff based on critique I've gotten on other subs all day. I'm bothered because you can't even be bother to properly critique the work asking for critique, before commenting. I would take your critique if you had even read to the halfway point. I may not use it but I would definitely be more receptive, but all I get from you is someone giving me an opinion, without even having read the thing that they're giving an opinion on past the second line,  which they just had to quit because of a saying that they think it's from Far Cry, the same way a little kid thinks that a popular song is from tiktok or John Wick from fortnite. and even if it was from Far Cry I could have been making a reference but since it's not I wasn't.

The demon King sighed as he continued to effortlessly Dodge the hail of bullets and magical fire Giel an Ellie Sent his way.
 
“How is he so fast?!” Geil muttered “WHY is he so fast, I-It doesn't even make sense, I don't even see his feet moving!”

“Just keep shooting we have to him eventually.” Ellie growled 
 
“Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result is the definition of insanity, are you insane?” The Demon king asked holding up one claw.

“I'd be insane if I listened to you” Ellie said still casting, “for all we know this method is your one weakness, and that's why you're trying so hard to get us to stop doing it”"

1. The Demon King is even faster than what they're used to
2. Geil is more remarking about how absurdly fast the Demon King is instead of asking about it

The last bit of dialogue Ellie talks about isn't something she should be saying to the Demon King, you don't tell your opponents what you're planning, it's something she'd more naturally say to Geil to try to reaffirm their chances of success."

that being said, its merits are overshadowed by the 2 OG titans: Borneo/Outback, Ethan/Lex/Big Tom's sheer likability and over-all epic production values of Africa (which probably wouldve carried over had it not been for 9/11 and season 4 had taken place in Jordan instead of Nuku Hiva)and the back-to-back masterpiece seasons of Amazon/Pearl Islands."

I do not want it to end with Meredith getting Alzheimer’s and talking to her children or whatever. Meredith always said that when she got to that point that she would want euthanasia. It was hard on her when Ellis was sick, as well as on Ellis.

I think what could be interesting, would be like either Meredith is in the early stages of Alzheimer’s and elects to get euthanasia. Or something happens like the girl in the coma episode, and she elects to pull the plug on herself. This way we could have a final episode where everyone (willing) who is alive could come back, and another where she crosses over and sees all the dead people, hence returning to her one true love Derek. I think it needs to feel like an actual end, and not just hints of a happy future with whomever. Since this show is basically Merediths story (from intern) I think it should be the end of her story."

Except that's not the question being asked here. Celebrity is a popularity contest, and the question is what is she more famous for, not which show is a higher quality. Artist A may be better than Artist B, but if B sells 10 million records compared to A's 750,000...then B is going to be more well-known by more people. And that's how ""fame"" is defined.

2876,2020-11-10 20:22:31,jqn7xt,">More people probably watch the golden globes than EITHER of those shows and she was on them thanks to killing eve.
 
She won her first GG 15 years ago thanks to Grey's, not Killing Eve. And roughly 18 million people watched the GGs when she hosted last year. Grey's most watched episode was **38 million people** when it aired after the super bowl in season 2! That is what catapulted the show and the actors were *everywhere* after that. You'd be hard pressed to find someone who hasn't at least heard of Grey's or seen their faces. You can't really say the same about Killing Eve because that show hasn't had the same cultural impact.

Look, for 10 years, she played what was arguably the most popular character on what is one of the most-watched shows *of all time.* I think you're seriously underestimating the cultural impact that Grey's had, especially at the time when this show first took off. Yeah, it's lost viewers, but even on its worst day Grey's is still in another league than Killing Eve on viewership. I'm not saying Killing Eve didn't add to her fame, but Grey's catapulted her career and made her who she is. There's no denying that. 


You could certainly break this down by demographics and say she's more famous for Killing Eve to certain people, possibly certain people under a certain age, or maybe even regionally. But if you're speaking generally.... it's Grey's hands down.

EDIT: You're also dismissing her role as just a side character on Grey's but by the end she was one of the highest paid actors on the show and made roughly the same as Patrick Dempsey and Ellen per episode. There's no way the network would have paid her that much if she didn't have the pull/popularity to justify that salary... but she did because she played one of, if not the most popular character on the show..."
2877,2020-11-11 14:55:23,jqn7xt,Why was the show suddenly so big?
2878,2020-11-11 17:50:17,jqn7xt,"Part of the reason it took off was the diversity of the cast...the blind casting was groundbreaking at the time, and it got a lot of press for that alone. Sandra was a huge part of that. It was desperately needed proof that network shows didn't have to be completely whitewashed, and that every actor didn't need to be a model in order for a show to be successful. The show itself was great and the diversity made it stand out, so people were fascinated by it. The Superbowl gave it the exposure it needed and it took off from there."

2903,2020-10-30 01:03:59,jkkb0t,"The episode did make me uncomfortable at times. For me it was a combination of the inability to escape reality, the so-so dialogue at times (my opinion, I still love the show), and that pretty much everything was *too real* for me. I am expecting my first kid soon, my dad couldn't raise me and so he wasn't a part of my life, mental health issues, disease, my mother is similar to Moore's character, etc. etc. It was entertaining, touching, but so close to home for me. I'm appreciative of Randall's storyline, the depiction of race issues from his perspective was sobering and humbling. It was very heavy-handed, though, and felt somewhat forced. But subtlety has never been TIU's strong point anyway."
2904,2020-10-30 04:43:24,jkkb0t,"well, they have referenced real events previously. this isn’t new to this is us. they have accurate nfl information in the show. hell, the episode we found out how jack died had footage from the super bowl played like an hour before. they have the vietnam war and the draft taking place in the show. that really happened. when they flash backed to around when tess was born, you saw obama/biden lawn signs. sylvester stallone plays himself."

But I think addressing the murder of George, the protests, the riots, and all the fall out from all of it. I think addressing these issues are all Important and may help open ppls eyes to finding better solutions for everyone."

2910,2020-10-30 11:28:01,jkkb0t,"I get your point about the writers’ taking a risk, but this is definitely not the first (or last) show to do this. Maybe in the days right after 9/11, tv shows should awkwardly steer around the subject as though it didnt happen.... but several shows plunged into discussing the results of the election in 2016. “The Good Fight” comes to mind. Some shows incorrectly assumed Hillary would be president and even put that into their scripts. The idea of holding back current events discussions (because it’s just “too soon” )has been dead for a while. Almost every medical show coming back this fall is going to focus on the pandemic, including Grey’s Anatomy. Unfortunately, the media wants to control the narrative every time they have your attention. The fact that NBC proudly stated that they wanted this episode to air early because of the election was striking to me. Maybe they would educate about issues people havent thought about? Wrong. We KNOW too much about these issues. If you watch any news, you’ve heard plenty of discussions. Is there anyone in the world who has not heard of covid? We can keep discussions going but with fictional examples, its not hard. In fact, it may help people see things in different contexts. It makes me sad that this show is under estimating its viewers."
2911,2020-10-30 14:02:54,jkkb0t,">how can they do flash-forwards a year, or even multiple years, into the future if they don't know whether the pandemic will be over and masks will still be necessary?

This is a quandary unique to TIU because yesterday, today, and tomorrow are interwoven in their Universe. And it doesn't just have to be politics and social unrest .... if the writers write in a Steelers Super Bowl win in the future for plot purposes, some viewers are gonna be disappointed if it doesn't occur IRL [think 10/21/15 for Back to the Future fans].

I did not watch the season premiere yet ... I am playing catch up.in Season 3 so I must walk gingerly on this sub. By the time I watch this episode, much of what they're showing will be old news and there will be other calamities in our world to need escape from. Of course, I still enjoy my Friends and HIMYM Universe where the Twin Towers are still standing.

Thank you for your well thought out and well presented thesis ... I'm afraid the writers were in damned if you dont damned if you do situation ... because it evoked such intense emotional reactions, it likely means they did their best."
2912,2020-11-02 06:38:03,jkkb0t,"Yes..I completely agree
 They set themselves up for failure as they cannot possibly keep up with or predict what will happen in the  real life timeline therefore this episode and possibly this season is an odd blip because it could be completely inaccurate very soon. Of course all this could change the flash forward too so it could become very messy"
2913,2020-10-30 01:18:19,jkkb0t,"Seriously now...people are dying...as they have for hundreds of years, simply because other people want to kill, but NO, YOU CAN'T BE ""UNCOMFORTABLE""!  Un fucking believable."
2914,2020-10-30 12:43:37,jkkb0t,"Ding. OP is right. The BLM material was hard but didn’t upset me as I felt it was necessary... But reliving the beginning of COVID was no fun. Overall, I was fine with the episode and had gotten myself back into the show...

Until that last goddamn shot."
2915,2020-10-30 18:36:43,jkkb0t,"The writing was clunky for sure. Deciding to take on two sensitive, complex events as central storylines is... bold. Also, they didn't plan for this in past flash-forwards, which makes it even more complex. They tried to catch us up to real life in two hours, but in doing so, breached topics totally removed from the pace of the ongoing storylines. It felt odd, but I get it.

South Park is the only show that has gotten the immediacy of IRL events down, but that's because they only have 5 days to make each episode. And they have a lot more wiggle room because their universe is DEFINITELY distinct from ours and they can use surrealism to write their way out of corners.

TIU writers are going to have a hard time keeping up if they attempt to keep the writing at the same pace as real life this season. They have now married themselves to depictions of IRL events. They're at the mercy of real life."
2916,2020-10-30 18:31:23,jkkb0t,"They definitely have, but I think those events are different because they were in the past and not currently ongoing. And events far in the past are definitely different! They are often integrated into TV shows. The Superbowl is a good example of breaking this convention, but the game's outcome didn't have a direct impact on the storyline."
2917,2020-10-30 18:11:58,jkkb0t,"And the adoption issue is magnified when you're adopted by a family of a different race. It's a unique situation, and an interesting lens through which to explore systemic racism."
2918,2020-10-30 18:13:19,jkkb0t,"THIS. I didn't mention this in my post, but I vaguely recall the characters referring to Trump vaguely as ""him"" without saying his name. The change in realism from convention to this hyper-realistic representation of our actual universe is shocking and stark."
2919,2020-10-30 18:11:00,jkkb0t,"I agree. It wouldn't have felt strange or out of place to me if they continued the show without the pandemic storyline.

I also wonder if it would have felt more ""natural"" if they had made up a fake racial incident that mirrored IRL events, but with fictional characters. This could have given them more creative control over the narrative while also allowing the characters to experience events similar to those actually happening.

  
Edit: To add to this train of thought, they could have had a fictional police brutality incident occur in Randall's district. That would have given him more direct interaction with the event, allowed us to see from behind-the-scenes how political systems are working to enable these things to happen, etc. He could have had a conflict with the city or with the police department and gotten into trying to overturn racist policies."
2920,2020-10-30 11:16:39,jkkb0t,How? Randall would of reacted that  way regarding the Floyd issue. The family would of reacted the that way regarding the be covid issue. It wasn't really pushed was a normal reaction. I would of been surprised if they didn't mention those two issues. The show seems real now.
2921,2020-10-30 18:23:21,jkkb0t,"Your 9/11 examples are a perfect representation of what I'm talking about! Of course, some shows did reference the event explicitly as TIU is doing here, and they are definitely not the first show to do this.

I think what makes this different is a few things:

* The convention of this show had been established in prior seasons: current events were only referenced vaguely. The sudden change in style to hyper-realism was surprising. 
* COVID is ongoing. While the effects of 9/11 unfolded over years, the immediate event was over within a day, and was ""in the past"". The challenge with COVID is that it isn't over, we don't have IRL resolution, and the writers are putting themselves at the mercy of an ongoing, unpredictable situation. 
* Your example of the election results being written into shows is a perfect demonstration of why this style of writing is so risky. What can you actually plan on as a writer? How will the reality be divergent from your expectations? You don't know until it's over. 
* How other shows depict the pandemic is going to be very different from what TIU did, I have a feeling. I suspect that some might make up a fake disease with a similar societal impact so that they retain control over in-universe timelines and events. Others will address it outright, but they may do so in reverse: only covering the time that has already passed IRL. Or they may make their focus narrower and focus on aspects of the pandemic that are more static and predictable. 

Anyway, I find the writing strategies and differing executions fascinating. If I were a current writer on a show, I would most likely take the safe path of making up fake events that mirror the real world, which allows me to retain control of the show universe while still relating to the experiences of my audience."
2922,2020-10-30 01:19:45,jkkb0t,"I think it's good that it made people uncomfortable, that's the point of the post."
2923,2020-10-30 21:23:50,jkkb0t,Yes it could be a make or break decision they've made. We will see! I just hope they lean into their strengths rather than trying for relevance too much. At the end of the day people will resonate with the interpersonal drama more than any one emergent topic.
2924,2020-10-30 20:15:24,jkkb0t,and we don’t know if the current storyline has a direct impact on the storyline. they could’ve integrated it but keep all the stories as originally intended
2925,2020-10-29 20:08:47,jkh8vy,Has there ever been an Asian-American film about sisterhood? This could be pretty interesting.

2941,2020-10-29 23:04:43,jkf3qn,"""Awkafina Is Nora From Queens"" was pretty fucking funny."
2942,2020-10-29 23:58:07,jkf3qn,"One's the square sister, and the other one is the wacko?

It'd be interesting if they played against type and had Awkwafina play the square and Sandra Oh play the crazy pothead lunatic."
2943,2020-10-30 00:09:13,jkf3qn,Hm. I don't really think they look anything alike. But I've known siblings like that. And maybe they'll be stepsiblings or something. But they're both great so I'm sure it'll be an awesome movie.

2955,2020-10-29 22:54:32,jkf3qn,Why is her name Awkwafina? Is it a play on the water? Is she awkward? Whats the deal?
2956,2020-10-30 15:38:50,jkf3qn,every time I read Awkwafina I think of Akinfenwa.

2980,2020-10-30 00:07:13,jkf3qn,Sandra looks like she can play younger and Awkwafina could play older if needed to make a smaller gap.
2981,2020-10-30 15:55:44,jkf3qn,It’s not like actors always play characters that are actually their own age. I’m sure the age difference will be smaller in story if their ages are ever explicitly mentioned.

2988,2020-10-30 17:52:26,jkf3qn,"Honestly, I kinda love them in those switched modes. Awkwafina in The Farewell was one of the best performances of last year, and Oh is an ultra-underrated comedic actress. She’s *so good* when she gets the chance to play wacky."

3004,2020-10-29 18:10:06,jkf3qn,Programme makers don't care about that anymore. Take a look at the sisters in The Walking Dead The World Beyond. They're not even the same racial group. Maybe it doesn't matter.

IIRC she started as a rapper, and was super awkward when she was younger...so her name is a pun on the water brand..."

3016,2020-10-29 22:03:53,jkf3qn,I actually thought it was more for some reason! Probably because I've been seeing Sandra Oh for just so much longer. I looked it up only after making the comment.

3034,2020-10-30 01:53:47,jkf3qn,I can’t speak to personality irl but she’s been good in everything I’ve seen her in — especially when she’s not doing her usual shtick. She was phenomenal in The Farewell and I was pleasantly surprised by her voice role in the Dark Crystal prequel series; it’s nothing spectacular but still fun to see her doing something against type.
3035,2020-10-30 01:46:23,jkf3qn,It’s her rapper name?!
3036,2020-10-30 20:37:35,jkf3qn,"How is a mononym stupid? It's as old as acting itself.

Do you also hate Molière and Voltaire for choosing single nonsensical words to replace their real names? Do you think that ""Jean-Baptiste Poquelin"" and ""François-Marie Arouet"" are better names and that they should've stuck with them?"

I could see if they were step or half sisters. That could be remotely believable."

3050,2020-10-29 22:44:19,jkf3qn,"I’m 12-17 years older than my 3 brothers and it definitely effects the nature of our relationship. I love them to death but I feel like my role in their lives has definitely transitioned because I haven’t lived with them since they were very young. I also assume it will continue to change as they get older and start living an adult life, I image I would be a confidante at that point. Helping them figure out the stuff that I didn’t really get help figuring out. I’m super happy about that though because it means I get to be another person on their team and ready to help them succeed in the adult world."
3051,2020-10-30 15:30:19,jkf3qn,Anything more than a decade definitely makes a big difference. You're almost more an aunt/uncle than a sibling.

3054,2020-10-30 14:42:17,jkf3qn,"Yep. Though I think that's mostly due to his partnership with Adam McKay, who also produced the show & directed the pilot."
3055,2020-10-31 03:15:32,jkf3qn,"Imo, it was the best movie of last year.

And it would've been a smash hit if anyone even knew it existed. Everyone I showed it to loved it.

Annapurna has some great movies, but they fucking suck at marketing them."
3056,2020-10-30 00:31:20,jkf3qn,He may have been the least enjoyable part but he was still really enjoyable. I think more of that he was good but McAdams and Stevens were great.
3057,2020-10-29 22:22:34,jkf3qn,Holmes and Watson caused me to start drinking.
3058,2020-10-29 23:53:28,jkf3qn,Snl has its moments but it’s not the place to pass judgement on a guest star. Live scripted comedy is not everyone’s strong point. Try one of her movies or check out some of her music and if you still don’t like her so be it
3059,2020-10-29 22:03:36,jkf3qn,100% recommend The Farewell to any cinephile. She's great in it and it was one of the best movies of last year.
3060,2020-10-29 18:43:11,jkf3qn,No duh. Thanks for the insightful wisdom.
3061,2020-10-29 18:58:13,jkf3qn,They aren't actually siblings. They are just going to be acting in roles that are siblings...

All same parents, we’ve got one dark skin, curly black hair, fair skin, darker straight brown hair, pale skin and dirty blonde, all different noses, different ears and face shapes... you get the idea.

There are lots of movies where people play siblings without looking alike. It's not a big deal. Way more important things should be considered when casting."
3081,2020-10-29 19:01:54,jkf3qn,"Tell me about it; On one occasion I showed a teacher a family picture where it was just us without our parents and they thought my brother and sister were married. She insisted I meant to say “sister in law” instead of sister. Nope. 

It’s always pretty incredible when movies or shows can cast people who look alike, but yeah it’s not always the case, as is life."

I had no clue who PWB was, I haven’t watched Fleabag by then, and I watched the first ep. on my own and I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, I was mesmerized and I couldn’t believe Villanelle was the same blonde girl from Dr. Foster, it was like seeing a different person. 

I fell in love with everything about the show, the writing, the dark comedy, the fashion, the cast, the aesthetics, the cinematography and the music and I’ve been loving it ever since."
3094,2020-10-26 17:13:13,jiek1c,"I haven't watched ""TV"" since Breaking Bad. But here's mine.

Friend: You will love Killing Eve.

Me: Naaah

Friend: but you like psych thrillers and spy stuff.

Me: Naaaah!

Friend: Sandra Oh's in it!

Me: Naaah!

Friend: It's gay.

Me: You son of a b*tch! I'm in!"
3095,2020-10-26 14:57:40,jiek1c,I missed the first season when it first aired. The second season was starting in about months time and I saw the posters advertising it. Something about it grabbed me and I watched the first season and never looked back.
3096,2020-10-26 14:26:36,jiek1c,I had friends recommend it for years but I don’t really watch “TV”. I pretty much only watch sports. Covid happened and by June I got so bored without sports and found myself on Hulu. I saw killing eve and remembered all my friends saying I would love it so I gave it a shot. Within 5 minutes of show I could tell I was going to love it. One week later I had finished 1/2 and paid for S3 on Amazon because I couldn’t wait. Haha. Since then I have rewatched 1-3 about 15-20 times. Obsessed much? 😬
3097,2020-10-26 15:13:52,jiek1c,"I first heard about it when Sandra left Grey's and she was cast for Killing Eve. But sadly I didn't watch it until after the second season was out. It was random but it was always in the back of my mind that Killing Eve might be a good one (though I didn't read/hear about any of it). And so, one fine day in 2019, I finally watched the first episode and I was blown away!! 🤯
I was like what was I doing all this time!! Binge watched both the seasons back to back. Fell in love with Jodie.

But, it actually became an obsession this year, while watching season 3. I actually deep dived, rewatched and got completely fascinated by these amazing actors and the job they did! 

Now, I could say I'm a die hard Killing Eve fan 😁❤"
3098,2020-10-26 17:34:30,jiek1c,I was and I'm still a Sandra stan so I was so happy to see her in a lead role. In fact I first heard about KE in the Sandra's Insta post from January 2017.
3099,2020-10-26 17:47:56,jiek1c,"I was keeping myself informed of Sandra Oh’s projects!  I loved her as Christina Yang.  I love her as Eve.  Once you start Killing Eve... there is no going back!  If I had to pick between Sandra playing Christina or Eve, I am picking Eve all day long!  I am thankful of the introduction to Jodie Comer and the lovely Fiona Shaw!!  Watching Killing Eve is a 3 generation connection as my daughter and I make a date every Sunday night and watch it and then call my mother (she lives 900 ish miles away) the next day on speaker phone to process it all. They are Fun times!!  It hurts we are probably a year and a half from season 4.  I would rather wait and have it true to the show than compromise.  Dang it, Covid-19!!😉"
3100,2020-10-26 21:42:30,jiek1c,"Scrolling thru Hulu and it popped up when season 1 was released.. started watching for Sandra Oh, stayed for Villaneve"
3101,2020-10-26 15:12:53,jiek1c,I remember seeing loads of advertising for the show before it came out and I'm a fan of Jodie and Sandra so I decided to give it a go. I got hooked immediately and I've been here ever since.
3102,2020-10-26 16:05:26,jiek1c,"watch the show because of Sandra, loved her in Grey’s. i was watching GoT during lockdown and came across last year Emmy’s where i was rooting for Emilia Clarke, and wondered who Jodie was (as she won, rightfully!)

so after i finished GoT, i started KE. never looked back since 😎"
3103,2020-10-26 16:35:39,jiek1c,"My friend who's gay kept telling me how much the show reminded her of me. Which I think is a compliment?

So I watched it eventually and am now concerningly into it."
3104,2020-10-26 18:25:35,jiek1c,"Was immensely bored, saw it, thought Jodie Comer looked amazing. Started watching it. Loved Sandrah Oh later (Geez such a good actress)"
3105,2020-10-26 22:19:13,jiek1c,"I saw the S1 trailer on BBCA (probably during Doctor Who, lol). KE was like nothing else on TV, I was hooked right from that scene in the ice cream shop!

Like so many others here, I can't seem to get anyone I know irl to watch KE. I am so glad to have this sub so I know I'm not alone in this crazy obsession!"
3106,2020-10-26 15:40:09,jiek1c,"I'd read about the show in Entertainment Weekly, admired the creative advertising for it from the beginning and always intended to watch it at some point. It wasn't until a few months ago that I finally did, though. I fell in love immediately. The spy genre is one of my favorites, but the show turned everything on its head and had such has unique approach. The women in powerful positions, both leads being women, the traditional feminine and masculine rolls flipped, the obsession, the intelligent writing, the amazing acting - it was all glorious. I couldn't stop thinking about it. I binged the first 2 season on Hulu and bought the 3rd immediately on Amazon. Since then, I can't stop thinking about the show. I've never obsessed about another show like this, but I've decided to embrace it and enjoy the deep dives and the postulating. So happy to have found others here willing to do the same!"
3107,2020-10-26 17:15:57,jiek1c,"I saw an edit on YouTube, and I put it on my to-watch list, forgot about it, then decided to watch it. And am I glad I started."
3108,2020-10-26 19:03:10,jiek1c,"Drove past a bus stop that had [this small poster ad](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/killing-eve/images/4/4d/Season1Poster.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200430194242) on the side. 

Although I was driving I made a mental note to look it up bc just based on that poster, I knew I’d love it. I saw the show hadnt premiered yet but I looked up when it would and added it to my calendar. Finally it came out, I watched the premier and confirmed that yes I do love it."
3109,2020-10-26 22:41:14,jiek1c,I read about KE via Entertainment Weekly. Missed the first episode but remembered to watch it when all the press releases mentioned the large jump in ratings. I've never looked back. Watched each season at least 4 times.
3110,2020-10-27 00:59:02,jiek1c,"I had seen villaneve content on twitter i think? I started this summer, so all three seasons were already out"
3111,2020-10-27 01:37:04,jiek1c,Discovered on Hulu. Watched an episode and was hooked!
3112,2020-10-27 02:42:10,jiek1c,"I think I first heard about it thanks to Rose and Rosie on YouTube (I watch them religiously), must have been in 2018. They uploaded a video where they reacted to several different gay things in the one video, and they were reviewing S1 of KE. I remember they talked particularly about how good Jodie was. I kept a mental note to watch it but it never stuck to the forefront of my brain, so skip to mid-2020 lockdowns and my cousin shared her Stan account with me. I was scrolling through, looking for something to watch and saw Killing Eve pop up. Was reminded this was buried somewhere on my list of to-watch, so I started it. And I just couldn't stop, I was utterly mesmerised. Finished all three seasons in about 5 days. I don't think I've had this reaction to any other show, and I'm a fangirl by nature. It's just SUCH a delicious show. 😍😍😍❤❤❤"
3113,2020-10-27 10:37:00,jiek1c,"I was SO SO sad when Sandra left Greys, and I saw she was in this new show written by PWB so I watched it as it aired in the UK. 

I went into it fully prepared to hate it and wish she’d stayed on Greys but within the first 10mins I was proved SO wrong. 

I’d seen Fiona in HP and Kim in The Bridge but Jodie was such a gorgeous surprise!"
3114,2020-10-27 15:29:42,jiek1c,"I first heard about it because I subscribe to Entertainment Weekly so I saw the cover story about the show and thought it was looked intriguing. But then I forgot about it until I heard the history-making news that Sandra Oh won a Golden Globe for it. I figured I'd give the show a shot. So glad I did because it's become one of my favorite shows ever! (And then because I loved the show so much and realized PWB wrote the first season and is an EP, I watched Fleabag and fell in love with that show as well.)"
3115,2020-10-29 07:29:21,jiek1c,"Someone told me I should watch it (I can't remember who because the person I thought confirmed that it wasn't them). Their reasoning was ""gay,"" which was the opposite of a draw to me. Despite being rather gay myself, I dislike most shows about/involving the topic. It took me another year before giving it a chance. I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't generic garbage, which hooked me pretty fast - around episode 2."
3116,2020-10-29 13:02:53,jiek1c,"I think I read about the show upcoming in Entertainment Weekly and my first thought was, ""Whoa, Sandra Oh is in a new show??"" I remember not really having seen her in anything since Grey's which I loved her in. Then I read about the plot and thought it looked good. To be honest the trailer didn't really pull me in until I saw the ""Issues"" one. My boyfriend downloaded it the summer after it came out and we binged the whole 1st season in 2 days. I remember watching it thinking, ""Wow this show is so weird"" but I hadn't seen anything like it and I loved it. By the end, I just kept thinking about it and became obsessed much like Eve/Villanelle are with each other.

That summer I remember telling all of my friends about it, my family, and I think about half of them ended up watching and loved it too."
3117,2020-10-30 11:10:12,jiek1c,"I started re watching Grey's Anatomy for the fifth time in 2018. Cristina Yang will always be one of my favourite characters on television. She's such an icon. Then I researched a bit about Sandra Oh because I was very curious about her work. Then I read an article about Killing Eve. I was very interested and I watched the first episode. I was immediately hooked. I started watching Killing Eve for Sandra Oh but I fell in love with Jodie Comer. I binge watched the first season within a day and I was mesmerised. Everything about the show is beautiful. Plus when I heard that Phoebe Waller Bridge wrote the script, I immediately knew that this series was damn good. This is one of the best series ever. I always tell my friends to watch it but they never listen to me. The characters are so complex and beautiful, especially Villanelle. Jodie Comer is an epitome of talent and beauty, she played this role amazingly. Nobody could have played the role of Villanelle better than Jodie. And Sandra Oh, Fiona Shaw always perform their roles in a very enchanting manner. Their performances get better with every season. I am literally obsessed with Killing Eve. One of the reasons why I love Killing Eve is that the writers don't make a big deal out of the characters' sexualities. Many other shows gets that aspect wrong, unfortunately. They portray the characters as just two people in love and this actually makes the audience, especially the queer audience very happy. Killing Eve is just amazing."
3118,2020-10-31 06:41:40,jiek1c,"I was on my 4th greys anatomy rewatch just for Sandra. And I was browsing through prime, I watched it for her initially but I stay for the gayness"
3119,2020-10-31 12:25:32,jiek1c,"KE doesn’t air in my country, so I first heard about it during the awards season, when they were nominated for many things. And when Sandra Oh won the Golden Globe I said to myself: I must watch this. But didn’t get to it until now. With the pandemic I had enough time to look for it online..."
3120,2020-10-31 16:46:00,jiek1c,"I kept seeing ads when it first started and never watched it. I saw ads for season 2, and I was like, well shit, I gotta watch it."
3121,2020-10-26 15:37:44,jiek1c,Yep my story is pretty much the same but I didn’t know Jodie from before and I still watch Grey’s anatomy because I’m too attached😭😂
3122,2020-10-26 17:38:52,jiek1c,"LOL!  

Any advice for when I recommend it to people and they ignore me?"
3123,2020-10-26 14:27:47,jiek1c,I'm glad you found it!
3124,2020-10-26 21:29:35,jiek1c,"Omg yes, I remember that! At the time of the Emmys I didn't watched KE either and as bad as GoT's last season was, I thought Emilia was the only cast member worthy of winning. I remember being so bummed out when Jodie won lmao. Now looking back to it I'm just so glad she did, Emilia is good but far from Comer's level, so it'd be kind of a waste if she never got one."
3125,2020-10-26 16:36:42,jiek1c,Which character?
3126,2020-10-26 15:41:23,jiek1c,"I just knew her from Dr. Foster and she plays Kate to perfection, but the one that stands out on that show is Suranne! And I found Jodie pretty, but that was it. The moment I saw her eating that ice cream in the first scene I couldn’t believe it was her, until I looked the cast up, and I’m pretty good with faces (I suck at remembering names haha). I truly believe Jodie gained more confidence and became an even better actress by playing Villanelle. 

And with Eve, I was like OMG this character resembles Yang so much hahaha.

And I tried to convince people to watch the show but no one did, until two of my friends did and they loved it (but they are straight, so the queer part didn’t hit them as me)."
3127,2020-10-30 11:14:40,jiek1c,"Well, I feel you. I think that all we can do is tell people as many times as possible but in the end if they don't want to watch it then it's honestly their loss. Because Killing Eve such a beautiful show"
3128,2020-10-30 11:14:48,jiek1c,"Well, I feel you. I think that all we can do is tell people as many times as possible but in the end if they don't want to watch it then it's honestly their loss. Because Killing Eve such a beautiful show"
3129,2020-10-31 12:22:34,jiek1c,I usually say: The killings are amazing... and then people look at me like: 😳 and then I go again: seriously! They are very imaginative. And you don’t see that much blood...
3130,2020-10-26 19:31:50,jiek1c,"Did I remind her of? I think Villanelle, but upon watching it I relate a lot to Eve, for various reasons."
3131,2020-10-26 16:09:58,jiek1c,"Ohh Yess Villanelle is such a dream job if you’re actor! She must be such a delight to play! So many characters in the one character. And for Sandra Oh I will watch anything she does because she plays everything to such perfection! 

And none of my friends watched KE too! Glad I found this sub and lovely people who love the show:)"
3132,2020-10-26 16:58:43,jiek1c,This sub is the best! Smart an funny people make smart and funny comments :)

3138,2020-10-24 07:37:03,jh3z7u,Yes. So true. Also love her in killing eve!!!
3139,2020-10-24 16:48:04,jh3z7u,Is this the episode where she feels bad about her hiding Burke’s tremor? Love this episode. Can’t believe she delivered amazing ness for ten years
3140,2020-10-24 23:14:29,jh3z7u,Agreed. 100%.
3141,2021-03-15 09:40:35,jh3z7u,This is my favorite episode of the series. The tension was expressed so beautifully.
3142,2020-10-24 07:48:58,jh3z7u,I haven’t watched killing eve yet.
3143,2020-10-24 17:34:20,jh3z7u,Yes! I don’t think I’ve watched this episode in maybe 8 years. I normally pick and choose specific ones to rewatch.
3144,2020-10-24 18:52:33,jh1quz,"I can't help but think the criticisms here are disingenuous.  Yes, there are many distinct Asian cultures, but one thing they all have in common is the lack of any representation in mainstream media.  So this is a win, even if it's focused on a particular Asian culture.  A rising tide lifts all boats.

And it's stupid to play the semantics game here anyway because whether it's Chinese or Korean culture, it's still ""Asian culture"", just as British culture is part of European culture.  

But again, it's clear the wording is meant to reference a group largely neglected by media.  Asian representation means highlighting all the different cultures and people within it, and that film is doing its part in that.  No one film is likely to hit every possible Asian culture, so it's silly to dismiss a film because it's only focusing on a particular Asian culture."
3145,2020-10-24 05:35:46,jh1quz,"Asia is my favorite country

3147,2020-10-24 11:22:38,jh1quz,Okay but when will Hollywood realize that Asia is not a monolith?
3148,2020-10-24 04:58:51,jh1quz,Oh is Korean.  Couldn’t they have found a Chinese actress?
3149,2020-10-24 14:26:36,jh1quz,Asian culture.... that's like talking about European culture or African culture. Unbelievably broad.

3151,2020-10-24 21:30:29,jh1quz,"Theyve done one of these animated cultural films for so many cultures, theyre great but I would love to see one about Italian or Italian American culture that isnt about the mafia."
3152,2020-10-24 20:32:08,jh1quz,A face made for animation.
3153,2020-10-24 19:17:29,jh1quz,"Thank you. I don't understand how people can call for more representation in Hollywood and then when we finally get a sliver of it, it's somehow bad. Asians have been severely underrepresented in significant roles until very recently, so this should absolutely be seen as a step in the right direction.

For me personally, my daughter is half Chinese and it makes me extremely happy to have children's movies/cast members that represent her."
3154,2020-10-25 11:55:26,jh1quz,Seriously as Dad to half chinese daughter it's great to have a decent production value movie that has an Chinese girl protagonist and highlighting though loosely the story behind moon festival. My only beef is them releasing it like a month after moon festival well after the moon festival hype has died down and we are in full Halloween mode. That was dumb. My 4 year requested to watch it again this morning. Not a Frozen level favorite but not bad for a Netflix film
3155,2020-10-24 09:54:10,jh1quz,From the interview Sandra Oh seems to give that impression.
3156,2020-10-24 15:53:12,jh1quz,Right up there with Africa as my favorite nationality
3157,2020-10-25 02:58:25,jh1quz,"I’m guessing you are either not Asian and/or haven’t seen the film. Obviously she could have been more specific, but it’s pretty clear what she means by her statement. Asians are sidelined in mainstream media and it’s cool they’re getting more representation."
3158,2020-10-25 05:33:08,jh1quz,"It’s America....

This is the same place that ended up labeling anyone from Europe the same ethnicity. Whiteness is as monolithic as Asianess for America."
3159,2020-10-24 13:27:13,jh1quz,"I don't think there's that many Chinese people out there, probably had a hard time finding one"
3160,2020-10-25 12:43:28,jh1quz,Oh is not Korean. She was born and raised in Canada.

3163,2020-10-24 12:41:02,jh1quz,Like half of all Koreans are hot.
3164,2020-10-24 19:19:01,jh1quz,"That's why I think the commenters here are actually the ""diversity is bad"" people trying to belittle some actual Asian representation."
3165,2020-10-25 21:10:26,jh1quz,"I agree with you about the lack of representation but I don't think it's nice for anyone to lump all Asian cultures (or African or European or anything for that matter) together. 
Also, I dunno but it just sucks [for me] that we have to settle for whatever tiny scraps of representation we get--no matter how good or bad. 

PS I'm not bashing the movie. I actually liked it."
3166,2020-10-25 20:42:07,jh1quz,"Dude, I am Asian as fuck. I am Filipino with a bit of Chinese. I also watched the movie already (which was warm and cute btw).

I get what you mean and I really am yearning for representation too but treating Asia like it's just one big country is not it. Every country is unique and that's not even counting the regional stuff a country have. It's like making a movie about France and saying it celebrates ""European culture"" when France's is far too different from, say, Greece or Norway. Somewhat related but the whole ""Asia as a monolith"" issue seems to be present again in another animated film through Disney's Raya 🙃

Anyway, she could've just said ""Chinese culture"" since that's what the movie focused on. Diaspora is wack."
3167,2021-02-07 11:51:29,jh1quz,Aren’t Asian sidelined cause they just don’t make up a large part of US population?
3168,2020-10-24 13:55:24,jh1quz,Because they're all too busy being doctors and lawyers?
3169,2020-10-26 17:16:56,jh1quz,"I'm not really sure what point you are trying to make here. These are very broad cultural definitions.

Indian, Arabic, and Japanese cultures for example are so different from each other that it seems bizarre to put them under one umbrella."
3170,2020-10-24 19:01:16,jh1quz,Damn you really thought you were clever huh
3171,2020-10-24 15:49:25,jh1quz,Nah. Their plastic surgeons' skills are hot.
3172,2020-10-24 22:54:56,jh1quz,Lmao wait what?
3173,2020-10-26 17:33:53,jh1quz,"What point are you trying to make?  Because something's broad it doesn't have meaning?  There are meanings to this, and in regards to this article it's pretty clear what is meant.  Asian cultures are often underrepresented in media.  Just because this film is about a specific Asian culture doesn't make it not Asian culture in film.

When we talk about media representation these larger categories are often used because the giant swathes of cultures and groups within them are equally underrepresented.  When we say more Asian representation is needed, it doesn't mean only Chinese or only Korean, but either would still work toward solving that problem.  

It's like if I say I'm starving and need some food and you give me a cheeseburger and say, ""Here's some food"".  It would be pointless to say ""Food?  That's a bit broad.""  It's still food, and it still solves hunger."
3174,2020-10-24 19:03:07,jh1quz,"No, just thought the other person was ignorant since they seemed perplexed by the meaning of Asian, European and African culture."
3175,2020-10-24 16:08:29,jh1quz,"Oh, fuck off.

EDIT: This subreddit is racist as hell."
3176,2020-10-24 16:09:58,jh1quz,Aw sorry I'm not a surgeon so I guess I touched a nerve there.
3177,2020-10-24 19:23:56,jgrb1y,"Whoa

> “Over the Moon” was written by her friend, Audrey Wells, who also wrote “The Hate U Give” and “Under the Tuscan Sun.” Wells had directed Oh in her directorial debut, 1999’s “Guinevere” and Oh wanted to be a part of her last project. Wells died of cancer before the movie was finished. 

I didn't realize this was the backstory at all.   How bittersweet.

Did you watch the film yet, u/IchiThKillr?   I still haven't yet."
3178,2020-10-24 19:42:46,jgrb1y,"Friend came over but internet went out so maybe tonight.. Still very excited! Let me know what you think!
But what a message to Wells’ daughter! That back story only adds another layer to this sweet, sweet cake 🥰"
3179,2020-10-25 01:33:00,jgrb1y,"It was soooo good.  A few parts made me want to cry.  Overall, paced well, funny, good voice acting, and sweet + fun characters.  

And, the materialistic, slightly capitalistic side of me wishes that there are some plushies, and other merchandise available for this film."
3180,2020-10-25 06:07:41,jgrb1y,"We watched it as well! Really great voice acting and fun animations as you mentioned! 
As someone who has to “get used to” a stepmom, I also appreciated the messages around accepting change and facing those difficult moments. 
If I end up with kids, this movie will definitely be on their playlist!"
3181,2020-10-23 15:57:17,jgosii,"Eve is such an interesting character, so opposite to V and at the same time similar, since they seem to read each other’s minds, I think V manipulates her in order to make Eve connect with her darker, sexy, raw side and Eve tries to make V “more human”, more connected, and in the process Eve gets bitchy trying to pull back but not being able to resist V’s charms and V gets more and more emotional in the process as she falls in love. 

I think all we have seen from Eve are her defense mechanisms and little glances of the kind and cool Eve, before her marriage got to the point of stagnation we see since the first episodes, but we lack her background and we don’t see her happy most of the time so she’s less likeable. S3 was the chance to explore and develop her character, but since they didn’t do that we’ll have to wait for S4!"
3182,2020-10-23 18:12:40,jgosii,"Damn, repulsive is a such harsh word to describe Eve... sure, she's frustrating at times, but then that's exactly what to expect from someone who is going on this crazy, emotionally/mentally tumultuous ride, involving an undercurrent of sexual awakening too, at a age when most women would be settling down and getting super comfy. So of course she is going to struggle and act in confusing and sometimes frustrating ways. She can't be as set and beguiling as V; in fact, I think at the beginning of the show she is positioned as the antithesis to V in most respects (except for her fascination with murder). I also think Eve's dark impulses make her, at times, more compelling and mysterious than V. Because we don't really understand where that comes from at all, whereas we can attribute the way V is to her psychopathy and tragic past. 

As for why she would be so attracted to Eve... aside from Eve being 'her type' and V's mommy issues... well, Villanelle is unpredictable, so it makes sense that she would be obsessed with someone like Eve who is so different than what you'd imagine a young, bewitching woman would go for. The show is subversive in this way and I'm all for it. If she went for another young super hot, 'resplendent' I-know-exactly-what-I-want white woman, that would be boring and overkill. My thoughts on that."
3183,2020-10-23 15:28:31,jgosii,"My wife agrees with you, and I'm the exact opposite. I love Eve. She's so cute, and quirky, and unconventionally attractive. She drives me a little nuts and I can't explain it."
3184,2020-10-23 17:36:42,jgosii,"I think Sandra is incredibly attractive, which of course makes Eve so. True, the character Eve is written to be a plain (which I think projects ""normal' when contrasted with V's wardrobe reflecting her psychopathic, over the top personality), sometimes unlikeable person who is undergoing some serious internal conflict.

V has been written as having a very specific ""type"" of woman, and Eve if of course that 'type'. It has been suggested that 'type' comes out of V's past, that she is seeking someone to fill more of a nurturing, motherly role that poor Oksana was denied as a child. She is also seeking someone who can give her some normalcy in her life (above I said, plain = normal) That being the case, Eve's physical appearance - the amazing hair! - isn't *the* attraction for V; it *triggers* the attraction, if that makes sense."
3185,2020-10-23 16:43:00,jgosii,Eve is a very attractive woman and a LOT of people think so to☺️ and her character is very interesting to me seeing her path to become dark Eve🙂.
3186,2020-10-23 16:28:29,jgosii,I think Eve is a very attractive woman
3187,2020-10-23 16:18:17,jgosii,"They are characters and they were made this way so it's ok. V is wild, sexy, dangerous, interesting, has the most interesting life you can imagine, she was made likable. Eve really is bland, it's a good word. I don't agree that she's not attractive, and absolutely don't agree that she should fall for Villanelle because V is all those things. It's not how it works. You can be the coolest person on earth, but this one person won't like you. Thankfully, this is not the case, Eve likes Villanelle, maybe even loves."
3188,2020-10-23 19:13:04,jgosii,"I think u have a problem with Sandra Oh, mate 😂"
3189,2020-10-23 15:37:51,jgosii,"“I don’t find her attractive at all and it was super frustrating to see her rebuff V’s advances.” did you ever think that the fact that V has literally killed Eve’s friends and is a literal assassin might be the reason?? you thinking that V is more attractive than Eve is NOT a reason that Eve should want to be w V. and bringing Sandra into it? that’s not cool. say what you want about the characters, but leave the actors and their appearance out of it"
3190,2020-10-23 17:55:13,jgosii,"I think it’s great because Eve craves what Villanelle has (adventure, drama, no inhibitions) and Villanelle wants to give that to her. At every turn Villanelle does things the most flamboyant way, whether it is a signal to Eve when she murders someone, or making her smell her perfume during a bus fight, it’s all drama and Villanelle I think gets power and a thrill from giving that to Eve. I like Eve because she is like a lot of people. Obsessed over serial killers, watching murder mysteries, working a boring job, in a fine relationship, not looking for anything exciting until the exciting thing tells you to wear your hair down and then kills your witness."
3191,2020-10-23 19:47:31,jgosii,Totally disagree
3192,2020-10-23 17:03:47,jgosii,Not some of y’all in the comments talking about Eves look cause that’s a real person who plays her wich means y’all are also talking about Sandra oh looks oof ( she’s very hot to me) and not some of y’all in the comments bringing Sandrah oh in this for some reason and slandering her some.
3193,2020-10-24 09:16:35,jgosii,"“Repulsive” -no. I can understand your frustration at her rebuffing V but only because I’m infatuated with V like so many others and would never rebuff her advances in a real world scenario. Also, I really want them to get together having read the book. However I feel eve has needed to rebuff V a number of times for the deep love to develop between the two of them. It’s less infatuation now and something more tender. I personally loved how their relationship developed in season 3 and how it ended. I’m really rooting for them in season 4"
3194,2020-10-23 19:54:33,jgosii,Also Sandra is gorgeaus❤️
3195,2020-10-23 16:55:48,jgosii,"These are complicated, flawed human/women, each has their own trials and tribulations; having their own agency is critical to them (they want it to be their own choices, when they’re ready).

Eve also serves as the surrogate for the audience (us).  It’s one thing to fantasize this carefree, exciting assassin’s life; it’s totally another when everything around you gets destroyed/turned upside down after the same assassin entered your life. When V said “don’t forget, the only thing that makes you interesting is me” - it’s also KE talking to us audiences, who mostly live a normal life.

I love the character Eve and find her mesmerizing, but what I stated above remains the same regardless."
3196,2020-10-24 05:51:13,jgosii,"Another very BIG reason that V is obsessed and attracted to Eve is because Eve has figured out that all these various kills spanning all over Europe belonged to V. Eve studied her kills, studied *her*, followed her kills and was actively in pursuit. For a psychopath with a narcissistic streak who is constantly bored, this kind of attention no doubt strokes her ego and is thrilling. And this kind of attention coming from an older woman with wild curly hair - bingo!!"
3197,2020-10-23 15:19:43,jgosii,"Haha. I kind of agree. But I’ve learned to “love” her for what she is. What drives me most crazy is how opposite she is to V with her facial expressions. She is so hard to read. I don’t know if it’s bad acting or intentional. I assume it’s intentional... my roommate and I have always thought eve was miscast with Sandra oh. That being said, she’s grown on me. But her wishy washyness drives me crazy. (For ex: throwing V cake over the roof, and then instantly looking sad or regretful) Idk why that scene drives me crazy! But it sums her up for me. Can’t make up her mind on wtf she wants. Which drives me mad. Haha"
3198,2020-10-23 18:02:19,jgosii,"V absolutely tries to manipulate Eve into releasing her monster, but do you think Eve is intentionally making an effort to help V become 'more human'?  I always thought of Eve's impact on V as an unintended side-effect of her obsession. I like the angle that Eve may be consciously trying to have an effect on V."
3199,2020-10-23 19:02:55,jgosii,I couldn’t have said it better myself. Thanks for putting them into words.
3200,2020-10-23 16:04:10,jgosii,"Picturing her eating that dudes Cheetos (?) and sniffing herself. Yup, pretty unconventional, lol."
3201,2020-10-23 15:46:24,jgosii,Yes I'm unequivocally sorry for that
3202,2020-10-23 18:15:53,jgosii,Great answer 👏
3203,2020-10-23 17:16:01,jgosii,"I think Sandra plays Eve intentionally hard to read at times to depict her denial. Eve seems to have buried her feelings and obsession for V so deep that she is not aware of them herself, at least not until recently. Sandra still has some incredible moments, especially when she is on screen with Jodie. Their chemistry is such that the majority of their communication is unspoken. What they say isn't nearly as important as their expressions and body language.

Eve is experiencing incredible internal turmoil. Her monster is coming to the surface, she keeps trying to push it back down. She's so drawn to her dark side yet she sweeps it under the carpet by faking normalcy. She has surrendered to her obsession with V, along with her feelings for her, while not even admitting to herself that is the case. Her family, her friends, her job - her whole life has been turned upside down. She hasn't processed any of it emotionally. So yeah, she is indeed all over the place."
3204,2020-10-23 16:47:09,jgosii,"That’s how it supposed to be Villanelles facial expressions are supposed to be like that because her character is supposed to be over the top, funny and childish, Eves character is supposed to be more serious, Sandra Oh is definitely not a bad actor at all, her work and other project that she’s been in speaks for themselves on how good of an actor she is. And I wouldn’t see anyone Playing Eve other than Sandra oh she was perfect for the role.why are u bringing Sandra oh into it and possibly slandering her?"
3205,2020-10-23 18:11:56,jgosii,"I think at first, both of them are studying each other, because they, sometimes read one another to perfection and sometimes they don’t, they search themselves in the other one and I think that’s why this show is so great. It’s not one thing or the other, there isn’t one truth, it’s the truth for each character. 

And also Eve is V’s obsession type (middle aged with curly dark hair) and V is Eve’s obsession type (female assassin who does her job really well + she’s hot and exciting). 

I think Eve is trying to prove the stereotype wrong, the believe that psychopaths are a certain way. If it is to justify her attraction and feel safer, maybe. If it is to just do research, I don’t think so, because I think Eve truly cares about V. But obviously their relationship has changed since the start. 

Her obsession makes her curious and test things, S2 is the perfect example of this, Eve testing V and pushing a situation to its limits, and V playing soft and manipulative and creating circumstances to bring Eve back, since she thought she has “left her for The Ghost”. But in this game they feel a lot of things and for us to not know exactly what those feelings are is great (my thoughts)."
3206,2020-10-23 16:55:36,jgosii,This made me snort!
3207,2020-10-23 15:49:39,jgosii,"I apologize for being antagonistic. disliking Eve’s character is valid, but the reasons you cite honestly seem hateful and maybe even a bit racist to me"
3208,2020-10-23 18:02:46,jgosii,"The hate Eve/Sandra gets around here is deep rooted in something...I don't wanna say what, but I think you know. I wish some people here just wouldn't mention her at all if they're only going to say hateful and disrespectful things. Like okay, you don't like Eve but talking about her looks? Low-key coming for Sandra's acting? Yeah, that's bullshit."
3209,2020-10-24 01:02:11,jgosii,"> they search themselves in the other one... It’s not one thing or the other, there isn’t one truth, it’s the truth for each character. 

I really like this! They search themselves in the other one. Very well put. And yes, the truth in KE is like everything else. Unclear, gray, muddled, and messy. And the show just puts it out there, so the truth each of us sees is probably at least just a little bit different.

Eve proves she feels differently about V when she's working The Ghost case. She wasn't worried about that woman's children, her life, or the trauma that V ultimately caused her. But she does worry about V's well-being.

I agree that it is great that the show is vague about the character's feelings (as well as so many other things, lol). It drives us crazy but it gets us to thinking. And it allows us each to interpret what we see in the show in our own, different ways (which leads to a lot of fun discussions on Reddit, haha!). It's similar to the songwriting trick: make the lyrics vague so that people can assign their own meaning to them. You appeal to far more people if they think the song is about them, lol."
3210,2020-10-23 17:50:00,jgosii,"You honestly shouldn’t be apologizing to OP. The post was very offensive and you had every right to call them out on it.

There are many ways for OP to say they are “put off by her know it all attitude”. Offending Sandra’s looks is  not even remotely acceptable."
3211,2020-10-23 15:55:54,jgosii,"I didn't intend to be a racist, I'm an Asian myself.. I unequivocally apologize for resorting to a poor choice of words for my rant. I just wanted to convey that I'm put off by her ""know it all"" attitude"
3212,2020-10-23 18:15:35,jgosii,"Fr, u literally said what I was thinking about the deep rooted thing, I just didn’t know how to put it into words and I didn’t want to say it. I feel like I’m constantly having to defend her in Every post that there is a topic about Eve or Sandra in this sub page, cause there’s always comments and even the post that don’t sit right with me. If I would of said something about Villanelles image or how she look the whole sub page would of been coming for me, cause they know damm well that when ur talking about how a character looks ur also talking about the actor,  or if I would of said something about j acting the whole sub page would of also come for me, the double standard here is so noticeable and crazy."
3213,2020-10-23 18:23:32,jgosii,"I agree with this... I always get the feeling that the people who don't like Eve, tend to not like her because they think Sandra Oh is physically unattractive, and how can they suspend their disbelief for so long - the idea that someone as young and gorgeous as V can be obsessed with someone who is ""old and unattractive"". Just seems like they get annoyed watching it and having to digest that."
3214,2020-10-24 03:03:26,jgosii,"This.

I usually comment in a lot of posts here in the sub, but this one was just too absurd on so many levels. Not only OP is being disrespectful by judging Sandra on her looks, but why would someone watch a show if they find the title character repulsive?"
3215,2020-10-24 05:17:06,jgosii,"It gets us to thinking indeed and there’s so much hidden, is like finding treasures all the time, because the more we know the characters, the more we go back and kind of understand their motivations (or we think we do). 

Exactly like song lyrics ❤️"
3216,2020-10-23 18:03:39,jgosii,"I honestly agree and I still stand by what I said. it’s just that I sometimes have a habit of coming on too strong and I wasn’t sure if I was too rude about it. there are other users who disagreed w OP but they did it in a way that wasn’t directly calling them out. but yeah, bringing her appearance into it is just rude and not at all relevant to their point"
3217,2020-10-23 15:59:55,jgosii,Anyway I reckon my mistake and edited it. You're right about it I shouldn't drag actors
3218,2020-10-23 19:20:59,jgosii,It's too noticeable to ignore especially when topics like this are posted coupled with a bunch of topics drooling over Villanelle/Jodie.
3219,2020-10-23 19:19:10,jgosii,"Yeah it's very obvious to me that some fans here dislike Eve because they simply don't like Sandra for whatever reasons. Crazy to me because she's literally the most unproblematic celebrity I can think of off the top of my head lol.

Also, Sandra is drop dead gorgeous... whoever thinks otherwise doesn't have good taste lol sorry not sorry."
3220,2020-10-23 18:30:01,jgosii,"I think there’s a lot more to it, they usually end up coming for Sandra"
3221,2020-10-25 17:33:19,jgosii,Hate to say it but there's some people in this fandom that only support Jodie and that's fine I suppose but they also tend to spew negativity when Sandra is mentioned.
3222,2020-10-23 16:09:26,jgosii,thank you for editing that part out. I apologize again if I was unnecessarily rude!! and I understand completely if Eve’s attitude throws you off. I know a lot of people feel the same way
3223,2020-10-23 19:47:39,jgosii,"Yes! I love Sandra Oh 😭 She's fun, extremely thoughtful and intelligent and omg her HAIRRR. These things alone make her super attractive, in a way that's more difficult to be/rare compared to your standard fare of attractive celebrities, who depend more on the 'gift' of their face than anything else."
3224,2020-10-28 14:40:39,jgosii,I guess you're ignoring the other side which is sandra fans on twitter shitting on jodie 24/7? people have preferences but trying to make it seem like it's one sided and sandra fans dont do the exact same thing is a lie.
3225,2020-10-23 19:52:06,jgosii,And how did I forget to mention this wtf... her VOICE.... 😍😍😍😍😍
3226,2020-10-23 21:47:03,jgosii,"Omg her voice is so soothing. I love listening to her interviews, she's so well spoken."

It was actually a post by /u/tfhwchoice that made me think about the stand alones. TFH brought up a point I hadn't thought about before: Sometimes people just want a clean, one-off story without a ton of required reading and such to understand. Just a one and done.

So since I already had a notecard tonight earmarked for checking in with the expanded world I just took Harland and Oscar's situation and built it around a standalone. It's not hard, just requires a bit more explaining and some explicit callouts!"

Real talk, though: You hit one of the things I'm always obsessing over-- *smooth writing flow*.

I'm entirely self taught. In fact I failed English almost the entire way through high school and squeaked through college papers by the skin on my gritted teeth bones. Put me in front of a grammar tutor and I'll turn that poor person into an alcoholic before the sun sets. My English structure is *so bad*, my liberties with punctuation and style *so viciously abusive* I was once called a literal curse on the very soul of written communication.

Quite proud of that, actually.

But I do read. Convulsively (not a typo). I earned my fear of the dark on Stephen King's ""It"" when I was *eleven years old*. Those shower drains? *Fuck those shower drains*. I couldn't put my foot over a sewer grate or touch the sink plug until I was damn near twenty-five.

Along the way towards conquering my fear of water pipes I read absolutely everything. Even romances and whatever the hell ""fantasy lit harem"" is. While I have absolutely no idea why things are written a certain way I can tell just by going over it if it *flows*. I'm a *flow* writer: I type *flow* sentences, then read them out loud until my neighbors scream synonyms at me through paper-thin walls.

So when you drop by and casually comment that *the story flows well* you've just accidentally given me the most incredible compliment you possibly could have, without even knowing beforehand. Like winning the lottery by finding a scratch off ticket in the trash. You weren't even *trying.* 

But that right there? You dunked on my night like old school Michael Jordan jumping from past the free throw line. Tongue out and screaming the whole way.

I'm going to go karate chop invisible ninjas and feel total happiness for a while."

This issue came up before on my previous post, this was the solution provided by Mega Support:

Open your MEGA account in a browser. Just before you are about to click 'Download' of the affected file press F12 (Option + cmd + J) to open your JavaScript Console. The screen will divide. Type 'skipcheck=1' in the bottom line of the Console, click 'Enter' and then select the 'Download' in your MEGA account window."

I'm not sure how my post come up since I have zero Elliot Smith in my collection, but I'm glad that it found you!

1. Copy the long code near the top of the post

2. Google ""base64"" and click on the first site that pops up (one that ends in .org), 

3. Make sure ""Decode"" is selected at the top once you're in the website (it should be the default)

4. Paste the code in the top field where it reads ""Type (or paste) here...""

5. Press ""< DECODE >""

6. The decoded link which would be a Mega link in this place will show up on the bottom field

7. Copy and paste this link to your URL and that should take you to my index

Hope that helps."

Most of the titles I only have one version of, so searching up the catalog numbers and including them to my organization system doesn't make much sense in my specific case. For the ones I have multiple versions of I do specify in the sub folders, to the best of my ability, which version's which. For the most part it is simply one click away to find out the number of tracks included that would then give you a clue as to whether it's a version you already have or not. Hope that helps."

Also by incomplete discographies, I wasn't talking about the index, but you don't have every Future or Kid Cudi studio album for example. I'm not telling you that you need to go find them, just saying. No mistake on Your Part. Also on another note there's a problem with the album ""live.love.asap"" which sounds all distorted on some songs, I just ended up sticking to my mp3 version of it."

It is probably either part of someone’s name that got cut off because the line was too short, or somebody just wanted their loved one’s first name to be shown. I know people are obsessed with the idea that Cristina will come back, but that definitely wasn’t suggesting that she is or that she will be a COVID casualty either.

Basically if a college participates in nearly any sport, it is likely goverened by the NCAA. Of course, Football is the most popular, but Basketball, Baseball, Volleyball, etc. are all covered.

One of the stipulations of students to be eligible to play is that they cannot be paid to do so and there are some heavy limits on prize money for events. The idea is they are students first, athletes second; I assume this is the point the Amateur Task Force was driving at."

I heard about the proposed rule change and, knowing very little about hunter/jumper world, was shocked by how strict they were! Cant accept payment for giving lessons to kid beginners, or riding other people’s horses because you’re too broke to afford your own, or receiving some tail conditioner to promote on your Insta without having to compete at a higher level?

So that's all how the amateur sections are all going to be shaped now, but how is that going to protect the amateur sections from being trounced at every turn by the person who rides 10-12 hours a day?

It just increases access for people who do have 10-12 hours of riding every day by saying ""and NOW you can get PAID!""

Speaking of quarter horses, we have so many not professional categories it's almost silly, but it has brought more people to the shows. There are 3 levels of amateur now based on show experience. Keeps the pro/heavily experienced amateurs in their own group. Makes the shows really long though."

Not sure if anyone in the industry could weigh in but my understanding has been over the years they have stopped allowing irritation of their legs to the point they get sores with chains and mustard or anything like that, and they regulate it pretty strictly. The idea of that stuff has always horrified me but when I was a kid I was taught that these days its the equivalent of adding weights to their legs or making them feel slightly annoying during training. Granted, my old mare was a washout from big showtime and she was just my trail baby but I grew up around a lot of the biggest names in the industry over the last 3 decades and I never once witnessed a single animal neglected or abused. No sores, no off behavior, no malnutrition or unsavory conditions.

Again, I'm too out of the loop to really speak to the show circuit as a whole, but that seems like a stereotype to me. I have never seen the behavior or signs of an abused animal from a walking horse in training, and I can only imagine someone amateur or desperate would try historical methods of 'encouraging' their gaited horse."

A rural pastor had trouble getting hold of enough money for church roof repairs. So the parish comes up with the idea to pool their money and buy a race horse. The collection is done, and when the pastor goes shopping, he only has enough for a donkey. Nonetheless he buys the donkey and enters it into the race. It places third.

The headlines run: ""*Pastor's Ass shows!!*"" Encouraged, he runs it a second time. this time it comes in first.

The headlines announce: *""Pastor's Ass out in front.""*

The Bishop is a little worried and talks to the pastor. He reluctantly gives the donkey over to the care of the local nunnery.

The headlines declare **""Mother Superior has best ass in town.""**

The Bishop chokes on his morning coffee and tells the Mother Superior to do something about it. Not having any other alternative, she sets the donkey free.

**""Mother Superior says her ass is wild and free!!""** is splashed across the front pages.

The Bishop starts a course of blood pressure medication and orders the donkey to be captured.

***""Bishop wants Mother Superior's ass!!!""*** scream the papers.

The Bishop is hospitalized. The donkey is caught ultimately and a picture of the pastor riding the donkey is published on the front page: ***""Pastor rides Mother Superior's Ass into town""***

The Bishop's funeral is on Sunday morning.

3500,2020-12-11 02:36:02,kajl5r,"The Mule Drama™️ has two sides:

1- people say that their horses are afraid of mules so the mules shouldn’t be allowed to compete. To that I say, I’ve seen more horses spooking at small ponies than mules, and I’ve been at a lot of shows with mules. Should ponies be banned too? 

2- people get pissed when a mule beats them, and I mean BIG PISSED. Especially when they’re at a recognized Dressage show.



An old friend I used to show with has mules, so I’ve seen all the reactions lol."

Those show horses are a massive industry and they take the health inspections extremely seriously.

The initial ride was really promising as the mule was absolutely fearless (as you'd expect) and didn't shy from the lance or dummies or strike noises at all, but last I checked they still hadn't done anything with him. I think partly that's because they needed a specialty saddle for him (mule shoulders!) and had to send off for it, but I'm not sure if there's anything else stopping him.

Personally I'd think a minor league system for football would provide a better alternative. Want to play sports professionally? Go to the minor league. Want to play sports inbetween classes? Go to college.
But that'll never happen unless we're magically in a perfect world. And even then, I'd entertain the argument that student athletes  should be paid.

Ok, there wasn’t any baking involved, but it got as ridiculous as you feasibly could.

To my knowledge, there are no legitimate drag racing hunts in the UK.

Yes, it's all in place now. Sandra is still supporting the UK arm of the business in regards to it - which is a relief as I remember making a joke about my German not being good enough to explain any issues with it to our colleagues in Germany.

The reason I thought she'd been hired back is that 3 others from her department were. They were let go in June or maybe early July, but came back in September as the transition wasn't going as smoothly as it should have done. They were on temp contracts from Sept-Nov. I left mid-Nov so no idea if they're still there or not. I know Sandra is as I've got her on FB now (I never add current colleagues to social media, the day I left I accepted about 30 friend requests from colleagues at that company) and she's been in touch to say everything IT-related has gone to shit since I left!"
3582,2020-12-15 19:22:13,kahajo,Was the wife really on a trip? Could the boss have switched the topic of conversation? Some people do this without properly stating the change of context. It's often done by non-academics and tends to confuse those used to keeping their mind disciplined.
3583,2020-12-11 08:13:12,kahajo,"Not that I remember!

It's real headfuck. It so definitely happened that it's weird for me that no-one else has any recollection of it."
3584,2020-12-10 18:02:37,kahajo,"I’ve had several near death experiences and I get the strangest feeling that I did actually die, but I somehow just transferred to a parallel dimension where I survived. I’m not sure. Things just seem to get weirder for me every time it happens. About 4-5 times."
3585,2020-12-10 18:16:07,kahajo,I’m interested in this too.
3586,2020-12-11 08:01:27,kahajo,"No, we couldn't actually go away as we'd planned due to Covid. The only bad thing that happened over my break was my daughter was diagnosed with Covid. She was asymptomatic though, tested a week later and no trace of it."
3587,2020-12-11 08:03:32,kahajo,"I did think that for a brief second - but there's no way she could have got all her stuff back. The office is locked at all times, the IT store is behind two access controlled doors - one of which she would have never had access to, even as an employee.

She's also very much not that type of person."
3588,2020-12-11 08:06:41,kahajo,"> Personally I think you most likely scenario is you probably don’t know the people employed there as well as you thought and mixed two people up with each other.

That was her explanation for things. There is another Sandra (who went by ""Sandie"") in that department, but she was a desktop user who was made redundant back in June. And she was also really not the sort of colleague who you could rely on to fix stuff. She'd usually be the problem!  
They didn't look alike in any way either, and Sandie drove a minivan, not an Audi TT."
3589,2020-12-11 14:47:16,kahajo,It’s so weird when that happens! It happens to some people more than others. Our brains are mysterious little computers made of meat...either way it’s a good story! I’d freak out too!
3590,2020-12-11 01:38:16,kahajo,That would suck. It’s weird how the things on your mind infiltrate your dreams so vividly. Besides nightmares the WORST dreams I have are getting up and going to work only to wake up when the alarm goes off and realize that I am still at home and NOW I have to go work some more! Except apparently while I’m awake.  Lol
3591,2020-12-11 18:53:00,kahajo,"It seems that phenomena very often happen unobserved and you have to get to quite advanced levels to see something change in front of your eyes.

Some psychics also say that they can do things alone but not so easily with other people watching. Also when making random selections with psi as a demonstration it does seem to help if the other person doesn't initially know what you are going to do, but write the target on a paper which you present folded at the start.

It really needs more research on this topic."

3597,2020-12-11 19:33:53,kahajo,"For sure.  This also reminds me of the remote viewing studies, where viewers would do equally well with geographical co-ordinates and with random numbers allocated to each target.  It reminds me also of some very informal experiements I did with my mother, who was extremely sensitive.  I wrote down the co-ordinates of several (maybe 8 or 9) targets on separate index cards, and asked her to look at them any time she felt like it.  Got two or three quite good readings, then one morning she went into the lounge with nothing in particular on her mind, glanced over at the stack of cards, and saw a small pyramid sitting on top of them.  As you will guess, when I checked the co-ordinates, the target on the top card was the Great Pyramid!  \[Incidentally, my mother had no idea what the geographicals meant, she thought they referred to feet and inches!\]"

3599,2020-12-13 11:41:56,kahajo,"Yes, so in that case while she wasn't watching something happened to bring out the idea behind the top card coordinates. 

Seems a better level of remote viewing really. I wonder if it could be called Apport Remote Viewing?"
3600,2020-12-13 13:12:58,kahajo,"She wasn't thinking about the cards at all.  I think by that time she had got fairly bored with them!  She could be frighteningly accurate, even during her final years when she had a total breakdown.  One day she spotted a neighbour's niece arriving next door and remarked, ""There's Corry, she's just come back from Australia.""  I used to speak to my neighbour quite often and when I saw her the next day she told me, ""Corry came to see me yesterday.  She's been in Australia!  She never told me she was going.""

I think the whole question of what exactly remote viewers are doing needs addressing.  To some extent the Stanford people confused matters when they did tests using people going to randomly selected sites, because clearly then the RVs could have been using telepathy rather than clairvoyance."
3601,2020-12-15 12:53:00,kahajo,"There does sometimes seem to be an intelligence behind these phenomena.

Do you know how your mother's abilities developed over time? Was she that psychic as a girl or just marginally so but always trying to learn and do such things? Perhaps an illness triggered it? Or maybe another psychic taught her?

The outbound subjects is a part of the more general training isn't it? Seemingly they found that people also had to be trained to pick up events on the correct day. They did this by selecting days (or one day) before a major event so the viewer could become precise. People training to do accurate psychic life readings do the same, the teacher can often be much more precise as to the date of a future event."
3602,2020-12-15 13:11:23,kahajo,"I think my mother's abilities were always there.  I recall her saying that an uncle with an interest in spiritualism had told her that she would make a good medium, but that did not appeal to her at all.  The most dramatic event, that changed her whole life, and mine too, indirectly, happened in 1928.  Her father was the head gardener at a mental nursing home, Bowden House in Harrow (founded by Hugh Crichton Miller, more famous for the Tavistock clinic).  The family had moved to a cottage on the grounds of the clinic, but her mother planned to visit their old neighbour farther down the hill.  That morning my mother came down and said she had dreamed that Joy, her little sister, had been killed.  Her mother didn't take any notice, and even when she spilled a whole box of salt was still determined to go out.  To cut it short, a high wind had come up and a tree was blown down on them.  Joy, in the pram, was killed (the pram was full of blood).  My mother, as you can guess, was never the same after that.  My childhood was dominated by drunken arguments between her and my grandmother.  Only much later did I realise that of course my mother blamed her for ignoring her warning and allowing Joy to die...  She carried on having mostly precognitive dreams -- dreamed about the air crash that killed a whole football team (I think it was Manchester).  

Given that the aim of the remote viewing was to see places they had to get info about, I felt that using a telepathy based training method wasn't quite the best idea!  Yes, I agree it is interesting that training had to include the date and time of the target event -- I suppose if viewers could detect (say) troop movements in a certain location but not know whether they had taken place years ago or in the future, their practical value would be much reduced!"
3603,2020-12-15 19:06:06,kahajo,"That she had the dream, told her mother and the accident still happened even with the input of the precognitive knowledge, it rather makes you wonder if it was a semi fixed event. I say semi because a big enough mental input might have shifted it; but note that a dream environment isn't one where it's easy to think about willing changes. (She might not have known to attempt to tackle it this way in any case.)

If so then your grandmother's determination to go out may not have come from any of her 'own' internal thought processes. We commonly assume that our thoughts are our own, but the more internal work I do, I find I get better at picking out externally generated feelings and thoughts.

Your mother, did she have any access to past life knowledge or ability to know it for others?"
3604,2020-12-15 19:12:21,kahajo,"Yes, I suspect that some things are indeed ""meant to be"" and can't be altered.  Years after that accident, during the war, my mother realised that Joy, had she survived, would have been of an age to be drafted for war service, probably in a munitions factory, a target for German bombing.  Maybe she was spared that.

No, she had no knowledge of or interest in past life knowledge.  In many ways she was a living advert for the dangers of having advanced perceptions without the necessary preparations for it.  There are so many different aspects and levels to such questions."

3614,2020-12-08 22:34:04,k9d3mb,"Here's what it sounds like to me as a movement specialist.

Im going to throw out some basic assumptions you might be able to relate to.

Because so many of us stare at our phones and computers all day, we tend to create an uneven pull towards the front of the body. This is due to muscular. So, because of a forward head posture (even slightly) your vertebrae within your spine is probably shifted forward a bit

So now add constant compression from jumping on the trampoline and its most likely something like a slipped disc which may also be compressing on a nerve.

If you haven't been working on your forward head posture (assumption) then it might be because the muscles are very tight in the front of the body (scalenes, pec minor, subclavius) and are continuing to create that compression on the discs.

So what to do?

Pay me! just kidding

You would need to get a massage and good stretching on those muscles I mentioned above and then you need to exercise the weaker muscles (usually rhomboids, deep cervical flexors) to start building a new posture. Go in that order.

I hope it helps.

3615,2020-12-09 03:07:18,k9d3mb,"I feel you. I injured my back at 12 and dealt with a lot of kids in sports making fun of my inability to compete or people not understanding how bad I was hurt. Please keep seeing a physio, and try to push your doctor to get an MRI. You need to know what is going on. I delayed my MRI for a year and really regret it because I could’ve known what was wrong instead of just trying to pretend nothing was. 12 years later, and the most important thing moment to moment is still physical therapy. Don’t make my mistake and sit too much!"
3616,2020-12-08 22:50:39,k9d3mb,"Good to know there is an age limit on pain. Who would have thought? Did they say what age was appropriate for pain? 18? 21? Dead? Only that last one sounds close. Your doctor is a boob. Unfortunately, youre a minor so they dont have to care. Any chance at dragging one of your folks to an appointment to act as an advocate that can do something? 

This is just a suggestion, try sitting down and writing this doctor a memo not just about what a stupid statement it is to ignore your pain due to age, but also about what you're feeling and how they are failing you. Then ask your folks to read it and see if you can get their help in presenting it to your doctor. It helps just to get it down in writing, but its also got a purpose behind it...."
3617,2020-12-09 05:59:46,k9d3mb,"Have you had an MRI? If not I’d suggest trying to push for one, that’s where we found the source of my back pain. I’m 19 with two herniated discs, one of which I already had an emergency surgery to fix but it just reherniated. I can totally relate to the “wow you’re way to young for this!” and I never know what to say because it’s like ... clearly I’m not too young for it if I’m experiencing it!! Wishing you luck in finding some sort of pain management!"
3618,2020-12-10 02:49:04,k9d3mb,I think you’d do better seeing an orthopedic surgeon or a neurosurgeon. It sounds like a back issue and your current doc isn’t doing anything. The best advice I can give is see the best doctor you can with your insurance (I wouldn’t go out of network). A good doctor is so important.
3619,2020-12-12 07:11:49,k9d3mb,"Definitely get an MRI if you can. Also, look into this as a potential cause: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spondylolysis

It’s pretty late where I’m at as of writing and I need to get to bed, but please DM me if you have any questions"
3620,2020-12-09 07:42:04,k9d3mb,"I agree with many others that you really ought to push for an MRI scan. 

In the mean time, consider starting a pain diary jotting down anything that you can think of that could lead to the pain getting better or worse. For examples actions like bending, twisting or perhaps whats the pain like in the pool. I think if you take the information and also the diary with you to the appointments then the doctor can see how serious you are in solving this problem, and hopefully they'd take you more seriously too.

Take care."

3630,2020-12-08 09:43:58,k8yd2a,"I made a Glaminatrix order not long ago and I have slightly mixed feelings about the products. I ordered the Sandra Rose palette which I quite like, lucid which is gorgeous and sun down, which is probably one of the worst shadows I've used in a really long time (which was really annoying for  $16!) I'm not sure if mine was pressed strangely, but theres barely any pigment at all (even digging in) and mine absolutely is not a multi chrome, at most it has a very subtle pink shift and looks nothing like the swatch on the website. Its also already got hardpan because I've had to really dig into it to get the bare minimum to show up. It's strange because Lucid isn't like that all. So I'm keen to try more from them (especially the periwinkle shades) but I'm a bit nervous to spend my money in case they're similar to sundown :("

3647,2021-04-10 00:59:22,k8yd2a,I feel the same about sundown. No shift other than slightly pink. Have tried every trick to try to get it to work. Almost zero pigment. Really disappointed. I bought this based on the swatch on their site. Wish i hadn't.  Love all the other shadows and highlighters i have of theirs. Their perwinkle matte and shimmer are beautiful.

3652,2020-12-14 22:39:23,k8yd2a,"Have you tried using a different primer? Concealers tend to contain oils or ingredients that are a bit slippy that could interfere with drier formulas/pressed pigments in my experience making it harder to blend. Pretty sure Robert Welsh has a video on this and I agree with him! With pigments, I like to apply to smaller areas and blend gradually so with that, I haven’t noticed patchiness with Sitting Pretty."

3658,2020-12-08 11:43:56,k8yd2a,"Sorry to hear it didn’t work for you 😢 it’s so weird Sundown is listed as a Sparkle multichrome but their newer releases (Reef, Tide, Urchin, Deep Sea and Moss) which are also listed as Sparkle Multichromes are completely different textures! The latter are kinda what you expect from a pressed shadow (thin, pigmented and sparkly in this case) which is so different to the putty like texture I have in Sundown. I’ll have to see if ingredients are similar and their effect if I have the patience 😅 so if you were into blues, I would say it’s not a total bust for the sparkle multichrome formula!"
3659,2020-12-08 10:35:34,k8yd2a,"Yeah it's quite understandable, I think they're only a 1 or 2 person show iirc. In saying that, looking at your swatch and the website swatch, I kind of wonder if I was sent the wrong one, because it doesnt look like either of them. It has a very strong white base with a very subtle pink shift and its not super chunky like your swatch. Either way, kind of disappointing, but Lucid made up for it!
       
I'll be interested to see their new palette as well. Judging from their sneak peak on insta and their newer shade uluru, which seems to fit the theme of the photo, I have a feeling it might be quite warmed toned!"
3660,2020-12-08 12:08:13,k8yd2a,"Sorry you're right, I always forget the different between lavender/ lilac so just say ""light purple"" haha."
3661,2020-12-15 04:25:24,k8yd2a,Hm I’ve tried it with primer and just on my bare lid and I have the same problem. I’m going to check out that video! Thanks 😊
3662,2021-02-19 23:02:37,k8yd2a,"Oooohh, thanks ,can’t wait."
3663,2020-12-08 07:20:40,k8yd2a,"I placed my most recent order on 10/11 and received it on 30/11 as I had the sparkle multichromes which were a pre-order. For my older orders, they could take up to 6 weeks (during peak-COVID in Melbourne) but I’m pretty sure now they are averaging about 2 weeks within Australia...maybe sooner if you’re in QLD. I would say this is the norm or considered fast shipping for indie brands in general.

I think your paint pot would do fine for the mattes but for any of the foils and multichromes, I highly recommend Nyx Glitter Primer! It’s a bit tacky and ensures that metallic/foiled/sparkly finish! Around $9-$12 I think!"
3664,2020-12-08 10:48:42,k8yd2a,"I just want to mention that I did build up my swatch for Sundown (two swipes) and did have to pat down some of the mica particles to show the colour. But yeah, I did have chunks when I dug my finger in. I’ll also be interested to see others’ Sundown as well and see if they had a similar thing to us (super shock like formula, inconsistent pigment). Lighting is also another factor and I tried my best to get it with natural light 😅 but I’m so glad you like Lucid! That’s also on my next haul haha 😆 I honestly can’t wait for this next colour story and if it’s outback themed (judging from the windmill) I hope the shades they come up with can be as diverse as their current blue shades lineup!"
3665,2020-12-08 07:25:26,k8yd2a,"Ah fair enough! I’m in melbs so hopefully it’ll arrive soon!

Ok thanks for the rec! I’ll check it out 🥰

One more needy question though haha. I’m particularly interested in the Fluro iridescent shadows, but can’t quite determine if they are less opaque/just need more product/layers? Is the idea that they’re kind of a sheen on first layer/swatch but can be built up? (Hopefully that makes sense 🙈)"
3666,2020-12-08 11:42:00,k8yd2a,"Oh man, I'm jealous that was only 2 swipes! If I remember, I'll try and take a photo tomorrow. Mine is nothing like the super shock formula, its very dry sadly :( yeah it's super beautiful, which made sun down even more devastating imo 😂 I have a feeling it will be, which I think will be really nice, can't think of any Australian themed palettes! Their blues definitely look gorgeous!"
3667,2020-12-08 08:25:52,k8yd2a,"Haha its okay! Happy to answer ☺️ I would say the Fluoro iridescent are definitely less opaque and are meant more as inner corner or transformative shades meaning you can pat them over a blackened base/eyeshadow to get the coloured pigments to sparkle through. But yes, definitely more of a sheen and because of its translucency, can also be worn as a subtle colourful highlighter...weird I know 😅 I haven’t got Terra Moons or Clionadh in my collection (yet) but they also have iridescent colours which behave similarly with different sized mica particles"
3668,2020-12-08 11:47:15,k8yd2a,Yeah please message it to me! That’s so weird but I haven’t had my sundown for very long...so there’s a chance it could dry out too. Haha well at least there’s a positive in this! 😂 Glaminatrix is bleeding my bank dry but I’m okay with that 🤣🤣
3669,2020-12-08 09:16:43,k8yd2a,Ohh thank you for your explanation!! That makes sense. I put in another order about an hour ago (thanks to you bahaha) 🥰
3670,2020-12-08 09:18:09,k8yd2a,🤣🤣🤣 I hope you really enjoy them!! I would do the same if I saw swatches haha
3671,2020-12-06 21:50:32,k80vp3,"Since this is just hypothetical and the questions aren’t limited to just the murders, I would interview:

1. Dieter, to ask him what he saw and heard that night. And tell him he’s good boi.

2. Everyone who was at in the damn house in NC the day of Nutgate, including the kids, to see if I could get at least 2 stories to match.

3. All of the Thrive Huns. I’d ask them all to bring their bank statements for the past year. I would force them to create spreadsheets indicating incoming and outgoing $$ and show them the big fat negative they’re netting.

4. Hisham and everyone who worked at Dirty South at the time SW worked there to get to the bottom of the embezzlement rumors.

5. Jeanna Dietz, to find out what happened to cause all contact to cease between her and the Watts by 2018."
3672,2020-12-06 21:37:41,k80vp3,I love the questions you would ask NK. I felt like they went so easy on her during her interview. They let her control the entire thing and didn’t play good cop/bad cop with her. I really wish they would’ve asked her if she was jealous of SW and make her admit she looked at SWs Facebook quite often.
3673,2020-12-06 22:05:52,k80vp3,"These are great questions
All I would have asked, wished were asked, and more.

No doubt NK would have croaked out she wanted a lawyer. 

The question is, did they have enough probable cause to arrest her to put real pressure on her, if she lawyered up. 

With the Frederick ping, the unremembered 111-minute phone call shortly before the murders, the sneaking in and out of  Watts' house, and all the stalking searches, I think it's a close call."
3674,2020-12-06 21:57:44,k80vp3,"I would ask SW’s ex husband about her infertility claims. Since this is hypothetical, I would also ask her doctors what they thought about her many illnesses and medical history."
3675,2020-12-06 23:29:01,k80vp3,"CW for me, of course!

-What time did SW arrive home?
-Did you two speak at that time?
-Details of the morning conversation and ""emotional, we'll leave it at that"" won't fly, what did you say, what did she say? Exactly.
-Were voices raised by either of you? Tears?
-Were the kids awake when SW came home?
-Were they awake when the two of you talked?
-Why did you open SWs car door, bend down and check the floorboard instead of going in the house to see if they were there?
-What did you remove from her vehicle?
-Why didn't you call out for them when you first entered the home?
-What were you doing on the phone while Officer Coonrod was checking out the house with you and NA?
-Why are there bedsheets in the garbage?
- Where did the blue glove come from and who used it?
-Can I search the truck? Why not?
-Why don't you seem upset or worried about your wife and children being missing??

I'm sure there's more I'll think of, but that would be a start!"
3676,2020-12-07 04:30:55,k80vp3,"For CW: 

1. Was the house on the market already? Why would your father say it was? 

2. How did you circumvent the Vivant system?"
3677,2020-12-07 22:45:18,k80vp3,"I know this is hypothetical but when you say you wouldn't let NK leave until every box was checked is that even legal / possible? It was always my understanding the reason why they were being so damn tip toed around her was because she technically didn't even have to answer any questions and was technically there doing them a ""favor"" so I would assume the minute she started feeling interrogated or even judged she would have left and would have the right to do so unless she was being charged with a crime. I certainly do wish she would have to answer those questions you wrote though!!  They could have at least TRIED a little harder! Or even how about just NOT allowing NK to bring them off topic SO many times and keeping the focus on RELEVANT shit not CW macros! Ugh!"
3678,2020-12-06 21:25:53,k80vp3,[deleted]
3679,2020-12-08 07:21:51,k80vp3,"I'll play. I would interview NA and all her other Thrive friends. 

I'd ask why they got so concerned so quickly. How did she seem in Arizona? Did she seem emotionally stable? Has SW ever talked about hurting herself or the girls?

Could Shanann have taken the girls and left? Is there someone outside of Thrive that she could have gone to? Did she, perhaps, just need to just get away from Thrive?

Why did you lie to the officer on scene by saying that Shanann had diabetes? 

(Both while they're still missing and after)  Is there any reason to believe that the girls might be in danger with Shanann? Is there any reason to believe that she might harm the girls? 

Has SW ever mentioned being afraid of CW? Have you ever witnessed him be abusive towards her? Have you ever noticed unexplained bruising or other things that made you wonder if she was being abused?

Have you ever observed CW be harsh or overly punitive to the girls? Do you know if he uses corporal punishment? Is there anything that makes you think he might have been abusing the girls? Did they seem afraid of him?

Do you think that CW would hurt his family? Does he have a history of sneaky behavior or dishonesty? 

What do you think happened?

Is there anything else that you think we should know?"
3680,2020-12-06 23:02:17,k80vp3,">Dieter, to ask him what he saw and heard that night. And tell him he’s good boi.

Yes! Esp the question about that poor pupper. I feel so bad for him."
3681,2020-12-07 00:01:47,k80vp3,"All of those are great, but I am really curious about #4 and #5.  People from her past.  Would they confirm our impression of SW?  Was she always self-absorbed, insecure, materialistic, a hypochondriac?  And especially, what happened when they lived with the Dietzes for a year?  Jenna was a mandated reporter for child abuse.  Did she see anything suspicious in Shannan's behavior with the girls?  Is that what the falling out was about?  

What about the employees at Dirty South?  What was SW referring to when she said in a Facebook post that the best revenge was to live well?  What do they think was the reason for SW's abrupt departure from NC?  Did they like her?  Was she a good boss?  Was she having an affair with Hisham?

And most of all I want to know, how were they going to get out of the financial implosion that was descending on them that very month?  A court date that would have resulted in a significant judgment against them.  Foreclose proceedings about to start and no 401k to raid this time.  A maxed out credit card, so how were they going to pay for daycare that very day?  They literally had nowhere to turn.  What were they going to do???

So many questions that will never be answered."
3682,2020-12-06 21:53:14,k80vp3,"Excellent. 

I know it’s hypothetical, but these people you listed, with the exception of Dieter, should have been brought in. But that would mean they had to actually actively investigate. They had their target suspect and that meant they didn’t need to prepare for a trial. It all sounds so ridiculous to say it."
3683,2020-12-06 22:21:11,k80vp3,2 & 3. Yes! LOL
3684,2020-12-07 05:36:07,k80vp3,"The blue gloves are interesting. I wish they’d tested them for any chemical residue or dna. It’s interesting because in the video where he’s loading Shannan’s body, he’s wearing white gloves. Or at least they look white. They don’t appear to be latex but it’s hard to tell in the video. They just seem puffier than latex gloves. I wonder if those gloves were used in the commission of the crime or just clean up. It would have helped to determine if he had them on to strangle Shannan. That would remove the “we were talking” bs. If he knew it was “the last time he’d tuck his babies in, then there was no “talk”, imo. And if he wore a different pair of gloves, why switch?"
3685,2020-12-07 09:13:05,k80vp3,Yes and when did he really start sleeping in the basement? Was the trip to NC really a trial separation? Had they discussed separation at any point before the trip to NC and if so why? Why did he never feel connection to Nikko - the son he was hoping for? Did he ever really love his wife and kids? How resentful was he and why? Why does he talk about separation but almost never uses the word divorce - as in the official end? Did nk pressure him to leave the family? Did he find nk to be as greasy and slutty as she looked and acted? Did they end up having anal? Did they ever have unprotected sex? Did he realize her tits were fake? Did he find her voice annoying and mannish at any time?
3686,2020-12-06 21:26:48,k80vp3,This is a hypothetical exercise meant for my subs to have a little fun with. Can you please cease ruining it for everyone? Thanks. I appreciate it.
3687,2020-12-07 20:21:17,k80vp3,"Re Dieter -- I remember thinking the same thing about the dog in the Laci Peterson case (I believe his name was McKenzie, or something similar?), because neighbors supposedly saw Laci walking him the morning she disappeared.  I wonder what he would have had to say?"
3688,2020-12-07 00:59:19,k80vp3,How was she planning on paying for their daycare? Seriously?! She needed to be holding a gigantic garage sale that weekend- not flitting around Arizona playing “business woman.”
3689,2020-12-06 22:01:59,k80vp3,"Aww, thanks for the award ☺️This is my favorite sub, I love the vibes here."
3690,2020-12-07 09:05:28,k80vp3,I never saw gloves on him In the security camera footage
3691,2020-12-07 20:27:48,k80vp3,Yes I think that was his name. I felt so bad for him... running around with the leash on until someone put him in the yard.
3692,2020-12-07 01:03:07,k80vp3,And planning a trip to Aspen.  I just can’t fathom how she thought!
3693,2020-12-07 09:12:49,k80vp3,I did. I am sure I saw them. But I’ve watched those videos many times.
3694,2020-12-07 09:20:19,k80vp3,"Around 9:35-939 in between there. It’s very fast, he walks very fast. But if you can pause and screen cap, and zoom in, you’ll see them.

POV is off to such a strong start. 👏🏼

Didn’t know that MC will go to Paris if she stays single. 😮

My favorite part about the results? The memes-ish. 😂

Won’t be surprised if DLS surpasses HS or if they tie though. 🤭"
3698,2020-12-06 11:52:45,k7s0fg,"Wow, I didn't expect Lucifer to have such a downfall,I liked the scenes with him but Malbonte was really well written and versatile character and indeed his scenes were cinematic and pretty but I have to accept that their tweets were really hilarious.😂
I think Leo/Aslan is still a bit underrated, he's so sweet,protect and always helpful to MC.In my opinion,he deserved to be higher in the ranking. 

and I agree,POV really had a strong start,story's atmosphere was really so cool and entertaining.
I think this story will be more interesting and pleasant in the future!

I really had so much fun reading, thank you guys for your effort and sharing! 😊❤"
3699,2020-12-06 11:30:30,k7s0fg,"Omg i can't believe HS's popularity is in danger by DLS!!! 🤭

Also... i'm the captain now meme, amazing! Can we say... this is the fall of Lucifer? 😂😂😂

I'm sure Lucifer wants a recount. DO A RECOUNT!!! 

And come one people, we can do more for LOW and LOS. Please. 🥺

Those tweets were an amazing touch! I can't get enough of them."

3702,2020-12-06 13:49:21,k7s0fg,"Lucifer's downfall from top spot was shocking. I am one of those who felt something for Malbonte but no way he is going to replace Luci for me. 

DLS is definitely going to take the top spot after HS ends and LOW is not far behind. 

Mei getting her well deserved position. Kazu as always making everyone swoon with his actions. Good to see Satoshi getting some love.. His character is fun. 

POV is getting popular..giving competition already. 

Edward made it in top 10..yay!!! 
With Alex, it was other way around for me haha. We are just friends now or business partner according to him.  

As always.. Good read. Thankyou everyone who worked on it. 👏"

The shock at how far down Lucifer fell!!! i think alot of players were just exhausted with his rejection and Malbonte became so interesting once his backstory was further explained. Tides could easily turn in the next release.
3729,2020-12-06 14:17:05,k7s0fg,"So here is my theory....""Why do everyone tends to love Malbonte more than Lucifer?""...
Its all because Malbonte turns out to be the the Luci we all have imagined before romancing with him( A rough devil who is soft only with MC)....we have always imagined Malbonte as a monster but instead of a villain he turns out to be a victim and now we all wanted to heal him and see his softer side🤪
But this is not same with me I wanted to be with him because I love bont❤ specially after that unique and sweet kiss with him( that eyes cheeks nose and lip kiss😍) 
Absolutely love it"

3773,2020-12-06 09:01:45,k7q8bi,Keabu's pretty cool. I assume you will be playing Cyberpunk 2077?
3774,2020-12-06 08:48:13,k7q2k4,Cristina* and that’s probably someone just trolling because all cast members were credited this year if they used past footage soooo until she actually appears on the screen then take IMDb with a grain of salt ://
3775,2020-12-06 16:57:56,k7q2k4,"Wish I had more info on whether Sandra is even in the country or not. Background details on actors helps a ton which is why I was so sure it was gonna be TR and not chyler last week. Right now I don't feel like she'll make an appearance, at least not in the next couple episodes."
3776,2020-12-06 13:36:49,k7q2k4,IMDB lists Leave a Light On for the episode she was in 2020
3777,2020-12-06 15:14:14,k7q2k4,I saw a thing recently where she said she would not return https://youtu.be/bJgi_E-VuBQ
3778,2020-12-06 13:41:48,k7q2k4,I imagine her being at the hospital bed and telling Mer to wake up.
3779,2020-12-06 08:43:30,k7q2k4,Also on wikipedia season 17 she is listed as notable guests. So my hopes are super high right now and I will literally cry if she doesn't make an appearance 😭
3780,2020-12-08 18:56:47,k7q2k4,Yeah don't they still credit the actor even if it's old footage?
3781,2020-12-06 08:49:37,k7q2k4,I really hope it's real 😭 I mean so far it was right about George when I looked after the first episode was aired but who knows
3782,2020-12-06 08:44:39,k7q2k4,If all we get is a phone call or something...
3783,2020-12-08 20:13:51,k7q2k4,Yes I said that. But what I’m saying is people are getting excited because they see 2020 next to character names and are assuming that they are going to make a reappearance
3784,2020-12-06 08:50:49,k7q2k4,Yes it would be nice but also Sandra Oh has stated sooooooo many times and in countless interviews she has no intention of returning so it would be surprising if she does make an appearance this season
3785,2020-12-06 08:47:39,k7q2k4,I would be happy if we could even see her on a video call but seriously shes my favorite and ima be pissed if she doesnt make an appearance
3786,2020-12-06 08:53:00,k7q2k4,I hope she was saying that because she didn't want to ruin the suprise 😂😭
3787,2020-12-06 09:06:40,k7q2k4,"Yep, I take even the references to her! A video call would be more than enough, even though I am hanging for an actual appearance."
3788,2020-12-06 08:52:41,k7q2k4,"Yeah I agree with this, if love her to actually show but a video would be good enough for me."
3789,2020-12-05 19:33:34,k754y1,Please note that racist comments will be removed and result in a ban.
3790,2020-12-05 19:12:58,k754y1,I don't understand that overly curvy look that seems to be the standard of beauty for black women nowadays. I don't want to name names but it seems like the most popular black women on IG who are known for their bodies (big asses/titties) look stocky to me. It's not like I don't find that look attractive sometimes but it's not a body type I have ever desired so I don't understand why everyone is going under the knife to get these extreme hips and butts.
3791,2020-12-05 22:29:57,k754y1,"I’m East Asian, so this will refer pretty much exclusively to Korean beauty (this is what I’m familiar with):

-the pale white skin look doesn’t look that good on a lot of people

-however, the pale white skin look DOES look great on some people that I think would actually look “just pretty” without it (especially some of the kpop stars labelled “ideal”)

-it bothers me when people automatically assume certain features are “eurocentric”. Like, some asians do have small eyes with monolids and flat features and they shouldn’t have to change that to be considered beautiful bc some of them ARE SO ATTRACTIVE with those features. But some asians do have natural high noses, light skin, and double eyelids, and it doesn’t make them “white looking” or “eurocentric” or “beautiful because they fit the white beauty standard”.

-also i get annoyed at people calling someone who genuinely is of average attractiveness average when they have “non-eurocentric” features being considered racist/eurocentric. It’s like assuming that the only reason someone isn’t as attractive as a white celebrity is because they don’t have “white features”, when in reality it could just be that they’re of average attractiveness.

-also get annoyed at those considering someone that doesn’t have “eurocentric” features as less attractive than white people of the same attractiveness and not making an effort to figure out why that is

-controversial opinion, but east asians do look younger (generally) and have to put more work into looking “older” or “mature”. Also if you’re someone with a thin / no curve body type, you look the best in either oversized clothes or “sexy” or form fitting clothes. A lot of thin east asians can’t pull off the “pastel, youthful looking” while still looking mature the way other races can (although the pastel, youthful tends to look STUNNING if the goal is to look young)."
3792,2020-12-09 12:43:46,k754y1,"Black American women have had the highest measured self esteem in the US until the silicone booty + light skin woman  became popular. Not a fan of PS in general, but especially for Black women. Now we're hyper insecure like everybody else."
3793,2020-12-05 18:04:40,k754y1,I agree with everything except for beauty being undeniable. Colorism can heavily skew people’s opinions. I’ve heard  colorist men say women like Lupita or Naomi aren’t attractive...LMAO. These are the men that will go after a very below average woman and think she’s pretty just because of her skin color.
3794,2020-12-05 17:51:34,k754y1,"I agree with you on east Asians and non dark brown/black hair colors. I don't think it looks bad per se but it always looks ""done"". Like some black & brown women can pull off lighter hair colors while still looking ""natural"" (Beyonce for example looks great with blonde & light brown hair) but east Asians almost universally look better with black or dark brown.

Probably a super unpopular opinion but I don't think all POC look good with a tan. I have naturally fair skin and I honestly feel like I look way better in my light winter skintone than my summer tan. Not that I'm condoning skin lightening--it's terrible for you and there are many beautiful dark skinned women. But I do feel like those of us who are naturally lighter sometimes get backlash if we prefer to stay that way instead of getting tan."
3795,2020-12-05 16:01:16,k754y1,"I hate when people look at black girls who are beautiful and say they are considered beautiful because they have “Eurocentric “ features. I saw someone doing this to Anok Yai an African model and also [her](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/76/4e/a0/764ea0639c712e23ae9106bcb3599827.jpg). Neither of them looks white in ANY way!  It really gets on my nerves, it’s basically like saying you have to look white to be pretty"
3796,2020-12-09 18:19:18,k754y1,"I'm half Asian, and I think some Asian people have flater faces compared to other races. I'm not into that. Some white people have flatter faces too.  Some Asian people have a strong bone structure, and it looks great.  

I think most people in kpop look the same. They seem to get plastic surgery to fit only one mold. Even non Korean kpop stars get surgery. Seeing Lisa from black pink makes me sad. I'm part Thai, and she no longer looks Thai to me. 

I don't mind if someone gets double eyelid surgery. But it freaks me out when people get non medically necessary jaw surgery. It seems to be common in Korea."
3797,2020-12-08 11:20:21,k754y1,"The ""eurocentric features"" discourse is so stupid and false."
3798,2020-12-05 12:32:29,k754y1,"Most attractive ""eurocentric"" features are actually more commonly found in POC. Double eyelids are not eurocentric, 50% of asians have them naturally and those who get surgery want to look like *asian* people with double eyelids. The features that are attractive now are upturned cat eyes, big lips, high cheekbones and most europeans don't even have those. They just claim every attractive feature as eurocentric because it fits their narrative that white ppl are always more attractive.

Ofc some standards are still eurocentric like blonde hair and blue eyes but the majority actually aren't."
3799,2020-12-06 01:52:08,k754y1,"East asian girls look best with east asian makeup (specifically Chinese and Korean makeup), not American ABG makeup as ABG makeup is adapted from white and middle eastern makeup trends we simply don't have the bone structure or eyelid space to pull off (deep eye sockets, deep cheekbones)."

3801,2020-12-05 11:01:53,k754y1,"As an Indian, I feel like blond is an awful hair color on most Indian skin tones. It just doesn't feel right to me.  Obviously you do you, but it's a hard pass from me."
3802,2020-12-05 21:15:55,k754y1,"Iranians are famous for getting nosejobs, these tend to be eurocentric but I think it suits us as I think it brings out our other features more. Lots of iranians are still gorgeous without them tho.
I also feel like its really become irans own aesthetic (ofc stemmed from eurocentric standpoint) but the whole bleached hair & nosejob really doesnt feel european anymore to me"
3803,2020-12-05 13:28:04,k754y1,"i project what i hate on myself and it’s become my standard for what i find attractive on other people kinda?

i explained it weirdly. but for example i HATE my wide, bulbous nose. therefore i refuse to date anybody with a wide, bulbous nose. i struggle to get my hair right. so i refuse to date anybody with hair that isn’t nice (well-done, styles etc irrelevant of texture/colour). i struggle to find my personal style that flatters me so i won’t date somebody who dresses unflattering etc.

but at least i’m realistic in that i don’t plan on dating anybody until i fix all those insecurities anyhow. i study psych so i know projection is fairly common and oft subconscious as long as you aren’t using it in malevolent ways."
3804,2020-12-05 16:28:06,k754y1,"My guilty opinion is that monolids are ok as long as the eyes are big, if you have small and monolid eyes you are pretty much fucked unless you are one of those models who manage to look good even with small eyes"
3805,2021-03-16 23:44:01,k754y1,As a black women im so sick and tired of the majority of black women wearing wigs and weaves that don’t match our texture of hair. The fact that the majority of women in pop culture refuse to wear their natural hair out contributes a lot to the stereotype that we are bald headed and will produce a whole new generation of of young black girls that believe their hair is not beautiful in its natural state. Not to mention natural hair looks wayyyyy better of us since our features are a lot bigger.
3806,2020-12-05 18:14:46,k754y1,"The feline eye trend was not racist towards Asians. The trend was for postive canthal tilt not monolids. Of course not all Asians have monolids, but it is a defining feature among their race that gets made fun of."

3808,2020-12-08 11:19:49,k754y1,There are non stocky ones who are curvy/ petite....who still do well.
3809,2020-12-06 02:24:07,k754y1,"I think pale white skin pretty much only looks good if you have a neutral or cool undertone, and this goes for any race. If you're too on the warm side without having a darker skin tone to balance it out it photographs strangely imo."

3811,2021-02-21 10:08:06,k754y1,Wym by PS?
3812,2020-12-05 18:17:26,k754y1,Sad but true. Like a lot of black men will expect exceptional beauty from a black woman: she must have the perfect body and a pretty face. But a fair skinned woman can have an average face and body and she’s seen as more desirable/
3813,2020-12-09 18:30:05,k754y1,"I agree with you on the hair. I think as long as the roots are dark it looks good though. I'm biased though because I have dark brown roots and ruby red ends.

Also agree regarding tanning. I'm normally super pale. I don't feel like myself with a tan because I'm not used to seeing it in the mirror. Tanning is great for others, but not me."
3814,2020-12-06 06:43:10,k754y1,"smaller nose, full lips, big eyes, have ALWAYS been a world wide beauty standard for women! i dont understand this ""eurocentric"" shit.. an example of something poc do that is following eurocentric beauty standards is whitening their skin or something. small noses exist in all races, it's actually racist to assume anything else!😂 this girl looks african 100% even her nose is african its just small. so dumb"

3816,2020-12-06 06:00:40,k754y1,"AGREED x1000. My cousin told me i was “lucky to have a white nose” because it’s straight (still have a bulbous tip, so if a white person did have my nose they’d be told to get a nose job). My nose is from my ethnic heritage and comments like that gross me out because the implication is that if someone has a “good” feature, it has to be european because it’s impossible for poc to have “good” features."
3817,2020-12-05 18:20:06,k754y1,People thought the girl you linked was black fishing and some still do it’s ridiculous even tho she addressed that she was fully black multiple times.

3819,2020-12-05 12:46:13,k754y1,"oh lord thank you for posting this, drives me crazy. sometimes there will be a picture of a beautiful black woman going viral on twitter and if she doesn’t have south sudanese dark skin, 4c hair, and an extremely large and broad nose then people start saying that she’s only perceived as beautiful because of her “eurocentric” features. or people calling duckie thot a white girl dipped in chocolate because they can’t fathom that an unambiguously black woman is being praised as gorgeous, meanwhile every feature of hers is clearly common in the black community. its so damaging because it reinforces this idea that all beautiful features are eurocentric"
3820,2020-12-22 11:48:20,k754y1,"I'm new here, but this comment resonated with me so much so I had to comment lol. I totally a 100% agree. High cheekbones are more common among indigenous and east Asian ethnic groups. The angel skill thing is (as far as I've seen), more commonly found on black women. The big eyelids and arched high eyebrows are common south and west Asian features, and most poc have bigger or pouty-er lips than white people. The only thing I can think of that is considered attractive and is most commonly associated with white girls is the small, thin upturned nose."
3821,2020-12-05 17:19:26,k754y1,"I second this! It’s a blend of many different features. Also small upturned noses aren’t only a Eurocentric thing. It’s commonly seen in South Asians, East Africans, etc."
3822,2020-12-05 12:51:36,k754y1,Yeah people like “ethnic” features but only if they’re more moderate aka on white/ethnically ambiguous people. Unambiguously ethnic poc are not the main beneficiaries of these standards because white folks want to play build a bear with our features and have found a way to profit off of them. And as far as double eyelid surgery i feel like globalisation and western influence has definitely played a part in its rise in popularity over recent years and it’s dishonest to pretend it hasn’t. It’s not exactly wanting to look white but it’s also an expression of discomfort with a unique East Asian characteristic.
3823,2020-12-06 08:06:56,k754y1,"This is so true, I wish I knew this sooner! Now I’m having to reinvent my look."
3824,2020-12-05 17:10:10,k754y1,I know exactly what poster you're talking about. I go back and forth on this because truerateme IS racist and sexist. But the poster in question also seemed like she was way overestimating how attractive she actually is
3825,2020-12-05 19:46:50,k754y1,It’s probably a coping mechanism. I saw a tiktok recently of a girl saying everytime a guy swipes left on her on tinder she just automatically assumes he’s racist...
3826,2020-12-05 20:48:50,k754y1,"Hard agree. Looks tacky as hell, even if you are ""fair"". Dark ash brown looks much better, or even reds looks fantastic if you are fair enough to pull it off (like Hania Amir). Blonde looks good ONLY if you are born with blonde hair already like some Pathans and Kalash of Pakistan, not on anyone else. Momina Mustehsan looked TACKY as hell and was DRAGGED even though she is ""fair""."
3827,2020-12-05 11:14:54,k754y1,I personally agree with you. It is in vogue (especially in the North) right now but I find it brassy most of the time and I think natural dark hair is often most flattering.
3828,2020-12-05 19:29:31,k754y1,It just looks so tacky most of the time even if you have fair skin. The only Indian girl I have seen that pulls it off is [Lisa haydon ](https://images.app.goo.gl/GBC6bHUudVCbkk8x9)but she still looks better with dark hair.
3829,2020-12-05 16:53:31,k754y1,"I'll have to disagree with this because I'm Indian and have had multiple people tell me I look amazing as a blonde 😅 I actually wish it didn't look good on me because it's expensive af to keep up. 

I have very fair neutral skin though, which I feel like isn't a super common Indian skintone either."
3830,2020-12-05 13:01:18,k754y1,"See, I disagree. And I’ve seen this opinion float around on this sub a few times. I think it works well on paler skin tones and if you get a proper stylist who gives you an ashier blonde that’s well blended without it being brassy. Sure, dark hair may look nice on a lot of brown girls but at times black hair lacks dimension depending on the person’s features. Or in my case my natural black hair was too harsh on my skin tone. 

I know a few brown girls, including myself who rock the blonde balayage and get lots of compliments from men and women. 

A good celebrity example would be Deepika Padukone who looks a lot better with lighter hair with blonde highlights. Same with Priyanka Chopra. None of them went overboard on the blonde - they kept their dark roots and the color is nicely blended and brass free. 

But yeah, any brown girls on here who are thinking of getting blonde, don’t be discouraged by this opinion. If you have the features and skin tone for it, it works on a lot of Indian girls."
3831,2020-12-05 17:36:41,k754y1,"That's funny because I'm the opposite. The women I find the most beautiful are the ones who similar soft, neotenous features like me.

Maybe I'm just a narcissist lol"
3832,2020-12-05 18:54:45,k754y1,Woooooooow. This is exactly how I feel but never articulated because it sounds bad. I can't tell you how many times I've deleted dating apps and told myself that I won't date until I lose so-and-so pounds or get my skin clear or whatever because I was not matching with people I found attractive (because I'm painfully average) and I was too insecure to talk to the very few I did like. Yet I'm still shallow af. I think it's better to be aware of how you compare and level up than being mad at the world that you don't size up.
3833,2020-12-05 14:45:54,k754y1,"Saaame. I find myself very attracted to people with aquiline noses and sharp features, partially because I sometimes don't love my rounded ones. Like a subconscious ""what features I'd want to pass on to my kids"" thing, even though I might not even want to have them 😂 it's silly!"

Obviously Asians are not the only people with positive canthal tilts. But again, many Asian people felt triggered by the whole thing and its wrong for non-Asian people to dismiss that just because they don’t get it."
3836,2020-12-05 12:20:43,k754y1,"what do you see as “black features”? it’s weird because there are certain unconventional features that are commonly seen in white people and perceived as ugly (like thin lips), but nobody really labels them as “white features” if that makes sense. it feels like people have been conditioned to only remember the aspects of blackness that aren’t seen as conventionally attractive when they think of black features

full lips, smooth skin, wide hips, feminine figure, etc are all features commonly seen in black women and definitely lauded as ideal but for some reason aren’t what usually come to mind when people think of black features"

3843,2020-12-05 16:56:49,k754y1,"Which doesn't even make sense because white people aren't the only ethnicity with small, straight noses. They're pretty common among North Africans and somewhat among middle easterners & indians well."
3844,2020-12-08 15:11:56,k754y1,"tiny noses aren't European features...High nose bridges and narrow noses are associated with europeans.

Short nose bridges and wide noses are associated with Africans and Asians"

3847,2020-12-05 18:20:33,k754y1,Exactly East Africans are the ones who own the small ski slope noses but for some reason it’s associated with white people which doesn’t make sense since most white people don’t even have small noses. Anok Yai is East African that’s why her nose is like that so it’s got nothing to do with looking Eurocentric like you said.
3848,2020-12-05 15:28:44,k754y1,"People used to say the same thing about Lupita Nyong'o but in the same breath will complain that black people aren't a monolith. Honestly, this is a non-mixed, unambiguously dark skinned black African woman. Just admit the fact you just can't accept that she's beautiful because you're narrow minded and think that black people should only look one particular way.  That you need to justify why she's attractive and chalk it down to some imaginary ""eurocentric"" beauty standards. Nevermind that she comes from the most genetically diverse continent on the face of the planet.🙄"
3849,2020-12-05 16:00:21,k754y1,Right? You would think that by now people would have realized that not every POC looks like a racist caricature of their race. Their is such an immense variety within every race and a lot of fully african looking women are gorgeous as hell.
3850,2020-12-05 23:59:19,k754y1,"I’ve seen extremely dark African women with Afro hair and prominent cheekbones deemed having “Eurocentric” features on Twitter with literally no Eurocentric featured at all... Extremely confusing. 

A lot of the recent talk of “featurism” is really  people’s jealousy of other dark skin people being beautiful, and subconsciously wanting to still uphold white as being most attractive."
3851,2020-12-06 02:20:06,k754y1,"I don't think it's dishonest to ""pretend it hasn't"" because East Asian eyelids are fundamentally different from the eyelids of European people. Monolids can occur in people of other descents as well as long as they're not white. 

The crease in a European's eye occurs as they have very little fat padding and deep-set eyes so the crease that you see is actually just the end of their eye socket, near the orbital bone, so these creases are parallel to the eye. An East Asian eye crease (what Asians attempt to achieve with surgery) is connected to the lash line and is tapered rather than parallel. Since East Asian eyes have more fat padding in them and completely different bone structure, the European crease is fundamentally unachievable since its based on having deep-set eye sockets.

It's true that double eyelid surgery has gotten a lot more popular in recent years, but double eyelids have been an East Asian beauty standard for a very, very long time. I don't think that getting double eyelid surgery to have slightly different but still distinctly East Asian eyes counts as ""discomfort"" with one's racial characteristics. Also, a lot of people who get the surgery have hooded eyes (i.e. they already have Asian double eyelids but want to get rid of the hooding). It's not that straightforward. Tbh as someone who grew up in a majority East Asian country I've noticed that most of us have double eyelids. It's rarer to see monolids than it is to see natural double eyelids and I've observed this since I was a kid."

3854,2020-12-05 11:47:09,k754y1,This is one of the frustrations I have with kpop lol.

I understand it’s because they need to be recognisable but still.

3856,2020-12-05 13:30:33,k754y1,I feel like I should have specified. I'm talking about going full blond. Not blond mixed in with dark roots. Not a few shades lighter. Just full blond.
3857,2020-12-06 00:02:50,k754y1,"No, that’s healthy and natural honestly. To actively look for people who don’t look like you is typically not a good thing."
3858,2020-12-05 18:06:41,k754y1,"Same. The bodies I like the most tend to be similar to mine, but for me it’s extra strange since I’m bi and will be attracted to these women. Makes me feel like a narcissist"
3859,2020-12-05 18:56:21,k754y1,It's hard to say because most people like women that look like that.
3860,2020-12-05 21:37:05,k754y1,"I def agree with this too. My monolid eyes aren’t super tiny, but I have prominent cheekbones and was somehow born with Angelina Jolie size lips. Sometimes if I’m sick or sleep too much, my eyelid on just one eye doubles up, and that one eye looks so much bigger than the other. If only I could get both eyelids to double up consistently, my whole face would have better harmony.

The biggest problem with monolid eyes is there’s nowhere to put makeup on them. Even small double-lidded eyes can look big with makeup, but not having a crease to put makeup in is a major disadvantage. 

So these are the only reasons why I’m considering eyelid surgery. Not because I want to look white, or because I want Eurocentric features (my dad has double-lidded eyes), but because I want this one feature to look bigger. Plus as you age, monolids droop more and can start to interfere with your vision. It’s starting to happen to my mom. Whereas my dad doesn’t have that issue."
3861,2020-12-05 21:42:23,k754y1,"Exactly. For decades, having narrow tilted eyes was a negative thing associated with Asians being untrustworthy, yellow peril and all that. Suddenly white girls were pulling their eyes up and back to look more “exotic”... that doesn’t erase all the history where Asian people were mocked by white people making that exact same gesture in a malicious way."

Unfortunately a lot of societies factor a woman’s perceived “purity” into her attractiveness
and since light skin has historically been considered “pure” and dark skin “dirty”, black women seem to have to work twice as hard to compete in conventional beauty spaces."

What an ugly mentality my goodness. The fact that they know they can compete in the black community makes it even uglier. I never knew this was a thing tbh because 99.9% of the South Asians I grew up in London with wouldn't be caught dead claiming or pretending to be part black. 

Anyway I've found that the vast majority of mixed black+South Asian just look black because of the \~dominant\~ black genetics.

And I've seen her pics on vindicta, she's just a regular Indian girl. It's funny because actual Afro-Indians are not only a minority in India but are also extremely marginalised in society (they regularly face horrific racism). But you know something, in spite of all the shit they go through they are **extremely** **proud** of their African ancestry, **to the point that they have even retained some of their language, customs and cultural practices from the African countries where their ancestors came from.** That's what leads me to believe that she's lying about being mixed.

Also, I've spent enough time around mixed Indian + Afro Caribbean and mixed Indian + African people and they face a lot of racism too especially from the Indian sides of their families. The person who marries black is often ostracised and sometimes completely disowned.

Sorry to say but the anti-blackness really does run deep within South Asian communities, I have also experienced it firsthand.

John and Candice were last minute replacements in Blood vs Water. The returning players all had pregame alliances that Candice wasn't in any of. That's why she was out instantly. 

Yes, Kim is a Queen. 

Nobody knew who Malcolm was in Caramoan or who Russell was in HvV. There was only about 2 weeks in real life between those seasons and Samoa/Philippines. Malcolm was essentially a Fan himself so it might explain part of why he worked with the guys more.

Interesting point about the seasons being so close together. I did notice that when looking over the Wikipedia pages for the seasons but I didn't process how it impacts the game especially because they were such dynamic players in their seasons.

My friend did warn me about the auctions earlier when I told him I loved them and wondered why they weren't in 39 or 40 and now it makes sense. It's a shame they can't figure out a workaround for survivors teaming up during them because I did enjoy the auction a lot.

All-Stars knew who Rupert was but not how he finished on Pearl Islands it hadn't finished airing on TV at the time. They also asked Sandra for All Stars but she was recovering from parasites she got in PI at the time. 

Russell got away with a lot in HvV because people didn't know him and he had a few ways to use production to his advantage as well. 

Apparently the OW men went to Tribal voluntarily after Bill threw Colton's Idol into the ocean. Production fished it out and returned it to Colton but they weren't allowed to talk about it on camera. 

Micronesia had only seen  part of China. James was already popular, Amanda was a surprise as she hadn't done much in the part of China that had aired at the time. 

There's 2 people from S33 who went straight to S34. You've seen S33 from the looks of the old post. They apparently asked David but he said no. 

They asked Malcolm again for BvW but he said no to doing 3 back to back seasons. 

They really wanted Kat for BvW. Hayden the winner of a Big Brother season was her 3rd choice. It's commonly mistakenly believed they wanted Hayden and not Kat. Apparently Kat'sluxury item was a photo of her with Kim and a letter from Kim."

It's more of a rhetorical question because I liked the auction so much I want them to do what they need to to bring it back lol

Last question, what did Russell do to use production to his advantage in HvV?

I did read the thing about Colton's idol and the list of people asked to come on for BvW 2 but couldn't because of their loved ones not being cleared so it's interesting to see how it impacted Kat and her first two choices not working out to bring Hayden on.

One last point, I do know they bring Zeke back for 34 because of the Varner fiasco but I'm excited to see who else comes on because I loved that cast!"

He'd play ""hot or cold"" with the camera crew. During Idol searches he'd randomly start sprinting in one direction and could tell by how much effort the crew put into chasing him if he was going in the right direction towards an Idol or not. 

Once he knew it was close by, he'd also randomly look back right at the camera to see if they were pointing at the Idol to make him look dumb for not seeing it in the TV edit. 

At some point Russell ""goes for a walk"" in HvV I believe and everyone else looks stupid for letting him go and even wonder if he's really just walking. He's obviously Idol hunting. What the show doesn't tell you is that ""walks"" mean something else. They are monitored by like a dozen crew members at all times at camp. If they want you to go film a confessional they'll signal you and you must announce to everyone ""I'm going for a walk"" which is code they all know means production wants a confessional so they don't true and folllow the person etc. They let Russell walk off because they thought production wanted him. I think they added a rule later that you couldn't do this, so people in the show now call Idol hunting ""hikes in the jungle.""

You've seen WAW it says in the other post. Before the Sandra boot when Tony was hiding out and nobody could find him; we saw Kim ask if he ""went for a walk."""
3906,2020-12-04 17:41:08,k6oemo,"My hope is that Mer recovers ( >!I think Koracick or baileys mom will die if not both)!< and this is a wake up call for Mer who decides to retire early and spend more time with her kids. The hospital continues on , etc."

Bailey just started his residency in plastics being taught by Jackson. Ellis has taken up writing and has been writing this series the whole time!"
3911,2020-12-04 16:45:08,k6oemo,"I believe this is the last season! But, if they kill Meredith off with Covid I will be pissed. I just want some satisfaction, considering how downhill the show has gone since Shknda left"

It's almost like an idealized version of what a shared superhero universe could look like with a consistent vision and without editorial stumbles."
3918,2020-12-03 03:15:57,k5o8ub,"Well, DCeased Hope at World's End, Suicide Squad, and Metal Men just finished up.   


Only a few more issues to go for Strange Adventures and DCeased Dead Planet too, so I'm kind of at a loss for what to read for ongoings.  


I'm almost considering picking up Legion of Superheroes and Death Metal (Dropped both after issue 2 because they were lackluster but hopefully they've picked up by now).   


Other than that, I'm trying to collect back issues of any Teen Titans/Titans/Young Justice/Legion of Superheroes/JLA/Green Arrow books.

On deck are Uncanny X-Men Omni 2 and Geoff Johns’s JSA run."
3920,2020-12-03 07:29:41,k5o8ub,"I recently finished the *Superman: The Man of Steel by John Byrne* hardcover and absolutely loved it. I'm a big fan of late 80s/early 90s artwork and the way these stories were structured: individual, mostly standalone issues that contribute to a larger story arc, instead of how it's often done today (one long story drawn out over ~6 issues). Also, that moment where Lex Luthor >!does not want to recognize the computer result that Superman's secret identity is just a boring newspaper reporter!< is peak comicbook goofiness. Love it. 

Looking forward to Vol. 2 which should get released in January, I believe."

3926,2020-12-04 08:44:56,k5o8ub,"I read *You Brought Me The Ocean*. For the most part I thought it was good, but I feel like the ending fell flat: the story seemed to set up that Black Manta would be involved in the climax but he never showed up, and the only actual bad guys that show up in the story are some fairly mundane school bullies. Granted, that's the sort of low-level-but-personal stakes that fits with the story up to that point – but Black Manta's importance in the backstory makes it seem like things are going to escalate and then they just *don't*. The story would've been stronger if it just hadn't tried to make Jake an alternate version of Jackson Hyde at all – he's basically an original character already and even has a different first name, and they could've just said that his father was some random Atlantean instead."

3931,2020-12-04 00:50:27,k5o8ub,"Honestly, Death and Return of Superman so far has been sort of lackluster for me. I know it's an iconic story and that was the reason I bought the book, but actually reading it was different than what I initially thought. The battle against Doomsday himself was not as grand of a battle as I thought it would be. Maybe this can be better appreciated for the time it was written in. I'm not an avid reader of early 90's and before as the thought bubbles and dialogue can throw me off a bit.

I'm just skimming through funeral for a friend right now and hoping Reign of the Supermen will pick up. I'm confused as to why Lex and Supergirl (idk if that's actually Supergirl) are a couple.

I'm glad I'm reading this though. It would be a wasted opportunity to not know probably the most iconic Superman story."

This is extremely stupid and I am aware of how first world and childish this whole thing is. However, here is the problem that has caused a huge divide among the people in my social group/work.

I acquired a Mexican Baja Hoodie from a friend. It is warm as fuck. It is also the colors we are required to wear to work. We don't have a uniform and we aren't customer facing half the time but those are the rules. So I talked to my manager, got their approval, and have been wearing it for about two months now. 

One of my co-workers already doesn't like me very much. Sandra has small dick energy with big dick aspirations. She is always criticizing people for how they dress (*too casual*) or how they talk (*too casual)*. She hates that my hair is short, that I don't wear make-up, and now hates that I look like a preteen boy. She has made comments about how I should at least wear nicer shoes. 

She does this to everyone, she isn't just targeting me. But she made a comment the other day, about how I was wearing a druggie hoodie to work and I shouldn't. I laughed it off. 

But she kept making little comments about it, until I got sick of it and asked her to stop. The whole conversation was stupid, but she ultimately said that it looked tacky, only weed smokers wear those hoodies, and it looked unprofessional. 

She told me, ""We used to call them drug rugs in high school. No one who had one did anything with their life."" 

I told her I don't smoke pot, I liked the hoodie, and it was a Mexican Baja hoodie not a ""drug rug."" And also that we had the same job, so obviously we are doing something with our lives. 

She got this look on her face and said, ""Oh, that's a typical response from someone stealing from another culture."" 

I told her, ""If you are implying I am doing something wrong, then maybe we should call you racist for having two chihuahuas named Taco and Burrito. That seems like a real issue. Want to talk about that? See, that's how silly you sound turning my sweatshirt into a political problem. It's not, leave me alone."" 

She complained to the rest of the floor and we had to talk to the manager. He said that we need to drop the sweatshirt topic, while looking  at Sandra. Then we went back to work, but at that point people were either joking around, saying they didn't want to be ""cancelled"" for naming their dog Chalupa or they seemed annoyed I engaged with her/called her racist. 

So, AITA?

3954,2020-12-02 08:09:13,k547w0,"NTA- it is clear you used her dogs names as a comparison of her own mentality, and that it is t actually the way you think. Man oh man is it frustrating to see that childish dilemmas like this don’t always stop after high school!"
3955,2020-12-02 09:05:43,k547w0,"NTA the way I see it, you're not calling her a racist. But if you are appropriating a culture for having a shirt, she is a racist for naming her dog burrito and stereotyping Mexican culture.

Also, thank you for introducing me to this type of sweater. I've never seen it before."
3956,2020-12-02 11:52:48,k547w0,NTA. Sandra just seems like a handful and looking to cause trouble for no reason.

Obviously your manager agrees with you, so ignore and stay toasty. (Not toasted lol unless you feel like it!)"

I was trying to point out that people can take something stupid and non-sensical (like her dog names) and make it an issue.

I really just want her to leave me alone. I don't have work to do with her. I don't live near her. I really don't even have a desk near her. But she is always walking around the place like she owns the world and it just got to me today."

I've never worn one, and I've never cared what they're called. Sorta like how undershirts are called ""wife beaters"". It's all tacky as hell, but we've really gone off the deep end as a society if we're this obsessed with PC culture."
3966,2020-12-02 06:58:49,k547w0,"I think there are some things I would be an asshole to wear around (like a feather headdress or religious robes).

In a Vanguard award interview, Sandra mentioned some of it. They like the idea of not spoonfeeding the audience everything, rather, there’re clues everywhere, allowing us to put two and two together ourselves. 
Whether Eve wears her hair up or down in any given scene, is one of the ‘clues’ about Eve’s state throughout the show. Quite fascinating really."

4049,2020-11-28 11:06:12,k2d2b4,"Sandra Oh is legit one of the most inspiring actress in the biz. She's engaged in everything she does and made her way through Hollywood by knowing what she wanted and mostly didn't want. 
Those interviews where she talks about knowing your worth and learning to be genuinely be willing to walk away from something that isn't good enough for you, despite how hard you want them, are in my eyes so important, especially since it's applicable everywhere, not just in Hollywood.
Also heard she's been calling out the lack of diversity in KE, in the show as well as in the team behind it.

4052,2020-11-28 16:35:16,k2d2b4,"If it's possible to be in a business for over 30 years and still be underrated, then Sandra Oh is.   She shouldn't have had to wait as long as she did to get a plum role like that of Eve Polastri in *Killing Eve*, but she did.   Yet you don't ever get any notion that her experiences have made her feel bitter or entitled.   She is a working actor, not a superstar.  And I think she likes it that way.  


Everything she does isn't great,  but she's *never* the worst thing about it.   She doesn't have ""the look"" and she knows it.   No need to get political, but let's just say some looks are easier to sell and cast in television and film than others.  That's not Sandra's problem.   Give her the chance and she will shine.  Not all the time, but enough of the time to make it clear she is a force of nature.

(not real names)
  I’ve been dating my boyfriend, Nick, for 2 years now and I’m very close with his brother Barry. Barry started dating my friend Sandra about 7 months ago. Sandra and I got along fine when we didn’t see eachother 3 days a week when we all hung out together but she’s just unbearable now. 
  Sandra likes to constantly compare our mental traumas, religious experiences, relationships, and literally everything I open up about. I was raised intensely Catholic while she was raised nondenominational Christian. I’ve struggled a lot with my religion because I’ve basically been born into it and have been pressured into receiving sacraments that I didn’t even believe in. She likes to compare and act like my experiences arent as bad as her being “forced to go to church once a month”. 
  Sandra also compares my relationship to her’s and constantly says “that’s why me and Barry are a better couple” unironically. 
  We all sat down together to talk about these things and how I was so incredibly hurt by her saying my relationship isn’t as good as her’s and she didn’t even apologize once. She made excuses and said “oh well I didn’t WANT to do/say that but Barry said he thought I should”. 
  After that, we stopped hanging out together and I distanced myself. A few months later, we got into a huge argument because she said people who don’t support her political opinions deserve to go to hell and obviously I completely disagreed. I told her it’s completely toxic to think that way, no matter what their political opinions are and she started full blown yelling at me calling me stupid and saying “what aren’t you getting”. Never apologized. I confronted her a few hours later and said I can’t tolerate being friends if she’s going to treat me like that for a disagreement. You know what she said? She said “oh yeah I was planning on apologizing but forgot”. 
  Now, Barry is almost constantly complaining about Sandra’s toxic behavior and says he’s afraid to talk to her about it because she starts crying and has a panic attack thinking that Barry hates her now. Not to mention, Sandra is putting a suspicious amount of effort to talk/hang out with Barry’s best friend Nathan. I’ve told Barry before that this isn’t healthy but it’s like he’s completely blind to his manipulation. Am I wrong for hating his girlfriend? Would I be an asshole for wanting them to break up?

4066,2020-11-26 06:17:20,k19rz5,"NTA you are soooo not wrong for hating her. I would be super careful about talking about how you feel about her though. Don't tell Barry you hate her. Next time Barry approaches you guys: listen to him, and validate his concerns. Offer to help figure out a way to talk to Sandra, but don't run a campaign against her or suggest a breakup. That's only going to add tension and drama and he won't feel comfortable confiding in you guys further. Let a breakup be HIS idea."

If Barry complains to you about his partner than you should just tell him to dump her and not let her guilt him into staying, but other than that - move on with your life and stop engaging with her. NTA."
4069,2020-11-26 06:30:47,k19rz5,Don’t discuss sensitive issues with her or when she is around.  When she tries to one up you just ignore her & change the subject.

I'm sure she'll blame you for having an opinion, but that's her problem. Wouldn't be an issue if she didn't spend half her time treating you like shit. 

Remind your friend that the way she reacts when he approaches her about her behavior is an abuse tactic. It allows her to victimize herself, shields her from valid critique and only serves to make the wronged party feel guilty for calling out her harmful actions, which means she gets to continue treating people like crap without repercussion. Blow off any guilt you feel OP. You dont deserve it."

I hope your players don't bristle at that.

I'd cyberpunk it up, have them all be connected to some corpo's Dev network where he experiments on kidnapped Street rats and the like in a weird shared virtual reality for their consciousnesses. It's effectively the story of The Matrix Reloaded, what with the architect revealing that it's the end of just one of an iteration of a cycle of Matrices."
4148,2020-11-23 15:17:42,jyuac1,"I'd personally hate to be told ""it was all a dream"" but if your players are fine with it, fair enough.

That said, I like Jace's take on making it a shared VR experience or perhaps a Braindance ""movie"" of their previous adventures; they happened, but the ""movie version"" (what you all played) was reedited and changed some details.

Or what if you just start playing but the players start wondering why the world of ""now"" doesn't quite fit their previous setting or actions (somebody remembers a past adventure differently, etc)... gradually reveal their memories have been tampered with so what they remember might not have happened the way they think."
4149,2020-11-23 15:23:12,jyuac1,"I don't know, maybe this is just cuz I have an easy going set of players but I basically told them ""Hey, with the full rules and knowledge now, things are gonna be changed a little bit. I'll try and notify you of any big changes that would effect your characters decisions but let me know immediately if your expectations of the world don't line up with mine and it leads to a decision you want to change/modify."" One character is switching roles, another has had her nomad family moved around a bit, the neighborhood where they live has been changed. Works for us"
4150,2020-12-27 17:39:30,jyuac1,"This seems like a way to go. What I have a hard time to understand is how the skills and abilities change from jumpstart to core book and if we need to tweak anything. Is there a simple guide of what one need to do to just continue with characters from the jumpstart book? Also what level are the pre-gens in the jumpstart book?

&#x200B;

I am in the mindset of just letting the players flesh out their characters more after the current mission we are playing (The Apartment, which I renamed as The Inheritance and threw in some interesting stuff in there) and choosing roles according to the chars they have now: a rockerboy, a netrunner, a nomad and a Techie (more in the tech side than medical side). When I started I did not have the core rulebook and so I just went rewarding the chars with reputation instead of IP....but that would change once we are done with the last session. 

&#x200B;

Any tips as to figuring it out would be highly appreciated."
4151,2020-12-31 11:55:22,jyuac1,"It’s pretty difficult to just translate characters from the Jumpstart Kit to the full rules.  For instance, the Jumpstart Kit templates have stats going up to 10, while the ones made with the full ruleset max out at 8.

My advice would be to take the characters in your campaign, and then use the Street Rat rules to build characters of the same Role.  You’ll get templated characters that translate pretty well.

As for the question of what level they are: Cyberpunk doesn’t have the concept of “level” per se, but if you’re asking about the Role Ability, the only character in the Jumpstart Kit who has a Role Ability is Redeye; hers was 7.  That’s pretty heavy, and generally PCs start off with a Role Ability of 4."
4152,2020-12-31 13:52:32,jyuac1,Thank you. You made it very clear. I will be doing a session zero after the scenario is finished and players will do a re-role.

4167,2020-12-30 19:52:01,kmvi5k,"Cristina in the 2nd ep was the one that dubbed him “McDreamy” ...

I can see some people thinking that’s “dreamy”... or maybe it’s just comparative to everyone else they were around most of the time (obviously not the main cast but the pretend environment of the hospital)

Like Cristina said: 
“Oh please, you have a hot doctor who likes to make you open up and say “ahhh”, it’s the American dream”

I don’t know about y’all but sometimes a person who wouldn’t be *typically* categorized as “attractive” or “dreamy” becomes so because of personality factors like intelligence, kindness, wit, humour, and/or power.

I’m not saying the title fits - but I known ppl who

'Midnight Caller' is the first in a series, following two paranormal detectives from Floor Fifty-Four as they solve strange and dangerous cases.

Yesterday I was randomly watching some random movie. it flipped on james bonds tomorrow never dies from 1997. 

So watchin that cringe bullcrap from 97 and suddenly noticed Michelle Yeohs role as a spy. How was she portrayed. As a sexy spyish catwoman type who dresses up in full black leather complete with high heels and a belt while she infiltrates some secret lab...

4195,2020-12-28 13:29:48,kld2dg,"Full Asian men are in a very difficult situation when it comes to this issue.

If they decide to voice how they feel, a lot of non-Asian men and Asian women will interrupt and I would argue that in some cases maliciously describe these worries as nothing more than insecurity of having to compete for Asian women. These malicious detractors are trying to frame this issue about Asian women, when in reality it's about the emasculation of Asian men in Western Society. I always find it strange that this conversation always ends up being about Asian women and rarely do they focus on Asian men. 

Then if you decide to bring up  serious issues among Hapas you will get label a racist and immediately will be chastised and permanently vilified as some type of nationalist. 

It seems to me that Hapa males are the best situated to talk about this issue publicly instead of full Asian men. Since if Full Asian men speaks about this issue he will just be labeled as salty control freak that is worried about Asian women leaving them, unfairly, and a racist. They can't use these malicious tactics against Hapa men. 

Only problem is that Hapa dudes will never admit this publicly,at least above average one's in appearance,  since they are too prideful and have big ego's, and the one's that are vocal about this are usually the ones that hate their Asian moms, so they develop this anti=women rhetoric. Which will not be helpful when wanting to discuss this issue publicly. Also if we get some Ugly ass dude they are just gonna focus on him individually."

4198,2020-12-26 09:17:50,kkfqh1,"therapist! pretty much your only option here. this is going to sound harsh, but you don’t have any proof, so it’s just “he said she said” right? so stay away from this creep and see a therapist."
4199,2020-12-26 09:40:36,kkfqh1,"First of all, you need to talk to someone about all this, someone who can help you clarify the memories, and help you deal with the effects. Take care of yourself first, make sure you're ok, before taking any next step. You do need to be careful though, because it can be very difficult to determine how genuine the memories are; what comes out can be interpreted in different ways, and people often let their own issues affect how things are interpreted. For example, based on one details, the therapist can start asking leading questions which your mind, lacking any additional information, may use to try and fill in the blanks, altering the story. I mention this because, if you do decide you want to try and have something done from a legal perspective, her lawyers will microscopically examine the story and everything about your from then until now, trying to find something that may explain the memories in another way.

Secondly, it isn't surprising that the memories are so vague. Apart from the fact the first years of childhood tend to be that way, unless there was a particularly significant event, it would be rare for someone to hold onto to memories from around that age. Kids simply live too much in the moment for all the details to settle in long term memory; once something has been experienced, they move onto the next, then the next. It takes something really special or tragic, something that has a lasting effect on their life, for a child to remember much. This is likely why the memory is so vague. You say you were more confused by what happened, and being a totally new experience outside anything you had seen or heard before, your mind would have have trouble locking on to the memory for the long term. It could also be a defensive mechanism, ie you were affected more than you think but, not having the emotional tools to deal with the act, your mind decided to pretend it didn't happen so you could move on with your life.

In the end, it will come down to two things; how clearly the memories can be recalled, and how determined you are prevent it happening to any other child. Work with someone qualified, see if you can be absolutely certain about what you remember, then take it from there. Try to not worry about the ""what's next"" aspect of things while trying to remember, as the additional stress will make it harder for the fact to come to light. And facts are what you are going to need, if you do decide to pursue this further. Good luck, I hope you find the peace you seek."

4204,2020-12-26 10:17:23,kkfldu,I think if you genuinely remember these vivid memories then you have repressed the abuse you received. She acted like she didn’t know you because that’s what abusers do. Either they seriously dont think they were in the wrong or they play it off as nothing happened knowing damn well what they did. I would ask your mom about how often you would hang out with them as a kid to confirm your suspicion of this abuse.

4214,2020-12-26 21:27:57,kk79sh,">**Derek** \- **W O W**. This is the McDreamy everyone's still pining for? I mean, sure, he did grow as a person as the show went on and actually became kinda sorta tolerable. But my god is he terrible for quite a while here. You move to the other side of the country because your wife cheated on you, alright, cool. But that you don't even *think* about signing divorce papers before jumping into bed with another girl you find in a bar? **Then** you basically stalk her, kind of even harass her and act like a complete Chad to get her to go out with you.
>
>You lie until Addison exposes you and you act like it was a simple whoopsie. You're so confident that you like, even love, Meredith, that you say you **will** sign divorce papers because you hate Addison so much. Then you scold Meredith over asking you to make a decision that you should have done a long time ago and the consequences of which you should have thought of before you fucked her. Asking her to give you sympathy is the last thing you should be doing, because you put yourself in this situation. And after pining for Meredith for so long, YOU DON'T FUCKING CHOOSE HER?! Jesus H Christ dude, it's insane how full of himself Derek really is. Not to mention that he straight up called her a whore, because she had the audacity to try and move on.
>
>Then there's the whole Rose situation, which was absolutely and utterly pointless. And then he just continued to gaslight Meredith. She came up with the idea for the clinical trial. She did the research. She did the brunt of the work and you don't include her in your article? Fuck you man. And of course he doesn't see any problem with that, because Meredith is simply a resident. Goddamn this man. But of course he ""makes up for it"" by gifting her a kidney in a jar. Sure the thing is cool, but that's how easily he gets off?
>
>I'm glad he grows as a person, but he never really loses that ego and narcissism, especially towards Meredith. Yes, you were a great couple together at times, but my god is Meredith a far more interesting person without you.

Saaaaameeee. Also while on rewatch I realized the kiss with Rose happened while him and Meredith were still a kind of thing and he didn't tell her until George did by accident, then with Rose who was very open with him this dude lets her believe they are actually going somewhere when he is pretty much just using her as rebound/placeholder and of course he had the nerve to be all self-righteous about her not taking their break-up well.

>I know I know, it's the essence of their relationship and the show needs their drama, but viewing all this again, it's baffling how unhealthy their relationship is most of the time. They're always pitted against each other and yes, Derek isn't always in the wrong, but he is more than Meredith. At least Meredith gets actually interesting plotlines and makes decisions that, while not always morally right, give the character much needed depth. Like the arc with the serial killer.

My thoughts exactly, she fucked up plenty but jeeez, Derek was something else in their relationship and it never helped that his storyline was basically Merder and being McDreamy."

This is all I came for lmao. you are CORRECT. 

I agree with almost everything but especially about Hahn. She was prickly, sure, but she wasn't wrong. At the time of her employment, the hospital was being run like a game but, had they kept her, I think she would have softened up around the edges and eventually gotten Grey Sloan crazy like all the characters eventually do. A few seasons in, and she would have probably done an emergency surgery in the cafeteria lmao."

4224,2020-12-26 13:25:18,kk79sh,"Hahahaha, I think almost everyone has done surgery in insanely unorthodox places by now.

Hahn was clearly meant to be a foil to Yang, Bailey and male doctors.

Not to mention, she had over 20 years in the industry and she never spoke about Asian issues until recently. When Parasite won oscars earlier this year and she got up and started clapping and talking about how she's so proud of being Korean.... I cringed.

4236,2020-12-23 18:57:18,kilhf5,I get what you’re saying but is that how desperate the Asian community is?  We’re hurting so bad for voices that we need to welcome phonies like this?

4239,2020-12-23 16:35:39,kilhf5,"Yeah but it’s a nice gesture, maybe it is a desperate attempt at showing her care for Asian issues. And every other interview she does, probably most, she does mention something about being Asian like on SNL she said something like “it’s hard to accept complements because I’m Canadian, etc” followed by “I’m also Asian and being Asian means I deflect praise.” 

She also talked about how she was one of the few Asian kids growing up in Ontario, which is relatable to a lot of us, while not necessarily something amazingly interesting but relatable."
4240,2020-12-23 21:12:23,kilhf5,A majority of Asians in western countries actually live in coastal metropolitan cities with dense populations of asians. The token Asian in a white community is actually rare and not a representative of a lot of Asians’ experiences in the west.

SF, LA(LA county), Orange County, NY, Houston, Seattle."

Do you have a survey or data where it shows it is not relatable to many? Dude have you ever been to towns or places with few Asian people or no Asian supermarkets? You sound sheltered yourself.

4255,2020-12-22 21:08:29,kidzud,"the way i already see aminata being in the top 3, diva being in the bottom 3 and her chewing her out for letting her take her character and then not meeting the mark... make it happen laid ease x"
4256,2020-12-22 21:31:13,kidzud,"This is shaping up to be one of the more interesting snatch games we've had in recent memory, and stats might not be the end-all-be-all this time around, with concept having a large part to play in it. Nubia playing the IRL snatch game flop character could drag her down, Diva seems set up to have a stint in the bottom and Tayce's concept is going to be very hit or miss depending on things. On the other side, having Aminata win and Diva in the bottom could make things very interesting from a storyline perspective, but I think the episode is likely shaping up for a Tyra win instead - and with both Egyptian monarchs playing dead pharaohs and Psychotique playing a dead French noble, we're shaping up for one whacky entertaining Snatch Game."
4257,2020-12-22 21:04:18,kidzud,🙄
4258,2020-12-22 21:05:44,kidzud,TYRA WINS YUP YUP
4259,2020-12-22 21:08:57,kidzud,"You might want to check at least Tayce's stats again, he's got tier 1 impersonation 👀"
4260,2020-12-22 21:09:49,kidzud,Oh shit I mixed up the impers and comedy- same total regardless but I'll fix 😅

4263,2020-12-19 06:38:51,kg2bot,Eve sucks. And her husband. The other characters are great.
4264,2020-12-19 07:11:33,kg2bot,"Oh this is definitely an unpopular opinion! I love that show so much! But opinions are like arse-holes,  in that we’ve all got ‘em  :)"
4265,2020-12-19 11:02:40,kg2bot,I thought the unpopular opinion here was that murdering a woman named Eve was bad.
4266,2020-12-19 14:20:37,kg2bot,I thought the title referred to Villanelle’s favorite time of day
4267,2020-12-19 06:54:00,kg22ve,"For people who are thinking this is the ultimate summary of EA types, note that there are way more types than what OP has put down for all four racial groups. China alone houses 56 ethnic groups. Even within the so-called ""Southern Han"", there is much more variety, and I've noticed not even once did OP include a picture of a celebrity whereas he did for the other groups. Someone like Wang Leehom should absolutely be included as a distinct S. Chinese look for example. Also, notice how OP put fewer examples for Koreans and Japanese, and only including three examples to demonstrate the Japanese range.

There's much more variety to all of these groups, even for Koreans who are commonly thought to be more homogeneous. Any two given Koreans may look considerably different, while looking ""common""."

4272,2020-12-18 20:34:53,kfszc2,Beautiful and classy. Much too good for us perverts.
4273,2020-12-19 05:21:18,kfszc2,Definitely very underrated
4274,2020-12-18 20:42:46,kfszc2,*Oh* my god she’s stunning
4275,2020-12-18 20:46:23,kfszc2,I’d eat her creampies
4276,2020-12-18 20:17:03,kfrpmu,The experiment was awesome! Great idea. I love that Jessica dressed sexy to lure her brother in the experiment.
4277,2020-12-19 08:23:26,kfrpmu,Awesome story!
4278,2020-12-19 12:36:57,kfrpmu,Suite ? C'est si chaud.

4282,2020-12-18 18:08:09,kfohq7,Two more very level-headed sounding housewives for the Jersey roster lol. I do like Mia's tagline about spiders and snakes.
4283,2020-12-18 18:09:34,kfohq7,"There’s no way these rich ass women are gonna be this normal onscreen. I laughed very hard at Ashley saying:
“Sandra Bullock would play me - this is based on her role in Miss Congeniality.” Gold."

4285,2020-12-18 13:44:43,kfjkeh,"I think Christina would also be super busy as she's running a medical center of her own. Disregarding the time differences, I'm sure she's busy trying to make sure her own medical center stays safe too"
4286,2020-12-18 17:29:57,kfjkeh,Lack of Alex too. I think I’m more upset about the Alex situation than the death of Derek.
4287,2020-12-18 14:03:28,kfjkeh,They could show maybe a text
4288,2020-12-18 11:59:24,kfjkeh,"It must be difficult for the writers to think about little details like that. Cristina has been gone for ages so I think her contacting Mer or anyone of the others contacting Cristina is not something the writers have on their minds right now. 

We can't exactly expect them to take everything the fans and viewers want into consideration."
4289,2020-12-18 17:02:59,kfjkeh,"They barely manage to squeeze in the characters they are actually working with at the moment (like Hayes or Link not even being in some of the episodes), so I'm not surprised this isn't exactly something they thought of."
4290,2020-12-18 23:38:26,kfjkeh,"For real!! They could have had Bailey(Christina’s teacher)/mcwidow(who she sent to Meredith) getting blown up by Christina and saying something like “yang’s been asking/wants to be updated” 
Would’ve been realistic way and something easy and sweet to show how close they are!"
4291,2020-12-18 12:46:55,kfjkeh,I feel like if Alex was still on Grey's he would be facetiming Cristina all the time for her to see Mer
4292,2020-12-18 11:52:02,kfjkeh,When they said it's time.. I thought they were gonna call her. But may be not. She's not coming back. I shouldn't keep my hopes I guess
4293,2020-12-18 11:55:14,kfjkeh,I agree. The last I remember of Christina was when she “sent” Hayes. We know Sandra won’t come back but would they just drop her character if they kept her around before? Especially now.
4294,2020-12-18 16:49:17,kfjkeh,"Of course it would cause concern, but there are travel restrictions."
4295,2020-12-18 20:27:07,kfjkeh,Exhausted over worked doctors and nurses. Not texting much.
4296,2020-12-18 12:35:06,kfjkeh,"Right, I think sometimes people forget how long ago some of these characters left the show. It's the same with Lexie...she died in season 8 but people still get upset when she doesn't get casual mentions nearly a decade later (and I'm not talking about the beach, I mean just casual name drops in conversations that they think would apply to her in some way.) At some point you just have to be OK with absent people living in the present casts heart off screen."
4297,2020-12-18 16:50:42,kfjkeh,"Doctors in Switzerland can't just take time off during a pandemic to fly to the US, when there are travel restrictions and the doctors are needed in Switzerland too."
4298,2020-12-18 17:44:23,kfjkeh,same. I liked Alex more than Derek tbh
4299,2020-12-18 11:56:01,kfjkeh,when she said it’s time i thought they meant she was dying
4300,2020-12-18 18:28:06,kfjkeh,They should’ve just killed him off. The way they wrote him off was simply not believable at all.
4301,2020-12-19 16:14:17,kfjkeh,Yeah. I too thought of that but I thought they were gonna call Yang to somehow try and fix it
4302,2020-12-18 19:09:02,kfjkeh,"Thank you! I’ve been saying this to my friend!!! i felt like the way Alex left undid all the growth his character had over the past 16 seasons. I get that he values his new(?) family because of his childhood but i thought that he had matured enough to be able to tell at least Mer in person. It just seemed so abrupt and they used a body stunt during the whole letter reading thing, ugh."
4303,2020-12-18 19:24:11,kfjkeh,I agree. Didn't do justice the character to think he would just leave Jo (and Meredith) without even a word. Nope.
4304,2020-12-17 18:38:08,kf183g,First option

4307,2020-12-19 15:24:01,kep66t,"This was a solid second part. While the whole trip to Gotham might have ended up being a distraction, it was still a good read. Seeing Barbara interact with the Opal City gang was nice, and I think connecting Hope's pain to Barbara's was smart. I hope they keep in touch, I think Hope and Barbara could be pretty good friends."
4308,2020-12-17 21:14:51,keo50u,Riso just read us all to filth
4309,2020-12-17 17:45:05,keo50u,Since when do 6s want to be accepted? Honestly I might just go with 7
4310,2020-12-18 14:10:19,keo50u,That's a core fear if 6s. To not be accepted is to not have security.
4311,2020-12-18 15:09:41,keo50u,so I’m 7
4312,2020-12-18 15:47:00,keo50u,Not if you're actually slothful
