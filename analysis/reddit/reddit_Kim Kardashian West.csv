1,2020-02-03 20:18:51,eycxzu,"Everyone says this, the novelty wears off pretty fast. I had a pool growing up, parents barely used it, that's how it goes. 5 other people live there too so I'm sure it gets used."
2,2020-02-03 21:34:25,eycxzu,I‚Äôll admit I have a pool and maybe use it 5 x a summer. My husband forces himself to go in. But it is great for kids and entertaining
3,2020-02-03 20:45:29,eycxzu,"I thought that initially too, but she said the kids and cousins use it all the time, although she did make it seem like they really only use the stairs. Also conflicted on them saying instead of having a jacuzzi they just keep the whole pool warm all the time, seems like a waste of energy, but so would building a whole separate jacuzzi I guess."
4,2020-02-04 01:38:17,eycxzu,My fav is their living space that has the glass and the green wall outside it. Love that!
5,2020-02-03 22:09:03,eycxzu,Crying that Kanye pronounces bathroom as bafroom as a 42 year old
6,2020-02-03 23:48:56,eycxzu,"OK I get that people don't tend to use their own pools that often. (I'm in the UK and a pool at home has always seemed like such a luxurious American thing to have! Our gardens are small and it rains all the time here ok. Let me dream!) 

But to not even have tried it out?? Not to just see how it feels to swim in the pool even once? I don't know how much that pool cost but likely hundreds of thousands of dollars, right? To be able to spend all that money and then not even have the slightest curiosity to use it? That's mad to me. That pool probably cost as much as an apartment."
7,2020-02-04 16:44:09,eycxzu,"I bet the kids use it. My mom didn't like to swim as much cause she would ruin her hair. I bet that is why Kim doesn't. All that work she puts into her hair and makeup would be ruined in a second. 

My family was lucky to have a pool when I was in HS. We were in it all the time and always had friends come over to swim. We also lived in S. TX where it is hot and humid 24/7. The pool was my favorite thing in HS. Hopefully I can have one day!"
8,2020-02-04 06:13:20,eycxzu,Bet she can't swim... but i'm sure she can float.
9,2020-02-04 06:14:09,eycxzu,"Man I love pools.. not really novelty, you can get a great workout and relax."
10,2020-02-04 02:06:04,eycxzu,think of the stairs as a shallow end. it's definitely more fun for the little kids to splash around and stuff.
11,2020-02-04 01:40:32,eycxzu,I literally thought he was joking at first but I think that‚Äôs how he really says it
12,2020-02-03 22:45:11,eycxzu,LMAO
13,2020-02-04 05:41:55,eycxzu,"A standard, basic pool in America really only costs about $30,000."
14,2020-02-05 22:19:55,eycxzu,That‚Äôs how much my bachelors degree cost!
15,2020-02-04 18:42:19,eycxzu,"""really only"""
16,2020-02-04 20:16:32,eycxzu,"I was just reacting to the ‚Äúhundreds of thousands‚Äù comment from the previous poster. I agree, though. It still isn‚Äôt cheap. Just doesn‚Äôt cost $100,000+"
17,2020-02-04 20:17:29,eycxzu,yeah fair point actually! apologies for misinterpreting
18,2020-02-04 20:18:26,eycxzu,No problem. I gotchu. üëçüèº
19,2020-02-03 14:10:13,ey7l55,"can someone explain to me how this house worth jumped from 20m to 60m in less than a year, also i wonder how much the house worth now after all the changes they did ?"
20,2020-02-03 15:00:42,ey7l55,Why do they always show the same three rooms ü§î
21,2020-02-03 14:10:28,ey7l55,That was an interesting read.  I think the house is very reflective of their relationship dynamic.  Before Kim married Kanye she had a lot more fun with her personal style.  Her old house and the clothes/makeup she used to wear were totally different than they are now and she loved to play with colors and glam elements.  She really changed her entire style to match Kanye's.  I'm not going to speculate whether she's happy with that decision or not but I do think it's very interesting.  To me it's clear this house is like 95% Kanye's taste and 5% Kim's.
22,2020-02-03 14:09:24,ey7l55,"So beautiful I mean that‚Äôs a given, but the all white is sooooo strange haha. I believe another followers opinion on here that they think half of the house has color and stuff. And what‚Äôs seen is just to put on the show."
23,2020-02-03 17:30:16,ey7l55,"I want to see the kids‚Äô rooms so bad


Edit. Yayyy we got norths room!"
24,2020-02-04 07:45:24,ey7l55,"Okay, I love it. When I first saw it I was like. Nah, that's no house, but of course we're not seeing the full house (for privacy reasons, they probably shouldn't, although I'm soo curious). Now, seeing the AD article, really makes me want to jump in and see all of Kanye and Axel's ideas! 

That being said, as a super messy artist that loves ceramic titles and crazy wall paper prints, all the tones of white really make me want to add color on the hallway walls and rooms. Otherwise it's very cool and serene."
25,2020-02-04 18:40:37,ey7l55,"its funny that she wasn't even sure of what to call the room they were sitting in the for the interview.  I think that is also  very telling of their home design choices. She defers to him for his inspiration, and his extensive knowledge and expertise in design. 

I just find in that video that he's so sweet and kind and she seems annoyed with him. That was uncomfortable a bit.

With that said the house is so beautiful and calming . I love it."
26,2020-02-03 16:39:31,ey7l55,"It was 20 mil and out of nowhere Kris said it was 60 mil, and now that number is everywhere. It‚Äôs going to be embarrassing when they won‚Äôt be able to sell it for 60 mil"
27,2020-02-03 16:18:06,ey7l55,"There's no way that place is worth 60 mil. I love it, but nothing in that area is worth that much unless they have enormous amounts of land attached in the back or something. There are better houses on the most expensive streets in bel air that aren't worth that much."
28,2020-02-03 18:07:07,ey7l55,"I believe they bought an adjacent plot which increased the value. But it‚Äôs still not worth 60m, that‚Äôs just a Kris-ism. Maybe it‚Äôs insured for 60m including all furnishings, art, valuables, etc. No way they can sell this for that much when it‚Äôs four times the value of the average house in their neighborhood."
29,2020-02-04 12:28:08,ey7l55,agreed
30,2020-02-03 17:04:07,ey7l55,That would be crazy! I remember they showed North's room and it looked like a rock cave and it was tiny. I remember Kim mentioning the kids have a play room so there must be color in there at least.
31,2020-02-03 16:44:23,ey7l55,It is probably worth 15-20 mil ish looking at comparable properties in the area. I don't understand the need for such a large lie. Like saying its 25 or something I would get if they wanted to flex but putting 40 million imaginary dollars on? Lmao. Silliness.
32,2020-02-03 19:07:52,ey7l55,Update:  Kim just posted a picture of North's bedroom and its bright pink.  They must have recently redid it.
33,2020-02-03 16:52:06,ey7l55,"I know, at most double the 20 and push it up to 40 mil. But Kris really went overboard for no reason. It was so unnecessary too, she retweeted an article and said it‚Äôs 60 mil. It was so stupid"
34,2020-02-03 21:35:07,ey7l55,Lol that‚Äôs funny!!
35,2020-02-03 16:56:17,ey7l55,"They expanded it a lot. I think the original was 20 mil, now it‚Äôs 40 mil. No WAY is it 60 mil."
36,2020-02-03 09:52:46,ey1hq1,"My thought after Bloomberg‚Äôs ad, having seen both of them: ‚ÄúMan, these shitty old billionaires really want us to believe they don‚Äôt have a problem with black people.‚Äù"

Lorelai in Gilmore Girls, the small town vintage store cords and graphic tees look. There was so much good music in that show, I got into band ts with long layering shirts underneath, which was also a Lane style. Big boots past your teens. Peacoats. Long sleeved tshirts.

Gwen in Torchwood -- nothing exact, but I really liked her black chucks, jeans, and office casual look for work. I still aim for that look now that I work in tech and it's a jeans office. 

I liked how they styled Amber Riley in Glee, so I bought a bunch of her asymmetrical style tshirts. I just got rid of the last one bc it was white and I spilled coffee too many times. I went out clubbing a lot with that look of the statement shoes, loud tights, and tshirt.

Catherine Tate in a few things - she and I have a similar body style (she wears it better), so I copy her style sometimes. I LOVE everything they put her in in Much Ado and most of her Doctor Who and Office looks are very attainable, like you can find that stuff in the mall.

So i do wonder if the clothes are so great, or if it's being that tall and slender and ... her Kate-ness that makes the clothes look extra special, &    I might be disappointed in how it looked on me.
I loved Meghan's satin skirt, the brown one that's probably ruined as that pic's been everywhere! ""What I Wore When I Left The BRF"". (I wished i could hand her a brush that day too)   So no, I've never bought anything super famous ladies have, but honestly? I'll never have that kind of money. And if i did, having lived with people way worse off than i? A dress that costs a month's rent just isn't something i could buy.  BUT!  :) I'm a champion bargain hunter, and I do believe in investing in good, classic pieces. So if Kate wears the perfect black trousers? I'll hunt those suckers down :)  The only really memorable - to me - outfit Meghan has worn?

I loved mine in high school but once I wore my brown pair to pieces I never repurchased for whatever reason. Maybe due to guilt of ‚Äúleggings, uggs and sweater‚Äù regularly getting shit on but I never looked back. They were comfortable though"
183,2020-01-20 13:32:35,er78xg,I have the Scuffettes and I don‚Äôt regret a single cent. Little foot clouds.
184,2020-01-20 15:21:01,er78xg,"I bought some Emma Roberts sunglasses too - the Versace ones she wears at the end of AHS Apocalypse! My favorite sunglasses.

If I could afford everything Chanel Oberlin had in Scream Queens... oh man... obsessed with her outfits, especially season 1. Not really my usual go-to aesthetic (thank goodness because $$$) but she is so goals in that show."
185,2020-01-21 21:58:02,er78xg,her fashion on that show was a key reason to watch
186,2020-01-21 02:39:55,er78xg,Her sunglasses game is **transcendent.**
187,2020-01-20 12:46:12,er78xg,Take it to a tailor and see if they can do anything for you. Might be as simple as putting some panels at the side to expand the top.
188,2020-01-20 18:49:48,er78xg,I LOVE that dress!! I too saw it on the RealReal but I don't remember if it was my size and I wouldn't have anywhere to wear it to.
189,2020-01-20 14:42:41,er78xg,The Olsens have been my style queens for years
190,2020-01-20 16:29:26,er78xg,Also their clothing line Elizabeth and James. Love.
191,2020-01-22 09:18:07,er78xg,"If there's one celebrity fashion style that I admire, it's the Olsen twins.  Their clothes are seriously expensive but those women have a superb sense of style, so I, too cannot afford.

Another celebrity who's style I like is Kate Moss, especially in formal wear.

Have never purchased anything by them though."
192,2020-01-20 17:29:10,er78xg,I love their style but I couldn‚Äôt pull it off if I tried. It works for them though
193,2020-01-21 00:27:40,er78xg,Love the Olsen Twins' fashion! Especially Mary Kate. Iconic.
194,2020-01-20 15:49:19,er78xg,"I bought a mimic of the blue dress she wore for the engagement announcement. I want to get it tailored to be just a smidge shorter though. I'm not as tall or slender as Kate, and it makes me look too short lol"
195,2020-01-20 15:31:25,er78xg,Are there any similar Instagram accounts worth following?
196,2020-01-21 02:45:49,er78xg,"As a lover of Kate's style, this website is GOLD"

198,2020-01-20 08:40:54,er78xg,"Michelle Obama wore a dress from White House Black Market for a TV appearance. Newspapers ran with the story because she was wearing an affordable ""found in malls near you"" brand. I'd never heard of them before, and decided to check them out.

Now my entire professional wardrobe is WHBM."

201,2020-01-20 07:53:44,er78xg,That ring pair is so beautiful! Is that your wedding set?
202,2020-01-20 14:34:07,er78xg,Do you have a link? I'm interested in which one it is.
203,2020-01-20 07:15:51,er78xg,Which ones were they?
204,2020-01-20 16:59:51,er78xg,I follow her on IG and I like her style as well

206,2020-01-20 14:42:07,er78xg," Ooo, that's beautiful! I should knit one."
207,2020-01-20 15:08:34,er78xg,You wouldn‚Äôt happen to have a pattern would you?
208,2020-01-20 17:34:04,er78xg,Oh that‚Äôs awesome that you‚Äôre gonna make your own
209,2020-01-20 20:56:09,er78xg,"I have that coat as well, didn't realize she had one!"
210,2020-01-20 15:30:04,er78xg,I love Aritzia! They had a big sale and I bought some great stuff including an awesome wool blanket.
211,2020-01-20 12:31:20,er78xg,I too am obsessed with this coat
212,2020-01-20 14:01:25,er78xg,I have a Mackage I got on sale at Nordstrom Anniversary sale. Keep looking!!!
213,2020-01-20 16:06:21,er78xg,This coat is the only reason I was reading this thread! Haha I have beeen loving this style for a while now and I recently saw a pic of Meghan and wanted to know what it was. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs really something I would wear but I‚Äôm so drawn to it!
214,2020-01-20 21:08:10,er78xg,"Oh man, I wish I hadn‚Äôt looked at Mackage. The Mai trench is what I have been looking for!"
215,2020-01-22 04:00:25,er78xg,"Mackage‚Äôs sister brand Soia & Kyo tends to carry similar coats for about 30-40% cheaper, eg [Samia](https://www.soiakyo.com/ca/en/samia-double-face-wool-coat-with-hood/SAMIA-N.html) or [Britta](https://www.soiakyo.com/ca/en/britta-mid-length-double-face-wool-coat/BRITTA.html). 

I bought a very similar waterfall wool coat 3 years ago for around $300 CAD on sale. The wool is pretty thin so it won‚Äôt keep you warm beyond early fall but it looks fantastic!"
216,2020-01-20 14:49:16,er78xg,"Those pumps have been sitting on my wishlist for a while now! Sucks to hear they‚Äôre so small at the toe, I have narrow feet so they could still be worth a try but I hate the feeling of having my toes pinched together. They‚Äôre just so pretty though!"
217,2020-01-21 16:13:55,er78xg,"Hah! I stalk consignment sites for those Aquazzura pumps and now I'm super glad I didn't take the chance because I definitely don't have narrow feet. Totally with you on the wedding shoe choice btw. It'll be either those or sparkly Louboutin's for me, depending on what dress I end up with."
218,2020-01-20 17:38:02,er78xg,I have a friend who bought the Aquazzura pumps after Meghan wore them and she loved them. But she has narrow feet so maybe that‚Äôs why.
219,2020-01-21 20:53:11,er78xg,Meghan's shoe game is SO STRONG; her heels are simply divine.
220,2020-01-20 13:45:13,er78xg,When I was 17 my entire wardrobe was basically my attempt at emulating Veronica Mars' style!
221,2020-01-20 10:26:03,er78xg,haha i was just coming to post the exact same thing! can't say for sure that they suit me but i feel like an absolute badass in them
222,2020-01-20 11:43:31,er78xg,I bought so many things Est√©e recommended when I first started wearing makeup! Most were good but the benefit oxygen foundation was a CHOICE lol

225,2020-01-20 08:39:54,er78xg,I love my Birdies!! They took a couple wears to break in but they are like *buttah*. I hope you love!
226,2020-01-20 15:24:12,er78xg,I was thinking about buying a pair ... I hope this is allowed but would you be willing to send me your referral code?
227,2020-01-20 16:54:53,er78xg,"I just did, too! I‚Äôm so excited to get them soon. I ordered the seasonal Olive velvet pair, which was awesome because they‚Äôre on sale right now."
228,2020-01-22 18:23:43,er78xg,"Nice! I‚Äôm also a fan, and was lucky to get her white Keith blazer from Aritzia before they sold out. I love it and wear it often. I also ordered her black jumpsuit from Everlane which I haven‚Äôt worn yet. 

Looking forward to seeing more of her style, though I suspect some of it will be super casual now that she‚Äôs a west coaster."
229,2020-01-20 11:09:08,er78xg,I love her!! And these glasses rock!!
230,2020-01-21 23:43:45,er78xg,Ohh these are amazing!! Who is the brand?
231,2020-01-20 07:48:44,er78xg,I asked this question in a thread about royals and quite a few people said that they bought the Cuyana tote she has. So now I‚Äôm kind of looking into Cuyana to see if I can find a bag that fits my lifestyle
232,2020-01-20 08:39:13,er78xg,"Oh my, I have this, same color and everything. Never knew she had one! I absolutely love it and been using it every day for over a year. Only looks better with wear!"
233,2020-01-20 19:15:07,er78xg,"Try heating the insides of your Docs up with a hair dryer, then put on 2-3 pairs of thick socks and walk around the house in them. That‚Äôs how I‚Äôve broken 2 pairs in and it works pretty well in my opinion. I still got small blisters the first couple times I wore them out but it wasn‚Äôt as bad or painful as some people find the breaking in period to be."

235,2020-01-20 16:18:28,er78xg,"The skirt is nice live, but I did not like how Meghan wore it, and in fact in store, it is complicated skirt IMO, because it is thin. In store they got it styled with heavy sweaters on the outside which looks nice, but not sure if I did it I would freeze on the legs and overheat on top. And with thin  sweaters like Meghan , if you tuck it in it looks weird because the fabric is so thin.

We could use it with a light shirt or top in spring, but the color is so autumn-winter... Caution with that skirt."
236,2020-01-21 16:20:01,er78xg,Ugh is that the skirt she wore with those amazing Jimmy Choo velvet pumps? I neeeeeed them!
237,2020-01-22 00:15:14,er78xg,"I'm a huge fan of brown, it would be great to be able to buy ~more of it, but that skirt looks so so hard to style for regular every day life, which is too bad because it's gorgeous."
238,2020-01-20 16:29:19,er78xg,That ring is gorgeous! Sad to see it's sold out now!
239,2020-01-20 17:10:24,er78xg,like the same kind of shoe or the ones he physically wore??? lol
240,2020-01-23 00:51:09,er78xg,Now I really want a crazy stripe sweater
241,2020-01-23 00:50:17,er78xg,I am obsessed with that dress! I think Kelly Ripa wore it as well
242,2020-01-20 11:39:01,er78xg,I have three pairs of Viscata shoes after I saw Kate Middleton consistently wear shoes from that brand. I love them!
243,2020-01-20 17:49:19,er78xg,"Which coat? I can relate, I always want to buy stuff I see Heize wearing but I stop myself because shipping costs. TT"
244,2020-01-20 15:47:00,er78xg,Then perhaps this thread isn‚Äôt for you since it isn‚Äôt up your alley
245,2020-01-20 19:21:10,er78xg,Both of the royals wear normal everyday shapes/cuts that you could wear out to somewhere that is not a red carpet. You also see images of them rewearing the same pieces - which rarely happens with actresses and other celebs. So why not! You can get style inspiration from anywhere. Why not people who are part of the royal family.
246,2020-01-20 15:46:44,er78xg,"Eh, even if it‚Äôs not your style there‚Äôs no reason to comment on why others would take inspiration from a royal"
247,2020-01-21 12:42:51,er78xg,I don't understand why any modern woman would copy the style of a junkie who shot himself in the head with a shotgun.
248,2020-01-20 14:08:56,er78xg,"I was just about to ask if the small ones are deceptively spacious like some small bags can be. I got a small Kate Spade bag last year & it is useless, it‚Äôs really small & stiff so there is no room for anything apart from your phone & a lipstick."
249,2020-01-20 18:55:20,er78xg,[deleted]
250,2020-01-20 15:39:42,er78xg,If I pull the trigger on the East/west I am getting the larger one. But I felt how delicate the leather was and that is what kept me from buying it several months back
251,2020-01-23 03:21:07,er78xg,"Strathberry is my answer to the question as well! I bought the black East West last January and love it! I‚Äôm trying to make myself use it more because I really like it but get so scared of ruining it. 

I really want to get another one in a different color or maybe one of their other styles, sooner rather than later in case the price goes up again. It was selling for $700 a year ago and it went up to $750 a few months later"
252,2020-01-21 03:16:28,er78xg,Ding ding ding!
253,2020-01-20 07:50:09,er78xg,My guess is Camilla & Marc.
254,2020-01-20 10:55:03,er78xg,RM Williams maybe?
255,2020-01-20 07:15:37,er78xg,I believe they were also Kate's wedding nails.
256,2020-01-20 14:16:06,er78xg,"Mine too! It is a good bridal shade. 

My engagement ring has a pink pearl center so I basically wore that color for a year or so before my wedding."
257,2020-01-20 09:01:25,er78xg,I always use their top coat too. I‚Äôm on week 2 and they still look good still except where I broke a nail and some small stress cracks.
258,2020-01-20 10:57:59,er78xg,"Same! There are some stunning Essie colors, but the polish always chips after a couple of days. I‚Äôve had regular OPI manicures last longer than Essie gels. Maybe I just need to use a different topcoat."
259,2020-01-20 15:42:03,er78xg,Essie‚Äôs formula is usually weird on me. Almost too thin and usually comes out somewhat streaky.
260,2020-01-20 13:34:57,er78xg,"I've had good experiences with OPI also! The local nail salon that I frequent is switching to OPI because they feel they hold up better against time on the shelf, apply better, and last longer on the nail."
261,2020-01-20 13:20:42,er78xg,"Topless & Barefoot is my go-to nude polish. I either get nude or bright red, lol."
262,2020-01-20 08:20:53,er78xg,Yes! I saw it and immediately had to have it.
263,2020-01-20 08:20:07,er78xg,"I'm literally never going to actually wear it outside because it does no work with my boobs, but I still love it. I'd say go for it if your boobs are Phoebe's size or a bit bigger. It's really nicely fitting in general."

265,2020-01-22 16:27:28,er78xg,"Same! And then I realize it's almost exactly the same color as Urban Decay's Mrs. Mia Wallace, which I also own. But I love them both."
266,2020-01-20 07:41:27,er78xg,"My biggest critique is that she doesn‚Äôt get her clothes tailored when she should. She also needs a professional stylist. Her pants were usually too long, dresses too tight, wrong undergarments, shirts all wrinkled. Pretty girl and I actually like her style but her execution hasn‚Äôt been the best imho"
267,2020-01-24 03:24:55,er78xg,"Oh wow!
link?"
268,2020-01-20 07:55:13,er78xg,I like the slouchy fit of the coat! Just a matter of personal preference.
269,2020-01-20 04:14:25,er78xg,"Yes, it is that one! I love it so much."
270,2020-01-20 12:10:16,er78xg,I also like the slouchy fit of the coat. She looks like she is floating here because I can't quite see her shoes. Never seen the pants in high res like this before...it looks like they were hastily cut instead of hemmed and not even straight. Something I would do but then again I don't have people to take things to the tailor.  (Or have a tailor come to me)
271,2020-01-20 13:23:58,er78xg,"I would call that a black watch plaid, no?"
272,2020-01-20 13:59:59,er78xg,I love Isabella Olivier! They are the best fitting maternity clothes on the market IMO. My Seraphine stuff is hit or miss.

277,2020-01-20 14:19:43,er78xg,Yes can we just all agree business short shorts in pastel and cute patterns are good for work?
278,2020-01-20 07:31:36,er78xg,"omg, agreed! I love her style"

281,2020-01-20 14:17:43,er78xg,"It‚Äôs one of the few shows I actually looked at wornontv and a lot of the outfits were relatively affordable, even petras. They had her in a lot of ted baker. I saw the dress and it was maybe 80-90 full price and I didn‚Äôt buy it immediately but when it went on sale I couldn‚Äôt resist! I liked janes dresses too, i didn‚Äôt buy anything specifically from the show but I do like her style for the summer."
282,2020-01-20 21:05:05,er78xg,"Louboutins are notoriously uncomfortable, but people ignore the pain for the sake of fashion. If you have wide feet they will chew your feet and toes up. 

I find Prada pumps to be comfortable. Salvatore Ferragamo also offers wide options."
283,2020-01-20 19:54:53,er78xg,"No, they are very uncomfortable in general. Made for fashion and not comfort."
284,2020-01-21 00:26:52,er78xg,"There are a few comfortable (for heels) styles- I can definitely last all day in Very Priv√© or Vicky, for instance- but I would say most are quite uncomfortable. Most of my Louboutins I only wear when I know I won't be doing much, if any, walking."
285,2020-01-20 12:25:37,er78xg,She makes me want to be a professor and show up to class with a different jacket everytime.
286,2020-01-20 12:08:55,er78xg,"Not OP but I did this as well. They‚Äôre okay. Patent leather is patent leather, so I always found them a little tight (I‚Äôve since gotten rid of them), but the platform helped mitigate the height of the heel."
287,2020-01-20 21:37:34,er78xg,"Lk Bennett runs super small, which doesn't help. The ""old sledge"" style that Kate wears is not painful but not comfortable either. Louboutin simple and new simple are comfortable. The ""new sledge"" by lk Bennett, which are more of an almond toe are definitely painful"
288,2020-01-20 08:55:04,er78xg,"I still have them (had them resoled because they were so good). I still like them and they are great in winter. I use them mainly as slippers inside home, actually. Sometime I go to the grocery store and bar with them, but not really something I'd wear outside.  
I don't think they should ever have become a fashion thing, mostly because they were marketed for what they were not. I have seen girls wear them in the snow then complaining they ruined a 300$ pair of boots. Not to mention whose who wear them with socks and then complain about them stinking..."
289,2020-01-20 14:08:59,er78xg,"My Uggs are they most comfortable shoe I own. And some days your feet just hurt, maybe a bad blister or you were wearing heels all day. Nothing saves my day more than my Uggs. I never even wanted a pair, my husband bought them for me on a whim one year and I am forever grateful. 

They have ‚Äòcooler‚Äô looking shoes than the standard boot. If you have the money and are interested probably worth a look. They have heels, booties, clothes, etc."
290,2020-01-20 15:52:49,er78xg,After production ended a lot of her wardrobe was sold on eBay. I got a Prada bag for cheap as well as a silk dress.

Anytime anyone or anything can bring national attention and shed light on the pressing need for criminal justice reform is good.

What's she doing is a highly effective and solid use of the advantageous platform she commands.
Although she has piggybacked off of the emotionally charged, long and arduous years of work others have done, she has invested herself in helping to champion the release of several incarcerated people with success, and apparently intends to see this path further through. 

If her platform can raise and lift the issue of criminal justice reform, and expose these injustices to people who may otherwise not have ""cared"" had it not been for her involvement, I'm not hating on that.
And I heard something to the effect that (I may be incorrect) she's using some of her own money to help fund the project and retain lawyers.

It's sheer genius. Using her platform to follow somewhat in her father's footsteps. 

Edit: Also not really a fan, either."

You make valid points, it's sad that at a young age, girls and boys are shown this lifestyle that they idolize and want because they're popular amongst their friends. It's so unhealthy, I see my little cousins glued to their phones at all of our family gatherings and they hardly communicate with one another! They reference these bimbos online as if their lives are so interesting and you slowly see our society become more and more vain. Im a 29 y.o F and I  had Instagram for about 2 years until I deactivated it because I couldn't stand how much time I would waste on it but I also was older and more aware of my surroundings. It's easy to believe that their posts are a true depiction of their lives but I also know the truth behind some of it. Not to say that everyone on social media is fake, some truly put in the hard work and want to showcase the fruits of their labor but I'm old enough to know that whereas younger kids wouldn't. It's sad, and this has nothing to do with ""the unattractive hating on the attractive"", this is the smart calling out the stupid for mankind. My bf and I both don't have social media and when we tell ppl, they just look at us funny as if were weird when really we just see what an utter waste of time it is because it's all just bs and loaded with marketing tactics to .......  manipulate the stupid."

Sadly my niece & nephew are exactly same as yours glued to YouTube and insta and talking about how amazing these peoples lives are.. what they don‚Äôt seem to grasp is that when they are able to do what the influencers do (if they can) everyone will be doing it there will be no money and then they will be in a crap job because they didn‚Äôt apply themselves.

487,2020-03-22 20:56:00,fn4vsu,">What makes you think I‚Äôm unattractive lmao?

The fact that you're complaining about attractive people. Who would actually complain about people using their attractiveness to their advantage while said complainants are attractive themselves? Do they wanna lose their easy money and be forced to die working 9-5 five days a week, without being afford any time to spare for fun, while making jack shit?

>But by that logic do you really believe that unattractive people deserve to slowly kill themselves working 9-5 jobs?

Of course not, but I am saying that no attractive people in their right mind would chose 9-5 jobs that pay almost nothing compared to being a social media influencer they can get rich off of. Unattractive people don't want 9-5 jobs either, no one does, but sadly some are forced to settle, while there are still a good chunk of ugly people (men and women included) who can become music artists and be as rich, if not, richer than the influencers. As a result, only ugly people work 9-5 jobs, and they didn't choose any of it. 

>Look at the ads influencers post the majority are hypersexualized. They make their money as sex objects. And they don‚Äôt have enough self respect to realize what they are doing because they get a big pay check.

By that logic you might as well complain about models who aren't social media influencers as well such as Emily Ratajkowski, Adriana Lima, or Candice Swanepoel, all for the same reason. 

>Also do you know how hard it is to become a successful business woman and earn your money honestly.

The fact that you and I may not find them entertaining -- and from what I've seen on television about them I certainly would *not* -- does not mean other people are forbidden from enjoying them.  It gets sticky very fast when you start deciding who is worth getting paid how much. You indicate a willingness to judge how much entertainers should be paid (not as much as doctors, teachers, etc"") so you'll need to set up a government board to decide if auto mechanics are worth as much as teachers, are carpenters worth as much as dentists, are cab drivers worth as much as cleaning staff?  There are cases that can be made for all of these jobs and if it is a government bureaucrat making the decisions I suspect government bureaucrats should be making more than everybody."

531,2020-04-21 08:50:22,g5ba89,"Alexis's story was so touching and I am so glad she is out. Like Kim said depsite what everyone says about her freeing all these people from jail, they still deserve to do time but their cases have not been fair and the sentences have been too long"
532,2020-04-21 19:50:15,g5ba89,"Honestly people hate on Kim but she is really doing a lot of good for the criminal justice system. Alexis Martin was well known and the public protested heavily about her sentence, but even the media coverage couldn‚Äôt help her. Then Kim steps in and her sentence is rescinded - which is great!!


This also shows the corruption in the criminal justice system. The only ones who are acknowledged are the rich and powerful. Many people are wrongfully convicted but won‚Äôt be saved by a big name celebrity. I wish this system wasn‚Äôt straight up garbage but at least Kim is doing her part."
533,2020-04-21 13:01:02,g5ba89,"I remember hearing about this story quite some time ago, I‚Äôm really happy she‚Äôs finally being served justice.. I personally think in her case she did not deserve to serve any time, at all. She was underage when she was sex trafficked and killed her pimp in self defense."
534,2020-04-18 15:08:02,g3jqxu,"Uh, we DEF knew Angelina and Billy Bob were dating, they were on the cover of every rag...Same with Danson and Whoopi...thats when Ted was photographed wearing blackface at a party and caught a lot of hell for it. Again same with Keifer and Julia...they were getting married and Jason Patric ran off with the bride...these were ALL front page National Enquirer scandals for weeks so...what millennial wrote this? lol"
535,2020-04-18 06:38:43,g3ixlw,"This is difficult. If it was just her liking some celebrity, fine. But she is praising someone who made horrible racist remarks. I adored Kanye before that but now he is cancelled in my mind. It‚Äôs hard to stay with someone who gives people a pass for harmful racism"
536,2020-04-18 07:02:39,g3ixlw,Rome fell due to idolised celebrities getting into power. RIP USA.
537,2020-04-18 06:29:01,g3ixlw,Kanye supports Trump in a big way. She's being a traitor.
538,2020-04-18 07:50:20,g3ixlw,"Sounds like your over reacting, and pushing her not to like it and saying you feel like your raising a teenager may be creating the dynamic of you being superior to her in some way, like your the adult and she‚Äôs not, that could cause her to maybe rub it in your face or go a little extra with it, especially if she came from an environment that didn‚Äôt support the things she liked or was interested in when she was young.


I think the Kardashian family is trash, I think Kanye is in general a bad person, but my wife watches the show every week and I listen to Kanye‚Äôs music often, you can compartmentalize and ignore the bad parts, nothing they‚Äôve done is so terrible that you need to be in a Kim and Kanye free home. 

In the end only you really know if it‚Äôs a significant problem in your relationship, I wish you the best."
539,2020-07-13 07:22:51,g3ixlw,"To be fair what he said wasn't racist - that black people have been in mental slavery from when they got to America until today. 

It's the same thing as him saying ""400 years later we're buying our own chains"" - which no one ever went crazy about.

That said she's sounds a bit obsessed. Maybe try and ween her off with episodes of Newlyweds and some early Lupe Fiasco albums idk"
540,2020-04-18 06:36:08,g3ixlw,"I think we all fall into this toxic celebrity circles and tropes that's why cancel culture #MeToo emerged to be aware of these things since there are underdeserving artists who aren't problematic, talented but doesn't get the recognition they deserve brcause they're not feisty enough to stir controvery. I guess some of us are mature enough to overcome these traps. I remembered when I was 14-15 years old, I listened to Azealia Banks, then the bitch started to get demonic, catty and overly problematic the next few years when her career blew up. I stopped listening to her completely, even if she was a good artist. I understood that not listening to her music was out of respect to the victims of her verbal attacks and would not enable her to have a platform to attack and discriminateLGBTQ+, minorites, people of color and even random bystanders, God damn it! There's even a meme where you type ""Azealia Banks controvery + your birthdate"" and something shitty that she did will pop up on your birthday, lol! It was my choice long ago to not listen to Azealia and my girlfriend told me ""Go listen to her I'm not complaining about it why complain about Kanye"" I mean it's a little childish for her to say."

543,2020-04-18 11:50:34,g3ixlw,You sound just like her! Thanks though?
544,2020-04-18 06:44:58,g3ixlw,"Right bc supporting the artist is tacitly condoning their behavior and you don‚Äôt want to do that, but she‚Äôs fine with it. It‚Äôs a moral issue in many ways"
545,2020-04-17 03:39:50,g2u7oo,I just saw those two episodes recently! They were intact
546,2020-04-17 03:39:49,g2u7oo,Oh wait. I‚Äôm dumb. Apparently they did live episodes in both season 5 and 6?
547,2020-04-17 20:49:02,g2u7oo,I appreciate the live episodes but they have never been my favorites
548,2020-04-17 03:43:19,g2u7oo,"Yeah I got confused because they did live episodes in season 5 and season 6 (four episodes in total including East and West Coast feeds for both). For whatever reason I forgot they did that. I‚Äôve seen 30 Rock so many times and my brain combined the live episodes thinking they only did them in one season haha.

The ones from S6 where Kenneth tries to save live TGS are much better than the S5 one where it‚Äôs just about people forgetting Liz‚Äôs birthday IMHO. I feel like the plot was too thin in the S5 ones which is why I sorta forgot they even happened."

Of the kids i think Kourtney picked the best names, I think Penelope Scotland is super cute. 

Great post, OP. I love celebrity names. I did a ‚Äúkids of Teen Mom‚Äù post awhile back that was fun."

i might be in the minority here but i personally love kim and kanye‚Äôs children‚Äôs names! i think my favorite is chicago, especially knowing how much pride ye has for his home town!

is true‚Äôs name a nod to khloe‚Äôs grandfather?"

No judgement, I‚Äôve just never heard of it and am wondering."
553,2020-04-16 03:16:40,g2633e,"I assumed it was pronounced Noelle but I can't say with 100% certainty. Agreed, Penelope Scotland Disick is one of my favourites as well! Thank you :) nice, I'll check it out"
554,2020-04-16 04:06:47,g2633e,"Thank you :). Yes True is a nod to Khlo√©s grandfather, and her great grandfather as well, True Otis Houghton. 

Chicago is so unique, the only multisyllable name of the West kids!  Other considerations were ""Jo"" after Mary Jo, or ""Grace"", but in the end Chicago/Chi won out"
555,2020-04-16 07:26:51,g2633e,"I‚Äôm surprised by how much I love North, just wish the last name wasn‚Äôt West."
556,2020-04-16 14:05:42,g2633e,"It can be. Some people drop their middle name in favour of using their maiden name in the middle. Others drop their maiden name entirely. 

So when Joyce Anna Smith marries Kevin Brown, she could choose to be Joyce Smith Brown, Joyce Anna Brown, Joyce Anna Smith Brown, Joyce Anna Smith-Brown, or not change her name at all and remain Joyce Anna Smith. I've seen all of those options amongst those I know who have married."
557,2020-04-16 05:06:23,g2633e,"i love jo and grace, but i feel like ‚Äúplain‚Äù names like that would look odd with the then sib set of north and saint (and even more so with the addition of psalm). i also love the nickname chi (or chi chi) i think it‚Äôs adorable! there‚Äôs so many places that could work as names that don‚Äôt get as much love as the popular ones"
558,2020-04-15 22:27:01,g2180e,Penelope Scotland is cute. True being named after her great-grandfather‚Äôs middle name is kinda cute too.

564,2020-04-16 02:01:06,g2180e,"Another interesting fact is that Kim likes one syllable names. Chicago is an exception, and it‚Äôs kinda difficult for Kim that it‚Äôs not a one syllable name. But Chi is so that‚Äôs that"

570,2020-04-16 06:19:11,g2180e,"I don't remember where I heard this but I heard that Reign's middle name was after Aston Manor, which is a club in Seattle that Scott loved."

For whatever reason I dislike the no middle name trend. I think middle names are so special."
572,2020-04-16 17:12:38,g2180e,"Interesting. I thought Kim's middle name came from her birth month being December, until I looked it up and found she was born in October. Maybe she was due in December?

EDIT: Maybe she was conceived on Christmas."

577,2020-04-16 01:47:08,g2180e,"Me too! Middle names are a fun way to pay homage to something or just add an extra *umph* to a name. I'm always interested to hear why people got their middle names when I learn them, but that may just be because I love names."
578,2020-04-16 02:28:07,g2180e,My grandmother didn‚Äôt have a middle name and said it was because they were ‚Äútoo poor and couldn‚Äôt afford one.‚Äù

583,2020-04-16 01:49:53,g2180e,how do they get armenian names? is it a translation of their regular name?
584,2020-04-16 12:19:32,g2180e,Remember when Kim was going to be Kim Humphries? I love it actually.
585,2020-04-16 03:14:59,g2180e,I just got Scotland after Scott lol
586,2020-04-16 02:10:29,g2180e,Oooh thank you! It doesn't seem to want to let me but I'll repost it there :-)
587,2020-04-15 22:59:31,g2180e,"That's pretty cool, had no idea they have Armenian names as well! Did they get them when they were baptized or always had them?"
588,2020-04-16 02:16:14,g2180e,"Yes! Also saw they were considering naming Chicago ""Jo"" after Mary Jo, or ""Grace"" but I guess Chicago/Chi won in the end, it's very unique anyways"
589,2020-04-16 05:04:17,g2180e,I think they should have just named her Chi
590,2020-04-16 03:19:56,g2180e,"Thank you:) yes agreed, I was surprised to find he had a middle name, and no wikipedia!"

If you aren't sold on Josephine, you could make that her first name, but pick a middle name that you would call her regularly. I know a few people who go by their middle names, it's semi common."
594,2020-04-16 02:35:52,g2180e,I feel like my grandma has told me the same thing.  Wonder if there‚Äôs any sort of truth to that being a thing.

607,2020-04-15 16:22:44,g1r3r6,"No chance it's about all of these? I think Taylor lived through one (or rather a few) of those years where you get taught the same lesson seven different ways around. As Kanye and Kim were attacking her, Calvin blindsided her with his tantrum, so disappeared Karlie from her life, and Scott and Scooter stepped in to screw with her. I think she took all of those experiences and that's where the song came from."
608,2020-04-15 14:59:25,g1r3r6,"I fully appreciate the amount of effort going into these posts. There's more concrete evidence in the voice memo from Lover \[Deluxe\] for IFTYE being a ""clean slate"" after reputation. I can't remember the exact quote, but I think she mentions it would be a great album opener to shake off the past. Or something.

Edit to add [this link](https://youtu.be/iH6df6NmZnI?t=21) to the voice memo, where she says ""I thought it might be a really fun way to open the album, like, basically kind of shrugging off a lot of things that you've been through that caused you a lot of struggle and pain."""

610,2020-04-15 17:34:04,g1r3r6,"You took a lot of time on doing this, you're great.

To me it's about Calvin or Karlie, not Kanye mainly for a reason: the origianl lyric of the chours: i thought i'd MISS you but i didn't. Why in the world she would have been miss Kanye if they weren't that close? 

The lyric: i would have been in the front row, even if nobody came to your show seems to remind the Coachella when she went there to support him ---> would've stuck around for you.

Thing is it can be about the many people who hurt her, but to me it's mostly about Calvin and i know that fans don't believe cuz she said that they are people who weren't able to inspire her which i don't believe that much tbh.. just remember that she has some lines of Dress ready one year before starting dating Joe so..."
611,2020-04-15 15:45:31,g1r3r6,"Oh my god, there are SO many good lines in this, **Volume II of Taylor Swift Pandemic Time Unsolved Mysteries Very Scientific Studies‚Ñ¢** :

*  ‚Äú*In the song he claims that either Taylor Swift or the grocery store Safeway was the one thing in his way.*‚Äú üòÇ
* *‚ÄúCalvin plays the role of, what we call in science, a chump in Reputation‚Äú* üòÇ
* Your handwriting on the timeline is giving me The Oatmeal vibes and I HERE for it.
* The inclusion of the Google trends data? \*chef‚Äôs kiss\*
* *‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have a partner I had climbed it with that I could high five.‚Äù*  I interpreted this to mean she didn't have a creative partner because she‚Äôs a solo artist. When the Dixie Chicks won after they were ostracized from country radio, they could high five each other. Taylor didn‚Äôt have that. Just my two cents!
* *‚ÄúI wrote a lot of think pieces that I knew I‚Äôd never publish, about what it‚Äôs like to feel like you‚Äôre in a shame spiral.‚Äù* For anyone interested in learning more on this topic, **Natalie Wynn** has a great video on [Cancel Culture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjMPJVmXxV8) and writer **Jon Ronson** has an excellent book called [So You‚Äôve Been Publicly Shamed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_You%27ve_Been_Publicly_Shamed).

**Peer-Reviewed Analysis:**

* *‚ÄúI forgot that you Got out some popcorn As soon as my rep starting going down, down, down.‚Äù* After reviewing the data, I believe Calvin deserves a higher score for his temper tantrum on social media. **Recommendation:** Calvin: ~~3~~  6
* *‚ÄúWould've been right there front row‚Äù*  Due to the aforementioned lack of rows in 'da club,' I actually would reverse their scores! The evidence shows that 2015-VMA-Speech-Writing Taylor would have shown up for Kanye. **Recommendation:** Calvin: ~~6~~  4 | Kanye: ~~4~~  6

**Conclusion:** The abovementioned changes would not dramatically impact the results of your findings. I concur with your analysis of the facts."
612,2020-04-15 19:11:44,g1r3r6,"I appreciate how much hard work and dedication you put into these, that‚Äôs great and you‚Äôre doing a great job. 

However, I think the song is probably just about her feuds in general and she took inspiration from certain parts of her relationship with people she was once close with. 

I really can‚Äôt see Taylor ever having the mindset of ‚Äúand I would have stuck around for ya, would‚Äôve fought the whole town for ya‚Äù for someone like Kanye. 
That to me is exactly how you feel when romantically invested in someone, or really really close (best friends, for example). 
I don‚Äôt think Taylor and Kanye were ever that level. 

And just because she put the song out on Lover doesn‚Äôt mean she was still hung up on Calvin. She could have just been thinking back to that time and felt inspired to write from that place, or something reminded her of Calvin and she felt inspired to write how she felt about that situation. Hell, she could have just had those lyrics sitting on her phone for a number of years and they didn‚Äôt fully come into fruition until the Lover sessions. 

She wrote about Joe Jonas in Holy Ground many years after their relationship and I highly doubt she was still pining for him or thinking a great deal about him years later. 

I think this is a song that Taylor drew lyrics from multiple situations she‚Äôs had and just wanted to sing a feel good song about forgetting those who had wronged her. Almost like a palette cleanser from reputation.

But it‚Äôs a great write up and appreciate the great research!"
613,2020-04-15 20:35:30,g1r3r6,"Very thorough!
Kind of irrelevant,but i always have the feeling that ""Hard to love"" by Calvin Harris is about TS.or not :p"

615,2020-04-15 17:58:54,g1r3r6,"I think it's fascinating that there's no complete songs dedicated to Calvin. I guess all the Reputation stuff completely drowned out songs that would've been about him... maybe those are lost in the songs that would have been TS6 but that became reputation? Also, does anyone else vaguely remember that he said in an interview not to write a song about him? I guess she did it! You're welcome, Calvin."

618,2020-04-15 23:00:28,g1r3r6,"Great job! Agree with your analysis, but also agree with the idea that the song is about everyone that's ever wronged Taylor (Kanye, Calvin, the media, some fans, etc). Opening the album with this song basically solidifies the fact that she is done basing her happiness on other people, and that she doesn't need anyone else's validation to be happy. 

Also I like the Kardashians but fuck Kim's role in this. üêÄ"

623,2020-04-16 03:37:56,g1r3r6,"I love Taylor Swift science. I think this song is about everyone who betrayed her in 2016. Kanye, Kim, Calvin, Karlie. But I always thought the first verse specifically is about Kimye, and the second verse is about Calvin, possibly Karlie as well. They all screwed her over to some degree during that time.
Kimye - for obvious reasons
Calvin - didn‚Äôt defend her when the song came out, denied ever collaborating with her, the Twitter meltdown, ugh it was all so petty
Karlie - apparently she was feeding personal info about her to Scooter, she never actually defended her when the song came, she just said Kim has always been lovely to her when asked about it, then the media jumped on it and she said ‚ÄúI will not allow the media to misconstrue my words. Taylor has always had my back and I will always have hers.‚Äù For someone who was supposedly her closest friend and had her own room at her apartment, she didn‚Äôt really go to bat for her and I can see why they would have drifted apart just from that."
624,2020-04-15 14:57:30,g1r3r6,I think it‚Äôs about Kanye mostly. She wouldn‚Äôt have any reason to be hung up on something wrong that Calvin did to her. I know her fans mostly hate him but I thought he seemed like a pretty good supportive boyfriend.

626,2020-04-16 03:54:20,g1r3r6,"This is seriously impressive. Kudos to you for your work and your argument.

I still think it's either about multiple people or Karlie though. I don't think it can just be about Kanye because she obviously never had a lot of love for him, and this song is about being so hurt by someone you would do anything for. 

But than I am a Gaydar-listening tin-foil-hatter so make of that what you will."
627,2020-04-16 05:17:56,g1r3r6,"Fixing to have to revise my draft report for bio 2, and IM HERE FOR THIS!! If I had gold, I‚Äôd give it all to you!"
628,2020-04-16 14:15:24,g1r3r6,"As said in the Zootopia song, ‚Äú I won‚Äôt give up no I won‚Äôt give in til I reach the end and then I‚Äôll start again. Though I‚Äôm on the lead I want to try everything. I want to try even though I can fail‚Äù"

631,2020-04-15 15:11:33,g1r3r6,"I fully believe that this song was about a Calvin. After reading this, I now believe it‚Äôs about Kanye. So job well done! Thank you"
632,2020-04-15 15:13:50,g1r3r6,okay but where's the column for karlie
633,2020-04-15 23:49:59,g1r3r6,"Wait, Calvin dumped Taylor? I thought she left him."
634,2020-07-28 23:18:34,g1r3r6,This is incredible
635,2020-04-15 21:20:02,g1r3r6,"Seriously though, this is amazing. University of /r/TaylorSwift has awarded you the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Taylor Swift Songology"
636,2020-04-15 16:31:34,g1r3r6,"I think you're right about the trauma of that summer, but there's nothing at all that points to her still being hung up on Calvin 2 years later.  

And 6 months after the phone call incident, Karlie came to her birthday party so they were still good enough friends for that.

Scooter screwing with her after her reputation tanked... yeah I absolutely think thats part of it and what I referred to in the discussion section as ""Kanye+"".  Kanye + everyone piling on, including Scooter."
637,2020-04-15 15:15:01,g1r3r6,"Kanye was in her life and in her head for many years. 

Why would she have still been hung up on Calvin 2 years later? She was so happy with Joe by the time this song happened."
638,2020-04-15 22:59:04,g1r3r6,"Yes, the original lyrics is the strongest evidence that it is not about Kanye. My bet is on Calvin."
639,2020-04-20 18:46:53,g1r3r6,Whoa how do you know that about the lines from Dress? I didn‚Äôt know that üëÄ
640,2020-04-15 15:54:40,g1r3r6,"Thank you for the comments!  I would completely agree with you about Calvin's temper tantrum and would have given it a higher score EXCEPT for the timing.  It happened before phonecallgate, which was the downfall of her reputation. If it had happened after and he was piling on, I would have given it a 10."
641,2020-04-15 19:40:17,g1r3r6,"But would she have stuck around for Calvin?  Like she wishes he wasn't a dick so she could still be with him instead of Joe? 

She said in Rolling Stone that the moment she experienced IFTYE was during the Rep tour and she described the experience is some detail so we know it wasn't a holdover emotion."
642,2020-04-15 18:11:18,g1r3r6,"I think it is too, but then again she was already falling in love and with Joe by the time she was writing Reputation (on top of the Kanye incident dwarfing everything), so perhaps it was hard to even work up the feelings about Calvin to give him a full song."
643,2020-04-16 04:14:05,g1r3r6,"I always wondered if it was just a really massive, passive aggressive diss to not have a single song about Calvin hahaha"
644,2020-04-15 23:49:17,g1r3r6,">this link

Probably because he'd release all of her secrets.  He doesn't seem like a nice guy."

649,2020-04-16 00:15:57,g1r3r6,"It's unclear. Reports at the time were that he broke up with her and I think he confirmed it, but she says otherwise in Getaway car.

Maybe it's that kind of thing where one person starts behaving in such a way that the other is kind of forced to end it?"
650,2020-04-15 17:46:18,g1r3r6,"I could see revising my comment about Karlie. I feel like a lot of what is thought about this part of her life is purely speculation. But I do think that Calvin is a part of this. You forgot to mention the ""Nils Sjoberg"" dig in the LWYMMD music video. I think she was more hurt not by the end of her relationship but by the fact that he turned out to be just another man unwilling to give her credit where credit was due."

652,2020-04-20 19:06:55,g1r3r6,She said it in a secret session.
653,2020-04-15 23:06:07,g1r3r6,Well if Better Man is about Calvin Harris (which I believe) I would definitely say she would have stuck around for him. That whole song is about her wishing he was better so she could have stayed.
654,2020-04-19 14:52:42,g1r3r6,Wait a minute literally in the middle of the night I realized.... is ‚ÄúBetter Man‚Äù about Calvin?????? Gonna need you to do a post on that one üòÖ
655,2020-04-16 16:48:26,g1r3r6,True but you never know she may have asked him not to say anything. She didn‚Äôt really comment on that video for a long time either.
656,2020-04-15 15:34:21,g1r3r6,"Whomp whomp I‚Äôll admit I scrolled because I didn‚Äôt see the column. I disagree with a lot of your interpretations of the Karlie lines, but like all of the other lines, everything is circumstantial and about things we‚Äôve heard rather than what has been outright stated. I personally can‚Äôt see this song being about Kanye because it‚Äôs about someone that Taylor would support and would be hurt to lose (or at least thought she would be). If this were written during Reputation I might expect it, but it‚Äôs significantly after Reputation."
657,2020-04-16 04:29:43,g1r3r6,"I always heard she broke up with him over a phone call. Also, her fans were harassing him and he wrote this on IG and then deleted it later: ""Bro I didn't leave anyone and she's def not sad. It's all good."" ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I‚Äôm sure after he didn‚Äôt join her at the Grammys and then said he‚Äôd never collaborate with her, she was done. He didn‚Äôt seem very supportive of her."
658,2020-04-15 18:13:25,g1r3r6,">Taylor on Kanye and Drake from Rolling Stone: ‚ÄúAnd then he literally did the same thing to Drake. He gravely affected the trajectory of Drake‚Äôs family and their lives. It‚Äôs the same thing. Getting close to you, earning your trust, detonating you."

They have sob stories and poor upbringings, it doesn't excuse them murdering people. Since when did getting molested become a get-out-of-jail-free card for murderers? How many freebie murders are they allowed? Cyntoia Brown shot a man in the head as he slept so she could rob him and just to feel what it likes to kill someone. Alexis Martin conspired with gunman to kill and rob her pimp by luring him and his brother into an ambush with sex. Next they want to set free Chrystul Kizer, who shot a pedophile in the head and robbed him and tried to burn down his house to destroy the evidence, while bragging she'd kill again.

If you're going to say that abuse suffered as a child is grounds to *free* someone is plainly a cold blooded murder and a threat to society, why do only young girls get a pass? Is that going to extend to some serial killer man who got diddled by his father and grew up as a monster?

Scott was still very mush apart of the family after him Kourtney broke up regardless of whether or not he was invited on some dumb vacation. 

How has Scott matured when just 2 months ago he was dating someone 16 years younger than him and had to go to rehab. No mature father of 3 is going to be running around town with their teenage girlfriend and abusing drugs."

What the fuck does that even mean? It's not been released yet. 

>says Kim is ‚Äúin her face‚Äù and ‚Äúthis was coordinated‚Äù

The language gets more disturbing with every episode. I'm starting to think that she might privately believe that Kim is trying to personally victimize her in some way and that's very scary if that's the case. Seriously. 

>Nat makes the argument that a trans podcast wouldn‚Äôt be handled by a cis person so why would kim handle this?

Lmao. A huge amount of people who work in criminal justice reform (from lawyers to media people and in-between) are white, should they all just down tools and go home? That's not an apt comparison at all. 

>Kathleen gets herself worked up into another rant and says that the announcement was big and planned and she knew it was going to be announced and they had a PR team

Um. What? Why wouldn't they? 

>Discuss ‚ÄúWhen They See Us‚Äù and that Kim must discuss that one (even though it has a series and she‚Äôs going to discuss a story that no one knows, no let‚Äôs discuss one that‚Äôs common knowledge) and say that she ‚Äúwon‚Äôt‚Äù discuss it because trump is involved (kay.)

But...the central park 5 are free and exonerated? There's an incredible documentary about them (must watch, it's called The Central Park Five and it's by Ken Burns), a phenomenal series, countless interviews and things. Why would she discuss them? They're free. The subject of the upcoming pod is in prison right now. 


>Kathleen says she‚Äôs doing it because she didn‚Äôt get attention for wearing a white outfit at the White House. 

0o

Ugh this. I should have really spelled it out this way, he has in no uncertain terms *ever* matured. He‚Äôs just white and looks like he‚Äôs sad all the time. It‚Äôs a difference, they need to circle back and change their stories. Tristan is a good gentle man who has made many mistakes but I believe he‚Äôs genuinely trying to change.

I was truly wondering why they mentioned the Central Park five and Kim ‚Äúhaving‚Äù to talk about them instead. That story is horrible - the point is that they *arent the only victims* of wrongful/harsher conviction due to race. Kathleen must think that since their story was so publicized that they‚Äôre the only ones?

I was just thinking this recently. Kathleen could not leave the podcast without Nat having to fully explain why; it couldn‚Äôt be done quietly. Their podcast, any Say Bible social media, and their personal social media are all too public. She would have to go into what ultimately led Kathleen to leave the show. So all the white savior fans wouldn‚Äôt have anyone to identify with at that point, since Kathleen is the main draw for the mainstream audience due to her whiteness and ability to make white people feel like talking over and for black people is totally acceptable and the definition of an ally."

947,2020-06-29 16:08:48,hi2o22,"Well, I was shopping in Walmart the other day, (with the intent of buying all of their guns, bacon and American flags) when I spotted a Mooslem running frantically up and down through the aisles, and his name was Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul. I was certain at any moment he would yell 'Allah Akbar'. Thankfully, my shopping cart was full of bacon (which as you all know, is Mooslem kryptonite). So I straightened my MAGA hat and pulled up my Confederate flag britches and grabbed a pack of bacon from my cart. I took that Mooslem over my knee and spanked his ass with the bacon while screaming 'Liberalism is a mental disorder!' over and over. Then, by the power of the bacon,  Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul instantly converted to Christianity and registered as a Republican. Trump showed up and awarded me the Medal of Honor because I probably stopped the next 9/11.

What the fuck did you just fucking say to me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ""clever"" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.

Me when I see 420 and funny secks number (420): WOW kid you just got R/WOOOOOOSHED!!!! üòÇüòÇüëÄ

My joke was so thoughtfully crafted and took me a total of 3 minutes, you SHOULD be laughing. ü§¨ What's that? My joke is bad? I think that's just because you failed. I outsmarted you, nitwit.ü§≠

Nobody: The phrase ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a game‚Äù is such a weak mindset. You are ok with what happened, losing, imperfection of a craft. When you stop getting angry after losing, you‚Äôve lost twice.

There‚Äôs always something to learn, and always room for improvement, never settle.

Welcome to Team Fortress 2. After nine years in development, hopefully it will have been worth the wait. To listen to a commentary node, put your crosshair over the floating commentary symbol and press your primary fire. To stop a commentary node, put your crosshair over the rotating node and press your primary fire again. Some commentary nodes may take control of the game in order to show something to you. In these cases, simply press your primary fire again to stop the commentary. In addition, your secondary fire will cycle you through all the commentary nodes in the level. Please let me know what you think after you have had a chance to play. I can be reached at gaben@valvesoftware.com, and my favorite class is the Spy. Thanks, and have fun!

The Declasse Vamos is now available in southernsanandreassuperautos.com

Season X is here, and the world is destabilising, fast. But, don‚Äôt worry, that means there are a ton of new ways to play Fortnite! From the B.R.U.T.E., a new 2 player vehicle that packs some serious fire power, to mysterious Rift Zones that alter your favourite POIs in unexpected ways. Huh, that's weird. Season X delivers new experiences for all players to enjoy. There are new places to explore, new secrets to uncover, and the world you play today, may not be the world you play tomorrow. In addition to all new gameplay found in Season X, there's also a brand new Battle Pass, that'll introduce new 'dimensions' to some of your favourite Fortnite characters in ways you've never seen before. And at Tier 100, you'll unlock Ultima Knight. Plus, don't forget, there are new emotes, gliders, wraps and more to earn as you advance through the pass. The Battle Pass is available right now, for just 950 Vbucks! We'll see you ingame.

1016,2020-06-28 03:47:31,hh7lvd,Twitch isn‚Äôt owned by Google. So this is the opportunity for Youtube to snatch the game streamers Microsoft lost and Dr.Disrespect
1017,2020-06-28 11:12:34,hh7lvd,"Ninja is going to youtube, because he already has 23 million followers there.

Shroud probably back to twitch.

Dr Disrespect doing a publicity stunt right as other streamers are getting banned for #MeToo is pretty stupid."
1018,2020-06-28 12:54:45,hh7lvd,"For the people who keep saying short Spotify on all these threads...a tech stock that dips after its ipo and then makes a new high is the pattern I‚Äôve used to make almost all of my big gains.

Twlo, sq, shop, dkng...the average gain on these stocks is what like 2-300%?

Why don‚Äôt people just short airlines or department stores?

I know this time it‚Äôs different because corona and spy 50p 7/17 but I still think there‚Äôs better shorts then spot right now."

1021,2020-06-29 15:02:50,hh7lvd,"I have it on good authority that Spotify and Google are teaming up for this new streaming platform. Spotify will provide all the music royalty free to streamers which will convince most streamers to switch, and Google will monetize it with their YouTube ad network they already have in place. That means streamers will make more money per viewer than they are on twitch. Nail in the coffin for twitch IMO. Both Spotify and Google will profit from this. Rumor is that Ninja, Shroud, and Dr. Disrespect have already signed... I bought calls this morning for what it‚Äôs worth. Bless up"
1022,2020-06-28 04:30:16,hh7lvd,Howard stern XM contract ends this year so Spotify could be reaching out to him on a podcast deal as well

This was from gameplay back on June 19th where he's talking to another streamer, Timthetatman, about Joe Rogan getting his $100m deal with Spotify. They started talking about what's next after Twitch which seemed like an innocent convo to fill the time between games. This is also around the time Mixer folded into Facebook making Shroud and Ninja free agents. Seemed like a planting seed conversation with Tim who's also a huge streamer on Twitch.

Edit: Convo is around 3 minute mark"
1027,2020-06-28 15:23:54,hh7lvd,I don‚Äôt think the market cares about Amazon‚Äôs twitch. I‚Äôm not sure how much it would care about a competitor on Spotify. When Microsoft‚Äôs Mixer launched the market didn‚Äôt care and when it went nowhere and was discontinued the market didn‚Äôt care. I know Spotify is a smaller company but still. Game streaming isn‚Äôt it‚Äôs main story or business.
1028,2020-06-28 16:30:55,hh7lvd,Ripe for a WSB cameo
1029,2020-06-29 00:15:55,hh7lvd,"If the streaming site is legit I think it brings in more then just gaming content. Plus potential for streamers or content creators not to have dmca strikes on their channels due to music rights, since Spotify should own the rights to play those songs. 

Spotify is making a push to become more then just a music streaming service. I‚Äôm going bullish on this 100% Spotify hits $500 by the end of this year.

For anyone interested google ‚Äúbrime‚Äù or watchbrime for the Twitter account of this new service."
1030,2020-06-28 04:09:23,hh7lvd,Idk about gaming but after I heard joe rogan was moving to spotify including his video podcasts I was thinking that maybe some artists will be releasing music videos exclusivly on there. Not sure how or if that would affect the stock but there seems to be a lot of potential for shit they can do with spotify. Although maybe youtube is just way better exposure overall for music videos that it wouldnt be worth it for artists
1031,2020-06-28 12:49:14,hh7lvd,"Rogan and Kardashian are annoying as fuck, I don't watch live gaming streams, so the hell with ninja and shroud, and I've never even heard of Dr. Disrespect.

But his name sounds baller, so fuck it, I'm in."
1032,2020-06-28 05:23:16,hh7lvd,"Yeah this rumor is getting hotter, but so is the parabolic ascent of this company. Honestly, I think I'm gonna short the fuck out of this. 

Pull up the 1 year chart. It looks like it's time to run out of gas and plummet."
1033,2020-06-28 06:17:36,hh7lvd,I appreciate the enthusiasm but I just don‚Äôt see it. There is a high chance that there is a non-compete clause in his contract should it be void by breaking ToS or this would be too easy of a loophole. I mean he just signed a multi year deal with Twitch in March.

1055,2020-06-29 02:00:28,hh7lvd,"The reason nobody competes with YouTube for video streaming is because storage for billions of hours of video - mostly low quality garbage - is extortionately expensive for anyone who doesn't own petabytes upon petabytes in data centres.

If there was a barrier for it, music videos wouldn't have this problem. Have at least 10,000 monthly listeners? Welcome to Spotify Video. It will be limited, high quality content on demand, not a free-for-all for videos of your kids being dumb or cats chasing laser pointers. I've been talking about this big streaming service change for about a year now and generally my ideas get stolen right out of my head after about a year so expect it soon. 

Additionally - Patreon style 'follower tiers' for artists. Tiers including highest quality audio and video, bonus tracks, exclusive content feed (behind the scenes vids), members only chat room, private 'livestream gigs'

Right now bandcamp is the only good way to feel like you're ethically supporting artists, except it's a garbage platform. This is the next logical step. Bringing back that intimacy between artists and fans - bringing back monetisation to music videos (youtube payouts are about 1/10th of Spotify, it's abysmal), along with plenty of opportunities for the company to take a tax.

Look out for it"

1067,2020-06-28 21:42:15,hh7lvd,All youtube needs is a decent looking platform and chat interaction which currently is awful
1068,2020-06-28 05:02:43,hh7lvd,Yea. Youtube has been throwing out money to get some already popular twitch streamers over to their streaming side. It benefits Youtube overall because it will cause more engagement
1069,2020-07-05 17:10:09,hh7lvd,Spotify and Peleton are the two big new positions I took this year. I'm thinking about buying some calls in slack but the stock hasn't really moved except for the week before earnings (and then it crashed 20% after earnings)
1070,2020-06-28 04:29:43,hh7lvd,"Two hours ago he tweeted that twitch hasn‚Äôt given a reason behind ‚Äútheir decision‚Äù

Doesn‚Äôt sound like he‚Äôs making moves."
1071,2020-06-29 23:12:17,hh7lvd,Google and Spotify already collaborating via Nest - [Posted last week](https://www.google.com/amp/s/blog.google/products/google-nest/nest-and-spotify-summer-music/amp/)
1072,2020-06-28 12:12:28,hh7lvd,You say that like this streaming is a real thing. I can‚Äôt find a single article talking about it off WSB.
1073,2020-06-29 00:43:56,hh7lvd,"It is, but i just think that twitch has too big of a community to get contested. I think if youtube made a better platform or section for streaming that we could see some big youtubers bring it to life but i don't see spotify doing that. Though spotify can dodge DMCA charges easily, they've got that in their favor."
1074,2020-06-28 13:53:15,hh7lvd,I mean it‚Äôs Spotify... to act like a billion dollar company wouldn‚Äôt have planned this out is foolish
1075,2020-06-28 17:43:17,hh7lvd,"Fair, so I should clarify what I mean. The software is not easy, but if they're making moves like this their software is probably done already. I'm only saying that the literal infrastructure you need to run your software, the actual boxes in a datacenter, are there right now and if Spotify has the cash they can scale it fairly easily. This is why people care about the cloud, it makes scaling these kinds of services substantially easier compared to several years ago when you would have needed to host the entire service yourself. Will they want to run their service entirely on a cloud provider? Maybe, maybe not. It depends on how much they think they can save by running their own hardware, but it's worth noting Spotify already runs their entire service on google cloud. I may be autistic, but my gay bear put money comes from doing automation for these kinds of systems and I'd be surprised if they decided to host it in house."
1076,2020-06-28 14:06:29,hh7lvd,What a retard
1077,2020-06-28 21:59:52,hh7lvd,What? Bro I could set up cdn in 2 hours and that includes a smoke break and a jerkoff session
1078,2020-06-28 06:17:08,hh7lvd,Let Netflix and Disney+ in on the news so they can get off of AWS.  Obviously can‚Äôt compete with Amazon Video.
1079,2020-06-29 05:28:38,hh7lvd,There was a leak on 4chan
1080,2020-06-28 15:48:12,hh7lvd,There‚Äôs no way Youtube is gonna be a competition to Twitch. Mixer didn‚Äôt even get enough traction for people to move to their platform having Ninja and Shroud.
1081,2020-06-28 04:34:29,hh7lvd,"He knows how to get himself banned from socials, why would he do that is the real question. The video above looks very deliberate."
1082,2020-06-28 12:18:02,hh7lvd,Whether or not the streaming thing is real does not affect the recent Rogan and Kardashian deals
1083,2020-06-28 17:57:35,hh7lvd,"We knew what you meant. We are just giving you shit. If you consider the debt required to invest in something like that then it‚Äôs gonna be an all or nothing type bet, and if MSFT failed with mixer after recruiting the most popular streaming names, then I don‚Äôt think Spotify will have much luck doing the same. At this valuation I‚Äôd say success is priced in, but failure or mediocrity is most likely"
1084,2020-06-28 16:07:01,hh7lvd,"It‚Äôs so weird man, YouTube is really good for steaming it has everything that twitch lacks. But I just see YouTube as videos and twitch as streaming, I can‚Äôt force myself to watch streams on YouTube"
1085,2020-06-28 12:18:54,hh7lvd,2 good podcasts don‚Äôt make a company.
1086,2020-06-29 09:25:43,hh7lvd,"Thing is: Spotify has a shitton of music-licensing done, and they already have a platform with an audience.

People already use spotify for listening to podcasts, MSFT just took mixer and tried to get people to move over from twitch to completely new platform (from a users POV).

Spotify doenst need people to move over, since most people are already there."
1087,2020-06-28 13:56:29,hh7lvd,You say that like Spotify is just 2 good podcasts?
1088,2020-06-28 12:53:40,hh7lvd,"And I guess increasing popularity, better earnings, and a large moat don't either?"
1089,2020-06-28 14:36:31,hh7lvd,I‚Äôm saying 2 new podcasts isn‚Äôt going to make the company worth 20% tomorrow than today
1090,2020-06-28 14:37:38,hh7lvd,"I‚Äôm saying if you‚Äôre betting on Spotify because of WSB  rumours of game streaming, and thinking 2 podcasts will change an already huge business THAT much, you‚Äôre crazy"
1091,2020-06-28 15:10:10,hh7lvd,What?
1092,2020-06-28 15:14:27,hh7lvd,"and if you think fundamentals matter to tech stocks, you're even crazier"

I was certain at any moment he would yell 'Allah Akbar'. Thankfully, my shopping cart was full of bacon (which as you all know, is Mooslem kryptonite). So I straightened my MAGA hat and pulled up my Confederate flag britches and grabbed a pack of bacon from my cart. I took that Mooslem over my knee and spanked his ass with the bacon while screaming 'Liberalism is a mental disorder!' over and over. Then, by the power of the bacon,  Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul instantly converted to Christianity and registered as a Republican. Trump showed up and awarded me the Medal of Honor because I probably stopped the next 9/11.

(I‚Äôm probably going to get downvoted for this judging how some people here have reacted to this article) I still have empathy for him and his family. Just because someone is rich doesn‚Äôt mean that their mental illness can‚Äôt have a huge negative impact on their lives or that their pain should be erased.

But like, Kanye had several chances to tackle his illness, he had many doctors and his wife begging him to take medication so it doesn‚Äôt get any worse, but Kanye decided that he didn‚Äôt want to take them because he thought he won‚Äôt be a genius anymore and that his music will suck. His current manic episode is a fucking mess.

I don‚Äôt like advocating to lock mentally ill people up, but his mental health is getting to a point where he might benefit from an intervention until he calms down, as cruel as they can be."
1102,2020-08-20 15:47:38,ics1kn,"Kanye is an asshole who happens to have Bipolar Disorder, not someone with Bipolar Disorder making them an asshole."

Being bipolar isn't an excuse for running a spoiler campaign. It's never really an excuse, but I can understand why other bipolar people do what they do. I can't understand why Kanye does anything. I say he either gets out of dodge or what's coming to him. If you reject therapy and good advice, I can't help him, Kim can't help him and doctors can't help him either, he just needs to be dropped until he stops rejecting all and any help.

Also, strange that Kanye is thinking about a divorce before Kim. If you really can't get through to him at all, you should end up divorcing him yourself."

He's another musician who's career was bragging how rich and powerful he is. His lyrics previously explicitly mentioned Trump, who loved hanging out with famous people, and was a minor celebrity even before he got a reality TV show where celebrities got to compete in a fake business he set up.

This is an insult to everyone who has a condition who's not a shitbag. Many of these people especially ones who are not wealthy or powerful often get brutalized by cops or other authority figures.

There is a fear that mental illness is a part of your identity especially when you've been living with it for so long and have developed behaviors to combat the effects it has on your life continuing to go untreated has. 

Can we not minimize that fear?"
1109,2020-08-21 18:25:18,ics1kn,"the question is how much of what Kanye does is a free choice, because a lot of mental illnesses literally change your brain, addicted people often have a thinner area that's for self control, so its physically harder to say no. (thank fuck its trainable but that needs compassion, help some control and ofc the will.
but will alone isn't worth a lot  if your brain struggles with shit coming easy to others who, especially in this cases of invisibile illness act as if the sick person is always as fully able to choose as a healthy neurotypical one without generational trauma, for example. . 
nobody would expect someone who lost  their legs to run as okay as someone who has the legs.  
but it's often different for invisible disabilities, chronic mental illness is usually a disability."

Not taking responsibility for one's actions (and how they might affect the people around them) is a pet peeve of mine, so maybe that's why.

I don't think Kanye's case has to do with a lack of will, more like a lack of insight into his illness. Either he doesn't realise how destructive unmedicated BD can be, or he does, but that insight vanishes once he enters a manic episode. (it's part of the illness)

But in that case you'd expect him and his entourage to have made some concrete plans on how to deal with a psychiatric emergency like this one. Sadly, that didn't work out so well for his recent episodes, seeing he's being exploited as a modern-day freak show attraction."

1119,2020-08-20 16:35:03,ics1kn,It doesn't magically make someone support fascism. Kanye has been a douche bag going back years and he knows it himself. He got rich and chose to get richer. He married into a shitty Republican family who's only achievements are getting OJ Simpson out of jail and monetizing a sex tape leak.
1120,2020-08-20 20:40:24,ics1kn,"Kanye, when being treated, regularly and deliberately goes off medication because his thinks *this* Kanye is his best self. 

He's very much the architect of his own disaster. Even if you want to argue his illness is the causative factor of him being an utterly unpleasant person, that doesn't make him any less of an unpleasant person. Being ill doesn't magically make his beliefs and actions worthy of respect. Being ill doesn't mean he's owed a single iota of public attention. Being ill doesn't mean tolerating the very real harm he's doing. 

Kanye kinda needs to fuck off. If he wants to fuck off and get treatment, stick with his medications, have Kim or someone act as a guardian to keep him on his treatment plan and spend some long personal time working to be less of a awful person, all the better. But it's been damn near a decade of this shit, it's only been getting worse, he has zero desire to do any of that, and all the compassion and understanding in the world wont undo the consequences of his actions.  

Also Kayne West isn't some joe trying to manage their BPD as best they can while scraping by. He's a god damn world famous billionaire, married to a equally famous woman who's nearly as obscenely rich as he is. Unlikely damn near every other person with BPD or similar he can littrealy afford to fuck off for a while. Somehow I think he'll manage just fine sitting in one of his multiple mansions, with access the best doctors and therapists in the world, with his own private chef and whatever other staff he wants, using a tiny fraction of his money to pursue littrealy whatever hobby or personal interest he cares to. Dude ain't getting thrown to the wolves."
1121,2020-08-19 21:50:31,ics1kn,">Show a little compassion.

Okay, if you insist: he shouldn't be institutionalized against his will again, even though that would solve the problem of his candidacy. The reason being that it wouldn't help him and would actually be cruel and unusual punishment since he isn't a concrete danger for a specific person. He's just endangering his own career and the lives of anyone at danger under Trump. There, a *little* compassion."
1122,2020-08-21 04:57:47,ics1kn,"Honestly people like the poster above you who obviously don't understand the illness shouldn't comment. Stuff like his campaign meltdown are directly related to mania, it's not him in charge he is in the middle of a mental breakdown and needs empathy. Ideas of grandiosity is a staple of a manic episode, as are the emotional instabilities shown when he's onstage.

His family have struggled a lot behind the scenes over the years, as Kim Kardashian-West's comments show. I figured as much with his last public outburst on TMZ, and frankly gave Kim Kardashian-West a side-eye when she tweeted that her husband's bipolar was not the cause. Obviously that was damage control to let Kanye recover in peace, and now she has no other option but to go public about it and ask people to let up on him since people are taking this as a serious political run and not a man falling apart at the seams.

It's difficult and contentious to blame someone in a manic episode for their actions in that episode when they're under the influence of a manic break. Even the bipolar community is divided on it. I can understand people who do. Personally I can't, I can feel anger for what someone has done, but at the end of the day it just isn't fair to blame someone for something when they suffer from something they can't control. Someone in mania doesn't realise they are out of control, and really can't control their actions -- the first thing to go is impulse control and judgement skills as bipolar chiefly affects the frontal lobe.

I can only ask that Kanye seeks help, as that is something I can blame him for, that he actively refuses medical help when it is clear he isn't coping and it's destroying his family, among other things."
1123,2020-08-22 21:24:50,ics1kn,Good thinking. I'll stop criticizing Trump now.

A **physical** danger to himself. You can legally attempt to commit someone because they are likely to attempt suicide, but not because they're hanging around with a bad crowd and might start doing heroin again, much less because you're hanging around with Trump idiots.

That's actually a neuratypical rights issue in and of itself: people getting committed against their will even though they don't pose a real (**physical!**) harm to themselves or others. 

>and others (fucking with an election.)

Not concrete enough for a good legal case. As such, since is a civil rights issue, no. You don't get to institutionalize Kanye against his will, even though he *is* a non-concrete danger to millions of people, because if you did, you would get to institutionalize other people that don't post a concrete danger to anyone. Oh, the whole office is scared you might murder them, off to the closed ward you go. Obviously not. 

Also, weren't you the one asking for compassion? There's absolutely no denying that forced institutionalization is cruel. Like, really really cruel. You're imprisoning someone in some of the worst conditions possible without them having committed any crime for which they were sentenced to imprisonment. There's loads of people inside neuroatypical communities that flat out deny that it can ever be acceptable for anyone to get institutionalized when they only pose a danger to themselves. That the possibility to a successful suicide is always preferable to forced institutionalization. People that don't know whether they would've killed themselves or not, but say both those outcomes are better than forced institutionalization. Now re-read Kanye's comments about the time he a forced in and tell me you're trying to help him or that you feel any compassion for his plight. Of course he lives in his own world of fame and disorder that pretty much no one can decipher. He's not well, yeah. Forcing him into a closed mental ward is part of what made him worse though. It's pretty much the one thing that makes the most sense."

If it worked, sure we could argue about the merits of going through with it. But since it doesn't work and has been proved to not work for decades now, there's no basis to even entertain the notion that such a thing is possible. 

Heck, West has already been institutionalized against his will once and it didn't work, he just got worse. Why would you think the second attempt would play out any different from the first?"

I was certain at any moment he would yell 'Allah Akbar'. Thankfully, my shopping cart was full of bacon (which as you all know, is Mooslem kryptonite). So I straightened my MAGA hat and pulled up my Confederate flag britches and grabbed a pack of bacon from my cart. I took that Mooslem over my knee and spanked his ass with the bacon while screaming 'Liberalism is a mental disorder!' over and over. Then, by the power of the bacon,  Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul instantly converted to Christianity and registered as a Republican. Trump showed up and awarded me the Medal of Honor because I probably stopped the next 9/11.

1185,2020-08-18 17:28:27,ic5gk6,"Well, I was shopping in Walmart the other day, (with the intent of buying all of their guns, bacon and American flags) when I spotted a Mooslem running frantically up and down through the aisles, and his name was Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul. I was certain at any moment he would yell 'Allah Akbar'. Thankfully, my shopping cart was full of bacon (which as you all know, is Mooslem kryptonite). So I straightened my MAGA hat and pulled up my Confederate flag britches and grabbed a pack of bacon from my cart. I took that Mooslem over my knee and spanked his ass with the bacon while screaming 'Liberalism is a mental disorder!' over and over. Then, by the power of the bacon,  Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul instantly converted to Christianity and registered as a Republican. Trump showed up and awarded me the Medal of Honor because I probably stopped the next 9/11.

1217,2020-08-18 17:11:01,ic541m,"Well, I was shopping in Walmart the other day, (with the intent of buying all of their guns, bacon and American flags) when I spotted a Mooslem running frantically up and down through the aisles, and his name was Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul. I was certain at any moment he would yell 'Allah Akbar'. Thankfully, my shopping cart was full of bacon (which as you all know, is Mooslem kryptonite). So I straightened my MAGA hat and pulled up my Confederate flag britches and grabbed a pack of bacon from my cart. I took that Mooslem over my knee and spanked his ass with the bacon while screaming 'Liberalism is a mental disorder!' over and over. Then, by the power of the bacon,  Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul instantly converted to Christianity and registered as a Republican. Trump showed up and awarded me the Medal of Honor because I probably stopped the next 9/11.

1295,2020-09-02 00:03:49,ikfnvk,"I know that, but I actually like this generational grouping. Makes all generations 18-19 years is very balanced, compared to making it very short as 15-16 or less years or making it very long like 21-22+ years. It makes things easier for everyone else instead of all this confusion. But at the same time, this is all arbitrary. I know that we are not really millennials at the end of the day, especially based on how society views millennials and such, but maybe being a millennial is different to another person.

1298,2020-09-01 07:43:39,ikfnvk,"I dont think ""first who cant possibly remember"" or ""last who can possibly remember"" something are good markers to mark a generation. I mean it is very likely a three or four year old would not remember the political importance of these events. They may not even know who this Kennedy is until like years after he died. 1961 might have memories prior to Kennedy's death.  I am sure many 1959 and 1960 borns would not remember Kennedy's death. Many 1995-1998 dont even remember 9/11. 2015-2017 though can end up remembering a world before coronavirus 15 years from now, even though they may not know what coronavirus is.

1299,2020-09-01 07:52:21,ikfnvk,"Not bad. It's just shifted over four years earlier.

Instead of this:
Boomer: 1946-1964
Gen X: 1965-1983
Gen Y: 1984-2002
Gen Z: 2003-2021

It's this:
Boomer: 1942-1960
Gen X: 1961-1979
Gen Y: 1980-1998
Gen Z: 1999-2017"
1300,2020-09-01 07:58:57,ikfnvk,"The 1961-1979 and 1980-1998 definitions aren't that uncommon actually. Many people want to begin gen y at 1980 since it's the first 80s year, so whenever they also apply the 18 year span, it ends up being 1980-1998. You barely ever see 1942-1960 and 1999-2017 though."
1301,2020-09-01 08:09:10,ikfnvk,"I prefer the ranges next to: instead of this rather than its this. Makes no sense for 1960 to be gatekept from the other two early 60s years. You even said 1980 should be start of millennials since it is the first 80s year. First half of the 60s is gen jones anyways. 

I have seen 1945-1959 as a baby boomer definition. 

Then 1960-1979. 

1980-1999 is one of the most agreeable millennial definitions I have come across. It is my favorite actually. 

I am not keen on when Gen Z ends though.

 [https://www.blissevolution.com/hustle-millennials/](https://www.blissevolution.com/hustle-millennials/)"
1302,2020-09-01 08:02:57,ikfnvk,"1961-1979 is uncommon. I have seen 1960-1979 though with 1946-1959, and even 1960-1980. 1961-1982 is used by just one source though and that uses 1943-1960. I have seen 1998-2016. Never 1999-2017 though. People would prefer stating X in 1960 if 1964 or 1965 is too late, since the first three years of the 60s are the full early 60s years, just like how you said 1980 should be y as it is the first 80s year. People prefer 1982 over 1980 as the millennial start date though."
1303,2020-09-01 08:01:55,ikfnvk,"First of all, I have never seen 1961-1979 and I seen 1942-1960, with the exception of 1942, so 1943-1960. I have seen 1980-1998 (though I feel that most start Y in 1980 cause it is the first 80s year like ending it in 1994 or 1999 for the same numerical reason. I have seen 1999-2017 in a way, maybe excluding 2017, so 1999-2016."
1304,2020-09-01 08:13:16,ikfnvk,"Here's a 1961-1979 one from 2008

[https://careerhub.adelaide.edu.au/students/news/detail/114/generations-at-work](https://careerhub.adelaide.edu.au/students/news/detail/114/generations-at-work)

[https://globalmedia-it.com/USA/millennials-are-not-the-black-sheep-of-generations/](https://globalmedia-it.com/USA/millennials-are-not-the-black-sheep-of-generations/)

It's a definition that will probably never die off, since it begins at 1961 (the second most popular starting point for gen x) and goes all the way to the end of the 70s."

Kanye üôèüèæ West ‚¨Ö is a genius ‚ò∫üòùü§ì and the greatest ‚ò∫ artist üé® of our generation üë∂üë¥. 

Kanye‚Äôs album üíø track üõ§ record üé•üçÜ is almost üí¶ completely üö´ spotless üëø, sporting ‚öΩüèÄüèà the best üèÜ discography in hip üï∫ hop üê∞ of all üíØ time üïê.

***The College üéì Dropout üêª*** 
Kanye's üëë first üëÜ album üíø, he üë®üèæ got üç∏ a deal ü§ù with Jay ü§¨üò°üò§ Z üôÇ and was about üí¶ to finish üèÅ his üí¶ first üëÜ album üé§üíø, then he üë• crashed üê∏üìâ his üëã car üöó after üëÄ a late üí§ recording üé• session üîµüòáüò•. He üë® was very üëå unlikely üò∞ to survive üôèüèºüò©üò≠ but üçëüáÆüáπ was saved üíæ, and had to have his üí¶ entire üé¨ jaw üè∫ redone. He üë® needed üò´ to finish üèÅ his üí¶ album üíø, but üçë he üë• had his üÖ±üí¶ jaw üè∫ closed üö´‚ö†üò§ with a wire üëÄ, so he üë• made üëë the last üòç song üé∂üòç singing üé∂ through the wire üì°üìª. 

***Late üí§ Registration üìù*** 
More of the same, he üë• had a successful üíØ‚úî career üë®üèª‚Äçüíª launch üöÄ and proved himself üò§ with a solid ü§§‚úä jazz üé∑ rap üëå record üé•. Highlights üñå are Roses üåπ and Hey üëã Mama üë©üèø.

***Graduation üéìüîù*** 
One üò§ of the peaks ‚úÖüîùüëåüèª of kanye üôèüèæ hype üòé. Him üë®üèæ and 50cent were fighting üëäüí• to see üëÅ who could get üîü the most album üíø sales üí∏, kanye üôèüèæ beat üëäüèºüí¶ him üë¥ by 3x üíØ the amount üî¢üìâ of sales üí∞. Seemed ü§î like üëç the height üìè of his üí¶ career üë®üèª‚Äçüíª, but üçë that was soon üîú to all üíØ fall üçÇ crumbling down ‚¨á 

***808's and Heartbreak üíî***

She üë© was sent üò≥ back ‚¨Ö home üè° in a critical üòÆüòß state üá∫üá∏, and kanye üôèüèæ was there to say üí¨üë±üèøüíñ his üí¶ goodbyes üëãüñï. This took üë´ a massive üåê toll üíòüíú on üîõ his üëã health ü•ó and caused/affected his üëã divorce üòü. This record üé•üçÜ was made üëâ amidst all üíØ of his üí¶ grief üí£. It is commonly üê© referred üìñ to as one üë∫‚òù of the most influential üåé records üé• of our generation üòéüëåüèæüíØ, as it sparked the new üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüÜï generation üë∂üèº of rappers üé§.

Holy üôè shit üí© holy üôè‚õ™ shit üí© holy üôè shit üí©. After üëÄ releasing his üí¶ last üòç album üíø, 808's and hearbreak, to lukewarm ü•µ critic üòÆüòß reception üì≤, kanye üôèüèæ took üë´ it personally üë¶üëßüë®.

A lot üíØ of drama üé≠ and a lot üçë of shit üí©üñïüèæ going üèÉüë≥ on üîõ in his üí¶ life üë§ spurred him üë¥ to completely üö´ remove ‚ùå social üë• media üí¶ from his üëãüèº life üíì, and he üë• went üí® off üì¥ to hawaii üå∏üå¥üõ¨ to isolate üíØüëçüëå himself üò§. MBDTF ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è is one ‚òù of the best üíâüíäüëå albums üíø of all üíØ time üïê in my opinion üò§, the best üëåüíØ hiphop üé§ album üíøüíΩüìÄ of all üíØ time üïê, and it was extremely üçÜ critically üè• acclaimed. 

***Yeezus üíΩ*** 
After 2Ô∏è‚É£ releasing a legendary üò®üòß album üíøüíΩüìÄ, kanye üôèüèæ had all üíØ eyes üëÄ on üîõ him üë®.

He üë® married üë∞üèº kim üÜó kardashian üòÇ around üîÉ this time üïê.

He üë® spent üòµ most of his üí¶ album-making time üïêüïü there, and during his üí¶ stay üíí, kim üëç kardashian üòÇ was kidnapped ü§úüí•üî™ and robbed üèÉüèøüôéüèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüéÅ at gunpoint. This spurred a whole üí¶ lot üçë of anger üò° and confusion ü§îü§® in him üë¥, causing üòéüí¶ him üë®üëäüò° to make üñï one ‚òù of the best üëå and weirdest üòòüçë hip-hop üéßüîü albums ü•≥üíøüìÄ to this date üìÜüÖ∞.

Kanye‚Äôs album üíø track üõ§ record üé•üçÜ is almost üí¶ completely üö´ spotless üëø, sporting ‚öΩüèÄüèà the best üèÜ discography in hip üï∫ hop üê∞ of all üíØ time üïê.

***The College üéì Dropout üêª*** Kanye's üëë first üëÜ album üíø, he üë®üèæ got üç∏ a deal ü§ù with Jay ü§¨üò°üò§ Z üôÇ and was about üí¶ to finish üèÅ his üí¶ first üëÜ album üé§üíø, then he üë• crashed üê∏üìâ his üëã car üöó after üëÄ a late üí§ recording üé• session üîµüòáüò•. He üë® was very üëå unlikely üò∞ to survive üôèüèºüò©üò≠ but üçëüáÆüáπ was saved üíæ, and had to have his üí¶ entire üé¨ jaw üè∫ redone.

***Late üí§ Registration üìù*** More of the same, he üë• had a successful üíØ‚úî career üë®üèª‚Äçüíª launch üöÄ and proved himself üò§ with a solid ü§§‚úä jazz üé∑ rap üëå record üé•.

***Graduation üéìüîù*** One üò§ of the peaks ‚úÖüîùüëåüèª of kanye üôèüèæ hype üòé. Him üë®üèæ and 50cent were fighting üëäüí• to see üëÅ who could get üîü the most album üíø sales üí∏, kanye üôèüèæ beat üëäüèºüí¶ him üë¥ by 3x üíØ the amount üî¢üìâ of sales üí∞.

***808's and Heartbreak üíî*** Kanye's üë®üèø mother üëµ, Donda West üåé, wanted üòç to get üâê a cosmetic üëÄüëë breast ‚öΩ reduction üòí surgery üíäüíâüò´.

This took üë´ a massive üåê toll üíòüíú on üîõ his üëã health ü•ó and caused/affected his üëã divorce üòü. This record üé•üçÜ was made üëâ amidst all üíØ of his üí¶ grief üí£.

MBDTF ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è is one ‚òù of the best üíâüíäüëå albums üíø of all üíØ time üïê in my opinion üò§, the best üëåüíØ hiphop üé§ album üíøüíΩüìÄ of all üíØ time üïê, and it was extremely üçÜ critically üè• acclaimed.

***Yeezus üíΩ*** After 2Ô∏è‚É£ releasing a legendary üò®üòß album üíøüíΩüìÄ, kanye üôèüèæ had all üíØ eyes üëÄ on üîõ him üë®.

1373,2020-10-02 13:47:54,j3urol,"Kanye üôèüèæ West ‚¨Ö is a genius ‚ò∫üòùü§ì and the greatest ‚ò∫ artist üé® of our generation üë∂üë¥. 

Kanye‚Äôs album üíø track üõ§ record üé•üçÜ is almost üí¶ completely üö´ spotless üëø, sporting ‚öΩüèÄüèà the best üèÜ discography in hip üï∫ hop üê∞ of all üíØ time üïê. Here‚Äôs a rundown of most Kanye üôèüèæ albums üíø and why ‚Åâü§î they‚Äôre masterpieces üñä. I üëÅ cannot üö´ do them enough üí¶ justice ‚öñ through text üì±üìñ so I üëÅ suggest üëÄ you üëà listen üëÇ‚úÖ to them. 

***The College üéì Dropout üêª*** 
Kanye's üëë first üëÜ album üíø, he üë®üèæ got üç∏ a deal ü§ù with Jay ü§¨üò°üò§ Z üôÇ and was about üí¶ to finish üèÅ his üí¶ first üëÜ album üé§üíø, then he üë• crashed üê∏üìâ his üëã car üöó after üëÄ a late üí§ recording üé• session üîµüòáüò•. He üë® was very üëå unlikely üò∞ to survive üôèüèºüò©üò≠ but üçëüáÆüáπ was saved üíæ, and had to have his üí¶ entire üé¨ jaw üè∫ redone. He üë® needed üò´ to finish üèÅ his üí¶ album üíø, but üçë he üë• had his üÖ±üí¶ jaw üè∫ closed üö´‚ö†üò§ with a wire üëÄ, so he üë• made üëë the last üòç song üé∂üòç singing üé∂ through the wire üì°üìª. 

***Late üí§ Registration üìù*** 
More of the same, he üë• had a successful üíØ‚úî career üë®üèª‚Äçüíª launch üöÄ and proved himself üò§ with a solid ü§§‚úä jazz üé∑ rap üëå record üé•. Highlights üñå are Roses üåπ and Hey üëã Mama üë©üèø. Hey üëã Mama üëµ was a sweet üç≠ song üé∂ dedicated üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è to his üí¶ mother üòÇüë©, which he üë• considered ü§î his üí¶ best üëå friend üë¨. 

***Graduation üéìüîù*** 
One üò§ of the peaks ‚úÖüîùüëåüèª of kanye üôèüèæ hype üòé.

***808's and Heartbreak üíî***

Kanye üôèüèæ paid üí∞üí∏ for it, and she üë© died üíÄ due ‚òëüîò to malpractice and failure üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ùåüò≠ to comply üòÅ with safety üîí regulations üòÇü§£üòç. She üë© was sent üò≥ back ‚¨Ö home üè° in a critical üòÆüòß state üá∫üá∏, and kanye üôèüèæ was there to say üí¨üë±üèøüíñ his üí¶ goodbyes üëãüñï. This took üë´ a massive üåê toll üíòüíú on üîõ his üëã health ü•ó and caused/affected his üëã divorce üòü. This record üé•üçÜ was made üëâ amidst all üíØ of his üí¶ grief üí£. It is commonly üê© referred üìñ to as one üë∫‚òù of the most influential üåé records üé• of our generation üòéüëåüèæüíØ, as it sparked the new üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüÜï generation üë∂üèº of rappers üé§.

MBDTF ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è is one ‚òù of the best üíâüíäüëå albums üíø of all üíØ time üïê in my opinion üò§, the best üëåüíØ hiphop üé§ album üíøüíΩüìÄ of all üíØ time üïê, and it was extremely üçÜ critically üè• acclaimed. 

***Yeezus üíΩ***

He üë® married üë∞üèº kim üÜó kardashian üòÇ around üîÉ this time üïê.

Kanye üôèüèæ West ‚¨Ö is a genius ‚ò∫üòùü§ì and the greatest ‚ò∫ artist üé® of our generation üë∂üë¥. 

Kanye‚Äôs album üíø track üõ§ record üé•üçÜ is almost üí¶ completely üö´ spotless üëø, sporting ‚öΩüèÄüèà the best üèÜ discography in hip üï∫ hop üê∞ of all üíØ time üïê. Here‚Äôs a rundown of most Kanye üôèüèæ albums üíø and why ‚Åâü§î they‚Äôre masterpieces üñä. I üëÅ cannot üö´ do them enough üí¶ justice ‚öñ through text üì±üìñ so I üëÅ suggest üëÄ you üëà listen üëÇ‚úÖ to them. 

***The College üéì Dropout üêª*** 
Kanye's üëë first üëÜ album üíø, he üë®üèæ got üç∏ a deal ü§ù with Jay ü§¨üò°üò§ Z üôÇ and was about üí¶ to finish üèÅ his üí¶ first üëÜ album üé§üíø, then he üë• crashed üê∏üìâ his üëã car üöó after üëÄ a late üí§ recording üé• session üîµüòáüò•. He üë® was very üëå unlikely üò∞ to survive üôèüèºüò©üò≠ but üçëüáÆüáπ was saved üíæ, and had to have his üí¶ entire üé¨ jaw üè∫ redone. He üë® needed üò´ to finish üèÅ his üí¶ album üíø, but üçë he üë• had his üÖ±üí¶ jaw üè∫ closed üö´‚ö†üò§ with a wire üëÄ, so he üë• made üëë the last üòç song üé∂üòç singing üé∂ through the wire üì°üìª. 

***Late üí§ Registration üìù*** 
More of the same, he üë• had a successful üíØ‚úî career üë®üèª‚Äçüíª launch üöÄ and proved himself üò§ with a solid ü§§‚úä jazz üé∑ rap üëå record üé•. Highlights üñå are Roses üåπ and Hey üëã Mama üë©üèø. Hey üëã Mama üëµ was a sweet üç≠ song üé∂ dedicated üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è to his üí¶ mother üòÇüë©, which he üë• considered ü§î his üí¶ best üëå friend üë¨. 

***Graduation üéìüîù*** 
One üò§ of the peaks ‚úÖüîùüëåüèª of kanye üôèüèæ hype üòé. Him üë®üèæ and 50cent were fighting üëäüí• to see üëÅ who could get üîü the most album üíø sales üí∏, kanye üôèüèæ beat üëäüèºüí¶ him üë¥ by 3x üíØ the amount üî¢üìâ of sales üí∞. Seemed ü§î like üëç the height üìè of his üí¶ career üë®üèª‚Äçüíª, but üçë that was soon üîú to all üíØ fall üçÇ crumbling down ‚¨á 

***808's and Heartbreak üíî*** 
Kanye's üë®üèø mother üëµ, Donda West üåé, wanted üòç to get üâê a cosmetic üëÄüëë breast ‚öΩ reduction üòí surgery üíäüíâüò´. Kanye üôèüèæ paid üí∞üí∏ for it, and she üë© died üíÄ due ‚òëüîò to malpractice and failure üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ùåüò≠ to comply üòÅ with safety üîí regulations üòÇü§£üòç. She üë© was sent üò≥ back ‚¨Ö home üè° in a critical üòÆüòß state üá∫üá∏, and kanye üôèüèæ was there to say üí¨üë±üèøüíñ his üí¶ goodbyes üëãüñï. This took üë´ a massive üåê toll üíòüíú on üîõ his üëã health ü•ó and caused/affected his üëã divorce üòü. This record üé•üçÜ was made üëâ amidst all üíØ of his üí¶ grief üí£. It is commonly üê© referred üìñ to as one üë∫‚òù of the most influential üåé records üé• of our generation üòéüëåüèæüíØ, as it sparked the new üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüÜï generation üë∂üèº of rappers üé§. 

***My Beautiful üåÑ Dark üåö Twisted ü•Ä Fantasy üò¥*** 
Holy üôè shit üí© holy üôè‚õ™ shit üí© holy üôè shit üí©. After üëÄ releasing his üí¶ last üòç album üíø, 808's and hearbreak, to lukewarm ü•µ critic üòÆüòß reception üì≤, kanye üôèüèæ took üë´ it personally üë¶üëßüë®. He üë®üöπ had earlier üïî gone üèÉ on üîõ stage 4Ô∏è‚É£üíñ during the VMA's üìπüèÜ and claimed üîë that taylor üë∏ swift üèÉ did not deserve ü§¥ her üë© award üèÜüèÅ. A lot üíØ of drama üé≠ and a lot üçë of shit üí©üñïüèæ going üèÉüë≥ on üîõ in his üí¶ life üë§ spurred him üë¥ to completely üö´ remove ‚ùå social üë• media üí¶ from his üëãüèº life üíì, and he üë• went üí® off üì¥ to hawaii üå∏üå¥üõ¨ to isolate üíØüëçüëå himself üò§. MBDTF ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è is one ‚òù of the best üíâüíäüëå albums üíø of all üíØ time üïê in my opinion üò§, the best üëåüíØ hiphop üé§ album üíøüíΩüìÄ of all üíØ time üïê, and it was extremely üçÜ critically üè• acclaimed. 

***Yeezus üíΩ*** 
After 2Ô∏è‚É£ releasing a legendary üò®üòß album üíøüíΩüìÄ, kanye üôèüèæ had all üíØ eyes üëÄ on üîõ him üë®. Everybody üë¥üëµüë® expected ü§ï him üë¥ to make üíò something üòÖ to the style üòé of MBDTF ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, and he ‚öñüë• wanted üòç to subvert expectations üòÄüòÉ. He üë® married üë∞üèº kim üÜó kardashian üòÇ around üîÉ this time üïê. Kanye üôèüèæ decided ‚úåüèª to move üöö himself üò§ to the center üè¢‚úà of the fashion üé© industry üí¶üè≠‚úã, france üá´üá∑. He üë® spent üòµ most of his üí¶ album-making time üïêüïü there, and during his üí¶ stay üíí, kim üëç kardashian üòÇ was kidnapped ü§úüí•üî™ and robbed üèÉüèøüôéüèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüéÅ at gunpoint. This spurred a whole üí¶ lot üçë of anger üò° and confusion ü§îü§® in him üë¥, causing üòéüí¶ him üë®üëäüò° to make üñï one ‚òù of the best üëå and weirdest üòòüçë hip-hop üéßüîü albums ü•≥üíøüìÄ to this date üìÜüÖ∞. Yeezus üíΩ has a lot üçë of industrial üè≠ and noise üîä elements ‚öó, and it is a very ‚úÖ angry üò°üò§ album üíøüíΩüìÄ. A lot üíØüî• of people üë´ did not see üëÄ the vision üëÄ in this album üíø at first ü•á, resulting in a lukewarm ü•µ reaction üóëüôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è at first üëÜ. Later üïë down üîª the line ‚ûñ yeezus üëë has begun ‚ñ∂ to be praised üòç for it's forward-thinking production üòÇ and shit üí©üñïüèæ, and now it's considered ü§î one üë∫‚òù of his üí¶ best üëåüèºüòú albums üíø. 

***The Life üë§ of Pablo ‚ú¥üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶üôáüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è*** 
After üèªüëÄ Yeezus üíΩ, kanye üôèüèæ decided üëØ to calm üòå the fuck üëâ down ‚¨á. He üë®üë©üë¥ said üí¨üôà he üë• was working üè¢üîõ on üîõüáÆüáπ gospel üë£üëºüèªüëáüèø music üé∂, and then he üë® just released üëÅ a hiphop üéßüîü album üíø and pretended it was gospel üîõ. It incorporated a lot üçë‚Äº of elements ‚öó of gospel üóûüì∞, but üçë it's still üôÑüòΩ a kanye üë®üèø album üíøüíΩüìÄ. This album üíø recieved üíÄ bad üëé‚ùìüò° reactions üóëüôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è at first üëÜ, and kanye üôèüèæ did not like üíñ this, so he ‚ù§üë• just straight üìè up ‚òù redid the entire üé¨ album üíø, and the rework was recieved üíÄ extremely üíØ well üò¶ by critics üòÆüòß and fans ü§° alike üëàüòé. The rework included üë® ""saint üëº pablo ‚ú¥üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶üôáüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"", one 1Ô∏è‚É£ of kanye's üëë most legendary üò∞ songs üé∂ due üôè to it's intensely üéÜüåüüí• personal üë´ message üí¨üñ•‚å® and callbacks to his üí¶ roots üòè. 

**Ye üëπ** 
Kanye's üíÉ bipolar üíàüò´ was acting üé≠ up ‚òù like üòÑ never üôÖ before üòÇ, and during one 1Ô∏è‚É£ of his üí¶ highs ‚¨Ü he üë® made üëë his üí¶ infamous üò∞üò§üëø slavery üíã‚õì comment üí¨. During this time üïê, he üë® also üë® started üÜï praising üôå trump üëë and doing a bunch üíêüçáüçí of overall üòåüß† crazy ü§™ and out-of-character shit üí©.

Kanye üôèüèæ West ‚¨Ö is a genius ‚ò∫üòùü§ì and the greatest ‚ò∫ artist üé® of our generation üë∂üë¥. 

Kanye‚Äôs album üíø track üõ§ record üé•üçÜ is almost üí¶ completely üö´ spotless üëø, sporting ‚öΩüèÄüèà the best üèÜ discography in hip üï∫ hop üê∞ of all üíØ time üïê.

***The College üéì Dropout üêª***

***Late üí§ Registration üìù*** 
More of the same, he üë• had a successful üíØ‚úî career üë®üèª‚Äçüíª launch üöÄ and proved himself üò§ with a solid ü§§‚úä jazz üé∑ rap üëå record üé•.

1386,2020-10-02 09:04:08,j3r978,"Kanye West is a genius and the greatest artist of our generation.

Kanye‚Äôs album track record is almost completely spotless, sporting the best discography in hip hop of all time. Here‚Äôs a rundown of most Kanye albums and why they‚Äôre masterpieces. I cannot do them enough justice through text so I suggest you listen to them.
***The College Dropout***
Kanye's first album, he got a deal with Jay Z and was about to finish his first album, then he crashed his car after a late recording session. He was very unlikely to survive but was saved, and had to have his entire jaw redone. He needed to finish his album, but he had his jaw closed with a wire, so he made the last song singing through the wire.
***Late Registration***
More of the same, he had a successful career launch and proved himself with a solid jazz rap record. Highlights are Roses and Hey Mama. Hey Mama was a sweet song dedicated to his mother, which he considered his best friend.
***Graduation***
One of the peaks of kanye hype. Him and 50cent were fighting to see who could get the most album sales, kanye beat him by 3x the amount of sales. Seemed like the height of his career, but that was soon to all fall crumbling down
***808's and Heartbreak***
Kanye's mother, Donda West, wanted to get a cosmetic breast reduction surgery. Kanye paid for it, and she died due to malpractice and failure to comply with safety regulations. She was sent back home in a critical state, and kanye was there to say his goodbyes. This took a massive toll on his health and caused/affected his divorce. This record was made amidst all of his grief. It is commonly referred to as one of the most influential records of our generation, as it sparked the new generation of rappers.
***My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy***
Holy shit holy shit holy shit. After releasing his last album, 808's and hearbreak, to lukewarm critic reception, kanye took it personally. He had earlier gone on stage during the VMA's and claimed that taylor swift did not deserve her award. A lot of drama and a lot of shit going on in his life spurred him to completely remove social media from his life, and he went off to hawaii to isolate himself. MBDTF is one of the best albums of all time in my opinion, the best hiphop album of all time, and it was extremely critically acclaimed.
***Yeezus***
After releasing a legendary album, kanye had all eyes on him. Everybody expected him to make something to the style of MBDTF, and he wanted to subvert expectations. He married kim kardashian around this time. Kanye decided to move himself to the center of the fashion industry, france. He spent most of his album-making time there, and during his stay, kim kardashian was kidnapped and robbed at gunpoint. This spurred a whole lot of anger and confusion in him, causing him to make one of the best and weirdest hip-hop albums to this date. Yeezus has a lot of industrial and noise elements, and it is a very angry album. A lot of people did not see the vision in this album at first, resulting in a lukewarm reaction at first. Later down the line yeezus has begun to be praised for it's forward-thinking production and shit, and now it's considered one of his best albums.
***The Life of Pablo***
After Yeezus, kanye decided to calm the fuck down. He said he was working on gospel music, and then he just released a hiphop album and pretended it was gospel. It incorporated a lot of elements of gospel, but it's still a kanye album. This album recieved bad reactions at first, and kanye did not like this, so he just straight up redid the entire album, and the rework was recieved extremely well by critics and fans alike. The rework included ""saint pablo"", one of kanye's most legendary songs due to it's intensely personal message and callbacks to his roots.
**Ye**
Kanye's bipolar was acting up like never before, and during one of his highs he made his infamous slavery comment. During this time, he also started praising trump and doing a bunch of overall crazy and out-of-character shit. Ye goes into kanye's deepest insecurities and thoughts, and targets them head-on.
***Kids See Ghosts***
amazing album, it was a collaboration between kid cudi and kanye. basically Ye on sterroids. Kanye and Cudi were attempting to make ""music therapy"", and they were really fucking successful at it. Some of kanye's smartest lyrics in this album, such as ""all of y'all mario, it's all a game"" (mario is an anagram of Omari, which is kanye's middle name. this shifts the lyric completely, and gives it a double meaning, he's basically just saying that everyone in the rap game in the current year is copying his 808's and yeezus shit, and that it's just what the industry wants)
Please, if you haven‚Äôt, listen to MBDTF, one of the greatest albums of all time."

***Yeezus***
Aftew weweasing a wegendawy awbum, kanye had aww eyes on him. Evewybody expected him to make something to the stywe of MBDTF, and he wanted to subvewt expectations. He mawwied kim kawdashian awound this time. Kanye decided to move himsewf to the centew of the fashion industwy, fwance. He spent most of his awbum-making time thewe, and duwing his stay, kim kawdashian was kidnapped and wobbed at gunpoint. This spuwwed a whowe wot of angew and confusion in him, causing him to make one of the best and weiwdest hip-hop awbums to this date. Yeezus has a wot of industwiaw and noise ewements, and it is a vewy angwy awbum. A wot of peopwe did not see the vision in this awbum at fiwst, wesuwting in a wukewawm weaction at fiwst. Watew down the wine yeezus has begun to be pwaised fow it's fowwawd-thinking pwoduction and shit, and now it's considewed one of his best awbums.
***The Wife of Pabwo***
Aftew Yeezus, kanye decided to cawm the fuck down. He said he was wowking on gospew music, and then he just weweased a hiphop awbum and pwetended it was gospew. It incowpowated a wot of ewements of gospew, but it's stiww a kanye awbum. This awbum wecieved bad weactions at fiwst, and kanye did not wike this, so he just stwaight up wedid the entiwe awbum, and the wewowk was wecieved extwemewy weww by cwitics and fans awike. The wewowk incwuded ""saint pabwo"", one of kanye's most wegendawy songs due to it's intensewy pewsonaw message and cawwbacks to his woots.
**Ye**
Kanye's bipowaw was acting up wike nevew befowe, and duwing one of his highs he made his infamous swavewy comment. Duwing this time, he awso stawted pwaising twump and doing a bunch of ovewaww cwazy and out-of-chawactew shit. Ye goes into kanye's deepest insecuwities and thoughts, and tawgets them head-on.
***Kids See Ghosts***
amazing awbum, it was a cowwabowation between kid cudi and kanye. basicawwy Ye on stewwoids. Kanye and Cudi wewe attempting to make ""music thewapy"", and they wewe weawwy fucking successfuw at it. Some of kanye's smawtest wywics in this awbum, such as ""aww of y'aww mawio, it's aww a game"" (mawio is an anagwam of Omawi, which is kanye's middwe name. this shifts the wywic compwetewy, and gives it a doubwe meaning, he's basicawwy just saying that evewyone in the wap game in the cuwwent yeaw is copying his 808's and yeezus shit, and that it's just what the industwy wants)
Pwease, if you haven‚Äôt, wisten to MBDTF, one of the gweatest awbums of aww time."

Holy üôè shit üëçüëå holy ‚úù shit üí© holy ‚úù shit üí©üëÄüèø.

He üë® had earlier üïî gone üèÉ on üîõ stage üëÑ during the VMA's üìπüèÜ and claimed üé∫ that taylor üëñüëïüßµ swift üèÉüèªüôè did not deserve üëå her üë© award üèÖ. A lot üíØ of drama üé≠ and a lot üçë of shit üôáüí©üöΩ going üèÉ on üîõ in his üí¶ life üë§ spurred him üë®üèæ to completely üö´ remove ‚ùå social üë®üë• media üí¶ from his üí¶ life üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíì, and he üë¥üôãüë• went üèÉüèá off üì¥ to hawaii üå∏üå¥üõ¨ to isolate üò¢üôé‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è himself ü§ñüôÖ. MBDTF ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è is one üò§üëº of the best üëåüíØ albums üíøüò≠ of all üíØ time ‚è∞ in my opinion üò§, the best üëåüíØ hiphop üéßüîü album üíΩ of all üíØ time üïê‚è∞, and it was extremely üíØ critically üè• acclaimed. 
***Yeezus üíΩ*** 
After üëÄ releasing a legendary üò∞ album üíø, kanye üôèüèæ had all üíØ eyes üëÄ on üîõ him üë¥. Everybody üë¥üëµüë® expected ü§ï him üë® to make üñï something üòÖ to the style üòé of MBDTF ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, and he üë• wanted üòç to subvert expectations ü§ó. He üë® married üéâ kim üëç kardashian üòÇ around üß±üé∂üéµ this time ‚è∞. Kanye üôèüèæ decided üëØ to move üì¶ himself ü§ñüôÖ to the center ‚≠ï of the fashion üßêüé© industry üè≠, france üó∫. He üë® spent üíµ most of his üí¶ album-making time ‚è∞2Ô∏è‚É£ there, and during his üí¶ stay üíí, kim üÜó kardashian üòÇ was kidnapped ü§úüí•üî™ and robbed üî´ at gunpoint. This spurred a whole üí¶üëÖ lot üíØ of anger üò° and confusion ‚ùìüòíü§î in him üë¥, causing üòéüí¶ him üë¥ to make üñï one üë∫‚òù of the best üëå and weirdest üòòüçë hip-hop üéßüîü albums üíø to this date üìÜ. Yeezus üëë has a lot üíØ of industrial üè≠ and noise üîä elements üí¶üî•üåé, and it is a very üèΩ‚úÖ angry üò° album üíΩ. A lot üçë of people üë® did not see üëÄ the vision üëÄ in this album üíΩ at first ü•á, resulting in a lukewarm ü•µ reaction üò≤ at first ü•á‚òù.

***The Life üë§ of Pablo ‚ú¥üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶üôáüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è*** 
After 2Ô∏è‚É£ Yeezus ‚ùìüêª, kanye üôèüèæ decided üëØ to calm üò¥ the fuck üñï down üîª. He üë®üèΩ said üë±üèøüí¨üôà he üòèüë® was working üò©üò´üí™ on üîõ gospel üîõ music üéºüéµüé∏, and then he üë® just released üòéüí¶ a hiphop üé§ album üíøüíΩüìÄ and pretended it was gospel üîõ. It incorporated a lot üçë of elements ‚öó of gospel ‚úâ, but üçë it's still üôÑ a kanye üôèüèæ album üíΩ. This album üíø recieved üíÄ bad üëé reactions üóëüôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è at first ü•á, and kanye üôèüèæ did not like üíñ this, so he üë® just straight üìè up ‚¨Üüí¶ redid the entire üé¨ album üíΩüé∂, and the rework was recieved üíÄ extremely üçÜ well üò¶ by critics üòÆüòß and fans ü§° alike üëàüòé. The rework included üë® ""saint üëº pablo ‚ú¥üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶üôáüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"", one ‚òù of kanye's üë®üèø most legendary üò∞ songs üé∂üéµ due ‚òëüîò to it's intensely üí•üî• personal üë´ message ‚úâ and callbacks to his üí¶ roots üòè. 
**Ye üëπ** 
Kanye's üë®üèø bipolar üíà was acting üé≠ up ‚¨Ü like üëç never ‚ùå before üòÇ, and during one ‚òù of his üí¶ highs üïõ he üë® made üëë his üëãüèª infamous üò∞üò§üëø slavery ‚õìüîóüò§ comment üó£.

***Wate Wegistwation***
Mowe of the same, he had a successfuw caweew waunch and pwoved himsewf with a sowid jazz wap wecowd. Highwights awe Woses and Hey Mama. Hey Mama was a sweet song dedicated to his mothew, which he considewed his best fwiend.
***Gwaduation***
One of the peaks of kanye hype. Him and 50cent wewe fighting to see who couwd get the most awbum sawes, kanye beat him by 3x the amount of sawes. Seemed wike the height of his caweew, but that was soon to aww faww cwumbwing down

She was sent back home in a cwiticaw state, and kanye was thewe to say his goodbyes. This took a massive toww on his heawth and caused/affected his divowce.

Howy shit howy shit howy shit. Aftew weweasing his wast awbum, 808's and heawbweak, to wukewawm cwitic weception, kanye took it pewsonawwy.

A wot of dwama and a wot of shit going on in his wife spuwwed him to compwetewy wemove sociaw media fwom his wife, and he went off to hawaii to isowate himsewf. MBDTF is one of the best awbums of aww time in my opinion, the best hiphop awbum of aww time, and it was extwemewy cwiticawwy accwaimed.
***Yeezus***
Aftew weweasing a wegendawy awbum, kanye had aww eyes on him. Evewybody expected him to make something to the stywe of MBDTF, and he wanted to subvewt expectations.

***The Wife of Pabwo***
Aftew Yeezus, kanye decided to cawm the fuck down. He said he was wowking on gospew music, and then he just weweased a hiphop awbum and pwetended it was gospew.

Pwease, if you haven‚Äôt, wisten to MBDTF, one of the gweatest awbums of aww time."
1395,2020-10-02 08:00:52,j3qkn9,"Kanye West is a genius and the greatest artist of our generation.

Kanye‚Äôs album track record is almost completely spotless, sporting the best discography in hip hop of all time. Here‚Äôs a rundown of most Kanye albums and why they‚Äôre masterpieces. I cannot do them enough justice through text so I suggest you listen to them.
***The College Dropout***
Kanye's first album, he got a deal with Jay Z and was about to finish his first album, then he crashed his car after a late recording session. He was very unlikely to survive but was saved, and had to have his entire jaw redone. He needed to finish his album, but he had his jaw closed with a wire, so he made the last song singing through the wire.
***Late Registration***
More of the same, he had a successful career launch and proved himself with a solid jazz rap record. Highlights are Roses and Hey Mama. Hey Mama was a sweet song dedicated to his mother, which he considered his best friend.
***Graduation***
One of the peaks of kanye hype. Him and 50cent were fighting to see who could get the most album sales, kanye beat him by 3x the amount of sales. Seemed like the height of his career, but that was soon to all fall crumbling down
***808's and Heartbreak***
Kanye's mother, Donda West, wanted to get a cosmetic breast reduction surgery. Kanye paid for it, and she died due to malpractice and failure to comply with safety regulations. She was sent back home in a critical state, and kanye was there to say his goodbyes. This took a massive toll on his health and caused/affected his divorce. This record was made amidst all of his grief. It is commonly referred to as one of the most influential records of our generation, as it sparked the new generation of rappers.
***My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy***
Holy shit holy shit holy shit. After releasing his last album, 808's and hearbreak, to lukewarm critic reception, kanye took it personally. He had earlier gone on stage during the VMA's and claimed that taylor swift did not deserve her award. A lot of drama and a lot of shit going on in his life spurred him to completely remove social media from his life, and he went off to hawaii to isolate himself. MBDTF is one of the best albums of all time in my opinion, the best hiphop album of all time, and it was extremely critically acclaimed.
***Yeezus***
After releasing a legendary album, kanye had all eyes on him. Everybody expected him to make something to the style of MBDTF, and he wanted to subvert expectations. He married kim kardashian around this time. Kanye decided to move himself to the center of the fashion industry, france. He spent most of his album-making time there, and during his stay, kim kardashian was kidnapped and robbed at gunpoint. This spurred a whole lot of anger and confusion in him, causing him to make one of the best and weirdest hip-hop albums to this date. Yeezus has a lot of industrial and noise elements, and it is a very angry album. A lot of people did not see the vision in this album at first, resulting in a lukewarm reaction at first. Later down the line yeezus has begun to be praised for it's forward-thinking production and shit, and now it's considered one of his best albums.
***The Life of Pablo***
After Yeezus, kanye decided to calm the fuck down. He said he was working on gospel music, and then he just released a hiphop album and pretended it was gospel. It incorporated a lot of elements of gospel, but it's still a kanye album. This album recieved bad reactions at first, and kanye did not like this, so he just straight up redid the entire album, and the rework was recieved extremely well by critics and fans alike. The rework included ""saint pablo"", one of kanye's most legendary songs due to it's intensely personal message and callbacks to his roots.
**Ye**
Kanye's bipolar was acting up like never before, and during one of his highs he made his infamous slavery comment. During this time, he also started praising trump and doing a bunch of overall crazy and out-of-character shit. Ye goes into kanye's deepest insecurities and thoughts, and targets them head-on.
***Kids See Ghosts***
amazing album, it was a collaboration between kid cudi and kanye. basically Ye on sterroids. Kanye and Cudi were attempting to make ""music therapy"", and they were really fucking successful at it. Some of kanye's smartest lyrics in this album, such as ""all of y'all mario, it's all a game"" (mario is an anagram of Omari, which is kanye's middle name. this shifts the lyric completely, and gives it a double meaning, he's basically just saying that everyone in the rap game in the current year is copying his 808's and yeezus shit, and that it's just what the industry wants)
Please, if you haven‚Äôt, listen to MBDTF, one of the greatest albums of all time."

Some of kanye's smawtest wywics in this awbum, such as ""aww of y'aww mawio, it's aww a game"" (mawio is an anagwam of Omawi, which is kanye's middwe name. this shifts the wywic compwetewy, and gives it a doubwe meaning, he's basicawwy just saying that evewyone in the wap game in the cuwwent yeaw is copying his 808's and yeezus shit, and that it's just what the industwy wants)
Pwease, if you haven‚Äôt, wisten to MBDTF, one of the gweatest awbums of aww time."
1400,2020-10-02 07:38:04,j3qc5q,"Kanye‚Äôs album track record is almost completely spotless, sporting the best discography in hip hop of all time. Here‚Äôs a rundown of most Kanye albums and why they‚Äôre masterpieces. I cannot do them enough justice through text so I suggest you listen to them.
***The College Dropout***
Kanye's first album, he got a deal with Jay Z and was about to finish his first album, then he crashed his car after a late recording session. He was very unlikely to survive but was saved, and had to have his entire jaw redone. He needed to finish his album, but he had his jaw closed with a wire, so he made the last song singing through the wire.
***Late Registration***
More of the same, he had a successful career launch and proved himself with a solid jazz rap record. Highlights are Roses and Hey Mama. Hey Mama was a sweet song dedicated to his mother, which he considered his best friend.
***Graduation***
One of the peaks of kanye hype. Him and 50cent were fighting to see who could get the most album sales, kanye beat him by 3x the amount of sales. Seemed like the height of his career, but that was soon to all fall crumbling down
***808's and Heartbreak***
Kanye's mother, Donda West, wanted to get a cosmetic breast reduction surgery. Kanye paid for it, and she died due to malpractice and failure to comply with safety regulations. She was sent back home in a critical state, and kanye was there to say his goodbyes. This took a massive toll on his health and caused/affected his divorce. This record was made amidst all of his grief. It is commonly referred to as one of the most influential records of our generation, as it sparked the new generation of rappers.
***My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy***
Holy shit holy shit holy shit. After releasing his last album, 808's and hearbreak, to lukewarm critic reception, kanye took it personally. He had earlier gone on stage during the VMA's and claimed that taylor swift did not deserve her award. A lot of drama and a lot of shit going on in his life spurred him to completely remove social media from his life, and he went off to hawaii to isolate himself. MBDTF is one of the best albums of all time in my opinion, the best hiphop album of all time, and it was extremely critically acclaimed.
***Yeezus***
After releasing a legendary album, kanye had all eyes on him. Everybody expected him to make something to the style of MBDTF, and he wanted to subvert expectations. He married kim kardashian around this time. Kanye decided to move himself to the center of the fashion industry, france. He spent most of his album-making time there, and during his stay, kim kardashian was kidnapped and robbed at gunpoint. This spurred a whole lot of anger and confusion in him, causing him to make one of the best and weirdest hip-hop albums to this date. Yeezus has a lot of industrial and noise elements, and it is a very angry album. A lot of people did not see the vision in this album at first, resulting in a lukewarm reaction at first. Later down the line yeezus has begun to be praised for it's forward-thinking production and shit, and now it's considered one of his best albums.
***The Life of Pablo***
After Yeezus, kanye decided to calm the fuck down. He said he was working on gospel music, and then he just released a hiphop album and pretended it was gospel. It incorporated a lot of elements of gospel, but it's still a kanye album. This album recieved bad reactions at first, and kanye did not like this, so he just straight up redid the entire album, and the rework was recieved extremely well by critics and fans alike. The rework included ""saint pablo"", one of kanye's most legendary songs due to it's intensely personal message and callbacks to his roots.
**Ye**
Kanye's bipolar was acting up like never before, and during one of his highs he made his infamous slavery comment. During this time, he also started praising trump and doing a bunch of overall crazy and out-of-character shit. Ye goes into kanye's deepest insecurities and thoughts, and targets them head-on.
***Kids See Ghosts***
amazing album, it was a collaboration between kid cudi and kanye. basically Ye on sterroids. Kanye and Cudi were attempting to make ""music therapy"", and they were really fucking successful at it. Some of kanye's smartest lyrics in this album, such as ""all of y'all mario, it's all a game"" (mario is an anagram of Omari, which is kanye's middle name. this shifts the lyric completely, and gives it a double meaning, he's basically just saying that everyone in the rap game in the current year is copying his 808's and yeezus shit, and that it's just what the industry wants)
Please, if you haven‚Äôt, listen to MBDTF, one of the greatest albums of all time."

It is commonly üê© referred üìñ to as one ‚òù of the most influential üôÉ records üìù of our generation üëå, as it sparked the new üëå generation üë∂ of rappers üé§üë®üèæ.

MBDTF ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è is one 1Ô∏è‚É£ of the best üëå albums üíø of all üíØ time ‚è∞ in my opinion üòÇ, the best üèÜ hiphop üéô album üíø of all üíØ time üïê, and it was extremely üíØ critically üòÆüòß acclaimed. 
***Yeezus üíΩ*** 
After üëÄ releasing a legendary üò®üòß album üíΩ, kanye üë®üèø had all üíØ eyes üëÄ on üîõ him üë¥.

1406,2020-10-02 06:56:39,j3pwgh,"Kanye‚Äôs awbum twack wecowd is awmost compwetewy spotwess, spowting the best discogwaphy in hip hop of aww time. Hewe‚Äôs a wundown of most Kanye awbums and why they‚Äôwe mastewpieces. I cannot do them enough justice thwough text so I suggest you wisten to them.
***The Cowwege Dwopout***
Kanye's fiwst awbum, he got a deaw with Jay Z and was about to finish his fiwst awbum, then he cwashed his caw aftew a wate wecowding session. He was vewy unwikewy to suwvive but was saved, and had to have his entiwe jaw wedone. He needed to finish his awbum, but he had his jaw cwosed with a wiwe, so he made the wast song singing thwough the wiwe.
***Wate Wegistwation***
Mowe of the same, he had a successfuw caweew waunch and pwoved himsewf with a sowid jazz wap wecowd. Highwights awe Woses and Hey Mama. Hey Mama was a sweet song dedicated to his mothew, which he considewed his best fwiend.
***Gwaduation***
One of the peaks of kanye hype. Him and 50cent wewe fighting to see who couwd get the most awbum sawes, kanye beat him by 3x the amount of sawes. Seemed wike the height of his caweew, but that was soon to aww faww cwumbwing down
***808's and Heawtbweak***
Kanye's mothew, Donda West, wanted to get a cosmetic bweast weduction suwgewy. Kanye paid fow it, and she died due to mawpwactice and faiwuwe to compwy with safety weguwations. She was sent back home in a cwiticaw state, and kanye was thewe to say his goodbyes. This took a massive toww on his heawth and caused/affected his divowce. This wecowd was made amidst aww of his gwief. It is commonwy wefewwed to as one of the most infwuentiaw wecowds of ouw genewation, as it spawked the new genewation of wappews.
***My Beautifuw Dawk Twisted Fantasy***
Howy shit howy shit howy shit. Aftew weweasing his wast awbum, 808's and heawbweak, to wukewawm cwitic weception, kanye took it pewsonawwy. He had eawwiew gone on stage duwing the VMA's and cwaimed that taywow swift did not desewve hew awawd. A wot of dwama and a wot of shit going on in his wife spuwwed him to compwetewy wemove sociaw media fwom his wife, and he went off to hawaii to isowate himsewf. MBDTF is one of the best awbums of aww time in my opinion, the best hiphop awbum of aww time, and it was extwemewy cwiticawwy accwaimed.
***Yeezus***
Aftew weweasing a wegendawy awbum, kanye had aww eyes on him. Evewybody expected him to make something to the stywe of MBDTF, and he wanted to subvewt expectations. He mawwied kim kawdashian awound this time. Kanye decided to move himsewf to the centew of the fashion industwy, fwance. He spent most of his awbum-making time thewe, and duwing his stay, kim kawdashian was kidnapped and wobbed at gunpoint. This spuwwed a whowe wot of angew and confusion in him, causing him to make one of the best and weiwdest hip-hop awbums to this date. Yeezus has a wot of industwiaw and noise ewements, and it is a vewy angwy awbum. A wot of peopwe did not see the vision in this awbum at fiwst, wesuwting in a wukewawm weaction at fiwst. Watew down the wine yeezus has begun to be pwaised fow it's fowwawd-thinking pwoduction and shit, and now it's considewed one of his best awbums.
***The Wife of Pabwo***
Aftew Yeezus, kanye decided to cawm the fuck down. He said he was wowking on gospew music, and then he just weweased a hiphop awbum and pwetended it was gospew. It incowpowated a wot of ewements of gospew, but it's stiww a kanye awbum. This awbum wecieved bad weactions at fiwst, and kanye did not wike this, so he just stwaight up wedid the entiwe awbum, and the wewowk was wecieved extwemewy weww by cwitics and fans awike. The wewowk incwuded ""saint pabwo"", one of kanye's most wegendawy songs due to it's intensewy pewsonaw message and cawwbacks to his woots.
**Ye**
Kanye's bipowaw was acting up wike nevew befowe, and duwing one of his highs he made his infamous swavewy comment. Duwing this time, he awso stawted pwaising twump and doing a bunch of ovewaww cwazy and out-of-chawactew shit. Ye goes into kanye's deepest insecuwities and thoughts, and tawgets them head-on.
***Kids See Ghosts***
amazing awbum, it was a cowwabowation between kid cudi and kanye. basicawwy Ye on stewwoids. Kanye and Cudi wewe attempting to make ""music thewapy"", and they wewe weawwy fucking successfuw at it. Some of kanye's smawtest wywics in this awbum, such as ""aww of y'aww mawio, it's aww a game"" (mawio is an anagwam of Omawi, which is kanye's middwe name. this shifts the wywic compwetewy, and gives it a doubwe meaning, he's basicawwy just saying that evewyone in the wap game in the cuwwent yeaw is copying his 808's and yeezus shit, and that it's just what the industwy wants)
Pwease, if you haven‚Äôt, wisten to MBDTF, one of the gweatest awbums of aww time."
1407,2020-10-02 06:56:40,j3pwgh,"Kanye‚Äôs album track record is almost completely spotless, sporting the best discography in hip hop of all time. Here‚Äôs a rundown of most Kanye albums and why they‚Äôre masterpieces. I cannot do them enough justice through text so I suggest you listen to them.
***The College Dropout***
Kanye's first album, he got a deal with Jay Z and was about to finish his first album, then he crashed his car after a late recording session. He was very unlikely to survive but was saved, and had to have his entire jaw redone. He needed to finish his album, but he had his jaw closed with a wire, so he made the last song singing through the wire.
***Late Registration***
More of the same, he had a successful career launch and proved himself with a solid jazz rap record. Highlights are Roses and Hey Mama. Hey Mama was a sweet song dedicated to his mother, which he considered his best friend.
***Graduation***
One of the peaks of kanye hype. Him and 50cent were fighting to see who could get the most album sales, kanye beat him by 3x the amount of sales. Seemed like the height of his career, but that was soon to all fall crumbling down
***808's and Heartbreak***
Kanye's mother, Donda West, wanted to get a cosmetic breast reduction surgery. Kanye paid for it, and she died due to malpractice and failure to comply with safety regulations. She was sent back home in a critical state, and kanye was there to say his goodbyes. This took a massive toll on his health and caused/affected his divorce. This record was made amidst all of his grief. It is commonly referred to as one of the most influential records of our generation, as it sparked the new generation of rappers.
***My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy***
Holy shit holy shit holy shit. After releasing his last album, 808's and hearbreak, to lukewarm critic reception, kanye took it personally. He had earlier gone on stage during the VMA's and claimed that taylor swift did not deserve her award. A lot of drama and a lot of shit going on in his life spurred him to completely remove social media from his life, and he went off to hawaii to isolate himself. MBDTF is one of the best albums of all time in my opinion, the best hiphop album of all time, and it was extremely critically acclaimed.
***Yeezus***
After releasing a legendary album, kanye had all eyes on him. Everybody expected him to make something to the style of MBDTF, and he wanted to subvert expectations. He married kim kardashian around this time. Kanye decided to move himself to the center of the fashion industry, france. He spent most of his album-making time there, and during his stay, kim kardashian was kidnapped and robbed at gunpoint. This spurred a whole lot of anger and confusion in him, causing him to make one of the best and weirdest hip-hop albums to this date. Yeezus has a lot of industrial and noise elements, and it is a very angry album. A lot of people did not see the vision in this album at first, resulting in a lukewarm reaction at first. Later down the line yeezus has begun to be praised for it's forward-thinking production and shit, and now it's considered one of his best albums.
***The Life of Pablo***
After Yeezus, kanye decided to calm the fuck down. He said he was working on gospel music, and then he just released a hiphop album and pretended it was gospel. It incorporated a lot of elements of gospel, but it's still a kanye album. This album recieved bad reactions at first, and kanye did not like this, so he just straight up redid the entire album, and the rework was recieved extremely well by critics and fans alike. The rework included ""saint pablo"", one of kanye's most legendary songs due to it's intensely personal message and callbacks to his roots.
**Ye**
Kanye's bipolar was acting up like never before, and during one of his highs he made his infamous slavery comment. During this time, he also started praising trump and doing a bunch of overall crazy and out-of-character shit. Ye goes into kanye's deepest insecurities and thoughts, and targets them head-on.
***Kids See Ghosts***
amazing album, it was a collaboration between kid cudi and kanye. basically Ye on sterroids. Kanye and Cudi were attempting to make ""music therapy"", and they were really fucking successful at it. Some of kanye's smartest lyrics in this album, such as ""all of y'all mario, it's all a game"" (mario is an anagram of Omari, which is kanye's middle name. this shifts the lyric completely, and gives it a double meaning, he's basically just saying that everyone in the rap game in the current year is copying his 808's and yeezus shit, and that it's just what the industry wants)
Please, if you haven‚Äôt, listen to MBDTF, one of the greatest albums of all time."

1427,2020-10-02 04:02:21,j3mi6b,That is not ~~what Fantano said~~ my opinion.
1428,2020-10-02 06:01:40,j3mi6b,does he like fish sticks?
1429,2020-10-02 04:50:19,j3mi6b,"I enjoy most of his work up to and including Yeezus. Production-wise he was largely influential in bringing back soul/R&B samples to modern hip hop. 'Greatest of our generation' is probably a stretch, especially given he's better known for Twitter outbursts over the last 5+ years. 

I do think some people tend to judge and assume his music is bad based on his ego and outlandish behaviour. Probably some of these people also hate hip hop in general and would make the same comments about Kendrick Lamar, Denzel Curry etc.

You can be a dickhead and still make great music."

1433,2020-10-02 10:02:51,j3mi6b,Haha he's not even close.  There are thousands of better artists. He's mediocre at best. Upvoted.
1434,2020-10-02 10:27:30,j3mi6b,"OP, if you enjoy lyricism, there are people far superior to it than Kanye, and there are many of them.

On that note, he is clearly an extremely influential artist and many people love his work (I'm not a fan). From what I hear from casual fans, he's a damn good artist.

To give a superior response to this one, you'd have to further define ""greatest"" and ""our generation"", though I may still disagree with you."
1435,2020-10-02 07:01:07,j3mi6b,"How is this even a slightly unpopular opinion?
Just this decade he dropped kids see ghost which had an amazing critical reception. Mbdtf is considered one of the best album of the past decade.

I know he has a lot of haters but I'm pretty sure the general public and more importantly the music scene knows that kanye is one of the most influential artist of the last decades.

You are the 9 dentist my dude!"

1437,2020-10-02 06:43:04,j3mi6b,">Kanye's mother, Donda West, wanted to get a cosmetic breast reduction surgery. Kanye paid for it, and she died due to malpractice and failure to comply with safety regulations.

I don't understand why all these random details about his life make his music good.  At any rate I've heard people say this kind of thing before so I do intend to give some time to listening to a full album of his.  I used to assume Eminem was shit too, for no good reason, until I actually listened to his stuff.

So I'm neither upvoting nor downvoting."
1438,2020-10-02 06:05:52,j3mi6b,"While its a far stretch to say ""Kanye is the greatest artist of our generation"", I take offence with anyone in comments who consider him bad.

He has a solid discography that push the genre forward coupled with some solid bangers. The only way someone won't acknowledge his music, if they formed an opinion from his controversies and didn't bother listening to his music"
1439,2020-10-02 07:45:02,j3mi6b,I can't take him seriously when he compares himself to Jim Morrison.
1440,2020-10-02 05:09:36,j3mi6b,"I like his music and he‚Äôs pretty damn good at producing quality music imo, but i feel like his hay days are gone now. But he aint the greatest artist of our generation, thats a long stretch"
1441,2020-10-02 05:55:40,j3mi6b,"This is what I‚Äôm talking about. Kanye didn‚Äôt just invent his narcissism for fun. The dude was pumping out Plat records like it was *nothing*. 808s changed the entirety of Pop music. 

That being said, his fame definitely led to poor mental health, and the man has gone off the deep end too many times to count."
1442,2020-10-02 08:05:50,j3mi6b,"I definitely like Kanye's music, I always have, and I don't think that's an unpopular opinion based on the number of albums and concerts he's been able to sell. 

You could argue that he's a musical genius, but aside from that, he's far from a genius.

Judging from his a public persona, he's a complete dumbass, and a massive douchebag at that. It's likely that he's exaggerating for publicity, but that doesn't make him any less obnoxious.

Idiot or not, however, the man has made some incredible music, I'm with you on that"
1443,2020-10-02 08:49:45,j3mi6b,"His first few albums were nice, but best discography in hip hop?  Greatest in a generation?  Nah."
1444,2020-10-02 10:39:57,j3mi6b,You didn't explain why any of the albums were masterpieces. You just said what was happening in his life when he wrote it. Getting in a car crash doesn't make an album good.

It's just him drawling out lyrics about scooping poop, being chosen by God, and consoomer culture references, with a couple of his dipshit hot takes sprinkled in. It's hard not to mention his stupid offensive opinions when they form the backbone of so many of his pieces.

1560,2020-10-02 06:43:00,j3mi6b,Didn‚Äôt even read past the first sentence. I really like Kanye and he gets a bad rap but man he‚Äôs been putting out trash for years
1561,2020-10-02 07:01:48,j3mi6b,"Man I love kanye, but please.. have some actual arguments seesh. 

Also skipping Jesus is king lmao"

1563,2020-10-02 07:23:25,j3mi6b,Kanye chills with his proud boy friends with his maga hat on. Shame he is a rat
1564,2020-10-02 12:07:24,j3mi6b,ok now this is a real cringy pasta
1565,2020-10-02 05:42:08,j3mi6b,"didnt read, dont care, eminem still better"
1566,2020-10-02 06:04:53,j3mi6b,Downvoted because I agree. He is one of the most misunderstood people of our time and is vilified for being polarizing. That being said I didn't read your wall of text and I'm just addressing the title. It looks like you just argue for the musical greatness of his albums tho
1567,2020-10-02 06:39:17,j3mi6b,You really do need help.
1568,2020-10-02 06:49:03,j3mi6b,"Put some fucking space, skip lines, I'm not reading this brick, upvoted cause obviously you're a nut job though haha"

Seriously though, Graduation and MDTF are both good albums"
1570,2020-10-02 10:23:52,j3mi6b,"This could be a great copypasta.

You really trying to tell me ""all of y'all mario, it's all a game"" is smart? Regardless of whether his middle name is an anagram or not, it doesn't even come close. It's just dumb.

I preferred the Life of Pablo album by Dan Bull."
1571,2020-10-02 11:16:41,j3mi6b,"I don't care at all about his music, but no one who supports Trump can be a genius."
1572,2020-10-02 19:36:06,j3mi6b,"@.Mods why is this shit allowed? The point of this sub is to express/have a discussion about actual opinions, not this give a place for every useless 2 bit wanker to post an aggravated assault on the eyes?

JFC remove this bullshit already."
1573,2020-10-06 07:16:29,j3mi6b,"do you see the kanye youtube video he playing the piano? he only press one key and the people star screaming and hype him like he is fucking Beethoven but he does n¬¥t , he just put a sample in different keys whit the same tempo, press the different keys and wow its a genius he knows how to create music, camon guys more music culture in your heads makes you better critics"
1574,2020-10-02 16:08:57,j3mi6b,Gay Fish forever ‚ù§Ô∏è
1575,2020-10-02 04:22:26,j3mi6b,"In your confusion I think you said that Kanye west made good music, which is absurde. Because no sane human being would write that without puking."
1576,2020-10-02 06:18:10,j3mi6b,"I, a black woman, agree that Kanye is a musical Genius"
1577,2020-10-02 13:00:40,j3mi6b,This is an emoji pasta now.
1578,2020-10-02 09:19:06,j3mi6b,Everyone is entitled to their opinion no matter how wrong it is.
1579,2020-10-02 08:11:19,j3mi6b,Good catch
1580,2020-10-02 08:29:52,j3mi6b,"Idk how much of a 10th dentist this is.  This opinion is so common, I mean I basically have it.  I do like how OP didn‚Äôt include JIK tho cuz it clearly doesn‚Äôt live up to the rest of his discog.  Also OP, you totally reached on the ‚ÄúMario‚Äù line meaning.  It‚Äôs just Mario‚Äî> game.  I admit Kanye is a musical genius who can pull together great ideas from many to create magic, but his lyrics themselves generally don‚Äôt go that deep, especially as time has gone on.  If they do, it‚Äôs usually a simple line with a deep meaning.  It‚Äôs also really important to remember many of his great verses are basically Rhymefest or Cyhi the Prince or someone else writing.  His music is great, but it‚Äôs the great ideas of several."
1581,2020-10-02 06:28:20,j3mi6b,Yeah there is no way OP typed all that.
1582,2020-10-02 07:10:52,j3mi6b,"Well, no matter. Now it is one."
1583,2020-10-02 08:12:03,j3mi6b,I thought I was reading it on copypasta
1584,2020-10-02 07:15:30,j3mi6b,I just looked it up - nope.  It's genuine.
1585,2020-10-02 07:14:29,j3mi6b,"Maybe, cause he didn't mention Jesus is King which was last year. Or maybe because that's one of his worse albums idk"
1586,2020-10-02 07:53:23,j3mi6b,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Kanye West. The genius is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical music most of his albums will go over a typical listener's head. There's also Kanye's narcissistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from genius literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of Kanye's music, to realise that they're not just genius- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Kanye West truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Kanye's existential catchphrase ""I'mma let you finish,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Beyonce's best video of all time. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Kanye's genius music unfolds itself on their airpods. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Kanye West tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid üòé"
1587,2020-10-02 10:51:09,j3mi6b,The genius and best artist of a generation things are from a South Park episode making fun Kanye West.
1588,2020-10-03 21:34:38,j3mi6b,I mean it will be copy pasta soon
1589,2020-10-02 11:37:24,j3mi6b,"I mean, somebody would have had to make it first, right?

Also OP is spot on"
1590,2020-10-02 16:16:07,j3mi6b,Oh I thot I was on r/copypasta
1591,2020-10-02 06:51:06,j3mi6b,that could be on reddit's end. I wrote a comment  on my phone and it formatted my line breaks out one time
1592,2020-10-02 05:55:15,j3mi6b,Well... can‚Äôt expect much from someone who thinks Kanye is a genius.
1593,2020-10-02 11:01:23,j3mi6b,I'm on mobile and I can see them on my end. Maybe op edited? Or op also in mobile. Not sure how it works
1594,2020-10-02 04:59:49,j3mi6b,"If it isnt, it shouldbe."
1595,2020-10-02 06:39:56,j3mi6b,"Dang, that would be one long copypasta."
1596,2020-10-02 10:51:32,j3mi6b,"Was really fucking late, I‚Äôm reading this back now and it‚Äôs some of the most retarded shit I‚Äôve ever written"
1597,2020-10-02 14:47:12,j3mi6b,lol indeed
1598,2020-10-02 07:10:05,j3mi6b,It should be
1599,2020-10-02 07:51:50,j3mi6b,"I‚Äôm not a hip hop fan at all, but my kid has shown an interest a while back, so I searched up a few highly regarded albums to prompt him. I had a listen to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (pls forgive typos) and I was blown away by the quality of it.  
Kanye is a very, very good artist. Pity he‚Äôs such a monumental asshole."
1600,2020-10-02 07:44:33,j3mi6b,underrated comment
1601,2020-10-02 18:44:30,j3mi6b,"This is the same logic conservatives use to dismiss liberal celebrities. Collin Kaepernick is a football player, what does he know about politics? Greta Thunberg is a 16 year old child what does she know about climate change? 

Discounting Kanye‚Äôs opinions because he‚Äôs not a politician or whatever is hypocritical. He has shit opinions, but they should be dismissed based on the fact that they‚Äôre shit not in the fact that he‚Äôs famous."
1602,2020-10-02 05:04:47,j3mi6b,You can tell by the lack of half decent grammar
1603,2020-10-28 06:20:55,j3mi6b,‚ÄúHe‚Äôs popular and I don‚Äôt like his fans so he‚Äôs bad‚Äù
1604,2020-10-02 10:58:47,j3mi6b,He ain‚Äôt a god but up I like his music a lot. Also I‚Äôm Hispanic
1605,2020-10-06 12:21:59,j3mi6b,"As an adult Kanye fan, most of us know he‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous. For the most part we‚Äôre a self-aware bunch. We just vibe with his music. It‚Äôs evident if you go over to r/Kanye. 

Sorry if this response is too late to be relevant!"
1606,2020-10-02 05:10:25,j3mi6b,What happened to that sub lmao
1607,2020-10-02 12:19:00,j3mi6b,Fixed the post you're welcome
1608,2020-10-02 06:14:10,j3mi6b,"Yeah, this post really could've ended after the first sentence."
1609,2020-10-02 11:23:51,j3mi6b,OP improved it.
1610,2020-10-02 12:06:50,j3mi6b,"you're seriously missing out, this is some gourmet shit"
1611,2020-10-02 08:31:02,j3mi6b,I read all of it. It's a beautifully crafted essay.
1612,2020-10-13 09:21:02,j3mi6b,It‚Äôs satire someone put this paragraph here earlier and they‚Äôre just making fun of it
1613,2020-10-02 11:17:34,j3mi6b,Kendrick Lamar is better than him.
1614,2020-10-02 14:24:34,j3mi6b,I can see a solid frickin argument for him being that. I'm not sure I agree with you.
1615,2020-10-02 15:10:54,j3mi6b,I wouldn't call him THE best but he's definitely one of the most talented artists of this generation
1616,2020-10-28 06:22:09,j3mi6b,LMAO TRUE.
1617,2020-10-02 07:34:12,j3mi6b,So you‚Äôre a Gay fish
1618,2020-10-02 06:14:15,j3mi6b,I really like Ye but you can tell the artistic vision isn't as flushed out as the albums you like. I think people kind of need to understand the history of hip hop as well as enjoy listening to it to see why some people call Kanye a genius
1619,2020-10-02 04:54:37,j3mi6b,Kendrick Lamar and Denzel Curry aren't dickheads and make better music
1620,2020-10-02 10:26:23,j3mi6b,???
1621,2020-10-06 07:14:07,j3mi6b,"Them‚Äôs fighting words. His newer music is pretty trash, but old Kanye pretty much made modern rap/r&b. Every other song was a top 10 hit. Not the best of a generation, but his blueprint on music is seriously underrated"
1622,2020-10-28 06:24:26,j3mi6b,People like him because he‚Äôs not just a boring ass MC that people praise. He makes different music and innovates in creative ways.
1623,2021-03-02 03:59:57,j3mi6b,My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy
1624,2020-10-28 06:25:21,j3mi6b,"Fuck lyricism, people worship lyrics too much, Kanye actually makes interesting and innovative music that‚Äôs different."
1625,2020-10-02 12:13:49,j3mi6b,Nah I find deep lyrics boring I just want something that's funny and enjoyable. Production way more important
1626,2020-10-02 07:19:12,j3mi6b,"People on this site seem to despise Kanye West, the same way they used to seethe with rage over Kim Kardashian, so it might trick some into thinking he's actually unpopular"
1627,2020-10-02 07:51:14,j3mi6b,"On reddit he's pretty unpopular but yeah, in any community that even remotely enjoys hip hop this is not unpopular at all"
1628,2020-10-02 10:41:28,j3mi6b,"Op has to be trolling, probably some hiphopcirclejerk."
1629,2020-10-02 08:47:39,j3mi6b,For first listening would highly recommend Life of Pablo
1630,2020-10-02 13:29:31,j3mi6b,Fixed the post now
1631,2020-10-02 07:23:43,j3mi6b,"I tried to listen to his music because of I hear his name often, but basically I find his style of music to be terrible. He seems better than others of the same music genre, but for me it remains something I don't enjoy listening at all"
1632,2020-10-28 06:28:20,j3mi6b,"Jim Morrison is more overrated than Kanye. His voice is trash and his music is cheesy and boring. I like old classic rock, too, just Jim Morrison is unbearable."
1633,2020-10-02 12:14:35,j3mi6b,Absolutely.
1634,2020-10-28 06:29:10,j3mi6b,More like people shitting on Kanye.
1635,2020-10-02 11:18:38,j3mi6b,I hope we both die.
1636,2020-10-28 06:29:24,j3mi6b,Who is then?
1637,2020-10-02 14:42:06,j3mi6b,They were.. i saw this post last night and decided I didn't have time to read it. This morning I went to give it a shot and emojis everywhere üôÉ
1638,2020-10-03 15:38:33,j3mi6b,"I don‚Äôt care about good lyrics dude. He usually writes most of the songs himself or has people in the studio to brainstorm with. There‚Äôs a couple songs he‚Äôs had written but I don‚Äôt really care because I don‚Äôt care for smart lyrics, it‚Äôs all about the instrumental for me."
1639,2020-10-28 06:29:47,j3mi6b,You haven‚Äôt listened to his music.

1642,2020-10-02 06:19:12,j3mi6b,"It's entirely subjective. Considering his consistency, influence, and amount of classics it's not that hot of a take for someone to have him in their top 5's. I'm not sure how you can look through his discography and not acknowledge the quality. Also, most Kanye fans that I've seen really don't appreciate his antics and shit on him all the time for it so I wouldn't say he has a massive cult of personality. ."
1643,2020-10-02 04:51:15,j3mi6b,Jesus Christ that was extremely aggressive. What did he do to hurt you
1644,2020-10-02 05:32:21,j3mi6b,Damn did Kanye fuck your wife or are you just trying to be edgy?
1645,2020-10-02 05:44:01,j3mi6b,"Kanye is definitely one of the most influential rappers of all time lol. He's at worst ""not your cup of tea"""
1646,2020-10-02 05:47:16,j3mi6b,I know that taste is subjective but im sure you dont even listen to Kanye‚Äôs music you just hate him for his rants and his relationships with the kardashians

1650,2020-10-02 05:49:59,j3mi6b,Kanye‚Äôs music is good idk what you‚Äôre on. Did he fuck your bitch or something?

1652,2021-03-02 04:04:52,j3mi6b,Listen to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy
1653,2020-10-02 11:26:25,j3mi6b,That's a more unpopular opinion than OP's.
1654,2020-10-02 12:16:49,j3mi6b,I like kendrick but I prefer production over lyrics so my pick goes to Kanye

What I like about him is how he takes on new styles and he clearly has his ear to the ground and was ahead of most mainstream rappers with a lot of stuff. Even the stuff after that that didn't work, he was trying something.


In terms of rapping, no he's not fantastic but I would argue that's not really the point of Kanye. It's about fantastic production, fun songs and pulling together great guests. Regarding the lyrics, I completely agree about the ghostwriters. Nothing wrong with any of that, it's what Dr Dre built his career on, too."

1692,2020-10-02 16:06:00,j3mi6b,You need to do double breaks
1693,2020-10-02 12:58:46,j3mi6b,It fucking reads like an emojipasta now wtf
1694,2020-10-02 12:34:03,j3mi6b,"For me its less about what is written and more about all the emojis.

Is it like, an ironic thing or something?"
1695,2020-10-02 10:08:08,j3mi6b,"If it wasn't, now it is."
1696,2020-10-02 07:30:05,j3mi6b,It is
1697,2020-10-02 11:17:00,j3mi6b,"His personality has massively improved since the start. Then he started to have mental health issues, sucks that he was just starting to become a much better person and then he was cursed with mental illness"

1706,2020-10-02 18:20:45,j3mi6b,"he's talented

not even close though"
1707,2020-10-02 04:57:40,j3mi6b,"I'm not talking about them being dickheads or being better or worse than Kanye, I'm just saying some people who trash Kanye would also trash other hip hop artists because they don't think hip hop is a legitimate form of music."
1708,2020-10-02 10:12:43,j3mi6b,Kanye‚Äôs discography is far better than Denzel‚Äôs and a little better than Kendrick‚Äôs although that could change in the future. Have you only listened to Kanye‚Äôs music since 2015? I just don‚Äôt understand how you could say Denzel makes better music and I love Denzel. His output in recent years has been much better than Kanye‚Äôs though.
1709,2020-10-02 15:27:16,j3mi6b,"Kendrick is arguable, but Denzel Curry? No lmao"
1710,2020-10-06 09:09:19,j3mi6b,"Nah, he's rated just fine. Definitely not seriously underrated! Plenty of fools constantly claiming he's a genius or the greatest when he ain't even close."
1711,2020-10-28 15:17:09,j3mi6b,"Worship lyrics too much? Dude not from what I'm hearing on the radio. There's a reason why lyrics are important. Lyrics makes a good beat into a great song. Like are you wanting really pretty wallpaper for your background or do you want to observe and experience Caravagios masterpiece? Both are cool and I'm not shitting on anyone, but I just prefer the latter.

Also, you wanna talk innovative, Flobots have that in spades. Theyre an experimental hip hop group. How many people have a live choir, trumpet, viola, drums, and guitar on their tracks? They not enough? There are plenty of other interesting and innovative artist that focus heavily on lyricism"
1712,2020-10-02 16:12:50,j3mi6b,"Man that's where we fundamentally disagree. Production is important but if I'm entirely about lyricism. People like Flobots and Immortal Technique are where I'm at. Talking about shit that affects us all. I could write paragraphs explaining their couplets. 

""...Handcuffs and statutes, strange fruit makes bad juice..."", is nothing short of genius.

Keep enjoying music."
1713,2020-10-02 11:01:29,j3mi6b,Kanye is an asshole and some people think it translates to his music. Others just hate hip-hop and Kanye is one the biggest hip-hop artists so is the easiest to hate.
1714,2020-10-02 13:27:40,j3mi6b,"Uh, OP regularly posts in /r/WestSubEver 

They sound like the really love Kayne.  Which is totally fine, but they seem to think we'll also love to hear everything about him."
1715,2020-10-02 13:30:39,j3mi6b,Shit now you've convinced me of his genius
1716,2020-10-02 17:21:05,j3mi6b,"Its fine if his music doesn't click with you. But objectively Kanye is far from a bad artist, considering his contribution to Hip-hop"
1717,2020-10-02 08:44:58,j3mi6b,whats ‚Äúhis style of music?‚Äù he‚Äôs done a lot of different things i dont think you can really say he has a specific style.
1718,2020-10-02 14:59:19,j3mi6b,"Just out of pure curiosity, what kind of music do you enjoy?"
1719,2020-10-02 08:22:25,j3mi6b,Which is fair
1720,2020-10-28 06:27:17,j3mi6b,"There‚Äôs a Kanye song for everyone, and every album has amazing songs."
1721,2021-03-02 04:04:07,j3mi6b,What album did you listen to?
1722,2020-10-03 16:58:37,j3mi6b,"> I don‚Äôt care about good lyrics

That explains why you like Kanye.

Fr though, wouldn't that make you not enjoy it? Since he mumbles over all of it? Don't get me wrong - I actually enjoyed Blood on the Leaves (or at least the parts where Kanye shut up for) so I do get you there, just would've thought that'd make you dislike it or listen to the instrumentals only."
1723,2020-10-28 15:10:06,j3mi6b,"It is with immense regret that I can say Kanye's ""music"" has entered my ears and registered with my brain. I have, unfortunately, listened to Kanye.

Seriously though how do you think I've gone *my entire life* so far without hearing Kanye *and* somehow managed to reference his stupid lyrics?"
1724,2020-10-02 17:08:17,j3mi6b,Oh. Yea makes sense.
1725,2020-10-02 06:13:23,j3mi6b,"From a musical perspective. Do you not think a certain amount of intelligence is needed to make music? Whether you like his music or not, objectively, he is one of the modern greats and achieved some of the biggest heights an artist can achieve. Sure when he runs his mouth about other shit, especially politics, he seems like a complete fool, but that doesn't change the fact that he is insanely smart."
1726,2020-10-02 06:10:54,j3mi6b,Creativity smart. I think you have to be very into hip hop and understand the history of hip hop to see it. I didn't really get it before I got into hip hop either
1727,2020-10-02 05:51:12,j3mi6b,"Kanye is a musical genius, one of the smartest musicians ever (lyrically especially). He‚Äôs just a nut case who refuses to take his meds.

Watch Pete Davidson y‚Äôall about him to see what I mean"
1728,2020-10-02 05:47:29,j3mi6b,How is he not smart? He is fucking rich and known around the world... initially all because of his music... that‚Äôs oretty damn smart imo.
1729,2020-10-02 05:02:03,j3mi6b,"That's just a neckbeard redditor in his natural habitat, insulting people like this and acting like tough guy, as if he wants to compensate for something"

1734,2020-10-02 11:03:19,j3mi6b,"No,  but i have a feeling i will

Edit: yeah ok that was funny"
1735,2021-03-02 08:40:47,j3mi6b,"Got round to it but my opinion stays the same, this man is far too overhyped"
1736,2020-10-02 12:21:51,j3mi6b,"Wow ok, that's actually the first good argument I've ever heard for Kanye over Kendrick, and trust me I've heard lots of them. I'd probably actually agree Ye's a better producer, though I think his production doesn't have the same eclectic depth that Kendrick's does, his melodies are far more fun and easier to listen to. 

To me it's the difference between a Tarantino and a Coen Brothers movie. Tarantino movies are fun and stylish and easy to enjoy, Coen Brothers movies are dark and gritty but have more subtlety of character and writing."
1737,2020-10-02 16:22:46,j3mi6b,"I only saw the emoji-version.
That's a really cool response to those people."
1738,2020-10-02 20:11:38,j3mi6b,I hated them.

I might have  phrased it wrong but Its not like I don't like good lyrics, I just prefer more blunt lyrics over subtle, deep lyrics.

1815,2020-10-02 19:58:04,j3mi6b,"thought you might just not like mtbmb... kamikaze? Really? You don't think kamikaze was a good album? You listened to Venom, Greatest, The Ringer, Not Alike... you didn't like them?

You're weird dude."
1816,2020-10-02 05:54:58,j3mi6b,"Nah it might have just been my bad spelling finally consuming the last of my phones will to live, my sucky spelling, or my autocorrect messing things up. I dunno, and I really don‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm being completely honest"
1817,2020-10-02 17:44:04,j3mi6b,"Spot on. I have heard some song where Kanye goes like ""something something makes me stronger"" and don't know anything else. Not impressed."
1818,2020-11-25 22:25:21,j3mi6b,"Balls, nuts even"
1819,2020-10-02 17:04:46,j3mi6b,"You must not be a man of God, blasphemy!"
1820,2020-10-02 13:01:31,j3mi6b,"You can be an asshole and also have bipolar. You can speak your mind and also be an asshole. You can contribute greatly to music and fashion (and I agree he has had a huge positive impact on music), and still be an asshole."
1821,2020-10-02 11:47:13,j3mi6b,"Very obviously,  yes"
1822,2020-10-02 14:15:28,j3mi6b,nah it's fixed trust me
1823,2020-10-02 15:16:55,j3mi6b,"can confirm, the emojis fixed it"
1824,2020-10-02 13:22:27,j3mi6b,I remember when r/PCM was a sub for bicycles lmfao
1825,2020-10-02 13:42:17,j3mi6b,"Bro don't ever delete this post man. When I first read this, I'm like well this opinion is so popular. After u added the emojis, this post heated up and got really spicy. Thanks for that. Gave me a big laugh my dude"
1826,2020-10-03 20:15:52,j3mi6b,"He ain‚Äôt monotone and I kinda like the unh shit lol. I like his voice because it has personality, but I can‚Äôt convince you because we just don‚Äôt see eye to eye. If you haven‚Äôt,  I think you should listen to the college dropout. It‚Äôs a perfect example of why I like his vocal style"
1827,2020-11-01 18:44:04,j3mi6b,"You‚Äôre thinking of Yeezus Kanye when talking about him. He used to be an asshole who though he was better than everybody, but he isn‚Äôt that anymore. He has release good music in the past 2 years being Kids see ghosts and Ye, idk what you have listened to of him, but listen to my beautiful dark twisted fantasy of you get a chance as well."
1828,2020-10-02 18:40:47,j3mi6b,"One of them is a narcissistic child who used their parent's money and connections to buy the music they couldn't make on their own and simply yelled over it while someone autotuned it into something tangible, the other one also did this. So yeah, the comparison is justifiable"
1829,2020-10-02 10:08:10,j3mi6b,"I think you're proving my point here not yours, unless you think it's a smart thing to do to be born into a wealthy family?"
1830,2020-10-02 06:09:29,j3mi6b,"definitely. while i‚Äôm not that much of a fan of 808s, i think the other four albums are definitely good and most people who like hip hop should listen to them eventually"
1831,2020-10-02 22:09:04,j3mi6b,kamikaze was basically an hour of eminem whining about how people don‚Äôt like him. i pretty much only liked the ringer and not alike
1832,2020-10-02 05:59:37,j3mi6b,"That‚Äôs kinda what I meant, autocorrect autocorrects to how you mostly spell things not just correct grammar,also sorry if I sounded condescending I am tired as fuck."
1833,2020-11-25 22:27:44,j3mi6b,Listen to Death or Control Denied. Chuck Schuldiner is a musical genius.
1834,2020-10-02 13:02:25,j3mi6b,How is he a asshole? Please explain. Is it because he is honest and speaks what is on his mind or it is another reason
1835,2020-10-08 22:54:09,j3mi6b,Lol
1836,2020-10-02 15:57:33,j3mi6b,no problem. the original post was terribly written so i just decided to destroy it
1837,2020-10-05 09:57:43,j3mi6b,Agree to disagree then. And at least it's not Drake.
1838,2020-10-02 10:15:16,j3mi6b,"No, I am saying that your aren‚Äôt just ‚Äúlucky‚Äù when you consitently are at the right place at the right time..."
1839,2020-10-04 00:03:54,j3mi6b,But like kids see ghosts tho
1840,2020-10-03 00:18:41,j3mi6b,"honestly fair assessment, still enjoyed it though."
1841,2020-10-02 06:06:02,j3mi6b,"Same, I had a long day. I dunno why I was so rude to OP... I feel bad now"
1842,2020-11-25 22:28:25,j3mi6b,I was fuckin with you but I might. I‚Äôm primarily into hiphop tho
1843,2020-10-02 13:47:33,j3mi6b,"He's rude and interrupts other people and throws tantrums in public when things aren't going his way. It's okay to get upset and all, but having bipolar doesn't meam rudeness and misbehaving are excused."
1844,2020-10-02 16:04:49,j3mi6b,"You should donate your mind to science, so we can nail down precisely what causes people to be as unobservant as people like you.  He's a fucking sociopath."
1845,2020-10-02 10:40:59,j3mi6b,"I personally don't believe in luck, I believe in cause and effect. He was born wealthy and into connections. He had the money to find what he wanted to do. He paid for top producers in Chicago to produce an album for him. Word got out in that tiny city that top producers had new material. It was well received because with art you get what you pay for. Common sense doesn't equate to being smart, is my point."
1846,2020-10-04 01:15:52,j3mi6b,oh yeah i completely forgot about ksg. it‚Äôs like a 7/10 imo
1847,2020-10-02 06:16:59,j3mi6b,"People tend to get a bit cranky when their tired, so it‚Äôs understandable."
1848,2020-10-02 06:20:05,j3mi6b,What do you listen to out of curiosity?
1849,2020-11-25 22:29:51,j3mi6b,Then start with control denied. It's a slightly more melodical than death and has clean vocals. Chuck formed both bands btw.
1850,2020-10-02 14:23:54,j3mi6b,"Every time he has interrupted (thrown tantrum) he did it because it was the right thing to day. For example when Taylor Swift got the award almost everyone agreed that she didnt deserve it over beyonce. He may not do it in the best way but he makes sure to get his point across and speak up. He is one of the only people to speak up against companies (music industry ex: tweeting about contracts, award industry ex: taylor swift situation) and also many other times he spoke publicly he has called out people on their bullshit."
1851,2020-10-02 16:07:37,j3mi6b,He has mental issues. He suffers bipolar.
1852,2020-10-02 12:49:49,j3mi6b,Cause and effect beyond your control that comes out positively is what people call luck. They aren't mutually exclusive.
1853,2020-10-02 14:05:50,j3mi6b,Dude define what being smart is then... you‚Äôre just rambling on and on about something that doesn‚Äôt change what I said.
1854,2020-10-02 13:13:55,j3mi6b,"Classic rock, alt rock, and some indie"
1855,2020-10-02 14:36:23,j3mi6b,"Nah - doesn't matter if (you think) you're right, there are times for you to speak and times for you to shut up because it's someone else's turn."
1856,2020-10-02 16:22:19,j3mi6b,"How long would you take psychological abuse from an abuser with bipolar?  Would it be wrong to leave them based on the abuse, or would you take the abuse over years and decades, with the phrase, ""He has mental issues.  He suffers bipolar"" on loop in your brain?

Being an asshole and suffering from bipolar disorder aren't mutually exclusive distinctions.  He is toxic to all around him, and people, even those not intimately close to him should feel no shame in speaking out against his behavior--irrespective to any medical prognosis that may help explain it."
1857,2020-10-02 13:13:52,j3mi6b,"Luck and chance are what the lazy brush off as cause and effect. They're not mutually exclusive you're right, but fundamentally they're not mutually inclusive at all. It's like comparing that to karma vs god (YHWH) in modern times."
1858,2020-10-02 14:18:23,j3mi6b,I'm gonna let somebody else take the reigns on this paint-drying conversation with you
1859,2020-10-02 14:40:27,j3mi6b,"I know but KanYe doesn‚Äôt follow the rules he is different and wants to make a change in the industry and if you don‚Äôt respect that then you don‚Äôt respect artist having their master and getting treated fairly. Lucky people like KanYe speak up and try and bring awareness to the bad contracts and treatments going
on."
1860,2020-10-02 16:23:36,j3mi6b,People around him do speak about his behaviour have you seen anything Kim tweeted or people worrying about him
1861,2020-10-02 14:20:01,j3mi6b,"Yeah yeah, as if there are others..."
1862,2020-10-02 16:32:19,j3mi6b,"Yes, and nothing about any of it normal or healthy.  If you're not convinced by reality, nothing else is going to change your mind about that piece of shit.  Have fun defending shit I guess."
1863,2020-10-02 14:22:33,j3mi6b,"If you notice the upvotes there's obviously people reading this convo. I haven't upvoted or downvoted anything you've said, so..."
1864,2020-10-02 16:44:04,j3mi6b,Your just mad KanYe speaks against the bad in the world because your probably part of the problem if you don‚Äôt see what he is saying.
1865,2020-10-02 14:24:47,j3mi6b,Reading but not ‚Äúinvolved‚Äù. And don‚Äôt start a conversation if you won‚Äôt ‚Äúend‚Äù it...
1866,2020-10-02 14:48:54,j3mi6b,"You ended it when you asked me to tell you the definition of ""smart"" because you don't understand the difference between smart and""lucky"""
1867,2020-10-02 18:00:21,j3mi6b,"It's not that I don't understand that ""difference"" it's that your definition of smart is very blurry in what you say.

Just tell me how you define smart already..."
1868,2020-10-02 07:19:20,j3ldxj,"I really appreciate you doing these, we don't get these in the UK so they're fun to read."
1869,2020-10-02 12:58:02,j3ldxj,"Thank you for posting this. The fact that they didn't even know they caught Kim crying at the time until they went back and watch the footage is crazy. I'm glad they did though. It was such a raw and powerful moment to see her so real, watching her daughter and being so proud. Definitely a highlight.

Have a safe trip, wherever you are going!"
1870,2020-10-02 19:58:49,j3ldxj,"Thanks so much for doing these, I look forward to them every week :)"
1871,2020-10-03 18:40:13,j3ldxj,kris lives across the street from kim? that's so nice!
1872,2020-10-16 06:12:01,j3ldxj,"The comment about Corey‚Äôs t-shirt took me OUT to the bawl-game LMAO. I thought I was the only one who noticed this!!!

Edit: word"
1873,2020-10-02 16:49:04,j3ldxj,No problem! Glad you're enjoying it :)
1874,2020-10-02 16:49:31,j3ldxj,Thanks for reading and your flair is 10/10.
1875,2020-10-04 07:58:24,j3ldxj,"she used to, but she moved a month ago"

Edit 1: Wow, this really blew up! Thanks for the upvotes, kind strangers!

Edit 2: thanks for the gold kinda stranger I didn‚Äôt expect this post to blow up! My life started growing up in a small farm in northern Kansas. My father was a farmer and my mother was a cashier in our local town down the dirt road. We didn‚Äôt have much and income was very little, my best toy I got growing up was a pig bladder blown up like a balloon that I could play around with between me and my two brothers. At the age of 11 things started getting tougher in my house life due to my fathers drinking problem as it was not a good harvest that year. Like his father before him once he was done working he would come home and drink but unlike his father he wouldn‚Äôt beat us unless we messed up, his father left him and his mother to fend for themselves after world war 2 though so he had it tougher than me growing up. One time my father did drink too much and he hit my little brother Jamey. Jamey didn‚Äôt know what to do and ran away during the night during a storm. The entire family was out looking for him but we never saw Jamey again. This made my father drink more and lead him to take his life when I was at the age of 16. My older brother and me had to completely take over the farm with the help of our mom quitting her job as a cashier, life got very hard from here on out. We got a break when I was 18 with a good harvest we were able to save up some money. I was able to move out at the age of 21 and into a larger city in Tennessee. It was hard leaving the family as my ma was getting older but my older brother completely took over the farm and even expanded it into a more profitable work. I began working in what I was good at, repairing mechanics. I was a hard worker and moved up in my chain of work easily within my town. I dated aroun‚Äô a bit but never settled down with anyone I would write home about for my first few years. When I was 26 I got a call from my ma, my brother was working with some machinery on the farm and got his hand caught in it and heavily damaged. I had to come home and help with the farm, at the time I had attained a high position as a senior mechanic within an auto shop and sometimes worked on the side with repairing electronics. I went home and had to help with the farm for a year, ma wasn‚Äôt doing good at all. She passed the next year due to kidney disease. My brother eventually recovered and I returned to Tennessee, I attempted to return to my position but due to the time I was out I had been long replaced. I had to begin to work from the bottom again when I had a client come in, she was the most beautiful woman I ever seen in Tennessee with gorgeous brown hair. Nice to say that we hit it off pretty well, within a few weeks we were dating. I can say that she was one of the best things to have happened to me in my life. At the age of 30 I married her and my first child was on the way then. I had returned to my previous position and bought a nice house near the mountains of Tennessee. At the age of 34 my second child was born. My two kids are now both in high school, one a freshman, another a Senior. I continued my career into more electronics working on computers and fixing them. In 2013 while googling how to fix a small problem with a motherboard I found a strange site named reddit.com, this website had all the answers I needed and a community always ready to help. I‚Äôve been on the site ever since. As you can see recently, I commented on this thread and some kind stranger gave me gold. Thank you again kind stranger.

üôÑ"
1934,2020-11-09 12:01:43,jqvfel,For Kim‚Äôs party everyone quarantined before that party
1935,2020-11-09 11:25:05,jqvfel,"Forget all that, focus on covid, masks, distancing, hand washing and living our lives!"
1936,2020-11-09 17:58:43,jqvfel,and Kanye lost too. lol
1937,2020-11-09 11:22:27,jqvfel,"Coming up next, Top 20 hit ‚ÄúPrivate Fauci‚Äù by Joey and the Pandemics."
1938,2020-11-09 13:05:29,jqvfel,"Me too.

And I bet we both would have been able to follow along much better than Kimmy Kakes."
1939,2020-11-09 11:27:36,jqvfel,I‚Äôd love to have a private zoom call with Kim. Might be hard to maintain eye contact
1940,2020-11-09 23:32:19,jqvfel,"The point being that, whatever we may think of them, they have followers who listen to them and will hopefully heed their advice about masks and protecting the whole community."
1941,2020-11-09 10:48:50,jqvfel,Fauci has actually been doing the influencer circuit (if there is such a thing) all summer trying to get his message out to as many folks as possible. He sees them as a means to his ends
1942,2020-11-09 10:57:56,jqvfel,there is a significant portion of the population who don't follow the news but follow the Kardashians. Reaching those people with good facts is important when fighting a pandemic
1943,2020-11-09 10:47:08,jqvfel,"> ""It was a whole bunch of movie stars and some sports figures and they wanted to know about what they could do to stay safe, about wearing masks and avoiding crowds,"" Fauci said. ""I was impressed by the questions they asked, by their level of sophistication.""

> Fauci said he did the Zoom call, which lasted about an hour, because the celebrities had ""megaphones"" and ""could get the word out about staying safe.""

Once again Fauci demonstrates grace and respect for others."
1944,2020-11-09 11:01:27,jqvfel,It‚Äôs smart to try and get a public health message out through channels that wouldn‚Äôt usually carry it. He‚Äôs not trying to win an election or worry about how he‚Äôs perceived he looking for efficient ways to save lives. I‚Äôd there‚Äôs a chance some people with large followings could help fight the virus he needs to take it
1945,2020-11-09 12:16:30,jqvfel,Why
1946,2020-11-09 12:02:31,jqvfel,[removed]
1947,2020-11-09 12:45:40,jqvfel,Not then fucking point
1948,2020-11-09 13:37:04,jqvfel,"They have way too much money and influence for ‚Äúus‚Äù to forget about them. They either need to be brought on board with the idea of global progress (and their money needs to be taxed to get us there) or they need to be countered and fought at every turn. When the next fascist Trumpian wannabe (whose even moderately competent) surfaces and the ultra wealthy starts backing them we, the people with the short and nearly empty pockets, will be fucked.  
  
Edit: but I agree with the short term COVID protocols you just mentioned and their urgency."
1949,2020-11-09 10:53:56,jqvfel,Are people trying to project this like it was private insider trading for people in the know? This 1 hour meeting would be a win for everyone.
1950,2020-11-09 12:48:19,jqvfel,The point is to deny yourself of happiness even when following regulations because..?
1951,2020-11-09 23:33:48,jqvfel,"Fauci is such a good hearted man, what a great example of how to be human in these sorry times."
1952,2020-11-09 11:00:05,jqvfel,"Right, I think Fauci is setting an example here of priorities, of what people should be focusing on."
1953,2020-11-09 14:14:39,jqvfel,"Because the regulations are there to keep you and everyone else safe *in a pandemic* as explained by the guy leading the charge? And your temporary happiness could be at the expense of other people‚Äôs lives? Kind of a good reason, no? 

Also, I find it unlikely they all quarantined. She‚Äôs been to Wyoming and DR and I believe Mexico (I don‚Äôt follow much, actually) before this trip. They‚Äôve been to each other‚Äôs houses and other gatherings. Kanye held a rally. Etc, etc.

And the certainly didn‚Äôt follow recommendations (small gatherings, limit unneeded travel, wear face coverings)."
1954,2020-11-09 14:34:35,jqvfel,"If you‚Äôre just going to assume dishonesty there‚Äôs nothing to discuss, you‚Äôre already admitting to drawing a path from a conclusion"
1955,2020-11-09 14:52:31,jqvfel,"Yes, that they didn‚Äôt quarantine is an assumption, but if I could be arsed could likely be proven by checking everyone‚Äôs Instagram. 

However, what assumption is there made in visually seeing them travel other places, hold large gatherings and not wear face masks? That‚Äôs factual. 

You can like Kim Kardashian and Kendall Jenner and still see that what they‚Äôre doing is dangerous and stupid."
1956,2020-11-09 02:16:33,jqnvz7,glad he didn't win tbh

Edit 1: Wow, this really blew up! Thanks for the upvotes, kind strangers!

Edit 2: thanks for the gold kinda stranger I didn‚Äôt expect this post to blow up! My life started growing up in a small farm in northern Kansas. My father was a farmer and my mother was a cashier in our local town down the dirt road. We didn‚Äôt have much and income was very little, my best toy I got growing up was a pig bladder blown up like a balloon that I could play around with between me and my two brothers. At the age of 11 things started getting tougher in my house life due to my fathers drinking problem as it was not a good harvest that year. Like his father before him once he was done working he would come home and drink but unlike his father he wouldn‚Äôt beat us unless we messed up, his father left him and his mother to fend for themselves after world war 2 though so he had it tougher than me growing up. One time my father did drink too much and he hit my little brother Jamey. Jamey didn‚Äôt know what to do and ran away during the night during a storm. The entire family was out looking for him but we never saw Jamey again. This made my father drink more and lead him to take his life when I was at the age of 16. My older brother and me had to completely take over the farm with the help of our mom quitting her job as a cashier, life got very hard from here on out. We got a break when I was 18 with a good harvest we were able to save up some money. I was able to move out at the age of 21 and into a larger city in Tennessee. It was hard leaving the family as my ma was getting older but my older brother completely took over the farm and even expanded it into a more profitable work. I began working in what I was good at, repairing mechanics. I was a hard worker and moved up in my chain of work easily within my town. I dated aroun‚Äô a bit but never settled down with anyone I would write home about for my first few years. When I was 26 I got a call from my ma, my brother was working with some machinery on the farm and got his hand caught in it and heavily damaged. I had to come home and help with the farm, at the time I had attained a high position as a senior mechanic within an auto shop and sometimes worked on the side with repairing electronics. I went home and had to help with the farm for a year, ma wasn‚Äôt doing good at all. She passed the next year due to kidney disease. My brother eventually recovered and I returned to Tennessee, I attempted to return to my position but due to the time I was out I had been long replaced. I had to begin to work from the bottom again when I had a client come in, she was the most beautiful woman I ever seen in Tennessee with gorgeous brown hair. Nice to say that we hit it off pretty well, within a few weeks we were dating. I can say that she was one of the best things to have happened to me in my life. At the age of 30 I married her and my first child was on the way then. I had returned to my previous position and bought a nice house near the mountains of Tennessee. At the age of 34 my second child was born. My two kids are now both in high school, one a freshman, another a Senior. I continued my career into more electronics working on computers and fixing them. In 2013 while googling how to fix a small problem with a motherboard I found a strange site named reddit.com, this website had all the answers I needed and a community always ready to help. I‚Äôve been on the site ever since. As you can see recently, I commented on this thread and some kind stranger gave me gold. Thank you again kind stranger.

2031,2020-10-31 13:49:51,jlgs0u,"I love this post!! This is all so interesting. I really enjoy analysis like this and its so informative for me when everyone relates the Kardashians to their every topics of interest; astrology, psychology, mythology, history, films, literature. It makes me understand the topic so much more. One question: so there are only 3 master numbers? 11, 22, 33? 

I just found out I am a master number 7.

""The detectives of numerology, 7 is known for its investigative abilities and analytical skills. Astrologically, the number 7 can be thought of as a blend of¬†Virgo¬†and¬†Scorpio¬†energy: 7 is extremely detail-oriented, but is driven by inner-wisdom as opposed to tangible realities. 7 has a keen eye, and its astute observations fuel a quick-witted, inventive spirit. Because it can quickly find the flaws in almost any system, 7 is a bit of a perfectionist. 7 will often assume fault, so it‚Äôs important for this number to counterbalance its inherent skepticism with an open mind. Not everything will be foolproof ‚Äî but that‚Äôs what makes life fun.""

I already see two things:
 i am very detail oriented to the point where even the *slighest* things out of order makes me blow up. Everything I do is planned to the smallest detail in my planner. Example: I note down the hair, jewellry, outfit and make up I will do for an event often weeks in advance. 
And the skepticism. My 8th grade teacher once said I was the most pessimistic person she had ever met, so there's that. But hey, it makes me have a Plan A, a Plan B, a Plan C and rough workings of Plan D and E. Does this mean half my waking hours I want to hit my head against a wall? Sure, but i'm never unprepared. 


I also googled my birth chart and it says I'm a pisces sun, a virgo moon, and a taurus rising."
2032,2020-10-31 14:01:27,jlgs0u,"For those wondering of the other‚Äôs Life Paths:

Khloe is a 1 

Kourtney is a 3 

Kylie is an 8

Kris is a 9 

Caitlyn is a 7

Rob is a 9 

Scott is a 7

2038,2020-10-31 17:56:59,jlgs0u,"OP, this was fascinating. It really shines through that Kim and Kanye are leaders and have greater vision. I think Kanye had a plan for the impoverished to live in eco friendly huts many years ago. Kim is freeing prisoners... I mean, this is probably 1% of what they do, but you catch the drift. They implement change."

If you‚Äôre interested I‚Äôve included links to some astrological related posts I wrote earlier this year that are linked within this post‚Äôs comments. Mostly Vanderpump Rules related, but I also did a birthday analysis and coincidental patterns for the cast of Survivor: Winners at War which might be interesting if you‚Äôre a Survivor fan like me :) 

Hope you had a lovely Halloween! üëª"
2047,2020-11-01 21:35:47,jlgs0u,"One of the challenges of having a Master Number as your Life Path is that the negative experiences you have can be a lot more impactful and deep, I read somewhere that master numbers are more likely to experience trauma and might seem like they have bad luck early in life, and master numbers also might find more success later in life after you think your time is already over or up. It‚Äôs also definitely one of those vibrating at a higher level/being an empath which is draining and sometimes uncontrollable. Feels like the weight of the world is on your shoulders!

Or a separate Kris show, a separate Kim show, a Khloe and Kourtney show, and a Kylie and Kendall show. 

This is just me assuming, going by where they have placed the commas in between the names. They mention Kris Jenner separately from Kylie and Kendall even tho they have the same last name. They're not doing it by age or Kourtney would have been placed before Kim was, and they're not doing it by relevancy or Kim would have been placed before Kris Jenner (or maybe Kris just wanted her name first

Or it could just be my PTSD from studying language and writing analysis as a minor so i'm reading too much into it. It could all just be one show."

I could definitely see them releasing future documentaries on Hulu but the projects will most likely be a family reality tv show and spin offs with several of them."

kim: criminal work docu style series

khloe: her and trues show bc that was mentioned by her

kylie: life with kylie season 2 type thing bc she once asked if we wanted a s2

kourtney: maybe something poosh wellness related like a cooking show idk?

candle: maybe a mini series about her modelling or horses idk"
2100,2020-12-15 16:31:09,kdj0vr,I took the same meaning from the phrasing.
2101,2020-12-15 11:12:37,kdj0vr,I didn't get that vibe but you have a great point.
2102,2020-12-15 12:17:43,kdj0vr,I could see Kim making a tv show or documentary about her criminal justice reform and it could appeal to people who don‚Äôt even like them
2103,2020-12-15 17:01:52,kdj0vr,"idk I would be pretty interested in seeing them develop their businesses. It could be pretty funny to see Kourt putting herself out there and trying new things for Poosh, or traveling to a new country trying the food and learning about the culture (like an Anthony Bourdain type show). Khloe could do another talk show."
2104,2020-12-16 13:27:50,kdj0vr,I can see how you would feel that way but we have 0 information about what the shows will acc be about so I understand that this is so new but there may be 1 or 2 you'll actually like or tolerate so maybe you shouldn't rule anything out.
2105,2020-12-16 12:18:29,kdj0vr,"idk she and Addison are filming for the She's All That Remake, Kourtney has Poosh to run and Addison has Item Beauty, she's a brand ambassador for American Eagle and has a thriving social media presence, there's no way they'd include Addison in the show and there's not enough time for them to do so."
2106,2020-12-16 14:39:45,kdj0vr,"Honestly, the most lively part of Life of Kylie was Jordyn üòû"
2107,2020-12-16 14:41:10,kdj0vr,"I agree with you about Kim but I'm not sure if docu series will work. She just did that format with oxygen and it was beautiful but I think it may make sense logistically if she did like a series vibe because she often gets involved and hears ppl out before she brings it to social media so that'd be an effective way to spread awareness because she also has to study and take practice tests so she rlly only gets invovled with one person's case at a time so I think it'd be great if she didn't rlly have to commit to seasons and she could just film a little bit of Case X, get it out and then come back with the next case.

As for Kourtney, I can def see that happening but I think she may just do BTS of Poosh because at the end of the season before this last season she reduced her filming time so that when she's on there she's just doing her thing or she's showing her Poosh stuff cause at the start of the last season she did the process of the article that Poosh did but that was right before the pandemic and I'm sure the way Poosh works has changed ever since then and she doesn't really want to be invovled in drama. But then again, Poosh is trying to develop their own YouTube channel and there's already stuff like that on there unless it was like Goop's deal with Netflix where it's Poosh and the content is produced and distributed via Hulu. I def think it'll be about cooking, wellness [e.tc](https://e.tc) so it will either be like her by herself or it'll be a Poosh series.

What you said about Kylie really makes sense because she has her Yt channel where she does bts of shoots, occasional vlogs and stuff but she uploads like twice a month and with YouTube only family channels and very appropriate content makes a lot in AdSense. Kylie and Stassie are friends with David Dobrik who is a insanely popular YouTuber, his videos get tens of millions of views and some get 20 mill, 30 mill e.t.c but he said at one point in time he'd make 200k a month via AdSense but now he makes only 2k a month but he's supplemented his income with merch, he launched a  photo and video app and even raised investment for it and has a lot of sponsors so with the Hulu deal Kylie has a guaranteed pay and doesn't need to worry about copyright and things like that. She seems passionate about YouTube but this Hulu deal may make the most sense for her.

Kendall is really interesting because she barely films for KUWTK so I have no idea why she'd sign the deal with Hulu and this makes me think they'll have one of their shows or type of content be a family thing cause most of the time the drama surrounding Kendall isn't really featured on the show aside from Kendall's argument with Kylie which wouldn't have been filmed unless they didn't all go on vacation together and were filming anyways and I can't see her doing her own show or type of content with Hulu if she didn't do it for E!."
2108,2020-12-15 15:33:34,kdj0vr,Personally I'd love to see more of her work but I don't think ppl who don't like her would watch it and they'd just use the same petty excuse that all her criminal justice work is just for attention
2109,2020-12-15 17:11:11,kdj0vr,Gwyneth Paltrow did a Goop series on Netflix I think where she and the Goop troop went and tried different experiences like a polar plunge in Lake Tahoe. Kourtneys professional cuddle episode of KUWTK reminded me of the Goop show and if she‚Äôs doing new content I bet it‚Äôll be just like that
2110,2020-12-16 23:48:39,kdj0vr,"true, that makes sense. They‚Äôve been hanging out for a long time now so that‚Äôs why I had that theory. lol"

He should have been spared because he reformed.

While his execution might not bring the victims back, why should he live when they died so many years ago?

Personally, I'm against the death penalty. I feel it's more of a punishment to make someone spend the rest of their life in prison, knowing they'll never taste freedom.
But sometimes justice is turning the other cheek, and sometimes justice is an eye for an eye."
2152,2020-12-11 14:51:27,kb3pbi,Yup it couldn't be clearer and it's par for the course. Trump will use you and dump you. I'm not sure why Kim thought she would be any different.

The death penalty never felt like justice to me. It's just revenge. A crime did happen, but the individual has been removed from society, as is necessary for the function of that society. 

But if the harm these criminals have caused is irreparable, as you said, then the death penalty is simple revenge with no gains. It's justice in word alone.

If taking another life is wrong, then let it be wrong in every situation. We can shroud it in process and procedure, but the end result is the same."

Regardless, if the death penalty exists, at least a few innocent people are going to be executed by the state. It‚Äôs more expensive than keeping them in prison for life anyway."

2169,2020-12-11 06:18:51,kaw64y,"Honestly, I hope Kanye is getting help after his breakdown earlier this year, but if he does not I hope Kim divorces him. My mom stuck around with someone who refused help for WAY too long thinking she could ‚Äúhelp‚Äù and it messed me and my siblings up something fierce. 

Ofc we don‚Äôt know the ins and outs of their relationship at all but having parents in an unhealthy or unstable marriage is really devastating for kids"
2170,2020-12-11 09:48:26,kaw64y,It still sounds so vague to me. I feel like they‚Äôll keep this going till the last season starts. The divorce speculations is the one thing that never gets old and keeps people hooked.
2171,2020-12-11 07:39:37,kaw64y,"Kanye disliked the show, so I always thought Kim considered him when she ended it. Now that they have signed a deal with Hulu, Kanye might be angry about having cameras in house again after he thought he was finally done with it. 

So Kris Jenner might be putting out feelers in case something happens. Elle is pretty big, i think. So i assume this is from Kris Jenner, though she usually uses TMZ or Entertainment Tonight as her mouth piece."
2172,2020-12-12 14:35:07,kaw64y,"I saw a People Mag short article on this about them living very separate lives right now that was posted about 14 hours ago, too."
2173,2020-12-11 09:47:16,kaw64y,"Keep in mind this ""source"" leaked it a day before the Hulu announcement, also leaked Khloe/Tristan drama was leaked too.

I remember September it was the same thing, Page Six said Kim is going leave Kanye because of his position on Abortion

Unless Kanye says something on twitter, I guarantee you he'll flip out if this was true, that's why I can't take tabloids like Entertaiment Tonight seriously....i guarantee you, this is a manufactured storyline leak by Kris camp.

You gotta look at Kim and the Kardashian family's actions vs rumors...They all supported him running, YZY Christian School for their kids."
2174,2020-12-13 17:40:55,kaw64y,They do not come across as two people in love by any stretch of the imagination. It‚Äôs a sad situation for all involved.
2175,2020-12-11 21:14:11,kaw64y,Why do you say this?
2176,2020-12-11 07:36:54,kaw64y,"I'm so sorry about your mom, I hope your family is healing.

Yeah I'm worried because she is ride or die. She delivered his food, cleaned up and was by his side 24/7 when he had COVID and she was also left alone with their kids. After all of that she had to drop her entire life to see him because he refused to get help from a doctor and she ended up going home alone."
2177,2020-12-11 10:04:19,kaw64y,"I agree, you would think Kanye would flip out if Kim is trying to leave him. Also Kim was angry @ Kanye for making their problems public....so for me, it wouldn't make sense if Kim is spilling her doubts and a source is telling us.

Also this ""source"" called Kanye crazy, Kim brave & loyal....its very clear which side leaked this LOL"
2178,2020-12-11 09:48:25,kaw64y,All of the reports today used Entertaiment tonight as their source

2180,2020-12-11 09:50:21,kaw64y,Do the kids attend yeezy Christian school?
2181,2020-12-11 21:31:01,kaw64y,"Cali Alimony law, will get her way more money in divorce"
2182,2020-12-11 11:23:41,kaw64y,"Yeezy Christian School isn't really a proper school. Its more of a summer camp sort of thing with activities and also religion. 

 The girls, P and North, used to attend Sierra Canyon school. But i think classes have been online now. I don't think the K's would ever compromise on education. When school is on campus again, i'm sure their kids will go back. 

Yeezy Christian School keeps the kids busy and teaches them about God. That's all. Its not be confused with a more robust education."
2183,2020-12-11 09:54:15,kaw64y,Yes the Kardashian clan kids and their friend's kids go to Kanye's school.
2184,2020-12-11 23:49:30,kaw64y,Isn‚Äôt she worth more than him now?
2185,2020-12-12 11:39:43,kaw64y,I mean Kris *did* have Kylie and Kendall pretty much drop out in exchange for more work- I mean ‚Äúhomeschool‚Äù. Now Stormi has a bigger vocabulary than her mother
2186,2020-12-11 15:48:06,kaw64y,I see. I was thinking it was an actual mainstream school.
2187,2020-12-12 05:30:57,kaw64y,"I'm not sure, yeezy is definitely worth more than kkw, but I don't know about overall and I also think numbers online are very inaccurate. I also don't know if I think she is waiting because of the money, but if she was waiting for 10 year mark like above user said then that would be why. I know that because that's what Vanessa Bryant did except she never went through with it."
2188,2020-12-12 05:14:05,kaw64y,No. He‚Äôs worth over $1B now...supposedly.
2189,2020-12-12 15:21:44,kaw64y,I mean thank god it‚Äôs not
2190,2020-12-12 20:48:35,kaw64y,But he still took that PPP loan tho right?
2191,2020-12-12 20:49:34,kaw64y,"Yes, but that isn‚Äôt tied to personal net worth. Tom Brady also took out a PPP loan for his business as well...he and Giselle are worth millions combined."

UK is a bit different I would imagine.

I think age makes a difference too. Im 30 and I dont know of many non-asian girls my age who are into KPop, but from what I can tell the late-teen, early 20s crowd are really into it.

The girls I tend to attract most are Fob Chinese(Asian American women dont treat me particularly well), Basic white girls, Latinas, and white-washed Black Women. Weird mix, I know."

The girls started off with KUWTK and as they've grown they've had the platform for partnerships, businesses and the capital to enjoy great lives and develop further streams of income and that's great for them. You may not be at the perfect job, you may not be at the ideal stage in business or a career and I feel like this is what everyone says when they try to sound nice and humble but I've personally had a breakthrough caused by some good and bad events in my life and I feel happy with my career and financial life but I let my health go and my drive go and my happiness go for a minute there. With all of these businesses and opportunities comes scrutiny from the media, demands from fans and so many things we don't see or consider. As we end this year I'd normally say to friends and family good luck, I hope you do well or acheive XYZ but rlly I just hope people feel content. We still have bills to pay, families to support but just make sure you're doing whatever u can to feel as best as you can."

2267,2020-12-23 15:46:56,kiqo2u,"Just in the past month or two I‚Äôve seen Kendall & Kylie post about their clothing brand. Usually when they release a new collection they promote it and tag it.

Why do u believe that Kendall owns or co-owns Moon? When I look it up, I find that she co-collaborated on the Moon pen and just promotes them."
2268,2020-12-23 15:32:33,kiqo2u,"she promotes it every once in a while, so I think she still earns money from it. It isn‚Äôt anywhere as popular as it used to be tho, so I can‚Äôt imagine that it‚Äôs a lot"
2269,2020-12-23 15:46:31,kiqo2u,Oh yh I forgot about that.  Kendall & Kylie have their own game too. It's a deal with Glu who make several of their own apps and Kim has a branded app with them so the deal is probs structured in a way that Glu handles the development and updating features and Kim promotes it occasionally and profit is split betweent the two. I swear I heard a article like 2 years ago saying the app generates like 10-20 million every single year. If it is true that's great because Kim rarely promotes it.
2270,2020-12-23 17:00:34,kiqo2u,Just personal opinion but I cannot stand the name.  Then again Goop gives me hives.
2271,2020-12-23 16:50:25,kiqo2u,"I do. Kourtney's storylines over the past few seasons involve her and Kim arguing over gluten free stuff for the kids party, her not being able to understand Kim and Khloe because on top of having kids they have successful companies to run whilst at the time all she wanted to do was film and be with the kids. Poosh is very much about Kourtney but they release several articles a day and most of them aren't even all about Kourtney or written by her and these articles cover health, beauty, home decor e.t.c and Poosh isn't as big as KKW BEAUTY, Kylie Cosmetics, Good American or Skims but Poosh have a loyal audience who are interested and they have many revenue streams. Poosh is doing just fine. From my background in digital marketing and social media marketing I can assure you that Kourtney has made and can made at least a few million dollars from Poosh."
2272,2020-12-23 15:52:13,kiqo2u,"

She's a investor/co-owner. Here are a few articles proving that:

2273,2020-12-23 19:35:08,kiqo2u,When quarantine started I saw a lot of people going back to it on Tiktok so I assume while it‚Äôs not as popular some people still play it
2274,2020-12-23 15:49:03,kiqo2u,I just found this [variety article](https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/kim-kardashian-hollywood-brings-in-8-million-1202896344/) from 2018 saying the app made Glu 8 million. Kim would obviously get a cut of that and it seemed to have been increasing in revenue but I haven't heard much about the app since.
2275,2020-12-23 21:36:04,kiqo2u,I read that it is what put Kim on the map as an actual entrepreneur!
2276,2020-12-24 00:10:26,kiqo2u,It reminds me of Girl Croosh from Bojack Horseman.
2277,2020-12-23 16:16:33,kiqo2u,"For that first link its say the ‚ÄúJenner co-created the product with brand‚Äù , and that she ‚Äúcame on board once the majority of the development was in place following liaisons with Beach House Group Co-Owner Shaun Neff.‚Äù Also that they need help to promote the brand so they showed Kris then Kendall, ‚ÄúI knew we had to place the right person to help us develop and push and market the product.‚Äú[Kris] loved the brand, and we were like, let‚Äôs show Kendall. When we showed her the name and the look and feel [of the brand], and the concept of oral beauty, she just loved it.‚Äù

The second link, states pretty much the same thing. ‚ÄúWWD‚Äôs insider claims that Jenner is a financial backer of Moon. However, a representative for the brand clarified to BAZAAR.com that ‚ÄúKendall is actually not an investor in Moon. She co-collaborated with the brand and she helped create the Whitening Pen.‚Äù‚Äù

The third link, I couldn‚Äôt read because I need an account.

I went on the Moon Oral Care website and looked at the About Me page. It says, ‚ÄúOur founder Shaun Neff created MOON to transform the oral care experience into something new entirely. Better design. Better-for-you ingredients. A commitment to supporting healthy smiles around the world. Because when we rethink the way things have always been, we‚Äôre able to create something truly original. It‚Äôs when oral care is reimagined into an experience all its own.‚Äù In another section for Kendall it says, ‚ÄúInspired to bring a new, elevated oral care experience, Shaun Neff partnered with fashion icon Kendall Jenner to co-create Kendall‚Äôs signature product, the Teeth Whitening Pen.‚Äù

Her name is only on the Teeth Whitening Pen. I found nothing to claim that she is investor or co-owner."
2278,2020-12-23 16:43:44,kiqo2u,"The title of the first link says Kendall is an investor and the rest of the article goes on to talk about her co-creating it. WWD has been around since 1910 and are a established publication in fashion, cosmetics and business and WWD have covered acquisitions, investments and mergers concerning Nike, Coty and big businesses for decade. WWD is more credible than Harper's Bazaar in business and Harper's Bazaar only wrote the article seeing as Kendall is a model. There was a accident at a Bazaar party during fashion week, they've been sued for selling subscriber info, an intern of their sued them. HB claimed that Kim was a billionaire after Coty's investment even though that rumour was debunked by Forbes, Cosmopolitan and several other accredited publications so I'm not really going to believe HB in this instance cause they are hella shady. Kendall has used her smile for shoots with Calvin Klein, Vogue and Victoria's Secret so her teeth need to look good all the time on camera so she's the perfect person to be involved in the pen line.

> Her name is only on the Teeth Whitening Pen. I found nothing to claim that she is invester or co-owner. 

Just because someone invests in a  company doesn't mean their name needs to be on every single product. I would consider buying the Kendall pen because I may be interested in having her white teeth but I wouldn't want her name on my toothpaste or any of the other Moon products. 

By definition an investor provides capital in return for a percentage of ownership in the company."

2286,2020-12-19 21:30:23,kgg7gx,"I love this, but I don‚Äôt see any of them as the Lannisters. They have big Tyrell energy. They‚Äôre seen as lowbrow celebs and new money, just like the Tyrells were never kings like the other wardens. Also Kris was a flight attendent, Kim was a closet organiser. Their dad was just a lawyer, meanwhile their friends were related to big celebs. Just like the Tyrells worked as servants under the Gardeners before they got the south. They‚Äôre kind of looked down upon, and everyone can see through them. The Tyrells play both sides and stay neutral just like the Karjenners. All they want is more prestige and power. Even their motto ‚ÄúGrowing strong‚Äù and the rose is very Karjenner. 

Kris reminds me of Olenna Redwyne: intense, social, and cunning. She does everything in her power to push the Tyrells up the ladder. 

Kim is Margaery, beautiful and really nice, has an extremely high EQ, and social climbs through relationships. 

Kanye reminds me of Dany, well intentioned but short sighted, inexperienced and entitled so he ends up doing damage. They both want to rule despite not having much support from the actual citizens.

I can‚Äôt really place the other ones, the GOT characters are so specific."
2287,2020-12-19 21:41:45,kgg7gx,LOL thanks for sharing. Absolute roast of Kourtney being Joffrey Baratheon üòÇüòÇüòÇ
2288,2020-12-19 21:36:43,kgg7gx,Omg JC as Littlefinger is too perfect. But I see Scott as a bit of a LF too.

This is perfect!! They are definitely Tyrells, not Lannisters or Starks. I was just comparing certain traits they share with the characters.


>Kris reminds me of Olenna Redwyne

I can't believe I forgot about 'tell cersei it was me'. Both icons!! Her cunning is more Olenna than Tywin.

>Kim is Margaery

This is the perfect Kim comparision. I was honestly struggling to place her, I even thought of Kylie as Margaery but then was like she doesn't have her charm or mind. Kim is perfect as her.

>Kanye reminds me of Dany, well intentioned but short sighted, inexperienced and entitled so he ends up doing damage

I really wanted a Dany comparision, and I could think of no one but then your comparision of Kanye makes absolute sense. A people's chosen hero gone wrong.

If any others come into your mind, you have to comment. Your comparisions really clicked!!"
2294,2020-12-19 21:38:39,kgg7gx,"JC as Littlefinger is the comparision that as soon as it clicked, I was like I have to write this down!!"

2312,2020-12-17 21:09:34,kf5xgw,"It can be a good learning exercise to do things like this. But you need to source your birth data via Astrodatabank. And not use unverified data. Kardashian has an AA rating on her birth data. However, West does not - it's unusable, with a rating of X. That is, there is no proven birth time for him. So, your analysis above isn't reliable, I'm afraid.

Here's what [astrodatabank has to say about West's lack of data](https://www.astro.com/astro-databank/West,_Kanye):

 *A time of 8:45 AM comes from a blog post by Matthew Currie.* [*\[2\]*](http://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/ohmystars/2013/09/imma-let-uranus-and-pluto-finish-the-astrology-of-kanye-west.html) *Lynn Hayes writes, ""There is an unverified birth time for Kanye of 8:45 am floating around the internet... Chris Brennan wrote about this on his blog in 2015. Apparently at that time Astrotheme listed a 2007 interview with Blender Magazine as the source of the birth time. Chris went so far as to order a back issue of that interview, and the birth time was not cited there. The Astrotheme webmaster wrote in a comment to this article that they had received this tip in an email and because they are French they couldn‚Äôt read the article and didn‚Äôt verify the time. Chris mentioned in this article that Matthew Currie had written a post on Kanye West and cited this birthtime from Astrotheme. At some point after that 2015 discussion on Chris Brennan‚Äôs blog, Astrotheme changed the source of the 8:45 am birth time from Blender Magazine to Matthew Currie‚Äôs article.""*  

Astrodatabank is the gold standard for birth data for public figures. Astrotheme has no standing in this matter."
