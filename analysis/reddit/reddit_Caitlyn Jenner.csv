1,2020-02-05 13:58:43,ez9tut,Hilarious. You must be so proud of this witty comment.
2,2020-02-03 21:22:07,eydxlk,"I agree but disagree at the same time. They are putting their lives in the internet, pretty much asking for people to critique their lives. They do dumb shit a lot of the times and although I don't follow any of them, I'm always seeing them on my timeline. In the end, hating on them equal more publicity so I guess it's a win win. I love how all of them got in their bags though"
3,2020-02-03 21:33:50,eydxlk,"I think people who hate the Kardashians are like the people who boo the heels in wrestling shows. They've lost their sense of unreality. 

The Kardashians are extremely good at what they do, which is to profit off of entertaining other people. Being a certain way, doing certain things, and saying certain things so that it invokes judgement, criticism, or adoration, these just get them more fame and more money. 

I used to hate the Kardashians because I was resentful of the fact that they were rich for no reason, and when I came to the realization I shared here, I began to like them. They're performers who are good at evoking responses so they deserve the money they get."
4,2020-02-03 22:10:18,eydxlk,They are a waste of space as far as I'm concerned.
5,2020-02-03 21:08:53,eydxlk,Who’s Caitlyn? I know a Bruce Jenner they committed manslaughter.
6,2020-02-03 21:45:28,eydxlk,"I’m just turned off by trashiness. To me, they epitomize trash. They’re celebrated for the wrong reasons. They brag. They lie. They manipulate. They’re vain. They bully. They will remind you of their wealth whether provoked or not. That’s not what the world needs at this moment. It really comes down to this: Are you a Christian? Christians don’t support their views on life. We believe in being humble, selfless, and having good intentions to further the evidence of a loving God. Are you not a Christian or a non-believer? Then you probably don’t care what people do, because a moral compass nor has the word of God been introduced to you. It really comes down to that. Christian versus Non-Christian values. Simple as day and night."

8,2020-02-03 22:07:27,eydxlk,Well your supposed to boo heels in wrestling but that’s a different story. I almost agree with you except the Kardashians are not performers. Performers have a talent and get paid for that talent or performance. The kardashians are no better then any instagram “influencer”
9,2020-02-03 21:46:55,eydxlk,[deleted]
10,2020-02-03 21:19:51,eydxlk,Type in Caitlyn Jenner you’ll see who she is.
11,2020-02-03 21:56:58,eydxlk,"Look at Twitter. If you do dumb shit people are going to call you out. People criticized others all the time and even though the media goes overboard with the insults, it's part of the package deal. Not everyone is going to like them. I admire certain things they do especially Kim but I still don't like them. And I'm not saying it is right to berate them because it's not, it's just gonna happen. But they cop their bags and living like better than most so jokes on the haters I guess"
12,2020-02-03 22:04:35,eydxlk,A lot of the hate is the bad influence they put on the younger generation. All the fame was because of a slutty act and now the whole family is successful from doing nothing. Then we have young girls who idolize them hoping they can be like successful like them when it’s not possible. Any business they would of tried to start would have failed had it not been for the publicity that Kim got them with her sex tape.
13,2020-02-03 22:22:42,eydxlk,"But that's what I'm trying to say. A performer is someone who basically lies about who they are in a way that gives people an emotional response, and that generates a demand, which justifies them being paid. Everything in their lives is scripted and designed despite them hocking it as reality tv. Just like wrestling."
14,2020-02-03 21:48:17,eydxlk,No I seriously don’t know who this Caitlyn Jenner is. Is that the name of Kylie’s baby?
15,2020-02-03 21:23:06,eydxlk,Looked it up. All I could find was Bruce. Apparently he was an Olympic star. Who knew?
16,2020-02-03 22:16:18,eydxlk,[deleted]
17,2020-02-03 21:23:58,eydxlk,Wait is she trans?
18,2020-02-04 00:11:07,eydxlk,You’re correct most sex tapes don’t result in that. However this was that 1 in a million time when it did. I could say with full confidence that that family would not have a billion dollar empire without that tape.
19,2020-02-03 21:25:19,eydxlk,Who’s she?
20,2020-02-01 23:51:56,excl8v,"Just go to a standard gay bar, not a drag place.

Drag places are probably better suited for the queens that are totally comfortable with their gender and sexuality that the ""shade"" is considered humorous as it's an extreme interpretation of feminine traits."
21,2020-02-01 21:24:26,excl8v,"My heart breaks for her.  That is terrible thing to have happen, and on the night of a chosen celebration.  

That being said, maybe a drag show wasn't the best idea, they definitely like to ""read"" the audience and the harsher they are the more laughs they get... I myself have been picked out of the crowd and had something I'm self-conscious about literally put in the spot light... Twice. Two separate shows in two separate states... So...

I'm a big believer that members of the trans community are some of the strongest out there in the alphabet soup.  They are proudly willing to be exactly who they are in spite of still being killed for it, even here in the ""first world"".

Keep being an awesome friend and help remind her that no one's comments have any effect on how strong and proud she should be."
22,2020-02-01 23:32:39,excl8v,I think this is similar to going to a comedy show and a comedian pokes fun at your appearance. It’s possible the drag queen didn’t mean ill intent towards your friend and was playing up their character. For the future don’t attend these events if you aren’t for having shade thrown at you. Also support your friend and reassure her that what the drag queen said meant nothing and was probably just a poor joke that didn’t hit home.
23,2020-02-01 23:55:27,excl8v,"

First off: goddamn that sucks. 

This is what drag shows are like tbh. I've been to a few  (straight dude, if it matters), and I've been singled out each time and hit on in a pretty outrageous manner (one told me I looked like if James Franco had eaten a really big breakfast, and then she said she'd like to 'pound the pudding right outta me'. Which, fair enough tbh I am a little chubby but I also found it hilarious) and that's how it goes. 


I'd address this overtly with your friend, and honestly show her this thread."
24,2020-02-02 00:58:10,excl8v,In future I'd advise against expecting a space that hosts drag to be trans friendly. It's an unfortunate truth that many spaces that bill themselves as LGBT spaces really just tolerate the T at most.
25,2020-02-02 01:14:01,excl8v,"""I can see why you sat in the dark."" Is a pretty stock-zinger that I imagine gets used in the act on a regular basis.
Bad timing.
Tell your friend so."
26,2020-02-02 00:10:26,excl8v,Are there any trans bars specifically you could take her to? Fresh start? I find it really odd a drag queen of all people would make comments like that to her?
27,2020-02-02 00:41:33,excl8v,"if you want to go to drag shows, I might suggest looking at smaller indie scenes that are more trans inclusive -- I know Commercial Drag, a local show here in Vancouver, has a cast largely made up of trans people who do drag and that creates a much more inclusive atmosphere. I might also ask any trans folks you know where they like to go/do to celebrate themselves. Gay bars are notorious for being trans exclusive, in my experience, but maybe there are smaller events that are more gender inclusive in your scene (:"
28,2020-02-01 23:56:34,excl8v,"I’m curious what was said about Caitlyn Jenner; I’ve heard some jokes about her that are non-transphobic, including some from her directly. 

If the drag queen literally said, “I can see why you sat in the dark,” I’d discourage your friend from linking that to her transition. That’s a pretty vague dis that the drag queen could have said to literally anyone, without even actually looking at the person. I would encourage her to keep that in mind!"
29,2020-02-01 23:20:31,excl8v,">Tonight, we had a night out and rounded off our night at a gay cabaret with a drag queen...

I already know where this is heading, and I already feel for your friend. I feel like I'm watching the train about to hit your friend and can't get to them in time as I read this.

>...in a place that's meant to be a safe space.

No, it's not. It's not meant to be a safe space in any way, shape or form. Just because you slap ""LGBT"" on something doesn't mean that everyone is going to cover you in bubble wrap and protect your feelings. We're real people too.

Taking your friend to this event was an absolutely horrible idea. The whole point is that they walk around talking shit and being funny. That's literally the entire point.

In the spirit of the event you went to, here is my advice for both you and your friend: It's a joke, not a dick. Don't take it so hard."
30,2020-02-01 23:00:20,excl8v,[deleted]
31,2020-02-01 23:01:15,excl8v,"That is just awful, poor Jenny.  I would have been crushed.  All you can do for Jenny is help pick her up and find somewhere safe to take her out again.

However, I think you need to try to stop this happening to someone else.  You could contact the bar and let them and the performer know what happened, and what effect it had.  You could suggest to them that if that is going to be the nature of their shows that they make people aware beforehand that it isn't a safe space for those who are transitioning.  Maybe they could put on their website something to describe the show's possible tone.

Alternatively/as well leave a trip advisor, Google review etc letting people know what to expect."
32,2020-02-01 21:40:34,excl8v,"Remind your friend that there was no truth in what was said, only transphobia and ask her if she’d like to talk it through or if you can contact the bar on her behalf or if you guys could do something else together to show how proud you are of her.

It’s really helpful generally when you experience discrimination as a marginalised group when an ally stands up for you but in a way that gives autonomy back so they can agree to you calling the bar and feel supported but not like your upset needs handled as well as theirs.

It also means you don’t accidentally out someone while being well meaning. So ask what your friend needs and then listen and follow it through basically.

You sound like a lovely person with genuine intentions and you validating her hurt and feelings will do a lot in and of itself even if it can’t make up for all the damage someone else did.

And don’t beat yourself up. As a member of the LGBTQ+ community I’m always furious when that community plays ‘you can’t sit at our table’ bullshit instead of supporting each other and we should always be bettering ourselves. Drag humour can be sharp and shady without punching down and anything else is just cruel and lazy."
33,2020-02-02 02:56:34,excl8v,"Wow. As a non-binary drag performer I'm furious at this. In my area, this would be unacceptable. Drag was literally started by transgender and non-binary people. In fact, Stonewall and the gay rights movement in the US was thanks to trans women, who were poor and probably couldn't ""pass"" well either. It must be so painful for your friend to feel ostracized not only by general society but in a gay bar of all places! Yes, drag queens can be shady, but unless someone is really acting out, you don't punch down like that person did.

I think your friend was upset because she had hoped you would share the same anger she did and not play it off with a joke. I get that you did the best that you could though, I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. I would absolutely complain about this on Yelp or Google Reviews. Caitlyn Jenner jokes? WTF, it's 2020. I would imagine this queen had done similar things and transphobic drag performers should not do what they're doing. To make it right to your friend, I would try in the future to stand up to them more. The next time someone starts a joke, show your disapproval or say, ""this is gross, let's get out of here."" 

P.S. the best way to make sure this gets back to the drag queen in question is to find out who is in charge of promoting/hosting the cabaret or party and give them feedback. Transphobia should be 100% a no-no. And float this feedback to the venue as well, which gets to put its foot down against shows or performers. Really sorry to hear this happened."
34,2020-02-02 01:40:19,excl8v,"I'm not involved in this side of the tracks whatsoever, but would it be possible to email the drag queen and tell her about the situation? I know it sounds mad and external validation from this person really shouldn't be necessary, but an apology and a but of validation might just be a good salve for what is, essentially, bruised ego"
35,2020-02-01 21:27:30,excl8v,"I'm sorry you've had that experience. We hadn't known going in that it was going to be an issue, but in hindsight I can see where the issue has come from. I won't be going in again with my friend and I won't be going in separately."
36,2020-02-02 00:59:47,excl8v,Lesson learned. I think we're going to stick to our usual haunts in future.
37,2020-02-02 00:55:14,excl8v,I find it utterly unsurprising considering how transphobic drag often is.
38,2020-02-02 00:40:24,excl8v,"I did a quick google and it doesn't look like there are any trans bars in our region of the country. I may look into that, though."
39,2020-02-02 03:06:34,excl8v,"I haven't really heard of bars geared towards trans people in general and I know a lot of bars in San Francisco. Granted, these are old establishments and a lot of the smaller places have shut down. Oftentimes, there are some bars that are more friendly than others. Lesbian-friendly bars might be a better bet. Unfortunately even at these spaces there have been times where my trans friends have experienced discrimination. There are assholes everywhere, but those assholes definitely shouldn't be the ones holding a mike."
40,2020-02-02 03:27:16,excl8v,"this! <3 

There are great events hosted by my local LGBT center in Oakland. Not all drag bars are created equal. Some are white, some cater to an older crowd, or cruisers, or leather enthusiasts. Check the yelp reviews and see what kind of folks like to go there and what they think of it or some issues that have appeared."
41,2020-02-02 00:42:50,excl8v,[deleted]
42,2020-02-02 01:07:14,excl8v,">I do think you should contact the bar

This would be like contacting a baseball stadium and complaining because they played a baseball game there. OP and OP's friend would get roasted beyond belief."
43,2020-02-02 00:56:42,excl8v,The bar won't do anything. They went to a show where the audience is roasted for their looks. This was bound to happen.
44,2020-02-01 23:43:37,excl8v,">You could contact the bar and let them and the performer know what happened, and what effect it had

I'm sure the performer knew exactly what they were doing, it is pretty typical for drag queen humor after all. That said, the bar might be open to putting a disclaimer saying that these shows are ""no holds barred"" so that people aren't caught unprepared in the future."
45,2020-02-02 01:07:43,excl8v,">only transphobia

Wrong. It was a drag show. It was a generic joke that would have applied to anyone. It had nothing to do with being trans."
46,2020-02-01 21:45:09,excl8v,Hopefully one day that changes.
47,2020-02-02 01:03:59,excl8v,You may want to try looking at trans online communities to vet establishments beforehand. It's saved me a lot of hassle.
48,2020-02-02 00:45:46,excl8v,Or even just a diff bar! Best of luck!
49,2020-02-02 03:22:59,excl8v,"lol are y'all gay? or regularly go to drag shows rather than watch Drag Race? cuz a drag cabaret is nothing like a comedy show or sports show. 

the entire point of LGBTQ establishments is to make a space where queer people can be themselves.

You make fun of straight people, you make fun of shitty politicians, you make fun of someone wearing a weird orange t-shirt or something, you do NOT make random trans people feel like shit for even being there. I don't know where this happened but if this happened in San Francisco, we'd get this queen excommunicated. There is CONSTANT dialogue about the issues of white queens taking up too much space, racism, transphobia, and fatphobia. You don't tell someone to have thick skin when trans women have the highest homicide and suicide rates."
50,2020-02-02 01:26:08,excl8v,That's a good idea. I think I'll do that in future.
51,2020-02-02 00:47:57,excl8v,We have some other bars we go to so I think we'll stick to those. Thank you. :)
52,2020-02-01 20:54:22,excd8t,That is absolutely horrible.
53,2020-02-01 22:26:22,excd8t,"I'm sorry about your and your friend's experience.  I understand that you feel guilty, but there really wasn't any way that you could have anticipated that things would go as they did.

In reality, there aren't so many safe places for trans people.  Gay and lesbian establishments aren't an exception.  Neither are drag shows.  If you've seen Ru Paul, you might remember that the contestants who essentially looked female (rather than comic drag) weren't well liked by the other contestants.  Drag is humour, and sometimes very sharp humor.  In contrast, trans women are very conscious of our appearance and can easily be hurt.

I don't know if engaging the bar or the person who did the act would help.  Its possible that the drag queen would feel bad and want to talk or communicate with your friend about her feelings.  Or they might be caustic as heck and not care.  Impossible to know how it might go.

For me, if I go out (rare), I go to typical establishments.  I know that normally I'm not welcome in gay and lesbian bars, so I don't go.  I enjoyed watching Ru Paul, but I'd not want to be confused with a drag queen, so I wouldn't go to a drag show in person.  Just too much risk of someone saying something to me assuming I'm a queen and not trans.  Do I want to risk being hurt?

I know, it seemed like a great idea.  Its a shame that its not something that's worth the risk.  Just talk, let her vent, and try a regular club or bar next time :)  \*hugs\*"
54,2020-02-01 22:08:53,excd8t,"It sounds like this person doing drag is at least a small bit trans-phobic. 

The person doing drag should only be making fun of themselves and certainly shouldn't be making jokes about transgender people. We have little to do with drag, except maybe being patrons at your drag show.

I know its mainly men who are drag queens, but I don't see a reason why a CIS woman or a transgender woman couldn't work doing drag. Its an art form and so as long as you are good at your craft, gender shouldn't have much to do with you doing that art form.

RuPaul got in trouble for trans-phobia, these are the type of drag queens we should shun, the good ones make fun of themselves, not transgender as we are not drag queens, we are woman or men born in the wrong body. Drag Queens just pretend to be women to make money."
55,2020-02-02 01:39:56,excd8t,Drag culture is disgusting sometimes
56,2020-02-02 04:46:44,excd8t,"Some drag queens are absolute assholes to trans people. I don’t know what motivates them, but it happens."
57,2020-02-02 07:08:34,excd8t,"I've found that most of my experiences with drag queens are incredibly transphobic unless the drag queen also happens to be transgender. I even was gatekeep'd by one because I have no chin and am a transman (""you're gonna need to actually have surgery on that face, and until then you're just a stupid girl""). 

Tell her that drag queen was a complete douchebag. Because it's the truth. Definately complain to the bar about this because your friend was genuinely hurt by that employee's behavior. And don't let them shrug it off with ""they're performers who come here they're not employees"" cuz that doesn't matter. They enabled the situation to occur."
58,2020-02-02 08:21:20,excd8t,"Have a girl's night. Inside. You can wear pajamas, watch movies, wear face masks, do each other's nails. Fun stuff. That's what I would do. :)"
59,2020-02-02 02:10:32,excd8t,"There's shade and then there's being a bitch.

Try a different bar or the same one on a different night."
60,2020-02-02 01:34:40,excd8t,"Just continue being a good friend.  It already sounds like you've done much of whatever you can about the incident. I definitely think you should make a complaint to the bar. 

Firstly, the bar need to know this isn't acceptable. Second, it shows that you're there for her and not just paying lip service to being supportive. Your friend will most definitely appreciate the gesture. You're willing to actually do thibgs to support her. Thirdly, your voice adds weight to any complaints your friend or anyone else makes."
61,2020-02-01 22:49:48,excd8t,"I think making a complaint to the bar owner would help.

Unpopular opinion but I find people that do drag really offending and very uncaring of transgender people that struggle with passing. The culture of associating it with art keeps it from being recognized as blackface taboo in comparison to transgender people. The fact is that it creates multiple negative messages that people try to downplay."
62,2020-02-02 03:44:33,excd8t,"White cis gay men having the audacity to be transphobic irks me so fucking much, they wouldn't have any of the rights they have today if not for radical black trans women fighting for them. Absolutely tell the bar about this situation, that drag queen will think twice about being transphobic after losing a gig."
63,2020-02-02 05:29:06,excd8t,"Honestly fuck that queen. Drag is not the problem though y'all! I will defend it to my last breath. Drag can be a really beautiful and powerful form of gender play. At its best, drag queens are channelling their own creative energy into expressing something that they feel unable to express within the confines of masculinity and malehood. It can be respectful and even reverent. And for a very long time there wasn't really a distinction between queens and trans women. That's where the phrase ""full time"" came from.   


The bitter, takedown style comedy is something that grew out of the perception that queens have the toughest skin and they're nobody you want to fuck with. It was originally a form of self defense that came from years of transphobic harassment. You could beat the shit out of a drag queen but she'd still be able to get under your skin. These days it's just expected to be part of the routine.  


The problem is that trans women have a much easier time transitioning and being accepted as women these days, which means that queens are increasingly those who have no interest in transition, i.e. cis gay men. There's much less of a community between queens and trans women, and so cis gay men end up being just as transphobic as your average cis person.  


This night at the bar is a huge red flag about the establishment. It's a sign that they either don't keep tabs on the performers they put on stage or they just don't care. It's worth reaching out to the managers or whomever- maybe they'll be super apologetic, which would be a good sign- but my hunch is that the bar just might not be the safe space that your friend needs it to be, which sucks. Hopefully it's not the only one in the area!"
64,2020-02-02 03:01:21,excd8t,"Yeah, that wasn't drag humor. That's a well off drag performer who likely doesn't face any discrimination in their daily life and ended up being a transphobe because he probably sees the LGBT struggle as mostly done and over with, besides the pesky transes which should step aside and do their own thing. I'm making a lot of assumptions here, but that mentality is kind of prevalent among gay men who live in liberal areas."
65,2020-02-02 13:02:56,excd8t,Any lgbt member that shits on another member of the lgbt community is worse than dirt. Pathetic.
66,2020-02-02 07:29:43,excd8t,"This is a good example of why drag queens piss me off. I would complain to that bar, and if they didn’t reprimand that drag queen, blast them about it on yelp. We need access to safe spaces, and the last thing we need is some cis gay men trying to deny us that."
67,2020-02-02 07:33:32,excd8t,"I'm sorry your friend experienced this, not really your fault though. 

Drag queens definitely give me the aura of gay men who are very entitled. They'd like to believe they suffer as much discrimination as trans women when they obviously don't. And playing dress-up is not the same as trying to fix dysphoria."
68,2020-02-02 02:17:26,excd8t,Let your friend know that she is not alone and there are trans people here agreeing and knowing that what that person said was cruel and transphobic. Validate her. Love her.
69,2020-02-02 01:48:21,excd8t,Ugh. I teared up reading this. I wish I could make this experience go away for your friend.
70,2020-02-02 08:05:26,excd8t,"I love drag, but that queen sounds catty, transphobic, and unfunny. I think the best thing you can do for your friend is exactly what you did- urge her not to take the drag queen's comments to heart. 

As a trans person it can be a tough thing to realize that many *gay*-friendly spaces aren't *trans*-friendly places. As much as it sucks, you kind of have to just vet it out space-by-space or go by word of mouth. Best of luck to you and your friend."
71,2020-02-02 09:55:28,excd8t,"Honestly, it's a shit thing to happen but it's probably just time to sit back for a minute. Keep hanging out with her, keep listening to her and if she wants to do anything about it or try somewhere else, then go for it.

You can, if you like, say something to the bar on your own behalf. It's really not a good idea for a bar to be inviting guests who will make patrons uncomfortable and at the very least they will want to know if customers have had a bad experience at their bar. I'd recommend talking to other people to see if they've had similar experiences and see how the bar respond. If you're lucky, they'll hopefully take that on board. If not, then it's probably best to just let it lie and leave it to your pal to let others know if they want to."
72,2020-02-02 01:27:48,excd8t,"That sucks, yeah I am MTF and have had bad exp with drag queens and gay men. Got beat up for going into a gay bar and they threaten to kick my cis girlfriend ass. This was 20 years ago things ain't changed. They are very territorial."
73,2020-02-02 01:44:13,excd8t,"I would definitely drop a note to the establishment that this happened.  I wouldn't make it mad or mean, just kind of tell them what you told us.  I feel so badly for her being so happy to be out and herself after keeping it inside for so long.  To have that happen in a supposed safe place?  Just damn.  I can almost feel it for her, and I absolutely hate it.  As to what you can do for her, just let her know that you are there as a friend and for support.  You can't undo what happened.  It is going to hurt as much as she will allow it to hurt her.  Just let her know that you have her back.  Another suggestion is to do something for her without talking about the incident that lets her know that you see the woman she is.  That is what would work for me"

Like, the town I live in is *very* liberal & *very* progressive, with lots of people tooting their horn about being trans allies, etc. Thing is, that mainly means I don't need to worry as much about being raped/murdered, but harassment is still rampant because people are people.

If people aren't successful in direct harassment, then apparently they'll switch to appealing to mob mentality with false accusations & victim-blaming. Sort of like the scene in \*Silver Linings Playbook\* where a crowd turns against Bradley Cooper's character. Yeah, something like that happened to me & I was worried about getting shot or arrested when I was just trying to buy groceries.

That seems to work because people are generally really scared of each other now & that makes them surprisingly unpredictable & dangerous. Honestly, long-term, we need to find a way to be a lot less afraid of each other & understand each other more complexly.

Drawing battle lines just makes us more scared & more dangerous to each other. Some of the same people going on about being \*so enlightened\* & \*on the right side of history\* often end up tearing apart people they're supposedly allied with.

It's not about drawing the right lines between us but trying to understand each other. Sorry for the rant. Hope this helps."

How do two women look like a straight couple? How would you even know they were a couple? They could easily be a gay crossdresser guy and a gay woman. Even if they were a straight couple how would you know one or both of them isn't bisexual or they are poly? Just because a couple looks straight doesn't mean everyone in it is.

As a bisexual trans guy I'm sick and tired of gay cis people whining about heteronrmativity and then automatically erasing and trying to exclude anyone who doesn't look gay enough to them.

Sure, but there's two ways of looking at the situation - the negative ""cis couple with a kink"", or the positive ""newbie tran visiting a space that could be safe"". And if it's the latter but you treat it like the former, you could seriously damage someone who is in a very vulnerable state.

I mean, the first time I went to an LGBT (Drag) event *as Tabitha*, I looked like a fucking mess with my utterly dire makeup and tottering about on my platform heels, but rather than give me shit for it, the queen in charge asked if I was a new queen and when I explained, no, *the other thing*, she gave me a hug and a compliment.

""you tote look like a straight couple with a kink, going out just for this show.""

there is no evidence of that in the OP. that makes it feel a bit transphobic to me. since Jenny was presenting as a woman that was not how they looked

here's a fourth thing, they're not appropriating ""gay culture"", that's a lazy thing to say. they passively consumed a show. in general that kind of passive consumption is not in itself sufficient to constitute appropriation although people will often say otherwise because they want to engage in a bit of terminological trafficking that reduces the punch of the charge by trivializing it

here's a fifth thing, you describe the bar as a gay bar. but its described in the OP as an LGBT bar, hosting a gay cabaret event. many bars self-designate as gay bars, but because trans and gay folk have a lot of mutual solidarity, these are *very often* intended to provide for the lgbt community in general."

*  **Do your homeworks first.** I find many performers on the humour scene to be offensive. They love to laugh about public and private figures. Or they fill their speech with slurs and 4 letter words. I don't like either of that and stay away. If you go out when they have a show, try to know who is performing and try to find a website or a few YouTube clips (long ones to make sure they didn't single out something out of context).

* If you write to the club or especially to the public (social media orvnewspapers), be precise.  
– It was a safe environment, as nobody was beaten. However, it was a horribly uncomfortable one.  
– If I read correctly, the problem was with the performer and their performance. For the venue owner, the issue is that they need to do a better selection of who they get on stage.  
– If anything, I would hope for some kind of amendment from the performer. Probably not an apology, but their next shows should be less abrasive.

Finally, depending on the fame of the club or the  artist, be weary of the backlash. There is a case of a Québec artist who was sent to the courts by someone who felt offended by the humourist's show. The offended guy won (and I think rightly so), but many media outlets have sided with the famous humourist unfortunately. So just make sure whatever you move doesn't fall in your face."

While gay people deserve exclusively gay spaces free of straight people trans people can be gay and therefore deserve to be in those spaces.

That would be like saying it's okay for gay bars to exclude black gays if they make white gays uncomfortable.

   It's shit that the concept of trans people is hated and shat on so much so that we're slaughtered on the streets (poc more so, and black trans women the most), but drag is NOT equivalent to blackface. Drag doesn't mock trans people and turn them into the butt of a joke. It does, however, highlight that trans people aren't allowed to dress in a typical binary fashion while cis people are allowed to do so either for humour or without as much hatred, sometimes even celebration. Drag is just crossing gender boundaries and the construct of gender. Blackface is meant to dehumanize and insult black people, making it seem like their skin is something that can be put off and taken off at any time and as if thought it's a costume where as gender is a constant performance and clothes are just apart of that performance. 

   Comparing it to blackface is so inappropriate, even more so it's made by a non-POC, more specifically non-black people."

It was something that was completely excluded from society for *thousands* of years almost *everywhere*.  Being blatantly transphobic is still socially acceptable in most places. Basic lgbt acceptance as we know it today has only existed for less than 50 years out of *all of human history*, and even now it isn’t even that widespread globally, especially if we are talking about trans people. LGBT rights are hardly even secured, we are at a constant existential threat. Queer people are often completely alone, without any people like them nearby.

What makes queer issues less serious than others? I hear stuff like this a lot and I can’t understand it. It’s really feels to me like being lgbt is considered not actually real, “all in your head”. 


It’s not a competition for who is the most oppressed, and it was queer people wouldn’t be losing it. 

LGBT people are a group that is only very very recently getting some acceptance, and it is extremely useful to use metaphors from older civil rights movement to get a point across. The concepts from these older movements are already well known and better understood by society compared to queer people, so it is very helpful to make parallels to help people understand our issues. Someone may already accept people of other races but not queer people, making these parallels is useful for that."

226,2020-02-04 16:40:37,excd8t,"\>  What makes queer issues less serious than others?

I am not saying that queer issues are less serious, but they're different. Everyone has certain aspects of themselves that grant them privilege and most people have things about them that lead to them being marginalized. As queer people we have to be aware of how we're interacting with our privileged identities while we're advocating on behalf of our marginalized identities. 

For example, I'm trans, queer, and a woman, but I'm also white. I experience transphobia, homophobia, and misogyny but I don't experience racism. I don't know what it's like for black people to be confronted with someone doing blackface. I don't have any basis to speak on that experience. It would be wrong of me to make *any* comparison with blackface, because I don't have any basis to make that comparison.

It would be like me saying, ""New York City is a terrible place to live in, like Moscow"". I can accurately speak on the experience of living in NYC, because I have done that, but I've never lived in Moscow. 

Now if a black trans person wants to say, ""When I see someone doing drag it feels the same way that seeing someone do blackface feels"", that's different. That's more like someone saying, ""I have lived in both NYC and Moscow, and I assure you, they're equally terrible places to live"". 

When you don't have the experience to speak on and you're using that experience as a narrative device to build empathy for your own struggle, you're essentially robbing the people who actually do have that experience of their ability to speak authentically about it. What if Moscow is actually a wonderful place to live? What if I made an uninformed judgement about the city because I saw a few pictures and thought it was dirty? Can you understand why people who think Moscow is a great place to live would be upset with me for speaking about the city without having lived there? 

The problem becomes more severe when it's not just about quality of life in various cities. Blackface is not just something that exists in the past. It's a phenomenon that happens and that black people in the US have to deal with currently. It's doing a disservice to black people to speak on their experiences secondhand. Black queer people exist and we should defer to them to make any sort of comparison, as they're the only people who can speak accurately about it."

Yeah, I think this is the misunderstanding. There were a lot of trans people involved in drag at that time. Not sure it was really the other way around. I remember late nineties/early 2k's trans community and it was obsessed with stealth and legitimacy through medicalization. There wasn't a lot of ""gender is performance art"" attitude there. The trans people involved in drag was a small subset. Like, those people at the intersection of trans and drag were more influential on drag than on the trans community.

Also, I would definitely not have been a part of the drag scene or the ballroom scene had I been a young adult in the 80's and 90's."

So when a gay person compares the f-word to the n-word, all they are trying to get across is that that word should be as taboo as the n-word, as the n-word being very bad is something that is already well know in the public conscience. It's not meant to be a perfectly identical 1:1 thing, it's meant to get straight people to stop saying it. These parallels are effective.

236,2020-02-02 19:20:43,excd8t,"This doesn’t make ANY sense though. I can’t believe I have to type this sentence but Pee Wee was not a biker himself. Two people of the same gender AND of the same assigned sex dating each other but still being unwelcome at a gay bar translates to “Not only do we not accept your gender identity, but even though we view you as two delusional gay men we still don’t want you here because we don’t like how you present yourselves.”

You get how there’s a difference between “These people are not part of our self defined group so we don’t want them here” and “These people are indisputably part of this group by our own definitions, but they’re weird so we still don’t want them here”, right? 

I understand and agree with your general advice to be pragmatic and aware of where you are welcome and where you are not so that you can make informed decisions, but calling it “their space” is saying that you believe cis gays and lesbians have every right to not only police the gender identities of every person who tries to enter a gay bar, but even if the “identities” are all acceptable to them that they still have the right to exclude people *because of how they look*. Are they asking for everyone’s actual identities before making them feel unwelcome? Are these magical lesbian and gay gatekeepers making absolutely sure that the trans person they’re targeting isn’t just a gender-nonconforming cis person? Unless they asking for everyone’s gender identity before interacting with them, what you are describing can be boiled down to “I do not like how this person looks and I feel entitled to make them uncomfortable because of it. This is acceptable because they look weird.”

And even if an individual doesn’t give a shit about trans folks, I have a hard time imagining that these attitudes wouldn’t catch cis gays in the crossfire. There’s already so much stigma on cis gay men who are too femme and cis lesbians who are too butch. It’s basic respectability politics nonsense. You are not respecting gay/lesbian spaces, you’re conceding them to a small segment of the community."
237,2020-02-02 21:43:07,excd8t,And you didn’t lose credibility when you called a whole cultural art form that you clearly don’t know anything about transphobic?

239,2020-02-05 13:15:58,excd8t,"Where. The fuck. Did. I say. One was worse than the other????

No, it's not ok to respond to bigots in certain ways. Non black people should not be using blackface as a rhetorical device, end of story.

The idea that we should have free rein to respond to bigotry however we want is absurd. What if someone said I looked like a man and I said, ""Hey there are some cis women that look like men! When I first saw /u/ryugi's mom I thought she was a newly transitioning trans woman who needed practice to pass but it turns out she's just cis"".

Does that sound appropriate at all to you? You really think you can say whatever the fuck you want just because you're facing bigotry?"
240,2020-02-02 20:52:28,excd8t,"Pee Wee was a biker, but to them, he was the wrong \*kind\* of biker.  (The whole story is about him trying to find his totally cool red bike, after all).

I don't think that anyone gets that I disagree with the people who are excluding us.  I understand why they feel that way, even if it defies logic.

But its a battle I won't fight.  If the bar/club and its clientele don't want me, I'll go someplace else.

I also agree that judgemental people eat their own.  If I'm in the restroom with 10 other women and the bathroom police come, guess who is getting kicked out? Not me.  Some poor cis woman.  So yeah, newcomers at a place that is eager to weed out undesireables probably do screw up.  Whether that would ever be a wake up call... hmm... would be nice. Maybe sometimes it is.  But me walking into DTM isn't going to change anything for the better."
241,2020-02-03 08:21:40,excd8t,"The first person to bring up race here was *you*. I, meanwhile, have no intention of getting into an argument with you. As it stands, you've already broken rules 2, 3, and 4. Final warning."
242,2020-02-06 06:59:33,excd8t,"By saying that transgender people can't say it's similar to racism, you are saying that transgender people aren't allowed to be offended and that non-transgender people deserve authority over transgender people on the topic of what is or isn't transphobic.

Btw, if you're trying to offend me by mocking my mother then that's just honestly proving how bigotted you are but it's also funny because I hate my mother and really actually want other people to see her for who she really is."
243,2020-02-02 22:30:13,excd8t,"Cool. I'm glad this has been cleared up. You choose not to fight this battle, and that's fine. I suggest you support others who *do* choose to fight this battle though, instead of posting the equivalent of ""Well what did you expect?""."
244,2020-02-03 08:28:31,excd8t,[removed]
245,2020-02-06 14:28:52,excd8t,"\>  you are saying that transgender people aren't allowed to be offended

No, trans people are allowed to be offended

\> non-transgender people deserve authority over transgender people on the topic of what is or isn't transphobic. 

Definitely didn't say this either. Both of those things have nothing to do with the topic at hand

\>  saying that transgender people can't say it's similar to racism 

Now you're putting words in my mouth. Of course trans people are free to point out that transphobia is a form of bigotry, similar to racism. It becomes inappropriate when you try to compare the specific experiences of trans people to the specific experiences of black people, in this case saying that drag is the ""trans version"" of blackface. You don't have the right to draw that equivalency."
246,2020-02-03 08:29:56,excd8t,"Sigh. Suit yourself, then."
247,2020-02-07 06:08:13,excd8t,"Then maybe you need to reevaluate how you communicate because if you meant none of what you said, I genuinely can't imagine what you meant.

I think that black transwomen who say that have every right to. And the non-black transgender people and allies of each have the right to agree with black transwomen who are one of the highest victimized intersectional groups."

275,2020-01-31 10:00:04,ewlrj8,I’m not sure if he’s gay but something is definitely up. I would confront him in a kind of harsh manner I guess. Just straight up. “It’s been over 2 years. We’re married. We should be having sex and atleast WANTING it from each other every so often at the very least. 2 years is an issue for me and I’m sure it has to be for you too in some way. What’s up? Is it medical? Is your sex drive having problem? Are you not attracted to me for any reasons? But we’ve gotta figure this out because I’m at my wits end in an intimateless marriage.” 2 years would be a deal breaker for me. It wouldn’t even get to that point before it would be a deal breaker honestly lol that is a huge issue in a marriage. Something is up.
276,2020-01-31 10:29:49,ewlrj8,"Check out r/deadbedrooms for a community of folks going through the same thing.  Having said that, I fully agree you need to sit him down and let him know what's at stake here.  He's got to work on this with you.  It's not fair to you that he can provide no intimacy.  This will only continue to foster resentment towards him and isn't headed anywhere good.  Can't speak to his sexuality, but it almost doesn't matter, the situation as it stands is untenable.  He owes it to you to be honest about whats going on, and if he isn't sure himself, he owes it to you to try to figure it out.  Good luck to you both!"
277,2020-01-31 12:21:10,ewlrj8,Just curious but did he watch your child coming out of you? I know this may sound weird but I watched my first child being born and it screwed with my head for a good 6 months. I’m not usually squirmish or anything but that was psychologically damaging to me. I’ve talked to other guys who have gone through that as well. He may need to talk to someone if that’s the case.
278,2020-01-31 15:32:19,ewlrj8,"He sounds like he has a Madonna complex (that it's wrong to be attracted to a mother). This isn't going to get better unless he admits the issue and gets therapy, sorry"
279,2020-01-31 19:03:43,ewlrj8,After 3 years it’s pointless looking for reasons except trying to convince yourself that it’s him not you. So just accept that this isn’t your fault and the reasons don’t matter anymore.... now what?
280,2020-01-31 19:47:14,ewlrj8,"I’d let him know it’s time to sit down & be straightforward. And depending on the answer and how happy I was with other aspects of the marriage, I’d let him know the marriage is over, or that as it is companionate marriage and not a sexual one, that I’d be seeking physical intimacy elsewhere."

Cut your losses."
282,2020-01-31 15:58:54,ewlrj8,"No, I had an emergency C-section without anyone other than doctors and nurses in the room.."

284,2020-01-31 16:03:24,ewlrj8,"Well then I haven’t got a clue. Besides, him actually telling you what the issue is, you won’t either. I’d suggest telling him straight up that either he comes clean about what’s going on, or you will have to either find someone who will do his job for him or have to divorce.

Baga and Caitlyn is an odd yet appropriate combo"

Do I like to which party she decided to be affiliated too? No, I don't, I think she did because she has the coin to do it, but I also don't like the witch hunt right wing LGBT people suffer because the community itself decided it is forbidden for them to be."

Problematic or not, republican or not, Caitlyn Jenner is a Trans Icon miles ahead of your fav in the trans icon tier list. She is, to much of the world, synonymous with the term “transgender”. The trans community wanted visibility, little did they know Caitlyn Jenner was gonna deliver it to the world :/"

352,2020-01-29 05:44:02,evf3rv,I find it unlikely that someone could both know that caitlyn Jenner is famous enough to warrant a selfie to post as an example of trans-solidarity but also not know anything about her politics.
353,2020-01-29 13:57:37,evf3rv,"the world is americentric, almost all english language media is american. twitter, instagram, social media, every single english language source of media is completely dominated by american culture. british people know almost everything about american culture. if american people found out that caitlyn jenner liked trump because people on twitter were talking about it, british people saw it too. americans don't know much about other english speaking countries' cultures because they don't have to, because those countries don't dominate media. yours does. so us from those countries see everything you talk about. your celebrities and politics are *everywhere.* we use the same media as you. like, i'm british, i don't even know the words to my own national anthem but i know the words to yours"

361,2020-01-29 08:49:16,evf3rv,"I mean being from the U.K. too, all I knew about Caitlyn was that she was in KUWTK and recently I’m a celeb"

365,2020-01-29 15:12:19,evf3rv,"not saying they dont, they do ! of course they do, we have our own media and own cultures. but it's ignorant to suggest that english people don't know what's happening in american pop culture when americans have a clear monopoly over all western media and social media. british people dont have british twitter, we just have twitter"

367,2020-01-29 09:54:26,evf3rv,How is it racist to point out that you have received homophobic abuse at the hands of somalis?
368,2020-01-29 21:27:13,evf3rv,"How exactly did she know that the men abusing her on the street were Somali and not say, Kenyan? 

Because she has made assumptions about Somalis and reads those assumptions onto the world around her."
369,2020-01-29 12:04:52,evf3rv,"Well, I mean, it's textbook racism, that's how. There’s a very slim chance “all” homophobic remakes she’s experienced have come from a single group of people. And to say being homophobic is part of their culture is to infer ALL Somalis are are homophobic. That is racist."
370,2020-01-29 17:47:28,evf3rv,Because most people who've experienced such abuse just say that it happened.  They don't feel the need to point out (what they believe to be) the nationality of the people who did it.
371,2020-01-29 12:13:33,evf3rv,Of course not all somalis are homophobic but i don't see gay people hopping on a plane to Mogadishu anytime soon.
372,2020-01-29 19:08:12,evf3rv,Strange how if Baga said it was a Polish guy who abused her nobody would have an issue with it.
373,2020-01-29 12:31:32,evf3rv,Ok. Your question makes a lot more sense now. It's hard to see racism when you are also racist. Bye Felicia.
374,2020-01-30 18:37:52,evf3rv,Why are you like this?
375,2020-01-29 12:35:24,evf3rv,"Ah, meaningless accusations of racism. The next best course of action when you have no argument. Cool."
376,2020-01-29 13:34:45,evf3rv,"Ok, here’s a question...how did she know the people she encountered were Somali?"
377,2020-01-29 13:37:08,evf3rv,Somalis are ethnically distinct.
378,2020-01-29 15:01:54,evf3rv,"So when someone is born in Kenya, two minutes over the border, their entire genome and phenotype changes? There's only one race in Somalia and the people there are basically genetic copies of each other? What exactly is your point here?

You're equating someone's heritage with their capacity for homophobia/transphobia and that's why you're racist, James. I'm sorry you dont realise this yourself because one of these days you're going to say some dumb shit to a person of color and you're gonna catch a *shmack*"

389,2020-01-25 23:34:55,etxml9,"Of course they're racist. It is literally built into identity politics. You are not an individual, but rather a representative of the group you belong to. A black person can't be *a guy* but is rather a testimony to blacks as a whole. 

He speaks for the group, he represents the group and therefore, he puts value on the group. 

This kind of logic is inherently racist, because it values the person solely based on their race and nothing else. Not their personal creed, previous achievements or failures. 

This is why **ALL** white people are responsible for **ALL** of the crimes of **ALL** white people. 

And why *ALL* Rich white people bestow privilege onto all whites as a group in turn. 

Their ideology and thought processes are absolutist in nature. There is no nuance. There is no consideration. Black. White. 

They step into the same muddle that the nazis, communists and purists of the past all have stepped into. They sacrifice the individual for the group."

&nbsp;

Rogan isn't beholden to the same corporate money machine like Maddow, Anderson, Cuomo and the rest are.  He isn't relying on Comcast or ATT to write his check.  He has revenue streams from multiple areas and is freer to state his own beliefs.  I think his viewers find him general curious and open minded.  They might not agree with everything he says but like that he is bringing a unique prospective. 

&nbsp;

If Rogans endorsement gives Sanders a big bump, that will mean alternative media has influence.  That influence comes at a cost to Corp media. As people see Corp media less relevant, there will be less viewership, less views = less advertising revenue.

Look at Jon Stewart on Crossfire in 2004, he calls the two hosts ""hacks"" and states
""Right now, you're helping the politicians and corporations and we're left out there""

She's been holding DeShawn Snow hostage in her closet for 9 years?

Full demonic possession by the entity known as *NayNay*?

She choked Kim behind Target again?

She's leaving Gregg for creepy pizza guy John?

She's leaving Gregg for Big Poppa!?"
394,2020-01-22 02:53:11,es5l6m,"I wonder if she has the same 'secret' as Alyssa. That was never revealed to us mere mortals either. 

It's more than likely that Nene's secret is that she is an attention whore and needed just that, attention."

407,2020-01-22 03:25:58,es5l6m,I'm guessing some sort of sexual assault on Nene...considering how upset it made Wendy.

If it was a Caitlen Jenner situation, all involved are expected to be overjoyed at the bravery.  People dismissed Kris Jenner's pain at the situation as intolerance.  I imagine it's pretty traumatic to find out that your husband and father of your children wants to leave you and become a woman."

418,2020-01-22 12:47:40,es5l6m,I could totally see this happening. Greg doesn’t seem like the perfect husband to me. He is a total player old school style.

420,2020-01-22 12:50:20,es5l6m,Hahahaha i would not watch.
421,2020-01-22 12:54:24,es5l6m,Why not? What’s wrong with him wanting to be transgender if he chooses?
422,2020-01-22 03:56:34,es5l6m,"Oh god... that would fit but I really, really hope nothing like that happened. From NeNe being so angry and bottled up the last couple years to making Wendy cry... oy."
423,2020-01-22 12:50:02,es5l6m,Yes i would be hurt too. Kris was expected to be openly cheerful of her transition in the beginning  but what about her life changing in front of the world.
424,2020-01-22 12:55:36,es5l6m,Oh yes she did talk about that. Hopefully it did not turn to physical violence though. But could totally be cause for separation.

I an addition to that, a transgender person does not come out as so because they are trying to emulate a reality tv star. It’s something they’ve struggled with their whole lives and are finally able to live as their true self.

A quick google search on suicide, mental health, and substance abuse in the transgender community could shed a lot of light. It’s not a light hearted issue to be making jokes about."

437,2020-01-20 02:28:05,er6gn0,"Gender and race aren't the same social constructs.  You are your race because you inherited it.  You have your racial designation because your great (sometimes great-great) grandparents were given that racial designation.  Sure, you get your gender from your DNA, which comes from your parents, but you're assigned gender individually.

People are transracial.  There are people who may biologically be a certain race (as much as race can be biological, because it's fake), but are considered and treated as another race.  This is especially prevalent in transracial adoptions."
438,2020-01-20 04:43:01,er6gn0,"In my limited experience,  transgender people generally are not trying to exploit their lived experience for personal gain.  

But, also in MY LIMITED experience, Transracial people seem to only be in it for the perceived benefits, often times playing the victim of racism when they were denied something based on a logical non racial factor.

I have only had life experiences with less than 5 of either group, and I am not a psychologist...  Just an observer."
439,2020-01-20 02:28:02,er6gn0,"I think a lot of people dislike the idea of transracial because it can provoke the ideas and tropes of blackface, and as far as I know, transracial people don't experience race dysphoria the way transgender people experience gender dysphoria. Similar deal to the idea of transspecies, their possible dysphoria isn't really explored (I might be biased since I'm a trans guy, but idk). 

btw, I don't recommend using ""transgender"" as a noun. It sounds a little gross"
440,2020-01-20 02:39:45,er6gn0,"The biggest difference is that there's scientific data to support the idea that someone could be transgender. It's based on how the brain develops in utero and we've known about the  differences in trans people's brains for a while through autopsies and recently brain scans. There's even been experiments using lab rats, exposing them to certain hormones during earlier development. It changed their brain and made them behave more like the opposite sex. Basically, they made transgender rats.

There no such evidence for transracialism. It's not even really comparable. There's no part of the brain that indicates what race you are, because race, for the most part, is entirely a social construct."
441,2020-01-20 03:04:07,er6gn0,there are quite a lot of types of dysphoria which people experience. many of which arent widely known or studied. unfortunately i dont think race is a sexuality which plays a role in lgbtq and what they promote and stand for.
442,2020-01-20 02:33:58,er6gn0,"I wonder this as well

They are essentially the same thing

Neither is physically true, but a fact of feelings and self identity...to respect one, means you should respect both

Equality"
443,2020-01-20 02:37:09,er6gn0,"That's mainly the difference that I see between the two. It's scientifically proven that gender alignment treatment works in alleviating gender dysphoria, but what would the solution be to so-called race dysphoria? Anything I can think of would not only be racist but would probably not make the person feel any different in the same way that hormones can.

In the end, gender as a social construct is mostly dualistic, you're either male or female and the problem arises from people that don't fit neatly into either box. With race however, there's no such duality. Instead there's a recognized variety of races, which are viewed as not being inherently different from each other in the same way that genders are."
444,2020-01-20 04:07:28,er6gn0,"Except it's not the same thing at all, not even essentially. And how is being transgender not ""physically true""?"
445,2020-01-20 05:35:20,er6gn0,"If you are trans, you don't ""feel"" the same as your biological/physical body...ex a man trapped in a woman's body

Would be the same, for trans racial...not feeling and identifying the way you were physically born...as in the ex OP had with the white woman who identifies as black

They are the same because the way you feel inside does not match your DNA...if we, as a society, decide to respect feel over biology (because we as humans have this capacity), then we must respect all circumstances where a person's inside does not match their outside

Equality, MUST be for all, or it is an endless cycle of oppression"
446,2020-01-20 05:40:47,er6gn0,"Gender and race are two entirely different things. Gender is socially constructed whereas race is not. You inherit race. It's in your bones. It's in your lineage.

Gender is not DNA. Sex is DNA. Trans people are not trying to change their sex. I'm trans. We know our DNA will never match our gender, we're not trying to say it will, we don't care lol.

You cannot identify as a unicorn. You cannot identify as an attack helicopter. And not one person is saying you can, and that we should treat attack helicopters as equals."
447,2020-01-20 05:53:46,er6gn0,"So if you want to seperate gender and race, in relation to physical and mental...

If you are born a man.  Your sex is male.  Your DNA is male.  Your bones are male (physically different than female)...but...you dont ""feel"" like a man...so you simply say ""I feel like a female""...how is that any different than replacing each example with race, and respecting them as well?

That woman in the US...born white, white parents, DNA etc...but...grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood.  2 adopted siblings, both black.  Friends, black.  Identifies with black culture.  It feels right.  It feels like her.  Makes herself look black (no one knew she wasn't until her parents outed her).  Fought for black rights (a LEADER in the NAACP)...so much more...

How can she not choose to identify the way she feels as well?"
448,2020-01-20 05:56:40,er6gn0,"To quote u/ BenIncognito from a change my view:

""To start with, trans individuals' brains are different than cisgendered individuals' brains. Men's brains are different than women's brains. And our self-identity is wrapped up a lot into our brains. The same is not true between races. Black brains are not different than white brains, which aren't different than Asian brains.""

When you say she chooses to live her life as an African American, what does this mean? Black people generally may live different lives than others, but that is because if the culture they grew up in, not because their skin is black.

I would say race is more similar to sex. Gender, unlike sex, is a social construct. That's why you can change it. Sex however, is biological. You are either XX or XY. Race is the same type of thing. It's biological. It is based on your lineage and ancestry. It's not an arbitrary societal classification like gender that can be changed. If your parents are Caucasian, you are too. You can't just identify as black because you feel like it, because it will not change the fact that your parents and ancestry are still Caucasian.

Edit: Furthermore, Race dysphoria isn't a thing. Gender dysphoria is. There are no specific neurological differences between specific races that make race dysphoria possible. Gender dysphoria is why transgender people exist. They experience gender dysphoria in which they have the neurological traits and behavioral inclinations of the opposite gender rather than the same gender. This has been medically proven."

463,2020-01-20 02:59:37,er46pp,"My opinion is that a woman named Caitlyn Jenner exists. She is in her seventies. She is an organic life form and is presumably sentient.

She may not be the ""woke""/activist that many would like her to be.  But I honestly think that she is authentic. Maybe part of it is that I have never followed her during her time w/ the Kardashians. I only recall her as the kid named, Bruce at the Olympics, 40 years ago. And I will go so far as to say that I feel a connection w/ her history; From how I felt as a confused kid. Trying to ignore it and make it all work as a Cis male adult. And finally later in life saying, enough. I fully get it, that she has almost as much money as God., And that she is never ever going to have to worry about keeping a roof over her head or getting anything but the very best for medical care. But, at the end of the day, when she is all by herself. She has the same hopes and dreams, and fears, as the rest of us. I wish that folks in our community would find a way to cut her some slack. I feel that unfortunately, it shows the actual limits of acceptance, that you can be Trans in this or that way, and its all cool. But not if you happen to be rich and conservative."

And as far as trans folks resenting her for being looked to as a representative of the trans community; there are a lot of so called representatives of our community that I smh about, but Caitlyn Jenner seems to receive all of the backlash.

487,2020-01-20 09:01:08,er46pp,I’m very familiar with her work with Reed. Kim Kardashian has an unfathomable amount of wealth that she refused and refuses to use to contribute to positivity in the world. Her husband is called slavery a choice and she did nothing. Australia burns and she does nothing. Helping one person and then going on 4000 talk shows about it is cool and all but the fight for criminal justice reform could have started years ago and could be on its way to being solved if she and her family had decided to put their unnecessary wealth toward good instead of flexing luxury cars and multi million dollar homes on Instagram. Rich people like the kardashians can choke.
488,2020-01-20 01:50:15,er46pp,"So if Caitlyn endorsed Bernie and donated a vast amount of her wealth to minorities, would you consider her redeemed?

I certainly hope she campaigns for whever the dem nominee is but time will tell."

“sources familiar with the investigation said there was a number of mitigating factors, including the fact that Jenner wasn't driving recklessly or at excessive speed, didn't flee the scene, traveled with the flow of traffic and wasn't on a cellphone at the time.”


“The Los Angeles County district attorney's office noted that Jenner was traveling slightly below the posted speed limit and ""minimally slower than [the] victim."" To charge Jenner with a crime would require ""ordinary negligence,"" and prosecutors said they ""could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that suspect's conduct was unreasonable.""”

So she wasnt speeding or texting or doing anything particularly irresponsible besides traveling fast for the conditions, which everyone else was also doing.

Sorry, this bothers me A LOT because what happened to her here could have happened to anyone. How often does a low speed differential rear end kill someone???"

With that said, it's hard to blame people for their wealth. I prefer to blame the system that allowed for this economic disparity, and the politicians who allow it to happen(every Dem candidate is a millionaire besides buttigieg). I'm biased though, because I was out protesting for Reed and it was encouraging to see her so active with the case. Reed was a county over from where I live, so it does feel personal. She was there with him when he was supposed to be sentenced to death, without media at all. To me, that's genuine integrity.

As for Australia, [she did donate](https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/a30426725/kim-kardashian-khloe-kardashian-kylie-jenner-criticism-australia-bushire-relief/)  she just didn't announce it. She's damned if she publicizes her donation, she's damned if she doesn't."

Referring to someone by their previous name is generally seen as disrespectful, and is best avoided, especially if it's not relevant to the story.

However....this is an extreme case.  Most normal transgender people aren’t famous and aren’t already in the history books for their accomplishments.   So if your concerned about how to address something as a friend, I’d go with the current gender.   “Mary was a debate team captain back in HS”"

Look at the league; stars of teams can easily demend out of their contracts and they demend who they want to play with next.When at least 3 of your starters want MB it would have been a huge rift to pick against them.That said yeah Divac should have ignored them and got the best guy anyway"

Fact is Vlade bungled the draft, even if he didn't want Luka he could have offered to trade down for assets (see Boston with Fultz/Tatum in 2017)"

Nobody is saying call was right ,gah ppl can be dumb but it definitely had a push from Kings players"
684,2020-03-18 12:21:41,fjnh5r,"God damn ppl are dumb did you even follow news before the draft?Fox and others were welcoming Bagley before he even went to Sacramento to practice it was all on their Instagrams ,twitter..go read them or threads on Kings Reddit. 

When so many starters push for a certain player it can play a part in FO decision ,ofc its still bad call to listen to players"

Yes it is. ...why is this an article? Charities aren’t “non-profits” they are “not for profits,” meaning their main goal is to provide a (usually) money-losing product that relies on donations. They’re still companies that can benefit from endorsements. 

CHURCHES hire people to speak and ask congregations to provide tithes all the time, yet a celebrity interested in accepting a gig to support a charity is bad? I don’t get it."

Very few donations make it to the frontline. The worst offender, in my opinion, is the Royal British Legion who spend 40% of their donates funds to running the National Memorial Arboretum, and that's before the staffers get paid, before the rent and running costs. The level of the donation money that makes it to the people who **need** it is terrible."

If they had tricked them into thinking they legally had to accept this money for some reason, and that they had no choice, then it would be entrapment. The point is that they are left with no reasonable choice but to commit the crime, because of your actions. An example would be ""Steal this car or I'll hurt your family"".

931,2020-03-08 18:42:16,ffb7xr,Is it any shittier then a TV channel charging a charity for commercial time?
932,2020-03-08 16:34:13,ffb7xr,Downplay what? The fact that celebrities are paid spokespeople? Welcome to reality.
933,2020-03-08 16:37:40,ffb7xr,"Taking so much money from a charity for so little work does seem a tad unethical. If you believe in the cause, wouldn't you be donating rather than taking? If you don't believe in the cause, why are you promoting it?

The article is mostly a promo for the upcoming dispatches so we'll see then the overall point this journalists had, but the focus seems more on the charity than the celebrity: 

>“To keep public trust in the charity sector, it is important they are all open and transparent about where their money is going.”

I don't disagree with this either - if I pay £3 a month to a charity that helps African kids and it turns out that mine and 500 other people had their annual contribution go to Caitlyn Jenner for an insta post then they'll feel like their charitable contributions don't go to charity and lose faith in all of them."
934,2020-03-08 16:39:00,ffb7xr,"Yeah I'm also confused.  Why is it unethical for a charity to pay a famous person to endorse them?  Is there some kind of rule that charities must only gain support ""organically?""

Edit: I'm aware that this is a fake charity, but it sounds like the two celebrities were not."
935,2020-03-08 16:38:11,ffb7xr,"Ethics and Morals are of course subject to perspective. When we see celebrities supporting charities we assume (wrongfully or not) that they either believe in the charity and are giving their time and name away free of charge for a good cause, are behind/involved in the charity, or have given to the charity. In many countries tax exempt charities are supposed to disclose where the money goes.

This “sting” shows that the celebrities in question just take thousands to make a post and take a picture with little to no due diligence to what they are backing. Essentially their agencies are like “want to make a quick buck?” The same way in the past as celebrities have endorsed a phone they had never used. “I love this new Samsung product, posted from an iPhone”.

Now you could believe the post accusal backpedaling claiming they only took the money because they knew it was fake or they have never been paid for charity representation up until this one time. But really? This is not solid proof but it opens the discussion and I personally believe if you have been paid to advertise anything you should be required to disclose that fact.

The article makes claims and got 2 famous names to back the claims, both parties now vehemently deny the accusation and it’s now he said/she said."

Did Jenner get away with buckling up that buckaroo because of their transition?  Probably not specifically, because there's no reason to believe a transgender person in an old 96 Toyota Corolla was going to get away with that.

Did it contribute?  In a way, due in part because it was another important step to building Bruce Jenner's profile at the top of his fame at the time.  The fact that Bruce was still more commonly regarded, at the time, than Caitlyn as an identity gave it a ""publicity"" factor that helped.

Yet it's also foolish to assume money wasn't involved, because of course money was involved.

Mind you the only thing I'm arguing against is the idea that we can keep reducing everything into ""X vs. Y"".  The people who say that Jenner's transition was the sole reason the buckaroo didn't get their just deserts is doing the same kind of oversimplification.

That being said, Caitlyn Jenner is a fucking horrible person and should be hated.  Neither fame, nor money, nor transitional status should mitigate how wretched they are."

&#x200B;

 I didn't mention due diligence in my post, sure you aren't responding to the wrong post?

Nevertheless, celebs should look into the charity they are promoting to ensure there isn't a backlash in the future, it's simple business sense. That womens rights charity you have donated to might later run an anti trans rights campaign (for example), and the celebrity is going to be associated with it. If the charity doesn't exist, it shows that they aren't doing due diligence.

&#x200B;

> Especially if they did in fact donate the money made to another charity.

That shouldn't change anything. Jenner is saying that was her 'original intention' anyway, which is up to you if you believe or not, Redknapp is clearly only donating the money as he's been caught out and looking for goodwill."

No, charities are not for profit. That's why they are called non-profits. Do you even understand what the word profit means?

>Secondly, spending a little money on celebrity sponsors is good business sense if that sponsorship yields a greater return on the organizations initial investment which is why some charities are willing to pay those monies.

You're completely missing the point. The problematic party here is not the charities which are not even real charities. The problem is the multimillionaire celebrities taking 20k in charity money and then acting like they are doing it for charity. It's unethical. 

>""Celebrity endorsements work and are nothing new. Live aid, comic relief, political campaigns, etc. The lost goes on and on. Sometimes those celebrities are paid and sometimes the celebrity donates their services. It's up to the person and the organization to determine if and how the endorsement will take place.""

I'd like you to provide evidence that any celebrities who did something for live aid or comic relief were paid for their time. Because despite you insisting that this is normal, IT'S NOT. Celebrities donate their time to charities. That's how it fucking works. That's why when celebrities go on game shows their prize money gets donated as well. The obvious notion being that they are already rich as fuck so it's completely unethical for them to take money that is supposed to be going to needy people."

1094,2020-03-08 20:04:20,ffb7xr,"Not for profit vs for profit is purely a tax distinction and has nothing to do with actual revenue stream. My point is simply that nonprofit entities HAVE to make money to be able to affect the change they seek. Profits  are meant to be used for the primary mission of the organization (though there are too many instances where even nonprofit charities are shown to actually be for profit anyway despite what they claim).

I've already provided evidence of celebrities being paid to promote charities in the link embedded in my previous comment.  I was speaking about live aid and comic relief separately to show how successful celebrity endorsements could be for charities. I have no idea if those comics or bands were paid for their performances or not. Nor do I care to look it up because it's completely unrelated to the point I was making at the time."
1095,2020-03-08 20:34:19,ffb7xr,"> If they didnt get paid then they wouldnt do anything. 

You know regular people who aren't multi millionaires donate their time all the time right? They are called volunteers. 

>Look celebrity time cost money.

It doesn't cost money if they donate their time which is what they are SUPPOSED TO DO WHEN DOING CHARITY WORK. 

Harry Redknapp has a net worth of 18 million dollars. Caitlyn Jenner has a net worth of ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. The fact that you are standing here, saying they NEED to demand 20 grand from charities because ""their time is worth money"" is beyond pathetic. Get some fucking class awareness. These celebrities worth 100 million dollars are charging 20 grand to tell working class people like YOU to donate your own hard earned money, while pretending they are doing it for charity."

Yeah because they are worth 100 mill means they have a lot more influence then me. How about coming back to reality.

Yeah and what if they don't, which they won't, because why would they? If they wanted to donate it to charity they would just have done the job for free in the first place. Do you expect me to buy that? Do you even seriously buy that yourself? You can't be serious. 

> They are doong it for charity, that 20k endorsement might bring in 120k worth of donations. The boom, they did do it for free because they just made the charity 100k.

Or they could do the endorsement for free and make the charity 120k instead of 100k. You know considering they already have more money than most of us will ever make in our entire lifetimes x 1000. 

But anyways that's about as far as we can take this. You're clearly not a very bright person and this is a waste of time."

1102,2020-03-08 20:45:18,ffb7xr,"Ok then, let's look at the UK.

Shouldn't those employees be expected to work for free as well then since it's in support of the charity? 

>The median salary for the 100 highest paid charity positions is £165k per annum.

Why should the leadership expect celebrities to work for free when they don't themselves? Nevermind the question of how taking a 165k salary annually from the charity for one person equals nonprofit. The charity itself may not be making profit but the people running it certainly are.

They offered there services at a reduced rate because it was for charity. Its like, we have a consultant that we use, they are a huge successful  company. They offer some services not for free, but reduced rate. But they still charge. They could be getting a 100k serivice for only 20k."
1106,2020-03-08 21:05:35,ffb7xr,Both of your arguments are based off the assumption that a celebrity's time isn't worth as much as a normal person's therefore shouldn't be paid for their work. That's just stupid.

1108,2020-03-08 22:14:09,ffb7xr,It's not about how fucking valuable their time is. Its about ethics. It you're worth 100 mil you shouldn't be taking money from charity period. Not hard to understand.

1114,2020-03-08 23:06:07,ffb7xr,"What is morally bankrupt about being paid for your work? If the person isn't personally or emotionally invested in the charity, and the charity wants that person to help them make some money then what is immoral or unethical about the person accepting payment for the value they bring? That's no more or less less ethical than the normal people working for the  charity getting paid for their efforts."
1115,2020-03-08 23:20:01,ffb7xr,"Like I said, it's sort of like trying to teach a dog to play chess. You apparently just don't have the fundamental wiring going on upstairs to understand why it's unethical for a multimillionaire to accept charity money in order to tell poor people to donate money to charity. Not surprising, Americans are taught since birth that greed is good and fucking over your fellow man for a paycheque just makes you a good capitalist."

>it's unethical for a multimillionaire to accept charity money

Again, they're being paid for their time, effort and influence. That's not unethical. Your suggestion that they should work for free becasue they're somehow worth less than other people working for the charity is the real lack of ethics here. 

>in order to tell poor people to donate money to charity.

They're not telling anyone to do anything. They're asking people who can afford to do so to donate to whatever cause they're promoting. 

You seem to be bent out of shape over the fact that celebrities are making money by promoting something that's fundamentally no different than any other promotional work they do. Someone pays them, they show up and read the script. It's just a job like any other."
1117,2020-03-08 10:30:08,ffaecq,"Wait, is it illegal to get paid by charities? Or just creepy? This seems like nothing.

Edit: This is basically promotion for an upcoming TV show about this topic. The host says: “To keep public trust in the charity sector, it is important they are all open and transparent about where their money is going.” Sure, so investigate inaccurate reporting by charities of their finances, or inadequate reporting requirements. The fact that a celebrity got paid to do a photo shoot and send a tweet has nothing to do with the charity’s transparency."

For the final, 29th day of February, I challenged myself to practice brevity and write short, two sentence plugs for 28 more albums:

Album/Artist  |  Length/Genre  |  My Pitch | Sample Track
-------------|----------|-------------|----
***Burn Pygmalion!!! a Better Guide to Romance*** by **The Scary Jokes**  |  50 Mins / Bedroom Pop  |  This is ridiculously saccharine, queer, and full of hooks and one liners. While long and a bit unfocused, it’s very easy to listen to and I notice something new each time. | [""Community Gardens""](https://youtu.be/-XZWJ9_vrHo)
***Essentials*** by **Erika de Casier**  |  45 Mins / R&B  |  Scintillating r&b that stands out thanks to the breezy, flirty nature. I love her voice and the songs are stealthily catchy and really fun to listen to. | [""Do My Thing""](https://youtu.be/rEmRS_mr9yk)
***Maybe I’ll Find You Again*** by **Ruth B.**  |  18 Mins / Pop  |  One hit wonder Ruth B. continues to release thoughtful, piano driven pop dripping in a blend of melancholy and hope. The trendy production on these tracks gives the songs a spark makes them some of her most addictive yet. | [""Rare""](https://youtu.be/jfch4b9hWic)
***Nusrat On The Beach*** by **Humeysha**  |  10 Mins / Electronic  |  A tight three song EP that fuses traditional Indian music with electronic music, with Humeysha’s buttery vocals at the core. The loose, dreamy soundscapes are worth at least one listen. | [""Nusrat On The Beach""](https://youtu.be/MQVPztSdjNw)
***Nicole Kidman / Anne Hathaway*** by **Hana Vu**  |  28 Mins / Alt-Pop  |  This is an intelligent, introspective album, but she still knows how to turn the party when she needs to! She seems to hop genres with every song, tying together rock, r&b, disco, and more with a DIY touch and a wailing voice. | [""Actress""](https://youtu.be/u77mMmsacns)
***Bird On The Wing*** by **Shy Girls**  |  37 Mins / R&B  |  Groovy r&b with tender lyrics and instrumentation that’s gentle without feeling sluggish. There are so many beautiful “healing” moments on this album. | [""Lay & Be Lonely""](https://youtu.be/6umNEb9mTXk)
***Vagina*** by **Alaska Thunderfuck 500**  |  42 Mins / Comedy + Dance  |  While the album is replete with memes and in-jokes for her RPDR fandom, Alaska isn’t afraid to make a point when she feels like it, and the sizzling club-ready production on this album is no joke either. This goes harder than most dance pop released last year. | [""Vagina""](https://youtu.be/jTKJ1TSlJlQ)
***the masquerade*** by **mxmtoon**  |  33 Mins / Indie  |  The rising indie star once again works her way into our hearts with charming tunes and relatable lyrics. Interestingly it’s a “double album,” offering both pop and acoustic flips on each song.  | [""Prom Dress""](https://youtu.be/AeUeLzBO0go)
***Carole and Tuesday OST* Volumes I & II**  |  58 + 73 Mins / Pop  |  Netflix’s new anime *Carole and Tuesday* is an adorable ode to the power of music with a surprisingly poptimist sensibility that imagines what the pop stars of the future will be like. This diverse cast results in a soundtrack that explores pop from a variety of angles and styles, with consistently high quality throughout. | [""Move Mountains""](https://youtu.be/GUt3UboSUd4)
***Hey*** by **Kendall :3**  |  39 Mins / Bedroom Pop  |  This is a very sweet little album that’s simple and obviously DIY, but that’s just part of the appeal! The crazier pop moments contrast nicely with the softer moments and you can really hear the human underneath it all. | [""String Lights""](https://youtu.be/K9XFdpaXb5Q)
***Kikuo Miku 6*** by **Kikuo**  |  47 Minutes / Electronic  |   A slightly terrifying album of hard electronic beats and discordant Vocaloid music that feels like the soundtrack to a video game set in a haunted carnival. Listen with headphones because the production is intricately layered. | [""Hole Dwelling""](https://youtu.be/I15sK7dNMOM)
***Dynasty*** by **Hua Li**  |  47 Mins / Rap + R&B  |  The almost sleepy r&b portions contrast nicely with the harder rap sections to create a very cool, modern sounding album. Hua Lipa pours her thoughts on the world out in both Chinese and English, with strong “girl power” messages abound. | [""Mr. Greenlight""](https://youtu.be/XPM81M7PGyA)
***Lost Girls* by** **Bat For Lashes**  |  38 Mins / Synthpop  |  Thrumming slow disco, this album has a distinctive “late night at the jazz club” vibe. Please listen to it while wearing all black and leaning on a bar stool. | [""Kids In The Dark""](https://youtu.be/qm3Xg289qTM)
***Fishing Queen*** by **Fishingirls**  |  40 Mins / Pop-Rock  |  A Korean band (as in, they play instruments), the blend of the singers’ girlish vocals and the rocking instrumentation is perfect for the pop-rock style. It’s kinda nostalgic in that way, but still feels fresh. | [""응 니얼굴""](https://youtu.be/jQIYoUwXiWw?t=36)
***Dream Girl*** by **Anna of the North** |  41 Mins / Electropop  |  Really cute electropop with some soul influences, the colorful synth palate and Anna’s girlish vocals give this a sweet, dreamy vibe. It’s an uplifting collection of songs, she may look sweet but there’s some muscle behind this music. | [""Thank Me Later""](https://youtu.be/83nYuUfIpfE)
***Sketchbook*** by **Fantasia**  |  44 Mins / R&B  |  The American Idol winner returns with her first independent album, to mixed effect. She toys around with a lot of different kinds of r&b and while your mileage may vary from track to track her unique powerhouse voice is as fine as ever and when she gets it right, she nails it. | [""Enough""](https://youtu.be/THdJDnoYp6Q)
***Oh Uncertainty! A Universe Despairs*** by **Blood Cultures**  |  38 Mins / Indie  |  This indie album is a little freaky, and that’s a good thing! There are borderline scare chords on this album as heavy bass and droning guitars spice up these autumnal songs that range from indie rock to distorted dance pop. | [""Dunk On Me""](https://youtu.be/l3usBOwkkt8)
***Ardis*** by **Ziemba**  |  42 Mins / Alt-Pop  |  Ziemba aims to conjure up a different world on this ambitious, almost baroque alt-pop album, and it’s a strange one. These songs are ornate, lyrically weird, and always a bit much, but all in a very deliberate artistic way that makes this a compelling listen. | [""Lips 2 Lips""](https://youtu.be/9IHTu-VJEZA)
***The Nine*** by **Sam Barsh**  |  45 Mins / Hip-Hop  |  An album paying tribute to Ruth Bader Ginsberg, of all things, but it’s also an examination of racism and the police state in America. Slick hip-hop and rap with an impressive list of features, these songs are melodic but still hit hard. | [""Truth (feat. Aloe Blacc)""](https://youtu.be/N-F64uXTgCA)
***Unapologetically*** by **Monét X Change**  |  10 Mins / House Pop  |  Monét makes a surprisingly good house diva, bringing the attitude and vocals needed to make these songs memorable. Actually the songs are very well written too, this is one of the best releases we’ve had from a Drag Race girl in years. | [""There For You""](https://youtu.be/8L6eqgsJ_DE)
***Adventures of the FRNDship: Issue One*** by **FRND**  |  10 Mins / EDM  |  While he makes fairly straightforward EDM, FRND distinguishes himself by bringing a sense of adventure to his music to tie in with his cartoon alter ego. The bombastic production, chaotic drops, and dramatic vocals make his songs feel very epic and addictive. | [""Graveyard""](https://youtu.be/C9L2s-1grmc)
***Moon*** by **Diana Wang**  |  25 Mins / Alt-R&B  |  Gentle alt-r&b, even though most of the album is Chinese the intelligence in the writing shines through. This is a subtle kind of album, but the songs are gorgeous. | [""Hello, I said""](https://youtu.be/-LyCbzSEs-4)
***City Pop*** by **Benny Sings**  |  34 Mins / Pop   |  Sunny, feel good pop with bouncy melodies and crisp vocals. It’s a little basic (one of the songs was literally written for a beer commercial) but if you surrender to it there’s some really positive vibes here. | [""Everything I Know""](https://youtu.be/Ss0s60aoK6M)
***Juramento Mantarraya*** by **Aries**  |  27 Mins Electropop  |  This is a cute little electropop album that always comes out of left field with some really quirky production to supplement the catchy melodies. There’s an air of bright optimism to it all with Aries’s sweet voice guiding us through her vision of the Spanish towns she lives in. | [""Juramento Mantarraya""](https://youtu.be/4yvqtxqNPoE)
***Dyslexic Lemons*** by **Gooseworx**  |  39 Mins / Quirky   |  Online animator Gooseworx brings a certain crazy energy to all of their art, and their music is no exception. This is a purely instrumental album, but the cartoony dance songs will keep you grooving regardless. | [""Sassy Brass""](https://youtu.be/z8zOymwDOPA)
***Generasian*** by **Lim Kim**  |  21 Mins / Alt-Rap  |  She breaks all the rules with this album, fusing together Korean folk, industrial hip-hop, rap, and art pop into an in-your-face exploration of what it means to be Asian. While possibly too artsy for its own good, it’s a bold and fascinating listen. | [""Yellow""](https://youtu.be/o5S3sPpkd8w)
***Bussin’*** by **Devin Morrisson**  |  42 Mins / R&B  |  Devin Morrisson’s uses his silky voice and some amazing featured artists to propel these ’90s r&b throwbacks to greatness. This is good old fashioned bedroom music. | [""The Call (407) (feat. We Are King)""](https://youtu.be/TnKwZI5Q0XQ?t=878)
***Glorious*** by **Ella Henderson**  |  12 Mins / Pop  |  While she didn’t return with the huge maximalist pop songs I’d hoped for, these more low-key trap/piano songs are still a great showcase of Ella Henderson’s talents. Each song on here is anthemic in its own way and really grows on you. | [""Friends""](https://youtu.be/EdwTmn8hTm4)

Thank you for the tunes on this Monday afternoon!"

I'm gonna give Faye Webster a spin today! I'm intrigued, and  Amara La Negra too if i have time."
1148,2020-03-02 23:23:56,fcfsom,Thank you so much for putting this together. I second the recommendation of Sir Babygirl's *Crush on Me*.
1149,2020-03-03 14:27:13,fcfsom,"Wow, thanks for this post! I liked *Blood* and *Dream Girl* myself.

If may, I would like to make a plug for a 2019 album myself: 

[**Hanadriel by HANA**](https://open.spotify.com/album/4BlLJn9RjIJ9WufqeufTCU) **(Electropop)**

* **For fans of:** Grimes, Allie X, Purity Ring, ""ethereal"" vocals, *The Lord of the Rings*, the colour purple, video games

**Description:** This was my most listened-to album of last year and made me into a Hana fan. It's a really pretty, fun, emotional, upbeat electropop album which got her some media attention for livestreaming the making of it over the course of only four weeks. Imagine Grimes but less robots and more elves, and instead of black and red it's purple and pink. That's Hana, and she is such a good songwriter and has such a beautiful voice. I love this album so much! Her 2016 EP is very good too, and I think this album is even better.

**Positives:** Catchy melodies; very atmospheric and cohesive; 100% written, produced, and performed by her for those are into singer-songwriters

**Potential barriers:** A bit on the long side (over 50 minutes) with some long (5-6 minute) tracks; might not be for those who don't like ""artsy"" pop
> Sample track: [""Anxious Alien""](https://open.spotify.com/track/0TTpGPHbDIPCM79MXXUZAZ), though a bit more alt-rock influenced than most of the songs on the album, is a fun, upbeat track with ironic lyrics about self-esteem issues. This album's lyrics have a way of making you think ""wow, mood""."
1150,2020-03-02 18:23:42,fcfsom,If you think I missed most of those then HA! You're absolutely right I did
1151,2020-03-02 18:41:35,fcfsom,I absolutely loved Was it even real. It’s really an album when you’re just over life and need to step away for a bit
1152,2020-03-02 20:22:36,fcfsom,"Here for Tank and the Bangas.  Also, I’m gonna check out some of these records, thank you!!"
1153,2020-03-02 20:36:34,fcfsom,"Wow, what a great post. This is so impressive. 

I'm listening to UDD and this is definitely something I never ever would have come across without posts like this, but it's a good vibe. Thank you for the recommendations."
1154,2020-03-02 23:42:28,fcfsom,"i stan the KAINA love <3

one I would include is MASTER by Mariah the Scientist. I was surprised I liked this album, but it tells the story of Mariah the Scientist overcoming self doubts and a toxic relationship in a very R&B/pop way. She reminded me a lot of Jhene Aiko but not as psychedelic. Other comparisons could be SZA, who I absolutely ADORE. Anyway, the album is really great, and it has some bangers. The opener ""Note to Self"" is all about airing your dirty laundry with yourself, and you'll love the song even more when you figure out the word she's spelling out if you're anything like me. Two other tracks that stood out to me were ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Not a Love Song"". ""Beetlejuice"" is a straight up banger that depicts the murky waters of a toxic, complicated relationship, and ""Not A Love Song"" is my personal favorite from the album. It closes the album with Mariah reminiscing on herself, her ex, their relationship, and what her momma said about him just to name some things, and it's been one of my favorite songs recently. It might not be everyone's cup of tea if you don't love breakup/sadder/insecure music, but Mariah sells it, singing with confidence even as she talks about her pitfalls. Some might find it a little simplistic too, but I think it's definitely a very good album that almost no one is talking about."
1155,2020-03-03 00:03:36,fcfsom,"Incredibly high quality post. Thank you for all your efforts, they are truly appreciated. I just added a few of these to my playlist and I am really looking forward to discovering them!"
1156,2020-03-03 02:55:45,fcfsom,"I just find out about rakky ripper about some days ago, And I’m obsessed with her album, I’m glad someone notice her too"
1157,2020-03-03 07:00:37,fcfsom,"Rakky Ripper's Neptune Diamond was one of my favorite releases last year. Also the inclusion of Faye Webster, sir babygirl & bree runway is pure taste. I will read this well in a bit and listen to some of these, thank you!"
1158,2020-03-03 09:24:35,fcfsom,frankie makes cute pop music!!!!!!! her ep dreamstate is also really good! (new obsession is a full on BOP)
1159,2020-03-03 13:59:01,fcfsom,Even in the Tremor by Lady Lamb is really cute. Deep Love cured my depression!
1160,2020-03-04 14:06:31,fcfsom,"Finally had time to listen through! Thanks for the amazing, informative write-up. <3 Rakky Ripper is so GOOD, omg. I can't believe I missed out on her and Lim Kim in 2019."
1161,2020-03-22 10:53:49,fcfsom,Thank you for introducing me to Lo Lo! Convenient is a masterpiece.

1164,2020-03-02 18:53:31,fcfsom,"I love Bat For Lashes latest album! I was then trying to listen to the rest of her discography but it just wasn't for me.

You make me go and finally give Anna of the North a listen, I've seen her name being suggested to me so many times so it's now inevitable."
1165,2020-03-02 19:19:01,fcfsom,Thank you! Excited to check out some of the bedroom pop albums.
1166,2020-03-02 18:16:52,fcfsom,Actually I’m just unemployed so I have a lot of time on my hands
1167,2020-03-02 19:44:09,fcfsom,People need to get on board with her so she can release more music!
1168,2020-03-04 20:14:44,fcfsom,is she PC affiliated? I haven't found much info about her but X2C sounds like a SOPHIE prod. track
1169,2020-03-03 13:57:55,fcfsom,YES. Due West makes me wanna run away to California and foreign car does something to me that I don’t quite yet understand
1170,2020-03-03 01:47:52,fcfsom,"It helps when you have nothing else to do, but also I listened to most of these over the course of last year so it wasn't too much to just revisit some of them."

1173,2020-03-03 01:47:10,fcfsom,"FINALLY another KAINA fan, everything she's dropped is so good!

*MASTER* was really good too, ""Beetlejuice"" is always getting stuck in my head."
1174,2020-03-03 01:46:07,fcfsom,Which ones 👀
1175,2020-03-02 19:42:10,fcfsom,"She's the epitome of the ""villain who makes artificial pop songs that are unironically better than the protagonist's"" trope."
1176,2020-03-03 00:05:34,fcfsom,"The first notes of 'Hold Me Now' were love at first sight (listen!) and I genuinely cried during 'Mother'. What an incredible, yet underrated show!"
1177,2020-03-02 19:41:16,fcfsom,"I've been listening to a lot of bedroom pop these past few days, it's fun!"
1178,2020-03-03 12:49:14,fcfsom,"I wish you get a job soon! Good luck with that!

You should honestly consider writing books or something though. Your research skills seem really good!"
1179,2020-03-04 20:21:22,fcfsom,"Don’t quote me on this, but I think that her music is just PC Music-inspired. I could be wrong though, I rarely look at producer credits lol."
1180,2020-03-02 19:47:14,fcfsom,I kinda stopped listening to her after it’s not that deep and then stumbled on her again recently. I totally forgot about her but she is relatable. Don’t really listen to a lot of her songs but she is someone that I definitely need to look into more.
1181,2020-03-03 07:31:22,fcfsom,"For now, Crush on Me - Sir Babygirl and Sweater Collection - Lo Lo. These were the two whose description fit my tastes the most 😊"
1182,2020-03-05 05:36:44,fcfsom,ah ok i just heard pots and pans and jumped to Sophie
1183,2020-03-03 07:38:26,fcfsom,"That's taste, that checks out. If I could offer more unsolicited advice, *STA7GES* by FRANKIE is also exactly in the vein as those two."
1184,2020-03-03 07:46:27,fcfsom,"I downloaded it without even listening to a song, I totally trust you when you say it's right up my alley!

I often feel among my friends like a music encyclopedia and get way too intense about albums, but you seem to be on a whole other level. How does it feel to be such an expert? 😎"
1185,2020-03-03 07:47:55,fcfsom,"I don’t actually know that much, I just talk more than everyone else so it seems like I do!"
1186,2020-03-03 07:49:19,fcfsom,"Yeah, I think you underestimate yourself a bit on this, but thanks anyway for the sweet recommendations!"
1187,2020-03-01 21:05:18,fc0agy,I cannot emphasize enough how much I hate her. I hate that she's this poster women for all trans people. She's a piece of shit and I don't trust anyone who likes her tbh

I'm not the same as any other trans person because we have the same medical condition. I do get treated like I need protection, but I'm also 16 and hanging out with adults a lot because of my hobbies (not sexual, just typically not something people my age like)."

Sure, internalised homophobia is a widespread issue in the gay community, but where did the internalised homophobia come from? A bunch of gay people just randomly started despising themselves, apropos of nothing? 

And it makes even less sense when talking about the Middle East and North Africa. Gay people campaigned for homosexuality to be made illegal? Gay people are the secret police officers who abduct and torture gay people? The people guarding prison cells where gay people are held captive are themselves gay? In Iran, when executioners hang gay people, or in Saudi Arabia when they behead them, or in Afghanistan when they stone them, those executioners are all gay? When an extended family gets together to murder a young relative they suspect is gay, that entire family is gay?"

With that being said, wtf is the point in misgendering this woman? She is a woman, she is behaving like an asshole. Both things can be true."

1274,2020-04-21 04:23:28,g4r8i7,"Exactly. There’s someone I know of in my local community who is trans and also a paedophile and general creep. Do we misgender them when we talk about them, or say their being trans is the “cause” for their paedophilia? Hell no. That’s just common sense."
1275,2020-04-18 00:16:51,g3ah09,"Just tell her you only see her like a sister to you,  it's okay to only think of her as a friend."
1276,2020-04-18 02:36:26,g3ah09,"Just because she transitioned that doesn’t change your previous relationship with her.   The majority of your history (from your perspective) is two guys who are best friends.   

This real relationship, a major part of your life, doesn’t get erased because she transitioned and it is pretty crazy that she expects you to do a mind wipe.

She has had years to process this, and she gave you zero warning before a video phone call.  There isn’t a whole lot of empathy about what your are experiencing.

You sound like you have been considerate and supportive, but if I was in the same situation a relationship would be completely off of the table.   Don’t feel any guilt about that."
1277,2020-04-17 21:45:21,g3ah09,"“Hey, you’re a really important person to me, and your transition didn’t change that. I’m here and ready to talk when you are, but I understand if you need some space after our last conversation. Hit me up when you’re ready, hope you’re staying safe and healthy in the meantime.” 

She’s going through a lot right now, and I think that merits an unusual amount of patience. I suspect that on some level that she saw winning your sexual/romantic interest as the ultimate validation of her femininity - you’ve always been a safe, comfortable person for her and it makes sense that you’re the one she’d turn to for this. It may also be tangled up in some iffy beliefs about men always being down to fuck any willing woman, and if you didn’t want to fuck *her* it must be because you still see her as a man. Rejecting her romantically likely felt like a rejection of her identity as a whole, and it’s no surprise that she reacted the way she did. 

This doesn’t mean you’ve done anything wrong or that you’ve failed to properly accept her transition. It was an unfair expectation that she may not even be fully aware she had until the moment to act on it arrived. She’s still got a long journey ahead of her and that’s going to involve a lot of unpacking regarding her gender hangups and self-esteem issues. She’ll chill out in time, and I hope your friendship survives the process."
1278,2020-04-17 22:28:45,g3ah09,"I don't think she's in love with you, I think she's confused. She was expecting a worse reaction from you and you handled it amazingly. This could have made her feel good and safe and the alcohol probably took over and made her think that because now she is a female, she could create a sexual relationship with you. It happens sometimes with male and female relationships, you know? Someone gets comfortable and slips up for a second. I think you should reach out to her, tell her it's okay what happened. Tell her you love her as a sister and that she's your bestfriend and you're there for her and want to continue your bestfriendship. Tell her you can't see her that way because she's family to you, not because of how she looks or how she is."
1279,2020-04-18 15:11:38,g3ah09,"I'm a bisexual woman and totally understand what you mean about childhood friends. I've been friends with a girl since we were 5 and I could never do anything sexual with her. It's just too weird. 

Your friend is honestly being kind of pushy. 'No' is a full sentence. To drop something that big on you after years and then kiss you with no warning is not okay. To cry and scream and storm off because somebody doesn't want to kiss you isn't okay. You haven't been involved with her before and there's no reason she should assume just because she's attractive now you will be with her in that way. I get she has her own life stuff going on but regardless of what she's going through this behavior is just not acceptable. I'm surprised she didn't reach out to you with an apology after sobering up. 

You can reach out and let her know you are not interested in her as anymore than friends. You don't have to give reasons. That is a good enough reason. I feel like how she reacts will tell you whether this friendship is salvagable. For me personally if a friend continued to be pushy after I showed no interest, I wouldn't hang out with that friend anymore."
1280,2020-04-17 21:38:38,g3ah09,"You’re a really good friend most people wouldn’t of handled it the way you did. Transgender women face a lot of issues not just psychologically (feeling unattractive) but also violence. Don’t cut off contact but reassure her that you are her friend and if you can not see her more then just your best friend Jessica, let her know. Let her know you’ll always be there but only if you want to maintain this friendship"
1281,2020-04-18 02:07:31,g3ah09,"Alcohol or no, there’s no excuse for kissing you out of nowhere. She needs to apologize for that first. She also owes you an apology for making you feel guilty for rejecting her. She acted completely inappropriately, and it’s never acceptable to make someone feel bad for rejecting a sexual advance. That’s basic consent.

As for her feelings, you have no obligation to be sexually/romantically attracted to her. I don’t think it would be helpful to say things like “actually I think you’re pretty but I can’t because of our history.” That would just be confusing to her. Just make a clear boundary- you want to support her and continue the friendship but you are not interested in anything romantic or sexual. She tried to completely redefine your friendship unilaterally and that’s not fair to you.

If she can respect that, then you go forward and figure out what the friendship is going to look like now. 

If she can’t respect that- then there’s not much hope for the friendship. It’s possible her feelings are just confusion and that she’ll resolve them over time. But if she is going to keep trying to pursue you or make you feel guilty for reciprocating, then you can’t really maintain that friendship."
1282,2020-04-18 01:54:42,g3ah09,"point out to her you see her as a sister, I wouldn't wanna kiss my bestie whose like a brother to me because yikes almighty would that feel incestuous. she surprised you when drunk and took a liberty she did not have permission to take, she should apologize for the kiss."
1283,2020-04-17 21:12:51,g3ah09,"I think you did a great job. She shouldn't have kissed you. I'm sorry that she did. You can talk to her and tell her that you support her and want to be friends with her, but you don't see a romantic future with her. I don't think you should go on a road trip with her and, in all honesty, you probably should talk to her less so she can get over her crush on you."
1284,2020-04-18 12:41:10,g3ah09,"You don’t owe sexual or romantic attraction to anyone. Period. Especially someone you’ve known for so long and have seen go through so much. 

It’s likely she’s in immense pain and is confused, but she loves you as her best friend. She’s confusing those feelings for romantic ones because she probably hasn’t been successful in dating and really needs a supportive therapist to work through her own internal issues. 

All of this to say - you’re being a great friend and what she did to you was wrong. You do not owe her a relationship even if she is physically attractive to you. 

I would set very clear boundaries and maybe talk to her about what you are willing to do to help - suggest therapy or a support group, offer to find her supportive groups of other trans people to be able to understand what she’s going through. 

She’s experienced some trauma but that’s no excuse to a) not tell you before face timing you and b) kiss you without your consent or try to coerce you into being intimate with her. 

You’re an excellent person, OP."
1285,2020-04-17 21:27:13,g3ah09,"Her being a woman and/or transgender will tend to make people be much gentler on her than they'd normally be. If a dude had just kissed a lifelong platonic friend who'd literally referred to him as a sibling, half the replies would be calling him predatory or a slimy ""nice guy"". 

Your friend may be confused about how old relationships will go forward after her transition, and she may feel insecure about her looks, but that doesn't remove her responsibility to act like a decent human being. She shouldn't be kissing people who've given her no indication of sexual interest, and she certainly shouldn't be getting whiny and huffy if said people continue showing no sexual interest in her. Ok fine, she was a bit drunk - she should've reached out to you with apologies after sobering up."
1286,2020-04-18 12:54:24,g3ah09,"As a trans person, I was scared to read this post and the comments. But once again, reddit comes through for me.

I am really glad to hear that you are being such a supportive friend. I would recommend reaching out and letting her know that you're still siblings but that is how you view her.

Based on her reaction and and prior homophobia, there is a slight possibility that she has been crushing on you for awhile.  For some trans folks, we can tell somethings off but it's not clear if it's a gender or sexuality thing (or both!). I say this because the narratives around trans coming outs are pretty polarized and usually end in violence or romance. You driving to her and comforting her was obviously not violent so it might have created a fantasy of the two of you. 

The reason why I'm saying this because she might need continued support and if she gets it from you, she mighy put you on a pedestal. You sound like a really good guy but please don't feed into any potential ""saviour"" tropes and let her know that there are many people out there who would find her beautiful and be honoured to get to know her.

Edit: not justifying her kissing you after you said no. I am providing some context that I think might be happening so you can better move forward."
1287,2020-04-18 12:08:15,g3ah09,In all that I’m feeling most proud that you didn’t drink and drive.
1288,2020-04-18 13:19:13,g3ah09,"She was drunk and it was a high-emotion situation, call her, she’s probably embarrassed and doesn’t want to call you. Just say what you said here, that you love her but you don’t see her that way."
1289,2020-04-18 13:37:18,g3ah09,"She's going through some stuff right now. Give her some space, but don't disappear. Tell her that you are still her friend, you still support her, but that you are just friends.

You've handled this amazingly, considering, so be proud of that and keep supporting your friend. Hopefully you can be a steadying and supporting force in her life that's been nothing but chaos and uncertainty for the last few years."
1290,2020-04-17 21:10:53,g3ah09,"I would guess it was probably the alcohol, mostly.  However, it could be a standard case of ""I just found out my friend likes me as more than a friend"", in which case you just try and be as kind as possible.  If you find out you like your friend back then that's great, and if not then you just be honest and hopefully you can stay friends.  Since you haven't seen each other in so long, maybe it will be easy to go back to playing x box together.

I do want to repeat that this was all under the influence of alcohol.  Sometimes drinking makes people behave in ways they wouldn't normally."
1291,2020-04-18 15:29:46,g3ah09,">A couple hours later, while we were both pretty drunk on the couch when she suddenly kissed me.

This is a huge red flag. Please do not blame yourself for their emotions, none of this is your fault.

Your friend is clearly an emotionally abused gay man and has been completely betrayed by A system that should have helped him."

1295,2020-04-18 02:26:45,g3ah09,"I think you've handled this pretty so far. The fact that this all happened over ONE DAY is something neither of you can overlook. That she's trans, got kicked out of her home, finds you attractive, hasn't seen you face-to-face in years, and that there's a quarantine going on are all some pretty big issues that could take weeks or months to really come to terms with, and this situation has all of them mixed together.

Talk to her about taking everything one step at a time. You obviously have some catching up to do after living apart for so long. Just keep in touch and be there for her during the quarantine, and then try hanging out (maybe in public or without alcohol) once it's over."
1296,2020-04-18 16:04:58,g3ah09,This is trans fan fiction.  Think about the other posts you see on here.  Does this read like those?  Like something that someone is *remembering* from reality?  Or does it sound like a narrative someone wrote to be just so?  I mean come on.

1298,2020-04-17 21:28:09,g3ah09,"Eh, she's sensitive. She'll get over the lack of mutual interest. It's very likely she always had a thing for you. You'll move past it."

1301,2020-04-18 12:00:55,g3ah09,"This is fraught drunken exchange in the context of some major and fairly traumatic (disowned by parents, huge social disruption, risk of homelessness &c) life events and a period of very limited contact.

It's not a lack of empathy or expecting someone to do a 'mind wipe'. It's finding a situation overwhelming, for good reason."
1302,2020-04-18 13:23:09,g3ah09,"^ This. With everything she’s been through, and then the fact she tried to come onto you right after not really being in contact, I really think she just wanted to feel attractive. It’s very possible she’s been struggling to date if she’s interested in men and worries straight men will accuse her of being a “trap”; that may have even already happened. 
I don’t think this was calculated by any means, but her subconscious may have been saying “OP is someone who has already seen who I really am and loves me for it, so maybe I don’t have to worry about him getting stuck on my transition like I do with other men”. 
It’s unfortunate that once yo rejected her that she took that as a sign that all hope is lost for her to live as a woman, and didn’t recognize that your growing up together, not her transition, is what makes you not see her in that way.

I recommend you kindly but persistently reach out to her expressing support, ASAP. You should explain your feelings out once, but don’t make that the focus because I don’t think that is the heart of the issue. I also say ASAP because it sounds like your friend is in an extremely vulnerably place mentally, and there’s a reason the suicide rate for people who have transitioned is so high.

1307,2020-04-18 00:06:08,g3ah09,"Trans people are under no obligation to tell anyone about their transition. Coming out is hard and sometimes dangerous. She took a risk coming out to him and considering how nice he's being I'd say it paid off. Also trans people have a lot of pressure put on them to be ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" or ""wow you really look like ____ gender!""

Should she have kissed him? No, of course not. Kissing someone without their contact is wrong. It sounds like she's in a dark place right now and he's probably the nicest cis guy she's met in awhile. A lot of my TF friend's say that in there early years of transitioning they tended to only date cis men. They said, at the time, dating a guy felt like they were validated. Like the world really saw them as women. 

Early transition is complicated, and messy, and sometimes difficult explain; especially to people I knew you before you came out. I'm a trans guy and while my family sorta accepting me I only have one friend from before and it's now the strongest and most wonderful relationship I have. 

I would recommend having an honest conversation with your friend. The friendship might not work out but I think it's worth it.

(Also I hope that wasn't her actual deadname)"

OP’s BEST FRIEND was in a vulnerable situation, felt comfortable, was extremely emotional due to everything going on and was CONFUSED. You can get the vibe from this post that the kiss was not harmful and OP did not feel threatened that his best friend made a move on him. He was more concerned about her well being and the friendship he wanted to continue to have with her.

If someone believes that it’s NOT okay to be gay, yet they are attracted to people the same sex they are, historically it has been pretty common to try to repress those feelings and to even marry and have children with someone of the opposite sex. The lengths to which people will go to hide something like being gay have no limits when that person thinks they are wrong to be gay, due to a religious upbringing or expectations from their culture.

If the person acts homophobic and so does their friend, they can logically conclude that said friend is NOT into homosexuality, is NOT gay, and thus they will not ever be a romantic partner. 

But what if they aren’t a guy anymore? Being a girl will possibly place them where they want to be—that friend’s romantic partner. It’s a long shot, but what other chance do they have? 

Don’t underestimate what someone is willing to do to be with their romantic choice. People literally MURDER for this, you know."

There is usually a lot of therapy involved, there are a lots of psychological and medical gates to pass before people are able to transition. It can take years. It's not an overnight thing.  Dr's won't prescribe HRT, and no one will perform surgeries without passing through these gates. A murder for ""love"" is not even the same sport let alone in the same ballpark. Quite frankly, it's like saying baseball and spelunking are related. They are not even comparable. Transitioning isn't an act of passion (like murder can be a crime of passion). It is a long, highly conscious, highly controlled, and highly guarded process.

I have trans people in my life. I have watched what they go through to be who they are. It has been and can be agonizing for them to remake themselves into who they are and present themselves as themselves to the world, both known and unkown. Please don't diminish this by saying it can all happen because of a crush. It really can't."

No one needs to go through therapy or any of that other stuff to transition. They don’t need to choose to get surgeries or hormones. Those are things they might consider and if they do then there is some medical “gate keeping” usually. But it’s NOT something all choose, just as not all choose to wear different clothes or choose a different name or anything else. 

It definitely CAN happen because of a crush, just like murder can. That doesn’t mean it happened that way this time, but it doesn’t mean it didn’t either. 

When someone’s sexuality is unacceptable to them and/or their society or culture, there can be some extreme results. Remember, both of these people expressed homophobic and transphobic thoughts."

All that happened three years ago. Not that she won't still be upset about all that befell her, but she has had years to get used to what he just found out about...yesterday? Her aunt helped her. She has her own place, etc. She's had surgeries and HRT. Things are better for her. 

None of anything she went through excuses forcing a kiss on him. Nope."

1465,2020-04-01 02:36:58,fsh8b6,"Also, you didn't touch up on the ""can't be more than 1 or 2 percent"" point.

1 or 2 percent means between 3 and 7 million people in the USA alone

Even if it was 0.5%, that's over a million people.

Would you be OK with ignoring the needs of over a million people?

The number is likely around the 2-3% mark, though it's hard to estimate as many people who have less severe discomfort will often ignore it due to the perceived social rejection that's caused by people like OP. Same thing with gay men and women before the gay rights movement, and still continues to this day to some extent.

Transphobia not only effects trans people though, it also hurts intersex people who have ambiguous characteristics as well, which is upwards of an additional 1%. Plus a number of cis non-intersex people who have ambiguous characteristics, another ~0.5%-2%.

All in all, that leads to a potential of **16 million** people in the us alone that are negatively impacted by anti-trans rhetoric. Not to mention, a lot of anti-trans rhetoric turns out to be racist as well, a recent example is a recent ""guide"" being passed around transphobic circles on how to avoid dating trans women, one of the points in the guide makes mention of curly body hair, which happens to be quite common in women of several non-white populations. Such a point is likely to be far more detrimental to said women of colour, because it's totally not like trans women are well known for spending a ridiculous amount of time removing body hair, to the point where it's a stereotype of trans women.

Here's even more videos about various trans-related topics (incl. intersex-related topics):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91_5OOmK1TQ

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seUVb7gbrTY

Always be wary of where information comes from, who's using it, and what groups have to gain or lose by doing so. For example, The Heritage Foundation is a conservative ""think tank"" which is known for releasing ""studies"" that appear to show things in-favour of whatever position they hold [climate change denial, denying evolution, etc]. These studies are often easy to prove as complete nonsense and are full of methodological holes, they serve the sole purpose of being something that people who support those things can point to and be like ""see, studies proved it"" and completely ignore any points being made in opposition.

A historical point, and one nearly everyone but white supremacists will agree is bunk: ""Scientific"" racism. Nowadays, every scientist will agree that the studies published during the period of ""scientific"" racism are complete bunk now, but back then they were widely considered as true. Those who considered themselves to be ""normal"" (white people) wanted to come up with every reason possible to exclude other races from that definition so that they could continue slavery and other harmful practices.

In reality, humans are an extremely diverse species, nothing out of nature is black and white or binary, and compassion+respect for one another is the only way forward for any leftist movement, we can't leave anyone behind just because they're ""only 1%"" of us if they share the same struggles that we do. This isn't a zero-sum game, it's important to listen to and understand the needs of everyone, the left has far more in common with each other than they have differences.

Dividing people is the number one go to move of the elite, keeping people arguing over race/gender/sex/etc distracts us from turning our focus to the elite and realizing how many of our problems are caused by them."

It's not just that you're a bigot, you're wrong. Even biological sex, though there is a clear distinction between two groups, has some variation on a bunch of metrics.

When it comes to gender, which is literally just a bunch of performative roles and societal expectations, there isn't even a question."
1470,2020-04-01 08:43:55,fsh8b6,">In reality, humans are an extremely diverse species, nothing out of nature is black and white or binary

Just as a side-note: putting things in a binary is a really good first approximation. That's all societies have a gender alignment with sexual dimorphism, and then there are corrections built on top of that model. But even being a really good approximation, when you reach its limits it stops being accurate. It's the same reason why Newtonian physics is fantastically accurate, until you start reaching speeds comparable with the speed of light."
1471,2020-04-01 19:20:12,fsh8b6,">I identify as black.

Yeah, that's not how this works. Race is a matter of how you're perceived in society.

But look, I understand where you're coming from: race is bullshit. It's not an objective thing, and its only purpose is to sow division between us. I'd like to live in a world without race.

> Speaking of, why don't all you woke transgender advocates go the the  black community with picket signs saying they are all bigots.   

Because that would just be stupid. You don't defend your point by being aggressive against communities (unless it's actual hate groups), you do it by affirming your points. Which is what I'm doing here.

1474,2020-04-01 08:57:56,fsh8b6,"I suppose that's fair, but the key word here is *approximation*.

As long as nobody forgets that it's merely a way of describing common things, and not the definition of those things itself, than we're all good because any exceptions are easy to add.

Another thing to note, the second definition of gender, which relates to grammar/usage in language, doesn't necessarily correlate to the first definition, as grammatical gender/pronouns/etc can be completely unrelated to that: for example, it's possible for a language to use grammatical gender to describe how human-like an object is, with humans getting one set of pronouns, non-human animals getting another, and inanimate objects getting another. It's also possible for a society and its language to have no concept of gender whatsoever, though I don't know of any off the top of my head, or if that's even ever happened at all. Hence why gender is referred to as a social construct, because it is, it's arbitrary groups which many societies, but not all, relate to physical appearance, typically, but not always, related to secondary sexual characteristics and/or self-identity."

If you're male you are gay and just feel pressure to be straight.  But WHATEVER, agree to disagree, you said to stop feeding the troll so stop feeding me."
1477,2020-04-01 00:19:18,fsh8b6,"> Gender is either xx or xy, 

No, that's biological sex. And even that isn't clear cut as it might seem. For example, children have almost no distinctive sexual characteristics, and with ageing distinctions fade away too. There are also intersex conditions, some of which aren't caused by chromosomal abnormalities, but by other factors, such as the uterine hormonal environment.

But that's not the discussion. Gender is performance. It's how you behave in society.

&#x200B;

> Just curious, if I discriminate in dating transgender women am I  bigoted or is it just my preference that I prefer not to fuck another  man in the asshole? 

In your case, both. Having sexual preferences is legitimate, calling them men is bigoted. If I didn't want to have sex with a trans person, it would just be a matter of preference."

Exactly

&#x200B;

I was referring to gender as the set of social behavior norms. With grammatical gender, it is different, yes."
1479,2020-04-01 02:59:52,fsh8b6,">In your case, both. Having sexual preferences is legitimate, calling them men is bigoted. If I didn't want to have sex with a trans person, it would just be a matter of preference.

Refusing to date someone for the reason that they're trans is still bigoted [As it shows that on some level, consciously or not, you think that they're inferior to cis people in some way], refusing to date them because they're infertile or don't have the set of genitals you prefer, etc, however, is not bigoted. Though doing so on the infertile point is still somewhat of an asshole move because many straight cis couples don't find out about infertility until well into their relationship, and there are many other options for raising a family, such as adoption."
1480,2020-04-01 08:47:24,fsh8b6,"It's not thinking they're inferior, and especially that they deserve fewer rights. It's a matter of sexual preference, because no trans person looks exactly like a cis person. I'll admit it, I probably wouldn't have a problem with it, but I understand why someone would."
1481,2020-04-01 16:39:25,fsh8b6,"So you'd date trans person?  Would you be the bottom or the top?  That's called gay btw, in case your ""straight"", but what are words if everything is on a spectrum.  You guys are the poster children of why people refuse to vote Democratic even if they believe in a lot of our policies."
1482,2020-04-01 09:51:03,fsh8b6,"> because no trans person looks exactly like a cis person.

No cis person looks exactly like any other cis person either, plus when it comes to a blind test of passing trans people, you'd be extremely hard-pressed to spot any differences between trans and cis people.

Now of course, there are trans people who don't pass as well, but that is kind of beyond the point I was trying to make.

There are also cis women who are naturally less feminine than some trans women are naturally. Though it is worth mentioning that trans women that are naturally extremely feminine are often intersex to some degree, though not always, and it may be years into transition before some of these trans women learn that, if ever. 

Naturally here being without external intervention, hormones, surgery, etc.

Another thing to note, the percentage of the population with some degree of intersex traits could be as high as **60%**, though it's unlikely to be that high and 10-12% is a much more reasonable high-end estimate, because there are a lot of categories, reproduction is notorious being *just* consistent enough to work most of the time, and people don't get obscure tests done if there is no issue. Take genetic mosaicism for example, that's when something has two or more genetically different sets of cells. Or chimerism, which is essentially a more extreme version of mosaicism. In more recent times, it's been estimated that a very large percentage of humans could have varying degrees of the two, but with most having such tiny genetic differences that no issues arise. Now when you factor that into calculations, and that many intersex conditions, such as Trisomy X, already typically have few symptoms if any. You end up with the possibility of someone only having some of their cells contain the intersex mutation, which will have even less likelihood of having visible symptoms [look at mosaic down syndrome for example, which in some individuals can end up never being diagnosed.]

Sex is a bimodal distribution, which somewhat breaks down the ""cis"" and ""trans"" groups you seem to be using, hence why more recently ""transgender"" has been defined as ""having a gender identity differing from the categorisation you were placed into at birth"" which includes quite a few intersex people as well, and ""cisgender"" being ""having a gender identity that matches the categorisation you were placed into at birth"".

The easiest way to make the most amount of people happy would be to do away with assigning sex/gender at birth and let people decide themselves how they want express themselves. Essentially, get rid of the gender roles society currently places on people and just let people be themselves. Even if 95-99% end up going down the same path they would either way, the quality of life of that 1-5% will be so much better than it is now. It would also drastically reduce many other things related to gender roles: such as men having a much higher suicide rate than women, something that is strongly linked to the expectation typically placed on men to always appear ""strong"" and not discuss their feelings and struggles, thus being less likely to seek out a mental health professional, which more often than not leads to the problem [depression, etc] worsening.

---

tl;dr: nature doesn't give a shit about what humans think. gender roles are a fuck, they're archaic and should be done away with. plus my initial main point was missed.

My initial main point, was that if you met a woman, were initially attracted to her, then later learnt she was trans, and suddenly didn't want anything to do with her because of that, then *that* would be transphobic."
1483,2020-04-01 19:52:12,fsh8b6,"A lesbian dating a trans woman is indeed still a gay relationship, good of you to notice, the opposite would be true of a lesbian dating a trans man, which is why it doesn't happen. Also, words are approximate descriptors of points on whatever spectrum you're referring to, always have been, always will be. Absolute descriptors only exist for human-made concepts such as maths.

1486,2020-04-01 23:12:47,frv40x,"They absolutely aren’t helping anyone. My kid (with years of mental health issues including being bipolar) went to planned parenthood and walked out with a prescription for hormones and testosterone blockers. After a 20 minute appointment. 20 minutes.

We can argue for hours about whether transitioning is right or wrong (in his case it’s definitely wrong) but what is wrong is a system that takes no interest in your medical history, your current mental health issues and your ability to understand what you are about to do to your body. The long term implications of these drugs aren’t explained.  And once the results of studies that have been done in Europe (long term hormone replacement treatment and the correlation to brain tumours or studies on the short life expectancy of transgender people) become more widely known, there will be lawsuits by the bucket load. But at the expense of how many lives lost? 

But to the OP...well done. I applaud you for coming this far and I wish you well for the future. I  only wish others would be as smart as you!

1493,2020-03-30 20:36:37,frv40x,"It seems to be the ""informed"" part that is lacking in these clinics. So people are giving consent but not really being informed properly."
1494,2020-03-31 00:06:29,frv40x,"But is that true? A woman in the UK sued a ""gender identity clinic"" about a month ago for giving her drugs to help her ""transition"" to live as a boy when she was a teenager. Though I can't find recent updates on the case, and I don't think it's been settled yet. I'm guessing she also signed consent papers but still apparently has the grounds to sue, though of course no word yet on whether she won."
1495,2020-03-31 04:23:00,frv40x,"So if I opened a clinic that promised to cure Covid19 with voodoo I should be protected from lawsuits when people died because I was trying to help people? Trans medicine is untested, unproven and harmful."

You know what I think is bullshit? Giving mentally unstable people damaging drugs based on one appointment, drugs they have no physical need for. 
It's easy to say take responsibility for your actions, but what about when people aren't capable of understanding the risks? How can you obtain informed consent when even the doctor prescribing isn't aware of the long-term risks? 
The more people sue the better, these clincs aren't going to stop because of the damage they're doing. They're only going to stop when it's no longer fiancially viable, which means the more lawsuits the better."

Another question, did you meet or interact other people struggling with gender whom may have abused drugs like a.d.d meds, depression meds as adolescents? I’ve noticed everyone I knew who has experienced it did. I feel like for some individuals this might be a cause or may have had some validity. It might explain why this generation is so seeming effected more then others. My gen was the one where everyone was putting their kids of meds for everything before their brains were properly developed.  It’s just something I’ve noticed."

Im not defending informed consent, on the contrary I think its dangerous however I dont think lawsuits are the best way to go about changing things"
1501,2020-03-31 20:36:10,frv40x,"She didn't sue them, it's not that kind of case, she's not seeking damages. The aim of her case is a judicial review of GIDs ""treatment"" plan and the way the whole thing works. Basically a legal review of whether or not the way they do things is legally sound. 
It's so frustrating seeing it be reported in the media (and then repeated unthinkingly online) as her ""suing the clinic""."
1502,2020-03-31 12:48:54,frv40x,"By the way you used a strawman as the points is informed consent not malpractice. The specialist just do what he know to cure gender dysphoria : transitionning. 

An informed adult who lie about hes fetichistic motivation (AGP or HSTS as you know as a gc) to pass gatekeeping in order to take a treatement designed for actually trans people it's not a professionnal fault. It's just you being ashamed and refusing to take acount for your mistake.

 - no forced conversions
 - no psychological abuse
 - Just informed consent
 And OP just act like actual trans people doesn't exist, he is demanding to enforce gatekeeping for THEM because HE made a mistake. There's nothing wrong in doing a mistake, the most important is to find what's make you happy after aknowledging it."
1503,2020-03-31 04:30:28,frv40x,"Trans medicine is a completely novel medical area and shouldn't be treated the same way as far as liability compared with infectious disease.

No offense, but I have noticed this desire to retaliate against trans orgs and medical centers comes primarily from FTMs.  As I said, some of it stems from not wanting to take responsibility of your own actions.

I agree that a lot of naive people transition and don't have anyone to challenge them, but that doesn't make these places liable for the decisions by these people.

I don't think you will understand until you work in an industry on the receiving end of frequent litigation."
1504,2020-04-02 21:32:49,frv40x,"I can't say that I personally know of anyone meeting that description.

1506,2020-03-31 03:50:34,frv40x,"I disagree. I think lawsuits are a fantastic way to bring this insanity to an end. Once there is precedent set that a medical provider can be held liable for erroneously prescribing hormones or performing surgery on someone who identifies as trans but is actually just confused, providers across the world will become more hesitant to prescribe hormones or perform surgeries. Even if no such precedent is set, the threat of litigation itself will be a deterrent. Lots of regretful transitioners=lots of lawsuits."

People who don't know Shapiro's brand are now endorsing and even attempting to propagate it through TwoSet. This outcome is not apolitical.  


(2) TwoSet does not tend to host or review political personalities. If they reviewed a myriad of YouTubers and Ben Shapiro happened to be in the mix, I would say ""okay, weird choice, oh, this guy isn't half-bad, that's a surprise,"" but that's not what happened. They've given him an implicit endorsement by hosting him because they haven't hosted others.

I do not think TwoSet were considering the full consequences of their actions at the time of making the video. The impression I got was they were on a mission to roast the man (see the title image for the video - they were obviously trying to make fun of him), but didn't find what they were looking for, and the video went up anyway, probably in the name of integrity of the review."

I am an experienced astral projector and have some degree of psychic ability. I experience synchronicities constantly.

But I've learned over time not to put too much weight in them and not to take them too seriously. They just kind of happen. I don't know why, and I don't put significant faith in them. I would never make a life decision based on a synchronicity, for example.

It is also possible that history is constantly shifting or being rewritten (a la Mandela effect) while these cartoons and films are somehow immune or serve as warnings, or that there is indeed a malevolent enterprise orchestrating the path of our human civilization, that loves to mock us in plain sight.

It could also be a combination of all three. I have occasionally tried to 'knock on the door' of the malevolent enterprise but have faced retribution or been blocked out. I think there might be some kind of unspoken armistice going on where they stay on their side, we stay on our side, but everyone else is up for grabs.

It's also possible to use incarnated beings as conduits, so it's entirely possible 'seth macfarlane' has no idea what's going on. In fact, he could have been incarnated where he was, with the gifts he has, for the purpose of being used as a conduit.

Just speculating, and take anything I say with a grain of salt."

1605,2020-05-01 00:40:53,gapi36,"Great work. I'm going to try to connect some dots here so bear with me...

Simpsons, Family Guy, and American Dad have all shown that they have predictive capabilities. All three shows air on Fox. A recent post regarding the Yellow Cube and Project looking glass highlighted the connection between the Yellow Cube and the Simpsons predicting the future. The post is listed below along with a nice video/doc about Project Looking Glass.

I'm just putting this together as I'm typing so bear with me. But there is a connection with Project Looking Glass/Yellow Cube, Fox and Donald Trump. Many of you may know that Donald Trump's uncle worked for the FBI and assisted in the seizure of Tesla's assets, many of which included Tesla's time travel research. This is a pretty well known conspiracy around these parts and fairly easy to search in this sub.  It doesn't really need explained but Fox News loves trump, end of story.

Time Travel -> Fox Television -> Trump:  Those are the connected dots.

What does this mean? Did Fox know that Seth MacFarlane was getting on the 9/11 flight and somehow keep him from going? Did Trump's uncle have connections at Fox or did someone at Fox stumble across this Yellow Cube/Project Looking Glass information that apparently is assisting Trump and the faction within the government that is supporting him? Is why (in addition to being Republican) Fox News supports Trump?

If the Simpsons and Trump are on the same team and saving the world together I will fucking lose it, in a good way.

""Or maybe it's all just a coincidence."" Yeah, I've heard that theory too."

The next one you want to look out for is Vince Gilligan.   Breaking Bad is about a Rockford, Il drug network and Bryan Cranstons Walter White is a direct composite of the head of it.

My favorite is when the artist is also deep into conspiracies and makes shit like the original DOOM, Aeon Flux (animated), and try to offer a glimpse into how this shit is looking to play out in the future, if it isn't happening already in space.

Like just another quick example is the art on this [album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe2eWqZgYCo&list=RDVjAo3oX27UM&index=6)

In 2016 I wrote a script for an absurdist nightmare comedy short film involving clowns pestering the protagonist five months before those clown sighting videos started to happen. 5 months later we shot a scene where the protagonist is attacked by clowns in a dark alleyway. Unaware of the recent ""clown sightings"", we got the cops called on us because they thought they were the same clowns they saw on the internet. Usually the rhymes/syncs are more subtle and personal, affecting me or the cast, but that really blew me away (also I was under the influence of lsd when I wrote that specific scene).

At some point he rolls under the door to Roger's locker and says ""if I've just discovered I'm the Lindbergh baby, whom should I contact?"" As you probably know, there's some confusion in Mandela Effect circles about the fate of the Lindbergh baby.

Another one is an episode where Francine is doing some ironing and talking to Roger. Roger says something about ""the iron and the lamb"", obviously in reference to the Biblical ""lion and the lamb"". But as we all know now, the Bible verse seems to be about the ""wolf and the lamb"" - no mention of the lion and the lamb.

Finally (not a Mandela Effect) - there's an episode of the Cleveland Show where they're doing a live episode. At the end Cleveland is hurriedly trying to thank everyone involved and at the very end he shouts ""9/11 was an inside job!"""

Minus its racism America would be unrecognizable for every one of its 244 years of genocide paved history. Something like 420 years since the first slaves in chains reached the then Brit colonies and y'all still find treating non€uros like shit the fun part of your day."

1757,2020-04-30 22:41:41,gapi36,"You can easily explain the attacks happening near 9:11 am by saying they're painting the picture of the attack happening at the start of the workday. Why would someone attack a building at 7 am when no one is inside? That would be a poorly planned attack. The twin towers were also a beacon for the City of New York, of course, Hollywood would use these buildings in their movies to have a stronger emotional reaction for the viewer. If the terrorists chose to attack Lady Liberty in NYC instead you could find plenty of videos and movies depicting the same thing. You could easily exchange those ""predictive programming/symbolism"" with any major monument or notable building. Throw enough crap at a wall and sooner or later things will stick.

And then all the freeze frames on the clocks like that means something, it doesn't. You could use all these videos for if the attack happened on 9/10 because what comes before 9/11... 9/10. You could find plenty of movies that freeze-frame at any timestamp. But why would movies showtimes at all you may say? How often did you see a movie or a TV show that would show a timer on a bomb with 40 seconds remaining and you would then count down in your head, suddenly that 40-second timer lasted for 4 minutes of fighting.

Just think a little and all these things can easily be explained in some way to help the audience feel immersed.

EDIT: Oh man the whole fighting at the pyramids... come on. Why do you think the writer chose that? Because they know the audience associates pyramids with mystical things. People grew up watching shows where pyramids were spaceships. This whole video comes off assuming we're the first generation to ever think the Illuminati is a secret organization. Come on people think of practical reasons before assuming something is a conspiracy."

There are three OBVIOUS 9-11 references, including a 9-11 written into the passport of the main character and dialog like ""I had been in New York for nine minutes and eleven seconds and I was already ruined.""    Chemtrails, pedophilia, ritual sacrifice, are all part of the show.   THIS IS THE ONE TO WATCH if you want to see whats been up their sleeve for the last 30 years or more.   

Its predictive programming that goes beyond 9-11 too.   Just like how Back to the Future references 9-11 and Trump, there is more and more that becomes obvious with time - and we are living through what has already planned a long time ago.   Oh, Trump is mentioned in The Freshman too.   As people start to sift through the older movies we're going to start to see that Trump has been in their cards for a long time."

No, but with an understanding of probabilities and statistics, one realizes that as the number of consecutive heads goes up so do the chances of your having involvement in the outcome. It may be a change of 0.01*10^20 versus 0.01*10^19, but when the sequence frequency is consistent you have an increasing probability of additional factors. 

You have a 50/50 chance of picking heads every time, but if your ""correct pick rate"" exceeds 50% correct over, say, 100+ trials there is a high probability that you are influencing the outcome or have foreknowledge of some sort. Is it possible that you could guess correctly 75% of the time? Yes. But it is also likely at that point that you know something that everyone else doesn't."
1846,2020-04-30 14:30:17,gapi36,"Okay, what I mean is take 16 versus 17 for instance. In 16 you could play it off as coincidence because it's highly likely those events would all be depicted together (Christ's church - yeah it's not going to be called Mohammed's mosque; burned down - there's biblical implication there; etc.). But with 17 what are the chances of so many things being in the same skit (bat watching stocks fall, a helicopter crash, etc.). They're such absurd plot points to introduce together (from a story telling perspective) that it seems beyond coincidence. Maybe using 17 is a poor example because I don't think anyone could have predicted all this, but with only about 120 helicopter crashes per year and about 28,000 ""famous"" people in America, the chances of them being in one of the 120 yearly crashes to bring it into the national spotlight is pretty low. Granted celebrities are more likely to be in helicopters, but still, having it happen within proximity to a bat-borne pandemic is, statistically, beyond coincidence in my mind. But stranger things can and do happen."

1918,2020-05-17 17:15:21,g8g6xt,"I've been poking at this topic in my head for the last few weeks, but haven't been able to formulate a clear thought about it until now.

As a nonbinary-identified transgender woman, I may have a qualitatively different experience of my transness than binary trans people do, but to me that saying ""our sexed bodies have nothing to do with our personal identity"" feels like a mistake. To me **it is exactly in rebuke of that idea that I claim transness as part of my identity**. 

It's my suspicion that much of the insistence from trans people that there be such a clear distinction between our bodies and our identities comes as an attempt to elicit acceptance of our basic right to claim that our trans identities are possible. What I believe is that, as (or if?) trans identity becomes ""acceptable"", what we can find is a way to talk about the ways that our identities *do* reflect the vital role our embodiment plays in our identities. As we exist with so little power in our society, and indeed even have to fight for basic recognition and safety, we will overstate our case in the interest of protecting ourselves. Thus, the whole argument is a red herring, a straw man we were pushed to construct for our opponents to attack so we could hide safely behind it.

Interestingly, the idea that Broussard takes from St. Thomas feels like an overextension of embodiment's role in determining us - one to which transgender identity offers a valuable counterpoint. Particularly, he says:

> If the soul of a living thing is its *vital principle*, which it is, then it necessarily follows that the soul is also the principle of that thing’s *vital activities*. And since it is obvious that there are different living things with different types of activities, then there must be different types of souls.

To me, his conclusion that ""bodies are different, so their souls must be different"" depends on some assumption that isn't articulated here. (That's me being generous - what I really feel is that he's making a logical leap because he has his goal in mind and his bias has convinced him that his point is good enough to excuse it, if he even sees the mistake in the first place.)

I studied Cognitive Science in college, and so I (probably wrongly) think I'm decently qualified to speak on the nature of thought. To my understanding, rationality is simply a capacity of human bodies - humanity's great evolution, from a neurostructural standpoint, is the neocortex, which grants us the biological capacity for abstract reasoning. Therefore it seems trivial to me to accept our rationality *as a fact of our bodies* rather than an aspect of our souls. (St. Thomas of Aquinas couldn't have known that, so I forgive him the oversight.)

While it's true that our rational faculties set us apart from all other life, the claim that human souls are somehow different from other souls because our bodies possess the capacity for rational thought seems problematic. I suspect that this claim arises from the Christian need to justify our work of ""being saved"". After all, if we had the same souls as plants and bugs, then what does it mean that God set man apart from those things and gave him dominion, etc?

I believe that we are ensouled in rational bodies, and that our rationality is not a quality of our souls themselves but is a *position* or *state* of our souls because of our presence in these bodies. Man alone was given reason, and Man alone chose to turn away from God. Does that imply that to be Man is the work chosen for ""rational"" souls, which alone have a native capacity to resist God? Or does it imply that any soul embodied as Man, whose body has a native capacity to resist God, must bear the burden of sin?

Applying Occam's razor (which according to wikipedia was originally stated as ""Entities should not be multiplied without necessity.""), it seems to me that the latter answer is more likely. After all, is it simpler to suppose a singular soul-shape in a multiplicity of bodies, or a multiplicity of soul-shapes in a multiplicity of bodies?

I look to the book of Genesis, and I see that when God formed us, he also *told us what to do and not do*. Our work as Man is to overcome the sinful state in which we live by leaving aside the things our bodies and our wills demand in favor of God's body and God's will. The great lesson of Christ is not just that we are loved, that we are saved; in Luke 22:42, Jesus himself says: ""Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done."" Christ shows us that God gives us the power to overcome sin to return to Him by *de-identifying with all that our rational selves hold true except that which God has given us*.

To cap this off by returning to the subject of trans identity - it seems to me that there is something fundamentally *un*-reasoned in claiming to be of a gender that your body doesn't express. My claim that I am a woman despite my male-assigned body required me to surrender my attempts to argue one way or the other; I have no idea where this voice inside me comes from  or why for my whole life it's begged, in whispers and shouts, for me to live as a woman. I tried to fight it, tried to kill it, tried to ignore it. It never gave me a single reason to trust it or way to justify it. It just never stopped.

Following that voice taught me the essential movement of Faith, which has in turn brought me into relationship with God. I don't see my soul as male or female, any more than I see my soul as rational. The fact that I'm trans is a state of my body, which is recognized by my soul. That this ""isn't allowed"" is a reasoned conclusion of men, and I reject it in favor of the mystery I answer in claiming this identity. I celebrate the complexity of my soul's relationship with my body, and I honor God by living in the belief that He made me as He saw fit."

1995,2020-06-25 17:11:18,hfdenm,"OK, just to be clear. 

These are the **Webers**. Plural.

Weber's is possessive singular, meaning the possessive of just **one** Weber. 

Webers' would be possessive plural, meaning the possessive of a whole family of Webers.

Sometimes this sub makes me worried about the state of grammar in America. 

Everyone go buy a copy of Dreyer's English."

2035,2020-06-25 13:02:24,hfdenm,"Yeah, she’s a shitty person who essentially abandoned her kids from her first marriage for the Kardashian/Jenners."
2036,2020-06-25 13:25:46,hfdenm,Yeah she really is so annoying. Its great she brought awareness to transgender people but she is far from a good spokesperson for the lgbt community. Although granted that just makes her normal like everyone else. Shitty people in all circles.

2051,2020-06-27 13:37:13,hfdenm,Haha I hate unnecessary apostrophes. At my old work there were always notices that said “paramedics and EMT’s make sure...” or whatever but EMTs was ALWAYS written EMT’s... !!!

2074,2020-06-25 05:30:36,hfdenm,"She's surprisingly anti-LGBTQ+ and has made sexist remarks previously. She basically thinks her experience as a trans woman represents every experience and says some insensitive things as a result (""the hardest thing about being a woman is deciding what to wear"")"
2075,2020-06-25 14:25:17,hfdenm,"To add to what else has been said...She also doesn't recognize how privileged her transition was. 

So many trans women cannot just go under the knife and emerge a beautiful butterfly. And yet she speaks as if her story is representative of all trans women. Like, sis, you're a millionaire who can afford the best doctors, bodyguards, etc. It's rough when you can't even be an ally to your own community. She's not some trans icon -- she's privileged AF, and the LEAST that she could do is recognize that."
2076,2020-06-25 04:52:22,hfdenm,"Aside from her personal transgressions, which can be up for debate/opinion, (like how she treated the Kardashian women after her divorce from Kris and how she largely wasn’t in the Jenner boys’ life), she also voted for Trump & said he was good for women & LGBTQ+ issues. She’s since reversed her stance on that but... the damage is done.

2079,2020-06-25 16:44:46,hfdenm,This isn't a political thread so I'm going to tread carefully but you can google who she campaigned for in the past (although to be fair she changed course in 2018 - also available on google). For a while she was very much against LGBTQ+ rights. It was strange.
2080,2020-06-25 02:58:57,hfdenm,SHIRTS VS. SKINS....who was skins
2081,2020-06-25 04:56:59,hfdenm,true story: i am forever blocked on facebook by a former classmate because she started a photography business and was watermarking families’ photos with their names using apostrophes and i was like “hi if u are gonna charge ppl money for this plz make sure u understand basic grammar!!!”

You should be able to look it up it was iconic

2098,2020-06-25 13:18:00,hfdenm,She’s the perfect example of how having white privileged and being rich makes it possible to ignore the violence perpetuated against members of your community who don’t have that privilege. Doesn’t affect her so she doesn’t care.

2121,2020-06-25 08:29:32,hfdenm,"I read a great analysis on how Dany’s arc was always meant to be a tragedy based on the books and if done right in the show I think it could’ve been great.

However in the show I found her demise to be low key misogynistic because they made every female leader (Cersei and Dany) seem too emotional to rule. And I don’t consider Sansa being “Queen of the North” a win because that too came across as a consolation prize and also dumb"

2126,2020-06-25 20:37:39,hfdenm,Hahaha I couldn’t remember which one she used but your comment made me laugh so thank you
2127,2020-06-25 06:27:16,hfdenm,Yep. That was the entire problem with the last season. Most could have made sense if there was more time. Except Jaime. His character ending is inexcusable.
2128,2020-06-25 11:16:20,hfdenm,"You’re so right. It was inevitable I think, we all kind of suspected she may go mad, but there was no preamble! It was ‘Free the oppressed!’ - ‘Murder the innocent...’ 😕 It’s like at the end D&D dgaf so they just leapfrogged to where they wanted to be and ended it."
2129,2020-06-25 09:33:51,hfdenm,"There's a famous quote from the book 'Madness and Greatness are two sides of the same coin. Every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss the coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how it will land'. Dany walks between Madness and Greatness all the time.

I wouldn't call it misogynistic when there were several horrible male rulers that were also talked about through out the series. Robert drank and hunted through his period. Aerys got off of burning people alive. Dany was hailed as a feminist icon for most of the time the series was airing. Cersei is who she is because of her situations. She is emotionally unstable. She is extremely paranoid. Her father instilled it in her.

Sansa becoming the Queen of the North is an absolute fucking win for me. It is so fucking difficult to run the day to day administrations of an area as vast as the North. It is basically separated from the rest of Westeros. To earn the respect of the Northern houses is huge. An outsider cannot come and achieve that as easily. Sansa rebuilt Winterfell from its ruins. She is the reason Ramsay was defeated and they got their home back. Sansa wanting to go to the South and be a lady in her childhood only to realize it's horrible and she just wants to be home and look out for her family is not dumb and it is definitely not a consolation price."
2130,2020-06-25 09:54:42,hfdenm,"Sansa has foreshadowing of her being a Queen from the start. Her becoming Queen in her own right and defending the independence of the North was such a win for me. She played the game good, with honor and she actually cared for the Smallfolk. Sansa deserves to be in charge of her own destiny and there is no one else who logically should’ve had the northern crown but her."
2131,2020-06-25 04:49:31,hfdenm,Maybe he flies her private jet...
2132,2020-06-25 08:39:58,hfdenm,"I mean they are practically neighbors and grew up in similar areas, so maybe more than we think"
2133,2020-06-25 13:29:51,hfdenm,Wow I never noticed Ariana tans herself so much.
2134,2020-06-25 18:05:21,hfdenm,"I still think Liz and Victoria are better singers than Ariana though. At least Liz is , she’s freakin fantastic. Her range is incredible, she can hit some notes down low Ariana never could , nor I who is a soprano and couldn’t dream of singing anything low lol."
2135,2020-06-25 09:12:59,hfdenm,"This is my feeling with both. If they had led up to her going mad, fine. But they flipped her entire character arc in one episode. It just wasn’t right and didn’t make sense.

As for Jamie, he had truly redeemed himself. Still angry about that.

And Cersei deserved a worse, more public death than a pile of rocks.

I am still salty."
2136,2020-06-25 16:01:08,hfdenm,"It could have been such a good arc for Dany if it was built up properly, but they wanted to be done so badly they just did a lot of telling you she was crazy instead of showing you she was crazy. If D&D wanted to be done so badly they should have handed the show off to somebody who would have done it justice. Hurt them in the end too."
2137,2020-06-25 10:04:04,hfdenm,"I would’ve liked to see Sansa _really_ become Queen. Especially over Bran 

But only making the North independent of all the kingdoms and not any other isn’t politically smart because it will cause further tension and division in the future. It accomplished nothing and It felt like a consolation prize because instead of actually making her Queen they (the writers) just gave Sansa a consolation prize. It felt cheap and she deserved better"

2141,2020-06-25 21:33:28,hfdenm,I totally agree! Just about anyone in the whole world could’ve done a better job than them. And they really had all they needed for it to be epic! They just shouldn’t have rushed it like that.

Another has fallen to the trans cult on your watch.

Your woman card has been revoked, until you rack up enough suffering points in order to get it back.

Suffering points can be racked by doing one or more of the following:

-Misgender a transgendered, insult them as much as possible and then cry for 3 hours and 56 minutes exactly, after they retaliate by calling you a ""TERF"". Obviously it may seem like much, but you have failed your son, and above all, you failed US.

-Walk around town calling yourself a cum basket and make sure nobody thinks you are joking! It must seem authentic so you can progress our agenda!

What? What do you mean this isn't feminist? But of course it is!

-Get sexually assaulted by evil transgendereds 5 times.

Why 5? Well then, let's make it 6!

-Give birth to the right gender this time! Yes, you heard me right! You must get pregnant and give birth to a REAL WOMAN to further progress our anti-male agenda!

Only after accomplishing some of those and racking up enough points, we may give you your woman card back.

Until then?

Well....

Idk, join the trannies? They are a bunch of freaks anyway, I'm sure they won't mind another one.

You could even join their groups and casually insult them and disguise it as irony, these morons will believe anything!

2168,2020-06-21 14:57:42,hd5zog,"As a tranny-killer, I have to observe the conduct of my prey for a bit before killing them and writing in my Grimm book about my exploits.  Here's what I've gathered:

1) Every time they pass a mirror, they tweeze some hairs somewhere on their face.  Sometimes the eyebrows, but sometimes the moustache area, beard, or even the nose.  (They make the scariest faces when the pull out nasal hairs.)

2) Apparently they don't take any tests anymore and just will affirm that everyone is trans.  'We're all valid'.  Its... pathetic.

3) Right now, they're all into catgirls.  Yes, I know. Ten years ago it was bunny girls.  Times change.

4) Most of the time I see them watch TV, its hentai or anime.  My last prey was addicted to something called ""Naruto"" that starred the most annoying teenage ninja.  I wanted to poke my eyes out during that surveillance

5) They don't seem to listen to Taylor so much, despite Taylor being trans supportive.  K-pop seems to be rising in popularity.

6) Three kills ago, the person was on a Discord called ""TransLater"" which is for retired men who have nothing to live for and try to reclaim their youth by dressing as women.  On that server, half the people were named Rachael, and the other half Sarah.  But I think that nowadays the most common name for younger trans women is 'Latrina'.

7) half a decade? decade? what's the difference?  well, i think that the commonwealth of independanat states doesn't exist.  So you can take all the pills you want and you still can't go to the CIS.  Time machine might help.

8) bathroom executions do happen in the US, but they're not as common as FoxNews (which brags about them) and PinkNews (which laments them) leads us to believe.  so its best to call ahead to the establishment where you'll use the public restroom to alert them that a tranny might be coming at a certain time and that they need the local Joint Christian Identity, TERF and Russian Orthodox Army troops to send someone there.  (Despite the name, the best they can usually manage is a late 40s balding ex Wendy's cashier with acne and a pot belly that makes him look 9 months pregnant.  Usually named Larry.)  This can lead to being shot as long as Larry's tire doesn't go flat on the way to your bathroom invasion location.

OH... and if you DM me, I can help you find a conversion therapy specialist in your area.  as a side bonus, i can help you with a gofundme for breast removal surgery.  assuming you have any.

7) Injections work better than pills, does it have any other effect? I would build a time machine, but as a retarded tranny I don't have the mental capacity to do that. Obviously.

It used to be a place where women got treated equally as men. A woman hits a dude and the dude hits her back. ""Equal rights, equal lefts"" as they say. But recently, there have been an increasing number of videos that make me question the equality of this retaliation and the responses from a lot of these people are completely sexist and misogynistic. I'm convinced that a bunch of T\_D idiots and incels invaded that subreddit because there's a lot of alt-right narrative shit going on there too. Any sort of forward thinking comments gets downvoted into oblivion and somehow antifa gets brought up from time to time."

Then if you try to call them out for it they ask why you're trying to defend someone who committed manslaughter/whatever else. Sorry but there isn't any event that gives you a pass to act transphobic, homophobic, racist etc while still maintaining the label of not being a transphobe, homophobes, racist etc. 

I mean I don't like Caitlyn Jenner, or more accurately I don't really give a shit but whatever, but do these cis people think that trans people won't be offended when they start misgendering her and using slurs? It's the same as any issue, to be trans isn't a privilege which has to be earned through good behaviour and upstanding citizenry (or what any individuals idea of that is), it's a right and a part of who someone is that doesn't just go away and become the subject of mockery when it's convenient. I'm just so fucking sick of the people who think themselves open minded while having the stance of ""oh I don't care about what people do in their bedroom or what they want to be called, but you better believe I'm going to ridicule the very concept of transgenderism if you piss me off"". No, you're a closed minded bigot who only let's out their bigotry selectively because you know you'll be ridiculed by society for having a hateful, shitty opinion."

>Besides, you have to actively ignore the difference between gender and sex to do it.

Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to, and differentiating between, masculinity and femininity. ""Man"" or ""woman"" are not genders, rather ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" are. The definition has changed in recent years to appease the trans gender narrative, but the actual definition of ""gender"" does not include the self-assignment of ""man"" and ""woman"".

Spanish is a pretty sexist language.

When talking about groups of people the gender neutral form is just the male one (ellos).

I'd like to know the difference between 'xe' and 'they'. Why can a gender neutral pronoun not just be a gender neutral pronoun? 

What is the validity behind created pronouns? What makes one gender neutral pronoun different from another?

And the whole gender thing comes from an established construct. Where does this created pronoun fit into an already existing construct that already exists? 

How do you come upon a few random letters that never existed together before and decide that those are your pronouns, instead of just using the already available gender neutral pronouns?"

At the end of the day I don't deny them their existence, I accept their identity as valid and feel they deserve to live in society just as everyone else, I'm just not cool with made up pronouns. 

As far as being a jerk goes, I can live with that, lmfao.

Maybe one day my children grow up to have their own pronouns or to agree with the idea, I wouldn't care. 

And that's what I'd like to emphasise, like I don't deny them using their own pronoun and identifying with it, they can do what ever the hell they want and I won't give them shit for it.

But when it comes to actually reffering to them in that way, I just can't do it. It just makes me feel weird, idk man."

>Right, pronouns are *gendered*. The definition has not changed. Gender has never been completely synonymous with sex. 

Gender describes sex. The fact that they are gendered does not mean you can just choose which one you like. Pronouns might be gendered, but they are still tied to sex. ""Men"" and ""women"" have always been identified by their biological sex, and their pronouns have always been determined by said biologically-determined sex.

another factor is probably that my boyfriend owned this reddit account before me, and he was raised hardcore republican (nowhere near as bad now as he was when we met) so i believed him and what he said about the sub when I asked about it.

I'm not sure how familiar you are with nonbinary identities, but nonbinary is a blanket term for identities that exist between male and female or don't map to a male/female spectrum of gender. I don't think I would say that gender necessarily comes from an established construct. I've heard from someone who uses xe/xir pronouns because xe doesn't identify with gender neutrality or with womanhood as it is constructed. Xe pronouns affirm both feminity and a nonbinary identity, at least that was my understanding. I can't really speak to the reason behind every set of pronouns someone uses, but I can accommodate their desire to use certain pronouns."

Plenty of non abusive men will and have defended themselves when women come at them with a flurry of fists or a weapon. Many people are advocating for equal rights in the eyes of the law, there’s many movements going on regarding child custody right now because men often get their children taken away from them for bad reasons. And many men are afraid to speak up against abuse or defend themselves in fear of bad actions from the law. ESPECIALLY men of color, in my personal experience.

I had this cousin growing up who would always yell ""I'm right! You're wrong! I'm right! You're wrong!"" while sticking his ears in his fingers the moment he ran out of anything of actual substance to say. This kind of reminds me of that.

>Claiming to be of another race is not the same as having gender dysphoria. 

But we weren't talking about gender dysphoria right now. You claimed that if I saw a regular trans guy, I would call that person ""sir"" as if convincingly looking like a man makes you a man. I just used this woman as a rebuttal. She looks rather convincingly like a black woman, but that has absolutely no baring on the fact that she's not actually black.

Sometimes surgeries and hormones are just too much, it's a lot to go through and takes a toll on your body. I never argued that ONLY your mental make up makes one that gender, either. You're just pushing that. I also argued transition, since that heavily changes your sex characteristics. At which point, you'd have a female body and mind (or opposite).

And i never said... Youre only a real trans person if you undergo surgery and hormones.... But go off. You're still really TRANS but you arguably probably still are BIOLOGICALLY MALE. But they still socially transitioned at the very least. My point of medical transition was to show that physically, they aren't biolically male anymore.

Also caitlyn literally underwent sex reassignment surgery and took hormones."

Then why does it matter if surgeries and hormones cost too much?

>OK so are you gonna pay for their transition? 

Why should I? You said you don't need surgery and hormone therapy to transition.

>Are you gonna house them if they get kicked out? 

What does that have to do with whether they're really a man or a woman?

>Are you gonna donate organs if they can't transition due to organ related weak immune systems? 

Do you need surgery and hormone therapy to transition or not? Because what you're saying here *strongly* implies that you absolutely need surgery to transition.

>Also caitlyn literally underwent sex reassignment surgery and took hormones. 

Yeah you'll notice that's why I used the word ""if"". *IF* Caitlyn Jenner did not undergo surgery or hormone therapy, would Caitlyn Jenner still be a man?"

And yes and no. It would honestly depend on how you view it. She socially transitioned and has gender dysphoria, so yes she's a woman. You could argue at that point she would still be partially biologically male, but even then, she would also be partially biologically female because of her brain. Gender is complicated, and youre trying to make it black and white which it isn't."
2731,2020-06-15 18:56:23,h9ffbr,"> It would honestly depend on how you view it.

2732,2020-06-15 18:56:50,h9ffbr,"OK but she *did* transition. Your question was if she *didn't* transition. So no. That doesn't settle it, she's a woman."

2734,2020-06-15 19:02:06,h9ffbr,"You define a woman as having female sex characteristics, right? Caitlyn has those, she had GRS  and HRT. So she's a woman by your definition. She at least isn't a man by your definition, that's for sure.

You keep turning things around and changing your argument. A second ago, this was about if she hadn't transitioned. Funny how that works with bigoted people, huh? Can't stick to one story to save their life.  You'll just try to find ways to hate and discriminate, regardless of how many times you've been disproven."
2735,2020-06-15 19:09:57,h9ffbr,">You define a woman as having female sex characteristics, right? Caitlyn has those, she had GRS and HRT.

Assuming Caitlyn actually had full gender reassignment surgery (which I don't think was ever confirmed but that's neither here nor there), the end result would be a mutilated penis that looks like a vagina. It would not be an actual vagina. So no, it does not fit my definition.

And I'm not asking you to explain my definition to me, I'm asking you to explain *your* definition. According to your definition, was Caitlyn a man up until she(?) had the surgery? Has Caitlyn always been a woman but only realized it later? When did Caitlyn become a woman?

>You keep turning things around and changing your argument.

Nope. Never did that. I'm very careful with what I say.

>A second ago, this was about if she hadn't transitioned.

Yes because I'm trying to figure out when someone becomes a woman under your worldview. Was Caitlyn born a woman but never knew it? Did Caitlyn only become a woman when she{?} decided that she's actually a woman? Did Caitlyn only become a woman once she{?} had the surgery? When did Caitlyn officially become a woman? Or was Caitlyn always a woman without realizing it until somewhat recently?"
2736,2020-06-15 19:11:42,h9ffbr,"OK quick question here, I get to ask something for once. Is someone with breasts, a vagina, and female hormones able to be a man, in your opinion?"
2737,2020-06-15 19:15:54,h9ffbr,">Is someone with breasts 

That depends on how you define ""breasts"". Does a fat guy have breasts? Do those count?

> a vagina 

That depends. Is it an actual vagina? Or does it just look like a vagina after surgery?

>and female hormones 

All men produce a certain amount of female hormones, so yes to this one."
2738,2020-06-15 19:17:49,h9ffbr,"OK let me rephrase that, female breasts that are the result of female hormones, a vagina or lack of a penis, and a larger amount of female hormones vs male hormones."
2739,2020-06-15 19:19:52,h9ffbr,"Yes I can see this as a man, but only in the case of hermaphroditism. But someone who is female in every single physical aspect except mentally is still a woman in my view."
2740,2020-06-15 19:22:11,h9ffbr,"OK then trans women arent men,cause they aren't hermaphrodites. Glad we cleared that up."
2741,2020-06-15 19:26:31,h9ffbr,"How in the fuck did you come to that conclusion from what I just said? I specifically said that I do not consider it a vagina if it was only made to look like a vagina after surgery.

But anyway, you are once again strongly suggesting that only post-op trans women are women. So your failed attempt at a gotcha moment really backfired there. I bet there are a whole lot of trans people out there who would call you transphobic for repeatedly insinuating that only post-op trans women are real women."

You're kind of done here because you can't remain consistent with your views and you realize you're digging your own grave. I still can't figure out if you view pre-op trans women as women or not. And frankly, I don't even know if you can figure that out either. You realize that if you say no, then you'll be considered just as transphobic and bigoted as you accuse me of being and if you say yes, you realize that half your arguments would go out the window because pre-op trans women don't have breasts, vaginas, or nearly enough female hormones.

2755,2020-06-15 07:21:45,h8cs3q,"Thank you so so much for this!!!

This should be pinned, maybe just for the month? because it's not getting many votes 🏳️‍🌈 and a lot of people might not see it!!"
2756,2020-06-15 11:00:10,h8cs3q,"Lots of great information thank you!

One thing I’d like to add is that we need to be nicer to Kendall. 

Everyone’s always waiting for her to come out as Lesbian and makes fun of her for it. It’s really not kind. If she is gay or bi who cares! Speculating aggressively about it seems insensitive and belittling."
2757,2020-06-15 14:09:24,h8cs3q,"I hadn’t heard the term dead naming before, so thanks for teaching me that. So much to learn always."

You're doing great, sweeties! 🧡🧡🧡"
2760,2020-06-13 18:33:59,h8cs3q,Thankyou for posting this - deadnaming is very offensive and can trigger people

2764,2020-06-13 10:36:50,h855jw,Don't know how much is truth and how much is just PR.  But Kendall and Caitlyn did always seem so close.
2765,2020-06-13 16:34:18,h855jw,huh.. i really thought they weren't speaking at the moment.. wonder how much of this is true.
2766,2020-06-13 18:11:45,h855jw,I do believe Kendall because I think they have a lot in common and she enjoys physical activity just as much. With Kylie though I smell bs. She's so flaky and there were a few episodes that showed Cait reaching out with very little reply. Maybe Cait is messaging her every day but I don't think Kylie returns that action.
2767,2020-06-13 16:59:17,h855jw,Kylie was at dinner with her the other night
2768,2020-06-15 13:20:30,h855jw,Ah cool! Thanks for the update. Since shes not on the show anymore i dont ever see caitlyn!

2785,2020-06-13 00:47:19,h7w0f0,"The CHAZ was not intentionally created.  Police violence was met with an unbelievably massive protestor response, which eventually became the zone.  Definitely something to be said for the irony of that.

2794,2020-06-13 19:49:50,h7w0f0,Those aren't necessarily two different things.
2795,2020-06-13 05:12:44,h7w0f0,"The point in trying to make is, why not have a bit more transparency towards the black community and ask if these actions (in general) are OK to act upon and if not then ask how can we be helpful."
2796,2020-06-13 00:04:24,h7w0f0,Isn’t the location due to the location of the east precinct?
2797,2020-06-13 00:02:52,h7w0f0,"I agree that there was a diverse crowd but that argument seemed to be a bit divisive to the black protestors I met. They said it tended to be just a small amount of black people (Yes, Seattle is mostly white) there who really only congregated with other black folks. Diversity Is great, but in this case it’s not about diversity, it’s about the black community and the support they want rather than the support we think they need. It’s wonderful there are people who can/want to help but I feel that based on the discussions I had and have seen we need to continue to ask the black community what they need from us and actually do it."
2798,2020-06-12 23:52:23,h7w0f0,If you took a few seconds to stop touching you’d probably be taken more seriously.
2799,2020-06-13 05:02:03,h7w0f0,"I never said there weren’t any there, I was there too. What I am saying though is that if you actually talked to the black folks there (in person, not just hear them on a PA) you’re going to hear from them what I reiterated in my post."
2800,2020-06-13 01:07:33,h7w0f0,"It's a percentage thing. Those 40,000 black people make up roughly 5% of the population. I get where your anger is coming from but I don't think this is the outlet. No matter how ""seen"" they are, 5% of a population is not a huge fraction. Not much point raging against numbers."
2801,2020-06-13 00:52:52,h7w0f0,I think you're being a little harsh...40k of 750k people isnt a ton.

2803,2020-06-13 01:33:38,h7w0f0,I dont think it matters if these protestors are black or white. They all want the same thing. Seattle just happens to be overwhelmingly White.
2804,2020-06-13 00:16:33,h7w0f0,So...a bunch of white people waiting around for the black leaders to negotiate with the mayor/city and decide on the next action? Its not like the white protestors abandoned the black protestors as they continued to march around the city the past couple days. Everyone is taking a breath of fresh air after a week of tear gas and we literally just had the biggest march yet

2810,2020-06-13 04:18:50,h7w0f0,"I am sorry for my contributions to the racist systems in our world, and for any pain that causes. But I hope those 40,000 people know they are not alone. There are many other people who will stand with them, and fight alongside them- regardless of skin color. It doesn't happen enough every day, but it is happening now. Keep hating on the racists though, there are a lot of real dicks out there."

2814,2020-06-13 05:05:50,h7w0f0,"This makes sense, I think it just needs to be addressed and said to the black community to see if this is what they want. Helping people in the way we think they need help isn’t helping them in the way they’re asking for help"

He survived being bitten for 20 years, being shotgunned in the head by thousands of hunters or bandits or military, being burnt by molotovs, being stabbed in the abdomen by a rusted rebar with possible sepsis/tetanus, being choked out of life by another hardened survivor.

Now that that's out of the way, here's stuff on some more queens, which again, some of it is valid, some is just stan Twitter exaggerating and asking for miniscule apologies again

Katya is cancelled for more than just being Trixie's friend, she lipsynced to the n word too 

And could Bob be considered CANCELLEDT for making a Holocaust joke about Jinkx? Which she actually defended with more than just ""it's just a joke at a roast lmfao"" (which is the more fitting response obviously), but with ""Tell me how anitisemitism from black people affects American today. . . I'll wait. . ."" If not let's CANCEL her for being friends with Bianca and Monet alone! Why not!? /s

Trixie was also at the same roast btw and she made the infamous slavery jokes about Latrice there, but I believe you covered it all with ""by being Trixie"" lmao 

Brooke Lynn is cancelled for posing with someone in blackface and just being Bianca del Rio's friend lol, which effectively cancels all queens, Shangela, Dela, Roxxxy Andrews, Detox, Mrs. Kasha Davis, Ongina, Courtney Act, you name it 

Willam, Charlie Hides, and April Carrion did blackface too. They did legit blackface. But now I'm seeing that Kim Chi's neon runway is also being considered semi blackface? Honestly I'm not black so I would like to know more from black people's POV about its appropriateness (or lack thereof), because frankly I didn't clock it as blackface when I saw the episode

Violet is cancelled for [being racist](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBvrWaJpK9w/?igshid=1oveioc31mtqv)

Also just in, Crystal Methyd is CANCELLEDT for posing with the confederate flag for satire lmao

Also Miz Cracker is cancelled for her name lol"

This is the result of taking subversive queer culture and going mainstream... you’re going to get lots of non cookie cutter gays. 

It’s almost like these RPDR fandom stan people are conservative right wingers dictating how queer people get to inhabit space.

Obviously, stuff like assault is inexcusable. Wish folks would just let these girls make their money and chill out, though. There’s literally kids starving in Yemen and bitches wanna pounce on someone for quoting a queer poet who used the word dyke.

And I can't believe how Yvie won, her fashion is very questionable. She says she is this odd queen, but that doesn't mean her looks needed to be this cheap. Like Sharon Needles, she was spooky and odd, but still fashion.

She is this kind of girl that will deliver you the harsh truth. But as she said in the reunion, maybe she just did it to be messy on a reality tv.

And i fell in love with Brooklyn Hytes. He seems a really nice and caring person. I can't believe his romance with Vanjie was real. Brooklyn is so hot out of drag and Vanjie looks like a Gremlin in and out of drag. And they just kept her until the end because of her romance with Brooklyn, she always delivered those ugly bodysuits.

Akeria was none existent except for the drama she instigated. We need to remember you for your talent mawma, not your drama.

And to conclude my season 11 rant, I liked Silky even though she was very annoying. Maybe because she was always fighting with Yvie and I hated her more. But she definitely deserved to be eliminated in her lipsync against Nina. MEH!"

3004,2020-07-06 06:47:21,him0o8,"I vaguely remember reading this too but I remember Serena piping up with supportive comments in Untucked. I think she said something like ""You should feel comfortable wearing girl clothes in the workroom"", and then in their Only Girl in the World lipsync she took Monica's hand at the end and bowed to her, gesturing to Monica as 'The only girl in the world'."
3005,2020-07-02 21:25:46,him0o8,Is this real? I'd fully didn't know this. Omg.
3006,2020-07-06 15:24:19,him0o8,Wouldnt that just .. cancel out the cancelling?
3007,2020-06-30 12:19:43,him0o8,How DARE you?!?
3008,2020-07-13 01:53:51,him0o8,I don't know about that but her comment on Sahara in response to Manila is what briefly got her cancelled
3009,2020-06-30 16:07:29,him0o8,Didn’t she also record herself having sex with a guy without his knowledge and posted it on her OnlyFans?
3010,2020-07-15 18:24:06,him0o8,She trying to feed Nina her feet

3020,2020-07-09 15:30:47,him0o8,"Realistically most of the cancelled comments come from like, a plethora of different age ranges and ethnic backgrounds which is why it's so scary. 15 year old white girls is a bit selective."
3021,2020-07-01 23:32:54,him0o8,Only by Ru
3022,2020-06-30 23:27:26,him0o8,Exactly. Sharon and Shitty Pie deserve to be “cancelled”. The rest are jokes about Stan Twitter
3023,2020-06-30 20:05:47,him0o8,"WHO cares that “people are getting turned off” by anyone! Get lost, you zoomer twat."
3024,2020-07-13 01:57:59,him0o8,"For real, I have some Drag Race mutuals and they DO take all of this seriously

And now they're cancelling Crystal for posing with the confederate flag for satire"
3025,2020-11-06 07:44:54,him0o8,lol yes that’s what we’re gonna cancel Sharon for.
3026,2020-07-12 00:58:13,him0o8,Of course they have lmao
3027,2020-11-05 21:52:30,him0o8,wait what who?

3032,2020-06-30 20:37:31,him0o8,Cancel Eddie Danger for gyrating on people in Hey Qween
3033,2020-07-13 01:59:59,him0o8,"I had to think really hard and Jaida, Bebe, and Shea probably qualify"
3034,2020-07-05 17:34:42,him0o8,Yeah. Listen to early episodes of What’s the Tee and she says all sorts of insane pseudoscience shit.
3035,2020-12-12 09:32:27,him0o8,And that is DISGUSTING. Gay males and nblm have no rights reclaiming this word
3036,2020-07-19 00:28:32,him0o8,A lot of younger generation take offense people weren't born 'woke'. I have been yelled at for admitting I used gay as a insult 2 decades ago. It's a weird world.
3037,2020-11-05 22:00:31,him0o8,"I totally agree. Cancel culture has never been about wanting people to learn from their mistakes. It’s always been about wanting to feel superior to them, or getting “woke” points. It’s funny that people even think these queens care about their opinions."
3038,2020-11-05 21:57:01,him0o8,It’s not.
3039,2020-06-30 12:58:43,him0o8,Omg it’s literally cause she spoke about doing weed in her insta  live and now she’s on the cancel train. But her name is Crystal Methyd... 🤷🏽‍♀️
3040,2020-06-30 12:59:50,him0o8,"I thought she was cancelled for even considering the other Snatch game choice she had. (The one Trixie is cancelled for performing as, which led to Transfat making a performance where she hit a Trixie doll with a walker. And led to anyone else who didn't speak out in support of Transfat as being ableist and cancelled.)... These things are getting hard to follow."
3041,2020-07-13 01:55:07,him0o8,It's because pics of her posing with the confederate flag 3 years ago have emerged. It was for a satire party making fun of the white trash people who actually believe in it.
3042,2020-07-13 02:03:21,him0o8,"I think it's obviously satire, that some fans think they're not just because they bring it up too much 

But no I don't think proof of it being otherwise exists"
3043,2020-07-11 08:47:04,him0o8,??? What nude???
3044,2020-11-05 21:57:18,him0o8,No one. That’s the point.
3045,2020-11-05 21:55:21,him0o8,It’s satire.
3046,2020-07-15 02:52:30,him0o8,"I definitely agree that roast jokes are not cancel-worthy, but that take/defense by Bob, if he really believes it, is more offensive and ridiculous than any joke could be.

 DeSean Jackson of Drag isn't a title you want."
3047,2020-07-02 16:08:51,him0o8,"Honestly I think putting the serious shit next to trivial crap just makes the serious stuff stand out more. The list at the top is what drag race Twitter is like at the moment, and it’s hard to figure out what’s actually going on among all of the “READ THE ROOM” tweets. I think saying it’s invalidating the genuine claims is a reach."
3048,2020-11-05 22:25:57,him0o8,"No. No. No. Jokes are not the same thing as actual HATE. They’re funny BECAUSE they’re so awful. Believe me, I used to feel the same way when I was a teenager (or however old you are, probably younger than me) but you know what happened? I grew up. You have to be able to joke about serious topics, you can’t let them have so much power over you. If you spend your entire life being offended by every little thing, you are going to be MISERABLE."
3049,2020-07-01 06:27:16,him0o8,"I know, it’s hilarious."
3050,2020-11-06 08:04:29,him0o8,The satire comes from comparing the mistakes made by the other queens to the crimes committed by Sharon & Sherry. That’s what makes this list funny.
3051,2020-06-30 17:02:56,him0o8,"I think you need to cancel YOURSELF lol

Edit: Have you noticed that almost every one of these hysterical twinks also posts in r/BeautyGuruChatter ?"
3052,2020-06-30 13:25:20,him0o8,This is satire. We’re poking fun.

3062,2020-07-01 02:59:46,him0o8,Add RuPaul lying to us like that every week to the reasons she's canceled
3063,2020-07-21 10:43:17,him0o8,has anyone he’s said that to actually even won...?
3064,2020-06-30 16:57:07,him0o8,He really does seem to think he’s The Main Judge.

3081,2020-06-30 19:30:41,him0o8,Didn’t she film a music video during the pandemic? Cancel Vanjie and Brooke too cause they broke up
3082,2020-06-30 12:31:07,him0o8,Yeah I still have sympathy for her condition even if I don't like her. Although I do wonder if somebody involved in her life is making sure she isn't hurting herself by performing constantly
3083,2020-06-30 15:50:22,him0o8,"She's also still crying about being called smelly, further incriminating Ra'jah who keeps getting sent vicious hate so she can fuck off."
3084,2020-07-03 01:33:16,him0o8,"Brooklyn came across as pretty cold to me.  Akeria was exquisite on her season.  Watch the season again and I think you'll appreciate her more.  Yvie was a bit ragged at times, but was fantastic at keeping her brand while doing countless runways.  Yvie slayed the last few episodes especially."
3085,2020-07-02 21:26:32,him0o8,I read it on Instagram years ago and never heard about it again so for all I know it was a lie lol

3092,2020-06-30 21:22:05,him0o8,if literally none of these things would make you like someone slightly less but my comment sets off this reaction from you...then idk what to tell you lol
3093,2020-12-12 10:04:33,him0o8,"Luckily the world is not black and white. If a lesbian is OK with someone using that to refer to them jokingly, then that’s their choice. Not yours"
3094,2020-06-30 15:20:07,him0o8,"Is that it? I saw some frantic teenage drag stans being like ""oh my god Crystal does drugs"" and I was already like... if that's a deal breaker there's probably like 20 queens to choose from who you can stan lmao"
3095,2020-06-30 14:09:44,him0o8,Haha omg the devil's lettuce
3096,2020-07-01 01:11:28,him0o8,"Yes, this is the ""situation"" she is being asked to ""address"". The Twitter teens are scandalized by her drug use and old thirst tweets (lol you are following a 29-year-old gay man who does drag), but the anger is over the... idea of playing Gypsy Rose Blanchard."
3097,2020-06-30 14:08:50,him0o8,Ah that would make sense! I haven't heard anything except people saying she's cancelled. Definatley getting too hard to keep up with
3098,2020-06-30 21:14:20,him0o8,Wait - what is Tricia cancelled for?
3099,2020-07-02 21:27:03,him0o8,Not when Trixie who is actively problematic is chocked up to “just being herself”
3100,2020-11-05 22:37:03,him0o8,This thread is 126 days old Megan I don’t care anymore
3101,2020-07-01 16:39:07,him0o8,"Screenshots can be altered. Are you seriously telling me I should believe an account that was set-up on June 2020 that is only following one person and the only one person they appear to be following is her. This account is a ""witness"" Really... Im not buying that bullshit. 

Thats an even stranger hill to die on but you do you. We've time and time again, when celebs have been accused on something which turns out to be false. James Charles for example."
3102,2020-06-30 15:59:31,him0o8,Yeah she’s cancelled for endangering people whilst drunk driving.
3103,2020-07-01 15:46:09,him0o8,"Yeah that's what threw me from satire to serious, some of these are really serious awful things to put next to jokes"
3104,2020-07-01 23:02:54,him0o8,"Yes I think that is very valid, but also part of the satire since the twitter stans seem to imply that everyone of these queens is just as bad as these 3 and deserve the same treatment"
3105,2020-07-23 00:49:29,him0o8,What’s the T on Sharon? I think I’ve been living under a rock...
3106,2020-06-30 15:13:04,him0o8,THE TIME HAS COME TO DELIMB AND DESTROY
3107,2020-06-30 15:25:42,him0o8,"That’s fair! Also, if there’s no credence, it’s probably best to avoid. Although, there are definitely similar accusations for other queens that are still on the sub lol"
3108,2020-07-24 01:21:20,him0o8,Did you also cancel valentina and the fans for racism against nina or do you just hate black queens that much to go as far as to accuse them of transphobia hmm
3109,2020-07-03 22:13:39,him0o8,"Ooh chile, it’s too horrendous to say. She even flicked the persons vagina afterwards"
3110,2020-07-09 17:14:52,him0o8,Oppalence
3111,2020-07-01 01:34:29,him0o8,"I didn’t see the colon mark in it! I got so scared like “what could anybody be mad at Jaida for?!”😂

Sorry!💛"
3112,2020-07-02 17:48:02,him0o8,I know it’s still early but this a top contender for my favorite comment of the day😂😂
3113,2020-07-03 04:12:20,him0o8,Yeah she lacks charisma. But it was the little things that she did that made me notice that she is a good person. Like asking Yvie to show her her moves and also when she let her piggyride her because of her ankle. That was the thing that won me about her.
3114,2020-07-02 21:34:11,him0o8,"Oh, yeah. It must be a lie. Thanks!"
3115,2020-07-13 02:56:05,him0o8,"It's about 2 things: 

1) A 3 year old picture of the Get Dusted girls dressed as ""white trash"" stereotypes in front of a confederate flag has surfaced. Of course now people on Twitter are saying that she and her friends support the confederate flag. It's obvious that they were not actually supporting the confederate flag, but rather mocking it and its supporters. 

2) And even _thinking_ of doing Gypsy Rose Blanchard for Snatch Game, so she's ableist

You're welcome :)"
3116,2020-06-30 21:38:17,him0o8,"It’s alright, I don’t need you to tell me anything. You’re a teenager lol.

Don’t you have anything better to do than call queens problematic?"
3117,2020-12-12 11:05:52,him0o8,You can't ask every single lesbian if the world if they are okay with you using slurs men have been using against them for ages! So please if you're a male/not lesbian in general please don't use slurs! You have your own slurs to reclaim
3118,2020-06-30 14:54:32,him0o8,Cancel Laganja!

3124,2020-07-09 19:51:12,him0o8,Is she even a drag queen still? I thought she quit
3125,2020-07-01 21:44:14,him0o8,That's what makes it satire.
3126,2020-06-30 15:40:23,him0o8,"Yeah and I should also mention none of these are necessarily things I think queens should be canceled for, just looking at stuff that reddit flipped over in the past (and mostly forgot about) or jokes! Jokes jokes jokes ^jokes."
3127,2020-11-20 20:12:16,him0o8,"lol I’ve heard people say the same thing about a few queens. They’re trolls, don’t believe them."

In fact you seem to be the one ready to jump down people's throats for literally nothing. Unless you're just a kid trying to be immature online for fun? I won't engage further.
3131,2020-12-12 11:06:52,him0o8,How me and my lesbian friends communicate with each other is none of your damn business

3134,2020-07-02 16:51:20,him0o8,"This is very poorly worded. A twitter account made the same month and only following one person doesnt seem legit.. to me anyway. I will awaite to her (Sharon's) response to hear the otherside of the story. 

Maybe 14 year old twitter stans will believe that but I wont."

3139,2020-07-02 18:33:22,him0o8,"I’m being serious. How old would my friend’s account need to be? How many people do they need to follow?
If I asked my friend to help back up my account of being sexually assaulted, so they made a twitter account to do so, how long after making their account should they wait? Should they be active for a while first?
What do you personally need in order to believe their account, given you’re waiting for Sharon’s side? You’ve already decided you don’t believe it."
3140,2020-07-04 02:25:38,him0o8,"no satire is when you muddy your point by purposefully obfuscating what you're saying don't you know the classic quote about satire:

""Satire *doesn't* require~~s~~ a clarity of purpose and target lest it be mistaken for and contribute to that which it intends to criticize""

god read a ~~book~~ twitter thread sweaty"
3141,2020-07-03 22:13:55,him0o8,Idiot
3142,2020-07-01 02:13:02,him0o8,You sound old and very bitter lol
3143,2020-12-12 12:07:42,him0o8,No
3144,2020-07-02 23:34:47,him0o8,K well you’re not everyone
3145,2020-07-02 22:06:38,him0o8,"Twitter is such a huge platform, I would find it incredibly unrealistic that someone who has been to see the queens on tour and taken pictures with Michelle Visage would not have a twitter account. I dont believe a twitter account that appears in the same month as allegations appear, has a little following is real. I am sorry. That is very off, if you want to do believe then you do you. 

""Oh yes in the middle of someone making ALLEGATIONS, a mystery account appears with no following to back it up"" Im sorry that line of logic isnt working for me. 

Sharon has every right just like Alaska and Michelle to rebut these allegations. If their false then an innocent man has been smeared on the internet (which has happened before). If not then Sharon should face the consquences."
3146,2020-07-18 17:58:31,him0o8,"I don’t know if you purposely said sweaty instead of sweety but I’m honestly living for it.
Edit: typo hahaha"
3147,2020-07-01 02:22:14,him0o8,"Lmao. You sound like a boring, uptight kid that needs to read more and type less."
3148,2020-07-02 23:41:10,him0o8,Insert gif of Lucille Bluthe rolling her eyes here
3149,2020-07-02 23:03:01,him0o8,Got it. You side with the famous one.
3150,2020-07-02 11:02:01,him0o8,Your time left on this earth is too short to be this mad take a yoga class at the old folk home and have a pudding cup
3151,2020-07-01 02:25:23,him0o8,Ohhh the projection is strong here!! 🤡🤡🤡
3152,2020-07-02 23:40:41,him0o8,"Do you under what the term ""face the consequences"" means???"
3153,2020-07-01 06:44:14,him0o8,"Honestly... wow. I’m sure you can say similar things about mine, but your post history is maybe the most toxic I’ve ever seen on Reddit. Literally all you do is call people names, cuss people out, spit poison at Americans, and criticize. I thought I was bad, but you are WAY worse.

Clearly this is a vent account for you to express anger. I should know - I do it too. You just do it WAY more than me. Maybe pick up some other hobby to get your energy out other than tearing people down online. You’ve inspired me to do the same."
3154,2020-07-02 23:42:24,him0o8,Do you think wealthy people with loyal fanbases often “face the consequences”?
3155,2020-07-01 06:45:54,him0o8,That's alot of emotion
3156,2020-07-02 23:43:49,him0o8,"They should, if their guilty of wrong doing. However, their is two sides to this story innocent till proven guilt."
3157,2020-07-02 23:54:22,him0o8,"I didn’t say should they, I said do they. Abuse/assault/rape can be nigh impossible to prove, and even when you do there’s no guarantee the abuser will receive an actual punishment. Look at Brock Turner. The SheMZ challenge lasted longer than he was in jail."
3158,2020-07-03 00:14:56,him0o8,"Women or Men who are raped struggle to come forward due to people who make up fake reports. Do you realise how to intensifies a true victims struggles?. Its not impossible to prove rape, its allowing victims to come forward without fear of being ridiculed. I am sorry I dont believe in a note pad, account on twitter. Or random twitter accounts thay pop up to ""back her up"" we've seen this happen before.

Ill always stand by the victims and even I could see the BS in her evidence. Its the James Charles effect in full swing. I've seen Sharon compared to Sherry Pie, the difference between Sherry and Sharon is that Sherry admitted to her abuse where as Sharon is going to deal with it. 

Btw Brock Turner's sentence was white privilege in action."
3159,2020-07-03 00:25:27,him0o8,"I didn’t come forward when I was raped because of fear I wouldn’t be believed “without proof”, and not the estimates 8% false rape claim. 

Brock Turner was both white privilege and rich privilege."
3160,2020-07-03 00:32:07,him0o8,Where did you pull thay statistic from... again I am not believing a note pad accusations on twitter with very sketchy evidence. Its estimated by MET that over 63 percent of rapes aren't reported. Huge proportion of this is due to stigma.
3161,2020-07-03 09:37:28,him0o8,"It’s an FBI statistic. In the UK it’s a lot lower, around 3%. 

You’re so close to getting it with your last sentence."
3162,2020-07-03 09:55:36,him0o8,Yes stigma caused by those who falsely report abuse.
3163,2020-07-03 10:13:45,him0o8,Just so close.
3164,2020-06-30 12:43:11,hik9ba,"""When I grew up my family was so poor we didn't have a pot to piss in so we pissed in other people's pots. We'd break into houses in the dead of night, find people's pots, and take a giant piss in them"".

This one always cracked me the fuck up. Something about the phrase ""take a giant piss"" just hits me right. The joke goes on, but the ""giant piss"" is the highlight for me."
3165,2020-06-30 15:00:16,hik9ba,"Good, bring that up"
3166,2020-06-30 15:46:06,hik9ba,People like the hader episode a lot more than i imagined.
3167,2020-06-30 09:48:18,hik9ba,"""We were talking about 'easy as pie'. You know what's not easy as pie? Baking a fuckin' actual pie!""

""I know the Bible says not to covet thy neighbour's wife. But it doesn't say a damn thing about coveting thy neighbour's husband. Especially his hot, sweet fuckin' asshole.""

Sad to see this one go. Joke segment is top notch.

Going Letterman next I think. Listened to half of yesterday and thought it was a bit slow."
3168,2020-06-30 10:34:26,hik9ba,"Candyman, the Mask. Alleged Rapist, occasionally funny lady that doesn't know how to wipe, Juicy Tits, who?, and Dom Irrera! 

sounds like my honeymoon."
3169,2020-06-30 15:45:38,hik9ba,"Hey man, i was rewatching the carvey episode and it's a lot funnier than i remembered. The kirk douglas/burt lancaster bit is awesome, his hitchcock impression saying ""not exactly, tippay"" was hilarious and the joke segment was pretty solid, ending on that steven wright joke. 

Voted for letterman this time."
3170,2020-07-01 03:06:22,hik9ba,"Hader might be my favorite episode of the podcast.

Hader is one of my favorite actors and he and Norm just kicked back and told stories for awhile. They kept it funny, but let the stories tell the jokes. Norm didn't need to derail. In fact, Norm was unusually engaged.

Not that the fans mind Norm derailing."

3175,2020-06-29 17:57:09,hi2o22,That’s right cummy 😍😍😍
3176,2020-06-29 16:08:48,hi2o22,"Well, I was shopping in Walmart the other day, (with the intent of buying all of their guns, bacon and American flags) when I spotted a Mooslem running frantically up and down through the aisles, and his name was Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul. I was certain at any moment he would yell 'Allah Akbar'. Thankfully, my shopping cart was full of bacon (which as you all know, is Mooslem kryptonite). So I straightened my MAGA hat and pulled up my Confederate flag britches and grabbed a pack of bacon from my cart. I took that Mooslem over my knee and spanked his ass with the bacon while screaming 'Liberalism is a mental disorder!' over and over. Then, by the power of the bacon,  Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul instantly converted to Christianity and registered as a Republican. Trump showed up and awarded me the Medal of Honor because I probably stopped the next 9/11.

Me wen somone says molester trucks is better than Dio saurs:

What the fuck did you just fucking say to me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ""clever"" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.

Me when I see 420 and funny secks number (420): WOW kid you just got R/WOOOOOOSHED!!!! 😂😂👀

""Wooosh"" means you didn't get the joke, as in the sound made when the joke ""woooshes"" over your head. I bet you're too stupid to get it, IDIOT!! 😤😤😂

My joke was so thoughtfully crafted and took me a total of 3 minutes, you SHOULD be laughing. 🤬 What's that? My joke is bad? I think that's just because you failed. I outsmarted you, nitwit.🤭

In conclusion, I am posting this to the community known as ""R/Wooooosh"" to claim my internet points in your embarrassment 😏. Imbecile. The Germans refer to this action as ""Schadenfreude,"" which means ""harm-joy"" 😬😲. WOW! 🤪 Another reference I had to explain to you. 🤦‍♂️🤭 I am going to cease this conversation for I do not converse with simple minded persons.😏😂

Me when 420: nice

Nobody: nice

Not even a single soul: bruh moment life so brody can see

Single soul be like: Am i a joke to you????

Soul: Youtube recommendation be like: 2019: no 2020: YES!!!!!!!!1!1!11!ONEONE111!1!1!1!ONEONEONE!!!!11!ONE!!1!1!1!!!!1!

Nobody: The phrase “it’s just a game” is such a weak mindset. You are ok with what happened, losing, imperfection of a craft. When you stop getting angry after losing, you’ve lost twice.

There’s always something to learn, and always room for improvement, never settle.

Welcome to Team Fortress 2. After nine years in development, hopefully it will have been worth the wait. To listen to a commentary node, put your crosshair over the floating commentary symbol and press your primary fire. To stop a commentary node, put your crosshair over the rotating node and press your primary fire again. Some commentary nodes may take control of the game in order to show something to you. In these cases, simply press your primary fire again to stop the commentary. In addition, your secondary fire will cycle you through all the commentary nodes in the level. Please let me know what you think after you have had a chance to play. I can be reached at gaben@valvesoftware.com, and my favorite class is the Spy. Thanks, and have fun!

The Declasse Vamos is now available in southernsanandreassuperautos.com

Season X is here, and the world is destabilising, fast. But, don’t worry, that means there are a ton of new ways to play Fortnite! From the B.R.U.T.E., a new 2 player vehicle that packs some serious fire power, to mysterious Rift Zones that alter your favourite POIs in unexpected ways. Huh, that's weird. Season X delivers new experiences for all players to enjoy. There are new places to explore, new secrets to uncover, and the world you play today, may not be the world you play tomorrow. In addition to all new gameplay found in Season X, there's also a brand new Battle Pass, that'll introduce new 'dimensions' to some of your favourite Fortnite characters in ways you've never seen before. And at Tier 100, you'll unlock Ultima Knight. Plus, don't forget, there are new emotes, gliders, wraps and more to earn as you advance through the pass. The Battle Pass is available right now, for just 950 Vbucks! We'll see you ingame.

There was the typical ""all it takes to be a woman is to say you are one, how absurd!"" type conversation a couple times, of course. Also various jokes about how one worker having his wife's purse on his desk made him look gay, just generally being jokingly insulting about the tiniest non-stereotypically-manly things. One former unpleasant male co-worker from a different department was brought up, and the fact that he had kind of a hippie aesthetic and wore a skirt to work was mentioned as a reason why he was weird and shouldn't be taken seriously. Like, if he really was a jerk, I don't see what him wearing a skirt had to do with it.

It just generally made me hugely uncomfortable. I didn't feel like I was going to be respected once I finally came out, because I was overhearing people point-blank talking about how both trans people and even slightly gender-nonconforming people were dumb and shouldn't be respected. 'Course, it ended up not being something I had to confront because I got fired before I came out. Mainly because even though I wasn't out as a trans woman, I was still definitely not a stereotypically manly man in my personality or resilience to abuse, and did _not_ thrive in an environment where non-conformity to male social expectations was tolerated."

You could be thinking about celebrities being called out, or people being fired, being publicly shamed, or, I like to add, simply being shunned by your own friends, and a host of other behaviors. 

It's possible that some of these are overblown, while others are not. Unless we specify what cancel culture means, or we separate these behaviors to discuss them independently, it will be very difficult to have a productive conversation."

3261,2020-08-18 21:36:05,ic5y6z,"I will push back a bit on the wrongness of canceling someone.  


The first case, a company fires someone, cancels its ads on some show, changes its brand name, etc.  These entities are in the business of making money.  They are making decisions on what they feel will result in the most profit (or the least diminution of profit).  They make these decisions every day.  If the decision results in the wrong outcome, they would change again.

For this reason, I don't get too worked up over what a commercial enterprise does.  They are free to run the company (within the law) and they answer to their shareholders.  If enough people disagree with their decisions, the stock goes down and they change back.

The instances of companies having to reverse course on a 'cancel culture' decision seem pretty rare so their weather vanes must be correct.

&#x200B;

The second case is an individual canceling/unfriending/etc. someone whose views they feel are cancel-worthy.  In that case, again, I feel that a person's right to associate/patronize/etc. someone is their own.  And just like in the case of the company above, if the person doing the canceling finds themselves alone in the world due to their intolerance, I imagine they would change/evolve.

&#x200B;

Where I do draw a line is in the idea that people should be free from having to hear things or that any topic is off-limits.  People should be absolutely free to discuss any topic they like (which they are).  They are just not entitled to perpetual employment regardless of their opinions."
3262,2020-08-18 19:35:53,ic5y6z,"I agree with your assessment and I’m a little surprised by how many people seem to think this is just something concocted by the right or even that it doesn’t exist at all.  We should take in to account what people are being cancelled for. 

In the case you mentioned this person was canceled or almost cancelled by their own peers for writing a scholarly article.  The fact that her own peers did it is significant and the reasons for their attempted cancellation don’t seem justified.  

The last thing that’s significant is that it’s impossible to criticize them.  For the author to take a stance of disagreement with a black woman is apparently not allowed as the author is forced to site them to have any kind of credibility.  Any disagreement and the criticism would be “you don’t know what it’s like” or “they studied race theory and you didn’t”."

Why does America have to get dragged into each fucking century amidst a culture war?

You haven’t even figured out as a society how you feel about abortion yet and you want to spend years of focus, dozens of podcasts and all the air in every room talking about something that you’ve been doing for my entire life, my fathers entire life and my grandfathers entire life.

People losing their lives, their homes, their jobs, their safety.

If it showed ""what's going to happen,"" then it showed that people will get mad at you and call you mean names if you say something they don't like. That's a tale as old as time. But it also showed that the institution will stay strong and level heads will prevail. As with the more recent Steven Pinker incident, if you're concerned about cancel culture, I don't see how you can count this as anything but a win. 

Not to be flip, but what sort of cultural equilibrium are you looking for here? That you will make arguments or statements that challenge people's deeply held beliefs, in ways that many people perceive as attacks on their very identities, in a world where all 7 billion of us have an internet-sized megaphone, and that there won't be some kind of backlash? Like... have you met human beings?

Or do we say ""Okay, people got mad, they expressed that anger, no one got hurt or fired or had rotten vegetables thrown at them in the town square: this looks like about as healthy a process as we can hope for in the present environment.

It’s not that I don’t think the issue is a problem, or even a big problem, but there are much more egregious examples.

When a community finds moral fault with an argument and the people who making it they will show that anger by protesting, boycotting, refusing to host their speech and so on. This happens across the political spectrum and throughout our history so this idea of ""moral panic"" or cancel-culture is a new name for a phenomenon as old as human history. It's a flimsy cover for a purely emotional argument against the left motivated by the very real loss of power being felt by white evangelicals.

Trump and Republicans have constantly tried to cancel people over the last 30 years.  Trump even used the white house to call for a sports broadcaster to be fired over a tweet.

It’s kind of hard for people on the left to claim the moral high ground and throw around insults like “hateful” and “evil” to the other side when the people issuing those insults engage in the behaviors associated with “cancel culture.” It’s essentially bullying. And in a country where your healthcare and housing are effectively tied to your job, “call his / her employer and get him / her fired” is an extremely cruel sanction to adopt as the “one size fits all” punishment for wrongthink"

When someone trends for saying or doing something stupid there is no way to tell the whole world they can't have an opinion about it.  

A recent example of this is Terry Crews criticizing black lives matter and then in turn trending on twitter with lots of people criticizing him.  Conservatives then came out and said ""they are trying to cancel Terry Crews.""  The reality is he said a public statement that many didn't like and then got criticized for it.  That is often what is described as cancel culture.  Somebody gives an opinion and people respond to that opinion and then others say that person is being cancelled.

It doesnt actually take that much digging into reality to realize the flaws here. Similarly a large issue with trans persons is reality: As far as we can tell having a mis-matched gender identity is a thing that we can see pretty reliably, and dealing with gender identity in this manner causes the most people to live happy normal lives.

Do people, in large quantities \*actually\* identify as ""transracial"" or is it \*actually\* more likely to be related to mental illness? One look at Rachel Dolazel's wikipedia page suggests, I mean, there's ""a lot"" going on with this woman. And I'm frankly not aware of another example.

Michelle Wolff you could say lost her job because of poor ratings which is fair, but there were conservatives going apeshit at Netflix about her and saying to boycott her show.  If Dave Chappelle getting a few bad reviews is considered cancel culture, how conservatives acted towards Wolff after the correspondence dinner would fit into the category.  There wer far worse things said about her and far more calls for her to be boycotted than there were from liberals about Chappelle.  Most of Chappelle's fanbase are on the left."

Most people want secure borders. The disagreement generally comes on how many people we should allow and how we should vet them.

For the woke crowd however the idea of open borders was common and pushed for. This idea made its way to members of the democratic party. 

So you had certain democrats pushing ideas that almost everyone disagrees with and that were almost certainly somewhat because of woke influence.

Or that Biden didn’t just say he would pick the best running-mate, he said he would pick the best female POC running-mate. That it doesn’t even occur to Biden that he’s being discriminatory adds to the general sense that the Democratic Party is the party of urban, educated elites who prefer to obsess over every minority grievance no matter how small, at the expense of the bulk of Americans and their problems. Bathroom issues affect the 0.5% of Americans who identify as trans. Deindustrialization of the heartland affects 40% of Americans. How much lip-service do the urban elites dedicate to the former over the latter? 

Every NPR news hour has at least 20% of news items dedicated to some kind of grievance issue - an oppressed female scientist; a ballet that has two men dance together; that it must be racism if black people suffer disproportionately from COVID; a Hollywood starlet whose million Dollar contract was 20% less than her male costar. Et etc. All perfectly interesting news items, but all very particular to the urban, educated, elites with their ever evolving and arcane language codes, special sensitivities, and intolerance for anyone who violates these fault lines.

Cancel Culture is when an internet mob tries to threaten someone's livelihood which is just obviously different than otherwise normal harsh criticism!"" and then all the jamokes pat each other on the back ""oh yes, yes that's the definition mhmm""

This right here was an example of someone receiving very harsh criticism from their peers and had one piece of writing un-supported. That's not having your job or livelihood threatened.

1. Transgenderism makes the most sense in a weak gender essentialist framework, or you may call it a sociobiological constructivist one or whatever. Often dumbed down as ""born in the wrong body"".
2. Race may be considered a socially constructed concept, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have biological aspects to it. Isn't that pretty obvious? The biological aspect we all know, and the social aspect is why Obama is black even though his ancestry is equal parts European; because he's coded as such in American society. In some other countries he'd been considered mixed.
3. The biological aspect of race may not be sufficient, but it's currently a necessary condition in American society. As in, if you don't have significant African ancestry, you are not black, period. This isn't some ontological matter, it's just a cultural thing. So you *could* have a different ""definition"" of what being black meant, but this is the one people operate under at present.
4. Since transgenderism in my opinion best ought to be viewed as a mismatch between some aspects of the brain (which is subject to sexual dimorphism just like other organs) and the rest of the body (think gender identity = internal model of your sex, like sexual proprioception), and race is clearly a social construct that has biological aspects to it, there need not be any inconsistency between rejecting transracialism and affirming transgenderism.

In 2012, the GOP nominated literally the guy who fired people. 

After 2012, Trayvon Martin happened and so did BLM, and most importantly, Obama said, ""Trayvon could've been my son."" There are studies out there that showed that time period showed a drop in support from future Obama-Trump voters, because up until that time, Obama has been one of the Good Ones. 

Then, in 2016, the GOP nominated the most famous person to become the nominee since Eisenhower, who has been positively portrayed in media as a successful businessman since the 80's, and they went up against a woman who'd been painted as an evil shrill bitch for the past 30 years by both people who hated her on the Left & Right. 

I think it is also important to note that in 2018, a decent chunk, (1/3 to 1/2) of Obama-Trump voters came back to the Democrat's, because they did get fooled by the trade and jobs talk, only to see Trump focus on immigration and banning Muslim's."

It is analogous to signal violence. Let's say I don't like it when Bulgarians study mathematics at my university. I get together with my friends and we try to kill the most prominent Bulgarian student of mathematics in order to send a message to other Bulgarians to stay out of math. We fail to kill him, instead he gets a mild beating and university security services stop us from killing him.

The signal that we wished to send still got sent. Bulgarian mathematics students may take some comfort in the fact that we failed to kill him, but they'll also recognise that the security services might not be there for them when the anti-Bulgarian target falls on their backs.  Maybe some of them will even transfer to chemistry.

It's a good thing that the anti-Bulgarians-in-mathematics violence failed. It's a ""win"" in that regard, but the message was still sent, and it still had an effect. If the security services' ability to intervene seemed like a rare fluke (like having a publisher with a spine), then the message is hardly even diminished, since the other Bulgarian math students cannot expect to be safe from the next attack.

Anger is fine, but describing this as getting angry is a bit like describing a drive-by-shooting as ""aggressive driving.""

2) No. One key actor said that. 800 academics said the opposite. The journal editors said the opposite. This very nearly went the other way.

Will copy and paste what I said in another comment here:

>Jon Ronson was not exactly writing about cancel culture in the same terms as people like Harris, who are mostly criticizing what they call ""woke"" liberals or the ""far-left."" He was unpacking a form of social media mobbing, where situations become decontextualized from the human beings at their centre, and where the incentive structures of platforms like Twitter encourage a kind of mass sharing that either exponentially increases the effects of bullying, or just by volume becomes a form of bullying in itself. This can happen with anything and anyone and frequently does, and sometimes it's right-wing and sometimes it's left-wing, and sometimes it's intentionally targeted and sometimes it's sort of just naturally occurring.  
>  
>It's clearly a troubling facet of our social and media landscape, but it is one we all share in and should be confronting together. Instead, the complaints of Harris and others focuses on the historically voiceless finally finding in these platforms a way to actually express their voice and with it a form of power in numbers that while still troubling in a certain respect for the above reasons, should not be so simply villainized. Rather than tell a story of ""The Left Gone Mad"", we should be telling a story of social media incentives at once making public speech more accessible and more amenable to collective action—which is excellent for democracy—while also making the public sphere more prone to pile-ons, decontextualization, lack of charity, etc.—which is bad for democracy.  
>  
>Where I would put my focus is on creating platforms that at once allow for those positive qualities, while disincentivizing the negative ones, creating a public sphere where those historically marginalized voices do have more access to the podium and more ability to act collectively to exert power and influence, particularly in opposition to monied interests, without the needless cruelty of the online mob. The risk in that is that online fascists would also have access to the podium in that scenario, but then again, they already do."

3440,2020-08-19 01:07:51,ic5y6z,"In my view the biological aspects of race (such as they even exist) are not meaningful to the topic of transracialism, which at the moment entirely revolves around arguments of black American cultural appropriation/presentation/deception.  It's interesting you say if you don't have African ancestry you're not black.  This really isn't the case as far as how people will treat you, i.e. having an ""authentic"" black life experience.  I mean there's even a lot of guff that rich or ""white
""-speaking black people get, with others in the black community claiming they're not truly experiencing life as a real ""black"" person.  Anyway, people assume race based purely upon skin color followed by other outward presentations.  In other words, it's really not that hard to pass as a different race if you want to.  Nobody can confirm anyones ancestry at any given moment, and you never need to confirm it throughout your entire life.  Though my point is this: transracial people are, most of the time, talking about a cultural identification that is specific to a race.  And even with the 'from Africa' demand, all humans evolved out from Africa so we'd have to start adding specific timelines onto stuff if we take a broad enough view.  It might sound like a silly claim, but the ""from Africa"" part only remains relevant in context of modern American culture to begin with, significantly narrowing the scope of what could be a broader view on transracialism.

As for how this connects to transgenderism, it's tricky.  Are those who are trans drawn to the cultural appeal of how a gender presents?  Are they drawn to the biological change of sexual equipment?  Or both?  And do these draws change based on the age of the trans-curious person (i.e. I can't imagine a pre-pubescent person caring about sexual equipment changes in an authentic way)?  Can a person become more or less desiring of this feeling over time?  This wide variation in what now represents ""transgender"" doesn't let any clean arguments be made.  If it's the cultural norms around gender the drive transgenderism, then transracialism becomes valid so long as the transracial person finds the other race-specific culture authentically more appealing.  Being able to pass authentically within that culture also silences any argument that the person isn't authentically experiencing the cultural norms of being that specific race (i.e. Rachel Dolezol vs a white person who grew up surrounded in black culture but doesn't feel the need to identify as the other race.  Are there men who adopt all the cultural norms of women but have no desire for the sex change?  Are they called trans or not?  Same confusing situation here).  Regardless, even if most or all transgender people also desire the sex change, that doesn't demand transracial people need also desire the biological change to authentically desire a different cultural presentation unique to a specific race.

And even if it does demand a biological change to be truly transracial, one could assume that in some sophisticated futuristic time, you can genetically manipulate supposedly ""racial"" variables to match whatever you want.

I'm also fairly skeptical that the current trans community would affirm something along the lines of a biological test to determine if one is ""truly""  trans by limiting it to the results of a dimorphism test or etc."

There is also plenty of cancel culture that comes from Trump and conservatives.  

An interesting example of someone being cancelled is Reza Aslan.

But then Nixon and Reagan stole away the Dixiecrats and the religious conservatives, pulling with them blue collar rural folks with pickup trucks and country music. The unions collapsed so workers didn’t have union reps telling them to vote democratic. The Dems became the party of minorities, trial lawyers, Jews, urbanites, Hollywood, and 99% of academics.

First, I'll just say that my framing wasn't intended to minimize the extent of the mob's actions or the consequences they had on the author (or to anyone else as part of the above mentioned signalling). 

I think the problem I'm having with these analogies is that you're comparing this to things which involve organized, intentional violence where the ethical (and legal!) wrong is unambiguous for any knowingly involved parties: whether you're driving or shooting, you know you're in a driveby that is intended to kill someone.

I don't know that the same follows for 'cancel culture,' because the phenomenon we're talking about is one that involves actions and behaviors that are not just justified, but laudatory in a wide variety of circumstances. I mean this both from the perspective of the culpability of individual participants, but maybe even more importantly because I think it's central to the discussion of what kind of online culture we actually want to have.

I think that sort of stuff is *fundamental* to the absolute bedrocks of civic life: not just at the level of personal freedoms (expression, association), but in the sense that I don't think that a democratic society could function without those mechanisms. Do I think people were right to do what they did in this particular case? Well, that depends on which people and which actions we're talking about. I've taken your #gamergate comparison to heart, and I understand the notion that we have to consider the actions of the mob as a whole. But I just don't see a way to solve that gordian knot without talking about specific cases and specific actions. Maybe it's just the historian in me. =) 

In this particular case, I'm by no means an expert in analytic philosophy, but to my lay reading of the article and some of the responses, it certainly seems *very plausible* that the arguments presented deserved criticism, up to and including saying snarky shit on twitter. I'm *doubtful* that the article should have been recalled, so I think the letter signatories were probably wrong, but frankly I'm so ignorant of the subject matter that I wouldn't be able to argue the case with any of them. It seems to me *almost certain* that the associate editors behaved inappropriately in releasing a separate statement condemning the article, without going through the regular processes. And anyone going after her job or her personal life -- not just the article -- can *definitely* go die in a fire. As far as I can tell, the framing of 'cancel culture' asks me to throw all this into a blender and wag my finger at the whole 'mob,' even though I probably couldn't tell a significant fraction of them what it was they had done wrong.

Which leaves me wondering what the 'cancel culture' conversation is about, then? Is it meant to signal that the responses in this or that specific case weren't proportional? That technology has interrupted some kind of equilibrium of action and response? Is it about a general cultural trend toward 'over reactions'? Is it about specific topics where the grounds of acceptable discourse have shifted (sometimes quite rapidly)? Is it about specific modes of action (calling someone's boss or doxxing them) that should be forbidden altogether? Or is it just a descriptor of the era, an effort to convey a kind of generally repressive miasma or a zeitgeist of some kind? I'm not throwing this at you as an accusation of vagueness; I'm genuinely trying to understand the *utility* of the term among its proponents.

>I can all but guarantee that denying it exists, or pretending it's a  confection of right-wing media will make solving it impossible 

I do think it's fair to say that the term 'cancel culture,' in its most frequent incarnations, has a partisan valence. I'm not saying that this is consciously cynical in all cases, and based on past discussions I genuinely don't think *you* use it in this way, but more often than not it circulates with a connotation that 'wokeness run amok' is the main culprit here.

Rather than tell a story of ""The Left Gone Mad"", we should be telling a story of social media incentives at once making public speech more accessible and more amenable to collective action—which is excellent for democracy—while also making the public sphere more prone to pile-ons, decontextualization, lack of charity, etc.—which is bad for democracy.

Where I would put my focus is on creating platforms that at once allow for those positive qualities, while disincentivizing the negative ones, creating a public sphere where those historically marginalized voices do have more access to the podium and more ability to act collectively to exert power and influence, particularly in opposition to monied interests, without the needless cruelty of the online mob.

3471,2020-08-19 11:08:01,ic5y6z,"Working so can't spend too much time on my reply:

>*In my view the biological aspects of race (such as they even exist) are not meaningful to the topic of transracialism*

I disagree. I don't think you can make sense of why transracialism feels like a kind of cheating to most people without the biological aspect. The reasoning around rich black people is a discussion about sufficient conditions, not necessary ones as far as I can tell.

>Anyway, people assume race based purely upon skin color followed by other outward presentations.

People may **assume** race by phenotypic presentation, but they also reject that assumption if they find out ""you aint black"". That's why being black can't simply be about presentation, there is an involuntary component to it. That's why I said it's a necessary (but maybe not sufficient) condition to have african ancestry. It's not that it's impossible to **fake it** in the sense that people will assume you're black with enough effort, but that's the difference between assuming things **based on** phenotypic presentation and **identifying** a category on phenotypic presentation alone (if you look black you're black vs if you look black you most likely have african ancestry, and so you're black. But if I find out you're actually an indian guy trying to get into a university of your choice, I rescind my categorization). Re ancestry and ""out of africa"", yes and maybe all species on earth have a common ancestor and yet a monkey is not a fish.

There are fuzzy borders no doubt, there almost always is in language, but fuzzy borders doesn't mean the category is bunk.

>Are those who are trans drawn to the cultural appeal of how a gender presents? Are they drawn to the biological change of sexual equipment? Or both? And do these draws change based on the age of the trans-curious person (i.e. I can't imagine a pre-pubescent person caring about sexual equipment changes in an authentic way)? Can a person become more or less desiring of this feeling over time? This wide variation in what now represents ""transgender"" doesn't let any clean arguments be made

This seems also to be a fuzzy borders argument. So again, just because a concept has fuzzy borders it doesn't invalidate the concept. Ie there's a smooth transition from Chinese people to Swedish people by way of Turkic people and what not along the way, and yet we have no problem whatsoever in identifying who's Ethnically Swedish and who's Ethnically Chinese. At any rate, the typical case of a transperson is not as described, but rather that of one who has battled with their gender identity from a very young age. The clinical presentation coupled with neurological data indicates that transgenderism is analoguous to how gay men have a female presentation in a part of the brain that presumably codes for sexual orientation (and vice versa for lesbian women). Now let's assume that there really is a gender coding module in the brain, and this module is switched in transpeople. Does that necessarily mean ""transwomen are women""? No, that's still a matter of culture. The person claiming it, is essentially asking for us to accept (on this paradigm at any rate), that of all the mosaic that makes up gender, there's really only one necessary and sufficient condition. This one thing is the anchor. I accept this, but it wouldn't be like logically wrong or anything to reject it. At some point a category becomes socially dominant in its interpretation, and I guess in that sense it could be wrong to claim x isnt y, because the identity has been woven into the concept as a matter of language (which isn't private). I don't think transpeople have that strong a foothold in culture just yet, so I wouldn't make that claim at this point in time.

>If it's the cultural norms around gender the drive transgenderism, then transracialism becomes valid so long as the transracial person finds the other race-specific culture authentically more appealing.

Why? How does the categorization of race piggyback on how we categorize gender? No one would argue that if biology drives race entirely then that necessarily means gender is entirely driven by biology, so why would the reverse apply? Let's assume gender is driven entirely by outward presentation. Ie if people assume you're a woman that is what being a woman is, there's nothing else behind the curtain. Why would this have direct implications for how we categorized race? We could categorize race in a myriad of ways and it'd have no implication on gender categorization as far as I can tell. These are independent categories, right?

>Regardless, even if most or all transgender people also desire the sex change, that doesn't demand transracial people need also desire the biological change to authentically desire a different cultural presentation unique to a specific race.

I agree. Because I think they are two completely different categories, and so I don't think the fate of one is tied to the other in either direction. I can be a gender essentialist and a ""race is just culture""-ist, or any other version really. That's why you can be a white man or a white woman, a black man or a black woman. If they weren't independent variables this wouldn't be possible, right?

>And even if it does demand a biological change to be truly transracial, one could assume that in some sophisticated futuristic time, you can genetically manipulate supposedly ""racial"" variables to match whatever you want.

Sure. That's not now though.

>I'm also fairly skeptical that the current trans community would affirm something along the lines of a biological test to determine if one is ""truly"" trans by limiting it to the results of a dimorphism test or etc.

They may not like the idea of such a test, but that's a different discussion. I'm not arguing about what the trans community would like or not like, I'm saying this is, in my view, the scientifically most consistent presentation of the phenomenon. Whether there ought to be a neurological transtest or not is a different discussion.

If cancel culture has one commonality, it's that it's (at the moment), a non-institutional, social media-driven movement that calls for ideas to be shunned or buried.

I'll grant you that. The relevant level of analysis in my anti-Bulgarian beating example and the drive by shooting analogy is of aware agents causing harm, and with a cancellation, it is across a distributed group with no individual controlling agency.

Although I think it invalidates neither, it is a distinction worth pointing out.

>I don't know that the same follows for 'cancel culture,' because the phenomenon we're talking about is one that involves actions and behaviors that are not just justified, but laudatory in a wide variety of circumstances.

I don't accept this. The anti-Bulgarian bullies could have felt equally justified. The drive-by shooter could also have felt justified. The idea that good intentions or a sense that your actions are justified seems to be very much based on point of view. Intergenerational tribal violence between two warring clans seems absurd to an outsider, but totally justified to someone who is within that bad equilibrium.

>Do I want academics to call shit out on twitter and send angry letters and resign from editorial board positions when they find something genuinely ethically objectionable? Yeah, I really, *really* do.

Sure, and in an equilibrium where the incentives align to promote a healthy academic world, that makes sense. You do understand that this can *not* be the case at times, correct?

Imagine (and I'm not saying this describes the current dynamic, but it could describe a possible dynamic, and a lesser version *could* describe the current dynamic) a dynamic where academia is torn between two warring Byzantine chariot-racing clubs, the Blues and the Greens. There are other minority clubs (Whites and Reds), but those two clubs are the largest and the most powerful. When a philosopher advances a position that seems to align with Blue values, the Greens express their absolute and total disdain for those positions, and the reverse is true. Initially academia is not captured by Blues or Greens, and many academics are completely uninterested in chariot-racing. When their tendentious Blue or Green colleagues demand to know where their loyalties lie, these uninterested academics say that are achariotical, or they pick White or Red to appear neutral. Eventually one team's fans start to capture a particular academic field. We'll say the Blues, and so when seeming Green-aligned academics or positions are advanced, the full moral opprobrium is launched at them. Greens are slowly marginalised in the field. Advancing a Green position, regardless of how much it makes sense or could be useful as an alternative perspective, is met with the sort of pushback and pain that used to be reserved for those advancing truly objectionable positions. Even Green positions supported by strong evidence, and with no moral issues at their core, are dismissed from polite Blue circles due to their adjacency to Greenness. At a certain point the field enters into a Blue purity spiral where Red and White are seen as mere complicity with Greenness, and achariot people are looked at with disdain for being cowardly fence sitters. The equilibrium now promotes Blue ideas to the top, even wackadoo ones, and Green ideas, which are no more or less sensible than Blue ideas intrinsically, are treated to every form of censure allowed by law. The more Blue someone is, the more they seem like a good person, and soon the pantheon of Blue values begins to include ideas that seem crazy to non-Blues, and that the Blues themselves would see as crazy if only they had been subjected to proper scrutiny. Economics remains Green I guess.

Even in the world of Byzantine chariot madness capturing academia, I still want academics to be able to call shit out on twitter and send angry letters and resign from editorial board positions when they find something genuinely ethically objectionable, but to not recognise that the equilibrium is stuck in a bad place *because this is the norm* is to be willfully blind to the dynamics.

>As far as I can tell, the framing of 'cancel culture' asks me to throw all this into a blender and wag my finger at the whole 'mob,' even though I probably couldn't tell a significant fraction of them what it was they had done wrong...

Agreed, and although I think the concept of cancel culture is useful, I see nothing about acknowledging that as being close to making it soluble. This is true *even with the chariot racers.*

I think cancel culture is useful *descriptively* and as a diagnosis, but we do not have the cure.

As for you trying to grapple with the vagueness of it all, that's the problem. Everything you've listed (especially the technology interrupting the equilibrium of action and response) are part of the phenomenon.

>I do think it's fair to say that the term 'cancel culture,' in its most frequent incarnations, has a partisan valence.

I agree, and I think it often has a left-wing flavour (probably since it is driven by moral outrage), but that is not an essential characteristic, nor do I think a debate over ""who does it worse"" is useful. Even if the left waved a magic wand and eliminated this dynamic in its own ranks tomorrow, the remainder of the phenomenon in right-wing and apolitical circles is enough to be intolerable on its own without left-wing help.

>but more often than not it circulates with a connotation that 'wokeness run amok' is the main culprit here.

Plenty of members of these historically marginalized groups vehemently disagree with the activists who are ""expressing the voice of the historically voiceless"" on their behalf and without their consent. Saying that these immutable-identity groups have a ""voice"" as opposed to a vast diversity of opinion is fundamentally problematic for me, and it has all sorts of negative consequences for the dissidents *within* those groups.

While I can see the distinction you're making and I agree that it aligns descriptively with the way 'cancel culture' is used, it's worth considering the logical extension here. If this is where the cleavage lies, then fighting against 'cancel culture' isn't so much about a commitment to free speech or protecting heterodox ideas, but rather about *who* gets to decide on the outer boundaries of acceptable public discourse. And as much as I understand folks have a visceral reaction to the imagery of ""mobs,"" when you consider that the alternative is allowing that power to remain firmly in the hands of institutional elites, it starts to look profoundly antidemocratic."
3508,2020-08-20 17:44:59,ic5y6z,">I don't accept this. The anti-Bulgarian bullies could have felt equally justified...

Just to clarify, I'm not arguing that people feel or see themselves as justified, I'm arguing that the actions they're taking would actually *be* justified in a wide variety of circumstances (unlike a drive-by). And if we set aside the ""mob"" dynamics for a moment, I think many of the participants in this case would be totally kosher -- calling a dumb argument dumb is, generally speaking, good and healthy for public discourse. Of course, tweeting about how dumb the argument is when there's a group of people actively trying to get her fired, knowing your tweet will be read as a tacit endorsement of that, changes the situation quite a bit.

>Sure, and in an equilibrium where the incentives align to promote a healthy academic world, that makes sense. You do understand that this can not be the case at times, correct?

Definitely, and I think it's reasonable to posit that we may be in such a time now. But my inclination there would be to realign those incentives -- e.g. off the top of my head, a law that says ""you can't fire someone for dumb shit they say on Twitter"" would remove a lot of the motivation for some of these cases. Stronger institutional boundaries and protections, such as a commitment to only retract an article under conditions x, y, or z, seem to me the only real way to move forward. To be clear: I don't think those institutional measures are easy to craft or enforce well, or that they would eliminate the problem entirely, I'm just suggesting that they would be a *more* effective route than trying to shame the cancellers. That outlook is maybe why I'm more inclined to see the present case as a 'win' -- it wasn't just one editor at the journal that stood up for her, it was her department chair and deans, promotion and tenure committees, and by extension, the Chancellor/provosts/trustees, etc. The institutions did what they were supposed to do. My sense, and maybe you disagree here, is that if this were the typical result of 'cancel culture,' we would see a lot less of it.

>Even in the world of Byzantine chariot madness capturing academia

Let me just say, as an academic, that this would *definitely* make for a much more exciting career.

>but to not recognise that the equilibrium is stuck in a bad place because this is the norm is to be willfully blind to the dynamics.

I would 100% agree that online communication and social media have created some really unhealthy and untenable systems, of which this kind of outrage mob is one of the premier examples. The only place I might push back a little bit here is that I'm doubtful that we are particularly ""stuck"" -- whether things get much better or much worse, I don't necessarily expect them to look the same over the next 5 years. Whatever is going on seems, to me, to still be highly dynamic and evolving."

It's a radically different political environment. Blowouts used to be a regular feature in national elections, but 2008 is the closest thing you'll find to a blowout since the Reagan era, and it pales in comparison. The electorate is more polarized and that polarization is regionally concentrated -- Santa Claus (D) would lose to Jeffrey Dahmer (R) in Arkansas, and if you reverse the party affiliation the same holds true in California.

 If Biden does as well in November as he's polling today, you're looking at something comparable to 2008: i.e. the closest thing realistically possible to a blowout given the structural forces at play here. That is a big if, of course."

Yes, but I don't think this is ~~un~~surprising. Newspapers and journals are intentionally setup as undemocratic hierarchies. Decision-making power is held in the hands of a few, and their only accountability is the profit and reputation of the institution they run (and, relatedly, shareholder opinion if they're publicly traded).

Even if they start heeding the ""wisdom of the crowd"" more, and thus appear more democratic, the final decision is still in their hands. *""Cancelling"" people by calling for their firing or hurting their reputations is, ironically, incentivized by the very way corporate-like hierarchies are set up.

Mm... There's a lot to unpack here (did I just channel Sam?). On the one hand: yes, again, this is descriptively true of modern media empires. But if 'intentionally' is meant to imply that this was an act of social engineering (as opposed to the ordinary dynamics of capital accumulation), I'm less convinced. I can't speak to other liberal democracies, but historically the US was overrun with newspapers until the late 20th century, ranging from major metros with circulation in the hundreds of thousands to weeklies being printed out of someone's garage, union bulletins, ethnic newspapers, etc. etc. etc. While almost all of these were setup hierarchically vis a vis their internal editorial processes (barring the occasional anarchist rag), the collective output of the whole system was probably closer in its democratic impulses to a twitter mob than to, say, cable news (where three corporations control the whole game).

>""Cancelling"" people by calling for their firing or hurting their  reputations is, ironically, incentivized by the very way corporate-like  hierarchies are set up. 

Yes, this part I agree with entirely. And it leads back, in part, to what I was obliquely referencing above. If their aim is to protect people from being fired for expressing unpopular political views, pass some workers' rights bills guaranteeing protection for expression that takes place off the clock. That will protect the speech they're worried about and eliminate the incentive for the mob to form in the first place. The constant critique of the 'mob,' on the other hand, says nothing about the fact that we're vulnerable to all these same things if/when/where our bosses, promotion committees, etc. disagree with our views. I.e. winning the fight against 'cancel culture' won't protect any political speech at all -- it will just restrict the ability to act to folks who are already wealthy/powerful/institutionally well-situated."

Agreed, and as I've said recently, the anti-cancel culture group (aCCers) *should* focus their op-ed targets on bosses, not the Mob. The Mob isn't always the same group of people, and they probably think most aCCers are worthless elites anyway.

On the flip side, it's bosses who *actually* choose to fire someone, they're a smaller group of people, and probably like many of the aCCers (read the NYT, Atlantic, etc). *That's* the culture they actually have a chance of changing. It may even lead to concrete changes, like workers' rights."

Also it doesn’t have to happen to that many people. If you go to a college and 1 person gets kicked out for cheating, it sets an example for everyone else and they’re scared to cheat. Except in this example, “cheating” is being someone or being close to someone who expresses a heterodox thought or gets accused (rightfully or wrongfully) of causing harm

What’s strangest about the last stronghold of people willing to die on this hill is that they can’t decide if a) cancel culture doesn’t exist b) cancel culture has always existed c) cancel culture doesn’t exist and is good or d) cancel culture does exist but it’s just “accountability”

Either way I’m happy that these people still exist as they act as a natural repellent. Everyone I’ve talked to who has “walked away” or been “redpilled” over the past few years has a defining moment they felt things went too far, and for many of them, that moment is essentially a “canceling”

Neoliberal, but also wedded to ideas of American power, Western exceptionalism, state authority and more. In the U.S. this gets clouded because on strict policy terms he's certainly more aligned with the Democrats, which are in effect the left-wing party. But were he in that party apparatus he'd very much be on the conservative end, highly suspicious of the more radical or activist side of the party, protective of the corporate and military/security wings. It's also notable that while he would align with the party on policy terms, he doesn't actually think particularly deeply about policy, preferring instead to make arguments for what amount to a maintenance of the status quo, and where he agrees progress is necessary, he prefers that change not be especially drastic. Real nipping around the edges stuff. It's just a definitionally conservative worldview and approach to politics and social change in most respects.

It's not an accident that when you look at the people he boosts the most, they tend to be on the conservative end of the Democratic Party, or they're literally Republicans. Folks like David Frum and Andrew Sullivan, who seem to most align with his views. These are conservatives, and they remain conservatives despite believing in some policies more generally associated with liberals or the left.

I wouldn't want to read your mind, so I'll speak from my own socialist leanings to say that whatever concerns I have about ""wokeness"" politically have to do with a kind of inflexibility in coalition building that I think is necessary, particularly in a two-party system. I think Harris shares this concern to some degree, but I think his bigger concern is that he actually thinks we've progressed enough as a society that these identity issues are not actually issues anymore, and that the people pressing them are basically maniacs trying to disrupt the natural order of things.

> It's not an accident that when you look at the people he boosts the most, they tend to be on the conservative end of the Democratic Party, or they're literally Republicans. Folks like David Frum and Andrew Sullivan, who seem to most align with his views. These are conservatives, and they remain conservatives despite believing in some policies more generally associated with liberals or the left.

Well I just don't see this as boosting. First I'd say Frum and Sullivan are both more prominent than Harris so if anything they are boosting him. But at the end of the day I want to hear what conservative intellectuals think - I'd love it if Harris had Steve Bannon (who is also much more famous than Harris) on the podcast, because I think it'd be an interesting conversation of a sort that rarely happens (between liberal and conservative intellectuals who are being civil).

>  concerns I have about ""wokeness"" politically have to do with a kind of inflexibility in coalition building that I think is necessary, particularly in a two-party system. I think Harris shares this concern to some degree

I'd be more blunt in my assessment of it; woke ideas are a wedge that divides the working class by creating false consciousness based on racial thinking, vilifying the white working class and making any sort of broad worker coalition completely impossible. 

>  but I think his bigger concern is that he actually thinks we've progressed enough as a society that these identity issues are not actually issues anymore, and that the people pressing them are basically maniacs trying to disrupt the natural order of things.

I don't think that's fair. He and many other people who are concerned about woke issues simply point out all the progress we've made doing things in the pre-""woke"" way, and question whether doing things a different, more ""woke"" way will lead to faster progress in the long run. And that's not because change is scary *in general*, but because ""woke"" people have a litany of very bad ideas with foreseeable negative consequences."
3544,2020-08-21 17:02:13,ic5y6z,"I gave my reasoning for coming to my conclusion about what Harris was doing with that episode. Care to offer me a reason I should think otherwise, or will you just claim I'm wrong and be satisfied with that?"
3545,2020-08-19 18:37:56,ic5y6z,"The term is in quotes for a reason. But hey, whatever makes you feel better"
3546,2020-08-19 13:58:00,ic5y6z,"I think if Harris heard you talking about Marxist stuff like that he'd fucking shit a brick. The guy thought Bernie Sanders was too extreme. He boosts people like Frum because he agrees with them. In this conversation I'm not concerned with the platform he gives them so much as the fact that these are the only people he promotes, because he listens to them the most and agrees with them the most, because he's conservative. Harris' ""liberal goals,"" to the extent they can be gleaned, are about a maintenance of American hegemony and Western power as currently established. He derides Black Lives Matter not because they might cleave the working class apart, but because he is threatened by the idea that fixing the effects of racism in the United States requires serious, drastic action, action which might disrupt the status quo he greatly benefits from. Again, I point to his loving on MLK in the present, but in the past, he would've been turned off by his radicalism. Because MLK was, in fact, a radical and a socialist. Harris doesn't just point to all the progress made, he makes an argument that further progress in many areas is unnecessary. That systemic racism, as an example, is not a relevant issue in the present and to focus on dismantling it is a kind of delusion. He holds these views because he finds the alternative threatening, scary, because he's a conservative. It's not all that unexpected for a guy with his background, really."
3547,2020-08-21 18:00:54,ic5y6z,"Your conclusion of why you did not frame Sam's conversation in a disingenuous way was.

""Or the most accurate way. I suppose it’s a matter of perspective.""

Was reasoned with the following.

""spending two hours using poor data to explain why BLM is literally protesting an issue that according to Harris does not exist.""

Why this is wrong 

1. Data is not poor. Poor data is data collected badly from unreliable sources. The data was supplied by multiple reliable sources. Among others
It included scholarly papers by PhDs. 
It included FBI collected statistics
It included Washington post statistical database specifically made to collect data on the issue. 
You may claim this one incomplete, bad therefore not indicative of the whole story ( you would also be required to supply the rest of the data story then also) but you cannot make the claim this is bad data.

2. You stated ""he did a whole podcast on why BLM is based on a lie"" 
This he did not. It was only a portion within the podcast episode #207 where spoke about the protest, civil unrest and the police brutality data he was aware of as a whole. He spoke about where he believed they had justification. Where he believed they were unjustified and  where the protest equated to ""madness"" he also spoke about BLM within the podcast and how he viewed them and their involvement withing the protests. 

3. The claim of unfair amounts of police brutality against black people is not based in BLM. Sam in podcast #207 took aim at both the claim and BLM.

In conclusion, your statement 

""he did a whole podcast on why BLM is based on a lie""

Is wrong and therefore disingenuous, as if you had listened to the podcast ( as you of course have) you are aware your statement is wrong. Your conclusion of 

""Or the most accurate way. I suppose it’s a matter of perspective.""

Is wrong as your statement is wrong. Your reasoning for your perspective is also therefore based on an incorrect claim and therefore wrong.

Er go you are wrong."

That's all speculation which I have to say I disagree with. (Edit: Though I probably wouldn't use Marxist terminology with Sam because he'd probably not understand it, and it's not that hard to use plainer language to say the same thing)

> He derides Black Lives Matter not because they might cleave the working class apart, but because he is threatened by the idea that fixing the effects of racism in the United States requires serious, drastic action, action which might disrupt the status quo he greatly benefits from

Well, I don't see thinking something is misguided is the same as being threatened by it. I think BLM is misguided on a variety of things, but I'm not ""threatened"" by them. I'll be fine, and Sam Harris will be even more fine than me (given his greater financial success)."

3550,2020-08-19 14:52:16,ic5y6z,"I see him as feeling threatened because of his constant, overwhelming concern about these issues over many far more serious issues, as well as his frequent exaggeration of them and his support for liars like Weiss. A reasonable person should not be won over by people like Weiss, but Harris is not actually a reasonable person despite his calm demeanour. Of course I can't know for sure what goes on in his head, but his actions speak loudly, to me at least."

Originally ruled by Mars, Scorpio by nature is a very provocative sign that lusts for glory and power. Unlike an Aries, it will use any means to get it, at times even unfair means. A lesser evolved Scorpio has a tendency to play petty power games to get ahead and take advantage of certain people who stand in its way.

At some point, it runs into someone who is not putting up with the nonsense (usually strong Capricorn, Leo, or Gemini placements). That person gets angered and takes some serious action against it. In other words, the Scorpio does not learn out of guilt but rather fear of repercussions which signs like Leos and Capricorns are all too good at giving it, often being able to out-strategize and outmaneuver the *lesser* evolved Scorpio with ease.

After getting put in its place and on its back, it realizes that the world is not full of people who will bend to its petty power games and after having things like a layoff, beatdown, or serious reputation damage happen to it; it transforms into a better being."

I also have my scorpio moon in the 8th house aspected by saturn in 12th, so it gets a bit intense, however, I think the challenge for any scorpio placement is to die and to go through rebirth... but it is painful.

He did not have the sex change yet but that was a significant time in his life. When he went through the transition  that was around 2016? Pluto in Capricorn was near his moon and Jupiter, close to a conjunction. After that conjunction ends he will probably feel like he has really come into his own identity emotionally.

3632,2020-08-07 10:01:52,i56qrp,"Probably will begin to see the fruits of that generations efforts in the 2030s as Uranus moves through Cancer and hits the halfway point of the Uranus cycle and makes an opposition to the Uranus/Neptune conjunction most millennials have. Neptune will also be transiting through Aries at that time meaning the entire generation will experience a pseudo-T-Square between their Natal Uranus/Neptune conjunction opposite Tranist Uranus square Transit Neptune. Somewhat of note since it's just the same two planets in the natal and transit affecting a whole generation.

edit: I forgot at the same time Pluto in the late degrees of Aquarius will also be square to the Natal Pluto of the generation as well. So all three outer planets that define the generation will be in hard aspect to their respective natal positions. That influence will be the strongest around 2035-2038 although the energy will be present to varying degrees at the beginning of the decade."

I honestly would have suggested that if you’re uncomfortable with a person not to live with them, but I understand finding roommates in college sucks and she’s probably a better bet than someone you don’t know at all. It doesn’t sound like your particularly close to this person. So maybe just leave it as is for now and remind yourself that people aren’t all bad or all good. She obviously has some flaws that aren’t pleasant, but so do the rest of us. Ideally I would tell you to be more assertive. If she made any comments like that in the future, I would tell her I am uncomfortable with the comments and please not to make similar ones in the future. Now if you find yourself becoming good friends there may be a point when you’re able discuss it openly and get her opinion and share yours without it turning into a fight. Sorry this isn’t very eloquent, but I found your explanation of the situation and the situation itself intriguing."

3654,2020-07-27 00:00:13,hyh80c,"This is a difficult decision to make I know and I want to extend my empathy to you and your situation. It is against the rules for us here to promote surgery, and I would also ask you take a look on this sub to read posts from trans women and detrans males who do have regrets about their SRS to help you consider your options.

A turn of phrase I’m drawn to and would like to highlight is that you say SRS would make your life easier “as a woman” and I can understand why you may feel this way. Something I would suggest to you is not to think about your life as a woman but your life as yours, what would make you as a person most happy and comfortable for the long term future? Would you be content to live without your primary sex organ in its natural state? A vaginoplasty is not the same as having a penis or a vulva, it will not make you biologically female so to speak. I would also like to note that it is frequently reported that gender dysphoria worsens or migrates within transition, what you’re experiencing is not unusual and may or may not be alleviated by SRS.

As far as I am concerned living and breathing your life as a trans woman is enough to make you a woman, I deeply disagree with people feeling pigeon holed into getting extremely serious and life changing surgery unless it is what they truly desire and need to feel happy in themselves. 

It is okay to take time to make this decision. Consider your future carefully, be prepared for less than ideal results and the upkeep that comes with the process. Know that it is a big commitment. Take care and I wish you luck, whatever your decision."

Google who the photographer was for the Caitlyn Jenner photoshoot for Vanity Fair.

Cases of gender dysphoria in the children of several western nations has increased by over 1000% in less than 10 years.

A UK government endorsed charity, Mermaids, encourages the use of hormones and puberty blockers on children.

Transgenderism is the most astroturfed faux-struggle that has been enforced and encouraged despite huge public outcry.

The roots of this less than 5 year old phenomenon are found in the Institut Für Sexualwissenschaft and Weimar Germany.

The institute was founded by Magnus and Arthur Hirschfeld, which lead to the first transgender surgeries. Fortunately, the literature of the institute was almost entirely burned.

Interestingly enough, most of the books that were burned under Hitler's regime were from this institute.

Also the guy that invented the separation between sex and gender tortured a boy mutilated at birth by a botched circumcision by trying to raise him as a girl. The boy would eventually commit suicide along with his brother."

3691,2020-09-07 03:51:05,inzz87,"I would strongly recommend you speak to a therapist. Not because you're broken and need to be fixed, but because a good therapist can help you understand your emotions and behavior and relationships in a way that can be extremely beneficial. Therapy might help you with strategies for navigating your relationship with you mom (and others).

If you are looking for a church home that is welcoming and accepting, they are out there. My family belongs to a United Methodist Church that that strives to accept, value and celebrate everyone and we certainly have church members of the LGBTQ community. (Though this is definitely not true of ALL United Methodist Churches.) I have also attended a few Unitarian Universalist churches and they are also welcoming of LGBTQ people. 

I'm afraid that I have no specific advice or wisdom to pass along but I will say that no one can tell you who you are except you. You are a person of inherent worth and value and you deserve to be accepted and loved for the person you are."

Is my own happiness worth it to lose the people I care about the most. I don’t know if I could live like that. Any advice or help sure would be appreciated.""

Yeah that's the dilemma. We are told to deny ourselves and love our family and neighbors. Yet the thing is others get angry of you being you when it's harmless. A balancing issue. I get it. Still chewing it myself."
3693,2020-09-07 06:20:07,inzktu,"This is difficult and there is no one right answer, so this is absolutely not telling you what to do. 

But, I want to interrogate the idea that being trans/transitioning would make you lose everyone and everything you love. I don’t know you or your circumstance, so maybe this is true. But I also think, often it is more nuanced. Often there are people who will surprise you by being supportive. Often, there are people you don’t even really know that well, but are 100% on your team and would take a stand for you. Often, there are friends and neighbors waiting just around the corner, who can be the people you need around you. 

Sometimes, that’s not true. It is absolutely a risk. And you’re the only one who can make that call. But since this is TransChristianity, I do want to say that there is always one person you will never lose, and that’s God. God is with you through all of it. And God’s love manifests in many ways. 

I don’t know if that means transitioning is right for you, but I pray deeply that whatever path you take, it leads you to peace."
3694,2020-09-07 06:24:46,inzktu,"> Would I be willing to lose everything and everyone just to make myself happy? Is my own happiness worth it to lose the people I care about the most. I don’t know if I could live like that.

There are many things we can sacrifice for others, even nobly, up to and including our lives; but *who we are* is not on that list. You can't sacrifice who you are; it's unnatural, and if you try you'll only cause yourself pain until you stop. It's not selfish to be you; it's actually selfish of someone else to demand that you not be.

To be fair, cis people generally don't realize they're being selfish; they can't relate to this. There is nothing like it in their world. They have no frame of reference. It's as if they could only see in black-and-white, and we were trying to explain color to them -- or like trying to explain what it's like to see to someone born blind. They usually think we have a choice whether or not to transition -- that is, live as who we really are (that's what transitioning means). Some trans people think this way, too, in the beginning; they may think, like their cis families, ""I've lived this way so far, why can't I keep doing it and avoid all the pain that comes with transitioning?"" Again, to try to live as something you're not isn't natural and will bring you much more pain that what comes with transitioning.

There is nothing you can lose that is as bad as losing yourself.

I think transitioning is no bed of roses for most people; but, in the end, I think most of us are glad we did it. I lived a lifetime thinking I was male and trying to live as one; outside my spiritual life, transitioning is, hands down, the best thing that ever happened to me. I found myself, I embraced who I was and now I live as who I am. There is no comparison to my life before.

You probably know that your mother's comment about signs is incorrect, both in your particular case and generally speaking. You can't go into this conditioned upon her approval or permission; you have to approach it in your conversations with her as something that is going to happen, regardless of who supports you and who doesn't. You don't have to be confrontational; you can be gentle, but you must be firm. This is an aspect of reality that she can't see, but you can; and you have to respond to it or deal with the consequences of denying it.

I should mention, in the interest of full disclosure, that I have heard of trans people who don't transition. My guess is there aren't many, and I don't know what kind of stress they live with. My guess is, a lot. Me, I would go crazy. It's one thing before you know about yourself; after, it's like an irresistible force.

As I said, cis people can't empathize with our experience; the most they are capable of is acceptance and support. Furthermore, I think it's rare for cis people to see us as real women, unless we pass and live stealth; if they know we're trans, it's more than most of them seem to be able to do. There are exceptions. I think cis people need some kind of epiphany before they wake up to the fact that we're really girls. So, be prepared for that.

I have thought of an amusing analogy that, I think, conveys *something* of the problem we face. Maybe it will be of use to you in trying to explain things to your mother.

Imagine a family in which everybody is an accountant: Mom, Dad, brothers, uncles, cousins, grandparents on both sides ... It's what your family does. You grow up knowing you'll do the same. It never enters your mind that you might do anything else with your life. Then, you go to university, and while there, you discover a previously unknown talent for art -- and not simply a talent, but a great one. And you love it. All the signs are that this is what you were born to do. You're thrilled because you've discovered who you are and what you were meant to be.

Then you go home and break the news; and all hell breaks loose. ""Are you crazy? Artists are flakes! Losers! Immoral! And *nobody* can make a living in art! You're throwing your life away! Don't come crying to us when you're out on the street!"" They can't see what you see, or feel what you feel.

What should you do? Conform to their vision of who you are and who you should be? or to your own?

I hope some of this helps, sis. Good luck. :)

EDIT: Since I referenced my spiritual life, I should probably also say that, while I recognize the divinity of Jesus, my beliefs are sufficiently divergent that I would not call myself a Christian. That may make a difference to you concerning the reliability of my advice; so, I thought you should know."

I have known others who are MTF, and from my limited second hand knowledge, it sounds to me like you are trans. And it sounds to me though like you did know when you were younger, you just didn't have words to express it. 

Those that I have known who transitioned, and lost friends or family because of it, all seemed to be ultimately happier to be able to finally be themselves. 

I can tell you that in my personal opinion, anyone who rejects you for just trying to be yourself isn't worth your time or effort. Those who truly care will support you.

Honestly, only you can decide how you feel and what you should do, and I think you'd get much better advice from others who have experienced what you're feeling. I'm sure there are subs more specifically for trans people and issues.

Sorry I can't help more."

3699,2020-09-07 03:05:04,iny9jd,"I didn't figure out I was bisexual until I was 26. Attraction and identity can be so nuanced and confusing. It sounds like you definitely have signs. What helped me was to perform an inner thought experiment. ""What if I AM bi... Would that make sense?"" I basically tried it on, I thought about all the signs in my life, if they made more sense through I bisexual lense than anything else.. everything fell into place tbh. 

Try not to think about the logistics of transition yet,  let yourself feel gender euphoria and or dysphoria when you explore, whether mentally or with material things"

I can't decide for you, but you sound pretty trans to me. I don't think it's really a cis thought to question your identity like this, and the desire to wear female clothing, etc. It's exactly how I first felt when I was questioning."
3703,2020-09-07 05:43:00,inx0yx,"So, you presented a lot of evidence to suggest that you are trans.  Unfortunately, there isn't a definite yes/no test we can take.  I came out as trans on my 27th birthday. I started hrt 2 years later. When I came out, I had even less evidence than you have shared in this thread, but I had met and spoken with some trans women, and I wanted what they had.  I have no doubts now.  Transition was wonderful, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.

3706,2020-09-06 23:23:38,invzdz,"Your own happiness is 100% worth it. Anyone who truly cares about you will understand and still love you, because you are still YOU! You wont change except for your gender, and that shouldnt matter to people. You sound like a girl to me, only girls want to be girls you know? And hey, theres plenty of communities and support groups for you to talk to, and id maybe reccomended starting therapy with a trans therapist, so you can learn how to cope with gender dysphoria and the general public that tends to be transphobic. Me and my gf are both trans, and going on hormones honestly saved our lives. Life got so much better, albeit a bit harder with different new hurdles to jump, and more... well. Lively? I feel more alive and more my self than i ever have. The quality of life you have when you truly are yourself and surround yourself with people who care about you and see you as you are is incredible. And surgeries these days are so amazing, especially mtf ones! Modern science is truly incredible in what it can achieve. YOU yes YOU can be a pretty girl on hormones. Girl puberty isnt out of reach for you! 
And plenty of trans people dont know theyre trans until adulthood. We repress stuff SO much and again, society is so transphobic and teaches trans people, especially transfem people, that being trans is a joke or not real or a trick. Trust your self and know who you are. My mom said the same thing, that there were no signs, but now that im on hormones she respects me more and understands more. Besides, are cis people really qualified to notice signs of being trans? I mean from what you say here you look back on your life and its one egg moment after another, same as me and every other trans person! You know you better than anyone else and if you want to transition, then do what will make you happy!
Anyways, i wish you all the luck and happiness in the world and im proud of you for doing all this introspection. We (fellow trans people) have your back and can answer questions you may have. Take care of yourself!"

That's a choice a lot of us face -but it doesn't have to be that drastic.  

I would encourage you to simply think about it, and then seek counseling if you're able to afford it. There's ways you can dip your toes in the water without signing up for the full package.  

I first confronted this issue when I was your age (this is the senior's sub; ""when I was your age"" lectures are derigeur ;)) and I made the mistake of thinking I could shrug it off -and i did until very recently.  

I was happy ...enough. But if I could change it I'd take it more seriously and realize that is a constant influence on how you see and relate to the world and other people; regardless of wether you act on it or not.  

So the biggest piece of advice I'd offer you would be to go slow (you have DECADES ahead of you -don't let anyone tell you otherwise) and even if you're unable to transistion (for the moment) do your best to understand how this shapes your inner self (your heart, you psychological makeup, etc).  

You don't have to transistion now; simply take this seriously and look for ways to discover your inner self and nurture it. 

Good luck!"
3708,2020-09-07 07:26:15,invzdz,"I never thought that I was Trans when I was a kid/Teen, or even YA. Looking back, I can think of a number of things that could now be seen as possible sign posts about where things might be heading for me. I sometimes would fantasize about sex from a female POV and experimented w/ cross dressing a bit. But I kept most of that carefully under wraps until about 6 years ago(Im now 61), when I started trying to understand who I really was. 3 years ago I started HRT and eventually came out as Trans. Life has been great ever since :)  Advice: Dont be in any hurry to make ANY life altering  decisions. Find a GOOD therapist that specializes in gender identity issues, and is someone you feel comfortable talking w/. Try to find a local support group too. Experiment w/ cross dressing. Try a few things like shaving our legs, or wearing ear rings, nail color, and lipstick. See how they make you feel. If you can put up w/ the occasional, ""when I was your age"" stories ;) Feel free to check in w/ your older and more experienced ""Aunts"" here whenever you like to ;) Good luck :)

Edit: I didnt initially notice your opening comment about having Autism. I only recently have heard that being Trans and having ASD frequently overlaps. For many years, before I knew I was Trans, I had frequently said that Im quite sure that if I were growing up over the past 20 years or so, I have no doubt that I would have been tagged as being on the Autism spectrum to some degree."

I’m an autistic ftm partway through transition, and I assure you that if you decide you’re trans, there is a loving community out there to support you. Your happiness is worth it. I didn’t ‘show signs’ either as a kid, that doesn’t in any way invalidate you and your journey. Good vibes <3"

3718,2020-09-06 22:06:13,intrmm,That's OK too!
3719,2020-09-06 16:03:53,innbtj,"I think Kris was in denial whenever it first came up and they just shoved this obvious deal breaker into the depths of the closet hoping it never resurfaced. I feel that a lot of relationships are like that and that's why they eventually fail. 

One thing that stood out to me in this article was that Kris was upset that the kids were asked to keep certain secrets from her. Although I always think Kris' intentions are self serving, Cait sucks in this case because she's asking kids to keep her secrets that are hard to cope with. I wonder if there was any long lasting damage in having to keep secrets. 

Third, can Cait stop claiming she raised 10 kids? She basically dropped out of the first two sets of children. Depositing your sperm and raising kids are two totally different things."
3720,2020-09-06 15:06:47,innbtj,"On the Diane Sawyer special that Caitlyn did, all of her exes knew something. I definitely think that Kris knew, but they she had either downplayed it in her mind, or decided maybe it was just a kink that Caitlyn wanted to dress in women’s clothing.  I also think that Caitlyn would have naturally downplayed it so she wouldn’t worry Kris. 

I think that if Caitlyn had never written that book, they would still be on great terms. It was a breech of trust, and the family works hard to keep what they want private. Kris ESPECIALLY does not take kindly to people putting their business out there."
3721,2020-09-06 16:09:12,innbtj,"Well of course Kris knew. According to Caitlyns book, he had boobs when he met Kris and they had to be removed!"
3722,2020-09-06 17:01:27,innbtj,I think kris knew. Kris knew how much he wanted to transition. So she controlled the finances. He had to ask for permission to do anything.
3723,2020-09-06 16:27:08,innbtj,"""*Kris and I had two kids — Kendall and Kylie. They've done okay for themselves.*""

""Okay""? Are we talking about the same people? The highest paid model and the 'billionnaire' businesswoman?"
3724,2020-09-08 01:10:56,innbtj,Cait is a trash parent
3725,2020-10-28 09:09:07,innbtj,These moments with your partner seem like a dream. But I believe Cait would have stayed with Kris if she would have her. It’s not easy but it is even more amazing to me when the ones transitioning want to keep their partners. And when those partners are willing and wanting to stand by is even more amazing 😍
3726,2020-09-06 17:28:12,innbtj,Has she forgotten Brandon and Brody have said numerous times that she had little to nothing to do with them as kids and David Foster did most of the raising of those two??
3727,2020-09-06 19:56:45,innbtj,This! Her older kids are saints for treating her well and allowing her in their lives regarding years of being absent father.
3728,2020-09-06 18:24:27,innbtj,"These are my thoughts as well. It was around 1990 when Kris and Cait got together, and being transgender/transitioning was not super well known. I think because of her personality, Cait downplayed her desire to be a woman and passed it off as cross dressing. Cait said that she had ""B cup breasts"" when she met Kris but I feel like that's easy to hide or pass off as weight gain, hormone imbalance, etc. I really doubt Kris would marry someone knowing they had this huge secret and go on to have children with them."
3729,2020-09-06 17:21:35,innbtj,"Yup, she controlled the finances for a reason."
3730,2020-09-06 19:01:27,innbtj,Why can’t Kris be single. Is dating a guy with boobs really better than just being alone for a while?
3731,2020-09-06 18:20:41,innbtj,I mean wasn’t Cait flat broke when they got together? I thought it was because Cait couldn’t handle her own money.
3732,2020-09-06 16:29:00,innbtj,I am sure it’s a joke
3733,2020-09-06 18:49:40,innbtj,"She forgets every time she's using her kids as ""proof"" that she's a good person."
3734,2020-09-07 23:00:26,innbtj,"Omg, do you think Kris was worried Cait would transition?"
3735,2020-09-06 23:02:20,innbtj,Not everyone cares about physical differences.
3736,2020-09-06 18:49:58,innbtj,Caitlyn was their only source of income.
3737,2020-09-06 21:01:26,innbtj,And IIRC she gets very upset/deflects if Brody or Brandon bring it up
3738,2020-09-06 19:38:51,innbtj,"That doesn’t negate my point, if she was generating income and spending all of it, she can still be broke."
3739,2020-09-07 00:10:02,innbtj,"She has a very specific look when she does this. She turns her eyes away, presses her lips, and although this can't be seen it seems that she can shut off her hearing too. She does it to her sons and she did it a ton through her transition episodes."
3740,2020-09-06 19:51:01,innbtj,">That doesn’t negate my point, if she was generating income and spending all of it, she can still be broke.


The audacity of that women earning her own income and spending it. Who did kaitlyn think she was.

Kris was the girlfriend at the time so it makes it even stranger to try and justify the financial abuse... but ok..."
3741,2020-09-06 19:53:12,innbtj,">I mean wasn’t Cait flat broke when they got together? I thought it was because Cait couldn’t handle her own money.


Why is it ok to financially abuse your spouse if they can't handle their own money?"
3742,2020-09-06 20:41:04,innbtj,"I don’t think the commenter was trying to justify the financial abuse that she suffered later in life, but Caitlyn did not manage her olympics and sponsorship money well at all. Kris helped her get back on her feet with the motivational speaker circuit."
3743,2020-09-06 20:56:35,innbtj,">I mean wasn’t Cait flat broke when they got together? I thought it was because Cait couldn’t handle her own money.

Why is it ok to financially abuse someone who can't handle their own money? If caitlyn was broke then that is her issue and not an invitation to be abused by their spouse."
3744,2020-09-06 21:30:33,innbtj,"When you establish a partnership and start a family together, your finances are combined. I agree that Kris was overly controlling from what we saw on the show, but some people are just not good with money, and Cait was broke when she and Kris got together. Kris was the one that managed Cait’s motivational speaking career and got their finances back on track. I’m not saying Kris is a saint, far from it, but it’s more nuanced than you’re making it out to be."
3745,2020-09-06 21:09:55,innbtj,"I’m not saying that it is. All I’m going off of is some anecdotal evidence from my relationships and those of friends that when one partner struggles with managing money, it’s not uncommon for one to take care of the bills and spending. 

It probably never should have lasted that long, especially when Kris started raking in KUWTK money. But Caitlyn admitted herself that she had problems managing money and was flat broke with no prospects when she met Kris. Kris worked to promote her and get sponsorship deals, and built her up in a way that allowed them to live."
3746,2020-09-06 22:17:00,innbtj,"Kris got her own kickback from those speeches. She still chose to withhold kaitlyns checks from her.These things were happening before they were married, before kylie and kendall were born. In what world is it ok to withold your partners check for the sake of living the highlife in beverly hills?"
3747,2020-09-06 12:35:40,inkwsy,For sure. Just because you’re trans doesn’t give you a pass for being a complete asshole.
3748,2020-09-06 14:00:04,inkwsy," She just comes across as inconsiderate and uninterested in anyone's life but her own. In my opinion, I think this is truly who Caitlyn is. She only cared about Kylie and Kendall because she was basically forced into it by Kris. Once she was again given freedom to do as she pleases, it seems like she started treating the girls (including the stepdaughters) as she had treated her first kids (brandon, brody, etc) their whole life. I hope she's happy with the choices she's made to only focus on herself and pretend like her kids don't exist, except when its convenient to her image."
3749,2020-09-06 18:10:36,inkwsy,So true. I'm doing a rewatch and I've come to the conclusion the show starts going majorly downhill into unwatchable territory when Cait and Kris announce their divorce.
3750,2020-09-06 16:19:30,inkwsy,What annoys me about Caitlyn is how much she equates being a woman to hair clothes and makeup. Like in her book she said now with her golf buddies 'we just gab and trade style tips.' Um I'm a woman and we don't do that! And she's made such a big deal about makeup and how she spends so much time with her hair and makeup people. I'm sure plenty of women don't care/bother with hair styling fancy clothes and makeup.
3751,2020-09-06 20:46:42,inkwsy,It’s a life of male privilege deciding that they’re now entitled to act like a diva
3752,2020-09-06 15:02:55,inkwsy,"I don't know if you're from the UK, but if you've never heard of *I'm a celebrity, get me out of here* have a look when she was on it, my opinion went full 360. Helped alot of people through tough mental situations aswell"
3753,2020-09-06 13:57:23,inkwsy,She’s clearly overcompensating for insecurities. I really feel sorry for her tbh.
3754,2020-09-06 13:30:47,inkwsy,[deleted]
3755,2020-09-06 21:44:08,inkwsy,">Then after that for Kylies birthday she gifts her a pair of underwear with her FACE PLASTERED ON IT!!!

She's a total creep. 

She's awful in general and always has been but that was just wow."
3756,2020-09-06 23:36:34,inkwsy,How did I miss this underwear incident?
3757,2020-09-08 01:10:10,inkwsy,Cait is an asshole straight up
3758,2020-09-06 17:37:06,inkwsy,"i dont think people appreciate how hard it truly must be to be a celebrity when you feel the pressure and your under more scrutiny, its pretty easy to act more stupidly"
3759,2020-09-07 16:57:23,inkwsy,"I try not to judge her because I don’t think it’s fair of me to as a ciswoman, and I’m still learning and understanding about transgender people and genders, and from the things I have learned so far is that they go through what is essentially puberty for them. Again, I am not super informed so if I’m wrong please correct me, but I think that’s a major deal for their body and mind. I mean, most teenagers go through a major shift when their bodies are changing so imagine someone that is transitioning. 

 As a parent though, I do side eye her (and I guess I do judge her for that) for abandoning her first 4 kids (something my mom did with my older brothers), but regarding the “sexist remarks”, my personal opinion is that she is probably ecstatic to finally get to do what she has always wanted to do. Like someone said, she might just be a girly girl. I’m not super girly, but I definitely love getting my hair done, make up, shopping etc, but I don’t think that her dumb tone deaf joke meant that it strictly defines all women. As a feminist, I think every woman is entitled to feel whatever it is they think defines them. 

Whew that was a long comment, sorry I just took my Ritalin 😂"
3760,2020-09-06 15:21:02,inkwsy,"in a time when literal nazis are on the rise, can we not say stupid shit like accuse a prominent trans woman of being a “brand nazi”? thanks."
3761,2020-09-06 14:05:13,inkwsy,THIS!!!!!!
3762,2020-09-07 03:58:26,inkwsy,I agree so much
3763,2020-09-06 14:36:56,inkwsy,They've said before how Kris didn't want anymore kids but Cait did. Kris didn't force her into anything with those kids. She had more kids for Cait.
3764,2020-09-06 14:04:31,inkwsy,"Ehhh I don’t believe caitlyn was forced into having more kids or being an active parent with Kris. Caitlyn has 4 prior biological children that she ghosted. Unless cait is really confused on how reproduction works, she had agency in terms of her parenthood."
3765,2020-09-06 20:21:24,inkwsy,"I totally agree. I think that it was when Kylie turned 18 that she posted in social medial that ""her work was done"". I didn't know that once your children reached that age, you could stop being a parent."
3766,2020-09-06 18:30:46,inkwsy,"Yes that is truly the turning point. Cait really brought a certain dynamic, and without it it’s become so dry"
3767,2020-09-06 21:44:56,inkwsy,Didn’t she say the hardest part of being a trans woman was choosing what to wear?
3768,2020-09-06 21:05:15,inkwsy,Agreed. Seemed to just perpetuate the same stereotypes that aren’t supposed to define us as women.
3769,2020-09-06 17:05:16,inkwsy,i think she’s just excited to finally be able to do hair and makeup and talk about it!! shes a girly girl!
3770,2020-09-07 11:52:41,inkwsy,"I think she was/is over compensating her lost time for sure. Maybe it's to do with her being rich also, she has more freetime to do nothing compared to the average person🤷‍♀️"
3771,2020-09-06 22:26:20,inkwsy,💯💯💯💯
3772,2020-09-06 17:15:24,inkwsy,[deleted]
3773,2020-09-06 17:09:15,inkwsy,what happened on it?
3774,2020-09-06 15:24:57,inkwsy,Really? I remember hearing about it but I didn’t know how she did on it. I have to check it out!
3775,2020-09-06 14:02:50,inkwsy,I would feel sorry for her if she wasn’t a murderer. Sorry but I think she’s always been the same inconsiderate asshole.
3776,2020-09-06 15:40:18,inkwsy,"Yeah, and she was obviously excited about being able to talk about that stuff openly for the first time."
3777,2020-09-06 18:07:03,inkwsy,Thanks thats kinda what I was thinking. She was probably excited about getting to just use a purse in public.
3778,2020-09-06 17:02:09,inkwsy,"yeah, i thought it was kind of cute how excited she was!"
3779,2020-09-08 00:43:35,inkwsy,"Yep, I had a friend who came out as a trans man. Two years later they made a gender declaration that after seizing their masculinity, they would now like to be acknowledged as gender fluid. After years of suppressing their other gender a lot of trans people will ""over correct"". Its totally normal."
3780,2020-09-06 18:01:32,inkwsy,Naaa naaa na na
3781,2020-09-06 18:29:19,inkwsy,What does her being trans have anything to do with it?
3782,2020-09-06 15:41:02,inkwsy,it’s really not that deep - pls get over yourself
3783,2020-09-06 19:54:35,inkwsy,"Ikr ""brand obsession"" would be better. It has a clearer meaning anyway as I was confused by what was meant by ""brand nazi."" Like was Cait persecuting/murdering innocent brands?

I'm not sure when ""nazi"" became a term for describing a fanatic/obsessed person. Either way not cute at all"
3784,2020-09-06 16:56:12,inkwsy,"True. But maybe what they meant is kris forced him to stay and actually act like a parent this time.
I could see that."
3785,2020-09-06 19:24:43,inkwsy,In Kris’s autobiography (don’t judge) she said she “always wanted 6 kids”
3786,2020-09-06 17:48:42,inkwsy,If anything I’d say she felt guilty for how she treated her first children and Kendall and Kylie would be like redemption children.
3787,2020-09-06 18:44:18,inkwsy,"I thought the ""forced into it"" referred to being involved in Kendall & Kylie's lives, not forced into having them in the first place.  IIRC it was Cait who wanted more kids when she got together with Kris in the first place.

Some people want lots of kids because they see kids kind of like as property, but they're not interested in knowing their kids as people."
3788,2020-09-07 13:48:07,inkwsy,Parents who think like that aren’t rare and it’s honestly scary
3789,2020-09-06 20:12:28,inkwsy,Yeah but she’s sorta perpetuating sexist stereotypes. Womanhood isn’t makeup and being fashionably lste
3790,2020-09-06 20:02:47,inkwsy,"Yeah honestly I understand Cait's excitement because imagine societal expectations/shame preventing you from pursuing your passions for 60 years, watching your wealthy wife and stepdaughters flash the glitz and glam and luxury 24/7, and then suddenly this amazing world you've lusted after for decades is opened to you. 

However the underwear thing...that was just super inappropriate."
3791,2020-09-06 18:24:49,inkwsy,Yeah hahaha I'm such a dumb fuck
3792,2020-09-07 19:13:56,inkwsy,I also wanna know
3793,2020-09-06 14:39:14,inkwsy,"First of all, I love your user name. Secondly, I cannot agree with you more about this. It baffles me how many people simply forget that she killed someone."
3794,2020-09-06 14:03:41,inkwsy,Well this took a turn
3795,2020-09-06 16:44:29,inkwsy,"Ok I must be way out of the loop, but what murder??"
3796,2020-09-06 18:31:23,inkwsy,"the nazis persecuted and killed huge droves of LGBTQIA+ people, not just jewish folks. and most nazis alive today are not so fond of trans folks.... so why use that ignorant term against any trans person? just unnecessary. words mean things."
3797,2020-09-06 15:46:36,inkwsy,People are literally dying because of this neo nazi movement. It really is that deep. Some words shouldn't involve to have cute definitions.
3798,2020-09-06 16:13:35,inkwsy,It is that deep when people are getting killed by literal neonazis. Language matters. It’s really not that hard to be considerate.
3799,2020-09-06 17:07:20,inkwsy,"you sound like someone who is sheltered from the implicit consequences of the nazis uprising and that’s a bit... telling, luv. have a think on this take xx"
3800,2020-09-06 21:41:52,inkwsy,"Or 'brand whore' since it's more common, established slang"
3801,2020-09-06 19:49:19,inkwsy,I mean of course she's gonna say that...imagine if she said she always wanted 5 kids lmao
3802,2020-09-06 17:51:18,inkwsy,"Absolutely, she gave no fucks about Burt, Casey, or Brandon & Brody."
3803,2020-09-06 18:13:09,inkwsy,This is basically what she said in her book actually.
3804,2020-09-06 18:55:41,inkwsy,"Can confirm the second point, lowkey how my parents were to me. I’ve seen it happen with other families too. It fuckin sucks."
3805,2020-09-06 23:54:05,inkwsy,"But to her makeup and fashion are a part of her gender expression, she’s not saying you have to do this to be a woman. Most importantly if we’re going to critique this in Caitlyn then let’s bring the same energy for the rest of the Kardashian girls."
3806,2020-09-06 20:24:58,inkwsy,"i just don’t think she had any malicious intent with it. makeup and hair is something you can’t really do when you’re a man, but you can when you’re a woman. so it makes sense for her to be excited about that, rather than other aspects of being a woman. i mean... what else is there really lol?"
3807,2020-09-06 14:42:13,inkwsy,"Aha thank you! 

Yeah, same. Every time I see a caitlyn discussion I am floored by people who don’t remember that she drove recklessly and killed someone or they simply look past it."
3808,2020-09-06 14:06:28,inkwsy,It’s hard for me to have compassion for someone who clearly doesn’t have any for others.
3809,2020-09-06 17:49:55,inkwsy,It’s technically involuntary manslaughter. She didn’t murder anyone.
3810,2020-09-06 16:53:30,inkwsy,She was in a car accident where someone in another car died. I believe the family of the victim sued her.
3811,2020-09-07 00:00:58,inkwsy,👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
3812,2020-09-06 23:11:32,inkwsy,Poor Rob.
3813,2020-09-06 18:45:17,inkwsy,As evidenced by choosing the name Caitlin when Brody had been dating a Kaitlynn for years.
3814,2020-09-06 19:55:03,inkwsy,Damn I need to read all the books they’ve put out!
3815,2020-09-07 01:00:47,inkwsy,“Well it’s a woman’s prerogative to be fashionability late” you can’t tell me that’s not sexist!
3816,2020-09-06 21:03:22,inkwsy,"Not having malicious intent doesn’t absolve bad behaviours tho? I don’t know the answer to your last question but we shouldn’t excuse peoples sexist behaviours for any reason, even if they are a trans woman."
3817,2020-09-06 14:11:26,inkwsy,I think that’s fair but I do feel sorry that she lived her whole life as a lie. She clearly needed more help with her transition than she got.
3818,2020-09-06 17:58:56,inkwsy,Thank you. If we're gonna use legal terms we might as well do it correctly. She didn't plot a strangers murder and then intentionally kill them.
3819,2020-09-06 18:18:03,inkwsy,"Caitlyn paid them $800,000 after the crash and then SHE sued another driver claiming it was THEIR fault.. smh"
3820,2020-09-06 16:57:31,inkwsy,In my mind a car accident isn’t the same as how murdered is being used. She didn’t shoot someone or have mal intent. It was an accident. She just didn’t face any consequences because of money and fame.
3821,2020-09-09 03:29:08,inkwsy,Omg I just realized this...
3822,2020-09-07 03:08:38,inkwsy,That’s your hang up? A dumb joke she made because she was late? I can’t recall her making similar statements later on or developing a platform of women being late. I think when a woman makes these jokes it’s not the same as if a man does.
3823,2020-09-07 00:01:19,inkwsy,"I think it’s ridiculous to call her passion of hair and makeup sexist... she’s a woman. A woman who loves hair and makeup. She’s entitled to be excited about whatever excites her. Cait is a terrible human, but for OTHER reasons."
3824,2020-09-06 18:01:56,inkwsy,She was texting and speeding and went over multiple lanes... Ended up plowing right into a women in a car that was parked at a light and killed her. I'd say that was directly her fault and honestly not really an accident. Just absolute carelessness with no regard to the possible outcomes.
3825,2020-09-06 17:00:29,inkwsy,"The accident occurred because of Caitlyn’s speeding , swerving and texting, and reckless driving. Someone is still dead because of Caitlyn. 

I guess I don’t see how “she didn’t shoot someone” is relevant when someone is dead because Caitlyn was selfish and drove recklessly."
3826,2020-09-06 18:44:42,inkwsy,"Somebody lost her life due to her actions the same way someone would lose their life because of a shooter’s actions. Cars are a speeding hunk of metal that can hurt a lot of people when used improperly just like guns could. 

I don’t think the fact that a different “weapon” was used justifies not calling her a murderer cause... in the end she did take that woman’s life. That’s undeniable. And kind of what murder is, intentional or not."
3827,2020-09-07 04:34:52,inkwsy,"Yeah, it’s cringe and sexist. Boomer humour"
3828,2020-09-07 04:48:38,inkwsy,"exactly, it’s just a joke"
3829,2020-09-07 01:00:11,inkwsy,Umm when did I say liking hair and makeup is sexist.
3830,2020-09-07 01:34:10,inkwsy,You’re literally saying it is for cait lol

God gave me brown hair but it’s currently blue, nobody is giving me shit for that or calling me slurs for it. God gave us clear skin but we tattoo it, god gave us wonky noses but we get rhinoplasty. Your body is editable, transitioning from one gender to another is another way to change it to your liking. It’s so fucking stupid to say that god gave you a dick so you have to keep it, it doesn’t hold water if you look at it too close."

3846,2020-09-04 01:39:44,ilyf50,My favorite argument ive ever heard comes from my professor and I’m paraphrasing here but it was something along the lines with “if someone is born without a  leg and they get prosthetics to improve their quality of life are they ruining what god gave them? So why would changing gender to improve your quality of life be any different then someone without a hand or a leg using prosthetics”
3847,2020-09-03 18:00:36,ilyf50,"Caitlyn Jenner is a trans woman. While she was identifying as a man she went by Bruce Jenner and won an Olympic gold in the Decathlon event. In 2015 she came out as transgendered and it was somewhat controversial in its reception. The 2015 ESPY awards gave her an award of courage for her transition which is why this guy is upset apparently.

And screw all the animosity from some of the kardashians. it had to be so hard to become who she really wanted to be and for that, I couldn't really fucking respect."
3882,2020-08-31 21:59:38,ik60zn,"It's so funny to me that she used to be a super strong Olympic champion, and she did just a 180° turn.. love it
Also, how funny she chose a C for her name and not a K like the rest of the Klan
She is definitely my favourite of them all and they used to be sooo mean to her in the first seasons, like how Khloe almost didn't let her walk her down the aisle in Lamar and her wedding....
She is the best of them all and I feel like she was so despised by the original 3"

3886,2020-08-31 23:00:05,ik60zn,"Serious question that’s not really directed at Caitlyn, but something I’ve noticed on IG and never really had a place to ask -

Why is her clean face skin so much lighter than her neck? Does is have something to do beauty products (like using toner, serum, lotion, etc etc as a daily routine?). Is it bc of a spray tan?

I know our skin can just vary in tones but I feel like with celebs and MUAs I notice it a lot more. Just curious"
3887,2020-09-01 01:33:39,ik60zn,I don't even recognize her
3888,2020-09-02 06:27:28,ik60zn,Was that applause when she said her name?

3892,2020-09-01 07:06:31,ik60zn,This honestly is the opposite we get from kuwtk
3893,2020-09-01 02:11:45,ik60zn,"Yeah, after hearing Brody talk about how hurt he was after he was abandoned by Caitlin, I don’t respect her. And it never seemed Caitlin was genuinely sorry for wha happened. More like, well, it happened, let’s move on. Even though right after she came out and transitioned, her oldest kids were super supportive. They seemed to want to be there for her even though she was never there for them. The whole thing makes me feel sad for them."
3894,2020-09-01 00:45:40,ik60zn,"I recently thought about how much closer Kaitlyn seems to the youngest ones. I think there is definitely no excusing how she abandoned the other children, but I think was finally emotionally mature enough to at least raise kids by the time K+K came. Like it wasn't that she favored them, just that she was old enough and had perhaps accumulated enough regrets around parenting to actually stick around."
3895,2020-08-31 22:00:04,ik60zn,"I honestly think Kendall and Kylie fans. 
She’s plugging all their makeup products"
3896,2020-08-31 23:17:18,ik60zn,"Good question. I know her short lived series was boring as fuck and after that, I lost interest. I wonder if there are serious, die hard Caitlyn fans we know nothing about."
3897,2020-08-31 21:54:06,ik60zn,Good question... I don't know for sure. 🧐
3898,2020-08-31 22:05:01,ik60zn,"I wonder about the C/K thing sometimes. I imagine being suppressed as long as she was, I’m sure she spent so much time thinking about her name. I wonder if she imagined it as a K but when drama started going down, she was asked to change it to a C."
3899,2020-08-31 23:50:16,ik60zn,"I copiously apply multiple layers of high spf on my face and neck but often forget my body, and I run every other day, and use a lighter spray on my body because that's just what I have. I also love serums and peels. When I'm not wearing makeup, I look similar, haha."
3900,2020-08-31 23:24:28,ik60zn,Definitely spray tans or other tanning products. Typically people avoiding using those products on the face as the skin there is more sensitive and they can achieve the tanned looked with bronzer and foundation.
3901,2020-09-01 11:15:43,ik60zn,"It’s pretty common for the skin on your face to be lighter than on your body. I would dare to say most people’s are. (Especially women) Facial SPF, peeling/brightening products, exfoliation, no spray tan, even wearing make up which can protect you a little bit from the sun"
3902,2020-09-01 10:53:30,ik60zn,"beauty products can actually change skin tone. My body is pretty tanned rn and  myface was a bit less tanned as I'd been using spf and covering my face to not make things worse with my acne. Then I started using acid toner and my face now is as white as it usually gets during the winter. 

don't think it's Caitlyn case tho she's definitely not in her 20s to use products to prevent acne but anyways..."

3910,2020-08-31 23:36:23,ik60zn,"Gotcha. For a while I was worried it was a result of many years of facials, laser treatments, etc etc. but spray tans/tans makes sense!"

She was treated like shit on the show."

Eu chamo de loteria geográfica pois a mulher que nasce no ocidente bem mais sorte do que aquela que nasce no Oriente e quando substituíram a discussão séria sobre este assunto pelo desfile da identidade de gênero todos se afastaram ainda mais de encontrar uma solução.

Certa vez vi algo quando lia Dawkins, putz, ele mostrava mulheres jovens,, belas, com lingas pernas a caminho da Universidade. Eram do Oriente médio.

Eram os anos 70.

 Num intervalo de tempo ridículo, num piscar de olhos viraram cidadãs de segunda classe.

If you were already involved in the conversation, then you’re absolutely NTA for calling him out. Props to you for doing it!"
3949,2020-08-28 05:48:38,ii0exq,"Without context it's not possible to know if this was a jab at trans people or if this was new information to them. Finding something weird doesn't automatically mean prejudice. For all we know, maybe they've never heard of inner gender even being a thing and don't understand it, so it would be weird. Things not understood or not encountered often are weird. 

YTA Because you inserted yourself into a conversation that wasn't yours to butt into and because there is no context here as to the comment itself."

People can decide how they feel about that, but speaking up in those situations does not make you the asshole"

This happened 4 years ago.

I was 17F at the time, my younger sister was there and she and the other people involved thought I was the AH.

We were on the school bus heading home, my sister was next to me, and a friend and a stranger were sitting behind us. They were talking about KUWTK and he said that comment. I genuinely don't remember how I worded it. 

Our friend and the guy got off the bus shortly after and my sister and I got off after and walked home, and I wanted to resolve the situation so I posted a picture on Instagram and apologized, and our friend said it was alright, but I didn't  really think I did anything wrong.

(I've since moved states and the friend and I don't speak anymore, not because of this, we just grew apart\_.

3954,2020-08-28 08:27:42,ii0exq,"Depends entirely on context of them saying “weird”

If it was “weird” as in strange (or a complete shock) since they remember fondly Caitlyn as her former self, an Olympic athlete, then I would say YTA. Being shocked by a trans folks outing is still a thing, let alone when you least expect it. 

However, if they were saying “weird” in terms of undermining her existence, you’re definitely NTA. Doubting someone’s existence is just a dick move. Call it out when you see it."
3955,2020-08-28 04:30:51,ii0exq,NTA. i'm a trans person and i can 100% say that the comment was transphobic- your (presumably cis) sister and the others don't get to say you were in the wrong for calling him out.

3958,2020-08-28 06:09:25,ii0exq,"“That’s weird” is a pretty inoccuous phrase that varies a lot by context. “I listen to the Dresden Dolls on repeat.” “That’s weird.” It’s not fair to suggest that simply the words “that’s weird” imply prejudice. They really don’t. Unfortunately, transsexuality is pretty weird to most of society. That just means it’s unusual. But that doesn’t mean we don’t love you as a person and want you to be happy. You have to put the claws away. Lack of understanding =/= hatred. And acknowledgement of how unusual it is doesn’t even equal lack of understanding. It’s also such a small part of your personality as a whole"

4069,2020-08-23 17:40:29,iewkyz,"That laugh is classic. I'm sticking to my theory that Made is a sequel to Swingers. They're the same characters, but with Puff Daddy thrown in to the mix."
4070,2020-08-24 01:44:25,iewkyz,"I get that - but seriously, check out '[Hell of a Story](https://www.amazon.com/Kathy-Griffin-Hell-Story/dp/B07VVWGC85/)'. It will totally change your mind about her as a person."
4071,2020-08-24 22:21:53,iewkyz,"She tends to play ""annoying"" characters in various shows and films. That's kind of her thing. It's not who she is in real life.

It reminds me of Christopher Guest making a quip about how when people meet him, they expect him to crack a joke or just be ""funny."" When he has said he rarely jokes unless he's in front of a camera."
4072,2020-08-23 18:34:10,iewkyz,That's says more about you than her if anything.
4073,2020-08-23 13:47:40,iewkyz,"Ehh, not really.

Yeah he makes an ass out of himself on Twitter. But holding up a mock decapitated head covered in blood? Even Trump hasn't gone that low.

... yet."
4074,2020-08-23 16:13:41,iewkyz,"she had some good stand up, once upon a time"
4075,2020-08-23 11:31:07,iewkyz,I also choose this guy’s dead wife.
4076,2020-08-23 17:19:26,iewkyz,"""IT'S NOT A ZOMBIE MOVIE!!!""

\- A Lot of Salty, Zombie Movie Fans"
4077,2020-08-23 18:27:23,iewkyz,"George W. Bush. Ellen has been to a few events with him, I think? As a way of demonstrating how to ""bridge the political gap"" I'd imagine."
4078,2020-08-23 16:49:25,iewkyz,The privilege of being wealthy far overrides any oppression of being LGBT.
4079,2020-08-23 19:20:29,iewkyz,"Again, maybe in the 90s. Dude was in everything when I was growing up. Aaaand he was awesome in Swingers."
4080,2020-08-23 14:16:51,iewkyz,He mocked and mimed a disabled person on live tv
4081,2020-08-23 17:21:32,iewkyz,"He bragged about raping and sexually assaulting women.

He bragged he could murder people and get away with it.

He bragged about Michelle Obama *underselling* the amount of Americans he deliberately killed with his policies on COVID."
4082,2020-08-24 07:07:51,iewkyz,"I’m sure he wants to do that, but then he looks even more stupid"
4083,2020-08-23 14:06:40,iewkyz,Gotta catch 'em all!
4084,2020-08-23 15:17:32,iewkyz,"What about joe.     


Joe mama?

Edit.    Kiss is for people who cant keep up to acdcs three chords"
4085,2020-08-23 12:31:22,iewkyz,I was the bus driver

4088,2020-08-23 14:23:24,iewkyz,Thats definitely the same as holding up a head of the president of your country.

""Jack Mama."" -Beavis"
4090,2020-08-23 19:59:04,iewkyz,"People quote him everywhere though you motorboating son of a bitch.

I would definitely say he's iconic, at the very least he's so money and doesn't even know it."
4091,2020-08-23 14:33:47,iewkyz,Stop being a snowflake. IT WAS A JOKE.
4092,2020-08-23 17:21:56,iewkyz,Cool story [T_Dumbass](https://masstagger.com/user/HHIIIMM)
4093,2020-08-23 15:24:03,iewkyz,No. It’s much much worse.
4094,2020-08-23 20:59:11,iewkyz,"Exactly. I’m stoked, let’s kill some birds."
4095,2020-08-23 14:34:55,iewkyz,No it wasn't
4096,2020-08-23 17:24:48,iewkyz,Lol. You guys still don't see anything wrong that attacking people for having a different opinion to you?. And I'M the bad guy? Fucking hippocrates.
4097,2020-08-23 15:00:07,iewkyz,"You're definitely being a snowflake. Trump has ""joked"" about grabbing women by the pussy, Epstein's love for young girls, shooting someone in the middle of the streets of New York, disabled people, north Koreans, Arabs, people from shithole countries and I could keep going on and on and on and on. So trump and his supporters should learn to take a joke like he takes the piss from Russian prostitutes. I thought the decapitated head was.funng as hell if only because of how triggered they all got because of it. This is America, freedom of speech is alive and well. 

People spent all 8 years of Obama's presidency ""joking"" about how he's a Muslim, a terrorist, communist, how they wish he was dead, etc.. no one batted an eye then. Don't be so sensitive"
4098,2020-08-23 14:57:28,iewkyz,"Damn, snowflake really is the right word.. it is all about projection.  Kinda always amazes me.   Just so shallow and predictable."
4099,2020-08-23 15:00:07,iewkyz,"You got all of that from ""No it wasn't""?. Thats impressive."

4110,2020-10-10 15:53:05,j8jssi,"[RHOD’s Brandi Redmond Reveals Daughter, 9, Survived Car Crash that Killed Her Mother-in-Law](https://people.com/tv/brandi-redmond-daughter-survives-car-crash-killed-mother-in-law/)  (people.com)  

Brandi Redmond is mourning the loss of her mother-in-law.

The *Real Housewives of Dallas* star, 42, revealed on Saturday that her mother-in-law Jill Marie Redmond died in a car crash. Although the reality star’s daughter Brinkley, who turned 9 earlier this month, was in the car at the time of the crash, she survived the impact.

“My husbands beautiful mom has gone on to be with our Savior and my sister in laws said it best...so I PLEASE ask that you keep my family in your prayers during this difficult time,” she [wrote](https://www.instagram.com/p/CGJmTAjHlKZ/) on Instagram Saturday, alongside a series of family photographs.

Although Brandi did not share any details about her daughter’s injuries, she asked her followers to keep Brinkley in their thoughts.

“I ask that you lift my sweet Brinkley up as she continues to heal and that God protects her heart and eyes from this tragedy,” she wrote. “I am so thankful for her life. This is probably the most thankful yet pain I’ve ever felt.” 

In addition to her own message, Brandi also shared an emotional note from her sisters-in-law.

“This is our mom, Jill Marie Redmond. We spoke to her daily. To speak of her in past tense hurts beyond words. Hours ago we lost her in a tragic car accident. Thank you, Jesus, for saving our niece who was in the car with her,” her husband Bryan's three sisters [wrote](https://www.instagram.com/p/CGJmTAjHlKZ/).

“To know our mom was to love her. She was a shining light to all who were lucky enough to know her. She loved so fiercely. She felt so deeply. And she loved Jesus with all her heart. Her world was FAMILY. She loved her 4 children and many grand babies to the depths of her soul, and she left us doing what she loved most- caring for her grand babies. We are in shock and are experiencing an indescribable pain,” they added. “In our mom’s honor, if you have a living parent please tell them how much you love and appreciate them, and hug your loved ones extra tight tonight and always. We love you. Shine bright and spread love and kindness.” 

A week before the crash, Brinkley celebrated her latest birthday.

“Happy 9th Birthday brinkley\_\_redmond,” her mother wrote in a loving Instagram tribute. “You are my sunshine. I love you so so so much and can’t believe 9 years have already gone by.”

“Thank you for your sweet gentle soul that loves life to the fullest. You are EVERYTHING and I am so blessed to call you my daughter. Hope today and everyday is filled with love laughter and blessings,” she added.

Brandi shares three children, daughters Brooklyn, 11, and Brinkley as well as 2-year-old son Bruin, with her husband Bryan."
4111,2020-10-10 14:37:13,j8jssi,"Monique: I feel remorse for what I did.

Also Monique: Candiace pushed me to do it.

Monique again: I still think Candiace threw a wine glass at me.

She is not sorry, at all."
4112,2020-10-10 13:48:59,j8jssi,Porsha is either unbothered by these false rumours or unbothered by this true story. https://www.instagram.com/p/CGI6nkknkwH/?igshid=mj6snw3kcb4d
4113,2020-10-10 12:52:51,j8jssi,"Monique... sounds legitimately insane in this interview. She is doing herself NO favours, every time she opens her mouth she digs the hole deeper. Maybe don't say Candiace ""egged you on"" and refer to it as a ""pounding"" in the same breath you say you're remorseful, just a suggestion! Lolll Candiace: ""\[The reunion\] will be the only time I ever speak with her or allow myself to be around someone like her again. It's only because I want to hear how she's finally going to put the last spin on the lies she's created over the last year."" I am honestly so excited for this reunion it's going to be a beautiful disaster.

Omg seeing Candiace cry is BREAKING MY HEART I love her so much I just want to hug her. I'm disappointed in Karen too, Robyn! I expected this from Ashley, but I expected more from Karen. WOAH, Karen told Candiace to press charges? Didn't see that coming. That cameo Candiace made is such a delight. I'm getting one for myself for Chanukah I just decided IDGAF lol.

ASSISTANT MATTTT I get so fucking happy every time I see him. Love you Matt Byars.

Is there such a thing as a housewife who is a ""shrinking violet,"" Andy? Not one that lasts more than one season!

Cynthia shouted out Kenya Moore Hair Care! Maybe she and Kenya are on good terms?

I love that Vicki interview so much that I insisted on doing a dramatic reading of it for mrreadingrachelx last night after several glasses of wine but it took like 15 minutes because I kept having to stop and laugh like a donkey every time I read out another sentence.

Lolll Elizabeth's brother! Oh I love a rogue family member, this is promising. Does she know he's doing interviews with small local publications where they grew up and saying her Bravo bio contains lies!?!? Dead.

When I hear Braunwyn say she's not speaking to her castmates all I hear is ""this reunion is gonna be good.""

I wish Garcelle the best of luck on her continued journey to elevate the housewives. Many before her have tried and failed lol. How would the alleged new housewife know she’s descended from Confucius? He died in 479 BC. Kooky, I like it!"
4114,2020-10-10 15:28:46,j8jssi,"I thought to myself “oh Monique is back peddling....wait no she’s not...wait” like 5 times reading this lol she is really going off the rails. Candiace is so intelligent she effortlessly makes Monique look like a fool tbh. Also Vicki: “love, your former tres amiga” ☠️😭"
4115,2020-10-10 13:29:57,j8jssi,"I’m watching the s7 Atlantic city episode of RHONY and my g-d it’s so good. Bethenny trying to tell Sonja she sounds name-droppy and pretentious - Sonja, nods “because they didn’t live the life.”"
4116,2020-10-10 14:39:53,j8jssi,Her story is all over the place so much so that it’s starting to make me lol every time she gives another interview. This has been a wild ride.
4117,2020-10-10 13:51:12,j8jssi,Lollll Porsha. That’s the exact right attitude and if Denise had just done the same she could have avoided a lot of grief from the other ladies this season. You gotta laugh at yourself before everyone else can! One of the secrets of life!
4118,2020-10-10 15:31:49,j8jssi,I will never again be able to look at Gina and Emily without thinking of them as “the miscasting decisions” (even though I like Gina as a hw).
4119,2020-10-10 13:48:52,j8jssi,The elevator doors trying to close on Ramonja as they made a beeline for the club 💀
4120,2020-10-10 14:44:08,j8jssi,She needs to stop talking at this point!
4121,2020-10-10 16:04:34,j8jssi,"I like them both too but, truly, Vicki hit the nail on the head lmfao"
4122,2020-10-10 14:46:18,j8jssi,"For her own sake, absolutely, yes. For our entertainment, no. Also the Candiace victim-blaming is ongoing so I’m happy for Monique to continue to bury herself leading up to the reunion. Candiace is going to run verbal circles around her."
4123,2020-10-10 16:05:45,j8jssi,Vicki is fucking hilarious. I think I could grow to like Emily as a hw if she’d lean more into her anger problems onscreen. I see villain potential in her but she brings nothing rn IMO.
4124,2020-10-10 15:05:26,j8jssi,Oh I can’t wait to see Candiace take her down at the reunion!
4125,2020-10-10 18:42:15,j8jssi,"I like Emily, and especially like the “THATS MY HUSBAND.....I WILL FUCKING KILL YOU” Emily lmfao. I wanted her to keep that same energy into each season 🤪 but truly I just think she’s a good/normal person at heart, maybe too much so for housewives lol"
4126,2020-10-10 20:43:31,j8jssi,"Oh I don’t lol, Emily is a Trumper and qanon-er, she’s nuts, and I wanna see it onscreen or she can make way for someone who will properly bring the kookery! Lol"
4127,2020-10-10 23:09:11,j8jssi,Ugh not another one... I’m disappointed actually what is up with these housewives and this qanon shit???
4128,2020-10-10 23:12:32,j8jssi,"It seems especially bad in the OC, a LOT of them are into it there. Also I always remember when Gina revealed Emily sent a text meant for Shane to her MIL by mistake that was so mean that her MIL didn’t talk to her for two months. I wanna see THAT Emily!!"
4129,2020-10-09 23:50:42,j8a50t,Why is Caitlyn Jenner on a comedy show?
4130,2020-10-10 00:51:08,j8a50t,Bert is such a fucking hack. This is unbearable to watch. He should get the Delia treatment simply for how bad this is
4131,2020-10-10 01:45:00,j8a50t,im torn between downvoting this post because i have never liked bert kreischer or upvoting it so people can see how terrible this is
4132,2020-10-10 00:34:44,j8a50t,"Ok so I don’t care about Jenner, who should have gone to jail for reckless driving, but content like this is repulsive. It’s no different than watching Jersey Shore or The Bachelor."
4133,2020-10-10 01:15:59,j8a50t,That's so bad...
4134,2020-10-10 23:34:38,j8a50t,I will never understand people who think Bert is funny: he’s way over the top and forces the feeling way to much.
4135,2020-10-10 17:57:39,j8a50t,This is Hollywood at its finest.  Fake and crazy narcissistic.
4136,2020-10-11 00:47:39,j8a50t,I hung in there for 43 seconds.
4137,2020-10-12 08:54:13,j8a50t,Its like the ranch meets the view
4138,2020-10-10 09:15:53,j8a50t,On a scale of 1 to Brendan Schaub’s Comedy Special what would this be rated?
4139,2020-10-10 01:28:36,j8a50t,"(Pronoun) can't at least fake a lady voice?
F"
4140,2020-10-10 01:10:18,j8a50t,A lot of channel executives on here but none of them have any money.
4141,2020-10-10 06:42:48,j8a50t,Burn Crysler is more of a fame seeker than comedian. I prefer Brendan Schawb over Crysler at least you get to laugh when (at) Schweeb when he speaks
4142,2020-10-10 10:26:20,j8a50t,It's really not that bad
4143,2020-10-10 13:50:40,j8a50t,Now That's Some Real Selling Out
4144,2020-10-10 22:40:33,j8a50t,"“That’s bringing em up right baybee”

Kyle?"
4145,2020-10-11 02:34:00,j8a50t,Bert has never been right after getting his drink spiked.
4146,2020-10-10 14:44:49,j8a50t,Another show where Bert can lie excessively and no one will call him out on it
4147,2020-10-10 00:27:56,j8a50t,[deleted]
4148,2020-10-10 16:01:32,j8a50t,"Zzzz. 
Bert's good comedian friends don't bother with this kind of work for obvious reasons."
4149,2020-10-09 23:59:23,j8a50t,"Surprise
“Anatomical man prefers women over other man”

This is such modern day the simple life
Bert really sold his man card for this shit"
4150,2020-10-09 23:53:30,j8a50t,Is this suppose to be a comedy? I couldn’t tell from whatever that was I just watched
4151,2020-10-10 15:42:46,j8a50t,She trades handjob techniniques with Bert and hilarity ensues .... Or at least thats how they envisioned it
4152,2020-10-11 11:31:21,j8a50t,Why is Bert Kreisher on a comedy show?

Okay I'll introduce everyone that is relevant

Me - Me

F1: Friend who made ""offensive"" joke

F2: Friend who found said joke ""offensive""

&#x200B;

OK so my friends were chilling at lunch time and F1 (keep in mind is a massive Chad and tons of girls love him) had a not so great looking girl walk up to him and asked him if they wanted to hang out. He politely declined, and as soon as she was out of earshot F1 said, ""Gross, she looks worse than Caitlyn Jenner"". All of our friends started laughing, but F2 was silent then said. ""Wow since when was transphobia and body shaming funny"". F2 went on a semi-rant about how we need to ""stop normalizing this behavior and how we need to empower girls yada yada"". At the end I just said, ""jesus man you're such a basement dweller"". F2 just stood up and left the room, left the group chat and didn't participate in the Clan War that night. We domoted them and started texting them about how F2 needs to chill out and we can be friends again. F1 got reprimanded by having to donate more diamonds to F2 on our minecraft server and got demoted in Clash of Clans.

In my opinion I made no mistake.

Did I say it yet? Let me say it louder:  YTA YTA YTA!

Here is the thing: you are acting like a jerk, and you know it, and when a friend made you feel bad about it, you penalized him? 

Jokes at other people’s expense are not jokes. They are basically a flex on supremacy (as in, you clearly think you are better than the target of a joke).

I have absolutely no idea why I’m bothering to write this out. If you didn’t listen to your “friend” (not a real friend by the way you treat him), you certainly are not going to listen to Reddit.

4236,2020-10-07 23:24:53,j70g5f,"1. Trans men tend to pass better and are less likely to be noted as trans.
2. There actually are just more trans women in the general public (by about 3:2) Though, that ratio keeps getting smaller and smaller.
3. Historical trans men often have their stories sold as ""woman disguises as a man to make it in a man's world."" and as such, people like Dr James Barry, who lived as a man his entire life from age 20, and kept living as a man in retirement and ordered that his body never be examined, are not on that list."
4237,2020-10-07 23:44:01,j70g5f,"There are more trans women than men because trans guys disappear into the world easily.

It's not shameful for a ""girl"" to ""dress like a boy"". That's just being a tomboy. But a ""boy"" going and ""dressing like a girl""? That's shamed in some areas. Societally, trans men (and those struggles of being trans) are sort of...buried. And so we are never seen, whether by Wikipedia or the media or even in this sub: it's predominantly trans women and femme people, after all.

I believe that, as time goes on, we are getting closer and closer to equality for all genders and seeing all genders. Not one struggles more than the other, nor does one pass better than the others. I think that society is changing to stop shaming people and start seeing them for who they are...

Those are my guesses, though."

4240,2020-10-05 13:02:10,j5htlw,"Your post is reasonable and I can see the logic behind your statements. The only trans characters in the show are inaccurate stereotypes that are used as punchlines. The perspective I'd like to offer is that South Park always does that with topics, and that is where most of the comedy comes from. South Park is meant to be comedic, offensive, and silly; accurate representation is not high on the list. 

>having at least one normal trans character in the show

There are literally no normal characters on the show (especially adults). Everyone is a complete idiot and bad person. The representation is supposed to be of the most outrageous case. Your example of Mr(s) Garrison shows this. It's unfortunate that he/she became your representation of trans people, but it shouldn't have been, because Garrison is a fucked up psycho, trans or not. Same thing with the gamer guy in the warcraft episode. Clearly that's the worst version of those guys. 

Part of what makes the comedy so strong in South Park is that it mocks people for offensive reasons. Plenty of people don't watch because it offends them, like Christians, gamers, Asians, Canadians, parents, doctors, cops, trans people, Mormons, the disabled, homosexuals and Tom Cruise.

I'm happy to hear you still like the show, and I hope you can find other media, and people, that support your transition in a positive way."
4241,2020-10-05 13:09:31,j5htlw,"I appreciate your perspective! Very interesting 

This isn't a fully-baked thought but... It seems to me South Park has a way of portraying a person/lifestyle in the most crude & disrespectful way possible, in an attempt to mock the people who would make fun of that person/lifestyle irl (in this case, transphobes). But it's a very clumsy approach because then viewers who miss the nuance come away with ""haha yeah South Park thinks transgender people are ridiculous just like me."" Know what I mean?"

4260,2020-10-03 19:13:38,j4kaij,Melanie looks pissed off all the time. She has RBF. Resting B**ch Face.

4265,2020-10-02 21:45:21,j41dhf,There are more to come!
4266,2020-10-02 13:17:06,j3u5eu,"I'm ready to spew my daily un-asked for opinions! lol.

Erika is sooo pretty I love love love it (Teresa voice)

Andy saying ""the call is coming from inside the house"" re: Caitlyn made me giggle. I believe they call that the Tori Spelling Method of trying to get a diamond, and I don't believe it's ever worked for anyone before, but I'll give it up to her for trying.

Teddi: ""I filmed SO MUCH interesting footage, they just didn't show it!"" Lol I'm sorry Teddi I always feel bad joining in the pile on but COME. ON.

Sutton's online shop looks very professional, good for her. Seems she has some real business acumen. I like a lot of the pieces, she has a good eye if she's choosing this stuff herself.

Paging u/basilgavin we gotta tackle these next two together. Ok, first up, Ramona and Dorinda. Don't hate me for saying this u/basilgavin but I'm giggling so hard that D is still poking at Ramona and making things difficult for her even though she's off the show. But you and I can still be friends, right, even if Ramona and Dorinda can't (at least until season 14 when Dorinda gets asked back and they make up)? Next up, BETHENNY!!! Oh my G-D you insufferable woman! Bethenny: ""I’m no stranger to an Hermes\_Paris bag & have a daughter & luxury cars, but flaunting(under the guise of a back to school post)during a pandemic & the greatest unemployment crisis in our lifetime is a choice.” BETHENNY YOU ARE FLAUNTING THE SHIT YOU HAVE WHILST SHAMING SOMEONE ELSE FOR DOING THE SAME HOW UNSELFAWARE ARE YOU WOW BETHENNY WOW.

I thought Dorinda was going to officiate Kelly's wedding :( I guess not lol.

NeNe: ""Andy is a racist monster, and I hope to return to Bravo one day."" LOL. I don't happen to think Andy is a particularly good person or anything so I don't care when NeNe pokes at him but this tactic is hilarious to me given that she seems to want to still work for the network one day."
4267,2020-10-02 14:35:20,j3u5eu,"I know I am turning into a deranged Bethenny hater here but why is everything she says so obnoxious and lacking so much self awareness????????????

And people are excusing her own spoiling her daughter and living with her extreme wealth because of her charity. This is it folks!!! This is why I nag on her charity whenever possible. Nobody should be happy with the wealth gap just because rich people toss out a few crumbs!! It's certainly not her money she's spending on bstrong."
4268,2020-10-02 14:44:00,j3u5eu,"Sutton’s store has some really nice things in it.   I’m more of a bookworm and she has some beautiful coffee table books.  

Thanks for these daily updates, they have been making my mornings!"
4269,2020-10-02 18:57:39,j3u5eu,"1) Bethenny is my girl but that comment is dumb as hell. Who is she to talk?!?

2) Not Kelly making masks for her wedding when she’s  Bravo’s biggest Covid denier 💀

3) What is Nene talking about? Like actually? This entire campaign is very scattered and confusing and is messing with whatever legacy she has left. And all because of Wendy Williams?!? She should have stopped with the YouTube video. 

4) No idea why Dorinda is rubbing salt in this wound BUT if by chance they give her an appearance or two next season, watching Ramona lose it will be worth it!

5) “The People” clearly haven’t seen Potomac if they’re nominating RHOA and RHOBH who both had weak seasons!"
4270,2020-10-02 20:24:19,j3u5eu,odds that bethenny sends bryn to school with a skinnygirl backpack?
4271,2020-10-02 17:24:18,j3u5eu,Bethenny is so annoying my god. All she ever does is flaunt her wealth! Do we really think Bryn isn't wearing designer outfits? Of course she is. The only reason Bethenny doesn't show off about that is because she isn't legally allowed to
4272,2020-10-02 18:38:00,j3u5eu,"I started RHONY again from season 5 because Heather’s podcast with Carole made me nostalgic and knowing that Heather truly had no idea what she was doing while Ramona all but ate her alive makes it that much more enjoyable. Ramona’s testing you, Heather! You gotta be able to dish it back! Like for instance “what other tricks do you have to pull out of your Pinot-filled hat?”"
4273,2020-10-02 14:07:23,j3u5eu,I really love that le corset clutch Sutton gave Dorit.
4274,2020-10-02 14:44:08,j3u5eu,"Ramona generally deserves to be mocked and one of my favourite things about her is that she can ~~always~~ ~~usually~~ ~~often~~ sometimes laugh along, so I have no real issues with anyone coming for her! What I will say about this particular meme that more than one person sent me on Instagram in the past 24 hours is: who is the butt of the joke here? Dorinda clearly thinks it's Ramona, but if you look at who still has a job and who no longer has a job, isn't the one person truly getting owned here....Biden? Dorinda (and all of us) should be hoping against all hope that Biden doesn't suffer the same fate that she has.

Bethenny....I read your comment before I read the full story and I assumed your quote was paraphrasing/mocking her. As always, I could casually laugh at her cluelessness if her fanbase wasn't so up her ass that they'll praise her for this."
4275,2020-10-02 18:50:15,j3u5eu,I hate joining the pile-on too but I really cannot stand Teddi. Her saying the stuff that makes her look like a decent person was cut out made me laugh.
4276,2020-10-02 14:37:43,j3u5eu,"See this is another example of why it's Bethenny's public reception that makes me dislike her more. If everyone could just collectively be like ""lol fuck off, you're delusional"" I could find her lack of self awareness amusing. Instead she has sycophants defending her every obtuse statement!!"
4277,2020-10-02 14:38:11,j3u5eu,"When I was reading that story I flew into such an insane blind rage that I almost wanted to pre-prepare my own commentary BEFORE I hit post on the highlights because I didn’t want her to have one second of airtime unaccompanied by me pointing out her hypocrisy. THAT’S how petty she makes me feel 😂. It wouldn’t even bother me if people could see the humour in it but everyone is like YEAH BETHENNY IS SO RIGHT SHAME ON KYLIE! As you know I once made a donation to B Strong 😂 don’t judge me too harshly, I wouldn’t do it again."
4278,2020-10-02 14:46:38,j3u5eu,"From one bookworm to another (my username is a nod to Reading Rainbow 😊), I agree wholeheartedly! Her things are all a little bit unique too they’re not generic. It’s my absolute pleasure, I am so glad you enjoy ❤️"
4279,2020-10-02 19:01:08,j3u5eu,“bravo’s biggest covid denier” 💀. Where’s THAT people’s choice award category???
4280,2020-10-02 20:25:24,j3u5eu,About as likely as Ramona placing a drink order that takes fewer than 30 seconds to orate.
4281,2020-10-02 17:34:54,j3u5eu,I hope Kylie Jenner tweets at her to fuck off or something 😂 that would be too good
4282,2020-10-02 22:05:30,j3u5eu,The producer who sent Ramona and Aviva shoe shopping together is a goddamn genius
4283,2020-10-02 14:08:28,j3u5eu,Sutton has REALLY cool taste. Even bringing the bottle of Fireball to Kyle’s house was cool and memorable lol. I can’t wait to see her up her glam next season.
4284,2020-10-02 14:49:15,j3u5eu,"Lolllll good point, Dorinda played herself! I'm VERY over all the ""the debate was like a housewife reunion!"" and ""Andy Cohen should moderate!"" jokes on Twitter. I'm having trouble seeing the humour in any of this RN.

Lmao Bethenny ""fuck Kylie for having an Hermes - here's MY Hermes!"""
4285,2020-10-02 18:52:06,j3u5eu,😂😂😂 she dissed herself lmao. You just know Dorit is soooo happy she doesn’t have to deal with her anymore.
4286,2020-10-02 22:27:40,j3u5eu,"Reasons I relate to Carole:

Doesn’t like kid talk

Didn’t want to stand up and say what she liked about Yummie Tummie

Doesn’t need anyone to accompany her to the bathroom"
4287,2020-10-02 14:56:27,j3u5eu,"I like the stuff she wears. It’s not something I would wear/my taste but I enjoy looking at it. I get some people don’t like D&G bc they’re problematic, but I also see a lot of people say she has awful taste. And it always makes me wonder what their clothes are like lol."
4288,2020-10-02 23:15:27,j3u5eu,"Things Lu is better at than Carole:

Wearing capes

Playing croquet

Being royal

Gymnastics

Softball

Writing books

Being ruthless

Being self aware"
4289,2020-10-02 14:58:35,j3u5eu,Literally pretty much everything about hws and definitely about extreme wealth is problematic 😂 so if Sutton wants to wear D&G she should go right ahead lol I don’t expect ethical fashion choices from hws in any sense of the word 😂. I like Sutton’s clothes because they’re interesting. I like to be surprised. And I can’t not be tickled by a grown woman who loves herself a tiara 😂
4290,2020-10-02 15:20:21,j3u5eu,Oh I love a good tiara. I take out my wedding tiara and wear it every once in awhile just for fun.
4291,2020-10-02 15:21:45,j3u5eu,❤️❤️❤️👑👑👑
4292,2020-10-02 02:23:45,j3ft6q,I read on Twitter that they started this rumor themselves. Which makes sense.
4293,2020-10-02 00:14:48,j3ft6q,"According to Andy? ""According to real life"" is more like it. Of course they're not joining, my God. If E! (of all networks) couldn't keep I Am Cait, who would want her on this show?

(Don't have a problem with them being guests though)."
4294,2020-10-01 23:40:15,j3ft6q,Enough of the Jenner/Kardashian thing. They already have a show that I don't watch.
4295,2020-10-02 02:37:48,j3ft6q, No duh.
4296,2020-10-01 20:01:06,j3ft6q,"Oh, thank the lawd! 

I honestly would like someone fresh - I need a Jenner and Kardashian free show, so I’m happy."
4297,2020-10-02 02:25:51,j3ft6q,Whew!
4298,2020-10-02 06:10:18,j3ft6q,"Thank god, I mean how unglamorous would that be?"
4299,2020-10-02 15:17:51,j3ft6q,Thank God. I much prefer stinking rich nobodies compared to been-there-done-that celebrities looking for even more fame.
4300,2020-10-02 16:26:47,j3ft6q,"I am all for a trans woman joining the show!  But not Caitlyn.  Glad she is not a viable option.  Bring on a cool one!  

There are plenty posting right here on Reddit!  I learned a lot from one.  I had little knowledge of their lives and the tough decisions she made.  Why not find a Trans woman who is thrilled with her new life and successful in her world.  It would be an amazing way to open eyes.  Enough with the bitter angry types, who threaten to use the ‘tranny card’ (disgusting and cost her her job! Right Billy?). And Caitlyn shit all over every wife and any child he has.  He abandoned his kids and wives to move on to another woman to lie to and humiliate."
4301,2020-10-02 14:31:38,j3ft6q,Thank god!!! I would definitely watch Kris Jenner on there just to see her get messy drunk & try become one of the wives managers 🤣
4302,2020-10-02 17:03:17,j3ft6q,"Can I just say how happy I am that this thread is free of dead naming and mis-gendering! The Sub That Shall Not Be Named has a thread on this and it has numerous comments dead naming Cait and mis-gendering her. Even if talking about her in the past pre-transition, the most acceptable way to refer to her is using her current name and pronouns. I'm surprised with how heavy that sub is moderated they haven't done anything about those comments. And they're upvoted too, that's pretty sad for a sub full of people who think they're progressive."
4303,2020-10-02 12:32:29,j3ft6q,Good
4304,2020-10-02 04:24:18,j3ft6q,Bahaha! My supsicions confirmed!
4305,2020-10-02 01:29:06,j3ft6q,It's finally over this year
4306,2020-10-01 20:08:30,j3ft6q,"I agree. Let's go with someone who is not always in the news, someone we can learn about through the season. I think that is why Sutton has some appeal for me. I didn't know anything about her. I want to know more about her snarky Southern mother."
4307,2020-10-01 20:01:18,j3ft6q,"No, thank me instead!"
4308,2020-10-01 20:11:46,j3ft6q,"I totally agree. 

We’ve seen every angle of that family and it’s over done. I don’t watch Kardashians and I would hate to stop watching BH because they’ve turned it into a farce. 

I love Sutton and you’re right, she’s fresh and different and I want to find out more about her. We need more different personalities, rather than all clones."
4309,2020-10-01 20:09:53,j3ft6q,Good bot
4310,2020-10-02 00:08:56,j3ft6q,I agree. I don't want to see that family. RHOBH already has a problem with manufacturing stories.
4311,2020-10-02 09:36:38,j3ft6q,"Yeah, being someone in who’s exciting, we know nothing about and then we find out their story. We find out about their family, scandals, etc. 

I don’t want to google and have everything down to knicker size on hand."
4312,2020-10-01 18:05:01,j3dpzm,Oh thank god
4313,2020-10-01 18:12:46,j3dpzm,Thank you poppaaaa

4316,2020-10-01 18:28:16,j3dpzm,Good. Caitlyn was boring when she had her own show I can't imagine she would be that interesting as a housewife.
4317,2020-10-01 19:49:48,j3dpzm,Yea these rumors were def all planted by Caitlyn to try to remain relevant lol.
4318,2020-10-01 20:21:53,j3dpzm,"I saw some KUWTK and something that stood out to me was how often and strictly Caitlyn then as Bruce, referred and adhered to traditional male and female roles"
4319,2020-10-01 18:27:38,j3dpzm,I hope none of the cast rumors are true.
4320,2020-10-01 20:15:38,j3dpzm,This is the next best news after Teddi getting fired
4321,2020-10-01 18:42:29,j3dpzm,Sophia is beyond THIRSTY!
4322,2020-10-01 19:26:35,j3dpzm,He sounds soooo not interested in them. Good.
4323,2020-10-01 21:28:25,j3dpzm,I'm shocked. The rumors seemed totally legitimate and not at all like Caitlin and Sophia looking for attention.
4324,2020-10-01 22:53:39,j3dpzm,“The calls are coming from inside the house” lololol
4325,2020-10-01 18:33:40,j3dpzm,That would be awful
4326,2020-10-01 21:22:53,j3dpzm,Thank god for small miracles
4327,2020-10-01 21:06:33,j3dpzm,Good. We don't need a murderer on the cast.
4328,2020-10-02 02:11:45,j3dpzm,I don't think he would want it. I think he knows Caitlyn is a POS and he didn't stand for it.
4329,2020-10-02 04:55:56,j3dpzm,How old is this photo of him?
4330,2020-10-02 12:40:28,j3dpzm,I would feel mega betrayed if this were true. TF it ain’t
4331,2020-10-03 03:33:37,j3dpzm,Thank fucking God!
4332,2020-10-01 18:38:16,j3dpzm,Idk I thought Caitlyn could bring Camille season 1 energy

4337,2020-10-03 14:15:24,j3dpzm,It seems a lot of the gay community doesn't care for her.Ellen was talking about it a couple years ago on Howard Stern.Caitylin is against gay marriage and conservative.Caitlyn was also responsible for someone's death in a car accident before she transitioned
4338,2020-10-02 03:29:33,j3dpzm,Yeah from what I remember he doesn’t like her..
4339,2020-10-02 02:55:51,j3dpzm,Bruce was boring too

4349,2020-10-01 19:33:48,j3dpzm,A lot more than the “allowance” Bruce got during the marriage.

Even though the divorce was before she came out as trans, you should still use the appropriate pronouns."
4352,2020-10-02 21:28:07,j3dpzm,"Thanks! I'm sure Kris is sitting on a mountain of gold like a gd dragon, but I guess she protected her assets (I'm convinced it's way more than $60mil). Probably got a postnup once she became a 'momager'."
4353,2020-10-02 19:56:04,j3dpzm,Agreed. That was a mistake and not an intentional slight at Caitlin.
4354,2020-09-30 16:29:45,j2peuy,I’m all for adding trans representation to the HW franchise. But can’t we do better than Caitlin Jenner? She’s a terrible person who’s killed people. Please let this be a rumor.
4355,2020-09-30 03:39:37,j2eny6,"Well, it is 2020.

That tracks."
4356,2020-09-30 03:44:08,j2eny6,No. No Kardashian/Jenners. Or any other celebrity.

Yeah I should probably delete the post. I didn’t realize it had been posted in here several times before. I just read the page six article a couple hours ago so I was out of the loop. It’s not Caitlyn that wants to do the show, I guess his friend/roommate/manager wants to do the show and Caitlyn would do appearances. That was the gossip I read. I hate being behind of all the good gossip true or not true. 😂"
4372,2020-09-30 05:11:46,j2eny6,I would actually love that.
4373,2020-09-30 03:47:58,j2eny6,I think caitlyn just knows how to get people talking after the kris Jenner rumors on it. It was on dailymail/perez/shaderoom a few days ago so if it was attention she got what she wanted lol

4378,2020-09-29 15:16:54,j210vq,"Nope, that will be it for me."
4379,2020-09-29 15:20:19,j210vq,Make it (this rumor) stop
4380,2020-09-29 15:09:49,j210vq,Caitlyn Jenner on RHOBH sounds... so *fucking* stupid. lol
4381,2020-09-28 22:19:05,j1lwt4,One post had already been nuked for transphobia. Keep it civil.
4382,2020-09-28 22:26:56,j1lwt4,"I’m all for more trans people on tv, I just don’t think it’s her. Can we move on from this family already? I hope it’s just a rumor."
4383,2020-09-28 22:58:18,j1lwt4,"Caitlyn was the worst one on the Kardashians. Mean spirited, didn't ever want to do anything, lots of whining about pointless shit.

Caitlyn's own reality show didn't even work out.

She just isn't very likable.

Disclaimer: in no way am I saying she isn't likeable because she is transgender. Just in case someone takes it that way."
4384,2020-09-29 04:31:29,j1lwt4,That was would be quite 2020 to think we were getting Kris Jenner and ending up with Caitlyn Jenner.
4385,2020-09-28 22:25:10,j1lwt4,Automatic delete DVR that happens... bad enough last season ridiculous storylines
4386,2020-09-29 20:37:12,j1lwt4,Seeing Caitlin Jenner and Kim Richards on screen would be like eating 20 warhead candies
4387,2020-09-28 22:06:47,j1lwt4,"Idk if it’s official yet, but dear lord I hope they don’t hire that woman."
4388,2020-09-28 22:12:45,j1lwt4,The gossip insta deauxmoi just shared a post from somebody with a Bravo connect saying its completely madeup (thank god)
4389,2020-09-29 05:24:05,j1lwt4,"Barf. Caitlyn cannot even get along with her own daughters.

This is still speculation and not confirmed though:

4390,2020-09-28 23:37:21,j1lwt4,"I hope she really is ""apart"" of it"
4391,2020-09-29 20:03:35,j1lwt4,"I would stop watching. I’ve no interest in watching that family. Any of them. 

The storylines would be worse than they are now. No."
4392,2020-09-29 20:58:11,j1lwt4,But she killed someone.
4393,2020-09-28 23:01:22,j1lwt4,That has to be fake?
4394,2020-09-30 05:10:51,j1lwt4,"this is definitely not official, and in my opinion will never be official"
4395,2020-09-28 23:06:21,j1lwt4,There would be Kyle drama though since she is close with Kris Jenner

4397,2020-09-28 22:11:10,j1lwt4,I thought she wanted to be but they hadn’t agreed. I am not watching any show with one of those family members as a main “character”
4398,2020-09-28 22:33:59,j1lwt4,"She killed a person while driving fast and received zero punishment. I’m not for her being on the show.

Edit: she was not on her phone"
4399,2020-09-29 01:24:39,j1lwt4,What if she gives us season 1 Camille energy
4400,2020-09-29 00:59:44,j1lwt4,[removed]
4401,2020-09-30 00:17:48,j1lwt4,"I don't like the Kardashians/Jenners, but this comes up a lot and bothers me.  She was in a car accident and someone died.  It is a tragedy.  But sometimes bad things happen, and it's just an accident.  She wasn't drunk or driving recklessly.  Car accidents happen, often cause someone made a mistake.  Sometimes someone dies.  It doesn't mean they did anything worse than the rest of us, when we don't see someone in our blind spot, or think we have time to turn but are wrong."
4402,2020-09-30 05:09:58,j1lwt4,"no from the NY show is married, there’s definitely room for divorcees"
4403,2020-09-28 22:36:30,j1lwt4,also is a Trump supporter but I guess that’s not unheard of in the realm of housewives. she’s just more loud about it
4404,2020-09-28 22:54:35,j1lwt4,"Oh wow, I missed that story! That’s so awful.  How could they even entertain this idea?"
4405,2020-09-29 01:57:20,j1lwt4,I remember when that happened and if I recall correctly she was not on her phone. I think she was driving a little over the speed limit but they definitely said she wasn’t on her phone.
4406,2020-09-29 04:49:51,j1lwt4,Not the appropriate space for this.
4407,2020-09-30 00:22:59,j1lwt4,"Ok, then cancel her for supporting Trump and fighting gay rights while transitioning or for abandoning her kids from her previous marriage. There's a plethora of reasons that she's a scumbag."

4411,2020-09-30 07:08:32,j1lwt4,wow wtf
4412,2020-09-28 22:38:22,j1lwt4,Oh well at least she has that going for her LOL
4413,2020-09-29 01:03:14,j1lwt4,Said to keep the liberals off her ass.  Fact.  Many stars say the same thing.  And they vote Red.
4414,2020-09-28 22:43:39,j1lwt4,But she does have republican old school values.
4415,2020-09-28 23:45:46,j1lwt4,back on my shit list!!!
4416,2020-09-28 23:37:52,j1lwt4,LOL
4417,2020-09-29 01:02:30,j1lwt4,And?  Nothing wrong with that.
4418,2020-09-29 03:44:29,j1lwt4,Republican old school values do not value transgender people. They do not care about the suffering people experience when they don’t transition. So yeah it’s hypocritical to pick and choose. And due to her own privilege fail to see what it is like for people without her wealth and social position to be transgender.
4419,2020-09-28 16:50:34,j1fjrs,How about just no? Why does anybody care about those fake plastic morons?
4420,2020-09-28 15:57:25,j1em4n,Isn’t she 22. That’s way too young IMO. You’re still a child! Idk if BH is the right fit for her!
4421,2020-09-28 15:55:55,j1em4n,"Totally used the title of the article for this post. According to TMZ, Sophia Hutchings sat down with Eileen to talk about the show and is interested in joining as a main cast member and Caitlyn would be a 'friend of'.
Whats everyone's thoughts on this?"
4422,2020-09-28 16:00:48,j1em4n,"So she went out to dinner with a former cast member and they somehow made that into a headline about being ""in talks to join"". No thanks."
4423,2020-09-28 02:27:52,j13v4g,Caitlyn is exactly the right kind of ridiculous RHOBH has been needing lately.
4424,2020-09-28 02:29:02,j13tiv,"No hate, just no thanks"
4425,2020-09-28 02:30:03,j13tiv,Why is BH’s casting so lazy? Are there not any rich everyday entertaining women that they can get to join?
4426,2020-09-28 02:30:40,j13tiv,"No ma’am. All for the representation, but not from Ms. Caitlyn. Nope.

Candis Cayne maybe?"
4427,2020-09-28 02:34:56,j13tiv,Not a fan of Caitlyn. She is an awful person.
4428,2020-09-28 02:28:29,j13tiv,Welp I'm glad I stopped watching this season. This is gonna be a shit show. Even moreso.
4429,2020-09-28 02:30:35,j13tiv,"Someone already posted this. But I have no problem repeating myself

It’s a HARD no from me"
4430,2020-09-28 02:30:10,j13tiv,Please no
4431,2020-09-28 02:36:20,j13tiv,This has been posted a few times already earlier today!
4432,2020-09-28 02:57:08,j13tiv,Ugh please nooo
4433,2020-09-28 02:31:54,j13tiv,"I'm sure there's plenty, but probably none that want any possible secrets to come out. Plus after seeing or hearing how this cast will go after people like LVP and Denise, probably don't want to deal."
4434,2020-09-28 02:55:45,j13tiv,Give me kimora lee!!
4435,2020-09-28 02:40:01,j13tiv,I loved her arc on greys anatomy!! I’d be up for Sophia because she’s hot and likely a gold digger.
4436,2020-09-28 02:38:08,j13tiv,Agreed
4437,2020-09-27 19:01:22,j0whvl,"It's great that you're exploring your own identity and that you are supportive of your diverse group of friends. It's also great that you are trying to explain things to your parents to both educate them and make them more accepting of people who are different from them. I understand you got upset by your dad's comment, but he was really more just bitching about it being complicated than actually being bigoted or intentionally hurtful. Could he be more tolerant and understanding? Yes. But in the grand scheme of things he's not harming anyone, he's just wishing it was simpler. It's not. It's complicated. Maybe one day he'll understand and maybe he won't but it's not worth you getting upset over. Save that level of upset for the many people in the world who hate everyone in the LGBTQIA+ community and spread hatred. This is not your dad.

Also, just for your own knowledge, being pan is a sexuality. That's just who you are. Being poly is a lifestyle choice, it's not an identity. Confusing choices with identities causes problems because it can lead people like your parents or those even less informed than your parents to have the false belief that being gay/bi/ace/trans/etc is also a choice. Be clear about what is an identity (beyond your control) and what is a preference/choice so that people understand the difference.

It sounds like your parents are learning as they go. Be patient with them. This is all new to them and they didn't grow up with these kinds of things talked about the way you have. There weren't even words for a lot of this when they were kids. Be thankful they're trying to be open and trying to learn. Many kids don't have parents who do anything but judge."

Changing her gender did nothing to improve her personality.  RHOBH needs MORE likeable people, not less.  I’m all for diversity and inclusivity, but this ain’t it.  Wrong road, Bravo; wrong road!!"

Bravo housewives, isn't a celebrity show. Yes at one time it was exciting to have celebrities join the cast of regular people for the novelty of it, but this direction that it seems to be going in is completely changing the show. We want no name or barely named people with lots of money who create drama.That is the footprint of the show, please keep it."

4454,2020-09-27 15:15:59,j0s0t9,I’d rather have Teddi than caitlyn
4455,2020-09-27 17:06:36,j0s0t9,I don't want anyone connected to the Kardashians on.
4456,2020-09-27 18:45:39,j0s0t9,"Just NO. 
Bravo and Evolution Media are Desperate to reinvigorate RHOBH because of the recent bad production, bad publicity and loss of fans. 
I think these “RUMORS” and tantalizing tid-bits the gossip rags are leaking (from anonymous sources) including the insane Rinna rants and psychotic Glanville garbage are all a PR stunt to keep the viewers talking and interested."
4457,2020-09-27 19:02:38,j0s0t9,"I’m not interested in watching Caitlyn Jenner on RHOBH. She’s not interesting to watch at all. I’d much rather see Candis Cayne or Laverne Cox  join if they’re going for Trans representation, which I’m totally here for. Candis and Laverne  also have way more personality."

4467,2020-09-27 19:04:58,j0s0t9,I’m fine with Sophia joining to be honest. Also she is friends with Eileen and knows Rinna so it is a somewhat organic entry.

4479,2020-09-27 17:07:38,j0s0t9,OMG did you watch Brad’s IG during early quarantine? What started as a few posts about making Starbucks at home turned into like a daily soap opera of Bradbucks with Brad as the barista and Gary as the regular customer and a romance begins. It’s great.
4480,2020-09-27 16:03:30,j0s0t9,Exactly! The ones who are not afraid to mention it all.

4487,2020-09-27 12:51:53,j0qg25,"I don't really have much of reaction to Caitlyn/Sophia anymore than I did Kris, other than to say BH doesn't need any more hws who are very aware of their public image and who have been in the Hollywood game a long time. Find some unknowns.

Well, it didn't take long for Andy and NeNe's ""parting on good terms"" moment to end lol. I should have known it was too peaceful to be true. 

I'm very nervous for Potomac. The fight, of course, but also this part of the episode description is scaring me: ""*Karen seeks help from a third party to mend her relationship, but Ray’s surprising revelation leaves her in tears.""* If Ray cheated on my beloved Grande Dame I'm going to be furious. Or fucked around more with their money? Ugh g-d stomach in knots.

LISA OLDFIELD! I didn't even know she and David got DIVORCED! I'm a horrible person for saying this because it's a story about an engagement ending but Lisa is horrible so whatever, but OMG this story made me so happy because it's soooo quintessentially Lisa to go scorched Earth and flush the ring down the toilet and FILM IT FOR INSTAGRAM. My fave headline of the week.

It seems like the Jersey wives are out filming literally every night. Don't they get tired??!? I'm tired watching them lol - from the couch in my jammie pants."
4488,2020-09-27 16:20:02,j0qg25,"I heard that Monique beat Candiace up so badly there was blood. If that is true fire her immediately. 

Caitlyn I do not want to join Beverly Hills. Not only because of her awareness of public image, but because I can see such gross divisiveness over her being trans."

4490,2020-09-27 23:10:17,j0qg25,nowhere else to put this but it's come to my attention that kim richards's grandchild is named hucksley wiederhorn.
4491,2020-09-27 21:34:55,j0qg25,"It seems like Kathy joining BH is becoming more and more likely as the days go on. I know one of the issues that BH has is that the cast is guarded about their lives and that she'll probably fit right in with that, but it's obvious from the way that Kyle, Kim, LVP and Rinna have all spoken about her that she is a *terror*. I just wish that they'd bring Kim with her too as a proper cast member so that they can demolish Rinna. She wouldn't stand a chance."
4492,2020-09-27 13:28:47,j0qg25,u/solovelysosoft u/heartdeco I wanna know if the Oldfields splitting up puts a wrench into your plans to mediate their marriage in hell or will they automatically be back together once they cross that fiery threshold?
4493,2020-09-27 16:22:49,j0qg25,No!! That is horrible :( now I’m even more nervous for the fight ugh.
4494,2020-09-27 16:38:16,j0qg25,"Ps re: Monique being fired, I don’t know if I agree. Hws is supposed to be a reflection of real life and sometimes violence is sadly a part of life. I do think there needs to be ownership of her actions though. The reunion is going to be beyond intense."
4495,2020-09-27 16:16:41,j0qg25,"I can’t describe the flutter of excitement I felt when her name popped up in my Google Alerts. I have a sick obsession with her. Watch out “Jimbo,” she’s gonna accuse you of tossing a dead cat next!"
4496,2020-09-27 23:12:04,j0qg25,I knew his name was Hucksley but not that his last name was Wiederhorn. WIIIEEEEDDDEERRRRRHOOORRRRRNNNNNNN. (Yeah I’ve had some wine and some bong hits already).
4497,2020-09-27 23:11:26,j0qg25,i think the show becoming ALL about the richards drama is something to be wary of because :gestures to season five of real housewives of new jersey: but i'm willing to give it a try. at least the kyle and kim shit felt real.
4498,2020-09-27 21:36:45,j0qg25,Terror is good! I’ll take terror lol I just wanna FEEL something when I watch. As much as I think the show isn’t good for Kim I can’t not yearn for the woman who coined the term “slut pig.”
4499,2020-09-27 16:24:45,j0qg25,"Exactly, but the worst part is it seems like Candiace is a bit isolated. The green eyed bandits, Ashley and Wendy are a clique. Ashley is allied with Monique and Karen. And welp Candice seems like on an island by herself. Even Wendy threw her under the bus immediately with Robyn, and most of the cast is stating that they were both wrong in the fight. Andy questioned should she take responsibility for her role in that fight, where she did nothing wrong. Poor thing and I say that’s as someone who doesn’t care for Candiace."
4500,2020-09-27 16:41:43,j0qg25,"My issue isn’t necessarily with the violence but the aftermath. Monique has constantly been deflecting on social media, interviews and in the new song she has made. I don’t really see any accountability for the fact that she initiated, escalated and threw her hands first. This is Porsha all over again and I think it will stagnate the show if Monique simply just can’t say she is wrong without bringing up Candiace’s actions. On top of that the fight got so bad it changed the entire second half of the season, so I just don’t know if it’s salvageable at this point. I love the cast as is but sometimes it just can’t be worked on. 

IDK this entire fight has been so good for discussion though."

4503,2020-09-27 16:30:50,j0qg25,I’m so upset about this for real like more than I have any right to be over a hw show!! I love Candiace. I’m counting on Karen to offer Candiace some support here.
4504,2020-09-27 16:43:39,j0qg25,"I totally agree, whether they can move forward with the current cast intact hinges almost entirely on whether Monique can find it in herself to take ownership for her actions and genuinely apologize. This season has been phenomenal so far on so many levels. I can’t recall ever feeling this emotionally invested in a hw series before. They’ve hooked me on every level."

Hate/offensive language is subjective. For example Cardi B and her Wap. To some it’s sexists and demeaning towards women, but to others she’s got “the numba one song in tha UK”. 

2) censoring guest:
If we follow logical thinking and go through the list of missing episodes we can see quite a few conservative and controversial guest on it. Not to long ago the big tech CEOs sat in front of the senate and couldn’t confirm or deny to censoring conservative material on their platforms. With all the controversy surrounding conservative censorship wouldn’t it be logical to have that assumption especially since Spotify admits to using advocacy groups which could potentially be biased?"

It is pretty easy to see that those ""controversial"" episodes were held back for review and they are being re-added as they get cleared, just like the recent trans related episode.

The simplest explanation is that the missing episodes were held back for review and are being uploaded when they are cleared, because we already know Spotify has a ""woke"" content policy, Daniel Ek has literally directly referenced extensive review for that recent trans related episode so at minimum 1 episode was indeed reviewed before release, and they could have made a different decision if the content was different.

One of his assistants put a finger to his lips, then held it up to his lips. ""Okay, I'll open it.""

""It's pretty much like you trying to tell that to a mirror.""


""Yeah, but I know how you do it. You'll open it. Let me know if it's open."" 


The assistant opened it. His hands were shaking. He stared at the bottom, where the picture was peering out at him. Then he remembered his girlfriend. Who was she? 


""No, there's no way,"" he said. ""We just need to look at a mirror and write it down. Don't give it to anyone. And you know what else? Don't forget me."" 


He looked at the mirror. It was a black and white picture of Caitlyn Jenner. His wife standing there, hair in a bun and glasses on, smiling, dressed as she would in a movie. He was also dressed in a bunny slicker suit. He sighed.


""We're gonna need a new bathroom this year."" He walked over to the blackboard, picked up the black and white and stuck it into whatever computer he would use. The one computer he and his wife were using to watch the news. 


""Maybe you should get laid,"" he suggested.


He glanced around the room. Everything in the room had the same image. Caitlyn? Standing there, looking down at the mirror, as far as he could see her. Her hair was long, so she could've been anywhere she needed it. She was also dressed in a bunny slicker clothes as she went through the motions. 


""Caitlyn's dress is off. Your hair"

That’s a whole other ballgame."
4578,2020-09-27 11:02:04,j0p59l,"This is how I show my face every time I visit. This is my story. 

I had decided that I was going to visit my friends this weekend and I wanted to get to know Caitlyn better. I asked Caitlyn if she had any plans and she said she had. I called and emailed her and set her up an appointment. When I get to her house my heart is beating out of my chest. My friend has a massive crush on her and I wanted to show my guy that she was hot. I text her and tell her to email me the date. She responds that she has and I ask her if she wants me to hang out. She say's she only just got those plans and I ask her if she wants to move in with her, as I am sure that I should have seen it coming. She say's that's fine and I should move on. We get to their house, we start talking and she really seems excited about the plan she had with me. She says:

-I would love to talk to you guys.

Says my friends

Theres a week or so left, and we've agreed that we are going to go out and meet up. I'm about to spend the night in her room. She says she wants to meet it up sometime in April. We agreed to get together and hang out in her room.

Here's where it goes south. Caitlyn wants me to make up some stories about her and her boyfriend. She asks me to use her phone which she can dial from her phone. That's fine, but I didn't want her to see that I was calling her during our hookup. She asks me to send her the pictures of his penis and balls as proof.

This is where it goes south. I told her I had no idea what she was talking about and I told her I never did it. She starts yelling some stuff I don't think she has ever said and it was really awkward. I start panicking and telling her about the pictures and how she might see those and take it as a sign of affection. She yells some more and then has some sort of violent seizure. She says to me:


""Dont tell me you're pregnant!!! I want to be your best Friend. If I knew you were in a relationship and wanted to be with you, I'd have told you.""

At this point I'm"
4579,2020-09-27 12:37:15,j0p59l,"If you have the resources to do so, I think the best thing you could do is to tell him your girlfriend is your mom and that you would have her make a cake (because that's what my GF and I do when her and I are feeling like a bunch of shit) let the people in her life know she's your mom and that you love her more than you think about a man who doesn't love her that much."
4580,2020-09-27 11:53:21,j0p59l,"It wasn't really an interview, it was more Kyle and his dad getting aggressive preaching in South Park."
4581,2020-09-27 11:57:22,j0p59l," Definitely definitely. What I think of is Kyle is the kind of kid that would get bullied in the ghetto.

But I think some of the stuff you mentioned also goes back to how"
4582,2020-09-27 12:54:59,j0p59l,How?
4583,2020-09-27 12:58:02,j0p59l," They were probably joking


The guy is a hero."

4585,2020-09-19 20:45:27,iw0dd5,"The reality is that most people are transphobic to some degree. It sucks. I would say “I wish I was cis” but actually, no, I wish society would just let people be who they are."
4586,2020-09-19 22:35:33,iw0dd5,Honestly all my friends I hang out with are LGBT+ in some way. It's sometimes easy to forget people still aren't as accepting.
4587,2020-09-18 21:35:19,ivf0x3,"Cause theres already like 3 duplicate ones regurgitating the same clickbait piece on the front page, we dont need multiples of the same thing, its called moderating."
4588,2020-09-17 07:11:37,iubgh6,Jenner has done more to hurt trans women than anyone else in recent history CMV
4589,2020-09-17 06:24:13,iubgh6,"> Jenner said she would be willing to appear on Rogan’s podcast, 

Snuck that one in at the end I see. Rogan has been telling this same bit for like 5 years, but _now_ it‘s a problem?"
4590,2020-09-17 03:32:33,iubgh6,"“He’s a homophobic, transphobic a—,” Jenner said of Rogan. “He does this all the time. My daughters have obviously done extremely well. He’s gotten his fame by putting other people down and making jokes about it. My family has done it through hard work.”"
4591,2020-09-17 15:17:37,iubgh6,I had a dream last night that I was on a yacht with the Kardashians in the Mediterranean and Kylie did my makeup and for some reason there was an orca whale there
4592,2020-09-17 13:53:50,iubgh6,"Transphobic has become meaningless. He's right about trans women competing with bio women, even after a year of hormone therapy they still have significant strength, etc over females.

4597,2020-09-16 23:06:28,iu6yhp,Good luck canceling him. He just got 100 million. He now has “fuck you” money. He and Ricky Gervais could do a comedy tour together.

4604,2020-09-16 23:11:20,iu6yhp,Exactly. I cringe every time I hear a celebrity use that as a defense. Such a pompous attitude.
4605,2020-09-17 01:40:47,iu6yhp,Between that and having an opportunistic mother that made the family famous by releasing her daughters sex tape these kids lost the parent lottery big time and I don’t think any amount of money makes up for that.

I almost wonder if he's gaslighting and manipulating her, for her to go from relatively supportive and close, to making such an odd, baseless, and frankly unenforceable threat like that. What's she going to do, sue you for libel/slander? A retelling of facts is neither, and if anything you can argue the greater emotional and psychological distress from the situation."

God, I kid you not, I just stopped playing and pulled my dick out. “fuck, Fuck!” I was yelling in voice chat. I just wanted to hear her voice again. “Please,” I moaned. But she left the lobby. I was crying and covered in my own cum, but I remembered that I could find recent teammates in the ubiplay friends tab. I frantically closed down siege and opened the tab, to find out she had TTV IN HER NAME!!! She was streaming, and only had 100 viewers!!! The competition was low, so I made the first move and donated my months rent to her. I was already about to pre. She read my donation in the chat. God this is the happiest I’ve been in a long time. I did a little research, and found out where she goes to school, but I am a little nervous to talk to her in person, and need support. Any advice before my Uber gets to her middle school?

4633,2020-10-27 16:57:18,jj37s7,"I'm probably a little older than your dad and I came out to my adult sons a couple of years ago.  First it was one of the hardest things to do because I knew I was throwing a big burden on them that they didn't ask for.  I'm sure your dad had those same thoughts when coming out to you.  
First, you have the right to feel the way you feel.  That is something you don't have to beat yourself up over.  This is a big shock. Second, take some time.  You have time to process this and to talk with someone if you wish.  Tell your dad that it is going to take time and you don't want to hurt her.  Be honest if you are going to talk with her about it.  Third, the relationship will change.  It could be for the better or worse.  But it will change and you and your dad will have to accept that.  With my sons our relationship is still awkward somewhat.  They love and support me but it is different.  Talk with you dad and let her know how much you want to know.  Try and only get as much as you think you can process at a time.  

Don't feel bad or think you are wrong for not understanding, hurt, confused.  This is really new.  Especially since it is your dad.  A friend or brother may be easier to accept if they come out.  Being supportive of LGBTQ+ is a great start but again take your time to process it and how you're feeling.

If you haven't seen her as herself ask to see photos or let her know you aren't ready to meet her.

Unfortunately once this comes out the person feels better about not having to hide and the coming out process could pick up steam.  So prepare for that.

Being transgender and hiding it like your dad I was very depressed and didn't know if I wanted to keep living.  Coming out to my family saved my life even though I threw their life into a tizzy.

Love your dad for being your dad and tell her that.  Be honest with your feelings.  

Pronouns mean something so try and use them when you're comfortable.  I told my sons it didn't really matter, but it does.  

Just know your dad loves you."
4634,2020-10-27 16:25:58,jj37s7,"That is a lot for one person to take. I would suggest you find yourself a therapist. Specifically one with experience working with LGBT people and families. 

If you are looking for religious guidance, there are a number of old testament scholars, mostly jews but christians study from them, who have totally debunked the anti gay anti trans readings in the bible. @Theradr on twitter writes a lot about this. 

And remember, your parent will still be the same loving person towards you through all this. You may even get special dispensation to call them dad :)"
4635,2020-10-27 18:01:54,jj37s7,"You're going through stages of grief and you should be allowed to feel however you want; frustrated, hurt, furious for as long as you need. This is loss. Loss is hard because we visualize how our life will be and to suddenly have a brick thrown through that image is understandably shocking. 

On the other side of that shock and loss, when you are ready for it, will be something new. New dimensions to your relationship with the person who was once your father, new chances to understand this person who put off their own happiness for your family's sake. When the dust settles, I think you'll find that your new mother loves you just as much if not more than your old father did and that life will go on and surprise you in a million wonderful ways if you let it. Mourn for now, but don't be too hard on your father. They probably wanted to share this with you a thousand different times but were deathly afraid of losing you."
4636,2020-10-27 18:46:39,jj37s7,"Yes your feelings are valid.
But No, you're not loosing your dad. She is now just expressing her true self. She is not leaving you, and I'm sure you'll receive the same love she always gave you.

I know for fact, she came out to you because she believes in you. That you can accept and love her however or whatever she will be. Have a deep conversations, be honest, it's better to understand it together with her rather than talking to us (yeah but please continue read this 😜). Since we can only make our best guess and best advice, only the related person know the truth.

I'm not a dad and I'm only 21, but I just came out recently to my family. What I can guarantee you, I'm not faking my affection, act of caring, I always be sincere with what I said even before I came out and transition. The only difference after I came out is I'm not covering my feminine side anymore. I am the same person, because this gender dysphoria is about gender identity. Not really directly about personality or behavior.

And of course I'm still progressing here. We all are growing everyday. So please sis, I know 2020 has been a damn rough year, but let's keep fighting and keep growing. Don't be too hard on yourself, you deserve a happy life. Just don't forget to forgive, to love, and to be happy.

Ps: I'm not speaking english as my first language, I born and raised in southeast asia. So sorry If my grammar/words not correct (or somehow offended you). I'm here just tring to cheer you up tho. We have our future in front of our eyes, waiting for us to get there by choosing the right decisions. I hope sharing my experiences helps you understand too even just a little. 😊"
4637,2020-10-27 16:03:15,jj37s7,Wow!!! There is a lot of things going thru your head and heart right now. I’m a 32 mtf transsexual and have been thru the ringer I can’t tell you how many times. You are going thru a huge change in the way you feel and think. This is normal. Your not a bad person for feeling these feelings. My wife went thru the same things you are. If you need or want to talk I’m always here and willing to listen and help as much as I can. I’m more of a talker than a typer person but if you want I’ll give you my phone number and you can text or call me whenever you need to. There is a lot of pain and anger when it comes to “coming out.” You will make it thru this I promise you that.
4638,2020-10-27 17:25:47,jj37s7,"Phew done with lolz it sure took a toll on me reading through all that haha. As you said life isn't wasy and simple and it shouldn't be great things come out of suffering not that i want you to suffer. Just accept the hardships that are occuring in your life focus on your studies does gender really matter? She is still gonna be strong and is still gonna fill the role just the same just cause a person changes their name it doesn't change them you are just being let jn on a secret a different view of a person don't get lost and be side tracked by all the change. She is still the same person with same values. Just different emotions 

And maybe even that might change but so what you can deal with things as they happen just be strong and go about your life as you were. And be the supportive person you were. It's time your an adult now gotta take responsibilities onto yourself. Don't stress yourself over simple irrelevant things. Just be you a more aware, understanding and dependable you. You will be fine and do great 👍"
4639,2020-10-27 18:13:18,jj37s7,"Thank you for your honesty. Im 57 and just starting my journey and although my wife and i have talked about my being TG, we havent decided how to or when to taok to the kids. We are getting divorced unfortunately. I love that you shared your perspective, thank you so much. Youre a thoughful daughter."
4640,2020-10-27 21:56:07,jj37s7,"To add to what others wrote, what she did previously - being hyper-masculine, super religious, even expressing transphobia - is not unusual for people before they accept themselves.  A lot of people try to fit in, try to distance themselves as a coping mechanism, and try to deny/repress by running in the opposite direction.  It doesn't really work, as you're seeing.  But she didn't mean to hurt you and your family in the process.  You did get hurt, though, and I'm sorry for that.  As others said, seeing a therapist could be helpful, because you're going through your own process of grief and change here.

She has had time to work through this, while you're just finding out about it now.  It'll take you time too, and you're allowed to take that time to adjust and figure out to find a new relationship equilibrium with her.  As others mentioned, her transition is likely to accelerate now that she's telling others about it.  It's ok to be unsure and uncomfortable and need some time to reflect on the changes to your relationship with her, because when someone transitions, everyone around them does too.  You'll get through this together.

I'd be forgiving of yourself for feeling different about her transition than you would about a friend's.  It's a closer relationship and affects you more.  Start with name and pronouns, as she feels comfortable with, and go from there.  It's not transphobia to need some time to adjust, and feel afraid of what this might mean for your life and your relationship with her - or for your family in general.  

You don't mention your mom at all through this.  You said that your dad has been on estrogen for over a year, and is talking about GCS (Gender Confirmation Surgery) and other aspects of medical transition.  What discussions have your parents have?  Is their possible divorce something that they have discussed with you, or something you're thinking might/will happen?"
4641,2020-10-27 21:16:51,jj37s7,Your dad has been carrying this around a long time and no doubt struggled with coming out.    Allow yourself as much time as you need to internalize/digest/wrap your head around and ultimately make peace with your dad and yourself.   You’ve already done a lot of the hard part.

4643,2020-10-27 22:56:41,jj37s7,"Wow, quit a story to read. I know it is never the right moment to tell about your true self if you are living in such a conservative environment. He/she has taken a lot of steps and you are having a hard time to keep up with this. Take your time and look at it as a human. Is your father still a loving parent? I think that is the most important thing. Built a new relationship and see how it go. Dont forget yourself, follow your own dreams and goals in this life. You only have one."
4644,2020-10-27 23:06:17,jj37s7,"A therapist can help a lot if it's really traumatic and overwhelming. But overall a lot of comfort will come better from the source. You can get all your questions and frustrations out from the source. All a parent wants is their kids to be happy and love them. Ita a long fight with gender dysphoria and I can speak as many others on the experience. 20 years I held it in before I let go and came out to my family. 

Them being supportive luckily has helped a lot and they asked so many questions some uncomfortable but in the end it helped everyone in the end. As time goes on it's easier and more involved. Everything as far as politics and way of life goes nothing defines what a trans person is or who they are. That's the problem is there is a  misconception that trans people fall under a certain ""category"" of beliefs and lifestyle. I myself am a republican, gun toting, outdoors person. My cousin who is FTM is opposite. We all come from a different shape of life. 

Just know its hurting her more than you on the inside coming up and the worries as well. It's tough not knowing what your lived ones will do over time and the fear of being looked at different from your lived ones is why a lot dont come out. The best advice overall I can give is it's a tough road for all involved. It's a transition for everyone. Just hang in there and have communication. You be surprised on how well it all may turn out when the confusion settles.

 Just remember she is the same ""dad"" as you've always known. Likes and dislikes most of the time stay the same just with a ""twist"". So it's not a new person you are getting to know but the reflection of the person that was inside all along. Just ask questions and get to know the true person inside."
4645,2020-10-27 23:08:50,jj37s7,"You mentioned that your relationship with your ""dad"" was becoming stronger recently. TBH, you were probably only beginning to develop a closer relationship because of the changes he was undergoing (physically but especially emotionally)."
4646,2020-10-28 01:52:27,jj37s7,My step children and a daughter all have struggled with my being diagnosed transgender MTF. I hope he has had gender therapy. Maybe it came as a surprise to your dad also. I came from a family much like yours. Raised kids much like the way you were raised. So I know you really must be struggling as my kids have. Try to be understanding. He needs to know you still love him.
4647,2020-10-29 20:29:39,jj37s7,"Thankyou for your honesty about how you are feeling. I am in a similar situation to your father. Hormones for 3 and a half years but not fully out to extended family and friends. I have come out to my daughter and son who are in their 20s. I understand it has been a shock but you need to try to remember that your father has potentially done this because it gets to the point you can't keep going living the same lie anymore. My suicide ideation continues to rear it's head because I am not 100% out to everyone and the stress of hiding yourself builds up. One of the triggers for me is even though my kids are accepting not once have they asked me are you ok or tried to have a conversation about being trans. I know it's hard but please don't withdraw from them and you might find it helps you to discuss this with them. I can guarantee your father is beating herself up over past attitudes and would love the opportunity to didiscuss their changing ideology with you.
Sorry for the long reply my heart breaks for your suffering but please remember your father still loves you no matter what they look like."

I obviously have a huge investment in LGBT rights.  If I was a lesbian, I would probably know many other lesbians.  But I'm not, and as a result I don't have any more exposure than you get from living in society.

That said, there's some problems with what you've said.  It looks like you've noticed that people don't like transgender people or rather a strawman of transgender people, and you've decided to participate in order to position yourself as more acceptable.  Or perhaps, though years or societal reinforcement, you've lost your ability to see yourself as female.  Please consider your motivations.

You don't reveal that you're transgender, but you also want to always acknowledge that you're male.  There's an inconsistency here.

We are female, and we are women (which are the same statements).  We also have a condition.  Nobody is denying our experiences.  It is difficult for us, and we usually don't want to dwell on it.  We obviously know our history and the nature of our condition.  Stating that we are female is not denial of that; rather it is affirmation of our condition.

What is your definition of fetishist?  Please don't tell me that it has anything to do with passing.

Practically every woman grows breasts and shaves her legs (in the culture that people on this site are predominately a part of anyway).  In any case, this is not seen as fetishism but rather a natural consequence of being a woman.  Perhaps the shaving isn't so necessary, but my point is that it is just seen as something that women do.  So transgender women are fetishists for having the same feelings towards these things that practically every teenage girl does?  That position is incompatible with viewing transgender women as women."

Yes, because they’re both right-wing conservatives. You’re acting like this is some crazy unlikely lion-and-the-lamb feel-goodsy story of how we can all respect each other, when in reality they’re simply from the same political background."

He thinks you are quite literally delusional, he doesn't care if you are one of the ""rAtIoNaL tRaNsMeDs."" He's compared trans people to his schizophrenic grandfather who thought people were talking to him through the radio. He's validated thousands, probably hundreds of thousands of his transphobic fans' transphobic points of view. 

>the non-transmeds only hate him because the facts that he gives them about rapid onset GD

Ridiculous. Trans people hate him because he calls us fucking delusional. I've personally been told by fans of his that I should be put into a mental hospital so they don't have to deal with me. And I'm not even a ""non-transmed."" 

>There's no ""cure"" for us to make us believe that our birth sex is satisfactory,

Probably because it's not a belief, it's a feeling. This whole ""belief"" talk is why he thinks we're delusional. I don't ""believe"" I am a man. I am just uncomfortable with my female sex characteristics and with being perceived as a woman.

Reign definitely fits more with the style of her sisters kids name, so I wonder if that influenced her. I would’ve expected her to choose Rain I stead, it fits more with her laid back style"

4758,2020-12-15 15:52:11,kdnn2k,"Individuals get to determine how they relate to the names they were called in the past. If you haven't been told otherwise by the person, you should assume that the name is dead and not use it. I would say that this even applies if the individual themself uses that name to refer themself in the past sometimes. I still think it's safest not to use it unless they've told you otherwise.

That said, not all of us have that negative relationship to our given name. I don't use mine anymore but I also don't feel negatively about it whatsoever."

I think the reason you were stressing about Elliot being close to his deadname is because you take him more seriously as a famous celeb for us than Caitlyn. 

So I dont deadname myself much anymore, but I do drop the wrong nouns/pronouns in reflexive speech, like ""daddy needs a new colony""! I correct myself most the time or verbalize that i made a mistake. It's the best I can do for that circumstances."
4762,2020-12-15 16:03:14,kdnn2k,"I appreciate your response, but in cases like a major publication covering Caitlyn, I assume the publications have her permission.

4763,2020-12-15 16:19:30,kdnn2k,"I relate to this a lot. When Elliot Page came out, his name being close to the dead name gave me a lot of anxiety. I had to take a few days to sort out the trauma. Caitlyn dropping her dead name in interviews doesn’t provoke  that same anxiety for me, though."
4764,2020-12-15 17:40:05,kdnn2k,"Elliot stressed me out because it resonated with my own thoughts about my own name and how I’d never choose anything close to it. I grew up in a homophobic culture, household, religion, etc. Choosing a name analogous to my own is keeping me close to the danger in a way. It’s not rational on my part, but I feel like I understand it. 

How do you feel about others dead naming themselves, though? And how do you feel about situations where people quote those that deadname themselves?"
4765,2020-12-15 16:19:24,kdnn2k,"I'm not sure if I would be as optimistic about major publications having her permission? Either way, in that case I would use the name Caitlyn and edit out the deadname. If you're talking about a public figure, I think that avoiding the deadname signals to any trans/questioning people who might be near you that understand how harmful deadnaming can be."

4767,2020-12-15 18:30:42,kdnn2k,"I think people get to have their own relationship with their deadname.  But at the same time I get to have my own relationship with how I view mine and them deadnaming themselves.  Personally, seeing someone deadname themselves hurts me because of an empathetic response.  On the flip side, the other person may feel they have reclaimed it and reduced any damage that can be done over it.  But for me that would massively reduce my capacity to be friends with or interact with someone doing it because of that empathetic response.  So if it makes sense, I can respect people who do it but it massively reduces my ability to interact with them.  It's fine though because we don't click with everyone we meet, even those we feel we should and even when they are technically doing nothing wrong."
4768,2020-12-15 18:53:09,kdnn2k,"When quoting individuals with a deadname only use deadname if appropriate, avoid if it's unneeded. Elliot once said in 2018, ""Two coconuts, three coconuts? I'd rather have some kiwis."" This [made-up] sentence said two years ago has nothing to do with gender and so there's no reason to reference that Elliot was going by Ellen in that time. There are only so many instances where you really have to refer to their past. 

For others deadnaming themselves: how often and how deliberately do they do it? I won't join them in deadnaming themselves, and I'll question once why they are doing it. It'd probably just make me sad and try to correctly name them to counteract it."

as for this being ""The Year of Trans Bigotry"", i think that's mostly just. literally anything the UK has done in the last 12 months. For whatever reason, England has decided that their cultural identity is hating trans people, and trans women in particular. Recently, their media has published a load of poorly disguised hate speech that's ended up cutting off a *lot* of trans people from getting their hormones, and they're making it a lot harder for trans kids to get puberty blockers, which by the way, are completely reversible, harmless treatments that gives trans kids the chance to not go through the hell that is wrong puberty.

but there's this idea that transphobes have been pushing, that doesn't actually exist but is a very effective rhetorical tool, that the medical industry is forcibly transing children, who would otherwise be pure wholesome christian cis kids. isn't true, doesn't happen, but the media is pushing it, and in fact, there was an article a day or two ago, that essentially said ""99% of trans people on hormones get happier, and that's a bad thing"". it's just poorly disguised hate speech. and people are falling for it, and being trans, particularly in the UK, has got a whole lot harder and more inaccessible."

4774,2020-12-14 21:30:05,kd5m0g,"In the U.S., at least, this year was a perfect storm for ignorance, fear, and hate.  The pandemic got everyone on edge, and many people had little more to do for broad swathes of time but spend time on the internet, where ignorance is often the currency by which many sites operate.

The US Supreme Court ruling that trans folks could not be legally discriminated against got a lot of people's attention, and it fed that storm. TERFs being a term that got introduced to the world through media and social media spread a different type of ignorance and also contributed to the storm.  Elliot Page's coming out kept trans people in the news and only emboldened the most ignorant.

Against the backdrop of all this was the run-up the the most important election the U.S. has seen.  The fact that one party seeded ignorance and cultivated hate as a means to attract single-issue voters ratcheted up the bigotry to unprecedented levels.  As the internet is all connected, I have no doubt that this hate enflamed the bigotry that already existed in other countries. 

And that is the short answer."

4776,2020-12-13 03:17:50,kc32fr,"I disagree about the Dave one. I think his arc was important to show how people who struggled with their sexuality to the point of considering suicide could eventually get better and live a happy life, like he did in season 6. 

I think his story was a very impactful one, and my only gripe is that they never really showed Dave and Kurt's friendship after 3x14. 

Idea #4 is somewhat similar to The Rise and Fall of Sue Sylvester, isn't it?"

Rachel should've worked a little longer to get on broadway.

Sam should've kept doing modeling

I would keep Kurt at Vogue it really fit him

Maybe have Tina find a new boyfriend in season 4/5 (my baby was lonely)

Give people more love interest (except Rachel and Sam they had way more than others)

I would give Unique a relationship or just anything but the catfish thing"
4778,2020-12-13 03:31:26,kc32fr,"Mine would be:
1. Finn should have been a success whether it was in the army or maybe even getting in to nyada 
2. Mr Schue should not have married Emma and should have found someone else.
3. Rachel should not have left Broadway so quickly. This was her lifelong dream after all and even left Nyada to fulfill her dream playing her dream role.
4. Sam should never have dated Mercedes he could have definitely done a lot better. 
5. Blaine should never have dated karofsky.
6. Kurt should never have dated that old dude
7. Quinn should never have cut her hair. 
8. Season 4 new kids Jake, Marley etc should have been in season 6
9. We should have been given an epic season 6 nationals performance 
10. We should have had more Jesse St. James"

4782,2020-12-13 21:24:36,kc32fr,It sounds like racism to me. If we are being honest Mercedes could have done a lot better than Sam lmao.
4783,2020-12-14 12:17:28,kc32fr,"The user hasn’t responded even though they’ve been active on Reddit so I have to assume that there is a specific reason why they don’t like the idea of Sam and Mercedes together and from their silence I think we can all come to our own conclusions which is very disappointing. Sad to see that people are still so close-minded when it comes to interracial relationships.

Edit: having looked at the users previous comments I’ve also noticed that they just have an innate hatred for Mercedes, weird."
4784,2020-12-12 21:53:06,kbwzk2,"Look, I get the joke you were trying to make, drag people along and make them think you're transphobic then pull a quick switch at the end and you actually hate Republicans, hahaha! But the thing is, we still had to go through the entire first half where you were very strongly hinting at being transphobic. Trans people who read this still have to read your transphobia before you reveal that that's not the point of the post. You're making light of it, and it isn't funny. Find a way to frame your joke that doesn't require people to endure bigotry during your telling of it (I'm sure someone will say that this is the internet, they don't have to read it if they don't want! My point still stands).

Furthermore, your takeaway message here is firstly that you think transphobia is funny and secondly, you actually say that you can't be bisexual because you're not attracted to Republicans. Republican isn't a gender, it has nothing to do with your sexual orientation."
4785,2020-12-12 21:15:17,kbwzk2,"I don't think you had bad intentions and just wanted to joke around, but idk if it really is worth it considerimg how terrible it feels to read this even if you stick to the end."

4787,2020-12-12 13:44:48,kboy5d,"I’d like to touch upon a few points before moving on. I am a trans man and have already transitioned, so I know the ins and outs. Naturally, I don’t know you or your body, but I can give some insight if you’d like.

First, you worried about buying a doll once. Your interests have nothing to do with your gender, those are merely stereotypical expectations forced upon us by society. In reality, they mean nothing! I loved playing with dolls, dressing up as my favorite characters, and I was (and still am) very creative when I was young. That didn’t stop me from developing dysphoria during puberty and eventually becoming more and more masculine until I finally came out as a trans man.

Second, anyone can be on bottom. Masculine men can be on bottom, feminine men can be on bottom. Even trans men can be on bottom and be nothing less of a man than cis men!

That aside, I feel like most trans people will display “signs”, if you will. I had identity problems at a very young age, and I was never comfortable with myself. My mother’s friend used to be a crossdresser for 20 years before coming out as a trans woman herself. My best buddy repressed his feelings and became incredibly defensive because he was afraid to become an outcast, and eventually confronted his feelings. They may not always be obvious, but there are definitely signs, especially during puberty.

I can’t tell you for certain that you aren’t transgender, only you can. But from what I can see, I don’t think you have anything to be concerned about. Most of us, upon learning we have gender dysphoria, are relieved to finally know what’s going on. That doesn’t seem to be the case at all. If anything, your anxiety might be grasping at straws trying to, funnily enough, validate your existance as a gay man by posing the idea of “if you’re a woman, you are allowed to date men”. I won’t tell you what you can and can’t do, but I think it would be worth it to sort out those feelings, because it might lead you somewhere."
4788,2020-12-12 13:53:46,kboy5d,"First of all thank you for reading and replying to my story, there’s a subreddit r/transocd and i found out that there are a lot of people suffering from the same thing and i already posted there but it doesn’t seem to be as active as this subreddit so i decided to post here as well. I would like to add that that i never hated my genitals of anything, i had a very normal adolescence and went through puberty like any normal boy would, i guess that would give you more insight to it."
4789,2020-12-12 14:46:52,kboy5d,"What I meant to say is that your brain might be trying to subconsciously accept itself by playing into gender norms and roles. You say you have conceptions and don't want to be gay, so your brain turns it around and says ""you can date a man if you're a woman"". If you don't feel like you are a trans woman, then it might be worth to look into your conceptions about homosexuality and your aversion towards it."
4790,2020-12-12 14:26:47,kbolrb,"while I do think sexuality can be fluid, I have a feeling that what you're planning to do is some sort of ""conversion"", tryna be with women because a guy broke your heart, and that rarely ends well for anyone involved. Also, it sounds like you could have a massive mountain of internalized homophobia, working on which can also help imporve your mental health. 
If that's not the case and you just hover around on a bisexual spectrum, sure.

Treating TOCD, HOCD etc all work the same way. Acceptance of the thoughts in your head, letting them be, thereby training your brain not to overreact anymore and stop perceiving danger where there's none, and disarming triggers with methods like ERP.

Therapy guided by an experienced licensed OCD therapist is your best option, if it's not possible selftherapy guided by some OCD books is a possibility.

Also i try to view it as a reorientation rather than a ""conversion"". if i might fail to turn completely heterosexual i don’t mind being bisexual as long as i don’t act on my same-sex attractions and I’m way far from being homophobic because i hate homophobia myself.

While I understand that their church does not require them to abstain from all medicine, I also know anecdotally that there is intense pressure within the church to do so, otherwise one's faith in the efficacy of prayer is seen as questionable."

Trump was pro gay marriage before a lot of the country, and during the republican primary, where the bathroom issue was a huge thing, he said that Jenner could use any bathroom she wanted at Trump tower, while his main opposition was heavily religious Ted Cruz.  That being said, Trump was always very clearly a selfish fraud who always contradicts his own beliefs and the only thing we can assume he cares about is himself (maybe his totally hot daughter Ivanka too lol).

4921,2020-12-10 08:04:59,ka1y4f,Yeah Trump basically has no ethics. He says whatever he thinks gets him appeal. Now he's in power he's found screwing over the LGBT community makes him popular.
4922,2020-12-10 03:48:33,ka1y4f,Yeah he was surprisingly vocally supportive but he doesnt care enough or actually believe these things to do anything about.

 I agree with the sentiment here, even right wingers I spoke to at the time generally saw him as “the more pro LGBT one” and argued trans people should be happy to see him get the nomination. I never trusted it but I could forgive someone for taking a “give him a chance” attitude as he started his term. But that should have been out the window the moment he repealed school bathroom protections and applied the military ban, things he wasted little time executing."

4933,2020-12-10 07:48:49,ka1y4f,"I believe you’re getting downvoted because it apparently looks like you’ve expressed doubt at Trump losing the 2020 election. A lot of republicans on Reddit will comment stuff like “he hasn’t lost yet” or post their skepticism that he’s lost at all, and I think a lot of people are downvoting you because your comment looks similar to those on a surface level. 

But I’m gonna go out on a limb and say that the motive behind your comment was confusion, because the article you posted was from 2018, at which point Trump has not lost, and therefore Caitlyn Jenner wouldn’t be trying to save face in his defeat. Saying “Trump lost?” in regards to an article from 2018 has a very different connotation than if you were saying the same thing to an article released today, though I can see why people would get mixed up"

He started his campaign in the summer with that shit and kept hammering on it as the base of his campaign, by the end of the year he was calling to ban all Muslims and openly praising Putin. And even *before* the campaign, he was still the guy who'd spent the last 4 years building his political popularity by talking nonstop about Obama's birth certificate.

There was literally no point in his campaign when it was justifiable to support him."

It was a form of dehumanization that had a particular lack of self awareness. 

Tbh I’m not super stoked about seeing the term on this sub. There’s a fine line between reclamation and normalization, and I personally think it’s better to let the right-wingers keep NPC as their term (makes them easier to identify). But I wouldn’t call someone out directly for it, I think there’s discussion to be had about it, I just think we have better, more fitting insults to use than that one."

The car Jenner hit *didn't* hit the car in front of it at all. Jenner (in Black Escalade that appears to have been towing something, making it slower to stop) was traveling too close to the white car in front of her and hit it at a significant speed, pushing it into oncoming traffic. And then \*Jenner's car\* continued to move forward and hit the car in front of the white car despite having several car lengths to stop because she was driving so fast that she continued to move forward even after hitting one car. The article also says that Jenner may have been driving too fast for the current conditions. When you're driving, you're legally supposed to drive for the conditions, it's not acceptable to simply drive under the speed limit. So in slow traffic where the speed limit is 45 and you're going 40 and everyone else is going 30 and you're pulling a trailer, then that's unsafe and not legal."

Like you, for instance, thinking that Musk founded Tesla. He didn't found Tesla, and wasn't even in charge when the Roadster was released. Perhaps there's a reason that, despite overseeing the design of the roadster, his main accreditation on it is designing the headlamps lmao. 

But yeah, I can believe that he is a mediocre engineer. Take away all of his lucky breaks and he'd probably still be making a decent paycheck. But people evaluate him not on his engineering skills in a vacuum, but what he does and how he acts as a whole."

4974,2020-12-10 15:33:12,ka1y4f,"There isn't really such thing as ""sufficient distance"" in *all* cases.  By law in the US it's meant to basically correct for human reaction time,car breaks, etc, and most collisions.  But the car in front of Jenner came to a sudden stop, so if every car kept that distance (accounting for reaction time variation), it would often be completely unreasonable for traffic, and in no other country I've been to do people drive at that distance.  In the US if you are found to have truly been keeping a bad distance, it is illegal too.  If its automatically illegal in whichever countries you are describing, then that is a stupid law.  Not everything is preventable.  If a person suddenly jumps in front of a car, oftentimes a driver cannot do anything in time."

The car Jenner hit *didn't* hit the car in front of it at all. Jenner (in Black Escalade that appears to have been towing something, making it slower to stop) was traveling too close to the white car in front of her and hit it at a significant speed, pushing it into oncoming traffic. And then \*Jenner's car\* continued to move forward and hit the car in front of the white car despite having several car lengths to stop because she was driving so fast that she continued to move forward even after hitting one car. The article also says that Jenner may have been driving too fast for the current conditions. When you're driving, you're legally supposed to drive for the conditions, it's not acceptable to simply drive under the speed limit. So in slow traffic where the speed limit is 45 and you're going 40 and everyone else is going 30 and you're pulling a trailer, then that's unsafe and not legal."

Or if there's a collision in the lane next to you and a car gets bumped into your lane?  Yeah there's a reasonable distance you need to back away from, which is legally required, and most people do it.  If everyone did some overly-cautious way, nobody would be able to get anywhere.  Less cars being able to pass per second means more gridlock, which lowers speed (and distances between too because speed), and will basically be permanent traffic jams since the effect would compound on itself.  When we drive there is always a certain amount of risk, and if everything was permanently gridlocked it would kind of defeat the purpose of driving in the first place.  I don't know enough about this accident so I can't judge if Jenner was driving OK or not."

When we automatically call someone transphobic because they used a deadname out of pure ignorance and no malice intended, we automatically put them on the defense and shut down what could be a really positive interaction and opportunity for education. 

Many of us are lucky to have exposure to education about the trans community, but we also have to understand that deadname is a relatively new term for a lot of people and education takes time. Ignorance should not be excused when the same mistake is made over and over, but I do think it's unfair to call someone ignorant when the person may not even know about the thing they're supposed to have educated themselves on.

>I watched the lives on Instagram at the time, but haven’t watched back since so I might be misremembering, but If I remember correctly, Monique corrected Chris on the spot for deadnaming and then in Monique’s next live (the following day, I think) Chris interrupted to apologize for the comment in full both the flippant desire to ‘become trans’ and the desire to assault women pieces so it seems like he did think back on his words and/or was encouraged by someone in his world to reflect on what he said and apologize.

Now to housewives: I am not well versed in dead names and the impact that using them has, but I felt that that comment was at minimum distasteful. A, not the chosen name or identity of Caitlyn Jenner and b, implying that he wishes he could HIT the women. BOTH ARE BAD!

Chris seems like a nice person in the broader sense but he definitely has old school values. Between this and his expectation of Monique to just be a dutiful mother and wife whose primary characteristic is that she sucks his D (omg I am still fuming at that game). He has bank rolled her Not For Lazy Moms stuff and it seems like he is tired of that being such a big focus for Monique. I just get the sense from him that he sees Monique’s role in their marriage as to honor and serve HIM but it only goes so far in the other direction. Which makes me sad for her."

This is extreme. Sometimes it's just a mistake. Especially when someone like Caitlyn Jenner was known as Bruce Jenner for forty odd years and was incredibly famous. 

> Perpetuating the extremely harmful stereotype that trans women are a threat to cis women. 

I read it more as 'I will become a woman, so I can hit these women' rather than that. It's still idiotic, but I didn't see it as 'I will be trans because transwomen hit cis women' and I don't the majority would. 

Definitely some valid stuff here, though."

I also will not lie when I first heard the comment I thought he was trying to say he wanted to be an Olympian because I don’t think being a transgender should define you. I had to read and watch it several times to even understand what he was trying to say but once I did I thought oh well he is ignorant and makes sense because of where he grew up. I don’t think we should cancel him because that culture is just dumb, but we all need to keep in mind that Chris is the type of person to be set in his ways and roll his eyes if someone gets offended at something.

I personally think the reason why he is going so hard for Monique now, is he has now seen how has been portrayed and he’s probably overcompensating in his defense of his family and wife."

Candiace had a homophobic tweet from TEN YEARS AGO that was unearthed and ever since then she’s had the “homophobic” tag attached to her despite her immediately apologizing for it online and apologizing for it in her interviews. Chris Samuels went online after his wife assaulted a coworker and said some transphobic sh*t just to get to his final destination of violent misogyny. Yet people are pushing back so hard on the transphobic label? Which is cool, I don’t like people being immediately labeled for every mistake they’ve made especially after they’ve apologized for it.

She said no other pharmacy would use her preferred name until her license matched. All it took was a simple notation on the patient’s profile that [preferred] is trans pt, legal name [dead]... and that was only because her prescriptions had her dead name on them. Once her prescriptions read [preferred name] we removed the note 🤷🏻‍♀️

It really broke my heart that her name was that important that she’d forgo convenience to simply be seen... and no one else would accommodate her. Which quite frankly was bullshit. The amount of patients that I have that go by a nickname or middle name instead of their legal name is astounding. And I’ve never seen anyone refuse to call them by that name or question it.

Then... most importantly she actually says “I’m deeply sorry for the hurt and damage that I caused in making these stupid, harmful, negligent choices”.

It’s a really long apology, but she goes into why it harmful and the effect her actions have on people in the trans community."

We gotta understand that MOST are not as educated in these matters as we think and sometimes people truly don’t mean any harm. For example, I was one of those assholes that used “gay” in a problematic way, like telling my friends they were being “gay” when they were really just being dumb. I had zero intent to do harm with that statement. I just didn’t understand. Once I realized the harm it could have I reached out to a friend of mine who came out after high school to apologize for my words, because I finally understood the impact they possibly had on him."

It's okay to ask him to not perpetuate anti-trans stereotypes because it contributes to the culture of hate and violence against trans women. 

While I agree that Chris likely didn't grow up knowing about dead names, and understanding the specifc stigma transwomen face- why is it so bad to ask him to do better?"
5049,2020-12-09 08:23:14,k9n0w8,"I can agree I don’t think his intent was to be transphobic. A lot of people don’t intend to harm minorities but sadly, sometimes unintentionally do. Which is part of why it’s so important to call it out so they have the chance to grow and learn and be better allies. I wish it was as easy as only intent mattering. Part of why I am so concerned is because Monique’s best friend of many years is a trans woman who even auditioned for a role, but Candiace got it, so he has had at least some exposure to trans people.

5055,2020-12-09 21:23:24,k9n0w8,"No, it isn't a reach. Dead naming is something trans people are telling you NOT TO DO. Why are you always excusing racism/transphobia/homophobia. It's disgusting."
5056,2020-12-09 11:56:48,k9n0w8,Words =/= violence.

5059,2020-12-09 11:35:56,k9n0w8,"I gave the OP an award as soon as I read this post, because it said a lot of what I'd been thinking but couldn't properly or respectfully express, when a post about Chris' comment went up the other day.

I also just think it's cool when people tackle a tough topic in this sub, because it's much easier to score likes and awards here with a meme of a catchphrase we've all heard a million times. 

Edit: Getting an immediate downvote for explaining why I liked this post confirms why this post doesn't have as many upvotes as it should."
5060,2020-12-09 10:04:33,k9n0w8,How? are awards sus? Like... what are you accusing me of LMAO
5061,2020-12-09 13:14:25,k9n0w8,"This is a controversial topic to a lot of people, so the reactions should not be surprising. The people who care deeply about these issues will award the post, while Transphobic people will downvote it."

5063,2020-12-09 18:55:14,k9n0w8,"It's not harm to just Caitlyn. It's harm to all trans women and people. Transphobia, homophobia, and racism are not mental illness. Comparing that to body weight is... absolutely wild to me if I'm honest and kind of tone deaf? No malice from Chris, yet he's talking about smacking women with a transphobic delivery vehicle. Anybody who deadnames a known trans woman is being transphobic. Of course, with the exception of accidental cases. People can be transphobic without realizing it at all, and in the same vein, they can realize they have said and done transphobic things in the past (which we all have, including me) and decide to learn and grow. To make an effort to be a better ally and look the transphobic parts of themselves in the eyes and work on changing. It doesn't mean he's irredeemable or you have to unstan, but it does mean he should be held accountable for any damage he has done."
5064,2020-12-09 15:33:27,k9n0w8,Not in the “smack you around with my hands” sense but verbal violence is a thing.
5065,2020-12-09 16:25:14,k9n0w8,"So says you. 100 years ago, smacking your wife upside the head wasn’t an act of violence because, well, your wife was your property. If you can accept the fact that the very definition of what is meant by violence has changed in the last few decades, then it will become clearer why you don’t necessarily need physical blows to the head to have a violent act."
5066,2020-12-09 17:23:14,k9n0w8,"Yep, you can hold the person accountable for their *behavior* and allow them to redeem themselves through changed action and words.  People think because you’re pointing out a problematic notion that it must mean you want the person cancelled.  I think we can all recognize how behind on social issues those who come from uber-religious backgrounds can be while also letting them know it was unacceptable.  

Now if the behavior continues and the person stays steadfast in their comments we have a problem that cannot be separated from the person as a simple lack of understanding or knowledge."
5067,2020-12-09 19:04:57,k9n0w8,I'm surprised that the focus isn't more on that he wanted to beat women.
5068,2020-12-09 19:15:14,k9n0w8,Who said that??
5069,2020-12-09 21:20:51,k9n0w8,"and they're in charge of your mind? 

And maybe you should think twice about liking someone who says something so horrible, but I guess since it isn't attack against you and just against trans people it's okay."
5070,2020-12-09 16:57:05,k9n0w8,"Yes! After explaining how Chris' comment was transphobic to a Monique stan yesterday they said, ""I hope you keep that same energy for your faves."" Like, of course I keep the same energy for anyone who is being transphobic?? It's not about coming for the Samuels."

5072,2020-12-09 13:35:34,k9n0w8,"I was referring that people minimize what he has said because they love her. Not that they minimize how he behaves toward her, that was in reference to his general behavior and attitude toward women."
5073,2020-12-09 13:25:28,k9n0w8,Yep. I said a couple times that my comment had nothing to do with Chris or Op’s explanation. I was speaking about the topic in general since this incident opened the conversation.
5074,2020-12-09 16:26:49,k9n0w8,"If you look at this from a complete birds-eye view, it's kind of fascinating how he's basically getting a pass on what you're correct in calling violent misogyny because everyone is taking a detour to focus on the transphobic part and not getting to the final destination of his overall comment. 

I'm not saying all the parts shouldn't be examined, but it's interesting how so much attention has been diverted away from what is a ridiculously fucked up thing to say overall.  

He really needs to take a hard look at himself and make some heartfelt apologies about so many pieces of this rant."
5075,2020-12-09 11:32:19,k9n0w8,"Intent doesn’t matter at all regarding how hurtful/harmful the statement is.  

Intent does matter big picture, if the person realizes their mistake and makes genuine, consistent effort to educate themselves and others."
5076,2020-12-09 14:21:31,k9n0w8,"I think intent is relevant when making a judgment about a person's character, BUT ultimately, intent is irrelevant when discussing the damage that comments like this make to the trans community.

An analogy is littering. 

Someone may be accidentally literring by failing to recycle correctly, which means more plastics end up in landfill. So their intent is good, but ultimately, the same amount of plastic ends up in landfill as someone who throws it onto the sidewalk. So the damage ultimately is the same, regardless of intent."
5077,2020-12-09 12:06:09,k9n0w8,"I commented above as well, but wanted to point out that he did reflect on his words and apologized the next day during Monique’s other live"
5078,2020-12-09 14:18:07,k9n0w8,"In his mind a man hitting a woman is wrong, but a woman hitting another woman is socially acceptable. 

Which is why he wants to be like Caitlyn and change gender to commit assault. 

It doesn't surprise me that this is his position, since he seemed to mostly be ok with his wife getting physical.

The only negativity he seemed to give Monique for her actions, was more about how it could make them look, rather than the issue that his wife physically hurt another human, not in self defence."
5079,2020-12-09 10:57:24,k9n0w8,But simply not understanding this nuance is an act of violence according to you?
5080,2020-12-09 12:50:07,k9n0w8,"There’s a difference between a first and a surname, and you know it."
5081,2020-12-09 14:27:07,k9n0w8,"Clearly, you’re not a teacher."
5082,2020-12-09 12:43:01,k9n0w8,"This is a great, relatable way to explain deadnaming!"
5083,2020-12-09 11:55:17,k9n0w8,"hard agree on everything OP posted and appreciate the thorough explanations.

I watched the lives on Instagram at the time, but haven’t watched back since so I might be misremembering, but If I remember correctly, Monique corrected Chris on the spot for deadnaming and then in Monique’s next live (the following day, I think) Chris interrupted to apologize for the comment in full both the flippant desire to ‘become trans’ and the desire to assault women pieces so it seems like he did think back on his words and/or was encouraged by someone in his world to reflect on what he said and apologize."
5084,2020-12-09 08:30:54,k9n0w8,Yes absolutely it will be a shame If people try to cancel him and call him transphobic whenever there’s a post about him for now on though.  hopefully someone calls him out but with genuine concern and support for trans not for the cameras or storyline ect
5085,2020-12-09 16:23:22,k9n0w8,I am arguing speech can never be violent
5086,2020-12-09 14:57:52,k9n0w8,I hear verbal violence and I instantly think of people that type in all caps with a bunch of exclamation points.
5087,2020-12-09 22:33:55,k9n0w8,"They aren't saying deadnaming isn't bad. I think we can all agree it is. I think they are saying that calling it ""violence"" is extreme."
5088,2020-12-10 07:56:36,k9n0w8,Keep missing the point and being a reactionary. I didn't excuse jack shit.
5089,2020-12-09 14:40:48,k9n0w8,"Wish I could frame this comment and hang it in every thread that says Candiace deserved to get assaulted because of her words.

edit: actually, feel like clarifying in case people think i agree with the comment im replying to. I find it RICH that Monique fans were trying to claim Candiace arguing with her was the same as violence and that the fight was ""mutually consented"" in Monique's words (it wasn't). But now that Chris is actually making a violent statement that is rooted in transphobia, suddenly words no longer equal violence."

I’m confident in who I am, and I don’t think everyone is out to fuck over the trans community. The point about weight is that you can be phobic about anything if I take your reasoning and apply it. We are all different people in life, and people can exist without threatening others. People take up a SJW fight when there are people like me who don’t need you to speak for a whole community.

5096,2020-12-09 18:56:10,k9n0w8,"I’m trans, and I wasn’t offended."
5097,2020-12-09 16:58:01,k9n0w8,"Yeah. Smacking a woman upside the head and calling someone by the name they were known as for 60 plus years seem like two very different things.

But go off.

I never hear anyone say that using racial slurs are literal acts of violence. But something like the above is? Ok."

5102,2020-12-09 13:40:10,k9n0w8,Oh I see. Folks dismissing the slapping threat.  That’s a good point.  Gotcha.
5103,2020-12-09 13:27:56,k9n0w8,"Maybe I'm just sleep deprived, but I don't see where you've said any of that.

Edit: just saw your last sentence. And I see what you're referring to, but it's honestly not very clear that you aren't referring to the OP' post."
5104,2020-12-09 16:37:24,k9n0w8,"I’m not trying to clutch my pearls here, but some part of me wonders if it’s being ignored because society is used to ignoring threats to women until something bad happens. Because let’s be real, “I want to slap the sh*t out of you” and “y’all are lucky I’m a man because I would’ve stomped you” is a threat. It’s cool he apologized, but this man went in front of cameras and threatened to assault women and I’m not okay with that."
5105,2020-12-09 21:04:13,k9n0w8,Women will always stay losing. He wanted to beat up women but let's ignore that.
5106,2020-12-09 15:46:42,k9n0w8,"This person was asking to clarify if they should use a trans person’s chosen name when referring to something they did before their transition. Chris Samuels used Caitlyn’s deadname when referencing her as a trans woman.

In my opinion the former is somebody trying to educate themselves. The later is an act of violence."
5107,2020-12-09 11:01:58,k9n0w8,"Not understanding is different to what has happened here though in my opinion. Caitlyn coming out was incredibly high profile news, and a lot of celebs got shit for using her deadname. I live in a very different world than most, having a lot of trans friends and family, so maybe it is harder to understand to most people than I think. Chris said her deadname while also referring to who she is now, a woman, kind of implying he knows the right name. I have accidentally deadnamed people before, but intentional deadnaming is what is extremely wrong, which is what I feel this was. If he didn't know and didn't understand the nuance, then he should acknowledge that he still messed up and apologize. I hope that is the case, but it just doesn't read that way to me unfortunately."
5108,2020-12-09 16:32:48,k9n0w8,"I know people who have legally changed their first name who are not trans. People who knew them before and after the name change still refer to events that happened pre-name-change by their new name. If they mess up and call them by their old name, its an automatic ""oh, sorry, ______"". Yes, this is anecdotal, but there really isn't that much difference between first and last name changes."
5109,2020-12-09 16:54:44,k9n0w8,"Sure, but nobody says Scheesey Maidename was called to the bar in 2012, even though that’s who I was then. It would be Scheesey LastName. I’m not sure how that differs from using an “expired”, out of date, no longer in use first name. Particularly since my identity as a member of my childhood family isn’t traumatic to me, but it’s still easy for people to use my new family name."
5110,2020-12-09 17:01:35,k9n0w8,"No, I’m a lawyer who goes by Attorney LastName. I guess we can give a pass to literal children, but adults seem totally fine accepting and using changed names in every circumstance I’ve seen."
5111,2020-12-09 11:58:32,k9n0w8,Really glad to hear he did apologize immediately once corrected. Thanks for the intel.
5112,2020-12-09 08:34:18,k9n0w8,"Yes! And I added an edit to clarify that because I realize it may come off that way. If he continues down this path, then I’ll be done, but I do want us as fans to hold him accountable and tell him where he has gone wrong so he can correct it. I definitely don’t have any pitchforks... YET. Also I hope they don’t make this into a storyline, but also... I have little faith they won’t."
5113,2020-12-09 21:22:29,k9n0w8,There is a thing called hate speech for a reason.
5114,2020-12-10 02:59:05,k9n0w8,"But where is your argument? You’re just making statements. Here is an example of someone who has written about the topic of words being violent:

https://daily.jstor.org/wittgenstein-whether-speech-violence/"
5115,2020-12-09 18:50:46,k9n0w8,Im pretty sure Karen makes the exact opposite argument in the upcoming reunion episodes
5116,2020-12-09 16:46:28,k9n0w8,"welp, there’s the fallacy in your argument"
5117,2020-12-11 06:11:37,k9n0w8,It seems everyone who is hung up on the “violence” here keep omitting “act of”... your speech can be AN ACT OF violence.  I’m not understanding how that correlation can be missed...
5118,2020-12-09 18:34:26,k9n0w8,"Based on this article, “verbal violence” is more well known as “verbal abuse”. I think that’s the main thing that is confusing ppl. Generally, “Violence” to most of us must contain a physical act, but we have come to accept that “abuse” can occur without a physical element (verbal). 

Also interesting to note that according to the definition in the article, there is an enormous amount of “Verbal Violence” on Real Housewives. Oh and Candaice has been very violent verbally to many people including Monique (not defending just thought it was interesting)."
5119,2020-12-09 10:11:04,k9n0w8,Okay but like... again what are you accusing me of? The people said trans rights what can I say
5120,2020-12-09 15:47:03,k9n0w8,"74% is barely upvoted? In what world is almost 3/4 ""barely?"" OP isn't being defensive, you're being ridiculous and derailing the conversation by mentioning something so inconsequential to the message of the post"

Also, this is more of an intercommunity topic/issue at this point so i really have no right to comment more than I already have. Have a good day"
5123,2020-12-09 18:58:03,k9n0w8,"But you can't speak for an entire community, or the other trans people in the comments who were upset. Or the trans woman who read over this post for me voluntarily to make sure it was all good and everything was explained well. You can speak for yourself, and I'm glad it didn't hurt/impact you, but you are not alone on an island."
5124,2020-12-10 00:58:53,k9n0w8,"No. I don’t even necessarily agree that words can be violent. What I’m trying to say is that to progress, sometimes we need to redefine what we mean by certain words.

And absolutely agree with you...if we are going to say that deadnaming is an act of violence than 100%, any slur is violent. A racial slur is definitely violent (if we assume that words are violent)."
5125,2020-12-09 20:05:27,k9n0w8,"I'm thinking it's similar to when people say ""those are fighting words""?"

5128,2020-12-09 13:49:54,k9n0w8,"> Again, this has ZERO to do with Chris' actual comment - he needs to apologize like yesterday. I'm just speaking in general on this topic.

I assumed that by saying my comment had nothing to do with the Chris incident that it would also imply by extension that it had nothing to do with OP's explanation of the incident, but apologies if it didn't come across that way. I think OP did a fantastic job of detailing what was wrong with his comment. 

What I was trying to say is I wish *in general* that we could all feel safer having constructive conversations about this and other difficult topics. I'll admit that as a straight white woman I'm often terrified to engage in these types of conversations for fear of saying the wrong thing without knowing it, which imo is kind of sad. How can any of us expect to learn and grow if we shy away because we're afraid to make a mistake and learn from it? 

I never *ever* want to hurt anyone and I know a lot of people feel the same, but are worried about unintentionally putting a foot in their mouth.

Edit: I just saw your edit after making this comment. Again, apologies. I think we're on the same page though."

I work with seniors and have had some ask me not to think less of them for being part of the LGBTQIA+ community. That broke my heart. My Conversely, my stepchild recently told me that she identifies as bisexual. She said it in an offhand way, and we discussed it a bit (I have a longer comment about it in my history if you really care to see the details), but I was incredibly proud that she felt comfortable to make it such a casual conversation. Looking at the difference between those generations already gives me hope. Thank you for the work you do with our youth!!!"

5142,2020-12-09 16:52:36,k9n0w8,Some people in the comments here claimed he apologized. I didn’t see an apology in the video so maybe it was done at a later date.
5143,2020-12-09 22:30:36,k9n0w8,"Right. Speech is sounds you make with your mouth. Yes, it can hurt, but ""violence"" is hyperbolic. Aaand I have never once heard ""violence"" used to describe hateful speech towards women or other marginalized groups."

Calling the post suspect, not providing any explanation for why you’re saying that and then trying to turn it around like someone who is defending themselves from a baseless accusation is evidence of the original claim. Stop!"

5192,2020-12-09 02:03:13,k9idja,She learned a new sex technique and she wants to brag about it
5193,2020-12-09 02:14:55,k9idja,She’s trying to compensate for the fact she’s never done anal
5194,2020-12-09 07:14:03,k9idja,I’m so tired of Alex joking about her asshole
5195,2020-12-09 03:42:19,k9idja,Also why focus so much on how to please dudes? She could be focusing on how to empower girls to make their orgasms a priority.
5196,2020-12-09 02:15:00,k9idja,That Emily girl from sex with Emily. She was on an earlier ep in the single father era and that one was eh so I’m wondering how much better this one is gonna be
5197,2020-12-09 02:11:22,k9idja,Your guess is as good as mine.
5198,2020-12-09 05:41:00,k9idja,"She's a ""sex expert"" and has  been a guest on a bunch of other podcasts/interviews in the past. She usually just gives tips and advice. I don't think she claims to be an actual physician."
5199,2020-12-09 13:51:18,k9idja,"Oh I might have to listen to that! Thanks for the recommendation. 
Also Whoreible Decisions talks about anal pretty frequently. One of the co-hosts had never done it at the start of the podcast, and over time she tells her stories of training and how she personally prepared to have anal sex for her first time. It’s a fantastic podcast!"
5200,2020-12-09 23:54:54,k9idja,YES! Literally ran to the episode I was like gotta listen to this and then was so disappointed

5202,2020-12-09 11:00:13,k9idja,Not intended an insult. Just a human that looks like another human.
5203,2020-12-09 15:03:05,k9idja,If you think it’s an insult I think you need to evaluate any internal prejudice you might have to trans people

The Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality (IASHS) was an unaccredited, for-profit, degree-granting institution and resource center in the field of sexology in San Francisco, California. It was established in 1976 and closed in 2018. Degree and certificate programs focused on public health, sex therapy, and sexological research. The institute grew out of research in the 1960s highlighting the general lack of understanding of and formal training in human sexuality.

5223,2020-12-09 17:18:18,k9idja,As a medical doctor who has gone through what you are going the through I completely agree!
5224,2020-12-09 12:35:01,k9idja,No! She is not a doctor. I think you are confusing this with someone who received an actual PhD in psychology- you could absolutely call this person a doctor. Emily is not a doctor.

5226,2020-12-09 16:54:06,k9idja,I’m not exactly sure what you are responding to here. I was informing the incorrect comment above that stated only a medical doctor can be called a “doctor”. I’m not talking about Emily.

5238,2020-12-07 23:58:53,k87wj0,"> Tell me again what’s wrong with being a transgender Republican?

Well, let's see. The official 2020 Republican National Committee platform includes support for ending same-sex marriage, blocking trans people using bathroom designated for the gender they identify as, and encouraging ""conversion therapy"" for LGBTQ kids. And Donald Trump, the de facto leader of the party, banned trans people from military service for no good reason, and rescinded protections for trans students and trans healthcare patients. And that's just the official GOP-as-a-whole stuff - individual Republicans say and do all sorts of worse transphobic stuff."

My grandma always voted republican (when she was alive) but she was still really kind and supportive toward me all through out my transition and many times coming out.
5243,2020-12-07 03:01:39,k87w14,"It doesn't make me dislike her, it just keeps me from relating to her in any way because she isn't trying to be educated about her own community and our struggles. She is ignorant, and while that harms us, I don't fault her for it. She should do better"

5263,2020-12-05 18:28:56,k7baqz,"Gender and sex were synonymous until the 1950s when a peddler in psychobabble by the name of John Money decided they weren't. He pushed sex reassignment surgery on a little boy who had a botched circumcision and thought that raising the kid as a girl would support his insane ideas. Sadly, the little boy grew up unhappy and confused and ultimately committed suicide. Oh, and John Money was also a pedophile-apologist. His crazy ideas were picked up by a woke lesbian 'philosopher' called Judith Butler who pushed the idea that gender is a costume that anyone can slip into and out of. That's it, the whole gender craze is built on the back of these two nutjobs. Now the rabid wokerati believe that a woman who enjoys using power tools is really a man, and a man who likes knitting is actually a woman.

Ellen Page can call herself what she likes, she was born female and will always be female. Snowflakes, feel free to cry and retreat to your safe spaces."
5264,2020-12-05 17:27:51,k7baqz,"Let's not start with deadnames again. It is a really syupid argument, especially in this case. This isn't about some random unkown person being trans, it is about a famous person, who has quite a lot of history with the name Ellen. Sure, he goes by Elliot, fine, but the first time I read about Elliot, I was pretty confused, as I didn't have the slightest clue who Elliot was, until I saw that it actually used to be Ellen Page. In this case, using Elliot's ""deadname"" is simply a way to inform people who we are talking about, as most are familiar to the previous name."

Do you also know what other things were seen as facts in the 1940s? You can't quote things that old. Gender dysphoria is a literal condition that has existed for centuries. Transgender figures can be seen as far back as Ancient Greece, so don't try and say they are just a new thing. Gender and sex are separate, and that is a fact. And how dare you misgender and deadname Elliot. It's clear that you are transphobic."

There are plenty other ways to talk about a person's pre-transition phrase without using their deadname. By deadnaming you are refusing to respect someone's identity, making using them normalized, and being transphobic if you refuse to correct yourself (even if this was not your intention). Don't go defending people who use deadnames. Sincerely, a transgender man whose deadname was used against them in a transphobic way too much as a child."

5285,2020-12-05 18:36:44,k7baqz,Intersex people have existed for millennia and have a real biological condition. Unfortunately there are a lot of people jumping on the trans bandwagon and Ellen Page is one of them.
5286,2020-12-05 18:04:41,k7baqz,"Oh yeah, because everyone has seen the Umbrella Academy and/or Juno. I have seen the Umbrella Academy, and even I was confused as to who Elliot Page was. Also, calling everything transphobic is a sure-fire way to reduce the value of your argument. Not everyone or everything is transphobic. Elliot Page has an entire history behind him as Ellen Page, and that's how people know him. This is just a way to clarify who we are talking about, while acknowledging it is a deadname, and don't expect everyone to get used to it within a moment's notice. Take Kaitlyn Jenner, for instance. When she transitioned, she would on occasion be referred to as ""formerly known as Bruce"" so people had a clue who they were talking about. But as time has passed, most are used to calling her Kaitlyn. Those who do not wish to do so make it perfectly clear. 
Also, while your experiences as a child are valid, they aren't the experience of every transgender person out there, and your take on it certainly isn't universal."

5297,2020-12-05 18:10:46,k7baqz,"No, but that's not a valid argument. If a white person and a black person were having an argument about if something was racist or not, who would you listen to?"

5300,2020-12-05 18:12:42,k7baqz,"Depends, who is the racism directed at?"
5301,2020-12-05 18:13:31,k7baqz,"A black person, just as deadnaming is aimed at trans people."
5302,2020-12-05 18:23:09,k7baqz,"A black person might have more experience with racial discrimination than a white person, just as a trans person usually has more experience with discrimination towards their gender identity than a cis person. That being said, neother black people, nor trans people are a hivemind. While there are many practices that are considered discriminatory and/or offensive by the majority, there are also cases when it can vary depending on the person's perception of it. What one considers offensive, isn't offensive to another person belonging to the same group, especially in given contexts. As a gay person, I might perceive a confrontation as homophobic based, though it does not necessarily make it so. Being black doesn't necessarily make one an expert in racism, just like being trans doesn't make you an expert in transphobia, and being gay doesn't make me an expert in homophobia."
5303,2020-12-05 18:25:41,k7baqz,"But it certainly means that I am better at identifying and pointing out transphobia than you, especially if I have experienced it myself. Deadnaming is transphobic. I can link more sources explaining why if you'd like."
5304,2020-12-05 18:34:49,k7baqz,"Or it means that you might have more bias in identifying something as transphobic, just as I have more bias in identifying something as homophobic. I read the two articles that you linked and aside from a very innacuratte paralell, they didn't really put much effort into analysing this as a complex situation, rather they just pasted a rather black and white rhetoric. Coming from a country where ""LGBT"" is still a rather hush-hush kinda topic, I see these kinds of arguments as people having nothing better to do than sensationalize a topic. Instead of normalizing trans people these rather trivial issues make people less sympathetic towards LGBT individuals. Everyone has problems, everyone's problems are valid, but not everyones problems are solved at the snap of fingers. Trans people have only recently become a non-taboo topic in the west, you cannot expect people to bend over backwards for everything everyone says."
5305,2020-12-05 18:38:03,k7baqz,"Jeez, just accept that deadnaming is transphobic. Again, it's a fact. Stop trying to defend yourself with your words. You're just defending your blatant transphobia."
5306,2020-12-05 18:41:14,k7baqz,"Sure call me transphobic for not agreeing to everything you say. That is a great way to make people more sympathetic to trans people's cause. When you finally defeat actual transphobia by having called everyone a transphobe, let me know."
5307,2020-12-05 18:42:48,k7baqz,You ARE an actual transphobe. And you've made yourself look worse for defending your transphobia. Just apologise for deadnaming and you won't be labelled as a transphobe anymore! Simple as that!

Literally no reasonable person, trans or cis, has ever said you need to instantly offer yourself to any trans person you meet or you are transphobic. But if you also literally refuse to ever even date a trans person, no matter any other circumstances, that is discriminatory. 

For race... can I ask why it is you would always choose the white woman over a perfectly identical black woman? Because... if the only difference between them is race, and you are so convinced race is THAT big of a factor for you, thats eyebrow raising at the very least. It comes dangerously close to saying that you think race is itself an attractive or unattractive characteristic.

Fatness I dont really have much new to add. Much like the trans example, there is a big difference between 'not immediately' and 'immediately not'. You dont need to date every fat person, but if you are deadset that no fat person *ever* could be attractive for you, that is rather rude"

If someone is more likely to be attracted to white/black/asian/etc. people, it's not."

For instance, some guys are into chicks with big boobs, others with small. It’s a preference. On the trans I’m also gonna agree because it’s something that has the potential to impact your sex life, wether the person is pre or post op. And I don’t personally believe people’s sex lives should be political, it’s literally about preference. However, if you treat fat/trans or people from other races badly, just on the base of what they are, that’s prejudiced"

5329,2020-12-03 00:30:47,k5lrl7,"1. It's my preference if I want to date a trans person or not. I don't want to date someone with a dick. I don't want to date a girl who looks like a guy. So, if those two criteria are satisfied by a trans person, regardless of how well we click personality-wise, it's a deal breaker.
2. I find white more attractive. It's not racist, it's just my preference. In that hypothetical, I could only choose one-- and they were identical in every other aspect. So naturally, I'll choose what I've preferred. 
3. I don't find fat people immediately attractive. that's my choice. Not attracted to  rolls of fat or a person who can't hike a simple trail. I suppose if my current girlfriend of 3 years got a bit bigger one day, I'd still be in love with her; however, that's the one special scenario."
5330,2020-12-04 06:22:36,k5lrl7,You can’t seriously say is discriminatory to say you would never date a trans person. That’s complete insanity it is never discrimination to not want to date someone. It’s a preference. Are gay men discriminating against women? No. Pe people like you are why more and more non religious people are not supporting lgbt. That’s insanity
5331,2020-12-03 06:20:41,k5lrl7,"I prefer women with dark hair over light hair.  I am not at all attracted to red heads.  I also have a romantic preference for lighter skin.  I don’t think that would ever prevent me from dating someone with darker skin, but my preference still exists just as it does for hair color, height, etc.  I don’t think people who don’t meet my preferences are worth any less, but if I’m not sexually attractive to someone, that should not be offensive.  In the same way that I don’t take offense to people who are not attracted to me.  

As for the trans issue, I’d extend that logic to it.  Some people pursue relationships with the desire to have biological children, or simply are not attracted to someone who has transitioned.  If they spit hate or attack the legal rights, they are being discriminate, but a person has the right to say that they personally do not want to date a person who has transitioned.  Applying this individualized logic guarantees the most good, as imposing views on who people have to date would reopen a dangerous door that was only relatively recently closed in the west.  The natural next step is who imposing who you can’t date, or can’t marry, and that will just do more harm."

The best strategy is to keep your preferences private.  That way you won't feel the need to justify and rationalize them.  Of all of the natural rights out there, the right to like what you like, and associate with whom your want to associate cannot be taken away from you.  Exercise it freely.  And my advice: stop trying to explain it."

There are white women that look better than black women


There are black women that look better than white women

Same goes for every race


If you are faced with a choice of a decent looking black vs a average looking white, you may be choosing the black.


It's just a bit silly to say one objectively always looks better than the other. Humans are humans and more importantly men are going to behave like men. We as men will turn on many of our own preferences and values in the name of sex if the conditions are right.



Just look at history. almost every coloniser/ invader/ slaveowner had stark and even highly illegal laws against screwing black and browns. 

But in almost every case(maybe actually every case) a number of those people said f it and low and behold you have a massive amount of mixed people in the world despite it supposedly being illegal.

I’m not saying it’s bad, I’m against the idea that anything artificial is inherently worse than natural, but if some people prefers something to be natural, it is not okay to offer them an artificial alternative while telling them it’s natural."
5362,2020-12-03 04:34:53,k5lrl7,"this is pretty irrelevant to the point. OP just says they prefers people who have lighter skin, nothing about objective beauty (no such thing) and it doesn’t look like they were trying to convince you that any race was more beautiful"

I'm saying that the narrative ""I am only attracted to X"" is really silly because humans will instantly forget their ""preferences"" when a person comes along that they look good enough. Or circumstances are dire enough


It's childish which is why I don't say ""this will always look better than this"" .

It's stupid and if you understand human nature or the nature of humanity you will know they will f just about any person when circumstances are right.


Like look at Jail, there are still women and porn magazines and everything and all they have to do is wait a couple of years but nope. Men who are not gay will up and decide that they are going to get something.

The desperation meter is not very high for men to just up and decide to f anything

I can almost guarantee the most racist KKK members will immediately turn on their morals and Fuck(likely rape actually) a black woman who looks good enough....... Because they have before.

5368,2020-12-02 19:26:58,k5g8tt,"Don’t refer to him using his deadname. You can refer to the characters he’s played using feminine pronouns and words, but not the man himself. So for example “I likes Elliot Page’s performance in The Umbrella Academy, he plays a character named Vanya. Vanya is such a cool character, she’s my favorite” if you want to specify that he was in the role before he came out, refer to it as “pre-transition” or “before he came out” instead of “when he was still a woman” etc."
5369,2020-12-02 19:25:57,k5g8tt,"Like on an IMDB page it would say Elliot Page as or credited as Ellen Page for those prior roles. Just like when an actor changes their name slightly, they might have credits under a different spelling or something."
5370,2020-12-02 19:27:33,k5g8tt,"You use their current name and pronouns. If someone has said that they no longer want to be called a particular name, it is rude to use that name to refer to them."
5371,2020-12-02 19:27:47,k5g8tt,"In general, its considered polite to use their new name retroactively. Elliot Page did those things, the same guy who is starring in Umbrella Academy also starred in Juno. We don't want to make it seem that someone else did the work instead."

5374,2020-12-02 17:47:03,k5e1kj,"I don't think anyone is saying that Caitlyn shouldn't be charged because she's ""not the same person as Bruce."" She wasn't charged because the LA district attorney declined to prosecute the case, saying it couldn't be proven that her driving was negligent. The issue has nothing to do with her being transgender, it boils down to the fact that a prosecutor declined to prosecute because they felt there wasn't enough evidence."
5375,2020-12-02 17:49:42,k5e1kj,"I can't find any sources that say Caitlyn Jenner murdered someone when she was known as Bruce.  At worst she committed manslaughter.

And it's not like she escaped consequences because of her transition.  They considered charging her, but didn't because she was driving below the posted speed limit.  She also lost a sizable wrongful death lawsuit (reportedly an $800,000 settlement).  None of the consequences she did or did not receive has to do with transitioning."
5376,2020-12-02 17:48:39,k5e1kj,"This view makes no sense.

The reason Caitlyn Jenner was not charged with manslaughter had absolutely nothing to do with her transitioning, and nobody thinks that trans people legally become different people when they transition. Your view is based on an absolutely baffling misunderstanding of how the legal system works. Caitlyn Jenner was never charged because she's rich and famous, not because she's trans."

Act like Someone named Bruce Jenner didn’t exist or was always named caitlyn? That’s denying her authentic story as well as her family’s.

Let’s not quibble because he didn’t SPECIFICALLY name the Trans community in an apology when the intent of his statement wasn’t to offend them. Did it? Some are offended, of course. He said sorry. 
I think it’s a little much to call it transphobia when the INTENT of his comment was, “if I wasn’t a man, I’d hit you, too.” He was trying to invoke some humor into an otherwise, insensitive statement however, it wasn’t funny because abuse isn’t funny, and neither is ignorance."
5425,2020-12-28 19:06:05,klumue,In all fairness he could barely even get out the apology to the women with all the shouting. Andy could have tee’d up addressing the transphobic piece - you know like a good host would have - but he wanted to lean in to Gizelle’s stunt with her body guard.

5427,2020-12-28 19:07:10,klumue,"Nope he apologised for his comments. You can't just decide what you think he was or was not apologising for.

5461,2020-12-28 01:50:07,klcv17,"Honestly if there's one thing I've learned in all of this is that gender carries different meaning for each and every person. Nobody can tell you you are or are not trans because they can't know what this really *means.*

I'm not sure what you mean by hoping to prove you'll be happier by starting HRT. What do you think will happen exactly? By all means do it if you want to and I'll be out here banging the bodily autonomy drum until I'm dead, but I don't think that HRT is what makes you male or female. If you're hoping you wake up one day changed from it I just worry that you'll be disappointed? HRT takes a long time to have an effect and it's not punctuated by any specific marker, small stuff just happens bit by bit over a long time. I don't think hormones make anyone a woman or a man if it's missing a fundamental bit of agency and faith.

I definitely got hung up on the ""am I/aren't I"" angle of this for a long time and I think as you realize it's not always easy to answer. In the end I think I ended up preferring not giving that a yes/no answer because I became happier and more confident judging each step and taking each step on its own individual merits, and never really defended anything on the basis that ""I'm trans so it must be right"". I feel like that became a stronger foundation and I'm glad of that.

The existence of evidence or non-evidence a person's past might be insignificant in deciding what is right for a person compared with bigger questions like.. are they happier? Is transitioning helping them? Would you deny a person's transition to them if they didn't match up with the criteria you're examining yourself against?"

5463,2020-12-27 22:38:25,klcv17,"The only person who can tell you that is you. Try it out, have your friends call you by she/her. Wear some feminine clothes, try to see how it feels. If it feels right, then you know. If it doesn’t, maybe you’re gender fluid, or non-binary.

Over all, don’t force it, but enjoy it."
5464,2020-12-27 23:03:23,klcv17,"Holy shit are we the same person? I have legit had the exact same thoughts. I mean of all the people in the world of course there had to be more of us. But yea, I should really go to a gender therapist so I can talk this out. Can’t be good leaving all of this to yourself for 20 years."

And really good to read your experience of this in such detail. I’m trying to figure out how to talk to my long-term girlfriend about this, which I think will help. Have also booked a gender therapist for next month."
5467,2020-12-28 13:33:49,klcv17,I find lot of questions that I have raised also. And i recognise you as trans...however all questions and all answers are eithin you only
5468,2020-12-28 14:32:54,klcv17,"I have the same feeling as you. I want to be beautiful as a girl, but I am not sure if it's worth all the process of transitioning, or if it's just a fetish of mine.You see, when I was at school, all the girls bullied me because I was ugly. Then I started to watch porn of crossdressing and transgendering, and started to imagine being dessired as I desired those girls from my class. I just fell in love of how beautiful they were, and started to want to be beautiful as well. So I started to use my mother's panties, my sisters leggies, and so one. One day I was almost caught by my mother, which made me stop to crossdress.Now I am just wating to start to live alove and to forward and experience more crossdressing.If you want to talk more, I would be happy to have someone to talk about my personal doubt either.  
I want to be a girl, to be seen as one. But I am afraid of the consequences. If I fabrication of my trauma from school? If after the end of transition, I realize that I want to be father but can't anymore because I have become sterelized? It's just too much ifs. Because of that, I want to test by living alone and crossdressing fulltime. Just by testing how is to live as I girl I can decide if I want to be one."
5469,2020-12-27 23:17:47,klcv17,"Probably :), but when they are your own doubts, it just becomes difficult to dismiss them as excuses."
5470,2020-12-27 23:06:24,klcv17,"Thank you. I will do my best, although when you're someone like me who craves perfection, it is almost impossible not to pressure yourself lol."
5471,2020-12-28 03:24:49,klcv17,"Yeah, I probably did not explain that part about happiness too well. What I mean by ""hoping to prove \[I'll\] be happier by starting HRT"" is really just another part of trying to figure out a definitive answer to whether I am meant to be a girl, when the answer is much more complicated than one of immediate closure. Since I am not yet in a position where the need to change genders is taking a crippling effect on me, the main question that I am battling with is the thought experiment of which gender I will be happier as. I feel content as a guy, but being content is not the same thing as being happy, and so I am trying to find a way to change that. Of course, I still have all of college to get through before I really even enter the real world, so my entire identity is still being shaped, and my gender questioning has just become a part of that identity formulation. This leaves me with the task of deciding whether I would be happier as a man or a woman. In terms of names, pronouns, primary clothing, etc. I have learned that I would be happier as a woman, although still content as a man, which leaves the question of physical transition. This is not as easy to answer because I cannot simply do it without much thought, and thought experiments are not useful because they are tainted by idyllic views of what post-transition life would look like. The only way to know if I would truly be happier physically transitioning is by physically transitioning. I am aware that HRT is a slow process, and I have no assumptions that it will change me immediately; I would not want it to anyways. In fact, this is one of the great things about HRT in my opinion as it does offer a short period to see how I will feel about the changes, and I can moderate my pace. I also completely agree that HRT does not define the difference between male and female. As I mentioned in my post, I have no idea if we even can really define the differences between genders. To me, HRT just represents the next step, after seeing a therapist of course. I can present as a girl in public to see if I would be able to handle the societal pressure, but I already know that I want to express myself as a girl, and therapy will hopefully help me affirm my identity as a girl. Then, if everything feels right, but I just feel like it could be even better, HRT enters the picture, so the question becomes, ""Will this next step of HRT make a meaningful impact on me?"" Like you, I want to take everything on a step-by-step basis, so the question of whether I am trans is really about me finding an identity to help others understand. It makes explaining my feelings a lot easier in my opinion to be able to group them under one label, and while you are right that this is not the strongest foundation to construct my journey on, at the moment, I am honestly just too self-conscious to keep going forward without having a concrete idea of whether I am trans or not, especially when there is already a lot of risk following this journey. That self-consciousness and moving beyond the need for a label will hopefully be a part of my therapy. You also discuss how what is right for a person is much more significant than the vague question of whether one is happier, and while I agree in the sense that happiness does not always balance out with making the right decision (I mean, just look at all of the members of the LGBTQ+ community who lost family members while becoming their best self), I do think that there needs to be some cohesion between the two. As I mentioned briefly in my post about how one of my worries is whether a lack of passing would result in me becoming even more self-conscious and negate the positives of transitioning, there is a very real concern that just because I made the decision that was best for me, I might end up less happy than I was before. Do I risk contentment for a chance at greater happiness? I do not know right now, which is why I yearn for a way to define myself, even if while I am keenly aware that there is no definition that will match me perfectly except the one I create. I would certainly never deny transition to someone based on the criteria that I judge myself on, but I also tend to be much more critical of myself than others. I am the type of person who can give great advice, but never manage to take it for herself, so while it may seem almost hypocritical to internally refute my own questioning when I would affirm someone else with the same questioning, that has always been one of my personal flaws. I am sorry for the long reply, but as evident from my post, I tend to be pretty lengthy in discussions. If you have any more questions or if you would just like to further discuss what I wrote here, I would love to keep the conversation going."
5472,2020-12-27 22:41:26,klcv17,"I would love to do that, but I just have no clue how I would answer all of the questions that they are bound to ask. All of my own doubts would just add to any confusion they have. How exactly did you go about having the conversation?"
5473,2020-12-27 22:44:11,klcv17,"Judging from crossdressing in private and using female names online, it feels really good. I just do not know how to really classify what that enjoyment means. I am sure that experiencing it in-person with friends and family is a much different experience, so right now, my focus is just on consolidating my thoughts, which as evident by my entire post, is not going great."
5474,2020-12-27 23:05:06,klcv17,"Agreed, and it sounds like we could sorely use someone with similar questioning experiences too. Would you be willing to talk further in DMs? I figured that I was alone for so long with all of my doubts."
5475,2020-12-28 06:52:44,klcv17,"Thank you so much. You have no idea how much that first one helped. I had read the other three before, and all were useful, but they still fell short of really making me believe I was experiencing dysphoria. However, the first link perfectly captured the vague dysphoria I had been feeling and highlighted so many things that I just assumed were completely normal. It is just so nice to finally be able to confidently tell myself that I truly am a girl."
5476,2020-12-28 02:37:30,klcv17,That's great to hear. I really hope that your girlfriend is accepting of you!
5477,2020-12-27 23:23:28,klcv17,"Here's something. It's fine for you to not be completely 100% sure about your gender. At some point you just have to make a leap of faith. If you change your mind about your expression later, it's just because you realized after exploring that that particular gender wasn't the right fit for you. 

You got this, girl! 🥰"

5485,2020-12-27 22:58:30,klcv17,"Yeah, I know, and it is definitely frustrating, but it is always stated with the best intentions. I just know that many people who transition always say that they wished they had done it earlier, and earlier is always fading away. Especially when I do have concerns about passing, the timing of HRT gains additional importance."
5486,2020-12-27 23:21:14,klcv17,"Sometimes it can just be validating to know that those doubts and experiences are not unique to you. Obviously, no one has the exact same gender journey, but sometimes you just need to know that yours does in fact intertwine with others."

5488,2020-12-26 03:45:40,kkbojz,"Neither Benjamin or Dominic sound ""weird"" on someone your age. I think something like Maverick or Ryker or those types of names sound a bit ""off"" for someone almost 50, but that's about it. Even something like Jax--it would be unusual, but I can see a 1971 baby being named Jackson and ending up a Jacks/Jax. 

I think it's mainly a spelling thing. Caitlyn seems younger because of the Y. Like, she pronounced it differently, but Caitlin Thomas (Dylan Thomas's wife and an author in her own right) was born in 1913..."
5489,2020-12-26 03:45:59,kkbojz,I literally would not question a person with either of those names. I think as long as you don’t choose Oakley-Bear or Jayxxsunz you are good to go. I promise you are over thinking this and I have a stick in my rear when it comes to these names. Benjamin and Dominic are both names that suit any age right now.
5490,2020-12-26 03:41:57,kkbojz,"I mean, Benjamin seems like of timeless...does anyone think it’s weird that Benjamin Franklin is like 350 years old and his name is Benjamin?"
5491,2020-12-26 15:15:43,kkbojz,"I recently said this on another thread, but as long as a name existed when you were born, at least some people your age have it. Why shouldn’t one of those people be you? Uncommon in your generation does not mean unheard of or weird for your generation — and Benjamin and Dominic aren’t even uncommon in your generation, just less common than they are now! 

It would be one thing to meet a 49 year old named Nevaeh, since that name actually didn’t exist when she was born. People might think, “huh, that’s a bit odd.” But other than a situation like that, even people who are interested in names are not going to be thinking “hmm, Dominic has increased in popularity since this guy was born, ergo many Dominics are younger than him, ergo something is wrong here.” That just doesn’t make sense, and also the vast majority of people don’t know enough about name trends to even have that illogical thought process anyway!

Anyway, Benjamin and Dominic are both great names and I think they’d sound totally normal on you. Happy early birthday!!"
5492,2020-12-26 05:47:00,kkbojz,"I'm two years older than you and wouldn't find it the least bit odd to meet someone around our age named either Benjamin, with the nn Ben; or Dominic, with the nn Dom."

5494,2020-12-26 08:41:39,kkbojz,"I think the name Caitlyn actually makes sense for Caitlyn jenner - it was the early 80s when Caitlyn perhaps started to acknowledge herself, and started her long journey to coming out as trans. She may have secretly picked that name for herself at that time, when the name was more popular."
5495,2020-12-26 16:21:00,kkbojz,"I really love your thought process here, but I don’t think the two names you mention would raise the alarm in any way."

i will say that i love the name benjamin. it being super popular now doesn’t matter, i don’t think. 


i had the most popular girls’ name of my age group and i was always called “my first name, last initial” i’m school. so as long as you aren’t going to be in a grade school class, i think a name that is currently popular will be ok. 


dominic is great too! and i don’t think you’re overthinking here. i think you’re giving a great deal of attention to something that for better or worse, will set the scene when you meet new people."

5529,2020-12-22 23:09:25,kie689,"What can I say but ""have a hug of solidarity."" You are not alone.

I was \~18 when I first understood the ""normal"" amount of trans to be feeling was 0, and that's *with* having been exposed to transmasculine people for a while online.  Self-realization feels very strange, and some degree of panic is common.

Your story does sound distinctly like childhood social dysphoria. In practice, it doesn't actually *matter* if you've ""always"" been trans - the question is more what your current needs are.

Your mother's response to kids ""playing doctor"" was inappropriate, by the way; that's a developmentally typical curiosity, and teaching the social norm that nudity is not acceptable should be done gently.

Dysphoria tends to set off any latent mental health issues someone might have. Cis people can get it too - this is why most of the treatments available to trans people existed in the first place; we are not unique in missing or having lost pieces, and there are lots of health problems that can result in that happening. The kinds and level of mental illness that could lead to ambiguity about whether someone is having dysphoria are quite uncommon.

(By the way - having a mental health issue *does not make you less worthy of love and concern*, it means that you *need* more, just like someone with a broken leg can't be expected to walk independently.)

Good places to start - PFLAG chapters or Mermaids (UK) are a good place to contact. You will want a social group who knows how to love you as you are, not as they wish you were, before you seek further transition care. Local trans people will know who the 'safe' therapists are. Not all therapists follow the published guidelines by the major psychological supervisory associations, which are that affirmative care (affirmative of your *feelings*, whatever they may be, not a *blind* affirmation of *transness*) is the only appropriate approach for dysphoria.

**It helps with the 'waiting' aspect to reframe some aspects of the situation:**

* Your chest is here *now*, but not *only* will it eventually be off, *you* will get to choose exactly how that's done and who does it.
* 'male' and 'female' human bodies are the same except for a few internal tubes and the size of some organs. You already have a prince part, it just might need help to feel that way.
* ***your body belongs to you***. That means that nobody - not your mother, not a priest, not a partner, not a doctor, not the government - gets to tell you what's enjoyable to it and what isn't. If someone tries to make you have *their* feelings about your body, they are violating your boundaries and *they* are in the wrong.

EDIT: I recommend you look at the DSM V ""gender dysphoria"" diagnostic. I'm not going to fill it for you here, but I suspect it'll be a useful reference."

It was like lightning. I just knew this was for me. Oh I had known it was possible, sure but not for me. I wasn’t richer than god, I couldn’t ignore the rules of society but now I knew someone within one step of me who had.

They’re kind of looked down upon, and everyone can see through them. The Tyrells play both sides and stay neutral just like the Karjenners. All they want is more prestige and power. Even their motto “Growing strong” and the rose is very Karjenner. 

Kris reminds me of Olenna Redwyne: intense, social, and cunning. She does everything in her power to push the Tyrells up the ladder. 

Kim is Margaery, beautiful and really nice, has an extremely high EQ, and social climbs through relationships. 

Kanye reminds me of Dany, well intentioned but short sighted, inexperienced and entitled so he ends up doing damage. They both want to rule despite not having much support from the actual citizens.

I can’t really place the other ones, the GOT characters are so specific."
5539,2020-12-19 21:41:45,kgg7gx,LOL thanks for sharing. Absolute roast of Kourtney being Joffrey Baratheon 😂😂😂
5540,2020-12-19 21:36:43,kgg7gx,Omg JC as Littlefinger is too perfect. But I see Scott as a bit of a LF too.
5541,2020-12-19 22:26:28,kgg7gx,Oof I try not to think about GOT anymore since the finale because 😭🤮 but I love this
5542,2020-12-20 00:24:58,kgg7gx,Oo I love this!
5543,2020-12-21 07:00:48,kgg7gx,Jonathan as Little Finger. ☠️

This is perfect!! They are definitely Tyrells, not Lannisters or Starks. I was just comparing certain traits they share with the characters.


>Kris reminds me of Olenna Redwyne

I can't believe I forgot about 'tell cersei it was me'. Both icons!! Her cunning is more Olenna than Tywin.

>Kim is Margaery

This is the perfect Kim comparision. I was honestly struggling to place her, I even thought of Kylie as Margaery but then was like she doesn't have her charm or mind. Kim is perfect as her.

>Kanye reminds me of Dany, well intentioned but short sighted, inexperienced and entitled so he ends up doing damage

I really wanted a Dany comparision, and I could think of no one but then your comparision of Kanye makes absolute sense. A people's chosen hero gone wrong.

If any others come into your mind, you have to comment. Your comparisions really clicked!!"
5546,2020-12-19 21:38:39,kgg7gx,"JC as Littlefinger is the comparision that as soon as it clicked, I was like I have to write this down!!"
5547,2020-12-19 22:27:51,kgg7gx,"Read the books, if you're a reader, that way the pain is only about when the next book comes out (kinda like being a Kanye fan) and not how bad the finale was."
5548,2020-12-19 21:14:58,kgg7gx,"I think that too, but then I go do I start with Pathology or Medicine, do I do the research paper or do I do the assignment and the answer is nothing. So i do nothing."

5558,2020-12-19 04:45:51,kfzqpw,"1. Act natural. It sounds cliche but its true. People can smell fear more than you think and they respond to confidence. If you act weird and nervous, people might not clock you but they will be able to tell something is up. Throwing people like Caitlin Jenner under the bus (which btw is kind of a shitty move even if you're nervous) will end up raising more flags in the long run than just playing dumb or being neutral would.
2. 2. When possible, don't lie, omit. Sometimes it's unavoidable, but if you lie, you will invariably have to lie more to back up that lie. That will put you on edge and make you more nervous which again, will raise more flags. If you were a girl scout, don't say you were a boy scout. Say you were in 'scouts'. If your best friend was Rebecca, don't change it to Robert. Just say 'a buddy of mine'."
5559,2020-12-19 05:44:44,kfzqpw,"Idk just try and act natural I guess. 

A coworker of mine asked straight up in front of my other coworkers if I was trans (because some older coworker told her that I was, no real idea how she would know that, but okay, I can't ask her tho, since I never see her)
But I just responded with no, why would she think that? Huh?

And my manager, she just backed me up like ""no way, Raisin has a dick, which I don't, but nobody there knows that. 

It just turned to the coworkers making jokes about how the manager knew that, and thus my outing was evaded. 

I had no idea I could lie, but apparently I can sometimes. 

Honestly would have told the coworker the truth if she hadn't asked in front of everybody, she's not transphobic/homophobic whatsoever, I guess she just lacked the thoughtfullness or something about asking it in front of everybody. 

But she later apologized and said I could just tell her to shut up. 

I believe we were talking about how ourselves in matter of sexuality and stuff, so she just was like, hey now that we're on that subject anyway, might as well ask."
5560,2020-12-19 08:25:01,kfzqpw,"I agree with the act natural point. Also, in my experience cishet guys tend to be pretty straightforward with their banter. Sometimes they even call each other ladies as a way of making fun of each other. As a trans guy that would make the hair on our necks stand up but you gotta learn to punch back. Sounds like that guy was joshing you. I am still early in my transition so getting used to how guys treat each other, but as you get further in your transition and more confident I hope you will be able to banter back. I don’t think being supportive of trans people is much of a red flag unless you’re around a ton of right wing people all the time. Then you might stand out. Just don’t go around with trans flags haha. 

if a guy misgendered a trans person to get a rise out of people/“trigger the liberals” you could smirk/roll your eyes and say “ooookay, Ben Shapiro.” Or “that’s so edgy you might cut yourself” Something like that. Not the exact situation you mentioned, but you get the idea"
5561,2020-12-19 11:43:57,kfzqpw,"HR should be discrete, if they find out you are trans.  My sister and my best friend have backgrounds in HR, and would never tell anyone on the job if they knew.  It’s basically unethical in that field.  My name has been changed for a while now; I’ve even had my name changed in my college records.  I can’t change the past, but that is not the present.  I work in a medical field and have had so many background checks, I don’t even have a count.   It’s never come up."
5562,2020-12-19 19:17:25,kfzqpw,"I've had multiple background checks over the years. I do not put my birth name. And I have never seen my birthname come up.

Over here unless you're getting hired by the FBI or something it's probably just some third party the company hired. You need to just give them enough info search their database. 

The checks don't list anything outing. It just list stuff like


Sex Offender search: Clear


Global Watch List: Clear

Felonies: 0"
5563,2020-12-19 05:25:05,kfzqpw,"I never go out of my way to say transphobic things about other trans people and never bring them up myself. But I think being too supportive would also raise flags. But one problem is I feel like using gender neutral pronouns too often gets noticed. Like if I mention I played tennis in high school I can just say teammates, but if I were to tell a story about anything and I used gender neutral for everything that would raise eyebrows too.... Once I accidentally kinda said my season was in the fall (not at this job but somewhere else I didn't stick around long), but the guys season is in spring. That did not get caught luckily cause the other guys didn't play tennis so I guess they forgot. At this point I'm thinking mentioning my time in tennis at all is a no go. But it just sucks theres so much in my life I can't really talk about..."
5564,2020-12-20 10:21:53,kfzqpw,">don't say you were a boy scout. Say you were in 'scouts'.



There are some girlscout troops who accept boys too (mine did as a kid) so even saying girlscouts won't necessarily out you. But I do agree that just saying ""scouts"" it's better. But if you slip up, you can just cover it up with that."
5565,2020-12-19 21:06:02,kfzqpw,"ok that's good to hear, because I did have a background search done for an internship through school and I got my results back and my current name and my dead name came up under home addresses. (My internship didn't see it, only the school)"
5566,2020-12-19 05:36:46,kfzqpw,"No one's saying you gotta be a full on activist but misgendering someone else isn't going to help you. And to be fair, you did go out of your way to be transphobic. Everyone has bad moments, but there was no reason you needed to call Jenner a ""dad"". You could have said 'parent' or acted like you did know who she was. The honest truth is you originally said mom but kinda wimped out and said 'dad' because you wanted acceptance.

If you are worried about passing 100%, then workout and get bulkier. Nobody around you is thinking about this as much as you are. Sometimes there might not be a way around lying but there is never an excuse for misgendering someone on purpose."
5567,2020-12-19 05:51:29,kfzqpw,"I do pass 100%, I said I was surprised I don't get clocked on it. I already do work out so telling me to isn't helpful. Saying parent didn't come to mind at the time and what I meant was I wish I would've thought of that but didn't in that very split second of convo. And you are right to say I did wimp out, I'm not denying it."

5577,2020-12-17 15:04:13,keyxkl,"True. But as the comment clearly states, it's quite a hurdle to adapt. The older one comes out as trans, the harder it will be to use their new name. Therefore, one shouldn't always presume intent. And when it comes to discussing things said people did before transition, there has to be a method of using their former names in a polite manner..."
