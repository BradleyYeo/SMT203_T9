0,2020-02-04 08:14:47,eym4qt,"Whenever or not there will be a GL movie alongside with a show remains to be confirmed, like they are still at the stage working out if they can make something. 

The other thing is...  Well, Berlanti and Johns were also involved in making the last GL movie and depending on how much they had to say over it, are the signs promising? (And remember back then was when Johns was in the middle of his big GL run and the movie was supposedly going to launch the DCEU... till it all collapsed in a big fire at the BO.)"
1,2020-02-04 11:01:47,eym4qt,"It was never the case. Just speculation from people who love to spread DC negativity.

I hope the movie and show tie in together.

Hal & John in the movie. Guy and a couple of the other human lanterns in the tv show."
2,2020-02-04 07:04:28,eym4qt,Yeah we know
3,2020-02-04 06:57:45,eym4qt,"All of this is said now, but if a Green Lantern series becomes a big hit for HBOMax, a streaming service that would like to create cinematic television, the film could just be shelved while focusing on the TV side of things and just create a rich universe through that."
4,2020-02-04 19:55:09,eym4qt,HBO Max Show will likely Be connected to GL Corps Movie
5,2020-02-04 20:59:37,eym4qt,I swear it feels like Warner's is a bunch of different companies with how uncoordinated they are.
6,2020-02-04 12:36:26,eym4qt,They started writing the first episode on the Green Lantern HBO max series and the film script is finished. My bald prediction: Greg Berlanti will end up directing the Green Lantern Corps movie and will be a producer on the series.
7,2020-02-04 16:43:51,eym4qt,Johns didn't come aboard until the film was nearly completed.
8,2020-02-04 06:59:07,eym4qt,The thing about the Green Lantern lore is that it‚Äôs so expansive and there‚Äôs so many Earth based GLs that they COULD still do both and not retread the same ground.
9,2020-02-04 07:06:25,eym4qt,"I disagree with you, i think we will have both a Green Lantern HBO max series and a film the same way we will have Dune series and a film."
10,2020-02-04 21:22:43,eym4qt,Why?
11,2020-02-04 07:03:25,eym4qt,"Not saying they couldn‚Äôt, but they may also view a successful series on HBOMax as a way of providing a product for Green Lantern while having that space for a GL film for another character instead. If they utilize these options to the *max* (üòâ), they could showcase a number of characters in the future through films and TV shows that both have a cinematic quality to them without trying to have one version of GL or Flash while having this other version of GL or Flash(using Flash as just another example, mind you. Doubt we will see another Flash series after The CW‚Äôs series ends)."
12,2020-02-04 07:08:26,eym4qt,That‚Äôs not the best of examples as the Dune series is a prequel.
13,2020-02-04 21:38:58,eym4qt,I don't know why they're at odds with each other
14,2020-02-04 07:07:20,eym4qt,"Yeah, I think that‚Äôs certainly possible but if they want to still have a semblance of a DCU on screen (connected or not), they‚Äôre going to have to offer a film-based GL at some point."
15,2020-02-04 07:15:23,eym4qt,"> ‚Äúwill span several decades and focus on the origin stories of two major Green Lanterns on Earth.‚ÄùShe added it will also feature Sinestro, a major villain from the comics.

Sounds like a prequel to me."
16,2020-02-04 21:47:52,eym4qt,They are not. We just don't yet if they turned the movie script into a tv show or there will be both a tv show and a movie that will be connected.
17,2020-02-04 07:11:11,eym4qt,Why couldn‚Äôt they just bring in characters from the television side for the films though?  That‚Äôs seemingly what Disney is hoping to accomplish with a character like Ms. Marvel or Moon Knight. WB could try to do the same and only bring in the television characters for team-ups.
18,2020-02-04 07:43:07,eym4qt,"Actually it doesn‚Äôt. The several decades could start on 2020 and move towards the future.

You‚Äôre reaching."
19,2020-02-04 21:52:56,eym4qt,"Yeah the landscape is shifting to the point where I think that may be possible but with streaming currently being a money losing investment to start, I think they‚Äôd want to still release films that could be profitable in the short term as well as streaming shows that‚Äôll turn a profit down the line. 

That being said I definitely hope this will be one case where they still follow Marvel‚Äôs example and crossover their HBO Max characters with the films for crossover events. Or even guest starring roles in solo films."
20,2020-02-04 07:45:23,eym4qt,Hmm no
21,2020-02-04 08:09:31,eym4qt,*ok*
22,2020-02-04 03:07:44,eybjjd,Is the entire campaign co-op?
23,2020-02-03 21:50:40,eybjjd,Sweet! Been pretty excited for this one.
24,2020-02-04 14:40:05,eybjjd,"Never even heard of this game before and it got bat shit crazier by the second. 

""Oh, that zombie is resurrecting other zombies""

""Oh shit, that zombie has c4 charges on it""

""Oh shit, ZOMBIE SHARK?""

""Oh shit, ZOMBIE TANK?""

""Oh shit, ZOMBIE MAGE MASTER?""

""Oh shit, ZOMBIE HITLER?""

da fuq did I just watch?"
25,2020-02-04 15:00:35,eybjjd,I always enjoyed zombie army co-op so I am going to give it a go on PC. I still haven't managed to learn to aim properly with a controller and in this game headshots are essential...
26,2020-02-04 00:42:53,eybjjd,I was interested but it seems shallow
27,2020-02-04 12:17:53,eybjjd,Yes it is.
28,2020-02-04 13:26:00,eybjjd,far less shallow than what Wolfenstein has become
29,2020-02-04 14:06:45,eybjjd,Freedom Chronicles is where Wolfenstein lost its touch for me.
30,2020-02-02 20:11:06,exub61,Jokic is so fucking good. We are so lucky too have him.
31,2020-02-02 20:57:51,exub61,"I still remember how Beasley balled like crazy after he got his kid...
Harris played today like he just learned that kid is Bartons lmao"
32,2020-02-02 20:22:35,exub61,"A shooting guard who can't shoot.

Yes he is an above average defender, but you are going to struggle with an SG who hits 16.7%"
33,2020-02-02 20:14:59,exub61,"Gary Harris played 20 consecutive minutes to end the game. Ended with 3 points in 31 minutes on 1/6 shooting. 

Malik Beasley played 24 minutes the whole game, had 12 points, 4 assists, 1 rebound, 1 steal, on 5/9 shooting. 

Beasley did not see the floor in crunch time."
34,2020-02-02 21:37:14,exub61,Can‚Äôt ask much more from Jokic a 39 point triple double what the fuck
35,2020-02-02 20:14:24,exub61,"39/10/11 with 2 blocks and 3 steals

Take a bow Mr Jokic"
36,2020-02-02 20:45:59,exub61,"Let's lay some more beating on that long-dead horse of ""Nuggets vs sub .500 teams"", lol.

Not much to say. Exchanged fire in the 1st half, then things calmed down, but we still rushed things in the 4th there... still, you can't really blame the guys when we're 4 men down. Mental fatigue simply had to catch up to us at some point of a 3 games in 65 hours campaign. It'd happen to anyone.

Showed in the 4th big time, even if we won it. Even with all the guys sitting out, if we had a better chance to rest I'd say we could gain whole lot of momentum there. Probably talking ~30pts Q there.

Kinda similar to that Grizzlies L when I got downvoted for saying we lost that game more because of our inability to capitalize on their mistakes consistently in the 3rd and early 4th, than for letting them roll all over us in the 1st... Still, I'm finding it hard to blame guys for this one... they won two big games, and they put up a solid fight tonight, and were basically two FTs away from 2nd OT (if we didn't miss those, we wouldn't need to foul near the end there, and I say it could be a 1 point game going into last 30 secs)...

And seriously, smh at yall calling for 'change' after this game with 2 starters, MPJ and Plumlee missing... All of you would take a 2-1 record for those last 3 games if someone offered it beforehand.

Anyway, let's get some well deserved rest and make sure we keep that streak of Melo not winning in Denver since he left, rolling."
37,2020-02-02 20:11:25,exub61,Just fucking give the ball to the most clutch player in the league
38,2020-02-02 21:09:21,exub61,"Another strong candidate for ""loss I couldn't care less about"""
39,2020-02-02 20:18:36,exub61,Morris with 19/7/7 and no turnovers. That‚Äôs nutty. So sad how far Gary and Juancho have fallen. We‚Äôd be a championship favorite if they still had their game.
40,2020-02-02 20:13:43,exub61,"just feel bad for nikola bro, 39/10/11 and a loss

also hate to beat this dead horse but we were +13 in his 40 minutes and -18 in the 13 he was off the floor, i know we have severe injuries but fuck man"
41,2020-02-02 20:13:33,exub61,"Lets be real, we‚Äôd rather beat Bucks and lose to Detroit than lose to Bucks and beat Detroit. Thank god we don‚Äôt play trash teams in the playoffs or this team would be strewed"
42,2020-02-02 20:34:22,exub61,I think Murray will thrive with the way our offense is playing now
43,2020-02-02 20:12:34,exub61,Why the fuck didn‚Äôt Malik start OT? The team needed shooting
44,2020-02-03 04:01:13,exub61,"Let me tell you this, a healthy squad of NBA champions  would struggle to win 3 games in 60 hours, 2 of them being on the road, even if all 3 opponents were ""sub . 500"".  Great team effort, proud of the guys."
45,2020-02-02 20:10:38,exub61,He got a fine shot... but Barton should've passed to Jokiƒá at the end of regulation
46,2020-02-02 20:11:06,exub61,PUT GARY HARRIS ON A MILK CARTON!!!
47,2020-02-02 20:59:21,exub61,I wish Joker had a twitter so I could tell him how much I appreciate him showing up night in and night out for this team.
48,2020-02-03 04:01:47,exub61,Looks like Houston is shipping out Capella. That's good news for us. He's literally the only player on their team that can guard Jokic.
49,2020-02-02 20:14:12,exub61,"Not surprised by the loss after playing 3 games in 4 days ,missing MPJ/Plumlee/Murray/Millsap ..But  feels we like had it wasted great Jokic game (39pts 10/11 TD) on 70 % shooting..

I blame Barton for not passing to Jokic in last possession before the OT for the game winner ,the guy who was shooting 88 % at that point and who hits pretty much every game winner..And was open!Overall we also didn't pass to Jokic as much as we could 23 shots i mean most stars shoot 30+even and Jokic was on fire.

Gary got way too much minutes ,Craig got 18 while Gary 32??Meanwhile Gary is shooting 16 % ,Craig 60 % and was one of our guys in +...Why the hell did Malone benched him and kept Harris i dont get it"
50,2020-02-02 21:15:28,exub61,I hate fucking floaters.
51,2020-02-02 20:15:08,exub61,At least we don‚Äôt play at Little Caesars Arena lol
52,2020-02-02 21:14:13,exub61,I think to some degree mpj s absence has shown the impact he has been making. If he plays we probably win.
53,2020-02-03 03:08:56,exub61,"And Kansas put the final nail into the crap day coffin.

Don't get why they went away from the run.

Garoppolo was never going to beat Mahomes throw for throw."
54,2020-02-02 20:11:28,exub61,"Harris 31 min, 3 pts. Yikes"
55,2020-02-02 20:12:19,exub61,"Not even a game if our starters are healthy. I can live with 2-1 in the last three, just sucks because we could‚Äôve had all three. On to the next.

Jokic with ten triple doubles on the season!"
56,2020-02-02 20:14:45,exub61,Another example of the extremes this team is capable of.
57,2020-02-02 20:22:23,exub61,‚ô´ Gary come back. You can blame it all on me ‚ô´
58,2020-02-02 20:27:50,exub61,"I mean shit we lost. Jokic looked awesome. I'm focused on that Portland game and hoping we get mpj back. I also really miss Jamal. 

If the team is choosing to play it so safe getting players back to health we are gonna lose some games like these and that's the trade-off. I hope it pays off in the playoffs! It likely will."
59,2020-02-02 21:29:48,exub61,"With all the injuries and insane schedule it's hard to be upset over this loss. Good game boys (not you Gary),get some well deserved rest."
60,2020-02-02 20:11:02,exub61,All Barton had to do was give the ball to Jokic for the game winner. But he had to take a dumbass floater instead.
61,2020-02-03 04:04:05,exub61,Finally had to just unfollow TJ McBride. He‚Äôs over the top too often

Can‚Äôt wait for the ASB.

On to the next one!!!

Jok is a god. Without him we wouldn‚Äôt be where we are at. I love you."
64,2020-02-02 20:12:34,exub61,"Props to Joker

Fantastic triple double

and to Monte to

lots of other solid performances but wtf was that Garris."
65,2020-02-02 20:15:32,exub61,Just glad the team took 2 out of the last 3. Team looked gassed all around in OT. On to the next...
66,2020-02-02 20:20:21,exub61,"I think it‚Äôs totally okay to be mad Denver lost this game. I‚Äôm tired of Colorado being a just Broncos Country and the rest of the teams. The reason it‚Äôs that way is because the Broncos are held to a higher standard. Tolerating losing for the Broncos seems to be a lot lower and I think we should have those same expectations for the Nuggets. This team is too damn good to be losing to teams like the Pistons, and the Cavs. Yes we have injuries, but the Joker is capable of 40 point triple doubles. I‚Äôd think for a team known for its depth, the depth would‚Äôve helped tonight. 

Let‚Äôs go get Portland and make sure Melo enjoys the playoffs from his couch again this season."
67,2020-02-02 20:23:04,exub61,"They shot crazy well and Harris was beyond rusty. At least Joker continues to look amazing. 

On to the next one."
68,2020-02-02 20:25:40,exub61,"Sucks we lost. Sucks I saw it, but I saw a Jokiƒá triple double and Monte play well. I'm happy with it."
69,2020-02-02 21:35:01,exub61,"Can't really blame the guys with so many of them being injured. All we needed tonight was either Plumlee to slow down Dre when Jokic is out or MPJ to stop the total collapse, again when Jok is out. Hell, if Jokic didn't get those two fouls in the first even that might've been enough."
70,2020-02-02 20:13:47,exub61,I've given Gary the benefit of the doubt this far into the season but today was brutal...and I cant comprehend how Malone just let him smolder for 30 minutes
71,2020-02-03 00:53:19,exub61,So Rockets shipping Capela to the East?

We should have played TC3 and PJ way more this game because literally every time Juancho comes in nothing good ever happens outside of one fluke game against the Bucks.

I get Coach wants to trust in him to find his shot, but how many games has he scored more than 15 points this season as a starter? I get he's got good defense, but his defense hasn't won us a game. It's an offense first league which is why we've said goodbye to munders."

107,2020-02-03 03:35:39,exub61,"There‚Äôs just so much in the air for this offseason with us. We have Millsap, Jerami, Beasley, Plum and to a lesser degree Jauncho potentially leaving. I think we don‚Äôt need to make a huge trade but we need to consider what the fuck our bench is gonna look like next year and maybe make a trade to strengthen it. If we get Covington I think that‚Äôs a great piece to have as a pure Craig upgrade. If we retain Jerami I think our wings are pretty set but who the fuck is gonna be coming off the bench for the front court? If our starters are Jamal, Barton. MPJ, Grant and Jok we would really have no big guys coming off the bench. A Monte, Gary, Covington bench is a good start but damn we better get a good big man. If we actually make a big trade for a guard-which I think is smart since we have so many fucking guards-we will still need to fill the Millsap/Plum departure. I heard that Atlanta is considering trading John Collins. That would be insane if we could get him without getting rid of Jamal/MPJ/Jok. And then Jerami could still be coming off the bench. 

If we aren‚Äôt going to re sign Millsap we have a huge movable expiring which would give us a massive trade piece. If we wanted to go after Jrue and even take a shitty contract from the Pels I would be down. Like a Gary, Beasley, Millsap and a draft pick for Jrue and an ugly contract. None of those guys are really in our top 5 rotation players so it makes sense but I don‚Äôt think the Pels would be down to take that unless we throw in a future 1st. But damn there‚Äôs a lot of movement on our own team to consider."
108,2020-02-02 21:08:39,exub61,"gotta love the flaming hot, shit the bed takes today"
109,2020-02-02 20:11:03,exub61,"This team is gonna be so frustrating to watch when all the injured guys get back and throw the rhythm off even more. Just look at Gary, sure he sucks in general, but tonight he killed the team completely."
110,2020-02-02 20:12:02,exub61,Nobody should be surprised at this loss. This has been the Nuggets Mo all season. But it is becoming more and more apparent that Gary Harris should not be on this team after the trade deadline or his role needs to seriously be reduced.
111,2020-02-02 22:07:13,exub61,Just hoping the 49ers win to grab some small crumb of comfort back. Lets go Emmanuel.
112,2020-02-02 20:17:39,exub61,"Gary ‚ÄúG league‚Äù Harris

Fee games would do him good"
113,2020-02-02 22:33:24,exub61,"The Warriors only won one chip before KD. Good GMs actively go out there to make their team better and don't sit pat.

If KD doesn't join GS, Houston go back to back instead.

The trade deadline is coming up and we need a consolidation trade."
114,2020-02-02 21:31:26,exub61,"One loss and the #FireMaloners, #BenchBartoners, and #TradeGaryforJrue crowd clamors to be the first to claim their scapegoat as the one that needs to be sacrificed."
115,2020-02-02 20:19:17,exub61,"Shows how important MPJ is to the team. Oh well, 3 games in basically 3 1/2 days is a hard ask for any team. Jokic is a god.

Also, all y'all fuck off with your Gary hate. Guys been here since the beginning of the rebuild and y'all are hating on him like he killed somebody. He'll show up when he needs to, just like he did in the playoffs last year."
116,2020-02-02 20:10:53,exub61,"Send Gary to the G league for a couple games, thanks."
117,2020-02-02 20:12:08,exub61,Damn you guys really hate Garris
118,2020-02-02 20:14:56,exub61,I love Gary but moach played him to much. Not the reason we lost or anything but was obvious he was not in it today
119,2020-02-02 20:22:19,exub61,"From heroes to zeroes, thanks Gary & Barton....

Gary has regressed so far offensively that his defense can‚Äôt make up for it anymore. At this point, he should just be coming off the bench.

Barton just had to give Jokic the ball on the last possession and we wouldn‚Äôt have been in overtime. But he wanted to be the hero. Though it was a good look for a floater (which this team sucks at making....).

We definitely miss MPJ‚Äôs scoring and rebounding capabilities. A super hot Lillard is coming into town on Tuesday, hope we‚Äôre ready for that."
120,2020-02-02 21:16:31,exub61,We win this game easily without Harris. Too bad the boat on Jrue pased
121,2020-02-02 20:13:21,exub61,"Team really looked fatigued down the stretch. It's been a rough run for the team, getting back Milk Daddy and Murray down the stretch will be huge."
122,2020-02-02 20:24:27,exub61,"Q1 pts were double the average of Q2, 3 & 4 , yeesh"
123,2020-02-02 20:11:27,exub61,How can barton have this low bb iq it's beyond me
124,2020-02-02 20:19:41,exub61, I dont understand why Barton thinks he should take the last shot? He aint Jokic.. Garry performance was disrespectful to his teammates and  fans. Tired of losing to garbage ass teams. We dont have championship  mentality.
125,2020-02-02 20:11:53,exub61,No one gives a shit about great back to back wins against good teams if you drop dumbass games against these teams. This is why no one takes us seriously and probably won‚Äôt until we actually do something in the playoffs
126,2020-02-02 20:12:15,exub61,Shoutout to Gary Harris running around doing a whole lot of nothing and fucking my picks
127,2020-02-02 20:17:45,exub61,"Has Gary ever had a worse game in a Nuggets uniform.

Time to look to trade him."
128,2020-02-02 21:14:46,exub61,"so Gary's been absent for the birth of his son. There's clearly other things on his mind right now. y'all shitting on him HARD in here, should be ashamed of yourselves"
129,2020-02-02 21:27:12,exub61,The G in Gary Harris should stand for G League
130,2020-02-02 20:29:57,exub61,I think Malone has tendency to completely forget about the players on the court and on the bench. I took him Booing from the crowd in the last playoffs to bench Barton who was injured and sucking... and same thing happens today with Gary!?:O I am sorry to say this but i think Malone has lost us at least couple of these winnable games against bottom dwelling teams with his weird  defensive rotations:O
131,2020-02-02 20:13:06,exub61,Ugh. We show that we‚Äôre a contender with back to back wins against really good teams and then do this shit after being up by a ton to start the game.
132,2020-02-03 15:07:26,exub61,"I don't know how these trades will go, there is all sorts of speculation. What i personally would like is for Jokic, Murray, MPJ, Grant, Dozier to be untouchable for many years to come."
133,2020-02-02 21:14:48,exub61,"At this point, i have to surmise that Garry is going through some heavy personal or family troubles. Otherwise i cannot explain his lack of form this season, unless there is some unreported nagging injury, in which case sit him for the 20 games and let him sort it out"
134,2020-02-02 20:14:50,exub61,I am so pissed at Harris and Barton
135,2020-02-02 20:11:46,exub61,"Nugglyfe never forgives.

This is the way."
136,2020-02-02 20:11:59,exub61,"Yes, the loss was expected, but it's just much worse to give us hope and then take it away. Honestly I'd rather load manage Jokic and get blown out like other teams do than lose like this."
137,2020-02-02 20:18:31,exub61,"I‚Äôm just so sick of playing down to our opponents and not knowing how to play with a lead, even with all our players out there‚Äôs no way we should have lost this"

139,2020-02-02 22:19:46,exub61,I remember Malone resting the starters against Portland except Gary and Barton and Gary was solid since (until he got injured again). I know fact it's a confidence thing
140,2020-02-02 20:11:41,exub61,"The team is super young, and several injuries. Can't be shocked by the loss to a lesser team."
141,2020-02-02 20:12:43,exub61,"So unfortunately Gary Harris has no trade value because he‚Äôs played like shit. We can‚Äôt afford to keep Beasley and Harris, so we‚Äôre stuck with Harris for another  2 years and we‚Äôll lose Beasley."
142,2020-02-02 20:17:09,exub61,"Pistons are trash and yet... Pitchforks should be out tonight. Malone really has terrible instincts on timeouts, his timeouts have zero impact on opposing teams runs."

145,2020-02-02 20:20:08,exub61,Quick post all your hot takes below: I‚Äôll give you the insider scoop on why they are trash and how to quit being such a cuck. I‚Äôll even do this for the low price of $0.00.
146,2020-02-02 20:17:11,exub61,Denver is a Will Barton and Gary Harris trade away from championship
147,2020-02-02 20:14:11,exub61,"Had a great chance, could've won it in regulation but that's just how it goes. Looking forward to the guys bouncing back on Tuesday against the blazers"
148,2020-02-02 20:13:01,exub61,"I rather lose to the Bucks and win against the Pistons tbh

Just a frustrating game. Jokic 40 point tripple double, +13 and we lose"
149,2020-02-02 20:15:52,exub61,Fuck you Barton !
150,2020-02-02 20:21:01,exub61,Worst local broadcast in the US.  So whiny and biased.  It‚Äôs like listening to two Nuggets fans complain for two hours during a bad game
151,2020-02-02 20:28:52,exub61,"Btw when are we gonna talk about the shocking development of getting a ton of injury-prone guys and then having to deal with injuries constantly? Maaaaaybe get someone healthy next time?

I'm kinda scared they're gonna run Jok into the ground before the playoffs even start."
152,2020-02-03 03:52:23,exub61,"Trade machine:

Nuggets get:
Danilo Galinari
Andre Roberson
Joe Harris

OKC gets:
Millsap
Gary Temple
Draft pick

Nets get:
Gary Harris

OKc gets a better offensive guard.

Nets get a SG upgrade.

We get gallo for the playoff push and A great backup PF for next year"
153,2020-02-02 20:13:56,exub61,Not surprised we lost today. That sentence alone makes me kinda sad that these are the expectations I have for this team.
154,2020-02-02 21:37:53,exub61,Over the last 30 games he is averaging something like 23/10/7 on 55/39/80. I truly believe he is the best center in the game
155,2020-02-02 22:21:28,exub61,üòÇüòÇ
156,2020-02-02 20:27:35,exub61,"Yeah he'd need to be at least as good as Andre Roberson was defensively for it to even out. And at his height that's not going to happen. Not sure what the team does going forward. Do we continue to see if he can get out of a 2 year 'slump' that seems to be getting worse, or do they cut their losses and move forward with different players? They could bench him, but that could make the already offense-challenged bench struggle even more."
157,2020-02-02 20:28:31,exub61,Craig could have soaked up some of those minutes while also being a stronger body on defense. Not to mention he earned more playtime after stepping up all this time. I don't like the too far harris hate though.
158,2020-02-03 00:45:20,exub61,Now's the time to try to get Gary going. Even if it means a loss to Detroit.
159,2020-02-02 20:22:48,exub61,What‚Äôs your point
160,2020-02-02 23:21:53,exub61,"dude didn't deserve to lose

was absolutely exhausted near the end but was still bringing it.

we are so blessed to have him"
161,2020-02-02 20:56:18,exub61,"bro get out of here with such a reasonable take. :)

but honestly your right. We are tired because we are playing men down.

We will be much better after the all star break."
162,2020-02-02 21:10:58,exub61,thank god someone here has a level head
163,2020-02-03 01:20:57,exub61,What's your opinion on today's game if MPJ was healthy and played?
164,2020-02-02 21:26:36,exub61,Every time we beat the Jazz I give the Nuggets a 2 game free pass to not bother me no matter what happens
165,2020-02-03 06:12:55,exub61,"I hear ya but bealess wizards, basically roseless pistons.  I know out schedule but we were up 20+this game, shouldn't have ended like this"
166,2020-02-03 02:55:10,exub61,"I get roasted every time I suggest that we'd be better off without either of them.  Yeah we all got favorites.. I'd love for them to still have 
Faried but thats just not the reality of the situation."
167,2020-02-02 20:18:00,exub61,"I mean there was a line-up out there in the first half with Vando, Dozier, and Juancho. 3 guys that really shouldn't see time, let alone together. 

And it's not like it was an important enough game to run the starters into the ground. Not much to be done but hope guys get healthy"
168,2020-02-02 20:20:29,exub61,Part of that is Plumdog‚Äôs absence üò≠
169,2020-02-02 20:44:24,exub61,What will happen when Murray is back he will be one taking 20+shots  with not great % while Jokic will be on 10-12.Hopefully he can play more like a PG and pass first like Monte & Dozier but if he didn't in all this years ..i dunno when will he
170,2020-02-02 20:16:18,exub61,And legs
171,2020-02-02 20:13:10,exub61,"I agree with ya, it would have been a higher percentage shot, but Barton had a fine look too, can't fault him for taking it"
172,2020-02-02 20:20:42,exub61,Barton has been huge for us but we need him to be better in clutch situations like this. This will cost you in the playoffs.
173,2020-02-02 21:06:55,exub61,"For nuggets fans it would be awesome, but theres a LOT of jokic slander on there. Probably wouldn't be good for him."
174,2020-02-02 20:18:50,exub61,to be fair he created a good look. it just didn't go down.
175,2020-02-03 04:27:42,exub61,"Gary‚Äôs floaters are the fucking worst. I reMember watching him put that tool in his tool belt this preseason and it looked wrong. He still does that shit. He takes bad, circus shots that just don‚Äôt make sense. Maybe he just needs someone to tell him to play regular basketball and not Globe Trotter shit and he‚Äôll be back to at least average"
176,2020-02-02 22:20:58,exub61,"As much as it sucks after today to accept this as truth, how awesome is it that we have a rookie that we already miss when he misses a game. Health willing, we got ourselves another special player in MPJ that will only get better with experience."
177,2020-02-03 03:20:34,exub61,"They loaded the box, wanting Garoppolo to throw."
178,2020-02-02 20:21:05,exub61,It‚Äôs bad. He has almost no value offensively it‚Äôs sad to watch.
179,2020-02-02 20:13:08,exub61,You know the Pistons have injuries too right?
180,2020-02-02 20:28:27,exub61,I miss the 17-18 Gary so much üò¢
181,2020-02-02 20:33:05,exub61,I just hope we dont lose Yok to some injury  by the time everyone gets healthy:(
182,2020-02-02 20:22:19,exub61,"Barton tried to be the hero too often. We need him to take those shots when there‚Äôs nothing else there, not when Joker is wide the fuck open."
183,2020-02-03 04:47:36,exub61,"Yeah i unfollowed him a while back, telling him it was about him putting scores in his tweets and thus, spoling it for non-american followers.

He replied back i shouldn't be on twitter if i don't want to be spoiled. 

I told him no, it was a notification and i solved it by not following him anymore. Poor form and response imo."
184,2020-02-03 05:23:33,exub61,"I keep following him purely because he has news very consistently, however every once in a while he has some tweets where I have to read them several times before believing them"
185,2020-02-03 04:29:32,exub61,"he‚Äôs a mess. I agree with his politics, and I chose to unfollow him months ago. I think he‚Äôs fairly young, which is good. I hope for his well-being that he can direct his passion toward more constructive endeavors than all-caps screaming into the echo chamber"
186,2020-02-03 09:18:43,exub61,Proud of you man. Think I blocked him on Twitter early last year. Knows very little about basketball too.
187,2020-02-04 16:39:34,exub61,"That's a shame, you're missing out. He breaks info early and has a good relationship with some of the players."
188,2020-02-02 20:24:37,exub61,"TC or Beasley should of played in OT instead of Gary. Gary needs to be traded, they should throw in Juancho just to get a decent player."
189,2020-02-02 20:30:12,exub61,Wanted to punt my cat after that loss.
190,2020-02-02 21:03:36,exub61,I think he is giving him the benefit of the doubt like he did with Barton. He also benched Barton for Craig to wake him up which he may need to do the same and swap Beasley in because it‚Äôs costing us games. This literally erases the crucial win we got in milwauke. So frusturating.
191,2020-02-03 02:09:17,exub61,That would be huge for us. Capela makes it harder to defend them.
192,2020-02-02 20:17:05,exub61,Yep the offense Malik gives us is more valuable than Harris‚Äôs defense
193,2020-02-02 20:19:01,exub61,Gary has no trade value. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre fucked. And we can‚Äôt afford to sign Beasley unless we trade Gary.
194,2020-02-02 20:20:12,exub61,They should trade Gary and Juancho and get a pretty decent role player.
195,2020-02-02 20:13:24,exub61,I have more faith in Gary regaining his offense than Beasley developing his defense
196,2020-02-02 21:03:38,exub61,Coincidence we won against the Jazz and Bucks? Gary was not playing in both of those games? I think not...
197,2020-02-02 21:28:20,exub61,Who is going to take Gary at this point?:( pairing him with Juancho in a trade for Jrue would feel like a insult to Pelicans.
198,2020-02-03 01:17:26,exub61,Jrue wasn't all that good today though
199,2020-02-02 21:27:04,exub61,"Lmao chill dude. It's one loss, we're banged up, just had a brutal stretch of schedule, and we played at 10:30 am MST"
200,2020-02-03 00:25:41,exub61,Paternity*
201,2020-02-02 21:06:27,exub61,True. Looks the same on the stat sheet though. Nice if we could win both.
202,2020-02-02 20:42:32,exub61,"yeah not playing Craig instead Harris is mind boggling .,..He just showed us how good he is vs Bucks & Jazz..and he gets only 18 minutes ?? While he was shooting 66 % and one of the rare guys in plus. 

Meanwhile you have Harris cant buy a shot to save his life (16 %) on 32 minutes?? Its like Malone wanted to play him so he regains form or something even if it meant sure loss"
203,2020-02-03 05:25:30,exub61,"I have a hard time understating how badly I want Jrue Holiday, but I sincerely doubt we make any sort of trade"
204,2020-02-02 20:20:10,exub61,In Australia it's 7am on Monday. What a shitty start to the week for the Aussie fans
205,2020-02-02 20:25:10,exub61,Chiefs losing the Super Bowl would bring me right back to good spirits
206,2020-02-02 21:37:06,exub61,"I just can't believe how good jokic is, trully a gem. needs another top 20 player with him and his team will be a ring machine"
207,2020-02-02 20:15:01,exub61,Yea I think Harris is pretty worthless now. Who cares if he‚Äôs holds a guy to 22 instead of 28. When he doesn‚Äôt score it doesn‚Äôt matter how good his defense is
208,2020-02-02 20:38:08,exub61, Sadly I think it is only Malone who is left believing that only defense can win you games in the regular season at this point:(
209,2020-02-03 06:10:49,exub61,Nugglife. It's the basic Nugganomics
210,2020-02-02 20:12:24,exub61,Beating the jazz and bucks only to lose to the pistons is the most nuggets thing to do
211,2020-02-02 20:11:49,exub61,"No doubt in my mind. I had a bad feeling even after the 20 point lead, like it was too good to be true"
212,2020-02-02 20:13:11,exub61,Sub 500 team. Guaranteed loss
213,2020-02-02 20:13:14,exub61,"Yes, because we constantly shit the bed against terrible teams."
214,2020-02-02 20:18:30,exub61,I called it after the Grizz loss.
215,2020-02-02 20:21:34,exub61,Thought it‚Äôd for sure be an L until we went up 21. Got a false sense of security. Should‚Äôve known better.
216,2020-02-02 20:23:26,exub61,"I've seen it, but I'm still frustrated."
217,2020-02-02 20:23:23,exub61,"And the Wizards, and the Cavs"
218,2020-02-02 20:18:01,exub61,Please don‚Äôt remind me im already grieving
219,2020-02-02 21:04:18,exub61,Yeah these games will come back to bite us when it comes to playoff seeding. One game could be the difference between the 2 seed and the 5 seed
220,2020-02-02 20:25:34,exub61,He just had a kid so I‚Äôm blaming his poor sleep schedule on his horrible game. I‚Äôm still trying to come up with an excuse for the rest of the season though lol.
221,2020-02-02 20:14:03,exub61,Gary Harris ORPM this season... yeesh. Good defense though. Man it‚Äôs been a rough few seasons. Sour taste in my mouth after this game. That first quarter we played was unreal in the first five minutes.
222,2020-02-02 20:15:33,exub61,Third best DRPM for what it‚Äôs worth though
223,2020-02-03 03:56:01,exub61,Millsap is probably coming back next year on a team friendly deal
224,2020-02-02 22:21:21,exub61,"God there is some awful shit today. You'd think that 3 games within 60 hours all with major injuries right after two huge wins against top teams in the NBA would get people to back off a little, but damn if there aren't a lot of bandwagon folks who haven't watched a game before last season saying some garbage takes right now."
225,2020-02-02 21:12:28,exub61,"Yeah, maybe if his reserve was some Schlub, but we have a really talented prospect in Beasley that we can immediately put in to take his place."
226,2020-02-02 22:54:33,exub61,Fair to mention that GS also didn‚Äôt push all their chips in the year after their first playoff appearance as a core.
227,2020-02-02 22:44:40,exub61,"Problem is, who is out there right now that puts us over the top? Jrue and Beal aren't the answer. RoCo has been  having a bad year and is a mild upgrade on TC. Got to wait till next year when there are going to be actual stars available."
228,2020-02-02 23:15:20,exub61,"The loss sucks, but the team was visibly gassed this game. 3 games in 4 days is no joke, especially with so many key players out."
229,2020-02-02 21:54:10,exub61,TC gonna fuck all their worlds up and give them exactly what they asked for...a Plumlee/Harris/Barton for Chris Paul trade. /s
230,2020-02-02 21:38:19,exub61,They didnt know what to do with themselves the last 2 games
231,2020-02-02 21:50:10,exub61,And one of them just replied to your comment. Smh. Unreal some of these ‚Äúfans‚Äù on Reddit are.
232,2020-02-02 21:37:57,exub61,"This is not one loss.. this been happening through out the season:O Barton needs to realize  that he is not a SUPERSTAR on this team, but a role player. Malone on the other hand, I still like the guy, but we have to accept the fact that he has certain flaws(I hope he works around them). Gary is my second favorite player on this team, but he seems to be always hurt:( He is like a walking injury waiting to happen out there at this point."
233,2020-02-02 20:21:03,exub61,"I think the Gary feeling were warranted today, calling for his head and trades etc is too much but dude should not have been left in that long when he was ice cold"
234,2020-02-02 20:17:53,exub61,It‚Äôs not hate. He‚Äôs been awful. Terrible. He‚Äôs not playing like an NBA starting guard.
235,2020-02-02 20:19:36,exub61,"it was definitely the reason we lost, he fouled on that 3, had a spectacularly awful offensive game. Just play Beasley or TC3 and we win"
236,2020-02-02 21:32:55,exub61,We fucked up... Our FO needs to react faster on these kind of situations. They have tendency to hold on for too long on certain players. The fact is everyone except Yok should be tradable on this team.
237,2020-02-02 20:12:47,exub61,Story of nuggets life
238,2020-02-02 20:17:17,exub61,"Firstly, who gives a shit if outsiders take us seriously.  This isn‚Äôt college football where seeding or playoff placement is decided by a committee or the media.  Secondly, this was our 3rd game within a 62 hour window and we were down Murray, Millsap, MPJ, and Plumlee.  You really just going to ignore we smoked the bucks 18 hours after beating the jazz just because we dropped a strange ass road game to an eastern conference team?"
239,2020-02-02 20:13:05,exub61,"no one cares about your fantasy.

that‚Äôs rule one."
240,2020-02-02 20:19:05,exub61,His trade value must be at an all time low though. Shitty situation all round with him
241,2020-02-02 20:19:22,exub61,Drummond?
242,2020-02-02 21:25:50,exub61,"I think it‚Äôs okay to admit he hasn‚Äôt been good this season. 

People who think he will get traded this week are out of their minds though. No chance."
243,2020-02-02 21:26:44,exub61,"I don't blame him for this game, but let's be honest - he hasn't been playing, anywhere close to his normal level, for the most part (90%) of this season. I know he can be great so if he has some private stuff to deal with, ok, let him deal with that but give most of his minutes to Malik or Monte (or PJ) until he get his mind straight. That's it."
244,2020-02-02 22:06:39,exub61,What‚Äôs his excuse for last season then?
245,2020-02-02 21:30:56,exub61,"and let's also be honest with ourselves - with him playing like this and his non-expiring contract ( i think he has at least two years left) no one will take him. If he has personal issues, it wouldn't be humane or moral to chuck him like used empty can of coke. Bench him, give more time to Malik, Monte or PJ and lets wait. There must be a good reason why our Garry is not playing like Garris at the moment."
246,2020-02-02 21:36:22,exub61,Doesnt explain the last 1.5 years
247,2020-02-02 21:24:42,exub61,"He‚Äôs been bad all season, not just this game."
248,2020-02-02 20:17:36,exub61,"It‚Äôs not just one loss tho, it‚Äôs multiple. They just get their shit pushed in against teams under .500. They started the game really well but then shit hit the fan and they couldn‚Äôt play defense or make shots. It‚Äôs another one of their terrible games."
249,2020-02-02 20:14:42,exub61,I think if they don‚Äôt move Beasley before the deadline we will try to make him a future piece
250,2020-02-02 20:44:53,exub61,"His substitutions are sometimes way off. He keeps forgetting players on the bench and on the court. Overplays certain players, and completely ignores about the others."
251,2020-02-02 23:47:23,exub61,"Trade for WHO?  good lord.  Everyone says this, but who tf do you trade for to get you a championship caliber piece?

&#x200B;

Don't say Robert Covington either because he's ass this year and he's not stopping Lebron or Anthony Davis for 7 games."
252,2020-02-02 21:32:02,exub61,naw man thrill is not touchable
253,2020-02-02 20:31:09,exub61,I‚Äôd much rather beat the Bucks and lose to the Pistons. Who cares if we drop a game to a crap team while we‚Äôre exhausted and depleted? That win over the Bucks was magic.
254,2020-02-02 20:34:27,exub61,"> I rather lose to the Bucks and win against the Pistons tbh

This is a wild take.  You‚Äôd trade that fun win on Friday night for a win this morning against an irrelevant team?"
255,2020-02-02 20:14:44,exub61,"Yep. Sucks we couldn't capitalise on the Bucks win, but that win kind of negates this loss. Just a shame the way it happened. Blowing a big lead...wasting a monster Jokic game because most of the other guys were playing like garbage. And of course Gary continuing to be the most depressing storyline of the season.

On to Portland."
256,2020-02-02 20:22:38,exub61,That win against the Bucks means they can‚Äôt lose the season series. They just need to step up their game against shit teams.
257,2020-02-02 20:17:29,exub61,"Crazy how no matter how well Barton plays overall, he's still the player people turn on quickest when they're mad. He did some boneheaded shit, but this loss was more on other guys than him."
258,2020-02-02 20:22:32,exub61,Clearly you've never watched a game with the Rockets commentators.
259,2020-02-02 20:23:37,exub61,"Have you listened to every local broadcast in the US to make such a statement? If not, waste your time trying to listen to every broadcast rather than make dumb comments about local broadcast being biased please."
260,2020-02-02 20:31:37,exub61,If I was Yok I would have taken this game off... Go sightseeing in Detroit. Fuck this game
261,2020-02-03 09:41:00,exub61,[removed]
262,2020-02-02 23:49:03,exub61,"established long time already. At this point there isn't any argument, especially since Davis is definitely playing at 4. Embiid isn't healthy, KAT is a SG that doesn't win anything."
263,2020-02-02 20:40:07,exub61,They need to send him to the G league at this point.
264,2020-02-03 03:41:07,exub61,His contract is at least palatable for a trade partner but his stock is so low. He would be great for a contender. Everyone could use a defense first guard to come off the bench for 10 min a game. But we ain‚Äôt getting anything better than a shitty 2nd round pick. He won‚Äôt be the centerpiece but could be a nice add on for a trade. He‚Äôs really barely a starter at this point and whatever we get for him will probably just piss off casual Nug fans.
265,2020-02-02 20:30:40,exub61,"You don‚Äôt need to sound like a hater though, to wonder why a guy who hasn‚Äôt played the last few games got 20 consecutive minutes of run, especially when he was not lighting it up out there."
266,2020-02-02 20:29:42,exub61,I‚Äôm just throwing out some numbers. Feel free to draw your own conclusion from it.
267,2020-02-02 20:30:30,exub61,"That Beasley should be the one getting paid, and Harris moved on from."
268,2020-02-03 02:01:35,exub61,"It was half and I looked up and he had like 19/7/5. Didnt even seem like he was going off. Then at the end of the 4th he had, what 33/10/9? His scoring seems so effortless."
269,2020-02-02 21:15:19,exub61,"I think we'll be better by Tuesday already, or at least in better game shape.

5 more til the ASB. Thankfully they're spaced out a lot better minus the upcoming v.POR, @UTA back to back... Still tough with all the injuries but another silver lining is that we'll be in Denver for 4 days before the Lakers game so at least we won't have to go into that one with jet lag. Hope we put a good show there, would be a great way to tease the playoffs mode Joker and co.

Schedule gets a lot easier after the ASB, and the first B2B post ASB is all the way into late March... by then we should have our game roster refilled.

Dig in!"
270,2020-02-03 03:25:09,exub61,"Yeah, pretty sure he'd be worth at least one point in the regulation lol.

I mean it's not as simple as adding 'good' and subtracting 'bad', but to give it some context, we had like a couple steals in the 2nd half, and I don't think we converted any of those into points... mostly just bricked threes like 5 seconds into possessions... Even if that stayed the 'gameplan' I guess having MPJ would increase the likelihood of one of those going in... He'd probably draw some fouls on the inside too.

Still, much prefer him getting rest after that scare. Every W matters, but there wasn't anything particularly worrisome about this L given the context of this hilariously bad schedule for those past 3 games. Jokic looked locked in once again, so hopefully we can expect him to ride the momentum for those last couple games we got before the ASB (thankfully schedule is a whole lot better after it, and basically from Wednesday on)"
271,2020-02-02 21:51:28,exub61,He‚Äôs not really a PG though. He‚Äôs a SG naturally. Since we have Jokic running the Point already we need to run more stuff off ball for Murray. He seems to shoot better that way at least from outside.
272,2020-02-02 21:10:48,exub61,"Idk, it seems like monte doesn‚Äôt really pair well with jokic since he IS pass first which is why they have been having thrill run the point so much. I think the best version of this team is murray, Beasley, mpj, grant, and jokic starting 5, with tc and milsap being swapped in on a situational basis. That lineup would be athletic, long, space the floor, and complement jokic perfectly. We saw what that lineup minus Murray looked like against milwauke and Utah, and it looked really good."
273,2020-02-02 21:18:09,exub61,I dont think Jokic even cares about what some random nobodies on the internet think of him. He is getting paid to hoop:) Living the dream out there
274,2020-02-02 20:25:35,exub61,"yes but he doesnt hit those ,especially when win is on the line as past has shown us.I still remember 2 years ago (or was it more now lol) when he missed two back to back game winners against Celtics and Spurs..And those game he also had other guys completely open"
275,2020-02-02 20:14:24,exub61,Yep and I meant what I said
276,2020-02-02 20:39:56,exub61,"Yeah maybe we can get him a stretch of rest at some point. It sure would be nice to understand what they are doing with Millsap. I sure hope we are paying him fwd a bit and he'd be open to playing on the mid level exception next year or something so we could field more than 2/3s of our salary cap on any given night.

Edit: I get the value of having him fresh for the playoffs though."

280,2020-02-03 04:42:35,exub61,Yeah it‚Äôs pretty bad. I‚Äôm not about that negative energy.

282,2020-02-02 20:23:27,exub61,"That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm sayin. I feel like watching Gary brick shot after shot deflates the team and results in poor defence afterwards. Malik when he‚Äôs hitting shots is huge for the team, see: bucks game"
283,2020-02-02 21:00:17,exub61,Trade him for picks
284,2020-02-02 21:01:36,exub61,At this point I‚Äôd trade Gary and Juancho for a used napkin
285,2020-02-02 20:17:05,exub61,Do you REALLY though because i have virtually no faith in either
286,2020-02-02 20:25:55,exub61,"Beasley has improved on defense massively, this is such an outdated take."
287,2020-02-02 20:13:58,exub61,Yup
288,2020-02-02 22:05:57,exub61,Yeah I do t know where we get the idea that either of them have any value any more.
289,2020-02-02 21:35:07,exub61,"When we're playing Game 7 of the WCF in LA or SLC, it will be this team's inability to crush massively inferior competition that we'll all look back on."
290,2020-02-03 04:34:14,exub61,Maternity sounds right to me...
291,2020-02-02 20:53:03,exub61,"I dont think that Harris was our biggest problem. Juancho was absolutely getting destroyed on defense, and on offense he wasnt doing anything. So i dont understand way keep him in? Put in JV or TC3 at least they would play some defense."
292,2020-02-02 20:21:43,exub61,love the dedication my man. It‚Äôs still 1 pm in CO.
293,2020-02-02 20:21:44,exub61,I got up at 4:30am to watch it in aus and I really regret it
294,2020-02-02 20:30:06,exub61,"I know it's early there because I watched Djokovic earlier win AO. I know he played in the evening there. 

At least he didn't disappoint, but he put me in such a great mood and then this travesty happens, and I'm dead inside again."
295,2020-02-02 20:55:58,exub61,Yes this would do the trick for me too.
296,2020-02-02 20:17:35,exub61,I love the guy and keep hoping he has a come back game but it's just not happening.
297,2020-02-02 20:27:25,exub61,He had a kid??
298,2020-02-02 20:45:51,exub61,yeah but if you are coach you dont give him 32 minutes then while benching someone like Craig...
299,2020-02-03 04:07:39,exub61,That would be amazing. That would make sense as to why TC wouldn‚Äôt pull the trigger this year. If you know you still have a transition period with Millsap helping Jerami and MPJ take starting roles you‚Äôd just hold onto your players. If Millsap would leave for nothing it would be in our best interest to trade him.
300,2020-02-02 22:22:28,exub61,there's alot of assholes in here today with zero empathy. seriously one of the worst post game threads in a while.
301,2020-02-02 22:59:27,exub61,"They didn't go all in, but they moved their Jamal Murray equivalent in Monta Ellis to kick start their dynasty"
302,2020-02-02 22:53:55,exub61,"I would love Jrue or Beal, we're basically unbeatable on offense when MPJ is on, now imagine adding a top level scorer next to Jokic who can provide that on a consistent basis."
303,2020-02-02 22:51:14,exub61,Beal would be a crazy upgrade
304,2020-02-03 02:40:42,exub61,chris paul is severely overrated at this point in his career
305,2020-02-02 20:26:52,exub61,With the way he played all game there‚Äôs no way he should  have played in OT Beasley or Craig much better options for a game like this
306,2020-02-02 20:27:55,exub61,This subreddit is a shit storm
307,2020-02-02 20:20:53,exub61,He contributed to the loss in a major way Yea. Can't put a loss on 1 guy though.....
308,2020-02-02 22:11:27,exub61,Everyone? MPJ over my dead body
309,2020-02-02 20:23:27,exub61,"Well, the players actually. They don‚Äôt seem too fond of the media not showing them any respect. Even when we were healthy we still dropped these kinds of games to below .500 teams. It‚Äôs not strange if it‚Äôs become a routine."
310,2020-02-02 20:15:50,exub61,"He‚Äôs a Bucks fan, must still be mad about the other night"
311,2020-02-02 20:20:20,exub61,No thanks we have our starting Center
312,2020-02-03 08:19:31,exub61,Lol I love that you tried
313,2020-02-02 21:31:22,exub61,He has been regressing for 2 years. Who knows how much is physical and how much is mental. But he is turning into a weak link.
314,2020-02-02 21:54:16,exub61,"People who think anyone will get traded this week are out of their minds.

Tim is not good at his job. He's a very good scout but he's not a scout. He's a President of Basketball Ops/GM. His job is to make the tough decisions that he has refused to make since he got here. So now Malone will have to figure out a way to balance Harris/Beasley/Craig minutes while also getting MPJ the 20-25 minutes he deserves while also balancing Millsap/Grants minutes while neither of them can play any small ball 5 minutes due to Plumlee...which will limit MPJs minutes because he can't get any time at the 4 and all his minutes will have to come at the 3."

319,2020-02-02 21:29:07,exub61,He's had some great games
320,2020-02-02 20:16:13,exub61,Hope so

These losses are Just way more frustrating than a potential losa against the team with the Best record in the RS"
323,2020-02-02 20:20:15,exub61,Man I do agree with you but last possession of 4th he gets double team on him and goes for a layup with Jokiƒá open with couple of second to go ... I mean come on if he doesn't get fuck you for that idk what should he get it for
324,2020-02-06 04:20:21,exub61,Alright guys.  Spent the last few days listening to all the other local US broadcasts.  Confirmed: yours is the worst.
325,2020-02-02 20:36:00,exub61,Yeah boi I‚Äôll jump right on that
326,2020-02-02 20:33:13,exub61,Lol sightseeing in Detroit that's hilarious
327,2020-02-03 09:50:53,exub61,"But almost everyone injured right now had **known** risk of injury, it's not like it came out of nowhere.

- Gary fell in the draft due to injury, and look, he's been injured for two years straight and literally lost his game because of it. 

- MPJ, no comments needed, it's gonna be a concern hanging over the fanbase every time he lands awkwardly. 

- Millsap was a risk due to his age, and he's missed like a season and a half in the two and a half seasons he's been here. Constantly injured.

- Jury's out on Vanderbilt and Bol Bol. 

Then having those high risk players makes things worse when guys you don't expect to be injured (Murray, Plumlee) go down. And by running Jok into the ground you're unnecessarily increasing the risk of his injury."
328,2020-02-02 21:21:04,exub61,"DIG IN!

I think we will be!!! If we can win 3-4 out of the next 5 we should be good to go.

Clippers have a hard schedule and the Jazz have an impossible on. 

Not worried at all. :)"

334,2020-02-02 21:08:48,exub61,"They should pick up JJ Redick, because they need a shooter which they can rely on game after game. JJ could also be another clutch guy along side Jokic."

339,2020-02-02 20:29:01,exub61,Same. For one quarter I thought I'd made the right choice lol
340,2020-02-02 20:20:28,exub61,I wish he would too. He was so good two years ago but I think injuries have killed his offense
341,2020-02-03 04:25:59,exub61,"I kinda thought the same thing. Like yeah, I would have liked to beat Detroit, but if you said we can put a win on two solid teams, lose to a team that isn't a contender at all I'll take it. Hell if you had told me we would go 2-1 in this 3 game stretch I would have been pleased with it too. I get the talk about consolidation trades, and if the right opportunity comes, I expect our FO will make the right decision, but this sub is so full of overreactions. I am guilty too, but I try not to be."
342,2020-02-02 23:35:15,exub61,You realize Murray‚Äôs numbers at this point through his career are on point with where Beal was at this point in his career. The kid is 22. Damian Lillard was a rookie at 22 and Curry was in his 2nd year and look how they turned out. Murray has been playing since 19. If they are as good as they are imagine what Murray could be at when he‚Äôs 26-27. Give him some time to grow and really mature. He‚Äôs had one year of playoff experience and has pretty good numbers. I know he hasn‚Äôt seemed to make a huge jump this year but it doesn‚Äôt happen like that every season. Beal took steps way farther back than Murray had at the beginning of his career yet he turned out pretty good. He will get there. The kid is a workhorse and having MPJ there now too will open up so much more for him to be better.
343,2020-02-02 23:25:55,exub61,"I'm not sold on either of them. Beal is an awful defender who has quit on his team, and jrue has never been a winner. I feel like trading for all-starish players never works. Look at horford or Harris in Philly, kryie in boston, etc etc. The only time trades work is if you're getting an all-pro or someone with a ton of potential. I'd rather wait a year, then go after KAT, Simmons or Giannis."

350,2020-02-02 21:45:37,exub61,Seriously man? He clearly wasn‚Äôt referring to Gary‚Äôs newborn son as the ‚Äúissue.‚Äù You‚Äôre the only one who made that connection.
351,2020-02-02 21:38:42,exub61,"it's not disgusting - I may have came of insensitive and in that case I apologize. English is not my native language and ""issue"" was the best phrase i could think of to describe complicated personal or family, maybe health related, situation. what other word could I have used? Problem? Serious situation? 

I am happy that he got his son, but his son was born in the last week, while he has been playing badly entire season. Other players get kids and it doesn't affect them like this, unless the child was diagnosed with some serious stuff. And as a person whose brother had to go through some serious stuff when his new born kid was diagnosed with Down's syndrome, i don't want to go any further into that. It seems like tempting faith, insensitive and in general in bad taste"
352,2020-02-03 01:26:35,exub61,"question is, how much money would you bet on him being 100% ever again, because he wasn't good on offense to start the season either"
353,2020-02-03 17:14:06,exub61,"Exactly.  My favorite trade take has always been ....

‚ÄúWe need to consolidate and trade for a Lebrom, PG, Kawhi, Giannis-type wing.‚Äù

Like yeah fuckin obviously everybody needs that guy.  

You don‚Äôt trade for that guy at a random trade deadline.  That guy decides where he wants to play and plays there for 3-5 years.

You draft that guy. 

We are fine, the only trade Denver needs to make is to clear space for MPJ to get consistent minutes.  Trade guys who we are not going to pay.  Trade guys who deserve to play somewhere else or don‚Äôt have the talent to be on a contending team.

Keep competing and building a future.  

I love guys who bring up the Raptors as an example with Kawhi.

They traded for KAWHI LEONARD, because the stars aligned and he wanted out.  They didn‚Äôt trade for Otto Porter or RoCo.  They traded their all-star for a better all/star."

Fact is they're tired and men down and they lost the least important game this weekend. Losses happen. We aren't the 8 loss GSW team. Every season is a journey.

Btw, we're now 50 games into the season. That makes 214 games since Millsap signed. He's played in 140, missed 74. So correction, he's missed a season worth of games in two and a half seasons. Better?"

In other words, I would not call his son, a human being, an issue in any way. but there are cases, situations, whatever you may call it, when childbirth can make a person's life very complex, in a bad way, enough to make you rethink your entire life and make everything else (basketball in this case), totally irelevant. In any case, i sincerely hope everything is ok with Garry and his entire family, especially his newborn son and Garry will soon return to his old self.

391,2020-02-02 08:13:29,exlai1,"ESH They were obnoxious and gross. You could've responded better or walked away. However, they are adults and you are a child so their fault is much higher, imo.

Just so you know, you will be fielding questions like this until you're married (then you'll get questions about having kids) so it's a good idea to come up with a way to handle it that doesn't cause too much strife if you can. For right now you can say you're focusing on school then start talking about school until their eyes glaze over."
392,2020-02-02 09:06:53,exlai1,I think you're 13 and should be talking to your parents.
393,2020-02-02 08:53:36,exlai1,"ESH. Your family were being obnoxious, pushy braggarts, BUT even at your age you could have been a bit more civil, especially as you were celebrating your grandfather's birthday.

Just a heads up, the questioning never really stops. I'm in a 8&1/2 year relationship, engaged, and the questions have just shifted from ""why aren't you dating?"" to ""when are you finally getting married?"" and ""when are you going to start having kids?"" You learn to tolerate it. It's annoying, but it gets better.

 I will say that your perception of yourself might be warped. There are 7 billion people out there, all with their own idea of beauty. Just because you see yourself as unattractive, doesn't mean you're not going to be a 10/10 to someone else. You're also only 13. Puberty is a biatch, and it can make you look out of proportion and awkward because your body is growing at different stages. That doesn't make you unattractive, but you might notice these changes and perceive them as bad. Just remember your peers are going through the same thing, and a lot of them are probably also worrying about their subjective 'ugliness', even if they don't let on."

Obligatory statement of I‚Äôm on mobile, so sorry for any errors. 

I (13 M) was celebrating my grandfather‚Äôs (on my dad‚Äôs side) birthday. My grandpa was talking about how he had his first kiss at 11 and how, ‚Äúhe was the Michael B. Jordan of the 60‚Äôs‚Äù. The whole day was basically him bragging about his relationships and I was starting to get frustrated and wanted to leave.

Then my grandparents asked if I was gay, and I got sick of their BS and said, ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not fucking gay!‚Äù  Then they asked why I didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend yet since they were in ‚Äúserious‚Äùrelationships when they were my age. So I said, ‚ÄúMaybe I got the ugly gene from you two.‚Äù All my family told me and my parents to leave because of what I said.

My parents and a few family members are on my side and think my grandparents were out of line, but a majority of them think I am TA. So Reddit, WIBTA for calling my grandparents out for their BS and their disrespect.

397,2020-02-02 09:08:04,exlai1,NTA. They're being incredibly weird and there's zero reason for a 13 year old to be in a serious relationship. I understand why you snapped but try not to call your grandparents ugly in the future lol

Or plan ahead with your parents for them to interrupt when your grandparents do this.

Or ask them about their health issues or their golf game or whatever it is they like to talk about.

Basically, change the subject every time. If they weren't so obviously unwilling to leave it alone then I'd suggest telling them they're making you uncomfortable but I think that might only egg them on so just keep changing the subject until they get the idea or forever if they never get it."

You look in the mirror and see a 4-5. That‚Äôs normal. You see the flaws. Other people don‚Äôt see every flaw and the vast majority of them aren‚Äôt assigning you a number.

I‚Äôm gonna let you in on something that you will never hear a kid your age admit. Sometimes girls pretend to have crushes because their peers say that they should. Sometimes girls like boys and keep it secret because their peers would disapprove. I wasn‚Äôt interested in *any* boys at 13, but I pretended to be because I thought I was supposed to.

451,2020-02-01 05:40:52,ex04lp,This was sad.
452,2020-02-01 06:42:01,ex04lp,This song....

Really well done and it was genuinely hard to watch but I didnt want to not watch it.

He just seemed so fulfilled when he retired and like he was just ready for the next step of his life. 

Idk man there haven't been many celeb deaths that hit me hard but this one is so damn hard"
455,2020-02-01 14:56:47,ex04lp,Just realized I haven't heard Michael Jordan say anything about Kobe this week.

457,2020-02-01 16:06:10,ex04lp,I don't think I've ever seen more love and pride between any two individuals like this bond between father and daughter
458,2020-02-01 17:25:20,ex04lp,I have cried more this past week than I have these last few years. Rip Mamba
459,2020-02-01 20:51:58,ex04lp,seen many tributes but this one broke me the most...you won't be forgotten kobe...
460,2020-02-01 21:16:59,ex04lp,"I've got to admit, I never before realized that Michael B. Jordan's name is Michael Jordan. That B. actually makes a huge difference. Like for real. I'm not being sarcastic. I just noticed it now with OPs Bulls flair."
461,2020-02-01 03:42:01,ex04lp,I cried so much
462,2020-02-01 03:38:16,ex04lp,Beautiful tribute.
463,2020-02-01 03:50:41,ex04lp,Rest in peace Kobe and Gigi
464,2020-02-01 04:53:10,ex04lp,This shit made me cry again
465,2020-02-01 05:24:01,ex04lp,Honestly...a mediocre tribute video. The Lakers one was 10000x better.
466,2020-02-01 07:23:47,ex04lp,"I think we need a few more Kobe threads, his death hasn‚Äôt got enough attention l."
467,2020-02-01 03:37:28,ex04lp,Forreal. That song always makes me tear up.
468,2020-02-01 03:44:24,ex04lp,It feels like it was made in a lab for how perfect it is
469,2020-02-01 03:57:01,ex04lp,I heard that song on the radio for the first time in YEARS an hour before we first found out that Kobe had died. I changed the station because it made me nervous (thinking about Paul Walker and his accident.) Little did I know...
470,2020-02-01 05:41:31,ex04lp,It's not really just a fast and furious song. They composed it for Paul Walker who also tragically died during the filming of ff7. So it makes sense that it fits in well for loss/sadness.
471,2020-02-01 07:12:02,ex04lp,It's literally about losing a close friend. It's pretty fitting.
472,2020-02-01 05:49:09,ex04lp,There's a youtube vid of pau and kobe from a few years ago with this song and i watched it today. :(((
473,2020-02-01 13:44:17,ex04lp,Whoever wrote the song is going to get paid for life . Going to be one of those songs that never goes away like Mariah Carey Christmas time

484,2020-02-01 23:01:44,ex04lp,I lost it at the Huskies jersey. Seeing it and realizing she will never get to wear it was heartbreaking.
485,2020-02-01 04:30:12,ex04lp,I'm okay seeing pictures of him. Seeing pictures and videos of him with Gianna is killing me.
486,2020-02-01 06:23:41,ex04lp,"Part of my youth died last Sunday. This helped me realize that life is tiny pixels we build over time into a huge picture. You don‚Äôt really see the picture while it‚Äôs being made, but when any part of it is deleted, that‚Äôs when you step back and recognize the photo is less than it was. We struggle to understand how a piece of it can be gone and face a crisis of not knowing how to fill the void, but the photo keeps loading and it gives us many more pixels as we move along."
487,2020-02-01 05:19:16,ex04lp,"Hits me harder each time, I don't even think it processed the first day."

If there was anyone who could put in the work and make it really go mainstream, it was him along with Gigi.

495,2020-02-01 05:09:01,ex04lp,The shot at the very end of him holding a young Gigi in his arms on the court was just fucking terribly beautiful and heartbreaking

As a Suns fan, I spent the better part of 20 years booing him. But for the past week all I can do is feel empty and cry when I see those videos. It's just not fair, man. It's just not fucking fair to lose Kobe."

Edit: They just performed the song live at half time and everything I said is wrong, this song is beautiful. Rip Kobe, Wiz deserves a grammy"
512,2020-02-01 17:49:43,ex04lp,"That's exactly the reason I personally don't like the song tbh. It doesn't seem genuine at all especially for the serious content it's trying to portray and it diminishes the message for me. I'm not some never listen to mainstream music types either, I love a ton of modern pop stuff. But this song just kind of rubs me the wrong way with how blatant its use of modern pop formula/group testing aesthetic is vs actually being a song someone made because they were sad/mourning.

Obviously not going to sit here and tell anyone they're wrong for liking it or feeling sad when they hear it but just thought I would put that out there since you mention how it was made in a lab."

516,2020-02-01 05:43:19,ex04lp,"I have no idea why you got downvoted, you're absolutely correct. This isn't some ""fast and furious"" song. They made it for Paul as a tribute and that's why it can be applied to any form of loss or sadness."
517,2020-02-01 04:06:06,ex04lp,It‚Äôs from the movie soundtrack.
518,2020-02-01 05:56:29,ex04lp,"Can anybody explain these downvotes?

It‚Äôs not just a random song from the fast and furious.. it‚Äôs a song for Paul Walker they put in the fast and furious to honor Paul Walker after he died. 

It was specifically and intentionally written to be an ‚Äúanthem for loss and sadness‚Äù. OP is making it seem like a random song from F&F"

You could always see her eyes light up when she watched him from the sidelines, starting from a very young age. 

He was right indeed when he said he had passed the basketball gene to her.

And by all accounts they had a very special bond, which is visible to all even by watching them in pictures and videos. 

I also read somewhere that, despite how twisted this may sound, that if either of them had to go this way, it would have be together, because life would simply be unbearable if one of them got left behind without the other."

It‚Äôs absolutely senseless and the epitome of the unfairness of life.

The human mind can simply not register what happened and the mass aftershock is this universal response to what lies beyond our comprehension, and the very questioning of the nature of our fleeting existence.

That‚Äôs why, along with Kobe‚Äôs amazing life and touching impact, there‚Äôs not a soul that hasn‚Äôt been affected by the news, whether a basketball fan or not"

I just loved the chase; relished in how fast-paced it was and how much it demanded from me in terms of resilience, thinking on my feet and reading people.

So thinking how good Kobe was in it, I have mad respect for the effort and the commitment that went into it. 

I also remember my classmates who were more heavily into basketball being mesmerized by him and his Black Mamba force.

Since his passing, I‚Äôve had this urge to pick up the ball again but there are no decent adult women‚Äôs teams around my parts. 

Maybe I will pick up tennis again; it appears he loved it, too, for the same reasons I do, which is the fact that you‚Äôre essentially up against your own limits. 


But I‚Äôve been hitting the gym harder though and thinking of his quotes about working harder and pushing through the limitations of pain.

I push! I don‚Äôt back down! And I want to remember that from now on.

My salutes to you my friend.

561,2020-01-31 08:21:22,ewl1s9,"Hey man!

A great place to start is by the fitness wiki, [here](https://thefitness.wiki/). It's a good resource and I would suggest reading all of it.

In my opinion, success in fitness, and in life, is about focusing on habit-building first, and then on hard work second. You might try counting your calories using an app like myfitnesspal, before changing anything you eat, just to get used to doing that. Similarly, I would focus on building up a routine where you go to the gym, go for a walk or jog, or do some form of simple bodyweight exercise 3 days a week - the same days, too, like monday, wednesday, and friday. Once those habits are established, you'll find it easier to throttle the amount of effort your're putting in - reducing your intake of calories (while doing some exercise, including lifting weights) to lose weight, increasing the amount of weight training you do and your intake of calories to gain strength (I would do it in that order if I were you).

Some evidence that I've run into suggests that most muscle-building and adaption happens after puberty in student athletes, so be aware if you try to build strength and find it harder than you expected that your best muscle-building days may be ahead of you.

Overall, I would say: learn and build habits first. If you start trying to lose weight now, it is likely you will see some significant results by august (though you probably won't look like Michael B Jordan).

For sleep, go to a GP."
562,2020-01-31 08:23:00,ewl1s9,"I would try first asking your parents for a fitness membership to Planet Fitness. I think it's a good place to start at, let's you have all those machines that show you the basic movements. 

If they say no, start running. That's free and you can just go outside. You can check out the body weight fitness subreddit as well if you want to build strength. I always used textbooks, heavy rocks from outside, and any other heavy object I could find as weights when I started at 14-15.

You could also try joining a sport club, like ultimate or tennis. I know there must be some clubs.

The hardest part is sticking to a routine. If you are serious, always remind yourself why you are doing this when it gets real hard.

As for the rest of the advice for nutrition, read the side-bar completely. From start to finish. Read about calories and food and CICO. I think it's the nutrition that's the hardest part and you really have to understand it to make it work."

With that added this is a recipe for pure fucking domination."
569,2020-01-31 08:41:38,ewkehn,"Yes yes and yes! 
I've been there myself(31 m), I was a superinsecure teenager, only sitting at home playing games and jacking off late into the night, getting late for school and never thought I would find a girl.

But taking those small steps out of your comfort zone and starting to take care of yourself does wonders in the long run. 

I can't tell my 16 year old self that everything will be ok and I'll meet a beautiful wife and have two amazing kids! 
But I can tell this to you, the young people reading this now. Things will work out. But you do need to keep making changes to get there, to become the best you! 

I am not perfect today, hence why I ended up in this subreddit. But I got my job, wife and kids. My relationship made me a bit lazy, especially having kids which has made me lose the energy to eat healthy and excersize, this is what I'm working on today. This together with nofap I am om the path to becoming the greatest me and the best possible partner to my wife."
570,2020-01-31 07:56:18,ewkehn,"Great post! Been doing some of your tips stated above on post. Especially on the social one üòâ

We‚Äôre also on the same age mate! 


And I also want to encourage the young guns to do this NoFap/NoPMO challenge. Because I know how it feels to be terrible at younger age I missed a lot of opportunities because of this addiction. And I believed that once they have done this challenge properly it will give them a better future and save their future from annihilation. I only discovered no PMO when I was 20(2 years ago) it gave me confidence, made me stronger, wiser, can handle everything through ups and downs, made a very optimistic person as well, met several new friends, and made me MORE PRODUCTIVE. 


And I would also want to suggest that you young guns must consider to read self-help genre books or what ever your choice is, because it can keep tensions and anxiety away when you attain a flow state while reading and gain knowledge in return.

Limit your phone usage as well to avoid your urges to trigger.

Don‚Äôt spend too much time on playing games.


Anyway, thanks for the one who posted this thread.
I hope the young guns could read this post. It‚Äôs very helpful not just for the youngers ones. But for all of fellow fapstronauts.


Have a great day everyone!"

572,2020-01-31 15:34:04,ewkehn,"I really appreciate this post. One thing I dont agree with, however, is the ""if it feels bad dont do it"" mentality. Maybe when you first try putting your life together mentally, physically, and spiritually this is the case. However, seeking discomfort and leaving that comfort bubble in all aspects of ur life will jumpstart your growth in those aspects. 

Working out 3 days a week and don't feel like working out on that 3rd day? Go double as hard. Your brain and body will thank you for it in many surprising ways and your willpower will build incredibly compared to other men stuck in their comfort zone. At the same time, dont go super hard at first without getting your feet into the water. You dont want to burn out right away."

577,2020-01-31 12:46:01,ewkehn,I really like your post and it is very informative. If not anything it's a good goal to Target. My struggles like many others is the consistency. I keep failing. Either due to laziness or external factors which discourage me. When something like break up or fight with a friend happens I get super discouraged. I lose my focus and skip a few and then I lose track. And days becomes weeks and then months. It gets even harder to get back.

581,2020-01-31 19:30:39,ewkehn,"There‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôd like to add and i think it‚Äôs important with all of the other things you mentioned, OP, and that is to STOP BEING DESPERATE! 

Here me out, what do you like to talk about most? Yourself, your accomplishments, your interests, etc. 

What do other people like to talk about? You guessed it, themselves and their interests. 

You‚Äôll realize very quickly the power in silence and being interested in other people. 

Genuine interest. 

Not pretending to care about what a girl/guy is saying so you can hopefully get laid. Put on a smile, remember their name and use it, and listen. Make them feel heard or be able to talk about what they like. 

When you stop seeking attention from girls/guys by talking about yourself, or trying to show how great you are and instead let them do the talking, it‚Äôs amazing how much they like you more. 

Don‚Äôt search for companionship or intimacy. Be yourself, be a good human, and be their friend. 

The pressure and anxiety of social interaction melts away when both parties feel comfortable around each other.  We are wired to sense when someone is being fake, so don‚Äôt try to be fake. 

Follow OP‚Äôs advice and you‚Äôll quickly gain the confidence to begin being around other people. And the more you let them talk and take genuine interest, the more THEY will ask YOU to spend time with them. 

As you get started on your all around self help journey as OP suggests, take an interest in reading non fiction book. You will learn more and have more to talk about. 

Start with the classic How to Win Friends and Influence People and you‚Äôll understand what I mean more. 

Best of luck everyone! 

REMEMBER: don‚Äôt manipulate people for personal gain or sexual gratification. Channel the energy into something else all together. 

TL:DR  Follow OPs advice and read How to Win Friends and Influence People"

585,2020-01-31 17:15:31,ewkehn,Crucial advice. I‚Äôd like to add that if anyone is depressed or extremely anxious don‚Äôt be afraid to try medications as they can really help you move forward.
586,2020-01-31 18:40:58,ewkehn,"The best post I've seen in a while on here, thanks for sharing your view/habits/tips! Personally for me, fixing my diet (I'll include drinking enough water in this), exercising, getting enough sleep and trying your hardest to not say no unless you're absolutely forced to have been the real game changers for me, I'm actually curious to check where I would have been had I not fixed these issues

Also to anyone out there trying to gain confidence and social skills, check out r/seduction ans r/socialskills, or even the serious r/AskReddit posts about these topics, you can pick up a lot of good habits/behaviours from there"

588,2020-01-31 17:17:27,ewkehn,"all great tips. One thing I want to add is that doing all these things isn‚Äôt just about willpower. It‚Äôs more about building habits for yourself, like getting exercise, sleep, and eating healthy. There have been studies that show the brain doesn‚Äôt always do what‚Äôs easiest, just what it‚Äôs used to. So the key to habits isn‚Äôt willpower, it‚Äôs about making habits easier for yourself so your brain just does them instinctively. Same goes for breaking bad habits, it‚Äôs not about willpower, but how hard or easy it is to break that habit. The person who‚Äôs going to succeed at eating healthy is not the one who doesn‚Äôt eat the cake that‚Äôs in the fridge, it‚Äôs the one that doesn‚Äôt have any cake in the fridge in the first place."
589,2020-01-31 19:25:07,ewkehn,"Absolutely all of this. And if anyone in your life mocks you for any this - cut them out. If some one in your life pokes fun at you for improving yourself, trying to eat consciously, exercise, or participate in a new activity that feels good, and is building your confidence. They don't want you to succeed and you have to know when to say adios and open yourself up to the new connections that WILL be offering themselves."

&#x200B;

I think for my part at least the fitness part truly truly is a must, as you can see the constant progress and while some lifestyle changes such as meditation its hard to see a progress straight away so many people fall off it... With the gym just seeing the changes physically but also seeing how you quickly move up the weights. 

I think any new improvement in life its so hard to start as we want instant progress or think ""this isn't for me"".. but trust me build a habit of the gym and hell be as innate as brushing your teeth"

With no intimacy available, and I highly doubt any girls like me anyways, what can I do? As for me, I don‚Äôt have as much trouble fighting porn as masturbation.

629,2020-01-31 18:07:10,ewkehn,"I can attest to this actually. I'm 19, I started to quit when I turned 18. Before I had no plan and would only get 1-day streaks but that was when I ate shit and didn't exercise. Essentially I ran on willpower to get to 90 days. Let's face it, especially in the beginning of quitting, most people do not have will power. Starting college, I decided to go to the gym and exercise. I was getting on streaks of 4-6 days. Although small, for the first time in years, I actually felt happy and better about myself and knew there was no turning back. Fast-forward to summer, I went to work out with one of my best friends in the morning and ate a healthy breakfast. That lead me to get on longer streaks of 5 to 6 days with the occasional 7 which was originally my all-time record. Then, this school year, I got more roommates (total of 6 including me) so my environment changed. I consistently had days of 8+ PMO-free days. My record last semester was barely 14 days. Now this semester, I decided to change my diet even more and even dress better. Last December, for the first time I asked someone out. Got rejected but I'm glad I did it. This semester, I added broccoli to my diet. The last time I relapsed was Sunday a couple hours past midnight prior to my break ending. 12.5 days. This super bowl weekend, I'm going to beat my streak. I also know this since my good roommate is bringing his girlfriend here so it makes it impossible to relapse. Thanks for sharing. I took this advice from someone and it work. I'm glad you reiterated it because we do need this. Cheers."

On the other hand, my life so far has largely been composed of an extremely poor series of decisions and life practices, and yet I've had a good deal of success with women through a mixture of tenacity, looks and wittiness. 

I'm not trying to be a dick, I just wish these guides to success would admit that, yeah, if you aren't pretty or handsome and you aren't just a naturally funny, witty or interesting person (yes, maybe it's time to admit it) you will still inevitably struggle if you don't have realistic standards.  THIS IS NOT ME BRAGGING, I'M GENUINELY ANNOYED BY HOW MISLEADING THESE GUIDES ARE.

664,2020-01-31 12:50:29,ewkehn,"Mee too, although he doesn't explain how to get intimacy, he only says it will come.. 

I workout every day , sleep 8 hours a day, do meditation, yoga, salsa classes, go out Fridays and Saturdays to bars and clubs, I have friends, I am studying computer science, I read books and doing a internship right now

Also.. I never had a girlfriend and sex, it has been two years now on nofap, had lots of platonic dates and no success, although I'm happy and proud of myself

Just saying, I know people who never worked in there life watching Netflix and drinking beer who got more intimacy than me, you just got to be lucky enough with intimacy to find or meet the right girl"

672,2020-02-01 05:27:38,ewkehn,"Awesome. I'm 29, and am trying to fix up my life socially. I've never had a girlfriend, and I struggle with getting out there. I've spent too much time in isolation, and am finding it hard to try anything.

I know I need to stop waiting for the moment I feel 100% confident, pick something that will help me socialize more (hobby, sport, etc.), and just try it. I just feel paralyzed by anxiety about doing those things alone though."
673,2020-01-31 18:56:58,ewkehn,"Hey grandpa, this post is for younger guys only"
674,2020-02-01 02:18:54,ewkehn,"I'm 15 and I'm glad that I found these posts so early in life, I can now work on improving as a person."
675,2020-01-31 18:01:41,ewkehn,"A golden rule someone told me that helps is: when you start feeling terrible and you‚Äôre craving something, honestly, JUST EAT IT. You can have it. But, you have to do these two things.

1 - there‚Äôs no excuse these days for not having anything around to satisfy sweet cravings. Seriously, there‚Äôs zero calorie sodas, and most gas stations (in the US) offer bananas. Seriously, a banana travelled thousands of miles and is available to you when you‚Äôre filling your tank. What a time to be alive. If you don‚Äôt know what to look for, there‚Äôs so many subreddits for people with this issue (diabetics, weight loss etc)

2 - buy single use plastic water bottles from the grocery in bulk. Keep them in your car, desk or at work. chug a plastic bottle of water and only when you finish it, you can have whatever it is you‚Äôre craving. Then you have to drink another plastic bottle after you‚Äôre done. It HAS TO BE PLASTIC BOTTLES AND YOU HAVE TO CHUG THEM, not just sip and forget. Pretty soon you‚Äôll get tired of buying these things from the grocery store and having them clog up your car/desk. You‚Äôll also feel guilt over all the plastic. This in particular worked for me. You start to see an actual impact (cost, environmental) of your actions. It actually rewires your sense of control, reward system, everything. It will work if you let it

Also, with the gym, unless you are dangerously obese, eat at or above maintenance for a while while you establish your gym routine. Seriously, you can eat stuff like lasagne, sandwiches, milk, chips. Only when you are able to accomplish your gym routine for 3 weeks in a row, focus on your diet. You‚Äôll spin your wheels if you‚Äôre running on empty. Your body will try to defend itself and make you cranky bc it has no meat, fiber, water, sleep to repair itself."
676,2020-01-31 18:16:34,ewkehn,"Totally agree. Here‚Äôs an example of what I meant more specifically.

If you‚Äôre a young person who gets overwhelmed by noise, don‚Äôt force yourself to go to a dark, loud event like a concert and be extremely uncomfortable. Make some kind of effort that makes you a little nervous, but you can think ‚Äúokay yeah, I can do this‚Äù. Yes change takes effort and tenacity. But it should never be painful or overwhelming."
677,2020-01-31 23:48:30,ewkehn,"this is true, the main thing about building habits is not about doing them on the good days, anyone can do that. it is about doing them on the days where you absolutely don't feel like doing it. This is how you build good habits that last a lifetime and face discomfort head on."
678,2020-01-31 18:32:00,ewkehn,This is valid. I am able to control myself better with it and stay focused while also avoiding real sugar. It is absolutely a drug.
679,2020-01-31 19:55:38,ewkehn,True but sometimes it‚Äôs tough to wake up brotha and a little cup of coffee can help
680,2020-02-01 08:37:16,ewkehn,Me personally i don't drink coffee cause it just hides the fact that i need to get better sleep then i wouldn't be tired.

687,2020-02-05 03:38:35,ewkehn,"Yeah buddy, go for it. If not, just remember this.

First step for you. Find people who embody what you wanna be. Might be your dad, or older brother....might be Marshawn Lynch. Pay attention to their accomplishments, how they act, their physique. If you don't have someone in mind, do a google search for athletes/actors/youtubers with your similar height, age, weight. FIND OUT WHAT THEY EAT, HOW THEY SLEEP, THEIR FITNESS REGIME, HOW THEY USE THEIR FREE TIME. COMPARE THIS TO WHAT YOU DO AND FIX IT. (Also  just remember people are genetically different, if you're 6'7"", 100 pounds and korean nothing you can do will make you look like Michael B. Jordan. Gotta find similar role models lol).

If nothin else check out the sidebar over at r/progresspics. You can look up your height and gender and find people before/after they changed their lives for better. They will tell you how they did it and you know it works. I say this because how much fat someone has is a good indicator of how healthy their hormone levels are. You don't see many obese or frail dudes beaming with confidence. Because.. you guessed it. Their hormones are out of whack.

Find men you respect and want to embody. Find out what they do. Chances are, they probably get up early, drink coffee/tea/water, and have places to be. They don't stay inside and watch porn. They probably get up and hit the gym, study hard, or grind at their job. Then go spend time with their friends/SO's, doing healthy activities. Then they go to sleep, exhausted. They probably don't have much free time. Ask them and you'll find out."
688,2020-02-05 03:45:14,ewkehn,"Such a great movie, underrated for sure"
689,2020-02-05 03:47:17,ewkehn,"I agree, men are in decline. Be the change you wanna see my man."

691,2020-01-31 19:23:02,ewkehn,"The 80/20 on that area is

1. Be attractive
2. Don't be unattractive"
692,2020-01-31 13:46:35,ewkehn,"I wish I could provide advice for this particular situation, man. Don‚Äôt get discouraged. Reddit has so many people I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone who has experience in this."
693,2020-01-31 18:36:13,ewkehn,"Totally understand, and I should have mentioned my advice comes from personal bias, this will not fit everyone‚Äôs life. All I know is going to events helps you meet people, which in turn exposes you to personal growth and experience."
694,2020-01-31 19:01:18,ewkehn,"I have this same problem. If you understand the underlying reason why you‚Äôre uncomfortable with eye contact, you will be able to fix it.

I‚Äôm not an expert but I am 99% confident in saying that avoidance of eye contact is being submissive and not sure of yourself. Looking into someone‚Äôs eyes is actually not painful at all if you are not threatened by them in some way. Normally men have this problem with women or superiors at work. 

Address why you are feeling low on self esteem or anxious. Then, practice with a friend, they might laugh but I‚Äôd bet true friends would help you role play. If no friends, then practice cashiers, or random people. Nothing to lose, they‚Äôll never see you again. Hope this helps."
695,2020-01-31 18:56:17,ewkehn,"If you get a grip on mental/physical health before you settle and establish a life as an adult, you will be way ahead of the game. Once you settle down and get out of school, your habits will be much harder to break. 

That was my intent."
696,2020-02-01 04:00:09,ewkehn,"I don't follow. I am suggesting a good, healthy life first. Then everything else after. Refer to the layout of my post. It is foolish to think a guy has to abandon health to have good ""game"". I know plenty of guys who are healthy, and who know how to hit on women and engage with fun casual relationships."
697,2020-01-31 18:44:02,ewkehn,"Some people can watch porn and go back to work as an engineer and CEO. There‚Äôs no shame at all, it‚Äôs their choice. I love the freedom of the internet, hell yeah, make as much porn as you want. 

Where I am coming from, is that there are a lot of young men on the internet who isolate themselves and are actually addicted to masturbating to porn that they feel shameful about. It actually interrupts life and keeps them from enjoying sports, or parties, normal experiences for people.

I am offering advice that really all people could benefit from. But it is addressed to NoFap because this particular addiction dramatically affects your hormones and reward system. People trying to break this habit will only relapse if they are frail, unhealthy and isolated. I guarantee there are men on here who do not keep their hygiene up or shave scraggly facial hair and wonder why people don‚Äôt want to be very close to them. 

If you want to help change something you have to better understand WHY people are doing it; not focus on the problem itself.

Upvoting you because I hope you learn something and it‚Äôs good to question"
698,2020-01-31 16:15:00,ewkehn,Why are you here then? To spread hate?
699,2020-02-01 00:46:12,ewkehn,"There is a link between these stuff when you're addicted to porn. Low use of porn may not be related, but when you're addicted it leaks into all aspects of your life."
700,2020-02-01 00:33:25,ewkehn,"The guide is about the things you can change. Having a nice haircut, being athletic, smelling better etc will INCREASE how attractive you are. Increase is the key word because its giving tips for improvement, not some gold standard or perfection. At the end of the day attractiveness is subjective, and its better to try and improve what you can rather than give up/accept that you're ugly."
701,2020-01-31 17:21:58,ewkehn,"all of these are backed by facts. There are so many studies done that eating healthy, getting good sleep, and exercising can improve your mental and physical health. Not only that, we know that humans are a social species and we need social interaction to thrive, so again that point is backed by evidence."

704,2020-01-31 16:22:23,ewkehn,"Platonic dates can lead to friendships. Often, your platonic friends will WANT to set you up with their friends, who may not be the hottie you think you desire, but may have other, more important attributes to offer, like intelligence and a good sense of humor, attributes that wear better over time than fading hotness"
705,2020-01-31 19:29:52,ewkehn,"To get intimacy, just talk to girls and if you like them, and you see they like you, ask them out. Sure you might get rejections, but that‚Äôs part of dating. That‚Äôs why slobs who only watch Netflix and drink beer can get girls. Cause they aren‚Äôt afraid to ask them out"
706,2020-01-31 16:25:30,ewkehn,"You know whats funny? That once you do find a lovely girl and you do have sex, the next day you understand that it doesnt fullfill you. Im 20yo, finally managed to quit porn for good after 3 years of trying ( im \~3months in on my streak, my life changed 180 degress in these 3 months ) Ive had sex for the first time a week ago, with a smoking hot girl, it was amazing in the moment, tho I didnt cum because of SR benefits. Anyway, the next day I felt nothing, I wanted to lose my V so hard in the past 2 years and when I finally did nothing changed. I even got depressed a little, because when you really think about it, everything men do in society is to attract the best possible female, and when you get it, you understand that it doesnt fullfill you at all. Ive come to conclusion, that chasing sex and woman is so empty and blank, we should chase perfection and self improvement, women and sex is just a little bonus. The only way to feel fullfilment is thru producing meaningful work."
707,2020-01-31 22:04:06,ewkehn,"I‚Äôve explained this in my past posts and it‚Äôs something people don‚Äôt tell you. It‚Äôs 2 words. 

TAKE RISKS. 

Ask that girl out now and take the risk. Girls don‚Äôt go to you just because you lift."

709,2020-02-01 01:39:47,ewkehn,It sounds like you aren't doing your dates right and getting friendzoned over and over again. Reference r/seduction or r/asktrp if you want to improve your interactions with women.
710,2020-02-01 02:58:13,ewkehn,"you can be a really attractive guy with a good job and friends and still never get laid (even in LTR) if you do not know how to escalate a conversation/ read body language.

Being a desperate, sheepish guy means women view you like a bush. They're not laughing at you, nor are they secretly thinking ""aw what a sensitive sweet guy."". They aren't thinking about you at all. Because you cannot provide value to their life."

OH my god this is so true. There's so many guys out there who watch porn all the time and have girls come at their home whenever they want. Some of them are violent. Some of them lack self confidence. Some of them are disrespectful. And yet I know really awesome men out there who never kissed a girl, just because they're unattractive or short.

For some people relationships just work. But for the others, it's a long and tedious journey, with lots of efforts, saddness, and compromises.

But it can work. I've seen tiny or unattractive men with awesome women. And I believe NoFap is a good start. But... It's just a start."

713,2020-02-01 04:07:06,ewkehn,"Maybe you need to work on your approach at the clubs? Maybe try adding jewelry such as ear rings, finger rings, watches, chains etc. From my experience club girls like that stuff. Also try wearing revealing clothing  such as tight shirts to show off the muscles. You could also try changing how to approach girls at the club. Like every club run try a approach you‚Äôve never done before."

716,2020-01-31 18:28:07,ewkehn,"yes, definitely.
basically when anything becomes harmful the best thing to do is quit.
I mean, anything that can make you addicted.
Dude I hope I still make sense.
Like if gaming becomes an issue and you can't help but game 4 hours every day or if you need to smoke every other hour and it's hurting your finances, from what I've researched and personal experience I'd say the best thing to do is quit the thing altogether.
Though your mileage may vary.
What do you think?"

727,2020-01-31 18:39:08,ewkehn,"I totally understand, if you're only looking for hot females and nothing else you could have empty unfulfilled relationships because they have nothing else to offer than their body

However I have met lots of hot females who also happen to have been very kind, friendly, intelligent and have a passion for something, but it was just not their moment, timing, demographics etc you name it

I don't blame myself for it, I'm just myself and would love to have somebody who will accept me for just being myself, I just haven't found her yet"
728,2020-01-31 19:48:29,ewkehn,"That's great advice, that shows vulnerability which a lot of girls like

I have had lots of dates in the past two years, mostly platonic or one way communication dates, so I'm not actively dating anymore, I just sort of accepted the lack of intimacy and I'm happy by myself, I was just clarifying the fact that even if you have everything you want or the person you want to be, you can't magically get intimacy

The guy just tend to have girls who like a beer and netflix as well, I think intimacy is just the combination of similarities, passions and a bit of luck, maybe I'm just complicated, maybe I'm just too much, ohh well"

730,2020-01-31 19:16:16,ewkehn,"Yes sex isn't the only goal there is in life, and the V card is just symbolic, nobody really cares about our sex life, maybe the guys in highschool who have had nothing better to do

And no, I believe sex could be amazing and fulfilled too, if you have set the basics right, get a girlfriend or someone who you can trust and build upon, who totally believes and supports you, if you just care about each other I believe sex will be a lot better

I just wanted to clearify that I didn't have succes with intimacy when doing nofap, and the poster didn't really explain intimacy, although I do have my desires for love and sex from time to time, I think it's unhealthy to completely block it from your life because it's only a little bonus"

This time it was more of a spiritual thing for me, at some point I just really let myself go and my dark side came out, I tied her hands, I choked her hard, I penetreted as hard as I could with all my might, I fingered the living hell out of her (she is into that type of thing), I cought myself looking at her with those killer eyes, I was the killer and she was my pray, I liked it, not gonna lie. I gave her numerous orgasms and by the morning she was so sensitive I couldnt even kiss or touch her anymore. She fell asleep. I sat on the bed and looked at her, damn, shes is so beautiful.. Took a cold shower, meditated for a bit, then realized one thing, I dont feel any negative emotions anymore, no anger, no frustration or anxiety, just pure bliss and happynes. Ive realized that I used all those dark emotions as fuel to give her the best orgasm I possibly could. I feel different right now, thats for sure, I feel reformed, I feel calm and focused, ready to get back on my grind."

On the other hand buff dudes stand out. Women will absolutely notice them, consider them as option and this gives an illusion that they are more attractive. Or mabe they are more attractive because they are more noticable? Who knows.

But what I am trying to say is that when a woman is already dating a guy, or she is interested in a guy she wants THAT GUY who she is already in love with to have a slimmer type body.

TL;DR - Being buff will give men advantage no matter what women say, but it doesn't mean women prefer this kind of look."

A ""Swimmer type body"" is of a guy who has been doing an average gym routine for years, maybe decades without fail.

The extremes of bodybuiding are just that, extremes, of people who literally build their bodies by daily hours at the gym for years and many, many steroids, more than any normal person would be willing to do.

A swimmer type body is the extreme of the extreme a man who is not working in a physically demanding job will at best get. Or in other words, it is the culmination of doing 2hs per day in the gym without fail for the last decade or so. Which although attainable, is a extreme to the working man.

[Here is a winner in 'natural bodybuilding' contest, as an example.](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/images/2008/beginner_natural_bodybuilder_guide_a.jpg)

[but the swimmer type body is already a extreme.](https://swimmerpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/USA-Relay-Resized-and-Compressed.jpg) But this one to the working man.

Well defined without it being too much seems to be the most ""fit"" or dunno how to put it, but it's not my beauty ideal for what I like, sexy nonetheless, but Cavil is already a bit too much for me, on my personal ""eeriness/alienation/fitness/unfitness/ perception.

What I sometimes really really like is what you see in strongmen, where they have all the muscles but also have a lot of fat and curves, similar to a dad bod just a lot more bear like, but that's all generally a good deal outside my interest so it's only few cases that really appeal where it all just fits together."

Men who don't think this way are annoyed or frustrated with it, even if I didn't care what they eat. It's a day to day irritant that gets old long term since people eat multiple times a day and it's a very couple thing to do. Being with someone who is aligned with how I think of food and cook and eat is something that makes life easier.

It's a like attracts like thing more than 'build a bro' perfection seeking. I totally believe women who say their preference is something else because those are likely driven by their own criteria of things they care about."

3. Funny guy's gotta be funny
4. Kind/comfortable. Woman want to feel comfortable around men
5. Nice hair
6. Well dressed. Ditch the worn out graphic tee and the worn over sized jeans.
7. Lean with some muscle but not too much. Go over the line and you become either physically gross or narcissistic."
783,2020-01-31 16:41:51,ew8vct,"Men project onto women how important bodies are. Because for men, a woman's body is extremely important. For many guys it is just as important as a girls face. As since most guys are not choosy about a girl's height, or style, or friends, or hell even how social they are... body matters a lot. So men think body is just as important to women, hence part of the reason some guys put so much time into the gym.

Many men by nature also find going to the gym and lifting a much easier task than working on a more social persona, going to more interesting events, making more interesting friends, upping their dress style.

Men's attributes to attract women in order of importance:

1. Face
2. Healthy, clear, radiant skin (no ashy, deathly pale, severe acne, veins - anything that looks sickly)
3. Height
4. A social charming persona
5. Style
6. Fun friends and social events girls can join with them
7. Buffness

What getting buff does for a man usually means he can date women with better bodies that respect and like fitness that are still in same facial attractive range as he could before. He may get a bump in women in women eyeing him, especially ones that are not as attractive as him.

Women with clearly more attractive faces that are used to dating men with more attractive faces are not affected too much from a guy less facially attractive than her going from a normal build to buff, especially with clothes on which is 99% of the time you social with people before dating them."

""I don't like women with makeup, I prefer women without makeup"" means ""I prefer a woman who isn't OBVIOUSLY made up"".

""I like a guy who's naturally buff, not too muscly, not one of those weird gym guys who eats weird and is at the gym all the time. Just a guy who was born perfect."" Riiiiight.

I think each gender should spend a month in the shoes of the other. We'd work things out a lot faster."

Those guys are only considered sex symbols *by other guys.* 

&#x200B;

>In conclusion: **women DO prefer slim and lean, but it may seem like they prefer jacked men because as soon as the guys that they already like put on a bit of muscle everyone acts as if they got huge**.

Women are not attracted to men's bodies the way that men are attracted to women's bodies.

But at the same time all the guys you mentioned, are pretty fucking buff and their form is achievable only with extreme discipline and a lot of free time. Even Brad Pitt's fight club figure, being smaller than everyone you mentioned, is still not that easy to get.

So yeah, women like fit men, but fit is enough. Women don't like gym obsessed dudebros, who put set alarms in the middle of the night to drink some protein. In fact, as long as the dude isn't fat, skinny fat or stick skinny, his body can be pretty attractive. Slim, slightly muscular body is pretty good on it's own."

World records in strength sports went **off the fucking rails** in the late 1940s and early 1950s as a result of the first steroids, substances artificially derived from testosterone. The bench press world record went from 160 kg/360 lbs to 230 kg/500 lbs in only three years, and it was a single guy that did that. Today it's 340 kg/750 lbs.

Back in the 1940s no one was steroid-jacked. Today, being bodybuilder-level buffed passes as ""fit physique""."

There is a subset of women who do like giant dudes just like there is a subset who actually prefer the dad bod. So if you want to make yourself more attractive to the majority of women getting fit and in shape will boost your chances. Lifting weights will help too but if you go too far with the muscles it can actually work against you.

Also just because a guy has jacked muscles doesn‚Äôt mean he will do a better job at protecting a women. Just look at the bodies MMA fighters have. They are in super good shape and have some muscle but they aren‚Äôt super jacked because if they were they wouldn‚Äôt be able to move fast enough to kick someone‚Äôs ass.

What I am saying is very specific, guys that are a normal build (not twig skinny, or a fatass) get buff, I wouldn't bank on that to get hotter girls facewise... body wise yes.

Getting hotter girls facewise you are better off having more social confidence, better social life, and better style with a normal build, rather than going ""monk mode"" and concentrating on gainz over everything. Gainz are much less important than the first things I mentioned.

In fact some noob gainz helps those noobs finally have the confidence to work on their social life more, but it is just one path to more social confidence. The best way to gain social confidence is to socialize with other people that are great at socializing and are in circles with hot women."

Both guys are unattractive, but for different reasons. The Pussy might still be considered somewhat attractive if he only loses a couple of fights. But if he loses many times and gets humiliated on the ground, it's over for him."
926,2020-01-31 00:23:12,ew8vct,Women don't care about this at all. They treat men like trophies more than they'd like to admit and a tall guy is an easy trophy to show off. If he gets his ass beat you can bet that she's going to try and restore her trophy so it can be put back on display.

And even today...I will always be 6-2, I have a pretty attractive face but the difference between attention when I am fit and chubby is otherworldly....I travel a good deal for work, eat at restaurants bars to avoid taking up a table so one easy way to notice the difference in getting ignored at the bar when chubby to having female bartenders asking my name, spending all their free time between serving others, chatting and become fast ""friends"", etc."

The woman who you are citing in your linked photos are definitely dieting down, avoiding sodium, and probably temporarily cutting water weight(dehydrating themselves) to temporarily achieve that look for a photoshoot or maybe to shoot for a fetish porn site and almost certainly aren't looking like that year around and they are also probably using diuretics to help shed bodyfat and water weight."

If I were a woman, yeah. Given that working out has helped me and many other men in the past, reality simply doesn't agree with you here.

Now if, all this time, you're talking about roided out men versus moderately fit men, yeah roided out men are probably gross to women. But a simple six pack will get you ten times further than not having one."

1015,2020-01-31 22:58:50,ew8vct,Exactly! Women don't like the dick. The fact that the dick is attached to a muscular guy does not make the dick more appealing.

I feel like Chris hemsworth could fit in this cast but not Tamlin bc I would have to ship Tamlin and Feyre then Haha. I could see Mila kunis or emelia Clarke as Amren! I have such a hard time picking Rhysand/Azriel/cass but Ian somarholder comes to mind some what...kj appa for Lucien! I‚Äôm going down a gossip girl hole now but what about chace Crawford for Tamlin...or leighton meister for Elaine??
1027,2020-06-10 01:55:08,ew3u3g,"This is the best fancast I‚Äôve seen, I‚Äôm obsessed with Chris wood"
1028,2020-01-30 20:16:35,ew3u3g,"Oh shoot, I knew I forgot to edit one. He looks like the perfect Tamlin in our opinion, especially in the Witcher."
1029,2020-01-30 19:17:10,ew3u3g,"Me too, it made me smile."
1030,2020-04-01 21:29:15,ew3u3g,"I know this is an old post but I just discovered this sub. For years, I‚Äôve tried to cast my perfect Rhys and can never pick someone. Just this week, I was introduced to David Giuntoli and he‚Äôs the first man that I‚Äôve thought, yup, that‚Äôs my Rhys. I was really excited to see him on your list."
1031,2020-01-30 23:05:03,ew3u3g,His look in The Witcher makes me think of Rowan Whitethorn.
1032,2020-04-01 23:22:34,ew3u3g,I‚Äôve always loved guys with dark hair. Gorgeous eyes like that adds to it and is rarer. I first saw him on Grimm. Plus his face etc. is just very attractive as well and I liked his character.
1033,2020-04-02 04:18:00,ew3u3g,Also I think the closest for me is fan art like Charli Bowater‚Äôs etc.
1034,2020-01-30 23:11:02,ew3u3g,"Oh man, thats possible too. Though I picture Rowan as a bit more... lean"
1035,2020-04-02 14:37:24,ew3u3g,"I agree, dark hair and light eyes is my favorite combination. I‚Äôll have to check out Charli Bowater‚Äôs art. Thanks for the suggestion!"
1036,2020-01-30 23:11:34,ew3u3g,Definitely agree. Henry Cahill is so pretty but I never pictured Rowan quite that bulky.
1037,2020-01-29 15:48:32,evciyr,"Appreciate all the work you put into this sub, it's one of my favorites on Reddit.

1042,2020-01-28 06:47:43,euyapn,"MBJ is too solidified as synonymous with his other comicbook villain role. It would make more sense to do fan-casts with Idris Elba (he says ""I'm black Superman"" in Hobbs & Shaw trailer) or Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (for obvious reasons) instead. Is MBJ trying to become the new Will Smith and reaching his level of saturation?"
1043,2020-01-28 06:52:37,euyapn,This is perfect
1044,2020-01-28 06:52:13,euyapn,I think Idris is just as famous at least from what I gather. Just curious what would be the issue for a very recognizable actor?
1045,2020-01-28 10:05:13,euyapn,"How about neither of those as well ? Yahya literally had 2 Dc roles in a span of 10 months and Idris was in the mcu and now he's in the Suicide Squad and Jordan was in the Mcu ,fresh choices are always better"
1046,2020-01-28 07:07:39,euyapn,"I just remembered Idris Elba is Heimdall in Thor so my point doesn't stand well, and Yahya is in Watchmen and getting bigger and more recognizable.

Let me amend my argument. I can't see MBJ pulling off Superman because he's good at playing cocky/arrogant type anti-hero characters (like Human Torch and Killmonger aka Golden Jaguar), nothing against him personally, but I dunno if he can pull off humble as someone like Chadwick Boseman can."
1047,2020-01-28 14:25:39,euyapn,"I agree, fresh choice is better, but if people are gonna do fan-casts, I'd rather people branch out and be more imaginative instead of picking MBJ for every role."

Stay at home then. No noises that way.

>2. People leave it everywhere and it creates a mess.

You are not going to clean it and the cleaners are paid for a reason.

>3. They always give you way too much.

Don't eat the excess. Simple."
1057,2020-01-26 00:37:53,etzcu1,Movies are way too loud for you to be complaining about chewing...
1058,2020-01-26 03:42:16,etzcu1,"This doesn‚Äôt work for two reasons:

Firstly, movie theatres / cinemas get *most* of their revenue from concession stand sales like snacks and popcorn.
Popcorn has an incredible profit margin - it can go up to a 1275% markup! Therefore it‚Äôs unlikely
that a movie theatre would stop selling it.


Secondly, people like eating it. People who chew too loudly are just part of the movie experience; it‚Äôs not popcorn‚Äôs fault. This goes for everything else like leaving it on the floor. Assholes exist and popcorn is just a good representation of that."
1059,2020-01-26 06:02:57,etzcu1,"They can't, and they would never. 

Most of a movie theatre's revenue comes from popcorn and other foods/drinks it sells, since only a fraction of ticket sales prices actually go towards the theatre itself.

Popcorn has also been a staple in movie theatres longer than anyone on this site has been alive and nobody will change that any time soon.

Also, as for the chewing with your mouth open part, I get that, but if they took out popcorn they would still do that with other foods too."
1060,2020-01-26 00:55:51,etzcu1,"As long as it's profitable for them, they don't care."
1061,2020-01-26 01:28:37,etzcu1,"I agree, also OP can just get a smaller bucket of popcorn"
1062,2020-01-26 00:49:14,etzcu1,You really are an asshole aren't you?
1063,2020-01-26 00:51:44,etzcu1,I don't see what is so rude in what I said. I proposed simple solutions.

Me: hey dad, wouldn‚Äôt it be easier to do this?

Dad: stop being a disrespectful little shit."
1065,2020-01-22 21:29:21,eshnx4,"the female body you posted has a perfect WHR that you cannot exercise or diet yourself into if your frame isnt built that way.  in fact this has always been my pet theory of anorexia, women trying to starve their way into a better WHR because they dont understand why their bodies look malformed to them"
1066,2020-01-22 20:51:17,eshnx4,"The problem here is a matter of perspective. 

Roids are a bit like plastic surgery (except you have to still have to continually workout to see the benefit). 

The issue is that most people can look at a pair of tits and tell if they are fake or not immediately.  Sure, most people also don‚Äôt care but that‚Äôs not the point. 

Most people can‚Äôt look at someone and tell if they are on roids or not. So guys like Hugh Jackman, Efron, Bale, Cavill, etc. can all dope up like crazy but don‚Äôt get the ‚Äúroids‚Äù stereotype because there are even further outliers like the Rock or even professional bodybuilders. 

It‚Äôs like assuming that anyone with less than FFF bra size must have all natural tits. It‚Äôs just not true. 

Go back and look at old bodybuilders before the steroid era. They look nothing like the actors I mentioned. And people can talk all they want about nutrition improvements, training improvements, etc but none of that obviates the fact that roids are rampantly abused in media for men to a degree that the common populace just isn‚Äôt aware. 

So I am not going to say that the standards are tougher. I think they are different. Both genders have challenges and opportunities that the other does not."
1067,2020-01-22 20:56:05,eshnx4,"* men will fuck anything reasonably thin, female shaped, and young

* men have much higher standards when it comes to signs of aging, which are more difficult to control

* muscle beefs are entirely the creation of the male gaze upon themselves, women merely responded to the overton window.

* at no point have women ever demanded muscle beefs, healthy musculature on a masculine frame were/are the standard.

* the difficult and improbable standard for women is to remain youthful; the solutions are surgical enhancements, arguably more strenuous actions than choosing to adhere to the male gaze that women never demanded in the first place."
1068,2020-01-22 20:45:08,eshnx4,"When was the last time you waxed your taint?

Yes, this is my dead horse and I will beat it like a rented red-headed step mule."
1069,2020-01-22 22:59:04,eshnx4,"Not in today's world.....   

Women basically just do not have to waffle down a Double cheeseburger at breakfast, lunch and dinner AND there will be a sizable extremely large segment of men that like the attributes she process and will give the girl a chance.  Men are negotiable about small boobs, large boobs, thick ass, skinny ass and so and so.  It really is amazing sometimes that during workouts, you will be in the workout areas and it is so easy to see that there are basically two groups of women.....the girls who did in fact let themselves do, realize it and are now are on a mission to lose the 50lbs and belly rolls (good for them) but the other significant portion are the gym bunnies, represented by basically thin\average thick girls who ""workout"" but basically you can't tell the difference between the shapely asses of the girls there every night and those of the new hottie that just joined....as long as they aren't obese then the perfect female form is what nearly every average healthy female processes simply by eating in a healthy way.   

Men, of today are at a disadvantage because the body to which women are attracted falls in a pretty small range...tall, fit muscular or broad shoulder, facial genetics, etc.....AND THE BIGGEST HURDLE is that men's labor and work NO LONGER PRODUCE those bodies as a course of living life.....so men have to put in tons of EXTRA effort in sports, gym, trail, or pool to build those bodies.  And from above...it takes some pretty hard work to redesign a male body more toward what is considered attractive...obviously some are more naturally dispossessed to having that build...I have been on that lucky genetic side with a small negative mark for genetically skinner legs which have to be worked endlessly.   

The reality which is alien to PPD women is that from a body standpoint, WOMEN who are not fat asses start out as a YES then persohality their way out of a fuck\relationship.   Men largely start off as NO then MAYBE and for a small segment of men a YES then have to bring 30 extra attributes to the table in order to pass...even the YES men then have to do the only thing that a decent looking female has to do with is not personality themselves out of a fuck\relationship...so few women are able to do this which says a ton about women.  And also explains why so many of the resident PPD women always come up with the ""reason"" that these guys are not getting dates\fucks is because of their personality\interest\boring BECAUSE THAT IS WHY THEY HAVE MISSED OUT ON RELATIONSHIPS IN THE PAST...their inability not to fuck it with their behavior\personality.  

They simply can't fathom that for most of these guys that they chastise ther for losing out by having terrible personalities, the guys NEVER EVEN GET TO THE POINT WHERE the girl would have any inkling what that humor, charm, interest, and the rest was...they were a NO from the beginning.   

Men are much more willing to give any random woman a shot....physically that is."
1070,2020-01-22 20:37:00,eshnx4,Yes because female plastic surgery is more common. Female eating disorders are more common. Women spend more money on their appearance. And women in general feel worse about their bodies and looks than men do. This all suggests that there are greater pressures for women to conform to a certain standard.
1071,2020-01-22 20:55:12,eshnx4,"The ideal 'female body' isn't achievable unless you have the right genetics or get surgery.

You cant 'improve' your tit size. You cant 'improve' your waist to hip ratio. You can't 'improve' the length of your legs and you can't give yourself a big bubble butt whilst still retaining an athletic stomach like niki minaj/ Kim K

Your male example does look kinda weird and a bit fake - but if any man gets really fit - he can attain a body that a majority of the female population finds attractive. I think the only real issue with men is their height - which I do feel sorry for them for."
1072,2020-01-22 20:34:19,eshnx4,"Women are not asking men to do roids. It's men who encourage each other. *""But Gimp Girl how can that be?""*

\- roids cost money.

\- roids can affect your fertility/health.

\- roids are illegal in most places.

\- roided bodies don't look nice.

if you want to have a family with a guy, those are not good things.

IMO there are no real body standards for men, cuz for women other things are much more important."
1073,2020-01-22 20:36:36,eshnx4,"I believe the average woman is expected to look better than the average man yes.  There is no ‚Äúmom bod‚Äù for women, no silver fox equivalent for women, etc. 

That being said the average women has a much higher threshold for what she finds attractive in a man than what a man does for a woman. So I‚Äôd say it evens out"
1074,2020-01-22 23:12:36,eshnx4,"I think if you consult the Brofessor, he consistently explains that getting huge has nothing to do with attracting women, and everything to do with impressing other men that lift."
1075,2020-01-23 08:15:40,eshnx4,"The dude in your example could be natural with good genetics.

A lot of female fitness models are both on PEDs and have had plastic surgery (implants to replace the fat they lost in their breasts and ass)."

1077,2020-01-22 20:47:46,eshnx4,"Definitely rougher on women than men. It's better now, what with the body positive movement, but even here you never see men being called landwhales - that term is reserved exclusively for women. Plus add in the constant barrage of weight loss products and makeup and hair products and whatever else thrown at women.  Men are supposed to what, work out and maybe shave.  That's about it."
1078,2020-01-22 20:36:17,eshnx4,The ripped freaky physique needed to the Mr. Olympia contests appeal primarily to other men.
1079,2020-01-22 21:23:58,eshnx4,"I don't think so...  


There is greater variability in the body type that men find ideal vs women."
1080,2020-01-22 23:59:55,eshnx4,"Silly question, yes.  It‚Äôs all they got.  Guys have a few different angles to play if they are not traditionally attractive."
1081,2020-01-22 20:30:31,eshnx4,"Can you change the flair of your post to ""tellwomen"" that would fit it better.

To answer your question, yes I do not think they are ""rougher"" for women than men."
1082,2020-01-23 04:38:02,eshnx4,"Yes. Men are just yolked that now the wheel spins both directions. Of course if you go from not needing any work to equal work it seems like an extreme change.

Most dudes shower wear t-shirts boxers and jeans. Shave brush teeth and hair and put on some old spice.

Woman shower dry brush straighten spray hair. Brush teeth, use lotion. Use primar concilar foundation bronzer highlights blush eyebrow pen eyeliner mascara lip gloss and setting spray perfume then they slither into fashionable clothes that have no pockets or room for last night's dinner. 

You want top teir? Waste trainer teeth caps lip injection false lashes, hair extensions fake nails push up bras to name a few.

Name one brand of Spanx for men. Woman do way more on average for looks then men. Way more"
1083,2020-01-22 20:58:50,eshnx4,Yes
1084,2020-01-23 00:30:05,eshnx4,"Man. You can tell that women are completely full of shit when they talk about muscle. Anyway, when you take into account hair, height, and facial structure, women are way more superficial."
1085,2020-01-23 00:41:49,eshnx4,"I still agree with the old school idea that it‚Äôs harder for women, but the gap is closing.

Beauty is great and all, but given diminishing returns, it‚Äôs best to improve everything (social skills, texting, clothing) a bit rather than trying to get a perfect body. 

Also, I think men try too hard to impress other men, and women other women. Use your brain before you decide to be the largest gymbro or the perfect IG egirl with 10 surgeries, maybe that‚Äôs not your cup of tea."
1086,2020-01-23 01:29:51,eshnx4,"Body standards by what?

I don't think that there are going to be a lot of females that like that male you posted.

It seems to me that males practice this kind of fitness to make other males jealous more than anything."
1087,2020-01-23 01:51:59,eshnx4,"Depends what circles you run in. I see white guys have very strict standards for women. They wouldn't even be my friend if they catch me with a fat chick.

Guys that I grew up with have less body standards for women."
1088,2020-01-23 04:25:42,eshnx4,"Likely equal. The grass is always greener on the other side.

We each get judged for different things which makes it hard to compare. Honestly I think most things I hear women consider difficult are trivial and can be dismissed, while I see women dismiss the things that to me seem difficult and important."
1089,2020-01-23 05:46:11,eshnx4,yes they are.
1090,2020-01-23 10:23:26,eshnx4,"Women put pressure on other women to look good. Men don't care and will generally fuck anything. There's plenty of grossly overweight women with male admirers. You can really look like anything as a woman and you'll still have plenty of men attracted to you.

Men have genuine pressure to look good. Being average as a man doesn't cut it - women will ignore you. You need to be top 20% in looks for women to start considering you attractive. The male equivalent of a fat ugly woman would be a guaranteed virgin for life, unless he paid for hookers."
1091,2020-01-23 11:19:49,eshnx4,"Women: Don't be obese (and present yourself well)

Men: Be part of the top 5%

You can say the same about women. Of course men love big boobs/butts/ratios/etc but they are far from a requirement for a girl to be attractive.

Where you are getting confused is this: it‚Äôs a lower barrier for women to get instant sexual interest based on physique alone.

rocky horror intimates that the unleashing of the gay aesthetic into the pubic eye (represented by PanSexual alpha Frank's creation, Rocky. pansexual alpha is another part of the theory id have to expand on later) will actually EXPOSE women to a physical appearance in men they had heretofore pretty much not been exposed to much and didnt even know they could like *\[ frank asks janet what she thinks of rocky and she says ""i dont like men with too many muscles"" and then later during the reprise of the song ""i can make you a man"" she interrupts franks act to sing ""im a muscle fannn""\]*.  i am sure you either know or remember that the gym physique touted now used to exist almost exclusively in the Gayborhood  and tom of finland cartoons and that the most attractive male physiques to women were the runners body and rock star.

this coupled with the psychological emancipation and disinhibition of the good girls *\[""i feel released"" janets line in the burlesque show scene\]* is finally coming to fruition in this generation where homoerotic presentations of muscled men tailored to the male gaze are so prominent and male actors are being chosen by the gay mafia in hollywood for a homoerotic gaze appearance has finally bred a female interest in the gay male aesthetic. *\[ i think this was also brought to the fore earlier by herb ritt's videos for* [*madonnas cherish*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q2WS6ahCnY) *and janet jacksons* [*love will never do with out you.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRVabbvUzpo) *\]* OLD has exacerbated this by causing women to choose men based SOLELY on their first impression of a photograph without ANY Other markers of male attractiveness to go on

Very slender men can face stigma for not appearing powerful.‚Äù

They used BMI, which means that men with a lot of muscle could also be classified as overweight. Therefore men's observations that putting some muscle on helps, is true. But slender men do get a decent amount of action as well. Overall, it seems like men with more muscle or more weight on them tend to have more sex. 

Supporting anecdote: I used to write for a newspaper back in the day, specifically sport. I never met a bodybuilder who struggled to get a date or have casual sex.

Athletes are high-t and muscular but they are not an exception. Regular, everyday men can be high-t and muscular.

1415,2020-01-24 02:53:24,eshnx4,"What you think I'm some kind of keto bro? HAHA, gross.

Whole food plant based diet is the way to go. No added oils. If you're going to eat meat limit it and only game meat or wild caught fish. Supplement iron, b12 and zinc is the first round of defense if you're feeling a lack from less meat. (Oysters have high amount of zinc, animal liver for iron, are best ways to get these nutrientes without supplements. I think supplements are equally as effective) 

There's nothing wrong with carbs from whole plant sources. Sweet potatoes, potatoes, unprocessed rice, Ezekiel bread if you tolerate wheat, barley, oats, Millet, squash. These are carbs to eat.

Not to mention almost all fruits and veggies besides avocado, coconut, are carb heavy, and there is no issue with eating a mostly fruit and veggie diet.

Avocado in moderation. Nuts in extreme moderation (usually roasted and salty to induce addictive food tendencies, if you eat them eat them raw). Seeds are great, best to stick to chia and flax for the ALA and phytonutrients however. 

Oils none

Meat limit to game meat or wild caught fish

Legumes in general amounts, build it up so your gut bacteria can adjust. Small amounts gradually increasing. Most people digest the legume they're used to growing up with best indians usually garbanzo, lentil. White people kidney beans, baked beans, for example. If you have little experience with legumes go with lentils first

I'm not just trolling here, we can bring to message I'll show you my instagram and my girlfriends that eat similarly without restriction maintaining a flat stomach.

The reasoning a few things. So pretty much all whole plant foods have a low caloric density. You end up really eating a lot volume wise. Secondly, you're satiating the desire for carbs instead of trying to fight it with artificial sweeteners or filling with fatty foods and you actually feel satisfied. Thirdly since you don't have excessive fat in the diet it won't be disrupting glucose metabolism because fat causes sugar to sit in blood rather then fuel cells as lipids disrupt insulin communication.

Being genuine here I'm not trying to argue or something. I'm honestly just negatively passionate about the diet culture that is doing silly things for ""health"" or ""lose weight"" that are band-aid fixes to a nutritious lifestyle that naturally brings you where you should be. I used to be that low carb gym dude and I would do leangains IF etc etc. It worked but it kind of gave me an eating disorder. I heavily prefer eating intuitively, but intuitive eating only works if you're giving yourself the right stuff

So yeah, your last sentence I can attest to. But once I dropped the low carb nonsense and ate only whole foods and dropped oils and fatty meat, it was like night and fucking day. I swear I ate more calories than usual and would wake up like the day before or leaner (and I could tell because I was relatively lean from dieting before)"

You need to lift during pregnancy to stay fit.

The women who aren't doing this are probably just dumb. Many of them will get dumped in short order.

What I'm doing works for me, being in ketosis kills my appetite so I can eat a low cal diet and work out without wanting to kill myself. I used to eat very similar to what you describe, but found that around age 28 or so I started getting hungrier and hungrier and needing to eat less and less to stay slim.

Getting a toned, muscular body is simply lifting and dieting. Train right and you'll find that you spend only 30 minutes in the gym. Eat right, and you'll find that your meals don't have to be extravagant. I understand the dedication of working out as I do it myself and fit in some more important things I have to get done in my day. If you don't enjoy it, however, then you are just punishing yourself. One of the most important things about exercise is approaching it in ways you can enjoy.

Women generally say whatever they perceive to be socially acceptable. It's socially acceptable for women to say that they like muscular men, so that's what they say. 

In reality most women aren't into guys, a large part don't know what they're into, and those who are into guys either don't care (cuz dick is dick) or they're into guys who aren't socially acceptable to be into such as perverts, creeps, weird guys etc."

Oh ffs that's bull. These are anonymous studies, people are are more honest when they're anonymous.

I don't know where you got this from, but it's the opposite for most women.

Most women are going to assume that a fit guy expects a fit girl. And they don't want to live up to that standard.

Also muscles don't do anything for women sexually. A muscular man will often come across as try-hard.

&#x200B;

>Oh ffs that's bull. These are anonymous studies, people are are more honest when they're anonymous.

Nope. Women will lie in anonymous surveys. There's a study that proves this.

&#x200B;

>True that, she's into the resources he provides.

So the only reason why most women would cheat is because the other guy has more money. Getting dick from Johnny Bravo vs getting dick from Fred Flintstone is same-same."

1555,2020-01-21 23:35:03,es20wy,No they can't basketball is subjective. Nothing is concrete. You could very much argue kobe is closer to being better than lebron than lebron is to jordan.Its not cut and dry and a personal list can't be wrong

1557,2020-01-22 04:01:26,es20wy,"Now we are counting ""points in the finals""? So it doesn't matter if you win anymore, only how many points you've scored in the finals?


Championships seems stupid to you because you know it's a losing argument on your part.  You know what's an even stupider argument? Comparing a player who in:


2015-2016 attempted 684 FG inside the restricted area in comparison to 121 by Kobe (Difference: 563)


2014-2015 attempted 455 FG inside the restricted area in comparison to 120 by Kobe (Difference: 335)

2013-2014 attempted 581 FG inside the restricted area in comparison to 12 by Kobe (Knee year)


2012-2013 attempted 541 FG inside the restricted area in comparison to 392 by Kobe (Difference: 149)


2011-2012 attempted 415 FG inside the restricted area in comparison to 212 by Kobe (Difference: 203)

2010-2011 attempted 497 FG inside the restricted area in comparison to 304 by Kobe (Difference: 193)


2009-2010 attempted 537 FG inside the restricted area in comparison to 345 by Kobe (Difference: 192)


2008-2009 attempted 553 FG inside the restricted area in comparison to 356 by Kobe (Difference: 197)


2007-2008 attempted 631 FG inside the restricted area in comparison to 431 by Kobe (Difference: 200)


2006-2007 attempted 569 FG inside the restricted area in comparison to 406 by Kobe (Difference: 163)


2005-2006 attempted 668 FG inside the restricted area in comparison to 451 by Kobe (Difference: 217)


2004-2005 attempted 557 FG inside the restricted area in comparison to 372 by Kobe (Difference: 185)


2003-2004 attempted 515 FG inside the restricted area in comparison to 389 by Kobe (Difference: 126)


So let's see EXCLUDING the year Kobe sat out most of the year, Lebron has shot 2,723 more shots inside the restricted area (not the paint) than Kobe in the years they have been in the league together. So you are comparing a player who was primarily a jumpshooter from mid-range to a player who over the span of 11 or so years, shot almost 3000 more shots inside the restricted area (not the paint, just restricted area), and yet we are supposed to be amazed that he missed 2500 less shots? Congratulations man, Lebron can make most of his fucking layups/dunks.  He's built like a fucking tank so yes, it's SOOOOO amazing that he's got a good 1500+ more made dunks/layups than Kobe. /s


Comparing Lebron and Kobe as if they play the same position or were even remotely similar in playing styles is a dumber argument than comparing their success winning championships.  Maybe you should reconsider your use of individual stats in your arguments."
1558,2020-01-22 15:10:56,es20wy,"he had 3 seasons of shooting above 35% from 3, he had 12 seasons of shooting over 45% from the field but none above 47%. 

additionally, he had 8 seasons with TS% > 55% and only 2 seasons with it higher than 57%

Im not saying he isnt one of the 11 or 12 best players ever, but it isnt like his last couple of seasons tanked his career efficiency. He was never a super efficient scorer.

edit: imagine downvoting objective facts because you dont like them"
1559,2020-01-21 23:33:47,es20wy,True making more on the same attempts per game is. How hard can it be to understand logic. The person is the better shooter that makes more not misses more. God why do i bother

1565,2020-01-21 23:42:28,es20wy,Like I said you could look at accolades and see that kobe is either tied or has more of everything except MVP's with lebron. Its subjective if you have kobe over lebron then you have kobe over lebron there is nothing saying that lebron is the 2nd greatest or 3rd greatest ever. That's just popular opinion and just that an opinion.
1566,2020-01-22 04:11:35,es20wy,"What's his free throw percentage again? Remind me again, whose 3pt shot was so disrespected around the league that the opposing defense DARED him to shoot it...in an NBA FINALS!!!?"

1568,2020-01-21 23:57:57,es20wy,"Ok not trying to argue Kobe vs lebron but since your simple minded and turning it into that let's add context than. 

Kobe played in the triangle which infamously brings down assists numbers. 

In 5 seasons not playing in the triangle he averages 6 assists in 3 of them not a bad playmaker. 

Compare kobe and lebrons scoring numbers from lebron year 2 to when he won his 2nd ring  vs Kobe the same years kobe outscored him and the efficiency was really close .561 ts% for Kobe and .579 for lebron. 

You talk about being a better shooter but on open  3s he shoots worse from 3 than year 18 Kobe which is one if his most inefficient years. 

In from 01-04 Shaq only outscored kobe in 2 series out of 18 series think about that. Shaq only had more rebounds and blocks in this time

Kobe was a better perimeter defender and before you say lebron came in top 3 in DPOY voting twice Kobe came in 4th twice and one of those years he was one of only 4 players to get votes. 

Now I don't think Kobe's better but if you use context kobe seems way fucking better than people say he is"
1569,2020-01-22 01:36:31,es20wy,Kobe wasn't the best player on his team for the other 2 either.

Also the other characters that were bad but got better had comic reasons and they also ignored their problems after. The MCU isn‚Äôt going to focus on trauma or differing opinions. It sucks but it is what it is. A proper Civil War definitely would‚Äôve had radical Wanda telling Tony that he‚Äôs a hypocrite, and Tony would‚Äôve told her that she‚Äôs just as bad as he is.

1601,2020-03-28 09:06:16,fqczsn,"For transparency, I'm white, so maybe the racial element being brought up in this thread has gone over my head. But I dunno if it's really fair to level accusations like that at Marvel itself. Not in its current iteration at least, once good people took the wheel. Touchy subject to get into though...

I mean this film was almost entirely made for black people, by black people. Everyone else was free to enjoy it, but there was a target market that finally got their unrivaled champion. And as a piece of pop culture, it was its own goddamn movement. We've got the next Iron Man level draw with BP and Wakanda.

But point being, why would anyone think that a movie with a black director, directing an almost all black cast, written by two black people including the director, would have the opinion that the villain must die because he's black and means less? How can anyone see this movie, and anything regarding the press tour or interviews around it, and think that the people making the movie's decisions would think this way about a black villain? And Feige surely can't be accused of bias like that. I've seen him mention wanting Black Panther in the mix since as early as IM2. And he basically stuck his neck out and got the MCU on track to actually go with material like BP.

I dunno, maybe I'm kinda blind to things like this cause I've just never understood how anyone could bring stuff like this into anything. It doesn't even enter into my thought process about the movie. Honestly I've just always thought Killmonger was a fantastic villain with a tragic story. He's one of the best villains the MCU's seen. MBJ knocked it out of the park. If anything, people tend to say he outdid the hero. And with his tragic story, I mean he's given a seriously bleak hand of cards as a kid, and has to fight like a warrior his entire life to get anywhere, and is filled with hate and resentment because of that. And through his own actions, he ends up killed far too early in his life, and his life ends as tragically as it started.

Also, I would argue that there's lots of villains who have been killed off just like Killmonger. Stane, Vanko, FakeMandarin, Kurse, Malekith, Pierce, Ronan, Ultron, Cross, Kaecilius, Ego, Hela, Mysterio (possibly) were all individual movie villains who were killed off. Loki, Thanos, all of the Black Order are all multi film villains who end up dead. Loki was mostly a special case cause he was more or less more popular than the hero he was supposed to be secondary to, and it's one character that can be brought back within the narrative and have it make perfect sense. I'm not saying Killmonger was necessarily 100% dead, never to return if they want him back, they could just explain it away that T'Challa couldn't let him die, and have that on his conscience, so he brought him back to the lab and they in fact brought him back because he was still technically alive. But the end of that movie had Killmonger state he preferred to die rather than be imprisoned forever. A parallel can be seen with Loki's imprisonment after Avengers, though I do think there's a massive gulf of difference in the tone of the films. BP was a much more serious affair. Thor and Loki and Asgard is a lot more theatrical and pie in the sky compared to the more grounded tale we get in BP. It just feels like one outcome fit within one character's arc, and one fit within the other. At least that's how I read it. Tbh, at a certain point, Loki returning feels cheap. I really hope Main Loki doesn't return after Infinity War, like some try and theory their way past.

Of course, if anyone is of the opinion that Killmonger had to die because he was a bad guy, and black, therefore he can't be left alive, then obviously the person with that opinion is fucked up and the kind of person I can't stand. If someone had that opinion about Mordo in DS2, because he's going to become a villain, and he's black, therefore he must die and can't be redeemed, then that's fucked up too and I would fight that just as hard.

Maybe I'm not as informed as I need to be on this. This has certainly opened my eyes to something I didn't even realise was a thing."
1602,2020-03-28 04:19:29,fqczsn,"Loki started bad and then tried to do good, but still had unforgivable actions.  

Killmonger was the same. He intended to kill millions of people, largely based on race no less."

Black Widow never went to prison. She was an assassin. 

Hulk and Stark killed thousands in Ultron. They never went to prison. 

Loki hilled hundreds. He tried to murder his own father. He murdered a frost giant in cold blood. He was a hero by the end and gets a spin-off. 

Gamora committed genocide with Thanos. She gets a pass. 

Bucky murdered Stark‚Äôs parents.

1628,2020-03-28 07:28:27,fqczsn,"I disagree.

At their core they have a very similar struggle, but Magneto is definitely not a megalomaniac who kills for pleasure. That's kind of the key difference.

Magneto isn't asking for some nation to use their resources to protect mutants. He's finding his own resources to take care of them himself.. or he's stopping the government or hate groups from hurting mutants.

Also, Magneto would WANT to live because he knows that he has many things to still offer the world. Killmonger wouldn't have an out and probably wouldn't change his tactics. I think the point of showing his vision of his dad and him still being a child was to show that he was never capable of changing or compromise, whereas I feel like Magneto is much more willing to compromise or play the long game. For Magneto.. there is no end of the road. He can keep going, always persevering and trying to fight for Mutants. For Killmonger, the Black Panther movie WAS the long game and he died at the end of the road. There was nowhere else to go after his defeat."
1629,2020-03-28 07:12:04,fqczsn,"That is kind of my point. Loki was by far the worst villain (outside of Thanos but we didn‚Äôt know him until Infinity War or even how terrible he was until Endgame). Yet in Thor 3, Loki cracks a couple jokes and he‚Äôs a hero. 

Killmonger was trying to save a group of people and elevate them up to where everyone else was. 

And he was killed. The only other Marvel character like him is Lang (going to prison for what he did) and he was made an Avenger. Gamora was terrible as Thanos‚Äô #1. Drax was a murderer. Stark built weapons that murdered innocent people. Bucky was a murderer. Black widow was an assassin. Even Cap felt he was better than everyone else and above the law. 

But Killmonger? A guy trying to use tech to do away with poverty? Let‚Äôs kill him."
1630,2020-03-28 05:29:23,fqczsn,He‚Äôs almost certainly tied to a multi film deal and he‚Äôs been extremely open about wanting to potentially return

1637,2020-03-29 17:08:48,fqczsn,Exactly this. A lot of these folks are so mired in racism that they don't even realize that they are exposing themselves.
1638,2020-03-29 11:16:36,fqczsn,"Are you missing the whole part of exactly how Killmonger was seeking to do that? He was going to be a dictator basically, and use the superior technology to enforce his will on the world.

Of course, his notion of helping other people like him wasn't a bad thing, and he had valid arguments. Notice he's one of the only villains to actually change the hero's mind? His ideas were sound, as far as helping his community etc, but his ends and where he wanted to take that went into villain territory. One criticism I've seen of the film is that they basically make him go full on villain in order to show who's the bad guy.

I've already listed exampled of villains who never got a second chance. And of the ones you listed, only one was even a villain, Loki. I dunno what you mean about Thanos getting a second chance. Obviously, there's a different kind of treatment when it comes to heroes than it does to villains. If someone's intended to be a hero from the start, it's a bit different from a villain who holds firm on their beliefs and refuses to stay alive because they can't move forward knowing their goals didn't pan out."
1639,2020-03-28 06:05:18,fqczsn,"According to Civil War, less than 100 people died in the Battle of New York. Not disproving you, Loki was insane for a while, but there were a shockingly low amount of deaths."

1641,2020-03-28 09:23:56,fqczsn,"Lots of projection happening in this thread. Are you forgetting the recurring white character who was, by your logic, just trying to run a successful business who was killed *by Killmonger*?

And Killmonger wasn't trying to just ""do away with poverty"", he was trying to start a World War. He literally says ""this time we're gonna be on top"". He's not a leveler, he's just another oppressor, and T'Challa sees through him. And yet T'Challa still wanted to save him. Killmonger made a choice, remember?

Oh, and Lang was in prison for returning money which had been stolen via legal loopholes. That is in no way comparable to creating an army, whether it's an army of disenfranchised or not."
1642,2020-03-28 07:16:32,fqczsn,"I totally agree with you.
It is nothing but societies tendency to be unforgiving to black men.
Loki, Ghost,Drax,Widow, all killers, redeemed and forgiven.

Killmonger, dies from an injury in the one place where that injury isn't remotely life threatening."
1643,2020-04-07 08:26:05,fqczsn,"Plus, as far as I know, he's expressed nothing but positive feedback about his role and his relationship with the rest of the cast."
1644,2020-03-28 07:06:54,fqczsn,Care to elaborate?
1645,2020-03-28 04:42:04,fqczsn,"I agree. In a lot of ways, Wakanda was the villain and Killmonger was trying to help people. The line that sticks with me is, ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt life start right here on this continent? So ain‚Äôt all people your people?‚Äù

To have so much power that could have been used for so much good...freeing a whole segment of people systematically held in captivity...when Black Panther killed his dad for trying to help people...and to do nothing but hoard it for yourself...

I can see where Killmonger was coming from."
1646,2020-03-28 08:20:20,fqczsn,"I feel like the number Fury gives in that ""he's adopted"" scene was something like 80. And that was before the battle proper. But even then, 180 deaths isn't that much really."
1647,2020-03-28 06:10:42,fqczsn,Thanks for that tidbit.
1648,2020-03-28 07:18:54,fqczsn,"Agreed. And it‚Äôs Michael Fucking B. Fucking Jordan. 

What a waste. It‚Äôs too bad."
1649,2020-03-28 07:07:47,fqczsn,"Loki‚Äôs jealous of his jock brother? Like what?

Killmonger is angry at the systemic oppression of all black people on the entire planet. That‚Äôs not the same."

1651,2020-03-28 06:07:38,fqczsn,"Wakanda was the villain and Killmonger was trying to help people. 

Except the part where he wanted to kill a lot of people...

The line that sticks with me is, ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt life start right here on this continent? So ain‚Äôt all people your people?‚Äù

If all people are his people (which I actually agree with completely), why would he want to do the same thing to them that was done to him? He becomes the thing he is supposedly against.

I can see where Killmonger was coming from.

Repeating a cycle and expecting a different outcome doesn‚Äôt fix the problem, it prolongs it. Which is why T‚ÄôChalla was the hero. He made the decision to stop repeating the stupidity of racism/elitism/segregation."
1652,2020-03-28 06:11:18,fqczsn,Those police that cap yelled at must‚Äôve done a good job on that perimeter
1653,2020-03-28 07:09:31,fqczsn,And why does that mean Killmonger had to die? I don't see your point.
1654,2020-03-28 06:19:32,fqczsn,"You‚Äôre not wrong. But why were all those other characters allowed to change their evil views/ways and Killmonger killed off? Why not keep him around and let him evolve like you did with all the characters I mentioned? 

Killmonger had some good in his philosophy...and some bad. But so did T‚ÄôChalla. Both were guilty and both had blood on their hands."
1655,2020-03-28 06:20:08,fqczsn,Ha ha. Watching Cap kick alien ass puts the get up in your step.
1656,2020-03-28 07:10:38,fqczsn,Killmonger isn‚Äôt going to fold on his cause. There‚Äôs no winning to him. You can‚Äôt stop the oppression of all black people. All he would do is do the same thing over and over. He‚Äôs not a character who would change
1657,2020-03-28 06:24:19,fqczsn,"I am not well versed in his comic stories, but did Killmonger ever have a redemption arc in those books? They may have just gone with the original?"
1658,2020-03-28 07:12:28,fqczsn,"> You can‚Äôt stop the oppression of all black people. 

What? What does that even mean? 

And what does that have to do with the character dying?"
1659,2020-03-28 07:12:41,fqczsn,"Sure, but you could lock him up. Put him in a Wakandan prison. Where he can plan all he wants to but we never see him. But, in the off chance they want to use him again he‚Äôs still there."
1660,2020-03-28 06:27:26,fqczsn,"You know, I have no idea. My knowledge of Killmonger is 100% movie based."
1661,2020-03-28 07:20:12,fqczsn,Because that's WHY he died. T'Challa offered to heal him and he literally said no. He didn't want to be a prisoner. He wanted to die to make his point. I don't see what is not clear here.
1662,2020-03-28 07:21:04,fqczsn,Why? That's not tragic and it gives him no power. He had power in his death... and he was literally right about his core argument.
1663,2020-03-28 07:28:59,fqczsn,"It's bullshit reasoning. He said I want to be like my ancestors on the slave ships that jumped overboard.

It ignored the reality that he had many more ancestors on the continent that were not slaves.

It's typical colonizer thinking that says that black peoples history begins at slavery. It's bullshit. It's bad writing.

If he was a revolutionary, he'd want to live to rescue his people another day.

As I said, it's nothing but a penchant to find black men disposable.

The scene would've been just as powerful if he made that statement and Tchalla saved him anyway.

Tchalla can rescue the man that killed his father, but not his own cousin? GARBAGE"
1664,2020-03-28 07:29:45,fqczsn,Why must black stories end in tragedy? What can't they end in redemption? Or triumph?
1665,2020-03-28 07:33:50,fqczsn,"What do you want him to do? Rot in prison? There's nowhere for him to go. There's no other game plan. He's one pretty ordinary man. Wakanda was the end of the road.

I think it was obvious that he wasn't exactly a revolutionary figure. He was a bad person who killed people for his own pleasure. His message was correct but... he's a cold-blooded killer with no empathy for anyone (which is obviously tragic because it comes from the way he was brought up). He was lost and he funneled all of his energy to this goal that he had... but didn't have anything outside of that. It makes you angry, which means that he is a good villain who resonates with people. But I don't think there's a way forward for him as a character. He doesn't want to change, he doesn't actually care about anything, and he doesn't have a path forward as a character."
1666,2020-03-29 11:06:42,fqczsn,"Bucky wanted to be saved. Killmonger outright refused. T'Challa allowed him the dignity to choose. Notice he had the same choice with Zemo, and didn't afford him the same courtesy. Because he had a level of caring with Killmonger. Whereas Zemo was no one to him, just an asshole who killed his father. He was sparing Killmonger from being a prisoner for the rest of his life. If anything, it was an act of mercy.

None of these were the same situations, and to expect the exact same results and the character to make the exact same decisions in each case is silly."
1667,2020-03-28 07:38:44,fqczsn,"Why do you think that ONE character dying is because of him being black and it's a part of some awful trope or whatever else. Like, I'm sorry you feel that way but there's so much more that contributed towards his death.

He died for his cause. He believed in nothing else and he wasn't capable of it because he was literally psychopathic. He wasn't willing to change. There was no path forward for his character.

T'Challa offered to save Killmonger and he told his ancestors that they were wrong to keep Wakanda hidden and help no one else. He is literally trying to redeem Wakanda."
1668,2020-03-28 15:46:26,fqczsn,"This is my point. The movie puts out the premise that Killmonger‚Äôs options are prison or death. Why? Bucky never went to prison. Cap never went to prison. Drax never went back to prison. Gamora never went to prison.  Loki kind of did, but he escaped in Endgame.

Why can‚Äôt Killmonger have the same redemption ark as all the other characters? Why do all the other hero‚Äôs get the opportunity to be good and Killmonger gets death or prison?"
1669,2020-03-29 14:56:05,fqczsn,">  He was sparing Killmonger from being a prisoner for the rest of his life.

You are creating this scenario.

And I am saying that it is an issue with the writing, not an in movie decision."
1670,2020-03-28 07:43:03,fqczsn,"> because he was literally psychopathic.

 >There was no path forward for his character.

You are a perfect illustration of those racist notions that I was speaking of.

Nothing about the character spoke to him being a psychopath. Nor was there any reason to believe there was no path forward.

As I said...black men are irredeemable to those steeped in racist bias. And you've just evidenced it.

I'm glad you did...maybe someone reading this can learn from your obliviousness."
1671,2020-03-28 17:45:45,fqczsn,"Killmonger isn‚Äôt going to change.

Bucky was brainwashed. Drax was killing Ronan‚Äôs minions. Gamora was kidnapped and tortured and mutilated. Loki.... is an iconic Marvel villain who... was just jealous of his brother and was doing Thanos‚Äôs bidding? All of them showed doubt about what they were doing.

Killmonger chose... of his own volition to kill tons of people. Then to come to Wakanda, overtake the country, and disperse their weapons. It is perfectly illustrated in the movie that he doesn‚Äôt care for anyone, has no ability to change or compromise, and there‚Äôs no other future for him. What do you want them to do? It wouldn‚Äôt be natural for him to just suddenly give up on his mission and become a good guy. Like??? Did you watch the movie?"
1672,2020-03-29 16:05:28,fqczsn,"Well, yes and no. The actions of Killmonger basically cornered him into death or imprisonment. Prior to his death, was EK not a great villain as he was? Would you have him back down on his plans? I personally thought that in his own way he was commendable for sticking to his guns. Would you rewrite his whole narrative to make him less combative and at odds with the heroes so he can flip and be bros at the end?

Regardless of anything else, or any of the other movies, I just found him tragic all over. He had a tragic life and his death matched that. The message of his fate was essentially that wanting conflict is not how to get ahead. And that translates into T'Challa's journey also. T'Challa was following his father's example more than he should've, and he lost because of that. And it was only after he actively reevaluated how he and Wakanda should move forward that he was able to overcome his enemy and personal demons.

Ultimately, EK's challenge, sad end and sacrifice are what gives Wakanda the leader it really needs."
1673,2020-03-28 07:52:52,fqczsn,"Dude. He LITERALLY killed people for his own pleasure. That's like... movie 101 psychopath. 

What's his path forward? PLEASE fucking detail this to me. He escapes Wakanda and tries to do the exact same fucking shit he did in the first movie?????? There's LITERALLY no path forward. He wouldn't WANT to change. He wouldn't WANT to compromise. I don't see how you don't see this. What do you want him to do? What else can he do to further his goal to liberate black people and end oppression? Wakanda was the ONLY tool capable of that. He has no powers. He has no sociopolitical pull or resources. What do you expect from this character? I truly feel like you're refusing to even analyze who he is and you're trying to reach to make this be a bigger problem than it is.

Does the MCU historically suck with it's female characters and characters of color? Duh. I'm literally one of the people who ALWAYS gets downvoted on this sub because I complain about how diversity is lacking in the MCU. I am not your enemy. You feel a certain way, and you think it's because of his race. Sure, that's fine. Whatever. However, I disagree and I don't think this is a race issue.

You're also not factoring how T'Challa is a different character than most in the MCU. He isn't someone who will try to hold power over you, or rub it in your face that you lost. He allowed his cousin... a man who was deeply wronged by Wakanda to die with a sense of his own dignity. He didn't rub it in his face that he lost or anything else. In comparison: look how he treated Zemo. He knew Zemo was wrong for killing his father in cold blood and deserved to sit out the rest of his days in prison.

If you think the movie is so racist then blame it on the black writers, directors, actors, producer, director of photography, set designer, costume designer, etc. for making a character that has no redeeming qualities and who... wouldn't even want to be redeemed."
1674,2020-03-28 18:23:47,fqczsn,"Huh? EVERYONE changed in these movies? But the one black villain? 

‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt change‚Äù. 

Come on. Loki meant to enslave the earth. Gamora helped Thanos commit genocide on countless planets. Bucky murdered people in cold blood. So did Black Widow.  

Why do these characters get redemption stories and Killmonger doesn‚Äôt? 

I can‚Äôt think of a marvel villain who wasn‚Äôt given a second chance. Even Thanos got a do over. Loki had
Multiple second chances. 

But not Killmonger. He‚Äôs the one villain unwilling to change? 

I doubt that. A real life Killmonger, after seeing T‚ÄôChalla apologize and change, would want to team up and take Wakanda to the world. 

I find it interesting we can forgive all these villains, who did a lot worse than Killmonger ever did, but he is past redemption. 

Why? 

Because I can only see on thing that separates him from the other villains."
1675,2020-03-29 16:18:24,fqczsn,"Dont try to conflate my opinion with other nonsense about the Killmonger character.

I've been very clear. Black men are treated as irredeemable, and you feed into this same foolishness.

Your notion that he must be imprisoned for life in a film series where Loki is viewed as a fan favorite is utter bullshit.

Nothing Killmonger did is equal to the crimes Loki committed, but in your head a life of imprisonment, or death are the only two choices available for the character.

It's tacit racism, and you are consciously or unconsciously supporting it."
1676,2020-03-28 08:03:33,fqczsn,"> Dude. He LITERALLY killed people for his own pleasure.

Seems like you are now making things up. This getting worse and worse.

You sound really ignorant. There is no Wakanda in the real world smart guy.
You think black people are just doomed to an eternity of second class citizenship?
You are sounding really ignorant right now.

>If you think the movie is so racist then blame it on the black writers, directors, actors, producer, director of photography, set designer, costume designer, etc.

See I knew I had figured you out. 

You are one of those friendly moderates that secretly believe black people are second class. Your words reek of it.

It's coming out more and more every comment."
1677,2020-03-28 18:41:02,fqczsn,"Killmonger has powers. He drank the flower, the same as Black Panther. He is literally another Black Panther."
1678,2020-03-28 18:26:39,fqczsn,"Dude. Besides Loki, you're literally talking about people who were traumatized, brainwashed, and abused... and putting them on the same level as Killmonger.

Killmonger wouldn't want to change. What about this is so hard. He never doubted his beliefs, and showed that he isn't open to compromise or change. How do you move forward with this character? Wakanda was the endgame for him. There's nothing else he could do afterwards. Like............... It's simple. He literally had no narrative future. His story ran out of fuel."
1679,2020-03-29 16:38:02,fqczsn,"Other nonsense? Okay, great talk.

I've never said Loki shouldn't have been punished for his bullshit. There's little difference in how the Asgardians and Earth would consider Loki, compared to Wakanda and EK. I think the biggest reason Loki was kept around was because the MCU was still finding its feet by Thor 2 and they were grasping for anything they knew would work. Plus he was more popular than the hero and at the time, good villains were in short supply. Also the plan was to kill him off in Thor 2, that's how the film was made. Then they changed their minds and he'd been tricky in the end credits. But I know any details I could bring up are going in one ear and out the other.

With EK as he was in the movie, what possible end is there for him outside either being killed, or caught and imprisoned by Wakanda, because he can never really be trusted, or on the run for the rest of his life? He caused civil war and brought a country to breaking point.

And in the end, he and Loki are very different characters, in very different parts of the MCU, who go about things in vastly different ways. Nobody's saying one deserves more screentime over the other because one's white or one's black, who even talks or thinks like that?

And no I'm not racist, jfc. All I've said is that the way EK is portrayed, that portrayal lead to an outcome that wasn't going to be good news for him. I don't think he should've been killed or locked up just because he was a black villain. You're putting words in others mouths (unless anyone comes out with vomit like this, then fuck em).

Mordo for example, he'll obviously return as a villain later on in DS's story. Do I think there's no end for him other than death or imprisonment? No, because his character hasn't displayed the same kind of things EK did. And the situation with that character is entirely different. Because things aren't always black and white, literally, or good and bad, or right or wrong. Mordo, like EK, has a point. Perhaps fucking with time will come back to haunt Strange. Just like treating EK like shit as a kid came back to haunt Wakanda.

Also Ghost isn't white, and she's directly been given the opportunity for redemption.

Klaue WAS white, and he wasn't given the opportunity to redeem himself.

You're cherry picking hard here."
1680,2020-03-28 10:41:10,fqczsn,Yikes @ ur obvious trolling lol
1681,2020-03-28 18:37:26,fqczsn,"How was Killmonger not brainwashed? His father was murdered by Black Panther. He grew up in poor, drug riddled Oakland. He wasn‚Äôt any different than any of the other villains who get a pass. Yet, his only option is death or prison. 

As for him not wanting to change...every other baddie turned good had a chance to change. 

Bucky didn‚Äôt want to change. Yet Cap goes rouge to save him and change him. Cap imprisons him to get him to change. 

Your saying that if T‚ÄôChalla says, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre right, I‚Äôve hidden a power to free poor people and we should team up and take this to the world‚Äù Killmonger is gonna go ‚Äúnah, I wanna kill white people?‚Äù

Your bias and obliviousness are beyond almost anything I've ever seen.

YOU feel that the story is done because you fail to be even capable of imagining character development.

Something that you have no issue imagining for Loki.

Racism, as I've said.

But cognitive dissonance is unsurprising in those steeped in antiblack bias.

Your last comment about Ghost is the most telling. You say she isn't white, when the only parent we've seen on screen was her white one.

She is as white as she is black...but you've chosen to discount an entire side of her."

1684,2020-03-28 18:58:07,fqczsn,Umm?? Yes that‚Äôs literally his whole character. You‚Äôre being ridiculous.
1685,2020-03-29 20:04:29,fqczsn,"Lol you literally reply by cherry picking. I don't say any of that because he's black, I say it because he made a play for the throne, was bested, and represents a very serious threat. T'Challa isn't in training anymore, he's the actual king now and has to make decisions to serve and rule his country as best as he can. Letting someone like Killmonger go would be fucking ridiculous.

I said that, in the context of how he is in the movie. You could reply with something like, yes, but they didn't have to portray him like that when writing. Which is true, but at the same time, you're in the minority who don't think he was written well and acted well and a highlight of the movie.

No, you're just projecting your own shit onto me again. I can imagine a tonne a character development. I've had lengthy discussions about MCU characters. The one I'm looking forward to most is probably Sam stepping up into the limelight. I can't wait for their show. Anthony's a legend and he has an epic relationship with Seb.

Dude what the actual fuck.

I have never looked into details about her, yet I would hazard a guess that she's partially black. Let's see. Wow, what do you know, wiki says she has a Nigerian father. Wait, the way you word your stupid comment. Lol, you mean the character's parent? Lol, fuck. Yeah, the actor has one white parent, and the parent they show on screen is a white father.

Here's the thing. I never discounted the white portion of her, I merely pointed out that she's black. I never said she's 100% black, because you can tell by looking at her that she isn't. But she is half black. Are you saying she isn't black because she has one white parent? Maybe you're the racist fuck here.

Notice you also glossed over the fact that this is a character and actor who are half black, and are, I'll repeat myself, given a direct opportunity to redeem themselves, and probably will in some form moving forward, yet you keep fixating on one particular character.

Some villains are one movie villains. Plenty of villains have appeared in one movie in the MCU and been killed off. Generally the ones that aren't, are ones that were always intended to become heroes in the end anyway, or they're not killed but still punished.

1694,2020-03-26 04:59:46,fp4qh3,"Alot of the things you are referring to are things that were created when diversity wasn't expressed in such types of media. So POC playing a character that was white is just diversifying as normally that character's story is not related to their whiteness. When a character is often a POC there are often cultural temes/ties/etc. attached to that person so when they are replaced by white actors either: 

A.) Those cultural themes that were key to that character and their development are erased. Or even just the fact that a character being a POC in the time they existed or in that media was created was iconic in itself while also holding other cultural ties, thus reducing the character's significance. 

B.) A white actor is quite literally pretending to be a POC, which if you don't get why that's wrong on your own you'll never accept further explanation. (Chances are a POC isn't ""being white"" when they take an acting role where the character was originally white)

Yes there are certainly times when any person could play a specific character. However, in the way your post is worded I feel like you are trying to make an argument for any and all roles.

Edit: If you're going to downvote because you disagree that's fine but please respond with why you don't agree to the above. I didn't say that it's always wrong but pointed out that many times it would change a significant amount of who the character is."

1698,2020-03-26 05:56:00,fp4qh3,"I've never seen Tropic Thunder nor did I know anything about it until like 10 minutes ago honestly but before I do say anything I want to make sure I have this straight because I'm a little confused. 

So the character that Robert Downey Jr. is playing is essentially ""a white man who is pretending to be a black man""?  Right? If so lots to unpack and a windy answer. Also this film was satire correct?

First of all the movie Tropic Thunder was an original creation correct? So Downey isn't replacing a black character, they simply included a rule that was blackface. HUGE ASS DIFFERENCE. Not even in the same category as your post title. At all.

Technically given the character description it would make sense that they did choose to cast a white actor instead of having a black actor the issue is that they created a role in blackface. Never at any point was this a story with an actual black character, this was a satire about ""how far actors will go"" to achieve success and this could have been done so many other ways. I understand that they probably chose a blackface role because it is so outrageous but its exactly that, extremely outrageous. There is way too much fucked up shit behind that and still going on today to even get into in this thread.

This isn't some random movie that was orginally a book with flat/undeveloped character named John that was black in the book and ended up cast as white in the movie. Which is the argument you are trying to make. 

The argument about Downey's role in Tropic Thunder is that he wore black face. The argument that is being used saying it should have been cast by a black actor is to have avoided the actual use of black face because it has nasty ass roots that were and still are racist as fuck. Now Downey isn't in the traditional overexagerated blackface makeup that was used to mock and devalue/dehumanize black people as comedic entertainment from back when but he is still painted black, portraying a black man, and portraying it through a comedic role with exaggerated and stereotypical ""black mannerisms."" So modern day blackface? Yes. Do people have the right to be pissed at that? Hell yes. People are saying it should have been played by a black man to have avoided that. Some people probably don't even feel that is appropriate, but also too big for this thread. Finding a white man and black man with similar build and features and having them co-play the role would have avoided that, because its fucked up. Should the concept have really been included? Different conversation. At least from what I read they carried it out respectably in terms of story line if that's the right way to word it. But they definitely in my opinion should have avoided actually utilizing black face."

Thielen is now the undisputed #1 target in MN"
1702,2020-03-25 16:20:45,fos694,"I would veto it.

There is simply no justification for this trade. 

I already know I disagree with the majority of dynasty players on this sub about trade vetos. I think there is a place for them outside of collusion and this is a prime example of it. A new player to dynasty comes in and immediately sends away for one of the best assets in dynasty for pennies. Using my favorite trade calculator, I had to throw in the 1.01 before I got close to evening that trade out. There is simply no arguement about valuing players differently here. This was just an extremely unbalanced trade that should never have happened. 

A trade like this is league breaking. It gives team B an extreme advantage, it ensures team A is a bottom tier team for the next couple of years, and it really pisses off the other 12 teams in the league. 

The choice was either vetoing this trade and having one unhappy owner with Team B (who knew he was getting a steal) or possibly watching this league fall apart as the other 12 teams realize they no longer want to be apart of a league where one team got so unjustly enriched."
1703,2020-03-25 15:58:35,fos694,Terrible trade but I wouldn‚Äôt veto it. People should be allowed to be bad at this.
1704,2020-03-25 15:48:29,fos694,I mean that‚Äôs an awful trade. I‚Äôm all about maintaining the integrity of the league and although that‚Äôs not a league winner it gives team B a huge advantage. Thielen and Howard could be out of the league as soon as next year. Why did the MT owner throw on a 2nd?
1705,2020-03-25 15:59:03,fos694,Is the new owner also new to dynasty leagues? I‚Äôve found in our league that the new owner doesn‚Äôt fully understand how to value players in regards to dynasty versus redraft which usually leads to some head scratching trades that upsets a few people.
1706,2020-03-25 15:45:55,fos694,"I'm in a league where something similar happened. Our commish talked to them individually and the person receiving the better end of the trade added in their first rounder and we moved on. 

For this trade even if an early/mid 2020 1st were given up that would be an incredible steal for MT. 

I agree with other comments though. I'm a fan of nixing the veto option on trades in general. Either that or there should be clear rules of what trades will/will not get overturned."
1707,2020-03-25 16:49:29,fos694,You made the right decision. A move like this dramatically changes the balance of power makes it uncompetitive.

It‚Äôs not an earth shattering trade, but a bad one. Trade should stand. Bad trades happen all the time, and time will tell how it shakes out. Vetoing this sends a bad message without bylaws. 

Edit: spelling"

Instantly putting him in the hole right from the start seems like a poor way to get a long term owner.

Get him some resources so he doesn‚Äôt become the league taco forever. The owner that would‚Äôve got MT is gonna gripe, but he knows that trade was absurd"
1711,2020-03-25 16:27:03,fos694,"Owner A doesn't know what he's doing. He probably shouldn't be in the league if he's going to  throw off league balancing, whether it is on purpose or out inexperience.

1712,2020-03-25 16:38:00,fos694,"I like the trade that you are working with them on even less actually.  If anything should be adjusted, I would suggest just removing the picks from the original deal so it‚Äôs not so much of a landslide but each team is still getting the players they originally wanted.

1713,2020-03-25 18:24:06,fos694,"It's a little bit Captain Hindsight to say this, but sounds like this new owner should not have been allowed to join the league in the first place. Entering into a league with very experienced dynasty owners as a complete beginner is a recipe for disaster. It's one thing for a bad dynasty player to make a horrible trade, it's another for someone who doesn't know any better to do the same. 

I do applaud your handling of the situation since this has the potential to create major unbalance in the league, and get that new owner some trade calculators in the meantime! That, or the new owner is Michael Thomas' personal physician, and he knows something we don't..."
1714,2020-03-25 19:42:15,fos694,"Utterly bemused by your revised version.

1717,2020-03-25 15:45:21,fos694,"Let the trade stand. 

Vetoing because a bunch of people got pissy about it and because he was begging to have it undone sets an absolutely awful precedent.

Even worse, it sounds like the bylaws spelled out that vetoes are only to be used in cases of collusion - which makes this even more cut and dry. Vetoing it becomes an abuse of commish powers at that point."
1718,2020-03-25 16:14:44,fos694,I would veto the trade and boot the new owner for being border line retarded.
1719,2020-03-25 16:11:05,fos694,"I had a similar situation happen in my league and in the end I just spoke to both owners.  The trade was awful... but not collusion and not league breaking so I let it ride.  
.         
The newer owner learned a valuable lesson about dynasty vs redraft valuation.... and the older owner knew not to pull that move again (and got a lot of grief from league mates).             
.           
Ironically in hind sight it worked out well for the newer owner but at the time it was atrocious (for those curious it was in 2018 and a SFlex league and it was Luck plus a pick for Brady)"
1720,2020-03-25 17:10:45,fos694,"Normally, I agree with the masses on the no Veto stance. However, my only exception (besides collusion), is in a league that is more casual consisting of long time friends, and it sounds like this may be the type of league you are running. My reasoning: first and foremost, with the league being friendly and casual, this is the type of trade that can really flip the entire league. If team B is now a juggernaut and rips off a title and looks set for multiple titles in a row it can literally cause the whole league to fold. 90% of the league won‚Äôt see the point of playing and start dropping like flies. Second, team A would likely be in shambles for years from this trade. As a brand new dynasty player, I doubt they would stick around just to be a bottom feeder for the foreseeable future. Again with this being a friend/casual league, it‚Äôs much harder to get someone to take over an orphan, not to mention a terrible one. In an ideal competitive league, you don‚Äôt veto for anything and let the chips fall as they will. But in a friend league, you go with the majority consensus to keep the league balanced because at the end of the day you‚Äôre playing with friends for fun and in those leagues, it‚Äôs a bad look to take the new guy to the cleaners for his best asset."
1721,2020-03-25 17:19:19,fos694,"It‚Äôs never the other owners responsibility to make sure someone doesn‚Äôt get screwed over. You can‚Äôt dictate how others perceive value. Also, if it was flipped and the more experienced and ‚Äúbetter‚Äù owner was getting the perceived lesser end of the deal, no one would likely jump to his defense. 

If you have a veto time period and it still goes through, no one has the right to bitch about it afterwards and then overrule it. That defeats the purpose of vetoing. If you can‚Äôt be bothered to vote on something before it happens, you have no right to react to it afterwards."
1722,2020-03-25 18:02:30,fos694,"As other owners have said, either veto it or don‚Äôt. 

The argument for leaving it is in the post. You said you only veto if collusion is present. I see no evidence of that here, and by the owners reaction he knows there was no collusion either. Also that‚Äôs a horrible deal in redraft as well, so that argument holds no water. 

The argument for changing it is also pretty clear. The new guy know he fucked up, but this doesn‚Äôt only impact him. Owner B got away with highway robbery, and is now probably a top 3 team in the league. This hurts everyone in the league and throws off the balance tremendously. It also severely sets the new guy back, and may turn him off to dynasty in the future. 

A revised trade is the worst option, but you suggested Boyd instead of Thielin. Are we sure Boyd is more valuable? Adam is the clear #1 in Minnesota vs. Boyd who is probably the #1 (but has AJ Green there who is much more capable than Minnesota‚Äôs number 2. Minnesota is a run heavy team, but IMO Thielin is equally valuable, if not more than Boyd.) Another thing is how involved do you want to get with these 2 guys trades. You are basically mediating the deal. Are you going to do this for all future bad/egregious deals? Hopefully there‚Äôs not another one but do you still veto it then?"
1723,2020-03-25 19:34:16,fos694,"That compromise is so ridiculous.  Why take such a strong action of vetoing it if you'll allow such an equally bad trade?  

Even taking out the picks involved, you've got to just educate the new owner on why he's getting fleeced.  It should be their decision to do anything going forward, and their decision should be ""I'm not trading,"" lol."
1724,2020-03-25 19:53:19,fos694,"The ‚Äúrevised trade‚Äù is even worse. I‚Äôd veto this, tell the new owner to do his homework before trading again, and that he won‚Äôt get another do-over"
1725,2020-03-25 20:53:42,fos694,"Don‚Äôt veto anything ever outside of obvious collusion. Every owner gets to run their own franchise as they see fit. If they both thought it was fair (and the trade obviously isn‚Äôt collusion), then the trade is fair. 

Also, the repaired trade is just as bad as the other and it‚Äôs completely subjective if Boyd>Thielen or the reverse. 

Just like it‚Äôs similarly subjective that Howard will/won‚Äôt be an RB1 this year

Heck, if Howard gets 1,000 yards and 9 TDs, Thielen looks like the star he has shown flashes of over the past two years, MT is hurt this year and Brees retires end of season... all of the sudden the trade seems lopsided in the other direction."
1726,2020-03-25 21:28:07,fos694,"The more egregious thing is replacing Boyd for Thielen and thinking that‚Äôs better. Not to mention the 5th being gone.

Best solution would be Thielen and Howard for MT no picks. Maybe even throw Boyd in with Thielen package. MT side still is my pick but that‚Äôs probably the solution if you wanna go through with it."
1727,2020-03-25 15:45:45,fos694,"Let it stand. There was no apparent collusion. It might be bad valuation, it might be bad ""shopping technique"". Veto is not appropriate."
1728,2020-03-25 15:29:18,fos694,You should have let it ride. It‚Äôs not a good trade but it‚Äôs not egregious or anything. Buyer‚Äôs remorse and league whining are not reasons to overturn a trade.
1729,2020-03-25 16:38:51,fos694,"You said it yourself, and you're looking for validation when you know you didn't do the right thing.  You don't veto unless there's collusion.  There was no collusion here.  So no veto.

Simple.

1731,2020-03-25 15:49:47,fos694,I would have let the trade stand.
1732,2020-03-25 15:35:28,fos694,"I probably would‚Äôve let it stand.  It‚Äôs not so unbalanced as to give grounds for collusion because he‚Äôs adding some depth (especially if he‚Äôs hurting at RB) for some elite tier production in one position.  Not saying it‚Äôs balanced, just not beyond the pale.  

If I was owner 2 and I won that trade with the new owner I would be livid.  The feeling of getting someone like MT on the cheap in fantasy is one of the greatest feelings and he had that robbed from him after the fact.  

If I were one of the other owners I‚Äôd be upset that the guy didn‚Äôt publicize that he was trading MT, but not to the point where I‚Äôd want it undone.  If they really wanted MT they should‚Äôve been making offers.  Otherwise it‚Äôs not their business.  They‚Äôre just jealous.  And once again, I would be too.  I wouldn‚Äôt try to take away the trade from the owner who won though.

Because he‚Äôs new and it was his first trade I could see your side of things.  I‚Äôm just saying I would not have done it."

Btw, Thomas owner had no obligation to ""shop him around"". Owners that complain that he did not should be more active, stop waiting for a trade offer to fall onto their lap. It's their fault for not being proactive. Lesson learned for them also.

IMO."

1737,2020-03-25 17:32:58,fos694,You need to add a clause in your bylaws for vetoing that includes trades that change the integrity of the league. That‚Äôs best solution here to protect league and newbies
1738,2020-03-25 17:48:25,fos694,"I'm strongly opposed to vetoes. My argument has always been that if there is a reasonable chance for either side to win then a trade should be allowed.

That being said, there is no way to justify this. He's trading last year's WR1 for 2 aging pieces (Howard isn't even good, thielen is decent) AND he's giving up a higher pick? It just doesn't make sense. Combine that with the fact that he didn't shop MT around (he obviously would've gotten a better deal.) There's no conceivable universe where he wins this trade unless MT dies or has a career ending injury.

This is absolutely a reasonable place to veto. I wouldn't even do a makeup deal. Let owner B be unhappy. He knew that this was way out of bounds.

The problem with vetoing is when people start acting like people on this sub and assume the popular opinion is 100% correct. If you traded david Montgomery for waller and a 2020 2nd last spring some people would've wanted to veto. But smart owners were clued into the waller hype early and lots of people were concerned with Monty's speed and efficiency (I sure was) and you would've won that trade (imo)

But trading one of the top dynasty pieces for 2 old guys who are near the end of their careers? And ge gives up the higher draft pick? Even if it isn't, it gives off the appearance of collusion.

I say veto. Good luck."

1772,2020-03-25 22:58:41,fos694,Nah you veto it for league balance.  Berate the new owner and assess if its a fit.  Take the blame as the LM and bringing the guy in
1773,2020-03-25 16:21:31,fos694,"**Update:**

I'm working with the owners on a revised version of the trade as a means of compromise: 

Thomas + Everett for Tyler Boyd + Jordan Howard. 

Still a below market deal for Thomas, but a little less egregious, and in line with the previous league rules of not vetoing a trade. Appreciate the feedback from everyone, except the people who said to kick out the new owner! Y'all are cruel!"
1774,2020-03-25 16:58:36,fos694,"Should not be vetoed.  Something I do in my redraft keeper league in a situation where some request a undoing of a trade is I allow the other party in the trade to agree to a reverse. If they dont reverse it stands but I try and communicate to the other owner good leagues last when leaguemates are civil. 

I also only allow one reverse a year and I state all trades moving forward stand."
1775,2020-03-25 16:57:42,fos694,"Thomas has a year or two left with Brees at most

Thielen is going to get a bunch more targets. Jordan Howard is now going to get a bunch more touches.

It‚Äôs an awful trade but I‚Äôve seen worse, let it stand."
1776,2020-03-25 19:10:27,fos694,It should really be Boyd + Thielen + Howard for MT...
1777,2020-03-25 17:52:07,fos694,"Yea I don‚Äôt get that either, Thielen seems like the clear choice between the two to me."
1778,2020-03-25 18:32:15,fos694,Boyd should be added on top of Theilin and then it doesn't feel as bad.
1779,2020-03-25 18:33:11,fos694,I thought I was missing something. Thielen has been Rock solid for years.
1780,2020-03-25 18:10:08,fos694,"He's not.

Either trade needs to drop that 2nd and add a 1st to the other side for it to be remotely even."
1781,2020-03-25 20:00:26,fos694,100% agree with this. I would rather have Thielen.
1782,2020-03-25 21:43:32,fos694,Is commish team B!?
1783,2020-03-25 20:13:42,fos694,Yeah that‚Äôs a bad substitution.
1784,2020-03-26 03:17:02,fos694,You're missing the 2nd he dropped. But he should've just kept Thielen in and dropped the second
1785,2020-03-25 20:28:01,fos694,Boyd and thielen are probably equal in value
1786,2020-03-25 16:59:00,fos694,[deleted]
1787,2020-03-25 16:58:54,fos694,"Especially when it was his first deal and he wanted to undo it. Unless it's a high money league or super competitive for some other reason just let the guy have MT back. Like you say, everyone should be happy about that other than maybe the owner who got MT but even he should have some level of interest in keeping trading within a realm that is at least somewhat fair."
1788,2020-03-25 17:57:32,fos694,"I agree with you 100%. I would assume team B offered the the trade, and that they were, and did, take advantage of a new owner. Now they're mad not to have gotten away with it."
1789,2020-03-25 18:55:53,fos694,Agreed. Unbalanced trades happen. Unbalanced trades that destroy league integrity should be vetoed.

1791,2020-03-25 20:14:37,fos694,"I wish our commissioner had this mindset when we had a guy trade away Zeek for Tevin Coleman & Kelvin Benjamin...

It‚Äôs completely ruined the balance in our league"
1792,2020-03-25 21:50:39,fos694,"Yeah I learned the hard way on this with what's weirdly a similar trade.  We had a new player who sent Michael Thomas and two 1sts for Jordan Howard and two 2nds (this was right after Howard's breakout season so he was much higher value than now, but it was still awful).  I didn't veto it and have regretted it since.  It was back breaking for the new player and pushed the other team from a bottom feeder to the title game.  

I've since realized that new players should be protected more until they have time to figure out values."
1793,2020-03-25 17:04:40,fos694,I tend to agree.. but dam that's bad
1794,2020-03-25 20:49:42,fos694,Dude who gave up MT won't be setting his lineups 8 weeks in. Won't answer trade offers. Guaranteed.
1795,2020-03-25 17:25:24,fos694,"Exactly.  The answer is in the post IMO.  The owner ""realized he had fucked up.""  The end.  No collusion, no malice, no intent to subvert the values of players in the league, etc.  He just made a bad trade.  And the owners that are whining about it, well, maybe you should have inquired about MT before the other guy did?  

Vetoing trades is a bad precedent to set and it opens a door that will never, ever shut.  To me, the trade should stand, the end.  Dude made a terrible deal, but it was not collusion."
1796,2020-03-25 18:08:13,fos694,"The issue is less that someone is bad and gets punished, and more that one owner benefits disproportionately from the bad decision.  I agree about 80% with you, but I think the argument against is that it creates a competitive disadvantage.  There's also the knock-on consideration of league-wide low-balling."
1797,2020-03-25 22:11:31,fos694,"> People should be allowed to be bad at this.

*Bill O'Brien has entered the chat*"
1798,2020-03-25 17:46:20,fos694,"The second is what is truly baffling. MT is obviously worth more than all those assets combined, but I could see a relatively ignorant owner who didn‚Äôt pay attention to age, situation and MT‚Äôs league shattering season last year being fooled into thinking MT for Theilen and Howard made sense. Everett is a nothing throw in to me, but tacking on a second...I‚Äôd love to see the transcripts of the other owner‚Äôs sales pitch."
1799,2020-03-25 19:00:41,fos694,"Guessing Owner B took advantage of the new owner and made the trade proposal, rather than Owner A saying he'd throw on a 2nd to make it work. Commish made the right call."
1800,2020-03-25 16:15:41,fos694,"> I say veto. (ready for the downvotes) That is utter garbage. We just had Sutton for Thielen in my league which I thought was terrible (not vetoable, just terrible). Michael Thomas though???

Ya, this is his first dynasty league."
1801,2020-03-25 16:53:11,fos694,">the new owner doesn‚Äôt fully understand how to value players in regards to dynasty versus redraft 

What's confusing to me is that this trade would be terrible in redraft, too."
1802,2020-03-25 16:18:29,fos694,Appreciate this perspective - I'm gonna try to work with the owners on a revised version of the deal.
1803,2020-03-25 16:18:24,fos694,"This is the best answer. As a commissioner that has had to enforce harsh penalties, bylaws help separate you from the enforcement.

""It's not me that's punishing you, the bylaws are punishing you."""
1804,2020-03-25 15:47:38,fos694,What are some good bylaws to abide too?
1805,2020-03-25 16:26:25,fos694,"Ya, our league has bylaws and the trades section is very clear about no veto unless it's collusion. I recognize now that I acted too quickly last night and am now working with the owners on a revised version of the deal."
1806,2020-03-25 16:14:42,fos694,"Ya, I recognize the hypocrisy and all these responses have helped me realize that I acted too quickly. I'm working with the owners now to make a slightly tweaked version of the trade."
1807,2020-03-25 18:26:53,fos694,This needs more upvotes because you're right.  Having the other owners decide values and then all agree on a trade is absolutely not an option.
1808,2020-03-26 05:17:59,fos694,Exactly. I‚Äôd bet the owner did t regret the trade until AFTER all the dickheads started harassing him about it. Doesn‚Äôt sound like a fun league to me lol.
1809,2020-03-25 18:05:01,fos694,"The revised trade was based on owner A‚Äôs preference for Boyd, and also no longer includes the 2nd round pick (2.04) being sent away. He acknowledged that he hadn‚Äôt fully considered the dynasty ramifications of the deal and thus was much happier with acquiring Boyd as his team is not likely to compete this season"
1810,2020-03-25 16:13:50,fos694,But that's not the point. Nobody here is saying it was a good or even fair trade. But a commissioner using veto powers that loosely sets a dangerous precedent. I would be surprised if this league stays together after that.
1811,2020-04-14 23:18:21,fos694,"Be honest, you've made plenty of worse calls yourself."
1812,2020-03-25 16:55:44,fos694,">You can make the argument for both sides

Lmfao I'd love to hear the argument for Thielen and Jordan Howard over Michael Thomas."
1813,2020-03-25 22:52:09,fos694,"I thought the same thing! The trade is horrible enough, but asking for a 2nd round pick with it means your a real piece of work"
1814,2020-03-25 16:38:41,fos694,"Uhh, honestly the Thielen trade was better, IMO.

Edit: [Dynasty Trade Calculator](https://apps.dynastyprocess.com/calculator/) agrees with me, but both are way out of whack. Even Thomas + Everett for Thielen + Boyd + Howard is still pretty lopsided in favor of the Thomas side."
1815,2020-03-25 16:48:27,fos694,"Ugh, man you shouldn‚Äôt be doing anything. Your job is to make sure nobody is cheating. And to vett new owners before they join the league. Once they have paid their dues it‚Äôs their team to run as they like. You‚Äôve opened a shitty Pandora‚Äôs box with the way you are handling this. Now every trade will expect the same direct commish involvement."
1816,2020-03-25 21:17:19,fos694,This is my vote
1817,2020-03-25 20:29:32,fos694,this is actually much close to correct. MT is like a top 3 dynasty asset lol
1818,2020-03-25 20:32:28,fos694,"I don't know if I would agree with that. 

Green is the #1 target and while Burrow could be a really good QB being a rookie on a likely still sub par team could be tough to produce points to 2 WR's + Mixon will get passing work.  While Theilen will be MN WR #1 for the next 3 years"
1819,2020-03-25 17:02:12,fos694,"If there had been a 1st round pick in there, even a mid-late 1st, I would have called it a really bad trade, but wouldn't call it veto worthy.

But as it stands? Hell no."
1820,2020-03-25 20:46:24,fos694,"The tough part is that consensus can be wrong.

If that owner truly values Adam Thielen more highly than Michael Thomas, you have to let them make that trade, imo."
1821,2020-03-25 18:08:38,fos694,"99% of the time I agree with this. But this is a 7-year league and the new guy joined this offseason with no experience. In sounds a lot like a vet taking advantage of someone new. There just is very little reason to be making trades right now anyways since we‚Äôre still a ways out from the actual NFL draft.

I have been playing dynasty for ten years and have never vetoed a trade, but I‚Äôd veto this one. Having a new guy immediately get taken advantage of and have it destroy his team is just not good for the health of the league."
1822,2020-03-25 18:04:48,fos694,And allowing bad trades also sets a bad precedent--fleece the fish or be doomed to fall behind your less ethically sound league mates
1823,2020-03-25 21:52:21,fos694,"I personally feel like that if an owner realizes he screwed himself before the trade has been finalized *and* a majority of owners want a veto, a veto should be allowed. A majority of other owners shouldn‚Äôt be able to veto, but if the owner also wants to undo it, that‚Äôs where I‚Äôd draw the line."
1824,2020-03-25 18:57:34,fos694,Yes but that happens in a bad trade. I‚Äôd say the bigger issue is actually that a longtime owner decided to prey on the new guy and that‚Äôs not the kind of behavior you want in a longtime league like this.
1825,2020-03-25 18:50:23,fos694,"I'm normally on the side of ""no vetoes unless it is collusion,"" but I now see that there needs to be some kind of exception for new owners.  You can't have the league balance thrown way out of whack because one guy was the quickest to scam a new owner that doesn't know any better."
1826,2020-03-26 05:14:04,fos694,What side is it terrible for? Is it that obvious one will be THAT much better than the other? Just curious on your opinion here.
1827,2020-03-25 19:38:31,fos694,"One creative strategy I think would be to add in a ""compensitory pick""...like how NFL teams can get a 3rd rounder thats slotted in at the end of round 3 but before round 4. Its basically an asset that the league can provide and only damage the other teams by knocking them down one slot. Team A gets a handout and feels good, nothing gets taken from Team B and the other 12 members compromise one slot to keep A and B happy"
1828,2020-03-25 15:58:24,fos694,"Do a search online and there are some good ones in the thread and in here, but it‚Äôs important to know that you are the commissioner and it‚Äôs up to you, you have the final say. Some things should be voted on by polls and some things need executive decisions but know this event will create a rift going forward and like you said someone will be pissed off no matter what you do. 

In just dynasty league (not commish) all trades stand unless their is obvious or known collusion, which can be subjective. Because this is an off-season trade with a new owner, not likely. Give the new owner value charts and info on trade calculators, have them reach out with trades, offers for advice when getting started, etc. 

Keep communication and happenings clear, keep owners informed. Appoint a co-commissioner to help with bylaws If you can, but this is the whole purpose going forward to avoid situations like this. 

Don‚Äôt be surprised if some teams drop out after this. Have some back up owners ready to go on standby, typically change is hard to deal with and usually knocks an owner or two out. 

Again, trade should stand. Because the owner is pissed that they let the best WR in the game go for peanuts is their problem. This is how you learn dynasty values and you have to deal with losses, it won‚Äôt be the first bad trade a new owner makes, it happens."

1830,2020-03-25 17:26:06,fos694,You should not be revising or even involving yourself in this.  The trade should stand.  There is no collusion.
1831,2020-03-25 17:00:00,fos694,You shouldn‚Äôt been involved at this point. You admittedly vetoed too quickly and now you‚Äôre making B pay the price. You should enforce the previous trade. Intervening even little bit at this point destroys your integrity.
1832,2020-03-25 18:12:51,fos694,"What I don‚Äôt understand tho is that this is a trade even my grandma would know not to make. Whether this guy has been playing redraft for 20 years makes no difference. MT put up almost 300 last year and is 27. Adam put up almost 100 and is 29. Even just looking at their player cards or a quick google makes you realize this is a shit deal. Then he has to throw in a 2nd rounder? 

I want to see the trade negotiations lol, and want to hear the new guys justification for the deal. If I was commish I leave it. There no way anyone who has watched football wants to make this deal, and anyone who goolges the players won‚Äôt make the deal. What are the dynasty ramifications? This is shit in dynasty or redraft. Leave it."
1833,2020-03-25 16:24:05,fos694,"It‚Äôs not loosely. The new owner is obviously naive at dynasty football, and another owner took advantage.. a one time veto, and coaching/teaching the newbie not to be an idiot is by far the best long term option for a league of friends"
1834,2020-03-25 16:51:46,fos694,"No, the precedent set for this league is 7 years of no vetoed trades. This is just making the right decision in an unusual circumstance."

Feel bad for that little freak though. He still follows me around, whining, even after all this time. He actually searches for me on whatever social sites he has, like he still follows me for some reason. It's stage. He should just man up and get over it. But unlikely. Sad."
1836,2020-03-25 17:32:26,fos694,"My thoughts exactly. It‚Äôs gonna depend a lot on how Burrow looks, but given the knowns it‚Äôs definitely not better."
1837,2020-03-25 23:17:33,fos694,How can you say AJ Green is the #1 target when the last time he played a full game was week 8 2018? He‚Äôs coming off a year and a half worth of rust plus an ACL injury for a 31 yo WR. He‚Äôs unlikely to play the whole 2020 season let alone be the #1 WR
1838,2020-03-25 20:43:58,fos694,"Giving up extra draft compensation on top of the bad player swap is my biggest issue with it. 

Even if the 5th and 2nd switch sides of the trade it would flip my opinion from veto-worthy to really bad."
1839,2020-03-26 05:06:11,fos694,"Exactly. Not to mention if Thomas gets hurt and theilen has 1300 yards, in hindsight it won‚Äôt be bad and the leagues opinion on Thomas will completely change. Gotta let ppl make their own decisions. Michael Thomas switching teams surely won‚Äôt RUIN a league."
1840,2020-03-25 18:17:10,fos694,"Reading OPs post I thought the veto was a bit BS but reading your comment makes me change my mind. I wouldnt want my whole league getting screwed up (team B is a power house now unfairly and team A is a scrub probably) just because the new guy is a fool. 

But if owner A is going to make this kind of a trade it sounds like the league might be screwed. Its funny how one guy can really jack stuff up if he doesnt know what hes doing."
1841,2020-03-26 05:08:47,fos694,"If they‚Äôre that serious then don‚Äôt invite someone that experienced in. If he‚Äôs that bad, this will be an issue all year long. I guarantee he only regretted it after ppl started calling him an idiot."
1842,2020-03-25 18:21:49,fos694,"You make a sound point and I don't completely disagree with you on its surface, but I think there's more to it than that.  The league is only as strong as its agreed-upon bylaws and the Commish's role in enforcing those bylaws.  If you have a league where the situation determines the Commissioner response, you're traveling down a path with no end.  All trades could be argued one way or another, all trades will affect one or more owners in their division, or conference, or next up on their schedule, etc.  Once you go down the path of ""not good for the health of the league,"" you're in a rabbit hole.  

I've been a Commish since 1993.  Seriously.  I'm an old guy who posts 'round these parts every once in a while.  And in my years I've learned the HARD WAY that you just can't veto this trade.  Years ago we had a guy trade for the R1.1 (Reggie Bush) for a bucket of marbles.  I don't remember the specifics, but it was bad.  Coaches were upset, people were threatening to quit, etc.  And my response was simply: ""Do we want a league where we as a group decide trades or do we want a league where we all sign off on bylaws and live with them, no matter what?""  

And in the end, 100% of them agreed on the latter.  And it's for all those reasons I described.  I completely get what you're saying, but once you veto a trade for any reason OUTSIDE of the bylaws, you are faced with an endless stream of objections and outrage from...someone.  That's my two cents, but I respect yours as well.

Edit: Guess some dudes didn't get the memo that the downvote arrow is not a disagree button.  Oh well."
1843,2020-03-25 18:17:06,fos694,"What's a worse precedent?  Having a league abide by its own bylaws or having a league change the bylaws at any time by situation?  I'd argue the latter, personally."
1844,2020-03-26 13:30:24,fos694,"MT is 2 years younger and much better than Thielen.  A depth RB to massively upgrade at WR, and move up 3 rounds in the draft?"
1845,2020-03-25 17:25:48,fos694,"‚ÄúGive the new owner value charts and info on trade calculators, have them reach out with trades, offers for advice when getting started‚Äù.

This is my favorite piece of advice (so far). It‚Äôs great to get new owners who are anxious to help their teams out and want to make moves....however, far to often when a new owner comes in the veterans of the league look to take absolute advantage of owners who are new to the league (or naive about fantasy in general) .

My baseball dynasty league has a ‚Äútrade committee‚Äù where new owners have to have their trades pre-approved before they can be submitted to the commish. This lasts their entire first year. It allows
The new owner to ‚Äúget their feet wet‚Äù while having full control of their
Teams (just a delay in outcomes). The new owners we‚Äôve brought in
Are given that learning curve and they end up making just a few 
‚ÄúBad trades‚Äù that need revision , and they end up not making the
Kind of dynasty destroying moves that can set a franchise back years.
Which then means they are more likely to stick around in the future
And your league isn‚Äôt put into a cycle of constantly looking to find an
Owner willing to pick up a shell of a franchise that needs 7 years to 
Be competitive.  

This committee is comprised of the longest standing member and co-commish, along with 2 well respected owners (based on their character not how well they‚Äôve done in the league) and that‚Äôs really been a game changer for us. It‚Äôs forced the entire league to reflect as to whether or not seeking out super lopsided trades (as this one most certainly is) is worth possible destruction of the league. 
In the 14 years since it‚Äôs been implemented the # of trades new owners got raped on dropped to zero.
I‚Äôd highly recommend doing something similar in any league that‚Äôs had this issue."
1846,2020-03-25 17:08:26,fos694,"And what if owner A decides to quit? 

Now no one would take ownership of the orphan due to a disaster of a trade.

It could be league ruining"
1847,2020-03-25 18:39:50,fos694,"Naivety shouldn‚Äôt justify a veto. He didn‚Äôt have to accept anything. He could have asked for help, used calculators, etc. or the commissioner could have recruited an experienced dynasty owner.

1849,2020-03-25 18:21:53,fos694,"Your second paragraph is right on. Hopefully this is a lesson learned for Team A. I know it can sometimes be hard to find replacements, but there are few things more detrimental to the long term success of the league than someone who doesn‚Äôt know what they are doing."
1850,2020-03-25 18:43:54,fos694,"Your points are certainly valid. It‚Äôs a tough situation, and adhering strictly with the Bylaws is understandable and is always my view wherever possible. But, no set of Bylaws is perfect and we cannot always envision every situation, no matter how careful we are. 

Like I said in my post above, I‚Äôve never voted to veto a trade and neither has our league. We have had our share of bad trades, some of which are *worse* than the one above. Actually, much worse. People grumbled behind scenes, but no action or veto was taken. We didn‚Äôt even ask for the sides to justify the trades. We all trust each other, we‚Äôre all vets, and we‚Äôve all been playing together for a long time. There will be bad trades. There will be fair trades. There will be trades that look bad and actually turn out fair, or turn out good for the team that was originally thought to be on the bad side. That‚Äôs the fun part of dynasty, and giving teams the autonomy to take those risks is vital.

But, and this is the big one for me, it‚Äôs a new guy and it‚Äôs the off-season. Maybe he‚Äôs had experience in other dynasty leagues, in which case I wouldn‚Äôt veto the trade, but if this is a guy who joined the league with no experience and just doesn‚Äôt have a good grasp on dynasty valuations, or doesn‚Äôt know about the ordinary tools we all use for evaluating, then I‚Äôm likely voting in favor of veto. It also depends on what kind of league it is. Is it for money? Are the people friends? There are some nuances that would make me change my mind.

I‚Äôve been in various dynasty leagues over the years, and at the end of the day it‚Äôs the people in them that determine whether it‚Äôll be successful or not. I‚Äôve been in leagues where everyone is knowledgeable, but people bicker about everything. Those aren‚Äôt enjoyable for me and, in my experience, they tend to not last. My most successful league, the 10-year one I referenced, has reasonable people who get along and trust each other. We adhere to the Bylaws wherever possible, and we make judgment calls from time to time wherever necessary.

If this were put to a vote in my league, I don‚Äôt know what would happen. I can see merit to both sides, and the circumstances are of course important and we don‚Äôt have all the facts. But I‚Äôd veto. That‚Äôs just me. If it didn‚Äôt get vetoed, I‚Äôd live and move on."
1851,2020-03-26 05:11:01,fos694,"Couldn‚Äôt have been said better. If all leagues followed this idea, all leagues would run fairly smooth."
1852,2020-03-25 18:21:50,fos694,Yeah I'm assuming this specific situation is not covered by league bylaws. But my larger point is that trade veto only for collusion is not strong enough and most leagues should allow for unbalanced trade vetoes as well.

1855,2020-03-25 18:47:27,fos694,Im playing in a 12 man dynasty league with a few guys I dont know very well. Last year was the first year for the league and one guy picked Nick Foles in the first round... fuck! This wasnt a panic move by any means either because each pick has 4 hours to make their decision (the draft took 2.5 weeks). We quickly found out it was a huge mistake to let this guy in the league. He finished dead last (surprise) and there were weeks he didnt even set his lineup. Thankfully we kicked him out for this year.
1856,2020-03-25 19:14:03,fos694,"We sound like two fellas cut from the same cloth.  I don't disagree with any of this, I just reach a different conclusion at the end of it.

You are clearly missing the point. It will be hard to *find a new player* if the team is completely butchered. That is what the commish is trying to prevent.

1859,2020-03-25 19:39:00,fos694,"That makes it less reasonable to veto. If it‚Äôs just a group of friends and there‚Äôs not a lot at stake, why‚Äôs everyone making a big deal over a lopsided trade? Just give the guy shit and move on."

1861,2020-03-25 18:32:54,fos694,Yea the league might have to subsidize the team to bring someone in to manage it at least for a year or two.

1865,2020-03-24 15:00:09,fo6dwl,"Feels like more. Back when theaters were opened, I had inadvertantly started a Black Movie Sunday. It happend after I saw *Just Mercy*, *Slim* and *Bad Boys for Life* on consecutive Sundays so it certainly seems like African-Americans have more box office representation than ever before."
1866,2020-03-24 15:28:00,fo6dwl,"There are more because more opportunities for African American directors and writers to their thing. Also because of this, there are more roles for African-American actors and actresses compared to like 25-30 years ago. Also on that it is becoming more mainstream because times have changed for the better"
1867,2020-03-24 19:13:23,fo6dwl,"I don't care about the race/ethnicity of the actors.

But a common theme I saw in most old black-majority films was blaxsploitation,  reinforcing stereotypes either in a negative or comedic light (but not like good comedy, but like overused momma/fat/blonde jokes), or a focus on racism or slavery. And if not that, it was some Lifetime movie-like family/faith drama.

Like, you can only enjoy so many films like that. Similar issues in LGBT films - so many end, even in these times, bittersweet or tragic. Why the hell can't we have HAPPY LGBT films? Where's our Zack Effron/Zandaya forbidden-love-ends-happy gay couple? 

That's why films like *Black Panther,* *Creed,* and *Us* are great. Even *Get Out*, which does play on our experiences with race/racism, isn't doing so in the same way as Blaxploitation films in the past. It doesn't, like, *glorify* being the downtrodden race, if that makes sense. Like there's something ""good"" about being the victims. 

So the key for any under-represented (or badly represented) demographic to making films that are more relatable and appealing to the masses is to just make the films that present the obstacles and challenges the characters face as something not entirely unique to their own race/ethnicity/sexuality. Like if say, *The Devil Wears Prada* was led by a Black woman. You can bring up systemic racism in the fashion world as something Black-Andy has to navigate and overcome just as White-Andy had to navigate and overcome systemic sexism at certain points, but if every single challenge she faced *was* about racism, that would be just as tedious as White-Andy having to tackle sexism in every single challenge. Did Tyrion Lannister encounter problems related to being a dwarf? Yes. Were ALL his problems and relatable issues related to being a dwarf? No."

1869,2020-03-24 15:27:23,fo6dwl,"I think it has more to do with the changing of the gatekeepers. If some talented young actors in the 1950s were black, there weren't films being greenlit that they could star in. 

Over the last 30 years the people who greenlight films have become Gen X and Millennials. They saw no reason to gatekeep filmmaking to prevent black, LGBTQ, women and any other underrepresented groups from being part of the industry. 

This goes for much art: video games, TV, books, stage acting, etc. The actors and stories have always been there. They just haven't been allowed to be produced until recently."
1870,2020-03-24 15:38:59,fo6dwl,"And more importantly, stories *generated* from those *within* the community are, naturally, more relatable. When filmmakers like Jordan Peele, Barry Jenkins, Ava DuVernay, Ryan Coogler, and Dee Rees write their stories, they resonate with us because they are us.

And this isn't just happening within black cinema. I'd argue that films like Burning, The Farewell, Crazy Rich Asians, and this year's Sundance grand jury winner Minari are reflective of how stories from Asian perspectives can resonate.

Parasite winning Best Picture's a testament to the strengths of writing what you know. Moonlight winning two years prior was another."

1872,2020-03-24 15:50:17,fo6dwl,"Yes even Knives Out is a predominately white movie which is on reason why it was successful. It was built on a community aspect. I think there's two kinds of thinking with diversity. The majority of places in the world have one or two races as a majority. But then you have kind of coastal port places like New York and California that is built on immigrating as many people as possible and take all the cast offs. You can see the massive difference between how people view diversity based on community vs individual character tokenism. It all depends on if people support the coastal tokenism diversity or the other parts of the country diversity where it's more homegrown.

I have a hard time not seeing a writer or casting agent in my head when I see a cast where every single person is a different background. That rings so false to me. there is almost always a majority of someone, and that's good. It means we have diversity in the world that we can explore

Like I'll give an example of a horrible use of diversity. The new Beauty and the Beast. The whole point of the town is that it is so small that Belle has to sing about how small it is. Yet these people that apparently are so bigoted have black librarians and interracial marriages and all this stuff and even allow women to be in mobs.

Hmmm.....

Ahh, so this is some sort of *coastal* agenda, which isn't reflective of the *true*... *homegrown*... ""diversity""... which is...

You seem to suffer from a certain... binary, dogmatic, fundamentalist mode of thought, which you are then applying to artistic interpretation. I think that's why you have the most outlandish perspective.


But I think I see your greater racial arguments in regards to diversity (it's hard looking at minorities right?). I certainly know where they're coming from... spectrum-wise. I think, overall, you've got a pretty reductive take on things, but you at least *sound* better than most of the people who incessantly bitch about diversity in film.

Also, you should watch Knives Out again as a commentary on people who make similar arguments as you. There's actually literally a scene in the film of people lampooning your ideology. It's so funny actually... the irony of it... that you saw Knives Out as a predominantly white film, when it's like... super critical of the white race. That's... damn I love art."
1875,2020-03-24 16:55:11,fo6dwl,"I'm a minority I see minorities everyday in the mirror bro. And I'm agreeing with you. Stories about communities are more real than Hollywood plopping every demographic, focus tested character groups together to cover as wide a net as possible.

Knives out was a critique of white people, which is fine. But like if the entire family was multiracial the whole movie would lose its message. Nobody hates white people more than other white people. It's funny to watch from the outside to me. It's similar to Parasite, or Black Panther. If you're going to make a movie about a subject you have to cast the right people for it.

>You seem to suffer from a certain... binary, dogmatic, fundamentalist mode of thought, which you are then applying to artistic interpretation. I think that's why you have the most outlandish perspective.

1877,2020-03-24 17:38:38,fo6dwl,"> But like if the entire family was multiracial the whole movie would lose its message. 

Sure, but... the white cast *was* the message. Since you're a minority, you'll remember the uproar at the Hamilton casting notes as they were looking for minorities like *ourselves* to play the main characters, save for King George, played brilliant by Jonathan Groff. There was so much anger and threats of boycotting from people who bristle at diversity, or see it as some cinematically illogical threat that rips them away from their precious art.

>I tried genuinely. I have no clue what this even means.

I've clearly made presumptions of you. My bad.

Good talk though... good ideas at play here."
1878,2020-03-24 18:51:33,fo6dwl,"I know nothing about Hamilton. I'm not a Broadway dude. Was King George the bad guy? If so I get the anger. But either way I genuinely don't know what the Broadway crowd likes and I know it's a success for them, good for them.

Yeah man you're good at talking about this stuff. Cheers."
1879,2020-03-24 19:10:52,fo6dwl,"Whether King George was a bad guy is up to one's perspective. He was a historical figure who, I assume, thought he was doing the right thing. Americans, however, might disagree if they value their freedom.

In the play though he's a riot! One of the most beloved characters in musicals ever, honestly. It's an incredible role that actors are dying to play, so they had no context for their anger, if that makes sense."

1918,2020-03-19 21:17:58,fldi4s,"I‚Äôll do a lineup of my own also:

**PG: 1990-91 Terry Porter $13** (very reliable and efficient playoff scorer, good defender, good passer. He had a short peak so seems to be generally undervalued but his peak is a perfect secondary player. He was arguably the best postseason scorer on Portland for a few years with Drexler. He was also statistically the best 3-point shooter in the 1990-91 season, along with Reggie Miller.)

**SG: 2002-03 Tracy McGrady $29** (one of the greatest scoring seasons ever at his peak. Also a very good passer with a low turnover rate for his load. Has proven that he can be a good defender with a lower load which will be given in this lineup.)

**SF: 2002-03 Doug Christie $4** (prototypical 3&D, along with good general efficiency and also very good passing. He shot over 40% and made the all-defensive team in the 2002-03 season, along with a high assist rate.)

**PF: 2003-04 Kevin Garnett $35** (one of the easiest stars to fit in any team, amazing defense, great passing, can provide spacing. He is the absolute perfect 2nd option to go along with Tracy McGrady in my opinion. His MVP campaign is also statistically one of the best seasons ever.)

**C: 1968-69 Nate Thurmond $6** (one of the top defensive peaks in NBA history. Not the most efficient but there was not much emphasis on efficiency back then, especially for a player in his role. I think scaled to today‚Äôs NBA he would be given smarter shots, especially with 3 very good scorers with him in the lineup.)

**BE: 1993-94 Nate McMillan $2** (one of the greatest guard defenders ever. Also a great passer that didn‚Äôt waste possessions. He also provided a decent 3-pointer in the 1993-94 season. Basically has everything you need out of a backup guard in a team with a bunch of scoring already.)

**BE: 2006-07 Joe Johnson $5** (this is the pick I am probably the least confident about but I need a bench scorer after electing to have all of these secondary players, and his 2006-07 campaign was a great scoring season where he averaged 25 PPG, shooting 50% from 2 and 38% from 3.

Dumars $9
Barry $15
Griffin $8
Chamberlain $32

Maravich $5
VanDeWeghe $2
Aldridge $4

This team is built to run and score the hell out of the ball. The backbone is Nash and Chamberlain, who would be an almost unfair SSOL matchup. Barry rounds out scoring alongside Chamberlain, with Griffin being capable of stretching the floor beside Wilt as well as performing secondary ballhandling as needed. Griffin would also be a killer lob threat here, as expected. Dumars rounds out the starting 5 with defense and shooting, plus is able to handle the ball beside Nash.

The bench were some of the best value pieces I could find, with the idea of stretching out the floor and letting Chamberlain feast inside. Maravich is absolutely absurd value at $5, and is going to be the world's best sixth man running the floor and jacking up shots. VanDeWegh is a nice complimentary piece, and once again pulls gravity out. Aldridge is good value as well, and would fit great as a pick and pop + general midrange threat, while also having a good post game inside.

Overall, the team is a bit weak on defense, but they would score so damn much that might not matter. I think this is about the best you can get for exactly $100."

Amar‚Äôe and Gasol are two great value bigs who can give great defense, boards and can stretch the floor decently well. Gasol and Jordan will anchor the defense both being a DPOY at some point in their career. The bench is filled with value pieces that cover some of our holes. For an ABSOLUTE steal of $5, Pistol Pete is very crafty offensively and can create for others as well as himself. He also provides some needed shooting off the bench. Parish is great for his size, rebounding and defense for a cheap cost. JT rounds out the team as a smooth scorer off the bench that bolsters our offense.

My starting lineup is a beefed up version of the 1996 Bulls. The offense runs the Jordan, unsurprisingly, but we'll need some shooters around him since this version of Jordan isn't as quite polished the perimeter shooter as Jordan from 93-98 was. His midrange is still excellent, but his driving ability and athleticism at this time makes him unstoppable when he has any semblance of open space. Hinrich is the perfect complimentary piece to Jordan. He takes the best qualities of Ron Harper and John Paxson, but with improved defense, grit, and leadership. Jordan, Pippen, and Rodman really speak for themselves. Marc Gasol is also an excellent piece for the triangle offense, where his playmaking and general basketball IQ will thrive. On the defensive end, this team is impenetrable. On the bench, I have insane scoring with Drazen Petrovic and Allan Houston. Houston was Klay Thompson before Klay Thompson. Petrovic is an insanely efficient, creative player who would be the ideal spark off the bench. Bam Adebayo, unbeknownst to many, was still a really, really damn good player last year. He'd make it so my team is defensively versatile, as his ability to switch is only matched by a select few players who are much more expensive than him.

The starting lineup is the exact players you'd want around a ball-dominant point forward like LeBron. Curry, the best off-ball player and shooter of all-time. Bowen, a knockdown corner shooter and excellent, versatile defender. Ron Artest, the crazy dude who brings an insane amount of hustle and tenacity to the team, locking down any other team's best player in the 2-4 positions. Bowen and Artest will be placed on the other team's best players in the 1-4 positions, allowing Curry and LeBron to focus more on team defense, where they excel. Curry is also able to mask his defensive deficiencies with this team, while also being surrounded by players who suit him offensively. And Tyson Chandler is the cerebral, communicative defender and lob threat who makes things easier for everyone. LeBron surrounded by these guys would be perfect for his game. On the bench, Rondo is there for when LeBron is not in the game, since this team is in desperate need of more ball handlers. Allan Houston I've already spoken about. Kendrick Perkins is the best defender and rebounder I could find for $1.

I‚Äôm shocked at the low rate MJ is being picked. That 10 hour doc can‚Äôt come soon enough. Oh well. Let‚Äôs start with 1988 Michael Jordan, the best season ever played by a basketball player. Elite defense, elite from the triple threat, elite clutchness. MVP AND DPOY, lol. 35/6/6 at 54% fg with FIVE stocks. No better value. 

Now I need 3 point shooting, the only average or below average aspect of His Highness. So I‚Äôm more than happy to have 50/40/90 club member 1993 Mark Price at $11. All-nba first team in a stacked league, and 3-point all-star champion. 

Pete Maravich at $5 to come off my bench is just comically undervalued. Shoot or pass, I‚Äôll put the 3 and D‚Äôs next to him and just give him the rock. Let‚Äôs open a bottle of 1977, scoring champ, all-star and 1st team, 68 against the Knicks and cocaine optional. 

Despite MJ, the other 2 don‚Äôt give me great confidence defensively, so let‚Äôs take care of this. Wings I go for 3 and D experts, if they can handle a bit that‚Äôs a plus. 

Enter, Hondo. At $11, his 1974 season might be the cheapest. Title, all-star, DPOY, 1st team, Finals MVP. Yes please

Also, can‚Äôt help but go with Elgin Baylor, maybe the all-time most underrated player. 38/19 in 1962 while in military reserve in Washington, easy money at $13. I‚Äôll finish it off with Gerald Wallace, a Swiss Army knife and defensive world beater, wasted his 5 stocks a game in 2006 on the lowly expansion bobcats. He‚Äôll be in the bottom of the rotation here and just unleashed for stretches. 

At the center position I‚Äôm going to go for a world- stopper to face other team‚Äôs studs, that can pass and facilitate to the studs I have around them. Between those 3 guards + Hondo and Baylor I got all the scoring I need. 

Gimme 2014 Joakim Noah. Top-5 MVP and DPOY at 5 bucks is great value. 85-87 Arvydas will give me all the punch inside I need, non NBA-GOAT. But I won‚Äôt cheat and will go with an NBA season, 1996.

1936,2020-03-19 21:26:53,fldi4s,"Alright so this took me a minute since I had to make sure the guys I chose really were good at what I thought they were and I wasn‚Äôt just misremembering something (Wes Unseld and his potential to extend his range in the modern era) but I think I got a very solid team that does everything well or well enough.

Starting Five:

Isiah Thomas $18

Joe Dumars $9

James Worthy $10

Dennis Rodman $9

Hakeem Olajuwon $37


Off the Bench:

Bob Cousy $2

Wes Unseld $4

Yao Ming $10

I‚Äôve got 2 playmakers in Cousy and Thomas but not only guys who can pass the ball, but also iso and score for themselves. 

There isn‚Äôt a bad defender on my team and not only that, everyone‚Äôs well above average at worst. There‚Äôs plenty of other teams that have one or two players that can score off of an iso and everyone else kind of spaces out (like mine). That won‚Äôt really work going against my team and it‚Äôs no coincidence that I got Thomas, Dumars, and Rodman back on the same team to deal with guys like Jordan for example. So I know for sure the perimeter isn‚Äôt a safe spot for teams but not only that I also have a wide range of size down low that I can move around depending on my opponents. Yao and Hakeem to match up against two other big body centers, Rodman and Unseld to stop small ball lineups in case anyone chooses to run a Barkley, Simmons, Magic, etc in their front court, or any other traditional 4 and 5 lineup I‚Äôll more likely run into. And I think Worthy, Dumars, Thomas, Unseld, and Rodman will do more than enough against an opposing fast break to make sure they can‚Äôt get anything out of our offensive lapses.

Rebounding on either side will not be an issue with our 4 back court players small or big.

Shooting may be our weakest area but I honestly believe that in the modern era, guys like Thomas, Yao, Cousy, Worthy, and Olajuwon would be more than capable of extending out and scoring from range. I won‚Äôt need anything crazy, just make sure that foot isn‚Äôt on the line and we‚Äôll be fine. 

Our offensive fast breaks with guys like Cousy, Thomas, and Worthy taking it down, and Olajuwon, Ming, and Unseld initiating them should also lead to some guaranteed buckets against slower paced teams.

I‚Äôve got my off-ball needs filled out with standstill shooters like Dumars, Cousy, and Yao (hopefully), my cutters in Worthy and Rodman, and my solid screeners in Olajuwon, Rodman, and Ming.

The most important thing I was going for with this team was Hakeem having his post touches and either scoring at will down low, or flipping our offense inside out and scoring with open looks from deep. His Rings are a testament to being able to run with competent non Allstars and creating something out of nothing in some occasions. This team is better than any of the teams he played with, no offense to the other guys, and he should be able to will them to a few wins on his own worst case scenario, especially with a certain lineup. Him against the opposing team‚Äôs PF and Yao at either the opposite low block or, hopefully, the corner with the other Center will for sure kill plenty of teams and should put Olajuwon‚Äôs score column in the double digits off of those plays alone.

Just a small thing to add at the end here, I‚Äôm also hoping for the added bonus of chemistry, lack of ego, and personality fit to benefit us. I can‚Äôt say for certain about guys like Worthy, Cousy, and Unseld but I know for sure that the rest of the guys won‚Äôt demand anything outside of what‚Äôs needed to win the game. A guy like Wilt would‚Äôve been amazing on this team too but I just always had a feeling he had a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting mine‚Äù attitude that would rub some guys the wrong way, or a Kobe who might make some of his teammates great and push them really far, but also might push other guys out (not that he would in this lineup but that could be an issue in other groups). You‚Äôll have the ‚Äúin your face guys‚Äù like Rodman and Thomas to go toe to toe with other big mouths from other teams, while also having guys like Ming, Dumars, and Olajuwon to keep the team leveled and steady, talent wise and personality wise."

I thought about then finding some $2 players, but there are enough dollar menu guys that the decision quickly became who do I choose to splurge $5 on as the elite third option. The two standouts are Pete Maravich and Artis Gilmore. I was tempted to get the big guy, but the dollar menu is full of other big talent, so I decided to go with Pistol Pete to add another elite scorer and playmaker.

The dollar menu talent I chose to fill out the remaining five spots are:

1. Trae Young
2. Clyde Lovellette
3. Harry Gallatin
4. Maurice Stokes
5. Alex Groza

Trae gives me the greatest bargain shooter available that also brings elite passing ability

The remaining $4 gets me top notch scoring bigs in the form of 3 Hall of Famers, 8 All-NBA appearances, 16 All-Star Appearances, and total averages of 69ppg and 50rpg

Those dollar bigs can handle anything inside, with Lebron and MJ the elite wing defenders. Not that any defense is even needed, as I've got the most potent offensive firepower imaginable, with 2 GOATs to hit game-winners in case any team even comes close at the end of a game.

Rodman is here to defend and rebound, and he‚Äôs very good at that. Jokic turns my starting five into a playmaking sandwich. He can operate the offense in the post if Stockton or rondo aren‚Äôt and can easily find an open Middleton or cutting Klay.

My defense is excellent except for Lillard, and everyone can hit the 3 except for Simmons.

I am pretty happy with this line up, if anything I would have used the extra $8 on another body than a pricier player because all the pricier players I considered for each position were more than $8.

This is a pretty solid defensive team, gasol a stud, bosh can do well against guards and bigs, Durant always surprises me, and luka and Stockton hold their own (Stockton might not handle a 5 very well if he somehow got switched)

Stockton is a willing passer and can definitely facilitate and run a lethal PnR with anyone else on the team. If the team is stalling, Durant or luka can both do well with iso. Middleton and Beal can add great scoring off the bench.

Used all $100 and I think I made a pretty great team. Prime CP3 with prime KD is pretty much a dream teamup for me, as KD has shown he can thrive with a ball dominant guard, and one with much higher BBall IQ than Russ would surely help KD thrive even more. CP3 is an all time defensive player and KD has proven he can work very well in a team defensive scheme, even vying for DPOY for a brief time with the warriors.

For the SG spot I chose Hornacek, an amazing shooter that doesn't need the ball in his hands to thrive.
 He would provide spacing for the go to scorers and his underrated playmaking would be very useful when Paul sits. On defence he wasn't a world beater but he was serviceable for his position and his steal numbers paint the picture of a player able to effectively play passing lanes.

The PF and C spots were reserved for players who served a certain utility for the main stars. Odom was the ultimate 'do it all' guy throughout his career, and he would be asked to defend, rebound and occasionally playmake while Paul sits or during certain fastbreak sets. Thurmond was the ultimate rebounder and rim protector during his time, and would be the anchor of the defence. He would also act as the primary lob threat of the team, though his low career FG% would mean the ball would be kept out of his hands as much as possible.

I had a bit of trouble choosing my bench, but I settled on Brook as he showed last season his ability as a 3 and D threat, Pistol Pete as a Lou Will style off the bench ball handler, and Joakim Noah as another imposing defensive bigman for when Thurmond sits.

Rip Hamilton because I was short on budget and he's the best I could think of. Really good sub.  
Bill Laimbeer for Bill Laimbeer stuff and to tire and piss off the opposition bigs considering we're weak

1992,2020-03-21 17:31:31,fldi4s,"* $45 - Lebron James (2018). I really thought about having 2013 LeBron for his defense, but I want maestro LeBron. He's at his passing peak here. His post game at this point is very refined and I'm hoping that a lessened offensive burden will up his defensive effort.
* $35 - Kevin Durant (2018). Durant with the Warriors had much improved rim protection and learned how to play off-ball. He has great respect for LeBron but will still be unafraid to be the closer. I think their dynamic will work as the two superstars on the team.
* $8 - Ron Artest (2009). Will guard the best wing on the opposing team. Competent shooter and tough guy.
* $3 - Kristaps Porzingis (2018). LeBron likes a pick and pop partner. Versatile and solid shooter. Offers rim protection. Allows LeBron and Durant to play in the mid post with good spacing.
* $3 - Tyson Chandler (2011). Interior defense and rebounding. Also a great lob threat for my two elite passers, one of whom is...
* $2 - Luka Doncic (2019). I can't get 2020 Luka, but rookie Luka is still a solid shot creator. He's probably my sixth man, and will love running pick and roll with fellow Mav Chandler.
* $2 - Mike Bibby (2003). I need a shooting point guard who will play well off the ball. Has a bit of an edge as well and won't get jitters in the playoffs. Also a good free throw shooter if we need close out games.
* $2 - Marcus Smart (2019). My guard defender. Will play well in a switching scheme and has improved as a shooter. Can run pick and roll.

My starting lineup is Bibby, Artest, James, Durant, Porzingis. I am worried about who will chase people around screens in my starting lineup, so if there are two slippery guards, I might move Artest to the bench and bring in Smart. Doncic runs my second unit and might close games depending on if he is feeling it. I wish I had more automatic shooters, but I think with the space and perfect passing of James and Doncic, my shooters will be better than their percentages. Defensively I'm set for any matchup, between Smart, Artest, and Chandler. James will thrive in a freelancing role on defense."

Demar derozan-2

Total=98

I think my squadron would take any team to 7 games. Ton of IQ and a good sense of who plays what role. My only matchup concern is fisher just because he is pretty small but dude is a pitbull and plays good D, also you can‚Äôt leave him open beyond the arc so he gives the team good spacing. Iggy is the perfect glue to any team IMO. Can play good D 1-3 and can shoot the 3 ball. Also a great cutter and moves the ball well. I wanted a 4 that could stretch the floor, run well on fast breaks and pick up guards on pNr. Serge also has good interior D so hes a good addition to Hakeem. No need to explain Kobe and hakeem. Kobe is of course the #1 option. Hakeem is there to rebound, defend and score when kobes cold, so probably not often. 

My bench is my favorite part, i feel like these two were tooooo undervalued, but, understandably. Doncic can sub in 1-3 and comfortably run the offense, give kobe a break at the two and take on the scoring load or be the glue to the second unit the way iggy is to the first. Then i have derozan who can sub in 2-4. Derozan can do what doncic can do for the 2-3. I know he typically doesnt play 4 but with having DJ as my back up 5, we can play some small ball with the second unit and have fisher, kobe, doncic, derozan run with DJ. DJ is a very agile 5 that moves well up and down the court.. 

P.s I know doncic would be rookie doncic. He put up like 21, 6, and 7 on efg%49. I like that for 2 bucks.

I hesitated a lot between Lillard and Kyrie/Kemba, but in the end I thought with his unselfish play and utmost reliability at crunch time Dame came out on top. Worthy was the best Pippen substitute I could find within the price range, given that he was a good defender and an alright scorer (I really wanted to squeeze Alex English in there but, unfortunately, lackluster defence). So with the Worm and Yao we'll get rebounds for dayz and MJ can carry the offensive load which will then be carried by Luka off the bench.

I'm packing the paint against this team all day and letting Iggy, rose, Giannis, and even Brook take 3s.  Im sagging off rose and Iggy if they don't have the ball.

Also you said Iguadola is a great shooter and that is a big reach.  He's a career 70% FT% (not good) and a 33% 3 point shooter.  When playing for warriors, almost every single 3 he took was stand still wide the fuck open, people not guarding type 3s.

Imagine Giannis with Kawhi Leonard instead of Khris Middleton as his right-hand man scorer. Now also imagine a deflection on defense and you have Kawhi, Pippen, and Giannis charging at you on the fastbreak. That scoring opportunity because of the insane amount of turnovers this team would create would be something else. McMillan is there for 3 and D and playmaking. Scottie and Noah are, in my opinion, where this lineup will live and die by. They will be my enforcers on defense and my main playmakers on offense. If Giannis and Kawhi aren't playing friendly with who wants to be the #1 option (lol that's a funny thought), then these guys are there to be leaders and tell them to suck it up. Additionally, while Noah isn't the best rebounder, everyone else is an excellent rebounder for their respective position, making the fast break opportunities even scarier. The bench is full of really effective role players, where Derek Harper is a drastically underrated point guard who could score, handle, defend and shoot.

2043,2020-03-20 04:41:12,fldi4s,"> Victor Oladipo

Good call on Oladipo, I forgot to list him lol. He is actually valued at $17."
2044,2020-03-20 05:48:02,fldi4s,"Put some thought into what year of each player was the 'peak' year I'd choose and this is what I came up with:

CP3- 2008-09. Arguably his best season, he did it all offensively and defensively, leading the league in assists and steals and adding an efficient 22PPG. 


Hornacek-  1991-92. Had a near 50/40/90 year, scoring 20PPG and adding 5 assists, 5 rebounds and 2 steals per game. 


KD- 2013-14. It honestly was extremely hard to pick a season for KD, I was tossing up between his MVP year, his 50/40/90 2012-13 campaign, and one of his GSW years. In the end I had to give it to absolute prime, unstoppable KD, as he was playing in a team with a ball dominant PG that year and a team with little spacing. Imagine MVP KD on a team like this.

Lamar Odom- 2005-06. Pretty much his most efficient scoring season, to go along with consistently great rebounding and playmaking. 2006 Odom was the perfect glue guy and thats exactly the role I want him to play.

Nate Thurmond- 1972-73. Advanced stats paint this as his best defensive season of his career, and he also averaged 17-17. Ofc his scoring average would go down dramatically but the rebounding and defence are what I want from him.
Brook Lopez: 2018-19. Easy choice, shot a career best 36% from 3 and was a crazy good rim protector. This season was the best 3 and D season I've ever seen from a big.

Joakim Noah- 2013-14. He came in 4th for MVP voting this year for good reason. Decent scoring and great rebounding, with underrated playmaking from the PF spot. His greatest asset and the main one for this team was his defence, both at the rim and the perimeter. 2014 Noah was a defensive pest anywhere on the floor.

Pistol Pete- 1975-76. Chose his most efficient season rather than his highest scoring because all I need from him in this team is a spark plug off the bench that will handle the ball and make shots."
2045,2020-03-20 08:42:53,fldi4s,I just meant seasons within the NBA. That would also exclude ABA seasons.
2046,2020-03-20 09:53:40,fldi4s,"In order to counter a team like this, I think really, really good passing and crazy amounts of off-ball movement is needed. Here's a team I created that I'd like to see have them matched up against.

**2002 Kings / 2014 Spurs on Steroids:**

* PG: Dwyane Wade, 2008-09 ($31)

* SG: Rip Hamilton, 2005-06 ($4)

* SF: Tracy McGrady, 2002-03 ($29)

* PF: Chris Webber, 2001-02 ($15)

* C: Arvydas Sabonis, 1995-96 ($4)

* Backup Guard: Drazen Petrovic, 1992-93 ($3)

* Backup Forward: Doug Christie, 2002-03 ($4)

* Backup Center: Pau Gasol, 2009-10 ($10)

There will be an ungodly amount of high post action from Weber, Sabonis, and Gasol on this team. They're the first action. If nothing comes through, pass the ball to McGrady, who is a very capable passer in his own right, and make him make the right decision. He'll pass the ball if he sees something he likes or if he's doubled; if not, he's a scoring machine. Regardless, everyone with the exception of Hamilton and Petrovic are excellent playmakers. This team will wreak havoc with off-ball cuts, decoy screen actions, and big man playmaking. Dwyane Wade is the deadliest off-ball cutter of all-time imo, so this is a great team for him."
2047,2020-03-20 03:23:18,fldi4s,"This line up is definitely different than the usual. What made you pick Duncan as your largest expense? I love the big fundamental, and I think you‚Äôre the first one to put him on their list."

2049,2020-03-19 21:23:27,fldi4s,"I agree with this point on Jayson and Kristaps. But for Luka, he just seems to have ‚Äúit‚Äù. Of course there‚Äôs no playoff proof as of last season, but I would be surprised if he could hold up against some of the best PGs in a seven game series."

2053,2020-03-22 02:37:37,fldi4s,"Yeah would be asking alot of Gasol and Porzingis in that scenario. Gasol was an excellent defensive big at his peak. Made all defense 2nd team one year  finished 8th one year in the MVP vote.

My team would be amazing if I could use the 2019-20 versions of Doncic and Tatum, but I didn't realize I couldn't because I can't read. Still a solid team."

2055,2020-03-19 23:12:30,fldi4s,Yeah I didn't love any of my options at the 4. Someone suggested Porzingis which might be the move. Maybe someone like Kenyon Martin to get some grit and athleticism on the team.
2056,2020-03-19 23:14:20,fldi4s,Yeah probably. I am thinking I want someone with some muscle to be able to take on some of the more classic 4s but yeah that's probably actually the best move

2062,2020-03-20 01:40:10,fldi4s,"I'm a sixers fan so I get where you're coming from, but having multiple guys who are versatile and flexible is important, and Lowry can do a lot of what Simmons can, but also shoot and operate PNRs with Bosh and Embiid.

2072,2020-03-20 13:37:49,fldi4s,"Yes sir.

What do you think of the team? Starting 5 have so much spacing. Great playmaking with Steph, Chris, and DMC. Good defense. A nice bench. Could realistically beat any team on this thread."
2073,2020-03-19 21:41:46,fldi4s,I wanted Marc Gasol ($8) instead of DAJ but I would have gone $3 over budget
2074,2020-03-20 04:42:41,fldi4s,Haha I was wondering why he wasn't there. Seemed like a steal at $1
2075,2020-03-20 15:07:00,fldi4s,"Well when you're selecting from a bunch of greats, the scoring tends to come naturally, so I started with '03 Duncan, since he's one of the greats that has a lot of soft skills as well - winning mentality, team first, can take on whatever role the team needs at the time, plus great defense.

'77 Walton was phenomenal, as Bill Simmons wrote about in Book of Basketball. He was basically controlling the entire offense from center, and like I mentioned with Duncan above, can give the team whatever they need at the time.

'08 Deron seemed really undervalued to me. During his Utah years, he was absolutely on par with Chris Paul, who is almost 4x the price here. Deron is another high IQ versatile guy.

'19 Doncic (since we can't use '20 Doncic) was pretty good even in his rookie year. At $2, he seemed like another good take, and his lack of defense can probably be made up for by the rest of his team.

'01 Vince is a bit overpriced, but I wanted a high energy scoring focused guy on the starting lineup to balance it out.

Bench guys I was trying to get some different skillsets in. '10 Rondo can come in with high energy and has proven playoff experience. '19 KAT is an undervalued big man with range, something that a lot of teams will have a hard time defending. And '19 Tatum also seems pretty undervalued here."

2080,2020-03-20 01:37:44,fldi4s,"At the 4 Gasol can be played off the floor and he ends up needing to play the 5. 

Draymond can play either spot, and is a much better defensive player"
2081,2020-03-21 11:15:16,fldi4s,"What can dray do better besides switching?

How about

--checks notes--

passing
jumping passing lanes
defensive playmaking
shooting

I can see your clueless, comme on you're better than that :roll:"
2082,2020-03-19 18:56:08,fldi4s,"We'll see. I do have Kerr and Thompson - two of the greatest three point threats of all time - on the perimeter, able to match you shot for shot, as well as the perimeter and interior D to size-up any of your offensive threats."
2083,2020-03-20 01:26:04,fldi4s,True. If you take his best season then he shot almost 40% from 3.
2084,2020-03-20 01:34:12,fldi4s,"Both teams might score only 60 lmao. 30 of those from Hakeem because he'd give Noah the business lol. For my team, Leonard and Pippen is about the best you can get for perimeter defense. I feel like if I were to put Scottie on Ben Simmons, but disrespect him on the 3 point line, my team would have the edge on defense because Scottie would be so rangy that he could cover a lot of ground even if he's not glued to his man. I'd put McMillan on Sprewell, then Kawhi on Worthy. I feel like Kawhi would likewise do a good job of containing worthy. Sprewell, I'm not too sure of. The most interesting head-to-head matchup though would be KG vs Giannis. That'd be an absolute battle. 

For your guys on defense, they'd probably have Simmons on Kawhi. We saw last playoffs that even though Simmons did a hell of a job, Kawhi is unstoppable when healthy. You'd have Worthy on Pippen, where I'd like my chances. The problem is though that Giannis gets contained much more because of KG and Hakeem, who you could argue would be the best possible frontcourt defensive duo you can possibly create. Giannis struggles against big walls, and these guys would savor the matchup. Giannis probably gets contained. So, I think my team would rely on fastbreak opportunities from forced turnovers to get the easiest points.

In the end, I'd go my team 78 points, your team 72 points. It'd be an absolute war, for sure."
2085,2020-03-20 13:04:36,fldi4s,"Agreed - that's a little less than *half* of the salary cap allotted, and you have 7 players left for a little under $8/position. Obviously, this can be filled by the legends who played in the 50's-80's that are undervalued in this group, like /u/lucasmcn said."
2086,2020-03-20 20:03:07,fldi4s,"Yeah... remember 1998? The average *team* salary was $32.7M and the cap was at 26.9  

The Bulls paid MJ, wait for it, 33.1. Wonder how that turned out."
2087,2020-03-20 13:45:25,fldi4s,"It's okay, as it's very offensive-dominant (Curry/Klay/Mullin/Marshall/Cousins/J-Rich), and definitely the defense is the Achilles' heel, as only Klay, Iggy and Bogut play above-average defense. Both Marshall and Cousins will be exposed on the defensive end, especially against tougher, more physical teams with bigger size."
2088,2020-03-20 03:09:45,fldi4s,K but gasol at the 5 is better than draymond at the 4
2089,2020-03-20 15:33:53,fldi4s,Young Pau would be fine
2090,2020-03-21 13:08:26,fldi4s,"Passing no. Jumping passing lanes is not that valuable. He is a better shooter but it does not mater cuz he dont generate gravity and hes not a shooter either, unlike Pau who can actually go get buckets.   
Sure DRay jumps passing lanes and shoots better than Shaq and Tim Duncan but does it matter? no cuz they have different skill sets.   
In the end Dray cant make the contribution Pau or other great PF and Cs can do, even with his guardesque skills"
2091,2020-03-20 14:02:06,fldi4s,"Here's my thought process. Every starter is a positive defender in context of their position. They also would play great team defense. Pre-injury Cousins is at least decent defender. Holds his own very well in the post, and can inhale rebounds. Massive body. Same with Marshall. Good team and weak side help defender. Grabs a ton of rebounds. He also has decent size.

You can take Mullin and Cousins off, and insert Iguodala and Bogut depending on matchups. Less scoring, but more defense. Same playmaking ability.

Cousins should hold his own against big teams. Marshall might suffer against large PFs, but on offense, he would pull all of them to the perimeter. I don't think many large PFs can hang on the perimeter. With the motion offense that GS employs, you'll score on a ton of possessions."
2092,2020-03-20 03:54:16,fldi4s,"You also need to keep in mind how many good players there are at a position, and what they do. 

Gasol is a great playmaker, a good shooter for a big, and a quality post player. Problem is he isn't a great athlete, and he is a sub par defender in an all time draft like this. 

He isn't Shaq, Wilt, Kareem, Hakeem etc so you aren't asking him to be your 1st or 2nd option. Problem is he isn't a lob threat, or great pick and roll roller so his offensive value is diminished from what he'd offer in a normal team. 

Beyond that he is a poor defender foe this kind of all time draft, so as a centre you're downgrading your entire defence. 


I think Pau at his peak is a better player than his brother Marc, and overall better career. But you want defence so much from the 5. 

Draymond is similar. The value as your 5th option is going to be pretty similar to a much better offensive player, but still serving as your 5th option. While providing maybe top 3 defensive impact at the 4 all time?"
2093,2020-03-20 04:13:28,fldi4s,"Idk i still like pau. He just does so much offensively. Defensively he wasnt a stopper but he was very good. Legit number 2 on a championship squad. Draymond cant do that. His value is only there if u have all elaw filled out well, which for 26 ia impossible."
2094,2020-03-20 13:47:21,fldi4s,bro Pau almost killed team USA in 2 Olympics and raped Boston in the finals when Kobe was struggling. Dray is just a better Ron Artest
2095,2020-03-20 04:26:32,fldi4s,"He was number 2 on a championship squad in 09 and 10 in the real NBA

In this situation the teams he'll be playing will be better, they'll look more like the Warriors + with depth. 

Even with Draymond being pretty expensive, he does things that cant be as easily replaced. You pay plenty for him, then find your shot creators/shooters at positions where those things are much deeper"
2096,2020-03-20 13:24:52,fldi4s,"Heres the problem tho, he doesnt do enugh to justify the price tag when u look at who else is available in that range. Most guys over 25 are the best oe second best player u will get. Draymond doesnt bring enough to the table for what you are paying. Perfect example, but what would you have draymond for that barkley wouldnt be better at? Maybe defensively he is better, but the gap in literally every other facet in the game is so massive its no contest. Pau for 10 can fill out an elite roster in my mind as the 4th or 5th best player, bc thats what you pay for him. For 26, draymond has to justify picking him over players in that price range as the best or second best on the team, and i really dont see it (he costs more than klay)"
2097,2020-03-20 17:35:22,fldi4s,"Just to clarify, these prices weren‚Äôt my personal opinion but based on average draft position from 25+ people each over 6 drafts. 

However, Draymond is clearly a much passer passer and 3-point shooter at peak than Barkley, it‚Äôs not just his defense that places him this highly. He is great at everything you need out of your 2nd best player when your scoring is already figured out, which is why he was so highly coveted. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd personally take him at $26 but I don‚Äôt see the issue with taking him either given how absurd his 2015-16 season was. 

People did not value Pau Gasol‚Äôs peak as highly because a lot of his value comes from scoring, which every team already has a lot of because there are already so many good scorers, and his passing, defending and 3-point shooting were inferior to Draymond. Rebounding also turned out to not be very highly-valued either. Pau may be the better player in a vacuum but I think (2015-16) Draymond is easily a better supporting player when you already have elite scoring. It may have been a bit of an outlier season (especially the shooting) but this is a single-season exercise after all."
2098,2020-03-20 18:04:57,fldi4s,"Thats fair enough. I just can not persobally justify for such a challenge taking draymond for the price. To be clear i do like draymond as a player, i just dont think that the value on him justifies taking him over a lot of other players, wheras gasols value means there are not too many guys at his price i would put over him. Just imo"

This team is built to run and score the hell out of the ball. The backbone is Nash and Chamberlain, who would be an almost unfair SSOL matchup. Barry rounds out scoring alongside Chamberlain, with Griffin being capable of stretching the floor beside Wilt as well as performing secondary ballhandling as needed. Griffin would also be a killer lob threat here, as expected. Dumars rounds out the starting 5 with defense and shooting, plus is able to handle the ball beside Nash.

The bench were some of the best value pieces I could find, with the idea of stretching out the floor and letting Chamberlain feast inside. Maravich is absolutely absurd value at $5, and is going to be the world's best sixth man running the floor and jacking up shots. VanDeWegh is a nice complimentary piece, and once again pulls gravity out. Aldridge is good value as well, and would fit great as a pick and pop + general midrange threat, while also having a good post game inside.

Overall, the team is a bit weak on defense, but they would score so damn much that might not matter. I think this is about the best you can get for exactly $100."

2119,2020-03-18 22:12:19,fky9sj,"That would've been the top post of all time had reddit existed back then. Probably the 90's version of something like: 

[Wojnarowski] MJ: ""I'm back"""
2120,2020-03-18 22:12:30,fky9sj,"In the 3 full seasons of his return, MJ accumulated:

- 29.6 PPG - 31.4 (playoffs)

- 4.0 APG

- 6.1 RPG

- 203-43 reg. season record 

- 45-13 playoff record

- 2x MVP

- 3x scoring leader

- 3x All Star

- 3x All NBA

- 3x All Defense 

- 3x Finals MVP

- 3x NBA Champion"
2121,2020-03-19 21:36:53,fky9sj,"Even if we count his 1.5y of retirement in between, I have never ever seen such a dominance.
In 8 seasons guy won 6 titles, 6 x FMVP, 4 x MVP, 6 x top scorer, 6 x All NBA, 6 x All def, 1 steals leader.

And every fuckin time he stepped up his game during playoffs.

I said hundred times, people don't realise how good this man was.

Literally GOD"
2122,2020-03-18 23:04:33,fky9sj,"Someone posted a google forum thread from the 1980s that said Jordan was overrated. If reddit was a thing back then and somehow managed to stay relevant, the immortalized nephew takes would‚Äôve been incredible to see."

[Woj] Phoenix Suns become 5th team to voluntarily self-quarantine as Charles Barkley explores medical options."
2124,2020-03-18 22:51:44,fky9sj,"good case that it should have been 3x MVP as well. that playoff record is the craziest part, though. 13 losses in three title runs? 12 series. are you kidding me?"
2125,2020-03-18 22:33:19,fky9sj,Absolutely disgusting
2126,2020-03-18 23:49:38,fky9sj,"Insanity. You really can't make an argument against MJ for GOAT when it comes to accolades, win record and personal stats. Dude just had everything"

2134,2020-03-17 18:02:29,fk9suy,"The fact that Kyrie is on a team is disrespectful, couldn't even put CP3 or Magic??"
2135,2020-03-17 18:02:44,fk9suy,Team a. Unless it‚Äôs today‚Äôs rules... then it‚Äôs team a
2136,2020-03-17 18:07:01,fk9suy,"Team A wins 110-95. Player vs Player Team B only wins one match-up (Jordan) and the idea of having to defend an aggressive and charging LeBron, Giannis and Shaq seems impossible."
2137,2020-03-17 18:25:55,fk9suy,"I think team B. I understand team A has more star power, but I question how these pieces will fit together. Team B has much better spacing which would benefit Jordan as the primary ball handler. My concern with team A would be how clogged the paint would be. Shaq, lebron, Giannis and to a lesser extent Kobe, all need paint touches (through drives and post touches) to maximize their value."
2138,2020-03-17 18:07:47,fk9suy,"A, but B is insanely handicapped. No offense to Kyrie and Kawhi, but they don't belong on this list, much less on the same team. If B was, say, Isiah Thomas, MJ, KD, Larry Bird, and Duncan, then it'd be close. But even then, A is going to be hard to overcome."
2139,2020-03-17 18:43:54,fk9suy,"B. A‚Äôs spacing isn‚Äôt the best outside of Curry and Kobe. LeBron will be handling the ball a ton, who is he going to kick out to? Shaq? Giannis? Duncan, Kawhi and MJ would lock team A up purely due today spacing. Team A has the better players, Team B works better."
2140,2020-03-17 18:08:38,fk9suy,Team A
2141,2020-03-17 19:00:18,fk9suy,"The two best defenders are on team B, while also have three great 3 point shooters and the goat in MJ. Team B easy"
2142,2020-03-18 15:26:51,fk9suy,"You're asking a sub who are mainly Curry, LeBron, and Laker stans about which team is better. We KNOW what team the majority will choose without even thinking about it.

Shaq could be a huge problem for for Team B, but due to the lack of spacing on Team A that could definitely help mitigate the issue.

Ky, MJ, and KD would give of their match-ups fits. With superior spacing provided by team Team B, this would be much closer than most expect."
2143,2020-03-17 18:06:57,fk9suy,"A, who‚Äôs stopping Shaq or Giannis? I‚Äôm assuming  Jordan will be on steph and Kawhi on Lebron. This is just a matchup nightmare for team B."
2144,2020-03-17 18:02:21,fk9suy,Team C
2145,2020-03-17 18:23:09,fk9suy,Stockton.
2146,2020-03-17 18:13:08,fk9suy,Lmfao
2147,2020-03-17 18:27:51,fk9suy,Interesting analysis. Does anyone have anything to say about the chemistry of each team? How do each of these players‚Äô styles of basketball fit in with one another?
2148,2020-03-17 18:14:22,fk9suy,I‚Äôd take prime Kawhi over Bird. That may be recency bias though. I just feel his defense is crucial for team B.
2149,2020-03-17 18:47:50,fk9suy,Nice input. The dynamic between each team is super important‚Äîwhich you bring up. I think just hearing the names it‚Äôs really easy to say Team A would win because they have more overall talent.
2150,2020-03-17 18:10:13,fk9suy,"Kyrie on Steph, KD on Kobe, MJ on LeBron, Kawhi on Giannis, Duncan on Shaq"
2151,2020-03-17 18:26:53,fk9suy,Or Curry the better player
2152,2020-03-17 18:17:56,fk9suy,Love Kawhi but that‚Äôs complete disrespect to Bird
2153,2020-03-17 18:56:54,fk9suy,"Put Magic on Team B and they win easy imo. A definitely has more superstar talent, but B just works so much better."
2154,2020-03-17 18:12:29,fk9suy,"If this is all Prime versions of each player, Shaq is easily carrying that team. And I don‚Äôt think a 6‚Äô6 220 dude can guard prime Bron."
2155,2020-03-17 18:37:23,fk9suy,Curry's first name is Steph
2156,2020-03-17 18:56:28,fk9suy,Curry's going to play on both teams?
2157,2020-03-17 18:22:57,fk9suy,"I‚Äôm going off of defense and matchups alone, if Bird replaces Kawhi, then he has to go up against either Giannis or Lebron and he‚Äôs going to get cooked on both ends."
2158,2020-03-17 18:24:12,fk9suy,"It's ""disrespect"" to compare Bird to an MVP-level player? Kawhi Leonard is one of the best players of the last 20 years. If he had been playing at this level for five or more years instead of just 2.5, this wouldn't even be a debate."
2159,2020-03-17 18:13:49,fk9suy,"Cmon dude, Tim Duncan and Michael fucking Jordan would be fine guarding Shaq and LeBron"
2160,2020-03-17 19:27:27,fk9suy,Maybe I was talking about Seth
2161,2020-03-17 18:36:56,fk9suy,"Bird isn‚Äôt as good as LeBron but he‚Äôs one of the 7 best players ever, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd do fine."
2162,2020-03-17 18:37:36,fk9suy,That‚Äôs how good Bird was
2163,2020-03-17 18:46:34,fk9suy,Bird took a 29 win Celtic team and turned them into a 60 win team. Bird also made some all defensive teams before his back problems.  Theres a reason he‚Äôs a all time great.
2164,2020-03-17 18:43:47,fk9suy,"Also, when has Kawhi ever come close to winning MVP?"
2165,2020-03-17 18:16:37,fk9suy,"Legit question, because I understand how great of a defender Jordan is which is why I think he‚Äôd put up a respectable fight, but did he ever have to guard anyone his OWN size let alone Lebron‚Äôs?

Edit: guarding someone that was also great, not just any average player."
2166,2020-03-17 23:23:33,fk9suy,Don‚Äôt forget Del Curry
2167,2020-03-17 19:49:11,fk9suy,Then you'd be dumb thinking he's better than Stockton.
2168,2020-03-17 19:37:21,fk9suy,You right.
2169,2020-03-17 18:45:39,fk9suy,"MVP-level obviously means one of the best players in the game, not literally an MVP winner"
2170,2020-03-17 18:46:18,fk9suy,"He came second in 2015-16 (67-15 team record) and third in 2016-17 (61-21 record). He'll likely finish in the top three this season as well. And it's not about actually winning it, it's about being good enough to win it. There are always three or four MVP-worthy players in a season, but only one can actually win it."
2171,2020-03-17 19:07:35,fk9suy,"Fair point on being on the list of 3-4 players, but I think my point still stands on never coming close to actually winning. 

2016 first place votes = 0 / 131

2017 first place votes = 9 / 101

2020 I‚Äôd be shocked if he gets even one vote

I guess my point is Bird was good enough to win 3 straight MVPs while winning 2 championships during that span."

2192,2020-03-14 02:26:32,fib9qc,Titans fan? Really sounds like you're a colts fan for hooking us up with that haul
2193,2020-03-14 03:20:55,fib9qc,Best 3 round mock I‚Äôve seen for the broncos easily imo. Thank you incredibly done. You‚Äôve clearly done your homework. Keep up the good work.
2194,2020-03-14 02:56:03,fib9qc,"Great draft for the Panthers, and, in fact, most if not all of these teams had a great draft overall."
2195,2020-03-14 02:24:24,fib9qc,"I just really do not love Laviska as a prospect, and especially at #30. I just do not see it in him, great athlete but has injury concerns. Mims/Aiyuk/Reagor really are the targets that would compliment Adams since they have speed, while Adams isn't the burner. 

You have Jalen Reagor going in the 3rd, and I'd rather have him at #30 over Laviska. The one thing about Aaron Rodgers is that he wants route runners, and Laviska not having that aspect in his game is definitely not going to get his attention."
2196,2020-03-14 06:13:27,fib9qc,Not too fond of the Bain pick. I know you mentioned versatility but we don‚Äôt have a need for off ball linebackers and he‚Äôs undersized to play 43 edge
2197,2020-03-14 03:14:22,fib9qc,"I really like Wills at 4, want Baun bad in second but with him gone I like the choice. Ballsy 3rd rounder going for depth instead of defensive help or WR in this draft. We'll see but I like it"
2198,2020-03-14 05:49:29,fib9qc,"The picks are fine, I just want to note: the Panthers haven't run a 3-4 this millennium so Simmons' fit in a 3-4 isn't really relevant. Rhule and Snow, IIRC, used a 4-3 front at Temple and then switched to a 3-3-5 base at Baylor. What this tells me is that they're flexible and able to adapt their scheme to the talent they have. The best guess we have right now for that the defense will look like under Rhule and Snow is a multiple front that runs mostly nickel packages. Simmons would be a great fit as he can fill 4 different roles in that scheme (off-ball LB, slot CB, pass rusher or safety).

This isn't the first mock to have the Panthers grabbing Delpit in the 2nd round and I absolutely love it. We've struggled at Safety forever, it seems, so adding all this talent on defense will be huge for establishing an identity and getting us back to competitive."
2199,2020-03-14 12:37:19,fib9qc,I would hope the Ravens would take Madubuike  or Weaver over a guard/center in the 2nd-if the draft fell this way.
2200,2020-03-14 14:05:21,fib9qc,"I would be fine with this draft for the Eagles, but if we do end up signing one of the top CB FA's I think we seriously consider Xavier McKinney at #21."
2201,2020-03-14 14:31:48,fib9qc,"I really hope the pats don‚Äôt grab Jennings and Fromm in the 3rd.

[Guard] Ben Bredeson,
[LB] Evan Weaver,
[TE] Hunter Bryant (I like Moss, too),
[WR] Antonio Gibson 

Unless I missed them these guys are available and would be better fit. I also think each one will be more successful in the nfl at their respective positions. 

Why waste a third round pick on Fromm when he isn‚Äôt much better than Stidham. They have the same ceiling.

But that‚Äôs just me being critical about my team. Great draft overall and I like a lot of picks. Jefferson to the saints would be filthy."
2202,2020-03-14 03:55:14,fib9qc,"The non-stupid translation for ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt want another speed rusher‚Äù is ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt afford to keep taking chances on underdeveloped potential players and keep missing, and Chaisson has low production to back up his athleticism‚Äù

Kinlaw is 100% the pick for me on this board."

2207,2020-03-14 03:15:29,fib9qc,"Can I ask why you doubled down on OL for us?

2214,2020-03-14 03:21:26,fib9qc,Titans fan that hurts pick up sucks. Much more talent out there for a team with as many teams as the raiders.
2215,2020-03-14 05:32:50,fib9qc,As an Eagles fan if Kinlaw is on the board at 21 I feel they snag him. Howie loves building through the trenches and we are thin at DT. I can live with the rest of the picks
2216,2020-03-14 12:18:24,fib9qc,I'd be so mad if we pass on Mims and Raegor.
2217,2020-03-14 08:43:10,fib9qc,No other prospect considered for the Dolphins at 39 is absurd.
2218,2020-03-14 12:29:29,fib9qc,If the Bills had a chance to get YGM and Higgins but took Epenesa instead I‚Äôd cry. I‚Äôd be happy with either of them at 22!
2219,2020-03-14 17:52:29,fib9qc,"...look, I get we're rivals, but like, no O-line in any of the top 3 rounds? Safety in rd. 2? Why do you hate us so much?!?"
2220,2020-03-14 02:27:16,fib9qc,I always seem to give the Colts the best drafts. You guys would be scary next year with this squad.
2221,2020-03-14 03:51:58,fib9qc,Thanks!
2222,2020-03-14 02:26:31,fib9qc,That's pretty fair but Shenaults athleticism and versatility offers a lot for Rodgers. Rodgers hasn't had a great YAC threat since Cobb's prime years and Shenault offers that in bunches. I think Mims or Aiyuk would also be good picks here just based on your personal preference.
2223,2020-03-14 09:43:31,fib9qc,"There's two criteria for the Hawks to draft you as a LB, either you're huge or you run an incredible shuttle. KJ is one of the longest linebackers ever, everyone else has dominated the shuttle. Baun is small and a bad athlete."
2224,2020-03-14 14:55:02,fib9qc,"I have to agree. I like Baun as a prospect, but I only think he‚Äôs a value there in an odd front scheme."
2225,2020-03-14 15:37:16,fib9qc,"I agree. Especially with Okwara available. People may like Baun as a prospect more, but Okwara is a perfect fit for our biggest need. He's probably my favorite player for Seattle in this draft."
2226,2020-03-14 15:47:51,fib9qc,I'd trade down to early mid second round so we can get Ruiz or Okwara
2227,2020-03-14 19:56:55,fib9qc,"> the Panthers haven't run a 3-4 this millennium so Simmons' fit in a 3-4 isn't really relevant.

Dude we ran a hybrid 3-4 last year."
2228,2020-03-14 12:51:25,fib9qc,You're not worried about the Yanda retirement combined with the IOL not being a huge strength to begin with?
2229,2020-03-14 05:12:24,fib9qc,Well said
2230,2020-03-14 02:22:07,fib9qc,I just recently scouted Akers and I like him a lot. I think he could go to PIT at 102 in this draft and should go top of round 3. It's just hard to fit HBs in this draft bc so few teams need a HB as much as they do other positions.
2231,2020-03-14 02:20:45,fib9qc,Side note tho: honestly really solid draft and loved these picks for the Colts.
2232,2020-03-14 03:53:54,fib9qc,I think Reiff is just not cutting it at LT. It's never a bad idea to look at future options at tackle. I know the other needs could've been addressed but I didn't see the value. Reiff will start in 2020 but I think having a backup long term plan is in the best interest of Minnesota.
2233,2020-03-14 03:51:40,fib9qc,Andrew Thomas would be a great pick. I'm not sure what your front office thinks about Cam Robinson. I think they should move on but Caldwell isn't known for making smart draft decisions on the regular.
2234,2020-03-14 04:45:09,fib9qc,Do you honestly want another HB? I'm just curious with you guys already spending a lot of capital on Penny when it wasn't a need.
2235,2020-03-14 14:52:57,fib9qc,That makes a lot of sense too. I like Wanogho's upside but Ezra could definitely be the pick there.
2236,2020-03-14 02:25:00,fib9qc,Idk about you but I would be extremely happy if Higgins fell to the 2nd for the Bills. You guys need a big bodied WR that can make some contested catches and jump balls downfield. Higgins is really good at that and would make y'all's WR corps one of the best trios in the league.
2237,2020-03-14 03:50:51,fib9qc,Ya it's so hard to predict QB spots before this hectic free agency. I think Hurts is someone Gruden would fall in love with pre draft. It's just a thought and with 3 third rounders I think it's worth a shot
2238,2020-03-14 12:49:59,fib9qc,"Grabbing the top HB in the draft at the worst position group in the NFL, in terms of HBs, seems like a no-brainer to me. You could substitute it with Taylor or Dobbins if you want but it's great value to get HB1 at 39."
2239,2020-03-14 02:54:22,fib9qc,Considering how well you guys have drafted recently I will take any wisdom y'all are offering
2240,2020-03-14 02:34:52,fib9qc,"Another thing I should note is that Mim's ability to be physical, and being a willing (and a good) blocker down field is a boost for the Packers and their offense because they want to run the football. Matt LaFleur has praised the WRs blocking last season, and that was a reason why Lazard/Kumerow saw so much field time later down the season, while MVS snap counts dwindled. 

Aiyuk/Mim's offer a variety of things to the Packers that in my opinion, Laviska does not."
2241,2020-03-14 16:30:44,fib9qc,I don‚Äôt think you watch packers games if you don‚Äôt think davante is a rac monster. He is shifty after the catch. The packers need a deep threat
2242,2020-03-14 20:52:40,fib9qc,"No, we ran a multiple front, and barely used any 3-4 looks at that. Why? Because this team was built to be a 4-3 team and thus lacked the players to properly use a 3-4 front. Shaq is a 4-3 OLB strictly, too small to play inside in a 3-4 and not big enough to rush the passer as an OLB. Short and McCoy are much, *much* better at 3-tech than 5-tech and Mario Addison isn't good enough in coverage to make up for taking him away from rushing the passer. Last year's defensive front was a pathetic attempt by Rivera to salvage his job, both by putting up huge sack numbers to make his defense look good even though we were historically bad against the run and to give him an excuse to squeeze out another year from Tepper by pretending to try new things and needing more time to make them work."
2243,2020-03-14 12:53:32,fib9qc,"I‚Äôm worried about it; but not as much as edge and  def line.

We also have some young guys that may be able to step up-paired with a highly mobile QB, and a strong history of developing awesome offensive linemen with later picks in the draft.

Worried? Yes.  But not as big of a need as the front 7."
2244,2020-03-14 03:47:54,fib9qc,"I've noticed that this year, for a while I kept thinking Swift, JT, and Dobbins would be end of 1st/beginning of 2nd but then I did a 3 round mock and just had a really hard time finding teams who needed RBs, especially with all the other talent available at other positions."
2245,2020-03-14 03:53:36,fib9qc,cam is awful. norwell was awful. but maybe because of cam. but he just didn't look good either. they need a really top OL to be an LT. and then try to figure something out trying cam at a guard position or norwell. mix it up and figure it out. cant get worse.
2246,2020-03-14 04:52:17,fib9qc,"He‚Äôs one of my crushes. Along with Chase Claypool, and K‚ÄôVon Wallace. I do think we‚Äôll need one though. Probably not in the 3rd, unless we trade back for some extra picks. It‚Äôs pretty unlikely Lynch is back. And Prosise is pretty much done (although we say that every year). Just leaves Carson and Homer. And Carson is a UFA next year."
2247,2020-03-14 09:47:44,fib9qc,"We do. Carson has a long injury history, Penny hasn't been able to stay healthy in the pros despite being a horse in college and Carson is an FA next year, really would rather not pay him 10M.

That said, not with a top 100 pick. We need way too much help along both trenches to be drafting another RB that high. Save it for the 4th and later."
2248,2020-03-14 02:28:49,fib9qc,Just curious I like the pick there are just other wrs
2249,2020-03-14 03:53:43,fib9qc,People say gruden is in love with every qb. I think the titans would take hurts over the raiders. The titans dont even have mariota or Tannehill at this point. It's not worth a shot. Another lb or corner would be worth a shot
2250,2020-03-14 18:47:03,fib9qc,"You‚Äôre seriously underestimating the Dolphins needs to project a RB there. Winfield Jr, Davis, Ruiz, Would all take priority for me. Especially since Dobbins was available at 56"
2251,2020-03-14 18:36:37,fib9qc,Get a room jeez. Thought y'all were rivals...
2252,2020-03-14 12:43:12,fib9qc,"I'd definitely consider Tee Higgens there to, but I'd prefer Raegor over all"
2253,2020-03-14 21:09:28,fib9qc,"Those are all good and true points. I guess I'm just saying I understand why people mocking to us might think we run a 3-4, where in actuality it's more complicated than that.

I actually love the idea of Simmons in Snow's 3-3-5 where he could effectively rush the passer or drop into coverage on every snap allowing us to disguise schemes or rotate coverages. Hell, I think he could even play MLB in a 4-3. Him and Shaq when we're in the 4-2-5 nickel packages we use most often (**Edit** or at least that we used to run most often) would give us some major range and sideline speed as well. The guy could play anything from DE to ILB to FS, he's just an insane prospect."
2254,2020-03-14 19:00:11,fib9qc,Erm I mean you stink. Boo your team
2255,2020-03-15 00:59:51,fib9qc,"I couldn't agree more, Simmons paired with a creative DC who's willing to use him all over the field is an incredible prospect. I think Rhule and Snow would love a piece like Simmons to build their defense around to truly make it difficult for the QB to see what's coming every play. I'm honestly trying not to hype him up too much because I don't want to get my hopes up only to see us pass him up, if he even makes it to our pick in the first place."

2264,2020-03-12 20:35:16,fhl3sx,"I think if we‚Äôre being real, we need to add Mbappe to Emery‚Äôs purchases. Yes, I know it was a loan when he joined. However, the loan was structured to avoid violating ffp. There was no option to buy. There was only an obligation to buy if PSG didn‚Äôt get relegated. And if we‚Äôre being honest, there‚Äôs a greater chance of Di Maria saying ‚ÄúI loved my time at Manchester United‚Äù than PSG getting relegated.

Two other points that are unrelated to the previous one:

1) The list doesn‚Äôt account for inflation. 50m even 4 years ago is probably 100m now. Look at Kante. He was 35m in 2016. But in today‚Äôs market, he‚Äôs would have cost 90m

2) At some clubs, the manager doesn‚Äôt have a lot of say in transfers. So it isn‚Äôt very accurate to attribute player purchases at those clubs to that manager. For example, Barca purchased Coutinho and Dembele for around 300m+. Were they Valverde‚Äôs purchase or Barca‚Äôs purchases?"

2266,2020-03-12 18:55:01,fhl3sx,What about Pepe for Emery?

2270,2020-03-12 19:54:46,fhl3sx,Funny that people will still say Mourinho was the victim of a poor squad at United. He undoubtedly played a role in a number of those signings.

2335,2020-03-12 18:53:14,fhl3sx,"I agree, thinking of Ronaldo and Kaka as ""Pellegrini buys"" is ridiculous, it's clearly Perez. Pellegrini just happened to be the manager at the time"
2336,2020-03-12 20:11:22,fhl3sx,IIRC he was supposed to sign for Big Sam's Blackburn but that Icelandic volcano erupted and he joined BVB
2337,2020-03-12 21:03:22,fhl3sx,And it's not like Klopp went out of his way to scout and transfer a player from the Polish league.
2338,2020-03-12 20:42:34,fhl3sx,"Also if we‚Äôre accounting for inflation, he‚Äôd likely be close to the top. We got Rio for 30m. He‚Äôd likely cost 120m now, while Rooney would have cost Mbappe money"
2339,2020-03-12 18:41:42,fhl3sx,Forgot he went to China. My bad
2340,2020-03-13 03:01:22,fhl3sx,You could argue that he would be better at the 6 role than McTominay.
2341,2020-03-13 04:40:16,fhl3sx,"Who are these mystery men who‚Äôve managed City but not also one of the traditional superclubs? The last 3 City managers came from Inter, Madrid and Barca/Bayern respectively.

Also implying City haven‚Äôt been one of the biggest teams since 2010 is disingenuous. Before then maybe not, but current City are certainly on par with other teams here like Atleti and PSG in status."
2342,2020-03-12 19:17:38,fhl3sx,LVG isn‚Äôt active is he
2343,2020-03-12 18:58:46,fhl3sx,"Ah thanks for checking on that! Surprised Wenger is so high, but again maybe those three extra years on the end helped?"
2344,2020-03-12 20:39:37,fhl3sx,"Even in Pelligrini‚Äôs final season at City, their purchases were geared towards getting what Peo wanted"
2345,2020-03-12 20:25:33,fhl3sx,"Zlatan to Barca under Pep is another lol

Clearly not a Pep player and if they were publicly honest shit it, neither Pep nor Zlatan would say Pep wanted him there."
2346,2020-03-17 00:43:54,fhl3sx,"I would disagree. Scott is younger, as well."
2347,2020-03-12 19:26:10,fhl3sx,In the bedroom he is
2348,2020-03-12 19:30:05,fhl3sx,Is he retired though?
2349,2020-03-12 19:45:48,fhl3sx,Don't think he's officially retired
2350,2020-03-12 19:11:56,fhl3sx,over 22 years but the lsst 3 definitely helped with xhaka-mustafi-perez for 100m. also aubameyang and lacazette within a couple months of each other. also afaik transfermarkt data counts alexis-mkhi swap as 30m each instead of a straight swap based on their market value
2351,2020-03-12 19:30:17,fhl3sx,Horny boy
2352,2020-03-12 20:02:27,fhl3sx,Him saying the words ‚Äòsex masochism‚Äô is burned into my memory and I‚Äôm not overly happy about it.
2353,2020-03-12 19:26:52,fhl3sx,"You‚Äôre the bedroom? Hey, I can‚Äôt dispute that

Edit: whoops, just realised you changed it"
2354,2020-03-12 20:36:53,fhl3sx,He is
2355,2020-03-12 12:55:19,fhenn0,"It took me a long time to come out as bi because I didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúattracted enough‚Äù to women. Then I started having sex with them and that helped me realize I was probably gay enough to consider myself bi. I sat on that feeling for 20 years before trying anything with women because I was worried I wouldn‚Äôt like it. But I think that was the ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment for me.

But it also doesn‚Äôt need a label unless you want it to have one. That was the most important takeaway from my time as a closeted Bi. I stressed about what/who I was so much that it distracted me from finding out for sure. Don‚Äôt feel like you have to be on a timeline or figure it out right now. Just enjoy looking at pretty dudes if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre into."
2356,2020-03-12 11:31:04,fhenn0,I can relate to this so much. I'm sorry I can't help you with this seeing I'm going through the same thing but I hope ou get the help you're looking for
2357,2020-03-12 12:19:55,fhenn0,"Hey! Maybe you'd be able to relate to the term bicurious? I'm not entirely sure if I'm giving you the right term, but hopefully it is something that helps you figure things out!"
2358,2020-03-12 12:50:41,fhenn0,"Maybe you just have men you would try you know.

Maybe you're straight-ish"
2359,2020-03-12 13:19:17,fhenn0,First off it doesn‚Äôt have to be 50/50. Secondly it is about romantic and sexual attraction. Are you sexually or romantically attracted? Would you have sex with a guy or can you fall in love with one even without sex?
2360,2020-03-12 15:37:47,fhenn0,Odds are it's bi. Like noone can tell you but liking guys even a little bit puts you on the bi rainbow
2361,2020-03-13 00:31:30,fhenn0,"bruh, I can relate to this so much, except my standards are even more limited, I‚Äôm attracted to feminine sex characteristics and also turned off by dicks, I honestly thought I was lesbian until I found out that the persons gender is a factor in some people‚Äôs attractions, for example, from what I understand, a lesbian might be attracted to Kristen Stewart, but if she came out as a guy, the lesbian would lose interest because they aren‚Äôt attracted to guys, which I found interesting, because I didn‚Äôt know that gender could be that important of a factor for some people, for me it‚Äôs not a factor at all, and that‚Äôs how I found out I‚Äôm pan"
2362,2020-03-12 16:16:18,fhenn0,"Thanks for the advice. I personally like having labels. It makes me feel less confused. Obviously that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm going to jump to conclusions, but as I‚Äôve been reading these comments I‚Äôve realized a lot about myself. I need to do some serious soul-searching, but, as of right now, I think I can semi-proudly say that I am a bisexual* man.

*subject to change lol"
2363,2020-03-12 12:34:16,fhenn0,"I‚Äôll look into it. In any case, thanks for taking the time!"
2364,2020-03-12 12:54:05,fhenn0,"Well, I‚Äôm already straight-ish"
2365,2020-03-11 02:05:44,fgpesp,"I am genuinely excited to watch the Suns this season and that is not something i have been able to say for a few years now, they have had plenty of high picks over the years but i can't wait to watch not just this years crop but more development from last years as well. 

Very excited to watch Lukosius off half back, Rankine anywhere and Sharp is another one i hope is best 22 by the end of the season. Expect Brodie to take that next step forward again and hopefully a more competitive team will see Sexton start to get the recognition he deserves."
2366,2020-03-11 02:12:07,fgpesp,"Credit top the GCS fans who dedicated time to contribute to this write up. Thanks!

*EDIT: Credit for the Simpsons reference... I'm a Brick!*"
2367,2020-03-11 03:00:55,fgpesp,"The ins versus outs looks pretty good.

I hope there suns do really well this year.

Also maybe not a popular opinion but I like the blue jumpers."
2368,2020-03-11 09:51:00,fgpesp,"I liked how they started last season. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre going to be charging into the finals this year, but I expect them to be competitive in the lower half of the ladder. If they can avoid losing too many to injuries, and with some confidence, they could pull some upsets this year. (Probably against Sydney, just my luck ;))"
2369,2020-03-11 08:30:18,fgpesp,"Every year i am so hopeful for the suns, this year is by far the most hopeful AND excited ive been to watch them!"
2370,2020-03-11 02:01:50,fgpesp,"My Gold Coast player to watch is Macpherson; Looked really good throughout the pre-season games.

Great write-up, hopefully the undefeated pre-season translates to more consistent wins this year."
2371,2020-03-11 10:43:03,fgpesp,A+++ Title
2372,2020-03-11 10:46:30,fgpesp,Top shelf Simpsons reference
2373,2020-03-11 02:36:57,fgpesp,"I remember watching the Suns' first win over Port and being so excited for the promise of the club.

Here's to hoping they can at least beat Port again this year?"
2374,2020-03-11 03:06:35,fgpesp,Excellent title game /u/Lubberkins
2375,2020-03-11 06:09:23,fgpesp,"Gold Coast feels like they're on the cusp of getting it all together. As long as they can have a moderately successful run with injuries, they should be contending in the logjam that is the 7th-13th region."
2376,2020-03-11 04:12:04,fgpesp,I reckon they‚Äôll do alright this season. Maybe 5 to 7 wins?
2377,2020-03-11 04:17:07,fgpesp,Suns have a good shot at surprising people this year. At their best I see them challenging for top 8. Dew should be signed long term now that he has this core group under his wing. All the best to yall.
2378,2020-03-11 05:12:07,fgpesp,Suns are a team to watch this year. I think 6-7 wins is 100% achievable and probably more. They were certainly showing a way more interesting style in the preseason.
2379,2020-03-11 05:16:04,fgpesp,They started off so well last year then fell away altogether...probably more of the same this season for the Suns unfortunately. If they can get to 6 wins and not suffer too many 10+ goal defeats it'll be a successful season imo.
2380,2020-03-11 06:04:18,fgpesp,"Jarrod Witts is awesome, still a bit sad we let him go, but he wouldn't have got much game time behind Grundy."
2381,2020-03-11 09:36:49,fgpesp,Looki looki here's tooki!
2382,2020-03-11 13:12:34,fgpesp,Great write-up but was a bit surprised to see my comments referenced. Can't wait for the season to start!
2383,2020-03-11 05:27:23,fgpesp,"As a neutral, i still think the Suns‚Äô lack of experience and lack of genuine A graders will mean they take out the spoon again, but I‚Äôm still really excited to see how they play. They‚Äôve got loads of potential all over the ground, it‚Äôs just about gelling together and giving the young guys the experience they need to form a cohesive, damaging team. I reckon Lukosius will be really damaging off half back, I already love watching Rankine play, Fiorini is one of the silkiest players in the comp, King has potential coming out of his ears and I think he‚Äôll hit 40 45 goals this season. Sexton as well is another guy who‚Äôs great around goals. Add the young guns who are about to take the next step like Ainsworth, Brodie and Bowes and you‚Äôve got a pretty exciting team. They‚Äôve just gotta put the pieces together and in a couple of years time they‚Äôll be right up there challenging for finals, if not the top 4."
2384,2020-03-11 06:57:34,fgpesp,That would be bottom 8 at best
2385,2020-03-11 07:29:28,fgpesp,"For the best 22, I would easily replace Wright with Day. I have a few other changes too:


FB: Harbrow, Thompson, Ballard
HB: Bowes, Collins, Lukosius

R: Witts, Swallow, Rowell
C: B. Ellis, Greenwood, Powell

HF: Sexton, Day, Anderson
FF: Rankine, King, MacPherson

I: Ainsworth, Weller, Fiorini, Miller

I would possibly include Sharp and Budarick also."
2386,2020-03-11 09:19:11,fgpesp,Final year for Harbrow? I thought last year he was one of your most consistent players. Did I miss something?
2387,2020-03-11 02:57:40,fgpesp,"Yeah, I feel the same way"
2388,2020-03-11 09:43:45,fgpesp,"I really hope Sharp becomes a good player, otherwise questions will again have to be asked of Gold Coasts recruiting."
2389,2020-03-11 03:04:48,fgpesp,There is something familiar about the blue/gold colour scheme that I like
2390,2020-03-11 05:48:58,fgpesp,Top 8 is a bit of a stretch
2391,2020-03-11 12:14:50,fgpesp,"He's turning 32, it'll depend on how his body holds up"
2392,2020-03-11 03:18:15,fgpesp,It would make it almost bearable to support them as a West Coast fan I would think.
2393,2020-03-11 06:31:12,fgpesp,You're not wrong but around 7-14 are all in a weird state of flux this season. So many different combinations can occur and with the suns completely capable of 10th this season means 9 or even 8 in a perfect storm is possible.
2394,2020-03-11 11:46:53,fgpesp,"The 8th best team in the comp is who right now?

I think whoever finishes 8 might be whoever has the best injury run between the non-top 7 sides. I would be a bit surprised if Crows, Blues, Suns or Dockers, but it‚Äôs a non-zero chance IMO.

Before pre season I was tossing between North and Hawks for 8th. Right now it might between Saints and Port. Ultimately I think you back Clarko to get the Hawks to 8...but apart from their mids they are putting square pegs in round holes around the ground.

All these teams 8-18 are very flawed"

2527,2020-03-10 15:33:47,fgfl6x,Appreciate the effort but... this doesnt make much sense to make a top 100 list of guys who shouldnt be on the list.
2528,2020-03-10 16:25:31,fgfl6x,"0 fullbacks, why even make this list"
2529,2020-03-10 17:32:17,fgfl6x,"22 - Tress Way

Amen"
2530,2020-03-10 19:21:34,fgfl6x,"TJ, Minkah, and Heyward all made this list, therefore it is doctrine."
2531,2020-03-10 23:06:54,fgfl6x,Ertz is so overrated. holy hell. if he was this good the eagles offense wouldn't look pathetic. but hes not. hes average at the moment
2532,2020-03-10 16:25:02,fgfl6x,"You‚Äôre going to have to do a lot of convincing to sell me on Deshaun Watson being a better QB than Rodgers. Rodgers has more yards, the same amount of TDs and 8 less INTs. He was also working with Adams, Lazard, MVS and Jake Kumerow opposed to Hopkins, Fuller and Stills."
2533,2020-03-10 15:54:18,fgfl6x,"Wait what is your criteria?

If it's player A vs next player B for 2019 why is Mack '17 and Watt 40 and Jones 41? Is this for 2019 only or does past performance matter? If not, Earl, Mosely, Cox and Hopkins aren't ranked well. Or Derwin. Where is Godwin?

Wagner is where he should be but the gap between him and the next best ILB is massive yet Leonard is at 18?

Also Austin Hooper is on this list?

OP I'm confused, who made this list and what is the ranking criteria? Like it's good that Tucker and Kern can make a list but everything else seems kind of odd."
2534,2020-03-10 17:38:22,fgfl6x,"Justin Tucker at 4 is accurate and reasonable, though."
2535,2020-03-10 16:15:21,fgfl6x,"4th best player in the NFL, confirmed"
2536,2020-03-10 15:43:11,fgfl6x,He was this season.
2537,2020-03-10 15:46:18,fgfl6x,"I love Julio, but MT and Hopkins have been the 1st team All-Pro WRs each of the past two seasons. It's hard to argue Julio above those two right now. Easily the 3rd best WR though, and that's still pretty damn good."
2538,2020-03-10 17:51:40,fgfl6x,Should be 1st tbh.
2539,2020-03-10 15:37:40,fgfl6x,"If you take into account positional value, the top 10 are probably all QBs. However, Mahomes and Wilson were almost unanimously picked over Lamar for QBs r/NFL would rather have right now, thus his relatively low ranking for an MVP.

edit: FWIW, the way these rankings work, you could essentially move Lamar all the way up to 11 without it changing his ranking as a QB."

2541,2020-03-10 17:22:54,fgfl6x,It's the off-season. Any content makes sense
2542,2020-03-10 16:37:15,fgfl6x,"I personally agree with you. I had Watson 5th on my QB list. I think what hurt Rodgers for other people is that he was compared to himself, instead of the other QBs. Rodgers had a ""down"" year compared to what we expect out of him."
2543,2020-03-10 16:42:20,fgfl6x,It's an aggregate list from a top 10 player poll at each position that OP has done for the last month. The poll was based off r/nfl's opinions
2544,2020-03-10 16:16:13,fgfl6x,Literally the chain above this is how this ranking isn‚Äôt about the previous season lol. Y‚Äôall need to make up your minds
2545,2020-03-10 15:43:55,fgfl6x,No he wasn‚Äôt. He had a HoF qb dumping 3 yard slants to him all game because he‚Äôs the only receiver on the saints.
2546,2020-03-10 17:27:13,fgfl6x,Lol Julio was robbed of 1st team all pro. He was better than Hop
2547,2020-03-11 00:15:25,fgfl6x,"Julio got robbed in 2018 by MT, 100% should‚Äôve been Julio and Nuk. Last year, he was robbed by Nuk, should‚Äôve been MT and Julio or MT and Godwin."
2548,2020-03-10 15:39:02,fgfl6x,i mean sure but even ignoring positional value...what past-MVP can you remember that wasn‚Äôt a top 10-15 player that season?
2549,2020-03-10 16:09:00,fgfl6x,People should @ you because you're wildly incorrect.
2550,2020-03-10 19:44:04,fgfl6x,Oh okay!

2552,2020-03-10 15:48:38,fgfl6x,"Well he accumulated over 300 more yards than Julio with those silly 3 yard slants, so....."
2553,2020-03-10 17:02:38,fgfl6x,"So is he bad because he was the only receiver Brees threw to, or is he good because the defense knew he was the only receiver Brees had and he still caught everything? Or does that just make the 13 defenses he faced have the combined IQ of a 4th grader for not making a competent gameplan to stop him?"

2555,2020-03-10 15:43:11,fgfl6x,When I did this [last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/c0criz/the_other_rnfl_top_101_players_list/) Mahomes was 24th.

2557,2020-03-10 18:09:59,fgfl6x,"He‚Äôs good, but catching these slants isn‚Äôt making him a top WR. Multiple receivers could do what he‚Äôs doing, they just have different QBs and they aren‚Äôt getting 10+ targets a game."
2558,2020-03-10 15:45:46,fgfl6x,"woah, I love me some Tom Brady, but you‚Äôre wilding if you think he was the best QB in 2018"

2560,2020-03-10 15:49:39,fgfl6x,I don't think you understand the process behind these numbers.
2561,2020-03-10 16:15:13,fgfl6x,IIRC this list last year was made after the main r/nfl list. Having Brady that high was probably an overcorrection.
2562,2020-03-10 15:49:38,fgfl6x,"Going into 2019, I don't think it's crazy that people thought he was the best QB. He had LeBron status after winning the Super Bowl ~~MVP~~ again where his regular season just doesn't matter, and people only judge him based on the playoffs. If Brady had made it to the AFC championship games this year, he'd probably still be considered a top 5 QB."
2563,2020-03-10 15:51:43,fgfl6x,it‚Äôs ranking players by how good they are at their position and ignoring positional value
2564,2020-03-10 16:01:42,fgfl6x,"He didn‚Äôt win SB MVP tho, Edelman did. But he was once again clutch when it mattered during the postseason"
2565,2020-03-10 16:00:47,fgfl6x,"Yeah but it‚Äôs not just taking into account the previous year it‚Äôs the opinion of where they stand at the moment as a player. And players with one impressive season tend to be ranked behind those that have been consistent over the last few years, even if that one season was MVP-worthy"
2566,2020-03-10 16:03:54,fgfl6x,"Good catch. But yeah the point remains the same. When a HOF QB wins the Super Bowl, he's gonna be ranked highly entering the following season."
2567,2020-03-10 16:06:25,fgfl6x,why rank Watson and Lamar over Rodgers and Brees if that‚Äôs the case?
2568,2020-03-10 16:10:39,fgfl6x,"Because they ‚Äútend to‚Äù, it‚Äôs not exact science. Also, the ranking came from poll results, it‚Äôs not OP that just decided to rank them like that"
2569,2020-04-21 05:42:47,g57iba,"I'd say he got his start on The Wire, as a kid he was very good as Wallace, but FNL was definitely a step towards Creed"
2570,2020-04-21 05:49:28,g57iba,"He and Director Ryan Coogler have a Robert De Niro/Scorsese type of relationship + friendship.

I feel like Coogler would have sought out MBJ even if he hadn't done FNL."
2571,2020-04-21 13:17:55,g57iba,"It is hard to say, unless Ryan Coogler has specifically said where he first noticed MBJ."
2572,2020-04-21 16:35:40,g57iba,I'd say he got his start on All My Children as Reggie üòÅ
2573,2020-04-22 01:08:31,g57iba,He was also on Parenthood. His performance in the wire you could tell he was something special. The wire are FNL are masterpieces

2575,2020-04-21 13:05:16,g57iba,As long as Coogler and Jordan did Fruitvale Station he would've put him in Creed.
2576,2020-04-21 18:28:22,g57iba,"It's nuts how many things he was apart of before I actually discovered him.

I first saw him in 'Chronicle,' where I thought he was fantastic.

I hadn't seen 'Friday Night Lights' yet, so it was a pleasant surprise to see him on the show."
2577,2020-04-25 00:40:37,g57iba,"He was pretty incredible on Parenthood. Even as annoying as Haddie was, he was good for her, made her grow up a lot. I‚Äôll have to watch the Wire."

2580,2020-04-20 18:41:50,g4y91v,"I won't say it's out of the question we go OL at 33, but it seems unlikely. All offseason our coaches and beat writers have been talking about the improvement in the OL over the last half of the season and basically how they're higher on the unit than most outsiders. Obviously could all be smokescreen but our team affiliated guys are usually on the nose with this stuff."
2581,2020-04-20 19:55:42,g4y91v,"For Tampa, i'd re-draft as:

1.21: Josh Jones, OT

2.45: D'Andre Swift, RB

2.53: Laviska Shenault, WR (bigger need than people think)

3.76: Matt Hennesey, iOL"
2582,2020-04-20 20:14:44,g4y91v,"Regarding the Vikings draft:

Solid round one. I could see them easily going that exact route. Fits our FO mentality, needs, and play styles.

Simpson in round two is bad, and I'm not talking from a value/evaluation standpoint. He does not have the skillset we look for nor need to succeed in our zone blocking system and is not someone we will likely be looking at for that reason, especially that early. Peart/Bartch/Jonah Jackson would have been better fits for OL.

I don't think we'd address CB that early again without addressing some other positions, but if we did, Robertson isn't a bad fit and we've met with him twice (combine and virtually) so there's interest there at the least. But Driscoll is not a good fit for us there. 

You managed to take two OL who would flop in our OL system unfortunately. That's the biggest mistake as the other three make sense from a fit perspective (even though not addressing DT or a second WR would be preferable to a second CB IMO)."
2583,2020-04-20 20:25:49,g4y91v,I don‚Äôt hate it for the lions but I wouldn‚Äôt be happy at all. I think if gross matos is there in the second we have to take him. We have passed up on edge for too long and Jamie Collins and Zach baun are to similar of players. I think taking a tackle when a interior rusher of gallimore‚Äôs potential is there after we just signed big V would be incredibly disappointing. We also need to draft a wide out relatively early and if Bryan Edwards is there at 85 I feel like we would have to take him
2584,2020-04-20 20:35:47,g4y91v,"Really don't like this at all for the Colts. Trading up for Pittman doesn't really make sense, especially when better WRs like Higgins and Aiyuk are still on the board, and Fromm is a big reach at 44. He's got possibly the lowest ceiling of all the QBs in the draft, and that's absolutely not worth spending a mid-2nd round pick on."
2585,2020-04-20 18:26:05,g4y91v,"I‚Äôd kill myself if this way the Jags draft. If we‚Äôre tanking for a QB, why waste a mid pick on one? Are we really gonna throw away Jawaan Taylor after one year for a worse prospect? Lol"
2586,2020-04-20 18:31:32,g4y91v,It‚Äôs hard to tell without it being numbered but it looks like you gave away a ravens second round pick without a trade.
2587,2020-04-20 18:32:37,g4y91v,"I have nothing against Reagor as the pick, I‚Äôd like for the Packers to take him, but knowing how that team drafts, I‚Äôd be absolutely STUNNED if they left Josh Jones on the board for Reagor at 30, only to reach on a different tackle 2 rounds later.

I know a lot of fan bases think theirs is going to avoid the player with off field concerns, but I can‚Äôt remember the last one the Packers drafted. I‚Äôd also be very surprised if they went with Gay in the 2nd. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs fit in the locker room with Z, Preston and ARod at all."
2588,2020-04-20 18:33:45,g4y91v,"I don't see Detroit drafting an OT early when they just signed a RT in FA, have Decker at LT, and Crosby as their swing tackle"
2589,2020-04-20 18:36:29,g4y91v,"I think the Pats need more than Kmet with how bad the offense was not just at TE. We currently lack any outside threat at WR and because of that teams just sat the middle of the field while double teaming Edelman and the rest of our guys drowned in man coverage. Pats need a guy with speed to line up outside who teams have to respect. Harry, Edelman, And Sanu aren‚Äôt those guys."
2590,2020-04-20 21:18:23,g4y91v,Isn't CJ Henderson the more linked name to Atlanta moving up rather than Kinlaw?
2591,2020-04-20 22:14:44,g4y91v,I don't think that's a reach for K'Von Wallace. Reggie Robinson on the other hand...

2600,2020-04-20 18:41:22,g4y91v,Taylor was pretty good for a rookie starting all 16 games with a trash can with a broken wheel as his guard. I don't know how you could plan on moving him.

2604,2020-04-20 19:21:09,g4y91v,"Right lol I don‚Äôt expect casual mock drafters to know everything, but when you open up with chastising statements like ‚Äúif you criticize back it up with some knowledge‚Äù then you can‚Äôt be making clown picks in your mock without backing it up"

2612,2020-04-19 18:09:13,g4c2ba,"Why does anyone do anything? Your life experiences have shaped your opinions and motivations such that you act in a certain way. There's no one ""black women"" entity that acts in unison. I imagine some women have issues with their self esteem, some dissociate themselves from the women who being disparaged, some will support an artist no matter what they do, some don't know what they've even said, etc etc. Depends on the person. 

But in general, racism and colorism are like an infection that permeates everyone on earth. Those artists who shit talk dark skinned women are infected with it, as are many of the women they're talking about and the women they're with. Putting blame on the people most hurt by it (""why do black women do this?? "") is another symptom of it."

Only it's us that have an imperative to outgrow that mindset, they don't really. 2. it's a power/status thing 3. makes them feel valued in a world that tells them they are second class, like it's a way to overcome their caste designation 4. I think these women don't really challenge them as much and treat them like they are some kind of trophy/prize. They eat it up, it feeds their egos."

2670,2020-04-16 21:02:43,g2k7s6,"I've watched every single one of his cut ups - New Meixco St, South Carolina, LSU, Auburn, Tennessee, Lafayette (2018), Texas A&M (2018) - and I can count on one hand how many times I saw a reception with some difficulty.

He can easily create separation with his speed and shows toughness but to me, there's not a lot more than him running away from people.  He's not the Tyreek Hill type of athlete - twitched up, muscular, compact - and he's more of a long strider a la Will Fuller.  I also question how he handles physicality.  He creates a lot of separation because of his speed but not as consistently as it should have been.  It also bothers me that he wasn't the WR2, let alone WR1, on that team (yes I understand the competition was stellar but we're still talking about a potential top 15 pick and the standard should be set high).

I like him a lot and think he adds a ton of value but I see more Will Fuller than a NFL WR1."
2671,2020-04-16 19:56:21,g2k7s6,"I watched Swift's 2018 before his 2019 season and thought he would be my locked in RB1 with an elite grade - Top 5 or Top 10.

I don't think this year was bad but you're right, it was missing the same type of jaw dropping games that he had in 2018 against Kentucky and Auburn.  

I think it's fair to factor in 2018 though while still downgrading him for his 2019.  It's possible that he knew he was entering the league soon and took his foot off the gas some."
2672,2020-04-16 20:13:48,g2k7s6,I wasn't expecting much when I started watching him but he blew me away.  Absolutely plays up to his testing numbers.

2676,2020-04-17 01:26:06,g2k7s6,"Using pro comparisons, I see Aiyuk as Chris Godwin and Ruggs as a healthy Will Fuller.

Aiyuk is more compact and muscular than Ruggs.  While Ruggs can easily separate using his speed, he‚Äôs more of a long strider and thus I don‚Äôt think he separates as consistently as he should.  I also think Ruggs struggles with physicality and I‚Äôm not sure how much he can change that with his build."

2679,2020-04-17 03:13:25,g2k7s6,Weaver is a really weird one.  I can see his production and watch him get sacks but I can‚Äôt tell you how he actually did it.  I don‚Äôt know how he wins in the NFL.  He‚Äôs not a speed rusher and he doesn‚Äôt have a ton of power.  His hand usage is pretty good but not fantastic.  I think he could have a long career as a rotational rusher but I‚Äôd rather take a chance on an upside guy at edge.

I just think there's so much to like. 

I'm a jets fan and would definitely rather see take a bigger bodied receiver, but think Ruggs is easily a top 3 wr talent in the class.

2685,2020-04-16 20:39:16,g2k7s6,"A big reason this is that the Offense was much less dynamic in 2019 than 2018, due to losing their top Pass catching options. They also decided it was a smart idea to run Swift on inside runs more than 50% of the time. They completely underutilized him in the passing game and did not fit the run scheme to his talents."

2689,2020-04-16 18:38:33,g2k7s6,he played so much better - Onwenu was benched from time to time
2690,2020-04-17 01:14:36,g2k7s6,Ok
2691,2020-04-17 15:09:54,g2k7s6,I just really disagree.
2692,2020-04-17 03:05:00,g2k7s6,"I don‚Äôt have the resources of an NFL scout or paid NFL draft analyst who is provided with the all 22 footage for every game.

However, in all the games I‚Äôve seen of Love accuracy wasn‚Äôt an issue.  He‚Äôs not the Josh Allen type with the huge arm and shotgun accuracy that can only throw fastballs.  He‚Äôs demonstrated great touch and can manipulate the velocity on his throws.

The main issue with Love is decision making, not accuracy.  I think that‚Äôs an important distinction as I‚Äôm not sure accuracy can be taught but decision making can to a degree."
2693,2020-04-17 03:07:01,g2k7s6,"To answer those PFF numbers, they aren‚Äôt specifically about inaccurate throws.  The 7 INTs include plays where he **misread coverages** and the 4.7% turnover plays isn‚Äôt limited to inaccurate throws either"
2694,2020-04-16 20:42:13,g2k7s6,"Appreciate the input, I don‚Äôt follow Georgia that closely but there was a noticeable difference between 18 and 19."
2695,2020-04-16 19:53:24,g2k7s6,It's hard to incorporate positional value when you're not making a board for a specific team.  It feels cleaner to me when I value a player against other players at his same position.
2696,2020-04-16 20:01:08,g2k7s6,"Round score for a lot of scouts seems to mean what kind of impact you should expect year 1, round 1 grade = immediate impact, plug and play starter. Round 2 = developmental/rotational player year 1 with potential for long term starter. Etc."
2697,2020-04-16 21:29:08,g2k7s6,Ya I messed up the rounding
2698,2020-04-16 18:40:40,g2k7s6,"I really, really disliked Bredeson (I watched Penn St and Alabama).

Really tiny arms (1%), balance issues and is on the ground a lot, bad anchor, troubles sticking on blocks, DL's who can use their hands kill him given his length problems.  The Alabama game was really atrocious.

I don't love Onwenu but he's a way more powerful player and his anchor is much better."
2699,2020-04-16 19:55:15,g2k7s6,"I mean, you do you I guess but shouldn‚Äôt you make it into a tier list instead of saying rounds then? Then it would be clear it doesn‚Äôt have to do with rounds in the draft and more defining cutoffs for guys."
2700,2020-04-16 20:03:22,g2k7s6,Have I been missing the point of round score this entire time? Do scouts really mean this? I always assumed it meant the projected round... Or what round they think they *should* go in..
2701,2020-04-16 20:12:42,g2k7s6,A numerical system would be best but the Round grades make sense as a proxy for me.
2702,2020-04-16 20:54:25,g2k7s6,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs universal at all. Just my personal experience from reading many people‚Äôs big boards and grades, then seeing their actual mock drafts where a 1st rounder falls a lot because of positional value."
2703,2020-04-16 20:14:09,g2k7s6,"Idk, I guess it works. 

I just personally think actual round makes a lot more sense. Or at least a caveat that that‚Äôs what it means. Or maybe I‚Äôm just dumb"
2704,2020-04-16 20:58:15,g2k7s6,Are you sure it‚Äôs not more like ‚ÄúPlayer X has a first round grade‚Äù but on the big board he‚Äôs 40th because on a ‚Äúnormal year‚Äù he slots in the fourth round but since there‚Äôs more talent in the first round this year he falls? Instead of falling due to positional value?
2705,2020-04-15 20:25:54,g1zvu2,"Genlock had to prove itself and was partially funded by MBJs studio I believe. 

Rwby is established and there's limited business reasons to push more budget into something that's probably not going to see much return on it."
2706,2020-04-15 20:30:34,g1zvu2,"[Crunchyroll is going by things watched on Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2019/12/31/decade-in-review-the-most-watched-anime-of-the-decade-by-country), I don't think RWBY is overall as large as the image makes it out to be.
>[...] watched RWBY, an American-made series, more than anything else. While a big part of this is the fact that most anime viewing in Japan doesn‚Äôt happen on Crunchyroll, the viewership of RWBY in Japan is actually quite impressive."
2707,2020-04-15 21:47:43,g1zvu2,"The way I see it (emphasis on I) is that RWBY is by far RT's most loved franchise next to RvB, a show that still spends most of its runtime using game engine mechanics. RvB is still deeply cared for in terms of passion from the RT staff and the same goes for RWBY with CRWBY still being THE overseers of the project with each volume whereas Gen:LOCK is now an HBO based show before RT releases it themselves.

I always saw Gen:LOCK as a way to sell a show to a network. Something to get RT on a more steady network rather than relying on YouTube and their own website. Yes, a lot of care went into that show...but I'd argue that was mostly from Gray, who said this was a passion project for him (much like RWBY was for Monty though I'm not 100% sure if that's a fair comparison or not), and Michael B. Jordan who's studio helped fund this project. I'd argue RT used this opportunity not just to have a new IP, but to have something they can guarantee profit off of in order to support the rest of their endeavors on the RT site. 

So I'd say RT definitely cares about RWBY, a show that has remained RT true for 7 years and will continue to at least Volume 12. The writers have passion and the animators bring it to life. It may not have the highest budget, but that is not always a sign of care. Plus who knows? Maybe this Gen:LOCK/HBO deal will give RWBY more room to play with (as well as bring back shows that could get revived like Camp Camp, Nomad of Nowhere, RWBY Chibi...or at least one of them)"
2708,2020-04-15 21:06:43,g1zvu2,"As others said v6 was as long as gen:Lock S1. 

 gen:lock was also supposed to be a ""premium"" series, behind a paywall, potentially making more than RWBY ever could as it's only behind a paywal for a limited time. 

Then there's the fact that Michael B Jordan also put monetary support into the project. If he never showed interest in the series (contacting him for the role of Julian was a long shot) they never would've been able to get Maisie Williams and David Tenant. 

The big names also helps to sell the series to other networks. 

They put a lot of money into their next potential big series, because they wanted it to succeed. Now they've moved the series to another platform, because they can't fund it by themselves. 

The fact that RWBY is still 100% in-house is the only way we can measure how much RWBY means to the company. When they sell move it to another platform, that's when you can try make that claim."
2709,2020-04-15 21:03:16,g1zvu2,"Genlock's budget came from pillaging the whole rest of the animation department at the expense of pretty much every other show, in addition to all the crunch culture of unpaid overtime and other *dubious* labor practices that essentially meant that work got done for no budget at all."
2710,2020-04-15 21:17:06,g1zvu2,[deleted]
2711,2020-04-16 02:01:29,g1zvu2,One of the appeals of RWBY is the diverse range of experience of the voice actors and to hear them grow. Even though the voice actors in Gen:lock were professionals the only ones that struck a chord with me was David Tennant and Maisie Williams. For RWBY many of the voice actors stand out.
2712,2020-04-15 20:25:43,g1zvu2,"Rwby volume 6 is as long as gen:LOCK season 1...
Volume 5 is even 15 minutes longer than gen:LOCK and V6."
2713,2020-04-16 06:23:58,g1zvu2,"Chinese game got shut down.

And they care about money."
2714,2020-04-15 20:27:13,g1zvu2,pretty much this.
2715,2020-04-15 20:34:29,g1zvu2,">In that case, Rooster Teeth's interest in Rwby is not much.

Rwby has good results, it was very popular in Japan Crunchyroll."
2716,2020-04-15 20:39:04,g1zvu2,"Still, having Rwby the most watched is something."
2717,2020-04-15 22:26:30,g1zvu2,"Yes I understand.
Could RT try something like this with Rwby?
Keeping the IP, try moving to a larger studio or a different Stream.
Rwby is very potential."
2718,2020-04-15 21:20:45,g1zvu2,"I didn't know that detail about Michael B. Jordan.

I don't know yet, after what AmericanCataphract said¬†¬†And all the effort in Gen: lock to just change platforms, what about profit sharing? Why not use these resources in a 100% internal work."
2719,2020-04-15 21:30:40,g1zvu2,"I don't know, Rwby has problems with writing, Rooster Teeth doesn't seem to care or bother,give a budget to the Rwby team and that's it."
2720,2020-04-15 20:32:52,g1zvu2,gen:LOCK is actually about an hour longer.
2721,2020-04-16 14:26:00,g1zvu2,"Yes, but the name Rwby reached China."
2722,2020-04-15 20:52:10,g1zvu2,"Yeah.

Because Crunchyroll Japan has *nowhere* near as much to watch on it as Crunchyroll America, and that was accounting for the entire decade including RWBY's brief boom in interest in Japan. Crunchyroll was the easiest way to watch it besides Nico Nico."
2723,2020-04-16 07:45:11,g1zvu2,"The minute they move it to a larger studio they lose creative control over it. The minute they sell distribution rights to another company, they lose control over that as well.

RWBY is RT's baby. They're not going to give that kind of stuff up."
2724,2020-04-15 22:23:20,g1zvu2,"They cancelled chibi, and a couple other animated shows because of crunch. If they didn't care about RWBY, it would have been on the chopping block as well."
2725,2020-04-15 20:35:24,g1zvu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/genlock/comments/azsqhx/actual_episode_lengths/?utm_source=amp&utm_medium=&utm_content=post_body
2726,2020-04-15 21:33:40,g1zvu2,You sure about that? My [math](https://www.reddit.com/r/genlock/comments/azsqhx/actual_episode_lengths/) says otherwise (literally within a second of each other).
2727,2020-04-16 05:47:50,g1zvu2,"there's also (unsurprisingly) a lot of other ways to watch anime in Japan, so 'Crunchyroll popularity' is a bit less of a meaningful metric over there."
2728,2020-04-15 20:57:15,g1zvu2,"Hey, I'm in that thread, I still stand by what I said :)"
2729,2020-04-15 20:36:48,g1zvu2,I was just running off of base numbers. Didn't know someone had already done all the actual math.
2730,2020-04-15 21:37:55,g1zvu2,I was running off of officially listed runtimes. I did not go and record the timestamps of every episode and remove the credits and ads.
2731,2020-04-15 20:54:18,g1zvu2,Glad you spoke with authority then
2732,2020-04-15 21:44:09,g1zvu2,"If you used the crappy reddit searchbar to look for the word ""runtime"" on the subreddit, this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RWBY/comments/azsr5z/v6_and_genlock_had_the_same_runtime/) is the third result, which would have been even easier than adding up the runtimes."

2792,2020-04-09 10:15:40,fxpwxc,But would rainbow 6 have enough lore for a full length story? It's an awesome idea but I feel like there wouldn't be much to do.
2793,2020-04-09 11:27:48,fxpwxc,With a game like siege that is kind of built off of lore I would love to see a movie/tv series about it.
2794,2020-04-09 10:26:33,fxpwxc,"I was thinking that too but they can be pretty creative as seen with the Outbreak event and even the new operators and the gadgets/abilities. And every operator has a backstory, which then leads to maybe the map they're on and the maps history. They are a really creative group of people so there's a lot that can be done if you think about it."
2795,2020-04-09 10:27:48,fxpwxc,Fair point. And there is also the books too.
2796,2020-04-09 12:56:30,fxpwxc,The books have nigh zero connection to the books which is sad because there was a fair bit of potential there
2797,2020-04-08 19:18:11,fxcq8v,"I don't see how a move termed ""No-Brainer"" warrants a B+ grade, for a talent such as Jokic, who is a top 5 player on the offensive end. As well, Denver has not tanked, once in the last 15 years. They have fielded competitive squads throughout and built along the fringes with a huge trump card in MPJ that alters that ceiling drastically.

Your grade is far too low, IMHO"
2798,2020-04-08 19:17:30,fxcq8v,"They acquired a fun young star, and other fun compliments around him. Put a coach in there that put in a system that capitalized on their altitude advantage and fits the youth they‚Äôve got. 

The Murray contract isn‚Äôt amazing, but it‚Äôs not like they were getting a free agent pg to come to Denver. 

I like their front office."
2799,2020-04-08 20:10:55,fxcq8v,You're being deliberately negative with most of your grades and have some wishy-washy logic about judging the transactions based on the information they had at the time vs. in hindsight.
2800,2020-04-08 19:17:13,fxcq8v,Their recent moves have been kinda questionable but overall they have been amazing and would be much better in Chicago then GarPax

1) they overvalue their own young players 
2) ownership historically isn‚Äôt willing to pay luxury tax"
2803,2020-04-08 19:24:17,fxcq8v,"I think it's interesting how little they got out of juancho and Beasley.  They seem to have held onto them a bit too long , you should be able to get more than a late first (and a mediocre prospect like KBD) out of 2 guys like that"
2804,2020-07-08 13:15:31,fxcq8v,idk but fuck kroenke
2805,2020-04-08 20:07:35,fxcq8v,"their moves have been a mixed bag. 

Barton's contract is actually awful. he was one of the worst players in the league last year according to just about every advanced stat, and had one of the worst playoffs of all time. his contract was so awful this offseason that the Grizzlies wouldn't take it even with a 1st for Iguoudala, and the reason why they had to sell Beasley for the pennies on the dollar. he had some redeeming play at the beginning of the year, but has been the worst player on the team for the second half this season. just look up any Nuggets game thread.

nuggets astroturf social media and control the teams subreddit so criticism will usually appear to be ""unpopular"""
2806,2020-04-08 19:34:44,fxcq8v,Yeah if anything ‚Äúno-brainers‚Äù should just warrant pass/fail status instead of a letter grade when you realistically have one option anyway

I wouldn‚Äôt give the Lakers an a for signing LeBron and I wouldn‚Äôt give the pels an a for drafting Zion.

2808,2020-04-08 19:28:22,fxcq8v,I agree
2809,2020-04-08 19:18:23,fxcq8v,Have to agree with you there. I might not be all the way at amazing though
2810,2020-04-08 20:45:33,fxcq8v,Says the guy who thinks CJ is a negative player for the blazers?
2811,2020-04-08 20:06:25,fxcq8v,"KBD and Juancho are the same age and have had similarly lackluster careers (and that's coming from a big Juancho fan). Beasley had one year out of four thus far where he's looked like a decent NBA player; getting a late first for him is perfectly fair.

&#x200B;

Judging this trade off a couple of hot shooting weeks from Juancho and Beasley is silly."
2812,2020-04-08 19:27:45,fxcq8v,Yea.. you guys did great though! Two young prospects and basically a lottery pick

2843,2020-04-05 06:26:55,fv8pox,"Captain America the winter soldier has some of the best hand to hand fight scenes you have to admit... tbh it's the best 2nd movie when looking at the mcu trilogy's of iron man, thor, avengers and of course caps."
2844,2020-04-05 05:46:24,fv8pox,"With such a generally low opinion, why in the world would you watch 20 plus of them?"
2845,2020-04-05 05:44:06,fv8pox,"I can say with confidence that you're ratings are different than what I usually see.

People generally like Iron Man more than Thor.

And marvels fans wouldn't hesitate to give Infinity War and Endgame 5/5 stars.

But hey ,you like whatever you like man."
2846,2020-04-05 05:42:22,fv8pox,Stopped reading after seeing you have Thor 1 higher score than Iron Man 1 AND Winter Soldier.

2849,2020-04-05 06:37:19,fv8pox,"Spider-Man homecoming was trash. Worst version of Spider-Man. Totally ignored the core aspects of Spider-Man's character. The horribly dated CGI, the clunky dialogue and annoying side characters were the icing on this turd.

Iron Man 3 was also overhyped. Very weak villain and end credits of Tony's operation was really dumb. Completely bastardized the extremis suit and story.

Winter Soldier, first Avenger and iron man 1 were great though."
2850,2020-04-05 06:56:44,fv8pox,"I feel like the only reason this post exists is to start a fight against Marvel fans. 

Luckily nobody cares if it‚Äôs not your kind of movie. We all have our opinions we‚Äôre entitled to."
2851,2020-04-05 05:53:33,fv8pox,"Thor the dark World 1 star, it doesn't deserve 2. As a matter of fact it should be removed from marvel canon if you ask me, they should replace it and brush it off as time manipulation


Also iron man 1 is a 5 star movie. It was originally designed to be stand alone, but became the beginning and even was referenced in the end of iron man's story

I agree with most of your other ratings give or take .75 stars"

2853,2020-04-05 05:53:20,fv8pox,I take it you didn‚Äôt read any of these comic books? I know you said a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person but is that what you meant? ‚ÄòCause you and other haters of these films critique them like film critics that are watching an Oscar nominated movie.
2854,2020-04-05 07:11:51,fv8pox,"I'm curious.  With the ratings you provided,  based on your tastes.  What were the movies you recommended?"
2855,2020-04-05 06:47:31,fv8pox,">I liked how Iron Man was more grounded and wasn‚Äôt just a green screen mess.

Yeah. It felt like they put more effort into everything including the CGI. Also, I think a lot of the suit was an actual prop rather than CGI hence the stark difference in the suits between iron man 1 and something like civil war."
2856,2020-04-05 06:20:57,fv8pox,I think from the comments it‚Äôs clear I need to rewatch the first iron man.
2857,2020-04-05 06:31:30,fv8pox,This is a good point. The fights between Captain America and the Winter Soldier were entertaining. What would you say the best is?
2858,2020-04-05 05:57:48,fv8pox,"Have you been outside lately?

Yeah, thought so.

Also these movies are so far up their own asses you need to watch all 20 of then for it to make sense."
2859,2020-04-05 06:20:16,fv8pox,Did you read the preamble? The explanation of why I watched them is right there.
2860,2020-04-05 06:18:22,fv8pox,Awesome
2861,2020-04-05 06:17:34,fv8pox,I could be wrong about iron man 1. I may have to rewatch it. It was 20 movies ago... but winter soldier didn‚Äôt really stand out for me and infinity war was not worth the hype.
2862,2020-04-05 07:03:22,fv8pox,"That's silly,He/She gave their review/opinion of some MCU movies,The only people who would start a fight over someone else's opinion are stupid."

Only a MCU fanboy could get so triggered by someone criticizing these movies. OP gave his opinion, you can disagree with it. But outrageous claims like these only make the MCU fans seem more childish and stupid."
2864,2020-04-05 06:18:08,fv8pox,Haha agreed on the Thor dark world. It was baaaad. Might have to watch iron man 1 again.

2870,2020-04-05 17:45:09,fv8pox,I loved the highway fight scene. The knife skills were unreal.
2871,2020-04-05 07:06:28,fv8pox,"Correct! And nobody should be stupid enough to fight anyones opinion.

I‚Äôm just saying OP only made this post to do exactly that, and OP isn‚Äôt gonna get it."
2872,2020-04-05 06:24:30,fv8pox,You‚Äôre not hating but you gave them all less than 4stars. What are you comparing them to? On a scale of 5 stars I presume? I think if you read the comics or had actual interest in them your critiques would differ greatly.
2873,2020-04-05 07:37:43,fv8pox,"I've seen many of these.  My opinion is they rate equal to the marvel movies. Still,  we all have our preferences.  I still need to watch these others,  just to broaden my movie experiences."
2874,2020-04-05 07:42:37,fv8pox,Wasn't taking it that way! Its just a long way back is all!
2875,2020-04-05 07:07:30,fv8pox,But how do you know that's the reason they did it?Maybe they wanted to give their opinion about the movies and get some feedback
2876,2020-04-05 06:32:31,fv8pox,I‚Äôm not comparing them to anything. The stars are an opinion on how I liked the movies. Yes on a scale of 5. Which would you rate 4 or above?
2877,2020-04-05 07:41:28,fv8pox,That‚Äôs what he was asking for. To broaden his movie base.
2878,2020-04-05 10:36:22,fv8pox,Thanks for the defence kind stranger. You are right I wasn‚Äôt trying to pick a fight about it.
2879,2020-04-05 07:22:31,fv8pox,">This movie was a bloated, sloppy end to an average four movies. You wanna fuck with time travel, get it right marvel you surely have the budget to do it

I don‚Äôt think anyone would say this if they had legitimate intentions to have a friendly conversation about movies. 

This whole post was designed to subtly attack a fanbase. But legit, it‚Äôs fine. Nobody is gonna get mad."
2880,2020-04-05 07:10:51,fv8pox,"I get that but what kind of movie do you consider a 4 or above? That‚Äôs what I meant by my question. How can you give a list of movies all rated less than 4 stars and not tell us what you consider a better movie? It makes me think you‚Äôre a hater. My opinion is biased as I read and collect comics. I personally LOVE all of them with the exception of Iron Man 3. I‚Äôm the type of person who appreciates art on every level. In comics, the stories get passed down to new artists and writers. They‚Äôre given the reigns so to speak and change the way the given hero looks and acts and the story is theirs to play with. With Marvel approval of course but the ideas stem from the new artists in control of those new ideas. I loved reading through different phases of a Heroes history in comics. I consider the films the same way. They‚Äôre the same characters I know and love with their stories being told through a new artists perspective. It‚Äôs a bit of an honor to see it done in film. The plot holes are endless in comics and are, when compared to actual literature as great authors, like The Art of War, Lord of the Rings, Steven King, Anne Rice, Mark Twain or any other type of great literature or authors, comics fail in comparison of course. From my perspective, these movies are simply an honor to watch in live action. The MCU actually gave a shit about putting the movies together like a saga. Especially when compared to the previous crappy movies that were far worse made by Hollywood strictly for profit purposes. Stan Lee, RIP, new when he went bankrupt back in the day he was selling the rights left and right to keep the company afloat and get more exposure at the same time. I always get downvotes when I call people haters for overtly criticizing the films but I don‚Äôt care. From my POV these movies are gift. Fuck the critics. Real comic book fans are why these movies even exist. Thank you to all the people who make comic book movies. Especially to the ones who care when they make them. This type of storytelling is unprecedented in Hollywood. A saga told through multiple franchises is not easy. I think they did fucking great."
2881,2020-04-05 10:39:30,fv8pox,"Sure. Cherry pick a comment to support your view. 

I gave credit where it was due and I stand by my criticisms. 

After spending hours on the avengers movies it was, for me, a frustrating conclusion. My sentiments echoed this frustration."
2882,2020-04-05 07:40:12,fv8pox,"Did you want a list of movies that i think are 4 and above? Generally for me to consider something 4 and above it needs to be shot well, have great acting/script/story, and at the end i want it to make me feel something. I posted this list in another comment. I consider these all 4 stars and above:

The Silence of the Lambs, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Shining, In Bruges, There Will be Blood, Children of Men, Lost in Translation The Lobster, Memories of Murder, Pulp Fiction, The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Departed, Revolutionary Road, The Nice Guys, Amelie, Full Metal Jacket, In the Mood for Love, The Master, The Farewell, Back to the Future Trilogy (to name a few)

I read comics too friend, From Hell is hands down an excellent read for any literature, classic or otherwise. I think i generally prefer DC Comics to Marvel ones, but outside of Nolan's Batman, the DC Movies I've seen are terrible."
2883,2020-04-05 11:27:14,fv8pox,That‚Äôs fine if you didn‚Äôt like it but don‚Äôt pass off insults as criticism.
2884,2020-04-05 07:57:33,fv8pox,"See, that‚Äôs my point. You‚Äôre comparing and not realizing it. I say that because you use the same rating system for them. I like everyone of the movies you mentioned. They‚Äôre great but compared to MCU films I can see why you give them that score and the MCU ones less than 4. It‚Äôs unfair IMO. Comic book movies shouldn‚Äôt be rated along with other great films like that. They‚Äôll always fail in comparison."
2885,2020-04-05 08:29:43,fv8pox,Interesting point. I can‚Äôt say I agree specifically. I don‚Äôt weight my ratings compared to other movies I have seen. But I do rate as my personal tastes and preferences go. But let‚Äôs agree to disagree. It‚Äôs been fun.

I've watched almost everything he's been in, but I don't see any real range. He gets cast in great films, and some duds, but his actual role never really does anything for me.

The only character acting that really did something for me was his work in The Wire. Everything since his twenties has been a lot of the same character."

2918,2020-04-05 04:06:34,fv13yo,"You're actually right, he's a personality. He has A-list presence, and that's what everyone recognized in Fruitvale Station."
2919,2020-04-05 16:37:34,fv13yo,"A couple of things: 

In that case, it does look like more people agree than disagree that what you wrote was a bad take. So you weren't spot on. You also start off with an unclever dig that I think you thought was a good comeback and put down ‚Äî but it's just not? So my mind gets blown, regardless of the situation, so I'm in a constant state of awe? Or, you're saying that your take was spot on, so it must be easy to blow my mind because you were spot on? How is that even a putdown? I'm constantly wowed? Or I'm so stupid, so everything is mindblowing? 

Here's then why I think you're wrong, which I suppose I could have written some of before, but now have a few minutes of time for (I guess this is a little long as well): 

1) there's just a massive gulf of difference between Michael B. Jordan and actors like Tom Cruise and Harrison Ford, both in terms of their ability to act ‚Äî to create characters that audiences connect with on an emotional level ‚Äî and in terms of their screen presence as movie stars. Perhaps you are making that comparison, looking at both of those actors through the lens of their more recent selves where they've starred in a number of films that lean on their particular 'movie star persona', but even so it doesn't quite work. Both Cruise and Ford's careers are littered with roles that exemplify their ability as actors and unique movie star presences, of which Jordan does not have and has yet to show. There's a reason why Cruise and Ford are, well, Cruise and Ford ‚Äî because their role as movie stars is underlined by a very real ability and mastery of acting. It's what separates them from other movie stars and has given them careers that are now well into five decades for Ford and four decades for Cruise. 

You would only have to watch each actor's courtroom drama films ‚Äî Just Mercy for Jordan, Presumed Innocent for Ford, and The Firm and A Few Good Men for Cruise ‚Äî for examples of the difference. 

Simply put, your take is a bad take because it's reductive and wrong. You hired and still hire people like Cruise and Ford both because of their presence, *and* because of their talent and mastery of the craft of acting. That's what separates them from being just 'watchable' movie stars. Even on a movie star level, it's wrong ‚Äî Jordan definitely has presence, but at nowhere near the same extent. 

2) You connect having unique quirks with being good acting, which is also wrong. If that were the case, then, for instance, Brad Pitt in 12 Monkeys is a better performance than him in Ad Astra, Moneyball, or Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, or Gary Oldman in The Fifth Element is a better performance than him in Tinker, Tailor Soldier, Spy or Darkest Hours. Or Willem Dafoe in Boondock Saints is better than his performance in The Florida Project. Giving a character quirks does not make good acting.  

3) And not sure what exactly you mean by deep text reading, and how unique character quirks exactly enable that? It doesn't. So in that way, I suppose you're also wrong."
2920,2020-04-05 02:54:21,fv13yo,If they made this in the 80s or early 90s you could pull off Russia or Vietnam again. All these terrorist conflict zones just don't have the same feel.
2921,2020-04-05 19:19:11,fv13yo,"What makes it a bad take isn‚Äôt necessarily the idea that he has that movie star presence, but everything else that‚Äôs implied there."
2922,2020-04-04 19:31:49,fux36b,"Love guys like you who put in the work, thanks."
2923,2020-04-04 17:08:37,fux36b,"I would bump Tua to top 5 and Eason to round 2 but other than that I couldn‚Äôt agree more on your QB rankings. Low on Herbert myself, a much bigger fan of Jordan Love"
2924,2020-04-04 19:53:08,fux36b,"I'd like to know what tape you saw of Baun looking 'natural' in coverage, because he might be the most useless coverage guy ive seen projected in his range in the last few years."
2925,2020-04-05 02:02:46,fux36b,I just want to ask because I've seen this with a few people. I like Love but what does he do better than Herbert? I think they both have boom or bust potential but Herbert just seems like a more polished version of Love.
2926,2020-04-05 01:05:35,fux36b,Just gotta ask...why so low on Mims?
2927,2020-04-05 01:46:45,fux36b,Did you mean Julian Blackmon from Utah?
2928,2020-04-04 20:31:51,fux36b,He looks natural playing in space generally.  I dont think he has a big transition to make to a SAM rush LB.
2929,2020-04-05 02:09:27,fux36b,"He plays out of structure.  You see a lot more wow throws with Love or plays where everything‚Äôs going against him and he has to make a play.

With Herbert, it‚Äôs a ton of easy reads and throws without a lot required on his part."
2930,2020-04-06 16:48:14,fux36b,"Not OP, but Love can make decisions quicker than Herbert. While not always the right read (sometimes just a bad read and sometimes due to his poor supporting cast/play calling) I saw a lot less plays on film where Love was holding onto the ball too long. Just for example, against Cal Herbert had a seam route butt naked but he wasn‚Äôt able to pull the trigger fast enough and allowed the safety to get there and pick off the ball. I see a lot more plays where Love is able to fit the ball in a tight window on time than Herbert. I see a lot of Jacoby Brissett in Herbert and think he will struggle to make plays in the NFL due to being gun shy. He‚Äôs a slow processor"
2931,2020-04-05 01:23:17,fux36b,"He needs a decent amount of work - right now he‚Äôs just size, great hands/contested catches, and combine testing.  I didn‚Äôt think he played how he tested and didn‚Äôt really explode out of his breaks.

The size + athletic ability + strong hands are really intriguing though."
2932,2020-04-05 02:10:02,fux36b,Ya fucked that one up

I was wondering why you think Love is so much better than Herbert. I have Herbert higher, and most do as well, but I wanted to hear your reasoning."
2936,2020-04-03 00:59:13,ftw75d,Do you mind expanding on why Henry Ruggs is your WR6?

2938,2020-04-03 01:48:22,ftw75d,"It's clear you haven't watched any tape on Ruggs at all.

""Struggles with physicality and doesn't offer a lot more than speed.""

- great hands , very physical with ball in his hands, great at contested catches. A good blocker to . He plays bigger than he is.

I'm a Lamb homer , but I think Ruggs could be first WR off the board."
2939,2020-04-03 00:06:44,ftw75d,"Both have similarly great physical tools but Herbert is extremely methodical to me.  He had easy, defined reads and I thought he struggled when forced to improvise and under pressure.

Of course Love has his own set of issues regarding processing his reads and decision making but given his awful situation this year I'm willing to forgive some of it.

I'd rather have the QB that needs to be a little more conservative than the one I'm not sure can operate out of structure."
2940,2020-04-03 01:19:06,ftw75d,I like him a lot but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a well rounded WR right now.  I saw lots of gos and crossers and in all the games I watched I saw 3 contested catches.  Doesn‚Äôt mean he can‚Äôt do just I haven‚Äôt seen it.
2941,2020-04-04 05:42:17,ftw75d,What makes Akers a bad fit in the NFL?
2942,2020-04-03 02:20:58,ftw75d,I‚Äôve watched every Ruggs cut up available.  We can both watch the film and come to a different conclusion.
2943,2020-04-03 00:30:42,ftw75d,Yeah that makes sense. You think Love is closer to his 2018 tape than his 2019?
2944,2020-04-04 12:42:58,ftw75d,"Lack of value in the pass game. High drop rate, I think the low volume is due to the fact the staff didn't believe he deserved more. Not the best pass blocker. Beyond that, he lacks vision between the tackles. He's a home run threat which is great, but you can't make an every down back out of that."
2945,2020-04-03 15:02:48,ftw75d,um
2946,2020-04-04 12:51:03,ftw75d,"I completely disagree about him lacking value in the pass game and I think that‚Äôs one of his strengths. 

How is he a low volume passer catcher?  He had 30 catches this year.  Plus he actually received a pretty high % of his teams targets at 10.4%.

I didn‚Äôt notice any drop issues watching him so I‚Äôd be curious what his drop numbers are.

Regarding pass blocking, he needs work just like 95% of all college RBs but he shows the willingness to do it which is sufficient for me.

The vision issues I agree with, however, I have a hard time knowing how much of that is on him vs the awful OL"
2947,2020-04-03 15:03:45,ftw75d,*2019 my bad. Edited
2948,2020-04-04 13:10:50,ftw75d,"Man I just looked at his numbers and you're dead on. I had in my head that he had less than 20 career catches in college? I don't know where I got that... I'll have to revisit some of that stuff. 

I think his drop rate was 8% but that's off memory."

* 2000 Shaq
* 2004 Garnett (in a vacuum prefer 2003 Duncan, but Garnett is more versatile on the greatest roster ever assembled)
* 2009 Lebron (obviously his passing improves later on, but this team is still good at ball movement, and I highly value his athletic peak)
* 2016/17 Curry (criticisms of Wade clogging the paint are fair, and I want to manage usage better than Kobe would allow)
* 2007 Nash (gambling that this raises the offence‚Äôs ceiling by more than it lowers the defence‚Äôs floor)

Bench:

* 2003 Duncan
* 2020 Giannis (closest possible analogue to Garnett)
* 2017 Kawhi (assuming he is not injured, this is like a diet analogue of 2009 Lebron; if counting injury, either 2016 or 2019 are fine depending on what you want)
* 2008 Kobe
* 2015 Paul (athletic peak in 2008, but better passer, defender, and shooter here, which is what this team needs as the main back-up to Nash and without taking a better passing Lebron year)
* + 2009 Wade
* + 2011 Dirk

Condolences to McGrady and Durant.

Bench:

* + 1960 Pettit (consequence of the era that this team is heavy on bigs, but I would rather have the additional talent offered by this than by throwing in Bob Cousy just because he is a guard)

And then...

* 1993/94 Hakeem
* 1997 KMalone
* 1986 Bird
* 1991/92 Jordan
* 1987 Magic

Bench:

* 1995 Robinson (offensive concerns less relevant on a stacked team, much like Garnett, and obviously works well next to centre-esque power forwards)
* 1983 Moses
* 1990 Barkley
* 1995 Reggie
* 1985 Isiah (trusting him over Stockton in a do-or-die situation)
* + 1990 Ewing (similar issue with overabundance of centres; condolences to 1999 Mourning)
* + 1994/95 Pippen (also considered Hill and Penny, but wanted defence over offence here)"
2951,2020-04-02 21:38:20,ftu6mu,"Great write up!  I like your team better than Simmons especially moving LeBron to point guard and starting Kawhi over Kobe which makes that team bigger, longer, and better defensively than Simmons.

I know Wade's 2009 season was fantastic but I would still put CP3 as the back guard and I would rather have Hardens best year over Wade's.  From a fit perspective on this super all star team I would rather have Klay also over Wade. I know Wade is a good slasher, and brings alot to the table, but if I'm the Aliens I'm sagging off Wade hard and letting him shoot as many 3s and long jumpers as he pleases.  Basically, Klay off the ball > Wade off the ball.  I don't think Wade is good enough in this scenario to be one of the main ball handlers so I would move CP3 to the backup guard spot and then put Klay as my 11th man and leave Wade off the team."

Trae Young's overall is low at 63. That should be raised.  
DeAndre Hunter was traded from the Lakers, not the Pelicans  
Kemba Walker was in a sign and trade from Charlotte to Boston, not signed in free agency. Terry Rozier was also in that trade.  
Jayson Tatum is playing 89% at PF. He's not a SF.  
Marcus Smart is playing 23% at PG and 73% at SG. I know its not the 25% threshold, but he plays PG when Kemba is off the court.  
Semi Ojeleye was born in Overland Park, not Ottawa  
Chris Chiozza deserves a boost. He's been playing more backup PG minutes now that Kyrie is out.  
Kevin Durant was in a sign and trade, not a free agent signing.  
Lower Nicolas Batum's rating. He was bad in the 22 games he played this year.  
Adam Mokoka deserves a slight boost. He's been good in the G League this year and has also played in 11 games.  
Bismack Biyombo was traded from Orlando, not Oklahoma City. His free throw rating should be lowered as well. Plus, his college should be changed to Spain because that's where he was playing before joining the NBA.  
Matthew Dellevadova's dunking should be way lower. He's yet to make a dunk in the NBA. Also lower his 3pt shooting, he's shooting 23% from the 3 on 91 attempts.  
Kristaps Porzingis is a FC now. He's been playing 69% at PF and 31% at C.  
Lower Michael Kidd-Gilchrist's overall  
Lower Bruce Brown's overall. Joke's over lol  
Dragan Bender is still on the Warriors  
Klay Thompson is only playing 13% at SF. Probably should change him back to a SG. Also should raise his defense and get rid of Stephen Curry's Perimeter Defense badge.  
Andrew Wiggins should be a SF. He's only played 12% at SG and that's only going to go down while he plays in Golden State.  
Draymond Green should be a PF. His SF minutes are going to drop with Wiggins. Also should lower his overall.  
Lower William Howard's overall. He's on a two-way contract and is a 50 overall.  
Move Patrick Beverley to PG. The only time he ever played a high percentage of SG minutes was in 2017-18 when he only played 11 games. Also give him the Perimeter Defense badge.  
Move Landry Shamet to SG. I don't even know why he's guard, he's never played at PG 20% of the time.  
Move Reggie Jackson to PG. The last time he's played there 20% of the time was back in 2014-15.  
It might just be me, but JaMychal Green's overall is pretty high.  
Kyle Anderson is a FC. He's been playing 62% at PF and 24% at C.  
Jae Crowder is a F. He's been playing both SF and PF for the last 2 years.  
Andre Iguodala's contract lasts until 2022, not 2021.  
George Hill is playing 87% at PG. Also raise his 3pt shooting, he's shooting 48% from 3.  
Lower D.J. Wilson's overall  
Lower Josh Okogie's overall  
Jordan McLaughlin still deserves a bit of a raise  
Move Jrue Holiday to SG. He's been playing there 61% of the time. Please don't make him a GF, he's only 6'3"".  
Move J.J. Redick to G. He's been playing 31% at PG and 60% at SG.

Raise Devin Booker's overall  
Cheick Diallo is a C. He's playing there 82% of the time. Also, lower his overall, specifically his defensive IQ.  
Raise De'Aaron Fox's overall a little bit  
Lower Serge Ibaka's overall

Lower R.J. Hampton. He's not a top 5 pick.  
Lower Aleksej Pokusevski. He's a new prospect to me and from what I'm hearing, he's around 10-14 on most big boards.  
Raise Tyrese Haliburton. He's a projected top 5 pick.  
Raise Killian Hayes a little bit. He's also a projected top 5 pick.  
Lower Jahmi'us Ramsey. He's a projected late first round pick.  
Raise Theo Maledon. He's a projected top 10 pick.  
Raise Nico Mannion. He's a projected lottery pick.  
Raise Daniel Oturu. He's soaring up draft boards.  
Raise Onyeka Okongwu. He's a projected top 5 pick.  
Raise Jaden McDaniels. He's a lottery pick.  
Raise Payton Pritchard and Omer Yurtseven. They're both mid 2nd round picks.  
Lower Isaiah Joe and Grant Riller. They're projected to go undrafted.  
Move McKinley Wright from 2021 to 2020, he declared. Also, add IV at the end of his name.

> DeAndre Hunter was traded from the Lakers, not the Pelicans

Hunter was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers with the 4th overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft, and then traded to the New Orleans Pelicans in the Anthony Davis trade, and then again to the Atlanta Hawks along with Solomon Hill in exchange for picks Nos. 8, 17 and 35 in the 2019 NBA draft

> Andre Iguodala's contract lasts until 2022, not 2021.

The 2021-22 season on his extension is optional. Maybe I'm wrong but currently I don't think the Heat will activate this player option in 2021

> Move Jrue Holiday to SG. He's been playing there 61% of the time. Please don't make him a GF, he's only 6'3"".
> 
> Move J.J. Redick to G. He's been playing 31% at PG and 60% at SG.
>
> Draymond Green should be a PF. His SF minutes are going to drop with Wiggins.

I'm a bit reluctant on these ones - Jrue mostly plays at SG now to make room for Lonzo, but the guy knows how to play PG and still averages 7 APG... While Redick only averages 2 APG... I guess this is one great illustration of the limitations of my stupid rules regarding players positions but I'd rather keep him a SG for now.

Same for Draymond, he can play (bad) at both F positions...

It's still possible I'll change my mind in a next release.

> Trae Young's overall is low at 63. That should be raised.

This one is really tricky: his simulated stats (apart from RPG) are somewhat already accurate. Also, the game engine is not really used to handle these kind of players at this age (Doncic being the worse example) and they turn into monsters too frequently. I increased his rebounding rating, but won't change much his ratings for now
 
> Matthew Dellevadova's dunking should be way lower. He's yet to make a dunk in the NBA. Also lower his 3pt shooting, he's shooting 23% from the 3 on 91 attempts.

I'll decrease his ratings but keep in my the dunk rating is worth for dunks and layups

> Lower Michael Kidd-Gilchrist's overall

Nah, I'm the secretary of his fan club, and I'm sure he's gonna be the 2021 FMVP. Would rather not change his ratings for now (as his simulated stats are already awful)

> should raise Klay Thompson defense

Let's wait for his comeback

> It might just be me, but JaMychal Green's overall is pretty high.

You might not be wrong, but I'm having trouble rating him accurately. His simulated stats are still lower than IRL. I've tweaked his rating, won't change much his overall.
 
> Raise George Hill 3pt shooting, he's shooting 48% from 3.

Simulated stat: 1.5 3PM	3.1	3PA 47.8% (vs 1.4 3PM	2.9 3PA	48.0% IRL). Does that really need a bump? His 77 3PT rating is 11th in the league, he has the best 3PT% of the league but on a low volume
 
> Lower D.J. Wilson's overall

I'm not high on this player but his simulated stats were already quite lower than IRL... He got a bump instead

> Lower Josh Okogie's overall

I've tweaked his ratings, but won't lower his overall for now...
 
> Raise Devin Booker's overall

His simulated stats are already inflated, he'll get a small decrease in the next version...

Won't change the ratings for now of draft prospects (except for Hampton who seems he felt down in most mock drafts) as the order of the draft change every time you load a new game (even using god mode)

For instance with Pokusevski: he's listed #15-20 in most of my sims (Ok, I had one where he was #6, also another one where he was beyond #20).

And in my latest save, Grant Riller was dead last in the 2020 prospect rankings

OK, I've listed him among 2020 prospects to add


> Semi Ojeleye was born in Overland Park, not Ottawa
> 
> Kevin Durant was in a sign and trade, not a free agent signing.
>
> Kemba Walker was in a sign and trade from Charlotte to Boston, not signed in free agency. Terry Rozier was also in that trade.
> 
> Bismack Biyombo was traded from Orlando, not Oklahoma City. His free throw rating should be lowered as well. Plus, his college should be changed to Spain because that's where he was playing before joining the NBA.
> 
> Dragan Bender is still on the Warriors
> 
> Jayson Tatum is playing 89% at PF. He's not a SF.
> 
> Marcus Smart is playing 23% at PG and 73% at SG. I know its not the 25% threshold, but he plays PG when Kemba is off the court.
> 
> Kristaps Porzingis is a FC now. He's been playing 69% at PF and 31% at C.
> 
> Andrew Wiggins should be a SF. He's only played 12% at SG and that's only going to go down while he plays in Golden State.
> 
> Move Landry Shamet to SG. I don't even know why he's guard, he's never played at PG 20% of the time.
> 
> Move Reggie Jackson to PG. The last time he's played there 20% of the time was back in 2014-15.
> 
> Kyle Anderson is a FC. He's been playing 62% at PF and 24% at C.
> 
> Jae Crowder is a F. He's been playing both SF and PF for the last 2 years.
>
> Chris Chiozza deserves a boost. He's been playing more backup PG minutes now that Kyrie is out.
> 
> Lower Nicolas Batum's rating. He was bad in the 22 games he played this year.
> 
> Adam Mokoka deserves a slight boost. He's been good in the G League this year and has also played in 11 games.
> 
> Lower Bruce Brown's overall. Joke's over lol
> 
> Klay Thompson is only playing 13% at SF. Probably should change him back to a SG. 
>
> Get rid of Stephen Curry's Perimeter Defense badge.
>
> Lower Draymond Green overall.
> 
> Lower William Howard's overall. He's on a two-way contract and is a 50 overall.
> 
> Move Patrick Beverley to PG. The only time he ever played a high percentage of SG minutes was in 2017-18 when he only played 11 games.
> 
> George Hill is playing 87% at PG. 
> 
> Cheick Diallo is a C. He's playing there 82% of the time.
>
> Give Patrick Beverley the Perimeter Defense badge.
> 
> Jordan McLaughlin still deserves a bit of a raise
>
> Can you change Dennis Smith's name to Dennis Smith Jr. so if he has any kids in the game they won't be Dennis Smith Jr? Same thing with Kevin Knox II and Kelly Oubre Jr.
>
> Lower Cheick Diallo overall, specifically his defensive IQ.
> 
> Raise De'Aaron Fox's overall a little bit
> 
> Lower R.J. Hampton. He's not a top 5 pick.

Fixed for the next version, thanks!"
3035,2020-05-08 07:24:26,gbdt33,Thanks for the suggestions! A complete 2022 draft class will probably my next project once I add all historical playoffs stats (I'm almost done).

3047,2020-05-02 17:22:03,gbdt33,Yeah he's trolling my guy
3048,2020-05-01 09:03:06,gbdt33,"No, you‚Äôre not slow. A mechanic of the game is a ‚Äúfuzzed‚Äù rating, which means the ratings you see can be anywhere from +10 to -10 of what they actually are. Giannis is a 79 in the roster, but your scouting finances are not high enough to see that accurately, so it shows 73."
3049,2020-05-01 19:27:39,gbdt33,"that's a very nice idea indeed, I think he's gonna be the HOFer added for the next version, thanks!"
3050,2020-05-01 09:04:22,gbdt33,"Ahhhhhh wow, I never knew scouting could do that"

3052,2020-05-01 09:05:35,gbdt33,Just thought scouting was purely for draftees
3053,2020-05-01 09:06:31,gbdt33,"It is, mostly. Coaching is also a part of seeing accurate ratings, I believe. But coaching is also useful for progressing your players faster."

Canberran Ivan Soldo would be the ruck ahead of Max Lynch in that NSW/ACT team, too.

And whether you think Betts is more eligible WA or SA, he's least eligible for Victoria out of the three places where he spent time."

Team B has the better playmakers, but when 6 out of the 10 players on team A also are in the running for best scorer at their position, you don't need a floor general to get them good looks.  At least, not beyond what Curry and Nash can provide.

I'd pick team A comfortably."

Not to offend your delicate sensibilities, but this is absolute bullshit. A kid who can't follow the content and is only able to repeat a handful of words can't be older than 3. This documentary is not aimed at toddlers, so why is he watching it? If he's older, then he's developmentally capable of understanding that he might hear some ""bad"" words sometimes. Why should adults have to have content that is made for them and paid for by them censored because some parents can't be bothered to have a simple conversation with their kids?"

I have the first two picks, 1.03 owns Marlon Mack and wants Taylor. Originally I planned on drafting Taylor because he‚Äôs the best talent, but I could still get CEH and Dobbins (or some combination of the 3 if he decided to take someone else) if I trade back.

3130,2020-04-28 16:29:40,g9o1o7,"Top notch work. 

Respectfully, why arent you concerned with the likelihood of low passing game usage and Jackson vulturing for Dobbins? I know Ingram had 10 tds, but I think most are expecting the Baltimore offense to regress, at least a little. Seems like he has a safe floor (mid rb2 at worst) once he takes over, but a low ceiling too (low end rb1)."

Would you find it to be egregious to take a Burrow/Tua at 2.02 in a 1 Qb?

My situation is as one if the league favorites & after some dealing/roster cleanup my picks are: 1.02, 1.11, 2.02, 4.11 (also have to assume trading back from 2.02 is highly unlikely)

The league is pretty shallow at 21 roster spots but a lot of the teams seem to hoard qb's and I'd prefer to not roster more than 2. Currently only have Rodgers.

Felt like I would be pretty satisfied with my 1st 3 picks being  Taylor or Ceh + remaining best Wr (Reagor/Jefferson/Viska) + Burrow."

3136,2020-04-28 15:53:33,g9o1o7,"Since you promised to answer specific questions:

I did a SF startup recently and came out with 1.03.  The same guy owns 1.01 and 1.02 and completely ignored running back in the draft, so it's safe to say he's probably going RB/RB at the top.  At the same time, I went QB heavy atop the draft and my QB1/QB2 are Mahomes and Watson. RB1/RB2 are Jacobs and then an amorphous blob of Guice and Henderson.

My question: Am I insane to take Dobbins at 3 and let Burrow continue to fall?  From a pure roster contruction standpoint, it makes sense, but I didn't draft for ""Win now"" and feel like it's better to take Burrow just to increase total roster value."
3137,2020-04-28 16:20:40,g9o1o7,"I've been waiting this as your posts are one of the best resources for Super Flex leagues out there, so thanks for what you do!

Now, question: I am in rebuild and have 3 firsts (1.02, 1.03, 1.08) and three seconds (2.02,2.03, 2.10). We're in a superflex league (QB, SF, 2 RBs, 3 WR, 2 FLX, 1 TE) with 10 teams, so the QBs aren't quite as scarce as as 12.

**Assuming 1.01 is Burrow, I'm trying to decide if I should go with one of CEH/JT/Dobbins with 1.02 and take Tua with 1.03, or just take two RBs and run with it?** There is a chance I get stuck with a 3rd RB at 1.08 in that case if going BPA (not that its a huge problem to have).

I have 5 QBs already (Allen, D. Jones, Haskins, Minshew, and Stidham), so Tua would make 6. But none of them are sure things. I'd obviously trade one or two if I picked up Tua but curious your thoughts on rebuilding teams taking RBs as that may make me competitive earlier than expected."

To be clear, you are arguing that Dobbins not only *should* be ranked higher than Taylor, you predict he soon *will* be in expert consensus?"
3140,2020-04-28 22:19:55,g9o1o7,"I just want to shout you out for the write up. People are rightfully focusing on ranking and asking questions, but I stayed for the stream-of-consciousness prose, and meandering musings on value. It felt positively unique.

Mostly you've encouraged me to actively chase ""my guy"" of the WR's which is a helpful reminder. (I dont currently have draft capital)

Much has been made of the Akers landing spot. Are you on team ""the line is trash, the team is in decline, competition for touches exist"", team ""McVay is a god and he will again ascend. Rbs on the rams were not unproductive last year""  or somewhere in the middle?"

I have 1.01 and 1.03 (and 2.06). 12 team, .5ppr, 1QB. Have a slight need at WR and a slight excess at RB. In short, I‚Äôll say I‚Äôve exhausted trade back scenarios where I can land Lamb (my target guy). In this situation would you take CEH at 1.01 and Lamb at 1.03? Or go CEH/Dobbins? Your write up says Dobbins is the call for BPA. But I, too, have Lamb highly rated. Part of me says go BPA and make a trade mid season to help with WR depth if need be. Other part says get your guy even if it is a reach. Thing is, I might be fine with WR depth especially since I can pick a WR up with my 2.06. 

My RBs: Zeke, Jacobs, Mixon, Drake, Edmonds, Bernard (can/will start 4)

My WRs: OBJ, Golladay, DJM, Mclaurin, Preston Williams, Corey Davis, JJAW (must start 3)"

I‚Äôve got picks 1.2, 2.12, 3.2, 3.3.  I‚Äôm struggling to go QB or not.  I‚Äôve got plenty of QBs but no high end talent.  Is the juice worth the squeeze with Burrow and Tua? I agree with your comments about the problem with Burrow/Tua if they are middling level players.  I need a top ten QB.  I am also leaning Tua over Burrow but have come around to taking CEH or Dobbins now.  

Would you go QB at 1.2 with this roster?  Or would you go running back and try to trade up do get either Burrow or Tua from 2.12.  Of course problem with trading up from 1.12 is that I miss out on great depth of WR class.  Thanks again.

3147,2020-04-29 20:20:19,g9o1o7,"You are all about the little details throughout the season to get a more accurate picture of an athlete and his abilities. I was wondering what your research on dobbins says about his athletic testing since he didnt do much at the combine. A quick search from nike claims him to be elite running a 4.4 with 40+ inch vert but idk how true this is , does it line up with what you found."

But left me light on the young Wr side. I have Reagor, Shenault, and T. Johnson as my big three. Thinking about making a play for either Ceedee, Jeudy, or Pittman. RBs are so think I‚Äôm my league. What do you think my chances are?"
3150,2020-04-30 14:14:27,g9o1o7,"I actually ended trading Lindsay, Asiasi, and a 4th for Pittman and a 2nd. I feel decent about it. Especially since I‚Äôm going to be a young team for a while lol."
3151,2020-04-30 16:54:44,g9o1o7,u/Killtec7 where is Higgins in relation to Viska and Pittman??
3152,2020-05-04 14:28:32,g9o1o7,"Amazing and thorough write up! I've been very excited to read this for this offseason. 

My question here is, would it be outrageous to sell Mixon for 1.03 (dobbins) + something? I'm in a pickle though after reading this, and on the clock as it shakes out. 1.01 in a 2QB took JT, leaving CEH and Dobbins there for me. I was set on Dobbins if he took CEH but now that they're both there, I'm thinking I go CEH (doesn't hurt that i have mahomes too). I think 

I've got a young team that i don't expect to compete this year, but the core is solid (Mahomes/Jones/Lock, Mixon/Monty, Allen/Kupp/Landry/Golladay). I think what i struggle with is that I loved Dobbins in college and your write up on him definitely supports going after him, but i think i struggle with the idea of moving mixon because in the end, we wind up hoping that Dobbins would be a top 10 RB, which is what Mixon is, or so we assume."
3153,2020-05-08 15:26:42,g9o1o7,"like you, I‚Äôm very high on Dobbins, but I also like Akers. Would you give up Dobbins for Akers and a 1st next year?"
3154,2020-07-06 15:37:07,g9o1o7,"I think i've been reading this capstone too much because i just got out of the 2nd round of our rookie draft with:

* Ceedee Lamb at 1.05 (After JT, CEH, Dobbins, Akers) 
* Laviska Shenault at 2.05 (with dillon, vaughn, moss still on the board)
* Edwards at 2.09

And i still have 3.03 and 3 4ths to play with"
3155,2020-04-28 17:36:12,g9o1o7,"Shenault over Pittman? Interesting. Hell, you took Edwards over Pittman, too, in Draft A. What do you not like about Pittman?"
3156,2020-04-28 21:23:50,g9o1o7,"Word of the day, Lamb:

>A **sheep** in its first year is called a **lamb**, and its meat is also called **lamb**. The meat of a juvenile **sheep** older than one year is hogget; outside North America this is also a term for the living animal. ... Younger **lambs** are smaller and more tender. Mutton is meat from a **sheep** over two years old, and has less tender flesh."
3157,2020-04-28 15:09:17,g9o1o7,">SF league taking Burrow 1.05? jesus

T'was nuts.  The other CeeDee seeker and I were wondering what the hell was going on.  But once you have a few wrenches throw into the mix (unique take/play by 1.01, Jeudy-stan) Burrow quickly became a hot potato.  Everyone assuming they'd get a kings ransom for him, but no one coming up for him."
3158,2020-04-28 15:33:06,g9o1o7,"So Shenault-Aiyuk is a coin flip for me.  I obviously took Shenault over Aiyuk twice and I think it mostly came down to statistical profile.  Shenault just has a very well rounded statistical profile and mirrors more of your success stories.

Aiyuk had a round about way to success, had to go the JUCO route, was stuck behind N'Keal, I don't blame him.  But with the subdued passing attack in San Fran, the presence of Kittle/Deebo, and Shanahan showing less consistency in the public eye (last year no one ran routes in college, this year Aiyuk runs all the routes); I'm just not ""in.""

That'll probably bite me in the ass, which is why I'm not proselytizing Shenault > Aiyuk, because it's not a clear position; I just decided to swing on Shenault this year.

With regard to draft capital I consult a very limited, but baseline tool for draft capital evaluation ( [https://i.imgur.com/T87UvbA.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/T87UvbA.jpg) ).  It's very simply % of players by pick that reach CarAV thresholds (the stud line, grey IIRC is CarAV>45, which limits you extensively to studs and long term football players).  In this case pick 40 for WR is 35-44 (Shenault = 42), the fit suggests approximately an 18\~19% hit chance; for a player like Aiyuk picked 25 overall the hit rate is about 20-22%.  I'm not comfortable with those margins to explicitly say who has a better chance at succeeding.

I do think it's important for Aiyuk-stans that Aiyuk was reportedly a top 20 player for San Francisco, so they do love him and I could easily rue the day that I didn't select him.  We can say this about a lot of players, but at the end of the day all we have is observed draft capital.  (See CeeDee Lamb being #6 overall, success rate would go from 20\~25% to 40%\~).

As to the corrollary with Trautman, it was the thing I keyed in on when looking for a light in the dark of the 3rd-4th round.  Why take Tyler Johnson or Eno Benjamin when Payton suggested he just found his TE of the future?"
3159,2020-04-28 15:15:54,g9o1o7,And with the 49ers saying they were even thinking of getting him with their first pick before they knew kinlaw was there.
3160,2020-04-28 15:36:11,g9o1o7,"Yeah, it's just such a mixed bag I hate to waste time writing about it.  I know where people are coming from on Moss and the landing spot is solid enough.  I don't hate it, but from what I've seen he's going mid-second to early-third and I have my guys there (Edwards, Dillon, Trautman)."
3161,2020-04-28 15:39:25,g9o1o7,"I think all three are right in the conversation for top 10\~top 15 backs.  I'm very comfortable with Dobbins being in the top 10 and he's the lowest ranked guy you have.  WR20 for Lamb works, I just would expect it to bite you in the ass production wise.  My expectation the next year or two isn't necessarily locked in fantasy starter--it's checking boxes.  So looking at Reggie Wayne or DeAndre Hopkins growth as a player for example.  Hopkins would be the absolute high end I would expect for the first 2 years.

As much as I love CeeDee, I do think it's important to understand Dallas may struggle this year.  First year head coach, new system, QB without a long term deal that has lost his mother, and now his brother in the past year.  They should be good, but that is a lot of stress for Dak to be under.  I'm not the biggest Dak-fan but I will be rooting for him on a personal level this year."
3162,2020-04-28 15:47:18,g9o1o7,"I've been quite thorough in saying I had little to no biases in the top 5 RBs over the past few 6 months or so and I think that's just the way this all plays out.  I still think Taylor is extremely safe.  CEH is a hype-orgasm, but plenty of skill to deliver, and Dobbins-Jackson is a dream come true.  I still like Akers, even if my trust in the Rams is shaken, and no open complaints for Swift-Detroit.

To me, frankly, Dobbins hasn't climbed at all.  He's frankly right where I had him bracketed the entire time--just didn't think I'd eventually lead the hype train on him."
3163,2020-04-28 15:43:34,g9o1o7,"Literally anything.  If that 1.03 has 2.03 in a 10 or 12 team league, I'd race to the podium."
3164,2020-04-28 16:47:08,g9o1o7,"> I know [..], but

Again looking historically at RB compliments to rushing QBs they all averaged near 1300 scrimmage yards and 10~ touchdowns.  Even looking at as messy of a situation as Cam Newton's-Carolina tenure, with multiple first round backs, a competent FB (TD vulture galore), you still had guys putting up 1000/8 seasons.

With Lamar's size and skillset in the passing game I just don't worry that we'll see a Newton-Carolina situation and more of a Vick-et al and RG3-Morris.

Baltimore's offense will probably be less explosive, but I wouldn't expect the running game to be less efficient or RB touches to just evaporate.  I do think Dobbins may have a lackluster year 1, but if I get 5 years of healthy Dobbins-Lamar, I have a feeling he'll be the most productive back in the class."
3165,2020-04-28 17:49:43,g9o1o7,"> Would you find it to be egregious to take a Burrow/Tua at 2.02 in a 1 Qb?

Depends on who is on the board and the league settings.  Generally, with the way I am seeing drafts play out, yes.  I think Tua would be there in the third for you.  But, if you differ from me in your opinions, who am I to say?  I would prefer to have guys like Reagor-Laviska before those guys.  If a few guys like Ruggs, Aiyuk, Vaughn go earlier than expected, hell Akers might even be there.

> My situation is as one if the league favorites & after some dealing/roster cleanup my picks are: 1.02, 1.11, 2.02, 4.11 (also have to assume trading back from 2.02 is highly unlikely)

On draft day see if you can throw some shit at the wall and get into the back end of the second or the early third.  I found most of my league malleable to throwing late second rounders once they see the board and 3rd rounders like candy.

>The league is pretty shallow at 21 roster spots but a lot of the teams seem to hoard qb's and I'd prefer to not roster more than 2. Currently only have Rodgers.

Unless you think Tua or Burrow is a stud, and I don't use that word loosely, I would not take them at 2.02.  There is a chance in 21 roster spot leagues one of them is on waivers by the end of the year.  Depends on how your league values them.

> Felt like I would be pretty satisfied with my 1st 3 picks being Taylor or Ceh + remaining best Wr (Reagor/Jefferson/Viska) + Burrow.

Even if the value isn't perfect, there is nothing wrong with that haul.  Just based on the way my board is playing out I'd be hoping for Dobbins at 2, then 2 of Jefferson/Akers/Reagor/Viska.  That is my rough order in the moment, but I'm not firm on any of it; Jefferson=Akers=Reagor, pick your flavor."
3166,2020-04-28 15:19:39,g9o1o7,"Not anyone in particular.  

There are stylistic comps like prime Ray Rice.  Honestly his burst and skill are easily evident in the college tape and when you go back and look at Vick/Dunn, Vick/Shady, RG3/Morris, Lamar/Gus Edwards, Lamar/Ingram it easy to see the production.

It's early to say where I'd take Dobbins in a startup, but he easily has a line into top 10 RB which by many rankings makes him a second round startup guy--which is crazy.  Then again I thought Saquon RB1 (while I agreed and turned down numerous offers from Zeke/Gurley owners at the time) was just crazy."
3167,2020-04-28 15:54:47,g9o1o7,Generally ones that aren't blatantly overfitting.  Nate Liss' work has generally been pretty solid. /u/rosecitypeach 's WR work is always sound.  Those are the two that immediately leap off the top of my head.  I'd have to go back to some of my reading for more.  I'll bookmark this for later.
3168,2020-04-28 16:00:20,g9o1o7,"No.  This is completely determinant on how your league views Burrow.  In young superflex leagues I've found sometimes people go overboard on QB values so maybe you can get a swing.  But I've noticed in older superflex leagues, the guys that secure their QB position would let Burrow fly by them mid-to-late first if someone (in my perspective) like Lamb or Akers is there.

The mindset on this sub is always hoard QBs, someone will eventually come.  Well, not always, and if Burrow doesn't flash immediately you're stuck with a middling asset that at that point--no one could have expressed interest in.

What's more likely, Dobbins a top 15 startup pick this next year or Burrow?  I'd argue Dobbins."
3169,2020-04-28 16:52:25,g9o1o7,"I'd start probing the league for high end QBs.  I can't speak to you exactly who is worthy of chasing because some people love Dak and Watson, some people love Wentz, some people are Wilson/Mahomes/Jackson or bust.  But I'd see about spinning some of these picks for one of the top tier QBs.  If one of Wilson/Mahomes/Jackson is available for a deal containing 2 or 3, I'd look that direction.

Personally I believe Dobbins and CEH will only grow in value over the next couple of months.  KC and BAL will be the talk of the town.  So to me they are the only guys I would consider picking at 2/3; you can always spin them for something else before the season starts.  This might be the best time to trade the value of that pick though for a starting QB you can start/forget.

If you can't trade, I'd personally go CEH, Dobbins, then one of Lamb > Akers~Tua at 8.  But again, that's me.

But I would go see if I can milk one of Wilson/Wentz+ for CEH or the rights to Dobbins/Taylor."
3170,2020-04-28 16:48:00,g9o1o7,"No he was tagged as a RB in the draft.  They envision a CMC like role for him (not explicitly in quantity of touches but type of touches), and CMC is still very much a RB."
3171,2020-04-28 20:01:18,g9o1o7,"At face value I don't have a preference between the two.  I don't think there is a clear difference.  I do believe though the allure of Lamar-JK is going to quickly shoot him to the top of a lot of people's boards.  I think people will get CEH fatigue and want to be different, especially considering CEH was a contenious prospect pre-draft.

I'd still firmly say that any of the top 5 RBs in this class may be the most productive in the class.  Favorites right now are easily CEH-JK-JT, Akers in the close 4th for me, and Swift hanging in at 5.

I just think if you are drafting right now.  Taking Dobbins at 2 is going to have better insulated value than a player like JT, Burrow, Tua, etc.  I think Dobbins and CEH are going to be red hot assets in the fantasy world come August."
3172,2020-04-28 23:46:37,g9o1o7,"Appreciate that acknowledgement.  I tried to be very up front about the fact it wasn't a typical gospel rankings post.  Hopefully no one missed it.

I think we happen to drape all these qualifications around players and then forget to think about how it measures on the margins.  Player X has reason 1 2 3 and player Y has reason 4 5 6, but really how much better is reason 1 2 3 over 4 5 6? Rankings a lot of times come down to who is available where and how you react to it.  Rankings are inherently anchored to conventional wisdom and the consensus.

Very much in the middle on Akers, but I prefer the upside of his profile over a number of receivers in the mid to late first.  He was my goal at 1.08 in the draft I took Tua."
3173,2020-04-29 01:21:28,g9o1o7,"I generally have Lamb rated above Burrow and Tua.  Can't say I'd take Lamb over them in every situation but if I felt good about Kyler and Goff I'd consider it.

Without knowing much about your team.  I'd plan on one of the 3 runners at 4, one of Jeudy or Lamb at 9 if he is there and Trautman at 9.

Tua-Akers-Reagor-Jefferson would the play at 9, from most of the leagues I've seen."
3174,2020-04-29 13:54:04,g9o1o7,"If Lamb is your must have and you are absolutely certain he's a stud, who am I to tell you differently?  I still believe if you get CEH/Dobbins you'll be happier in the long run.  But it's still less than a coin flip chance at success for both of them--so don't ride/die on that opinion."
3175,2020-04-29 13:42:31,g9o1o7,"If that‚Äôs your team in a 12 team, 1 QB league - AND you have 1.01 and 1.03, might I suggest you join a league with a higher skill level?"
3176,2020-04-29 19:20:22,g9o1o7,"With your RB situation I'd rather have one of the big 3 runners at #2.  You can always trade them for another QB and frankly with Staffords run last year, I'd feel comfortable enough with that cohort this year.  None of them are going to give you a production premium but they'll all be good enough.  That RB should give you a production premium.  Then honestly, I'd just stack handcuff RBs with the 2nd and thirds.

If you really want a QB I'd use that 1.02 to go get one, not draft one of these guys."
3177,2020-04-29 20:30:05,g9o1o7,"Reportedly he ran a 4.32 and leapt 43"" at Ohio State.  I'd have to go find the pictures of their record boards.  Literally a freak.  Ohio State runs fast and always seems to test their athletes favorably in facility, but even if he's 36"" vertical and 4.52 he's still an above average athlete at the position.

3178,2020-04-30 14:12:14,g9o1o7,"If I'm trading one of Zeke, Taylor, Dobbins I am chasing one of the big studs in the league.  I am valuing them like top 5\~10 RBs and not giving them up for less.  With the way the WR's rooms project I am not going to simply plan for those 3 to be dynamo's from jump.

I trust CeeDee Lamb long term.  I am not expecting wicked fantasy production year 1, and as such will value him less in the near term.  I view taking Lamb top 5 in a rookie draft as a sunk cost in the near term."
3179,2020-04-30 14:19:51,g9o1o7,I prefer that.  Like the upside on Pittman and depend on how the board falls that 2nd round pick might be more valuable than all three of those pieces.

3181,2020-05-04 14:48:01,g9o1o7,"I'd be more comfortable with Dobbins than Mixon long term.  I just trust Harbaugh and the Ravens more than I trust Taylor and the Bengals.  Short term Mixon is tee'd up for a career year though.

I know the hype is CEH > Dobbins; to me it's a coin flip as to who is ultimately more productive.

That lineup is good enough that it could cause some waves if the right things happen.  All 4 of those receivers have a good chance of leading their team in major receiving categories and any combination of Mixon/CEH/Dobbins is likely a competitive RB lineup."

Sorry if I'm wrong!

Seriously though.  I would ping people about trading up for Dillon if he's still on the board and if that isn't necessary then I'd burn all of the 4ths to go get Trautman and call it a draft.

Then again, don't listen to me.  Run your own draft haha."
3184,2020-04-28 17:55:37,g9o1o7,"I love Edwards.  Simply put.  He's my dude.

I had a hard time taking Edwards over Pittman in Draft A I just knew I wouldn't be back on the board--it was get Edwards or lose Edwards there.

Pittman is absolutely worth a second rounder though.  Profile is excellent, if not a little worrisome from the senior year surge, but I love the fit with Indy and wouldn't blame anyone for taking him over Edwards.

&#x200B;

Shenault, again just watching his tape.  Naturally he is just a better athlete, I project his ceiling far higher than Pittman's and that will probably get me in trouble.  I look at 2nd round picks as picks that I can go get my guys being unburdened by doubt.  Some years I'll get JuJu/Godwin, some years I'll get Damien Harris."

I had Dobbins the lowest because he slid a bit in the draft and was RB5 and will be behind Ingram, but the stat about 100 yards from scrimmage with rushing QBs caused me to rethink, especially since Ingram will soon be a nonfactor in my opinion. 

The Cowboys offense is tough to project for next season. Witten and Cobb both open up 83 targets each, and I see Jarwin stepping pretty much right in for Witten. I've projected CeeDee to get 90 targets which may be on the high end but I think he will work primarily out of the slot which should help him to a solid rookie year. I love his outlook beyond year 1 which causes me to want to reach for him even if it does doom me this year. I'm hoping the Cowboys offense is on the same level as last year seeing that I have Dak, Cooper and Gallup all on one team right now lol."

3195,2020-04-28 18:40:07,g9o1o7,"Thanks for the reply.

I'd really like getting 2 of that Jefferson/Akers/Reagor/Vaughn/Visky/Jeudy tier out of my 1.11 & 2.02. But as a favored contender I don't know how comfortable I am going in with just Rodgers and his age/recent injuries + wavier wire fodder like a Trubisky or something being my backup plan.

Guess I was checking if you valued any of those guys in the Kyler level like last season where he was late 1st/early 2nd. But maybe the strength of this class vs 2019 drops them down a bit further.

I suppose every league has it's own little roster building quirks, as we're still a newer league, no one really has extra picks to throw into trades.

Only offer I've had recently was something like Brandin Cooks for my 2.11 back. Which in some strange way I could turn the logic into like Tua at 2.11 and my 2.02 is all of a sudden Viska.

Either way, with a likely short training camp, this should be an interesting rookie draft season."

Hyde wasn't as talented as Ingram, and we were more sure he wouldn't be there in a year.  But Chubb never moved far up draft boards in a year where the #3 guy (or #2 after the Guice injury) was JAG Royce Freeman in what appeared to be a good near-term situation."
3201,2020-04-29 01:34:33,g9o1o7,I feel good about kyler and generally goff as well so I'll probably lean WR at that point.  I'm thinking akers will be gone as the draft looks like it might be RB heavy early

I‚Äôve made some good moves but what really set me apart was nailing the startup and hitting on DJM and Chubb in the rookie draft. The year I drafted Chubb, other people flopped on Guice, Sony, Rojo, KJ and Penny. I drafted Golladay and Juju super late as rookies in our startup. Sold Mack and Washington before the draft to move up from 1.11 to 1.05. Then traded 1.05 and 2.05 to move up to 1.01. Traded Godwin for what turned out to be 1.03 last off-season. Lost that trade pretty big. Sold Brandin Cooks last off season."

3209,2020-04-28 19:13:43,g9o1o7,"Don't get me wrong, I like Edwards, too. But Edwards was a bit like Hakeem Butler-lite for me. By that I mean, I REALLY liked him a year ago and expected him to be drafted higher... also would have liked a better situation. I hate the Raiders' situation. I recently passed on Ruggs in the late 1st because I hate it so much.

Maybe you've got large rosters or taxi squads, but my logic is that Pittman has a MUCH better chance to increase his stock in year 1. That's typically what I use to break ties. Sounds like I'm saying just draft for situation, but it's all about trade value. I think I can go get Edwards cheaper after year 1 (or mid-season) than I can get Pittman at that time.

Pittman had a much higher draft pick, clear path to starting in 2WR sets, has a better QB, and a better offense. Edwards will be behind Ruggs and Tyrell in year 1 and will be stuck with Carr and Chucky for the foreseeable future. He might have to be the next Robert Woods.

But this system has its flaws. I passed on Godwin based on this logic and tried unsuccessfully to trade for him for two years. By year three it was too late. The trade market just isn't liquid enough sometimes."

If you sense weakness in anyones resolve then Id sit put and hope someone swings on Jeudy/Lamb.

Id also be comfortable accepting Akers into my heart in standard.

Best case is ask 1.01 if he's solidified his pick, suggest you're trying to tease out what things look like at 1.04.  Once they tell you, tease out the information from 1.02 by offering the 1.01 intel, do the same for 1.03."

JK's a far hotter name than Chubb.  Chubb was type-cast as a 1 dimensional runner with no top end speed that would be lucky to be Jordan Howard.  I led the Chubb RB2 charge trying to remind people that Chubb was the Saquon before the Saquon.  JK has really good passing down reps and no glaring red flags outside of the rough start to the 2018 season.

Chubb was paired with a rookie QB.

JK is paired with the best running QB of the generation that might have the best arm talent (at least where JK is concerned) of any running QB in the past 20 years."

I want a replacement level QB3, otherwise I want to trade him to improve the production premium elsewhere."
3221,2020-04-28 19:24:36,g9o1o7,"I think Pittman was explicitly drafted to fill the role they wanted with Funchess, good sideline presence, good contested catch guy, physical run blocker.  Personally I am high on Parris still--call me antiquated or stuck in 2019, I think Parris will have more targets but Pittman might be a 6-8 touchdown guy.

Edwards to me has the opportunity to be a true alpha WR1.  Based on all the information available he is a hyper-tuned 6-3, 215 4.50 (perhaps faster) 38"" vertical explosive athlete.  Good foot fire, good aerialist, physical runner (watch his Alabama game).  Also respected in the SEC..2nd team all SEC..yes he usurped Justin Jefferson in All-SEC voting by SEC coaches.

Daniel Jeremiah made two important comments to me during the announcement.  ""Had legs as a second round pick prior to the foot injury, projects similar to a Chris Godwin.""

Edwards earned a role alongside Deebo and brokeout as a young true freshman.  I was very hesitant on Butler the entire process (until the combine last year) and it was mostly because he was held back by Lazard (while I respected that within it's own merits)."

I‚Äôve been in talks with the Josh Allen owner.  He‚Äôs got Mahomes and Wilson as his starters and I love Allen (I hated him in the draft process) But we just can‚Äôt agree.  He is a big contender and would benefit greatly from moving Allen for a WR or TE plus another decent QB."

So for me seeing Pittman land in a plus spot with a relatively high draft pick was too much to ignore. I love him in the late 1st/early 2nd. So while I don't fault you for still liking Parris, keep in mind that Parris was drafted later than Pittman and plays a similar role to Hilton. For that reason, I expect Pittman to see more snaps than him. But Hilton has missed some significant time recently, so it's possible Campbell and Pittman both play a lot of snaps in 2020.

Additionally, Pittman is similar to Vincent Jackson and Keenan Allen, who both had success with Rivers.

But back to Edwards, I agree he's a potential alpha WR1 and I like the Godwin comparison. I just think he might be had cheaply mid-season or in the next offseason. Think about how cheap Campbell and Boykin are right now.

With that said, I'll probably overpay for him in my one league with a rookie auction draft. If you haven't done one, I highly recommend it."

Honestly I haven't read Harmon's stuff since before he played around with national media; he was at Yahoo IIRC and then had a small role at the NFL network.  I hate to ask, but does Harmon have any of his rankings public?  I'll start reading through his articles later--I'm disappointed I forgot to even look for his work."

I prefer the Pittman-Robinson comp over the Pittman-Williams comp; Williams can move once he gets rolling; I didn't quite see the same speed out of Pittman on tape.

Viska-DJ Moore comp is juicy, stylistically nailed it.

Don't see the Higgins-Thielen comp, I think Thielen is more bursty out of his routes.  Higgins is an underrated route runner but his bursty properties concern me.

Jefferson-Allen is easy.

I like Mims-Sutton

3233,2020-04-28 21:21:43,g9o1o7,"The Keenan comp was loose - it was more to say Pittman is closer to Keenan than Hilton is. I agree that Keenan has a specific skillset, but what made him successful with Rivers was his route running skills, his hands, and his contested catch skills. I don't expect Pittman to be nearly as good as Keenan as a route runner even if Harmon says it's a strength... Keenan is just that good. But I do think Pittman can still play a lesser version of that role for Rivers since he is a big target with reliable hands and tremendous jump ball skills. As an added bonus, he's got VJax-esque deep speed, which Keenan is unfortunately lacking.

As for Harmon's rankings, I don't think he's got them public and I don't subscribe to the website that posts his articles. I do follow him on twitter (literally the only thing I have twitter for), but don't recall seeing any rankings from him. I may have just missed it, though.

And yeah, I prefer the Robinson comp over Williams, but that's just because I like AR better than MW. AR had plenty of success deep. I think he's mostly doing possession work now because that's just Nagy's system... and Trubisky sucks.

I think it's good to do our best to manage risk among players--but equally as important to recognize just how close these players are to each other and how there are so many unobservable factors that will go into them being successful.  The Pittman-Robinson comp makes so much sense, especially once you consider Pittman's work ethic and bloodlines.  That's the only piece I regret; that and I am just waiting for 'Viska to show up on my IR. (Ha I guess you ask this question at the end of your post--I'm taking the risk here and accepting it with a sense of humor)

&#x200B;

I tend to be timid with expectations for all of my players.  Year 1 I just want that 500 yards crested and a majority of games played.  Random forests models in the past have suggested that that 500 receiving yards mark is an excellent split on long term success.  Essentially if you don't hit 500 yards your opportunity for success plummets (not impossible, far less likely).  It's a loaded demarcation though because obviously the most successful NFL players in history usually cross 500 yards.

With regards to Minshew, he averaged 233 yards/game with Chark, Westbrook, Fournette, and Conley all get >= 90 targets over the season.  On a full season that's 3700 yards.  Conley/Dede are both on the final years of their deals, Conley was explosive with 5 touchdowns and 16.5 yards per reception, but Westbrook only had 3 touchdowns and averaged 10 yards per reception.  Fournette is reportedly on his way out.

If we believe in Shenault, I can't say Conley or Westbrook are insurmountable players.  Especially with Westbrook's efficiency numbers.  So I'd think that puts Shenault immediately in line for a 90 target season, and if those 100 Fournette targets need to get redistributed I'd assume that's another 10-20 for Shenault and a couple dozen carries.

&#x200B;

TLDR; If we believe in Shenault the offense should be just capable enough to support him.  The way the targets were spread out last year suggests there should be an easy role for Shenault to slip in as a WR3-4 pretty early.  I have to put my hat on and accept that I am a Jay Gruden-stan at this point so I'll put my faith in him and that offense to get enough out of Shenault."

After this talk, I'll at least bid Shenault up to what I think his average auction value should be... and if I get him, I'll have some optimism."

I think this is a pretty stacked team if I do say so myself."
3303,2020-04-27 18:10:46,g93d3s,"Here's What I'm thinking:

&#x200B;

**Starters**:

**Rajon Rondo - $3 (2011-2012)**

\- the fact that rondo is available for this cheap kind of amazes me. Obviously the lack of range hurts, but he boosts the value of many other players that cannot create for themselves on-ball. I'm taking 2011-2012, where he was all-nba, led the league in assists, and was playing at an all-defense level.

&#x200B;

**Sidney Moncrief - $11 (1982-1983)**

\- contunuing with the trends of dfensive guards that can't shoot, sidney moncrief was an absolute stud from everywhere other than the 3pt line. I'll take his 1982-1983 season, where he won DPOY as a guard and averaged a career high in points. Keep in mind that he did this all while under 25% usage, allowing him to be a good Util player.

&#x200B;

**Larry Bird - $37 (1984-1985)**

\- larry legend. Not much to say here. I'm going with his 84-85 season. He averaged 28/10/7 on 50/40/90.

&#x200B;

**Dennis Rodman - $8 (1991-1992)**

\- Choosing a single season for rodman was difficult, just because of the different roles and teams he played for throughout his career. However I am going to opt to his 91-92 season which wasn't one of the years that he won DPOY. Despite the fact that he didn't earn the award, Rodman averaged 18.7 RPG while earning first-team all defense accolades. This defense will surely shut down any of the competition. The reason I haven't chosen a true scorer to go alongside Bird is because 

a) Can't have too many scorers, otherwise it would diminish the value of Bird

b) the next player

&#x200B;

**Moses Malone - $23 (1981-1982)**

God Moses Malone is underrated. You never really hear his name brought up, even in the top 10 conversation, despite being a 3 time MVP. While it's fair to argue that the 70's were a weaker decade, that should not lessen Malone's dominance.

I'm going with Malone's final year in Houston, where he won the MVP and finished with a statline of 32/15 on 51% shooting. I'm not worried about overcrowding of the paint, as rondo and rodman aren't really gonna score, while Moncrief relied heavily on the mid-range to score.

&#x200B;

**Bench**:

**Dennis Johnson - $3 (1984-1985)**

A 9-time all defensive player, it's fair to argue that dennis johnson would have many more individual accolades if he didn't suit up for the celtics. I'm going with his final ASG appearance in 84-85, where he was all-defensive while still facilitating the ball and shooting the best from 3-pt land for his career. 

&#x200B;

**Kevin Martin - $1 (2007-2008)**

I really wanted to put Allan Houston here, but I was one dollar over. Sigh. Kevin Martin was a walking bucket tho, so I'm happy he wasn't listed. He's gonna act as a scoring threat off the bench, ready to explode at any time. I'm not worried about him being a defensive liability, as the starters make up for him defensively. I'll go with him on Sacramento during the 07-08 season, where he averaged 24 on 45/40/86 splits.

&#x200B;

**Alex English - $5 (1985-1986)**

Speaking of walking buckets, oh my goodness could alex english score. The leading scorer of the 80s, alex english had a versatile skillset, and is a great first option off the bench for the all-time team. I'll go with 85-86, where he averaged 30.

Elvin Hayes - $6 (1978-1979)

One of the more underrated defensive players of his time, Elvin Hayes was a menace on the defensive glass. Averaging around 13 rebounds and 2.4 blocks for his career, he will provide a nice defensive cushion for the team. I'm gonna go with one of his later season when he was on Washington, as his usage is a little lower, and he played less mpg.

&#x200B;

Bill Laimbeer - $3 (1989-1990)

Man fuck Bill Laimbeer. If there was another center available that could shoot as well as he could, I would have chosen them. But he provides the spacing that the 2nd unit needs, and adds in a little bit of grit. Him and rodman (when playing together) will be a fierce matchup for any frontcourt duo. I'm going with 1989-1990, where he shot 36% from 3.

&#x200B;

Total: $100

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In general, my team leans heavy on defense, while having around 2 main scoring threats in each lineup. I can see there being some challenges against teams with good SG/SF on the second unit, but overall i'm happy with the build.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Fuck Bill Laimbeer"
3304,2020-04-27 18:56:30,g93d3s,"Here's my update to my [All-Defensive Team](https://old.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/fldi4s/nba_alltime_budget_draft/fky5uvg/):

|Player|Cost|

3306,2020-04-28 05:24:23,g93d3s,"Considering the respective prices and the caveat of everyone at their PEAK form;

- TOTAL.                             $99‚úÖ"
3307,2020-04-27 22:38:09,g93d3s,"I decided to blow most of my budget on a very simple concept: **Stephen Curry** \+ **Hakeem Olajuwon**. I'm a herb so I was always going to pick Steph, and I think Hakeem would be the perfect center for a modern 4-out team, whether operating in the high post as the fulcrum of a Kerr-style cutting and screening offense or working into the low post to kick out or score.

Originally I was going to fill out the rest of the starting 5 with big shooting wings, but I couldn't resist **Dennis Rodman** for the low price of $8. It reshapes my initial team concept a little but having the greatest rebounder of all time seems like an asset, allowing my team to get out and run the break without worrying about crashing the boards so much. And he and Hakeem could always split some minutes at C to help with spacing.

Finishing out the starting lineup with **Wesley Matthews** and **Bruce Bowen**, two knockdown shooters and tough defenders. Neither's much of a playmaker but they both succeeded in movement offenses, so they'd fit as passers, cutters and screeners around a Steph/Hakeem-centric offense.

For the bench, I'd start with two $1 guys off the menu: **Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf** and **Stephen Jackson**. The former is an ahead-of-his-time shooter who could be a solid Steph sub off the bench or form a terrifying shooting backcourt, while the latter is a good 2-4 swingman who can score from different levels without compromising my defense.

**Jaren Jackson Jr.**  completes my big rotation. He can hold his own at 4 or 5, spaces the floor if I want a shooter next to Rodman, and has no problem switching onto smaller players. Finally, with five bucks left, I'll fill out the bench with **Tobias Harris** and **Brandon Ingram**, two guys who have succeeded as featured scorers and should be overqualified as rotation wings/secondary playmakers. Either could comfortably sub into my starting/closing lineup if I need more shooting or playmaking on the floor.

Full roster:

* Guards: Steph Curry, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf ($39)
* Wings: Wes Matthews, Bruce Bowen, Tobias Harris, Brandon Ingram, Stephen Jackson ($12)
* Bigs: Hakeem Olajuwon, Dennis Rodman, Jaren Jackson Jr. ($49)"
3308,2020-04-27 19:35:52,g93d3s,"This team would need a good coach to stagger the minutes and work out the best rotations but:

PG

* MVP Derrick Rose (10/11)
* John Wall in his last healthy season (16/17)

SG

* MVP Iverson (00/01) 
* This year's Bradley Beal who put up 30 ppg

SF

* The Iceman George Gervin when he put up 33 ppg (79/80)
* Gerald Wallace in his all-star year (09/10)

PF

* Amare (07/08) when he finished ahead of Nash in the MVP vote putting up 25/10
* LaMarcus in his last year in Portland (14/15) when he looked like a star you could build a contender around 

C

* Prime Dikembe in his last year in Denver when he got 4.5 BPG
* DeMarcus the year he got traded to the Pelicans (16/17) when he was an absolute offensive beast

&#x200B;

A team with 2 MVP's and 8 stars, with $3 to spare. But you'd have to be very careful with the rotations, balancing the capable shooters with the defense."
3309,2020-04-27 21:07:06,g93d3s,"So posted another team but felt I needed to do My LeBron all time team. So I started with LeBron and my plan was put him with the best player for him, that ended up being Dirk. Pick and pop all day, but spending 78 dollars on two players I had to get creative



Devin Harris $1( he wasn't listed which I found crazy he had a 21ppg and 7apg season with the nets and he's been fantastic spot up three and defense)


Wesley Matthews $3 (I didn't like spending 3 on him but I felt he fits LeBron perfectly, and it you doubt his defensive chops he was guarding Durant the day Durant missed the most shots in a playoff game ever)


LeBron $45 ( he is the PG, I am sloting him in at sf, he is the perfect player, and the great thing is he's okay getting 30 and letting Dirk get 30)


Dirk $33 (pf, I feel Dirk gets underrated a lot, people don't realize how great he was offensively, you give him an elite player to take away double teams sign me in)


Dennis rodman¬† $8(center‚Ä¶ I wanted to put Dirk at center and LeBron at pf, but their would be too many elite centers to give Dirk trouble, Rodman can hang and if their happens to be no elite center Dirk can slide to center)


Michael Cooper $3 ( defensive player of the year for $3 sign me up)


Larry Hughes $1 ( so I found this an ironic pick because I'm picking the 20 per game defensive frenzy that the Cavs thought they were getting when they signed Hughes)


Mike Miller $2 (people don't remember but young Mike Miller could ball, and most importantly he still has the shot)


Harrison Barnes $1( long rangy defender that can play multiple positions, hit threes


Robert horry $3 ( big shot Bob,¬† by his stats he shouldn't be picked but he's big shot Bob for a reason, he turns it on in clutch time, and the playoffs)"
3310,2020-04-27 19:13:48,g93d3s,"So I really think building the best team should include LeBron or MJ, but without one of those this is what I came up with



PG: Deron Williams $8 (people forget how good prime DWill was, there was once a valid Argument over who was better DWill or cp3)


SG: Jrue Holiday $11 (he's a secondary distributor that's great off ball and defender)


Sf: Kevin Durant $37 ( I don't need to tell you why I picked him(


Pf: Pau Gasol $12 ( my thought process here is I need someone that can hang with elite pfs, Pau can do that, and has some range)


C: Joakim Noah $6 ( an all defensive center that helps against elite big men, was tempted to pick yao but I don't need the scoring I need defense)



Bench


Ron Artest $10( I splurged here but I feel Artest has a case to be the best wing defender ever and I'd happily pay $10 to slide him against MJ or against lebron instead of having Jrue out there if needed)


Michael Redd $8 ( with defense locked up I feel¬† having a great scorer off the bench will help open things up


Tyson chandler $4 ( rim rolling elite defender at center)


Josh Howard $2( elite defensive wing)


Chandler Parsons $1 ( so I picked Parsons here though I could have someone for $2 because I think he's very underrated because of his injuries if we are talking one peak year he had an 17 5 4 season with the rockets being a legimate 3 and D with passing chops brings ideal size and versatility)

=$99


So my goal with this was get very versatile players that could do multiple things‚Ä¶ I feel I did that I'm every comfortable facing off with any style of team and can adjust lineups however I want. If a team goes small I can easily put Gasol at center and Durant at pf if a team goes big I have a legitimate pf to match up with their pf and 2 elite defensive centers to do their best‚Ä¶. Jrue can be my back up point guard and I have a dominant SF in Durant that doesn't need the ball all the time like LeBron would."
3311,2020-04-28 01:32:34,g93d3s,"First of all, thanks so much for putting this together. I had a blast and spent way more time on this than I am proud to admit...

**PG** - Steph Curry ($38), George Hill ($2)

**SG** - Bradley Beal ($7), Wesley Matthews ($3)

**SF** - Elgin Baylor ($13), Ron Artest ($10)

**PF** - Elvin Hayes ($6), LaMarcus Aldridge ($4)

**C** - Karl-Anthony Towns ($13), Andrew Bogut (3)

Total Spent - $99

Building around Steph was tough and I almost bailed a few times, but I really wanted to see the best team I could put around him. To me Steph's gravity might be the most valuable attribute any player has ever had, and he also brings the high-level scoring and leadership to be my top dog.

After deciding on Steph, I turned my focus towards finding undervalued players. Elgin Baylor and Elvin Hayes were the first two that stood out to me. Baylor at $13 is criminal; I will take him in the 60-61 season when he averaged 35/20/5 over 73 games. He will become my secondary scorer and his rebounding allows him to slide to 4 when needed despite being 6'5"". Elvin Hayes was an absolute stud and his athleticism would make him relevant in any era. I will take him during his 3rd season in the league, 70-71 where he averaged 29/17 in 82 games.

After identifying the value of Baylor and Hayes, I tried to build a versatile roster that could compete in different eras against types of rosters. In Artest, Hill and Matthews, I have guys who can match up against a wing-heavy team like the modern Clippers without sacrificing spacing. I've always loved Towns' offensive skillset, and watching Curry/Towns PnRs would be unreal. And with Baylor, Hayes, Aldridge and Towns I shouldn't have any trouble on the glass. 

Baylor and Hayes would be negatives for my spacing, but I think Steph, Beal and Towns would balance them out enough to make the starting lineup workable. I have some concerns with my team against elite offensive big men, but I think prime Bogut and prime LMA/Hayes can all hold their own. If this team was going up against a Shaq/Wilt/Kareem/Hakeem type, I would just bring Towns off the bench in lieu of Bogut.

I'd have some concern going up against an elite 4 like Barkley/AD/Giannis/KG. That's definitely the weakest spot on my roster. But Artest was extremely strong for his size and such a bulldog; I think he could thrive as a modern 4 like a rich man's Harrison Barnes.

I'm kind of afraid to start putting together a team, because I have no idea how long I'll spend obsessing over it, and whether I'll ever climb out of the hole. But after perusing some of the teams, I do want to highlight an idea, and see how much sense it makes to people: the recency bias is understandable, but the prices of the early-NBA greats provide some of the best bargains. 


The following guys all won an MVP:


PG $2 Bob Cousy (same price as Eric Bledsoe)

PF $6 Bob Pettit (same price as Josh Smith)

C $4 Wes Unseld

C $9 Willis Reed 

C $4 Dave Cowens (all cheaper than Rudy Gobert, which again, these guys won MVPs!)


This thought began when I looked for Pistol Pete ($4) and saw he cost a buck less than JJ Redick


I know the game has changed a lot, yadda yadda yadda, but I think I'd begin with a foundation of Cooz, Pistol Pete, Bob Pettit, and Wes Unseld, a combined 4 MVPs for $16. I'm not saying these guys are my starters, but I feel pretty comfortable having MVPs on my bench for dirt cheap. And a guy like Maravich at $4 provides more value than Steph at $38."

3314,2020-04-28 21:23:50,g93d3s,"Before I start, I gotta say some of the prices for these players is hilariously cheap lol. But for me, it would be the following: 

Starters: 

PG: Steph Curry ($38). Already 1/3 of my total but he is the most impactful player of all time when he is on the court. The gravity he draws from defenders alone for spacing is just as valuable than anything he actually does with the ball. 

SG: Pete Maravich ($4). I‚Äôm literally clueless as to how he‚Äôs so cheap. He‚Äôs essentially Curry before the modern-era of the NBA. Look up how far he shot from and how consistent he was. Also has all the playmaking abilities of Curry, if not better to be honest (besides ball-handling). 

SF: Carmelo Anthony ($18). Once again...what the heck! How is he so cheap. Literally unstoppable one on one in his prime. Defense can‚Äôt bring a double because, well, look at my guards. 

PF: Chris Bosh ($15). One of the best stretch fours ever. Super consistent spot shooter, great rebounder, underrated defender. Was gonna go with Blake, but I‚Äôll take Bosh‚Äôs shooting for the extra 6 bucks. 

C: Karl-Anthony Towns ($13). Best C in the league offensively. It‚Äôs quite sad he‚Äôs so underrated and more sad that he will continue to be since he‚Äôs in Minnesota. Look at his numbers, especially from downtown. He shoots better than a lot of guards. Elite, elite rebounder as well. 

Bench: 

PG: Jason Williams($1). I didn‚Äôt see White Chocolate on this list unless I‚Äôm mistaken. Great facilitator obviously, pretty good shooter. Spark Plug off the bench for us with some fancy plays. 

SG: Tony Allen ($3). First Team All Defense. Enough said. 

SF: Bruce Bowen ($3). Perfect 3 and D player. Another Clamper alongside Tony. 

PF: PJ Tucker ($2). More 3 and D. You seem a theme with this team here? Lol I feel like D‚ÄôAntoni. 

C: Manute Bol ($1). Because why not lol. He can shoot too. 

As I finish typing this and look over my team...I know. We suck on defense. It‚Äôs quite clear. But we‚Äôll outscore any team in this thread."

Yes, I'm sure most teams would shit on this one, but it'd always be an under 90 point game. You can construct a better defensive team, I'm sure, for the same price. But at least this one has some semblance of offensive competency, as opposed to filling my team completely with the Andre Roberson / Tony Allen types. The goal is to run fastbreak with Simmons and Robinson off of defensive stops. Harris, Bowen, and Cliff are all capable shooters, so they provide spacing.

A lot of passing to go around on this team between Nash, McGrady, and Gasol. One good thing about McGrady is that he is very efficient with his movement and willing to pass the ball, so this notion that he'll be a ball-stopper is just false. Then, Bibby, Diaw, and Divac for the backups. There's plenty of shooting. Overall, this team will give up 130 every time, but score 160 on your ass.

I call this team the 3 headed snake. Nash, Klay and Scottie will be the soul of the team, highlighted by two-way SG/SF positions lead by a play-making PG.

LMA is an absolute highway robbery at $4, he was an absolute offensive monster and 4x All Star on the Blazers.

I'm cheating a bit with Sabonis, I think that he could have been an All Star MVP caliber player had he arrived in the NBA during his EuroLeague prime. His playmaking and range will compliment players like Klay and LMA very well, being able to give LMA more room to operate while finding Klay for open shots.

Everyone on my bench is pretty under-priced imo. Definitely Rondo is very undervalued. Dennis Scott is also pretty undervalued as well for what he can bring to the modern NBA (.425 on 7.7 3PA per game is insanely valuable). I'm pretty surprised David Lee was not listed at least at $2. He puts up good production with some decent defense and was even All-NBA Third Team in 2013.

EDIT: Removed DeMar (RIP) for more defensive minded guard Raja Bell. I think Raja Bell is a more valuable piece to build line-ups around."

Udonis for rebounding and grit and the Human Victory Cigar for the parade.

Some thoughts:

Center: Either I'm going all time dominant, or I'm going 3 and D. In this case I am going 3 and D. Either of the PF could also see time at C easily, so I'm not spending much here.

Power Forward: I love Tim Duncan, but he isn't worth almost 3 times more than Gasol here. Round it out with some more cheap big man shooting.

Small Forward: Kawhi is my man. Go to shooter, defender etc. that you need from either SF or SG. Gallinari is back up shooting, and can play some PF as well to amp shooting. Fluid offensive player for $3 is good to me.

Shooting Guard: Went cheap as hell, because Brogdon can shoot very well (and play 3rd back up PG), and Mitchell can get buckets. I'd have loved Ginobli but wen big on...

Point Guard: Chris Paul. Broke my no asshole rule for him, but somehow I don't see many of these players getting in an argument with him. Phenomenal passer, 3 point shooter, defender etc. Dragic, everything CP3 is if way less so. Besides, can't have Rondo on a Paul led team.

If you are not an elite creator, or maybe an elite center, you simply are not worth spending much money on. Scoring and shooting come stupid cheap, what you need is an elite playmaker for 48 minutes, which is why I chose two of them. I wish I could have included more older players, but without knowing how they'd shoot the 3 it is near impossible. Also, single season shooting splits are notoriously unreliable, so you should go more off of overall shooting numbers."
3326,2020-04-30 02:03:26,g93d3s,"This was a fun exercise. This team is my love letter to the mid 2000s Suns. 

**Starting Point Guard: 2004/05 Steve Nash $28** Offensively, I think Nash is in the same tier as Magic and Steph. Defensively, he's not good, but he's smart and he'll try and I don't think point guard defense is that important. I think he's the only player who is both a top 5 shooter and a top 5 passer of all time (He might be second in both) Picking a year was difficult, statistically, you could make an argument for 2006 or 2007 but intuitively to me it makes the most sense to me that Nash would be at his peak at age 30. He also had a monster playoffs, beating a really good Mavs team and leading the Suns to an efficient offense in a 5 game loss against the eventual champion Spurs

**Starting shooting guard: 2009/10 Joe Johnson $5** I wish the Armadillo Cowboy hadn't broken his face in 2005. I wish Robert Sarver hadn't been to cheap to pay him. He looked so good next to Nash in 05, hitting 47.8% of his threes on 4.5 attempts a game. There's a huge slice of luck in that, but I do think that his efficiency would have rocketed if he spent his prime next to Nash. In any case, he lead the Hawks to 53 wins, the 3rd best offense in the league and the second round of the playoffs in 2009/10. 

**Starting small forward: 2011/12 Andre Iguodala $12** I'm taking Andre's age 28 season, his lone all star season to try to blend his freaky athleticism and veteran experience. He's one of the best perimeter defenders ever, a great passer and not a complete non shooter.

**Starting Power Forward: 2003/04 Kevin Garnett $36**  Of the all time defensive bigs (Russell, Olajuwon, Big Ben, Duncan, Dwight, Draymond etc.) I think Garnett is the best shooter and passer which makes him my favorite choice to pair with a ball dominant guard like Nash. I also think playing with Nash would unlock him in transition in a scary way. 

**Starting Center: 2012/13 Marc Gasol $11** Choosing which season from Marc Gasol was tricky for me, but I went with his defensive player of the year winning season and am assuming he'll be able to shoot in the mid 30s from 3 if he takes them, even though he hadn't started shooting them yet. The Grit and Grind Grizzlies easily taking down the Clippers (with Blake limited) and Thunder (missing Westbrook) was truly impressive. I think Gasol + Garnett would form an incredible defensive front court and create a lot of fun offense with with their shooting and passing.

**Backup guard: 2019/20 Marcus Smart $3** I think Smart is one of the best defensive guards ever and ever and having improved his 3 point stroke to adequate he could earn minutes on an all time team. He also follows my theme of being an excellent ball mover and passer.  

**Backup forward: 2017/18 PJ Tucker $2** The thing that made saddest about the Rockets losing game 7 to the Warriors in 2018 was that it wasted PJ Tucker's performance. He grabbed 8 offensive rebounds, got 4 steals and even shot 2/5 from 3. He wanted to win that game so much more than anybody else on the floor. I think he'd be a great fit at 4 next to either Garnett or Gasol. He'll hit enough corner 3s to to keep the opponent honest, defend his heart out and grab a couple rebounds he has no right to. 

**Backup wing: 05/06 Raja Bell** Raja Bell shot over 40% from 3 on more than 5 attempts a game his 3 years in Phoenix. He made all defensive first team in 06/07, but statistically he was slightly better in 05/06, but I kind of think that was a lagging indicator and rewarding the Suns for winning more games. He shot the shit out of the ball in the 06 playoffs (19 points a game on 67% true shooting against the Clippers) before tearing his calf against the Mavericks, which doomed any chance the Suns had to make the finals.  

**Bench shooters: 2013/14 Patty Mills $1 19/20 Davis Bertans $1** My last two spots I'm reserving for shooting specialists. The Popovich Spurs have traditionally blitzed teams with their bench and I think the shooting of Patty Mills and Davis Bertans is a big reason why. Patty Mills played 19 minutes a game for the 2014 champion Spurs and sometimes really look Australian Steph Curry. I'm taking Bertans' season with the Wizards season when he really started bombing. He might not be good enough defensively to see much run in the playoffs but his quick trigger will boost any lineup's offense."

My thought process behind this is having two lockdown guards on the perimeter in Rondo and Moncrief who both also happened to be good distributors (Rondo obviously moreso). Plus Moncrief was a very good scorer from everywhere except long range. Bird being the obvious leader on offense as our do it all team leader. Rodman and Malone together down low would be fierce and I'm not sure if the other team would ever outrebound us. Malone was a very good scorer in his own right and possibly the most underrated player of all time.  


In regards to the bench I decided to double down on defensive point guards in Dennis Johnson. Maravich would be our offensive leader of the bench and could provide a spark to the team if needed. Batum is there as a bit of a glue guy, all around and could do anything the team asked of him. Jerry Lucas was picked because he was a solid scorer and had a good shot so we can have better spacing from our bench. Finally Joakim Noah holding down the defense for the bench. Another good distributor, Joakim was also a very good defender and would be great for our team. 


Overall I looked for most of my guys to be good defenders to allow for our Hall of Fame offensive guys to lead the team in the scoring department. Not only this but many of them are also good to great passers (Rondo, Moncrief, Bird, Johnson, Maravich, Batum, Noah) so the offense wouldn't get stagnant as they could all keep the ball moving."

You got some great value picks in Pau, Noah, Artest, Chandler and Parsons. This is probably one of my favorite teams I have seen on here. Only concern would be a lack of guard depth with only Williams, Holiday and maybe Redd as bonafide guards.

Curry 30ppg, Beal 30 ppg, Baylor 30ppg, Hayes 28ppg, kat 27 ppg.. even lma off the bench is primarily a scorer, there's not enough ball to go around and I feel that hurts your team because you're not able to get  the needed defense to supplement Curry and kat being below average into your starting lineup. Not only that going best available you also hurt your stars strengths.

Ex.  Your team would be far better with Wesley Matthews at the 3 than Elgin Baylor because he'll do the dirty work he'll play pretty damn good defense, he doesn't hurt spacing and he doesn't require the bell lot that opens up more shots for the best player to take in Curry"

It's why someone like Bledsoe is $3 and cousy is $2. Bledsoe doesn't need to be the ball handler, plays good defense and hits threes."
3342,2020-04-29 03:19:38,g93d3s,"Your team is interesting. As you said, the offense would be amazing, but not so much the defense. I think that's fine, but in that case I would swap out Bosh for someone like Iguodala so the team could get up and down the floor faster (Bosh is mobile for his height, but still...) and also giving you another player that can grab a rebound and just go. This would be doubling down on your strategy of trying to outscore everyone by playing at the fastest pace in the NBA.

Based on what I know about Maravich, he does seem like a steal."
3343,2020-04-27 21:20:54,g93d3s,"I really like the team I would say a couple things I see.I like sabonis, I like David Lee. I don't think either would be close to stopping an elite big man. Which I think could destroy this team

And I don't think DeRozan fits.a steal for sure  at $2 but there's other players that would support the team as a whole better. But really interesting team"
3344,2020-04-27 19:49:22,g93d3s,"These other teams are definitely better thought out but I'm trusting jordan and lebron to figure it out regardless of the rest of the team. 

Ten dollars left to fill out the squad with the entire history of the NBA is more than enough. Definently feels like there is some recency bias in the rankings so you can find studs or just solid role players that would complement Jordan and Lebron

Also might consider Drazen Petrovic for a buck on the bench. His prime is hard to evaluate but I think he would fit well"
3345,2020-04-27 23:42:41,g93d3s,"So you have like two different teams imo, instead of building a bench to help your offense you were like like me get a whole other team. I also don't really see Tony Parker meshing well with Kobe"
3346,2020-04-28 12:36:09,g93d3s,"So my issue is how does John Wall known ball hog fit with Curry who's a secondary distributor and Bam who's also a secondary distributor? I don't think he does. And since he can't shoot he actively hurts Curry's value.  Not only that I love jjj I love Bam they ain't stopping S**t if a dominant big man is against them, and though Camby can help he's not stopping an elite center (to be fair no one is) and he hurts the floor spacing even more...I think your team is far better with just a 3 and D wing instead of John Wall, and a defensive wing specialist and no Donovan Mitchell is not it"
3347,2020-04-28 15:36:53,g93d3s,"I mean this is based off of single-season performance and Draymond has one of the biggest outlier seasons (without KD) in NBA history where he was the best defender, one of the best passers and a positive 3-pt shooter all at once. He also was the best player in the postseason for a team that was a few baskets away from winning the title. He obviously never came close to being as good as he was that season again but he‚Äôs the ultimate 2nd best player in this I think."
3348,2020-04-28 21:17:26,g93d3s,You may as well put Jordan on the Wizards all time team if you are putting Pierce there.
3349,2020-04-28 03:07:54,g93d3s,Loool. My team would body yours.
3350,2020-04-28 02:53:55,g93d3s,"It's less about Klay's defense and more about his offense, and how it spaces the team with his lights-out three point shooting."
3351,2020-04-28 13:25:44,g93d3s,"Yes, Lebron is unselfish.

The proper perspective would be; The two of them and their best (and most efficient) teammate.

Scottie Pippen (6x w/Jordan) 

Dwyane Wade (2x w/ LeBron)



Option A: Running the offense through Jordan, LeBron can do any and everything Scottie Pippen could do and then some, as a compliment to the onslaught that is MJ.

Option B: Running the offense through LeBron, Jordan can do any and everything Dwyane Wade could do and then some, as a compliment to the onslaught that is LeBron. 

Not to mention LeBron is Bigger, Stronger and Faster than Pippen, with a much higher IQ  as a play reference.

Transversely Jordan is Bigger, Stronger and Faster than Wade, with a much higher IQ as a play reference.

+ Considering ‚ÄúPEAK‚Äù versions of all players; Think, the ‚Äò96 Bulls with a ‚ÄòSuper-Pippen‚Äô & WAY better role players at every position.

+ Or if you‚Äôd like, depending on your reference points; Think The ‚Äò12 Heat with a ‚ÄòSuper-Wade‚Äô & WAY better role players at every position."
3352,2020-04-28 17:03:38,g93d3s,"Thanks! Yeah, I wouldn't be averse to swapping out Harris or Ingram for another big for matching up with those huge frontlines. But on the balance I'd be happy just relying on Hakeem's rim protection as my last line of defense and trying to beat twin towers teams on the offensive end instead."
3353,2020-04-27 20:06:54,g93d3s,"I thought about it but the sheer amount of talent was too much to pass up.

They weren't ever thought of as ball hogs but Wade and Lebron were both guys who needed the ball a lot and weren't great outside shooters, but with staggered minutes and adjusting their playstyles they were an amazing duo. It's not an ideal situation, but I would start by making sure that any time 2 of those 3 guys are out there together you also have Gerald Wallace and Dikembe on the floor, star players who have tons of defensive impact and pretty much never need the ball, also I would have Rose and Iverson on the floor together as rarely as possible."
3354,2020-04-28 02:16:23,g93d3s,"It was definitely a tough  decision process for me but I trust Rodman  to hold his own against any center it's why I spent $8 I couldn't really afford on him. I was thinking about instead of Horry, to get a defensive center but that misses the point of the team which is play Dirk at center pick and pop with LeBron with 3 shooters on the wings. I get Dirk isn't great defensively but he's shown especially in his prime he'll outscore  the opposing player. Dirk has more than held his own against td, kg, even end of prime Shaq..

What two big men stopping a LeBron at pf, Dirk at center pick and and pop game?"
3355,2020-04-28 02:08:00,g93d3s,". I feel Josh Howard or Ron Artest who are both like 6'7 are versatile defensively to play sg and I'd rather have more bigger versatile wings  that can slot In at multiple slots than smaller guards. Especially in the modern 3 and D era. Definitely not a perfect team ...

My thought process is stagger d will and Jrue a bit.. Jrue can play back up point minutes and based on what team they are facing or if Durant is off the floor substitute the right player"
3356,2020-04-28 03:01:10,g93d3s,"Thanks for the feedback. I tried to think back to the Cavs/Warriors series when each team had 3 guys who could average 25+. It seems to me in these long playoff series with all the variables, you can't have too many capable scorers. But you're right, you definitely *can* have too many guys who need the ball in their hands. My hope would be that Steph, Beal and KAT can all contribute on offense through spacing without the ball in their hands.

You make a good point about switching Baylor and Matthews. Baylor and LMA could run my second unit and open up touches for Beal and Towns.

Towns almost definitely wasn't the optimal choice for my team, but I've always been so tantalized by his skillset and couldn't pass up on the thought of a Curry/Towns PnR."
3357,2020-04-28 18:41:28,g93d3s,"Prices are based on ADP, not on any kind of scientific formula. So a whole bunch of players that we saw on TV and remember their names are ranked ahead of or on par with all-time greats that we never saw. This is natural, it doesn't make any of us bad people or bad basketball fans, but the bias is real. Bledsoe or Rajon Rondo aren't a buck more than Cousy becasue of anything on the court, it's becaus we saw them on TV 2 months ago.

The whole, ""Cousy could only dribble with one hand"" has been proven absurd in other places so I won't go into it much again. You can dig into it if you care to."
3358,2020-04-29 03:36:24,g93d3s,"Certainly agree with that, very good point. I think they list him as a SF here though, so I don‚Äôt think I can if I‚Äôm abiding by the team making rules. But I honestly would replace bosh with Siakam. Don‚Äôt know how I didn‚Äôt see him."
3359,2020-04-27 21:30:16,g93d3s,"As a Toronto native, 2017-2018 DeRozan at $2 was just too big of a steal to pass up. He was All-NBA second team and was improving on his 3pt shot. But I think you're right, what I really need in that slot is a more defensive minded SG/SF to plug up some of the holes on the bench."
3360,2020-04-28 00:01:04,g93d3s,Placed the emphasis on a deep team that could throw a few looks at defences.
3361,2020-04-28 15:26:57,g93d3s,"Made some changes, still not really a great deensive centre with DeAndre Jordan, I kind of think it's a downgrade to Camby defensively, but he's one of the better rebounders ever and still was all-defensive twice and should have a lot of lob opportunities with the spacing.  


And then I swapped Mitchell and Wall for Smart and Bowen.  Better shooters and defenders both, 'cause I think you were right, too many playmakers that wasn't necessary and I feel more confident in our team D for sure now."
3362,2020-04-28 20:11:04,g93d3s,"People shouldn't assume he would shoot the same 3% percentage... if you were to play a different season with him he'd likely regress to the mean. His offensive repertoire is pathetic for the second best player on an all-time team. He'd be a bargain off the bench, or as the 5th starter, but that sure as shit isn't $28.

Also can everyone stop choosing Klay? Plenty of other SG out there. The Warriors are not the only players who have the ability to mesh with other players."
3363,2020-04-28 21:18:30,g93d3s,"I did, but the team doesn't look as great due to Jordan taking up 45% of the budget."
3364,2020-04-27 20:09:57,g93d3s,I get there a lot of talent but even if you're making sure Rose and Iverson stagger minutes ... Look at your backups John wall a ball hog pg and taking a 30 ppg shooter in Beal who needs the bad lot neither provide much defense there either.... I get it's a lot of talent I just don't see how they play together
3365,2020-04-28 03:07:44,g93d3s,"Yeah no doubt that would be an unstoppable offense. And I definitely see the value of leaning offense over defense in this exercise; I did the same thing myself.

Of course any feedback provided is really nit-picking, I just feel like a pairing like Duncan/Robinson would tear up LeBron/Dirk on offense and be able to defend them reasonably well."
3366,2020-04-28 02:20:35,g93d3s,"Yeah I think you'd be fine on offense. Pau and Noah are both such great passers, they'd be awesome together. I could see a team with 2 or 3 stud little guys giving you some trouble, but that's nit-picking. As you said it's impossible to build a 100% perfect team. After looking at everyone's on here yours is my favorite (aside from my own of course haha)."
3367,2020-04-28 18:50:31,g93d3s,"They are based on an adp based on how a player would fit and play on a modern team, look man what some of these players did for their era is great but let's be honest."
3368,2020-04-29 03:44:11,g93d3s,"I honestly only skimmed the rules but assumed the positions was just for formatting/organizational purpose to help us look for players. But yeah if you stick with a PF, Siakam definitely helps the team get up and down better with his speed and ball handling advantages over Bosh."
3369,2020-04-28 15:30:14,g93d3s,"I mean I wouldn't trust smart against MJ but I do think the fit is far better and he's a tough tenacious defender, there are better defenders for $3 but definitely far better team imo"
3370,2020-04-28 21:30:12,g93d3s,"I'm against either... I think you should choose seasons played for your team. But, fair enough."
3371,2020-04-27 20:36:07,g93d3s,"It's a fair point, if I took more time I might find a way to make a better team but as is I would take my chances with this team."
3372,2020-04-28 12:18:29,g93d3s,Hence why I did go Dennis rodman because he can handle his own on Robinson. So it then be  Dirk vs Duncan and they have had great matchups and then there's Lebron.  To account for
3373,2020-04-28 21:18:58,g93d3s,"The ""how would old school players fit into today's game"" debate is super fascinating to me. I think you need to take it on a case-by-case basis. I think guys with athleticism like Chamberlain, Robertson, Baylor, Hayes would have little trouble adapting given some time. Maravich would be an interesting case as his skillset was way ahead of his time. I do tend to agree on the bigs like Mikan and Pettit, and the scrappy high IQ guys like Cowens or Schayes. But you're getting all these guys at such a discount in this exercise; there's definitely some value to be had in having their intangibles on the end of your bench."
3374,2020-04-29 03:51:11,g93d3s,"Indeed, indeed. What about your squad my guy?"
3375,2020-04-29 05:10:36,g93d3s,"(Double post, my b). For sure. Stayed up later than I should working on this haha (eastern time), but I've got it:

**Starting 5**

Dwyane Wade $31 (2006 version)

Klay Thompson  $23

Carmelo Anthony $18 (Nuggs of course)

PJ Tucker $2

Chris Bosh $15 (2014-15)

**Bench**

Raymond Felton $1 (Charlotte)

Donovan Mitchell $2

Andres Nocioni $1 (2006-07)

Kristaps Porzingis $5

Jusuf Nurkic $2

I think the offense would be insane in that starting 5. First off, as you already noted, Melo was an *elite* scorer in his prime. Wade in 2006 was also averaging 30 PPG and was a menace going to the rim and I think he showed enough playmaking to be the primary ball handler here. Giving him this kind of spacing, with a capable 3P shooter at every other spot including one of the best of all time in Klay, would be so difficult to stop. For defense: you have an excellent defense backcourt, Tucker can take the tougher forward match-up (and it's not like prime Melo was shit on D), and Bosh as a solid, versatile inside-out defender. 

For the bench: Mitchell doesn't fit that well here, but he's just so talented for $2 freaking dollars that I'll take him. Felton is there because I think the team needs one guy with the handle and shiftiness to get in the lane and kick, as well as put pressure run the pick and roll with the vision to pass out of it in addition to scoring ability. Wish he was a better 3 shooter but I can live with it. Nocioni is out of left field but his best years in Chicago were pretty good and he was a high% 3P shooter on low/medium volume. Porzingis can come off the bench and stretch the floor like few other 7+ footers in NBA history, and Nurkic is there in case we have to deal with Shaq or another elite big man since Bosh and Porzingis are nowhere near as strong as Nurk."
3376,2020-04-29 05:38:03,g93d3s,"Lmao sorry man, didn‚Äôt wanna take away from your sleep. But this team certainly is very tough. You have close to, just not as elite, the level of shooting of my team. But, you remedy the glaring problem my team has: no slasher. Wade is an underrated pick up especially as the primary ball handler, he‚Äôs basically free to do what he wants with all the spacing you have AND he‚Äôs a top backcourt defender. Don‚Äôt need to go over Klay much, historically great shooter and wing defender. Melo, PJ, and Bosh we both agree on. Your bench is what‚Äôs very interesting to me though. Not in a bad way, but interesting because it goes in so many places lmao. Mitchell is ball dominant and not the best spot up shooter, alongside Felton who has a tendency to overdribble and the twin tower duo of Nurk and KP is also very intriguing. Once again, not in a bad way, I‚Äôm just picturing how it would play out. Also, Nocioni is such a sleeper and great pick up, wow. Did that just randomly come to your mind? Haven‚Äôt heard that name in a while lol. 

Overall, your team is wayyy more well-rounded than mine. We live and die by the three so if we go cold, which will eventually happen, that‚Äôs a wrap lol."
3377,2020-04-29 13:36:43,g93d3s,"No worries, I would've still been surfing reddit or youtube anyways haha. This exercise was fun. I'm glad you see my starting 5 the same way, I do feel like I covered all my bases or slashing, spacing, playmaking, interior and perimeter D. And I noticed Tucker by looking at your team; such as a good value.

I see what you're saying about the bench. One thing though is I would never play Nurk and KP together; I would play one of them with Bosh or with Melo/Nocioni as a small 4. With Nurk, I grabbed him last; it'd have been more conventional to grab a forward but I wanted a physical big to potentially deal with Shaq, Alonzo Mourning, Dwight Howard, etc. He's probably the ""10th man"" in this case. I'm kind of rethinking the Mitchell pick; he's obviously a great player for $2, but you're right that he's a bit ball dominant to be on a team that already has plenty of scorers and a ball handler off the bench like Felton.

Not entirely sure where I came up with Nocioni; I vaguely remember him playing back in the day and I always thought he was really good when I watched him. Upon looking up his stats, he wasn't quite the scorer I remembered but as an accurate 3P shooter who can handle the ball some and play both forward spots, I like him on the squad for a $1. 

>Overall, your team is wayyy more well-rounded than mine. We live and die by the three so if we go cold, which will eventually happen, that‚Äôs a wrap lol.

Mine's is more well-rounded, but i don't think the gap is too bad since at least you can bring some really good defenders off the bench. Agree you guys could easily go cold and then lose when your starters' defense doesn't hold up that well, but if you hit around 40-45% of your 3's on a given night (by no means unlikely, considering Curry and KAT) while pushing the pace, you'd score 140 some nights even against a solid defensive team like what I have. Wish we could make it happen."
3378,2020-04-29 21:01:20,g93d3s,"Agreed, I felt that Mitchell and Felton was the only part of the bench that might be a little troublesome. But Nocioni is still a sleeper to me, he‚Äôd be so valued in 2020 it‚Äôs crazy. I could see him, especially with contracts going out like hot cakes these days, making 10-15 mil a year just because of the way the game is played today. And KP and Nurk is still intriguing to me as well. Nurk is a big body on defense but on offense an inside presence with even more space to consistently hit mid range pick and pops because of KP. I like it honestly. 

And yeah, I kinda see my team as the warriors without the stifling defense and even better on offense obviously. Like I said were probably the best offensive team in this thread, but I see a team like yours with more versatility and were pretty much toast on defense. Stuff like this is fun though, and you‚Äôre right only if we could see it play out lol"

3397,2020-04-26 04:49:37,g8835v,"TBH I feel like the draft was pretty ancillary for us at this point. The only MAJOR hole I think was filled by Michael Pittman. The team would have been pretty complete with or without the draft. It‚Äôll all come down to how well Philip Rivers plays. If he‚Äôs even 3/4 of what he was in 2018, they‚Äôll be in the playoffs."
3398,2020-04-26 11:39:32,g8835v,"Just curious, why do the grades get the letters they do? Most of them seem pretty arbitrary."
3399,2020-04-26 04:57:24,g8835v,Great writeup!
3400,2020-04-26 05:53:46,g8835v,i don‚Äôt like the glasgow grade. probably the best special teams player in the draft

Other than that, pretty solid draft."

3404,2020-04-26 18:51:48,g8835v,"The grades are my own, and therefore arbitrary and subjective.

Pittman gets an A because he was one of my favorite receivers, he fits Reich's offense, and I wanted the Colts to take him.

Taylor gets an A- because he is an immediate impact player who should be incredible behind our line. But I take a little bit away because (personal preference) I don't like drafting RBs that high.

Blackmon gets a B because he's a great player and a ballhawk (9 INTs, 20 PBUs, 2 FFs), but he is also coming off of an ACL tear. Solid pick, but some injury concern.

Eason gets a B+ for value. If he'd been picked in the 2nd, I'd have given it a D at best. But getting a developmental QB with some elite traits, who most people (myself included) thought would be a third rounder at worst, in the fourth round is great value.

Pinter gets a B- because, while he's a fine player, I felt their were better linemen on the board at that spot.

Windsor gets a C because I didn't think he was more than a 7th round prospect at best, and feel like he's the most likely pick to not make the team.

Rodgers gets a B+ because I love his playmaking ability, but I wonder where he plays. We have the best nickel corner in the game, and Hines has earned the returner spot.

Patmon gets a B+ because he's a bit of a project (and has a problem with drops), but a good one, with great athleticism, who should at least contribute in the red zone.

Glasgow gets a C because he's a special teamer who I didn't think would be drafted.

The Buckner trade gets an A for obvious reasons.

The 2019 Redskins trade gets an A- for the Colts moving down and still getting the guy they wanted. I would have taken Sweat though.

The Browns trade gets a B+ because we didn't give up much (and made it up later), although, as mentioned, I personally wouldn't take a back that high.

The Lions trade gets an A because we we got a good return, including getting a higher 5th rounder than the one we traded to the Browns.

The Patriots trade gets a B- because we traded with the Patsies. Boo.

The Wilson trade gets a C- because, while I get that his time on the team was over and it's good that we got something for him, at the end of the day he's a former top 50 pick - and Ballard's second pick ever - and he ended up as a bust who was traded away for the 211th pick. Hard to feel too good about that.

The Texans gets a C because I liked their first two picks, but thought the other three were meh. And even the Blacklock pick is tainted by the fact that they got that pick by trading away DeAndre Hopkins for a second rounder and David Johnson, and no team gets a good grade for that.

The Glitter Kitties got a C- because, although I liked some individual picks, the more I thought about it, the more questionable I thought some of those picks were.

The Titans got a B because they grabbed two of my favorite players in this draft, Fulton and Evans. But their first round pick, Isaiah Wilson, isn't a first round talent, and a downgrade from the guy he's replacing.

And the Packers got an A+ because their draft - and their fans reaction to said draft - were hilarious to me."

3407,2020-04-26 03:06:49,g86txq,"So you spend an entire section on Jordan's failures but don't bring up LeBron's?

In fact, not only do you do that, but you make flimsy excuses for the 2011 Finals. There are ways to argue LeBron is the GOAT while acknowledging that he wasn't up to par in the 2011 Finals. Also the Mavs were not an ""all-time great team""."
3408,2020-04-26 04:43:56,g86txq,"there was a time when i thought there was some argument, but there is not. Barring an absolutely amazing late career Lebron will have to settle for being extremely rich, a hero to millions and only the 2nd greatest basketball player in history."
3409,2020-04-26 03:11:28,g86txq,After Jordan couldn't beat Magic I quit reading.
3410,2020-04-26 03:23:58,g86txq,"You could write an entire book on why you think LeBron is better than Jordan but it isn't going to change the fact that Jordan is the GOAT. 

Jordan is 6-0 in the Finals. LeBron is 3-6. 

Jordan three peated, quit for a year, then came back and three peated again, taking out multiple 60 win teams in the process. Nothing LeBron has done matches that. 

Jordan is 7-2 vs. 60 win teams in the playoffs. LeBron is 3-5.

**LeBron averaged 17ppg in the 2011 Finals, including an 8 point performance.**

Jordan won DPOY while averaging 35ppg. 9x All Defensive First Team. 6x Finals MVP. 5x league MVP. 10x Scoring Champion.  I mean, c'mon."

3420,2020-04-26 05:52:13,g86txq,"MJ is the most accomplished of all-time, LeBron is the most skilled of all-time. The latter distinction has more to do with an individual player rather than the team that player was on. That‚Äôs why when we‚Äôre ranking ‚Äúplayers‚Äù, I rank LeBron higher"
3421,2020-04-26 03:13:05,g86txq,Preach
3422,2020-04-26 03:26:00,g86txq,"Lebron still has some time to chase MJ. In 20 years, the GOAT argument between these two are going to be 95% based on accolades/stats and what they accomplished. The 5% will be the small stories, individual games/series and narratives that have transcended the years.

Playoff/Regular season stats, MVPs, All-NBA teams (O/D), Final MVPs, All-Stars, records and rings will dictate the structure of the debate. If that fails, the legend of each player will determine the GOAT which then becomes purely subjective again and we are back at square one. 

In conclusion, MJ is the GOAT at the moment but by the time Lebron‚Äôs career concludes, he will definitely have an argument based on the previously mentioned accolades/stats. However, his legend will grow as the older generation pass away. It‚Äôs what happened to Wilt‚Äôs legacy."

3482,2020-04-24 02:48:39,g70fuc,Pretty wild to see Harden so high up in this list
3483,2020-04-24 06:39:42,g70fuc,Were there any times where the MVP winner didn't have the most first place votes?
3484,2020-04-24 05:21:32,g70fuc,I think it's pretty interesting how Harden is 13th both here and in the original MVP shares. Wonder how he'll be remembered historically. I don't really see him brought up much in the all-time discussions relative to the other recent players on that list.
3485,2020-04-24 02:52:59,g70fuc,"James Harden in front of Duncan, KG, Malone and Kobe is pretty wild"
3486,2020-04-24 05:02:29,g70fuc,"You touch on it in your flaws section, but this is a highly inaccurate way to rank players.

Each season differs so much in terms of ""viable"" MVP candidates that giving too much weight to one guy based off his finish in that season makes it look like one guy is 'better' than another based off the results.

But which is more impressive from these 2 scenarios:

Season 1: 2 60-win teams, 4 50-win teams in the conference... The clear 'best' guy on the better of the 60 win teams spends a few weeks injured and only plays 62 games. 'Best' player on the 2nd 60-win team cleans up and gets .96 ""real MVP shares""

Season 2: 8 50-win teams make up the playoffs... separation between first seed and 9th is 9 games.
6 guys are in the running for the award. The guy who wins has the 'best' stats on the second seed, but only pulls in .32 ""real MVP shares"".

Imo, season 2's guy was ***immensely*** more valuable, but the stat you bring up would mark season 1's winner as 3x 'better'.

Edit: An additional problem comes from the recent trends towards consensus in voting (there was a good post on this a few days ago) that will skew this heavily towards current players going forward (e.g. Steph and Giannis will have their 2 MVPs count much more strongly than a guy with multiple MVPs from before the social media era and the voter 'accountability' that comes with it)."
3487,2020-04-24 15:18:28,g70fuc,">4 	Larry Bird 	3.430

What is amazing about this one, is that Larry basically played 7 seasons healthy in his 13 year career, the last of those 7 he was playing with the injury that would ultimately derail and ruin his career, he also won a title, league MVP, and finals MVP that year. 

A Larry Bird that wasn't cheap as fuck trying to pave his moms driveway himself has to be the one of if not the greatest what ifs in basketball history."

3494,2020-04-24 03:14:18,g70fuc,Na Harden is insane. Dude at his peak is probably a top 3 all time scorer. I can't think of anyone besides MJ I think is definitively better.

3498,2020-04-24 15:28:04,g70fuc,"These sound like real scenarios to me lol. 

Let me guess...Season 1 is 2009 LeBron? KG on the Celtics only played 57 games that year. or maybe 2019 Giannis? Kawhi only played 60 games. 

and Season 2 is 2008 Kobe? idk"
3499,2020-05-11 00:55:21,g70fuc,Larry finished top 2 in MVP voting like each of those 7 years. I‚Äôm too young to remember him but he must have been insane.

Player A gets 33% of the first place votes 64% of the second and 0% of the third. 

Player B gets 33% of the first place votes 36% of the second and 33% of the third

Player C gets 34% of the first place votes 0% of the second and 64% of the third. 

Player C is the clear best winner here? Player A seems the consensus better player."
3501,2020-04-24 03:29:33,g70fuc,What the fuck is the point of bringing that up?
3502,2020-04-24 05:56:47,g70fuc,George Yardley wins the prize for 'most MVP Votes for someone I've never heard of'.
3503,2020-04-24 10:51:30,g70fuc,MJ and possibly KD. That‚Äôs really about it. Personally I think KD is a better scorer than Harden because he relies less on what seem to be regular season foul calls and has a cleaner game to watch. Harden is an insanely good scorer though obviously
3504,2020-04-24 04:36:12,g70fuc,"Steph Curry, Kobe, Larry Bird, Kareem"

3508,2020-05-11 02:18:56,g70fuc,"He and Magic had their careers stolen from them by injuries (and Larry being cheap), and Aids, it's sad for us as fans when you think what could have been."

3512,2020-04-24 16:07:07,g70fuc,"Steph is not a better scorer. A better shooter, yes."
3513,2020-04-24 04:41:38,g70fuc,"Larry bird never broke 30 ppg nor was he even close to as efficient as harden. 

Steph you could argue had a top 3 all time peak as a scorer, but it was also one year. But he'd be up there. 


Kareem is a longevity thing. Hardens peak is higher scoring wise, though obviously he does a lot less than Kareem on the other end 

Kobe is harden volume without the efficiency"
3514,2020-04-24 03:58:14,g70fuc,Only 32 a game on 57% TS% last playoffs. What a scrub
3515,2020-04-24 03:58:22,g70fuc,"Well MVP is a regular season award, and Harden has some crazy stat lines  every season"
3516,2020-04-24 04:28:42,g70fuc,"If you ended up anything other than #2 in the MVP race, there‚Äôs a good chance you received very few first place votes."
3517,2020-04-24 20:21:31,g70fuc,"Right but then you‚Äôd miss a player like A because Player C maybe has a strong cohort of fans of his abilities and style but the consensus best player is another person.

You‚Äôre asking for a first past the post winner but I‚Äôm not convinced that‚Äôs the best approach. It‚Äôs certainly cleaner and simpler but I think it leads to suboptimal outcomes despite its elegance."
3518,2020-04-24 19:52:15,g70fuc,"I disagree.  Scoring is all about how many points you score and how many possessions you use to score them.  While Harden has an advantage over Steph in volume of scoring, the gap in efficiency is more significant.  

Since 2012 when Harden was traded to the Rockets, Steph averages 25.5 pts/g on 20.2 true shot attempts/g (best easily accessible measure of possessions used), a TS% of 63.3%.  Harden averages 29.6 pts/g on 24.2 TSA/g, a TS% of 61.1%.  so the difference is that Harden scores 4.03 pts/g more and takes 4.04 more TSA/g .  

So Harden is providing ~4 more points and using ~4 more possessions a game to do so, at an efficiency just under 50% TS.  This is well below replacement level efficiency, so one would expect that a team would be better off with 4 fewer points and 4 additional possessions.  

Additionally, while obviously as Steph has to take more shots we would expect his TS% to decline, I think everyone would expect Steph to hit above 50% TS if he used 4 additional possessions a game.  So it is reasonable to think Steph could match or better Harden's numbers if he wanted to increase his volume.

The conclusion is only made stronger as the beginning of the period of interest is moved forward from 2012."
3519,2020-04-24 04:48:55,g70fuc,"How are you defining scorer? To me, when someone is a ‚Äúscorer‚Äù it‚Äôs somebody who when their team absolutely needs a bucket they‚Äôll get you a bucket. I‚Äôd take the guys I mentioned above Harden every time. If we‚Äôre just talking about who‚Äôs scoring the most then obviously Harden is higher."
3520,2020-04-24 04:04:37,g70fuc,"Let's use his Houston numbers all time, it's 62% TS in the regular season which is 5% worse, and his eFG% drops by 3.5%


So still very good, but compared to regular season it's not close, regular season wise he is insane and top 3 ever, but playoffs he is not"
3521,2020-04-24 04:39:46,g70fuc,Yeah you‚Äôre right. Now that I‚Äôve read it carefully it only refers to 1st place votes. At first I thought it was MVP shares in general. Kobe is very low though
3522,2020-04-24 04:09:38,g70fuc,"It's still insane playoffs wise man.
There's only 8 other people in NBA history to do that (10 games minimum)

MJ, Lebron, Kareem, KD, Jerry West, Oscar Robertson, Adrian Dantley, and Bernard King

That's a damn good list to be on"
3523,2020-04-24 04:43:59,g70fuc,"That drop is due to who he faced in the playoffs.

Utah and GS were arguably 2 of the best defensive teams in the league, and they sold out trying to specifically stop him.

If he had gone up against Denver and Portland instead (just as an example), there's a good chance he doesn't see a similar dip.

In fact, when broken down by series, we can see that the drop-off against GS was very minimal, whereas Utah's decision to take away the step back and passing lanes and force him into the DPotY was very effective.

All numbers need context behind them.

Most of this sub refuses to acknowledge that."
3524,2020-04-24 08:36:08,g70fuc,"Because Kobe was at the very top for a long time, but didn't really have many seasons where he was the clear cut best player."
3525,2020-04-24 04:58:52,g70fuc,"I mean, as a Rockets fan, the typical ‚Äúhater‚Äù answer is that Harden is pretty easy to gameplan around, which is honestly true.

Harden 5 years ago looked like he would develop into an MJ-type scorer, ultimate green light, pulling up wherever and whenever he wants. I wish he would take more midrange nowadays, post moves, fade-aways. It‚Äôs definitely in his bag, but he‚Äôs just focused more on working on his step back, which is a cheat code in itself, but like I said, it‚Äôs easier to gameplan around than someone like MJ/Kobe who can pull up and get 2 points at will. Imagine the fouls he would get, too."
3526,2020-04-24 05:16:23,g70fuc,"Harden still drives. He uses his floater, lays it up, occasionally dunks or pulls up, and frequently sets up teammates.

Between that and the step-back, he has more than enough variety in his shot selection.

The problems arise when refs stop calling fouls or teammates can't hit shots. And that's it.

Otherwise there is nothing wrong with the Rockets approach. It would be nice if he wouldn't keep shooting on cold nights (although MDA approves of it, so it's hard to blame James when the coach is telling him to shoot out of the slump), but if other guys aren't hitting either, then someone has to shoot, and it may as well be him. 

The thing that has killed the Rockets the most over the last 2 playoffs is simply the refs not blowing whistles on the same contact they've called all season long."
3527,2020-04-24 05:17:48,g70fuc,"I can agree with the refs being shit. Like ""how is this happening on national TV"" shit"
3528,2020-04-22 18:41:25,g66ptl,Fun fact this was originally supposed to be made 25 years ago with Keanu Reeves but it didn't work out and fell into development hell for a while. Apparently he was offered $7M but turned it down.

3530,2020-04-22 18:54:01,g66ptl,Taylor Sheridan is the intriguing bit here.
3531,2020-04-22 19:45:57,g66ptl,"I hate being that ‚Äúbook versus movie‚Äù guy.... the book is gripping.  It‚Äôs fantastic.  It‚Äôs also as much a drama, filled with head games as much as action.

Most of Clancy‚Äôs original work is like that, and the older movies managed to capture it well.  Then 2002 hit and a modern shooting of Sum of All Fears botched it.  Here‚Äôs to hoping they take notes on what the older movies got right."
3532,2020-04-22 18:43:12,g66ptl,Taylor Sheridan adapting this has me interested.
3533,2020-04-22 20:05:52,g66ptl,"Boy this sounded real generic and boiler plate as far as action movies go, but the written by Taylor Sheridan caught my attention. Wind River and Sicario are some of my favorite movies of the last few years."
3534,2020-04-22 19:23:08,g66ptl,Damn I didn't know they were making this a movie. The book is insanely good.

3537,2020-04-22 21:35:48,g66ptl,"And here we are, decades later in a world with actual Russian villainy, and *still* no ***Red Storm Rising*** film.

With Taylor Sheridan, I'm cautiously optimistic."
3538,2020-04-22 19:59:03,g66ptl,"I haven't ready Without Remorse yet, but I see the character is ""Clarke"". Is it set in the Jack Ryan universe in (in which William Defoe played 'Clarke' in Clear and Present Danger)?"
3539,2020-04-22 18:57:22,g66ptl,"Michael B Jordan is one of those actors that has to convince me he‚Äôs a good actor with every single role. And then he‚Äôs good in the role, I say ‚Äúhey he‚Äôs a good actor‚Äù, and then the next movie comes out and I have to be convinced all over again. It‚Äôs very strange. I also feel this way about Ryan Gosling."
3540,2020-04-22 19:24:58,g66ptl,"I‚Äôve been working my way through the Jack Ryan books since January - I‚Äôve just finished Executive Orders this morning. 

Michael B Jordan is not how I picture John Clark - I‚Äôve always pictured him as more of a Liev Schreiber. 

But then I always pictured Killmonger as... someone else. Jordan nailed that one to the point I can‚Äôt remember who, so.... make of that what you will."
3541,2020-04-22 20:23:01,g66ptl,He should played a character where his younger brother got killed by a Baltimore drug lord because he was accused of snitching
3542,2020-04-22 21:41:44,g66ptl,It is really hard that retirement keeps getting pushed back. Poor Tom Clancy has been dead for 7 years and he's still expected to show up to work.
3543,2020-04-23 06:26:23,g66ptl,Michael B Jordan is all wrong. Pass.
3544,2020-04-23 00:22:59,g66ptl,"One of my favorite books, though I lost all interest when Jordan was announced as Clark. I just can't see how he's going to be anything remotely like Clark from the books. But Sheridan being involved is news to me, that makes me hopeful."
3545,2020-04-22 19:46:03,g66ptl,It's a shame they are changing the main character so much. I wonder if it'll bother fans like the Jack Reacher films did
3546,2020-04-22 18:59:45,g66ptl,"There the fuck is Wallace.

Also, it's amazing Tom Clancy is able to put his name on stuff years after his death. The man works!"
3547,2020-04-22 20:38:03,g66ptl,"Sheridan's the shit, ma dudes. Sucks this is delayed."
3548,2020-04-22 23:14:13,g66ptl,pictured Mel Gibson as Mr. Clark when I was reading the novel

3550,2020-04-23 02:51:49,g66ptl,loved Willem Dafoe's depiction of clark in clear and present danger. I hope this isn't a movie about noobie learning the ropes of the CIA. We seen that trope away too many times.
3551,2020-04-23 05:40:14,g66ptl,I am out if he doesn‚Äôt drive an international scout.
3552,2020-04-23 00:32:20,g66ptl,"Canonically, John Clark/Kelly is white. Already played in the movies by Willem Dafoe.  Bold recasting.  Hope it works out well.  The girlfriend in the book wasnt killed by a drug lord, but was an escaped hooker killed by her pimp."
3553,2020-04-23 00:19:06,g66ptl,"I think MB Jordan and Keanu would both be horrible miscasts.

When I think Clark, I think head like a paint can.

Liev Schreiber was close.

Did they also bamboozle the timeframe?

I really don't care about the race of John Clark. I might be interested if they made him Asian AND kept the Vietnam setting, that would definitely explain why he did one tour and cashed out.

Daniel Dae Kim has what I would consider a John Clark suitable jawline."
3554,2020-04-22 21:51:14,g66ptl,"Well, my prediction is that Michael B Jordan is going to handle his fucking business."
3555,2020-04-22 23:45:29,g66ptl,Holy shit I didn't know Sheridan wrote this
3556,2020-04-23 01:34:29,g66ptl,The book was great.  Holding out hope the movie comes close.
3557,2020-04-23 14:13:51,g66ptl,That sounds like the plot of a Steven Seagal movie.

3608,2020-04-23 06:46:15,g66ptl,I don‚Äôt know anyone but myself who enjoyed Sum of All Fears. I watched it again on TV the other day (it had been a decade or so) and still think it‚Äôs a solid movie.
3609,2020-04-23 04:49:30,g66ptl,I hope I‚Äôm wrong but I think Michael B Jordan is a terrible pick for John Clark. I know he‚Äôs too old now but Liev Schrieber was the best person to play him. Had that toughness and attitude that was just right. Willem Dafoe was a little too frail and gaunt for a superior warrior. Not sure now who would be a good pick.

Team Yankee is a good companion piece if you liked the German set portions of the book."
3621,2020-04-23 16:38:29,g66ptl,Red Storm Rising needs to be like an 8-10 part minisireies.  Way too much going on for a movie.

3623,2020-04-22 22:09:38,g66ptl,Yes it the same John Clarke but it‚Äôs a prequel before the other books. It follows Clarke after he gets back from Vietnam. It‚Äôs a origin story of how became a spook.
3624,2020-04-22 20:13:38,g66ptl,"I read it long ago so I'm iffy on most details of the story, but yes, it's the same John Clark but this time the story is focused on him rather than Jack Ryan."
3625,2020-04-23 02:57:40,g66ptl,"It's set in the same universe, Jack Ryan's father has a small part in it."
3626,2020-04-23 03:48:11,g66ptl,It's supposed to be John Clark's origin story - way before he worked in the CIA.
3627,2020-04-23 16:37:05,g66ptl,"Yes, but he isn't Clark yet, he's John Kelly.  He is just a retired SEAL just starting to dip his toes into CIA work after his wife dies.  He comes across a drug-addicted girl forced into prostitution and drug running, cleans her up, and falls in love with her.  But her old drug bosses track her down, injure him and they kidnap and murder the girl.  So he hunts them down and kills them, while the CIA helps him fake his death and become John Clark."
3628,2020-04-22 19:30:37,g66ptl,"His best performance by far was in Creed, and I think that had a lot to do with Coogler. He‚Äôs just.... extremely one-note as far as I‚Äôm seeing. It‚Äôs like I have to squint to see his characters instead of him convincing me what he‚Äôs doing onscreen is actually happening."
3629,2020-04-22 19:50:47,g66ptl,"Maybe this is how I feel. Anytime someone mentions him, I just go, meh he's ok. I don't know how to explain it, but from Fruitvale Station to Black Panther, always feel like he's just reading his lines"

3633,2020-04-22 21:46:12,g66ptl,"I've said it in a few threads before, Michael B Jordan got roles that seem like they were intended for Michael Jay White. In the Black Panther film Jordan was again generic or bland most of the time and the personality he gave his character didn't fit their history for the most part, unless Navy Seals who operated on every continent act like angsty teenagers."

3635,2020-04-23 21:12:37,g66ptl,"Same. ""Made by the guy who did Wind River"" is the only reason the movie sounds interesting and not another terrible Tom Clancy movie that only kinda sorta follows the book."

3641,2020-04-23 04:04:52,g66ptl,"The book was not about the CIA, as I recall.  It actually stands out in contrast to most of the Jack Ryan stories and spinoffs."
3642,2020-04-23 21:18:06,g66ptl,"Dafoe's version wasn't anything remotly like the book. Clarke is a CIA wetwork guy, not some contractor.

&nbsp;

In the book, Clarke is John Kelly,  a SEAL who gets recruited for a POW rescue because he's somewhat familiar with the area due to pulling a downed pilot out of the area.

The rescue is eventually blown by a mole, but the CIA starts realizing what Clarke is up to and helps him fake is death, after which he takes the ""John Clarke"" name.

&nbsp;

Interestingly, in *Debt of Honor* he runs into one of the Coast Guardsmen who knew him as ""Kelly""."
3643,2020-04-23 05:42:38,g66ptl,"Who also used his prostitutes as mules, because he WAS a drug lord, if memory serves."
3644,2020-04-23 05:43:48,g66ptl,Interesting to see how they write it into the period setting of the 70s? Wasn't there still some prejudice against African Americans during that period?
3645,2020-04-23 06:39:54,g66ptl,"Canonically, John Clark/Kelly is a master of disguise, easily able to slip into and out of any country in the world.  So who is to say if he was really white or if that's just what he wanted you to believe."
3646,2020-04-22 20:23:42,g66ptl,"Just about the only way you could get away with a Navy seal serial-killing mostly black drug-dealers nowadays.  ""Hey, it's not racist if they're both black"""
3647,2020-04-23 16:59:02,g66ptl,"I also read the book many years ago. I seem to remember the story taking place at an earlier point of John Clark's life. If so, then a 30 something actor may be best suited for the role."
3648,2020-04-23 04:05:40,g66ptl,The book it's based on was written like 35 years ago.

3662,2020-04-22 22:48:19,g66ptl,Jordon is 5'10 and lean. No worse of a choice than Keanu appearance wise.

Many books are not at all suited for the movie medium, mini series or full series with book series is a much better story telling device than the compressed format of a cinemalength movie."
3670,2020-04-23 16:24:20,g66ptl,"Red Storm Rising was so ahead of its time.  Islamic Terrorism, false flag operations, and wars over oil before it was cool.  One of the few works to consider a non-nuclear conventional war with the Soviets, rather than a nuclear stalemate.  Too bad the F-19A was never a thing, but the F-117 served the same purpose.  

It would make for a brilliant HBO miniseries."
3671,2020-05-21 13:41:40,g66ptl,DUDE. Amazing what a pair of Fives can do.
3672,2020-04-22 20:05:47,g66ptl,"Yeah!  In the book, the bomb went off, but it was kind of a dud.  I‚Äôll get my terminology wrong, but it was something like they tried to build an H bomb but ended up getting it wrong and only the A bomb part worked."
3673,2020-04-23 05:31:25,g66ptl,"I‚Äôve felt that way since it was announced that he got the role. Not only does he look nothing like Clark from the books (obviously), but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a particularly good actor, either."
3674,2020-04-23 03:45:12,g66ptl,"IiRC, US naval intelligence actually had to take a closer background look at Clancy after ""Hunt for Red October"" was published. He did such great homework and research for the book that a lot of the info and details he wrote in it were so accurate that they feared he managed to get his hands on classified info about submarine ops."
3675,2020-04-23 14:13:41,g66ptl,I love all of those books but it was obvious after Rainbow Six he wasn't writing them anymore. He may have written 20% or less starting with Bear and the Dragon. The tone of the books completely shifted after that book.
3676,2020-04-22 20:05:14,g66ptl,Sicario 2 was *fine*. It had the impossible task of following Sicario. I think it‚Äôs best to imagine them as different universes.
3677,2020-04-23 01:00:13,g66ptl,"It was the script that let Sicario 2 down. Best way to describe it is it was almost a remake of the first film. Alejandro broke into the house of the drug lord who killed his family at the end of the first film and at the end of the original script for 2. 

The rest of the film was fine, but Sheridan fucked up by giving it the same ending as the first. It's why the real ending feels so abrupt. It was never meant to end with Alejandro driving away from the river after being shot, it was meant to end with him storming the mansion and killing the drug lord.

The director did a good job, the fault here lies with Sheridan for being lazy and not coming up with a better ending to begin with."
3678,2020-04-22 22:22:19,g66ptl,Sheridan was the guy on the horse during the dust storm talking about his kids not wanting to be farmers btw. I love the heck out of that film. Easily top 20 of the decade for me.
3679,2020-04-23 04:00:44,g66ptl,Before Clancy went full rah rah lunatic. The later books were chock full of his dog brain political hot takes. Earlier ones were much nicer. Good guy kills bad guys. Simple.
3680,2020-04-23 01:26:29,g66ptl,"Without Remorse is going to be an adaptation of one of Clancy's novels, while Shadow Recruit was not."
3681,2020-04-23 03:06:44,g66ptl,"I don't think Shadow Recruit is very relevant to the potential quality of Without Remorse.

It's not the same production team, not the same writer, and not the same director. Shadow Recruit isn't even based on a Tom Clancy book.

If anything, we should be pointing out the director, who doesn't exactly have a stellar track record."
3682,2020-04-23 02:11:32,g66ptl,"I did fall asleep watching Shadow Recruit, and it was early morning after coffee. I did rewatch it again and it was..okaayy, very generic."

3684,2020-04-22 22:00:07,g66ptl,I also thought Rainbow Six would work better as a series than a movie.

Had it fucking coming."
3686,2020-04-23 03:27:11,g66ptl,"I'll never forget the improvised pipe-shotgun he created, and the description Clancy gives of the result."
3687,2020-04-23 04:52:58,g66ptl,"Red Storm Rising is my all time favorite book, with Rainbow Six a class Sr second. I think there‚Äôd be a good charm to keep it set in the 80s. The change in communications and technology would make it a little more boring because they would use cyber attacks and drones for too many plot points. Having to fly in stealth fighters with pilots gave the story higher stakes."
3688,2020-04-23 02:36:11,g66ptl,If you liked both of those check out Red Metal. It basically reads like a more modern Red Storm Rising.
3689,2020-04-23 16:27:59,g66ptl,"Just to be clear, Team Yankee wasn't part of the Red Storm Rising scenario, but Hackett's ""The Third World War""."

3695,2020-04-23 21:14:35,g66ptl,"Not even just the race swap part, I just don't think he's going to embody Clark whatsoever from a personality standpoint. Idk hopefully it'll turn out good but I have little hope now."
3696,2020-04-22 20:11:51,g66ptl,"I don't think he would have been as successful moving around in Russia if he wasn't white.

On the other hand it's a movie so who cares what color the characters are?"
3697,2020-04-22 20:18:10,g66ptl,"He definitely does. And it's not necessarily that he's black, but it's changing the character from a white, large muscular guy doing shady shit in Vietnam to a black, shorter guy doing normal stuff in the modern military."
3698,2020-04-22 23:32:07,g66ptl,I'm like 99.9% certain that Mr. Clark is described as white. Pretty sure it's in *Without Remorse* where he goes up against Baltimore drug lords. But it could also be in *Rainbow Six* with the playful rivalry with his Latino son-in-law.
3699,2020-04-23 00:52:01,g66ptl,Clarke was described as being born in Indianapolis to Irish American Catholic parents.  It's hard to be more white than that.
3700,2020-04-22 19:18:24,g66ptl,"Still, to put out movies and games years after his passing, that‚Äôs productivity. But I don‚Äôt see him in ads the way I see Harland Sanders, so points to Colonel Sanders."

You can't fake being white."

3705,2020-04-22 23:18:45,g66ptl,Speed and Speed 2 have to be the biggest gap in RT scores between an original film and its sequel. Speed is at 94%. Speed 2 is at 4%.
3706,2020-04-22 22:17:04,g66ptl,Willem Dafoe was the only one who looked to be enjoying themselves on that abysmal film
3707,2020-04-22 23:18:49,g66ptl,"Slings & Arrows is such a terrific show. I had no clue that the first season was inspired by Keanu doing Hamlet, but it makes total sense."

3717,2020-04-23 16:44:23,g66ptl,Umm bud all of that was completely contemporary to when the book was published.
3718,2020-04-22 23:29:53,g66ptl,There's an entire chapter describing what happens in the 30 nanoseconds after the bomb detonates. You can be forgiven for getting a few details wrong.
3719,2020-04-22 21:00:20,g66ptl,"In the book the tritium needed to ignite the second stage, was tainted. It was the last thing the ex-east German scientist had planned to do before declaring the bomb finished, but he was killed."

3721,2020-04-23 16:22:40,g66ptl,"He did partner up with other writers, but to me it was where he let his politics influence his writing such that both sides were caricatures - his good guys honest and upright, beyond reproach, and the bad guys all craven morons.  At best, it's lazy."
3722,2020-04-23 01:54:37,g66ptl,"It‚Äôs bad. I fooled myself for a few weeks telling myself that it was just ‚Äúfine‚Äù. It‚Äôs actually appalling and so so so far from the realism that Villenueve‚Äôs film portrayed. Solima did do something recently that I liked though. It‚Äôs a mini series on Amazon Prime called *ZeroZeroZero*. Covers one shipment of cocaine gone wrong. Takes place in Mexico with the Los Zetas cartel (the most intriguing part), the Mafia in Italy (also interesting), and America (interesting, but relatively unrealistic storyline). All these ends meet at the end. Pretty fun, definitely check it out. Solima has more freedom from studio executives here."
3723,2020-04-23 16:42:27,g66ptl,It was a disaster and that has nothing to do with what it was a sequel of.
3724,2020-04-23 14:33:46,g66ptl,Sicario 2 was not fine lol. It was completely unnecessary.
3725,2020-04-23 00:48:56,g66ptl,"But they're not different universes, its a sequel. And the sequel is fucking garbage."

3729,2020-04-23 03:11:29,g66ptl,"I'd say Shadow Recruit and the Jack Ryan series are both on about the same wavelength, and that is what I personally, am wary about.

That we'll get more like that.

I will admit I liked that the one guy who drove the boat was saddled with the nickname ""Uber"". You don't pick your nickname, the people who hate/love you do."
3730,2020-04-23 02:28:15,g66ptl,"Yeah, there's not much of a plot in that book.  The good guys just sort of stumble onto the evil plan 4/5 of the way through the book and kill all the bad guys."
3731,2020-04-23 14:11:49,g66ptl,"Oh man. Honestly I think that scene is a litmus test for the whole movie: if they include it, its gonna be great, if not then it will be ""fine"" at best. It's just so integral to Kelly's character, it's a method of torture that fits his skillset perfectly, while also being super specific and horrible. 

Not that I think that scene in particular will make or break the movie, just that a willingness to include it means the people making the movie are willing to take the book to the bleak-ass place it needs to go. I hope they do right by portagee too. What a great portrayal of that... sort of professional friendship that happens between people in similar lines of work, especially the military."

3749,2020-04-23 16:55:22,g66ptl,"There were some that saw the signs, but it was hardly in the public consciousness.  1986 very few people were worried about Islamic terrorism or wars over oil.  Detroit gave Saddam Hussein a key to the city in 1980.

3755,2020-04-23 14:14:52,g66ptl,"Exactly. If they follow the book as written and also set it in the 1970s, it'll be amazing. 

If they update it so that it's modern day and it's the War in Afghanistan, it'll be a stinker."
3756,2020-04-23 03:18:55,g66ptl,"> I'd say Shadow Recruit and the Jack Ryan series are both on about the same wavelength

Without Remorse is set in the same universe as Jack Ryan, but the story is way different to the Jack Ryan books. It's far more personal and with less spycraft and geopolitics."
3757,2020-04-23 02:36:50,g66ptl,"Sort of, the majority of the plot isn't Team Rainbow. It follows the Horizon Corp as the prepare the virus. Follows the test subjects and the FBI investigation. Then there is the former KBI Popov and his terrorist contacts.  A movie couldn't give enough run time to play out those plotlines with the Team Rainbow plot as the main thread.

I could see them doing two seasons following the book, with the Terrorist takedowns being the high points of the seasons."
3758,2020-04-23 04:03:02,g66ptl,"> The good guys just sort of stumble onto the evil plan 4/5 of the way through 

Only because the guy set up as the big bad realized how crazy the actual big bad was and spilled the beans. Rainbow Team has essentially zero impact on the actual plot of the book until they get to the last 50 or so pages of the story.

The action scenes are a thrill ride but boy was that a stupid book."
3759,2020-05-22 04:07:15,g66ptl,I actually read Red Phoenix before Red Metal. Red Phoenix felt so unorganized. Everything just happens and then it‚Äôs over. Didn‚Äôt feel any sense of flow or time in that book. Overall not terrible but not great either
3760,2020-04-22 23:42:38,g66ptl,"I think that it's more a flaw if the movies, but Harrison's (brief) performance in Apocalypse Now always sold me on the analyst role, and I think he could have done it if the movies really gave him a chance to go full analyst."

3767,2020-04-23 00:55:32,g66ptl,"Harrison is perfect as Ryan. In without remorse John Kelly, later Clark, was a very muscular guy. And very stoic nature. Dafoe threw me off in that movie of what i expected. Dafoe is gangly and almost has a sinister appearence, that would seem to enjoy the wet work. whereas in the book john only enjoyed the revenge in without remorse. Everything else was just a job."
3768,2020-04-23 13:55:24,g66ptl,Agreed. I've read every book and in my head that's who I picture as well while reading those books.
3769,2020-04-23 22:22:30,g66ptl,"Three years before 1986 the bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut already put the spectre of Islamic terrorism and suicide bombing in the public eye. The Americans were also guarding oil tankers in the Persian Gulf at the time from attacks from the Iranians and the Iraqis. Oil was already an issue for well over a decade because of the 1973 OPEC embargo. 

The point being, none of the themes were particularly novel in the 1980s - there were also a lot of contemporary works at the time that covered similar themes (The Third World War: The Untold Story, Team Yankee, and even Red Army where the Soviets win). What Clancy did differently was that his narrative was more colorful and filled with scenes that would translate well to other mediums like movies and video games."

It has moments where you can clearly feel the genius of the previous works, but I can also feel that he lost something. I've still got about 300 pages left, so perhaps my thoughts will change.

Havlicek > Harden until Harden wins a ring or more MVPs.

Bob Lanier or Jerry Lucas have an argument over Kawhi, but I'd probably keep Kawhi.

For V, I think Kiki Vandeweghe has a better argument than Vucevic, and maybe even Keith Van Horn and Nick Van Exel. I'd say Kiki.

3849,2020-06-23 08:50:49,he316k,"The entire Bible is apocryphal, your usage of the term is heavily bias. The actual evidence shows none of them(Bible and apocryphal books) is reliable and certainly not reliable enough to point to anything later and claim it wrong because it doesn't conform to the Church's decision on those book to label them apocryphal. 

An example of this.

The business card sized and oldest piece of the Bible, P1(?, actually P52), shows that the next earliest added in words, two in fact, meaning the second oldest piece of the Bible has forgery if compared with the oldest piece. It's not a small variant either, like a misspelling or small added detail, it actually changes one's belief if they base their belief off of the Bible. Granted most Christians don't base them off the Bible. The only other defense to be offered is that this is only one piece being compared with one piece so not the strongest of cross referencing happening here, BUT it's a common theme in researching the manuscripts of the Bible and it happens again and again that the only defense anyone has is ""that doesn't change my fundamental beliefs"", which as pointed out above is basically a no duh statement because I didn't think their fundamental beliefs were actually based on the Book anyway.

Perhaps as an atheist one shouldn't be giving the label apocryphal to certain books while not to others when given a basic neutral standard of verification all of it would fail such a standard. That should be how one goes about judging them i.e. which is reliable information. The way it's done here is clearly bias in leaning on Christian tradition as truth when it doesn't pass that basic test. Pass the basic test then lean on it as truth.

Now the Quran on the other hand, it wouldn't fail that basic standard. It's fully traceable with names, chains, and dates. It actually passes that basic standard of verification and more. 

This shows how the approach is bias and that if one takes it in a neutral way that one can only conclude the Bible is just as apocryphal as the other books whereas with the Quran no such statement can be honestly and accurately made. The whole arguments premise should not be relying on ""evidence""/scripture that doesn't pass that test."
3850,2020-06-23 13:57:42,he316k,"Hello OP, 

&#x200B;

for muslims and those who have basic knowledge know that in islam we believe that the previous scriptures are from God, they were altered and there are definetly truth in them and what ever the Quran testifies is clearly the criteria we follow. 

So you did not discover anything and we don't disagree with your premise, the stories match the previous scriptures. We don't claim that these mentionings make the Quran a clear miracle from God. We have all the information, all the arguments to argue for that without ever mentioning any Prohpets including Jesus unless you are a christian, the it comes in handy. 

But, we do argue that no illiterate man in the 7th century arabia who had little interactions with people outside Mecca, let alone with christians could not produce such a linguistically complex information that somewhat matches the subjects in the Old and new testament even tho there were no bible in Arabia that could have been read in Arabic. The Old testament is was not translated and the New testament that was in geek was translated years later.  So when we take these things in to account, we will conclude that it was not Muhammad SCW and no other man who simply came up with this. If you take away the linguistics, the illiteracy, if you show that this man lvied amongst christians and jews prior to claiming Prophethood, the reliablility really goes away but you clearly did not take these things in to account. But, we don't have to mention this part and our arguments are still valid."
3851,2020-06-29 19:15:42,he316k,"This is illogical and absurd, no Gospel or any Bible was ever in Arabic and no Christian polemical writer ever accused Islam of this for thousand years, not even one.

Syriac Infancy Gospel is European 16th-century work and was never in Arabic and most of cited Gospels came two centuries after Islam, some are direct copy of Quran itself while others are not actual Gospels but found in works of early Christian polemical work.

In short, you deploy highly fallacious and absurd premise that has zero basis of any kind and from there start making guesswork to drive to conclusion which has no merit of any kind.

Your other premise is that Mark, Matthew, Luke and John hold all truth about Jesus, a premise that Islam never accepted in the first place, so using that as some sort of measure to examine Islam is again absurd unto itself."
3852,2020-06-24 14:56:45,he316k,"It's illogical of you to say the older canonical scripture used by churches wasn't widely know but the newer non-canonical scriptures were better known. You'd think the older scripture, with its support by the Chruch would have been more widely preached. 

The thing is, the Christians never recorded Jesus' (as) mission during his lifetime. 
And they didn't preserve his words in the language he spoke. So you have a collection of stories and legends in oral circulation about the person of Jesus (as) ever since his passing. Eventually these legends got written down. Whether they were written down sooner or later does not necessarily reflect the accuracy of these legends since all these legends are based on heresay and it was the church with the most political backing that stamped the label of canon on some, and the label of heretical on others based on its own biases. A Chruch which especially leaned on the doctrines and traditions established by Paul, a man who had never even met Jesus (as)."
3853,2020-06-23 13:29:04,he316k,"Jesus had warned Israelite religious elite in Jerusalem, in Hebrew, that he is the Prince of Peace, also the last Book will be given to their sister clan. Not because Jesus decided so, but God had informed about all of these decisions centuries ago and placed in the Torah.

Meccans knew the about all Prophets, including the Jesus. Because Mecca was the religious center of the world, the Jerusalem was a city special for Israelites, as God didn't send another religion like Judaism or Christianity. Muslim leaders made Jerusalem the place we see on Fox News, as part of their political battle.

Stories from Bible are repeated then corrected in Quran, because God confirms what has been given to Jesus as well as Jesus' life story. Such as, the cave dwellers have nothing to do Ephesus:

Ephesus was a pagan center, and Paul, like his partners, was not following Jesus' teachings. Paul had visited Ephesus because he was busy creating a deity named ""messiah"", so that Roman Empire gather his firepower for Paul's allies on purpose. Paul had visited other pagan religious centers also, and he sanctified those spots. Because people needed to be converted to new Roman religion. There are tiny chapels by the entrance of these pilgrimage sites. The structures in those areas predates many Roman and Eastern Roman rulers.

You can deny Quran in shorter way, but be warned God owns all the wisdom and there is no need to resist God's Book if He sent it to somebody outside your comfort zone or people talk about arguments from previous Books.

You need to deny Torah and Gospel and Ginzah and Gatha to simply deny Quran."
3854,2020-06-23 00:43:32,he316k,"The Qur‚Äôan presents itself as the¬†literal¬†speech of God (9:16) and asserts that nothing like it will ever be produced (17:88).

**Say, ""If mankind and the jinn gathered in order to produce the like of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like of it, even if they were to each other assistants.**""

## Dimensions of inimitability

## 1. A literary masterpiece

Whether we consult the highest authorities of the Arabic language in early Arabia, or its foremost experts among academics today, there is consensus on the literary uniqueness of the Qur‚Äôan. Professor Martin Zammit, the author of¬†*A Comparative Lexical Study of Qur‚Äôanic Arabic*, says, ‚ÄúNotwithstanding¬†the literary excellence of some of the long pre-Islamic poems‚Ä¶ the Qur‚Äôan is definitely on a level of its own as the most eminent written manifestation of the Arabic language.‚Äù

During the Prophet‚Äôs Ô∑∫ time, Arabs were people who valued language¬†almost¬†as much as life itself.\[3\]¬†Before Islam, they would derogatorily call non-Arabs¬†* øajam*¬†(literally: silent or speechless), implying that others were not equally alive, or were deficient, since they could not articulate with the same lucidity and emotiveness. To further illustrate the ‚Äúlanguage = life‚Äù paradigm they held to, the 11th-century poet Ibn Rashƒ´q (d. 463 AH) says,

>**Whenever a poet emerged in an Arab tribe, other tribes would come to congratulate, feasts would be prepared, the women would join together on lutes as they do at weddings, and old and young men would all rejoice at the good news‚Äîfor this was a shield for their honor, a defense of their lineages, and an immortalization of their triumphs. The Arabs used to congratulate each other only on the birth of a child and when a poet rose among them.**

Such festivities were expected since ‚Äúold Arabic poetry is a highly complex phenomenon. The vocabulary, grammatical idiosyncrasies, and strict norms were passed down from generation to generation, and only the most gifted students fully mastered the language. A person had to study for years, sometimes even decades, under a master poet before laying claim to the title of poet.‚Äù\[5\]¬†Everyone else was validated by what they retained in memory of these odes and speeches that captured the history, morals, and wisdoms of this otherwise¬†primitive¬†desert civilization.

Thus was the historical context within which the Qur‚Äôan was revealed; it descended in the midst of people at the pinnacle of rhetorical expression. Virtually overnight, these same people experience a Qur‚Äôan from Muhammad Ô∑∫ that is pure in its Arabic, unprecedented in its eloquence, but mysteriously independent of the poetry or prose they knew and mastered. The prideful Arabs could not explain how they collectively failed its challenge to produce a single chapter with merely ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù literary features, according to their own biased judges, when its shortest chapter is only ten words (108:1-3), when they were the masters of Arabic, and when Muhammad Ô∑∫ brought over 6,000 verses of it. But that was not all. What dealt the killer blow to the Prophet‚Äôs opponents in this standoff, leaving absolutely no room for further doubt, was the fact that he Ô∑∫ was illiterate to begin with. As Allah says,¬†‚ÄúAnd you did not recite before it any scripture, nor did you inscribe one with your right hand. Otherwise, the falsifiers would have had \[cause for\] doubt.‚Äù (29:48) It was an utter enigma, one that ultimately forced the Prophet‚Äôs Ô∑∫ detractors to settle on the accusation of him being a magician (74:24), unwittingly conceding that there was something, in fact, supernatural about this Book.

## 2.¬†A historical wonder

Despite engaging the questions of its first audience,¬†which infinitely compounds the required on-hand expertise, the Qur‚Äôan is remarkably¬†accurate about lost history. It should be noted that, in contrast to the Bible, no discrepancy exists between the oral¬†transmission of the Qur‚Äôan and its earliest manuscripts.¬†This decentralized dissemination of the Qur‚Äôan made it impossible for anyone to later modify its content, unlike the ‚Äúauthorized revisions‚Äù of¬†the Bible that continue being issued until the present day. The following are some examples of the perplexing historical precision regarding ancient Egypt found in the Qur‚Äôan:

While the Bible also states that the Pharaoh of Moses drowned, the Qur‚Äôan asserts that God will make an example of him for later oppressors by saving his corpse‚Äîon that same day‚Äîfrom being lost at sea. Allah says,¬†‚ÄúAnd We took the Israelites across the sea, and Pharaoh and his soldiers pursued them in tyranny and enmity until, when drowning overtook him, he said, ‚ÄòI believe that there is no deity except that in whom the Israelites believe, and I am of the Muslims.‚Äô Now? And you had disobeyed \[Him\] before and were of the corrupters? So today, We will save you in \[terms of\] your body that you may be to those after you a sign. And indeed, many among humanity are heedless to Our signs‚Äù¬†(10:90-92).

3.¬†Preserved as promised

The preservation and incorruptibility of the Qur‚Äôan was boldly promised therein;¬†‚ÄúIndeed, it is We who sent down the Qur‚Äôan and indeed, We will be its Guardian‚Äù¬†(15:9). One marvels at how a book primarily committed to memory and documented on disjointed bones and leathers over the span of 23 years, could survive‚Äîlet alone without incongruity. People would learn some Qur‚Äôan from the Prophet Ô∑∫ or his Companions, then travel back to their homelands and autonomously teach it to their family, friends, and students, who would then relay it onwards to others.¬†These separate oral transmissions continued independently for centuries, all across the earth, and somehow all 1.8 billion Muslims today still recite the Qur‚Äôan exactly as it was taught to the Prophet‚Äôs Companions and written in the original Uthmanic codex (the Islamic tradition has also documented a wealth of information on pre-Uthmanic¬†variants readings.)

## 4. An extraordinary potency

Sophistication, accuracy, and preservation aside, simply hearing the Qur‚Äôan continues to have a¬†unique and extraordinary effect on people.¬†As al-Kha·π≠·π≠ƒÅbƒ´ (d. 998 AH) writes in¬†*BayƒÅn I øjƒÅz al-Qur æƒÅn*,

>**The inimitability of the Qur‚Äôan has yet another dimension, one which people tend to overlook, and is unrecognized except by a sparse few individuals‚Äînamely what it generates in the hearts and impresses onto the souls. Aside from the Qur‚Äôan, you do not hear of any discourse, neither poetry nor prose, that upon reaching one‚Äôs ears provides such immediate pleasure and sweetness, and at other times such awe and intimidation, like \[the Qur‚Äôan\] does.**

3855,2020-06-23 02:20:35,he316k,"A better study would be to determine which book is right since close to two billion on each side believe their holy book is genuine. Only one has to be true. So which is it?

Let's start our research with an illustration. Suppose someone handed you a $20 bill, how would you know if it is real or fake? Would you study an endless array of counterfeit bills? ""No! That's a huge waste of my time, and it's not very practical."" Indeed. Instead, it would be better to study a real $20 bill; then, it is easier to spot a phony. Similarly, you and I can use the Bible to draw necessary conclusions and determine what is genuine from the Bible and the Qur'an and, by extension, Islamic and Christendom's beliefs (what you might discover about Christendom's belief may surprise you). I say the Bible because it was written long before the Qur'an and is the authority between the two books.

Let's start with Genesis 11:1-9. The Bible and the Qur'an both have a similar summary. Before the great flood, people spoke one language. God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them: ""Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth."" (Genesis 9:1) Unfortunately, one of Noah's great-grandsons, Nimrod, defied God. Instead, he wanted to control people. He gathered many individuals to live in a great city with him as the first politician. He said, ""Come! Let us build a city for ourselves and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a celebrated name for ourselves so that we will not be scattered over the entire face of the earth."" (Genesis 11:4) This proclamation went against God's explicit instructions to spread out, procreate, and fill the earth.

When Nimrod died, his followers continued to defy God's command and went as far as transforming Nimrod into a God and the guardian god of their city of Babylon. (Genesis 10:9). Eventually, the people deified Nimrod and his wife and mother, Semiramis. Their scheme of building their large tower project ended when God confused their language and forced them to disperse. (Genesis 11:7) When they scattered over the earth, they took their Nimrod religion with them. This action established the blueprint for early proto-beliefs. So what aspects of the Nimrod religion spread all over the earth?

&#x200B;

1. **Demon and spirit worship** \- From Nimrod's wicked city of Babylon, demon worship in all its forms ‚Äï magic, fortune-telling, prediction, spells, king-worship, image worship, sex worship, animal worship, and so forth ‚Äï spread to the ends of the earth.
2. **Triad of gods; polytheism** \- The gods of Nimrod began to mutate into triads of gods or polytheistic deities. According to the ancient Greek historian Ctesias, three statues capped a Babylonian temple erected to the god Belus: Bel (or Bel-Merodach), his mother Rhea (Semiramis), and Bel-Merodach's wife, Juno or Beltis (Zer-pan√Ætu).
3. **Immortality of the human soul** \- The Nimrodians believed Nimrod was still alive; thus, the Babylonian religion believed the human soul is immortal. In many ways, the original author of this lie was Satan when he talked to Eve.
4. **Hell or hellfire as an eternal place to punish the damned for sins they committed in life** \- The Babylonian religion believed in the form of hellfire where Nergal was the god of the underworld, and his wife Eresh-kigal was the sovereign lady thereof. On page 373 of *The International Standard Bible Encyclopaedia*, Volume 1, it states: ""After death, the souls of men were supposed to continue in existence. It can hardly be called life. The place to which they have gone referred to as the 'land of no return.' There they lived in dark rooms amid the dust and the bats covered with a garment of feathers and under the dominion of Nergal and Eresh-kigal.""
5. **Mother-child worship** \- Nimrod became a god, and Nimrod's mother Semiramis became the mother of God, and thus mother-child worship was born. ( Examples of Mother-child worship including Virgin Mary and Baby Jesus: [https://i.imgur.com/TF94inV.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/TF94inV.jpg) )"

Notice what I said:

>Somehow, these later texts actually contain the most accurate information compared to the earlier canonical Gospels and works like the Didache

The Didache is not canonical either, yet I cited it here. Why? Because our concern is earliness and many scholars date it very early. 

When I say ""works like the Didache"" I mean early extracanonical works. 

The reason we keep citing the canonical Gospels is that they are dated by critical scholars as very early, especially in comparison to some of the documents I list above. 

This criticism was already accounted for, all you needed to do was to read my post carefully and know that the Didache was not canonical. 

>The actual evidence shows none of them(Bible and apocryphal books) is reliable 

I already said: 

>To give you some context: secular scholars generally date the canonical Gospels and undisputed letters of Paul within 20-70 years of Jesus life. Yet most things about Jesus' life are in doubt or debated.

The actual issue is simple: these books are earlier than the sources of the Qur'an, yet are not fully trusted by secular authors. So why would we trust even later works? 

Attacking the New Testament won't save you. The problem you're gonna run into is that the very scholarly skepticism I cite against the canonical books of the NT *damns* the apocryphal texts cited above even more by the same logic. And if we can't trust works from the 2^(nd) century on then it's even more laughable to trust a work 6 centuries on.

>The business card sized and oldest piece of the Bible, P1

It's not the oldest piece of the Bible. There are fragmentary texts from Qumran (containing things like Genesis -where the story of Adam is told) that predate that. 

The problem you're running into here is one of massive special pleading. 

The problem isn't that we *can't* trace the stories in the Qur'an. The problem is that tracing the stories leads us to texts that are even later than our canonical books. The problem is that you're committed to two things: first you must downgrade our earliest gospels while simultaneously claiming that even later books are the ones that contain the historical kernels about Jesus.

There are skeptical critical historians. But if anyone is inclined to doubt early texts, they would not then commit themselves to finding the real historical details in texts that range anywhere from a century to half a millennia later. 

The only reason this is being done is that the Qur'an copies those stories, and Muslims have a theological need to defend it.

Otherwise, if I saw a story that wasn't in books in the 1st century, but showed up in the 5th century, then a book in the 7th century copy it I would simply say that it's what it seemed like: later inventions being copied by later books.

Beyond that, there's also the issue that certain tales look like the clear product of artifice. Is it a coincidence that the Protevangelium seems to make Mary's birth *very* similar to Samuel's? If you're going to be skeptical of the NT then you should be skeptical of the Protevangelium and  your answer is ""no"""

In history we prefer earlier texts to later ones for obvious reasons. You are telling me that I should trust the book written in the 5th century more than the one written in the 2nd century. Why? Because the Qur'an quotes the former. This just seems like theistic bias.

We already talked about this in the Historical Background section.

1. The entire early history of Islam/Mohammed is a matter of huge debate. Our earliest biography comes around a century later and is itself edited to remove unflattering things.
2. I repeat again: Christianity was everywhere. Even Islamic sources mention this. It was in the south in Najran, it was to the north, it was to the east. The idea that none of these things spread is convenient but we're skeptical
3. Even Islamic sources claim that Mohammed was a trader. 
4. *You're missing the basic point of the post*: The Qur'an does share some stories with the Bible, but it often shares stories that are much later, are legendary and are not in the OT or NT. The story of Satan not kneeling because he is fire and Adam is dirt is not in the OT, it is a later story. Mary and the palm tree is not in a canonical book, it is a later story. This would not be a surprise if the author was using the stories he found around him. 

>The Old testament is was not translated and the New testament that was in geek was translated years later

Seriously, now I'm wondering if you read my post. This is simply false. The New Testament was translated from Greek into other languages long before Islam's time.

It's pretty telling; Muslims *think* their Qur'an is paralleling the Bible, which is okay by them. It's really just paralleling stories in the region, many of them from centuries upon centuries later.

3866,2020-06-23 02:21:03,he316k,"We are now at a crossroads. We need to discern whether the Qur'an teaches any of the above to determine its purity.

**1. Demon and spirit worship** \- Jinns or genies are supernatural creatures in Arab folklore and Islamic teachings (Surah 15:27; 55:74; Surah 72; hundreds of references in total) that occupy a parallel world to that of humanity. Jinns, humans, and angels all make up the three sentient creations of Allah. Religious sources say little about Jinns; however, the Qur'an mentions that Jinns exist of ""smokeless flame"" (Surah 15:27; 55:15, 35). Similar to humans, Jinns can be useful, evil, or neutrally benevolent.

**2. Triad of gods; polytheism** \- On page 18-19 of the book *Muhammad: The Holy Prophet - Hafiz Ghulam Sarwar,* it reads, ""About four hundred years before the birth of Muhammad one Amr bin Lahyo ... a descendant of Qahtan and king of Hijaz had put an idol called Hubal on the roof of the Kaba. This Hubal idol was one of the chief deities of the Quraish before Islam."" Why is this significant? This Hubal was a moon god.

In Mecca, there was a god named Hubal, who was Lord of the Kabah. This moon god referred to as ""al-ilah,"" is not a proper name of a single specific god but a generic reference meaning ""the god."" Each Arabic tribe would refer to their local tribal god or gods as ""al-ilah."" Eventually, ""al-ilah"" was later shortened to Allah before Muhammad began promoting his new religion in 610 AD. When Muhammad came along, he dropped all references to the name ""Hubal"" but retained the generic ""Allah."" In substance what he said to the people was ""Since you worship all these gods and feel Hubal is the greatest of the gods, my religion just ignores all other gods and only recognizes Hubal as 'Allah.'"" Thus Islam transformed from a polytheistic religion into a monotheistic one.

It is worth noting that many non-Arabic pagans worshiped the sun. Romans, for example, called the sun ""Sol Invictus,"" which means ""Invincible Sun."" In contrast, Arabic pagans worshiped the Moon, and nowhere is this more present than in the crescent moon, the most common symbology of this pagan moon worship that dates back to 2000 BC. The crescent moon is the most prominent symbol in Arabic society today, to the degree that it adorns many flags of Arabic nations.

**3. Immortality of the human soul** \- Islam teaches that man has a soul that goes on to the Hereafter. The Qur'an states, ""It is Allah Who takes away the souls at the time of their death, and those that die not during their sleep. He keeps those (souls) for which He has ordained death and sends the rest for a term appointed. Verily, in this are signs for a people who think deeply."" (Surah 39:42) At the same time, Surah 75 speaks of ""Al-Qiyamah, or The Resurrection,"" or ""The Rising of the Dead"" (MMP). In part, it says: ""I swear by the Day of Resurrection ... Does man (a disbeliever) think that We shall not assemble his bones? ... He asks: ""When will be this Day of Resurrection?""... Is not He (Allah Who does that) Able to give life to the dead? (Yes! He can do all things)."" ‚Äï Surah 75:1, 3, 6, 40.

**4. Hell or hellfire as an eternal place to punish the damned for sins they committed in life** \- According to the Qur'an, the soul can have different destinies, which can be a heavenly garden of paradise or the punishment of a burning hell. As the Qur'an states: ""They ask: ""When will be the Day of Recompense?"" (It will be) a Day when they will be tried (punished, i.e., burnt) over the Fire! ""Taste you your trial (punishment, i.e., burning)! This is what you used to ask to be hastened!"" (Surah 51:12-14) ""For them is a torment in the life of this world, and certainly, harder is the torment of the Hereafter. And they have no Waq (defender or protector) against Allah."" (Surah 13:34) This question is asked: ""And what will make you know what it is? (It is) a fiercely blazing Fire!"" (Surah 101:10, 11) This dire fate described in detail: ""Surely! Those who disbelieved in Our Ayat (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), We shall burn them in Fire. As often as their skins are roasted through, We shall change them for other skins that they may taste the punishment. Truly, Allah is Ever Most Powerful, All-Wise."" (Surah 4:56) A further description states: ""Truly, Hell is a place of ambush - They will abide therein for ages. Nothing cool shall they taste therein, nor any drink except boiling water, and dirty wound discharges -"" (Surah 78:21, 23-25).

Muslims believe that a dead person's soul goes to al-Barzakh, or ""Purgatory,"" and is the place or state in which people will be after death and before Judgment."" (Surah 23:99, 100, AYA, footnote) Their soul is conscious while they experience something termed the chastisement or torment of the Hereafter. (Surah 13:34) This event awaits the person, had they been wicked, or happiness had they had been faithful. However, even faithful ones must also experience some torment because of the few sins they committed while alive. On the judgment day, each faces his eternal destiny, which ends his or her intermediate state in al-Barzakh."

Why would this be a problem? It's expected that there would be stories similar to the Quran in books that came before it. This would only be an issue if one believed the Gospel mentioned in the Quran is the Bible today, perhaps you are assuming that.

I get the impression that's the case as you said this:

> There are skeptical critical historians. But if anyone is inclined to doubt early texts, they would not then commit themselves to finding the real historical details in texts that range anywhere from a century to half a millennia later.

That's a cop out that separates the supernatural claims from the historical. Both books are claiming divine origins and supernatural events regardless of history within. It's acting as if we should accept questionable information from questionable a source just because it was earlier then use that as a basis to say the later was copied when to the divine later and earlier mentions can be the same source. Consider the possibility that they are originally divine and that the claim it's from the same source also fits the spread of stories in the past, why wasn't that number 4. in ""synthesizing this information""."

TBH if that was what they actually thought then it wouldn't even be worth debating. The stories in Quran are found in books before it...the Quran makes it clear this is expected since it's claiming it's sent other scripture and it's been corrupted, so it's not an issue if that's all that's being claimed. 

The difference here is that u/Tsegen taking it further than the title or initial argument and is relying on the claim that the Bible is the Gospel the Quran refers to. Basically if the Quran is saying the Bible is this or that then there is a mismatch between it's claims and the Bible, but if the Quran is saying the Bible is not the Gospel then there is expected to be a mismatch to the Bible as what it's actually referring to is the uncorrupted revelation to Jesus. Christians claim the Quran is talking about their Bible and Muslims claim it isn't.

Pay close attention to the actual claim here: If this is true, if any Arab were copying, they wouldn‚Äôt have any complete book to crosscheck by, they would have passed-on tales.

You don't know where did Muhammad SCW travel, when,how many times, how long did he stay,who dod he meet and this can be actually found in Islamic sources wich bring clarity to why a claim against Muhammad SCW beinga copying, lying individual is absurd and it can be dismissed. 

Literally in the Old testament its clear that there is a Prophesy of a Prophet coming from Arabia to the people of Kedar (son of Ismail) near mount Sela wich happens to be in Medina. So yeah, Muhammad SCW is the only one fitting in this description and the monk was speaking the Truth. Seriously,  your ignorance is absolutely clear.

So, my argument or the islamic argument actually sti√∂l stands. You can bring anything you want but you will have to address issues it creates and the Quran's linguistics itself.

You are telling me that I should trust the book written in the 5th century more than the one written in the 2nd century. Why? Because the Qur'an quotes the former. This just seems like theistic bias.""

The Quran is from the 6th century, not the 5th.

The reasons why we need to believe in the Quran over the bible in SOME areas (The bible says things that are nor in the bible ans vise versa)  are because the Quran is more reliable.

 The Quran is spoken by a man who claims direct Prophethood, the bible is spoken by historically unknown men that tell stories about someone else without being eye witnesses to the events and the men don't even make the same claims (Mark,Matthew,John,Luke,all the non canonical text....etc..all the thousands of variants...etc) and the Qifan has one version, one story word for word. No X amount of variants (Qira'at and Ahrfu are in recitation and pronounciation and it still has the same excat content word for word). 

The Quran can be tracked back to the one that spoke itz the oldest Old testament manuscripts is dated to be atleadt 1100 years after Moses. The New testament is dated decades after Jesus. They both don't havw any oral transmissions that could show us a chain of narrations that can be tracked back to these Prophets,The Quran is orally transmitted to begin with so we have these chains. 

So, this is just the objective preservation part only. Now the inconsistency part is another but i think my reasons are clear,this is why i  don't take the bible as reliable source of information.

You can talk about all you want but it doesn't make my claims invalid.

1. You and few scholars have theories to suggest the islamic history might be different but the consensus disagrees so its not a huge debate, its one sided and if the muslim scholars are counted in, the consesnus is definelty against the objections to islamic history.  So this doesn't really make any difference for you to mention this as a response.


2. Yeah,i never denied that the christians where ""everywhere"" but we know the history of Muhammad SCW and from there we can conclude that he did not memorize their non arabic sripture, translate them and recite them back im a period of 23 years circumstantionally in a way that its such a complex linguistics that made the arabs call him and his words ""magic"" that can't be mimiced by modern linguistics teams with their hundreads of attempts. Its safe to rule this one out.

Also, i clearly spoke about the bibles, where is your respond in this? There were no existing new testament manuscripts in arabic at that time at all. 




3. Uuhm,yes. What do you mean ""even""? You are speaking as if i denied it.

From the life of Muhammad SCW we know about his trips outside Arabia and outside Mecca and the common trade areas wich do conclude what i mentioned. This arguments is invalid when we ask ""Where did Muhammad SCW go,how long was he there,how often did he visit that place?) and everything stops there. 

Its funny how people resort to trying to invalidate  that a illiterate man can even speak words that transfrom hearts and a whole land. All of this unsuccesfully.

4. Ok, this is the most irrelevant part and i thank you for your views.


Strawman fallacy, i said that the New testament was not translated in Arabic in the 7th century. It did use the word "" Greek"" but i did not claim that it was not in any other language, its simply wasn't in arabic. Its irrelevant if it was in other language or not."
3874,2020-06-23 17:19:38,he316k,"> You're not the only one to make this mistake, almost as if you didn't read the post: these stories aren't from the Bible, some of them are from centuries after the Bible was codified.

Why a story takes place in God's Book?. Such as no records around about how Mary get appointed to Temple of Jerusalem and how he got sponsored for her education.

Simply God links His revelation with events and wisdom for His subjects. What is not found in Bible and Torah is still in memorised portions of Church and Jewish literature such as the prayer of Jesus for breaking the bread at the last supper. 

God had repeated this prayer in Quran and these notes got repeated over and over again.

Or famously, the Fatehah being the executive summary of Quran can be found scattered in Torah. Famously ""Barouch Adonai"" is still a prayer for breaking bread.

And nobody can come up with those two words then pin to the meaning of our lives as God decreed so.

Read backwards, it might be wisdom of a Prophet and God repeated it at another revelation. Sunnah in this example is a display of wisdom from God, but still we can find it for our use in the form of folklore study.

> It's pretty telling; Muslims think their Qur'an is paralleling the Bible. It's really just paralleling stories in the region, many of them from centuries upon centuries later.

God takes the stories or questions to His Prophets and gives them the answer. For example, Jesus had been asked about a woman who had been claimed of committing prostitution.

Jesus, as he knew the punishment but didn't have the authority to exert the punishment, told them how to act. Then as the claimants left the scene, he could only say, ""be on God's path"" to anybody.

The story is not God's verse or revelation but represents the God's wisdom, yet God reveres the whole of Gospel, and He creates notes in Quran for cross reading.

TL:DR; Data, information, knowledge and wisdom are the steps for human mind for information theory. Verses or stories can only be data, once we gather them in text to form continuity forms surah or chapters and have meanings. Once we cross read these surahs and chapters we build the information or form the Quran, the tuft. And the wisdom is when you use these tufts of information for any given situation in life.

> We have so few Muslims here, it's unfortunate that one of the more prolific inevitably descends into preaching at you after they've done the most cursory (often elliptical) response. You can almost set your watch to it.

If we continue from DIKW, of information theory, apparently they weren't able to pass to information level. Gospels and Torah if we are able to read in their original, such as from word word by translations, matches verbatim with Quran.

What you are pointing here is, if we don't have a thing in writing why God uses it. Because, that thing is about His wisdom.

I don't want to promote certain sects, but all belief systems have a bad strain of sect/side for overruling God's wisdom. If you can break the links of information you can bring the filling material.

And then you can have messiah, hellhounds and ever famously the intercession. Once you start reading God's revelations one can understand how a polyhteist belief system is actually a monotheist but people couldn't stop themselves to chirp in.

> Take it away Thomas Paine:

Almighty says in Quran, Neesa 4:150.

Indeed those who deny God and His messengers, and wishing to distance between God and His messengers, when saying ""we believe in some, and we deny some"", wishing to take a path inbetween...

The ultimate definition and enemy of mankind is as per Neesa 4:151,

These are the exact suppressors of belief. We have prepared a shameful/oppressing punishment.

This verse with other explanations refers a group of people named hypoctires. Jesus has displayed beautiful wisdom in Gospel about them.

As word, the rasoul points to the message carried by the messenger. So, all God's Books, Prophets, Angels are God's rasouls. Angels delivered the code as God decreed onto a human, and the human appointed for that job had used his existence to showcase the message.

If that person had committed a mistake God had corrected that person when he is alive, and also gave guidance.

What we are talking here is essentially, how come words turn into action? Machines cannot do that, animals can only follow instructions such as looking and hearing and using their logic. Humans can do and more by seeing, listening and believing, God gave one extra ability to humans over all earthlings, humans can overrule their logic."

3879,2020-06-23 02:21:19,he316k,"So based on the above, the following is mentioned or taught in the Qur'an.

1. Demon and spirit worship
2. Triad of gods; polytheism
3. Immortality of the human soul
4. Hell or hellfire as an eternal place to punish the damned for sins they committed in life
5. I'm sure if I spent more time, I could find an example of mother-child worship, but as it is, the four above are more than enough.

Now ask yourself, if Islam were a $20 bill, what authenticity would you give it based on its above doctrines when compared with the ancient Nimrod religion?

My studies show me that most religions originate from ancient Babylon and the religion of Nimrod because they all share slight variations of common doctrines. The doctrines themselves act as clues to help me identify which ones are false, and which ONE is real.

Jesus said, ""Go in through the narrow gate, because broad is the gate and spacious is the road leading off into destruction, and many are going in through it; whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are finding it."" (Matthew 7:13,14) Utilizing an illustration, Jesus said there would only be one true religion.

Now let's compare two aspects of the religion of Nimrod: ""the immortality of the human soul"" and ""a hellfire that damns people for sins they committed in life."" Christendom and Islam's core doctrines both share doctrines and are nearly indistinguishable. In a total contrast to both, Jehovah God makes the condition of the dead very clear from his Word the Bible.

* (Ecclesiastes 9:5) For the living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all.
* (Psalm 115:17) The dead do not praise Jah; Nor do any who go down into the silence of death.
* (Psalm 146:4) His spirit goes out, he returns to the ground; On that very day, his thoughts perish.

The evidence concludes that death is the exact opposite of life. After you die, there is oblivion. It is as if you are in a deep sleep, like what anesthesia does to you before surgery. You feel no pain and are subjected to no torment for any misdeeds in life. Death is the painless penalty Adam and Eve suffered for their willful disobedience. Death is also the eventuality for Satan and his demonic followers (Revelation 20:10). Jehovah God would never condemn Adam, Eve, nor Satan and the demons, for their disobedience to a place of eternal torment. 1 John 4:8 tells us, ""God is love,"" so to do something like that would not be just nor loving. However, it would also not be just or loving to let humans continue to die for Adam's sin forever.

Further, the Bible shows that Adam only fathered children after sinning (Genesis 3:23; 4:1, 2, 25), which means sin is a genetic defect passed on to all Adam's children, and eventually, every human who has ever lived (except Jesus). (Romans 5:12; 1 Peter 2:22) Humans are imperfect and born with sin. Because we are under sin's rule, we cannot serve God perfectly. Thus death is the penalty. (Romans 5:12) That's why Jesus' death is so important. It equalizes Adam's sin. In effect, Jesus tasted ""death for everyone"" so that through his ransom sacrifice, we have the hope of living forever on a paradise earth. (Hebrews 2:9) Living under paradisiac conditions is what we would have today had Adam been obedient in Eden.

This is just one truth. If this sounds entirely new to you or radically different from anything taught in Islam or Christendom, it is because most religions originate from the pagan Nimrod religion. Only Jehovah's Witnesses appear to teach these truths because only with God's help have they been able to discern them from the Bible."

The Cave of Treasures and The Life of Adam and Eve are  not Scripture unless you want to save the Qur'an from having copied apocrypha and fantasy. 

We have witnesses to Genesis going back to Qumran. We have manuscripts [after that](https://larryhurtado.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/christian-lit-texts-2nd3rd-cents1.pdf) but before the witnesses to these two texts. 

The Torah is generally held to have been compiled during the Babylonian Exile (6th century BCE). But a few revisionists back Persian-period compilation. Life of Adam and Eve has witnesses from the 4th century CE, and may be earlier. Cave of Treasures is from 4th to 6th century CE.

According to you the most reasonable explanation was that the sections in Life of Adam and Eve and Cave of Treasures were originally in the Torah, then they were removed from every Torah we have -even those of isolated groups like those at Qumran- but survived for more than 500 years (if we take the high end estimates it's closer to 900), showed up in an apocryphal document and then promptly disappeared again.

Does anyone who doesn't already believe the Qur'an is right believe this? 

> but if the Quran is saying the Bible is not the Gospel then there is expected to be a mismatch to the Bible as what it's actually referring to is the uncorrupted revelation to Jesus

That's not an escape either.

Muslims have been trained to see the ""we mean the uncorrupted revelation!"" defense as a safe harbor because it seems unfalsifiable; that book is lost so there is nothing to compare. (A sad state of affairs when the only defense you can offer is that you cannot be conclusively proven wrong). BTW: the [Qur'an's message of corruption is far more complex than what Muslims believe](https://old.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/gvpi98/collecting_all_relevant_verses_shows_that_the/)

But it doesn't help in this situation because what I'm saying is that there's no reason to posit some magical hypothetical perfect Injeel, when we can just posit that the author of the Qur'an was a relentless copier of texts. There's no reason to posit any omniscient being. This is a *negative* argument. We don't need to have the magical hypothetical uncorrupted Gospel (Especially since only Muslims talk about this book) to make this argument. We can ask which makes more sense. 

How do we know? Because we have those texts, we know how they could have reached Arabia and no historian would appeal to them today. Yet the Qur'an doesn't know better. 

>The counter evidence to the Quran's claim is the same thing anyway, a mismatch with the current Bible it claims is corrupted. That's what one would expect if the Quran's claim was true

This is obviously just bad logic. The mere fact that the Qur'an deviates from the Bible doesn't validate the Qur'an's absurdly lofty claims of divine origin or ""correcting"" the Bible, all it proves is that the Qur'an deviates.

Consider this example: 

The Qur'an copied a well known sexual satire invented by a Greek Christian and thus it deviates from the Bible. What evidence would this provide that the Qur'an is true? None, it provides the opposite because it deviates in a way that anyone who knows better -certainly if they're omniscient- should not allow. 

That's the problem: the deviation matches later legends we have no reason (beyond Muslim wishful thinking) to consider more reliable."

>The reasons why we need to believe in the Quran over the bible in SOME areas (The bible says things that are nor in the bible ans vise versa) are because the Quran is more reliable.

Why do you keep talking about the Bible? These books are not in the Bible. Things would be so much better for Muslims if they were. But they aren't. 

In fact, if Muslims are sometimes contemptuous of the Bible as a ""corrupted book"" (as you show here) you should be doubly contemptuous of even later books. And I'm almost certain you would be if there wasn't the embarrassing fact that the stories in these books match the Qur'an. Your entire polemic against the Bible *eats itself*, because it's revealed to be hollow if you don't apply that same polemic to later works.

In the Quran's narrative you wouldn't expect knowledge beyond those accessible to Muhammad as it's claiming previous scripture is from the same source originally so the source of knowledge. If that source is telling the truth then it can't exactly just make up details that didn't happen.

I already told you my position regarding the Quran and if you go back and read it, you will see how irrelevant your question is. What ever the Quran contains, we beleive in it, the actual question you can logically ask is to why is the Quran a reliable source of information? Thats really it. My response was directly to your false claim, historians don't care whats older if its inconsistent and if it has thousands of variants. When the Quran spesifically mentions ONE single version of these events and claims it to be the truth, the uncorrupted word of God, then we need to question that. Remember and i told you this already, we consider the Quran to be the Word of God and we believe the previosus scriptures where the Word of God as well untill they got corrupted and the corruption is observable and clear. So your question really has no value and shows that you did not read or comprehend what i said.


You said ""Yet Muslims are telling us that we should believe that that Gospel was closer to the truth despite being half a millennium later."", please explain further.

Sorry but the fact that you tgot offended by me ""educating"" you shows you did not listen, your earleir question shows that. 

""I wasn't actually speaking of the Qur'an, I was speaking of the apocryphal books above; some have Syriac witnesses in the 5th century, as noted."" - Alrighty then, my bad.

""Why do you keep talking about the Bible? These books are not in the Bible. Things would be so much better for Muslims if they were. But they aren't.""- I call it the bible because they are generally called ""gospels"" even tho they are not canon. Anyways, its should be very clear to you that the bible and the non canocial text are irrelevant to us you claim that we WISH they were in the bibel assumes that we even consider the canonical bibles as more reliable as the non canonical text, its just one peace of text to us that has fragments of the words of God form the Injeel. Please, don't make this mistake ever again.

Christian scholars have given us and the whole world valuable information of editing, corruption and unreliablity in the Old and in the New testament. Im not going to debate with you about a subject that is common knowledge you simply are ignorant about, please go do your research.

I don't have to apply the polemics to the later ""works"", this is why it told you to listen up, i knew you were going to ignore what i write you. Now listen carefully: The claims Islam makes is that the previous scriptures came from God to his Prophets, the people alter on corrupted them ( observable, agreed upon acdemically) and God had to send another relevation and the laast revelation is the Quran. 

I don't need to apply the same polemics to the Quran becasue of these premises, on TOP of that, we have complete preservation of the Qurabn and the later text are not preserved at all and this is what the Quran itself claims and the claimsa are still absolutely true. 

So in short, don't need to go to anywhere, i just need to argue for the Quran and its claims of its divinity and thats it.

If we're talking about history then you might have heard the issues with Moses and Mosaic authorship over the last two centuries or so. Mosaic authorship is no longer any sort of major position. Moses may or may not have lived but is also questionable as a historical figure.

You can explain anything. Some explanations are thinner, more speculative and circuitous than others . One can just claim that as a matter of theology they just believe something  but consider what I would be required to believe as a matter of history: a text that I have no proof existed during the compilation of Genesis, is not in any of our manuscripts of Genesis (hell, no proof it existed until many centuries later) was originally removed from Genesis and then somehow showed up again centuries later outside of Genesis and then left again.

And my point is that, since deviation doesn't mean validation of Qur'anic claims in and of themselves, certain deviations can be said to be worse for Qur'anic claims compared to others. 

>That's what I still don't get about the original claim, as if Muslims believe the Quran is divine because it has details about Jesus. Never even heard anyone claim such a thing.

The Qur'an claims it:

The events were ""unseen"" and the author of the Qur'an or the listeners  could not have known them since they were not there. Hence why God needed to get involved.

You do realize you are pulling from Western scholarship on Islam? Do you need another reason as to why? That's a whole other can of worms honestly, but western academics has had several problematic theories surrounding Islam, Reynolds included, that were later found to be false. For the last 120 years of it's research of Islam the claim was that the Quran wasn't written down for some 200 years, it was only until manuscripts were brought forth and discovered did western academia quietly change its stance and basically move on to quiet agreement with the Islamic narrative. So if you need reasons to take what is said with a grain of salt they are there.

History isn't some kind of complete source. We have bits and pieces to build the narrative and if you are a secular scholar then you go off of what you have and by default can't accept anything divine into the narrative. So of course they have to take it as it is as they don't know if what they have is the earliest copy, a reliable copy of the original, or when it went from oral to written so there is going to be gaps and holes. Furthermore, all the splitting and debate going on with the strife it causes should be taken into account.

Genesis is a record of oral tradition. We can't verify it as original. So you have several plausible explanations here as to why Cave of Treasures or any other parts/bits would have such details yet isn't in the manuscripts we have of Genesis. Many of them have a small bit in it that's similar, as if the general notion survived, but the details were lost/changed.

> certain deviations can be said to be worse for Qur'anic claims compared to others.

How is it worse? 

Direct copying can't be claimed and the way they are written is unlike the Quran. If anything the claims make Muhammad pbuh out to be a master of several languages and scripture conveniently picking the most consistent details yet at the same time the Quran claims he was unlettered thus revealing to all at the time that he wasn't? Something his enemies couldn't pin on him either? It would have been easy to see that Muhammad was making up the Quran by anyone then if that information was so widespread and available. It's more plausible that he actually didn't collect and memorize several large books from Christians that deemed them unauthentic by then, learn a language few knew just to access writings that likely only missionaries and priests had, accessed the Torah in another language, and then bring together a consistent narrative as if he was a literary genius.

Where did you get your interpretation of that verse from?

Previous verses are going over events leading up to Jesus' birth, which is not even covered in the OP. The overall point being made is that Jesus' birth isn't reason to claim Son of God. ""It is not for God to take a son unto Him. Glory be to Him! When He decrees a thing, He but says to it 'Be,' and it is."" 19:35

Lastly, note the part with Mary giving birth, the part you questioned in Pseudo-Matthew about journeying after birth isn't found in the Quran. The Quran speaks about it from a different perspective as well, which aligns more with an eyewitness account as it should if someone who was there is relating this and passing it on.

Actually this is starting to become interesting. Several of these kinds of mistakes are made yet the Quran leaves them out, it's quite similar to other claims of copying in that aspect.

More examples:

In the story with the date palm it has Jesus commanding the date palm and taking ownership of the command. Yet the Quran makes it clear, and more consistent, that it's all by the commands of Allah or Allah through his angel, which is Allah's command. It also has the same issue of perspective. Also avoids mentioning dragons. Also note the Quran has no mention of Egypt."

I'm a bit confused by this sentence.

When I say ""historical kernel"" I mean something that points to a certain historical event, even if embellished.

I am not asking if the book as a whole is historical, but whether those stories within the books are historical.

>Do you need another reason as to why? That's a whole other can of worms honestly, but western academics has had several problematic theories surrounding Islam, Reynolds included, that were later found to be false

No, all the scholarship on the dating of the apocryphal Gospels comes from Western scholarship *on Christianity*. As we  know, Western study of the Bible is ancient and Western critical scholarship is centuries old at this point. 

We don't even need to get into Islam here; we are citing the experts on ancient Christianity and Judaism and the apocryphal Gospels on their dating.

My question was why Western critical scholarship *of the apocryphal Gospels* has never suggested anything like the scenario I laid out. You don't need to add Islam to the picture. The question is why they don't believe the apocryphal Gospels are historical or the sort of scenario I laid out. It seems like the only person who would support the scenario I laid out is a Muslim desperate to save the Qur'an from error.

As for ""problems"": traditional Islamic scholarship has its own problems. I am not the one saying it; Yasir Qadhi was the one who went on HD video and said the ""traditional narrative has holes"" and said that Muslims have ""red lines"" that they don't go past while Western scholars do and thus see that ""the emperor has no clothes"".

I didn't say it, Yasir Qadhi said it. 

https://youtu.be/d225z-Yn0vk

(IMO simply refusing to consider certain possibilities as a ""red line"" is a much bigger problem than having wrong theories because it means you may never get the right theory)

>History isn't some kind of complete source. 

It's the best we have. The alternative is fancy and myth and special pleading. The Hindus would believe what they like, the Muslims too, the Christians the same. And then where would we be? 

This is why critical scholarship is so important. 

>Genesis is a record of oral tradition

I wouldn't put it that way. 

>So you have several plausible explanations here as to why Cave of Treasures or any other parts/bits would have such details yet isn't in the manuscripts we have of Genesis. Many of them have a small bit in it that's similar, as if the general notion survived, but the details were lost/changed.

Right. So the more reasonable explanation to you is that our copies of Genesis are all wrong but Cave of Treasures was right on this, despite our copies of Genesis going back centuries before Cave of Treasures? 

Which explanation is more plausible, really? This to me is like saying that the Aeneid, which was partly based off the Iliad, is more historical than the Iliad which predates it by centuries.

Would you agree that that is just as plausible? 

> Where did you get your interpretation of that verse from?

From the plain reading of the verse. It is telling us that God is giving us events that Mohammed couldn't have seen. The rest of your exegesis doesn't challenge this. 

>Lastly, note the part with Mary giving birth, the part you questioned in Pseudo-Matthew about journeying after birth isn't found in the Quran. 

Sure, it's not a *perfect* redaction. Just suspiciously close in other ways. 

I don't expect a perfect redaction though.Matthew and Luke seemed to have Mark's Gospel right in front of them and they still changed things. Why wouldn't the author of the Qur'an? 

>The Quran speaks about it from a different perspective as well, which aligns more with an eyewitness account as it should if someone who was there is relating this and passing it on.

Alternatively: It didn't happen anyway and/or the Qur'an, like many redactionary texts, leaves out things as suits its interests or the mindset of the redactor.

You could create a gospel harmony right now that theoretically made more sense than having four gospels. If you look at the span of history people can produce more concise versions of the stories in the Torah.

For example: the stories of the plagues of Egypt are more streamlined in film than in Genesis.

Does this prove there were plagues of Egypt *or* that the film Prince of Egypt is more historical than Genesis? 

>In the story with the date palm it has Jesus commanding the date palm and taking ownership of the command. Yet the Quran makes it clear, and more consistent, that it's all by the commands of Allah or Allah through his angel, which is Allah's command

As I said, redactors often change works to suit their own interests.

Take for example the baptism of Jesus:

Mark|Matthew|Luke|John
:--|:--|:--|:--
Mark 1:9 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.|Matt 3:13 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. 14 But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? 15 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.|Luke 3:2121a Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying [1],|24 Now they had been sent from the Pharisees. 25 They asked him, ‚ÄúWhy then are you baptizing if you are neither the Messiah,[h] nor Elijah, nor the prophet?‚Äù 26 John answered them, ‚ÄúI baptize with water. Among you stands one whom you do not know, 27 the one who is coming after me; I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandal.‚Äù 28 This took place in Bethany across the Jordan where John was baptizing.29 The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him and declared, ‚ÄúHere is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! 30 This is he of whom I said, ‚ÄòAfter me comes a man who ranks ahead of me because he was before me.‚Äô 31 I myself did not know him; but I came baptizing with water for this reason, that he might be revealed to Israel.‚Äù 32 And John testified, ‚ÄúI saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him. 33 I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‚ÄòHe on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.‚Äô 34 And I myself have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.‚Äù[i]




Notice: in Mark Jesus is just baptized. But in Matthew and John they make sure to correct this and point out that Jesus had to agree or John wasn't worthy of baptizing him.

Why?

Because Christians came to believe that Jesus was God or exalted so it didn't make sense for him to be subordinate to John. The redactors changed the story to suit their theology didn't they?

Now, in this situation you can recognize what is happening because you don't believe Jesus is God so it makes sense to you that he isn't baptized. 

Now imagine that I'm not Muslim and imagine how I see the Qur'an doing the same thing."

Let's be accurate here, Western Christian study of the Bible is ancient and Western secular study is barely a hundred years old with recent movements pushing it to become more secular.

The answer is because there is no one there to suggest otherwise among the secular and Christians and also that's the limitations of history, you work with what you got. Even with recent effort who is noting that Muhammad avoiding taken certain questionable details? It hasn't entered the discourse and there likely isn't any rush to consider something your discipline would reject anyway.

> Right. So the more reasonable explanation to you is that our copies of Genesis are all wrong but Cave of Treasures was right on this, despite our copies of Genesis going back centuries before Cave of Treasures?

You said it yourself that history was the ""best we have"" so why is it implausible? That stuff was likely put on material that wouldn't even last 50 years. As I said, once you take into account all of this and accept what history is then one should be open to that explanation rather than making more out of what we have.

If you had told someone just a hundred years ago of the things we would discover they would be amazed.

As for Iliad and Aeneid, they are poems, not scripture with supernatural claims. It simply isn't going to be so simple. There is no reason to be bias in approaching those claims by leaning on the ""best we have"" default position on those claims, if anything we should be very aware of that as we use it.

> I don't expect a perfect redaction though. Matthew and Luke seemed to have Mark's Gospel right in front of them and they still changed things. Why wouldn't the author of the Qur'an?

How many of the things changed make it far more consistent with what it claims to be? 

Isn't that evidence that pushes one to claim a conflicting narrative that Muhammad was very well read yet convinced people of a book that said says in it he wasn't?

> Alternatively: It didn't happen anyway and/or the Qur'an, like many redactionary texts, leaves out things as suits its interests or the mindset of the redactor.

> You could create a gospel harmony right now that theoretically made more sense than having four gospels.

So now Muhammad had the necessary tools to edit and rewrite all the sources he took from while then compiling them with only the details that made sense? Because one would definitely need money, tools to pull that off, and be a genius to pull that off. The alternative just sends us down the conspiracy route where we have to claim Muhammad was so many friggin amazing things to even consider it plausible.

> Now imagine that I'm not Muslim and imagine how I see the Qur'an doing the same thing.

The same thing? So what part suited the theology when Muhammad apparently claimed himself uneducated/illiterate yet nobody picked up on the obvious conflict there? They watch as an illiterate man pulls off Arabic grammar better than everyone else, does a best of across various scriptures, pulls knowledge from a variety of fields, so he could destroy his interest in claiming himself prophet and the Quran divine...? Sharp enough to pull that all off, but not sharp enough to hide such an obvious issue?

What exactly is Muhammad's interest? The conclusions to such claims seems to repeatedly end up being something conflicting."

Mosaic authorship- something you mentioned- was being questioned 300 years ago. A lot of the study was motivated by a certain sort of Protestantism yes, but the flip side of that was that it was tied to rationalism as well. You can have a school of Christians but their methodology will determine where they stand on the critical/apologetic scale.

Bart Ehrman gives his own take on who counts as a critical scholar or a precursor:
>This was a history of scholarship on the historical Jesus, written to explain the attempts scholars had made since the Enlightenment down to Schweitzer‚Äôs own day to describe what Jesus really said and did given the problem of our Gospel sources.  Starting with Hermann Samuel Reimarus in the 1770s, Schweitzer discusses every single major scholar (and eviscerates a good number of them) who had taken on the task, down to Wrede, who overturned the whole apple-cart.

>**Each and every one of these critical scholars of the 18th to very early 20th century realized that we cannot simply accept the Gospels at face-value as giving a historically accurate depiction of Jesus**; instead, they realized that there are discrepancies, contradictions, historical mistakes, etc. in the Gospels, and that therefore they have to be used critically in order to reconstruct what really happened in Jesus‚Äô life.

>Schweitzer starts with Reimarus because he was the first to take on the task in a posthumous writing.  Reimarus did not publish his book in his own day.  He knew that he would not survive professionally if he did.  He‚Äôd be fired and publicly shamed.   So he kept it all hidden.  Only after his death were his ‚ÄúFragments‚Äù (as they are called) published by the German philosopher G. E. Lessing.  They made an enormous impact.  Most biblical scholars and theologians were outraged.

>Reimarus argued that the Gospel sources covered up the truth about who Jesus really was.  In fact, the reason Jesus was crucified was because he was seen as a political revolutionary by the Romans, one who wanted to start a violent revolt against Roman power.  (Why *else* would you crucify an opponent?  It wasn‚Äôt for telling people that they should love one another, ove their enemies, and obey the government!)  The Romans thought so because that‚Äôs who Jesus really was When he talked about the coming ‚Äúkingdom‚Äù he didn‚Äôt mean a spiritual place in heaven: he meant an actual KINGDOM

>You said it yourself that history was the ""best we have"" so why is it implausible?

Of course it's implausible. Especially in light of the alternate thesis: it's just a later story that was then copied by later sources. 

This would be the explanation you would take for any other story that's not in the Qur'an. In fact, this is the exact explanation you use when it comes to all the ""corrupted"" stories in the Bible and New Testament, despite their antiquity. 

When I say ""history"" I don't mean *any* theory of how things happened. I can claim that aliens killed Caesar or a stone carried by a bird fell on Jesus' head and killed him. This is indistinguishable from fancy.

Obviously, you would not accept it if a Christian said ""well, this is all we have"" to justify very unlikely claims that proved his faith -and only his faith-would you? 

That's called special pleading.
>As for Iliad and Aeneid, they are poems, not scripture with supernatural claims.

Scripture with supernatural claims also copy other texts, also make false claims, also are false and late and fabricated.

You already believe this because you believe the Bible is corrupted.

I apply  skepticism both to the Bible and your book. Just cause a books says something doesn't make it prima facie holy. 

>How many of the things changed make it far more consistent with what it claims to be?

The movie Prince of Egypt is more consistent than the Book of Exodus. Is the director of Prince of Egypt divine? Of course not. He doesn't even need to know Egyptian history. What he did was take some of the stories from the Bible, leave others and then knit what he took into a story. This is condensation. 

Also keep in mind: he wasn't the first to do this. Others had probably done so. So there was a roadmap. 

Moreover: ""consistent' doesn't really mean much when all you mean is that it didn't contain one story...while containing all other sorts of fanciful stuff, including all the other miracle claims and the confusing reference to Mary's parentage. Even if you don't think the Qur'an was wrong it could have been clearer. 

>So now Muhammad had the necessary tools to edit and rewrite all the sources he took from while then compiling them with only the details that made sense? 

I don't grant that it only contains stuff ""that made sense"", obviously. There are entire websites dedicated to pointing out things that don't make sense. Serious scholars have argued that there are things that are problems.

I'm not asking you to agree with them. I'm sure you don't since you're a Muslim. I'm just saying that this cannot be taken for granted.

And your example isn't particularly strong. 

>Because one would definitely need money, tools to pull that off, and be a genius to pull that off. 

How smart do you think the person who wrote the Cave of Treasures were? How smart do you think the various rabbis who came up with new stories based on the Scriptures were? How long do you think it took them? 

Do you seriously think I'm going to leap from ""it's a good redactional effort"" to ""God did it"" when you can't haven't defeated the notion that these texts were spreading in the region? 

It's clearly possible for people to compose good religious texts, especially across years or however long the Qur'an was composed (the Muslim sources say years, but of course the degree to which we can trust them is debatable)

>Sharp enough to pull that all off, but not sharp enough to hide such an obvious issue?

Why didn't the Gospel writers hide it either? Were the authors of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John idiots? They wrote some pretty powerful books. 

Apply the same answer to both cases."

No it's not, the conclusion to that has a ludicrous conclusion painting Muhammad pbuh as some kind of genius when all the evidence from actual eyewitness accounts and claims against him from his enemies say otherwise, so there is a conflict there that won't be resolved by leaning on history, but if we are going to do that then we should be applying the same to what we know of Muhammad.

> This would be the explanation you would take for any other story that's not in the Qur'an. In fact, this is the exact explanation you use when it comes to all the ""corrupted"" stories in the Bible and New Testament, despite their antiquity.

Not really, because I'm not claiming the Gospel is the Bible. These stories and the Bible are not written as to what Christians claim them to be, that doesn't require being a Muslim as it's a conclusion drawn from the conflict between how it's written, between each other, and what the claims are. You say antiquity as if there isn't a massive empty gap where we don't have the vast majority of the Bible for hundreds of years after yet we can confirm debate on simple key issues suggesting, along with other evidence, it was either never what they claimed it to be or was changed/dismissed early on etc etc. Yes they are old, but also we just know they are old, not that they are authentic/traceable back to the source. 

> Obviously, you would not accept it if a Christian said ""well, this is all we have"" to justify very unlikely claims that proved his faith

I'll go one further, I wouldn't accept ""well, this is all we have"" to justify any claim. Hence history doesn't get a pass when using it either as it is operating with that as the reality. It's worth noting that when the Quran was challenged the historical evidence was brought forward, now where is evidence to show the Bible is the original words of Jesus? Well this is all we have definitely isn't going to work here to help us figure that out. 

> Moreover: ""consistent' doesn't really mean much when all you mean is that it didn't contain one story...while containing all other sorts of fanciful stuff, including all the other miracle claims and the confusing reference to Mary's parentage. Even if you don't think the Qur'an was wrong it could have been clearer.

Consistency in claims, if it claims the revelation is from God I should see the after effects of it in it's written structure. It's one of the stark differences between the writing in the Quran and Bible. Eyewitness accounts is another claim that is very questionable considering what it says.

Consistency is a trait one would expect if the claim is true, so when it's found and compared to a historical claim that has an inconsistent conclusion to it's claim then that's evidence that the historical claim is false or at least off in it's accuracy.

> Do you seriously think I'm going to leap from ""it's a good redactional effort"" to ""God did it"" when you can't haven't defeated the notion that these texts were spreading in the region?

No, because I don't think anyone is using the stories of Jesus in the Quran as divine proof even though your OP suggests it's the case. We certainly don't need to take history as a complete record of the past as to assume it's the standard or basis for what we should consider incorrect. This is especially true of claiming it's implausible as if the Bible is well connected to its source rather than having gaping holes.

Also I don't think those texts were spreading in the region as they weren't a literate people. They would have had to have spread orally if at all.

> especially across years or however long the Qur'an was composed (the Muslim sources say years, but of course the degree to which we can trust them is debatable)

Alright I'll bite.

You don't need the Muslim sources to figure this out. You can look at it's structure and see that if it's consistent on several levels or not. The difference between it and other books is that when they are written over a period of time the theology and style changes just as it does with the Bible. There is also a consistency here as the Quran claims to be guidance and Muhammad an example so there is an expectation that it is going to provide that guidance and example for life and like any teaching/nurturing it easies the one being taught into it and shows a multitude of examples. Any human author will reveal those traits in their writing yet since you don't have an explanation as to why the Quran doesn't you then jump to oh it's debatable...who is debating that the Quran was revealed over years? Seriously, source this scholar that is claiming otherwise as I haven't heard it debated at all. 

> Why didn't the Gospel writers hide it either?

They certainly have taken advantage of it. Since the originals can't be traced you just have to take the earliest as being it, but you have a massive gap between scraps and an actual mostly complete manuscript to cross reference. When that is done it reveals that it's been messed with, having entire passages added etc. So instead of looking at some anonymous author we look at the content and the later it is the more certain elements gets forced in, the more borrowing of past gospels, the more stuff is claimed ""mass consensus happening across the world"" with no evidence that one would expect, and the more issues arise. That's not comparable to the Quran at all as we know who wrote it down, can cross reference from manuscripts of people alive during the time, and don't see the kinds of issues like with the Bible with it's authors spread out and conflicting/contradicting each other."

> Lin is likely the better passer

Isn't one of Haliburton's selling points that he's a tremendous passer? Kevin O'Connor at The Ringer calls him a ""genius playmaker"" and says:

> Creative playmaker with extraordinary vision and ambidextrous handles to deliver passes at all angles; he manipulates defenders with his eyes and dribble in the pick-and-roll, and has pinpoint accuracy on passes to rollers and shooters.

Other scouting reports also point to his passing as a major plus. Lin is/was a solid passer, but not exceptional, so seems like a bit of a jump to assume Haliburton wouldn't be as good a passer. You also say that they're both athletic slashers, but I think Lin is much more that mold than Haliburton. Haliburton is an elite catch and shoot 3 guy, which you didn't mention. Meanwhile, one of the knocks on Haliburton isn't that he doesn't have elite burst, nor does he take contact very well when going to the hoop."

I‚Äôd be estatic if anyone in this class reached McCollum‚Äôs production and efficiency.

I won‚Äôt go into all of them, but most of the prospects have serious holes and deficiencies in their games that will keep them from ever breaking NBA rotations, while everyone listed for players are veterans of the league with proven value who don‚Äôt have to change anything to be effective."

CLE: Obi Toppin or Josh Smith - Smith would thrive in today's NBA as a 4 or smallball 5.

MIN: Lamelo Ball or Hedo Turkoglu - Peak Hedo is the player LaMelo hopes to be.

ATL: James Wiseman or Raef LaFrentz - Raef is tempting, but his injury history is too much to ignore. Wiseman.

DET: Killian Hayes or George Hill - Same thing here, Hill is a good player, but injuries. Hayes

NYK: Devin Vassell or Terrence Ross - I like Ross as a sixth man, but I'm going to gamble on Vassell here.

CHA: Onyeka Okongwu or Tristan Thompson - Tristan's a good rebounder, but that's about it. Okongwu

WAS: Deni Ajvida or Shane Battier - this is a tough one, but I'm gonna go Battier. Was never a big scorer, but could defend multiple positions and was one of the better roleplayers in recent memory.

PHX: Issac Okoro or Wilson Chandler - Chandlers the better scorer, but again injuries so gamble on Okoro.

SAS Cole Anthony or Jeff Teague - This is a weird one since Teague could very easily be the player Cole turns into. That said I'll go with Cole and hope he does a better job at helping his team win games than Jeff did.

SAC: Precious Achiwua or Ersan Illyasova - Ersan. Precious might be more athletic, but I have my doubts about his shooting.

3934,2020-06-16 02:35:27,h9n70u,"A few things that I noticed.

Hayes is not that great of an athlete. One of his main weaknesses is his lack of burst. The Lonzo comparison doesn‚Äôt make much sense either. Lonzo is limited by lack of shot creation and finishing ability which are two things Hayes is good at.

Tyrese really isn‚Äôt a guy with a ‚Äúknack‚Äù scoring, otherwise he would be higher on draft boards. He‚Äôs a really good shooter from deep, but struggles to create in the mid range and lacks burst to get to the rim a lot. Lin was never a really good defender either, nor was he super athletic. 

Not to mention Haliburton is praised for his passing ability.

The vassell one was the most confusing. Since when has he been a ridiculous athlete?

Not to mention Ross is known for being a microwave scorer/shot creator off the bench. Vassell is a really good shooter, really good defender who isn‚Äôt great at anything else really and has some shot creation potential."

Raef was definitely ahead of his time, and I agree you take him, but its not really a great comparable.  Maybe Camby?

I also take Edwards over McCollum all day long.  I don't think Edwards is a lock, I just don't think McCollum is particularly special, where Edwards has the possibility of a much higher ceiling."
3936,2020-06-16 03:47:36,h9n70u,"I believe most teams drafting in the top 10 need to go with the upside, even if the median outcome is lower. Thus I think I would be drafting the prospect in all these cases (Warriors perhaps excluded because of their unique situation).

Something that gets missed a lot IMO is it's not actually drafting the bust that hurts you, it's not acquiring the star player. If you mess up your pick at #2 and the guy who goes #3 turns out to be a star, it's better than nothing if your guy turns out to be a solid role player. But good role players can only really make a difference on teams that are already quite good and have star players already. Your future championship outlook would not likely be any different if you drafted a bust at #2 rather than a solid role player.

The benefit IMO of having a draft pick for a bad team is getting the small but non-zero chance you are drafting a stud. A lot of times instead, teams go for higher-floor lower-ceiling options even when they have no stars and just sorta tread water as a result. I can understand why, if you draft a bust you will be ridiculed and maybe even fired. Hinkie got pushed out, and people still bring up the Okafor pick all the time, but that didn't ultimately hurt the franchise nearly as much as passing on Embiid (which was the safe thing to do at the time) would've."

3938,2020-06-16 01:50:34,h9n70u,"I like McCollum, but I do think you're overstating his value a bit. He's good scorer (top 20-25 volume), with just slightly below league average efficiency for each of the last 3 seasons.

Obviously being a 20ppg scorer is a good benchmark, but among those scorers, his efficiency is really not that good. I would argue certainly not good enough to call him ""elite."" Over the past 3 seasons, there have been 80 instances of a player averaging 20ppg. When ranked by True Shooting %, McCollum's 3 seasons rank 76th, 67th, and 70th. 

And he's an okay passer and a meh defender, so the scoring is really what he's got going for him. 

This isn't to shit on McCollum, but to point out that I think you are over-valuing the bird in the hand thing. It would be pretty surprising if nobody in this class reached his production and efficiency.

3942,2020-06-16 04:27:12,h9n70u,"I get your general point, but I think you're underrating McCollum a bit. It's true that his efficiency isn't great, but he's more valuable offensively than his scoring and TS% would suggest. He's *ridiculously* good at hitting the types of shots he takes (over 50% from 10-16 and 16-3pt across the last 2 seasons), which puts unusual strain on defenses. And he almost never turns the ball over. Those factors make him a very good offensive player. Defense is his big issue."

3945,2020-06-16 05:07:15,h9n70u,"Yeah it is pretty hard to double-team CJ in those mid-range areas; he's got enough court vision, and you pretty much don't want to help from one pass away in the NBA with 5 out spacing.

But at the same time when he's cold he just kills you. Teams will give up the lightly contested stepback/pull-up midrange. When CJ isn't hitting, he will keep taking that shot. In general if that shot is open, generally a pocket pass to the rim running big or a skip pass to a wide open corner shooter is also open if you put more pressure on the rim.

So he is quite hard to quantify. I think if he played PG he'd be better; but ultimately I don't even like it when Dame Lillard or Kemba goes all tunnel vision mode at all. So I think I have a fundamental issue with the way he plays the game, especially on a Blazers team that notoriously struggled to get role players involved at times(Crabbe/Leonard/Harkless/Aminu/Layman; I think Dame could always drop dimes but he shifted his style to be more team-first over last few years)"

Here is my hot take. Revan has a terrible overall story. People love KOTOR and the twist, but it is the very definition of a Mary Sue. A Mary Sue is author insertion into a franchise where the character the author makes is the most powerful and important character in the universe, and is a representation of them.

You create your own character in KOTOR only to be told that your character is the most powerful and meaningful badass in the universe both both the Jedi and the Sith. But it was whatever you created and played with whatever personality you chose.

If you were to take someone off the street who had never played those games and had them read all about Revan on Wookiepedia, including the Revanchrist movement, what happened in the novel and SWTOR, they'd think Revan might be the single stupidest character in the Star Wars universe. And yet people worship him as the greatest character ever created in Star Wars because of their experience playing KOTOR."

The award is clearly based on his merits as an artist and the musical output he has (though, quite how he's being nominated for either of those is baffling as well), because if the BET Awards really wanted to become ""synonymous with powerful artistry and social commentary"", they wouldn't nominate a serial abuser.

And it's not just a strong character they seek, but the kind of strength that makes somebody else afraid-they want to assume a powerful enough to hold the enemy at a distance. These Sixes display a forcefulness that comes from no wanting to be weak, and they don't allow for weakness in themselves....""

"".....Sexual Sixes have a need not just for strength but for intimidation. As Naranjo suggests, this expression of intimidation is very much the essence of the character; if they appear strong, they won't be attacked. ....""

"".....Sexual Sixes give off the impression that they could get violent with anybody at any time, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that they have no fear. It is precisely out of a sense of fear that their anticipation of an attack comes-there is a somewhat paranoid imagining of danger, a belief that anyone can turn into a threat. However, these Sixes usually do not look afraid; their visible character could hardly be called ""fearful"" from the outside.

In contrast to the Self-Preservation Six, who backs away from threats, the couterphobic Sexual Six tends to move toward risky situations, feeling a sense of safety in actually confronting danger rather than hiding from it or avoiding it. They convince themselves (and others) that they are not victims of fear; they are convinced that fear is an emotion that should be eliminated systemically.....""

"".....The fact that these Sixes regularly move against danger (or perceived danger) can, at times, give them the appearance of a rebel, a daredevil, a risk taker, an adrenaline junkie, or a troublemaker. In some cases, Sexual Sixes may be prone to megalomania or having a ""hero complex."" In their own way, they seek to be ""good guys"" to avoid being punished. They may have the illusion that they are spontaneous, but they tend not to be.

Sexual Sixes tend to be very contrarian: they always have an argument at hand to refute and contradict an opinion. Instead of thinking in terms of ""best-case"" or ""worst-case"" scenarios, they think in terms of contrarian scenarios-if the trend is for others to focus on the worst, they will focus on the best; but if everyone is focusing on the best, they will assert the worst.....""

Quick question though: is the ""final tally"" record just the number of wins/losses/ties based on the percentages you assigned? Or is it a prediction for how things will shake out? Because if the former, then I'm counting 14-0-2...or am I missing a loss in there? And if the latter, are you actually predicting that Mahomes ends up in **two** overtime games that he doesn't manage to win? (Probably on some crazy 45-yard left-handed bomb, thrown off his back foot and over his shoulder, while scrambling backwards with his eyes closed, tbh.) Either way, nice work."

>Arguable the best in the league with 2 exceptionally fast receivers that almost no team will have an answer for. A+

I think you can argue some positives for the Chiefs WR group:

- They have a lot of speed.
- Tyreek Hill is a top 5 and potentially top 3 receiver in the league.
- They fit with Mahomes' skill-set very well.

But saying they are arguably the top WR-unit in the league feels pretty weak to me. The Bucs are clearly better while the Falcons might get my nod for #2. Then you have the Dallas/Cleveland/Chargers tier and an interesting young team in Denver. You have the ""if healthy"" groups like the Bengals with AJ Green and Houston with Fuller/Cooks.

I don't see the Chiefs with Hill (top 5) and Hardman/Watkins (not top 30) as a top 5 duo."

4172,2020-08-18 18:24:23,ic35g3,Ward was quietly one of the best CB in the league last year. Allowed like a 65 passer rating on targets.
4173,2020-08-18 15:44:31,ic35g3,Yeah that's a good point and it's not a huge difference in grade plus your d-line will help your secondary a lot by creating pressure.
4174,2020-08-18 16:36:41,ic35g3,"Honestly, the secondary might be the best part of the defense if you take out name recognition. The Chiefs were 5th in both passer rating allowed and interceptions over the entire season, and they were downright dominant down the stretch with the #1 pass defense in the league over the final 6 games; they allowed a passer rating of just 63.5 with 5 TDs and 10 INTs over that span."
4175,2020-08-19 05:59:07,ic35g3,"I'm honestly way more worried about our linebackers than the d-backs. Hitchens and Wilson are below average in both coverage and run-stopping, Willie Gay is just a rookie. I'd guess run defense will once again be the glaring hole on our team, which should be fine as long as the offense keeps scoring and not letting opponents run out the clock."
4176,2020-08-18 23:26:10,ic35g3,"This is one of my core beliefs about the off-season.  Some people will say that red zone success was bound to regress to the mean(along with all other stats if you revert them to average).  But there is a pretty glaring reason for the drop.  Kareem Hunt.

A big source of tough red zone yards for us was dumping the ball off to Hunt in the flat as Kelce and Hill were doubled and letting him beat a guy 1 on 1 for the TD."
4177,2020-08-19 06:11:17,ic35g3,Part of that was definitely due to losing Mahomes during the year. Matt Moore only went like 1/6 in getting TDs. It does help to be the best team at getting long TDs though.

No team is faster at the position and it's not like they're speedy Nelson Agholor. No team has more quality depth than the Chiefs in my opinion. What's you're argument for the Falcons? The 3rd and 4th slot on their depth chart currently is Russell Gage and Laquon Treadwell where the Chiefs have Mecole Hardman and Demarcus Robinson. I think a couple teams have a better receiver than Tyreek Hill but imo no team has a better 3rd or 4th option which is much harder to deal with because you can't double team a player as easily since they have other threats on the field.
4193,2020-08-18 15:48:34,ic35g3,"Hardman is just as deadly as anybody when hes targeted. He is extremely efficient with his touches and just because of the volume it isnt top tier.

That's kinda arguable. I mean last 6 games they won by...

* 7 (against Rivers, so that's good for 2 picks right there)
* 31
* 7 (pats)
* 20
* 23
* 10 (rivers again, probably 3 more picks).

It's like the best defense is a good offense. Jumping out to leads forces the other team to either pass a bunch or throw in the towel and bring out the 3rd stringers.

So my point is this: Was the defense good because the defense was good? or was it because the offense was great?

4226,2020-08-18 22:17:14,ic35g3,I think it is still a 16 game schedule but with expanded playoffs
4227,2020-08-18 22:21:25,ic35g3,You're correct my fault. I assumed that they would implement the playoff changes at the same time.
4228,2020-08-18 15:56:37,ic35g3,Who else do the washington football team even have though? Aj brown did not even look like a top 10 and you know it so why be disingenuous
4229,2020-08-18 19:41:59,ic35g3,"You played yourself in this comment. Hardman is a WR3/4. Robinson played more snaps last year (75%) to Hardman‚Äôs (45%). 

Did you just put Fuller/Cooks into the conversation? Really?"
4230,2020-08-18 18:21:15,ic35g3,"True.  I also like that he said ""most complete"" as it responds to the critics that say Kelce isn't as complete of a TE as Kittle because Kittle is viewed as a superb blocker.  

I guess I could rephrase it.  I'll edit it."
4231,2020-08-18 19:38:42,ic35g3,"Well, if you wanna talk about playoff wins, I'll be happy to salt those apples for you."
4232,2020-08-18 20:15:40,ic35g3,I think the guy above was being a little tongue in cheek with that remark.
4233,2020-08-18 20:48:28,ic35g3,I love me some Sorensen but it makes me a little nervous when he goes for solo tackles; seems like he goes for the big blow 'em up type hits more often than a solid wrap-up
4234,2020-08-28 04:27:53,ic35g3,"They were bad, until they found out Pennel is a monster against the run. Look at what happened in the AFC Championship. They flat out stuffed Henry time and time again. It's important to note that Pennel does have a two game suspension, but that's really not that long. I think once he comes back, the run defense will be just fine. Willie Gay with his insane closing speed will be pertinent to that as well."
4235,2020-08-19 14:26:47,ic35g3,"I trust the front office and I trust the coach. I just remember the past and Dustin has been the one constant. It's just sad, thats all."
4236,2020-08-18 16:11:39,ic35g3,"I never said AJ Brown was a top 10 WR in 2019. I said that he was way better as a rookie than Hardman was as a rookie. So if you‚Äôre grading the 2020 chiefs WR group on a Hardman projection that he‚Äôs a top-30 WR, then you‚Äôd have to project AJB as top 10, right?"
4237,2020-08-18 20:10:09,ic35g3,"Robinson is a 4th year player. Hardman is a sophomore expected to take the next step. The problem is the Chiefs have a #1 and then like 3 #3's.

If you don't think Fuller is an elite talent, you must not be watching much Texans football. His issue has always been health. He averaged more YPG in 2018 than Hill had last year. Obviously Hill dealt with his own injuries last year, but to disregard them completely is crazy to me. Cooks (4) has more 1,000 yard seasons than Watkins (1), Hardman (0), and Robinson (0) have combined."
4238,2020-08-18 20:51:40,ic35g3,I very much look forward to our matchup this year. And I like our budding rivalry.
4239,2020-08-18 20:59:09,ic35g3,"I agree forsure. All in the same it worked against king Henry, couple o big pops from Sorenson"
4240,2020-08-19 05:39:04,ic35g3,"Did you even watch the playoffs?  Dirty Dan got us to the promised land.

Smart!  Taps head"
4241,2020-08-18 16:12:57,ic35g3,Im saying the reason he seems better is volume. I would rather have hardman. He got targets due to not having the weapons the chiefs do. Hardman was better when he had the ball or was targeted.
4242,2020-08-18 20:15:53,ic35g3,"Watkins is easily a #2. Hill is what Fuller wants to be, but he is closer to Hardman. He has speed and then..? 

Cooks is definitely good, but not top tier.

It‚Äôs Hill>Cooks and Watkins=Fuller at best. Plus Hardman and Robinson> whoever BoB has traded yet. 

If you still had DHop this would be a real conversation."
4243,2020-08-19 14:40:52,ic35g3,"Yes, we did watch the playoffs. Mahomes and the offense (Hill/Kelce) got us to the promised land.   
Sorensen made like one or two good plays (and he's a liability vs the pass). He's way overblown for some reason, and a one dimensional veteran backup lol."
4244,2020-08-18 16:20:10,ic35g3,"Yeah...I mean on a per-target basis, Hardman was the best WR in football, statistically. I still wouldn't take him in my top 30 at the moment. Again, I'm bullish on Hardman and am excited to see him get a bigger role in the offense...I just think most rational, impartial NFL people would put Brown and McLaurin over Hardman at this point."
4245,2020-08-28 04:25:04,ic35g3,"Let's be honest though, one of those ""good plays"" was a tide turner at the absolute perfect time. The dude's got skills and smarts, otherwise they wouldn't have kept him around for this long."
4246,2020-08-18 19:25:34,ic0h6z,"It reflects why the south island has historically only won 30 odd out of 80 inter island matches.

I think the current squad does a reasonable job considering how fluid high school movements are these days. 

There will always be a few exceptions such as Goodhue should be considered a Northlander and Mackenzie is a southerner"
4247,2020-08-18 21:40:32,ic0h6z,Always wondered what would happen if they did a city vs country game unstead
4248,2020-08-19 08:19:14,ic0h6z,"I see one major mistake.

McCullum hasn‚Äôt kept wicket at the top level for a few years."
4249,2020-08-19 11:57:22,ic0h6z,McCullum is in the West Indies coaching in the CPL.
4250,2020-08-19 03:44:22,ic0h6z,Yeah I was surprised to see some of the cross island movement even at High School level. Do you think the flaws could be resolved by allowing players to make a one time eligibility choice?
4251,2020-08-19 03:27:46,ic0h6z,Interesting idea - playing age group town vs country was a vicious rivalry haha. How do you reckon they could define Town and Country on a national level?
4252,2020-08-19 04:00:17,ic0h6z,"No honestly I think the rules of first senior province is fine. We will always have a few outliers that seem strange but reality is MacKenzie first played for Waikato and Goodhue for the filth.

Although if that mullet doesn't scream Northlander I don't know what else does"
4253,2020-08-19 09:41:20,ic0h6z,I guess you could split it into the big cities like Auckland Wellington and Canterbury with more rural areas not sure tho youd probably have to go by high-school?
4254,2020-08-17 23:16:46,iboxx2,"I like that from the Ravens perspective you think you'll lose to the Chiefs, because from the Chiefs perspective, we think we'll lose to you. Should be a great game."
4255,2020-08-17 23:19:56,iboxx2,It's crazy how the Ravens went 14-2 last year and then just straight up got better this offseason
4256,2020-08-18 00:24:50,iboxx2,"3 most important things this season:

1. Yanda's replacement has to be at least decent.

2. The pass rush has to be much improved, can't bank on being ahead and blitzing all day.

3. One of Miles Boykin/Devin Duvernay/James Proche/?Dez Bryant? needs to put up decent numbers, because right now it's just Hollywood and Snead as our only proven WRs."
4257,2020-08-17 23:43:07,iboxx2,This makes me so hype for the season this year. I really hope we do something nice for Mo.
4258,2020-08-18 02:53:33,iboxx2,Jesus Christ you guys got Derek Wolfe AND Campbell
4259,2020-08-17 23:08:19,iboxx2,Yayyyyy I‚Äôve been waiting for this shit
4260,2020-08-17 23:10:10,iboxx2,This is the sexiest shit I've read all year
4261,2020-08-17 23:36:48,iboxx2,dude our fucking draft was so good lmao.
4262,2020-08-17 23:38:15,iboxx2,Week 17 should be an easy win if you're playing one single reddit user.
4263,2020-08-18 01:07:24,iboxx2,I‚Äôm a secondary Ravens fan and I give the Dobbins pick an A+. Best RB in this draft and my pick to win OROY.
4264,2020-08-18 15:37:57,iboxx2,"I believe the Ravens can win *less* games this year but still be a better team than they were last year.  It's incredibly hard to go 14-2 or better in consecutive years, but I think the Ravens win 11-13 games, but are a much more complete team than they were last year.

They had probably the best overall draft on paper this past April.  They've added Derek Wolfe and Calais Campbell - two incredibly disruptive pieces to their defensive line - and addressed their weaknesses through the draft and free agency.

Lamar is still Lamar - a transcendent talent who improves as the years go on (at least, that's what he did in college).  They still have the best coaching staff in the AFC North, and a top 3 overall coaching staff.  

My prediction?  12-4, #1 AFC seed, and Lamar repeats as MVP.  This Ravens team has no real weakness I can see."
4265,2020-08-18 00:03:56,iboxx2,"> Week 15: Jaguars
Prediction: Win
Calais gets to catch up with some old friends while sitting on the bench watching the Ravens offense pound the rock. Ravens cruise to victory.

I think this is the trap game, not the Colts. I just think Rivers is washed and didn‚Äôt fall into a significantly better situation than he had in LA. The suspected offense gameplanning in Jax will be much different from last year, supposedly featuring much more play-action. Minshew was the second best QB during play-action behind Ryan Tannehill, and if the LB corps for the Ravens isn‚Äôt completely shored up, they might have a field day. Add to that, every few years they seem to completely whip our ass, so I see that game as an L for our boys"

4267,2020-08-18 06:44:06,iboxx2,I would have given you gold if your explanation for the titans game was ‚Äúthe titans are hoes and on them we shall stunt‚Äù
4268,2020-08-18 12:39:00,iboxx2,"I honestly think 14-2 is in the cards again for next year. Not hard to imagine sweeping the rest of the North, and I wouldn‚Äôt put money on losing to KC. Not scared of the Rivers Colts either."
4269,2020-08-18 08:45:39,iboxx2,"What a solid draft, did the ravens snag the top 2 ILB prospects this year?"
4270,2020-08-18 15:09:19,iboxx2,I wonder what the overall combined W-L is from all these posts. I feel like every one has predicted 8-12 wins.
4271,2020-08-18 05:32:36,iboxx2,"""pass defense coordinator"" vs. ""defensive backs coach"" ‚Ä¶does that mean he also works with linebackers in coverage or something? Or does that include the pass rush and whatnot?"

4273,2020-08-17 22:58:50,iboxx2,Edit: After reading other reviews I see what they are now. Cool. Still wish all the hate in the world on you.
4274,2020-08-17 23:56:38,iboxx2,"Let‚Äôs see

Browns: Loss. They‚Äôve had your number the last couple seasons. When you have a team‚Äôs number you play with a sense you can do no wrong. 

Texans: Loss. I think people are going to be shocked how much better Watson plays when he isn‚Äôt trying to get the ball to one guy every time he drops back.

Chiefs: Loss. The defending champs roll.

Washington: Win. WFT d line gives the offense fits all day but your defense forces key turnovers and a score to get out with the W

Bengals: Win in blowout fashion. 

Eagles: Win. Your DL sets the tone early and doesn‚Äôt let up.

Steelers: Loss. It looks like a surprise now, but it won‚Äôt be at this point in the season when MVP front runner Big Ben torches your vaunted secondary.

Colts: Loss. Another surprise team that won‚Äôt be a surprise by this point of the season.

Patriots: Win. Remember what I said about having a team‚Äôs number?

Titans: Win, but by the skin of their teeth. Missing Casey in the middle is the difference maker.

Steelers: Loss, but in a much closer game than the earlier one.

Cowboys: Loss. Dak is in a contract year and the Boys look like the crown jewel of the NFC East this year.

Browns: Win, because Cleveland will be trying to make a push for the final wildcard spot and needs this win bad. Nothing like spoiling a rival‚Äôs chances.

Jags: Win in one of the fastest games in NFL history that breaks combined rushing records.

Giants: Loss. Danny Dimes proves he‚Äôs for real and shreds that secondary to the tune of 300+ and 4 touchdowns. 

Bengals: in a meaningless game to end a disappointing season, Joe Burrow leads the team down the field for a game winning field goal.

Final record 7-9, projected third AFC North.

Hate on me all you want, I‚Äôll be saving responses and showing receipts at season‚Äôs end."
4275,2020-08-17 23:28:26,iboxx2,Agreed. It has become my most anticipated matchup. Two strong explosive teams
4276,2020-08-17 23:38:28,iboxx2,I was so upset.....I had tickets to that game. Then because of COVID they canceled all the tickets. I knew that was going to be the best game of the season. I was really looking forward to seeing it in person.
4277,2020-08-17 23:51:15,iboxx2,From a neutral observer you guys have gone 2-0 against them the last two years and are a tough matchup on paper for them. Both close games though. Looks like a coin toss but Id lean Chiefs
4278,2020-08-17 23:17:55,iboxx2,I look forward to it. It's always close and exciting
4279,2020-08-18 02:13:15,iboxx2,I'm calling it now: it'll be the game of the year no matter who wins.
4280,2020-08-18 17:39:42,iboxx2,"Mahomes is basically QB Jesus. It‚Äôs a near guaranteed loss in my book. Unless your defense regresses to 2018 level, it might not be competitive."
4281,2020-08-18 00:06:58,iboxx2,"Their offense and the Steelers defense I suspect will have a very similar situation, in that they played so far above what they should have it will be very difficult to repeat, even with personnel improvements"
4282,2020-08-18 15:31:33,iboxx2,Derek Henry has that effect.
4283,2020-08-18 15:36:05,iboxx2,I feel good about Boykin. He's a year 2 now and had flashes last year.
4284,2020-08-18 20:13:33,iboxx2,sorry
4285,2020-08-18 02:41:18,iboxx2,"I loved both Queen and Dobbins coming out of the draft. Dobbins is gonna feast with Lamar. Queen needs to develop, but your guys coaching staff is fantastic at getting raw players to play up to their potential. I could really see a Colts/Pats type of rivalry forming between the Chiefs and Ravens. It's going to be great for football but terrible for my liver."
4286,2020-08-18 12:06:16,iboxx2,For me the trap game is @philly. Carson wentz is a good QB and playing at philly is tough. Wouldn‚Äôt shock me if that was the game we dig a small hole at the beginning and just can‚Äôt seem to do anything to get out.
4287,2020-08-18 06:42:42,iboxx2,"Roughly, yeah."
4288,2020-08-18 16:11:18,iboxx2,800 pounds of force and fury...

4290,2020-08-18 14:07:33,iboxx2,"It's definitely possible, ultimately I think the post season is where their goals are so just getting there healthy is the main focus."
4291,2020-08-18 14:05:22,iboxx2,"I wouldn't say they had the top two, with players like Isaiah Simmons and Kenneth Murray going to other teams, but I do think they snagged the best duo of any team, Harrison and Queen compliment each other really well."
4292,2020-08-18 15:30:56,iboxx2,"August is the month when hope springs eternal.  That said, I think 12 wins for the Ravens is pretty non-controversial."
4293,2020-08-18 15:15:30,iboxx2,I assume that a pass defense coordinator is involved in deciding how certain coverages are played and how/when things are passed off. Db coach is mostly gonna be concerned with technique.
4294,2020-08-17 23:12:37,iboxx2,Have you not been paying attention to the other reviews?

4296,2020-08-17 23:27:08,iboxx2,"He pointed at issues the ravens may have, like the inexperienced linebackers  and the loss of Yanda. They lost barely any starters, have the same coaching staff, and went 14-2 last year.  He also consistently brought up the loss to Tennessee last year.  Now I understand that it was in the context of fixing the issues the Ravens had in that game.... but that's what a good front office does."

4307,2020-08-18 05:57:29,iboxx2,"Let's see

Browns: You don't know what ""having a teams number"" means. the past 3 years the Ravens and Browns split games and prior to that it leans Ravens. Please research before you state nonsense.

Texans: Hopkins had 12 targets that game, the 2nd receiver had 7. This is pretty normal for a #1 receiver especially one of his talent. There was no forcing the ball and Watson will be throwing to a weaker group this time around.

Steelers: Roethlisberger is 1 year older coming off a season ending injury to his throwing arm. With his style of playing football he will be lucky to play the full year. The Steelers will win because of their defense not their offense, they will be torching nobody.

Cowboys: Are a terrible road team more often than not. People seem to forget that McCarthy had his issues too, such as an inability to adapt and he is coming from Aaron Rodgers to Dak Prescott, there is a drop off in talent even considering Rodgers being in his later years.

Giants: Are playing for a top pick. Daniel Jones going to do what with who playing at the WR position? Quit playing.

&#x200B;

Overall your predictions are trash. Can i see the Ravens losing some of those game? Yes but not for the reasons you gave because your reasons are garbage.

4312,2020-08-18 00:38:30,iboxx2,I'd lean Chiefs too if it was at home (even few fans) or neutral site. But there in Baltimore you just don't know.
4313,2020-08-18 05:07:06,iboxx2,i think it will be a better defensive game than it will be offensive. I think some freak of nature happens where washington and NYG end up with like a 60-62 game lol
4314,2020-08-18 20:12:34,iboxx2,Jesus was only mortal lol
4315,2020-08-19 18:36:11,iboxx2,The differences between being good and being elite might rest on what we get out of Miles Boykin and Jaylon Ferguson.  They're the young players most likely to step up into our biggest needs.

4319,2020-08-18 15:35:25,iboxx2,"Yeah Ravens at 12 wins is fine. I think ESPN has the same issue with their team by team schedule predictions, lots of optimism but in reality there aren't enough wins to go around."
4320,2020-08-18 15:40:36,iboxx2,"It means very little but we're coming off 14-2, have the easiest projected SOS and I think we don't travel a lot again. Chips are falling that way but we obviously won't know till the games happen."

4328,2020-08-18 00:13:11,iboxx2,So you dominate vanilla schemes and scrubs? What an accomplishment.
4329,2020-08-18 06:35:28,iboxx2,"The Browns are the only team in the league that have proven they can slow down Lamar more than once.

Texans: Do you know how many sacks Watson took last year waiting for Hopkins to get to the top of his routes? Those don‚Äôt go in the book as targets.

I am a huge believer in Big Ben coming back, but I‚Äôll concede that this prediction could easily make me eat crow, that said, I‚Äôm standing by my prediction Ben is a top 3 QB next year.

McCarthy was a god at getting his team ready to play out of conference foes on the road."

4331,2020-08-18 08:24:12,iboxx2,"Yeah, imo the real matchup is between our secondary (best in the league) against the Chiefs passing (best in the league)."
4332,2020-08-18 08:25:59,iboxx2,"Maybe it hasn't been long enough yet, but even after losing to you guys twice, I don't hate the Chiefs even a fraction as much as I hate the Steelers/Pat's, who we swept last year.

It's actually cool to see another QB with similar accolades to Lamar. 2nd year MVPs and whatnot. Hopefully Lamar's 3rd year as a starter goes as well as Mahomes :')"
4333,2020-08-18 23:47:38,iboxx2,"Yeah I agree with that analysis, the Ravens are very thrilled to grab the duo they did."
4334,2020-08-18 15:59:15,iboxx2,"The Ravens could finish with 10 wins and I would think that it was OK.  They must have had some bad bounces, an injury or maybe they struggled to replace Yanda.  I'd be a little disappointed, but not surprised.  

The Ravens could have 14 wins.  I'd figure that they didn't miss a beat from last year, and they did a good job avoiding a letdown and minimizing the winnable games that slip through their fingers.  I'd be pleased, but not surprised.  

Honestly, I think that what I think about the Ravens this year depends more on the playoffs than the regular season.  If they miss the playoffs or go one-and-done, then it'll be a disappointing season.  If they play in the Superbowl, then that will be an amazing success."
4335,2020-08-18 21:58:22,iboxx2,While you ‚Äúwant‚Äù we‚Äôll be watching the Browns fail.
4336,2020-08-18 00:13:18,iboxx2,"Idk, imagining the face of a Cleveland-dweller every time they accidentally click on modellwithlombardi.jpg makes me all warm and fuzzy"
4337,2020-08-18 03:35:32,iboxx2,"Lol, I don't know what you said in your original comment, but you're definitely right here. I hope the Steelers, Browns, and Bengals fail miserably every week and I wouldn't expect anything less of other fans. I can still be civil while hoping their team goes 0-16."
4338,2020-08-18 00:19:16,iboxx2,"Bottom feeders such as the 49ers, Seahawks, Bills, Texans, Patriots, and Rams?"
4339,2020-08-18 00:20:58,iboxx2,"Tough schedule? 2020 is projected to be easier than the one we had last year. Not that I put much stock in preseason projections given that a lot can change, but your claim that we have a tough schedule ahead of us is blatantly false."
4340,2020-08-18 05:11:55,iboxx2,"What the hell are you talking about? We had one of the toughest strengths of schedule of any team last year and still only had two losses.

Playoff teams: Patriots, Chiefs, Seahawks, 49ers, Texans, Bills. We went 5-1 

Rams and Steelers both narrowly missed the postseason too and we went 3-0 against them.

We have the easiest strength of schedule this upcoming year since we play the NFC East and AFC South.

Thanks for letting us know that you have no idea what you're talking about though, dumbass."
4341,2020-08-18 15:11:39,iboxx2,You mean the patriots team that was being compared to the best defense of all time?
4342,2020-08-18 01:09:50,iboxx2,I‚Äôm glad you got your notifications numbers up since clearly that‚Äôs all you did this for

<_<"
4344,2020-08-18 03:22:05,iboxx2,At least it won‚Äôt be to their benefit like the last two years. Arrowhead is notoriously tough to play in so a neutral field should help a lot.
4345,2020-08-18 19:47:48,iboxx2,Hopefully the goodwill continues as the rivalry grows. But if the twitter trolls I've seen from both of our fan bases already is any indication...lol
4346,2020-08-18 16:10:10,iboxx2,"Wholeheartedly agree with everything you've said here. This year feels like 13-3 with a decent playoff run. A few things need to come together. 

This franchise spoils us."
4347,2020-08-18 23:21:55,iboxx2,We will see
4348,2020-08-18 00:17:29,iboxx2,It only gets funnier every year because the browns keep getting worse every year.
4349,2020-08-18 03:50:15,iboxx2,Oh I was civil. I said sarcastically I was shocked seeing a pro ravens breakdown written by a raven fan. And of course raven fans got their panties in a bunch. And I like how people downvoted my last reply acting like they don‚Äôt hate on other teams in their division. At least you are keeping it real.
4350,2020-08-18 01:12:53,iboxx2,"Lol the guy can‚Äôt even respond to this one. We played and beat the best of the best all season long (besides the chiefs).  The 3,4, and 5 seeds in the afc. The 1 seed and the other team that was 1 game away from the 1 seed in the nfc."
4351,2020-08-18 00:23:42,iboxx2,"Because I‚Äôm not basing that opinion on last year, I‚Äôm looking at how teams have changed for better or for worse. Your schedule is brutal."
4352,2020-08-18 15:35:07,iboxx2,"Technically correct, you don't slow us down so much as you outpace us."
4353,2020-08-18 19:51:17,iboxx2,"Ha, if I judged any fanbase off of twitter, I'd hate damn near everyone.

/u/everymanawildcat made a pretty funny gif over on our sub about how different the disparity really is. Can't wait for more Ravens/Chiefs gif wars for the years to come."
4354,2020-08-18 04:08:52,iboxx2,"Oh, I didn't mean to imply I didn't think you were civil, I just meant that as long as people keep it civil it's no big deal.

Haha, but yeah, everyone hates their rivals. That's the goal of divisions in the first place, to build a rivalry. I'm not sure why anyone would claim otherwise."
4355,2020-08-18 05:12:44,iboxx2,The schedule against the shitty NFC East and the AFC South? So brutal.
4356,2020-08-18 01:10:30,iboxx2,Unlike the one they  had last year? Didn‚Äôt we they also get better too?
4357,2020-08-18 04:15:22,iboxx2,Yeah it‚Äôs something weird about society today. Like it‚Äôs wrong to hate others. Everyone has to be nice and hold hands and shit. I don‚Äôt know. And watch like my last post I will be downvoted again. Probably another raven fan. Haha who cares. See you game one. I hope we are ready.
4358,2020-08-17 19:56:29,ibkj5r,"Also currently on my rewatch. As I got older, I also noticed the corruption and schemes way more. The current debates were also already present in the show. Truly ahead of its time."

4361,2020-08-17 20:09:55,ibkj5r,"I‚Äôm watching it for the first time and loving it. Currently on season 2. The show just feels so real and authentic, it just feels like watching real life play out."

4364,2020-08-17 20:07:12,ibkj5r,The Wire is the show I‚Äôve ever seen that I enjoy exponentially more every time I rewatch it. It‚Äôs just so dense and full of so many moving parts that it‚Äôs impossible to fully appreciate after only one viewing.
4365,2020-08-17 23:01:13,ibkj5r,"I re watched it this year and then read the book(s) it was based on as well as 2 behind the scenes books and it just opens up the show a lot more. Seriously, one of the best shows of all time."
4366,2020-08-18 03:05:07,ibkj5r,Just finished this show today! Loved every episode and this show is spot-on.

Esspecially First season is best as it can get."
4377,2020-08-18 13:17:28,ibkj5r,It's as boring or as exciting today as it was when it aired. You need to give it time.

4380,2020-08-18 19:15:31,ibkj5r,Sure. Different people have different tastes. A show can't please everyone.
4381,2020-08-17 02:54:14,ib5khr,"Rocky 3. When they ask Clubber if he would except the challenge of a rematch. ""I don't really consider it a challenge but I would be happy to beat up on him some more"" May be the most awesome line in cinema history"
4382,2020-08-17 02:36:24,ib5khr,I‚Äôd bump Creed over Rocky 3... and agree with the rest
4383,2020-08-17 03:35:55,ib5khr,">Rocky V -- No.

As I recall, that's the one where he had a protege whose name was literally Tommy Gunn and that apparently wasn't good enough to be his ring name without adding ""The Machine"" in the middle.

Probably the single worst piece of writing in the history of fiction."
4384,2020-08-17 03:02:38,ib5khr,"Im with you on Rocky III. It's the most entertaining one and I dont get bored throughout. It has a nice classic sequel hero plot structure, hero on top - defeated by a new stronger threat - comes back again (but with help from a former enemy) - comes out on top. Mr.T was great, Mickey's death was sad, cool to see Apollo helping out Rocky.

Rocky IV had a better villain but the movie was a drag. There's a full music video montage that stops the movie in the middle and recaps previous movies. If you're marathoning the whole series, this is your bathroom or kitchen break LOL"
4385,2020-08-17 11:00:56,ib5khr,"1, 4, Creed, 3, Balboa, C2, 2, and... nope, that's all of them!

Seriously, Rocky 4 is one of my absolute favorite movies. It is pound for pound one of the most entertaining movies ever made and has one of the best, 3-dimensional villains ever created.

I have drunkenly ranted on the movie's best, most quotable, most deceptively complex, and most meaningful line for a half hour. ""I must break you.""

Edit: Also, R4 isn't propaganda. It's anti-propaganda. It's about how we're all more similar than we think and can change and get along in the world."
4386,2020-08-17 02:40:56,ib5khr,"I don‚Äôt really like sequels or remakes or reboots. But Creed was excellent imho. I could have done without all the other Rocky‚Äôs and just had the original and this one. Creed 2 is amazing too. I don‚Äôt think people give it enough credit for being a fantastic film about family, the final shot of Drago (spelling) running silently with his son....more emotional than anything in any of the Rocky sequels."
4387,2020-08-17 03:22:31,ib5khr,"I was surprised when I did my own series run through last year that Rocky III was so high up and IV so low. It's easily the most entertaining of them all.

Also, fuck Paulie. Seriously."
4388,2020-08-17 03:25:20,ib5khr,Completely agree. Actually Rocky III might be my favorite if I‚Äôm being honest.
4389,2020-08-17 04:01:44,ib5khr,">Rocky II... I bet most probably have this higher.  

Only if they haven't seen it in a while! R2 is absolutely lacking, though from the moment when Adrian in the hospital says ""Win"" before the fight, the adrenaline starts pumping.  

I like all your rankings. You've got a good perspective on the series. And R3 is definitely a ton of fun."
4390,2020-08-17 05:40:08,ib5khr,"I love Rocky 3 idk it‚Äôs just always been my favorite, people have it lower but I think 2 is a great spot. But I‚Äôm a sucker for Rocky 4 LOL it‚Äôs so corny and is just an 80‚Äôs action movie, but dammit I like it unfortunately ahh"
4391,2020-08-17 14:50:52,ib5khr,"I always had a real soft spot for Balboa, probably my fav after Rocky"
4392,2020-08-27 18:29:13,ib5khr,"Funny enough I‚Äôm watching Rocky 4 right now(Heart‚Äôs on Fire is motivational as hell!).

Rocky > Rocky 3 > Creed > RB > Rocky 2> Creed 2 > Rocky 4 > >>>>>>>>>> no it never happened!"
4393,2020-08-17 18:10:26,ib5khr,"Oh yea... Rocky V was a thing... Huh...



*Proceeds to move on with my life*"
4394,2020-08-17 06:41:30,ib5khr,"Rocky, Rocky 2, Rocky 4, Creed, Balboa, Rocky 3, Creed 2 and then Rocky 5. 

Rocky 3 and 4 are just weird though when they get to those horrible scenes with his son. They destroy all momentum, the kid is a horrible actor and obviously doesn‚Äôt want to be there, and its just so stilted. They‚Äôre almost gayer than the Beach running scene."
4395,2020-08-17 04:00:13,ib5khr,You went with this one?  It‚Äôs great but ‚ÄúI pity the fool‚Äù is from this movie.  One of the most iconic lines in all cinema and spawned millions of fans to watch countless episodes of The A-Team expecting to see it
4396,2020-08-17 02:38:20,ib5khr,"Yeah that was a close call. Creed is probably the better film overall, I just love Rocky 3. Those are probably interchangeable for me."
4397,2020-08-17 03:54:37,ib5khr,"The really funny part was when ""Mr. Gunn"" attempted an actual real life boxing career."
4398,2020-08-17 04:07:04,ib5khr,">Rocky IV had a better villain  

Eh, I'd say R4 had a better villain *concept* (essentially the USSR government at the height of the cold war), but Clubber Lang was much more compelling than Ivan Drago. Mr. T definitely brought it for this role."
4399,2020-08-17 03:08:08,ib5khr,"Totally agree with everything here. 

I mean, I still enjoy Rocky 4, but I don't remember it being that cheesy or over-the-top 80's when I watched it as a kid. For context, I didn't see most of these during the time frame they came out, I am in my late 20s."
4400,2020-08-17 03:19:33,ib5khr,IV works for me because I find the Apollo stuff really compelling. It's cheesy but his death is really moving after four movies. That Creed/Balboa relationship is so wonderful.
4401,2020-09-07 03:14:41,ib5khr,We have the same list!
4402,2020-08-17 18:18:11,ib5khr,"Yeah, propaganda was too strong of a word on my part. I think it certainly seemed it for much of the movie, then finally relayed the message you point out, at the end. I DO like Rocky IV! Me and my dad just found it a lot sillier than we remember."
4403,2020-08-17 19:38:24,ib5khr,"Without all the Rocky movies, could you have Creed?

I mean isn't Rocky IV is the basis for Creed I and II?"
4404,2020-08-17 09:23:38,ib5khr,"> Also, fuck Paulie.

Agreed. The dude deserves his own Grandpa Joe Hate subreddit.

 1 - Rocky 

 2 - Rocky II

 3 - Rocky Balboa

 4 - Rocky III

 5 - Creed

 6 - Rocky IV

 7 - Creed II

 8 - Rocky V"
4405,2020-08-17 13:20:33,ib5khr,"No I don't hate Balboa, but I do pity the fool. And I will *destroy* any man who tries to take what I've got."
4406,2020-08-17 04:11:47,ib5khr,I mean...Tommy Morrison already had a real life boxing career and attempted acting. He held the world heavyweight title defeating George Foreman in 1993. Maybe I misunderstood your comment but Tommy was a legit professional boxer till he contracted HIV.
4407,2020-08-17 04:21:48,ib5khr,Huh? The dude was a great boxer lol
4408,2020-08-17 11:07:13,ib5khr,"Clubber is so one-dimensional, though. He's a great boxing villain with a mouth and no other characteristics. Drago is silent, stoic, deadly... a machine. Until he isn't, and we see that there's a person in there."
4409,2020-08-17 03:47:06,ib5khr,True. I also loved Rocky 4 as a kid (probably was my favourite). But of course I've grown to appreciate Rocky and Rocky III more as I grew up.
4410,2020-08-17 03:45:33,ib5khr,"Apollo's death and the final fight were definitely great. The stuff in between, not so much."
4411,2020-08-17 20:30:55,ib5khr,Well yeah but I hated rocky 4 so I would have been fine with creed explaining that his dad died in the ring and just not having to see a whole movie for that one little detail. Just have his mom say your dad died from all the beatings he took....
4412,2020-08-17 04:26:48,ib5khr,"No shit?

All I remember is him getting knocked out and his jaw dislocated on live PPV after Rocky V, Or maybe I'm thinking about someone else, idk...."
4413,2020-08-17 04:38:20,ib5khr,That may very well have been him. I seem to remember a couple of his losses being pretty bad but out of something like a 50 fight professional career he only lost maybe 3 or 4 fights.

4501,2020-08-29 23:45:07,i9nxz2,Thanks so what do you think about 13% for Diontae in this situation.  I might want to increase to 20+% if I want to be certain based on an early parris Campbell drop in this same league last year.  But I do think FAAB might be extra important this season so I‚Äôm debating whether I should increase the bid.

4505,2020-08-14 20:28:58,i9nxz2,"Yea I can understand that logic. I like pieces that I feel can go up in value now so that I can sell when I need other pieces, etc. we also don‚Äôt know that Pit won‚Äôt have a good QB next year or that the giants or Pit won‚Äôt draft a WR so to me I just take the guy I think is more likely to have more value at whichever point this year and figure it out from there as they are both young anyways, and I personally do believe in Diontae long term ESPECIALLY if they don‚Äôt keep Juju which I see as a realistic option based on the way they seem to be able to churn out decent WRs through the draft"

Big target competition this year. Ben‚Äôs future. If we assume Ben has two years left, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs left on Woods‚Äô contract right now as well.

Woods to me has legitimate top 8 WR ability and opportunity in that offense when you look at last season and the fact he very likely scores more than 2 TDs lol."
4508,2020-08-14 17:04:04,i9nxz2,Sadly. I would flip him for a first straight up now (which isn‚Äôt such a hard ask)

Yet somehow I think they got significantly better on paper. Emmanuel Sanders is a great addition and addresses the closest thing to a need they have. Ruiz is going to work wonders for the offensive line, in our big losses recently it's been due to the offensive interior not holding up. If we had Ruiz past year, the Falcons and Vikings losses would have been much different. Malcolm Jenkins will be an upgrade at safety this year, though I wish we had kept Bell for the long term.

This group is another one that didn't see too much major turnover. Cameron Jordan seemingly gets better every year and is one of the best defenders in the league. Sheldon Rankins will be another year removed from his Achilles injury. David Oneymata, Malcolm Brown and Shy ""Matt Ryan's Dad"" Tuttle will rotate through the defensive tackle spots. All three of them offer something and proved last year to be very effective, especially against the run. Davenport has shown some tantalizing attributes and flashes of play in his time here, putting up 10.5 sacks and 4 FF in 26 games, he has just had problems staying healthy. Hopefully, this year is the year where he fully realizes his potential. The primary pass rushing back up is Trey Hendrickson who had a nice bounce back season last year after only playing 5 games the year prior. Zack Baun should factor in heavily as a sub package edge rusher to help shore that area up. Margus Hunt is the only interesting name out of a handful of other players I didn't list, mainly because they dont have much of a shot cracking into this group.

The saints linebacking group revolves around Demario davis. An All pro last year he looks to continue his play going forward. Anzalone has had injury issues but is a good cover linebacker when healthy. Alonso tore his ACL late in the year but definitely provides a spark on defense and is a solid sub guy. Robertson has been a long time ST captain and spot sub. He is good in coverage but over pursues in run support. Great locker room presence. Bradham and Chickillo come from the eagles and Steelers and both factor as depth. Kaden Ellis has been hurt basically his entire time in the league and Baun will probably supplant him for his roster spot.

This position will be the most interesting to watch as it evolves and cements over the season. Marshon Lattimore being CB1 and Marcus Williams being the starting FS are the only 100% sure things I see here. Janoris Jenkins starting opposite Lattimore is pretty likely as well. Duce and Williams will be employed all over the defense as nickel and dime backs as well as playing 3rd safety. Malcolm Jenkins will function as the starter in a more traditional SS position. Robinson and Hardee are competing for a roster spot in my eyes, as are Hampton and Swearinger. Gray is a roster lock as he made the AP as a STer last year. This group is extremely talented as long as they all communicate and function well mentally.

Drew Brees is eternal, even after his freak thumb injury he came back and dominated the regular season. He didn't fall back to earth until the Vikings playoff game, where he struggled to get the offense going and was *hot take alert*  outperformed by Taysom Hill. I think it might be a mental thing where Drew wants to get through to another ring so badly he forces stuff he normally wouldn't in the regular season. And, I wont say it's an age thing, because his December stat line was a blistering 138.8 passer rating throwing for 1188 yards and 15 TDs/0 INTs. Jameis Winston looked at how Teddy Bridgewater parlayed being Drew's backup into a payday and said ""Yes, please"" taking an absurdly low deal and bringing in a skill set that Sean Payton has to be giddy over trying to fix with QB coach Pete Carmichael. Taysom is Taysom, he thinks he is a franchise QB but I don't know if he will ever be more than a very good gadget guy while he is here. That might change if Brees has another injury or if we decide to say ""fuck it"" the year after Brees retires and start Taysom all year and see what happens. Tommy Stevens as mentioned above, is a poorer version of Taysom and will basically serve as Taysom insurance on the practice squad.

-

Two new faces here, Ty Montgomery and Michael Burton. Montgomery figures to be a backup returner and spot sub that can more closely emulate Alvin Kamaras role in the offense than either Murray or Washington. Kamara played through a knee injury throughout most of last year. Something that was readily apparent when you look at how he ran all over seattle then looked pedestrian for much of the season. Murray did very well as a starter in his place and should still see a fair amount of carries as Alvin has always been on a usage count under SP. Dwayne Washington is a core special teamer and I expect that to continue. 

-

Burton replaces versatile FB, Zach Line who retired this offseason. FB still features heavily in SP offense, at least compared to other offenses but Taysom Hill will probably eat up a majority of snaps at that position as an H-Back.

-

Overall the group is solid, the depth chart is set already 
and AK41 should come back swinging and have another 800/800 season. Maybe even gun for a 1k/1k like CMC.

-

Emmanuel Sanders instantly becomes the most talented WR the team has fielded opposite Thomas since Brandin Cooks was still here. He should feast in a offense where defenses also have to concern themselves with CGM, Cook, and Kamara...not to mention Taysom Hill and Deonte Harris. I doubt we carry 6 WRs so more than likely Lil' Jordan will wind up on the PS squad. Austin Carr would be a terrible divorce attorney because he cant get any separation but he is a good run blocker and STer. Deonte Harris returns after gaining an All Pro as a rookie returner and hopefully can expand his usage on offense making him even more dangerous.

-

Like most positions there isnt really any positions unsettled. This is Michael Thomas's world everyone else is just living in it.

Hey look another position group that is almost completely cemented. I think the Saints will be one of the teams least impacted by the pandemic and lack of training camp. Mainly because so many players are coming back and there is hardly any major churn. Cook will hopefully be able to play a full season at 100% even though he played very well last year. Josh Hill is probably in the tier right below the best guys like Kittle and Kelce as far as blocking goes. Trautman has good measurables and caught 31 TDs in college. Griffin is on his last shake to prove anything as he is out of PS eligibility. We probably only carry 3 TEs since Taysom takes so many snaps at TE.

-

Here is where we see our first really intriguing spot, because Emmanuel Sanders is valuable but a known quantity at this point in his career. The Saints are going to take Erik McCoy and push him to RG to fill the empty starter spot. Then Cesar Ruiz is going to start at Center, which as I said earlier, could end up being a brilliant move. Ram and Terron come back as one of the best, if not the best, tackle duos in the league. Andrus Peat was given a hefty extension this year, but I think he will ultimately prove to be worth it, if for nothing else he is extremely versatile and can play 4/5 positions on the line and could probably play center if the team asked him too. I didnt list all the linemen on the roster, just the ones I think the team will carry into the season. Easton and Clapp will be the backup guards, Tom will be the back up center, and Omameh will be the swing tackle. I dont really see this group changing and expect them to be more solid in the interior this year with the subtraction of Warford.

-

*This list isn't exhaustive but includes all the players who saw meaningful snaps*

-

The biggest departure here is probably Von Bell, hes a very smart safety who has a nose for returning fumbles (He had 5 last year). He is a versatile guy who has 8 sacks, 7 FF and 7 FR over 4 seasons with the team. The Bengals are getting a great guy on the defensive side, we just had too many good DBs to afford paying him $18M. A.J. Klein was a valuable part-time starter in his time here, he was a great locker room guy but is a bit limited athletically. Like Bell, he would've been worth keeping but not at $18M. Teddy Bridgewater is one of my favorite players in recent Saints history, but I dont think he is worth $21M a season and it was pretty much written on the wall when Brees decided to return that Bridgewater would be moving on, even though its to Carolina I wish him nothing but the best. Eli Apple had ups and downs during his 1.5 seasons with us, ultimately it ended up being mostly downs and he has also moved on to Carolina. Ted Ginn Jr. has regressed a bit over the last 2 seasons so it was the appropriate time to move on from him. Lastly, Larry Warford fell off a cliff in 2019, he regressed severely and was exposed in several games leading up to the being the main reason for the loss in the WC round. He has since opted out of the 2020 season due to COVID concerns.

| Taysom Hill | QB | 2 yr/$20M |

| Ty Montgomery | RB | 1yr/$1M |
| Margus Hunt | DT |  1yr/$1M |
| Nigel Bradham | LB |  1yr/$1M |

-

*This are the most impactful FAs from my perspective*

-

As I noted above, Malcolm Jenkins is one of the most respected leaders in the NFL. His skill set is a known quantity at this point and he should provide valuable locker room leadership. Emmanuel Sanders becomes the best WR across from Thomas since Brandin Cooks was still on the team. Jameis Winston for $1M is almost highway robbery. Burton will be replacing the retired Line. Chickillo and Bradham will shore up the linebacker depth. Ty Montgomery will be the best imitation Kamara we have in the RB group if Kamara gets hurt again. Overall outside of Sanders and both Jenkins signings this majority of these signings were either the usual churn at the bottom of the roster or just hanging on to players that are valued most in the Saints system (e.g. Taysom, Wood). Bringing Oneymata back at a reasonable price was a good win though.

The former might be true but the latter is no excuse for the ignorant stuff Drew said. Nor is donating millions. It's not like Brees is a sheltered suburban kid, he's a grown man. It's dismissive and shitty to pretend like he just couldn't have known better. He could have and should have. And he's acknowledged that, so I don't know why this post struggles to do the same. 

> Malcolm Jenkins is a hypocrite on a massive scale for going so hard on Brees and then essentially ignoring the antisemitism expressed by DeSean Jackson and other players and personalities.
> 

This is both wrong and irrelevant? Jenkins did address it, saying it was both wrong and that Jewish heritage and trauma should be honored. Just seems like you're trying to deflect and make excuses for Brees rather than acknowledge that he said something dumb and was rightfully called out on it. DeSean Jackson posted so terrible things. He deserves to be, and was criticized for it, and is arguably making amends. None of that invalidates that Drew said something insensitive, and comparing it to DeSean just to minimize it is a shitty move."

That's been less of a concern with every offseason though. Instead of drafting a successor they just focused on building a team that doesn't need elite QB play to succeed. Whoever takes over from Brees will have (fingers crossed) a bunch of veteran receivers, a strong running game, a great O-line, and a good-to-great defense to make their life simpler.

And whoever the next QB is, they'll probably be more mobile than Drew and be able to throw the ball deeper, which will give us some exciting new options for offensive play-calling. In any case the Saints definitely won't need to do a full rebuild after he's gone. It feels like this incarnation of the team has a long future ahead of it."

Dude is the unsung hero keeping the roster empty of very many holes while replacing valuable starters with, in many cases, superior and cheaper rookies. It allows them to trade 4th-7th round picks who probably won't make the team anyways into more talented players from higher rounds.

4594,2020-08-10 18:39:01,i7ahe0,Bought him yesterday and use him as my main scorer at PG off the bench. He‚Äôs amazing
4595,2020-08-10 18:41:05,i7ahe0,He‚Äôs really good. Most people never tried him until recently because of his price.
4596,2020-08-10 18:38:12,i7ahe0,"I like him, too. But I‚Äôve heard people say that he isn‚Äôt quite fast enough compared to other players.

Maybe not fast enough for PG, not big enough or a good enough true shooter for SG?

Either way, most of it is personal preference and I am liking him. Maybe not starting lineup, but very very close."
4597,2020-08-11 03:18:43,i7ahe0,Don‚Äôt listen to what anyone says. Especially since it‚Äôs august. Keep using him if you like him. People always shit on goat Kobe but he‚Äôs still a monster for me
4598,2020-08-10 21:44:23,i7ahe0,I love his card. Been wanting it since release and finally packed him. Just locked in Scottie for the duo

4600,2020-08-11 00:05:14,i7ahe0,"Personally I have and use him on my bench but there is a lot to be said about animations in the game. I think it‚Äôs hard sometimes for people to separate the card from the real life players. It‚Äôs MJ, we know he‚Äôs the greatest ever but in a game where the fastest release and height are what‚Äôs mostly important, he falls short. He‚Äôs got a good dunk package that you can abuse but beyond that, he‚Äôs not really that great in the games meta."
4601,2020-08-10 19:52:22,i7ahe0,I love the card. Best off dribble shooter in the game. Athletic 2 or whatever he has is just so fluid and easy to green compared to other leaners. Only complaint I have is his layup package has some dumb ones. Sometimes when I think I have a dope contact dunk lined up he goes way up and then does that classic Jordan switch hands in mid-air and throw it up on the way down layup and it just never works in 2k. Its always like an 80% contested complete fail.

4633,2020-08-08 20:38:49,i63rrp,"This is one of few posts I read every word in, pretty good post!"
4634,2020-08-08 21:41:48,i63rrp,"I agree a lot actually. I only have a different order for Cyan, Lime and Blue (Cyan 5th, Lime 4th and Blue 3rd) but it's too tight to be sure."
4635,2020-08-08 22:30:18,i63rrp,"This was a really good post. Read it all the way through.

Personally I think all Pink really needs to manage to do is be top 2 prior to dodgebolt (as you've predicted). If they can do that they've probably got MCC 8 in the bag. Dream and Techno are both very good shots and practice... a lot. Feel pretty confident that Pink would do well in dodgebolt. Intimidation factor associated with both of the aforementioned S tiers could also come into play with regard to team morale... giving them a boost and anyone else a slight performance decline (ie. more likely to be hesitant or panic, and therefore be less likely to advance and take fewer shots... I'd site situations like MCU, where a group with 10 to 1 numerical advantage failed to swarm Techno and essentially scattered anytime he moved towards them with few exceptions).

Perhaps I'm too confident here, but I think Pink has some seriously good odds of winning if they make it to dodgebolt. 3/4 of their players have played dodgebolt before and the 4th is Dream... who practices obsessively and (if his manhunt videos are any indication) is accurate under pressure regardless."
4636,2020-08-08 18:47:56,i63rrp,"The individual predictions are really interesting to look at. I was just wondering, why did you put Dream and Techno‚Äôs range above Pete and Quig‚Äôs? Historically, they aren‚Äôt held back by teammates when it comes to individual scores"
4637,2020-08-08 23:38:56,i63rrp,"I think Cyan is going to be held back because the problem you mentioned: They don't really know each other. I was watching Sparklez' stream today and it seemed fairly clear he doesn't really know TapL, and it seems he hasn't practised with them all as he did with his previous team.

Dream and Techno have no doubt been preparing religiously, and while their overall team might not be as stacked on paper, I think they'll have better teamwork. Michael and Burren also obviously have good teamwork together, and if anyone would kick them back into MCC 1 form it'll be Techno and Dream."
4638,2020-08-09 00:31:57,i63rrp,"I think your over estimating lime a bit, yeah they've won with a similar team before but they don't have H. Without another person that's good at pvp I don't think they will do as well especially with how the other teams are looking. I think because there are so many good teams that are in the running to win I don't think they will do as well. Also all of the teams that are probably going to do well are good at PvP and personally that's what I think lime is lacking in."
4639,2020-08-09 12:47:39,i63rrp,"Hello,I just Read your whole post and I find it interesting...Do you think you can make a player list?(Cause of your individual ranking and stuff.)"

4646,2020-08-10 02:38:17,i63rrp,"Pink parrots will obviously be targeted, but if dream and techno really try and Michael and burren try like they did in mcc 1, then they have this in the bag, but i do think cyan has a good chance, it seems obvious that cyan and pink are gonna face off at the final battle, it depends if they take out TapL, jordan, and Mefs fast."
4647,2020-08-10 23:50:14,i63rrp,"The only thing I disagree with is putting mefs 3rd individual, he got fourth while being boosted by dream and as far as I know that's his only time in the top ten he's still cracked though and I would put him at a range of 6th-20th

Edit nvm top ten in mcc 2"
4648,2020-08-08 21:49:40,i63rrp,"It's definitely tight! I do see Blue coming 3rd as well. It really comes down to the games chosen and the order they are played in. Only a week away from mcc, I'm so excited!"
4649,2020-08-08 22:55:11,i63rrp,"I agree with you on the intimidation factor Pink is going to bring to games like SG and Skyblockle. The only way they could avoid it is if they skip SG and target them early in Skyblockle before they get to the middle, cause otherwise people are going to be way too scared to attack them in the middle when they are already stacked and ready to attack everyone.

I agree with the dodgebolt point. I definitely see them crushing whoever they're versing. I just hope they don't dominate the whole event (like orange in mcc3 or purple in mcc4) because that wouldn't be as exciting as the past three mccs we've had (with all the cluthes)."
4650,2020-08-08 18:54:24,i63rrp,"The main reason I did that is because this mcc, Dream or Techno are most likely to come 1st since they have each other. Exactly how Pete is first when he's with HBomb or Vikk and how Quig is first when he's with HBomb or when he wins. The person who gets 1st individually is either a winner or has another S/A+ tier player in their team. Now, Quig has HBomb, but imo Dream + Techno combo is stronger. So, basically, I think Techno and Dream are gonna do individually better than Quig and Pete this mcc."
4651,2020-08-09 00:03:24,i63rrp,"Yeah. If they get to know each other before the tournament starts, maybe that could help? I mean, we've had teams like MCC2 Cyan, MCC6 Blue (i believe) who did good but seemed fairly unfamiliar with each other. It's not something that I can take into consideration when it comes to predictions cause they might get to know each other shortly before the mcc or they might have surprisingly good chemistry. Plus, one of them could overperform individually so the other teammates don't feel like they're dragging them down. It's super hard to predict those kind of things which is why I'm ending it here lol

And yes, Dream and Techno are, no doubt, going to bring Burren and Michael up. The teamwork is not what I'm scared of, but mostly how Burren and Michael will perform in games like Hole in the Wall and Ace Race, where teamwork isn't really that needed. But, as I already said, I think they'll come top 2 for sure. And therefore they have a very high chance of winning in my books. I'm like 90% sure they'll win."
4652,2020-08-09 00:43:59,i63rrp,"Katherine is really the only person on their team that isn't good at PvP. Martyn and Solidarity did good at Battle Box in mcc5 and are overall not bad at PvP.  
Looking at the history of the order of games, PvP games are usually chosen in the first half, so they won't matter as much. Now, that might change this mcc, but still, my point stands, I don't think they'll hurt them as much as TGTTOS will.   
Also, Mcc6 Orange (Pete, H, Martyn, Solidarity) didn't win, Blue did."
4653,2020-08-08 21:11:26,i63rrp,"I might be. I don't know how good Sapnap really is. George did worse his second time (from 12th in mcc6 to like 22nd in mcc7 I believe) and I heard somewhere that Sapnap is similar to George in terms of skill. If he gets top 10 again this mcc, or just does really good, then I'll change my opinion, but for now, I think 9th-19th is pretty good considering how stacked this mcc is."
4654,2020-08-09 00:31:09,i63rrp,"Who knows, it might happen. But looking at the games they won't be last at, the list is very small. Yellow has Rocket Spleef where they won't come last, and also Build Mart and Sands of Time that they're decent at. 

Really, the only way I see Orange in 9th is if the last three games are Skyblockle (all alive in the middle, claimed a tower - Like MCC3 Lime), Battle Box (rush strat - works best in Trenches - Like MCC7 Blue) and Survival Games (hide until the end - also like MCC3 Lime).  
But the chances of all that happening is low. Especially since no one is going to let the 3 PvP games be chosen at the end."
4655,2020-08-09 11:28:45,i63rrp,"Pink this mcc is super OP and people are, in my opinion, going to think that the only way they could defeat them is to target them early in Skyblockle (like knocking them off the bridge) or in Survival Games if they're brave enough. And for Tommy targeting Techno, it's a joke."
4656,2020-08-09 09:54:43,i63rrp,"I think your underestimating Callum, he has been in 6 mcc‚Äôs and has never dropped below 15th."
4657,2020-08-09 14:26:14,i63rrp,"Burren is good dude, I mean he is trying to win. 
But Micheal is a different story LMAO. 
it is still fair that Micheal won't try hard because there is no price money."

4659,2020-08-09 11:32:26,i63rrp,"I agree. Even though he has dropped below 15th (he came 19th in mcc6), he never dropped below 20th and plus, he has been practicing a lot. Calvin and Callum have great chemistry and with people saying SB is really good, I put them higher on the list."
4660,2020-08-09 00:27:28,i63rrp,Also we know that George SapNap and Eret have quite a bit of chemistry so that will be sure to help them out.

Fans of classic vector arcade games are in for a treat this month. Former project coordinator Aaron Giles has contributed netlist-based sound emulation for thirteen Cinematronics vector games.. ... This resolves long-standing issues with the previous simulation based on playing recorded samples.

That's pretty impressive! 

For those who don't know, a netlist is a list of the transistors, capacitors etc. required for a circuit; in this case, it means MAME will be producing the sound by calculating the electrical flow through the circuit and the way it changes over time, rather than just playing a sampled noise when required.


Does that extra processing require much extra CPU power?"

4727,2020-08-02 22:40:43,i2hk84,I feel he has a strange energy that makes him not so suitable for traditional good guy roles.
4728,2020-08-02 19:54:36,i2hk84,Outside MCU and Black Mirror I only remember seeing him in Altered Carbon season 2 and his performance was one of the main reasons I bailed on it early. Was not impressed and he in no way sold the idea that he was the same character from season 1.

Mackie is doing just fine. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs one of the greatest out right now but he‚Äôs a solid actor and has been in some great stuff."
4742,2020-08-02 20:01:44,i2hk84,"This. Just being a working actor (one that derives 100% of their income from acting or its related activities) is tremendously difficult. 

There are no official statistics, but anecdotally, less than 20% of all actors (meaning everyone you see, from the smallest roles to the largest, in every TV show and movie) are able to live solely on their acting income. 

Just getting into that 20% is a huge accomplishment. That doesn‚Äôt mean he doesn‚Äôt want more or to be a lead, but the majority of actors don‚Äôt. They just want to work."

4767,2020-09-05 20:39:56,in89gb,I don‚Äôt like affleck but I can understand and respect why people like him
4768,2020-09-05 20:40:51,in89gb,"!? People hated Batfleck, that's why DC's ditching him. You got it wrong.

Come on, Bale didn't  act that well. He played Bale like in all his other movies. It somewhat suited Batman but he didn't act specificaly for Batman, he acted as he always does.

On the contrary to Ben Afflec.

Being also a long time Batman reader, I fond the Nolan movie realy pitifull. Batman begins didn't blow my mind at all. I found Nolan's trilogy painfull to watch, with awfull scenarios and a buch of bad acting. And most of all awfull props, costumes and vehicules.

Only the Joker's performance lifted Nolan's trilogy.

As for Batflec movies. Stories weren't much better. But I found les divergence from the original material (the Batman comics).

But to me, the best to this days stays the Burton movies. Of course they have aged, but in their context they were much betterly done that any other.

&#x200B;

ps: your post is a bit long, many won't read it."
4769,2020-09-05 22:42:11,in89gb,"I honestly think people like Affleck for reasons completely unrelated to his performance (I know I‚Äôm getting downvoted, fuck it). 

First you have the Snyder cultists, who think that everything ZS does is a masterpiece: Affleck is ‚Äúhis‚Äù Batman. Brutal, cruel, and with limited empathy. The Randian ideal man, in contrast to Superman who‚Äôs ‚Äúboring because he‚Äôs overpowered.‚Äù I realize I‚Äôm painting with a broad brush here, but it‚Äôs a very cynical version of the character, and it seems to resonate with lots of people.

Next, they like him for what *could have been.* Affleck was in a supporting role, a cameo, and then a major role that was reshot and edited to hell. I think fans are projecting their ideal Batman onto him, even though he hasn‚Äôt had the screen time to justify it. 

Finally, I think there are some people who just like the aesthetic. He‚Äôs beefy and his costume is TDKR-inspired. It‚Äôs an iconic look, even if I personally don‚Äôt like it. The one scene I really enjoyed with Batfleck was the warehouse fight, and the entire thing was pretty much cribbed from the Arkham games. There‚Äôs a whole generation of fans that have grown up playing those games; to see that onscreen was to go, ‚Äúoh, this is my Batman.‚Äù 

Personally, I can‚Äôt wait for him to nobly sacrifice himself in Flashpoint and retire the cowl for good- but I get why others disagree."
4770,2020-09-05 21:23:57,in89gb,"Kevin Conroy had said that of all the Batman actors, Affleck had the best balance between Bruce Wayne and Batman. I would most certainly agree. Those moments when he‚Äôs in the cave, when he‚Äôs not putting on the billionaire playboy facade, when he‚Äôs not wearing the cowl to intimidate criminals, that‚Äôs who Bruce Wayne really is.

Bale had also said that he wished he got to portray Batman‚Äôs more animalistic side during Nolan‚Äôs trilogy, and once again I agree. I think Affleck nailed that part.

Plus visually speaking, I think Affleck is perfection.

And I do understand you didn‚Äôt like the story in BvS, but I very much did. Every live action Batman has killed, but this time it‚Äôs used to show how wrong it is."
4771,2020-09-05 21:11:50,in89gb,i still can‚Äôt understand how ben affleck was batman. a boston bro meathead??? who made that call
4772,2020-09-05 20:57:40,in89gb,"Did you really think TDK trilogy had bad acting? Kinda fear toxin you smoking? Bale had so many facial expressions and passion in this role. He literally gained 100lbs worth of muscle in 6 months! Do you know how hard that is to do? Affleck had no facial expressions and no uplifting stories of how he bulked up. Also the props and vehicles were meant to be in our real world. It was meant to not look nice but be functional.

Also comic accuracy matters in the sense of keep the characters the same, but make changes. If you make a Batman The Long Halloween live action movie. It would be good, but there's nothing to appreciate from the director because he didn't do shit but copy and paste. That's for animation not live action. I didn't want a Snyder's Dark Knight Returns fuck fest. He should've based it off of a lot of comics and then wrote in original stories. That's what Nolan did. 

Tim Burton didn't read a comic for shit. He got the aesthetic right, just like Snyder. But he didn't get the characters right. Batman is an emotionaless psychopath and Joker is a narcissistic douchebag. 

Also Ik my post is long but I don't care. If people are too lazy to read then they don't have the privilege to respond."
4773,2020-09-05 23:32:02,in89gb,This is the best comment I've ever seen.
4774,2020-09-05 21:35:32,in89gb,"Kevin Conroy is just an actor entitled to his own opinion. Like I said, I can see why people would like him. Also he has no facial expressions. It's just so bland and stale. It's like wanting a pbj sandwich but there's day old bread. You still eat and it's alright but it could've been better. Visuals is perspective so I'll give you that. 

The thing that bugs me the most is how people bring in that every Batman has killed excuse. Whenever you say that it's why Batman shouldn't, you do realize that Batman killing Two Face and being in depression is why he shouldn't kill? You do realize that him killing Talia was just to show you that he puts lives before his rule? 

Affleck's Batman kills so obnoxiously. I understand him saving Martha and him shooting KGBeast. I would actually like thay scene if he didn't murder a bunch of men in his Batwing. The Martha moment was meant to show you that Affleck has become Joe Chill. Too fucking bad he murders 20 guys with the Batwing 30 seconds later. If you took out all those unnecessary killing scenes and had a better actor. That would've been the best Batman ever. Too bad we got the Zack Attack."
4775,2020-09-05 21:15:01,in89gb,"It's a movie, it's supose to look nice and functional.

And the Bad acting wasn't only Bale. But all the cast.

Yes that's what Nolan did. He he took bits and pieces everywhere and glued them together badly. He shorten every storyline and ruined them. Banes origins for exemple,  Ra's and Talia Al Ghul stories, and much other things were ruined.

Either you take from he comics and make it good, or you have a totally new plot.

But that's what Batman and the Joker are ! Batman has no emotions when being Batman (at least in the modern age) and the Joker is narcissistic !

Burton got the esthetic much more rigth than Nolan ! Look at his Joker, look at his bat-costume, look at his batmobile, ... Nolan's on the other hand are off.

My point was, if you want your point to be heard, make it clear and simple. No long and unatractive."
4776,2020-09-05 21:40:45,in89gb,">him killing Talia was just to show that he puts lives before his own rule?

I‚Äôd argue the same can be said for Batfleck killing after his Martha moment. Martha‚Äôs life is literally on a timer, he doesn‚Äôt have the time to carefully take out each and every one of these thugs. As Diane Lane said, this is his chance to redeem that sense of helplessness he felt as a kid. He couldn‚Äôt save Martha then, but now he can."
4777,2020-09-05 21:28:07,in89gb,"The only thing I agree with you in this argument is the undeveloped Talia and Burton's aesthetic. Everything else is super silly. 

The cast of TDK trilogy did a fantastic job except for Maggie Gyllenhaal. You're telling me that Michael Cane did bad as Alfred? If you say yes then there is no hope for you. Also if you look at real life grapple guns, then you'll realize that they don't look to pretty. Just like military vehicles. I do hate Batman Begins' suit mainly because of the cowl, the cape material, and the body not being grey. 

Also Nolan did take bits from comics and it was great. I don't know what you're talking about? He took Knightfall and added in The Dark Knight Returns and many more with an original story. Bane's story was fantastic and is very comic accurate. The only problem I have with many other characters from this trilogy is the voice. 

Batman is not emotionless. He's a stiff person but you can feel his emotions from dialogue and as Bruce Wayne. That's how Batman is supposed to be. You can't have him be a murdering psychopath with a Bruce Wayne that isn't depressed and angry. Atleast BVS tried to do something with that. The Joker is not a narcissist. The only thing he wants to do is fuck with Batman. In the Arkham games he literally just wants Batman to break his rule and that's what makes him so compelling. He cares not just for himself but he cares about Batman because Batman is his best friend. Narcissist don't have best friends they care about."
4778,2020-09-05 22:02:56,in89gb,I just said that in my argument. That's what Batman is. He puts lives before the rule. Just like Bale killiny Two Face and Talia. Also letting Ras die was important because he got over the fear of making his father proud by letting a mad man lose. He knows Ras is unstoppable and he would break out. The Joker is a different story because he felt like he had a friend to relate to and he didn't kill him because he's the only one that truly understands him.
4779,2020-09-05 13:38:31,in1007,I feel like everyone keeps overlooking how awesome M‚ÄôBaku would be as the Black Panther. Not as lean but a powerful Panther. I also like Shuri taking over but  she seems pretty young and not ready to lead yet.
4780,2020-09-05 13:26:57,in1007,A lot of people aren't cool with a straight up text so an alternate T'challa might not be a smart move for Disney. The MCU has also been getting a lot of flack for bringing back dead characters so probably also not smart to crown Killmonger. I'm a fan of letting Shuri take the throne and become Black Panthress.
4781,2020-09-05 13:28:42,in1007,"I can see this thinking... but I wouldn't do it in Multiverse of Madness, not exactly. Post credits scene. Wakanda. Shuri finds Black Swan. They talk, Black Swan presses the detonator, but then gets taken down by... the recast T'Challa (whoever plays him). Film fades out with the destruction of planet Earth via explosion. ""The Multiverse Will Return""

And then *this* T'Challa isn't exactly the focus of the Black Panther movies, but instead a secret Shuri keeps in the City of the Dead... and this T'Challa is okay with this since his focus is on gathering a new Illuminati to save this new world, given *his* Illuminati failed to save *his* world."
4782,2020-09-05 13:28:54,in1007,"That‚Äôs brilliant. What about taking it a step further and have Jordan play the same character he did in Black Panther, but in that reality, his father never left Wakanda. He was never Killmonger, but grew up in Wakanda as part of the royal family."
4783,2020-09-05 14:22:30,in1007,"This has been suggested. Just search it ffs. Also, its dumb and disrespectful. Kind of baffling you cant see that."
4784,2020-09-05 15:21:09,in1007,Sooooo dumb
4785,2020-09-05 13:24:33,in1007,"That could work, if Micheal B. Jordan wants to do the role. They could either do it with Shuri like the comics does... Or Disney could be unethical and just use CG/Deepfake to put Chadwick in."
4786,2020-09-05 14:06:36,in1007,There is also Okoye.  It seems like she already took on something of a leadership role in Wakanda during the 5 year gap.  She is also a badass warrior and the actress could definitely handle it.
4787,2020-09-05 14:24:39,in1007,"How is it disrespectful - you allow a highly respected peer to give homage.

Its an idea - dumb is passing judgement."
4788,2020-09-05 14:35:17,in1007,"Repalcing a deceased actor with a deceased villain character (because multiverse!!) is a lazy, ""convenient"" concept. Multiverse shouldnt be used to pull shallow stunts like this one. Its transparent and comes across as fan service for the sake of fan service (even so, i imagine its not a huge percentage of fans). It does nothing for the film story wise. Its not a ""homage"".  Its a needless complication with too many stupid implications.
Also, its pretty tiring seeing the same discussions tale place over and over again. 
Leave the storytelling to the professionals at marvel studios."
4789,2020-09-05 16:15:38,in1007,"Villain's actor.

This proposal was for T'Challa to be played by Michael B. Jordan, not for Killmonger to be the new Black Panther.

Jetts looked rusty as hell, but this from the guy who holds the record for scoring shots without a goal. 

Ryan provided the target, Darling did way more than the wall of stats above suggests (please for the love of God get rid of it - sucks to scroll past, my Reddit app almost crashes trying to fucking load it)

Nic Nat dominant in the middle, but Williams showed some spark. If it wasn't for Cole's unlikely goal, Williams goal would've been the best of the night for me. 

Hope Shuey is ok."

4811,2020-09-01 12:34:11,ikjany,"Talk about limping to the finish line. Our accuracy (and Liam Ryan) absolutely saved us there.

The consecutive short breaks are starting to cook us and we've still got a couple more to go. We'll take the four points but the bulldogs and saints aren't going to let us get away with playing like that.

On the plus side Williams and O'Neill are both showing some great signs."

Daniher's shots on goal won us that game as much as our own did"
4813,2020-09-01 13:02:10,ikjany,"Simmo just said that Shuey is likely out for a couple of weeks. Really don‚Äôt think it was close enough to warrant putting him back out there. 

Petch and Kennedy likely available which is good."
4814,2020-09-01 13:03:34,ikjany,"Glad to have the win but it almost doesn't feel like a win. So many mistakes and a really clear lack of pressure. Can't tell if it's because of the quick turnaround of games or if we're only elite in Perth. With Yeo out, we need other to show a bit more hunger.

That said, there's a reason I've got this flair, what a performance from Ryan. Also liked the look of O'Neill and Williams, they seemed a lot more in control than last week."

4816,2020-09-01 12:37:58,ikjany,Average performance but great to get the 4 points. Hopefully Yeo coming back will lift our midfield
4817,2020-09-01 12:45:20,ikjany,"Bit of a worry that we have to back up and play on Sunday after that game. We looked cooked then and we have a massive tendency to lose our composure when that happens. Going to be a real tough game against the Bulldogs as they will try to run us off our feet. Some good signs from Williams and O'Neill but we need to think about our attack on the ball more. All well and good to have Gaff play a role where he is supposed to zone off and fill space but when we have Jetta doing the same thing it will just end up with other teams getting players to the ball and it will kill us. Hopefully they will fire up.

Also, i'm not sure if it's just me but have match threads been getting significantly worse this year? Seems like so much more bitching and moaning and less camaraderie between fans. The umpiring standard hasn't been great but fuck me it's not 10x worse than any other season."

4819,2020-09-01 14:51:31,ikjany,"Honestly, winning ugly gets us the same 4 points that winning pretty does, and with a shitload of injuries, consecutive 4-day breaks & living hub life, we‚Äôre just going to have to do what it takes to book the W‚Äôs in Queensland.    

Good effort to the boys, Liam Ryan is my spirit footballer."
4820,2020-09-01 13:05:18,ikjany,"Take the points. Essendon played a super high pressure, if ineffective, game and coming off two short breaks it could have really stung us if we weren't up for it in the first half.

I wish we had kept up the intensity in the second half but we did enough and that counts for something with these quick turnarounds.

Shuey coming back on was a mistake, as it looks like he's out for a couple of games now. Kennedy back next week will be very handy."

4852,2020-09-02 00:03:49,ikfnvk,"I know that, but I actually like this generational grouping. Makes all generations 18-19 years is very balanced, compared to making it very short as 15-16 or less years or making it very long like 21-22+ years. It makes things easier for everyone else instead of all this confusion. But at the same time, this is all arbitrary. I know that we are not really millennials at the end of the day, especially based on how society views millennials and such, but maybe being a millennial is different to another person. Just my two cents."

I mean it is very likely a three or four year old would not remember the political importance of these events. They may not even know who this Kennedy is until like years after he died. 1961 might have memories prior to Kennedy's death.  I am sure many 1959 and 1960 borns would not remember Kennedy's death. Many 1995-1998 dont even remember 9/11. 2015-2017 though can end up remembering a world before coronavirus 15 years from now, even though they may not know what coronavirus is.

4858,2020-09-01 08:09:10,ikfnvk,"I prefer the ranges next to: instead of this rather than its this. Makes no sense for 1960 to be gatekept from the other two early 60s years. You even said 1980 should be start of millennials since it is the first 80s year. First half of the 60s is gen jones anyways. 

I have seen 1945-1959 as a baby boomer definition. 

Then 1960-1979. 

1980-1999 is one of the most agreeable millennial definitions I have come across. It is my favorite actually.

I have seen 1998-2016. Never 1999-2017 though. People would prefer stating X in 1960 if 1964 or 1965 is too late, since the first three years of the 60s are the full early 60s years, just like how you said 1980 should be y as it is the first 80s year.

I have seen 1980-1998 (though I feel that most start Y in 1980 cause it is the first 80s year like ending it in 1994 or 1999 for the same numerical reason.

4867,2020-09-02 02:22:52,ikedts,Great Job Joe. I got a lot of work to keep firing back with content in the other league. lol Thoroughly enjoyed the read. Hard to get depth all around and I hope I have enough and can start of strong and adapt to the first couple of waiver weeks. Liking some early news from my two late LB picks.

Round 12 could've got better value at LB, or another WR. Course maybe Simmons does end up being a solid producer, I just wonder how long you'll have to wait on him before you can expect results."
4869,2020-09-02 10:55:05,ikedts,"You put together a solid team, it's definitely a young one. You grabbed 7 rookies, I think you really got good value on most of them. You put yourself in a nice situation you won't be dependent on all of them to hit but, if 3 or 4 of them do it should give you an edge."
4870,2020-09-01 03:41:36,ikcyag,I love this idea. Michael B Jordan would fill in and honor Chadwick in such a great way. The multiverse is open for business in phase 4 and I think Kevin Feige and the Marvel team could incorporate N‚ÄôJadaka as the black panther really well.
4871,2020-09-01 03:46:36,ikcyag,"Not a terrible idea, but it would basically be a recast and a passing of the mantle in a way.

Still, I'd rather see that or Shuri taking over. It's a weird situation where it's not as if Chadwick left the role or couldn't come to an agreement with Disney like Terrance Howard. It would be a shame to just recast and move on."
4872,2020-09-01 04:20:03,ikcyag,Michael B. Jordan as an alternate BP would be an excellent idea and would make for a hell of a premise: having the villain of the previous movie be the main character/hero would be something new for the MCU
4873,2020-09-01 09:48:03,ikcyag,"Yeah, maybe. Then there is the actor recast only, or Shuri.  

All that matters is that it makes sense in-universe. Couple of problems I see with Shuri, on top of what has happened in Wakanda during the Snap (has to have been a mess, politically speaking) are the Heart-Shaped Herb and M'Baku...  
  
Unless someone ""hid"" some away, there is no herb to give the Panther's abilities to anyone, let alone Shuri.   
  
Also, after M'Baku's speech at the first ritual combat in BP,  he made it quite clear his feeling on her, I'd imagine that extends to her taking up the mantle of Black Panther. And I can't imagine her being able to best him in ritual combat, without the Panther's abilities and given how close her brother came to losing to him.  
  
But if those can be satisfactorily explained in-universe, no problem."
4874,2020-09-01 04:55:25,ikcyag,"I still just want to see Shuri take up the mantle, it‚Äôs one of my favorite times in the Marvel Universe and how she handled Namor was exciting to see. A perfect storyline to adapt"
4875,2020-09-01 04:17:40,ikcyag,"Michael B Jordan and Chadwick Boseman played the same character on All My Children.  Just saying.

Edit - I want Shuri as Black Panther, for the record, but who would turn down having Jordan in the MCU some more?"
4876,2020-09-01 04:34:10,ikcyag,"Imo they should just recast the role of t'challa. Chadwick boseman from all the interviews I watched when he spoke on the character of black panther. He seemed to enjoy the impact his character and movie had on people especially the young kids. And I would like to think that he would want someone else to take a shot at playing the role of t'challa cause he knew just how much this character meant to people.

This might sound like an unpopular opinion but I definitely feel most people right now are just in their feelings. Which is very understandable chadwick seemed like an upstanding gentleman, and someone who truly cared for his profession. And its sad to see such a kind hearted soul go so early. But I definitely feel people are just acting off of their emotions when they say stuff like ""nobody else can play the role of t'challa like boseman did"" and ""recasting him would be disrespectful""."
4877,2020-09-01 05:53:32,ikcyag,"Just recast, t'challa has so much more story to tell. shuri being black Panther right now does not make sense for her character she is still a kid and I dont want to have them rush her character Arc. Imagine if Chris Evans died after winter soldier and they just said ""oh yea Steve died off screen bucky is captain America now""."
4878,2020-09-01 13:18:37,ikcyag,I think that depending on how the X-Men come into the MCU if it‚Äôs through the multiverse you could introduce a different actor playing him married to Storm. I don‚Äôt think retiring the character is the right choice though.
4879,2020-09-01 14:06:41,ikcyag,"I think using something as frivolous and comicbooky as the Multiverse to explain Boseman's absence is kind of in bad taste. The same if Boseman was killed off at the start of the movie.

Shuri is a tech genius, not a warrior. Plus, she's not a leading woman. It would be tough to market a movie with her as the lead

Either M'Baku or recast imo"
4880,2020-09-01 12:58:46,ikcyag,"Is kilmonger dead? Why don‚Äôt they just do some wakandan science on him, have wake up from a 7year coma, find out that his cousin is dead, and make him want to honor his fallen cousin?"
4881,2020-09-01 08:28:33,ikcyag,What about M‚ÄôBaku becoming the Black Panther?
4882,2020-09-01 09:12:49,ikcyag, So glad I'm not the only one who thought something like this could be possible
4883,2020-09-01 14:29:34,ikcyag,"This is a great idea and I‚Äôd like to see it happen, but we‚Äôd still need a Black Panther for the main MCUniverse. Realistically, Letitia Wright is probably gonna bulk up a bit to inherit role as Shuri."
4884,2020-09-01 15:32:00,ikcyag,"This is a great idea and I'd be very happy with it.  

But I think I'd rather see a recast.  It sucks so much, but I don't think the character should be concluded.  

I'd also be happy with Shuri, though I'm taking everyone's word on it that it was well-done in the books.  

It's the most unfortunate situation but I'll trust Feige handles it correctly, however they decide to do it."
4885,2020-09-01 17:42:01,ikcyag,Just recast the character and keep Chadwicks legacy going by writing good stories for the character. Throw in an Easter Egg to the OG Black Panther and keep it movin'.
4886,2020-09-01 18:05:53,ikcyag,Don't care how they do it. But yes do this.
4887,2020-09-01 18:13:35,ikcyag,"I think they should give an amazing and inspiring end to the actual Black Panther using deep fake technology. And then, pass the black panther costume to anybody else. I saw deep faced Leia in Rogue One youtube fx version and bloody hell, it was awesome."
4888,2020-09-01 18:26:18,ikcyag,"So I've thought about it a lot and I think recast is the only way. Black Panther has become an influence on kids on another level, Blade isn't really a superhero and Marvel never took the jump with a War Machine.

 There are a lot of black hero's that need some screen time but I say recast and keep Shuri as her current role. She isn't ready to take over the mantle or have a solo film yet. 

I'm sure Chadwick would be honored before the film starts. Black Panther will be like Spiderman or Batman. Multiple actors across different generations."
4889,2020-09-01 18:33:25,ikcyag,"Yeah, I'm sold."
4890,2020-09-01 19:19:53,ikcyag,In the Disney animation series Avengers his sister took over for him. He lost his crown and could not reclaim it so his sister claimed the crown for Wakanda
4891,2020-09-01 19:55:05,ikcyag,Won't they just cgi him into future movies?
4892,2020-09-01 21:46:35,ikcyag,"I know a lot of people do not want T'Challa to be recast but his character's story is not over. There are so many stories and tales left with that character. Walling off that role because Boseman was so good is a disservice to the character and all the people who look up to that character. T'Challa was just introduced, taking him away so soon isn't fair to the character and the legacy of Black Panther. People don't realize that eventually someone else was going to take on the role of T'Challa. The same way that Tony Stark will eventually come back but not as RDJ. Which is fine. These roles can be passed on."
4893,2020-09-01 23:32:38,ikcyag,"Eh im actually not a huge fan of this idea, mostly because it results in a major undermining if Kilminger's character and motivation. I think they should just do a ""next in line"" thing and use Shuri if the actress is up to it, or just use another cousin/aunt/uncle if she is not. Shuri was the Panther in the comics too for a while, even if she was older, plus having a young African woman headline a movie could break down even more barriers than the first film."
4894,2020-09-02 00:39:35,ikcyag,"I mean... sure, you could do that. But I don't feel it is necessary. What you're describing is in essence creating a whole new character to take the mantle, and then finding a convoluted way to cast a person who already notably played a different MCU character. I feel this only makes sense if you desperately feel Michael B Jordan just has to be the next BP.

I think Shuri taking the role would make far more sense. It fits with the movie universe that the BP title is passed around between individuals, it would have the basis of her being T'Challa's replacement in the comics and it'd be by a great actress who is liked by people as an actress along with her character being liked. And it'd be much easier to explain.

I think it'd be a good idea to forget production of 2 for a while, take time for everyone to process and honor the real person's life that was lost, then they could write in T'Challa's death offscreen, do the Shuri version of 2 and push back the release date to November 29, 2022, Chadwick's birthday. (since FFH already showed willingness to release on a Tuesday).

But obviously, I think those closest to Chadwick should have the say on whether they do this or any other idea."
4895,2020-09-02 00:40:09,ikcyag,"This is a nice idea and I'd love to see Killmonger return. 

But I do think that recasting Boseman's role is the right way to go. It's a huge ask of any actor to fill his shoes because Chadwick owned the role, but T'Challa's cultural relevance is just too important to retire him. 

It'll be difficult no matter how they go about it, and some people may disagree, but personally I think it's a sign of respect to recast. Chadwick seemed very aware of how influential T'Challa has been over the past few years. I don't doubt that Letitia Wright or Michael B. Jordan would do a wonderful job, but Shuri and Killmonger aren't T'Challa."
4896,2020-09-01 05:25:05,ikcyag,Shuri
4897,2020-09-01 12:58:51,ikcyag,More likely they will just replace the actor. It's what they did with War Machine.
4898,2020-09-01 16:17:45,ikcyag,"Stick with canon, his sister inherits the mantle."
4899,2020-09-02 02:27:00,ikcyag,"MBJ was the first person to come to mind when thinking about who could be T'Challa next. I don't even care that he was Killmonger... It's just my opinion but killing off T'Challa off screen is a real shitty way to honor Chadwick. Recast and continue what he started. Not that I know him, but I feel that's what he would want... The character is bigger than the actor... I have no problems with Shuri, but to end T'Challa's MCU journey so early is a mockery to the character he was in the comics, and to what he means to people now."
4900,2020-09-02 04:19:44,ikcyag,"I really don‚Äôt like the idea of just throwing the character away, even if done respectfully. I want to see more of T‚ÄôChalla. I feel like he has so much more story. We‚Äôll never see him interact with Storm if they retire him."
4901,2020-09-04 04:15:11,ikcyag,"This is going to be weird.

MCU is bringing in underworld characters like Blade, Ghost Rider and Mephisto. I would start Black Panther 2 with T'Challa is just gone. Wakanda is on a man hunt for him. Following rumors. They recruit Dr. Strange to help out explore the universe. Strange can't find him but gets a lead about a someone that can find lost souls.

Strange initially mistakes Ghost Rider for Red Skull but then discovers Ghost Rider is a different being. Ghost Rider has access to seek the underworld for lost souls. He finds Blade who has a lead on Mephisto who he caught leaving the underworld to kidnap souls. They need a soul close to T'Challa to find him. Shuri goes to the Panther Soul World to seek out the old Black Panthers for help. She intends to go to T'Chaka. She's shocked to find Killmonger! Killmonger was a legitimate king of Wakanda and a Black Panther so he's with the other souls of Panthers. Killmonger agrees to help. Blade, Ghost Rider, and Killmonger ride into the underworld which is a deeper level of the soul world to rescue T'Challa. Strange opens a portal to bridge them through but cannot join them but his cape wraps around Killmonger to join their journey.

They find Mephisto and before they can rescue T'Challa, Mephisto releases T'Challa's soul to be locked in hell. Killmonger is able to catch T'Challa's ethereal hand. Killmonger won't let T'Challa spend eternity in bondage. Killmonger destroys T'Challa lifeforce and T'Challa disappears and you see his spirit fly up into a heavenly portal that Strange's cape is able to open up by spinning like Strange's portal move. T'Challa's spirit is saved but he is no more.

The team has failed but were able to save T'Challa's soul. Killmonger returns to the old Panthers. Ghost Rider and Blade return to their underworld but they now have some new allies and connections with our world. Shuri takes the mantle of Black Panther and she looks rather high tech and a departure from the original Black Panther costumes."
4902,2020-09-01 14:30:31,ikcyag,What if they casted Terrance Howard to play BP
4903,2020-09-01 05:36:25,ikcyag,My hope for black panther 2 is that it starts with this great animated sequence like the first movie does but it‚Äôs about how t‚Äôchalla died defending his country (idk Im sure they‚Äôll think of a better way for him to go out than I can lol) and then it cuts to live action and it‚Äôs the funeral for t‚Äôchalla and every character shows up kind of like (tony starks funeral) and after it shows some of the characters talking to his family like maybe they can get Chris Evans back as old cap just for the funeral scene and can talk to shuri and could encourage her to take the mantle or whatever and they can put whatever villian they want in the movie I‚Äôm not sure how I would do the main plot of the movie so I‚Äôm not gonna write anything about that I‚Äôm sure they would do a better job than I could in that idea department but anyways in the end shuri beats whatever bad guy and it‚Äôs a happy ending maybe the final scene can be shuri going to t‚Äôchallas grave and the final line of the movie can be ‚ÄúI hope I did good enough brother‚Äù or something and then the post credit scene can be a cut to a different universe in the multiverse where it shows the son of t‚Äôchalla and Nakia (in this alternate universe they had a son when they first started dating) and he‚Äôs maybe around 10-13 years old and it shows him getting thrown into the main mcu universe and black panther 3 can be about shuri raising t‚Äôchalla junior and showing him how to be the black panther. Idk just an idea in my head lol I hope nobody takes this as disrespectful or anything because I really mean none but needless to say rip Chadwick and I hope marvel makes more good movies about this character so we can honor and love what he started and keep the black panther love going
4904,2020-09-01 11:13:58,ikcyag,"They have options

If they were to recast Tchalla (least likely) they have John Boyega, John David Washington and the person I originally had in mind for Blade before Ali, Ylan Noel from Insecure and the Purge prequel

They can go with Shuri but the question is if Letitia Wright is up for the stress but they could play as basically the queen and new ""ironman""

Bringing back Killmonger is a really interesting direction they could take it, give him a redemption arc via the new villain



My original idea for Black Panther 2 before Chadwick's passing could be easily be modified to account for Killmongers redemption arc 

The idea was Achebe using the events of End Game of to spread conspiracies among the new people being aware of Wakanda especially those on the contintent and Erik seeing the error of his ways and how Achebe is a darker version of himself and can try to live up to tchallas example.

It was originally meant to be the MCU's Dark Knight with Achebe's whole MO being a matter of fear and mistrust through psy ops turning everyone against the Wakandan Elite via conspiracy theories"
4905,2020-09-01 17:09:04,ikcyag,"I don't need to read all that to know that's a terrible idea. Chadwick was so great from aesthetics wise because he was dark skinned. Typical white kid move to juggle one black actor for one that's on the top of your mind. There are so many great black actors that haven't gotten their chance, and you wanna pull the Michael B Jordan/Idris Elba derivative move"
4906,2020-09-01 04:07:22,ikcyag,I heard he had a gf so a son pass off be best
4907,2020-09-01 03:49:01,ikcyag,"Yeah as neat of an idea that is, it‚Äôs reworking a lot of the MCU. Having Shuri take on the mantle is easily the easiest step. Plus Shuri made a badass black panther and Is a great character overall. I‚Äôd love to see her BP suit."
4908,2020-09-01 04:18:59,ikcyag,"I feel like they would need to explain how/why Shuri took over as BP. Short of some amazing and tasteful face recreation CGI, I'm not sure it'd be a convincing passing of the torch otherwise."
4909,2020-09-04 08:55:55,ikcyag,Nah IT shouldn't be shuri
4910,2020-09-01 06:40:06,ikcyag,He would also have to go through the whole arc of proving himself that he‚Äôs not evil and prove himself as a hero.
4911,2020-09-01 10:26:18,ikcyag,You're suggesting that the MCU goes the same route as the Terminator franchise?
4912,2020-09-01 23:35:47,ikcyag,"Eh, I wouldn't mind seeing a Killmonger that DID kill TChalla and the results of his actions therein. Maybe how he's actually a pretty well liked ruler. But I dont want a ""good guy"" kill monger from a happy home- it fully defeats the purpose of his character."
4913,2020-09-01 12:16:41,ikcyag,"I still find it hard to believe, even before all of this that there isn't a herb remaining somewhere."
4914,2020-09-01 23:37:30,ikcyag,"Eh the heart shape herb can be handwaved if they want, but i think a story about a young capable woman claiming a mantle that she is fully able to fulfill despite major detractors could be an interesting story itself"
4915,2020-09-01 14:46:04,ikcyag,"Unpopular opinion, but I would pass on more Michael B. personally"
4916,2020-09-01 12:21:04,ikcyag,I do 100% think Chadwick took the responsibility of the role and understood the impact of T'challa on the world after that movie. And because of that he would certainly not want that character and importance to dissappear with him. He like many of us know how important Black Panther was to our current world culture.
4917,2020-09-02 00:55:14,ikcyag,"I just think Shuri provides a very classy way to do it easily, and true to the source material, so why do something that might potentially offend a significant amount of people?"
4918,2020-09-02 04:14:53,ikcyag,That Captain America comparison is a good comparison I hadn‚Äôt thought of.
4919,2020-09-01 16:05:48,ikcyag,"> does not make sense for her character she is still a kid 

well by the time BP2 comes out it will have been 4 years since BP1, shell be like 28 or 29 when BP2 films, that's a lot older than the 24 year old actress she was when BP1 filmed, people grow up a lot in their mid 20s ESPECIALLY when thrust into being a queen and superhero, which could all be shown in BP2, like it could be a coming of age type story of how the new queen who never expected to rule, deals with an invasion of her country."
4920,2020-09-01 23:29:49,ikcyag,That ending was so powerful it would be a disservice to the story to have him survive.
4921,2020-09-01 19:03:37,ikcyag,We don't know if he's truly dead. So I'm hoping they decided to keep him alive via Wakandan science as well.
4922,2020-09-02 04:15:32,ikcyag,Kinda would ruin T‚Äôchalla‚Äôs whole arc throughout the movie if he was still alive.
4923,2020-09-01 10:41:36,ikcyag,"That wouldn‚Äôt work since technically, he‚Äôs supposed to be ‚ÄúMan-Ape‚Äù who was originally a villain in the comics until the MCU flipped that. But anything is possible, I guess."
4924,2020-09-02 01:12:48,ikcyag,"Michael B Jordan and Chadwick Bosemans BP would both cease to exist at the end of this story. The mantle would then be passed to someone else. 

The intent behind this idea was to send off Chad‚Äôs T‚ÄôChalla with an honorable sacrifice and not just killed off screen, although the audience would expect that, knowing the other BP (our BP) would be sacrificed when the other multiverse BP (MBJ) decides to make the sacrifice. The audience would be like, oh, that‚Äôs how they will end his character, but then at the end we see that both BP‚Äôs were on the same mission and both decided to make the sacrifice, from both sides of the rift. 

I think the character arc of MBJ discovering the earth he has found himself in, the people he encounters, know him as a bad guy and he needs to restore honor to his name. 

I think the actor MBJ would make the performance very personal as he was good friends with Chad in real life. 

It just fits in a way that no other concept does in my mind."
4925,2020-09-01 16:07:27,ikcyag,"a lot of people consider that to be disrespectful to his memory, something they didn't have to worry about in the war machine situation."
4926,2020-09-02 04:31:20,ikcyag,"Hmm. Yeah I understand that. 

Well, here‚Äôs a re-write. 

Instead of both versions being consumed by the singularity, all we know for sure is that whomever reaches into it surely cannot survive it. 

MBJ‚Äôs BP takes the plunge and decides to sacrifice himself. 

As he reaches in, he sees Chad‚Äôs BP. T‚ÄôChalla gives him the Wakanda salute, smiles, and claims the sacrifice for himself. 
The singularity closes and instead of returning home, MBJ remains as he cannot swap with someone who is no longer there. 

His sacrifice is that he loses everyone and everything he loves. He can‚Äôt return home. 
He takes up the mantle of our BP, but his arc continues and begins to wobble over the course of more films. The audience is lead to believe that he has the capacity to turn bad in his pursuits to return to his world. 

He eventually discovers a way, and is contemplating what he must do to achieve this goal, and it is around that time when he meets Storm. 

All kinda of drama can unfold from there."
4927,2020-09-04 05:21:43,ikcyag,"> This is going to be weird.


Yup"
4928,2020-09-01 04:08:17,ikcyag,Yes. I would love to have Shuri as Black Panther.
4929,2020-09-01 04:14:11,ikcyag,"Well it would be one, maybe two movies. Or a single series run on Disney plus. It all comes undone and black panther is retired or then the mantle is passed to Shuri as many others (including myself) would like to see eventually."
4930,2020-09-01 16:00:24,ikcyag,"especially with Iron Man gone, she could fill the IM role of the Avengers, especially if there's no way for her to take the herb, since it was all destroyed. BP didn't really fit into the avengers while IM and Cap were there as he basically filled both roles, whereas Shuri only needs to fill the IM role and we can have Sam or Bucky fill the Cap role."
4931,2020-09-01 06:28:06,ikcyag,She's really not great in that movie just saying.
4932,2020-09-01 13:25:07,ikcyag,"Don't know why you're being downvoted. Yes, Shuri took over in the comics temporarily. They also explained why. It wasn't like suddenly next issue she was BP. In order to explain this in a movie, you're going to have to explain what happened to T'Challa, which will likely involve some CGI to be convincing."
4933,2020-09-01 12:05:45,ikcyag,She's next in line for the throne. The role falls to her naturally. They'd almost have to explain why she *didn't* become black panther
4934,2020-09-01 17:08:38,ikcyag,"In my head, we don‚Äôt even see T‚Äôchalla‚Äôs face until the climax, inside the singularity, which would be full of digital effects. They could use any footage of him smiling for this."
4935,2020-09-01 04:28:50,ikcyag,She did in the comics.
4936,2020-09-01 08:02:39,ikcyag,Also why would the black panther of a different universe be willing to leave their world.
4937,2020-09-01 23:56:27,ikcyag,"Eh, I think having that Killmonger be one that killed T'Challa would put a bad taste in audience's mouths. It would make for an interesting story, but considering how close Chadwick's portrayal hit home for many it would feel weird to follow the story of a character who killed his character"
4938,2020-09-01 12:20:31,ikcyag,"You'd hope. Though, Wakandians seem very serious about rituals, and I don't see anyone who would have stolen some herb, unless it was Zuri (who is dead), very forthcoming with the sharing... But like I said, as long as it makes sense."
4939,2020-09-01 16:22:15,ikcyag,"Agreed. I know some people who have spent time with him in real life, and after hearing their stories I can‚Äôt really enjoy watching him anymore. He‚Äôs not exactly a good guy, especially around women."
4940,2020-09-02 21:24:38,ikcyag,"""so why do something that might potentially offend a significant amount of people?""

Thats the thing I don't think it will really offend people 2 years from now. People RIGHT NOW are upset and sad about what happened to chadwick. Right now in alot of peoples minds anybody else playing the role of t'challa is just not a viable option. Cause right now people are in their feelings which is very understandable. To some people the death of chadwick felt like a family member or a friend dying. 

But I think 2 years from now people are still gonna be sad about what happened to chadwick. But I think people are gonna be more open to a recast. Especially if marvel and who ever they choose if they decide to recast are respectful of the legacy that chadwick boseman left behind. And have some kinda tribute to chadwick boseman in the black panther sequel. I think people would be fine with it. Especially if they choose someone who does just as good a job as chadwick did in the role."
4941,2020-09-02 01:18:18,ikcyag,"But wouldn't you need a CGI Chadwick to have it not off screen? And in that case, why not just do a CGI Chadwick?"
4942,2020-09-01 16:11:02,ikcyag,"Well that's dumb. ""The show must go on"". That's how it has always worked."
4943,2020-09-01 07:24:21,ikcyag,no one asked dude
4944,2020-09-02 00:52:57,ikcyag,I feel like they could write that he died from natural causes offscreen. It could send a powerful message that even superheroes face the same day to day challenges ordinary people do.
4945,2020-09-01 17:01:58,ikcyag,I'm talking about them explaining what happened to T'Challa in a satisfying manner (from a storytelling perspective and for the audience's emotional closure).
4946,2020-09-01 17:11:49,ikcyag,"The calamity itself would uproot these characters. Alternate Dr. Strange, alternate Ant-Man, alternate  spider-man, etc...

They wouldn‚Äôt choose to be there, hence their mission to restore the multiverses."
4947,2020-09-01 12:23:33,ikcyag,"I think it's more likely through some shenanigans the original Killmonger never actually died. Something from the herb, or someone took his body and did something to it. It's not like we didn't see Bucky ""die"" just to live."
4948,2020-09-02 00:15:14,ikcyag,"Oh i wasnt say to have him as a protagonist, just a character"
4949,2020-09-01 16:06:22,ikcyag,"Shuri is probably smart enough to synthesise the herb.

Edit: or create nanomachines for her blood to give her similar skills, probably healing factor, and instant-suit."
4950,2020-09-01 19:48:03,ikcyag,You‚Äôre gonna have to provide better sources then; Dude trust me.
4951,2020-09-03 01:03:24,ikcyag,I guess we'll see.
4952,2020-09-02 01:48:16,ikcyag,"No. The one scene with his face would use real footage from any number of clips with CG elements to add the uniform and singularity effects. 

The entire story would play out on our earth, not knowing anything about what is happening in the other universe. We would be seeing only what the characters on-screen would be experiencing. Blind to the events occurring with our versions of the avengers who were replaced. 

They could do a few introduction, wake-up moments for our guys in the other world, but I‚Äôm imagining them to unfold in sort of a montage:

A singularity event occurs, major destruction in an isolated area where the avengers are battling a currently undecided threat. Due to the nature the threat, they are suited up in quantum realm suits like those in endgame. Once it passes, as they take a head-count/look for survivors/etc,  they realize something is off, they retreat to a safe area and as they remove their suits it is revealed that many of them have been switched. The two universes aren‚Äôt vastly different, some heroes are embodied by the same genetic person (as their opposite also happened to be the bearer of the mantle they carry)

The reveal of MBJ as Black Panther would be the worrisome swap, as Shuri is among them and knows him as Killmonger. Immediate distrust, she thinks he has a hand in the events that caused the singularity."
4953,2020-09-01 16:16:06,ikcyag,"people want the show to go on, that's the whole point of discussing ways to let the show go on, but *also* be respectful to his memory.

Fast and Furious wrote Paul Walker out of the franchise rather than recast, and that was considered the respectful thing to do.

Howard was only a supporting character in 1 movie before being recast, right at the beginning of the franchise, and was frankly replaced with a better actor, Boseman was the lead in 1 MCU movie and a supporting character in 3 quite a long way in, it's a lot harder to get people on board a recast at that point, especially when Boseman was so beloved in the role."
4954,2020-09-01 07:43:05,ikcyag,Dude she's not that good of a character. Coogler will have to some major reworking of her character to make her a good lead.
4955,2020-09-02 00:53:30,ikcyag,Do you really think the audience won't understand if they have to make his death offscreen?
4956,2020-09-02 00:19:37,ikcyag,Ah ok gotcha
4957,2020-09-02 01:51:44,ikcyag,"Ok, I'm sorry, but I'm a giant comic nerd whose seen a lot of way out sci-fi stuff and you've lost me. I really doubt it would make sense to the general audience."
4958,2020-09-01 20:25:20,ikcyag,"And they didn‚Äôt even have to do that, since they had his twin brother still."
4959,2020-09-01 16:19:05,ikcyag,"Yeah but it is unavoidable. It's more ""disrespectful"" to recast a person who can still do the role don't you think?"
4960,2020-09-01 08:04:33,ikcyag,"But did anyone asked on opinions on Shuri? Why is your first reaction on seeing people enjoying a character ""yeah I should tell them that she's not good""?"
4961,2020-09-02 03:58:14,ikcyag,You think it would be tasteful to just kill off the character offscreen?
4962,2020-09-02 02:08:36,ikcyag,"Avengers assemble to face a threat. It‚Äôs deemed to be a world ending one. Really bad. 
They need to wear quantum realm suits for protection. 

They can‚Äôt stop event. 

As the dust settles, there is confusion when they are cleaning up. They leave the immediate area and as they are debriefing on a transport ship, their masks come off and one by one they discover some of the Avengers aren‚Äôt who they recognize. The last one to unmask is BP, and it‚Äôs Killmonger. 

Opening credits. 

They discover that two versions of earth had many people swap places, but the singularity isn‚Äôt over, time is short. They need to fix this. 
Killmonger isn‚Äôt Killmonger, he‚Äôs the black panther on his world and we cut to him telling the team what happened to his cousin on his world (he‚Äôs deceased) 
MBJ‚Äôs black panther feels alone, unaccepted due to the nature of them knowing him as a villain. They don‚Äôt trust him. 

He wins them over eventually and when they discover that the only way to undo the swap is by someone physically entering the singularity (due to something breaking/being sabotaged/etc) there is hesitance by the team. They realize that the sacrifice would destroy both versions of the hero in each universe. Some are the same person, some are different people. It has nothjng to do with DNA, and everything to do with something that is inside of them. The singularity was a weapon targeted to key in on the ‚Äújuice‚Äù that makes the hero special. Whether it was a spider bite, or a heart shaped herb, an overload of gamma radiation, whatever it may be, it was targeted. 

Some of the Avengers struggle with the idea of making the sacrifice that is needed, since it wouldn‚Äôt just be sacrificing themselves, but also the other version who, for some, is an entirely different person. 

MBJ does not waver. He knows his cousin, and knows he would sacrifice himself in this scenario, so he creates a situation where it‚Äôs him and no one else (a friendly duel not unlike Black widow and Hawkeye)

When he wins, and reaches into the singularity to close it, he is greeted by Chad‚Äôs BP doing the exact same thing. The avengers on the other world were on the same mission, and BP‚Äôs on both sides chose to sacrifice themselves for the same reason. 

We see Chad smile, maybe they find a good clip of him saying something and re-use that too, but yeah that‚Äôs it. 

I didn‚Äôt think it was that convoluted and it‚Äôs very comic-booky for sure, but that‚Äôs what makes it so fantastical."
4963,2020-09-01 16:21:36,ikcyag,">It's more ""disrespectful"" to recast a person who can still do the role don't you think?

Possibly, but Howard caused himself to be recast by being greedy, so he deserves disrespect. Dead people *typically* don't deserve disrespect."

4966,2020-09-02 02:52:25,ikcyag,"I see it a bit more now, still think it's a little convoluted for the non comic book fan audience, but I give you credit for coming up with it nonetheless."

5018,2020-10-06 09:32:13,j61xel,"It's not really a biopic because he's part of an ensemble, but there's a film coming out this fall that has Cooke as a character! It's called [One Night in Miami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Night_in_Miami_(film)) and it's a fictionalized story of Cooke, Malcolm X, Jim Brown and Muhammad Ali basically talking in a hotel room one night. It's Regina King's directorial debut and stars Leslie Odom Jr (of Hamilton fame) as Cooke.   


It's received excellent reviews and looks really interesting!"
5019,2020-10-06 09:22:22,j61xel,"To be honest, the circumstances weren't ""questionable"".   


Sam picked up a hooker at a party. Sam took this hooker to her worksite---a seedy motel. Sam accused the hooker of stealing from him(never leave a hooker and your wallet in the same room). Sam flipped out, threw the hooker a beating, chased her to a phone booth, then chased her to the motel office, where he went nuts and ended up getting shot by the motel clerk---who was likely the bag lady for whichever pimp ran the girls.   


When you get shot while naked except for one shoe and a sportcoat, and your companion is a prostitute, it's not exactly complicated to figure out what happened.   


Sam was a massively talented guy who had demons."
5020,2020-10-06 10:50:58,j61xel,">it's a fictionalized story of Cooke, Malcolm X, Jim Brown and Muhammad Ali basically talking in a hotel room one night.

Then, it turns into a Hangover type night of merry mishaps between 4 black dudes in the south in the 60s. /s if it wasn't apparent."
5021,2020-10-06 09:32:56,j61xel,"That's the official story. [It's not nearly that simple.](https://chicagocrusader.com/what-really-happened-to-sam-cooke/) There are plenty of credible questions about what really happened that night.

And even if it happened just as you describe, that's plenty of material to base a very good biopic on."
5022,2020-10-06 09:39:31,j61xel,"I watched ""The Two Killings of Sam Cooke"". There's no conspiracy. Etta James said his injuries were too severe to have happened just at the hands of the motel manager, but that's totally impossible to verify. She looked like a tough old broad, and if she was managing a seedy hooker motel, it's totally plausible she did kick his ass. Especially if he was drunk. 

The Sam Cooke story doesn't make a good movie if it's told with the facts we have. ""Millionaire singer attacks two women and dies naked except for a sportcoat"" doesn't put smiles on people's faces."
5023,2020-10-06 09:48:36,j61xel,"Sorry, I forgot that all movies need happy endings."
5024,2020-10-06 10:12:52,j61xel,"If you want to put butts in seats, yeah. 

Making a movie about Sam Cooke and doing it according to the facts doesn't do Sam Cooke any good. It's not the story of a tragic rock star who dies of an overdose. No, it's a story of a millionaire who got himself shot because he got drunk, hired a hooker, and then attacked two women. 

Dying with your dick out because you got shot and your ass whipped by a madam isn't a way anyone needs to be remembered."
5025,2020-10-06 10:54:20,j61xel,Weird comment.
5026,2020-10-06 11:00:23,j61xel,"No---factual comment. Sam Cooke died wearing a sport coat and one shoe. He was drunk off his ass and assaulting women, and got his ass whipped and shot to death by a bag lady in a seedy motel. 

What's weird about the truth?"
5027,2020-10-06 11:04:22,j61xel,"Well, you don‚Äôt know the full truth because nobody does. That‚Äôs not the weird part. The weird part is you detail how insane and fucked up his life and death were... and then deny it would make for a compelling film."
5028,2020-10-06 11:10:33,j61xel,"Nobody wants to see the legacy of Sam Cooke ruined by a truthful biopic. 

Right now I'd wager most people, if they even know who Sam Cooke is, think he died in a plane crash. 

The Cooke family won't let an honest portrayal be made, and a dishonest one that implicates his manager and the LAPD or whatever is just going to inflame people. 

Let sleeping dogs lie."

5035,2020-10-05 08:13:47,j58ah2,"Appreciate you compiling this list bi-weekly. It seems pretty comprehensive but I thought I'd mention a few additional names that might merit tracking. I'm not exactly sure what criteria you're using for inclusion.

[Nico Olsak](https://www.transfermarkt.us/nicolas-olsak/profil/spieler/422158) | CDM RCK Waalwijk

 He is married to an American woman after spending most of his youth in Florida and playing college soccer at Belmont. If he's not already USMNT eligible he will be soon. 

[Jose Veizaga](https://www.transfermarkt.us/jose-veizaga/profil/spieler/742608) | CDM Club Blooming

He played college soccer first in Missouri and then at Seton Hall. Appears he was born in Bolivia. Not sure if he's actually eligible.

Some other players that have US eligibility (not just green card related) in Football Manager that I haven't really seen confirmation of anywhere else: 

[Leonardo Campana](https://www.transfermarkt.us/leonardo-campana/profil/spieler/606872) | ST Famalicao

[Josh Emmanuel](https://www.transfermarkt.us/josh-emmanuel/profil/spieler/386263) | RB Hull City 

[Jonathan Bond](https://www.transfermarkt.us/jonathan-bond/profil/spieler/130768) | GK West Brom 

[Damon Bansais](https://www.transfermarkt.us/damon-bansais/profil/spieler/469662) | RB Pau FC 

[Jonathan Morsay](https://www.transfermarkt.us/jonathan-morsay/profil/spieler/298313) | LW Chievo Verona"

5037,2020-10-05 02:09:16,j58ah2,Great weekend even without a Christian Pulisic goal
5038,2020-10-05 01:02:21,j58ah2,"They played on Friday, so I Included him on the [weekday](https://www.reddit.com/r/ussoccer/comments/j45xw0/americans_playing_abroad_today_92810220/) Summary"
5039,2020-10-05 02:08:44,j58ah2,"This year. It was a spot start at first, but he‚Äôs been there more than CM. He likes to Mix things up"
5040,2020-10-05 15:14:38,j58ah2,"I believe the criteria is that they need to have played in a senior level match this weekend. So from your list Campana, Emmanuel, Bansias & Moreau qualify. However Campana is cap tied to Ecuador and I can‚Äôt find anything on the other three having US connections. Can you expand on their US eligibility?"
5041,2020-10-05 17:07:33,j58ah2,Yeah I went through transfermarkt and found the guys who have US citizenship but none of these guys appeared. FM did have some issues with eligibility though like that one time the Bolovian FA reached out to a guy they saw was eligible on FM in France or something and they he said he didn't have any Bolivian ancestry
5042,2020-10-05 16:12:04,j58ah2,"Football Manager is a comprehensive video game that basically lets you build lineups and manage all aspects of soccer teams. Sometimes the databases in the game are actually more up to date than information widely available on wikipedia, transfermarkt, etc. There is an option in the game to search by the criteria ""partially"" American. All the names in the list popped up as a result of that search. If you do that search, it includes some players already cap-tied to other nations with ties to America like Thomas Delaney, Funes Mori brothers, Subotic, etc. as well as some players who have US green cards (as part of the domestic player mechanic for MLS) like Josef Martinez for example. As far as I could tell, none of the above fit either criteria.  


The only clear ties to the US I found in my quick search were provided for the players above. Leonardo Campana's grandfather clearly had strong business ties in the US where he died [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis\_Noboa\_Naranjo](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Noboa_Naranjo) but I didn't see anything specific to Leonardo.  As you mentioned he has four caps for Ecuador, I wasn't sure whether he was permanently tied and it seems extremely unlikely that he would play elsewhere since his father is Minister of Commerce but he's clearly a talent and thought some folks might be interested to know what might have been.

As for the others, I was unable to find anything tying them to the US, but I was kinda hoping if we started to highlight them and their potential eligibility that maybe someone with connections could dig up the information. I do know that players that I originally thought were perhaps miscategorized by Football Manager e.g. [Caio Canedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caio_Canedo_Corr%C3%AAa) later turned out to have clear ties to the US."
5043,2020-10-05 18:39:25,j58ah2,"Absolutely. For all the time they spent in the US including at FC Dallas Academy, I do not think we know for certain that the Funes Mori brothers ever had US citizenship / eligibility. I would say the same thing about Caio Candeo. The FM Database is compiled with input from scouts, clubs, etc. so they have some proprietary information but there's always the possibility for entry errors with a database that size. I think in the case of the players I mentioned, though, the fact that they didn't spend any time in the USA points to the strong possibility that they may have American bloodlines through one or more parents. Jonathan Morsay in particular has a good deal of social media posts in English and his profile pic is of USA gold medal winning Olympian Tommie Smith, but he only has the Sierra Leone and Swedish flags in his profile. Given some of the names you include (Bradley Johnson for example) that have been definitively proven to be ineligible, I thought you might be using the list to track anyone with ties to America (seems worthwhile to me) versus only guys that are still USMNT eligible and in contention for a call-up. Someone that has a login should cross-post these guys to the detective thread on Big Soccer Yanks Abroad or tweet at Brian Sciaretta, and maybe we could get more definitive information."

William, Ann and 12 year old daughter Patricia were found brutally murdered in their home in the rural farming community of Milan, Ohio. Their son, Michael (16 yr old?), came home from work and found them. He was cleared and has not been a suspect or POI since. Some neighbors had their doubts about him, but overall most people from the area did/do not suspect him. There was speculation of a possible drifter passing through on a nearby railway, among other rumors. This happened less than 1/4 mile down the road from where I live.

There was a book left at the scene, ‚ÄòIn Cold Blood‚Äò by Truman Capote, which eerily was a story about the *almost* exact same crime.

5181,2021-02-06 14:54:02,j242ym,"Where did you conduct your research? It's well-established and documented that Montezuma was killed when Cort√©s brought him to a rooftop to address his peoole, who were revolting, and he died 3 days later from presumed head trauma (his people continued their assult of stones, spears, arrows, etc.). 

The Aztec had enough by this point and we're no longer loyal to their ruler. Montezuma had litterally welcomed Cotr√©s and his men into his place personally, giving them the most honored welcome because Cort√©s was rumored to resemble their god Quetzalcoatl, who was prophesied to return. Montezuma, supposedly blinded by this prophecy, was almost immediately arrested by Cort√©s and consequently held hostage, which allowed the Spanish to establish a foothold in the city. This disgusted the Aztec, who were firece, accomplished warriors and conquerors themselves. They lost respect and loyalty for their ruler. At one point, Cort√©s had to leave Tenochtitlan to address a convoy lead by Narvaez and left the city in the hands of Person de Alvarado, who then led an absolutely brutal attack against the Aztec's during a religious ceremony.  

When Cort√©s returned, the Aztec were in full revolt against the remaining Spanish, but allowed Cort√©s and his men entrance into the city and then pushed them into an area where their horses and superior weapons would be at a disadvantage. In a last-ditch attempt, Cort√©s bought out Montezuma to quiet his people. It didn't work. 

I could go on and on, but there's really no mystery behind Montezuma's death; He was hit in the head during a huge uprising/revolt and died days later from the wound. 

""Exploitation, Inequality, and Resistance: A History of Latin America Since Columbus""  --- added this as a supportive source I could remember off the top of my head. 

If you have the research you did that claims Montezuma's cause of death is unknown, I'd love to see it!! I've been examining the fall of Tenochtitlan for a while and this would surprise me."

5219,2020-09-29 21:34:46,j242ym,"And the 1930‚Äôs murder of Lilly Lindestr√∂m (alt the time known as the Atlas murder, in recent years known as the vampire murder) most likely isn‚Äôt very extraordinary. She was a woman in prostitution, she took ‚Äúin-calls‚Äù in her apartment. She was found naked with her head crushed by three blows. The scene had been cleaned up. She was found four days after she had last been seen and her neighbour and friend had heard her phone ringing in the apartment without being picked up all that time. 
The reason this case is famous is that a soup ladle was found with brown stains on it, and it was theorised that the killer had used it to drink her blood. However, it wasn‚Äôt found in her apartment, but outside on the sidewalk. It‚Äôs also not heavy enough to have been the murder weapon. In the building or the next building was a restaurant, so it‚Äôs more likely that it came from there. It‚Äôs a sad case, but there‚Äôs no proof that there was any vampirism or cannibalism involved. If it had happened today they would probably have solved it with DNA. There was a used condom found on or near the body, most likely from the killer."

Someone wanted something he had.  His belongings did appear to be of higher quality, perhaps he was targeted for them. 

He was an asshole.

It was revenge. 

Someone thought he was an animal due to poor visibility, like if it were snowing heavily.  Can‚Äôt imagine food being readily available so a brown furry animal could look like a potential feast.

Edit: changed ice age to Bronze Age."
5229,2020-09-29 22:32:55,j242ym,"It's honestly surprising that they haven't found him. Libby gave us as much as she could; video, picture, words, voice. There are a lot of rumors about who it could be, but nothing really solid. I hate that he got away with it so far. I believe it was not his first, and wont be his last, killing. We need to get this guy behind bars."

5231,2020-09-30 10:19:16,j242ym,"I've never heard that theory. What have you read about it? Did he supposedly show up and randomly target her? I tend to think it was an ""accident."" She walked around with a few different guys that night. I think either someone got upset at something and killed her, she ODed and they didn't know what to do, or she got hurt and they left her to die. Then her ""friends"" got rid of her body. Makes me sick any way you say it. I wish they would at least leave a note or something to tell her family where her body is 

I went to school with Jill Behrman. She used to party with us on my dorm floor. It was such a shock to me when she was missing. Her parents are good people. It was a sad story, but I'm glad they got closure, and eventually, justice. It did take a few years, though. That's why I think I follow this story and am hopeful for Lauren's family. Same campus, much different stories, but still scary without an answer.

I am dreading some cg abomination zombie thing. There is no good in passing off to Suri due to this real life tragedy.  


I think the call to kill/end T'Challa as BP because of the situation is the worst possible future for BP. So much for being one of the big ones like Bats or Spidey."
5294,2020-10-12 22:15:45,iy2sf9,Im not a fan of this idea. Not saying that thought wasnt put into it but it would be far easier and less complicated to just have a Black Panther come from another universe and introduce him in Dr Strange 2 and just have that be the move

I love the Black Panther comics and having a male lead as the character is important to develop a certain relationship with one of the X-Men (Storm) when they are eventually introduced which is why I'm not crazy about the Shuri take over. Letitia is great and could/should eventually be Black Panther but there is a whole lot of character arc to cover before we get there.

Shuri should eventually be the Black Panther, just not yet too much of the original story gets skipped imo if they do that now."

5324,2020-09-21 20:05:00,ix6ivr,"I think it would have to be animated since live action would need a crazy CGI budget for all the nonhuman characters.

For voices, I'm thinking

The Rock as Relc since he has similar energy to Maui

Sir Patrick Stewart as Niers - military leader with a sense of humor

Kristen Bell as Erin - Comedy + seriousness when necessary and she can sing

Sean Bean as Raelt - good king and always in danger of dying

Mark Hamill as Tom for obvious reasons"
5325,2020-09-22 03:57:56,ix6ivr,Danny De Vito as Niers
5326,2020-09-21 20:27:27,ix6ivr,"Not necesarily. You can do a lot with make up these days. Like, practical effects make up, latex and stuff. It looks better than CGI too. Tho an animated twi would be great too!I would love if it was animated by the same people that did spiderman and the spiderverse because it looks great

I love your picks. Sean Bean do would be a perfect Raelt"
5327,2020-09-22 04:31:02,ix6ivr,I love this so much xDDDDD
5328,2020-09-22 19:41:20,ix6ivr,Next to no special effects needed
5329,2020-09-21 23:18:24,ix6ivr,"The problem is the faces. Large prosthetics like those you'd need for Gnolls and Drakes get in the way of acting since they don't usually translate facial expressions properly. 

Even if all the makeup and stuff was perfect, you'd also have to set up complicated perspective tricks for stuff like Rags, Erin, and Moore interacting since there are three distinct scales of humanoid in a single scene. All the extra costs would cause a studio to cut a bunch of characters and we'd end up with a mediocre adaptation. In animation, all the characters cost the same to use, so the whole thing could be adapted properly. 

And that's not even mentioning the monsters and giant CGI battles that come up occasionally. There's no way the Wyvern fight could be made in live action with anything less than a Game of Thrones level budget. There's a reason the Witcher show doesn't show that many monsters. They're just hard to make look good.

Finally, the more animalistic characters would be hard to make sympathetic in live action since they'd look pretty threatening without really careful character design. In animation, you can have characters look like anything without triggering primal fears of predators.

Tldr: TWI has a lot of stuff that would be really expensive to put in live action even if you could make the characters look good, which would be hard even with modern makeup and prosthetics."

Mating Rituals - the movie"
5331,2020-09-22 01:21:15,ix6ivr,"Ohhhhh yeah, is a good argument there. I see your point. Most of my picks would work for voice acting anyway. Or could have the characters drawn to be similar to them. An animated series would be great"
5332,2020-09-19 06:59:22,ivnkjc,I would like Snelling to get elevated. I think he has shown enough grit to warrant a go
5333,2020-09-19 07:12:18,ivnkjc,"These are the players in the last year of their contract:

Adam Saad	‚úÖ

Some of these player have already retired but a lot of them have been on the list for a while and not really showed anything to keep them in the team.

The big one I think people will disagree with is Gleeson, while I don't think he is best 22 at the moment he can come in and play a role."
5334,2020-09-19 07:03:17,ivnkjc,Looks like McKernan retired

Hooker if Francis stays and we can get a 2nd for him (unlikely)

&#x200B;

Targets:

If Saad and Daniher goes we'll probably have pick 5, 6 and 10(ish)

~~Target Zac Williams through free agency --> direct Saad replacement~~ (EDIT: adjusts our FA for Daniher, would rather the top 6-8 pick)

Target Ben Brown (2nd rounder)

Target Peter Wright and Will Broadie (pick 10 with a future 2nd or 3rd back?)

Draft - Pick 5: best inside mid available

Draft - Pick 6: Finlay Macrae, apparently his pretty much a clone of Jack

Draft - Cody Brand (academy, looks like a 2nd round prospect) gives us that Hooker/Hurley replacement"

Crauford is one one BF who gets talked up like he's some god-level state league player, so I'll take their word for it and give him another year.

Phillips one more year too just in case we need back up for Draper, as Bryan isn't fully developed yet."

5349,2020-09-19 11:37:49,ivnkjc,"Ah yeh, that does sound right actually. Scrap that idea then would rather a top 6 pick than William's"
5350,2020-09-19 11:27:07,ivnkjc,"its hard to put a value on them since they haven't played but they're both top 10 picks, contracted and still quite young. Take pick 10 as 10-15 (for Saad) and I feel like that range for them plus a future 2nd rounder coming back our way is probably fair. We also don't have a 2nd rounder atm so I'm not sure what else we'd use to get them, our future 2nd?"

If you just start with a bunch of kids all the same age with no experience around them they'll stagnate. Look at GWS. Did nothing until last year with the best young talent in the comp.

I honestly love thick, skinny, average, muscly, hairy or smooth, bearded or not, short or long hair, eyes, necks, every skin tone dark to pale. You can pull off just about anything with a good personality, passion for life, and some swagger.

5447,2020-09-15 21:12:15,itel60,Tbf to THR and Variety they have written articles for most if not all of Fisher‚Äôs retorts as well.
5448,2020-09-15 18:49:59,itel60,"A few thoughts:
- The Snyder Cut *was* a pipe dream at the time the Variety article was published.
- VF‚Äôa article being a distraction piece doesn‚Äôt line up with Fisher tweeting *positively* about the investigation on that day, and implies that both Muschiettis are working with WB against Ray Fisher.
- The Wrap‚Äôs article quotes Fisher as much as it does WB, and goes out of its way to explain both sides.
- The Deadline/Frosty article seems to have been fuckery on WB‚Äôs part, according to Momoa, but there‚Äôs no evidence that Deadline knew it was a fake story.

Based on what Ray Fisher and Jason Momoa have said, WB, Johns, Whedon, and Berg could‚Äôve acted terribly during Justice League‚Äôs production and the recent investigation.

However, none of your examples show that WB and media outlets are conspiring to malign Snyder or discredit Ray Fisher (especially since they‚Äôve consistently reported on Fisher‚Äôs allegations)."
5449,2020-09-15 18:44:07,itel60,These publications just receive news and report it. To think they are culpable in some grand conspiracy is incorrect.
5450,2020-09-15 18:48:00,itel60,"You think Deadline knew the Frosty news was fake? They were given a press release and shared the news with their readers. Variety posted the Frosty news too.

The Ben Affleck news had nothing to do with Ray Fisher. That's a huge reach on his part and it's not cool of him to bring Affleck into this. If Affleck had a bad experience, he can share that just like Momoa did. 

The Wrap didn't do anything wrong either. They published WB's official statement about the Ray Fisher situation. All of the trades posted it, as they should have.

Studios and your favorite actors and directors lie all the time. It's just the nature of this business."
5451,2020-09-15 18:35:27,itel60,Tbf on Variety the Snyder cut wasn‚Äôt actually happening until recently when Toby Emmerich ended up approaching Zack about finishing it. Zack himself thought it wasn‚Äôt happening anytime soon until he got the call.

5454,2020-09-15 18:32:38,itel60,"Mhmm. It's crazy how much these publications want to destroy their credibility for a scoop. But whatever, the truth shall prevail!"

5457,2020-09-15 18:42:36,itel60,"Execs are not your friends folks. They will lie to your face just for a couple of dollars. Quit defending them, you look dumb."
5458,2020-09-15 21:03:24,itel60,"Though honestly, a news outlet, even one that is just for the media trade, shouldn‚Äôt simply regurgitate whatever the studio tells them.  They should do follow-up to try and validate the story, or at minimum reach out to the other side for comment.

Of course, I know I‚Äôm being naive.  The Hollywood trade pubs have been buddy-buddy with the studios going back 80-90 years.  These are the folks that helped keep damaging info about various stars out of the news in exchange for some other piece of juicy gossip."
5459,2020-09-15 22:20:41,itel60,"Personally, I doubt they would have had Fisher broached the issue pre-ZSJL."

This. He fucked up with that. It just doesn‚Äôt add up. Everything at DC Fandome was prerecorded."
5461,2020-09-15 19:16:17,itel60,"Hey! Just saw your comment and thought I'd clarify.

The point isn't that these outlets are bad guys. The point is they are mouthpieces for the studio. Obviously, they cooperate to provide news. In this case, they cooperate for malicious purposes, even if the outlet doesn't know it."
5462,2020-09-15 19:11:08,itel60,"We have gone from ""the media/critics are unfair to DC"" to ""the media is teaming up with WB to push their version of the DC narrative."""
5463,2020-09-16 05:49:55,itel60,How much are you getting paid for defending the news channel?
5464,2020-09-15 18:44:28,itel60,Thanks for the reminder! Polished it up a bit.
5465,2020-09-15 19:39:52,itel60,Collider is full of wannabe/hacks.
5466,2020-09-15 21:23:31,itel60,FUCK that article. Seriously. The guy writing it sounds like he‚Äôs Kevin T‚Äôs dominatrix or something.

5469,2020-09-15 19:32:01,itel60,"Gotcha. The way it was worded made it seem like they were working together on this. A good site will try to tell both sides of the story. If WB gives them a statement, they should reach out to Fisher to get his side. And they've been doing that and covering his tweets."
5470,2020-09-15 19:39:23,itel60,"That's a worthwhile distinction, thanks for clarifying!"
5471,2020-09-15 20:05:38,itel60,I think cooperate is the wrong word it makes them seem in on it. WB puts out press releases and they just have to report on it. It would have seemed crazy if one of these publications put out a piece saying WB announced a frosty movie but it seems sketchy as hell we think it‚Äôs fake.
5472,2020-09-15 20:14:41,itel60,"I know, but still. He had a family tragedy, so for them to write something like that is terrible."
5473,2020-09-15 22:47:29,itel60,Obviously. But how many times has the studio turned out to be the good guys in situations like these? I can‚Äôt remember a single time honestly.
5474,2020-09-15 19:53:46,itel60,"Same can be said about people period.

That being said, if you are in a position of power you will whatever you can to maintain it, which can mean trying to discredit anyone* who is opposed to you (happens in politics,  anyone remember snake emojis?  Deflate stance over trivial things, ""Ray didn't want to say Booyah"") ....heck this is the same studio.....same people (sans Hamada and Lee) who used a man's tragedy as an opportunity to fire him yet claim he wanted a leave of absence just because producers (likely Geoff and Berg) wanted to go in a different direction 

Now, again I do think something happened and needs to be dealt with, but Ray also has to be careful because just simply looking on here it's splitting people, about.....maybe half of people commenting think he's making a fuss about nothing and the other believe him.  And it's that former half is what WB wants, to squash his complaints from the outside (PR and the trades) and within (fans).  I think people were fairly on board *after* Jason's statement, but with the Ben comment....it's back to a divide.  I would have let the Jason comment sit for a bit."
5475,2020-09-15 22:35:28,itel60,"I also believe Ray wouldn't be airing his grievances without ZSJL in the pipeline.

My greater point is that past patterns of RTSC/SC trade coverage did not establish a throughline of journalistic vigor concerning the subject. It is clear that their M.O./comfort zone is running what has been fed to them by establishment hands."
5476,2020-09-15 19:40:43,itel60,"I showed the snippet on the Discord too, and I didn't get this reaction. Everyone suggested I put it here, so I assumed the meaning was clear. Thank you for not screaming ""Conspiracy theorist!"" like some of the other replies though! So yeah, I apologise.

A point though. These outlets are fed words directly by Warner Bros. That's my point, and naturally, they covered the Ray Tweets because the WB response needs context. The studio gives details to these outlets and the outlets cover them. As I said, they're mouthpieces for the studio. In this case, the studio knew they were lying to Gonzalez. He just did his job. But it's obvious why someone like him would be fed their information."
5477,2020-09-15 20:13:02,itel60,"I understand that's where people got it wrong. But cooperation is still the correct word. They work together to deliver news. WB gives the journalist the info, and the journalist puts it out there. It's a cooperation. They're not reporting on what WB said elsewhere. This *is* where WB's words are made public. I didn't think anyone took it another way. I think everyone's too self-conscious about conspiracy theories recently, even though we're literally seeing a conspiracy to cover up abusive set behaviour and possible criminal actions unfold as we speak."
5478,2020-09-15 18:15:38,itcj7h,"I watched a couple of episodes when it came out.. and then they smacked you in the face with the ""evil white people"" enemy trying to destroy the diverse culture, and the Gordon good brother character.

Then they cram in the diverse lineup of dartboard characters that check off each box for representation, and the premise goes out the fucking window.  These people are supposed to be super rare, and special to be compatible with this technology, but somehow, out of the exceptionally small percentage of the population that their diverse line up has, they manage to check off all the boxes, except for the straight white male box... but he's evil....

Pure trash."

5483,2020-09-16 15:21:51,itcj7h,"I kinda like the series for the transhuman angle. The tech that allow the protagonists to pilot the mechs as shown and explained has such widespread implications, it could complete upend human society once the war is over and it becomes widely accessible.

Spoilers.

It's found out the reason she seems to have a bazillion superpowers and can't die is because she's a Motherbox who merged with the corpse of a freshly murdered girl named Gabrielle. Over halfway through the season, she's introduced as female to team members she's never met but then is like ""I don't know if I'm actually male or female guys, just because I'm called a Motherbox doesn't mean I'm actually a girl,"" and Geoforce is like ""It's ok BB I still love you uwu"" and it's literally NEVER brought up again and the character is still referred to a female.

Oh, and she shares a pointless kiss with another girl despite being in a relationship with Geoforce. It's like they're trying to cram every woke trait you could possibly put into a character and only the race lift has any bearing on the plot at all. It's so obvious."

5508,2020-09-16 02:48:31,itcj7h,"He‚Äôs a union actor on a film with a budget more than $2.5 million. The current rate for is $1,005/day. So it really depends on how many days he was on location."
5509,2020-09-15 17:21:27,itc3v8,"That's cool and I am glad to see more Gen Lock.

It seems RT is removing all traces of Gray."
5510,2020-09-15 16:50:33,itc3v8,"Kinda weird that they don't mention Koichi Yamadera with the returning cast, even though there's no word AFAIK he isn't.

Also generally positive looking news for the show.  Looking forward to the panel."
5511,2020-09-15 16:37:26,itc3v8,"1) It's good to see some news on Gen:Lock.

2) I'm glad that news is about including more diverse writers and storytelling.

3) EVAN IS BACK!!!"
5512,2020-09-15 16:24:42,itc3v8,This is great news. I just watched the first episode of Gen:Lock recently and I really enjoyed it. Can‚Äôt wait to see more of it. I wish everyone involved the best of luck with this.
5513,2020-09-15 16:33:56,itc3v8,"This is awesome. Proud of RT for being part of this.

I really, really enjoyed gen:LOCK. I am so excited for season 2. I'm pretty sad that Gray doesn't seem to be part of it now since it was his baby but I think it'll do him proud."
5514,2020-09-15 20:56:34,itc3v8,"Ah, yes, the second best Michael B. Jordan production at Rooster Teeth."
5515,2020-09-15 18:19:41,itc3v8,"So what exactly is this art style called? Its the same one used in RWBY right? It looks like source filmmaker animation sometimes imo, but i know its not that"
5516,2020-09-15 21:18:12,itc3v8,"I'm glad there's a second season, and I'm glad it's going to be developed under this initiative. I feel that will lead to a much stronger show."
5517,2020-09-15 17:04:11,itc3v8,"Yay more Gen:Lock news

Also good to hear about more diversity"
5518,2020-09-15 19:00:37,itc3v8,"Was Gen:Lock any good? I didn't really like RWBY past the second season, I haven't watched any RvB past the main story with the rogue AI dude and was wondering if Gen:Lock was work getting into?"
5519,2020-09-15 21:24:36,itc3v8,what does that mean?

5523,2020-09-15 20:12:36,itc3v8,I was really hoping they'd mention when RT stuff would show up on HBOMax.
5524,2020-09-15 20:02:44,itc3v8,Hope the framers can make it watchable this time.
5525,2020-09-15 17:24:01,itc3v8,"It's weird, his IMDB says he has a part in their Transformers show so I don't know if that was just in production for that long or if it's just that Michael has inherited Gen:lock now and is taking it in his own direction"

5529,2020-09-15 17:29:30,itc3v8,"I could see Variety just listing the big ""western"" names for draw."
5530,2020-09-15 18:41:15,itc3v8,"Honestly

I enjoyed Gen:Lock more than RWBY

And i love RWBY"
5531,2020-09-15 17:43:56,itc3v8,"Bit too much baggage there, I think."
5532,2020-09-15 21:08:58,itc3v8,Nothing will top the Michael B. Jordan podcast
5533,2020-09-15 18:41:51,itc3v8,"I guess the broad term is ""cel shading"", for when you try to [emulate the flat two-tone shading of 2D animation in 3D.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Toon-shader.jpg)

gen:LOCK and RWBY each have their own pipelines, but I believe both of them are animated in Maya, and then the characters are rendered in 3DSMax with a plugin called Pencil+ for the cel shading and outlines."
5534,2020-09-15 20:21:24,itc3v8,"It's pretty good overall, I liked it. Though I'd definitely say it has  *potential* hopefully, this season will remedy some of its world-building issues."
5535,2020-09-15 19:04:50,itc3v8,"I really love the show.

It's probably the most polished thing RT has put out in terms of production value and storytelling."
5536,2020-09-15 20:02:37,itc3v8,Completely different beast. Like Gundam with darker tones. I'd say give it a shot. Not comparible to the machinima or storytelling of RvB or the anime/magical nature of RWBY that got unbelievably dark layer on.
5537,2020-09-15 20:04:02,itc3v8,"It was a slow burn, but really became a thing. I liked it"
5538,2020-09-15 20:26:28,itc3v8,"I wouldn't exactly call it a comedy, so I can't really compare it to RvB or RWBY, but it's still a good show. I also didn't really like RWBY after a while, but Gen:Lock was way better imo. Definitely try it."
5539,2020-09-15 22:06:05,itc3v8,The plot is kinda cookie cutter for a robot show but there's a lot of good fights big and small
5540,2020-09-16 00:49:19,itc3v8,"I like it although it has issues. Although as a whole I think it‚Äôs better than RWBY, which I think had some general issues with its writing."
5541,2020-09-16 01:18:12,itc3v8,"Basically a standard mecha mixed with aspects of Sense 8. If you've seen a lot of mecha, it's decent, if you haven't  you might enjoy it more. 

I don't remember it doing anything story wise that really bothered me, unlike RWBY."
5542,2020-09-15 20:49:31,itc3v8,"It felt like it took a little to get going but it was pretty cool.  
Nothing amazing but I‚Äôd watch more."
5543,2020-09-15 21:40:23,itc3v8,"Shows are usually written by a team of writers, unlike a lot of RT's other content like RvB and RWBY (until Eddie and Kiersi joined) which were typically spearheaded by one or two people.

This article lists several newcomers who are now part of the g:L s2 writing team."
5544,2020-09-15 21:14:09,itc3v8,It's fine. But it's very unoriginal. Almost every single idea is lifted straight from other anime and games.
5545,2020-09-15 20:05:05,itc3v8,"It didnt start excellent, but turned itself into a top tier show. One of RTs strongest"
5546,2020-09-15 20:00:03,itc3v8,It's quite good.
5547,2020-09-15 22:38:13,itc3v8,I felt it started pretty good but near the end it throws away all pacing and wraps up everything as fast as it can. It is definitely a Gundam clone. It's really good for an RT show though.
5548,2020-09-16 06:36:56,itc3v8,It's in production right now.
5549,2020-09-15 20:22:37,itc3v8,"Did you even watch the show? Or just based this off the trailer.

The show itself was 100% watchable/fine."
5550,2020-09-15 17:29:50,itc3v8,RT was working on that Transformers thing while Burnie was still in the active spotlight. So that explains why he would have been credited.
5551,2020-09-15 19:00:24,itc3v8,"From my understanding,  Gen:lock is half owned by Michael through his production company, Outlier Society Productions."
5552,2020-09-15 17:31:05,itc3v8,"I thought Gray was still a part of the writing, just as an independent party."

5555,2020-09-15 20:12:55,itc3v8,the story is he misappropriated assets to make gen lock better than the other shows rt was making at the time and other drama
5556,2020-09-16 00:46:38,itc3v8,"[Long story short, he internally sabotaged several projects to cover genlock going hugely overbudget and is part of the reason why RWBY Volume 5 was a trainwreck season.

5558,2020-09-15 17:51:25,itc3v8,"That's my assumption as well, it's just still a bit weird."
5559,2020-09-15 21:00:51,itc3v8,Gen:Lock was just fun to watch. We haven't had a new show with this beefy of an animation style yet. RvB has had its moments and RWBY has had even better moments but Gen:Lock is awesome and tied to so many big names. I'm excited to see how this goes.
5560,2020-09-15 19:47:33,itc3v8,What happened ? I‚Äôve been out of the RT loop for a bit
5561,2020-09-16 02:30:47,itc3v8,Michael B Eatin
5562,2020-09-15 21:15:53,itc3v8,"Curious to see just how dark it is, considering most Gundam series can be pretty grim"
5563,2020-09-19 19:06:52,itc3v8,"... You know Gundam's already had darker tones, right?"
5564,2020-09-15 21:51:27,itc3v8,"...so there just adding more writers, what's this #changehollywood shit?"
5565,2020-09-16 20:20:29,itc3v8,The genlock boot up sequence where they connect the mind to the robot looks like it was lifted straight out of Eva
5566,2020-09-15 20:19:45,itc3v8,"Yeah. I feel like people saw an episode and it didn't hook them, which is fair! But *man* does it go some fucking places. It's so good. I really hope S2 goes more into the world though, and things are like they are."
5567,2020-09-16 06:43:23,itc3v8,So that‚Äôs good and I‚Äôm out of the loop but who‚Äôs Gray and why is he getting removed
5568,2020-09-15 17:42:57,itc3v8,"Gray only voiced Spinister, a minor character. He wasn't credited for the production, but he might have had a hand in the early stages."
5569,2020-09-15 19:06:52,itc3v8,"Wouldn't the owner of the show be HBO Max now? And RT and Outlier are the ones who make it *for* the plarform.

That's my understanding of the relationship between distributors and production companies."
5570,2020-09-15 17:40:56,itc3v8,"He said the door was open for that, but that didn't mean it would happen ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Tbh I would've liked to see him still writing since he seemed so passionate about the show. But alas."
5571,2020-09-17 04:20:25,itc3v8,Their talking about the Netflix Transformers show that came out recently not some movie. (which would be Paramount anyways)
5572,2020-09-15 20:46:05,itc3v8,That picture is worth several thousand words
5573,2020-09-15 20:29:27,itc3v8,Can I get a source on the first part? This is the first time I'm hearing about the missapropriation of assets
5574,2020-09-16 04:30:35,itc3v8,A lot of that read as rumors stated as outright facts. Like the whole Matt storming into animation sounds exaggerated. I can believe the issues with Nomad and GL being favored though.
5575,2020-09-16 10:56:51,itc3v8,"Yeah, Volume 5 was the season where I fell off of RWBY and haven‚Äôt watched it since. Something was just off about it"
5576,2020-09-16 11:47:50,itc3v8,"> He was also the person who allowed the crunch culture to reach the levels it did.

Seems weird to me to put all the blame onto Gray for the crunch"
5577,2020-09-16 16:22:24,itc3v8,">vol 5 was a trainwreck season

and that would be how you know to take that claim with a few continent's worth of salt..."
5578,2020-09-15 21:12:40,itc3v8,"My favorite part of the show was that the final, climactic battle took place in front of the Museum of Science & Industry in Chicago, a place I've actually been to. It's not often that futuristic sci fi animation takes place somewhere I've been."
5579,2020-09-15 19:54:09,itc3v8,"Gray was in charge during (and ultimately responsible for) the crunch scandal at RT Anim, and allegedly largely responsible for gL being overbudget, and neglecting other projects in its favour.

He was let go from the company."
5580,2020-09-15 22:33:12,itc3v8,"It's not really darker than Gundam. It's a lot shorter and has longer episodes so it doesn't really have as many decompress episodes as Gundam does. I haven't watched much UC so I can't speak to that, but I don't think it is as dark as IBO or Thunderbolt. I'd say it's more on par with 00."
5581,2020-09-15 21:56:44,itc3v8,They're not just adding white men.
5582,2021-02-10 06:42:10,itc3v8,"Yeah, I remember not really enjoying the first half of the show. I think the end was better, though if I remember correctly it still seemed very weirdly paced."
5583,2020-09-16 10:24:48,itc3v8,"You should look it up. He was the show's lead creative and head of RT Animation. He left after RT Anim was caught treating employees poorly. Awful crunch periods, promising steady jobs to contractors to motivate them to work extra hard and shafting them etc."
5584,2020-09-16 18:41:18,itc3v8,Gray was caught selling Rooster Teeth IP to a Chinese mining consortium.
5585,2020-09-15 19:25:59,itc3v8,"The show IP rights is owned by the studio(s) who made it (this case RT and Outlier).
HBO Max owns the broadcast rights of the season 2 and depending on contract/deal for a set time or indefinitely."
5586,2020-09-15 20:58:20,itc3v8,Last I remember he took stuff away from nomad to help gen lock give me a moment to see if I can find a source
5587,2020-09-15 21:01:07,itc3v8,https://youtu.be/H8mQfHrU0IE found this I forget if there was a more legit source
5588,2020-09-16 14:41:47,itc3v8,V6 was alright. Better than 5 anyway. V7 was sweet.
5589,2020-09-16 12:32:11,itc3v8,"The guy was head of the *entire* animation department and allowed it to fester. I've heard some accounts that he inherited a bad hand due to Burnie and Matt creating a crunch culture that was ingrained into the company until recently, but as head of animation he had the opportunity to pull back on what shows were being made and at what pace."
5590,2020-09-15 20:09:38,itc3v8,"Oh dang , man that sucks but I understand why they let him go."
5591,2020-09-15 21:59:39,itc3v8,"....ok? if they're the best for the job, then sure."
5592,2020-09-16 20:58:04,itc3v8,So I just remembered who Gray is but what use RT IP to a mining company?
5593,2020-09-15 23:51:04,itc3v8,"Well, streaming rights. Most likely season 2 will air on Toonami like 1 did."
5594,2020-09-15 21:24:08,itc3v8,"That *would* explain that episode where they got attacked by a giant, angry doodle. (No, I haven't actually watched Gen: Lock)"
5595,2020-09-16 00:00:01,itc3v8,Shit that really sucks if true. I loved Nomad of Nowhere and it really deserved a season 2. Also makes sense why the creator left now.
5596,2020-09-15 21:16:28,itc3v8,"Seems like they've done a lot of research but I had to bow out after about 5 minutes.

Can't handle the whole 56 mins when it feels like I'm being both shouted and whispered at as they waffle between each point. Calm down and focus!"
5597,2020-09-17 02:38:24,itc3v8,"I just finished 6 and 7 in the past three days after stepping away from RWBY after season 5.

Six's first half was pretty good, but I wasn't a fan of most of the second half. >!Everything dealing with the commander and the soldiers felt like a different show. And half the Oscar stuff wasn't great. Plus they should have pushed the Cinder stuff for Season 7 to put in more Adam to have a better development and payoff.!<

I liked 7. Looking forward to 8 now."
5598,2020-09-16 13:58:55,itc3v8,"Crunch culture was probably a lot different when Monty and Shane were their only animators. Two guys doing all or most of the work is gonna lead to some crunch time. Now they have a whole team of animators, crunch time shouldnt exist"
5599,2020-09-16 20:17:59,itc3v8,"I mean the fact that RVB and later RWBY had massive crunch may have set the precedent for a crunch culture I‚Äôm not sure it was encouraged. 

I wish I could remember what episode of the RT podcast it was but I distinctly remember Burnie talking about how he wouldn‚Äôt allow a cot or something because he felt that would encourage crunch. And how they were ok with crunch when it was creators being passionate and consciously choosing to work that hard like they did on RVB and Monty did on RWBY."
5600,2020-09-16 13:05:11,itc3v8,"I was moreso specifically talking about the crunch stuff compared to the other stuff. I know he was the head of animation, but there's a whole ass company behind them too. For as long as he was the head, surely it must have been known about the whole crunch thing. Like, I get there was more behind the scenes stuff, and actual corporate stuff, but to me it made it seem like you were implying the crunch was solely the fault of Gray, when RT themselves should be taking responsibility too.

e: I was basically trying to say that ""He was also the person who allowed the crunch culture to reach the levels it did"" is a weird thing to say when it was the company itself that allowed it."
5601,2020-09-15 20:13:24,itc3v8,Yeah. I don't think it was malicious. I think the studio just grew beyond what he was capable of managing.
5602,2020-09-15 23:54:25,itc3v8,"This ""best for the job"" shtick is such bullshit."
5603,2020-09-16 21:36:43,itc3v8,Mining mechs.
5604,2020-09-17 04:22:29,itc3v8,"I agree on the second half of season 6, just the execution of it rather then the general concept of the story in that half."
5605,2020-09-16 20:10:29,itc3v8,"It took them too long to grow up from the 'indie, making RvB out of Burnie's spare room, working ridiculous hours on your passion project' kind of mentality.

Its one thing when it was a small team, and everybody was friends, and all pushing to build something from the ground up. Its a whole other thing when you're trying to run a professional studio."
5606,2020-09-16 20:18:18,itc3v8,I mean that and Monty was just a workaholic anyway.
5607,2020-09-15 21:07:00,itc3v8,"The interns statement said they were threatened with being fired iirc, seems malicious to me"
5608,2020-09-15 23:47:18,itc3v8,"Yeah, he only had the position cause he had some previous managerial experience, definitely a mistake not hiring a proper manager when the department expanded.

Plus with crunch it wasn‚Äôt exactly malicious just unfortunate ignorance of the new situation of the animation department, whereas before in the earlier days people like Miles, Kerry, Gray, etc would go into crunch because of passion for their projects, once expanded, these animators were there as staff to work so crunch was more because of time constraints and stress. Hard to see it when you‚Äôre still in the old mindset. But it doesn‚Äôt seem too bad of a break up if they‚Äôre still working together on projects."
5609,2020-09-16 05:46:36,itc3v8,"What? I'm not trying to say diversity isn't important, or that having non-white writers is a bad thing. I just think having diversity for the sake of diversity, and hiring people because of the colour of their skin and not for their talents is just as bad as hiring only white people. If the person a minority, and their a talented writer then there's no problem having them join the team, same goes for being white, they should hire the best writers available, and not just ones and fill a diversity quota."
5610,2020-09-16 16:25:50,itc3v8,Ok Kiki
5611,2020-09-16 15:08:15,itc3v8,"Once again ""Diversity Quota"" is another bullshit word. There is not quota, otherwise you'd see more diverse writers rooms. 

Instead it's very much a white industry, where minorities find it hard to break into."
5612,2020-09-16 17:08:08,itc3v8,"Prove me wrong.

It's used when POC or Women exclusively."
5613,2020-09-16 15:38:41,itc3v8,"i, don't fully see how this relates to the topic at hand, but i think we can both agree that, yes, film and TV are a white people dominated medium, and that there needs be a more broad spectrum of people from different walks of live. my point is that hiring for the sole reason that they'll make a writers room more diverse is just as bad as not hiring them for the same reason: their race. it's still kinda racist, and might not be the best hiring decision."
5614,2020-09-16 17:11:14,itc3v8,Prove *me* wrong Kiki.
5615,2020-09-14 20:45:30,ist0kb,"amazing find (finally, a Wayne Coyne collab!) but I hope this doesn't mean they're preparing to launch another double single anytime soon. Just put out one new song every 3 or so weeks until the album comes out, no need to overload us with prerelease stuff."

5623,2020-09-15 02:43:31,ist0kb,Pat Metheny and Wayne Coyne could be a fun mix - even if they're both just samples :)
5624,2020-09-15 11:07:08,ist0kb,">Dial D for Devotion looks like the band Woods is involved, either as a feature or a sample.

Woods was Dave Berman‚Äôs backing band on Purple Mountains.   I‚Äôm guessing a sample from that record."

Sure, some are too angry and ignorant of others just like some of my baby boomer and Gen X friends are.  But kicking the members of an entire generation, any generation to the curb is ridiculous.

PS, OP left out the fact that every single member of the LGBTQ community can thank the baby boomers for the advancement gay rights we all benefit from and for the fact LGBTQ baby boomers suffering made life better for following generations of LGBT folks."
5635,2020-11-09 08:31:41,jqttzh,"As a millennial I think calling all of us angsty party animals with no responsibility is as bad as hating on all old people. Most of us are now in our 30s with kids. There‚Äôs trash people in every age group, there are also amazing people in every group."

5640,2020-11-09 08:16:27,jqttzh,I agree. Most of the people I hang out with (I‚Äôm 19) are boomers or gen x.
5641,2020-11-09 08:20:17,jqttzh,Did I miss something? When were older people started being terrible and cringeworthy?
5642,2020-11-09 10:21:46,jqttzh,Boomers suck. They take and keep on taking.

All my aunts and uncles are also Gen-X, having been born 1966 and after, and my grandparents are all Silent Gen, born 1936-44. We all spend every holiday complaining together about the damn Boomers. It's one of few things that really unite the whole family."
5644,2020-11-09 08:34:11,jqttzh,"Haha I‚Äôm a millennial, and I meant Gen X in that comment (most of them would 100% agree with me btw and they‚Äôd probably wear it like a badge of honor). Gen Z is a muuuch smaller Gen with a much less diverse set of attributes. Think Hair Bands and 80s culture. I see your point tho."

5654,2020-11-09 14:23:11,jqttzh,One what?
5655,2020-11-09 19:03:51,jqttzh,The job market isn't all that great and employment process is more complicated these days. It's more work finding work than it should be.
5656,2020-11-09 08:18:47,jqttzh,That‚Äôs not true though.
5657,2020-11-09 12:11:54,jqttzh,"I am Gen X and can confirm the chaotic evil thing, but I am an introvert and geek who has never actually been to a party as far as I can remember and there are actually a lot of Gen X geeks who never partied. Maybe you are thinking of the Xers who were beautiful at one time, but beautiful people are always a minority."
5658,2020-11-09 08:44:00,jqttzh,I know they are but I never understood why

I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs plenty of awesome Gen Xers and I can accept the feedback that it was in poor taste to generalize by that broad of a margin. Apologies for the overstep."

5662,2020-11-09 08:23:46,jqttzh,Word. Looking forward to the first one I meet that changes my mind.
5663,2021-02-15 02:16:34,jqttzh,"My dad is an Xer and he isn‚Äôt bad. If anything, he‚Äôs like a Zoomer and a Boomer mixed. He‚Äôs pretty cool, taught me how to play Magic: The Gathering, went fishing with me, and like me, he liked but didn‚Äôt care much for 80‚Äôs music, only some 80‚Äôs music. I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs my dad. That‚Äôs not all, but I have something to say.


Not all Gen Xers are bad.

5664,2020-11-09 08:56:05,jqttzh,"Yeah that‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs just like think ab how many of each generation there are. Every generations gonna have good people, bad people, annoying fucks. Younger generations probably gonna have more annoying because well... theyre young and stupid."
5665,2020-11-10 00:00:35,jqttzh,You don‚Äôt sound very open.
5666,2020-11-09 14:32:26,jqttzh,Of course. Grumpy and ranting about generational differences?. Some people can easily defy stereotypes. Including generational ones.
5667,2020-11-09 08:58:13,jqttzh,I get ya. Point well made.
5668,2020-11-10 00:04:20,jqttzh,Sigh how many times to I have to tell this thread that I apologize for the overstep lmao I‚Äôve admitted that it was in poor taste to generalize that broadly multiple times now.
5669,2020-11-09 14:34:06,jqttzh,"Somewhere in the comments I admitted last night that it was in poor taste to generalize on that broad of a margin. I hear you, and I see your point"
5670,2020-11-09 14:42:47,jqttzh,I'm Gen X born in 1974. There are open minded people of different generations i can hit it off with. It depends entirely upon attitude.
5671,2020-11-09 14:48:06,jqttzh,I totally get that. And I agree. Nice to meet you!
5672,2020-11-09 14:48:53,jqttzh,This is not a meeting. This is a comment on Reddit

5674,2020-11-09 14:53:46,jqttzh,That's an 1980s phrase from the rap and hip-hop crowd. Unless you have a double entrende in mind.
5675,2020-11-09 14:56:08,jqttzh,"Most 1980s rappers were boomers, but again I did admit the generalization was too broad. I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre looking for"
5676,2020-11-09 14:58:27,jqttzh,What do you mean? Why do you think i am looking for something?
5677,2020-11-09 15:00:32,jqttzh,Because you keep trying to prove me wrong or point out some inconsistency even after I‚Äôve admitted I was wrong multiple times... So what are you looking for?
5678,2020-11-09 15:06:26,jqttzh,I'm commenting on a Reddit post. I don't even know you. You don't know me. I'm not invested in proving anyone or anything. I am a realist. What do you assume I'm trying to prove?
5679,2020-11-09 15:08:13,jqttzh,What a strange interaction.

5697,2020-11-01 20:31:02,jm90kf,I appreciate you using tiers rather than numerical rankings. It‚Äôs a much more accurate way to rank players. For some reason people obsess over putting numbers on something.
5698,2020-11-01 20:07:39,jm90kf,"**1)** As I got further down and less of the guys appeared on top-100 lists, I needed to look at some less popular & sloppier lists (but that had more players), which included the Slam top-500 (2011) and top-70 position rankings put out by the Orlando Magic (*2018 - updated in 2020 to only top-50*), plus BRef‚Äôs HOF% since it factors in things like ASG's and statistical rankings and titles, which do a lot to sway general perception about a player. The BRef HOF%'s were particularly helpful when trying to figure out where to slot current guys, especially 25-year-old Giannis Antetokounmpo. 

**2)** Durant and Curry will probably be firmly in Tier 2 within a season or two, and some people may already feel they're ranked around there anyway (*especially Durant*). I decided not to even bold them in Tier 3 since their placements are still obviously in a bit of flux, but the ""places"" for this pair of 32 year olds should thicken up shortly. 

**3)** I left a lot of way old-school guys off the list since it gets really hard to rank guys from the 40's/50's with or against guys who played a much more modern game. A few guys left off due to lack of evidence their games would translate well more modernly include Mikan, Schayes, Arizin, Hagan, Sharman, Gola, Yardley, Johnston, Gallatin .... you get the idea. The only 2 players from before Bill Russell who made it are Bob Cousy & Bob Pettit, both of whom I personally feel there is a preponderance of evidence they could translate to other eras and still be quite successful. Similarly, I'm missing some ABA guys who I'll probably find a way to work into Tier 7 at some point if upon a little more investigation I determine there is a general consensus that they were really good all-timers, buys like Ron Boone and Mack Calvin. Dampier and Daniels are already in with strong enough reputations on these types of lists.

**4)** Things obviously got kind of difficult past Tier 5. In Tier 6, there were some sorta obvious top-third and bottom-third groupings that appeared, which is why that group has both some bolded (*top-third*) and italicized (*bottom-third*). The guys in Tier 6.5 were tough/awkward to place since they often seemed to be ranked around 175-225 all-time, but I felt weird making a whole tier after Tier 6 that was smaller than Tier 6, but it was too many guys to just throw into Tier 7 and bold them all. I think fans can understand that when figuring out the 200th to 300th best players of all-time, there's far more debate and overlap and confusion than there is when we're talking about the 20th vs 30th best players all-time."
5699,2020-11-01 23:27:44,jm90kf,"I understand Big O‚Äôs been high on all time lists for years but with new understanding of pace, triple doubles not being seen as valuable post Russ and the fact that he could never really win any championships as the best player on his team makes it difficult to put him top 10 for me. 

Everyone else who has an argument for top 10 has at least a ring as the best player on the team, if not more."
5700,2020-11-01 20:12:55,jm90kf,"Why not use BR's top 50 from 2019?

5701,2020-11-02 00:47:08,jm90kf,This is really good list. I think Klay should be higher though and Giannis should be top 56 just off the 2 MVP‚Äôs and DPOY

There are so many players you forgot Joel Embiid lol I hope you don‚Äôt think Andre Drummond is better than Joel Embiid that isn‚Äôt true and it would be unfortunate if you thought that I really hope you didn‚Äôt think Bill Cartwright was better than Joel Embiid or I will cry and then I will make you cry. All joking aside cool post dawg.

imo you could use any list if you wanted to but only take their order of  retired players and use the most recent lists to slot active players into here - it's not like you're ranking 38th vs 39th, you're just putting them in basic ranges and tiers"
5726,2020-11-01 18:28:32,jm6i9a,"I've noticed these lists tend to have a lot of recency bias. Not only that, but I consider most of them to be flat out horrible. It just doesn't make sense to me to rank more than a few players, much less every single one in NBA history. There's simply bound to be many huge mistakes.

Nice idea to make a sort of consensus-ranking though. Now instead of criticizing individual lists, we can all laugh at their collective stupidity, lol."
5727,2020-11-02 15:16:55,jm6i9a,"this is a really fun list that I totally disagree with! (lol; j/k - it's exhaustive and interesting and an argument starter)

Thanks for putting the time into this; it's much more exhaustive than the ones I've tried to do in the past, so just looking over the tiers is a fun way to remember these guys. I think one thing this group might try to do at some point (I'd love to be involved) is make a page for each of these players, where different contributors sort of ""adopted"" a player and wrote about them, and then if someone else wanted to write, we could add to that. This would be a great start. So if you clicked on Swen Nater, you might find a page that has a few  Lamarmatic videos, a writeup, maybe even an argument for why he's underrated and where is he now?

This stuff is out there, and it would be cool if we had like a database, but I'm teaching college during a pandemic and probably don't have time to do it; still it's something to consider ;)"
5728,2020-11-01 17:57:26,jm6i9a,"**1)** As I got further down and less of the guys appeared on top-100 lists, I needed to look at some less popular & sloppier lists (but that had more players), which included the Slam top-500 (2011) and top-70 position rankings put out by the Orlando Magic (*2018 - updated in 2020 to only top-50*), plus BRef‚Äôs HOF% since it factors in things like ASG's and championships and statistical rankings, all of which do a lot to sway general perception about a player. The BRef HOF%'s were particularly helpful when trying to figure out where to slot current guys, especially 25-year-old Giannis Antetokounmpo. 

**2)** Durant and Curry will probably be firmly in Tier 2 within a season or two, and some people may already feel they're ranked around there anyway (*especially Durant*). I decided not to even bold them in Tier 3 since their placements are still obviously in a bit of flux, but the ""places"" for this pair of 32 year olds should thicken up shortly. 

**3)** I left a lot of way old-school guys off the list since it gets really hard to rank guys from the 40's/50's with or against guys who played a much more modern game. A few guys left off due to lack of evidence their games would translate well more modernly include Mikan, Schayes, Arizin, Hagan, Sharman, Pollard, Davies, Martin, Twyman, Gola, Yardley, Johnston, Gallatin .... you get the idea. The only 2 players from before Bill Russell who made it are Bob Cousy & Bob Pettit, both of whom I personally feel there is a preponderance of evidence they could translate to other eras and still be quite successful. Similarly, I'm missing some ABA guys who I'll probably find a way to work into Tier 7 at some point if upon a little more investigation I determine there is a general consensus that they were really good all-timers, guys like Ron Boone and Mack Calvin. Dampier and Daniels are already in with strong enough reputations on these types of lists.

**4)** Things obviously got kind of difficult past Tier 5. In Tier 6, there were some sorta obvious top-third and bottom-third groupings that appeared, which is why that group has both some bolded (*top-third*) and italicized (*bottom-third*). The guys in Tier 6.5 were tough/awkward to place since they often seemed to be ranked around 175-225 all-time, but I felt weird making a whole tier after Tier 6 that was smaller than Tier 6, but it was too many guys to just throw into Tier 7 and bold them all. I think fans can understand that when figuring out the 200th to 300th best players of all-time, there's far more debate and overlap and confusion than there is when we're talking about the 20th vs 30th best players all-time."

5730,2020-11-01 20:07:32,jm6i9a,"(I Read the disclaimer, just pointing that out)

In basketball, a team sport, why do most fans and media so often ignore the star players that were exceptional teammates while praising players who were/are notorious jackasses?

I get it, MJ was sick to watch and he won 6 rings. But around any other cast of characters aside from Scottie and Phil, he wouldn't have done jack shit. MJ requires your GM to get such a specific set of personalities around him to the point where I'd say he could never have pulled off Kobe's role around Shaq. His success in our timeline (4+ MVPs, 4+ titles just to keep things simple), just in comparison to himself, is irreplicable 99% of the time when ignoring injuries.

In contrast, I'd say Tim Duncan's success (2 MVPs, 3+ rings) is replicable in a good 70% of scenarios when comparing him to himself. By all accounts, he was the pillar of SA's culture during their run, even though fans and even outside players want to chock it all up to Pop.

You cannot find a teammate that didn't love Duncan, whereas Luc Longley straight-up refused to be in The Last Dance because he hated Jordan so damn much. Steve Kerr even said on BoB 2.0 in comparison of the two ""It felt like you were player with Timmy. It felt like you were playing for Jordan."" If that's not a damning indictment of  MJ as a player in a team sport, I don't know what is.

I believe the GOAT discussion and anything that sets out to rank players should look at both what was, what could have been in the current timeline, and how those players would perform in vastly different circumstances.

The GOAT debate for me is between Duncan, Bird, Russell, and LeBron (though I will admit to not knowing enough about Kareem's personality in the locker room). We got to see the first three in quality scenarios immediately (though people forget how little actual help Duncan had from about 2000-2004, the literal heart of his prime). LeBron as a bit of a headcase gets a pass from me because his first seven years were spent trusting a Cavs front office that didn't know basketball from racquetball, so it makes a lot of sense as to why he because a bit of a control freak; the first front office he ever trusted destroyed his trust in front-offices.

Wilt was a headcase WITH good players, Magic made Kareem demand a trade to either the dead Knicks or the faking Nets, and MJ was a jackass even after his front office executed an amazing build to contention - yet he hated Krause for the Oakley trade, oh boo fucking hoo."
5731,2020-11-01 18:31:28,jm6i9a,"Agreed. Getting them into general consensus groupings made more sense to me from the beginning, and I also agree this now makes it easier to criticize the over-arching collective stupidity of fans/""experts"" regarding NBA history, lol."
5732,2020-11-02 19:23:31,jm6i9a,"That would be rad! Like many folks, I'm a bit overwhelmed with stuff right now during the pandemic, and I hastily add things to this sub faster than most people probably think. 

That being said, currently I'm focused on 2 things for the sub: 1) reaching back out to u/dillardcrockerGOAT who's helping me with some research for a Bob Kurland piece (*sorry it's taking so long*), and 2) raising a small amount of money for this sub in order to a) get a subscription to Basketball Reference's Stathead page so I can get back to providing better statistical context for guys like I used to do using their stat-sorting feature (that costs ~$100/yr), and b) find the best way to externally back-up everything that is on this sub since we've collectively created a ton of really good writing and memories and research about NBA history that I want to make sure can never be lost/erased and is always accessible to people. I want to raise the money by selling some limited edition t-shirts an artist friend of mine made for me of Jordan, Magic, and Bird (*it's not much money needed, but I want to keep this sub completely free since it is reddit so selling a little bit of merch at least makes it a real transaction and not just me asking for a couple hundred bucks*). I need to make a post real soon about the shirts and see who's interested .... yeah, sometime soon."
5733,2020-11-01 20:09:54,jm6i9a,"I'll point out that I rank Duncan 2nd all-time (behind only Russell), so I'm totally on-board with that part of the comment, and most of it in general."

To be fair, MJ's popularity and fame was unlike anything any other basketball player has seen before or since. He retreated into his own inner circle by the second three-peat (when Kerr played with him) and was definitely disconnected from the team outside of those few he trusted (Pip and Phil). So I can see why Kerr felt like he was playing *for* Jordan. 

There was a scene in *The Last Dance* where Jordan's sitting in his office before a game, hanging with his crew, and in comes Randy Brown (I think it was?) to ask MJ if he could get some tickets for his family. It had a total Godfather vibe to it - the supplicant coming into the Godfather's office to kiss the ring and ask for a favor."
5735,2020-11-01 22:04:09,jm6i9a,"Who cares that Kareem demanded a trade. Or MJ was difficult. Or Lebron‚Äôs well Lebron . Or San Antonio‚Äôs culture. 
I find it amusing how all I ever read hear is how Kareem was difficult with the media. I never read about Larry Bird being a dead beat dad, and then a dead beat grandfather. Larry‚Äôs admitted  he didn‚Äôt take care of himself, leading to lower back problems, and drank after every game. 
Pro sports is about one thing. Winning Championships. 
I‚Äôll take 6 MVP‚Äôs and 6 championships over 2 and 3. 

In the GOAT debate , if we are  going to bring up being nice to the media, team mates , GM , etc . Maybe it is only fair that you include an athletes entire canvas of work. Not picking and choosing what‚Äôs convenient. That would include post career."
5736,2020-11-01 20:23:45,jm6i9a,"It's all about results.   You may dislike Jordan because he was a hyper competitive jackass but there is zero scenario where any other player of the era does what Jordan did with any of Jordans teammates.  Does Reggie Miller, Scottie Pippin and Horace Grant win three titles?  (Spoiler.  They don't.)

You are taking on the court results and discounting them because you think a player was a bad teammate. The best teammate is the guy that wins.  The greatest winner (as the leader of their team) in the post ABA merger is Jordan. That makes him the absolute best teammate.   Oh he didn't like Jerry Krause?   Boo fucking hoo."
5737,2020-12-21 00:32:37,jm6i9a,"I've never given it too much thought, but never believed the Bulls teams were stocked with great players. Pippen became great because of Jordan. I felt MJ carried those guys on his back."

I agree. That's my whole point. I'm looking at both how successful a player was during their career, and how those players would have performed in vastly different circumstances. What players have a style of play and personality that can create a winning culture in the widest variety of circumstances? I believe that superstars who are also good teammates have a higher likelihood of creating a winning culture in a wider variety of circumstances than players who aren't. Why are we discounting the value of being a good teammate when we're talking about a team sport?

Your point on Larry's conditioning and drinking, the more I look into it, seems to be dead-on so he's out of my GOAT conversation."

That wasn't the point of my argument, like, at all.

> You are taking on the court results and discounting them because you think a player was a bad teammate.

No, I'm not. I'm discounting on-court results of certain players because the scenarios themselves are incredibly difficult to replicate with certain players (MJ), while far easier to do so with others (Duncan, Bron, Russell, etc).

Of the four guys named, MJ would see the least success when thrown into a wide variety of situations.

I think you need to reread what I wrote..."

5744,2020-11-02 00:05:13,jm6i9a,"I actually feel sorry for Jordan, this distance from his teammates. There was (to me) a heartbreaking scene near the end of *The Last Dance* - the Bulls has just won their sixth chip, Jordan had his amazing 45 point game with the layup, steal, jumper to seal the victory, and where was Jordan? Was he partying and celebrating with his teammates? Was he spending time with his wife and kids? Nope, he was up in his hotel room with his inner circle and the documentarians. 

They just capped off the second three peat and his team was no where to be found. And I don‚Äôt think this was because MJ was a terrible team mate, so much as it was him feeling forced to retreat into his own small, inner circle due to his worldwide fame."
5745,2020-11-01 22:50:31,jm6i9a,"Kareem has really changed the last 20 years. He writes books and produces documentaries on African American History. Also frequently writes commentary on social issues. He is very big, always has been on education. He raises money for STEM schools in LA. 

The media in the 1980‚Äôs created this whole persona that all Larry did was work on his craft. This went over really well in rural white America. I am pretty sure the inner city guys were working just as hard."
5746,2020-11-01 22:27:16,jm6i9a,"I disagree with Jordan having the least success when thrown into different scenarios.  He won 3 titles in a row with two almost completely different teams.  And he barely missed a beat.  That Bulls team he came back to was not good.  They were 34-31 when he came back.  With baseball Jordan they finish the season 13-4.  Then the entire roster is changed, and they win 72 games.  There is no one great player in NBA history who had a bigger change  in the roster surrounding him who continued winning titles.   How can you claim MJ would have the least success if thrown into a wide variety of situations, when he's the only guy to show he can do exactly that?"
5747,2020-11-01 23:03:22,jm6i9a,"I actually owe a lot to Kareem. Learning about him to a smaller extent when I was younger helped me to deconstruct and do away with certain prejudices I had.

5775,2020-10-30 12:36:24,jkvml0,"I feel like the biggest thing that really hurts Bill Russell's legacy is the lack of competitiveness and professionalism in the league when he played. This is definitely no fault of his and you can only beat the team in front of you, but the fact is that the average talent level in the league then was not comparable to that of the modern era of basketball. I don't mean this in the sense of him not having great rivals (Russell v Wilt is an all time great rivalry), but the average talent of the league as a whole. Not to mention that the league was a lot smaller back then too."
5776,2020-10-30 12:29:21,jkvml0,"The first year of the finals mvp being awarded it went to Jerry West, who said he hated that award (he played amazing but the Lakers lost). From then on it never went to a member of the losing team. It's fair to say that Bill Russell would most likely get at least seven finals mvps in the other ten finals he won, giving him the most of all time. Russell's legacy would be also helped if blocks were recorded and assists were easier to get like they are now (based on what constitutes a recorded assist). Most students of the game know that Bill Russell is the best of his era and one of if he best of all time. Especially when it comes to winning, which in a team sport, is the main priority. Comparing across eras is stupid but if you combine that with recency bias then the old legends seem to get less respect than they deserve. Not to mention he was up against the Klan, marched with King and stood with Ali. We have a lot to be thankful for when it comes to Bill Russell."
5777,2020-10-30 15:06:52,jkvml0,"I think Russell‚Äôs game translate better to modern NBA than a lot of people might think

In his best years(62-65) he has a great mix of starting the breaks with his passing and use his athleticism to finish on the other end

I believe playing in today nba( without considering the development of a jumpshot), Bill can be a better version of a hybryd of Draymond Green and Rudy Gobert which is god damn scary if you think about it."
5778,2020-10-30 14:13:09,jkvml0,"I mean the finals MVP is named after him, really all you can want in terms of recognition. Sad to think he probably only has a few more years left of being able to give the award out in person. He is a real champ and the work he's done for equality is top notch"
5779,2020-10-30 15:26:28,jkvml0,"One of the the things I learned reading Terry Pluto‚Äôs awesome oral history of the origins of the NBA ‚ÄúTall Tales‚Äù was that before Bill it was considered bad fundamentals to jump while playing defense, given the poor shooting %s of that era I can see how that makes some sense; but you could say Bill Russell invented jumping."
5780,2020-10-30 13:55:54,jkvml0,"I like this write up as a breakdown of why Bill is special. I think the overall premise though is less of a thing than you might think it is. Russell may not have any Finals MVPs, but the award is named after him. I think this preserves his legacy just fine. By the NBA and its players, Bill is (as he should be) treated as royalty. Are you talking about him not being included in the GOAT conversation? The existence of that line of debate is unfortunate and really is just fan service. I think its fair to look at each player for what they achieved in their era and honor them for it. If someone happens to bring up Michael Jordan recognize a casual when you see one and move on."
5781,2020-10-30 14:22:35,jkvml0,"Fact: Celtics didn‚Äôt start winning until Bill was on board. All Bill ever did was win championships - 2 in college, 11 in the NBA. He was a ferocious competitor. He was probably the best team defensive player in NBA history, he initiated the fast break and often finished the break, he was a great athlete, and his Basketball IQ was top shelf. To me, he was the GOAT."
5782,2020-10-30 13:53:53,jkvml0,"So, the NBA didn't even start announcing Finals MVP awards until Russell's last year (1969). I don't see how a guy's legacy can be negatively impacted when an award didn't even exist until his last year in the league *and* the award is named after him.

Russell is one of the GOATs in NBA lore. He may not be Jordan in terms of legacy but as a big man, he quite arguably is the GOAT among post guys."
5783,2020-10-30 13:54:51,jkvml0,"Modern fans just have a hard time appreciating a player who was primarily a star on defense.  That‚Äôs because the players have steadily become better on offense and the rules have changed to help the offense.  It‚Äôs just hard to imagine Bill Russell as an MVP in any era but his own, because there has never been another MVP who was, essentially, a defensive specialist.

The only other championship team built around a defensive superstar was the 2004 Detroit Pistons.  Ben Wallace should have won Finals MVP, but instead Chauncey Billups won it because he was their best player on offense.

The reason Ben Wallace could lead the Pistons to a championship was that just a few years earlier the league legalized the zone defense.  This gave defenses a new advantage and year by year scoring dropped around the league.  Finally defense became so important that non-scorer Ben Wallace could lead his team to a championship.  

That summer the NBA took action with the express purpose of helping perimeter offense.  They banned hand checking, restricted blocking, and cracked down on violations of the defensive three second rule.  

Since then perimeter players have become so good at shooting threes that even centers are stationed at the three point line, forcing a great defender like Rudy Gobert out of the paint.

In contrast. Bill Russell could stand in the paint all day, there were no three point shots, and many players back then had a hard time hitting shots 15 feet from the basket.

That said, Russell was still a defensive genius.  He essentially invented help defense, where he guarded not just his own man but every shot he could reach.  Unlike Wilt, Russell did not care about stats at all.  In an era where even coaches did not preach defense, he proved that defense could win championships.

Eventually Wilt won championships by emulating Russell.  He had a coach who got through to him that he could set records on offense or he could win more games by focusing on defense.  But the whole league started to appreciate defense.  In 1968-69, the league started honoring defense with the NBA All-Defensive Team.  The pace of the game gradually slowed.  Red Holzman won championships with defense in New York.  The NBA made blocks and steals part of the box score.  

But as defenses became better, offenses responded, assisted by rule changes.  Players learned to shoot from outside, and with the advent of the three point line they learned to shoot three-point bombs from way outside.  The league cracked down on flagrant fouls, started calling more blocks than charges, and relaxed the enforcement of palming and carrying the ball. They added a third referee and increased fines and penalties for fighting or rough play.  The shot clock was reset less often, then reset to 14 seconds instead of 24.  Finally, in 2004-05 the MBA eliminated hand checking, restricted blocking, and strictly enforced the 3-second rule.  All the while players were getting better at three point shots and coaches finally began to encourage three point shooting.

So today offense is king.  That‚Äôs not to say defense is unimportant.  But we just can‚Äôt image Rudy Gobert winning MVP no matter how good he is on defense.  Would a non-shooter like Ben Wallace fit into today‚Äôs game?  Even in his own day Wallace could not win MVP or Finals MVP.  

So it‚Äôs difficult to imagine a defensive superstar like Russell winning MVP, let alone five MVPs.  And that‚Äôs why people have a hard time talking about Russell as the GOAT, or even in the conversation for GOAT.  Despite his incredible athleticism and basketball IQ and individual and team success, his success just seems so tied to his era."
5784,2020-10-30 19:00:50,jkvml0,This is basically Bill Simmons's main point in the Book of Basketball where he talks about the secret of basketball. Wilt collected stats and put up records that will never be touched. Russell was the ultimate price of a championship team and it was down to him that the Celtics won all those titles
5785,2020-10-30 18:10:11,jkvml0,"Great write up! If anyone hasn't seen it yet, do check out the Youtube series ""Making the Case."" There's a fantastic video on Russell.

Guys like Wilt, Kareem, MJ, and LeBron were more offensively gifted, but Russell beats them in the only stat that really matters: winning.

If we want to talk about RINGZ, I don't see how Russell isn't the undisputed GOAT. 11 championships in 13 years. I don't care if you're playing in little kid whiffle ball league, being the top dog in any competition/sport for a decade is insane."
5786,2020-10-30 20:37:22,jkvml0,"I mean, Bill Russell is largely regarded as no worse than a top-5 player of all time. He's recognized as the epitome of winning with class. He has the universal respect of everybody who has ever played the game, is an icon to black Americans, and you generally have to pick white Americans' jaws off the floor when you tell them about the shit (in some cases, literally) he endured. 

I would argue that the only athlete whose legacy surpasses his is Mohammed Ali ... and honestly I think its close. (I think 15 years ago Ali wins the ""greatest legacy"" prize running away. I think now it's much, much closer. Bill was out of the public eye there for a while. But boxing has fallen largely out of the public consciousness and now Bill is on our TV every June with the best players of the day talking about how great and important he is.)

All of his teammates, and nearly everybody else in the league declared him the greatest of his era despite him not being statistically dominant. I mean, how rare is that? Even today, with all we know about the game, all the advanced metrics, you still frequently see players making the case for the raw stats guy. In his day, nope, everybody was like, ""That guy. He's the best.""

So when we talk about Russell's legacy being hurt, I'm kind of like, what? What would an un-injured legacy look like for him?"
5787,2020-10-30 16:35:13,jkvml0,"Good to see Bill Simmons participating in this subreddit lmao

Jokes aside, I agree with most everything you posted. I think the most telling argument in favor of Russell as a potential GOAT is that in the season where Wilt averaged a 50/25, Oscar averaged a triple double, and Baylor averaged like a 36-18-4 (estimating here, can‚Äôt be bothered to look up the exact stats lol) while only playing part-time, never practicing and flying coach 4 hours from his military base in order to attend games..... Russell still was voted (by his peers) as the MVP in a landslide. Speaks volumes to how much everyone else in that era regarded him"
5788,2020-10-30 16:45:16,jkvml0,"FWIW I don‚Äôt like how the ‚Äúamount of teams‚Äù argument is used. They still played an insane amount of games. For example, there‚Äôs one year where the league had 9 teams, but you played 80 games. You played 10 games *against every other team* ***before playoffs***. You learn a lot about another team in even just a 4 game divisional series. Imagine multiplying that by 2.5 before even getting to the playoffs. Teams knew what you were gonna do and you just had to overpower them."
5789,2020-10-30 17:11:28,jkvml0,"The two big items working against him are:

1. Few modern fans are old enough to have watched those title wins.
2. The footage of Russell's era shows a very different game with unimpressive athleticism and skills.

I don't think anyone would rate him differently if there was an extra trophy he kept winning because he still would have won it during an era that few modern fans remember or care about."
5790,2020-10-30 22:05:15,jkvml0,"No three point shot so not comparable leagues to be honest. There was also a vast difference in rules compared to today‚Äôs NBA‚Äôs. I personally do not include Bill or Wilt in the all time discussion. As others have said, the league was also much weaker and much smaller than today‚Äôs NBA. This isn‚Äôt Bill‚Äôs fault but it is true nonetheless. Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain played a different sport basically."
5791,2020-10-31 13:56:32,jkvml0,"A little late.  

Most of these GOAT arguments (like political debates) are posteriori.  That is one already has an opinion/choice and then picks and chooses reasons support the claim. And worse make convoluted arguments to discount other claims.

What hurts Russell's legacy more is *media*.  From Dr. J to Magic to Jordan to Kobe to LeBron, these players were media savvy, charismatic and cultivated media contacts.  Look at LeBron's comments after the MVP vote.  He was not disappointed that he lost but he was disappointed that so few media members voted for him. He expected more votes.  Even when LeBron loses there are more articles written about him.

Back in the 70's and early 80's, Wilt was the consensus  best of all time and the '67 76ers as the best team (competition was the '71 Lakers). Wilt was more media friendly and had a larger media presence on tv shows and promoting professional volleyball.

Russell had more of an antagonistic relationship with the Boston media.  Russell was willing to ""rock the boat"" on social issues. This made him a hot potato that certain elements of the media did not want to touch or discuss. 

Outside of Bill Simmons, there is no one in the media with an interest in pushing Russell in the GOAT discussion.  The media had an interest in pushing/promoting Jordan, then Kobe and now LeBron.  Like Russell, no one has an interest in pushing Duncan or even Kareem."
5792,2020-10-30 16:50:08,jkvml0,"Bill Russell's legacy is only harmed by two things: the fact that he played in the '60s, and that his scoring numbers aren't that impressive. It's not really about the accolades, because there's nobody in the league with more impressive accolades than ""five MVPs and eleven rings""."
5793,2020-10-30 20:50:24,jkvml0,"> Is Bill Russell's legacy perhaps hurt unfairly by the fact that there wasn't a Finals MVP trophy when he was playing? 

Yes. I mean... well duh, a bunch of more awards would help his cause for GOAT status.

The GOAT debate was never about the player, but it is about criteria that is totally made-up from whomever that is doing the GOAT judging. Jordan is generally considered the GOAT because he met many of those criteria. A bunch of rings, check. A bunch of awards, check. A bunch of records, check.

But there is no actual GOAT as a player. They are just the GOAT of their eras.

1950-60 Mikan

1960-70 Russell

1970-80 Kareem

1980-90 Magic or Bird, this you can debate.

1990-00 Jordan

2000-10 Kobe or Duncan, this you can debate.

2010-20 LeBron"
5794,2020-10-30 15:44:14,jkvml0,"Yes there are a few things that hurt Bill Russell's legacy: some fair and some not. The main criticism is the number of teams. Winning that many rings is a lot easier with 8-10 teams than 30. It's like making the conference finals now (which is still impressive to do 11 times).

The unfair is just that it was so long ago and some things were missing. Leading the list in Finals MVPs certainly would not hurt his legacy. But the bigger one is data. If we had more video and especially player tracking data we could really quantify just how good he is. As it is we have to guess from anecdotes."
5795,2020-10-30 19:21:29,jkvml0,"Given that the award is named after him I imagine he would have won a lot of them

1969 is the only chance he had and he lost it to Jerry West and John Havlicek would have probably won it over him anyway

Outside of that he probably would have won 10 FMVP‚Äôs"
5796,2020-10-31 00:36:28,jkvml0,"Whenever I create an all time team, Russell or Kareem always end up at C, with the other begrudgingly left off.

When Simmons put him 2 in his pyramid, I initially laughed it off as blatant homer-ism. And while I'd probably rather have Jordan, LeBron, and Kareem over Russell in an all time create a team draft, Russell is a top 5-10 NBA player of all time without question.

The dude was one of the best jumpers of all time and incredibly fast. Can you imagine him running the PnR as the lob threat with Harden or Steph? How about as the 5 on the current Lakers moving AD to the 4. Those lineups would be insane. He's probably the best defender and rebounder of all time."
5797,2020-10-31 04:33:37,jkvml0,"If anything, Russell's legacy benefits from the FMVP not existing.  Because he won 11 rings and the award is named after him, when it comes up people just assume he was the best player in the Finals every year.  If the FMVP existed and he only won, say, four of them, it might actually be perceived as a downgrade."
5798,2020-10-30 17:19:00,jkvml0,"I think Bill is impossible to rate simply because of when he played. Most people rate him top 5 or top 10 which seems fair. Realistically, I think he can never be the GOAT in the same way a baseball player from 1860 can't be the GOAT. The game is just too nascent.

For example, the beginning years of when the NBA started had no teams outside the northeastern/midwestern United States. There were no southern teams and no western teams. The league included teams from Rochester and Fort Wayne. Everyone shot less than 40% from the field. 

[https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA\_1957.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1957.html)

Prominent college basketball programs like Kentucky wouldn't play black players until 1969, the same year Bill retired. Simply put: the game wasn't what it is today. 

This isn't a criticism of Russell, who had to overcome racism to play, and who can't be blamed for the league not being developed. But it also means he can't be the GOAT."
5799,2020-10-30 14:43:17,jkvml0,"His legacy isn't hurt by a damn thing besides age.  Young fans simply have no appreciation for sports history - it's not just the NBA.  Go read literally any thread on r/nfl on the greatest QB's of all time or whatever, and count how scarcely few posts include guys like Otto Graham or Sammy Baugh.  Tons of ""Here's my top 10 all-time QB's, 8 of them played in the last decade"" types of posts.

Even as late as the mid-90's the ""GOAT"" discussion was still generally dominated by Bill and Wilt, with the occasional Kareem truther mixed in.  It wasn't until Jordan's last 3 titles that the conversation really started to steer towards him rather undeniably.

Yet now you see Top 5 lists all the time that don't include Russell, which is insanity.  Kids today..."
5800,2020-10-30 15:45:57,jkvml0,"I meeeeaaaaan, when the dude has the mvp trophy named after him, when he won 11 finals 8 in a row, 2 in a row as a player manager, brought up pretty much nobodies and turned them into hall of famers, champions, and winners, I would have to say.... no, bills legacy is stronger than anyone else's IMO

5801,2020-10-30 16:48:20,jkvml0,"The only argument against Bill Russell that I personally take to heart is the era he played in. He's one of the pillars of the game, upon which it's built, but his individual skill level has been so obviously eclipsed in the decades since he played that the whole ""11 rings"" thing loses its edge. You can call him the greatest winner ever. He won 11 rings as the undisputed leader of that team. All due respect to him. 

But there were, what, 10 teams when Bill Russell played? Some seasons, 8? The odds of winning a championship, just simple numbers, go way up when you cut the league by 2/3 or 3/4. And it's not like the NBA was bristling with talent, either. There wasn't exactly parity to the point where each of those teams were stuffed with All-Star caliber players. It was pretty concentrated into a few of those teams, and most of the talent revolved around Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain (one of the reasons that Russell, to me, is higher on the ""GOAT"" list than Chamberlain is because Wilt was kind of a loser and possibly the worst teammate ever). Equally talented teams were legitimate threats to those Celtics units, to the point where Russell-led teams were very beatable if all other things were equal and it was Russell vs another star as being the deciding factor."
5802,2020-10-30 15:35:11,jkvml0,"I've got Bill (along with MJ, Kareem, and Wilt) as the guys competing for GOAT, in that if you want to tell me one of those four is the GOAT and I will agree with you.

Now, when I've made this statement before the two names that grind everyone's gears are Bill and Wilt, because of the era they played in, which I think is a bullshit argument anyway.

One of the knocks from filthy casuals is the lack of FMVP awards relative to MJ or Kareem. That said, the award itself is named after him. However, with *that* being said, we do have to point out that Russell lost the inaugural FMVP award to Jerry West so we cannot say he would have won 11 FMVP awards for his 11 rings."
5803,2020-10-30 16:31:01,jkvml0,"i mean.. this is cute and all and i think we can all agree that hes a legend and backbone of those teams, but the dude played in an era thats not even remotely on the same playing field as today or a decade ago or even two decades ago. theres only 8 teams in the league filled with a very small sample size of talent. I know the argument of ""well since theres only 8 teams that means every player was like an all star and the talent is less diluted so the league was   
 tougher."" shut up. Hes still a 6-9 athletic and defensive freak and would still play in todays nba but i mean come on. he averaged like 12 points during ""the fastest era in basketball"" and would become like your fourth tallest player maybe. 

so to answer the question no. all the trophies and finals mvps wont negate the fact that his era (for better or worse depending on who you are) is just so different. but that doesnt negate his greatness or legacy. its just different.  and there was 8 teams. and the talent pool is significantly smaller and isolated to predominately white Americans back then. and the training, conditioning, and recovery knowledge is leaps and bounds greater than it was in his day. and guys are just better faster and stronger than they were 60 years ago. hahaha theres a lot of reasons"
5804,2020-10-30 20:14:38,jkvml0,"If you look at footage it's like they're playing with a peach basket for the hoop. They had 9 teams in the league. They had 8 Hall of Famers. 

Dominating Wilt with a team full of the best was great, but let's see him drag Walton and Lanier up and down the court the rest of the week. Or Olajuwon and David Robinson on a back 2 back. 

Those kind of scenarios didn't happen. So it's just not even a good debate to have. I'd rather talk about Kareem vs LeBron."
5805,2020-10-30 14:33:40,jkvml0,"Yeah, and that seems fair enough to me. If 40 years from now something like, say, Lacrosse is the most popular sport in America and the MLL the most viewed league, it's hard to fault future fans for discounting today's MLL greats."
5806,2020-10-30 14:12:51,jkvml0,"The average talent level of his teammates was not comparable to that of the modern era of basketball either. He still had to consistently beat Oscar, Wilt, and West/Baylor (once he beat all 4 in the same year) to win the Finals.

u/KagsTheOneAndOnly since this isn't a top level response and I don't want to be all over this thread I'm @ing you but the real thing holding back his legacy is the lack of DPOY awards and block/steal tracking. If Russell had 13 DPOY awards (a strong possibility) and averaged 8 bpg for his career (also a strong possibility) you'd have a lot more people that respect his 11 rings and consider him a legitimate GOAT candidate."

If for no other reason than voter fatigue, I think he ends up losing 2-4 of them to his teammates. And that is an incredible stat, but I would argue that right now people treat him as though he was the Finals MVP in every Finals he played in. Like the award didn't exist but we think back on him as being the best player on the best team for a full decade (rightfully so imo). If the award exists and he loses a couple, all of a sudden you'll get ""he won 10 but Heinsohn or Cousy were the guys for the first couple and Havelick was the Finals MVP for the last 2"" (or something to that effect)."

With all due respect to Rudy and Ben and their immense defensive abilities, they're not Bill Russell, and their impact on [dominating in the playoffs consistently for over a decade](https://backpicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/All-Time-Big-Men-PS-Defense-1024x621.png) don't really come close to him

Anthony Davis had [Finals MVP-worthy *impact*](https://mikeprada.substack.com/p/the-new-standard-brow-er) in several 2020 Finals games (especially game 6) based off his defense **alone** --- when AD was limited by foul trouble and injury respectively in games 3 and 5, Miami's offense roared to life and Butler had [two of the finest non-LeBron/MJ Finals games perhaps ever](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/jf4bzg/jimmy_butler_has_2_of_the_3_best_finals/)); I think it's certainly possible for Bill Russell to have legitimate high-level MVP impact in a more crowded offensive era missing a 3-point line

I fully agree that without many granular defensive metrics present in Russell's time, it's hard to fully quantify just how impactful on that end he was, but I think Ben Taylor's done as good a job as anyone else trying to do so, and the conclusion he arrived at was that Russell had easily one of the 5 most successful careers in NBA history, one that was engineered primary by his defense

I *also* agree that it's hard for fans (myself very much included) to wrap their heads around how someone could possibly be as impactful on defense as Russell's Celtics were... I would simply suggest reading [Russell's Backpicks GOAT profile again](https://backpicks.com/2018/04/02/backpicks-goat-3-bill-russell/)  ---   Ben Taylor does a much better job detailing Russell's excellence than I ever could, combining film, statistics, and prose

5820,2020-10-30 21:02:36,jkvml0,"> Modern fans just have a hard time appreciating a player who was primarily a star on defense

A bit unrelated, but my big theory about this and the biggest/smartest direction the league could take is to start educating the fans about the game during the game. I'd argue that 75% of all nba fans don't understand defense well enough to enjoy it, and a part of it is that there just isn't a good way to learn the game as you watch it like there is in the NFL or MLB. 

The nba/tnt/espn/abc etc. should start using timeouts/reviews/any other stoppage time to breakdown plays, defensively and offensively, to start getting people interested in the games more. At a minimum, it's more interesting than listening to how the NBA was better in the past"
5821,2020-10-30 16:13:55,jkvml0,nice post.
5822,2020-10-30 16:57:48,jkvml0,"And without the salary cap, draft system, and extreme player movement intrinsic to today's game, they could keep a dynasty together for longer and hoard talent."
5823,2020-10-30 23:59:01,jkvml0,"How many teams have a realistic chance to win it all now a days in this fair and balanced league? 3-4? When the Warriors played it was seen as a cavs vs dubs thing, even before they got KD.

This year it was Lakers, Clippers and maybe Nuggets as a 3rd in the west, especially after they dropped LAC, in the East it was Boston, Raptors maybe and Miami after the bubble started.

Talent being what it was, fewer teams meant a higher concentration of talent, countered by a smaller pool of said talent (mainly US players), what you said of the Celtics having better players overall is one of the points countered in the post, they didn't, they had around the same amount of all stars than Wilt's teams, the main rivals, and even when everyone but Russell would get injured, the team performance wouldn't drop and sometimes it would even improve without Cousy, both Jones, Heinsohn.

5824,2020-10-30 18:23:30,jkvml0,Wilt is easy to take out of the GOAT convo because he didn't maintain his regular season performances in the playoffs (hence only 2 championships).

5828,2020-10-30 13:06:05,jkvml0,"I think not considering Russel an all time great is a mistake. He would have been successful in any era, and the competition back then was fine. The smaller league helped to concentrate talent so even though there was less of it, you still ended up with all the best guys on a few teams. This isn‚Äôt to say those teams would win in a game today, the rules were very different, but rather merely dismissing his success as a quirk of his era doesn‚Äôt make that much sense to me. If being that successful was so easy, why couldn‚Äôt anyone else do it?"
5829,2020-10-30 13:19:03,jkvml0,"If you dropped Curry, KD and Duncan into the 50s or 60s, their injuries would have ended their careers very early (nearly instantly in the case of Curry and Duncan) because you they didn't have the same surgeries back then. Durability was a huge concern back then which is not nearly as relevant today, but many of the modern stars couldn't have made it.

Without the 3 ball many of those players also would've been significantly less effective, and especially Duncan would be pretty ineffective considering his size and mobility compared to the big men of that era.

These arguments are not as simple as people make them out to be. It would be very hard to predict exactly how anyone would turn out dropped in a different era and its not like we're ever going to know. So you have to compare based on how people competed based on the competition they were given."

5831,2020-10-30 14:05:40,jkvml0,"If you dropped modern players into the 1960s NBA, especially steph, I don‚Äôt think they would be nearly as good. There was no three point line until 1979 so steph and harden would be taking largely bad shots with no upside. The league was also much more focused on big men and post play which most modern big aren‚Äôt great at because it‚Äôs just not necessary in today‚Äôs game. The rules were also super different including the dribbling and traveling rules which would kill the effective of players like Harden, steph, and kyrie. And that‚Äôs not to mention the injury concern. The medical procedures that let athletes bounce back from severe injuries today were way less prominent and the facility and faculty that help players recover today were limited. There are definitely players that would dominate in any time, Lebron and Jordan mainly, but the game has changed so much that it‚Äôs nearly incomparable. Russle in today‚Äôs league would still be spectacular, not as great as he was in the 60s though. In my mind, he‚Äôd fill the role of a much better Rudy Gobert. He was insanely athletic and fast and is one of the best defensive players to play the game. His scoring would go down because of the games focus shifting from the post but with modern training that would go back up. I could see him averaging 15 points 16 boards and 2 or 3 assists in todays game and 2.5 to 3 bpg to go along with 1 or 2 steams per game. With the training that players have today, Russell would still be one of the better players in today‚Äôs league."

Would he actually have 8 FMVPs?

In '57, it probably goes to Tom Heinsohn who had a great series and a monster game 7 performance in a 2 point victory. Then in '59, Bill averaged 9 PPG on an abysmal 31% shooting. It would probably go to Heinshon or Cousy. 

'60, '61, and '62 would probably go to Russell.

'63 would go to Wilt assuming they were still okay with giving it to the losing team. Otherwise I could still see Sam Jones getting it over Russell. 

'64 and '65 goes to Russell again. 

'67 goes to West if they're fine with giving it to the losing team. Otherwise it should be going to Havlicek over Russell. 

There were 5 years he should have definitely gotten the FMVP. And that's not including voter fatigue. I don't see him winning 8."
5836,2020-10-30 17:27:58,jkvml0,"Thanks. I also enjoy Ben Taylor‚Äôs analysis. That said, it still think Bill Russell was playing like he had a cheat code because few people understood what he was doing or were willing to commit to doing the same.  By the way, Russell‚Äôs college and pro teammate and fellow Hall of Famer K.C. Johnson had the same cheat code on the perimeter, and has some of the worst offensive stats in the Hall of Fame.

But if Russell grew up today with his incredible basketball IQ and world-class athleticism, perhaps he would find a completely different cheat code.  I feel like the very best players would find a way to win in any era, it might just be a different way.

Tim Duncan is a good example of a superstar who found different ways to be great as the rules changed and as his body changed.  He started as a back-to-the basket low post player who got the ball at the start of nearly every play.  When the zone became legal he started playing more at the high post on offense and focusing on defense.  

Then when the NBA opened up perimeter offense Duncan graciously allowed Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili to initiate the offense while he set screens and became the second option in an equal-opportunity offense.  In his mid to late 30s Duncan continued to anchor the defense with intelligence and anticipation even as his athleticism faded.

Duncan is widely considered the greatest power forward in history, but the truth is he played center or power forward, low post or high post, pick and roll or pick and pop, offensive facilitator or defensive anchor with equal facility.  Like Russell, Duncan would do anything to win without worrying about stats.  I would not be surprised if Bill Russell showed equal adaptability in a different era.

By the way, I have seen an analysis claiming the Spurs‚Äô record during Tim Duncan‚Äôs 19-year career, in which they never missed the playoffs and won five championships, is just as impressive as the Celtics‚Äô record during Bill Russell‚Äôs career, because there were so many more teams during Duncan‚Äôs era, and so many more postseason games. I‚Äôve also seen an analysis saying Dennis Rodman was a better rebounder than Russell or Chamberlain, just because there were so many fewer shot attempts and missed shots in Rodman‚Äôs era."
5837,2020-10-30 19:07:14,jkvml0,"Yeah, that's a great point. If Bill Russell had played in a more modern incarnation of the NBA, he wouldn't have gotten close to 11 rings. No way. And no disrespect to him, it's just a very different league than it was when he played. I think he has the mentality and skill to have been a great player in any era, and win in any era, but you can't compare his championships to the players who are more often in the GOAT conversation today in a serious, apples to apples comparison..."
5838,2020-10-31 01:14:32,jkvml0,">It's almost as if you didn't read or open any of the links provided.

If you've read the Book of Basketball or listened to Bill Simmons' podcast on the topic, you're well aware of all the content in these links. It's nothing new, son. None of this post is new information. The thing is, stuff like ""Wilt played with just as good of teams"" isn't even really true. That's been debunked:

https://www.basketball-reference.com/blog/index4f3e.html?p=4229

>How many teams have a realistic chance to win it all now a days in this fair and balanced league? 3-4?

Well, that's more than 1, but let's not act like things don't happen. Who had the Raptors winning last year? Who had the Warriors winning in '15? Who had the Mavericks winning in '11 or the Spurs' resurgence in '13? Who had the Heat even making it to the Finals this year? The past 30 years, we've seen back to back Finals wins from teams a handfull of times. Since 2002, 10 different organizations have won championships. That's as many teams as Bill Russell ever even played against in a season, if memory serves...

If that 18 year stretch seems unfair because Bill only played 14 seasons, well the past 14 seasons have yielded 8 different teams winning championships, which is also as many teams at was in the NBA in stretches of Bill's career.

So guess again. Yeah, there's been more parity in terms of talented teams **since** Bill's era than there ever was **during** Bill's era.

>fewer teams meant a higher concentration of talent

Except it didn't... ""Talent"" is a relative statement, but Bill Russell was an overpowering CENTER at 6'10"" 215lbs. He couldn't contain Wilt, maybe made some plays and Wilt didn't look AS dominant against him as he did against other, pretty much shorter players on the whole, but you really think Bill Russell could match up against Hakeem or Shaq or Kareem? Because I don't buy that for a second...

The average level of talent in Bill's era as comparable to today or even 30 years ago isn't particularly close."
5839,2020-10-30 18:45:48,jkvml0,"My thinking goes: Kareem had the greatest individual accomplishments over a long career, Bill Russell had the greatest team accomplishments, Jordan had the greatest individual accomplishments over a short career, Wilt Chamberlain had the greatest individual accomplishments over a game or a single season.

I cannot come up with a 5th one of those measurements; long career individual totals (Kareem), short career individual totals (Jordan), team career totals (Russell), individual career averages (Wilt) but I'm certainly open to options.

I won't argue too much that Wilt doesn't deserve it anymore than I'd argue against Kareem or Russell not deserving it for whatever detractions you can come up with in *other* areas than the paths above because you're right and it's precisely that thinking that makes MJ the GOAT.

But in order to account for what might be personal bias growing up in the Chicago metro area in the 90s, I'll entertain suggestions for the other 3 to contend for greatest to ever play the game on the merits described above.

[As for Chamberlain himself, just looked at his stats and they speak for themselves.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/chambwi01.html)

But then remind yourself that blocks and steals were not official stats throughout his entire career. But it's not [inconceivable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3sLhnDJJn0) he averaged a triple double one of those years with blocks. Of the available data, which is suspect, [it's calculated he averaged 8.8 blocks per game during a 112 game stretch.](https://www.basketballnetwork.net/shot-block-data-exists-for-112-nba-games-wilt-chamberlain-played-in-and-shows-how-dominant-of-a-player-he-really-was/#:~:text=There%20is%20a%20Wilt%20Chamberlain's,unbelievable%20at%20the%20same%20time.)"

5841,2020-10-30 22:45:31,jkvml0,"There were only 8 for *part* of his era.

The league had shrunk to 8 teams before Russell was drafted, but had grown to 14 teams by the time he retired and didn't see a drop off in quality because there was plenty of talent trying to get on teams."
5842,2020-10-30 13:55:20,jkvml0,Excellent point. Modern sports medicine and nutrition is a major variable in these types of arguments. Even Jordan with his broken foot may have been treated differently from a medical standpoint in the 60s.

5846,2020-10-31 05:06:23,jkvml0,"You skipped a championship and starting at ‚Äò63 you were a year off, but I think I know what you meant.

I think we agree that in the 60, 61, 62, 63, 65, & 66 finals he was definitely the standout *(correct me if I‚Äôm wrong)*. That‚Äôs *6* so far.

I just don‚Äôt see any way the player on the losing team can win finals MVP without at least taking it to 7 games. Jerry West, who is in my opinion the rightful MVP of the 1969 finals, I believe was voted before the series was over. I don‚Äôt see Wilt or West winning for the other finals; Baylor is the only one who I think would‚Äôve had an argument if it weren‚Äôt for Russell‚Äôs incredible performance.

**1968 finals:**

You have to remember, at this point Bill Russell was the dark-skinned player-coach in his 2nd year replacing Red friggin‚Äô Auerbach, had just led his team through the only 3‚Äì1 comeback in history against arguably the greatest team of all time *(who admittedly did face injury)*, and while Havlicek was seen as having proven himself a superstar the performance that won the most praised was easily Russell (*especially by Jerry West)*. His accomplishments were all the rage and made sensational headlines.

*‚ÄùBill Russell, the very epitome of ability and victory in sport, and his Boston Celtics had won again.‚Äù* - Sports Illustrated, 1968

**1964 finals:**

Bill Russell played magnificent defense in game 1, holding Chamberlain to a mere *2 points* through the 2nd and 3rd quarters. Celtics won by 12.

Bill Russell and K.C. Jones were defensively agitating Chamberlain so bad in game 2, Wilt nearly got in a physical fight with Red Auerbach *(but the coach instead later orchestrated Wilt to get an a different fight)*. Celtics won by 23.

By game 5, Heinsohn was playing with a bandage over his eye. The Celtics up by 2 points with seconds to go, Russell jumped past Chamberlain to shove Tommy‚Äôs missed hook shot back in with the game-sealing dunk. Wilt was held below 30ppg for the first time in his career.

*I‚Äôm not saying Russell definitely would‚Äôve won FMVP in ‚Äò68 and ‚Äò64, but he was widely seen as the standout performer in both series and easily could have, bringing his hypothetical total to ‚Äú8‚Äú.*"
5847,2020-10-30 22:18:36,jkvml0,"Kareem had amazing team accomplishments, he carried Milwaukee to a title and was a part of the Lakers dynasty. Kareem is the undisputed goat which is why he doesn't come up. He's a conversation killer. He played in the 70s and 80s so we have footage and all our favorite 90s GOATS played in the 80s too. He has the stats, most career points. He has the longevity, the unstoppable offensive move and a great defensive game. There is no good argument against Kareem so the conversation got watered down to Jordan vs. Lebron. As a Ewing era Knicks fan...Lebron ain't got shit on Jordan."

5881,2020-11-13 15:14:07,ji2len,Hopefully this results in a better film than Creed 2. Don‚Äôt let Stallone make any decisions!
5882,2020-10-26 23:08:17,ji2len,"Agreed!  Once an actor has made a name for himself, he can ask for a director's role even though he has little training in directing.  His B.O. draw made up his lack of experience. Keep fingers crossed.  The first rocky was beautifully written and directed, can't say the rest of the series any better for it just copied from the original like you said."

5888,2020-11-12 18:08:11,ji2len,He deserves to be in the pantheon of great directors for this alone.
5889,2020-10-25 17:18:43,jhvtr2,Michael would be following in Sylvester Stallone's footsteps if he directs Creed III. Just like Stallone with Rocky II as well as the rest of the series until Creed.
5890,2020-10-25 16:28:18,jhvtr2,"I enjoyed the first Creed. It is the second best movie in the Rocky franchise/universe since the original Rocky. That said I don't see endless story potential here. Rocky was poor and fighting to change his fortunes (food on the table, start a family, etc).  As such watching movies about the way Rocky's life changed made sense. Creed is different. Creed came from money. The success Creed has doesn't change Creed's fortunes. Creed was fighting to be recognized as a Creed. That has already been achieved."

Very nice I excite"
5897,2020-10-25 00:15:48,jhj2aa,"Just throw the money at Coogler, the first one was a masterpiece."
5898,2020-10-25 00:31:07,jhj2aa,"My idea for Creed III. Apologies for the eyeballs of anyone who reads this in its entirety. 

 Act 1: Creed's unofficially retired. He's hung up his gloves on an indefinite break from competition. Drago is now the undisputed champion of the division. Spending time with his 4-year old son and supporting Tessa as her career hits the big time, Creed's getting comfortable on the sidelines of boxing as a trial coach to a former Olympic medalist in the heavyweight division(one level above Creed and Drago's light heavyweight division). Meanwhile, Rocky does return after all, and we can see he's very unwell and on the way out but Baby Creed's in denial about this. He takes his son to see Rocky 'Unk' Balboa often, and also takes him to the boxing gym too. Already it looks like Creed might be gearing his son up for a career in the ring, although this is only implicit and you can tell Tessa's not comfortable with the idea of her son following his father. From his sickbed, Rocky helps Creed with some coaching notes for the new protege and it looks like Creed is trying to convince himself that the journey he's on with his talented charge will inspire Rocky to another recovery. A match is set for the up and comer against a mid-heavyweight former champ who's at the tail end of his career, and if the kid wins the match he'll get to face the heavyweight champion for the belts. After the match is agreed, Creed's boxer is approached by a crime syndicate to throw the match in the 7th round. He's assured he'll still get the title fight even if he loses as the crime syndicate has infiltrated the WBO and gets final say on who features in the championship. The kid turns the deal down, and tells Creed about the offer. Days later, Tessa has a threatening encounter with some gang members outside her recording studio. This is reported to the cops and an investigation is begun into the match fixing attempt -we meet a youngish detective who's assigned to the case. At the end of Act 1, Creed's out of town for the big match in Seattle, which his player wins. The aforementioned title bout seems pretty much a formality. During the match, Tessa is back in Philly with Baby Creed Jr. at the bedside of Rocky. Rocky dies with the unfinished match playing on TV. Creed gets the news just as he's being interviewed on live TV after his prospect's won his fight."
5899,2020-10-25 00:45:53,jhj2aa,"I mean does it really need a third? Creed II was pretty much the perfect ending, not only to Creed, but to Rocky's story too."

5901,2020-10-25 00:47:29,jhj2aa,Yes awesome . Let‚Äôs pray we get a great finale

5922,2020-10-25 00:31:20,jhj2aa,"  

Act 2: Creed's feeling guilty about not realising how ill Rocky was, despite the fact Rocky wanted to shield him from the reality of it -Tessa reveals that Rocky's final words were essentially that he liked giving Creed something to believe in as he trained with his new prospect. Creed has a crisis of purpose when he realises Rocky indulged the recovery narrative just to help the momentum of the journey to another title bout. It's then revealed that Creed's boxer has been overlooked for the championship fight, and instead a lesser-known American talent has been chosen. This throws the boxing world into chaos as it seems like a terrible decision and fans, boxers, and commentators alike are up in arms about the decision. Creed goes on to formalise his retirement, stating he has no confidence in the WBO anymore and wants it to be disbanded or reformed from the outside in. He turns his attention to building a positive legacy in the sport that reaches beyond the romanticism of underdogs risking brain damage to win some leather. An idea crystallises for a standalone boxing organisation or event, and Creed eventually gets some promoters to help arrange a tournament for twentysomething boxers of the future. The proceeds will go to community projects in Philadelphia and beyond, and the fight broadcasts will be used to advertise various home grown charities, community outreach programs, and college opportunities. Tessa will debut her new album live at the beginning of the week-long event. Creed's own boxer will be the main draw, and another rising USA star is recruited too, and he wastes no time starting a war of words in the media about how Creed's fighter is overrated and out of his depth. The tournament will consist of a 5-round quarter-final, 5-round semi-final, and a 12-round finale. Headgear is mandatory in the first two rounds to promote safer boxing and also due to the tournament's short length. The winner of the final gets to fight a surprise former heavyweight champ at a later date in an event that will be similarly philanthropically minded. On the eve of the tournament, Creed's boxer is again threatened by the crime syndicate, but this time he's surrounded by three guys and is about to take a beating when Creed appears to bail him out. The young boxer is injured but agrees to fight in the tournament anyway, and loses the final to his smack-talking rival at the end of Act 2."

5928,2020-10-24 23:58:33,jhj2aa,"But if we get to creed 4 we might get to Adonis's equivalent to creed.

5934,2020-10-25 01:14:01,jhj2aa,I said the same thing about the first Creed. Them walking up the steps and looking out over the city was a great ending

5936,2020-10-25 01:09:17,jhj2aa,"Nah that's too harsh, the second one was still good and fleshed out a villian who was more of a cartoon in Rocky IV. Not to mention Rocky got a great ending."
5937,2020-10-25 00:31:40,jhj2aa,"Act 3: Creed is celebrated in the media for the positive role he's played with his successful event, although it's somewhat soured by his boxing prospect getting defeated. The detective continues to investigate the case of the attempted match fixing, and gets a lead that it's linked to a Russian organisation. Creed and Tessa have long since come to an agreement that their son will never get involved in boxing. Meanwhile, the title fight in the mid-heavyweight division goes ahead and suspicious betting patterns throw the whole championship bout into a derisory mire of suspicion. The WBO is creaking under the weight of criticism being sent its way. In the midst of all this, we find out that Creed has arranged for Viktor Drago to be the champ in Creed's upcoming event; the winner of his tournament is being rewarded a chance at Drago outside of the WBO. This means Drago will have to go up a weight class for the fight. A week beforehand, Creed thanks the Dragos in a somewhat frosty meeting at Rocky's cafe. The Dragos appear to be trying to improve their brand in America and that's why they've teamed up with Creed despite the problems it might cause with the WBO. But 48 hours before the Drago fight is to go ahead, Viktor withdraws which leaves the event in limbo. Because of all the charity commitments involved, Creed decides not to postpone and agrees to fight against the smack-talking egotist who defeated his protege in the tournament. Creed can make weight easily but he's only been doing some light sparring and keeping in basic shape the past 12 months and doesn't know how he'll perform. A practice round against his own fighter the day before goes badly, and Creed realises the fight will only be a battle to keep his pride and look good for his son who idolises him. It's fight night, and we're done hearing this young American blowhard spouting his shade at Creed and Creed's fighter. We desperately want Creed to win to put this guy in his place. Round 1 is a near bloodbath and Creed doesn't know whether he's coming or going as he returns to the corner. His opponent is backing up his talk. But then Round 2 is a non-event by comparison, and the vainglorious villain might not have the stamina for the 12 rounds. Creed goes on to send him stumbling in round 3, but his opponent stays on his feet. We then switch to our detective, who's cracked the case due to a source sending him leaked emails proving that Ivan Drago is a senior member of the crime syndicate. It's Drago who's been undermining the WBO all this time in a twisted quest for vengeance due to the hardship Drago suffered after losing to Rocky. The detective gets a warrant for Drago's arrest but just misses him at the airport as Drago returns home with Viktor. Back in the Creed fight, we're mid-round 4 and Creed gets spun by an uppercut; he briefly catches a familiar face in the crowd but then retreats to the ropes to soak up pressure until the bell rings. A cut on his face cleaned and glued, Creed looks back in the crowd and sees that the person he spotted is one of the gang members who tried to beat up his fighter earlier. Round 5 is a bit of cat and mouse before Round 6 comes around and Creed is only hanging on by a thread; his defence broken and seemingly about to get put out of his misery, his opponent starts pulling his punches and seems to allow Creed to recover by hitting Creed with some light body shots. Creed looks quizzically at his opponent at the end of the round, as if asking him why he didn't try to finish the job. It's clear something's up and that the guy Creed's facing is fighting strangely. Creed catches up as we reach round 10. The fighters get caught in a close up tussle and Creed says, 'Why are you playing with me? Finish it.' His opponent spits out, 'I can't. They'll kill me. End this.' Round 11's our endgame and Creed starts encouraging his opponent to bring his A game, finally realising that this seeming asshole has been terrified and in the grip of the crime syndicate's power all this time. Creed pushes him and pushes him to not throw the fight, and eventually Creed is knocked to the canvas having convinced his opponent to win. Afterwards, Creed makes sure the victor is safe in a dressing room. The police are notified of the syndicate's presence, and several of those involved are arrested in the stadium when the young boxer identifies them having known where they were during the fight. In the epilogue, the USA tries and fails to extradite Drago to put him on trial. Creed later receives a letter inviting him to fight Viktor Drago over in the Ukraine, but he lights the letter on fire in front of Tessa and his son."

^^^^^^^"
5948,2020-10-25 11:26:01,jhj2aa,"It's an unpopular stance to have, because it's still too soon and people think they are paying respect to Chadwick by saying nobody can replace him... but re-casting is definitely the choice they should make.  

No disrespect to Chadwick.   Great actor and an even better person.

I just think the T'Challa character is far too important both to the MCU and from a more broad cultural standpoint.  We've essentially only seen his origin and the character is set up to be an icon for a generation of kids as one of the leaders of the Avengers heading forward (especially with Cap and Iron-Man stepping aside).  I mean really, he's the first black superhero to really break through to a broad audience.  Kids of all races will be rocking his lunch box for the next decade with the way this is set up.   So I think it's important to continue his story and I'd argue it's disrespectful to Chadwick to just write out the character and ignore it after what he helped introduce to the world.  

Really, if they write out the character now and give the mantle to his sister (who is comic relief in the series), it just sort of undermines T'Challa and turns his story arc into one of the worst Black Panthers in their history.  All he's really accomplished at this point is gain the crown, immediately lose it, gain it back, get dusted for 5 years... and now people want to kill him off?  That's pathetic.    T'Challa deserves so much more than just being a footnote in Shuri's next 10 years of being the ""new Black Panther"".  Very quickly, her reign will outweigh his from a story standpoint.  It's a shame to just do T'Challa dirty like that given we're so early in his story arc.  

I also figure, we're at a place where we can have Spider-Man and Batman re-cast every couple years... living in an era where there are actually two currently active actors playing Bruce Wayne in movies and two active actors playing Joker in movies...   T'Challa IS Black Panther.  We should be able to watch this character continue.  There's a handful of actors I've seen suggested that would probably do a great job in the role.   

Gotta do it delicately and probably do it in a way that pays tribute to Chadwick.  Like, have a 5 minute segment before the movie showing the influence Chadwick had on the world.  Have inteview clips with the new actor saying how he wants to carry on that legacy.... and then continue T'Challa as intended.  

Ryan Coogler already spent a couple years finishing up the script for part 2.  It's ready.   I'd rather they continue this story as intended.  They definitely need to give it some appropriate time and probably do the announcement in conjunction with a statement from Chadwick's family about the character's legacy (you know, it's entirely possible Chadwick didn't want the character to die with him - knowing the cultural impact), but that's the direction that makes the most sense."
5949,2020-10-25 18:08:33,jhj2aa,"They arent the only person. I echo their sentiment. We all love Chadwick, but T'Challa doesn't end with him.

It's just far too soon for the world at large to think about that in any real way.

Once a year has passed, then we can start having reasonable discussions with who plays him next."
5950,2020-10-25 01:27:36,jhj2aa,"I definitely like the idea of the Dragos doubling-down in being evil assholes, almost like stand-ins for Russian oligarchs."
5951,2020-10-25 01:43:39,jhj2aa,"Yeah the bring them back in a bad blood sense does make sense, Dragos are Russian. For me me it would just seem like they are making Rocky 4 for a second time (Creed 2 and this persons idea for a 3rd)."
5952,2020-10-25 01:58:41,jhj2aa,"I hear what you‚Äôre saying with the Rocky IV rehash, but I wouldn‚Äôt really be against that rn. Tensions between Russia and the US have definitely been at their highest since the 80s, I guess it makes sense for our art to reflect that."
5953,2020-10-25 22:15:07,jhj2aa,True point many forms of art current and to come will reflect the tension of US and Russia. It would make the film more entertaining for that reason alone besides the (Creed/Rocky) branding.

5957,2020-10-25 01:04:44,jhgg7h,Do you ship to Europe (UK?)
5958,2020-10-25 13:41:40,jhgg7h,pm'd
5959,2020-10-25 01:17:34,jhgg7h,"I can, but I don‚Äôt know how much it would cost so let me know what you‚Äôre interested in and I‚Äôll go to the post office on Monday to check how much it would cost"
5960,2020-10-25 20:05:51,jhgg7h,Ah thx man was just wondering really. I can't afford it tbh!
5961,2020-10-25 02:33:11,jhfb23,Your post has been removed because this isn't a done deal. Both Collider and Deadline have updated their articles.
5962,2020-10-24 20:19:20,jhfb23,"Creed II seemed like a fitting end to the Rocky story so I wouldn't mind if he wasn't in this one 

Is this a bit of a risky move? Yes but I wouldn't put it past MBJ getting pointers from Coogler and Stallone over the last few years so I doubt they would allow him to do this if they didn't have confidence in his abilities. 

The last two movies were thoroughly entertaining so I will always look forward to another Creed."
5963,2020-10-24 20:46:26,jhfb23,Going the Sylvester Stallone route I see.
5964,2020-10-24 19:50:28,jhfb23,I would dislike to see them try and outdo every Creed sequel (remember how insane Rocky 4 was)
5965,2020-10-24 22:04:22,jhfb23,Will this be the end of Rocky Balboa? I assume they'll kill off Stallone in this one. I am cool with it though. Thought the franchise would have sputtered to a stop a long time ago (5 I'm looking at you) so it's actually great to see it morph into something else and continue.
5966,2020-10-24 20:06:31,jhfb23,"I wish he would‚Äôve chosen something a little different for his debut, but I can‚Äôt wait."
5967,2020-10-24 21:32:45,jhfb23,I hope Viktor Drago is in it getting a redemption arc or something.
5968,2020-10-24 21:57:08,jhfb23,"They‚Äôre going full Rocky with this series, aren‚Äôt they?"
5969,2020-10-24 19:57:05,jhfb23,"I don't like this. MBJ should cut his teeth on a smaller project before taking on something like this. Having his directorial debut on a bigger budgeted film like *Creed III* would be a problem, since he still needs to learn on the job."
5970,2020-10-24 23:09:06,jhfb23,"Have him fight Clubber Lang‚Äôs genetically engineered clone and we‚Äôre in business. Then in Creed 4, let‚Äôs have him fight on the moon!"
5971,2020-10-24 21:28:39,jhfb23,It's about damn time. I've been waiting to see what Michael can do as a director. This is a perfect opportunity.
5972,2020-10-24 21:00:21,jhfb23,Release date prediction - I think November 2022
5973,2020-10-24 21:08:43,jhfb23,good for him
5974,2020-10-24 22:57:45,jhfb23,I‚Äôve never been so indifferent to a headline before
5975,2020-10-24 20:49:01,jhfb23,This seems... risky
5976,2020-10-24 22:25:01,jhfb23,"I honestly didn't care for Creed II. The lack of Ryan Coogler was really sorely felt imo, the whole thing felt like a huge step down from the first one (which really didn't need a sequel to begin with)."
5977,2020-10-24 23:43:34,jhfb23,"I loved the first Creed really wish they hadn't made any sequels, especially without Coogler as I was very disappointed with the second one, mostly due to the weak directing and writing. Nevertheless it's ending wasn't that bad so I wouldn't mind if they just stopped there, but I guess I also don't mind seeing if they manage to at some point go out on a higher note than Creed 2, so whatever. Box office wise it'll probably do about the same as Creed 2."
5978,2020-10-25 01:06:22,jhfb23,"Good for him, I hope it turns out well.  I'm sure he will have guidance from the director of Creed 1."
5979,2020-10-25 02:23:54,jhfb23,Godspeed
5980,2020-10-24 20:17:50,jhfb23,Awesome
5981,2020-10-24 23:17:48,jhfb23,"Hell yea. Loved Creed 1 and 2... Heck loved most of the rocky films.

Wonder what 3 will be about? Revenge against Tony Bellew?"
5982,2020-10-24 23:24:37,jhfb23,That‚Äôs fine I guess. Creed 1 was fine. Creed 2 was mediocre. If it just doesn‚Äôt include Rocky I‚Äôm not super interested. Probably still has a good audience though
5983,2020-10-25 00:37:24,jhfb23,Not really a fan of Creed 2 but we'll see.
5984,2020-10-25 00:42:54,jhfb23,I need to see Creed II first...
5985,2020-10-24 22:16:34,jhfb23,I hope MBJ is still keeping the franchise alive in his 70's the way Stallone has. MBJ has done a great job and deserves to have the franchise passed to him.
5986,2020-10-25 01:09:05,jhfb23,The growth of Creed in these movies has funnily enough mirrored the ambition of Michael B Jordan.
5987,2020-10-25 01:42:07,jhfb23,"Every Rocky film, from the first one to Creed II, has been a fitting end to Rocky's story.  If there's one thing Stallone has got nailed it's writing good endings for Rocky."
5988,2020-10-25 00:08:00,jhfb23,"I‚Äôm thinking the revenge factor in this one will have to do with rockys death . Something similar to that other good boxing movie that came out in the last decade , where his wife got killed at a promo event"
5989,2020-10-25 02:11:43,jhfb23,I think they should kill off Rocky in Creed 3. MBJ is ready to take the reigns (and deserves it) but unless they legit get rid of Rocky entirely people will always want him to come back into the series
5990,2020-10-24 21:10:37,jhfb23,"By insane you mean amazingly awesome, right? I love Rocky 4."
5991,2020-10-24 22:25:49,jhfb23,Don‚Äôt you dare say anything bad about the most entertaining Rocky movie.
5992,2020-10-24 22:15:20,jhfb23,"Confirmed: Creed is now part of the Fast & Furious universe.

He‚Äôll be boxing with Dom in giant racing cars on the surface of the moon.  The winner will be crowned the champion of the moon"
5993,2020-10-24 23:54:21,jhfb23,"I would prefer if they just didn‚Äôt have him in the film but I guess there‚Äôs no good way to do that unless it started with his funeral or something

I thought Creed II was a perfect sendoff for the character"
5994,2020-10-25 01:48:18,jhfb23,Stallone has talked about killing off Rocky/Rambo in so many of these movies.  Somehow it never seems to happen.  I won't believe it until I actually see it on screen.
5995,2020-10-24 20:39:40,jhfb23,He's not working on a hundred mil blockbuster here lol. It's a mid-budget film and I'm sure he'll get some advice from Stallone if he needs it.
5996,2020-10-24 21:13:09,jhfb23,"I hate this logic and it‚Äôs what keeps Hollywood from finding new talent. If he can do it he should do it. Directing is about vision, the rest is logistics and he‚Äôs been in front of the camera enough to know how it works."
5997,2020-10-24 23:54:57,jhfb23,"Tell that to Bradley Cooper, his first movie was a similar sized feature which made hundreds of millions. There‚Äôs no reason to doubt MBJ here"
5998,2020-10-24 23:24:59,jhfb23,I love all the rocky's buy yeah creed 2 was definitely on the low end creed one was great
5999,2020-10-25 01:05:33,jhfb23,"Agree, the director for Creed 2 had only made one movie before and it was a little seen indie. Think he didn‚Äôt do too hot, maybe that‚Äôs why MBJ stepped in for the third."
6000,2020-10-25 00:37:47,jhfb23,"feel the same. Creed 1 was great, but Creed 2 lacked all the creativity and style Coogler added. MBJ is clearly dedicated and passionate about the character, hopefully that transitions to behind the camera too"
6001,2020-10-25 01:07:03,jhfb23,Also I'm hoping they end the Creed series with this one.
6002,2020-10-24 22:25:26,jhfb23,I fully support this.
6003,2020-10-25 00:11:07,jhfb23,So Rocky III. Makes sense. Creed 2 was basically Rockey IV Part 2. Creed 3 can be Rocky III Part 2
6004,2020-10-25 01:11:33,jhfb23,Southpaw? Pretty dope movie
6005,2020-10-25 00:39:13,jhfb23,something like rocky passes away and some high profile boxer claims that rocky was a terrible and over rated boxer and maybe bad mouthing adonis‚Äôs father would be a pree good movie idea maybe
6006,2020-10-24 21:12:16,jhfb23,"Rocky 4 was special because it was a natural progression for the Rocky series

Same thing for 5 and 6, it makes sense for those movies to be a bit chiller

If Creed tried to do the same thing it would probably feel forced and maybe even dull"
6007,2020-10-24 21:58:59,jhfb23,Happy birthday paulie
6008,2020-10-24 22:18:29,jhfb23,I've never met someone who likes the Rocky franchise but doesn't think Rocky 4 is fucking awesome.
6009,2020-10-24 23:12:17,jhfb23,my point is that if the Creed franchise went into a similar direction of constantly upping the anty it probably wouldn't work as well
6010,2020-10-25 00:11:29,jhfb23,And then the Bad Boys show up
6011,2020-10-25 00:04:35,jhfb23,"While I would definitely agree with you that it was a perfect sendoff, I can't see any of them not wanting to milk that story for all it's worth."
6012,2020-10-24 22:16:39,jhfb23,And Ryan Coogler will no doubt be giving him advice too
6013,2020-10-25 02:30:21,jhfb23,"Also its a boxing movie, one that he has been a part of since the start of the reboot. It's not some crazy cgi blockbuster, it's definitely going to be a challenge but if he's developed good relationships with the crew of the previous two I can totally see them putting their all into helping him where he needs."
6014,2020-10-25 02:14:13,jhfb23,"No, no, no. This dude has only been working in film and television since he was a child and has only experienced first hand every budget level imaginable, from indie up to $200M mega budget. Where would he ever have the background to assume he could direct a $40-60M picture?

Honestly, considering his filmography, a small level indie may be a movie least suited for him to make a directorial debut."
6015,2020-10-25 02:46:46,jhfb23,"Rocky ""V""! that was the fifth one, so rocky 5 plus rocky 2 equals rocky 7 Adrians revenge!"
6016,2020-10-25 01:25:00,jhfb23,Yup . Wasn‚Äôt expecting much but I got sucked in . Good flick
6017,2020-10-25 01:10:55,jhfb23,I watched them all recently and in 2020 rocky 4 is like a south park episode or something. And it's only 90 minutes or so. Like they rushed it out to cash in on the cold war. Rocky 5 sucks but I expected more from rocky 4 based on it's reputation. I really like Creed and Creed 2. I heard stallone say creed was over and they were planning some kind of tv series. I'm surprised and excited to see Creed 3!
6018,2020-10-25 01:37:41,jhfb23,It‚Äôs nice to meet you.
6019,2020-10-24 23:32:13,jhfb23,[deleted]
6020,2020-10-24 23:53:03,jhfb23,We already got Rocky 4 in Creed 2... it was awesome. I have full confidence.
6021,2020-10-24 23:38:45,jhfb23,Rocky 5?
6022,2020-10-25 00:11:52,jhfb23,Rocky 5 is by far the worst. Rocky III is just mediocre as hell
6023,2020-10-25 00:20:58,jhfb23,3 is meh but 5 is GARBAGE
6024,2020-10-25 18:02:05,jhfb23,"Its not for me, I will admit that Creed 2 did exceptionally well in certain areas;

Drago's redemption arc due to the mimicking of the ""stop the towel moment, this time it is Drago who made the right choice

Rocky and Ivan have a long history together and Ivan's life fell apart after Rocky 4, everyone's motivations make sense and it is wrapped up nicely"
6025,2020-10-25 01:39:17,jhfb23,No the Apollo heel to face turn is fantastic
6026,2020-10-24 20:22:04,jhfaqj,"Really hope he gets notes from Coogler. 2nd one, while fun lacked a lot of the personal touches that the first one did"
6027,2020-10-24 19:53:20,jhfaqj,Well I didn‚Äôt expect to read this today. Interesting news nonetheless
6028,2020-10-24 20:17:14,jhfaqj,The best part of this is knowing that Creed 3 is on track.
6029,2020-10-24 19:58:48,jhfaqj,"Dude is super smart and talented, a good vehicle for him. 

The Creed movies have been better than they should be"
6030,2020-10-24 20:56:36,jhfaqj,"That's a lot to take on for your first time directing, especially with how physically demanding it must be as the lead in a boxing film. But working so closely with Coogler and Stallone will put Jordan in good stead to tackle this from an experienced position. 

So how to shake up the formula? Creed was a shot in the arm for the boxing film genre, and Creed II was the comfort food follow up that was more predictable than Rocky II. Whatever they come up with, it's probably an idea to avoid another climactic triumph in the third act(be it the moral victory in Creed's draw or the comeback win in Creed II). But how do you subvert the formula without taking away what makes the Rocky series so popular? No idea, but there's a wealth of alternative boxing film plots to draw on, featuring rigged fights, self-destructive protagonists, fugitive war heroes, fighting tournaments, wrongfully imprisoned would-be champions, and paralysed contenders. I want them to take a chance on a risky concept and run with it. Creed II made enough money to give them that licence to mix things up."
6031,2020-10-24 21:42:57,jhfaqj,RIP to Apollo Creed.
6032,2020-10-24 20:22:06,jhfaqj,"I will always welcome more Rocky/Creed. I imagine MBJ has learnt a few things from both Coogler and Stallone over the last few years. They wouldn't give him this if they didn't have confidence in him.

Although I will say, if Rocky doesn't appear in this one I would be okay with that. Creed II felt like a good way to end his story."
6033,2020-10-24 20:33:38,jhfaqj,Thats awesome. Good to see him really take ownership of this franchise. Give me a dozen more.
6034,2020-10-24 20:28:36,jhfaqj,"I have long thought MBJ was following in the acting tradition of Keanu and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, both of whom have one feature-length directorial credit. So, this is perfect."
6035,2020-10-24 22:05:29,jhfaqj,"For a moment, my stupid brain thought: ""Hey, there is a Creed 1 and 2?! Creed from the Office has his own movies?"". Time to sleep."
6036,2020-10-24 22:08:18,jhfaqj,"No Coogler? 

...uh. Ok."
6037,2020-10-24 23:00:12,jhfaqj,Producer. Actor. Director. He‚Äôs full blown now.
6038,2020-10-24 21:05:02,jhfaqj,I hope this is good because Creed 2 was not a good movie.
6039,2020-10-24 20:35:19,jhfaqj,Wow okay.
6040,2020-10-24 21:25:22,jhfaqj,"What happened to wallace? 

He became a film director"
6041,2020-10-24 21:05:36,jhfaqj,damn his pecs tho
6042,2020-10-24 20:31:59,jhfaqj,"Yeah, it was a very forgettable movie overall. Bit nervous to see how he handles his directorial debut, but dude is talented so I have faith."
6043,2020-10-24 21:10:51,jhfaqj,Creed 2 felt like a 2hr long music video
6044,2020-10-24 22:39:11,jhfaqj,"I really liked the first one, it was surprisingly well done and was more a drama than a sports film. Haven‚Äôt watched the second but I heard it was kinda forgettable. Would you recommend it?"
6045,2020-10-24 21:03:41,jhfaqj,I was starting to get worried it would slowly turn into one of those movies I'd check up on once every year only to read interviews of Sly/MBJ insisting it's coming the following year until we just stop hearing about it.
6046,2020-10-24 20:56:47,jhfaqj,"I like that this feels like it fits with the themes of the movies too. Rocky has always been Sly's baby that propelled him to where he is and has largely been used as an allegory for his own life journey. In Creed 2 we officially ended off with Rocky handing the reigns over 100% by announcing his retirement, so not only will Creed be standing on his own during the film, but the character has officially become Michael B Jordan's baby as he's allowed to take full creative control of the character and narrative."
6047,2020-10-24 21:34:45,jhfaqj,"I remember thinking about this after seeing Creed II. I‚Äôm not sure how much I like the idea but it‚Äôs a thought I had.

They lingered on a shot of him icing his hands during a training montage. I don‚Äôt know if hand injuries are common among boxers. But given that his wife needs hearing aids and potentially his child might too, being able to learn/use sign-language could be very important for him to communicate with his family. So there could be some drama with him deciding whether he wants to continue boxing risking damaging his hands."
6048,2020-10-25 00:28:17,jhfaqj,[deleted]
6049,2020-10-24 21:02:31,jhfaqj,"I think we'll get Rocky, but it'll either be a situation where Rocky passes away or a short cameo ala Rocky V with Mick where it's one scene giving him some final advice. Creed II made it too clear that Rocky, and by extension in a way Sly, was fully handing the reigns over.

But at least if we do get more Rocky, it'll be because Michael wants him to be a central party of the story. I think I can live with that, as it'll be what Michael wants for his character this time around."
6050,2020-10-24 20:47:50,jhfaqj,[deleted]
6051,2020-10-24 20:29:55,jhfaqj,I think the difference here is Michael B Jordan and Keanu can actually act
6052,2020-10-24 20:39:27,jhfaqj,Stallone directed Rocky 2 and it turned out pretty good for his first time. We‚Äôll see
6053,2020-10-24 21:47:50,jhfaqj,Creed 3 is gonna feel like a two hour soap opera episode
6054,2020-10-24 21:48:59,jhfaqj,Lip reading exists
6055,2020-10-25 00:28:32,jhfaqj,[deleted]
6056,2020-10-24 20:55:09,jhfaqj,"Ryan Gosling did a movie. Jonah Hill too. Plenty have.
 Paul Dano was responsible for one of the better recent ones."
6057,2020-10-24 21:03:38,jhfaqj,Bradley Cooper is he directed a movie that got a Best Picture nomination. We can throw Jason Bateman in there he won an Emmy for Ozark.
6058,2020-10-24 20:33:38,jhfaqj,"Wow, the absolute disrespect to my main man JGL."
6059,2020-10-24 20:35:38,jhfaqj,"JGL tries hard and fails. Keanu knows his lane mostly. MBJ is in-between. They all have the potential to be physically magnetic, but you can see the wheels turn when they speak, particularly longer chunks of dialogue. In Fruitvale Station and Just Mercy, Jordan isn‚Äôt bad, but if you look at what Jamie Foxx or Rob Morgan or Melonie Diaz do, you see the difference."
6060,2020-10-24 20:41:05,jhfaqj,[deleted]
6061,2020-10-24 21:48:34,jhfaqj,I really liked Wildlife good performances all around. Dano found a child actor who looked like a younger version of himself.
6062,2020-10-24 20:38:14,jhfaqj,"I made a mistake, I meant to put him in there instead of Keanu. My bad. Joseph Gordon Levitt is a great actor"
6063,2020-10-24 20:37:08,jhfaqj,"Idk how I fucked that up lol, I meant JGL and MBJ can act. Keanu can‚Äôt. JGL tries hard and fails? Yeah, no way buddy"
6064,2020-10-24 21:35:49,jhfaqj,"Stallone also directed Rocky Balboa (2006), which is amazing."
6065,2020-10-24 20:40:37,jhfaqj,I was so confused.
6066,2020-10-24 20:39:31,jhfaqj,"Oh, I think JGL is really poor. He acts like a guy trying to take a poop while doing a Keanu impersonation. He‚Äôs not good at voices and brings a level of dim-wittedness to performances it does not call for.

The Matrix, Bill and Ted, the John Wick movies are Keanu‚Äôs lane."
6067,2020-10-24 21:42:54,jhfaqj,"He was originally supposed to direct Creed 2, and I do wish we had been able to see that version of the movie."
6068,2020-10-24 20:41:39,jhfaqj,"Keanu sucks. Great guy, but he‚Äôs by far the worst actor out of the three"
6069,2020-10-24 19:29:33,jheqsk,"I don't think this is good idea. The Creed II was perfect ending. Adonis leaving the belt at this father grave, and Rocky finally going to Robert and meeting his grandson, and Dragos found peace with eachother."

6071,2020-10-24 20:28:20,jheqsk,TIL creed is a Bond film!
6072,2020-10-24 20:23:40,jheqsk,"Y'all are haters, I have no problem with Creed going the way of Rocky and giving us fun movies even if they don't hit the emotional highs of the early films; the star taking over directing duties just furthers that connection."
6073,2020-10-24 19:14:59,jheqsk,"Hopefully by the time its filmed, full capacity crowds will be back. 

The green screen fight in Creed 2 has aged so poorly in only 2 years. It looks like a video game lmfao. Even the boxing scenes from earlier Rocky films in the 70s and 80s look more realistic."

6075,2020-10-24 21:11:49,jheqsk,"Michael B. Jordan is obviously confident that he has a grasp on the character. This is an ambitious move for him, but I'll be cheering him on. I'll be there on opening day expecting to be impressed."
6076,2020-10-24 21:10:57,jheqsk,Talk about burying the lede...
6077,2020-10-24 20:30:48,jheqsk,So inspiring and bold. What a move.
6078,2020-10-24 19:53:18,jheqsk,"I wouldn‚Äôt mind another. I may be in the minority, but I think they should use another movie to kill Rocky and end the franchise.

Also, it's an extremely flexible word that can be imbued with almost any meaning.

For instance, some time ago some guy made the news when he made a post saying he'd volunteer to go to the border and shoot anybody trying to cross it illegally. Now if you asked this person, they no doubt would agree ""murder is wrong"". But of course they'd have some sort of justification for why shooting people in that particular situation isn't murder. Presumably they either have no rights not being citizens, or they're breaking the law, or some such, and therefore in this particular case a person that has planned in advance to take a weapon, point it at another person across a country's border and kill them isn't really committing murder.

IMO using words like ""murder"" when discussing morality is highly misleading, first due to the ""true by definition"" issue, but more importantly because they're extremely fuzzily defined words that allow people to reach a false agreement. Pretty much everyone would agree ""we should do the right thing"", but such an agreement is meaningless because there are enormous disagreements on what constitutes the ""right thing""."

I don't think that it's possible to ""debate"" in the classic sense, as you've mostly just outlined the field, but let me provide my views (which I've recently posted elsewhere in this sub) as counterpoint:

Morality is a category, and I won't touch on that (other than this entire comment is within that category, contextually). Moral systems, on the other hand are hierarchical. The hierarchy is more or less:

* Good
* Values
* Virtue
* Moral system

Once we have a basis, a fundamental notion of the good, then we can proceed to construct values upon that foundation. Values are abstracts. Virtues are instantiated in agents. If we value freedom, then protecting others' freedom becomes a virtue. If we value truth then honesty becomes a virtue. etc.

Moral systems are negatives: they constrain behavior based on virtues. If we value freedom and consider protecting others' freedom to be a virtue then our moral system might require us to seek out and prevent obstructions to freedom.

There are moral absolutes that are evolutionary (e.g. we consider the protection of children to be an absolute moral good, and in the context of a evolution it is... but if our notion of the good is not rooted in anything related to evolution, then is protecting children even meaningful? What if stars are intelligent? Would they consider protecting human children to be meaningful? Should they? Does it make any sense to ask if they should?

So as a human, I hold that there are moral absolutes. But as an entity in the broadest sense, I have no such bias."

6110,2020-10-24 12:37:16,jh1qoq,"Nice post. One thing I wish were included:

There's a subset of philosophers somewhat aligned with emotivism who argue that realist moral language ('theft is wrong regardless of what I think') is justifiable on an emotivist or similar basis (eg by reference to my feelings about hypothetical scenarios where I have different attitudes). See Simon Blackburn, *Essays in Quasi-Realism* for further argument for this position. Alan Gibbard also defends this reasoning.

Arguments in its favor include *supervenience*: the fact that moral properties track (but aren't identical to) natural ones. In other words two identical situations (in all nonmoral respects) must also have identical moral properties. If moral properties were not constructed or projected but rather sensed in a similar way to our 5 senses, then we wouldn't expect them to covary with natural descriptions in this way."

For clarity's sake, Utilitarianism is a branch of Normative Ethics. You're talking about competing versions of Normativity, and so I wouldn't use the word ""meta"".

There are a few definitions of morality, and sometimes we mistakenly run them together. 

We have descriptive versions of ""morality"" where we just report what people, or cultures, believe the good and the right are. That's not really what I'm talking about. Instead I care if propositions like ""X is wrong"". I wanna know if ""X is wrong"" is ever true, and under what conditions it is true.

Let's take an example from the post: if we are a moral naturalist we probably think ""murder is morally wrong"" is true: we think that it is true in the same way that ""gravity is a force"" is true, or ""trees have bark"" is true. This position doesn't seem *only semantically different* from an Emotivism.

I disagree with this statement. 

If there's a situation in which placing a child before the greater good of the collective would result in the death of the collective it's not an absolute moral good, especially from the context of evolution, as the collective would perish.

>but if our notion of the good is not rooted in anything related to evolution, then is protecting children even meaningful?

Meaning is derived by our values, and being subjective it varies based on the perspective of the individual. To a father, saving their child may over-ride their sense of self-preservation, placing a greater meaning on the child than the parent's own safety. Whereas to a by-stander who knows nothing of the child or the parent, but has two children of their own, their personal safety would be valued far higher than the stranger's.

I don't see any version of this where there's any moral absolute.

I think the biggest issue morals have is that people inherently make this assumption that they're objective or absolute when all existing demonstration of morality is subjective."

Pretty much nobody here uses it that way. Christians obviously talk about whatever it is they understand ""thou shalt not murder"" means, and not whatever it says in the penal code. When murder is used as an example of something objectively wrong, I've never seen anybody to qualify that ""as defined in the legal code of Nicaragua"", because otherwise abortion may not be murder, and what exactly is ""murder"" depends on what legal code the reader is thinking of.

Pretty much everybody here uses ""murder"" as the name of a moral transgression, not a law in some unspecified country.

OTOH, protons are real, because they can exist independent of a mind to imagine them.

Morals are merely conventions accepted by a society.

Morality is 'imposed' by society on its members by punishments ranging from a 'tsk' to an 'honor-killing'.

I use the word 'utilitarianism' because if someone says ""That is wrong"" and I ask ""Why is it wrong?"", The answer may be a utilitarian statement, like ""people would be better off if no one did that"". 

""Utilitarianism"" is 'meta' because it isn't a moral rule in itself, but is used to justify moral rules.

So, I don't think my view fits into any of the pigeonholes you describe.

Perhaps I can more concisely claim: Morals are unprovable opinions to which a society enforces agreement. I would say that 'laws' are a more formalized and fully defined form of morality.

Sure. A lot of Christians think that the only way to get to moral realism is through God. I think they're mistaken.

But what does this have to do with murder being a bad example? It seems like it illuminates exactly what their realism entails.

But this doesn't seem to limit the example in the context I'm using it.

I think this is the case. Murder, as violation of the law, is not immoral unless you hold that violation of the law is immoral.

But murder as unjustified killing is always unjustified... I hold that unjustified acts are at least amoral if not immoral, and I might hold that they are always immoral except when they lack agency. For example, my heart keeps beating, not because of a moral decision, but because my autonomic nervous system maintains it and so there is no moral value present in the beating of my heart. But killing that is not accidental is, by definition, a choice and so a moral decision has been made. You might feel that the killing is justified (e.g. in self defense) but for any justification, you can find people who believe strongly that that justification is not valid.

Then there are killings that, while immoral, might not be subject to law. Star Trek: The Next Generation had a brilliant episode about this. >!An entity with god-like power had retaliated against an aggressor race who killed his mate by wiping out the entire race. Picard determined that such an extreme power differential between humans and this entity left him with no practical way to hold it accountable to their laws, which are predicated on human behavior, even though both he and the entity in question considered the act morally wrong.!< To quote the episode, >!No, no, no, no, no, you-you don't understand the scope of my crime. I didn't kill just one Husnock, or a hundred, or a thousand. I killed them all. All Husnock, everywhere. - Are 11,000 people worth... 50 billion? Is the love of a woman worth the destruction of an entire species?!< To which Picard responds >!We are not qualified to be your judges. We have no law to fit your crime.!< You can disagree with him. Many Star Trek fans did, but it's an interesting perspective: our laws are meant to govern our behavior. Do our laws have any basis at all outside of our own context?"
6154,2020-10-24 13:19:42,jh1qoq,"> So it seems like we're in agreement, and that your example of the man 'defending' the border fails to be a problem case. They either misunderstand the axiom or don't believe it to be true.

I disagree, I think they both understand it, and believe it true. They just have their own, personal understanding of it, as does most anyone else, and so agreement only exists only so long you ignore the details of the actual positions and reduce them to their fuzziest form possible.

> But what does this have to do with murder being a bad example? It seems like it illuminates exactly what their realism entails.

That it's effectively meaningless. The word ""murder"" effectively unpacks ""whatever kind of killing I believe is wrong"", and therefore the statement ""murder is wrong"" resolves to ""whatever kind of killing I believe is wrong, is wrong"", making it a meaningless tautology.

I'm talking about this bit here: 

> (1) that the disagreement part of moral disagreement is heavily exaggerated. If we polled people what would they say their morals comprise? Presumably that theft is often bad, as is murder. They might emphasize the family; on happiness and on fairness. If we take these to be moral claims, then it seems there is widespread agreement! 

I see it as very misleading as there are actually very significant disagreements in such areas. For instance with murder we have:

* Abortion
* Self-defense -- is it okay in general?
* Self-defense -- how far can you go? Can you shoot a fleeing attacker in the back?
* Self-defense -- duty to retreat, castle doctrine, standing your ground?
* Proactive self-defense -- Can you kill before violence on you is initiated, if you feel threatened enough? How much is threatened enough?
* Retribution for killing -- Can you kill somebody who killed somebody you care about?
* Retribution for lesser offenses -- Can you kill somebody who raped your daughter?
* Retribution for dishonor -- Can you kill a family member for dishonoring your family?
* Law breaking -- Can you kill for breaking a law, such as crossing a border?
* Rule breaking -- Can you kill for breaking a non-legal rule, like if you told somebody ""If you do X, I'll kill you?""
* Offending God -- Can you kill for violating religious precepts?
* Non-persons -- Is anybody unprotected? Slaves, outlaws, foreigners, the wrong races, etc may have no rights.
* Politics -- Can you kill for political reasons?
* Euthanasia
* Withdrawing life support
* Probably more I'm forgetting.

Reddit is a place where it's easy to find every position possible on all of these. You'll find people who think killing an attacker should be a last resort, and people that just seem to be itching for somebody to give them a reason to kill them. The attitude of ""I'd kill somebody for hurting a family member"" is pretty common. The positions on euthanasia and abortion are varied. The attitude of ""the rules are clear, if you break them you do so at your peril"" is a pretty popular one in some circles. The idea that some politicians would be better off dead also has some representation.

If you got all of those into a single thread they'd superficially agree on ""murder is wrong"", then start a giant argument as soon as anybody started discussing the specifics.


> Can you explain to me why, specifically, ""murder is wrong"" isn't useful in showing the difference between a realism and an anti-realism?

I'm not really saying it in the context of ""realism and anti-realism"", more that the example itself is bad no matter the context."

I'm not referring ""all opinions"", but to 'Mere Opinion', ie, opinion totally devoid of evidentiary support.  Dr. Fauci's opinions are entitled to far more respect than those of the imbecile who denounces him/

If it's a 'fringe claim' that unsupported tendentious opinions are more than 'mere attitudes', then, so much the worse for the majority.

""Objective Morality"" is really just a stalking horse for conventional religion, and, at least in the West, the primitive customs of the bronze age societies from which it is derived.

I still prefer the term 'meta' because the criteria by which we judge moral rules are not themselves deontic. Utilitarianism is not a 'normative rule', but an invitation to think about the results of our actions.

I don't think my views are mere 'relativism', which, at least as I understand it, allows each individual to accept or reject moral rules.

The 'extra steps' are important, eg: determining reasonable meta-rules, using those to determine deontic rules, and having the majority of a society buy into them.

It's a 'Societal Subjectivity', which in that sense isn't as oxymoronic as it may sound."

I've never seen anybody deny it, actually.

Murder is such an universal concept that everybody uses it, just differently. For instance I can see both a moral realist and an emotivist make the statement ""murder is bad"", just one of them is thinking they're making a truth-apt statement, and the other is thinking ""ew, murder"", despite both of them expressing those different views in the exact same words.

Also, it's tautological regardless of one's personal views, as per definition. People who are okay with abortion never refer to it as for instance ""moral murder"", they just say that murder doesn't include abortion. People who think morality is subjective and situational instead would talk for instance of a honor killing as ""they don't think of it as murder, even though our society does"".

Which is why I still think it's a bad example to use, because the same words decode to entirely different meanings depending on who's speaking. If we want to usefully compare different moral systems and attitudes towards morality, we have to get down to the details."
6165,2020-10-26 02:35:41,jh1qoq,"> this post shows that there is evidence to support a moral realism.<

I'm afraid I missed that. Which post gives evidence to support moral realism?

Perhaps we have different ideas of what is 'real'.

Is a unicorn 'real', because an idea of a unicorn is real?

I use the word 'deontic' because, regardless of the nature of the Meta-moral rules, the resulting Moral rules are of the form ""Thou shalt not..."""

It's one of Reddits favorite mantras for whatever reason, but that reason isn't ""because it's true"". It is *not* always relevant, especially when it comes to matters of self expression, and saying so does this whole post a disservice. Knowing this was written with that in mind makes it difficult to take the whole thing seriously.  

This advice seems intended for new or developing writers, who I imagine are exactly the sort of people who should be encouraged to explore parts of themselves however they can. Writing is the appropriate outlet for that. They're comfortable here, because they sense in themselves something worth saying. If you want to be helpful, don't be yet another voice in the crowd telling them they're just like everyone else. Invalidating their experiences by assuming they're boring, because they don't live up to some nonexistent standard, because they aren't some kind of eccentric idea of a person isn't just discouraging, it's toxic. ""Reminding"" people that they're not special sets up unnecessary gates and standards, which no amount of writing advice is going to define. By stating that their experiences aren't worth exploring in the first place, you're kneecapping new writers at the start of the race.

Feel free to disagree, but I believe individuals *are* special, and insisting otherwise isn't just lazily dismissive of their personhood but of their potential as storytellers. It's one thing to occasionally remind ourselves to keep our heads out of our asses, but when you go out of your way to be that guy with the ""harsh truth"", I have to ask: it really about helping people, or justifying something else?  Dismissing someone's individuality mistakes humbling them with tamping down their potential. The issue isn't a matter of intention either, it's simply how some people are going to interpret it. Those interpretations are going stop potential writers from writing, and that sucks.

I'm honestly so tired of seeing it, ""you're not special"" is treated like some kind of all-encompassing sage advice when all it does is smugly impart a sense of shame on people who are just trying to find their voice, express themselves, and better their writing abilities. Interesting writing isn't just reserved for real life 'characters'. Everyone has something to say, and even if it isn't terribly exciting to *you*, what matters is they're reflecting, analyzing, criticizing, creating, writing, working. Discouraging people from believing their experiences are worth exploring  helps nobody. What does help is enabling writing without these weird boundaries, encouraging people to analyze what they know of themselves and their environment, of their life. That it's okay to do that alone, and it's okay to share it and see if anyone out there understands. It's simply untrue that writing is only valid once it's seen by an audience, or once someone has met some standard that doesn't actually exist. An audience is extremely helpful, it's encouraging, but if you think it's mandatory than it's time to hit the books and read up on the countless authors who went unnoticed their whole lives.

This is giving me vibes akin to ""entrepreneurs"" hustling every day to get their bugatti or whatever. I can only go over so many points without writing myself into a rampage so bear that in mind. 

First of all: Mark Manson? You're using *Mark Manson* as an example to make your pretentious and arrogant writing credible? This explains more than it should lmao.  


Step 1: Give yourself burnout  
Please don't force yourself to write everyday. Writing under self afflicted pressure makes your writing worse, additionally to the basically guaranteed burnout. You can write everyday if you're motivated enough to write everyday. If you're not, let it rest. It's not a race. 

Additionally, you're literally advising us to write through stream of conciousness. Don't think, just write? A few paragraphs down you declare that it sucks. Make up your mind.

Step 2: Become a projecting egomaniac and pride yourself with willful ignorance

As someone writing his thesis about Memoirs and Biography in Media, I can with absolute certainty and 100% commitment say that you have no goddamn, not even the slightest concept of an idea of what you're talking about. Reading this is borderline insulting. What you're doing is projecting. YOU don't care about what other people lived through, YOU think memoirs suck. There is a whole goddamn industry around bringing biography and memoirs to paper, from and by people no one has ever heard of. People writing stories literally get inspired by other people's biography. For god's sake, read up on the topics you're talking about. 

Furthermore - projecting. Do you know why Tolkien was so famous? Because he spent pages filling in details. People loved that shit. YOU don't like details. Go read a comic book. Fuck off with that. 

Step 3: tie your self worth to financial success to become a shell of a human being

Not everyone writes to be famous. People don't create art to be famous, but because they have to, it's a drive from inside compelling them to express themselves. You're handling a creative process like a stock broker. C'mon. 

Step 4: repeat step 3, add misinformation and contradict yourself

A nitpick, since history was part of my degree: common capital punishment ""in the old days"" was to be literally beheaded, they made a spectacle out of it. The executioner had to learn for years how to properly sever the head of the victim in one clean sweep. People lined up to get sprayed by blood for fuck's sake. The Executioner was cast out of the city if they didn't do their job right, but ""capital punishment"" was NOT exile.

Anyway. Your part about humans being social creatures and caring about what other people think clashes with your ""the inner workings of other people's minds are not interesting"" in a kind of hilarious way. You could argue that that's two different beats but reading the rest of your barf makes me wonder. Think before you speak.

Step 5: repeat step 3 and end with a sardonic smile

Being a writer is not about having something. The state of being x being bound to quasi-materialistic object y is mind-bogglingly naive. This is reading like you're being brainwashed by space maggots or something. 

Describing something is retrospective in nature. Much like you can't say you're \[insert political stance here\] and *then* behave like one you can't say you're a writer and t*hen* write.

I think it‚Äôs very important to developing one‚Äôs skill - more so than writing everyday. To draw comparison, writing every day without getting feedback is almost like doing math problems that don‚Äôt come with answers. Sure, you can do as many math problems as you want, but how do you know you‚Äôre doing them right if you don‚Äôt have answers to refer to?

For some writers, (like me), writing is an art. ""Writing just to write"" is like throwing paint on canvas just to waste paint and canvas. 

I write when I have a thought worth writing about. Because I know I write well. Writing also takes an emotional toll on me, so I spend those emotional spoons carefully on things that are worth it.

6234,2020-12-14 06:12:13,kcdg2j,This is literally what Steven Pressfield talks about but much more condescending
6235,2020-12-14 05:05:51,kcdg2j,"Pressfield's book The War of Art is the most toxic piece of writing advice I've ever come across, and is only seconded by Stephen King's.

There is no such thing as Resistance (or Satan) that is trying constantly to get you to not write or produce whatever your art is.

I'm not saying I disagree with all the specific advice, but the overall frame is so toxic and false, I don't think the good advice shines through enough. What I mean is, if you take his book to heart, you are setting yourself up to have a neurotic, toxic relationship to writing. I'm not saying you can't push through it and become successful  using its methods, as someone can be chased by a murderer and become more fit because of it (but eventually the thing you're running away from will be there to greet you, because you've creates this psychotic expectation that something is after you, trying to thwart your path, which simply isn't how writing works, unless you convince yourself that it is).

If you read Pressfield, please at least don't adopt his mindset. Use whatever techniques seem good to you. Writing definitely improves one's writing, and creates output, but the goal to write every day puts you on a surefire course to beating yourself up when you don't do it, and reaching a baseline when you do reach it, walking on the knife's edge of the all or nothing mentality of ""if you are a real writer you write everyday or else you are not a real writer.""

Sometimes what's good for real writers is to take some time to plot your book, to explore possibility without the arbitrary goal of writing every day. You will enjoy writing more by creating a healthier relationship to writing. If you write novels, read Save the Cat Writes a Novel. It teaches you how to outline a story. By creating a powerful story and understanding plot points that are coming up, you will receive automatic energy to write your story. No fear here. You will see where you want to go and be able to get there incrementally. And you'll really enjoy it, while Pressfield products will be riding the knife's edge of highs when you've kept your writing streak up and lows when you've fallen short of your misfounded goal. 

TLDR: If you are a writer: Do NOT write every day."

These are the words that Brandon Sanderson took away from his repeated failures of becoming published. He wanted to become a famous and successful author, so he moved towards that end. One day, after repeatedly failing to get published he decided to make a novel that would be published. Upon finishing it, he realized how much he hated it. He considers that story, the worst story he ever wrote and scrapped it without trying to get it published. 

He then went out and wrote his perfect novel. That novel was too long to ever be published and so, no one published it. He then made a decision to break the novel up and rewrite it has a 10 book series he is now writing called The Storm Light Archive."

I always feel impatient while reading something, but this time something miraculous happened. Anyways, the moral of the story is to know your favourite domain and write about that every day. Literally, every day. 

That's the problem with me. I actually want to become a writer but I'm thinking I don't have enough experience in a particular topic to write about every single day. And with the difficulty level, I found research difficult and after research on a topic, I don't think that voice will come naturally from me. 

What should I do? Should I write about something I don't know? And by writing every day, how can my writing improve if I won't edit or proofread or observe what are my problems? I mostly have grammatical problems and vocabulary. Sometimes, I use some words and phrases in the wrong place. 

Well, I'm thinking of writing on a domain I don't even have an idea about. what should I do? Should I start reading about the topic and learn that topic entirely and then start writing on that topic regularly, or I should write something anonymous every day? I actually get stuck at choosing the topic for writing and procrastinate another day. Kindly suggest!"

I think writing is about discovering who you are. Once you find what you love to write about you can do it so much more often and so much better. It will remind you in the times when you don't feel like it that you're meant to write what you love and there is no reason not to do what you love.

I want to become the best writer i can possibly be and enjoy doing it. I don't just want to write sometimes or only when i feel like it. I want to learn to eat breathe and sleep writing. Because that will make it a passion that ill always have, and by putting that much time and love into it I'm sure to get decent. I won't get burnt out writing if every session is geared around why i love writing.

Becoming a great writer is a lot like writing in and of itself. If i start with a character in position A, and then i imagine some insane ending that seems super cool to me, i just need to figure out the most interesting way to get from A to the end. If my goal is to be someone who loves writing and writes 2000+ words nearly every day, then i have to problem solve until i am that person. Or maybe along the way I'll discover a better way.

6262,2020-12-14 07:07:25,kcdg2j,"I‚Äôve been feeling really bad about my own work lately. I write a lot of stories, for years since I was 13, now 20. It feels like My scripts aren‚Äôt interesting and sometimes I believe that my ideas aren‚Äôt good enough. I‚Äôm only starting to learn I have to add in my own flare if I want those ideas to become more than just ideas, and then more than just what‚Äôs been told already. Most of my work is a mixture of what I love or a mixture of shows I‚Äôve seen; I write my own comics and partnered to try to publish for darkhorse next year after 2 years of working on a epically scaled story, it was a idea and it started to really pick up once I started to fall in love with our characters and world, however it still never feels finished like it‚Äôs just getting started or we can do more. 

I‚Äôm currently working on the outline over and over before we send it out in the mail while working on my other passion project stories on the side. I can tell you going to college online has been a nightmare, but it‚Äôs driven me since 2 days ago to really think about what kinda stories I want to tell. I look for every single piece of detail from a characters location, their ecosystem, their clothing, their culture etc. everything that makes the story flourish because of this graphic novel I‚Äôm trying to publish. 

I still have a long way to go, and I don‚Äôt consider myself a writer yet. I honestly didn‚Äôt consider myself a artist for a long time, but sometimes you just gotta appreciate the moment. 

This post was exactly what I was looking for and I feel bad I couldn‚Äôt manage my time enough for so many months to write more and more on what I wanted to do. I bet Pressfield felt the same way and I hope to be able to get my own work published, and have a whole book shelf of graphic novels I can call my accomplishments. 

I consider Graphic Novels just as hard to make as novels if not more in some cases. Love what I do, even if it‚Äôs more of a hobby right now more than anything. Hopefully, it‚Äôll be a great secondary career one day."

I did have this dawning moment in my life one time where I realized that the only thing that separated me from, say, a famous chef, is just what they do.  Like, if I made food that way, that's all there is to it.  I don't have to actually be some different person in order to be able to do it.   I'm not prevented from attaining something because I'm ""just me"".  The only thing standing between me and doing something is doing it.  Maybe it's something I can do, maybe I can't, but people who are achieve amazing things aren't doing it because they're a different class of human being from which I'm excluded.  Finally realizing this as an adult gave me so much more confidence and has made me more relaxed."

Personally, I loved it. It resonated with me and made me want to write. Others hated it, and expressed why. Maybe it's because of their own feelings about writing, or where they are in their journey as a writer.

Here's my solution; You're only a writer when you're writing.

Not when your friends ask. Not when your coworkers ask.

You can tell them that you write, but probably shouldn't present it as a state of being unless it's true.

For instance, you haven't breathed; You're a breather. You constantly are breathing.

Unless you write the same (and some people do), you've written and sometimes/often/seldom write --but you're not a writer.

If you wrote this morning, you were a writer this morning. Feel phenomenal about that.

If you're writing now, you're a writer now (I'm a writer right now).

If you keep saying you'll sit down to write but never do, then you'll be a writer when you sit down to write: Never."

Lawyers, doctors, rocket scientists: none of them share this bizarre obsession with working *every day*. To them, an ordinary work week is plenty to achieve professional success.

Realistically, not taking days off is a recipe for burn out. Not something to strive for.

Writing *consistently* (but with regular days off) is probably important ‚Äî at least it has been for me.

But then again, I know some writers who don‚Äôt write consistently, they‚Äôre much more sporadic. And yet they‚Äôre still writers because they manage to finish works of writing, and that‚Äôs all that matters."

Simple words might excite some people because at that single moment they empathized with the feeling that those simple words meant at the time... for them. But that won‚Äôt last long. There is a reason that Homer‚Äôs Odyssey withstood time and Goethe‚Äôs writing is recognized to this day: they were strict with their structure, they had a purpose, they achieved perfection, their meaning was timeless. I think that is the meaning behind the long post and, for those who care, for those who invest time in becoming better and paying close attention to detail, this long post will mean so much more to them than a short, possibly weak structured post that can be read in seconds and then forgotten while reading the immediately next post. Also, this post is strange for those who have not read similar narration. 

Writing can be a flash of information and an arrow shot straight to the mind. But there is so much more to it; it can be life, it can be expression just for the sake and love of expression itself.

The latter point was so liberating for me because it put the focus on making writing easier and more enjoyable, none of this ""suffering for my art"" bullshit.

6400,2020-12-14 08:23:04,kcdg2j,"It is toxic in that King pretty well says if you aren't writing 2,000 words a day then you aren't a real writer, which if you read my comment would make sense as to why that's toxic. When someone with the platform that King has says something like that in his autobiography on writing, it has an immense negative effect on the writing community. I mean the health of someone's relationship to writing, as Pressfield does as well.

 I'm not saying you won't end up with product if you hammer away 2,000 words every day. But you're going to be on that knife's edge up and down cycle it creates. 

Stephen King became prolific through use of cocaine. He used cocaine to write and write and write, then he has the audacity to tell people they aren't real writers unless they write 2,000 words every day. How did King do it? Cocaine. His advice is actually wreckless, especially for aspiring writers. It's so easy to ease into writing and increase the amount you write at a natural pace without self judgment and that arbitrary obligation to do it every day. That's at the heart of the post and my criticism of King and Pressfield. I'm not saying the boring stuff that has nothing to do with writing advice in King's book on writing is toxic or bad or poorly written or anything. But one of the main pieces of advice he gives in it is toxic. And that really does sort of sour the whole thing. 

But like I said above, I'm not saying that specific techniques that are mentioned are bad, if you find them useful. But show me an aspiring writer who takes to heart the idea that they must write 2,000 words every day or else they're not a real writer, and in a few years it's possible I would then show you a person who has a published book, but not necessarily--but what I would be able to show you is a person who has sacrificed their wellbeing and their relationship to something they could have otherwise been healthy with and loved every step of the way instead of making it an ultimatum. Think about it. It's a bad goal. Aspiring writers haven't even plotted their stories enough to keep a 2,000 word per day pace. So they will fail, or what they will write will veer off into no man's land. Or worse, they will succeed, and every single day they will write, knowing that as soon as they fail there's self abuse waiting for them.

It's the self abuse I'm advocating against. I'm not saying these two mentioned authors directly tell you to beat yourself up (as Pressfield creates a satan figure he calls ""resistance"" to do the beating up for you), but what I am saying is that adopting their goals and mentalities surrounding writing is astronomically more likely to harvest a toxic relationship with writing. Aspiring writers who haven't read those things can consider themselves lucky. 

Also, many aspiring writers don't understand story structure. And most writers end up doing much better after plotting. King discourages plotting. Yep. He does. It really is to the point with him that I wonder if he's intentionally trolling aspiring writers or intentionally trying to divert them. It's hard to tell. But the next time someone becomes successful by using cocaine, and they try to give you advice on how to become successful in that thing, and that advice doesn't include an encouragement to do cocaine, take a step back and question if that advice is very good or if it is very bad. When it comes to Stephen King, I would say it's very bad. 

That said, writers do write. It's an amazing part of the process of creating a story. And if someone wants to be a writer, plotting, outlining, and day dreaming are excellent activities. If you aren't writing, it's much more likely due to some arbitrary expectation you've placed on yourself (from King or Pressfield). If your own story isn't interesting enough to provide natural motivation to put words on the page, it's not because you don't beat yourself up enough (which is essentially what Pressfield is about), it's because you haven't designed a story that pulls you to write it, likely because you've wasted your time not plotting by trying to reach a 2,000 word or some odd daily writing goal. It can be very very good to rest from writing. Pressfield and King come from a different mentality, one that says it makes more sense to feel bad, even when you take one single day off. The thing is, writers benefit from time away from the craft. And they certainly benefit from allowing creativity to flourish for days, weeks, and months without a daily writing goal, or any writing goal for that matter. 

That's why I think that.

Even if King's advice doesn't span many of his pages, the effect of his words on aspiring writers perhaps makes his mentality worse than Pressfield's, as not as many people read Pressfield's the War of Art. But if you ever want a trip down the ""how to create an adversary in your head who constantly tries to trip you up"" rabbit hole, read the War of Art. It'll make you better at beating yourself up than anything else (if you feel drawn to any craft that can remotely be tied to the arts, writing heavily included).

What I will say is that this kind of nose to the grindstone and devil at your heels approach does seem to work for some kinds of goals, like exercise. But as I said above, if a murderer chases you, you will become more fit from the running. You receive the cardiovascular benefit. Doesnt mean you'll enjoy any of it. 

People can beat themselves up to reach goals. It just isn't a good formula for aspiring writers."

Another thing to add onto that is that what I said above doesn't have to have anything to do with feeling like writing. Because I can wake up and not feel like doing shit. I can be tired as hell, maybe I just went through a hard time and am on the verge of depression. I am not trying to erase the pains of life from existence.

but the 2000 word quote specifically in ""On Writing"" is a lot more tame actually:

> I  like  to  get  ten  pages  a  day,  which  amounts  to  2,000 words.  That‚Äôs  180,000  words  over  a  three-month  span,  a goodish length for a book‚Äîsomething in which the reader can get happily lost, if the tale is done well and stays fresh. On some days those ten pages come easily; I‚Äôm up and out and doing errands by eleven-thirty in the morning, perky as a rat in liverwurst. More frequently, as I grow older, I find myself eating lunch at my desk and finishing the day‚Äôs work around  one-thirty  in  the  afternoon.

> If you aren't writing, it's much more likely due to some arbitrary  expectation you've placed on yourself (from King or Pressfield). If your  own story isn't interesting enough to provide natural motivation to put  words on the page

this is just patently false. at least in the generalized form you put forth. this might be your problem, i won't judge. but it's not true for me or for many others. i'm supremely lazy. i need my instant gratification. writing is... not that. my story is great. and i'm having fun telling it. still need the sheer force of will to sit down every day.

so yeah, for me it's a bit like excercise. you do it for the long term benefits. 

> Pressfield and King come from a different mentality, one that says it makes more sense to feel bad 

i can't speak to pressfield but On Writing does simply not put forth this mindset. 

from the ending:

> Writing isn‚Äôt about making money, getting famous, getting dates, getting laid, or making friends. In the end, it‚Äôs about enriching  the  lives  of  those  who  will  read  your  work,  and enriching your own life, as well. It‚Äôs about getting up, getting well, and getting over.

It sounds like you're trying to equate ""having little chance of getting published"" with those who ""can't produce,"" as if 1k or 2k words a day is the only way someone can produce, which is so utterly false.

He uses the word ""suggestion,"" but all the context and belittling he does surrounding the suggestion and the idea that at minimum what you're going to accomplish is to not be a bad writer because being good is likely out of your reach, then it is very clear that his message is ""if you aren't writing a thousand words a day (2k implied, with no days off eventually), then you have no chance of getting published, are doing this thing wrong, and are not a real writer. (If you want more quotes that solidify his message about this I'd be happy to quote his words about to more. It's as if you didn't read the book through the lens of an aspiring writer.

I'm not saying the book doesn't have any good writing advice, but that the toxicity eclipses its effect on aspiring writers. I'm not saying you can't read his autobiography as an interesting look into drug addiction and someone's life. But it creates neurotic writers, if they believe what he says, which aspiring writers can tend to do.

The 2,000 word exact mark is more tame, yes. But when taken in context, the message is, ""start with 1,000 and a day off because you probably can't hack it, but eventually take no days off and write more than 1,000 words a day, as 1,000 is my suggestion for starting point, 2,000 is the real deal."" That's the meaning that comes across in context. And yes, to aspiring writers, his wird count suggestions do sound like must-do advice. He says, ""If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot."" Must. He says must. And then says 1,000 words a day is the starting amount. People who read his book aren't stupid. They get his message. King seems to understand how to use words to convey meaning. The meaning he conveys is exactly: ""If you aren't writing over 1,000 words a day with no days off except maybe holidays, then you are not a real writer.""

Cocaine did not come much later. King used cocaine to write some of his successful books. Had he reached success before then? Yes. Did he use cocaine to do so? No. He used alcohol. He was an alcoholic before he wrote the Shining. That's way back. I'm not concerned about the personal failing part of it. I'm glad he doesn't feel addicted anymore. But he became successful through drug use. Yes, he does say you don't have to use drugs to be successful, but if he became successful via alcohol addiction, maybe some of his other writing advice stems from similar mentalities that come from addiction, which they do. And I'm not saying you can't use that addiction approach to writing. Feel free.

I'll requote this part you think is patently false that I said:  ""If you aren't writing, it's much more likely due to some arbitrary expectation you've placed on yourself (from King or Pressfield). If your own story isn't interesting enough to provide natural motivation to put words on the page""
I stand by this. If your story doesn't motivate you, it's more likely you have arbitrary expectations you've placed on yourself, such as daily writing and word count goals. Are you only trying to refute that with your own anecdote? So you haven't had daily writing goals then? 

No, having a toxic relationship to writing isn't a problem I have anymore. My stories motivate me to write. What I'm saying is that it's amazing. That thing I said above is true for many others. It may not be true for you and for some. But most ""failing"" writers actually do have unattainable writing goals that have diminished their writing progress. I do venture that you at some time had such a goal as well. But hey, maybe not. I'm sorry about the supreme laziness you feel you have. That is a perception about yourself that you interpret more than it is an objective fact about you. Believing that you are lazy can cause you to fulfill that storyline in your mind. It's a perception that you can prove right or just let go of. I'm not saying you have to let it go, but not letting it go doesn't mean that most people who fail at writing didn't have arbitrary goals. Many do. Go ask them. Seriously. You may think my point is patently false, but that's just simply not the case. It can be true for some that the greater their story is the less likely they are to write it, but that's likely from some other reason going on with them. The better your story is, and the fewer arbitrary expectations and self judgment you place on it, the easier it will be to write. Make your story better, and it will write itself, unless you are thoroughly convinced of your laziness.

And I'm sorry if you have any condition that causes the laziness. I'm not trying to be down on things like that, like ADHD or something. I'm just saying if brain chemistry is more average then what I said is totally true for most people. Not all, but most.

Writers can write successful books without forcing themselves to write and beating themselves up when they don't. It's just a fact.

And to be honest your reply sounds like you did not read the book as an aspiring writer, or didn't pick up on the actual context of his advice.

I'm not saying there aren't some good things in his book. He's good at craft. Craft is not all there is to storytelling and novel creation. But it's a part. 

If you're referring to parts of his book that don't have anything to do with writing advice, then yes I'd have to brush up on those to be able to speak about them, but I feel like this is mostly about his advice and the context from which it came, which you seem to have not picked up when reading. I'm not sure why you failed to do so, but if you're going to  claim I don't understand his book, please reread it so you have some semblance of ability to be honest about his advice on writing, as with the amount you seem to be claiming to know the book, your words are now precisely misrepresentative. Please correct your understanding of that book if you're going to support it. It's toxic. But some people like that sort of thing. It's just that most can do better without it.

If you want other quotes from the book I could supply those. There are also good parts of the book I could supply. But the bad ones are there. Actually, come to think of it, I don't recommend rereading it. It really isn't worth it. But you may like Pressfield if you feel writing is something that the devil is trying to stop you from doing. 

And sorry about the blue quote bar if it's here. Didn't figure out how to get rid of it. Also, I wish you and all others luck and success with their writing! You can do it! I haven't found the least toxic way of combating toxic mindsets yet, but maybe one day I'll get closer. Not this day haha. Seriously though, there are healthier ways to approach writing."
6457,2020-12-14 17:21:40,kcdg2j,"Yeah it was a bit unrealistic in addressing the hard side of writing, I agree with that. I honestly don't actually think there is anything wrong with chasing after an unrealistic goal though, as long as I don't give up when I encounter those hard times. If I expect them and still push forward then nothing really can stop me. I think it'd be worth chasing after the flowery side your whole life. The more you can tip the scales of writing to that side of things, the less the burden of the hard times will weigh, the less it will feel like work.

The key seems to be expecting hard times and pushing through anyways I suppose. Anyways, I always love thinking about this stuff :D Thanks for the banter"

This makes it sound like anyone writing every day sound doesn't care about what they're actually writing, but does it to pump out words without care or to compete against other writers.

6477,2020-12-14 16:48:13,kcdg2j,"Brevity is the soul of wit, they say.

To get some things out of the way. I actually do write between 1500 and 2500 words of fiction a day. I take weekends off. I'm fine with my craft and my mindset.

Point is, you are obviously trying to misinterpret whatever you don't agree with as something that's ""toxic"". this is a weird attitude to have. 

there's plenty i disagree with when it comes to stephen king. first of all his novels. i don't particularly like them. but to say he's toxic? that's a little dim.

as someone who actually does this as his job atm, i gotta tell you: if you write less than say 1000 a day the chances of you becoming published, let alone make a living writing, are miniscule to none.

this is simply a fact. can you get lucky? sure. wouldn't bet on it, though.

I'm not condoning it. it's simply the way it is. there are many good writers out there, many of whom are just better at production than you or me. it's a tough, tough marketplace. and aspiring writers need to hear that.

if these are your aspirations, i honestly hope you'll be in the position to see that i'm right, some day. be careful what you wish for, though.

as with any self-employed profession, you gotta put in the time and the effort.

if you just treat it as a hobby and want to tell some good stories, that's fine, too. not saying you can't write good books. maybe you can. maybe you're even gonna get a book deal. but the long-term publishing game is a little more than that.

don't get me wrong. i do care about the art. of course i do. but you gotta be realistic. good art is hard fucking work. *selling* good art even more so.

>But you may like Pressfield if you feel writing is something that the devil is trying to stop you from doing.

Strawman argument. Not what I said.

> Writers can write successful books without forcing themselves to write  and beating themselves up when they don't. It's just a fact. 

sure, they can write books without forcing themselves to write. successful ones? no. there's deadlines, contracts and your agent and editor basically sit on your lap. there's gonna be days you just hate sitting on your computer, but still gotta.

it's not about beating yourself up about not writing. it's simply about developing a decent work ethic. and that's not toxic. that's just reality. you won't make it in this game if you're not able to treat it as a job.

a great and terrifying and ridiculous and fulfilling job.

6491,2020-12-14 18:23:02,kcdg2j,"Yeah I feel like you're not grasping the difference between interpretive frame and writing goals that people place for themselves that are not good to have when starting out writing. I too have written at that word count you've described. It's not bad to write at that word count. And if you become successful, you will likely enjoy writing around that or above. That is entirely different from the message King gives in his book on writing. I'm not trying to misinterpret whatever I don't agree with as toxic. I'm specifically saying to tell an aspiring writer the things that King does in the context he does so has the effect of saying you need to write a thousand words a day and can have a day off for now, but not for long. It sounds like you think I'm saying that successful authors don't get up to that kind of word count product. That's not what I'm saying. They do. It's toxic for writers who are starting out. Not the device to write, the frame surrounding it.

Brevity may be the soul of wit, some say, but thoroughness is the soul of lucidity, and we are talking about things in a lucid way, not trying to be witty, unless that's something I've missed that you've been trying to do.

If you wrote 500 words every other day your chance of being published versus writing 1000 words every day does not go from minuscule (to none) to having a chance. You have a chance of being published if you write 500 words every other day. Please don't make up something otherwise. And yes, once a writer is published they may increase their writing. But again, I think you've missed the point about aspiring.

I'm glad you write a bunch, and hope you're successful, and hope you're not neurotic about it or beat yourself constantly for it. It just isn't true to tell people to try to do a thousand words a day with one day off a week and that is the way you know if you're doing it right. Many aspiring writers who read King's book on writing come away with that exact goal and that exact message and that exact misinformation. It just isn't true. 

Yes, you put time and effort into it. It's as if you don't think that I think time and effort are necessary. You're completely missing the point. Making good art is definitely work, a lot of work. What I'm saying is that the Pressfield's and the King's of the world are giving a bad frame around writing for aspiring writers. ""Write"" is great advice. The way King says it with the context in which he says it has toxic effect for many people. Aspiring writers could use some more plotting, which King tells them not to do. Add it together and the effect is neurotic writers. Pressfield is even worse. If you read that you would likely better understand what I'm trying to say.

This is not a strawman argument:
""But you may like Pressfield if you feel writing is something that the devil is trying to stop you from doing.""
It's conditional. If you feel writing is something that the devil is trying to stop you from doing, you may like Pressfield. 1. It cannot be a strawman because I'm not saying it is you. I'm saying if it is you, if you fit the description, then you may like Pressfield. If you don't fit the description, the statement doesn't apply to you. 2. It is actually a true statement. If you believe the devil is trying to stop you from writing, that's what the War of Art is about. Seriously. So it's true you may like it if that's the way you view the world. 3. The word ""may"" is much too unspecific for logic to say the statement is wrong, as it is true that you may, whether you fit the description or not, but the statement is tied to the description. I'm fine if it turns out you're wanting to condescend, but if that's what you're doing, please at least have a basic understanding of the fallacies you decide to mention, as you clearly do not. I feel bad that this sounds mean, but I love the truth too much to pass it up. Maybe you understand other fallacies. But you don't understand the strawman fallacy (according to your use of the term).

If you have deadlines and contacts and agents, you are already a successful author. I'm not talking about already successful authors. A successful author would probably not be as negatively impacted by King's book on writing. I'm talking about aspiring writers who don't have deadlines and contracts and agents. But even then, it's not necessary to force yourself to do it. ""Force"" is an interpretation and a frame, not a reality. You can set aside time to write. That's not force. Admittedly, many people may not be able to reach deadlines without forcing themselves. This is what I'm talking about. King's book contributes to their perception of forcing themselves. Locking yourself in your room. Etc. 

You can develop a good work ethic without beating yourself up. I think that's something we can agree on. Some people are able to take a writing goal of 1,000 words every day with one day off a week (and later no days off a week while writing 2,000 words a day) and not be toxic with it. I'm not saying that isn't possible. But when advice like that is taken by writers who are starting out and just developing their approach and relationship to writing, and if they have added that with the frame and context King gave them, for most it's a recipe for disaster. 

If you've seen the movie Whiplash, writing is not like how drumming is in whiplash. Writing isn't about sacrificing everything to become good. It's not about sweating and bleeding. It's about creating a great story, an enjoyable story. That involves periods of day dreaming. Especially for aspiring writers who don't have deadlines. And I think plotting the novel is key to this, as it's astronomically harder to get ""writer's block"" when you have an understanding of what's coming. I'm not saying do nothing and a book will appear. I'm saying the order of operations King gives harms aspiring writers. That's why I call it toxic. I'm not a fanatic about ""toxic"" things. But this one happens to fit the description. 

I'm glad to hear about your writing successes. And I bet you could write a better book about writing than Stephen King did."

Again, I literally just said I'm annoyed by that advice and your immediate response was to give it.

>And you seem like in general you need to calm down and take a look at yourself if you‚Äôre seeing personal attacks in such innocuous things

It's hard not to feel attacked by someone who is obviously trolling me.

>you can demand complete strangers only tell you what you want to hear.

I didn't demand a damn thing from you. You chose to reply to me. You chose to say something to me that I explicitly stated annoys me. Don't be an asshole and expect people to treat you nicely for it."

The Moor Mother & bill woods album is what I'm most excited to hear but it's not on streaming. [the LP looks sick tho](https://backwoodzstudioz.com/product/moor-mother-billy-woods-brass-vinyl/)

if you like Detroit stuff, check out the Cash Kidd tape, also the RMC Mike tape.

If you like art rap stuff like OME and R.A.P. Ferreira, check out Mike Ladd's album, that dude is a legend to those guys.

Vory co-wrote ""Mob Ties"" by Drake so check that out if u want

that Young Scooter album is stacked. That dude was killin it in the early 10s with his trap tapes.

Fana Hues makes cool R&B

Heem is in Benny's Black Soprano Family group.

that Pressa EP looks stacked

ive only listened to the cudi album and my opinion about it now is very unpopular but might become more acceptable to express in ~3 weeks. here's some fun credits stuff:

1. FINNEAS, billie eilish's brother who she works with on all her stuff, co-produced Beautiful Trip and Sept. 16
2. Kevin Parker of Tame Impala co-produced Dive

Price of tea I love, but it can really put me to sleep at times. Manger has probably the highest highs, but also I think 2 songs I really don't care for, and RBB has one song I don't live on it.

I personally felt like real bad man complimented boldy perfectly in the fairly low key but very interesting production along with Boldys fairly low key but very interesting delivery and content.

I still have to say though, my least favorite release from him I still love. The only reason I can rank them fairly easily is because I listen to all of them all the way through so often, there's not a single bad choice here."

It took around 10-12 years to form and complete the instrumentals and the overall structure of the album, there is an incredible story that details the making of it on the bandcamp page for the album.

It is also a fucking amazing album and you should definitely give it a listen, it‚Äôs a lot more jazzy and experimental than Price of Tea in China but it is such a crazy listen and has some really fantastic songs on it, especially Detroit River Rock and Mommy Dearest (A Eulogy)."

6604,2020-12-10 22:57:51,kaoj0b,"Totally on board with the Jets getting Arthur Smith as HC. Fine with the FA signings because it is only money and they have a ton of cap space.

Overall a great job, though."
6605,2020-12-10 23:08:42,kaoj0b,"First, tremendous amount of work you've done and kudos on that. 

As a bears fan, this will never happen. We cannot afford Wentz's contract for one. And we won't be taking another of phillies ex qbs."
6606,2020-12-10 22:25:16,kaoj0b,"First off, holy shit is this a ton of work. Props to you, this is incredible.

But I don‚Äôt see the Browns spending $12M on a corner on the wrong side of 30, one year after he looked completely washed. X has earned another deal with his play this year, but I would much rather just take Campbell or Stokes (or even move up for Horn or Wade) in the first than gamble that Rhodes can keep it up at 31 years old

The other FA pick ups are home runs though"
6607,2020-12-10 22:47:53,kaoj0b,"A couple things I'm not sure I understand the rationale on for the Colts:

* We trade for Darnold, but re-sign Rivers, and it really doesn't make sense to do both. Rivers isn't signing anywhere to be a backup, and the only reason for us to trade for Darnold is if we think he can be the franchise QB. Since Darnold only has one year left on his rookie contract, if we trade for him he needs to be the starter so we can find out if he's the guy or not.
* You have Shaun Wade falling to the Colts because he can't play on the outside in college, but we have no need for a slot corner. Kenny Moore is one of the best nickels in the league, so our need at corner is on the outside. By your own description, Wade doesn't fill that role."
6608,2020-12-10 22:48:03,kaoj0b,"Great job overall! Really appreciate the amount of work you put in to this. I like your overall plan and think it is realistic for the most part, I don't think Denver lets Simmons walk away though. He is by far our best and most consistent player over these last two years and has been playing on an All-Pro level for two seasons as well."
6609,2020-12-11 02:12:05,kaoj0b,"I'm always glad to see this much effort, but what did the Cowboys do to you to deserve Dom Capers?"
6610,2020-12-10 23:21:18,kaoj0b,"LAC:

Assuming Tom Telesco remains GM, there is essentially a 0% chance that he hires Bieniemy. The main reason being that TT prioritizes high character guys on the roster, you won‚Äôt find anyone with a criminal history at all. He cuts any player that has anything like a domestic violence charge. There is no way he goes  against that philosophy when it comes to picking a head coach. 

Then, I just don‚Äôt see how Gus Bradley survives into the next coaching staff. He‚Äôs had a fucking terrible year. We are routinely obliterated in the second half of games. 

Mike Williams is on the chopping block to get cut as we would save $15 million. Hayward has taken a step back and there are talks of cutting him as well, but I think we keep him another year. Either way, it is unlikely he gets an extension. Melvin Ingram took a HUGE step back this year and finished the season on IR with no sacks. 

Signing Corey Linsley makes a lot of sense. Winston and Fournette, not so much. 

And lastly, I‚Äôm hoping we fire Telesco anyway. It‚Äôs time for him to go."
6611,2020-12-10 23:49:48,kaoj0b,"I don't think Incognito will be cut. Yes he did have a season ending injury very early on and is old, but he really made the left side shine when he was out there, and seems to be a well liked guy here.

No chance in hell we draft a QB in round 2. I'm not Carr's number 1 fan, but there are much more pressing needs there. Can't reset the QB room already. This really isn't as much of a sunken cost fallacy as it is Carr doing fine enough in the system. Another solid receiver, and some depth at OL and we're set on offense."
6612,2020-12-11 04:34:30,kaoj0b,"Great job on the Ravens. You know this team better than 90% of our fans. Signing Robinson and Ngakoue and then drafting Wyatt Davis is a dream scenario. Writing is on the wall for Ingram. I don't think RG3 will be back though. He's too injury prone and it's time for McSorely to step up. That $2.5M would probably go to resigning RFA Gus Edwards. I really wish we could keep Bowser around but that's probably asking too much. 

In the draft I really like what you did. No complaints at all."
6613,2020-12-10 23:18:54,kaoj0b,"Great job! I just have a question: what do you think about Joe Douglas of the NYJ signing one of the elite WRs going into free agency this year? Golladay, ARob, etc?"
6614,2020-12-11 01:51:47,kaoj0b,"I‚Äôm not sure Ron Rivera would trade up for a QB this year. Even though Montez Sweat has been great, he wasn‚Äôt shy about saying he was not happy about not having a 2nd rounder last year, and I think he knows we‚Äôre still in need of quality players and depth at a handful of positions before we can compete for a title."
6615,2020-12-11 07:00:23,kaoj0b,"Dig the general idea of the moves you made for the Pats, minus re-signing Cam. My theory is that we bring Jacoby Brissett back on a two-year deal and let Newton go (To be the backup in Washington? Just spitballing.). Not sure Bill would shell out that kind of money for Shaq Barrett, but I'm not opposed. Signing Juju is a fun idea, as is drafting Bateman and Ross. Bateman kind of gives me N'Keal Harry vibes which is scary, but one of these days we have to hit on a receiver pick, right?"
6616,2020-12-10 23:20:04,kaoj0b,"Great effort

This would be a very disappointing FA period for LAC. Love getting linsley, but extending Mike Williams seems incredibly unlikely and ill conceived. We‚Äôre already paying huge money to Keenan Allen, and Mike is probably going to want to get WR1 money somewhere and he is not worth that. 

Casey could get an extension but it would have to be small. Age is catching up with him. Personally I think he should transition to the slot soon

Ingram is old and the production and effort are not there this year. I‚Äôd be really surprised if we bring him back

The draft is solid, could use an early IOL but still solid. Love getting Duffy"

6621,2020-12-11 14:02:42,kaoj0b,"This is a hell of an effort, and I appreciate the work you put into it.  I have a couple of comments though, this wouldn't be Reddit if I didn't.  
  
Joe Brady has exactly three years of NFL experience with only one as an OC and he's running the 21st ranked offense despite having some pretty good weapons.  I just don't see him leapfrogging the competition and landing a head coaching gig this offseason.  If he did, it would be based on one record breaking year as an offensive assistant on a college football team that was loaded with talent.  Not sure an NFL GM is going to subscribe to that.  
  
We will probably move on from Kawaan Short this year.  He has been hurt for two years running and has an absurd cap figure.  Paradis is also at risk.  If we dump those two contracts, we will need a starting Center but we will also have a lot of cap space.  Some of that will probably be used to retain Curtis Samuel."
6622,2020-12-11 17:34:48,kaoj0b,"Love the effort, this is awesome.  
  
For NE, I think you've largely done a good job of making realistic moves.  
- I love Juju for fit and at that price  
- I think it's realistic for Cam to return on a cheap-ish deal in that range (I expect he tests FA, doesn't get anything appealing then comes back) and I know the team loves him  
- I don't see us spending up on Shaq Barrett. I'd actually like it at that cost but with the draft capital recently invested in the edges and our overall tendencies, I see more specialized edge help at a lower cost  
- I like Bateman, but I can't say I'm fully sold on him as a mid-1st round player and wouldn't want to just take him at 16 because Smith went immediately before it. I like the idea of investing in receiving talent but, particularly with the Juju signing in this mock, Pitts might be the better target there   
- Shelvin is a great fit, the kind of guy BB is always looking for and fills a need  
- I like Moore a lot as a prospect. I don't foresee further day 2 investment in LBs after last season, with Bentley rounding into form as a full time ILB, with the finding of useful support in Terez Hall and with Kyle Dugger's role as a run wrecking box safety. I might be wrong, Belichick loves his LBs, I just don't know that it's high priority entering this coming draft. If Hightower retires then this opinion flips, but if that's the line, maybe it's more likely than I think right now...   
- I don't know too much about each individual over the rest of the draft but I think you've got the right idea in terms of depth roles that need to be filled  
  
All that said, and this is a somewhat general observation more than a you-specific observation, I'm very hung up on Zach Wilson falling to 12 and us not trading up to get him. I don't follow the draft cycle year-round but it seems like every year I come back around toward the end of the season and the mock community has had a strong contingent of people projecting the Pats to take a marginal QB talent at the end of the first round. This is the first year where A) the Pats have a relatively high pick, B) the Pats have a need at QB and C) there are multiple QBs with that high 1st round pedigree. It finally makes sense for the team to make a move for a QB and the mock community in general seems to be shying away from it. With your full-offseason mock here I can understand the angle of rolling with Cam and bolstering everything around him, but as a fan I'd embrace a move up for a rookie 1st round QB even if we keep Cam. If not a trade up for a falling Wilson or Lance, Trask right there in the 2nd becomes incredibly hard to overlook. I can't imagine Cam gets re-signed in that cheap range without the deal being easy to move on from. Cam just isn't a long-term answer. Even though I could see the team competing with an improved offensive supporting cast and another year of investment, we can't lean so heavily into this QB power offense and hoping to hide an average passer with elite weapons (and that's to say nothing of how hard we've struggled to develop weapons). We need to have something in the works at least in the event of Cam getting hurt, but also in pursuit of a consistently above average passer, and we haven't been better positioned to do that in a really long time."

6630,2020-12-16 20:30:06,kaoj0b,"Hey, I know I'm real late to the party but I didn't see any comments on SF so I figured I would add to that. First off, fantastic job with this work, it looks amazing. 

* I'm coming in with the context that I think that the team needs goes as follows: CB, EDGE, QB, WR, IOL. I don't think Shannahan prioritizes IOL but it all depends on the outlook of Weston Richburg. If he's not going to be healthy again then we need C before QB and WR. 
* I would guess that we don't re-sign Sherman. He looks like he might have lost a step as a corner and he's been aligning in really weird spots on our defense the past couple of weeks. It feels like we're trying to hide him and not put him on the outside. Plus we have to give Fred Warner a new deal and it's gonna be pricy. If we can hit the CB position in the draft like this then I could die happy because that's just what this team needs. 
* Jenkens is probably out of our price range. We're gonna be tight against the cap until it starts rising again and spending money on a safety is probably a luxury we can't afford
*  We probably also won't make any FA moves for a RB. We have 3 backs the team likes in Mostert, Hasty, and Wilson.

6636,2020-12-11 01:46:42,kaoj0b,"First of all, what an incredible amount of work to put into this, major props.

That being said, if this was the Broncos offseason, I'd be pretty frustrated. Letting both Simmons and Shelby Harris walk is a huge mistake, I don't see us retaining at least one if not both. Cutting Bouye and Casey would free a ton of cap. While Blythe is good, Cushenberry is a rookie with no offseason and is only getting started with NFL-level conditioning. I expect a ton of growth by next year, and if not, I believe they'll bring in competition after that. And Trubisky will benefit no one, but especially the Broncos. They've already got Driskel, Rypien, and Bortles, I can't imagine they want Trubisky over them. 

The draft is pretty good. I could see RT, CB, or QB being the first pick depending on how the staff views Lock and how FA goes. Personally I'd love a shiny new QB if we're already in the top 10, especially if Zach Wilson is sitting there when we pick.

I LOVED the first 3 rounds for the chargers, but I thought the off season signings were pretty terrible. Resigning Hunter Henry and is a must and getting Linsley is cool but I think we should let Ingram go and give Nwosu the go ahead at edge, signing Jameis is bad I think the FO has faith in Easton Stick as a backup. Re-signing Michael Davis and Rayshawn Jenkins are going to be priorites. While they arent high level players Davis still has alot of potential and Jenkins is much needed for depth."

6644,2020-12-11 14:14:20,kaoj0b,"This is incredibly impressive by the way. Really appreciate the effort.

As a Bengals fan here's my notes on them. 

As much as I want Taylor gone you're probably right that he'll be back considering Mike Brown's history. But at least you got Anarumo gone, which has to happen. 

Kind of light on the transactions but at least we pick up and Edge player and get rid of Bobby Hart. Unfortunately I could see this happening too. I could absolutely see Mike Brown deciding last year's spending was enough even though if we want to compete we need to capitalize on Burrow being cheap and spend around him.

The draft is only ok for us though. Sewell is obvious and must get, but I don't really like taking an LB in second. I'd much rather focus on our bigger needs there, being IOL, EDGE, and WR.

My biggest issue is the lack of action happening on the O line for us. You have us trading out Hart for Sewell (a major upgrade for sure) but the only other change is a 4th round center. That absolutely cannot be all we do with the line. As bad as Bobby Hart is our biggest weakness on the line has been our guards. If we don't spend money on a free agent guard then we have to take one or two in the draft. Preferably as early as the second round. Hell if Wyatt Davis falls to 17 like you predicted I'd see if could trade 35 and another future 2nd for him."
6645,2020-12-11 16:52:47,kaoj0b,"Holy shit, this is impressive! Love most of what you did for Baltimore, Mike McDaniel is one of my top candidates if Roman gets fired and you hit all the right positions in the draft. My one nitpick is that while Hutchinson is really good I don't think he's a very good fit for a 3-4 team unless he bulks up some more to play on the DL. Ojulari or Phillips would probably be a better choice for OLB/EDGE there."
6646,2020-12-11 18:57:19,kaoj0b,">The Rams are in a bit of a tight spot cap wise. With so much money tied into just a handful of players, Les Snead is forced to let a lot of key contributors go. Whitworth retires, and A'Shawn Robinson is cut. Higbee, Woods, and Kupp are asked to restructure their deals. Darious Williams gets an RFA tender to stay with the team, and Riley Reiff is brought in to replace Whitworth at LT.

A'Shawn won't be cut that doesn't help the cap at all with a $4.5 million cap hit cutting him would put $6.5 million in dead money on the books so that's a terrible idea. 

Whitworth very well could retire and that would save us about $5 million but create a hole, depending on how Boom plays the rest of the way but he's a free agent after 2021. 

Kupp and Woods both signed short term extensions but Kupp has a $2.5 million roster bonus that can be converted to signing bonus freeing up a little bit but I doubt that happens. 

Also it's very early to worry about teams and their cap for 2021 since we don't know what it will be the $175 million simply won't happen a more realistic expectation is for the cap to remain at $198 for a few years but even with that we're tight without moves. 

The only way I'm ok with signing Reiff is to a vet minimum to be depth behind Boom. Guy can't stay on the field we don't need to pay him. I'd rather draft a guy this year to battle Boom or sit a year at Guard then slide out next year if we don't retain Boom. 

An upgrade at C, ILB and a speed WR who can return are priorities. We'll likely draft a Safety and a CB as well for depth with Johnson and Hill likely leaving in free agency. 

Brown is a nice pick though and would love him at Guard but that leaves center as a vacancy so another pick there would be needed unless a cheap vet is brought in. As much as I would like an upgrade to Blythe taking the Guard would hurt the chance of that with limited picks, before comp picks and trades which Snead does a lot of during the draft. 

I may disagree with some of your options for the Rams but this is an impressive amount of work and props for doing this all!"

Patrick is playing well as you‚Äôve pointed out, and Juedy flashes a lot as well. We‚Äôve seen Fant show a ton, Lindsay and Gordon are solid, and the line is solid except RT, but we‚Äôre stuck with Juwaan James on a huge contract there next year anyway. He opted out this year which mean he didn‚Äôt accrue a year on his contract.

Basically Elway‚Äôs drafted one 1st round QB and that was way up at 26. I don‚Äôt think anyone would blame him for trying to shoot his shot at a top 10 type QB since his late 1st/2nd round mentality hasn‚Äôt exactly faired well. 

I also can‚Äôt see us drafting a center. It‚Äôs been rocky sure, but Cush is a rookie and he hasn‚Äôt been awful. We just spent a 3rd on him last year. Safety may need replacing, but with Bolles signed long term it‚Äôs hard to see us not at least tagging Simmons again. The guys all all pro talent.

If I‚Äôm being honest I‚Äôd be pretty upset with this draft. If have to at least look at moving on from Lock, and we need CB help because Bouye is suspended and expensive, and Callahan has serious injury problems."

Pettine especially has no ties to MLF and I'm betting MLF will push Gute hard to let him bring his own guy for DC. One other more minor note, but Allen Lazard is an ERFA and can be tendered for just $600k if I remember the figure correctly.

As a final comment purely from my own opinion, I'd almost guarantee that we'd be willing to pay Jamaal Williams more than $3.75 million to retain him. With his solid running, receiving, and blocking skills he is more than capable to be a solid if not remarkable lead back for us in a RBBC."

6674,2020-12-12 10:11:29,kaoj0b,"I‚Äôd like to say that this was an extraordinary thing to read. The amount of work and time out into this has to be insane, and you deserve major props. Some things I definitely disagree with though. No way the Bears take Wentz as a backup. He‚Äôs way too expensive and honestly probably not worth it. Wentz can be paid to mentor Hurts in Philly. Also no way the Pats are giving Cam an extension. Cam has played terribly this year, and I just can‚Äôt see Belicheck willingly giving Cam an extension. Cam will probably go somewhere, I‚Äôm just not sure where though. I kinda doubt Brees is gonna retire this year. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, he should but it‚Äôs not likely. Even if he does, Shaun Payton is dying to prove all the naysayers wrong about Taysom. Taysom is the heir apparent to Brees. I don‚Äôt think Jerry Jones wants to shell out for Dak. Dak might be headed to Boston or possibly Denver. I don‚Äôt see him staying in Dallas. Since Deshaun Watson wants Will Fuller to stay in Houston, it‚Äôd be hard to see Houston not giving Fuller an extension. I‚Äôm not sure what Chicago is going to do. I don‚Äôt think Trubisky is the problem in Chicago, and letting him walk could be a huge mistake. Even if the Bears do let him go, I think he‚Äôll sit for a bit but eventually take snaps somewhere. Pittsburgh or maybe he can go learn from Brady in Florida. I doubt Juju is going to Boston. Yes we need help at wide receiver but I think Schuster likes Pittsburgh quite a bit. Darnold should go to a team with an older QB. Indy, Pittsburgh, Tampa, Minnesota. Some people think Darnold is headed to Boston but Bill hates the Jets so I doubt it a lot. This is really well put together, and overall you did a great job, but there‚Äôs just some bad takes in here."

6676,2020-12-13 02:23:41,kaoj0b,"Nice job. Re:Hawks

>The Seahawks are in a bit of a surprising spot as one of the only powerhouse teams with a plethora of cap space. That cap space allows them to retain several key free agents, including the Griffin brothers, Geno Smith, Ethan Pocic, and Chris Carson. They also have the space to extend Lockett and Jamal Adams on front loaded deals. Unfortunately, the Seahawks only have four picks in this draft. They need to make the most out of those picks, adding a pass rusher, a depth CB, an OL, and a potential WR3.

I would disagree with one thing here. This FO hasn't paid a back other than Marshawn Lynch and Carson has an injury history stretching back to high school. He'll have had two season ending injuries in the past 3 years and missed significant time in the other season. 

He's awesome at turning nothing into something and has developed significantly as a pass catcher but I can't imagine Carroll invests 7M into a guy that is made of glass, especially when PC wants explosive plays out of his backs and Carson is too slow to deliver them

You need the obligatory Seattle trade down too. Schneider will be wheeling and dealing like never before with only 4 picks. He'll turn that into 7 lower picks for sure."

I'd love to have both Williams and Sherman signed team-friendly deals, but they will probably have better offers. I'd also hope we re-sign Hyder Jr. CB and S are key needs, but we should take a look at C, LB depth, and shopping picks for players who can help us win now."

I see yannick getting a 2nd-year franchise tag. Since he took a paycut to leave the jags, the 2nd-year franchise tag for him is between 18-19 mil, pretty much the price of a 1st year tag. Judon most likely walks, and yannick stays. 

Since we suck so bad at drafting WRs, here‚Äôs hoping to us getting Allen Robinson, Corey Davis or Kenny Golladay. We need that true #1. Move Hollywood into the slot.

6683,2021-01-08 05:09:58,kaoj0b,"I think NE is going to swing bigger at QB. Belichic knows Cam will be serviceable, but he's not their future franchise QB. And there might be a potential franchise QB in this draft for them.

Several people seem to think NE will get a QB at 15. Some say Justin Fields and some say ZACH¬†WILSON, BYU. That of course assumes no one moves up to get a QB. I don't give a shit about the Patriots, but I would like to see Fields go to a good spot and I think NE could be it. Give Belichic a few years with a starting QB on a rookie contract, and they might have the chance to rebuild. Along with the players that opted out because of the Coronavirus returning and the Pat's might be back.

Let's face it, Fields to the Jets will suck for him. Maybe the Jets like Wilson more than Justin. From what I have seen, Wilson is pretty damn good. Strong arm, can extend plays and is always poised. Or maybe the Jets stay pat (no pun intended). I think Sam Darnold is going to be a very good QB in the League. If the Jets and Adam Gase haven't knocked the football out that dude. But I don't think anyone can say Fields or Wilson will definitely be better than Darnold."

Then shoring up the depth with some great scheme fits in Bateman and Shelvin and making some decent late and mid round picks in Patterson. Only minor complaints are, Smith going 1 pick before us to a division rival, out of our control but still stings a lot and Moore doesn't fit our scheme, and with only keeping 1 of our 3 best IDL only adding one more leaves us pretty thin.  

PS Wise is an IDL for us currently as we run a 3-4 and he can't play OLB."

Not trying to be a homer but he is going to fetch a mid-second to late first pick.  I believe he is still the youngest starting qb in the league and a lot of teams will be bidding for him.

I 100% agree with what you're saying about Rhodes, he'll get a new deal but if it is from us, it's gonna be cheap and I don't think: 

1. He's gonna sign a cheap deal after what he's shown this year unless it's with Miami.

And this isn't one of those ""we're just adding a good guy to the QB room"" and then Mariota gets benched for Tannehill kind of scenarios. Rivers is firmly the starter. The idea here is for Reich to see what he has in Darnold in camp/preseason. If the Colts are out of it by December, maybe Darnold gets a couple starts. If not, I don't think it's too harmful a deal. The Saints gave a similar package for Bridgewater. The Phins gave more than that for Rosen and he only lasted a year.
2. Thanks for the insight. I assumed CB in general was a need. I haven't watched Colts games too closely so I assumed Moore played more of a safety role. Maybe Horn or Stokes is a better pick."

Again, I don't condone or endorse the behavior, but if there hasn't been any reoccurences of this kind of behavior after 27 years I think he'd at least be afforded an interview to judge where his character stands today."

In a deep WR class with 4-6 1st round prospects and with as many early picks as you have, I'd rather take my shot on a rookie and spend money fortifying the defense and the OL. This WR class is supposed to be just as good as last year's, and we've seen what kind of impact those guys have had already.

Just my 2 cents though. There are certainly other ways to build teams and my way is far from the only correct method."
6706,2020-12-11 05:35:20,kaoj0b,Agreed. Also don't see WFT drafting another one year starter at QB after Haskins' struggles to adapt to the NFL. Rivera has alluded to this throughout the season. I see them drafting a QB with multiple years of starter experience.

I'd agree on KK Short; he's played what, four games in the last two seasons?  No way we keep him with that cap.  Paradis is more questionable; I'd like to replace him, but getting a new Center may be tricky this off-season.  Burris has been pretty solid when he's been playing for us; I don't think cutting him would be a good idea unless we *really* need the cap.  

I'm not sold on re-signing Okung (and I don't believe he's worth more than Moton, RT vs. LT value or not).  He's just going to give us the OLine equivalent of KK.  

We also badly need to take a CB before round 5.  I don't know much about Dazz Newsome , but I'd much rather try to pick up another corner there."
6712,2020-12-13 14:16:30,kaoj0b,"That's my thoughts on Joe Brady as well. I think he's going to have to produce a top offense for a couple of years before he gets the nod at HC.

Belichick was willing to spend (at the time) top dollar for Stephon Gilmore. But he wasn't willing to pay the market rate for, say, Chandler Jones. My guess is that it could happen, but it won't happen if it's $15M a year.

6722,2020-12-12 15:06:05,kaoj0b,"Thanks for the feedback! Here are my rebuttals

> No way the Bears take Wentz as a backup. He‚Äôs way too expensive and honestly probably not worth it. Wentz can be paid to mentor Hurts in Philly

This is definitely the most outlandish thing I have in this mock. But I think that if Philly is going to start Hurts long term (big if), they will want to offload Wentz's contract. Sure he can be a mentor, but you don't pay $30M+ for a backup QB. If he does to CHI (again big if), he would be the starter over Foles. They would build a defense/run first team and let Wentz manage the game. 

 > no way the Pats are giving Cam an extension. Cam has played terribly this year, and I just can‚Äôt see Belicheck willingly giving Cam an extension.

Cam hasn't been great, but a $15M deal for 1-3 years isn't a backbreaker. The Pats have plenty of cap space and that would make Cam the 22nd highest paid QB, which is very reasonable. I agree that he hasn't been great, but there are so many problems with that offense. No matter who they bring in to QB, they're going to struggle with no one to throw to. I think it's likely that Bill spends this year rejuvenating the talent at the skill positions before targeting a QB. 

 > I kinda doubt Brees is gonna retire this year. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, he should but it‚Äôs not likely. Even if he does, Shaun Payton is dying to prove all the naysayers wrong about Taysom. Taysom is the heir apparent to Brees

I agree with you here, but I had Brees retiring to simplify things. Saints are in cap hell and his retirement saves them a lot of money. Plus he's coming off a very painful rib injury. 

 > I don‚Äôt think Jerry Jones wants to shell out for Dak. Dak might be headed to Boston or possibly Denver. I don‚Äôt see him staying in Dallas.

I disagree with this. Jerry has seen what his team is without Dak. They're horseshit. He's also got a history of treating his homegrown players well. Look at Sean Lee, Romo, Jaylon Smith, Witten. I think he pays Dak.

 > Since Deshaun Watson wants Will Fuller to stay in Houston, it‚Äôd be hard to see Houston not giving Fuller an extension.

Watson may want to keep Fuller, but Houston has no cap space to work with and it makes all the sense in the world for Fuller to chase money after the only healthy season of his career. I don't see how (logistically) Houston retains him.

 > I‚Äôm not sure what Chicago is going to do. I don‚Äôt think Trubisky is the problem in Chicago, and letting him walk could be a huge mistake. Even if the Bears do let him go, I think he‚Äôll sit for a bit but eventually take snaps somewhere.

Honestly this is the first time I've heard somebody defend Trubisky in the last 2 years. I honestly think there are 40+ other QBs I'd rather have starting over him. He may not be the problem but he sure as fuck ain't the solution.

 > I think Schuster likes Pittsburgh quite a bit

While I'm sure JuJu has plenty of friends in Pittsburgh, the Steelers have no cap space to sign him. The successes of Claypool and Diontae make him expendable, and they have much more important needs to address (Dupree, Villanueva are up this year, Minkah, Watt the year after). JuJu is one of the top 5 WRs in the market this year and it makes sense for him to follow the money."
6723,2020-12-11 06:09:07,kaoj0b,"The only problems I had with this mock for us were:
He also had us losing Nick Caserio but he signed a multi-year contract situation this March. 
Also, why would we pick Rashod Bateman when:
1. Jaylen Waddle is on the board
2. We signed JuJu in the offseason

I know we need receiver help, but I can‚Äôt imagine BB paying JuJu then drafting another WR in the first. Plus, it would suck to pass up Waddle.

Worst of all, I can‚Äôt see us signing Newton to a 15 MILLION dollar contract extension."

6730,2020-12-11 16:41:15,kaoj0b,"I'll say that I could be wrong about Darnold's trade value, but I don't think I am. I mentioned elsewhere in this thread that the Saints gave a similar package for Teddy Bridgewater. The Dolphins gave a 2nd for a 22 year old Rosen who was widely touted as a top 3 QB prospect in that class. I'm a Darnold fan too. He was my top QB in that class and in their rookie seasons I firmly believed that he would have the best career of the class. 

But I don't see a team giving up a 1st when they could just as easily get one of the top 4-6 QBs, all of whom are younger than Darnold (only Trask and Mac are older than 21) and come from winning organizations/cultures, in this class on a longer deal (5 years vs 1 year) for cheaper that doesn't have to unlearn all the atrocious Gase-isms that have been ingrained into his mechanics and into his mind."

6733,2020-12-11 05:04:59,kaoj0b,"With how many times he's been injured,  the Colts would be stupid to avoid drafting a WR because they want to be sure there's still plenty of touches for Parris Campbell. He's spent his first two seasons proving he's incapable of staying healthy in the NFL, they absolutely can't count on him being a major contributor going forward."
6734,2020-12-11 10:54:39,kaoj0b,"Yeah this is a retarded scenario for Indianapolis. We already have an injury-prone WR, and no need to let Rhodes go if we are just going to sign an alternative veteran CB, and also literally zero reason to let Hilton go to free agency either. I think Darnold is a shit-tier QB I wouldn't be mad at acquiring him but not to give up a 3rd round pick to get him"
6735,2020-12-11 07:45:15,kaoj0b,"AGREED.

We'll fucking cut someone if Simmons walks."
6736,2020-12-11 17:10:09,kaoj0b,"I think another year of Lock is believable, but what I think is funny in this analysis is giving Lock another year while replacing Lloyd Cushenberry.

I wonder if the team will have the guts to spend a 1st on a tackle with Juwaun James still on the books for such a big amount next year. I'm not comfortable just hoping he stays healthy and leaving the RT depth as shitty as it currently is, but that's a lot of money invested in tackles next year."
6737,2020-12-12 05:43:54,kaoj0b,That's Elway fucking the team over on his way out.
6738,2020-12-10 23:26:07,kaoj0b,No problem man. Appreciate the effort
6739,2020-12-10 23:35:15,kaoj0b,2 playoff appearances in 8 seasons it‚Äôs been time for Telesco to go.
6740,2020-12-10 23:38:37,kaoj0b,No offensive minded HC for once please. Our last 3 since marty have all been offensive guys. We need a defensive guy.
6741,2020-12-13 04:19:37,kaoj0b,Feels like Carr might've fucked a lot of the opposing fans' wives back in his college days. So many people don't even care to put in the effort to look at him objectively at all.
6742,2020-12-11 18:36:02,kaoj0b,"I don't see the Bucs letting Godwin go. He excels from the slot anyways. Golloday would be amazing. Really curious whether he will be available. He seems a bit disgruntled right now and Stafford's contract skyrockets next year so they'll cash-strapped with a lot of defensive pieces to resign. On the other hand, they only have like 2 WR's signed through next season"
6743,2020-12-11 01:04:41,kaoj0b,"That's fair. I think the general consensus in the Jets subreddit is that we definitely need another WR. Mims is definitely promising but isn't quite WR1 yet.

I think it is entirely possible that we sign a free agent WR and draft another WR with a lower pick. I've also seen us drafting a WR with our Seattle 1st. I find it interesting trying to understand why one path over another."
6744,2020-12-11 01:25:14,kaoj0b,"Allen Robinson will be our biggest non O-line priority I believe. I think we sign him, take a WR in the first or second, keep Crowder, and resign Perriman. WR has been a HUGE problem for us and we desperately need to flood the position with talent."
6745,2020-12-10 23:29:40,kaoj0b,"I don‚Äôt really think Gus is the problem. So much of our defense has missed serious time this year. Look at how well the defense did in the first half of games, then compare it to the second half when they get burnt out"
6746,2020-12-12 18:44:37,kaoj0b,"Passing on Wilson is debatable, I'd say.  If he'ss till available, I'd prefer to trade down if the offer is decent.  We need more depth."
6747,2020-12-12 18:49:11,kaoj0b,"My doubt is more because of position than anything. I think the community in general overblows this idea that Belichick doesn't pay FAs, but he's been willing enough to do so when he feels the value is there e.g. Gilmore, Revis, Thomas, Harrison. We just haven't invested in keeping/adding DL since Vince and Belichick has turned the position group into this rotating, adaptive mass of role players. I just expect to see a couple of guys signed for for ~$7-8m combined rather than big money at a better player in Barrett. 
  
I really just wish we had re-signed Trey Flowers in 2019. The cap would have been tight and we'd have had to pass up on a couple FAs, but it was doable and he was such a perfect fit."
6748,2020-12-10 22:51:17,kaoj0b,Yeah I get that. I do agree with most of your picks as well (except for the qb in the sixth). I would love Ja‚ÄôMarr Chase no matter who plays an for us next season.
6749,2020-12-12 16:33:11,kaoj0b,"That wasn‚Äôt what I said? Coming up, as in we need to pay them"
6750,2020-12-11 01:12:58,kaoj0b,Probably due to akiem hicks being out right?
6751,2020-12-11 04:51:10,kaoj0b,Yeah that‚Äôs understandable. It‚Äôs entirely possible Elway passes on a QB as well. Me personally feeling it would be a mistake doesn‚Äôt mean much.
6752,2020-12-11 17:51:59,kaoj0b,"I think a lot of people simply don't know he'll be draft eligible after this year. He's the only DL finalist for the Outland trophy and a semi finalist for the Bednarik and Nagurski trophies. His season stats compare favorably to Aaron Donald's 2013 stats and he's a 6'3"" 305 pound DT with crazy burst and motor."
6753,2020-12-12 21:01:05,kaoj0b,At Pick 4 in the draft (right now) the Cowboys are in an interesting position to get Zach Wilson or Trey Lance. I think either of those qbs could be just as competent as Dak.
6754,2020-12-11 06:09:48,kaoj0b,"Those rumors don‚Äôt exactly come from the most reliable source, but it is likely. They were definitely close to retirement anyway."
6755,2020-12-11 13:58:50,kaoj0b,Losing Thuney is inevitable
6756,2020-12-11 04:39:31,kaoj0b,"I‚Äôm done saying what the Chiefs will or won‚Äôt do. I vociferously argued there was no way they‚Äôd select a RB in the first last time. Corner made too much sense. I‚Äôm not convinced RB was worthy of that selection, but it showed me I have no clue about what they care about."
6757,2020-12-11 14:23:47,kaoj0b,So was mariota
6758,2020-12-11 13:02:22,kaoj0b,"Interesting, you think he‚Äôs only good because he get bailed out by derick Henry??"
6759,2020-12-11 13:05:32,kaoj0b,"I could absolutely see him going for a late first, especially when there are so many teams (NO, PIT, TB) with old qb's they need will soon need a successor for.  Its easy for me to see teams still value darnold for his college tape (which i think is still better than anyone not named Lawrence or Luck in the last 10 years). Its also easy to see other teams value his age (younger than burrow) and can blame some of his problems to adam gases scheme that criminally plays against sams strengths (he shines in an uptempo offense that flexible enough to let him scramble and make plays).  And I think is easy to think a few organizations who see all this will be willing to bid Sam's value up higher than alot of the pundits at r/nfl could fathom.  

Remember alot of people on reddit thought we wouldn't get more than a 3rd rounder for Jamal."
6760,2020-12-14 16:57:36,kaoj0b,the rumor mill says he‚Äôll get back a 2nd and a 5th and JD got two firsts and much more for Adams when people thought he couldn‚Äôt get a first.
6761,2020-12-15 14:45:13,kaoj0b,"I think you‚Äôre both right. It‚Äôs impossible to predict really. I think a third is the pessimistic view, first is quite optimistic, second seems like a pretty fair assumption for mocks imo"
6762,2020-12-11 21:04:39,kaoj0b,That's understandable and in that scope then I can understand the Harris pick-up a little better.
6763,2020-12-12 14:58:46,kaoj0b,"I understand that sentiment for sure, but I will say recently Achilles injuries are seeing many more full recoveries. It definitely impacts longevity, but modern surgery and rehab seems to be able to get athletes with Achilles injuries back to 100% with much more frequency"
6764,2020-12-11 13:30:02,kaoj0b,"If they have Fuller and Pittman they don‚Äôt have to depend on Campbell to stay healthy, but if he is healthy then the rookie you just drafted is not going to see much action"
6765,2020-12-12 15:02:11,kaoj0b,A 3rd would be cheap for darnold for the amount of upside you‚Äôre getting though and he‚Äôs 23. He hasn‚Äôt looked great this year but was 7-6 as starter last year on a bad team and looked great his rookie year. As a jets fan I think whoever gets him has a steal.
6766,2020-12-10 23:45:24,kaoj0b,"It‚Äôs not an offensive or defensive thing. What matters is getting a good coach. McCoy rode Manning‚Äôs coattails into a HC job. Lynn was a freaking RBs coach, not even a play caller. We haven‚Äôt gotten an innovative offensive mind under TT. 

Arthur Smith, Joe Brady, and Daboll are offensive minds that all have their own two legs to stand on. They actually call plays and are significant reasons the offense took a step forward. McCoy was just a mistake like Gase was disguised by Manning and Lynn wasn‚Äôt even hired to be an offensive mind. Whisenhunt maintained his spot as OC and play caller when he got hired for a reason."
6767,2020-12-12 17:47:55,kaoj0b,"That exhibits a failure to make necessary adjusts in my mind, especially in-game adjustments."
6768,2020-12-12 17:08:32,kaoj0b,"Sorry, my bad. You said we were losing valuable veterans on the roster and mentioned Alexander and Adams, so I must have misread what you meant."
6769,2020-12-11 01:13:41,kaoj0b,hicks was playing and stafford dropped 400 yards on us
6770,2020-12-11 14:02:06,kaoj0b,I concur. Still hurts though
6771,2020-12-11 13:04:04,kaoj0b,No I think he's incredible. I'm just being an asshole bc I don't want him to leave :(
6772,2020-12-11 13:58:38,kaoj0b,"Jamal was always clearly worth a 1st plus some more. Any team that takes Darnold is taking him for the reasons you described, but they‚Äôll get him as cheap as they can given his struggles and lack of progression. A 1st just seems like an overpay for a QB with a losing record and more INTs than TDs. And I say this as someone who loves Darnold and believes in his future"
6773,2020-12-12 15:04:13,kaoj0b,Not if he is a shit-tier QB I wouldn't give up more for him than I would for case keenum at this point darnold is as good as hot garbage
6774,2020-12-11 00:01:57,kaoj0b,God I hope we hire Arthur Smith. Very balanced offense that get's production out of every position group. Big fan
6775,2020-12-11 00:01:00,kaoj0b,I want saleh for that reason. He is a damn good coach and didn‚Äôt ride Pete Carroll‚Äôs coattails into  his DC position in SF
6776,2020-12-12 16:52:25,kaoj0b,"I‚Äôm liking daboll more and more recently, I think his play calling with the bills is really solid, and TT has ties to buffalo and building something like what they have would be our best bet imo"
6777,2020-12-12 17:50:32,kaoj0b,"What adjustments are you supposed to make that would make Emeke Egbule, Brandon Facyson, and Jesse Lemonier into good players? Coaching can‚Äôt fix everything. It‚Äôs completely unrealistic to expect any defense to hold good offenses to single digit points in both halves"
6778,2020-12-11 01:14:16,kaoj0b,Damn. That‚Äôs not good.
6779,2020-12-11 14:02:52,kaoj0b,"Yeah, it does. But think about that 2022 3rd round comp pick"
6780,2020-12-12 18:07:44,kaoj0b,"Jesse Lemonier has played 7 def. snaps, Egbule has played 34 def. snaps (25 against NOR), Facyson has played 41 def. snaps (25 against NOR and 15 against DEN). These guys aren't the issue. Are injuries an issue? Absolutely. But there's enough talent there to hold these good offenses to few points in the first half. If there isn't enough depth to execute your scheme through 2 halves then you need to adjust your scheme. I'm not a coach, I don't know the adjustments that should be made, but it's literally Gus Bradley's job to figure that out. Bradley and Lynn may very well be hamstrung by this limited roster or they may just be too stubborn and lack the creativity to make the most of what they have. I've come to lean toward the latter."
6781,2020-12-11 01:21:25,kaoj0b,"yeah bears defense regressed a lot the past few games, just when offense figures it self out"
6782,2020-12-12 18:09:36,kaoj0b,"So yeah, you do expect teams to hold the saints or Bucs or chiefs to single digit points in both halves. You‚Äôll never be satisfied with that mindset

Ironically, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd be much happier if the team was giving up 14 in both halves vs 3 in the first and 25 in the other because that‚Äôs different somehow?

Ever consider how the offense completely going to sleep in the second half has an effect on the defense?"
6783,2020-12-11 01:25:12,kaoj0b,Us chargers fans our stuck in 2010 with a top 10 offense and defense but we have a dogshit special teams and a HC who can‚Äôt coach his way out of a paper bag
6784,2020-12-12 18:40:17,kaoj0b,"Ok, I'm not saying that they have to hold good offenses to uncharacterstically low outputs in both halves. What I expect is more consistency, especially considering Bradley's been here for 4 years and most of the players lining up are veterans.

To consistently give up few points in the first half then 20+ in the second half the way we do is different. If it were just a handful of games throughout a season, then you could say it's negligible. But to consistently have that occur week after week should be concerning for you.

I do consider the failings of the offense. I understand that the offense sustaining fewer drives means the defense is on the field more. That's definitely a factor. But then are you implying that anytime the offense falters, we should just accept defeat and never expect the defense to step up?

Do you believe that Bradley isn't to blame at all? Yes, players aren't executing on the field, but when that's a chronic issue that falls onto coaching."
6785,2020-12-11 01:29:32,kaoj0b,"yep both bears and chargers don‚Äôt got the best coaching staff right now but we have one thing in common, good 2018 season"
6786,2020-12-11 01:31:53,kaoj0b,And people in my respective fan base are still holding on to that year as a reason to keep the current HC
6787,2020-12-11 01:36:11,kaoj0b,"yep, hurts even more when he won coach of the year"
6788,2020-12-11 01:43:23,kaoj0b,We might have similar problems with ownership too. We hate the Spanos family just as much as you hate the mccaskey family
6789,2020-12-11 01:44:56,kaoj0b,"at least you had qbs, rivers and herbert looking really good. best in bears history is either some guy in the 40s or jay cutler. bears have never had a 4000 yard passer"

He was abandoned by his family, dropped into a racist country where black people are killed by the police just for being black. His family is sooo technically powerful, yet they sit and do nothing. 

his plan was to return to his homeland, take rightful control, and do something about racial injustice. 

The way he wanted to do that was to provoke a race war by injecting weapons into racially divided countries. that plan is unnecessarily violent (hence why the black panther finds a better route), but the point is valid.

I personally liked him because he wasn't necessarily wrong, his violence was just unacceptable due to the loss of life. Unlike Thanos who's logic wasn't sound, Kilmonger's method has been used many times in real life. He's only a villain because it's been told from the view of the ones with something to lose, much like how America is the villain to the Middle East. He essentially forced us to realise that sometimes our anger results in us taking it out on the innocent due to our limited vision. However it doesn't make the anger any less valid. 

Maybe you're not understanding it because you're a little removed from the issue it was representing."
6830,2020-12-06 20:46:11,k7z4eg,"Yeah when the movie first came out I saw articles stating that it was the greatest live-action comic book villain performance since Heath Ledger as the Joker. When I went to see it in theaters, it wasn‚Äôt even good. I don‚Äôt really get too invested in people‚Äôs opinions on entertainment but that shit pissed me off. Whoever had the balls to write that deserved to be fired."

6832,2020-12-06 22:04:37,k7z4eg,"I think it was just part of the insane hype that surrounded this film. Before it was even released it already had a 100% rating on rotten tomatoes. People just decided that it would be amazing. 

Personally I think the movie has some cool aspects but is really average by superhero movie standards. Killmonger has a good setup with his backstory but they don't do anything with him beyond that backstory. It may motivate him, but they don't show you how he went from losing a dad to deciding to start mass genocide. It's just ""he's angry now"" and that's how he is in every scene.

Also it's just so ridiculous that they let this dude from NY waltz into a country he's never even been in and they're all like ""yeah he's king now *shrugs*"""

6834,2020-12-06 20:19:55,k7z4eg,I like Killmonger. I love MBJ. I've never heard or read anyone talk about Killmonger before this post.
6835,2020-12-06 21:38:26,k7z4eg,I hated the movie and the villain...but I loved the costumes and hair. The movie was just so full of angry clich√©s.
6836,2020-12-06 23:53:11,k7z4eg,You‚Äôre definitely missing something
6837,2020-12-06 22:10:23,k7z4eg,"I agree that his backstory gives him a good setup, but the plan he makes didn't make me doubt who was wrong or right at all.

Let's fight racism with... More racism? Maybe it's just me but it makes him seem pretty dumb for not noticing the hypocrisy."
6838,2020-12-06 20:48:55,k7z4eg,"Almost every villain has a motive or ‚Äúpoint‚Äù to their actions, there are very few who are just evil for the sake of it; that doesn‚Äôt make him unique in any way. He was honestly really bland and generic, and I like Michael B. Jordan."

I also kept expecting him to yell ‚ÄúFlame on!‚Äù and fly out of there, so maybe I‚Äôm not the best person to opine on the topic."
6843,2020-12-07 02:52:04,k7z4eg,I think it was more so you could sympathize with why he felt angry not because you agree with his plan.

6846,2020-12-07 06:13:09,k7z4eg,"The difference between these two is that we actually find out more about Thanos as time goes on. He repeatedly shows that (even though his plan doesn't make any long term sense) he's an incredibly smart and powerful enemy that can't be underestimated. Every time they think they're going to beat him, he ends up winning. Besides that he's also not a one-note character. He's not just a stoic conqueror in every scene he's in. You find out that he truly cares about his daughters, that he can be downright kind with little kids and so on. Killmonger isn't a bad villain because he has poor motivation but because he ends the movie exactly how he started it."
6847,2021-01-01 21:12:32,k7z4eg,Yeah but he's also a shallow villain

6943,2020-12-06 00:06:40,k77lqo,"Goddamn it seems clear they wanna use Doctor Strange 2 as a pedestal to unite all sorts of webs and weaves of plot lines they got going on, almost like a Civil War team up. That's awesome but I really would've loved Scott Derrickson's horror vision for it."
6944,2020-12-06 00:15:11,k77lqo,"Can we have this as a pinned post, updated as we move ahead"
6945,2020-12-06 00:27:07,k77lqo,Thank you so much for this! I desperately wanted to find a timeline. This is so exciting and gets me HYPED for more Marvel to consume my life.
6946,2020-12-06 00:47:13,k77lqo,"WOW (Owen Wilson reaction), what a compilation. Excellent work, OP.

Based on absolutely nothing but my own wants and needs (and other people have certainly noticed the similarities before), I low-key hope (and this is off-topic to Marvel but not Disney) that Sebastian Stan has secretly been filming for The Mandalorian for a younger Luke Skywalker under the guise of Falcon & The Winter Soldier. Would be such a cool shock to see."
6947,2020-12-06 02:32:48,k77lqo,"I don't think Awkafina as Fah Lo Suee was ever confirmed, only rumoured"
6948,2020-12-06 05:26:22,k77lqo,"Thanks for this. It's nice too see all the available info in one place without a ton of useless chatter to pad out a ""news"" story.

It's sad, but I'm definitely going through MCU withdrawal. Today I have watched Doctor Strange, Civil War, Infinity War and I'm just finishing Endgame. At least it gives me some feeling of normalcy with everything going on in the world right now."
6949,2020-12-06 05:33:47,k77lqo,"Sees Owen Wilson included in the cast.

Me: Wow!"
6950,2020-12-06 05:35:41,k77lqo,"Thanks for compiling these, while I will see them all (the movies at least), I am most interested in what will happen with the X-men and the Fantastic Four and hope we get a morsel of info on these at some point, there has been nothing other then an easter egg in the 'Miles Morales' game..."
6951,2020-12-06 07:55:35,k77lqo,"Such a long list, and the only thing that gave me actual chills was that one line near the end: ""Fantastic Four (TBD)""

Powerful words...."
6952,2020-12-07 10:45:02,k77lqo,My stunt casting theory back in like 2018 was Harry Styles as Adam Warlock and holy fuck it looks like I got pretty close
6953,2020-12-09 15:46:50,k77lqo,"wow i kinda dipped out after ffh so this is a nice way to catch up on any new announcements, owen wilson in loki is certainly a surprise"
6954,2020-12-11 06:53:18,k77lqo,I believe they updated Captain Marvel 2‚Äôs release date to Nov. 11/22
6955,2021-02-28 13:48:48,k77lqo,[removed]
6956,2020-12-05 15:14:54,k77lqo,I really hope RDJ isn‚Äôt in black widow
6957,2020-12-05 15:23:15,k77lqo,"Good job, thank you for the no-clickbait. 
It's a good read!"
6958,2020-12-05 15:47:36,k77lqo,"Thoughts on M'Baku becoming the new Black Panther? 

Duke has had more movies come out recently. I thought he was great in that movie with Mark Wahlberg. Can't remember the name.

In my mind, since he ended up helping at the end of Black Panther, he'd be the logical choice to take over. 

I know people say Shuri, but I want her to become the Marvel genius that is building everything and improving everyone's tech, and kind of take over for Tony."
6959,2020-12-05 15:34:35,k77lqo,"What If? is, by it's very nature, non-canonical, but I'm definitely looking forward to it.

Maybe they can do some What if the tv division wasn't ignored by the inferior movies?"
6960,2020-12-05 15:23:08,k77lqo,"What are the odds we‚Äôre headed toward a live action spider-verse? I know it‚Äôs unconfirmed but with Jamie Foxx coming back, Strange being in it, and all the casting rumors, things to seem to be hinting that way."
6961,2020-12-05 15:42:44,k77lqo,"That was genuinely helpful and very informative, thanks for taking the time to put it together!"
6962,2020-12-05 16:09:01,k77lqo,"I really hope Deadpool stays out of MCU canon. I love the film, but I think one of its strengts is commenting on other franchises, companies, canons by being an outsider to most of it."
6963,2020-12-05 15:57:44,k77lqo,Going to be interesting to see if they keep the Shuri actress now that she‚Äôs come out as a anti vax Terf.
6964,2020-12-05 15:34:01,k77lqo,Good work kind sir!
6965,2020-12-05 15:43:06,k77lqo,S
6966,2020-12-05 15:48:43,k77lqo,Do we know if Chadwick recorded his lines for What If before he passed?
6967,2020-12-05 16:05:05,k77lqo,I still dont get how they are going to tie in non mcu franchises like dead pool? Are they not connected to the first movies? Or will they just destroy the integrity of the whole mcu? Same if they do a spidey cross over to venom or the old spidey. Seems like a slippery slope imo to just start bringing in storylines that are not a part of the mcu.
6968,2020-12-05 16:08:36,k77lqo,"I really want more information about Moon Knight. And last I heard Oscar was just ""in talks"". I wish we could get as much updates with it already like the Hawkeye series, it's my most anticipated D+ show."
6969,2020-12-05 16:19:51,k77lqo,Any word on Galactus? I'd love to see him show up one day
6970,2020-12-05 16:20:31,k77lqo,wasn‚Äôt Ms. Marvel said to be on track for airing in late 2021 since filming started recently? or at least rumored to be airing sometime that year
6971,2020-12-05 16:26:45,k77lqo,"One really small thing, there is no X-Men movie announced, Kevin said that they would bring in mutants but never specified beyond that."
6972,2020-12-05 16:31:06,k77lqo,The casting for Black Panther 2 also includes Tenoch Huerta (Rafa Quintero - Narcos Mexico) as the unknown villain https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/marvels-black-panther-sequel-shoot-to-begin-in-july-exclusive
6973,2020-12-05 16:51:42,k77lqo,Is there no confirmation for Linda Cardellini in Hawkeye? I can‚Äôt imagine she wouldn‚Äôt be in that. Interesting!
6974,2020-12-05 16:56:30,k77lqo,Didn‚Äôt Tatiana Maslany say she wasn‚Äôt going to be She-Hulk?
6975,2020-12-05 17:02:36,k77lqo,I can see Christian Bale playing Dario Agger in Thor since he was the main villain of The Mighty Thor series.
6976,2020-12-05 17:21:25,k77lqo,god i am so looking forward to all of this
6977,2020-12-05 17:25:11,k77lqo,If they don't put Thunderstruck over the final fight in Love and Thunder I'm starting a petition
6978,2020-12-05 17:32:49,k77lqo,"Wunmi Mosaku is in 'Loki' (source: the pap pics from March) & the same goes for Neil Ellice. 
Jack Veal and Cailey Fleming are strongly rumoured to play Young Loki and Sylvie (source: their instagram activity and interaction)"
6979,2020-12-05 17:37:20,k77lqo,"Ah shit, the WHAT IF, is going to be animated? Guess I should have known."
6980,2020-12-05 17:42:20,k77lqo,"To me... A lot of this sounds like a huge buildup to the ""No more mutants"" moment."
6981,2020-12-05 17:51:58,k77lqo,"Let‚Äôs hope no one dies

Imagine the tragedy if Samuel L Jackson dies before wrapping the whole thing up, I‚Äôd be devastated"
6982,2020-12-05 17:57:56,k77lqo,I could be wrong but I thought Jamie Foxx said that he would be playing Electro again - just with redesigned CGI so he‚Äôs not blue
6983,2020-12-05 18:04:03,k77lqo,This is incredible work!!
6984,2020-12-05 18:19:50,k77lqo,Lotta shit gonna be our next year.
6985,2020-12-05 18:20:08,k77lqo,Is it just me who thinks Adam warlock will be (one of) the villain(s) of love and thunder?
6986,2020-12-05 18:21:17,k77lqo,I‚Äôm very surprised they‚Äôre continuing with another black panther movie... they must be convinced they can successfully write the late Mr. Boseman out of the story. I wonder if another character will become the black panther.
6987,2020-12-05 18:21:22,k77lqo,"Idk if this would go under Doctor Strange, Captain Marvel or just ‚ÄúOther‚Äù

But it‚Äôs all but guaranteed that America Chavez is apart of Phase 4/5. With the biggest rumor being she‚Äôll be appearing in Doctor Strange. And the most likely rumor being she‚Äôll have a crush on Captain Marvel. 

Idk how substantial the rumors will be but the 2nd comes from a source that has already had a few Disney rumors come true. 

Could also note that with Kate Bishop, Ms Marvel, and America Chavez all confirmed that means one of the untitled Marvel Productions could easily be Young Avengers. (Obviously that part is clearly a big IF but still)"
6988,2020-12-05 18:26:56,k77lqo,i‚Äôm super excited to see the marvel what if‚Äôs! hope it‚Äôs really campy lol
6989,2020-12-05 18:30:35,k77lqo,"As an agents of SHIELD fan, it's so disappointing every time I look at the future titles that Marvel's putting out and I don't see any of them lol"
6990,2020-12-05 18:31:31,k77lqo,"Has it been reported or confirmed that Chadwick Boseman's lines for What If? have been recorded? If so, can anyone please provide a source."
6991,2020-12-05 18:37:28,k77lqo,"They should absolutely take the original black panther 2 script and turn it into a ""What If?"" If they are doing a complete rewrite and not just replacing him with shuri and co. Also surprised they didn't have a backup script already, seeing as his cancer and decline was known to the studio and fellow actors."
6992,2020-12-05 18:41:15,k77lqo,Wait so I thought Deadline confirmed the Kang casting?
6993,2020-12-05 18:49:03,k77lqo,"Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but wasn‚Äôt Chris Hemsworth was confirmed to be in GOTG 3?"
6994,2020-12-05 18:55:07,k77lqo,Christian Bale as Beta Ray Bill... whoa. I know nothing about Beta Ray Bill but sounds fuckin awesome.
6995,2020-12-05 19:04:11,k77lqo,"If those dates hold, 2022 is gonna be on üî•(though I doubt that we‚Äôre getting that many movies in one year)"
6996,2020-12-05 19:07:20,k77lqo,Lots of movies in 2022. Almost too many. I love marvel but I don't want to get lost in the shuffle.
6997,2020-12-05 19:10:07,k77lqo,I didn‚Äôt realize MCU fans were gonna be eating this well in 2021! So many shows and movies after a year of none. Can‚Äôt wait!
6998,2020-12-05 19:28:26,k77lqo,"Has it been stated that What If? is canonical?

I was under the impression it was the first official non-canonical MCU property."
6999,2020-12-05 19:34:21,k77lqo,The sheer amount of acting talent is so impressive.
7000,2020-12-05 19:34:37,k77lqo,"It wouldn‚Äôt be a black widow movie without Hawkeye, especially the Budapest part"
7001,2020-12-05 19:34:43,k77lqo,Wasn‚Äôt Jared Leto‚Äôs Morbius(?) part of the MCU or not?
7002,2020-12-05 19:50:08,k77lqo,Neither Deadpool 3 nor Blade have confirmed release-years.
7003,2020-12-05 19:51:03,k77lqo,Do we know if Chadwick Boseman recorded lines for What If? before he passed?
7004,2020-12-05 19:52:12,k77lqo,"Forgot Erin Kellyman as Songbird in Falcon & Winter Soldier, she was spotted on set so it's confirmed. Same goes for Clint's family in Hawkeye"
7005,2020-12-05 19:55:02,k77lqo,"2020 was a tough drought. Thankful for AoS ending so well but can‚Äôt wait for the splurge of content hitting us in 2021 and then not slowing down again. 

I hope Feige and others don‚Äôt burnout once things pick back up."
7006,2020-12-05 20:03:39,k77lqo,"Wow lots of cool stuff here that I had no clue about.

Evan Peters as Quicksilver in Wandavision? That‚Äôs really crazy and I‚Äôm curious if he‚Äôs somehow going to be a continuation of QS from the X-Men movies? His version of QS and the Deadpool franchise characters are the only confirmed uses of FOX‚Äôs X-Men characters under Marvel Studios correct? Really interesting.

I feel like Spider-Man 3 is gonna be *weird* (in a good way) if Dr.Strange, Foxx‚Äôs Electro, and the two previous Spider-Man‚Äôs are all gonna be in it."
7007,2020-12-05 20:06:09,k77lqo,"I can't believe we have to wait till November next year to see Eternals. Sigh, that's my current most hyped upcoming marvel movie"
7008,2020-12-05 20:14:19,k77lqo,There is no end to this. If there's not a movie to watch there's probably a show. It's gonna get real difficult to keep up with this now. But if movies are released on Disney+ then people will stay subscribed for years without having to worry about content.
7009,2020-12-05 20:29:02,k77lqo,"Great write-up. The only thing I would add, with a disclaimer, are Wardell scoops."
7010,2020-12-05 20:34:30,k77lqo,"Budapest must be told as a story, because as far as I'm aware Jeremy Renner isn't in the movie, so it wouldn't make sense to do a flashback"
7011,2020-12-05 20:39:27,k77lqo,I‚Äôm really excited for Eternals.
7012,2020-12-05 20:42:49,k77lqo,Can we take a moment to appreciate so many actors remaining in this long-running series for so many years? It just wouldn‚Äôt be the same without them.
7013,2020-12-05 20:45:51,k77lqo,This is incredible! Thanks for doing this. One quick note would be to mention that Sam Raimi is directing the next Dr Strange film as its kindova cool link to the previous Spiderman iterations- albeit probably unrelated to the story or characters.
7014,2020-12-05 20:54:53,k77lqo,*Loki* sounds like it could be *Doctor Who*-esque

Soooo....... we're gonna get a bottle of water onscreen? :)"
7016,2020-12-05 21:08:54,k77lqo,2021 is going to be very busy
7017,2020-12-05 21:18:14,k77lqo,I hope Oscar Isaac gets the role of moon knight I think he‚Äôd be great
7018,2020-12-05 21:20:29,k77lqo,Christian Bale casted in Thor love and thunder we just don‚Äôt know as who yet. Hopefully Gorr
7019,2020-12-05 21:21:36,k77lqo,it makes me so happy that with pretty much every actor in hollywood getting a role in the MCU tom cruise still hasn't got his murder cult stink over it.
7020,2020-12-05 21:25:52,k77lqo,"Meh. I think I‚Äôm done, to be honest."
7021,2020-12-05 21:29:53,k77lqo,"Ms. Marvel is shooting as we speak in Atlanta. How do I know this for 100% fact? My dad, who retired a few years ago, decided he wanted to sign up to be an extra in various productions. He was in an Aretha Franklin docuseries as a priest in the background, and a few weeks ago he was a Muslim mosque-goer for - guess what - Ms Marvel. 

They had all the extras wearing those little bracelets like the Lance Armstrong on that say Jersey. I know this because he gave it to me and now I‚Äôm never taking it off. 

He said he saw the actress playing Ms Marvel on the set, but wasn‚Äôt in a scene with her.

I should note the filming took place in a church or mosque in East Point Atlanta."
7022,2020-12-05 21:31:04,k77lqo,"I‚Äôm so psyched for What If, even more so than the other series. But the three listed premises are totally uninspiring imo, especially the zombie one. There‚Äôs so much cool stuff that could be done with it."
7023,2020-12-05 21:31:11,k77lqo,2022 looks amazing. Waiting for Black widow in 2021 seems like the low bar.
7024,2020-12-05 21:45:04,k77lqo,Great post.  Thank you for collating all that information.
7025,2020-12-05 21:49:32,k77lqo,I find the lack of Defenders...  disturbing.
7026,2020-12-05 21:52:25,k77lqo,"Assuming nothing gets pushed back further, 2021 seems jam-packed with Marvel. Although Black Widow seems a little too near in the future.


Also, I forgot we were getting Blade!"
7027,2020-12-05 22:15:10,k77lqo,Seems unlikely that Chadwick Boseman is gonna be in the What If show

7031,2020-12-05 22:58:10,k77lqo,"Am I the only one who would be at the very least interested in seeing Killmonger be brought back as an *incredibly* reluctant protector to Wakanda without taking over the role of Black Panther per se? Probably I wouldn‚Äôt have wanted that if Chadwick Boseman hadn‚Äôt died, but the character was so good and redemption wasn‚Äôt out of the question."
7032,2020-12-05 22:59:03,k77lqo,ah. mostly shit.

7066,2020-12-05 19:19:17,k77lqo,Spider-Man 3. It was basically confirmed by Sony Latin America that the Spider-Verse is happening with Toby McGuire and Andrew Garfield returning as their respective Spider-Man. I believe the video was already taken down but it's was confirmed by their Twitter account that it was an official Sony TV spot.
7067,2020-12-05 15:31:31,k77lqo,"Why can't anything be a surprise anymore?  RDJ will appear, Rick Grimes will leave the show, etc."
7068,2020-12-05 15:44:07,k77lqo,Also  J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson for Spider-Man 3. And wasn't Alfred Molina seen on set as well?
7069,2020-12-05 17:17:08,k77lqo,"First off‚Äî thanks so much for doing this. This is awesome. 

I‚Äôm not sure if this is worth adding, but there were rumours for Doctor Strange 2 also featuring Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield as part of the cast with Ryan Reynolds. Is this worth adding to the ‚Äúrumoured‚Äù portion of the post? 

If not, since the involvement of these two pre-Holland Spider-Man actors has been continually mentioned, there‚Äôs a chance it could just be in Spider-Man 3. (Yet I think DS2 is a better chance since it‚Äôs a multiverse storyline)"
7070,2020-12-05 17:23:59,k77lqo,Didn't you forget Morbius? For 2021 I believe unless that's not under the MCU.
7071,2020-12-05 23:08:31,k77lqo,All of this and no Hulk huh?
7072,2020-12-06 00:09:46,k77lqo,I feel they‚Äôre going to figure out a way for lupita nyong'o to be the next black panther. She's a bigger name and the recent controversy with Letitia doesn't help much either.
7073,2020-12-05 18:10:13,k77lqo,"like 3-4 of these hold any interest for me and the rest seem like Agents Of Shield-tier filler

prove me wrong, Disneybots"

7075,2020-12-05 20:06:49,k77lqo,"Regarding She Hulk I read an article a while back from We Got this Covered and said by Grace Randolph from Beyond the trailer. That the show will feature multiple ""hulks"" possibly Ross turning into Red Hulk, Abomination return, and Bruce coming in for either a cameo or mentor role. You can obviously look more into this online but I trust Grace Randolph as a reporter. 

Also small thing Florence Pugh will also be in Falcon and Winter Soldier."
7076,2020-12-06 03:44:58,k77lqo,"My theory is Loki winds up worthy enough to wield Mjolnir. 

Also hyped about Spidey 3. With Wanda and the Multiverse being a thing, and the previous Spider-Man actors along with a previous villain reprising his role, I really want to see them show up as Spider-Man"
7077,2020-12-06 04:19:29,k77lqo,"I‚Äôm glad hardcore Marvel fans are getting all this, but I‚Äôm also kind of glad that my and my friend‚Äôs interest in this universe died after Endgame. 

Idk man, I just don‚Äôt have any desire to see anymore- it‚Äôs like RvB after season 10 to me. 

Hope it‚Äôs just as good as all the other 10 years of stuff for y‚Äôall!"

7080,2020-12-05 18:21:49,k77lqo,"The whole thing reads like a huge mess, in part due to all the 2020 delays and in part due to the on-screen death/retirement/nerfing of Iron Man, Widow, Cap, and Hulk (who‚Äôve been our anchors to this universe) and the real-life loss of our Black Panther. 

Here‚Äôs hoping Marvel Studios/Feige can pull something worthy of the mantle together out of what currently reads like a lot of loosely connected odds and ends."
7081,2020-12-05 17:35:06,k77lqo,Its kind of disappointing some of these shows aren't progressing the overall plot in the universe. What's the point of Wandavision?

7117,2020-12-06 09:20:36,k77lqo,"Though no directors are mentioned on your post, I think it‚Äôs relevant to add that Sam Raimi is confirmed to head Doctor Strange 2 after Scott Derrickson dropped out. This also substantiates the idea of a horror plot lurking beneath the surface of the movie due to Raimi‚Äôs specialty (and passion) for horror.

Also, I‚Äôve been avoiding rumors for a while now so I can‚Äôt tell you if either of these are debunked or even maybe less proeminent, but i vaguely remember Krysten Ritter being rumored to also be in the Captain Marvel cast as well as Charlie Cox on Spider-Man 3. Thought that might just be because people want those so badly they talk about it too much and I‚Äôm mistaking wishful thinking for rumors."

7130,2020-12-05 21:21:06,k77lqo,"I actually think covid and this enforced hiatus between Endgame and the start of the new phases is a boon for the MCU. Allows the general audience some down time from the movies and gives Marvel a chance to really work on their plans and make sure they've got everything as tight as can be.

Also allows for mutant planning and gave them some breathing room with BP2 after Boseman's death."
7131,2020-12-05 18:56:21,k77lqo,It will be nice when we get SIX movies in 2022 though. We will have forgotten all about not seeing them for awhile and then will have one every 2-3 months after Black Widow drops (save the 4 month gal between Shang Chi and Eternals).
7132,2020-12-05 21:46:13,k77lqo,Black Widow could easily be streamed on Disney+ so idk why they didn‚Äôt just release it there. If Warner bros is releasing all the movies on HBO Max why can‚Äôt Disney release one movie?

7145,2020-12-06 02:11:03,k77lqo,Did the director not say when Chadwick passed that he had to throw out the script he was working on?
7146,2020-12-05 17:27:42,k77lqo,"They've confirmed they aren't recasting T'Challa, nor using a CGI Chadwick, so they've got a lot of modification to do. May as well count it as a new script."
7147,2020-12-06 07:52:18,k77lqo,Feige said at SDCC 2019 that some of it would be mid-blip & some of it would be post-blip.
7148,2020-12-05 19:53:23,k77lqo,"between wanda vision and the second dr strange movie, i feel like phase 4's big plot point is going to be the multiverse, with my guess is that using the infinity stones twice [one to wipe out half the universe, and again to wipe the stones out] then the time travel to use the stones again [one to reverse what thanos did, and two, to wipe him and his entire empire from existence] i have a feeling that such massive manipulations to the powers that govern all of reality are going to affect the multiverse in unpredictable ways"

7173,2020-12-05 16:01:55,k77lqo,Very controversial opinion! Time will tell I supppose
7174,2020-12-05 17:14:38,k77lqo,Zombie Captain America and Captain Carter could lend itself to the possibility that he doesn't have a voice part in either episode
7175,2020-12-06 01:26:39,k77lqo,You're welcome. Thanks for saying thanks
7176,2020-12-05 15:32:26,k77lqo,"Complete rumours mate, nothing substantiated"
7177,2020-12-05 17:48:01,k77lqo,"Yes. I think what some 'spoiler free' people have problems with is some of us like knowing things ahead of time and approach it with more of a 'How are they going to pull THAT off?' anticipation. We're more interested in how things fit together rather than in any big surprise. I don't know if that makes any sense to the 'no spoilers under any circumstance' fans, but it is what it is. 

So for me, anyway, knowing something ahead of time ruins nothing for me."
7178,2020-12-05 17:35:22,k77lqo,"I don't to be honest, I prefer as much surprise as possible, but it's been that long since we've got anything I needed something substantial, hence this post. Once things start coming back out consistently, I'll stop listening to rumours"
7179,2020-12-05 22:03:48,k77lqo,"I personally hate it, and it does affect me when it's played out on screen.

Example, I had no idea Falcon was gonna be in Ant-Man until I saw Ant-Man. It was a huge deal, I was NOT expecting it.

But imagine if I did, instead I would have been like ""There he is. Just as the internet said."" instead of ""WOAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!""

The unfortunate thing is that this is super rare nowadays, because of leaks and stuff and then people spread it around. 

But thank you very much for the surprise, it's the effort that counts. I just wish someone would catch whoever leaks it in the first place. Breaking NDA's are not cool."
7180,2020-12-05 19:15:32,k77lqo,"Unless it's a huge spoiler, like Kylo killing Han (which was spoiled for me), then I don't mind them too much. Seeing it actually happen, how it's tied into the story, and the fall out from it, is usually the best part."

7182,2020-12-05 13:59:53,k77lqo,"#Ms. Marvel (Early _2022_)

Not much is known about the 5th Disney+ show on the slate, other than it will introduce Kamala Khan to the MCU, rumoured to be a coming-of-age story set in her high school years.

Casting calls have gone out for Red Dagger, however a casting announcement is yet to happen

Other casting includes:

- Iman Vellani (Kamala Khan)
- Zenobia Shroff (Muneeba Khan)
- Laith Nakli (Sheikh Abdullah)
- Matt Lintz (Bruno Carrelli)
- Yasmeen Fletcher (Nakia Bahadir)"
7183,2020-12-05 15:20:21,k77lqo,"In the comics, Carol Danvers was Ms Marvel for years, and another character was capt marvel. She eventually took over the Capt marvel title.

A few years ago they added a new character that was a teenager that looked up to her, and took over the name Ms Marvel. They're really pushing her as the new spiderman (""the"" teenage character in marvel). She's in the disastrous Avengers game that came out a few months ago. Stretchy powers, I think. I've never really read any of her stuff, but I think people generally like her."

This article confirms he is in the movie, but much like the Loki casting, there isn't anything definitive to say who he will be playing"
7188,2020-12-05 17:08:08,k77lqo,"Chances are they won't be, but these are the most recently confirmed dates, some not updated for post-COVID"

7190,2020-12-05 19:22:15,k77lqo,"I'm REALLY hyped for Shang Chi, and still advocating for an homage to the wushu films of the 1970s."
7191,2020-12-06 01:39:44,k77lqo,In the comics Black Widow was born shortly before WW2. She has very slowed aging. In one memorable issue Wolverine and Captain America rescued her from a Hydra base at the direction of Nick Fury (all of which were active during WW2).

7213,2020-12-06 08:14:35,k77lqo,"Yeah, I don't recall any confirmation of who she's playing in the movie."
7214,2020-12-11 08:47:22,k77lqo,"Thanks, I'll update this post asap"
7215,2021-02-28 13:59:40,k77lqo,"I'll probably update this after WandaVision finishes, can't see too many eyes getting on this post anymore though"
7216,2020-12-05 15:38:11,k77lqo,"Why? It takes place between CA:CW and Infinity War, it would make sense that he‚Äôd at least make a flashback appearance or a very brief cameo."
7217,2020-12-05 16:32:08,k77lqo,some are saying it is a cameo like in some detailed news clip or something like that.
7218,2020-12-05 17:40:49,k77lqo,"The rumor was that they had a deleted scene from Civil War, so technically RDJ's final appearance as Stark would still be Endgame, as the BW appearance would have been films years ago."
7219,2020-12-05 15:49:20,k77lqo,"Given the Letitia Wright controversy at the minute, it seems like the best course of action to me"
7220,2020-12-05 16:52:18,k77lqo,"At this point, I‚Äôd love alternate universe MBJ that was raised in Wakanda. M‚ÄôBaku would be cool too though."
7221,2020-12-05 17:15:50,k77lqo,MBaku would be one buff a** BPanther and i love it. Would also love for him to return to CW BPanther without as much tech help. Make him a beast of a fighter.
7222,2020-12-05 16:49:11,k77lqo,"Pretty sure it‚Äôs canon, just different universes than the main timeline."
7223,2020-12-05 15:40:40,k77lqo,"But with the exploration of alternate timelines in Avengers: Endgame, those other timelines are technically canonical in the multiverse"
7224,2020-12-05 15:30:22,k77lqo,"I'd say eventually, I'm holding out hope they won't rush it into this one though, maybe set it up though"
7225,2020-12-05 17:16:27,k77lqo,"Completely agreed. It also wouldn't make much sense for them to make Deadpool 3 an MCU movie since they wanna keep the PG-13 rating which would ruin the character. And if they decide to make it an MCU movie, even if it was rated R, parents would see it and think it'll be family friendly like the other marvel stuff and take their kids to see it. I don't think marvel would wanna make that sacrifice so it seems more likely that it will stay in a different universe. Not to mention Josh Brolin playing both Thanos and Cable in the same universe."
7226,2020-12-05 16:01:15,k77lqo,"She's deleted her account, I imagine she'll come back having learnt her lesson and a heartfelt apology and a renegotiated contract"

7228,2020-12-05 18:08:20,k77lqo,Apparently so
7229,2020-12-05 16:12:08,k77lqo,"Likely alternate timelines, I imagine MoM will help them explain it away"
7230,2020-12-05 16:35:23,k77lqo,"I'd say Phase 5 at the earliest, after F4 and XMen have been introduced"
7231,2020-12-05 16:36:42,k77lqo,"Last we heard from Feige, he said after Hawkeye, and with that show being pushed back to late 2021, I took an educated guess at 2022"
7232,2020-12-05 16:40:16,k77lqo,"Yep, I said at the bottom there that the names of the movies may not be ""X-Men"" and ""Fantastic Four"", but they will feature characters from those series"
7233,2020-12-05 16:41:08,k77lqo,Added!

7238,2020-12-05 17:39:43,k77lqo,Thanks! Could you link a source for me? I've had to add and delete few pieces taken from comments already
7239,2020-12-05 18:19:31,k77lqo,"Technically he is playing Electro again, but whether it's a reboot of the character or not, is unknown"
7240,2020-12-05 18:22:13,k77lqo,"I think they'll make a killing, if not just from morbid curiosity"
7241,2020-12-06 08:10:19,k77lqo,"The show ended very well. I'd love to see somebody come back in a cameo or supporting role, but they don't need their own project anymore."
7242,2020-12-05 18:40:56,k77lqo,Apparently there was never a script pre-Chadwick's passing
7243,2020-12-05 18:41:45,k77lqo,"Did they? I didn't see that, could you link it and I'll add it?"
7244,2020-12-05 19:01:30,k77lqo,"I don't believe so, Chris Pratt was confirmed for Thor 4 but if you have a source I'll add it!"
7245,2020-12-06 08:11:45,k77lqo,"Given GotG 3's troubled history (it was intended to be the first film after FFH until Gunn's temporary firing), it's highly *likely* that he was *originally* going to be in it, but we've never had any confirmation."

Thank you for subscribing to Fantastic Four Facts"
7263,2020-12-06 11:10:26,k77lqo,"They have to keep the franchise running for as long as they can, they way I see it they'll complete a few arcs of the heroes we know and love before throwing failsafes into the mix, they know even the casual fans will go and see X-Men return to the mix, so they may as well leave it as long as they can

But they'll all have crossover characters and linked storylines, you don't have to, but you should"
7266,2020-12-06 11:15:39,k77lqo,"Unlikely, source and I'll add it"
7267,2020-12-06 11:19:15,k77lqo,"Chances are, all those UMM will go to the TBDs, everything above is likely all we'll see, for Phase 4 at least

I‚Äôm allowed to have a different opinion, fuck off."

7293,2020-12-05 16:51:18,k77lqo,2026 is kind of a stretch.

Much like the character himself, the plot of the show is relatively unknown, however it is confirmed to be an origin story, due to the fact that the character isn't widely known.

Oscar Isaac has been tapped to play the multiple personalitied character, with no other casting known"

7332,2020-12-06 07:46:43,k77lqo,It‚Äôs ironic how I think Chris Evans made a great Human Torch and an iconic Captain America.
7333,2020-12-06 11:36:24,k77lqo,It was above all else fun and entertaining. Was it a cinematic masterpiece? No. But damn if I didn't enjoy the hell out of it.
7334,2020-12-06 07:11:24,k77lqo,I don't quite understand how either of those make sense to cast. Neither seem like they could fit the roles they're getting.
7335,2020-12-06 07:49:50,k77lqo,A lot of the guys who've already done franchise roles don't wanna come back for another multi-picture commitment; they're happy with a one-&-done.
7336,2020-12-05 15:11:38,k77lqo,"I believe that‚Äôs her name in the closed captions for the trailer, whether or not that means she‚Äôs ‚ÄúAgatha Harkness‚Äù is still speculation."

7338,2020-12-05 16:08:20,k77lqo,She's credited on IMDB as Agnes
7339,2020-12-05 17:48:44,k77lqo,This was in the recent Entertainment Weekly cover article about Wanda Vision
7340,2020-12-05 19:43:01,k77lqo,"I think they‚Äôre just guest, not main characters"
7341,2020-12-05 16:09:35,k77lqo,Plus probably trailers for Dr Strange and Spider-Man and others :(
7342,2020-12-06 03:12:00,k77lqo,Agreed. Can you imagine if covid hit right before End Game?
7343,2020-12-06 07:47:08,k77lqo,We're not getting 6 films in 2022.
7344,2020-12-05 21:59:05,k77lqo,I think they used Mulan as a test run and it didnt do well enough to do the same for Widow. Warner bros has to do it because they‚Äôre running out of money wheras Disney can probably sbsit off their savings for years.
7345,2020-12-06 00:18:45,k77lqo,"There are a few independent channels on youtube who talk about exactly that. The general consensus is that they would only make a fraction of the money by putting it on vod directly.

Imagine this: you want to watch the movie with your friends, it's in cinemas - you *all* buy a ticket. But if it's on vod, one person pays for it and the whole group can watch. Also there are a lot of people who watch movies a second or third time, so they buy a second or third movie ticket. But if you rented it on vod, you can watch it as often as you want within 48 hours and pay only once.

There's also other more profound reasons I think, but I just remembered the ones who are most relatable to myself"
7346,2020-12-05 20:41:35,k77lqo,"Methinks the team of Sam and Bucky will be ‚ÄúCaptain America‚Äù - CA is no longer a single person, but an ideal to strive towards"
7347,2020-12-06 01:44:34,k77lqo,There was no rumour about passing the mantle between Bucky and Sam. In fact it's mo≈ôe about dealing with Walker and Sam be coming Cap. Bucky has nothing to do with that since He has to reclaim his identity and deal with his past. Endgame was pretty clear of who will be Cap but we need to see it.
7348,2020-12-05 19:14:09,k77lqo,Just like the original Avengers.
7349,2020-12-05 16:55:28,k77lqo,Thanks for the effort have a nice day. Maybe eat something nice

7352,2020-12-05 17:01:31,k77lqo,I‚Äôm confused by this as the initial post says without click bait or rumours but when reading the post I came across several times you stating it‚Äôs a rumour
7353,2020-12-05 17:15:59,k77lqo,Idk why you would put that in and not Tobey/Andrew returning in Spider-Man. Both are equally unsubstantiated.
7354,2020-12-05 17:39:19,k77lqo,"‚ÄúWithout the clickbait, ads or rumours‚Äù he said and the Wandavision part begins with a consensus guess about the plot and the last paragraph is a rumour. Liar."
7355,2020-12-06 02:11:56,k77lqo,"No, I haven't seen anything like that, he just said he was writing lines for T'challa..."
7356,2020-12-05 17:41:46,k77lqo,When did they confirm they wasn‚Äôt recasting T‚ÄôChalla?
7357,2020-12-05 18:02:37,k77lqo,Apparently they never had a script ready pre-his passing
7358,2020-12-05 16:40:07,k77lqo,"Also, you wrote a group of ""Celestials"" instead of Eternals, Celestials are their creators."

7360,2020-12-05 16:23:55,k77lqo,Dang.  Dog's name is Pal but I have no clue where I caught that...  :(
7361,2020-12-05 15:38:13,k77lqo,Ah ok. Then yea it is likely going to be the first phase 4 movie set in 2023.
7362,2020-12-05 17:26:33,k77lqo,"You might be correct but the point would still stand that it would be the first movie set in the ""modern day"" of being post Endgame.

But also, it is possible that Endgame could have taken place in early 2023 and the events of Far From Home still took place in 2023. I don't remember if they say what time of the year it was."
7363,2020-12-05 17:32:36,k77lqo,I just looked it up and I think you might be right. The events of Endgame seems to end in the fall of 2023.
7364,2020-12-06 03:46:02,k77lqo,"Its very possible that the film will show a few different point in time (since intro films typically show the hero growing up or something similar) but I think the bulk of the film takes place post Tony's snap.
 Although I won't be upset if they have it take place during that 5 year skip."

7366,2020-12-06 15:45:52,k77lqo,"Hollywood Reporter‚Äôs sources stated that Ant-Man 3 was slated for a 2022 release, and this extra October 7th date will definitely be for Ant-Man 3.

There is nothing for Blade. There‚Äôs been no movement on that project so far aside from Mahershala Ali‚Äôs casting and the official logo. No director, no writer, no release windows, nothing.

Safe to say Blade will be a 2023 release."
7367,2020-12-06 07:55:12,k77lqo,I don't think they ever announced a date for Blade at all; people just assumed 2022 because it was the first year with open dates.
7368,2020-12-05 18:34:45,k77lqo,"Evan Peters played Quicksilver in Sony's X-Men franchise. Frankly he was pretty amazing at it, and he was far stronger than MCU's limp-dicked Quicksilver. They're speculating that because he's in Wandavision, he's playing an alternate version of her brother. 

Seems doubtful, since Sony's Marvel properties don't mix with the MCU."
7369,2020-12-05 16:27:34,k77lqo,Where‚Äôs your proof?

7373,2020-12-05 20:24:54,k77lqo,"Well that‚Äôs good to know. I honestly get the most frustrated for the fans because I fear their experience won‚Äôt be as amazing as we want it to be but if it truly doesn‚Äôt ruin it for some, that‚Äôs all we can hope for."
7374,2020-12-05 20:22:57,k77lqo,"I understand, we are a little behind schedule now but we are cranking them out very very quickly! Hang tight :)  I‚Äôm very excited for some things to come."

7376,2020-12-05 15:37:27,k77lqo,"Some very solid casting choices here. Zenobia was great in The Big Sick, and Laith is excellent in Ramy. However, he's playing a character who couldn't be more unlike Uncle Naseem and I think that's awesome."
7377,2020-12-05 15:38:03,k77lqo,"She‚Äôs pretty well liked as far as I can tell. I think she‚Äôs pretty neat, at least."
7378,2020-12-05 23:47:23,k77lqo,shes represting the muslim demographic since her creator is from new jersey and the writer is a muslim as well they go in depth about it on the new marvel 616 documentary series. very informative and cool.

7381,2020-12-05 19:03:11,k77lqo,Rather complicated. Long story short: market saturation and market homogenization
7382,2020-12-06 12:04:46,k77lqo,But she was born in 1984 in the mcu.
7383,2020-12-05 18:14:34,k77lqo,Also everyone remember GOTG3 was supposed to have a 2020 release.  We were never supposed to be teased about ‚ÄúAdam‚Äù for this long.

7391,2020-12-05 16:42:45,k77lqo,"The end to his character was so well done, I think any extra appearance would weaken it. I don‚Äôt want Tony‚Äôs final appearance to be a black widow cameo lol, I want it to be endgame"
7392,2020-12-05 19:19:48,k77lqo,"My favorite suggestion I've heard so far, if Wright were to be removed from the series, was to set the story in 2023-2024, reveal that the character of Shuri was never snapped by Thanos as originally believed, age her up to adulthood (and recast her), and introduce the new version of her as BP after opening the movie with a funeral ceremony for King T'Challa."

7397,2020-12-05 20:46:10,k77lqo,Thanks. I've read about him before just don't remember the details. Just seems like him and Christian Bale would make a really cool combo.
7398,2020-12-06 08:09:39,k77lqo,What one? Am I forgetting something?
7399,2020-12-05 19:31:34,k77lqo,"That's not how canon works.

It's non-canonical unless we hear otherwise. 

We haven't had any mention of it being in the multiverse."
7400,2020-12-06 03:13:55,k77lqo,"Fair enough, though I don't think the Blade source is very reliable."

As for Hawkeye's family, they're [here](https://twitter.com/JRennerNet/status/1334970951814049792?s=20), and I also forgot about Echo in Hawkeye, played by [Alaqua Cox](https://www.murphysmultiverse.com/exclusive-first-look-at-alaqua-cox-as-echo-in-hawkeye/)"

7403,2020-12-05 22:51:38,k77lqo,"Ya. For phase 3 I was pumped for everything. Even after many of my friends had stopped caring about the movies.

But now I guess things have changed. I can imagine not having time to watch everything and all the other things I want to do/watch. So I guess I'm just expecting to not be able to enjoy marvel stuff as much as I used to and will have to really prioritize things."
7404,2020-12-05 23:06:49,k77lqo,"> When Waititi was doing press for Thor: Ragnarok, he told Screen Rant that he'd want to make Thor: Ragnarok 2, not Thor 4. If he and Marvel envision Ragnarok as a soft reboot and start of a new trilogy, then Thor 5 is where Waititi and Hemsworth could bring the character's story to a close.

This doesn't say there is any evidence there will be a trilogy. It's just speculation based on the idea that if Love and Thunder is ""Thor: Ragnarok 2"", there must be a ""Thor: Ragnarok 3"""

7406,2020-12-06 12:00:45,k77lqo,Feige never said TFATWS is connected to BW. That is made out of the fact Ross appear most likely in both and his nickame is Thunderbolt. They might forming a team.
7407,2020-12-06 11:58:39,k77lqo,TBDs? To be determined? And yeah I guess anything beyond 2022 will be considered Phase 5.

7409,2020-12-06 21:26:21,k77lqo,"I more meant adopting a film series that isn't part of their continuity and continuing it rather than the use of numbers in their titles. Calling it Deadpool 3 very much links it to the previous deadpool films which were made by a different studio. I assumed it would be a bit of a soft reboot.

Sorry I wasn't clear enough. Obviously I'm aware of the already existing MCU films with numbers in the title, but cheers."

The article you linked me, which only links to the original Deadline article as a source, says (as I said earlier) only that ‚Äúhe‚Äôll appear in the film‚Äù without proof, without some other source confirming it, honestly making it look more like a mistake or misunderstanding that everyone‚Äôs running with. It‚Äôs the equivalent of gossip in middle school. I like your list but you listing it as ‚Äúall but confirmed‚Äù is VERY far from the truth bro"
7435,2021-03-06 20:30:50,k77lqo,I'll be waiting :)

7440,2020-12-05 22:22:24,k77lqo,"That's awesome. Then that was probably the one thing I read here I didn't know (besides a few castings for auxillary characters). Right now I'm deep in the rumors, and with what you know I'd love to hear your thoughts on that. Maybe in another post? I actually have major theories and rumors regarding Black Widow, WandaVision and Spider-Man and I'm curious if what you know confirms or denies it. My theories have only been getting an increasing amount of rumors supporting them too. Let me know if you're interested, I'm sure you're bombarded with responses right now. My biggest interests in these theories are the introduction of X-Men and The Sinister Six."

Anyways maybe it's a hot take but I prefer to wait a few months so I can watch it in theaters"
7451,2020-12-06 03:52:21,k77lqo,"One thing great about seeing a movie in theatres is you cannot pause it and you cannot delay it to take your mind out of it for a phone call or to look at your phone during a pause. It is a full experience that you cannot really control.

You cannot rewind the film and rewatch an action scene real quick to catch all the detail - it is just in your face full ride, no pause, just go. This makes me experience a movie better in theatres and pay close attention because there is no doover except going back to the theatre to watch again (which I do with movies full of details and thrills).

A movie theatre experience is so much better for me just for that reason, let alone hearing gasps when insane things happen like Thanos ripping off the surface of a moon for a final fantasy ""meteo"" attack!!!"

However the last paragraph isn't a rumour, it's the last thing Feige announced at Comic-Con"
7459,2020-12-05 17:58:53,k77lqo,"A few weeks ago. I believe Victoria Alonso (One of the big producers at Marvel) said it. Give me a moment, I'll try to find the link.

Edit: [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/jtk7n4/marvel_studios_executive_producer_victoria_alonso/)'s a reddit thread with the link to the article (which seems to be in Spanish) where she at least implies that T'Challa will be dying, too. Not 100% confirmation, but implied."

7544,2020-12-05 19:41:11,k77lqo,"Fair enough, thanks! I'll add it"
7545,2020-12-05 23:40:52,k77lqo,"I think he is. There's a short clip of him in the first trailer, but not any of the other Avengers. Even though it's (I think) from Avengers 1, I doubt they'd have shown his face (and paid him for it, no doubt) without him having *at least* a cameo. Same with Fury."
7546,2020-12-05 19:51:34,k77lqo,These next few years are gonna be so epic dude.
7547,2020-12-05 20:39:15,k77lqo,"That‚Äôs lame...I feel like we should get a proper sequel to FFH, possibly including set up for a Spider-Verse event and then the fourth movie should be the big Spider-Verse crossover movie. Going straight to Spider-Verse feels lame with zero set up. As weird as it feels to be rooting against such an amazing concept, I hope the extent of Tobey and Garfield‚Äôs involvement is just a tease for a fully fleshed out Spider-Verse movie later."
7548,2020-12-05 18:38:10,k77lqo,Just ignore him. You‚Äôve put a load work into this and it‚Äôs very clear when stuff is rumoured and how reliable it is. Great work
7549,2020-12-06 11:03:31,k77lqo,They said recasting is off the table
7550,2020-12-05 17:34:52,k77lqo,Its crazy that they decided to do another jump right away.
7551,2020-12-05 16:51:13,k77lqo,Haha very true. Thanks for all the info.
7552,2020-12-05 18:39:51,k77lqo,Any idea when we'll get to find out publically or when a scoop may drop?
7553,2020-12-05 16:18:42,k77lqo,"The same source who claimed about Evan Peters, the first one who broke out the footage of Hawkeye. The most reliable I think.

Also Ryan Reynolds is a speculation/theory by fans"
7554,2020-12-07 03:18:28,k77lqo,I didn‚Äôt know Blade was set for 2022. I thought it would release in 2023 or 2024 as a part of Phase 5.
7555,2020-12-05 23:56:56,k77lqo,"Problem with that is, Marvel might be a lot more cautious to wanna set up a 4th film given there‚Äôs no guarantee they‚Äôll even get to do one. It‚Äôs *extremely* possible that the current contract between Disney and Sony may not get renewed again."
7556,2020-12-05 18:41:21,k77lqo,Cheers bro
7557,2020-12-06 11:20:51,k77lqo,"No, Where are U getting all this from, Give me a Source? Sorry, but U sound seriously uninformed...They never denied recasting, it's one of the major thing in consideration tbh, why would that be off the table, Atleast Source your claims...

Because They only officially said CGI-ing Chadwick is completely off the table..."
7558,2020-12-05 17:35:42,k77lqo,"Yeah, it really is. And now Hawkeye is taking place at Christmastime 2024. The MCU just keeps getting farther ahead of us"
7559,2020-12-05 16:52:48,k77lqo,No problem. We‚Äôre in for a treat with this show
7560,2020-12-05 18:54:39,k77lqo,They were very angry it got out earlier this year so I would say we won‚Äôt hear anything until the show airs. They viewed it akin to baby yoda reveal and wanted it a surprise.
7561,2020-12-05 16:29:31,k77lqo,I'll add it as a rumour!
7562,2020-12-06 00:01:59,k77lqo,"Oh I assumed that the spider verse push came from Sony rather than Feige. Because Feige seemed to be setting up the Sinister Six, although I guess the Sinister Six could work as Spider-Verse villains."
7563,2020-12-06 13:26:12,k77lqo,">‚ÄúNo. There‚Äôs only one Chadwick, and he‚Äôs no longer with us. Sadly, our king has died in real life, not only in fiction, and we‚Äôre taking a little time to see how we continue the story and how to honor this chapter of what has unexpectedly happened to us, so painful and terrible to be honest,‚Äù Alonso said. ‚ÄúChadwick wasn‚Äôt only a wonderful human being, every day of the 5 years we spent together, but also, I believe, that what he did as a character elevated us as a company, and has left his moment on history.‚Äù

7564,2020-12-05 17:39:22,k77lqo,Yea its insane. But maybe by getting so far ahead they will able to be less concerned about the strictness of the time-line going forward?

7566,2020-12-05 16:49:11,k77lqo,"Hi, did you put characters too? Because Clea and Brother Voodoo are supposed to appear in Doctor Strange 2. We just haven't found out about the casting yet."
7567,2020-12-06 00:04:27,k77lqo,"To be honest, it could go either way. But regardless, I‚Äôd think Feige would be very reticent about designing a movie with set-up for a direct sequel in that fashion given the nebulous possibility of a sequel he has control over. Sort of like an ‚Äúif you‚Äôre gonna do spider-verse, I‚Äôm going to make sure it‚Äôs done right!‚Äù Sort of thing.
Edit: also yeah, I get the feeling they might be doing a Sinister Six deal plus Spider-verse deal. But we‚Äôll see how it all plays out. I have faith in the writers, though!"
7568,2020-12-06 13:32:25,k77lqo,"Yeah, I read that full message, nowhere it's written that we are not considering any recasting, because this message clearly not stating at any point that they completely denying a recast and that's it's off the table...they clearly said they're taking a little time to figure out how to continue...

Also, Sorry, if it come off as rude, English isn't my first language, It didn't meant that to be rude tbh, if words came out like that, I'm sorry, bud...I always believe in a healthy discussion/conversation..."

7574,2020-12-05 17:45:13,k77lqo,I dont disagree with you on that. But having it set less in present day could make things easier if they are going to go heavy on the cosmic side of things.

7659,2020-12-04 21:42:06,k6jv87,"Look at you, challenging my comment ;) I'm pretty firm in my 6 wing haha"
7660,2020-12-04 19:12:48,k6jv87,"Sweet of you to worry about invalidating others feelings on the character, but I think you'd have a hard time doing this unless you made it personal somehow. üòä I like talking and hearing others perspectives on fictional characters enneagram types whether we agree or disagree because if we both relate to a character, it offers a point of understanding to other type structures without being directly vulnerable. I think there's something beautiful about that. 

So... thanks for sending! I liked your post, it definitely argued well that Elsa isn't a 9 (I agree, so much so I'd question the 9 wing) and highlighted those points above, but a lot of your arguments for 5 seem true of all competency group members that suppress emotions to an extent and tend towards usefulness, and so I related to it all too, as a 1.  I won't get into specifics unless you want me to, but if you have more 1v5 things I'd be interested!

I actually think -and I dont say this lightly- Elsa's character arc between the 2 movies is perhaps the best type-1 self-realization story in popular fiction. I've felt this way for a while - ""let it go"" is my go-to song for making a mistake and disintegrating to 4 and I cry tears of joy when I hear ""show yourself"" and feel like I can actually be myself without hurting everyone. If I'm being honest, I doubt you could really convince me she's a 5, but I do like hearing where the relatability is either way and try to keep an open mind. I definitely don't want to invalidate your connection or passion with the character either. 

I actually am now inspired to write a post about why her story is the perfect 1 story arc, to me (I'd write now but I wanna give it more thought, its like a journaling exercise to share) If you're interested stay tuned and feel free to tear into it or share unrecognized 5ness within it üòä"
7661,2020-12-04 15:37:49,k6jv87,"Ooh I love that explanation and I can totally relate.  It makes me think of how I got into meditation.  I had just read so many studies that had that positive results on meditation or mindfulness techniques that I just had to try it.  I‚Äôve loved it ever since.

Also I think I get the explaining part.  My favorite way to teach complex ideas is with analogies.  I think a good analogy is the best bridge to meet someone where they‚Äôre at."
7662,2020-12-04 22:16:45,k6jv87,Didn‚Äôt you challenged mine first?
7663,2020-12-04 20:35:31,k6jv87,"Ahhh I see. Well, I don‚Äôt like to push onto posts where someone feels so strongly about something that there‚Äôs not really a chance of changing that opinion. Which I don‚Äôt think you meant negatively, but posting is a great thought exercise and I don‚Äôt want to rain on that. (Edit: But I‚Äôm sure I will enjoy reading it‚ÄîI haven‚Äôt heard directly from 1‚Äôs feelings about how they go to a growth space).

That‚Äôs tricky because I can see what you‚Äôre saying from a 1 perspective. Since 1s go to 7 in growth and 5s go to 7 in stress, I can see some overlap perspective there. The growth of Elsa that I focused on was her willingness to start being vulnerable (with Anna), expand her inner circle (to include Anna not just herself), step into leadership (assert herself in general), make decisions (instead of shutting down/shutting out) and tap into her gut feelings instead of just her head as she especially does during the second movie. These are all specific changes she has to make for growth and it‚Äôs very 5‚Äì>8 in strength to me. 

Let it Go is a really, really touching scene for a lot of people! The emotional aspect of it is relatable. To me, the way she handles it, that was needed self-discovery, but her motivations were fear and withdrawal and she goes chaotic (like 7 stress for us). So it‚Äôs not a health/growth experience. She‚Äôs not handling things productively at that point. Throughout the movies, I see her stepping up in 8 strength more than continuing to live in that ‚Äúlet it go‚Äù or a 7 space.

I never really considered her being a 1 because I think she‚Äôs strongly in the fear triad. Not just because of circumstances and her past, but because it‚Äôs core to her personality and motivation. She verbally and nonverbally references fear a lot; she‚Äôs either withdrawing/pulling away out of fear or running towards something to face a fear. And I don‚Äôt see patterns of that with anger at all as a reactive or core emotion for her. 

I, too, cry hard during Show Yourself. That we can at least agree on‚Äîit has a very 4 vibe!"
7664,2020-12-04 17:24:42,k6jv87,"Yes! Analogies are very helpful. I think with 5s, it‚Äôs a problem of accumulation. One of our biggest strengths is observation and we live in our head so our minds are just constantly connecting data points. When we get interested in something, we dive into it more and it can be very, very hard to retrace all of those thought trees and explain it to others sometimes. And then we circle back to things because we‚Äôre constantly remembering important details. It always feels like trying to cram a dissertation into a few paragraphs, so we‚Äôre very happy when others try to understand!"
7665,2020-12-04 21:37:48,k6jv87,"You're not wrong about any of this - she is fearful, she isn't reactive, she doesn't trust her gut, and she has to get past it. And I can see and appreciate the 5 there definitely, because on an enneagram growth structure level, you struggle with this the most. But, every type let's some type of fear get in the way of following their gut-- ie, their truest selves. Its the sorta bigger picture beyond that that defines type. The gut triad doesn't do this less, they're just more aware of their gut reactions and their ""truth""... such that the fear seems like more of an obstacle we are possibly unaware of than a state of being. It doesn't mean it makes it easier to follow it just because we ""know"".  In fact, it's incredibly difficult feeling like we know things that make no rational sense. The entire 1 struggle is one of rationalizing -overthinking- doing what we feel we should. We literally stop trusting life and ourselves and follow our critic, a head space, convincing ourselves we are following objective logic because we discount everything that makes us us. 

But... there's subtleties beyond the above that make me feel it's 1 rather than 5, because from above it could easily be either which is actually really cool.   So this needs a more emotional analysis. And certainly with the right logic or emotional depth-and if there exists sufficient evidence to suggest I am wrong- you COULD change my mind, but you'd likely have to bring in some pretty deep insight into the core fear 5 issues -like, more vulnerability than I've ever seen from a 5 or most 5 literature - to do so. I would love to see you do that even if you dont share. But, I think in this case it would be pretty hard with rationalized logic to convince me because there is too much my own subjective experience being rationalized with type structure, like I could take your entire argument above and replace the numbers and tweak a few words to argue 1 and it would end up making your entire argument above make more sense to me but less sense to you. But certainly I would enjoy you perturbing my certainty, so don't hesitate ;) ill let ya know when I post it!"
7666,2020-12-04 19:05:51,k6jv87,I feel like you‚Äôve described living with ADHD.  Lol
7667,2020-12-04 22:14:45,k6jv87,"Hmmm. I can see we‚Äôre not going to have a very productive conversation. Because it sounds like you‚Äôre saying, that because you have such a subjective attachment to it, you‚Äôre not going to be able to agree with other rationalities. Maybe I misunderstood the second part, but that was confusing and seems like you‚Äôre trying to strong arm me because you really, really believe you are ‚Äúright‚Äù and I don‚Äôt sense open mindedness.

I disagree that you can take the points I said and switch the numbers 1 and 5. That sounds like some fundamental misunderstanding of 5s. Your first paragraph is something I‚Äôve considered before, every type does deal with those issues, but to me, that is not a sufficient argument to explain Elsa‚Äôs big picture and little picture behavior which is always tied to fear. That‚Äôs why I was explaining it from a motivational standpoint that is a theme/pattern for her whole storyline (and without enough anger or shame‚Äîespecially anger‚Äîto center her in another triad). 

I wasn‚Äôt using logic, actually, just an all around assessment of her as a character."
7668,2020-12-04 23:01:48,k6jv87,"I'm sorry if my vagueness is upsetting, I'm really not meaning to strong arm you, I'm trying to be upfront that I am not prepared to have rational debate about it because of my own bias rather than insisting I am right indirectly. But I would like to, once I've put my perspective into words because I haven't given you my side of the argument ie my ""big picture"" which I see as different from your big picture development takeaway all together. 

Anyway, sorry about that. I probably should have kept it to myself."

7697,2020-12-02 13:05:13,k578pv,"Not gonna lie it absolutely blows my mind how you made a huge deal about her complimenting you like it was a bad thing. It might be because we live in entirely different parts of the world, but beautiful doesn't sound genderspecified or feminine to me; it's an adjective we use to express admiration, and she did just that.

Let it fade, it will probably be back to normal soon, but she might find it hard to express the feelings she has towards you with the same words as before, and this feeling might make her a tad bit uncomfortable for a while."
7698,2020-12-02 14:14:37,k578pv,"So I read the replies and I have a totally different take on it. 

If someone was calling you a nickname or something you didn't like, it would be totally okay to ask them not to call you that. I see this in the same way. 

I'm a woman and I wouldn't like to be called pretty during sex. For me, the word reminds me of my kids. Them bringing me a pretty rock. Them seeing a pretty dog. Them thinking that the new librarian was pretty. For me it's a word I've heard my children use so often in a very innocent way that hearing it during a sexually charged moment would just feel strange. 

I would brainstorm with her and come up with things you both like. Good luck.

ETA: Okay, the more I think about this the more it bothers me. If a trans man or a trans woman came on here for advice and said that their partner was using terms that they felt didn't fit their gender identity, no one would tell them just to suck it up because the word had no gender. But because a cis man didn't feel comfortable with being called adjectives that traditionally describe women, he should just get over it. It's a troubling double standard."

7743,2020-12-01 22:13:32,k4v36r,"This team is just slowly eroding my health, just end me, life is suffering even in victory /s"
7744,2020-12-01 22:36:16,k4v36r,I hate and love being a fan of this team at the same time.
7745,2020-12-01 21:54:51,k4v36r,We had to Pazza things up in the end. Why do they have to test my heart for a full 90 minutes every time?
7746,2020-12-01 21:56:07,k4v36r,"I can't write nothing lmao I'm exhausted, jesus man"
7747,2020-12-01 21:58:45,k4v36r,One of these matchday 6s has to go our way right?
7748,2020-12-01 22:00:25,k4v36r,"With Shakhtar's victory over Real, we now have a very good possibility of advancing to the group stages given that we win our final game. 

If both Real and Inter win game 6, we will advance over Borussia on head to head record. If Borussia wins, we will advance over Real in point difference. The worst case scenario will be a draw between Real and Borussia, or a draw/loss for us. But given that it is a true make it or break it final match, I think a draw will be very unlikely next week. We just can't bottle it against Shakhtar. Forza Inter. 

Btw, I gotta say, Conte did very well this match."
7749,2020-12-01 22:05:04,k4v36r,"I almost got heart attack for their third goal, thank god for VAR!"
7750,2020-12-01 22:10:45,k4v36r,"Craziest group I can remember, Shaktar concedes 10 goals against Gladbach and then goes on to win against Real"
7751,2020-12-01 21:59:04,k4v36r,"That ball that Lukaku took from in front of Bastoni killed me. If he left it, we would be done and I wouldn't stress my heart so much."
7752,2020-12-01 21:59:19,k4v36r,So you‚Äôre telling me there‚Äôs a chance
7753,2020-12-01 22:01:47,k4v36r,Very important win! I have trouble remembering the last time Inter did not lose/tie a must-win match. I wish though that the team was a bit less pazza and a bit more consistent
7754,2020-12-01 22:02:26,k4v36r,"So what do we need next week? Obviously a win vs Shakhtar but we go through as long as the other game is not a draw, correct?"
7755,2020-12-01 22:05:09,k4v36r,"Andiamoooo we are still in this!

I think something changed, especially in defense, after the real loss. We still have severe dips in performance throughout the game where we don‚Äôt seem to be able to string passes together anymore, but overall there seems to be a definite improvement. We‚Äôre not passing the ball around their box as much either and getting caught on nasty counters.

Now we need to win against Shakhtar and hope the other two don‚Äôt tie. CREDIAMOCI"
7756,2020-12-01 21:54:12,k4v36r,"Jesus that was a tough game to watch but great play by the boys. 

We live to fight another day."
7757,2020-12-01 21:54:32,k4v36r,Just whew
7758,2020-12-01 21:59:38,k4v36r,Damn Plea I was going for 1-3 and ended 2-3
7759,2020-12-01 22:00:28,k4v36r,Just had a few heart attacks in the games. It‚Äôs all good.
7760,2020-12-01 22:01:11,k4v36r,"Wew. Created a lot of chances, but on the other hand they were almost all counters (if they'd closed down a lot, I think we'd have seen ""hoof to lukaku"" a lot more) and we still wasted a ton of them. Lukaku immense, Brozo great as well, Alexis came in just at the right time. Good to see Hakimi get an assist and Darmian get his goal. Lautaro was limp and we nearly paid an enormous price for his waste. Young...lol.

Our second goal was against the run of play and we weren't looking great after the break, but we did well to follow it up with the 3rd...if only we'd not sat back like idiots we'd have avoided all of this drama.

Overall ok performance, at least this one is over. Onto the next. Forza Inter!"
7761,2020-12-01 22:05:34,k4v36r,"Given we defeated Monchengladbach.....


we ‚ÄúCAN‚Äù do it! ü§îüòâüòâüòâ"
7762,2020-12-01 22:11:06,k4v36r,"Its a good win, but don‚Äôt get too much hype guys. We cannot decide the outcome. We can only go through if we beat Shak (wont be easy) and BMG and Real beat each other. Lets be positive regardless of result."
7763,2020-12-01 21:55:12,k4v36r,"YES!!! finally got some luck, hmm\~"
7764,2020-12-01 21:57:58,k4v36r,We stay alive
7765,2020-12-01 21:58:56,k4v36r,PAZZA INTER AMALAAAAAA
7766,2020-12-01 22:14:07,k4v36r,when was the last time all 4 teams can still go through on the last matchday?
7767,2020-12-02 05:41:46,k4v36r,Felt a little like Kyiv
7768,2020-12-02 07:07:06,k4v36r,"Not an Inter supporter, though I respect and enjoy watching what you all are doing over there, but I had to drop by this match thread to say that its a crime that Lukaku isn't being mentioned more in here. Every SINGLE touch the man made was immaculate, his one touch layoffs and holdup play were unbelievable, godly, I can't come up with enough superlatives to describe how he played. It was a joy to watch and as someone who has followed his career for a while its so nice to see him blossoming at a great club like Inter and doing all the things he's capable of. The way he used the ball in this match was absolutely beautiful"
7769,2020-12-01 21:54:53,k4v36r,my heart.

7771,2020-12-02 00:10:01,k4v36r,"Jesus my nerves... i Aged considerably throughout this game. Anyway must win victory tonight but lets not celebrate this win is just one step, we need another win against Donezk first and we need some luck for the other game. Let‚Äòs  halt the party we should not forget that we screwed ourselves the last 2 CL campaigns in the last games so caution"
7772,2020-12-01 21:59:28,k4v36r,We have no business being in the last 16 of the CL with how poorly we've played
7773,2020-12-01 22:14:52,k4v36r,"Ha, still not happy tbh, I think with the roster we have we should be way more convincingly. I didn't watch the second half but I understand they got a goal disallowed? JFL"
7774,2020-12-01 22:08:07,k4v36r,"Yep, Gag has improved. He has been solid for 2 games already."
7775,2020-12-01 22:44:27,k4v36r,Enormous game from him and Broz!
7776,2020-12-02 15:11:02,k4v36r,He did more than a solid job last night.
7777,2020-12-02 12:43:47,k4v36r,I was shouting at the screen on why are we getting countered in the 91st minute when all we need to do is defend deep. This is one of the key parts of the game where the team has to show it's mental strengths. This shows to me how fragile this team is.
7778,2020-12-01 22:15:41,k4v36r,Threw a hissy fit like the players on the pitch
7779,2020-12-01 22:21:13,k4v36r,I really don't get it. So many people that don't understand it.
7780,2020-12-01 21:57:16,k4v36r,Hope for no Biscotti here
7781,2020-12-01 21:57:17,k4v36r,If they draw they both go through right? That said we‚Äôre playing at the same time so they won‚Äôt want to risk it and bank on inter winning
7782,2020-12-01 22:22:54,k4v36r,"I'm scared if we are up 4-0 at half and Real-BMB are tied they can agree to something.

Next week can't come soon enough."
7783,2020-12-02 00:01:26,k4v36r,I miss the coke reference - what is that about?
7784,2020-12-01 22:38:45,k4v36r,"It's always the same story, we scream at the Biscotto and then we don't win our own game anyway. Let's beat Shaktar so we don't have more regrets"
7785,2020-12-01 22:16:59,k4v36r,"I dont think so, too much of a risk for Real, if Shaktar even draws, Real is out"
7786,2020-12-01 23:02:41,k4v36r,"Very unlucky with the post, it would have been a great goal. He's really been coming into form the past few games. His dribbling and timing of runs really adds another dimension to our attack."
7787,2020-12-02 01:05:10,k4v36r,"This is the first time Inter has benifit from VAR. The players has been shouting for VARs and get booked for it. Too bad, VAR is prerogative of referee, not implement like tennis through Challenge."
7788,2020-12-01 23:04:18,k4v36r,"Brozo was EPIC ‚Äî that slide tackle in our own box to win the ball at the end would‚Äôve given me a heart attack if it had been almost any other player, but Brozovic was clearly in such perfectly precise control of his movement that I actually felt calm somehow... extraordinary play, and the perfect way to end his overall extraordinary performance right after returning from covid!"
7789,2020-12-01 22:36:40,k4v36r,German fans in general seem really defensive and angry about the result. Its pretty funny tbh

7802,2020-12-02 08:13:21,k4v36r,"I might get downvoted for this, but Galgliardini has been generally fine even last season. It‚Äôs the key open goal misses that didn‚Äôt help his case."
7803,2020-12-02 12:48:10,k4v36r,"It just shows how stupid the players are. Lukaku tried to keep the ball in the corners and was actually smart. Then brozo who is a holding mid came to hit the free kick. Eventually did and tried to work it into the box. Then took a fucking short corner trying to work another shooting chance. He's such an idiot. It should have been, play it short to Rom, let him keep it in the corner,everyone else get in their defensive shape. God so frustrating lol heart attack material team, nothing new"
7804,2020-12-01 22:00:26,k4v36r,"That would be a risk. If we lose and they draw, Real Madrid are out. No biscotto here unless we are winning bug at half and it's still a draw there."
7805,2020-12-01 22:00:22,k4v36r,"Real can't. If they draw and Shaktar wins, they're out"
7806,2020-12-01 21:59:12,k4v36r,If shaktar wins against us Real Madrid gets in UEL by drawing
7807,2020-12-01 21:59:16,k4v36r,"If they draw and we win they both go through n if they draw and we lose, Real Madrid is out. They won't risk it"
7808,2020-12-01 21:59:57,k4v36r,"Nop. If they draw and Shaktar win, Real is out. So Real MUST WIN at least for them, then they'll do us the favor.  

Tie groups plays matches in the same time, so they can assume Shaktar might win against us."
7809,2020-12-01 22:01:10,k4v36r,"They can‚Äôt bank on that, because if Shakhtar gets a point, they‚Äôd go through instead of Real"
7810,2020-12-01 21:59:48,k4v36r,"But, if shaktar draw/win against inter, real madrid will not make it through if RM draw with BM."
7811,2020-12-02 01:00:38,k4v36r,It's a reference to the 1971 match between Monchengaldbach and Inter. Gladbach won but Boninsegna was hit by a Coca-cola can thrown by a fan. Giuseppe Prisco (Inter vice-president and legend) was able to have the game replayed because of this.
7812,2020-12-01 22:22:23,k4v36r,"I'm scared if we are up 4-0 at half and Real-BMB are tied they can agree to something.

You can argue that Thuram was fouled in the build up of the 2nd goal but so was Gladbach‚Äôs first goal too. Their 3rd goal was rightfully rules offside too. Whatever you say, he was offside, that‚Äôs what the rules say."

7818,2020-12-01 22:14:22,k4v36r,didn't Coutinho hit the post 2 times vs Tottenham?
7819,2020-12-01 22:31:31,k4v36r,"As long as we're drawing with Shakhtar, Real will want to win vs Gladbach. Weirdly, it might actually be detrimental to us to score early. Our best bet might actually be Real getting a lead for that reason and then we score relatively late. Or we only score one, keeping them on their toes as Shakhtar could always equalise. 

But obviously we can't and shouldn't make those calculations on the pitch, as it would a huge risk for ourselves. What we really need is for at least one of the other two teams to seriously try to win from start to finish. But I fear that they'd just settle for the draw if we get a good lead early."
7820,2020-12-01 22:33:28,k4v36r,Easiest decision to disallow the goal. I wasn't even sweating it that much.
7821,2020-12-01 22:24:15,k4v36r,"Well I already stopped watching games after Inter-Milan, just had glimpses of CL games but I just think we're an unwatchable misery. It's not about rage, it's about disgust to be honest."

Firstly there is being good looking - talk, fit, even features. I know plenty of heterosexual men who plead a kind of weird blindness here, but it‚Äôs not that difficult. 

However sexiness is a different thing in my mind. Some men are more.... self aware and present in themselves, that‚Äôs the only way I can really put it, and they are conscious that THEY have the power to attract.

Unsexy men have a kind of absence, as if no one is driving.

* **The only game played with no subs** - [January 7, 1951 against the Tri-City Blackhawks](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/195101070TRI.html). The game against the Royals took so long that the Olympians missed their train to Chicago. They chartered a private flight but could only fit six people so they sent a coach and their five starters.

Stevens is a much better coach than Rivers, but a lot of that depends on having people that can play his kind of ball. I think Rondo could work in his system, and while we've had a bunch of top guards, I'll take a backcourt of Rondo and Smart as the starters. Imagine the defense and distribution back there - and then leave the scoring to that scary front-court."

7872,2020-11-30 03:44:51,k3nv6n,"Looks interesting and nice narrative.

One minor quibble is that you have Butler listed on two teams as a starter (and possibly other duplications I didn't notice). I realize it spans a decade, but the principle of a player being on one team at a time to me extends to him being on one All-Star team for the decade. So, with Butler and others who qualify with multiple teams, I'd suggest picking the team the player spent the most time with, or the one where he most clearly showed his qualification to be on the All-Star team."
7873,2020-11-30 04:05:56,k3nv6n,"I thought about that but figured that someone like LeBron James would then be confined to like one team when he had multiple years worthy of being among the best. I can definitely make one where it's players can only be on one team, in which case I'd probably take 2019-20 Jimmy Butler for the Heat seeing as he led his team to the Finals shooting less than 30% from three lmao."

Creed III will be just fine. Not as strong as the first two, but a decent sports drama.

Creed IV will go full cheese and we still hate the Russians, so let's do it again. Or find another country to flex our nationalism on.

Ryan Coogler will return for Creed V, but despite being a great director, won't be able to salvage a poor script and a star such a now massive ego.

Then just give it about 15 years and a 60-year-old Jordan will put the gloves back on for the final film, Adonis Creed.

The bigger question is, who will be the next spin off character after all that? Pretty Ricky Conlon's son? Rocky Jr's son, Logan? I want this series spun-off until the end of time."

How many: *gets humiliated in the first fight then wins the rematch in dramatic fashion storylines* can they milk.  

Creed 2 was strange, you could've replaced both Dragos with a new character and it could've essentially been the same story."
7914,2020-12-29 21:01:00,kmjs5m,"Creed was very good. I hate to shit on movies, but Creed 2 really felt unnecessary & honestly made him a less likable character. If anything we need a Drago movie now. Where he has to fight for him & his pops freedom or something."
7915,2020-12-29 18:47:20,kmjs5m,I don't like Creed (the character). He's unlikable and Michael B Jordan isn't that charismatic. I can only watch these movies for Stallone.

7927,2020-12-29 19:05:50,kmjs5m,"Then it would be ""Drago"", not ""Creed 2"""
7928,2020-12-29 20:58:07,kmjs5m,The emotional logic of Creed 2 is such that Drago Jr should have won that fight.  His character is the one that needs it more.

7935,2020-12-29 20:25:17,kmjs5m,"Creed 2 is closer to Rocky 3.  Is riding high and then a tough, hungry fighter destroys him.  He needs to listen to the right people and continue to learn and diversify, then he comes back and wins.


Creed 2 is way better than Rocky 3.  They handle themes about the weight of expectations much more effectively.  Don't know how you improve on Rocky 4, just because I don't think you could possibly stretch plausibility any further than they did on that one."

7968,2020-12-30 02:50:12,kmce3l,"(Legitimately asking) but that's 90% of TV for the last fifteen years.

How do you watch any TV if a morally dubious main character is the industry standard?"
7969,2020-12-30 21:59:42,kmce3l,What did you expect from the shows? Didn‚Äôt you read up on them before you watched it.
7970,2020-12-31 01:02:46,kmce3l,"I gave them a shot and felt it was not for me. I'm not judging anyone else, mind you, it's a matter of taste.

I love Breaking Bad's and Better Call Saul's antiheroes, those shows come off differently to me."
7971,2020-12-29 10:32:36,km8wdd,"I hope this is MBJ making a guarantor that he can cash in to make Black Leopard, Red Wolf, which he brought the rights too as soon as it dropped."

7974,2020-12-29 15:19:17,km8wdd,"Creed 2 was a gentleman's 7,but Michael B. Jordan is so good in the role its easy to overlook the sequels shortcomings."
7975,2020-12-29 16:17:49,km8wdd,That‚Äôs a good way to get started.
7976,2020-12-29 16:37:58,km8wdd,This is weirdly reverent to Sly‚Äôs creative control of the original Rocky series
7977,2020-12-29 23:38:53,km8wdd,Hopefully he makes the correct creative choice and has the movie begin with Rocky Balboa‚Äôs funeral
7978,2020-12-30 07:09:15,km8wdd,"I'm curious if Black Leopard, Red Wolf is even adaptable as a film. It is vast, and its power is in the written word. It reminded me a lot of Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun works."

7980,2020-12-29 16:20:10,km8wdd,"2 goes very much in the way of the Rocky sequels. I love it, but it gets a lot dumber than the original. The thing I'm worried about is I don't really know where they plan on going from Creed 2. Like Adonis just kind of avenged his fathers death, I'm not sure where you take it from there."
7981,2020-12-29 15:14:43,km8wdd,Where is it that Ryan Coogler has said that he wants to leave movie making? I don't follow the trades as much as I did in the past so i feel little behind/left out.
7982,2020-12-29 16:27:47,km8wdd,Right? 2 didn't have the charm of the 1st but it was still a thrilling watch. You got the Ivan resolution. I don't know where there is left for the sequels for Rocky stuff that would matter to casual fans.
7983,2020-12-29 19:24:01,km8wdd,"I have not heard anything about Coogler recently - outside of his plan to not recast Chadwick for BP2, and that he received a writing credit for Soul. 

I was referring to keeping Michael B. Jordan in movies - and I have also never heard that he has any plans to retire. I simply meant that I think he's probably the most engaging actor to emerge in the last decade and I'd like to see him continue to work. If he wants to also direct, cool. Learn the craft on Creed 3, and take that to something more personal if that's what he wants to do. It will technically be the 9th film in a series that spans 45+ years, they won't let him fail."
7984,2020-12-29 16:32:08,km8wdd,"They've talked about bringing back Clubber Lang and one hand I'm like ""Yeah, of course I want to see Mr. T in a new movie."" He's probably my favorite Rocky villain, but it's a step down and it full brings it into a goofy world where all of Rocky's enemies have protege to fight Creed."
7985,2020-12-29 16:38:35,km8wdd,Go full Rocky III and have him fight a professional wrestler imo
7986,2020-12-29 18:03:30,km8wdd,Feels very much like Street Fighter in that sense. Mr. T is fun but how's he look now?
7987,2020-12-29 18:16:48,km8wdd,he looks alright. He's still in okay shape and I'm sure they're not gonna have him shirtless.
7988,2020-12-29 19:57:14,km8wdd,I've seen him pop up here and there but I didn't even know if he was still acting outside his cameos.
7989,2020-12-29 02:25:58,km4v5f,Master P trying out for the NBA is still a favorite random moment

7993,2020-12-29 02:21:21,km4v5f,I didnt even realize Reebok still existed. Shit I feel old.
7994,2020-12-29 02:22:29,km4v5f,That's impressive.

Would that $2.4B include the copyrights and designs? Or would they only get the name?"
7996,2020-12-29 03:46:47,km4v5f,They are being backed by a new hedgefund. If they get enough investors they can 100% buy Reebok.
7997,2020-12-29 02:53:25,km4v5f,"Shit might as well bring FUBU back.

I don't understand why black culture spends thousands on rich people brands like Gucci, Balenciaga, LV, etc...

They are the culture why not make your own brand and wear it? These kids will wear whatever you wear. Stop making the rich richer. Smh"
7998,2020-12-29 02:40:48,km4v5f,"ReeFUBU. I wonder if they really know what they‚Äôre getting into. They‚Äôre going to need to dump a lot of money into R&D, fly shoe designs, and outbid the big dogs to get prime talent, and get good people with experience to run this thing. It‚Äôs going to take them like a decade too if things even work out. There‚Äôs a reason why there‚Äôs only a few successful basketball shoe companies. And by a few, I mean just Nike. Many have tried and many have failed. Good luck to them though, it would be cool for consumers for Nike to have legit competition."

Hope Romeo gets a chance to play in the NBA one day."
8003,2020-12-29 19:16:54,km4v5f,"That seems very well timed if they do away with the stupid one-and-done NCAA rule. They could officially offer decent money to high schoolers and have them signed as NBA rookies.

Hell, some of these high schoolers have such a ridiculous following on social media that could be worth it without the NBA part."
8004,2020-12-30 00:38:45,km4v5f,The brand will devalue knowing they‚Äôre gonna try and make it more street-style and turn it away from all that cross fit shit. There‚Äôs a big fucking difference between MJs branding power and master p
8005,2020-12-29 02:52:50,km4v5f,Woooooooo! Now a handful of black people will own this company and profit from it. That will for sure improve the life of the average black person
8006,2020-12-29 02:33:14,km4v5f,How does Master P still have money? What does he do these days?
8007,2020-12-29 02:50:28,km4v5f,"What‚Äôs wild is he almost made the league, was last man cut. If they had a G league back then he would have been in it!"

8009,2020-12-29 06:16:00,km4v5f,I remember seeing him play pre-season games in Toronto. He actually was pretty decent. Had a solid ‚Äòold man‚Äô game.

8011,2020-12-29 05:13:23,km4v5f,I think I remember an episode of MTV Cribs and his shot was pure. He couldn‚Äôt miss!
8012,2020-12-29 03:37:53,km4v5f,Master P does not have money to buy the team. Must have some deep pocketed dudes backing them or leveraged buy out..
8013,2020-12-29 14:56:56,km4v5f,Saw lil Romeo play in a high school game back in the day too.  He was alright.
8014,2020-12-29 02:29:38,km4v5f,"As a white boy with no hops, I really used to hope the pumps would help. They didnt. Id try 3 pumps, 10 pumps, and got nothing...and thats also what she said."
8015,2020-12-29 15:40:14,km4v5f,"Reebok has been coming back for awhile. Ever since they stopped focusing only on MMA and Crossfit. The newer stuff is pretty nice, basically Adidas but not just black and white."
8016,2020-12-29 02:28:27,km4v5f,"No but most people don‚Äôt. What he can do is form an ownership collective/group with other artists and musicians who can pool together enough equity in order to borrow an amount for purchasing control and ownership of the brand. A board of owners would form and they‚Äôd rebrand it a more modern progressive artist friendly, black owner brand. 

I think it‚Äôs a great business plan and opportunity for him and anyone else involved.



For the record, I have no clue what I‚Äôm talking about haha."
8017,2020-12-29 02:26:53,km4v5f,I guess they are going to get some investors?
8018,2020-12-29 02:27:25,km4v5f,"Says his net worth is 200 mill so he shouldnt have issues as long as he has other investors, which it says he does."
8019,2020-12-29 03:34:40,km4v5f,Wouldn‚Äôt have had a chance to buy it in the 90s though
8020,2020-12-29 02:22:46,km4v5f,"It‚Äôs a part of Adidas now. I remember when it was a direct competitor of Nike and Adidas in the early 2000s though, shit now I feel old too."
8021,2020-12-29 02:39:31,km4v5f,"In terms of basketball they almost basically only release retro versions of their famous shoes like the Iverson‚Äôs shoes. 

But now they are very big in MMA, CrossFit, Fitness clothes,etc. They have a major deal with UFC which I would guess is a big reason why the damn asking price is 2.4 billions."
8022,2020-12-29 02:42:56,km4v5f,They changed their focus to cross training and MMA. Adidas isn't going to sell you a product that hurts their main product so they removed reebok from a lot of sports markets.
8023,2020-12-29 02:47:17,km4v5f,It better include the design for the question retros. Only thing worth a damn.
8024,2020-12-29 03:41:15,km4v5f,"You are underestimating how much work it is to start and scale an apparel company. BBB struggled to send shoes to customers in a timely fashion, or to put it another way BBB struggled to make and send the product to their customers. Take a step back and think about what that means, even if Lonzo had been a star, and hundred of thousands of people wanted to buy BBB branded gear and products, the company would have been unable to make enough products in a timely fashion, and as a result and they would have lost ton of revenue due to operational issues.

If Master P, and Baron Davis, buy reebok they will get copyrights, designs, and brand equity, but that undersells the rest of what they are buying. If they buy Reebok, they will   
 obtain access to a supply chain that can make shoes and apparel in a timely fashion, they will have access to distributors who can efficiently distribute their products, they will have access to back office functions that can track and manage their inventory, and other working capital to efficiently manage their operations, they will have a high quality functional website, and a ton of other stuff that are easy to forget about, but are really important when are you attempting to run a  multi-billion dollar apparel company."
8025,2020-12-29 02:45:35,km4v5f,Everything

8028,2020-12-29 04:53:32,km4v5f,"Because they don‚Äôt care about the designs or who owns it, their main objective is to flaunt the price tags.

8032,2020-12-29 16:09:34,km4v5f,Reebok can 100% do well. Freaking *NEW BALANCE* signed the quietest star in recent memory in Kawhi Leonard and is doing well. I think they just signed Jamal Murray also. I‚Äôm sure someone would be willing to bail on Adidas / Nike for a signature shoe. Puma has a nice crop of NBA players also iirc.

8042,2020-12-29 03:26:22,km4v5f," Reading and learning about his start and how he built his fortune, make it fairly easy to believe his investors will have faith in his business plan. 

That being said, does Reebok brand recognition carry the weight it did in, say, 1990? ..or are they gonna rebrand the whole shit and push the black owned, black designed, black sold theme? I would think it could blow up if they push that plot and sponsor some currently relevant pop culturally significant spokesmen."
8043,2020-12-29 03:32:36,km4v5f,He probably doesn't even have a 1/10th of that right now. This is on the same level as A.Rod trying to buy the Mets talk. The people with real money will step in an buy it after Master P runs his mouth some. It will probably be bought by a major clothing conglomerate.

8045,2020-12-29 02:23:53,km4v5f,I had some of the pumps back in the day. They used to make decent shoes but just couldnt keep up with Nike.

8053,2020-12-29 05:02:21,km4v5f,Kind of sad considering most rappers come from poverty. Just shows you they don't know how to spend their money the smart way. Look at a guy like J Cole he wears bummy shit everyday and doesn't wear jewelry. I guarantee you he has more money than any of those big name rappers who continuously spend their money on diamonds and high end fashion brands.

8061,2020-12-29 09:32:47,km4v5f,"Idk if you know but Reebok is the main sponsor of UFC right now. But I guess the best market for sport companies is NBA since basketball shoes sell really well. Like football (european) has 10x the popularity of NBA but their shoes deals are like 20 or 30 million for even the biggest stars meanwhile you have NBA rookies getting 100 million deals. Because everybody can wear NBA kicks, it would be weird seeing your grandpa going to the market in football shoes with cleats haha."
8062,2020-12-29 05:03:59,km4v5f,"Not right now but things come and go in cycles. Last 5 years were nothing but yeezys and nmd's but now puma is making a comeback, new balance signed kawhi, and now reebok might be getting bought and refreshed/rebranded. More big shoe brands= more opportunities for players to get sponsorships and singature shoes. Thats good for players. Plus, more competition is always better for the consumer. Maybe nike and adidas step their game up with this news"

8070,2020-12-29 07:26:57,km4v5f,"Sad, yes, but there's context behind it in a way.  There's an undercurrent of ""fuck the system.""  Probably not by individuals, but on a cultural scale.  Like telling society, ""we're not expected to have money or success, but fuck you, i made it, i'll be as gaudy as i want"" sort of thing.  

Some of it has definitely been coopted as just an image to help make more money, but for a large number of us, that grew up thinking the only ways to thrive were hoops, rapping, or drugs, there's a sense of satisfaction in saying we've got money and we're going to use it in ways society doesn't approve of, even if it's to our own long term detriment, because for many of us, there is no long-term."
8071,2020-12-29 05:18:52,km4v5f,He‚Äôs a rare breed. Even Kanye was smart enough to capitalize on it by designing the most plain and basic shit yet he slaps a $300+ price tag on his items and hip hop culture eats it up.
8072,2020-12-29 04:36:29,km4v5f,He was in his early 30s at that point and had dropped out before he ever played college ball. Sure he could play but it was all PR.

8082,2020-12-29 02:42:30,km4v5f,"And if you were poor, youd get generics at Payless and hoped nobody at school could tell the difference. Same wirh the off brand Jordan wannabes that had a jumpman but backwards or upside down."
8083,2020-12-29 06:32:48,km4v5f,Kanye is a brilliant marketer. Everything is a stunt for publicity. He teamed up with Kim to perfect his art. He could probably sell a blank CD and make a few million.
8084,2020-12-29 06:34:30,km4v5f,So you're saying he could play
8085,2020-12-29 04:05:17,km4v5f,LOL all rappers are showy... 50 cent claimed he made 300mln in the vitamin water deal in reality he got 10% of that in the sale..
8086,2020-12-29 16:26:46,km4v5f,"I can‚Äôt go 2 months without my mom saying ‚ÄúRemember those hideous Shaqnosis shoes you had? Hahaha.‚Äù

Like, I get it Mom, but I was 12."
8087,2020-12-29 03:38:46,km4v5f,"Kemp before alcoholism/drugs was crazy. Closest thing to him now is probably Bam, although Bam is nowhere near as explosive but is a better passer. What‚Äôs crazy is Fat Kemp still put up 18/10 regularly with the Cavs."
8088,2020-12-29 07:33:15,km4v5f,Just saying I'm sure he killed it on mtv rock n jock
8089,2020-12-29 03:55:43,km4v5f,I would say zions ceiling is Shawn Kemp. Hopefully he reaches his potential.
8090,2020-12-30 16:22:42,km4v5f,Hell yeah
8091,2020-12-29 03:58:10,km4v5f,I thought about him as a potential comparison but him being undersized with a shorter wingspan makes me think of him as more Larry Johnson before the injuries or Prime Barkley.
8092,2020-12-29 00:07:45,km1r9y,"Interesting news!

Has there ever been a franchise before where the two main leads have both separately directed installments? Don't really know what it means creatively, but an interesting decision nonetheless."
8093,2020-12-29 00:05:41,km1r9y,"As long as the story is written by Stallone I think it'll be good. He knows these characters better than anyone.

I'm a little nervous about whether Jordan has any filmmaking experience at all though. Even though Steven Caple Jr.'s previous film before Crews II was a huge bomb it still had good reviews and the guy still had experience. Jordan has been an executive producer in Raising Dion and that's about it. Great actors don't always translate into great directors. Especially when Jordan is going to be directing himself to get punched in the face. This isn't a Gran Torino/Expendables thing where the director can just step in from off set and start acting. I'm trying to picture MBJ covered in sweat, makeup, stitches, prosthetics, boxing gloves and a mouthguard trying to give Tessa Thompson her prompt. Does he just keep the cameras rolling?"
8094,2020-12-29 02:31:00,km1r9y,Honestly Creed 2 felt like a really solid ending for the entire franchise.
8095,2020-12-29 03:26:59,km1r9y,[deleted]
8096,2020-12-29 01:41:43,km1r9y,"That reminds me, still haven't seen Creed 2"
8097,2020-12-29 00:22:34,km1r9y,Interesting. He's got a lot of acting talent. I wonder how much of that will translate to directing talent. I'm quite keen to see how this turns out.
8098,2020-12-29 00:42:44,km1r9y,I couldn‚Äôt be rooting for him to succeed more
8099,2020-12-29 08:14:25,km1r9y,"I am calling this now, to finish the trilogy, they will take it all the way back to the beginning. There will be huge emphasis on the Jordan/Thompson's relationship in the story and Creed will have 1 final match but he will lose going the distance (Rocky 1). He will be able to come to terms though unlike his father and retire, so he can grow old with his family.

(Next part I'm not as confident in predicting  but would enjoy) The fighter he looses to will be Clubbers nephew. Clubber Lang will have changed though finding his faith (like the real Mr T), and will impart wisdom to Creed showing him he doesnt have to fight to live his life."
8100,2020-12-29 04:37:13,km1r9y,Jordan is dedicated to his craft. I imagine this movie will be worth seeing.
8101,2020-12-29 08:32:30,km1r9y,Does Clubber Lang have a kid?
8102,2020-12-29 03:09:36,km1r9y,Forgot there was a Creed II.  Must be doing ok if doing a sequel.
8103,2020-12-29 05:07:28,km1r9y,üôÑ
8104,2020-12-29 05:41:29,km1r9y,MBJ is going to fight Clubber Lang's son now
8105,2020-12-29 02:54:52,km1r9y,I'm fine with this!
8106,2020-12-29 05:08:04,km1r9y,There was a Creed 2... ayayay
8107,2020-12-29 06:37:53,km1r9y,"Huh. Has Michael B. Jordan directed anything before, feature film or otherwise?"
8108,2020-12-29 12:38:05,km1r9y,"I‚Äôm not against actors directing. I just hope that when they do they‚Äôve done enough training to really hone their own style. 

Dude is talented as an actor so I can‚Äôt wait to see how he lays out his own vision."
8109,2020-12-29 13:40:43,km1r9y,Am I the only one who read this as Creep 3 and got super excited?
8110,2020-12-29 14:46:35,km1r9y,"Oh look another actor turned ‚Äúdirector‚Äù, looking at you Bruce Dallas Howard."
8111,2020-12-29 15:39:49,km1r9y,Creed 3: With Arms Wide Open
8112,2020-12-29 17:23:35,km1r9y,But will Rocky be in it or even mentioned.
8113,2020-12-30 01:51:01,km1r9y,Well good luck MBJ
8114,2020-12-29 06:36:46,km1r9y,eh....why not
8115,2020-12-29 10:23:16,km1r9y,Mickeal b Jordan is a very good actor I trust him in this position
8116,2020-12-29 06:04:13,km1r9y,"Michael B Jordan is my favorite actor of my generation right now. Hell, I even have a celebrity crush on the guy. This news is thrilling to me."
8117,2020-12-29 02:39:48,km1r9y,"Star Trek, Shatner and Nimoy both directed films in the franchise."
8118,2020-12-29 14:42:48,km1r9y,Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates) Directed Psycho 3.
8119,2020-12-29 00:33:59,km1r9y,"I'm not sure how well he'll do, but I'm looking forward to seeing how well he does."
8120,2020-12-29 01:21:35,km1r9y,"Does Sly know Adonis? 

If Rocky (or Drago) isn‚Äôt a key character, the only character that is a Stallone creation is Mary Anne Creed, and she wasn‚Äôt developed in the original films. 

Creed was a rehash of Rocky, and Creed 2 was a rehash of Rocky III. I fully expect Creed 3 will find Donny having brain damage, out of money, with Floyd Mayweather trying to get him to fight his up and coming fighter."
8121,2020-12-29 17:19:06,km1r9y,"Considering the history of the Rocky franchise (and how it started with Stallone walking into Hollywood with a script, demanding to direct his first film), I doubt Stallone would let Jordan fail at this."
8122,2020-12-29 04:08:29,km1r9y,"I mean, I know this is an extreme example, but if memory serves Mel Gibson's first directing gig was Braveheart. 

And fortunately, in a lot of cases, filmmaking is a team sport so if he puts together the right production crew he will atleast make something watchable."
8123,2020-12-29 00:30:40,km1r9y,"Actors live on set, they pick up a lot and most actors turned Directors are generally better than the average director."
8124,2020-12-30 01:56:45,km1r9y,Creed 2 was a bomb ?
8125,2020-12-29 03:32:18,km1r9y,I‚Äôve heard that Stallone ‚Äúwrites‚Äù a lot of his scripts like pop stars ‚Äúwrite‚Äù a lot of their hits...
8126,2020-12-29 10:39:49,km1r9y,"I hope Stallone doesn't write it. He didn't write Creed and that was great, while he did write Creed 2 and that was much worse. I know it's his franchise but the Creed movies would be much better if they were by Coogler, as in the end he created Adonis and he's the main character."
8127,2020-12-29 05:54:28,km1r9y,Actors learn a surprising amount just from working with directors. He‚Äôll know what he‚Äôs doing and I bet it‚Äôs gonna be great. Also he will have an AD by his side helping.
8128,2020-12-29 06:17:48,km1r9y,"Yeah, Creed 2 felt like a good ending. I‚Äôm down for more Creed but hesitant."
8129,2020-12-29 13:24:20,km1r9y,Clubbed Lang‚Äôs son Clubber Bang wants redemption!!!!
8130,2020-12-29 04:01:50,km1r9y,"Naw, he's gonna fight Jake Paul."
8131,2020-12-29 11:59:38,km1r9y,"Why doesn‚Äôt he just fight Milo Ventimiglia? 

Plot twist: The son of Rocky has been secretly training to fight the son of Apollo Creed."
8132,2020-12-29 15:19:35,km1r9y,It‚Äôs pretty good! I think it‚Äôs an appropriate sequel!
8133,2020-12-29 12:51:23,km1r9y,Same
8134,2020-12-29 14:04:55,km1r9y,"Not as good as the first, just to warn ya"
8135,2020-12-29 06:19:30,km1r9y,"I started rooting for Drago's son in Creed II

I'm skipping this movie, Adonis is a MS compared to Rocky"
8136,2020-12-30 15:59:55,km1r9y,"Yep, both Creed movies made over 4 times their budget"
8137,2020-12-29 17:46:36,km1r9y,"Well yeah, Bryce Dallas Howard is a third-generation actress/director. Her grandfather Rance Howard was also an actor/director. One of her kids will probably continue the family curse of becoming an actor and a director. Those poor, talented, money-making bastards."
8138,2020-12-29 04:25:08,km1r9y,"First Contact was directed by Frakes, so that's three. Though Frakes was never a main with the same cast as Shatner and Nimoy."
8139,2020-12-29 03:50:41,km1r9y,Yeah I am curious too.
8140,2020-12-29 11:40:36,km1r9y,One might see this as a real life under dog rising above his assumed station. I hope he fucking NAILS it. What a gifted actor he is. Can‚Äôt wait to see what he does!
8141,2020-12-29 17:09:19,km1r9y,"It was his second film after *The Man Without a Face*. But you're right, with the right support a first time filmmaker can be really successful even without experience. Bradley Cooper comes to mind recently."
8142,2020-12-29 00:46:54,km1r9y,Most actors who turn to directing make really bad movies. Even the best actors can‚Äôt do it. Being a director is a totally different skill set.
8143,2020-12-30 15:59:11,km1r9y,"No, it wasn't

Itade over 4 times its budget iirc"
8144,2020-12-29 06:18:14,km1r9y,He definitely wrote Rocky 1 all by himself
8145,2020-12-29 06:43:15,km1r9y,"Stallone definitely names his own characters, only he would name people shit like Hale Caesar, Tommy 'Machine' Gunn, and Thunderlips."
8146,2020-12-29 14:21:31,km1r9y,"He didn't write Creed but [he wrote every scene and line of dialogue that his character was in.](https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495651/how-sylvester-stallone-changed-creed-i-and-ii-to-make-it-more-comfortable) I would say that the best parts of Creed were the interaction between Rocky and Adonis so that puts us on good footing. The issue that Stallone has is originality in his writing. His dialogue and characters are usually on point.

Also fun (or not so fun) fact, Stallone doesn't actually own any rights to the Rocky franchise. He's only there because they want him to be."
8147,2020-12-29 13:49:11,km1r9y,Apollo Creed created Adonis
8148,2020-12-30 16:13:03,km1r9y,Fair. I mean they still pump out Hallmark movies so there's obviously a market for a lot of stuff.  I say that being an avid consumer of straight to video horror flicks.
8149,2020-12-29 06:35:50,km1r9y,Still absolutely counts. That put Star Trek leagues ahead of everyone else in this game
8150,2020-12-29 01:51:10,km1r9y,"Jon Favreau, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Zach Braff come of the top of my head as good directors who started their careers acting. Bryce has only recently started directing but her work with her 2 Mandalorian episodes is fantastic."
8151,2020-12-29 03:10:34,km1r9y,That new George Clooney one is a bomb.
8152,2020-12-29 01:03:12,km1r9y,Mel Gibson and Ben Affleck are two off of the top of my head who won Academy Awards for directing. Joseph Gordon Levitt is a fantastic director. I can think of more great actors turned director than I can think of the opposite.
8153,2020-12-29 08:36:10,km1r9y,This comment is really off the mark
8154,2020-12-29 18:15:32,km1r9y,"Angelina Jolie comes to mind. Terrible director, as far as her acting chops...    meh"
8155,2020-12-29 00:47:46,km1r9y,Name three.
8156,2020-12-29 16:53:18,km1r9y,"Yeah, I should have qualified this. No doubt he wrote Rocky and some of his other earlier films but as he settled into the 80s I heard he pushed his way onto more scripts than actually contributed."
8157,2020-12-29 15:10:13,km1r9y,"> Hale Caesar, Tommy 'Machine' Gunn, and Thunderlips

Those names aren't even that out there when it comes to boxing. Not when Shannon 'The Cannon' Briggs, Owen 'What the Heck' Beck, Michael 'Second To' Nunn, Juan 'The Hispanic Causing Panic' Lazcano, Dick Tiger, Slapsie Maxie, Sweet Pea, 'Boom Boom' Mancini, Jimmy 'The Jew Killer' Mclarnin, Hector 'Macho' Comacho, Homicide Hank, and Manny 'The Mexicutioner' Pacqiao exist."
8158,2020-12-29 03:11:44,km1r9y,Olivia Wilde did a good debut.   Haven't seen Jonah Hills 90s Kids yet want to see.
8159,2020-12-29 09:57:01,km1r9y,"In Bryce‚Äôs case, it helps when your father is already an acclaimed director."
8160,2020-12-29 02:54:21,km1r9y,"TV directing and movie directing are very different. In TV, the showrunner/producers handle a lot of stuff that a movie director would do."
8161,2020-12-29 13:01:46,km1r9y,"Not to mention Ron Howard and Rob Reiner, who are arguably known more for their directing than their one time sitcom gigs (yes I know they both did more acting than that)"
8162,2020-12-29 04:40:13,km1r9y,It‚Äôs a Netflix film with a meaningless limited theatrical release. And it‚Äôs quite well made.
8163,2020-12-29 02:36:26,km1r9y,Affleck does not have an Academy Award for directing.
8164,2020-12-29 00:58:45,km1r9y,"Kevin Spacey, Laurence Fishburne, Eddie Murphy, Andy Garcia, William Shatner, Dan Aykroyd, Kevin Bacon, Marlon Brando, Anthony Hopkins, Johnny Depp, Nicholas Cage.

Great actors, shitty directors.

Directing a movie requires different sets of skill than acting in a movie.

Some can do both very well (Clint Eastwood, Ron Howard, Mel Gibson, George Clooney, Kevin Costner), many cannot."
8165,2020-12-29 01:00:39,km1r9y,"Edward Norton - Motherless Brooklyn = Mess.    

Joseph Gordon Levitt - Don Jon = Mess.    

Ryan Gosling - Lost River = Awful.    

John Turturro - The Jesus Rolls = AWFUL!!!     

And then you‚Äôve got Jack Nicholson, Johnny Depp, Jodie Foster, Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Michael Keaton and plenty more great actors who have directed some absolutely abysmal movies."
8166,2020-12-29 13:33:55,km1r9y,"Lol, who is an actor turned director himself."
8167,2020-12-29 02:48:31,km1r9y,"My bad, I thought Argo won him a directing Oscar but he got Best Picture for it. So still fucking solid, but not what I thought and said initially."
8168,2020-12-29 04:41:17,km1r9y,I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs emotionally ok about it because of his other two Oscars.
8169,2020-12-29 03:35:53,km1r9y,Does not mean shit
8170,2020-12-29 02:45:36,km1r9y,Pretty sure he got one for Fargo
8171,2020-12-29 01:05:03,km1r9y,"Shatner and Garcia were just fine directors but the rest of that list, yeah. 

Actors turned directors like Woody Allen, John Cassavettes, Ron Howard, Penny Marshall, Ben Affleck, George Clooney, Clint Eastwood, Peter Berg, Rob Reiner, Mel Gibson, Mel Brooks, Jodie Foster, Robert Redford, Jon Favreau(who saved Star Wars!!!!), Sean Penn, Orson Wells, Sarah Polley and Tom McCathy have all directed acclaimed movies. 

So I disagree."
8172,2020-12-29 03:38:50,km1r9y,Don Jon is pretty cool
8173,2020-12-29 02:50:24,km1r9y,i thought Don Jon and Lost River were both exceptional.
8174,2020-12-29 01:04:05,km1r9y,Don Jon is a solid movie. üëå
8175,2020-12-29 03:13:20,km1r9y,I enjoyed Motherless Brooklyn. I actually thought the directing was really good.
8176,2020-12-29 02:53:03,km1r9y,"Do you mean Argo? It won best picture, but he wasn't even nominated for best director."
8177,2020-12-29 02:18:09,km1r9y,"I wish Sarah Polley directed more.  Away From Her was the last movie that had me tears, movies rarely make me cry.   Then who makes their third feature film a documentary about her own immediate family history? Sarah Polley does.  And it works so well! And its not like anything you've ever seen: Stories We Tell."
8178,2020-12-29 02:05:00,km1r9y,Is it really accurate to call Welles an actor turned director? I think he had always done both.
8179,2020-12-29 02:54:36,km1r9y,"This is a fine list because it has enough good examples to matter, but just going to point out that several of these names were also middling actors or directors, so it's not a completely genuine set of examples. Just taking a cursory glance, Clooney, Foster, and Penn have indeed all directed several films, but... I'd hesitate to call any of them really good. Maybe a few above average films sprinkled in there at best.

I suppose it really comes down to what the original question was, whether it's not making ""really bad"" movies or ""good"" movies."

It was hard not to compare myself to them but I realized that I need to do what works for me if I want to succeed here. I still study aloy, use OH, and do extra practice because that‚Äôs what works for me personally. Even though some of my friends think I‚Äôm crazy for doing that much work I don‚Äôt care because that‚Äôs what works for me.

Try not to compare yourself to others and find what method, time management, and study techniques work for you to help you succeed at UCSD. Hope this helps, dm me if you want to ask anything!"
8209,2020-12-27 01:48:18,kkskmi,"Question: how do you *really* know ""Michelle"" got an A in the class? Aced every quiz? Never studied? Did she pull up her academic history and show you? Livestream her homework process?  

People's grades are like their instagram stories: they can make it look however they want if you aren't viewing the real thing. So don't buy what people are fronting (and many are). Toss that aside.

Focus on the process of learning, the improved understanding of how the universe works, the cool story of how what you are studying was unearthed--it was someone's excited discovery, once. Be curious about why you are studying what you are studying (somebody thought it was relevant--find out why). Once you start to enjoy the idea that you are learning all sorts of cool stuff, the grades will sort themselves out, will be what they will be, and you'll be more at peace with them.

You are paying money for knowledge, not a letter in the alphabet."
8210,2020-12-27 00:13:14,kkskmi,"Everyone has something that they are great at and some other things that they don‚Äôt do so well. Maybe you don‚Äôt know ‚ÄúMichelle‚Äù enough to know that there are something you are great at but she‚Äôs not. In the end those things balance out and most of us are not so far from each other in terms of our abilities, holistically speaking."
8211,2020-12-27 00:01:01,kkskmi,Maybe she already knew calculus. Some people are just ahead. Maybe she studied in a more effective way than you did. Maybe she skipped class to study on her own. Maybe she really was just lazy and aced the class anyways. Who cares. You passed with a good grade and you did what you had to learn and ingrain that information into your brain. Why do you care about what others do? What do you gain from that
8212,2020-12-27 08:29:22,kkskmi,"I was one of those kids. In both Math 11 and BIPN 148, I showed up at exactly one discussion, missed class at least five times.

I pulled a 99.25% in BIPN 148, and something a little lower in Math 11.

How did I pull it off? Prior knowledge and enthusiasm. I'm not a god.

I'm also the kid that studied his ass off for OCHEM, and got a B+. Our strengths are different, don't sweat it. I needed a lotta help in OCHEM, and I asked. Wasn't ashamed of asking, nor was I shy to participate in discussion.

You are not inferior :)"
8213,2020-12-27 08:55:08,kkskmi,Why would you not? Competition is what motivates me to study more and do better in school and life in general. I would be lazy fuck otherwise
8214,2020-12-27 04:45:56,kkskmi,"Comparing yourself to others is not essentially bad. You can learn a lot from others' work ethic, modes of thinking, ability to communicate, etc. But comparing grades is often counterproductive, and always pointless."
8215,2020-12-27 19:20:39,kkskmi,"There are a lot of factors that go into determining a grade for a person. How they were raised (maybe they did a lot of math as a kid), what classes they've taken, what experience they have, the resources they used to study for that class, the friends they consulted, the techniques they used, how they felt on test days (anxiety can significantly lower performance), the way the test is formulated, the way the test is graded, how the class is weighted etc. 

There are simply too many factors at play here for you to see someone get a better grade than you in one class and conclude anything except maybe that they have a better mastery of Math 20B. Even that is suspect, depending on how you performed relative to your mastery. Many people hate timed and closed notes tests because of the anxiety they cause and their inapplicability to real-world scenarios. 

The point is that you're comparing a result that is determined by a great number of factors. I bet you're drawing some insanely narrow conclusion like ""Michelle must be smarter than me"" or ""Michelle must be more talented than me"". 

There isn't even a general definition of intelligence that can be scientifically agreed upon. I'm sure you're familiar with the ""judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree"" quote. Even if ""Michelle"" got better grades than you in every single class you took together for 4 years, that would still only be weak evidence to suggest that ""Michelle"" is better than you at academics and even weaker evidence to suggest that ""Michelle"" is more intelligent. 

For what it's worth, I'm a bit of a Michelle. I got a 3.8 GPA in CS while graduating early and hardly studying. I slept through or skipped almost all my lectures and just read slide decks the night before tests. That's because I've been learning CS since I was 7. I started coding when I was 12. My parents went to every length imaginable to give me an academic advantage and I used it to do as little work as possible in college. I had a roommate who has an S-tier work ethic and I took as many classes with him as I could. If I wanted to feel superior to someone like you, I could easily omit all that information. And guess what? That precious academic advantage I had means jack shit in the workforce. You're not dealing with closed box problems that have given solutions. There is no slide deck to scan. There is no test. It's real work, real problems and a good work ethic is infinitely more useful than the ability to absorb and dump information. 

Anyway this is already way too long so I'll stop ranting now. Hopefully this helped."
8216,2020-12-27 01:13:43,kkskmi,It takes time to change that mindset so please be patient with yourself- the most important part is to recognize that comparing yourself to others isn‚Äôt really good for you. The brain is malleable but just as stubborn. Reward yourself for doing things well and be content with what you receive if you have done all you can.
8217,2020-12-27 04:24:42,kkskmi,"How I think about it is: We all come in with different goals, more or fewer resources, and just different circumstances in general, so any comparison with oneself to another is just invalid. Shifting mindsets will certainly take a little while, but hopefully whatever logic you use will eventually get internalized..."
8218,2020-12-28 20:38:14,kkskmi,"Different people come from different backgrounds. Some people have more preparation with certain subjects (like math) than others. So if you are worried about your performance in the class relative to Michelle‚Äôs being an indicator of innate ability, it is worth knowing that grades are not a great metric of innate ability, _and_ for most purposes, innate ability is less important than work ethic.

Regardless, the goal should be to be better than _yourself_. This is the issue with extrinsic motivation (things such as money, wanting to be better than others, etc.) I‚Äôm not claiming that you have such extrinsic motivations. I‚Äôm just saying that such motivations lead to a very results-oriented thinking that can then lead to being incapacitated by seeing others outperform you or obtain better results. It is far easier to continue onwards by finding fulfillment in doing things for their own sake, and personal enrichment. This comes from understanding that different people have different backgrounds, but that this doesn‚Äôt have any bearing on what your capacity to perform is, and that the subject you study is a distinct and potentially beautiful entity, independent of the _class_ in which you study it."
8219,2020-12-27 01:12:20,kkskmi,"Everything you‚Äôre saying logically makes sense. No good comes out of this comparison, only harm, but it‚Äôs so hard to stop comparing myself.

For something else, I could say ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no point in hitting myself with a spray bottle,‚Äù and I could easily stop doing it. I don‚Äôt have an innate desire to do that though. With comparing yourself to others, whether it‚Äôs from immaturity, human nature, or whatever, I just can‚Äôt help it."
8220,2020-12-25 05:02:10,kjqwe9,Early Gen Z culture was in full swing by 2016. That‚Äôs the year most of Gen Z glorifies as well for some odd reason.
8221,2020-12-25 06:18:24,kjqwe9,Man I‚Äôm starting to think 2000 is a weird year to be born in.
8222,2020-12-25 08:47:54,kjqwe9,"I mean you know I disagree with 2000s babies being Millennials, but otherwise this is nice analysis"
8223,2020-12-26 06:34:51,kjqwe9,2000 should also be grouped with those born in the late 90s. We grew up with pretty much the same thing!! We grew up in the mid 00s too!
8224,2020-12-25 05:26:25,kjqwe9,"Even in late 2015, the atmosphere during my senior year felt... different compared to my previous years of high school. Idk how else to describe it."
8225,2020-12-25 06:18:43,kjqwe9,I agree with this somewhat
8226,2020-12-25 06:21:03,kjqwe9,"To be honest, it is, but it's weirder to be born in 2002, where you were born post-9/11 but pre-Homeland security/Iraq War, 2000's kid, graduating in the midst of the pandemic. But your birth year is pretty weird. You guys are still disputed to this day on either being the youngest 20th century babies or the oldest 21st century babies."
8227,2020-12-25 08:56:38,kjqwe9,Thanks.
8228,2020-12-26 10:25:55,kjqwe9,I did but I also think they could be grouped with 2001-2003 as well.
8229,2020-12-25 07:11:42,kjqwe9,"I know what you are saying, I was in college snd there was a kinda dark feeling. Like music was edgier and politics were so controversial. It felt different."
8230,2020-12-25 07:16:43,kjqwe9,How is it weird ? Despite being born pre homeland security you guys were born within that era. The 9/11 era. You don‚Äôt remember a world without it as you were newborns. Mid to late 90‚Äôs were barely alive as we were children. You guys weren‚Äôt born when the Afghan war started and were only 0-1 years old in March 2003 when the Iraq war started. This should not be weird to 2002 babies. Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt remember any of it.
8231,2020-12-26 15:42:17,kjqwe9,We're grouped with 1997-1999 as well as 2001-2002.
8232,2020-12-25 07:25:05,kjqwe9,"Here is the infamous LilyAndrews1997. I bet you don't remember any of the 90's or the pop cultural stuff from the early 00's like all of the boy bands and stuff so I don't know why you are talking. 

DUH! Obviously we don't remember it but the fact that we were alive prior to it is good enough. I know you feel some type of way when people end Millennials in 1996 based on 9/11 memory as you always claim memory of 9/11 but you guys were only 4 so even you guys do remember it, it wouldn't be clear memory of 9/11."
8233,2020-12-27 04:51:09,kjqwe9,"Okay, AND?"
8234,2020-12-25 07:35:22,kjqwe9,"Idc about remembering the 90‚Äôs lol you‚Äôre projecting your personal feelings onto me snd its showing haha. And of course I remember the pop culture of the early 2000‚Äôs like boy bands and stuff (most people my age remember it) I was 3-5 years old when they were a huge phenomenon. I wasn‚Äôt a newborn in 2000-2002 when they were big which is what you are arguing for the period of 2002-2003 in regards to people your age. I remember Britney, Christina, Eminem, Outkast, Alicia Keys, Destiny‚Äôs child, etc. I mean I was a kid. That was my childhood era. It seems you make up these false scenarios to separate yourself from 2003 babies which is why I called you out. 

Also you cannot really tell people how clear or vague their memories are especially at age 4 when the hippocampus is already developed. I was also 2 and a half months away from turning 5 on 9/11 and if you knew anything about that time you‚Äôd know that coverage was shown for months on end from 2001 to 2002.I‚Äôm not sure what this has to do with you feeling weird about being a newborn when homeland security was a thing. You are the literal definition of a homelander. You are trying to find ways to make me angry by being a dictator because you are mad."
8235,2020-12-25 07:50:25,kjqwe9,"Who's mad? Not me. You are just trying to appear older than everybody else and invalidate everyone else's experience when you are only 23. You say you remember pop culture of the early 00s but when I say that I remember entertainment of the mid 00s, you will gatekeep me of my own memory but defending your own. You're a hypocrite bro. And for your information, I am NOT the literal definiton of a Homelander. The definition of a Homelander is someone born AFTER the establishment of Homeland security, not someone who couldn't remember a time before. That's subjective as heck. 2003+ is the literal definition of a Homelander. You love to tell other people their experiences so I don't even wanna hear that crap. Goodbye. Merry Christmas and God bless."
8236,2020-12-25 08:31:49,kjqwe9,"Lmao you are upset. How am I trying to appear older by listing my actual experiences as someone born in the 90‚Äôs. I feel like you think I have a superiority complex and I don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt invalidate anyones experiences I call things out for what they are. And you did not experience a world pre homeland security lol. 

Also I have never gatekept you from the mid 2000‚Äôs, I was also 3-6 from 2000-2003 and in elementary school in that time you were 3-4 in the mid 2000‚Äôs. If anyone has argued with me on here Im sure they know I give credit where its due. You were born during the establishment of homeland security you are a homelander, you were literally like 3 months old. You do not remember anything before it nor where you born before TSA establishment. You were a baby in that time. Hell people born in the mid 90‚Äôs are homelanders damn near as they were kids when it was billed."
8237,2020-12-25 08:58:04,kjqwe9,"No man. You are the one with a superiority complex, looking back on the history of your posts. I'm not a Homelander if I was already alive before the Homeland security act was even established. Mid 90's borns are not Homelanders. No one born before 2003 is truly a Homelander. Period. I can be a Zoomer, sure, but I'm not a Homelander.

I know you would get mad if someone kept telling you that are Gen Z because of Pew's 1997-2012 definition. I know you would be upset being grouped with a 2012 baby."
8238,2020-12-25 09:56:33,kjqwe9,You were alive for three months you‚Äôre a homelander lol. Sorry to be so blunt it just is what it is. Idc about this irl. I don‚Äôt have a superiority complex at all. Just call things out.
8239,2020-12-25 10:06:28,kjqwe9,"No. You're not just calling things out. Let me explain this to you 10 more times so you can get it:

A Homelander is a person born AFTER the establishment of Homeland security, NOT BEFORE but AFTER.

A Homelander is a person born AFTER the establishment of Homeland security, NOT BEFORE but AFTER.

8254,2020-12-25 15:48:22,kjmort,Reccomend for sure; it's definitely worth it's praise imo
8255,2021-01-01 02:16:56,kjmort,Great show. You honestly may not recognize him though
8256,2021-02-11 07:29:30,kjmort,"I definitely didn't recognize him. When I read that he was in it I was like, ""OK let me look up what background character he played..."" Come to find out he's one of the main supporting cast!! Blew my mind."
8257,2020-12-29 14:00:38,ki4pti,That‚Äôs gonna be soooooo nice
8258,2020-12-23 06:01:35,ki4pti,"I'm so trying to go to this, but I'd have to see how the vaccine works when those vaccinated are around large crowds of people."
8259,2020-12-21 17:30:09,khlot4,LB and DB seem to the weakest link in the team in my opinion. Sooner than later we also need to start looking for a replacement for Fletcher and his titanic job.
8260,2020-12-21 17:30:07,khlot4,"I‚Äôd like to see some improvement in you spelling their names correctly, and rationale for why you graded some of them the way you did. I mostly agree (with the grades, not spelling) - but there‚Äôs some real head scratchers on this list."
8261,2020-12-21 17:31:58,khlot4,"I disagree on:

RB (C)- Nothing behind Miles long term and who is to say Eagles are in position to extend him with the cap

OT (C)- Mailata a pleasant surprise and could be the future LT as is Driscoll, but Dillard is an unknown and massive resource sink if he ends up not starting and Tega is a non factor until proven otherwise. I feel good about the unit as a whole but remains to be seen if they leave Driscoll at OT or try him at C/G as many predicted when he was drafted.

DE I agree with the C but expect Barnett to walk after the year.

LB is a D because this is a barely NFL caliber unit and Singleton is an ideal backup forced into a starting role. Every single other player is either extremely raw, inconsistent, or awful.

CB (D)- Maddox isn‚Äôt worth an extension as an outside CB and isn‚Äôt physical enough in the slot. Eagles can do better.

This team needs a LOT of help moving forward."
8262,2020-12-21 18:30:32,khlot4,Linebackers are an F. I like singleton but each one of them gets burned in coverage and has trouble reading options and misdirection.
8263,2020-12-21 17:36:15,khlot4,"Darn, I thought I spelled all the names right, could you let me know which ones are wrong so I can fix it?"
8264,2020-12-21 18:16:17,khlot4,"I see Singleton as at least a ""pretty good"" starting MLB. I know he's undersized, but he plays really well."
8265,2020-12-21 18:31:53,khlot4,This. I‚Äôm least concerned about RB because it‚Äôs solo replaceable but agreed. Barnett will be gone especially with cap. Everyone wants to trade Carson but we also take a $60m hit moving him. It‚Äôs a lose-lose. It sucks but we are in a soft rebuild. Then by the time we‚Äôre ready Hurts will need to get paid (if he continues progressing) and we pay or draft again
8266,2020-12-21 17:41:46,khlot4,You‚Äôre good now.
8267,2020-12-21 17:43:07,khlot4,"Yeah I fixed Seumalo and Jacquet when I looked over it again, thanks for the heads up"
8268,2020-12-21 17:54:41,khlot4,"Despite my having led with the snark, I‚Äôd seriously like to know your thoughts on why Miles is the only grade A player on this list. He‚Äôs increased his rushing YPC, yes - but clearly hasn‚Äôt cured his fumbleitis. A small sample size perhaps, but more fumbles in fewer games is a regression."
8269,2020-12-21 19:36:23,khlot4,probably because its a team wide problem. ive just kinda accepted that nobody knows how to hold onto the football at this point
8270,2020-12-21 19:39:33,khlot4,"My reasoning is that he‚Äôs having a career year despite a low amount of carries and a constantly changing offensive line. Yes he‚Äôs had a couple problems like fumbles and failure to catch, which could warrant a lower grade, but those can be fixed."
8271,2020-12-26 06:46:28,khixpi,"It‚Äôs true about the mercy God shows us. I never experienced this kind of love or concern. And I look forward to being with him again one day.

[Message from Dr Jordan Peterson](https://jordanbpeterson.com/contact/): For the last year, I have been receiving hundreds of emails a week comments, thanks, requests for help, invitations and (but much more rarely) criticisms. It has proved impossible to respond to these properly. That‚Äôs a shame, and a waste, because so many of the letters are heartfelt, well-formulated, thoughtful and compelling. Many of them are as well ‚Äî in my opinion ‚Äî of real public interest and utility. People are relating experiences and thoughts that could be genuinely helpful to others facing the same situations, or wrestling with the same problems. 

For this reason, as of May 2018, a public forum for posting letters and receiving comments has been established at the subreddit. If you use the straightforward form at that web address to submit your letter, then other people can benefit from your thoughts, and you from their responses and votes.

8273,2020-12-21 04:01:06,kh95yc,Nakia is right there...
8274,2020-12-21 03:54:22,kh95yc,Dumb as shit.
8275,2020-12-21 03:36:51,kh95yc,"Said this before as I really think he‚Äôs an excellent actor, and got lambasted. I see your point."
8276,2020-12-21 04:56:25,kh95yc,"For fuck's sake, will people stop posting this fucking idea? It's posted like a dozen times a week."
8277,2020-12-21 03:36:14,kh95yc,Either that or if somehow they kept him alive after black panther and he has a redemption story or something
8278,2020-12-21 04:57:21,kh95yc,Okoye too. And M'Baku. All would make excellent Black Panthers.
8279,2020-12-21 04:03:17,kh95yc,The biggest thing that was mentioned is that the heart shaped herb is gone unless they retcon that part.
8280,2020-12-21 03:39:06,kh95yc,He was a great villain that was right in so many ways yet he was under utilized and done in wrong at the end.
8281,2020-12-21 03:47:56,kh95yc,I really don't think that'll work. His motivations were sound but you'd need a *huge* redemption arc to make up for the terrible stuff he did to reach his goals in BP. Especially since we saw Nakia succeed by being almost completely non-violent.
8282,2020-12-21 03:37:05,kh95yc,I think it would be better than Shuri or (weird rumor) M'Baku.
8283,2020-12-21 04:10:54,kh95yc,Easier to retcon that than a whole ass redemption arc with dead Killmonger.
8284,2020-12-21 03:47:14,kh95yc,"He has the acting presence to do the role justice while being different than Boseman. And in the movie canon created, has a bloodline to the throne and is a known entity.  I like the idea of a redemption plot/multiverse twist. However, I think there are many who feel it would detract from the arc his character took in the first movie."
8285,2020-12-21 03:52:43,kh95yc,"Agreed, honestly lately, I've been leaning more towards Nakia as the next Black Panther. We know Lupita's a great actress and can pull off a regal presence. She has the potential for an interesting arc as it was her suggestion to open up Wakanda to the world, so her seeing the consequences of this decision could be interesting."
8286,2020-12-21 04:14:28,kh95yc,There wouldn't have to be a redemption as I stated another universe. Since Dr. Strange has introduced the multiverse it could work how that way. You know like how spiderman 3 is playing into the spiderverse.
8287,2020-12-21 03:49:02,kh95yc,If he was brought in from another universe where he became the Black Panther instead of T'Challa it could most definitely work.
8288,2020-12-21 03:54:53,kh95yc,"I haven't really thought about Nakia being Black Panther much, I'm not sure why. I'm not a huge fan of Shuri taking up the mantle so soon, M'Baku seems perfect to me but there are some issues with the Jibari tribe and his gorilla god vs the panther god, but Nakia is honestly a sound pick. She's got fighting skills, already a diplomat and much more ready for the mantle than other candidates."
8289,2020-12-21 04:54:31,kh95yc,"I'm always campaigning for her to be Black Panther especially when the title will have to be earn by combat.

When all people wanted Shuri i told them it's ridiculous, not because of anything but because even if she could defend herself, she won't last against another contenders. Nakia has that chance, and she's the character who has the right idea when it comes to Wakanda in the first movie."
8290,2020-12-21 04:42:26,kh95yc,"I would really hate that approach to the multiverse. It works fine in the comics occasionally but it'd be so lazy, like just conjuring a character out of thin air, handwaving everything and basically rendering everything about the first movie pointless."
8291,2020-12-21 04:19:03,kh95yc,"But then why would we care about this version of Erik you suggested? He isn't the same version, he hasn't suffered like the MCU version did. He would basically be an entirely new character.

Plus, it'd be easier to explain them bringing back the Heart-Shaped Herb and Nakia, the living character who shares Killmonger's beliefs and isn't genocidal, becoming Black Panther than multiverse/resurrection."
8292,2020-12-21 03:54:53,kh95yc,"I totally agree with the you and the audience is already familiar, but I said something similar months ago on one of the marvel subs and got downvoted a bunch. It seemed to be an unpopular opinion, at least at that time. I mostly really enjoy his work, and would like to see his take on the role as the hero. Boseman was so awesome in the role, don‚Äôt think you can recast. It has to be someone else taking he mantle IMO, and if there was a multiverse way to do it while honoring Boseman I think most people would accept it as he‚Äôs an excellent actor."
8293,2020-12-21 04:03:00,kh95yc,"At first, I wanted Shuri as I did think if there was a well-written arc and proper build-up, it could've worked, but unless the actress apologizes for her recent controversial tweets or a recasting happens, I don't know how comfortable I'd feel if she took the mantle.

M'Baku could definitely work as he is a great character, but at the same time, I really do like him as this cool supporting character whose beliefs/values conflict with the main heroes. Okoye could also work if written well as we know she was helping to take care of Wakanda during the five years, possibly giving her even more experience as a leader in addition to her being a general. Plus, we as the audience already connected to her character and Danai can definitely pull it off."
8294,2020-12-21 05:16:34,kh95yc,"Remember that the trial by combat is normally bypassed. Each tribe decides whether they want to challenge the throne by putting forward a challenger, if they're all happy with the current leader then there isn't even a fight. There was only one at the beginning of Black Panther because the Jibari came in last second and put forward M'Baku."
8295,2020-12-21 05:17:01,kh95yc,"I feel like if they do go with Shuri (depending on how the whole controversy with the actress goes), a part of the movie would be about her training to become ready for the challenge. Or maybe she loses the challenge in the first act and another person is chosen as BP, but circumstances force her to don her own suit and/or consume the herb. We could then see her struggle with these powers and have to learn how to use them over the course of the story, kind of like Miles in Into the Spider-Verse"
8296,2020-12-21 04:49:08,kh95yc,Kinda like Gamora? Black Widow is going to be in Loki and we are getting the spiderverse. So we can probably suspect a lot of retcons and different versions of characters coming in. I mean if it gets too out of hand Deadpool could always kill the MCU and go to a different universe and start there.
8297,2020-12-21 04:22:18,kh95yc,Different universes have different characters with different backgrounds. I'm pretty sure there is a universe where T'Chaka's brother was made king instead of him which would put Erik was the successor to the throne.
8298,2020-12-21 03:57:29,kh95yc,We will just have to wait and see what Feige has in store for us since the movie has a 2022 release date. I'm just curious as to how they will end Boseman's legacy.
8299,2020-12-21 04:21:53,kh95yc,"Shuri can definitely work but she needs a lot more time for her character to develop. While her recent comments have lowered my opinion of Letitia Wright herself, I don't think I like Shuri any less. 

I think the main point to consider is that Black Panther needs to be a great leader and a great fighter. M'Baku was high on my list because he's both, but there are problems with him taking up the mantle, and I agree that he works well as a character that supports but disagrees with the protagonist on some issues. Okoye is an excellent fighter but not much of a leader (that we've seen). She can lead an army exceptionally, but a country is a different matter. Shuri is neither (unless she's using ranged tech, in which case she can hold her own in a fight), at the moment, but can easily become both with some more character development and training. Nakia is indeed both, and has much fewer issues than M'Baku has."
8300,2020-12-21 16:35:17,kh95yc,"Nothing at all is pointing to Black Widow being in Loki so you're just pulling that out of your ass and the Spider-Verse stuff is just rumors*, and  what the fuck are you going on about Deadpool killing the MCU lol. All this BS just to bring back a dead guy to play a character. Everything you say is more stupid than the previous thing you said.


*Yes we have Molina and Foxx, but Foxx has stated it's not the same character and Raimi's Ock died."
8301,2020-12-21 04:24:41,kh95yc,"Then why should we care about this version of Erik. much of why we loved Killmonger in the first movie was because we could relate to him. We could relate to how he suffered and we could sympathize with that.

Here, it would basically be an entirely different character who we wouldn't emotionally connect with on the same level and it'd be far more convoluted to explain why he's in the main MCU rather than just simply have one of T'Challa's supporting cast become Black Panther."
8302,2020-12-21 16:41:50,kh95yc,"Watch the latest trailer to Loki, read the deadpool comics, and yes the spiderverse is going to happen because Jamie Fox is reprising his role as electro and Alfred Molina is reprising his role as Doc Ock. Also Andrew Garfield has a role in the movie as well. The deadpool rumor of joining the MCU will be as a cameo in the next Doctor Strange movie. So why don't you do some research and STFU."
8303,2020-12-21 17:00:23,kh95yc,lol
8304,2020-12-17 22:07:53,kf7577,"Wow, I think #1 actually works. I could've totally seen the country struggling on for 5 years without worrying about a monarch of having their local superhero, but if they did pick new ones this definitely sounds like something T'Challa would do.  


Using *What if ...* for live action is a cool idea, but I think they'd rather keep his last MCU performance whole and release it as intended."
8305,2020-12-17 22:58:23,kf7577,"I think a combination of the first two points makes the most sense, set the movie during the snap, or at least let it feature a lot of flashbacks that take place during the snap, in order to show how the country moves on in his absense and to show his successor finding their feet.  

That way, when the snap happens, T'challa can retire and it will make perfect sense because we've just seen that someone else has managed to fill his place and that he isn't absolutely needed.  

Hell, maybe there isn't even a straight up successor, maybe they transitioned into a more democratic form of government while he was gone, that would also be a perfect reason for him to retire."
8306,2020-12-17 23:16:56,kf7577,Option 2 is what I like. Takes away from the pressure of having to commit to anything for future films. Allows them time to set up the future as well as how it can tie into phase 4 and onward.
8307,2020-12-18 00:26:31,kf7577,"I could see it being a combination of some of these. 1+2, flashbacks to the 5 year gap and T'Challa's absence, Wakanda decides it no longer wants a King. In the present day, T'Challa goes his own way to honor the wishes of the people."
8308,2020-12-18 11:48:25,kf7577,"1 has the unfortunate implication that next time Wakanda is in trouble, the reason T‚ÄôChalla doesn‚Äôt show up is because he doesn‚Äôt care. Superheroes don‚Äôt retire. Even when they get too old to do the physical hero stuff, they become part of the support team for the new hero, like old Bruce Wayne in Batman Beyond. Otherwise you get some pretty nasty fridge logic.

I think that whatever they decide to do long-term, 2 is best because it allows them to set up anything they need"
8309,2020-12-18 11:29:33,kf7577,"I dont see a problem with recasting. Weve had 3 hulks, 3 spidermen, 2 warmachine and 2 adultish cassie langs. Just recast him."
8310,2020-12-17 22:10:09,kf7577,"Man I'm so disappointed they aren't recasting. He only got 1 solo movie and now they're gonna hand the mantle off to another character? He's one of marvel's oldest characters and they're just gonna dump him.

I honestly doubt this is what Chadwick would have wanted."
8311,2020-12-17 22:37:16,kf7577,Number 1 is a pretty good idea.
8312,2020-12-18 06:34:14,kf7577,They will film an heroic death scene in the first action scene of the film. They won‚Äôt show his face and he will go down as black panther
8313,2020-12-18 04:17:11,kf7577,I am with Multiverse
8314,2020-12-18 04:29:38,kf7577,"I can predict he's going to sacrifice himself like The Wasp (Janet) in ""Ant-Man"" to save Wakanda or the world somehow. And this is going to be the 1st scene."
8315,2020-12-18 05:09:50,kf7577,"Or just do a deepfake of T‚ÄôChalla in future films, easy!"
8316,2020-12-17 23:07:43,kf7577,"I like that too! I think they'll keep someone in the suit, but I could totally picture T'Challa saying, ""Wakanda no longer needs a king, and already has a Black Panther"" before stepping down.   


I think 1st act during blip, 2nd/3rd acts post-Endgame as characters get their feet / reintegrate is a great structure for a Phase 4 movie, and lets you have some really cool parallels between characters that were / weren't snapped."
8317,2020-12-18 00:59:30,kf7577,"Even if Chadwick Boseman were still with us, it'd be a great idea. I've been hoping the MCU would explore the time between the snap and Endgame in some property or another. It never occurred to me for Black Panther II, but that'd be perfect - they were ground zero for the fight with Thanos, and they lost their head of state. I'm sure the fallout from that would make for a great movie."
8318,2020-12-18 14:55:39,kf7577,If he steppd down he wouldn't have super powers. There can only be one Black Panther at a time - he'd just be a normal guy with some martial arts skills.
8319,2020-12-18 14:54:14,kf7577,"Chadwick *was* T-Challa though. The only version, in 4 different movies. Ruffalo and Cheadle were both cast as new versions of their characters after single films, very early in the MCU and then *they* became the main version of the characters. This would be like recasting Hulk after *Age of Ultron*, or *War Machine* after Iron Man 3."
8320,2020-12-18 14:11:19,kf7577,3 hulks?
8321,2020-12-17 22:36:33,kf7577,">I honestly doubt this is what Chadwick would have wanted.



Feige probably knows what ""he would've wanted"" more than you since he, you know, knew him and isn't just projecting his feelings onto him because they watched a movie where he was in like some other people."
8322,2020-12-17 22:18:26,kf7577,"I'm disappointed too, but I really appreciate the movies we did get him in, and how incredible the solo movie we did get was. T'Challa just wouldn't be the same to me with a different actor, and I understand why they wouldn't have wanted to bring in a new actor after 4 movies with Chadwick. I really think they're going to be considerate of how big a role model and icon the character was, and introduce a new, different Black Panther that can fulfill the same role and carry on the story."
8323,2020-12-17 23:01:36,kf7577,"Thanks! I got thinking about what happened to Wakanda during the snap, and then realized that if there *were* a different King and Black Panther, it would make perfect sense for T'Challa to honor that and give him a great opportunity to step away from the spotlight he grew up in and start to understand the new world that evolved while he was gone. Then I remembed that there was already a bit of footage there that could probably be used as well."
8324,2020-12-17 23:19:47,kf7577,"I like the idea of the 1st act being before Endgame and the 2nd and 3rd acts being after it.  

One cool thing that that would allow for, is that it could show the final battle from Endgame from a different perspective, from the perspective of whoever becomes the new Black Panther.  

We could follow this person when they react to Dr Strange contacting them, watch them line up in front of the portals, etc."
8325,2020-12-18 15:09:29,kf7577,"Unfortunately the heart-shaped herb is gone so if he lost his powers nobody would be able to gain them.

Yet another reason why option 2 is best"
8326,2020-12-19 09:13:59,kf7577,"Chadwick was the first to play T‚ÄôChalla. That‚Äôs all. We‚Äôve had recasts before in the MCU regardless of whether stipulation you choose to subscribe to.

I‚Äôm still peeved Marvel are going to waste everything Chadwick did for the character by killing/writing him off, but I guess everyone it‚Äôs the less controversial option than recasting"
8327,2020-12-18 14:14:38,kf7577,Yup. Altho i dont think the eric bana hulk is canon to the mcu.
8328,2020-12-17 23:18:06,kf7577,Feige has repeatedly said he had no idea about Bosemans cancer so Feige is just as in the dark on what Chadwick would have wanted as we are. They didn't talk about this and there was no plan.
8329,2020-12-17 23:40:42,kf7577,"Did he actually say this is what Chadwick wanted? I've not seen that quote anywhere. Plus, exec's aren't exactly universal in their honoring of people's wishes so I'd say with all that's been said on the subject we are about even unless you can prove evidence to the contrary."
8330,2020-12-17 22:35:01,kf7577,"To be fair, just because they‚Äôre not recasting him *now* it doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs *never* going to recast. Writing the character out for a few years whilst people mourn Chadwick‚Äôs tragic passing is respectful, but it doesn‚Äôt mean that the character of T‚ÄôChalla is never going to appear in the MCU again. 

He‚Äôs the last ever person to take the Heart-Shaped Herb, so he has to be the last Black Panther to actually be connected to the legacy and have that power set, so that could potentially leave the door open to his return, depending on how they write him out."
8331,2020-12-17 23:38:33,kf7577,"Ooh, a fun side benefit would be getting to use the T'Challa kneeling with all the other heros for Stark scene that was cut."
8332,2020-12-18 15:30:37,kf7577,"That's obviously not going to be a problem. There was nothing at all to indicate that it couldn't just grow back, but it could also be synthesized, or potentially found somewhere else, or perhaps they had backup seeds, or Shuri could restore it from what was left, or a dozen other possible explanations."
8333,2020-12-24 01:59:57,kf7577,"Not exactly. The powers of the herb have been synthetized in the comics. Kevin Cole, a biracial cop who became black panther for a time, being an example as he was given a synthetic heart herb by killmonger and received similar powers.

I think 2 is probably the best situation they could muster, because it allows them to countinue the legacy while still keeping the possibility of a recast down the line when things aren't as fresh in people's minds"
8334,2020-12-19 21:05:52,kf7577,"Not everyone. Plenty of people (myself included) would've much preferred they recasted the role and continue the story that Boseman was clearly eager to play and inspire more people with. I think it comes down to the cast being shocked by his passing and making a decision that is very emotional and personal. They knew Boseman and it's not even been a year since his death, I don't think it's crazy to think they might not be up for a recast if the film needs to come out so soon.

I respect their choice, my main concern at this point is that Marvel doesn't synergize with this very awkward situation and start systematically erasing T'Challa from other mediums just because he's not in the movies. It would be a shame if T'Challa (comic's first major black superhero) doesn't appear in any more video games or comics just because his actor passed tragically."
8335,2020-12-17 23:20:15,kf7577,Still knowing him and having the possibility of contacting his family puts his opinion on what to do to be respectful over anyone here.
8336,2020-12-18 04:38:37,kf7577,"I'm sure Feige knows more of what Chadwick would've wanted, even still. I don't doubt that whoever Chadwick did tell had an idea of what he wanted and probably has spoken to Feige."
8337,2020-12-17 23:46:03,kf7577,"I'm saying that he knows better than you, who did not know him. Just for the reason of actually knowing him in person, he has more knowledge about him than you or anyone here does.

> unless you can prove evidence to the contrary.

Ok, quote for a quote. prove to me that you know what he would've wanted."
8338,2020-12-17 22:59:27,kf7577,"As others have said, I don't really see the heart-shaped herb as a major story barrier here. There's plenty of ways around it - more could simply grow, or be discovered, or there could be a synthetic, or someone like Shuri could work to bring it back."
8339,2020-12-17 22:48:22,kf7577,"There‚Äôs a synthetic herb in the comics, so there are ways to keep the power set going.

Also, they said ‚Äúwe won‚Äôt recast‚Äù, not ‚Äúwe won‚Äôt recast Chadwick for BP2‚Äù, or ‚Äúwe won‚Äôt recast Chadwick at this time‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm not saying that it means that they‚Äôll never do it, but I am saying that they‚Äôll be much more criticized if they do after just saying that they won‚Äôt."
8340,2020-12-18 15:53:45,kf7577,"""Nothing at all""? It was all burned!

They could do a bunch of different explanations, but ""it sure is convenient that we found more heart-shaped herb just as T'Challa retired"" would be dumb"
8341,2020-12-17 23:34:06,kf7577,"Just because Disney's chosen not to recast doesn't mean it's what Chadwick would have wanted. There are dozens of reasons Disney is going this route. Afraid of (stupid) backlash, merchandise, marketing, PR, new female superhero, etc.  

Even if Feige did know what Chadwick would have wanted, it likely didn't factor into why they came to this decision."
8342,2020-12-17 23:56:36,kf7577,"I'm saying provide proof he's abiding by his wishes. Sure he knows him better. I never claimed otherwise. But knowing and abiding by wishes are two totally different things, even if he even knew his wishes on this subject. Knowing someone doesn't mean you know all their desires.

Chadwick kept his illness from the marvel team for a long time. There is no guarantee they even had time to discuss the subject.

I never claimed to know what Chadwick wanted. I simply said, I doubt he wanted this. Prove me wrong and I'm happy to admit it but until them you are speculating just as much as I am"
8343,2020-12-17 23:05:00,kf7577,"Oh absolutely I agree. I‚Äôm just saying that if they chose to, they could use that as a way to bring the character back eventually.

Honestly at this point, with the hot water Letitia Wright is in and  all the multiverse storylines being set up, I think the most likely scenario is going to be bringing Michael B Jordan back an alternate reality Killmonger that became a heroic Black Panther in his reality (with a handy supply of HSH to restock the MCU Wakanda as well)"
8344,2020-12-17 22:52:16,kf7577,"True, there‚Äôs always going to be ways to explain anything in comic books movies! With superheroes where there‚Äôs a will there‚Äôs a way! 

Rereading the statement, honestly to me it reads as saying they won‚Äôt recast him in the sequel since the statement is specifically about BP2 (though I admit it‚Äôs ambiguously worded)

‚ÄúBlack Panther 2, opening July 8, 2022, is being written & directed by Ryan Coogler. Honoring Chadwick Boseman‚Äôs legacy & portrayal of T‚ÄôChalla, @MarvelStudios will not recast the character, but will explore the world of Wakanda & the rich characters introduced in the first film.‚Äù"
8345,2020-12-17 22:51:01,kf7577,"It's way more likely that they won't recast nor for BP 3 or further, but people keep saying ""that just means that they won't recast in BP2"" because they were wrong, what they wanted to happen didn't happen, so they need an out to why what they want to happen will actually happen."
8346,2020-12-18 15:55:35,kf7577,"You seriously think they wouldn't have had it come back in the 2nd movie anyway? it's the only way they get to ues the ancestral plane, which 100% was coming back."
8347,2020-12-17 23:41:03,kf7577,"Everyone who was friends with Chadwick (including a close friend who is directing and writing) are returning. So, are you calling them sellouts who are not fulfilling his wishes for-profit?

And why do you do this when I say his wishes, or what his co-workers might've perceived his wishes were, could have a hand on the decision instead of when random people claim to actually know his wants?"
8348,2020-12-17 23:58:44,kf7577,"And who are you to know his wishes?

It is as likely that you did as Feige did since both of you would be guessing. I'm choosing to go with the one who actually had contact with him, which could at the very least subconsciously affect his decision.

Way more than ""I watched him in a movie, pretty sure I know what he would've wanted"""
8349,2020-12-17 23:10:13,kf7577,"I do *kind've* like the idea as Michael B Jordan as alt. reality Black Panther (*provided it's as N'Jadaka, not some version of T'Challa that just happens to look like him)*, I'd just want to be absolutely certain they don't write T'Challa out of existence when it happens."
8350,2020-12-17 22:58:49,kf7577,"For the record, I was all for Shuri taking the role, but that‚Äôs looking less likely by the day after everything that‚Äôs happened recently. I‚Äôm just literally pointing out that ‚Äúnever‚Äù is a really long time, and if the franchise continues to be lucrative long term, it‚Äôs unlikely they‚Äôll write off T‚ÄôChalla forever, considering how popular the character was, and how often iconic superhero roles have been recast in the past."
8351,2020-12-17 23:10:01,kf7577,"I mean lots of people are disappointed that a character they really like won't be in the biggest cinematic universe of all time, potentially for a while. I can't fault them for theorizing ways that T'Challa continues on in the near future. Plenty of people were waiting for years or decades so they're gonna express their disappointment in an open forum in different ways. People who were hoping Shuri got the throne would probably be doing something similar if Disney decided to recast."
8352,2020-12-18 16:06:40,kf7577,"Well I'd say ""we'll see"" but I guess we never will now."
8353,2020-12-18 00:43:45,kf7577,"You don't know his wishes any more than the other guy, so taking any stance on it is equally baseless."

This doesn't mean anything. They're all under contract. Contracts aren't void in the event that a co-worker passes.  Disney still wants to make the movie ergo they still have to make the movie."
8355,2020-12-17 23:16:02,kf7577,"Hard agree with all that, and if they bring Jordan back to star it‚Äôll absolutely be as N‚ÄôJadaka. 

However they do it though will have to be relatively easy to convey without Boseman having to act any parts, since Disney has made it clear that they will not use Deepfake CGI to pretend he‚Äôs there. If there‚Äôs some unused footage they can bring in from the earlier films that works, and provided his family agree to them using it, they may do what they did with the late, great Carrie Fisher in Episode IX to finish off the character‚Äôs journey (however they choose to do so)"
8356,2020-12-24 02:10:42,kf7577,"I wouldn't mind this actually. A multiversal n'jadaka, potentially coming from a universe where T'challa died at the summit instead of t'chaka; after which he was recruited as the next heir, would be a serviceable replacement for t'challa. 

Plus, if he's a refugee from a universe destroyed by anihilus or the beyonders or whoever they get to be the next thanos, it could serve as an alternate reason for the illuminati's creation"

That said, I *really* think people are overestimating the impact that's going to have on her Marvel roles or storyline in BP2. Just look at Gwyneth Paltrow."
8358,2020-12-18 00:46:47,kf7577,"Like, look at the Joker, Heath Ledger's standout performance and later death didn't stop them casting two more Jokers in other films and making one of them a cringey mockery of the character."
8359,2020-12-17 23:04:16,kf7577,"You could be right. No one knows what Disney will do. Maybe they want to let Boseman's death sit with the audience for a few years so that by BP3 they recast and allow T'Challa to have some version of the original story Coogler planned. Maybe they decide T'Challa should never be played by anyone but Boseman and Shuri will be the sole BP for decade. I think the latter would be unfortunate, so I'm hoping they recast sooner rather than later but we'll see."
8360,2020-12-17 23:21:10,kf7577,"That's fine, you can still express that without saying that you know what the actual man would have wanted better than his friends and co-workers or saying that their belief isn't sincere and they are just waiting it out until they can do what they actually want to do."
8361,2020-12-18 00:50:26,kf7577,I'm not claiming it. He s.
8362,2020-12-18 02:43:41,kf7577,"That's why Hugo Weaving, Scott Derrickson, Edgar Wright, Patty Jenkins, and Natalie Portman all returned even though they emphatically did not want to.

Wait..."
8363,2020-12-17 23:18:22,kf7577,"I'm definitely in the camp that Leia in Episode IX was more bad execution than a totally bad idea, and if there were solid footage I definitely trust Coogler with Feige's guidance to do a better job with it.   


But if it were something like you said, I think it's more likely we'd get T'Challa dying offscreen which is unfortunate."
8364,2020-12-17 23:19:05,kf7577,"Agreed it‚Äôs definitely troubling. No bad press is insurmountable (they wanted to cancel Evangeline Lily at the start of the outbreak for ill-advised comments, and she‚Äôs still headlining AM&TW-Q, but there is a difference between *keeping* someone in a starring role after such bad press, and *promoting* someone to a starring role after such bad press, but we will see."
8365,2020-12-18 03:02:43,kf7577,"That's an incredibly small list for a 23 film franchise and the directors were all more or less fired. They just use the term ""creative differences"" cause it sounds better."
8366,2020-12-17 23:21:26,kf7577,"They have enough time to create an unused footage storyline and do it justice, if they have the footage and permission to do so. Whether they choose to go that route, we will have to wait and see."
8367,2020-12-18 03:06:42,kf7577,"Occam's razor tells me they're not holding Coogler over contract he just may feel differently than you do, even if it pains you. Such a difference is way bigger than any other of those was bound to be."

8369,2021-01-01 15:07:56,kevcqm,She's just playing statistics and asked if I would bet against it. I said nope.

8371,2020-12-17 16:24:26,kesjtt,"It is nearly impossible for a beginner to sculpt a bust correctly the first time, because in our mind we tend to see a face as a nose, two eyes and a mouth. With this information, the result will often not look pretty.   


To put the 3D forms into a correct alignment, we have to visualize the very, very rough shapes of the head. We have to start with the main form of the cranium, the jaw line, even the neck and shoulder muscles. Then we have to cut into the general planes of the face, make very sharp and large corrections to get them into place. ([http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.com/2014/07/plane-heads.html](http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.com/2014/07/plane-heads.html))

You should take your time and spend a lot of it on creating these low poly shapes. If you try to make a detailed nose, ear, eyes, wrinkles or cheek bones, this detail will make it very difficult for you to see what is wrong. I'm sure there are sculptors with a certain experience and working method to make a more detailed start possible, but this is the result of many years of hard work. If you are starting, you should start slow, forget all the details and finish the rough form before even attempting the rest.  

I can also recommend learning how to sculpt a simple skull, as that also carries the information you need to build your bust."
