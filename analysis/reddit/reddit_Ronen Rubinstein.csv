I‚Äôm kinda still gathering my thoughts but initially I‚Äôm still struck by how deliberately and beautifully it was shot. Almost every frame would make a wonderfully spooky standalone photograph. 
I liked how dark it was, visually, with light only coming from easily identifiable sources, the venetian blinds, the reflective stickers on Jake‚Äôs bike, etc. DP‚Äôs are usually hesitant to shoot truly dark scenes throughout an entire movie, so I love it when someone does. This film pulls it off in a way that creates a nostalgic, voyeuristic, semi-fatalistic mood. 
Some shots reminded me of David Lynch, but fetishizing water instead of wood.

I really liked how the scenery and interactions between characters felt timeless, like it could have been taking place anywhere from the 1970‚Äôs up til now, but the presence of smartphones and a couple newer cars made it clear it‚Äôs contemporary. Definitely loved the use of Jake‚Äôs technology and phone to further the narrative. The phone practically becomes a character. That was slick, smart and modern writing.

Jake fully sold the innocence and paranoia. I hope that actor goes on to get more roles.  What a tremendous find for casting. The other actors were pretty flat. I would have liked to see more personality from his gf and best friend but the lack thereof doesn‚Äôt detract from the story. 

While I was watching it, I felt like it was an approximation of the mood the Less Than Zero film would have conveyed if Fox hadn‚Äôt butchered it.

Also, I‚Äôve never been so terrified and thrilled by the sight of a van...the way it was lit in that one scene...

I don‚Äôt want to say anything else bc spoilers. Anyone who liked this movie should also check out Super Dark Times on Netflix. I think Bret would probably like that film too if he hasn‚Äôt already seen it."
19,2020-12-07 18:48:37,k7rbol,Let us know your thoughts. I am obsessed.
20,2020-12-07 18:48:27,k7rbol,can't wait to hear your thoughts. I loved it.
21,2020-12-08 17:27:58,k7rbol,"Well that‚Äôs not mysterious at all.

I‚Äôm sorry you had a bad experience with him.

Most of the celebrities I‚Äôve hung out with have been pretty bland."
22,2020-12-08 17:11:57,k7rbol,It‚Äôs obsession worthy.
