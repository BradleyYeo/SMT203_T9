1,2020-02-05 09:58:25,ez7ajg,A huge fraction of the population probably does.
2,2020-02-05 10:10:22,ez7ajg,Depends on whether you're related to her I guess
3,2020-02-05 09:58:09,ez7ajg,No.  First 9 words are normal.  The rest is up to you as long as it’s legal.
4,2020-02-05 09:58:41,ez7ajg,Yeah she sucks
5,2020-02-05 09:58:19,ez7ajg,Would you have sex with her?
6,2020-02-05 10:07:00,ez7ajg,There is a lot of legal abnormal awnser if you just take the first 9 words
7,2020-02-05 09:59:03,ez7ajg,I didn't sign up for these questions xD
8,2020-02-05 05:35:18,ez4cx6,"I have listened to Billie eilish a little bit before she blew up, and I was blown away just cause of her voice. I don't like her songs, none has any character and they're all pretty much the same but she does have a special voice. I was waiting for her to change her style to find something more suitable for her that shows her capabilities, but you're right the ""attitude"" sells"
9,2020-02-05 16:25:21,ez4cx6,"[Nah.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fvj6PE3gN4o)  (Listen with headphones or on a good stereo, and turn the volume up.)

The girl has talent.  So does her brother, Finneas.  [AFAIK they created all of her music.](https://youtu.be/kpx2-EMfdbg)  Just the two of them and a computer.  No autotune.

Her music isn't tonally complex, but many of her songs have a deep emotional appeal.  The song I posted above is a great example.  It's downright soulful.  No, she isn't Rush or Rolling Stones or Jack White or Oscar Peterson, but her music is creative, unique, and very well done.  Also keep in mind that she's 18.  What were you doing at 18?  I think she has a tremendous talent, and I hope she's just getting started."
10,2020-02-05 16:40:13,ez4cx6,"Could not upvote fast enough. Her music sounds generic albeit with a certain leaning towards an ""occult"" style theme. Neither the music nor the attempt at the Goth image are genuine. Shes following market trends, specifically from within the Hip Hop world, and borrowing them at her leisure. Nothing about her is original."

12,2020-02-05 17:35:21,ez4cx6,"The minimalism aesthetic is something not usually seen on middle-of-the-road radio music, it's usually more of an avant-garde study. Her music bridges that aesthetic to popular appeal. And her success is timing too, because she basically picked up where Lorde left off with ""Royals."" Our culture then began a fascination with precocious adolescents doing minimalistic, darker music."
13,2020-02-05 22:20:02,ez4cx6,"Since Billie has won Grammys, Lana Del Ray should too.  Billie's music sounds like Lana heavily influenced it.  Lana does the sad boy/girl sound very well.  She really deserved some sort of Grammy for creating a different kind of music."
14,2020-02-05 06:26:07,ez4cx6,"Honestly its the opposite for me, I hate her aesthetic but her music is alright for me. I don't get why she thinks it looks good though, maybe she just wants to have her own sort of style to support her brand??? Not sure"
15,2020-02-05 05:35:26,ez4cx6,[deleted]
16,2020-02-05 06:03:24,ez4cx6,I loved a lot of her songs before I knew who she was or what she even looked like. Just heard them on YouTube and downloaded them. Then she blew up. So maybe that's your opinion but its not for millions of people.
17,2020-02-05 07:10:31,ez4cx6,"Im a 26 y.o dude who doesnt follow whats mainstream music. I listen to just about every genre of music and when i first heard her songs a couple months back i genuinely think shes very good

I think she deserves all the praise she gets"
18,2020-02-05 11:22:05,ez4cx6,"Another Billie Eillish post...  


Shes got a unique vibe and characteristics that teenagers and young audiences engage with. Some of her songs are pretty alright but it's a new wave and type of Pop music and I think its good to have different flavors in the musical ice-cream."

21,2020-02-06 02:10:03,ez4cx6,"It's not really my kind of music so I'm not really a good judge, but her vocal performance feels ""flat"" to me. Like she's reading a grocery list. IDK I mostly listen to Power Metal though so maybe that's why it seems flat to me. Everything comes across as bland next to GLORY! HAMMER!"
22,2020-02-06 02:25:06,ez4cx6,"she actually has a really amazing voice, she just doesnt show it off in most of her music for style reasons i guess?"
23,2020-02-05 11:34:19,ez4cx6,">(at 17, suggesting she'll seduce older men lmao)

Thank God I wasn't the only one to find this shit ridiculous 🤣🤣

People just like her because, since she doesn't look like your regular popstar, if you like her, you are ""different"" and ""unique"". This is literally nothing new

Edit: spelling error"
24,2020-02-05 07:20:22,ez4cx6,"Two things I know: 

1/ Music is art 

2/Art is subjective

Things I think (but don't know):
 I have an idea of what good music is and i'm sure you do to but I can almost garauntee our opinions would differ because they are just that.. opinions. Unless you can properly define ""good music"" your sentiment could apply to any popular artist and it would argueably be just as true. 

Btw I actually agree with you for the most part about Billie but i was eventually persuaded to this slightly more holistic conclusion after having this very arguement/discussion at work."
25,2020-02-05 05:33:50,ez4cx6,I'm not a big fan of her or modern pop in general but some of her songs are alright.
26,2020-02-05 16:41:32,ez4cx6,Instrumentals are good.. But her voice and lyrics leave a lot to be desired.
27,2020-02-05 17:01:52,ez4cx6,Yup.
28,2020-02-05 17:02:37,ez4cx6,I am quite fond of her. She doesn’t have to be cookie cutter with an amazing voice to earn your respect. She just has to be her. And who are you to say she’s milking anything? You sound like you’re in an echo chamber with all this recent Billie Eilish hate. Grow up. Stop paying attention to her if you don’t like her or her music.
29,2020-02-05 17:33:32,ez4cx6,"Ngl I can't stand people who say ""They only popular cause of that"" Yes they are popular because of that, and why are u not popular? Cause u don't have that."
30,2020-02-05 17:42:14,ez4cx6,"It’s just pure bandwagon effect, it’s what puts shitty music at the top. Everyone is too afraid to have a mind of their own cus they want to fit in on social media essentially. That’s the way I see it."
31,2020-02-05 17:58:13,ez4cx6,God I really wish mods would delete these reposts
32,2020-02-05 18:15:53,ez4cx6,"Thats right my man! Her music is piece of shit , idk how can someone listen to that without loosig their hearing."
33,2020-02-05 18:26:33,ez4cx6,not an unpopular opinion? literally go on any subreddit that discusses her and everyone says that her fans are just 13 year old girls who think they're depressed because they felt a little sad once in their life.
34,2020-02-05 19:13:14,ez4cx6,Eh her music isn't for everyone. I like it but it's whatever.
35,2020-02-05 19:48:20,ez4cx6,Plot twist. I’m not into her aesthetic but her music is 🔥
36,2020-02-05 21:15:43,ez4cx6,I like Ocean Eyes
37,2020-02-06 01:00:02,ez4cx6,"Every time I see a post complaining about popular music genres or artists, the OP is **always** a fan of metal or one of its variations"
38,2020-02-06 02:43:14,ez4cx6,"I think her music is pretty in line with current trends in what’s popular in music right now. For example there are a huge amount of mumble rappers, and she’s just taken that to the pop world. If you not super up to date she won’t appeal to you, but that doesn’t mean she’s bad."
39,2020-03-29 03:46:53,ez4cx6,"I think she's popular because she's different from the trap rap crap. 

That being said, her music isn't anything special.

I **mildly** enjoy some of her music."
40,2020-02-05 15:01:20,ez4cx6,"Between her bumbling and the beat/soft synth of every song, they all sound like something you'd play in a slasher movie. I feel like I'm about to get murdered, and I cannot understand why anyone likes that outside of an actual horror movie"

42,2020-02-05 11:14:44,ez4cx6,"Billie Eilish is probably the only pop star recently I felt had actual talent and creativity. All those boy bands and girl groups are bland, IMHO.
Have an upvote."
43,2020-02-05 19:22:07,ez4cx6,Her parents are actors and her brother was already in the music industry. That helps too.
44,2020-02-05 21:22:15,ez4cx6,"Seems like every generation has a ""billie elish"";  mine was Arvil. Like most ""musicians"" she's popular only for her looks. She'll be a memory before she's mid way through her twenties."

48,2020-02-05 05:36:29,ez4cx6, I hate everything about her tbh
49,2020-02-05 05:22:26,ez4cx6,"She looks like she does meth, i don't know what's great about her aesthetic."
50,2020-02-05 10:07:44,ez4cx6,Depressed Lana del Rey
51,2020-02-05 13:34:34,ez4cx6,Smash Mouth is better.
52,2020-02-05 14:07:40,ez4cx6,Hate her attitude. That is the entire reason I won't listen. There is no point in making life more negative than it has to be.
53,2020-02-05 15:39:49,ez4cx6,"I didn't really like her until I listened to her album on MDMA, now I don't like her or MDMA any more."
54,2020-02-05 16:18:09,ez4cx6,Tbh I think I could like her but all of the 13 year olds who now squint at the camera on Instagram bc of her ruined it for me.
55,2020-02-05 18:29:44,ez4cx6,"billie eilish is the mumble rap of pop music


she is popular because she was born in a life of privilege to two high ranking music industry executives"
56,2020-02-06 01:32:52,ez4cx6,Like Ariana Grande! Her music is so.e of the most boring I've ever heard.
57,2020-02-06 02:07:50,ez4cx6,"I agree, she sucks"
58,2020-02-05 06:15:30,ez4cx6,"It's all about marketing and branding. There was a distinct strategy and plan put into place to get Billie Eilish where she is now. She's not ""up and coming"" based on anything of her own doing. Her family retained management for her and they did the rest. They literally pretty much says she's an industry plant. Her own managers said it themselves:

"" **BG:** With the internet and social media, the tools are out there for an independent artists to promote their music and brand more than there ever was before. Also, there’s no one way to develop an artist, so there are so many unique ways an artist can build a base without a label. However, I think that Danny and I both feel that our team at Darkroom and Interscope have played a huge role in Billie’s success. ""

I do think that Billie would have had success regardless, as she’s an incredibly talented and unique one-of-a-kind artist. But it’s undeniable that we have seen so much value globally by having such a powerful system in place of people and partners that have worked tirelessly alongside us to make Billie arguably the most talked-about new artist.

59,2020-02-05 13:59:10,ez4cx6,Couldn't agree more mate
60,2020-02-05 14:53:25,ez4cx6,I think her music is disgusting but then again music is subjective
61,2020-02-05 10:40:28,ez4cx6,I agree her music is a insult to the word music
62,2020-02-05 11:38:19,ez4cx6,She needs to open her mouth more. Singing does not mean half assed rhythmic speaking.
63,2020-02-05 19:13:20,ez4cx6,i thought it was the boobs
64,2020-02-05 20:01:38,ez4cx6,I love her songs and music doesn't sound bland to me at all. However I mostly listen for the lyrics and I like the fact that they're not your typical love/break up songs
65,2020-02-05 22:50:54,ez4cx6,Tim Dillon is that you?
66,2020-02-05 23:25:56,ez4cx6,I think she has a really good voice and deserves all the attention she is getting.
67,2020-02-07 07:37:28,ez4cx6,"You can not like it, but calling it bland garbage sound extremely close minded to me."
68,2020-02-05 07:51:04,ez4cx6,"I mean, her lyrics have very deep meanings, and once you get to know them, they're something different. The reason her songs are different from other ones is that she doesn't necessarily have the ""beat drop"" as most songs do. But that's just what is unique about her songs."
69,2020-02-05 05:27:54,ez4cx6,"Yea, not a fan. But I'm also an old dude and I think her music is offensive to my ears. I do like that new Eminem Godzilla song and I can listen to all of that Post Malone dudes stuff."
70,2020-02-05 05:25:30,ez4cx6,Yes.
71,2020-02-05 11:21:34,ez4cx6,"Her voice is incredibly magnetic and mesmerizing, I feel like there’s a sort of special aura around her! All this hype is about her look though, but I think it’s normal when you become popular in the music world. You need an identity and your look is the best way to express it"
72,2020-02-05 13:37:50,ez4cx6,I think you just described all popular music.
73,2020-02-05 12:58:33,ez4cx6,"She's got a voice but her songs are just okay. Before her, Lana Del Rey and Lorde....was Fiona Apple. Fiona Apple is still more talented imo."
74,2020-02-05 14:19:53,ez4cx6,I might be biased since I am a big time queen and generally old music fan but Billie Eilish is good at rythm but bad at melody and harmony.
75,2020-02-05 15:26:58,ez4cx6,"She made a couple of songs I like.. its not really traditional singing but it does fit the music style pretty well. But I also believe its a style that will blow over pretty quickly, there is only so many songs you can do before it becomes repetitive. I mainly just listen to music on the radio so I dont know how half of the artists look. Looked up a Billie Eilish picture recently but I seriously doubt her look has something to do with her popularity"
76,2020-02-05 15:54:11,ez4cx6,Yeah but she got big boobs
77,2020-02-05 17:32:54,ez4cx6,She actually can sing but in her songs she just mumbles because everyone likes that style
78,2020-02-05 05:37:44,ez4cx6,The reason she's popular is because she's relatable. Also put yourself in a at least somewhat sad 14 year old shoes. Then you'll actually kind of get it. It's kind of out of your age range most likely.
79,2020-02-05 08:35:00,ez4cx6,"She's a talented singer, regardless of the individual listener's preferences. The production on her songs is also fantastic thanks to her brother. Personally, I don't see reason to hate on her- aside from a couple of songs gaining traction and being overplayed. 😶"
80,2020-02-05 06:25:34,ez4cx6,I couldn't identify a single BE song if I were to hear it.
81,2020-02-05 08:38:23,ez4cx6,i think its pretty good :V
82,2020-02-05 13:01:16,ez4cx6,"When you don't know what bedroom pop is you, when you think there are only a handful good genres, when you just don't know what music is, then your opinion is very limited.

There are a lot of things going on in her music, it is very minimal but the way her producer plays with the space is amazing, it is not only about her style or voice there are things that you don't pickup but you still like.

Also, if you don't like it is ok too :)"
83,2020-02-05 11:17:18,ez4cx6,Not un popular ugh do you think you are special hating on a popular artist??
84,2020-02-05 12:15:47,ez4cx6,"obviously  
i mean if you find it bland, it is  
therefore anyoen who likes it more than you has to like it for different reasons  
can't just be that you feel different  
no  
everyone else is the wrong ones"
85,2020-02-05 13:25:44,ez4cx6,"I'm not into pop, but I heard a song or 2 from her. I don't know how she looks like. But her songs are fine, so I can see why she's popular. Also her producer is doing good work. Such a unique sound."
86,2020-02-05 13:49:22,ez4cx6,"But also, Billie has had this style since way before fame and despite how much I dislike her newest album, her voice is still pure sultry goodness."
87,2020-02-05 14:05:43,ez4cx6,"I'm not a huge fan of hers but her queiter, more calm songs are actually nice. 

Check out ""come out and play"" by her, it's a great song."
88,2020-02-05 12:04:05,ez4cx6,I want to hate her. But damn her songs are catchy.
89,2020-02-05 15:23:40,ez4cx6,"I feel you but at least even if you don’t like it, the girl write about something else than how big is her booty or how good shés at twerking,  she doesn’t present herself naked or overly sexualised....in today’s market it will blow most of people les mind because it’s so unusual."
90,2020-02-05 20:35:08,ez4cx6,"Most of her songs have so much sub bass that 99 percent of the people who hear it won't hear it because it's on the radio and or they don't have decent sound. Putting bad guy on the radio kills it because it was obviously not made for it. 

Also American Beauty is a thing."
91,2020-02-08 14:30:20,ez4cx6,"I think the problem you face is that you're emphatic that a musician, should they decide to sing, has to sing in a certain style. However, I would argue that saying so is kinda anti-art.

Of course, you're allowed to like and dislike any artists you choose, but the way you criticise Billie comes across as you thinking that the general public - that is, the same general public which decided they liked listening to her songs to the point where she became mainstream - are somehow ""incorrect"" for liking an artist you don't like. If people like her stuff, let them like her.

For instance, I personally don't like mumble rap; I can't relate to it and I just prefer other genres. That's my prerogative. However, if other people enjoy and relate to it, that's their prerogative, and it's not fair for me to say that the artists that they enjoy are bad because of whatever system I use for grading music. Taste in music, as is the case with literally every other art form, is subjective to the individual.

To use your example of the song 'bury a friend' (the ""where do we go"" song), I very much enjoy that song. While I agree with you that her singing in this example is not on the same level in terms of vocal technicality as Ariana Grande, I think that the quality of the song comes from the synergy between how she sings and the accompanying music itself. An Ariana-esque whistle tone would not suit that song at all, whereas quiet singing/mumbling does. As such, I appreciate the song because of how intrinsic it is to Billie's style, and because it's a very different sound when compared to what I, personally, would listen to. However, that's just my view, and I don't expect everybody to share it or agree with it. Again, taste in music is subjective.

I've already written a lot, so I won't dwell too long on her aesthetic. However, the same rule applies - you may think her aesthetic is overdone and outdated, and that's fine. That's your opinion. On the other hand, I - alongside very many other people, I'm guessing - enjoy her aesthetic, and that's our opinion. As I've said twice before, art is subjective, and everyone is allowed to think what they want about her aesthetic choices, and nobody is objectively wrong for having their opinions.

Rather than making objective statements about any artist regarding whether or not they 'deserve' their popularity, at least try to respect the fact that people are allowed to appreciate whatever music they like. Clearly, people like what Billie is putting out, regardless of why you think they shouldn't."
92,2020-02-05 13:09:04,ez4cx6,I don't like either but hey i listen to sabaton everyone has a different taste but i hate how popular some songs can become without me knowing anyone who loves the songs
93,2020-02-05 14:42:17,ez4cx6,Her live performances really changed my outlook on her music.  She is incredibly talented.
94,2020-02-05 10:10:58,ez4cx6,She sounds better than she looks

96,2020-02-05 20:01:24,ez4cx6,it's mumble deppreso pop
97,2020-02-05 06:30:31,ez4cx6,"her voice just seems overly ""moany"" Idk how else to describe it, it just seems try hard. Lorde makes similar music, I wouldn't ever voluntarily listen to her, but I'd enjoy it more often than not. She actually sang & her message gets across, she's got melody too. BE just doesn't have much of that. her whole thing's like ""look how much idc"""
98,2020-02-05 14:08:03,ez4cx6,What voice? She literally mumbles and you can hardly understand her. Listen to some real music and then tell me you like her voice.
99,2020-02-09 19:01:52,ez4cx6,">Also keep in mind that she's 18.  What were you doing at 18?  I think she has a tremendous talent, and I hope she's just getting started.

Not really a fair comparison. She’s an industry plant. Not saying she isn’t talented, but most people don’t have that privilege."
100,2020-02-05 20:01:32,ez4cx6,"I wanna say that OP is just a preteen going through en edgy phase, but I shudder at the idea of someone past their teens with this attitude... yeesh"
101,2020-02-06 07:28:59,ez4cx6,"Not to mention Lana also has multiple kinds of songs. Like Ghetto Baby doesn't even sound like it's from the same artist as Cola or 13 Beaches, but somehow it is and she pulls it off."
102,2020-02-05 11:30:17,ez4cx6,"I like that she likes her style and is taking a more non sexual approach than previously famed young people. That being sid it isn't for me. The music I really dig and what I feel its promoting to younger people. It's a fresh, mininalistic breath on what I feel had become a very one-track radio, and that she is telling people it's okay to have issues and talk openly about  them is great, I think."

106,2020-02-05 15:25:25,ez4cx6,"She is doing her own thing, which I find refreshing.  It’s great to see more darker and experimental stuff on the mainstream."

Do you understand my point now? Billie Eilish and many other people I listen to are certainly mainstream, but it has no bearing on whether I think something is good. I just really think she's quite good and given her and her brothers age, I think they absolutely deserve praise for what they've managed to do in such a short time."

I was a pop hater at some point, now you can see me listening to old Brtiney shit, some Ariana grande, a couple of Taylor swift songs, I look for the producer work than can only happen when a song is empty and air headed, you should try to listen with out judging, I highly recommend it"

There's really no evidence that I can show you that she has capability in her voice, you can also believe whatever you want.

In choir singing and solfège they teach us various ways to practice and ace the notes in a way that we sound clear. Unfortunately, English is not my native language and so my description in all of this is pretty bad. You don't have to pay attention to see that she has great control, and I am referring to live signing not autotuned tracks. She has control, which can be mostly accomplished with practice, but she also has a unique range that's what makes her ""angelic"" . As I said before her songs are edgy, depression stuff that are mostly for teenagers that say ""ugh I'm such an outcast"" or something. Yet, you need to be able to distinguish some things. The girl has voice and that's it ."

Toxic:

Eminem

BTS

Kanye (I am a huge Kanye fan but dudes really need to chill)

Annoying:

Queen

Beatles

NF

Edit: Kendrick Lamar gotta have the most chill hardcore fanbase. Frank Ocean fans are also toxic as fuck"

286,2020-02-04 20:10:31,eyvph1,My guess is that your best covers are the ones you feel confident doing in front of them.
287,2020-02-05 01:55:16,eyvph1,"I think you should just do it when you’re home alone. 
However, that doesn’t always happen. So I would say: since you’re trying to basically “belt” the high notes in a quieter way, you want to learn how to mix them. I’m not sure if you’re a beginner and u don’t know what mixing is, or if you’re an expert lol. But my advice for belting quietly is just to mix so u still get that kinda “chesty” sound while it’s light and quiet enough to not annoy anyone. I hope I helped!!"
288,2020-02-04 21:02:56,eyvph1,"I'd transpose it down to practice the song itself, use scale patterns to extend your range, especially on the words you know you'll sing. Then just practice the original and record the cover when you're home alone."
289,2020-02-06 05:04:00,eyvph1,"There's a few options! 

1) Sing when you're home alone

2) Go somewhere else - car/park/garage

3) Muffle your sound by singing into pillow or your hand :D

292,2020-02-05 00:22:27,eyvl79,"It's interesting to hear about your experience.  I'm a huge Alkemia fan, but I also favor chewy resins and complex spicy perfumes, which is where I think their strength lies.

I'm thinking you should try **Nocturne Alchemy Cinder Vanilla**.  It has a very similar smoke note to Smoke and Mirrors, but with the strong vanilla base you're looking for.  If you want one that's more vanilla forward and less acrid bonfire in your face, check out **Nocturne Alchemy Ember Vanilla.**

Edit: NA's thing is vanilla.  They even tell you what country they get the orchids from."
293,2020-02-05 18:54:38,eyvl79,"I feel the same way about alkemia. I am pretty new here as well and had a sample pack from them where I got a lot of the same scents that you did, and had a similar underwhelming response. There was this weird smell that seemed to be in every one of them that didnt vibe with me and even the ones I liked (madam pearl, vanilla amour, carmen 7) were only about 7.5/10 at best. The house just isn't for me! 

Seeing as we kind of like the same things, I can recommend solstice scents, they have given me two HG scents (lace draped spectre and rose mallow cream) and they are in a similar vein to the notes you seem to like. Nightgown is also gorgeous. 
My other HG is Alyssum House from deconstructing eden, which smells like vanilla flowers, even though vanilla isnt a note, it's all pure floral. Some kind of magic makes it smell so close I think it's incredible. 

I too am in love with almond and in the process of trying to find a true almond with no other spices and a little creaminess and florals, I'll let you know if I ever find it! I just placed an order for a sample of ""more than the stars"" from olivine atelier, which might be just the ticket! 

Good luck! Awesome post :)"
294,2020-02-05 01:27:32,eyvl79,"Thanks for the suggestions! Those both sound up my alley from their descriptions. I haven't really explored Nocturne Alchemy yet, there's just so much it's a tad overwhelming. 

What's your personal favorite from Alkemia?"
295,2020-02-06 02:23:15,eyvl79,"Interesting that you’ve had similar luck with Alkemia! I too got a certain similar something  between many, though not all, of them. I’m wondering if their carrier oil doesn’t agree with my skin. They were successful enough that there are still a few more scents I’m curious about, but there are other houses I want to try first. 

I’ve been debating trying Solstice Scents next, though may hold off a little longer since I’m more interested in the spring/summer scents. Thank you for the suggestions! I’ve been nervous about trying too many florals since some can be headache inducing, but those sound like they’re on the soft side.

It’s not indie but you might want to try my mom’s HG Mandorlo di Sicilia by Aqua di Parma. Almond is supposed to be the main note, which she can smell, but personally I get a fresh bag of Cadbury eggs. I like it but I’m with you, I want that straight almond!"
296,2020-02-05 04:18:34,eyvl79,"I have a hard time recommending NA because they're more expensive than other brands and don't offer samples of the things I like the most, but it's absolutely worth it if the brand overall works well with your skin chemistry and tastes. By the way, I hate leather accord too.  

My top Alkemia scents are Magus, Autumnalis, Stag Moon,  La Flamme, Feulimmort (sp?) and Sigil.  They're all deep and spicy with a lot of complexity.  Ydalir if you think you'd like a bonfire smoke note with resins that are heavy enough to balance it well. 

As Dark Things are Meant to be Loved leans gourmand on me with the coconut and chocolate notes lighting the path through a delectable swamp of dark resins, and it's a fan favorite."
297,2020-02-06 02:29:27,eyvl79,"I’m open to trying something like that when I’m looking for something different. Admittedly, I have a hard time imagining what some of the darker and deeper scents are going to smell like sometimes, so I end up sticking with what I know. For example, I see “witchy shop” as a descriptor in a lot of reviews, and feel like I need to visit one so I can take this smell in haha."
298,2020-02-04 22:57:32,eyuq6z,"Bro, you have such sick/amazing jaw development. Your craniofacial “issues” aren’t issues at all. You have amazing zygos and everything.

I also figured it's not a recession, but my left cheekbone is more angular and defined than my right which makes it appear like that. Idk how to solve that though."
302,2020-02-05 19:16:49,eyuq6z,"Yeah, it might also just be the photos I take which make it worse. Thanks.

Also found out that it's just my right cheekbone is less defined and angular than my left, not really a recession it just appears that way. Good news, for me, is that it'll probably go away with time."

item was stopped in customs and went through a whole refund ordeal which was definitely not worth it

332,2020-03-28 04:13:50,fqbr7x,Dropshipping is now against Depop's policy. Once you get your money back you can report her account and it will be deleted.

335,2020-03-28 09:10:38,fqbr7x,"Might be different for other PayPal accounts, but for both my AU and US accounts, payment goes immediately into a PayPal account upon ordering, and you can take the money out into your bank account straight away. And, the refunds are usually pulled from your linked card/bank account, rather than your PayPal balance.

T&C's of depop/What you are 'supposed' to do might say you can't take the money out of PayPal until the package arrives, but there's no actual mechanism to stop you doing it."
336,2020-03-28 04:55:10,fqbr7x,"I’ve tried to report dropshippers too and the email I received from Depop said, 
“Please be aware that sellers may continue to sell inventory they've sourced from a third party as long as the items are physically in their possession and they've used their own images.” 
So, technically they can drop ship :("
337,2020-03-28 09:06:46,fqbr7x,Open a case through PayPal right away. You can do it under the transaction details you had with them. Write a relatively detailed explanation about your item not arriving. Make sure you escalate the case once you can. That step is crucial.
338,2020-03-28 23:28:17,fqbr7x,"On my PayPal when I get an order, PayPal puts it on hold until the item has been delivered. That’s crazy I thought every bodies did that."
339,2020-03-28 06:08:29,fqbr7x,"99% of the time what the seller does is they purchase the item to make it look like what they are selling is actually in their possession, but what you're actually getting is that item being dropshipped to you, which is why it takes at least 3 weeks. It's sneaky and depop obviously needs to be better about catching this if they care so much."
340,2020-03-28 12:32:07,fqbr7x,"Thank you. I’m in the process of trying but the situation is complicated because this transaction was done as a PayPal guest. So I’m trying to get PayPal to help me open a case so I can escalate it to a claim, but they’re unresponsive at the moment :("
341,2020-03-29 01:21:32,fqbr7x,"How does PayPal know if it's delivered or not?

345,2020-03-29 01:35:54,fqbr7x,"Still strange, even when I have tracked items I get the money straight away.

I looked at your post history to check where you're from and noticed you're new to selling - maybe it's because of that? Paypal held on to the cash from my first couple of orders until it ""cleared"", but now that I've sold 30+ orders, it's accessible straight away. I'm assuming because after multiple orders, I'm deemed trustworthy by their algorithm."

He is then proceeds to fuck her so you can she that huge cock splaying her pussy out wide and her stomach writhing from inside as that monster dick punches up at her womb and guts.

502,2020-04-21 10:17:28,g5cfwl,The body of a 12 year old. Why does anyone even bother?
503,2020-04-21 10:09:46,g5cfi5,She’s such a contrived human being.
504,2020-04-21 17:37:37,g5cfi5,My daughter loves her music and I like a lot of it. I mainly listen to classic rock but she's pretty good. I'd like her to sing some harder rock songs. She would sound great doing a Queen cover.
505,2020-04-21 15:02:57,g5cfi5,How so?
506,2020-04-21 11:38:59,g5cfi5,"You can say that again, I actively hate her."
507,2020-04-21 20:15:08,g5cfi5,"I understand what you mean.  I think Ariana is vocally FAR MORE CAPABLE than any other singer out there.  She has range and power well beyond many other singers.  I think her talent is being wasted on basic songs.    


TBH.... I didn't get her thing at first but I do now having seen live concert footage.  She likes to hear the audience sing the song and then she paints coloratura over it and they scream.  I suppose it works.  Gets the audience actively involved in singing the songs but she's capable of so much more.  


As far as her look.  SHE'S DEAD SEXY.... I don't want her to cut her hair.... and the short skirts etc that accentuate her legs and that spectacular ass.... no issues there either.  I don't need to see her in a bullet bra.  


I'd ALSO love to see her sing rock.... Queen, Heart, Zeppelin.... anything where she could destroy and people would simply have to listen because they can't keep up."
508,2020-04-21 15:41:43,g5cfi5,"It’s hard to pin down, but you know how musicians (especially female pop stars) change their look with every album cycle? Like Madonna had her Like A Prayer/Dick Tracy phase then her Sex/Erotcia phase, then her respectable Evita/Ray Of Light phase? She changed her appearance every cycle. 

Aguilera did the same thing. Gaga too. Even Katy Perry has her bubblegum California Girls then a little darker with Dark Horse then chopped off her hair and is in her current iteration. Every successful pop star has an evolution to try and stay relevant.

Not Ariana. Other than ditching the cat ear thing, she’s had that long high ponytail look with the same fashion and same over-the-shoulder glance, cats eye makeup look for her entire musical career. 

She’s one dimensional, and it runs against the grain for successful pop stars. It’s a turn off for me, not just sexually, but musically and artistically as well."

**We've had to disallow ageplay to stay in compliance with Reddit's sitewide rules against sexually suggestive content involving minors.**

Your post used the word **Teen** which triggered this post to be removed. If your post isn't about ageplay you can either report this post for any reason to have mods review it and approve it or just repost without the word Teen in it. 

**However if this is about ageplay we take it very seriously and reposting ageplay content will result in a quick and immediate ban.**
  
This is a copy of the original post:

Hi redditors,

So here's the deal I'm looking to setup a roleplay where you would play as a r34 character, I have preferences, but if you have one that I know of that you really want to play that's fine by me.

We would start by setting up the roleplay, brainstorming about what kind of relationship we'd have and so on and so forth.

Now to my preferences, note that they might change if I come to think of someone else that i had forgotten

Anime:

All Dragonball girls.

All My Hero Acadamia girls

Misty, May and Flannery from Pokèmon

Sora and Kari from Digimon

Cartoons:

Kim Possible, Bonnie and Monique

Velma

Nani from Lilo and Stitch

Gwen Tennyson from Ben 10

Sam and Alex from Totally Spies

Brandi Harington from Brandi and Mr Whiskers

Any of the girls in Sonic the Hedgehog

Ashoka from Star wars 

Raven, Jinx and Starfire from Teen Titans

Games:

Tali, Miranda, FemShep, Liara, Peebee, Vetra and Jack from Mass Effect 

Undyne and Alphys from Undertale

Ciri and Triss from The Witcher

Kasumi and Ayane from Dead or Alive

Ellie from the Last of Us.

Tristana, Lulu, Jinx and Poppy from League of Legends.

Celebrities:

Mia Khalifa
Emma Watson
Selena Gomez
Miley Cyrus
Debby Ryan
Ashley Tisdale
Brenda Song
Emily Osment
Miranda Cosgrove
Jeanette Mccurdy
Ariana Grande
Victoria Justice

And that's the list for now, note that I'm not telling you to play all the characters from a single show, but I do also not mind if you want to do that.

And of course all characters and participants have to be 18+.

Hope to hear from you soon!

In r/popheads there is a lot of talk of producers every time there’s a new release: Max Martin is a legend for the pop genre, Jack Antonoff is currently one the favorite producers (worked with Taylor, Lana, Lorde), Ian Kirkpatrick (Selena, Dua), Charli XCX is clearly one of popheads’ faves, and she produces for herself and others."

619,2020-05-03 09:43:15,gch4mt,"Its funny you should say that...  

I turned off the radio in about 2006.  I have a rather large music collection so I can listen to music off line.  Yesterday was a really nice day where I was I live and I had to go to the vet to pick up dog food (special diet).  Blaring quite loudly was a Girlfriend from Avril.  I imagine if I stopped long enough for people to hear it I would get a lot of weird looks because I am 37 year old male with a lot of grey bumpin Avril.    

I agree that songs of this era will not have the same staying power as the artists previously.  There are a few that are decent, but not a lot."

Every decade will say the same (though I don't understand the inevitable complaint of how the new artists of 2028 aren't raw, powerful and deep like XXXTentacion or Everyday Bro by Jake Paul) but to me there were times where I can remember being only a child, walking into the Library with Ruby by Kaiser Chiefs playing in my head, (or from a speaker outside HMV, in Argyle Street, Glasgow. Or being on the top floor of MCdonald's staring down at the rainy shopping centre, the bottom floor filled with Emos singing along to Mr Brightside by The Killers."

Hi, *MoistFeature9*!

Unfortunately, [your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/hiploz/-/) has been removed from /r/teenagers for the following reason***(s)*** listed below:

>#2. No spamming.


>**a. Irrelevant Memes**


> * Image macros, memes, copypastas, videos, etc. that are not specifically relevant to the average teenager may be removed. Memes must relate to daily teenaged life; they shouldn't be applicable to other subs or every day people. For example, if it's relatable to someone who is not a teen, it's not suitable for this sub. If it's a funny meme that has no relevancy to specific teenaged experiences, it's not suitable for this sub. Please check you are using the appropriate subreddits.


>**b. Spam**


>* Posts with intent to spam and clog /new/, and/or intent to collect karma including cake day posts are not allowed. Post deemed to be spamming /new/ such as personality tests or question threads are subject to removal if necessary whether or not there is a megathread created to contain these posts. Reposts or extremely similar memes are subject to removal.

>* Submissions that do not create relevant discussion are not allowed. Posts such as ""why was this user banned""; ""why aren’t my posts showing up?""; screenshots of Reddit including a user's profile, r/teenagers or other subs, posts, comments, etc; or images that lack any context fall under this rule.


>**c. Comment spam**


>* Comments with the intent to spam by extremely large messages, copypastas, or multiple repeated comments throughout the sub are subject to removal.


The full extended documentation of Rule 2 can be found on [this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/wiki/rules#wiki_2._no_spamming.), as the quote block above is our simplified version for ease of reading.*

859,2020-07-13 01:45:44,him0o8,"Okay so obligatory ""some of these are actually valid"" but ig the point was to highlight the ludacrity of stan twitter of lumping stupid stuff with serious stuff and demanding the same level of ""cancellation"" for both 

Now that that's out of the way, here's stuff on some more queens, which again, some of it is valid, some is just stan Twitter exaggerating and asking for miniscule apologies again

Katya is cancelled for more than just being Trixie's friend, she lipsynced to the n word too 

And could Bob be considered CANCELLEDT for making a Holocaust joke about Jinkx? Which she actually defended with more than just ""it's just a joke at a roast lmfao"" (which is the more fitting response obviously), but with ""Tell me how anitisemitism from black people affects American today. . . I'll wait. . ."" If not let's CANCEL her for being friends with Bianca and Monet alone! Why not!? /s

Trixie was also at the same roast btw and she made the infamous slavery jokes about Latrice there, but I believe you covered it all with ""by being Trixie"" lmao 

Brooke Lynn is cancelled for posing with someone in blackface and just being Bianca del Rio's friend lol, which effectively cancels all queens, Shangela, Dela, Roxxxy Andrews, Detox, Mrs. Kasha Davis, Ongina, Courtney Act, you name it 

Willam, Charlie Hides, and April Carrion did blackface too. They did legit blackface. But now I'm seeing that Kim Chi's neon runway is also being considered semi blackface? Honestly I'm not black so I would like to know more from black people's POV about its appropriateness (or lack thereof), because frankly I didn't clock it as blackface when I saw the episode

Violet is cancelled for [being racist](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBvrWaJpK9w/?igshid=1oveioc31mtqv)

Also just in, Crystal Methyd is CANCELLEDT for posing with the confederate flag for satire lmao

Also Miz Cracker is cancelled for her name lol"

This is the result of taking subversive queer culture and going mainstream... you’re going to get lots of non cookie cutter gays. 

It’s almost like these RPDR fandom stan people are conservative right wingers dictating how queer people get to inhabit space.

Obviously, stuff like assault is inexcusable. Wish folks would just let these girls make their money and chill out, though. There’s literally kids starving in Yemen and bitches wanna pounce on someone for quoting a queer poet who used the word dyke.

938,2020-11-10 19:11:54,him0o8,"We should cancel Lady Bunny for making a Sahara joke as well. But she’s a ✨LEGEND✨ so she’s basically untouchable at this point. Not saying that’s a bad thing, I’m just saying that she alone has made more offensive jokes than all of these queens combined, & yet we never try to cancel her."

941,2020-07-01 19:33:19,him0o8,"Yvie should be cancelled RIGHT NOW for stereotyping odd people. I mean, how dare she."

943,2020-06-30 23:13:20,him0o8,"Cancel Yvie for not shutting up about how cooky she is and that's uuummm, let me check my notes...abelist, yes."
944,2020-07-02 13:53:10,him0o8,"I'm watching season 11 for the first time while doing home exercises to have at least something on the tv, that's the only reason in watching it. And I can't believe how Yvie won, her fashion is very questionable. She says she is this odd queen, but that doesn't mean her looks needed to be this cheap. Like Sharon Needles, she was spooky and odd, but still fashion.

She is this kind of girl that will deliver you the harsh truth. But as she said in the reunion, maybe she just did it to be messy on a reality tv.

And i fell in love with Brooklyn Hytes. He seems a really nice and caring person. I can't believe his romance with Vanjie was real. Brooklyn is so hot out of drag and Vanjie looks like a Gremlin in and out of drag. And they just kept her until the end because of her romance with Brooklyn, she always delivered those ugly bodysuits.

Akeria was none existent except for the drama she instigated. We need to remember you for your talent mawma, not your drama.

And to conclude my season 11 rant, I liked Silky even though she was very annoying. Maybe because she was always fighting with Yvie and I hated her more. But she definitely deserved to be eliminated in her lipsync against Nina. MEH!"

I think she said something like ""You should feel comfortable wearing girl clothes in the workroom"", and then in their Only Girl in the World lipsync she took Monica's hand at the end and bowed to her, gesturing to Monica as 'The only girl in the world'."

963,2020-07-09 15:30:47,him0o8,"Realistically most of the cancelled comments come from like, a plethora of different age ranges and ethnic backgrounds which is why it's so scary. 15 year old white girls is a bit selective."

965,2020-06-30 23:27:26,him0o8,Exactly. Sharon and Shitty Pie deserve to be “cancelled”. The rest are jokes about Stan Twitter

967,2020-07-13 01:57:59,him0o8,"For real, I have some Drag Race mutuals and they DO take all of this seriously

And now they're cancelling Crystal for posing with the confederate flag for satire"
968,2020-11-06 07:44:54,him0o8,lol yes that’s what we’re gonna cancel Sharon for.
969,2020-07-12 00:58:13,him0o8,Of course they have lmao

975,2020-06-30 20:37:31,him0o8,Cancel Eddie Danger for gyrating on people in Hey Qween
976,2020-07-13 01:59:59,him0o8,"I had to think really hard and Jaida, Bebe, and Shea probably qualify"
977,2020-07-05 17:34:42,him0o8,Yeah. Listen to early episodes of What’s the Tee and she says all sorts of insane pseudoscience shit.
978,2020-12-12 09:32:27,him0o8,And that is DISGUSTING. Gay males and nblm have no rights reclaiming this word
979,2020-07-19 00:28:32,him0o8,A lot of younger generation take offense people weren't born 'woke'. I have been yelled at for admitting I used gay as a insult 2 decades ago. It's a weird world.
980,2020-11-05 22:00:31,him0o8,"I totally agree. Cancel culture has never been about wanting people to learn from their mistakes. It’s always been about wanting to feel superior to them, or getting “woke” points. It’s funny that people even think these queens care about their opinions."
981,2020-11-05 21:57:01,him0o8,It’s not.
982,2020-06-30 12:58:43,him0o8,Omg it’s literally cause she spoke about doing weed in her insta  live and now she’s on the cancel train. But her name is Crystal Methyd... 🤷🏽‍♀️
983,2020-06-30 12:59:50,him0o8,"I thought she was cancelled for even considering the other Snatch game choice she had. (The one Trixie is cancelled for performing as, which led to Transfat making a performance where she hit a Trixie doll with a walker. And led to anyone else who didn't speak out in support of Transfat as being ableist and cancelled.)... These things are getting hard to follow."
984,2020-07-13 01:55:07,him0o8,It's because pics of her posing with the confederate flag 3 years ago have emerged. It was for a satire party making fun of the white trash people who actually believe in it.
985,2020-07-13 02:03:21,him0o8,"I think it's obviously satire, that some fans think they're not just because they bring it up too much 

But no I don't think proof of it being otherwise exists"
986,2020-07-11 08:47:04,him0o8,??? What nude???
987,2020-11-05 21:57:18,him0o8,No one. That’s the point.
988,2020-11-05 21:55:21,him0o8,It’s satire.
989,2020-07-15 02:52:30,him0o8,"I definitely agree that roast jokes are not cancel-worthy, but that take/defense by Bob, if he really believes it, is more offensive and ridiculous than any joke could be.

 DeSean Jackson of Drag isn't a title you want."
990,2020-07-02 16:08:51,him0o8,"Honestly I think putting the serious shit next to trivial crap just makes the serious stuff stand out more. The list at the top is what drag race Twitter is like at the moment, and it’s hard to figure out what’s actually going on among all of the “READ THE ROOM” tweets. I think saying it’s invalidating the genuine claims is a reach."
991,2020-11-05 22:25:57,him0o8,"No. No. No. Jokes are not the same thing as actual HATE. They’re funny BECAUSE they’re so awful. Believe me, I used to feel the same way when I was a teenager (or however old you are, probably younger than me) but you know what happened? I grew up. You have to be able to joke about serious topics, you can’t let them have so much power over you. If you spend your entire life being offended by every little thing, you are going to be MISERABLE."
992,2020-07-01 06:27:16,him0o8,"I know, it’s hilarious."
993,2020-11-06 08:04:29,him0o8,The satire comes from comparing the mistakes made by the other queens to the crimes committed by Sharon & Sherry. That’s what makes this list funny.
994,2020-06-30 17:02:56,him0o8,"I think you need to cancel YOURSELF lol

Edit: Have you noticed that almost every one of these hysterical twinks also posts in r/BeautyGuruChatter ?"

1025,2020-06-30 12:31:07,him0o8,Yeah I still have sympathy for her condition even if I don't like her. Although I do wonder if somebody involved in her life is making sure she isn't hurting herself by performing constantly
1026,2020-06-30 15:50:22,him0o8,"She's also still crying about being called smelly, further incriminating Ra'jah who keeps getting sent vicious hate so she can fuck off."
1027,2020-07-03 01:33:16,him0o8,"Brooklyn came across as pretty cold to me.  Akeria was exquisite on her season.  Watch the season again and I think you'll appreciate her more.

1039,2020-07-01 01:11:28,him0o8,"Yes, this is the ""situation"" she is being asked to ""address"". The Twitter teens are scandalized by her drug use and old thirst tweets (lol you are following a 29-year-old gay man who does drag), but the anger is over the... idea of playing Gypsy Rose Blanchard."
1040,2020-06-30 14:08:50,him0o8,Ah that would make sense! I haven't heard anything except people saying she's cancelled. Definatley getting too hard to keep up with
1041,2020-06-30 21:14:20,him0o8,Wait - what is Tricia cancelled for?
1042,2020-07-02 21:27:03,him0o8,Not when Trixie who is actively problematic is chocked up to “just being herself”
1043,2020-11-05 22:37:03,him0o8,This thread is 126 days old Megan I don’t care anymore
1044,2020-07-01 16:39:07,him0o8,"Screenshots can be altered. Are you seriously telling me I should believe an account that was set-up on June 2020 that is only following one person and the only one person they appear to be following is her. This account is a ""witness"" Really... Im not buying that bullshit. 

Thats an even stranger hill to die on but you do you. We've time and time again, when celebs have been accused on something which turns out to be false. James Charles for example."
1045,2020-06-30 15:59:31,him0o8,Yeah she’s cancelled for endangering people whilst drunk driving.
1046,2020-07-01 15:46:09,him0o8,"Yeah that's what threw me from satire to serious, some of these are really serious awful things to put next to jokes"
1047,2020-07-01 23:02:54,him0o8,"Yes I think that is very valid, but also part of the satire since the twitter stans seem to imply that everyone of these queens is just as bad as these 3 and deserve the same treatment"

1050,2020-06-30 15:25:42,him0o8,"That’s fair! Also, if there’s no credence, it’s probably best to avoid. Although, there are definitely similar accusations for other queens that are still on the sub lol"
1051,2020-07-24 01:21:20,him0o8,Did you also cancel valentina and the fans for racism against nina or do you just hate black queens that much to go as far as to accuse them of transphobia hmm
1052,2020-07-03 22:13:39,him0o8,"Ooh chile, it’s too horrendous to say. She even flicked the persons vagina afterwards"

1055,2020-07-02 17:48:02,him0o8,I know it’s still early but this a top contender for my favorite comment of the day😂😂
1056,2020-07-03 04:12:20,him0o8,Yeah she lacks charisma. But it was the little things that she did that made me notice that she is a good person. Like asking Yvie to show her her moves and also when she let her piggyride her because of her ankle. That was the thing that won me about her.
1057,2020-07-02 21:34:11,him0o8,"Oh, yeah. It must be a lie. Thanks!"
1058,2020-07-13 02:56:05,him0o8,"It's about 2 things: 

1) A 3 year old picture of the Get Dusted girls dressed as ""white trash"" stereotypes in front of a confederate flag has surfaced. Of course now people on Twitter are saying that she and her friends support the confederate flag. It's obvious that they were not actually supporting the confederate flag, but rather mocking it and its supporters. 

2) And even _thinking_ of doing Gypsy Rose Blanchard for Snatch Game, so she's ableist

You're welcome :)"

Don’t you have anything better to do than call queens problematic?"
1060,2020-12-12 11:05:52,him0o8,You can't ask every single lesbian if the world if they are okay with you using slurs men have been using against them for ages! So please if you're a male/not lesbian in general please don't use slurs! You have your own slurs to reclaim

1066,2020-07-02 16:12:59,him0o8,"If I wanted a friend to help verify my account of being sexually assaulted, how many followers and how old does their Twitter account have to be before I come forward? What evidence do I need to provide to satisfy you?"
1067,2020-07-09 19:51:12,him0o8,Is she even a drag queen still? I thought she quit
1068,2020-07-01 21:44:14,him0o8,That's what makes it satire.
1069,2020-06-30 15:40:23,him0o8,"Yeah and I should also mention none of these are necessarily things I think queens should be canceled for, just looking at stuff that reddit flipped over in the past (and mostly forgot about) or jokes! Jokes jokes jokes ^jokes."
1070,2020-11-20 20:12:16,him0o8,"lol I’ve heard people say the same thing about a few queens. They’re trolls, don’t believe them."

1073,2020-07-01 05:02:24,him0o8,Sorry I really don't know how anything I said would make anyone mad? I never even called anyone problematic. In fact you seem to be the one ready to jump down people's throats for literally nothing. Unless you're just a kid trying to be immature online for fun? I won't engage further.
1074,2020-12-12 11:06:52,him0o8,How me and my lesbian friends communicate with each other is none of your damn business
1075,2020-07-02 22:17:05,him0o8,IJS it’s not really raising awareness as to why she’s being cancelled like u claimed
1076,2020-07-01 18:42:16,him0o8,???
1077,2020-07-02 16:51:20,him0o8,"This is very poorly worded. A twitter account made the same month and only following one person doesnt seem legit.. to me anyway. I will awaite to her (Sharon's) response to hear the otherside of the story. 

Maybe 14 year old twitter stans will believe that but I wont."
1078,2020-07-03 14:35:39,him0o8,"damn hope you get some comedy classes after quarantine is over ma'am

or just do it online, they probably have that now"
1079,2020-07-01 00:54:21,him0o8,Because you’re fucking annoying lmao. And you ruin fun things for the rest of us by being moral crusaders for dumb shit all the time. Surely you can’t be that blind.
1080,2020-12-12 11:21:18,him0o8,Are you a lesbian yourself?
1081,2020-07-02 23:06:52,him0o8,"Honestly I think the Trixie “cancelling” IS one of the stupid ones, and everybody involved should be embarrassed."
1082,2020-07-02 18:33:22,him0o8,"I’m being serious. How old would my friend’s account need to be? How many people do they need to follow?
If I asked my friend to help back up my account of being sexually assaulted, so they made a twitter account to do so, how long after making their account should they wait? Should they be active for a while first?
What do you personally need in order to believe their account, given you’re waiting for Sharon’s side? You’ve already decided you don’t believe it."
1083,2020-07-04 02:25:38,him0o8,"no satire is when you muddy your point by purposefully obfuscating what you're saying don't you know the classic quote about satire:

""Satire *doesn't* require~~s~~ a clarity of purpose and target lest it be mistaken for and contribute to that which it intends to criticize""

god read a ~~book~~ twitter thread sweaty"
1084,2020-07-03 22:13:55,him0o8,Idiot
1085,2020-07-01 02:13:02,him0o8,You sound old and very bitter lol

1087,2020-07-02 23:34:47,him0o8,K well you’re not everyone
1088,2020-07-02 22:06:38,him0o8,"Twitter is such a huge platform, I would find it incredibly unrealistic that someone who has been to see the queens on tour and taken pictures with Michelle Visage would not have a twitter account. I dont believe a twitter account that appears in the same month as allegations appear, has a little following is real. I am sorry. That is very off, if you want to do believe then you do you. 

""Oh yes in the middle of someone making ALLEGATIONS, a mystery account appears with no following to back it up"" Im sorry that line of logic isnt working for me. 

Sharon has every right just like Alaska and Michelle to rebut these allegations. If their false then an innocent man has been smeared on the internet (which has happened before). If not then Sharon should face the consquences."
1089,2020-07-18 17:58:31,him0o8,"I don’t know if you purposely said sweaty instead of sweety but I’m honestly living for it.

1093,2020-07-02 11:02:01,him0o8,Your time left on this earth is too short to be this mad take a yoga class at the old folk home and have a pudding cup

1095,2020-07-02 23:40:41,him0o8,"Do you under what the term ""face the consequences"" means???"
1096,2020-07-01 06:44:14,him0o8,"Honestly... wow. I’m sure you can say similar things about mine, but your post history is maybe the most toxic I’ve ever seen on Reddit. Literally all you do is call people names, cuss people out, spit poison at Americans, and criticize. I thought I was bad, but you are WAY worse.

Clearly this is a vent account for you to express anger. I should know - I do it too. You just do it WAY more than me. Maybe pick up some other hobby to get your energy out other than tearing people down online. You’ve inspired me to do the same."
1097,2020-07-02 23:42:24,him0o8,Do you think wealthy people with loyal fanbases often “face the consequences”?
1098,2020-07-01 06:45:54,him0o8,That's alot of emotion
1099,2020-07-02 23:43:49,him0o8,"They should, if their guilty of wrong doing. However, their is two sides to this story innocent till proven guilt."
1100,2020-07-02 23:54:22,him0o8,"I didn’t say should they, I said do they. Abuse/assault/rape can be nigh impossible to prove, and even when you do there’s no guarantee the abuser will receive an actual punishment. Look at Brock Turner. The SheMZ challenge lasted longer than he was in jail."
1101,2020-07-03 00:14:56,him0o8,"Women or Men who are raped struggle to come forward due to people who make up fake reports. Do you realise how to intensifies a true victims struggles?. Its not impossible to prove rape, its allowing victims to come forward without fear of being ridiculed. I am sorry I dont believe in a note pad, account on twitter. Or random twitter accounts thay pop up to ""back her up"" we've seen this happen before.

Ill always stand by the victims and even I could see the BS in her evidence. Its the James Charles effect in full swing. I've seen Sharon compared to Sherry Pie, the difference between Sherry and Sharon is that Sherry admitted to her abuse where as Sharon is going to deal with it. 

Btw Brock Turner's sentence was white privilege in action."
1102,2020-07-03 00:25:27,him0o8,"I didn’t come forward when I was raped because of fear I wouldn’t be believed “without proof”, and not the estimates 8% false rape claim. 

Brock Turner was both white privilege and rich privilege."
1103,2020-07-03 00:32:07,him0o8,Where did you pull thay statistic from... again I am not believing a note pad accusations on twitter with very sketchy evidence. Its estimated by MET that over 63 percent of rapes aren't reported. Huge proportion of this is due to stigma.
1104,2020-07-03 09:37:28,him0o8,"It’s an FBI statistic. In the UK it’s a lot lower, around 3%. 

You’re so close to getting it with your last sentence."
1105,2020-07-03 09:55:36,him0o8,Yes stigma caused by those who falsely report abuse.
1106,2020-07-03 10:13:45,him0o8,Just so close.

The overachieving popular older sister who pushes me to stay in great shape and comforts *me* when I come home alone from a party.

**Useful Notes:**

* For videos shorter than one hour  
 Time: mm:ss --> (00:00)
* For videos longer than one hour:  
 Time: hh:mm:ss --> (00:00:00)
* Make a new timestamp anytime something happens to break the flow of audio, like a presenter finishing a paragraph, a large cut in the video, or something similar. You don't have to do it for every single line of dialogue. 
* There are **two spaces** after the timestamp, then a **return/enter** to make it look:
 
like  
this

* ...instead of:

like

this

* We **highly recommend** using [oTranscribe](http://otranscribe.com/) to help you with transcribing videos. Just give it the file or YouTube link to the video you are transcribing and copy / paste your finished work to the comment fields.

> LONDON - The brother of the suicide bomber who set off an explosion at a 2017 Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, killing 22 people and injuring hundreds, was sentenced Thursday to a minimum of 55 years in prison.

> His elder brother Salman Abedi, who set off the bomb, died in the May 22, 2017 bombing at the end of the concert.

> Judge Jeremy Baker said during Abedi&#039;s sentencing hearing that the two brothers were &quot;Equally culpable for the deaths and injuries caused by the explosion.""

1188,2020-08-20 18:30:13,id9kvn,"All of those are based on religion. Maybe the problem is extreme belief. (Not defending the far-right, as that is relative per-country)."

1193,2020-08-20 19:03:07,id9kvn,"might not be by the definitions you are using, but in the USA it is protected by the regious freedom act. If someone believes that strongly about spiritual beings, it becomes a religion."
1194,2020-08-20 19:05:10,id9kvn,They don't believe in any. Lack of belief isn't a belief.
1195,2020-08-20 19:17:54,id9kvn,"It absolutely is. Atheists are staunchly AGAINST any sort of god. That is a very strong belief. 


Now Apatheism or Agnosticism  are not religions, as people simply do not care."
1196,2020-08-21 00:06:41,id9kvn,"Atheist here, can’t agree with you there. I just think it doesn’t exist, not that I’m against it."
1197,2020-08-21 01:58:37,id9kvn,"Atheist here. I'm not against religion or God at all. 

Religion has provided an unbroken discourse of ideas for thousands of years. It's fascinating.

Believe whatever you want to believe. 

Pray to whatever divinity brings you peace.

Cover yourself in chocolate and dance under the full moon. Whatever. Your choice.

Atheists don't believe in any god. That is their only defining characteristic.

Please don't put words in our mouths.

We don't all have a flag to wave."
1198,2020-08-20 19:19:26,id9kvn,Yeah he was one of those.

I'm looking play as the little starlet Ariana Grande today. Wanting to have her tiny body used and abused in every way imaginable. I am generally very submissive and like to be push/forced into this but happy to try more consensual roles where I come onto you.

This could be done in any scene you come up with. Incest is a big turn on so anything with my brother, daddy or uncle (maybe even all at once!) We could be at a family party or back home for Christmas. Other ideas could be a fan, manager, family friend whichever way you want to take this I'm haply to hear it!

Helps if you send a picture of Ariana in the cloths you want her in for the rp.

1324,2020-10-11 12:48:56,j8mcw1,"I got you my friend. Marilyn Manson is the same way as Grimes on terms of look and persona. I.e they both dress to let the listener who sees the music and sees the outfit make there own conclusions. Manson has more challenging questions to life and grimes has the same but Grimes shows her love for her fans in the music she has therefore making it more happy and makes the listener appreciate things in life more than question them. Look at Grimes pic and mansons pic and you will see what I mean. 
They both have the same performance art makeup for stage effects most of the time

This is Opinion guys don’t tear me apart!"
1325,2021-01-12 13:55:56,j8mcw1,"So... I think it has something to do with percieved authenticity, or rather the lack thereof. A general sense of artificiality, produced for capitalistic gain and not for honest expression of self or art.

It makes me sad that more and more artists give me this kind of feeling, the peak of which was reached when I found out about K-Pop, an industry which in many more ways than we probably know about mirrors the of the music industry."
1326,2021-01-12 14:00:16,j8mcw1,"I'm trying to! And really this isn't about Grimes specifically, it's about upheld artists with a lot of money and strange personal politics. Things like her relationship with Elon Musk, yet supposed support of Bernie Sanders: HYPOCRISY! I can not call it anything else. And it scares me. 

 ""While Grimes arose as a darling of the left, Musk's still somewhat murky politics reflect the libertarianism typical of the Silicon Valley's new tech elite. He's donated to both Republicans and Democrats, and claims to be ""openly moderate."" The personal turned political for Grimes when [she caught heat](https://metro.co.uk/2019/02/06/ive-said-elon-musk-reveals-true-political-beliefs-8459377/) for trying to defend Musk's donations to Republicans and alleged union busting, much to the ire of Twitter.

The whole thing, as it turns out, is centered around my hatred for capitalism and the way it turns so many artists into cash cows for corporations and also makes any and all political statements against the status quo into almost exclusively aesthetic choises."
1328,2021-01-12 14:03:52,j8mcw1,"Agreed!

I was freaking confused, but have now found clarity."
1329,2021-01-12 14:10:19,j8mcw1,"Yes, kind of.

I feel as though some of the artists mentioned tries to provoke their audiences just for the sake of it, and their actual message or intentions are just left unexplored while huge effect shows, elaborate music videos and costumes are thrown at us at a rapid pace.

So there's some kind of attempt at alluding to depth, subversion or rebellion while nothing is actually expressed except vague or feigned emotions."

1419,2020-11-10 11:40:58,jqyz19,"YTA - for the whole “blunt” thing which is really just rudeness but I also want to point out something in your edit: “well I guess I’m just not supposed to have an opinion.” 

Don’t pretend you’re stupid. Of course you can have an opinion, we all do. It’s your inability to shut your mouth at let people learn things for themselves that makes both “the” asshole in this scenario and “an asshole” in general. The idea that you’re the FIRST person in the world who has realised that this guys music dreams are unlikely is arrogant as all hell. 

My sister in law got a similar degree and no, she’s not famous. She’s now a producer at an ad agency that does music bits for commercials. As she is now SAG, she’s got killer insurance and makes a pretty decent living (college debts nearly paid off as well). 

You don’t know what this guy is going to do with that degree. 

I get that if someone is on the cusp of ruining their lives or making a very dangerous choice, you should step in. I also understand that it’s not realistic to not have an opinion of others. The real wisdom here is knowing when to say something and when to shut up. Also learn to have more positive thoughts of others. Why hadn’t it occurred to you that he might be able to do something else with that degree? Send him some good vibes and carry on with your life. 

But if your whole defense is “well sorry I’m blunt,” or “well what I’m not supposed to have an opinion?” instead of ACTUALLY considering how you might be making someone feel, then yea, you are an asshole. Go be an asshole somewhere else and let your friends live their lives without some snobby friend bringing them down."

Okay, well, I'm probably 12 years older than you, and I've also had my ""life struggles"" so I'm going to give you a piece of advice too: don't be a dick, don't offer unwanted advice, don't think that being ""blunt"" is going to win you any friends. Be kind."

1425,2020-11-09 15:34:24,jqyz19,"YTA. Let's review: you had an opinion about your friend's future & career, his choice of school, what his tuition is, and you started a conversation to shit all over his life. For future reference:

Blunt person-someone ASKS you for your opinion, and you give it, (Bonus life points if the person also realize that human beings have feelings that matter, and kindness can go hand in hand with blunt if one takes time to consider how those words could be received.)

AH-rude people who start conversations so TA will have a chance to lecture others about TA's opinions on life that no one asked for anyway.

The AH may ask: ""But how will they know they are wrong if no one asks? I must tell them, right?"" Answer: ""This is why you'll end up alone. No one likes being friends with people who shit all over their dreams."""
1426,2020-11-09 15:17:43,jqyz19,"YTA. You initiated the conversation because you wanted to shit on his dreams. There's nothing wrong with being blunt and to the point when someone asks your opinion or for information, but that's not what you did and probably not what you usually do."

Those questions are none of your business! Nor should you be asking them. That is a conversation best left between him and his parents.

Truth doesn’t have to be brutal. If you feel it necessary to share your truth with someone you can do so gently and kindly. Your “bluntness” is reading as cruelty. It makes people angry and defensive- it shuts down their ability to hear what saying and digest it. If you want to help and that’s *really* what motivates you, then you will find a way to deliver your truth with kindness and empathy. 

Remember sometimes people already know the truth you want share, you bluntly bringing an unpleasant reality isn’t helping them, it’s rubbing their nose in shit. Which brings me to option four: silence. When in doubt silence is always an option.

You’ve expressed a fondness for blunt truth, here’s one:  polite social lies are an important part of normal human interaction- harmless little fictions to preserve feelings or dignity. If you haven’t taken that on board, or learned to share painful truths in a compassionate way then you aren’t wise enough to be dispensing advice. You’re doing more harm than good.

So I'm just going to put it out there that I'm a pretty ""blunt"" person and I tend to tell things how it is. I'm not someone who ""sucks up"" to people. My issue is... am I being the asshole when I tell people certain things they need to know about life? Success doesn't come easily and people need to know it takes a lot of hard work and dedication.

One particular example is, I know a person who is going to a private music school where tuition is ~$17k a semester(so that's basically $136k for 4 years). I asked him what he wanted to do and he said he wanted to be basically an artist/producer(think like a big singer like Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Eminem, etc...). He has some songs out on some website that only have ~100 views and I listened to them and tbh I did not think they were great. I asked him what kind of audience was he targeting. He told me ""whoever likes his stuff."" That didn't make sense to me because in one of his songs the lyrics talk about a cat but then it also has cuss words, so the lyrics are like catering to a young audience(kids) but then with cuss words that wouldn't work. I asked him if he had a ""Back-up plan"" in case this thing didn't pan out for him and he said no. I told him that he's free to pursue his dreams but if they don't work out he needs to have another plan. How is he planning on paying that kind of tuition? He got upset with me for being a ""downer"" and not believing he'd make it. 

AITA for being realistic?

1447,2020-11-10 20:11:28,jqyz19,Anyone who says they’re “just being honest” or “blunt” is almost always just using it as an excuse to be a dick. YTA.

Yep, YTA

>however, a few of you have decided to attack my personal character while knowing nothing about me, and that's not cool.

So now you know what's the problem with being a ""blunt person who tell things how it is""."
1449,2020-11-19 03:21:56,jqyz19,YTA. That music sounds sick as hell
1450,2020-11-10 19:13:12,jqyz19,"Alright, as much as I agree with the majority of the comments here, I think this situation alone, based on what you shared with us, doesn’t make you an AH. (Though, to be clear, in my experience people who advertise themselves as “telling things like they are” tend to be unpleasant. As someone else said, tact is actually a good trait).

I went to an arts high school and I see so many of my friends and classmates trying to make it in LA/NYC as artists after having burnt out of expensive art schools. A backup plan for pursuing the arts is essential— it’s a sad reality, but hundreds of thousands of other people think they have that x-factor, and they very well might, but if they don’t have the resources, money, or connections, their chances of ‘making it’ or even making enough from their art to pay off school are slim. 

That being said, your AH status is completely contingent on *how* you asked your friend if he had a backup plan. 

A NTA from me, depending on whether we learn more about this situation.."
1451,2020-11-10 11:16:58,jqyz19,NTA as long as you said it nicely.
1452,2020-11-10 10:40:08,jqyz19,"That and usually the ""I'm blunt"" people are almost always mean with what they say to."
1453,2020-11-09 16:42:34,jqyz19,">What, you have a problem with people bluntly telling you you are being an absolute asshole?

No, I don't have a problem with it, I just didn't think that'd be the reason for people to be already be influenced by bias before making their judgement.

>Imagine how much worse it would feel for your friends to start telling you the truth unprompted and judging your every assholish decision.

Don't know what you're trying to perpetuate here but I'd rather people be honest with me then lie to my face. If they have a problem or issue with me, I'd rather they tell me so we can address the issue instead of pretending everything's fine and dandy. I made this post to find out if trying to tell people what would be ""best(in my opinion)"" for them was me being an asshole and the takeaway I got is, if people didn't ask me for my opinion, I shouldn't say it. I didn't come here to be attacked on my personal values."
1454,2020-11-10 18:10:03,jqyz19,Hilarious!!
1455,2020-11-10 11:35:48,jqyz19,"They also like to use, ""I'm just being honest.""

I can't understand how people are so self-centered that they can't understand the value of using a modicum of tact. Shitting on someone's dream, telling them their music sucks (which is exactly what ""Do you have a back-up plan?"" is right after you listen to their music) is just being mean. 

Being ""honest"" is not  the same thing as attacking people because you're a 30 year old edgelord who is just soooo above everybody else and doesn't bow to the will of other people like some plebe. 

YTA for sure."
1456,2020-11-09 15:04:34,jqyz19,I agree. The post reminded me of all the people who were doing horribly at life but felt the need to tell me I was doing everything wrong when I was in college. There isn't one bit of unsolicited advice from those people that I took.

So I'm the asshole for wanting what's best for them, if they didn't ask for my advice? Is this how it feels trying to be a parent when your kid doesn't listen to you?"
1458,2020-11-09 15:11:52,jqyz19,"Exactly. Genuinely blunt people are blunt when they are **ASKED** their input on a subject. Not so genuinely blunt people use it as a way to act like they're more knowledgeable, while that could be true, and as an excuse to be a patronizing asshole."
1459,2020-11-10 13:34:40,jqyz19,"Out of all the posts, yours was the most insightful but I don't appreciate the condescending tone. 

>You don’t know what this guy is going to do with that degree. 

Yes, for now, my point was that this person should have another source of income(aka a back-up plan), in case his music career doesn't work out. Your sister in law found something else, she didn't try to force it and be a singer. 

>But if your whole defense is “well sorry I’m blunt,” or “well what I’m not supposed to have an opinion?”

Not my whole defense, I just feel like people need doses of reality. How many times has life turned out exactly the way you planned it? I just don't want this person to end up with heavy student debt and no way to pay it back. Why do you think the US has a problem with student debt in the first place? I worked while I was in college, it's how I managed to pay for my costs, my tuition was also 1/4th the amount of this person's per semester."
1460,2020-11-10 12:25:17,jqyz19,"Yeah you never hear anyone say “I’m blunt and honest and I tell it like it is—and you’re amazing! You’re doing a great job!”

It’s always an excuse for being cruel."

1464,2020-11-10 19:59:55,jqyz19,"It also never fails how original people think they are when they shit on an arts education. Oh, a back-up plan you say??? Why thank you, haven't heard that 1000 times already!"
1465,2020-11-09 15:15:09,jqyz19,"They aren't your kid, though? Horrible comparison. 

Parents have legal and moral duties to their children to craft them into happy adults who can contribute to society in some way. Children do not have the same capability to make logical decisions as people who are older. Instead, you're just someone he happened to meet along his life journey. 

No one asked for your advice, so don't give it. I'm assuming he's an adult, so he can make his own decisions. If you don't like those decisions, don't be friends with him. Point blank."
1466,2020-11-09 15:31:02,jqyz19,"You’re not the asshole for wanting good things for someone, but you are the asshole for being rude, annoying, and controlling. It’s not your life, not your business.

1470,2020-11-10 14:40:45,jqyz19,"Why are you allowed to be ""blunt"" and ""tell it like it is,"" but everyone else has to watch their tone and coddle your feelings? 

You're living up to every stereotype of every AH who's ""just being honest."""
1471,2020-11-10 13:43:27,jqyz19,"You’re debating me on the merits of what you told this guy, which are *probably* correct. But that’s not the issue here: the issue is whether it was appropriate for you to tell him this. Which I believe it was not. If anything you’ll just make him more defiant to prove you wrong. 

The determining factor in whether or not he’s flexible enough to do something different with his degree is not you giving rude, unsolicited advise disguised as a “dose of reality.” Only time will tell what this guy will do and how resilient he is. 

I also understand what you mean about student debt and responsible assumption of debt when you’re young. Again though it’s not your job to mention this to him. At MOST, and only if asked or there was an opening, you might ask when his loan payments start and where he might work right after graduation (“have you looked at the advertising industry? I heard they pay pretty well and let you access their recording equipment after hours...”) Even then, you’re treading. 

I’ve been the blunt friend. Most of my friends would still tell you I’m pretty blunt but I like to think I’ve tempered this to opinions about other things (the student debt crisis in general), not people. 

Remember just because you feel the need to say something and that what you’re saying is probably correct, doesn’t mean the other person needs to *hear* it or is even capable of hearing it right now. You’ll get a LOT further by being a supportive and empathetic friend in general."
1472,2020-11-10 15:02:23,jqyz19,People who like to think of themselves as “brutally honest” are almost always a lot more enthusiastic about the brutality than the honesty.
1473,2020-11-10 12:42:10,jqyz19,"By mentioning I was blunt, people were at a disposition to judge me before reading through the scenario. This is a form of bias. It's a mix of confirmation bias and anchoring. I won't disagree with your other statements though."
1474,2020-11-10 23:35:33,jqyz19,Right? Like anything that isn't STEM is somehow worthless because it's not working for a company. It's gross.

This place isn’t for people to personally attack people who post, especially when other people don’t know a thing about me. Trying to worry about other people but disregarding how they feel is different than straight up telling people that they suck. How would you like it if people attacked your personal character or thought you were a terrible person just because you thought you were just trying to help someone?"

1555,2020-11-09 08:46:17,jqscwe,"bland or dream pop is a new subgenre of pop that talks about sleeping,  dozing off, and napping with the use of 80s synths, electric guitar, reverb snares and funky bassline but can get you to sleep in no time.

cardigan, Boys Will Be Boys, when the party's over, Blinding Lights, Replay and Dreams are some classic example.

1562,2020-11-09 07:17:44,jqrqml,"Actually Folklore probably had such high numbers BECAUSE it was dropped the same day of. ariana wouldve likely seen higher number than these had she dropped the same day she tweeted her album was coming.


that being said, these numbers arent bad at all. anti by rihanna debuted w 166k and that was a huge album. And 100k-300k has always been where ariana falls when it comes to album sales. like rihanna, shes known to the public more for her hit singles and personality. not really concerned about it, and it feels like she is starting to step out the box at her own pace. my hair and love language are clear indications that shes growing and not stalled creatively like many reviews try to say."
1563,2020-11-09 13:09:52,jqrqml,"firstly, she still got a #1. that's huge and congrats to her. 

there are a few factors behind the low sales. i think the two most important ones are the new billboard rules and the timing of the drop. 

the new rules don't count merch or tour ticket bundling, and physical copies count the week they're shipped rather than the week they're sold. this is especially impactful for vinyls, as those sell a lot but they take forever to manufacture. with the new rules, taylor's folklore drop isn't doable any more (tons of merch bundles, 16 different physical versions, selling vinyls that aren't made yet and won't ship for 3 months). ari didn't even do preorders, positions had 7 physical versions and one lot of signed CDs that sold out in under an hour. i think if she'd had preorders and vinyls ready, numbers would have been higher.

in terms of timing, i think the election definitely played a role. i'm not american but multiple americans on popheads mentioned listening to very little music last week because they were just tuned into CNN 24/7. i'd be curious to know the impact of the election on listening as a whole, maybe spotify will release numbers. 

other factors are the minimal promo (some social media stuff and one zach sang interview), the lack of pop banger lead single, and the style being different from tun. she's also always been quite low with pure sales.

that said, i think it's fairly clear that she wanted a low-key era. she chose the timing, she clearly wasn't aiming for another culturally impactful moment like tun releasing the weekend before the election. there's a lot more promo and sales stuff she could have done but didn't. i interpret that as her not being too bothered about making this a huge moment, and a continuation of her just release music when she wants to vibe."
1564,2020-11-09 11:24:29,jqrqml,I think her life being “normal” right now has a lot to do with it to. Taylor dropped that album and everyone knew there would def be references to scooter and the label stuff. Sweetener and tun happened after really big events in aris life. Right now she’s in a good “uneventful” time in her life so she’s probably not as interesting to random people if that makes sense. But positions hands down is one of my fav albums
1565,2020-11-09 20:41:53,jqrqml,"i mean, sales are dead but positions was handled terribly. the fact that it got leaked was bad, the album cover was lazy and the album as a whole was lacking in quality, sorry. i know it’s covid but the promo was horrible too. she could have done something more like idk, a livestream."
1566,2020-11-09 05:38:39,jqrqml,Bundles rule
1567,2020-11-09 05:37:07,jqrqml,"it is interesting. i personally loved the album as well (it’s my favorite one overall!), but I think the GP was probably expecting something on the same level as TUN. i assume because it was so iconic and even people who weren’t ariana grande fans had heard about it. that being said i’m so glad she went with her heart and made an album like this instead of playing it safe"
1568,2020-11-09 08:44:59,jqrqml,"Bundles such as signed cd's and any other additional items Included in the album total sales such as the alternative album covers were not included in the total sales. Positions has the highest one-week total for an album since bundles stopped factoring into chart and sales rankings. however, the new bundle rule came into place last month and not many huge artists on Ariana's level have released since then so that's not saying much lol. 

I do think the reasoning for low sales is becaue she played it very safe. The production and lyrics in tun were very impressive, however for positions they were mediocre and no songs really had a wow factor like most did in tun. 

Also the album leaked 4 days before the release date and almost everyone had already listened to the album and that would have had a big effect on the total sales.

Also it's worth noting positions had more first week streams that all her other albums bar tun (obviously lol). I believe we are in the streaming era and more people are streaming on platforms like Spotify and apple music rather than actually buying an album. Ariana is definitely a streaming artist and not an album seller. This could also be down to the fact the majority of her fans are from the current generation. Someone like Adele would have big pure album sales but maybe not as high pure streaming sales becaue her fans are from the older generation."
1569,2020-11-09 12:41:48,jqrqml,She should have prepped tons of bundles like signed CDs or even vinyl etc
1570,2020-11-09 15:50:38,jqrqml,"The pure sales is obvious. 

Streaming wise, I’d say a combo of the lead single not immediately sticking the landing for *a lot* of people, plus - that’s right - the whole thing leaked almost a week in advance, and *a lot* of people listened to it. 

I’m tempted to say over saturation played a role too, but her tweet got over a million likes, almost a million retweets etc. Seems to me like enough people didn’t care for the lead and skipped the album altogether. 

Who knowssssss exactly why tho"
1571,2020-11-09 05:46:52,jqrqml,I blame Scooter
1572,2020-11-09 07:27:41,jqrqml,"You're right. I think both worked as promo tactics. Ari using two weeks and a single as promo, Taylor using dropping the album in less than a day as promo. Each of them did their part of doing promo. But the success of their projects varied drastically. 

Hmm, but compared to Ari's past albums, she sold 300k for TUN and 200k for Swt. 100k is a big difference from 300k. It's practically half of what her last album did. She's lower than DW numbers back in 2016 when she's at the top of the game now. 100k to 300k is a huge range. 

I agree that My Hair is jazzy and unlike what she's done before. I enjoyed that. Yet the fact that most reviews feel like she's playing safe does indicate that she hasn't progressed much creatively. 

To me, I think progress is overrated. I dont mind if she dabbles the same genres over and over again as long as the music continues to sound good. I don't care much for evolution as long as the quality stays, but I guess the GP does."
1573,2020-12-11 10:17:49,jqrqml,"To be fair, Taylor's had big sales for years. She's always been more of an album artist, whereas Ariana is a singles artist"
1574,2020-11-09 11:38:04,jqrqml,"I absolutely agree. I think I've mentioned it before on other posts but it's sad that an artist's relevancy is tied to an extent to a tumultuous personal life. With a greater downfall comes greater highs and greater investment from the GP. 

I hate grief porn but I think a lot of the fanbase is guilty of that even though I know they don't have any ill intentions. I try my best not to indulge myself in that, which means I always ignore any possible references to Mac in her music. I don't care to know or discover it. I'd much rather let him rest in peace and enjoy her music for what it is."
1575,2020-11-09 20:50:56,jqrqml,"I’m sorry but reducing Taylor’s strength in album sales to just being about scooter and the label stuff seems extremely wrong. Especially folklore is a critically acclaimed album that took people by surprised and the fact that we didn’t even know she was referencing those things until we heard the album close enough (I certainly wasn’t expecting her to sing about it and also those things were referenced only in like 2 songs at best). The reason why Taylor has strong album sales AND streaming numbers wasn’t because people were interested in her personal life. She literally said folklore isn’t about her personal life (although you can make some connections about her personal life). Again, reducing Taylor’s hard work and taking a risk to switch from a pretty poppy album like reputation and lover to a more subdued album like folklore seems insulting. Of course maybe that’s not what you meant but the idea is; you make good music, people will listen to it, it doesn’t matter if some big event happened in the artist’s life or not."
1576,2020-11-09 05:45:00,jqrqml,Ariana did do signed CDs if I'm not wrong
1577,2020-11-09 05:42:09,jqrqml,"That's an interesting take. I agree that they expected TUN level of quality, and didn't get that. 

But the funny thing is, a lot of reviews say that she's playing it too safe in Positions. For example, I found this here:

https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/08/ariana-grande-positions-review"
1578,2020-11-09 08:53:36,jqrqml,"I see. That was an interesting and insightful take. I agree with many of your points. Thank you for sharing!!

(And omg I remember the leak now. That's probably one good reason.)"
1579,2020-11-09 15:51:39,jqrqml,Can’t do that anymore unless everything is ready to ship on release week.
1580,2020-11-09 15:54:16,jqrqml,"Yeah, you're right, I keep forgetting about the leaks. That played a part too, for sure. :(

Yeah, I went to popheads and a lot of people were confused how her Tweet announcing the album got a million likes but her album sales didn't exactly match that. Beats me too"
1581,2020-11-09 05:51:47,jqrqml,Why? Why do we have to blame her manager instead of holding the artist herself accountable to a degree? I don't want to blindly idolize someone to the point that I'd always push the blame to somebody else
1582,2020-11-09 15:08:37,jqrqml,"Hmm I think there were a whole bunch of reasons for one Taylor was able to use merch bundles before the rule came into effect that they wouldn’t count as sales, also the fact Ariana’s album leaked days before it dropped, then it being election week she wasn’t really posting much about it either, also I think if she had dropped another video to go with the album release that would’ve helped alot, but I would say Ariana’s release was a lot more messy then Folklore’s release, for me the music was great but the rollout was awful and idk what Scooter was thinking with this..."
1583,2020-11-09 05:50:40,jqrqml,"ehh she didn’t even signed a lot, and taylor’s album dropped right before the rule was set there was a bunch of different versions of her album on release and ariana didn’t even have a preorder link for this album as well. Billboard also said this was the highest one week total since the bundles stopped, so this low number was expected for me."
1584,2020-11-09 05:55:32,jqrqml,"Imo she did play it safe. She made an album in which she slightly departed from her usual stuff but still managed to sound like a bunch of music that could have effortlessly fit in previous projects. It obviously wasn't bad, but even some of her most devoted fans can recognize that it wasn't something fresh"
1585,2020-11-09 05:45:31,jqrqml,ooh yeah I actually can see that point as well! I guess I assumed a more typical pop sound would be considered “safe” but reading that I definitely can see their point!
1586,2020-11-09 15:53:22,jqrqml,That was my point
1587,2020-11-09 08:23:30,jqrqml,Lol it's always when an artist does bad blame the management but when an artist does good all credit to the artist
1588,2020-11-09 05:56:30,jqrqml,"You may be right, but you're indicating that this lack of a merch bundle option accounted for about 200k worth of difference of sales compared to TUN, or 600k difference in sales from Folklore? Taylor had an edge with the merch bundles, yes, but Ari had two weeks of hype to build before the album release, and Taylor had less than a day. Ari also had a single out a week before.

While it might explain Ari's drop in sales, this huge decline cannot be attributed fully to that."
1589,2020-11-09 17:26:02,jqrqml,"Oof my bad, missed “prepped.” Got you."
1590,2020-11-09 08:24:11,jqrqml,Agree lmao
1591,2020-11-09 06:01:34,jqrqml,"Your right on that one because many thought this would have been another thank u next, but obviously it wasn’t. But Taylor is one of those artists where she always does well when it comes to album sales, nothing like ariana so I wouldn’t use her as an example since she will always come on top."
1592,2020-11-09 12:59:20,jqrqml,"in all fairness, sales are literally her manager's job. blaming scooter for the music being crap is unfair, blaming scooter for the sales being low is more justified. as a whole though, people do demonise scooter a lot."
1593,2020-11-09 06:06:25,jqrqml,"Yes, it definitely wasn't TUN level. I agree with you.

Hmm, I believe that credit should be given when credit is due. Lover didn't do that well for Taylor's standards even though Taylor went ham with promoting it, but Folklore almost matched Lover in sales even though she barely did promo. Not even Taylor is infallible. If your album is good, it'll do well. That was the case for Folklore.

But Positions fell hard from TUN in terms of sales. If we're comparing Ari with her past works, it's not good either."
1594,2020-11-09 13:01:11,jqrqml,Sales can be low because music is crap though. I don't think Positions is crap (FAR FROM IT) but musical quality plays a massive role in sales.
1595,2020-11-09 06:11:47,jqrqml,"But it’s like why compare her old numbers when u can just enjoy what she got now 😭, of course it’s not gonna do similar numbers if people don’t like it. At the end she’s still number 1 whether the numbers were high or low."
1596,2020-11-09 13:12:19,jqrqml,"oh yeah for sure, but imo sales have a lot more to do with promotion and strategy. a lot of crap albums have sold loads of copies because of a few good singles and strong marketing. i'm just saying this is one area where it's not entirely unreasonable to assign some responsibility to her manager."
1597,2020-11-09 06:15:56,jqrqml,"Hmm, because I am interested in what the GP thinks of her works. As a fan I'm super biased towards her stuff so I always find it great, but I don't want to just stay in my biased bubble. I want to hear perspectives that might clash with my own. It helps me look at her works with new perspectives and thoughts"
1598,2020-11-09 13:34:12,jqrqml,"I think Scooter would have wanted Ari to do more promo, but she probably didn't want to. She's much less invested in charts than he is, or has at least indicated so during interviews. I don't think we should really point fingers at him because an artist as big as Ari probably has her own agency that he can't do much about."

Sorry if this seems like a lot, but character's possible musical interests is a topic that for some reason I immensely enjoy discussing and this can even help me get into an artist/band in some cases."
1622,2020-12-15 16:01:57,kdjk5e,Man imagine The Rockers listen to Ariana Grande
1623,2020-12-15 12:57:09,kdjk5e,"yeah I wasn't really thinking with that one, I should've put them in the doesn't listen to Ariana tier."
1624,2020-12-15 13:12:31,kdjk5e,"I feel like Dave would like Popular song. Ella and Dawn would love daydreaming and honeymoon avenue. DJ would like almost is never enough. And honestly I dont know which specific song Dave would like the most, i feel like he would like the overall vibe of this album the best.

Owen and the Surfer dudes would like all the hit songs from my everything, such as Bang bang, Problem, break free etc so they can play it at parties.

Courtney would like Bad decisions as she would heavily relate to it. Trent would constantly say that dangerous woman is Ariana's best album and his fave would be thinking bout you. Izzy wouldn't really have any favourites but would listen to Dangerous woman the most.

Zoey and Sammy seem like they would like No tears left to cry, everytime and breathin. Beardo and Harold would love the experimental sound of the album and the new direction Ariana takes. Their favourites would be the light is coming.

Anne Maria would probably just say thank u next is her favourite because of how successful it was, and her favourite would be thank u next. Leshawna would vibe to 7 rings a lot. Gwen would like Ghostin and In my head. Sam honestly idk.

Dakota would like positions because it's Ariana's newest album and she wants to follow the trends, her favourite song would be POV because she relates to it. Kitty would listen to POV because of tik tok. The rockers, Idk why i put them on there tbh i had a brainfart moment lmao, although maybe Ariana could be a guilty pleasure? Idk

&#x200B;

and dont worry about the long list, its cool."
1625,2020-12-15 13:16:32,kdjk5e,"Solid picks!! And out of the songs I know, they all seem pretty fitting! I'll probably have to check em out soon.

And thanks very much for the reply!!"
1626,2020-12-15 10:27:25,kdilq9,30+ is a pretty big collection
1627,2020-12-15 11:51:35,kdilq9,"Hi! My girlfriend has a very similar collection of perfumes. Of those that i don't see in your list, she has: Sì Eau de Parfum (not intense)  
Velvet Orchid Edp  Tom Ford   
For Her ea de Toilette  Narciso Rodriguez   
Coco Noir Eau de Parfum by Chanel  
Have you tried these  perfumes and what do you think of them?  
And can you share the perfumes that you have on your shelf that you definitely don't like?"
1628,2020-12-15 14:23:51,kdilq9,"You’d probably like Love, Don’t be Shy by Kilian, or maybe Moonlight in Heaven by Kilian.

Also Lolita Lempicka EDP is a classic. Guerlain La Petite Robe Noire as well. 

Interesting that you say you don’t like anything floral... a majority of the ones you have listed are florals.

Also, not knocking it, but thirty is a lot of perfumes!"
1629,2020-12-15 18:12:53,kdilq9,"Hanae Mori Butterfly would be my first suggestion to you.  It seems to fit into your wheelhouse.  Angel by Mugler would also fit neatly into your collection.  A few others to consider include:

Must de Cartier by Cartier

Shalimar by Guerlain

Mon Guerlain by Guerlain

Ombre Rose by Jean Jacques Brousseau

Amor Amor by Cacharel

Alien Fusion by Mugler"

1634,2020-12-15 14:30:08,kdilq9,"Yeah, like Lazy Sunday Morning. Haha but I don’t really pick up florals from these. Thanks for your suggestions! Will check them out. I’m bored with what I own 😅"

1638,2020-12-15 13:17:35,kdilq9,"And, just for interest. What you think about Shalimar and Guerlain perfumes in general?"
1639,2020-12-15 13:23:51,kdilq9,Never tried Shalimar but Guerlain perfumes are eh.. I don’t know what it is but I never got around to liking any from Guerlain :(

1650,2020-12-15 09:18:24,kdhcxh,She was getting fucked in every position when she came up with the idea
1651,2020-12-15 15:22:06,kdhcxh,"I’m convinced her handlers starve her of cock, deprive her of cum for these videos. She’s always so thirsty and willing"
1652,2020-12-15 11:28:01,kdhcxh,Thanks to the producing team to give her that nice idea and inspiration
1653,2020-12-15 07:39:27,kdh7u9,"Sex sells, women relate to women, some of them are attracted to women."
1654,2020-12-15 07:40:17,kdh7u9,Woman are way more comfortable with their sexuality than man because it doesn’t come with the same masculine social baggage that being a guy comes with. I mean I guess I shouldn’t say they are more comfortable but there is a less of an imposition on woman being straight then there is on men in our society. Kind of disgusting.
1655,2020-12-15 11:31:50,kdh7u9,Women can be gay. Seemingly groundbreaking for this question but I am a bisexual woman. We exist.
1656,2020-12-15 11:34:34,kdh7u9,"Also, if I see a woman being powerful, confident etc, I live vicariously for a minute, that energy is shared. It isn’t all sexual."
1657,2020-12-15 07:38:23,kdh7u9,The problem is in your question. Straight men rarely listen to Pop at all.
1658,2020-12-15 07:42:40,kdh7u9,"I really don't think that's the only factor here. Even if society was totally for it, I'd have 0 interest in watching male strippers, or men singing seductively about their bodies into a microphone, most straight men wouldn't. Yet straight women very much enjoy looking at attractive women, there's a big difference there which seems to be more biological than societal."
1659,2020-12-15 12:53:31,kdh7u9,Duh? But it's safe to say most of these artists audiences aren't gay.
1660,2020-12-15 07:55:30,kdh7u9,"Woman have better ability to contort their body or make it seem as so since they tend to be more flexible. As it goes for you saying most straight men wouldn’t, of course not. It’d be seen as super gay and a straight guy can’t have that marring his ego. Obviously a straight guy isn’t going to want a lap dance from another dude. So you kinda proven that it’s mostly societal. We also have to understand that all things society, especially sex, strongly relate back to our biology, so your answer to your own question can’t be wrong."
1661,2020-12-15 12:54:41,kdh7u9,How so? Very strange and bold claim to make when there’s no way for you to determine these statistics.
1662,2020-12-15 13:08:33,kdh7u9,"Simple math? Given the sheer number of fans they have and the small % of gay women it's very unlikely that the majority of their fans are gay. Again, that would beg the question why gay male artists don't attract similar crowds, quite the opposite, gay men tend to be really into these female artists as well."
1663,2020-12-15 13:14:09,kdh7u9,"Small % of gay women in statistical reports****. There’s such thing as dark figures, people do not rush to out themselves, it’s not safe. Additionally bisexual women don’t instantly realise they’re bisexual, it’s very normalised to be complimentary or other women and admire them which is why they get confused. Also just because people are a ‘minority’, doesn’t mean an artist can’t appeal more to them overall and therefore they make up most of the audience. Like I said in my other reply, it’s not all sexual, these women empower other women, their energy and confidence is empowering so that’s why women listen to them? It appeals to them directly, reflecting who they want to be. It’s similar to people listening to rappers who reference how rich they are, even though they’re not rich themselves. You get to live vicariously."

1687,2020-12-15 08:00:36,kde22w,"It was a bombing at the concert. Terrorism isn't one single thing and neither is Europe, where the terrorists cause is something you can negotiate on there's somewhere to go e.g. Irish or Basque independence and work can be done to bring moderates to the negotiating table while using intelligence to stop attacks.  Islamic terrorism in the Isis/Al Qaeda mode can't be negotiated with, they want a global Islamic caliphate, it's not like you can make an opening offer of giving them Llandudno. 

Likewise the issues motivating people to attack countries vary even within those terrorist groupings - there the French issue of Lacite which gave us the Paty and Charlie Hebdo attacks, Britain's involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan and so on.

The wars in the Middle East were either a just war poorly executed (Afghanistan) or a stupid war even more poorly executed (Iraq)."
1688,2020-12-15 06:47:18,kde22w,"Firstly, terrorism in the UK comes from various sources - Irish Republicans (by far the most common, although they don't kill people in large numbers anymore - hardly a week goes by without a bomb scare in Northern Ireland), the Far Right (there haven't been any major Far Right attacks since the assassination of a member of parliament four years ago, but the risk of a New Zealand or Norway-style attack is ever present) and radical Islamism (we have a couple of attacks per year, the most serious in recent years being the Manchester arena bombing in 2017).

As regards the latter problem which seems to be the one that interests you, based on your mention of the Middle East, it seems to me we need to crack down on extremist preachers and online radicalisation. It might also help to increase mental health support, and make sure it includes asylum seekers, who often slip through the cracks in our social welfare net.

And as regards our foreign policy, I do think we should stop invading other countries. It's done more harm than good to our security. Whilst there's no excuse for attacking innocent people, the 'war on terror' has legitimised many radicals in the eyes of their communities, because they see it as a war on Muslims. We need to do some serious community relations work and reduce the level of isolation from mainstream society that many British Muslims seem to experience."
1689,2020-12-15 11:53:31,kde22w,"Terrorism will never stop there are always people who are disillusioned.

And they blame other People for there problems be it race / religion / colour / Tribe"
1690,2020-12-15 06:24:14,kde22w,"Perhaps we could stop bombing the crap out of their countries / stop selling weapons to countries who bomb them. 

Fear is a powerful tool to radicalise people. Just look at nazi Germany or even recent america, where Trump built essentially a cult based on notion that immigrants were stealing their way of life (despite evidence to the contrary). Same for brexit, where immigrants were cast as the reason people are poor, completely overlooking the fact that the immigrants had less money than brexiters and in fact billionaires hoarding money and poor worker protection is the reason they have no money. 

Now imagine being a young person in a country being bombed or sanctioned heavily (such as Iran), whilst countries like Saudi, do what they like with impunity. Seems like radicalising them would be super easy."

1692,2020-12-15 18:08:01,kde22w,"You won't stop it, the price we pay for free society is occasionally some idiot makes it through and does something bad.

Perhaps what's needed is for people to realise that terrorism never works - but countries and the media have to keep demonstrating that by not over-reacting, not getting drawn in into things, not giving the perpetrators the attention or reactions they seek.

A story that stuck with me was from Martin McGuinness (involved with the IRA), when asked what made him change his mind and join the peace process he said (I'm paraphrasing badly):

&#x200B;

>A British army general had been interviewed in the media and admitted they didn't know how or if it was possible to beat the IRA, which caused celebration from our side - but then I realised we had the same problem, we could never actually beat the British army either.

&#x200B;

I'm sure I've read that the end-game of the various Muslim extremist groups is an actual holy war against the infidels, which they are basically trying to provoke with their terror attacks - so playing into their hands by retaliating, starting an unwinnable war and coincidentally killing a load of civilians along the way / radicalising previously peaceful folks by invading their country is potentially the opposite of helpful."

1702,2020-12-15 08:43:43,kde22w,People want to restrict immigration because of jobs and housing etc not because of terrorism. The majority of radicalised people tend to be second or third generation British and struggling to find an identity between their parents home and their new country.
1703,2020-12-15 09:31:09,kde22w,Most of the attacks here by Isis/Al Qaeda were second or third generation immigrants. Sure there are people who want to restrict immigration from majority Muslim countries and terrorism is used as a dog whistle for those folk.
1704,2020-12-15 08:39:10,kde22w,"Mental health support really is critical, I think. There's a very obvious mental health crisis in the UK right now, one which predates corona and has only got worse since. It seems it's not restricted to the UK either. Mentally ill people are more often than not the victims of violence and not the perpetrators, but there have been several instances of attacks by foreign nationals with severe mental health problems in the UK and other countries lately, and it seems to me things like that they can be addressed comparatively easily, when compared with chronic community issues such as alienation and radicalisation."
1705,2020-12-15 15:34:20,kde22w,"Most historians of the Islamic State agree that the group emerged out of al-Qaeda in Iraq as a response to the U.S. invasion in 2003. They also agree that it was shaped primarily by a Jordanian jihadist and the eventual head of al-Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The Jordanian had a dark vision: He wished to fuel a civil war between Sunnis and Shiites and establish a caliphate. Although he was killed in 2006, his vision was realized in 2014—the year isis overran northern Iraq and eastern Syria.

They also agree that it was shaped primarily by a Jordanian jihadist and the eventual head of al-Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The Jordanian had a dark vision: He wished to fuel a civil war between Sunnis and Shiites and establish a caliphate. Although he was killed in 2006, his vision was realized in 2014—the year isis overran northern Iraq and eastern Syria.’"

Then, I’d flip her over and fuck her tight ass doggystyle, pulling on that long hair as I pound her until I flood her ass with cum. Next, I’d make her slowly worship my cock, kissing, licking and sucking my shaft as she tastes my cum and her own ass until I’m fully erect again. To make sure I’m rock hard, she squeezes her perky tits together and jerks me off until she feels it throbbing. Finally, I’d put her back on the bed and spread those tanned legs before giving her the best fucking of her life, fucking her pussy until her eyes roll into the back of her head and I’ve impregnated her."
