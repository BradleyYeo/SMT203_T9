7,2020-01-27 10:20:25,eul841,"> As such, I have faith that they'll make the next Saints Row game be ***the best*** in the series if not second best next to Saints Row 2.

If the next Saints Row turned out not to be ***the best*** but decent enough, do you think people will be disappointed and make it out to be worse than it actually is?"
8,2020-01-30 12:11:32,eul841,Very well thought out review. Unfortunately it doesn’t belong on the Saints Row subreddit. Please check out r/aomthegame. Thanks.
9,2020-01-27 18:46:56,eul841,"Its hard to know what to be optimistic for, because we don't know if SRV will carry over AOM's issues in it. I mean the humor in AOM for me was just really cringy with the stiff voice acting, Hollywood's meme jokes and the writing in the overall game being pretty shallow. A generic plot and really generic, forgettable characters. AOM seemed to hammer home where SR was originally going to go and it was not what I would consider to be Volition's best. The game definitely has its highs and lows.

SRV could be the best, but that is hard to define. We'd like it if they listened to the fans of the originals and took suggestions, but there is the other end of the fandom that doesn't really care about anything so long as what they get is eye catching and has a lot of energy to it. Which doesn't take a lot of thought. Volition also isn't known to take much seriously. Even criticism.

From my impression of AOM the gameplay might be too messy and unbalanced for SR's simpler chaotic gun play, if they carried any of it over. I dn't know. I do like AOM's graphical style though. Most people here wouldn't agree but I always thought AOM looked like a much much smoother look on SRTT's rough looking models. Everything in AOM looks very smooth and the environments seem to have the better balance of cartoony and semi-realistic that they could be going for.  

I didn't play AOM so I don't know what I could really say about it outside of just small details I can compare to SR. There is a lot of character dialogue as mentioned between all the agents, which is a lot more than what SR does, and I would like them to do that in SR.  Some details I do like is that AOM showed us that Gat is Korean, and we also learn that Kinzie is from Louisiana. Something about them being from real world places before they came to Stilwater/Steelport just seems cool to me."

Most people that have it will have mild symptoms and can recover at home just fine.  Hospitals are being reserved for people with extreme cases or other complicating factors, like pneumonia or something like that.
my brother is a nurse anesthetist and his hospital is sending people home if they test positive but have no problems breathing.  They are reserving beds for people who are experiencing respiratory problems."

35,2020-03-23 23:37:08,fnrtxy,anyone else find it sad that there are so many people out there that value the opinion of celebrities so much more than doctors that actual celebrities had to come out and make videos telling people to listen to their doctors?
36,2020-03-23 23:58:25,fnrtxy,"
> I was lucky enough to start taking these drugs before my fever got severe and my temperature started to rise.

It must be nice. I developed a 102 fever and immediately called my doctor and they told me to take Ibuprofen and see if it goes down. I  spoke with them every day and they said only come in if it goes to 104. They refused to test me because I hadn't traveled. Luckily my fever went down after 4 days at 102 and I feel great now, despite being a little weak. My doctor also later called me to tell me to not take Ibuprofen because covid19 might cause issues with it but there are no studies out regarding this yet.

This celeb guy got tested and treated with a cocktail of drugs that has him feeling great. I had to sit on the couch feeling like I was dying for 4 days straight with water and Ibuprofen."
37,2020-03-23 23:39:37,fnrtxy,"Ah man I was with you until you started suggesting medicine. Yes you do give a disclaimer but people listen to celebrities, more perhaps then to Politicians, and so what you say carries weight. It’s so, so, important to follow the proper guidelines set by doctors and if they have not yet clinically tested something for a specific purpose then it won’t be safe for the general population to take. 

Let’s listen to the scientists. I think that’s one takeaway from this whole shit show."
38,2020-03-23 23:36:30,fnrtxy,better than his ending in Andromeda Strain

53,2020-03-24 01:40:05,fnrtxy,">Yes you do give a disclaimer but people listen to celebrities

its their choice then, he clearly says hes no professional, and this is what worked for him, but you should prioritize expert opinions, not by those exact words but the message is there and is very clear.

i know its a radical analogy, but, if i tell someone to not/shouldnt jump off a bridge (not as suicide, but like a dive) but they do anyways, because i once jumped and i was fine, and end up really hurt or dying, would i be responsible for that? i ultimately agree with you but he cant be held accountable for the actions of others when he makes a disclaimer himself, hes simply giving what people asked, which is an account of his personal experience, if peopleignore his disclaimer and follow blindly its on them."

63,2020-03-24 03:21:24,fnrtxy,This is such a straw man analogy I can’t even respond
64,2020-03-24 09:00:53,fnrtxy,"Exactly.  In most European countries that I known of there is a two tiered healthcare system.  Rich people can and do receive better care, if they get private insurance on top of their mandatory state insurance.  There are private hospitals that only cater to the rich throughout Europe."

67,2020-03-24 04:11:52,fnrtxy,"how so? you imply that its irresponsible of him to say that, does that not suggest that if someone was to take his word as an absolute it would be on him?

maybe its not the best analogy, i do give you that, but i think deep down it gets the point across, one cannot be responsible for the actions of others, unless said person is actively being manipulative in nature.

if im still misinterpreting your ultimate message, i would appreciate at least a clarification, otherwise i take your attitude as just not wanting to counter argument.

(im not trying to start a war here, my intentions are of legitimate discussion.)"
68,2020-03-24 06:03:00,fnrtxy,"Because jumping off a bridge is not analogous to taking the medication mentioned in the video.

The correct analogy would be a celebrity (not you, because that would be an incorrect analogy) tells his/her followers that jumping from a small height cured his thingy-magigy that was hurting. Disclaimer! He/she is not a doctor. The Doctors say there is some anecdotal evidence that it could help some people but they aren’t yet sure on the full risk assessment. 

The danger with the above message is that people that admire or follow that celebrity might just take the anecdotal evidence rather than looking into the actual advice and science. 

Your argument is just, ‘well that’s their problem’. My argument is ‘that’s now also the celebrity’s problem’ because they shouldn’t be spreading information that they aren’t experts on. 

There isn’t really a middle ground. You think ‘stupid’ people deserve what comes to them. I think we all have a responsibility in the way that we share information."

People who used the drug for its purpose likely had tons and tons of different makeups and genetics and conditions, so looking at the safety of the drug right now, before applying if it can eradicate covid, is accurate as fuck.

Hydrochloroquine has been around since the 1940s.  

It has been taken by millions.  

Tens of millions of doses are being donated by a few pharmaceutical firms by the end of the month to prevent a shortage.

It has been tested and  ""virologically"" cured 100% of infected COVID-19 patients

106,2020-03-23 22:28:12,fnn7xk,"Re: all the backlash. What exactly is the heuristic we ought to have here? Are we holding out for full fledged pre and post-market research and months to years of fleshed out RCTs before it becomes acceptable to suggest that maybe HCQ is useful here? Doesn’t this defeat the purpose of even attempting to respond in a timely manner to the pandemic?

People did not pull HCQ and ZPack out of their asses here. This isn’t prescribing Propecia and Viagra for COVID-19. There is a plausible mechanism as well as in vitro data and preliminary clinical data supporting at minimum conservative use of this cocktail. Fuck, the attitude of this subreddit seems to waver back and forth based on the context of the testimonial. You can always say “yes but in vitro isn’t as good as an RCT” and that’s true in principle, but we can’t have perfect formal RCT data and also respond to this pandemic in a way that matters. That scenario just doesn’t exist. 

[The CDC at least does not discourage its use and relays some of the common dosing regimens that are being used, which can be seen as tacitly suggesting cautious use of it](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/therapeutic-options.html) and [a Johns Hopkins expert has already](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marybethpfeiffer/2020/03/22/one-patient-dodges-a-covid-bullet-is-she-a-harbinger-or-outlier/)  backed up essentially what most of us who are optimistic about this drug combo have said (and I can go find many more credible sources pushing cautious optimism, but those are just two that stood out):

“Despite the limitations of this study, in the absence of any effective treatment, in this urgent situation, this Plaquenil and Azithromycin combination therapy should be given to patients with COVID-19 as a treatment option,” Ying Zhang, a professor of microbiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, wrote in an email. “For now, there is no time to wait.”

It’s really hard for me to not feel as though this backlash is primarily fueled by the unfortunate fact that Trump had to open his dumb mouth about HCQ and Z Pack. Which is not a good thing. People say “follow the science” but I’m seeing less of that and more just blind naysaying here."
107,2020-03-23 17:32:18,fnn7xk,"People blame Trump for not doing enough.  He pushes for treatment and those same people want it locked up in a lab for years.

Whatever position Trump takes, the left wants the opposite.  They don't have answers, just do the opposite of what Trump wants so they can blame him.  These people could care less about the well being of the planet as long as they can blame Trump for it.

That is the TRUTH.  Guess what?  More and more people see through your hatred every day and are seeing the truth come out."

My mom has rheumatoid arthritis, is over 60, overweight and has hypertension. She isnt exactly the the model of perfect health. I cant imagine what could possibly put her LESS at risk than me (overweight, but not obese).

220,2020-03-23 23:38:33,fnn7xk,"No. It is the fact that the HCQ discussion in America is not and never even started as a discussion about effectiveness.

It started as a right wing conspiracy theory that the left wing media was hiding the cure in order to bring down the economy.

The discussion then became people trying to explain why the media was not talking about a “cure” yet; namely that, at the time, there was one essentially anecdotal 24 person study that suggested it might be effective. 

Then Trump picked up on the right wing blogosphere talking points and started repeating them in his tweets and statements. He also pressured his administration to start handing it out.

When the experts explained to him that there needed to be further study and that the studies had already begun he still kept talking about it as though it is a treatment he feels very positive about and essentially acted like it was being “delayed” by the bureaucrats  and deep state.

Now the right wing blogosphere is continuing their conspiracy tirade and adding to it that the deep state is suppressing a vaccine.

So when we have some asshat say, without any evidence other than his anecdotal experience, that it was a miracle cure it pisses people off. He has no idea how his recovery would have progressed without it.

This should never have become politicized, but it is now, and every fuckwit trying to say this is the cure and we need to start handing it out is responding to political agenda whether that know it or not.

The experts are going to do their process, as fast as they can, cutting as many corners as they feel they can given the administration pressure to do so.

It is already being given off label.

So those on reddit pressuring for this to be handed out or arguing that it is effective should ALL shut the fuck up. They are promoting an entirely political narrative whether they realize it or not.

The unbiased, professional narrative, being expressed by the experts is THAT WE NEED TO STUDY IT AND PROCEED PRUDENTLY.

That is why the left arguing exactly that are not the ones being political. 


Hell, the right is not trying to our DR Fauci as a pro Clinton political hack ENTIRELY as part of their trying to prop up theor deep state conspiracy to shift blame for the poor and slow response off of Trump and onto a deep state who is trying to undermine him.

There is an increasing chance Trump will replace Fauci because of dipshits promoting this fucking conspiracy theory that HCQ is being suppressed.


I have been on this sub for several weeks. When it had less than 100k members and they were mostly not Americans. This discussion of HCQ then was a discussion about effectiveness. Now all it is a bunch of bullshit.

Just wait for the god damn studies to be conducted and stop downvoting people who think we should listen to the experts. Asshole."

“Depending on their clinical presentation azithromycin was added to the treatment.”

I’m sorry, are saying Azithromycin, an antibiotic used for everything from acne to STDs, is the problem in this study? Even though it is even considered safe for use while pregnant or breastfeeding?

But you’re happy that a crappy trial added an additional element to an already poor study using poorly defined clinical presentation.

And you’re happy with the result: “Azithromycin added to Hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination. “

Here’s a Wikipedia article for you: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azithromycin

You ask: “Do you understand how much more dangerous that one is over the other?”. And my answer is yes. I do.

Edit: holy fuck, I’ve just realized that you didn’t realize that the study that I referenced above is the one that started all this crap. This is the study that is supposed to show the effectiveness of Hydroxychloroquine! You’ve been arguing against the study that you think proves your point, you tepid little pustule."

There’s a real discussion about exactly how useful this will be for covid-19, but the safety profile isn’t part of that discussion. This is an old drug. We’re very familiar with it.

It seems as if you're smuggling this culpability for online conspiracy theorists and their nonsense into the conversation and onto people who are hopeful about HCQ, even if they aren't even aware of what it is you're talking about, and then scoring those as points for yourself. You really need to ask yourself if you don't have a totally unfalsifiable worldview here.

I never said anything about a conspiracy to keep HCQ off the shelves. I think most medical professionals are doing a good job fast tracking it right now. I'm arguing against *you* because I think your points are bad.

And with regards to what the experts are saying, you're not wrong that FDA clearance and/or approval requires more study, and ideally we'd have this as soon as possible. However, obtaining new indications for old drugs is a foot dragging process, and often no one bothers to do it. If your standard here is it must be FDA approved for this exact indication or else it's equivalent to witchcraft, that's not a standard a ton of drugs currently prescribed every single day are held to.

And it's not even true that experts [aren't recommending cautious use of it](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marybethpfeiffer/2020/03/22/one-patient-dodges-a-covid-bullet-is-she-a-harbinger-or-outlier/#24527155b843). The CDC even [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/therapeutic-options.html] outlines current dosing regmiens, mind you without explicitly condoning its use, but that reads as a tacit approval for cautious use to me."

Azithromycin is an antibiotic used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. This includes middle ear infections, strep throat, pneumonia, traveler's diarrhea, and certain other intestinal infections. It can also be used for a number of sexually transmitted infections, including chlamydia and gonorrhea infections. Along with other medications, it may also be used for malaria.

You’re not wrong that Trump is speaking out of turn about HCQ and Z pack, I agree he shares responsibility in this instance, but this shouldn’t be taken as an omen or prognostic that HCQ is a scam or “snake oil.” 

I have the opposite concern as someone who sees this as a potentially critical piece of fighting this pandemic that it is now just becoming “that drug that Trump talked about.” I mean you can see this immediately if you scan Reddit.

Ciência não é opinião, ciência não é sentimento, ciência não é relato e muito menos o fato de que se algo funciona em alguém então está comprovado. Estudo científico tem que ser randomizado, com centenas (ou milhares) de pessoas, com um grupo de controle e análise de resultados por cientistas. Qualquer outra coisa é crendice."

374,2020-04-04 15:14:31,furnd1,"I also think Matthew Fox is great. He definitely has a few scenes that aren’t great, but his best scenes are incredible (church scene in the finale, season 3 finale, etc)"
375,2020-04-04 11:07:41,furnd1,"I thought Mr Eko was good. I loved his story, I wish they done a mini series with him. I disliked Claire the most but I think that’s she’s just annoying rather than a bad actress."
376,2020-04-04 12:29:24,furnd1,"Interesting. Maybe it’s because I’m a fan of Jeremy Davies work, but I never thought of him as one of the worst actors. Always enjoyed him and his portrayal of Faraday. 

For me:

Best:

Michael Emerson as Ben

Terry O’Quinn as Locke/MiB

Elizabeth Mitchell as Juliet

Worst:

Michelle Rodriguez as Ana-Lucia

Bai Ling as Achura"
377,2020-04-04 18:15:18,furnd1,gotta have josh holloway as sawyer up there too as one of the best. he did a beautiful job as sawyer and throughout character development was great too. always love the scene where he confronts anthony cooper and kills him
378,2020-04-04 15:12:21,furnd1,I'm quite controversial in my thinking here. I don't think Michelle Rodriguez as Ana Lucia was bad acting - the character development and script were pretty poor for her part. I thought Dominic Page as Charlie was pretty rubbish -over acted most scenes.
379,2020-04-04 18:45:13,furnd1,"Favorites: Matthew Fox, Terry O'Quinn and Michael Emerson

Worst: the actress who played young Ellie and Zoe"
380,2020-04-05 11:37:17,furnd1,Don’t even care who the best is...worst is Michelle Rodriguez. Poorly developed character compounded by her typical exaggerated acting and played out “badass chick” role.
381,2020-04-04 22:56:31,furnd1,Well obviously the best is Matthew Fox but why do you think Maggie Grace was bad? Just because she played a ditzy annoying girl? The scene where she was having that panic attack was awesome. Her flashback with her dad dying was also really well done.
382,2020-04-04 22:18:30,furnd1,"not an easy task, but:

best: Michael Emerson, Terry O'Quinn, Evangeline Lilly, Jorge Garcia, Henry Ian Cusick

worst: Jeremy Davies, Ian Somerhalder"
383,2020-04-06 04:54:24,furnd1,"A lot of the acting is just totally amazing in this show so it’s hard to say one actor was better than another. I’m going to hand it to Terry O’Quinn for playing two entirely different characters and absolutely nailing both roles.

It’s easier to pin point the bad acting. Plenty of minor characters who were poor actors but most of the main cast were good. Michelle Rodriguez was fine but she was given terrible writing to work with. 

Im a little surprised that people think the actor for Faraday was bad. He seemed to fit the awkward scientist role very well.

Maggie Grace was the worst actress by a mile and in other roles she’s had I’ve felt similarly."
384,2020-04-05 00:04:40,furnd1,"Best: Ben, Locke, Jack, Vincent

Worst: Charlie, Achara"
385,2020-04-07 01:02:04,furnd1,"Best: Sawyer, Ben, Juliet, Des

Worst: Jack, Faraday, Charlie"
386,2020-04-05 13:03:27,furnd1,"They were all perfectly casted for their characters, 
Their journey began from A to Z
It was all penned out and it made sense for their story arcs but what I didn't like was that the MIB didn't get enough screen time as his character was portrayed by numerous actors: John Locke, Yemi, Christian Shepard and Alex"
387,2020-04-06 04:57:14,furnd1,Matthew Fox was outstanding and underrated. His performance in S6 was especially great.
388,2020-04-04 11:47:47,furnd1,"Love Mr Eko as well! He really sells a character that otherwise would be over the top.

Yeah, i agree about Claire. I think she sometimes is badly written."
389,2020-04-04 12:45:27,furnd1,Emerson and O’Quinn are must haves on best! Unfortunately i think Davies gets over the top a lot of the time
390,2020-04-05 06:20:42,furnd1,Totally agree with everything you said👍
391,2020-04-05 08:54:40,furnd1,Don’t agree at all. I like the character (adds fun conflict) but i can’t buy that its a real person based on her performance.
392,2020-04-05 08:56:23,furnd1,"But yeah, Fox is also great! Really lives the character. His best Work! Deserves recognition!"

They ended up skipping the second to last episode because they filmed a pandemic one before all this and decided it would be scary/in poor taste to air now. So they had Daniel and the main guy film a little blurb from their homes to explain, and they showed a few clips from that episode that introduced Daniel's character (it was his first episode). Was kinda cool to see how they changed it up on the fly. Apparently he caught it while filming the finale."

444,2020-04-22 19:33:48,g64toi,"Yeah, this is a feeling I started to get a year or two ago. I know what you mean. It started when Steve was having a reaction to the nuclear device in the truck. And then there would be little hints dropped along the way that Steve was getting older and was unable to keep up with bad guys. It's like Lenkov wanted to have an out in case contracts couldn't be finalized. But it definitely became more noticeable in season 10.   

As far as Kim and Park leaving, I was hoping that Lenkov would've stayed true to Five-0 canon and brought in new people named Truck and Ben. Oh well, it was a good ride."
445,2020-04-22 19:52:48,g64toi,Yeah as really missed Daniel and Grace and should had done something about it. After the outcry. Though liked Tani and Junior but they are no match for the cousins!
446,2020-04-23 03:34:51,g64toi,"I started  backwards,  with season 10, and  then  finished season 1 and half of season 2.

What I noticed is the first 30 episodes are full of special guest stars, whereas season 10 never had one.

Why so many familiar faces in the beginning?"
447,2020-04-22 20:19:19,g64toi,Any idea why is Scott away often ? Another series ?
448,2020-04-22 22:13:39,g64toi,"I think they wanted to be able to end the show if they got cancelled so they always had this subplot going, and it really picked up at the end of S10. It still felt a little rushed to me, and somewhat anti climactic but it was solid."
449,2020-04-22 22:28:39,g64toi,"That makes a lot of sense, I noticed that Steve also stopped doing such rigorous and demanding stunts. I also really wish there was more Kamekona this season. 

It’s such a shift from the last couple seasons, so much so that I don’t even want to watch the show anymore even though I’ve basically lived and breathed Hawaii 5-0 for the last month."
450,2020-04-24 07:13:24,g64toi,"You do it to sell the new show to the curious and build up traction in hopes of making it past the 5 year syndication threshold. 

“Oh, look Scott’s Dad is guest starring in this episode!”"
451,2020-04-22 23:09:10,g64toi,He apparently made an agreement at the beginning that he'd do about 4 less episodes a season than everyone else since he had other stuff going on.
452,2020-04-22 23:07:46,g64toi,"Yeah, it seemed like the past few years had some ideas planted here and there just in case they needed to end things."
453,2020-04-22 23:06:48,g64toi,"Kamekona must have some serious knee or leg issues because every time he's been on Five-0 or Magnum, he's been sitting down."
454,2020-04-22 23:18:12,g64toi,"I thought “Steve’s” was going to be the end, I was surprised when they gave up on that story line"
455,2020-04-23 00:36:15,g64toi,"Ha! I know, me too. Continuity wasn't a strong point in this show. There were quite a few things that kind of just fell by the wayside."
456,2020-06-20 05:23:24,hcfsxf,Idk ab the rock he looks too intimidating imo and Jiraiya doesn’t give off that feel. Jiraiya looks like a old man but is really one of the most powerful ninja out there. The rock could make a great raikage though

458,2020-06-17 22:59:30,hb262a,"Are you following me?! 

We're rewatching season 4 right now and just finished episode 11 last night. I've really been enjoying the break down. I forget how much I don't like Cordy and Connor (and jot just because Cordy AND Connor, if you know what I mean) but with the power of foresight I know how it pays off and it makes it all better. 

I also forgot how unlikeable they make Gunn this season as the jealous boyfriend. I'm in the thick of that plotline right now and am curious to remember how it all transitions because, again, I know what Season 5 has in store and I can't remember enough to connect the dots."
459,2020-06-18 02:11:42,hb262a,"Just try to keep in mind that Cordelia was possessed after ""Spin the Bottle."" So it wasn't really Cordy sleeping with Connor. I suppose the kiss in ""Supersymmetry"" was real though. Ugh.

Oh, yeah, I always assumed that Daniel Dae Kim left to do Lost, but I guess there was a gap there."
460,2020-06-18 06:39:14,hb262a,"I guess I am following you...with my Angel season 4 rewatch  of course, duh!

Strangely, when I first watched the season when I was in my teens, I did not mind Cordelia and Connor as much and was more focused on the plot. But nowadays, I shudder when they share a scene. It is just so gross.

&#x200B;

I agree, Gunn's jealousy of Wesley makes sense, but even when he first came onto the show, as a vampire hater he was never quite as relentlessly sullen."
461,2020-06-18 06:40:35,hb262a,"Yeah,  I think that makes it easier to accept the development of Cordy, but still ew. 

&#x200B;

Daniel Dae Kim started Lost in 2004, after Angel got cancelled, so sadly it was just the case of TPTB getting rid of their Wolfram and Hart characters."

Ming-na Wen is obviously perfect for June but I'd say that she's almost a boring choice. Like we've seen her do that kind of role before."
467,2020-06-10 12:37:51,h09pp2,Good choices!
468,2020-06-11 05:57:54,h09pp2,But then who would play General Fong?

470,2020-06-10 12:34:04,h09pp2,Fair point about Ming-na Wen. But when I think 'badass female Asian' she's at the top of the list.

474,2020-06-05 20:25:13,gx3q56,"The old guard for civil rights spoke up for all injustices, not just black ones. Muhammad Ali, MLK, and Malcolm X were well-read about white supremacy around the globe and were morally consistent. 

If you want to hear straight from the horse's mouth what black people think of asians today, go on black subs and black social media and watch what they say about asians. 

The point is, just because blacks leaders were pro-asian before does not mean they are pro-asian today, nothing more, nothing less. The fact that all the evidence people are using to convince black people have helped asians is 50 years old says something, doesn't it?"
475,2020-06-06 19:44:39,gx3q56,"I have to ask, are you middle class, upper class? To my understanding minority violence typically occurs in low income areas, so that may explain why you seen little violence in your area. Then again, I could be wrong. You are less likly to see a middle class person beating up and older person."
476,2020-06-06 01:06:12,gx3q56,"I am fortunate to live in a city where we all get along, I never even knew there was an asian vs black issue until I went online. Though there have been comments seen that made my blood boil, I’m smart enough to know there are many many blacks that are against this. I listed some black celebrities speaking out, are we going to be anti black because of a group of coward keyboard warriors? 

For example, a black councilman actually wanted to deny funds to Chinese restaurant owners but the other council members and so many people in Virginia (many whom are black) have commented that it’s so wrong. Hundreds and hundreds. I think for whatever reason it seems to be more of a geographical issue.

477,2020-06-06 20:31:15,gx3q56,"I’m middle class I guess but where I grew up and where my family’s business at I believe is working class. There’s a big mix of Africans, Jamaicans, blacks, Laotian, Cambodian, and Filipino. I wonder if it being Southeast asian has anything to do with being more integrated and mixed among couples and friends because we seem to have more in common. East Asians are up north in more of the middle upper class lol. Not too many blacks in that area. I’m Chinese, Filipino and Thai. Also, Columbus Ohio has a high murder rate but I haven’t seen anything about racial attacks."
478,2020-06-06 20:32:18,gx3q56,Hmm interesting SEA take.
479,2020-06-01 09:20:40,guh96r,"""Almost perfect... One hair out of place.""

Li and Lo have always been a fascinating pair of characters to me. Like, you almost get the sense that they're like Azula's two Auntie Irohs, but who *are* these women? Evidently they're at least prominent enough individuals to be entrusted with accompanying the Fire Nation Princess and even overseeing her Firebending training >!despite not being benders themselves!< but we never really got any proper backstory on them."
480,2020-06-01 10:34:37,guh96r,"You know, as much as General Fong is a deranged extremist, it's quite sweet that he went out of his way to individually welcome not just the three kids, but also Appa and even Momo. You didn't see Chief Arnook giving either of *them* a shoutout last season, that's for sure."
481,2020-06-01 10:41:48,guh96r,Iroh straight up grabbing Azula's hand when she's about to use lightning was absolutely badass.

483,2020-06-01 12:23:31,guh96r,Is no one gonna talk about how Iroh single-handedly defeated everyone on the ship including Azula?
484,2020-06-01 14:13:35,guh96r,"During the show's initial run, 10-year-old me was traumatized seeing Katara get buried alive. I still had Yue's death from the Book 1 finale fresh in my mind, and I had also just recently watched ""Revenge of the Sith"", so the entire *idea* of a significant character's death was fresh in my mind. Even though it was just an illusion and Katara was unharmed, it messed me up so bad that I just stopped watching apart from coming back for a couple episodes here and there. I finally watched the whole thing about 5 years ago when it was on Prime, and it really made me regret stopping back then.

Also, until >!Zuko alone,!< I totally thought Azula was older than Zuko. I was seriously shocked when I looked on the wiki and saw that she's the same age as Katara and >!Ty Lee.!< She is so much fun to watch because she's pretty much guaranteed to do or say something totally badass every time she shows up on the screen. Her very first dialogue *immediately* gives the show a much darker tone. Play time is **over**."
485,2020-06-01 13:07:23,guh96r,"Azulas intro is great. Such a fun villain to see.

Also great to have a downside to using the avatar state. Makes sense as to why Aang should not rely on it too much. Fun start to my favorite season of ATLA"
486,2020-06-01 10:01:05,guh96r,"First timer here.

* The parlor looks [just as beautiful as it is dangerous](https://i.imgur.com/ddPbLTi.png).
* So Azula uses [lightning-bending](https://i.imgur.com/FNtlYqI.png) to fight. Does this mean fire-benders have an inherent ability to bend lightning as well (if trained for it)? ~~We never saw her use actual fire-bending in this episode, which either means she can't or didn't think it would be useful here.~~ Edit: As pointed out by others she did fire-bend once with a blue flame, which would technically give her advantage since scientifically, blue flames are hotter than yellow / red ones.
* I didn't even recognize [Sokka there](https://i.imgur.com/kwQ8GnY.png). His resemblance to his sister is striking here.
* The concept of betrayal by their own was conveyed beautifully in this episode. The transitions between the Aang and Zuko's actions were on point.
* [That's the face of a man who just realized his terrible mistake](https://i.imgur.com/9OiApEf.png).
* The coordination of General Fong's men was incredible. It was such a tightly choreographed dance, playing on their collective strengths to take down foes much stronger than any individual.
* [That's the face of a man who just realized his terrible mistake](https://i.imgur.com/LTnLYiq.png) x 2.
* Our [favorite expositional character](https://i.imgur.com/1IcTUr8.png) returns. The double-edged nature of the Avatar-state is an interesting concept, and we now know how it can be triggered as well. I love how the [animators](https://i.imgur.com/hP9g5AA.png) keep the show [fresh](https://i.imgur.com/86ul9xs.png) even [when](https://i.imgur.com/ZDnB4fS.png) doing [exposition](https://i.imgur.com/JWR3YEz.png).
* We're finally headed to Omashu where the [true main character](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/2/2f/Cabbage_merchant.png/revision/latest?cb=20140112200908) awaits us.
* The [final scene](https://i.imgur.com/bqVlZCh.png) of this episode seems to be one of the more significant ones for Zuko. He may have very well decided to forgo his honor and live in true exile."
487,2020-06-01 13:28:24,guh96r,"They kinda gloss over the fact that Aang killed thousands of people at the North Pole.

I get that he wasn't really in control of his actions, but knowing Aang it seems like that would weigh on him more."
488,2020-06-01 16:22:54,guh96r,"Cutting the hair is more linked to Samurai cutting their top knot off than the Buddha.

https://jp.learnoutlive.com/drama-cutting-off-ones-hair-in-japan/

It was showing their drop in status from Royal family to fugitives."
489,2020-06-01 17:37:14,guh96r,"Poor Iroh trying to explain to Zuko that Ozai  doesn’t love him. It must be so hard to see the boy you consider a son choose his abuser over you. I can’t imagine the pain that would cause. Real question though: did Iroh go to support his nephew or to keep him safe? He knew going with Zuko would make his nephew happy, but I can’t help but wonder if part of the reasons he went was to protect Zuko from his family and ensure he wasn’t lost to their machinations forever.

I also really appreciate how this first episode mirrors >!the season finale, where Aang uses the avatar state and dies. I like that this episode is already planting the seeds of what happens here  with Azula’s lighting, the avatar state warning, and Katara not liking the avatar state. I have to wonder if thats another reason why Aang apologizes to her in the season finale, apart from the whole “he needs to detach from her” thing!<

Also fun fact: when Azula and Zuko fight you can hear (and see!) him lose his breath control right before Azula taunts him. Its a reminder that Zuko still isn’t a great firebender."
490,2020-06-01 10:59:52,guh96r,I’m glad they explained the Avatar State to start of the season. My biggest issue with the last season was how Aang would be in a situation where he clearly wasn’t trained enough and would just start glowing white and get bailed out
491,2020-06-02 02:45:05,guh96r,“i've decided to go to the south pole....it's time we helped rebuild our sister tribe” yeah right grampakku you just tryna smash now that you know you know your lady’s still alive
492,2020-06-01 10:31:37,guh96r,"It's still surreal to me that Netflix finally released the entire show in the US, especially since I literally JUST finished rewatching the whole thing on Netflix using a VPN like two months ago. Whelp, any excuse to re-watch the series *again* is fine by me."
493,2020-06-01 13:12:47,guh96r,I always thought that Azula and Zuko were twins when I was younger. It's still crazy to think she's only 14.
494,2020-06-01 16:47:00,guh96r,"Kind of weird that this is just about the only episode *ever* across both series to depict bleeding (when Azula scratches Zuko during their fight)... And even then, it disappears shortly afterwards."
495,2020-06-02 02:43:43,guh96r,"This episode premiered when I was like 10 so when the teaser came out of General Fong going “Aang you’re ready to face the fire lord now” and Aang being like (╬⁽⁽ ⁰ ⁾⁾ Д ⁽⁽ ⁰ ⁾⁾)  I straightup thought the general was hiding Ozai behind a curtain or some shit and the bell was about to go off for round 1

Also can we talk about Azula's theme cuz my queen is officially onboard!! Her sound is characterized by those ominous pitchy bells but what makes the actual melody so unsettling is that it starts out like a variation of the fire nation leitmotif with the fourth note omitted so you're kinda expecting that note but left hanging."
496,2020-06-01 16:17:37,guh96r,"this was the episode that lit the sparkle of my ever growing crush on azula, certainly a most badass lightning bender, 10/10 would nominate to replace the zeus dude"
497,2020-06-01 12:19:49,guh96r,"This episode is interesting because it shows how some powerful people will tend to control the avatar to their purposes, because the avatar, even with all that power, it's still a child.

Minor spoilers form Rise of Kyoshi >!It the same thing which happens in rise of kioshy, where Jianzhu wants to control Kioshy because he wants to use her as a tool to control, and bring stability to the Earth kingdom. !<

Plus this is the first time we see Azula in action!"
498,2020-06-02 01:44:40,guh96r,As a kid I remember watching the book 1 finale and thinking oh wow the avatar state is cool. But rewatching as an adult I was like okay that’s a bit anticlimactic he should just use that all the time. Low and behold not one episode later they show that people in the world were thinking the same thing with the earth king general. Guess I forgot how smart this show was over the years.
499,2020-06-01 20:15:38,guh96r,"""DON'T INTERRUPT UNCLE!"" always gets me. XD"
500,2020-06-02 00:09:43,guh96r,"Azula has entered the chat. I'm so apprehensive about the live action because, where are they gonna find a girl that can do her justice? Grey DeLisle's performance, how can that be matched?

She is menacing physically and a master manipulator but the hairline cracks show from the start. Zuko's expression as she tells him Ozai wants him home is great, the subtle balance between disbelief and excitement/hope. The acting on the animators part should really be recognized more. 

The shenanigans with trying to trigger the Avatar state are funny, General Fong is realistically absurd in his quest to get the mystical key to victory. And the fact Aang didn't even try to 'save' Katara in the Avatar state shows why they can't rely on it. He's indiscriminate in it."
501,2020-06-01 14:57:08,guh96r,"It unfortunately shows that this episode had so many different people working on it, it's just a little disjointed. Zuko and Azula's monologues are a bit awkwardly inserted, Aang abruptly changes his mind once again (as well as initially, but then it was better-supported), Roku shows up to deliver an exposition dump out of nowhere (you'd think he would try that one earlier), and the brief humorous insets feel unfitting compared to Fong's seriousness. Also, Aang's willingness to be used as a living WMD severely clashes with some of his later attitudes.

Still quite good though, and how could it not be with that impressive Azula introduction. An interesting detail is how we've now seen extremists/traditionalists and moderates/progressives on all sides."
502,2020-06-01 19:52:00,guh96r,I think this is a great transition from season 1 to season 2. Both Zuko and Aang heavily reflect on their actions in season 1 and experience their consequences. It really provides a nice set up for the inner conflict they experience for the rest of the season.
503,2020-06-02 02:53:43,guh96r,"This episode, to me, represents how far the show matures from some of Book 1. It introduces a cool new characters with new skills, answers some questions the audience would naturally have about Aang's abilities, captures the desperation of war, sets up an internal conflict for Aang, and takes the Iroh/Zuko subplot in a new direction.

And it's just casually thrown in there as the premier and pretty much nobody argues it's the best episode of Book 2, when it would probably be in the conversation for Book 1."
504,2020-06-01 16:07:50,guh96r,Last scene hits differently after I grew out my hair and is now past my shoulders. When I watched for the first time I was buzzcut.
505,2020-06-01 17:57:13,guh96r,"To be honest, this is one of my least favorite episodes. It just doesn’t make too much sense that they would attack Aang to bring out the avatar state, and they don’t really mention it in any other episodes. The side plot with Zuko is good though."
506,2020-06-01 18:35:49,guh96r,Azula's introduction was one of the best in the show.
507,2020-06-05 05:39:17,guh96r,Seeing Zukos initial reaction to Azula telling him that his father wants him back is always so sad. And the camera cutting to hide his scar behind azulas head as she is telling him is a cool little way to show what Zuko was prior to his banishment. Unscarred and less of the bitter hateful Zuko we have come to known.
508,2020-06-01 13:39:54,guh96r,General Fong was right
509,2020-06-01 14:50:05,guh96r,"What i dont get from this episode is it sets up for Aang to not use the avatar state anymore, especially since it has a potential to end the avatar cycle and it being triggered by anger at this point

Avatar state always seemed sort of a deus ex machina anyways so when >!aang finally did fight Ozai using it!< i was slightly disappointed"
510,2020-06-01 23:13:02,guh96r,"Stray thoughts

* Aang's nightmares at the beginning/ep in general would have been a great place to bring up his pacifist principles vs. mass murder while in the avatar state. The horror of the avatar state was implied, but it wasn't quite there imo
*  I really like that until she lightning bends to deal the killing strike, Azula doesn't use firebending
* Zuko chopping off his ponytail is the end of an era"

At the same time however, I can't exactly place my finger on how what has specifically changed so I'll probably will have to look it up.

This episode makes me wish there was a internet discussion board for it when it had came out (or it was released closer to this time period) if only to see people's initial reaction to the explanation of the avatar state. Without this episode, I could see plenty of people debating the same points brought on up by the characters on why Aang should or shouldn't just go and defeat the firelord with the avatar state. They managed bring and up those points before closing the argument by establishing it's a last self defense resort that risks destroying the rebirth cycle if Aang is killed in the state."
513,2020-06-01 19:48:39,guh96r,"For anyone that enjoys fanfics, there is a pretty good one that picks up right after this episode from Zukos point of view.

It diverges from the main series but ends in a relatively similar way.

I’d recommend it to anyone that has already seen the main series.

514,2020-06-01 11:39:17,guh96r,"I always guessed that Lo and Li were Azulon’s sisters, making them Azula and Zuko’s great aunts."
515,2020-06-01 14:47:03,guh96r,Azulon's concubines is a popular theory.
516,2020-06-02 02:03:54,guh96r,"Old ladies who lack firebending and no real backstory but traveling with a royal female. My theory is that they are chaperones, maybe even nanny types who came around after Azula and Zuko's mother died. Even though Azula is badass, at this point she's still a young teenage girl (and a princess!) traveling with a bunch of military men for long journeys. Li and Lo definitely must be chaperones."

518,2020-06-01 13:16:49,guh96r,I have sympathy for General Fong but I wonder if it's the years and years of endless war that drove him to be so crazy. Then he here's about Aang and thinks this can all be over soon. Why wait years for the avatar? Put everyone's lives into his hands? I don't blame him for trying but the extremes he went to were definitely unacceptable.
519,2020-06-01 12:24:29,guh96r,Even more badass when you consider that >!no one besides Iroh knew you could redirect lightning.!< Must have really shocked Azula to see such a move when she thought she knew all the firebending forms.
520,2020-06-01 13:19:08,guh96r,"It reminds me of the scene where Iroh stops Zhao's foot, makes you wonder if this their way to establishing Azula as the season's big bad."
521,2020-06-01 17:52:55,guh96r,Even that oaf over there knows to be quiet while fishing
522,2020-06-01 13:53:58,guh96r,"Technically not *everyone* since Zuko was the one who threw the Captain into the water and beat those two guards who were up on the deck with Azula, but Iroh was still pretty damn close lol."
523,2020-06-01 19:21:27,guh96r,I mean Iroh isnt exactly weak He is on par with his Brother
524,2020-06-02 02:58:46,guh96r,I think returning watchers get a bit desensitized over how powerful he is. I'm impressed this time around with how they manged to convincingly *not* make him seem like OP deus ex machina every episode.
525,2020-06-01 22:43:30,guh96r,"Katara getting buried and Aang on his knees begging them to let her go is fucking gut-wrenching to watch, and I’m on my first time through the series at 35. 10 year old you was absolutely valid to be afraid for Katara. That was intense."
526,2020-06-01 19:24:07,guh96r,I mean once you think about it She does look younger than Zuko probably 14  and hes 16 but I was Really shocked when I found out Sokka was older than Katara
527,2020-06-02 09:26:04,guh96r,"watching azula genuinely scares me. she's 14... i can't imagine how a 14-year old becomes the kind of person she is.

i'm not a first time watcher, but i don't remember a lot from the first time i watched the show, so whenver azula's on screen, i tense up because i'm really *that* scared for >!the gaang!< and/or zuko and iroh."
528,2020-06-02 05:11:55,guh96r,I’ve always wondered how much effort it takes to bury someone like the general did to Katara. Could a squad of Earthbenders just bury an opposing squad of Firebenders? Is that method of fighting just avoided due to the show being aimed at children?
529,2020-06-01 13:57:48,guh96r,"> Azulas intro is great. Such a fun villain to see.

You know, that whole ""Will the tides think twice about smashing you against the sea shore"" line is badass, but the older I get the more I realize it's... kinda extremely dumb on Azula's part lol. 

Like, your ship's captain, who is presumably much more experienced with sailing and weather conditions than you, has just advised that it would be dangerous to sail into port right now, and you're just like ""Pfft, I don't care, do it anyway or I'll kill you"".  

I mean I guess in the end she was proven right, since clearly they didn't all sink and drown in the tides, but the scene itself feels less like Azula being right and the Captain being wrong, and more like the Captain doing his job and Azula just kinda being an ass about it."
530,2020-06-01 12:19:23,guh96r,"We do actually see Azula using regular firebending briefly, when she counters Zuko--you might've missed it because her fire is blue, though!"
531,2020-06-01 10:35:37,guh96r,"> That's the face of a man who just realized his terrible mistake x 2.

Did anybody else notice how the Captain's mouth didn't actually move in the scene after this, when he's supposed to be saying ""Your Highness, I..."" before Zuko yeets him off the gangplank? 

I don't think I've ever noticed that before."
532,2020-06-01 17:42:56,guh96r,"I know some don’t like the random avatar state exposition, but I’ve always found it useful and really cool to watch >!(also, are those lion turtle statues Kyoshi is earthbending? Curious)!<

The scene with Zuko cutting off his hair is really the start of his true journey. That moment where he pauses when looking at the knife, before cutting his hair, and then looking at his cut hair really drives home how devastated Zuko is that his father has really rejected him. That hair is the fire nation, and now he has to cut it off. A very physical and painful separation from his life. Compre his reaction to Iroh who appears to chop off his topknot without a second thought or glance."
533,2020-06-01 12:21:41,guh96r,"Regarding the lightning bending, or lightning generation, it will be discussed more later on in Book 2 and given an explanation as to why we’ve not seen any other firebenders use it."
534,2020-06-01 12:22:28,guh96r,">We never saw her use actual fire-bending in this episode, which either means she can't or didn't think it would be useful here.

I don't know if you noticed but she does firebend just once with a punch (You see blue fire) that throws Zuko out of balance down the stairs, after which she tries the lightning."
535,2020-06-02 19:33:32,guh96r,"On the final scene. Definitely such a hard hit, he's coming off of the failed North Pole Mission, where he was hiding from the FN already. Then he finally thinks he might be accepted back without the Avatar (almost unthinkable for him) only to be betrayed by his sister (and father) yet again. Just absolutely destructive for him. So i think you've identified that this is almost a confirmation of ""banishment"" to full-on ""FN exile and enemy"""
536,2020-06-01 17:25:56,guh96r,"I think they kinda reference it by starting the episode with his nightmare about the avatar state. I wonder if his nightmare happens because he feels guilt for what happened at the north pole when he destroyed the fire navy (I know its hotly contested if Aang is responsible for their deaths, but I think Aang feels responsible for them)"
537,2020-06-01 14:24:47,guh96r,There’s a pretty interesting fanfic that takes a bit of a darker tone and illustrates this pretty well. https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5398503/1/Embers
538,2020-06-01 20:50:06,guh96r,"I don't think he actually killed anyone. Because of its rating the show is always extremely careful about how it depicts or implies death, always showing some quick shot of fire nation solders jumping out of a tank before it blows up, so I think it makes more sense to think that all the soldiers either fell in the water and were rescued or stayed on the ships as they were forced back to sea. Everything they show Aang doing is plausibly (in the world of the show) survivable."

542,2020-06-01 18:46:09,guh96r,I read on the wiki that Zuko was a late bloomer. He improves and awakens his skills a teenager later in season 2 and season 3. Later being able to duel evenly with Azula one on one on the warship. Also Iroh says his abilities are blocked by his shame and inner turmoil from being banished.
543,2020-06-02 02:09:00,guh96r,"you bring up SUCH great points! they spare no daggers in the convo between iroh and zuko, it rips my heart out every time. zuko has said some shitty things to his uncle over the course of the series. 

to answer your question, i think he felt zuko, 13 at the time, couldn't go on such a dangerous journey without supervision/company. he definitely thought it was a wild goose chase because ozai only did it to get rid of him, but there was no way zuko was gonna give up and no way iroh was gonna let him go alone. luckily he was retired so he had nowhere else to be right?"
544,2020-06-01 22:10:49,guh96r,"I think establishing how the Avatar State works was a really good idea.  I also think is was a \*really\* necessary idea to explain why Aang needs to finish his training and they can't just shake him up & throw him at the Fire Nation.  


Because if they could just rile him up & point him in the right direction, the Earth General has a good point about all the people dying in the war when the Avatar could just kill the Firelord.  Here we see that until Aang learns some control there is no way to tell what might happen if they force him into the Avatar State"

*Of course* you want to end the war as fast as possible, who wouldn't? Countless lives have been lost and prolonging it makes things worse.

BUT even if Aang were ready and willing to kill hes still just *12 years old*.  And has no control over the state, as it is his current Avatar State is an agent of chaos. And that's not something you want on a battlefield.

So yeah, complicated problem presented with a controversial solution. I understand the General, but this was too risky."
549,2020-06-01 14:20:19,guh96r,The episode proves that he wasn't
550,2020-06-19 01:38:16,guh96r,"The point of this episode (as it pertains to Aang) is precisely to flesh out the drawbacks and risks of the avatar state. It's not that Aang won't ever use it again, but it is established as something that can hurt everyone including his close friends, and can only be triggered in the most dire of situations >!at least until later when we meet the guru!<. I understood it perfectly on my rewatch

(rest of this is series finale spoilers for others reading)

>!In the series finale itself, the importance of the Avatar state isn't just that it gets Aang out of the corner he's been physically backed into by Ozai, but that it actually resurfaces a different conflict. Aang in the Avatar state has the upper hand in the fight by leaps and bounds but his moral struggle- to defeat the firelord without killing him- is now a huge concern and it's implied that Aang is deliberately trying to fight his avatar state rampage to prevent himself from committing the deadly sin he is so opposed to. He only finally manages to get out of the avatar state at the very last moment and it's followed by ""I'm not going to end it like this"", after which the final phase of the fight is Aang defeating Ozai without the avatar state (albeit with the energy bending stuff, and that is the prime offender for 'deus ex machina' rather than the avatar state). !<"
551,2020-06-01 12:01:58,guh96r,"That’s a possibility, I suppose. They do dress very regally, and clearly hold a position of enough respect that they can just openly critique Azula and get away with it, so they might be royal, but you’d think if they were a direct relation then they would be addressed as such at some point. It’s also a bit unusual that they’re >!both non-benders, since the firebending genes seem to be pretty strong within the royal family.!< Maybe some more distant cousins of the family or something?

I did once see a post on here theorizing that they might be Azulon’s former concubines, who were allowed to stay with the royal household and maintain a position of honor after he died. It actually kinda makes sense to me, even if I’m not sure if the creators would necessarily include something like that (though having official concubines *was* a very common practice among East Asian monarchs)."

When faced with danger for his crew, Zuko tried to disregard their safety, but couldn't bring himself to fully commit to that in the end.

I think it is super callous and risky, and it shows how assured she is that her terror tactics will trump every other concern.    
The captain doesn't say it's impossible, just risky.  It turned out he apparently made it when ordered to do it anyway.  Azula keeps forging ahead despite bad odds trusting in terror to keep everything working.  And we will see in future episodes that it will continue to work.

Well, a lot of ships went down in arctic water.  Even if we assume nobody got hurt as the ships sank (a stretch) you then have many, many sailors swimming in freezing water.  The Firebendings might be able to save themselves the way Zuko did when he swam under the ice, but there a \*lot\* of nonbender sailors and even if the benders somehow saved everyone they have no where to go and no supplies.   


We don't see the Water Nation taking lots of prisoners, so I'm thinking it's pretty bad for the crews of all those ships The Water Spirit/Aang sank."
568,2020-06-01 23:18:03,guh96r,"Then that's silly. I know it's a cartoon about magic kung fu, but it should still run on some kind of internal logic. A massive tsunami like that would kill a lot of people based on the reality established by the show."

586,2020-06-02 09:21:12,guh96r,"Interesting that you interpret ""not sure he would win"" as less than 50:50 chance. I usually interpret it differently.  
Ozai kept himself in physical shape, but bending strength depends on other things. That's why Toph could whoop The Boulder's ass even though she was a little girl and he worked out. She was more in tune with the earth. 
Remember Zuko's bending was always weakened by his psychological issues, especially after switching sides.  
Iroh was always psychologically and philosophically strong. He was very in tune with what it meant to be a fire bender.  Ozai could definitely beat him in a situp contest, but I don't think he's as strong as Iroh in all the other ways that are important for bending.  And as Iroh said in the first episode, a fire bender's strength comes from the breath, not the body."

589,2020-06-02 18:15:43,guh96r,"The thing about the philosophical view point wasn't that one was inherently stronger than the other, but that Zuko was more suited to the less hateful style. The main core of fire bending though is breath control. Anyone who is in shape is going to have more aerobic endurance. Iroh was pointing out breath control to Zuko because he was focusing on drawing power from the wrong place. However, diaphragm muscles would still be needed."
590,2020-06-02 20:40:43,guh96r,"If bending comes down to physical fitness and no philosophy is correct, how do you account for Toph being the most powerful earth bender?  
In the show as Toph was teaching earth bending, she taught Aang that it was all about how tough you were mentally and that the air bender philosophy of finding alternative approaches wouldn't work.  Which shows that mentality and philosophy are linked to your bending strength.  
They also explained that Toph learned her earth bending philosophy directly from the badger moles. This understanding granted by the original earth benders helped her find a philosophy that made her a stronger bender.  
  
Like Toph, Iroh also went to the source of fire bending to learn a more true understanding of fire bending."
591,2020-06-02 20:46:56,guh96r,"Philosophy only matters when someone is ill suited for it. Ozai and Iroh are respectively well suited to their philosophies, thus it's irrelevant to bring it up. Ozai would probably suck at use fire bending the way Zuko and Iroh did it, like how Zuko sucked at fire bending the other way until he actually had something to be angry about."
592,2020-06-02 23:12:18,guh96r,So is Toph the only earth bender that has good self-philosophy agreement? Why is she so strong?
593,2020-06-02 23:24:33,guh96r,Because she's naturally skilled at it and her blindness let her pick up aspects of earthbending that no other earthbender uses?

Where is the Black Community “solidarity” with Asians when we have been dealing with COVID prompted Racist attacks, that have also been caught on film?

I know, assault and murder are different things, but the imbalance of Asians supporting blacks vs Blacks supporting Asians is too apparent. 
And the fact that many of these incidences are actually blacks committing the acts is troubling, yet we still offer support..

Lulu Wang, Michelle Phan, Amber Liu, and I'm sure I may be missing some. Not surprisingly, they also don't have white partners.

Yes, there are individuals who support African Americans, but collectively speaking is it enough to say Asians as a whole have shown support for Black people? No. I’ve also seen a fair enough of Asians engage in Anti-Blackness. There was also an Asian American officer involved in this case, too. We must take ownership of that. We have experienced racism before COVID-19. But it was being seen as the other, not as a threat. If you learned anything from the racism from COVID-19, you should realize this has been the reality for Black people, Latinx and Muslim people for years with greater intensities."

You see my point? You have to scour the internet to find any, and while in this Reddit post alone shows how many dozens of Asians supporting the Black community?

692,2020-05-18 00:26:01,glp9yr,"In America, Lucy Lui is considered a beauty and was on all of the “most attractive lists” in her prime. Sandra Oh, is one of the most sought after and revered Asian actresses in America. She also has amazing hair. Just love them both and wanted to point that out!"
693,2020-05-18 01:52:38,glp9yr,"Honestly, I don't really have anything to say about your eyelid fixation as per your post history, but I just gotta point out I don't understand your examples. A few of them like Daniel Liu and Lewis Tan clearly have double eyelids.

Also, quite a lot of the men you listed are considered attractive in America but not at all in Asia (no offense). So if we're talking about American beauty standards, it's well-known that Americans love the monolid look on women, like Han Hye-Jin.

I'm not trying to nitpick but it's just a confusing mishmash of examples for the above reasons.

In general I do get that monolids are seen more often on famous guys in Asia. Some is biological (single lids are more common in guys), some is constructed societal standard. I think there are more monolidded women in kpop than kdramas for some reason - some famous ones are Sohee (Wonder Girls = semi-OG kpop btw), Seulgi (Red Velvet), Dahyun (Twice), Yeji (Itzy), Jisoo and Yein (Lovelyz), and Minah (Girl's Day). If you don't follow kpop these groups are publicly very well-known and their members are (predictably) considered goddesses by fans."
694,2020-05-17 23:15:18,glp9yr,"This is just my take on it and not to say any of this is true (I hope this does not offend anyone) but I think it is primarily seen in Asian culture that women are supposed to appear young and innocent, so larger doll-like eyes reflect that whereas for men, they are primarily viewed as attractive for their stoic and strong image. So a monolid shows off an expression that can be a fierce stare better than a double lid. Think of male actors like Woo Do Hwan. I think once again it is also another bias that women have to face in society sadly..."
695,2020-05-18 00:00:28,glp9yr,"According to studies that have been done on the prevalence of double eyelids in Asian populations, it seems that statistically double eyelids are more prevalent in the female population than the male population. See [table summarizing past studies on prevalence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-14829-4/tables/1) from this [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-14829-4).

Here's a rather detailed (jargon-filled) [article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2884917/) explaining the differences between Caucasian eyes and Asian eyes and what the concept of ""double eyelids"" is in relation to the different types of eyes. There are pictures illustrating the differences.

Most importantly, the above article gives a little background as to why double eyelids are favored in females in Japan:

> In **1896**, Mikamo described the “double eyelid” feature and how it was considered an indicator of beauty by writers and artists of that time period. Single eyelids that did not possess a distinct supratarsal crease were described as “monotonous and impassive.” He estimated the incidence of the ***single eyelid*** in Japanese women to be approximately 17 to 18% and thus concluded that the double eyelid was the physiologically normal appearance. 

(Emphasis mine.)

Note: Mikamo is a Japanese plastic surgeon.

Since the quote is about Japan, it might not be as applicable for all of Asia but since you're making generalizations and do mention Japanese celebrities, I think the article is fitting for this discussion.

---

And finally, since we're making sweeping generalizations and making the personal opinions of some random stranger into a factual statement, I'll cheekily offer my personal opinion as the end all, be all of judgement on beauty:

> out of all the male examples you listed, only Kim Woo Bin is deserving of praise for his unique looks. All the others are forgettable. Why does Kim Woo Bin deserve the praise? Because he's the cutest dinosaur *alive*."
696,2020-05-18 16:25:57,glp9yr,"I honestly prefer the mono eyelid look.  I like Kim Go Eun and Park So Dam, I think they're both beautiful.  

Maybe it's because I have a double eyelid look myself (am also Asian).  So maybe this is a case of me preferring the mono eyelid because it's not what I currently have?  (Same as those caucasians wanting to tan, and asians wanting to be ""whiter"")."
697,2020-05-18 03:29:04,glp9yr,"I'm glad to see diversity in FLs in newer dramas, like Itaewon Class's Kim Da-mi and TKEM/Goblin's Kim Go-Eun in the recent years. Monolid and double eyelid actresses are both beautiful but I do agree that there sadly is a double standard. 

Where I'm from (Philippines), there is high beauty and aesthetic regard for Chinitas (Filipino-Chinese girls) and Chinitos (Filipino-Chinese boys) who have monolids. There are plenty of mixed race locals here who have been in the country since they were kids but born of Fil-Chinese/Korean/Japanese parents. Historically, there are many Chinese who emigrated from Fujian province back in the day and there are several Chinese schools especially in metropolitan areas. There is a notion that Filipino-Chinese are richer than normal Filipinos albeit being stingy.  

However, in our entertainment industry, the preference is still with those who have Euro-centric features or have Filipino-Caucasian parents (e.g. [Liza Soberano](https://wheninmanila.blob.core.windows.net/wheninmanilabucket/2020/02/Liza-Soberano.jpg), [Anne Curtis](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BAqxSBoEgYyGCEsTU_n_2tO_05W70eAm9TIKS5PsJHsNSNdBaYoIAWuXqo0AFGrqPg4WUHNVqnMc9BaxrE4u6HXPfCh6kKA=w1200-h630-rj-pp), [Megan Young](https://assets.rappler.com/D4E9108158EE404FB1B1A416F45FDF2F/img/901A94928B6E4495A4563846022577C0/megan_young_901A94928B6E4495A4563846022577C0.jpg)).

The female actresses (or any female in general) are considered less attractive when having monolids and often pressured to get double eyelid surgery, whereas men in kpop or kdramas are equally attractive with or without monolids which kinda pisses me off in a way, as someone with monolids. 

(Ok reading this again, I literally just repeated what you said lol)"
699,2020-05-18 11:47:05,glp9yr,It's more like a trend thing. It is kinda trendy to have monolids for both men and women sometimes now.

And for the male lead cast it was mixed.

Woo Bin, Kang Min-hyuk, Kang Ha-neul, Park Hyung-sik all single eyelids. All very goodlooking.

What I mean is - for Asian men/ Korean men there are equally as much men with single/ double eyelids promoted as goodlooking. For females its mainly double eyelids"

So my first intro to KWB was via [Vampire Idol](https://mydramalist.com/3076-vampire-idol/cast) and I was horrible with names back then so the trio of them was always Dinosaur (KWB), Vampire (Lee Soo Hyuk) and Ears (Hong Jong Hyun) to me.

HAHAH that is such anthropomorphic cuteness.

I find it so funny how people nickname actors/characters, especially when they can't keep track of their actual names. My mum keeps unsolicitedly narrating the cdrama she's watching (Across the Ocean to See You) to me, and she calls them weird names like ""Bird"" (apparently one of the actress' mouth looks like a beak, which is super random to me lol) and ""Bird's Sister""..."
714,2020-05-18 23:22:39,glp9yr,"Ha, my mom uses nicknames too! My mom watched Tree With Deep Roots with me, which was her first intro to Lee Soo Hyuk. She immediately went that's what vampires are supposed to look like right? So he's still vampire. 

My mom rarely bothers to remember any names, just picks either notable features or roles to refer to them. So like Goblin is Gong Yoo and Grim Reaper w/ hat is Lee Dong Wook while Grim Reaper w/ motorcycle is Jung Il Woo.

She's slightly better with Chinese names but will still resort to ""random"" descriptors like ""nose dot"" for Hu Yi Tian because he has a mole/freckle? on his nose tip."

The backlash for the british actor was there, because it totally wouldn't work with the original origin/story.( The way of speaking is also very different and in the USA there are (almost) no Dubs , make the difference in character even higher.)

Another example is, when they use american actors to play germans (they act probably more like the stereo types )and when they speak german, it's even for a native  hard to impossible to understand what they try to say. But for the Americans  it's ok, because they don't  understand it eather and for them it's authentic enough.

It’s a long path, but writing off progress is dismissive. We have to normalize it first before it stops being a tag line"
867,2020-08-19 03:39:37,ic5kgj,"Context matters. Asian Americans rarely get represented in American media and when they do, it's rarely positive. Asian American men have been emasculated by Hollywood as unattractive weirdos with foreign accents for a long time. They almost never get the lead role. It's rare for the Asian community to get this kind of representation where the producers cast attractive Asian men and aren't asking them to play into negative stereotypes for people to laugh at them. Progress was made to change that. And that's why the term ""Asian American"" was highlighted.

You want a color blind world but don't realize that people in power will cast and write scripts with race in mind, which negatively impacted people of color. It happens because internal prejudices and subconscious biases persist. It's not that ""racism has gone away and now people keep looking for it."" Racism has *always* been an issue. The colorblind mentality is outdated and doesn't address the racism that happens in this country. If we want to make real progress, then we have to be open to the racial issues that communities are facing rather than saying ""but why make this about race?"" Otherwise, we will have a country that is ignorant to those problems."

Firstly, it demonstrates that Korra is learning that being emotionally vulnerable is okay and important for growth. Secondly, it illustrates her trust of Tenzin. He truly is a wonderful mentor and father figure. Finally, it portrays Korra as more human. Up until now, she has put up a wall and conveyed everything through her actions and brutish attitude. I'm really glad we got to see her true feelings this time, and I'm looking forward to her maturity and growth."

Girl please, that's your future wife.!< 

Tarrlok is such a smarmy politician I kinda love it? He knows how to play the game. Use the Airbender customs against them to get a seat at the table to talk to Korra. Throw a gala in her name and basically gloat her to join the task force with aid from the press. He got exactly what he wanted.

And ugh the final scene is always hard to watch. Thank goodness for good dad Tenzin. Seriously I feel like everyone needs a hug after that."
911,2020-08-19 06:56:04,ib3egw,"My thoughts on episode 4.

1. In this episode and the last episode difference in social class is shaping up to be a theme in LOK.
2. I really like seeing evil waterbenders, the only waterbending villain from ATLA is Hama. I think considering that water is the element of emotionality it makes sense for Tarrlok to be overly ‘friendly’ and manipulative. Like, showing up to Tenzin’s home during dinner unannounced and showering Korra with extravagant gifts.
3. For a waterbender, Korra is pretty emotionally repressed.
4. I think it’s interesting the way the invention of media has made the avatar into a sort of politician too. Korra’s getting interviewed by journalists and is on the paper and on the radio. I can see her running into trouble with this because she’s so hot headed and straightforward. Public reception is a big element of LOK, like how popular Amon and the equalist movement is it would be a huge problem for Korra if the public started hating her.
5. Certain parts of LOK really evoke genuine terror. Like, seeing Korra so helpless and genuinely scared of Amon is really powerful. ATLA evokes a lot of emotions too, like grief, joy, anger sometimes fear too but I don’t think any parts of it (except for the puppetmaster episode) was so genuinely terrifying.
6. Don’t have much to say at this point about Asami, I’m hoping we see some more character from her later other than as a love interest for Mako."

914,2020-08-19 18:02:05,ib3egw,"First timer here: 

Seeing Korra be legitimately scared of Amon caught me off gaurd by a lot honestly, and really made me like her character so much more. And it didn't even feel like a cheap way of doing so either, as someone with the ability to take away one of the main sources of Korra confidence would of course be a terrifying thing to go up against. It all just felt so real and so raw, I loved it. 

Tenzin is once again one of my favorite new characters, nuff said. His kindness to Korra is admirable, as well as everyone's admiration for him. He clearly demands so much respect and gives off an aura of authority (somewhat like Pakku in ATLA, minus the sexism) but he is still a loving and kind man, and his family (and by extension Korra) actually see that and love him for it. 

The imagery of the chi blockers' eyes in the darkness as Korra was dragged into the temple was terrifying, and a great way of displaying how disoriented she was. (Also is it just me that is reminded of the Talon agents from the Batman comics? No one else sees it? Ok.) 

So I'm probably gonna get some flak for this, but I'm not particularly impressed with Asami just yet. Like i went in with some pretty high expectations given how much the community loves her, but by the end of the episode all I really know about her is that she's pretty, rich, and Mako's girlfriend. That's it. Now I'm going to assume she's going to be much more fleshed out in future episodes, but tbh I was really hoping she'd have a more memorable debut aside from just derailing Korra's romance arc with Mako. However, I will be patient. 

Nust noticed how the square roofs of the Satomobiles have a similar shape to easter Pagodas, as well as the patterned passenger windows. Really nice to get some reminders of from where this universe is inspired amongst all the obviously western buildings and cultural aspects. 

Also Hiroshi Sato's accent has got to be one of the most satisfying things in the show so far. Like honestly the man could read a phone book and I'd pay to listen."

917,2020-08-19 04:02:33,ib3egw,"This episode has a lot to work through so let’s just jump into it!

KORRA AND AMON

So I’ve said before that Amon was an inspired choice for a villain to Korra, and I want to dig into that a bit here. From the very first line of dialogue she spoke, it was clear that being the Avatar is core to Korra’s identity, and that she has no idea who she is without that identity. This puts her immediately at odds with Amon and the equalists, because she’s not just a bender, she’s the most bender, and she literally can’t imagine a version of herself without bending.  

You could theoretically make the same argument about Aang, but as much as I believe he would be scared to lose his bending, it’s not the very center of his being the way it is for Korra, and Aang without his bending would still know who he was. Aang wouldn’t have a nightmare about Amon coming in the night to take his bending away, but Korra does, because the concept of her becoming a non bender is the most terrifying thing she can think of. And I’m not saying Korra is a baby who can’t stand the idea of not being special, I think her characterization is strong and makes a lot of sense, I’m just saying that Amon wouldn’t have worked as a villain for Aang as well as he does with Korra.

As for the actual conflict of the episode, Korra being hesitant to join the Amon task force is a strong character moment. As much as she is a brash, cocky young Avatar, she’s still human, and she wants to avoid the worst possible outcome at all costs, at least until Tarrlok puts her on the spot and makes it impossible to refuse. Her whipping around in the opposite direction and challenging him to a duel is also a realistic response to fear, trying to make herself as big as possible to trick herself into thinking she’s actually not afraid.

I do want to say, I’ve never been a fan of the “it’s not time for me to defeat you yet” trope, and that’s no different here. I think a more effective version of this scene would have been for Amon to show up alone, but not to fight Korra, just to talk to her about the exact stuff I talked about. There’s a reason that being a non bender is the worst thing she can imagine, and it’s the (stated) reason why Amon is working to dismantle the bending establishment. Benders just have an inherent advantage in the world of Avatar, and Amon directly challenging Korra on that would have been a better choice than what actually happened in the episode.

FUTURE INDUSTRIES

Asami is okay. Her introduction to Mako is a little cliché for my tastes, and all I can tell about her character is that she’s… nice? She really doesn’t have much characterization at all in this episode, which is especially noticeable when the rest of the main cast is absolutely oozing with character, including her father. I’m not mad at her existence, but she really didn’t leave a strong impression, I’m hoping to get to know more about her personality.

Hiroshi reminds me of a certain world leader who got started with a small loan of a million dollars (albeit waaaay more likable) and I’ll just leave that observation there. I do like the fact that the Fire Ferrets got a corporate sponsor, and Mako saying he’d tattoo their logo on his chest if they wanted makes perfect sense, given his relationship with money. Also Sato-Mobile is a great pun, 10/10.

TARRLOK AND THE CITY COUNCIL

I do like the archetype of a slimy politician, and Tarrlok fits that pretty much to the letter. The way he set up the gala for Korra to reverse psychology her into accepting the role on the task force was a brilliant move, as well as the way he got the task force approved in the first place. I think Tenzin laid the doubt on a bit heavy, it makes it pretty obvious that Tarrlok has bad intentions from the beginning. Subtlety would have been the right move here, building up to a big reveal of corruption, rather than Tenzin just outright telling the audience not to trust him. That said, I still do like Tarrlok, I’m looking forward to more from him.

LITTLE THINGS

The romance is pretty awkward, not gonna lie. The romance was definitely the weakest part of ATLA for me and a lot of other fans, and I’m not optimistic for it in LOK either.

I thought I recognized Tarrlok’s voice, and I looked him up. He’s Bubble Bass in Spongebob. Now you are burdened with that knowledge as well. Also “Jet” in Ember Island Players and SECRET TUNNEL!

SECRET TUNNEL! THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN! SECRET SECRET SECRET SECRET TUNNEL! Yeah.

I know the opening scene is a dream, but Korra really shouldn’t be firebending indoors.

Tenzin is a great father/mentor figure for Korra, I’m really starting to love their relationship.

The musical transition at the end of the council scene was really goofy, but it made me chuckle.

I know that blessing a meal is common to a lot of cultures, but it’s pretty weird to see in Avatar. Not bad weird, but weird.

Mako’s makeover and the butler guy are great.

Extreme close up “Get outta town!” was hilarious.

Why does Lin have such a big chip on her shoulder about Korra? I get that she caused a ruckus her first day in town but this seems a little severe. Maybe that’s just what it’s like when Toph is your mom idk.

The waterbending SWAT team carting around a big tank of water as riot gear is a clever solution, and a good evolution of Katara’s water pouches. That said, I’m pretty sure this is police brutality.

I’m intrigued by the flashback, but I assume it’ll play in full in a later episode so I’ll save my thoughts.

SUMMARY

There’s a lot of good in this episode, but I think there’s also a fair amount of missed potential. I really wanted for Korra and Amon to have an honest discussion about his ideals, and this episode provided the perfect chance for that. I think Tarrlok could have been a bit more subdued in his approach, and Asami could have been introduced with much stronger character traits. I don’t want to labor over comparisons to ATLA too much, but every single major character left a strong impression from their first appearance, and LOK characters have been a lot more hit or miss for me. I don’t dislike anyone, but I feel left wanting for more.

But I don’t want to dwell on the negative, because there is a lot to like about other aspects. Most of the comedy beats hit really well for me this episode, especially Mako and Asami’s date. Tarrlok’s political scheming was great, even if it was a little obvious, he really knows how to play the game as a public official. And of course the character moments for Korra were all strong and made sense for her personality.  

I think everything that’s been laid out is a really strong framework for the story moving forward, but I’m still waiting for it to all come together. We’re still in the early stages, so I’m just gonna do my best to sit back and enjoy the ride. See you all in the next one."
918,2020-08-19 10:31:13,ib3egw,"Way back in the day when I saw the show for the first time and it still had to win me over - this was the episode that ultimately did it. 

Korra has 2 main weaknesses: Over reliance on her physical strength (includes bending), and lacking self restraint as well as having a very short fuse. 

We've seen both already in action in the past few episodes, but this episode is a coordinated 3-way punch exploiting every of her weaknesses and fears against her.

She truly does not know who she would be without her bending, so if Amon got to her at any moment, he wouldn't just erase her bending - but her self-image as well.  

And BOY OH BOY does this episode let you feel that fear! Such an epic moment. Best episode of Season 1, but not by much because we all know - this ride has just started."
919,2020-08-19 04:20:02,ib3egw,"Nice, one per day now"
920,2020-08-19 07:29:44,ib3egw,"This is by far the best episode of Legend of Korra so far and I’d argue it’s up there with some of the great ATLA episodes.

# Setup of Tarrlock and Asami

It starts off with Korra’s nightmare. It’s a pretty good way of showing how afraid she really is of Amon. It also shows that she has a pretty simplistic idea of how this conflict is going to go. She imagined that Amon would just take her bending away from her, which is the one thing that she’s based her entire life around. In truth, things look a little different, but we’ll get to that.

We’re also introduced to Asami, which is nice, because she’s actually a pretty cool character. But she doesn’t do much of interest this episode. I really didn’t like the fact that her mother’s backstory is only told in a conversation. This show is a visual medium, dammit! Show us some actual people being attacked by actual firebenders rather than just having all of the characters (Bolin, Mako, Asami, Amon) complain about it.

What I find very interesting about the opening segments of this episode is the introduction of Tarrlock. He’s a sleazy politician who seems to have a great amount of control over the council. It’s pretty obvious that he wants to be the one to take credit for Amon’s defeat. As such, he’s trying to get the Avatar to fight on his side to get some publicity for his effort.

This highlights a major difference between the world that Aang lived in and Korra’s world. In Aang’s time, the Avatar’s goal and purpose of defeating the fire lord was self-evident and even declared to be his destiny. There was never anything that could stop this necessity. The people he met along the way were either allies or enemies (though of course things get a little complicated with for example General Fong or the Dai Li).

Korra’s world does not have such an obvious enemy, instead there’s many different people with different interests. Of course, they would want to have the avatar fighting on their side, so they will use their political tricks and manipulations to get her to join them. That’s exactly what Tarrlock is doing this episode. His flattery and gifts don’t really impress her, since she’s never been interested in material things. What she wants to do is kick ass and be the avatar. 

Her fear of Amon makes her hesitant, but after Tarrlock starts involving the public’s opinion and pressure, she feels compelled to join him. The scene where she gets questioned by the press is really good, because it shows that one of the vulnerable points of Korra is her insecurity of not being a proper avatar who can protect people. It also shows just how much different the job of the avatar is compared to Aang’s job. Now the avatar faces public scrutiny and needs to explain and justify her actions as well as announce her plans.

The public’s opinion as well as Tarrlock’s manipulation have essentially made Korra into a political tool rather than an actor who can restore balance according to her own will. I believe that this direction of making the Avatar more politically complex to fit a more modern, post-war world is brilliant.

I loved that Lin told her that she didn’t deserve any of this. Of course Lin is correct and Korra knows this, but again, she is part of a political game and the events in her life seem to have very little to do with what she wants nor do they give her much opportunity to deserve anything.

# Korra vs Amon

The initial successes of the SWAT-style raids (which are, by the way, exceptionally well done and the whole water tank thing is great world building) causes Korra to get overconfident. Perhaps it could really be possible to simply use her bending to kick her enemy’s butt and be the hero, just like she’s always wanted to be. After all, how strong can that nonbender really be on his own? So she challenges Amon to a duel.

And that’s where things really go south. She goes to the statue expecting a fair fight that would somehow end this conflict. But instead, she gets ambushed. She’s defeated within just a couple seconds and the antagonist could easily strip her powers and thus her identity away. But he doesn’t. And that’s where the show becomes truly brilliant, in my opinion.

Amon has clearly shown that he can easily beat Korra at her own game. But he’s not even interested in that, because that’s not the game he’s playing. She just didn’t understand up until this point that this whole thing is not about defeating someone or taking their bending away (unlike ATLA). It’s truly about a battle of ideals. Amon is the face of the equalist movement while Korra is in a sense the face of the benders. Amon knows that he cannot take away her bending, or else many people would get upset that such a central spiritual figure (who saved the world in a previous life) would be destroyed by an extremist and his movement would crumble. On the other hand, it also really wouldn’t have been a good idea for Korra to defeat Amon. If the primary advocate for non-bender rights would be violently beaten up by a bender, it would give rise to much more resistance against benders worldwide.

It is in this moment that it becomes clear that Korra is not only a political pawn in other people’s machinations, as established earlier in this episode, but she is also herself a political actor with responsibilities that go way beyond her abilities. Her struggle against Amon is not a question of power, but rather a question of truth and justice. And sure, LoK is not as deep as ATLA in terms of spiritual lore, but in terms of this stuff? It’s actually deeper in my opinion.

Amon is completely different from Ozai or Qin the conqueror. He’s a villain that any Avatar would have struggled to face, and that is especially true for a sheltered avatar fresh out of training. He represents a dismantling of Korra’s idea that her bending is a special force for good and that she can bring balance to the world by beating up villains. These are the two core values that she grew up with. Plus, his emotionless, no-nonsense personality stands as a stark contrast to her. And her personality, that of an arrogant bender, is the exact thing that he hates the most. All of this combined makes me think that Amon is the very best villain that’s ever been put to on the screen in the Avatar universe.

The final scene of the episode is very beautiful. We really see that Korra is devastated because of how fundamentally she was just destroyed and how much power Amon really has over her. Tenzin is there to comfort her in a beautiful moment where the two bond and she finally opens up about her fears. It makes sense that Tenzin would feel a responsibility to take care of her. For one, he’s her mentor, but in addition, he’s the one who let her stay in Republic city. Back in episode 1, when she asked him to stay, this is basically what he was afraid of. That she would get into troubles that he would not be able to defender her from. And now it seems that he was wrong to let her stay, that she has become part of a world that he knew she was not ready for. It’s a really strong moment for both characters."

930,2020-08-20 22:13:30,ib3egw,"First time watcher. My thoughts will be briefer this week since I’m short on time:

- Korra struggling with her fear is totally understandable and it turns out she probably should have listened to it. If Amon has wanted to take her bending, he could have. If Korra had taken Tenzin’s advice and examined her fear, she could have realized that the fear came from a rational place and that she should give it some weight. However, since Korra is still not very emotionally mature, the only way she could deal with her fear is by rejecting outright, leading her to do the thing she was afraid of, and then suffering the exact consequence she foresaw (if not for Amon’s choice to not take her bending).

- the politics around Amon’s movement is really interesting. Tenzin’s point about not going after Amon so as to not garner more support for his cause makes a lot of sense and is a pretty sophisticated political message. The water tribe politician’s point of view makes sense too, so it’s a conflict between two different political views rather than between good and evil.

- One thing I thought about when Amon didn’t take Korra’s Bending: Amon and Tenzin share a similar view of the conflict. You have to win the hearts of the people.  Both are against taking out the leader of the opposing side since it would create a martyr and validate the opposition’s narrative."

Poor Korra is having nightmares and I don't blame her. She's just a kid, and unlike the old TLA gaang, she hasn't been fighting for survival her whole life. This is new territory for her, and she's coming to terms with the danger she truly faces as the Avatar. 

Seeing Asami and Mako become so close so quickly seemed a bit rushed to me. I mean they definitely look great together, and I'm glad they can look past their class differences and bond over their shared traumas. Excited to see that relationship evolve. 

Tarrlok is the perfect example of a sleazy politician using his power to manipulate Korra. I definitely disagree with his approach I just wish Tenzin's opinion was actually fleshed out instead of making him seem like he doesn't want to do anything. 

Amon's Chi Blockers are so stealthy. It's like having a whole army of Tai Lee's. It's just not fair. 

I'm not sure what Amon's angle is in all of this, but I'm not sure how Korra is going to prepare to counter his power. 

Wow, so much in that little flashback/vision Korra has. That's what I've been waiting for! Can't wait to see Korra enter the spirit world. 

Seeing Korra break down and cry with Tenzin was so heartwarming. I'd be terrified if I was Korra. Tenzin's wise words about accepting the presence of fear were very powerful. I look forward to hear more of his wisdom."
932,2020-08-19 14:11:53,ib3egw,"**Old Book 1: Air Review (& My Observations)**

[The Voice in the Night](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/lb_i.php?lb_id=13613215680b08582800&i_id=13615836820I04712000&p=5) - Another great episode, it managed to establish another main antagonist that Korra is going to have to deal with when it comes to sorting out the Bender vs Nonbender conflict, a man who pushes for benders whilst the other man pushes against them, 2 Extremes. Time for some Quoted Commentary!

> Then Tarrlok turns to the other council members and says that ""eventually, he will come for all us benders.""

>> Wait, ""us benders?"". The entire ruling body of Republic City is made of benders? And the entire police force too? That's... disconcerting

Lol, if it wasn't clear enough, yes, the entire council is made up of Benders, not bending masters or something like that, just benders who politics good, good enough to remain in power anyway. Notice how none of them actually care about giving any real input throughout the meeting. 

> He says that he's the representative from the Northern Water Tribe. Um... what? Not only is the Republic City council made only of benders, it would seem that, with the exception of Tenzin, nobody on the council is actually a native of the city. The city is being ruled by people from beyond its borders.

>> Maybe we should just let Amon win and get it over with.

Lol I don't know about that, but yeah Amon's point keeps being given more and more weight to it as the story goes on. And I really like thinking about how ATLA is going bridge these facts, especially after the *Imbalance* comics.

> Then he says, ""But I assure you, I have a plan. And I'm saving you... for last. Then, you'll get your duel. And I will destroy you. Then... you have my permission to die."" OK, that last sentence wasn't there, but it may as well have been. And I like the use of ""destroy"" here, because it's not a euphemism for ""kill."" She doesn't fear death; her punishment must be more severe. Torture, not of the body, but of the soul.

Weirdly enough, if he did destroy her publicly, she probably would still be seen as a martyr either way.

> **Terror of the Avatar**

> Oh that was good. Very good.

> Because this is a 12-episode series, it doesn't work like traditional episodic storytelling. Even episodic stories done in an arc format. Generally, in episodic stories, most or all of the plot threads are part of the overall action. Each has their own bit of setup, rising action, conclusion, and so forth.

> This series isn't like that. It's more like an HBO series than regular episodic stories. In that kind of series, there's not merely an overall arc; there's a single story being told. And sometimes, that means that you just have to have a plotline simmer for a while before it pays off. So you'll have some element in one episode that's not important to this one, but will be in the next. You do it that way because, time-wise, it needs to be here, so that it can already be established for later.

> This specifically relates to the Mako subplot of the episode. It's effectively irrelevant to this episode; Asami and Hiroshi Sato's introduction is all setup for later episodes. What makes this interesting is that it is integrated into this episode's main plotline: it helps pile onto Korra at the party, thus pushing her where Tarrlok wants her to go.

> The plot of this episode is really an examination of Korra. It's all about fear, and fear has two parts: why we're afraid and how we handle it. The first part is covered in the page quote. Remember: that's not really Amon saying it; that's what Korra thinks. She feels that losing her bending is equivalent to, if not worse than death.

> And for one borne to bending, one who learned three bending techniques practically since birth, that makes sense. Korra fears Amon because without bending... she would be nothing. It's the only thing she's ever known. It's what she was taught, what the OWL focused on teaching her. And that shaped who she is; she thinks bending is the coolest thing in the world. I suspect she thinks the Equalists are mostly just jealous of bending, since they can't do it. She has had no life other than bending, and thus she cannot imagine life without it.

> Not to mention the fact that the Avatar is defined by bending. Korra identifies as the Avatar; she has always done so. The Avatar is the person who can bend multiple elements; that's how Korra thinks of it. Amon has the power to not just strip away her bending, but to effectively destroy the Avatar.

> And if he can do that to her... what then? She will have failed the world. Compared to Aang's 60+ year reign, she is nothing; a failed Avatar who allowed a guy to destroy her before she really got started.

> The episode paints a very clear picture of how she handles it. She feels this fear, but her pride won't let her show it. She won't tell Bolin about her own fear of Amon; she keeps the fear inside, hidden from others. This lets her present to the world the face of a confident Avatar, worthy of Aang. Her fear of Amon now mingles with her fear of failure at being the Avatar. She thinks her fear makes her weak.

> This comes to a head at the party. She sees how people expect great things from her, as Hiroshi says, thus making her feel even more like a failure, more unsure of herself. And given her confidence up to now, I imagine that there is nothing Korra hates more than feeling unsure of herself.

> But note what it is that really makes her submit to Tarrlok's offer in the end: being called a coward. She's afraid, but her pride will not allow anyone to see her that way. Because deep down, she thinks she is a coward. To prove that she's not afraid of Amon, she forces herself to face the Equalists.

> And... it's easier than she thought. It's just ambushing some chi blocking thugs. It was easier than breaking into the rally before. Easier than fighting those two chi blockers. She can win this; she's the Avatar after all. Her easy victory fuels her confidence and pride, which smothers her fear. Amon is nothing to be frightened of. And to prove it, to prove herself to be the Avatar, she throws herself at Amon. She calls him the coward, the worst insult Korra could imagine.

> But it's all a front; the fear is still there. Alone, on the building, fear finds her again. But Amon doesn't show, so she leaves. Only it's a trap; she's taken into the darkness and chi blocked. And there, broken, she comes face to face with her nightmare. Her pride fails, her confidence turns to ashes. Because Amon knows her secret; beneath the lies, the front, even the Avatar title, she is nothing more than a frightened little girl.

> This scene is probably the main reason why people consider this series darker than ATLA. It's desperately human, a sequence that plays on our darkest fears; the interplay between Korra and Amon is almost rape-like. Aang may have had difficult fights, may have been run ragged, beaten down, and even killed once. But he was never broken.

> Amon broke Korra... without even touching her.

> Korra's flaw as a character isn't her fear. Aang would probably have been scared shitless at Amon too; as an airbender, he practically defines himself by bending. The difference is that he wouldn't have run from his fear the way Korra did. He wouldn't have buried it under pride; that's one of the things that allowed Korra to be maneuvered into joining the task force. Aang wouldn't have allowed easy victories to make him forget his very real fear and rush to face Amon.

> Korra's flaw is her pride, ego, and self-confidence. Her unvoiced fear merely allowed those to get the best of her.

What's amazing about this episode, that was kinda glossed over in this episode is the fact that out of the people who gave Korra advice, Tenzin was the guy who provided thoughts on fear and talking about one's fears. As established in the second episode, Tenzin is a flawed mentor, more often than not he thinks he knows what he's doing and yet as an Air Nomad, he only does so much as he thinks he can without giving much thought to other things he can do, such as protesting against Tarlokk's idea but not giving his own suggestions. Also >!the best part is that we learn of Tenzin's own fears as the son of Avatar Aang and how much he compares himself to his father!<

**From Way Back When (& My Observations)**

[The Voice in the Night.... Discussion Thread!](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/sws3z/official_episode_4_a_voice_in_the_night/) -  Out of the fear of running out of characters, Imma keep this short. Basically, folks loved the episode big time. Many felt really bad for Korra and some started speculating that new character Asami is an equalist spy.

> - The scene in which Mako is hit by Asami's moped mimics a similar event from FLCL, an anime that inspired ATLA.

It **is** Bryan Konietzko's favorite anime after all, glad he found a way to incorporate it into the show lol."
933,2020-08-19 16:38:49,ib3egw,"I watched this stuff come out live. Crazy it was over 8 years ago. 

Anyways, Tenzin is such a great character and mentor for Korra. Book one is definitely one of the best."
934,2020-08-19 20:39:43,ib3egw,"Damn they went hard on those chi blocker newbies, when we saw them practicing they weren't attacking that hard but after the taskforce froze the ones closest to the window they just started earthbending them straight into a wall like OUCH, you couldn't have just frozen all of em? Nah the guys in the back get concussions

It makes sense Amon didn't actually have the duel, Agni Kai and bending duel's don't seem like something an anti-bender would participate in. Korras fire being the only thing lighting up a whole room full of masked chi blockers pulling her arms apart and rapidly punching her back had to be scary af"
935,2020-08-20 00:01:42,ib3egw,"My first watch through, trying to keep up on episodes. 

I am still having mixed feelings, the first half of every episode feels not great to me, but it feels more satisfying by the end. 

One of the interesting pieces I see shaping up are the cultural developments and sort of the...uselessness of the Avatar. In ATLA different nations felt seperated, further apart, obviously so when it was a big point to make how far travel is without Appa, and Aang's role was very evident in the need to bridge the gap between cultures. With all the industrial advancement and so-called cooperation between benders, it sort of begs the question of, ok then what does the Avatar DO? I am sensing the Amon is a front for a bigger issue (I think the politician guy is in on it) and will shape up leading to Korra needing to make some sort of decision or action that removes her from the cultural and worldly expectations amd standards that this new city has built up.

Like many others, my favorite part was Korra crying at the end with Tenzin. Everything feels much more human now.

Shout out to Dee Baker, VA extraordinaire!"
936,2020-08-19 08:00:52,ib3egw,"Today's rewatch thoughts:

* Tarrlok is interesting to me, because unlike most Avatar villains, he doesn't really have an issue with the Avatar itself. In fact, he wants Korra to like him, because her involvement in his plans is great for PR. In a different timeline, where Amon isn't a problem, I could see them having a relatively friendly relationship.

* Maybe I'm slightly influenced by recent events, but the raid scene is kind of uncomfortable to watch. Some of those people get absolutely brutalized. I know that Avatar runs on a degree of fantastical action logic, but getting your head frozen in ice or being slammed into the wall by a block of earth must be dangerous. The whole fight scene *feels* like oppression.

* The move where Korra kicks the rock into the jumping chi blocker after she trips is one of my favorite bits of bending in the show. She's clearly off balance, but she can still instinctively use the earth as an extension of her kick. It looks totally natural for her.

* The breakdown at the end always makes me feel things. Tenzin's concern and relief is so well acted, and I feel so bad for Korra. She's barely even had any life experience, and she has to deal with being targeted and vulnerable."
937,2020-08-19 19:55:38,ib3egw,My favorite part of this episode is Korea's dream when Amon tells her she is nothing without her bending. I think it sets up her development well because it shows us she is pretty one dimensional at this point in her journey. I also really like this episode because it makes Amon seem super scary and smart because we see that everything he does is so calculated and he seems to understand all these characters better than they understand themselves. Definetley my favorite episode so far and I hope they build on this going forward.
938,2020-08-20 03:54:36,ib3egw,"Upon rewatch, I'm really impressed by how Book 1 managed to use Amon sparingly but effectively as an antagonist. For most of this season, he feels more like a phantom or a malevolent presence than a flesh and blood character who's never very far away - like that super creepy scene where he hijacks a radio broadcast out of nowhere to spread his propaganda across the city. The fact that the influence of the Equalists could potentially extend everywhere really leaves the viewer feeling as paranoid and on edge about them as Korra.

Amon is the perfect villain for Korra to face in her first season. Ever since she was a four year girl, she's built her identity around being a superhero known as the Avatar, and now some masked terrorist threatens to strip all that away from her - and she honestly doesn't know who she would be or what she would be without that purpose in life. For possibly the first time in her life, Korra is terrified, and a big part of her arc this season is facing up to her fears. However, to overcome a problem, you have to admit you have one in the first place, which is something Korra pointedly refuses to do out of pride until the final scene of the episode. If it wasn't already apparent in episode two, Tenzin becomes something of a father figure to Korra in this series (which is quite ironic, since Korra was literally Tenzin's father in her previous life. I wonder if she ever thinks about that and feels weird), and their relationship really shined in this episode, as Tenzin showed her about the same level of concern he would show his own daughters.

>!Lastly, Korra's saltiness towards Asami in these early episodes out of jealousy is even funnier in retrospect, now that we know the very last shot of the series is this.!<"
939,2020-08-19 14:47:57,ib3egw,Korra that's rude.
940,2020-08-19 23:01:22,ib3egw,"Organized crime runs rampant thru republic city: Council of Benders sleep

Tarlok plays Korra to get what he wants.

Korra crying probably for the first time in a long time.

Sato got a small loan of a million dollars.

Also kinda surprised Bolin and Mako didn't think about getting corporate sponsors earlier.

Actually surprised that Tenzin and Pema, mainly Tenzin aren't more of helicopter parents."
941,2020-08-21 03:14:38,ib3egw,"And thus, we have now been introduced to Asami Sato, a smart, sexy, rich non-bender who I really do like as a character.  Her father, Hiroshi, seems rather nice, and after meeting a lot of questionable fathers in ATLA, it is nice to see one who seems like a nice father.  And I like that he built himself up from nothing with just a loan and a dream.

Mako and Asami do make a cute couple.  What was that ship name?  Asamko?  Masami?  

I like after so long of playing animals, someone opted to let Dee Bradley Baker play a human being.  Tarrlok is such a snake.  He's charming and manipulative, less a man of principle and more a politician in it to gain what power he can.

I loved how Korra was not willing her fear of Amon.  Like I said, this is the first time, I think, Korra has truly felt fear.  At first she does not want to face Amon, the fear holding her back, and then, she reacts and just demands he face her.  I imagine Tarrlok trying to stop her with all the determination and intensity of Willy Wonka trying to summon help for Augustus Gloop in the tube.

And again, we get to see how dangerous, how well trained and capable the Chi Blockers are.  And Amon comes off in this moment as such a bad ass with that villain speech of him.  I love how he just walks out of the shadows, again, making him just creepy."
942,2020-08-23 10:48:03,ib3egw,That move Amon uses to knock Korra out cold was raw as fuck. We don’t see anything crazy like that in the original series
943,2020-08-24 16:26:53,ib3egw,"When I had first saw this episode, I recall suspecting Asami must have been secretly an evil character from her introduction. I think it was because she was oddly interested in Mako for someone she nearly ran over and just met a minute ago. Then only a few days later, she had her father hook Mako's team up with a sponsorship just when they needed it. 

I thought it was too good to be true. That there had to be some ulterior motive to Asami and her father wanting to help out the fire ferrets than just her father wanting to help people down on their luck in their ventures and Asami being sincerely interested in Mako."
944,2020-08-20 01:36:13,ib3egw,first time watching the show and i just love asami’s general vibe. very 1920s movie star like. i know we see more of her in the future but im excited to see what she’s up to

947,2020-08-19 12:42:55,ib3egw,"I remember when I first watched the series, I was shocked, I really believed that Korra had a tough exterior and interior.  
It are moments of vulnerability which make Korra and the show, for me atleast, an amazing show."
948,2020-08-19 21:24:57,ib3egw,"Korra’s crying in that moment always makes me tear up (at the very least). Tenzin and she have butted heads so many times at this point but he is so sweet and comforting to her in this moment. 

All her toughness gets washed away, and it shows she isn’t just the avatar. She is also a vulnerable girl who is scared when they entire weight of the world is on her shoulder."
949,2020-08-19 23:53:08,ib3egw,"I was feeling very ""meh"" about this episode until that last moment when she looks down to hide her face, then throws herself at Tenzin for a hug. I almost feel relieved at her forward motion here in character development. It really helps show her vulnerability and fear behind her bravado, and was a really sweet moment between her and Tenzin."
950,2020-08-19 07:37:51,ib3egw,"Mako? Emoting? In this economy? Shocking. I love seeing the beginning of everything again, though the anticipation might kill me since I only recently watched the first time. I loved how they showed off Tarrlok's tactical thinking instead of just telling us he was tactical."
951,2020-08-19 12:45:36,ib3egw,"~~Is this the first time you are watching the show?~~

Just saw your first comment so I'll change my question.

How much do you remember of when you watched the show for the first time?"
952,2020-08-19 05:05:14,ib3egw,"Because republic city requires the worst governance possible, at all times. This episode may be the legitimate high point for the government of republic city."
953,2020-08-19 16:15:11,ib3egw,"Which only explains why things have escalated to such a degree in the city.

Non-benders have *zero* say in the government, as un-elected representatives are easily swayed with every decision by a corrupt egomaniac. Meanwhile crime runs rampant with the bending triads openly intimidating people in broad daylight, but the police are only focused on arresting people that learn to practice skills to defend against benders.

Is it any wonder how the Equalists managed to grow such a militant following?"

He also voices all the animals in both ATLA and LOK"
958,2020-08-19 19:39:51,ib3egw,">I do want to say, I’ve never been a fan of the “it’s not time for me to defeat you yet” trope, and that’s no different here. I think a more effective version of this scene would have been for Amon to show up alone, but not to fight Korra, just to talk to her about the exact stuff I talked about. There’s a reason that being a non bender is the worst thing she can imagine, and it’s the (stated) reason why Amon is working to dismantle the bending establishment. Benders just have an inherent advantage in the world of Avatar, and Amon directly challenging Korra on that would have been a better choice than what actually happened in the episode.

I disagree. I think this scene is excellent and a crucial part in LoK. For a lengthy discussion of why, I'd recommend my post in this thread. And to respond to your more specific criticism: It would have been super boring for the confrontation between the protagonist and antagonist to be a simple conversation. As we know Korra, she would not have stayed and listened (she's not one to listen to long speeches anyway, which is why she needed to actually feel the fear). She would have started attacking Amon and then he would have had to defend himself or run away. If he defended himself, we'd basically be in the same situation as the actual episode, except he would not seem as in control. If he had run, he would not be scary at all and the entire impact he left on Korra would have been lost. So I really don't see your scenario working out in any reasonable way.

I agree that the ""I can't defeat you yet"" trope is in general pretty lame. But in this case, it makes perfect sense. Of course the world would be upset if the avatar has their bending taken away. And it actually makes the whole show more interesting, because it changes the main conflict from a ""who beats who"" to a bigger struggle of politics. Now we know Amon can easily beat Korra, so now the show becomes about how she can overcome him in another way. There's a new end goal and it's clear that Korra needs a bunch of character development since the only way she knew how to be the avatar so far, was to fight."
959,2020-08-19 06:14:56,ib3egw,I love this breakdown! Lin is very interesting as a character and she's my favorite. I definitely agree about your point that the confrontation with Amon here isn't as effective as it should've been

961,2020-08-19 19:24:25,ib3egw,"Great analysis.

1. I did not catch the Sato-mobile pun.
2. Yeah Amon has great potential, but the writers seems to go for the weaker story aspects with him. I do like the martyr angle though.
3. Asami does have a rather cliche introduction.
4. Lmao I did pick up that about Hiroshi. Doubt it was intended.
5. We don't know what Tarlokk actually wants yet. 
6. Tarlokk's VA also voiced every single clone in TCW and Perry the Platypus!

962,2020-08-19 22:34:09,ib3egw,">she literally can’t imagine a version of herself without bending.

The first words of the episode, spoken by Amon in her dreams: ""Once I take away your bending, you will be nothing.""

And I think she absolutely 100% believes this, and that is why Amon is so scary. For Korra bending is everything. If that is taken away ... there is nothing left."

978,2020-08-19 21:16:24,ib3egw,"That's fair, Korra probably wouldn't sit down with Amon over a cup of tea and calmly discuss the philosophy of equalism: she challenged him to a fight, and she would have fought if he showed up alone. So I think the ambush would still be mecessary even in my scenario, but what Amon says to Korra after the ambush could easily be adjusted into more of a ""check your privilege"" speech, and I still do think that would be more effective. 

As it stands from the episode, there really isn't a huge paradigm shift. Korra goes from being scared of Amon and wanting to stop him to being more scared of Amon and still wanting to stop him, but knowing it won't be as easy as she thought. With a more direct philosophical challenge, she would be forced to examine whether it's even right to stop him in the first place, or whether she should use her position as the Avatar to advocate for non benders.

As much as I don't like the ""I'll save you for later"" trope, I wouldn't mind it as much if it were framed as ""you're more useful to me for now if you keep your bending"" rather than ""it would be inconvenient to me if you lost your bending right now."" I hope that makes sense.

And I do want to clarify, I don't think what happened in the episode was bad, just a little bland, and I think my version is a bit spicier."
979,2020-08-19 16:18:41,ib3egw,"I'm interested to see more from Lin, she seems really bitter over something but I couldn't tell you what.

And the scene with Amon wasn't bad necessarily, it definitely amped up how intimidating he can be, but he was already plenty intimidating from episode 3. I know one of the big points people say in favor of LOK is that all the villains have a point, and while I can analyze the series and say ""yeah, the equalists are onto something,"" I think it's important for Amon to really challenge Korra about it, not just scare her."

982,2020-08-19 22:46:44,ib3egw,>!Makes sense. Although onto that point I always thought Amon put too much into Republic City. There's still the rest of the world to rid of bending lmao.!<
983,2020-08-19 21:23:05,ib3egw,"I can’t say when either. I was about to tell you that Aang actually does almost the exact same brutal wall slam as the task force when he’s fighting Zuko in episode 1 or 2, but I just rewatched it, and he was actually doing it with a mattress instead of the floor lol. My brain was definitely still telling me that Toph was killing people the first time we see her fight though."

994,2020-08-19 23:21:48,ib3egw,">!Yeah it’s a little over ambitious, but maybe he thought that the idea would take off. There’s certainly a lot of people in the Earth Kingdom who feel oppressed.!<"
995,2020-08-19 21:27:13,ib3egw,I'm curious to know how much force the human body in the Avatar universe can take. It's a bit different in the Kyoshi books. There's lots of blood and precise points of pressure can penetrate the body quite easily (which obviously they couldn't show on television).

1107,2020-08-09 12:03:36,i695cc,James Hong is an institution. I’m glad that Asian American actors are supporting each other in the entertainment industry.
1108,2020-08-09 15:27:57,i695cc,They just hit their goal and GoFundMe isn’t taking new donations..
1109,2020-08-09 05:30:50,i695cc,He should replace the racist monument honoring Trump...it’s time for all monuments to hate to be replaced...
1110,2020-08-09 15:13:43,i695cc,Update: [goal reached](https://www.gofundme.com/f/lets-get-james-hong-a-star-on-the-walk-of-fame)! Looks like fundraiser has been closed to further donations. Congratulations to anyone who may have contributed after reading the article!

1113,2020-08-09 03:39:07,i695cc,I think he has the most roles in movies and tv shows out of all Hollywood actors. I could be wrong though.
1114,2020-08-09 04:50:07,i695cc,Thank you Mr. Gat
1115,2020-08-09 05:31:12,i695cc,That episode of lost with the chicken I think and him talking perfect English still haunts me to this day 😅
1116,2020-08-09 10:00:28,i695cc,Saw James Hong at a Star Trek convention years ago. He taught my dad how to burp on command. What a great guy.  He totally deserves this.
1117,2020-08-09 02:21:53,i695cc,Let’s do this! Just donated!!! #representationmatters This man is a legend
1118,2020-08-09 03:15:31,i695cc,Poor guy almost married Ida!!

1121,2020-08-09 04:13:42,i695cc,CARTWRIGHT! FOUR!
1122,2020-08-09 04:18:01,i695cc,"His role in Balls of furry alone, make him deserving🤣"
1123,2020-08-09 04:36:27,i695cc,He doesn’t have a star yet‽
1124,2020-08-09 05:08:32,i695cc,The most under appreciated actor in Hollywood
1125,2020-08-09 05:26:57,i695cc,Wow I assumed he would have had one already. Get this man a star!
1126,2020-08-09 05:27:21,i695cc,Put me down for a yes.
1127,2020-08-09 05:32:15,i695cc,"Love James Hong, he deserves it if not just from his massive body of work"

1129,2020-08-09 05:54:56,i695cc,Absolutely deserves a star- Legend. He’s been in so much
1130,2020-08-09 05:56:35,i695cc,The guy is in everything under the 🌞
1131,2020-08-09 06:10:04,i695cc,Seinfeld! Party of 4!
1132,2020-08-09 06:13:43,i695cc,"I'm shocked he didn't already have one, wow."
1133,2020-08-09 06:21:39,i695cc,So pissed to learn that he doesn’t already have one.
1134,2020-08-09 06:29:51,i695cc,I am shocked to hear that he doesn’t have one
1135,2020-08-09 06:41:16,i695cc,Serious question: where would these funds be used to get someone considered? Is there a “Hollywood walk of fame” lobby group of some kind ? Or can you just pay for your own star?
1136,2020-08-09 06:55:41,i695cc,Correct me if I’m wrong but was it Daniel Dae Kim that played dr Han in the good doctor
1137,2020-08-09 07:45:08,i695cc,His fight scene in Wayne's World 2 was great.
1138,2020-08-09 08:04:17,i695cc,Cartwright! Party of four!
1139,2020-08-09 08:06:21,i695cc,Fighting the important fight.
1140,2020-08-09 08:55:13,i695cc,How the hell does James Hong not already have a star? Dude's been in like *all the movies*?!?
1141,2020-08-09 09:31:31,i695cc,I love James Hong
1142,2020-08-09 09:41:20,i695cc,His bit in waynes world 2 was great.
1143,2020-08-09 11:10:16,i695cc,Plot Twist:  James Hog is Daniel Dae Kim’s future self.
1144,2020-08-09 11:20:50,i695cc,"I grew up watching James Hong. He definitely deserves a star and that was before I knew how many acting credits he has.

I didn’t know the actor had to pay for his/her own star. Huh, you learn something new every day."
1145,2020-08-09 11:21:31,i695cc,Nice idea but Hong’s so prolific I hope we can do better than just a star.  Ideas?
1146,2020-08-09 11:27:55,i695cc,"James Hong is brilliant!!  Dude has such an amazing portfolio of movies.

(Hope you’re reading this James)"
1147,2020-08-09 11:57:56,i695cc,James Hong doesn’t have a star!? Wth is the world coming to?
1148,2020-08-09 12:59:13,i695cc,Don’t you just pay for one of those ?
1149,2020-08-09 13:21:39,i695cc,"Why doesn’t he have one already? James Hong is an amazing actor with a more diverse filmography than most, he can act circles around most anyone and steals every scene he is in. Donating now."
1150,2020-08-09 13:26:05,i695cc,How does he not have a star?!?
1151,2020-08-09 13:43:26,i695cc,James Hong deserves the star ⭐️! He should have received it a long time ago
1152,2020-08-09 13:44:52,i695cc,He was booger’s guru in Revenge of the Nerds 2...what a great scene
1153,2020-08-09 13:45:08,i695cc,Amazing as Cassandra’s dad in Wayne’s World 2
1154,2020-08-09 14:07:50,i695cc,Hawaii five o man
1155,2020-08-09 14:09:09,i695cc,James Hong is the original Shang Tsung!!
1156,2020-08-09 14:25:08,i695cc,"I’d sign this. James Hong has been in so much, it’s the least Hollywood could do."
1157,2020-08-09 14:26:32,i695cc,"One of those actors anyone would recognize the voice of but seldom knows their name. Younger people would know him from
King Fu Panda as Po’s adoptive duck father. He’s got range too. He was actually kinda scary in Safe."
1158,2020-08-09 14:32:41,i695cc,"My grandma was buds with him in high school . Their names were really close so they always sat near each other. He asked her to prom but she already had a date. Damn, would’ve been a very cool story and probably a super fun night for her."
1159,2020-08-09 15:30:50,i695cc,"This guy has been in everything, from Kung fu panda, regular show, documentaries about Ghengis Khan, even Black ops 2"
1160,2020-08-09 15:36:50,i695cc,"Well this man is indeed a legend!

1165,2020-08-09 16:31:31,i695cc,"I've watched James Hong for over 60 years on TV & movies.

James Hong is deserving of a star on The Walk of Fame"
1166,2020-08-09 16:33:50,i695cc,"He’ll probably get his star in five, ten minutes."
1167,2020-08-09 16:48:20,i695cc,He doesn't have one?!? Man's been in 75% of my fave movies and always good!
1168,2020-08-09 17:04:22,i695cc,"Hell Yes. That man deserves one more than 1/3 of those who already have them.
So underrated. James Hong Rocks..."

1170,2020-08-09 18:02:31,i695cc,Loved him in R.I.P.D.
1171,2020-08-09 18:28:49,i695cc,The hardest working actor that is very under depreciated. His work spans for a very long time.In rules Rolls that he played for jokes and a living.
1172,2020-08-09 19:10:28,i695cc,"On top of his on-screen career, he’s one of those maybe 5 voice actors (like Phil Lamar or Billy West) whose name you might not know all that well if you never really paid attention to the credits, but he’s done at least one voice on at least one episode of almost literally every cartoon you watched as a kid."
1173,2020-08-09 20:33:08,i695cc,Wasn’t James Hong in “Big Trouble In Little China”? Classic movie!
1174,2020-08-09 20:47:24,i695cc,More like Daniel Bae Kim
1175,2020-08-09 22:30:06,i695cc,"James Hong has a net worth of almost $10 millon. If he wanted a star, he would already have a star."

1181,2020-08-09 03:30:47,i695cc,The man deserves it! A truly under-appreciated actor!
1182,2020-08-09 04:29:51,i695cc,The fact that he doesn't have one at this point is ridiculous dudes an amazing actor and is iconic.
1183,2020-08-09 06:11:40,i695cc,Can’t believe 50 cent has a star and James doesn’t.
1184,2020-08-09 06:32:13,i695cc,I’m literally watching The West Wing and he appeared as I scrolled past this post. I had to go look it up on IMDb just to make sure I wasn’t crazy 😳
1185,2020-08-09 03:01:50,i695cc,"He'll get one in 5, 10 minutes."
1186,2020-08-09 04:10:33,i695cc,just pay for it!!!!!!!!!!!!

1203,2020-08-09 12:11:12,i695cc,"Its because he’s asian, hollywood thinks ppl dont care about asians. Noone talks about hollywood racism against asians. I dont see many brown ppl either, so im sure there is racism there too."
1204,2020-08-09 12:13:06,i695cc,"You pay $ to have the star. It is not ""awarded"" to anyone. Vince McMahon of the WWE bought himself one a few years ago."

1206,2020-08-09 12:52:13,i695cc,"Why not get him an honour that means something? 
Any no talent Schmuck with the $ can get a star on the walk of fame. Cameron Diaz has one for Christ’s sake."
1207,2020-08-09 13:58:02,i695cc,I enjoyed watching him on an episode of King of Queens. Where Doug and his friends rented an apartment above his restaurant👩🏽‍🦱

1212,2020-08-09 15:11:13,i695cc,"Between him and Al Leung, they were seemingly in every single thing I watched from the late 70s to around 2000."
1213,2020-08-09 15:12:32,i695cc,James Hong should absolutely have that star. Great actor and so many great performances.
1214,2020-08-09 17:39:12,i695cc,"(Rhetorical question):


Why did i see the background behind James Hong (bc i saw the picture first) and immediately start thinking about something to do with China and RDR2 being banned by the government or the copyright to it being bought out by a Chinese company?"
1215,2020-08-09 18:05:37,i695cc,He needs money to do this?
1216,2020-08-09 19:51:02,i695cc,They should instead get him a female hooker this time

1234,2020-08-09 22:59:04,i695cc,"30,000-35,000 should do it. Celebrities actually purchase their stars on the Hollywood walk of fame."

James Hong is a gem and highly deserves to have his props."

1241,2020-08-10 00:00:23,i695cc,James Hong has been so good for so long. He deserves a star or two!

1244,2020-08-10 01:24:08,i695cc,It’s a no brainer for him to have a star.
1245,2020-08-10 02:02:20,i695cc,40k is only 0.004% of his 10 million net worth...why ask us poor people to fund something that he can easily do on his own...why should we pay for something hollywood related!!!!!!!!!! and he’ll get the credit for not contributing anything!!!!!!!
1246,2020-08-10 03:29:32,i695cc,I love James Hong
1247,2020-08-10 04:33:36,i695cc,"Why doesn't Daniel Dae Kim buy it for him? People can't exactly donate right now

1251,2020-08-11 04:28:26,i695cc,Hong was great in Big Trouble in Little China.
1252,2020-08-11 18:25:42,i695cc,James Hong is a treasure.
1253,2020-08-12 18:35:14,i695cc,"I was coming in here to say that Daniel needed to do something more with his life than to get someone a star on a fucking sidewalk. That’s stupid as fuck. I hate Hollywood anyways. Smells like piss. Hate going there. But James is a fucking national treasure and we better give him everything he deserves. Fuckin man is one, if not THE hardest working actor in Hollywood. Dude is in everything and still active. Dude in 90 years with work still in post. He even hits all the cons. A fuckin’ legend which I had the pleasure to meet multiple times."
1254,2020-08-13 12:16:14,i695cc,Both are fucking legend
1255,2020-08-14 08:18:09,i695cc,His smallish role in Blade Runner as the lab creator of replicant eyes was brilliant

1259,2020-08-09 12:57:11,i695cc,Lmao what an embarrassment. Need to pay to place a star? Lol.
1260,2020-08-09 19:41:27,i695cc,"Daniel Dae Kim is worth over 10 million dollars. He can find 50K in his sock drawer.  In fact he would be earning around 50K / month from interest.

I don't really grock why he is asking us to donate to this, if he wants to give the guy a star, give him a star. I'm not going to pay for it..."
1261,2020-08-09 03:56:41,i695cc,He deserves a star. Daniel Dae Kim should buy it... why fundraise?
1262,2020-08-09 06:43:22,i695cc,"I would think Daniel Dae Kim has the money to pay for this. No need of a Go Found Me. If he really wanna do it, just do it."

1264,2020-08-09 11:58:30,i695cc,Me from Adelaide South Australia. Yes I know him. James Hong is a star to me. He doesn’t need a 💫 for me to remember him. I’ll never walk down that street anyway.
1265,2020-08-09 02:48:34,i695cc,Watching Lost I was thinking Daniel Dae Kim looks like the perfect human.

1267,2020-08-09 12:39:36,i695cc,Guy looks like handsome squidward.

Hope he gets it, definitely deserves it."
1281,2020-08-09 03:49:46,i695cc,Such an amazing movie for so many reasons.
1282,2020-08-09 04:59:00,i695cc,Possibly my most favoritest movie.

1284,2020-08-09 05:00:02,i695cc,"The second sentence is factually incorrect. While he may have 600 credits, there are actors that have more credits.
 
 I am just counting what shows up on IMDb.com . Ron Jeremy comes in at 1500+.

Still one of my favorite burns of all time."
1286,2020-08-09 03:45:59,i695cc,The star isn’t really an award. It’s a purchase decision made usually by a producer or representative from the company that puts these stars all over Hollywood Blvd.  it’s a paid for publicity event.
1287,2020-08-09 06:05:20,i695cc,TIL. The character he played in Blade Runner was called Dr. Hannibal Chew 😉
1288,2020-08-09 17:52:11,i695cc,The star is meaningless. not sure why anyone cares.  Donate to something more important.

1291,2020-08-09 05:37:32,i695cc,Done.  Happy to donate.  Good luck Mr. Kim and Mr. Hong!

1293,2020-08-09 15:00:06,i695cc,"Donated! Brought it up to 54,500!"
1294,2020-08-09 03:54:04,i695cc,"Wow 439 roles spread across film, tv, and video games.  I didn't see any radio specifically, but I'm sure he's been on some radio drama or something."
1295,2020-08-09 03:57:40,i695cc,"My gosh! Also learned how many remakes/reboots of modern tv and film there are, he’s been in the OG’s!"
1296,2020-08-09 04:57:25,i695cc,"I like how Hong always shows up in cool movies.  Sometimes only small parts, but he is always there.  For example, he was in the background as one of the scientists in one of my personal sci-fi cult faves, Colossus: The Forbin Project."
1297,2020-08-09 02:41:30,i695cc,“Cartwright 4!”

A “star”.  Indeed."
1319,2020-08-09 19:46:06,i695cc,Yeah. So anyone who wants a Hollywood Walk of Fame Star needs to pay for it 🤣

1342,2020-08-09 04:14:54,i695cc,It's closer to 600 when you count the shows where he's played multiple characters. :-) I'm guessing the man is super easy to work with and has a very good agent.

1345,2020-08-09 04:56:25,i695cc,You’re combing two scenes from the episode! Cartwright is Constanza when the phone call was for him! But stil lmafaooo
1346,2020-08-09 15:55:41,i695cc,And it wasn’t liked by the critics because it stayed in the same setting the whole show. I think it was an amazing episode.

1388,2020-08-09 18:31:09,i695cc,"I am totally biased because Voyager was the first series I watched all the way through as it was on air when I was a kid and I used to watch it after school, but yes, you should rewatch it. 

I’ve rewatched the series 20+ times since I was 10, I’m 30 now and I still absolutely love it. I just finished Workforce: Part II and cried so hard at the goodbye between Janeway and Jaffen, Kate brought such an emotional depth to her character and will forever be my favourite Captain."
1389,2020-08-09 15:55:42,i695cc,"His version of the thing is what made me fall in love with practical effects. I remember seeing the part with the head sprouting legs and my jaw hit the floor and it still sticks with me to this day. It was like a magic trick where I couldnt stop thinking about how they did it.


I'm not a purist but practical will always be my preference because of stuff like this. Cgi is amazing when used correctly and definitely made some of my favorite movies possible but it will never hold up to the effects that I grew up with."

1392,2020-08-09 22:45:52,i695cc,Yeah I stopped watching after he and Grace Park left.
1393,2020-08-09 17:52:12,i695cc,Well...practical done well... Re-animator and Scanners haven’t really held up. John Carpenter is just exceptional at his craft.

1395,2020-08-09 17:56:07,i695cc,"I guess that's a matter of opinion I just watched re-animator and I thoroughly enjoyed the effects still.  I definetly agree they dont look nearly as good as modern effects but just personally I still enjoy the shittier looking practical. 

It's probably a combination of the charm of it and the fact that I tend to get an uncanny valley sense pretty easily with all but the best cgi. Imo the best way to do it is to blend the two like the first Jurassic park or mad max fury road. Practical effects as a baseline and then use cgi to enhance it and fix the rough edges. Like I said tho just my opinion I definitely could see preferring modern better looking effects."
1396,2020-08-09 17:58:02,i695cc,Correct. Alien for example is AMAZING and came out like 40+ years ago. When you go full CGI it never ages well.
1397,2020-08-09 18:00:29,i695cc,Alien and aliens are perfect examples in my opinion hell it's better for lower budget movies too I rewatched repo man last night and it's not the most effects heavy movie but I think the practical effects worked perfectly hell the fact they looked a little cheap fit the movie more than if like the Malibu was done with glossy computer animation

When you play a role like Namor, it's going to require extensive fight and stunt sequences, it's going to require wire work, it's going to require shirtless scenes. Even healing takes longer. A 30 year old who sprains his ankle is going to recover better than a 60 year old."

Though, people always ask stuff like “why aren’t they on the Hollywood Walk of Fame?” And realistically, it’s often because of the $50k application fee. Not that $50k is _expensive_ for most people in a position to be nominated for it, it just seems like... not worth it IMO, lol, and also not really much of an “honor” with such a steep fee just to _apply_.  That said, hope the GoFundMe reaches its goal."

1435,2020-08-04 13:52:37,i3de6k,"They did a great job of making him unappealing to begin with and then doing a 180. He was angry and borderline abusive, he wanted he and Sun to be separate from the rest, and it didn't help that he couldn't speak English so we weren't really getting to know him.

Then we find out that he has a really, really nice dad. That he grew up in poverty, that he really loved Sun, and that he was trapped by her father into doing things he genuinely didn't want to do. And once he started helping with the raft and making the effort to communicate with the other survivors, he became really endearing.

One of my favourite moments is when he and Sawyer find each other in 'This Place Is Death' and they're [just so overjoyed to be reunited.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsiR2G1cC5g)"

The scene at the end of Season 1, when Sun gives Jin some English words for him to learn while he's on the raft, man...all the feels."

Imagine having to go through what everybody else did on that show, with the addition of nit being to communicate to them and talk through Sun. 

They did such a great job in creating his character, making him seem like a bad guy in the beginning but allowing him to have the best redemption arch

1452,2020-08-04 14:21:29,i3de6k,"One of the things I love about the show is the quiet lessons it taught about the complexity of the human condition, and our propensity for digging only to surface level before giving someone a label and dismissing the possibility that they could be anything else. (ex: the “entitled selfish brat”, “drug addict”, “Iraqi terrorist”, etc).  All people have a story, and got where they are and became who they are for a reason.

Now Miles on the other hand... I hate Miles.  He's just so toxic and angry all the time, it bugs me to no end."

25% of the primetime cast was asian (along with several replacement hosts and longtime cast members who werent white)... 

g4 is a tech focused network - a foodie/comedy skit show doesnt fit that segment

the network needs a show to appeal to a broad audience in order to stay in business via ad revenue - shows that single out a particular ethnic group are probably unsustainable"

1507,2020-10-08 21:27:55,j7ltf5,"Here's my take.

Hollywood is all about the money.  If the producers think they can pay an actor less they will, regardless of race.  

The 'Friends' cast got lots of money by simply banding together and refusing to negotiate individually.  The producers might have been able to drop one or two of the cast but not all six."
1508,2020-10-08 22:07:39,j7ltf5,"The more important characters get paid more money than less important characters. Screen time + importance to the show = more money. Race is not a factor. Like, if Morgan freeman is the lead actor in a film, he'll definitely be paid more than a non lead actor."

They weren't leads on that show, but wanted to be paid as leads. But also keep their lighter schedules as non-leads have (which lets them do other projects).

The show went on a few more seasons and years without them: proof they were expendable. The show eventually stopped because one of the actual leads said he was done (I believe Alex O'Loughlin said his body wasn't able to keep it up).

IMHO Daniel Dae Kim was ripe for a spinoff if he had played his cards right. He got greedy and it blew up in his face. They could have totally written an ending which would lead into that. He could have pulled it off, he could have piggybacked off the existing audience and been part of the Lenkov tropical universe. As a fan favorite in an existing popular universe of shows he could have easily done a few seasons and pull in a serious paycheck.

Most TV actors would kill for that opportunity. Rather than start from nothing he'd get the upper hand with a budget, high starting pay, experienced team, and an audience already interested. All things any new show on TV has to develop against the clock of an impatient network."

Same for other people. They don't go by these names, but Wikipedia includes their ""unofficial"" Hanzi name to let more people know who that person is."
1546,2020-09-20 23:44:47,iwlfgg,"There is nothing wrong with that.    Form people who have names in Chinese, like Jeremy Lin, whether he is a ROC citizen or not, using the name in Chinese in Chinese texts is authentic and accurate.  The name in the dominant context for the person as Jeremy Lin in US, thus in English, should be noted.   

For people from countries whose name can be written in Chinese characters as per the mapping from the original language, the usage of the name in Chinese characters are also authentic and accurate.   This applies to Korean and Vietnamese.  For Japanese, not all Japanese can be mapped to Kanji, but Japanese people require that the names must be in Kanji.   Then, all Japanese names can be written in Chinese characters too.

There is nothing wrong with written Chinese in Chinese articles.   

Names via translation by sound are only for languages that had no way to map to Chinese characters, example, Russian, Arabic or English.  For East Asian countries this is not the case.

The same that you cannot demand that English Wikipedia only uses Chinese names to refer to people in China."
1547,2020-09-21 01:28:45,iwlfgg,"Chinese characters are not necessarily Chinese, the same as Latin characters not Latin. If a foreigner has a formal name consisting of Chinese characters (maybe not legal name e.g. 陆克文 洪博培), that would be how he or she is named in China.

In fact, it's transformed to Chinese characters in their own language, and Mandarin wiki picks the characters directly, just like English wiki picks the same spelling of French. To be more specific:

instead of Korean -> Chinese -> Hanzi

it's more like:

Korean -> [Hanja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanja) -> Hanzi

Japanese -> [Kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji) -> Hanzi

The pronunciation is independent of the writing form (Chinese, Korean, Japanese, hundreds of Chinese dialects). You should call the name of exactly same characters with different pronunciation depending on the language you are speaking.

Update: Because some Japanese Kanji characters don't exist in Chinese, China even published official rules how to pronounce them in order to borrow these characters directly (especially for names)."

My ROC passport has my Chinese name because the ROC government asked for my Chinese name when applying.

Sometimes I joke around with my Chinese friends by introducing myself with the Chinese character phonetics of my English name.

But to answer your question Chinese American parents give ABC both English names (aka ""Government Name"") and Chinese names at birth."

1581,2020-09-11 02:44:12,iqf6v4,"Just my personal opinion, but the more specific the character, the less likely people are to forgive you if you cast inaccurately. For example, a Chinese character with very specifically Chinese experiences should be played by a Chinese actor. 

To address some of your examples, Naomi Scott is not Arab, and she was cast in a very Arabian story. Apparently, Sakina Jaffrey is Indian, so I mean, there's an obvious cultural disconnect between her and a presumably Latina character. And Henry Golding, well I think that controversy might've just been because lots of Asians were (apparently) tired of seeing half-white people constantly cast as full Asian main characters.

I don't think Ben Daimio required much cultural nuance, since Hellboy was focused on the character of Hellboy. And it doesn't matter anyway since, like, no one went to see the movie lmao. Regarding Randall Park as Louis, I'd say that Fresh Off the Boat honestly became a generic sitcom with a mildly Chinese aesthetic, so accurate casting didn't matter too much to people when they lost interest. And also, people were willing to forgive since it was the first all-Asian-American show we had in more than two decades.

Still, try to be as accurate as possible. It does make a difference, which, while subtle, will make your character better. While people could get away with casting any Asian for a specifically, say, Japanese character before (and so on for other ethnic groups), people are a lot more aware of these things now. But if you're a small production and can't find any accurate actors, well, some things can be forgiven--just make sure the writing's not racist. And don't cast a white person to play your ethnic characters.

TL;DR: People will be more forgiving of inaccurate casting if the character is less tied to their culture, but PLEASE do your best to cast someone who's part of your character's culture."
1582,2020-09-11 05:36:27,iqf6v4,"I think your last paragraph hits the nail on the head. This is tricky, but you have to ask yourself the tough question of ""does it matter?""  And I don't say that flippantly. For some characters it really doesn't matter and for other roles it matters a bunch.

It's one of those things where the rules are just nebulous because at the end of the day these are all actors portraying other people, most of which are fictitious (and often from fictitious places). And when we're making a movie we want to do it in a way where the actor disappears and the character comes through. And that justifies, for example not having a white character play a person of color if its unnecessary because it just calls attention to the actor not the character and often in a condescending way (see Mickey Rooney in *Breakfast at Tiffany's*). So I think to the degree that you would want to portray other aspects of your film honestly (locations, sets, costuming, etc) to tell a convincing story, then that should extend to your casting as well.

I think its not so much a double standard with white actors (to me that's a superficial and lazy read of the situation) so much as there's just a lot less thin slicing and cultural sensibilities with portrayals white characters because there's basically no agreement on what white is. So you can just get away with more in ways that you can't get away with identifiably ethnic actors. Quentin Tarantino made an entire movie about this with *Inglourious Basterds* where characters can effortless move in and out of ethnicities just by changing their accent and mannerisms.The concept of 'white' itself is flimsy and superficial (meaning roughly of European descent, but that could extend to cultures as varied as Iceland or South Africa). So who really is to say that Kenneth Branagh can't portray a Russian in *Tenet*? Or Liam Neeson playing Oskar Schindler? Who's to say Margot Robbie doesn't have British ancestry? Australian is a nationality not an ethnicity and certainly not a race. I mean by that standard no non-American should ever portray Americans and then we'd rob David Oyelowo, who is British of Nigerian descent, of his magnificent portrayal of Martin Luther King (who was neither) in *Selma*. Or Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker. Or basically Mike Myers in the entire *Austin Powers* trilogy. Are we really going to deny Patrick Stewart, a knighted Briton playing a Frenchman in *Star Trek: The Next Generation* (with a British accent no less, which when you think about it is absurd casting and yet no one cared)?

There are some times though where suspension of disbelief is hurt because of the actor's real life. For me personally, Neil Patrick Harris is not convincing in *Gone Girl* as an example (but I'm not sure if that's because everyone knows he's gay or if because I'm half expecting him to break out in a production number at the Tony's). Kevin Spacey's southern accent in *House of Cards* is ridiculous and thoroughly unconvincing, and yet he's so strong in nailing the essence of the character you overlook it. There are some actors for whom being gay matters not at all in their portrayals like Spacey or Zack Galifinakis, for example, and others like Neil Patrick Harris who can't seem to escape their real life even on screen. So its a case by case thing.

With people of color the differences run deeper. Japanese culture and Korean culture are nothing alike. An African-American and someone from Belize only share skin color (and maybe distant genealogy) in common. The differences are also more meaningful. Black people really do often stratify themselves based on how light or dark their skin is (high-yellow or redbone vs chocolate or brown-skin) and often mainstream white culture is ignorant of these little cultural quirks, so when someone that black people think of as a dark skin person is played by someone with more caramel or lighter skin, to black people that reads as false, even if whites don't perceive the importance of the difference. So a lot of it is just educating yourself as to the nuances of the culture you are trying to portray, which should help make you a more exposed, cosmopolitan and well-rounded person.

Casting is the hardest nut to crack when it comes with how movies deal with race and ethnicity because casting is by its nature not inclusive. It's the definition of exclusive. And beyond the superficialities of an actor's background, a director is much more interested in that person's acting ability, how easy they are to work with and if they're marketable, which is why you'll see Jamie Foxx playing Ray Charles or Will Smith playing Muhammad Ali, when on the surface they don't seem to be 1:1 accurate fits, but more like soft impressions. They're sort of portraying a figure as we remember them not as they actually are, and there's an argument to be made that perhaps this is a better approach anyway.

So I think for me, you have to ask the hard question of ""does it matter?"" Sometimes the answer is no (replacing Denzel Washington with Will Smith in *Training Day* probably wouldn't alter the movie much). But sometimes the answer is ""yea, we better get this right."" And to answer that question requires humility, and wisdom and seeking out advice and knowledge. It's no different than writing a screenplay. You want to write about the CIA, then you need to do your research. You want to make a movie where race or ethnicity is an overt theme, then you best do your homework."
1583,2020-09-11 03:01:00,iqf6v4,"Thanks for the in depth reply. You make a great point in that the more a character is tied to their cultural experiences, the more imperative accurate casting is - I hadn't thought of it that way. But yes, obviously one should try their best whatever the scenario.

I also imagine the scarcity of roles just adds pressure and scrutiny that may not exist if things were more equally distributed. For example, as a gay man I wouldn't have any issue with straight actors playing gay roles in an ideal world, but with so few to go around currently it is frustrating to see them consistently taken by heterosexual performers.

As for white actors playing ethnic characters...I sincerely hope those days are over. But [apparently not](https://whitetribalchief.wordpress.com/2013/05/19/the-story/)."
1584,2020-09-11 10:35:55,iqf6v4,"You dropped some info that took me by surprise and I had to google it, turns out Zack Galifinakis isn't gay, idk where you got that from."
1585,2020-09-11 21:32:40,iqf6v4,"Thanks for the reply, good points all round! I too was surprised by Zack Galifinakis until I Wikipedia'd him haha. You're right I guess, 'white' culture isn't as broadly agreed upon or stratified as other ethnicities, which unfortunately makes it trickier for POC. Bankability is another good point, again a vicious self-perpetuating cycle which isn't helped by the lack of non-white big name stars. See [Ridley Scott's comments](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/ridley-scott-on-exodus-gods-and-kings-casting-im-not-going-to-get-it-financed-if-my-lead-actor-is-9885345.html) on casting for Exodus.

Interesting take on Neil Patrick Harris et al - personally I found him believable as heterosexual in Gone Girl and How I Met Your Mother, but I know what you mean. I wonder why we can readily believe straight actors playing gay but have a harder time when the tables are turned."
1586,2020-09-11 17:04:10,iqf6v4,That’s my bad. I could’ve swore he came out but when I looked it up apparently he came out as a joke on Bill Maher’s show and it was taken as real. All these years I thought he was gay.
1587,2020-09-11 21:58:16,iqf6v4,">Bankability is another good point, again a vicious self-perpetuating cycle which isn't helped by the lack of non-white big name stars.

Well there's also this weird propensity for POC and women to be erased if it is politically expedient. What I mean by this is when you take a movie like *Black Panther* and everyone in the media is swooning saying ""finally a black hero"" or say Daisy Ridley in Star Wars and its like ""finally a sci-fi female lead!"" And it's like ""but what about Sigourney Weaver in Alien?"" or ""Avery Brooks cast as the lead on Deep Space Nine,"" or ""Will Smith in like every movie he's ever been in?"" or ""Angelina Jolie in every movie she's been in?"" Or Wesley Snipes as the original Blade. So there's this convoluted paradoxical thing where it always seems like minorities and women are in a casting deficit because people sort of deliberately have a short term memory in order to make a point about minorities and women not being cast, even when there's a bit of evidence either to the contrary or that complicates the argument. It then doesn't help long-term bankability if your actors can't stay relevant longer than a decade or so because its not politically expedient.

I don't know how common it really is to see straight actors playing gay characters (or gay characters in general, so there might just be a limited sample size). I've noticed when this happens it tends to be situations like Philip Seymour Hoffman playing Truman Capote or maybe Robin Williams in The Birdcage, which in both cases I think the strength of the actor is what led to them being cast over their own personal story. I think what would be more interesting is if a gay man was cast as the next Bond while keeping the character straight. Would audiences suspend their disbelief? Good question and its probably dependent on the actor. We had no problem with Jonathan Groff in Mindhunter or Ian McKellen playing Magneto (but again Magneto's sexuality never really matters much either)."
1588,2020-09-11 22:30:22,iqf6v4,"Good point, I do remember people pointing out that Wesley Snipes had played Blade when Black Panther was hailed as the first black superhero. Maybe it's also because there tend to be extended lulls wherein there are few to no blockbuster films featuring black or female protagonists, so people forget that such movies have in fact come before. Meanwhile in the interim we have had a countless supply of white, male, cis-het actors carrying franchises on repeat.

To your point about straight actors playing gay, a few recent examples that spring to mind (that were still undoubtedly great performances) would be Annette Bening and Julianne Moore in The Kids Are Alright, Darren Criss in American Crime Story and Mahershala Ali in Green Book. The [trailer for Stage Mom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFlCsRETeQs) also shows Adrian Grenier as one of the gay protagonists. Again, in an ideal world with equal opportunites for actors I personally wouldn't care; as it is would probably feel uncomfortable asking about someone's sexuality during casting - but it is still frustrating to continually witness this take place. However I would love to see a gay actor play James Bond. Not the best analogy, but taking from the rich to give to the poor is fine, but the reverse...not so much."
1589,2020-09-09 16:56:31,iphj8j,"The whole ""who can play who"" debate is a strange one. While I agree that it's wrong to have white people play every part, it's somehow okay for Al Pacino to play a Hispanic character in Scarface or a Jewish/Israeli guy in Hunters. Antonio Banderas can play anybody from Europe/the Americas so long as they speak Spanish. 

And now the LGBTQ are getting offended if a gay character isn't portrayed by a gay actor (never mind that gay or bi men play straight characters all the time).

I think at the end of the day, the Asian American community just wants to be treated with the same casting standard as the rest of Hollywood. So when a Japanese guy gets portrayed by a Korean actor or a Chinese guy is played by a hapa actor, it's about as accurate as when Anne Hathaway pretends to be British or Australian Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine the Canadian."
1590,2020-09-09 16:07:10,iphj8j,I dont really think it should matter as long as he does a good job.
1591,2020-09-09 16:06:09,iphj8j,[removed]
1592,2020-09-10 01:04:04,iphj8j,"Very interesting point. I think societal norms definitely skew the line of what’s right and wrong.
I don’t think it’s inherently wrong for one person to imitate/impersonate someone from another ethnicity if it’s done respectfully. I think in casting, the important thing would be to cast someone who can capture the essence of the character they’re portraying. So casting a white actor for a Japanese character wouldn’t really make sense because you can tell by looking at the dude that he’s not Japanese. But a Korean man would have a much easier time convincing the audience that he’s a Japanese man. Of course it depends on the role too. It would be less appropriate if a Korean actor was cast in a biopic of a famous Japanese man, because the accuracy of the ethnicity of the actor required for the role would be more important. I don’t think a Korean actor playing a Japanese character is inherently offensive, but it reflects very poorly on the director/producer’s original casting and the industry in general."
1593,2020-09-10 13:12:42,iphj8j,"It’s not as offensive as the other way around because Korea/China never invaded Japan within last 100 years and mass rape and killed their people. Also there’s still a lab in China you can visit to see “experiments” Japanese scientists tried on everyday people. 

I’m guessing if it was the other way around people would be more upset."
1594,2020-09-11 03:40:04,iphj8j,I am also interested how these roles happen
1595,2020-09-13 21:50:18,iphj8j,"It's an American movie made in America. The vast majority of Americans cannot/do not distinguish a Korean American actor playing a Japanese part. IMO, it's a big step that they even cast an Asian actor."
1596,2020-10-02 15:45:14,iphj8j,"well, personally I don't really see your point. we see constantly British actors ex. tom holland playing American roles. seems to be the same to me?"
1597,2020-09-09 19:41:53,iphj8j,"I mean, the distinction seems pretty obvious here... with Ed Skrein, it would be a white person doing yellow-face, or removing an Asian character altogether."
1598,2020-09-09 16:27:51,iphj8j,Should Tom Hardy step down for playing an American character in Venom?
1599,2020-09-09 21:29:46,iphj8j,"Personally, I was ""fine"" cause Daniel Dae Kim was realistically the closest we would get to a Japanese actor in the role. He's one of the biggest and most recognizable Asian American actors so they were counting on him for name recognition and sadly, no Japanese American actor is big enough for Hollywood. (Which has its own can of worms concerning Hollywood's reluctance to outright refusal to cast Asiant actors in any roles).

It still sucks how Hollywood still shuns Asian American actors and roles, but the only reason we even got a Korean American actor was cause the outrage and the original actor stepping down. It was as good as we were going to get at the moment. And personally, I'm just so sick of roles being whitewashed that I was happy that an Asian American actor as great as Daniel Dae Kim got the part.

I just got so tired of speaking out against all the different incidents of whitewashing Asian roles and Asian culture that I was just relieved at the smallest possible step forward."
1600,2020-09-09 16:09:24,iphj8j,Overall I'd agree with that. I just find it odd that there was zero backlash to Kim being...I don't know...'close enough' I suppose.

1607,2020-11-02 13:46:04,jm9wki,"ooh KNK! I was first introduced to them via MixNine (truly, the show that made me feel saddest about everyone who competed), though I don't really remember the specific members who had competed. they were always that group that I heard was very talented but never quite gained traction despite having good music. 

I really enjoy the Rain performance video, where you can really see how they creatively use those umbrellas. I don't know their names too well but I love when one member walks forward surrounded by umbrellas and there are two swishing in front of him like car windshields on a rainy day. I found that *so* creative. 

The song is also really good, it's literally the perfect song to listen on a melancholic rainy day where you just wanna stare at a rainy window like the protagonist of your own sad indie film lol"
1608,2020-11-02 05:39:28,jm9wki,"Thanks for the write up! Really surprised Cube thought a vocal girl-group would work, considering very few of them have succeeded in the past decade (at least in my memory). 

[I'll opt out]

edit: oops I meant ballad girl groups, there are a couple of popular vocal groups :~)"
1609,2020-11-02 16:45:02,jm9wki,"I found KNK when they released Sunset & I was mind blown. Its such a beautiful song. It's sad they have so less views & fans as they are amazing artists. Also Seoham & Jackson wang are friends also got me hyped about the group as Jackson is my ult. bias. Ride is also an amazing song which again so less views is heart breaking. And the average height of the group is same as me (6'2) which is also kinda cool to me lol. 

I found Kiara on reddit & following her since her debut. She is really good & gorgeous. Idk much about her tho.

I've heard about ATTA. I guess i havent checked them out. Thanks for the heads up. 

I fell in love with AleXa when I saw her live. I hope I win lol. Thanks for the post & GA."
1610,2020-11-02 20:10:50,jm9wki,"KNK's Knock still has one of my favorite kpop choruses. Those harmonies are killer and it's just so *good*, especially for a nugu debut back then.

And then I kind of forgot they existed (mostly due to my 1.5 year kpop hiatus) until Sunset, which is also a stellar release. I'm just gonna take this as a reminder to catch up on all the stuff in between."
1611,2020-11-02 17:01:27,jm9wki,"When i first heard Tomboy it didnt click with me for some reason but after listening to it again i ""got it"" and i  really like that track now.

Gonna have to check out her dance covers."
1612,2020-11-03 02:02:03,jm9wki,I love KNK! Especially their song Rain it was stuck in my head for ages. They truly deserve so much love💛💛💛
1613,2020-11-03 06:37:51,jm9wki,I LOVE KNK!! There latest comeback is incredible and Sunset is one my favorite kpop songs ever!

1615,2020-11-02 05:52:23,jm9wki,"I'm not sure if the plan was to have them go outside of the traditional idol route and become more like a Gavy NJ type of group or if there was a plan at all to be honest.  Cube did send them to music shows, but didn't seem to do much in the way of promotions otherwise."
1616,2020-11-02 06:49:02,jm9wki,"Ah I see, I'd imagine these groups aren't as expensive to produce so that makes sense! And who knows, maybe they'd hit it big like Mamamoo after shifting gears a little. Sad to see them go."
1617,2020-10-22 22:38:52,jg9co1,"Hellboy could yeah be played by pretty much anyone. The actors painted in red paint so it all comes to ability. Ron pearlman just has a great voice so Ill have a warm spot for him, but can enjoy other people taking the role.

Abe I think should always be doug Jones cause hes the greatest extremely tall and lanky actor who from all reports is a delight to do a 8 hour costume setting like he was in hellboy and shape of water. Though honestly its another person coated in body paint and costume so anyone could do him. 

Id love if a movie (or prefered series) would do bprd cause they have a good depth of cast and tackle social issues."
1618,2020-10-27 06:21:07,jg9co1,Who was the guy who played Luke Cage? I would LOVE to see him take a shot at Hellboy. Especially in a series style.
1619,2020-10-23 02:38:55,jg9co1,"I agree with what you said. Although Hellboy is the offspring of a white english witch, his skin color is still red and thus he *can* be played by anyone. As long as the person nails the character - blue collar guy who would rather stay at home and eat nachos rather than destroy the world or fight monsters- then I can dig it. I didn't care that much for the 2019 film, as it really didn't respect the mythos or characters. Hellboy was a whiny brat, Broom was an asshole, and Alice was just... uhh. She wasn't irish, didn't have an irish accent and the decision for her to have that throat-power was so bizarre. I wouldn't have cared about the actress being of color  if Alice at least lived in Ireland, but instead they gave her a pretty abysmal english accent. Bottom-line, cast whoever is best for the part and honors the source material."
1620,2020-10-22 22:44:37,jg9co1,"While I love Doug Jones, I’m the kind of person who like to leave the past behind. I think someone else should be allowed to try. And by the way, Abe isn’t that skinny, tall, shy guy Guillermo del Toro introduced. He is a pretty much solid muscular being, athletic and able to do military missions on his own. Of course he is not a tank like Hellboy or Roger, but he is not a sack of bones either."
1621,2020-10-27 06:24:28,jg9co1,"Mike Colter. (1,91m/6’3’’) 44 years old."
1622,2020-10-27 06:29:52,jg9co1,"I think he would be pretty great! His show ""Evil"" is on Netflix now and it is a paranormal investigation show. I think he would be great, i would have loved to see a younger Michael Clarke Duncan do it before he sadly passed. I love this post by the way I think non-human characters should be able to be played by anyone. The big red guy is genuinely one of the only fictional characters I have ever been this passionate about and I wouldn't mind seeing a person of color play him, especially if they are a solid actor."
1623,2020-10-27 07:42:42,jg9co1,"I think he will be a little too old for the whole streaming universe I planned (10-15 years ahead of first film or season...) he would start with at least 45/46 years, and then go on til he more than 50... for an action role."
1624,2020-10-27 07:44:22,jg9co1,I will add that Clancy Brown would have been an amazing Hellboy as well on his younger years...
1625,2020-10-29 16:49:20,jg9co1,Sorry I just saw this! I honestly wouldn't mind seeing some type of animated movie or show with clancy brown as the voice! If Ron isn't available of course.

As for why Desmond doesn’t tell Claire at the beginning, I think Desmond just doesn’t want everyone to know about his powers. By this point in the story, he’s still very secretive about his premonitions, having only told Charlie under pressure. I think he’s going to want to keep the flashes to himself for as long as possible, and he probably didn’t know Claire would be so accepting of Desmond and Charlie’s predicament, probably believing she would say he’s crazy."

1648,2020-12-08 17:12:29,k6uz3a,Saints Row games and Yakuza games really do an amazing job of taking the over the top self-aware humor to a level that breaks it out of the genre itself. Both of those franchises are simply fun.

SR3 was the glorious asshole power fantasy I always wanted. Friendly garage system! (Steal a vehicle once, have it for life, have it delivered whenever, trick out every possible aspect of it just because.) Well rewarded shenanigans! (Experience constantly dispensed for unsafe driving and such, and I ground the heck out of mayhem and insurance fraud for fun and profit.) Satisfying power and swag acquisition curve, including optional invincibility at end game! And all this around a core of fun and nicely varied missions, my favorite of which involved playing as a literal (well, virtual) toilet."

1669,2020-11-12 21:55:09,jt2s3e,"Jinnnnnn! I started Lost 10 years ago but stopped at season 4. Picked it up again during Quarantine and daaaamn, so many ladyboners. I’m personally a Sawyer girl but Jin is a sweetheart."
1670,2020-11-12 21:40:48,jt2s3e,Good lord that man is so fkn fine.
1671,2020-11-13 01:54:56,jt2s3e,Met him in person a couple times and he is truly SO sweet. Just genuinely a nice person.
1672,2020-11-13 03:17:01,jt2s3e,His jawline is legendary 😍
1673,2020-11-12 22:30:42,jt2s3e,"Whew, actually lost my breath, he’s stunning!"
1674,2020-11-13 03:30:12,jt2s3e,Currently rewatching lost rn and YASSSS 😍
1675,2020-11-13 03:00:49,jt2s3e,Oh most definitely 😁
1676,2020-11-13 03:46:21,jt2s3e,"This man needs to be in more movies and shows!
😅☺😳🥰"
1677,2020-11-13 04:48:14,jt2s3e,I haven't seen him in much but he sure is fine.
1678,2020-11-13 04:59:36,jt2s3e,Love him in Lost
1679,2020-11-13 07:10:27,jt2s3e,He has such a beautiful smile too
1680,2020-11-13 08:57:05,jt2s3e,"Is this from Lost? I loved it once upon a time, he was beautiful in it. Still is, magnificent bone structure."
1681,2020-11-13 05:48:02,jt2s3e,"Yeah Lost is filled with stunning people, just take your pick. Sawyer is my choice as well."
1682,2020-11-13 12:20:51,jt2s3e,Omg forgot about sawyer! Now I wanna rewatch it again!
1683,2020-11-13 10:36:37,jt2s3e,Agreed whole heatedly
1684,2020-11-13 05:00:26,jt2s3e,And checkbones
1685,2020-11-13 05:00:40,jt2s3e,I am watching it for the first time with my kids and we all love it. So hooked.
1686,2020-11-13 14:05:11,jt2s3e,Aw i love that! Im rewatching it for like the sixth time and I’m so invested in it like ive never seem it before 🤣 so good
1687,2020-11-12 00:20:33,jsj3sb,I've always felt the same! I LOVE this episode
1688,2020-11-12 01:21:31,jsj3sb,"I agree this is a really fun, character-driven episode.  I don't think that it sucks that restarting the van is a main plot point, especially since in a later episode Hurley saves the day in it by storming the beach and disrupting the Others' kidnapping plan."
1689,2020-11-12 01:55:28,jsj3sb,One of my favorite episodes. The characters are what made Lost.
1690,2020-11-12 05:20:56,jsj3sb,"I really like Hurley and Charlie’s interactions in this episode, as they both kind of help one another overcome their own negative feelings. Charlie is definitely feeling pretty terrible, knowing he is going to die, but Hurley helps him embrace his fate, rather than mope around. Similarly, Charlie volunteers to join Hurley on their drive down the hillside. Since Charlie is doomed to die, Hurley and Charlie are both taking a big risk in being in the same car, in a very precarious situation, however, they both come out on top and get the car working. It’s a surprisingly triumphant moment for these two characters who are both experiencing bad luck."
1691,2020-11-12 06:02:25,jsj3sb,Agree with everything and would like to add that the song Shambhala and Giaccino's orchestration at the end is another huge plus for this episode.
1692,2020-11-12 07:07:23,jsj3sb,"I'm doing a rewatch with my boyfriend (he's never seen the show, and it's been ten years since I watched it), and we watched this one tonight! Hurley's my favorite so I love all Hurley-centric episodes, and I knew this was a great one, but didn't remember any details. It was more fun than I remembered, and there were several heartwarming moments from Sawyer and Jin :)

Also has some of my favorite lines/gags, including Hurley's ""Shut up... red... neck... man"" and the great side character Roger Work Man."
1693,2020-11-13 06:06:51,jsj3sb,The ending of this episode (when they get the DHARMA van working again) is one of my all-time favorite Lost moments.
1694,2020-11-13 04:11:57,jsj3sb,It was a nonsense way to die. Poor Ms Tanaka.
1695,2020-11-12 01:56:02,jsj3sb,"I'd say more of a Chekhov's gun than a main plot point, but I see your point."
1696,2020-12-28 03:08:21,kl8oni,he looks like he gives great hugs
1697,2020-12-27 19:02:46,kl8oni,Yes!
1698,2020-12-27 22:16:12,kl8oni,"Yes, indeed."
1699,2020-12-27 22:52:18,kl8oni,Yes please!
1700,2020-12-28 00:49:05,kl8oni,Damnnn daniel !

1702,2020-12-28 00:38:51,kl8oni,Omg yaaaas. Literally the reason I enjoyed saints row 4 so much.
1703,2020-12-27 04:23:51,kkx0fe,Golden globes are a joke.

1708,2020-12-21 16:24:19,khikdp,">It's almost a stand-alone episode

I see it that way. For example, if I want to watch a random LOST episode, I'll watch this one, because it's self-contained."
1709,2020-12-21 15:06:18,khikdp,Very good and very fair recap👍
1710,2020-12-21 17:02:53,khikdp,"I don’t dislike the episode I just don’t care. It’s interesting to see the other side of some things. And sun finds out about Charlie, but nothing comes out of this episode with a lasting impact."
1711,2020-12-21 17:55:14,khikdp,"Upon a recent replay of the series, I actually really wished that Paulo survived and integrated with the main cast."
1712,2020-12-21 18:17:55,khikdp,"I know the general feeling about  ""Exposé"" (and I can understand why) but it is still one of my favorite. Because...

&#x200B;

1.  In mid season 3, we looked back to the Sydney airport and the earlier days of the survivor's adventures on the island.
2. We saw Boone and Shannon again. (Shannon's unique and Boone's second (and final) appereance on Season 3 until the end of the series final.) 
3. We listened Jack's leadership speech (Live together, die alone!) again.
4. We learned that who first discovered the drug smuggler's plane and the Pearl station, and saw Ben and Juliet talking about the Other's plans.
5. We found out how Shannon knew about the location and purpose of the case!
6. Locke enlightened us again: ""Things don't stay buried on this Island!""
7. Charlie's confession to Sun.
8. Sawyer's lack of leadership abilities. (Hurley will try to fix him later.) 
9. A strange love story.
10. ...and a memorable episode end."
1713,2020-12-21 18:24:26,khikdp,"I disagree on the episode being pointless. Next episode will further illustrate this, but Nikki and Paulo’s deaths were required for further character growth in the show going forward. Charlie confesses to Sun what he did to her, Hurley shows off his leadership skills, foreshadowing his role as Protector, and Sawyer will actually become more protective and caring of the other survivors after this incident.

It may seem pointless to some people, but there is a reason why this plotline is here."
1714,2020-12-21 19:50:11,khikdp,"monster getting the polar bear is the biggest twist of them all :D I noticed that this competition of competence is completely objective and not based on concepts of ""good and evil"" and I like that, but still, I was surprised

I really like this detective story, I think its important for the whole show, I am still working on figuring out how precisely"
1715,2020-12-25 03:23:06,khikdp,"I really like this episode for all the reasons you said. It’s just fun, and the ending twist feels very Edgar Allen Poe. I think Exposé was a parody of a late 90s/early 2000s syndicated show called VIP starring Pamela Anderson. Exposé might actually be a better show, from the little we see of it."
1716,2021-03-10 00:01:46,khikdp,"I found it very interesting. The interposition of the investigation along with the events, while nothing new, was really entertaining. The ending made my jaw drop, totally unexpected.

One thing I wonder, we see lots of scenes from season 1, season 2 and season 3 but with Nikki and Paulo being the ""focus"". For example the scene just after the crash, did they film the scenes alongside Season 1 knowing they'd use that later on for a Nikki and Paulo episode ?"
1717,2020-12-28 02:26:10,khikdp,Thank you!
1718,2020-12-28 02:26:27,khikdp,This is a hot take that is now living rent free in my head.
1719,2021-03-10 15:00:20,khikdp,"Some of it was reused footage from old episodes, but they filmed all new scenes for Nikki and Paulo and just made them look like they were part of the older episodes."
1720,2020-12-21 11:01:19,khf4x7,He moves to San Francisco with Abby and Sara after accepting a job to run his own task force there.
1721,2020-12-19 19:46:32,kgeh7l,This man's facial bone structure is like an art piece. It's god-tier.
1722,2020-12-19 20:41:44,kgeh7l,Those cheekbones and that jawline...gorgeous!
1723,2020-12-19 23:34:34,kgeh7l,His face is a work of art
1724,2020-12-19 20:58:52,kgeh7l,Omg I thought I was alone in finding him incredibly sexy. He has perfect bone structure and he's hilarious.
1725,2020-12-19 22:44:26,kgeh7l,Yes!!! He’s beautiful
1726,2020-12-21 01:43:38,kgeh7l,I just started salivating
1727,2020-12-21 02:11:34,kgeh7l,*swoons*
1728,2020-12-19 23:29:44,kgeh7l,I couldn't possibly agree more.
1729,2020-12-20 01:12:05,kgeh7l,So beautiful!
1730,2020-12-19 23:01:35,kg4vuc,Michelle Rodriguez had a bigger one in my opinion. But I always thought the Walt kid would be one of those sad child star stories so I’m glad he moved to music instead and grew up normally especially with how big the show was.
1731,2020-12-19 09:40:09,kg4vuc,"Yes, Terry O Quinn is in many good properties as well. I wish Matthew Fox was in more stuff I have no clue why he isnt. Same goes for Josh Halloway"
1732,2020-12-19 11:28:28,kg4vuc,"Dominic Monaghan has done quite well also, although he was big before lost had started"
1733,2020-12-19 12:02:23,kg4vuc,I thought josh Halloway would be way more successful. He was on the show colony which was good but cancelled.
1734,2020-12-19 23:04:24,kg4vuc,Harold Perrineau was in Oz AND Lost yet he still doesn’t have countless Emmys. He’s on claws playing a pretty challenging character and was in 2 movie franchises (matrix and the best man) but he should really be more well known
1735,2020-12-20 17:15:41,kg4vuc,"Yeah, I think Lily has the biggest role, but Rodriguez has had the biggest career."
1736,2020-12-22 13:06:32,kg4vuc,she was kinda big prior to Lost but I see your point.
1737,2020-12-19 10:28:07,kg4vuc,He never seemed to like the business much and prefers his life on his ranch.
1738,2020-12-19 23:02:43,kg4vuc,He gave up television after Lost. It took time away from his family so he did film for a while and just gave up.
1739,2020-12-22 13:05:58,kg4vuc,has he?
1740,2020-12-19 22:40:03,kg4vuc,"Thought the same thing. One year after Lost ended, he got a sweet role in *Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol*. I thought he was on his way toget many aciton-packed roles. But that didn't happen. I remember all the rumours last decade about him becoming Aquaman as well."
1741,2020-12-23 08:29:40,kg4vuc,"same! he's doing yellowstone now which has gotten popular-ish (but he doesn't have the biggest part), but he deserves WAY better. he gives me total matthew mcconaughey vibes a lot of the time and i feel like he could/should definitely be cast in much bigger roles in the future."
1742,2020-12-20 23:15:14,kg4vuc,"Wholeheartedly agree. Harold Perrineau is one of the most underrated actors on the show - for me, he's up there with Emerson and O'Quinn. I've loved him since Oz, and he stole the show in Romeo and Juliet too. I think he portrayed Michael's despair over losing Walt brilliantly. Such a shame Michael's storyline went to shit, the actor (and character) had so much potential."
1743,2020-12-22 16:38:40,kg4vuc,Yes
1744,2021-04-09 15:37:36,kg4vuc,"Yeah, LOTR (obviously), X-Men, his own wildlife show or something and Star Wars"
1745,2021-01-20 02:14:51,kg4vuc,He’s super hot.
