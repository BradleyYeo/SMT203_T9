0,2020-02-06 00:45:03,ezbed3,"I recall her saying the song is about her realising they are the same type of person and are going to make a great team. So on that note, that means Joe likely dated a lot just as she did (which makes all the references to ‚Äúthe other girls‚Äù on the album make sense, as well as worrying about him leaving or him finding someone else). She‚Äôs likely realising they were both two players looking to be tamed."
1,2020-02-05 16:47:51,ezbed3,"I love the ""he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor"" connection you made to the Jaylor ship name. I definitely think it works, but then again, was Taylor subtle with this reference? Something to think about.

Also, did anyone notice in the video's beginning when 89 and 91 were graffiti on the wall? Another clue she left in there."
2,2020-02-06 05:02:53,ezbed3,"The only thing that confuses me though, is that I don't think she sees herself as a player (and I don't think she is). She was pretty hurt when people had the false perception that she was a man-eater, so I think part of this song is satirical and kind of sarcastic about that perception. She definitely dated several times before, but not to such an extreme. At the same time though, maybe she's reflecting on her past couple relationships or something, and how she doesn't want to be going from guy to guy? or that they both have this reputation (kind of like in End Game)?"
3,2020-02-05 17:35:57,ezbed3,"ah I never saw the numbers, I‚Äôll have to rewatch! You‚Äôre right though, Taylor is NEVER subtle üß°"
4,2020-02-06 06:02:06,ezbed3,"Her saying it vs the media using it against her are two different things. Regardless she dated a lot of very famous and rich men very publicly. I think she became more honest about it with Rep and Lover. Rep makes several references to her being a player, a heartbreaker and someone who toyed with exes for ‚Äúfun‚Äù. Paper Rings then notes ‚Äúwithout *all* the exes‚Äù."
5,2020-02-06 06:29:40,ezbed3,"She hasn't had *that* many exes though, she even discussed that in a recent interview, and how people had the wrong impression...but yes, she did have some high-profile relationships. The stuff in Reputation where she said she played with people and all that, I'm pretty sure that was satire playing into the villain narrative, since a lot of that album was from the media perception (according to Taylor). She recently said that it was largely a character invention, which does make sense. I think in The Archer, she explains what ends up happening in her relationships, but it sounds more like she has issues with trust because she was hurt in the past. I just don't think she is someone who intentionally ""plays"" people.  Anyway, I may be wrong though"
6,2020-02-06 06:45:13,ezbed3,"To most people 8+ is a lot, especially for a woman and especially when it garners global headlines and involves an equally famous man the world was already watching as well. I‚Äôm not saying they weren‚Äôt being unfair in their judgement of her. But she couldn‚Äôt have gone the entire length of her fame until Harry to notice how her dating or just stepping out with someone else famous caused reactions. I say Harry because that‚Äôs when she decided to lay low with dating until Calvin and then let all hell break loose with Tom. 

And we can‚Äôt pretend she didn‚Äôt initially use the dating/songs about them angle to establish her brand in the beginning. She was using it as her own punchline until around 2013 when she noticed the tone was changing and seemed to link the Harry breakup to the media/fan storm surrounding them."
7,2020-02-06 07:23:30,ezbed3,"Just gonna chime in here. She did use the angle that songs were about her relationships, but it wasn't about how many relationships she had been in or how ""boy crazy"" she was. The media completely twisted things and made her look like some kind of man-eater, who seduces every guy she comes into contact with. It's unfair that 8+ in this many years is too much for a woman, but men can have so many more parters and it's not a problem (obviously the inspiration behind The Man). She went into most of these relationships looking for lasting love, and I doubt she ever meant to hurt or ""play"" anyone."
8,2020-02-06 08:52:56,ezbed3,"I don‚Äôt think we can say what she went in for and it wouldn‚Äôt matter if she didn‚Äôt go in for lasting love. 

My point is more that for her she was going along with the joke til it wasn‚Äôt a joke anymore. And this is different to looking back and being like ‚ÄúYep I played some of these guys as hard as they played me but I‚Äôm done with that now‚Äù. She wouldn‚Äôt use lyrics like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so very tame now‚Äù or ‚Äúbefore I found someone to commit too‚Äù if she didn‚Äôt mean it."
9,2020-02-06 09:41:44,ezbed3,"Yea I don't think we can know for sure, but considering that she has always said she's a romantic, I would guess that she just wanted to find love for the most part (and her older lyrics were all about that). I know what you mean, she did put clues about who the songs were about, but I think that's about it.

I guess I've always seen a player as someone who fakes love for someone just to get what they want out of them or is always cheating, which to me doesn't sound like her. The media just ended up exaggerating things to such an extent that she was hurt by it (blank space). The lyrics you mentioned just sound like she dated several times and those relationships didn't end up lasting for one reason or another."
10,2020-02-06 11:03:32,ezbed3,"Her older lyrics were written when she was a teen. She talks a lot more about the intricacies of casual relationships, rebounds and genuine mistakes in her more recent work which is obvious because she‚Äôs had different relationships for different reasons. 

From what she‚Äôs said from roughly Never Getting Back Together til now is that she will play along with a player until it becomes all turmoil."
11,2020-02-06 10:00:17,ezbed3,"I would have to agree with you. While she did date several guys, I wouldn't call her a player by any means. It's pretty evident in her music that she really did care about the guys that she dated. I think she ended up falling for the wrong people or her own fears got in the way. She was also deeply hurt by some of them (they cheated, manipulated her, etc), so why is she the one that's being called that? She shouldn't have to stay in an unhappy relationship and sacrifice her own well-being. The point of The Man was to say that it's unfair that women aren't even allowed to date more than a few times without being slut shamed, but men get to actually *be* players and they're literally praised for it. Anyway, she's finally found someone who makes her incredibly happy, and I'm glad :)

Regarding songs from Reputation such as RFI, you kind of have to keep in mind that some parts are satire and some are the real story- and some are kind of a mesh of the two. I think when it comes to her talking about being a player, it's mainly from the perspective of her reputation"
12,2020-02-06 13:25:59,ezbed3,"Oh of course, I agree that she's had casual relationships and rebounds and mistakes, I was mainly talking about her earlier relationships since those were what sparked the media criticism. I still don't really see her as a player though. There was a quote by her that said she doesn't want to be the kind of girl with an endless stream of boyfriends, she wants to be in love. She may have gone along with a player here and there, but she may have also had feelings for them and felt that was the only way- we don't really know. I think she tried the casual dating for a while, but that wasn't really her thing.

What Taylor said about blank space: ""That is not my approach to relationships. But is it cool to write the narrative of a girl who's crazy but seductive but glamorous but nuts but manipulative? That was the character I felt the media had written for me, and for a long time I felt hurt by it. I took it personally. But as time went by, I realized it was kind of hilarious.""

Anyway, I don't mean to argue! I'm going to head to sleep lol"
13,2020-02-05 15:26:43,ezan73,WHy be worried ur generating clicks and views. Sure they bringing the hate but they also bringing an audience...
14,2020-02-05 21:03:47,ezan73,I feel like having said *anything* about Taylor Swift is a setup to generate negative reactions. Those kids can‚Äôt be pleased if you aren‚Äôt making her out to be a goddess. Source: insane ex-coworker

But seriously, any opinions about any popular topic will have some backlash from someone. As long as you aren't actively trying to encourage hate, which it doesn't sound like you are doing at all, you should be fine."
16,2020-02-05 20:53:38,ezan73,"Any publicity is good publicity. Hopefully your regular viewers as well as randoms coming across your video see it for what it is: silly fan hate.

Start some controversy and ride that shit man! How do you think people like the Paul bros got famous lol"
17,2020-02-05 23:00:59,ezan73,I feel like I need your guest to appear on my channel! Ride that wave for a long as you can man. Word of Mouth is going to really grow your channel.
18,2020-02-05 16:24:16,ezan73,"If it is bringing in any type of growth for your channel which sometimes very contraversial videos will do, you might want to leave it. You will often see videos get so much hate but at the same time gain thousands and thousands of subscribers and new viewers as well. 

If it is just bringing in hate and not helping your channel grow at all, I would probably delete it if it's stressing you out. Another thing you might want to do if you want to keep it up is turn comments off on the video and/or turn off showing likes and dislikes for it too."
19,2020-02-05 16:06:11,ezan73,But I don‚Äôt really want that level of negativity on my channel. Also the offensive comments.
20,2020-02-05 16:25:39,ezan73,Hmmm yeah good point. I think it got shared on a Taylor Swift fan page because the views and the comments jumped up very quickly. I guess I‚Äôll ride out the hate storm and hope that all these comments help it get picked up by the algorithm.
21,2020-02-05 16:45:21,ezan73,"Offensive comments comes with the territory. Your going to get those no matter what you make. You could be making content that is wholesome and people will still act like that. What matters is how you handle the hate. You shrug it off and you continue to make the content you want. The haters will eventually see that your channel isn't about the thing they came there for. 

In my other channel I made a vid criticizing a female YTer on her very idiotic takes on the current MK11 when it was coming out. She seriously had 0 idea what she talking about and showed a massive amount of stupidity towards the topic. 

I called it out and pointed out her nonsense, she took it well and was ok, but her lil fanbase and a particular writer tried to paint me as some kind of misogynist sexist man baby SJW. When my channel is 100% none of that, I criticize the SJW stuff and hate on it and fools showed up to just to thumb down the vid and leave hate in my comments. The metrics showed I got an average of idiots only watching 0 - 3 min of the vid and they all wanted to throw insults. I combatted their hate by using actual arguments and blowing their nonsense up in their faces. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3sa4bTRWB4

When I ran a stream that week these fools wanted to head in and hate on my crew and I to call us SJWs and reee at us, then  found out I was none of the crap they threw at me. I actually gained more subs over it and got more attention out of it. The writer One Angry Gamer tried to smear me and instead made me stronger. 

Don't cave when you did nothing wrong, do your thing and screw all the haters."

23,2020-02-05 17:15:16,ezae2i,"Yeah not Topanga. That‚Äôs where yo go to get away from LA. 

Santa Monica makes sense. 

Maybe check out Laurel Canyon. Similar vibe to Topanga."
24,2020-02-05 14:56:51,ezae2i,"I can‚Äôt even do the complexity of this traffic situation, but Topanga canyon is so cool and not a place I have heard of any tourists staying. I encourage you to do it!"
25,2020-02-05 16:18:39,ezae2i,"I'd say Santa Monica for sure.  Topanga, depending when you're trying to get around the city, there will be times when you need to spend an hour getting to somewhere you'd want to be.  It's not really a destination.  There's not a lot there.

Santa Monica has a lot of beautiful stuff that you can walk to if you plan it right.  

I'm not a New Yorker so this may be a terrible example, but it's a bit like asking if you should stay in New Jersey when you visit, or in the city proper.  New Jersey might be beautiful (ahem, maybe not a perfect analogy) but it's a big to-do to leave your place, and a big to-do to get back.  Not ideal for a short tourist trip."

39,2020-02-05 12:30:42,ez8nms,"Our dreams are meaningless but not random - your brain puts people, places, feelings and events you're familiar with into them, but often without any rhyme or reason. So, for example, farmers dream of animals about ten times more often than people who live in cities, and nearly everyone has anxiety dreams based in school (like not knowing the answers to a test) because we spend so many years there.

All this means that your brain is simply choosing someone you're very familiar with, and also choosing to have a sex dream (those are pretty common, too). Spend more time with girls your age and you'll likely see a variety of people in your dreams."
40,2020-02-05 18:21:43,ez8nms,"You can't control your dreams. I mean, basically dreams are just little bytes of sensations and memories that your brain, because we think in narrative form, strings into narratives. So you could've been dreaming about your mother at the same time you were totally-unrelatedly sexually aroused and the two turned into a narrative of having sex with your mother.

Earlier this year while I was visiting my son I had a series of incest dreams about my great-grandfather, who's been dead for half a century. We'd been talking about family history that night, and I guess I was feeling a little frisky in my sleep, so..."

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules).

I think it's less that she's ""a democrat"" and more she is against what Republican party members are standing for and claiming is 'the way America is supposed to be'.

I.e. she, like most rational folks..., thinks criminalizing gays and trans folks is bad (not that Republicans think it's okay, but the vocal minority is who gets the most attention so candidates appeal to them)

Non hotel people don‚Äôt really get how exhausting these kind of f-ups can be, because you have to polite, efficient and calm the whole way through doing seven different things at once and still keeping track of each in depth while you‚Äôre internally having a melt down because there‚Äôs no one else free to take on some of the burden, plus you‚Äôre usually such a giver that you will kill yourself trying to give more than you have left just to keep up the standards of service because it doesn‚Äôt occur to you to stop.

110,2020-02-05 13:48:01,ez0yh6,"We were staying at a ski resort in the summer a few years ago.  I was in the parking garage waiting for the elevator and my mom was nearby looking at some information the resort had on a bulletin board.  While waiting I was watching a van with a luggage carrier on the top drive slowly up the incline to the level I was on.  There were probably 50 parking places and cars in about 5 of them.  They basically had almost any spot they wanted.  

The driver of the van started to park and once in the stall for whatever reason, backed out and started pulling into the next stall on the right.  Got about half way in, backed up, straightened out the van and proceeded forward to park.  And proceeded to hit a sprinkler head with the luggage carrier.  Water everywhere and alarms going off.  They back the van out of the stall and went and parked on a different level.  

I was the only person in the entire resort who saw what happened.  I‚Äôm sure they had camera footage they could view.  But no one (other than the people in the van) knew what had happened."
111,2020-02-05 13:13:27,ez0yh6,"Concealed sprinkler heads have been available for decades, and should be used in hotel rooms to prevent things like this, in addition to looking better than exposed heads."
112,2020-02-05 13:24:50,ez0yh6,"It seems sprinkler heads need a better design if hanging something as light as a dress, or getting hit by a ball, can cause a quarter million in damages."
113,2020-02-05 13:47:31,ez0yh6,"You have balls of steel. You didn‚Äôt huff or get upset about it, you put on your big boy pants and just handled it.

I‚Äôm amazed at how cooly you handled the situation and inheriting a shit-show before the get-go is insane.

Props to you for taking the reins and making things happen during a catastrophe. 
It was a terrible time for you and I am so sorry you went through that. What you achieved though despite the emergency is nothing short of a miracle.

Brilliant work to you and your team!"
114,2020-02-05 22:07:50,ez0yh6,"Well I'll be damned.  I was going to call BS on this story, because I know exactly which hotel you are talking about and I had never heard this happened, despite being just 15 miles away. Somehow, you only had two negative reviews posted online about this.  That, in of itself, is truly amazing!

Unbelievable (literally) response by you and the team.  Great teamwork and excellent job of keeping the story in house.  I remember that weekend with the Swift concert, and it was definitely an area wide sellout.  I have no idea where you found rooms."
115,2020-02-05 14:30:31,ez0yh6,Woman.  Review.  Hotel ruined my special day!
116,2020-02-05 14:03:43,ez0yh6,I really hope she had to pay something. Because seriously??? She did a whole lot of damage and inconvenienced a lot of people. That she should get of with nothing isn't right.
117,2020-02-05 14:40:30,ez0yh6,"I‚Äôll never understand how people can be so stupid as to hang something on a sprinkler. Even if there weren‚Äôt a sign of a hangar with an X over it next to it. 

When I was in grad school, I lived in a dorm (it was set up like an extended stay hotel) during the week because we had moved the semester before. 

My first night in the dorm, a girl hung her clothes on the sprinkler. It broke and flooded the rooms beneath her‚Äôs. 4 rooms per floor for 5 floors. 

When the alarms went off, I got out of bed, checked the hallway for smoke and heat. Finding none, I got fully dressed, grabbed my backpack and headed to a local hotel to use some points and checked in at 1AM. 

The kids in the dorm all went downstairs in pajamas ‚Äî some looked like they were pretty skimpy. I hear later they were made to walk across campus to the student union and given cots until they could get back in the building in the morning. Crazy."
118,2020-02-05 22:47:56,ez0yh6,"You know what's funny?  When I was in hotels, the slightest thing like a printer dying would send me into a blind rage but if a major catastrophe occurred I'd just roll up my sleeves and get to work on the problem."

  If you got one of those 3 dollar sprinkler heads,  and you obviously know there crap as you added the sign to say dont hang,   and you know it could empty out a 200 plus room hotel if one was to break.

It's not the customer whose a retard lol. Upgrade those heads"
122,2020-02-05 02:11:58,ez0yh6,"I'm a stay at home dad now, thankfully"
123,2020-02-05 03:39:31,ez0yh6,Now I need to get a hotel room and look for the sprinkler.  I have stayed in a few hotels and most have a closet to hang things in.  The ones that didn't I just laid hanging items over a chair.  I never thought to look at the celling; people really think sprinklers are good for hanging stuff on?  People are dumb.
124,2020-02-05 13:25:43,ez0yh6,Makes you think it might be time to upgrade the fire sprinkler design.
125,2020-02-05 03:15:21,ez0yh6,I was tempted more than once...
126,2020-02-05 03:10:36,ez0yh6,"Insurance...mostly covered it. Our original claim was about 300k. We took 250k at the end of the day. Any damages would be up to Insurance to go after the guest for, but she didn't have anything worth suing for from what I gathered."
127,2020-02-05 02:38:15,ez0yh6,Probably let the insurance fight to get whatever they can out of them (called subrogation) rather than fighting too much on the direct bill from the hotel.
128,2020-02-05 11:00:25,ez0yh6,One of the things you have insurance for is so that *they* can go full bear. And also so that when the perpetrator don‚Äôt own a house you still get paid.
129,2020-02-05 20:16:22,ez0yh6,"fuck, as someone who is currently planning her wedding. just no. i would tell my groomsmen to tell her to fuck off or he can foot the bill. (im normally not a bridezilla, but shit, this would do it. well that and my mother or DH mother showing up in a white or black dress, or an obvious trying to steal the show type of dress)"
130,2020-02-05 13:50:14,ez0yh6,"Don't be so sure about it. My experience is that outside of casino properties, most don't have nearly enough cameras. Especially in places like parking garages."
131,2020-02-05 13:19:33,ez0yh6,"If I was involved in design and construction I would totally agree.

Unfortunately, all to uncommon still. I don't think I've ever worked some place with a concealed sprinkler system"
132,2020-02-05 13:26:23,ez0yh6,To be fair. This was not a little cocktail dress. It was a heavy formal dress. She wanted to hang it up from the sprinkler instead of the closest because of how long it was. But yes.
133,2020-02-05 22:10:30,ez0yh6,"Rhode Island for one thing. And about an hour west. Also one of the nearby colleges has a small convention center with rooms. They don't really run it like a normal hotel, if they don't have a convention, they're wife open. They're not on OTAs either. They took 150 of my rooms that night. True life saver. The rest was a scramble"
134,2020-02-05 14:37:28,ez0yh6,"So. We got lots of reviews about this event of course. Thankfully, none from that guest. 

Fun fact or brand company (rhymes with bear a ton and then Gary Lot) allowed us to exclude all of the surveys from guests over these dates from our overall score. Otherwise we would have been really screwed.

Another detail. One of the two wedding groups in house (one that hadn't invited the offending guest) called the local press to try and get them to cover the disaster and their ""ruined wedding"" in order to bend us over a barrel for a better discount. 

Contractually, we could have declared Force Majuere and cancelled the whole wedding and left them with just a refund. Instead, we found them an alternate venue with one of our sister hotels (same management company) and executed relocating their entire wedding and event in less than 24 hours. We did that for 2 of the 3 weddings in fact. That's what my GM was doing on Sunday while I ran the closed hotel. My GM just about hit the roof when he found out they had called the local news to try and smear us."
135,2020-02-05 14:04:30,ez0yh6,"As far as I know, nothing. Life ain't fair."
136,2020-02-05 14:49:58,ez0yh6,"Fun fact. About 6 months after this happened, a sprinkler discharge happened at a local college. The college had already over enrolled and had rented out our entire first floor for dorm rooms. Then their room block suddenly doubled on us. I was much happier to be receiving people displaced by a sprinkler than relocating them."
137,2020-02-05 12:07:55,ez0yh6,"I mean.... That would work on most hotels. Fire sprinkler aren't hard to set off if you're trying. 

Check in on a OTA rate under a fake name with no contact info and walk away in the chaos? And you'd get away with it too. 

That's not what used to keep me up at night though. It was the phone call pranksters that would call guests and try to get them to destroy their room."

140,2020-02-05 02:52:38,ez0yh6,Well lease at  u can spend more time with your kids at home compared to go through that hell again like those dumbass guests  you had to deal with
141,2020-02-05 14:28:01,ez0yh6,"I understand your thankfulness of being a stay at home dad.  I do not miss my hotel days.  I still (15 years later) have nightmares about working there. When I finally left, I went to a call centre. I was at a total loss as to what to do between calls.  I could not believe that the only thing I had to do was answer calls.  After being on 24/7 call for 5 years, the idea of doing only one thing at a time was foreign to me. I was used to multitasking so much stuff.  When I logged out, I was done.  It was mind boggling for a long time"
142,2020-02-05 16:30:50,ez0yh6,There will be days you long for the chaos of those 3 days... But it's great for you to be able to be at home with the kid(s). It's such a privilege.
143,2020-02-05 03:52:46,ez0yh6,"I've stayed in several hotels that had the sprinkler head mounted about 6 ft off the floor on a wall. It would be a convenient place to hang something, if you don't know how sprinklers work and why that's a terrible idea."
144,2020-02-05 13:33:26,ez0yh6,Or people could not be complete dumb asses.
145,2020-02-05 15:24:44,ez0yh6,"Sprinklers are brilliantly designed. They're cheap and easy to manufacture and do the job well.

In hotels they must be installed vertically where people can't get at them. I'm in a hotel right now and the sprinklers have little plugs on them to hide them from the morons..."
146,2020-02-05 05:08:51,ez0yh6,Given the circumstances I don't think I would have blamed you.
147,2020-02-05 04:00:05,ez0yh6,I hope you had enough information about her to put her on a DNR list.  Unbelievable!
148,2020-02-06 14:00:18,ez0yh6,I'm told she still went to the wedding.... Which was astounding to me. She literally had no shame.
149,2020-02-05 15:44:52,ez0yh6,"I just assumed there were cameras. I didn‚Äôt look for any.  Didn‚Äôt even think about it.  

The firefighters were there multiple times a day for 2 days because the alarms kept going off.  They were not thrilled about it.  It was the firefighters who realized I had seen what happened."
150,2020-02-05 16:24:10,ez0yh6,Ours is concealed. But our property was literally built last year so it‚Äôs all nice and new.
151,2020-02-08 15:01:21,ez0yh6,"My wife is involved in construction, often on site.

The problem is in cost, specifically once the project is underway and the GC and the fire sprinkler guy haven't built enough contingency money into their bids.

Then comes what's euphemistically called ""value engineering"", where dimes and pennies are wrung from every slightly premium fixture, sometimes with ridiculous consequences.

Not necessarily speaking for your property, but I've heard stories over dinner of this exact thing happening - cheaper heads being installed to save net a couple thousand dollars in a big job.  Fun part is when they fail vertical clearance by being in a ducting/airhandler soffit."
152,2020-02-06 05:32:20,ez0yh6,Still sounds like a really poor design.
153,2020-02-05 22:12:23,ez0yh6,I know exactly the college your talking about.  Bailed me out more than once.  üòÅ
154,2020-02-05 15:18:21,ez0yh6,"It would never occur to me to leave a bad review about a fire alarm flood power outage or something similarly out of the hotels control.

I would rave about the hotels ability to handle the crisis especially since they would arrange a new room.

That you had to have all the reviews excluded shows how many people are that self-centered and lack empathy for your situation. Its sad."
155,2020-02-07 04:36:45,ez0yh6,Did the local press not know about this until the guestzilla called them?  lol  They're not exactly the NY Times are they?
156,2020-02-05 19:50:31,ez0yh6,That's ridiculous

165,2020-02-05 15:48:47,ez0yh6,"Nope. In fact, I've yet to work at a hotel with cameras covering guest parking, with the exception of areas where valets are parking. It's all about liability and cost. Camera systems are just now getting cheap enough that I could theoretically carpet bomb a midsized business hotel in cameras if I wanted. Even then the question from ownership is always about return on investment. It's generally not there for parking garages."
166,2020-02-08 15:30:50,ez0yh6,"Having never done a new build hotel, but having been part of renovations, I can almost guarantee this is what happens every time. 

I mean, in 20 years of hotel work, this is the first time I've seen this exact set if circumstances. And same for my GM who has even more. 

One time, I had a contractor working in a guest room, welding something, and the Engineer's didn't deactivate the sprinkler system in that room and set it off. 

That's all to say, by the time you're at that stage of the project, spending ""extra money"" on better sprinklers can seem like a waste. Especially to a Project Manager or Asset Manager. It's a short sited decision. But one that weighs the risk to reward I guess."

No idea what the press knew before the wedding group called them. I imagine someone might have been listening to a scanner, but we never had a truck out front."

171,2020-02-05 12:40:06,ez0yh6,"I think a setup like you described would be pretty rare throughout most of the US. 

But we had fire extinguishers too. Over a weekend with a bunch of hockey families in house we had a couple kids steal and set off a fire extinguisher in a stairwell. The particulate triggered the alarm system and evacuated the building. Though thankfully not the sprinklers. 

Those kids also shoved a housekeeping cart into the pool and dumped shampoo into the jacuzzi. 

Damn I hated those hockey kids."
172,2020-02-05 05:02:57,ez0yh6,"Generally there's what looks like a piece of red glass. It's actually a vial full of a (dyed) liquid with a low boiling point. When it gets too hot, it boils, shattering the vial. The vial is holding a plug in the nozzle, so when it shatters the plug pops out and the water starts flowing. Hanging something on it might rip the whole sprinkler head off, or it might just break the vial, which would start the sprinkler going."

177,2020-02-05 05:10:41,ez0yh6,Oh okay! Thank you for explaining- I had no idea about the vial in there. Makes sense it would be heat sensitive somehow.
178,2020-02-05 13:44:12,ez0yh6,"Aren't there also those with a piece of heat-reactive metal that do the same basic thing? Once it heats up, it deforms and releases the water, I think."
179,2020-02-06 11:17:23,ez0yh6,"Being a gang of 12-14 year old boy, unsupervised, because your parents are in the lobby getting drunk brings it the worst in them. Soccer kids were bad too."
180,2020-02-05 13:22:30,ez0yh6,"Smoke alarms are smok triggered, which is good for being sensitive and detecting fires quickly because the smoke spreads. The sprinklers are heat triggered, so that you don't release more liquid than you need to and cause more damage than you need to. This is why almost every movie scene you've ever seen where all the sprinklers in the building go off at the same time because one is triggered are wrong.

Another interesting fact is that most sprinkler systems are wet pipe, meaning that they're full of water at all times. Because this water is just sitting in the pipes for years, it's usually nasty, smelly, and very dirty. Extra fun to clean up!"
181,2020-02-05 18:14:40,ez0yh6,"Older ones had a 2-piece strut holding the plug in place, with the 2 pieces at an angle so that water pressure would act to collapse it and push it out of the way. There was a link soldered with Wood's metal (an alloy that melts below the boiling point of water) blocking that from happening - heat from a fire would melt the Wood's metal and the plug would come out of the nozzle.

These have been displaced by the vial type for two main reasons. Wood's metal contains lead (environmental regulations), and room temperature is high enough to put lead alloys into the ""hot working"" region, where a phenomenon known as ""creep"" occurs (over time, a ""hot worked"" metal object under stress will deform), so there was always the chance of a sprinkler going off ""for no reason"". In a parking garage that's not too much of a problem. In an office or hotel room there's stuff that would be ruined by the water.

Lead ""creep"" was one of the methods used by ""time pencils"" (simple devices used to trigger a mechanical detonator) in WW2. If the cross-section of the lead is known, along with the strength of a spring trying to stretch it, you can get a rough idea of how long it will be at a given temperature before the lead wire breaks, allowing the firing pin (pushed by the spring) to fly out and hit the detonating cap. The time/temperature information was printed on a tag attached to the safety pin (holds back the firing pin so there's no stress on the lead), so once the device was armed EOD people had no way to tell if it was a 1/2 hour unit or one with a few days delay."
182,2020-02-05 18:09:03,ez0yh6,I think some of them have a wax plug that melts also.
183,2020-02-05 18:08:28,ez0yh6,"I hate that Hollywood thinks that every sprinkler goes off at once, it drives me insane.   Does the water in the sprinkler line really get nasty, or just rusty?  I have some fire hydrants on long (50 year old) lines with no other connections.  They get flow tested every 5 years and the water that comes out is perfectly clear."
184,2020-02-06 07:06:20,ez0yh6,Had the pleasure seeing the aftermath of a dorm building at least 50 years old with a system that hadn't seen fresh water in the new millennium. That's a smell I'll never forget
185,2020-02-05 21:31:42,ez0yh6,"At least around me the fire hydrants are fed from the regular water main, so even though the hydrant isn't used all the regular water usage in the area keeps the water flowing. Sprinkler systems are fed by dedicated piping, so the water gets stagnant and smelly pretty quickly."
186,2020-02-06 23:39:08,ez0yh6,"There is one type of system that does the ‚ÄúHollywood ‚Äú thing. A deluge system has all open heads and a single valve connected to a sensor, although they are not used in someplace like a hotel. More for a high hazard area that would need lots of water fast."
187,2020-02-06 13:55:46,ez0yh6,This is correct. Can verify.

195,2020-03-28 12:41:17,fqi2es,"You say BB won't waste the roster with Stidham but all indications are that Bill and the org really like him. I don't rule out a qb in the round 3 area (Eason, Hurts, Gordon, Fromm) but I just don't see giving up a future first to move up and get Love. There is no pressure to win right away. I think Bill will build the team as he normally would and then try and develop a mid round qb. If they all suck maybe they'll end up with a high enough pick to go and get an elite prospect that he loves but I don't see Love being that guy at pick 9"
196,2020-03-28 12:35:54,fqi2es,"Packers trade up to draft Reagor, draft a Qb in round 2 and don‚Äôt draft an ilb in the first 3 rounds??? WTF"
197,2020-03-28 12:51:35,fqi2es,"As a lions fan, my pp is hard"
198,2020-03-28 13:27:31,fqi2es,If the Chiefs draft RB and WR in the first three rounds without addressing the CB position (our biggest need by far) then I would be pissed.
199,2020-03-28 12:46:36,fqi2es,I don't like us taking a TE over a CB at all considering we just lost our CB1 and essentially spent a 2nd on Hurst
200,2020-03-28 13:51:31,fqi2es,"I appreciate the effort but our LB group is one of the best in the NFL. Jayon Brown and Rashaan Evans are amazing inside and David Long Jr is a nice number 3. Murray's a good player but we have much more pressing needs at OT, CB, DL and EDGE."
201,2020-03-28 15:49:30,fqi2es,This seems really bad for a lot of teams lol. Appreciate the effort tho
202,2020-03-28 12:03:15,fqi2es,K.J. Hamler over Kenneth Murray or Patrick Queen for the Ravens...this is probably the worst pick possible for the Ravens who need LBs since we only have L.J. Fort as a starter right now.
203,2020-03-28 12:20:47,fqi2es,"I like this mock, only thing is that the seahawks dont pick corners Rd2 and Arnette does not meet their strict arm length requirements (32""). I'd love it if we got an OT with that pick"
204,2020-03-28 13:35:46,fqi2es,"While edge depth is certainly a huge concern in Cleveland, I don‚Äôt think you can spend both 3rds on edge if you doubled down on tackle at 10 and 41. There‚Äôs too big of holes at LB and FS to ignore on day 2. A pick of Curtis Weaver or Marlon Davidson at 41, followed by Malik Harrison at 74 and Ashtyn Davis at 97 would‚Äôve been a near perfect draft for Cleveland imo. With the Conklin signing I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs as much of a need to grab 2 tackles early, I‚Äôd rather grab a developmental tackle some time on day 3 and spend day 2 upgrading the defense."
205,2020-03-28 15:39:11,fqi2es,"Pretty bad mock for Denver. If Ruggs is gone, I like the Henderson pick. But that's about the knot thing I like about this mock. Broncos need a speedy wr, and Tee Higgins is pretty much the opposite of that. Plus they have a big need at iOL that doesnt get addressed at all. And taking an iDL when Hennesey is on the board in the 3rd makes no sense whatsoever."
206,2020-03-28 17:23:50,fqi2es,Jags would never trade up for that crap
207,2020-03-28 14:46:04,fqi2es,"Packers are definitely not taking a QB that early. We‚Äôd be kicking Rodgers out early due to the rookie contract being extremely valuable, and is a waste of a draft pick. 

Trading up for Reagor is also questionable. His draft stock went down due to combine performance, so he‚Äôd be there at 30, or there are very comparable talent at 30."
208,2020-03-28 14:57:40,fqi2es,Shenault plays way too similar of a role to Parris Campbell for it to make sense for us to draft him. Mims or Higgins would be much better fits that give us something our WR corps doesn't currently have.
209,2020-03-28 15:04:19,fqi2es,"Mock is pretty good for Seattle. YGM is a good pick in the first. I believe Seattle would prefer Julian Okwara at 59 rather than Zack Baun, as Baun is more of a 3-4 OLB, and Seattle needs a Leo. Arnette pick is awful, he has T-Rex arms. Seattle has never drafted a CB with shorter than 32‚Äù arms ever, and the earliest they have ever taken a CB is late 3rd. Plus, with the addition of Quinton Dunbar, CB is all but off the table for the first two days"
210,2020-03-28 15:39:42,fqi2es,"Baun is far too small to be a pass rusher in the NFL and he doesn't meet any of our linebacker athletic thresholds. If we needed another DE, we'd go Okwara probs. Though if we already went YGM in R1, Driscoll or another tackle (where we have zero young depth) is likely

Never say never but Seattle hasn't drafted a corner before the back end of the 3rd round under PCJS either, and we've never taken an outside corner with arms under 32"". We love our 2nd round receivers so Pittman or Johnson is possible there, Cushenberry also with needing to move on from Britt sooner rather than later."
211,2020-03-28 16:18:33,fqi2es,Pretty comical to see the Giants GM take a safety and watch the next two picks be a LB and a Center.
212,2020-03-28 18:07:54,fqi2es,"Man, I couldn't pass on this haul any harder. It's really objectively poor. Hamler would be a reach at 28 even in a less loaded class, then add to that Murray and Queen still on the board and that's a pick worthy of an F-. And the first sentence of the description is just wrong, a slot guy is exactly what we don't need at WR. Snead is a slot specialist and we use Hollywood and Andrews in the slot a ton as well. We need outside WRs, not slot."
213,2020-03-28 14:19:37,fqi2es,Would have loved a safety or Linebacker in there but I ain‚Äôt mad at this. We get two tackles and hopefully with Bill Callahan‚Äôs coaching we are set for the foreseeable future there and we also bolster our DL (would probably pick one and use the other pick on a safety). Good shit OP.
214,2020-03-28 14:26:15,fqi2es,I actually really like this for the Cardinals well done
215,2020-03-28 14:35:51,fqi2es,"Hate it. The Chiefs lost two starting corners. If they don‚Äôt come out of the draft with a starter, it‚Äôs a massive failure. Any mocker failing to recognize this has, in turn, provided us a shit mock."
216,2020-03-28 14:38:31,fqi2es,"Awful draft for the Browns. Nailed the first pick then whiffed on the next 3. The Browns signed Jack Conklin in FA. So unless you want Naing to kick into OG, that is an OT that's just going to gather dust as a backup for 3 years minimum. Getting one rotational edge might be nice, but Chad Thomas showed flashes last year. Not addressing FS at all without one on the roster in the first place is a massive misstep. The big needs for Cleveland atm are: LT, FS, LB, SS, RG, backup EDGE, 3rd WR, iDL depth, H-back in that order."
217,2020-03-28 17:13:33,fqi2es,"Love Kinlaw, the rest of this not so much. CB is by far our biggest need but you have us using ANOTHER 2nd round pick (remember the Falcons just traded a 2nd for Hurst) for a TE who easily is a 3rd/4th round talent, all while players like Bryce Hall and Noah Igbinoghene are still there."
218,2020-03-29 17:20:55,fqi2es,"Great draft for the lions, would prefer to stay put at 35 and take Mims (or maybe Austin Jackson) or take Aiyuk at 40 Bc I think both guys are gonna be studs"
219,2020-03-29 18:10:19,fqi2es,Don‚Äôt have much to say other than I really like what you did with the Cowboys picks. I‚Äôm SUPER high on Fulton so picking him at 20 is perfect for me
220,2020-04-02 09:16:03,fqi2es,"Love the draft for the Lions, although I think they would look to pick up a DT in the third over a CB or LB. The LB room is pretty full nowadays."
221,2020-03-28 17:48:13,fqi2es,"This, but I do love Kmet in the third"
222,2020-03-28 12:48:46,fqi2es,"Perhaps this is true but again, this is what I would do and I think Love is significantly better than any of those other guys and worth moving up for. They just resigned a whole bunch of guys and I feel this roster is definitely still ready to compete."
223,2020-03-28 12:53:33,fqi2es,"Yes, looking back on the Eason pick I'm not really a huge fan of it, but oh well. If anything should've taken an ILB with the Eason pick but I really like Reagor as a receiver and think he was well worth trading up for and Wilson in round 3 provides a replacement for Bulaga who you also lost to free agency."
224,2020-03-28 13:44:11,fqi2es,"I don't blame you, I nearly went Gladney at 32 but I think Queen is that much better so I took him. Dobbins felt like the BPA and a need for KC and then I thought Duvernay would get more of a role than any CB prospect available than in this very suspect CB class."
225,2020-03-28 12:59:04,fqi2es,"To be really honest, this was a poor pick from me. Totally forgot about Hurst and would've picked an Arnette or Jaylon Johnson. Sorry man"
226,2020-03-28 14:01:17,fqi2es,"At 1.29 it was BPA for me with the Titans. Didn‚Äôt realise the linebacking depth that the Titans had but don‚Äôt necessarily think Tennessee has ‚Äòone of the best‚Äô linebacking cores in the league. there wasn‚Äôt really anyone worth taking over Murray besides maybe Diggs? Besides with Murray now on the Titans, their linebacking core is no longer as you say ‚Äòone of the best‚Äô but now with Murray they are the ‚Äòbest‚Äô linebacking core in the league in your eyes."
227,2020-03-28 12:25:04,fqi2es,"Agree.  I like Hamler but there‚Äôs a 0% chance they take him in the 1st with Murray AND Queen on the board.

I do like the Marlon Davidson and Okwara picks tho."
228,2020-03-28 12:33:22,fqi2es,This is a very valid point and perhaps I should've gone Murray but I will say I think WR is the more pressing need - the Ravens d-line and safety core is outstanding and what will win them more games is drafting a speedy slot receiver that can consistently beat coverage. A WR class like this doesn't come around often and Lamar will greatly appreciate Hamler's skillset.
229,2020-03-28 12:43:32,fqi2es,I considered OT at pick 63 but I was more looking for value more than anything. I appreciate it‚Äôs an un-Seahawks pick but for me at least I was going BPA and for Arnette to still be available at the end of the 2nd when many view him as a top 40 player I figured I couldn‚Äôt pass up that value.
230,2020-03-28 13:40:54,fqi2es,"I think O-line (and maybe coaching?) is really all this team needs to be a playoff contender so I did choose to heavily invest in OT and take Niang who I've seen in the first round in some mocks at 41. Greenard was specifically to target EDGE and I really like his length and fit in Cleveland. Zuniga maybe could've been Davis (not a massive fan of Harrison) but for me, Zuniga felt like the BPA and I'd rather continue to build a monster d-line with a plethora of players I can rotate."
231,2020-03-28 14:48:54,fqi2es,"I‚Äôll let the packers gm answer as well but he‚Äôs going to agree that in hindsight, Eason wasn‚Äôt the best option. However we are both quite high on Reagor and will defend the trade up - I personally have Reagor at 18 on my big board (speed, hands, ball skills all amazing imo)"
232,2020-03-28 15:01:17,fqi2es,"I definitely disagree, I‚Äôm a fan of Campbell but he‚Äôs very much a speed threat in my mind. Shenault is much more of a all around athlete. Maybe Higgins is a good idea but I‚Äôm really not a fan of him that high."
233,2020-03-28 14:45:57,fqi2es,Thanks man
234,2020-03-28 14:37:02,fqi2es,I believe if you draft for need that‚Äôs a failure and no CB was worth taking at 32.
235,2020-03-28 14:45:47,fqi2es,"I really do think the Browns need the oline to work and then everything else will come together and this team can fulfil their potential. Yes FS is important but if it were my, I‚Äôd choose to invest heavily in the oline."
236,2020-03-28 18:41:08,fqi2es,Kmet making it to the 3rd would be a steal
237,2020-03-28 13:47:10,fqi2es,The question isn‚Äôt is love better than those other guys it‚Äôs is he better than NEXT years QBs who could be available and personally I don‚Äôt think so.
238,2020-03-28 13:13:15,fqi2es,"I don‚Äôt have a problem with drafting Reagon, but imo we could have drafted him at 30. And I like Wilson in the 3rd round"
239,2020-03-28 13:03:08,fqi2es,"I personally would prefer Eason over a Malik Harrison, for example."
240,2020-03-28 14:09:30,fqi2es,Agree to disagree.
241,2020-03-28 13:00:00,fqi2es,"It's fine, I frequently forget who needs what and who I sent where when I'm making my mocks too"
242,2020-03-28 17:12:51,fqi2es,"BPA only works if that player is able to get on the field. Brown, Evans and Long are all off-ball LBs - as is Murray. Teams spend most of their time these days in nickel packages - rarely do you ever see more than 3 off ball LBs on the field at once, and usually it's just 2. 

For a player to provide value, he needs to actually play. Murray is kind of a useless pick for TEN, A) he wouldn't play many snaps and B) he'd prevent a decent player from getting any snaps."
243,2020-03-28 12:29:47,fqi2es,"Yeah, I really like the Davidson and Okwara picks for us, just would change our 1st pick and its a really good draft."
244,2020-03-28 12:41:56,fqi2es,"While I agree that we do need another WR, our core WR group isn't as bad off as our LB group and if we want to cover TEs or RBs coming over the middle, stuffing the run, or blitzing like we do then we'll need that good coverage LB to go with Fort. Since this WRs class has a good amount of good players and the LBs group is okay, then I think we would take the LB in this situation. We also usually do BPA and going for K.J. Hamler in the 1st is a reach imo especially when you have Shenault and Mims going after him.

Overall great job on your mock draft!"
245,2020-03-28 14:53:31,fqi2es,"The defense in its current form is not a playoff contender, even with an improved OL and coaching staff. Our LB core currently consists of Mack Wilson who was below average, Sione Takitaki who played 100 snaps last season, and BJ Goodson who‚Äôs an aging vet that probably qualifies as serviceable. We don‚Äôt even have a FS on the roster. I get the premise of a monster DL but there‚Äôs only so much a DL can do when your back 7 is as bad as the Browns back 7 is currently slated to be. You‚Äôre relying heavily on both Takitaki and Wilson making a huge jump and one of Sendejo or Sheldrick Redwine to be a serviceable FS."
246,2020-03-28 15:32:11,fqi2es,"I meant more in the role they play. Campbell and Shenault are both more gadget/slot receivers, even though they do it in very different ways. We need someone that can be more of a downfield threat than either of them, and our WR corps has been lacking a good, big body receiver for a long time."
247,2020-03-28 14:38:25,fqi2es,"Then you‚Äôre suggesting that the Chiefs are going in to 2020 with two starting positions unfilled. Don‚Äôt be ridiculous. There are plenty of quality corners you skipped over.

Edit: you picked Gladney 5 picks after the Chiefs first. You picked Arnette and Hall in the immediate picks after their second. 

Another point of order, the Chiefs will NOT invest in a high round selection at running back. It simply will not happen."
248,2020-03-28 14:50:40,fqi2es,"Yes but they did invest heavily on the OL in FA. The signed one of the best RTs in the NFL to play RT. Drafting Thomas would fill the LT spot. Then you have an OL of Thomas, Bitonio, Tretter, Forbes/Teller/Hubbard, and Conklin. The point is drafting Niang is a wasted pick as unless you're putting him at RG, which I would never do. Now if you think that they need to address the RG spot, then someone like Ruiz or Bidiaz at 41 makes sense. But it would be better to fill the FS spot at 41, take a LB or SS at 74 and then nab Lemieux at 97."
249,2020-03-28 13:49:59,fqi2es,"Love would be great in next year's class as well but if it is me running the team like I'm doing in this mock, I'll take Love and not wait a year with this loaded defense."
250,2020-03-28 13:52:14,fqi2es,"Also factoring into this is that I, personally am not a fan of Stidham. Graded him 6th round last year - don't think he's the answer but not obviously the Pats did so what do I know lol"
251,2020-03-28 13:16:47,fqi2es,He might've been there. This receiving class is stacked and we had 6 receivers go in the first so was more a matter of ensuring I got the guy that I wanted.
252,2020-03-28 14:11:23,fqi2es,As in I don‚Äôt blame you for having a problem with not picking a corner- obviously more of a need than CB. Was just trying to explain the opportunity never arose.
253,2020-03-28 13:10:31,fqi2es,"You guys are probably right, I think in hindsight LB is the smarter pick. As for BPA, my personal opinion is Hamler was the best player available because his ball skills and hands are amazing and a team like Baltimore could really use a speedy guy like him. I guess I was excited about the fit I conceptualized and overlooked the true need."
254,2020-03-28 14:59:05,fqi2es,Yeah in hindsight I would‚Äôve gone win field at 41 and then RG and LB/SS with 74 and 97. I do think there‚Äôs some merit to OL but the defence does need help.
255,2020-03-28 15:33:51,fqi2es,Right you mean more of a Justin Jefferson/lamb kind of player
256,2020-03-28 15:34:21,fqi2es,Probably could‚Äôve thought about WR type a bit more
257,2020-03-28 14:43:33,fqi2es,Would rather have queen then Gladney or Diggs and Jaylon Johnson vs Dobbins was a very hard choice but I ended up going with the BPA.
258,2020-03-28 14:57:01,fqi2es,"I think in hindsight what I‚Äôd do is take winfield at 41, Hennessy at 74 and a Lb like Dye at 97. What do you think?"
259,2020-03-28 21:07:53,fqi2es,"> they can‚Äôt waste this still excellent roster with Brian Hoyer or Jarrett Stidham at QB

This quote and this comment suggest there's a pretty strong disconnect between where you see the Patriots and where I see the Patriots.  
  
We've lost 2,700 snaps on defense between Van Noy, Collins, Harmon and Shelton. We have nobody signed to play EDGE LB right now, and we don't have the personnel to transition back to a 4-3 base (we'd need to add a few DL and that move would alienate Chase Winovich). This ""loaded"" defense is, in reality, a loaded secondary (with genuine age/injury concerns at safety) and a skeleton crew front 7. That is, a front 7 that got ran over for 200 yards the last time it was on the field and then lost KVN, Collins and Danny Shelton.   
  
That secondary should be good enough to produce a decent to good final product on defense, but replicating last year's results (which were amplified by a comically weak schedule and preying on young, inexperienced or outright bad QBs - Rosen, Falk, McCoy, Jones, Darnold, Baker, Dalton - then returned merely ""very good"" results against teams with respectable offenses) is an impossible task, and that's what it's going to take if the team is going to compete because the offense could be one of the worst in the league. It's a good OL if everyone is healthy (that includes getting an all clear on David Andrews that we still don't have, and if we don't get it we have no center), it's a solid if unspectacular RB group and.... that's it. The TE situation is the worst in the NFL, the WR group is among the worst in the NFL and whoever the QB ends up being will be asked to make up for that.
  
All told it's massive, immediate needs at EDGE, TE, WR with slightly less immediate needs at LB, DL and S that will become glaring if we don't take steps to get ahead of the problem and a potential for immediate need at Center pending results of medical testing for Andrews, who will not have played football in 18 months by the time the season rolls around.  

You and I very clearly have different opinions on Love, so while I don't want to just assume I'm right and you're wrong about him, what exactly is it that you see that makes him worth a future first, a third and a fourth for a team that has significant and immediate needs at so many other positions? I've been going crazy seeing him mocked to us so often down at 23, but paying up a future 1st and two other picks in the top 4 rounds just on the prayer that he can be good enough as a rookie when thrown into such a terrible offensive situation to not waste a year of the aging and shallow defense is the kind of thing that can set a franchise back half a decade or more."
260,2020-03-28 14:15:13,fqi2es,"Well that isn‚Äôt quite true. You just chose RB instead. I understand as that is perceived from the outside as a position of need for the Chiefs. Within the organization though, I don‚Äôt get that feeling. Reid doesn‚Äôt invest high picks there as the guys that fit his system generally are available later in the draft."
261,2020-03-28 13:13:24,fqi2es,"That's the fun of doing mocks, fitting players with teams we think they would have the best chance of succeeding or just because you want to build teams for a future dynasty. Great job and keep up the good work!"
262,2020-03-28 15:07:56,fqi2es,"Yeah don‚Äôt get me wrong, the OL still needs depth in a bad way. If one player goes down there really isn‚Äôt serviceable backup at any position. Just with the signing of Conklin I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs quite as pressing to go back to back on OT in the 1st two rounds"
263,2020-03-28 14:48:12,fqi2es,"Then your mock leaves the Chiefs fielding 9 defenders. They have no starters except Charvarious Ward. Rashad Fenton is a 6th round selection from last season that played a lot at slot once injuries hit the unit. They have no other drafted talent among their corners. Mark it down, the Chiefs will address this spot and any mocker that fails to recognize this is not giving their best effort. Your round two choice needed to go to Arnette or Hall or Igbinoghene, none of which are reaches."
264,2020-03-28 15:00:57,fqi2es,"Not bad, personally I would go with your board Winnfield at 41, Chinn at 74, and Lemieux at 97. Then look at LBs in the 4th since we have an early 4th rounder. Although I wouldn't be upset with Winnfield at 41, Davis Gaither at 74, and Lemieux at 97 with eyes on SS in R4."
265,2020-03-28 23:48:38,fqi2es,">You and I very clearly have different opinions on Love, so while I don't want to just assume I'm right and you're wrong about him, what exactly is it that you see that makes him worth a future first, a third and a fourth for a team that has significant and immediate needs at so many other positions?

This, especially given that Stidham at least had two years in the SEC, vs. Love in the Mountain West."
266,2020-03-28 15:32:52,fqi2es,Yeah this is a fair point. The idea of a Hall or a similar CB there is quite appealing as well.
267,2020-03-28 13:13:57,fqi2es,Thanks man
268,2020-03-28 15:10:13,fqi2es,"This is probably where our fundamental disagreement is but I‚Äôm sure you know more about this team as I‚Äôve only realised just how weak S, LB truly is."
269,2020-03-28 14:53:04,fqi2es,"Firstly Ward is very underrated. Also I admit, CB is definitely a need they will be addressing, just didn‚Äôt work out in this one. The idea of Dobbins enticed me but you‚Äôre right someone like Hall is probably the better pick."
270,2020-03-28 15:02:21,fqi2es,China has some question marks in my mind and so does Davis Gaither. Both too high for me at 74.
271,2020-03-28 15:03:11,fqi2es,Ended up picking Chinn around 90 and still feeling iffy about that
272,2020-03-28 15:49:19,fqi2es,"Yeah safety and LB are pretty dire. At the price he signed for in JAX I think many Browns fans would‚Äôve preferred we resigned Schobert to shore up the LB room. As far as FS goes in FA, we could still opt to bring back Randall but there seems to be some bad blood there after some locker room issues last year. I‚Äôd prefer we address one of those two in FA still so we can focus more on BPA in the middle rounds"
273,2020-03-28 15:12:55,fqi2es,"One last point. The Chiefs have the second fewest dollars devoted to corners in the league (the Panthers are worse). Their highest paid corner is the journeyman they just signed, Antonio Hamilton, a guy who is known for his play on special teams, not his corner play. Veach will rebalance the roster, expending less on wideouts and more on corners."
274,2020-03-28 15:04:02,fqi2es,"Unfortunately based on your board there isn't a ton of need meets talent. I'm a huge fan of Chinn and Davis Gaither, and wouldn't mind getting one of them before 97, when both would be gone."
275,2020-03-28 15:15:14,fqi2es,Also the chiefs have the least cap space left of any team so even more important they address corner in draft.
276,2020-03-28 15:05:46,fqi2es,Would prefer Brandon Jones over chinn. I‚Äôm planning to watch more games of chinn soon.
277,2020-03-28 15:10:41,fqi2es,"I just don't see a massive need to take a WR for Cleveland. We have OBJ and Landry a couple decent bottom of the roster guys like Hodge and Ratley. We could use a 3rd WR, but Stefanski isn't much for 3 WR sets hence why Hooper was a prime FA target in Cleveland. Personally, with Karl Joseph on a 1y deal, and the rise of Nickel defenses playing 3 safties I think it's necessary to get a 3rd safety we feel comfortable with. I wouldn't hate Ashyton Davis at 41 either as you could put Winnfield as the slot safety on nickel packages and bring Davis to play the high safety"
278,2020-03-28 15:13:35,fqi2es,Brandon Jones the Safety from Texas
279,2020-03-28 15:14:28,fqi2es,Ah ok yeah got him mixed up with Colin Johnson

If they were coming back, i doubt they would just post something like that. 

I Could see a lot of the bands returning, but i doubt the conversation was like ""hey sorry Macca, we've had to cancel, but its ok because you've been put down for next year instead"""
340,2020-04-21 12:56:59,g5ecac,"Honestly I don't see how the festival can go ahead in 2021. It takes around 18 months to develop a vaccine. It's not realistic to expect mass gatherings before then.

If not, what line-up could be?"
348,2020-04-21 13:48:20,g5ecac,"By the time there's a vaccine, most people may have already had this. I'd say it's more likely we see a huge increase in testing to find out how many have actually been affected. 2021 is definitely up in the air, but it isn't off the table quite yet."

351,2020-04-22 11:46:12,g5ecac,Potentially. I haven‚Äôt seen anything directly linking them so I am not going to add them to the page yet. Yes they hinted that they would be doing Glasto in the future but it‚Äôs not clear yet what plans have changed due to covid-19. I feel like everything before the cancellation could be thrown out the window to accommodate a reschedule.
352,2020-04-25 09:42:46,g5ecac,There‚Äôs a chance of both. I won‚Äôt be surprised if Macca leaves it a bit before signing on though. Even if he intends to play I think he will wait a bit before committing.
353,2020-05-23 15:59:37,g5ecac,Very excited for Paul. Not so much the others.
354,2020-04-24 21:50:51,g5ecac,"I literally loved the line-up this year. I mean Taylor could of easily been replaced with a great band. But Kendrick Lamar is a perfect pick and Paul McCartney is a decent pick too.

I mean the rest of the line up was amazing too, Thom Yorke was playing!!"
355,2020-04-21 18:24:33,g5ecac,No Arctic Monkeys mate. Any festival without arctic monkeys is a disappointment on social media.
356,2020-04-21 14:05:03,g5ecac,"There seems to be mixed reports and evidence about whether catching Covid provides you with immunity from catching it again. If you can't catch it twice then it is possible we have herd immunity by June 2021.

Testing will definitely help us get on top of things, but if it turns out 1 person had Glastonbury had it, how do you work out which of the 160,000 other people there were in contact with them? I doubt it would be feasible to test everyone."
357,2020-04-21 14:01:07,g5ecac,"I doubt we will stay in total lock down for that long, but I still think large scale events are a long way off."
358,2020-04-22 11:48:12,g5ecac,"I‚Äôd love to see it personally, massive fan of the band. I also think they‚Äôre one of the most deserving acts of it at the moment."
359,2020-04-21 20:30:14,g5ecac,"I was a fan of the lineup they had for this year, but if AM end up playing then it would about quadruple my hype."
360,2020-04-21 14:07:31,g5ecac,"Yeah it really comes down to if you can have it more than once or not. Realistically, if they think they can host the event without causing major stress on the medical system, it will probably go ahead. I sure hope it does, just not so I can finally go to Glasto, but so we know this shit is not still going on at the same level it is now."
361,2020-04-22 11:50:23,g5ecac,If they announce dates around glasto 2021 I‚Äôl add them in.
362,2020-04-22 09:26:44,g5ecac,I don‚Äôt know why my comment got downvoted. I am an AM fan and I‚Äôve seen them many times. I quite enjoy seeing them live. But die hard AM fans need to realise that a festival without AM doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a bad festival.

Hello, 

I've been thinking about this for a while. 

Back in 2009, I was in college and the Kanye West ""Imma let you finish"" meme was in full swing and a huge running joke on my campus. My friend and I basically went as the meme: we printed out pictures of Taylor Swift and Kanye West's face and glued it to cereal boxes, cut out the eyes and wore it as masks on Halloween. I also had a polo shirt with a popped collar and a handmade microphone. I didn't really get any push back that evening (the only criticism I got is that the costume was kind of lazy, but even so a lot of people enjoyed it and we were asked to do the bit several times at each party, even found a Beyonce or two to play off of). I went to a fairly mixed race school in NYC.

This probably goes without saying, but I'm white. I've been trying to challenge myself on my past unintentional transgressions against the black community. The definition of blackface is kind of changing now, but I've always known it's wrong to have a costume of a race stereotype (being a generic ""black person"" or ""Mexican"") and usually the controversy is about wearing makeup (if you look it up online, those are most of the references you find). Here, I was trying to be a specific celebrity from a specific pop culture moment, and cut out the mask like I would have for any celebrity (my friends and I used to do this for group costumes from a particular movie, like Back to the Future or Grease). This celebrity though, was a different race than me.

Mask basically looked like this one:

[https://www.unwelcomegreetings.com/products/happy-kanye-west-mask-perfect-for-halloween-costume-party-mask-masquerades-parties-festivals-concerts-jumbo-size-waterproof-laminated-mask?variant=17514727425](https://www.unwelcomegreetings.com/products/happy-kanye-west-mask-perfect-for-halloween-costume-party-mask-masquerades-parties-festivals-concerts-jumbo-size-waterproof-laminated-mask?variant=17514727425)

Regardless of the answer here, I would never do it again, since even the chance someone could be offended by it is meaningful enough for me to just find a different costume. 

tldr: Are wearing masks of black celebrities blackface? AITA?

416,2020-05-05 03:03:47,gcrwjd,"You're a stronger person than maybe you realize. I lost my mom to heart disease and after my first listen to the Lover album, I knew I'd never be able to listen to that song again. I've been a big fan of Taylor for a few years now, but not a big enough one to know that song was about her mom battling cancer. I honestly just thought she was being creative and wrote the song without any experience on watching someone fight a battle like that (dumb of me I know) After hearing it, I just broke down and anytime I even think of the line ""And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to? What am I supposed to do if there's no you?"" It just hits so close to home bc that's exactly how I've felt since she died 5 years ago. It doesn't get easier. 

But, I do think of this song and a few others when Taylor gets categorized as the queen of the break up songs. She clearly can write so much more than that.  But, seriously, what's the most universal heartbreak? What's something EVERY songwriter has written about at least a dozen, if not more, times? Everybody has been thru a breakup so everybody can relate to it. The thing I find most frustrating is people ignore her music bc of this need to be petty or seem more dimensional (ew you like Taylor Swift? Her music is so childish) and these people are missing out on some really beautiful lyrics bc the only ones they've heard are her radio releases."

750,2020-05-03 20:25:25,gcqsjk,Nothing about his response indicates he‚Äôs furious about it. I assume you only read the headline about this and not the article. He seems to find it funny and confusing mainly.

Not to be a dick, I'm just sick of the Bansky syndrome people seem to suffer from, ""when it's nice to look at I love graffiti but I hate that tagging stuff"".

868,2020-06-26 17:55:24,hg8e51,"Unpopular Opinion: The 1975 is this most bland indie rock band out there. I literally can never tell when one song ends and the other begins. I'm sooorryyyyy!!!!

but.... I really hope and truly want her next album to be more indie pop rock. I think its fair to say her fanbase is older now and it would appeal to the masses more. I also think moving in that direction would open the door to more Grammy's (not to say grammys are super important). 1989 hit all the marks for pop albums, Reputation is criminally underrated but I think with these 2 albums she's proven shes the ultimate pop queen. I think she needs to go conquer a new sliver of music because just like with country, shes already topped it all in pop. This is a hot take, I know. I'm sorry."
869,2020-06-26 17:30:28,hg8e51,"I would die for this. They‚Äôre my two top favorites. I want a beautiful slow acoustic song. I love Matty, and feel he and Taylor have similar views on the importance of keeping their songwriting very personal, but their lives are very private. It would be a gorgeous song!!! I don‚Äôt think this would ever happen though, and I can‚Äôt quite  imagine their voices together."
870,2020-06-26 15:00:26,hg8e51,"Personally, I hope not. I like some of The 1975‚Äôs songs and they‚Äôre good musicians but I despise Matty Healy. And I hope that her next collaboration is with a female artist. But, it‚Äôs definitely possible!"
871,2020-06-26 21:01:42,hg8e51,"I can't see this ever happening. Taylor may be polite to him in public, but after the things he's said about her, I doubt she would ever want to work with him. And personally I wouldn't want it to since he's a pretentious misogynist.

It may seem like he's complimentary of Taylor on the surface, but everything he's said about her is extremely condescending and sexist."
872,2020-06-28 01:28:11,hg8e51,"with all due respect, there‚Äôs absolutely zero speculation that TS8 will be rock oriented. It‚Äôs what some fans want, but there‚Äôs nothing to suggest that it‚Äôs actually happening. big difference between wishes and clues"
873,2020-07-26 13:34:41,hg8e51,Matty is William Bowery.
874,2020-06-28 01:31:04,hg8e51,"Strongly disagree sorry! Haha

She‚Äôs only done 3 pop albums and all 3 are relatively in that synth-pop world in varying degrees. There is so much left for her to explore. So many artists have built their entire careers off pop music and have made 15+ albums all in different sub-genres. Taylor is far from done with pop, with only 3 albums!"
875,2020-06-26 18:13:00,hg8e51,I get that. Their songs tend to be growers but when you finally get into them it's the most beautiful thing ever. I want them to collab with Taylor because of their unique and exquisite production (e.g. I Always Wanna Die Sometimes).
876,2020-06-26 18:13:11,hg8e51,I could imagine her voice fitting really well on a song like Jesus Christ 2005 God Bless America. I'd love it at least if The 1975 were guests at a tour stop-seeing Taylor sing It's Not Living If It's Not With You or If You're Too Shy would probably kill me.
877,2020-06-26 18:19:08,hg8e51,"They're my two top faves right now too! Matty did say he ""wants to produce"" Taylor's next album so it doesn't necessarily mean he's going to lend his voice on their collab, if there will be one lol."
878,2020-06-26 15:25:48,hg8e51,"Agreed! I do like The 1975 - they have quite a lot of good songs; but I'm not a fan of the whole ""edgy for the sake of being edgy"" thing anymore."
879,2020-06-26 15:23:02,hg8e51,I agree Taylor needs to collab with more female artists! But why do you hate matty?
880,2020-06-27 15:35:03,hg8e51,"I enjoy some of the 1975‚Äôs songs as well, and they‚Äôre really good performers; however, if you read into Matty Healy‚Äôs interviews, he comes off as very condescending. All the times that Taylor has been brought up in an interview, it‚Äôs a backhanded compliment. He mentioned that he wouldn‚Äôt never want to be labeled as ‚ÄúTaylor Swift‚Äôs boyfriend/ex-boyfriend‚Äù and said ‚Äúfuck that‚Äù around the time those pictures came out. Their song ‚ÄúChange of Heart‚Äù is supposed to be about her and some other girls."
881,2020-06-28 01:32:45,hg8e51,Why do I feel like Ariana Grande is the go-to female artist if you want a guaranteed top 5 (if not #1) hit
882,2020-06-28 02:41:15,hg8e51,"well, speculation is ""the forming of a theory or conjecture without firm evidence"" so I figured it still counts as speculation even though it came entirely from the wild imagination of fans. but you're right, Taylor had given absolutely no hints that her next project will head that way."
883,2020-07-26 14:34:00,hg8e51,am i crazy or does betty lowkey sound like a slowed down me & you together song? lol
884,2020-06-26 15:38:49,hg8e51,"Hate was probably a strong word but overall some of the things he‚Äôs said have been kind of gross. And while I think he‚Äôs a fan of Taylor, he said some stuff about her that has made me a little iffy.

Edit: here‚Äôs something he said last year about Taylor that made me roll my eyes a little: https://path-of-my-childhood.tumblr.com/post/187918850141/i-think-you-kinda-see-it-little-bit-with-taylor"

923,2020-06-26 22:53:41,hg5icy,I am with you.  I am not the biggest fan of Taylor. Like don't get me wrong. I am not going to say that she is not attractive. She is just not that attractive. I give her a solid 8/10. Some ppl act like she is a 15/10
924,2020-06-27 03:49:16,hg5icy,"Why do I think it's an unpopular opinion or why do I think she doesn't do it for me?

I think it's unpopular because she shows up in a lot of these. 

As to the other, I would echo what someone above said. It's not really that she's unattractive to me. She just doesn't do it for me like some other celebs do. I'm a butt guy, and hers just seems flat in a lot of pics. Plus there's just something about her face that I can't put my finger on that takes her out of my list. That said I totally get that people have different tastes and I could see where guys would disagree. She does have nice legs but the only leg girl that really does it for me is Karen Gillan. But I like redheads a lot."

926,2020-06-26 11:20:36,hg564a,"Even us rednecks mock rednecks. I come from a very long line of hillbillies and rednecks and I know for a fact that they're good people. A bit trashy, but they'd give their shirt off their back to someone in need.

This also might be a stereotype, but I've found that they'll feed anyone of any race or religion without question. It might be a little awkward, as they will ask a bunch of blunt questions, but at least it's genuine curiosity."
927,2020-06-26 11:51:03,hg564a,"Pretty sure rednecks are on Reddit's list of approved stereotypes, somewhere just above nice guys but below Karens. Many people complain about stereotypes while still feeling perfectly justified in using the popular ones. 

I don't know if there's any large platform that *doesn't* become some degree of toxic echo chamber, eventually."

My mom is always mocking the south for it being super racist and ignorant but you will find the same ignorance up north. Ignorance is ignorance. Honestly some of the kindest people I've met were rednecks and they were my neighbors and they helped us with a lot growing up. I don't know why people act like there aren't good and bad in everything.

You could live up north and be not consciously racist but have no friends of any kind of color or diversity. You could live in the south and be a confederate flag toting bigot. You could also not!"

Just because someone flies the confederate flag doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre racists. People could actually learn A LOT if they actually studied the Confederacy and all of the different flags that were flown, not just the battle flag. I live in the South and am proud to have been raised in a simpler way than most city people."
933,2020-06-26 11:44:59,hg564a,"I have to say, OP your comment spoke to me. I couldn't agree with you more. 

I have friends and family in ""The South"" that are pickup drivin, gun-totin, NASCAR watchin, Confederate flag wavin, and more. 

They personify just about every southerner stereotype you can think of, INCLUDING being the first to give you their last dollar If you need help. 

Being blunt is just their way (and I truthfully wish more people would be that way). These are without question some of the kindest, most good-hearted people I've ever met.

From what I've seen, they could care less about the derogatory depiction in the media and just shake their heads with a ""bless their hearts"" attitude (southern-ese for ""fucking idiots"" - they even cuss with class!) and go about their business.

Kudos to your open-mindedness. Respect."
934,2020-06-26 14:42:58,hg564a,"My boyfriend is from down south. I'm from New York. While I can't speak about racism specifically,  I have noticed that down south people tend to be generally nicer and more accepting. Everyone I've met refrains from judging or mocking. The same cannot be said for people from the North. The amount of comments I get when I say my boyfriend is from the South is ridiculous. No, just because you're from the south doesn't mean you're racist or that you banged your cousin."

We may be stupid and all that, but at least we know how to make our society work.

The kind and warmhearted Southerners welcome them with open arms, but unfortunately they come down here and vote for what they fled from.

I know ill probably get a ton of downvotes for what ive posted.  But everyone can plainly see its true."
944,2020-06-26 15:13:03,hg564a,"I enjoyed your post OP.  I live in MS although I wasn't born here.  And although the stereotypes do exist for a reason, it's not like everybody in the south fits the description.   

I think people on reddit in particular get so stuck on the stereotypes and the Confederate flag that they're blinded to everything else.   

When I was younger I actually saw KKK rallies.   I saw mixed race couples walk into stores and restaurants and get told to leave.   If a black person walked into a white neighborhood they would be surrounded and questioned about their intentions almost immediately.   

As my generation came of age that has all changed.  Mixed race couples are normal and aren't treated any differently.   When I see kids playing together now it's not unusual to see other races in the group.   Neighborhoods that used to be segregated are now thoroughly mixed.  I haven't seen a KKK rally or white supremacist in over 30  years.

But when I have traveled back up north, racism there is the same (and sometimes worse) than it used to be.   The societies there seem to have not really been challenged in the same way.   I think for some southerners the process is probably comparable to what Germans experienced in the generations after the holocaust.   Once you quit being indoctrinated and see what your ancestors did, you have no choice but to finally deal with it head on.

I think the south is ahead of the rest of the country on the race issue in many ways, but it's not obvious to people who don't visit the region.   Not that the issue is solved mind you."

951,2020-06-26 15:42:51,hg564a,"As someone from Mississippi, I sorta-kinda agree. I was born and raised in this state, and while I will agree that I RARELY see any racism, if at all, I do see a lot of... ignorance, and cruelty.

We're not exactly known for education or animal well-fare, for example. I've seen some real messed up shit in areas as public as a gas station parking lot. And going onto Facebook to check up on my family members is almost always a headache, especially these days with all the politics and COVID."
952,2020-06-26 18:00:28,hg564a,"I agree, it's an unfortunate stereotype that comes down to classism at best. If anything, thinking that Southerners are dumb should compel people to want to improve the South's education system (well, the whole of American education needs help, really) and reading ""trashiness"" as a synonym for being lower class should compel them to take measures to improve people's lives as opposed to mocking them."

954,2020-06-26 11:35:11,hg564a,Rednecks actually have a sense of humor and can laugh at themselves. You'd never get away with mocking the blue haired alt-left types on mainstream media.
955,2020-06-26 22:22:21,hg564a,"Okay, so I may not be exactly a southerner, but I am a hillbilly... I guess. First off, where I am from the town has been pretty heavily influenced by drugs, and my town doesn't appear to be as communal as other parts of the south. From my experience, if your a stranger in my area, you will be dealt with with the same type of suspicion as you would be up north. People seem to only really help in my town the people that they know. But when it comes to Mississippi? That's different.

First off, southerners are often called racist. You should look up Masaman's ethnic map of the world, what you should notice when you look at the south is the *Massive* amount of black people in the south. You hear about racism in cities in the north and in Atlanta, but how often do you hear about racism in the black-dominated counties of eastern Mississippi? In my experience in Mississippi, I have seen inter-racial relationships and marriages, black people worshipping with white people, and some weird religious cult-looking churches that are usually dominated by one race (Black or white). Is there racism in Mississippi? Yes. Is Mississippi racist? Not from my experience going down there annually. The thing is, when you go to the deep south, in the rural areas, it seems like black people and white people have the *same* culture and consider themselves the *same* race. Southerners seem to place *less* importance on the color of someone's skin than the democrat party. In urban areas, I am somewhat afraid of black people, just being honest, it seems like that is where the crime is happening and blacks seem to do alot of it (from the coverage I see). But in Mississippi? I don't remember a crime in the town I usually go to, everyone seems nice, and I wonder more about what people with Texas license plates are doing in such a backwater place than anything else.

Facts people should remember:

1. Many abolitionists lived in the south and were part of the underground railroad.
2. There was an abolitionist revolt during the civil war in Jones county Mississippi led by a poor white farmer named Newton Knight that was able to survive till the very end of the civil war.
3. MLK. Jr. had his primary cultural impact *in the south*, or, do you know who essentially treats MLK jr. as a practical saint? Southern Baptists, just, practically every Christian I know in the south thinks of him as a man of God.
4. Religion was used to justify slavery (the curse of Ham (actually Canaan)), but it was also the driving force behind ending slavery (Christ died for all).
5. Many southerners are against BLM, sure. Many black southerners are against BLM.
6. Wait, why aren't you hearing about the racism in the south anymore?
7. The only reason the confederate flag is popular is because it is *the only good-looking flag that is able to represent the south as a whole.*
8. MLK Jr. was a *Southern Baptist*."
956,2020-06-26 23:02:30,hg564a,"Same with farmers. A lot of people I talk to online feel like farmers are mostly uneducated, trailer trash. When I‚Äôm on Stack Overflow, almost everyone questions if I‚Äôm actually a farmer and that ‚Äúwhy does a farmer know SQL, Python, and React.js‚Äù.

957,2020-06-27 01:20:18,hg564a,"This is a huge issue when anyone starts talking about any group. The most extreme members of that group become the representation of the entire group.

People think that if you‚Äôre conservative, you must be sexist, racist, or homophobic because the more extreme people in that group are those things. If you are elderly, people think of you as crotchety and sensitive and grumpy because the more extreme types of elderly people are. Groups are always represented by their most extreme members, and we really need to start raising awareness of this fallacy in thinking and pushing to change it because it creates a lot of issues that are based on generalization"

You maybe had enough teeth for a single mouth between the lot of them. Harley motorcycles, smoking like chimneys, mullets... You name it. Not once did any of them show the slightist incling of any racism to Jim, or any black customers that came our way not even once.

That was pretty much the experience my friends and I got when we drove across the US about a decade ago.  

I'm white, but these guys were a mix of black, asian & pacific islander. In the cities, we all got hate for various reasons.  We were in uniform only some of the time (British army).  Often it was directed at the black guys, but we all got it.  Even me, for being white!  It wasn't just that, either.  There was general dickishness about the people in the various cities we passed through.

1062,2020-06-27 04:09:14,hg564a,"I‚Äôve heard the ‚Äúthe south is bringing down the nation‚Äù argument quite a bit, and I feel there is a relatively simple explanation. The south is EXTREMELY resource rich. That may seem illogical why an area with a vast excess of resources has more poverty and lower educational amounts, but that‚Äôs because most of the time the money doesn‚Äôt stay here.

For example, I live near Houston area. There is a very large amount of oil refineries, a large portion of them owned by Exxon. The thing is that money doesn‚Äôt stay here.

Refineries have oil shipped in from rigs, but the access to the Gulf of Mexico makes their location extremely valuable.

Ever heard of a place called Pascagoula MS? It‚Äôs a run down city with poor infrastructure, and a lot of people born there don‚Äôt leave just because they can‚Äôt. You know what else is there? One of the largest oil refineries in the nation that employs quite a few people from other towns nearly. However, that refinery is owned by Chevron, so the profits go to California, making California look good. Most people I knew at the time either worked there or at one of the TWO shipbuilding facilities for the US navy. 

The list goes on and on, but I doubt you want to listen to me list off oil, natural gas, and chemical facilities for the next half hour. Also, the south produces a ton of agricultural products, from what I‚Äôve seen a lot of cotton, fish, and peanuts, but those don‚Äôt generally make people rich so they don‚Äôt look good when you look at the south‚Äôs average wealth.

A there is less higher education, but a lot of that is explained too. Many people will get just enough education to get an entry level job at one of those big facilities (usually an associates or trade school), then work their way up. One of the 5 people managing the entire chevron refinery in MS got certified as a welder, then worked his way up. 

Also yes, the south doesn‚Äôt have as many people going to law or medical school, but it has many more job opportunities for engineering majors compared to other parts of the nation (due to all the industry around). I lived in a one stop light town in the middle of nowhere (about 45 minutes from Pascagoula) and around 50% of the people‚Äôs parents I went to school with were engineers.

So I‚Äôd say that in a lot of ways the south definitely pulls its own weight, but they usually don‚Äôt reap the benefits of it."

But, because the North had started the industrial revolution, the south was told that all the wealth would goto the north, and their machines theyre forcing on everybody.

But ask yourself this: why are so many black people left poor in the inner city areas while so many white families live in the suburbs? Why are so many hard working black man working for 9$ an hour or less?
Well in my opinion it's (not exclusively, but definitely in large part) due to the lack of opportunity given to them. I'm neither for blaming everybody else for your mistakes nor do i care for hate against white people but i think there are things that could be done differently in this society and it's not firing white actors from black roles but actual societal changes mainly an education reform."

Extensive document on racial biases in our criminal justice system.
Studies seem to indicate about 61-80% of black overrepresentation in prisons can be explained by higher black crime rates, with the unexplained portion largely attributable to racial bias.

https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/ferguson_police_department_report.pdf
Between 2012 and 2014, black people in Ferguson accounted for 85 percent of vehicle stops, 90 percent of citations and 93 percent of arrests, despite comprising 67 percent of the population.
Blacks were more than twice as likely as whites to be searched after traffic stops even after controlling for related variables, though they proved to be 26 percent less likely to be in possession of illegal drugs or weapons.
Between 2011 and 2013, blacks also received 95 percent of jaywalking tickets and 94 percent of tickets for ‚Äúfailure to comply.‚Äù The Justice Department also found that the racial discrepancy for speeding tickets increased dramatically when researchers looked at tickets based on only an officer‚Äôs word vs. tickets based on objective evidence, such as a radar.
Black people facing similar low-level charges as white people were 68 percent less likely to see those charges dismissed in court. More than 90 percent of the arrest warrants stemming from failure to pay/failure to appear were issued for black people.

http://www.justicepolicy.org/uploads/justicepolicy/documents/vortex.pdf

While White & Black Americans admit to using and selling illicit drugs at similar rates, Black Americans are VASTLY more likely to go to prison for a drug offense.
In 2002, Black Americans were incarcerated for drug offenses at TEN TIMES the rate of White Americans.
Today, Blacks are 3.7x as likely to be arrested for a marijuana offense as Whites, despite similar usage.
97% of ‚Äúlarge-population counties‚Äù have racial biases in their drug offense incarceration.

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.05376.pdf

Analysis of 4.5 million traffic stops in North Carolina shows blacks and latinos were more likely to be searched than whites (5.4 percent, 4.1 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively).
Despite this, searches of white motorists were the most likely to reveal contraband (32% of whites, 29% of blacks, 19% of latinos).

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0858-1.pdf
Enormous study of nearly 100,000,000 traffic stops conducted across America.
Analysis finds the bar for searching black and hispanic drivers‚Äô cars is significantly lower than the bar for white drivers.
Additionally, black drivers are less likely to be pulled over after sunset, when ‚Äúa ‚Äòveil of darkness‚Äô masks ones‚Äô race‚Äù.

https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/research-publications/2017/20171114_Demographics.pdf

Extensive multivariate regression analysis indicates black male offenders receive 19.1% longer federal sentences than similarly-situated white male offenders (white male offenders with similar past offenses, socioeconomic background, etc.)
This disparity seems to stem mostly from black males being 21.2% less likely to receive non-government sponsored downward departures or variances.
Non-government sponsored departures and variances refer to deviations from standard sentencing guidelines due to judicial discretion.
Black males who do receive non government-sponsored departures and variations still serve 16.8% longer sentences than white males on average.
In contrast, when sentencing length follows standard guidelines, that disparity is only 7.9%, and a substantial assistance departure for both groups nullifies that disparity.
IN SUMMARY - much of the sentencing disparity between similarly situated black males and white males comes down to judicial discretion to deviate from standard sentencing guidelines.
BONUS - regression analysis suggests violence in a criminal‚Äôs history does NOT explain sentencing disparities between black males and similarly situated white males - the effect of that factor seems to be statistically insignificant.

Where I grew up a lot of kids had confederate flags on their trucks, wore confederate flag belt buckles and shirts (including black kids). 

To them it was more about how they viewed the soldiers of the confederacy. ""Rebelling"" in the face of overwhelming odds (the north greatly outnumbered the south) often appeals to cultural groups, and at least where I grew up ""the rednecks"" didn't hate black people and counted them among their friends. 

What I think the poster was getting at is the south is not as segregated as the north, maybe due to the smaller wage gap.

just shared my anecdote to kinda highlight the differences between white people in diverse counties vs white people in majority white, smaller counties. but it is just an anecdote, not law lol."

I suggest you do some research before you say something else stupid

‚ÄúIn the 1920s and 1930s, almost every major cosmologist preferred an eternal steady-state universe, and several complained that the beginning of time implied by the Big Bang imported religious concepts into physics; this objection was later repeated by supporters of the steady-state theory.[53] This perception was enhanced by the fact that the originator of the Big Bang theory, Lema√Ætre, was a Roman Catholic priest.[54] Arthur Eddington agreed with Aristotle that the universe did not have a beginning in time, viz., that matter is eternal. A beginning in time was ""repugnant"" to him.‚Äù"
1197,2020-06-26 13:32:47,hg564a,You attacked people's religion and claimed people commit incest.  That's you being a piece of shit.
1198,2020-06-26 17:06:13,hg564a,Have you been outside your urban bubble? There are probably more confederate symbology in the rural parts of the north than in the actual south.  It has morphed into an anti-urban symbol
1199,2020-06-26 13:42:55,hg564a,Which is why they don‚Äôt have children till their financially stable?? Lemme guess ur gonna say it‚Äôs unfair too have to wait to have children? Cuz that‚Äôs the biggest problem in the black community. Children you can‚Äôt afford
1200,2020-06-26 15:28:30,hg564a,"You could always go the technical/community college route and even transfer to a 4 year school if you maintain good grades.

That's what im doing. I my mother wasn't able to pay a dime towards my college and i've known that since i started high school. I put in the effort and made it out with a 3.7 GPA and I also worked whilst in high school. I was able to get the life scholarship and with the help of financial aid. I decided to go the technical college route without having to pay anything. Plus i got money in my pocket from the school. I wen't to an all black school myself ( I'm black too) and I can honestly say that a lot of the kids there have this mindset that there isn't more to life than the streets. I wish they had the motivation to see past their own neighborhood.

My class only had 105 people and i can guestimate that only 30 of us ""Made it out"". I was able to move out of my mothers and got an appartment with my girlfriend. We both work full time and im in college. I should be finished with my associates in accounting this December.

Im not saying that systematic racism doesn't exist but I feel it's often used as an excuse for some people. All I ever hear people talk about back in highschool was sex, weed, rap artists, and trapping. Whenever someone wounds up pregnant, no one is surprised. So who can we blame for all this?"
1201,2020-06-26 22:00:55,hg564a,In my hillbilly state of TN everyone can go to a community college for free
1202,2020-06-26 23:39:30,hg564a,">Well if your parents don't have money you won't even be able to go to college except if u wanna take in a huge debt

There are ways to do it without debt.  I mean, I'm a working class guy, from a working class family, who got himself through with no debt at all.  


But, you know, keep screeching."
1203,2020-06-26 15:58:20,hg564a,"> Well the civil war was about owning and the right to own slaves. Period. That flag represents to many in the north, the traitors that tried to destroy America to own slaves. 

That's odd, considering there was slavery in the northern states, and the Emancipation Proclamation didn't free them. Glad to know slavery was such a large concern there, though."

1207,2020-06-26 18:21:27,hg564a,"You should know the ""Big Bang"" doesnt argue for where the universe came from, only how it evolved. People who dont understand evolution often make a similar mistake thinking evolution is trying to prove where life came from, but evolution makes no claims towards where life came from. Just like the Big Bang makes no claim about how the universe started. Of course now, it is more commonly referred as Inflation Theory."
1208,2020-06-26 16:08:44,hg564a,i‚Äôm a criminal justice major and i looked at the statistics of sex crimes in the south. we do commit more incest than the rest of the states.
1209,2020-06-26 23:08:12,hg564a,"Lmao your feelings are clearly hurt. The south does lead in incest, though. And folks in the south do believe in angels more than in the north. What is it that you're so upset about? That your cousin won't fuck you in the name of God?"
1210,2020-06-26 13:46:10,hg564a,"Nope. The south leads the country in incest. Alabama takes that award. You can look that up. 

And I said the south has the most adults that believe in angels. Also a fact. 

I know it‚Äôs crazy as a critical thinking adult to believe in a made up angel..  Weird.  

Sorry not sorry that the facts are upsetting you snowflake."

1216,2020-06-26 18:40:48,hg564a,"What mistake did I make in any of my statements? 

You said something that was factually inaccurate thinking you had debunked me when you were unequivocally wrong. 


Lema√Ætre when proposing the primeval atom made no statement about its origins in a divine creator, he proposed a theory that was controversial at the time, yet later widely accepted as a scientific theory. You said that he did not propose the theory."

1219,2020-06-26 18:46:48,hg564a,"Sorry, I may have misspoke (mis-wrote?). Lema√Ætre was Catholic, but saying the church came up with the proposal is silly. In nearly all instances, the church as tried to subjugate science to it's own doctrine."

The Catholic Church has a a complicated relationship with science throughout history, but if you relegate it so one dimensionally with the plan to backpedal when proven wrong, you just look like an idiot"

1223,2020-06-26 19:29:24,hg564a,"If we are working with that logic, then I can say the Catholic Church is an organization for pedophilia. But we both know it is not."
1224,2020-06-26 14:25:41,hg564a,Haha. Sure. Again this is why we need to educate the south!
1225,2020-06-26 19:48:02,hg564a,"I mean yeah you can and people have made that argument, I really find no fault in that statement. At times it‚Äôs been proven to on many instances support institutionally the practice of pedophilia

I‚Äôm not a catholic, don‚Äôt really care about anything but having a conversation grounded in reality. You seem very dedicated to issuing blanket unsupported and factually inaccurate statements, then shifting the topic to try to get away from your bad takes, it‚Äôs fun to watch. Hopefully next time you‚Äôll more thoroughly research a topic before talking about it. You could be surprised to learn how institutional religion has shaped modern science. 

I‚Äôd love to get into abiogenesis with you as well."
1226,2020-06-26 14:52:39,hg564a,"Speaking objectively here...
I think that statement is a little rich coming from someone who will likely throw their vote behind Joe Biden. It seems to me that he‚Äôs not playing with a full deck.

Also, the education that I received in the southern K-12 school that I attended with 800 kids total was quite adequate. A teacher can really focus when your class only has 12 kids in it."
1227,2020-06-26 19:59:47,hg564a,Thank you for the friendly debate. I will look more into how religion has shaped science.
1228,2020-06-26 15:00:09,hg564a,"‚ÄúAdequate‚Äù is a relative term. 
Adequate for the south. Sure. 

Weird most of those small southern classes underperform or can‚Äôt compete compared to the oversized classes in say, Massachusetts. 

I think it‚Äôs the standards that are raised thats why the north outperforms. Or we leave religion out of the education process. That‚Äôs important. 

As far as Trump and Biden. 

Why bother. Trump is the leader of the deplorable. 
Clearly that‚Äôs you."
1229,2020-06-26 23:11:27,hg564a,God damn you sound fucking stupid.

This is a conversation, not an insult contest."
1231,2020-06-26 15:15:12,hg564a,"You make a lot of assumptions.
Adequate was not relative in this instance. I have family scattered all over to compare to. My public education was no different than my cousins from Springfield Mass. Our education was similar in nearly every way. 
In regards to religion... I was never in an environment at my school where religion was a part of my education process. See, you don‚Äôt even know what your talking about. 

You can‚Äôt possibly know my voting trends either.
Deplorable? Hah. The ignorance you‚Äôve shown in this thread is fucking deplorable."
1232,2020-06-26 15:51:28,hg564a,"Not true. The only southern state is Virginia that can compare to Massachusetts in education and is still way below. 
They do keep track of this you know. 

Otherwise it‚Äôs mostly the bottom. 
Of course Alabama, New Mexico, Mississippi and Louisiana fight for that spot yearly. 

Similar maybe. But in results not at all.."

1234,2020-06-26 16:06:41,hg564a,this conversation is so amusing bc you‚Äôre presenting facts and the only thing they can talk about is your attitude. what happened to facts don‚Äôt care about your feelings? what happened to facts/ statistics aren‚Äôt racist?

Also says that he and Taylor picked LWYMMD together as a first single off reputation!

Just more confirmation that Taylor is an absolute professional and joy to work with :)"
1254,2020-06-26 05:31:05,hg0gcj,Honestly her MVs are part of why I became a swiftie. I was a casual fan until I saw the video for blank space and it made me want to know everything she's ever done haha
1255,2020-06-26 05:01:40,hg0gcj,"I hope Taylor decides to work with him again. I know sone fans were tired of his style and directing so many of her videos, but we got so many great visuals: Out of the Woods, for me, is completely stunning."
1256,2020-06-26 09:26:03,hg0gcj,"Well I really hope he works with Taylor for the TS8 videos, just because I feel that the Lover videos have severely been lacking in production value. The most recent videos are just uninteresting and very basic. I miss Joseph's cinematic approach to music videos. Every one of his shots feels intentional and I love that they match the music perfectly."
1257,2020-06-26 06:04:00,hg0gcj,"Wow so it turns out she already had 5 to 6 songs recorded before Feb 2017. 
I'm surprised because i thought most of that time she was in London and started recording songs after Super Bowl."
1258,2020-06-26 13:00:27,hg0gcj,Ooh this is interesting. I wonder what the other 4-5 options for reputation‚Äôs lead single were. I‚Äôd imagine IDSB being there.
1259,2020-06-26 13:45:03,hg0gcj,The videos he made with her are absolutely the best ones in her career. I hope they collaborate again. I wasn't here for MV's in this era.
1260,2020-06-26 14:19:52,hg0gcj,Bring him back! All of the music videos he directed are basically masterpieces. Imagine how amazing Lover era could‚Äôve been if he could‚Äôve directed a video or two üò≠
1261,2020-06-26 11:46:01,hg0gcj,"he is so problematic but let's be honest, Taylor's best videos are directed by him. I mean look at lwymmd, ootw, wildest dreams... I just want him back but Taylor probably doesn't want to work with him again since he can't shut his mouth on twitter"
1262,2020-06-26 06:44:56,hg0gcj,Too bad he's a gross person. I love his videos but I really hope she doesn't work with him again.

Same here. I can't get over how incredibly shot that video is. Literally get chills every time I watch it. I try not to watch it too much, but the attention to detail, the acting, the aesthetic...oh my god. Cannot stop talking about how much I love this video."

1266,2020-06-26 20:01:00,hg0gcj,same! I was so impressed by the videos they made together. Lover eras videos feel like a major let down
1267,2020-06-26 09:20:57,hg0gcj,I love how cinematic his music videos look. They look expensive and are so well thought out. I also really love that every shot matches the music down to the second. It's so effective. That's primarily why Lover videos have been a disappointment for me. The production value just isn't there anymore.
1268,2020-06-26 20:57:06,hg0gcj,"After the video editor (Jordan Orme) watched and commented on Out of the Woods and Look What You Made Me Do, it gave me more appreciation for his direction and vision. The LWYMMD video break down was incredible and watching it through his eyes was amazing.

Sadly, since he's a bit of a toxic person (see below), I don't think she'll work with him again anytime soon."
1269,2020-06-26 14:39:29,hg0gcj,"Me as well, I feel like music videos are honestly one of the most important parts of her eras and I miss the iconic-ness of her videos directed by him."

As far as I am concerned, she and Joseph Kahn are still in good terms"

When there was criticism over Wildest Dreams having ""colonist vibes"" he kinda joked around about it which also wasn't great. There's some more links in this post I found!

1287,2020-06-26 20:00:16,hg0gcj,everybody's problematic nowadays... at least he's talented!
1288,2020-06-26 20:24:26,hg0gcj,"Yes, at least he is not fake like Jack, Shawn and Ed who are artists and songwriter but stay always silent."
1289,2020-06-26 19:07:18,hg0gcj,"(Sigh) That‚Äôs...unfortunate. The whole criticism about Wildest Dreams was definitely valid in my opinion.

Do you think the thing about the lack of black people being historically accurate holds up? It just seems like a bad idea as a powerful white woman to film an entirely-white video in Africa - a place of frequent colonization. Not sure if Taylor herself has brought it up, but it‚Äôd be cool if someone asked her about it or she spoke up."
1290,2020-06-26 20:36:34,hg0gcj,"Ah yes, because being fake is worse than being sexist and racist"
1291,2020-06-27 11:11:49,hg0gcj,"It wasn't entirely white. I think it is historically accurate.

1536,2020-06-30 14:33:41,hikm4n,Got those titties on lockdown
1537,2020-06-30 09:31:25,hiizlk,I was 18 when Glee aired and I can promise you the offensive humor was completely on purpose. It wasn't saying hey this joke is okay. It was being outrageous knowing the audience would go holy shit! If you're the type of person who thinks those jokes are true then you probably don't watch Glee because you're a homophobe. Glee was about the misfits of the world making fun of themselves. The jokes were non politically correct on purpose.
1538,2020-06-30 08:25:34,hiizlk,I wanna see a version of glee when they find out about Mr Schue putting drugs in Finns locker and he gets arrested lmao
1539,2020-06-30 09:17:58,hiizlk,Thats why i love glee. Because it wasnt done today and it really pushed the boundary‚Äôs of society. It was a nice breath of fresh air to get to have such different humour/drama then in other shows.
1540,2020-06-30 10:16:45,hiizlk,"I disagree with most of this because Glee wasn‚Äôt entirely a product of its time. People are a lot more socially aware today, that is true, but we still see racist, homophobic, transphobic and sexist jokes being made on TV today - only this time it usually always comes from ‚Äúbad‚Äù characters or people we know are meant to be ignorant. Which Glee also pretty much did. 

I don‚Äôt understand why Santana would be different, bitchy characters still remain bitchy regardless of when a show is made. 

Eating disorders have always been serious - season 4 aired in 2012 and things regarding that topic were not different from what they are today. Maybe they would‚Äôve attempted to dig deeper into it, but then again, Glee had male writers.

People chase other people in relationships all the time, real and fictional world? I don‚Äôt understand why this would be any different today than it was. Please specify what you mean by ‚Äúit can lead to a lot of problems that didn‚Äôt really happen during the time Glee was made‚Äù? it‚Äôs only 9 years ago. 

Same thing with Marley, ‚Äúboring‚Äù is subjective and has nothing to do with when a character is written. 

Taylor Swift was at her most succesful when Glee was still airing. Most likely, they either didn‚Äôt want to use a bunch of her songs or weren‚Äôt given the rights, and considering Taylor Swift **herself** is fighting for the rights to her own songs, it‚Äôs unlikely Glee would be able to do her songs today. Songs from *Lover*, maybe."
1541,2020-06-30 08:54:19,hiizlk,"honestly i agree, and i think it would‚Äôve been interesting to see some of the charterers take on political conversations and stances since today a lot of high schoolers and young adult (which is the age range of the glee kids are) are talking a lot about political issues and i think it would‚Äôve been interesting seeing a small group (like 3-5 people) take on different view points and stances and see what that leads to along with different view points of teachers and staff who play a major part of how a school is ran.  
like at my school half the shit sue did wouldn‚Äôt have even gotten any good attention and there would‚Äôve been walk outs and protests, same with the way figgins acted."
1542,2020-06-30 09:45:30,hiizlk,"I could see Mr.Schue dodging bullets but eventually land in jail and from.his cell, he sees one of the competitions on the tv on the wall and nods in acceptance. Until one of the other inmates yells, ""turn that ish off!"" But the next episode he hears one of the inmates singing in the shower and approaches them and eventually forms a jail glee club...The Jail Birds maybe?"
1543,2020-06-30 11:17:29,hiizlk,"The thing is on the first season de could clearly see how satirical the show was. It was a parody with all types ot clich√©s jokes to denounce Real issues. That's why Glee was so successful. However as the season went on, they lost that flair and the jokes were not that good and we could see that Ryan Murphy was kinda bored with the show."
1544,2020-06-30 08:16:39,hiizlk,"Let‚Äôs be honest, they wouldn‚Äôt even get through a single season before getting cancelled if glee was remade"
1545,2020-07-01 00:33:33,hiizlk,if the show went like the above in your post they're wouldnt be a show at all..
1546,2020-06-30 22:26:42,hiizlk,"I mean regardless of whether it was purposeful or not, it wouldn't really fly in 2020"
1547,2020-06-30 10:07:26,hiizlk,"he never planted it in his locker, he just pretended he did to scare Finn. so he wouldn‚Äôt get arrested."
1548,2020-06-30 10:47:19,hiizlk,Taylor swift was definitely not on her most successful when glee was airing
1549,2020-06-30 16:22:56,hiizlk,"you can disagree that fine irdc. i fully understand the jokes that they made that did seem offensive were for the purpose of humor. i really just don‚Äôt not think they‚Äôd work today

santana in some episode kinda came off to me as a bullying and i think they would‚Äôve done more with that whole bully thing. she was never called a bully even tho sometimes she acted like it and i think if people saw her as one her whole dynamic would changed

in the world of social media you see girls with flat stomach and guys with abs... it‚Äôs easy to see how NOW MORE THEN EVER teens see this kinda stuff and become tempted because they just want to be their ‚Äúskinniest‚Äù self. eating disorder have always been serious that is true but they weren‚Äôt taken seriously. did you see kitty get into any really trouble? no. because it wasn‚Äôt taken seriously on the show but irl eating disorders can be found everywhere and in some cases cause more mental health disorders 

what mr schue did was not being able to let go to emma even tho she pointed all signs in his direction that he should. he could‚Äôve become depressed thinking he couldn‚Äôt live without her. i mean this happens today. he could‚Äôve become obsessed with her like really and done anything to get her back. i couldn‚Äôt see this happening but it does happen irl. 

marley is boring and all i‚Äôm gonna say is that people don‚Äôt tend to like characters without personality and a strong story line which she had neither (just an opinion) LIKE I ALREADY SAID

taylor swift was absolutely not at her most success. she now can sell out stadiums and back when glee was airing. no. i can see the whole ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt get the rights‚Äù but they did do 2 of her songs back then. and maybe your right and they just didn‚Äôt want to use them but if they made glee today i can‚Äôt see how they wouldnt do them she is one of the best selling artist in the world and a lot of her songs can relate to real things going on

just saying"
1550,2020-06-30 10:30:56,hiizlk,Jail directions
1551,2020-06-30 08:17:20,hiizlk,that accuracy tho
1552,2020-07-01 00:41:49,hiizlk,i meant it hypothetically they would never make a show like what i described lol
1553,2020-06-30 10:29:54,hiizlk,I mean he still purchased drugs and blackmailed a student üíÄ
1554,2020-06-30 12:43:13,hiizlk,"Fearless: Released in 2008, best-selling album in 2009, Album of The Year at the Grammy‚Äôs in 2010.

Speak Now: Released in 2010, over 1 million copies sold *the first week* (only her, Ed Sheeran and Adele could accomplish this in the whole decade), a **world** tour that grossed $123 million.

Red: Released in 2012, 1.2 million copies sold first week, the Red tour grossed $150 million. This is her 3rd number one album so far, and we‚Äôre only at season 4 of Glee at this point.

1989: Released in 2014, 1.287 million copies sold first week, Album of the Year at the Grammy‚Äôs, 10 million copies sold worldwide, #1 album in several countries. Still at season 5 of Glee.

This is also around the time she was the most followed person on Instagram (maybe second to Selena Gomez). Are you still questioning this?"
1555,2020-06-30 12:31:41,hiizlk,"He got the drugs for free and was nearly forced into accepting it, but yes, he did blackmail a student into joining a club which Finn could quit anytime he wanted. barely qualifies for jail."
1556,2020-06-30 18:50:43,hiizlk,oh hey fellow swiftie!!! I'd say Speak Now is one of her best albums but I've also always wondered why they did nothing from the unquestionable masterpiece that's RED...
1557,2020-06-30 16:03:02,hiizlk,"she won artist of the decade not too long ago and she has really grown in popularity all that stuff about sales didn‚Äôt mean much because compared to the fan base she does have now it has grown insanely and i‚Äôm not completely sure her songs that were in red, speak now, and fearless would‚Äôve really worked in glee anyway but her newer album fs could‚Äôve"

1608,2020-08-20 14:04:44,id9j7g,"That article is from a satire website so its point isn‚Äôt meant to be taken seriously. 

That being said, I don‚Äôt think artists should be blamed for their underserving wins. After all, they didn‚Äôt award themselves, that awards body did. It‚Äôs unproductive because it isn‚Äôt focused on the real problem, which in this case is the Recording Academy‚Äôs clear unwillingness to reward black artists and their music (outside of ‚ÄòUrban‚Äô categories). 

No black artist has won AOTY since 2008. In the past decade, where incredibly acclaimed and impactful works like *channel ORANGE,* *To Pimp A Butterfly,* and *Lemonade* have been up for the top prize, all have lost to ‚Äúsafer‚Äù and oftentimes less deserving works by non-black musicians. And in the case of *1989* and *25*, they‚Äôd rather give a white artist AOTY for a second time than recognize groundbreaking black art from creative who have yet to win. You can even have the most acclaimed AND commercially successful album in contention (as was the case for Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs *DAMN.,* which achieved a 95 on metacritic, an eventual Pulitzer, and was #1 on Billboard‚Äôs Year End Chart with multiple hit singles) and STILL lose, which shows their ridiculously highs standards for black artists. 

*1989* is one of my favorite albums, but in no way would I call it a more impressive body of work than *TPAB* (which should‚Äôve easily won). I also think *25* is great and deserving of many of its other wins that night, but it‚Äôs insane that Beyonc√©‚Äôs constant reinvention and innovation hasn‚Äôt yielded an AOTY win (and Adele would tell you herself that *Lemonade* should‚Äôve won; she already did in her acceptance speech). However, systemic issues in the Recording Academy and their voter base are to blame, not the artists who won."

1626,2020-08-20 14:17:44,id675u,"This is one where I base off both looks and what I know about them.  Taylor tries to pass herself off as some kind of innocent ""good girl"" but really sleeps around with every other guy in Hollywood.  That's a major turn-off for me, plus I just think Melissa is more attractive in general.  I figure I could get it off my chest here and not be downvoted nearly as much as I would in other sub-reddits LOL!"
1627,2020-08-20 18:10:46,id675u,It just seems like Taylor‚Äôs been passed around by a lot of guys would passed around a lot of women!
1628,2020-08-20 11:48:29,id675u,"Don't have a dog in this fight, but Taylor is wearing the HELL out of that dress. Melissa looks kind of plain here, tbh."
1629,2020-08-20 16:21:13,id675u,"Probably not the best picture of Melissa to go up against Taylor with. However, Melissa really grew on me as I started watching the first few seasons of Supergirl. I'm voting for her here.

Taylor is very pretty, but I've never really been drawn to her. Probably just not my type, but I can see how other people would be."

1660,2020-08-20 02:11:16,id15s2,"I feel that Jordan Howard is also in this camp, he‚Äôs going late as well and he‚Äôs definitely gonna start the season as the Dolphins starter."
1661,2020-08-20 01:50:30,id15s2,"Mack sure, love his game. Gladly welcome him on my team for $2 or $3.

Kerryon, not so sure. He might actually be decent though while he lasts, i've just never loved his game. he put up a few decent games the past 2 years but he will get hurt and swift will start a game or 2"
1662,2020-08-20 01:46:03,id15s2,GREAT VALUE! I love it.
1663,2020-08-20 01:58:34,id15s2,"Mack is still going to get a ton of carries.  He‚Äôs a really good running back, they aren‚Äôt going to just bench him.  I could see Mack getting the bulk of the carries early and then maybe closer to 50/50 by the end of the year.  Kerryon is trash."
1664,2020-08-20 01:47:58,id15s2,I'll take either or both in later rounds once I secure my starters. Certainly talented RBs with extra value if an injury takes down the rookies. Kinda nice to not have such a drought at RB for depth this year.
1665,2020-08-20 01:41:52,id15s2,I think Kerryon is going to be a 3rd down back if he plays at all. Guy is made of glass.
1666,2020-08-20 02:16:18,id15s2,My opinion is that Mack is definitely worth the value but to stay clear of Kerryon. Swift is the better pass catching back as he‚Äôs excelled in that area in college and I think the better all around back in general. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he takes over early down roles towards beginning of the season too.
1667,2020-08-20 01:53:58,id15s2,"Kerryon isn‚Äôt even practicing, Swift has a real chance to take the 3 down workload on offer and run away with it.

Mack? Sure. He might get passed on the depth chart eventually, but right now it‚Äôs his job to lose. And he isn‚Äôt some scrub either."
1668,2020-08-20 01:50:18,id15s2,I think Tevin Coleman is in the same boat as these guys.  Guys we think will get passed on depth chart but may hold on to their lead role  at lest for some time.   Going by the offensive lines they are behind I‚Äôd take Mack then Coleman and kerryon last of the 3.  Just don‚Äôt think I want a Det lions RB no mater who is the rb1.
1669,2020-08-20 02:02:46,id15s2,Me
1670,2020-08-20 10:59:17,id15s2,I'm just hoping Mack goes off the first game or two and I can flip him.
1671,2020-08-20 13:25:58,id15s2,"Kerryon is apparently still dealing with last season‚Äôs injury. In general, he doesn‚Äôt seem like a big upside producer and it‚Äôs the Lions, who seem to be a Death Valley of sorts for RB‚Äôs. Mack seems to be at a decent ADP value right now but it‚Äôs likely just a matter of time before Taylor starts cutting more into his carries....could be sooner, could be later."
1672,2020-08-20 14:15:43,id15s2,Theo Riddick and Reggie Bush were pretty solid RB2s in ppr. I don‚Äôt think Kerryon has their skillset though.
1673,2020-08-20 12:48:30,id15s2,Over Matt Breida?
1674,2020-08-20 02:41:25,id15s2,"Kerryon is wearing a knee brace, so he may not even be entering 2020 at 100%."
1675,2020-08-20 13:30:54,id15s2,If you draft Taylor at 3-4...better grab Mack later
1676,2020-08-20 01:43:16,id15s2,Is that a bad thing though? 3rd down backs might even be more valuable in ppr formats.
1677,2020-08-20 02:03:56,id15s2,Is Kerryon hurt already? I must‚Äôve missed why he isn‚Äôt practicing.
1678,2020-08-20 01:54:56,id15s2,I think Mostert has already left Tevin in his dust.
1679,2020-08-20 12:52:44,id15s2,"Matt Breida can‚Äôt handle a lot of touches, Howard can. Also the Dolphins run game is not the 49ers run game, Breida won‚Äôt be able to produce just by being fast anymore."
1680,2020-08-20 13:07:02,id15s2,"Breida is made of glass, he's a big play machine but can't handle a big workload."
1681,2020-08-20 01:44:59,id15s2,I think that's best case scenario. He's been hurt every year going back to high school I think. He just played through injuries at Auburn.
1682,2020-08-20 01:55:46,id15s2,The Lions haven't been successful at running the ball in basically 30 years. I don't want the passing down back
1683,2020-08-20 01:46:02,id15s2,"I would prefer they play on all three downs, so yeah that‚Äôs probably bad"
1684,2020-08-20 02:06:10,id15s2,Kerryon was last seen in a knee brace.
1685,2020-08-20 02:10:56,id15s2,Not to mention any time Coleman has a change to be a starter he ends up being mediocre and wasting the chance.
1686,2020-08-20 11:00:32,id15s2,The way Shanahan plays his RBs there will be weeks where Coleman gets the most touches and I‚Äôm still not convinced Mostert won‚Äôt flame out.
1687,2020-08-20 17:25:42,id15s2,Yea I agree. What do you suppose is Miami‚Äôs plan adding both of these guys?
1688,2020-08-20 01:49:27,id15s2,"Cool, good luck finding those guys past round 2. That‚Äôs not the point of my post."

1690,2020-08-20 11:02:28,id15s2,Hard to see a guy flaming out with a massive 254 career touches. He's more likely to double that this season than flame out IMO. We've seen enough of Tevin to know he's mediocre when he's thrust into a lead back role.

A target is worth more than a carry."
1695,2020-08-20 17:48:37,id15s2,"They definitely have been, but I have a gut feeling the Miami offense will be pretty good this year. Parker/Gesicki/Williams will surprise folks in the passing game."

1701,2020-08-20 02:11:13,iczvc4,"Answer: Taylor Swift has historically been fairly apolitical, but in recent months has come out as vocally anti-Trump and anti-GOP. Swift has about 87 MILLION followers on Twitter, and while she hasn't been very political in the past, there's been some evidence that when she DOES speak up about politics, it actually leads to things happening, particularly motivating young fans to register and vote.

This past week she opened back up about politics again, slamming the Trump administration's handling of the USPS. 

In the days following her condemnation of Trump, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian both made passive-aggressive tweets alluding the Swift, [specifically referencing back to calling her a snake.](https://pagesix.com/2020/08/15/kanye-west-conjures-up-past-taylor-swift-feud-with-snake-tweet/) Swift's fans are now swarming West in retaliation."
1702,2020-08-20 04:54:28,iczvc4,That makes alot more sense now. Thanks for the answer!
1703,2020-08-20 09:17:19,iczvc4,"There's more context. Swift and Kimye had maintained a relatively friendly relationship in public until 2016, when they got involved in a feud. Kanye released a song with some unflattering lyrics aimed at Swift, and he said Swift had given her approval. Swift said she had not. Kim then released an edited video of a phone conversation between Kanye and Swift which apparently showed Swift approving, and called her a snake. Swift took a lot of criticism and retreated from the public for a while.

Earlier this year, a much longer video surfaced of the phone call, which showed that Swift was right. Kanye had not told Swift of the song's lyrics in its entirety, Swift did not approve the lyrics, and Kim selectively published certain parts of the video. So, some of Swift's fan took this to mean Kimye had framed Swift, and are taking revenge.

1713,2020-08-19 22:00:52,icxdx2,"It's a difficult exercise due to landing spot. Look at CEH and Swift for example. Talent wise, not sure anyone would pick CEH over Swift (as pre-draft metrics and consensus points to). For example, I would say Swift's landing spot is neutral. 

Would a neutral landing spot for Etienne be significantly higher than Swift right now? Should Chase be above Reagor who went to a near ideal spot?

I give you credit for trying but its a headache trying to work through it all lol."
1714,2020-08-20 08:57:26,icxdx2,This list is missing Akers. He'd be right around the Swift area for me.
1715,2020-08-20 01:06:33,icxdx2,"Lawrence, Fields, Burrow would be 1.01-1.03. 
Fields is a superior prospect. 

ETN is RB1. Very troubling to hear his weight is way down. I would take Chase 1.05. If we we were doing prospect, I would take Jeudy next. 

You can choose between JT and CEH for 1.06-1.07. 

I think the next two off the board are Lamb and Terry. Terry is my WR2 next year. I think when it comes down to it, he's going to run a silly 40 having put on weight and Bateman is going to need to cut down significantly just to put a number up that's acceptable enough to give NFL evaluators comfort that he can separate. 

I would likely have Journey and Chuba next. Then hit Gainwell, Dobbins, Lance, Swift, Bateman, Akers. Gainwell needs to be on 15 lbs and he's your next RB stud. 

I personally cannot take Tua. I just don't trust his injuries and Herbert wasn't on my draft board. 

I would maybe take Waddle, Najee, Jefferson Ruggs over Moore then Reagor. Now seems crazy because Moore is also another name you see as WR2, but Moore is tiny. He's not DJax playing the outside, he's going to get Austin Collie'd. 

I think Smith outplayed Ruggs last year on tape but his age is a no for me. I would then probably have Pitts, Williams and St Brown over Smith."

1718,2020-08-20 01:12:06,icxdx2,Are these rankings as prospects or baking in landing spots?
1719,2020-08-20 03:44:27,icxdx2,"You‚Äôre way too low on Moore, yes he‚Äôs small (short) but he‚Äôs a thick guy, his BMI will be fine. His size and athletic comp is Tyreek hill who hasn‚Äôt had major injury concerns. Moore is also incredibly dynamic and has a breakout age that will be in at least the 95th percentile with an impressive dominator rating"
1720,2020-08-19 23:15:35,icxdx2,"Eh I guess, I get the drill. There is just so much variance between comparing players who have known spots vs non. We are comparing apples to oranges. 

I think the excersise is more useful if we look at them all in the same vein, and we can only do that as prospects.

I also think it‚Äôs more useful in understanding how the classes stack up, but to each their own."
1721,2020-08-20 01:53:38,icxdx2,"I tried to stay away and do prospects but it's tough because you have known information so it's a little of both (in cases like CEH) it's undeniable that he's not a top 10 prospect. I just sort of treated all 2021 as neutral. I did bake in Jeudy as more of a prospect. I am not the biggest fan of Lock but I don't mind his landing spot behind a legit WR1 because it's favourable matchups that he can exploit. 

I am high on Jeudy. I still would consider him strongly at 1.03 this year. I would have taken him at 1.04 if I was able to make a deal for him in my $$ league. I understand that he has fallen behind Lamb in a majority of rankings and that's okay. I think they are similarity ranked."
1722,2020-08-19 23:19:04,icxdx2,"Yeah, if your goal is to just rank them for a theoretical discussion, sure, but I‚Äôm imagining a dynasty forum cares more about the application of upcoming auctions/drafts! Lol"

How would ranking them in a prospect hierarchy not speak to that? There‚Äôs more than one way to do this.

1727,2020-09-07 17:08:24,io8qrl,I'd add Joshua Kelley as a slight riser too I think. He's looked great in camp and with the unfortunate Jackson injury he could very well see meaningful playing time early.
1728,2020-09-07 18:31:17,io8qrl,Zack Moss is up for sure since the draft
1729,2020-09-07 20:37:52,io8qrl,I think you're way off on Jalen reagor. Everything I've read and everything I've heard from local reporters covering the Eagles is that reagor has been absolutely as advertised in camp pre-injury.
1730,2020-09-07 15:47:30,io8qrl,Besides injury to Kupp or Woods is there any chance we see Van Jefferson take over as the WR2 anytime soon?  Do with of them have contracts due in the future that could send them away?
1731,2020-09-07 14:56:29,io8qrl,"Justin Jefferson is down, they are openly talking about Bisi as the WR2.

Mims is down, there is no world in which you just excuse his camp as not being bad because of injury.

Aiyuk is up (before injury, see how that works?) and is still up, but less so.

Mcfarland is Way down, Pitt has talked about using 1 or 2 RB's, not a committee, and they have said Snell is their 2 and looks great.

Gabe Davis is up

Deejay Dallas is up too"

1733,2020-09-07 18:09:36,io8qrl,"Nice write-up. I think Gibson could not have had a more perfect off-season. If I weren't a truther and had just drafted Gibson because he was next up on the board, I probably would be cashing out for a 1st but I'm very excited to see where this hype train goes.

I'm glad to see Van getting the hype he is, but I do think getting snaps over Kupp and Woods is gonna be a brick wall for this season. Could be a blow-up player if Kupp's injury gets worse though."
1734,2020-09-07 18:22:27,io8qrl,I‚Äôd put Pittman slightly down because of reports about drops and both Lamb and Jeudy (particularly Jeudy) slightly up because after their glowing camp reports they seem to be even safer picks now.
1735,2020-09-07 20:58:47,io8qrl,"Where do you get the idea that backfield competition is strong with the Rams and Akers? He‚Äôs pretty much received 1st team reps since day 1. Henderson has been out almost 2 weeks with a hamstring injury, so it‚Äôs only been Akers and Brown. The team isn‚Äôt going to come right out and say Akers is the lead guy because it‚Äôs disrespectful to the vets. This is the same thing that was going on with CEH before Williams opted out. I wouldn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs fallen at all even slightly. Was going as the last big RB off the board and seems to have actually moved up in my eyes over Swift."
1736,2020-09-07 17:39:03,io8qrl,What are your thoughts on Darryton Evans? Looks like the titans plan to run Henry into the ground this season leaving Evans as the probable successor.
1737,2020-09-07 17:07:22,io8qrl,"I'm surprised Moss isn't on the risers list.  Perhaps the OP hasn't been swayed by the reports of Moss looking like a 50/50 split (I'm skeptical too) but for his ADP I would think people are taking him in the early second now at the least.  I've seen a couple where he goes end of the 1st too.

Also I agree on the Gibson rise but I'm not on the hype train quite yet.  I just don't buy it that he'll be more than a COP-style back in the long run."
1738,2020-09-07 17:08:42,io8qrl,Where's the competition with Akers? Henderson isn't even going to play week 1 and McVay specifically named him and Van Jefferson as rookies that stood out during camp.

1744,2020-09-07 19:51:50,io8qrl,"I actually have Akers up since the draft. Henderson missed most the live portion of camp and may not even be ready for week one. You can see the increased 2020 expectations in his redraft ADP, which has been steadily improving since early August."

1746,2020-09-07 20:45:45,io8qrl,Swift fell to 2.5 in my draft last night after the AP news dropped. I'd say his stock fell A LOT.  I was hoping to get Zach Moss or AJ Dillion there. But instead Swift was there. I was happy.
1747,2020-09-07 21:44:28,io8qrl,Ceedee Lamb isn‚Äôt the 1A. He has Cooper and Gallup ahead of him at the moment. I own him in my dynasty and I‚Äôm quite happy about it. I think he emerges in a good offence before too long.
1748,2020-09-07 22:24:48,io8qrl,"You lost me with a few of these. According to a lot of camp reports Edward's looks like the guy, not ruggs. That's pretty far from a stock up scenario for a 1st round wr.

As for the taylor stuff, I think that's all talk. Mack is done. Taylor is better by every measure.

For CEH, I don't think damien William's was really the issue. I don't think many people think DWill is a hall of fame level player. But there are some legitimate reasons for concern with CEHs profile. And the top back in andy Reids system hasn't always been saquon level. Personally, I like CEH but I see 0 chance that we're ever talking about him as a saquon level talent or that he has that value in dynasty. He should have a good season, but andy reid also likes to have talented backups who get touches. If DWill is gone they definitely add someone next year. The only guy int this class that I think could become a saquon/zeke type player is JT."

1751,2020-09-07 23:23:32,io8qrl,What about Pittman?
1752,2020-09-07 23:45:04,io8qrl,"JT will be used like AP in his rookie year (2007). Chester Taylor was the ""starter"" that season, but AP was dynamite in limited touches. He hung like 220/2 on the bears with like 15 touches mid season. I expect the same. He'll be a RB1 (top12) by EOS, and that's conservative"
1753,2020-09-08 00:14:25,io8qrl,"Moss should be rising, probably be that pass catching back at least and if Singletary continues his fumbling could be the lead back quickly."
1754,2020-09-08 00:25:28,io8qrl,Got burrow and dobbins in the first then gibson and edwards in the third. Loving the outlook so far.
1755,2020-09-08 00:31:29,io8qrl,Moss and Viska are definitely arrows up.   I‚Äòd take them at the end of the 1st over Mims and Jefferson who I see as a slight faller due to the very concerning fact he couldnt beat out Bisi for gosh sakes.
1756,2020-09-08 00:40:29,io8qrl,I wish more people posted this quality of content. Very well written. Clear succinct. Well organized. Take my upvote!
1757,2020-09-08 00:49:33,io8qrl,Gibson had 77 total touches from scrimmage for his entire collegiate career and people think he‚Äôs going to be a bell cow. Yeah ok...
1758,2020-09-08 01:09:13,io8qrl,"Lol at Swift and Taylor

Please be in my league and take Akers over these studs

The write up is solid but I can't agree with that in the slightest"
1759,2020-09-08 02:16:37,io8qrl,"Nice write-up! I also think Xavier Jones gets a bump-up for making the roster (lol). Cephus has had a good camp too.

&#x200B;

Really happy that I drafted Clyde, Edwards, and Gibson :)"
1760,2020-09-08 15:13:41,io8qrl,"Lots of good thinking here!  Doing the legwork and having a plan is the best way to prevent later regrets.  Injury and bad luck can strike any player or team but it doesn't sting like a poor decision - more on this from a personal perspective later.

But I'm sure you're looking for some critical perspective so I'll try to provide some.  I was struck by the emphasis on the 2020 season which I think could use some recalibration.  I hope you don't have expectations to win the 'ship with a bunch of rookie picks.  You can and should work towards that, and your rooks can make a difference, but by themselves it's unlikely to happen.

So with that in mind I would upgrade Taylor, Dobbins, Tua and Swift, and downgrade Ruggs and Edwards.  For the latter pair, keep in mind that they are on a very bad offense that was especially poor at WR last year.  Of course the team sees an upgrade. 

The first four will see an explosive rise in value.  Dobbins and Taylor could be solid contributors, even league winners in the last third of this year.  Tua and Swift are more likely to be fully online in 2021.

Raegor is going to be just fine.  I am reminded of OBJ's situation in his rookie year when I passed over him and chose Bishop Sankey instead.  (sings) Regrets, I've had a few.

Lastly there are the guys you should consider trading if the offer is right.  I'd move Gibson in a heartbeat for a proven young player with some bad press, someone like Courtland Sutton or for one or more players with upside such as Hockensen, Fant, Mattison or Slayton.  I would not trade for a pick - why roll the dice again when you've already won?"
1761,2020-09-07 15:08:45,io8qrl,Thanks! Any major agreements/disagreements?
1762,2020-09-07 19:14:51,io8qrl,"I'd take him over Vaughn at this point. More direct path to relevance combined with more optimistic camp reports, not to mention that I thought his draft capital was more in line with what it should have been anyway. Vaughn was always a reach"
1763,2020-09-07 17:43:30,io8qrl,Absolutely. He's definitely a must-draft-mid 3rd or earlier now. Probably early 3rd.
1764,2020-09-07 20:31:52,io8qrl,You‚Äôre not alone in that thought. I can dig a small but definite uptick for him
1765,2020-09-07 20:46:27,io8qrl,"Oh! I've not heard anything bad about Reagor's SKILLS - let me just stress that a lot of his upside that was baked into him sort of being consensus WR#3 was that he would dominate the WR room immediately. I think the injury at least rains a LITTLE on that parade. Even if it just knocks him down a spot, that's significant when we're talking first round. I'm out on him at 1.08 now, but I'm still way in if he were to drop to 1.10."
1766,2020-09-07 15:58:14,io8qrl,I think Van could conceivably immediately be WR3. That‚Äôs not actually a great role on a team that should probably use 2 TE sets regularly. But I think he will push for WR2 work as well.
1767,2020-09-07 16:27:12,io8qrl,Kupp‚Äôs is up after this season.
1768,2020-09-07 18:53:00,io8qrl,"One of the important things to remember about McVay is that he largely funnels targets through 3-4 players. It is pretty consistent across his time as OC in Washington and for LAR. For the past few years you essentially had the 3 WRs and gurley getting 80-120 targets apiece, and about 100 targets leftover for other players. The WR3 on that offense potentially is getting the volume to be a low WR1/high WR2. Even without kupp or woods getting moved. 

I don't really buy into lots of 12 personnel sets unless the oline struggles again. If it struggles again, the WR3 is going to lose volume to the TEs..but otherwise I expect the WR3 to be fantasy viable."
1769,2020-09-07 15:08:27,io8qrl,"Fair takes - I also chalk part of Mim's down camp to the fact that Gase is there, and already baked that into my valuation of him previously, so it might mean I see him as down less in magnitude because I already thought he might take longer to develop because his coach is a moron.   


I think you make a fair case for Jefferson to be down slightly. I'm on board with that.   


No arguments w/ Gabe Davis, Deejay Dallas - they're guys that absolutely should be in the 3rd of Rookie drafts happening now. I'd include Cephus in that list as well - lots of rave reviews from camp."
1770,2020-09-07 19:28:25,io8qrl,Agree with all of these
1771,2020-09-07 22:11:18,io8qrl,Bisi confirmed as WR2 on the depth chart
1772,2020-09-07 18:05:17,io8qrl,"Definitely bolstered by a solid camp and an injury above him on the depth chart. One of the deeper sleepers, but maybe Terry‚Äôs success last year should teach us not to undervalue Ohio State WRs."
1773,2020-09-07 21:14:29,io8qrl,would you rather have him or joe reed?
1774,2020-09-07 18:29:15,io8qrl,Yeah. I grabbed Gibson at 3.01/25 in our 12 team league and was THRILLED to get him as a lottery ticket. Then all the dominoes started to fall...
1775,2020-09-07 18:26:50,io8qrl,Absolutely - you could mark Pittman as sightly more likely to bust and Jeudy/Lamb as sightly less likely. Good take!
1776,2020-09-07 21:04:47,io8qrl,"I've got Akers as 4A to Swift's 4B now. I think the difference is that Swift actually had better camp news than practically any of non-CEH top 5 guys until he got hurt - was looking like he would be a day 1 starter, while none of the rest of the guys had earned that. 

I think that's important to note because I feel like Akers had the weakest backfield competition of the top 5 backs (other than CEH) - so I actually felt going in like he was going to come in full Alpha and show that the FSU-is-terrible-narrative was correct and therefore start the season as the clear 1 - so for me, I had him a **very slight** down tick because some of my higher-end optimism is shaved off here. 

But all that word salad to say, he's 1 spot higher on my draft board than he was in June because of Swift's injury+AP."
1777,2020-09-07 17:41:18,io8qrl,"I think Evans stock took a SMALL hit due to the Henry contract. He's a wide range of outcomes guy as well because we don't know how he'll fair against equal competition. At his likely late 2nd round price I still think he could be something. He'd be squarely behind the top 6 RB (counting GibSZN as 6 now) as well as behind Moss and Dillon. I think RB9 is a fair spot for him, in the conversation with Kelley. I like Evans more than Vaughn at this point, definitely."
1778,2020-09-07 23:26:40,io8qrl,Also read evans was having some fumbling issues
1779,2020-09-07 17:46:01,io8qrl,"I think Moss can make a case for a slight uptick. I've read those 50/50 talks and I can definitely see it. I offered the Guice owner Gibson for Moss straight up right after the Guice news. We ended up not making a deal because he wanted slightly more than Gibson straight up. I really like Moss but I feel that at least on the short term, I dodged a bullet there.   


Moss is a break-tackle beast. His upside is capped because his competition is both young and competent. He's absolutely undoubtedly risen due to other fallers, though. I'd take him in front of Mims and Vaughn, two guys that were probably ahead of him on most charts in June."
1780,2020-09-07 21:07:15,io8qrl,"Henderson is expected to play week 1
Also - Those are the rams top two draft picks. It‚Äôs not like he called them out of a list of guys - he basically said all our rookies have been good. There‚Äôs been much more positive news around Jefferson than Akers"
1781,2020-09-07 17:43:01,io8qrl,"Really just a slight knock that Akers could've really elevated himself by beating out wimpy competition to be a week 1 starter. We all know that was less likely due to Covid camps, but I would've liked to see that - as it is, Swift's downward trend has me bumping Akers to RB4A over him now, so that's still a slight uptick. :)"
1782,2020-09-07 19:54:41,io8qrl,"Rookie value doesn't really fall in the first year IMO, most people are willing to pay for the talent till around week 15ish."
1783,2020-09-07 18:04:01,io8qrl,"Right on! Just because some players are ‚Äútop fallers‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really mean they‚Äôve fallen in the same magnitude as some of the risers. Far from it, save for Vaughn (RIP)"
1784,2020-09-07 20:31:26,io8qrl,Nice! What pick #s were they?
1785,2020-09-07 23:25:35,io8qrl,"I got CEH(1), Edwards(20), Van(23), Gibson(24), and Kelly(28). I am so floored. I hope this hype pays out on a couple of them.  Would really help my team."
1786,2020-09-07 20:31:02,io8qrl,Sort of a break even for me - probably a slight uptick honestly. But only slight. He will at least be given every opportunity to fill a hole in the talent vacuum that is Miami RB/WR positions (probably WR first!)
1787,2020-09-07 15:59:06,io8qrl,It‚Äôs very possible. Torn labrums are not fun though. His rookie campaign could involve playing through significant discomfort.
1788,2020-09-07 17:41:48,io8qrl,"Thanks! This is my first year rebuilding, so every camp story has me doing cartwheels or pulling out my hair. :)"
1789,2020-09-07 20:48:47,io8qrl,"Fair - I think he's roughly in a similar spot that he was in before though which is why I say he's fairly even - if people were debating between him and Dillon, they've broken for Moss. But Gibson and Edwards have leapfrogged him on a lot of boards too - so in the case of Moss, he's held his ground despite a few major hype trains passing him. Absolutely on board with calling Gibson the clear 6 and Moss the clear 7 at this point.   


I'd say he should never slip beyond 2.06-2.07 in 1QB."
1790,2020-09-07 20:52:34,io8qrl,That's absolute insane drop off. Swift is still **at worst** RB5 and pick 1.07 in 1QB - if you feel that the reduced year 1 production drops him below the two alpha-WRs. That's a GREAT grab for you. Who else did you get?
1791,2020-09-07 21:50:31,io8qrl,"\*\*Rookie 1A/B compared to Jeudy as the counter.   
Absolutely agree that he'll take a second fiddle position for a bit."
1792,2020-09-07 23:01:03,io8qrl,"I would say Edwards doesn't look like the guy \*\*over\*\* Ruggs, he's just drawing the major hype. I would still say smart money is on Ruggs as the 1st overall WR taken, who was falling to the 2nd round in 1QB leagues, and really shouldn't.

That said - it's undeniable that Edwards has the biggest stock gain of any WR. Easily.

Regarding JT - I am absolutely hoping it's all talk. Mack is no slouch though. I took Taylor at 1.01 - the sort of camp I was hoping for to say I struck gold was one where the coaches said ""sheesh, we're just going to have to start him right away"". That didn't happen, and a little bit of a counter narrative happened. As a result, Taylor is a lock for 1.02 on my Rookie board if the draft was today versus back in June. I do 100% agree with your take on JT being the only guy that seems like he could class with Saquon/Zeke.

I think Gibson is similarly in his physical GIFTS as JT, but a guy turning into a Saquon/Zeke talent at this point would be a shocker.  I think Gibson's ""jackpot upside"" is turning into a regular RB10-14 range. JT's is RB1."
1793,2020-09-07 22:56:17,io8qrl,Thanks bro!
1794,2020-09-07 23:24:47,io8qrl,"I can get on board with that! I feel like his stock is still in that ‚Äútop 3 range in 12 Team SF‚Äù but I will 100% agree it hasn‚Äôt slipped at all, and totally defer to people who have more experience in 12 Team SF leagues."
1795,2020-09-07 23:30:04,io8qrl,"Pittman has a few competent roadblocks in front of him and nothing from camp suggests he‚Äôs put them in the rear view yet, which is disappointing. On a run-first team that is talking about a 1-1 punch, I am a bit worried about opportunity at this point."
1796,2020-09-07 23:43:41,io8qrl,However - don‚Äôt despair. It‚Äôs wayyyyy too early to really know if a WR is ‚Äúlooking like a miss‚Äù.
1797,2020-09-07 23:48:19,io8qrl,Make it so!
1798,2020-09-08 00:21:02,io8qrl,The fumbles are a huge wildcard that could boost Moss into a 60/40. Absolutely!
1799,2020-09-08 00:41:00,io8qrl,Those 3rd rounders are especially looking pretty gold right now!!
1800,2020-09-08 00:42:24,io8qrl,I‚Äôm definitely in on Moss and Viska over Mims right now. I would probably not drop any top 5 WR too too far based on a brief Covid camp though.
1801,2020-09-08 00:42:59,io8qrl,Thanks! Maybe I‚Äôll try to do a weekly update on the state of the rookies. :-)
1802,2020-09-08 01:22:31,io8qrl,He‚Äôs the definition of a wide range of outcomes. No one buys a lottery ticket expecting to win. His physical gifts make it possible. His sample size makes it unlikely.
1803,2020-09-08 01:11:24,io8qrl,"Taylor is still 1.02 for me. He‚Äôs a faller for me because he was co 1.01 previously.

Swift went from 1.04 to 1.05 for me, but he‚Äôs really just 1.04B. I just really have no trust in Patricia. If he gets fired, back to 1.04!"
1804,2020-09-08 02:32:10,io8qrl,Cephus is a major dark horse for me. If I had picks after the 3rd round this year he would‚Äôve been a target for me.
1805,2020-09-07 16:06:50,io8qrl,"I may be wrong, but I always thought Tua was going to be behind Fitzpatrick this year (at least to start. Esp with their O-line situation. They've made team strides, but they need to protect their investment.) Outside of that hot second report that he'd be third string behind Rosen, I haven't been all that worried. Once they got rid of Rosen even with his rookie contract, I felt better. As a Tua owner, I hope he takes the year to learn from the vet while they build their line. He was always a future investment for me."
1806,2020-09-07 23:00:49,io8qrl,"I don‚Äôt think the competition is as strong for Akers as you may think. They‚Äôve had those other guys on the roster, spent a pick on Darrell Henderson, just cut John Kelly who they also drafted recently, and spent a 2nd round pick on Akers. If they thought anyone on the roster had a shot at being a player, I can‚Äôt imagine a team with Salary cap issues like the Rams would spend a 2nd rounder on another RB. He was drafted to be there guy- he easily has the most talent and will be given every chance to maintain the lead back workhorse role."
1807,2020-09-07 20:55:07,io8qrl,I can definitely see that. Kelley has a very realistic work-balance possibility with the Ek. Vaughn will need probably need a teammate to get injured to hit 200 yards this year.
1808,2020-09-07 21:36:04,io8qrl,"I disagree with this approach in dynasty.  If it‚Äôs redraft then missing a couple games should justifiably move guys down your board.  If you thought Reagor was the third best WR (or whatever) up until his injury then he should still be drafted at that spot, especially considering all the praise he been receiving."
1809,2020-09-07 20:48:02,io8qrl,"Ah. Understood, then."
1810,2020-09-07 17:04:53,io8qrl,"I know they were hurting for Cap space after some big signings, Goff, AD, Ramsey etc.  But they‚Äôre obviously going to resign Kupp right?   I just don‚Äôt see where Van Jefferson fits in yet unless an injury happens.  Obviously we‚Äôre dynasty so long term applies i understand."
1811,2020-09-07 18:21:03,io8qrl,"Yeah as a massive Ohio state fan and drafter of McLaurin last year, they have a lot of similarities. Terry is an absolute burner and KJ is not, but they both have impeccable route running. I was stunned Hill fell a far in draft. Especially after being projected as a 4-5th rounder the year before. He‚Äôs going to surprise a lot of people."
1812,2020-09-07 21:47:45,io8qrl,I'd give an edge to KJ Hill - either are deeper stashes though.
1813,2020-09-07 20:32:50,io8qrl,Absolutely. It‚Äôs wise to cut bait before the end of the season if you‚Äôre sure your guy didn‚Äôt hit.
1814,2020-09-07 22:58:57,io8qrl,"1.01 for clyde  2.06 for van and traded hunt for gibson and some other pieces before ap got cut, I didn't wanna move hunt but I needed a qb, 14 team league"
1815,2020-09-07 17:29:29,io8qrl,"Definitely could be dealing with discomfort, but it sounds like there is serious optimism that he only misses [one week](https://twitter.com/JClarkNBCS/status/1302995503043547136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1302995503043547136%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bleedinggreennation.com%2F2020%2F9%2F7%2F21426098%2Fjalen-reagor-injury-update-eagles-nfl-news-fantasy-football-philadelphia-wide-receiver-week-2-game). On top of that, immediate opportunity had to do with some of the draw with Reagor, but it's almost a guarantee that he's going to be seeing even more opportunity next year with Alshon and DJax gone."
1816,2020-09-07 21:04:27,io8qrl,I got Ruggs at 1.12.
1817,2020-09-07 23:10:34,io8qrl,"That's fair. I don't mean that Edwards is their consensus WR1 or anything, just that there's been nonstop camp hype about Edwards and very little about Ruggs for the 1st WR taken in the draft, which is a little surprising. I've heard a lot more about some of the other first round WRs.

As for JT, I'm with you, I was hoping for a big camp. But also in this day and age that's just how some coaches work. They want to make their rookies work for it, and sometimes shitty vets get announced as a ""starter"" when we all know they won't be the starter by week 2. Remember tyrod starting for a couple weeks over baker the 1.01 (who then went on to set the rookie qb TD record) or miles Sanders having to earn his starting job and then blowing everyone away at the end of the season? It happens. I put very little stock in performative stuff like that. The coaches also did say that JT was blowing everyone away, and there were some nice highlight videos.

It's interesting also that I've heard very little about CEH in camp for being the only first round RB. I wonder where his stock would be if DWill hadn't decided to sit out the season."
1818,2020-09-08 00:51:04,io8qrl,"Ya, makes me feel better after dropping robinson when we had to trim to season roster size before he was announced as the jax starter the other day."
1819,2020-09-08 00:45:00,io8qrl,Would subscribe
1820,2020-09-08 05:26:24,io8qrl,Then why buy a lottery ticket at all if not to win?
1821,2020-09-08 01:13:19,io8qrl,"Oh that makes more sense actually. 

I guess Swift vs Akers is the disagreement for me

Can you look at the Rams and really say they are a good situation?

Capped out team, awful OL, brutal division, average to below average QB and a coach who has spoken favorably of changing to a committee

I just see a lot of AJ Brown from last year in Swift--the QB is good, offense was good if the QB is healthy, OL is fine but people just see ""Lions"""
1822,2020-09-07 16:16:00,io8qrl,"I 100% agree with the expectation of being behind Fitzmagic.

However, I have a bit of a down tick on him because the feel was that he was still being eased back into *action* which to me feels like they‚Äôre feeling the need to be a **bit** more cautious with the injury than I would prefer to hear.

It‚Äôs probably nothing. But it does blunt some hopes that his recovery would be ahead of schedule and he would light the world on fire - those were part of the possible outcome set, and they‚Äôre not anymore. But yeah good response!"
1823,2020-09-07 23:28:56,io8qrl,I definitely expect Akers to still get that chance. I was just a bit bummed when Brown was able to hold him off for the week 1 start. I‚Äôll check back in for an update 3-4 weeks in and fully expect to see Akers on the rise. :-)
1824,2020-09-07 21:49:15,io8qrl,"Fair! For my approach, I had Ruggs as my WR3 \*\*before the draft\*\* and Reagor moved back ahead because of landing spots/opportunities. Because the injury negates a bit of the ""boost"" for me, it moved Reagor back down. I had the WR3 cluster (Reagor/Jefferson/Ruggs) as extremely close post draft."
1825,2020-09-07 19:41:25,io8qrl,"Their cap situation is complicated. They will have some cap room, but they have three key players to resign in Ramsey, Kupp, and John Johnson. That's assuming they just let Floyd, Hill, and Everett leave.  
  
If the current cap estimates hold and they re-sign Ramsey, I could see Kupp being the odd man out. If the cap comes in a bit higher than expected, they can move enough money around to sign both, and let Johnson walk."
1826,2020-09-07 18:28:04,io8qrl,"Such a deep WR class, guys were bound to fall. People like Cephus and DPJ and Hill were all likely undervalued as ‚Äúbest on the team‚Äù Big10 guys who might outperform their draft slot."
1827,2020-09-07 23:32:13,io8qrl,"Solid moves! Van at pick 20 might‚Äôve been a bit early at the time but that‚Äôs about where I‚Äôve got him now (19 on my board) so I‚Äôm optimistic. 

Love the Hunt for Gibson move. Hunt might be the better piece in the long haul, but it‚Äôs a worthwhile gamble given the upside."
1828,2020-09-07 17:49:04,io8qrl,"Right. Missing only 1 week would really help getting him moving in the right direction. I'm sure the JJAW/Ward truthers are counting on 2-3 weeks.   
Reagor is the clear talent in that WR room though, no doubt about it. I only slid him 1.5 spots - behind Ruggs and roughly even with Gibson, and that's solely measuring for Gibson's massive present hype - which will either explode into a full on hypepocalypse or the worst let down since Darwin 2019."
1829,2020-09-07 21:07:57,io8qrl,"Dude, Ruggs at 1.12 and then Swift at 2.05? Nice. 2 first round values."
1830,2020-09-07 23:27:23,io8qrl,"Yeah - with Ruggs I think a lot of the issue is when another guy is getting praise in camp, it‚Äôs time the coach is talking about them and not you. But I think they compliment each other well - Ruggs seems to thrive with competent teammates, so Edwards looking like a hit is actually huge for Ruggs who I think might struggle in a talent black hole."
1831,2020-09-08 00:57:07,io8qrl,Aww dang. I talked one of my buddies into taking Robinson 5.01 since our draft goes 7 rounds and I didn‚Äôt have any picks after the 3.03.
1832,2020-09-08 12:12:12,io8qrl,"I‚Äôm saying Gibson owners should know he‚Äôs a lottery ticket - and yes, that‚Äôs why we buy! But the fact that it looks like Washington is intent on giving him a chance at a lot of work should give owners some optimism."
1833,2020-09-08 01:21:21,io8qrl,That‚Äôs fair too. It‚Äôs so close for me with Swift and Akers right now. But I got Taylor so I had to take Swift over Akers if for no other reason than the flawless memes.
1834,2020-09-07 23:51:47,io8qrl,Deep sleeper: Gabriel Davis in Buffalo. He tore up training camp and will have a huge role if Diggs or John Brown get hurt. He will likely take over as the #2 next season if things break right for him. The coaching staff and QB love him.
1835,2020-09-07 21:50:27,io8qrl,"Gotcha, that makes sense"
1836,2020-09-07 21:00:06,io8qrl,You can count Johnson as gone. He‚Äôs the one out of the main 3 that will be leaving for sure. Some cap also opens with whitworth leaving freeing up another 10mill.
1837,2020-09-07 18:41:47,io8qrl,Excellent point. I‚Äôm super high on Cephus as well.
1838,2020-09-08 02:00:16,io8qrl,I wanted Pittman or Edward instead but for now I guess I'm not too upset
1839,2020-09-07 21:19:05,io8qrl,For sure.
1840,2020-09-08 14:43:08,io8qrl,"I understand what you‚Äôre saying. The point of my post is that something doesn‚Äôt resonate. I don‚Äôt believe they are heavily invested in him as they‚Äôre saying. Many sources were saying it was because of Bryce Love‚Äôs performance in camp as the reason for letting Peterson go. His traits translate as a change of pace back whereas Love fits the bell cow mold and demonstrated he‚Äôs capable of taking on that role. 

I do not own either player. Just an observation."
1841,2020-09-08 00:01:06,io8qrl,I loved his metrics. I didn‚Äôt have any draft picks after the 3rd round though.
1842,2020-09-08 02:01:58,io8qrl,"Yeah. I would still have both of those guys over Van, but Van is not far behind riding that hype wave!"
1843,2020-09-07 21:49:48,io8qrl,For a little perspective - that means you got the 1st WR taken and the 2nd RB taken in the NFL draft. That sounds pretty good to me. :)
1844,2020-09-08 15:48:16,io8qrl,Fair points! And we really won‚Äôt have much of an idea until we see how the first few games go.
1845,2020-09-07 21:53:31,io8qrl,"I was ecstatic.  It is a more casual league so I am not too surprised. Just for some context. One person couldn't figure out draft layout and didn't know when she was drafting, but that's the only blunder really. 
And its IDP with free agents available to be drafted. So I'm not too shocked.   But shocked still."
1846,2020-09-08 23:07:27,io8qrl,"And now McKissic is listed as the RB1 going into Sunday‚Äôs game. Who knows, right? Haha. Thank you for the discussion."
1847,2020-09-07 21:54:46,io8qrl,"Yeah, it's still a GREAT get!"
1848,2020-09-07 12:17:45,io61jj,"Yes, the artist‚Äôs image matters a lot, whether you notice it or not"
1849,2020-09-07 17:44:36,io61jj,"Yes. I hate Chris Brown and by extension, his music. I'm not sorry about it. I've always been like this and my line for art vs artist is whether or not the trouble they're in is criminal. Ex: loved Taylor's 1989 but hated the public persona she went for in that era  

Edit: Even if the act is criminal, it's gotta be something that egregiously harms someone else. I don't care about posession."
1850,2020-09-07 15:46:58,io61jj,"I'm struggling with my feelings regarding Lana (one of my all-time favorite artists) and her upcoming album right now for this very reason. She's not ""canceled"" or whatever to me, but my perception of her definitely took a hit with those dumb instagram rants. And unfortunately I don't think I'll be able to listen to Chemtrails without the backdrop of her tone-deaf opinions in the back of my mind, which makes me sad."
1851,2020-09-07 12:15:39,io61jj,"I don't think so to be honest. I'm a huge Madonna fan and I don't think she gets anything like the respect she deserves (at least here) and yet even that didn't make me enjoy her last few albums. 

On the flip side, I think Grimes seems annoying af but I still love her music"

1853,2020-09-07 12:23:27,io61jj,Honestly yes. An artist‚Äôs personality/lifestyle is an important aspect to understand in order to enjoy an album they‚Äôve made.
1854,2020-09-07 13:18:21,io61jj,"Yes 100%. Selena is an artist that I‚Äôve been following since I was a little kid watching her on Disney. Sounds dramatic and cliche but I‚Äôve kinda grown up with her so I‚Äôm gonna check out everything she ever releases. If it‚Äôs not my favourite on first listen, I know that I‚Äôll grow to like it because it‚Äôs coming from the person who‚Äôs been with me for over a decade. Like Rare for example - this sub was very quick to dismiss that album but for me, hearing those lyrics from the artist I‚Äôve been following forever, and also when lyrics really resonate me (and the production is that cool).... it‚Äôs my album of the year. I dont expect non-Selena fans to ever rank the album that high.

Edit: I say that I‚Äôll like almost anything she puts out but I think I‚Äôve found my first exception. Ice Cream. I literally give that song a 1/10."
1855,2020-09-07 15:21:24,io61jj,"Absolutely and I think that people who don't think so are in denial. I find that I'm much more lenient with artists who I already love, whereas the bar of quality needed is much higher with artists I'm indifferent about or ambivalent towards if I'm going to keep listening to their album."
1856,2020-09-07 16:54:37,io61jj,"Actually I'd put it a step further and say that the image of the fans of the artist have influence my opinion over whether or not I'll even check out the artist's works. 

That's a good reason why I steer clear from K-pop. I don't hate it, and they do have some catchy tunes here and there, but the fandom in general is just rabid as hell so I just avoid it as much as possible."
1857,2020-09-07 19:04:52,io61jj,"I don't love albums just because I like the artist, but I definitely give the album more of a chance if I already like the artist beforehand. Folklore is a perfect example. I never would have listened to a folk/alternative/pop album in the first place if I wasn't already a fan of Taylor's music and I absolutely adore that album which also made me look more into similar music. I didn't know whether I would like it beforehand though, I was completely ready to say ""this isn't for me"" and move on."
1858,2020-09-07 12:25:55,io61jj,"If the background of the artist is correlated with the album, then yeah. Like if the content of the album can be explained or is related to what goes on with the artist in real life, then I‚Äôll definitely take it into consideration. Otherwise, if the artist and art can be separated, my opinion of the album is not affected at all. For example, I have a pretty large distaste for Imagine Dragons, but I have a massive amount of respect for Dan Reynolds and his work for the LGBT community. Likewise, MIA saying that she‚Äôs anti-vax was super off-putting, but her discography is too excellent and forward-thinking for me to not give credit to"
1859,2020-09-07 14:47:57,io61jj,I try not to but it‚Äôs inevitable. I think the problem is when the your knowledge of the artist and their image is required to listen to music (like Look What You Made Me Do); if the image enhances a song I think it helps the song (like The Boy Is Mine).
1860,2020-09-07 15:16:21,io61jj,"Absolutely. I can admit when an artist I dislike on a personal level makes a song I enjoy, but the likelihood of me even listening to their music is low if I dislike them to begin with."
1861,2020-09-07 12:42:39,io61jj,Definitely. I actually enjoy both Kim Petras and Doja Cat but I don't listen to their discography because of their connections with Luke. I listened to both their most recent releases and they are good albums but I don't listen to them because of the production behind. I don't have a problem in listening to their features tho.
1862,2020-09-07 12:50:28,io61jj,"For me it's totally a case by case basis. 

Melanie Martinez I had actively negative opinions of, and I would never have listened to her stuff if I hadn't been cooking while watching an AjayII reaction video, and it autoplayed her reaction to K-12 while my hands were covered in eggs and flour. I listened to her reaction to the first track, Wheels on the Bus, and then flipped over to her album. Loved the production, enjoyed the lyrics and storytelling, and now I'm really interested to see where he takes her sound next. 

Same honestly for XXXTentacion - I listened to his stuff having read a lot about him and the awful things he did, but after listening I totally understood why he had a massive fanbase, cause he's really just going for all out vulnerability in his music, and he was really at the forefront of creating an exciting an new sound blending hip hop, emo rock, and a bunch of other genres together. And since he was dead when I really listened, I didn't have any moral qualms about supporting him."
1863,2020-09-07 14:35:41,io61jj,"It's often hard for opinion of artist not to affect opinion of art by that artist.  A song or album comes with a context that the artist is a part of.  They are often linked on a fundamental level.

How strongly they are linked can vary some.  A song can be written by and performed by different people and be less personal.  Even in such cases, it often will still capture a sentiment that that the performer ascribes to--and that's relevant context too.

It sometimes comes up that a song doesn't ""feel like them.""  IMO, there's a spectrum between two ways to process that.  1. They really aren't being genuine to their ""true self"" (which we're experts on, right?) or, 2. Our understanding of their ""true self"" is incomplete and has caught us by surprise.  I suspect we often reach for option one despite not really knowing a person well enough.

Also it's worth reminding that change is part of the human experience.  Maybe they've changed and that's part of the context too.  I think these things evolve together and that's ok.

It can be hard to not let expectation drive opinion which can lead to disappointment traps.  Do we then throw context to the wind and take in everything as new?  It's a weird wonderful balancing act.

Expect some baggage, expect some change, and don't let first impressions be last impressions, IMO.  Life be messy."
1864,2020-09-07 15:16:58,io61jj,"Yes and no. 

For the artists that I know any thing about, Thierry image and character does influence what I think of the album. Sometimes that's a deeper appreciate--ie Taylor and Kanye's music. In other cases it casts a negative taste--Brock Hampton's Saturation Trilogy. 

But I know very little about most of the artists whose music I love. Like I know almost nothing beyond basic biographic detail (age, gender, sexuality, maybe a past partner) about most of the artists I like such as: Halsey, Lorde, Carly Rae, Charli, Phoebe Brigders, Ariana Grande, Tessa Violet, Clairo, BENEE, Oh Wonder, Conan Gray, Banks, Billie Eilish, b√ºlow, C≈ìur de Pirate, Echosmith, Foster the People, fun., Julia Michaels, Kailee Morgue, Lana, Limbo, Marina, Sigrid, Tegan and Sara. 

hell, I don't even what most of them even look like. I could have an entire conversation with most of them and never realize who they were."
1865,2020-09-07 15:15:22,io61jj,"Definitely. it's hard for me to separate art from artist.

Obviously because of my flair I do make exceptions ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
1866,2020-09-07 17:12:20,io61jj,Yes. I dont believe in separating the art from the artist.
1867,2020-09-10 20:47:29,io61jj,No. I don‚Äòt like Taylor Swifts Personality. I love folklore.
1868,2020-09-07 16:24:38,io61jj,"Definitely, especially when artists don't write their own songs. I can listen to a song and love it, and then find out they didn't write it and it just ruins it. I don't mind with something upbeat and fun but when it's a personal song or even just something a little emotional it still feels so weird? Like they're singing about someone else's experiences but putting it on their body of work. A cover is different because it's usually presented as such or at least commonly known as such but when the only clue is in the songwriters credit, it just feels ingenuine no matter how much of a common practice it is"
1869,2020-09-07 17:19:54,io61jj,"Not really. Just because I like an artist's persona doesn't mean I'll automatically enjoy all of their releases. I was a major Lady Gaga fan during her Born This Way era and I still didn't like Artpop for a loong time. I still adore Marina, but L+F was still a meh album overall.

However, if I dislike an artist, I'll definitely be a lot more judgmental of their work. Or if I don't like their most well-known songs, I'll be less inclined to give their albums a chance, even when they're well reviewed and have a lot of fans ~~tried listening to Melodrama and felt bad bc i felt like i was incapable of giving it a chance~~"
1870,2020-09-07 16:33:05,io61jj,"I agree. While Witness was definitely worse than Teenage Dream and Prism, I feel like a big part of it flopping was Katy's new image."
1871,2020-09-07 17:04:46,io61jj,"The 'question for the culture' thing sounds pretentious af. I love Lana but dear god... even her 50s aesthetics is just so tiring. It's just so overdone. Why's she keeps romanticising that era, I'll never understand üò∂"
1872,2020-09-07 21:54:56,io61jj,The death of Lana‚Äôs ‚Äúcool factor‚Äù is truly the most underrated death of 2020.
1873,2020-09-07 16:01:06,io61jj,Ugh Grimes hits home. Ever since she started dating Elon Musk and pretending like he‚Äôs not union busting or any of the countless other things... I literally cannot listen to her anymore. It‚Äôs just frustration > everything now.
1874,2020-09-07 12:21:10,io61jj,Same for Grimes. Art Angels is amazing
1875,2020-09-07 19:04:43,io61jj,What was wrong about Madam X? If her overly autotuned voice on most songs and lead single choice were an issue then I understand. Nevertheless it was a good album compared to MDNA and Rebel Heart. I like it!

1883,2020-09-08 02:02:40,io61jj,"Oh really, I loved Past Life, I‚Äôve still got that on replay to this day. I know the trap sound is kinda generic now but I honestly think it really suits her voice and I wouldn‚Äôt mind to hear some more (solo) songs with that sound. And yeah her openness about mental health is one of the main reasons I support her, and I loooooove it when she puts that into music"
1884,2020-09-07 23:10:51,io61jj,Give A Sweeter Place and People You Know another shot. Like with good quality headphones or speakers. They‚Äôve made my way into my top 20 songs of 2020. Even hiphopheads really liked A Sweeter Place and that sub normally hates pop songs. Both songs are bops with amazing production and lyrics that I can definitely relate to lol
1885,2020-09-07 14:06:53,io5r96,I always sing ‚Äúdo the girls back home f**k you like I do‚Äù lolz

1887,2020-09-07 18:41:28,io5r96,"Okay, this doesn't fit the song at all, but I was in traffic road raging a couple weeks ago and did this, and now I feel the need to share.

I was listening to *the lakes* and instead of singing: ""I don't belong, and my beloved, neither do you"" I sang **""I don't belong, and MOTHERFUCKER NEITHER DO YOU""** and now I sometimes sing it that way to continue to laugh at my ridiculous ass."

Like in I Think He Knows she sings ‚Äúhand on my thigh we can follow the sparks I‚Äôll drive‚Äù 

That being said, I love her well placed cursing! I would love it if she slipped it into older songs during live performances!"

My heart, my hips, my body, my love

Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch

Gave up on me like I was a bad drug

Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club



Our songs, our films, united, we stand

Our country, guess it was a lawless land  

Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand  

Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans


My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust

Tryna find a part of me you didn't *fuck* up

Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough

But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts"
1905,2020-09-07 19:55:41,io5r96,"Like other people have said, the one thing I appreciate about Taylor's music is that she doesn't just curse because she can. Curse words aren't just a vehicle to make her songs more ""adult"" they're carefully curated to paint a very specific picture. If she cursed through an entire song -or an entire album even- you immediately lose whatever sense of anger or regret that she expresses in the few times she chooses to swear. The line in Betty, ""would you lead me to the garden or tell me to go f\*\*k myself?"" would be made so much weaker if Taylor had been singing f\*\*k the entire time. That's not to say I'm opposed to an entire album with cursing, as I'm sure even Taylor could make it elegant as f\*\*k, but I do think she's been very wise so far with how she incorporates more mature dialogue in her music."
1906,2020-09-07 18:31:21,io5r96,"I actually don‚Äôt think cursing adds much to her songs, with the exception of: *If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing.* I think it‚Äôs more impressive when someone can pinpoint their feelings without resorting to generic curses."
1907,2020-09-08 17:54:01,io5r96,"For YEARS I could have sworn that she was saying ‚Äúlikes it rough, he‚Äôs taking off his coat‚Äù"
1908,2020-09-07 13:02:46,io5r96,"Part of the reason I like Taylor Swift's songs is that they're not really explicit or ""adult""

1911,2020-09-07 12:35:46,io5r96,The point of the re-recordings is to be used for licensing and promotional purposes. I see no way that she would add explicit language which would prevent the licensing she‚Äôs expecting lol

1929,2020-09-07 17:40:24,io5r96,I kind of dislike this one because it has homophobic connotations. (Though genius explains that she just wants the man to have difficulties in seeking another relationship but still...) Glad they removed it.
1930,2020-09-07 14:10:14,io5r96,"I don't know why this got down-voted because I agree! I actually appreciate the fact that there's minimal cursing in her songs, given that the industry is so saturated with songs that have too much cursing in them. It's as if she's still able to convey the intensity of her emotions without them. And when she does use them, they're very well-placed. She doesn't just sing them for the sake it. 

That said, I like the ""lights are off, he's taking off his clothes."" I thought about the changing of ""dreaming"" to ""drinking"" in 22 as mentioned above, and it does sound like it fits, but doing so would ultimately end up changing the entire message of the song so I can't concur."

1934,2020-09-07 16:26:55,io5r96,There's a rumour that drinking was in the original version of the song.

1936,2020-09-07 19:00:57,io5r96,"Yeah... I definitely agree. There's just something with Taylor's songs and the ability to curse without cursing... Compared to many other songs which can't seem to find a workaround, and seem to be aimed at more ""adult"" audiences..."

2073,2020-10-10 17:03:59,j8k2ow,If you have really really high stealth you can do it legit and go around the spider to speak to him.
2074,2020-10-10 15:01:30,j8k2ow,In my game he always dies to the draugr further into the dungeon. Though now I really want to see what happens If I turn him essential and he makes it to the end.
2075,2020-10-10 15:58:11,j8k2ow,He does. I tried it and killed all the dragur before they got him. Still dies at the trap
2076,2020-10-10 18:31:26,j8k2ow,He gets killed by the draugr almost immediately.
2077,2020-10-10 17:01:10,j8k2ow,Nah if you cut him down he just calls you a fool and runs away. Same as normal.
2078,2020-10-10 16:42:41,j8k2ow,"He will probably leave and go to a tavern. Most NPCs who have a ‚Äúescape‚Äù route or something like that, if they somehow don‚Äôt die, just end up in a tavern somewhere"
2079,2020-10-10 17:00:44,j8k2ow,Yeah but what if he‚Äôs essential? He literally can‚Äôt die if I turn him essential. Ima try that now haha
2080,2020-10-11 00:52:10,j8k2ow,If he survives the spike trap he'll just continue to try and kill you.
2081,2020-10-10 16:44:21,j8k2ow,Part of me thinks that won‚Äôt happen with Taylor. Part of me thinks he‚Äôll just disappear if he makes it to the exit because he‚Äôs not supposed to be able to leave. Another part of me is now really curious to try this out.
2082,2020-10-10 17:01:56,j8k2ow,Please let me know what happens! I'm picturing the spike trap stabbing him over and over
2083,2020-10-10 16:47:14,j8k2ow,"Well, if his death isn‚Äôt scripted like Lokir, I feel like the devs would want him to have a destination just in case"
2084,2020-10-10 17:03:59,j8k2ow,Im just picturing him disappearing at the loading screen that leads deeper into the narrow. Maybe I‚Äôll post a video of it. Depends on what happens Haha
2085,2020-10-10 17:00:01,j8k2ow,I remember seeing a video where someone removed the archers at helgen and Lokir did run away instead of just disappearing. Lol ill go and try this with Taylor as I really need to know now haha
2086,2020-10-10 17:24:35,j8k2ow,"According to his page on UESP, he just stops moving after the swinging blade trap."
2087,2020-10-10 20:18:43,j8k2ow,"aww, i was looking forward to him also finding out he's dragon born and saving the world from alduin for me"
2088,2020-10-10 21:16:13,j8k2ow,"That'd be a neat mod idea - every quest you do, he's been one step ahead of you, too swift for you to keep up with. And then finally at the end, you have to fight him like the rival from Pok√©mon."

2094,2020-10-10 09:38:05,j8hkg6,"It starts with desperation. Scenario example - 

There's a toxic friendship, I've known for sometime, I'm too delusional to admit it but once desperation hits that's when everything clicks. It could be an opening, an argument, anything. 

The result - a sense of nothingness - no connection with the person, no meaning, they're just a stranger. That's it. Nothing more. The damage is done.  

Aftermath - Recovery and working on the self which takes time. The anger is slowly building up inside and I do not like expressing so I must find ways to manage this. I learn my lesson. 

Personally, one of my biggest regrets is not doing the doorslam earlier and attempting change to better myself.  Instead, giving passes to people who shouldn't have meant anything in the first place. Part of it is myself for being delusional and overly unrealistic giving people chances whilst having my own bad behaviours too. 

This makes me appreciate people who appreciate me even more. These situations probably are making me realise what can make me a better friend."
2095,2020-10-10 10:53:01,j8hkg6,"Sounds like you're on a similar page to me, my friend... the indifference bothers other people who don't understand it more than it bothers me, I think. And I definitely feel you in regards to the second chances! I forgive people over and over until one day it's just all too much. I think it's important to forgive, but it's also important to know your boundaries and not let the urge to forgive cross those lines. 

I find it interesting that you mention anger in the aftermath, though - I generally don't have an angry temperament, but I do feel a sense of betrayal and disappointment strongly for a time. It's a balance between our own (often too high) expectations and also fighting for the appreciation, respect and loyalty we deserve. But it's definitely a balance we can learn with time and experience."
2096,2020-10-10 11:54:02,j8hkg6,"I don't have an angry temperament either, far from it but it does build up inside, this is accumulated from multiple things though not just door slam. I agree time and experience does help with situations like this."
2097,2020-10-10 11:45:10,j8fs6i,"I was able to buy my ticket for fifth row for the Melodrama tour a couples months after they were released. That being said, I went to the show in Des Moines, so I‚Äôm sure that changes city by city."
2098,2020-10-10 12:57:04,j8fs6i,I was able to get a ticket to the Atlanta concert on the Melodrama tour about a month before the concert and they were good seats. You might have to pay a little extra but it‚Äôll be worth it!
2099,2020-10-10 16:52:07,j8fs6i,she will probably tour in 2022 or 2023 and maybe the pandemic will have calmed down but lets not get too ahead she still need to release album before tour lol
2100,2020-10-10 14:09:21,j8fs6i,"I was at both of her previous tours, the tickets didn‚Äôt sell out fast. However, she‚Äôs gained a lot more fans since Melodrama so it might sell out faster now."
2101,2020-10-10 22:47:47,j8fs6i,yesss that would be sooo amazing
2102,2020-10-10 23:01:20,j8fs6i,"Lorde seems to have a cult following (us here), and so the dedicated fan base to going to see her live is much smaller than you‚Äôd think. Didn‚Äôt have a problem booking tickets to go see her in Australia."

2165,2020-10-10 03:19:28,j8d4nx,"I‚Äôm no expert but it sounds to me like you are downplaying what happened with your boyfriend. Yes it might have not been a big deal, but it happened and you are allowed to have feelings about it. Saying things like ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt even a fight‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a big deal‚Äù is effectively a negative thought because it is the same as saying that just because it was a minor thing, you shouldn‚Äôt be having any feelings. 
So a simple way to rework that into a positive is to just say, ‚ÄúI am allowed to have feelings even about small things.‚Äù 

Sometimes even if we don‚Äôt know the source of our feelings, it‚Äôs still helpful to just own it, acknowledge it and let it go. You know you‚Äôre bummed, and you know that you‚Äôre connecting to those songs right now, and that‚Äôs enough. 
Maybe do a journaling to ask yourself what it‚Äôs is about the music that you like? Is it just the melody? is it the lyrics? If it‚Äôs the lyrics then maybe writing them
down and then writing about why you relate to them. If it‚Äôs the tone of her voice, explain why that‚Äôs something you like. Sometimes just breaking things down into small questions can help unravel bigger stuff. 

And if you can‚Äôt figure it out right now that‚Äôs okay too."
2166,2020-10-10 03:40:09,j8d4nx,"I think you might be using those song lyrics as a way to distract from the work you need to be doing. Do you have an endgame in mind on what kind of person you want to be, or what you're trying to accomplish, through the workbook CBT work? Or maybe the fight is a huge distraction and piling too much pressure on at once?"
2167,2020-10-10 03:23:00,j8d4nx,"Yeah I'll have to agree, with this you might be downplaying the interaction you had with your SO. Maybe explore that in your writing, you might get more ideas going there"

2173,2020-10-10 01:15:20,j8avox,"One thing that I appreciated about Naya‚Äôs voice over Lea‚Äôs and Amber‚Äôs was that the creators/producers never encouraged her to mimic someone else‚Äôs voice, but just to improve her technique and be herself. 

While Amber and Lea are also naturally amazing singers, a major problem on GLEE and with that pop album Lea released is that they were often being encouraged to vocally emulate Barbara Streisand, Idina Menzel, Aretha Franklin, Beyonc√©, and other pop stars, rather than just learning to work properly with the strengths of their *own* naturally bright and light-lyric soprano voices. 

Lea, particularly in later seasons after she underwent that unnatural shift in her vocal timbre for that pop album she released, would over-use her chest voice to try to unnaturally darken and roughen up her sound to try to sound more like Idina Menzel and/or Barbara Streisand, and it didn‚Äôt sound right at all in later seasons.

While classically trained before GLEE, Amber was
probably encouraged by the producers to try to belt like Aretha Franklin, which is why sometimes those belted high notes at the top sounded a little bit too tight and strained.

Naya just stuck with her *own* natural vocal timbre, and just worked on improving her technique, rather than trying to vocally emulate someone she was not."
2174,2020-10-10 01:07:58,j8avox,"I really enjoyed this! Thanks!

I always preferred her lower range. I don‚Äôt know why the show always made people with great lower ranges go high. 

I would only add that Lea actually received surprisingly little formal training. And Naya *did* have a voice coach when she was younger although she claims it did more harm than good in the short-term. She didn‚Äôt come into the show with no training. 

Amber probably had the most training coming into the show."
2175,2020-10-10 02:25:47,j8avox,"While I can believe that Lea Michele was not classically trained with private lessons/classes, I *do* believe she would have *had* to have been at least somewhat professionally trained in proper breathing, belting, and projection techniques when she was working on Broadway for years during rehearsals and workshops to eventually end up being great enough to earn a lead role in a musical at the tender age of 18. Her belted notes at the top could sometimes be a little too piercing and harsh because she didn‚Äôt always soften them with enough head voice and vibrato, but in Spring Awakening and from S1-S3 of GLEE I thought that, for the most part, Lea‚Äôs vocal technique was generally pretty consistently excellent. It was in S4 when she released that pop album when it really started to go downhill because she abandoned her uniquely bright, bubbly, light, high, and youthful natural lyric soprano timbre, adopted this unnaturally dark, husky, low, and more mature one that just didn‚Äôt suit her, lost her great breath control, and just completely stopped trying to use a well-balanced mixed voice (chest/head) to layer in her upper belts by going through mostly straight chest voice all the way through. Her producers seemed to encourage her to vocally and physically emulate Barbara Streisand and Idina Menzel more and more every season on GLEE, rather than just having her work with her own natural vocal strengths.

On a side note, I didn‚Äôt know that Lea Michele had received very little formal training until just recently, and having learned that she actually didn‚Äôt receive much professional vocal training at all outside of her Broadway workshops and rehearsals, I feel like I have lost some respect for her that I once had. Yes, it‚Äôs true that classical singing and musical theater singing are two different beasts. Classical singing generally requires a low larynx to create a lot of space, resonance, and vibrato in the mouth/throat, so that the voice can easily be heard over a large audience without a microphone without having to strain your to sound louder over them. In classical music, vowels are usually supposed to be rounded and pure. However, in musical theater, strong vibrato on every note isn‚Äôt always required, and having pure rounded vowels often isn‚Äôt as important, unless you‚Äôre singing a musical theater piece that incorporates a lot of classical technique.

This is why having classical vocal training as a foundation makes transitioning into musical theater singers easier. It makes them more versatile, A mezzo and/or soprano could pull off belter ballad roles of Fanny Brice from Funny Girl, Elphaba from Wicked, and Wendla from Spring Awakening, while also being able to pull off the more classical sounding music theater roles of Grizzabella from CATS, Christine Daae from POTO, Cuengonde, from Candide, Maria from West Side Story, Fantine and Cosette from Les Mis, Glinda from Wicked, Eliza from My Fair Lady, Eva Peron from Evita, and so many more. 

Lea Michele basically getting lucky enough to get two featured extra roles opportunities on Broadway with little to no formal prior training under her belt in her free time before or after kind of pisses me off because a lot of people working in musical theater with more private formal vocal training, more prior experience, and more credentials have to work for *years* in the background before finally getting a lead or featured role in an official musical. Yet, she has the nerve to brag about being so lucky to be on Broadway with very little professional training under her belt outside of rehearsals and workshops for her shows. Then again, this kind of explains why Rachel got everything she wanted in the professional world of musical theater handed to her on a silver platter, in spite of having little to no prior experience working in professional musical theater productions. 

And yeah, I get that the role of little Cosette in Les Mis is specifically written for a little girl‚Äôs voice, but I would still think that many casting directors would want someone with at least *some* sort of professional private training in singing in their free time in order to give them a role as a featured extra. Lea didn‚Äôt even originally plan on auditioning for the role of little Cosette. She came to the audition with one of her friends to support her, and decided to try out herself. She would have been too young and inexperienced to really have that much of an ego back then, but I bet that very lucky opportunity of her getting the role of little Cosette in Les Mis by just suddenly deciding to try out on the spot was the moment those seeds of arrogance and entitlement were planted. 

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Lea‚Äôs parents, or one of her other relatives held sway in the production when she amazingly made her Broadway debut in the featured extra role of little Cosette in Les Miserables. Yes, I‚Äôm sure she had a good voice back then, too, but I‚Äôm sure that it didn‚Äôt become as amazing as it did in Spring Awakening out of nowhere. 

Anyway, I got off topic and went on a tangent. Where was I? Oh, yes, Amber Riley. As for Amber, yes, she was classically trained, she has an amazing voice, and she became a pretty superb belter with a pretty well-balanced use of mixed voice throughout her lower and upper belted range, which resulted in a naturally beautiful, bright, clear, and youthful consistent and nuanced timbre throughout her song covers with good vibrato, but sometimes, I got kind of annoyed by how much the producers seemed to push her to vocally emulate Aretha Franklin and Beyonc√©. Sometimes, it sounded like those notes at the upper part of her belted range could be a little bit raspy, and if it were up to her, I feel like she would know better than to do that, particularly since she‚Äôs been classically trained. She also sometimes struggled with those long and complex vocal riffs and melismas in the songs she was given."

She basically grew up next to Lea Michele on Broadway, but got so diminished next to her on GLEE because she wasn‚Äôt a powerhouse belter like her. I‚Äôm not sure whether she had any sort of classical training beforehand, but I imagine that, like Lea, she would have at least *had* to have been professionally trained in proper breathing and theatrical belting/projection singing techniques at rehearsals and workshops for the shows she was in. She also actually stuck with proper mixed belting techniques, too, and didn‚Äôt try so hard to overpower everyone by going full-on chest voice like Lea sometimes did either, but critics complained that her voice wasn‚Äôt strong enough."

enchanted as a duet between Camilla and Charles when they first meet before either are married

come back be here sung by Camilla after they break up the first time (could also be a duet)

I could see a lot of different love songs here possibly a duet of sorts between Diana and Andrew Bowles who both think they're in love while the other person has different feelings

\*theoretically if this was a play I could see the first act ending here with both of them married and then I picks back up years later\*

this love as a duet between Charles and Camilla when their affair starts

cold as you sung by Diana when she first finds out about the affair

I agree that illicit affairs is good, I could even see it being sung by Diana and Camilla though. the first part is Diana talking to Camilla about her knowing of the affair and then they can come together to sing to Charles about the whole secret language/colors part 

mad woman sung by Diana to Charles mostly, but the wanting me dead has brought you two together line is about both of them

don't blame me sung by Camilla

\*the whole thing could end here with them divorcing or it could go on till after Diana's death, possibly till Camilla and Charles marry. the only reason I say this is because I think it would be cool for one song in particular to be sung, but it might make the plot a bit too messy\*

the best day sung by prince William after Diana's death about his time with her. It kind of fits perfectly since it mentions a little brother and stuff. It could even use dramatic irony in the part "" I know you're not scared of anything at all"" because we know the times he's recalling she was.

if you wanted to extend it you could put a lot of other songs here sung by both boys, Camilla, Charles, and even possibly the queen. idk it's just a thought, but over all a really awesome idea :)"

The idea that you‚Äôre the FIRST person in the world who has realised that this guys music dreams are unlikely is arrogant as all hell. 

My sister in law got a similar degree and no, she‚Äôs not famous. She‚Äôs now a producer at an ad agency that does music bits for commercials. As she is now SAG, she‚Äôs got killer insurance and makes a pretty decent living (college debts nearly paid off as well).

So I'm just going to put it out there that I'm a pretty ""blunt"" person and I tend to tell things how it is. I'm not someone who ""sucks up"" to people. My issue is... am I being the asshole when I tell people certain things they need to know about life? Success doesn't come easily and people need to know it takes a lot of hard work and dedication.

One particular example is, I know a person who is going to a private music school where tuition is ~$17k a semester(so that's basically $136k for 4 years). I asked him what he wanted to do and he said he wanted to be basically an artist/producer(think like a big singer like Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Eminem, etc...). He has some songs out on some website that only have ~100 views and I listened to them and tbh I did not think they were great. I asked him what kind of audience was he targeting. He told me ""whoever likes his stuff."" That didn't make sense to me because in one of his songs the lyrics talk about a cat but then it also has cuss words, so the lyrics are like catering to a young audience(kids) but then with cuss words that wouldn't work. I asked him if he had a ""Back-up plan"" in case this thing didn't pan out for him and he said no. I told him that he's free to pursue his dreams but if they don't work out he needs to have another plan. How is he planning on paying that kind of tuition? He got upset with me for being a ""downer"" and not believing he'd make it. 

AITA for being realistic?

A backup plan for pursuing the arts is essential‚Äî it‚Äôs a sad reality, but hundreds of thousands of other people think they have that x-factor, and they very well might, but if they don‚Äôt have the resources, money, or connections, their chances of ‚Äòmaking it‚Äô or even making enough from their art to pay off school are slim. 

That being said, your AH status is completely contingent on *how* you asked your friend if he had a backup plan. 

A NTA from me, depending on whether we learn more about this situation.."
2233,2020-11-10 11:16:58,jqyz19,NTA as long as you said it nicely.

2235,2020-11-09 16:42:34,jqyz19,">What, you have a problem with people bluntly telling you you are being an absolute asshole?

No, I don't have a problem with it, I just didn't think that'd be the reason for people to be already be influenced by bias before making their judgement.

>Imagine how much worse it would feel for your friends to start telling you the truth unprompted and judging your every assholish decision.

Don't know what you're trying to perpetuate here but I'd rather people be honest with me then lie to my face. If they have a problem or issue with me, I'd rather they tell me so we can address the issue instead of pretending everything's fine and dandy. I made this post to find out if trying to tell people what would be ""best(in my opinion)"" for them was me being an asshole and the takeaway I got is, if people didn't ask me for my opinion, I shouldn't say it. I didn't come here to be attacked on my personal values."
2236,2020-11-10 18:10:03,jqyz19,Hilarious!!
2237,2020-11-10 11:35:48,jqyz19,"They also like to use, ""I'm just being honest.""

I can't understand how people are so self-centered that they can't understand the value of using a modicum of tact. Shitting on someone's dream, telling them their music sucks (which is exactly what ""Do you have a back-up plan?"" is right after you listen to their music) is just being mean. 

Being ""honest"" is not  the same thing as attacking people because you're a 30 year old edgelord who is just soooo above everybody else and doesn't bow to the will of other people like some plebe. 

YTA for sure."
2238,2020-11-09 15:04:34,jqyz19,I agree. The post reminded me of all the people who were doing horribly at life but felt the need to tell me I was doing everything wrong when I was in college. There isn't one bit of unsolicited advice from those people that I took.

So I'm the asshole for wanting what's best for them, if they didn't ask for my advice? Is this how it feels trying to be a parent when your kid doesn't listen to you?"
2240,2020-11-09 15:11:52,jqyz19,"Exactly. Genuinely blunt people are blunt when they are **ASKED** their input on a subject. Not so genuinely blunt people use it as a way to act like they're more knowledgeable, while that could be true, and as an excuse to be a patronizing asshole."

Yes, for now, my point was that this person should have another source of income(aka a back-up plan), in case his music career doesn't work out. Your sister in law found something else, she didn't try to force it and be a singer. 

>But if your whole defense is ‚Äúwell sorry I‚Äôm blunt,‚Äù or ‚Äúwell what I‚Äôm not supposed to have an opinion?‚Äù

Not my whole defense, I just feel like people need doses of reality. How many times has life turned out exactly the way you planned it? I just don't want this person to end up with heavy student debt and no way to pay it back. Why do you think the US has a problem with student debt in the first place? I worked while I was in college, it's how I managed to pay for my costs, my tuition was also 1/4th the amount of this person's per semester."

Parents have legal and moral duties to their children to craft them into happy adults who can contribute to society in some way. Children do not have the same capability to make logical decisions as people who are older. Instead, you're just someone he happened to meet along his life journey. 

No one asked for your advice, so don't give it. I'm assuming he's an adult, so he can make his own decisions. If you don't like those decisions, don't be friends with him. Point blank."

But that‚Äôs not the issue here: the issue is whether it was appropriate for you to tell him this. Which I believe it was not. If anything you‚Äôll just make him more defiant to prove you wrong. 

The determining factor in whether or not he‚Äôs flexible enough to do something different with his degree is not you giving rude, unsolicited advise disguised as a ‚Äúdose of reality.‚Äù Only time will tell what this guy will do and how resilient he is. 

I also understand what you mean about student debt and responsible assumption of debt when you‚Äôre young. Again though it‚Äôs not your job to mention this to him. At MOST, and only if asked or there was an opening, you might ask when his loan payments start and where he might work right after graduation (‚Äúhave you looked at the advertising industry? I heard they pay pretty well and let you access their recording equipment after hours...‚Äù) Even then, you‚Äôre treading. 

I‚Äôve been the blunt friend. Most of my friends would still tell you I‚Äôm pretty blunt but I like to think I‚Äôve tempered this to opinions about other things (the student debt crisis in general), not people. 

Remember just because you feel the need to say something and that what you‚Äôre saying is probably correct, doesn‚Äôt mean the other person needs to *hear* it or is even capable of hearing it right now. You‚Äôll get a LOT further by being a supportive and empathetic friend in general."

2451,2020-11-09 17:27:07,jqv0z2,100 GBP was still a bit of a stretch for me to pay and I maybe wouldn‚Äôt pay that much but it‚Äôs gone already anyways. :/
2452,2020-11-10 01:53:43,jqv0z2,Sold today but buyer is having issues paying.
2453,2020-11-10 01:46:22,jqv0z2,Is it really sold already? I thought it was an auction
2454,2020-11-09 21:02:02,jqv0z2,Are we allowing members to post their ebay listings here? OP is the seller of this item.
2455,2020-11-10 02:04:53,jqv0z2,Sold today but buyer is having issues paying.
2456,2020-11-09 21:04:38,jqv0z2,"I mean I guess so as long as it‚Äôs a real one. People have posted other listings from other sellers that they thought were real or were a good deal (including myself), so I don‚Äôt see why people can‚Äôt post their own listings if they want to let other collectors in this subreddit know about it. This one is obviously real. But if I suspect one that is for sale by a user is fake I will have to remove the post."
2457,2020-11-10 20:41:11,jqv0z2,"No other fan subreddit allows the users to submit their ebay listings, or charge more for than retail. Almost all music sub reddits I am part of, only allow users to sell their merchandise/autographs for retail value, meaning folklores for $25, and Lover booklets for $5. All else would turn this place into another Mercari, eBay or depop. Trades are also welcome. 

You are inviting frauds and re-sellers to come here and sell their fakes if this is the policy going forward. Without inspecting an autograph IN PERSON, photographs are much more inferior to use as a baseline for fraud. This subreddit shouldn't be used for people to post their eBay listing."
2458,2020-11-10 21:03:31,jqv0z2,"I obviously wasn‚Äôt likely going to allow 5+ posts a day and if someone kept posting their autographs constantly or it seemed that resellers were inserting themselves in here, but I think the occasional listing might be alright. I don‚Äôt know how we‚Äôre supposed to tell if someone is listing their own autograph, so it‚Äôs not obvious unless they say it‚Äôs theirs. I obviously wouldn‚Äôt appreciate someone posting a signed CD for $250 or something so I wouldn‚Äôt allow that. We all know how ridiculous price gouging is with Taylor merch let alone Taylor autographs.

I will eventually look into fixing the rules on this subreddit because all new subreddits come with the standard rules and I wasn‚Äôt sure how to change them right when I started it or what rules should be put in place. But I take advice from others since I have said before I haven‚Äôt had much moderating experience but I assume we all know common sense and decent as adults (most of us are adults I‚Äôd guess). So I will see how things go and can put rules in place if things get out of hand, because I certainly don‚Äôt want resellers to post their expensive listings here.

But I really doubt there would be someone even here who is an actual Taylor fan who would sell their signed ‚ÄòLover‚Äô album booklet for $5 because they know what it‚Äôs worth and what it goes for. So that doesn‚Äôt make it all cut and dry or obvious if someone is a reseller or not. All listings (or 99.9% of them) that we‚Äôve shared here to show other fans if they wanted to buy an autograph for a decent price from some other seller have been more than their original prices. It‚Äôs unfortunate but that‚Äôs how things are now a days and people won‚Äôt list things for their face value and try to make a profit off of it, especially resellers who want 2x+ more for what an autograph‚Äôs face value is."
2459,2020-11-16 03:06:56,jqv0z2,"I am also part of other communities where the rules clearly state that no one is allowed to sell anything above face value. Trades are accepted as well.

I won't be continuing to frequent this sub if people are going to be allowed to sell their merchandise (whether for $2.00 or $1000.) If people want to sell their items for more than face value, they should use the other avenues that already exist, like eBay, depop etc, and not advertise here.

Wasn't the point of this sub's creation and existence to be about verifying the authenticity of autographs? 

When did it become a marketplace for re-sellers?"
2460,2020-11-16 03:15:13,jqv0z2,"I wasn't the one who created the reselling post. I didn't notice it was the person selling it who posted it. I didn't realize this place became a marketplace. Because it didn't.

I'm on the fence about it because I'm not sure what should be done or what the rules should be, but no one can obviously buy and sell on here directly. They would have to take it somewhere else like 'eBay' or even 'PayPal' where they can do a transaction. But I personally think if someone says they want to sell something (that is reasonable and not like five times the price of a merch item) it isn't extremely harmful. Someone posting something for sale doesn't mean someone on here absolutely has to buy it at that price or that a posting on here means someone here HAS to buy it. If something looks obviously fake, I would delete those posts also. And if people begin to post a lot of their own listings I guess it'll have to stop in general or be restricted because the priority of this subreddit isn't for scalpers to sell on here.

But like I said I'm still not sure what should be done. If someone posts something that's outrageous in price obviously I would delete that post, because that's just rude to be a scalper on here where real fans share posts and pictures of autographs."

2463,2020-11-09 11:04:00,jqu81q,"That particular song was in response to the media treating her as if she was crazy. It doesn't necessarily devalue the idea that you relate to it. You probably relate to certain pieces of the song, and there are probably elements of truth in those pieces. 

There are a lot of other Taylor Swift songs that someone with BPD can relate to. Out of the woods, exile, all too well, the 1, my tears ricochet - and especially mirrorball

But there's so many more of them. Don't feel deceived just because one of those songs was a charicature of the media's blown out of proportion narrative. You can probably relate to that too. Don't you ever feel like other people come up with ideas about who you are but miss the important parts?"
2464,2020-11-09 15:51:15,jqu81q,"taylor‚Äôs a gifted songwriter, and she writes her satirical songs with sprigs of truth in them. i would say blank space isn‚Äôt satirical as more it is exaggerated. i think the troll part of the song is just the concept that she is a serial dater and treating men like shiny toys. lines like ‚Äúi‚Äôve got a blank space baby, and i‚Äôll write your name‚Äù and ‚Äúyou look like my next mistake‚Äùare apart of this concept that men are just knotches in her bedpost or a name in her book, so she has inspiration for her songs.. bc the media portrays her to be that way back in 2014.

then there are lines such as, ‚Äúyou know i love the player, and you love the game‚Äù and ‚Äúboys only want love if it‚Äôs torture‚Äù isn‚Äôt really meant to be her trolling. those lines specifically she has said in interviews as her relating to. she says in an interview, ‚ÄúI was thinking about this. Boys only want love if it‚Äôs torture and a constant chase. Men want love if it‚Äôs real, right, healthy and consistent.‚Äù

therefore, i kind of think this song is more about people generalizing and calling her crazy, when in reality, she‚Äôs just going on dates with guys and trying to her best to find love. i think it‚Äôs a total BPD anthem, bc many people just think we‚Äôre these people who are just trying to cause chaos, when in reality, we‚Äôre just trying our best to find and accept real love."

2499,2020-11-09 07:17:44,jqrqml,"Actually Folklore probably had such high numbers BECAUSE it was dropped the same day of. ariana wouldve likely seen higher number than these had she dropped the same day she tweeted her album was coming.


that being said, these numbers arent bad at all. anti by rihanna debuted w 166k and that was a huge album. And 100k-300k has always been where ariana falls when it comes to album sales. like rihanna, shes known to the public more for her hit singles and personality. not really concerned about it, and it feels like she is starting to step out the box at her own pace. my hair and love language are clear indications that shes growing and not stalled creatively like many reviews try to say."
2500,2020-11-09 13:09:52,jqrqml,"firstly, she still got a #1. that's huge and congrats to her. 

there are a few factors behind the low sales. i think the two most important ones are the new billboard rules and the timing of the drop. 

the new rules don't count merch or tour ticket bundling, and physical copies count the week they're shipped rather than the week they're sold. this is especially impactful for vinyls, as those sell a lot but they take forever to manufacture. with the new rules, taylor's folklore drop isn't doable any more (tons of merch bundles, 16 different physical versions, selling vinyls that aren't made yet and won't ship for 3 months). ari didn't even do preorders, positions had 7 physical versions and one lot of signed CDs that sold out in under an hour. i think if she'd had preorders and vinyls ready, numbers would have been higher.

in terms of timing, i think the election definitely played a role. i'm not american but multiple americans on popheads mentioned listening to very little music last week because they were just tuned into CNN 24/7. i'd be curious to know the impact of the election on listening as a whole, maybe spotify will release numbers. 

other factors are the minimal promo (some social media stuff and one zach sang interview), the lack of pop banger lead single, and the style being different from tun. she's also always been quite low with pure sales.

that said, i think it's fairly clear that she wanted a low-key era. she chose the timing, she clearly wasn't aiming for another culturally impactful moment like tun releasing the weekend before the election. there's a lot more promo and sales stuff she could have done but didn't. i interpret that as her not being too bothered about making this a huge moment, and a continuation of her just release music when she wants to vibe."
2501,2020-11-09 11:24:29,jqrqml,I think her life being ‚Äúnormal‚Äù right now has a lot to do with it to. Taylor dropped that album and everyone knew there would def be references to scooter and the label stuff. Sweetener and tun happened after really big events in aris life. Right now she‚Äôs in a good ‚Äúuneventful‚Äù time in her life so she‚Äôs probably not as interesting to random people if that makes sense. But positions hands down is one of my fav albums
2502,2020-11-09 20:41:53,jqrqml,"i mean, sales are dead but positions was handled terribly. the fact that it got leaked was bad, the album cover was lazy and the album as a whole was lacking in quality, sorry. i know it‚Äôs covid but the promo was horrible too. she could have done something more like idk, a livestream."
2503,2020-11-09 05:38:39,jqrqml,Bundles rule
2504,2020-11-09 05:37:07,jqrqml,"it is interesting. i personally loved the album as well (it‚Äôs my favorite one overall!), but I think the GP was probably expecting something on the same level as TUN. i assume because it was so iconic and even people who weren‚Äôt ariana grande fans had heard about it. that being said i‚Äôm so glad she went with her heart and made an album like this instead of playing it safe"
2505,2020-11-09 08:44:59,jqrqml,"Bundles such as signed cd's and any other additional items Included in the album total sales such as the alternative album covers were not included in the total sales. Positions has the highest one-week total for an album since bundles stopped factoring into chart and sales rankings. however, the new bundle rule came into place last month and not many huge artists on Ariana's level have released since then so that's not saying much lol. 

I do think the reasoning for low sales is becaue she played it very safe. The production and lyrics in tun were very impressive, however for positions they were mediocre and no songs really had a wow factor like most did in tun. 

Also the album leaked 4 days before the release date and almost everyone had already listened to the album and that would have had a big effect on the total sales.

Also it's worth noting positions had more first week streams that all her other albums bar tun (obviously lol). I believe we are in the streaming era and more people are streaming on platforms like Spotify and apple music rather than actually buying an album. Ariana is definitely a streaming artist and not an album seller. This could also be down to the fact the majority of her fans are from the current generation. Someone like Adele would have big pure album sales but maybe not as high pure streaming sales becaue her fans are from the older generation."
2506,2020-11-09 12:41:48,jqrqml,She should have prepped tons of bundles like signed CDs or even vinyl etc
2507,2020-11-09 15:50:38,jqrqml,"The pure sales is obvious. 

Streaming wise, I‚Äôd say a combo of the lead single not immediately sticking the landing for *a lot* of people, plus - that‚Äôs right - the whole thing leaked almost a week in advance, and *a lot* of people listened to it. 

I‚Äôm tempted to say over saturation played a role too, but her tweet got over a million likes, almost a million retweets etc. Seems to me like enough people didn‚Äôt care for the lead and skipped the album altogether. 

Who knowssssss exactly why tho"
2508,2020-11-09 05:46:52,jqrqml,I blame Scooter
2509,2020-11-09 07:27:41,jqrqml,"You're right. I think both worked as promo tactics. Ari using two weeks and a single as promo, Taylor using dropping the album in less than a day as promo. Each of them did their part of doing promo. But the success of their projects varied drastically. 

Hmm, but compared to Ari's past albums, she sold 300k for TUN and 200k for Swt. 100k is a big difference from 300k. It's practically half of what her last album did. She's lower than DW numbers back in 2016 when she's at the top of the game now. 100k to 300k is a huge range. 

I agree that My Hair is jazzy and unlike what she's done before. I enjoyed that. Yet the fact that most reviews feel like she's playing safe does indicate that she hasn't progressed much creatively. 

To me, I think progress is overrated. I dont mind if she dabbles the same genres over and over again as long as the music continues to sound good. I don't care much for evolution as long as the quality stays, but I guess the GP does."
2510,2020-12-11 10:17:49,jqrqml,"To be fair, Taylor's had big sales for years. She's always been more of an album artist, whereas Ariana is a singles artist"
2511,2020-11-09 11:38:04,jqrqml,"I absolutely agree. I think I've mentioned it before on other posts but it's sad that an artist's relevancy is tied to an extent to a tumultuous personal life. With a greater downfall comes greater highs and greater investment from the GP. 

I hate grief porn but I think a lot of the fanbase is guilty of that even though I know they don't have any ill intentions. I try my best not to indulge myself in that, which means I always ignore any possible references to Mac in her music. I don't care to know or discover it. I'd much rather let him rest in peace and enjoy her music for what it is."
2512,2020-11-09 20:50:56,jqrqml,"I‚Äôm sorry but reducing Taylor‚Äôs strength in album sales to just being about scooter and the label stuff seems extremely wrong. Especially folklore is a critically acclaimed album that took people by surprised and the fact that we didn‚Äôt even know she was referencing those things until we heard the album close enough (I certainly wasn‚Äôt expecting her to sing about it and also those things were referenced only in like 2 songs at best). The reason why Taylor has strong album sales AND streaming numbers wasn‚Äôt because people were interested in her personal life. She literally said folklore isn‚Äôt about her personal life (although you can make some connections about her personal life). Again, reducing Taylor‚Äôs hard work and taking a risk to switch from a pretty poppy album like reputation and lover to a more subdued album like folklore seems insulting. Of course maybe that‚Äôs not what you meant but the idea is; you make good music, people will listen to it, it doesn‚Äôt matter if some big event happened in the artist‚Äôs life or not."
2513,2020-11-09 05:45:00,jqrqml,Ariana did do signed CDs if I'm not wrong
2514,2020-11-09 05:42:09,jqrqml,"That's an interesting take. I agree that they expected TUN level of quality, and didn't get that. 

But the funny thing is, a lot of reviews say that she's playing it too safe in Positions. For example, I found this here:

https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/08/ariana-grande-positions-review"
2515,2020-11-09 08:53:36,jqrqml,"I see. That was an interesting and insightful take. I agree with many of your points. Thank you for sharing!!

(And omg I remember the leak now. That's probably one good reason.)"
2516,2020-11-09 15:51:39,jqrqml,Can‚Äôt do that anymore unless everything is ready to ship on release week.
2517,2020-11-09 15:54:16,jqrqml,"Yeah, you're right, I keep forgetting about the leaks. That played a part too, for sure. :(

Yeah, I went to popheads and a lot of people were confused how her Tweet announcing the album got a million likes but her album sales didn't exactly match that. Beats me too"
2518,2020-11-09 05:51:47,jqrqml,Why? Why do we have to blame her manager instead of holding the artist herself accountable to a degree? I don't want to blindly idolize someone to the point that I'd always push the blame to somebody else
2519,2020-11-09 15:08:37,jqrqml,"Hmm I think there were a whole bunch of reasons for one Taylor was able to use merch bundles before the rule came into effect that they wouldn‚Äôt count as sales, also the fact Ariana‚Äôs album leaked days before it dropped, then it being election week she wasn‚Äôt really posting much about it either, also I think if she had dropped another video to go with the album release that would‚Äôve helped alot, but I would say Ariana‚Äôs release was a lot more messy then Folklore‚Äôs release, for me the music was great but the rollout was awful and idk what Scooter was thinking with this..."
2520,2020-11-09 05:50:40,jqrqml,"ehh she didn‚Äôt even signed a lot, and taylor‚Äôs album dropped right before the rule was set there was a bunch of different versions of her album on release and ariana didn‚Äôt even have a preorder link for this album as well. Billboard also said this was the highest one week total since the bundles stopped, so this low number was expected for me."
2521,2020-11-09 05:55:32,jqrqml,"Imo she did play it safe. She made an album in which she slightly departed from her usual stuff but still managed to sound like a bunch of music that could have effortlessly fit in previous projects. It obviously wasn't bad, but even some of her most devoted fans can recognize that it wasn't something fresh"
2522,2020-11-09 05:45:31,jqrqml,ooh yeah I actually can see that point as well! I guess I assumed a more typical pop sound would be considered ‚Äúsafe‚Äù but reading that I definitely can see their point!
2523,2020-11-09 15:53:22,jqrqml,That was my point
2524,2020-11-09 08:23:30,jqrqml,Lol it's always when an artist does bad blame the management but when an artist does good all credit to the artist
2525,2020-11-09 05:56:30,jqrqml,"You may be right, but you're indicating that this lack of a merch bundle option accounted for about 200k worth of difference of sales compared to TUN, or 600k difference in sales from Folklore? Taylor had an edge with the merch bundles, yes, but Ari had two weeks of hype to build before the album release, and Taylor had less than a day. Ari also had a single out a week before.

While it might explain Ari's drop in sales, this huge decline cannot be attributed fully to that."
2526,2020-11-09 17:26:02,jqrqml,"Oof my bad, missed ‚Äúprepped.‚Äù Got you."
2527,2020-11-09 08:24:11,jqrqml,Agree lmao
2528,2020-11-09 06:01:34,jqrqml,"Your right on that one because many thought this would have been another thank u next, but obviously it wasn‚Äôt. But Taylor is one of those artists where she always does well when it comes to album sales, nothing like ariana so I wouldn‚Äôt use her as an example since she will always come on top."
2529,2020-11-09 12:59:20,jqrqml,"in all fairness, sales are literally her manager's job. blaming scooter for the music being crap is unfair, blaming scooter for the sales being low is more justified. as a whole though, people do demonise scooter a lot."
2530,2020-11-09 06:06:25,jqrqml,"Yes, it definitely wasn't TUN level. I agree with you.

Hmm, I believe that credit should be given when credit is due. Lover didn't do that well for Taylor's standards even though Taylor went ham with promoting it, but Folklore almost matched Lover in sales even though she barely did promo. Not even Taylor is infallible. If your album is good, it'll do well. That was the case for Folklore.

But Positions fell hard from TUN in terms of sales. If we're comparing Ari with her past works, it's not good either."
2531,2020-11-09 13:01:11,jqrqml,Sales can be low because music is crap though. I don't think Positions is crap (FAR FROM IT) but musical quality plays a massive role in sales.
2532,2020-11-09 06:11:47,jqrqml,"But it‚Äôs like why compare her old numbers when u can just enjoy what she got now üò≠, of course it‚Äôs not gonna do similar numbers if people don‚Äôt like it. At the end she‚Äôs still number 1 whether the numbers were high or low."
2533,2020-11-09 13:12:19,jqrqml,"oh yeah for sure, but imo sales have a lot more to do with promotion and strategy. a lot of crap albums have sold loads of copies because of a few good singles and strong marketing. i'm just saying this is one area where it's not entirely unreasonable to assign some responsibility to her manager."
2534,2020-11-09 06:15:56,jqrqml,"Hmm, because I am interested in what the GP thinks of her works. As a fan I'm super biased towards her stuff so I always find it great, but I don't want to just stay in my biased bubble. I want to hear perspectives that might clash with my own. It helps me look at her works with new perspectives and thoughts"
2535,2020-11-09 13:34:12,jqrqml,"I think Scooter would have wanted Ari to do more promo, but she probably didn't want to. She's much less invested in charts than he is, or has at least indicated so during interviews. I don't think we should really point fingers at him because an artist as big as Ari probably has her own agency that he can't do much about."

2556,2020-12-16 13:13:12,kdnkau,Taylor Swift sunbaenim is doing well
2557,2020-12-18 04:19:49,kdnkau,I love Taylor Swift and seeing her in this list next to so many kpop groups makes me laugh so bad
2558,2020-12-18 04:26:23,kdnkau,StayC with the sleeper hit
2559,2020-12-18 04:15:03,kdnkau,Man IZ*ONE has been killing it! So proud of them
2560,2020-12-18 23:27:31,kdnkau,"I am not sure why Taylor is on that list, but I'll accept it anyways because I'm not a jerk."
2561,2020-12-18 04:44:29,kdnkau,Mago still at number two because it's such a great song! I've been listening to walpurgis night so much I think it's time I finally stan gfriend
2562,2020-12-15 16:50:19,kdnhsd,"I actually somewhat disagree in that TS fans are not as young as you may expect. She‚Äôs been around for over a decade now and a lot of people who started listening to her music as teenagers are in their late 20s now. I‚Äôm personally in my 20s now as well and started listening to TS in middle school, then The National a couple years later in high school. If I had to guess, I think in recent years Swift‚Äôs music has matured to appeal to an older crowd in general therefore I don‚Äôt think quite as many young (under 20) fans are hopping on the TS bandwagon now. I think most of her fans have grown up with her and the music she makes now caters to that!"
2563,2020-12-15 20:11:55,kdnhsd,"I'm of the T Swift age, but my childhood must have taken its toll, cause at age 15 I was lying on my floor listening to high Violet and Cherry Tree not White Horse. Can a teen girl be a depressed dad?"
2564,2020-12-15 15:39:27,kdnhsd,"Good for them! Wish I could hear all these songs for the first time, too!

Even better is that The National, due to their collaborative nature, are a great gateway to awesome musicians."
2565,2020-12-15 17:50:40,kdnhsd,[removed]
2566,2020-12-17 00:22:35,kdnhsd,"I‚Äôm the same age as Taylor Swift but only got into her music last year. Now a huge fan. Been a fan of The National for a little over a decade now. I definitely think Taylor‚Äôs fan base is probably close to my age but there‚Äôs no denying some younger fans are a huge part of it. I‚Äôm not sure what the average National fan is. When I see them live, it‚Äôs a big mix of ages, but it skews probably to around my age already honestly."
2567,2020-12-15 16:53:21,kdnhsd,Yeah that's my point.  If the National appealed to an older crowd 10 years ago..say those folx were 30ish when they started. They're now 40... Swift fans are now 25 getting into her matured music and it overlaps with the already matured National catalog.
2568,2020-12-15 21:00:28,kdnhsd,I‚Äôm a bit younger than Taylor but I loved the national growing up (High Violet was my desktop background when I was 15) and didn‚Äôt get into Taylor until I was later in college. There are more of us than you think!
2569,2020-12-16 00:32:40,kdnhsd,"Yes, yes you can lol"
2570,2020-12-17 21:53:31,kdnhsd,Ah great I found my alt. Didn't get into Swift until well after my sad dad teenage midlife crisis lol
2571,2021-01-08 23:24:08,kdnhsd,"I'm slightly younger than her, turning 28 later this month, and at 15 I was basically a depressed, divorced dad going through a midlife crisis. Boxer and High Violet spoke to me. Also Radiohead stuff. So much Radiohead stuff.  I got into TS in my last year of college and absolutely loved her last four albums."
2572,2020-12-16 05:31:56,kdnhsd,"Definitely! I discovered The National during an episode of Gossip Girl like 10 years ago. While not the normal demographic, if wasn‚Äôt for that, Boxer would have never saved my life."
2573,2020-12-15 19:28:29,kdnhsd,I‚Äôm 45 been a national fan since 2000 and a TS fan since never lol
2574,2020-12-15 15:58:08,kdnfnx,"Just goes to show how much of a crap-shoot the draft is. Also, context is important when looking back at these..

In 2016, A‚ÄôShawn Robinson was a popular mock draft pick to the Lions in the 1st round, so many people were happy to see him fall to them in the 2nd.  Obviously we would have loved to get a Michael Thomas level player on the team, but at the time, ARob seemed like a steal. 

Also, 2016 was the year that Marvin Jones Jr signed with Detroit to replace newly-retired Calvin Johnson to pair with Golden Tate. Not sure that MT would have been viewed as a necessary addition, given the large contracts already devoted to the WR room."
2575,2020-12-15 16:45:46,kdnfnx,Still pissed we cut huntley our 5th round pick. What a waste
2576,2020-12-15 16:19:00,kdnfnx,"This is good data but requires some additional analysis. I'd like to compare it to similar data of winning and losing GMs. Also some grading on players other than binary Pro Bowl/ not Pro bowl.

Similar to other lists mark each player as:

Out of league or practice squad

On roster

Starter

Pro bowler+


Maybe it's just me but I don't know every player every drafted and their current situation. So outside of big names it's hard to get information on a lot of these picks.


The only thing I can get from this data is the draft is a crapshoot which we already know. Like I said good data but might have to go a few steps further to actually use this to grade him. Remember every player we ""passed"" on so did all the teams that selected ahead of us. 


I'm bored at work I might steal your table and get to work on additional data collection."
2577,2020-12-15 16:24:03,kdnfnx,"Jamal Agnew was 1st team all-pro as a rookie, might want to add that to the chart"
2578,2020-12-15 15:22:57,kdnfnx,A big question I‚Äôll have going forward will be who the better pick was between Swift and Taylor. Right now it‚Äôs looking like Swift will be the better back but I could easily see Jonathan Taylor picking up steam if Indi can figure out how their running game
2579,2020-12-15 19:16:54,kdnfnx,"Bob Quinn‚Äôs drafting was pretty bad, but what really made his performance unacceptable were his free agency signings. He missed on almost all of the big money signings"
2580,2020-12-15 17:30:06,kdnfnx,"I would actually be curious to see how bad our luck has been for taken right before us... just the first round the last two years, we missed on Josh Allen to Jacksonville and Chase Young to Washington"
2581,2020-12-15 15:44:20,kdnfnx,Bob quinn was way too inconsistent. He would either make a good pick or a bad. No in between
2582,2020-12-15 18:07:39,kdnfnx,TL;DR: He was bad at drafting
2583,2020-12-15 20:55:14,kdnfnx,"I'd love to see something like this, but instead of ""next pick"" or ""next pick at same position"" I would just see who would have been picked if you had gone ""BPA"" based on pre-draft rankings."
2584,2020-12-15 22:31:35,kdnfnx,"There are a couple stand out bad picks (tabor and tavai) but most of he‚Äôs drafting was decent.  Do the same analysis for every team, there‚Äôs always some misses.  Tavai and tabor were inexcusable ‚Äúsmartest man in the room‚Äù millenesq moves, but there were some good picks as well in there.

My biggest knock on Quinn was the the roster moves, the talent lost in sacrifice for ‚Äúsystem‚Äù guys."
2585,2020-12-16 02:07:49,kdnfnx,Listen I don't want to be that guy but the next CB taken off the board after okudah in 2020 was Henderson
2586,2020-12-16 02:10:18,kdnfnx,In conclusion Quinn either drafted a blocker a catcher or a bust
2587,2020-12-16 01:25:11,kdnfnx,"Also the Decker pick. Keanu Neal was the next pick and did make a probowl. However, since then he has not been able to stay healthy at all and Decker has quietly become one of the better LTs around. Context is everything here."
2588,2020-12-16 06:24:30,kdnfnx,"I remember a lot of people were excited about Teez Tabor in round 2 as well myself included. Guy was rated a top corner throughout most of the draft process, his 40 killed his stock and unfortunately his career."
2589,2020-12-15 19:53:46,kdnfnx,"BQ heard, ‚Äúspeed kills‚Äù and didn‚Äôt want Huntley harming anybody on the team."
2590,2020-12-16 04:04:52,kdnfnx,"Quinn had a way of cutting 5th/6th round picks before the season even started. I get avoiding the sunk cost fallacy, but it happened more often than it should have."
2591,2020-12-15 16:45:50,kdnfnx,"100% agree, please steal the table and do a deeper analysis, I didn't have to time to!"
2592,2020-12-15 15:39:40,kdnfnx,"Running backs are usually so offensive-line dependent, though, that it's hard to really know for sure."
2593,2020-12-15 15:57:17,kdnfnx,"Frankly I don't think the distinction between these two is all that important. Both seem to be starters, maybe even pro-bowlers, but RB is frankly not an impact position unless the back is either a transcendental talent or really really bad at following blocks.  


OL and scheme are far more impactful in the running game."
2594,2020-12-15 18:56:06,kdnfnx,Josh Allen had me big sad. I didn't think Jacksonville was going to pick him. I figured they would draft more help on the oline.
2595,2020-12-15 16:48:18,kdnfnx,"I mean i think there were quite a few OK picks:

A'Shawn Robinson, Miles Killebrew, Dwayne Washington, Reeves-Maybin, Austin Bryant, Ty Johnson, all see OK to me.

My bigger issue is 2 Pro Bowlers in 4 drafts, 1 of which was a kick returner."
2596,2020-12-15 22:33:45,kdnfnx,"I don‚Äôt think bad is a fair assessment, average is more accurate.  Look at everyone else‚Äôs draft, there‚Äôs hits and misses.  Crucify Quinn for the players he got rid of to fit Matty Patties ‚Äúsystem‚Äù"
2597,2020-12-15 23:26:45,kdnfnx,"Feel free to use this table as a starting point! I dont think I can put more time into it right now, I'd love to see that as well"
2598,2020-12-16 02:55:39,kdnfnx,Whoops typo sorry about that.
2599,2020-12-16 01:26:11,kdnfnx,Yeah that one made no sense.
2600,2020-12-15 16:52:18,kdnfnx,Pro bowlers dont really mean much. Hes drafted some really good players but they wont be pro bowlers becuase they play for the lions
2601,2020-12-15 15:25:56,kdncu3,That‚Äôs pretty wholesome. I like their friendship.
2602,2020-12-15 16:02:29,kdncu3,And Paul would‚Äôve been releasing it on the 50 th anniversary of John Lennon‚Äôs first album Plastic Ono Band
2603,2020-12-15 15:15:43,kdncu3,u/EP9 predicted it
2604,2020-12-15 21:38:23,kdncu3,Are we all just ignoring that she wasn‚Äôt 100% on when her birthday was?
2605,2020-12-15 18:23:55,kdncu3,"I was unaware of the interview, just listening to it now, a real treat!"
2606,2020-12-16 14:25:01,kdncu3,The only thing I got out of this is that Paul knew about evermore and didn't tell us
2607,2020-12-15 15:34:24,kdncu3,"Me too! I think it's really kind of her to ask Paul directly, and shows just how much respect she has for him, and vice versa"
2608,2020-12-15 16:10:37,kdncu3,I'm sure John doesn't have anything to say about that
2609,2020-12-15 16:18:11,kdncu3,"Holy shit no way, it was a total shower thought too!"
2610,2020-12-15 23:32:48,kdncu3,"the words in quotes are paul quoting what taylor said. The part that mentions thinking its the 10th is paul talking, so paul is unsure when her birthday is"
2611,2020-12-16 14:29:38,kdncu3,"I acknowledged in the edit that I misunderstood Paul's wording and that he didn't move the dates, Taylor did"
2612,2020-12-15 15:40:47,kdncu3,"Part of me wonders if they did that Rolling Stone cover together to show solidarity, and that there‚Äôs no bad vibes between them. 

I‚Äôm not really into her music but yes I love that she obviously really likes and respects him! It‚Äôs not new either, she‚Äôs talked about him as an inspiration for a while now."
2613,2020-12-16 05:39:00,kdncu3,I‚Äôve been shot
2614,2020-12-15 16:18:52,kdncu3,Why would there be bad vibes?
2615,2020-12-15 19:11:38,kdncu3,"I know Paul listened to *folklore* in that meeting (and Taylor listened to *McCartney III*), but I wonder if she played him a few tunes from *evermore*."
2616,2020-12-16 02:28:48,kdncu3,"As long as she didn't get Ringo to hand deliver the letter, I don't think there's much chance of bad vibes."
2617,2020-12-15 16:19:53,kdncu3,"Like they were in competition for number one or whatever, or Paul was upset that he had to move his release date? Idk. People invent these kinds of stories all the time."
2618,2020-12-15 16:20:31,kdncu3,"Different markets, but also, we know whose number 1"
2619,2020-12-15 16:27:19,kdncu3,Paul always number one in my heart (if not the charts!)

2659,2020-12-30 15:43:52,kn2lep,"From experience, AM isn't very good at recommending me my taste in music. I never listen to Pop, but I'm getting the same type of artists recommended to me.

People are saying to keep liking/disliking tracks, but it doesn't seem to drastically improve the algorithm."
2660,2020-12-30 15:47:25,kn2lep,"in addition to loving/disliking, i would suggest adding things to your library. i listen to a mix of english/french/japanese and AM is pretty good about recommending a mix of all three to me."
2661,2020-12-31 12:37:02,kn2lep,"From my experience, AM‚Äôs algorithm is like the slow kid in class. It‚Äôll reach the point where it understands your taste, but it‚Äôs that... slow. I‚Äôm mainly a rock/punk listener (although I do listen to random stuff from other genres) and at first I had the same issue as you, as I would get recommendations from reggeaton, pop, country and maybe 1 or 2 rock songs (that I may or may not like). After ~4 months it did start to pick my tastes and now (5, almost 6 months) most of my recommended songs are rock and I usually do like most of them. 

YMMV, as I wasn‚Äôt that active on the dislike/like features (although I did my fair bit), so it may pick up its pace with you faster than it did with me.

I also feel like it‚Äôs maybe a bit lazy? As said, almost everything that I get on recommended is rock, even if I sometimes I do listen to other genres, so while I wouldn‚Äôt want to get spammed again with pop, maybe 1 or 2 interesting songs would be nice"
2662,2020-12-30 15:44:18,kn2ccb,I‚Äôm part of the quiet minority that has Fleet Foxes as my AOTY and I am glad to see it up there! Definitely thought Perfume Genius would jump it
2663,2020-12-30 13:44:21,kn2ccb,Amazing how close the top two were in the end wow
2664,2020-12-30 14:37:33,kn2ccb,"I consider myself very plugged into this sub and am pretty shocked to see certain albums so low (Khruangbin? Lomelda??) and other albums that I literally have never seen mentioned here once so high (Ichiko Aoba? Klo Pelgag? Oranssi Pazuzu? Tkay Maizda?)

Guess it just means I have some listening to do..

Oh and Cindy Lee got snubbed big time!"
2665,2020-12-30 14:07:43,kn2ccb,I had some predictions that The New Abnormal was a candidate for number three but I didn't think it would be there so decisively.  Surprising to see the gap from 4 to 5.
2666,2020-12-30 15:51:38,kn2ccb,Kind of cool that What's Your Pleasure? and Women in Music Pt. III got the same exact amount of points given that they were released on the same day
2667,2020-12-30 14:48:03,kn2ccb,How is Yves not in top 10? That one is a surprise
2668,2020-12-30 14:47:22,kn2ccb,Which Sault album? It just says Untitled
2669,2020-12-30 13:39:28,kn2ccb,impressive to make the top 10 after coming out only three days before the voting thread
2670,2020-12-30 13:50:36,kn2ccb,"Wow Punisher and FtBC ended up being really close! Interesting. No real surprises here though

Edit: Actually it's crazy to me that Thundercat and Christian Lee Hutson didn't make the top 100. I thought those two were pretty well liked around here!"
2671,2020-12-30 15:35:18,kn2ccb,Glad to see Ichiko Aoba continues her trend of wonderful last-minute December releases that just wreck all preconceived AOTY lists
2672,2020-12-30 15:50:19,kn2ccb,That Nation of Language album is fantastic.
2673,2020-12-30 15:04:06,kn2ccb,"I think if color theory had come out in August or later, this ranking would look very different. The album sonically fit the rest of 2020 better and I think it sunk lower on lists because it was released so early. Still in my top three of the year."
2674,2020-12-30 15:20:20,kn2ccb,"I'm a little surprised to see that Glass Animals album so high considering its reception here, same with the new CSH and maybe the King Gizz record

I wish I could witness the new Wolf Parade record here but I think I forgot to vote for it myself so I don't get to complain"
2675,2020-12-30 15:17:32,kn2ccb,Nice to see Frances Quinlan crack the top 50. I had that album on repeat for a while.

Mildly surprised that Open Mike Eagle didn't do better, especially in comparison to other hip hop albums on the list."

* we love to see the Microphones in both AOTY and SOTY for the same piece of music
* the real fun is going to the bottom of that 800+ line spreadsheet and seeing what albums only a small gaggle voted for.  I was I think the *only* motherfucker to vote for McCraven/Scott-Heron's *We're New Again* or the new Fennec album
* somebody tried to vote for ""take impala"" lmao

2681,2020-12-30 14:55:50,kn2ccb,Maybe I need to be need to be more annoying about Nnamd√Ø. Everyone is just afraid of his ability to rap AND make emo math-rock as well as do basically everything in his power to give back to his scene and community.
2682,2020-12-30 14:24:53,kn2ccb,"Chuffed for Waxahatchee to get a top 10 finish; well deserved. My AotY.

Also pleased for Spanish Love Songs getting a place here - thought they might have flown under the radar releasing so early in the year (before you-know-what happened)."

Seriously though, the real fun is at the bottom of that spreadsheet. Some real wild stuff in there and a load of artists I didn't even know had stuff released this year."
2687,2020-12-30 14:16:51,kn2ccb,"Positives: fabulous top two, and I‚Äôm so impressed the Avalanches were able to make top ten (I wonder if they could pull off the unprecedented and get top 10 again next year, as a December release?)

Less positives: Yves Tumor released one of the year‚Äôs very best albums; 14 is still good, but I was hoping for higher. R√≥is√≠n too. And seeing Perfume Genius at #5 makes me keen for another five album Rate

This was fun though - thanks for organizing everything!"
2688,2020-12-30 14:30:48,kn2ccb,Moses Sumney is lower than I expected. Gr√¶ is a stellar piece of music. And Roisin Murphy deserves better too.

2690,2020-12-30 16:05:07,kn2ccb,"Super glad to see Nation of Language make the list.

It's a great album that deserves more attention but I haven't seen it on any other lists."
2691,2020-12-30 17:44:47,kn2ccb,"Thank you viper <3 

Madlo seems kinda low so I might do a recount"
2692,2020-12-30 15:17:47,kn2ccb,Phoebe Bridgers seriously just scored the same as the year she was born.
2693,2020-12-30 19:04:13,kn2ccb,Andy Shauf at 32 and Bonny Light Horseman at 72? I'll take it.
2694,2020-12-30 15:15:09,kn2ccb,"Glad to see After Hours is at least on there. I don't get why Fantano, Pitchfork, the Grammys, everyone collectively snubbed the Weeknd when After Hours is simply a non-stop pop ecstasy from start to finish. On a strictly personal level, I found it as entertaining, though granted not as original, as anything Michael Jackson ever put out and I hate to see it ignored almost across the board. No, it is by no means any kind of ""grand musical statement"", but sometimes things don't have to be, sometimes it's okay for an album to just be hella' solid craftsmanship and After Hours really was that."
2695,2020-12-30 15:45:39,kn2ccb,"Finally, a list that will appease the subs Strokes fans!

I somehow always miss the polls but I'm glad to see STRFKR, IH, and that excellent Hum album all make the list."
2696,2020-12-30 15:22:17,kn2ccb,"Hum's Inlet has been my jam, I knew it wouldn't be a massive hit but I'm glad to see it get a little love here."
2697,2020-12-30 14:43:17,kn2ccb,Funny coincidence. Phoebe got exactly as many votes as the year when she was born. 1994.
2698,2020-12-30 15:52:03,kn2ccb,"As someone who got into The 1975 after Notes came out this year, I'm stoked to see it on this list. I know a lot of fans don't like the album, and I'm not sure how I would have felt about it if I was an early fan, but I really love it. I always skip the first two tracks, because they don't at all fit on this album in any way (and also I'm not sure who would want to listen to the Greta track over and over), but after that I can put it on from beginning to end, it's a really great vibe.

It's certainly not as tight of an album as it could have been. I would have cut the first two tracks, Shiny Collarbone, Having No Head, Bagsy not in Net, and maybe Yeah I Know. But I still find those songs enjoyable and never skip them.

I'm sure it didn't help already existing fans that a bunch of the highlights were put out months before as singles, but for someone who just heard the whole thing at once, it was one of my most played albums this year! I'd still rank it behind their second and third album, though."

Disappointed to not see HEALTHs new collab album on here. Solo track and Tracks with Brothel and Soccer Mommy are def in the running for SOTY imo.

Edit: Holy Smokes. Went in wanting to be the contrarian. Just gave it a proper headphones listen, and Jesus it‚Äôs a beautiful album. For everything I‚Äôve seen here, yes, cool music / voice. This album is so well produced and mixed. That‚Äôs what stands out to me.

Double Edit: I want a Punch Brothers collab"
2704,2020-12-30 16:16:15,kn2ccb,Yayyyyy did not expect Charli to be so high. I didn't know this sub loved her so much.

Were these counted? And if yes, why are they listed again all the way down there?

Even if we're only counting #219 and disregarding the ones with the ""instrumentals"" mix up, the 17  additional points she received from #219 would lift her over Charli XCX on #6."

2715,2020-12-30 14:08:46,kn2ccb,The New Abnormal the best rock album deserve this place.
2716,2020-12-30 16:39:12,kn2ccb,"I thoroughly listened to and enjoyed about 19 albums on this list, including half of the top 10. (Which makes me proud, because it means I explored!) 

I would put Bombay Bicycle Club and The Killers higher, I wasn't toooo fond about the Fiona Apple album but it might require more listens, and Phoebe and the Strokes have single handedly defined 2020 for me with their albums."
2717,2020-12-30 23:01:55,kn2ccb,"Was this a weak year for ‚Äútraditional indie rock‚Äù?

Actually, maybe that music isn‚Äôt being made as much anymore. Remembering when albums from Arcade Fire, Broken Social Scene, Radiohead, Grizzly Bear etc. topped these lists. 

Any 2020 recommendations that are more in line with the bands I listed above?

I just realized I‚Äôve been listening to mostly girl folk/rock."

2720,2020-12-30 19:03:22,kn2ccb,Yay Caroline Rose! Her album was my favorite this year and I didn‚Äôt actually expect it to make it onto this list. Just really great pop music

2723,2021-01-01 11:17:47,kn2ccb,"In my personal, I‚Äôd also include the Cloud Nothings album they released through Bandcamp, and I really enjoyed the latest This Will Destroy You album. Jeff Tweedy made a beautiful album too, surprised not to see on this list. And hell I also liked the Machine Gun Kelly pop-punk album and the green day side project thing, The Network!"

2727,2020-12-30 15:15:53,kn2ccb,Do both SAULT albums have been aggregated?
2728,2020-12-30 15:44:01,kn2ccb,Bartees Strange is waaaaay too low.
2729,2020-12-30 16:36:34,kn2ccb,Did people really not like Four Tet's Sixteen Oceans? How that can't be in the top 100 seems crazy to me.
2730,2020-12-30 15:55:10,kn2ccb,Wish more people would listen to Nick Shoulders. ‚ÄòRather Low‚Äô is an incredible song and the album follows suit.
2731,2020-12-30 16:34:31,kn2ccb,Now this is a good list.  Well done Indieheads

2738,2020-12-31 00:14:59,kn2ccb,"It's a shame that Special Interests's *The Passion Of* didn't make the list but I suppose it's more punk leaning than 99% of these albums. It was extremely refreshing with good, danceable beats and intense, sharp lyrics. 

Good to see *Purple Moonlight Pages* up there though. I found that album at just the right time and it's lyrics connected with me hard. I think of the line ""I cook all day and call that luxury"" at least once a day.

Nice to know that Beach Bunny's *Honeymoon* has stayed on some people's radar. Still a catchy, joyful listen.

Fontaines DC still hasn't really connected with me outside of a few songs. All of the talk about their lyrics being poetic doesn't hold much water for me, it just feels like a result of them talking about being influenced by Shane McGowan and the Pogues so much."
2739,2020-12-31 02:04:21,kn2ccb,Not a bad list. I thought My Morning Jacket - The Waterfall II was pretty strong personally. Should be in the top 50.
2740,2020-12-31 02:30:00,kn2ccb,"Welp, only 4 of my picks didn't make it. Peach Pit was only 4 points away from cracking the list! So sad, that was such a delightful summer album. Also can't believe me and a couple other people were the only ones to vote on Hazel English and Cults, both those albums are so well-written and catchy.

But the biggest surprise is I was the ONLY person who voted for Madeline Kenney ""Sucker's Lunch"", y'all are SLEEPING on this one. It's a wonderfully melancholy album. Definitely check it out if you're a fan of Wye Oak, they produced the record and it has some stylistic similarities."
2741,2020-12-31 03:40:08,kn2ccb,"I'm so glad to see how popular Microphones in 2020 was, it didn't feel like there was a lot of hype for it when it came out but it was one of my favorite releases of the year."

2805,2020-12-30 21:16:41,kn2ccb,"it's honestly made it's way up to being my favorite strokes album. 

it's got the incredible songwriting of the first two albums, but the tracks all sound distinct and different from each other. i love is this it and room on fire but i do agree with the criticism that all the songs sound kind of the same. they have their standout tracks, but the rest of the albums just kind of blends together if you're not paying close attention.  none of the songs on this album sound like one another, and they're all quality songs if you ask me. the only song i don't love is bad decisions, but it's still a very fun track. better than most of the stuff on comedown machine and first impressions of earth imo. 

plus the adults are talking, at the door, and ode to the mets have all creeped their way into my top ten favorite strokes songs. i consider all of those songs to be essential strokes songs which is surprising since i didn't think they could make another song of that quality since angles. at the door might be their most beautiful song, only second to hard to explain. 

it's some seriously amazing stuff for a strokes fan."
2806,2020-12-30 22:27:45,kn2ccb,Wasn't here for voting but it was my number 1 tbh. The New Abnormal has been my comfort album this year

2808,2020-12-30 15:34:49,kn2ccb,"I honestly thought that album was kind of a meme... didn't think people ACTUALLY held it to such high regards. I'm not sure why myself, I think it's an okay album, but probably one I'll forget a few months into 2021."
2809,2020-12-30 23:17:10,kn2ccb,And they're both essentially perfect in their own genre

2811,2020-12-30 14:56:16,kn2ccb,too many people failed to specify so we just put untitled
2812,2020-12-30 14:59:53,kn2ccb,Yeah to build off what rose said.  We had over 200 votes for 'untitled' and around a dozen for each album individually.  So we felt combing them would be the most fair way to handle it.
2813,2020-12-30 15:01:18,kn2ccb,Yeah i was confused about that lol did they combine black is and rise into one with the votes?
2814,2020-12-30 16:17:53,kn2ccb,"I put it on my list, but I‚Äôm thinking it would probably be my number 1 now if I redid it. Was just kind of hard to justify after only a few listens."

2816,2020-12-30 13:43:39,kn2ccb,"I wasn't a big fan of the new avalanches, so part of me thinks it's because people were still actively listening to it, and that gave it an advantage.  But either way it's really interesting to see such a new album place so high."

2818,2020-12-30 18:51:10,kn2ccb,Extremely impressive. I was shocked to see it so high. I wonder where it would have placed with a few weeks under its belt.
2819,2020-12-30 19:40:57,kn2ccb,"I've always thought that of Thundercat made a jazz/psychedelia album without so much of his signature vocals, it'd be incredible. He's such a great bass player but his vocals always just sound goofy to me. I like his music but I feel like I'd love it if he did something like that."
2820,2020-12-30 17:33:28,kn2ccb,"I only listened to it this week but yeah, given more time to settle it may well have cracked my top 10."
2821,2020-12-30 17:20:15,kn2ccb,"By far my favorite album of the year. After getting a single here and there for so long, I'm glad to see them have a larger audience. I'm so mad, I had plans to try and catch a show this year."
2822,2020-12-30 15:10:13,kn2ccb,"Yeah, Soccer Mommy was robbed. 

I think you're right that albums released later have a greater chance of remaining in the spotlight and doing better on these kinds of lists."
2823,2020-12-30 23:21:50,kn2ccb,"yeah, circle the drain made it onto a lot of year-end lists but i definitely think the album itself is punisher-level type of good"
2824,2020-12-30 16:04:04,kn2ccb,"Wait, I'm not the only person who heard the Wokf Parade album?? THERE ARE OTHERS????"
2825,2020-12-30 17:48:10,kn2ccb,"Definitely their weakest, but there are still some really good songs on there. Heat Waves was a great summer song imo"
2826,2020-12-30 19:06:05,kn2ccb,"Right? I'm a huge Car Seat fan, and I can't imagine anyone thinking MADLO was an excellent album, especially in the context of all of their previous work. There are a few solid songs that I still listen to, like Life Worth Missing, There Must Be More Than Blood, and Can't Cool Me Down (although still in the camp that this album version is inferior to their live renditions with Naked Giants), but this album should not be a contender. It's surprising to see albums like Lomelda's or Dehd's below it in ranking."
2827,2020-12-30 19:22:08,kn2ccb,"""I wish I could witness the new Wolf Parade record here but I think I forgot to vote for it myself so I don't get to complain""

2828,2020-12-31 07:50:14,kn2ccb,"I know indieheads has unusual taste but I seriously question people's judgement if Brave Faces Everyone, Peaceful as Hell, and even the Taylor and Joji records are worse than Dreamland. Dreamland was seriously underwhelming and even grating on a couple tracks. Same with MADLO and I actually liked that album a lot."
2829,2020-12-30 16:54:44,kn2ccb,"I agree about Glass Animals, I thought it was their weakest album yet and it's wild to see some of the albums that were ranked below it."
2830,2020-12-30 15:46:15,kn2ccb,I'm just now getting into it but I'm really enjoying it.
2831,2020-12-30 13:52:58,kn2ccb,Yeah that‚Äôs nonsense. First work I ever picked up by Phoebe and that shit simply hit different.
2832,2020-12-30 14:34:50,kn2ccb,You don't think critical acclaim influences the way people perceive an album?
2833,2020-12-30 14:39:50,kn2ccb,"Could still be, people vote what they know. Solid albums though."
2834,2020-12-30 14:08:56,kn2ccb,"Phoebe: ""Hope you are still alive, though it ain't 1955."""

2839,2021-01-01 02:06:22,kn2ccb,We‚Äôre New Again is seriously underrated. People are sleeping on that album.

Also holy shit I didn't realize Vol 2 had come out 2 weeks ago, thanks for this comment so I went to listen to Vol 1 again cuz I have even more new music for today now!"
2841,2020-12-30 15:30:29,kn2ccb,"BRAT is just flat out fantastic. I see a lot of parallels between him and Bartees Strange‚Äôs non-adherence to genre, man they‚Äôd be a fun concert pairing if those still existed. Also, just to pimp BRAT for him, there are only 75 copies of the second press of it left on his [Bandcamp](https://nnamdiogbonnaya.bandcamp.com/album/brat), don‚Äôt sleep."
2842,2020-12-30 18:48:41,kn2ccb,What's a good starting point? That sounds fucked up enough that I have to find out what the hell it sounds like.
2843,2020-12-31 03:06:18,kn2ccb,"> Everyone is just afraid of his ability to rap AND make emo math-rock

And release multiple projects! I was a music director when I got the album and did not know what to do with it based off the cover-but I listened and shit whips. Not my immediate ""gonna play this all the tiome"", but Brat is a terrific debut. Let's get Nnamdi working with Moor Mother"
2844,2020-12-30 15:30:16,kn2ccb,"Me too! It was my favorite album this year but I didn‚Äôt vote and didn‚Äôt notice much praise here from others, so I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised"

1. Research Reactor Corp. - The Collected Findings of the Research Reactor Corporation 
2. Walter Martin - The World at Night 
3. Neo Neos - Hard Drive Experiments Vol. 2

There are so many probably really good albums there that only one person included"
2848,2020-12-30 21:35:25,kn2ccb,"I only had one, Cameraperson - s/t which I kind of expected.

Also looks like I was one of the few to vote for 2nd Grade - Hit to Hit which I was a bit surprised about. Thought that one had garnered more acclaim / buzz on here."
2849,2020-12-31 13:36:39,kn2ccb,"Pretty sure I was the only person who voted for ""We Live Here"" by Bob Vylan. Which is a travesty because that record fucking rules."
2850,2020-12-31 13:53:07,kn2ccb,Think I was the only one to vote for both Causa Sui and Two People. Both great albums!

Agreed, I can't complain but based on the song results I thought it would have made the top 10 for sure."
2852,2020-12-30 16:58:39,kn2ccb,"Avalanches are one of my favorite artists but no way do I want them to try and rush out another album so close to this one. I feel like their process takes time, from conceptualizing each album, actually writing songs, choosing and clearing samples, etc. I'll hope for a new album by 2022 or 2023."
2853,2020-12-30 15:34:14,kn2ccb,"Gr√¶ and Yves tumor are prob the two I would have bumped up a bit. That and then I love hiphop so I would bump up Alfredo by a lot, but I get why its not as loved around here"

2856,2020-12-30 18:10:59,kn2ccb,More impressive considering she made the album in like the first month or two of quarantine. Was my AOTY. Not a bad song on it.
2857,2020-12-30 17:59:33,kn2ccb,Completely agree. It was my #3.
2858,2020-12-30 17:50:30,kn2ccb,<3 voter fraud is my passion.

2861,2020-12-31 04:46:06,kn2ccb,"100% agree, but I didn‚Äôt really dig their previous music, to be fair I probably didn‚Äôt listen to enough of it outside of the pop hits. But I thoroughly enjoyed this front to back especially those electro garage songs"

2863,2020-12-30 13:57:44,kn2ccb,yeah the critics finally picking up the band really seems to have given them a boost that probably won‚Äôt hit their solo work the same again sadly

But that's what's great about it! Seriously, it's insane how consistently great it is, really surprised me when I first listened to it. And it flows so well but at the same time can be listened to one 20 minute part at a time. It's my AOTY. My favorite tracks are A-Z, Gemstone Break, Silver, Gold Leaf, Being Harsh, Beetlebum, Superstar, Illuminated Biker Gang, DJ Every Night, Car Keys, Dust, Oracle, Note Velocity, Windows, Feeling, Anything Could Happen, Oohu, Triptych Demon, Official, Crimson, Life Speed, The End Has No End, 2021, Hold On, Today, Chandelier, Idyll, Show Me What, Crimson and Clover and Alright."
2865,2020-12-30 16:01:46,kn2ccb,TBf the EP he released was basically just a collection of loosies he released throughout the year. Not much of a complete project
2866,2020-12-30 20:15:43,kn2ccb,With Frank Ocean on the menu I‚Äôd say Charli is this sub‚Äôs favorite off limits artist.
2867,2020-12-30 15:27:44,kn2ccb,Is that in the refined tab or the raw tab?  I did combine instances of songs/instrumentals into songs total where I saw the.  Although keep in mind there were hundreds of duplicate entries so some may have passed me.
2868,2020-12-30 15:13:54,kn2ccb,"Thanks for putting me onto this, really beautiful"
2869,2020-12-31 08:18:55,kn2ccb,Yeah! But I really hoped IH would rank a little higher.
2870,2020-12-31 06:56:33,kn2ccb,"*heavy sigh*

Can‚Äôt even argue that shit. I miss old Future Islands"
2871,2021-01-03 18:19:16,kn2ccb,I would assume it would be similar to this with all the non indie artists out!
2872,2021-01-01 14:53:54,kn2ccb,"They are all in the side bar on old reddit but honestly not sure how to find it on new reddit lol.

Here are some links:

2873,2020-12-30 18:31:35,kn2ccb,I would have told ya they'd be high based on fanboyism alone.  But honestly it's a great album.
2874,2020-12-31 08:27:00,kn2ccb,"Nice flair, bro."
2875,2020-12-30 18:59:04,kn2ccb,"Given how disappointed a lot of fans were, I'm surprised it's so high."
2876,2020-12-30 20:28:06,kn2ccb,"im glad it managed to make it at all, nobody seems to care about it and it‚Äôs their best album imo"
2877,2020-12-30 15:21:29,kn2ccb,"They were combined because too many people just voted for ""untitled"" without specifying which they were voting for."
2878,2020-12-30 21:41:38,kn2ccb,"Take this as coming from a big Four Tet fan, the problem with his recent music is that it sounds too much like Four Tet! I think he needs to change up his sound, the last two albums have sounded middlingly same-ish."
2879,2020-12-30 19:47:51,kn2ccb,"host had to cancel, IRL stuff"
2880,2020-12-31 05:36:40,kn2ccb,Because it got 7 points.
2881,2020-12-31 17:20:10,kn2ccb,Oh I thought I fixed that.  Oops
2882,2021-01-01 19:40:17,kn2ccb,Writer bailed on us.
2883,2020-12-30 22:59:48,kn2ccb,Also more people need to check out Charmed by DJ Sabrina the Teenage DJ. Sure it‚Äôs 3 hours long but it‚Äôs worth it. Lofi house masterpiece
2884,2020-12-31 01:56:03,kn2ccb,Why did I get downvoted lol does this sub have something against Jean Dawson or something? Was he canceled and I missed it? I‚Äôm so confused lol I thought this sub would go crazy over an album like Pixel Bath
2885,2020-12-30 15:01:03,kn2ccb,There were no genre restrictions.
2886,2020-12-30 14:54:31,kn2ccb,"you're right, the mods should have gone through and banned anyone who put a non-indie album in their top 10 /s"
2887,2020-12-30 14:56:40,kn2ccb,this list is made without genre restrictions
2888,2021-01-03 18:21:02,kn2ccb,Interesting take
2889,2020-12-30 23:40:00,kn2ccb,this mf said Charlie XCX
2890,2020-12-31 04:10:54,kn2ccb,did you read the post?  There are no genre restrictions.
2891,2020-12-30 15:00:42,kn2ccb,"No genre restrictions on the list, as mentioned in the post."
2892,2020-12-30 14:56:55,kn2ccb,this list was made without genre restrictions
2893,2020-12-30 15:07:23,kn2ccb,"There are quite a few major label/pop artists in the list (Dua Lipa , Jessie Ware). 

There were no restrictions on genre/label so let the people like what they like i say. I‚Äôm not a fan of TS but her albums this year clearly spoke to a lot of people."
2894,2020-12-30 19:43:16,kn2ccb,"> it crept up on me so much with time that I couldn‚Äôt not have it as my AOTY. 

me too. I kind of hoped my AOTY would be something new and exciting, but in the end it was exactly what I would have expected it to be at the beginning of the year: new Fleet Foxes album"
2895,2020-12-30 17:57:44,kn2ccb,I demand a recount in Pennsylvania
2896,2020-12-30 18:29:14,kn2ccb,"""FETCH THE BALLOT COUNTERS!"""
2897,2020-12-31 17:04:39,kn2ccb,She deserves it for this song alone tbh.
2898,2020-12-31 05:29:23,kn2ccb,Rym?
2899,2020-12-30 20:41:25,kn2ccb,"A very big thank you for sharing this, I was not aware that happened!"
2900,2020-12-30 15:37:33,kn2ccb,It's really good too. √Ä l'ombre des cypr√®s is a great song.
2901,2020-12-31 13:28:32,kn2ccb,Klo Pelgag sounds like a Star Wars character
2902,2020-12-30 18:19:35,kn2ccb,"Assuming everyone who voted for it gave it a 5 (for the sake of simplicity), about 19 people would have voted for it. Conceivably, all of its votes *could* have come from the DMD."
2903,2020-12-31 09:08:59,kn2ccb,"Yea, I thought the Cindy Lee and Deeper albums would have made it to the list."
2904,2020-12-30 19:46:57,kn2ccb,"If anything, their names are more distinctive and I would've noticed if they were talked about. God knows I never would have caught onto any discussion about 'Declan McKenna'"
2905,2020-12-31 06:43:21,kn2ccb,"I‚Äôve always considered myself a bit of a Strokes outcast because Angles has always been my favorite album, but The New Abnormal is absolutely fighting for that spot now. Angles is more cohesive as a project imo, but the peaks of TNA are higher. Either way, I‚Äôm constantly blown away by how much I love the new album and couldn‚Äôt agree with you more."
2906,2020-12-31 08:40:54,kn2ccb,I agree with the points you make and I suppose it is why I never clicked with their past albums as a new Strokes fan who got into them from New Abnormal
2907,2021-01-01 23:47:58,kn2ccb,Any song on *Is This It* is ten times better than *The New Abnormal*.
2908,2021-01-02 01:41:38,kn2ccb,It's like a soft rock version of an actual Strokes album.
2909,2020-12-30 18:44:38,kn2ccb,"Disagree entirely 

Such an amazing album and totally deserves it.

The one that surprised me was Punisher. I just don‚Äôt get this album. Couple standout songs but it‚Äôs so mediocre and if it was someone else who released it I don‚Äôt think this sub would be going so crazy about it"
2910,2020-12-30 15:46:11,kn2ccb,"I'm personally not into the Strokes, but there's a huge silent majority that doesn't post in DMDs so that's why I was thinking it would still place high even if frequent users aren't talking about it."
2911,2020-12-30 17:29:53,kn2ccb,"And it's one I'll never forget, probably one of my favorite albums ever, maybe top 50."
2912,2020-12-31 00:24:18,kn2ccb,ok i‚Äôm going to say it. it‚Äôs my favorite strokes album
2913,2020-12-30 18:58:17,kn2ccb,"Feels overly generous to Sault. I think a more conservative approach would have been to credit the nonspecific ones to the album that got more specific points (which is still generous to Sault). Not that it matters much, but that's my two cents."
2914,2020-12-30 15:04:15,kn2ccb,Y'all made me do it
2915,2020-12-30 17:06:33,kn2ccb,"Recency impacts in both ways I guess (biais + skip) I did not put it on my list but now it would be included.

For less known artists, like Ichiko Aoba, however, I think recency really penalized her. It deserved a even higher spot"
2916,2021-01-15 22:25:01,kn2ccb,Don't know how you feel now but We Will Always Love You has completely captured me over the past few weeks.  What a phenomenal album.  I can't stop playing it and bugging my friends / family with links to songs
2917,2020-12-30 15:34:16,kn2ccb,You take that back!
2918,2020-12-30 18:09:53,kn2ccb,"I feel like it‚Äôs a tough one to quantify. There‚Äôs a lot of filler on it b/c it‚Äôs so long, but there are some amazing songs too, enough that I had it in my top 10."
2919,2020-12-30 16:00:55,kn2ccb,Recency bias
2920,2020-12-30 18:54:26,kn2ccb,Probably lower as it wouldn't be fresh on the mind of everyone anymore.
2921,2020-12-30 19:57:34,kn2ccb,I'm not put off by his vocals but I definitely agree that an instrumental album from him could be amazing!
2922,2020-12-30 15:18:33,kn2ccb,"Bingo. I loved the new Avalanches record, but if was released in January? Not sure if it would be as high."
2923,2020-12-30 16:02:12,kn2ccb,Her album wasn't good.
2924,2020-12-30 18:15:06,kn2ccb,Your Love (Deja Vu) is the one that stood out to me
2925,2020-12-30 20:24:12,kn2ccb,"I agree, but the fact is that CSH has an extremely devoted fanbase that will love whatever they put out. I adore the band, but this album was nowhere near the quality of work that we should expect from them."
2926,2020-12-30 17:34:40,kn2ccb,"She does something for me that I haven't found since Sparklehorse and Elliott Smith. I adore her. I personally prefer the debut, but I want her to get attention anywayz, so."
2927,2020-12-30 16:15:45,kn2ccb,"Critical acclaim definitely has some influence over how highly people rate a certain project, but it won‚Äôt be able to take a song from being met with ambivalence to being loved within a community.

Case in point: WAP, a song that Pitchfork and Fantano (the two most influential critics on this subreddit) placed as their #1 and #2 SOTY. On indieheads? The song didn‚Äôt even place in our top 100."
2928,2020-12-30 14:54:28,kn2ccb,i mean obviously it does but there‚Äôs so many people posturing like it‚Äôs the only factor that people are voting on and not just them liking the album lol
2929,2020-12-30 15:43:08,kn2ccb,"Eh who fucking cares honestly, the fact that people can discover music that way, enjoy it, discuss it, etc. should be the only thing that matters. Everyone is influenced to like something in some way, whether it be a publication or just their friends or whatever. This sub cares way too much about websites and lists and scores, even when they pretend they don't it's absurd"
2930,2020-12-30 15:33:03,kn2ccb,"People pretend that they aren't influenced by the fact that p4k gave that album a 10. 

Not saying that people's love for this album isn't genuine, but I certainly think there is a non-zero percentage of people saying they love the album because they're told that they should."
2931,2020-12-30 21:42:29,kn2ccb,"I listened to it the day it came out, which I'm sure many people did."
2932,2020-12-31 09:05:48,kn2ccb,"Punisher is ranked higher here than it was on the vast majority of publication lists, so I'd say its not just the hype."
2933,2021-01-02 19:45:04,kn2ccb,For me it can influence how likely I am to check a project out. I wasn't super excited for the new Phoebe because none of her music has blown me away in the past. The critical reception encouraged me to check it out but didn't force me to play it on repeat the rest of the year
2934,2020-12-30 17:07:56,kn2ccb,"I know I‚Äôm in the minority here, but I‚Äôm not a big Fiona Apple fan. I really do think that she‚Äôs talented, but she‚Äôs difficult to listen to. That being said, I totally see why people love her. I‚Äôm just not her audience."
2935,2020-12-30 23:51:45,kn2ccb,yeah rolling stone loves uhhhh protomartyr
2936,2020-12-30 17:47:59,kn2ccb,"Or maybe, just maybe, they simply think Shore is a better album?"
2937,2020-12-30 18:54:40,kn2ccb,[To quote Super Hans from Peep Show...](https://generate.gifglobe.com/?s=peepshow&e=S09E01&i=S09E01-xBUAi3b6&t1=Fuck%20off!&t2=I%20heard%20the%20Strokes%20before%20you)
2938,2020-12-31 16:49:52,kn2ccb,"How the hell does *any one* say that about The Strokes?

20 years strong. A dud or two in the discography, but even still those albums have some good songs.

Most of their peers (if they‚Äôre even still in business) can‚Äôt hold their jock strap. Hell swap out the two bad Strokes records for Jules and Albert‚Äôs solo stuff, and Casablancas makes such cool music with the voidz."
2939,2020-12-30 21:28:28,kn2ccb,"I'm a weird one. I like the Cuttin Grass Vol 1 songs better than the originals. I've already listened to that album so many times, it always instantly lifts my mood if I'm having a bad day. Enjoy Vol 2! I don't think it's as strong but it's still definitely great."
2940,2020-12-30 18:52:59,kn2ccb,"Brat is probably his most accessible place to start, but if you want some bonkers hip-hop, either Feckin Wierdo or Drool."
2941,2020-12-30 20:47:12,kn2ccb,"Dammit, I would‚Äôve given Walt a 2nd (that album was in my top 5 of the year) if I voted."
2942,2020-12-30 20:57:19,kn2ccb,"Sounds like something I should check out, I'll put it on my list! And yeah, there's going to be some gems in there, maybe more people will reply to me with them."
2943,2020-12-30 15:47:53,kn2ccb,Yes I agree that Yves Tumor should be higher as well. Very comfortably in my top 5 this year. And honestly a couple of the albums here that finished higher than Moses and Yves are feeling quite uninspired to me.
2944,2020-12-30 18:13:59,kn2ccb,And only about 6 months after her last album! Prolific queen
2945,2020-12-31 05:22:18,kn2ccb,Yeah the electro garage was certainly new but was a tiny bit foreshadowed on previous songs like How to Draw and I like it when you sleep.
2946,2020-12-31 15:26:13,kn2ccb,Discovering them now when they already have so much great material has been awesome. Their stuff is really undeniably great and I know they said they're taking a little break but it's awesome as a fan how prolific they are that they'll surely have an album out in the next two years or so.
2947,2020-12-30 16:57:20,kn2ccb,"Yeah that‚Äôs fair, but pretty much all those songs were bangers imo"
2948,2020-12-30 20:17:08,kn2ccb,could you explain what you mean by that? (genuinely don't understand not trying to be rude or anything lol)
2949,2020-12-30 15:31:53,kn2ccb,The additional entries came after the 'I stopped hand counting around here' mark at #200.
2950,2021-01-01 19:21:52,kn2ccb,Thank you!
2951,2020-12-30 15:26:35,kn2ccb,"Thanks.
Kinda sad we cannot know which one ranks higher but you did right !"
2952,2020-12-30 22:21:39,kn2ccb,"I really thought Sixteen Candles was a step up from his last one. Looking at reviews, I'm surprised by how lukewarm they are. I played it a lot over the summer.

I'd probably also have Caribou's Suddenly as my top album of the year so I think I'm just out of step the current zeitgeist. Been a weird year."
2953,2020-12-30 19:56:19,kn2ccb,"ah that's a shame, I hope they're doing alright"
2954,2020-12-31 08:25:10,kn2ccb,"Oh no, that's too bad. It was such fun. I guess there's no one else who would volunteer to continue it? Anyway, hope u/American_Soviet is ok."
2955,2020-12-30 15:01:12,kn2ccb,"No need to be mean about it, I am legit wondering what is considered indie now since the lines from indie to pop are so blurred."
2956,2020-12-30 14:59:29,kn2ccb,This but unironically
2957,2020-12-31 15:08:42,kn2ccb,oh lol I'm dumb
2958,2020-12-30 16:39:02,kn2ccb,"Correct, which is why I‚Äôm likely receiving so much backlash. While it may be true that followers of this subreddit listened to music other than indie (shocker), I just found it odd to see these major label artists on a subreddit dedicated to listeners of indie music. Which really no longer means ‚Äúindependent,‚Äù it‚Äôs just a sound or a vibe these days. I guess I was just hoping to see top 100 artists or albums specifically within the genre of independent/indie music. The initial comment was just to show my surprise with the cross genre results."
2959,2020-12-30 18:12:57,kn2ccb,sadly fiona wasn't affected by typos and she had pretty much the only album that high up that nobody managed to misspell lol
2960,2020-12-30 18:55:25,kn2ccb,"‚Äú...in the same bed, your daughter Wisconsin‚Äù"
2961,2020-12-31 07:02:46,kn2ccb,"Rateyourmusic 

It‚Äôs a website that allows users to rate albums on a 0.5-5 scale, and is identified heavily with indie/alternative music type taste"
2962,2021-01-01 02:29:19,kn2ccb,Holy shit someone else loves *Angles*!!
2963,2021-01-02 07:15:45,kn2ccb,"I don't agree, sorry. Also, when I sad sad surprise, I meant that I didn't expect Perfume Genius getting that much less votes."
2964,2020-12-30 21:34:50,kn2ccb,"Well, if someone else released it, it wouldn't be the same so no, we wouldn't go crazy about it."
2965,2020-12-31 00:41:30,kn2ccb,Man I could say the exact same about The Strokes. Sounds like bog-standard catchy garage rock - really don't get the hype this place gave it.
2966,2020-12-30 16:03:16,kn2ccb,Lol I love that you used silent majority to describe strokes fans. The vocal minority certainly loves to hate them
2967,2020-12-31 01:47:01,kn2ccb,Sorry I'm new here but what's DMD's?
2968,2020-12-30 19:42:22,kn2ccb,One got 9 points and the other got 8. And the rest was untitled.  So wouldn't make much difference.
2969,2020-12-30 15:10:00,kn2ccb,"Wow sorry i was scrolling for a while so i didnt see you already commented before i wrote that haha

Btw i specified my vote was for ‚ÄúBlack Is‚Äù because i am perfect but i guess not everyone can be like me üòú"
2970,2021-01-15 22:51:40,kn2ccb,Definitely! Still in frequent rotation
2971,2020-12-30 21:19:48,kn2ccb,"Yeah I'm not put off, it's just not my favorite I guess. I have to be in a specific mood for Thundercat."
2972,2020-12-30 17:32:00,kn2ccb,"I dunno, I also sort of think if it was released in October instead of December it'd be higher. Hard to say."
2973,2020-12-30 17:23:37,kn2ccb,"That's a good point. I do think there is a lot more consensus around albums rather than songs though and maybe more of a desire, even if subconsciously, to have the right taste and top albums. 

I find the whole concept strange and I think over the past decade or so there's been an increase of 'everyone's a critic'. I mean I've never in my life listened to an album and thought 'I'd give that a 7.5', or 'that's in my top 20... maybe even my top 10 of the year!' I think this community is great but something has happened to the way music is consumed that bothers me.

Sorry for the tangential rant, and it's nothing to do with Fiona, I think it's a real swell record. A tad musical theatre, but real swell nonetheless"
2974,2020-12-30 20:13:30,kn2ccb,"Personally, I don‚Äôt really give pitchfork any credence these days, but as a Fiona Apple fan it was still neat to see her get that kind of recognition (even though she hasn‚Äôt lacked for critical praise over her career as it is). But now some of my friends think that that critical acclaim is *why* I like the album so much, which is irritating. It also give me some insight into how those friends think of me."
2975,2020-12-30 17:27:57,kn2ccb,"Um, are there people who care what score p4k gives to an album? I find any 10 they give comical because their scores are generally shit and don't even make sense."
2976,2020-12-30 18:41:47,kn2ccb,"Im cool with that, Shore is a great album, I just don‚Äôt understand the constant Strokes slander"
2977,2021-01-01 04:34:37,kn2ccb,"Little Joy is another underrated Strokes side project, right?  Throw that on the pile!"
2978,2020-12-30 21:39:39,kn2ccb,"There's definitely some songs in Cuttin Grass vol 1 that I prefer over the originals, off the top of my head is Breakers Roar and Long White Line. Others I prefer the original of, like Turtles All The Way Down. 

But honestly there's something fun about the twang of Cuttin Grass that I really love, and songs like I Don't Mind (which I don't think has an original?) have become some of my favourite Sturgill songs of all time! Just another hour or so until works over and I can blast Vol 2 on the way home!

Edit: So apparently Sturgill was part of another band that isn't available on Canadian Spotify called Sunday Valley and I Don't Mind was a song of theirs. I'd also love to hear that version of Oh Sarah but can't find it on YouTube"
2979,2020-12-30 20:56:04,kn2ccb,"Oh shit I've heard this guy! He was on a playlist Jeff Rosenstock shared on twitter and i thought it was pretty neat, I've put the album on now."
2980,2020-12-30 23:17:36,kn2ccb,You could have gotten him up to the top 300 smh
2981,2020-12-30 16:33:33,kn2ccb,"Gr√¶ was for sure better than impala for me, amd there is no way Im taking swift over gibbs. The top 2 are solid tho"
2982,2020-12-31 16:39:36,kn2ccb,Absolutely. There‚Äôs so much to listen to and each album is different than the one before it. Seems to be a 1975 song for every possible mood I find myself in. Glad you‚Äôre enjoying their stuff and I can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs next
2983,2020-12-30 20:51:39,kn2ccb,"There are certain times when this sub discusses all music, such as this list, but generally it is limited to the admittedly nebulous genre of indie music.

For a long time people wanted to discuss Frank Ocean here because he's an independent artist. The main knock was that he's massively mainstream--but, so are Arctic Monkeys, and plenty ""indie acts"" are actually on major labels. So the Ocean ban was lifted within the last year or so.

Charli is similar to Frank. She has tons of fans here. She's quite innovative with her take on pop and not exactly mainstream, but she's still a pop artist on a major label. Her past two albums have been especially well received on this sub."
2984,2020-12-30 15:41:54,kn2ccb,"Ah yeah I see.  They misspelled ""adrienne"".  Unfortunately I could only do so much to help correct people's formatting and spelling issues."
2985,2020-12-31 00:22:54,kn2ccb,"That makes sense. My not so hot take on the current zeitgeist is that late 2000s and early 2010s acts like Caribou, Four Tet and Burial have pretty much become the Dads of electronic music at this point, producing steady but same-ish music. Personally speaking, current stalwarts in the genre would be Nicolas Jaar and Jamie XX, and maybe even Bonobo though I think he's at risk of moving into Dad status himself. Maybe Jon Hopkins too. Anyone else I'm missing?"
2986,2020-12-31 13:13:06,kn2ccb,more just nobody had the raw data for it on hand and would‚Äôve had to start a new bracket from scratch

It's fair to wonder about what the definition is, but it doesn't really have any bearing on this list"
2989,2020-12-30 16:43:29,kn2ccb,The spreadsheet has the real indie on it.  Take a look just passed the top 100 and you'll find real underground at stuff like Lady Gaga.
2990,2020-12-31 13:47:50,kn2ccb,"Matt Berninger from The National wrote most of the album with Taylor, I suspect because of a that a lot of people on this sub that wouldn't normally listen to her ended up listening to and liking the album."

2995,2020-12-30 22:08:03,kn2ccb,"Shouldn‚Äôt we be judging the album and the music not the artist?

The album is so ‚Äúsame‚Äù outside of a few (garden song, I know the end, Kyoto stood out to me) 

I‚Äôm happy she‚Äôs getting the acclaim tho she‚Äôs obviously very talented"
2996,2020-12-31 03:01:42,kn2ccb,"As a no1?  No way.  I will get hated for this, but it‚Äôs not very musically exciting, the songs are not saying much new.  Fiona, on the other hand, really came with something fresh and exhilarating, both musically and from a production standpoint."
2997,2020-12-31 00:52:26,kn2ccb,"Lol then you haven‚Äôt listened to the new album at all 

Almost every song is totally different and only TAAT has the garage rock vibe

If you‚Äôre talking about their first two albums I‚Äôd agree with you but they‚Äôre still far more variable than anything on Punisher."
2998,2020-12-30 17:32:44,kn2ccb,"Tbh, aside from the first album, I find their work boring. I first got interested in JC on his solo album, and I really have been absolutely jazzed since he started The Voidz. That project is a million times more my speed. I also love his work with The Growlers. I'm not on here trashing on The Strokes, but I just miss what it is that folks really enjoy about their stuff since Is This It."

Kelly Lee Owens got love in these end of year lists and, although she's not old, her sound belongs in that discussion too I think"

3019,2020-12-30 18:23:15,kn2ccb,I understand trying out an album because a publication gave it a high score but do people actually pretend to like things they don't? Why?

3022,2020-12-30 18:23:35,kn2ccb,"Yea. I prefer wild, exuberant, complex stuff. My favorite bands are The Mars Volta, Animal Collective, and Pink Floyd lol."
3023,2020-12-30 19:01:53,kn2ccb,"I think it's not so much about consciously pretending to ""like"" something they actually don't like, and more about a subconscious bias that makes people like the album slightly more than they originally would have. If I listen to a good album that is getting rave reviews from pretty much everywhere, I think I have a tendency to place more importance on that album and think of it as better than I would have if it was getting terrible reviews everywhere. It's the same the other way around too, where I've started listening to something (example: AJR) and I liked it but then when I saw that it get generally very negative reviews, I stopped listening because I hadn't yet developed a deeper connection to them and something stopped me from enjoying them in the same way anymore. Anyways, sorry that was a tangental ramble but it's something that's been on my mind recently about how for many of us, critical reception informs our opinions about music more than we would like to admit."
3024,2020-12-30 22:39:43,kn2ccb,You think people carefully come to their own conclusions on things?
3025,2020-12-30 21:20:01,kn2ccb,"you're missing out dude, under cover of darkness is one of the catchiest songs ever written imo."
3026,2020-12-30 23:32:45,kn2ccb,Catchy isn't a trait I look for in music.
3027,2020-12-31 02:36:10,kn2ccb,"that's fair, i love animal collective as well but it's mainly because i find their songs to be extremely catchy buried underneath tons of cool noise. what draws you to their first album?"
3028,2020-12-31 02:25:19,kn2ccb,"This is r/indieheads where we downvote for politely not being interested in simple, catchy music. Bahhahaha. Stay true, bbs."
3029,2020-12-31 04:31:20,kn2ccb,The first one evokes something quite different for me. It's got a lofi / garage feel to it while the later stuff is much more polished / big studio sounding. It has a subversive and rebellious sensibility that's somehow really laid back. There are echoes of punk and glam and it feels incredibly youthful and mature at the same time. It just has something special that I don't feel like they retained (not that I would expect or demand they do; I love that artists grow and change).

**Brie Larson's record...**

She won just a single match in Season 1 (League 4), with a slight improvement in Season 2 of two wins.

Since then, she won a massive 16 points in Season 3, gaining her promotion to League 3, where she has so far gone unbeaten.

**Taylor Swift's record...**

After winning just one out of her first fourteen matches, resulting in a duo of relegations, Taylor has since gone on to earn 16 points in Season 3 - just narrowly missing out on promotion. She has so far got 7 out of a possible 9 points this season and also has a Cup under her belt after winning La Lega."

3070,2020-12-30 20:59:08,kmzvrx,"I think folklore and evermore are supposed to be the fictionalized accounts of whatever is inspiring all this music. Yeah, too many songs about marriages, loss/rejection, yearning, love triangles to not make it all inspired by the same thing/person, right? 

That tweet about folklore says:*""In isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result. I‚Äôve told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love, wonder, and whimsy they deserve.""* So it's her using imaginary characters to tell the story of whatever happened and she is allowing us to project whatever we want on to it (like any good piece of art, also mirrorball backs this up?) but imo it does come from a real place, full of all these emotions caused by something. 

This also might explain the pushing of James as a male character in betty... Taylor is the author so she can create whatever story she wants but I think it's clear that betty is inspired by the same themes/emotions as the rest of both albums.  But she's still allowing us to think whatever we want about this love triangle right? Like she had to put it out there that it could be a male perspective for all her fans that want to project that relationship onto it but as we all know the lyrics and her singing say something different (queer subtext!). This lense works for all the other songs too I think. 

I also think that evermore might have been in the works before the pandemic hit....call me crazy but it was a late year-december release like all other Taylor releases (except Lover) and we know this girl plans shit out and this would also fit my theory that evermore is the follow up to reputation. folklore is still the pandemic album though...because that album definitely feels more like she's been sitting around this whole quarantine using art as therapy for again whatever happened to inspire all this whereas evermore gives me a feeling like it was written as a response to whatever happened and then she wrote folklore to help create this idea of myths and stories and writing from another perspective to make it more inclusive 

I just wrote a post about the listening order of all this and I'm starting to think the track 6s may be the answer lol.... Taylor has killed the old version of herself (LWYMMD, no body no crime \[i mean this song is a true crime fiction!\]) and she is reinventing herself again (mirrorball) .... this may be projection of my hope that she moves into a more adult singer/songwriter era.... kind of like her namesake James Taylor (highly recommend listening to evermore and folklore with some 70s singers like Carole King, James Taylor, Joni Mitchell and I think the tapestry line in champagne problems could actually be a reference to Tapestry by Carole King) 

Honestly if any of this is true Taylor is a fucking genius lol. I've had so much fun looking at these albums in depth the last few days!"

3072,2020-12-30 21:41:28,kmzvrx,"Actually looking at evermore lyrics w/o thinking the album is fictional stories makes it a much more personal album imo. Almost all the songs on it only use pronouns and anonymous characters with the only names being Dorothea and then Este and Majorie (which we know are named after real people hmmm?) and then folklore is the album with named characters and different perspectives (Bill and Rebekah, Betty-James-Inez triangle)... this album has been a lot to process.

3076,2020-12-30 10:55:23,kmytmf,"It's possible since music is more fragmented than it was 10 years ago, which is a trend that's likely to continue for the reason that it serves the consumer by allowing them to pursue their own tastes more.

I don't think the music megastar will vanish completely, though. What it really comes down to is what we even mean by the idea of fame. In my opinion, what separates the music megastar from the ""ordinary"" famous musician is that their fame *transcends* music. For example, the artists you mentioned in your first paragraph have enormous fame even with people who have *never heard their music* - and you might be surprised by how many people this is. That fame comes because they have broken into the mainstream media and news cycle. Yes, their music was/is extremely popular, but their megastar status wasn't ordained by music listeners. Instead it was ordained by the media (then controlled by mainstream outlets, now more so driven by social media) that accepted them into a world of general celebrity which is ""more global"" than music culture.

In conclusion, the reason why I don't think megastars will disappear is that media (whether traditional or social media) will always be looking to crown a new celebrity whether or not the music itself has been heard by as many people - and ultimately it is media that decides who the celebrity will be, not music listeners.

EDIT: what has also changed, arguably, is that - like music culture - mainstream media culture is also more fragmented and driven by diverse social media rather than uniform entertainment journalism outlets. If there are fewer new music megastars now than there was in the past, it may be because social media can't agree who they should be."
3077,2020-12-30 09:51:31,kmytmf,"Yes but also no. While people's music taste is definitely more eclectic on average these days which is going to lead to more niche artists rising to a moderate level of fame, I see no reason to believe that with the truly massive artists of today like Drake, Billie, Travis Scott, The Weeknd, BTS, Ariana being as huge as they are that there's any sign of the superstar slowing down."
3078,2020-12-31 02:55:29,kmytmf,"I think it depends on what we are considering stardom. No one is really standing out to me as say a Madonna, Janet, Mariah, or a Michael. Rihanna was on track but took a detour into the fashion industry. Beyonce is Beyonce. But when I think of even a Katy Perry or Ed Sheeran...Hell, even a Grande or BTS, something is missing. Where is that staying power. They may last a few years, then fade. Where is that extra oomf at? Even Justin Beiber has practically faded. Some have definitely emerged (Taylor Swift) but music is always an ebb and flow. Especially in my millennial generation."
3079,2020-12-30 13:39:00,kmytmf,"With the continued evolution of how we consume music, along with the prosperity of social media, it‚Äôs now even easier for young (career-wise) artists to expand their fan base, thus increasing music discovery without a radio personality telling us what to listen to."

These things always seem clearer in retrospect so 10/20 years from now you'll be able to pinpoint who the biggest stars of the era were much like you have with the early 2000's

>Whereas now I feel music is far more fragmented.

Admittedly I'm older than some here at 44, but I really don't get this sense at all. If this sub is in any way representative of how younger people view music then you're just wrong. I see far more young people here (teens to early 20's) focussing on what the biggest artist of the day is than I ever saw as a young person. Nobody really gave a shit about top 40/Mainstream music back when I was a teen and noting ""the biggest current thing"" seems far more prevalent now than I remember it ever being as a kid."

Passing fads like Sheeran and Del Rey sure, since marketing needs recognisable faces to brand products. Regional heroes or underground/cult icons, sure it happens. 

It is a wider societal issue.

As for the ones you mention (Eminem, Rihana etc.), no one having lived them in their heyday really cares about them. Mercury sold out movie theaters worldwide while being 6 ft under for 30 years based on name recognition alone. The Beatles and Zeppelin are still selling out re-issues of their past work and are deified in pop-culture for ever. There is no comparisson."

I think the argument comes from people who are not really as in touch with new music as they'd like to think they are. The argument makes sense too: without MTV or radio's dominance you would expect the mainstream artists to not have the popularity they oncehad, but for whatever reason this proved false. 

I listed only three artists at the start but while writing this post I kept coming up with more and more artists I could include, which I feel just proves my point."

Before it was a lot more centered around the radio and what big companies were promoting the hardest. That middleman can now be totally fixed, so you can better curate what you listen to to your own tastes, being able to look for new music whenever at no financial risk, since it costs nothing extra to go to an artist's page you've never heard before and listen to their stuff, whereas you used to actually have to sink money into buying a record."

You say it as if it was a bad thing. 

Rather than having a few artists who dominate the scene whose music is written and produced by the same people it is better for music consumers to have a wider palette of moderately popular artists to chose from. Perhaps people got bored with the samey music in the 2000's mainstream and tried to find artists closer to their tastes.

That makes so much sense. Yeah I guess you're right. I just have felt over the past few years there isn't the same crop of people like there were in early 2000's (eminem, rihanna etc). So maybe the media has been 'failing' to crown anybody a celebrity? Maybe haha I don't know

I agree, they probably wont slow down but I guess I am arguing that there wont be any 'new' ones in the future because all these examples are at least a couple of years old and there seems to be fewer and fewer truly 'global' superstars coming out every year. 

Don't know, just my opinion"
3091,2020-12-30 14:56:43,kmytmf,"Agreed, which is why I feel that more and more people can get moderate levels of fame and success rather than fewer with superstar levels of fame and success.

It has evened out the playing field and more people can be successful but since there is so much more competition (and less money in record labels) there are fewer 'superstars'. Most of the ones you think of became superstars years ago rather than any recent ones. 

Strictly my opinion"
3092,2020-12-30 18:23:14,kmytmf,"Coming in about 5 years older than you, and generally agree with your sentiments with a couple of exceptions that I think stem from the age difference. Generally speaking, my peers and I who became adults in the late 1980s were more into the Top 40 of that day. We'd also see that contrary camp that said Top 40 sucked and would go out of their way to be Alternative (Smiths, Depeche Mode, Siouxsie and the Banshees, etc).  I was that kid who sorta listened to everything, including Zeppelin, Rush, Elvis Costello, and even my ""Dad's music"" like the Doors, Beatles, etc.

Now the reason I say that 5 years between us makes a difference is that the whole grunge  and alternative thing just passed right by me and the folks in my social circle of the early 90s."
3093,2020-12-30 20:53:23,kmytmf,"I‚Äôm the same age as you and I think the reason we didn‚Äôt care so much about the top 40 when we were teens is because a lot of that music wasn‚Äôt made for teens. Did *you* know anyone in high school who listened to Michael Bolton or Celine Dion? Because I sure as hell did not, that was for old people. Even early Mariah Carey came across a bit stuffy, and she was an actual young person! Meanwhile Nirvana only had two top 40 US hits, but they were extremely relevant to our age group. Nowadays the music that hits the top 40 is mostly relevant to teenagers, so they‚Äôre more likely to care than we did."

But yeah, I think streaming services have paved the way for so many more artists to have exposure and as such the market is more saturated so it's harder to stand out and reach that 'superstar' status. Which is a good and bad thing I guess"

Nah, that wasnt my point. I am not saying they matter, I just meant in the past it was easy to tell who the superstars were because you could see who they were at award shows whereas now there are so many that award shows don't have the select few 'superstars'"

3114,2020-12-30 09:43:38,kmylkm,"Wow somehow I forgot this song existed. Ill never forget how perfectly this song captured everything. And most of all, despite how sad it is, it perfectly makes me remember how I felt as a long time Suzanne Collins fan when this movie came out and THG really exploded."
3115,2020-12-30 13:57:41,kmylkm,Ngl Taylor is kind of what I would expect a grown up Prim to look like.
3116,2020-12-30 10:58:56,kmylkm,My favourite song from the Hunger Games series is from Catching Fire and it‚Äôs Yellow Flicker Beat by Lorde.
3117,2020-12-30 13:03:37,kmylkm,"Totally agree. They got the feel PERFECT for the first movie/book. It feels incredibly woodsy, sad, beautiful, lullaby-ish.

I miss those days"
3118,2020-12-30 14:39:41,kmylkm,That legit hurt to read but yes kinda
3119,2020-12-30 13:33:16,kmylkm,That was for Mockingjay Part 1
3120,2020-12-30 14:01:15,kmylkm,That‚Äôs right. My bad
3121,2020-12-30 09:26:56,kmxvsu,"Depends heavily on where those picks are. If it‚Äôs a early first the 2nd trade is more appealing as I think swift has similar outlook to Taylor but a early 1st and Higgins> Chark and Aiyuk + a 2nd. If it‚Äôs mid to late, the first trade has more chance to hit cause of pure volume. 

However I caution making this kind of trade until you are sure this is the best price you can get for Davante, he‚Äôs a top 3 WR rn."
3122,2020-12-30 12:27:02,kmxvsu,"Word, I'm new to dynasty so the way I'm looking at him is regression is coming within the next two years and better to sell high. What's your thoughts if you don't mind?"
3123,2020-12-30 18:51:59,kmxvsu,"Regression comes for a number of reasons. Mostly changing situation, injury, or lowered volume. He‚Äôs at least guaranteed to be a packer next year, the primary target of a HoF QB with perennial MVP upside. He does get injured for at least a few games a year, but so does every top receiver it seems. I like the talent and upside more than I fear the regression, if I have a top player like that I like to hold until you really see the regression, then sell before the price drops too far. With Kittle/Kelce/Adams/Ridley/Terry/Mixon as your core, I‚Äôd primarily be trying to add a stud RB to try to make a championship run."

3153,2020-12-30 07:04:30,kmx1nb,Cause she never wrote it.
3154,2020-12-30 06:45:46,kmx1nb,"it‚Äôs almost as if pop stars don‚Äôt actually write their own music, hmm"
3155,2020-12-30 21:29:58,kmx1nb,Of all the pop stars to shoot at with ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt write her own stuff‚Äù. Taylor Swift has been pretty established as a singer and song writer for her music.
3156,2020-12-30 09:48:27,kmx1nb,That happens when you sing a song written by a ghost writer üòí
3157,2020-12-30 10:20:42,kmx1nb,"What's with all the people saying ""well, d'uh, she didn't write it."" I didn't write the song, either, and I recognized it immediately. She plays this song probably every show and likely has since 2015. She just froze up in the moment and over thought it."
3158,2020-12-30 16:06:24,kmx1nb,That does sound like shake it off if you had to modify it to the point that youtube algorithims cant dmca strike it.
3159,2020-12-30 14:02:17,kmx1nb,"i know that yall are just joking but for the record, she writes the base of all her songs and her cowriters mostly edit what she already did... and shake it off is her biggest hit so she probably froze or it was scripted"
3160,2020-12-30 20:32:44,kmx1nb,Well that's embarrassing...
3161,2021-01-06 22:35:31,kmx1nb,"It sounds a bit off...
Besides isn't all this shit scripted anyway?"
3162,2020-12-30 09:22:16,kmx1nb,Band fucking sucked tho
3163,2020-12-30 09:37:32,kmx1nb,"Lol , cuz she doesn't write her own songs.

3170,2020-12-30 17:16:03,kmx1nb,"Because her music is pop for 14yo girls and her rich daddy paid for her career therefore it's fun to bring her down. Just something people do when they feel someone has something undeserved, nothing new."
