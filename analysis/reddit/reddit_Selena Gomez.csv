24,2020-02-05 16:32:30,ezaf59,She's amazing
25,2020-02-05 16:35:56,ezaf59,Beautiful and nice gorgeous 😍❤️
26,2020-02-05 22:09:48,ezaf59,Sexiest I've ever seen her.

33,2020-02-05 22:55:45,ezaf59,She definitely knows what she’s doing!
34,2020-02-05 21:47:18,ezaf59,Sexy boobs & legs. Do her in a heartbeat
35,2020-02-06 00:43:18,ezaf59,"Perhaps we should've been more specific when we asked the Genie for *""Selena Gomez wearing a huge pearl necklace.""*"
36,2020-02-06 01:17:42,ezaf59,The things that i’d do to her would violate several treaties of the Geneva convention.
37,2020-02-06 11:51:24,ezaf59,Thank god they finally kicked her out of the library!
38,2020-02-23 15:41:46,ezaf59,so hot
39,2020-02-06 04:18:02,ezaf59,"The person who took this photo really did a lousy job.  Shadows in the face, no feeling. Just a crappy pose with cheap props."
40,2020-02-05 17:04:03,ezaf59,Sexy but poor photoshop.  Selena doesn't havr boobs like that also.
41,2020-02-05 18:32:56,ezaf59,Same lol
42,2020-02-05 23:12:13,ezaf59,I think it is...
43,2020-02-06 02:03:51,ezaf59,Well der BUT have you seen her video clips she has crazy eyes.

45,2020-02-05 21:45:55,ezaf59,"Actually, none of the photos from this shoot are retouched. You can ever see her surgery scar in one of them.

And if you bothered to look at her recent candids you would know her boobs are really big now.

In conclusion, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about."
46,2020-02-05 17:18:14,ezaf59,"Uh, is this the first pic of her you've ever seen? Yes she does."
47,2020-03-30 09:03:57,ezaf59,VS sells bras that can boost size by two cups. It’s not that difficult to get a nice bra. They even sell strapless ones.
48,2020-02-06 03:03:43,ezaf59,Crazy eyes?
49,2020-02-06 03:09:43,ezaf59,I don't doubt it. Honestly I don't think it's possible to be a teen celebrity and be normal.
50,2020-02-05 17:19:27,ezaf59,That's actually her.  But not this one...this poor photoshop.  She has too big of a boob to be hers.
51,2020-02-11 15:25:32,ezaf59,"Yeah Imma call bullshit on that one, I worked as a photographer and the chance that such a photoshoot wouldn't be edited is exactly zero. It would also be not very typical of her because her pictures are generally quite heavily edited. 

And you can see it if you have experience in common retouching techniques like airbrushing, if her scar is visible the most likely scenario is that they simply left it in on purpose which is exactly what I would do to keep a sense of realism and have plausible deniability.

He clearly doesn't know what he's talking about but I honestly think neither do you."
52,2020-02-05 21:55:53,ezaf59,You were educating about something until you fucked up being a teacher by putting me down bastard.
53,2020-02-05 19:28:38,ezaf59,"Are you joking or you really don't understand how bras work?

Edit: shit she looks bigger in the other two pics than the first one"
54,2020-02-05 19:45:51,ezaf59,You bro you retarded?
55,2020-02-11 23:16:04,ezaf59,"I'm not saying there's absolutely no retouching, mr. expert, but the point of the discussion was about if they made her boobs look bigger or not. So why would they leave the scar there and make her breasts bigger?"
56,2020-02-06 03:16:32,ezaf59,Is English not your first language?
57,2020-02-05 20:36:38,ezaf59,Nice one of using the R word on me.  You are the one who the R word not me.
58,2020-02-06 03:46:46,ezaf59,Fuck you! Bor and raised in America!  Careful how you assume things about people.
59,2020-02-05 20:57:20,ezaf59,You ARE retarded

83,2020-02-05 12:41:24,ez8ogx,"ugh i wish she actually used an aesthetic like this for the actual album. in fact, i wish that this aesthetic actually matched the music. i would love to see her make some, no offence, but actually interesting and unique music."
84,2020-02-05 14:14:15,ez8ogx,"Lovely interview, and beautiful picture too. One thing stood out to me, though - when asked about if she feels like she’s representing Latinos despite releasing English music, she says “... I’m always very vocal about my background...” - I’ve NEVER heard hear really “speak” about being Latina / having a Latin background? (I DO NOT MEAN THIS AS A CRITICIZE in any way PLZ I’m just interested!!!!) I know she’s sung in Spanish a little, and of course lately her immigration work, but is there anything else? What is she referring to?"
85,2020-02-05 22:32:54,ez8ogx,She says Obtener Un Si by Shakira is her favorite latin song? Whew the taste! I guess I have no choice but to stan
86,2020-02-05 12:48:21,ez8ogx,bad liar and fetish were unique.
87,2020-02-05 22:51:22,ez8ogx,Seriously. This is her best photoshoot in years. Compared to the album cover.... it’s a choice
88,2020-02-05 14:26:30,ez8ogx,"[https://twitter.com/fuckubeetta/status/1033701466597404673](https://twitter.com/fuckubeetta/status/1033701466597404673)

There's even more examples of her doing so throughout the years like from her first years on Disney. There used to be a bigger thread but I think it got deleted.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ARzJ6lsVs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ARzJ6lsVs)"
89,2020-02-05 18:31:50,ez8ogx,"She has mentioned her roots a few times, but for her to say she’s “always very vocal” about her background isn’t true. It has always bothered me that she only acknowledges her Latina background when she’s asked about it (like this interview) or when she’s asked to be on the cover of Latina magazine or being featured in a Spanish song. 

Her mom, who is white, raised her so it’s not Selena’s fault if she doesn’t feel a connection to the culture, but the fact that she only acknowledges it when it’s convenient to her is why a lot of Latinos don’t like her. Only recently she started speaking up about immigration issues, which I am happy about because she’s using her platform for good, but not before getting a lot of flak over being silent on issues Latinos face."
90,2020-02-05 22:54:32,ez8ogx,"With that last name she literally always has to talk about it lol can’t avoid it, even though she didn’t even grow up with her dad, which is where she for her Mexican from. I’m happy she still represents and does good work for our community"

Looking back 2017 was a hot year for him, I think that album would have sounded like Where Are U Now w/possible strong hip hop influences, which would have been amazing to listen to. I never thought about it but I really really like his EDM stuff like Beauty and a Beat, Cold Water, Let Me Love You, Friends and Sorry.

Justin needs to get back in the studio with Skrillex and churn out EDM bangers."

111,2020-02-04 22:45:56,eyxqoo,"I don't mind celebrity makeup lines if the makeup matches the celebrity's signature style.

Lady Gaga struck out big time.  She's known for her out there and wild looks on the red carpet (hello meat dress) yet her first palette was something you could have seen any other brand do. It was just so generic.  Even more of a missed opportunity was that an edgy gothy brand was taking a steep nosedive and the opening was right there on a silver platter.  

To me her line would be like Taylor Swift releasing a makeup line without red lipstick."
112,2020-02-04 21:55:22,eyxqoo,"Absolutely oversaturated! Many makeup lovers & collectors have slowly been getting brand/makeup fatigue. But this comes in waves. 

We all had a time where we excited to try all these new things and to get this palette or this single eyeshadow, so on. As that wave becomes more of a collector rather than an enthusiast, more waves will come. Younger generations will buy into these new brands, just like we did with Colourpop, Fenty, etc. Then eventually they too will get to the point many of us are.

A video by BeautyNews explained this beautifully. While it is oversaturated and although many of us feel like there’s no more room for brands, there are always new, developing makeup lovers who will find excitement in a new brand while many “seasoned” makeup lovers find it unnecessary to the market."
113,2020-02-04 22:26:54,eyxqoo,"I don't care too much about how many celebs launch makeup lines, but I do care when it's a half-assed effort lol. 

Victoria, Rihanna and heck, even Kesha can stay (I don't listen to her music but her palette is lovely!)

but Millie and Gaga....just, so unwarranted lol"
114,2020-02-04 23:56:40,eyxqoo,"Even worse than the celebs, I'm tired of every Joe Schmoe ""influencer"" coming out with their own makeup or collab or whatever. Giant eyeroll for every new influencer palette release. I was entertained by Jaclyn Hill's lipstick release fiasco. Just because you have X followers doesn't mean you know a thing about running a business, formulating stuff, or PR."
115,2020-02-04 22:22:10,eyxqoo,"It’s getting way overdone, especially when some celebrity beauty lines bring nothing new to the table. Fenty influenced a lot of makeup brands to expand their shade ranges when they noticed what an overwhelming amount of people finally found a shade that matched their’s. You have old, traditional brands like Estée Lauder that used to have 17 shades of light-medium, and then less than 10 for everything between medium-dark. I saw Millie’s line at Ulta and while I’m not sure if that was the brand’s intention, it seems geared to tweens/teens to get into makeup without going for a heavy makeup look. But it feels like a lot of celebrity makeup/cosmetic brands nowadays are the same palettes, same lipsticks just repackaged and re-priced."
116,2020-02-05 00:24:34,eyxqoo,"100%. 

That is why I’m super selective on what I support with my money. What made Rihanna’s line so successful from the start, was that she came out with a huge range of foundation tones and they marketed that very well. She gave a solution to a problem that we all have - finding the perfect match for our skin.

And with Selena Gomez, eh, never thought of her as someone that has great makeup looks. We’ll see how she markets her line and what will make it stand out from the over saturation there is in the industry."
117,2020-02-04 23:16:08,eyxqoo,"I'm also finding that we aren't using all of our products in different and interesting ways because it's just SO EASY to buy new. There's so much out there, and yet most of it goes off before it can be used."
118,2020-02-04 22:48:24,eyxqoo,Makeup lines are the new album releases by actors/movies from singers.
119,2020-02-04 23:49:07,eyxqoo,"Honestly! I got a $150 gift card for Sephora and like two years ago I would've been so hyped abt that but now ??? Makeup is all the same, not inspired by anything out rn"
120,2020-02-05 00:18:12,eyxqoo,I feel the makeup fatigue as well. I've actually returned to some drugstore favorites. Cover girl foundation and maybelline mascara. Honestly I've tried and $$paid$$ for a lot of premium makeup and I'm just over it.
121,2020-02-05 01:12:44,eyxqoo,This is definitely a missed opportunity to name it Glowmez.

125,2020-02-05 00:01:31,eyxqoo,"They're huge money, so it isn't going to stop any time soon. Basically every celeb has a fragrance and this to me feels the same. I think if there's effort put in and it's something they give a shit about (or are willing to hire experts who give a shit) it's fine- MBB's line was so panned it probably won't last, and makeup lines go under all the time, so I have no problem with them trying. The good ones will usually rise to the top."
126,2020-02-05 00:10:08,eyxqoo,"I generalllly don't buy influencer/celebrity makeup. I don't know. I'm a bit exhausted with all the new launches. I think that if a celebrity does start their own line though, they need to have an edge for me to be attracted. It feels like a lot of the products just come out of the same factories and are similar."
127,2020-02-04 22:47:42,eyxqoo,Yes I was just thinking this the other day. There are so many companies and palettes now that it is too much. I try to read this sub and get a feel for what are the best brands then buy from them.
128,2020-02-05 01:19:53,eyxqoo,"I don’t think the problem is that it’s makeup, but that it’s the same as everything else. I get that you can only make so many x color of eyeshadows, but there are things I think missing, like an epic duo chrome pallet, a cream shadow pallet. Or even single shadow pallets with a beautiful esthetic. I just think there is for sure a market, it’s just the same releases on repeat that get boring. I don’t care who makes it, I just want something  different, new textures and formulas, a well thought out design, etc"
129,2020-02-05 05:06:11,eyxqoo,"Remember perfume and celebrities? Back in the 1990s and 2000s, it seemed like every pop star had their own perfume. I'd bet that most of them had no experience in fragrance or chemistry. But hey, it sold. 

Do I believe Britney Spears and Justin Bieber were were sitting in a lab somewhere trying to formulate the perfect scent? God no. But half the girls I knew had a teal bottle of Curious on their dresser. 

Make up is a brilliant idea. You can only buy so many bottles of perfume in a year, but you can always use more makeup. 

And if it's not the celebrity that sells it, then it's the franchise. Look a Harry Potter palette. A Disney palette. Are these new colors that have never existed in the spectrum before? No, not really. But put them together with a theme and you've got a hit. People eat that up."
130,2020-02-05 00:25:20,eyxqoo,I've also grown tired of makeup after the market saturation reached a certain point a couple years back. it's been so overwhelming. not to mention the prices of most of it has just been beyond my budget so I can't even get excited about trying anything.
131,2020-02-05 00:31:15,eyxqoo,"As annoyed/fatigued as I am with the industry as a whole, my wallet is so happy lol 😂 I’m really hoping to continue only rebuying products I love, like foundation, face wash, sponges, etc. Only two YouTubers got me last year with their palette launches, but that’s because they partnered with brands that I already trusted/enjoyed. I was intrigued by others, but not enough to buy anything."
132,2020-02-05 09:52:47,eyxqoo,"Am I the only one who’s really bothered by all the plastic waste being accumulated by all of these makeup lines being constantly launched? Unless you’re presenting something original and refreshing, yet another makeup line entering the market is not necessary. Celebrities can’t just do collabs anymore?"
133,2020-02-05 02:40:31,eyxqoo,The world does not need another highlighter .
134,2020-02-05 01:13:42,eyxqoo,"I don’t understand the need everyone feels to own all these celebrity makeup products. I hate wasting money but love makeup, so I have two pallets (one neutral and one colourful) and that does me just fine! I’m excited for Selena’s new line though because the concept sounds refreshing. Loving her take on beauty and makeup being for you, not others. Hoping she has some nice products"
135,2020-02-05 02:26:11,eyxqoo,"I definitely think so. My new year resolution was to not buy any new makeup because I barely get excited for the new stuff coming out anymore. It's getting very stagnant and no one's really as creative anymore. The only makeup line I get excited about is Melt Cosmetics. Their palettes are ridiculously saturated and they have bright unique colours that show up on my dark skin in one swipe. I feel like makeup newbies still have something to get excited about, but as a self proclaimed makeup addict, everything else is just meh."
136,2020-02-05 06:12:24,eyxqoo,"Yes,  there's too much of it 

 The only things I'll be buying consistently: mascara, powder, primer, and lipstick (obviously as replacements). 

I have enough highlighter, palettes, and blush to last for years.  I'm kind of just over it, I'm just glad I don't wear foundation, those usually run high."
137,2020-02-05 11:23:34,eyxqoo,"Oversaturated for sure, but I'm glad Posh Spice got in there with her own line. Her eyeshadows are FIRE."
138,2020-02-05 01:39:45,eyxqoo,"Honestly, I only buy the make-up that I truly like and I genuinely feel interested in once I see the package, colors and final products. 

It has become an over-saturated market but at the same time, there’s an extensive variety for different types of people! 

Maybe, try not to feel like you necessarily gotta buy all of it just because you’re into make-up,  just buy what you absolutely love, and enjoy it while it lasts lol. 

Edit: I fixed some typos that this comment had since I’m posting from my phone."
139,2020-02-05 01:46:13,eyxqoo,I love makeup! Collecting it is my hobby. I don’t wear it nearly as much as I once did. I’m also a complete snob. Buying the next big brand is not my thing. I stick to my favorite brands that I know  are worth the spend. Testing new lines is exhausting and tend to be wasteful for me.
140,2020-02-05 03:39:07,eyxqoo,"The amount of celeb makeup brands is over  broad, however, if the certain celebrity is *passionate* about makeup or starting anew brand (like Fenty, or Victoria Beckham) then I’m down. 

Many, and most, companies are cash grabs. Let’s be honest, but if there are somewhat good interiors or creative/passion for the products it deserves recognition. It’s hard to saw of Selena’s line with hit the mark, since I never saw her makeup inspiring.

I think right now it’s kind of a trend that Kylie Jenner and Rihanna pushed. I won’t be surprised if fashion brands become just as popular among celebrities (already is starting), or easy, targetable markets."
141,2020-02-05 03:41:42,eyxqoo,I think makeup in general has become an oversaturated market. I also feel disinterested because I can't keep up lol
142,2020-02-05 05:56:38,eyxqoo,"I doubt most will still be around in a few years. Remember when making a fragrance was the big thing? Britney was one of the first.. then you had everyone from Jessica Simpson to SJP to Paris Hilton.

The celebs are still pumping them out too! But I think a lot of the older ones that weren’t as successful are no longer around. I imagine the same for makeup."
143,2020-02-05 01:46:42,eyxqoo,"Honestly, I haven’t bought a new foundation or eyeshadow palette in two years. Makeup is supposed to add to your beauty, so I only use a little. Eyeshadow can be used in so many different combinations and ways. I think that you just find something that works, and stick to it haha."
144,2020-02-05 02:39:35,eyxqoo,"I find it interesting that there is a lot of negativity here around Millie’s line, and (aside from some obvious stupid mistakes, like the skincare video) I think that is probably indicative of the age of this sub. 

Her line is not appealing at all to me, personally. But I think she is SO smart to be one of the first brands out there that is specifically targeting Gen Z. They’re growing in spending power every year. I think that we’re going to see a lot of brands start to pop up that emulate this in the next year or two. It’s selling very well because it targets the right market. 

In general, I’m okay with a celeb line if it has a point of view/personality and is interesting. I love VB’s line - I think it’s so well done. Fenty is a powerhouse. Lady Gaga has failed at hers because she lacked those things. I don’t love Selena’s branding so far, but am curious to see what her angle is."
145,2020-02-05 02:51:27,eyxqoo,"Definitely over saturated sector but I can say I do like what Selena’s line stand for which is about makeup that show the uniqueness rather than trying to look like everyone else. 

There are way too many influencers and celebrities with makeup lines that all focus on this heavy face makeup and they all have that same Kardashian/Jenner/influencer makeup aesthetic (if you knowI’m saying) . But I feel like hers seems like a more fresh face, use make up the way you want to, without conforming. So I’m excited to see what her line has to offer."
146,2020-02-05 01:47:51,eyxqoo,"I feel like the industry in general is oversaturated with the exact same products over and over and over to the point I dont even need to buy anything anymore, I have everything I could ever need in 4-6 palettes I've accumulated over a few years (lol @ my expired makeup I def still use every now and then whoops). If I need brights, I have 2 good palettes, nudes, browns, and plums take up the rest. It's almost impossible to find something that stands out and at this point I feel like celebs don't care about quality, and I would say the same about most YouTube MUAs too. It's just getting boring at this point because they're all releasing the same stuff and wont stop releasing the same stuff, even when begged by their audience."
147,2020-02-05 02:59:18,eyxqoo,I definitely find celeb brands to be overrated. There's always a shit ton of hype and the products don't often wow me.
148,2020-02-05 04:23:09,eyxqoo,"I don’t get why she announced it so far in advance. Gaga did this too and legit everyone forgot about it and then it dropped and the reaction wasn’t explosive it was just “huh, I forgot that was going to happen!”"
149,2020-02-05 08:20:18,eyxqoo,"I’ve always loved Selena Gomez and think she’s the most gorgeous girl ever, but when I saw she was coming out with a makeup line my first thought was “...really”.  Especially when she named it after her newly released album- seems weird to me. I sincerely hope that her brand is good though, I lose respect for people who release products just for the heck of it. Fenty Beauty and Tati Beauty are two brands that I can think of that really seem like a lot of passion went into them and a lot of effort, and I personally use their products and love them. Allie Glines just released a makeup bag today, which I think is awesome and I am thinking of purchasing. At the end of the day it’s really obvious when a product is well thought out and when it isn’t, and I’m hoping Selena’s brand is good because I love her and would hate to lose respect for her lol. She’s really gonna have to release something innovative or unique for me to be on board."
150,2020-02-05 09:43:11,eyxqoo,"I think the over saturation of makeup is helping me buy less tbh. When there were less releases and more hyped up products, there was this 'gotta collect them all' mentality. Nowadays even once over hyped brands are not as popular because they're releasing too much (I'm looking at you abh) and people have stopped 'collecting' their palettes because it's no longer feasible (if it ever was). 

There's so much competition now that brands and people need to be making the best quality products. The most standout products to catch people's eyes."
151,2020-02-05 10:03:27,eyxqoo,"I started buying less but better quality - I have my go to products that might cost more but don't spark any rush of ""I NEED TO BUY THIS"" fomo effect. I'm quite happy with my small collection as it is and I haven't used it up yet as of almost 3 years. I don't see or feel the need to have yet another nude palette just because someone slapped their trademark on it. Also it saves a fuckton of money. No one cares nor knows if you have HAUS, Chanel or Essence red lipstick - as long as it looks nice it's all people would see. A red lipstick"
152,2020-02-05 14:02:57,eyxqoo,"I will support any celebrity that is genuinely intrested in the process of make up, Involved on how its made and what value it brings the consumer. Unfortunately a lot of celebrities are just slapping their brand on and give not a single care in the world what is in their products or how it could harm/ affect the consumer. That is why I usually stick to make up brands that show they have a genuine intrest in what the consumer wants, high quality products and there is research to backup on why they have chosen their products."
153,2020-02-05 03:43:11,eyxqoo,"Millie didn’t just create a makeup line- she created a skincare line. It’s honestly really smart marketing, targeting the teen demographic of her followers, and her whole “brand” is self love and acceptance, which is perfect for Florence By Mills, with lots of sayings about loving the skin your in and how self care is important."
154,2020-02-05 03:52:07,eyxqoo,"This is why I’ve been switching to indie brands. While there is always a risk as you cannot swatch in person prior to purchasing, by watching videos of swatches I’ve been very happy with almost everything I have bought. 
Not all indie makeup is cheap, and wait times for shipping can be over a month as many products are made by hand. However, as this thread is pointing out, I’ve just gotten overwhelmed and frustrated at the over saturation of makeup releases. Also, if I’m going to spend money on makeup, I would rather it go for quality versus paying for advertising and a brand name. 
My favorite indie purchases so far: 

Clionadh stained glass eye shadows 

JD Glow highlighter (shades Marilyn and Chaos) 

Terra Moon eyeshadows"
155,2020-02-05 02:07:57,eyxqoo,"I mean, ya"
156,2020-02-05 03:19:50,eyxqoo,"I do feel overwhelmed with just so much new makeup being released in general. But, as long as the quality is good, I don't mind."
157,2020-02-05 05:17:11,eyxqoo,"The makeup industry is one of the few least practical markets. Makeups aren't organized by functions in sections. Instead they are arbitrarily placed mostly based on brands, but even brands can be all over the place in the store. Not oversaturated at all, just a few big companies making everything. Package things a little differently and sell it as a different product. It's actually not very different from the fashion industry in terms of competition, branding, and logistics, probably a lot of the same people too."
158,2020-02-05 05:31:38,eyxqoo,"I would be interested in Gwen Stefani's line P8nt if it ever came out. What you waiting for? Lol My luck it would not be vegan like her UD collab palette, so I wouldn't get it anyway."
159,2020-02-05 07:55:06,eyxqoo,I feel the same. Too many celebrities hopping on the cash wagon and coming out with shitty products no one needs (\*cough\* haus labs)
160,2020-02-05 09:39:22,eyxqoo,"I guess it's just me but there are some of these who I don't feel they have a real passion for their clients. Like The Honest Line(Jessica Alba), she seems so sincere. I really like Meaningful Beauty (Cindy Crawford), Dr Landers (Candace Cameron)..I am just picky and  typically don't trust celebs much anymore. I don't like the hate and condescending hypocrisy of some.  I think I can find plenty with professional cosmeticians and natural chemists."
161,2020-02-05 09:43:44,eyxqoo,I thought the same thing when I saw the announcement for Rare Beauty. Even not celebrity makeup brands seem to be oversaturating the market with release after release of new new new. And now with celebrities starting their own brands it does seem like a lot. It's kind of a turn off to me personally as a consumer.
162,2020-02-05 09:47:08,eyxqoo,Can't wait for Justin beibers skincare line. 😂
163,2020-02-05 10:33:02,eyxqoo,"Gomez is just tryna stay relevant since 13 Reasons Why isn't popular anymore, guarantee you her makeup line is gonna flop. No one will give it the time of day, unless it sucks in which case everyone will blast it."
164,2020-02-05 11:12:55,eyxqoo,"I totally agree with you! I don't even use make-up that often but when I try getting into it, like when purchasing a new palette I feel so overwhelmed and just go back to my old stuff. I would love to experiment a lot more, but like you said makeup sector is oversaturated."
165,2020-02-05 11:16:17,eyxqoo,"I am actually very excited for this one. Selena has always been a big part of my life as a Gen Z kid. I basically frew up with her, not to mention that she is literally so drop dead gorgeous. I have literally been a fan since I first saw her, and honestly I feel like this is going to be a good line. I wouldn’t expect anything less from her, I am honestly expecting a natural line of products but we will see. Nonetheless I am super stoked for this one."
166,2020-02-05 17:47:17,eyxqoo,It's always gonna be a massive thing from here on out as it's what women rely on more than anything else.
167,2020-02-05 00:33:47,eyxqoo,Absolutely. I (a guy) still love makeup but I’ve started to ignore a lot because there’s just too much. Haven’t bought anything major like a palette in almost two years. Don’t see that changing anytime soon.
168,2020-02-05 04:07:46,eyxqoo,"I think its good. I remember back  in 2007 there were only a couple of big cosmetic companies. This is before NYX blew up. It was MAC, Urban Decay and Revlon. This was way back when Temptalia didn't even have her blog/ Then after the beauty YT blew up there were soooooo many new brands to try and it was no longer monopolized.

&#x200B;

I think competition works for the consumers favor. Now  we have so many to choose from and it definitely is a good thing. I dont have to spend $44 on Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer, there we like 20+ to choose from at every price point. Yes, there is good and bad  with all the new companies. Yes, ABH and colourpop does a colab with every single person on YT. I think its mostly good tho. we have so many options and back in early 2000s it wasnt like that"
169,2020-02-04 22:55:28,eyxqoo,"Thank god I don’t care about celeb makeup..it never draws me in and I can continue to lose money on overbuying products I already have cuz I’m honestly petrified of ever running out of products >_>. Like, I’m busy."

171,2020-02-05 01:47:51,eyxqoo,"I’m finding that there’s a lot of product out there, but no real difference to each other. 

I think that’s why everyone went crazy over the Jeffree Star X Shane Dawson collab, it was a new, fresh idea of what makeup can be."
172,2020-02-05 04:03:28,eyxqoo,"I think there’s room for more of the celebrities in question A. Pay attention to their target demographics and B. Bring something special to the table (this goes for all makeup brands really).

Rihanna is so clearly passionate and involved with her makeup brand, and keeps bringing something new to the table, such as her iconic shade range, and usually does so with good quality. Even the snap shadow palettes, while iffy in quality, were still a unique idea!

And as much as I’m not a Kardashian fan, Kylie cosmetics knows it’s customers and consistently puts out cute, quality releases.

Lady Gaga is the other end of the spectrum. She had so much promise of both diverse and unique makeup, and then released 4 white girl nude lip sets and an obligatory red. Liquid eyeshadows might have been breaking the mold 5 years ago, but right now everyone has them and in better formulas and colors too. It was so underwhelming and not at all what people hoped for from her. She just put very safe, low quality choices in edgy packaging like people wouldn’t notice. 

Brands that insist on putting out played out item, especially when the celebrity face clearly doesn’t care about the product either, are definitely over saturated. Brands that actually put in work, ensure quality and a unique style, all while having the founder actively represent the brand can still find room."
173,2020-02-05 01:10:29,eyxqoo,"I find these posts to be so annoying. Who the hell cares if there are a billion makeup lines? Is \*this\* what is taking up space in your mind? Who the hell cares? Just don't buy it and move on. 

I feel just as annoyed when people post about colourpop and it's gazillion launches. Who the hell cares?! It's not important."
174,2020-02-05 11:45:28,eyxqoo,"You don't have to keep up if you don't want to.


Do you like what's already on your table? Good. No need to buy new just because a celeb made it.


Matter if fact you can use what you already have to dupe the celeb makeup. It requires  good color vision, but I had a whole YouTube series on how to make crayon lipgloss dupes of Kylie cosmetics in your own home"
175,2020-02-05 00:11:44,eyxqoo,"Yes, Rihanna's line really reflects her personality. She does minimal releases and the quality is on point. That's the way to do a celebrity makeup line if they want to do one. 

Being a celebrity will get you initial sales, but if they are going to charge Sephora prices for their line they need to have the quality and aesthetic to back it up. Otherwise customers will just feel let down and will be unlikely to buy anything from them again. Not to mention it will reflect poorly on them in general. It's really not something a celebrity should do unless they love it and are committed to doing it right despite their already busy schedules.

Edit: I don't know anything about Selena Gomez's line, but she seems pretty savvy. I think she'll probably do a good job."
176,2020-02-04 23:11:21,eyxqoo,Gaga should be the replacement for KVD in the market in terms of artistic effort and edge.
177,2020-02-05 00:24:26,eyxqoo,"I feel like the only celebrity make up line that's actually worth it is Fenty. It has the authenticity, dedication, and quality that all other celeb brands lack."
178,2020-02-05 00:03:41,eyxqoo,"Completely spot on. 

I really like the aesthetic VB's line; those smoky eye bricks are VB in a pan. Too expensive for me to justify, but definitely lovely. Same with Lisa Eldridge."
179,2020-02-05 00:18:52,eyxqoo,"I actually just took a peek on the Haus Labs website and I’m a lot more impressed than I was originally. The original promo photos were okay, but it reminded me way too much of the 80’s glam rock days and yes, the eyeshadow palette is just straight up boring and uninspired.

But she has some cool products like reusable cat eye stickers that come in different sizes/shapes and apparently blend in seamlessly with her eyeliner. And another sticker set that creates a masquerade ball-look. I’m not into liquid eyeshadows at all, but she has created an extensive collection with unique colors that I haven’t seen from other brands before (there’s probably a bunch out there, I just haven’t seen any brands spend much time on marketing their liquid shadows or heard influencers or even non-influencers talk about them much). 

Shrug. I had expected more from Lady Gaga’s original launch, but it looks like this is just the beginning. Hopefully she takes it up a notch and gives us something truly unique."
180,2020-02-05 00:07:07,eyxqoo,"True maybe more was expected from her first launch, but in the video she did with NikkieTutorials she explained the inspiration behind the palette (and the brand as a whole). IIRC it was the shades she used to throw on really quick when she was performing in bars, or something like that. Plus, Lady Gaga is now known for a lot more than her whacky outfits."
181,2020-02-05 04:36:46,eyxqoo,Yes!!!! I get so bored seeing the same nude palettes being essentially resold under a different celeb name. I hope Selena makes hers unique.
182,2020-02-05 07:22:47,eyxqoo,It reminds me of the Gwen Stefani collab w UD that was all classic/neutrals
183,2020-02-04 22:03:35,eyxqoo,"Yes, makeup fatigue is a real thing. I think this also parallels with my goals for 2020. I want to live more sustainably and not buy an excess amount of makeup that will just sit around and eventually get thrown out because it’s expired. I’m trying to only repurchase when I’m actually out of a foundation, mascara..etc. I’m also trying to save more this year and not just throw money at the hottest makeup trend or item that month."
184,2020-02-05 04:51:20,eyxqoo,"To be fair, at least Millie's brand is appealing to a certain demographic (pre-teens and teenagers). Im sure as hell not buying it but it's not meant for me."

186,2020-02-05 04:38:43,eyxqoo,"HOWEVER— someone like Tina Yong, who’s been a small business owner and certified makeup artist for a decade or two, is much more trustworthy I feel. Her combination palette was lovely and quite useful and I never felt like she was trying to shove anything down her followers throats at all. 

There’s definitely a right way to do something like that."

192,2020-02-05 01:58:04,eyxqoo,Totally agree... I'd be more likely to support a Selena Gomez hair-care line than makeup cos I've been envious of her hair for years lol
193,2020-02-05 08:27:20,eyxqoo,"Completely agree, I've never viewed Selena Gomez as inspiring in the makeup department. Although I'm sure getting your makeup professionally done 100 times over will give you an appreciation for the makeup industry. I think a skin care line would've suited her better because she embodies natural beauty, but we will see."
194,2020-02-05 14:09:26,eyxqoo,I honestly can't even picture Selena with a full Glam look. I feel like the most I've ever seen her do is a red lip?
195,2020-02-04 23:18:16,eyxqoo,"Yup, which creates an issue with overconsumption and waste."
196,2020-02-05 02:18:24,eyxqoo,I think you switched those up by accident
197,2020-02-05 00:29:26,eyxqoo,I'd spend it on skincare now
198,2020-02-05 00:20:35,eyxqoo,Totally agree. I got a gift card and spent it all on skin care LOL
199,2020-02-05 05:27:51,eyxqoo,"Yes! New brands are great, but I think drugstore brands have really stepped up their game in recent years. I can easily buy something for half the price of a highstreet or premium product, and it works just as well, or even better."
200,2020-02-04 23:41:58,eyxqoo,">Tati is lovely, but I think she has no idea about health , yet promotes vitamins.

Yeah, I like Tati, but these vitamins are nothing something id promote personally. Doctors always say that if you are lacking in any particular vitamin, its better to eat foods with that vitamin in it. Doctor Mike on Youtube discourages people from using vitamins, unless directed by a doctor. Plus vitamins are not regulated. They can say they have x amount of vitamin c in it, but that may not even be the case."
201,2020-02-05 01:30:48,eyxqoo,I love Revolution.
202,2020-02-05 03:59:52,eyxqoo,"Love yourself by buying my products!

Oh capitalism, you sneaky lil’ sneak."
203,2020-02-05 01:44:28,eyxqoo,Well you are in a makeup sub .
204,2020-02-05 00:12:12,eyxqoo,I think Melt might be going for that market.  Their Muerte palette is like nothing else on the market (and great).
205,2020-02-04 23:15:35,eyxqoo,Yes and she was handed the opportunity on a silver platter.  She blew it big time.
206,2020-02-04 23:19:26,eyxqoo,"This is a brilliant idea & I hope Gaga sees it, executes it, then thank yous for it!"
207,2020-02-05 02:24:12,eyxqoo,Victoria Beckham's stuff is really great too.
208,2020-02-05 05:47:45,eyxqoo,"Jeffree Star's quality is amazing, and it's mostly (all?) vegan. I don't know if he's necessarily a celeb in the way we're saying here, but he's def top tier imo."
209,2020-02-05 04:01:15,eyxqoo,I just looked up the cat eye stickers. Omg this changes everything.
210,2020-02-05 04:31:54,eyxqoo,"The interview was honestly really cool. She loves the colors and wants people to use them in their everyday shades, not just for ""fun"" looks."
211,2020-02-05 16:48:57,eyxqoo,"Gaga's always been very extra with her style and makeup.  I expected her brand to reflect that.

Releasing a blah neutral palette is as off character for her as KKW beauty releasing a rainbow palette."
212,2020-02-05 13:48:01,eyxqoo,"I think Kesha made her's unique enough (and it had rainbow and glitter in it, which is a given for her)."
213,2020-02-05 00:19:32,eyxqoo,"I'm not quite there yet, but I admire you. I am trying to focus on things I really want though. I let stuff sit in my cart for a while so I don't impulse buy anything. And if I buy something pretty I try to do something that will last like eyeshadow since I know I can sanitize that and keep it for years. I rarely buy liquid lipsticks anymore as they seem far less sanitary than a bullet lipstick I can cut the end off of. It will go bad still, but my dead lip skin won't be sitting in there for a year lol. I've been sanitizing and wiping down all my palettes and blushes which makes them look much newer and nicer and also reminds me of all the makeup I have. I also added everything in the database that I can to my vanity on Temptalia's sight so I can check for dupes I already have of things. I'll get there!"
214,2020-02-05 03:12:46,eyxqoo,"I'm just getting into makeup and clueless and the insanely huge variety and options has had me suck in analysisparalysis for a couple months. I have no idea what's good, what's a must have basic, what's the trash or a waste or not for beginners and so on.

And the pricing doesn't help on a lot of this stuff..."
215,2020-02-05 01:56:10,eyxqoo,I’m doing the same thing :)
216,2020-02-05 11:52:44,eyxqoo,"Very true. 

The worsening quality of my skin pushed me to take a break from makeup in 2015. 
Next thing you know its October and I haven't worn any foundation, voncealer  , blush ect for the year ...



And I'm stretching out wearing any makeup on my face by 2 weeks at a time



I still follow that routeen and my skin is smoother"
217,2020-02-08 15:09:55,eyxqoo,Millies line gives me a glossier vibe but available in person. Ive actually thought about trying it since I perfer very minimal natural makeup & thats what she seems to cater to.
218,2020-02-05 01:51:45,eyxqoo,"I didn’t know it existed until I saw a display at ulta, the marketing was amazing for young girls (tweens / teens). If I had a daughter or was that age myself I would definitely gravitate towards it. I was honestly impressed."
219,2020-02-05 07:28:18,eyxqoo,"I bought the Tina Yong palette even though I have mostly stopped watching her (no shade, just got bored of a lot of makeup videos) because the colours were so different from almost everything that was coming out last year. 

It has ended up being my favourite palette I've purchased in the last few years. The quality is so good and if I'm travelling, I only have to take that one palette and I can do several different looks.

Sorry to gush. I really love it but I never see anyone talking about it."
220,2020-02-05 03:59:16,eyxqoo,"Now, I'll have to look it up, bcz I don't follow anything,  but drama. lol"
221,2020-02-05 00:19:16,eyxqoo,"I mean she's a famous and successful 16 year old, she has the means to do so. Look how much Billie Eilish and many other young stars have accomplished at 16. At her age I was using products that probably did more harm than good (cleansers that stripped the skin, very abrasive scrubs etc) so props to her if it introduces teens to better products."
222,2020-02-05 00:03:28,eyxqoo,"I like the thought of taking care of your skin at a younger age, but I'm pretty sure the products are all shit solely because it seems like a kids play make up brand."
223,2020-02-05 12:26:20,eyxqoo,Totally agree! Unfortunately I am sure she cannot launch her own hair products because she has previously been in commercials for hair care brands. She totally missed out!
224,2020-02-05 00:16:54,eyxqoo,"This! Would love to see someone create a clean, sustainable beauty brand, where you can order refills of some sort, everything is sourced ethically, labor is paid fairly, and it does not come in so much plastic. 
In addition to it being available in-store so that it helps not create such a huge carbon footprint, as opposed to everyone having to order exclusively online."
225,2020-02-05 02:23:46,eyxqoo,"I watched a short video the other day about recycling makeup packaging. Apparently a lot of it is too small to be recognised by the scanners and ends up in landfill. As well as this, the light used to scan items bounces off packaging that is black, which also means it gets sent to landfill. So we recycle and it doesn't do any good"
226,2020-02-05 02:23:17,eyxqoo,"I mean actors who release a music single/album and singers who star in film/tv as a way to expand their career. Instead of putting out a terrible song, celebrities just put out a terrible makeup line."
227,2020-02-05 00:37:24,eyxqoo,"Honestly, I should, but there is still a massive part of me that resists spending more than $20 on a product for skincare haha"
228,2020-02-05 04:12:02,eyxqoo,"There's USP and NSF certification you can look for! It's a little symbol on the label. A lot of Nature Made will have USP certification, for example. It's pretty frustrating to stand in the aisle for half an hour looking at labels, just to find a Vitamin D3 that's USP certified. I wish they would have mandatory certification for all supplements."
229,2020-02-05 01:48:25,eyxqoo,The Muerte palette disappoints me only because of the cluster of dark shades in the center of the palette. There just wasn’t enough variation in shade/tone. I think adding a a muted coral would have looked amazing with the other shades. The red and greens are gorgeous though.
230,2020-02-05 02:03:29,eyxqoo,Very true !
231,2020-02-05 11:55:36,eyxqoo,"This! I bought a few things (buying into hype, I guess) but the packaging is amazing, the colors seem well thought out, and they're unlike anything I have in my collection. 

A lot of people complain about price, but she is *Posh* Spice, after all."
232,2020-02-05 06:01:45,eyxqoo,"He's definitely super famous, but I'd recognize him as makeup brand turned celebrity than celebrity turned makeup brand"
233,2020-02-05 11:06:14,eyxqoo,Jeffree Star is also complete and utter trash.
234,2020-02-05 12:45:58,eyxqoo,"Why are you being downvoted for this?!

I dont understand reddit sometimes."
235,2020-02-05 11:54:19,eyxqoo,"I'm pretty sure it's all vegan. And it's bloody amazing! I love Jeffree, but I wish I had more money to buy his products. But his eyeshadows and lipsticks are out of this world!"
236,2020-02-05 04:32:33,eyxqoo,Omg seriously I need these now!!!
237,2020-02-05 08:20:59,eyxqoo,"Exactly, it was really great and you can see her passion for the brand. She isn't as known for bright multicoloured make-up looks as someone like Jeffree Star is, in fact a lot if the time her make-up is very classic, sometimes with a slight twist."
238,2020-02-06 07:07:54,eyxqoo,"Yeah, Keshas is very unique and I love it haha. I was referring more to lady gaga and mbbs palettes and such. Also Id like to add, I think selenas line isnt a cash grab because shes been working on it for so long (since before the celeb makeup line trend) and hired professionals in the field."
239,2020-02-05 06:16:54,eyxqoo,"Every time you get into a hobby, it’s the same. At first I was lost in the make-up world too, two years later, I can rec products to anyone. However, I’m getting into skincare and I feel overwhelmed again lol. Never ending circle, with so much to learn."
240,2020-02-05 05:43:09,eyxqoo,"Honestly? Ipsy bag or other makeup service. $10 for the sample bag, $25 for the big one. Lots of things to test and play with! 

You can budget easily and if you find something you really like, you can go out and buy it!"
241,2020-02-05 00:19:43,eyxqoo,"If I recall correctly, Jackie Aina reviewed them and they were okay but WAY overpriced, especially for a teen audience."
242,2020-02-05 00:22:14,eyxqoo,"Unless you work in the field of skincare, I don't care for your skincare line. Especially for a 16 year, who probably doesn't even use her own skincare line. Reminds me of Kylie Jenner too...."
243,2020-02-05 04:36:52,eyxqoo,I like the idea of Colourpop’s magnetic pallets that fit individual refill pans. You don’t have to buy a whole new palette when you pan one single shadow.
244,2020-02-05 08:51:50,eyxqoo,Kjaer Weiss does the refill thing. Almost everything is in a pan as far as I can remember. It's quite expensive and I haven't tried it but I know they're at least one doing it.
245,2020-02-05 05:26:23,eyxqoo,"I don't think it can go in with your average single stream recycling but a few companies offer recycling programs - Bare Minerals, Origins stores/counters and I'm pretty sure Back to Mac gets recycled."
246,2020-02-05 04:05:29,eyxqoo,"Ha, it used to be perfume.

Although I love gaga's liquid eyeshadows 🙃"
247,2020-02-05 05:04:37,eyxqoo,Perfume?
248,2020-02-05 01:55:32,eyxqoo,"I""m glad there's not a coral simply because coral looks terrible on me (I can't do anything that has the slightest hint of warm tones).  I took a hard pass on Vida because it's pretty much all warm.  They have a new one coming out that does have a coral in it (I like it, I will swatch it, but I can probably dupe it within my collection.

I will also typically use more than one palette to do a look so not having everything doesn't bother me. 

Normally a shade or 2 that doesn't work for me doesn't bother me.  But for a $58 palette, I want to be able to use all the shades.  For a $7 Primark palette, not so much."
249,2020-02-05 11:53:07,eyxqoo,He was actually quite famous back in the day with his music. But I would say he rediscovered fame after he started up his makeup line.
250,2020-02-05 11:25:23,eyxqoo,I guess I don't understand the down votes and why why he's trash. My SIL buys nothing but JS and we love it. What makes him or it so trashy?
251,2020-02-05 13:23:02,eyxqoo,"More about the general sentiment towards him than his product, I'd guess."
252,2020-02-05 07:18:15,eyxqoo,"You can recycle beauty, skincare, and haircare empties from any brand at l’Occitane boutiques (and they’ll give you 10% off one item) 😊"
253,2020-02-05 04:50:51,eyxqoo,"You're so right about that. I was never super into fragrance so I don't know much about what's out there, but I feel like I see lots of celebrity-branded perfume on sale all the time. Lots of these products aren't even bad per se; there's too many of them, though! I can't keep up. Just wish there was more imagination lately 😔"
254,2020-02-05 10:12:42,eyxqoo,"Shit, you just made me realize that makeup palettes are the old celeb fragrances!

Disclaimer before you read any further: I'm a passive observer of the makeup industry. This means that I may be wrong about some points and I understand completely if you choose to point them out to me.

But why is it that everyone release the same product? If someone comes out with fragrance, another should bring out a makeup palette, another hair care, another skin care, another shoes, and so on. I mean, I get it - celebs are competing against each other for mindshare, but:

1) if I buy A's makeup, my chances of buying B's makeup are going to be lesser. Maybe I'm a makeup fiend, so I do buy both. But then I'll buy everyone else's as well. I won't be loyal to just one celeb's product so I won't be likely to recommend one over the other.

2) if different celebs bring out different products, people are more likely to buy them all more just because we need more products in different categories than more in the same category.

3) are the colors of different makeup palettes REALLY that different? Here is where my ignorance may shine through. But this is a question that pops into my mind every time an influencer comes out with a palette. I think, ""How many blue eyeshadows do I need in my life?"" At this point, someone may point out the famous ""Cerulean Blue"" dialogue from Devil Wears Prada. But I still don't understand it as much as I would like to. 

3a) If you say the quality may differ, I would say this: someone who has the financial resources that a Selena or a Lady Gaga has would not compromise on quality. Jaclyn can compromise because she is not a world-renown celeb. Her reach is limited to her YouTube and Instagram followers and people in the makeup field. It may be a huge pool of people, but definitely not as large as the kind of pool of fans that these celebs have. If they mess up, it's going to be all over the news and a PR nightmare, since it could be dangerous, health-wise."
255,2020-02-06 20:20:35,eyxqoo,I would massively disagree. He was medium famous in a very niche subculture.
256,2020-02-05 12:04:18,eyxqoo,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffree_Star#Racism
257,2020-02-06 06:32:47,eyxqoo,"Oh that's helpful because Bare Minerals & Origins I think are primarily for cosmetics & skincare, but not for haircare product packaging!"
258,2020-02-05 05:16:42,eyxqoo,"And celebrity perfumes all smell the same too! It's always the sweet, floral or vanilla or coconut scent. Not that it's bad, but like you said, I wished there was more variety and creativity instead of being an obvious cash-grab.


Sorta reminds me of that time when I read how Elizabeth Taylor would make perfumes that she herself would wear. There's a photo of her dressing table somewhere and she's got all her perfumes there. I thought that was pretty neat."
259,2020-02-04 21:35:41,eyxdbp,Someone else posted this! Sorry
260,2020-02-04 21:26:17,eyxdbp,5 years too late Selena
261,2020-02-04 21:29:08,eyxdbp,"I wish celebrities would stop trying to get into the beauty industry but I totally understand the appeal of an effective short term investment. That being said I only see Fenty Beauty as a solid brand that will last longer than say, Ke$ha, Selena, Lady Gaga, Millie Bobby Brown brands. I find it more of a thought out brand that is not releasing products for the sake of it and has that interest in creating innovative products. 

Even I (not the target audience, I was interested when I was in college lol) feel Kylie Cosmetics is getting less hype and attention but with the new co-owner I believe they’ll be able to reach international outlets which is a largely untapped market."
262,2020-02-04 21:26:41,eyxdbp,Ughhhh no. Make it stoppp
263,2020-02-04 21:30:12,eyxdbp,"This better be so extraordinary or am not interested, there are too many brands around"
264,2020-02-04 21:31:13,eyxdbp,Omg make it stop. There’s too much.
265,2020-02-04 21:35:55,eyxdbp,"Every celebrity/mua/youtuber is coming out with a new makeup line, and there’s just way too much saturation in the market. If this was even 4-5 years ago, it would be a much a bigger deal, but I’m not even surprised or excited for products, where the only difference will be new packaging with her name on it."
266,2020-02-04 21:39:42,eyxdbp,"I'm just so tired of all these new brands coming out. The market is so saturated, I just want to stick with what I know. I'm sure others feel the same way. I'd rather buy a collaboration with a celebrity I like."
267,2020-02-04 21:34:31,eyxajz,Removed for duplicate post sorry!
268,2020-02-04 21:20:55,eyxajz,All these brand launches are making me genuinely exhausted lmao
269,2020-02-04 21:22:33,eyxajz,The market is sooo saturated. What products are there that we dont already have?
270,2020-02-04 21:24:22,eyxajz,Ah shit here we go again

272,2020-02-04 21:26:39,eyxajz,5 YEARS TOO LATE SELENA DAMN
273,2020-02-04 21:32:02,eyxajz,"i'm not bothered when celebrities launch a makeup line,no one is making me buy anything from them.  i have stuff from Fenty and think that's all the celebrity based cosmetics i own."
274,2020-02-04 21:33:58,eyxajz,"I feel if it’s going to be in Sephora there’s a chance she’s launching something through Kendo. Last time I heard of a brand starting it’s launch in Sephora we got Fenty. I’m curious as I know she’s big into fashion which is more what I would have expected from her, but we’ll see."
275,2020-02-04 22:57:27,eyxajz,"Just what we need, another celebrity makeup brand... yayy..."

I've never been a big fan of hers, but I have to admit she has a pretty nice ass. This makes her the prime choice for this category. Plus: she kind of strikes me as the most likely to actually *enjoy* a hard and rough anal pounding, so there's that.

I have a sneaking suspicion that this is also the same guy who was banned from either this subreddit or that one a month or two ago, just with a new account this time.

I'll be totally convinced it's the same guy if his posts start getting more and more depraved, with extreme bondage, actual porn images, and some seriously out-there fetish choices.

**We've had to disallow ageplay to stay in compliance with Reddit's sitewide rules against sexually suggestive content involving minors.**

Your post used the word **Teen** which triggered this post to be removed. If your post isn't about ageplay you can either report this post for any reason to have mods review it and approve it or just repost without the word Teen in it. 

**However if this is about ageplay we take it very seriously and reposting ageplay content will result in a quick and immediate ban.**
  
This is a copy of the original post:

Hi redditors,

So here's the deal I'm looking to setup a roleplay where you would play as a r34 character, I have preferences, but if you have one that I know of that you really want to play that's fine by me.

We would start by setting up the roleplay, brainstorming about what kind of relationship we'd have and so on and so forth.

Now to my preferences, note that they might change if I come to think of someone else that i had forgotten

Anime:

All Dragonball girls.

All My Hero Acadamia girls

Misty, May and Flannery from Pokèmon

Sora and Kari from Digimon

Cartoons:

Kim Possible, Bonnie and Monique

Velma

Nani from Lilo and Stitch

Gwen Tennyson from Ben 10

Sam and Alex from Totally Spies

Brandi Harington from Brandi and Mr Whiskers

Any of the girls in Sonic the Hedgehog

Ashoka from Star wars 

Raven, Jinx and Starfire from Teen Titans

Games:

Tali, Miranda, FemShep, Liara, Peebee, Vetra and Jack from Mass Effect 

Undyne and Alphys from Undertale

Ciri and Triss from The Witcher

Kasumi and Ayane from Dead or Alive

Ellie from the Last of Us.

Tristana, Lulu, Jinx and Poppy from League of Legends.

Celebrities:

Mia Khalifa
Emma Watson
Selena Gomez
Miley Cyrus
Debby Ryan
Ashley Tisdale
Brenda Song
Emily Osment
Miranda Cosgrove
Jeanette Mccurdy
Ariana Grande
Victoria Justice

And that's the list for now, note that I'm not telling you to play all the characters from a single show, but I do also not mind if you want to do that.

And of course all characters and participants have to be 18+.

Hope to hear from you soon!

Its like a feedback loop from bands they influenced like deftones coming back around and influencing them. Inlet is almost a prog, half metal album, long songs, very shoegaze. I'm loving it."
505,2020-06-26 14:48:57,hg34hm,"I totes hear ya. On the other side of things I feel like hum is kinda niche because of their sound, so IMO it would be weird to wait 20 years for a hum record and it not sound like a hum record'

I hadn’t heard anything of Trevor’s until the collab was announced but I really enjoyed his album and have been listening to it a lot this week. I think the remix is a nice addition and hope it can score a nice little hit for each of them."

547,2020-06-26 01:40:42,hfw5tn,The guitar in the beginning reminds me a lot of the beginning of Complicated by Avril Lavigne
548,2020-06-26 11:17:51,hfw5tn,Didn’t realize this was going to be a remix of past life when I saw that they were collaborating but I’m glad they chose this song to remix. One of the better songs from his album. I do find the ohhh oh oh in the post chorus incredibly annoying but selena sounds good on it and it definetly had the most hit potential of any song from his album. Gives me soundtrack for movie based on teen novel soundtrack teas
549,2020-06-26 06:15:28,hfw5tn,I like it!
550,2020-06-27 02:37:51,hfw5tn,"Love the song, it's on repeat. Saw another comment the other day here that said it felt more like a Halsey song. I can definitely see what they meant by that with it having a slightly rockier feel, but I adore Selly's vocals so would've been pleased with either of them on the track! I think Selena sounds great on it and her softer vocals complement the rockier sound really well.

Selena Gomez, forever Queen of collabs. 👑"
551,2020-06-26 17:32:45,hfw5tn,"Wow this is a bop. Never heard of Trevor Daniel but great voice, will have to give him a listen."
552,2020-06-26 05:45:21,hfw5tn,"This is a really good remix. I listened to the song yesterday, and yeah, Selena improves it. I can hear points in the song where they comped takes together (which indicates some not great things about her studio performance), but her voice is a great fit for the song. 

The chorus still feels like it was Frankensteined together from a bunch rap influenced songs (I can place Django Jane and especially Hate Me, but I’m sure those rhythms and flows are just that common), but it’s a good start for a young artist.

Edit: This probably won’t happen because of label bullshit, but like... Selena Gomez and Post Malone would collab well. Trevor Daniel is... clearly influenced by him, but our boy Postie has had the chance to revive his style much more than Trevor (obviously, he’s been prominent for three plus years and was making music long before that)."
553,2020-06-27 02:35:08,hfw5tn,a proper duet!
554,2020-06-26 07:00:17,hfw5tn,"Couldn’t disagree more that overlapping vocals show a poor studio performance. It’s not a feature. It’s a collab. They’re supposed to share the song as evenly as possible. If voices go well together then by all means, overlap them. I wouldn’t say they’re hiding her vocals at all, this song is actually the best Selena has ever sounded in my opinion (even though it’s not my favourite song by her)."
555,2020-06-26 07:12:14,hfw5tn,"That’s not what I meant. 

I can hear the parts of the song where different vocal takes that Selena did are spliced together. And like... that’s not necessarily a bad thing (that happens with everyone), but the fact that I can hear it in the middle of phrases indicates to me that she had some issues. I mean, based on the fact that she reportedly could not do the “mmm mm mmm” bit of Look At Her Now in one take, I wouldn’t be surprised. 

But yeah, she sounds great. I just have a sharp ear for this stuff."
556,2020-06-26 07:14:59,hfw5tn,"Still disagree. The ‘mmm mm mmm’ is literally the chorus of that song so it needs to be at the perfect pitch/frequency and duration/length. Something that important doesn’t necessarily need to be done in one go. It’s a studio song, not a live song, so they’re allowed (actually encouraged) to play around with vocals and chop it up until it sounds perfect. I might argue that this would be less acceptable in ballads, where vocals are far more important."
557,2020-07-05 22:24:23,hfw5tn,are you talking about the little cut sounds whenever she says “last”? i really thought that was just me listening too hard
558,2020-07-05 23:36:29,hfw5tn,"Yep. You’re not going crazy, that’s real, and while it’s usually hidden better ~~because usually people can deliver four bars decently enough that they don’t have to cut things up in the middle of a word~~, but it’s pretty common practice."

608,2020-06-30 00:40:13,hiclp3,"I think people just hate a lot of singers anyway because their music isn't good, just to add"
609,2020-06-30 00:40:51,hiclp3,"I don't like Billie Eilish or Selena Gomez. I don't like Whitney Houston either, so.

But then, I don't listen to Billie Ellish's genre of music, nor Selena Gomez, nor Whitney Houston's. And each of those singers is a unique performance artist for their particular genre.

Whether someone's singing style is highly varied in tone and loudness versus a consistent tonality or medium range of high notes and low notes is kind of subjectively irrelevant.

If you think Leonard Cohen is a great singer, that's fine. If you think Pavoratti is a BETTER singer than Leonard Cohen, I'd say you have no basis to make that claim other than personal preferences.

A Tuvan throat singer might be the most amazing singer ***for that genre***, but if you're judging that singer against, say, Zac Effron, when it comes to American Broadway musical singing styles, that's not exactly what I'd call an objective opinion, because let's see Zac Effron use the Tuvan throat singing technique.

Likewise, calling said Tuvan throat singer the best singer ever is also ignoring the fact that for that particular genre, they're a defining performer but for every other genre? Not so much."
610,2020-06-30 00:42:41,hiclp3,"I personally like Billie Eilish. I'm not a big fan of Selena Gomez, but I think that the music they're making is pretty good. Of course that's subjective though."
611,2020-06-30 00:43:32,hiclp3,Very good point!
612,2020-06-29 22:46:04,hiai39,"> Like, why not come over and let me know you want to fool around. 

Probably because sex and masturbation are not interchangeable activities.  Despite what they have in common, they serve different purposes and require different things of a person.  Masturbation is quick and easy, and in addition to physical pleasure it mostly offers a little stress relief.  Sex is intense and involved, and at times can actually increase stress more than relieve it.  But the payoff is huge: you get a great experience with someone you care about, and you deepen your emotional intimacy with them.  If you'll pardon the analogy, sex is like making a fancy four-course dinner together, and masturbation is like nipping out for a fast-food burger.  Both are good, but neither one is really a substitute for the other.

If you're bothered by the fact that he does it while you're home, talk to him about that.  But if you are going to ask him only to masturbate while you're out, it would be a courtesy to also go out every so often to give him the chance to take care of himself; going extended periods of time without that little bit of privacy can be uncomfortable.  Likewise, you can tell him specifically that you would like a little more appreciation for your attractiveness-- it puts him in a bit of an awkward position, but it's better that he knows he's not holding up his end there than that he goes on thinking everything is fine when you're actually upset.

For what it's worth, his masturbating to pictures of celebrities probably has absolutely no relation to his perception of your attractiveness.  People with the most beautiful partners in the world will still look at pictures and videos of strangers when they masturbate.  I'm not sure why-- maybe the emotional distance of not knowing the person makes it easier to focus on their sexiness, or something-- but it really doesn't have to make you self-conscious."
613,2020-06-29 22:41:19,hiai39,I've personally never dealt with this kind of encounter but I would suggest just being open and talking to him about it. Maybe just say you want to join in or tell him how him doing it while you're at home makes you feel.
614,2020-06-29 22:57:21,hiai39,"Next time it happens, YOU go to him and tell him you want to be part of the fun. Try it."
615,2020-06-29 22:48:34,hiai39,"He really is the master bater.

Just curious but does he ever masturbate?"
616,2020-06-29 23:03:08,hiai39,"I can certainly understand the separation of the two things. Your analogy was perfect! And I don't know if I'm even that bothered by that. I do work a different shift then he does so he has plenty of time to himself, so that works out. 
I am coming to see the underlying problem seems to be that I'm feeling really insecure. To your point, I have talked to him about it several times. Tell him I'm not feeling good about myself or x,y,z and he's like, oh (seemingly affirming my feelings). Like x1 a month he will tell me I look pretty, and never anything specific. It's starting to make me feel like a needy crazy person! That's why I feel bothered by the attractive young celebs, because he probably thinks about how beautiful they are and what features he thinks are sexy. Maybe I need to get over myself?"
617,2020-06-29 23:35:49,hiai39,That's actually what I did the first time.

I've always loved pop music from all decades and had to repress a lot of that love to try to fit in as a man. I've been listening to so much femme pop lately and it makes me feel so liberated and myself. I still like some more masculine music but on the whole I think my music taste is more ""feminine"" (whatever that means) and it feels good to admit that.  My music taste is a lot more diverse now. Kim Petras Malibu video was what made me finally admit to myself that I'm trans and that's song of the year for sure!"
636,2020-06-30 08:11:17,hi7c53,"Yeah, this was totally my experience. I always loved pop songs by women but to a pretty big extent was ''ashamed'' of admitting it to the wider world. The degree to which depended on the song.  Embracing that love has been great."

641,2020-06-29 20:41:12,hi7c53,"That statement itself is even more.. tone deaf and frankly far more insidiously racist than just not liking pop music but that’s an entirely different conversation from the one we’re having.

Black people being a foundation of most, if not all, music genres, pop music is purely based on what is attractive; The aesthetics. Black ideals are attractive but not black skin.

What you’ve said is “I like gangsta rap” as a contrast to pop music, othering black people before any context is given is at the very least is.. really fuckin strange and at worst, sparks red flags that as black person I would avoid talking to you just based on that."

Please. Give your thoughts on what makes up racism. I’m sure it’s very compelling. 

News flash: all white people, whether they’re actively trying to or not, contribute to racism. Someone saying you’re racist is at the least an objective observation and at the worst someone telling you to shut the fuck up when you’re speaking on stuff you don’t understand, have the resources to study, but just choose not to."

651,2020-08-20 13:59:40,idam7r,"Thank you for making it readable. Somewhat, remember on Reddit in order for a new line to appear you have to hit enter twice, not once."
652,2020-08-20 22:35:52,idam7r,"I'm trying out a pair of TH900's with the driver dampening mod, and I have to say that so far they're really, really, really, *really* nice."
653,2020-08-28 05:49:10,idam7r,"Hey just curious what pads are you using with both the Denon d7200 and th900? I have stock on d7200 and the dekoni sheepskin and dekoni hybrid for the th900. Imo my findings are completely opposite to yours. I'd consider the th900 a very very fun headphones but in pure technicalities, the Denon does a much better job without being too fatiguing. The caveat with the d7200 is that you have to use the stock pads, anything else will make it sound like a cheap ""less than 500 bucks"" headphones, and I've tried at least 5 different pads in them."
654,2020-08-21 03:00:23,idam7r,"It would be more appropriate if you are comparing your TH900 to the D9200, cos the D7200 is not at the same price range as the TH900 at all. I expect a clear advantage on the TH900 despite how much I love my D7200"
655,2020-08-21 10:33:37,idam7r,"I have the D9200 and the TH900 Mk2, and although I (slightly) prefer the sub-bass extension and rumble on the Fostex, the Denon flagship is the better headphone; it is more balanced from top to bottom, has slightly better resolution, has treble that isn't too piercing, and has a more nuanced but better-layered mid-bass presentation.

However, in terms of sheer ""fun"", the TH900 Mk2 takes the cake, especially with my genre-of-choice, EDM."
656,2020-08-31 13:22:40,idam7r,"Testing was with Stock pads on TH900 with eq vs Denon stock. Now I tested Eikon pads on TH900 with less Eq settings and I can say they are now better, little bit less soundstage, but mids are much better. I can say TH900 with Eikon pads are best headphones I try : Dt 1990, dt990, Shure 1540, Ndh 20, Audeze mobius, Hd650, one more triple, th600. TH900 have cleanest sound I heard, details and soundstage/ imaging are superb and FR for me with Eikon best so far."
657,2020-08-21 13:43:58,idam7r,"I would take the D7200 over the TH900 any day if its TH900 with stock pads. 

TH900 stock FR is a mess with very thin midrange and harsh treble. 
With TH610 pads, it becomes a super TH-X00 with better stage, resolution and bass. I don't think it's still worth $700 used, since the E-mu Teak comes very close to the TH900/610 pads for barely more than half the price.

I only heard the D7200 in the new line (still own them), but based on impressions and measurements, the D5200 and D9200 seems more ""neutral-bright"" than the warmish D7200."
658,2020-08-21 08:36:56,idam7r,"The street price 1400-1500 of the 900 is double the price of the 7200s (600-700), so yeah they’ll probably be better. Disclaimer, I have 7200s, and I love them. Now I want to hear the 900 despite all the v shape claims and now that I endorse eq."
659,2020-08-21 15:39:23,idam7r,I don’t agree with you ! After EQ TH900 are much better headphones
660,2020-08-21 15:57:16,idam7r,Someone probably doesn’t heart them side by side and only watch some review on TH900 without EQ 😂
661,2020-08-21 18:48:02,idam7r,"I've owned the TH900 (stock and with TH610 pads), the D2000/5000/7000/7200, TH-X00 and E-mu Teak.

The TH900 is the most resolving of the bunch but it has the worst tonality with stock pads and without EQ. Awful thin midrange with sucked-out lower-midrange, very aggressive 5-7 khz region which was more annoying than even the HD800 to my ears. Couldn't listen for more than 30 minutes at moderate volumes. So yes I prefer the D7200 to stock TH900 by a solid margin, and would even take a X00 over the premium model.

My impressions are here : https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/bi4suc/fostex_th900_my_comparison_with_other_foster_cans/

With EQ, it's another story of course."
662,2020-08-22 05:40:20,idam7r,I fixed FR with Sonarworks https://www.sonarworks.com/blog/reviews/fostex-th900-mk2-studio-headphone-review/#use-case but I use apo EQ. I found best sound with stock pads and EQ. When you recessed highs mids are more thicker.
663,2020-08-20 13:54:32,idahnm,"Didn’t Hayley recently decline a guest feature on a mainstream artist? I don’t think she would fancy a collaboration with Selena Gomez. With Taylor Swift, maybe. After all they are good friends."
664,2020-08-20 15:39:57,idahnm,I think Selena’s vibe is too dreamy to mesh well with Hayley’s intensity
665,2020-08-20 14:13:44,idahnm,"Hayley should collab with the Deftones again, I've always longed for a HQ version of that song"
666,2020-08-20 13:43:54,idahnm,"I don’t think Gomez is a strong enough vocalist for a really solid collab. I’d love to hear maybe Demi or Billie, Ariana or even Taylor."
667,2020-08-20 14:03:52,idahnm,"They’re only my two favorite people on Earth !!!
Even though Hayley can kick Selena’s ass any day"
668,2020-08-20 21:43:21,idahnm,"Selena would have a chance, but no one can match Hayleys vocal range, not even a wizard 😂"
669,2020-08-20 17:48:15,idahnm,What kind of a feat? Like a feat of strength?
670,2020-08-20 13:49:15,idahnm,Selena Gomez can’t sing.
671,2020-08-20 15:27:03,idahnm,i’d rather listen to nails on a chalkboard. i’d just end up editing out all of selena’s parts
672,2020-08-20 14:19:59,idahnm,Why not? Unless it takes time from some other collab she could have done I don't see the problem
673,2020-08-20 16:40:37,idahnm,I would support any content that Hayley delivers.
674,2020-08-20 16:41:02,idahnm,"Hayley and any member of boygenious (or all of them again)? Wouldn't mind a Pinegrove collab  or Now, Now one either."
675,2020-08-20 14:38:30,idahnm,"i just listened to both hayley's petals for armor and selena's rare this week. and petals for armor has easily climbed it's way into my fav albums this year, while rare is at the bottom of that list, so no"
676,2020-08-20 14:45:44,idahnm,I would love a Hayley + Grimes collaboration tbh
677,2020-08-20 17:24:00,idahnm,We need a haley williams and paramore collab
678,2020-08-20 14:09:23,idahnm,I'd much rather sharon van etten or julia jacklin
679,2020-08-20 14:02:00,idahnm,Hayley and my chem?
680,2020-08-20 14:54:37,idahnm,No. Selena is a huge fan of Hayley though.
681,2020-08-20 15:09:19,idahnm,hayley williams + julian casablancas
682,2020-08-20 14:01:53,idahnm,Yes with lil uzi vert. Said he was way too famous for her to collaborate with bc she didn’t want that much notoriety anymore.
683,2020-08-20 17:19:52,idahnm,Well said .
684,2020-08-20 21:30:18,idahnm,totally agree
685,2020-08-20 14:37:38,idahnm,Demi would be amazing since she loves Paramore herself.
686,2020-08-20 20:30:27,idahnm,"Yeah, I agree with this. Selena just isn't strong enough vocally to sing with Hayley. It would just sound odd."
687,2020-08-20 19:56:34,idahnm,I can’t see Billie doing a song with Hayley. She’s a weak vocalist.
688,2020-08-22 00:05:33,idahnm,Taylor is a strong vocalist?
689,2020-08-20 21:40:34,idahnm,love them both too!!! and man you’re so righttt. I love Selena so much but it’s Hayley you know?
690,2020-08-20 22:05:32,idahnm,good one 😂😂
691,2020-08-20 21:35:41,idahnm,could be
692,2020-08-20 14:39:58,idahnm,She can but nowhere near what Hayley can do. Now Hayley and Demi or Hayley and Jojo? Yess
693,2020-08-20 21:38:49,idahnm,Yes she can. But i agree that it is not THE perfect collab
694,2020-08-20 16:03:17,idahnm,Vaping can put bad things in your brain
695,2020-08-20 21:35:58,idahnm,me too!!!
696,2020-08-20 21:37:33,idahnm,I agree that their music don’t match... you know what I mean? but i was thinking about that these days and i thought “why not?”🤷🏻‍♀️
697,2020-08-20 21:33:20,idahnm,YESSSS
698,2020-08-20 17:30:39,idahnm,i love both but that would just be weird
699,2020-08-20 14:13:21,idahnm,god please no
700,2020-08-20 21:35:30,idahnm,"Yes, recently i saw an interview of the 18 y.o. selena talking about the bands she liked the most"
701,2020-08-20 14:07:11,idahnm,You've gotta be shittin me
702,2020-08-20 14:12:22,idahnm,"I went ""Who?"" then googled him and understood that as someone who couldn't care less about the rap scene, I am probably perfectly excused to not recognise someone ""that famous"" (honestly though, I am somewhat familiar with the old ""good"" rappers like Kanye or Kendrick, but with the hand on my heart I never heard of the Lil Uzi Vert guy until just now)."
703,2020-08-20 14:38:30,idahnm,Uzi sucks anyway. You can find better rappers to work with.
704,2020-08-20 16:32:03,idahnm,"Both Billie and Hayley have a lot of respect for each other, that'd be really cool."
705,2020-08-20 23:05:26,idahnm,Billie is a strong vocalist it’s just not the style she chooses to sing.
706,2020-08-22 00:13:07,idahnm,"I’ve seen her push out some pretty solid notes. More than Selena ever could. 
Is she on par with Hayley or Demi? No...but certainly they could sound good together."
707,2020-08-21 00:00:18,idahnm,"I’m gonna have to disagree that she can sing. She’s gotten some lessons over the years and has improved a bit, but generally I do not believe she’d have a recording contract if she weren’t on a tv show first. 

I would KILL for a Demi and/or Jojo collab though. They have the pipes and the soul in their voices for both artists to bring out the best in each other."
708,2020-08-20 23:58:40,idahnm,"I’m gonna have to disagree. She’s gotten some lessons over the years and has improved a bit, but generally I do not believe she’d have a recording contract if she weren’t on a tv show first."
709,2020-08-20 22:57:57,idahnm,glad this was downvoted cuz i’m like ???
710,2020-08-20 21:37:56,idahnm,Her favorite song is Fences
711,2020-08-20 16:36:41,idahnm,"Uzi on Hayley Williams - “She’s like the best,” he said. “It’s hard to top that. She’s like the best, just of my generation... There’s nobody bro.”"
712,2020-08-20 14:19:34,idahnm,"Ok good to know because you know, same lol"
713,2020-08-20 16:43:38,idahnm,"I just can't get into Billie. I've tried and it's just not my thing. I agree with the other comment, that Selena doesn't have the pipes to keep up. Demi and Hayley. Take my money."
714,2020-08-22 08:39:32,idahnm,"She's better than selena but that's not saying much. I think taylor would have the same problem selena would if she tried to collab with hayley, which is that hayley would completely overpower her."
715,2020-08-21 14:37:58,idahnm,Its a reference to the annoying Spotify ad lol. I guess its not been around for a long time
716,2020-08-22 12:19:06,idahnm,"Hayley is the superior vocalist for sure, BUT they wouldn’t have to write a song where it would be so obvious."
717,2020-08-22 19:24:05,idahnm,ah ok i see
718,2020-08-20 12:54:08,id9q10,Very hard choice but I pick Taylor Swift
719,2020-08-20 13:16:56,id9q10,Taylor
720,2020-08-20 13:19:12,id9q10,Selena Gomez
721,2020-08-20 12:46:57,id9idr,"Those gloves, damn."
722,2020-08-20 12:40:54,id9idr,That’s so hot
723,2020-08-20 13:17:55,id9idr,Obviously fake

725,2020-08-20 13:50:11,id9idr,why?
726,2020-08-20 13:51:40,id9idr,Because they say it’s fake
727,2020-08-20 14:06:27,id9idr,ty. that's too bad.
728,2020-08-20 23:15:47,id9idr,I know right

816,2020-09-07 05:21:40,io14i2,"Lol ur example of Selena Gomez- she’s 12 years older than I am but my parents are like 10 years older than hers. (‘66 and ‘67)

Her mom was just super young though. If I’m reading this correctly she would have been a teenager in hs, like 16.
So that’s more of an outlier. I assume most people that age have boomer or early gen x parents"
817,2020-09-07 18:28:24,io14i2,Damn Selena's mom had her at 16? Didn't even know that. Her mom is younger than my mom.
818,2020-09-07 10:08:21,io14i2,"It would be most common among last born babies in big families.

One of my relatives was born in 1978, which is considered around the time boomers started having kids. He has three siblings born in 1964-68, and a father born in the early 30s."
819,2020-09-07 15:25:15,io14i2,I’ve noticed that almost all my friends born in the late 80s/early 90s have gen Jones parents. Any earlier than that and it’s usually full on boomer. I’ve had a couple friends born my year with gen x parents born in the early 70s. I don’t really know anyone with silent gen parents though.
820,2020-09-07 17:07:19,io14i2,Most of my friends parents like mine were early boomers. No one had Xer parents
821,2020-09-07 18:45:23,io14i2,I think Selena is definitely an outlier. I don’t know many adults who are products of teen parents besides my mom and her sister. My parents had me on the older side but they weren’t super old. I still notice though that it’s getting rarer to find people in their early 20s with Gen Jones parents or older which makes me feel kinda old. People 2-3 years younger than me seem to rarely have parents born in the 60s.
822,2020-09-07 23:02:52,io14i2,My friend born in January 1994 has two younger Gen Z sisters born in 2001 and 2005 with a baby boomer dad born in 1956.
823,2020-09-07 05:22:39,io14i2,"Yeah Selena's is probably rarer compared to everyone, although the teen pregnancy rate skyrocketed in the late 80s to mid 90s or so, meaning loads of Xers were teen parents too.

My thinking is that late Silents/early to mid Boomers waited to have careers and move out to the suburbs before starting families on average, it's an interesting dynamic to have a dad who is like ""grandparents age"" to people just a few years younger."
824,2020-09-07 14:13:43,io14i2,My grandma was born in 46 and my parents  70 and 72. A lot of my friends have parents born in the mid to late 60s and early 70s.
825,2020-09-07 05:27:00,io14i2,"Yeah yours are way more typical I'd think. Even the average ""young parents"" are like 21 and might've met each other at their retail or entry level office job or something. I think teen pregnancy was highest in like 1991 or so,"
826,2020-09-07 18:39:00,io14i2,Same here lol
827,2020-09-07 17:45:48,io14i2,"Yeah he was the ""baby of the family"", having notably older siblings cushions it a bit, but he had a similar experience to me with a dad that could've passed for his grandpa."
828,2020-09-10 02:26:40,io14i2,"Plenty of Gen Jones seem young for their age, and I remember being a kid when they were only in their 30s in the 90s. It is unsettling and reminds me how cruel time is, that they're moving into grandparents age. Some early Xers born in like 1969 are young grandparents too."
829,2020-09-07 14:54:52,io14i2,[deleted]
830,2020-09-07 16:20:21,io14i2,"Ah the teen pregnancy rate in 1991 might explain it lol

People tend to have their first kid closer to their 30s these days

It depends on where you live and also how educated the parents are actually (higher the education, the later the child) 

I remember earlier in the summer, I was doing research on birth rates and rate of replacement, so I remember some of those stats.

I think late 20s-early 30s was the norm when I was born. When you factor in 2nd and 3rd children, having kids well into your 30s is pretty normal, but my parents still would have been a little old.

As for now, I believe, more women have kids in their 30s than 20s now, but I’m not 100% sure

When you were born, I’m guessing the average might have been mid-late 20s for first kid (which can seem early because you have to account for the whole country and every region and education level) so no surprise that your parents would have been an older generation than your peers parents. Even today that would be a bigger gap than usual. If you had really early boomer parents that would still be 40 years, so I think it’s safe to say that most people in your cohort had boomer parents (or X I guess)

I think most people my age have gen X parents, I have gen X parents who are RIGHT on the edge lol"
831,2020-09-10 03:01:58,io14i2,It’s freaky. I don’t think of the 60s as going on 60 years ago. When I was a kid 60 years ago seemed so old. The Great Depression and World War II seemed like a different universe.
832,2020-09-07 14:57:24,io14i2,"Thats makes it sound like the ""norm"".  When some says usually that typically means generally. But ok."

918,2020-10-10 12:42:25,j8ixj1,"A New Nightmare is one of my favorite Freddy movies so I was pretty intrigued by this post. And I admit that what you outlined could very well work and come out as a really fun time. 

But ultimately, it's just already been done with New Nightmare. If that hadn't been made, I'd say Scream is the perfect franchise to try this (also lots of good jokes about the real life Dewey and Gail romance/dynamic.) 

But... Nightmare on Elm St already went there and I just don't think it can be done twice."

921,2020-10-10 12:40:22,j8ixj1,"I watched Scream 4 like a week ago and had a similar theory for the 5th. I would love it if the new producers inside Scream 4 planned on making a reboot but without the meta commentary claiming it has been done to death since the original scream. Then they can list all the movies that since followed in Screams foot steps, humancentipede 2, 22 Jump Street, Jay and Silent Bob twice etc. I think there is a lot to work with there."
922,2020-10-10 15:48:10,j8ixj1,"I just watched A Cat in the Brain last night. It's Lucio Fulci writing and directing himself AS himself making a horror film. Highly recommend if you wanna see the ""Godfather of Gore"" in the godfather of meta horror films. It was also the last film he made before he died, so it's kind of bittersweet if you're a fan.

New Nightmare is great too. I love Heather Langenkamp!"
923,2020-10-10 17:17:48,j8ixj1,"Branching off from your Neve/Sidney scene. Have the film open with Sidney being stalked, not much different from the opening of the first movie with Drew. She's unfazed by the calls. She's done this shit 4 times over. But when the intensity revs up, over the phone Ghostface says something along the lines of ""it's time to die, Neve"". We started the movie thinking we were watching Sidney but it's Neve as Neve and we go in the real world direction. Does she die? Nope. She actually stops the killer. But then a co star is killed. Telling us and them there's another killer. Working together? Inspired? Who knows. I can't wait for more Scream though."

He somehow made an appearance in everything and everywhere, some pretty damn trivial news stories were tied to him in some way, and it was considered very special and worthy of column inches that he might want to live a semi-normal life and do normal things like visit a charity shop.

It got old fast."
