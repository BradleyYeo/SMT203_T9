1,2020-02-05 15:46:30,ezbent,Larry Sanders. $44M for 26 games of 7/6/1 basketball
2,2020-02-05 15:46:48,ezbent,Luol Deng and Timofey Mozgov
3,2020-02-05 15:46:43,ezbent,"Allan Houston. 

They created the amnesty clause because of that contract."
4,2020-02-05 15:46:30,ezbent,"2016. The off-season where Crabbe got paid by Portland (4 years 75m) and Parsons by Memphis (4 years 94m). Most contracts signed that year were really really bad.

As a Laker fan, I will never forget that year. We signed fckin Mozgov and Deng."
5,2020-02-05 15:45:54,ezbent,Josh smith no?
6,2020-02-05 15:47:08,ezbent,[deleted]
7,2020-02-05 16:13:26,ezbent,I’m just happy Hayward played his way out of these conversations
8,2020-02-05 15:56:06,ezbent,"Knicks signed Jerome James to a 5 year 30 mil deal (pretty big for 04/05). He played 7 MPG and averaged 2.5/2. He averaged more fouls than rebounds. Oh, and he only 'played' 90 games over 4 years."
9,2020-02-05 17:16:23,ezbent,"That 2016 cap boom gave us a lot of bad contracts. That one offseason had (worst first): 

Nicolas Batum 5/$120M  
Bismack Biyombo — 4/$72M  
Kent Bazemore — 4/$70M  
Ian Mahinmi — 4/$64M  
Timofey Mosgov — 4/$64M

The Batum one is awful because the numbers are so high, not because he didn't show promise. He had upside, just not that much. The other 4 guys all got contracts despite never even playing well in their (mostly bench) roles the year before that offseason. These deals never had any hope of returning value, the teams just had money to burn so they burnt it."
10,2020-02-05 15:53:54,ezbent,Allan Houston
11,2020-02-05 17:51:15,ezbent,Rashard Lewis was making like 20 mil a yr and not playing at all.
12,2020-02-05 15:48:28,ezbent,Mozgov and Deng.
13,2020-02-05 15:50:26,ezbent,Andrew Bynum. Philadelphia.
14,2020-02-05 16:15:39,ezbent,Omer Asik. Hands down.
15,2020-02-05 16:18:23,ezbent,Surprised no one has said Wiggins
16,2020-02-05 17:55:21,ezbent,Eddy curry for the Knicks is one i always think about.
17,2020-02-05 15:46:37,ezbent,Joe Smith
18,2020-02-05 15:46:50,ezbent,"Parsons is up there, I think Wall potentially could be the worst one but I don't think that can be decided until he plays basketball again.

Otto Porter is pretty bad, Batum is bad too."
19,2020-02-05 15:50:45,ezbent,"For the old heads like me, Hot Rod Williams had the GOAT awful contract back in the day."
20,2020-02-05 15:53:55,ezbent,Lakers are still paying off Luol’s contract too
21,2020-02-05 15:54:23,ezbent,Josh Smith.
22,2020-02-05 15:54:27,ezbent,"Nikola Pekovic

This one is different because of injuries, but he played 97 games of his 5-year $60 million contract. Also to note the salary cap when he signed was just under $60 million.

Year 1: 54 games played

Year 2: 31 games played

Year 3: 12 games played

Years 4-5: 0 games played"
23,2020-02-05 16:11:00,ezbent,"Rasheed Lewis, Tobias Harris, Joe Johnson’s at one time."
24,2020-02-05 16:44:09,ezbent,Evan Turner
25,2020-02-05 16:49:06,ezbent,Next year it will be Mookie Betts
26,2020-02-05 16:50:54,ezbent,John Konkac was once the highest played player in the NBA.
27,2020-02-05 20:54:25,ezbent,"Chandler Parsons only played a total of 101 games on a four year max deal, despite appearing on the court in all four years of his contract. I’m not sure anyone in the NBA has made so much to do so little or ever will"
28,2020-02-05 15:58:07,ezbent,John Wall.
29,2020-02-05 15:46:47,ezbent,Hiv/Life
30,2020-02-05 16:20:21,ezbent,Tobias Harris
31,2020-02-05 15:51:01,ezbent,made 43 million over two years and didn't play a game
32,2020-02-05 15:49:51,ezbent,He got bought out of it though so it's most likely not $44M
33,2020-02-05 15:49:16,ezbent,And we are still paying him right?
34,2020-02-05 15:49:42,ezbent,mozgov was so baffling. not sure there's been a quicker turnaround from near-max contract to out of the league
35,2020-02-05 15:48:16,ezbent,"I love the nugget that the Knicks didn’t actually use the amnesty clause on him, either. Just fun trivia."
36,2020-02-05 16:06:43,ezbent,And the Knicks didn't even use the Allan Houston rule on Allan Houston. They used it on Jerome Williams.
37,2020-02-05 15:58:53,ezbent,Tyler Johnson contract was terrible too
38,2020-02-05 16:06:12,ezbent,Batum contract signed that year also
39,2020-02-05 16:08:15,ezbent,Summer 16 when the cap exploded and GMs went crazy
40,2020-02-05 15:49:35,ezbent,Lol this one made me chuckle because a friend of mine saw him on an airplane while a Knicks game was on tv and he was still under contract.
41,2020-02-05 15:55:38,ezbent,Parsons got a 4-year 94m contract. He barely played
42,2020-02-05 17:30:37,ezbent,and Jaylen
43,2020-02-05 18:48:27,ezbent,They even named a rule after him that's how bad it was!
44,2020-02-05 18:23:31,ezbent,I still remember him re-injuring his knee that season from bowling.
45,2020-02-05 16:19:09,ezbent,Well he’s still available everyday. He’s just not that good lol. Some of these contracts are where players either rarely played or never played after receiving it.
46,2020-02-05 18:28:59,ezbent,"That's just the low-effort, circlejerk answer."
47,2020-02-05 15:51:18,ezbent,Na Parsons and wall got injured. Wall was an all nba player and Parsons had a lot of potential.
48,2020-02-05 16:18:09,ezbent,What could have been if he never got hurt
49,2020-02-05 15:58:10,ezbent,Years 4+5 weren't on our cap.
50,2020-02-05 17:33:14,ezbent,Joe balled out in the big3 & finessed the Pistons outta 220k. Still gettin checks
51,2020-02-05 15:52:21,ezbent,The dream
52,2020-02-05 16:09:30,ezbent,He played 17 games
53,2020-02-05 15:52:21,ezbent,Parsons would prob still beat this. He’s made close to 100 million in last 4 years and prob played less than 5 games.
54,2020-02-05 15:51:15,ezbent,ended up being like $22M
55,2020-02-05 15:49:40,ezbent,yes
56,2020-02-05 15:54:30,ezbent,Yeah and Lakers are still paying off Luol’s contract lol
57,2020-02-05 16:48:38,ezbent,Deng was pretty washed at that point too. Every Heat fan knew that was an egregious overpay the moment it was signed.
58,2020-02-05 16:04:25,ezbent,Wait so who did they use the amnesty clause on!?
59,2020-02-05 16:26:55,ezbent,You can thank Sean Marks for both of those
60,2020-02-05 15:57:52,ezbent,Parsons got 2 really good contracts and didn't live up to either.
61,2020-02-05 16:03:49,ezbent,"I mean I'm not indicting them as people or former players. Wall hasn't seen the floor since 12-26-18 and probably won't be back til the beginning of next season. So for 32 games last season, 0 this season, he's making 57 million. We also don't know how he will be as a player post injuries and he's making 41 mil next year, 44 mil in 2022 and 47 MILLION in 2023 when he's on the wrong side of 30 and when generally PGs begin to decline"
62,2020-02-05 16:33:18,ezbent,"True but it was exactly what OP asked about, large contracts when the players didn't even play. Also he was only good the first year of the contract the 2nd and 3rd year he was pretty bad and barely played."
63,2020-02-05 16:13:43,ezbent,I checked bbref and he didn't log a game in the '13 or '14 season. I could be wrong
64,2020-02-05 15:55:43,ezbent,He played 100 games
65,2020-02-05 16:16:21,ezbent,Arenas’s contract was before the cap blew up so it was definitely worse
66,2020-02-05 15:52:07,ezbent,Nice
67,2020-02-05 16:05:11,ezbent,Jerome Williams - Houston ended up retiring due to medical reasons later in the same season they used the clause. Pretty weird!
68,2020-02-05 18:02:07,ezbent,Marky marks was throwing out rogue offers left and right - didn’t he give a monster offer to Otto porter that Washington then matched? Or did I make that up
69,2020-02-05 16:15:03,ezbent,His contract didnt extend into 2014 it went into 2013 he  got paid 2012 and 2013 for 17 games 40 million he played 17 games in the 12 season
70,2020-02-05 16:11:35,ezbent,17 games of arenas seems better than 100 games of parsons
71,2020-02-05 16:07:45,ezbent,So knicks overpaying people isn’t anything new to current day. How has nothing changed...
72,2020-02-05 18:26:58,ezbent,"yes he did. everyone we gave a contract to has been traded since then lol 

get poison billed, bitches"
73,2020-02-05 17:59:41,ezbent,"From 2002-2016, the Knicks have paid the most luxury tax out of all teams: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxury_tax_(sports)#National_Basketball_Association_(NBA)

The Mavs spent the second most, and it's still $100m (yes, $100 million) less than the Knicks. I remember playing the old 2k games back then and the Knicks cap situation was always a fucking mess with a lot a deadwood on the roster."
74,2020-02-05 18:28:35,ezbent,As a kiwi I am proud that our only GM is a fuckin renegade
75,2020-02-05 18:30:27,ezbent,the man is absolutely beloved by our fan base.
76,2020-02-05 18:31:20,ezbent,Yeah i followed the nets the last couple of seasons because DLo was balling on my fantasy team - marks has done some solid work over there

91,2020-02-05 15:11:39,ezag3i,Exactly right! Our opponents would love for us to hurt ourselves by turning what was a legitimately good night for us on Monday into something bad. Fuck them. I thought having Pete be #2 in Iowa while Biden imploded would be ideal for us and I posted as much before the voting took place so this isn't just putting a positive spin on it.

Anyway, my ratings for all four (which you watched as well):

* *1917:* 8.5/10. Amazing experience. That is all.
* *Like a Boss:* 2/10. Shockingly offensive and unoriginal, and wastes an amazing cast. But it's the fun kind of bad movie that you can laugh at for how bad it is.
* *Bad Boys For Life:* 8/10. Genuinely enjoyed all of it, I was so happy when I found out this was good.
* *Dolittle:* 4/10. The script is awful but the cast makes the most out of it. A magical experience thanks to the CGI and cinematography, however, and again is pretty fun despite being bad."

Sorry, u/dolfan2354, but today you're going DOWN.

**RR** - I LOVED the Rivals II final. And OH MY GOD, Jenny. Landon and Turbo would be a fun matchup to watch. I think from there, u/wade5554 walks away easy. I'd take Jenny over both Jamie and Svetlana, and though we haven't seen Da'Vonne in a final, I'll assume she can keep up. Adam Kuhn was a very good competitor who was stuck with Brittany.

The Road Rules bracket is having a fucking slug fest in this final. I have no idea who to vote for. My vote is going to ""You Cannot Copy My Walk."" I think this really comes down to the body bags and they have the muscle to carry that extra weight. I really don't trust Knight, Jamie, or Svetlana at this part of the final. Wes looked half dead at this portion, Bananas was dead almost this whole final. I think Landon would be doing everything for this team at this stage, whereas there is some real muscle on the other squad. Turbo is small but strong and dedicated. Adam is a brick shithouse of unproven muscle. Jenny is She-Hulk. Day should do just fine carrying body bags with Adam."

**RW** - again voting for Adore Delano 2020. Ashley K and Ace aren't amazing but they have both run and done well in finals - especially recent ones. Amanda still hasn't been in one and the finals Veronica won weren't the same level as the Rivals 3 final. I think Ev could figure out the puzzles and Cohutta could help with eating.

**RR** - oooohhh this is a good match-up. we know Turbo can't swim, so can his team make up for the time they lose after the first part of the final? Da'Vonne has asthma, so will she be able to complete a final in the Thai heat? but more glaringly than either of them - Knight doesn't stick out to me as a good competitor... and his shoulder injuries would definitely flair up while carrying the bodybags. so this is TOUGH. and who can eat??

I'm gonna vote for /u/willtwerkf0rfood because I worry equally about Da'Vonne and Knight - and Landon is clearly a great team leader and motivator, so I think he can bring his team to a victory. Landon and Knight also seem like the type who will be able to eat gross sh!t, and I think Jamie would grit her teeth through it too."

127,2020-02-05 14:23:16,ez9pfp,"Betts at leadoff makes sense because that’s the spot he’s been most comfortable batting at throughout his career.  The Red Sox tried to move him down the order to increase his RBI count at the beginning of last season, and that backfired on them. 

Who they bat second is an interesting question. Muncy, Turner, and Seager took the most turns at that spot in 2019.  

Seager could have a really big year and demand those extra at bats.  In 2017, before his injury, that’s where Seager was always most comfortable in the order.

Turner took most of the two-hole at bats in 2018.

Or maybe they just decide that they need to maximize Bellinger’s at bats by moving him up the order. 

I think your guess is good.  I wouldn’t really quibble with it, except to suggest that Seager may be higher — at least the five spot."
128,2020-02-05 14:57:29,ez9pfp,Good God this lineup... I'd probably want Seager over Smith but that's probably my only real note. Everything else looks fine. More than fine of course.
129,2020-02-05 15:36:14,ez9pfp,Fuck it I want Belli batting second. It works for Mike Trout and Yellich. The more ABs the better. No lower than 3rd!

133,2020-02-05 15:45:50,ez9pfp,"I think if everything goes according to plan with Lux, and he is as billed, he'll be batting 2nd by the time October rolls around."
134,2020-02-05 15:40:08,ez9pfp,"That’s an interesting point. If we have Belli from the first half of last year who was hitting .400, that works. Mookie will get his insane number of runs scored and still match Joc’s leadoff HR count."
135,2020-02-05 16:06:23,ez9pfp,"Hitting second instead of fourth could give Cody around 30 more at-bats over the course of the season. Could be worth a win or two.

I’d go with:

Betts

Bellinger

Turner

Muncy

Seager 

Pollock

Lux

Smith

Maybe swap Pollock and Smith."

165,2020-02-05 08:38:46,ez5woc,I wouldn't make a whole party with class levels. Instead look at the stat blocks of guild NPCs and maybe replace an ability or spell to better fit the flavor you want. There's reasons why monsters only have a few spells and abilities compared to the complexity of PCs - running a whole party by yourself is super hard and will slow down your turns a lot because you will have to many choices for each character you run. The DMs turns should be relatively short to let the players shine on theirs.
166,2020-02-05 21:02:48,ez5woc,"Thank you for the input, I'm considering doing exactly this now. So, for example, taking a bard stat block from bestiary and throwing on him Whispers college signature ability with psychic damage would work just fine I guess?"
167,2020-02-05 11:48:28,ez5woc,"This. I do something similar frequently. The best thing is to add flavorful spells and maybe add one signature class ability or feat to make them unique. Though those abilities don’t need to be the exact same as the player ability. Use existing monsters for inspiration 

For instance, I made a NPC paladin with divine smite as a cool down action similar to the air elemental myrmidon’s lightning strike action. 


Volo’s guide has some examples of NPC bards, wizard and warlocks."
168,2020-02-06 05:11:43,ez5woc,"Monsters are also balanced differently than PCs, with much more HP and lower AC/DCs. Statting enemies like PCs tends to lead to very swingy battles with lots of missing and one-shotting."
169,2020-02-05 21:57:59,ez5woc,"Probably. If you have GGtR, you could also look at the stat blocks for the various guild agents it provides. I haven't looked at them in detail but they could be useful as a base for your modified versions."

Agreed.

>The Boys.

Yes.

>Umbrella Academy

No, just no. I can't say it was as badly written as *Hancock*, but it's still horribly written. The conflict was so artificial, you could say ""in this episode, the group fails to communicate normally"" and you'd successfully predict the cause of the conflict every single time no matter how contrived the reason would be. It's overloaded with moments of ""X character acts this way not because it makes sense but because otherwise we'd have no conflict"". The whole thing feels like it was the first time the writer had even tried writing anything, and they didn't bother with a second draft."
212,2020-02-05 21:59:42,ez5eqg,Are those on Netflix? Can't check at the moment

215,2020-02-05 16:27:13,ez5eqg,You have to think about the year the movie came out. Then the answer is obvious. Definitely spirals downward after the middle or so though.

218,2020-02-05 16:25:29,ez5eqg,*The Boys* never would have been made when *Hancock* came out. No studio would’ve touched it (R for sure) and HBO was basically the only entity that would’ve even considered it.

220,2020-02-05 16:39:39,ez5eqg,The original comic of *The Boys* was first published 2 years before *Hancock* was released. And *Watchmen* (which every superhero story like this is loosely based on) came out in the 80s.
221,2020-02-05 16:41:58,ez5eqg,I agree that a lot of problems were literally poor communication but I feel like the characters and the actors carry the show.
222,2020-02-05 16:46:58,ez5eqg,I mean they are all bad at communicating though they had a fucked up childhood...the only time it felt artificial was near the end where everyone listens to monkey boy and keeps her locked up for no reason
223,2020-02-05 17:26:29,ez5eqg,"eh, I thought Umbrella Academy, while has a lot of shortcomings was still entertaining. The production and characters were great. There was definitely eye-rolley moments and some poor scripting, but to OP's point it is done MUCH better than Hancock. Writing aside, it's an entertaining show."

EDIT: He just got to prison and he straight up done did it."
225,2020-02-05 17:51:37,ez5eqg,Movie vs comic. I’m talking specifically about the movies/shows. I can’t see *The Boys* as we have it now coming out in 2008. Can you?
226,2020-02-05 17:27:15,ez5eqg,I also think their poor communication was quite realistic to a dysfunctional family.

However if he’s playing in English football you can see his stats in the PL, EFL cup, and FA cup and he could potentially have bad form which would stunt his growth. Its probably more beneficial to loan him outside England. His growth should be the same whether he goes to PSG, Juve, etc. as it would be if he goes to Brescia, Dijon, etc. the quality of the team your loaning him to is irrelevant"
232,2020-02-05 06:56:00,ez5akd,Hmm. That helps a lot if youre sure about it. Seems odd but would make things a lot easier.
233,2020-02-05 07:06:51,ez5akd,"Yeah they always have “okay” form and you can’t see their moral effectors so they just grow at their pre determined rate based on their potential. Typically you won’t see any attribute changes throughout the season until like late December then you should see a big change as their attributes all change at once. This might happen again in April or May but not always. Just be careful when you get them back from the loan, due to the loan glitch their potential could change and their value can go up or down so you could be losing out if he comes back with lower potential than when you loaned him. Save before he comes back and then reload if he comes back worse and retry"
234,2020-02-05 07:13:41,ez5akd,How would you know if his potential has declined?
235,2020-02-05 07:14:03,ez5akd,by comparing the value you mean?
236,2020-02-05 07:18:52,ez5akd,Yeah or by his potential status. If he’s an exciting prospect when you loan him out and he comes back as showing great potential for example. That means his potential has dropped. Right before he’s due to come back from loan go into the squad hub and tab over to financial and check his transfer value. Then when he comes back make sure it’s the same value or a higher value (meaning you gained from the loan glitch) otherwise if it’s lower you’re losing out
237,2020-02-05 07:20:29,ez5akd,"Great tips. Thank you very much. Have some Karma, big guy"
238,2020-02-05 05:54:10,ez4nft,"After all the shenanigans going on the off season, two World Series losses in a row, losing to the Nats, I was beginning to feel unexcited for this upcoming season. I have since been reinvigorated! Can't wait! Go Blue!!!!!

Edit: and of course being ousted by Nats last year"
239,2020-02-05 07:13:48,ez4nft,I was really bummed out going into the season especially after none of the Astros players getting punished. It was like a slap in the face tbh. With Kobe passing away I was just in a really shitty mood but this trade for Betts has me really excited again and I’m ready for another run at a possible World Series. It would be so sweet for the Lakeshow to win this year and the dodgers to finally bring the championship back to LA.
240,2020-02-05 07:19:27,ez4nft,"I know! Man, Kobe's passing really had me in a funk.. man, if Lakers and Dodger's pull it off this year that would be incredible!"
241,2020-02-06 00:46:44,ez4nft,I have a feeling both the Dodgers and Lakers are going to be driven like never before. Both teams want to bring a championship to this city. It'll be a dream if we get 2 parades this year.
242,2020-02-05 05:57:56,ez4lkl,Smith has a full offseason and spring to learn his pitching staff. Dude was a mid season rookie with a full pitching staff to learn.... hitting came second. I think this year he’s going relax and hit more this year for sure maybe even put up Posey numbers
243,2020-02-05 05:44:59,ez4lkl,"It just depends on how he does. If Ruiz does well in AAA and Smith struggles in the beginning of the season, then smith goes down and Ruiz becomes the catcher. As Ruiz is projected to be better than smith anyway, I wouldn’t breathe a sigh of relief just yet we have to see what happens. Most likely scenario is Ruiz getting Traded though."

292,2020-02-05 15:32:44,ez3met,Pollock = NL comeback player of the year
293,2020-02-05 04:35:29,ez3met,Is this even still a thing people are thinking or are you just dreaming?
294,2020-02-05 06:08:35,ez3met,"After typing it out, I realized two things:

Muncy and Turner have been better offensively than Betts for the last 3 years!

We have no pitching depth for the playofffs."
295,2020-02-05 05:38:28,ez3met,"Pollock is better than Puig lol. He put up nearly the same amount of fWAR in half as many at bats last year. Pollock is absolutely an improvement. By fWAR/AB it's not even close.

The main difference is pollock is a platoon piece, but given the Dodgers deep bench thats hardly an issue. Hes being overpaid but hes definitely a better player than Puig on the field, and likely in the clubhouse."
296,2020-02-05 05:18:38,ez3met,Pollock better than puig. And I loved the stallion. Just inconsistent.
297,2020-02-05 15:43:09,ez3met,"And then the playoffs start...dun...dun...dun.

I want the Dodgers to win, so hopefully Pollock improves during the regular and postseason now. I mean, he's making $15,000,000, $18,000,000, $13,000,000 and $10,000,000 dollars over the next four years, and he's already 32-years-old right now.

Damn, without that insane contract, the Dodgers could have kept the homegrown player who was too good last year to be in consideration for Comeback Player of the Year. He did almost win the 2017 World Series MVP though.

If the Dodgers didn't hand out that contract, the Dodger could have signed Joc and just in 2020 saved $6,5000,000. That's more than Kiké and CT3 make."
298,2020-02-05 04:40:17,ez3met,Well we still got prospects.
299,2020-02-05 05:24:18,ez3met,">Just inconsistent 

When was the last time AJ Pollock had a consistently good season?   Lol"
300,2020-02-05 15:48:44,ez3met,"I concur the playoffs were outright disgusting - w/ that said, last year he was very solid his +/- 80 games & he was coming off elbow issues. He is healthy, which allows him to qualify for comeback player, in great shape & will start the season w/ the team. If they give him the opportunity he deserves he will come through. Or at least that’s what my inner “Vin” is telling me."
301,2020-02-05 05:47:07,ez3met,Compared to puig? Lol
302,2020-02-05 15:33:24,ez3met,Last season minus the playoffs
303,2020-02-05 15:58:20,ez3met,"In his shortened season, he was pretty solid offensively, but he was a determent defensively. 

There was a reason why the ""everyday centerfielder"" was quietly moved to left-field before the playoffs."
304,2020-02-05 06:07:13,ez3met,"They're both living off the success of one good season.  But Pollock is currently worst than Puig, older than Puig, and gets paid more than Puig to boot."
305,2020-02-05 16:13:11,ez3met,"Or Bc Bellinger got pulled from first after almost injuring his shoulder & he was the younger, faster defender. The elbow is healed which will allow him to get back into defensive shape"
306,2020-02-05 16:22:38,ez3met,"Do you believe Friedman or not, because before you said that you did? Well, he said multiple times that Pollock was going to be the everyday centerfielder for years, even if Bellinger played in the outfield.

So, for some time after Bellinger got ""hurt"", he still played right field, and Pollock stayed in center. Bellinger was moved to centerfield when they realized that Pollock had regressed defensively. Joe and Orel even mentioned the move briefly, because Friedman has gone out of his way to unsuccessfully (so far) explain why Pollock is the biggest FA contract that he (Friedman) has ever given out.

Hopefully, this will be the year that Pollock stays healthy, turns his game around and earns that $15 million. I'd still rather have Joc for $8.5 million, but no-one asked me."

3 Fabricating a story about why he’s able to stitch a wound.  

An interesting thing about Kvothe's lies is he isn't that great at it.  
> “If anyone asks, tell them my grandfather was a caravan guard who taught me how to clean and stitch a wound.  

This is an interesting lie to tell. I'm assuming 'caravan guard' justifies how he knows to clean and stitch a wound. Makes sense, if you are a guard you should have some rudimentary medical skills. 
But contrast this lie with the other one he tells.  

> Kote spoke crisply and cleanly. “I was a city-licensed escort from Ralien. Wounded while successfully defending a caravan. Arrow in right knee. Three years ago. Summer. A grateful Cealdish merchant gave me money to start an inn. His name is Deolan. We were traveling from Purvis. Mention it casually. Do you have it?”  

The usual cast of characters aren't mentioned in this part of the frame. It's when the travelers come in. In this lie Kvothe IS the caravan guard. If Cob and Co. heard this it might raise a question or two. And there's the lie within the lie. *Cealdish men don't give away money.*  


> We’ll call X whatever Kvothe is waiting for, be X a person, an event or a moment.  

And it's not just Kvothe. Bast seems like he knows something is coming...  

> After a moment Bast began to fidget. “Any news?” Kote shook his head. “They didn't get to the news tonight. Carter disrupted things while they were still telling stories. 

&nbsp;  

> Why are the scrael there? Do they communicate, receive orders, or something else? Vagueness overload.  

If you want to buy into what Pat was selling with True Dungeon, the scrael are constructs and they have a queen.

446,2020-02-05 12:23:10,eyxvn2,">Kote uses *three* languages when joking with Bast: since it’s not mentioned what they are, I’d assume the earliest is Tema 

It's temic, actually:

> ""Begone demon!"" Kote said, switching to a thickly accented Temic through half a mouthful of stew. ""Tehus antausa eha!"" \[NOTW, ch. 1\]

&#x200B;

Also, another lie of Kote (or at least omission): \[about the Tinker rhyme\]

> ""Just something I heard once,"" Kote said to fill the silence, obviously embarrassed. \[NOTW, ch. 1\]

&#x200B;

> The only mountains west are the Stormwal, which leads me to fear for Ademre. 

A nation of fighters with ancient metal swords would probably not even fare badly against the scrael.

&#x200B;

> His tentatives to make Bast run away are very weak, but it’s likely the faeling prince would never run away in any case.  
>  
>What is their kind of bond, exactly?

Also, what is Kote supposed to be teaching Bast (given that the pupil rather *faeries* around than reads his book)?

> Bast's expression was shocked. ""I couldn't leave, Reshi."" He opened and closed his mouth a few times, at a loss for words. ""Who else would teach  me?"" \[NOTW, ch. 1\]

&#x200B;

> I’m so grateful to these two champs that I’ve made a reward for you all. [Here’s the Frame explained with a single diagram.](https://imgur.com/a/4TKNE1G) 

Besides the fact that I really appreciate your subtle humour, the diagram is telling stuff. For example that money is really not a problem for Kote (as we'll see in later chapters). I wonder if that's because Kote has a lot of money (possibly through some sort of patron/Stapes), or because he doesn't expect to live for much longer (thus eliminating any worldly problems). The latter would be contradicted by the constant cleaning. But I just don't like cleaning."

448,2020-02-20 04:58:19,eyxvn2,"> It seems reasonable to say that Carter and Chronicler are coming from the same direction. 

I don't think so. Carter encountered the scrael  ""*two miles outside town, past the Oldstone Bridge.*""

Later ""*your childhood friend didn't stomp one to death on the road to Baedn-Bryt*.""

So the road leads from Newarre past Oldstone Bridge heading towards Baedyn-Bryt. In TLT we're told Baden/ Baedn is more than 40 miles from Newarre.

Chronicler is on the road heading to Newarre. Before reaching Newarre, he passes through Abbott's Ford and Rannish. He says he has an appointment with the Earl of Baedn-Bryt in Treya.  If Treya is a town in the earldom of Baedn-Bryt, that puts Chronicler coming from one end of Newarre and Carter coming home from the other end.

> Tehus antausa eha 

In chapter 22 we see this line repeated verbatim during the midwinter pageantry by a woman to rid herself of the harrassing demon. And we're told that it invokes the name of Tehlu.

""*At sound of Tehlu's name..""*  

So it means ""begone demon in the name of tehlu"" or some variation of that.

 

 

**Crazy Martin**

He planted barley instead of beans, the mad man. But what if barley is needed? Not so crazy anymor, huh? Iirc someone wrote that you can make beer with that, something soldiers would like for sure.

In The Lightning Thief we learn why Martin plants barley. He runs a still. Can't make hillwine ( although Bast says it's much much better than hillwine) with beans right?

Anyway, thanks for undertaking this!"

450,2020-02-05 19:36:41,eyxvn2,"I have been thinking a lot about the purpose of the architectural design of K's fireplace in his room. As I was reading this and thinking about the maps in general, I was trying to place other prominent fireplaces in the story. I am making the assumption that the Inn is designed in a very specific way for purpose to solve for X. I know they use fireplaces a lot to have a source to something which might be the reason to have a fireplace in his room. I think more telling is the design of the Fishery and particular Kilvin's heat eater (?) which he can use to move the crazy amount of energy when bad things happen in the Fishery. What if the design is a gigantic heat eater that K needs for when X comes to the Inn.

Another thought. When describing his room, as compared to Bast's, it is very basic and boring. Really, the only two things of note are the chest and the fireplace. What if opening the chest requires an insane amount of energy and the fireplace is a heat eater (to suck up bad stuff that comes out when it opens) or is a gigantic poor-boy to use as a energy source for X or opening the chest. 

tldr: I think the fireplace is important and think it may serve a purpose like the Fishery"

452,2020-04-03 22:30:38,eyxvn2,"I'm not sure if this little tidbit was incorporated on any of the maps of the Waystone. The taproom fireplace faces north. So assuming the fireplace is not on the wall with  the bar or the wall with the front door, this means that  the Waystone is oriented facing either East or West. This also means that  the road through Newarre runs North-South. 

I think the Inn faces East. When Folly is hung on the wall there was autumn light coming  through the wide windows. This was the morning light. So my guess it's east rather than west. 

Also this explains the presence of scrael at both ends of the road  - heading into Newarre from Abbott's Ford and heading out of Newarre towards Baedn Bryt.  The Scrael approached Newarre from the East.  

So this would put the taproom fireplace to the right as you enter the Inn through the front doors. Now the windows at the front is described as wide and I'm guessing the windows and doors take up most of the front wall. So the staircase going up would most logically be on the south wall to the left of the front doors as you enter."

There is/was a company called True Dungeon that does real-life D&D style adventures for conventions. Complete with props and costumed actors. Pat teamed up with them and did a couple of modules.

Don't remember the wealth levels so mine is just speculation, but I think in comparison to the average Jake the mayor is... well, he's very rich. 

Wish I could remember well the eventual differences between Krin and Ellie, after all their wealth levels mirror average farmer/mayor iirc.

478,2020-02-06 15:38:38,eyxvn2,"I respectfully disagree, only parts of stories are lies.   Please humor me a bit as I realize this sounds slightly OSS, but I am going to use a different L word lol.

**""All stories are true,”** Skarpi said. “But this one really happened, if that’s what you mean.” He took another slow drink, then smiled again, his bright eyes dancing. **""More or less. You have to be a bit of a liar to tell a story the right way. Too much truth confuses the facts. Too much honesty makes you sound insincere.”**

I personally take this to mean within all the stories inside of KKC (even the frame) there are truths, even if disguised as a lie.  I mean the character of Kote symbolizes this to me--it is Kvothe disguised as a lie.  

Within the lies there is truth as in your example of the Cealdish lie hidden within other lies because in fact the truth is the complete opposite.  The lie reveals the truth *if* you understand the bigger picture.  Maybe that sounds insane, but it is another paradox in KKC.  

For example, ""impossible truths"" how does that work?  Is an impossible truth a lie?  

**""Pieces of story and memory slowly fit together. *I began to admit impossible truths to myself.* The Chandrian were real. Haliax was real. If the story Skarpi had told was true, then Lanre and Haliax were the same person.""** 

Chronicler narrates this paradox in the very beginning of NToTW when speaking to Kvothe:

**""But you of all people should realize how thin the line is between the truth and a compelling lie. Between history and an entertaining story.”**

Now, as your comment about lies within lies points out, finding the lie within a series of lies inside *any* story of KKC might be our way of pinpointing the truth.  Our literal code or cypher.  I guess that is why we are all here on the sub, deciphering what is a lie and what is true.  :)"

Also,

>The Steelers have been having some struggles at the nose tackle position and while it may not need to be replaced, it could certainly use some help

It's not an issue of NT being weak but rather losing our starter at said position. Javon Hargrave is very talented but we likely won't be able to afford him on the open market, and Tuitt returning would cut into his snap count regardless. You got the need right but the reasoning is off."

519,2020-02-04 23:07:52,eyx205,Moseley is gonna be an ERFA so he will 100% be back with the Niners next season.
520,2020-02-04 23:12:26,eyx205,"In the end, I feel like most surprise picks occur due to a team having someone ranked highly on their big board but in a lower tier for position of need. To them, the cost benefit analysis of taking a more talented player at an area that isn't seen as a huge need works out. 

Usually, teams are fairly consistent with their needs and draft choices. But there's always a few (Lions last year) that just draft by best available player."
521,2020-02-05 00:07:38,eyx205,Honestly I would love the Vikings taking Winfield. Maybe it’s bias as a gopher fan but I think he is criminally underrated.
522,2020-02-05 01:49:57,eyx205,I would love it if Miami got Isaiah Simmons and K'Lavon Chaisson. Let them each take one side of the field at a number of positions.
523,2020-02-05 02:22:51,eyx205,For the Lions I think the surprise pick would be any OT
524,2020-02-05 07:04:49,eyx205,"For the Bills

1) Spain plays LG and Ford took snaps at RG in pre-season and training camp. So if Ford does move to guard he'd be replacing our RG. 

2) Sincerely doubt the Bills let Spain walk. We have so much cap space we are forced to spend to get above the cap minimum. Spain was our best lineman last year on a line that had more downs than ups. I don't see a scenario where we let him walk, especially with a young QB. 

3) That doesn't mean we don't take a tackle there. In fact, most Bills fans believe Ford would be a feast at guard and tackle as one of our primary needs  

So, I agree, just for different reasons"
525,2020-02-05 09:01:22,eyx205,"I like this format of a mock draft. 



As a Panthers fan I was thinking the same thing several times as I look at draft prospects. We really need to beef up defense but then I picture a healthy Cam with a surplus of weapons and think, defense just needs to be okay if we going to score 35+ every game and we can get to okay with FA. Bring on Juedy! 



That said I think Panthers end up with Simmons if he isn't taken before our pick."
526,2020-02-05 15:40:17,eyx205,"I feel like Fromm deserves a place on this list somewhere.  
Draft grades on him could range from 1st to 5th."
527,2020-02-05 00:24:26,eyx205,I think a trade of Trent Williams and a trade down is more likely than people may think. Their DL is already really good but their OL leaves a lot to be desired. Protecting their young QB and getting more picks in the process may be their move.
528,2020-02-05 01:39:25,eyx205,Really only the 1st two are surprises.
529,2020-02-05 02:35:05,eyx205,"So did Derrick Brown die just before you’re draft? It’s fun to see this, good work"
530,2020-02-05 03:11:21,eyx205,"Looks like someone is bored 
Did you draw these from a hat?"
531,2020-02-05 04:49:22,eyx205,"Isaiah Simmons to the Lions would be a massive, massive surprise. Bob Quinn has hand-picked every Linebacker on the roster. He likes them no matter how much you think they suck.

I, personally, would be surprised by him going in the top 8 to anyone, but especially the Lions it's just incredibly unlikely."
532,2020-02-05 06:05:38,eyx205,"Honestly... I wouldn't really be upset at all with Epenesa and Hall. Obviously we probably shouldn't take another edge rusher in the 1st, but hey, Sacksonville worked before."
533,2020-02-05 16:24:05,eyx205,A true surprise at #4 for the Giants would be them pulling a move like the Raiders did with Ferrell and taking Epenesa earlier than everyone thinks. Pass rush is a priority this off-season and with how bare the cupboard is and shallow the class plus there is only so much you can do in free agency I can see it happening in a .01% kind of way.
534,2020-02-05 17:40:38,eyx205,"The only way WAS doesn't select Chase Young is if they take a quarterback. I actually think that scenario is more likely than discussed--totally new regime inheriting a quarterback they had no hand in selecting, and who didn't play terribly well as a rookie."
535,2020-02-05 17:45:12,eyx205,"I think a good candidate for a Baltimore surprise pick is a safety or cornerback. EDGE is actually a need, whereas the secondary is stacked (even with likely Jimmy Smith and Brandon Carr departures). And yet, I can see Baltimore taking a S or CB because they spend so much time in nickel and dime, CBs especially are fragile, and Baltimore values secondary above front 7. Would have to be someone very high on their big board still available, though."
536,2020-02-06 06:02:24,eyx205,if the Bengals take Hebert they will also be the first time ever to sell ZERO season tickets. it'd be like Chargers games except 100% visiting fans
537,2020-02-06 22:53:19,eyx205,"If they stay at 1 AND pick Herbert the NFL should force Mike brown to sell the team to someone competent. Maybe we can set up hidden audio and convince him to pull a Sterling.

Edit: reread part about this not taking into effect draft order. Still if they don't pick Burrow people in Cincinnati will riot. I may drive back to join them too."
538,2020-02-10 02:14:46,eyx205,Evan Weaver. #1 Linebacker in the draft.
539,2020-02-13 10:46:01,eyx205,This whole draft is a reach and 90% of positions are overvalued and overtaken.
540,2020-02-05 01:18:56,eyx205,"I love Simmons, but if Young is available, we’re taking him no question. Granted I would not be surprised if Simmons ends up the best defensive prospect of this draft. But at this moment you have to go with Young."
541,2020-02-05 00:57:43,eyx205,"I don't think Tyler Johnson at 52 should be a surprise. He's a first round talent, but this is a deep receiver class, so he will probably fall out of the first round. If he's still available at that point, he's a tremendous value."
542,2020-02-04 21:16:08,eyx205,Ah rip forgot to update that when the news broke
543,2020-02-05 02:19:28,eyx205,Not looking good for X in Miami either :(
544,2020-02-04 22:27:20,eyx205,Preciate it!
545,2020-02-04 21:17:09,eyx205,Gotcha gotcha my apologies
546,2020-02-04 22:09:34,eyx205,"Agree completely. We rarely have all 3 DL on the field at once.

Tuitt and Cam can absolutely line up in the nickel.

However, I would enjoy a dominant NT"
547,2020-02-05 14:47:11,eyx205,"Dang. I’m really hoping for the Bears to try and snag Spain. 

^....Sorry...."
548,2020-02-04 22:27:04,eyx205,"Will keep that in mind going forward, do you expect Bills to invest any early picks in the line then? No I’d assume right? Maybe just some depth later on?"
549,2020-02-05 01:49:48,eyx205,"So wouldn't the correct pick here be edge or OL that's projected to go mid-late 1st, because that's the surprising pick for the Seahawks?"
550,2020-02-05 01:49:38,eyx205,"So wouldn't the correct pick here be edge or OL that's projected to go mid-late 1st, because that's the surprising pick for the Seahawks?"
551,2020-02-05 08:28:42,eyx205,"Ill give them a pass on Ifedi because they desperately needed a tackle and he was legit the best available when they were picking. He was maybe a fringe first rounder and they took him in the early twenties I think so just a minor reach, but wasn’t seen as a bad pick at the time.

The rest were pretty much planned across the board and Seattle’s bad drafting could really start haunting them soon."
552,2020-02-04 22:10:26,eyx205,Yeah I feel like this early with this much variance I was almost just predicting 2nd/3rd round picks in order to keep the value of “surprise” pick
553,2020-02-05 03:38:04,eyx205,"Either we go for one of the 3 Bama WR / CeeDee Lamb / Higgins or we trade the fuck out to next year or trade our first for an established receiver. 

Enough is enough. Brady coming back will not be helped by us going defense in the first."
554,2020-02-04 22:54:59,eyx205,Thank you!
555,2020-02-05 01:30:48,eyx205,"Honestly was going to say for Detroit a surprise is Jerry Juedy or an OT like Andrew Thomas, both potential needs so not like super crazy if you really dive into the Lions"
556,2020-02-04 22:26:13,eyx205,"Savage wasn’t a surprise in terms of need, but most mock drafts prior had him slotted in the 2nd round at earliest. That’s why I have Madubuike as a surprise too just more based on prospect stock instead of positional need.

Thanks for the support and read!"
557,2020-02-04 22:55:28,eyx205,Perfect for Fangio I feel like. Could easily see him being the pick assuming he kills the combine like I expect
558,2020-02-05 00:19:07,eyx205,In scenario who is week 1 qb?
559,2020-02-04 21:36:31,eyx205,I actually wouldn’t be surprised if no RBs get drafted in first round
560,2020-02-04 23:49:22,eyx205,What about no chase young?
561,2020-02-04 23:37:03,eyx205,Yeah agreed
562,2020-02-05 01:21:13,eyx205,Agreed
563,2020-02-05 02:38:23,eyx205,Would be fun especially with a mastermind like Flores
564,2020-02-05 03:12:14,eyx205,I honestly didn’t feel like the tackles were surprise picks cause it sounds like they may be leaning that way. Not sure though.
565,2020-02-05 15:14:49,eyx205,I think what would likely happen *if* we drafted Niang is Ford would move to RG and Feliciano would either become our top interior OL backup or would get traded (sad though that would make me). Then Niang would ease into the starting RT role similar to how they handled Ford/Nsekhe this year.
566,2020-02-05 01:30:35,eyx205,[deleted]
567,2020-02-05 02:36:36,eyx205,Lmao I just don’t think any of the top 5 will take him and don’t see him as much of a surprise pick past that. Thanks for the kind comments
568,2020-02-06 17:36:54,eyx205,Looks like Derrick Brown and Chase Young killed somebody in this draft universe.
569,2020-02-05 03:11:34,eyx205,No
570,2020-02-05 01:19:55,eyx205,Young likely won’t be available for the Lions and that wouldn’t be a surprise pick at all but yes if he’s there the Lions would take him probably I agree
571,2020-02-11 16:35:45,eyx205,He’s good now
572,2020-02-04 22:37:53,eyx205,"Yeah I like this type of format. Since we do it every year saying ""No way the XYZ's pick a player at XYZ position"", so it is good to see someone there who doesn't fill a need b/c it is very possible that can be the pick."
573,2020-02-04 22:08:54,eyx205,Never apologize for this level of effort
574,2020-02-04 22:11:13,eyx205,"Yep, it felt like we played a base 4-2-5 more than anything and the two interior linemen would be Cam and Tuitt if both are healthy. You certainly need talented bodies for rotational purposes but the value on that isn't high enough to draft early."
575,2020-02-05 14:48:17,eyx205,Thuney? He's a similar age and slightly better but probably quite a bit more expensive
576,2020-02-05 01:12:11,eyx205,No only depth picks. Maybe if some really good falls
577,2020-02-05 07:06:00,eyx205,"I posted it just now, but Spain is a LG. Ford took snaps before the season at RG, so whether we keep Spain or not has no impact on Ford or drafting a RT. 

OL is a primary need and despite what the other Bills fan said, our GM has outlined a very clear strategy. Address needs through free agency and draft the best player available. Last year we went out and got two WRs, several offensive lineman, and a CB. That left us with our only primary need being an interior defensive lineman, which is why we drafted Ed Oliver. 

So, we will get a much clearer picture after free agency, but I can see us addressing RT in free agency with a guy like Bryan Bulaga who might cost us half of what Conklin would. I can see us signing a guy like Josh Norman once he gets cut by Washington as he is a former McDermott guy. Seems like we are in on TE Olsen. At WR I can see us giving Devin Funchess a one-year prove it deal. 

So, I see WR, edge, and linebacker (if we don't resign Milano) in play. Best available of our primary needs."
578,2020-02-05 03:48:53,eyx205,"I think Spain could go either way and OL makes a lot of sense. Big improvements last year from awful to average but RT was still a struggle and you’re right on about Ford likely being better at guard. 

Depending on how FA breaks and if there’s an early run on WR in the draft or they like someone later then RT could work; same goes for edge."
579,2020-02-05 07:47:41,eyx205,"Surprise pick will be a RT prospect, we are set for the interior"
580,2020-02-07 20:08:13,eyx205,"Great point.  A surprising pick would be a good, non-reach pick at a position of need.  I would be shocked.  LOL"
581,2020-02-04 22:34:35,eyx205,Tbf he was mostly a late riser because he ran a 4.3 at the combine
582,2020-02-05 01:44:11,eyx205,"Chase Young, obviously"
583,2020-02-04 21:38:34,eyx205,"I will be.  I don't necessarily believes RBs *should* go in the first, but with this year's class, and the fact that Miami has 3 first round picks, I'd be pretty surprised."
584,2020-02-05 01:18:14,eyx205,And no burrow at all
585,2020-02-05 15:50:24,eyx205,"I agree. Feliciano can even play center. However, i'd prefer to move Ford to guard only if we get a veteran at RT. Granted we can always move Ford back to RG, but that's putting a lot of trust on a young right side."
586,2020-02-05 02:56:28,eyx205,I'm not talking about the Eagles. I'm talking about Washington.
587,2020-02-05 01:23:57,eyx205,"I just realized this mock wasn’t supposed to be taken that seriously, so with that in mind it’s not that unreasonable haha"
588,2020-02-04 22:11:43,eyx205,"Lmao I appreciate that, but I definitely wanna be sure I’m correct in what I’m saying. Just
Something to keep in mind going forward."
589,2020-02-05 14:54:17,eyx205,"Trust me. All in on him as well. Thuney/Spain/Scherff. Even the cheaper options, Finney/Schofield/Garland (center)/Greg Van Roten.

Bears are getting mocked OT pretty often, and rightfully so. But Guard/Center is a much bigger problem. We have Whitehair who can play both, we absolutely need to get a G/C this offseason. Kyle Long retired, and we played a recently converted DL at RG all season. It was a disaster.

Getting an elite G + Bobbie Massie back at RT should help us out tremendously"
590,2020-02-05 14:52:11,eyx205,"I like most of what you said, but please no to Funchess! I see the Panthers North connection but I really dislike him as a player.

This draft is historically great at WR which means two things: there is just a high probability that WR will be a BPA at some point(s) in rounds 1-3 and I personally can see better and much cheaper WR talent all the way in round 3 than Funchess.

That aside, I'd also like an Edge signing like Ngakoue so we aren't pressured into taking a DE high in the draft as well."
591,2020-02-04 21:41:41,eyx205,"Miami has holes to fill that are way more important than RB, get that Oline fixed before taking a RB in the first round"
592,2020-02-05 01:24:52,eyx205,"It’s not a mock, it’s just potential surprise picks each team could make in the first. Each different selection has no correlation to the other"
593,2020-02-05 14:56:21,eyx205,"I don't want Funchess, but I think we will get Funchess. It makes too much sense  

>Edge signing like Ngakoue  

Do you think we would go both RT and edge in FA? I am sure we have the money but would Beane actually do that?"
594,2020-02-04 22:45:33,eyx205,Ok but they still might take 1. You can argue about this all day and nothings going to chnage
595,2020-02-05 15:01:19,eyx205,"Oh please Beane, learn from the Kelvin Benjamin mistake that ex-panthers aren't always the solution.

Speaking of ex-panthers and addressing your second point, Daryl Williams can be a cheap stop gap RT for 1-3 years. I'm sure he will be much cheaper than Conklin and Bulaga. He also poses as an immediate upgrade to either of our RTs."
596,2020-02-05 15:22:00,eyx205,I prefer the cheap options . As much as I want a shiny new RT I do t think the difference in play would be that dramatic to warrant another 30m. I'd rather spend it on our defensive line. Those guys can destroy even the best gameplans
597,2020-02-04 21:25:14,eywqp4,"I wonder if they’ll back off of missionary work and focus on “breeding” (for lack of a better term) their own membership.

Let’s face it, there are like NO converts anymore. The only people getting baptized are the poor 8year olds who “choose” to get baptized.

They might double down on teaching “multiplying and replenishing the earth” and just keeping a tight grip on the members they do have."
598,2020-02-04 21:15:32,eywqp4,"The thing that kind of grinds my gears is that they will spin this as a good thing and that they are the best of the best, but what can you do."
599,2020-02-04 21:50:55,eywqp4,"I've thought of two possibilities. The first is the move towards ultra orthodox weirdness as described beautifally in the post. The members will be rigid, narrowly and fervently focussed on obedience as a sign of worthiness, and further self-seen as seperate and special. Membership will be much smaller and more doubled down and dedicated. More home schoolers, continued patriarchy and, yes, narcissists.
If the church moves towards a more moderate, thoughtful and nuanced belief system, well educated people may find it tolerable and beneficial but many will make the church work for them on their own terms, by their own interpretations and desires for adherence.

In the first instance, membership will shrink. In the second scenario, membership may not go down as far, it'll still shrink but in either case, tithing revenue will dive as the membership decreases. It will go down in the second case as members pick and choose their own workable gospel options. Paying a full tithe may not be a priority. Temple covenants may not be seen for some to be the only way to be connected with loved ones in the afterlife. 

What about BYU? Any thought on what it will look like in 50-100 yrs?"
600,2020-02-04 22:27:23,eywqp4,"Mormonism has always been and will never become more than an irrelevant curiosity outside of the Morridor. What made it seem vigorous was its own very high internal birth rates, which are now approaching, or may have already sunk below replacement. It seems even now to be losing some of it’s sway in it’s own bastions, and that makes my heart sing.

All of the attempts to reinvent itself won’t reinvigorate it because it’s business plan has nothing unique and appealing to offer outsiders and increasingly insiders. 

It may not ‘die’ completely, but it is and will continue to change into something else unrecognizable as the “Mormon” church."

A fear I have is that the main reason they are hoarding hundreds of billions of dollars is to be able to take over the US (as their prophesy states) when the opportunity arises.
I might be paranoid but I’ve heard that prophesy my whole life...that the American govt will hang by a thread and TSCC will save it...and it strikes fear in my heart to think that with their ever growing billions (compared to our divided nation with trillions of debt) they truly could be in charge someday😳"
604,2020-02-07 02:47:32,eywqp4,"Yes, the church will trend towards orthodoxy.

But it won't look like the Warren Jeffs orthodoxy.  To understand what it will look like, just look to the current obsessions of the current First Presidency, and take it to an extreme - that's what it will look like.

1. A doubling-down of the church's obsession with sexual minorities.  I expect them to end up being driven out of the church - quite unapologetically.
2. An extreme emphasis on discipline and an increasing intolerance towards dissent.  More people will be driven out of the church over even less significant dissenting views.  Excommunication will become more common and even less apologetic.  The people that remain will look ever more like DezNat, and less and less like a legitimate religion.
3. An increasing intolerance towards intellectuals.  All three BYU campuses will become increasingly intolerant of intellectualism and diverse views.  Professors who don't adhere strictly to the church orthodoxy will be increasingly driven out, no matter how respected they are in their disciplines, nor how much they are needed for the intellectual reputation of the campus.
4. As the church's economic fortunes rise and its ecclesiastical fortunes decline, there will be increasingly less attention paid to the ecclesiastical side, and more attention to the investments.  The church will look less and less like a church with an investment pool attached, and more and more like an enormous hedge fund with a dysfunctional little church attached."

606,2020-02-04 21:35:47,eywqp4,Agree. Making baby Mormons is now and has always been the best way to grow the church. Except millenials don't want many kids.

I think the church have passed into negative replacement rate already.  In Utah, of the 2019 population growth of about 56,000, only 6,000 were members.  Imagine what the numbers are like outside of Utah.

617,2020-02-07 02:02:36,eyv5t6,White men can't jump
618,2020-02-04 18:10:08,eyu553,My eyes!!!
619,2020-02-04 18:51:45,eyu553,7 WR going by pick 22 is a tough pill to swallow.
620,2020-02-04 18:08:16,eyu553,You're killing my eyes with this format. It's got to be spaced out.
621,2020-02-04 18:12:13,eyu553,"Dude, format and I don't like the pick because we already invested so much at the DE position."
622,2020-02-04 18:09:53,eyu553,Got damn this formatting
623,2020-02-04 19:14:08,eyu553,I'd say give Gross-Matos to Baltimore. They need pass-rush help and that's even before/if they do resign Judon.
624,2020-02-04 18:28:49,eyu553,"I really don't get the Miami pick. Tua may have injury concerns, but even with those concerns its unlikely that good of a QB prospect falls to 5 any other year. Miami can go OL with any of their 13 other picks, especually if he sits behind Fitzmagic for a year. The dropoff for QBs is much steeper than OL. Even from a job preservation stand point, if your QB of the future from round 2 doesn't pan out or if Tua is better than who you picked, you're out of a job."
625,2020-02-04 18:34:42,eyu553,"Humphrey returned to school, also I seriously doubt we draft Queen hes way too light for our liking we basically don't play LBs under 235 outside of ST."
626,2020-02-04 19:01:39,eyu553,Why is everyone rating Queen so high all of the sudden? He has a lot of flaws and physical negatives. He had a decent championship game but I don't think it was enough to make a mid day 2 pick into a top 25 pick. Is it just because it's a bad year for LBs?
627,2020-02-04 18:53:50,eyu553,"The Bucs young CBs balled out at the end of the year.

Safety maybe, but not CB.  I would expect O-line or D-Line in that order."
628,2020-02-04 19:02:04,eyu553,"I doubt anyone is going to take Becton with Wirfs still on the board. Becton could very likely flop and Wirfs can start day one. I don't hate AZ going offensive line, but Wirfs is superior IMO. Cleveland would chance it on Becton if the top 3 are gone although I highly doubt they will have to considering Miami is going Tua and the Chargers might also grab a QB.

Gross-Matos also isnt making it to Green Bay (who wouldn't draft him if he fell there anyway). Seattle needs help on the offensive line but edge is their biggest need. I wouldn't complain if we grabbed Jackson, but Gross-Matos seems more likely. If the Hawks dont take him, Baltimore 100% will.

Packers may very well go linebacker or even wide receiver. If those needs aren't there, it wouldn't surprise me if they trade out of the first especially since they lack draft capital this year."
629,2020-02-04 21:04:02,eyu553,You don’t see Herbert going in the 1st round?
630,2020-02-04 22:23:54,eyu553,Miami will take a QB in the first round
631,2020-02-04 20:24:18,eyu553,"I really dont like the vikings going for a safety in the first round. Even if Harris leaves, a mid round pick or a vet should do it while there is a bigger need at CB, OLine or DT."
632,2020-02-05 02:38:55,eyu553,"I like your first two Miami picks. QB can wait a year or two. I imagine another pass rusher or protector in the first. I don't think RB's start coming off the board til the 2nd. I like Swift and Taylor over Dobbins too.

I keep dreaming we trade down with Carolina. They take Tua and we take Isaiah Simmons AND Chaisson."
633,2020-02-05 05:11:38,eyu553,"Most important position in Patricia's D is the nose tackle. Second most important position is the corner. 

But I would be SHOCKED if he bets his job on a rookie at either position."
634,2020-02-04 19:10:34,eyu553,It is but that's how deep and talented this WR class is.
635,2020-02-05 15:52:10,eyu553,It's an insane draft class for the position though. Unlikely but not impossible.
636,2020-02-04 18:16:25,eyu553,Fixed
637,2020-02-04 18:17:18,eyu553,I wasn't sure who else to give them with no more first round receivers on the board they go BPA.
638,2020-02-04 19:24:23,eyu553,I would say Baltimore or Seattle. Wouldn't shock me if the Ravens leapfrog a couple spots to land him.
639,2020-02-04 18:32:27,eyu553,That's fair but Tua as a prospect kinda scares me. He has an injury history and he played with elite talent at Alabama. There is no telling how he is gonna play with talent that isn't elite. I question whether or not he is the type of guy who can elevate the talent around him. Until its certain that he is 100 percent healthy I dont think the dolphins are a good fit because of there lack of talent offensively.
640,2020-02-04 18:48:31,eyu553,Fixed that pick it is now Grant Delpit. I think The Patriots overlook the size concern in favor of a potentially very good cover man.
641,2020-02-04 19:12:22,eyu553,I like Queen because it seemed like every play in the national championship  he was around the ball. I also think he is gonna have a great combine.
642,2020-02-04 19:11:31,eyu553,I almost gave them Delpit but In my opinion good corners can make average safeties look really good and I'm waiting to see what they do with all of there d line free agents.
643,2020-02-04 19:13:56,eyu553,I think it's time for Seattle to get Russ some o line help. And with them picking Collier last year I dont think they go back to back DE. I do agree with you on Becton but I think he is gonna have a good combine for a guy his size and shoot up boards.
644,2020-02-04 21:17:41,eyu553,"With the emphasis that Ballard puts on the Senior Bowl, I would be shocked if the Colts pass on Herbert."
645,2020-02-04 22:22:00,eyu553,"I disagree a lot. We have only 1 safety on roster next year, but arguably decent depth at CB. Sure Rhodes looked like ass, but unless you forecast him getting cut on top of is losing our CBs 2 and 3 then I don't think they go CB in the first and rely on Hughes and Hill to step up.   
OL is tough as there aren't good tackles at the end of the first and it's an over pay for any of the iOL guys there.  
DT (3T) has been a ""need"" since Floyd got hurt yet we always make due because we coach DLine talent well.   
I actually really like Delpit, and while going from Harris to him may or may not be an upgrade, it's a move we might need to make with our cap.  
Tl;Dr before FA where we likely cut people, Safety is a viable option for the Vikes"
646,2020-02-04 19:40:36,eyu553,"We would take BPA, not fill a need anyway.  Especially not that deep unless for some reason we had Reagor super high on our board."
647,2020-02-05 17:18:14,eyu553,"I think that can go 2 ways though, talented and deeper position classes sometimes make teams feel they can wait and get a really talented guy at that position for good value in the 2-4 round range, allowing them to grab a higher-level player at a less deep position in the first. Need/fit obviously plays in."
648,2020-02-04 18:28:33,eyu553,Kenneth Murray
649,2020-02-04 18:31:58,eyu553,"Kenneth Murray would be the better investment, or trade to the top of the 2nd round with a team who is looking to come back into the 1st."
650,2020-02-04 18:55:05,eyu553,I mean we haven't in the past to my knowledge we haven't really played any LBs under like 235-240
651,2020-02-04 19:14:32,eyu553,"Fair enough, the amount of FAs on the D-line is kind of insane.  Whatever they do there will shape their draft strategy."
652,2020-02-04 19:23:26,eyu553,"Collier is absolute garbage and just about every Hawks fan lost their shit as soon as he was picked. It's a similar situation to Jackson.

Seattle's O-Line isnt egregious. It was terrible after injuries riddled them, but early in the season we were holding our own. Duane Brown is great when he plays as is Justin Britt. Ifedi and Iupati need to go. But we had one of the lowest pressure rates in the NFL. Ansah had 2.5 sacks. We need pressure even if Clowney signs with us. Wilson has dealt with bad o-lines for a long time.

Seattle has a ton of picks this year. We can mix and mash draft picks on the o-line but we need a bonafide stud on the edge."
653,2020-02-05 04:48:48,eyu553,I’d be fine to pass on love if ceedee falls to us but there’s no way ballard wouldn’t snatch herbert up that late
654,2020-02-05 12:14:37,eyu553,"I really dont see the depth at CB. Rhodes will most likely be cut (and I hope we do so) Waynes is a FA and Alexander is a FA. So our only notable players left are Hughes and Holton Hill. One has a problem with injuries and the other with ""substances"". In my eyes there is a big ? at CB. At Safety we could either resign Harris (great but expensive) or just go with the HumanTorpedo again, Dejo wouldnt be the best option but he knows the team and was an okayish guy the last years.

For DT i really think we need someone who is able to pressure the opposing QB more, Linval is great against the run but lacks QBpressure in my eyes.

I'm not saying we shouldnt get a Safety during the draft or FA but I dont think we should spend a first round pick on it."
655,2020-02-05 00:41:11,eyu553,"I mean if this is how the board ran I’d hope we either went top rb or trade down. Honestly though, I doubt 6 receivers are going to go by us. Past few years haven’t shown teams are going to go that nuts on them. And the 2017 class really tilted takin one top 10."
656,2020-02-05 00:54:09,eyu553,"I wouldn't reach for a RB as that's not a high need, I'd def go BPA though, regardless of position except maybe QB or DT"

I don't rule out a qb in the round 3 area (Eason, Hurts, Gordon, Fromm) but I just don't see giving up a future first to move up and get Love. There is no pressure to win right away. I think Bill will build the team as he normally would and then try and develop a mid round qb. If they all suck maybe they'll end up with a high enough pick to go and get an elite prospect that he loves but I don't see Love being that guy at pick 9"
682,2020-03-28 12:35:54,fqi2es,"Packers trade up to draft Reagor, draft a Qb in round 2 and don’t draft an ilb in the first 3 rounds??? WTF"
683,2020-03-28 12:51:35,fqi2es,"As a lions fan, my pp is hard"
684,2020-03-28 13:27:31,fqi2es,If the Chiefs draft RB and WR in the first three rounds without addressing the CB position (our biggest need by far) then I would be pissed.
685,2020-03-28 12:46:36,fqi2es,I don't like us taking a TE over a CB at all considering we just lost our CB1 and essentially spent a 2nd on Hurst
686,2020-03-28 13:51:31,fqi2es,"I appreciate the effort but our LB group is one of the best in the NFL. Jayon Brown and Rashaan Evans are amazing inside and David Long Jr is a nice number 3. Murray's a good player but we have much more pressing needs at OT, CB, DL and EDGE."
687,2020-03-28 15:49:30,fqi2es,This seems really bad for a lot of teams lol. Appreciate the effort tho
688,2020-03-28 12:03:15,fqi2es,K.J. Hamler over Kenneth Murray or Patrick Queen for the Ravens...this is probably the worst pick possible for the Ravens who need LBs since we only have L.J. Fort as a starter right now.
689,2020-03-28 12:20:47,fqi2es,"I like this mock, only thing is that the seahawks dont pick corners Rd2 and Arnette does not meet their strict arm length requirements (32""). I'd love it if we got an OT with that pick"
690,2020-03-28 13:35:46,fqi2es,"While edge depth is certainly a huge concern in Cleveland, I don’t think you can spend both 3rds on edge if you doubled down on tackle at 10 and 41. There’s too big of holes at LB and FS to ignore on day 2. A pick of Curtis Weaver or Marlon Davidson at 41, followed by Malik Harrison at 74 and Ashtyn Davis at 97 would’ve been a near perfect draft for Cleveland imo. With the Conklin signing I don’t think there’s as much of a need to grab 2 tackles early, I’d rather grab a developmental tackle some time on day 3 and spend day 2 upgrading the defense."
691,2020-03-28 15:39:11,fqi2es,"Pretty bad mock for Denver. If Ruggs is gone, I like the Henderson pick. But that's about the knot thing I like about this mock. Broncos need a speedy wr, and Tee Higgins is pretty much the opposite of that. Plus they have a big need at iOL that doesnt get addressed at all. And taking an iDL when Hennesey is on the board in the 3rd makes no sense whatsoever."
692,2020-03-28 17:23:50,fqi2es,Jags would never trade up for that crap
693,2020-03-28 14:46:04,fqi2es,"Packers are definitely not taking a QB that early. We’d be kicking Rodgers out early due to the rookie contract being extremely valuable, and is a waste of a draft pick. 

Trading up for Reagor is also questionable. His draft stock went down due to combine performance, so he’d be there at 30, or there are very comparable talent at 30."
694,2020-03-28 14:57:40,fqi2es,Shenault plays way too similar of a role to Parris Campbell for it to make sense for us to draft him. Mims or Higgins would be much better fits that give us something our WR corps doesn't currently have.
695,2020-03-28 15:04:19,fqi2es,"Mock is pretty good for Seattle. YGM is a good pick in the first. I believe Seattle would prefer Julian Okwara at 59 rather than Zack Baun, as Baun is more of a 3-4 OLB, and Seattle needs a Leo. Arnette pick is awful, he has T-Rex arms. Seattle has never drafted a CB with shorter than 32” arms ever, and the earliest they have ever taken a CB is late 3rd. Plus, with the addition of Quinton Dunbar, CB is all but off the table for the first two days"
696,2020-03-28 15:39:42,fqi2es,"Baun is far too small to be a pass rusher in the NFL and he doesn't meet any of our linebacker athletic thresholds. If we needed another DE, we'd go Okwara probs. Though if we already went YGM in R1, Driscoll or another tackle (where we have zero young depth) is likely

Never say never but Seattle hasn't drafted a corner before the back end of the 3rd round under PCJS either, and we've never taken an outside corner with arms under 32"". We love our 2nd round receivers so Pittman or Johnson is possible there, Cushenberry also with needing to move on from Britt sooner rather than later."
697,2020-03-28 16:18:33,fqi2es,Pretty comical to see the Giants GM take a safety and watch the next two picks be a LB and a Center.
698,2020-03-28 18:07:54,fqi2es,"Man, I couldn't pass on this haul any harder. It's really objectively poor. Hamler would be a reach at 28 even in a less loaded class, then add to that Murray and Queen still on the board and that's a pick worthy of an F-. And the first sentence of the description is just wrong, a slot guy is exactly what we don't need at WR. Snead is a slot specialist and we use Hollywood and Andrews in the slot a ton as well. We need outside WRs, not slot."
699,2020-03-28 14:19:37,fqi2es,Would have loved a safety or Linebacker in there but I ain’t mad at this. We get two tackles and hopefully with Bill Callahan’s coaching we are set for the foreseeable future there and we also bolster our DL (would probably pick one and use the other pick on a safety). Good shit OP.
700,2020-03-28 14:26:15,fqi2es,I actually really like this for the Cardinals well done
701,2020-03-28 14:35:51,fqi2es,"Hate it. The Chiefs lost two starting corners. If they don’t come out of the draft with a starter, it’s a massive failure. Any mocker failing to recognize this has, in turn, provided us a shit mock."
702,2020-03-28 14:38:31,fqi2es,"Awful draft for the Browns. Nailed the first pick then whiffed on the next 3. The Browns signed Jack Conklin in FA. So unless you want Naing to kick into OG, that is an OT that's just going to gather dust as a backup for 3 years minimum. Getting one rotational edge might be nice, but Chad Thomas showed flashes last year. Not addressing FS at all without one on the roster in the first place is a massive misstep. The big needs for Cleveland atm are: LT, FS, LB, SS, RG, backup EDGE, 3rd WR, iDL depth, H-back in that order."
703,2020-03-28 17:13:33,fqi2es,"Love Kinlaw, the rest of this not so much. CB is by far our biggest need but you have us using ANOTHER 2nd round pick (remember the Falcons just traded a 2nd for Hurst) for a TE who easily is a 3rd/4th round talent, all while players like Bryce Hall and Noah Igbinoghene are still there."
704,2020-03-29 17:20:55,fqi2es,"Great draft for the lions, would prefer to stay put at 35 and take Mims (or maybe Austin Jackson) or take Aiyuk at 40 Bc I think both guys are gonna be studs"
705,2020-03-29 18:10:19,fqi2es,Don’t have much to say other than I really like what you did with the Cowboys picks. I’m SUPER high on Fulton so picking him at 20 is perfect for me
706,2020-04-02 09:16:03,fqi2es,"Love the draft for the Lions, although I think they would look to pick up a DT in the third over a CB or LB. The LB room is pretty full nowadays."
707,2020-03-28 17:48:13,fqi2es,"This, but I do love Kmet in the third"
708,2020-03-28 12:48:46,fqi2es,"Perhaps this is true but again, this is what I would do and I think Love is significantly better than any of those other guys and worth moving up for. They just resigned a whole bunch of guys and I feel this roster is definitely still ready to compete."
709,2020-03-28 12:53:33,fqi2es,"Yes, looking back on the Eason pick I'm not really a huge fan of it, but oh well. If anything should've taken an ILB with the Eason pick but I really like Reagor as a receiver and think he was well worth trading up for and Wilson in round 3 provides a replacement for Bulaga who you also lost to free agency."
710,2020-03-28 13:44:11,fqi2es,"I don't blame you, I nearly went Gladney at 32 but I think Queen is that much better so I took him. Dobbins felt like the BPA and a need for KC and then I thought Duvernay would get more of a role than any CB prospect available than in this very suspect CB class."
711,2020-03-28 12:59:04,fqi2es,"To be really honest, this was a poor pick from me. Totally forgot about Hurst and would've picked an Arnette or Jaylon Johnson. Sorry man"
712,2020-03-28 14:01:17,fqi2es,"At 1.29 it was BPA for me with the Titans. Didn’t realise the linebacking depth that the Titans had but don’t necessarily think Tennessee has ‘one of the best’ linebacking cores in the league. there wasn’t really anyone worth taking over Murray besides maybe Diggs? Besides with Murray now on the Titans, their linebacking core is no longer as you say ‘one of the best’ but now with Murray they are the ‘best’ linebacking core in the league in your eyes."
713,2020-03-28 12:25:04,fqi2es,"Agree.  I like Hamler but there’s a 0% chance they take him in the 1st with Murray AND Queen on the board.

I do like the Marlon Davidson and Okwara picks tho."
714,2020-03-28 12:33:22,fqi2es,This is a very valid point and perhaps I should've gone Murray but I will say I think WR is the more pressing need - the Ravens d-line and safety core is outstanding and what will win them more games is drafting a speedy slot receiver that can consistently beat coverage. A WR class like this doesn't come around often and Lamar will greatly appreciate Hamler's skillset.
715,2020-03-28 12:43:32,fqi2es,I considered OT at pick 63 but I was more looking for value more than anything. I appreciate it’s an un-Seahawks pick but for me at least I was going BPA and for Arnette to still be available at the end of the 2nd when many view him as a top 40 player I figured I couldn’t pass up that value.
716,2020-03-28 13:40:54,fqi2es,"I think O-line (and maybe coaching?) is really all this team needs to be a playoff contender so I did choose to heavily invest in OT and take Niang who I've seen in the first round in some mocks at 41. Greenard was specifically to target EDGE and I really like his length and fit in Cleveland. Zuniga maybe could've been Davis (not a massive fan of Harrison) but for me, Zuniga felt like the BPA and I'd rather continue to build a monster d-line with a plethora of players I can rotate."
717,2020-03-28 14:48:54,fqi2es,"I’ll let the packers gm answer as well but he’s going to agree that in hindsight, Eason wasn’t the best option. However we are both quite high on Reagor and will defend the trade up - I personally have Reagor at 18 on my big board (speed, hands, ball skills all amazing imo)"
718,2020-03-28 15:01:17,fqi2es,"I definitely disagree, I’m a fan of Campbell but he’s very much a speed threat in my mind. Shenault is much more of a all around athlete. Maybe Higgins is a good idea but I’m really not a fan of him that high."
719,2020-03-28 14:45:57,fqi2es,Thanks man
720,2020-03-28 14:37:02,fqi2es,I believe if you draft for need that’s a failure and no CB was worth taking at 32.
721,2020-03-28 14:45:47,fqi2es,"I really do think the Browns need the oline to work and then everything else will come together and this team can fulfil their potential. Yes FS is important but if it were my, I’d choose to invest heavily in the oline."
722,2020-03-28 18:41:08,fqi2es,Kmet making it to the 3rd would be a steal
723,2020-03-28 13:47:10,fqi2es,The question isn’t is love better than those other guys it’s is he better than NEXT years QBs who could be available and personally I don’t think so.
724,2020-03-28 13:13:15,fqi2es,"I don’t have a problem with drafting Reagon, but imo we could have drafted him at 30. And I like Wilson in the 3rd round"
725,2020-03-28 13:03:08,fqi2es,"I personally would prefer Eason over a Malik Harrison, for example."
726,2020-03-28 14:09:30,fqi2es,Agree to disagree.
727,2020-03-28 13:00:00,fqi2es,"It's fine, I frequently forget who needs what and who I sent where when I'm making my mocks too"
728,2020-03-28 17:12:51,fqi2es,"BPA only works if that player is able to get on the field. Brown, Evans and Long are all off-ball LBs - as is Murray. Teams spend most of their time these days in nickel packages - rarely do you ever see more than 3 off ball LBs on the field at once, and usually it's just 2. 

For a player to provide value, he needs to actually play. Murray is kind of a useless pick for TEN, A) he wouldn't play many snaps and B) he'd prevent a decent player from getting any snaps."
729,2020-03-28 12:29:47,fqi2es,"Yeah, I really like the Davidson and Okwara picks for us, just would change our 1st pick and its a really good draft."
730,2020-03-28 12:41:56,fqi2es,"While I agree that we do need another WR, our core WR group isn't as bad off as our LB group and if we want to cover TEs or RBs coming over the middle, stuffing the run, or blitzing like we do then we'll need that good coverage LB to go with Fort. Since this WRs class has a good amount of good players and the LBs group is okay, then I think we would take the LB in this situation. We also usually do BPA and going for K.J. Hamler in the 1st is a reach imo especially when you have Shenault and Mims going after him.

Overall great job on your mock draft!"
731,2020-03-28 14:53:31,fqi2es,"The defense in its current form is not a playoff contender, even with an improved OL and coaching staff. Our LB core currently consists of Mack Wilson who was below average, Sione Takitaki who played 100 snaps last season, and BJ Goodson who’s an aging vet that probably qualifies as serviceable. We don’t even have a FS on the roster. I get the premise of a monster DL but there’s only so much a DL can do when your back 7 is as bad as the Browns back 7 is currently slated to be. You’re relying heavily on both Takitaki and Wilson making a huge jump and one of Sendejo or Sheldrick Redwine to be a serviceable FS."
732,2020-03-28 15:32:11,fqi2es,"I meant more in the role they play. Campbell and Shenault are both more gadget/slot receivers, even though they do it in very different ways. We need someone that can be more of a downfield threat than either of them, and our WR corps has been lacking a good, big body receiver for a long time."
733,2020-03-28 14:38:25,fqi2es,"Then you’re suggesting that the Chiefs are going in to 2020 with two starting positions unfilled. Don’t be ridiculous. There are plenty of quality corners you skipped over.

Edit: you picked Gladney 5 picks after the Chiefs first. You picked Arnette and Hall in the immediate picks after their second. 

Another point of order, the Chiefs will NOT invest in a high round selection at running back. It simply will not happen."
734,2020-03-28 14:50:40,fqi2es,"Yes but they did invest heavily on the OL in FA. The signed one of the best RTs in the NFL to play RT. Drafting Thomas would fill the LT spot. Then you have an OL of Thomas, Bitonio, Tretter, Forbes/Teller/Hubbard, and Conklin. The point is drafting Niang is a wasted pick as unless you're putting him at RG, which I would never do. Now if you think that they need to address the RG spot, then someone like Ruiz or Bidiaz at 41 makes sense. But it would be better to fill the FS spot at 41, take a LB or SS at 74 and then nab Lemieux at 97."
735,2020-03-28 13:49:59,fqi2es,"Love would be great in next year's class as well but if it is me running the team like I'm doing in this mock, I'll take Love and not wait a year with this loaded defense."
736,2020-03-28 13:52:14,fqi2es,"Also factoring into this is that I, personally am not a fan of Stidham. Graded him 6th round last year - don't think he's the answer but not obviously the Pats did so what do I know lol"
737,2020-03-28 13:16:47,fqi2es,He might've been there. This receiving class is stacked and we had 6 receivers go in the first so was more a matter of ensuring I got the guy that I wanted.
738,2020-03-28 14:11:23,fqi2es,As in I don’t blame you for having a problem with not picking a corner- obviously more of a need than CB. Was just trying to explain the opportunity never arose.
739,2020-03-28 13:10:31,fqi2es,"You guys are probably right, I think in hindsight LB is the smarter pick. As for BPA, my personal opinion is Hamler was the best player available because his ball skills and hands are amazing and a team like Baltimore could really use a speedy guy like him. I guess I was excited about the fit I conceptualized and overlooked the true need."
740,2020-03-28 14:59:05,fqi2es,Yeah in hindsight I would’ve gone win field at 41 and then RG and LB/SS with 74 and 97. I do think there’s some merit to OL but the defence does need help.
741,2020-03-28 15:33:51,fqi2es,Right you mean more of a Justin Jefferson/lamb kind of player
742,2020-03-28 15:34:21,fqi2es,Probably could’ve thought about WR type a bit more
743,2020-03-28 14:43:33,fqi2es,Would rather have queen then Gladney or Diggs and Jaylon Johnson vs Dobbins was a very hard choice but I ended up going with the BPA.
744,2020-03-28 14:57:01,fqi2es,"I think in hindsight what I’d do is take winfield at 41, Hennessy at 74 and a Lb like Dye at 97. What do you think?"
745,2020-03-28 21:07:53,fqi2es,"> they can’t waste this still excellent roster with Brian Hoyer or Jarrett Stidham at QB

This quote and this comment suggest there's a pretty strong disconnect between where you see the Patriots and where I see the Patriots.  
  
We've lost 2,700 snaps on defense between Van Noy, Collins, Harmon and Shelton. We have nobody signed to play EDGE LB right now, and we don't have the personnel to transition back to a 4-3 base (we'd need to add a few DL and that move would alienate Chase Winovich). This ""loaded"" defense is, in reality, a loaded secondary (with genuine age/injury concerns at safety) and a skeleton crew front 7. That is, a front 7 that got ran over for 200 yards the last time it was on the field and then lost KVN, Collins and Danny Shelton.   
  
That secondary should be good enough to produce a decent to good final product on defense, but replicating last year's results (which were amplified by a comically weak schedule and preying on young, inexperienced or outright bad QBs - Rosen, Falk, McCoy, Jones, Darnold, Baker, Dalton - then returned merely ""very good"" results against teams with respectable offenses) is an impossible task, and that's what it's going to take if the team is going to compete because the offense could be one of the worst in the league. It's a good OL if everyone is healthy (that includes getting an all clear on David Andrews that we still don't have, and if we don't get it we have no center), it's a solid if unspectacular RB group and.... that's it. The TE situation is the worst in the NFL, the WR group is among the worst in the NFL and whoever the QB ends up being will be asked to make up for that.
  
All told it's massive, immediate needs at EDGE, TE, WR with slightly less immediate needs at LB, DL and S that will become glaring if we don't take steps to get ahead of the problem and a potential for immediate need at Center pending results of medical testing for Andrews, who will not have played football in 18 months by the time the season rolls around.  

You and I very clearly have different opinions on Love, so while I don't want to just assume I'm right and you're wrong about him, what exactly is it that you see that makes him worth a future first, a third and a fourth for a team that has significant and immediate needs at so many other positions? I've been going crazy seeing him mocked to us so often down at 23, but paying up a future 1st and two other picks in the top 4 rounds just on the prayer that he can be good enough as a rookie when thrown into such a terrible offensive situation to not waste a year of the aging and shallow defense is the kind of thing that can set a franchise back half a decade or more."
746,2020-03-28 14:15:13,fqi2es,"Well that isn’t quite true. You just chose RB instead. I understand as that is perceived from the outside as a position of need for the Chiefs. Within the organization though, I don’t get that feeling. Reid doesn’t invest high picks there as the guys that fit his system generally are available later in the draft."
747,2020-03-28 13:13:24,fqi2es,"That's the fun of doing mocks, fitting players with teams we think they would have the best chance of succeeding or just because you want to build teams for a future dynasty. Great job and keep up the good work!"
748,2020-03-28 15:07:56,fqi2es,"Yeah don’t get me wrong, the OL still needs depth in a bad way. If one player goes down there really isn’t serviceable backup at any position. Just with the signing of Conklin I don’t think it’s quite as pressing to go back to back on OT in the 1st two rounds"
749,2020-03-28 14:48:12,fqi2es,"Then your mock leaves the Chiefs fielding 9 defenders. They have no starters except Charvarious Ward. Rashad Fenton is a 6th round selection from last season that played a lot at slot once injuries hit the unit. They have no other drafted talent among their corners. Mark it down, the Chiefs will address this spot and any mocker that fails to recognize this is not giving their best effort. Your round two choice needed to go to Arnette or Hall or Igbinoghene, none of which are reaches."
750,2020-03-28 15:00:57,fqi2es,"Not bad, personally I would go with your board Winnfield at 41, Chinn at 74, and Lemieux at 97. Then look at LBs in the 4th since we have an early 4th rounder. Although I wouldn't be upset with Winnfield at 41, Davis Gaither at 74, and Lemieux at 97 with eyes on SS in R4."
751,2020-03-28 23:48:38,fqi2es,">You and I very clearly have different opinions on Love, so while I don't want to just assume I'm right and you're wrong about him, what exactly is it that you see that makes him worth a future first, a third and a fourth for a team that has significant and immediate needs at so many other positions?

This, especially given that Stidham at least had two years in the SEC, vs. Love in the Mountain West."
752,2020-03-28 15:32:52,fqi2es,Yeah this is a fair point. The idea of a Hall or a similar CB there is quite appealing as well.
753,2020-03-28 13:13:57,fqi2es,Thanks man
754,2020-03-28 15:10:13,fqi2es,"This is probably where our fundamental disagreement is but I’m sure you know more about this team as I’ve only realised just how weak S, LB truly is."
755,2020-03-28 14:53:04,fqi2es,"Firstly Ward is very underrated. Also I admit, CB is definitely a need they will be addressing, just didn’t work out in this one. The idea of Dobbins enticed me but you’re right someone like Hall is probably the better pick."
756,2020-03-28 15:02:21,fqi2es,China has some question marks in my mind and so does Davis Gaither. Both too high for me at 74.
757,2020-03-28 15:03:11,fqi2es,Ended up picking Chinn around 90 and still feeling iffy about that
758,2020-03-28 15:49:19,fqi2es,"Yeah safety and LB are pretty dire. At the price he signed for in JAX I think many Browns fans would’ve preferred we resigned Schobert to shore up the LB room. As far as FS goes in FA, we could still opt to bring back Randall but there seems to be some bad blood there after some locker room issues last year. I’d prefer we address one of those two in FA still so we can focus more on BPA in the middle rounds"
759,2020-03-28 15:12:55,fqi2es,"One last point. The Chiefs have the second fewest dollars devoted to corners in the league (the Panthers are worse). Their highest paid corner is the journeyman they just signed, Antonio Hamilton, a guy who is known for his play on special teams, not his corner play. Veach will rebalance the roster, expending less on wideouts and more on corners."
760,2020-03-28 15:04:02,fqi2es,"Unfortunately based on your board there isn't a ton of need meets talent. I'm a huge fan of Chinn and Davis Gaither, and wouldn't mind getting one of them before 97, when both would be gone."
761,2020-03-28 15:15:14,fqi2es,Also the chiefs have the least cap space left of any team so even more important they address corner in draft.
762,2020-03-28 15:05:46,fqi2es,Would prefer Brandon Jones over chinn. I’m planning to watch more games of chinn soon.
763,2020-03-28 15:10:41,fqi2es,"I just don't see a massive need to take a WR for Cleveland. We have OBJ and Landry a couple decent bottom of the roster guys like Hodge and Ratley. We could use a 3rd WR, but Stefanski isn't much for 3 WR sets hence why Hooper was a prime FA target in Cleveland. Personally, with Karl Joseph on a 1y deal, and the rise of Nickel defenses playing 3 safties I think it's necessary to get a 3rd safety we feel comfortable with. I wouldn't hate Ashyton Davis at 41 either as you could put Winnfield as the slot safety on nickel packages and bring Davis to play the high safety"
764,2020-03-28 15:13:35,fqi2es,Brandon Jones the Safety from Texas
765,2020-03-28 15:14:28,fqi2es,Ah ok yeah got him mixed up with Colin Johnson

768,2020-03-28 22:59:26,fqhoqh,"Yeah I have seen this programs but I don’t think they are making a lot from that.  
Thanks for your response anyway"
769,2020-03-28 11:02:26,fqhk16,"After last year's WC Rohit has more or less cemented himself as an ODI legend. With Tendulkar it's difficult because he's also associated with a lot of things like first player to make an ODI 200, winning the world cup, singlehandedly bearing India in the late nineties and of course the desert storm wizardry. Rohit is great, but not sure if the total sum of his achievements can quite counter the Little Master's."
770,2020-03-28 12:50:22,fqhk16,"Asks the question 

> Did Sachin in fact face Akram, Donald, Waqar, Ambrose and McGrath more than Rohit faced Cummins, Starc, Steyn, Boult

Your own post says Sachin faced McGrath 22 times, Wasim 16 times and Waqar 17 times. You conveniently left out Murali in this list though the legend has 534 wickets and yet Sachin averages 63 being dismissed only 3 times. Whereas Rohit has literally played Starc et al for a small handful of times.

The rest of your post, IMO, is window-dressing.

The only difference the arrival of Rohit has made? That if I had to pick an all-time India ODI XI I would now pick him to partner Sachin over Saurav or Sehwag."
771,2020-03-28 11:31:23,fqhk16,Another thing to remember is the longevity Tendulkar's career had. The guy played a lot of matches for a lot of years. Rohit is great but he hasn't played nearly as enough matches as Tendulkar.
772,2020-03-28 19:19:51,fqhk16,"Tendulkar would've been as destructive, if not more, had he played in the modern era. Rohit on the other hand, looks absoutely clueless even at the hint of swing, if he had played in the 90s with such challenging pitches then he would be a walking wicket. Someone like Colin de Grandhomme looks like a very easy bowler to score, but if he played on pitches that suited bowlers then he would be a real threat (see WC19 Final where a bowling pitch made him look like Sir Curtly Ambrose).

The difference is that Rohit is a great of only his generation, while Tendulkar is an all-time great."
773,2020-03-29 00:45:18,fqhk16,"Using your logic, does that mean Rohit Sharma is better than Viv Richards as well? 


Let’s be honest. West Indies was the only team that could actually play ODIs decently while other teams were struggling with the transition from Test cricket to ODI cricket."
774,2020-03-28 11:00:22,fqhk16,"Game has changed bro can't compare Sachin with Rohit

775,2020-03-29 00:43:34,fqhk16,"Sachin will always be held higher 

1. Sachin played in a tougher era with a bunch of match fixers

2. As good as Rohit is, he will be always second best to his own team mate

3. Sachin was a legend in Test cricket as well"

780,2020-03-28 17:02:03,fqhk16,"Rohit is also very lucky.We also have drs now btw , he was dropped 4 times times below 10 in WC and he scored a century each time. Powerplays ,2 new balls and still wasn't able to break sachins record of most runs in a WC and let us not forget that David Warner was just 1 run behind him.

He's a legend no doubt just pointing it out

Sachin on the other hand wrongly given out soon many times."
781,2020-03-28 13:04:32,fqhk16,"Quick question, did you read the whole thing or at least most of it, or did you look at the numbers and then assumed I was saying Rohit > Sachin? Cause I didn't compare them face to face. If anything it was a comparison on eras. Cricinfo was the one comparing the players I stated and used as examples, and I went with what majority of the answers were.

Now regarding why I apparently left out Murali? Well, here is why. Firstly that's what the arguments on social media listed. They didn't list Muralitharan. Secondly Murali isn't going to open the bowling against Sachin. It will be Vaas and mostly likely Zoysa as I pointed out. You would if you read the thing noted why Starc featured less and why Wasim and Waqar weren't in the most matches played against. Heck they barely opened together. One of them was either with Aaqid Javed or Shoaib Akhtar.

If you want to take it as Sachin v. Rohit, go nuts. Cause I noted the positives and negatives for each era."
782,2020-03-28 13:08:00,fqhk16,For sure and I did note that. Of course Tendulkar would have played more plus he had those really stupid random tri series that he played. Feel bad for him. I wouldn't want to play a tough series at him and then go to Sharjah to play an ODI series and then fly to Dhaka.

785,2020-04-01 13:46:43,fqhk16,"Rohit is currently matching Kohli in ODIs. He's been averaging like 59 since last few years which is almost same to Kohli's. 

Also there's not much difference between the number of centuries they scored in last few years, Rohit scoring 28 and 29 for Kohli."

Yes it's pretty fucking clear he played one more still one behind
Rohit>Warner

But Rohit dropped 4 times still only a run ahead
You be like
Rohit>Warner

Cuz muh Rohit no fault he got dropped 

See the thing is
If Rohit wasn't lucky he wouldn't be the top run scorer, but who knows he might have done big in the semis.
But he ran out of luck"

I know it's not scheduled to be on this week when I looked yesterday, but that doesn't mean the network couldn't change the schedule on a whim. 

There are tons of shows that got cut down to 13ish episodes in the 07-08 year because of the writers strike that was going on, so this would be a lot like that. If they won't be able to finish production, episode 16 could be viewed as a finale since it wrapped Lucy's story and to me that would be preferable to them putting out a few more episodes with no ending. They were originally slated for 22 episodes."
800,2020-03-28 14:28:29,fqevjm,"The guy that took the part of Lucy's skull was detective Abe Tamura (Kanen's replacement at the police station). It wasn't Owen, but the actors do look a little similar in mysterious lighting. 

I did see an interview of the writers that they originally intended to have the rest of the season to wrap up the Aglaeca storyline(17-22?). I imagine quite a bit is going to get cut. I almost wish they would release the script of what was supposed to happen. The writing of the plot has actually been pretty good on this show. 

As for who pays the toll, they've certainly set it up so the toll could mean Nancy, Owen or George (or more than one). It's Nancy's show, so she'll probably be safe. Honestly, I hope it's Owen. I rewatched the series over the last few days and he comes across as a very charming psychopath.

I really wonder if Owen was even taking the Aglaeca seriously. Did he know what he was walking into? I think he just wanted the brownie points to win Nancy's trust. 

&#x200B;

>I honestly think Owen has become the Aglaeca in physical form

This is an interesting thought. Why would you need six people to be part of the ritual if only of them gets their wish granted? Sure, there's a historical/traditional aspect of the legend, but it's still odd. Is it so the Aglaeca has more options for who pays the toll? Or is it because each (or at least several) of the six pay some form of toll in different ways such as a body for the Aglaeca?"
801,2020-03-28 20:32:54,fqevjm,"Yes, the episode may be changed, though it’s title staying the same makes me doubt a recut episode, or at least not much changed."
802,2020-03-28 20:36:27,fqevjm,"Yes, the episode may be changed, though its title staying the same makes me doubt a recut episode, or at least not much is changed.

Lucy’s story’s over, but they still have plotlines I’m very excited to see conclude."
803,2020-03-28 21:21:04,fqevjm,"I don’t think the guy in the car looked at all like the detective, and I’m pretty good at recognizing faces. 

Yes, I do really wish the season could be all 22 episodes...

I do believe Owen will die probably when trying to kill Nancy - maybe Ryan will kill him to save his daughter (perhaps he’s helping to investigate the Aglaeca based on 17s promo), but before that George will be killed by Owen in protecting Nancy. Nancy will be fine, but certainly will get attacked by Owen. The Aglaeca will be affecting the entire group. 

Owen was curious if the legend was true. He had no idea of what would happen. His doubt of the Aglaeca’s existence and power may have made him the toll...

The entire group with likely pay in some way, but why the ritual would need six people for one wish is beyond me. =\

Could S2 be haunted by a ghost from the Marvin’s past misdeeds - Rita maybe? (She may have been implied as a Marvin crime at the Hudson/Marvin dinner)"
804,2020-03-29 02:32:34,fqevjm,"Yeah I'd like to see them conclude storylines from this season, but if they had to they could add them into a season 2 if necessary.  I hope they don't have to, but it's better than getting three more episodes in and then it just ending. If they've not filmed the last few episodes I'm not sure how they could cut what they've got to give it an ending."

828,2020-03-28 00:20:24,fq96y1,"You might have been confused by the fact that there's another Will Smith movie with the title ""I Am Legend"".

Or it could be that you didn't think the title ""I, Robot"" made sense and your brain interpreted it as ""I Am Robot"".

The title ""I, Robot"" is very clear in my memory because it was the same name as the title of the famous story collection by Isaac Asimov and I have always been a huge Asimov fan. Not that the movie had much to do with Asimov's robots, as far as I could tell from the trailer. But they used Asimov's title.

Edit: I see from [the Wikipedia description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Robot_(film)) that there is a slight connection to Asimov: They used his Three Laws of Robotics and retained the character of Susan Calvin. So it's a new story in Asimov's universe."
829,2020-03-28 03:52:25,fq96y1,"Re Robot, be aware the movie is named after an old book.. and the context of ""I, Robot"" is to suggest the humanity of the robot, with robot being said like a name and the concept being about these beings feeling they have an existence, and are not just a thing or a tool...(think like how you might swear an oath and be like ""I, Robert, do solemnly swear"" and the title might make more sense for you). ""I am robot"" would probably give a different feel and context. ""I, Robot"" suggest a sense of agency in the robot, ""I Am Robot"" suggests a sense of identifying with machinery."

925,2020-03-27 17:33:03,fpzdmd,"We did add a lot of players in FA, so we can almost go pure BPA in the draft. Still hoping we get an opportunity to trade down, but DG has never done it once. I wonder if the Judge was in the draft room when Belichick made it a common practice."
926,2020-03-29 01:56:05,fpzdmd,The roster can be salvaged if DG trades down and does not let his ego get in the way of building a decent offensive line.
927,2020-03-28 01:59:42,fpzdmd,"Still a lousy roster but we could improve one side of the ball a lot through this draft. I still believe Simmons is the best multiplier factor out there. Grab him and everyone around him should get better. Take a second-order OT with the second pick and turn him into a professional, competent, player by Year 2."
928,2020-03-27 22:10:08,fpzdmd,"If there was actually going to be a season this year I’d be terrified by this pathetic roster. Year to year it simply never gets better. Gettleman has proved himself inept. 
If the season is played get ready for another 4-12 or worse"
929,2020-03-28 12:19:49,fpzdmd,"my belief that the roster continues to be utter and complete garbage is reinforced by the current spate of FA signings --  DG overpays for marginal and JAG players in the vain hope that they will come here and be more than they ever were, or at least as good as they were someplace else where they were compliments to better players

this is a losing strategy because it its the rare player that suddenly becomes better in new surroundings and because we otherwise have no ""better"" players to begin with that they can at least compliment

so we have to look to the draft for those better players,  which would be fine if Gettleman could actually draft any talent outside a top-10 pick; but he can't

for the past 2 seasons, we have been forced to salivate over 2d tier players like Hernandez, Slayton and Lawrence because all existing players on the team are that much worse - but it doesn't make these second-tier players top top tier ones

and then of course there are the worse still players like Baker, Hill, Carter, Ballentine, etc., who we try to convince ourselves are starting quality guys when wee all know they should be out of the league yesterday

not for nothing we are 3-13, 5-11 and 4-12 over the past 3 seasons

truth is, DG is as lousy a GM as Reese in terms of spotting talent, maybe worse

we are now entering year 3 of his tenure and the o-line is worse than ever; which means that the offense will continue to be terrible; which means Saquon will be wasted again; and which means Daniel Jones will not develop

DG can't spot talent beyond the first round, especially outside the top 10; thus, all you can count on is the first draft pick being talented, even if not the right value pick or the right need for the team

given that every pick after our first selection this season is destined to be a JAG at best, if DG picks anyone other than Young (in a fantasy world where he's still on the board) or Simmons, then he will have blown that pick too.  although we desperately need offensive linemen, especially tackles, and despite there being a slew of promising candidates, all of those candidates won't actually pan out, and whichever one DG picks, should he go that route, is bound to be the one that fails

unless and until DG and the entire scouting department is swept aside and a ""true"" GM descends from heaven, the Giants (and we fans as collateral) are fucked

silver lining?  no season this year so for those who like to pretend, carry on"

As far as free agency goes, I would say the moves were solid. You have to spend money somewhere and it seems like we’re taking the quantity over quality approach. Which makes sense if your roster is barren. And every FA deal could be considered an overpayment because record deals are the norm. If you told me a few years ago that we’d pay $10mil per year for a solid middle LB I would’ve laughed. But these days it’s not that crazy.

I keep going back to this - we can’t get much worse. One of these years we’ll hit on some picks and FAs in the same offseason and bounce back.

954,2020-03-27 15:27:06,fpymz9,"# Rereading The Wind Comes ಠ_ಠ  


*If you’re not ready to analyze Bast playing Kvothe’s flute, you aren’t  a proper KKC fan*

---

My first thought was “I’m not sure I want to do this”, but then I realized that luck was on my side: 

- I already had my baptism of fire years ago, thanks to Richard K Morgan’s *The Steel Remains* and its treacherous sexual scenes. 

- Tehlu being merciful, Kowal m*e*naged to write a story neither morbid nor distasteful. 

- But most importantly, I asked myself: “what if *The Wind Comes* is better than Ademre?” And given that  *everything’s better than Ademre,* I went straight on.

Let’s look at what I’ve found!

&nbsp;


•	**Summary**

It’s biography time at the Waystone Inn, and much to Chronicler’s dismay, Kote needs to tell… a very important story.

A pause from the narration is required, and Kvothe will take a break together with his dear friend Bast. Things are going to get frisky, in the Waystone kitchen!
After all, as the popular saying goes, “a friend in need is a friend  deep in”, or something similar. 

&nbsp;

•	**X**

For the purposes of this reread, X is what awaits Kvothe in the kitchen.

This time, apparently, X should be called XXX.

&nbsp;


•	**Lies**

>I need to tidy the kitchen, anyway

This is a lie! 

Kvothe actually wants an excuse for someone to blow his kazoo!

Notice that he doesn’t bother cleaning the dishes!

>“I keep thinking about what you said about the Cthaeh.” “You should not listen to me, Reshi.” Bast crossed his arms. “I ramble sometimes, and tell tales to make wild mischief. You know that.”

Clearly a lie on Bast’s behalf, as WMF ending will prove.
 
Also, the entire adventure with Penthe’s seems more a cover story to tell Bast it’s pennywhistle time. 

&nbsp;


•	**Adem detail**

When Penthe gulps down Kvothe’s calippo, the text points out:

>And then she hummed, seven notes low and deep in her throat.

Kvothe’s name is not made of seven syllables! 

What was her message? Surely Kowal wants the reader to speculate: is Penthe humming something like “Carceret wants you dead”, ""Tinker Tanner go away"" or some secret code to tell Kvothe that staying in Ademre would be dangerous?

Or was Penthe humming something for real perverts, like the heptatonic scale? Man, proper Adem should really keep some things for themselves!

&nbsp;

Let’s move onto more important issues.

•	**Details worth pointing out**

&nbsp;

•	The long, hard goodbye

>Saying my goodbye to Haert

Clear reprise from WMF 130, the setting of this story. After all, in WMF Kvothe says “I spent a pleasant evening with Penthe,” clearly hinted at the end of *The Wind Comes.*

I find Kowal’s time choice to be perfect: what’s better than some nasty sex with Bast in the kitchen right before going back to Chronicler and talk about what happens to Krin and Ellie? ʘ ͜ʖ ʘ 

&nbsp;

•	Throwback

>He lay his hand against the hollow of Kvothe’s collarbone. “Ah.”

This is a clear throwback to NotW 6!

&nbsp;

* Mistake?

>“There are... There are many types of silences and unless he is more familiar with... with how inns work than I think, he will... he will not notice that this is the wrong—God.”


That’s inconsistent with what  Kvothe says in NotW!

>“I’ve never been in best terms with God”

Kvothe’s not religious!

&nbsp;

•	Poor Bast

>Kvothe dragged his hands away from his face and his gaze, which Bast could not see, was that of a man waiting to die. His trained voice was not. His trained voice was calm, and sated, and a little laughing.

No matter how hard he tries, there’s one thing from his Reshi that he can’t simply lift up: his spirit.

&nbsp;

•	Seven words to make the fandom fall in love with you.

>This does not belong in his book.

^^^Cheeky ^^^Mary ^^^Robinette ^^^Kowal.

&nbsp;

•	Ten words to break  the Kvothe X Bast shippers’ will to live.

>This does not belong in his book. Not at all.

&nbsp;

•	Actually

You can read Kowal’s thoughts [here](http://maryrobinettekowal.com/journal/bit-writing-wind-comes/) and find some curiosities concerning her approach.

&nbsp;

* **The Waystone catalogue**

The Waystone now features…

-	A satisfied innkeeper

-	A satisfied attendant

-	A skeptical scribe

-	The kitchen has a swinging door, tin washing basin and wide window

-	Dishes (still undone – thanks, Bast)

&nbsp;

* **Missed opportunity**

With all my respect for Ms. Kowal, she missed a gigantic opportunity. 
I would have called the story *the Name of the Cock*, for two very good reasons:

-It could interest Bantam Books, given their symbol, and grant some more visibility.

-It could provide some clever wordplay concerning the climax of… the story.


But I can see why she chose *The Wind Blows* instead of the most immediate *The Wind Sucks*, since it could have been taken as a personal attack towards the main series.

&nbsp;

Mr Rothfuss: since you read my posts and commentary, now you know how good I’d be at this stuff. The day charity requires something sex related once again (it happened twice already, we know third time’s the charm) send me a PM and I’ll do the business. 

My Ambrose X Draccus is pure quality I swear, all I need is a stage to shine.

•	**Personal comment**

Objectively: ftw.

956,2020-03-29 02:41:58,fpymz9,"Regarding Chronicler's search for Kvothe: I don't think there's any big mystery here. He and Skarpi were on the road to visit the Earl in Treya when they heard a rumor (passed along by Bast) that Kvothe was in Newarre. Chronicler sent Skarpi on ahead and decided to go to Newarre to check for himself.

I don't really see how the first real lover who called him Dulator could be anyone other than Denna. She's the only girl he's expressed any romantic feelings towards in the Chronicle, hence the first *real* lover part.

The part about stealing princesses back from sleeping barrow kings is probably an exaggerated story version of the time he rescued Krin and Ellie from the fake Edema Ruh troupe."

Pretty easy to think of it as Chronicler and Skarpi having an appointment with the Earl and Skarpi suggesting he stop on the way to look for Kvothe which he considers a foolish side quest as he didn’t expect to find him. I never read any further into it than that."

I do not see the problem with Dulator being one of the names Felurian gave to Kvothe. Not only this could have while his WMF visit and have been omitted by Kote during his story, it is also likely that Kvothe visited Felurian again during DoS (he yet has to meet Bast somewhere and to fulfill the oath to come back to Felurian). It is not inconceivable to assume that she called him Dulator during this second encounter."

I like the interpretation, but the fake Ruh definitely weren't exactly sleeping.

Literal/metaphorical interpretations aside, I can't imagine Kvothe calling ""kings"" those bastards, not even as mockery. *The Road to Levinshir* is officially the oldest KKC chapter in existence (although rewritten), any eventual allusions to it were most likely thought a lot.

With this said I'll keep my eyes open during WMF and search if something ""king""like is concerned during the episode.

Disagree with this one but I'm not sure I can explain myself properly, hoping to be somewhat clear:
“first real lover” implies the existence of other real lovers. If Denna's the one, that line would mean that there are other girls who had an equally impressive impact over Kvothe. I don't think it's possible.

>Favourite Track?

Too hard to pick one so I'll say my top songs in some order are New World Water, Climb, Mathematics, and May-December

> Favorite Lyrics

The entire album

>Favorite beat

New World Water probably but also May-December is a perfect instrumental song and an amazing ending

> Where does it stand against Mos’ other albums?

I think it's about even with Black Star, maybe slightly better overall but I think Black Star probably has higher highs. The only other Mos Def solo album I've heard is The Ecstatic which is great but I definitely like Black on Both Sides more.

>How relevant is this album to the modern world?

I think New World Water in particular seems relevant given how fucked the water systems are in a lot of cities in America, especially the Flint Water Crisis. Political stuff can age poorly but this album has a very broad message that will probably always be timeless. Mos Def is also very ahead of the times as one of the earlier rappers to start singing. He's also a significantly better singer than most rappers that try to sing so that's nice."
996,2020-04-21 18:20:51,g5gj7y,"A strong statement of an album. Mos touched on a lot, as explained in your great writeup OP. A colossal album that utilizes every minute. A lot of albums this long feel long. This never does. The album varies from topic to topic, sound to sound, yet still sounds cohesive. This works because Mos might be the most versatile MC in Hip Hop history. His flow bends from slow to rapid fire, lyrics transforming from hard braggadocio to sweet loving words to preacher man conscious. And hell, he can even sing. He and this album are a complete package that he was never quite able to match again. 

My favorite track is of course Mathematics. Premo is a fave producer and he saved one of his best for Mos to breakdown such a barrage of conscious topics with a fierce technical demonstration. So of course my favorite lyrics and beat is here as well. And this is by far Mos' best solo album, no disrespect to The Ecstatic, which is a great album. But it is not as groundbreaking and complete as this album. And of course, many of the issues talked about on this album are still relevant today, adding to the timelessness of the album. 

I don't know about last album of the golden age. Six months later, a great companion album to this album, Like Water For Chocolate, by Mos' collaborator Common was released. As for what his album means to Hip Hop, I think it is the defining work of one of its great versatile artists. A reflection of post Pac & Biggie Hip Hop that was still trying to write its next chapter while making sense of it all. This album was the defining album of Rawkus and the late 90s/early 2000s conscious underground movement, an underground release that broke through to the mainstream. And its still a testament of how to be original, true to yourself, while also speaking of greater social issues, while remaining firmly true to your roots."
997,2020-04-21 17:55:47,g5gj7y,"I work in Water, so NWW speaks to me. The counting verse and ""straw"" punchline on Mathematics blew my mind in 1998, (and reminds me of Common's plot-twist punchlines on I used to love H.E.R. & Stolen Moments Pt. 2). Ms. Fat Booty still slaps. This album is still relevant, topically and musically."
998,2020-04-21 19:19:42,g5gj7y,"I remember I first heard about this album when I was 14 and traveled to Peru on a Spanish immersion trip, my one of the trip leaders was a huge hip hop head and was a big part of me getting into hip hop.

I don't remember the context but he mentioned the lyric ""You know the motto/Stay fluid even in staccato"" from ""Hip Hop"" and I've always loved that track. That lyric specifically really encapsulates why I love hip hop, it's quality wordplay, it flows great, it sounds great, it gets stuck in your head. It's got a bombastic sound and it's full of quotables.

For a while, this was my favorite album. I haven't listened to it in full in a while though.

What I gravitate to at the moment is ""Fear Not of Men"", the Fela sample is perfect. The spoken intro is so fresh w the hip hop part and the ""Tryin' to be God"" part.

The chorus is so catchy and rthymic in a way that complements the Fela really well:

>All over the world hearts pound with the rhythm  
Fear not of men because men must die  
Mind over matter and soul before flesh  
Angels hold a pen, keep a record in time  
Which is passing and running like a caravan trader  
The world is overrun with the wealthy and the wicked  
But God is sufficient in disposing of affairs  
Gunmen and stockholders try to merit my fear  
But God is sufficient over plans they prepared  
Mos Def in the flesh, where you at, right here  
On this place called Earth, holding down my square  

It also captures that the world at the time of 1999 very well. The stuff about governments w the PATRIOT Act right around the corner for example.

Another standout is ""Speed Law,"" Mos's flow and delivery is so great. I especially dig the way he says ""Relax"", super catchy."
999,2020-04-21 18:11:16,g5gj7y,"I love this album. Basically been listening to this and Black Star for about a year straight now. Never gets boring and it's super dense.

This is tough because all the tracks are strong. Mathematics is a perfect hip hop track. But aside from that, I find myself loving Hip Hop, Speed Law, Got, and New World Water.

>Favorite Lyrics?

Once again, very difficult to pick. Whole album is very lyrical and take on their own issue.
I'll just share two of my favorite moments that come from Speed Law and New World Water, respectively. 

Speed Law, Verse 2

""Tell the feds, tell your girl, tell your mother


Conference call your wack crew and tell each other


That they just ain't holding me""

New World Water, Verse 2

""The type of cats who pollute the whole shore line

Have it purified, sell it for a dollar twenty-five""


>Favorite Beat 



Mathematics

>Where does it stand against Mos’ other albums?

I have only listened to The Ecstatic and Black Star along with this. BOBS > BS > Ecstatic

>Relevance

I think the issues and concepts shared on this are meaningful and hold up in modern times. Some relevant highlights would be: Hip Hop, Got, New World Water, Mathematics. All of them talk about their issues in a way that still hold up today.

>What does this album mean to the genre of hip hop?

I think this is a perfect album front to back. It's a staple in hip hop and for good reason. The production, lyrics, flows, delivery just outshine most other projects. This is definitely a must listen for anyone who loves hip hop."
1000,2020-04-21 15:39:21,g5gj7y,"Great write-up, imo at the top of best hip hop albums of all time.

> Favorite track

A bit cliche, but probably Mathematics. It's just a perfect song. And even if the numbers have changed over the years, the message still resonates true.

> Favorite lyrics/beats

Honestly couldn't pick a favorite. Again, Mathematics may take the cake for beat, but idk as they're all unique. I love New World Water too.

As for lyrics, literally everything on here haha. Every song has some type of powerful bar.

> Where does it stand

As I said before, this is his best and imo the best of hip hop. I'd say his ranking goes BOBS > Definition ≥ Ecstatic > New Danger ≥ True Magic. I actually really enjoy True Magic despite it being his most negatively received. 

> Relevance

What makes this still such a great and powerful album is how, two decades later, everything talked about is still relevant to a degree. Now that shows how sad the world can be, that 20 years on problems still haven't changed. However, some of these problems have made progress and overall the optimism is contagious.

As I mentioned before, the numbers have changed a bit but the message remains the same, so it'll stay a powerful and quintessential album as long as these problems still remain.

I think it will always have such relevancy because of ""the seven deadly thrills"" (as said in Mathematics). The 7 Deadly Sins will be apparent in the world no matter what, and this whole album is pretty much distinctively breaking down these sins in the world, with bouts of optimism. Every song isn't negative or chastising, but the ones that are tend to deal with these sins  So while, New World Water may not be as relevant as it was in 1999, (although still very relevant with recent water crisis') the greed sentiment of the song, especially by corporations, is every bit still relevant.

But even ones like Speed Law and Got are now relevant again with what seems like more and more rappers getting murdered. There's a certain way Mos writes braggadocios bars that you can find through this album that make them more than just that, they stay relevant to the whole culture of rap. They're vague enough to encapsulate most people, but lyrical enough to stand out and stand the test of time"

This album is a foundation piece for modern conscious lyrical hip-hop. Without Mos Def making a project this exceedingly dope with this level of depth and length it further validated hip-hop as a genre

 The concert I went to, titled ""Mos Def Performs Black on Both Sides in Entirety"", was a big disappointment though. I was expecting a top to bottom performance of the project, in order, with possible guests given this was in a big city. I understand about the guests not being available or whatever, but I was hoping he would at least play the album in order.  However, it was just a normal Mos Def concert of his biggest hits, which included many of the songs on the album, but not all of them. He also talked a little too much between tracks, and showed up on stage after making us watch what felt like 45 minutes of footage about trains in a New York yard. 
 
Still love the album, and I'm glad I got to see him perform since he doesn't do it often. Just thought I'd share since the concert experience will probably always be associated with *Black on Both Sides* for me."

1011,2020-04-21 22:44:32,g5gj7y,Phenomenal writeup! I learned a lot about the album through this!
1012,2020-04-22 02:48:30,g5gj7y,Minor thing but am I the only one who had never seen the back cover?
1013,2020-04-22 06:09:25,g5gj7y,You know an album is good when everyone has a different favorite track or beat
1014,2020-04-22 22:08:40,g5gj7y,Fear Not of Man is not only my favorite beat/ favorite song on this album but is my self- proclaimed favorite song of all time. That Fela Kuti sample resonates with my soul and I smile every time I hear it. The song has gotten me through countless hardships and this album will always mean so much to me.
1015,2020-04-23 02:11:33,g5gj7y,my favorite hip hop album of all time. dude was soooo ahead of his time it’s not even funny.
1016,2020-04-21 16:07:26,g5gj7y,"> The only other Mos Def solo album I've heard is The Ecstatic which is great but I definitely like Black on Both Sides more.

I'd recommend The New Danger, especially if the Yeezus / XXX from Kendrick sound is in your alley. This is kind of a before-its-time Yeezus / Speedin Bullet sounding project (better than the latter that's for sure), the rock elements were very surprising for a '04 tape and even if this album got some pretty mediocre reviews overall, I feel like that it was a bit too ahead of its time and if it's not a masterpiece at all it's an intriguing experience."
1017,2020-04-21 20:55:43,g5gj7y,">What I gravitate to at the moment is ""Fear Not of Men"", the Fela sample is perfect. The spoken intro is so fresh w the hip hop part and the ""Tryin' to be God"" part.

...I should have read your post before I made my own. Totally agree."
1018,2020-04-21 18:25:09,g5dpne,"I am a 21 year old college student and have lived with a few different roommates and I’ve learned that just because they’re older than you doesn’t mean they’ll be more mature. The 25 year old that I live with now is just ridiculous. I lived with someone my age once and she was insane and not paying rent. I called her mom hoping for some outside reasonable adult perspective. Turns out the 20 year old immature nut job was raised by the 50 year old immature nut job mother. 
I’ve decided that 9/10 roommates don’t work. Too many people are gross and immature. Not worth the gamble"
1019,2020-04-21 19:19:58,g5dpne,"Wow I thought these were maybe younger adults who were just starting out on their own. Not that it makes the behaviors ok, but it would make sense at least. The fact that they are practically middle aged adults and act this way is unfortunately probably a sign they're set in their ways and don't care. I guess since you seem to have the support of your other housemates I'd suggest coming to them as a group and confronting them together. Maybe it they here it from more than one of you they'll get a hint. Probably doubtful though. Sorry and good luck"
1020,2020-04-26 03:51:42,g5dpne,"Start throwing their wet laundry on the ground when its done and don't give a shit about it.  You want to cook something and their in the kitchen squatting, tell them to get the fuck out and cook your food.  Stop being so nice at this point, you've tried that route and nothings come of it.  It's time to start fighting fire with fire. 

Honestly the one part of this that really struck a nerve with me was the issue with your plants haha.  I love gardening but one thing everyone knows is DON'T MESS WITH MY PLANTS.  Thats where my self control would have abruptly ended with these two and mistakes would have been made (I know, weird thing to be my trigger with all the other stuff you mentioned but I've accepted this aspect of my personality long ago haha).  

You've shown crazy amounts of patience through this and you shouldn't be expected to continue doing so.  Its time to get all the other roommates involved as well and tell these two garbage people to cut the shit or get the hell out."
1021,2020-04-27 20:34:20,g5dpne,"Just an update, today reached breaking point when I caught one of the couple messing around with my property.. when I confronted them about it I was given a barrage of abuse them calling me a dirty gypsy for trying to steal this property... When I told them in somewhat disbelief that it is mine and I have the receipt to prove it if necessary they continued to say I was lying and stealing....

I made a complaint to the landlord agency and they said they would have a word with them..  I'm viewing a new room completely separate from all that is associated with this property tomorrow afternoon."
1022,2020-09-26 00:28:12,g5dpne,"Without the final say in the matter, and legally being on the same level as those schmucks, I would say that being aggressive is a really good way to an all out war. 
That couple sounds like they are stupid, obnoxious and unaware of how toxic they are, by showing how annoyed they make you feel, they will feel totally justified by upping the ante in retaliation. Not a great way to de escalate the situation. 

Some people will never understand how horrible they are to live with, and though it would be tempting to destroy everything to do with them, burn their lives and maybe leave them stranded in the woods with no phones or music players or lighters... it's technically you who would be creating more conflict, and people like that will make damn sure that it looks like you who's starting the fight.

The only way is clear, open, non aggressive confrontation, spelling out in no uncertain terms what is and isn't acceptable behaviour, and open communication with the agency and other housemates. If everyone else really hates them, and they alone keep breaching the contract, then they can be evicted. it's possible but unfortunately it is just easier to move away from that hot mess."

1039,2020-04-21 11:12:24,g5a8ru,"1. Can't be Melo because the theory came about before Melo was a thing.

2. It's not about being a ball-stopper, or any specific element of play... It's just about winning. The whole premise is that it is inexplicable why a team would win after losing its seemingly 'best' player. Ewing is the face of it because it happened to the Knicks, not because of anything he specifically did or didn't do."
1040,2020-04-21 11:26:03,g5a8ru,"My understanding of the Ewing Theory is a little different. It wasn't because he was a ball stopper or based on his later play. It came around earlier than that.

The theory has two parts:

 

1. A team *inexplicably* plays better when their star player is injured or on the bench.
2. A team reaches new heights immediately following the departure of a star player.

So my understanding of it is that the team actually doesn't try as hard when they know they have a superstar to bail them out. And if that team doesn't have the leader to challenge them to match that superstars effort, then they fail to get over the hump. Once the superstar is removed, they realise that they have to pick up the slack.

There are multiple articles that ask if it is fair to call it the Ewing Theory, and I'm with you, there are better players that it could be named after. But it isn't because of his later play, it came around long before that."
1041,2020-04-21 13:43:29,g5a8ru,"Bill Simmons just doesn't like the Knicks and that's alright. He's popular and we're an easy target so it doesn't really matter if it makes sense. The Celtics are obviously a much more accomplished franchise then the Knicks, but Bill Simmons gets really upset about those brief (very brief) periods in time where we were actually better. That's why he's always making up shit about Ewing and Melo. For example, when did Melo do this: 

https://mobile.twitter.com/billsimmons/status/1213866710937194496?lang=en


??"
1042,2020-04-21 17:42:24,g5a8ru,"Kyrie had a similar affect on boston. While they played well and won with him, i would say they played better as a team without him. With that being said i think they are better off without him and getting kemba definitely softened the blow"
1043,2020-04-21 20:51:25,g5a8ru,"So I think the ""Ewing theory"" is actually a proxy for something else:

That high-volume, moderate-efficiency scorers do much less to help your team win than the conventional wisdom, or the level of stardom accorded to that kind of player, suggests. 

Unless you do other things well, being someone who scores a lot at moderate efficiency gets you paid, gets you headlines, but *doesn't actually contribute very much to winning*. 

In Ewing's case, once his knees started to go, (in the '91 season) not only did his efficiency drop but his rim protection really started to drop, too. By the mid-90s, he still had the reputation of a superstar, but he wasn't a superstar in terms of production. 

A non-superstar who everybody THINKS is a superstar is one of the hardest players to work with. They demand minutes, and as a coach you get yelled at for not feeding them the ball. The offense almost always has to revolve around them regardless of whether or not that's still appropriate. 

So when suddenly they leave the team, you're able to redistribute shots more optimally - you no longer have to feed the aging star, and you can make stylistic choices that cater to what your player's strengths *actually* are. 

So in this way, calling it the ""Ewing Theory"" is entirely appropriate. Not because Ewing was flawed, in his prime - but because Ewing's prime ended in 1990, and he was considered a star, and treated like one, probably up until 1997. 

There's no way the, say, 1989 Knick steam would have been better without Ewing. No amount of teammates stepping up and being more motivated was going to make up for the loss of *that* guy. But that guy wasn't on the floor in 1994, even though everybody acted like he was. 

Because the *team* improved from 90-93 (and made the finals in 94) people didn't see that Ewing was declining. Ewing was the leading scorer or a finals team, he has to be the reason they won, right?

Except no. They were a team that won with their defense. Their offense was average - or worse (22nd in ORTG in 93 - out of 27 teams). But if fans and the media under appreciate defense today - and they absolutely do - back then it was far worse, because there were so many fewer voices talking about sports.  

I think you'll find that almost every memorable ""Ewing theory"" player is a high-volume, moderate-efficiency scorer who doesn't do a whole lot else well. Often they're past their prime when the ""Ewing theory"" applies - not so far past it that it's obvious in the counting stats, but it's clear if you watch them or pay attention to more nuanced details. (For example, Ewing himself started relying on his mid-range jumper rather than getting to the rim, and stopped contesting a lot of shots)."
1044,2020-04-22 15:57:38,g5a8ru,"Yea, Patrick Ewing is a bad example of Ewing Theory. The team's better play wasn't inexplicable. Ewing's knees were shot. He was already way on the downslope of his career. And he was taking lots of minutes from Marcus Camby who was a much better player in 1999."
1045,2020-04-21 14:11:31,g5a8ru,That is clearly pulling a Vince (Carter)
1046,2020-04-21 14:31:27,g5a8ru,What I remember about that period is Amare’s contract really screwed up the Knicks. Melo wasn’t playing with the best team after JR got traded and probably extended some injuries.
1047,2020-04-21 14:50:00,g5a8ru,"Melo negotiated a No Trade Clause with the Knicks. He left a little money on the table to do so. He was adamant he really really wanted to stay with the Knicks. Phil kept on going to the media and being like, ""God damn we want to trade Melo so bad!"" And eventually Melo was like ""Fuck it, if you insist on trading me, then at least trade me to a contender."" And he waived his NTC to move from NYC to OKC in what ended up being a great trade for the Knicks. I feel like thats the complete opposite of demanding a trade. Its demanding to stay until you eventually get sick of being humiliated publicly. It is literally the reason Porzingis skipped his first exit interview. 

&#x200B;

Amare's contract hurt but we could have amnesty'd him. Just a million dumb decisions all around like usual (e.g. Bargnani)"
1048,2020-04-21 15:01:21,g5a8ru,Ah gotcha it pains me to see the Knicks in such disarray after watching them take on the Bulls & rest of NBA in the 90s. The Isiah Thomas years made me turn away from the Knicks completely and haven’t followed them seriously since. Knowing the type of player Amare was in Phoenix being a Suns fan I had serious questions about his longevity after two micro fracture knee surgeries earlier in his career. Really sucked to see him dominate for half of the first year and then have injuries since. That rings a giant bell of Phil just mishandling the situation and causing Melo & Porzingis demand to leave a toxic environment. Any case it seems like for the first time the future seems to be bright for the Knicks! Solid foundational pieces in Barrett and others. If they hit the draft lottery and wait for a star FA to sign you’ll be back in the race.
1049,2020-04-21 15:48:19,g5a8ru,"Thanks! Yeah as a Knicks fan you learn not to get toooo hopeful. But Leon Rose seems like a smart guy and honestly the next few years will be difficult but simple at the same time. It's like taking over a baseball team that still hasnt embraced the shift. Just modernize the team. It's a lot easier said than done. But RJ and Mitch are already two young guys who are good and could be great for modern basketball; we have a ton of draft picks, and if there's one thing Dolan can get credit for it's that he is willing to go over the cap for a winner. I'm looking forward to whenever basketball starts up again."

1053,2020-04-22 05:37:41,g59gs8,I think you make a fantastic point about picking BPA for OL. Never thought about that honestly.

hey why don't you strap on a jet pack and relax bud."
1055,2020-04-21 06:25:36,g59gs8,"I think this is a decent breakdown. But I think you're missing a couple key points. We're in a win now mode and can't really afford busts. 

Yes we addressed OT and ILB in free agency. But they're both going to be a bit hit or miss. If they play as well as they should we've got two steals. But even then Wagner is still a band-aid. And if Kirksey doesn't pan out or gets injured we literally don't have an inside linebacker. If he does pan out which I think he will we could still use another. Pettine really likes to run two inside linebackers, and it's extra help against the run. Also we were garbage at covering tight ends last year, so someone who can cover from ILB would be massive. If we weren't being dismantled by a running back we were getting burned by a tight end. These are both heavy needs we need to address in the first 3 rounds. 

I'd put ILB as our top need just because that draft class is a bit iffy and WR is super deep so I'd put that second. I think if Queen and Murray are both gone by 30 we'll probably trade back for an extra pick which is incredibly valuable in this draft for us. Zack Baun could still be a great pickup at 30 or even better early 2nd round. He can cover, he's a fantastic tackler, great sideline to sideline speed to interrupt plays and chase players down and we can blitz him. He's a threat everywhere.

We don't really need safety. We have Amos and Savage which is a fantastic duo. And we have Raven Green back from injury. He was looking really good before he got injured and he can shift to LB if need be. What we do need is CB. Jaire is a stud, Chandon Sullivan had a breakout year he was phenomenal, Kevin King is good when he's healthy but may be gone next year and Josh Jackson is a huge question mark. I think it's safe to say Tramon isn't coming back and he was just  a band-aid at that position. CB could be a great value add with an additional pick gained if we trade back, or there's some really nice looking CBs at later round picks. 

WR totally agree massive need. Most likely a 2nd round pick but wouldn't be surprised at first. I could easily see us picking up two more WRs in the 4th and 5th rounds. We did get Funchess which is fantastic, now one or two more difference makers in the draft and we're set. Rodgers is still killing it and can still sling the ball like nobody else, he just has to trust his receivers. We went from being stacked at WR for years to pretty much just davante and it shows (also coincides with the alleged ""Rodgers is dropping off and getting old""). TE I'd like to see a late round pick see what we can get. But definitely not a big need Jace is our future he's gonna be good.

IDL huge need. Our run defense hurts. If we get a good ILB I can see this priority dropping a bit. Still would like to see it addressed in the first 4 rounds. Kenny Clark needs some help let's get him some. We're really wasting his career here with a subpar line playing next to him. If we can draft some help good luck blocking Clark and the Smith bros. I think Gary will step up big time this year as well. I think they were just easing him in last year and focusing more on developing him. Would not be surprised to see him have a breakout year. If he does our pass rush will easily be top 3."
1056,2020-04-21 13:02:45,g59gs8,"Lowry is garbage?  This is an awful take.  You cant have studs at every single position on the field.  Risking drafting a DL with a later pick in each round is a terrible strategy because you think Lowry is garbage.  He holds up well against the run and with 2 down DL in a 3-4 the goal is to stop the run.  Go draft a run stopper like Ross Blacklock and watch how he plays 20% of snaps and wont impact a game ever cause hes 1 dimensional. Watch all of his games and hes not a difference maker.  I'd rather have Lowry.

You're not even giving KeKe a chance after his rookie season.  Our DL in our scheme are not meant to be do it all guys. Our scheme clearly doesnt value stopping the run and instead focuses on the pass.  The strategy got them to the NFC Championship, you can't argue against it.

Blake Martinez and Mike Daniel's correlation makes no sense so I'll assume you arent a coach or scout.  Martinez had limitations but his production never slipped.  He was never a cover guy an we knew this coming out of that draft.  He was smart and cleaned up runs.  Pettine said its quicker to get to Florida by plane than by car.  So that's why he didnt value an ILB. 

The Packers need to be the team that controls the clock and puts up points, so drafting OL, WR is in their best interest.  This is exactly how their defensive strategy will work and how they can beat the 49ers.   Remember we drafted Justin Harrell, Datone Jones, a DL from Michigan State, Etc.  DL is very risky if not drafting one in the top 15.  They arent as impactful as other players can be to balance the field of play. 

That rushing game in the NFC Championsip was a fluke and clearly Pettine was outplayed.  It threw off everything and I dont see that happening again.  I'm sure the Packers arent sweating it."
1057,2020-04-21 18:43:45,g59gs8,"I just don’t see how WR is a significantly greater need than TE. We are an offense that runs a ton of 2 TE sets and may even need to use our TEs as H-backs a lot, since we don’t currently have a FB. 

At WR we have a bonafide #1, we have a new signee who when healthy is a capable #2 and we have 3 young guys that have flashed at some point. 

At TE we have a 36 y/o blocker who is about replacement level at this point, a 3rd rounder with 15 career yards, and a UDFA who can’t block and has 177 career yards. 

I think everyone is giving this massive benefit of the doubt to Sternberger simply because we haven’t seen enough of him to temper expectations yet. Meanwhile they are entirely writing off MVS because of some struggles after he got injured. 

If we were still a team that relied heavily on 3 WR and even 4 WR sets, I’d get it. That’s not who we are anymore. We want to utilize the TE position heavily and we have very little there. I put them on the same level of need, with the caveat that the WR class is about a million times better in this draft."
1058,2020-04-21 17:04:20,g59gs8,"It worked out for Rodgers, why can't it work for me? 

/s"
1059,2020-04-21 17:03:35,g59gs8,I agree for the most part. I think we just don't really have the option of addressing ILB earlier than round 3 unless there is value. Troy Dye and ADG are options. We still have too many holes.
1060,2020-04-21 16:59:22,g59gs8,"If you think Blacklock is a run stuffer and only plays 20% of plays and Lowry ""holds up well against the run"", I suggest you watch more film. He would be a significant upgrade over Lowry. It isn't close. I think you are underestimating Blacklock here. Keke is a 5th round guy who could do the exact same job as Lowry. These are your usual 4th/5th round talents, mediocre starters. Not every 4th round guy is Bakhtiari. If the line stopped the run (which it was better at with Daniels), then Martinez's lack of big plays and awful sideline to sideline play wasn't as obvious because the packers didn't stop the run. The loss to SF wasn't a fluke, we were simply dominated in the trenches on both sides of the ball. Period."
1061,2020-04-21 19:31:48,g59gs8,"This TE class is very weak. Decent depth but the top guys are bad. Sternberger would've been the #1 TE in this class. We got our guy. He basically redshirted last season and would've cost us a second or even a first this year. Packers got a great value. Last year was one of the most stacked TE classes in years, and we got the 4th best one in the class. Grossi has an interview with Sternberger who says he would be TE1 this year easily, according to his coach. I agree with him. This WR class is so, so much better that we need to get one. I agree Rodgers needs more pass catchers in general, not just WR. But the way this draft is, WR is definitely the answer. Pittman Jr., who will definitely be available for us if we want him, would immediately be the second best WR on the roster."
1062,2020-04-21 19:25:25,g59gs8,"I think we don't see it as a need going into the draft since TEs, regardless of how talented they truly end up being, very rarely have impact seasons in their first pro season.  So basically, any TE we take is going to be a guy we look to develop.  Even if we draft a guy like Kmet, we're looking at Sternberger being the focal point of our TE group."
1063,2020-04-21 18:47:06,g59gs8,"We do though. You never know how the draft is going to fall. One of Queen, Murray, or baun should be around at 30. If they aren’t then yeah we can go and get one in round 3 with someone like dye I really like him. We have a lot of holes to fill but our lack of a run defense and inability to cover tight ends I think makes inside linebacker our biggest most glaring hole. And while I think trading back out of the first is the best option I wouldn’t be surprised if we traded up a little for Queen or Murray depending on who slides the farthest. When we could stop the run last year we could compete. Whether it was actually stopping the run or getting a bit enough lead that our opponent couldn’t afford to run a lot because the clock wasn’t on their side. Hell there were games like against the 49ers where we couldn’t even use our elite pass rush. It was just a ton of wasted money on the field. And we don’t have as many holes as you think. General run defense massive hole. Need IDL and ILB badly. WR hole. Got funchess need to draft someone else hopefully Lazard and EQ can step up as well. RT has a bandaid so drafting there would be great. Drafting CB would be nice. Every where else were locked and loaded."
1064,2020-04-21 17:04:17,g59gs8,I only watched full game film of Blacklock and wasnt impressed.  Also Blacklock wont be much of an upgrade nor will he save the run defense like you're suggesting.
1065,2020-04-21 19:51:13,g59gs8,"I think there’s some truth to that, but that only makes TE a bigger need. That means we need to draft a guy *now* to replace Marcedes, or spend in FA next year when we don’t have much money at all. I think the lack of good TEs in this class means we may not grab one, but the *need* is there and it’s significant."
1066,2020-04-21 19:27:45,g59gs8,"Yup. You hit the nail on the head. I don't think we have a TON of holes, but we really need to nail this draft, or we're going to have to wait until next year's draft. You're right. We are in WIN NOW mode. We don't have time to waste getting depth, we need playmakers at WR/IDL/LB, and now! RT can wait until next year unless there is value. We have about a 3-4 year window to get Rodgers another ring. They need to take advantage of it."
1067,2020-04-21 17:20:53,g59gs8,"Are you not a fan of Blacklock? I mean, there's 10 other guys that are all good. Take your pick. Gallimore, Davidson, Madubuike, Davis, etc. I'm just giving an example."
1068,2020-04-21 17:48:12,g59gs8,Yes I would take one of them later in the draft

1070,2020-04-21 21:03:25,g59az2,Carrie's three friends are archetypes.
1071,2020-04-23 07:52:54,g59az2,"They needed someone ""slutty"" to place all these characters into moral quandaries and offer a barometer for their own encounters. The irony is, personalities aside, they all sleep with A LOT of men."
1072,2020-04-21 13:02:00,g59az2,"I actually view each of the characters' personalities and views on relationships as phases in maturity (not necessarily for the better).

&#x200B;

1) Charlotte is the idealism of youth and inexperience.  She is fully bought in on the fairy tale

2) Carrie has a few lingering moments of the childish idealism while moving into the next phase of relationship understanding, self-absorbtion and ego as a motivator.  The belief that anyone would be lucky enough to have her, and that she doesn't need to change to make it work - they do.

3) Miranda moves into the next phase of relationship belief, ""there are no good men left"" and through trial and tribulation, she's finds strength and stability in her professional identity and puts less effort into her romantic identity.  She simply doesn't want to squander her time and attention on something not fruitful.

4) Samantha is the last phase of relationship belief (from a single person's perspective), that all relationships are sadly transactional, and to protect oneself from pain and discomfort, keep things to the lowest common denominator and treat men (or women) as a hobby.  She's clearly been so hurt and damaged moved through the previous phases that she isn't interested in letting anyone close to her, except to serve her appetite for a good ""workout"".  elf-protective and selfish, she has reconciled that her life may really be spent alone and thus, returns to the self-absorption/ego moment in the Carrie phase but throws it on a 10.  

&#x200B;

Re-watching this series during quarantine has been a super interesting exercise for me.  I was roughly 26 when it first aired and now Im roughly Big's age. Upon first airing I was all about Carrie - thinking all men were doing her dirty and she deserved better.  Now at 45, I am fully sympathetic with Big and how overly needy, self absorbed, and ego driven Carrie is and after his frequent attempts in telling her (in different ways) that he was not interested in the type of commitment that she so ideated, he finally finds someone easier to be with (Natasha).  We all know how it ends - you cant deny love and chemistry - but Big put up with a lot of Carrie's nonsense - frankly more than I would have."
1073,2020-04-21 10:30:04,g59az2,I used to love Samantha but I realized she cannot carry a conversation and none of her scenes show her doing anything non sexual. She’s obnoxious and she does come across as more of an addict than a woman who unabashedly enjoys sex.
1074,2020-04-21 14:20:51,g59az2,"Are we getting these threads every day now instead of ""Carrie is awful""."
1075,2020-04-26 20:36:40,g59az2,"Thank you! I made a post about this and a lof of people didn't agree. I can't really understand why we can't face that some things have not aged well.

I remember when I was young I thought she was so cool because she was presented as empowered. In reality she needed approval from men. She even said charlote should let her boyfriend pee on her because uf ou really like the guy, you should. That message (obbviously not just from the show) really messed me up because I though I had to force myself to do thing I didn't want. I thouagh that's how you become free and liberstwd or whatever. It's not. It causes a lof of problems that I spent years working through."
1076,2020-04-21 11:11:22,g59az2,"Points 5-Sam Jones, the student, sexually assaults and stalks her! She had every right to be dismissive of him. He turns up at her apartment, and kisses her and forces her on the bed, when she's given zero indication that she likes him. 

Point 7- Agree 100%. She was racist. Also, reverse racism does not exist (for those who want to claim that the sister was 'racist'). The 'big black ass' comment was horrific. As was the 'I don't see colour' comment.

What you have to remember is, that the girls are meant to be archetypes. So not all of their behaviour is supposed to be taken literally."

1078,2020-04-21 18:47:56,g59az2,"I appreciate this comment and this perspective, thank you for adding it! But I still disagree, I don't think Samantha represents the ""last phase"" more than they all represent different philosophies on love/marriage, with Charlotte being the most conservative, Carrie being the eternal Scarlett O'Hara (the parallels are endless and I think its clear this is what the writers were going for with her character), Miranda being the cynic, and Samantha being the spinster (but instead of making her stereotypically ashamed of it, they make her proud).  


I don't think Samantha represents the last phase of relationship belief from a single person's perspective because its too static and objective to put this on her and doesn't correlate with her desperation to be attached to another man or her jealousy over the men she dates. The characteristics she has outside the bedroom are still abhorrent and obnoxious and if they were on any friend of anyone's they would throw them in the trash. I think her being hurt and damaged to the point where she uses men and gets mad at her girlfriends for being open to men or flat out abandons them comes across more of a Mrs. Havisham brand petulance and less or a ""take no shit"" type of woman."
1079,2020-04-25 03:04:03,g59az2,"Point 7 - so it’s ok that she told her to get her little white pussy away from her bro, but big black ass is a problem? Reverse racism is such an idiotic term. If you comment on anyone’s race in a negative way it’s racism, always, across the damn board."
1080,2020-05-27 03:04:04,g59az2,"The sister was definitely racist, she had a problem with her brother not dating a black girl. And her comment was absolutely uncalled for, same thing with Sam’s comment. When she said “I don’t see color” she didn’t mean it as actually not seeing race but as seeing everyone the same way. The sister started the race comments, but it’s only wrong when Sam makes them out of defense?"
1081,2020-04-21 06:42:03,g59az2,"I’m not going to touch numbers 4-7, but as for 1-3, those were really revolutionary to have on TV for a female character at the time. Samantha’s character was an incredibly big deal to have on TV."
1082,2020-04-21 09:01:39,g59az2,"Countering 4. First - reverse racism isn’t real??? And furthermore Samantha says other racist stuff on the show “this isn’t chillin’ at Snoop Doggs’ crib”????? Also even if reverse racism was a thing is she 11 years old? Mommy, he hit me first so I get to be a racist ???? Jfc she’s 45 years old. Charlotte understands how an eye for an eye make the world blind. This isn’t an excuse it’s a shitty person 


7. Um not fulfilling someone’s emotional needs is not the same as not fulfilling someone’s sexual needs. This philosophy is demonstrated on the show: The politician isn’t sexually fulfilled by Carrie, he leaves her, HES portrayed as the asshole. When Charlotte won’t perform oral she’s considered ridiculous until they break it down: it shouldn’t be the only thing of importance or even the breaking point in a relationship. Guy breaks up w her, she leaves, he’s portrayed as a creep who sexually abuses his dog because he’s so desperate for oral that if he doesn’t get it he’ll commit beastiality. This is basic common sense - not willing to give someone sex (and it’s not even like she’s refusing everything, she’s sexual, she just isn’t enabling what is clearly an addiction) isn’t the same as not communicating. You can have a happy relationship without a blowjob you cannot have one without communication 
I’m not debating that further because if you honestly open that door you’re opening a door that leads to sexual and emotional abuse. 


6. Why does that matter at all???????????? She knows these men are married and sleeps with them anyways. This isn’t empowerment this is hurting another woman because she can’t sleep with someone single? Seriously? 


5. They could have developed story lines for her earlier but they couldn’t because her character sucked. Charlotte and Miranda got massive plot lines early on. There’s nothing with weight you can do with a character who’s only trait is their sex addiction 


3. This isn’t a debate in relative morality. I understand she doesn’t like kids. Charlotte is jealous and upset that she can’t have kids and she doesn’t take it out on her. Carrie doesn’t like kids but sucks it up anyway. This isn’t how you treat a friend. Samantha acts like a baby about her friends child because it’s not what she likes? How selfish is she? She took care of the kid out of pity and guilt - which she should rightfully feel and after she realized her behaviour was what makes a bad friend. Same w Charlotte and the underwear. 


She literally did take shit from others she got back with Richard because she liked him and wanted him and only after it physically caused her discomfort did she leave 


She got back together with Dominic as a means of playing him - thus giving him what he wants - and she immediately got attached and then he played her. This is taking shit from someone else
Her being a bad friend isn’t “taking shit” none of her friends try to walk all over her, they’re dealing with their own problems, she disagrees with it and instead of being a good friend like they are to her and realizing she has a different value system but loves them regardless, she dumps them or insults them


You can’t in one sentence say “she has a different value system” and in the next “i don’t see charlottes problem with her sleeping with her brother.” She was uncomfortable with it, period. You don’t get to decide the appropriate for another person to be hurt so that you can do what you want to do without carrying responsibility or guilt. Also tonnes of people would have ended friendships over this, tonnes of people would have been made uncomfortable with this. I don’t really care about what you think about it it’s an objective discussion about her performance as a friend and a character and this is a dog shit thing to do. 


Charlotte wasn’t just upset about everything she forgave Carrie when she cheated on Aidan, she forgave Samantha when she had that drink and slept with her brother, she gets over her resentments quickly and deals with situations extremely well (confronting bunny, confronting trey, saying what she’s sexually comfortable and uncomfortable with, confronting big in the first movie, and she does all this without throwing a temper tantrum !!!! Because she’s an adult !!!!)


1. as I said she gets attached to men insanely easily (Richard, Smith, Dominic, James, she gets way too attached to all of them way too fast and gets insanely jealous over their behaviour) she literally breaks down like a toddler because James’ penis is small. Imagine if a dude did this like literally started crying because his girlfriends pussy was loose? The complaint itself be hailed as misogynistic but to cry in a bathroom about it??? Like we’d call this man King Baby until the end of time. She was like what? 41? Seriously if you wanna argue it’s a fantasy fine but none of the other girls or their friends have this behaviour 

2. Samantha does see sex that she wouldn’t do as bad. When that Texan woman gives a dude a blow job under the table she leaves and its insinuated that Samantha thinks it’s classless and gross. So Samantha clearly has a measuring tool and doesn’t view all sex as empowering and then she insults and distances herself from this woman even though THAT woman isn’t ashamed. Why is it cool when Samantha does this (including doing sexual stuff in public) but when this woman does it it’s cause for removal ? She’s totally hypocritical

Miranda and Samantha have the same politics around sex and yet nobody gives Miranda her tens like they do Samantha. So samanthas character being “ahead of the times” seems like it’s more a filler character then breaking barriers or whatever because Miranda does that and Miranda isn’t a fuck freak dunce and actually has a life outside dick which is much more realistic to how promiscuous women are and not a caricature of a promiscuous woman as drawn by Hugh Hefner"
1083,2020-04-21 09:02:39,g59az2,*to the tune of Andy samberg saying “doesn’t matter had sex” in the lonely island song “I just had sex”* doesn’t matter still sucks

But, what has happened under capitalism as it has matured is a reversion to feudalistic modes as organizational scale has greatly outpaced the capacity of the individual or even the small incorporation of interests. It has even worked to subvert and poison the notion of a public governance where equality and a lack of caste is a design features. In exchange we form of many smaller private entities, with private arbitration, and distinct castes and private control of the society held by a few actors. We atomoize society so far that its individual constituents can only help but float along the currents created by the larger firms that, if they fail, bring down the failure of civilization as we know it (JPow goes BrrrrrrrrrR).

The word?

PLEASE SIR PLEASE DONT MENTION VUVUZUELA I CAN'T HANDLE THE FULL MIGHT OF YOUR RHETORICAL SKILL

Alright, well let's first start by clearing the air since you want to have a real debate.

1) This was obviously a shitpost, I don't think Feudalism is better than Liberalism. The point was to show people that an economic system which is untested definitionally cant be proven to be good through empirics. Lucky for us, we do have some small scale Marxist success stories, I'll get to those in 3.
2) I don't think Liberal Market Economies are inefficient or terrible, I think they're a historical necessity rapidly approaching their terminal crisis, if you want to read more about that check my post about the TRPF and the Crisis of Liquidity.
3) Those nations which most adhered to Marx's ideals were Syndicalist Catalonia, Pre-NEP Russia, and the Paris Commune. All three of those societies were significantly more happy than their capitalist counterparts and saw significant economic improvements (Russian caloric consumption skyrocketed before the NEP).

But I'm guessing that you, like most Chuds, think that China and Venezuela are Marxist countries so let's break those down.

China is a Capitalist country. Not only is it Capitalist, I'd go so far as to say it's the most successful capitalist state today. It has private corporations, incredible international financial power, and a Government run by University technocrats. Venezuela, on the other hand, is another story. Venezuela too is Capitalist, adhering to a State Capitalist model similar to China. The reasons Venezuela has failed are manifold. They were too reliant on oil as a commodity, and when oil prices collapse then the economy goes into the shitter. But beyond that, the nation has endured a barrage of embargoes, similar to Cuba, by Western States like the US that have crippled their economic growth. If Great Britain convinced all of Europe to tariff the fledgling American Republic it would have seen similar issues, because Venezuela is a developing State which was never allowed to develop.

Those fee States which were actually Marxist all fell due to Western Imperialism, Russia faced military pressure from the West which strongarmed Lenin into the NEP, Catalonia was crushed by Franco, and the Paris Commune was brutally repressed by reactionaries in Europe. Economic systems are inherently global, so long as a deviation appears the system will do everything in its power to crush it. That was the whole point of this post. Liberalism isn't successful until it's applied internationally, just as Communism won't ever have a success story until it's internationalized, because the Liberal system will crush any state which begins to bare resemblance to Communism."

It literally does though. Francisco Franco brutally crushed Syndicalist Catalonia, the French Foreign Legion put down the Paris Commune, and the NEP was a necessary compromise Lenin had to make if he wanted to put an end to the myriad of trade embargoes nations had placed on Russia.

Collectivization isn't Communist, and the deaths you mentioned in the Great Leap Forward were primarily due to the rapid industrial advancements that were forced by the government, resulting in a reduction in farm laborers. In an industrialized society, like Marx said the revolution would need to occur in, these issues are non-existent.

> Then you make a second error, Imperialism is a different ism from Capitalism, you should stop reading what marxists write so much it will only help you in the long run. 

Okay? Sure I'll concede the semantics because it's irrelevant to my broader point: external pressure crushed successful Communist regimes. A point which you have not countered.

> No economic systems are not at all inherantly global, are you mad? Take the communists/socialists communes in all the capitalist countries for example, or why not the Amish, or any of the other religious communes. 

Name one, sweetie. Even the Kibbutz and Onida Silver Company communes trade their wares on a Liberal Market, and the Amish often will sell their wares to the outside world. Liberalism is a totalizing economic system no matter how much you insist it isn't.

> Liberalism functions very well in the countries which tries it, in fact it has never failed if you add in Private Property and Free Markets which is exactly what capitalism is.

It really is typical of Capitalists to care more about semantics than actual substance isn't it? I offer a substantive critique of the Capitalist understanding of the Soviet Union and your main complaint is that I used a word you didn't like.

Marx was an historical materialist who believed materialist forces would lead to communism globally replacing capitalism. An idealist force, such as a debate on the theoretical level, should not be necessary for communism to replace capitalism since materialist forces will make that happen regardless. Yet I see communists using idealist forces all over the Internet to attempt to educate and persuade non-communists.

More labour = more supply = less value

Just as USSR decided to use some ""capitalist"" policies (NEP, imperialism), and I won't fault capitalism for decisions that USSR made.

Capitalism in this pure form you protect does not exist. Similarly, socialism always changed when met with reality, and that's why workers didn't actually control all Means of Production in socialist countries, and those countries often implemented some free market solutions at some point."

Dean Smith is a legendary figure in the state of NC, a man of impeccable ethics and a fiery morality.

Indiana? Don’t make me laugh.

Duke needs to prove it can be great without Coach K, and not struggle after he leaves like UCLA.

I personally don't think the positives outweigh the negatives, but people are free to disagree. If you are among those that disagree, you should be getting pretty excited about the real possibility of the NCAA and member schools getting pretty seriously ""fucked.""

I dunno, why are you so excited to defend a corrupt organization that fucks over so many people?

You're still being disingenuous. If the NCAA were to be dismantled another organization could (and would) fill its place. There's no reason to defend them like you are, especially as you continue to put words in people's mouths over and over again.

What you're doing is as if people want to put a criminal in jail for robbing a bank, and you're saying ""oh fine let the people that go to McDonald's starve!"" just because the thief also works at McDonald's. Nope, still robbed the bank! There are plenty who'll work at McDonald's and not rob that bank!

The hate isn't blind, it's easily and rightfully justified. It's an extremely profitable organization that exists to make money through exerting control over its athletes. The less-visible and less-profitable ""positives"" still are a form of control exerted over athletes that exist to prop up the parts that are profitable, and there are many, many alternatives that don't exploit youths.

Think so? I mean, can you describe this organization to me and walk me through how it is formed? I mean, the NCAA has nearly half a million participants. On top of that, there is a *massive* difference in the fundamental structure of what defines ""fair"" in the eyes of the people actually involved. 

My *guess* is that what you actually favor is an organization either isn't going to realistically materialize *or* that won't *actually* result in a scenario where nobody is getting ""fucked."" 

> I dunno, why are you so excited to defend a corrupt organization that fucks over so many people? 

Sounds like a strawman to me. Maybe you can quote where I said I was ""excited"" about defending the NCAA? 

Can you do that? I'm guessing you can't.

> You're still being disingenuous. 

So you claim. You also claimed that I was setting up strawmen but haven't supported that accusation when I called you out on it.

> If the NCAA were to be dismantled another organization could (and would) fill its place.  

I'm sure *something* would show up eventually to take its place. I'm simply not confident that what we got as a replacement would be significantly better. More to the point, I'm not sure if what we got would be worth the amount of teams and scholarships that we'd lose in the meantime. 

If you want to make the case that something better *would* show up and that it would be worth the costs in terms of lost educational opportunities, then let's hear the details behind your assumption.

> There's no reason to defend them like you are, especially as you continue to put words in people's mouths over and over again.

LOL, what a terrible analogy. Seriously, how can you throw this out there and then accuse *me* of being disingenuous?

I mean, is anyone defending the NCAA doing shit that is actually illegal? I know that I sure as fuck am not doing that. I 100% believe that they need to be operating in compliance with all applicable and state regulations.

Beyond that, is anyone dumb enough to think that an organization like the NCAA is as easy to seamlessly replace as a McDonald's cashier?

An upper bound on the maximum current when pulling the output towards VSS, is

I was a wizard, so my friend got me a real life quill with invisible ink, so my character started writing her spell book spells in ""magic ink"" 🤣"
1403,2020-05-03 22:46:21,gcsht3,"No, but one campaign I kept track of the calendar in game and let the players know when their character's birthday's and anniversaries came up in game."
1404,2020-05-03 17:46:45,gcsht3,"Only thing I've done like this is when I moved, I gifted the miniatures I bought and painted for their characters, using a 3d custom printed box. Man I miss that group..."
1405,2020-05-04 02:10:35,gcsht3,"Hell yes. If they somehow score too much treasure, bring up the yearly gift-giving holiday. As a bonus, sell them some less than adventuresome but still attention getting magic items, like one year they gifted a Bottomless Pit Beer Tankard and a Pan of Frying."
1406,2020-05-03 19:08:21,gcsht3,"In the previous campaign, on my birthday my PC almost got killed…

I mean, in-fiction almost. OC this was never a real danger. Also, it wasn't intentional, just a result of rolls. It was the best present I got, because it gave me a ton of spotlight, and drama, and feels. And I looove those things.

But no, we don't do intentional birthday events."
1407,2020-05-04 05:13:56,gcsht3,"Did something similar, but I never mixed players' and characters' lives.  
I always have a calendar of events in my campaigns, and some of these events might be bound to gift exchange traditions.  
Since I've had a more or less stable core of players, the voice spread already from the first campaign, so people who came to play with me knew this was a thing.  
I'm proud to admit that other GMs in my area started doing the same, after playing with me!"
1408,2020-05-03 17:26:38,gcsht3,"The only problem with this is that it brings the player into the game, rather than the character being there.  The player is an abstract outside of the game."
1409,2020-05-04 01:51:51,gcsht3,I’ve done this! It’s generally well-received.
1410,2020-05-04 03:09:50,gcsht3,"I dislike meta intrusions into rpgs, but if characters give gifts to characters on the characters' birthdays, that's good... er, when appropriate for the characters' culture."
1411,2020-05-04 08:59:38,gcsht3,I do this in my games as well. We mostly do Powered by the Apocalypse stuff so I typically give them a free advance or a move of their choice. I usually give them an Advance on my birthday as well.
1412,2020-05-03 18:29:22,gcsht3,"Happy birthday!

That's exactly the kind of present in talking about"
1413,2020-05-04 00:54:07,gcsht3,That's a very cool idea
1414,2020-05-03 18:31:21,gcsht3,"Yeah, it breaks the fourth wall, so to speak.

In character, you don't need to connect the present to the player. To the character it's just a random occurrence."
1415,2020-05-03 18:59:24,gcsht3,"Thank you :3   
It was pretty awesome :D  
And when I have had players with birthdays I usually give them something as well"

1459,2020-05-03 14:50:43,gcreo2,😂😂
1460,2020-05-03 14:53:22,gcreo2,They are broadcasting pre recorded videos !!

1465,2020-05-03 14:55:21,gcreo2,Seasoned musicians are class apart . Zakir Hussain is too good
1466,2020-05-03 14:55:24,gcreo2,After having so many stars averaging around 60K views
1467,2020-05-03 14:55:48,gcreo2,Will the whole video be available for rewatching?
1468,2020-05-03 14:56:28,gcreo2,u/Street-Fig - I am sure it will be available later and fan clubs will post their Star’s videos later
1469,2020-05-03 14:56:40,gcreo2,Vidya Balan ❤️❤️
1470,2020-05-03 14:57:02,gcreo2,Her voice is magical.

1473,2020-05-03 14:59:13,gcreo2,America had a big influence on Madhuri..
1474,2020-05-03 14:59:21,gcreo2,"Madhuri’s son is good looking .
Maddy also sings !!"
1475,2020-05-03 14:59:22,gcreo2,Very good song❤️

1478,2020-05-03 15:01:24,gcreo2,"I would’ve preferred her dance , here we got to see her son as well"
1479,2020-05-03 15:02:30,gcreo2,Maybe viewers will increase but 60k during lockdown is not very successful
1480,2020-05-03 15:02:52,gcreo2,Jack Black is here.. Why??
1481,2020-05-03 15:03:19,gcreo2,Very poor viewership
1482,2020-05-03 15:04:07,gcreo2,"Yup, Instagram live for these stars can easily get over 200k viewers live"
1483,2020-05-03 15:04:27,gcreo2,Content is poor so far
1484,2020-05-03 15:05:57,gcreo2,Whose idea was it to make Kat do an interview
1485,2020-05-03 15:09:36,gcreo2,Sunidhi Chauhan showing she doesn't need some upbeat music to sing a party number
1486,2020-05-03 15:09:56,gcreo2,Sunidhi is singing live and is so good !!
1487,2020-05-03 15:10:16,gcreo2,Yes it's good
1488,2020-05-03 15:12:13,gcreo2,Content is very bad.
1489,2020-05-03 15:12:52,gcreo2,Their was no need for Katrina and Kartik but whole KJO gang is going to be here
1490,2020-05-03 15:13:44,gcreo2,Jay Sean is Good
1491,2020-05-03 15:14:06,gcreo2,how much do we think they WOULD be able to raise given the content vs how much they SHOULD be able to raise given the line up? estimates anyone?
1492,2020-05-03 15:14:52,gcreo2,Madhuri’s performance clip on Twitter -
1493,2020-05-03 15:14:55,gcreo2,https://twitter.com/siddanthdaily/status/1256963421720981504?s=21
1494,2020-05-03 15:16:10,gcreo2,Only accessible from app. I'll pass.
1495,2020-05-03 15:18:19,gcreo2,Looks like people can just sing or say something.
1496,2020-05-03 15:18:32,gcreo2,Reddit live has more viewership than this event
1497,2020-05-03 15:20:21,gcreo2,I am leaving
1498,2020-05-03 15:20:27,gcreo2,"this chat thread is my only source of the concert. I think lower viewership is because it's Facebook and the content. it's easier to attend live on IG or YouTube. More people would have joined had it been that, even with the same content. Facebook feels too tasking. or maybe that's just me."
1499,2020-05-03 15:21:10,gcreo2,"It’s too boring , I can’t continue"
1500,2020-05-03 15:22:23,gcreo2,They should’ve done in YT.
1501,2020-05-03 15:22:52,gcreo2,Someone with American brain planned this event
1502,2020-05-03 15:23:08,gcreo2,I would have preferred if it was all singers. These small actors' segments in between are doing nothing for me.
1503,2020-05-03 15:25:07,gcreo2,"Any idea, what has been the highest viewership of this event till now?"
1504,2020-05-03 15:25:34,gcreo2,Is there a LIVE counter on how much they have raised so far?
1505,2020-05-03 15:26:54,gcreo2,little more than 1.5cr till now
1506,2020-05-03 15:27:06,gcreo2,that was a good poem by Ayushman
1507,2020-05-03 15:28:00,gcreo2,I liked Ayushmann's poem ❤
1508,2020-05-03 15:28:06,gcreo2,started from around 60 lakh though when the concert started
1509,2020-05-03 15:28:12,gcreo2,Tag me someone if Alia shows up. Thanks

1514,2020-05-03 15:57:29,gcreo2,Kareena can’t even look at Camera when she is sitting by side . How below average are A listers without Director n script
1515,2020-05-03 16:02:07,gcreo2,I have always for some reason underestimated B Praak as an artist. He is much better than I expected him to be
1516,2020-05-03 16:06:08,gcreo2,Link?
1517,2020-05-03 16:43:51,gcreo2,Has Alia performed yet?
1518,2020-05-03 16:46:45,gcreo2,No one is watching it. Alia will speak for 30 secs probably
1519,2020-05-03 16:51:38,gcreo2,I liked the AR rehman gig
1520,2020-05-03 16:51:56,gcreo2,The singer Ehan Bhat or something was fab!!
1521,2020-05-03 16:52:06,gcreo2,Got goosebumps

1527,2020-05-03 17:04:15,gcreo2,Is the concert a hit????
1528,2020-05-03 17:07:48,gcreo2,Yup ..elite are just gonna cry fake tears at a reality show and come up with a story on how they were not able to spend their vacation in Alps as a kid and that devastated them
1529,2020-05-03 17:08:49,gcreo2,"what a question by Mr. Johar???? ""How do you manage to look so fashionable during this lockdown?"" to someone who is one of the richest in India aka Natasha Poonawalla...... People are praying for this pandemic to go and all they care about is looks and clothes????"
1530,2020-05-03 17:12:10,gcreo2,I love Diljit's voice
1531,2020-05-03 17:17:49,gcreo2,Natasha and Adar Poonawalla have a combined net worth of $15b
1532,2020-05-03 17:18:09,gcreo2,Hollywood and Bollywood are nothing for them
1533,2020-05-03 17:19:05,gcreo2,Just waiting for Arijit Singh and Pritam tbh
1534,2020-05-03 17:21:03,gcreo2,Did anybody liked Lilly Singh's video clip???? It was kind of overacting I guess.
1535,2020-05-03 17:21:48,gcreo2,This is the most boring concert
1536,2020-05-03 17:31:49,gcreo2,I loved Parineeti's singing..... Oh! God it reminds me how much I miss her onscreen... She's definitely talented just drowned with same characters she been playing since her debut
1537,2020-05-03 17:33:48,gcreo2,The only thing worse than Hrithik's singing was his piano playing.
1538,2020-05-03 17:37:25,gcreo2,Please no Alia Bhatt please
1539,2020-05-03 17:39:13,gcreo2,Did her sis really have to be there?
1540,2020-05-03 17:39:50,gcreo2,Alia Bhatt sang really well

1546,2020-05-03 17:45:29,gcreo2,Arijits singing was definitely worth the 4 hour wait 🔥😭🙏🏾
1547,2020-05-03 17:45:52,gcreo2,these people instead of thanking frontline workers can thry donate them some bonus?
1548,2020-05-03 17:47:19,gcreo2,Give them 10% hike immediately + some money according to their salary (even Rs 1000 for some blue collar workers or security gaurds) will go a long way. Why are people so obtuse? Why not spend the money on them instead of aeroplanes doing shit stunts ?
1549,2020-05-03 17:47:41,gcreo2,Rohit Sharma look like one of my online coaching class sir😛 The way his face is online now is making me take out my reasoning notebook and start revising the chapters lol

1634,2020-05-03 15:29:47,gcqrnv,">One is Sister Location and one is Fredbear’s Family Diner.

Sister Location opened after Fredbear's and Freddy's closed.

>His son is Michael Afton, and his older son is unknown.

Michael is the big bro.


>is son Michael Afton has nightmares of the animatronics in FFD and cries a lot because his Nightmare bothers him

Michael had the nightmares after FNaF1.

>What William meant by that is to build an adult robot body

Even if Michael was the younger brother, he can't be a robot.

>One day Charlie was at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. The puppet was left on security mode by Henry to protect his daughter. And yeah it protects ONLY his daughter and nobody else. Three kids wanted to bully Charlie but they couldn’t cause Charlie was being protected by puppet. So the kids decided to put a gift on top of the huge gift box puppet gets in when it is in. Now they have puppet/marionette trapped and they decide to go after Charlie. It was raining outside and the three children forcefully lock Charlie outside and leave her. Puppet tries to get out but can’t.

>Charlie is crying and then a purple car appears, it was William. He got out of the car and stabbed Charlie and drove away in his car. Charlie started screaming and crying but no one besides puppet heard her. Puppet finally gets out of the box with force and goes outside to find Charlie as Charlie lays by the garbage. Puppet starts going after Charlie but malfunctions while doing that cause of the rain and it is an animatronic. Finally it reached Charlie and lay by her and short-circuited. Charlie is dead and her soul goes in puppet. Henry is now grieving and William was not done.

>After Charlie William kills four more children: Gabriel, Jeremy, Susie and Fritz. When he does that puppet resurrects them in four animatronics: Gabriel as Freddy, Jeremy as Bonnie, Susie as Chica and Fritz as Foxy. After that the restaurant was shutdown for a bit.

This all happened in 1983.

>The animatronics like Freddy, Bonnie, Chica and Foxy are now not useable anymore and are replaced by Toy Freddy, Toy Bonnie, Toy Chica and Mangle. 

The first Freddy's was opened in 1983. 

>o they made ennard but then they kicked Elizabeth out and Elizabeth was back in Circus Baby. 

Elizabeth was kicked out of Ennard long after Michael was scooped.

>Michael all of the sudden disagrees with the plan and accomplish his shift and goes home but Ennard was following him. Michael watches a tv show and when he finishes ennard appears. 

This ending is called the FAKE ending for a reason. The ending in which Michael gets hit with the Scooper is the REAL ending.

>and Michael has Ennard in his body.

Ennard should have abandoned Michael after one week of being in his body.

>William kills one more child called Cassidy and he hid her body in the Fredbear animatronic. 

That was a part of the Missing Children Incident.

>Michael does start to get unhealthy and start to smell cause Ennard is in him and now he is getting bad odor. (1987)

>Michael wants to work again but he does look a bit unhealthy and green. (1990's)

>That is because he is getting more and more unhealthy cause Ennard is in him.  (1990's)

>Michael is turning all purple and getting more unhealthy. (2023)

>After that Michael got really purple. And one day while walking down the street he puked ennard out into the sewer.  (2023)

You know this all happened in *one week*, right?

>After that one day Mangle bit a kids frontal lobe off. 

The victim wasn't a child.

>Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, Fredbear, Springbonnie, Puppet, Mangle and balloon boy. 

Mangle and BB were scrapped, and the Puppet most likely escaped on her own or was buyed out by Henry.

>The animatronics in Fazbear’s Fright are about 7 of them in total. There are Phantom Mangle, Phantom Puppet, PBB (Phantom Balloon Boy), Phantom Freddy, Phantom Foxy, Phantom Chica and Springbonnie. 

The Phantoms aren't real.

>Michael opens up his own location with the help of Fazbear Entertainment

Henry opened the location, Michael was just a manager.

>Cassidy chose to be in hell waiting for William

Why would she go to Hell?

>The Ultimate Custom Night.

Which isn't even confirmed to be canon.

>The end

You forgot about FNaFVR and FNaFAR."

1636,2020-05-03 20:56:16,gcqrnv,"I already wrote a comment debunking like a 60% of all of this in the other post (that's exactly the same as this one, I don't know why you reposted the same thing), but I'm still writing everything again.

1- CHARLIE WASN'T KILLED IN FREDDY'S. SHE WAS KILLED IN FREDBEAR'S, IN 1983.

2- SISTER LOCATION WASN'T OPENED AT THE SAME TIME AS FREDBEAR'S.

3- FRITZ AND SUSIE WERE KILLED IN 1983, AND THE OTHERS IN 1985, IN THE OG FREDDY'S, NOT IN FNaF 2.

4- THE PHANTOMS AREN'T REAL.

5- ENNARD LEAVES MICHAEL'S BODY AFTER A WEEK OF USING IT.

6- The rest is mostly right. But FNaF 3 was never confirmed to take place in 2023 (I think it happens in 2015). Henry has another child named Sammy. And, although the majority of the fandom believes the Afton Family theory, NO ONE KNOWS IF IT'S TRUE."
1637,2020-05-03 22:03:36,gcqrnv,"> CHARLIE WASN'T KILLED IN FREDDY'S. SHE WAS KILLED IN FREDBEAR'S, IN 1983.

She was killed in a location with a BROWN bear.

> FRITZ AND SUSIE WERE KILLED IN 1983, AND THE OTHERS IN 1985, IN THE OG FREDDY'S, NOT IN FNaF 2.

I don’t know where you got that from, all the MCI kids were killed on the same day.

> But FNaF 3 was never confirmed to take place in 2023

It’s confirmed. It’s set 30 years after FNaF 1, which is in 1993.

>the Afton Family theory

I’m curious. What do you mean by “Afton family theory”?"
1638,2020-05-04 12:22:32,gcqrnv,"Oh hey it’s you again. 
1. I did change something and that is Michael using only Fritz Smith and Mike Schmidt as fake ids and not Jeremy Fitzgerald plus I said a kid got his frontal lobe bit off this time and not Michael. But of course you didn’t notice because like I said it’s a small thing I changed. 
2. Where did you get that from the “the other half were killed later” cause I’m still sticking with them being killed at the same time. 
3. I already know that the Phantoms aren’t real now and I think I already said it this time
4. Do you have source about Charlotte being killed in FFD. I mean tbh it’s pretty possible cause we gave cake to children as Freddy while she was being killed and Freddy and his gang were at FFD as well but you don’t believe that but why do the children that bullied the Crying Child have masks of Freddy and his gang."
1639,2020-05-04 21:05:01,gcqrnv,Okay this may be getting annoying for you but I’m back to thinking Freddy and his gang being at FFD again. When you play fnaf 4 and go to the tv in the mini games you can clearly see Freddy and his gang plus Fredbear on the add of the FFD in 1983.
1640,2020-05-04 13:18:45,gcqrnv,"1- I didn't notice, but I didn't complain about what you said in the first place, it'll sound very weird, but I do believe Michael is the victim of the Bite of '87.

2- Susie must have been killed in 1983, we know this because of the urban legend of people getting stuffed into animatronics, that is mentioned in FNaF 4. Fritz (who isn't confirmed to be the second, but I still think he is) must have disappeared a short time after Susie, and before the others did, we know this because the TWO newspapers in FNaF 1. One talks about TWO kids going missing, and the other one says that other 3 children went missing.

3- Ok

4- FNaF 3 takes place 30 years after the closure of Freddy's. There were 3 Freddy's. And casually the original one closed in 1985, and 30 years after that would be 2015.

5- There was a Freddy's previous to the one from FNaF 2. It was confirmed 5 years ago, by Phone Guy in the FNaF 2 and 3 messages. I think Charlie was killed in Fredbear's, because the location of the minigame is very small and only has one active aninatronic. And in the OG book trilogy, Charlie has a memory of William trying to kill her and her brother at Fredbear's, and in her memory he took Sammy, but later William reveals he didn't kill Sammy, but Charlie.

6- This is gonna sound a bit weird or even stupid for some people, but, the Afton Family theory is basically the one that states the FNaF 4 house and children are William's, and although the majority of people have accepted it, there's a lot of evidence that goes against it."
1641,2020-05-04 21:21:18,gcqrnv,"It's not an add of FFD. It's an ad for a tv show based on Freddy's and Fredbear's named ""Fredbear and Friends""."
1642,2020-05-05 19:47:11,gcqrnv,"> There were 3 Freddy's. And casually the original one closed in 1985, and 30 years after that would be 2015.

It’s set 30 years after Freddy’s shut down, which happened in 1993.

You’re right it does sound stupid. Especially since there’s no good evidence against it. How do you explain William monitoring it? Or Michael LIVING in it?"
1643,2020-05-04 13:56:27,gcqrnv,">FNaF 3 takes place 30 years after the closure of Freddy's. There were 3 Freddy's. And casually the original one closed in 1985, and 30 years after that would be 2015.

We are talking about the closing of the third Freddy's, which closed in 1993. If they were talking about the first Freddy's, it would be adressed."
1644,2020-05-04 15:38:07,gcqrnv,"1. You are wrong it wasn’t Michael who got bit by Mangle in 87 it was some random kid. Because if you listen to the radio Mangle has carefully you can hear someone say something like “101 a kid has lost his frontal lobe. I don’t think he can make it” and stuff. Not exactly like I said but something like I said about the radio hearing.

2. William kills 8 children: Charlie, Cassidy, Gabriel, Susie, Jeremy, Fritz and two unknown children that the posters of fnaf 1 say. And what you said is not what the posters say read it again. It says two children were killed by a man in a suit. And then after that five more children got killed the same way the two children got killed. Now the two children at first are unknown random kids because we know that Gabriel and his friends and stuff got killed at the same time besides Cassidy. I know you are confused but hear me out. What I think is four children got killed after that one more called Cassidy after a couple of days. The four children called Gabriel, Jeremy, Susie and Fritz got killed after the two unknown children the same way as the unknown children but their body didn’t get stuffed in some animatronics by William cause if their body was in the animatronics their souls would be in it and Puppet wouldn’t have to resurrect them. So BECAUSE their body is just hidden somewhere puppet resurrects them. And it clearly resurrects four children: Gabriel as Freddy, Susie as Chica, Jeremy as Bonnie and Fritz as Foxy. Later after a couple of days William kills one more called Cassidy but this time he hides the body in an animatronic but which one? It’s Fredbear. Remember when at night 6 phone guy finds out someone used a Fredbear animatronic in fnaf 2 and gets scared? Well William is the one who did that by hiding Cassidy’s body in Fredbear and if you don’t believe me Fredbear literally appears at night 6 (the day phone guy gets scared) the day someone used an animatronic. And that way Cassidy becomes Fredbear and that is why puppet didn’t have to resurrect Cassidy and only resurrected four children 

3. I think Scott confirmed fnaf 3 takes place in 2023

4. Charlotte is the only child of Henry.
 
5. You keep saying there was another Freddy’s are you talking about juniors? Y’know the one we see at the mini games of fnaf 6."
1645,2020-05-04 22:42:29,gcqrnv,Oh okay but how do you know that.
1646,2020-05-05 20:29:24,gcqrnv,"1- It doesn't specifies after the closure of which Freddy's.

2- I don't mean that the theory is stupid. What I wanted to say is that it may sound stupid or weird that I don't believe in it, although like a 75% of the fandom does."
1647,2020-05-04 15:48:39,gcqrnv,"Not really, we're talking about FNaF after all, the minimum detail is normally kept unexplained."
1648,2020-05-04 15:53:33,gcqrnv,"1- I wasn't aware of that, I haven't seen anyone but you, talk about it.

2- The first newspapers says 2 children have gone missing at Freddy's, and the 2nd one says the number of children disappearances has extended to 5.

3- No, he hasn't.

4- No, he has 2 children.

5- No, I'm not talknig about Jr's. Jr's may not even be a Freddy's. Just search any timeline video or listen to the FNaF 2 messages. I honestly can't believe you weren't aware of the existence of the original Freddy's."
1649,2020-05-05 00:25:01,gcqrnv,"It literally says Fredbear and Friends at the end of the ad, and there's no restaurant named like that. And the complete video looks like an intro for a tv series."
1650,2020-05-05 20:39:50,gcqrnv,"1. The only time Freddy’s truly closed its doors was after the FNaF 1 location closed, as that was when Fazbear Entertainment shut down. And FFPS confirms the date 2023 as well.

2. No, I knew exactly what you were saying. It does indeed sound stupid to not believe something that has been proven time and again. That would be like saying you didn’t agree with, say, Stitchwraith not being Ennard, you’re basically disagreeing with fact"
1651,2020-05-04 16:04:09,gcqrnv,"1. Search up Mangles radio or something and you’ll probably find it.

2. The papers say two children were missing. After that five more were missing and they are LINKED to the murders of two unknown children. 

3. Well idk man I’m still confused about the year of fnaf3 and still sticking with 2023

4. Who said Henry has two children 

5. Well I guess I will have to watch more game theory or try to get access to the books. It’s pretty hard to get access to them but I think I can handle it."
1652,2020-05-05 00:30:17,gcqrnv,Ah okay
1653,2020-05-05 22:00:14,gcqrnv,"1- Ok.

2- Not really. There's no true evidence to prove that theory."
1654,2020-05-04 16:21:08,gcqrnv,"1- Ok

2- Ok, so why the title of the 2nd newspapers is: ""Five children now reported missing"". If the newspaper was talking about completely new disappearances.

3- Like I said, I believe it takes place in 2015. The FNaF 3 technology is kinda garbage to be the year 2023.

4- In the books.

5- The evidence of that it's not just in the books, listen to the FNaF 2 messages. They confirmed the existence of a previous Freddy's before the books came out."

William monitoring the house, SL being connected to the house, William having the Fredbear plush, Michael living in the house, etc"
1656,2020-05-04 16:39:02,gcqrnv,"1. What do you mean. It says five children are missing and are linked to the first two missing children. And those five are every child’s name I mentioned besides Charlie cause she is already dead. Sorry I kind of don’t get the question

2. Ok
 
3. Ok but can you tell me more for example when the first Freddy’s existed. 

4. Uhm wasn’t phone guy talking about FFD. He was talking about FFD and then about the animatronics like Freddy and his gang. He said the idea at first was to rebuild them but they are abandoned because they smell and were a ugly. And why I thought they were all first at FFD and then got abandoned at Freddy’s at 87 that phone guy mentions is because the kids who bullied the crying child had those masks in FFD."

2- William has never been seen with the Fredbear plush.

3- How do you know Michael is living in FNaF 4's house? And, still, if he was, that doesn't mean the house belongs to the Aftons."

2- There isn't much information about it. It is known it was opened at the same time as FFD and that closed in 1985 after the MCI.

3- He refers to the FNaF 2 as the NEW and IMPROVED FREDDY FAZBEAR'S PIZZA; forget what you've heard about the OLD LOCATION. And in FNaF 4 the Fazbear isn't seen anywhere in FFD. FFD is referred as the ORIGINAL LOCATION, as if there was another one between FFD and the FNaF 2 one."

1664,2020-05-04 18:43:06,gcqrnv,Oh okay so if the children died in the first Freddy’s then it must’ve been in 85 cause that’s when it is closed? And you said sis location didn’t exist in 83 but if you check Elizabeth’s room in fnaf4 there is a head of Funtime Foxy. At first I thought it was Mangle but it can’t be cause Mangle is in 87. But what year did you think it existed and do you have source and if it’s from the books you know that from can you tell me which one.
1665,2020-05-06 13:29:05,gcqrnv,"1- In Count the Ways, the antagonist is Ft. Freddy, and that story takes place after 2003 (we know this because the existence of Skype), maybe Eleanor isn't Baby, but I'm pretty sure Ft. Freddy is Ft. Freddy. This means Sister Location takes place in the 2000's, and by that time, William was already trapped in Freddy's safe room. What I think is that after the MCI at CBPW, the place was put into investigation (I believe CBPW opened in the late 90's), and he had to run away, but before, he told Michael to search for Elizabeth. If William was the manager of the place, why would he send Michael? 

2- So, if it isn't William managing the place, the plush must be owned by the manager, or some relative... (Henry?)

3- There's no lamp in the living room, in the FNaF 4 minigames.

It's gonna sound weird, but I think CBPW opened in 1997, at least that's the year it opens in the books. But CBER (Circus Baby's Entertainment and Rental) is basically confirmed to have opened in the 2000's, To Be Beautiful and Count the Ways confirmed it. And for the ""thing"" in the ""girl's room"", I'm writing a theory on that. I'm planning to post it in a couple days, and I'll probably reply to this comment with the link when it's ready."
1667,2020-05-06 13:37:34,gcqrnv,"1. Count The Ways isn’t canon. The Funtime Freddy in it is completely different from our Funtime Freddy, as it’s much bigger, acts completely different, is missing Bon-Bon, and was in a junkyard. Also, William sent Michael there probably for him to die.

2. No. William owns the place. It’s his private room, with his monitors, showing his house, and has his son’s plush

3. Tell that to the nights."
1668,2020-05-04 20:04:44,gcqrnv,"Ah okay. But the tapes of fnaf 3 mention that the suits cannot be used after an incident at Sister location which is the scoop incident of Elizabeth and then phone guy in tape says safety is our top priority in Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. Now it can be either the 83-85, 87 or 93 Freddy’s. But the phone guy of fnaf 3 said listen to these tapes they are like so old like prehistoric and stuff. And that means it can be 83."
1669,2020-05-06 13:49:15,gcqrnv,"1- Count the Ways is canon. All the funtimes are supposed to be big, and both do act exactly the same. BonBon being missing doesn't mean anything. I don't remember that the junkyard thing was mentioned in the story, but, still, if it was, it makes sense. After the closure of CBPW, the funtimes weren't going to stay there until someone found them, and they also aren't going to be walking the streets freely for someone to capture or dismantle them.

2- Ok, it's in the house. But it's a lamp model, anyone can buy a lamp like that. And yes, I know Scott doesn't do coincidences, so, again, I'm finishing my theory. I won't reply to your next comment until I've finished it."

1671,2020-05-06 13:57:16,gcqrnv,">Count the Ways is canon. 

No it really isn’t.

>All the funtimes are supposed to be big

This guy is a giant. He’s big enough to hold a teenager with room for her to slightly move around as well as several death traps. This Funtime Freddy would be at least the size of Baby, which means he isn’t the same as the game FT Freddy.

>both do act exactly the same. 

No they don’t. CTW FT Freddy is calm, intelligent, and doesn’t just spew the same pre-recorded party themed voice lines. And he also barely laughs as well. He acts completely different from FT Freddy.

>BonBon being missing doesn't mean anything. 

Bon-Bon is a very important part of Funtime Freddy.

>I don't remember that the junkyard thing was mentioned in the story, but, still, if it was, it makes sense. After the closure of CBPW, the funtimes weren't going to stay there until someone found them, and they also aren't going to be walking the streets freely for someone to capture or dismantle them.

No. After CBPW closed they were moved to CBEAR, remember? That was like the entire point of SL’s location"
1672,2020-05-04 20:15:11,gcqrnv,"1. It does. Phone guy in the tapes says the suits cannot be used after an incident at Sister location 

2. Wait what why would they mention Sister location then. I mean what I think is that they used a code name for CBPW as Sister location and it can’t be FFD cause why would it be."

Two more benefits of adding Gorr:

1) It can introduce other pantheons of gods like the Greek gods (Hercules!) and whichever others they wish to explore. 

2) Gorr's sword could and should be the very thing that produces symbiotes. Gorr's presence and combat can lead to symbiotes being expelled into the world accidentally. Or maybe Gorr does it intentionally as an interesting way to destroy worlds."

So as a geologist, true fact, the depiction of Stan Olber in Volcano melting into lava is actually pretty accurate. Granted it's FAR more graphic in the movie novelization. Generally scenes like where people ""fall in"" to lava and they go -blorp- and just sink beneith the surface wouldn't happen due to the fact the human body is very considerably less dense than the liquid stone. We'd burn up and melt on the surface rather than go -blorp-.

Fifth week of Netflix viewings, and probably the final week. There's only so much stuff of interest that can be found on such a streaming service when it comes to movies. As usual Horror and Sci-Fi is what I have been watching.

- The Rage: Carrie 2 (1999) - 7/10. A suprisingly good sequel. Same sort of structure as the first film with some good bloody effects during the final scene.
- The Perfection (2019) - 7/10. A refreshing modern horror that I had no idea how was going to transpire. Go in blind and watch it. The final act is especially good.
- The Purge (2013) - 7/10. Interesting concept where once every year for one night any and all crime is legal in USA, which has been effective in reducing the over all crime rate. Ethan Hawke stars as someone protecting his family during ""The Purge"" from within his household during their lockdown.
- The Purge: Anarchy (2014) - 7/10. Expands upon the interesting concept further and is just a bit more entertaining than the first entry.
- Eerie (2018) - 6/10. Chilling slow-burner Horror from the Philippines. Has some decent scares and atmosphere.
- ARQ (2016) - 6/10
- Rattlesnake (2019) - 6/10
- Robocop 3 (1993) - 6/10
- The Unthinkable (2018) - 6/10. 
- The Visit (2015) - 6/10. Kind of decent ""found-footage"" horror from M. Night Shyamalan.
- Final Destination 5 (2011) - 6/10
- A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) - 5/10. Has nothing on any of the original films at all.
- FearDotCom (2002) - 2/10. One of the worst, most ugly, most messy films I've seen. Why did I watch this all?"
1726,2020-05-03 12:08:47,gcon2v,"....last two weeks

                                                   **Week one**

**The Island (1978)** : Michael Caine and his kid crash on a mysterious Island filled with goofy pirates and shit gets unintentionally funny and hairy...like Ed Wood funny. Good score from Morricone though, that takes it from a 4/10 to a **5/10**. 

**Gemini Man (2019)** : meh, it was ok. The de-aging looked good, action scenes were good. The very ending (campus scene) was horrifyingly cheesy and Smith^3 was lame. **6/10**

**Shampoo (1975)** C^^2 : Warren Beatty plays a hairdresser who bangs mondo pussy and is still dissatisfied with his life...gimme a break. **6.5/10** 1.5 points for Julie Christie saying “I want to suck his cock”. Brrrrriiiiiinnnnngggggg 

**Pet Semetary (2019)** : A family moves into a house with super creaky doors....pffft. **4/10**

**Klute (1971)** C^^2 : Klute! **6.5/10**

**Bunny Lake is Missing (1965)** C^^2 : Otto Preminger’s film about a 4 year old American girl who goes missing from an English boarding school/daycare. Really cool, messed up story, some wicked dialogue delivered by Noël Coward as the creepy, drunk neighbour and Lawrence Olivier as the Inspector trying to figure out if the girl even existed in the first place. Excellent whodunnit also starring Keir Dullea and Carol Lynley as the uncle and mother of the kid. Movie takes a spin down bizzaro lane at the end but it’s most gratifying. **7/10**

**The Dark Past (1948)** C^^2 : Tamer remake of Blind Alley (1938) with Lee J Cobb and William Holden as the Psychiatrist and escaped con. Pretty much scene for scene remake but pretty boy Holden playing a killer con is equivalent to a growling puppy dog. Chester Morris in Blind Alley was waaaaay better. Another one of Criterion channels Columbia Noir collection. **5.5/10**

**Near Dark (1987)** C^^2 : Kathryn Bigelow’s vampire tale about a young okie buck who gets bit and dragged along by a gang of Aliens cast members. Third time I’ve watched it, first time...loved it, second time...meh, this time I’d say it’s an even **6.5 or 7/10**. The Tangerine Dream score is cool. 

**The Naked Prey (1965)** C^^2 : Cornel Wilde stars, directs and produced this tale about a white safari leader who gets caught and hunted for sport by a local tribe in 1800’s Africa. Wilde goes full out Apocalypto on their asses. Solid movie, beautiful Bechuanaland and Rhodesian scenery, exciting from start to finish and an awesome finish it was...respect, bro. **7/10**

**The Mob (1951)** C^^2 : Broderick Crawford saunters around and makes snide comments for 90 mins. Good noir with Crawford playing a cop who goes undercover on the docks so he can infiltrate the mob and take down their #1. Ernest Borgnine and Neville Brand round out the cast as tough guys. **6/10**

**Extraction (2020)** : Thor John Wick’s his way thru Bangladesh using Call of Duty Jason Bourne type tactics to deliver a drug king’s kid to some people for some reason. No brainer action flick with competent fight/action scenes (Thor beats the living shit out of a bunch of kids, so hilarious).Laaaaame ending. **5.5/10**

                                                          **Week two**

**Affair in Trinidad (1952)** C^^2 : Columbia Noir collection. Glenn Ford and Rita Hayworth star in this half decent intrigue. **5.5/10**

**For All Mankind (2019)** : season one of Apple tv’s solid series on NASA’s “what could’ve been” space program. America decides to keep pushing the space program in the 70’s with the goal of a lunar base and eventually get to Mars. Very well written alternate history, good casting, the characters are well thought out and topical for today’s social climate, visual effects are nice, exciting and emotional at times (I fist pumped a couple times). Had a good time with this series, highly recommended to any enthusiasts of space exploration or just quality tv. **8.5/10**

**Girl Shy (1924)** C^^2 : Criterion’s Observations on Film Art # 14. The opening 14 min. supplement has Author David Bordwell talking about how Harold Lloyd helped start the movement of silents becoming more narrative based rather than just hijinks. It’s a good film, the last act is pretty much just Lloyd flying across town in different modes of transport to stop a wedding...guy had some brass balls. Some of the stunts are very cool but I visibly cringed when the horse wiped out on asphalt. **7/10**

**The Player (1992)** C^^2 : Criterion’s Observations on Film Art # 15. Supplement is a 13 min. walk thru from Jeff Smith on Altman’s using genre tropes to portray the fickleness of Hollywood. The movie itself is a solid watch from that great long take at the beginning to the slap in the Hays Code face ending. One of my favourite Altman movies. **8/10**

**Castle of the Living Dead (1964)** : Old budget horror with Christopher Lee as a Count who collects living human specimens for his science project diorama. An old hag, a dwarf and Donald Sutherland also star. **5/10**

**High Life (2018)** : Odd movie but really pretty to look at. **5.5/10**"
1727,2020-05-03 13:59:38,gcon2v,"Yours:

Only seen *Eastern Promises*, which I think is good, but not among Cronenberg's best. 

Mine:

**Rebels of the Neon God** (Ming-Liang, 1992) 7.5

The first thing I've seen from this director and it's a very solid start. A compelling film about youth and urban alienation, although unlike Yang's ABSD it has only a very small cast and is set in the present day. The camera here often lingers slightly after a shot, allowing the oppressive heat and pervasive hopelessness to set in. It drives the frustrations of its young residents, and soon enough they're out at night looking for an outlet or any kind of escape.

**To Sleep With Anger** (Burnett, 1990) 6.5

Great Danny Glover performance as an 'old friend' of an LA family who turns up unexpectedly and overstays his welcome. Without really doing too much he sows a lot of disharmony and quickly builds into a devil-like character. Despite a low budget it works overall, though I just found it a bit slow in building the suspense.

**The Mother and the Whore** (Eustache, 1973) 8

This must be one of the talkiest movies of all-time. Luckily I'm into that. Unfortunately the subtitles I had didn't seem very good, but I think I got the gist. I've never liked Leaud much as an actor, but I think this film got the best out of him as a dilettante chauvinist who flip-flops between two girls. They philosophize endlessly in Parisian Cafes and sleep around in unadorned apartments (as French people are apparently want to do) until eventually things naturally fall apart.

**Strokes of Genius** (Douglas, 2018) 7

A documentary about the Federer-Nadal rivalry, but mainly their epic final at Wimbledon '08, often rated as the best match of all-time. In general it's a fine account of the match, its significance, and the similarities and differences between Rafa and Roger. And it has interviews from both players, plus coaches, trainers, the umpire, commentators and other key people. A good one for tennis or sports fans, although I personally would've liked some technical analysis of the match tactics, just to go with all the drama.

**The Emigrants** (Troell, 1971) / **The New Land** (Troell, 1972) 8.5

These really are two great epics of the 70s - or one mammoth 6.5hr achievement if you were to watch them back to back. The story is straightforward and universal, although with a lot of feeling for these characters and their years of struggling. Two beautiful looking films that really make use of natural light and take you back to another time and place.

**Art School Confidential** (Zwigoff, 2006) [rewatch] 7.5

A very funny art school, art industry satire from Terry Zwigoff which just goes off track a bit in the 2nd half."
1728,2020-05-03 14:06:50,gcon2v,"High Plains Drifter - 8.5/10

Starship Troopers - 8/10

Mortal Kombat - guilty pleasure, everything down to the effects seem appropriate. I didn't know it tested badly at first so they went back and  filmed the fight scenes with Scorpion and Reptile, 6.5/10"
1729,2020-05-03 15:10:42,gcon2v,"Cheers Rom!  (I already know what you’re going to say about one of my ratings haha)

**Offering (1978), short** - 7/10

**Father and Daughter (2000), short** - 8/10

**Borrowed Time (2015)**,short REWATCH - 9/10

[Alien (1979) REWATCH - 8/10 (went down from a 9)](https://boxd.it/17glQb) 

**Sucker Punch (2011)** - 1/10 I really hated this.

[Necromancy (1972) - 7/10](https://boxd.it/17mtd9) 

[Aliens (1986) REWATCH - 8/10](https://boxd.it/17nDXj) 

**Code 8 (2019)** - 5/10

**Daybreakers (2009)** - 7/10 super creative and really well thought out.  I prefer the other Spierig/Hawke film **Predestination**.

**Unplanned (2019)** - 6/10

**Upload (2020)** First Season - 8/10 from director-writer Greg Daniels of **The Office** fame comes a nice light (occasionally heavy) show about human consciousness being uploaded into an AI plane.  It’s basically like a funnier version of a Black Mirror episode."
1730,2020-05-03 20:27:14,gcon2v,"(1 of 2)

**Festen (Thomas Vinterberg, 1998)** 7/10

I went into this expecting a bitter black comedy about a dysfunctional family, which is how it starts, but it soon develops into a heavier study of complicity and the legacy of abuse, and ends up more cathartic, less nihilistic, and warmer than I would have imagined, almost incongruously so. It's the first Dogme 95 film, with a rough, grungy look that anticipates the digital age (digital pioneer Anthony Dod Mantle dp'd) and gives the film a home-video found-footage vibe in its more intimate, less expressionistic moments. Not too much to say about it, but I found it both entertaining and powerful.

**1900 (Bernardo Bertolucci, 1976)** 5/10

Another long one, this time an epic following two friends born on the same day, a landowner and a peasant, in Emilia-Romagna during the first half of the 20th century, as the Italian oligarchy gives way to the opposing tides of socialism and fascism. The broad swath of the story follows a fairly predictable set of beats, though it's hard to figure why it skips over big chunks of history and lingers in so many unexpected and unsettling corners, often to explore its bizarrely persistent penis fixation. A number of odd, disturbing characters pepper the landscape, including Burt Lancaster's impotent would-be molester patriarch and Donald Sutherland's fascist foreman, who for a start head-butts a cat to death. When we're not getting a bunch of sensational extraneous specifics, many of the wide cast of characters feel underdeveloped and broad. Their dialogue frequently veers into bombastic clunkiness, to the extent that it's hard to imagine how some of these lines made it past the brainstorming phase. The English translation may be responsible for some of it, and I can't remember seeing such distractingly disjointed dubbing before: De Niro speaks with a New York accent, Depardieu with a French one, and the English dubbing of Italian actors is wildly out of sync. The cinematography is probably the most interesting aspect of the film. The first section, set after the turn of the century, is shot in blazing daylight, which looks blown out, or in the golden hour, which gives everything a sickly red hue and jaundices the skin tones -- the intention seems to be to convey a sense of pastoral nostalgia (old-school actors, Lancaster and Sterling Hayden, also dominate this section), but whatever film stock or color process was used at the time is not flattering to this approach. Once the film moves onto the adult years of the two friends, almost everything is shot on overcast, foggy days with a more muted palate to match its more cosmopolitan setting, and most of this looks fantastic. It takes on an increasingly colder, diffused look as time goes on, culminating in borderline grayscale to mirror the darkest days of fascism. The last bit, set post-Liberation, returns to the earlier, warmer tones, with a correspondingly (and surprisingly) sentimental resolution.

I've heard ""bloated"" used to describe movies before, but at 5 plus hours, this was the first time I can remember it really coming to mind for me, with the attention to subplots and tangents at the expense of more relevant story details distracting from the world-building instead of contributing to it. I tend to be easy to please when it comes to sweeping historical melodrama, but this is both too ambitious and too narrow, lacking the scope and insight that draws me to that subgenre. It's an interesting mess, but mostly valuable as a curio.

**The Pillow Book (Peter Greenaway, 1996)** 4/10

Say what you will about Greenaway, he did push things to the limit, and the kitchen sink aesthetic here was initially refreshing after watching so many looong dedications to one stylistic approach. Unfortunately once I got used to it I found it more tiresome than anything else, too adept and deliberate to feel gimmicky, but not gripping enough to elevate the scant story. I don't want to open the style/substance can of worms, but it often feels like Greenaway's using his bag of tricks to obscure a paucity of meaning.

**Scenes from a Marriage (Ingmar Bergman, 1974)** 9/10

""Remaining content requires a certain technique. You need to put a lot of effort into not caring.""

I watched the miniseries version of this, slightly afraid I'd feel burnt out after a run of long movies, but it's truly bingeable. From the start, it uses the relationship drama structure to explore the human experience of modern reality and the various ways we interpret and interact with it. It's Bergman operating at his most human while retaining his metaphysical allure, reminiscent in its talkiness and philosophical bent of my favorite of his, Winter Light, but more grounded in lived experience. The compositions are immaculate, especially the close-ups, but they only work so well because of the strength of the actors. Liv Ullman seems descended from another realm: every expression and intonation is a work of art, even giving such excessively Bergmanesque lines as ""sometimes all you get is the vast silence of outer space"" a natural and slyly ironic read. Erland Josephson's beady-eyed strengths also emerge as his character's strengths recede, gradually revealing the vulnerabilities behind a stoic facade. It's a testament to the subtlety and vividness of the direction and acting that I could relate to these characters on a gut level despite sharing so few of their fundamental problems (I understand their sense of emptiness and confusion about the world, but I can't (yet?) empathize with their angst related to repression and conformity). Reinforcing the sense of hidden depths, Sven Nykvist plies his supernatural finesse to render the ordinary interior settings masterpieces of light, color, and texture in a grainy, painterly mode (I'm guessing this was shot on 16mm). I can't think of any cinematographer who was able to bring so much beauty out of and to the commonplace, and getting to the nature shot at the end of each episode was almost as incentivizing to watch another as the story itself. Off the top of my head, this is my favorite thing of its kind; I'm eager to explore the Fanny and Alexander miniseries soon."
1731,2020-05-04 04:21:14,gcon2v,"Hello! I hope everyone is doing great!

Now I am even more excited about **American woman**. **Radioactive** is also on my watchlist, mainly because I like Rosamund Pike so much, kind of sad to hear you didn't enjoy it... and you don't seem to be the only one from what IMDb shows.

**Wendy** sound very interesting, I am always on board for a good retelling. Added! :)

Slow week for me.

* ***Watchlist currently at: 1337 movies***

[**Stoker**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1682180/?ref_=rt_li_tt) **(2013) - 7.5/10.** *Rewatched.* ***Synopsis:*** *After India's father dies, her Uncle Charlie, whom she never knew  existed, comes to live with her and her unstable mother. She comes to suspect this mysterious, charming man has ulterior motives and becomes increasingly infatuated with him.*

I liked this movie a lot more the first time I watched it, but I was slightly dissapointed by how blunt and obvious some of the character's intentions were. However, once I understood this movie is about India's journey, instead of Charlie's mysterious past, I came to enjoy it more. I still feel a bit conflicted about some of the actions near the end of a moive... but still think is great-

I love some f- up family drama. It's over the top, but I loved the style. Such an strange vibe. The directing was superb, the use of sound was incredible, and as disurbing as it must be, it is a stunning movie. It's hard to stop thinking about it after.

[**Annabelle Comes Home**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8350360/?ref_=rt_li_tt) **(2019) - 5/10.** *From my watchlist.* ***Synopsis:*** *While babysitting the daughter of Ed and Lorraine Warren, a teenager and her friend unknowingly awaken an evil spirit trapped in a doll.*

Another installment in the Conjuring universe that fails to fulfill my expectations. There is some cool mythology and some good horror sequences... but it's just not interesting. I wish there was more of Ed and Lorraine Warren because I think their characters keep the saga alive. 

[**The Signal**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2910814/?ref_=rt_li_tt) **(2014) - 6/10.** *From my watchlist.* ***Synopsis:***  *On a road trip, Nic and two friends are drawn to an isolated area by a computer genius. When everything suddenly goes dark, Nic regains  consciousness - only to find himself in a waking nightmare*

Low-budget sci-fi with some great suspense and very creepy moments. I loved the mystery of the first third of the movie, then it changed the tone and got a bit repetitive, but nonetheless enjoyable. The ending is usually the dealbreaker on this type of stories, and I feel a bit conflicted about it. I like the idea presented a lot, but my instict reaction was ""NO WAY""... because it invalidates a bit the relationships of the film and some of the character's journey. 

William Eubank also did Underwater, Kirsten Stewart's movie that came out this year... I was quite curious about it. now even more. 

[**Hesher**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1403177/?ref_=rt_li_tt) **(2010) - 5/10.** *Random pick.* ***Synopsis:***  *A young boy has lost his mother and is losing touch with his father and  the world around him. Then he meets Hesher who manages to make his life  even more chaotic.*

Some people love this movie, I guess it just wasn't for me. First I actually thought this was going to be some sort of Fight Club situation and was very intrigued by that, and I enjoyed the over the top nature of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character. It gave me Spring Breakers vibe, a movie I think is a bit misunderstood and I had had to fight tooth and nail for, a sort of extreme that reads satirical... but after a while I just got tired of it, especially when it got more soppy. The best part: a really good performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, quite different from what he ususally does. 

I just didn't see the point or the depth other people percieved. 2/3 into the movie I just stopped being shocked or amazed by the characters actions and started to wonder *what is the point of this?... Again, this wasn't the movie for me.* 

[**The Diving Bell and the Butterfly**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401383/?ref_=rt_li_tt) **(2007) - 7.5/10.** *From my watchlist.* ***Synopsis:***  *The true story of Elle editor* *Jean-Dominique Bauby* *who suffers a stroke and has to live with an almost totally paralyzed body; only his left eye isn't paralyzed.*

Beautiful movie, with a very original way of telling the story and good performances. It's so perfectly filmed that it puts you inside Bauby's head and body, and it keeps you there throughout the entire movie ... it's truly a cinematic experience. I understand why is held in so high regard and is so beloved. Unfortunately, just as the movie knew how to be deep and thoughtful, sometimes it also became a little slow and repetitive... And being honest, I cared very little about his love affairs and opinions about the women around him, I was more interested in his personal struggle and intention to write, I kind of disconnected in those parts (which are quite a few).

***Extra***

[**National Theatre Live: Frankenstein**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1795369/?ref_=rt_li_tt) **(2011) - 8/10.** *Random pick.* ***Synopsis:***  *Created by Victor Frankenstein, the one known only as the creature sets out to discover the world and the meaning of life.*

When I saw they were going to show this play on Youtube I knew I HAD to watch it. I know it's not a movie but I write it here to recommend it, both versions of the play [Frankenstein with Benedict Cumberbatch as the creature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl8jxNrtceQ) (which is the one I saw, and the one most people recommend) and  [Frankenstein with Jonny Lee Miller as the creature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI88grIRAnY) are now available on Youtube for free. I'm pretty sure next week they are going to upload Antony & Cleopatra with Ralph Fiennes as the protagonist.

It is an amazing production with some great performances, I would have loved to see it live if I had had the chance- I have read that it takes some divergences from the original story (a book I still have to read) which made some people mad, but as a viewer I thought the story adn feeling were captured perfectly with the characters they had, and the storylines they chose.

Stay safe!"
1732,2020-05-04 18:47:51,gcon2v,"Saw very little this week, have a big essay coming up and a lot of reading. From worst to best:

**War Babies** (1932, Charles Lamont): 6/10. This short kind of reminded me of *Freaks.* It is very strange, the humor is weird (it is supposed to be a comedy) and some references are just overtly sexual or inappropriate and have aged terribly. This was the debut movie of famed child actress Shirley Temple, by the way.

**Repulsion** (1965, Roman Polanski): 8-/10. Carol, played by the amazing Catherine Deneuve, is a hallucinating, sex-deprived, traumatized woman who encounters many strange things in what she perceives as a chaotic and nightmarish world. What is real and what is not? You'll have to see it to find out. Great psychological thriller from Roman Polanski (and very unsettling that a man convicted for raping a 13 year old made this movie)."

What a messy, silly fucking movie.  I'm *almost* curious if the source material was a fucking nonsensical as this film.  Almost.  

**Under the Silver Lake** This was pretty interesting.  I still don't quite know what to make of it.  I wish I had seen it before the recent ""noir"" thread that appeared here, because I think this is relevant.  While obviously not a straight-up noir, it definitely has some elements of that.  It's often hard to get into films where the protagonist is not likable and that's certainly the case here, and I'm still not sure what the fuck this film was even *about* but there was something compelling about it and it manages to even be moving at times.  I think it also intends to be a puzzle of sorts in its own right - I noticed that there's a lot going on with symbols and cryptic writing that isn't directly called attention to (cyphers on one of the character's shelves, on the bathroom stall wall, etc).  The obvious point of comparison here is Donnie Darko, so if you're a fan of that, this will probably appeal to you."

First of all the girl here hasn't been a victim of bullying her entire life, nor is her home life ruled by a religious fanatic mother who sees her own daughter as a witch fit to be burned. The injustice against her is just stuff seen in Hallmark level movies, not a horror film and certainly not a sequel to Carrie. Consequently her blowup seems ridiculously out of proportion.

1740,2020-05-03 15:00:21,gcon2v,"Hey, Lucan!  I tagged you in last week’s post but had no idea you blocked Hurdy’s stuff (at least that’s what he told me).  Anyway, I tagged you in last week’s viewings post because I finally got around to both *Tideland* and *The Man Who Killed Don Quixote*.  So I only have *Jabberwocky*, *Bandits*, and *Baron* left and I believe that includes all his shorts too.  

Tideland - 8/10

Quixote - 9/10

Huge fan of Gilliam overall.  His weakest work IMO is *Fear and Loathing*.  I was expecting *Tideland* to be worse based on most reviews and ratings.  In reality, it’s one of those films most people dislike because it covers certain topics like addiction in a very fucked up way.  It’s easily one of those great films I may never actively want to watch again.  

Quixote is no way perfect, but I love Gilliam’s take on comedy and absurdity and it makes the whole adventure super enjoyable.  Driver and Pryce are a comedic team for the ages. 

Anyway—thought you’d be interested in hearing that. 

Nice write-ups!  **The Dark Past** sounds neat.  I added it to my watchlist.  

Cheers"

1746,2020-05-03 20:27:24,gcon2v,"(2 of 2)

**A Zed & Two Noughts (Peter Greenaway, 1985)** 7/10

This contains the most boldly impressive compositions I've seen from Greenaway yet; zoos are evocative spaces and I don't think I've seen a film set in one before. Greenaway seems to have a very specific set of interests and sensibilities, which align perfectly with mine in some ways and not at all in others -- I'm still not crazy about his self-consciously clever writing, which works worse here than in a historical context a la Draughtsman's Contract. Some of these preoccupations he shares with Thomas Pynchon -- eccentrics, sex, conspiracies, death, scientific minutiae, body enhancement, lists -- and much as with that author of some of my favorite books I've learned not to give too much weight to every little detail for fear they'll fail to cohere satisfyingly. With this mindset I was able to just kick back and enjoy the experience. I also appreciate Nyman's music more the more I hear it.

**Triumph of the Will (Leni Riefenstahl, 1935)**

Riefenstahl demonstrates an intuitive mastery of the cinematographic image, a poetic eye for form and movement matched with the boundless scope of her subject, directing from an editorial standpoint to maintain a constancy of stunning variety. I hate to say it but if I was able to detach myself from history and just judge it on aesthetic standards as the depiction of some grand occult ritual I'd have to give it a perfect score. It's crazy how harmless it can feel in its quieter moments if you let your guard down. The speechifying really raised my blood pressure though. I kind of wish I'd seen this when I was younger and less sensitive to this sort of thing.

**Stranger by the Lake (Alain Guiraudie, 2013)** 7/10

Sex and death always make an intriguing combination -- this is like the gay Twentynine Palms. Guiraudie initially seemed too self-conscious with his compositions, but I think I just had to get used to the style. His vivid sense of place was the biggest selling point for me. I found the resolution oddly pat, but liked the ending itself.

**The Death of Mr. Lazarescu (Christi Puiu, 2005)** 7/10

An immersive nighttime odyssey that nonetheless left me a little cold. It has that emblematic Eastern European art movie thing going on where it's composed of a bunch of long takes with not much going on per se at any given moment, but it's still gripping and goes by quickly. It's hard for me to gauge what specific interests lie behind Puiu's brand of claustrophobic realism: human nature, broken systems, maybe world building? The lingering long takes signify a deep love of character, using the dysfunctional system around a man desperately seeking medical care to study different aspects of human nature. The broad spectrum of personalities and behavioral tendencies on display reflect a barely positive overall outlook on humankind, which makes the inevitable failings of their socioeconomic structure as a whole all the more poignant. The dry humor would probably have come across better in a theater setting; as it was I more recognized than enjoyed it. There's also some stuff, like having the protagonist's middle name be Dante and his brother-in-law be Virgil, for instance, that just feels like vague spoon-feeding. Sometimes I felt like it should be a favorite, but it didn't quite hit me like that.

**Dog Soldiers (Neil Marshall, 2002)** 6/10

Watched this with half an eye with my girlfriend, and I was pleasantly surprised. The Zabriskie Point line was the highlight for me.

**Un flic (Jean-Pierre Melville, 1972)** 6/10

A cop-and-robber story stripped down to almost Bressonian fundaments. Other than some all-time dolly shots, funky architecture, and other visually slick shit, though, I found it hard to get involved. The interminable train heist in the middle especially throws off the rhythm without offering anything more impressive than a contemporary Bond flick, with more hair-combing. Still, hard not to enjoy if only aesthetically -- those icy blue hues look great on 70s French film stock. I appreciated the little touches like a quick stare-off with a Van Gogh self-portrait."

1756,2020-05-03 15:13:45,gcon2v,"I'm a fan of Gilliam as well, but not quite a ""huge fan"". Unfortunately I haven't much liked any of his 21st Century work at all. Quixote did come close to being a good film but unfortunately it fell short. I like his earlier work much more. Either way I have to respect the man's artistic vision and admit that all of his films certainly have a personality about them.

If you like films about the occult and appreciate the late 60/early 70s aesthetic you will definitely like *Necromancy*.  It’s definitely campy, but it proves to be worth the time IMO.  Be careful to not watch the edited version that goes by “The Witching”.  I haven’t seen that version but people say it is a re-edited mess.

Yeah Code 8 is serviceable.  I like how the introduced the world and powers.  After watching this and *Upload* I realized Robbie Amell is vastly misused in *Code 8* and is way better in a lead romantic/comedic role like in *Upload*."

Yeah I know **Unplanned** gets a bad rap and I know it also handles a highly polarized political issue, but it gets points in my book for telling a side of that issue without getting too much into hyperbole.  Acting aside, it is made decently from a film perspective.  I know it is labeled as propaganda and I would never press my own opinion on the subject unless asked for it.  

I just watched a Japanese Propaganda film from Kurosawa the other day **The Most Beautiful** which I didn’t necessarily agree with but also gave a 6/10 for being ok as a film.

I probably rate **Parnassus** higher than most, but when I first saw it in theaters it turned from “what the hell?” to “holy shit”.  It’s the first time ever (I can recall) where an actor’s untimely death actually made the film better (and honestly a more thought provoking feature).  It was a great experience.  And I’m of the opinion of the majority that **Brazil** is his masterpiece.

What you asserted is scriptural is only inferred because JS only talked about men getting the priesthood in the Biblical narrative.  No mention is made whatsoever about the topic at hand - women getting the priesthood.   

>  it is only passed from father to son 

That isn't true.  There are plenty of modern and biblical examples of priesthood being conferred by one person to another with no family relation.  However, granted the examples tend to be male to male.  I would ask what the social status of women was in biblical times? Is Old Testament treatment of women the pattern we wish to emulate?

>  im confident Joseph Smith would have made it clear 

Do you apply this generally?  If JS didn't specifically say something can happen, then the answer is it can't?  Of course no one would apply this argument consistently because the Church has made many additions to what JS said or filled in many gaps of things he did not clearly state.  This is selectively (and inconsistently) applying an argument to fit the narrative where it is convenient.

In fact, the LDS Church shows inconsistency with regard to its own history and the bible on who God allows to have the priesthood.   Does only the tribe of Levi have the priesthood today?  Are black men allowed the priesthood today? It changes.  There is more precedent in the LDS Church for God changing from the Old Testament pattern than to follow it.  

> Elder Oaks made it clear that despite pleadings from Kate Kelly and Ordain Women, it would not be right for the apostles and first presidency to pray for something that isn't in the pattern laid out by God. 

The Church leaders 70 years ago said the same things about Black people and the priesthood.  They made it very clear despite pleadings from LDS people who saw the error in the LDS treatment of Black people.  Same argument, different demographic.  LDS Church leaders have a long history of teaching their prejudices/opinions as God's will.   Oaks is just the Mark E. Petersen of 2020.

My father didn't give it to me, but another man did.  The point was that it goes from male to male, not from male to female as the general pattern in the scriptures.  I don't follow the Old Testament, I follow the New Testament law, that's the one we should emulate, not the Old Testament. 

I don't see how the church can change now after what has been said by modern prophets and based on the pattern in scriptures. It's not impossible, but it will be an even bigger backflip than the priesthood being conferred upon blacks was.  It's up there with backflipping on marriage changing if that were to happen.  

I don't think it's likely women will get the priesthood, I don't think it's productive to the more important work of sharing the Gospel but in our current political and social climate I understand why it is an issue now for so many people.

However, I think it is disingenuous to state that it is against the scriptures when in reality it isn't addressed in the scriptures.  The issue is open.  Unfortunately, those in our religion who claim to speak for God have a pretty poor track record of flip-flopping on what God says.  

As far as which is a bigger backflip, I think that is open to discussion.  It wasn't just Black people having the priesthood, it was allowing them into heaven period.  Mormon prophets actually taught that God won't let a significant portion of his children to return to him.  They used scripture as the foundation of that teaching.  The reason to bring this up is because it shows how significantly wrong Mormon prophets can be and their willingness to teach their philosophies of men mingled with scripture.  So it is reasonable for anyone to hear what a current prophet is saying and believe they are wrong.

In summary, given that

(A) Women having the priesthood is not addressed in the scriptures

(B) Mormon prophets make significant doctrinal mistakes

It is a reasonable position to believe that women may have the priesthood."

Sidney Rigdon wrote that ""Emma Smith was the one to whom the female priesthood was first given."" plus the first people to be bestowed with the fullness of the priesthood were Joseph and Emma together, and so Emma was ordained as such.

 Sure, some Mormons do this. And it's wrong. But it's not what our doctrine does. Have you ever taken a look at our scriptures? We proclaim Christ as the divine eternal God even more explicitly than the bible does. Plus the bible is scripture and proclaims him as God.


Why are we called Mormons? Because of our belief in the Book of Mormon. What does the Book of Mormon say on its very first page? That it's purpose is to convince people Christ is God. Not to mention we have an entire book of Jesus proclaiming himself as God"

I have not said you’re wrong. I have not challenged your faith. I’ve not even presented my own view point. I’ve not yelled or gotten angry. I’m genuinely asking because I’d like to know why you believe this, that’s literally it.

If this is a segue to arguing they don't subscribe to your particular brand of trinitarianism, don't bother. That's an orthodoxy debate. We already agree they're not orthodox. But they are Christian."
1910,2020-05-03 17:19:27,gcl092,"Wrong. It's been a thing since the beginning. 

The title page of the Book of Mormon says: ""And also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations.""

The Book of Mosiah in the BoM states:

 ""For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all eternity to all eternity, shall come down from heaven among the children of men, and shall dwell in a tabernacle of clay, and shall go forth amongst men, working mighty miracles, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, causing the lame to walk, the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and curing all manner of diseases.
		
 And he shall cast out devils, or the evil spirits which dwell in the hearts of the children of men.
			
And lo, he shall suffer temptations, and pain of body, hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it be unto death; for behold, blood cometh from every pore, so great shall be his anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his people.
		
 And he shall be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning; and his mother shall be called Mary.""

 This is not even 1% of it I could go on and on. I would try more than looking at the Book.

For your whole Jehovah point, again, not even 1%, but here. 

in The Book of D&C Joseph wrote:

 ""The veil was taken from our minds, and the eyes of our understanding were opened. We saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit, before us; and under his feet was a paved work of pure gold, in color like amber.

His eyes were as a flame of fire; the hair of his head was white like the pure snow; his countenance shone above the brightness of the sun; and his voice was as the sound of the rushing of great waters, even the voice of Jehovah, saying:

I am the first and the last; I am he who liveth, I am he who was slain; I am your advocate with the Father.”"""

1916,2020-05-03 17:12:18,gcl092,"Wrong. Mormonism states explicitly that Jesus is Jehovah. Both our leaders and scriptures do so.

See my previous comment on how he is God to us. 

By the way, our scriptures are also even more Trinitarian than the bible even is."
1917,2020-05-03 17:32:49,gcl092,"Wrote the answer on the other post. And anyways they are both God, not separate beings. In the official recount they are the same being but have different bodies sure but that's also what actual nicene and biblical Trinitarianism claims. I won't say we're modalists, but no mainstream Christians are and it is a heresy."

1921,2020-05-03 17:23:51,gcl092,"Yep. Again, Our scriptures make this clear. He is Elohim, he is Jehovah, he is YHWH the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob, etc.

Now for simplicity many Mormons refer to him as Jehovah and the father as Elohim as names, but this is just a formality they take to make it clear which they refer to. I don't agree with this, but it's what they do. However as far as actual doctrine and scripture goes, Christ is Elohim, and during Joseph's ministry the distinction was not made."
1922,2020-05-03 22:01:43,gcl092,FYI John phantom hive has extremely unorthodox views. What he says about the trinity is not close to what any average Mormon believes and would probably be received very poorly in a Sunday School class.
1923,2020-05-03 18:22:17,gcl092,"Because unfortunately the church's teaching patterns in meetings, conference, publications, culture and the like change a lot and are often erroneous(as was taught would be the case). Many of the teachers also greatly misunderstood concepts, and few ever fact check what they're taught. 

Even outside of our own doctrine This extends. Many Mormons in an attempt to deny it have a false understanding and teaching of what Trinitarianism and the Nicene creed are and are just arguing against a heresy that mainline Christians also condemn. And then accidentally slip into a polytheistic worldview the scriptures condemned.

This is why it is important to place ones faith in Christ and in the holy scriptures rather than the teachings of men. 

from the very first page, Our scriptures body proclaim one triune God, and the absolute divinity and eternal nature of Christ. It also proclaims he is our Father and king, rather than our brother. This is the only binding doctrine."
1924,2020-05-03 17:24:46,gcl092,So why is he separate from god in Josephs first vision?
1925,2020-05-03 23:15:53,gcl092,He should just convert to Orthodoxy with his teachings
1926,2020-05-04 01:30:09,gcl092,"Which is basically what I said. Sure, it's not what the average Mormon believes. However he is making generalizations and speaking of doctrine.  My belief here is only what the scriptures (source of doctrine) say."
1927,2020-05-03 17:31:28,gcl092,"First things first, if we're going to be really shallow about it and treat Trinitarianism and the divinity of Christ through the strawman version most Mormons set up;

In the actual first vision account written by Joseph Smith's own hand, there is no such separation. 


As far as the official account goes, it follows Trinitarianism more than you think, it's just not modalism. Trinitarianism teaches that God is three persons, but one God. These personages are separate anyways in Christianity; the Father is a being of spirit, but the Son is the one who descended to earth and took up a body and prayed to his father. I

They are one God and share one divine essence and mind, but as the bible even teaches that doesn't need entail one form they're both conjoined in. That's modalistic heresy."

Every version of the bible has unique errors in it and that the BOM contains verses from the bible containing errors from the 1769 version of the KJV that JS family owned, along with all the extra KJV words that were added in the 1600's. 

Benjamin K Paddock wrote about a revival in 1826 1 mile from Palmyra 15 months before translation began on the BOM that bears an embarrassing resemblance to King Benjamins speech. 

 JS Snr had the Tree of Life dream (yep the same one Lehi had) in 1811. 

The parts of Isaiah that are in the BOM were written after Lehis family left Jerusalem...which makes them impossible to be in the BOM. 

The BOM was heavily plagiarized from 3 other books (View of the Hebrews/The Late war between the United States and Great Britain and The First Book of Napoleon)

The View of The Hebrews was written by Oliver Cowderys pastor.

At least one of these books was found using plagiarism software (the type they use in college), which compared the Book of Mormon to 110000 other books published before the book of Mormon.

GA Elder BH Roberts researched the similarities between the View of the Hebrews and the BOM around the 1920s for the first presidency and wrote them a report saying ' “Did Ethan Smith’s View of the Hebrews furnish structural material for Joseph Smith’s Book of Mormon? It has been pointed out in these pages that there are many things in the former book that might well have suggested many major things in the other. Not a few things merely, one or two, or a half dozen, but many; and **it is this fact of many things of similarity and the cumulative force of them that makes them so serious a menace to Joseph Smith’s story of the Book of Mormon’s origin**.” '

DNA evidence has concluded that the native american Indians come from Asia not at all from the middle east. 

The BOM contains tons of anachronisms that did not exist on the American continent before columbus like horses, cattle, oxen, sheep, swine, goats, elephants, wheels, chariots, wheat, silk, steel, and iron.

There is absolutely no archaeological evidence to support the BOM claims. There are even BYU professors saying ' *...you can’t set Book of Mormon geography down anywhere – because it is fictional and will never meet the requirements of the dirt-archaeology. I should say – what is in the ground will never conform to what is in the book.*

Unfortunately there is not just one source that contains all the info you are looking for. [https://cesletter.org/](https://cesletter.org/) is a good place to start. Jeremy Runnells did an excellent job of covering most issues TBM's believe in and the LDS church did try to defend itself by writing the Church Essays. [Mormon Essays](https://mormonessays.com/) does a great job of listing all the essays and makes it easy to read only the topics you are interested in. The church had to make some kind of rebuttal to the CES Letter because there were too many members being ""led astray"" by Jeremy's honest writings and research. Jeremy has also done an excellent job of rebutting the church's rebuttals. 

There are many more sources (some popular, some not) that also do an excellent job of proving everything said above. A good one that comes to mind is [http://www.utlm.org/](http://www.utlm.org/) and you can sign up for a free newsletter from them that always covers very controversial topics. There are also many books written that are worth reading, but it would take a huge amount of time to make a dent in even the good ones. Maybe stay-at-home time is a good time to start. The book I read that did an excellent job in proving how Joseph Smith plagiarized the Book of Mormon is No Man Knows My History by Fawn M. Brodie.

Anderson won't make the tour via injury or retirement.  If he does I don't expect wonders

Mo will play the first test. None thereafter

Mitch Marsh will make a ton

4 or 5 nil. I don't see England putting out a pace attack that's good enough 5 tests in a row.

Captains will be Paine and Root.

Mitch Starc grows a mustache in an attempt to emulate Mitch Johnson. Pat Cummins does a knee in an attempt to emulate Ryan Harris.

**Outlandish Predicitons**

After significant loss and injury, the ECB draft in ~~Tony Greig~~ Nasser Hussain and Mark Nicholas, as well as Graham Gooch, with little success.

Root is deposed as captain, replaced by Andy Balbirnie, because Irish captains have done wonders for England in other formats.

England start to think that playing Wood, Archer and Stokes as their only pacers is a good idea.

Mo opens with Burns in the first innings, and number 11 in the second. 

Alex Doolan Steve Bradburys his way to the captaincy after the entire XI get done for ball tampering.

**ENG Top Wickets:** Stuart Broad

**RESULT:** Australia 5-0

Smith is an absolute Ashes legend. I mean he's the literal GOAT anyway against everyone but like he really saves his masterpieces for England.

Broad also delivers his very best against Australia.

I think Paine will hopefully at least go on until the end of the Ashes, if not longer. He'll go until the WTC final at the very least I think, but I'd like to see him stay on even longer than that. Not just because I have always really really liked him and he's my favourite player, but because if he finished at the WTC Final, then the first Ashes test would be the first test under the new captain. (I guess that would be less of an issue if it were Smith)

I also predict England's keeper won't be Bairstow or Buttler."

* David Warner takes 3 rippers at slip.
* Chris Silverwood kicks a trash can.
* Matthew Wade takes 3 wickets.
* Joe Root gets Smudger out for 144 after the latter tries to reverse sweep him for shits and giggles.
* Watto commentates for Channel 7 and him and Ponting are now the dream team.
* Jimmy shocks everyone by not retiring.
* Leach gets cartered and dropped for Bess who gets smashed.
* Mark Ealham watches the cricket.
* Joe Burns gets a haircut.
* Denners becomes the most loved cricketer in the world, surpassing Kohli.
* Shane Warne gets all grumpy when Nathan Lyon takes a better hat trick than him, and then wants Gazza dropped for Swepson.
* Shane Warne bags out Steve Waugh 5 times during the series and praises Mark Waugh 82 times.
* Ian Healy does a session with Bairstow and Buttler and goes to cry after realising that both are beyond hope.
* Graeme Hick laughs at Graham Thorpe after England collapses again and loses the Ashes."

2032,2020-05-03 17:39:40,gcgoqg,"Two little adjustments: Donovan is not in the prologue, he joined the cast later, the VIP is played by Jefferson Hall. IMDb doesn't list Tenet as one of his works, but he was spotted on day 1 of shootings.Kapadia's husband is played by Denzil Smith, Patel would be way too young. I'm not saying they're not connected, but not in that way.One little extra info: it is 99% that the guy who saves JDW in the prologue is Pattinson, an extra from the set confirmed it.I think Poesy will be the equivalent of Bond's Q. And it's unlikely that JDW will be an actual firefighter, but he will impersonate one."
2033,2020-05-03 14:56:05,gcgoqg,I think I saw a description somewhere that said Patel is Kapadia's husband or boyfriend and is an illegal weapons dealer.
2034,2020-05-04 05:52:58,gcgoqg,Exactly. I doubt JD is an actual firefighter. It wouldn't make sense for him to be an ex-firefighter especially when the main sequence in Estonia has him dressed as a firefighter to retrieve the orange briefcase.
2035,2020-05-04 11:22:28,gcgoqg,"I'm still confused about the rumour of Pattinson being the SWAT member in the Prologue who saves JDW. At the end of the trailer Pattinson says "" What the hell happened here"" to which JDW replies "" It hasn't happened yet"". So the question is, if Pattinson is the SWAT member in a scene that presumably is at the start of the film. Why is he acting so shocked in the bullet in the glass scene. 

To me it doesn't make sense for Pattinson to be the SWAT member"
2036,2020-05-04 13:25:20,gcgoqg,"IMHO, the character who saves JDW from being shot would be played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson.  His face is never seen (except in promotional materials). Based on the images I've seen, he is definitely an agent. Out of all the ten characters, only JDW, RP and ATJ are looking east, while the remaining seven are looking west, including the antagonist Kenneth Branagh.  I'm sure this was done intentionally, though it is subtle to an extent."
2037,2020-05-04 11:32:25,gcgoqg,"No, Denzil Smith is Kapadia's husband who is an arms dealer i guess. I guess Patel is maybe a messenger of sorts from the leaked scenes and pics."
2038,2020-05-04 12:30:06,gcgoqg,"I don't see the problem with that. He is not confused because of the time-reversing, they were simply not expecting to enter a room with fresh bullet holes, and maybe it will be a surprise to them that the room has a machine. I think there will be more time between the two sentences (What happened|Hasn't happened), and JDW analyses the scene, maybe he will see something moving unnatural, that's why he finds out the trick sooner."
2039,2020-05-04 14:06:41,gcgoqg,"Maybe I missed something, but there are no promotional materials except for the trailer and the only one poster (with JDW cut in half)"

2050,2020-05-03 22:09:27,gcesz4,"I would argue that the Architect neither won nor lost. The Architect is willing to accept either outcome. Option A - the One complies, Zion is destroyed and the Matrix reloads or option B - the One does not comply, Zion is destroyed and the Matrix crashes. He did all he could to produce the preferred ""choice"", option A.

He did not anticipate that Neo would find a way to create an option 'C' out of thin air.

Neo changed the entire paradigm, which is what the Oracle wanted. So I would say that the Oracle ""won"" as well as all the humans in Zion who, thanks to Neo, were NOT obliterated.

But the efforts to wake people did not die with Neo. They continued in the Matrix Online as u/vesuveusmxo already pointed out. The Architect's ""power"" is limited because he cannot prevent the systemic anomaly.

>and there was a large swath of those who were conscious to experience the Smith virus and his showdown with Neo, and the Architect agreed to let them free

I'm fairly certain that reload cleaned a lot of this mess up. I never played the Matrix Online, but the Matrix is stable. Perhaps  could confirm here but I'm certain that most plugged-in humans were restored to a state of ignorance about the true nature of their reality. The ""ones who want out"" will ostensibly be allowed to leave peacefully, with the help of Zion. But I don't think there is widespread awareness among the humans of their true condition."
2051,2020-05-02 23:50:24,gcesz4,"Yea I mean either of those are entirely possible. Either the Architect still fails to create the perfect system and the spawn of the new Neo rises, or the data used from ""our"" Neo allows something like the final piece of the puzzle, and he succeeds in an entirely self-sustainable, eternal power source with no potential for further anomalies.

Either way, its not really a win if we're on the side of the humans, because the Matrix is effectively preserved, minus a fraction of those awoken and sent to Zion, because you're right, there was no crash. But only those who want out can get out. There were those who were entirely unaware of the ""immersion breaking"" events, and those people help facilitate the new iteration (or adjusted same iteration).

Lol how do you know about Morpheus' continued fight? And goes without saying, if he does continue, the peace will end and Zion will face destruction once again"
2052,2020-05-03 22:24:30,gcesz4,"That was my understanding, too, that those plugged in were ‘restored’. I remember reading that Smith took over everyone, including programs (like Oracle, Sati and Seraph) and we know those were restored.

Also, you’re choice if words is my sentiment exactly; Neo changed the paradigm altogether. 

What is interesting is the notion that Neo’s code imprinted onto Smith at the end of 1, and probably during Reloaded. Smith also assimilated everyone else including programs. There may be bits of Neo and Smith code floating around the Matrix. If The Matrix Online remains canon, that ought to be relevant to Neo’s return. And Smith should have a presence to try to balance the equation."
2053,2020-05-03 00:24:08,gcesz4,"There was a continuation in the form of an online game. Where players could interact with characters like Morpheus and Niobe. The Architect eventually ruled that humans breached the parameters of the Truce Neo initiated. 

It’s remains canon, though it’s my opinion it will be retconned for a few reasons.

Regarding the Architect’s pursuit of the perfect system; I don’t think he is trying any longer to balance the equation. He just manipulates the anomaly and works with other machines to facilitate the cycle of the One.

If there is no more Matrix, then there is no need for the Architect, so I would imagine he wants the cycle to continue, perfect or imperfect.

The Merovingian also needs the Matrix to survive, for now. He was able to gain control over sentinels and have a Real world presence. So his sentinels could always serve the Architect’s purpose, if needed."
2054,2020-05-04 00:16:41,gcesz4,"Exactly! This is how Neo was able to reload without the Architect. The requisite dissemination of the code of the One that the Architect told him about was achieved despite Neo failing to comply with the mandated ""process"". Neo found a way to do it himself, thanks to Smith's assimilation of EVERYONE. Even exiles and programs were affected. It's genius."
2055,2020-05-03 00:28:12,gcesz4,"Now THAT, I did not know; that the Merovingian had control of the Sentinels. Where do you find that out?

As far as the game, it's weird that a video game would be canon for movies and books, but I suppose it's possible, and it certainly makes me wish I had learned about it before they shut it down.

Finally, yea thats all im saying: The Architect needs the system, so he'll fight to protect it, which he succeeded in doing, so the entire trilogy was a failure, in terms of the end goal."
2056,2020-05-04 00:29:11,gcesz4,"You mention something, I’m not sure if it is intentional; Neo was able to reload (the Matrix) without the Architect?! Was that Neo’s intention? I know the ‘deal’ he made was vague and it produced a truce that the Architect had parameters for, but it hadn’t occurred to me until this post that Neo intended to reload the Matrix. He planned to delete smith, but was killed in doing so. His body was then taken away and, possibly, mined for code for the machines to reload the Matrix. I’m not certain that they did reload to version 7. My thought was that version 6’was repaired and continued on in a state of limbo without the cycle continuing and no ‘One’ coming. A new era resting on the shoulders of Neo’s Truce. It’s a fragile time with exponential uncertainty."
2057,2020-05-03 00:34:29,gcesz4,"The Merovingian’s cunning is impressive. He really does not loose often and when he does, it’s a calculated loss.

I don’t believe the trilogy to be a failure. But if one keeps their eye on Neo, they won’t take in all the details. Trinity and the Oracle have much larger roles. Oracle’s manipulation, for seemingly nothing more than her entertainment, is immense!

Trinity’s influence is very much under the radar and hopefully they reveal more in part 4 regarding her importance."
2058,2020-05-04 03:33:10,gcesz4,"That fragile time is exactly why I say that Neo's efforts were not an absolute success. And the fact that the Architect had parameters for this ""Option C"" is also a reason; if your foe has knowledge of all of your choices and produces the proper countermeasures, your chance of winning is null. Fuethermore, since the Matrix was repaired, by default, humanity must not be fully free then.

And paradigm shift or not, the fact that the Matrix is stable, and if the end goal is freedom from the Machines captivity, then Neo failed to achieve that goal, merely rearranging the strictures of the Machines' reign.

Granted, the goal changed, when Smith started to take over and when the Machines started in on Zion, to wiping the Smith Virus, but switching goals is evidence that one knows they're going to fail and they're attempting to salvage the situation.

I'm also wondering what he meant when he said Neo reloaded the Matrix without the Architect. I never even got the sense that he reloaded it at all.

I guess I'll cede that it wasn't a *total* failure, because there is shaky peace for the time being, but the humans, by no means, won the Machine War. Which means the opposer's won, and since the Architect (who I'm going to theorize here is Deus Ex Machinas' RSI), is the leader, he won.

This comment has points related to all who are in this thread."
2059,2020-05-04 05:36:09,gcesz4,"Reload was the only way to save everyone. It was necessary because now it wasn't just the Matrix that would crash. Smith was going to obliterate EVERYTHING.

Neo was a wreck after he saves Trinity. He's hiding in his room, Roland is getting pissed because everyone seems to be dicking around waiting for Neo to DO something. Problem is, Neo didn't know what to do.

He talks to the Oracle one last time and tells everyone he needs to go to the Machine City. I don't think at this point he knows for sure exactly what he'll do when he gets there. He only tells Trinity ""There’s something I have to say. Something you need to understand. I know I’m supposed to go. But beyond that – I don’t know…""

Initially, he is trying to stop Smith. It's impossible. There is no way to subdue billions of Smiths. But he tries anyway. Then, at the end of the fight he realizes that fighting isn't the answer. Up to that point he CHOSE to fight, to wield the power he had. Then he makes another choice. He chooses to be the Christ figure and NOT fight. He willingly surrenders, realizing that Smith has provided him with a way to save everyone. In the first movie, he assimilated Smith and destroyed him. Now, he allows Smith to assimilate him. This closes the loop. The code is disseminated and the whole of the Matrix is united, if only briefly. This unification is necessary for reload. Smith is again deleted, but since Neo is jacked directly into the Source, Smith could not escape into exile.

Neo drops the mic."
2060,2020-05-03 00:39:15,gcesz4,I only mean the trilogy was a failure in the sense that Morpheus' goal of freeing the human race from the Machine's draconian grasp was a failure. They only freed a fraction of the population and weren't able to wipe out the Matrix at all.
2061,2020-05-04 04:02:13,gcesz4,"I never got the sense Neon reloaded the Matrix either, but I’m not opposed to the notion.

I believe Dey’s ex machine and Architect are different. Architect may have no real world presence and DEM may have no Matrix presence. But I’m not married to those notions, either.

Finally, I do not believe the trilogy to be a contest between Neo and Architect. It is probably closer to Architect v Oracle. I can only guess her motives are out of boredom rather than a sense of morality."
2062,2020-05-04 06:00:59,gcesz4,"I guess it depends on how you define ""success"".

Did Neo free everyone?

Nope.

Is that even realistic at this point?

Nope.

Neo succeeded in breaking everyone - man, machine, program/exile - out of the loop they were in. One of the Machine's main problems is that they are stagnant. Static perfection does not allow them to grow. Keeping humans forced them to adapt. But their growth rate had slowed. They were literally in a circular rut. The Oracle recognized this. Her purpose was to facilitate change as best she could. But she was not capable of making it happen on her own. She needed a mediator who would be willing to NOT choose the door on the right and then...make a new path. It was, as the Architect tells her, a dangerous game. It nearly destroyed everyone.

Evolution doesn't happen overnight. If success to your mind means that the humans are back on top of the food chain, then success is still a long ways away.

I think the Oracle envisions the eventual restoration of symbiosis.

Whatever the future holds, Neo took a BIG step in the right direction."
2063,2020-05-03 01:08:04,gcesz4,"Yeah, absolutely. The object of the franchise changed when Neo chose the other door. Neo’s exposure to certain programs changed the goal from the destruction of the matrix to a harmonious co-existence."
2064,2020-05-04 04:31:53,gcesz4,"I never said the fight was between Neo and the Architect. I simply said the Architect won. And even after all this, I still stand by that belief.

The interaction between the Architect and the Oracle most definitely reveals that she was the true mastermind behind this iteration of the One. I think she even eluded to this boredom, or maybe just a desire for change, in the second movie when she was talking to Neo before the big fight with the Smiths."
2065,2020-05-03 01:23:49,gcesz4,"Yea ok, true that. Still a failure😂😂 I mean temporary success but that peace treaty will never last as long as there are people trying to fight to free humanity. I guess if Morpheus could change his perspective from that of freeing people to facilitating the transition of those who wake up by their own accord, they might be able to maintain peace. But as of the end of the trilogy, it doesn't seem like that change happens."
2066,2020-05-04 06:04:58,gcesz4,"The Architect doesn't care about winning or losing. If Neo had failed, he would have been destroyed along with everyone else.

So in this sense, I agree that the Architect ""won"". Everyone did. The only ""loser"" was Smith."
2067,2020-05-04 19:23:23,gcesz4,"Ok so his success was contingent upon Neo's success. Nevertheless. And regardless of his own intention, whether to win or not, he still did.

All I'm saying in all of this is that after all the dust settled, and given time, the only being that would have what they want is The Architect.

Edit spelling"

Wearing masks suck but I truly believe that mandatory mask wearing will prevent a second wave. Just baffles me how many people don’t see it.

If everyone besides little children, and adults with heart and lung issues wear masks, we’ll prevent a second wave AND bring back our economy. But no, people still believe wearing masks takes away their rights. I’m like really? Do you really want to go back to how it was in April? Wear your damn mask!"

2138,2020-06-26 18:35:26,hg8z43,I took that to mean that they are going to allow guests in-person next year. It doesn’t specify what they’re doing for their virtual event this year. I was picturing them still shooting off fireworks but you just have to watch it on TV or something lol. I’m not too sure what other kind of activities they could do virtually for the 4th besides some random country singers performing? (Why is it always country music?)
2139,2020-06-26 23:42:59,hg8z43,Nope. I believe there was some executive order regarding COVID testing and treatment that made it free for all insurance plans.

We've had Teams for three years, from when it was in beta. I've been pushing it this whole time, but reception was lukewarm. Now it's the most popular app we have.

I made it so easy to do WFH, not only did they decide to keep us home for the duration, they decided we could stay like this almost indefinitely."

Even if you do it at an undisclosed location, somehow that information will leak and people will find a way to gather and watch it in person, which is exactly what they're trying to avoid."
2147,2020-06-26 18:38:48,hg8z43,I think I read or heard that NBC was going to do a multi night showing of the best of the other 39 years of fireworks.

2150,2020-06-26 19:41:27,hg8z43,Can't wait to watch some old shows in standard definition!
2151,2020-06-26 14:46:10,hg8sde,Well either way we'll know for sure by 20125
2152,2020-06-26 15:05:32,hg8sde,"Smith and Kohli would need 4 more years of peak form(~1000 runs per year) to make it in, or 2 years of peak form and 3-4 below average years(by their standards). Considering the fact that both are already 31 and Kohli will be close to 32 by the time India next play a Test, it'll be tough for them imo."
2153,2020-06-26 16:33:40,hg8sde,"It looks unlikely because the number of test matches   are most likely going to be reduced (unfortunately). With a lesser number of test matches being played, it is improbable that any of the current players can break in the top 5, at least."
2154,2020-06-26 15:10:44,hg8sde,"So Root needs just under 4000 runs to breach the top 10, between 2015 and the end of 2019 he scored 5627 runs but that was with his two huge years in 2015 and 2016...so in theory assuming no great drop off even on his runs scored per year since taking the captaincy and if that were too remain the same, he’d be around about there by 2025. 

If he finds that 2015/16 form again then he’ll do it sooner.

I was going to do the maths for Smith and Kohli but I lost motivation, they’re both around 300 runs behind Root at the moment and they both have higher averages but play slightly less test cricket, should still both get there by 2025."
2155,2020-06-26 19:31:46,hg8sde,"The photo of Cook looks like it wouldn't be out of place on the Mean Girls poster. 

Root has the best chance because he's the youngest and he plays the most. I expect he won't decline as much as Smith or Kohli because he doesn't have the pressure of being an all-format captain and because his technique isn't so dependant on hand-eye co-ordination."
2156,2020-06-26 22:49:23,hg8sde,"It's so cool to see that the 2nd guy in this list (2nd only to the master, Tendulkar) is from Australia's smallest state.  You have Sachin, from a culture of 1 billion people, then Punter from an island of .5 million. :)"
2157,2020-06-27 03:01:55,hg8sde,"With the year long ban, now COVID, I don’t think we’ll see Smith make many of these lists. Which is unfortunate, because his skill and development as a player puts him on par with many of these players and ahead of most."
2158,2020-06-26 20:46:20,hg8sde,Unlikely for Kane as he won't play enough tests....specially now with boarders closed.
2159,2020-06-26 15:00:38,hg8sde,Where are the active players?
2160,2020-06-27 03:04:55,hg8sde,"I think it's possible for Smith to maintain his current form for another 30 Tests (another 3 years from this day).

He scored 3,255 runs in his past 30 Tests.

So maintaining that pace would mean he'll have a career total of 10,482 runs a few weeks after he turns 34 years old.

From there the top 5 will be well within reach.

It will all depend on how long Smith wants to keep playing. Because, lets say at 38 years old he's a 50% worse batsman than he is now, he'd still be in Australia's best 6 batsmen."
2161,2020-06-26 14:51:35,hg8sde,Yeah that’s for sure!
2162,2020-06-26 15:07:02,hg8sde,Agreed let’s see when they Retire.
2163,2020-06-27 07:50:26,hg8sde,"I don't see why either of them can't play into their late 30s, they're both extremely fit."
2164,2020-06-26 17:21:33,hg8sde,The big 3 will keep playing test matches because they can afford it. Unfortunately test matches keep losing money for other teams if they're not playing either one of big 3.
2165,2020-06-26 15:14:39,hg8sde,All 3 Need 3500-3800 Runs to breach the Top 10. So considering a slight drop in form for all of them they would need at least 45-55 games at the max to get there. Let’s see if that happens.
2166,2020-06-27 00:16:59,hg8sde,"Root has already declined.

Averaged 53 before captaincy. 

43 since."
2167,2020-06-27 05:39:11,hg8sde,Sachin comes from a cult de sac with 7 houses and 400 people.. truly..  a cultural culdesac phenomenon
2168,2020-06-26 21:29:04,hg8sde,"Yeah he needs 4699 runs more to enter the 10th position now mad even he did get them he won’t be in Top 10 probably since Kohli, Root and Smith would certainly end up scoring more than him because they play more matches than New Zealand."
2169,2020-06-26 15:06:22,hg8sde,"Top 5 in Active Players 

1. Joe Root - 7599

2. David Warner - 7244

3. Virat Kohli - 7240

4. Ross Taylor - 7238 

5. Steve Smith - 7227 

Williamson at 6476"
2170,2020-06-27 08:07:36,hg8sde,"Few players make many runs in their late 30s in the modern game. Since the turn of the century,  only 6 players have managed to score over 2000 runs past the age of 36. Plus, Smith is very reliant on his hand-eye coordination which could very well result in a steep decline later. Kohli also has the pressure of being an all-format captain which will may take a mental toll. Not to say it's impossible of course, just that it'll be very tough to make runs at that age."
2171,2020-06-26 15:40:25,hg8sde,"Yeah it’ll be quite interesting to see if all 3 can maintain the sort of form they’ve shown throughout their careers, or in Roots case find his very best again.

They’ll all definitely end up in that top 10 by the end of their careers, it’s just a case of how high."
2172,2020-06-27 01:17:15,hg8sde,That’s true to a certain Extent.
2173,2020-06-27 09:42:33,hg8sde,"I don't expect him to stay at 43, he'll probably at least regain some of his old form. Even averaging 43 he only needs 4 or 5 years to get on the list, which isn't that improbable."
2174,2020-06-27 02:11:10,hg8sde,I just hope Kane can crack 10k.
2175,2020-06-26 16:35:45,hg8sde,"I hope Williamson breaks past the 10,000 runs barrier. It would be wonderful to see someone from NZ at the top."
2176,2020-06-26 15:09:30,hg8sde,"With the amount of test cricket England and Australia play, Root and Smith are a lock for top 10."
2177,2020-06-26 15:12:52,hg8sde,Expecting Kohli to be there as well. But let’s see. Corona Virus is spoiling things.

2190,2020-06-27 08:36:28,hg77wd,"Newcastle was our last good chance to survive. Even with a win today we need to rely on so many unlikely results going our way. 

We fucked it when we had the chance, we fucked it when we played the other relegation contenders, now we need to get wins against top sides and also have other results go our way."
2191,2020-06-26 13:36:11,hg77wd,"I totally understand why people will be worried about Adama Traore, but I'm not sure why Targett has taken so much stick since the restart.

Yes he can do better, but has he really been that bad? According to Whoscored ratings Targett was our 3rd best player vs Sheffield United, our 2nd best player against Chelsea and our 8th best player vs Newcastle. He's come up against some really tough opponents (Willian and Saint-Maximin) and not exactly been ripped apart or made loads of mistakes, especially when he's not 100% fit and has to play 4 games in 11 days. He hasn't got forward much but again that comes back to fitness and our much more defensive game plan."

2193,2020-06-26 15:22:48,hg77wd,"You seen his interview? 

The guy is deluded, he was complaining that 2 up top makes it hard for jack to play and that you go from back to front too quickly. 

Imo thats been the issue non stop, we go from the back to front so slowly that either we loose the ball on the way or they have time to get back, regroup and put pressure on us. 

Everything he is moaning about is everything i think causes us issues. Saying that we basically HAVE to go through the midfield first. As if cutting the midfield out and going on a fast counter is some sort of issue. 

We cant even pass ffs, yet he wants us to play it out the back nice and slow so it makes it easier for the opponents to defend. 

He’s lost the plot, for me, we stay up or go down smith has to go."

2199,2020-06-26 13:41:24,hg77wd,"I'm not saying he's been bad at all, I really rate him. But I feel for any defender coming up against Traore."
2200,2020-06-26 16:28:51,hg77wd,"It's funny because when Davis has started, we've completely bypassed the midfield and just twatted it upfront and immediately lost it with Davis' massive touches."
2201,2020-06-26 17:34:58,hg77wd,"He is not wrong in that 2 up top makes it difficult to play jack with freedom. If you look at any clubs playing 2 up top successfully, none of them have a creative midfielder in the lineup. Burnley is the closest example to our level and they have 4 industrious players in their middle bank of 4. We don’t have a right or left mid besides maybe Elmo. If you play a narrow formation with jack behind the two you have no width. That formation worked for Real Madrid because they have talented players but also super intelligent mids and center backs. We don’t have that."
2202,2020-06-26 17:42:42,hg77wd,Debating between Jimenez or Traore for me. Painful to watch how great Traore has gotten :(
2203,2020-06-26 13:47:49,hg77wd,"Yep, totally agree. Tough job for anyone on Saturday and I’d back Traore to remind us what a huge mistake it was to sell him/swap him cheap.

I’ve just seen a huge amount of stick for Targett since the Newcastle game so thought somebody should defend him!"
2204,2020-06-26 14:21:21,hg77wd,"He's done quite a lot for us this year, primarily getting us to a cup final. He was expensive, but it wasn't going to be easy to find a cheap left back with premier league experience and some quality."

2242,2020-06-26 22:36:04,hg3t7c,"If we are looking for more movies to add to this shared universe, these are some movies that look like good candidates.

The *Running Man*, which has Arnold Schwarzenegger (*Predator*, *Total Recall*), María Conchita Alonso (*Predator 2*), Yaphet Kotto (*Alien 1*), Jesse Ventura (*Predator 1*), and Sven-Ole Thorsen (*Predator 1* and in *Soldier*, though only a stuntman).

*Soldier* (mentioned elsewhere in this thread)

*Event Horizon* (mentioned elsewhere in this thread)

The *Terminator* series as an alternate timeline (mentioned elsewhere in this thread)

*Westworld*, which could be fit in somewhere if we accept that Delos exists after *Blade Runner 2* when Replicants are abandoned, but before Synthetics are introduced on a large scale.

*Moon*, which would tie really well into the *Blade Runner* universe all by itself.

*****

Movies I wish I could add, but probably shouldn't:

* *Escape From New York*: If considered as contemporary with the events of *RoboCop 1* and *Predator 2*, it would fit in pretty well. Crime is rampant everywhere, it has Kurt Russell and Harry Dean Stanton, and it introduces fusion energy as a working technology from the 1980s onward. Unfortunately it also had a sequel which wipes out LA just a couple years after the events of *Predator 2* and causes a worldwide blackout at the end of the second movie (in real life, likely a shower of EMP attacks all over the planet). This supposedly happens in 2013, which would make it impossible for Tyrell Corporation to have their headquarters in Los Angeles.

* *2001: Space Odyssey* and *2010*: The ""Apple Wins the World"" aesthetic fits, the computers look superficially similar, and the problems with HAL-9000 illustrate the problem of keeping AI from turning on you, but widespread knowledge of extraterrestrials isn't ever supposed to be commonplace. Governments, corporations, and the military may know about them, but the average person? Their first encounter with evidence of Predators or Xenomorphs or the Engineers is always a shock to them. Having Jupiter explode into a star while HAL-9000 sends an SMS back home for everyone to read, kind of takes away from all that."

It follows that the first encounter with the predator made Dutch the ideal candidate for the prototype of the Model 101 Terminator. in T2, Cyberdyne is bankrupted by the destruction of their work on Skynet and the Terminator chip, in the original timeline, it's Yautja (predator species) tech that is the basis for the advancement, But in T2, we see it was the terminator itself. When The Terminator is destroyed by Sarah Connor, and Later by John and Sara along with another Terminator, Cyberdyne is bankrupted, but enough of their research survives and is bought out by Weyland-Yutani. 

Weyland then proceeds to use this research as the foundation for the first Synthetic Humans or Replicants, The tech that goes into Skynet is repurposed instead of military satellites, but to long distance spacecraft as part of the M.O.T.H.E.R. Core in Alien."

2252,2020-06-28 09:19:32,hg3t7c,The TV series Firefly has a connection to this universe as one of their auto-cannons has a Weyland-Yutani operating system in it.
2253,2020-06-29 01:34:12,hg3t7c,"I don't think this was intended by the writers, but it's a fun theory, so I'll go with it. And there are at least two more shows you could link to Alien, Blade Runner, and the rest.

  
Firstly, there are some connections to Firefly:

* In the first episode of Firefly there is a Weyland-Yutani logo on Mal's screen.
* The design of the Nostromo is very similar to that of an Alliance Cruiser from Firefly.
* In Serenity the Operative says ""We're making a better world"" which sounds almost like the Weyland-Yutani slogan ""building better worlds"".
* In several Alien novels and comics there is a single Terran government. This government could be the Sino-American Alliance from Firefly.
* In Firefly there was a mass exodus from Earth. In Alien Resurrection it is implied that Earth is uninhabitable. In Blade Runner the planet appears to be dying, and people are encouraged to leave Earth.
* Reavers from Firefly are a failed attempt to mass-reprogram humans. Could be based on technology from Total Recall and/or Blade Runner.
* The first draft of the script of Alien Resurrection was written by Joss Whedon
* In Alien Resurrection we see a xenomorph-human hybrid. If they continued research into hybridization of these two species, perhaps they would eventually be able to create mostly human hybrid-supersoldiers like River Tam.

There are also some possible connections to Battlestar Galactica.

* Battlestar Galactica takes place 150,000 years in the past, and it ends with the characters arriving on Earth.
* The humanoid Cylons are very similar to Replicants from Blade Runner.
* One of the big themes of Battlestar Galactica is that history keeps repeating itself. So it would make sense if the descendants of the Twelve Colonies eventually developed robots and Replicants. And sooner or later there would have to be another robot/replicant uprising followed by a mass exodus from their planet.
* There's also a deliberate Firefly easter egg in one episode of BSG where you can see a Serenity type spaceship.

Something else just occured to me. Xenomorphs are one of the favourite preys of the Predators. They like hunting them so much that they transport Xenomorph eggs to different planets where they can procreate.

Humans are also one of their favourite preys so they don't want us to go extinct. This is implied in the first AVP movie when the Predators had to nuke an ancient pyramid city because the Xenomorphs had reproduced uncontrollably so that there were too many of them. This could have gone wrong easily, and the Predators probably know this.

So perhaps there are sanctuary planets out there where humans can live and reproduce freely (except for the occasional visit by Predators in a hunting mood). And perhaps this is where planet Kobol and the Twelve Colonies from Battlestar Galactica come from."
2254,2020-07-04 19:16:02,hg3t7c,"And who knows but maybe this will just get folded into the Marvel Comic Universe.

https://movieweb.com/alien-predator-comic-books-marvel-crossover-2021/"
2255,2020-07-07 10:03:59,hg3t7c,"Great theory and research! My one addition to it would be that Predators is between 2005-2009, since the AA-12 shotgun Adrian Brody's character uses went into production for military and police use until 2005. This, along with the clothing and equipment the more military oriented characters wear appears to be more modern, similar to what is used by current armed forces and PMCs."

2257,2020-06-26 18:08:51,hg3t7c,"It’s a fun theory, but that’s not really pertinent to his struggle or the story as a whole. His whole conflict was about facing his mortality. It’s not that he’s seen aliens. It’s the fact that he’s this superior creature that’s witnessed and lived incredible moments that humans probably can’t. And that those moments will disappear when he does. 

I understand this is fan theories, and it’s fun to think about."
2258,2020-06-26 17:37:38,hg3t7c,"I had thought that Pitch Black would have fit perfectly into the Aliens/Predator Universe, then Chronicles of Riddick came along and ruined that (I think).

2260,2020-06-26 13:30:26,hg3t7c,"I was going to say.  Soldier is the best connection (IMO).  I consider it likely he was an early form of replicant, already in the process of being replaced with the next best thing."
2261,2020-06-26 19:04:10,hg3t7c,"I'd considered looking at *Soldier* but never got around to it. I like the movie and its story would be quite fitting in the 'grunge tech' universe.

It has Gary Busey in it as a military character, which is a big plus.

It has Jason Isaacs and Sean Pertwee, who were both in *Event Horizon* (another worthy suggestion).

It has Carsten Norgaard, who was also in *AVP 1*.

It has Elizabeth Dennehy, who was also in *Total Recall*.

Though Jeremy Bolt had only a bit part in *Soldier*, he was co-producer of *Event Horizon*, which might count for something, I don't know."
2262,2020-06-26 17:52:37,hg3t7c,Holy shit. I had no idea that took place in the same universe. I also don't think I've seen it since the early 2000s...
2263,2020-06-26 21:31:26,hg3t7c,"man, I haven't seen Soldier since I watched it on TV back when I was still in highschool, now I watch it last night and all the sudden see it referenced today. 

I also never put together that it was supposed to be the same universe, but then again I don't think there are any threads connecting the two other than the screenwriters intentions. 

thats super cool though, and now I'll probably be thinking about it the rest of the day, thanks for the cool fact."
2264,2020-06-26 18:57:04,hg3t7c,"This would have to be a different, special kind of FTL that ships like the *Nostromo*, *Sulaco*, *Betty*, and *Auriga* don't use. Maybe it's supposed to be instant teleportation instead of space warp. In theory, *Event Horizon* was supposed to go straight to Alpha Centauri and back from Neptune orbit. But the designer of the engine didn't, shall we say, have all the facts.

Both *Event Horizon* and *Predator 3* have Lawrence Fishburne, so there's that."

I remember reading that the director deliberately chose that year because it would be far enough from the year of release, 1990, that the film wouldn't appear dated too soon-- like ""Blade runner"" did, with its 2019 setting. I don't mind that, though, because I don't expect science fiction films to accurately predict the future so much as to accurately reflect the present."
2268,2020-06-26 18:33:15,hg3t7c,"With *Total Recall* we get Kuato, who has the ability to read minds and unlock memories. Basically a telepath, so the Precogs wouldn't be unprecedented."

That was a really entertaining movie.  And at the end, when he’s holding the boy, just a minor tilt of his head and so much is conveyed."
2271,2020-06-26 14:58:01,hg3t7c,"I think while these genre and sub genre distinctions are often useful, particularly when creating an aesthetic, too many sub genres gets in the way as often as it helps."
2272,2020-06-26 11:12:55,hg3t7c,"Improvisation or not, they left it in the movie."
2273,2020-06-26 11:47:30,hg3t7c,"What I think of as ""Cyberpunk"" is neon and chrome, shiny and glowing and looking futuristic. Lots of color, electric everything. There's some of that in *Blade Runner 1* and *2* and in the *RoboCop* movies to a lesser extent but I believe it's all gone in a hundred years, or it just makes it out into space where all of that glorious future stuff just seems pretentious company propaganda.

The sets of *Nostromo*, Gateway Station, *Sulaco*, and Hadley's Hope are dirty, colorless, not very shiny, and frankly rather primitive. Yes, *Alien* was made in 1979 and computer graphics weren't that great but I'd say the style is kind of burnt-in to the atmosphere of the whole show. In the video games they are faithful to this aesthetic to the point where they try to avoid anything that looks _too_ futuristic (except when showing Space Jockey or Predator tech) because it will clash with what weak strides humans have made.

It's also a way to represent visually the prevailing mood of the people living and working in space or the off-world colonies. Nobody likes their job, everyone feels like just a gear in the machine. It's supposed to be utopia, but it's a fake plastic utopia that the company shoves down your throat so you don't grumble about how small your shares are going to turn out to be."
2274,2020-06-26 14:31:27,hg3t7c,The entire speech wasnt improvised. Just part of it at the end
2275,2020-09-11 16:20:27,hg3t7c,"Sorry to resurrect an old thread, but when I heard about the genre ""Cassette Retro"" or [Cassette Futurism](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassetteFuturism) the other day, I realized it was exactly what I'd been looking for.

But you are right to say that a lot of it (especially the neon parts, flying cars, film noir plot exposition) is definitive cyberpunk."
2276,2020-06-26 18:50:50,hg3t7c,"I thought about that, but didn't look for any similar characters or possible easter eggs that could link the two. Similar story and genre isn't enough to bring it in."
2277,2020-06-26 18:44:06,hg3t7c,"Honestly, most of the work was just manhandling the copy and paste from the actor lists to let Word process them into a table that would let me sort by any data value."
2278,2020-06-26 18:07:48,hg3t7c,"It’s not healthy to think this hard about cyberpunk, but if you’re gonna do it then you might as well bun the rest of us out too"
2279,2020-06-26 19:35:56,hg3t7c,"Given that in at least one instance one of them conceived a child with a human, that suggests they are closer to genetically modified human than synthetics.

Meaning while a Xenomorph facehugger wouldn't care for coupling with Ash or Bishop, one might try to impregnate a Nexus-6 or better. But since we see no Xeno experiments with Replicants, It might have been a dead end or just too expensive to use a Replicant or a human clone just to make a chestburster--cheaper just to snatch someone off the space lane in a cryotube and use them instead."
2280,2020-06-26 20:07:30,hg3t7c,"It's tempting, but the *Terminator* universe adds time travel which is a whole other can of worms. Skynet also makes AI creation look way too easy. Synthetic intelligence of a form that can interface with human society without getting rejected seems really, really hard to do right. Ash and David were basically sociopathic time bombs, Bishop was far too deferential and pacifistic (refusing a handgun even for self-defense), and Call was an emotional mess. No wonder synthetics seemed to have been phased out by *Alien 4*'s era. Network-based AI with parallel computing as a cyberpunkish element seems conspicuously absent in all the Grunge Tech movies.

Skynet and David are both homicidal racist fanatics but with very different origins. The *Terminator* universe has a strong bias against AI. Any attempt to build one ends up dooming the human race to a Machine War. At the end of *Terminator 2*, both HK CPUs had to be destroyed or someone else would just make the same mistake as Dyson and Cyberdyne. It also carries the unfortunate implication that the human race is always going to be racing against time (so to speak) because someone else will eventually create another AI and start the process all over again.

You would have to put all the *Terminator* movies aside as alternate future history which eventually leads to humans trying Replicant technology first, before doing anything related to AI (and definitely no distributed computing, anywhere, for any reason). Install the best behavioral inhibitors on your synths and keep the big computers (ship and station systems) 'dumb', so to speak, or use a mainframe and dumb terminal arrangement like on the *Nostromo* (with FTL communication), so that any AI that gets ""smart"" can't avoid getting terminated before it starts getting genocidal notions.

The *Terminator* continuity is a hot mess all by itself, but if you accept every movie in the series as an another timeline that eventually leads back to a timeline where Skynet accidentally erases itself from existence and disinvents the time machine altogether (a common trope for time travel), then maybe you could make it work."
2281,2020-06-26 21:28:20,hg3t7c,up above theres a comment saying that the screenwriter for soldier with kurt russel was supposed to take place in the same universe as blade runner.
2282,2020-06-26 22:31:56,hg3t7c,"As an aside, if you wanted to add the *Terminator* movies, you could say that Bill Paxton's character ended up getting killed by the T-100, when in the ""normal timeline"", he grows up to be a police officer in Detroit.

*The Terminator* also has Dwayne Hicks' ancestor Kyle Reese become a Resistance fighter in the SkyNet alternate future, which by implication makes Dwayne Hicks a direct descendant of John Connor (assuming he still exists when humanity escapes Judgment Day)."
2283,2020-06-27 00:24:04,hg3t7c,"All really good points!

So all the synthetic skin, sweat, and bad breath SkyNet used for the advancd HKs got shifted over to Replicant engineering?"
2284,2020-06-26 18:41:26,hg3t7c,"Basically, I made a table listing every actor, the name of their character, and a short summary of the role they played. In some cases people appeared more than once like Schwarzenegger and Bill Paxton. They are the most solid connections. The table also made it possible to find all the similar character names."
2285,2020-06-26 18:08:35,hg3t7c,"I hadn’t thought of that, but it’s totally cyberpunk-adjacent at the least"
2286,2020-06-26 18:45:58,hg3t7c,"*Pitch Black* was a nice sci-fi movie but *Chronicles of Riddick* basically turned it into a science fantasy universe.

I haven't seen *Westworld* in ages."
2287,2020-06-26 22:23:05,hg3t7c,"It’s a different studio I think, so I don’t know that it “officially” does take place in the same universe."
2288,2020-06-26 19:16:10,hg3t7c,"Also, Fisburne’s character is Captain Steven *Miller*.

The Event Horizon was an attempt to instantly jump from one point to another, which would require moving through the deepest parts of the Warp, no matter how briefly. The ship was adrift in there for years.

The early history of FTL after that might involve a safer, but much slower method of Warp travel that essentially “skims” over the “surface” of the Warp without really penetrating it.

The crew in Event Horizon uses a system of suspended animation gravity couches during acceleration to high subluminal speeds. The ships in Alien and Aliens also use a tech like this during long distance flight, perhaps as an extra precaution so that no one who is traveling through space realizes that their ship is essentially skipping across the surface of Hell like a rock thrown over a pond every time they go FTL.

I can probably come up with other connections, too. The second production Robocop unit is essentially a crude form of dreadnought..."

it's meant to be gross, riddled with disparity, and a cautious tale of progressing with no thoughts to consequence; only our capacity to do so.

honestly blade runner and its loosely used source are imo the defacto image of what is 'cyberpunk'"
2293,2020-06-26 13:35:52,hg3t7c,"I think it’s pretty fair to call this stuff cyberpunk, especially given the themes of sociopathic megacorporations and humans being treated as disposable.

This all reminded me of Neuromancer, where in the end a super AI realizes there’s an AI in Alpha Centauri that it plans to go meet"
2294,2020-06-26 21:45:56,hg3t7c,"What you think of as cyberpunk is not at all anything to do with cyberpunk. Cyberpunk is a near futuristic Earth with a post technological movement creating a dystopic industrialization and megacorporate setting. It often centers around downtrodden loners living on the fringes of society and features themes pertaining to the cautions of rapid technological advancement, often with heavy noir undertones.

Blade Runner is irrefutably one of the most iconic examples of cyberpunk as a genre in film. I don't know how you managed to write an entire essay on Blade Runner and not realise the genre of storytelling it falls under but it would probably do you well to read up on what cyberpunk actually is."
2295,2020-06-26 19:08:04,hg3t7c,I get it. I also wanted to add starship troopers but that brings up the same issue.
2296,2020-06-27 00:28:58,hg3t7c,"Yeap, and the Replicant engineering was repurposed into the Androids in Alien as they became more and more advanced. The Revolts you hear about in Bladerunner happens in The background of Alien, the Replicants/Android actually begin to make androids themselves, full Synthetics. This is likely why they were not allowed on Earth"
2297,2020-06-26 18:48:38,hg3t7c,Ok I gotcha. I’m a big fan of a lot of these movies so I really enjoyed your post and analysis. Thanks a lot.
2298,2020-06-26 21:33:20,hg3t7c,"Like *Total  Recall* and *Outland*, *Event Horizon* has someone getting effectively spaced. Unlike the other two movies, Justin does not immediately explode like a balloon, but the effects of exposure are still exaggerated with immediate blood loss."
2299,2020-06-26 12:41:43,hg3t7c,"If it meant anything at all to the story, yeah. Why wouldn't the story as told be canon? Because you don't like it?"
2300,2020-06-26 14:30:04,hg3t7c,Are you implying its not canon that humans wear clothes and sometimes change those clothes in that universe??
2301,2020-06-27 22:31:43,hg3t7c,"[It wasn't an ""explicit scene""](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-rescuers-topless/), it was two separate frames in a single scene in which a photo of a topless woman was visible where an apartment window should have been in the background. It went unnoticed for 20 years because in order to see it, you had to freeze the video on exactly the right frames.

So no, it's not canon."
2302,2020-06-26 13:36:25,hg3t7c,The huge corporations treating people as stock is also a big cyberpunk thing
2303,2020-06-26 16:40:14,hg3t7c,"I agree with you like 95%.  *Blade Runner* is a great example of cyberpunk.  But it's not archetypal; the movie (especially the theatrical release) hits me like a synthesis of cyberpunk and noir, with elements of each played against the other.  I think this might be part of what the parent comment is getting at; *Blade Runner* uses motifs and style choices that feel distinctly out-of-place when compared the source novel, or to ""undiluted"" cyberpunk in general.

(Of course, *Neuromancer* appropriated noir as well— the Raymond Chandler comparison has been made more than once— but that one seems way more integrated to me.  A literary inspiration rather than a blurring of genre lines.)"
2304,2020-06-26 14:39:06,hg3t7c,And which Loa do you bargain with?
2305,2020-06-26 20:19:03,hg3t7c,"That's the punk part!  (Well, the resulting rebellion against authority.)"
2306,2020-06-26 17:57:30,hg3t7c,"Noir is a big part of cyberpunk though. *Blade Runner* and *Neuromancer* are really the prototypical cyberpunk texts and have noir elements. Case has that moral ambiguity of a noir gumshoe, and even moreso the streetwise affect in opposition to a semi-criminal and even less moral institution 

That interplay between noir and scifi is, I thought, one of the hallmarks of cyberpunk. To look at the future not as bright and utopian, nor even grittily operatic like *Star Wars*, but full of all the same bullshit around us today. The result of that clash of noir and scifi is a society in which, despite the fact that humans have reached space, everyone’s motivations and flaws are still grossly mundane."
2307,2020-06-26 21:40:42,hg3t7c,Cyberpunk often features heavy noir elements. Seperating the two like that serves no purpose. There's really no debate that Blade Runner is cyberpunk.
2308,2020-06-26 17:58:34,hg3t7c,"Sorry, Loa?"
2309,2020-06-26 21:58:12,hg3t7c,"> Noir is a big part of cyberpunk though.

I don't mean to suggest that it isn't, or to insist on a clean break between genres.  But there's cyberpunk without noir (I can't remember a hint of noir in the *Mirrorshades* anthology), and then on the other hand there's the theatrical release of *Blade Runner*, which I can't interpret as anything other than explicit pastiche.  Harrison Ford's voiceovers are, I guess, the dealbreaker for me; the director's cut works as pure cyberpunk.

(This is a different and smaller objection than the parent comment's, which I agree seems to be based on a limited view of the genre.  I absolutely agree that *Blade Runner*'s dystopian grime, pessimism, and darkness are not at all at odds with the cyberpunk genre.)"

You should follow him on twitter though, it’s kinda surreal to the the Neuromancer guy retweeting the shit that makes cyberpunk more real"
2315,2020-06-26 08:18:07,hg3n9n,Man I'd hate to be on clean up duty after say 20 folk had a yard of ale each. There's a technique to it to prevent you from spilling it all over your face. There would be a few sticky floors.
2316,2020-06-26 08:56:04,hg3n9n,"I used to get really triggered by Rees-Mogg.

I remember back in the day, when he got interviewed by Ali G. My recollection was that JR-M completely lost his rag and called Ali G a moron. This convinced me that JR-M was himself a fool, inasmuch as he was so severed from mainstream culture that he couldn't see he was being spoofed by Sacha Baron-Cohen, a man of much the same age as JR-M and from a similarly elite background.

This impression stuck with me for years until I re-watched the interview. 

Turns out I'd completely misremembered it. He actually handled it pretty well... although at times, it feels like it's two spoof comedy characters facing off, not just one, and that both men realise this."
2317,2020-06-26 08:22:07,hg3n9n,"And then there's the possibility of the what's just being drunk coming right back up again! 

On the face of it this could look like a rare good idea from the haunted pencil. But the more you think about it the worse this idea becomes."
2318,2020-06-26 08:28:16,hg3n9n,"I mean I presume he's being sarcastic or making a joke but yeah it's a horrible idea. 

Ale everywhere people getting far too drunk if they actually manage to drink it all. Would be horrible. 

Should stick to wellies ! Much easier to drink from."
2319,2020-06-26 08:29:50,hg3n9n,Drinking from Wellies? That brings back memories of the Uni Rugby team in the student union bar back in the day!
2320,2020-06-26 08:49:35,hg3n9n,Yeah exactly what I was thinking. Used to live with uni students in a HMO and fuck me the two rugby guys were mental.
2321,2020-06-26 08:52:14,hg3n9n,"The usual drinking game was ""Shoot The Boot"", which meant drinking beer from your shoe.

Needless to say that flip flops were strangely popular with that crowd! I used to wear Doc Martin's all the time back then so I gave that stuff a very wide berth."
2322,2020-06-26 08:55:25,hg3n9n,"Aye sounds like a solid plan dude. Or just don't drink with rugby guys generally. They are a different fucking species. 

Single best drinking game I've ever played was something two french exchange guys had us playing. They called it le gross poulet. Or the big chicken. I still have no idea what the rules were but it involved pots pans and a collinder needless to say with my French only being passable when spoken slowly and their English not being the best I ended up absolutely wankered."
2323,2020-06-26 07:01:21,hg26q0,It’s going to be comical no matter who wins between Perry and Gall.

2326,2020-06-26 15:10:19,hg26q0,Just realized with no crowd we will probably be able to hear Perry’s “coach” in his corner. As much as people think he’s gone off the deep end he’s always been a crazy mofo and he’s tough as shit. I think he makes easy work of Gall. I also think Hangman takes it. Get hype!
2327,2020-06-27 07:43:03,hg26q0,"Also adding this bit of minor information because this is one cause i can get behind.

Regardless if Poirier wins or loses, i'll be donating 50 USD to the Good Fight Foundation. He's got a heart of gold (or you could say, diamond) and its very clear he loves those kids and only wants them to be happy and thrive in this world. Beautiful stuff."
2328,2020-06-26 11:47:26,hg26q0,Damn opposite on gall and porier.  Very excited for the latter tho!  Brahimaj is out too.  Cornerman has covid

Great post and I agree with a lot of your picks! I think Gall vs perry is going to be a lot closer than people think, that’s just my opinion. 

P.s last week I won all my money back from earlier loses on emmet vs Burgos, that was fun to watch!!!"
2334,2020-06-27 15:48:49,hg26q0,"First of all, I really enjoy reading your posts  I'm not sure if this goes against the rules of the sub reddit or not, but I think it would be a real benefit if you posted the betting lines for each fight as well. That way we have an idea of who the favorite and under dog is for the fight."
2335,2020-06-27 18:49:08,hg26q0,"I dont know how good Worthys grappling is to comfortably bet on him. I suspect its trash and hell get finished if Pena gets him there. If he can keep it standing, I favour him heavily but I just dont know much of anything about his grappling."

2337,2020-06-29 17:27:45,hg26q0,Such a crazy night of fights. Good pick on Worthy. I shoulda known Lins was overhyped too
2338,2020-06-26 21:40:22,hg26q0,i just looked at your picks from this week and last week and can confidently say you suck
2339,2020-06-26 07:02:15,hg26q0,hahaha yep! can't take either of them seriously.
2340,2020-06-26 09:30:04,hg26q0,"yeah, he looked horrible in that fight, but i feel like maybe he'll take this fight more seriously."
2341,2020-06-26 12:09:49,hg26q0,"shit it wouldn't be a UFC event during the pandemic without someone testing positive. I probably won't change the prediction itself, so ignore it"
2342,2020-06-26 17:12:46,hg26q0,Yes that is true. And a slip up on my behalf and i apologise. We shall see if he can actually defeat Usman or not though
2343,2020-06-26 19:17:45,hg26q0,"Thank you so much for the kind words. Its beautiful people like you that motivate me to keep doing these. Soon enough youll recognise names and faces haha. I hope you and your family are staying safe, happy and healthy during these chaotic times. Thank you again for your kind words!"
2344,2020-06-26 19:22:41,hg26q0,Interim belt is just another way of saying top contender. Belt means nothing haha
2345,2020-06-27 08:58:56,hg26q0,"Thanks for the kind words, but i still subconsciously think that im responsible for people if i get a prediction wrong, i need to keep up a certain standard and i failed those standards last week haha."
2346,2020-06-26 22:45:45,hg26q0,Haha thats fair enough. Hope you enjoy the event its gonna be a good one!
2347,2020-06-28 00:52:51,hg26q0,No need for the negativity and he’s 4-2 so far should be 5-1 but Erosa shocked everyone
2348,2020-06-26 07:04:23,hg26q0,I think Perry is going to win this one although honestly I’d rather see Gall win for the simple fact that Perry is so hard headed and refuses to be coached... I have more credentials than his girlfriend and I’ve only had a couple Muay Thai fights and jiu jitsu competitions.
2349,2020-06-26 11:33:33,hg26q0,"it would be such a trip if his gf's dad was some old school mexican boxer that made sure his daughter understands the sweet science.

Sure, they may have had rough times, but all people have trials and tribulations. I don’t get the assertion that we have to believe as our ancestors did because they had hard times. 

And how far back are we going to go in maintaining the beliefs of our ancestors? Should we believe the earth is flat? That the sun moves around the earth?  That sacrificing doves will cure leprosy?"

2397,2020-06-26 03:38:22,hfzzwr,"I don’t think it comes in different grip sizes. I have my grandfather's vaquero in .44 and it's a lot of fun to shoot. I have pretty small hands (because I'm 13) and I've never had any grip problems with it. I don’t know how experienced you are, but you can’t cheap out on ear protection like I did (because I’m still pretty inexperienced). Usually I shoot .22 and it’s pretty quiet, so I used to have a pair of really shoddy earplugs that did the job for .22. one time they fell out of my ear at the range when I was shooting a .44 magnum... Tinnitus. Learned my lesson."
2398,2020-06-26 10:28:37,hfzzwr,"A few years ago, my wife got me a set of Eagle Grips' [""Gunfighter Grips""](https://www.eaglegrips.com/298-gunfighter-style-grips) for Christmas.  Most single-action grips taper to the top which is authentic, but feels weird to people more familiar with semiauto pistols, and isn't necessarily ideal when shooting hot modern cartridges.  The Gunfighter Grips add a wide plane at the top of the grip, which I find really increases the comfort and sense of security in my grip.  I loved my .357 Vaquero before, but now it's my very favorite gun to shoot.  

> If you have tried any of the Ruger Vaqueros and can offer advice or insight into how I can choose between the standard, Bisley, SASS, and bird’s head grips, I would greatly appreciate it! 

You're probably aware that the classic 19th century Colt Bisley grip was made for target guns:  it's harder to cock the hammer quickly, but the gun stays more firmly in your hand when slow-firing at the range.  

The Ruger Bisley grip is *not* that Colt Bisley grip.  

In the 1920s, sixgun legend Elmer Keith started carrying what he called the perfect Colt:  a revolver with a custom handle made from the frontstrap of a standard 1873, and the backstrap of a Bisley.  With the heavy-duty cartridge loads he was always tinkering with, he found this new shape made the revolver more controllable while also allowing it to be shot fast.  The gun was called ""Revolver No. 5,"" and this No. 5 grip is the basis of the Ruger Bisley grip.  So understand that the Ruger Bisley grip is not a 19th century cowboy style; it's an early 20th century gun crank style.  Fantastic grip, but may or may not be the style you're looking for.  

The primary purpose of the Ruger Bisley grip is for controlling the recoil of heavy magnum cartridges.  Its not at all necessary for .357, especially out of a heavy gun like a .357 Vaquero (because the Colt pattern was originally made for .45, if you drill .357 bores in it you end up with thicker barrel and chamber walls, and so with a heavier gun; the .357 Vaquero is a pussycat).  People still use them out of personal preference (heck, you can get Ruger Bisley grips on a .22 if you want), but if you don't already know you prefer it, you may be better off with the standard grip.  

The bird's head grip is intended for a carry gun, because rounding off the horn of the back of the handle makes a sixgun easier and more comfortable to carry in a concealment holster.  It's not ideal if you're looking for a range toy and CAS revolver.  Again, people do use them just out of preference, but if you don't already know you prefer it, you may be better off with the standard grip.  

Whatever Vaquero you get, I think you'll enjoy it.  It's a heck of a shooter."
2399,2020-06-26 23:01:33,hfzzwr,Get the standard grip. Bisley is for target shooting and bird's head isn't comfortable in my opinion. I have a .44 magnum new vaquero with the standard grip and it rolls back in the hand nicely to make cocking easier.
2400,2020-06-26 03:40:10,hfzzwr,"I’ve read that the grips I mentioned each fit the hand a bit differently. Some prefer standard over Bisley, vice versa, or enjoy both."
2401,2020-06-26 14:58:46,hfzzwr,"Appreciate the history and detailed information, thank you!"
2402,2020-06-26 23:04:58,hfzzwr,"Appreciate your opinion and insight, I’ve never shot something designed to roll so it’s good to hear about it and how the grip influences it."
2403,2020-06-26 03:43:50,hfzzwr,"I used to use fake pearl grips but my mother accidentally dropped the gun and the grips shattered and I started using wood ones and I didn't notice any change in the way it fit my hand, just a bit of a grip change because of the texture difference."
2404,2020-06-26 10:36:06,hfzzwr,"Strictly speaking, there's even one more.  If you buy a Vaquero new today, it's technically the ""New Vaquero,"" introduced in 2005.  Before that, the original Vaquero (sometimes called the Old Vaquero or Old Model, though that can cause confusion because of what ""Old Model"" means in other Ruger contexts) used the post-1962 Blackhawk grip frame.  

This original Vaquero grip frame is slightly modified from a true Colt grip, pushing the handle ever so slightly back to give more clearance behind the trigger guard, so it doesn't rap your middle-finger knuckle as hard under recoil.  

The difference is subtle enough that the vast majority of users never even notice it.  But to the really hardcore sixgun nerds, it is the Abomination of Desolation."
2405,2020-06-26 14:52:03,hfzzwr,"Thanks for mentioning that, I forgot to make that distinction. I’m looking at the new Vaqueros. I guess I’ll be wielding an abomination ha.

What confuses me about it, and about poetry in general (sometimes), is this: What makes this a poem? What makes it poetry as opposed to simply a strong statement somebody is making about something? I don't always think this way. Often it's obvious that a piece of writing is a poem rather than something else. Even when I read prose poetry there usually seems to be a language difference between it and less poetic forms of writing. I'm not sure how this one is meant to look on the page but it doesn't seem to be employing any poetic devices for one thing. Not much use of metaphor. The narrative is pretty straightforward. So is it simply the line breaks that make ithis a poem? Genuinely curious."

2424,2020-06-26 18:46:00,hfz498,"This is an interesting question. I think that having super clear divisions between prose & poetry disallows stuff like this to exist, where it's right in the middle. We can dredge up some latin terms for the flow of logic or the contrast between lines & phrases in this piece, but at the end of the day its simply just: the poetry world has accepted writing in this style under its umbrella, so it is poetry. That's just kinda the truth of it.  


And it makes sense to me, because where else would this sort of writing be seen? Political speeches, maybe? But not everyone has that sort of reach. A facebook post or blog isn't ""legitimate"" writing, not really respected in the same way that ""poetry"" is, so I think the scene has absorbed this short rhetorical form as a way to legitimize it, to say hey, we may not have a name for it yet, we cannot analyze and logic the reasons for it yet, but it does have value. 

&#x200B;

The thing you picked up on, that there is poetic language in it, maybe its because poets also write more traditional stuff and it bleeds into this? And if you can be poetic while still being plain, why not? Interesting topic tbh. I'm sure the future will explain us better than we can in the moment."
2425,2020-06-26 20:17:00,hfz498,"What is and isn't a poem is a much less meaningful question to me than ""is this poem any good?"". Take the line breaks out and this is prose. It's significance, originality and depth are somewhere between a reddit comment and a newspaper editorial.

This is just sloppy writing and sloppy thinking. It's entire content could have been put across in a couple of lines and used as a starting point, but no."
2426,2020-06-26 18:59:01,hfz498,"Poetic devices aren’t actually necessary to make a poem. With poetry its not just about reading it. Its about speaking it. Delivery is half of it. For example, if you listen to convenient stores by buddy wakefield, theres lines that are heavily lyrical and lines that are not poetic at all. Also, poetry is extremely diverse. Its easier to identify poetry by if it functions as poetry vs what qualities it contains. So for instance if you saw that written out. Its clearly indented and formated like poetry. Not like prose. Theres no quotation marks. It’s most certainly not an essay or dialogue or anything else. And if you read it out loud, it reads like a poem. And also, we are taught poetry in school like dogshit and modern poets are so much better and advanced than our highschool English teachers. Its possibly harder to recognize it as a poem because some poets are absolute masters and have progressed the art form so far that it bends our notion of what poetry is, while we may have a very narrow understanding of poetry compared to their skill. You ask a good question thats hard to answer. But basically, art is determined by its function. Not its qualities. For example, when you hear people say “rap isnt music” that statement is an absurd indefensible position because if rap isnt music, then how come it functions and behaves and is utilized as music? Rap certainly isn’t a tv show or a book. I can show you film music that in a movie would be most peoples favorite part and its super epic and you listen to the song outside of the movie and its barely even a song, but we recognize it as music despite not sharing many similarities to other music, yet we still clearly recognize it as such"
2427,2020-06-26 21:11:45,hfz498,"Ultimately, the question of ""What is poetry"" is far less interesting than beginning writers think it is. Basically, if the author says it's a poem it's a poem. Without the poet there to say if it is or isn't a poem, the telltale signs are line breaks/atypical prose formatting (no indentation, not double spaced). There aren't hard and fast rules. What's far more important is the writing itself.

The poem is supposed to look like this, [here is where it was originally published in 2019 in Wildness](https://readwildness.com/19/smith-people), it is in tercets. 

When it comes to the poem at hand, it tells its truth, but, as Emily Dickinson commands, he ""tells it slant"". For instance, it begins, well, with the title I guess is the best place to start. Before we start reading the poem proper we know that it will be responding to the situation of someone saying the ""we've made it through worse,"" hollow statement, assumedly during a time of tribulation. So when the poem begins, we know the context of the first stanza. Here's the first 'tell it slant'. The poet doesn't actually hear the wind on graves, that's a metaphor. The poet thinks of those that didn't make it through, the 'exceptions' which are far from exceptions. There are real dead, and those hollow statements ring especially true when you think of that. Like, when people say that about Covid-19 I think about what happened that one time almost 3000 Americans died, yet 15k in a week during April people shrug and say a similar sentiment. ""We'll get through it""... except for all those dead people. 

In this instance, it appears to be more likely to be war that the poet is talking about, judging by the confetti and parade (and later he evokes the actual word war). But, like they say about the iceberg, the poet doesn't say everything. He gives the details that at the end of 'this' there is confetti and a parade, leaving the connecting of dots to the reader—while of course not exclusive to poetry, this sort of leaving the reader to connect the dots writing is more indicative of poetry than prose. Then the poet returns to the title, calling out the hollowness of the words used to placate people, to soothe disquiet etc. Don't worry about it. And the poet is saying, ""No, worry about it. Look at it, not what you want to believe will be true."" 

The poet invokes the 'moral arc' in a sort of 'what is' fashion, saying, essentially, that life isn't as fair as we want it to be. It can be shitty and people that we don't think should die sometimes die, and that if you don't look at it you'll never have any agency to change the 'moral arc' or, what is. That's the address to the reader. The poem had gotten a little nihilistic, but the poet makes the poem 'turn' there, and this is another thing indicative of it being a poem. This is a pretty classic placement of the ['volta'](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/learn/glossary-terms/volta), in a Petrarchan sonnet the turn is 2/3 through the poem (after the octave, before the sestet), and here it's indeed at the same place, after the 4th of 6 stanzas. 

The rest is pretty straight forward but, yeah, straightforward is definitely at home in contemporary poetry ([Here's a Ted Kooser poem called ""Wood Chips""](https://www.rattle.com/wood-chips-by-ted-kooser/) from Rattle last year also that I very much enjoyed which is pretty straightforward in its language). It's also very carefully phrased, so while straightforward, it's also not what we'd call 'flat', or, not overly flat. I hope that helps. I gotta get back to work lol."
2428,2020-06-26 21:35:41,hfz498,"I see where you're coming from. I have diagnosed ADD and when my eyes find a section of text, the spacing is extremely important to how I parse the information.

The spacing is a very important part of what makes a poem."

2430,2020-06-26 14:33:12,hfz498,"No worries, not everyone needs to like it, but to answer your question I liked it because of the visual imagery it evokes (wind slapping against gravestones, confetti falling). I also particularly like the line ""Sometimes the moral arc of the universe does not bend in a direction that will comfort us/ Sometimes it bends in ways we don't expect and people will fall off the process."" What impressed me the most about the poem is that it's essentially about the persona losing hope, and yet somehow at the end of reading it I feel like the persona is actually more hopeful because of how they have come to peace with their fate."
2431,2020-06-26 16:36:03,hfz498,">You could state the whole poem in four lines.

You can do the same thing for virtually any Frost poem, for instance. Or Ted Kooser or Gary Snyder or... virtually anything can be stated in a simplified manner, that doesn't make it less of a poem. Later you mention ghazals, which to me are (at least in English) incredibly recursive and often bleh. Also, Ghalib died some time ago, not sure if you've heard, and in the intervening 90ish years, surprise surprise, poetry has changed. You know why? Because readers of poetry had already read those poems. When you're constrained by meter and rhyme in a rhyme-poor language like English, you're bound to either break free from the arbitrary shackles holding back your poems, or you start writing the same fucking poems over and over again. But that's all intro to poetry stuff.

As far as this poem goes, I'm awfully curious to see your line critiques, as in, not just generalized shit talk. What lines in particular did you not like and why not, or was it the general scope of the poem? To aid your reading, here is how the poem is supposed to appear in tercets, as it was when it was published at Wildess last year.

[When people say,“we have made it through worse before” by Clint Smith](https://readwildness.com/19/smith-people)

It's kind of ironic that you criticized the piece in a shallow fashion because it is precisely about people shallowly dealing with real life, specifically, using the optimistic phrase ""we have made it through worse before"" to sugarcoat awful situations without confronting them. *Oh, we've had worse, don't worry your pretty little head*. But there is plenty of reason to worry, people are dying. And the poet is telling the reader to not be lulled by aphorisms and sayings into thinking that just because it isn't the apocalypse that one shouldn't be worried about... whatever it happens to be at the time. I think the poem is a very good indictment of shallow positive thinking at the expense of a better outcome/result had the unpleasant been approached/confronted head-on. 

So, I'd like to hear more about what you disliked about the poem, because I'm not seeing it, unless it's the standard beginning reader of poetry's complaint about free verse not being memorable or as powerful as rhymed poems. You know, what usually goes away after that freshman level poetry class."

I'm assuming the opening of my response turned you off and it went downhill from there, but you asked what makes it a poem and not prose. I explained places in the poem that were indicative of poetry (after beginning with there being no hard and fast rules, and linking the poem in its proper form). What was off topic for you? More importantly, what was *inaccurate*? 

The idea of ""What is poetry"" is extremely well-trod ground and the answer is always nebulous and vague because poetry is extremely varied. 

I will quote what I said about the volta for you so you can give it another go.

I suppose I could have used an emdash instead of a colon, but in a six stanza poem, where would the 2/3 mark be? Volta is not a term exclusively used in sonnets. Here's the first few words from the Poetry Foundation link I used:

> Italian word for “turn.” In a sonnet, 

The period, indicating that's the meaning, the next sentence giving an example. If it helps, here's the first sentence from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volta_(literature)), it makes it a little more clear:

> In [poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry), the **volta**, or **turn**, is a [rhetorical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric) shift or dramatic change in thought and/or emotion. Turns are seen in all types of written poetry. 

I made that first post in good faith, trying to give some poetry insight to someone asking quite literally ""what makes this a poem"", and you call it presumptuous, pretentious, say I'm trying to impress people with a term you mistakenly think I misused, so now I'm holding back the snark best I can because I like talking poetry and not snipping back and forth... why are people getting so heated in a poetry thread? Jeez Louise."
2442,2020-06-26 16:15:58,hfz498,To me Ghalib’s ghazals and shayaris are beautiful and so is this poem. I can’t compare these two and I am no good in explaining why I love this poem.
2443,2020-06-26 16:39:48,hfz498,"Do you bemoan short films for being short? Or still photographs for not having movement? ""Belaboured and obvious"" is interesting phrasing, because it's bland enough that it could be applied to virtually any poem and chalked up to taste. One could lob that accusation at anything they wanted to without any understanding of the thing they're complaining about. If you like long go read Don Juan. But it's pretty silly to say this poem sucks, I like long poems this is short. Short poems suck. It feels like the sort of statement that is followed by a stamping of feet and maybe the slamming of a bedroom door."
2444,2020-06-26 18:11:59,hfz498,"Those linebreaks are awkward, and they deflate the meaning of the words entirely, all for a single syllable rhyme? And one of them even repeated. Rhyming me with me? Also, I think you're misinterpreting what the poet's saying about the moral arc—It is invoking the mysterious universe, the inability to find reason in an existence with cause but not purpose.

I think you would benefit from taking a poetry class, because your opinions seem woefully out of touch and your reading skills (as demonstrated by your comments and this 'after' attempt, could use a refresher too. Hey, no shame in taking a class if you enjoy the subject). The capitalization of enjambed lines in your summary is also a bit outdated, though the occasional poet will still do it, usually one in their 70s.

A couple places where your version falls short, for instance, the gravestones are not missing the confetti, the dead whose graves they mark are. The dead are the important part, not the marker. The marker denotes that they not only didn't make some arbitrary goal, they didn't continue living. And they ARE hopeless words. They're worthless, in fact, worse than worthless, they're harmful. They lull people into complacency when they should be raging. Your version kind of shows either that you just disagree with the conceit of the poem, or you aren't following the poem's movements as closely as you think you are."
2445,2020-06-26 17:51:05,hfz498,">It's also philosophically weak, either the moral arc of the universe is truth, or it's not. 

What exactly do you mean by this? I don't think the poem is contemplating whether or not the moral arc of the universe *is* truth - it's contemplating *which* truth people choose to believe in - is it the truth that the universe will always be on their side, or the truth that sometimes it isn't? The poem is choosing to live by the latter one as their truth.

Also, I think your four-line poem is great! However, if I was forced to choose I would still stick with the original one above because your poem's tone feels much more cheerful to me (just my opinion, not necessarily objective observation) - the original one sounds much more somber to me, and I like that more.  Also, a lot of the nuance is taken away. In your poem, the following are not so clear to me compared to the original: 

\- that the persona has lived their whole life being told to ""look on the bright side"", and that they've gone on this entire journey of lying to themselves too before finally realizing accepting the negative can also be freeing

\- that they believe the future is still worth fighting for, in spite of all this

\- that this can be a collective experience (""we"" and ""us"" are used much more in the original, here it's only ""I"")

\- the imagery of war and being haunted towards the end (really makes you feel how tired of the world the persona is)

&#x200B;

Still, poetry is poetry and it comes in so many forms, some people like some forms and dislike others. It's great that you're actually trying to understand why people appreciate something you don't"

>the conceit of the poem, or you aren't following the poem's movements as closely as you think you are.

I am, I just think it leave me cold.  There is no real conceit, all these things are obvious. If I'd thought about it a bit more than about thirty seconds, I would have changed a few things in my sample to refelect a bit more nuance. But I am  messing about."

A feat, for sure, I applaud it, but it doesn't make your understanding of poetry any better. The jab at MFAs is another tell about your opinion contemporary poetry, and that you likely don't read much of it. 

You keep saying obvious, but when you try to sum it up in your version of verse, you miss the majority of the poem's meaning, so I guess I'll just have to wait the 'few days' for your response. 

Meter and rhyme are 100% a constraint, in the manner that most mean it—ie. *regular*. Words are the paint, their arrangement the application of that paint. Writing in a certain rhythm is like only working on one size canvas. The world needs murals and comics as well, in my opinion. 

Also, you missed the point about English being rhyme poor—we're talking about poetry in English. It doesn't have anything to do with translation, again, you didn't read carefully. But hey, it's reddit, all just chattin' with strangers for fun. Have a good day."

And he lectures me on reading poetry.

I don't think it's rhyme poor at all. 

I didn't say it has anything to do with translation. I said they bare understand it in the original language, or the form, or the use of it, or the place of it. Or how you should breath when performing it."

I know this team inside and out. They are looking to supplement what they have. And since they have limited ways to improve financially it's likely they use their draft pick to fill a need. A few things they'll be targeting...

A big wing who can defend big wings. A low offensive usage connective tissue type of guy who help connect the high usage players on the roster and make lineups flow better. Possibly a stretch 5. Athleticism. Defense.

A few guys in particular that I think they'll have their eye on...

Jalen Smith, Aleksej Pokusevski, Precious Achiuwa, Paul Reed, Saddiq Bey, Tyler Bey, Xavier Tillman, Zeke Nnaji. If they go guard then Devon Dotson is a possible target because his play style fits the Jazz scheme so well."

I'm a little concerned about Ramsey's decision-making and very concerned about his defensive IQ, but I can definitely see him going in the first if a team really buys the athleticism and shooting combo (maybe the Knicks at 27?). He's also not a good enough shooter off movement or off the dribble imo to bet on him as a 3pt specialist when Isaiah Joe is right there and is just better at so many things in my view.

Idk if ""imbalance"" is the right word but his legs are like almost too strong lol. He put on a lot of muscle in his legs in the last year or so and I think if he could trim down a little, it might help his lateral mobility. He really isn't a wing currently because I'm not sure if he's a fluid enough mover to guard guys on the perimeter, but if he could improve his lateral movement, he might be able to guard 2-4, and when coupled with his rim protection, he might be an incredible defender."
2520,2020-06-26 00:42:59,hfs60u,"drafting ball is just going to stall everyone’s development. garland and ball can’t be on the floor together, zero defense. Sexton needs the ball, KPJ needs the ball. you throw lamelo in there and that’s another guy who needs the ball and hurts everybody. 

Sexton looked amazing the second half of the year, KPJ is the best kept secret in the league, and garland moves the way an elite point guard moves (very similar to Brandon Ingram. Ingram looked amazing but the ball just wouldn’t go in). you need to get a guy like wiseman who can play defense bc right now they’re learning bad habits bc of how bad the team defense. 

lamelo isn’t that good of a prospect"
2521,2020-06-25 21:17:37,hfs60u,"Wiseman has an insanely high ceiling, arguably higher than Ball."
2522,2020-06-25 23:17:06,hfs60u,"Yeah I agree I definitely went back and forth on it. I would imagine the most likely move for Cleveland if they get #2 is to trade back, which makes sense to me. I think for some, Wiseman is justifiable at 2 because they see him as one of the better big man prospects over the past decade and a potential franchise changer, but I certainly don't view him that way."
2523,2020-06-26 08:48:48,hfs60u,Ball on that team will be a circus a core of 4 guards I’m sure ball will do everything not to get drafted by the cavs . No offense
2524,2020-06-25 22:59:46,hfs60u,"I would love to trade up as well. Killian Hayes would be my first choice by I'd be ecstatic for Cole Anthony or Tyrese Maxey as well, as we really need bench scoring. But Poku might not be a draft and stash; I think I saw something that he kinda wants to come over immediately, and if you can develop him properly, which I have faith that the Celtics will, you might end up with one of the top players in this draft when it's all said and done. Because the Celtics roster is already fairly well built, they can afford to take a high-upside gamble. And for Bolmaro, getting him at 26 is great value in my view, as I see him as a borderline lotto talent with some of the best upside in the class. These guys aren't Yabusele and Zizic. They have pretty high ceilings."
2525,2020-06-25 23:02:19,hfs60u,"Yeah he could very realistically go higher since that area from the late lotto to the early 20s isn't great in terms of reliable talent. I love the fit with Philly but New Orleans, Dallas, and Milwaukee could also be awesome. I guess in that case if I'm the Sixers I might look at Malachi Flynn at 22, even though that's pretty early for him, as that's also a great fit for their roster."
2526,2020-06-25 23:25:55,hfs60u,"Yeah that makes sense. I figured it's worth it to take the guard there because there's a sizeable drop-off in my view after Riller, Dotson, Mannion, and Jones, whereas you could possibly get a solid big man toward the end of the draft. I like Wesson, but they just as easily could have gone with Simonović for example, or go small with someone like Pons. If they grab a big in the first, they're probably left with like Pritchard, Powell, and Howard, and just don't think those guys are worth drafting. Also I think Riller is comfortably ahead of both Dotson and Jones. Jones doesn't really do anything special he's just a solid backup who plays good defense. A lot of Dotson's strengths are also Riller's strengths (specifically attacking the rim and finishing), and if anything, Riller is farther along in terms of those strengths and is just more likely to be a good pro."
2527,2020-06-26 13:01:50,hfs60u,"Who would you look at instead? I've seen Toppin to the Wolves a few times and I think that's a terrible fit. They might work offensively, but that is a disastrous defensive frontcourt. They won't be able to guard anyone. I've also seen Okongwu there, but I don't like that fit either. Part of the value of KAT is that he's as skilled as he is offensively for a center; by making him effectively play PF, I think you lose some of the advantages that he creates on the offensive end, plus I'm not sure if either Okongwu or KAT would be maximized defensively playing the 4. So you're basically either reaching for a wing (Deni, Vassell, Okoro) or taking another guard that probably doesn't fit super well with D'Lo, like Hayes. I'd rather just take the upside in Ball and move him later if you really want to."
2528,2020-06-25 22:59:03,hfs60u,"I wrote an essay about him and whenever you ask I can add more. Here you are (from the 3rd Paragraph). Anyway, I would take him between 20-30.

2529,2020-06-26 00:48:20,hfs60u,"There’s no way we re-sign both sexton and garland

I’m pretty high on garland too, I think he could play off ball due to his shooting

I think Collin could easily become a top 6th man getting 30 minutes and averaging 20

I think either can play with Ball

I have always loved big playmakers so I could be wrong on ball, what don’t you like? His form is off but he doesn’t have lonzo’s sweep which defenders just sit on and have kept him from shooting well in the nba, his playmaking is Rubio at least, his floater is really good and he can shoot it from outside the lane"
2530,2020-06-25 22:11:33,hfs60u,"I'm really high on Wiseman, I think he can be DeAndre Jordan with a jump shot which IMO would be a HOF level player.

I just think that Ball is more setup for success (depending on measurements big diff from a 6'5 PG and a 6'8 PG imo) as his handle, passing, and floater all set him up for a really great floor and if his jumper comes around (his range is already impressive, just his consistency) he could be a superstar"
2531,2020-06-26 14:31:04,hfs60u,"NBA players don’t refuse to go to teams, can’t remember the last time that happened, if he’s there and the Cavs want him he’ll be a cav 

The Cavs have had the worst record in the league the past two years, you don’t draft for fit in a terrible team you draft for talent"
2532,2020-06-27 17:53:30,hfs60u,"I'd rather take RJ Hampton than Poku with the MEM pick. He's a project too, but I like his chances of becoming something more than I do Poku, who I don't think will ever be physical enough to play at the NBA level. If he's around at 26 or 30, I'd be less opposed to swinging for him. Bolmaro would be a perfect stash guy for the Cs, but I'd rather take Jalen Smith in that 26 spot. Think he can be like another Theis. If they did go with Bolmaro at 26 though, I'd want Nnaji over Tillman I think. Grant Williams already does what Tillman does, but better. Nnaji has good size, runs the floor really well, and has nice touch. Needs to improve defensively, but Boston would be the perfect system for that. 

Good work on this overall though."
2533,2020-06-25 23:10:37,hfs60u,"Flynn is interesting, would rather wait on him in the 2nd round though. just want a guard that can dribble, pass and shoot. novel concepts for sixers guards"
2534,2020-06-25 23:31:16,hfs60u,"I'm just not a big Riller fan due to his non existent defence and subpar playmaking for a point guard. Dotson and Jones are both superior in those areas and Dotson is similar offensively (I believe he can shoot and that his bad 3 pt % this year is just poor sample size.)

At the end of the 2nd they could also go with Sam Merrill, who while an older guard, can at least fill out the backup PG role with his all around play and good shooting. Or they could just not pick a PG at all and select a wing to back up Anunoby next year. The Raps believe Davis can be a point guard so they may just stay away from that position this year."
2535,2020-06-26 02:45:42,hfs60u,With as much enthusiasm I've seen you have for this guy you could probably make a pretty good post on this sub analyzing him.
2536,2020-06-26 00:50:17,hfs60u,you can’t possibly know that. they’re going to resign sexton so that’s 3 years of them together at least

2556,2020-06-25 18:57:26,hfruhb,"I’m going to disregard the McCarthy howler and bad ball from PEH for a moment and talk about the rest of the game.

Southampton’s did a decent job pressing throughout out the game. The subs of KWP and Long were needed. Long’s play is ideal for Ings as support. KWP was very comfortable on the ball, sat back when needed, and made quality runs. He deserves the starts going forward; if he shows quality, pull the trigger in a swap plus money deal for PEH. Obafemi looked gassed at the 30’ mark and Valery plays way too high with no ability to clear a ball. I’m not high on Obafemi as a striker partner with Ings. Valery needs a loan. 

Since we’re less than 1% relegation at the moment, the result isn’t ideal but doesn’t hurt.

Now for McCarthy and PEH. WTF. Stephens made his best play on the ball. 

We need a result against Watford; looks like PEH is injured so I’m looking at a 4-1-3-2 Romeu sitting in front of Bednarek/Vestergaard with Redmond/JWP/Armstrong. Once we’re officially out of relegation, Gunn will start the rest of the season."
2557,2020-06-25 19:03:18,hfruhb,Holding was solid good game from him. Bellerin awful. A lot of people are quick to shit on Pepe because of his price tag but honestly the way we're set up and him having Bellerin on the right doesn't help him produce anything at all. It's literally like we are allergic to use the right side of the pitch. It's also a bit concerning that outside of the Auba chance and Ederson esque pass from Martinez how little we create and can't kill off a game quickly. We also need to work on counter attacks we've had countless since Arteta came in and have fucked them all.

This was classic Hojbjerg. More than happy to bounce around on his toes making simple passes under no pressure, being a great #captain and 'intelligent', 'classy' midfielder, but when it actually comes to DOING something  to change the outcome of a game, he just can't do it. Armstrong and Prowse are far ahead of him. What exactly are Spurs interested in? It's all manufactured by his agent. He will fit in well there.

2578,2020-06-25 19:07:29,hfruhb,"Here are my ratings for the game. 

No one was amazing but just about good

Saka - 8 MOTM for me. High on energy, techniques, position and confidence. 

Holding - 7.5 Was solid today. Shades of his past self before the injury. 

Mustafi -7.5 - Solid. Hardly any foot wrong. Rhat yellow card was a dofus decision by the referee.

Martinez- 7 -  couple of sharp saves. Good with the feet. Decent distribution. Except a couple of times when he long passed the ball out. 

Bellerin -4 - Has a long way to go to be the great prospect, he once was thought of. 

Tierney - Sharp player. I see good things in future.

Ceballos - 4 - Just as insipid as Bellerin. Creative player, my ass, this game.

Xhaka - 7- Nothing amazing. Did his job. Ticking like a metronome. A couple of excellent through balls that could have cause more problems, but didn't. Not his fault.

Auba - 7 - Sharp as ever in his positioning and runs. Not so sharp with passes and goals. Didn't look as enthusiastic. ( thinking of Transfer?)

Nketiah-7- Got the goal. Very lively on pitch. High energy and physical play. Not so much on techniques. Much to learn, young padawan.

Pepe -5 - Bleh from him today. Left his pace and trickery shoes at home today. Still a prospect."

Over 90 minutes, without considering the mistakes at the back, you'd probably say Southampton were the better side, but I'll take it.

I think we can play better, but we really need to build some confidence. It doesn't help when Bellerin plays as badly as he did today, though. Having Granit back is such an upgrade over Guendouzi he really nits things together well. If he could just cut out the mistakes and a few risky passes he would be one of the better DLP in the league.

2620,2020-06-25 18:57:23,hfruhb,"Think it was a fair result tbh, very low intensity after the hour mark"
2621,2020-06-25 19:04:58,hfruhb,Darn. No fan tv tonight
2622,2020-06-25 18:57:36,hfruhb,Best I've heard all year!
2623,2020-06-25 18:58:25,hfruhb,"Plant some trees, mate."
2624,2020-06-25 19:03:10,hfruhb,Come back from the gym. Take a breather.
2625,2020-06-25 19:06:25,hfruhb,"Buy an umbrella, it seems like good luck for us"
2626,2020-06-25 19:02:01,hfruhb,We're doing our part!
2627,2020-06-25 19:04:21,hfruhb,"Well after Brighton PaddyPower promised to plant 6000 trees every time Arsenal don’t win. 

Seems like Arsenal players are motivated to help the environment as little as possible"
2628,2020-06-25 19:00:29,hfruhb,"Bellerin really tried his hardest to ensure we were tree-less but alas, 3000 trees!"
2629,2020-06-25 21:10:23,hfruhb,Tell em loud. Tell em proud.
2630,2020-06-25 18:58:01,hfruhb,At home
2631,2020-06-25 20:08:38,hfruhb,And I thought the Leicester game was embarrassing jeez
2632,2020-06-25 19:12:50,hfruhb,Imagine only winning 2-0 at St Mary’s when gifted 2 goals
2633,2020-06-25 19:00:36,hfruhb,"Helped arteta get his first away win

Edit: in PL"
2634,2020-06-25 19:28:42,hfruhb,He had an insane save when Auba came thru alone and hit the bar.
2635,2020-06-25 19:07:58,hfruhb,"Reckon you should give him a massive raise, came through big for you there"
2636,2020-06-25 18:58:15,hfruhb,"Said it before the match, the bookies had us as favorites over Arsenal. We had much more momentum coming into the game. We were always gonna bottle this one."
2637,2020-06-25 19:58:01,hfruhb,R/soccer cares way more about memes than actual football.
2638,2020-06-25 21:32:01,hfruhb,Same thing with us when we were in our shit period.
2639,2020-06-25 19:02:53,hfruhb,Ceballos was so good in his first game for us. Really sad how things worked out.
2640,2020-06-25 19:03:48,hfruhb,"I'm starting to believe Ceballos does not know how to play a ball forward, so many times today Auba is making a forward run and screaming for the ball and Ceballos cuts back and plays it sideways, its infuriating to watch."
2641,2020-06-25 18:59:23,hfruhb,That missed chance was rough and i love how he keeps trying to assist Eddie.
2642,2020-06-25 19:02:47,hfruhb,So true even when his teammates fluffs chances or don’t pass him the ball he never answers with a negative reaction. The young players at Arsenal should and will certainly learn a lot from him.
2643,2020-06-25 18:59:55,hfruhb,"He even squares the ball alot of times instead of taking the shot, god i love this man."
2644,2020-06-25 19:55:12,hfruhb,"Nobody should be behind Willock. Obviously he got his goal today which was nice, but in the normal run of play he hides from the ball."
2645,2020-06-25 19:01:11,hfruhb,Man is too important. We suck with him and without him it is even worse.
2646,2020-06-25 19:06:42,hfruhb,Saka? But Saka plays literally the entire left side of the field without a position it seems like. Ceballos tho.... Dear lord
2647,2020-06-25 22:19:48,hfruhb,Why is that sad? The bloke is a tidy footballer.
2648,2020-06-25 19:06:11,hfruhb,ARSENAL ARE BACK
2649,2020-06-25 19:06:46,hfruhb,AND 3000 TREES MOTHERFUCKER
2650,2020-06-25 19:07:43,hfruhb,"Wake up klemazz, ings has just bagged his 5th"
2651,2020-06-25 19:06:42,hfruhb,"Alexa, play Chris Brown’s “Don’t wake me up.”"
2652,2020-06-25 18:57:38,hfruhb,r/soccer: I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that
2653,2020-06-25 18:58:29,hfruhb,"I doubt any of those were serious, thing is tho that reddit, and especially this sub, has a unique talent of running jokes into the ground"
2654,2020-06-25 19:07:04,hfruhb,"Nonsense brother, champions League looking more like a proposition by the minute"
2655,2020-06-25 18:58:05,hfruhb,"Come on man those comments aren't fully serious, just a hyperbolic reaction to a club truly in a crisis"
2656,2020-06-25 18:58:01,hfruhb,"Yeah teams can still win games when they're playing shit, just look at Newcastle."
2657,2020-06-25 19:01:28,hfruhb,Southampton was pretty solid. We were a bit fortunate for once and that was ultimately what decided the game. Good luck for the rest of the season.
2658,2020-06-25 19:14:53,hfruhb,"I'd say you were comfortably the better side after the first 15/20 mins. 

I expected you to run out of puff after pressing in that heat. Surprised to see the energy towards the end. 

The intricate play in front of a packed defence is stil not really good. Should have tried to blast a few more shots, and cross often and early.

IMO, you're using KWP wrong, there was no need for him to be so conservative and laying the ball off to Ward-Prowse all the time. It gave Arsenal the chance to reset every time. KWP is a perfectly good crosser.

He looked a bit nervous but in time he'll get there."
2659,2020-06-25 19:00:40,hfruhb,"I might be biased, but I think walker peters doesn’t do anything whenever I watch him. It’s like he tries deliberately to not make an impact. Kind of weak as well."
2660,2020-06-25 19:08:36,hfruhb,A good / decent midfield is much more important than defence imo. We fuck up so many counterattacks due to our midfield. When Xhaka is our best then you should know we are missing something.
2661,2020-06-26 02:46:50,hfruhb,This is probably why Arteta plays Sokratis as RB
2662,2020-06-25 19:11:01,hfruhb,"Lol. 3000 times, I am sure. 


Unless you hate that girl, then I am not laughing at your jome."
2663,2020-06-25 19:16:47,hfruhb,"> Stephens

That was on Hojberg. What a stupid pass."
2664,2020-06-25 21:02:42,hfruhb,"Honestly to me, he's one of those players where it's like 50/50, he stays at the club and becomes a key midfielder, or he's the next Anelka / Nasri / etc. and we just take the first big money offer we get for him because of his attitude. He clearly has a lot of potential and especially last season, before we collapsed, he was a very key player in midfield, but it's also not a good sign when your manager has left you out of the squad twice in the span of a few months for different attitude-related problems."
2665,2020-06-25 18:59:10,hfruhb,The real Project Restart.
2666,2020-06-25 19:27:51,hfruhb,There's a top 10 trophy right?
2667,2020-06-25 19:07:33,hfruhb,Oh lawd they comin
2668,2020-06-26 00:49:28,hfruhb,Even I think Auba might leave. Btw bleh from Pepe today because he hardly got service from bellerin.
2669,2020-06-25 19:03:23,hfruhb,Nope :(
2670,2020-06-25 19:05:10,hfruhb,Not yet
2671,2020-06-25 19:14:24,hfruhb,"Just because Paddy Power threatened us with their plan to plant 6,000."
2672,2020-06-26 02:14:09,hfruhb,"Tierney was tucked in almost in a back five. Looked pretty tidy. Didn't really step wrong, but had a strain and got switched off with Kolasinac.

As the joke went: you felt sorry for the lad, playing in that heat as a Scotsman."
2673,2020-06-25 19:09:49,hfruhb,City ripped you off
2674,2020-06-25 18:59:15,hfruhb,"He is an average midfielder. Therefore he is our best.

&#x200B;

Way too important."
2675,2020-06-25 19:02:06,hfruhb,He’s our only midfielder who I can trust to put in a 6/10 at the moment. It’s pretty grim
2676,2020-06-26 02:00:31,hfruhb,"If Xhaka works well why is it such a bad thing?

We play so much better with him on the pitch"
2677,2020-06-25 19:42:34,hfruhb,"I really like Xhaka but I'm so excited for him to hopefully no longer be our best midfielder. Our midfield looks so much better with him in it, imagine him paired with someone better? It's sad our midfield is in such shambles that anyone better than Xhaka instantly improves it."
2678,2020-06-25 19:10:02,hfruhb,"Eh that's kind of true but who else can play that role in the midfield? A bit tough to ask essentially three 8's (ceballos, willock, guen) to provide the structure that xhaka brings when that's not their skill set in the slightest."
2679,2020-06-25 18:59:19,hfruhb,Honestly I thought we played better against Brighton at least going forwards.
2680,2020-06-25 19:02:14,hfruhb,"I have to be honest, you guys were alright at best, but maybe that's due to the weather and overall fitness levels."
2681,2020-06-25 19:56:12,hfruhb,"Saka looks like someone who can progress midfield to attack, especially with Tierney & Auba (Martinelli) too staying on the left"
2682,2020-06-25 18:58:34,hfruhb,Back to 9th.
2683,2020-06-25 18:58:12,hfruhb,That won’t work again top half side
2684,2020-06-25 18:58:52,hfruhb,"Honestly I went to the Saint Mary's to see them get battered by Chelsea and it was the deadest crowd I've ever seen at a game, even when it was 0-0 or 1-1"
2685,2020-06-25 18:59:24,hfruhb,They didn't let up for a second. What an atmosphere.
2686,2020-06-25 19:36:11,hfruhb,Alex McCarthy - Environmentalists LOVE him!
2687,2020-06-25 19:04:43,hfruhb,He just wanted Paddy Power to do all the work with 6000!
2688,2020-06-25 19:01:39,hfruhb,we lose to everyone at home
2689,2020-06-25 19:13:33,hfruhb,We won at Fratton Park in the cup in March.
2690,2020-06-25 19:04:45,hfruhb,This was Arsenal's first away win under him!?? Damn.
2691,2020-06-25 19:05:02,hfruhb,"I had us losing 2-1 in the nbc predictor app. Whenever I have us winning we lose, so it seemed the obvious choice at the time."
2692,2020-06-25 20:49:46,hfruhb,Last season all the talk around Christmas time was your terrible run of form. Hadn't won in 12 games. A few of our players on hotstreaks and a good run of games. I remember saying to my mate this is all perfectly set up for us to botch this game. End result Southampton 3 Arsenal 2.
2693,2020-06-25 21:11:57,hfruhb,"Things r/soccer loves in order of best to least - muh FM saves, memes, pulisic"
2694,2020-06-25 21:55:27,hfruhb,Memes = Dreams
2695,2020-06-25 19:12:36,hfruhb,Wouldn't really say he was so good. Probably a case of us getting overly excited. He was tidy in his first game but he hasn't had any lights out performances.
2696,2020-06-25 19:06:16,hfruhb,Or tries his stupid Cruyff turn and gives up possesion
2697,2020-06-25 21:18:07,hfruhb,"I recommend for your mental well being that you avoid watching our national team play if that bothers you.

Sometimes I want to run onto the pitch and just cunt it upfield."
2698,2020-06-25 20:06:39,hfruhb,"God fuck off mate, Rambo had the same issue, should we have binned him as well? Willock has shown a lot of positives, plenty to still believe in him. His nose for goals, use of his body and exploding runs bringing the ball forward, all shows the potential of a great player. That doesn’t mean he shouldn’t get better at getting involved with games and making the right decision in the final third, but it’s no reason to give up on him, he’s showing plenty of promise and is still only 20"
2699,2020-06-25 19:16:36,hfruhb,"Saka's both young and not a proper midfielder. Ceballos idk what's with him, maybe England doesn't suit him or maybe just that we suck and he can't shine (or maybe a bit of both), but he's basically the definition of bang average."
2700,2020-06-26 01:55:34,hfruhb,Sakas not really the midfield
2701,2020-06-25 22:23:34,hfruhb,"Because just a few years ago our midfield options were Cazorla, Ramsey, a not yet dogshit Özil, or if you wanna go back a couple more years, Fabregas, Rosicky, Arteta etc.

Xhaka's alright but nothing special, and the club should be aiming higher than meh."
2702,2020-06-25 19:23:27,hfruhb,Until the next game
2703,2020-06-25 18:59:23,hfruhb,unsubscribed
2704,2020-06-25 19:04:55,hfruhb,you just know they are gonna get ahead of us the last matchday giving the twats something to cheer for
2705,2020-06-25 19:10:27,hfruhb,The sub is now hunting for the next team to fuck up majorly - you’re up Chelsea / Liverpool
2706,2020-06-25 19:13:50,hfruhb,"they were serious though, it wasnt common but comments were certainly made to that effect, just delusional shite that dont deserve any kind of benefit of the doubt"
2707,2020-06-25 20:07:51,hfruhb,Harry Kane 9 season wonder LOL!
2708,2020-06-25 19:00:14,hfruhb,"I think those people are in a minority, but they definitely exist - look at the daily discussion threads recently, people just need more perspective, too often teams are shit when they lose and brilliant when they win"
2709,2020-06-25 19:04:35,hfruhb,You must not have been watching Valery. He's wayyyy better two way than Valery which only knows how to go forward. RB is the biggest position we need to address. People shit on Cedric but he was serviceable and consistent. He'll do well as a backup to Bellerin.
2710,2020-06-25 19:03:41,hfruhb,"I thought that too, would rather take the easy option and lay it off than actually contribute. Nothing player"
2711,2020-06-25 19:17:55,hfruhb,"Yeah agreed, edited."
2712,2020-06-25 21:24:05,hfruhb,I think he will be sold this Summer for £30M-ish. Money will be used to fund Partey + a starting CB (along with other sales)
2713,2020-06-25 23:02:49,hfruhb,Every Arsenal game since the restart has resulted in the fewest possible trees being planted.
2714,2020-06-25 19:01:18,hfruhb,for what its worth i quite like him as a player but we can't be so reliant on him
2715,2020-06-25 19:01:00,hfruhb,"I thought we were better against Brighton too.

But I think the result has shaped the discussion more so than the performance."
2716,2020-06-26 02:03:23,hfruhb,"People judge attacking play a lot more than they do defensive

We went up much earlier on in the Saints game so we needed to attack less and sat back waiting for the counter.

Whereas at Brighton we were going for the goal all match and were knackered by the time we got the goal which meant our defending was worse"
2717,2020-06-25 19:12:31,hfruhb,I agree. They gifted is the game. Especially their GK.
2718,2020-06-25 19:08:30,hfruhb,Definitely think Southampton would have gotten a draw if not for the howler of a passback. Arsenal hardly had a look in second half.
2719,2020-06-25 19:00:07,hfruhb,"we’ve got the most toxic atmosphere in the Prem and it’s not even close, there’s a reason we’re brilliant on the road and the worst team in the league at home"
2720,2020-06-25 19:11:04,hfruhb,"Our fans are massively depressed about our club - as soon as the first misplaced pass is made the fans start complaining about every little thing - away games are totally different, the chants go all match basically, shame that doesn't transcend to St Mary's"
2721,2020-06-26 12:13:49,hfruhb,I did some work experience at a sports data company once and they found Southampton had some of the most fickle fans in England. The correlation between results and season ticket sales was very strong compared to Brentford who could sell regardless of results.
2722,2020-06-25 23:09:13,hfruhb,I fucking hate our fans
2723,2020-06-25 19:02:44,hfruhb,They really stuck it too Martinez when he was taking long on a goal kick too.
2724,2020-06-25 19:06:17,hfruhb,we've only had like 4 or 5 wins haha
2725,2020-06-25 19:06:31,hfruhb,In Premier League yes.
2726,2020-06-25 20:09:29,hfruhb,"I mean, he hasn't been coaching Arsenal for THAT long and he didn't inherit the greatest team."
2727,2020-06-26 01:53:26,hfruhb,"We didn't have very many away matches in the prem after he came in

Everton. D

Bournemouth D

Palace D

Chelsea D (with another Luiz red card in the 26th fucking minute)

Burnley, D

(then City and Brighton after the break)

We won away at Portsmouth, Olympiakos, and Bournemouth in all comps"
2728,2020-06-25 19:09:09,hfruhb,You are the curse.
2729,2020-06-25 21:50:19,hfruhb,*rubs hands vigorously*
2730,2020-06-25 22:55:59,hfruhb,">FM saves, memes, Pulisic. In that order.

&#x200B;

FTFY"
2731,2020-06-25 20:11:11,hfruhb,"The performance in his first game against Burnly was absolutely outstanding, I don’t know what you’re on about"
2732,2020-06-25 20:12:23,hfruhb,He was really good against burnley early in the season
2733,2020-06-25 19:10:37,hfruhb,"Honestly when he lost the ball in our half of the pitch in the first half, I truly expected Southampton to score. I dont see why we extended his loan to the end of the season, we have other midfielders that could do with the minutes."
2734,2020-06-25 20:18:11,hfruhb,"Did I say we should give up and sell him? No, but he's clearly not ready for the premier league. he never shows for the ball. He needs to go gain some confidence playing someplace where it won't feel like we're playing with 10 men for most of the time he's on the pitch."
2735,2020-06-25 19:23:26,hfruhb,I mean Saka quite literally plays in the midfield right now
2736,2020-06-26 02:48:00,hfruhb,What position did he line up as today
2737,2020-06-25 19:22:34,hfruhb,Nah beat you at yours to go clear then get smashed by Watford at home last game to go behind on gd
2738,2020-06-25 19:12:37,hfruhb,Not related- but how do you get the flag of your team? I've tried and it only gets me the white and blue flag
2739,2020-06-25 19:05:00,hfruhb,"I don't think anybody has called Arsenal brilliant for a long, long time now though. Arsenal have been shit for a while."
2740,2020-06-25 21:00:33,hfruhb,"I remember being impressed by Valery in the last Arsenal Southampton game I watched (may have been a season ago) because of his ability going forward. But yeah, watching him today, he was pretty much a non-factor defensively."
2741,2020-06-25 22:45:46,hfruhb,who'll pay 30 million for him?
2742,2020-06-26 10:12:42,hfruhb,"Repeated relegation struggles really damage a fanbase. Swansea fans are still a little too quick to turn on the team, even two years later. We weren't like that before"
2743,2020-06-25 19:01:16,hfruhb,Fucking southerners smh
2744,2020-06-25 20:31:49,hfruhb,"It really hasn't been that bad at St Mary's this year. Fans got behind the team when we went down to 10 against Newcastle and even rallied when we concede direct from a corner against Burnley.

And even if it has been toxic the players and past managers have made it that way. We lost 9 fucking nil at home and have put in countless insipid performances. The fans who pay their money have a right to let the players know what they think!"
2745,2020-06-25 19:39:41,hfruhb,Think this was our 8th win under Mikel
2746,2020-06-25 19:45:35,hfruhb,> haha
2747,2020-06-25 19:15:44,hfruhb,Sorry :( I just want my chance at free money
2748,2020-06-25 20:15:44,hfruhb,"I've actually went back and watched the highlights of that game and you're right. I was remembering a different one, it might have been Liverpool."
2749,2020-06-26 08:57:09,hfruhb,"Yeah, after the injury he was never the same again imo."
2750,2020-06-25 20:16:07,hfruhb,Yeah I realised there I was remembering the wrong game. I stand corrected.
2751,2020-06-25 22:48:04,hfruhb,"Honestly I gotta apologize mate, I read the start of your previous comment as “nobody should get behind Willock”, I agree he has a lot of maturing to do, a Championship loan would do him well next season imo"
2752,2020-06-25 19:36:58,hfruhb,He played much more as a LWB with Tierney/Kolasinac at LCB in a 523 today despite being a LCM in a 433 on the initial team sheet.
2753,2020-06-26 09:20:16,hfruhb,"

When people speak about midfield they mean the centre two, Saka normally plays out wide"
2754,2020-06-25 19:25:28,hfruhb,you just become a supporter of Hoffenheim mate. You got no choice. Viva Hoffenheim
2755,2020-06-27 12:19:34,hfruhb,Check the daily discussion
2756,2020-06-25 19:04:41,hfruhb,"Dont lump us in with those melts.

FP atmosphere is electric"
2757,2020-06-25 19:19:29,hfruhb,"Just kidding. 

Or am I?

2785,2020-06-25 19:44:41,hfqtkp,I kinda forgot we got Homer Bailey.

2787,2020-06-26 11:46:51,hfqtkp,I think the Angels did.
2788,2020-06-28 19:29:04,hfqtkp,Angels need pitching badly and he is a So Cal kid. Seemed like an easy pick. Only guarantee about Cole is that he was not returning to the Astros.
2789,2020-06-25 19:43:20,hfqtkp,I’ve got Epstein on the phone right now offering my soul for him to sign Puig

2794,2020-06-30 14:49:34,hfqtkp,"Until they realized it was a two horse race and the other horse was willing to do literally anything to win. The Yankees haven’t had truly dominant starting pitching in years, for the last decade plus it’s been above average pitching and an amazing bullpen. Whether it was 2019, or the Kuroda, Burnett, Sabathia, and Brandon McCarthy days that we’re held together by a good bullpen, with, most notably, Mariano Rivera. And you know what? It never worked for them, they weren’t winning that way so at least spending here takes the blame off the GM and owner if they don’t win."
2795,2020-07-02 16:06:15,hfqtkp,"In hindsight, the ""Cole wants to sign with the Angels"" leaks smell like misinformation put out by the Boras camp to scare the Yankees into thinking that they'd need to greatly outbid the Angels."
2796,2020-06-26 11:47:38,hfqtkp,How much mileage is on your soul?  You might have to throw in a soul to be named later.

2799,2020-06-25 18:12:59,hfqs19,"> Has anyone else been looking forward to the release of this book?

Yes.  It's been frustrating to have to point to an undergraduate research summary with no demonstration of the evidence for the past few *years*.

It's probably another topic entirely, but this points to major inefficiencies in research dissemination models in the field of religious studies.  They apparently did not get the memo (or are still dealing with monopolistic copyright practices on the part of publishers) about how the internet can be used to self publish preliminary data almost instantly."
2800,2020-06-25 18:40:24,hfqs19,"John's parchment is interesting because it follows the Joseph Smith translation pattern:  He uses the rock, he sees a parchment on the rock (or in place of it?) and reads the writing off of the parchment.  He did the same for the Book of Mormon.  The only slight difference in the book of Abraham is that there was actual parchment, but as Lucy pointed out he could read the characters just as well even if they were damaged or missing from the scroll.

Into the 1880s there is even a quote about using the Urim and Thummim (i.e. the rock?) in the temple to see old books and read off the names of people who need to have their temple work done.  This is the last reference that I have seen to this technique in Mormonism."
2801,2020-06-25 18:19:00,hfqs19,I hope for a detailed review on this sub. 🙂

2806,2020-06-26 03:48:55,hfqs19,Do you have a source for that 1880s Urim and Thummim in the temple bit?  That is fascinating.
2807,2020-06-26 12:37:17,hfqs19,Wayment talks about it in his Gospel Tangents interview.  He said that something like 70% of the time when there was italics in the KJV and Joseph changed it he went with Clark.  70% is quite a bit imho.

Based on this quote and the fact that it was placed on the alter during the dedication, I speculate (and this is pure speculation) that the seer stone(s) (brown and/or white) may have been kept in the holy of holies in the Manti temple until the SLC temple was completed."

2811,2020-06-25 18:06:30,hfqggp,"It's ESPN my man, don't take it too seriously. They are like Entertainment Tonight for sports, no facts just drama."
2812,2020-06-25 18:29:28,hfqggp,"Stephen A and Max Kellerman are the fucking worst at this. They bypass so much legitimate info and go straight into shit talking the franchise with 0 legitimate reason. Meanwhile stupid fanbases (cowboys, Patriots, steelers ect.) Eat it up and just accept it as the way it is 'cause it's the jets'. Fuck both those clowns. I disagree with Cowherd on this, but the dude consistently gives us credit where it is due and loves Sam, so I cant really hate on him too bad. But Stephen A and Kellerman can go fuck themselves."
2813,2020-06-25 17:42:47,hfqggp,"The Jets have missed the playoffs for a decade straight. Until they become consistent winners, the narrative surrounding the franchise isn't going anywhere. 
  
If you're getting mad at ESPN talking heads, however... you've got bigger fish to fry"

2815,2020-07-05 20:46:37,hfqggp,Well put op
2816,2020-06-25 18:35:05,hfqggp,ESPN does sports again? I thought they were only about politics
2817,2020-06-25 18:14:37,hfqggp,"That is true, but they create the narrative so if left unchecked their drama becomes facts for people who don't know better."
2818,2020-06-25 18:31:37,hfqggp,Easily the two most ridiculous people on sports talk shows. I agree with you wholeheartedly
2819,2020-06-25 17:53:09,hfqggp,"Yes, we were last in the playoffs in 2010, but we are far from the most inept franchise in football. Our drought is bad, but at least we aren't Tampa or the Browns. More importantly, at least we don't underachieve every year like.... the Cowboys, Saints, Rams, Chargers, etc. We aren't good enough to make the playoffs yet ESPN and every other sports media company have our name in their mouths and its garbage. I am tired of it honestly."
2820,2020-06-25 17:46:57,hfqggp,For real bro jets been ass for years I love my team but we gotta be real we ain’t winning no time soon. What owner hires Adam Gase ? Bell most likely will be gone after this year. This team let Robby walk for 2/ 20 mill lol smh this Organization is not stable it’s sad
2821,2020-06-26 02:39:26,hfqggp,I think he’s helping destroy that relationship. He’s been doing it for a long time
2822,2020-07-05 20:47:09,hfqggp,"Thanks man, it was a heated moment lol"
2823,2020-06-25 21:41:19,hfqggp,"That's racist!

^^^just ^^^don't ^^^ask ^^^me ^^^how"
2824,2020-06-25 23:23:41,hfqggp,"Tampa won the SB in 2002, that’s a lot more recently than a lot of teams, like the Jets"
2825,2020-06-25 18:01:01,hfqggp,"We have been a bottom-5 franchise in football the past decade. We don't underachieve every year... because we've sucked and had zero expectations.  The Cowboys/Saints/Rams/Chargers underachieve in the playoffs, which is a hugely important distinction because they've put winning products on the field - the Jets haven't  
  
We play in the largest media market in the country and have a robust history of shooting ourselves in the foot repeatedly. Joe Douglas has done a good job so far but one solid offseason doesn't mean jack shit and in no way is going to undo the reputation this franchise has."
2826,2020-06-25 17:53:57,hfqggp,"We aren't winning what? a super bowl? probably not, but more games and making a wild card or potentially winning this shit show of a division right now? possibly even with gase."
2827,2020-06-25 18:12:10,hfqggp,"I don't know man. I agree this team isn't built for immediate success, but I have liked what Douglas has done so far. To that end, I am fine if Bell leaves after the year. He is very good, but replaceable for cheaper.  I think that money would be better spent on an edge rusher."
2828,2020-06-25 23:41:27,hfqggp,"True, but they haven’t made the playoffs in awhile"
2829,2020-06-25 18:04:45,hfqggp,So they underachieve and that's somehow better than knowing you need to change your culture and bring in the right pieces. ACTIVELY TRYING to improve. Yes we have a history of doing it and yet that has absolutely NOTHING to do with this regime and what Joe Douglas is doing or how he handles himself does it. Reputation doesn't matter if the same pieces aren't in place. You're just enabling them shitting on the team because you refuse to even give someone the benefit of the doubr. Joe Douglas has done nothing but work his ass off to improve the team across the board. Even with the offseason basically done when he took the job he still attempted some radical moves like bringing in Mack in hopes sit could correct a problem he didn't create.
2830,2020-06-25 21:32:52,hfqggp,"Compared to how poised we COULD be to take a wide open decision, we've not been preparing very well for this."
2831,2020-06-25 18:29:10,hfqggp,"I don't want to see Bell leave because he is perfect for Sam. More importantly, he is professional and carries himself like a true leader. Edge would be great, but our front 7 is going to be much improved and I expect the defense with or without Jamal to be solid against the run. It is on the corners to help us get some coverage sacks this year and give our guys sometime."
2832,2020-06-25 23:46:44,hfqggp,"True. Yeah at least we aren’t the Browns tho Lmaoo. Every year they “win the offseason” and are always a piece a way from being the breakout team, then...disappointment"
2833,2020-06-25 18:10:32,hfqggp,"I don't think you understand that those franchises underachieving relative to expectations still means they have been way more successful than the Jets no matter how you slice it.  
  
Joe Douglas, good guy or not, hasn't proven anything yet. His first draft and FA class hasn't taken a single snap. He doesn't get the benefit of the doubt from talking heads, who again, you really shouldn't be getting riled up by what they have to say, considering that's exactly what their job is."
2834,2020-06-25 21:41:43,hfqggp,"No denying our previous regimes have been absolutely awful. I don’t deny that, I just truly believe that the narratives carrying over to entirely new staffs is ridiculous"
2835,2020-06-25 19:59:20,hfqggp,"You can like Bell as a player and his demeanor and character, but ultimately you don't win paying an RB as much as we are. Tho I do love Bell and really hope the addition of Becton amongst our other line moves gets him back to form."
2836,2020-06-26 00:17:54,hfqggp,Yup that’s the story with them lol
2837,2020-06-25 18:14:00,hfqggp,"Underachieving is way worse than knowing you aren't good and working to improve it. As shown by the Rams literally IMPLODING upon getting whipped and now look like they will be utter garbage.   


His class with the Jets might not have but EVERY team he has worked for has been molded with his help and what do you know they are good. So it sounds like he has definitely done enough to get the benefit of the doubt when this is his first real offseason. Once again you can enable them and say ""that's their job"" but by doing so you allow them to craft a narrative of loljets and we suck and don't care about our star players or getting better. That's what is sad and that's what costing us real fair coverage in the media."
2838,2020-06-25 21:46:44,hfqggp,we're just at a point where we gotta earn respect because we don't deserve it otherwise
2839,2020-06-26 00:18:31,hfqggp,We keep our expectations looooow
2840,2020-06-25 18:18:26,hfqggp,"All these teams that you list as 'underacheiving' are also working to improve as well, believe it or not. The Rams 'literally IMPLODING' meant winning 9 games. We've won 9 games once this decade.  
  
Winning games is the only way to improve public image and get 'real fair coverage' from daytime sports television like you so desperately crave. There's literally no other way I can explain that."
2841,2020-06-25 21:49:01,hfqggp,Maybe to some but the people we have brought in minus Gase have all proven success somewhere. That means something
2842,2020-06-25 18:27:22,hfqggp,"Yeah, I'd say going from Super Bowl to 9 games and the having to cut contributors, have retiring players or players leave in F/A is in fact imploding. They will not sniff a super bowl anytime soon. Yes, those teams are attempting to improve, but that doesn't change they are not performing to what they have. We had nothing to show the last decade because we didn't have jack shit on the team. Winning games is the only way to improve the public image? We finished the year 6-2 in our last 8 games. I suppose we can add you to the list of self-hating jets fans who also pander to the NFL as it stands today. You might want to go to r/nfl to find someone who will laugh along with you. I care about the franchise fuck the opinions of those who only look to stop us from ever-changing."
2843,2020-06-25 23:23:00,hfqggp,Head Coach is a pretty important position to have a major weakness at...
2844,2020-06-25 18:36:37,hfqggp,"The Rams pushed their chips in to make the SB in 2018 with a QB still on a rookie contract, something this franchise cannot dream of doing. It boggles my mind that you think that going to the Super Bowl and winning 9 games the year after somehow deserves less respect than losing for a decade straight.  
  
We finished 6-2 against a slate of bottom-feeding teams, Duck Hodges, and the Bills backups, and lost to two winless teams along the way. Last year was as empty of a 7-9 season as you could ever have.   
  
I'm not a self-hating Jets fan. You can find me defending this franchise on r/NFL all day. I'm looking at it realistically. Until the Jets become a consistent winner, they will not get respect from talking heads."
2845,2020-06-25 23:41:56,hfqggp,Yeah but he’s hands off on two sides of the ball
2846,2020-06-25 18:38:10,hfqggp,Who said it deserves less respect? No one. I said they underachieve and that’s more indefensible than being bad and knowing your bad and trying to change. Jamal could easily continue to be apart of that and we could get somewhere while Sam is *pretends to act shocked* on his rookie contract.
2847,2020-06-25 20:00:41,hfqggp,You sound like an asshole dude. You can't stack the jets next to the saints. Us jets fans know more than anybody how much we've sucked the past decade. To somehow twist it around to believe that since the Rams only won 9 after making the SB is some how worse than being dogshit for another year in a row.... Lol wtf dude? We deserve to get shit on until we don't. We seem to be heading in the right direction but we haven't proven a single thing yet. Not a single one. Before this Jamal shit we were hoping leveon doesn't get canned. How fucking dumb that it's on the table. It's almost like the jets don't give a single fuck about winning and are just content being in such a profitable market. Anybody who roots for this team and doesn't feel some sort of bad about the past decade is an idiot. We deserve the media shitting us but it'll be that much better if we ever get our shit together and become a competitor. Just because we were expected to suck and ended up sucking.... How the fuck is that better than being expected to win 11 and only winning 9?
2848,2020-06-25 20:08:39,hfqggp,"You’re a moron. No one feels good about being bad for 10 years. I’ve been a fan for 20 years, I haven’t seen ya be respected basically ever in my life span. We can absolutely stack teams to make comparisons, any of those work, good teams underperforming is also just as egregious as bad teams being bad. Coming in 2nd place might be a great moral victory but the point is to win the super bowl, and if that means we had to suck for 10, 20, 30 years to put it all together and start becoming a winning competitive franchise so be it. But I’d rather that than consistently be the runner-up and never winning. At least we can see change occurring and the team taking after a GM who believes in hard work, values players much more competently than any GM we have had in my life, and we are trending the right direction. Forget Gase forget the shitty past because it does suck, our team is trying to improve and you dick riders would rather say hell yes let’s have the media continue to tell us how we are so incompetent and so shitty it will never happen. Just trade all the good players, never actually try to improve! Your the jets and that’s all that matters. I am definitely an asshole when it comes to dealing with people who accept a label written in permanent marker that tells me who the fuck someone or something is going to be forever because you deemed it so."
2849,2020-06-25 20:25:58,hfqggp,"There's no point with you. The other guy tried. Maybe you should try talking to your tv when ESPN is on, it would be just as receptive as you are."
2850,2020-06-25 20:41:46,hfqggp,You got it! The entire point of the post is the bullshit narrative being created and pushed by everyone about the Jets. How little did I realize that parts of our own fanbase were guilty of helping continue that narrative.
2851,2020-06-30 16:12:48,hipx0v,"That is the question we should be asking all TBM’s when they say there’s no “evidence” he had sexual relations with those wives. 

“Why is it so important for you to know he didn’t have sex with these women?”

And does it not matter if any of the other prophets did? Because that’s extremely evident. 

The fact is, once they allow themselves to entertain the thought that Joseph was Indeed having sex with young teenagers, the next thought is that maybe Joseph wasn’t that great of a guy, and then dominoes start falling."

My response is and always will be, if this is true - if your version of ""reality"" is true, than that means that while the Potato Famine was killing over a million people in Ireland and the Slave trade was afflicting MILLIONS of innocent men, women and children and would affect their families for generations, GOD was sending an angel with a flaming sword to force JS to accept the practice of polygamy and marry teenagers and other mens wives.

Might take a few years (or decades) but it's a deal breaker for sure. This was my first shelf issue, when I was 15. It's fair game to tell believers who are really awkward talking about it that yes, J-dog was 38 and married a 14 year old and Lorenzo Snow was 57 when he hooked up with a 15 year old. It catches up to a large percentage of  Mormons eventually."

About five years ago I was active and teaching youth Sunday school (14-15 year olds).

My wife and I got into an argument about polygamy one night and I was trying to defend it with the usual FAIR responses. 

Then my wife said, “okay, let’s say the prophet told you to marry [girl in Sunday school class]. Would you do it?”

My mind was blown. It really put it into perspective how young some of JS wives were. I couldn’t defend it after that."
2861,2020-07-01 02:05:36,hipx0v,"I find the ""they didn't consummate the marriage"" argument lacking because regardless of what evidence we have that they had sex, we know that the women, TEENAGE women, were LIVING like they were off the market. 

Their entire life was altered and I dare say taken from them. Hellen Mar Kimball couldn't go to dances, date, find out who she truly was, all because God told Joseph she was promised to him and she would be rewarded with her whole family getting the golden ticket to heaven if she said yes."

I'm not sure if I believe in God or not anymore, but if there is a God, he certainly wouldn't condone the type of behavior JS engaged in. So the obvious answer was that Joseph Smith was a fraud, liar, cheat, conman, and an absolutely horrible husband.

When they say not all were consummated, they use that uncertainty to argue that all of the married women and the youngest “wives” were among those whose marriages were not consummated.

Hales and TBMs goal is to only admit “ordinary polygamy” but not 14-15 year olds and not married women. Church members are conditioned to accept ordinary polygamy, if there is such a thing.

In mythology she represents fertility (be careful lol) and the flow of the arts, like music, writing, languages etc and also good fortune. She's also said to be the guardian of the sacred wishing gem.

Some depictions have her being crowned by another deity within a gateway (can't remember what it's called, will google and update. Something like a torii or tori) between prophane and sacred space. So maybe cleansing of the spirit. 

The possibility of dreaming of a stern woman made me think of her. Sounds like he has a past with her, which is why he said ""again."" So I'm sure her curiosity would be from that past.

She also supposedly controls snakes and serpents and with this demon called ""Larva"" which makes me think ""worm"" and also that it may transform, perhaps she has some form of control.  

This is all speculation and probably wrong lol. But if it is her, and she likes you, be careful of possible pregnancy.

2943,2020-06-30 16:42:30,hip052,"It's amazing how much that Jimmy Butler pick is carrying the Bulls in this ranking.

The Bulls made 19 raw selections since 2010 but through trades they ended up keeping 13* of them.

Of those 13 they currently have 6 on the team, Coby White, Daniel Gafford, Wendell Carter Jr, Chandler Hutchison, Lauri Markkanen, Denzel Valentine.

Of those 6 all 6 of them were playing on their rookie contracts this season. 

While I am excited about the core the Bulls have put in place, provided they can find an NBA level head coach, I do think this ranking needs to take in to account whether or not teams were able to build around the picks that are being ranked so highly and the Bulls absolutely punted on building around Jimmy Butler which should count against them.



*Malcolm Lee, Kevin Seraphin, Norris Cole, Gary Harris, Jusuf Nurkic, Jordan Bell, Justin Patton were all traded before putting on a Bulls uniform in exchange for cap space, cap space, cap space, Doug McDermot, Cash Considerations, Lauri Markkenan more or less in that order."

I know it’s not really relevant to the question, but the Mavs excellence in the second round in FA should give them a little forgiveness for their 20 years of incompetence in the first round, save for Luka."
2945,2020-06-30 19:04:17,hip052,"I'm just curious. Do the rankings calculate in undrafted guys? If not, that makes the Raptors being first even more impressive, because guys like Fred VanVleet and Terence Davis went undrafted. Even the Jonas Valanciunas pick, which is listed as the worst on the first chart, was pretty solid. He went 5th overall, and the picks right after him were Jan Vesely, Bismack Biyombo and Brandon Knight. JV didn't turn into a superstar, but he's been a pretty solid starter for his whole career.

As for other teams, that Kawhi pick really lifts the Spurs. They have had some other good picks (like Dejounte Murray), but overall, I don't know that I would rank them as high as #2.

I like the Nuggets drafting better than the Spurs. Obviously, the Jokic pick carries them a lot, but I think that MPJ will end up rating very highly on there given a few more years (got him criminally low at #14). While he won't be a superstar, I think the Malik Beasley pick will look great in a couple of years, too. He couldn't get enough playing time with their deep lineup, but now that he looks like he will get a bigger role, I think he will be a breakout guy in the next couple of years. Another guy they drafted, who developed on another team, and who isn't mentioned there is Evan Fournier, who they snagged at 20th overall in 2012. Maybe that doesn't count, since they traded him after a couple of years for Arron Afflalo, but, if we are just looking at drafting, then they did draft him. Overall, I think once the MPJ and Beasley picks have some time to settle, the Nuggets will jump up to #2 on there.

From the rest, the one team that is criminally low on that list is the Grizzlies. I assume that is because their last couple of draft picks haven't had the time to fully develop their resumes in the NBA. They got lucky to get the #2 pick for Ja last year, but they also got the steal of the draft with Brandon Clarke at 21. The previous year, Jaren Jackson was a great grab, albeit with a high pick at #4, but they also snagged Jevon Carter at 32, who got traded to Phoenix, but looks like a solid rotation piece. They got Dillon Brooks at 45 in 2017 (a 15.7 ppg starter in his third season). So, while they didn't draft well at the start of the decade, I think that once the recent draftees have a bit more time to improve their resumes, they will rank much higher on that list."
2946,2020-06-30 18:00:47,hip052,"I'm utterly shocked to see the Pistons this high. I decided to go back and look at all the players we picked and man... it's not as rosy as it seems above. I could be over/under rating some of these guys, but here's my thoughts.

2947,2020-06-30 17:24:09,hip052,"I've got to say I really don't like the results the VORP version was generating. To a certain extent you have to judge the quality of the metrics by the results its giving you, and that VORP list is clearly favoring guys who had a brief splash of surprising efficient play and then flamed out (Fields, Peters, Hummel) or who look decent but haven't proven anything yet (Niang, Time Lord).

The WS version looks really nice and gives some very reasonable results."
2948,2020-06-30 19:04:58,hip052,"As a Raptors fan, I'm not super surprised, but I did have a question.

Even with how Pascal is poised to enter the top 10 (though his play did worsen a bit throughout the year), I feel surprised to see Green award fewer points than him, he was a later pick and to me it's a no-brainer which has been so far. Hell, even if Siakam has been a top 15 player (arguably) this year, I would argue that Draymond is top 10 come playoffs. Not just that, but Delon's above him, who I know less about - does he really deserve the amount of points he's getting?"
2949,2020-06-30 17:41:34,hip052,I would have to say the warriors did the best drafting as they made a dynasty off their own draft picks. Draymond at the end of the second round might be one of the goat picks and curry and klay were both great picks as well. Personally I think the best draft should be determined by results and accomplishments.
2950,2020-06-30 18:07:53,hip052,"This is so strange to me because Dillon Brooks was pretty much the de facto Grizzlies’ best draft pick this past decade until landing Jaren and Ja/Clarke in back to back drafts. The Grizzlies were one of the worst drafting teams in the league under the chunderhead former GM Chris Wallace, but still were a playoff mainstay for much of the 2010s"
2951,2020-06-30 17:35:04,hip052,"I really like this post as a whole but the one thing that set off my Celtics Fan Bias was that Avery Bradley was considered a massive negative for the Celtics despite him being considered a pretty good player before he was traded from the Celtics. 

But even more than that if you back to the 2010 draft there are only 22 other guys I recognize from the NBA, so there is absolutely no reason he would be a reach at 19. Having looked at his career vorp and ws, he is not favored by these statistics, in fact his career vorp is negative, but his numbers at Boston are certainly better (his vorp becomes 1 instead of negative) maybe it’s worth considering only the seasons players spent with the team who drafted them.

I know you switched to win shares which makes Greg Monroe one of the better picks despite him being evolved out of the league. So maybe vorp for drafting team would be a better measure, because you are focusing on how draftees are affecting their original team."
2952,2020-06-30 18:04:58,hip052,"I don’t feel honest counting Niang for the Pacers considering he only played 23 games for us and has produced only recently for the Jazz. 

Also I Can’t overstate enough how bad of a pick TK Leaf was."
2953,2020-06-30 18:08:37,hip052,"Nice analysis. I’m really excited to see what the Spurs can do with a higher draft pick this year. 

Not sure how deep this draft is, but if history is any indication, they should be able to get a solid player where they’re picking."
2954,2020-06-30 17:40:29,hip052,"Great post, I really appreciate the work you did here and how clear everything is. I'm not sure if you got the inspiration from this, but your analysis reminded me a lot of [this recent article](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2020/nfl-drafting-efficiency-2010-2019) from Football Outsiders that attempted to do a very similar thing to what you did - figure out which teams drafted the best by comparing the return they got from their draft (measured in Approximate Value, a statistic somewhat comparable to Win Shares) to the draft capital the team had. I think a follow-up to this post would be great if it could include a statistical analysis like in the Consistency & Variance portion of the Football Outsiders article, going over the randomness and luck involved in drafting. Great post regardless!"
2955,2020-06-30 19:47:37,hip052,"Really surprised how low the Thunder are considering that Sam Presti seemed to be one the best gms in the league in accumulating talent. Not disagreeing with your method at all, just noting something I find interesting."
2956,2020-06-30 18:12:48,hip052,"This is really cool. Two things.

1. Did you thibk of looking at the data another way, where instead of ranking by total value relative to draft spot it’s by the percent of the time that a team gets a player who is better than the average player drafted in that spot. This method is of course basic and imperfect, and could be fine-tuned with weighting the actual value vs. draft spot a bit, but I feel like it adjusts for luck. Although unlikely, any team can draft a seocnd round or late first round player who becomes an all star. It’d be cool to see if there are any teams that consistently draft well, and not just hit the jackpot a couple of times.

2. How did you assemble this data? I’m guessing you didn’t go through every class by hand (unless you did, of course, and in that case massive props to you), and then how did you do it? What tools? Would really appreciate if you could share."
2957,2020-06-30 18:25:37,hip052,"Have been looking for something like this. Also, another factor that could be included into this would be that specific player’s performance on their particular team that drafted them. Notably, Sacramento is getting carried by Whiteside who played a mere 19 games and logged 111 minutes over the course of 2 years. It might almost be worse to draft a good player late in the draft but then give up on them too early."
2958,2020-06-30 16:06:56,hip052,"Hi my dude, it is a very nicely done statistical post, I certainly hope you get more responses than mine.

I only have one qualm, which comes with the definition of success as a regular season victory.

As time passes, more and more teams load manage precisely because after about 44 wins, apart from perhaps seeding, doesn't matter if you win 45-50 or 65.

I see at the top of the list a majority of teams that have not won anything, and I struggle to agree with a definition of success different from the end goal of any GM which is to eventually attain a championship.

For example.. apart from last year, due to Kawhi being there, you get a bunch of empty wins in the regular seasons by the raptors and then regularly wiped.

Same by the Jazz, so I guess my question is what you define the purpose of the draft to be and/or how could one solved my complaint :)"
2959,2020-06-30 18:37:35,hip052,"I think you need to smooth out any adjustments you make due to draft position. There are too many outliers that distort the value curve. The 5th overall position is a good example of this. You have greats such as Garnett, Allen, Wade, and Carter drafted 5th overall, so your calculation probably shows the 5th overall pick should be extremely valuable. This unfairly penalizes any other 5th overall pick, which is probably why you have Valanciunas so low in your first table. He had the 5th most win shares in his draft year."
2960,2020-07-01 00:27:25,hip052,This is great! I looked at doing something like this once but wasn’t quite as objective in the sense of using win shares or any other metric but more personal preference. I tried to look at what if our teams could go into the past and draft the best players available to them in order to build the best team now- who would have the best team? So Giannis would be drafted by whomever had the #1 pick that year and such. It was pretty interesting but I didn’t finish it. Might be something fun to follow up on your data!
2961,2020-07-11 06:32:37,hip052,"The problem with this list is the negative players.  For example,  It's simply not fair to almost entirely cancel out the Jokic pick because Mudiay was shit.  But Mudiay was only so shitty because the Nuggets actually gave him a chance.  The players who didn't get a chance to play aren't as negative.  The only way to handle this is to see any player that has negative VORP or WS as a net zero because they likely won't be on the team long anyway.  For example was the Mudiay pick really that much worse than the Bruno Caboclo pick? The net result is the same,  they both ended up off their teams.   

&#x200B;

When it comes to the draft we need to assume every player is a bust and only reward non-bust picks.  You can say the farther back a team takes a star the better, but high pick busts should just be counted as equal to low pick busts because taking busts is so common.  For example the 76ers are clearly a top 10 drafting team this decade.  They ended the process with Ben Simmons and Embiid.  Those successful picks actually cancel out many of their bad picks.  Again because everyone is likely to bust we need to treat all busts as equal while only judging the quality of the non-busts."
2962,2020-06-30 20:00:40,hip052,"Hm, just brainstorming a bit about this. How about something like this: Test the picks against how many minutes the players have been playing per season and how many games their team won in those seasons.

Example:

* #1 pick, playing 35 min on a 30 win team
* #46 pick, playing 20 min on a 50 win team

Maybe exclude the first 2-3 seasons to give the team time to grow around their high draft picks, and 2nd round picks to prove their worth. If top players are franchise altering, then their teams should have better records by year 3 or 4. And if the player sucks, they won't receive playing time by this point."
2963,2020-06-30 20:48:44,hip052,"There’s just one thing I gotta address.  How is Karl-Anthony Towns a draft steal?  Yes he’s obviously good value still, but he went #1.  He was the first player selected and expected to be the best.  1st overall picks are usually supposed to become stars and he did just that.  I don’t see how the 1st pick in any draft can be considered a steal.  The 2nd and 3rd picks can easily be steals outperforming #1, but #1 is supposed to be the top.   KAT hasn’t even lead the team to the playoffs yet.  Jimmy Butler did that and then when he left, the Wolves were bad again."
2964,2020-06-30 21:37:10,hip052,"I am inclined to believe that the second method is a better method for determining how good of a pick a draft pick is. I base this on the fact that Markelle Fultz is not considered one of the sixers worst draft picks using the first method. However, in the second method, he is considered one of the worst draft picks. Being picked first overall and never contributing any useful minutes for the team that drafted him, Markelle needs to be considered one of the worst."
2965,2020-06-30 21:55:44,hip052,I think the answer is Milwaukee because they drafted Giannis and the Spurs because they drafted Kawhi. They are the only guys drafted in the 2010s who have shown they could be the best player on a championship team. Everything else you do as a team is secondary to that.
2966,2020-06-30 23:50:56,hip052,"Dang apparently I dont pay nearly enough attention. I had no idea that Winslow hadnt grow into a near All-star type of player yet AND that he got traded. I really thought he was going to be a REALLY good player, like hall of very good by the time he retired, but it seems like he hasnt really grown beyond his shooting getting a bit better"
2967,2020-07-01 00:02:53,hip052,Given the long rightward tail to the distribution this method essentially penalizes teams with a large number of picks high in the draft in the time period relative to teams who have gotten better than expected value out of the middle / back end of the draft. I would argue that nailing high picks is a much more valuable skill than getting value from the middle/end of the draft.
2968,2020-07-01 00:30:40,hip052,"Unpopular opinion, the Kings. I feel that if they make one good blockbuster trade they could be a contender. They’ve stayed in the middle of the pack when it comes to the playoffs but bagley and fox have missed a lot of time as well. But both of them could develop into superstars at their positions, Fox especially. Also earlier in the decade they drafted boogie although he didn’t pan out really. I think if they make one blockbuster trade for an agile wing, someone like DeRozan, I think they could be contenders. That team probably wouldn’t win any rings but they’d be like the grit and grind grizzlies from earlier this decade. They’d get stopped by a team with larger superstar talent though."
2969,2020-07-01 06:05:42,hip052,"I wish u/dmorey had a bigger sample size, but he has done good work with low-value picks. 

I suspect he could see a slight uptick as some of his more recent picks are going to keep gaining value."

2971,2020-07-01 08:03:14,hip052,In fairness to my cavs: we traded both wiggins and Bennett for Kevin Love who played a vital part in pur 2016 run. Kyrie and Tristan were also vital during that run so TL;DR: No Ragrets
2972,2020-07-01 15:36:01,hip052,"This is dope good work. I do have one criticism. Is it more of a team’s players who end up good or to get good players to help their team?

Like with the Kings, you have Whiteside, but he didn’t really do anything for them, not coming into his own until he was on the Heat. He played in 1 game his rookie year and recorded 2 fouls. Next season he played in 18 games, and only averaged 1.6ppg, 2.2rpg, and 0.8bpg. His time on the heat shouldn’t really count *for the Kings* right? 

I see the same thing with guys like Buddy and the Pelicans."
2973,2020-07-01 19:53:55,hip052,"The Celtics seemed to hit on all of their early picks (Jaylen, Jayson, Smart). But their mid to late first round picks tend to be iffy.

James Young, Fab Melo, RJ Hunter, MarShon Brooks, Yabusele all were terrible picks.

Jared Sullinger was fine for a late first (a couple good seasons but he got overweight quick), Kelly Olynyk, Terry Rozier were all picks that were solid.

Too early to say with Rob Will, Langford, and Grant Will."

But that would be another post altogether, whether the player was surrounded by a team that could conduct to success was not the point, as well as where the player developed.  


>  I am not answering which team got the most value out of their draft picks because I feel that this has a lot to do with coaching and developing. I am ranking the teams by which team's picks were most likely to outperform their draft position."
2977,2020-06-30 22:18:35,hip052,"Yeah man and the fact that after Jimmy, Mirotic, and Portis the overall haul is so weak kinda explains their performance this decade. Somehow they drafted better when they had worse picks in the beginning of the decade when they had Thibs and Rose. But the fact that they haven't sustained that drafting success into the mid 2010s is one of the reasons why they haven't been good of late."
2978,2020-06-30 19:19:21,hip052,"This is a good point. Front offices should get credit for identifying/signing good players that go undrafted.

2979,2020-06-30 22:31:09,hip052,"Thank you, I'm glad you enjoyed the analysis! When it came to UDFA's I went back and forth a lot. I was considering including them in the draft haul, but signing UDFA's is sometimes a 2 way thing. Every year there are UDFAs who have multiple offers and get to choose which team to join which isn't fair to give one of those suitors credit over the rest who also saw the potential. Then I considered including UDFAs in the calculation of the draft class's strength, but I know there are players who ask not to be drafted in the second so they can be a UDFA which, again, is not fair to hold against the actual second rounders and the teams selecting those players. In the end, I decided to consider signing UDFAs as a different action by the front office altogether than drafting, and I would only consider players who were drafted in the top 60 for the purpose of this analysis. It does end up not making teams like the Mavericks and 76ers and other teams who get great value from these signings look as good as they should, but keep in mind this is by no means an indictment of an endorsement of any front office as there are great organizations like the Thunder and Mavericks near the bottom and not-so-great organizations like the Pistons and Bulls near the top."
2980,2020-07-01 10:13:02,hip052,"Terence Davis and Fred VanVleet literally starter level talents the Raptors rock at Undrafted free agents too and it works to attract more. TD said he picked the Raptors cause they have shown they know how to develop talent, and he is right they do"
2981,2020-06-30 23:49:40,hip052,"So I explained in an earlier comment why I ultimately decided against including UDFAs and I'll copy it here.

Essentially, organizations should 100% be credited for getting value from UDFAs, it's just that I couldn't find a fair way to determine their relative values.

I can see your argument for the Spurs being lower. They also got an advanced stats monster in Kyle Anderson at pick 30 in 2014 who has kinda cooled off since leaving the Spurs, but he also increases their rating a lot. Ultimately, the thing the Spurs should be praised for the most is the lack of any real busts. The Nuggets certainly got one of the most valuable picks of the decade in Jokic as well as other nice picks like Beasley, Morris, Harris, Nurkic, Fournier, etc. But they had a really bad miss in Mudiay which dings them, maybe unfairly, but still dings them. Also, I considered using Medians to calculate overall instead of Mean to avoid outliers, but the outliers are more important in a game like basketball where an individual can carry a team like outliers can carry the mean.

I do agree with your assessment of the Grizzlies having a promising future, especially with Ja and Brandon Clarke already so good. I decided against including 2019 because they haven't even played a full season but I'm sure that would have improved the Grizzlies' overall rating. Unfortunately they didn't make any great picks earlier in the decade, which really brings their average down for this decade, but will probably make them look great in the coming one"
2982,2020-06-30 22:44:29,hip052,Grizzlies have been shit at drafting for YEARS. These newer picks being good is just recency bias (and also because their recent picks have been higher).
2983,2020-07-01 00:54:03,hip052,"So you're rating the Nuggets over the Spurs based on projected future performance? That's not really what this post is about. It's about which teams have found the most value relative to their draft position. With the exception of Kawhi, we haven't had a pick higher than 18th in 23 years, and it's only been as high as 18th a couple times. Most years we don't pick higher than like 27th, and yet we still manage to consistently find productive players with our picks. The Nuggets, as you mentioned, have had several lottery picks this decade, and I can only imagine what Pop and Buford could have done drafting at Denver's spots."
2984,2020-06-30 19:48:35,hip052,"2010 Greg Monroe was not a roleplayer. He was a legit starter.

Same guy in the 2020 game is a roleplayer sure."
2985,2020-06-30 19:49:17,hip052,"Agreed, as a Pistons fan our drafting has been terrible in the lottery. We have made some decent late round picks but the issue is that those guys broke out after we moved on which means we didn't actually get benefits

We have basically made 5 good picks across the last decade. 

Two were 2nd rounders that we dumped before they became good later on. 

One is Luke who is a very good player despite the sting of missing on Mitchell. But his injury issues are starting to become a concern and his extension is a big question. 

One is Dre who is immensely talented but is A) inconsistent, B) plays in an arguably outdated style, and C) was vastly overpaid on the max. 

One is Bruce who made huge strides this year and could become a really quality role player or maybe even a starter on the right team.


Also on KCP, at least he's still a decent NBA player but we didn't extend him beyond his rookie deal. That's a good thing considering he wanted 5/80 but spending a lottery pick for just 4 years of a low end role player is just not good.

The problem is that we consistently whiffed on the important picks and gave up on the 2nd rounders that ended up being great value picks. Even teams that are lower in this table got bigger contributions by either hitting on a lottery pick or just keeping guys without overpaying them."
2986,2020-06-30 22:23:49,hip052,"Believe me, I was super shocked as well because I remember the Pistons draft picks being KCP, Stanley Johnson, Henry Ellenson, etc. There's a couple reasons why the Pistons are so high. Win Shares loves Drummond and Monroe and great second round finds in Middleton and Dinwiddie that contributed nothing to Detroit because of poor development/short sightedness. Another reason why I think I never considered the Pistons to be a good drafting organization is because we always remember the ""picked before"" players like Kennard picked before Mitchell, KCP before CJ, Knight before Kemba which does factor somewhat because I rate them based on overall draft class performance, but the fact that the pick right after became so much better makes Detroit's picks look even worse."
2987,2020-06-30 22:00:21,hip052,"To be fair, the pistons have had problems with player development, not drafting. And I think Monroe and knight were a tick above role player quality. They've been pretty productive pros"

2993,2020-06-30 22:53:20,hip052,"I would say the Warriors have been the best organization of the past decade, and my analysis should not take away anything from how great they have been. One could say the Klay and Draymond picks were the 2 most important draft selections of this decade. That being said, every organization makes mistakes and the Warriors have been guilty of a few. To me the biggest mistake this decade was drafting Ekpe Udoh and I do not want to even imagine what Paul George or Gordon Heyward added to those teams, but that's what they could have had. Of course that is just one mistake, but there have been a couple picks where they didn't really get as much value as they could have. Fortunately for Warriors fans, those ""mistakes"" ended up being inconsequential because of the aforementioned selections and others (like Looney who someone else brought up), great coaching and system which promoted development, and great free agency decisions (like Iggy, Livingston, Javale, and maybe another big one that I'm forgetting about :))"

He found guys at the bottom of the barrel that could contribute (JaMychal Green, Wayne Selden, etc), and he kept the best players in town.

2998,2020-06-30 22:43:15,hip052,"I'm with you on Avery Bradley man, I think he's a great player and should be more of a steal than a bust at that position. I tried my best not to include my confirmation bias when evaluating, but Avery Bradley was actually one of the reasons I decided on a different approach. I didn't want to factor in value to the drafting team because there are cases when teams recognize the value of the player they draft but trade that player away for something better. For example I think the Clippers deserve credit for drafting Eric Bledsoe even if his stats with the Clippers weren't as great as they would later be. They used him as a trade piece because they recognized his value not because they wanted to move on, so I don't think they should be penalized for that.

I guess if I were to use maybe peak VORP would be better as you said instead of career VORP for evaluating a player's career, and that would make the Avery Bradley selection seem a lot better as it should. Thanks for the input!"

Sure Bradley was a negative, but the accumulation of negatives from the other 1st round picks that didn't pan out likely added up to the middling ranking.

TJ Leaf was such a baffling pick. We knew the PG trade was imminent and we had weak depth on our wings regardless and OG was looking solid and coming out of IU. Would’ve been a good pick for the fans and press as well as a position of need. All around win. I guess the injury was a concern and winning is always the priority for the Pacers but I don’t get it. He would’ve been great down the line with a decent ceiling. That said, we seem to find good talent in the second round even if they just end up on the Mad Ants or practice squad guys like Alize and Sumner are really intriguing projects.

He looks really promising at time and can explodes for a weeks or 2, but then all the sudden he fades into the background and totally disappears for the next couple weeks.  As a Canes fan, I have hope but he really needs to find some consistency.  For the sake of seeing the Spurs back where they “belong” they gotta hit on this next pick and keep Walker developing.  They have some good young guards so I’m expecting a wing or even a big here.  Maybe they get lucky in the lottery and Weissman falls.  I’m a big fan of taking bigs early too early, but Weissman has a ton of potential and there is nobody better than Pop to help him reach that."

3004,2020-07-01 05:41:33,hip052,"You know what that is actually an interesting approach. I have a feeling the results will be similar since the teams at the top generally didn't have too many negatives. I felt that averaging would let the magnitude of the hits and the magnitude of the misses matter, which was important since even when we normally evaluate teams we consider the big hits and the big misses more. Also due to variance there are a few slight negatives and slight positives who could go the other direction after another year and I'm not sure if having them count as much as a major hit or miss would be fair. I will try your approach and edit this comment later, if you are interested.

Also I did forget to give credit in the post but the statistics are from basketball reference, scraped using beautiful soup which is a python package, and the draft picks are from wikipedia since they had trade information which I wanted. Other python packages I used were numpy and scipy.stats for determining percentiles and averages. I did do the labeling of which pick was whose manually and it took me a while haha. But once I had that I used excel to calculate averages for each team and each round for both models."

Did Sac draft well by picking Whiteside and fail at development or using him to his strengths? Or did his time overseas/g-league/miami make him into that player?"
3007,2020-06-30 16:43:28,hip052,"I mean try telling a Hornets or Knicks or Kings fan that a 50 win team that only wins a round or two in the playoffs is meaningless. I certainly get that the end goal of any team is to win a title, but there is plenty of value in being a consistent top-6 seed in the playoffs - at the end of the day the NBA is an entertainment product, so while a 50 win regular season may not be the ultimate level of success, I would certainly consider it success."
3008,2020-06-30 17:16:55,hip052,"&#x200B;

Would you then not agree that most teams are unsuccessful? the metric you are evaluating success seems more anecdotal. I can see what you are getting at, but 50 plus wins is still a success.

I get that teams with the lower pick generally have decent success already, so its a bit harder to really evaluate the pick's contribution to the team. Its easier to see how a Ben Simmons and a Joel Embiid contribute than it is to see how a Delon Wright contributes. Lottery teams more aim for star players, where the lower picks usually aim for promising role players."
3009,2020-06-30 17:19:02,hip052,Please don’t  ever mention the defending champion Toronto Raptors as a team that never won anything thanks
3010,2020-07-01 08:02:46,hip052,Seems like you’re undervaluing teams that are consistently good. Kawhi was a major part of the raptors winning but so was a deep team full of good shooters and defenders that the raptors drafted. Only one team wins a year and getting deep into the playoffs is much better than being mediocre. The spurs also won this decade and have been a consistent playoff team. There’s value to that
3011,2020-07-01 05:12:09,hip052,"Hmm that's a good idea actually. I originally based it off of historical value of the draft position because that would tell a better story about the distribution of talent in the draft because it probably would not be simply linear, but I have dealt with overfitting as a result. Maybe just including additive smoothing would reduce this. 

For JV in particular, he was considered one of the Raptors' worst picks of the decade by VORP percentile, where 5th overall picks tended to be in the 95th percentile in VORP and JV was in the 84th percentile making him 10th in the class in VORP. He actually outperformed his draft position's expected WS contribution by 0.08% so the second model actually considered him a good value for the pick. I think JV being the Raptors' worst pick in the first model showed how the percentile-based approach was flawed and also was a testament to how well the Raptors have drafted."
3012,2020-06-30 21:46:39,hip052,"Yeah Anthony Davis rates super high on this as well, I think it's just a hiccup in the rating system."
3013,2020-07-01 05:28:43,hip052,"So my second model expects first overall picks to contribute around 25% of a draft's win shares if I'm not mistaken, and this is derived from averaging contributions by #1 overall picks from Pervis Ellison to Deandre Ayton to their respective draft class. KAT got a +5.36 rating which meant that he contributed to around 30% of his draft class's win shares, which is insane. He was not a steal because as you said, they didn't steal him from anybody and anybody (except the Jah fans) would have taken him at that position. Yet he has still outperformed his draft class by more than a #1 overall should by a lot, which is why his rating is so high. Should the T'Wolves be credited with selecting him if he was so obviously better and ended up fulfilling that potential? Maybe not. My model does its best to not give them *too* much credit by comparing him to #1 overall picks historically who have generally been great. But he's running laps around everyone else in his draft class in terms of counting and especially advanced stats because of how efficient he is and even factoring in his position he comes out as a great pick and hey, Minnesota could have Sam Bowie'd it so maybe they deserve some credit for not."
3014,2020-07-01 10:17:58,hip052,"Lots of #1 picks are way bigger misses than KAT and AD.

There needs to be a way to show the value of picking the right guy, too.

Otherwise you penalize way too heavily for a Fultz and a Bennett, and you don't provide enough separation between good second rounders that aren't really *that* great."
3015,2020-07-01 05:57:53,hip052,"This is true. The idea behind the analysis was that if teams have high value picks they should be getting high value players every time where as having a mid value pick does not necessarily mean they should get high value so when they do it is more impressive than teams with high picks. If a team has many high picks, they probably have not been using them well anyways (except I guess Boston or Philadelphia). I mean ideally a team would draft high once or twice and experience success and not have to draft high again for a while instead picking later in the draft. This is kinda what the Pacers do where their only lottery picks this decade have been Paul George and Myles Turner and the rest of their picks are either in the middle or end. 

Essentially, my response to you is that I consider nailing high picks and middle/end picks to be equally valuable, it's just that what the definition of nailing means changes."

[Someone did try to disprove this but I wasn't convinced by their post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/5veixd/the_myth_of_genius_drafting_matt_lloyd/) It basicilly amounts to ""we did decently drafting with higher picks after he left, therefore he was not a great scout"" which is a weak argument.

The fact that he was able to get convince Gar Pax to look at so many late round picks that turned in to solid starting caliber NBA players is impressive, full stop. The fact that Gar Pax were mediocre with better draft slots *after* Lloyd left to be an assistant GM with Orlando should also count against the Bulls. Now Lloyd and Orlando did not have the same success but it's hard to tell if that's a difference in duties from head scout to assistant GM resulting in less scouting from Lloyd or if it adds merit to the idea that the Bulls just got lucky several years in a row with guys like Gibson, Butler, James Johnson, relative to guys like Teague, Portis, McDermott."

The only thing I would say is that I think the outliers should count for more, since they do on the court. Denver has taken some big swings on high upside, high downside talent, like MPJ and Bol Bol. It feels like hitting big on one of those is much more valuable than netting a few decent rotation talents."

The guys I talked about weren't high picks MPJ has superstar potential and they picked him up at 14. They gor Nurkic at 16. Beasley was taken 19. Fournier was 20th. Those are higher than the Spurs have usually gotten to pick, but those are still guys that really move the needle, while, with yhe exception of Kawhi, the Spurs' finds are mostly decent rotation guys. Solid, for sure, but is getting Kyle Anderson at 30, really more impressive than picking up someone like MPJ at 14? Also, keep in mind that Denver's home run pick, Jokic, was picked up 11 picks after the Spurs took Anderson.

I'm not trying to bag on the Spurs. They still deserve to be high, but the list of real impact guys that Denver got well below where they should have gone is ridiculous."

3034,2020-06-30 18:23:30,hip052,"Yeah, I think the OP's analysis missed a lot of other factors, because obviously GSW had the best drafting skill just based on assembling their 73-9 team. Looney worked quite well for us, and now it looks like Paschall has a lot of potential."
3035,2020-06-30 22:05:47,hip052,"Looney? By what stretch of imagination does Looney warrant consideration in here. He is a decent role player from the bench at best, and does not contribute much except fills a need for GSW when they lack a big man.  As for the rest of their players during the championship runs, Warriors beefed up their bench with FAs from other teams who were chasing a ring, or came via trades. Think Iggy, Livingston, Lee, Bogut, and the 2x MVP Durant. So this is a good reflection of their drafting sucess in the last 10 years. Of course, if you arbitrarily add 2009 pick Curry into this calc, that would likely move the up the ranking."

Those teams were really really close to beating the Spurs and Thunder who both made the finals.  I’m a Heat fan so I’m my saying the Grizz ever win it all, but the Grizzlies grit-and-grind defense would certainly been an super tight battle.  Gasol on Bosh.  Tony Allen on Wade.  And I’m sure Allen would spend time covering Lebron too, which would’ve been amazing to watch.  I wonder if Gay could cover Lebron.  One article calls Chalmers one of the grit-and-grind players cuz he went to Memphis a couple years after.  It would be cool to see him and Conley go at it as both were gritty tough defenders.  I’m just reading now yang Battier was part of the Grit-and-grind era and helped kicked it off in 2010 right before coming to Miami for 2 rings.  Does he still make that switch if the Grizz are doing better.  What if the Heat can’t get him.  Battier is a good 3-and-d small forward.   That’s kinda crazy actually.   

The Heat big 3 era was the beginning of small ball taking over worn Bosh moving down from PF to C and Batteir coming in as stretch 4 instead of playing the 3 like he had always done.  I wonder how this matches up against ZBo and Gasol down low.  I love Battier, but he can he cover ZBo in the post all game?  Definitely not.  Does Lebron have to cover him?  Do you force us to use 35 year old Birdman for way too long or do we force you to sit ZBo."

Only one team can win every year, many can be entertaining,  but as you could see in an explicit version in Moreyball, for as long as they win, the aesthetic of the basketball is secondary to the Ws.

Most bad GMs don't provide nor entertainment nor wins, because they simply can't.. but their owners will surely judge on the win part.

I quite can't argue on a subjective topic as to what fans want as everyone is different, but to say the Raptors were good without having gone to any finals is to me very far fetched and inconsistent with what actually occurred.

 Were winning 55 regular seasons game enough so they wouldn't have traded DeMar for a one year rental of Kawhi, as winning 55+ every year should have been enough to keep everyone happy no?"
3046,2020-07-01 01:55:22,hip052,"Him too.  Great pick who has still outdone expectations.  He’s unequivocally the best big man in the NBA.  Still not a steal.  Anybody with the first pick would’ve taken him.  Nobody passed on him or didn’t want him.  MKG was a distant, distant 2nd pick.

Now, Damian Lillard going 6th is a steal.  MKG, Waiters, and Thomas Robinson were all picked before him lmao.  

I think one of the problems with this is it needs more specificity to draft class.  Like what about Beal at #3.  Yes he’s way better than MKG and clearly should’ve gone ahead, but Damian Lillard is better and clearly the #2 guy in the class.  Beal should’ve gone 3rd overall still."
3047,2020-07-01 06:22:54,hip052,"It's not just that. The model as is values picking a starter in the late teens / early twenties higher than picking an all-star top 5 basically. So much of drafting in the NBA is about marginal improvements. A player who performs 10% better than another is worth far more than 10% more. 

Also as a totally separate point, don't love win shares as a metric (especially defensive), which I think are changing some results. Can see an [analysis here](https://fansided.com/2019/01/08/nylon-calculus-best-advanced-stat/).

Roster construction is not black and white, the Bulls had a lot of contracts that were impossible to move due to the steep decline of the players and injuries, if they all would have stayed healthy then I can see the Rose, Noah, Deng and young Butler (and was it Boozer the last player?) contend for many years.

Anthony Davis as great as he is, was always getting injured in the playoffs and regular season and if not him, his team mates, while the Pels weren't contenders the lack of continuity stunted the growth and appeal of the team, is it really the team's fault that most players were out? The team was never bad on paper and at some points it was good enough to fight for home court advantage, but then one or two starters would get injured, miss 10 games and the season became a fight for the 8th spot.

What I meant by being another post is that is hard to quantify stuff like that and not a minor adjustment to the current post, OP was clear in that he didn't take into account anything other than results, because team development and good coaching are a thing, some players can rise despite those being negatives and others need the help of the whole system to become good, and others like Lebron in Miami, need a team in a big market willing to spend to get a ring, because there never was a doubt that Lebron, barring any big injury, was a sure fire top 25 player in history, even while in the Cavs."
3051,2020-06-30 23:28:27,hip052,Fair enough. I missed that.
3052,2020-06-30 21:44:38,hip052,He was a solid dependable *starter*. Around 2010 we had guys like Perkins and Bynum and Gasol and KG as C/PF in the finals - you didn't need range back then.
3053,2020-07-01 01:36:24,hip052,I have a hard time believing the pick not landing for Detroit from the Otis Thorpe trade in 1997 is what set the Pistons back this decade.
3054,2020-07-01 05:02:39,hip052,Can you really know if he is on the terrible pistons?
3055,2020-06-30 22:43:49,hip052,And again curry was drafted 09 so that impacts in the ranking of THIS decade
3056,2020-07-01 16:44:05,hip052,Warriors don’t beat the rockets in the playoffs the last two years without Looney
3057,2020-07-01 04:05:46,hip052,"Looney is a switchable center that can guard Harden and was pivotal for Golden State in 2018 and 2019 Playoffs. Him at that price, if he is healthy, is probably one of the biggest value contracts in the League. And you argument about FA's is just insane, every team in the league signes free agens or makes trade.

In 2015-2016 - 4/5 starting players were drafted by the Warriors - that 80%

In 2017-2019 - 3/5 starting players were drafted by the Warriors + Looney emerged 

There is hardly other team that drafted better than GSW this decade"
3058,2020-06-30 20:51:32,hip052,"Yeah, Battier was past his prime when he left for Heat. He was in Memphis for the early part of his career, was traded in the deal for Rudy Gay and ended up coming back later. Thing is, we had Rudy Gay who was supposed to be a star SF. Just never materialized. Didn't want it enough.

I maintain that if we had beat the Spurs and gotten to the Finals in 2013, we would've beat the Heat. You guys wouldn't have had an answer for Marc and Zbo, I think they would've feasted."
3059,2020-06-30 18:00:47,hip052,"Oh let’s go here again shall we? That is such a simplistic and naïve take on that championship I’m surprised to see it echoed here of all places.

The non kawhi raps made ecf twice and had the unfortunate, yet hardly unique, experience of running up against lebron 3x in 6 straight playoff runs. They are one of the top 3-4 teams in the league this year without kawhi and have 7 seasons with a winning record all while not picking higher than 9th and getting major contributions from pascal (24th, considered a reach), fvv (undrafted), norm Powell (46th, reigning ecpotw) OG (23rd) and Terence Davis (undrafted).

Most of the rest of the league would kill for this level of success."
3060,2020-06-30 20:05:32,hip052,"Well we better remove the Warriors 2015 and 2017 chips then (no Kyrie or KLove, no Kawhi), as well as Miami 2012 (DRose). Injuries happen."
3061,2020-06-30 18:19:22,hip052,"And the Raptors were and are a totally different team now minus Lowry... so what's your point?

Is it the Raptors fault Klay injured himself trying to embellish a call? Injuries happen. Raptors were missing OG as well a top 5 defender in the league this year..."
3062,2020-06-30 20:10:04,hip052,Sorry I was mistaken on when the injury occurred. I thought remembered Klay shooting a three and kicked his leg out to get a call and that's when he injured himself
3063,2020-06-30 21:27:01,hip052,Somebody drop this fool for me
3064,2020-07-01 13:23:27,hip052,"Okay but the raptors never would have won the championship without drafting well, like they did, so mentioning them as underachievers is just completely wrong and undermines the OP’s data, just because you’re salty that Kyle lowry’s thick ass won a chip"
3065,2020-07-01 19:07:04,hip052,"2 teams go to the finals though. It was cavs warriors for like 4 years in a row that doesn’t mean every other team is bad. I’d consider the Rockets to be a consistently great team as well but they never went to the finals. The raptors were able to be a championship team by being consistently good, and being in position to make a move to increase their ceiling. Good teams have that luxury. It’s the same position the 76ers are in now. A ceiling on their team due to a flawed makeup but if they add a well rounded star they can go the distance. 75% of the NBA can’t do that"
3066,2020-07-01 21:51:40,hip052,know what? that he's a good player? i mean it's not like he's the typical volume scorer getting buckets on a shit team. he does things that scale up when playing against good competition.
3067,2020-07-01 16:58:25,hip052,"Like I said GSW has always lacked defensive centers to counter the other team's bigs. That's why GSW's had rotating centers in the last decade - Bogut, McGee, Looney, a bunch of other big bodies seldom used and an assortment of smallball Cs like David West. But being a bit role player don't mean significant contribution to the run."
3068,2020-07-01 16:38:06,hip052,"Denial is unbelievable. Look at the roster. Curry was in 2009, in the 00s. Klay and Green in the 2010s decade, the decade in question. After Green, Barnes contributed a bit, but not during the run, and the rest are bench role players. Only three drafted players made contributions to playoff runs: Curry, Green, Klay. Looney is bench. Looney able to guard Harden? Not even in your dreams pal. He won't be starting  on any other playoff team except Warriors who's always had a weakness at center. Take a look at GSW DRAFT: https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/draft.html"
3069,2020-06-30 20:57:20,hip052,"I don’t know either way.  We can’t cover those guys in the post, but the Warriors and Rockets have been taking bigs out of games with small ball.  I wonder which one wins.  

And Tony Allen is slightly small for Lebron and might be covering Wade more.  How are the Grizzlies supposed to stop Lebron?"
3070,2020-06-30 20:06:48,hip052,"Remains a bad comparison man, you're comparing god damn OG Anunoby to KD.

We're talking about a Lebron level player, not an at best 3rd team All NBA."
3071,2020-06-30 19:14:13,hip052,"Not their fault, but to compare any player on the raptors to KD being injured is laughable.

Probably not champions again in decades though."
3072,2020-07-01 15:20:45,hip052,"You can disagree with one example but I can mention probably over 8 teams with the same problem.

Whether or not I respect the Raptors, doesn't undermine the fact that there is a huge difference between regular season overachievers (this post) and actual champions.

The Utah Jazz drafts very well if you're looking to win games during the regular season.. whereas you have teams like the Heatles where most of the pieces were drafted elsewhere.

Putting regular season success, which is literally achievable by half the league, in the same boat as championship level teams does a disservice to what a championship entails.

So yes, even comparing Kawhi raptors to DeMar raptors makes no sense.. one team with an ""imported"" player did what it is built to do, which is not , I repeat regular season success."
3073,2020-07-01 17:06:53,hip052,"You speak nonsense:

1. Bogut in 2014-2016 will start for most of the teams in the League
2. Bogut, Mcgee and Looney are completely different players with different qualities and roles
3. Looney was amazing in 2018 and 2019. Its obvious you didn't watched series with Rockets or him particular. If he becomes available 29/29 teams will approach him"
3074,2020-07-01 17:02:17,hip052,"Show me one team that drafted overal better players than: Klay, Dray, Barnes, Looney, Parschal?

Looney was wanted by all teams last summer, including Houston, he is an AMAZING defender given his position and qualities.

Barnes contributed a bit?! By starting for one of the best teams in history?
And what about Curry being drafted in 2009? He is not in that disscusion but he is in the one that GSW won mainly because of their drafting"
3075,2020-06-30 21:39:31,hip052,"TA spent years terrorizing KD, I think he would’ve done fine on LeBron that series, with Conley on Wade. Doesn’t matter ultimately."
3076,2020-06-30 20:10:11,hip052,Sure you're replying to the right comment? Merely pointing out that plenty of championships have been swung by catastrophic injuries to other hopefuls.
3077,2020-06-30 20:13:07,hip052,"I wasn't comparing KD to OG. I was just mentioning that we had a significant injury as well. 

KD is great and all but the series definitely goes 7 games if he was  a more ""resilient player"" and who knows from there."
3078,2020-07-01 17:36:00,hip052,Bogut was NOT drafted Warriors. We are talking about DRAFTING ABILITY. Heck teams will approach looney because he is a servicable bench player. He won't get a starting job anywhere for 80 games in the NBA nope. He did good in Rockets series because Warriors needed someone to counter Clint who was killing you guys on the board. Dray couldn't handle Clint. And one series appearance don't count as over-all consistent contribution like starting player. Sure you're in love with him because he's on your team which has lacked consistent reliable big men in this past decade but you can't see the forest for the trees.
3079,2020-07-01 17:22:11,hip052,"Parschal? A volume scorer on a lottery team without any shooters this past year? A defensive sieve who's net rating was -10? When you look at rookies' advanced stats, he's not in top 10. #20 in rookie offensive rating. #22 in rookies defensive rating. #23 in net rating. Only 24 rookies played 15 minutes or more a game in this season; he came in 23rd in net, #20 in offensive rating. Not one we'd pin championships on. 
 Barnes was a high draft pick that wasn't as effective as hoped for (that's why he was shipped out) and was not around when the run began. I give credit for GSW landing Curry, Klay and Dray, but after that, drafts have been laughable. Roster was constructed with value-added FAs and trades. Looney an amazing defender? I have never seen him play amazing on defense, nor have I read ANYWHERE that analysts rate him as an amazing defender. He is adequate, and he is mobile enough for center-challenged Warriors, but not more than an average role player."
3080,2020-06-30 23:26:01,hip052,"Conley is good cover for Wade too and KD is more of a perimeter player than Bron is.  KD still really skinny and that was younger KD who was even skinnier and less muscular and just less developed.  KD really hit his absolute peak after the big 3 was over and maybe by the last year of grit-and-grind.  That finals loss and then not getting back made KD and much better player.  Bron is way bigger and stronger and was really in the perfect prime of his career.  Can’t compare KD right before his prime to peak Bron in terms of physically, experience, and control of the game."

3108,2020-06-30 15:10:43,hiof40,I've talked to two bishops about these kind of issues.  One bishop was great and super supportive.  One was not.  It's a crap shoot.  I'd recommend not doing it.  The potential benefit is relatively small.  The potential negative is very large.
3109,2020-06-30 15:44:56,hiof40,"The following conversation occurred when I moved to a new ward. I had just served 5 years in a bishopric and had been studying church history for 18 months:

Bishop: I’d like to call you to be our YM
President. 

Me: I’m not so sure that’s a great idea. I’ve been studying a lot of church history and I have some very significant concerns about Joseph Smith. I don’t want to cause any problems for the young men. 

Bishop: Oh! Well, I’ve heard all that stuff before. Let’s meet at my house and I can resolve all of your concerns. 

Me: Well, I don’t think it will be that easy, and I don’t want to cause any problems for you, and...

Bishop: Nonsense! Come over on Monday night and we’ll talk about everything. I know about all of the anti-Mormon arguments against the church. 

 - 9 hours, between 2 meetings, of conversation then occur -

Bishop: I had no idea that there were this many problems. This is causing major problems to my testimony. I need to stop looking at this stuff. Can I ask you a favor, that we never have another conversation about church history?

Me: sure"
3110,2020-06-30 16:09:45,hiof40,"My bishop that I talked to about my concerns on my way out is such a warm, kind, truly good, genuinely loving human. 

I did not enjoy my conversations with him about my concerns. He was obviously given no training how to deal with broken shelves. He just kept telling me to pray, read the BoM, etc. He seemed to have full confidence that if I did those things I would come back into the fold.

 He didn't have anything to say about church history, polygamy, or any of it. He thought maybe it was a fellowshiping issue, so he got people to gently love bomb me. I asked him to stop and told him how much I like the people in the ward. I had not been offended or ignored. He had no idea where to go from there. Theeennnn Covid showed up.

Now I'm a happy apostate."
3111,2020-06-30 16:27:49,hiof40,"I had some very similar concerns at the start of my journey. I was the ward mission leader and just couldn't do that calling anymore.

What worked for me was exercising some good boundaries with the bishop. He doesn't need to know why you can't do your calling anymore, even though he'll probably ask. In my case, I told my bishop:

”Thank you for the opportunity to serve. For personal reasons I'm not comfortable discussing, I am no longer able to fulfill my calling as I would like. Because of this, I am resigning from my calling effective <date>.""

He doesn't need to know more than that! And whenever he asks why you can repeat ""personal reasons I don't feel comfortable discussing with others"". There's a high likelihood he'll ask you to stay in your position longer as they look for a replacement (which tends to get delayed longer and longer), but again you can set a firm boundary that your chosen date is immoveable.

Whatever happens, good luck and sending you best wishes wherever your journey takes you."
3112,2020-06-30 15:41:49,hiof40,"I met with my bishop as I was leaving the church. I had made up my mind and telling a “Priestoood leader” felt like a way to find closure.

I broke the guy’s heart. He almost cried a couple of times. He asked me to meet with him again, “just to talk,” and said, “I can be whatever you need me to be.” 

I have no doubt he’s a good man and I still feel bad for making him sad for my own closure, which I didn’t get. But the church’s truth claims and attitude toward those who hear the teachings and reject them is what made that experience so hard for him. It’s a stark reminder of how toxic the church and its hard lines can be. 

Anyway, every bishop is different and I’m not advocating for one way or another. Just sharing my story."
3113,2020-06-30 16:33:28,hiof40,"When I talked to leaders of my local ward, they had no answers.

But I've heard of other places where the bishops are aware of the issues.

It's roulette for sure.

My advice, and it's just advice, would be to try and keep things together for a while as you research. I made the mistake of just talking to my wife (and local leaders) when everything was fresh and raw and I just was not in an emotional place to have a good conversation with anyone.

Now the answers I *was* given were not good ones... it's basically the FAIR type apologetics, but I just couldn't respond calmly to answers that were bad answers.

So for me I would take some more time and get a better handle on where you are in this and then you'll be able to more calmly talk to your Bishop if you want to be released or however you want to move forward.

If you have any questions on church stuff, message me anytime and I'd be happy to let you know what I've written on it and other podcasts/resources that I found helpful.

Good luck!"
3114,2020-06-30 14:50:13,hiof40,"Well that is leadership roulette. It depends from bishop to bishop. When i told the bishop he tried to figure out if there was some underlying reason that I had doubts other than the typical shelf items. Long story short, he said he didn't want to cause any unnecessary tension within my family and said to let him know if I needed anything. It wasn't a terrible experience.

In my experience, people are more likely to steer clear of you once you indicate you are doubting rather than to make you a project. But other people might have a different experience."
3115,2020-06-30 15:44:37,hiof40,"Good luck and welcome to the road to apostasy!

It's good you are thinking through things like this. Young mens is a really hard place to be. I was young mens president when I finally allowed myself the possibility that it might not be true. And on the one hand you feel like you can do so much to help the boys avoid the crushing guilt and shame and be healthy and happy, but at the same time when topics like Joseph come up you want to stand up and shout about Helen Mar Kimbel, the BoA, etc, etc, etc. 

What do you hope to gain from telling the Bishop? Counsel? Answers (hint, he doesn't have any to the actual important questions other than read and pray and maybe a ""I was troubled too but ended up strengthening my testimony through my doubts"" or something."")? 

If you are looking for a place to have a genuine conversation in your ward, there isn't one. Which is SO SO unfortunate. You're just starting out down a very very deep rabbit hole. If I were you, I wouldn't tell my leadership until I wrapped my own head around what I want to get from talking to them. I have a feeling when you do you'll be pretty disappointed and they WILL have issues with you teaching young men. They are seen as too vulnerable."
3116,2020-06-30 16:02:23,hiof40,"Bishops have zero training on how to care for people in a faith transition. I think the biggest thing to remember is that you control the situation. This is your faith journey and no one else’s. My wife has started going through a faith crisis of her own and simply asked the bishop to be released from her calling as a young women’s adviser, for some of the same reasons you cited. Our bishop does not get involved with people who have a crisis of faith, but we have not sought him out, because we instinctively know he won’t understand. Your bishop might be different, but I do think that your gut instinct about how you think your bishop might react should be heeded, should you decide to go talk to him. That gut feeling would at least prepare you for any minimization or gaslighting he may attempt, like so many church leaders do."
3117,2020-06-30 15:17:25,hiof40,"I had this same dilemma last year. I had all the same concerns you had. 

For me, I chose to not share specific issues with my leaders because I knew they would just fall on deaf ears. During my meeting with my stake president he asked me to bare my testimony of the the church, BOM, and Joseph Smith. I kept it brief and tried to keep it positive. You know, like ""I loved being a member of the church and it helped me, but now I know it is not what it claims to be. The Book of Mormon helped me, but now I know it is not a literal account of ancient Americans. Joseph Smith..."" I actually refused to talk about Joseph Smith because I didn't have anything nice to say. 

My game plan was that I didn't want to appear to be an enemy of the church, because I didn't want my family to become pariahs, so I kept things as positive and as vague as I could while simultaneously making it known that I do not believe that the church is what it claims to be. It was a hard line to walk, but I feel I played my cards the best I could.

The result: Yes, I'm now kind of a project. The missionaries started dropping by unannounced. People would drop by and make sure my kids had a ride to mutual, but my kids eventually stopped going to church and the ward has pretty much left them alone and hasn't tried to reactivate them. My wife still goes and is treated fairly well. 

What's weird is that my elder's quorum president has never reached out to me and he lives  a few doors down. My new bishop has left me alone and never asked me why I don't come, even though we used to serve together when he was in the high council and I was in the EQP. 

When I attend church on special occasions only one person in the ward  talks to me, the rest avoid eye contact with me. I kind of get the sense that people are afraid of me. Maybe it's because I am wearing a colored shirt and no tie, or maybe it's because the rumor mill has told them I'm ""anti"". 

Either way, I am glad I came forward and am living an authentic life and standing for truth."
3118,2020-06-30 15:52:05,hiof40,"Yeah, I had no choice in speaking to my Bishop during my awakening. I was the EQP, and I could not in good conscience continue teaching and testifying to something that I no longer believed in. Your Bishop most likely does not have any answers for you. You are completely justifed in asking to be released and not giving a reason. Your calling is voluntary and you can quit at any time, despite what some GA or other may have said in some talk or something. If God is real and wants you to understand Him, he'll understand your need to take care of your mental health while you figure this all out. Also, yes, you need to look at the so-called ""anti-mormon"" literature, but I will always say this, ""Look at it and the faith-promoting information with the same skeptical eye. Find the facts, and follow the rules of logic, if God exists, he gave you a wonderful critical thinking brain, using ones feelings is fine, but I find that we can believe things that are not true based on feelings alone. Good luck."
3119,2020-06-30 16:21:58,hiof40,"I feel your pain. It's really tough to navigate all of this, for sure.

Eventually, there will come a breaking point where your integrity and authenticity will crash head-on with what the Church wants of you. It sounds like it's already happening, but if it isn't this calling, it will be a temple recommend interview, tithing settlement, etc. So, are you just delaying the inevitable? 

I had the same issue you did (I was in the Bishopric when my concerns started). I eventually had to ask to be released. I was pretty up-front about why. They immediately tried to give me other callings and assignments to keep me in. I suddenly had people I hadn't talked to (but who were on the ward council) calling me, saying that I was ""on their mind"" and they ""weren't sure why."" Major eye roll. It was definitely weird being on the other side of it when the magic is gone and I know that the Spirit wasn't magically prompting this random person to call me without any information.

Here is one ironic side-note: people were *much more accepting* when I described my faith crisis in terms of not being sure if I believed in the existence of a God than having concerns about Church history. I got much less pushback and much more understanding and willingness to accommodate when my doubts were about God's existence. If I could go back, I would focus on that element more and Church stuff less when talking to people. I find it extremely odd that people were more put off by me not believing in the Church than me not believing in God, but this happened pretty consistently with leaders and other members.

When I discussed Church-specific concerns (e.g., Joseph Smith), I got a lot of platitudes and hand-waving of my concerns, just as you are anticipating. They never wanted to actually hear what the actual concerns were. They acted as though they were unimportant, or I was mistaken (even though they hadn't even heard the concerns!), and instead just shared talks with me about faith and how the Spirit ""confounds the wise,"" etc. It was infuriating to have them dismiss my concerns without even listening or verifying whether they were true. When talking to believing members about this stuff, it's almost as though my mind starts to go numb because the conversation deviates strongly from any form of logic. So, in short, no, it didn't help to discuss my concerns with members specifically."
3120,2020-06-30 16:26:41,hiof40,"I would talk to him. I feel if you wish to remain sane, it is the only way. Or talk to another leader, but I wont advice to stay in the shadow of your past faith. It will not help you in the long run, even if it is scary to notify your leaders. Just make sure you talk to your loved one(s) first so they don't learn it through someone else.

I know it's super hard. Be brave and I wish you the best of luck. If you need somebody to talk to feel free to PM <3"
3121,2020-06-30 18:51:37,hiof40,Leadership roulette. Also they will notate your file :)
3122,2020-06-30 16:25:39,hiof40,"It was good for me to sit down and break down my real concerns with my Bishop because it really hit things home for me to see the blank look in his face. He said something to the effect of “God blessed me with a simple mind to not ask such questions”, and had zero answers for me. I think we both knew there wasn’t much that could be done for the salvation of my soul so we wrapped the meeting awkwardly. I then went and talked to several other leaders of the church about these concerns, all the way up to a first member of the Seventy (Elder Clarke) and church historian (Matt Growe). I think if you go in knowing that they won’t have any real answers, but just to get closure or get it off your chest, it might be good for your mental health."
3123,2020-06-30 16:40:22,hiof40,"I just told my bishop that, I have a very different view about the church, and I don’t think I am a good fit for teaching the youth Sunday school (I was a youth Sunday school teacher during the shelf breaking) 
And I also asked join my wife in teaching the primary.

“I’ll wake with you” is my favorite primary song; if there’s only one principal I want my kids to learn, this would be the one."
3124,2020-06-30 17:32:10,hiof40,"My wife and I didn’t talk to the bishop. We knew enough to know he wouldn’t have the answers. The deception was way above his position and authority. Those last couple months we rough though because we had a better picture of what really happened compared to the correlated church material. We held in as long as we could then we informed the bishop by email that we would no longer be attending and he would need replacements for our callings. I had spent nearly all my years in young men's and scouting and my wife was the Primary president at the time and doing a great job so I'm sure he was shocked.

We didn't talk to the bishop for another year until we contacted him by email about submitting our resignations. I'm glad we never gave him or anyone else in the ward any details about our departure. 

The gift of the Mormon faith crisis podcast helped us sort out how we wanted to proceed with our faith transition. Ultimately you should do what you feel is best for you. I wish you the best in your journey. Things get better as you work through the grief cycle."
3125,2020-06-30 19:05:04,hiof40,Why talk to a bishop....what could that possibly achieve?
3126,2020-06-30 23:29:28,hiof40,"I'd like to give you some perspective from the other side.

As a bishop, I started out truly believing that I was called of God and that through the Spirit, I was being guided in my ministry. As part of that ministry, I felt compelled to research the concerns about the church that members would share to me so that I could resolve them.

At first I found ways to justify the church narrative, or when the narrative was unsatisfying (which happened frequently), the unofficial apologetics. Over time, I found these answers rang hollow and I began to develop my own concerns.

Over time I allowed for the possibility that what I believed was not true. As I studied things out, as I had been taught since my youth, I came to realize that the church was not what it claimed to be. It wasn't too long after that I became an atheist while still actively serving as a bishop.

This doesn't mean you need to talk to him. You owe him nothing. But if you feel compelled to discuss your concerns, be sincere with him and request the same from him.

You might consider asking him if there's a possibility that you are right about you concerns. If he dismisses them as you fear he will, that tells you a lot and you can end the conversation knowing that it will not be helpful to you.

However, if he takes the time to actually try and understand your concerns and research them, perhaps he will someday join us here. At the very least he might be more sympathetic to the next person that comes to him with concerns."

3128,2020-06-30 18:58:36,hiof40,"I was serving as primary president and attending ward council every Sunday and speaking at baptisms. It got to be to much. I couldn’t do it to myself any longer. My transition spanned a year. I’m a private person so it came down to when I was completely ready to walk away I sent an email asking to be released and Telling the bishop I didn’t want to be brought up in ward council. The email was probably 4 sentences total. I continued to go for two weeks and was released and my whole family walked away with out one person coming to ask us why. I’m SO glad I did it the way I did! (We got a handful of “congratulations- I wish I new how to walk away.”) I’ve continued to have a relationship with a few friends and my husband has too. I’m out of Utah so it’s much easier brake on a ward level. BUT!! I wish someone would unload the garbage on my brother that is a bishop in Utah. He is completely clueless of any historical problems!!! He doesn’t even know what the church essays are. He would never listen to me, I’m out- there for I only have anti Mormon lies."
3129,2020-06-30 21:09:23,hiof40,"Yes you should talk to your bishop.

Continuing to keep this to yourself, could make you feel worse.  For me, from my experience, getting something off my chest was a big relief.

Sounds like you already know what to expect so it shouldn't disappoint you when he says it.  At least you'll have the answers.  Any maybe he'll surprise you.  

The word will likely get out anyway.  If you don't want to become a project, best to tell them up front and be firm.  It is human nature for people to want to help those they think need help or wavering, regardless of the issue so, if you can, take it in stride and consider all the people who care about your well being."
3130,2020-06-30 21:36:25,hiof40,"Depends on what you want out of the discussion?

A: Talk you back into the faith?  Seems like this is the only possible position the Bishop could take.  Likely the message will be to ignore the past, pray harder, and read the scriptures.  The issues won't be addressed.  Its highly doubtful that he has any good explanations.  The Church has known about many of the problems with the historicity of the BoM for a century thanks to B.H. Roberts but they still have not put forward any answers to resolve those.  We are going on several years since the aggregation of questions popularized in the CES Letter without a compelling response to the majority and most serious questions.  

B: Sympathize or even agree with you?  Seems unlikely.

C: Get released from your calling?  Many will disagree with this approach but I met with the Bishop to let him know that I no longer believe in the Church and that I wanted to be released.  I also handed him my temple recommend telling him that I can't honestly answer give the ""acceptable"" answers.  I felt that was the right way to handle it.  

D: Stay active in the Church as a non-believer?  Definitely a possibility.  I have a friend who is an open agnostic who has remained active.  This path certainly has difficulties though.  He has been seen as a threat by some of the local area leadership.  

I would say that only you can make the decision on what is right for you.  Inform the bishop of your decision.  If you ask their opinion the bishop will give the same answer as a Muslim cleric , ""stay in the boat.""  They made their decision.  That doesn't mean it was the right decision."
3131,2020-06-30 21:54:13,hiof40,"Feeling the need to be open with your bishop is a conditioned response. Many people who have struggled with their testimonies have faced the exact same struggle. Where I'm at now, I find it amazing that I ever felt the need to tell the bishop so many things about my private thoughts and actions but I was in your shoes at one time.

While I would love to tell you to forget the bishop and move on, I have found that doing what I believe is right helps me move forward better than fighting my own impulses. If you really feel the need to talk to him, then I would say go ahead although I would also caution you to be prepared to walk out if he gets nasty. If you are ready to do that, then there's nothing to be concerned about--unless you think your bishop will physically restrain you or something.

For my own experiences with bishops, I had two good ones. With the first I had the amusing experience of watching him try to defend the church in several different ways only to trail off each time as he realized that what he was saying wasn't really valid. The second bishop didn't agree or anything but decided that he would let me be so long as I wasn't trying to turn anyone away from the church. I know many people have had bad experiences but I fortunately got a couple of good ones."
3132,2020-06-30 22:07:54,hiof40,"I'm PIMO, and I have not talked to the bishop about it. If I did, I would be barred from all priesthood activities and the temple. As the only living priesthood holder for both my and my wife's family, many would have their hearts broken. To me right now, it isn't worth it. I would hurt a lot of people I care about for a very small return. One day when it no longer matters for one reason or another (maybe one of my sisters bring in another priesthood holder, or maybe other people leave a bit), I'll come out. 

In the end, the bishop has the power you give him. You seem to have a grasp of the consequences, so ask yourself; is the emotional benefits of not hiding how you feel worth essentially never getting another chance to speak at Church again? That's a question only you can answer because everyone's situations are different. I would wait to talk to him until you're sure that the benefits outweigh the detriments."
3133,2020-06-30 22:28:51,hiof40,"None of his business. Be there for the YM, to help guide and direct them. Bishop has his hands full. It’s a COLT."
3134,2020-06-30 22:38:43,hiof40,"When my shelf broke, I had just turned 18, and had been called as a primary teacher. I was teaching 10-11 year olds and as I was teaching lessons, I was having major issues with the things I was teaching them. I started to notice the brainwashing aspects that I might have been pushing on these kids. So, feeling uncomfortable, I went to my bishop asking to be dropped from the calling. He basically told me 

Keep teaching the kids. You don’t have to bear your testimony, keep reading your scriptures and praying. You’re a valuable part of this ward and it’d be a real shame to see you go.

Less than a year later I was out. 

I think it’s valuable to speak to your bishop just to put the cards on the table. After that it’s up to you. Good luck!"
3135,2020-07-01 00:57:27,hiof40,"I talked to my bishop, but I knew he would be understanding. I wouldn't have bothered if I didn't think he would react the way he did.  Remember, it can't be taken back once it is out there.  Make sure you are ready for that.  If you don't feel comfortable holding your calling, ask to be released for personal reasons.  You have a right to do that!"
3136,2020-07-01 03:44:49,hiof40,"One of the first things I did when I started doubting the church was to talk to my bishop. It was originally my mother's idea, as I had voiced some of my concerns to her and she suggested I speak to my bishop. I expected pretty much what you seem to, the usual fast and pray, study harder, etc etc, but what I got was quite the opposite. He said he totally supported me, and was there to answer any questions I might have, and if I ultimately decided the church wasn't for me, that would be ok and he'd still be my friend. I did ultimately leave the church, but he was true to his word and we still talk regularly. I even help him every now and then with his beehives that he keeps lol. Obviously, that was my unique personal experience, and it all depends on the bishop. However, I wouldn't assume anything, most of the time people like that are just as confused and have just as many questions as the rest of people, deep down. Worst case you do talk to him, and he says exactly what you expect, but you put in the effort and tried. Best case, he understands and empathizes and you'll have someone to support and help you through your crisis. I wish you luck :)"
3137,2020-07-01 04:19:41,hiof40,I heard some good advice.  You don’t owe any explanations if you don’t want to give them.  People’s reactions when it comes to the Church are too unpredictable
3138,2020-07-01 06:24:43,hiof40,"Strengthen the youth by teaching them how to properly parallel park. Or saving money/budgeting. Or resume writing. You can do all of those things without saying ""I know ABC...XYZ is true."""
3139,2020-07-01 12:52:23,hiof40,"Two thoughts:

* Tell him and be explicit with your concerns about not being heard, becoming a ward project, or becoming the subject of gossip. Make it clear that this is difficult for you, and that the above three scenarios are only going to make things worse.
* Don't tell him, and tell him you would like to be released. Don't ask to be released—tell him you are releasing yourself and they need to find a replacement by X date. Just say it's for your own mental health and you don't really want to get into it right now.

I struggled through my ""truth adventure"" (aka faith crisis) in private for the better part of a year while serving in a ward council calling. It wasn't fun and it caused a lot of discomfort. Ultimately, I did tell my bishop, and it was not helpful in the least. He had nothing helpful to say (keep praying for answers and reading the Book of Mormon!), and was entirely unaware of the issues (I introduced him to the Gospel Topics Essays). I told him to release me a few months later, and thereafter I immediately became a ward project. Moreover, my spouse also became a ward project of a different type, as they ramped up ""ministering efforts"" to keep them from being led away by their apostatizing partner.

Your bishop may be different than mine. I actually think my bishop is a generally understanding, nuanced guy, who I would have expected to have responded better. Yet his zeal for the church and for his calling won out in the end and resulted in more problems for me. That said, I'm glad I told him because it pushed things along and expedited my faith transition. I also felt able to be my authentic self at church and in public sooner than had I kept things private for longer. In truth, I would do the same again, except be even more direct and probably do it sooner."
3140,2020-07-01 16:21:13,hiof40,"This is a built in problem with the church.  Simply because of a title they are given, members assume bishops have some sort of special ability to help in situations like this.  They do not.  
I got to speak with the current Presiding Bishop of the church shortly after I left.  He had no answers for my questions and had a total lack of knowledge when it came to any historical questions. 

Leadership in the church does not give you any extra inspiration or knowledge.  Talking to any church leader does nothing.  They are just regular people like you and I."
3141,2020-06-30 17:36:58,hiof40,"Here's my experience

Me: Bishop, I'm having significant concerns about early church history and don't think I want a temple recommend right now

Bishop: But don't you see, you can never figure out the truth of these things. It's like Hillary Clinton's emails. That just happened and all the both-sides-ism makes it impossible to tell the truth. You just need to pray harder and listen to the spirit.

Me: I think I'm gonna go now..."
3142,2020-06-30 17:03:53,hiof40,"This depends on your goal. 
Many who have expressed doubt,confusion, truth seeking go into “court of love.” Regardless of the amount of agitation, you run the risk of being shunned. Some have expressed concerns are left alone if they leave everyone else alone. It’s called leader roulette. 

So if the goal is to gain knowledge and assurance don’t speak the bishop. 

If the goal is to be released for your own integrity and the consequences are something you can tolerate, go go it. 

If the goal is to get things off your chest and vent/ask questions find a friend online or in person whose walked this path already. Your bishop is not the one.

Those who express doubt are not made into projects, you are often treated like the plague. Projects are for those being introduced to the religion or the less active."
3143,2020-06-30 18:53:40,hiof40,I would suggest Mormon stories podcast or YouTube
3144,2020-06-30 19:36:27,hiof40,"Personally, I like the idea of going on record with church leadership. These guys (yes, it’s always guys - duh) need to be exposed to this. They need to know why people are questioning and why people are leaving. The bishops that have an excellent grasp of church history are few and far between, in my experience. 

I’ve told this story before. While I was in a bishopric, we were doing our regular weekly visits to inactives. We went to an inactive woman’s house. She was about 25 years old. She very politely told the bishop and me that she had massive problems with Joseph Smith and that she would never return to church because of this. 

The bishop and I (both very ignorant on church history) returned to the car and had the “can you believe she had a problem with Joseph smith ?!?!” conversation. We couldn’t fathom how someone would have any heartburn over joseph Smith. 

It wasn’t too long after this that google introduced me to polyandry and I went down the church history wormhole. I then remembered my conversation with the 25 year old inactive woman. Turns out, she knew far more about Joseph smith than the bishop and I did."
3145,2020-06-30 17:00:48,hiof40,"Yup. If you intend to keep any relationships in the ward intact, don’t go to the bishop."
3146,2020-06-30 16:59:44,hiof40,"Saaaaaame.

Moved into a new ward, called into the EQP. “Hmmm, I don’t know if I’m the best for this calling, you see...”

Bishop didn’t have time to discuss it all at once, so let’s schedule another meeting and come back to all of this.

Where my story differs from yours was that my bishop at the time refused to admit that any of these things were problems, and straight up tried to refute some of them (even though I was reading directly from the sources in the footnotes provided in the church essays). 

It all ended after 3 or 4 meetings when I realized he wasn’t really there to listen to my concerns, or even attempt to answer any questions. He was there to give me the primary answers. “Are you praying as a family? What’s your testimony of the restoration? Are you reading your scriptures”. Because at the end of the day, that’s all they have to offer."
3147,2020-06-30 20:37:05,hiof40,"The Bishop now has a real problem.  He chose the blue pill.  But in the Matrix the blue pill made you forget that the red pill exists.  In real life picking the blue pill leaves you remembering that there was a choice. Worse, there is still a choice. And now every time he encounters a lame apologetic or a whitewashed story he will be reminded that the choice is still there."
3148,2020-07-01 19:26:41,hiof40,"Your feelings about being helpful versus authentic are what I struggle with as a closet non-believer.

It does feel helpful to have people (especially youth) not have every member give them doses of toxic perfectionism and guilt. On the other hand, it's hard to ""bear testimony"" of things -- I try to stay pretty generic and talk about principles that are true that overlap with the gospel (being hopeful, dealing with trials step-by-step and not running faster than we have strength, etc) but topics like LGBQ issues and Joseph Smith praising are really hard to deal with.

Also, I feel bad if people see my activity in the church as some sort of encouragement for them to stay -- I'm stuck for family reasons.  I do see some good done by some good church teachings and by the social network, but I feel like the cost of church activity (insane busywork, guilt, shame) is WAY too high for the minimal benefit that people get out of it."
3149,2020-06-30 15:47:35,hiof40,"Wow, I could definitely see my Bishop feeling inspired to have me bare my testimony. I’m a RM, served in clerk  callings, member from birth. That would make me feel incredibly uncomfortable! 
What events led you to have a meeting with the stake president?? Did you speak to your bishop and then he set up a meeting with the stake president?

If I wasn’t serving in such an active calling right now I’d not be very inclined to have a chat with Bishop.
Perhaps I could ask to be released but be vague about the reason.. but that doesn’t feel too right."
3150,2020-06-30 19:10:32,hiof40,"I think the lack of concern may stem from the fact that doubt in God is a universal problem (or rather common amongst all religions), and that problem can be solved in many places and leaves the possibility of return. 

Doubt in the church leaves little possibility for return to the church,  and spiritual fulfillment may be found elsewhere.  General problem vs specific,  personal problem. 

At least that's my take."
3151,2020-06-30 22:02:28,hiof40,"I’m curious about your meeting with Elder Clarke and Matt Growe. Do you mind sharing what that was like, what they had to say, etc?"
3152,2020-06-30 19:56:58,hiof40,"Please review our rules on the usage of the word ""cult"""
3153,2020-06-30 20:03:58,hiof40,"I mean, you're not wrong.  But I think every person has to weigh the personal cost that they'll pay for doing this.  My first bishop was great, and I paid no personal cost.  My second bishop didn't handle it too well, and I ended up being shunned by some members of my ward.

I guess I'd ask the question, what do you want to accomplish by meeting with your bishop?  As you point out, most bishop's simply won't be fully knowledgeable about all of these issues.  So do you end up teaching the bishop all the problems?  Is he willing to listen to you?  Do you intend to plant seeds of doubt in the bishop's mind?

What do you expect to get out of the meeting, and what is the cost that you might end up paying?  Those are important questions to address."
3154,2020-06-30 19:29:15,hiof40,"So, it may have gone something like this?

You: “the priesthood restorations were actually never mentioned until 1834, which was 5 years after they allegedly took place.”

Your bishop: “are you praying as a family?”"
3155,2020-07-01 21:19:42,hiof40,"Honest question, how many people do you think are in our exact same situation in an average ward? It seems like every single day there are a few posts that I could have written verbatim. 

You could be in my ward and I wouldn't know. I feel like it's getting to the point that if we all spoke up SOMETHING would have to change."
3156,2020-06-30 16:59:44,hiof40,"I was serving in a stake calling at the time, so I wanted to tell the stake president first and ask to be released. 

Here's the weird part. His first counselor called me a few days later and told me they decided not to release me. He told me they thought it was best to leave me in the calling but I didn't have to do anything. It was their way of sweeping it under the rug without drawing too much attention to me. I just checked a week ago and I am still in that calling according to the web page.

I'm guessing you're curious what my calling was/is. It was officially called ""stake welfare specialist"", and my job was to run an addiction recovery meeting. I also toured the stake speaking in other wards and spoke in stake conference. Many of the bishops called me on a regular basis for help. They didn't want anyone to ask why I was released, so they have never released me. I had to keep redirecting the bishops to the new guy for the first month or so, but it's been quiet ever since."
3157,2020-06-30 21:24:11,hiof40,"Yeah, you could be right. It always felt weird. If they cared about my welfare, I'd assume that faith in Christ would be priority number one. I even had a Stake Presidency member who knew about all my issues say that I should keep coming to Church even if I don't believe any of it because of the social value. It just felt out of wack to have him emphasize weekly attendance over a legitimate relationship with God. And yeah, I know that maybe his reasoning was that if I keep attending, maybe faith in God will return. It just felt like he wasn't as concerned about that."
3158,2020-07-01 01:08:25,hiof40,"It was embarrassingly the same shit as when I sat down with my bishop. Ignorance and special pleading from top to bottom. I recorded the whole thing. Do u have any specific questions? We talked about: the Holy Ghost, Polyandry, the witnesses of the BoM & modern prophesy."
3159,2020-07-01 23:45:24,hiof40,"Man, how unhealthy is an organization that makes you afraid to all questions?"
3160,2020-06-30 22:06:56,hiof40,"Nearly verbatim. He wasn’t listening to my concerns at all. Every concern or issue brought up just prompted a question regarding how I might be failing to live the gospel. It was like something out of Curb Your Enthusiasm, it was so absurd."
3161,2020-06-30 21:21:44,hiof40,"That's pretty much how it goes, yeah. It may sound something more like ""when we see things that disturb us, possible discrepancies in historical records, it is important to stop for a moment and check in with our Heavenly Father. It is he who guides us, our best way of knowing the truth of difficult matters. It helps to gather loved ones around you and pray as a family - to seek Heavenly Father's guidance. Such guidance is forever and always superior to the works of man""

Sounds better, but there's really no difference between that and ""Stop reading that crap, I don't know how to answer it, and just ignore any evidence that doesn't fit with the church's story, AKA God's message. Are you praying as a family? 'Cause you don't want your wife & children to feel as uncertain and bad as you do right now, right? Better start ignoring those problems."""
3162,2020-07-01 22:09:27,hiof40,"I think in many wards there are maybe 4-5 adults like me, with still others who are not in the atheist or mentally out category but are social members who don't think about the doctrine that much and just coast along.

I agree if everyone spoke up a few would leave, but I suspect the majority still believe and don't think too hard about the hard issues -- even if apologetics are weak, they help people feel the church is plausible and that someday we'll understand better and they just go with the times they felt good/happy about the church."

[**Mountain Man**](https://www.audible.com/series/Mountain-Man-Audiobooks/B00JLKUOUG) is a gritty, pulpy audiobook series about surviving the zombie apocalypse. You can try out a free short story prequel called [**The Hospital**](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Hospital-The-FREE-Short-Story-The-First-Mountain-Man-Story-Audiobook/B00IRI3JIW) and see if you like it.

 [**Nights of the Living Dead**](https://www.audible.com/pd/Nights-of-the-Living-Dead-Audiobook/B073KP4ZF1) is a zombie anthology of short stories that are all connected to the original 1968 film. Authors include George A. Romero, Mike Carey, Mira Grant, Jonathan Maberry, and there are unique narrators for all the stories, including the ever-popular Ray Porter.

[**Cell**](https://www.audible.com/pd/Cell-Audiobook/B0036MRIRM) by Stephen King, narrated by Campbell Scott, is about a cell-phone signal turns people into zombies.

I haven't listened to **We're Alive**, so I don't know if any of these is a perfect match...

""Ex-Heroes"" by Peter Cline's 

""Warm Bodies"" by Isaac Marion

""Feed"" by Mira Grant

""Husk"" by Corey Redekop

""Cell"" by Stephen King

""Patient Zero"" by Jonathan Mayberry


None of these is a run of the mill Zombie apocalypse novel. Each has their own twisted take on the genre and they're all wonderful."

3215,2020-06-30 13:48:30,hing84,Where can I listen to is? I found “We’re Alive Goldrush” in Podcasts.
3216,2020-06-30 16:21:51,hing84,Check out the Extinction Cycle series by Nicholas Sansbury Smith or The Remaining series by D.J. Molles.  Both are pretty good and sound like what you are looking for.
3217,2020-06-30 16:37:00,hing84,I liked The Remaining series.  It’s not the best writing or narration to be honest but it is entertaining and they were cheap when I bought them.
3218,2020-06-30 19:04:57,hing84,"I loved We’re Alive! Some good gritty audiobooks would be Arisen series, Mountain Man, Joe Ledger series(or just book 1), and Helldivers"

It's like 28 days later + resident evil with lots of military elements."
3222,2020-07-01 00:15:05,hing84,"I second the arisen series, ive actually listened to every book mentioned in this post so far and arisen is best bang for your buck. Adrian's diary was good and mountain man was great aswell, but i felt like the story began to lack in the later books.  Also a huge fan of were alive, but did not find gold rush near as entertaining.
  Also RC Bray is fantastic in Arisen, really brings all the characters to life, as with most of his work.
 ARISEN follows the story of mostly military personnel. Lots of military Jargen and is action packed throughout. So if it was that aspect of were alive you liked then Arisen Fits the Bill.
MOUNTAIN MAN  is more a everyman take on post apocalyptic zombie filled world very easy to see yourself in the situations that he's faced with and if that's what you liked about were alive then thats the way to go. Also narrated by the great RC Bray
ADRIANS DIARY focuses more a group or community and how they pull it together in the zombie apocalypse and if thats what your looking for then its the one. Also throws some supernatural stuff in in the later books.
 Again every thing mentioned so far are great audiobooks."
3223,2020-07-01 02:26:32,hing84,"In case I'm not the only one who wondered, ""We're Alive"" is available as a podcast of about 100 episodes of maybe 25 minutes each.

3224,2020-07-01 12:41:14,hing84,"The Strain by Chuck Hogan and Guillermo Del Toro.  It's vampires rather than zombies, but other than that it's fairly similar.  

The Scabs series by Eric Shelman.  This one is a fairly low-budget production, but the story is unique compared to a lot of the zombie apocalypse novels out there.

Patient Zero by Jonathan Maberry.  First book in a series and the only one that deals with ""zombies"", it's what I imagine you'd get if Michael Crichton and Tom Clancy collaborated on a zombie apocalypse espionage thriller.  Lots of action and guns.

Monster Hunter International by Larry Correia.  As you may suspect from the name, it's a monster hunting series and deals with lots of monstrous humanoid creatures and just monsters.  Vampires, werewolves, zombies, various Lovecraftian abominations, and the employees of MHI have to go kill or contain them all.  I enjoy this series because it has a lot of (sometimes rather dark) humor in the midst of the horror and violence."
3225,2020-06-30 14:28:04,hing84,Best of the bunch is probably Mark Tufo's Zombie Fallout series. Engaging chars that move as a group just like we're alive.

I think it was mainly his sense of humor I just didn't click with. Also, the first book is... well you can tell it's someone's first book. I'm sure he gets better, he has written a ton."
3239,2020-06-30 15:11:29,hing84,"Yeah, the undead behave more like vampires in **I Am Legend**, but it was the first story (or one of the first) to present the undead as an overwhelming horde, rather than just a few individuals. As such, it really helped create the zombie apocalypse genre.

3249,2020-06-30 13:38:21,hinetv,"I had a key for my apartment back in 2012, but nowadays...smart locks are everywhere.

I don't think I'd want to go back to a key, honestly. Without a car, I have zero keys in my pocket, and that's pretty cool, actually

Note: When your smart lock's batteries are low, it'll warn you (strange beeps when you unlock it). Change batteries promptly (and notice how fast it locks and unlocks with new ones)"
3250,2020-06-30 20:53:18,hinetv,"By the way, I’m sure you could buy a mechanical lock and replace your electronic one. If you’re not the owner, however, you should save the old lock and replace it again when you move out."
3251,2020-06-30 13:41:15,hinetv,"Bro, I can pick the kind of lock you're talking about."
3252,2020-06-30 13:43:10,hinetv,I find it quite disconcerting. I know that technically its safer but I really don't feel it compared to using a key.
3253,2020-06-30 23:01:23,hinetv,I want like a door lock I can open with my smartphone. Do they have that kind of thing?
3254,2020-08-21 17:33:27,hinetv,"I just installed a smart lock to my studio, and not my main door as my wife is afraid she would be locked out by mistake and if the batteries are drained. The one I have  has a micro usb port to use a powerbank to jumpstart it in emergencies. Also it comes with two physical keys I have placed safely outside the room in case i need it.

3255,2020-06-30 15:01:30,hinetv,"to add to this, even if the battery runs out completely you can still buy a 9v battery (those rectangular ones) and connect it from the outside to power the lock, pay attention to 2 small circles with a + and - on the surface, that's where you hold the battery"
3256,2020-06-30 13:44:29,hinetv,True. It’s good not have keys to carry around.
3257,2020-06-30 13:43:20,hinetv,"I’ll need to learn that for my next emergency. Anyway my point is why do they need to even start with a smart lock in the first place. 
Most apartments I’ve been to have never changed their code and you can tell which digits they are."
3258,2020-06-30 14:31:15,hinetv,"I think it's more a matter of convenience than safety. Carrying around keys is a burden. Door locks, keyed or digital, do little to prevent break-ins. As the old saying goes ""locks only keep your friends out.""

However, when people are home, they tend to double/triple lock their doors, and the primary locks coupled with the secondary locks are usually sufficient to protect one's person. Why? Because the majority of offenders are burglars and not violent criminals, and don't want to actually engage with people who may be in the residence, which the secondary locks indicate. In the case of something more perilous, the secondary locks provide preparation time for calling the authorities, or just running to the tool box to grab a hammer and getting all ""Misery"" on their asses."
3259,2020-07-01 04:26:19,hinetv,"Yes. There are some models if you enable NFC on your phone and register on the smart-lock. Nowadays, I prefer to use my fingerprint to open the door."
3260,2020-06-30 20:14:11,hinetv,Wow. This exactly happened to me just yesterday!!! Came home from lunch and the lock was dead as a door nail. Hung out in a park until my wife got home and we called a locksmith. Turns out all I needed was a 9-volt battery.
3261,2020-06-30 14:05:20,hinetv,"PSA: You can change the code on your lock anytime you want and, of course, it's highly recommended you do so, especially when moving into a new place or after a locksmith replaces it (and no, I do not think that locksmiths are untrustworthy, especially in Korea; it's just a precautionary measure)."
3262,2020-07-01 00:22:13,hinetv,I'll certainly remember this tip! Great to know
3263,2020-06-30 14:07:07,hinetv,In my case it was not the code but the gears on the inside that would not engage. Basically they told me it was end of life. Whatever the planned obsolescence of a smart door lock is.
3264,2020-06-30 14:10:04,hinetv,"Oh, yea, I get that. Sucks :( But, I was replying to your comment that:

>Most apartments I’ve been to have never changed their code and you can tell which digits they are.

just in case people were unaware."
3265,2020-06-30 14:17:29,hinetv,"Ah. 
I guess neighbours in apartments are usually trustworthy. I once left my main door opened for 30mins (something about too much soju and I went out for some errands) and nothing happened. Then again I’ve heard of break-ins in villas and houses in Seoul so I guess it depends on the area."
3266,2020-06-30 13:12:25,himufs,*“Whatcha gonna do when they call the cops on you?”*
3267,2020-06-30 14:07:17,himufs,It looks like that’s the first time either of them have held a weapon
3268,2020-07-05 11:02:04,himhwb,What’s the smith system again? I pushed it far out of my mind since I did my last CPC
3269,2020-07-05 12:15:29,himhwb,"Aim high in steering, get the big picture, keep your eyes moving, leave yourself an out, make sure they see you. 

Basically, forward planning but according to our firm, you follow the Smith system you'll never have a crash ever."
3270,2020-07-10 23:45:21,himhwb,😂 Well that's bullshit I've been stationery and had someone reverse into me
3271,2020-09-29 20:16:15,himhwb,"Well I’m very much late to replying. But yes, I remember that BS. Whilst it’s somewhat good advice, it’s easy to miss things that are right in front of you and doesn’t in any way prevent a crash."

3275,2020-06-30 11:06:53,hil8b7,Last years Gwynns card was absolutely perfect!!!!   He never left my lineup  batted leadoff or 3rd for me.  I’m a bit disappointed in his card this year   I’m curious to see how he stacks up against the elite OFers
3276,2020-06-30 11:18:44,hil8b7,"If you’re using contact hitters you have to play at the right field, you can’t be playing at shipper or laughing mountain because even there the ball will sometimes not go out, play at bigger fields and lower elevation fields to play too their strengths, and it will keep the ball in the park against those bellis reggies and Griffey’s sometimes"
3277,2020-06-30 11:37:49,hil8b7,They are very serviceable. Anyone that says the are “unusable” doesn’t use them right. If you aim to hit singles with contact hitters they will be very successful. If you aim for Perfect/perfect flyballs you won’t have the same luck
3278,2020-06-30 11:04:51,hil8b7,"They’re not as effective as last year but they’re still viable. For example, the 93 Gwynn is no where near last year’s Ichiro despite having very similar hitting stats. I think the new Gwynn dropping will hit for average more so compared to power compared to last year’s card."
3279,2020-06-30 12:18:41,hil8b7,"Gwynn has been an absolute base hit machine for me at the top of my lineup. He never strikes out and the number of late/bloop hits he gets is insane. I didn't do any of the Padres TA but with how well I hit with 93 Gwynn I'll probably just stick with him. 

I'm trying out Boggs currently at 1B and will give Mattingly a shot too because his card looks pretty good, not sure why people were hating on it. I always like to have a second contact guy a little deeper in the lineup to get a runner for some RBIs."
3280,2020-06-30 11:55:19,hil8b7,"I’ve always been a contact guy. I have had success this year with both brujan and ty Cobb, but I’m slowly moving more towards power. Power guys are just better this year."
3281,2020-06-30 11:59:49,hil8b7,"I've used Victorino and Carew a lot, and Wade Boggs has been my 3rd baseman since he first dropped(though George Brett will take his place) amd they all rake for me. It can get frustrating hitting perfect flyballs that die out on the warming track sometimes but just taking a glance at my stats with all three 

Boggs: 24 games, .340 BA, 8HR, 12 doubles

Victorino: 39 games, .325BA, 13HR, 19 doubles

Rod Carew: 13 games, .333BA, 2HR, 13 doubles. 

 All of these were non moonshot event stats too. So while these cards arent the meta, it balances out cause vision is so high, which allows for bigger contact inner circles. And their speed helps a lot too."
3282,2020-06-30 12:40:45,hil8b7,"Minnie Minoso has been solid for me although I find that contact hitters are kinda unreliable especially on high pressure situations. I feel like with contact hitters, I have no problem putting PCI to ball but I'd have to pray to the RNG gods that it drops to the grass. Unlike with power hitters who you only need to square up the PCI to hit dingers. I still think contact hitters are usable but only one or two in a lineup."
3283,2020-06-30 16:31:56,hil8b7,"They are ok but not great....there's a big dropoff from how they performed last year.  It is especially noticeable if the card has under 40 power as the ball struggles to leave the infield on even really solid hits.

With that said I made Lofton work for a good while due to the speed and the defense, I love Gwynn cards but I don't know if 85 speed is going to be enough of a tradeoff to not have someone else in his place"
3284,2020-06-30 12:05:01,hil8b7,For me the 91 Ty Cobb has been the 93 Ichiro from a year ago.... minus the defense
3285,2020-06-30 12:54:44,hil8b7,I don't think so. I don't want to use someone who will hit perfect flyballs for outs
3286,2020-06-30 12:59:29,hil8b7,No he isnt worth starting cuz pure contact = bad
3287,2020-06-30 11:22:25,hil8b7,"Yup, my feelings exactly."
3288,2020-06-30 11:22:08,hil8b7,Good point.
3289,2020-06-30 11:49:34,hil8b7,You really think moving the wall back will stop belli?
3290,2020-06-30 14:24:03,hil8b7,I think you mean lower elevation fields btw. Shippet and laughing mountain are high elevation fields.
3291,2020-06-30 11:43:37,hil8b7,Whats your experience with them? What RS level and how many AB's and who? Just curious.
3292,2020-06-30 11:11:17,hil8b7,"Yup, I'm there with you.... doesn't that make a significant difference tho? I mean is contact based Gwynn going to really be overtaking Prestige Belli/Mantle/Larry walker? Probably not, which is a bit unfortunate since Gwynn was in my OF all year last year even when I had every card in the game (Gwynn/Griff/Mays)"
3293,2020-06-30 14:22:12,hil8b7,I'm batting nearly .500 with Gwynn but the moment someone brings in the outfield on him its all over.
3294,2020-06-30 12:42:23,hil8b7,They do have big inner circles but it's not because they have high vision. The inner circle is dictated by the contact stat.
3295,2020-06-30 16:36:16,hil8b7,"That's my problem with this Gwynn card. The downgrade in power coupled with the minor downgrade in speed really hurts. If I'm going all contact in this game, they better have super speed and defense..."
3296,2020-06-30 14:00:54,hil8b7,Lol it won’t stop him just maybe slow him down
3297,2020-06-30 14:33:19,hil8b7,Yeah my bad man
3298,2020-06-30 11:53:43,hil8b7,"Mostly events TBH. When I actually play RS I’m in the 750-850 range but I haven’t played as much RS this year. Anyway I have over 150 AB’s with brian roberts, Victorino, and Brujan and you hear people all the time on here say how much they love lofton. Like I said, if you use them as they are supposed to be used, they are good. Everyone tries to hit homeruns with the contact hitters in this game and when they fly out to the track because they have 50 power they are labeled as “trash”"
3299,2020-06-30 11:14:09,hil8b7,"I’m hoping this Gwynn will make my team, but in reality I think he’ll probably end up being on my bench all year. I just can’t see him outperforming Mantle/Springer/Sheffield/Belli/Reggie, but there’s nothing to lose by getting the card so it’ll probably be one of the first I grind for."
3300,2020-06-30 12:44:07,hil8b7,"I thought the size of the inner circle was vision. But when it came to hitting balls, the outer circle was vision amd the inner circle contact"
3301,2020-06-30 12:47:26,hil8b7,"Yeah, it's kinda annoying that a lot of people do not know this, and do not believe me when I say so. I've even heard streamers still say that vision is what dictates inner PCI size"

3313,2020-06-30 08:03:15,hiiuw9,"Liverpool werent promoted from the championship with a squad that needed replacing. 

They had a squad that needed fine tuning, (which was helped by Bouremojth and Barca paying them a small fortune) while most promoted sides need rebuilding."
3314,2020-06-30 08:07:02,hiiuw9,"Think we can all give credit to Liverpool and Klopp for how well they’ve run the club the past few years. A lot of players they bought have exceeded their price tags relative to the market, but what’s more impressive is how much money they’ve received for players, even if you don’t include Coutinho. Sakho, Ings, Solanke, Benteke, and Ibe all went for pretty decent price tags."
3315,2020-06-30 08:32:03,hiiuw9,"And this is why people have started including wages in these discussions, even though fans of certain teams get very very upset when it makes you look less good than only a certain section of your outgoings over a specific period of time do. 

Not taking away from what has been some very impressive business in the market by Liverpool. 

But can you draw direct comparisons to some of those clubs in the title when Liverpool have been spending more than £100m per year more at keeping those players at the club than the likes of Watford and Brighton? Not really"

3318,2020-06-30 09:04:54,hiiuw9,"I think it’s a bit of a nonsense argument this net spend comparison to small teams. They have still spent a ridiculous amount of money including a world record for a defender. Yes they have sold well, but it’s an unfair comparison on teams who will have had to rebuild entire squads and don’t have assets worth hundreds of millions to sell."
3319,2020-06-30 07:55:50,hiiuw9,Really impressive stuff
3320,2020-06-30 08:17:21,hiiuw9,"there is definitely an element of fortune that made the Liverpool squad of today.

But their sporting direction has been great these past few years."
3321,2020-06-30 08:09:45,hiiuw9,"At some point a statement like this becomes very misleading. 

They sold Coutinho for 140m or something, which is at least twice he's worth. They sold a lot of other crap players for 10 to 20m. Ings was only decent one out the lot.

So yeah, they've done a great job, but the luck of the draw has massively gone in thier favour too."
3322,2020-06-30 08:47:29,hiiuw9,"Liverpool do it right, but it's annoying that Klopp regularly gets a pat on the back for the work of his board for breaking even and yet, Arsène Wenger was regularly meemed for it."

I've heard of players & managers passing their peaks & regressing, first time hearing Sporting Director regressing.

Also Edwards works in a committee rather than isolation & we apparently have physicist & aeronautical engineers working on our transfers rather than scouts"
3325,2020-06-30 07:56:22,hiiuw9,Also sold Sakho + Benteke for £50m+ to Palace. £40m of Ibe+ Solanke+Smith to Bournemouth
3326,2020-06-30 08:03:56,hiiuw9,"We did lose arguably our best player at the time because of it, not like it's free money."
3327,2020-06-30 09:09:34,hiiuw9,"fine tuning ? Alisson, Matip, VVD, Trent, Robo, Gini, Fabinho, Salah, Mane - these are the 'new' players in our 1st 11. Only Bobby, Hendo are left in our 1st 11 from the squad Klopp inheritated, squad wasn't a disaster but it was a mix and match of players without a general direction"
3328,2020-06-30 08:08:34,hiiuw9,"I don't get the 'helped by Barcelona and Bournemouth' argument. Were Liverpool not supposed to sell them?

Like, Liverpool were financially savvy and made smart decisions to build a sustainable model to strengthen their squad. Should they have not? And as the article says, Liverpool practically built a whole starting XI from scratch under Klopp so Liverpool rebuilt their squad too, just like the promoted sides"
3329,2020-06-30 09:15:04,hiiuw9,Now look at how much Pep spent at Man City having inhereted a team that were EPL champions!
3330,2020-06-30 08:12:30,hiiuw9,Ings was the only one sold at a price that proved worth it for the buyer
3331,2020-06-30 08:45:55,hiiuw9,"Liverpool's wage bill is close to 300m a year now. 

The other clubs like Brighton etc don't spend even a third of that."
3332,2020-06-30 08:43:51,hiiuw9,I don’t think the real intended comparison is against Watford and co. I think it’s against other top clubs - where Liverpool have this vastly lower net spend and also a lower wage bill.
3333,2020-06-30 08:31:24,hiiuw9,Is it fortune if you keep signing the right players consistently? I'd say it's more good management.
3334,2020-06-30 08:23:13,hiiuw9,"No luck to it.  Michael Edwards negotiated all those deals. The fact they were all good, suggests it’s not down to random luck. There is a consistent causation factor. 

People are also forgetting the shrewd deals. 8mil for Robinson, 42mil for Fabinho, 7mil for Minimino etc."
3335,2020-06-30 08:14:32,hiiuw9,"Liverpool tied Coutinho down to a 5-year contract the same year he was sold, its why he was sold at such a steep price. Like I guess 'luck' is a convenient argument to make instead of crediting the club for premeditating stuff like the best clubs in the world potentially coming in for your best players

Same goes for the guys that they sold for lessers deals like Benteke, Sakho, Solanke, etc. All tied down to long-term contracts making them worth more than they were"
3336,2020-06-30 08:56:46,hiiuw9,"Maybe twice his worth now, but let's not pretend that Coutinho wasn't a great player for Liverpool, and our most creative outlet at the time. That is what he was worth to us and it's a pretty weak argument to make by pretending like we somehow got lucky or robbed Barca"
3337,2020-06-30 09:01:50,hiiuw9,"I mean it's not luck to negotiate super transfer deals for players, and to use that money to strengthen the squad.  Don't know what's lucky about being a good negotiator."
3338,2020-06-30 08:05:18,hiiuw9,">we apparently have physicist & aeronautical engineers working on our transfers rather than scouts

That's interesting. What's the benefit of that?"

Ask Roma fans about Monchi."
3340,2020-06-30 08:02:55,hiiuw9,"Looking at respective clubs finances, Bournemouth may be bigger idiots than Barcelona for giving you 40 million for those players."
3341,2020-06-30 08:15:38,hiiuw9,"> Also sold Sakho + Benteke for £50m+ to Palace.

That didn't really help our finances seeing as we originally paid £50m+ for them too."
3342,2020-06-30 08:14:55,hiiuw9,"Don't get me wrong. 

Doesn't take away anything from the marvelous business Liverpool had done, it was the perfect time to sell him and they made the best signings possible with the income from his sale. 

Hard to argue with the results after Champions League &  Premier League trophies, Liverpool in the past 3 years are a shining example of how to properly run a football club in the modern era."
3343,2020-06-30 08:10:31,hiiuw9,"...but he didn't fit the formation.  
Edit: Someone explain to me how he fit the formation? Cause I certainly don't see it"
3344,2020-06-30 09:17:35,hiiuw9,"But that could be done gradually over nearly 5 years when a good deal became available as you already had PL quality players like Sakho or Morena in all those positions compared to us needing to replace Anya or Parades

Newly promoted sides need to strengthen ASAP or there is a real risk they are relegated."
3345,2020-06-30 08:14:36,hiiuw9,"They had squad players worth money though. Newly promoted sides often dont. 

I'm not criticising their policy which has been amazing, I'm just saying its pathetic to compare it to sides promoted from lower divisions. Compare them with other big rich clubs with existing squads. 

For example: 

We were promoted and spent the first year with a midfield of Watson, Guediora and Behrami etc who were all over 30. We signed Capoue, Hugjes and Doucoure to replace them for just over 20m which is great business, but still results in +20m net spend. 

On the other hand you sell one or two squad players like Solanke or Ings, and it cancels out the net cost of mane or Salah."
3346,2020-06-30 09:18:44,hiiuw9,"I'm not taking away from what liverpool have done at all.

I am just saying comparing them with teams that need rebuilding just paints a false picture."
3347,2020-06-30 08:57:42,hiiuw9,£20m for a player who had played less than 500 minutes of senior football in two seasons is mad though. A lot of clubs would have sold for much much less.

3350,2020-06-30 08:39:41,hiiuw9,"After a certain point you have to say yes, because we've seen hundreds of well run clubs over the years and everyone's luck runs out eventually. 

But you can certainly still applaud them for doing the job well and giving themselves absolutely the best odds for it to work out. But there's still fortune and it won't last forever."
3351,2020-06-30 08:48:58,hiiuw9,Has Minimino shown anything yet though? 7m is obviously peanuts but i've not seen anything that puts him ahead of players like Lallana or Shaqiri.
3352,2020-06-30 08:36:37,hiiuw9,"The fact that Barca's board went insane over Coutinho and made him the third most expensive transfer of all time is not a sign of Liverpool's savvy transfer business, though they have been savvy in other cases."
3353,2020-06-30 08:18:29,hiiuw9,There was a long article few days ago on this sub. Entailing every aspect of the transfer committee.

3360,2020-06-30 10:33:09,hiiuw9,Moreno ? You must be out of your mind
3361,2020-06-30 08:42:01,hiiuw9,"Yeah, I always find it ridiculous using us in these conversations like we should be doing better. We sell our unwanted squad players for less than a million, people pay a premium for Liverpool squad players."

You have to remember he signed in January, and he’s being trained to a new position (Firminho) role. Klopp tends to keep new signings back before unleashing them proper. Think Robinson or Fabinho.

No doubt he will make 7mil look like phenomenal business, even if he just becomes a solid squad player."

“At Melwood, the club’s training complex in a residential Liverpool neighborhood, Graham works in a white-walled room, down a corridor from the coaches and the cafeteria. Tim Waskett, who studied astrophysics, sits to Graham’s left. Nearby is Dafydd Steele, a former junior chess champion with a graduate math degree who previously worked in the energy industry. The background of the most recent analyst to be hired, Will Spearman, is even less conventional. Spearman grew up in Texas, a professor’s son. He completed a doctorate in high-energy physics at Harvard. Then he worked at CERN, in Geneva, where scientists verified the existence of the subatomic Higgs boson. His dissertation provided the first direct measurement of the particle’s width, and one of the first of its mass. Another club might conceivably hire an analyst like Graham, or Steele, or Waskett, and maybe even Spearman. But it’s almost impossible to imagine any but Liverpool hiring all of them.”

Apparently one of them worked at CERN. This article is long, but is very in depth on the Liverpool analytics team, and how it really stands out against every other team in the world."

9.) they have a bottom of the barrel offensive line and chark fails at finding seperation quickly. There’s reasons why he didn’t produce the last half of the season because minshew didn’t get time. 


10.) He didn’t produce in college."

*Throwaway account* 

Quick backstory/history - I come from a large family 9+ people and most of them are married with kids. I grew up non denominational church and my mom is very spiritual. My parents told us that we are the perfect people (sorta hitler-sh) and that no one is better than a Smith. Generic last name obvs not my real one. My siblings and I were homeschooled in an area that was pro homeschoolers so we had a lot of friends. I think that’s why it took me till 16y to start figuring out something was wrong. Everyone around me thought the exact same way. 

This is my first post in this thread so I’m not sure how many details so I’ll give a couple examples. 

Growing up we were told if we ever disagreed with dad it was the same as disagreeing with God. 

Dad constantly belittled us and told us we were worthless and would only be good enough to flip hamburgers. Yet no one is better than a Smith?? I never understood that logic. 

As an older one I started standing up to my parents and older sibling when they would bully younger siblings. My mom is a manipulator so she would take me out to coffee and thank me for helping. I left for college (big culture shock) and tried to spew the hateful rhetoric I grew up with. I thought this was our job as Christians to change people’s mind. No surprise to anyone reading this, people quickly put me in my place. I will be forever grateful so matter how miserable it was. 

Fast forward to now, I am now a strong supporter of LGBTQIA and very vocal against minority discrimination. (To put it lightly) 
My family as a whole is the Karen’s and Kens that you see today. White supremacy, they celebrate Hitlers Birthday, won’t wear masks because it’s “fake news” .. etc 

I have long given up trying to change their minds or being some semblance of logic into their lives but as most of us know... they just like to argue and spread hate. I have stuck around the family playing conversational land mind games in hopes to be a voice of reason to all my nieces and nephews. After 15 years I feel like I can’t do it anymore. I’m constantly belittled over my opinions (that I never vocalize anymore) and the end of every joke. They trash me behind my back which just shreds my heart. I told them that if they do not wear masks for this years reunion I am not coming. No one cared and they sent me links to the conspiracy that is COVID so I can “open my eyes” 

My relationship with my siblings and parents will never be healed but am I an asshole for abandoning the next generation? I am absolutely clueless on what to do next. I know their parents trash me behind my back but I was hoping they would see how kind and loving I am and HOPEFULLY they would come to me if they were ever in a place I was. Lost and confused. Should I suck it up and go always to spend time with nieces and nephews? Or am I the asshole if I avoid family because I’m too weak to take their harassment any longer?

3407,2020-06-30 01:18:12,hiczzq,"Okay, IMO, you’re NTA.

I completely understand WHY you don’t want to go there, since your family sounds like such manipulative assholes who have no consideration for anyone else except for themselves. 

Your childhood sounds a lot like how my own family in a way, except the difference is that they sort of turn themselves around when I start to learn how to put my foot on the ground and we finally decided to compromise between things than to break off relations. Your family doesn’t sound like this, and I’m so sorry that you have such stubborn and ignorant family members, but I’m glad you see the light and is trying to improve for the better. 

And I know I shouldn’t be mad about this, but I doubt your family are even real Christians to begin with, since fake Christians like them is what gives REAL Christians a bad name. They want you to considered your father to be like GOD? The creator of this world, the one that made humans, and the one that cannot to compare to OTHER PEOPLE? No one can be compared to God- not Trump, not your father, NO ONE. My god, if REAL Christians heard of this, they would be considered heretics and your father would be made an example of what idolatry would have been like.

“Treat others as you would like others to treat you” REAL Christians are suppose follow by that rule, and if your family want to act like a bunch of hateful fools, then it’s best to keep your distance or to go NC if you want to. 

I do sorry for your siblings, and I love hearing how you took your position as the oldest sibling seriously to protect your siblings- very admirable, and I hope the understand your reasoning as to why you don’t want to come. And if they don’t, I really hope they eventually turn around since you sound like you love them a lot. But if they end up growing up to be like your parents, then there’s nothing you can do and you would have to decide if you want to keep them around afterwards.

Best of luck to you, and know that you’re more stronger for sticking to your views and trying to learn how to be a better person than to stick with oppressive and hateful views that will stunt your growth to learn as a person!"
3408,2020-06-30 01:42:48,hiczzq,"NTA at all. Sounds like you grew up in a weird cult like family. Everything was somewhat fine until I read “they celebrate Hitlers birthday” and just,,,, someone needs to get their Christian card revoked. I wouldn’t feel bad for not going at all. They sound homophobic and extremely racist and just overall just jerks to you. Good for you for getting out of there and going to college."
3409,2020-06-30 01:18:43,hiczzq,Okay that kinda made me cry. I didn’t realize how much I needed to hear that. I always hear how I’m the problem and jeez... I really needed to hear that ❤️
3410,2020-06-30 01:05:19,hiczzq,Thank you so much! You don’t think I’m an asshole for not being a support figure to the kids?
3411,2020-06-30 01:20:49,hiczzq,"I appreciate this thank you! It did feel like I was abandoning them but I needed to hear that’s Basically don’t be vocal until they are starting to ask the right questions, yeah? That’s a really good advice"
3412,2020-06-30 01:33:29,hiczzq,"Thank you for the encouragement! I am sorry to hear you have a similar experience. 

I left a lot of details out but I 100% agree with you, they are not Christians. I believe people like my family use religion to buffer/disguise their reprehensible behavior. About 8 years ago something happened in the Church a grew up in (I was living out of state so I never learned the details) but after 25 years my parents stopped going to that church. I always had the feeling they were called out on their behavior and ofc they were “victimized”.  

Asking questions about religion and the Bible was the start of me doubting their faith. 

I think growing up in a small house, homeschooled until I left for college made us really close. You kinda had to be, in one sense haha 

Thank you for your kind words. I didn’t realize how much I needed to hear these things and this has been a lot more emotionally healing then I thought this would be. ❤️"

3414,2020-06-30 01:39:24,hiczzq,Yup...if you can't beat them... bide your time and wait them out. That's almost how that saying goes. Lol
3415,2020-06-30 01:53:11,hiczzq,"Absolutely, you need to hear these words and to know that I’m extremely proud of you because I know you’re going through a hard time now, but you need to know that standing up for yourself and to not succumb to your family’s beliefs isn’t easy but it’s definitely not weak at all! 

You did what your parents never had the strength to do: you admit that your old beliefs were wrong, which I know would have been a strike to your ego and I can imagine probably have hurt so much in the process, and strive to be better! The ability to admit that you could be wrong and to have an open mind is so much stronger than to stay close-minded and pretend to be the “victim.” And you did just that! 

And that’s okay, I didn’t get to chose my family and neither did you. The only thing I can say is that I’m so sorry that your family wasn’t capable enough of trying to change for the better, even if it mean your relationship would have been fractured. I know that I had a lot of pushback at first, but when I threatened that I would break things out if they didn’t hear me out, they were insightful enough to hear me out and we can work things out; and I’m so sorry your family didn’t end up doing the same for you no matter how hard you tried, it honestly breaks my heart that when families are too prideful to admit that their ego isn’t worth more than to have a relationship with their own child. 

The only thing that I have to say now is that I just hope that things work out between you and your siblings, your parents may be too far gone, but I hope your siblings will turn around and realize that you’re not wrong for questioning your family’s abuse and refusing to play their games any longer."
3416,2020-06-30 01:17:27,hiczzq,Oh now that is a really good point. In a sense I would prove their parents “right” if I was more outspoken. I really appreciate this. Thank you!
3417,2020-06-30 00:28:53,hice4q,"Am I wrong to think thats a whole lot of effort for playing a game in front of 0 fans?

3418,2020-06-30 01:22:50,hice4q,"Jesus. And the ""season"" hasn't even started yet. Hate to say it, but this is going to be a circus. So when the season starts, how do you handle teams like Arizona, Tampa Bay, Miami  and San Diego where things are a shit show right now. Travel restrictions are already in place if you fly out of those states and into different states."
3419,2020-06-30 01:09:35,hice4q,Canada is safer than the US right now so this is the best option for the Jays.
3420,2020-06-30 00:31:46,hice4q,"It’s arguable that based on the constant decrease in new daily cases in Canada (and specifically Ontario), a small amount of fans could eventually find their way to the dome. 

Beyond that, it would just be overall safer to play in Canada due to these lowering amount of cases than Florida where there’s been a huge outbreak once again."
3421,2020-06-30 03:57:44,hice4q,"That’s how I feel. Man I miss baseball so much but there is going to be so much attention away from the games. No or limited fans is just going to be odd to watch. And no matter what happens this season will have a bigger asterisk than 2017. 

I’d just rather wait for things to go back to normal."
3422,2020-06-30 03:06:30,hice4q,Not sure why you’re being downvoted. Given the current handling of Covid / political issues in the States I can’t see how someone would argue playing in Dunedin as being a better option.
3423,2020-06-30 05:28:56,hice4q,"It's a logistics problem - Canada is mostly off limits to US travelers, and those who are let in must quarantine for 14 days. That won't work with baseball's schedule."

3427,2020-06-30 01:05:20,hibosd,"You said the magic phrase 'Virtue Signaling' ding ding ding. Great job, OP."
3428,2020-06-30 03:08:51,hibosd,"This is actually a good, well written post about what happened at the time and why he wasn't signed. There were several factors involved that everyone seems to forget, and the kneeling WAS NOT the only reason he hasn't been in the league since. Depending on who you ask, the kneeling was essentially the icing on the cake. But that doesn't matter, it involved race so because race is mentioned anywhere that's it, it becomes the only reason. You had the mainstream media, and several people who didn't know anything about football, the NFL, or really Kaps skill level/ or game at the time reporting on this and making it far worse than it was. Any team signing him now would definitely be  'virtue signaling' , however, I do believe there is a case that he is better than some of the backups in the league right now. Hell if the Pats can sign Cam Newton for 1 mil with up to 7.5 in incentives, I don't think money would be an issue at this point.

One thing I think is worth mentioning though, is that after everything happened , he also sued the entire league for collusion against him. The NFL is a business so I'm not sure why as a business, if essentially what is an employee sues you and you settle out of court, why you would just turn around and re-hire that employee."
3429,2020-06-29 23:42:26,hibosd,"Oh, I thought he was a football player."
3430,2020-06-30 00:19:48,hibosd,"Lot of bullshit here 

>it was the same thing that happened with Tebow an

Tebow got phased out because he was legit an awful QB with no upside. Awful throwing motion, no power, iffy accuracy. There was not a single positive to his game.

>Vick

Vick just got old. He lost 2 years of his prime and didn't come back until he was 30.

>later on Newton

Cam didn't get figured out. His coaches and playstyle brought a ton of injuries he was giving himself the proper time to fully heal from. 

>soon Lamar Jackson,

The unanimous with a ton of talent around him?

>This happened the next season in the NFC title game where Seattle’s back field exposed him, if you force Kaepernick to stay in the pocket

Seattle didn't force him to stay in the pocket. He rushed for 130 yards. 

>In game 8 of the 2015 season he was benched for Blaine Gabbert against the Falcons. I happened to be at this game, just because I was in town and not on official business, and watched as Gabbert got injured and go out in the middle of a drive, Kaepernick take the field to a chorus of raucous boos, throw and interception and then a near pick before being booed off of the field never to return again for the remainder of the game

He was playing on a bum shoulder he got a few weeks before that ultimately ended his season once the team put him on IR.

>Kaepernick needed a new home as a starter and wouldn’t settle for anything less. 

That was never confirmed

>1. Locker Room Cancer 

His teammates literally voted and gave him a team award.

>3. Money - Kaepernick was asking for top tier pay when he simply wasn’t performing as a top tier level.

Again, never confirmed."
3431,2020-06-30 00:03:36,hibosd,He’s better than all of the backups and a few starters. He should have a job.

3436,2020-06-30 00:54:42,hibosd,">1. Tebow and Kaepernick draw a lot of parallels in my opinion, the main one being that no coaches wanted to work with them for one reason; kneeling.

Nobody wanted to work with Tebow because he was garbage. 

>2. Cam Newton was an MVP player until Dan Quinn highlighted what a lot of us suspected in the last game of the 2015 regular season and Von Miller cemented in the Super Bowl; rattle his cage and he gets shook.

This doesn't change the fact that he's had constant injuries and surgeries since then. 

>3. Vick was dynamic, then average, then an inmate. He should have been a wide receiver the trouble is that he had a cannon.

Then he came back as an MVP candidate, suffered a couple injuries and got old. 

>4. I think Jackson may have 2 or 3 more good years of he's lucky.

Thank you for letting me know your opinion means nothing. 

>5. You can't completely contain Kaepernick, the guys a runner in a position that isn't known for it's runners.

They literally didn't contain him at all. He ran all over the best defense in the league. 

>6. I promise you that if the injury were that bad they wouldn't have out their $20 million a year guy. 

What does this even mean?

>7. I'm confirming it.

Like that's worth anything

>8. You mean the award he received the year he started kneeling? Are you that ignorant or are you just buying into your own bullshit?

Why are you focused on the year? You can't be a locker room cancer if your teammates vote and give you a fucking award.

Too bad this doesn't mean anything."

Tebow was a part of a team that went to the 2nd round. Denver's offense that year was awful mostly because of how bad of a passer Tebow was."

They were outscored by 81 points on the season. They only scored on 25% of their offensive drives. They were almost dead last in 3rd down conversion rate and redzone conversion rate. They got out scored by 40+ points in their last 3 regular season games and only made the playoffs because of how incompetent the Raiders were. Out of 35 qualifying QBs, Tebow ranked dead last in passing ypg, 28th in passing TDs, 28th in passer rating, and last in completion percentage. He was awful."

3449,2020-06-30 14:24:47,hibosd,">Maybe, maybe not. But at least he left with a winning record.

No it's pretty definitive. In a league that's desperate for QBs he could only manage a full seasons worth of starts through 3 years. Even that's skewed because of his NYJ tenure where he technically started 2 games but only threw 8 total passes and played only 7% of their offensive snaps. Yikes. 

 

>Your boy Kaepernick couldn't hang and then blamed it on his ""social justice"" stance when he got bumped. He got his fat contract then went 8-8 and couldn't win again after, if he gets back into the league it won't be because he deserves it but because the NFL doesn't want to take the PR hit

He easily deserves at the very least a backup position. Especially when players like Matt Barkley, Brian Hoyer, Mike Glennon, Chase Daniel, and Nathan Peterman all have jobs"

3566,2020-06-29 20:31:52,hi7m7b,Jeremiah has Lance as his #1 QB
3567,2020-06-29 21:50:17,hi7m7b,Okay anybody saying that Lawrence basically doesn't have any weaknesses is full of shit.
3568,2020-06-29 21:08:43,hi7m7b,"I’ve watched every snap Lance has taken, and I did it all last season before anyone bothered to talk about him. All due respect, the evaluation posted here is so bloated with hyperbole it’s hard to take it seriously. He was 19 years old, starting his first season at the FCS level. Suggesting he’s immediately among the most athletic QBs in the NFL seems far-fetched, not because it is or isn’t true, but the lack of significant tape supporting it. And “this guy absolutely will not make a mistake?” C’mon...he made plenty of them. He was a redshirt freshman. 

I’m a big fan of his, and I knew the hype would elevate him sooner rather than later, but if you don’t watch FCS play often, you slip into the trap of putting him at the same level as high end FBS guys. I feel he’d have success at a major school too, but he’s not playing against elite defensive athletes, so acting as if he’s not making mistakes because he didn’t throw an interception (I saw a few that should have been) is suspect. Best Ds he faced were James Madison and Ill St. JMU didn’t give him much in the air, and he whipped them once and they locked him down once. 

The difference between a mid-level FCS school and NDSU is shocking. 

He only threw 287 passes, many against defenses any QB getting NFL pub would torch. He’s more of a power runner than a burner, and they ran him inside plenty often. 

He’s a great prospect who doesn’t belong at the level he’s at. But he’s still very young. It seems to me more people are rushing to over-praise him to get in on the ground floor bandwagon they weren’t on when Wentz went from nobody at NDSU to second overall pick and a nice early NFL career. 

They’re gonna open up a lot more for him this year and they won’t be as young as they were at the skills. Now that he put down some tape, we’ll see how teams defend him and their offense. He’s gonna have a tougher year but will still be the best player at that level."

3578,2020-06-29 21:26:41,hi7m7b,The simple fan thinks interceptions are the only indicator of good and bad. That’s why they think Lance is God
3579,2020-06-30 14:17:59,hi7m7b,"Yeah, I just don't understand how anyone can look at what Lance did this year and not have a wait and see attitude about him. He averaged like 17 passes a game and didn't put up gaudy numbers outside of 0 picks. NDSU clearly didn't put a lot on his plate this year or ask him to really do anything difficult. And this was against FCS level competition. 

With that being said he was certainly good enough to not just dismiss like most FCS QBs would be, but as right now he can't be viewed as the same level of prospect as LAwrnece and Fields to me. He's on the right path but he's got more to prove."
3580,2020-06-29 20:14:33,hi7m7b,He is 2022 Draft. I got him QB1 in front of Slovis

3584,2020-06-30 05:11:15,hi7m7b,Lmao this is a comical comment indeed
3585,2020-06-29 20:46:38,hi7m7b,Oh shit is Lawrence gonna slide mysteriously into the 20s and get drafted by a team with an aging elite QB and then continue dominating the league for years?
3586,2020-06-30 00:11:01,hi7m7b,"Bruh Lance is the real deal while Lawrence wasn’t that good last year. Wouldn’t blame anyone for having Lance ahead of Lawrence, nor would I blame anyone for the reverse."
3587,2020-06-30 03:17:53,hi7m7b,So juicy...
3588,2020-06-29 22:37:46,hi7m7b,"First of all, as a rule, anybody that says a QB basically has no weaknesses are full of it. Second, Lawrence is not the most accurate QB. His accuracy really is only consistent on one type of pass: the back shoulder fade to his left. He also gets tricked way too often by presnap defenses which leads to terrible turnovers."
3589,2020-06-29 21:48:32,hi7m7b,"He’s a good player, and no one is a bigger fan of his than I am, but Kiper mentioned him once and every paid analyst one-upped the last one in terms of his status, and the amateur evaluators can’t find enough superlatives to describe him. 

If Trevor Lawrence had Lance’s championship game performance, he’d have been dragged all over everywhere."
3590,2020-06-29 20:15:54,hi7m7b,"Fair enough. Pardon my ignorance, I thought he was this year. My bad"

3592,2020-06-30 02:51:59,hi7m7b,I have Slovis as the top guy but 2022 is shaping up to be a really good class as well
3593,2020-06-29 21:56:33,hi7m7b,Don't worry. By this time next year he will claim he never said that. Just like you can't find anyone on Reddit that will admit to saying Fields is a terrible QB that will look terrible trying to pass the ball at OSU. And that UGA was better off because he can't play QB as well as Fromm.

3596,2020-06-30 05:20:31,hi7m7b,Have you ever watched even a single game of Purdy’s? He’s by far the better NFL prospect.

3599,2020-06-29 21:12:40,hi7m7b,"Which shows how much potential he has. I was looking forward to going to the UCF season opener against him and UNC, but I feel my ticket may be an expensive piece of scrap paper right now..."

That’s blatantly obvious. Not to mention some fan calling him the n-word during a game but that’s irrelevant to him leaving. Had nothing to do with the system, the only person making that claim, with zero proof, is you. Funny the only person in this thread shit talking fields is a UGA fan.  What a coincidence. Lmao"

And no I’m not, there were several reports he couldn’t grasp our pro style system. Fromm is a douche but he had a high football IQ and was accurate and made hood decisions and could read defenses pre and post snap, we failed to surround him with talent these last two years."
3624,2020-06-30 05:31:47,hi7m7b,"We run a pro system. Fields didn’t know what cover 2 was as a senior in high school. Fields never stood a shot here, he’s not an x o guy and that’s why he’ll fail in the NFL too."

3633,2020-06-29 22:23:08,hi7m7b,"Right right. Just like Fields is too slow to pick OSU offense and given that he would be in the program only a few months, disaster wanting to happen. If only Fromm high IQ and accuracy could have saved UGA the last two seasons. 

Maybe Fromm should run a more simple offense. It would help him to not look like trash in college. 

He won't find success in the NFL. Sounds like the same nonsense that was said about Fields when he transferred to OSU."

3637,2020-06-29 22:24:21,hi7m7b,"Bro OSU notoriously has one of the most simple offenses in college football. Why do you think they all bomb so hard in the NFL? He’s also going to have to learn the position from a mental standpoint. He’s not reading defenses he’s just throwing to open guys.

Go read Burrow’s comments on the difference between offenses at OSU and LSU."
3638,2020-06-29 22:53:12,hi7m7b,"OSU runs an offense that is predicated on creating athletic mismatches in open space, or more commonly known as a collegiate style offense. Basically we think our guy is more athletic then your guy and if you don’t think so, stop us.

That’s a wonderful strategy for college football, but for reasons too numerous to name, it doesn’t work in the NFL. Pro style offenses focus far more on knowing what the defenses are doing, knowing what your guys are doing, and throwing the ball to specific spot on the field knowing your guy is going to be there.

Day, and Meyer before him have always run collegiate style. That’s why his QB’s are always awful when they get up to the NFL. They don’t know route trees, they don’t know how to diagnose defenses, and they don’t know how to anticipate routes and throw to a spot."
3639,2020-06-29 20:56:53,hi7m7b,"Lance isn’t better than Lawerence. Lawerence is the best QB prospect since Elway. Lance is good, franchise QB potential for sure, but man a team would have to be dumb to take him over Lawerence. Classic case of overthinking it and not just watching the two guys play."
3640,2020-06-30 05:39:02,hi7m7b,Yeah the difference is they have skills and play in pro style systems that Fields does not.
3641,2020-06-29 22:40:31,hi7m7b,"You know that Meyer isn’t the head coach at OSU anymore right? You also know that Day runs a different system then Meyer did right? So if you’re going to judge QB’s by Day’s system you would only have Haskins to go off of (only one year in Day’s system) and it’s far too early to make an assessment on him. Even if he doesn’t on out, one data point does not a trend make. 

Or do you think that the offensive system at a college is put in place by the administration and the coaches just read it off to the players?"
3642,2020-06-29 22:54:03,hi7m7b,"What? You mean Meyer's offense? I mean it produced Alex Smith. And no QB other QB besides Tebow was drafted in the first round. 

But that is not even the point because Meyers is not even there. It is Ryan Day offense who was QB coach at the 49ers and Eagles prior to OSU in 2017. 

He produced Haskins. Haskins has played in like 5 NFL games and is headed into year 2. 

Please stop. 

And Jesus Christ. BURROWS NEVER PLAYED IN FIELDS OFFENSE AT OSU as that was primarily Meyers offense when Burrow was at OSU. 

And Burrows isn't an authority on shit. It is yet to be seen if his OC at LSU was the one doing all the work."
3643,2020-06-29 23:17:38,hi7m7b,"Ah so no sources. Just more of you acting like you know what your talking about. Every offense schemes mismatches. That’s literally the goal. But implying that Day’s scheme is entirely based on “my guys more athletic” without concern for the defensive set or throwing to anticipated spots is just ignorant. 

Let me know when you find those sources"
3644,2020-06-29 23:40:45,hi7m7b,"Alex Smith?

You know Ryan Day got hired from the NFL right? He was the 9ers OC I think, so I would wager that his offense while not traditional prostyle is still a good approximation."
3645,2020-06-30 05:47:07,hi7m7b,"Yea I’m sure every successful QB in the history of the NFL played in a purely pro style offense LMAO 

You don’t know jack about Ohio States offense under Ryan Day, under Day they line up under center, use play action, use two TE sets. They don’t just line up in Shotgun and run spread all game like Meyer did. Ryan Day worked on offenses in the NFL before coming to Ohio State for a reason. It’s so blatantly obvious that you are talking out your rear end because you are salty about Field leaving and having success while UGA got stuck with the less talented QB."
3646,2020-06-29 22:55:28,hi7m7b,Exactly.
3647,2020-06-30 05:15:38,hi7m7b,Thank you. I didn’t feel like wasting my time trying to explain this to this dude. I couldn’t have said it better myself.
3648,2020-06-29 22:43:40,hi7m7b,"Give me a fucking break Day’s been running the offense at OSU since Meyer’s “health scares”

They specifically asked Burrow the difference in Day’s and Brady’s offenses and he said I wouldn’t be (at the Heisman ceremony) here tonight."
3649,2020-06-29 22:59:09,hi7m7b,"I’m not repeating myself for a third time. Day and Meyer’s offense are the same pig with different makeup.

And lmfao bud Alex Smith absolutely sucked ass when he came into the NFL. The only reason he stuck around was because he was from an era where being first overall meant major major money."
3650,2020-06-29 23:19:14,hi7m7b,"I don’t need sources, I understand the system. If you’d like to refute that with anything, feel free.

And no, not every team does seek out athletic mismatches."
3651,2020-06-30 14:37:00,hi7m7b,"The OSU offense looked far more like a modern NFL offense than UGAs did in 2019. UGA runs a traditional ""pro style offense"" that was the norm in the NFL in the early 2000s. OSU runs a power spread that is becoming more and more prevalent in the NFL every year. Yes, OSU does focus on creating mismatches athletically (as does UGA, even though he somehow attempts to dispute that), but it's just objectively false to say QBs who come from a spread don't know route trees and can't diagnose a defense.

This guy just doesn't like Fields because he left UGA and was far more successful than Fromm."

Also Day was hired in 2017 so even if what you say is correct (it’s not) that’s still only *3 years* of data to your “OSU QBs always bomb in the nfl” hypothesis."
3654,2020-06-29 23:04:25,hi7m7b,Fromm is an elist racist and sucked ass at UGA.

This is really coming off like the jealous ex boyfriend tbh"
3656,2020-06-30 06:11:04,hi7m7b,"A “pro style” offense is an offense that can use several different formations at anytime. Shotgun, 2 TE sets, I formation, 11 personnel. Colleges that don’t run a pro style offense usually stick to 1 or 2 formations and run all their plays from that. Ohio State uses several different formations. They have a lot of pro style aspects to their offense since Day took over

How complex the reads are is not what makes it a “pro style” offense. Thanks for proving you have no idea what you are actually talking about though."
3657,2020-06-29 22:54:27,hi7m7b,"Were there minor differences? Sure, make it a little sexier, dress it up, but he’s still playing collegiate style create mismatches in open spaces. Same pig different lipstick."

3691,2020-06-30 01:28:11,hi76cx,Bron fans have been downplaying his teammates for years.  You haven't been paying attention if you haven't seen it.
3692,2020-06-29 23:24:41,hi76cx,Yep
3693,2020-06-30 00:06:03,hi6zng,Ricardo Sanchez was waived this offseason
3694,2020-07-01 00:44:10,hi6zng,"The only guy on your list I'm kinda meh about is Austin Nola.  He's a nice role player but I don't think he hits same handed pitching well enough to move the needle outside of the small platoon and isn't a very advanced catcher.  He's a nice addition to the vs. LHP lineup and they can put him at 1B if White needs a day off, or 2B/3B although I think they have better subs there in Gordon, Moore, and Lopes.  Anyway, he's cool but I think I'd go with one of Lopes, Brennan, Fraley, or Moore over him."
3695,2020-06-30 19:03:05,hi6zng,"Ah, I did make a small error. And it's fixed now."
3696,2020-06-30 19:05:38,hi6zng,"Who do u like instead?  Without thinking about it too much I say Austin Adams, but since we're talking down the road it's a tough exercise that I dont have the mental energy to spare for atm."
3697,2020-06-30 20:22:45,hi6zng,"That's fine, and this is just for a 2021 scenario and potentially a realistic fiction book."
3698,2020-08-20 15:46:17,idchsr,That tyrell terry news is interesting
3699,2020-08-20 15:45:26,idchsr,"Tyrell Terry being over 6’3 is absolutely wild. What’s everyone’s top 3 big board for the Knicks looking like??? I like Lamelo, Deni, and Halliburton a lot."
3700,2020-08-20 15:54:57,idchsr,"None of this really matters. The only possible outcome is San Antonio drafting an All-NBA superstar at 11th and a couple years later everyone relentlessly mocks the Knicks for missing on whoever that's going to be.

It is known."
3701,2020-08-20 15:35:08,idchsr,"Sorry for the right formatting, I'm on mobile"
3702,2020-08-20 16:57:34,idchsr,Tyrell Terry is 6'3'' now?! Let's fucking go I want this kid haha
3703,2020-08-20 17:20:06,idchsr,"Had a feeling Deni would solidify himself top 5 after the Israeli league ended.

I'm intrigued about Terry growing in size wonder how high he would go.

RJ and Kira potentially falling excites me as either could be trade up candidates or just fall to us"
3704,2020-08-20 18:03:15,idchsr,I've been the only one bringing up Patrick Williams name on here.  Really like the kid and think he's a great fit.  If we could maneuver a trade down a few spots to pick up another asset and him I would be pleased.
3705,2020-08-20 19:59:30,idchsr,I remember Wiseman being considered #1. You are telling me that he might drop at the late lottery? What? How is this possible?
3706,2020-08-20 20:18:47,idchsr,Thank you Wasserman for validating my thoughts on Anthony Edwards
3707,2020-08-20 21:35:36,idchsr,"If wiseman drops to like 7, I wouldn’t mind taking him there because it would be a great value for our pick plus we have a good amount of PG options at 27."
3708,2020-08-20 23:57:59,idchsr,I want Tyrell Terry
3709,2020-08-20 16:03:10,idchsr,I see him posting about alot of players moving out of the lottery.  So who's moving up?
3710,2020-08-20 17:38:45,idchsr,"To me Deni is a project and one worth taking for the right team .

The knicks aren’t the right team , if the knicks draft someone it’s best they can play right now even if it means a lower ceiling down the line ."
3711,2020-08-20 16:05:06,idchsr,"Deni is fools gold. Teams are gonna go for broke on international prospects after Luka and kp. 

The Edwards thing is interesting because idk where the low iq stuff is coming from, he seemed to talk about game tape pretty well in his ESPN interview. 

Agree on okoro, don't know what his NBA level skill is. 

Honestly, this just makes lamelo the #1 pick."
3712,2020-08-20 15:52:06,idchsr,"Honestly. If we drop to 10, I'd consider trading down with the Celtics if possible and grabbing him at 14. He's too good"
3713,2020-08-20 15:51:31,idchsr,"My big 3 is LaMelo, Deni, and Edwards but I have big question marks about Edwards and he may end up dropping out of my top 3"
3714,2020-08-20 22:02:37,idchsr,I have the same exact top 3 and wouldn’t be mad if we took Deni over Ball.
3715,2020-08-20 17:36:08,idchsr,"But did Terry fill out a bit 
Being 6’3 165 isn’t much different than 6’2 165 

It’s very rare for a player get drafted in the 1st round and be under 175lbs"
3716,2020-08-20 16:28:39,idchsr,Patrick Williams and Jalen Smith shot up and are considered Lottery picks with Tyrell Terry being considered that high as well
3717,2020-08-20 16:52:47,idchsr,Teams are paying a lot of money for their scouters and GM to evaluate draft prospects. If some of them (and not just 1) rank him high they have a good reason for that. Trust me they tested him and watched him more than anybody else in this sub.
3718,2020-08-20 15:54:19,idchsr,If he’s taller For real Idk if he’ll be there at 14. Not a lot of pgs in this draft can shoot and that kid is a sniper
3719,2020-08-20 15:53:40,idchsr,I feel like the article hit it perfectly about Edwards. He has a great NBA body but there’s something about his motor I question.
3720,2020-08-20 16:46:36,idchsr,"I always had Edwards Deni and LaMelo in that order on my board, but this article nailed it about Edwards and honestly all these 3 worth a real consideration as a #1 pick. Edwards is not a consensus #1 on my board anymore."
3721,2020-08-20 17:43:16,idchsr,I'm not worried about him being 165 as long as he has the frame to put on muscle.
3722,2020-08-20 16:31:09,idchsr,It just seems like hes saying late lotto for alot of guys..  How many can be picked 10-14 lol
3723,2020-08-21 00:05:30,idchsr,"Edwards is a late bloomer.

Lots of volatility.

A case study in development.

Still number 1."
3724,2020-08-20 18:21:49,idchsr,"If he is actually taller I would take him at 10 in this draft no doubt, maybe at 8 depending on who is left"
3725,2020-08-20 17:44:15,idchsr,They're projections so he's estimating their value
3726,2020-08-20 15:46:37,idch54,Nibba did a video with Will Smith can we discuss that?
3727,2020-08-20 20:34:37,idch54,360 camera on a pole-ball type setup - there's a patch of grass that looks content-aware filled when it's furthest away
3728,2020-08-20 15:34:48,idch54,"Global camera, pulled the parts where he stayed visible"
3729,2020-08-20 18:12:11,idch54,Boomerang with a 360 camera.
3730,2020-08-20 17:32:49,idch54,Drone + Fake Shadow
3731,2020-08-21 06:28:38,idch54,How the heck did you get to do a video with Will Smith? Are you boys with him?
3732,2020-08-20 19:23:11,idch54,No one has guessed it right yet! I’ll give you the answer tonight
3733,2020-08-20 15:50:52,idch54,Boomerang shadow at the end. Not sure about the camera set up
3734,2020-08-20 23:20:00,idch54,Gopro attached to Jaden's head as even his dad finds him too annoying and has to launch him from the house sometimes
3735,2020-08-20 20:42:11,idch54,Wow! Right on the button. Good eye
3736,2020-08-20 15:58:42,idch54,I think the boomerang shadow is fake...
3737,2020-08-20 15:59:47,idch54,What other object you know that you throw and it comes back to you?
3738,2020-08-20 16:00:58,idch54,A drone
3739,2020-08-20 16:04:25,idch54,So you think he photoshopped a boomerang just to hide the drone?
3740,2020-08-20 16:14:21,idch54,This is the aftereffects subreddit... Imagine having  a camera with a gimble oon a boomerang... It kinda ruins the areodynamics of it. Also catching a solid boomerang out of the air with your bare hands is a good way to break some fingers... if it was a foam boomerang it would just fall out of air... It also could be as simple as a poll with a string that they edited out kinda like tetherball... Hopefully he doesnt just ask the question and gives us an answer... But if its a solid boomerang with a camera and gimble on it then you sir are a good guesser
3741,2020-08-20 16:28:28,idch54,You know what you’re right valid point.
3742,2020-08-20 15:44:37,idch48,"The 80 gallons will give you more of a buffer. You take a shower and use 20 gal, now you have 60 gallons of hot and 20 gal of cold in the tank.in one hour the tank will be back up to temp. If you were to use 60 gallons it would take 3 hours to get back to temp...you should look into a tankless, they are so much more efficient and take up much less space

Edit:noticed you have an electric wh. Tankless might not be an option depending on if you have gas and room for exhaust venting"
3743,2020-08-20 15:44:39,idch48,"No offense but how many women in the house?

We purchase an AO Smith 40 gallon tank and we have no problems with hot water, couldn't even tell you recovery time. Between my 4yo taking 20 minute hot showers and my wife and I taking longer showers it's been fine. Hot baths as well.

Since the 80 gallon is older, the 50 gallon probably has the same efficiency. Did you ever have a problem with the 80gallon not giving enough hot water?

Also, the average dishwasher uses only 6 gallons. Coupled that with the fact that hot water should only be used on towels and sheets, I think the 50 gallon would be fine."
3744,2020-08-20 15:45:34,idch48,"So wife and I have a 65 gal heat pump and she takes baths.

80 gal heat pump is probably fine for you. We haven't noticed an issue with recovery with bath + dishwasher then shower.

It will depend on where you live how quickly it recovers - summer months in a hot garage it will go quickly. Cold winter slowly, but you can always switch to the inefficient heat if you need to generate more heat in a hurry.

Food for thought, but you should be fine. A HPWH has all of the functionality of a traditional water heater plus an AC unit on top for efficiency if it isn't reheating fast enough."
3745,2020-08-20 16:22:34,idch48,"I've had a 50 gal for years with 3 baths, 5 people and dishwasher, very seldom had a problem with running out of hot water. Kids are out and now replaced with 40 gal gas WH. We did have low flow shower heads."
3746,2020-08-21 03:26:04,idch48,There is no way 50 gal is recommended for four people?  Kids get older and take longer showers.  Don't plan for failure.
3747,2020-08-20 16:38:22,idch48,"My current one is Gas. I am getting the 50 Gal for a total cost of only $320 (original $1,200) due to a bunch of discounts. The 80 gallon will cost me $1k (originally $1,899). 

I'm not too pressed on cost, and would consider tankless if it weren't for the cost these were bought for. 

&#x200B;

I like your breakdown. But will a shower really tax the system for 20 gallons? I genuinely don't know so I am asking.   


As a side note, my master bath is being remodeled this year and I was considering adding an inline tankless heater at the shower."
3748,2020-08-21 03:52:05,idch48,"So as an update. The tank actually has a first hour delivery of 66 gallons. Lowe's website says 20. It's insane, but the manufacturer is the listening I'm listening to. Knowing that, how does this seem to perform with that turn around?"
3749,2020-08-20 16:42:29,idch48,"I'm not in a hot Climate, and mine will be located in the basement next to the HVAC unit. Basement is around 1k sq ft, and finished. In the winter it will get hot from heating, and it's usually cool or colder in the basement where the HP won't benefit from much."
3750,2020-08-20 16:43:05,idch48,Good info. How often do you have people shower at the same time or back to back?
3751,2020-08-21 03:54:36,idch48,That's what I'm trying to avoid. But now I have news that I read the Lowe's site for the gallons per hour recovery. Updated my OP.
3752,2020-08-20 16:42:59,idch48,"Wow, good price...most shower heads are 2.5gpm(any made and sold in the us after 1992ish are supposed to be anyway). So figure about 1 gal of hot used per minute in the shower. (Little more in the winter/less in summer)"
3753,2020-08-21 04:25:44,idch48,Recovery rate is 20. 66 is how many gallons you can use when it’s at temp before you completely run out of hot water.
3754,2020-08-21 12:20:29,idch48,"I would say it sounds nice, but you may not see the true return - but they are great at dehumidifying. You would need a place to drain the condensate. If money isn't an object get it, and you can run it is the moderately efficient hybrid mode."
3755,2020-08-20 18:22:14,idch48,"Everyone mostly showered in the morning, but spread out from 6 to 8."
3756,2020-08-20 16:44:21,idch48,I'm gonna have to just ask my wife to map her usage throughout the day. The only thing I don't want to hear is how she hates what I changed haha
3757,2020-08-21 04:52:11,idch48,"Shoot. I'm not gonna gamble, but might keep this and add an electrician tankless for the master bathroom. Or I can shut up and just get the 80 and don't complicate things."
3758,2020-08-20 15:12:26,idc2nl,"This is what “defunding” the police is about. If this man and his family had gotten the non-police help they needed long ago, we would not have three officers shot, a mentally ill man in jail for life, and a traumatized family. The consequences will ripple through this family, not to mention the wounded officers, for decades. Prevention is so much cheaper, and better for everyone, including YOU, whoever you are. How can anyone who supports police oppose making their jobs less dangerous?"
3759,2020-08-20 16:40:06,idc2nl,">“Mr. Taylor’s mother had gone to the police really seeking help, mental health treatment, for her son, but what she described was a criminal offense,” Dick said.

*But*? That should be an *and*. He needed mental health treatment *and* committed a crime. Committing a crime does not negate the fact that someone needs mental health treatment. In fact, it only makes the treatment *more* urgent. The very way they talk about it is already the wrong attitude."
3760,2020-08-20 23:42:31,idc2nl,Should have been institutionalized for the first crime.  Now three people are shot.

These people had the best care money can buy (okay, maybe not the $50K a day rock star resorts) and still had problems. I can't imagine what it is like for someone without insurance or a solid support structure around them."
3763,2020-08-20 15:38:55,idc2nl,"Exactly what I was going to say. I have a friend who's 16 year old has serious mental health issues. She has begged and pleaded for help, and there is just none available. He will be in care for 3 days or so whenever he gets violent enough to call the police, but any other help just doesn't exist."
3764,2020-08-20 16:26:39,idc2nl,"The penal system is the biggest provider of mental healthcare in the US. That isn’t the fault of the police. Mental health was dumped into their lap after the closing of state hospitals across the country.

While community care for mental health works for some, it in no way, shape, or form works for all. The defunding of mental hospitals and deinstitutionalization of patients created a critical shortage. There is a critical gap in the number of long term bed spaces for those with mental illness. Patients who need structured inpatient care cannot get it. Hospitals do not have bed space to care longer than 72hrs at MOST. As a result police are confronted with these individuals more and more often because the system puts them back on the streets. Because of this broken system there are only two options for people who require structured inpatient care. A) they don’t get it and roam among society. Or B) they get the treatment after they commit a crime and are part of the penal system. There is no middle ground option anymore.   

They may not be perfect in handling it, but Law enforcement didn’t create the problem. They were forced into this position starting in the 60’s and 70’s.  There are many arguments for defunding police but blaming them for the current mental health crisis in America is not one."
3765,2020-08-20 15:40:36,idc2nl,"You have too much faith in our mental health services and capabilities.

It is a monumental feat to forcibly commit somebody and enforce treatment.   

People shit on Reagan for defunding mental health and causing the mental health crisis we have now, but in reality its our societal aversion to abridging the rights of chronically mentally ill persons.   We don't tolerate indefinite commitment/confinement of people who cannot (for whatever reason) stay in treatment."
3766,2020-08-20 15:29:21,idc2nl,"Long term mental health care is still going to be lacking in Austin and Texas in general, but yea who knows if it would have made a difference, he apparently was already getting mental health assistance"
3767,2020-08-20 18:10:57,idc2nl,Danger is inherent to fighting violence and crime. I apologize you can’t connect those dots
3768,2020-08-20 15:33:01,idc2nl,"So if they had sent out social workers instead of cops, there would most likely be upcoming funerals. Behind bars is where he belongs. It’s not the responsibility of the government to make sure people get mental help, the family should have done more to make sure he was especially knowing what he was capable of"
3769,2020-08-20 17:45:21,idc2nl,This attitude is probably why the police are so bad at actually *preventing* crime.
3770,2020-08-20 16:06:56,idc2nl,Cedar park hasn't done any dedunding as far as I know so I dont think anyone is making that argument. Also he was already apparently getting mental health assistance in Houston and refused to take his meds. Its hard to help some one that doesn't accept it

They do have information on reasorces available if they are not apropriate.  Also if they are on reddit there are alot of good mentall health support subs, full of supportive people who may have more personal experience figuring out how to get services.
I wish them the best of luck."
3772,2020-08-20 21:29:40,idc2nl,"Fault, blame, all of that doesn't matter - it's about recognizing where tax dollars would have the best overall outcome. So it's not the fault of the police, but we don't have to keep making the same mistakes and thinking it makes society better."

3780,2020-08-20 15:56:32,idc2nl,The first step is funding! Diverting SOME funds from police toward mental health and other services will be cheaper in the long run and will keep officers safer!
3781,2020-08-20 19:17:32,idc2nl,they didn't imply that it's not. they just advocated preventative measures
3782,2020-08-20 15:53:39,idc2nl,"If they had funded and sent out social workers two years ago (or likely long before that), the police probably would not have been called in 2019 or 2020 and no shots would have been fired. The whole point of reimagining public safety is to think outside the box and seek long-term solutions."
3783,2020-08-20 17:56:02,idc2nl,They don't get paid to prevent crime. They get paid to go to court after it's happened.
3784,2020-08-20 16:12:06,idc2nl,I just remeber seeing a comment that said something along those lines and I'm sure it's an argument that many people use. Regardless of the specifics of the situation it is true that you cant make someone get help which is very true. buuuut it's also true that if you had a community centered more on taking care of people and putting resources where they are needed you can guarantee this becomes less of a problem period all across the board easy.
3785,2020-08-21 13:03:48,idc2nl,"I appreciate that, but it's not that simple. He needs intensive, inpatient care. Anything like that in the area (that takes insurance) has ridiculously long waits for a bed. They're on the wait list for all of them. Private facilities that don't take insurance cost about $8000 a month, which they just don't have. The entire system is just woefully inadequate"
3786,2020-08-20 15:59:49,idc2nl,"That's certainly true, but a large issue with many schizophrenic patients is their inability to stay on their treatment plans.   They get better and stop taking their drugs, then get worse and lose contact with reality so won't get back on their drugs."
3787,2020-08-20 19:12:31,idc2nl,"The path towards de-institutionalization was happening before he took over as governor in California (and other places in the US well before he became president).

It was a done deal that the old institutions and asylums of the past were disappearing, and we weren't going to force unwilling people into incarceration for mental illness by the time he became president."
3788,2020-08-20 18:44:34,idc2nl,And no one fixed in 40 years. Lots of crime bills got through in that time from both parties.
3789,2020-08-20 23:40:53,idc2nl,"No, deinstitutionalization was a project of the left."
3790,2020-08-20 16:01:36,idc2nl,Yea but for long term health and facilities it will take way more what they alreayd have cut maybe even more that apd could handle being diverted
3791,2020-08-20 15:58:37,idc2nl,Even under the new guidelines they put out that situation would still require a police response
3792,2020-08-20 16:05:24,idc2nl,"Again, why did the family not do more to get him help? Especially knowing he has violent tendencies towards his siblings. Why rely on the government and act surprised when they failed to do it? Quit playing the victim when you don’t do anything to help yourself and your family"
3793,2020-08-20 23:41:37,idc2nl,There's really no reason to believe that.
3794,2020-08-20 16:16:15,idc2nl,True I was just talking about this one specific circumstance
3795,2020-08-21 17:58:11,idc2nl,"Yeah it's a horrific situation to be in. It's never a simple solution.
My final desperation suggestions:

Family/group counseling in an attempt for the kids support net to have a support net/find resources/discuss options with those in a similiar situation.

State Hospitals

MAP/medicaid/ect(harass them and they'll get you some info if they can't help directly. Personal experience, they do not enjoy being hounded by a crying, manic, adult man, and will throw packets upon packets at you or sign you up just to get rid of you. They were very compasionate, just had hard limits on what they can and cannot do.)

Possibly eligible for some emergency coverage under ACA?(the 'obama' care thing. Not good with acronyms)

Religious charities/grants/treatment facilities(desperation)

Game the system by declaring him as homless?(potential legal risk; I had to go that route at one point, while couch surfing. Wasn't on any leases and they didn't ask a lot of questions.)

Super desteration:
Reach out to standup comics who are open about thier mental health journey.
They are broke, live in thier cars, and rarely have insurance, but some do find the help they need.
Doug Stanhope I know responds to his psych fans(his manager Greg Chaille usually handels emails, but Doug does get directly involved, and has 2 different guests currently in psych or in jail for psych issues as semi-regular call in guests on his podcast to bring attention to the issue and humanise people with mental health issues. His wife is Bipolar/Schizoaffective, has been in state mandated involuntary lock up in several states, and both very open about that journey)

I'll leave you alone from this point. 
I really wish y'all the best.
I'm sorry these are such last ditch, desperation suggestions.

Anyone else reading this: PLEASE vote for increased mental health care. You LITERALLY can save lives by doing that one simple thing.

Anybody in the struggle know this: Yes, it's a shity journey, but know you're never alone. Your fellow psych recipients look out for eachother. Our resources are limited, but our compassion and understanding are not.

Sorry for this novel. Manic AF, and one of my coping mechanisms is to try to be supportive of others in the struggle."
3796,2020-08-20 19:35:36,idc2nl,"A LOT of people being treated for mental health issues stop treatment because they find themselves in a position where they can no longer afford it.  Job/insurance loss, etc.  Financial accessibility is a fucking huge issue for all of healthcare in this country.  Mental health is no exception.  The only real difference is untreated mental illness can lead to violence, like it did here.

In general we wouldnt need nearly as many police if we properly invested in society.  But that's filthy commie talk and doesnt immediately give the Dow a boner."
3797,2020-08-20 20:15:17,idc2nl,That’s is all certainly true but that doesn’t change the fact that Reagan did nothing to fight for mental health from his position of power. Plenty of other actors and politics played a part in the process but he took no interest in educated himself on the issue. We can still shit on him for that. Also we can shit on Reagan for many other reasons but I digress.
3798,2020-08-20 18:56:27,idc2nl,That's right. Failure of our institutions and its executors.
3799,2020-08-20 23:53:36,idc2nl,WHAT
3800,2020-08-20 19:35:26,idc2nl,We could scrape some off the military budget. We can’t keep saying it cost too much.
3801,2020-08-21 18:13:39,idc2nl,"State Hospitals - they are all full and have waiting lists. They are on all the lists.

MAP/Medicaid/Etc - They have insurance.

Religious charities/grants/treatment facilities - They can't do much but offer emotional support. There is no organization that will provide the $8000 a month needed for the few private options with available beds.

Game the System - He basically is homeless now since he left. That doesn't change the fact that there are no in-treatment facilities available. He is only 16, so they looked into placing him in the foster care system to see if he could get in-patient services, but it won't make any difference. There are just no beds available. They were told if anything, it would just mean he's placed in a juvenile detention center, which isn't mental health care. 

They have been in all shades of counselling since he was very young - like 5 years old. But he needs more than just weekly therapy sessions."

Kennedy initiated the process 

&#x200B;

In 1967 <<The California Legislature passes the [Lanterman-Petris-Short Act](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=wic&group=04001-05000&file=5000-5120), which makes involuntary hospitalization of mentally ill people vastly more difficult. One year after the law goes into effect, the number of mentally ill people in the criminal-justice system [doubles](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/asylums/special/excerpt.html).>

<<The act was pushed forward with the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, to extend equal rights to those with mental health disabilities as well as chronic alcoholism. >>

<<Prior to 1967, California’s mental health system looked very different than it does now.  Many more individuals with mental health disabilities lived in state hospitals and large facilities, often for long periods of their life. Then California passed the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (Welfare and Institutions Code Sections 5000 et seq).  Named after its authors, State Assemblyman Frank Lanterman and California State Senators Nicholas C. Petris and Alan Short, the LPS Act sought to, “end the inappropriate, indefinite, and involuntary commitment of persons with mental health disorders.” It also established a right to prompt psychiatric evaluation and treatment, in some situations, and set out strict due process protections for mental health clients.>>"

3808,2020-08-21 20:59:56,idc2nl,"Thanks. I seriously needed that.

This is honestly a coping mechanism to assuage my own guilt in not being able to help my Dad in another state, plus getting out from under my own depression and feeling of worthlessness, and at least try to do something productive.

To anybody lurking, I got an Apointment with Lonestar Circle of care in under 5 minutes. As this conversation demonstrates, it's not appropriate for every situation, but is at least a starting point.

3810,2020-08-20 20:16:47,idc2nl,If you want to have nation wide long term mental health treatment and facilities it would need to be large. Also like I said local police budget cuts are a millions times easier than cutting the national defense budget

3846,2020-08-20 13:45:15,idaddi,My favorite 12 ga pump is the Winchester 1897. They can be a bit pricey but if you find a good one you'll be set.
3847,2020-08-20 13:50:03,idaddi,"A used Police Trade in 870 Wingmaster would be a great first gun.  It'll come with a short home defense barrel  CDNN sells Target Sport Tactical (ie Chyna*) 870 barrels in 28"" barrel lengths that are threaded for chokes.  That would be an ideal clay shooting barrel length and chokes give you the ability to adjust for the specific game you're shooting. A new Mossberg 500 would also be a great option.  I'd go no shorter than 26"" for sporting use.  28"" seems to be about ideal to compromise for most clayshooting sports. 

S&W Model 10-10 or earlier revision is about the best revolver for the dollar spent. Police trade guns are cheap and pop up frequently.  38 special is easy to reload.  Most people with a 357 shoot 38 special 99% of the time anyway, so to me, its a non issue having a gun only chambered in 38 special. 

Recon still has VZ 61 stuff.  Its kind of a useless gun unless you SBR it.  I got a parts kit to play around with on a 3d printed reciever with a pistol brace.  Again, not really practical but cool.

CZ bolt 22 rifles are top notch guns.  Savage 22 rifles shoot just as well, but the CZ is a much nicer firearm."
3848,2020-08-20 13:48:06,idaddi,"This is purely gun money, and not related to any other cash/funding/flow. I was leveraging the current market to sell some stuff I haven't ever _liked_."
3849,2020-08-20 13:47:25,idaddi,I'll take a look. What do you like about it?
3850,2020-08-20 13:51:43,idaddi,"First and foremost it's robust and reliable, finding a take down isn't that difficult, you can slam fire it (not just a fun novelty but gives you an incredibly quick follow up when shooting clays), it was designed by JMB, it has a great history."
3851,2020-08-20 13:57:10,idaddi,"I guess I did a shit job of explaining this, but none of 'em are first guns. I've been leveraging the panic to sell used stuff I don't like for a fair price - not gouging but not taking a huge loss either.

I don't have any shotguns, so I was hoping to correct that. And boy was I wrong on overall length. I didn't think to look for police trade Wingmasters, I assumed they would be gone totally.

I assumed the 10-10s would all be bought up by panic buyers. It was my first general though, since I don't plan to do anything but fun target shooting and 38's out of anything anyway.

VZ I would end up doing an SBR eventually."
3852,2020-08-20 14:14:57,idaddi,"My bad, I misspoke.  I meant to say first/only shotgun.  I had caught on that you're familiar with gats. 

Not sure what the current status on in stock 870s is, but I suspect they're still out there.  I don't think panic buyers bought up all the model 10 revolvers. 

You do allude to project guns.  Both options above could be a good intro to proper metal refinishing.  Rust bluing and stump remover bluing and relatively simple."
3853,2020-08-20 14:55:50,idaddi,I like the 870/10 idea. Very retro-cool.
3854,2020-08-20 15:34:49,idaddi,"I concur, old police 870’s and wingmasters are fantastic. I’d get a Model 15 but you can’t find them for Model 10 prices. 

Normally I’d throw out the Benelli Nova but they’re just so out of stock. Even the FN P12 isn’t in stock, and I didn’t know anybody knew about the FN P12. So old is the way to buy right now in my opinion."
3855,2020-08-20 15:47:23,idaddi,Finding any 870 or Wingmaster right now is pretty much a lost cause. Hell I'm not sure where to find a 10 right now.
3856,2020-08-20 15:55:41,idaddi,Yeah the move might just be certain revolvers and lever actions then. I barely found a 586 in stock.

3862,2020-08-20 13:52:38,idabii,Very good analysis! I wouldnt be mad if the order (16-10) you have went out when they did. I love Jaysar with all my heart and believe they can save this season but the odds are stacked against them. At least if they make the placement you have them listed (battle back pending) they would make jury (Kaysar for the first time!)
3863,2020-08-20 14:07:41,idabii,"I might move Cody down a little bit because I think he could be easily targeted, but definitely agree with everything else on this list"
3864,2020-08-20 15:57:18,idabii,"I think these are great power rankings, and think you are dead on about 8-16. Sure Janelle is public enemy #1, and 2 of  David, Kevin and Da'Vonne  will likely make jury- but I don't see how anyone can argue any of them have any sort of power in the game. 

 I feel like an Ian HOH will 100 percent be used by the crew in power to get rid of Memphis. 

I'm not sure if Bayleigh will be able to slink as far as we think without Da'Vonne but only time will tell. She was  probably  the most liked outsider by Level 6 at this point in the game in BB20 and we see how that turned out for her. 

I think once Jaysar are out of the picture- the game will become Tyler v. Nicole F. and a battle to see who the house voting minions truly belong to. The great thing for Nicole F. is that she is so well insulated by Ian, Cody and Dani. Even as a member of the House of Janelle, I cant deny that Nicole F. is a great player. 

Enzo is playing great right now but I think he will be cut in the late jury. He's so likable and I don't think he has the killer instinct when it will come down to him and his alliance to cut them first. 

I really think Christmas is a lock for second place this year. She is going to be so comfortable and is gonna play it so safe for so long in this game."
3865,2020-08-20 14:22:17,idabii,"People are way too low on Kevin. There is zero chance he goes before jury, as the big alliance now knows thery need to get Jaysar and Jaysar are going for the throat on the big alliance. This would have been the week to be a casualty. Kevin can have the worst read in the universe but there is no way in hell he goes anywhere for the next 4 weeks (assuming we get at least one week with Jaysar/Bay/Day/Kevin hoh) and by that point the large alliance will be crumbling. Kevin is in the Nicole Anthony spot from last season, and there is a very good chance come mid point he can easily play both sides, and seeing as he has done that already in season 11 I have full belief he can do it again.

Kevin, while being currently clueless, is in arguably one of the safest positions right now due to no one wanting to waste an hoh anymore. Only fear would be another Memphis HOH, but how likely is that realistically in the next three weeks?"
3866,2020-08-20 18:28:38,idabii,"fair list, but I'd rank Enzo a little lower - he hasn't shown me that he can independently play his game.  While he's got a great social game and is a good character, I see him as a mole for Cody - he just seems to too comfortable in the Robin role, never aspiring to be Batman.

Tyler worries me because he can be easily exposed."
3867,2020-08-20 14:13:13,idabii,Bayleigh will win. Mark my words
3868,2020-08-20 16:30:18,idabii,Can we cancel Memphis??
3869,2020-08-20 14:56:06,idabii,"While I do agree that Kevin doesn’t have a big target on him and the possibility of him making if to atleast the jury, I still stand by my opinion that Kevin played terribly in the first two weeks."
3870,2020-08-20 15:10:09,idabii,I’m not sure...  I feel like only Cody and maybe Franzel put Jaysar right up on the block. Kevin is highly likely to be used as a pawn or an easier target for anyone else.
3871,2020-08-20 17:37:32,idabii,"stop being so weak minded my love, this is big brother, not fox news"
3872,2020-08-20 14:59:55,idabii,"When you consider he was put on the block week 1 and Janelle campaigned really hard against him, I don't acutally think he has played all that terrible. Quite frankly joining Janelles side would have put him in a terrible position.

 He had one job of not getting nominated as a casualty before the war started and he succeeded at that."
3873,2020-08-20 15:18:21,idabii,"Tyler and Dani know that they are coming after them as well. This means that Christmas will target them if Tyler wants. Enzo is the only question mark of that group who might not put them up, but if Enzo is smart he throws the next few HOH comps because he is untouchable right now."
3874,2020-08-20 18:23:20,idabii,Okay... I still want him cancelled
3875,2020-08-21 01:57:09,idabii,"I rather Nicole F get cancelled because she wants to un-invite Janelle to her wedding when Nicole F gets HOH and nominates her, ugh. So petty. I will love it if she's 22/23 but she's 29 so..."
3876,2020-08-21 02:22:58,idabii,"Nicole F is the most whiney baby to play, fine with me cancel her too"

It says so much about his situation! Bronze and iron and runes as a magical ward. I'm reminded of these comment on the Royce bronze armour etched with runes

Because GRRM takes the micky out the ancestral runes, I ask myself just how important runes are in the saga.

LOTR! I was intrigued by the 9 and 7 in your post. I seem to find LOTR homages on every reread and liked yours very much, especially the 9.

I was sorry Theon's crown gets no love

Last of all, he donned his crown, a band of cold iron slim as a finger, set with heavy chunks of black diamond and nuggets of gold. It was misshapen and ugly, but there was no help for that. Mikken lay buried in the lichyard, and the new smith was capable of little more than nails and horseshoes. Theon consoled himself with the reminder that it was only a prince's crown. He would have something much finer when he was crowned king.

With the Runes, though, it could be that they only protect against certain external things. So the Runes don't protect against steel attacks, but mayhaps an Others' ice-sword? Although, I'm a little torn on whether ancient Starks were actually the og cold bad guys that people needed protecting from(Winter is Coming), so I don't know if the use of iron/bronze/Runes applies there. 

Not even joking, I'm wondering if Others vs. Dragonriders vs Rhoynish water magic vs Stonemen magic is a big ole ""rock, paper, scissors"" game. Come on George!

Mayhaps, but I thought the nine and the seven were pretty good.  
As for the runes, well. 
When the cunieform library of Sumer was discovered, it was thought they'd uncovered a trove of philosophy, poetry, or science. 
It turns out the thousands of little tablets were inventories of wheat, cows, sheep and so forth.  

IRL, the majority of runes form part of boundary markers or burial memorials.

3906,2020-08-21 11:40:12,id74t0,"I think that most magic in ASoIaF requires sacrifice, an exchange. This has been made quite clear in showing how effective blood magic is, and how even the Kiss of Life takes its toll on those it resurrects. Even warging has its dangers if you're not careful.

The Royces have various set of bronze rune-engraved armor. But simply engraving runes in bronze probably isn't enough to give them any actual power. Perhaps there is one actual magic armor in the Royce's armory, but even they don't know which one is which and believe all of them to be enchanted."

I agree, the letter was such a put down of him. But maybe the guy is so egotistical that he could see it only as showing how stupid Lacy was being in not appreciating him. After all, it is clear that he had been associating big time with people who were telling him relentlessly what a useless DA she was. Think Steve Thomas, Mark Beckner, Jane Harmer and all the other BPD people he thanks at the front of his book. I have no doubt that not only were they giving him information and helping him out in every way they could (go to the page in his book with the photo that Shelley Hisey **BPD**) took for him of his precious train track point against a ruler), they were giving hime **every** encouragement to write it. And Beckner never once complained about the case material he had in there. Contrast that with the huge fuss he made when Steve Ainsworth spoke out once, I forget what it was but it was very minor yet Beckner was outraged."

I used to think the BPD was just inept and inexperienced but now I think it goes a level deeper and they have no interest in solving this case. Too many careers on the line.

Then again, if Lacy was only threatening to sue if Kolar didn't 'shut up' I wonder why she didn't when 5 years later he published his book? Oh of course, she was no longer DA in 2012 was she? It was that Garnett, the one who gave the case back to Boulder Police in 2009. It all makes sense."
3918,2020-08-20 11:35:09,id5qi7,I have no idea. I'm totally obsessed with this case and I just wish there was something being done to solve it
3919,2020-08-21 14:49:19,id5qi7,"To clarify: I don't think Lacy was threatening to sue Kolar at all. She couldn't sue Kolar if she wanted to (regardless of what Kolar did, she lacked standing). I think she said that in the hopes of scaring him into thinking someone else (who could sue him) might sue him.

To sue someone, you need to prove that you were injured by them (physically, financially, emotionally, etc.). The only people who could sue Kolar are people who could demonstrate that they were injured by him. I don't think Lacy is suggesting she would sue, but that he is now vulnerable to law suits because he no longer has qualified immunity as an investigator (i.e. anything you do as an investigator is very hard to sue over and she's saying that because he was outside the bounds of that, he no longer had that immunity). 

It's like a doctor saying, ""You should really get a flu vaccine. If you don't, you are vulnerable to getting the flu."" The doctor isn't threatening to give you the flu, she's telling you that there is a threat from the flu."
3920,2020-08-20 11:49:51,id5qi7,"I feel the same way . I have noticed Kolar, unlike Thomas, skirts around what his theory is and I assume that is due to the possibility of legal action."

3922,2020-08-21 05:30:52,id5qi7,"Yeah, I think he consulted with lawyers before publishing. But Lacy's letter to him was written long before his book came out. 

She said this in her letter ""When you departed from the employment of the Boulder District Attorney's Office in March of 2006, your wall as an investigator with this office terminated. The Ramsey case is still under my control. **You have continued to proceed outside the limits of your jurisdiction. It appears that you have utilized confidential information that should legally have remained under the control of my office.** This is quite concerning to me and tonight management staff to place their trust in your professionalism.""

3982,2020-08-20 14:23:08,id5gns,"I think as shocking as Sidebottom's was, Hunter drink driving and crashing WHILE breaking the protocols pushes him just ahead."
3983,2020-08-20 12:26:29,id5gns,Fixed! I would definitely argue that Sidebottom and Taylor are extremely strong contenders in the Oopsie-Doo race. I hadn't even considered a non-player for the medal. You have given me plenty to think about.

3991,2020-08-20 12:25:25,id5gns,Yes but I am pretty confident he received no sanction so therefore he gets no points.
3992,2020-08-20 12:27:32,id5gns,If your suspensions were suspended does that mean I should bump you up to 34 points? /s

4006,2020-08-20 13:12:47,id5gns,Thanks man. I get the downvote for being a little lazy but I also got my answer. Best of luck at the pointy end. Of course I would like for our teams to meet when it matters.

4010,2020-08-20 08:45:24,id5gns,Nope but that does put him in solid contention with Taylor for the Oopsie-Doo medal.

Wiggins was third in contested shots on defense per game amongst non-centers in the league. The only two higher than him were Giannis and Pascal. Brook Lopez and Gobert are 1 and 2 overall.

4016,2020-08-20 05:47:45,id4d18,"I mean the Wolves are a terrible organization and the Warriors are a really good organization, he's not going to be Maple Jordan but guys with his skillsets can look VERY good in the Warriors lineup, y'all remember Barnes?"
4017,2020-08-20 05:23:06,id4d18,Nothing you say is going to raise that soft pony boy's trade value Kerr.
4018,2020-08-20 05:27:45,id4d18,Steven?
4019,2020-08-20 05:26:43,id4d18,Yall said the same shit about D-Lo
4020,2020-08-20 05:30:48,id4d18,Ya he's getting traded. They said the same about D'Angelo lol

4022,2020-08-20 06:31:10,id4d18,Do you think he's excited? Or is it just that it's all so exciting?
4023,2020-08-20 20:18:00,id4d18,"Ah yes, my favourite player, Stephand Klay."
4024,2020-08-20 05:28:35,id4d18,So they keeping him or trading him?

4029,2020-08-20 07:42:59,id4d18,He might have said something very similar about being excited about the potential a good player like that can change a team... but that doesn’t take away from what he’s saying here.
4030,2020-08-20 12:11:22,id4d18,"You’re right, but I would say this is a completely different situation.  The DLo sign/trade was made specifically to give them the fl civility to make a trade like this.

As a TWolves I was ready to see him go and was very disappointed with his lack of progress from his rookie year.  However I think he’s going to be awesome there.  He really is a talented player that seems to fit perfect with their personnel and style of play."
4031,2020-08-20 05:55:44,id4d18,stay gold Andrew wiggins
4032,2020-08-20 05:27:55,id4d18,"I mean, would anything really raise his value at this point? If Wiggins ""exceeds"" whatever expectations there are for him next year it's not like anyone would buy into it cause the general sentiment will be, ""he had Steph, Klay and Draymond and the Warriors know how to develop players, of course he performed well.""

A team will take Wiggins if the draft pick(s) attached to him are the right price, but we all know he's never going to be the focal point of a trade. Kerr's just saying the only thing he can cause it's what the situation currently is, until it changes like it did with DLo."
4033,2020-08-20 05:38:47,id4d18,Why do y’all want him to fail so much. Lift up dont step on.
4034,2020-08-20 05:30:05,id4d18,Stephand?
4035,2020-08-20 05:29:05,id4d18,Yeah I made a typo. My bad
4036,2020-08-20 16:11:25,id4d18,"Yea but we actually need a good sf, why tf would we max out dlo when we already have steph and klay. Wiggins fits the team better."
4037,2020-08-20 05:30:32,id4d18,God forbid an NBA fan who sees bullshit calls bullshit
4038,2020-08-20 11:13:31,id4d18,Wiggins is on a max contract and was a very big negative player for the Wolves. If he shows he can be a legit contributor that would be a huge deal
4039,2020-08-20 06:31:26,id4d18,"Plus if hes gonna do well anywhere its GSW with steph and klay, not some 20 win minnesota bum team lol"

4045,2020-08-20 05:32:05,id4d18,"Lmao, the fuck else is Kerr supposed to say? Idk why this shit is even getting posted here cause it's not worth its own thread but the OP is /u/wiggins-better so I guess it makes sense"
4046,2020-08-20 12:07:59,id4d18,Nah Wiggins is a better fit with the core starters and the way they prefer their system than Dlo. He also did bust his ass on defense when he got there. He is a good cutter/driver doesnt have a good handle but we have willing passers.
4047,2020-08-20 11:42:49,id4d18,The Wolves have never and will never be good. They are the Knicks but without the rings and worse for longer.

4059,2020-08-20 10:29:08,id3ros,"There's been tons of ""celebrity comics"" since the 1940s (Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, lots of Western actors). DC did a long run of Bob Hope, Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis books in the 50s and 60s, then Dark Horse (and now Dynamite) had a few Bettie Page miniseries in the 90s. A lot of the bigger companies have moved away from these types of books, but tons of smaller companies do various political figure parody books every now and then."
4060,2020-08-20 06:20:30,id3ros,"Honestly, I’m struggling to think of why anyone would want this except for maybe as some kind of poor selling comedy one shot at best. Like even if these weren’t abysmal casting choices, I don’t know why people would want this or what the point would even be, and that’s not even getting into the legal/financial nightmare it would be for them to get permission to use those names and likenesses. It would cost them a lot more than it would make them."

I think there is a similar argument for the smithmorra . Black can always just ignore you and play their line against the Alapin (generally either nf6 or d5) and again you have to know an extra line."

When the paragraph started 'As black...', I thought that paragraph would discuss his play as black. I now see OP switched back in the second sentence to his play as white.

Every opening you mentioned though can be played at a high level so I can assure you that they won’t prevent you from being a strong player. If you really care about improving, put together a solid training routine and stick with it."

The BoM is one of his ""stump speeches"" that he falls back on when it is evident that he doesn't have another topic of interest to him.

Apostles are just figureheads who must fall in line and obey the agenda set forth by the president of the 12 (the most senior apostle) or the First Presidency. If you aren’t in that position, it’s your job to lick the boots and do what you’re told and if you are lucky enough to outlive everyone – then you can have a turn of carrying out your agenda."

4145,2020-08-20 06:27:42,iczotg,"I definitely think the church is starting to realize they can’t keep banking on literalism, but they’re far from giving it up. I’m comfortable saying at least 75% of active TBM are various degrees of literalistic believers. Of that 75%, I’d say only 25% are all the way literal and uncompromising in any of it. The rest are willing to let go of the literal aspects and could easily transition — however, that smaller percentage of literal believers are more than likely the most active, most consistent with tithes, and are all in on anything the church does. The church is at a cross roads; go with the larger crowd who *might* fudge their tithes, *might* miss a Sunday here or there, *might* birth future members who *might* not stay active... or, go with the smaller bit more dedicated crowd who will pay their full tithing (plus fast offerings), will never miss a Sunday unless they’re dying, will raise their kids on the straight and narrow 100% no matter what it takes, and I’m general let their whole worlds revolve around the church. I’m not saying the larger crowd are likely to be worse members — I’ve known amazing families in the church who have a kid or two who left the church — but most are far from what the church likes to promote on the Ensign."
4146,2020-08-20 13:27:02,iczotg,"I don't know about David, but I do believe that JRH has been going through some type of transformation in the past year or two. When I read his words I notice a distinct change. I think he still advocates hard for the Church and would not label him PIMO, but I also think he sees the societal problems of the world to be a high priority. Take at look at this section (which I think was the most inspiring portion of the entire conference):

>When we have conquered this \[COVID-19\] ﻿—and we will﻿—may we be equally committed to freeing the world from the virus of hunger, freeing neighborhoods and nations from the virus of poverty. May we hope for schools where students are taught﻿—not terrified they will be shot﻿—and for the gift of personal dignity for every child of God, unmarred by *any* form of racial, ethnic, or religious prejudice.  
>  
>...  
>  
>Brothers and sisters, we know what some of the religious deficiencies in the early 19th century were. Furthermore, we know something of today’s religious shortcomings that still leave the hunger and hope of some unfulfilled. We know a variety of those dissatisfactions are leading some away from traditional ecclesiastical institutions. We also know, as one frustrated writer wrote, that “many religious leaders \[of the day\] seem clueless” in addressing this kind of decline, offering in response “a thin gruel of therapeutic deism, cheap symbolic activism, carefully couched heresy, \[or sometimes just\] uninspiring nonsense”—and all at a time when the world needs so much more, when the rising generation deserves so much more, and when in Jesus’s day He offered so much more. As disciples of Christ, we can in our day rise above those ancient Israelites who moaned, “Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost.”

Anyway, he at least seems to reference some understanding of the pain that others feel, and a sense that the Church has a responsibility to help alleviate it. Long story short, it would not surprise me at all if eventually, because of his influence, the Church's humanitarian and social justice efforts increase tremendously."

It's the same with the Book of Mormon, it's origins are important but what's more important is what's inside, what is says and what it instructs.

Holland hangs onto a few parts of the BOM he finds devine, and that is enough to fire up the boilers that power his bold,  lie to your face persona, without his conscience overwhelming or betraying him in the moment. (He still is conflicted after)

 Holland is lying. His  conference comment about a member needing to ""crawl over and around the BOA to make an exit"" are  **all bluster and showmanship**... 
Please connect the dots here. Consider  [Hollands conference talk when he said this](https://knowhy.bookofmormoncentral.org/knowhy/an-apostles-witness) 

In this same ""I bear you my sacred apostolic witness"" talk, Holland also lacked integrity and held up a fake copy of the book of mormon and [made a bold faced lie](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/9sp604/audio_examination_of_elder_hollands_seeming/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) that it was Hyrum Smith's wife's copy.

 I dont think you grasp how two faced the q15 are. The men you see in conference are very different in private.

 (Though they believe they are lying to you out of love, because they feel the members are too stupid to process a more nuanced belief in mormonism)"
4170,2020-08-21 00:59:00,iczotg,"They can already track this effect by looking at the donations comming coming from liberal v.s. conservative wards. If the goal of the church is to optimize tithing revenue, you can argue at first that the church will never change.
But the relationship between orthodoxy = more tithing is not a simple correlation and has a bunch of other variables to consider.

There is an inflection point where too much orthodoxy makes the church too cult like and weird.... you risk people starting to think mormons are nuts and unstable.. Being a bishop or SP is not aspired to in the community anymore and the mormons are not considered cool. Then you loose 9 mormons and keep 1 crazy family, who's individual tithe does not make up for the 9 that paid less, but in total it was more.

And there is the ""free labor"" problem to consider: you just cant sustain a ward with the 5 hyper orthodox families. They cant do all the callings. You need a community. And that community demands you not inforce crazy beliefs.

Anywho...so they have to adapt. They wont pick orthodoxy and just watch membership #'s decline and chapels closed and bulldozed. (My theory anyway)"
4171,2020-08-20 14:28:03,iczotg,"Yes! This is Holland self critiquing his performance. Holland (et all) has  served members this ""thin gruel""  since the 1960's.

He knows he lied, he could have treated members as equals and adults, and dished up the REAL, hearty, facts that he, David and Bushman (privately!!l) believe...

4179,2020-08-20 04:47:48,iczotg,"The only reason Holland was cleared to do that interview was to help get Mitt Romney in the White House.  The q15 were soooo excited for what a mormon president would mean for THEM and their ""street cred""  it's kind of similar to how the q15 love ivy league degreed people and all things made by Apple.  It's just a shallow way to value the people around you and show how ""on trend"" you are.  ( oh and heres another inside comment. The apple store at citycreek pays zero $  for their lease.

I believe the LDS members and the World deserve enough respect that they should be allowed to see through some of the falsehoods presented as truth by the q15 and their families.

It's not like he needs to impress someone to keep his job or Anything.  He says this stuff because he believes it. 

His bringing the hammer down on the Maxwell institute, basically telling them to lie for the Lord also wouldn't have happened if he was pimo.

Why is it so hard for exmos to believe that the 12 believe?   They wouldn't doubt their former Bishop's belief or their former stake president, but for some reason they believe all of the 12 are a bunch of closet non believers.   It's ridiculous.  


These guys come from the ranks of the most strident believers and they are in a far more insulated bubble than any Bishop or Stake President is.   They are constantly experiencing elevation emotion and the worshipful praise of sycophants, all of which they perceive as God's Holy Spirit endorsing the church and their sacred calling.   

These guys fucking believe and they believe HARD.  Don't fool yourself.  I'll PM you in 10 years with an 'I told you so'."

4201,2020-08-20 13:29:00,iczotg,"I think you've read too much into my statement.  It's a matter of where I place my emphasis, I emphasise and prioritise reading the Book of Mormon as a Liahona or guide on my journey through life.  I'm not stressing about its origins.  Call me an ostrich but that's where I think the priority should be if the Book of Mormon is to have any influence in my life.  

I'm not dismissing your comment aside from that I think it's waaaaaaay out in left field, but I just don't think it's necessary to put effort like this of grooming the son of an Apostle etc etc.  

Christ has been depicted as white for a long time before the church came along.  If Jesus was truly of Jewish descent then I would say we should look to the Jews for any indication of Christs skin colour.  If we look to the Jews the answer becomes a little more clear.  Let me ask you, are the Jews (the majority of them) white or are they black?

It's not preached because it is NOT IMPORTANT!!!  I would say however that it would be reasonable to depict adam and eve in the endowment as back for the Saints in Africa.  I think it would be good to do the same for the Saints in Phillipines but race should not be an issue.  

You are missing the mark sir!"

David had a faith crisis years ago. Talked though it with David Bushman and other apologists personally over a period of years. One of the things Jeffery admires in his son is how David took a hard look at the church rather than say  ""i dont profess to know Egyptian"" (Holland bbc interview) and put it on the shelf and be done with it.

 David has also helped his father with a more nuanced belief."

I can also see that argument that he is aware of the issues and is simply on a double down. To me awareness and double down equal sunk cost efforts. 

Guess if I’m gonna get downvoted for asking a clarification question I should go all the way and earn it. Fuck that taffy pulling dodo dickhead. RFM played his stake conference recording where he said the church is adding double digit stakes weekly and then he gets angry at those that leave.

One thing that **is** an eternal principle of mormonism: changing any docterine, temple ordinance or church policy when you finally realize it hurts you. 


Polygamy = no statehood? Boom law.of celestial marriage in the dumpster

Holland has discussed his PIMO beliefs with Richard Bushman and his son for over 20 years. None of them are MI, though they do agree there are events that were unique (devine?) that allowed the church to grow...

Put another way: do you believe Bill Gates was devinely inspired and foreordained to ""bring to pass"" the gospel of the personal computer? 

Not really. Gates found himself in a unique period in history where he was able to use his talents to align with the world around him and create something... Microsoft was the result. It could just as well been someone else...who could have done it better (or worse)."

I get it. So, mentally out for you (and me) really means not holding a *literal* belief but still liking the good aspects of the church.... so maybe PILBO.  ""Physically in, literal belief out""

4229,2020-08-23 16:29:18,iczotg,"Sigh. ok I'll explain again... :)


1) JRH through his professional study of early American history, the [restoration movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restoration_Movement) and the [2nd awakening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Great_Awakening) learned the Mormon church was far from unique and not devinely led.


2) JRH through further study and professional contacts, encountered the real history of Joseph Smith. Which required JRH to adopt a PIMO belief.


3) By the time JRH's was a SP,  he knew he needed to hide his growing PIMO belief if he wanted to be promoted to the next level and start to get a paycheck and make a career out of his mormon beliefs.


4) As Holland rose up in the ranks further, he hid his PIMO beliefs even more, realising that to be seen as even ***remotely*** liberal = death to your LDS career. However, JRH found maybe 50% of the q70 and above were also secretly PIMO, and realised the art of believing one thing while professing another form of literal belief to the members was common... and even an implied part of the job of an LDS church leader. [see pious fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pious_fraud)


5) JRH got better at this dishonest game, but through conversations with family, children, and close friends, realised that the lies were not sustainable, and the LDS church would someday need to come clean and quit lying to its members. He realised he was stuck in his lies, but his sons could be positioned to provide this when the church was ready.


6) Hollands son has made a study of how to take religious and other texts non literally, and still show they have value for faith. When JRH is called as prophet, they plan to  make non literal belief in the BOM acceptable, and roll this out to the church."
4230,2020-08-21 01:51:42,iczotg,He’ll probably be dead by then...
4231,2020-08-20 16:01:20,iczotg,Yes
4232,2020-08-23 18:04:34,iczotg,"Well, I don't think I misunderstood, but thank you for recapping. 

First of all I would say their are an awful lot of assumptions here and the more assumptions the more likely to be wrong, but let's say many of your assumptions are correct. 

The primary evidence for his belief is, in fact, his testimony since becoming a senior member of the 12, which is strident and orthodox in churchwide settings and more intimate settings.  


Their is zero reason for this if you are pimo at this stage.  You will become prophet if you live long enough barring, some grievious public sin.  You are untouchable.  The worst that can happen is an orthodox prophet keeps you out of the first presidency, but who cares about that anyway.  if you live long enough you will be king and no one can touch you in the interim.  Their simply is no need to lie.  Maybe you can't admit you don't really believe anymore, but you sure as hell don't need to step on the gas of orthodoxy 

Moreover, why would you make it harder for your son to redirect the ship by being so strident in your testimony about the truth claims.  Why fuck your son over that way.  Wouldn't you help him by at least backing off the truth claims and focusing on grace and love and the more nuanced belief.  Even better, try to turn the ship a little bit yourself.  To do otherwise is a cowardly and dickish fatherly move.  


Lastly, I think you may underestimate the bubble these guys are in as Q15.  It's a constant hit of elevation emotion, a spiritual high man.  People are dam near close to kneeling when you walk in a room.  Everyone is telling you bullshit conversion stories and miracle stores and sucking up to you.  You constantly get the holy ghost chicken skin as you give talks and get all treary eyed.  That shit fucks with your mind and makes it very hard to offend God by facing your cog dis.   Hell, when I went home from high council meetings I was on a spiritual high that made me act like I had vip spiritual powers and that was literally nothing.   

Your theory is interesting but fails Occam's razor.  The simplest answer is that he means what he says.   

If I had to guess which one was PIMO I would have guessed Monson.  That dude mostly just spoke about feel good stuff, not over under and around the book of mormon testimony.

Nice discussion.  Who really knows.  It's all conjecture."
4233,2020-08-23 18:21:40,iczotg,"Its not conjecture. 

When you are in the family of the apostles, you learn first hand how this two faced behavior works.


They ""turn on"" church mode when speaking to the public and members, just like any performer becomes the character they are cast to emulate.


 You never see the real men unless you are in their secret circle. 

 You dont have to believe me... but I'm putting this out because I respect LDS members. LDS members  have a right to know they are being lied to. [Mat 13:9](https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=mateo%2013:9-16%3B-lucas-8:5-11)"

2. Practice switches on the perimeter all day long
3. Only Jokic and MPJ shoot unless someone is wide open. 
4. If MPJ is playing with the bench, he is the first option, followed by Monte. No one else should be shooting
5. Start Grant over Milsap"
4302,2020-08-19 22:57:33,icy23f,"About 6 minutes into the third Utah had made 16 threes

They closed out with a franchise playoff record (one of the top ten made threes games all time in the playoffs), other games required OT to reach that and this one was just regulation.

The percentage is weighed down by the final meaningless minutes where folks were chucking

Utah won the game because they hit an unsustainably large number of three pointers early in the game and you just don't lose games when you take the most valuable shot and hit it every time.

We'll bounce back."

Hard to beat any team five times in a row let alone the sixth seed in the West"
4304,2020-08-19 22:47:26,icy23f,"Before the game I asked whether the Nuggets would take the next step as contenders by burying a team when they are up. The answer was a *resounding* no. These Nuggets fall to 0-4 in the playoffs when going into the game with a series lead.

That being said, one thing they proved these last couple of years is that they are resilient as fuck. Expect them to bounce back in Game 3."
4305,2020-08-20 00:25:58,icy23f,"Call me crazy but I think we need to throw something at them they're not expecting.   


Start Monte/Murray/MPJ/Grant/Jokic. Utah straight up dared Craig and Millsap to shoot wide open threes. Who are they going to do that to in that lineup?   


Then you bring Craig off the bench as soon as Clarkson's in the game, because he's the guy we really need to stop. If he averages 20 per game we're cooked.   


The bench unit is offensively challenged but super long on defense with PJ running point.   


I just think it's bad basketball to have two non-shooters on the court when the Jokic/Murray two man game can collapse any defense, and we should try to run their starters off the floor rather than try to be this defensive juggernaut that we're obviously not."
4306,2020-08-19 22:54:11,icy23f,We got slapped down HARD. It’s a healthy reminder that we aren’t shit until we’ve accomplished something.
4307,2020-08-19 22:37:53,icy23f,Malone please run plays for MPJ only seen about 2 off ball screens for him all game most of his buckets came from just standing in the corner drilling shots
4308,2020-08-19 23:49:18,icy23f,Utah went 1-11 on their last 11 attempts from three point range and STILL managed to finish the game at 46% from three. That’s outrageous.
4309,2020-08-19 22:37:02,icy23f,And THAT is why people still think we are pretenders
4310,2020-08-19 22:59:14,icy23f,"Other things that bother me:

1. Didn't happen too much this game, but in general, when Jokic makes an amazing pass to a runner or in the P&R, there is this weird tendency for our guys to finish the play at the rim even when its a bad decision. Almost like they feel an obligation to do so because Jokic made such a good pass. It's ok to pass it out. Sometimes you just can't score on two defenders in the paint

2. I don't like when Jamal Murray forces bad drives and almost vertical fade aways just to get hot. I get that he's solid at making the fadeaways at least, but when you're not in rhythm, just play it safe. It was even weird to see Jokic have a couple of forced drives on Rudy today, but that's an anomaly for him. I just want Murray to play with the flow rather than try to get himself into a game.

3. Milsap doing anything other than taking open threes on offense. I don't want to see him creating his own shots.

4. Obviously the MPJ ice outs. He should be your second/third option (probably second). Look for him (this goes to Jokic and Murray when they have a ball.

5. We're always a step behind on defense. Our lack of defensive inensity bothers me. Its bothered me for years now. The minimum requirement to playing good defense is intensity.

6. Malone needs to come up with better set plays out of time outs.

7. Malone tends to be late with his defensive adjustments. He's a bit hard headed when it comes to adapting mid-game. 

8. I worry that the 2-man game with Jokic and Murray has been figured out by now. It will still be effective, but we need alternatives (that still involve Jokic).

Rant over."
4311,2020-08-19 22:40:34,icy23f,"We are a momentum team. I felt like after that 6 missed layups possession, we lost a lot of confidence. Add constant 3a to that, that will deflate you. MPJ gained confidence though so not a total loss."
4312,2020-08-19 23:46:59,icy23f,"What’s up, folks.

It’s Ray, the blogboy who took a few days off from the grind, back with another recap and my person takeaways from the second game of the Nuggets vs. Jazz series on August 19th.

This was a rough game. The Jazz controlled this one from wire to wire, more or less. Leaders of the team looked assertive (Jokic, Murray, Porter) but the team as a whole struggled to get involved offensively. The team had some good defensive possessions here and there, but also a lot of bad ones. As the offense stagnated through the second quarter, the defense faltered along with it. 

In particular, a tactic became clear. The Nuggets applied pressure on Mitchell in this one to force the surrounding guys to make shots. They made shots, and a lot of them. On top of that, Donovan Mitchell was fresh in the third and made multiple big shots to cement the win. Most of the fourth was garbage time.

Some interesting stats from this one:

The Jazz shot 44 threes in this game. The Nuggets shot 27, including 2 each from Jokic and Murray, as well as 1 each from Milsap and Craig. 

My takeways:

**Jamal needs to shoot more threes**

2 is not enough, in any circumstance. It’s not just Murray having a limited scoring output, but the paint really gets condensed when your point guard is not spacing the floor.

**Porter bounces back offensively**

MPJ had a really nice game on one end of the floor tonight, which is a big step above neither end.

**The Nuggets are better off when Mitchell is the only one scoring**

Time will tell if that remains true, but the Nuggets were hurt much more by forcing Mitchell to pass, effectively forcing the Jazz to run a healthier offense.

**Gary Harris is sorely missed**

Torrey Craig is getting all he can handle defensively in this series and it would be really nice to have Gary Harris to take over cover Mitchell when Craig is off the floor, or to have multiple plus defenders for switches.

Hopefully we bounce back in game 3. I've been working on clipping some videos so that may be a thing in the coming days.

All the best,

Ray"
4313,2020-08-19 23:06:42,icy23f,"The Nuggets need the Avalanche to give them a preseason speech next year. The Avs very clearly have something the nuggets don't: A team-wide killer instinct. They smelled blood in game four and have been absolutely destroying Phoenix ever since. When the nuggets smell blood they take their foot off the gas, lose focus, and let the other team back in the game.   
Aside from developing that, we need:  


Jokic needs to sell contact better and shoot 6+ FTs per game. 

  
Jamal needs to be consistent from game to game  


We need a new defense scheme that stops leaving shooters wide open from three."
4314,2020-08-20 01:21:33,icy23f,"Every team in the west is tough right now. The only pushover would have been Memphis, but Portland got healthy and willed their way in. It doesn't matter who the Nuggets got matched up with, every series was going to be a grind. Jazz are no exception even without some of their key pieces, they're a good team with a good coach. 


I think the Nuggets can win it, but I never thought it was going to be a sweep. Let's see if game three goes a bit better."
4315,2020-08-19 22:37:32,icy23f,"Joker -23

Jamal -20

Grant -20

Just not good enough

Snyder made great adjustments and moach had no answers.

Only one game but so embarrassing.

Not happy."
4316,2020-08-19 23:06:04,icy23f,"Takeaways part 2: 

1) I’m confused/disappointed by the lack of ball movement, compared to years past. Not just tonight but seems like there was a deliberate decision to move away from the free flowing ball movement offense of old. I think this hurts us offensively and doesn’t maximize what Jokic does for you. I get the feeling this was intentional since this sort of offense is perceived as not a playoff type offense. I’m not sure I agree with that perception. 

2) one of the underrated negative consequences of losing Gary and Barton is we really miss their ability to cause turnovers. They are our first and third best SPG guys this year. Torrey is great at contesting shots but he is actually surprisingly bad at forcing turnovers for such an otherwise good defensive player. 

Utah with only six turnovers tonight is brutal. Have to find a way to wreak some havoc on the defensive end and get some easy points out of it."
4317,2020-08-19 22:32:39,icy23f,"The problem with Nugglife is no matter how used to it you get, no matter how obvious it is to see coming, it always hurts just the same."
4318,2020-08-19 22:40:00,icy23f,Even though Gary Harris wasn’t shooting well his defensive effort helps so damn much
4319,2020-08-20 01:21:48,icy23f,Fuck yeah philly got wrecked worse than us today
4320,2020-08-19 22:50:13,icy23f,"Biggest question for me is how do we respond to this performance. If we come back with some fire and win in game 3 this won’t concern me too much. 

Takeaways going forward: 1) I don’t think doubling Mitchell is the answer. He did a good job passing out of doubles today and it just led to open threes. We have to figure something out on the defensive end. We’ve been straight up dreadful since the restart about protecting the perimeter. I think we have to pick our poison a bit, and if we are picking open threes we are picking the wrong one. 

2) in the off-season we need to re-work the offensive scheme to make MPJ a central figure. He’s too good not to. 

3) I’ve never been a firemaloner and not saying we need to head in that direction, but it’s looking like we’ll be out coached in 3/3 playoff series over the last two years. I think our offense lacks creativity from a scheme standpoint and whatever we are doing on defense isn’t working either(obviously this is personnel in large part)I think Malone has earned some leash but it’s an area of concern for me.  I think a better X’s and O’s guys if we could get our hands on one could take us to the next level."
4321,2020-08-19 23:43:35,icy23f,"You know what? I'm convinced that Mitchell is going to get his. So why not just let him do it.   


Turn Craig into the Clarkson stopper. Bring him off the bench and put him in the game every time Clarkson steps on the floor."

4323,2020-08-19 22:42:13,icy23f,Jazz with 32 assists and 6 turnovers. Putting on a clinic.
4324,2020-08-19 23:17:19,icy23f,I just don’t understand what the actual game plan was. Just mindlessly driving into Rudy and Co when you know the refs aren’t blowing the whistle as much as you need to sustain? This was the type of game I’d like to see people just shooting 3s and staying with the hot hand. We were shooting pretty decent from behind the arc. Every time one of Jamal or Joker received a pass they’d just hesitate instead of committing to the shot and pass out. There was absolutely 0 offensive rhythm except for when MPJ shot it but he didn’t get the ball nearly as much as he should have. Just an absolutely perplexing game overall.
4325,2020-08-19 23:21:44,icy23f,I think its time to swap Grant for Millsap in the starting lineup.
4326,2020-08-20 08:14:51,icy23f,MPJ already an offensive juggernaut in the playoffs... scary.

4329,2020-08-19 22:41:19,icy23f,We gave up 77 points in two quarters (2nd + 3rd). Not going to win many games like that.

I just want to know what happened. He was training on his own right up until he got into the bubble. Then suddenly his hip is bad again. I know hip injuries are difficult, but what exactly is the issue? Was this something he should/could have had surgery for?"
4331,2020-08-20 00:02:47,icy23f,I think that TC did good job on Mitchel
4332,2020-08-20 00:13:14,icy23f,"I’m thinking it was a mistake to rest guys for the last week before the playoffs, the wind totally came out of the sails right before the end of the 1st half and I don’t think it was an effort thing, I think it was an energy thing. The good news is that will get better. 

Hopefully moach gives JG the start at 4 next game. Hopefully Gary comes back soon."
4333,2020-08-20 00:18:16,icy23f,"Just a few things:
1 - everyone missed a couple bunnies that normally go in and it looked like it got in their head.
2 - in the end of the second and into the third Snyder switched Gobert to guard milsap and that left him out of the Jokic/Murray pick and rolls and able to cheat in and help on any drives / backdoors / passing that normally comes in those situations. Great move by Snyder.
3 - Gobert’s moving screens on nearly every possession are frustrating as hell. 
4 - doubling Spida isn’t the answer. He’s gunna get his, but he dissected the d time and time again. 
5 - let’s hope that’s the dud game of the series in terms of intensity and not adjusting"
4334,2020-08-19 22:53:18,icy23f,Joe Ingles got wayyy too many wide open 3s today. Unacceptable effort and execution on defense.

4344,2020-08-20 02:06:19,icy23f,Gobert was unusually disruptive this game and Clarkson popped off. Still feeling confident in this squad. 4-2.
4345,2020-08-20 02:46:13,icy23f,"I thought Murray looked good on Mitchell and would like to see him get the matchup a little more more to give us more flexibility.  Moving Craig to one of the other shooters when they get hot should shut them down completely, and not having someone like Clarkson abusing our weakness on the perimeter would make a huge difference.

Porter's defense was an improvement, he showed some flashes and that's why experience is so important.  Glad to have a competitive series for these guys to learn and grow as players.  This is the 4th straight playoffs for this Jazz squad and it makes a big difference.

Most of the time the most serious contenders have quite a bit of playoff experience (or their star players do at least).

Looking forward to game 3.  It's going to be rough going back to Utah having dropped one of those crucial home games, but you have to be able to win on the road to have postseason success."
4346,2020-08-19 22:40:35,icy23f,"This probably isn’t the time or the place, but I’m glad Millsap’s contract is expiring. 
Lovely dude obviously, but time’s up."
4347,2020-08-19 22:51:04,icy23f,"Yes this was a complete beatdown, but there are a few silver linings. MPJs defense was improved (low bar yes, but it was almost acceptable at times,) Jokic still owns Gobert and can get whatever he wants on him, and Monte is continuing to show he can perform in the playoffs. A lot went wrong. We overreacted to Mitchell’s breakout game and I expect Malone to make some more adjustments in G3. No reason to lose faith at all. Expect Conley to make life easier for Denver, not harder."
4348,2020-08-19 22:33:26,icy23f,"Also this is what I hate about basketball. We sweep them this season, lock them up from 3.

4356,2020-08-19 23:46:49,icy23f,"Takeaways:

1. Turns out we need Harris and Barton pretty badly, but not sure they’ll be back this year or ever so this is what we have.

2. MPJ responds well to criticism and improves from game to game. His d still lags, but he was improved from last game and wasn’t any worse than the rest of the team. His offensive efficiency is a game changer and when he is shooting well he needs to be getting the ball more

3. Our lack of reps during the bubble regular season is showing. Im really questioning sitting our starters as much as we did when those minutes were invaluable for building rhythm and shaking off the rust. Too late now.

4. This series is going to be tough, but all things considered we are tied and still in it. We need to adjust and play more team basketball rather than jokic murray 2 man. 

5. Jamaal murray still has consistency issues."
4357,2020-08-19 22:36:57,icy23f,"Malone’s game plan left the team demoralized. Why tf would you change something that worked? Did he think Donovan was gonna go for 70 tonight? There is no possibly way he plays anyway better then he did last game. Just let Craig play him one on one and hope for favorable switches or don’t play Craig at all. It just doesn’t make sense, why even play Craig if you’re gonna double Mitchell anyway?"

4362,2020-08-19 22:36:58,icy23f,"Trying really hard not to be negative... but that was some truly uninspired basketball.

Nuggets better take that beatdown personally and go into game 3 with some fire because right now Utah’s confidence is sky high."
4363,2020-08-19 22:46:12,icy23f,Maybe Moach needs to do the same thing he did last playoffs and insert Grant into the starting lineup and benching Millsap. Grant won't be our saving grace but...
4364,2020-08-19 22:47:06,icy23f,"Without Gary the defense is a disaster. Jokic- Murray- MPJ and old Millsap are too slow and with weak lateral movements. Jokic and MPJ have very poor lateral movements in defense, Millsap is almost retired, and Murray is trying but very average in defense. We have no chance if Malone doesn't adjust the game. Why not use Diop and Troy. Grant must play instead of Millsap. This was sad to watch. Also, people do not understand that basketball is not just offensive. MPJ constantly loses a player, it's not a problem when he makes mistakes in rotation, but he often doesn't try, it's not serious that a young player doesn't fight in defense. He is great in attack but the defense is a total disaster. Last season we had in defense Gary and a fresher better Millsap. The two of them held our defense. Now we don't have Gary and Millsap is too slow and old, he looks like a recreational player. God help us if we pass Utah at all. Their coach is an excellent strategist and Malone will stubbornly force something that is not going to work. And top on that Jokic is not good, by his standards. He had Gary and Barton 2 fastest player in our team and thay were cut and run, this starting line up is slow and without movement. I never seen in the Play Off bad defense like our tonight. Malone must react. I don' t know, i have feeling that MPJ is to early in the great fire and so many mins. We need the defense, but with Jok- Murray- MPJ- old Millsap that is atrocity. Maybe Grant instead of Millsap, i don' t know."
4365,2020-08-19 22:49:09,icy23f,"So. Obviously much to be worked on, but I’m sure everyone here has something to say about that. So I’ll touch on the good. 

It’s one game, regardless of how bad this game looked and was, the series is tied 1-1 and we have 3 games guaranteed to play. 

MPJ got his and that can do nothing but help his confidence. Going into game 3, we should look to get him the ball more and use his offense. 

They shot 20/44 from deep. They are amazing shooting team but you can’t expect them to shoot like that again. 

From the tip they looked uninterested in the game. Hopefully use this as a wake up call

And finally, we’ve been here before. We had two long series last year, our main guys have been here and know how to react and adjust. 

Everyone relax, and be ready for Friday. Nuggets in 6."
4366,2020-08-19 22:54:59,icy23f,The Jazz played their best basketball without Conley this season (just saying)
4367,2020-08-19 23:09:52,icy23f,"Utah deserved this game with the way they played. Honestly I'm not even mad about the loss, because even if we had shot better it wouldn't have mattered. What's irritating though is the lack of energy & effort. In Game 1, we got severely out-rebounded, and in this game, we didn't play any defense at all, especially on the perimeter. Gave up wide open 3s, and got beat to the basket by their role players on 1 on 1 drives. If Mitchell is going to go off & beat us, so be it, but if their other guys go off, that's not a question of talent & more a question of effort. 

This was Utah's game, and they earned it. But we are the more talented team by far and we need to come out and play with intensity from the jump next game. I'm talking the full 48 minutes. And also more touches/shots for MPJ. He's too valuable to not use. This series is just getting started. Let's fuckin' win Game 3 fam."

see you later!"
4372,2020-08-19 22:36:12,icy23f,Lock em in the film room
4373,2020-08-19 22:49:10,icy23f,"I'll put this one on everyone being sad that Barton had to leave, but they better make an actual statement next game."
4374,2020-08-19 22:57:17,icy23f,Only got to watch Q1. Can someone explain what the fuck happened?
4375,2020-08-19 23:16:06,icy23f,Soo embarrassing
4376,2020-08-19 22:44:15,icy23f,outstanding game by the Jazz. we absolutely shit the bed. on to the next one!!
4377,2020-08-19 22:52:55,icy23f,I chalk this up to a ridiculous shooting performance by Utah. Yes our defense sucked but my lord they just couldn’t miss from anywhere. I think Malone will do some heavy work in the film room and get our guys together. I had a feeling the game would go this way. Playoffs are all about adapting as the games go. Our guys got this shit but it would help if we had Gary.
4378,2020-08-19 22:53:02,icy23f,I blame the Nuggets Twitter account for that fucking tweet Gobert and Mitchell liked lol.
4379,2020-08-20 02:27:51,icy23f,"murray took only 2 three pointers, cant compeete in 2020 with guards that are not a treath behind the arc"
4380,2020-08-19 22:34:05,icy23f,"Craig with zero points, 2 rebounds, and 2 assists in 30 minutes, that's insane to me."
4381,2020-08-19 23:30:52,icy23f,"People extremely underrate the Jazz for some reason on this sub. I said it will go to 7 before the series started and I still believe it will.

I can't stress enough how much we miss Gary Harris and Barton on D. Donovan, Clarkson are running circles around us. Being forced to play MPJ as a starter makes it even more difficult. 

Millsap is done and should be benched asap. Grant has to start if we want to take this series. 

The only thing I can see as positive is that Jokic gets his. Gobert being a great defender makes little difference for him. 28/11/6 in 31 minutes, can't expect much more at this point unless he gets put into position to hard carry like last year.

They looked very deflated overall throughout the game, that will probably change next game. It really showed so far that this team needs some fire up its ass to respond properly."
4382,2020-08-19 23:54:11,icy23f,I've heard this argument before. Spurs and Portland's shooting were unsustainable against the Nuggets last year... until they did it every game to take us to game 7.
4383,2020-08-20 03:36:23,icy23f,That Gobert block at the end of the second was huge. I hope the league offices watch that jersey holding he was doing all night.
4384,2020-08-19 22:38:26,icy23f,"Everyone, take cover!  

The mormons are coming with their ""Moving Screen Gogurt is the best center in the NBA"" takes."
4385,2020-08-19 22:33:31,icy23f,On to the next one.
4386,2020-08-19 22:34:18,icy23f,On to the next one.
4387,2020-08-19 22:34:54,icy23f,TBH I'm feeling this going to 6 or 7 games. Good news is there's no way the jazz shoot this well again in the series. Dig in.
4388,2020-08-19 22:35:46,icy23f,"Now that daniels is seemingly back from injury, I hope to see him get some quality minutes for 3pt bursts"
4389,2020-08-19 22:36:08,icy23f,Sure am glad I missed this one
4390,2020-08-19 22:36:55,icy23f,Can anyone spin this game so I don't feel so bad? Accepting any blind optimism or positive takes. Thanks.
4391,2020-08-19 22:49:27,icy23f,Where is Gary Harris? Is he expected back?
4392,2020-08-19 23:06:18,icy23f,Game 2 was today? I don't remember game 2 happening today
4393,2020-08-19 23:13:03,icy23f,Murray needs to shoot more. 14 pts today shooting about 50% from both the field and from 3 point range
4394,2020-08-19 23:15:54,icy23f,"We looked sluggish and careless AF. Stupid mistakes in the first half and players looked like they didn’t even care. We have earned nothing yet- we can’t play like it doesn’t matter and we def looked like we thought shit didn’t matter. I know we all think this, but i so desperately want to see some grit and fight from our players when shit gets tough. We can adjust our schemes and shift around starters, but if these guys aren’t going to dig deep and FIGHT for it, we’re never going to be real contenders. Really wishing they could be playing in front of fans right now to get that added umph"
4395,2020-08-20 01:07:13,icy23f,"Rewatched the first half and kinda felt better. Defense wasnt the best but wasnt as ass as it seemed. If anything, the offense fucked us at the end of the 2nd."
4396,2020-08-19 22:33:50,icy23f,Malone better get his shit in gear. Getting blown out by a less talented team in the playoffs is unacceptable.
4397,2020-08-20 03:49:06,icy23f,Rewatched the bad run and man did Jokic stand out like a sore thumb. His inability to guard the PnR was brutal today. He was bad when dropping and he was bad when playing up/hedging. Not a good sign because there's no real fix to his limitations. Jazz just kept taking advantage of it.
4398,2020-08-19 22:47:09,icy23f,"Alright boys that was literally a nightmare to watch. We got FUCKED. Now the nuggets as a team can take two paths: Malone and the players sit down and completely change the game plan by looking at the games footage and recognizing our mistake. Or Malone can fuck us over and change nothing, not even selecting Millsap. 

Malone, you can either make or break your career here. Choose wisely. 

Tough loss, hoping same shit doesnt happen twice."
4399,2020-08-19 22:50:03,icy23f,People still think Beal can save this team when our problems are clearly centered around defense
4400,2020-08-19 23:59:36,icy23f,Moach surprisingly level-headed in the post game
4401,2020-08-19 22:32:56,icy23f,"You can't blame this loss on abnormal 3pt shooting, the stupid doubles we sent at Mitchell gave them wide open looks all game.

Overreaction by Malone."
4402,2020-08-20 03:10:35,icy23f,Someone on the ringer pod mentioned a trade that would be Jamal and MPJ for Simmons. I can’t imagine the Nugs would ever do such a thing and I’d be pretty conflicted giving up even one of those guys for Simmons.
4403,2020-08-20 00:20:27,icy23f,"Malone is a subpar coach and this one is on him. I have 0 idea why would you change the plan after it worked in game 1. After game one, everyone, including jazz players themselves felt like whole team is useless garbage and mitchel is playing alone. Should have just kept doing the same shit they did in game 1. Its not like Donovan would get 70 or 80. More than likely he fails to repeat the performance from game 1 and the series is likely over.


What does Malone come up with? Lets double up mitchel, leave open shots to jazz scrubs so they can get their confidence and in the mean time kill any momentum the team had after everyone is demoralized seeing open 3s go in.


Every play off series denver got outcoached, imagine what would happen if they didnt tank for ""easy"" match ups and went against more talented teams? If you cant sweep this jazz team how are you going to play real contenders who have more talented teams?"
4404,2020-08-19 22:36:31,icy23f,This ones for the Will the Thrill deniers.  His injury is a killer!
4405,2020-08-19 22:36:46,icy23f,We’ll be alright. Friday is gonna be a big game though.
4406,2020-08-19 22:55:36,icy23f,I mean Nuggets played bad but they didn't play that bad to get blown out like this. It was Utah's game. They shot 50% from deep. It happens. They're not gonna repeat it. I still see Denver winning this one in 6
4407,2020-08-20 02:33:50,icy23f,"They were making tough shots and all there players showed up and had efficient games, I’m not worried."
4408,2020-08-19 22:34:33,icy23f,Good way to make a day shitty. Such is the life of a sport fan
4409,2020-08-19 22:36:28,icy23f,Seems like the issue was double mitchell. Instead of him somehow getting buckets we let the entire team warm up with wide open 3s. 1 super hot guy is better than 5 i guess. Seems like an easy fix at least.
4410,2020-08-19 23:12:06,icy23f,"While Mitchells shooting is REALLY hot when it comes to pull up 3s from the pnr,a lot of their shots were a product of good offense. Our pnr defense is garbage,and not from Jok or Jamal,both of them. Not to mention that we can't defend people from getting to the rim or drawing fouls.

Whats the weirdest thing,while GH is not playing and Gobert is the center,we defended the pnr against the Blazers last year completely fine. They definitely didn't have as many shooters,but my god,it feels like every defensive possesion we get killed.

Game was a bit concering,ngl. Though i think we bounce back,just not in the convincing fashion i thought the series was going to end."
4411,2020-08-19 23:39:01,icy23f,I mean I know in general they are a good 3p shooting team but at some of them they made and their shooting in general is something they’ll struggle to replicate in the next game. Hell they damn near shot 60% from the field in general.
4412,2020-08-20 02:08:46,icy23f,"Our shot selection should look like this 30% Jokić 30%MPJ 30%Jamal 4% Grant 4% Monte 2% everyone else, put Jok in hard carry mode, start Grant, let Spida get his, play harder on everyone else, if you cant play good defense at least be fisical and faul harder, let them feel us, and their role players will miss. Also when offense gets stagnant just let Jok or MPJ shoot over 17 people at once if anyone in this league can shoot over anyone at will, they can."
4413,2020-08-20 03:00:43,icy23f,"NBA should do more for teams with HCA, pretty annoying our advantage for having a better record has evaporated."
4414,2020-08-20 09:05:04,icy23f,"I think we need to improve all these things: 

3pt defence, more ball sharing (popping as Mares says), more effort plays in rebounding and hedging screens, less double teaming- it didn't work moach stop it.

Harris would help all of these, but realistically we can win by improving all of these things without him, because we saw it in the first game."
4415,2020-08-20 18:04:18,icy23f,David Locke is very very good. One of my favorite other team reporters to listen to. His series preview with Mares was excellent. I’ll give his locked on a listen today
4416,2020-08-19 22:50:10,icy23f,"I might be crazy but Jokic has been putting so much less effort on D and playing much less in the post ever since All Star games, i feel like if he gets his shit together then the others will also try harder on D as well."
4417,2020-08-19 23:21:44,icy23f,"\- Not sure why Malone adjusted the defense by doubling Mitchel, I know he had historic night, but they still lost. I guess it was let others beat us - and , oh boy, they did

\- I do not see how we win the series. Without Gary Harris (and to lesser degree Thrill) we have no perimeter defense. 

\- Jazz just played better, harder and smarter

\- The only positive for us were MPJ (scored in play-off, he can just rise above the defender and shoot) and Jokic (people will probably disagree, but I think that he never bullied Gobert 1-on-1 like he did today - he had better numbers, but this was without his shot going in like usual. Gobert will probably adjust and bother Jokic again next game, but if he does not, we may have some small window of opportunity there, for example getting Rudy in foul trouble early). 

\- No fans in the bubble is really good for shooting teams. I can see Rockets going all the way.  


I hope I am overreacting."
4418,2020-08-19 22:36:29,icy23f,"Lost by 20, defense looks terrible, Barton is out, no sign of Gary... the future looks grim. I don’t think we’d feel nearly as bad if we hadn’t almost lost the 1st game or if we would have looked better in the seeding games."
4419,2020-08-19 22:42:55,icy23f,"I love Milsap's energy on D, but I can't stand when he decides to do an ISO drive because he's somehow owed like 3-4 of those a game. Just go with the flow!"
4420,2020-08-19 23:04:19,icy23f,"I should have pledged to do something if some nuggets player has a bad game like I did last time.

Gotta make sacrifices to basketball gods."
4421,2020-08-19 22:34:38,icy23f,"Malone seemed absolutely beat down at the end of the seeding games by our defense.  There is absolutely no way we're making it out of this round, much less making it any further, unless we get this shit fixed."
4422,2020-08-19 23:56:48,icy23f,Best of 5
4423,2020-08-20 02:26:01,icy23f,"You are Tim Connelly. 

The 76ers call you this offseason and say hey, Horford could use a change of scenery. We will give you Horford and a 1st round pick for Harris & Barton. 

What do you say?"
4424,2020-08-20 01:18:15,icy23f,"Honestly when i see how many other teams have good / solid / great defenders uff. Darkness falls on my eyes. The only solution that emerges is Diop 20 minutes at 3 and Grant 35 minutes at 4. Unfortunately, Malone is not a progressive coach and who knows if he will change anything at all. A great man and a great motivator but Malone succumbs to pressure from fans and the public. Malone goes from one extreme to the other. From hard defensive to hard offensive. Here the fans are screaming ""why doesn't Porter take shots"" and MPJ has 30 fg and 20+ of them were heavy over raised hands. MPJ has contested shoots almost like everyone else put together. Gary and Barton are not some elite shooters but they moved much more and participated in the action, the flow of the ball. This ultra- talented boy (MPJ) should not be burned, because it will burn the whole team. It is not about percentages at all, but the recognizable style of play is disturbed. Millsap is old and we needs Grant to play on 4.....but Millsap has only taken 3-4 isolations for 2 games. It's nothing, and some here scream for those few iso situations, and little Porter takes 20+ heavy shots for God sake. He almost never passes the ball in 80% of cases looking only forward. Porter will one day be the elite, but currently Murray-Jokic have to solve this series against Utah, and the others have to adjust. We don't have time now for a new style of play. You need to go to safety. And next season, the MPJ-Jokic-Murray trio will play and surround them with a few good defenders. It would be stupid to drop out of a weaker team."

4433,2020-08-19 22:55:10,icy23f,Milsap has these tunnel-vision isos when he gets the ball and they must be like 40% TS efficiency shots. They're just terrible for our offensem
4434,2020-08-20 04:23:58,icy23f,love it. call up malone.
4435,2020-08-19 23:01:25,icy23f,Utah is the best three point shooting team in the bubble. Their guys hit open threes and we give up a lot of open threes. I'm not optimistic about them cooling off.
4436,2020-08-19 22:59:14,icy23f,"Much like the Nuggets 22 in game 1, that game still went to OT."
4437,2020-08-19 22:53:31,icy23f,These Nuggets managed to win road games against the Spurs and Blazers - both when they were down 2-1. If the Nuggets lose the next game it won't be the first time they're caught in a pretty bad spot in a series.. but hopefully they won't. I agree with you completely
4438,2020-08-19 23:28:11,icy23f,We did not take this game seriously at all. Saw all players not giving full effort. We really thought we could just show up and win.
4439,2020-08-19 22:51:19,icy23f,I just wish we got OKC. It wouldn't hurt as much struggling against them. But losing to the Jazz is the worst of the worst. I'd rather lose to the Lakers honestly.
4440,2020-08-20 00:27:30,icy23f,Lowkey I feel our best Mitchell defender in these two games is Murray.
4441,2020-08-20 01:38:03,icy23f,go get em Coach..i'm down with this
4442,2020-08-20 00:41:10,icy23f,im on board
4443,2020-08-20 14:53:55,icy23f,"As a Jazz fan this scares me, probably the right move. But I’m also all about Donovan not having to deal with Craig."
4444,2020-08-19 22:39:29,icy23f,Dude was making contested shots all game too. Imagine what he would do if we passed it to him when he's open.
4445,2020-08-19 23:54:11,icy23f,I didn't watch the end. Did we start defending shooters or did they just cool off?
4446,2020-08-19 22:49:38,icy23f,"And they’re right too, as much as that hurts to say"
4447,2020-08-19 23:08:15,icy23f,"Just one thing, dont worry about the two man game being figured out. Agree with the rest"
4448,2020-08-19 23:21:19,icy23f,"I don't know how many times I have to keep saying this, but...

MPJ is 3rd on the team in shots through 2 games. He is clearly the 3rd most utilized option, and through 3 quarters today was 2nd in shots. 

I'm aware that shots aren't necessarily indicative of involvement, but in these two games, his per 36 shot attempts have been close to 18fga. That's elite territory. I'm not sure how many more touches everyone wants him to get when his touches are already producing an elite FGA rate. Last game he would've put up 17ish shots in regulation had he not been benched for D. Today he was on about the same pace, and got to 17 shots despite playing less than he would've if it wasn't a blowout. 

We can get him more touches, but that likely means he'll be putting up as many or more shots as jokic, and he's a rookie with 10 starts. I think he's fine. 

I do agree with pretty much everything else you said though"
4449,2020-08-19 22:43:39,icy23f,Well said
4450,2020-08-19 23:56:50,icy23f,The avs are definitely on another level from the Nuggs right now but the coyotes are way way way worse than the jazz. This series is like if the Nuggs were playing the grizz or the suns in the first round. And the avs even lost one early in the series
4451,2020-08-19 22:41:44,icy23f,How do you expect Jokic to be + when he was in for the most part of the game and we got blown out
4452,2020-08-19 23:07:43,icy23f,We need Finch back
4453,2020-08-19 22:34:09,icy23f,"Losing game two in the first round isn’t Nugglife

4454,2020-08-19 22:41:04,icy23f,He was shooting well right before the shutdown
4455,2020-08-20 01:38:30,icy23f,haha always a silver lining
4456,2020-08-20 01:57:23,icy23f,As far as playoff teams I can say with confidence: At least we're not philly. I just don't see how Simmons and Embiid works out resulting in a championship and if they get rid of one of those guys those fans have to admit to themselves that years of sucking ass has resulted in nothing and the process was really just an excuse to keep the GM around longer than he deserved.
4457,2020-08-19 23:00:37,icy23f,My biggest fear right now is we take every series to 7 and never make it to the wcf but play just well enough for him to keep his job. I hope Malone can grow as much as these kids. first off he should be getting an assistant coach that can actually call plays out of timeouts.
4458,2020-08-19 23:19:41,icy23f,"I think we'll bounce back because we've seen them do it last year.   


My worry is that they have no idea how to step on their opponents throats. We can't take every series to game 7"
4459,2020-08-19 22:43:29,icy23f,"They really played well, but hopefully they don't play this well again for the rest of the series..."
4460,2020-08-19 23:23:23,icy23f,I guess for next game we should try going the Rockets way - attemot 60 3s or something. How much worse can it be?
4461,2020-08-19 23:37:49,icy23f,I think it's Adam Mares who points this out a lot but our offensive game plan is very predictable. Jokic and Murray two man game. That's pretty much it except when the bench unit is in it's Monte and Mason two man game. Defensively we're also pretty predictable: Crash hard in the paint on the PnR and live with guys getting open looks from three.
4462,2020-08-19 23:27:52,icy23f,Swap Grant for Craig. More offense on the floor and it's not like Craig's doing much on Mitchell this series anyway.
4463,2020-08-20 13:06:31,icy23f,scary thing is that he is still raw af...
4464,2020-08-19 22:46:00,icy23f,Lol that's rough
4465,2020-08-20 00:18:44,icy23f,"We don't need to trade for anything we just need Jamal to be a consistent game to game 20 ppg scorer. If that happens, we're a title contender. If it doesn't, then maybe we need to start talking about a trade, but the trade doesn't need to be for defense it needs to be for offense."
4466,2020-08-20 00:29:47,icy23f,"I think Mitchell is going to average 30+ no matter who guards him so we should use Craig to shut down one of their other dudes, probably Clarkson. That would also free up a spot in the starting lineup for a shooter so there aren't two guys who Utah literally just dares to shoot open threes out there at the same time."
4467,2020-08-20 00:20:25,icy23f,If Gobert is gonna guard Millsap we absolutely need to start Grant instead.
4468,2020-08-20 02:35:09,icy23f,"I had a feeling this was going to happen when I saw that annoying clip of Murray screaming ""FIFTY-SEVENNNNNNNNNNNNNN"" at Mitchell who was clearly trying to get some quiet downtime to himself."
4469,2020-08-19 22:50:50,icy23f,We still shit a decent percentage from 3
4470,2020-08-19 23:53:44,icy23f,Mitchell/Gobert is about as bad a matchup as possible for him now that Harden/Capela are gone. Only one tougher is probably Lebron/AD
4471,2020-08-20 12:06:06,icy23f,"Our coach prefers the ""hustling"" type of players instead of the offensive minded ones that shoot lights out... every team in the legue is looking for three point shooters, look what Mavs are doing, their defense is terrible, but they outscore everyone. Malone is too old school minded."
4472,2020-08-20 00:49:28,icy23f,Fingers crossed they lose by 25+ so we’re not the worst blowout today
4473,2020-08-20 00:53:25,icy23f,"Feel bad for my boy Thybulle, rest of that team not so much. 

Edit: I really wanted us to snag him. Bol is an acceptable consolation prize though."
4474,2020-08-20 02:15:31,icy23f,Gobert gets away with literally everything defensively. Jokic should be averaging 10 fts per game in this series
4475,2020-08-19 22:42:26,icy23f,His decline came at the worst time lol
4476,2020-08-19 22:45:27,icy23f,Yep hard decline coming into the bubble. Should be coming off the bench for the rest of the series.
4477,2020-08-19 22:41:55,icy23f,He can come back but on a much smaller contract (hopefully vet min) and coming off the bench as a role player. I think the dude's time is up... maybe Grant should start from now on (since he's getting more minutes nowadays anyways)
4478,2020-08-19 23:29:10,icy23f,He is always the slowest guy out there and he somehow has terrible hands. His defense is okay sometimes but he really doesn't bring much to the table.
4479,2020-08-19 22:56:13,icy23f,He had one close out that I swear he was going to bite on the fake but didn’t and forced the drive into a busy paint and a bad shot. I was hell of stoked to see that since he was soooooo green a couple days ago
4480,2020-08-19 22:52:56,icy23f,Why would Conley make life easier?
4481,2020-08-19 22:37:03,icy23f,"I mean we are missing Gary and Thrill, that surely makes a big difference on the defensive end."
4482,2020-08-19 23:07:23,icy23f,I would give him Craigs minutes if he continues to die on screens.
4483,2020-08-20 05:59:41,icy23f,"Millsap was actually pretty good defensively today. He's never going to have a major impact offensively. He's pretty much been phased out and one issue with the Nuggets offense is when the Murray/Jokic two man game isn't working, they don't have a backup plan with Barton being hurt and MPJ not being ready yet I guess?

Jokic dropping in the PnR allowed the Jazz to generate a ton of open looks. I think Mitchell hit 3 or 4 3s in the 3rd quarter alone when Jokic dropped. They're going to have to adjust again and give up some easy twos. They can't have Jokic dropping in the PnR anymore."
4484,2020-08-19 22:40:08,icy23f,"If you think this is a 5 game series, I’ve got bad news friend"
4485,2020-08-19 22:44:57,icy23f,only Malone knows why...he is thinking too much all the time and he can't see the things right before his nose
4486,2020-08-19 22:45:01,icy23f,"How so?

>Why tf would you change something that worked?

Lol we almost lost if it wasn't for an 8-second violation. Does giving up 57 'work'?"
4487,2020-08-19 23:37:38,icy23f,"The perimeter defense would improve, and the jazz are small, so we don't really need Millsap's post D. Grant should start"
4488,2020-08-19 22:50:35,icy23f,"There was one possession in the 4th quarter where Mitchell was open in the far corner and MPJ was attempting to contest. Mitchell slightly pump faked (literally raised his arms just a bit) and MPJ stopped completely in his tracks and waited for the ball to go up. 

Afterwards Mitchell actually shot it then made the three. Dude has to do better on defense, he's amazing on offense but there needs to be more effort on that end. He's KD on offense but nowhere near KD on defense. I honestly feel that he hunts for defensive rebounds too much and leaves players open but what do I know... it's probably a part of the scheme"
4489,2020-08-19 23:27:30,icy23f,"I think we have more talent without Bogdanovic and Conley, but they have better coaching. Every no-name guy looks like fitting in their system. Malone is great for chemistry, but these adjustments (maybe that is on the assistants?) and x-and-o stuff is not his strongest trait."
4490,2020-08-20 03:49:37,icy23f,The Jazz number is skewed because they shot 1-11 on their last 11 3s and like 7 of them were from their 8th stringers lol
4491,2020-08-20 03:33:32,icy23f,MPJ is the only guy on the team willing to be aggressive from behind the arc game to game. Meanwhile the Jazz had two guys take 9 threes and one take 7. They also had 10 more assists than we did. That's the L right there.
4492,2020-08-20 04:04:38,icy23f,"We had 27 attempts and they had 44!   In the bubble, forget about percentage, if you tell me that one team attempted 44 3s and another 27, there is a pretty good chance that first team won."
4493,2020-08-19 22:58:18,icy23f,"Royce O'Neal, Donovan Mitchell, Joe Ingles, and Jordan Clarkson shot somewhere north of 60% from three on high volume and that won the game."
4494,2020-08-19 22:54:30,icy23f,"Jazz have the too 3p shooting % in the bubble iirc, and were great in regular season too. I doubt them shooting well is an anomaly. Maybe this well, but I'm expecting more of the ssme."
4495,2020-08-19 23:10:52,icy23f,That was a cringy post by em honestly lmao
4496,2020-08-19 22:58:48,icy23f,Unfortunately not the first time the Nuggets social media interns have jinxed us
4497,2020-08-19 23:01:36,icy23f,Sauce?
4498,2020-08-19 22:37:07,icy23f,he legitimately did a great job on mitchell in the first half
4499,2020-08-19 22:39:06,icy23f,"Without him, there is no perimeter defense"
4500,2020-08-20 00:28:25,icy23f,"The Spurs shot [33.8%](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2019-nba-western-conference-first-round-spurs-vs-nuggets.html) from 3 in our series.

The Blazers shot [32.6%](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2019-nba-western-conference-semifinals-trail-blazers-vs-nuggets.html) from 3 in our series.

We had 2 Munders in each series.

You might be disappointed in the Nuggets, and you might especially be disappointed in how we didn't make it to the WCF last year, but describing the Spurs and Blazers series as unsustainable shooting that persisted for 7 games is just wrong.

Dame had a 52% True Shooting. he hit 28% of his threes on almost 10 a game.

This narrative is trivially verifiable and completely false."
4501,2020-08-20 00:08:53,icy23f,Yup. It's just how we play defense. We take away layups and rely on guys to miss open threes. It worked in game one and it didn't tonight.
4502,2020-08-20 04:07:15,icy23f,Wouldn't have mattered anyways. We just weren't good enough today. On to the next one.
4503,2020-08-19 22:38:24,icy23f,we say that every game lol...you forgot almost everyone shoots lights out against us
4504,2020-08-19 22:39:20,icy23f,The avs are really good and might win the cup this year.
4505,2020-08-19 22:40:12,icy23f,MPJ gets better every game.
4506,2020-08-19 22:38:39,icy23f,They shot out of their mind tonight & our two stars shit the bed. That’s what I keep telling myself at least lol.
4507,2020-08-19 22:42:11,icy23f,Jokic won’t miss that many bunnies and free throws to let the game get out of hand. Really sucked to see everyone put their heads down after that stretch of a bunch of offensive rebounds and no bucket.
4508,2020-08-19 22:51:36,icy23f,We don't know.
4509,2020-08-20 01:20:50,icy23f,Need to start grant at 4. If we keep staggering MPJ with the starters and bench that should leave enough scoring to not completely tank that unit.
4510,2020-08-19 22:54:13,icy23f,"Here is the thing, are they less talented?  Jokic is the obvious exception.  They clearly have a better backcourt...Mitchell is a legit superstar.

Don't get me wrong, I agree that Malone needs to figure it out.  But it strikes me as pretty stupid to call them less talented when one of their players has hung 87 on us over two games."
4511,2020-08-20 06:05:51,icy23f,160 defensive rating baby! Kill me
4512,2020-08-19 23:21:16,icy23f,Our problem is only having one guy who you can count on to show up and score every single night.
4513,2020-08-19 22:50:43,icy23f,Wasn't Beal a good defender at one point
4514,2020-08-19 23:34:57,icy23f,"Yeah, we need someone like Jevon Carter from Suns (I love players like that)."
4515,2020-08-20 00:08:14,icy23f,That makes me feel better. Gotta think he'll have the team ready for game 3.
4516,2020-08-19 22:37:04,icy23f,We had a better 3pt%.
4517,2020-08-20 04:15:55,icy23f,I'd do Jamal for Simmons straight up. Not with Mike. No way.
4518,2020-08-20 01:39:20,icy23f,Malone really lost us the game by missing close shots & free throws he'd usually make and defending at a low level. No wonder he was so meek in the post game
4519,2020-08-20 08:23:41,icy23f,Sweeping the Jazz was never going to happen. They have playoff experience.
4520,2020-08-20 02:53:44,icy23f,"Their guys just hit open shots that they missed in game one. If they hit those shots we lose, if they miss them we win. That's what it's going to come down to"
4521,2020-08-20 02:44:36,icy23f,[removed]
4522,2020-08-20 02:37:50,icy23f,If MPJ played starter minutes I think his defense would offset whatever offense presence he would bring. Every time hes on the floor they just pick n roll til they expose him
4523,2020-08-19 23:09:52,icy23f,Because he gets doubled every time he posts up
4524,2020-08-19 23:25:19,icy23f,"Coming in as a jazz fan, I think you are overreacting. The jazz commentators were talking about how this was the 2nd best game the jazz have played all year. The jazz shot incredible like the nuggets did in game 1. Both unsustainable.  Should be a great series!"
4525,2020-08-19 22:44:08,icy23f,"He's slow/late on rotations on D now, he's just old. Grant should be starting."
4526,2020-08-20 02:33:40,icy23f,I dont like that
4527,2020-08-20 02:30:15,icy23f,no takebacksies
4528,2020-08-20 03:04:14,icy23f,I would prefer Aldridge. He has a scorers mentality. Not sure on salaries but I think he would work so well next to Jokic.
4529,2020-08-20 02:15:55,icy23f,"Succumbs to pressure from fans and public? What? I think Malone has his flaws, but that sure as fuck ain't one of them."
4530,2020-08-20 02:18:08,icy23f,"He took barton out of the starting lineup two games into the playoffs last year. I hope he realizes Millsap is just not giving us nearly enough to warrant a start moving forward.   


Honestly though our problem is scheme more than any individual defender. We need to stop leaving guys open from three and we need to focus on shutting down Ingles and Clarkson instead of tripling Mitchell."
4531,2020-08-19 22:36:10,icy23f,Bol's not in the playoff rotation
4532,2020-08-20 20:29:53,icy23f,Give me AD any day of the week. He would instantly fix so many of our problems as well as magnifying the Lakers’ problems if he left. Double win.
4533,2020-08-20 13:43:06,icy23f,"Lol no shit. You could just say Jokić would fit perfectly on Dallas, but we don't want that."
4534,2020-08-19 22:42:58,icy23f,Jfc
4535,2020-08-20 14:01:57,icy23f,disagree. he can average 40 as long as we play defense on the rest of the Jazz.
4536,2020-08-20 15:42:02,icy23f,"Bol does not have the footwork to do that, He can block shots but he's horrific on defense otherwise."
4537,2020-08-19 22:36:06,icy23f,Fuck you
4538,2020-08-19 23:05:25,icy23f,"And they are not remotely scared of our defence. And if talking heads are to be believed, shooting is easier in the bubble.

I'd be more surprised if they don't keep shooting well."
4539,2020-08-19 23:04:04,icy23f,"How many of these threes Mitchell hit were wide open?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMF9kaf7V8U"
4540,2020-08-19 23:00:28,icy23f,"Because Donovan Mitchell had an all time great playoff performance

Also the Nuggets hit a significant fraction of those threes in OT"
4541,2020-08-19 23:06:02,icy23f,That 2010 series still haunts me. Jazz fans definitely rival Lakers fans for worst in the league.
4542,2020-08-20 01:07:38,icy23f,"I thought he did ok, but I also don't think it matters, because if Mitchel goes for even 40, but Ingles goes for 12, Clarkson goes for 16 and Oneal goes for 4, this is a completely different game."
4543,2020-08-20 03:07:14,icy23f,"Might be the case, but we need his shot creation more than his defense, if someone else can look after that end of the ball he can keep attacking."
4544,2020-08-20 15:12:12,icy23f,"It's not going to happen. At most Malone will move Millsap to the bench, but he's such a stubborn coach when it comes to defense that he's going to continue to try to limit Mitchell even if it means y'all get 50 open threes per game."
4545,2020-08-20 00:01:28,icy23f,"They cooled off. I didn’t think the three point defense today was worse than on Monday. Utah just went inferno.

That being said, the three point defense has still been subpar both games."
4546,2020-08-20 00:01:34,icy23f,Their end of the bench guys could not hit.
4547,2020-08-19 22:55:35,icy23f,Careful you are only allowed to talk like that around here after a loss. After a win we are Finals contenders apparently.
4548,2020-08-20 14:36:58,icy23f,You're not. I'm a jazz fan and you guys are fuckin solid
4549,2020-08-19 22:56:21,icy23f,"I don't. Was just highlighting what a poor game some of our big players had. Joker was poor today. Was trying too hard, not letting the game come to him and we all know that's not a good idea. Same was true of Jamal. We are not a iso heavy team. Recipe for disaster."
4550,2020-08-19 22:49:42,icy23f,"Nah man, he was bad for his standards. In both games."
4551,2020-08-19 23:10:46,icy23f,"Strong agree, I think we really miss him. Need someone who can fill that void"
4552,2020-08-20 12:17:04,icy23f,Agree!
4553,2020-08-19 22:36:46,icy23f,Gallo getting hurt 2 weeks before the playoffs is nugglife.
4554,2020-08-19 22:38:50,icy23f,"For me, it's more about the injuries. With will and gary out, we lose not only them as players, but alot of our playoff experience from last year. This was supposed to be the year we came back and used all the lessons we learned in the playoffs last year. 

But by replacing will and thrill with MPJ and Dozier (as well as basically Millsap with Grant), half of our main players weren't here last year and it's like we have to go through all those first year playoff struggles all over again."
4555,2020-08-20 03:00:22,icy23f,They really fucked it all up when they drafted markelle fultz and then traded him away but I can't blame them. He was the consensus number one pick.
4556,2020-08-19 23:35:59,icy23f,"We shot a better percentage than the jazz on threes, so that's not a terrible idea."
4557,2020-08-19 23:41:11,icy23f,Only if they show signs of having a hot hand like they did tonight. I don’t think this team has to live and die by the 3 every game.
4558,2020-08-19 23:43:03,icy23f,Our twin towers lineup of Bol Bol and Mason almost beat the lakers. Why not just give Bol periodic minutes with mason and see what happens? Is Bol going to give you any less production than someone like Dozier?
4559,2020-08-19 23:51:59,icy23f,"Naw, it would have to be Morris or PJ. Having two guards on the floor would be better then 3 forwards."
4560,2020-08-20 01:47:58,icy23f,jamal will always be 36 14 30 16 28 17 25 11 kinda guy
4561,2020-08-20 00:14:02,icy23f,"Ya, dunno why anyone would think this would be an easy series. Any strong PnR, drive/kick offence is gonna kill us"
4562,2020-08-20 02:39:20,icy23f,member when the sub celebrated the “easy“matchup a week ago ? i member
4563,2020-08-20 00:54:14,icy23f,PLEAASSSSSEEEEEEE
4564,2020-08-20 00:54:05,icy23f,yeah. I love me some Mattise.... Wish we had him
4565,2020-08-19 22:59:40,icy23f,In a way it's like we are down 3 starters in the playoffs.
4566,2020-08-19 22:58:09,icy23f,Yeah man it’s those little things I noticed in this game that makes me think he can stay on the floor in tight games. Still a long way to go but that play specifically made me irrationally happy
4567,2020-08-19 22:53:56,icy23f,"Mitchell’s usage goes down. Their spacing gets more congested. Outside of the small sample size of him shooting decently in the bubble, he has not been a great fit for Utah."
4568,2020-08-23 17:52:56,icy23f,:D
4569,2020-08-19 22:51:36,icy23f,yea that guy is a dummy .. nugs in 4
4570,2020-08-19 22:48:43,icy23f,GET OUT OF MY SUB! I NEED A MOD!!
4571,2020-08-19 22:48:42,icy23f,"So what you’re suggesting is that Mitchell is gonna go for 57 or more again, Highly unlikely. Yes if it took Mitchell going for 57 to win it was a very successful game plan. Like I know you’re a massive homer who will defend Malone to the death but miss me with that.  His game plan was terrible and his insistence to double down on said gameplay at halftime  and come out to give up 43 points in the third was even worse."
4572,2020-08-19 23:09:11,icy23f,There's just too many offensive oriented players playing at the same time as we don't have Gary to help balance things out. Whole roster is just offensive players imo. If we could get our hands on on some 3&D players(Unlikely) that would change everything.
4573,2020-08-19 23:35:23,icy23f,That's exactly how you're supposed to play a pump fake tho
4574,2020-08-20 03:50:19,icy23f,The Jazz play 2020 offense. The Nuggets play 1994 offense.
4575,2020-08-20 03:57:07,icy23f,I never feel bad about a single shot that MPJ takes. Even contested 3s that don’t go in I feel damn good about those. When I see TC take a 3 where the entire defense is running away from him my ass hole tightens immensely. That’s my take
4576,2020-08-19 22:59:16,icy23f,Who knew Jordan fucking Clarkson could be a problem smh
4577,2020-08-19 23:23:27,icy23f,At one point the jazz outside niang and Morgan were over 70%from 3. Yikes
4578,2020-08-19 22:55:37,icy23f,"It is an anomaly. They were 18/33 when I checked midway through the fourth

That's like, better than peak GSW ever did. 

This is anomaly."
4579,2020-08-20 00:01:19,icy23f,"if you're honestly expecting them to keep shooting above 55% from 3, why even bother watching the series? that's literally unbeatable and would be a historically unprecedented playoff shooting performance"
4580,2020-08-19 22:48:52,icy23f,"There isn't perimeter defense with him anyway lol.

Look he's a hustle player but that's all he is. He is not a lockdown defender that Harris is."
4581,2020-08-19 22:40:34,icy23f,I did almost forget lol
4582,2020-08-19 23:17:47,icy23f,"I mean jokic is the best player on the court and I would still take him over Donovan. Gobert and Jamal are about even, and grant and mpj are better than jingles and Clarkson. Not to mention we still have the corpse of milsap and monte Morris who are both pretty good as well."
4583,2020-08-19 22:52:41,icy23f,I don't think he has ever been considered good on defense
4584,2020-08-20 00:12:40,icy23f,i have complete faith in the entire team and coaching staff for game 3
4585,2020-08-19 22:45:13,icy23f,Only because of garbage time
4586,2020-08-19 22:48:20,icy23f,Jazz had 55% until they put their garbage time players in
4587,2020-08-20 05:19:57,icy23f,[deleted]
4588,2020-08-20 02:31:26,icy23f,"Nah dude he is great. Playing to lose seeding matches, always getting outsmarted vs other coaches. Im sure the players suggested the double team mitchel strat"
4589,2020-08-20 02:56:36,icy23f,What's worrying me is that they missed all of their shots in game 1 and we barely won. We really need harris right now goddamn
4590,2020-08-20 05:23:46,icy23f,Fuck off
4591,2020-08-20 02:49:59,icy23f,"but what else van we do, nobody else is even close to him in terms of scoring at will except Jokić, and we don't play good defense either way, I would literally put 90% of shots in him jok and jamal, everyone else except a bit of Monte and Grant I don't have any absolutely any confidence to score even a lay up."
4592,2020-08-19 23:12:25,icy23f,Just imagine if he had consistent 3pt shooters to pass to oh well...
4593,2020-08-20 00:22:47,icy23f,"I think we we will win one more at least, but our scheme was such that we get more rebounds and allow some 3-pt shots especially in the corners. we lost our two best perimeter defenders and bubble is great for shooters, especially for non-superstars. Jazz actually increased 3-pt shots, so I think it is the perfect storm. We were beating you, but I can only remember one easy game (when Plumdog hit a 3, lol, impossible to lose that one).  Thanks for the support!"
4594,2020-08-19 23:27:25,icy23f,Our defensive scheme continues to leave shooters wide open in the most efficient shooting spot on the floor. It's just bad defense.
4595,2020-08-20 02:40:33,icy23f,I probably say no as well. It’s just a conversation I could see happening
4596,2020-08-20 02:32:18,icy23f,In typical Tim fashion
4597,2020-08-20 06:05:57,icy23f,"Our 2 players from the starting lineup MPJ and Millsap have only 1 assist in 114 minutes for these 2 games at 45 fg. They stop the attack, the flow, they stiffen the game, they very rarely pass the ball, with their game like that we don't have the flow of the ball. This extremely affects the flow rate and makes it difficult for Murray / Jokic to take action. Mason is useless, 2 points for 2 games. Just look at Marjanovic from Dallas- 13 points for 9 mins against Clippers. Our back up center is the worst in the league in the Play Off. Vonleh should play instead of Mason. He even has a shooting. Diop and Troy should play. Well and Bol Bol 6-7 minutes. Malone will kill us with old merits with Millsap and Mason. And Porter can't play for more than 20 minutes because we don't have flow (20+ heavy shots, he doesn't want to pass) i like him a lot but he is still not ready for 30- 35 mins in the Play Off games."

4599,2020-08-20 14:46:41,icy23f,If he keeps shooting like this he won’t need his teammates!!
4600,2020-08-20 15:51:04,icy23f,Even in a zone defense ?
4601,2020-08-19 22:40:31,icy23f,Lmao. What a cornball. Why even post that here
4602,2020-08-19 23:09:31,icy23f,"I totally buy that they will keep shooting well (and I think Murray and MPJ will, for the same reason).

But 50+% on high volume? Y'all really think Utah is going to be the best three point shooting team in the game's history?"
4603,2020-08-19 23:08:24,icy23f,"And home teams have shot the ball better than road teams for some reason in the bubble, so I honestly expect them to get hotter"
4604,2020-08-19 23:09:33,icy23f,"I don't care about mitchell's threes. He's going to get his and we have to live with it. How many of Ingles threes were wide open? How many of Clarkson's? How many of O'Neals? How many of everyone elses? 

It is a cold hard fact that we flood the paint on defense and leave corner threes wide open. It's just what we do."
4605,2020-08-19 23:02:55,icy23f,"True, two top ten 3pt shots made in playoffs the past two games. Nuggets ranked 7th game one Jazz ranked 10th today. Can’t expect anything close to this to continue the rest of the series."
4606,2020-08-20 14:36:14,icy23f,:( I love you guys too
4607,2020-08-20 00:06:53,icy23f,I did not realize how bad the Jazz shot from three in game one.
4608,2020-08-19 22:56:40,icy23f,"Surely no-one actually thinks we can beat the clippers, right?"
4609,2020-08-19 22:54:50,icy23f,"Was he really? Defensively maybe, but I can definitely see the determination and leadership he put on the offensive side. But its dumb to comment a single player, the entire team was garbage tonight. Especially Craig. The boy was running around the game for 30 minutes doing absolute jackshit. Good shooting night from Jazz, but if we can't manage to stop Mitchell and their wide open threes I see this being a very difficult series. And one thing, Gary Harris is a gem of the Denver Nuggets."
4610,2020-08-19 22:42:42,icy23f,The referee inexplicably throwing a jump ball to the other team in triple overtime in a critical game 3 is Nugglife
4611,2020-08-19 22:46:26,icy23f,"Also, you could make the argument that if Gallo doesn’t get hurt the Warriors dynasty never happens"
4612,2020-08-20 03:03:46,icy23f,"Yeah I can't blame them for that. I also just don't think they've done a good job building a team around Simmons and Embiid. Tobias Harris is not worth a max contract and he's proving it in these playoffs, they don't have anyone besides simmons who can consistently make a post entry pass, and Horford on that team makes no sense to me at all"
4613,2020-08-19 23:46:28,icy23f,This jazz team would beat the Lakers in 5

4615,2020-08-20 02:41:07,icy23f,So he’s a guy that averages 22.5?
4616,2020-08-20 01:49:19,icy23f,"I disagree. He's gotten better every year, so there's no reason he can't put it all together and become consistent."
4617,2020-08-19 23:13:05,icy23f,Yeah. He’s just not a plus player so far
4618,2020-08-19 23:03:42,icy23f,"On the plus side, this series just got a lot longer haha. Hopefully we don’t lose too much in the process."
4619,2020-08-19 23:27:45,icy23f,"He may not give us what we need there this year, but if he can continue to develop there, we'll look real nice"
4620,2020-08-19 23:04:29,icy23f,"Idk man my confidence after looking at that game went way down. I know its just one loss out of so many wins against them, but damn when I turned on my television, I did not expect to see that. We were literally down 32 points with our starters playing by 3rd quarter. 

Hopefully our team got the message and they'll focus up next game. We have the talent, but missing the mentality. Malone has to step it up, start playing MPJ more and giving him more pos, stop change millsap for grant, and teach these guys to focus on def the 3 pts. We left them open so many times, so many mistakes. Humble up and we'll win this series."
4621,2020-08-20 15:03:50,icy23f,">	Their spacing gets more congested.

Conley is like a top five catch and shoot 3 dude in the league. I think it only serves to increase spacing, especially when he’ll take over all Mudiay minutes.

Also for about 10-15 games before shut down Conley was 17/4/5 something like 46/44 shooting, we’ve figured out the Conley fit it would seem."

4624,2020-08-20 03:14:56,icy23f,I explained it in a terrible way. I’d link you the play but I can’t find it anywhere. MPJ didn’t even contest the shot - no hands up or anything. Kinda stopped in front of Mitchell a bit farther out than a player trying to contest should.
4625,2020-08-20 13:59:30,icy23f,It's unfortunate because when Finch was here the Nuggets played 2036 offense

4628,2020-08-19 22:59:54,icy23f,"Our fault though, we gave them lots of open 3s."
4629,2020-08-19 23:02:34,icy23f,It's not an anomaly if they've been doing it for 10 straight games.
4630,2020-08-19 23:25:53,icy23f,Yeah but 15/33 would still be over 45% and would still be blowing us out. Just a 22 point lead instead of a 31 point lead
4631,2020-08-19 22:56:59,icy23f,"Well yeah, obviously, but we ain't got Gary, and the team is really bad defensively, so Craig is a must"

4635,2020-08-20 02:48:51,icy23f,Would you rather be playing the mavs right now??? I wasnt to thrilled about giving away games either but better than playing luka rd 1. Secondly the guy had 57 obviously you change something. Win or lose if a guy cooks you for 57 in an nba playoff game every coach in the history of the game would make an adjustment the following game
4636,2020-08-20 02:33:15,icy23f,and if it worked nobody would be praising anyone but the players for their effort. typical firemaloner
4637,2020-08-20 03:01:33,icy23f,"Mitchell isn't scoring 57 again. If we limit their role players by changing our defensive scheme, we'll be fine."
4638,2020-08-20 02:53:36,icy23f,I feel. I'm not saying sit him the whole time or anything. Honestly letting him lead the bench units offense may be worth a shot. But that may take away from his offensive chemistry with the 1s. Shew we need harris back lol
4639,2020-08-20 03:00:06,icy23f,"Why would you say no?   


I say yes, because this is two straight seasons of injury problems limiting both players' seasons, and I feel like the rest of the league views Gary as a negative asset at this point. To get a pick in return is as good as we can hope for in any deal where Gary is a main piece going out.  


The only reason I hesitate for even a second is Horford's contract, but he's better than Millsap and it's not like we're going to be able to sign anyone better than Horford in the off season anyway. If Grant gets super paid by someone else this off season at least we know we have a starting calliber 4 on the team with this deal."
4640,2020-08-20 13:58:43,icy23f,"The MPJ situation is way different than Millsap, because MPJ's job is to cut and make layups or stand in the corner and make threes. He had a rough game one, but came back and excelled at his job in game 2. He can pass, we've seen him make beautiful assists, but that's not what he's out there to do. The offense is supposed to end when he gets the ball, because when he gets the ball he should either be open for a 3 or open for a layup. 

Millsap's job (on offense) is to get iso buckets on the block and hit corner threes and he's not doing either of things."
4641,2020-08-20 15:58:09,icy23f,Probably also lots of ball movement beats a zone defense which the Jazz are really good at.
4642,2020-08-19 23:25:04,icy23f,"If it happened to anyone, it'd be the Nuggets. But no, not necessarily as good as today. But I still expect them to shoot well from 3 all series."
4643,2020-08-19 23:11:37,icy23f,"You should care about Mitchell's threes. He went 6/7. If he goes 2/7 instead maybe the Nuggets stay in the game a little bit longer and don't quit by the fourth quarter.

I agree that we give up threes as part of our PnR defense, and I agree that this is systemically a weakness vs. the Jazz. 

But they hit a higher percentage tonight than they will for the rest of the series. I feel pretty comfortable saying tonight was an aberration."
4644,2020-08-20 00:12:28,icy23f,They did. But they were missing open ones - like that ones possession where they kept getting the rebound and Niang missed like 3 wide open ones.
4645,2020-08-19 23:50:13,icy23f,"Jazz fan here, I think either of us could beat the Clippers as long as we don't destroy each other in the process in this first round. LAC hasn't looked very impressive to me, they were a bad technical call on KP away from potentially losing it.

We'll see how tonight goes for them, I think Dallas snags this one tonight"
4646,2020-08-19 23:16:53,icy23f,"He missed too many shots. It was very strange. He was at his best only in the first quarter.  

But I agree with you, everyone played bad."

4650,2020-08-20 02:44:33,icy23f,"exactly, and I'm a firm believer that at his best he is a 23 4 6 guy but always scoring like that, he never showed that he can score more evenly distributed, he is hot cold hot cold kinda guy I just feel that's how he plays."
4651,2020-08-20 01:52:50,icy23f,still not sure
4652,2020-08-19 23:11:49,icy23f,"It's hard not to get discouraged after a total ass kicking for sure. They were 19-32 from three at one point...a product of luck and our high double on Mitchell, which generated a ton of open threes. I think we need to let TC man up on Mitchell because Utah is the best 3pt shooting team in the NBA this year. Played right into their hands. MPJ got a healthy amount of minutes I thought, I'm not sure how much more we can play him. I agree that Grant needs more minutes. We need to rethink our perimeter strategy...I just don't really know how, since it's been so bad in the bubble."
4653,2020-08-20 15:11:15,icy23f,You take out the last 5 weeks of his play and he’s nowhere near that. I think his 3% went up 4% in that span at least. Was essentially going to be benched in late February if the story hadn’t leaked. I’m not sold on him making their team much better. Regular season doesn’t speak to that
4654,2020-08-20 15:32:16,icy23f,"I filtered for attempts and for the regular season, Millsap was 46% on catch and shoots. Insane. Ingles 44.8%. Conley is tied with Ingram and Kemba. Low 40s. Still great percentage. Hope I’m right for our sake  lol"
4655,2020-08-19 22:54:23,icy23f,I mean when you’re fighting hard and giving up three after three because of a shit game plan you’re gonna stop trying. Like you saw in the third quarter. It got to the point where the jazz got so hot they couldn’t miss anything open or not. And the nuggets stopped trying. Or in other words were  demoralized. This doesn’t happen is Malone has a competent game plan that doesn’t give up open three after open three.
4656,2020-08-20 03:17:21,icy23f,Ah ok I get ya. He was better on closeouts today so that's why I was confused. Thanks for the update
4657,2020-08-20 15:43:25,icy23f,Because Malone is the second coming of Mark Jackson and we need a Steve Kerr.
4658,2020-08-20 19:06:07,icy23f,Because we don't have a guard that can get into the paint and teams take away backdoor cuts in the playoffs.

4661,2020-08-20 10:25:01,icy23f,Literally praised malone after taking out mpj last game as that was a game winning move but ok.

4663,2020-08-20 03:13:37,icy23f,"I just think Horfords contract is so completely bad that it necessitates more coming back to Denver, especially since Philly is getting a competent player back in Barton.

4664,2020-08-19 23:17:11,icy23f,I can live with Mitchell hitting 6/7 threes if he's well defended. I can't handle Joe Ingles hitting 4-9 when they're all wide open. I can't handle Royce Oneal hitting 3/4 when every attempt is wide open. I can't handle Jordan Clarkson going 4-9 when half are wide open. It's unacceptable and they are going to continue to hit open threes.

4679,2020-08-19 23:19:04,icy23f,"I think you're right -- there's some process stuff to be concerned about here. We play a defensive scheme that gives a lot of free looks to shooters. Tonight they hit them, and I agree with you that next game, they'll hit them too. This is definitely a baseline problem with our defense.

But when the other team's lead playmaker shoots 6/7 on almost entirely pullup shots...you just usually lose those games."

4684,2020-08-20 18:01:50,icy23f,"He probably knows how to navigate the site better than me, and Conley shoots almost 3 catch and shoots a game, so he may have had a different cut off for who he was comparing Conley to. Don’t get me wrong— I love Conley and thought he would be playing like he has been most recently for the whole year— but the body of work he put in this season doesn’t totally speak to that. We will see if he plays Friday. I’d also like to see Mitchell’s usage numbers with and without Conley. Regardless, it won’t matter if Denver overcommits on the hedge with Mitchell for the rest of the series. Spacing won’t be an issue for Utah then."
4685,2020-08-19 23:00:49,icy23f,"The other team couldn’t miss, because Malone allowed them to get into a rhythm by givingb them uncontested look after uncontested look. In a bubble environment where it’s been common knowledge that shooters will get hot. Again Malone’s game plan left them demoralized."
4686,2020-08-19 23:26:29,icy23f,"If you cut the other guys that I listed from 11 made threes to 6 made threes, it's a four point game.   


We have to be ok living with Mitchell going off. If he's going to hit 6 contested threes, there's literally  nothing we can do about it. We can do something about leaving everyone else wide open every time someone gets the ball in the paint.   


If we keep playing defense like that Mitchell is going to continue to hit tough shots anyway."
4687,2020-08-20 04:21:37,icy23f,And Ingles is his daddy so that’s more reason to be less scared.
4688,2020-08-23 17:51:22,icy23f,"Aaaahahaha but you were right about the actual numbers! Locke mentioned the Conley shooting again (often does) and the parameters were OPEN catch and shoot opportunities, and it was also referencing 18-19 rather than this season. 

But yeah if he plays like that he may as well be the best catch and shoot guy in history"
4689,2020-08-19 23:29:28,icy23f,"> If you cut the other guys that I listed from 11 made threes to 6 made threes, it's a four point game.

Maybe? Maybe the Jazz get layups instead -- the reason guys were open is we sold harder on the ball handler and roll guy to stop the rim. Maybe they get 2 pts instead of 3 on a few of them.

> We have to be ok living with Mitchell going off. If he's going to hit 6 contested threes, there's literally nothing we can do about it. 

Strong agree-- which is the main reason I am shrugging this off as an unsustainable shooting night.

> We can do something about leaving everyone else wide open every time someone gets the ball in the paint.

Yes today Malone seemed to sell out really hard on ""don't let Mitchell beat us"" and everyone else beat us instead -- and it builds on our generally flimsy and weak PnR strategy of letting shooters shoot. Maybe it works when we have HCA in Denver and guys are tired, but here in the bubble shooters seem to be wayyyy better and our PnR defense is a liability.

I think we mostly agree -- I just try not to get too beaten up when the game is over midway through the third if it's on the backs of guys that can't miss."
4690,2020-08-19 23:35:18,icy23f,Packing the paint to prevent layups has been our strategy all year and we leave corner shooters open all game every game. I'm just worried that the jazz are going to continue to hit open shots and the series is going to go Jazz in 6 instead of nuggets in 6
4691,2020-08-19 23:36:43,icy23f,"Yeah. I think our strategy worked better when we played games in Denver and had the altitude advantage. I think shooters weren't always on their game when they came to town.

But in the bubble it seems like shooters are as good as they've ever been -- everyone seems to be lights out from MPJ to Donovan Mitchell to Booker to Lillard. 

I have the same fears about our defense (and also think it can be generalized to playing vs. the rockets)"

I've wanted to write about this.

Yes, there was bloodshed in the Civil War. Buckets of it, but how does that mean I need to credit JS for predicting a war, when in the very same prophecy, pestilence, hail, famine and earthquake are also part of the big bad thing that will happen? Unless you're asserting that the Civil War was step one in god's master plan of 'sweeping' evil people off the earth, I don't understand why JS needs to be given credit for predicting a bloody conflict. 

Predicting unprecedented bloodshed in the future is a pretty safe bet when it comes to humans on planet Earth. War was not a foreign concept when JS issued his prophecies."

I think there were several forces at work.  I know that CoC historians really pushed for the JS project.   

Another thing was that a lot of the JS papers are out there in the wild already.  Sometimes it is the actual text, and sometimes it is someone writing about something they saw, but the original source isn't available.  Sometimes what people said about documents is worse than what the documents actually say.  It is hard for apologists to work with hostile accounts of documents other than to denounce them as hostile.   Getting the papers out there at least takes away the idea that the church is hiding the papers and leads to speculation that there is even worse material in the archives.  Publishing all the papers instead of just publishing selected papers takes away the suspicion that they are hiding something in the vaults.

Another factor may have been lawsuits.  Under some European laws the church could be sued for false advertising if they cover up facts that they have available.  Publishing all of the papers gives them a defense that the information is available for anyone who wants to research it.

Edit: I think another factor is the church leadership knows they are eventually going to have to revise the official church history.  It seems their favorite diversion is ""we have always taught that.""  We saw it with things like the release of the seer stone.  A decade from now the JSP project will be handy because they can point to it as evidence that they never tried to hide anything."

4731,2020-08-19 22:22:27,icwelw,"To me, the question is simple: 

**What TE being drafted outside the top 8 has a chance for 100 targets?**

In 2018, Mark Andrews had 50 targets...in 2019, he had 98. 

Until 2018, Darren Waller  had 29 career targets...in 2019, he had 117. 

In 2017, George Kittle had 63 targets. In 2018, he had 136. 

So, how does a guy get target growth? Vacated Targets. 

The Ravens had 181 vacated targets last year. Mark Andrews blew up. 

The Buccaneers had 182. Chris Godwin blew up. 

Jared Cook left Oakland, leaving 101 TE targets wide open. Waller blew up. 

**ANSWER**  

Blake Jarwin. Going as TE19. The Cowboys have a ton of vacated targets (including 83 vacated Witten targets).  Witten was TE11 last year. Witten and Jarwin combined saw 124 targets. The path to him getting 100 of those this year is very clear.

Option 2: 

The Colts will throw the ball a lot more this year, and we know for a fact that Philip Rivers loves his TEs. Jack Doyle was PPR TE5 on a per-game basis in 2017 when he had 100 targets. He is going as TE18. 

Over an 11-year span from 2006-2016, Philip Rivers targeted Antonio Gates an average of 107 times per 16 games. 

Last year, Hunter Henry had a 16-game pace of 101 targets. 

In 2017, Hunter Henry+Antonio Gates got 114 targets. 

The Colts' pass catchers are not trustworthy outside of oft-injured TY Hilton. Their RBs aren't dynamo check-down options either. Doyle's gonna get fed."

I'd argue Hayden Hurst in 2020 has more in common with Mark Andrews in 2019 than Jonnu in 2020. Same with Gesiki.

Also, the sample size for Jonnu's YPC in that graphic is DRASTICALLY lower than George Kittle's.  You could do the same thing with Steph Curry and Joe Harris' career 3PT% and people would laugh at you for suggesting Joe Harris has similar generational 3PT shooting abilities.

FWIW; I like Jonnu as a late round TE pick. But I see potential closer to what Andrew's had in 2019 in guys like Hurst. Hurst is going in the same rounds Andrews was at the back end of last draft season. I'll flip a coin with Jonnu + Jarwin though."

For a TE2, that 8 game record is pretty darn impressive, especially when you consider it's nearly double what Goedert got from the first 8 games. Philly have started seeing something in his receiving , and this year is the one he jumps from being their TE2, to almost a TE1b to Ertz' TE1a"

Fant

Hurst

Gesicki

Irv Smith

Goedert - especially if Ertz misses time

These two have the best chance imo of finishing top 3-4 and giving the big names a run for their money.

If you want late-late, like undrafted in 14 team leagues, it's Ian Thomas, or Dallas Goedert should Ertz gets hurt. Goedert has a top 3 ceiling as well, assuming Ertz is out of the picture, while Thomas is more like top 8 guy, but you got him for peanuts and he still scored way more points than Tyler Higbee or whoever was taken in rounds 5 or 6."

4764,2020-08-20 20:01:08,icwelw,"While your point is well made, I think you’ve got to at least mention that the competition for targets in those offenses (Bal, Oak, and SF) was not what it will be in Dallas. Cooper was injured for a bulk of last season, so I think it’s reasonable to assume he sees an uptick. Gallup established himself as Cooper’s 1b if not better so could also command more targets with a more evenly spread offense. And Lamb is a highly touted first round talent who might take some time to acclimate, but will almost certainly be getting a healthy slice of the pie later in the season. I don’t see how Jarwin delivers value as the fifth read in the offense."

4793,2020-08-20 00:49:44,icwelw,"I sure hope so, because the league that I did that in is my primary league and the biggest buy in I've ever done at 500 dollars lol.  I loved my team until today when I found out that Miles Sanders has a nagging injury and Dalvin Cook is sending out mixed signals in his contract dispute."
4794,2020-08-20 15:06:52,icwelw,"Disagree in this context. I really disagree in general, but that's a longer topic - I'll just say if you can tell me right now how these murky situations are absolutely 100% for sure going to turn out - DM me asap please, we're going to Vegas to make a lot of $cash$money$ !!

But specific to this issue, TE in particular needs a bit of talent to create their situation - we know TE's take longer to break out because it's a lot more to absorb, you have to learn 2 positions at once, etc. A lot of TE's can't run routes at the same level.  Watch Kittle sell his routes - ""if it were easy everyone would do it.""  Also it's much harder to break out when they're on the sideline for a better blocker.  It \*can\* happen (see Andrews last year) but that's likely more outlier than norm.  I think the shape of how the TE position finishes backs me up on this too.  You get 2-4 elite players at a time, and that's usually it.  It's a wide gap between those guys and the solid starters, and then a chasm between the solid starters and the ""I'm praying he goes 1/2/1 this week, gimme that 7 points.""

So of the guys I mentioned: Hock, Fant, Thomas, Goedert - would you consider any of those situations so bad that they can't break out?  Or, can you think of any situations so bad their TE can't be good, even if they traded for Kittle tomorrow?  I can think of maybe one, and that'd be Arizona because the system wants to not run TE's - but I'd bet if a Kittle or Kelce were suddenly on their team, they'd be running 3 WR 1 TE a lot more.

So what I'm driving at here, is I think the best chance for a true breakout candidate lies in the hands of the best talents.  They create their own situation.  If you want a guy that'll finish like 8th, be a good, weekly starter for your team and get solid points every week, sure, I'd go for the Hayden Hurst's ""better situation who cares if he's actually any good"" of the world - he'll get some volume and might pop a few games (and he might legitimately be good too, I don't know yet). But if you want the dark horse guy to finish top 3, which is the context of the original question, I think you try to find the young, elite talents who are just going to demand the ball because they're just that good."
4795,2020-08-20 08:38:49,icwelw,"80 from Cobb and 80 from Witten. Even if you think CeeDee gets 100 this year, add that remaining 60 targets to Jarwin’s 40 and it’s up at 100 for the season. And don’t forget McCarthy is much more pass happy than Garrett ever was."
4796,2020-08-20 03:21:22,icwelw,"I wouldn’t worry about him eating into workload too much tbh. He’s kinda fragile, pretty sure he has a chronic hip condition and had pretty questionable hands and I don’t really see him as an impact blocker where they want to get him on the field for that."
4797,2020-08-19 23:56:49,icwelw,Haha rekt. Love when people just pull clueless definites out of their ass.

4801,2020-08-20 13:15:58,icwelw,"Plus, Tavon Austin and his 30 targets+carries are gone.  Pollard and Zeke already had a combined 91 targets and 387 carries.

I just don't think a team with Pollard, Zeke, Jarwin, Gallup, Lamb, and Cooper is going to waste time getting the ball to Devin Smith, Blake Bell, and Jamize Olawale. It's gonna be those 6 guys and Dak. Beyond that will be table scraps."

4805,2020-10-11 21:32:33,icvwfz,"She has set up fake accounts. Knows where I live. I found her in 2018 after Paradise Cove. Thought she was genuine.
Relaized she is a stalker, specifically told me she uses remote access software, preys on survivors and victims.

Knows where I am and told me she visits places frequently. 

She is dangerous.

My friends know.

She just called me yesterday on 708 719 2634 
4:30 PM CST 10.10.2020

The person is a stalker who claims to be a ""REVERAND"" for something called COPE MINISTRIES. A crorupt organization. She has been stalking me for quite some time. 
Her full name is is Angela Smith 
She stalks people, has access to remote access software and is intrusive. 

She called at 4:30PM CST - TO OUR LANDLINE 7732827928 my mother answered and the person said ""This is Angela, would be interested in a VA Loan"". That was a red flag. She has been calling under fake numbers and pseudonyms.
She knows where we live and stalks us.
This began in May 2020 onward.

When using your service to find inforamtion of THIS NONEXISTANT NUMBER 708 719 2634 430 PM CST 10.10.2020. It said ""Jill is not available."" The call seems to have originated in the Chicago area. She is here currently. Originally she is from Snohomish County SEATTLE. 

She physically stated she has freinds here and goes out to visit people. Shes a person that needs to be included in these phishing attempts and harrassment/stalker calls.

She intercepts other calls as well. She even intercepted one and said ""why does he not crack.""

Angry tone.

Also, she made a fake account on discord and stated under pseudonym that she was ""making a porfolio"" lies and slanders othera without proof. Then states she will lie. And explicitly makes it clear that ""COPE MINISTRIES is not the enemy.""

For someone who never heard of COPE or Angela Smith the individual sure defends them a lot. Why?
That was her posing as a fake. 

She is very dangerous. 

Also after many videos I make and stuff her twitter reflects the same stuff. Almost like she stalks me. She does.
She knows a lot.
Like I said, thought she was legitimate.

Edit: I blocked her back in June 2020 - when I realized what she really was.
She then sent me an email. 
Shes super psychopathic. 

She knows where we Live. Confirmed she has seen me. Has been stalking me for a while.
She has been around the park and is caught on camera.

Shes very dangerous."

4811,2020-09-07 15:48:38,io8r2r,"An interesting theory. I see a pretty clear connection between the slowdown and decline of mormonism with the advent of the internet that I think explains the death of mormonism more simply. Growing up in the 90's I remember non church publications with headline articles about the ""explosive"" and exponential growth of the church that made it destined to become one of the world's largest religions in a relatively short amount of time. We were practically euphoric imagining the unstoppable expansion of mormonism. It was astonishing to me how much the attitude had shifted after I returned from a mission in 2003. The talk seems all doom and gloom now."

4815,2020-09-07 14:16:39,io7x6d,Great game by Dobby.  Was a hard hitting and physical game.  Looking forward to 3 more games just like this.
4816,2020-09-07 14:30:55,io7x6d,Benn on the energy line just worked yesterday.   He was a one man wrecking crew in that first period.
4817,2020-09-07 14:11:39,io7x6d,I think Vegas wasn’t expecting Dallas to come out swinging so hard especially after the Avs series that lacked defense for the most part. I expect Vegas to come more prepared next game.
4818,2020-09-07 15:34:36,io7x6d,"It was really great to see Benn step up and get the energy going for the team right off the first shift. Hes slowing down and doesn't score at the pace he used to, but man he looked like prime Jamie Benn again last night. Forecheck, backcheck, creating opportunities, stealing pucks, big hits. It was just awesome to see a glimmer of the old Benn for a game."
4819,2020-09-07 17:10:08,io7x6d,"I'm honestly getting sick of teams, fans, and the media blaming our success on the other team playing poorly. How many times do we have to make teams look slow and off balance before people recognize that we're the cause of it? Do they think its just a coincidence that their teams starts to improve as soon as we start getting off our own game? (Turtling late in the 3rd for example)"
4820,2020-09-07 16:07:59,io7x6d,"Coming off a slowish series with the 'nucks, a team that kind of turtled for 3 games and wasnt very physical, I kind of expected us to look slow. But I did not expect to start THAT slow. The good news is the third period looked really solid (except for some glaring bad spots) and if we can play a whole game like that we should be in a good spot this series."
4821,2020-09-07 18:38:32,io7x6d,Both goalies played a great game last night. We haven’t seen that style of Dallas Stars hockey in months. It’s insane how those last 2 series went down.  I’ll take it any way they can but we have to be one of the more interesting teams in recent years based on their rollercoaster of styles.
4822,2020-09-07 14:09:05,io7x6d,"Serious question:  pete deboer is a pretty mild-mannered guy while gerard gallant was always on the verge of having an aneurysm.  Do you think that has factored into vegas getting more penalties called against them this year?  

Vegas is a very physical team, maybe the most in the league.  Do they need a coach that works on the refs all game long to save them from a few calls?"
4823,2020-09-07 21:21:47,io7x6d,"I’m seeing a ton of comments about how “boring” this game was. 

Both teams played amazing defensively and the goalie duel was insane. 

The game was intense as fuck. 

The physicality from both teams was brutal. 

If people can’t appreciate defensive play, why the heck are they watching hockey?"
4824,2020-09-07 15:52:41,io7x6d,"Vegas has a slump in scoring right now. Not to take anything away from Demko or Dobby but Vegas has to figure out how to finish their chances. They also need put more bodies in front of the goalie to take away their eyes or tip the puck because they might be getting their chances but the goalie is making a lot of easy saves. Also when they actually catch the goalie out of position, they miss the net or wiff the shot."
4825,2020-09-07 20:33:25,io7x6d,Gotta not aim for Dobby’s chest like Bellatrix did

4830,2020-09-07 15:36:16,io7x6d,"I view this as a lucky win by Dallas. Not that they didn't earn the win, but outshot 13-2 in the third in a one nil game doesn't scream 'dictating the play'.

I feel vegas will come back and tie the series game 2 unless dallas can find another gear."

4834,2020-09-07 14:30:17,io7x6d,"Dallas came out on fire.  If they bring that level every game, I love our chances in this series."
4835,2020-09-07 23:01:04,io7x6d,"""Imagine how this series would have gone if we didint have to use our backup."""
4836,2020-09-07 19:23:42,io7x6d,"Not a single 0-0 period in the Avs series. 2 in the first game of this one. I don't even know what this team is anymore, but I'm here for it."
4837,2020-09-07 14:13:14,io7x6d,I'm no ref so I don't know... But I would think these refs are used to getting ripped enough that they don't let it affect their calls
4838,2020-09-07 14:41:25,io7x6d,I feel like that didn’t really have an impact yesterday. We got a power plays and we cut the first one short and our second one was when they were on the PP
4839,2020-09-07 16:09:50,io7x6d,Sounds familiar.
4840,2020-09-07 17:55:07,io7x6d,I saw a stat this morning that Khudobin allowed no rebound opportunities last night. Part of it his control but also it seemed there was never any Vegas players near the net after shots.
4841,2020-09-07 16:52:34,io7x6d,"Yeah, we made Dobby look like swiss cheese and still lost, you guys gotta do something different soon"

4844,2020-09-07 16:08:47,io7x6d,Thats Stars hockey 101. They get outshot bc they're content to sit on a lead for the entire 3rd.
4845,2020-09-07 17:24:43,io7x6d,What a hot take by someone who probably never watched the Stars play until last night
4846,2020-09-07 17:05:30,io7x6d,Dominating the first two periods does scream dictating the play tho?
4847,2020-09-07 22:44:18,io7x6d,"They held Vegas to 12 shots through the first two periods though. We woke up late but wasn't enough to tie the game up.

Dallas deserved credit for the win. They did what we usually do to teams in limiting their opportunities for most of the 60 minutes."
4848,2020-09-07 19:01:50,io7x6d,Vegas also had about 5 minutes of a man advantage in the third.
4849,2020-09-07 17:50:19,io7x6d,"Personally, I wouldn’t mind if they didn’t realize that for a while"

4851,2020-09-07 18:19:06,io7x6d,Dallas is such a weird team. They’ll score 4 goals in 10 minutes and I’m saying “who the hell is going to beat this team?” and then randomly give up 4 goals straight in the same span. Never know what I’m getting with them.

There is an unimaginably enormous wealth gap, and some of the largest corporations in the US, noteably amazon, do NOT pay their taxes.
They have profited massively during the pandemic as everyone else struggles. Check out r/latestagecapitalism .

Our government also bails our the banks in the billions but is squeamish to even release adequate financial assistance during a pandemic.

This is a sign this society is not set up to value the working person let alone a non-working person.
The middle class worker is gouged with taxes while corporations get away with not paying anything. Then we are set up to feel exactly how you feel; like we are stealing from hard workers. This is the manipulation that works to keep taxes low or nonexistent for the profiteers.

The real stealing is going on blatantly all the time. Real stealing is being committed by the 1%.

Question everything.

Also I think your opinion might change too if you ever find yourself disabled or incapable of working. The welfare systems in place are nightmarish"

4896,2020-09-07 08:04:29,io2wfs,"I mean I can think of a few ways that most work but if you want one that’d be pretty good you’d need some DM approval on having your attacks be reflavored so that they appear from the mech. 

Then what you do with this is:

- Be a small race 

- Take the mounted combatant feat 

- Then make your steel defender a bipedal shape with an area for you to sit inside or at least sit on

- Cast enlarge targeting your steel defender.

- It is now large meaning you have advantage on attacks against any medium or smaller creatures. 

- Take either guns or crossbows and the repeating shot feature and machine gun the enemies down with your attacks.

- Then if there’s an enemy in range you use your bonus action and have the mech attack which will do 1d8+1d4+2+ Your Proficiency. 

That’s honestly the best I could think of In terms of builds that would actually benefit from using it as a mech suit, you also might find good use out of taking sharpshooter since you’ll be getting regular advantage on attacks and thus would benefit more from an accuracy to damage conversion.

This combo becomes available at level 5 and is probably pretty decent until level 9, at which point you get access to 3rd level spells and would probably rather concentrate on those. However once you hit level 11 you can use the spell storing item to have a Tiny servant cast the spell instead of requiring you yourself do it. This means they’ll be the ones holding concentration. 

At this point the combo becomes way better since it can be done like 8x per day and thus will easily be active on almost every combat. The tiny servants themselves also last 8 hours meaning you only need to invest one 3rd and one 2nd level slot per day to have this effect up all the time."
4897,2020-09-07 08:04:59,io2wfs,"I highly doubt that a Steel Defender can equip weapons, unfortunately, although I can imagine that they would be able to benefit from magic items that you infuse, such as a magic ring. However, this is more determinate on your DM. If I was your DM, I'd let a Defender wear custom-made armor (which I'm sure you'd infuse), as there exists armor for humanoids and animals alike, and you can choose their form. Even with a humanoid form, I doubt that a 4 intelligence being would comprehend using weapons in any capacity. However, this could be fixed if you slap an infused Helm of Intellect on your metal buddy. That would definitely make them smart enough to use any and all equipment you give them!

I'm imagining that the best build would be Artificer 15 Wizard 5, or maybe just Artificer 20. What I'm imagining is that you'd use essentially all your 2nd level spellslots to cast Enlarge on your construct, making them Large compared to your Small. Take Mounted Combatant along the way, and use the rest of your spellslots for firepower/supporting your Titan via non-concentration spells such as Longstrider and Jump. Riding on your Titan is pretty beneficial, as you get to benefit from an increased movement speed, as well as a permanent bodyguard. Not to mention that since you're always connected, you will always be in reach of your Titan to cast touch spells on it, as well as Mending to heal it. Said spells, as well as Spider Climb and Haste, can be used on yourself while you are in Pilot mode.

As for specific Infusions, be sure to put a Belt of Giant Strength on your Titan when you reach level 14 in Artificer, as well as Boots of the Winding Path for potential Ronin shenanigans. (Not sure if that would teleport you as well, but I imagine it would as you're riding on them.)

Sorry if my writing's a little inconsistent. Playing as a pilot with a Titan is a great idea! I hope you are inspired by some of my ideas!"
4898,2020-09-07 08:03:45,io2wfs,"I'm going to have to open with the most annoying words to hear in D&D:

You're going to have to speak to your DM about that.

As far as I can tell, RAW steel defender is *technically* a creature so can have magical items attuned to it *if* it has the right parts; but it doesn't have proficiency in anything so any fancy armor, weapons or shields are going to effect it negatively.

Same with using the Steel Defender as a mount, there's nothing in the RAW that says you *can't* but there's nothing that explains that you can either.

As for how it'd work, I'd argue that:

* You can give your steel defender proficiency in 1 ""Load Out"" (Sword and Shield, Two Handed Weapon, Balista etc) but only in the downtime between sessions and at a cost (*edit: Of course these would special weapons with higher than usual stats*) 
* While your not mounted in it, it can act as usual but it attacks with a penalty (Disadvantage maybe?)
* While you're mounted in the Titan enemies have disadvantage to attack you (Not the titan) and it takes your action to attack with titan (but without the penalty)

But that's just off the top of my head, I'm sure smarter people can think up better things"

4936,2020-09-08 05:17:14,io23fc,"I think you fundamentally misunderstand obiter dictum. It's not a section of a judgment where a judge sits down and thinks ""now what are some things I could say that don't precisely relate to my reasoning but are still worth mentioning?"". It's not a ""section"" of the judgment at all actually.

Rather, in expounding their reasoning, judges will often be able to distinguish, define, and better generally explain their ratio by making remarks that end up fitting the definition of obiter dictum. They don't just think to themselves ""this isn't relevant to this case at all but it's interesting to talk about and maybe another case will need this one day"" (I'm not saying this *never* happens, but it's not really that common or meaningful).

If you wanted judges (or their clerks if we're being real) to have to read through their judgments and restate any obiter at the end, then meh, sure, why not? But you can't separate the obiter from the rest of the text. It just doesn't make sense."

Example document:

---

Ratio decidendi

Occasionally, a judge does write something along the lines of ""As an aside, if x had been different, then y."" E.g. cf. Lord Denning's statement on privity in *Central London Property Trust Ltd v. High Trees House Ltd* [1947] KB 130, 136.

> If I were to consider this matter without regard to recent developments in the law, there is no doubt that had the plaintiffs claimed it, they would have been entitled to recover ground rent at the rate of £2,500 a year from the beginning of the term, since the lease under which it was payable was a lease under seal which, according to the old common law, could not be varied by an agreement by parol (whether in writing or not), but only by deed."

5024,2020-09-07 05:57:02,io1zxr,What a run we had. Proud of you dodger bros 💪💪
5025,2020-09-07 06:34:11,io1zxr,Don't forget that JT's been out too
5026,2020-09-07 06:55:27,io1zxr,"Also, a loss at the hands of Matt Kemp doesn't really feel like that much of a loss to me."
5027,2020-09-07 06:08:49,io1zxr,"Because we're in ""Fuck it, let's give people playoff tryouts"" mode right now. Same reason we let Lux bat instead of PHing Mookie. Sure, Mookie is the better player, but we already *know* Mookie is great in big moments. Tonight we let Lux take a tough at bat against a good pitcher in a high pressure moment, and he was fantastic. Thanks to Doc, Lux got a massive confidence boost and will be that much more likely to come through in a big playoff moment if we need him to. 

Fergie has looked rough lately, but he was nails to start the season, and this is the time of year to start trying people out. Tryouts inherently mean sometimes the player will blow it and we'll lose, and that's okay because we're already virtually guaranteed top seed anyways."
5028,2020-09-07 06:04:32,io1zxr,"Because when youre the best team in the MLB you have a little leeway to see which guys are going to be ""your guys"" come October.  Especially in a series where youre going to see the same players multiple times. And though the loss is on Ferguson, it doesnt bode well when you have to come back multiple times in a game."
5029,2020-09-07 06:10:13,io1zxr,"Yeah, I didn't trust him going into that situation but he really put together a wonderful, patient, professional at bat"
5030,2020-09-07 13:11:25,io1zxr,"Yea Ferguson seems to be the cause of a lot of late inning runs this year. He is giving up homeruns at a rate way above his career average. His positives are he is striking out more guys, and walking WAY fewer. He needs to stop meatballing pitches to guys he thinks he can overpower though, he doesn't have that kind of stuff."
5031,2020-09-07 06:15:17,io1zxr,"I dont mind him pitching, but why have him come in to face 2 righties.  Think you have to go to a righty for the start of that inning"
5032,2020-09-07 07:11:54,io1zxr,"The Dodgers saw that LeBron wore a Dodgers hat to the arena when the Lakers played in Houston earlier in the season, and to a game during this series, and they appreciated his support. Then, they remembered that after Manfred released his report, multiple Lakers said that the Astros didn't win anything in 2017, so the boys in blue decided to take this loss for them.

The Dodgers are such givers...

Unless you're a Clippers fan, because I don't want the Dodgers to help them in any way."
5033,2020-09-07 07:17:42,io1zxr,"At least the Lakers won, which means I’m done drinkin for the night LOL"
5034,2020-09-07 06:36:07,io1zxr,Can confirm
5035,2020-09-07 06:19:24,io1zxr,So red and sweaty
5036,2020-09-07 06:01:38,io1zxr,I’m just gonna rekindle my love for him by rewatching those back to back home runs against Archie Bradley for like 900th time
5037,2020-09-07 06:19:01,io1zxr,Bummer because he was clutch last year. He’s a strikeout machine right now
5038,2020-09-07 07:01:01,io1zxr,"Some people here were not happy with me when I said that I thought that it was kind of early for everybody to start calling him Hitman last season.

Obviously, he still has plenty of time to turn things around, but I didn't think that it was wise for him to have any nickname (let alone that one) not long after he'd been called up. Every player has to get through numerous adjustments that opposing teams make after they've seen enough footage of them at the major league level, so Hitman can quickly to ""get a hit, man.""

If he makes the playoff roster, hopefully we'll get a chance to see the Matt Beaty that we got to watch last season."
5039,2020-09-07 06:00:50,io1zxr,"Had us in the first half, ngl"
5040,2020-09-07 06:04:27,io1zxr,I don’t really get this.  Is it really gonna make losing in the playoffs better knowing the Rockies took 2/3 from us in early September?
5041,2020-09-07 06:18:52,io1zxr,">Mookie, however, should never stay on the bench when he represents the winning run.

Here's the thing though: Lux doesn't have a ton of experience this year. He's had a rough time of stopping and starting ST, then getting send to USC purgatory to take BP with some other arms while waiting to be called up for 5 weeks. He's clearly a little rusty, and hasn't had a real chance to break out or show his true stuff. 

Tonight, Doc tested him. If we're gonna rely on Lux in the playoffs, he needs experience taking at bats in high pressure spots like the one he took tonight. Sure, we could have PH Mookie, but it was more valuable to risk losing the game in order to give Lux some confidence in a situation like that. 

And he did great! That was a fantastic at bat, against a tough, hard-throwing pitcher, and he saw 10 pitches and put the bat in Seager's hands. That's going to pay off huge down the road at some point, and those are the kind of at bats Lux needs right now. We may have lost the game, but we don't really care about that anyways. Mookie may have won it for us, but instead we gained confidence for both Lux and Rios, and that's important considering Mookie is already rock solid and those two haven't had nearly as much time to get good looks in those spots this year. I think it was the right call."
5042,2020-09-07 06:00:25,io1zxr,Docs critical thinking in these situations always favors “tomorrow” and not “today” if he rests a player it’s a good chance he won’t see an inning
5043,2020-09-07 05:57:03,io1zxr,Now we’re talking. Any other teams in the same boat?
5044,2020-09-07 06:06:40,io1zxr,It’ll be interesting to see the effect of COVID on the home field advantage
5045,2020-09-07 06:08:55,io1zxr,Would have been nice if it wasn’t to a fucking sub .500 team though
5046,2020-09-07 06:16:43,io1zxr,Plz no. I dont want to see a stadium full of fans doing a move like some midwestern team.
5047,2020-09-07 05:57:21,io1zxr,Nah.
5048,2020-09-07 05:58:37,io1zxr,"No Mookie, no jt, doc not really using his entire bullpen/bench/rotation,  nothing like what a playoff will feel like"
5049,2020-09-07 10:17:46,io1zxr,Didn’t we beat your Padres in a bo3 back in august?
5050,2020-09-07 06:43:25,io1zxr,"Pollock doesn’t just decide to steal bases, he gets a sign from a coach to steal. Also, I can’t help but remind you that I can recall him outrunning several routine ground balls this season."
5051,2020-09-07 06:55:52,io1zxr,"Sending AJ was the right call. It didn’t work out but it was the right call. He was out by a cpl of inches from a perfect throw from Blackmon. If that throw is slightly less than perfect, i.e. 6 inches high or left then AJ is safe by a mile and we now have a runner in scoring position. A runner in scoring position that would’ve scored on thAt Big Willy Style single up the middle. These outs will happen when attempting to manufacture runs and not solely depending on the long ball."
5052,2020-09-07 08:36:20,io1zxr,He’s gotten so large. Like he’s one of us
5053,2020-09-07 06:30:06,io1zxr,"Oh come on, it was fun"
5054,2020-09-07 06:01:27,io1zxr,:(
5055,2020-09-07 06:04:39,io1zxr,"Padres don’t matter. We have 30 wins. With 18 games left, there’s no way they win 5 more games than we do. If they’re perfect and win 18 in a row, then we have to go 13-5 which was our winning percent going into tonight. 

Now Imagine they go 13-5, we could go as bad as 8-10, below .500 and they’d tie it with us."
5056,2020-09-07 09:06:16,io1zxr,"Read the above message again. These games don’t really matter anymore. It’s more or less figuring out what we have, how they perform in “X” situation and developing your gameplan for October. Plus, with the new rules, our lefties and righties are going to have to pitch to the opposite hitting players. We need to figure out who can and who can’t."
5057,2020-09-07 07:13:54,io1zxr,I was at that second game. It has to be one of the best live Dodger moments for me.
5058,2020-09-07 06:10:22,io1zxr,Underrated comment
5059,2020-09-07 06:44:32,io1zxr,"Lux did have a great at-bats, and I agree with your points. I have always been a Lux fan, and I thought that him starting the year off of the major league roster was way overblown. 

I just love winning too much. That walk was great, but just recently Mookie went out there and tied the game with one swing in the 9th, and that home run is still so fresh in my mind.  I'm glad that Lux had that great at-bat, but very few players on this team would feel slighted if  Mookie pinch hit for them. 

Also, the winning."
5060,2020-09-07 06:14:45,io1zxr,"I get that, but the Dodgers don't even play tomorrow. They also have Friday off, so if Mookie is healthy, he probably could have handled that one at-bat and still be rested."
5061,2020-09-07 06:36:57,io1zxr,No for pollock sliding into 2nd lol
5062,2020-09-07 06:00:18,io1zxr,"That might be true, but that doesn't change the fact that a 3 game playoff series is beyond stupid"
5063,2020-09-08 01:42:31,io1zxr,Well we wont be having a b03 agaisnt the rockies
5064,2020-09-07 06:07:18,io1zxr,"I admire your optimism but I think their remaining schedule looks easier than ours. I have a feeling it will come down to the SD-LA series for who wins the division, but I guess since the post season is expanded it doesn't matter too too much."
5065,2020-09-07 06:16:57,io1zxr,I agree. I also would’ve liked to see mookie over Beaty or even Rios or lux
5066,2020-09-07 06:11:00,io1zxr,I agree
5067,2020-09-07 06:09:46,io1zxr,They literally aren't catching us this team is to skilled. The bullpen will get back on track.
5068,2020-09-07 06:09:20,io1zxr,Not sure if you’re appreciating how many games back 5 is with how short the season is. We realistically can play .400 ball and still win the division.
5069,2020-09-07 11:15:27,io1zxr,Im not worried about the Padres catching us at all. All our focus should be on playing well and staying healthy.
5070,2020-09-07 06:12:23,io1zxr,Yeah thanks for putting it into perspective. I think I'm buying into everyone's obsession with the Dads as the hottest team since sliced bread
5071,2020-09-07 06:17:12,io1zxr,"Our magic number is like 14( not sure what it exactly is). That means pretty much we win 14 out 18, dads lose 0, or a combination of dads losses and our wins."
5072,2020-09-07 06:50:09,io1zxr,Yup! We are far better. Guys like muncy belli and joc are still slumping and we are still the best team in baseball. Pads are good but I’m genuinely not concerned about them. Some dodger fans are damn near bending over for them and we haven’t even played them yet lol

5093,2020-09-07 01:26:39,iny1vu,"Agreed with basically all of that.

The mentality is so far off where it needs to be. Talent is not ELITE, but in my opinion not as bad as the current set up exhibits.

I believe it to be more on the site of poor management than a squad that reflects where it is on the ladder. We currently have very few players playing at or above their peak. Those few you named are those players.

Conditioning and mentality are key pieces to a consistent, winning team. We have sorely missed both for far too long. What do you think?"
5094,2020-09-07 05:46:15,iny1vu,"Okay, so the few changes I'd make.

Heppell seems harsh at B considering he's only played 3 games coming of pretty serious foot/ankle injuries, averages a bit over 13 disposals a game which isn't amazing but sits at 80% Efficiency which is elite. 
If his disposal numbers were higher id have him A. Also quarters are shorter.

Stringer if have B. Yes he was leading our goal kicking for ages.... on 10. He averages 7 disposals at 51% efficiency. Was great when we were winning early in the year but has been ineffective since coming back from injury. 

Hurley I'd have C. He cannot play 1v1. He's always excelled at being the cut off Backman. But Ridley is playing that.

Phillips B from his pure effort. Not the best player but he's usually one of the only ones that wants to win the ball when he's out there.

Ham I'd give C. Hes been serviceable. 

Langford I'd almost give S if I'm being honest which is great.

You also missed zacka who I'd give C purely off a couple blinders. Without them every other game he was E. 

BZT has been a big let down in the last few games honestly. 

Lastly, Redman. E. He's just been a liability this year. Honestly had not done much at all."
5095,2020-09-07 06:25:27,iny1vu,"Agree with some of these but some are a bit wrong.

Clarke and Snelling A tier? No wonder we suck.

Zerk has been D at best. Redman E. Hurley D.

Hibberd was recruiting to play inside win and the genius Rutten has him play on a wing for some unknown reason."
5096,2020-09-07 02:50:09,iny1vu,"The playing group is largely performing about as well as should be expected. There is a lack of true elite talent and there has been since the early 2000's.

Recruitment has been poor for some time and if it weren't for father/son gimmes, it'd be even poorer.

Excluding legacy players, who are the best players Dodoro has drafted in his 22 years at the club? It will give a very good idea of why Essendon haven't finished in the top 4 since 2001 and have been mediocre at best ever since."
5097,2020-09-07 10:08:40,iny1vu,Would probably move Phillips up to B tier. He hasn’t played a whole lot of games for us but when he has played he has been great around the ground and just competing in the ruck.
5098,2020-09-07 04:35:30,iny1vu,"Dylan Clarke has kicked 3 goals in his career. From memory, one wasn’t a set shot."
5099,2020-09-07 06:59:25,iny1vu,Gleeson should be F. That bloke has lost all his talent after that ankle injury and I don’t see him being any better in the future.

5101,2020-09-07 09:01:21,iny1vu,Hurley is unbelievably bad 1v1 hasn’t beat his man since Buddy 2 seasons ago
5102,2020-09-07 02:11:41,iny1vu,"Every club in the league has had difficulties this year. Apart from Brisbane and Gold Coast, everyone is dealing with exceptional circumstances. Unless everything is perfect this club and playing list seems to fall apart. A couple of weeks ago John Worsfold was complaining about a free kick just before halftime and how they lost momentum. Jesus there was still a half to go and there was a kick in it. And yesterday they got to the ground an hour before the game, so everyone just throws in the towel. This playing list can not play a solid four quarters of football and they are given too many outs by the football department and the supporter base in general."

5110,2020-09-08 06:15:19,inx72c,He'll be injured by the half. Dude is made of glass
5111,2020-09-07 19:18:22,inx72c,I’m a Packers fan and from what I’ve read it doesn’t seem likely Dillon will factor in much at all this season. He didn’t have a great camp
5112,2020-09-07 12:30:08,inx72c,"Jamaal Williams isn't someone I'm overlooking, just someone I don't see being relevant enough to play. He may get a few catches, but he's a very TD-dependent play."
5113,2020-09-07 16:44:57,inx72c,"I'm personally just not confident in Gurley being a strong option this week. It's certainly possible, I just don't see him being worth his salary. Falcons seem much more geared to pass than run the ball, but I could be hella wrong against Seattle. 🤷‍♂️"
5114,2020-09-08 16:52:56,inx72c,"Agree with you. Seahawks gave up 4.9 YPC last season and then lost Clowney. Falcons will run the ball. Not only this, Gurley is a great receiving back. Adds up to a smash play that is going overlooked."
5115,2020-09-10 22:26:51,inx72c,Personally I'd go Landry since he doesn't have Stephon Gilmore covering him like Devante Parker will
5116,2020-09-15 09:47:28,inx72c,"Yes, it will be relatively soon. I started a new job recently with a more normal schedule so my sleep schedule's a bit off, but I'll hopefully get these out more consistently either Tuesday night or Wednesday morning some time each week. I don't know it it'll be as in-depth per game, but I'll talk about key players at the very least."
5117,2020-09-08 06:16:42,inx72c,"Plus, Gurley sucks. He'll pop off a big game here and there but too risky for me"
5118,2020-09-08 17:06:40,inx72c,Falcons oline has improved Gurley will be a top five RB this season i see gurley putting up big numbers in that offense
5119,2020-09-09 01:23:15,inx72c,"Definitely not top 5 lol. Falcons won't field a top 16 line, but they will be better than what the Rams were last year by a lot. Plus, I just dont think Gurley has top 5 positional talent anymore. Cook, CMC, Barkley, Elliott, and Kamara will all finish ahead of him easily. Then you have guys such as Sanders, Drake, Jacobs, Henry and Chubb. Just isnt happening."

5123,2021-01-10 01:08:27,inwxlq,"Thank you so much for weighing in. 

Unfortunately, it's not as updated as I'd like. The hearing with victim statements was hard for me to make sense of. There was no transcript and no coherent report from news outlets. 

There were random clips of proceedings but I couldn't make out who was speaking on which days or if the clips were complete. Things seem missing. 

And lastly, I couldn't listen to it. During COVID-19 especially, it's just too much. So those days are missing a complete rundown of what happened and who spoke. 

But again, I REALLY appreciate this comment."

As someone who knew a little about the case there were really fascinating things on there, like the one video of him in a casual setting with only about 7k views, I couldn't believe it"
5125,2021-01-10 05:50:26,inwxlq,"Thank you for these comments. 

I first made this timeline when he was arrested. I didn't know anything about the case and thankfully had not followed it. 

My goal was to create a framework within which we could all place DeAngelo's day to day life against the murders. To my surprise, three years later, we have no information. 

I thought by now we would at least have time sheets, and be able to say what DeAngelo was doing before and after each crime. I'm so surprised we don't. 

Thanks again for your comments."

5127,2020-09-07 01:35:08,inv86g,"what you are saying makes a lot of sense. I do relate more to surrounding yourself with people who support you. I had an acid trip on the weekend and was saying to my friend that you need to surround yourself with people who reflect your energy you give to them back to you, like a big group of light prisms all reflecting light back on each other. I had a specific vision of that and it nearly brought me to tears."

5229,2020-09-07 00:18:11,inuyf5,#*KNIGHT*!!!
5230,2020-09-07 00:25:21,inuyf5,The fuck is that flower?
5231,2020-09-07 00:25:48,inuyf5,START UP THE COMEBACK MACHINE
5232,2020-09-07 00:26:04,inuyf5,Does Cousins know that he's actually supposed to shoot at the net?
5233,2020-09-07 00:26:43,inuyf5,"TAKE MY POWER, FLOWER !"
5234,2020-09-07 00:30:19,inuyf5,They’re making us look like the Canucks
5235,2020-09-07 00:37:36,inuyf5,Reaves is going to be very appreciated when he returns I can already tell
5236,2020-09-07 00:38:01,inuyf5,We're getting manhandled. Not what I'm used to seeing at all.
5237,2020-09-07 00:38:41,inuyf5,The boys will find their game soon rn they’re just feeling the stars out
5238,2020-09-07 00:40:49,inuyf5,I love Fleury but his style of play is heart attack inducing.
5239,2020-09-07 00:46:19,inuyf5,"Nothing looks crisp. Whiffing on pass attempts, missing the net, not establishing any semblance of a forecheck, etc."
5240,2020-09-07 00:56:33,inuyf5,Looks like they're starting to wake up
5241,2020-09-07 00:57:28,inuyf5,"Well, that was better play towards the end of the period. They are adjusting to the fact that they just can't out-muscle this team the way they did Vancouver."
5242,2020-09-07 01:12:48,inuyf5,"[Pics for proof because you asked for it] (https://imgur.com/a/t7Juhl3)

I moved my jersey here for the round robin while cleaning and this is where it has been all playoffs."
5243,2020-09-07 01:22:18,inuyf5,🌺🐽🌺
5244,2020-09-07 01:25:31,inuyf5,We look fucking suck.
5245,2020-09-07 01:25:42,inuyf5,Did we transform into the Canucks??? What is this
5246,2020-09-07 01:26:34,inuyf5,Zero SOG in the second period
5247,2020-09-07 01:44:47,inuyf5,woulda been cool if Nate could have made that one
5248,2020-09-07 01:57:02,inuyf5,Hopefully this PP is massive and not like all the others which have been the size of my PP. Big PPs only please.
5249,2020-09-07 02:09:37,inuyf5,The DJ is playing the wrong P!ATD song. I want to hear “Vegas Lights”
5250,2020-09-07 02:16:44,inuyf5,Patches fan damn
5251,2020-09-07 02:27:40,inuyf5,We are only down one point. And we have spent a lot of time on offense this period. We can still do this.
5252,2020-09-07 01:53:17,inuyf5,I’m disappointed in the lack of Jam memes considering Fleury is in net
5253,2020-09-07 01:53:42,inuyf5,"There be trolls around. 
Don't feed them. Don't get into a meaningless ""discussion"".
Focus on the task at hand."
5254,2020-09-06 23:47:30,inuyf5,LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO KNIGHTS
5255,2020-09-07 00:03:54,inuyf5,Pierre looks like a hairy big toe
5256,2020-09-07 00:15:00,inuyf5,Casual Reavo looking like a snack
5257,2020-09-07 00:16:13,inuyf5,"Imagine you wanted to watch hockey


But nbc said


No"
5258,2020-09-07 00:17:52,inuyf5,Man. I can’t believe we’re here again. Feels like so long ago but not at all. Life is crazy
5259,2020-09-07 00:26:19,inuyf5,"We’re getting out-skated right now, and I’m not liking the look of this so far"
5260,2020-09-07 00:30:58,inuyf5,Damn this is really bad. We’re just shoveling the puck out not even trying to formulate an offense. Team still can’t fucking shoot
5261,2020-09-07 00:32:28,inuyf5,"Obviously not the start we wanted but it makes me think if this Stars speed threat is just an adrenaline dump. I see us playing our game, somewhat and just have to weather the storm. I cant see them staying up with our eventual grind"
5262,2020-09-07 00:33:51,inuyf5,"My fear right now is that following the loss of his dad, this Vegas drama has just solidly taken the wind out of Fleury.

That said, I’ll never stop believing 🤷‍♀️"
5263,2020-09-07 00:36:00,inuyf5,Damn 🗿 might’ve lost some tooth
5264,2020-09-07 00:39:14,inuyf5,Reaver is watching and taking notes
5265,2020-09-07 00:48:14,inuyf5,Stone is getting beat up
5266,2020-09-07 00:49:14,inuyf5,Hope that Stars dude is good. It didn't look like too hard of a hit though so I'm not sure what happened to him
5267,2020-09-07 00:51:11,inuyf5,Marchy has been a giveaway machine lately.
5268,2020-09-07 00:51:30,inuyf5,"Oh hey look, a forecheck!"
5269,2020-09-07 00:55:51,inuyf5,We have as many icings as shots on goal
5270,2020-09-07 00:58:00,inuyf5,Let's get an adjustment at intermission and come out strong in the second. Go Knights Go!
5271,2020-09-07 01:22:05,inuyf5,No PPs allowed tonight I guess
5272,2020-09-07 01:30:54,inuyf5,Schmidt needs to shoot that he was open.
5273,2020-09-07 01:31:14,inuyf5,🌸!
5274,2020-09-07 01:36:59,inuyf5,"Smith just got owned.  
Need to fix that."
5275,2020-09-07 01:43:49,inuyf5,I see we are continuing with the shooting into the chest strategy.
5276,2020-09-07 01:46:00,inuyf5,Another bad clear attempt by Shea wtf
5277,2020-09-07 01:48:30,inuyf5,Wild Bill. I'm ready
5278,2020-09-07 01:49:03,inuyf5,This team is literally wasting our time
5279,2020-09-07 02:00:51,inuyf5,I’m stuck at work. How do we only have 12 shots on goal? Bad passing or are they just shutting us down?
5280,2020-09-07 02:11:54,inuyf5,We will win this
5281,2020-09-07 02:12:03,inuyf5,Sucks so much ass right now that Fleury only has a .957 save percentage. Get that bum off the ice.
5282,2020-09-07 02:12:48,inuyf5,I believe that we can win
5283,2020-09-07 02:15:03,inuyf5,*BLESS THAT RIGHT PAD*
5284,2020-09-07 02:20:46,inuyf5,"If we give Doby a pair of socks, would that distract him enough to let a puck sneak by?"
5285,2020-09-07 02:22:21,inuyf5,Stars starting to look tired now. Gotta out work them.
5286,2020-09-07 02:38:30,inuyf5,"Backloaded our bad games with the Nucks and looks like we frontloaded our bad game with the Stars. Either way, we looked competitive at the end. We got this."
5287,2020-09-07 02:41:26,inuyf5,We definitely need to fix the entire offense.  Tired of seeing Martinez and Schmidt shoot all the time at the goalie’s chest.
5288,2020-09-07 02:52:05,inuyf5,Fun fact: the New Jersey Devils and Detroit Redwings scored the same amount of goals as us tonight
5289,2020-09-07 02:52:49,inuyf5,"In all fairness, in addition to our early game woes, the puck luck was all Dallass tonight.  Ever pinball puck landed on a Stars stick it seemed."
5290,2020-09-07 01:08:22,inuyf5,"Not a goal Flower would like to give up early, but he got better as the period went on. Tough spot for getting the start in game 1 of the conference final after not playing in so long.

The rest of the team started improving their play late in the period. That unforced error at blue line by Martinez hurt because it looked like we had something going then. 

Going forward, we've just gotta put passes on the tape which will eliminate all of those icings, stay out of the box and finish instead of missing the damn net. Life is too comfy for Khudobin right now."
5291,2020-09-07 01:47:48,inuyf5,Should that not have been a PS?
5292,2020-09-07 01:47:49,inuyf5,Should be a penalty shot
5293,2020-09-07 01:29:56,inuyf5,Just saying we're undefeated in games where I get Reddit gold.
5294,2020-09-07 01:32:30,inuyf5,"Starting to see some spark and some chances, just gotta keep this up"
5295,2020-09-06 23:56:44,inuyf5,"Sick 'em high

Sick 'em low

Sick 'em where the sun don't show

#Go Knights Go!"
5296,2020-09-06 23:56:58,inuyf5,There is going to be so much good hockey in this series. These teams are both very gritty and talented. Both are excellent teams and I am so happy we got this match up.
5297,2020-09-06 23:57:40,inuyf5,"Omg I'm loving these local commercials with Schmidt, Karlsson, etc. Amazing.

Beats five dollar footlong, at least..."
5298,2020-09-07 00:10:23,inuyf5,I guess there’s no need to start the 4th line without Reavo in the lineup
5299,2020-09-07 00:15:16,inuyf5,Reavo looking quite dapper 😳
5300,2020-09-07 00:18:28,inuyf5,omg fleurys mustache makes him look like an evil version of himself 🤦‍♀️
5301,2020-09-07 00:28:51,inuyf5,Stars play a fast and physical game when on point. We need to be prepped for that and get some good hits in...
5302,2020-09-07 00:32:29,inuyf5,Shea boutta tie this game up
5303,2020-09-07 00:35:08,inuyf5,"I could be wrong, but we're spending far too much time in our defensive zone."
5304,2020-09-07 00:35:52,inuyf5,Shit. Stone in the locker room
5305,2020-09-07 00:42:31,inuyf5,Well that's one way to kill a PP...
5306,2020-09-07 00:42:46,inuyf5,"Vegas: have a PP

Dallas: nah bro"
5307,2020-09-07 00:42:59,inuyf5,Is it weird that I like our 5v4 PK over 4v4?
5308,2020-09-07 00:43:03,inuyf5,Great PK boys
5309,2020-09-07 00:46:57,inuyf5,You’d think this was a back to back the way they’re moving
5310,2020-09-07 00:48:09,inuyf5,We can't keep the puck out of our side. Fuck.
5311,2020-09-07 00:51:29,inuyf5,We're starting to bang back and win board battles
5312,2020-09-07 01:04:15,inuyf5,Oof this games making me happy Cody “bones made of” Glass isn’t playing and that whitecloud can take a beating
5313,2020-09-07 01:19:33,inuyf5,NEED A BIG PP
5314,2020-09-07 01:22:43,inuyf5,WE NEED **BOOSTER JUICE!**
5315,2020-09-07 01:26:48,inuyf5,Just doesn’t look like we can control the puck at all. Need to get our heads together
5316,2020-09-07 01:28:14,inuyf5,"Hey, I think it's hard to score without shooting the puck, but I'm not a professional hockeyman."
5317,2020-09-07 01:28:24,inuyf5,Fuck now my smoke detector started chirping.
5318,2020-09-07 01:28:54,inuyf5,We used up our shot allotment against Vancouver. Now we're going through austerity.
5319,2020-09-07 01:29:24,inuyf5,Aight that looked good. More of that with a dash of scoring please
5320,2020-09-07 01:29:45,inuyf5,"Nice hit by Cousins. Can't hit the net, but apparently he can hit Stars"
5321,2020-09-07 01:30:44,inuyf5,Glass needs to just gain 10 pounds of muscle and just practice faceoffs for 5 months. I'm sick being shit on on faceoffs
5322,2020-09-07 01:30:47,inuyf5,"Some flashes of VGK hockey here, including Marche fanning on a shot"
5323,2020-09-07 01:37:34,inuyf5,Well that was sad.
5324,2020-09-07 01:43:01,inuyf5,We said “40 SOG curse lets get less than 40” we just gotta make those count
5325,2020-09-07 01:43:42,inuyf5,I want a VGK goal pls
5326,2020-09-07 01:45:35,inuyf5,Bad clear by Shea
5327,2020-09-07 01:46:31,inuyf5,There’s 🗿!
5328,2020-09-07 01:47:39,inuyf5,I love that NBC is realizing that the game is so boring that they can just shove a commercial in there during a faceoff without a media break.
5329,2020-09-07 01:48:20,inuyf5,Let’s get a whole PP to ourselves please. No sharing
5330,2020-09-07 01:48:43,inuyf5,Wtf is going on
5331,2020-09-07 01:49:38,inuyf5,Only down 1. We're still in this. I for one am ready to experience third period VGK hockey
5332,2020-09-07 02:10:20,inuyf5,Carrier down into their zone and literally nobody else in there with him when he needs to pass.
5333,2020-09-07 02:15:01,inuyf5,ALL HAIL THE RIGHT PAD
5334,2020-09-07 02:15:27,inuyf5,Hot take - we will score on this PP
5335,2020-09-07 02:17:24,inuyf5,RIP Theodore’s stick
5336,2020-09-07 02:19:33,inuyf5,Schmitty hitting dead center every fucking time. Sign him up for the next Suicide Squad movie.
5337,2020-09-07 02:26:23,inuyf5,Can't connect on a pass
5338,2020-09-07 02:37:44,inuyf5,"Despite the whole, ‘Fleury didnt deserve that loss’, my money is on them riding Lehner from here on out."
5339,2020-09-07 00:12:27,inuyf5,Between the pandemic and changing careers and getting engaged: it feels like a lifetime ago we were in the Western Finals but it was just two years
5340,2020-09-07 00:13:43,inuyf5,How about we drop a fucking puck
5341,2020-09-07 00:52:58,inuyf5,"Please beat these guys. Beat the hell out of them. I really can’t stand the stars. They are dirty, dirty little bitches. - a sad CO fan"
5342,2020-09-07 01:50:54,inuyf5,Oof. So Reavo is our talisman I guess.
5343,2020-09-07 02:20:52,inuyf5,WHERES THE HOLDING CALL!
5344,2020-09-07 02:21:49,inuyf5,"Flyers fan coming in saying I’m rooting for you guys hard, such a fun team to watch."
5345,2020-09-07 02:25:24,inuyf5,To be fair. We have almost caught up on SoG. Seems like we are playing a little better Than the first 2 periods.
5346,2020-09-07 00:01:16,inuyf5,"Schmidty, I don't want a Hyundai!

Yay we get Fleury!!

LETS GO KNIGHTS!!!"
5347,2020-09-07 00:09:30,inuyf5,"Bless the flower, eat the jam!!!!"
5348,2020-09-07 00:12:59,inuyf5,REALLY? Matt balldestroyer Dumba?!
5349,2020-09-07 00:13:14,inuyf5,#GO KNIGHTS GO
5350,2020-09-07 00:17:54,inuyf5,KIGHT!
5351,2020-09-07 00:21:13,inuyf5,I love Khudobin’s mask with Dobby the elf
5352,2020-09-07 00:25:10,inuyf5,3 on 2 🤦🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
5353,2020-09-07 00:25:29,inuyf5,Don’t like that
5354,2020-09-07 00:31:26,inuyf5,"The Stars are fast. And here for a reason. 
On the flip side, so are we. 
So, whatcha do about it??"
5355,2020-09-07 00:32:10,inuyf5,Let the guys settle down. We're not even 10 minutes into the 1st period of game one.
5356,2020-09-07 00:35:08,inuyf5,Getting absolutely bullied out there
5357,2020-09-07 00:37:42,inuyf5,PDB needs to check them
5358,2020-09-07 00:39:59,inuyf5,Muffin Man got his Muffin Mask!
5359,2020-09-07 00:40:58,inuyf5,This team is playing soft as fuck right now. No way all our physicality is because of a reaves
5360,2020-09-07 00:41:26,inuyf5,We gotta speed it up
5361,2020-09-07 00:42:55,inuyf5,Don’t you dare start pavelski
5362,2020-09-07 00:42:58,inuyf5,What a shit penalty lol
5363,2020-09-07 00:44:02,inuyf5,🌸
5364,2020-09-07 00:46:00,inuyf5,"what was going on, on the dallas bench, with that guy's hand?"
5365,2020-09-07 00:47:37,inuyf5,A Tuch Goal would be real cool rn :)
5366,2020-09-07 00:48:15,inuyf5,"For being the more physical team, Dallas sure is getting hurt a lot"
5367,2020-09-07 00:48:36,inuyf5,Chandler with the Charlie horse lol
5368,2020-09-07 00:49:33,inuyf5,The boys just look tired out there.
5369,2020-09-07 00:54:18,inuyf5,Cousins getting great chances tonight
5370,2020-09-07 00:54:31,inuyf5,That “FUCK” by Cousins was perfect
5371,2020-09-07 00:54:49,inuyf5,Damn Cuzz x2
5372,2020-09-07 00:55:07,inuyf5,"I'd like one of those shots to go, please. We've been so snakebitten when it comes to the greasy stuff."
5373,2020-09-07 00:55:47,inuyf5,We're finally getting our legs
5374,2020-09-07 00:58:47,inuyf5,FIQ: What's your favorite Zelda game?
5375,2020-09-07 01:14:03,inuyf5,OK I put on deodorant so hopefully that should help the boys even the scoreboard!
5376,2020-09-07 01:20:36,inuyf5,Well that’s not fun.
5377,2020-09-07 01:21:10,inuyf5,imagine if the whole series goes like this with PP's
5378,2020-09-07 01:21:36,inuyf5,REFS CAN SUCK A FAT DICK
5379,2020-09-07 01:21:37,inuyf5,Ticky tac bullshit
5380,2020-09-07 01:24:15,inuyf5,"Hollly shit I thought that was going in, PHEW"
5381,2020-09-07 01:27:32,inuyf5,We need to get some momentum going ASAP
5382,2020-09-07 01:28:26,inuyf5,That hit was nice. Could be a momentum shift. Need that.
5383,2020-09-07 01:28:27,inuyf5,Now Shea can't keep it in the zone either 🤦🏽‍♂️
5384,2020-09-07 01:34:47,inuyf5,Has anyone seen stone?
5385,2020-09-07 01:40:14,inuyf5,Lehner looking like he's watching intently and studying what the Stars are doing to get ready to play against them. Was pretty cool to see. Sometimes you see the backup goalie just kind of sitting there not engaged.
5386,2020-09-07 01:40:43,inuyf5,🌺🌺
5387,2020-09-07 01:40:56,inuyf5,I just puckered half my undies into my ass
5388,2020-09-07 01:41:25,inuyf5,Okay we need more shots on goal.
5389,2020-09-07 01:41:35,inuyf5,"What the hell happened there!? Looked like Whitecloud was trying to took it past Flower lol. Chaos.

EDIT: Whitecloud fell over him after the puck went past the post off the back of his stick."
5390,2020-09-07 01:43:40,inuyf5,"So we can't exit our zone cleanly, dallas is taking away the neutral zone and forcing us to play dump and chase, and they're winning a lot of those board battles.

5553,2020-09-07 01:26:00,inuyf5,"I feel like for the past 4 games, every possession we have had, the opposition has had 5 people between us on the net, but they break frequently against a couple of Knights. Probably selection bias."
5554,2020-09-07 01:27:04,inuyf5,"Im really getting sick of these announcers never talking about the good things Vegas is doing. Like legit, never. And its the ""home"" stream. I don't get it. Same shit all playoffs. It's getting very annoying"
5555,2020-09-07 01:36:49,inuyf5,"Oh, that’s completely unacceptable. You don’t get to hit Reilly fucking Smith like that."

5560,2020-09-07 01:48:36,inuyf5,Start the third with the biggest of PP’s.
5561,2020-09-07 01:59:31,inuyf5,"I've considered the stakes and the options and, you know, let's just come out and win this one in regulation"
5562,2020-09-07 02:17:26,inuyf5,"People complain about our guys being thugs and assholes, but Dallas is WAYYYY more goon than anyone other than Reaves."
5563,2020-09-07 02:28:00,inuyf5,The Knights are finding their game. I like Tuch and Stone together. Tuch is so big and strong on the puck I thought he would be the one that the Stars couldn't find an answer for in this game. He's almost broken free a couple of times now.
5564,2020-09-07 02:30:34,inuyf5,Jeez Whitecloud

5893,2020-09-07 02:33:21,inuyf5,Xoxoxoxoxo

5895,2020-09-07 00:39:58,inuyf5,I like you
5896,2020-09-07 00:40:53,inuyf5,"I'm definitely not worried about losing this one. We have beat them before, we gonna beat them again."
5897,2020-09-07 00:01:39,inuyf5,You had me at Guinness
5898,2020-09-07 00:00:31,inuyf5,Me: stressed but ready!
5899,2020-09-07 00:50:47,inuyf5,Bless being sane???? And not memeing???
5900,2020-09-07 01:09:51,inuyf5,Pics or it didn't happen.
5901,2020-09-07 01:09:49,inuyf5,Fine! I'm all in. No shorts.
5902,2020-09-07 01:11:14,inuyf5,I went and swapped my blank away for a Fleury ASG jersey. I feel like they're slowly getting to their game. Let's go boys!
5903,2020-09-07 01:11:32,inuyf5,We need proof
5904,2020-09-07 01:13:09,inuyf5,I put on yoga pants to go to the grocery store but they seemed unnecessary after that so my fiance came out of the den to me cooking steak in just a sweater and my VGK flair 🤷. I say embrace that holiday weekend life
5905,2020-09-07 01:35:27,inuyf5,I mean I saw him maybe once after he went in the locker that’s about it
5906,2020-09-07 01:35:27,inuyf5,\*ouch\*
5907,2020-09-07 01:58:30,inuyf5,oh guaranteed
5908,2020-09-07 01:52:59,inuyf5,Only because of Fleury tbh. Defense has looked absolutely weak.
5909,2020-09-07 01:53:02,inuyf5,We've proven the most dangerous thing a team can do to us these playoffs is take a lead against us.
5910,2020-09-07 02:04:06,inuyf5,"> my wife's boyfriend

What?"
5911,2020-09-07 02:03:24,inuyf5,Well that sucks you have to...wait..wife's what...?
5912,2020-09-07 02:03:45,inuyf5,poly works for some people but definitely not for me so best of fucking luck with that one. We love having you here when you can drop by.
5913,2020-09-07 02:08:29,inuyf5,...did you get married and just never mention it to me or is this copy pasta?
5914,2020-09-07 02:34:51,inuyf5,"Some little aliens are running around with Stone, Patches and Tuch’s goal scoring abilities, Space Jam style"
5915,2020-09-07 02:35:33,inuyf5,Exactly what I'm beginning to think.
5916,2020-09-07 00:29:09,inuyf5,"No, no we don't. No jump in our step right now"
5917,2020-09-07 01:26:41,inuyf5,neither is the zero for goals we're sitting at
5918,2020-09-07 01:27:11,inuyf5,It's Subban's
5919,2020-09-07 01:57:24,inuyf5,if I were them I'd be stuffing my face with carbs
5920,2020-09-07 02:05:36,inuyf5,So basically Malcom Subban? :)
5921,2020-09-07 02:05:14,inuyf5,So Carey Price? :p
5922,2020-09-07 02:20:47,inuyf5,He needs some milk
5923,2020-09-07 02:25:00,inuyf5,We've got this in the 4th period. Not a doubt in my mind.
5924,2020-09-07 02:28:09,inuyf5,"How soon? Like, this game soon? Or Jesus is coming quickly soon?"
5925,2020-09-07 02:28:23,inuyf5,Yes
5926,2020-09-07 02:31:05,inuyf5,Drink every time he passes to his imaginary teammate.

Are you trying to hit it? Cause you're doing a good job"
5928,2020-09-07 00:45:46,inuyf5,Fuck Corey Perry. All my homies hate Corey Perry
5929,2020-09-07 00:46:32,inuyf5,Were the Stars this physical in your series? I must not have been watching close enough.
5930,2020-09-06 23:18:19,inuyf5,"This is TERRIFIC news. 

How's the dog's record so far?"

I'll accept it."

Round 3 and ready to fight 

We are dynamic!"
5933,2020-09-07 00:02:08,inuyf5,Lmao watch the stars bring in their third string and deja vuuu
5934,2020-09-07 00:02:49,inuyf5,His saves still haunt my nightmares.
5935,2020-09-07 00:07:45,inuyf5,😍😍😍😍
5936,2020-09-07 00:58:37,inuyf5,Maybe we had our classic season 3 playoff second period in the first period?
5937,2020-09-07 01:04:20,inuyf5,Ferda 👊🏻
5938,2020-09-07 01:03:59,inuyf5,I dont want to go to a parade when its 117
5939,2020-09-07 01:13:09,inuyf5,there's a pandemic.
5940,2020-09-07 01:37:52,inuyf5,I hope so
5941,2020-09-07 01:53:30,inuyf5,"I feel like if we aren't actively in the lead folks act like we're falling apart. No team plays three perfect periods every night, and no team wins every game.

But we're gonna win this one so it's moot"
5942,2020-09-07 00:18:00,inuyf5,Whatcha got against Dumba??
5943,2020-09-07 00:19:07,inuyf5,I bellowed DUMBA when they listed the nominees and then had to explain why to my kid
5944,2020-09-07 00:29:05,inuyf5,I do like the Tuch skating.
5945,2020-09-07 00:36:35,inuyf5,For. Real.
5946,2020-09-07 00:57:41,inuyf5,hell to the yeah!
5947,2020-09-07 00:59:05,inuyf5,I tried my best ok :(
5948,2020-09-07 01:08:47,inuyf5,I like this narrative better than that they are tired because they just got out of a seven game series with only one day off.
5949,2020-09-07 01:06:29,inuyf5,Deboers account?
5950,2020-09-07 01:13:08,inuyf5,Proof that without Reaves we are a slower skating team
5951,2020-09-07 01:43:18,inuyf5,NBC never stopped shitting on us

5958,2020-09-07 02:34:14,inuyf5,I'd prefer to do it before the empty net comes into play to save myself of the heart attack but I'll take one for the team if it means we tie it up
5959,2020-09-07 01:59:04,inuyf5,"But Reaves is out, who's gonna do the Reality Check?!"
5960,2020-09-06 23:39:29,inuyf5,Nah. Super relaxed after being stressed for game 7.

5965,2020-09-07 00:10:57,inuyf5,Just throw them in the air and wave them in a non-caring fashion.
5966,2020-09-07 00:20:21,inuyf5,I’ve memorized it now from all these intros
5967,2020-09-07 00:20:46,inuyf5,I was just saying that last game.
5968,2020-09-07 00:21:07,inuyf5,I was about to say that lol!

5977,2020-09-07 00:26:24,inuyf5,That wasnt great
5978,2020-09-07 00:27:55,inuyf5,"Don't have to be a hater to know that was a shot that should've been stopped.

Despite the narrative, no one here hates Fleury. Thinking Lehner is better than him is a completely different thing."
5979,2020-09-07 01:40:25,inuyf5,haha sorry for the discord at your house but that's adorable energy
5980,2020-09-07 01:56:11,inuyf5,"and another thing to add, NONE of the remaining teams are going to be playing like it doesnt matter. They've all been away from family and friends for weeks now. They aren't gonna roll over and die cause they wanna go home."

5988,2020-09-07 00:51:21,inuyf5,The Knights have been playing a lot of hockey days off for the protest. I think this fatigue based. It's not much but the stars got an extra couple of hours of rest.
5989,2020-09-07 01:26:23,inuyf5,Fatigue
5990,2020-09-07 01:27:03,inuyf5,I guess that’s what we learned from playing Vancouver.
5991,2020-09-07 02:10:18,inuyf5,Always feels like a good omen when Panic plays. I just want more
5992,2020-09-07 02:11:33,inuyf5,Anything but Imagine Dragons.
5993,2020-09-07 01:55:01,inuyf5,be the change you wanna see cheesecake
5994,2020-09-07 01:54:36,inuyf5,Maybe everyone is a bit too busy jammin it up themselves.

5998,2020-09-07 00:29:27,inuyf5,I'm feeling that vibe too 😪
5999,2020-09-07 00:39:03,inuyf5,Agreed. I imagine as the game progresses we will start to look like ourselves again and take control.
6000,2020-09-07 00:34:32,inuyf5,🙌
6001,2020-09-07 00:40:00,inuyf5,Making a literal hit list.
6002,2020-09-07 00:49:33,inuyf5,Got some knee on knee.
6003,2020-09-07 00:49:43,inuyf5,Knee on knee
6004,2020-09-07 00:50:35,inuyf5,He’s fine. He was right next to the ref and was hoping they’d call a penalty if he embellished it a bit. He already looks fine and didn’t need medical. So just a cute little embellishment.
6005,2020-09-07 00:51:57,inuyf5,Hes tiny and theyre big.
6006,2020-09-07 00:52:07,inuyf5,Oh shit I blinked and missed it
6007,2020-09-07 00:56:53,inuyf5,*ouch.*
6008,2020-09-07 01:46:25,inuyf5,except its to the chest of defenders in the neutral zone
6009,2020-09-07 01:53:25,inuyf5,Let’s goooo Wild Bill!!  Come out shooting in the 3rd!
6010,2020-09-07 01:49:23,inuyf5,Lmaoooooo
6011,2020-09-07 02:02:17,inuyf5,yes
6012,2020-09-07 02:01:55,inuyf5,Yep
6013,2020-09-07 02:02:07,inuyf5,"Both, actually. Can’t get past neutral zone"
6014,2020-09-07 02:01:34,inuyf5,Trash passings
6015,2020-09-07 02:01:53,inuyf5,Started bad. Then soso and now godmode (hopefully)
6016,2020-09-07 01:15:34,inuyf5,Agreed.  If I'm Pete going into the second I am preaching that Khudo is not Demko. Square up and shoot
6017,2020-09-07 01:15:37,inuyf5,"Zero sympathy or patience for him. 

You want to start? Then play better"
6018,2020-09-07 01:51:19,inuyf5,Only been really into hockey 3 years now. What makes that penalty NOT a shot?
6019,2020-09-07 01:32:32,inuyf5,i added a little sugar to go with it.
6020,2020-09-07 01:31:11,inuyf5,I got gold three days ago. Go gold!
6021,2020-09-07 01:35:06,inuyf5,I hope so yo!!!🤞
6022,2020-09-07 00:01:58,inuyf5,Sick ‘me where the jam goes
6023,2020-09-06 23:59:27,inuyf5,Car dealerships and ambulance chasers are the lifeblood of local sports
6024,2020-09-07 00:19:54,inuyf5,It’s what we need in this series!
6025,2020-09-07 00:36:16,inuyf5,And... he’s back
6026,2020-09-07 00:36:15,inuyf5,Hes back
6027,2020-09-07 00:44:36,inuyf5,little bit yeah
6028,2020-09-07 01:10:11,inuyf5,I refuse to believe Glass is older than 16
6029,2020-09-07 01:34:55,inuyf5,Let's not be Canucks 2.0
6030,2020-09-07 01:29:02,inuyf5,"Chirp back, assert dominance"
6031,2020-09-07 01:29:04,inuyf5,It’s chirping the stars too
6032,2020-09-07 01:30:04,inuyf5,If you light it on fire it will scream.
6033,2020-09-07 01:35:57,inuyf5,I just want Glass to be able to play AT ALL frankly and not have like severe post-concussion syndrome
6034,2020-09-07 01:35:09,inuyf5,*ouch* but you're not wrong
6035,2020-09-07 01:51:44,inuyf5,We’ve had about 40 of those this game
6036,2020-09-07 02:27:06,inuyf5,Dallas are elite at cutting off passing lanes which forces bad passes to be made.
6037,2020-09-07 02:39:47,inuyf5,Fleury still saved 96% of shots this game. The loss definitely wasn’t his fault. But DeBeor definitely prefers Lehner. So we will definitely see him for a while. Our offense lost the game.
6038,2020-09-07 02:38:28,inuyf5,Well hes clearly the main guy. So everytime he tired robin time
6039,2020-09-07 00:13:19,inuyf5,Congrats on your engagement tho!
6040,2020-09-07 01:51:25,inuyf5,Big dick energy is real bruh 😂😂😂

6044,2020-09-07 02:28:48,inuyf5,I was really rooting for you guys yesterday! So sorry you guys are out :(
6045,2020-09-07 02:23:47,inuyf5,Orange team good.
6046,2020-09-07 02:27:33,inuyf5,"Much better. But still, feels like you could make a blooper reel with all the shit that’s happened with this team tonight"
6047,2020-09-07 00:13:48,inuyf5,Mute buttons are the greatest invention of our time.
6048,2020-09-07 00:17:53,inuyf5,I’m fairly still new to hockey. What did he do?
6049,2020-09-07 00:49:07,inuyf5,I second that! It *would* be cool rn :-)
6050,2020-09-07 00:50:26,inuyf5,Definitely tired.

6061,2020-09-07 01:18:00,inuyf5,I’m about to make popcorn. I ate popcorn each game we won last series. During the second period.
6062,2020-09-07 01:28:55,inuyf5,That'll work.
6063,2020-09-07 01:53:13,inuyf5,Only positive I can find is we lost game one of the WCF 2 years ago and then shut down the jets next 4 games
6064,2020-09-07 02:01:25,inuyf5,he does post in /r/FortniteCompetitive to be fair
6065,2020-09-07 02:01:00,inuyf5,Wait why?
6066,2020-09-07 02:14:09,inuyf5,Females love that shit
6067,2020-09-07 02:23:34,inuyf5,Yeah. After tripping over himself. Then he got up and skated straight into Schmidt.
6068,2020-09-07 01:25:26,inuyf5,in the workplace microwave.
6069,2020-09-07 01:34:09,inuyf5,Love to see it
6070,2020-09-07 01:55:53,inuyf5,We should thank something other than stars.
6071,2020-09-07 02:19:00,inuyf5,It’s really starting to look that way.
6072,2020-09-07 02:18:46,inuyf5,Yes
6073,2020-09-07 02:19:08,inuyf5,Let's let the canucks sign him to big long term money first before we declare our offense cold.
6074,2020-09-07 02:39:20,inuyf5,Everyone one of them seemed gassed af from the start
6075,2020-09-07 00:37:08,inuyf5,"That's why when people with no emotional investment in the team look at the goalie situation, they all agree that Lehner is the better goalie. His strength is his positioning."
6076,2020-09-07 00:37:49,inuyf5,Right?! I noticed it in his last start.

6081,2020-09-07 02:27:55,inuyf5,but none of them are really quality shorts/chances. it was the same shit against demko. a bunch of bad/mediocre shots.
6082,2020-09-07 02:26:07,inuyf5,A little too late

6086,2020-09-07 00:38:19,inuyf5,Did you watch the Avs v Stars series? This is who the Stars are. If they can get away with it they will try to all day long.
6087,2020-09-07 01:09:12,inuyf5,"I just like hockey and games, ya know?"
6088,2020-09-07 01:50:53,inuyf5,That's the nice way of putting it. Lookin' like straight ass is how I'd describe it.
6089,2020-09-07 01:50:10,inuyf5,That’s an understatement. This team looks like they should’ve been bounced in round 1 the way they’re playing
6090,2020-09-07 02:18:36,inuyf5,This. He wasn’t stacking up blocks. We were feeding him saves.

6125,2020-09-07 02:17:48,inuyf5,Honestly I’d say Theos stick randomly breaking would be a better example
6126,2020-09-07 02:30:26,inuyf5,We are playing the best defensive team left in the playoffs lol.
6127,2020-09-07 02:38:05,inuyf5,This is what the stars do in the 3rd
6128,2020-09-07 02:52:55,inuyf5,Yea but now we are chasing the lead making it harder to come back
6129,2020-09-07 02:44:47,inuyf5,They purposefully were shutting him down. Theyre keyed onto our best guys.
6130,2020-09-07 01:53:11,inuyf5,You’d think there wasn’t an entire period of hockey left. The Negative Nancy’s tonight are in full force tonight.
6131,2020-09-07 01:54:06,inuyf5,This normally positive sub has turned toxic fast the last few games.

6133,2020-09-07 00:55:11,inuyf5,He’s been playing really well after being the sole starter when Bishop got hurt. Especially when Bishop came back and wasn’t ready for it at all
6134,2020-09-07 01:22:14,inuyf5,You see VGK went on the PP and we can’t have that. Note the DAL penalty was essentially a mandatory call

6149,2020-09-07 01:50:39,inuyf5,I have never seen the knights play so sloppy.. it’s like the entire team but tuch and whitecloud is hungover
6150,2020-09-07 02:01:29,inuyf5,I concur.

6156,2020-09-06 23:47:02,inuyf5,He is likely cousins takes his spot this game or swap him and nosek
6157,2020-09-07 00:05:09,inuyf5,Bishop’s been out all playoffs pretty much and was terrible in the one game he played. Khudobin might as well be their starter at this point
6158,2020-09-07 00:07:00,inuyf5,yeah.  Khudobin has been in net.  bishop has been beat up

6165,2020-09-07 00:53:42,inuyf5,Its the team seed.
6166,2020-09-07 00:54:01,inuyf5,the seed
6167,2020-09-07 00:53:39,inuyf5,Theyre the 3rd seed and we are the one seed for the playoffs I believe.
6168,2020-09-07 02:37:34,inuyf5,Vegas committee seppuku too. That’s probably why.
6169,2020-09-07 01:53:00,inuyf5,Because 🦓
6170,2020-09-07 01:58:32,inuyf5,"to be fair, it was super funny when Katherine said during the last game it was a ""Great goalie duel"" when the Canucks had less than 8 SOG during the second intermission."
6171,2020-09-07 01:58:47,inuyf5,"For real. Fluery is basically keeping us in the game and they're talking about

""[Dallas] hasn't had to face many shots, but he's looked great!"""
6172,2020-09-07 02:00:15,inuyf5,"Stormy and McKenna are on Fortress at home on YouTube. 

Edit to say that’s maybe not what you’re looking for, but if you’re lookin for a better intermission experience, that might help."
6173,2020-09-07 02:25:30,inuyf5,Then we win in 5 :)))
6174,2020-09-07 02:26:23,inuyf5,Its like it can take a moment to adjust to a different team 🤔

6176,2020-09-07 00:51:02,inuyf5,I dont hate them theyre just clearly a lot better than us.
6177,2020-09-07 01:27:39,inuyf5,"Yeah, trying to make highlight plays every game isn't necessary. Just play finally sound and the highlight reel stuff will naturally come."
6178,2020-09-07 01:28:06,inuyf5,Long change this period. He probably got stuck out there during the 4v4 time.
6179,2020-09-07 01:34:41,inuyf5,KEEP IT THE FUCK UP
6180,2020-09-07 02:00:59,inuyf5,Better passing and be more physical. I can't even count how many times the puck has jumped a stick at the blue line and resulted in us losing offensive position.
6181,2020-09-07 02:01:41,inuyf5,"Be more careful exiting and don’t make “hope” passes.  Wake up and play knights’ hockey, in the O zone.  And shoot at the pads not the chest"
6182,2020-09-07 02:02:01,inuyf5,"They need to take more shots and stop passing across ice and looking for the open guy, in my opinion.

We're being bodied. Those looks aren't there. We need to try to get a redirect or a second chance by getting bodies in front of the goalie and getting the puck at the net because we just get tied up along the wall.

And also, just play better defense. Lol."
6183,2020-09-07 01:58:21,inuyf5,Be a lot more physical than them and shoot like crazy probably
6184,2020-09-07 01:58:57,inuyf5,"Make the Stars net 6"" bigger on all 3 sides."
6185,2020-09-07 01:59:33,inuyf5,The tried and true “Shoot the puck!!!!”
6186,2020-09-07 02:00:17,inuyf5,Honestly if we just stop giving the puck away on missed passes and bad clears it wod go a long way to changing the momentum.
6187,2020-09-07 02:05:04,inuyf5,You username always gets me...
6188,2020-09-07 02:06:05,inuyf5,I second that! Would take the 10 hour drive from NM to drink beers and watch hockey with redditors.

6190,2020-09-07 02:36:33,inuyf5,That's what Dallas give you. Avs series was the same.

6192,2020-09-07 02:32:04,inuyf5,He unfortunately probably would have whiffed it
6193,2020-09-07 00:07:43,inuyf5,"Vgk has the ""home"" spot today, so they get the fancy room"
6194,2020-09-07 00:08:15,inuyf5,"I think because Vegas is the ""home"" team for this game, they get the Oilers' locker room at Rogers Place, which is obviously nicer"
6195,2020-09-07 00:08:15,inuyf5,It’s home vs away locker rooms they’re typically like that
6196,2020-09-07 00:09:10,inuyf5,"lol yea, Ive been noticing that since the start of the bubble. One of the perks if winning the #1 seed"
6197,2020-09-07 01:03:17,inuyf5,This is almost as good as u/stastnygetnasty ‘s “your mom” burn
6198,2020-09-07 00:24:21,inuyf5,"Fleury was so far from the net, too. If the pass had connected they would've scored."
6199,2020-09-07 01:34:46,inuyf5,We have less than 10 shots on goal what do you want them to say? Dallas is better right now.
6200,2020-09-07 01:37:17,inuyf5,What happened now?
6201,2020-09-07 01:39:28,inuyf5,I refuse to pay any attention to the NFL until the NHL is over. But thats just me. I'm weird.
6202,2020-09-07 00:30:08,inuyf5,Someone help this man get it out of his back
6203,2020-09-07 00:31:45,inuyf5,We all do
6204,2020-09-07 00:38:08,inuyf5,Yes and yes.

6208,2020-09-07 01:16:38,inuyf5,I just have strawberries. And jam.
6209,2020-09-07 01:18:42,inuyf5,"I think there's a media guide that they have for every game that lists match-up statistics, player bios and stats, etc. You can sometimes find them on eBay."
6210,2020-09-07 01:19:18,inuyf5,The 8 icings in the first period would support that.
6211,2020-09-07 01:19:35,inuyf5,Everything looks terrible tbh
6212,2020-09-07 01:21:27,inuyf5,My feed must be way behind lol
6213,2020-09-07 01:35:25,inuyf5,Having problems getting it out of our zone too
6214,2020-09-07 01:35:42,inuyf5,That was soft as fuck
6215,2020-09-07 02:04:26,inuyf5,"Nah, Emile Hirsch is doing just fine"
6216,2020-09-07 02:20:33,inuyf5,Cause that's our PP strategy
6217,2020-09-07 00:23:40,inuyf5,"Lehner played 3 games in 4 days, todays a breather day for him"
6218,2020-09-07 00:23:37,inuyf5,Probably just giving Panda some rest honestly
6219,2020-09-07 00:27:20,inuyf5,"I like the hopeful thinking, but Lehner did main 2 series. It seems like PDB is treating flower like a backup"
6220,2020-09-07 00:23:54,inuyf5,I hope so
6221,2020-09-07 00:56:04,inuyf5,Its more that Dallas plays really good in their own zone and cuts off the shooting lanes. They pack the front of the net.
6222,2020-09-07 00:55:24,inuyf5,The latter.
6223,2020-09-07 00:56:00,inuyf5,yes
6224,2020-09-07 00:57:26,inuyf5,We’ve always had finish problems.  The comeback games have been so heartening esp cuz they’ve been multi goal wins.  Hopefully we find our way back to it across these next two series!
6225,2020-09-07 01:05:27,inuyf5,you might as well spit in his face and tell him he has a small dick.
6226,2020-09-07 01:06:05,inuyf5,"Don’t be afraid of the dark side, I’m available if you have any questions"
6227,2020-09-07 01:20:47,inuyf5,Oh yeah same. I was wondering who they’d pick. Since they’d been riding the Vancouver and Colorado train hard before
6228,2020-09-07 02:01:33,inuyf5,I'm gonna get really drunk.
6229,2020-09-07 01:59:40,inuyf5,shitposting with my left hand instead of my right.
6230,2020-09-07 02:02:59,inuyf5,Nothing. I've been channeling optimism all night and I've got faith our boys have got this. Just gonna keep doing my playoff success ritual
6231,2020-09-07 01:58:28,inuyf5,I already took off my pants
6232,2020-09-07 01:58:33,inuyf5,Take off my underwear?
6233,2020-09-07 02:04:06,inuyf5,gotta get someone to water their lawn during off hours
6234,2020-09-07 02:03:06,inuyf5,but not to the head. That's a 5 minute major and game misconduct with a suspension.

Eh, I guess let’s talk about Dallas."

6237,2020-09-07 00:19:02,inuyf5,It’s flower power time!
6238,2020-09-07 00:19:45,inuyf5,You want Lehner playing 3 games in 4 nights in the conference final?
6239,2020-09-07 00:31:32,inuyf5,"that's even funnier because I know you meant boogers but bugger is ""faggot"" in British"
6240,2020-09-07 00:31:42,inuyf5,Can confirm heard it from an anonymous source.
6241,2020-09-07 02:33:12,inuyf5,And yet it's not wrong. We've had some serious scoring troubles since Game 4 of last series.
6242,2020-09-07 00:05:04,inuyf5,Cause why not? It's a benefit of having two top notch goalies.
6243,2020-09-07 00:06:43,inuyf5,"Most likely to give Lehner some rest. He had all but one game last series, including the both if the back to back at the end."
6244,2020-09-07 00:05:27,inuyf5,"lehner is probably tired after 3 starts in 4 nights.  start fleury, get robin a couple extra days of rest"
6245,2020-09-07 00:06:14,inuyf5,"I have a feeling it’s to get Lehner rested as b2b in high pressure games is tiring, while also keeping fleury active for if Lehner stops performing"
6246,2020-09-07 00:06:18,inuyf5,Panda played 3 games in 4 days. Letting him rest.
6247,2020-09-07 00:05:31,inuyf5,My guess....least important game of the series and Lehner needs a break.
6248,2020-09-07 00:05:36,inuyf5,Rest lehner one game? Thats the whole point of having two great goalies
6249,2020-09-07 00:04:58,inuyf5,Lehners gotta be tired after his B2B
6250,2020-09-07 00:11:44,inuyf5,"Nah, Dobby’s more of a 1B than a backup. I say the curse doesn’t apply."
6251,2020-09-07 00:10:37,inuyf5,No
6252,2020-09-07 00:32:01,inuyf5,what are arena points? it looks like a video game thing?
6253,2020-09-07 00:55:56,inuyf5,I think Khudobin got his skate to that to kick it sideways just a bit.
6254,2020-09-07 01:17:03,inuyf5,Fuck the Houston Asterisks.
6255,2020-09-07 01:17:12,inuyf5,Oh yeah I fucking do.
6256,2020-09-07 01:35:59,inuyf5,"I like kenny. Looks kind of weird, but solid play by play announcer."
6257,2020-09-07 01:40:59,inuyf5,Right now that should be Carrier. He's always been our Reaves fill-in.
6258,2020-09-07 01:45:12,inuyf5,Can't shoot if you never have the puck in the O zone.
6259,2020-09-07 01:45:57,inuyf5,Its not great to have fewer shots but it was either game 5 or game 6 against the Nucks that we outshot them by like 20 and still lost.
6260,2020-09-07 02:14:15,inuyf5,Dobby from harry potter
6261,2020-09-07 02:14:26,inuyf5,Doby from Harry Potter
6262,2020-09-07 02:14:25,inuyf5,Dobby
6263,2020-09-07 02:14:40,inuyf5,Dobby
6264,2020-09-07 02:15:07,inuyf5,Says Dobby across the bottom of the mask. He's a good elf.
6265,2020-09-07 02:17:04,inuyf5,We need full commitment here!
6266,2020-09-07 02:18:43,inuyf5,I give lessons btw
6267,2020-09-07 00:38:22,inuyf5,"If it gets these clowns to shut up about the better goalie playing playoff games, im in."
6268,2020-09-07 01:46:12,inuyf5,Theodore will have to bail us out again...calling it now
6269,2020-09-07 01:46:32,inuyf5,We came back in the third period. I think.
6270,2020-09-07 01:46:44,inuyf5,Third period magic
6271,2020-09-07 01:47:23,inuyf5,This is a result of us being tired more than them being that good.
6272,2020-09-07 01:57:28,inuyf5,"The round robin was a joke, there may have been some strategy involved. Realistically teams had no reason to go hard in the round robin."
6273,2020-09-07 00:59:14,inuyf5,"They also didn’t have a game 6 to game 7 back to back as we have, and I think it’s more that then the 5 hours. 

Regardless, nobody is interested in excuses in the Conference Finals."
6274,2020-09-07 02:34:02,inuyf5,It’s like they’re waiting for the puck to come to them. They can’t *all* be on a NyQuil/DayQuil daze...
6275,2020-09-07 02:33:37,inuyf5,The knights have looked terrible. Stars are looking ok. The one goal was weak af and the game should be 0-0. Vegas is keeping up while playing their worst game of the postseason
6276,2020-09-07 00:48:52,inuyf5,Looked clean
6277,2020-09-07 01:36:26,inuyf5,/u/scottyfoxy obviously

6281,2020-09-07 00:58:51,inuyf5,"Why does every fanbase feel this way? Man, I hear this all the time in football, baseball, whatever. Commentators have been fine, imo: they've been pretty fair and open with how sloppy VGK looks."
6282,2020-09-07 00:58:34,inuyf5,In general they praise the team that is winning.
6283,2020-09-07 00:57:56,inuyf5,I had to switch to the away feed. NBC was just gargling Dallas's balls a bit too much for me to handle
6284,2020-09-07 01:51:43,inuyf5,Dallas is just capitalizing on us being tired. We're making them look amazing by passing it right to their players.
6285,2020-09-07 01:50:11,inuyf5,they cant all be Demko's
6286,2020-09-07 02:07:20,inuyf5,Hague has a lot of holes in his game and throwing him into the fire now isn't smart. Engelland is old and slow and the problem is we are getting outskated.
6287,2020-09-07 02:08:56,inuyf5,When McNabb has a good game he's great. He showed that in game 7
6288,2020-09-07 00:20:18,inuyf5,"Cousins, methinks"
6289,2020-09-07 00:20:28,inuyf5,"Cousins, on the 4th line"

6294,2020-09-07 02:00:59,inuyf5,?
6295,2020-09-07 02:41:26,inuyf5,How was this the refs fault?
6296,2020-09-07 02:42:17,inuyf5,Not sure we can blame the refs on this one. We have to look at our offense.
6297,2020-09-07 01:32:45,inuyf5,Who cares. You're not focusing.
6298,2020-09-07 01:32:16,inuyf5,One of my best friends is a small streamer hes really the only person I watch on Twitch and I just give him my prime sub every month lol. I sometimes watch Doc but not often and hes not with Twitch anymore.

6304,2020-09-07 02:00:41,inuyf5,"Like we are tired. All things considered, its nothing to worry about yet."
6305,2020-09-07 02:01:14,inuyf5,"They are giving us no time or space.  For our part, we can't make an accurate pass to save our lives and we're skating on sand."
6306,2020-09-07 01:14:26,inuyf5,do you wanna mention Lehner's up for a contract with that or....

6315,2020-09-06 23:37:31,inuyf5,"I can understand that. I’m a bit surprised to be honest, but it’s good that we can get Fleury a game here or there in case we need to rely on him."
6316,2020-09-07 02:33:59,inuyf5,Gossip gurrrrrl

6319,2020-09-07 00:41:40,inuyf5,And we can’t panic as a fan base either. It’s barely the first period of the first game in the series
6320,2020-09-07 00:51:21,inuyf5,2020's all fucked up isn't it?
6321,2020-09-07 02:04:33,inuyf5,Hes in the *lifestyle*

6323,2020-09-07 06:05:31,inuyf5,"""my wife's boyfriend"" quips are just a meme.

There is zero percent chance anyone ever dates me again, haha. I'm too old and too poor to even care these days."

6327,2020-09-07 02:07:53,inuyf5,I was thinking Darcy Kuemper. That friggin sasquatch in net is impossible to score on sometimes.
6328,2020-09-07 02:31:48,inuyf5,Ahhh I dunno
6329,2020-09-07 00:48:46,inuyf5,They were. We figured out that we could only win when we played physical back. Get ready for Perry to dive and draw penalties all series. Infuriating.
6330,2020-09-06 23:21:58,inuyf5,"He went 3/4 last round. Had the Flyers over the Islanders. OP suspects his dog just doesn't like the Islanders crochet toy, haha"
6331,2020-09-06 23:20:02,inuyf5,3/4 for the series last round

6333,2020-09-07 16:06:53,inuyf5,We’ve got a lot of major streets in Vegas. Shit it’s all 45/55 mph 3 lane roads from the North to South and East to West. You could social distance the crowd using just Pecos/St Rose.
6334,2020-09-07 00:19:53,inuyf5,minnesota has not been Vegas' best opponent this year.

6339,2020-09-07 01:05:37,inuyf5,We're gonna need more from you next period and the rest of the game.
6340,2020-09-07 01:08:06,inuyf5,"Lol, just trying keep positive vibes going. All happy beeps over here."

6345,2020-09-07 01:18:29,inuyf5,"By far the most pain I've been in in my whole life.

That being said, after 2 days I'm forgetting about how painful it was and debating doing my other knee."
6346,2020-09-07 00:27:10,inuyf5,Tell that to the guy that was throwing an all out bitch fit in here about him a week or so ago. I think we may have chased him off finally lol
6347,2020-09-07 02:01:47,inuyf5,Not to mention that every team left thinks that they have what it takes to win the cup now that they have won at least two series.

6349,2020-09-07 00:49:29,inuyf5,"Agreed. Obviously would be nice to score before the horn, but the way they're playing right now I'm not seeing it. Need to get into the locker room and regroup"

6514,2020-09-06 22:11:09,intwiq,"Love this. Only thing I disagree with is saying OSP v Smith makes no sense. I think it makes a lot of sense actually. OSP is on a 2 fight win streak at LHW against hyped up prospects in Oleksiejczuk and Menifield. He finished both and I mean realistically, he's only lost to dudes who are top 10 fights in the 205 lb division. Smith is coming off two REALLLY bad losses and has shown that he's probably not the top 5 fighter everybody thought. If he can beat a guy like OSP, it will show that he belongs somewhere in the 8-12 position. But if he loses, it'll show that he probably isn't even top 10, MAYBE top 15 material. OSP is due for a step up, Smith is due for a step down."

6517,2020-09-06 21:32:21,intwiq,I really like Jiri/Rumble. Somebody's going to sleep and I think it'd probably be Jiri unfortunately but damn would that be must watch TV. I also think considering the fact Jiri will be #5 if not #4 by the time the fight happened they could shoehorn Rumble into a title shot off it if they wanted to off a KO.

You seem to have diverse tastes (so would likely be happy with anything you set your sights on), you do have two of my favorites listed  


* Pumpkin 26 - a very different type of gourmand, less edible than it sounds. Gooey pumpkin marshmallows and their crystalline note. 


* Vampire Bourbon Patchouli Bat - a sultry patchouli, demure bourbon, smooth backdrop of sweetness."
6543,2020-09-06 21:19:38,inss53,"There is a Facebook group I just discovered called “house of NA tent” 
And it’s been saving my life right now lol. 

You can search in the group for reviews of anything that’s been out before, and lots of current comments on this release in there~ it’s a very active and nice group."
6544,2020-09-06 20:56:52,inss53,"I have never ordered from NAVA before so can't offer anything in terms of review or practical advice. But I can tell you that NAVA's TAT is **5-10 business days**. Adding in time for Ajevie to receive, decant and ship out, I would think that still leaves time for you to sample and make decisions on whether or not you'd like to full size any of the Halloween goods. Of course I defer to anyone else who has first hand experience here, but I think you're ok!

As for which scents were released before this year, those are all the perfumes listed under [Resurgence](https://nocturnealchemy.com/collections/limited-collection/products/new-halloween-resurgence-limited-collection). So everything from the [2020 Limited Collection](https://nocturnealchemy.com/collections/limited-collection/products/new-halloween-2020-limited-collection) is completely new. Hopefully people can help review resurgence scents you're interested in!"
6545,2020-09-06 22:14:28,inss53,"So I don't have any real input on the actual scents, but I had a similar problem narrowing down and we have some similar items on our list! I made a list of all the ones I wanted (it was like 25 lol) and I took off ones that had notes similar to samples or other full sizes I already have. I only allowed myself to buy samples of things that were very unique or had notes I have never tried before.

I Full Sized'd **Meow. Purr. Booo.** There is a ""spooky kitten kisses note."" I had no choice. I also FS'd the **2021 Halloween LE**. There is no way that combination of notes isn't going to be amazing, and I'm very curious how ALL THOSE NOTES are going to blend and dance together.

I got the following Ajevie Samples, and the ""new/interesting notes/accords"" for me are in paraenthesis. Tiki Zombie, Count Coconut and Owl-oween had to get the axe, although I am positive they are absolutely lovely.

Sugar Penguin (Peppermint Spun Sugar)

Salty Old Doubloons (Salt accord, Condensed Milk)

Haunted by the Past (Saffron, Pumpkin Pie Cheesecake, Haunted Mansion dust ^(?!?!?!?!?!))

Blood and Milkshakes (Kashmir Red Musk)

CANOPIC Hapy Dark (Charred Ginger)

Spook Show (Cream Soda Accord, Black Cherry Skin)

Vampire Bourbon Patchouli Bat (Got this to see what all the hype is about, Vanilla Wax accord)

Candy Corn Cotton Candy (Cotton Candy accord)

Pumpkin 26 (Got this to see what all the hype is about)"
6546,2020-09-06 20:53:43,inss53,"I know 😭😭😭

These are the ones i narrowed down from like 35. Its not fair!! Im sorry if I have corrupted you lol. Octopoda potion is reeeeally calling to me because nava does chocolate SO GOOD. Black diamond is AMAZING. It might help that their cinnamon note makes a fragrance go red hots on my skin so at least theres that..."
6547,2020-09-06 21:04:19,inss53,Shhheeeeiiittt. I really wanted pumpkin 26 and vamp bourbon patchouli bat sounds soooo up my alley. Mortal coil though sounds sooo good. So maybe I have to get like 3 or 4 of what i really want from resurgence then some ajevie samples for the others?  I was just worried about the time frame and didnt take into consideration limited stock. Thank you!
6548,2020-09-06 22:22:46,inss53,"I totally forgot I'm a member! Thanks for reminding me, i never go on Facebook lol"
6549,2020-09-06 22:21:46,inss53,Yea its been hard to narrow stuff down. Fall releases will be the death of me! Or my account balance....

6574,2020-09-06 18:20:14,inqnry,"Freesm was one of my favorite nugu releases last year. The instrumental is constantly adding new textures and some of them are kind of uncommon for kpop, which I always appreciate! 

As someone who's always hunting down the 80s inspired retro songs that have been popping up, I can't believe I hadn't heard Maemmaeya before. It's a tiny bit too cutesy/overall higher pitched for me to listen to super often (although maybe that's just my geriatric phone speakers, I'll have to listen again on something better) which is a shame cause it's pretty catchy and the mv gives me major Orange Caramel vibes."
6575,2020-09-06 18:29:51,inqnry,"I actually really love Freesm but I haven’t gotten around to listen to any of Hashtag’s other songs. These posts always encourage me to look more into groups I didn’t even know about, even if I’ve heard a song or two by them."
6576,2020-09-06 18:32:05,inqnry,"\#Aeji #paSsion was one of my favorite mini albums last year.  Freesm was great, and 안녕이밤 is a fantastic album closer."
6577,2020-09-06 19:38:58,inqnry,"Hashtag has some pretty interesting releases - their Purple subunit release ""Maemmaeya"" is my favorite (though the vocals are a little too cutesy, kind of like Cherry Bullet's Aloha Oe). It feels authentically 80s in a way that some songs fail to do. Sojin's hashtag being #Cranky made me laugh when I read it. For Freesm's credits, maybe ""Dajung"" is Dajeong herself?

Aalia's music is chill but engaging in a way I don't expect from most k-ballads. ""My Blue Moon"" is going on my studying playlist.

Upbeat boygroup songs tend to be hit or miss for me, but I really enjoyed VX's ""What You""! Overall, it's my favorite song from this roundup. Thank you for your consistent hard work and giveaways!"
6578,2020-09-06 19:48:54,inqnry,"The Maemmaeya MV is super cute, gives me a bit of Bboom Bboom vibes. Although I am still cringing at ""white Seolhyun"", colorism at its finest 😬"
6579,2020-09-06 22:21:18,inqnry,"Tbh, I thought Hashtag was disbanded so I hadn’t paid much attention to them, but I’m glad to know they aren’t. I like happy songs so Hue is really nice, I may even add it to my playlist. Thank you for doing these every week!"
6580,2020-09-06 20:04:16,inqnry,"I think my favorite song from this roundup would be VX's ""What You"". There's something fun about the song, it just makes me want to get up and bust a move"
6581,2020-09-06 23:49:12,inqnry,"Haven't checked out Hashtag before, but Freesm sounds super interesting and unique. Not all of their songs work for me on first listen, but this one is cool. It sounds so elegant!

And from Aalia I'll definitely remember her chill and minimalistic songs like Odiya? and The Night without You, as I really like to listen to that style of music while learning"
6582,2020-09-07 22:49:02,inqnry,"Freesm is definitely is my favorite. The rap & choreo got me hooked. Hashtag have something I look for in GGs. I hope to see more of their work

Thanks for letting me know about AALIA. She is really good. 


Thanks for GAs. I appreciate your work."
6583,2020-09-08 16:12:04,inqnry,"I remember randomly coming across HASHTAG during their appearance on a radio show where they performed Freesm live, and it has been my favorite song of theirs ever since. I really hope they can make a comeback soon! 

Thanks for another great roundup!"
6584,2020-09-13 10:24:24,inqnry,"All of those recommendations are so good, thank you so much, OP, I ought to check those round-ups more often. I had heard of Hashtag before (and I really liked Passion, despite the fact that quite often, I'm not the biggest fan of such songs), but I hadn't managed to check them out beyond that. Honestly? I'm pleasantly surprised, Hue particularly is super nice and they've certainly made a spot for themselves in my favourite nugu groups list, they're great! Aalia and VX are so cool as well, thank you once again!"
6585,2020-09-06 22:58:17,inqnry,"Wow, Aalia's releases are right up my alley - especially Maybe I was Wrong!"
6586,2020-09-07 05:15:31,inqnry,"Oo I didn't know that Hashtag is still active. I thought they quietly disbanded as it's been a while since their comeback. They were actually the very first ""nugu"" group I was exposed to through Freesm which I loved. I feel like if it was released by a bigger group it would have been big."
6587,2020-09-07 05:54:24,inqnry,"Hashtag is pretty cool -- ""hue"" is an interesting English title though. I liked My Style too and has some nice transitions up its sleeve. 

I have a copy of the Hide & Seek album and was surprised at how big it was lol [opting-out]"
6588,2020-09-09 00:09:15,inqnry,"As a fan of upbeat songs, my favorite was VX OMG. They have a really great buildup for the first chorus, so many new tracks added during the song and they were really energetic and had swag during the live stage, good vocals as well. Really sad that the group didn't work out, and some of the guys didn't even have another chance."
6589,2020-09-09 00:23:46,inqnry,"I loved Hashtag's Freesm live stage. The contrast between the high tones and Dajeong's low voice, especially during the chorus, was really good. And they have a nice choreo as well. Will check more of them because Dajeong caught my attention"
6590,2020-09-07 00:22:51,inqnry,"Whoah, Hashtag - Freesm was pretty dope. Another MIO song in the playlist. These posts are so great. Solid effort!"
6591,2020-09-07 08:57:09,inqnry,"These VX guys were really talented. What You? Is a bop and a half! Shame it didn't work out....

But HASHTAG are so great! I took me ages to figure out that Purple was a subunit of theirs and they really show a lot of versality. I hope COVID doesn't kill off their agency though"
6592,2020-09-08 06:16:48,inqnry,I really liked hue and my style. It was always hard to find them on youtube because whenever I searched them it would result in videos with #kpop.
6593,2020-09-07 05:02:08,inqnry,Thank you so much
6594,2020-09-06 18:49:30,inqnry,"It's a solid mini all the way through.  Love Game is a Space One track, who was formerly known as Janghyun of Sunny Hill back when they were a co-ed group.  I always love the stuff he writes."
6595,2020-09-06 21:58:26,inqnry,"You're right, it was Dajeong!  I missed it looking at a different translation but just checked on Melon and it was her, plus Sojin has a composition credit on that song as well, updated the post, thank you.

EDIT:  Aalia also has some very nice OST tracks.  I typically don’t post OSTs in the main post but if you like her music you should check them out."

6599,2020-09-06 23:51:59,inpswf,"Thank you for this! I know a lot of people are rightfully suspicious as ""free money"" sounds like an obvious scam, but it's not really ""free"" - it's your money being held until you pick it up, because those who owe it to you are simply not going to track you over cities and states to verify your identity and get it to you. It's much easier to throw it at the program and, unfortunately, it languishes there. Sometimes until after your death - and then a curious family member discovers you were owed thousands of dollars and they now have to jump through (expensive) legal hoops to claim it. Get it now."
6600,2020-09-06 23:41:29,inpswf,"Yeah, my partner almost threw mine away! If you aren't immediately expecting a check it looks like junk, and so many bullshit companies send fake checks. Have to be careful when inspecting your mail."

Lynch, Rawls, Carson are all it. Bruisers who run downhill between the tackles who always fight for extra yards and thats just not who penny is... unless penny changes his running style i find it hard to believe. But then again they for some reason drafted him in the 1st.."
6612,2020-09-06 18:30:14,inp25j,"Dunbar is going to have a lot to prove this season.  He came in pretty thin and hasn't had much time with the team.  If he is a big liability in run defense he's going to lose playing time. We'll see how it goes.

KJ will probably get some pretty good offers next off season.  Will be hard for him to stay.

I bet Shaquem is resigned in a few week for just under top CB money, and that he regrets that come seasons end.

Poona is probably fairly cheap for a starter on the defensive line, unless he just goes out and destroys this season

We probably end up tendering Mone.  I think he'll be eligible for that.  

Jackson may never play football again

Not sure about the O-Line guys depends how they feel in house.

Bruce Irvin can probably be had for about his current salary. Maybe they give him 2-3 15 million.

I think Mayowa is in for a solid 10 sack season.  He might see around 10 million next year.  If he's back here it's because we aren't confident in the young guys yet

Edit:  Chris Carson might be back fairly cheap 4-6 million a year. He has a history of fumbles and injuries.  Who knows with Hyde.

I think if Dorsett has a half decent season he's probably back for 1-2 million,  David Moore might depend as much on his own play as Josh Gordons.  David Moore is good enough that someone will give him more opportunities if not more money next year, assuming Josh Gordon is actually still around"

Who I think we should cut that’s not on that list: Reed

Other than that I think the vast majority of that list is gone next season since they’re all replaceable. I could maybe see them trying to keep one of the linemen like Pocic, but tbh none of those linemen are that good and worth a big contract"
6616,2020-09-06 17:00:56,inp25j,"Agree. I also think one of the O linemen have a chance of being resigned for cheap, esp pocic depending on how important he becomes. And (hopefully not) but perhaps Irvin or mayowa"
6617,2020-09-06 18:13:36,inp25j,If we let all of those other dudes go then literally the only guy on the roster who could play center would be Finney. It would seem Finney is better suited to guard as well.
6618,2020-09-07 00:27:15,inp25j,Not til after next season
6619,2020-09-07 00:30:26,inp25j,Cut reed? You're crazy. I don't want to eat 5 mil in dead cap
6620,2020-09-07 19:32:31,inp25j,My guess is that they’ll want to get it done before next season. They usually shoot for that time frame with their big money players.
6621,2020-09-07 00:51:59,inp25j,I thought if we cut him after this season we save cap space for next year? Basically if he doesn’t perform that well this year there’s not a huge loss

6648,2020-09-06 19:41:21,inos0o,Are the alpha's font from GMK Minimal? I'm designing a set like Minimal right now and reminded me of them
6649,2020-09-06 23:33:45,inos0o,"Minimal uses WS1 for the alpha color, this set uses 3K for the alpha color."
6650,2020-10-10 15:59:34,j8mb21,"I actually just got four schminke paints in the mail yesterday and had a chance to swatch them out and play around with them, and I really love them. I haven't had any issues with vibrancy or chalkiness - I did get potters pink, which I was already aware was not a vibrant colour, so it was a muted colour as expected. 

What colours have you got from schminke? Some pigments are naturally granulating, and that could be mistaken for chalkiness, and some are just naturally more muted. Viridian for example is one that people often buy and are disappointed with because genuine viridian is a very muted, granulating colour, and people buy it thinking it's going to be a vibrant green like phthalo green because a lot of student grade paints label phthalo green ""Viridian hue"" or even just ""virdidian"", giving novice watercolourists the wrong idea of what actual real viridian looks like. Cobalt violet is another one that's super muted and disappointing if you don't know what to expect from it. 

The peerless watercolours, I don't know a ton about to speak on them, but a lot of cheaper watercolours use dyes instead of pigments. I couldn't find any pigment information on them, but the fanciful names on most of the colours don't instill any confidence in me that they're using very lightfast pigments. Dye bases paints could make them less chalky on cheap paper, but also means it's quite possible they may have all the archival qualities of a gallon of milk. One site I saw said that they were designed to be able to use them on photo touchups on glossy paper, so they're definitely not made like traditional watercolours that would just bead up on glassy paper."
6651,2020-10-10 16:36:17,j8mb21,"I've used Daniel Smith, Schminke, Windsor and Newton, Rubelev, Art Spectrum and when I was starting out Cotman (the student version of Windsor and Newton). The artist quality paints are all much of a muchness - pretty similar except in some very subtle ways. Some of the same name colours are a little different across the different brands. For instance, I have two neutral tints on my pallete - a Windsor and Newton one and a Schminke one - because one tends more to purple and the other more to green.

I've really been enjoying using the Schminke colours myself, never had any problems with their vibrancy nor with any 'chalkiness'. The only problem I have with them is that their tubes are awful: they puncture easily, they are more flimsy and the labels often fall off."
6652,2020-10-10 17:51:34,j8mb21,"I use both Daniel Smith and Winsor and Newton paints on Canson paper with great success so far.

At the advice of a youtuber I enjoy, I tried the basic daniel smith set for $25.  You get 6 tubes, 5 mls.  Ive been very happy.

6656,2020-10-11 01:07:35,j8mb21,"you also don’t have to stick to a single brand. i’ve bought stuff from different brands here and there—started out with a cotman kit, and slowly grew a collection over time. i think it’s a mix windsor & newton pro, sennelier, holbein, and daniel smith. 

i know some people like to keep palettes limited to a single brand but i’ve never really run into issues with mixing. (except for the cotman set—i still use it for travel sometimes but i don’t really mix it with the nicer paints)."
6657,2020-10-11 06:25:50,j8mb21,"Sometimes it depends on the opacity of the colours you've chosen, as well as how much water you're using. Cadmiums are opaque, and don't always make for the most vibrant of mixes. Also consider the hues you're choosing. Cadmium yellow or a bright yellow mixed with a warm blue are going to make for a dull green. Also consider that watercolours tend to dry lighter than when they first go down, especially with a diluted wash. 

I have professional/artist grade paints from a few brands, Daniel Smith, Winsor and Newton, M. Graham, Sennelier, and Schmincke, and the vibrancy of the Schmincke Horadam stacks up with the rest."
6658,2020-10-10 16:26:40,j8mb21,"I use arches cold pressed 140lb paper and winsor & newton kolinsky brushes. So it's not a quality thing at play here. :)

Dye-based jives with how the peerless dissolve in water, I can see that. I haven't noticed them looking worse over time though. I guess time will tell.

For schmincke I have ultramarine blue, cobalt blue, prussian blue, quinacridone gold hue, burnt sienne, burnt umber, cadmium red middle, vermillion light, alizarin crimson, aureolin hue, lemon yellow, cadmium yellow medium, neutral tint, hooker's green, ivory black, lamp black, and chinese white. Not enough variety also not an issue here (aside from greens) :)"

6660,2020-10-10 16:27:40,j8mb21,Thanks! I might try that $25 set just to see how it compares.
6661,2020-10-10 20:22:03,j8mb21,Thank you for the compliment. And I do mix colors of course.
6662,2020-10-11 02:28:30,j8mb21,"It should be noted that the info on that link is 20 years old, and Schmincke have had at least one major overhaul of their Horadam line since."
6663,2020-10-10 17:28:09,j8mb21,"Those shouldn't be colours that are excessively muted, but I'm thinking perhaps the peerless just have some of the really vibrant colours that you're missing from your schminke collection - mainly the quinacridone reds and violets and the phthalo blues and greens. There's nothing wrong with your colour selections - they're very traditional colours. I can just see that if you were comparing that collection to a set that uses either dyes or includes some of the quinacridone magentas and reds and phthalo blue and phthalo green, which a lot of student grade or lower sets will include, you would definitely notice the lack of really vibrant colours in the schminke colours you have. 

The student sets want to make sure the vibrant colours are in there to make novice painters happy, and novice painters are less likely to be looking for the old reliable traditional colours - they just want bright colours. On the other hand, the more experienced painters might keep going back to what they know, and not want to experiment with some of the newer pigments available, or turn their noses up at them, even though they're fantastic, vibrant paints, and extremely lightfast. 

I'd try adding quinacridone magenta, pthalo blue, and phthalo green and see how those compare for vibrancy. Those are also highly transparent staining colours, while most of the schminke ones you've got are more granulating and opaque. One of my personal favourites is perylene maroon - I just tried Schminke's and it's frickin' gorgeous - like alizarin crimson but deeper and richer."
6664,2020-10-11 02:23:25,j8mb21,"Is it possible that the colours you got a from Schmincke's Akademie student line? Also, you can absolutely mix brands, that person was full of it."
6665,2020-10-10 18:06:50,j8mb21,"I do have phthalo blue actually, forgot to mention it. That and the ultramarine blue, the lemon yellow, and the alizarin crimson are the vibrant colors I'd say. You might have a point about getting more colors, but I'd rather try a different brand rather than invest more money here when the cheap paints are looking better.

Honestly the dullness of the color is less of a problem for me than how poorly it layers, notice how in the painting I posted that you can clearly see the full lighter layers below. And the hard hard edges (i did an especially poor job of preventing that in this one, but still the paint it at fault here too)."
6666,2020-10-10 20:47:45,j8mb21,"To be honest, I'm not sure I understand what you mean by the poor layering performance. The paintings you've posted have very little layering and the colours are tinted out very pale, and poor layering performance, at least when I'm painting, generally rears it's head when I try to lay the paint down thick and dark. Transparency is generally considered a desirable quality, so hard edges showing through subsequent layers is how watercolour is supposed to be. Maybe I'm misunderstanding what it is you're having difficulty with."

6689,2020-10-10 12:54:31,j8ikov,It’s really too bad that Killian Tillie didn’t fall to this pick. Even with the health concerns there’s not a better fit in the draft.
6690,2020-10-10 17:18:18,j8ikov,They already have okafor do they really need another player who’s been consistently comped to him
6691,2020-10-10 18:00:36,j8ikov,I feel like people are just voting for names they recognize rather than considering team specific needs.
6692,2020-10-10 13:37:32,j8ikov,DO NOT TAKE MY VERNON GUY!!!
6693,2020-10-10 23:54:09,j8ikov,"Derrick Favors may be out the door. Wide body to provide a change up from Jaxson Hayes. Some potential as an outside shooter. And like the other dude said, he’s just BPA at this point. Maybe he’s not a great fit for the league these days, but maybe he adapts enough that you get a starting caliber C in the second round"
6694,2020-10-10 20:45:26,j8ikov,He's overwhelmingly the BPA here.
6695,2020-10-10 13:30:02,j8ikov,Malachi Flynn with the Sixers is a better fit tbh.
6696,2020-10-10 18:05:57,j8ikov,"i think Okoro is the exact guy the Cavs are needing. but you’re right, Tillie would be great here"
6697,2020-10-10 17:34:44,j8ikov,Ppl here must not watch the NBA
6698,2020-10-10 18:29:31,j8ikov,"Yeah, personally I think the last thing the pels need is a 5 who can't shoot it consistently or defend."
6699,2020-10-10 19:17:21,j8ikov,Drafting for needs at the 39th pick probably isn’t wise either.
6700,2020-10-10 19:56:04,j8ikov,"I would rather that we take Daniel Oturu.

Fits the same need, but better all around prospect, IMO."
6701,2020-10-10 14:32:34,j8ikov,"Lol, I guess we did have a chance at him falling to us. At least we might be one of Carey Jr or Reggie Perry. I like both of them."
6702,2020-10-11 00:20:06,j8ikov,"Sam Merrill is a wayyy better player and a much more valuable player than Carey. I’m sure there are others. A traditional center that can’t defend and can’t stretch the floor will never be BPA, what’s the upside? He plays 10 a minutes a night for you sometimes in the regular season?"
6703,2020-10-10 21:00:01,j8ikov,Him being BPA here doesn’t change the fact he won’t get any minutes and is a terrible fit on this pels team.
6704,2020-10-10 13:35:54,j8ikov,"Eh, agree to disagree there. The pelicans are hurting for a stretch big whereas the sixers have a lot of guys already that could minimize Flynn’s role (Simmons, shake). I still really like Flynn but I don’t really like the philly fit like everyone is touting"
6705,2020-10-10 23:55:24,j8ikov,Yeah no one on this nba topic sub watches the NBA lets just go with that🤦🏿‍♂️
6706,2020-10-10 23:26:07,j8ikov,Drafting for need in general isn’t a wise move. Unless everything else is equal.
6707,2020-10-10 20:00:14,j8ikov,"Wouldn't mind him. He's my alternative to Carey.
Oh, check out my last post, just posted, on r/NBASpurs where I talk about it way better."
6708,2020-10-10 14:41:10,j8ikov,I'm doing that post I was talking about exactly right now lol. I'll post it as soon as possible 🙏
6709,2020-10-11 01:47:23,j8ikov,"He doesn’t stretch the floor *yet*. I’m pretty sure he’ll be shooting the 3 in the league. The upside in him is that he realizes early on that he’s not going to be the focal point of any offense so he starts tapping into his ancillary skills to fit in. He will probably always struggle sliding his feet to cut off penetration, but he could be a solid rim protector (he’s bouncier than he gets credit for, and his frame should be tough to finish thru).

I think the likely scenario is that he’s your typical 8/4 bench big in ~15 min, but he was ranked pretty highly in HS for a reason. Not just for parking himself in the paint and putting the ball thru the hoop. The main issue is whether he figures out how to not get picked apart on defense"
6710,2020-10-10 13:46:59,j8ikov,"Simmons would maximize Flynn if anything. Simmons is a terrific PnR roll man and Flynn is the best PnR ball handler in the class plus an amazing shooter (something you need to insulate Simmons with).

Flynn adds shooting, which the Sixers need desperately. Ball handling in the half court, which the Sixers need desperately. Perimeter playmaking, which the Sixers need desperately. A competent PnR partner for Simmons/Horford. Which the Sixers need desperately. A handoff partner for Embiid, which the Sixers need desperately, I could go on.

Of course he's not going to be a superstar in all these rolls, but he does everything that the Sixers are currently missing. He's at the very least going to be a bench guy on the Sixers purely out of his fit alone with the rest of the team."
6711,2020-10-11 01:26:40,j8ikov,They must not if they think Vernon Carey Jr is a good fit with the Pelicans.
6712,2020-10-11 02:51:56,j8ikov,"You can get that guy anywhere though, Joakim Noah can still get you that and he doesn’t even play. I just don’t see the point in investing a draft pick in him"
6713,2020-10-10 15:32:06,j8ikov,"Yeah Flynn would be fantastic. can never have enough ball handling. Adding Flynn and hopefully moving Richardson for a Schroder type (or a bigger trade for CP3 👀) would give the Sixers Simmons-CP3-Flynn, and Shake can be a decent ancillary ball handler that can still excel off the ball. I think Flynn can contribute reasonably soon"
6714,2020-10-10 17:25:18,j8ikov,"I genuinely agree with all of these things. He’s a good shooter and ball handler, Simmons is a good roll man and he’s a decent piece for them. My worry is that he won’t get a ton of touches and I think this neuters him. Is he really a good enough spot up shooter to be off ball for ~70% of the time he’s on the floor.

I don’t really know why I’m arguing this but here goes. Tillie would stretch the floor and allow a ton of room for Zion and Ingram drives and he’s genuinely one of the most talented players in this class it’s just the health and age concerns. I’m not actually opposed to Flynn on Philly I’m just not as giddy as others are."
6715,2020-10-11 11:01:03,j8ikov,"I just said what the upside in him in is, he’d potentially be a dynamite bench big or Enes Kanter with a 3 ball. It’s a healthy risk-reward where the downside is that you still probably get a rotation player. Most 2nd round picks amount to nothing anyway, we’re not talking about taking him in the lottery."
6716,2020-10-10 15:41:54,j8ikov,"Yeah, we put Shake in as a primary ball handler right away this season even though he was very clearly not prepared for it because we literally had no-one else to do it.

Even if Flynn isn't great he'll still be a *massive* improvement from the guys we had this year lol."
6717,2020-10-10 18:26:02,j8ikov,"I mean of course he won't be perfectly utilized in the starting lineup as is, no player would be. But the thing I have with Tillie is that he's such an amazing fit on *any* team on the league just because of how damn talented and versatile he is. It's almost like saying ""Zion is a perfect fit with X team"", so I'm inclined to not agree so much. 

Tillie is the perfect modern 4. I feel like he's no better of a fit in New Orleans than he is in, say, Boston."
6718,2020-10-10 15:55:13,j8ikov,"You ain’t lyin. 

if they do decide to to wing, I’d put Isaiah Joe number 1 on my board among his peers, but I honestly don’t think it’s really that big of a hole for us. Simmons is Simmons, Tobias will be back, and Furk and Thybulle should be"
6719,2020-10-10 17:10:15,j8ikov,"If we're guaranteed to get Flynn I like Joe.

If there's going to be a Herro-like player in this draft it would be him."
6720,2020-10-10 10:54:48,j8idvi,"Going off of what fictionfantom said, but with a bit more explanation-
While yes, the “lines” of background characters enhance the atmosphere, they are not essential. At most, you should write maybe a small paragraph describing the background noise/lines/whatever. 

An action line saying something along the lines of~
“John finds Emily through a bustling crowd” implies that there will be a ton of background noise. 

Stuff like this is usually best left to the director. They should know their shit well enough to know when to have background noise/chatter.

The only possible exception is if there is a very specific and important thing they are all saying. That is rare"

6728,2020-10-10 14:01:07,j8fp8k,"Schmidt has value, I would prefer Schmidt and mcnabb gone to fit in petro and we keep fleury. Bring Hague up to be his partner 

Idk, but that’s my dream situation. Could be fantastic for Hague’s development to be paired with a legend like pietrangelo. He couldn’t be worse that Schmidt and mcnabb were in the playoffs so it’s a worthwhile gamble in my eyes

Oh and yea, I would fucking love it if haula came back

Swap haula and glass. Glass needs to be a top 6 forward for his development. Haula Stephenson and tuch would be an unreal third line"
6729,2020-10-10 12:31:13,j8fp8k,"I hate saying this but Schmidt and Flower moves for Pietrangelo, Center and a Backup Goaltender. In all honesty if we were able to keep Flower I’d love it but it doesn’t look like it at all."
6730,2020-10-10 14:29:53,j8fp8k,There's 2 smart ways to fit Petro IMO. Either get Fleury's full cap hit out somehow + Holden or Retain 3m on Fleury+ Marchessault. I think it would be pretty stupid to trade any of the other big contract guys. You move Schmidt and you're still short a top pair D to play with Petro. If there's room in after Petro and a goalie for Haula that's nice especially in the Marchie scenario.

6741,2020-10-10 04:41:05,j8dubu,"Greiss and Korpisalo are the ones being supposedly talked about. I'd be open to either one, leaning more towards Korpisalo. I dunno if Darcy Kuemper is still a viable option without giving up something substantial/eating some cap space up, but I'd love to have him on board with Ned or Mrazek as a backup.

The pessimist in me says that Waddell will twiddle his thumbs the entire offseason and just keep Mrazek and Reimer for next season. Blah.

Next Day Edit: Greiss is out of the equation. They must either be either truly looking to stick with the trade market or too stubborn to see a need to change things up..."
6742,2020-10-10 04:45:46,j8dubu,"I would be interested in Korpisalo the most. It depends on what we would have to give up to get him of course. We would have to give up some good pieces to get him. I wouldn't mind Fleury if Vegas eats half of his contract, still think he has a couple of good seasons left in him. Greiss is pretty good but I think somebody will overpay for him and I don't want it to be us. No thanks on Mike Smith and Aaron Dell, I'd rather give Ned a run then either of them."
6743,2020-10-10 04:08:37,j8dubu,"My guess is nothing, but if I had to guess one I’d say greiss is probably the most likely of the list.  Fleury could also make sense if Vegas gets desperate but who knows if we are on fleury no trade"
6744,2020-10-10 06:37:22,j8dubu,"If Vegas does manage to get Pietrangelo, I feel like us finally convincing them to attach a 1st to Fleury's contract is the most likely thing to happen."
6745,2020-10-10 05:51:16,j8dubu,Korpisalo Greiss or Fleury. If we don’t end up with one of these I’ll be highly upset
6746,2020-10-10 04:12:23,j8dubu,"Looking at that list, I don't see any goalie that didn't get a huge deal today that would have been an upgrade for us."
6747,2020-10-10 15:07:26,j8dubu,"I have been very impressed with Greiss over the past couple of seasons, but don't see him as a huge upgrade from Mrazek and Reimer really. I'd say we have to do something more drastic to move past our current combo.  I know they both want to be the starting goalie though so that could create some tension long term. 

If we really want a shake up... I'd say we drop both of them, bring Fleury over and bring up Ned.  That gives Ned a couple of years under one of the best to really learn the ropes and get prepared.  Fleury is still top top notch between the pipes.  I also know that Vegas may just be trying to get someone to give a little money for Fleury as part of a larger trade... so I doubt this is even a real option."

Korpisalo is only 26, Greiss is 34. Both of them are bigger than our current duo. Honestly I don't know why we'd pursue Greiss at all, other than him shutting us down regularly for a couple seasons. Now, Kuemper is interesting. 30 years old, bigger guy at 6' 5"" and notwithstanding the messy 9 games in the bubble, his last two seasons were in the 2.3ish GAA and a save percentage north of .92x. If Kuemper can be had without losing a top 6 forward, a top 4 dman or a 1st round pick, then let's get him. That being said, as the goalie market goes from high supply to low supply (with so many off the board on day 1), the price will go up. Especially for a clear number 1."
6762,2020-10-10 15:00:15,j8dubu,Kuemper will definitely require a first.  Not sure on what koprisalo would could but it’s probably at least a 2nd and a prospect

No. Nothing about your feelings is unnatural, no matter how stigmatized.

6792,2020-10-10 03:23:35,j8coz0,TLDR: Log on and do your dailies. Spend Resin when you can. You're gonna need a lot of talent books. 4star crafted weapons are good.
6793,2020-10-10 04:53:19,j8coz0,"Mora Leylines are worth it below AR35. You gain around 44k Mora/leyline at AR35, whereas you gain around 36k at AR30. On the other hand, domains drop twice as many 4* artifacts on average at AR35, hypostasis/regisvine start dropping far more mats (and purple-rarity shards) along with 5* artifacts (very noticeably the Gladiator set) at very low rates, and talent/weapon domains drop ~2x more loot.

(I personally still farmed artifact dungeons just to make things go faster. Also 4k damage on Keqing E at AR35 against Lv. 60 enemies is cool.)

Anyways -- all this, in combination with the simple fact that Mora is in excessively high demand (1m goes away in a blink; you'll never have enough) means that though you shouldn't go *hard* on leylines, they're definitely still worth it. For the record, each elite enemy kill gives you like 200 Mora or something at WL4, and common enemies give an even worse amount, so unless you're farming 25/7 then I believe that it's not technically ""infinite."" Unless you count resin being infinite since you can just wait for it. Sigils start coming at a far slower pace after AR35; I received 400k Mora in one trade in but after a day of farming now I only get around 50k (specifically from sigils, and specifically chest farming).

Everything else is relatively self-explanatory. Crescent Pike is amazing for Xiangling main DPS, but not quite for the same reasons mentioned (see here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/j7tgdk/crescent_pike_explained_the_best_dps_polearm_in/). If it was just a normal ATK% buff then it'd be noticeably worse.

**Probably the most important part:** Do not purely follow chest routes (i.e., ignoring areas outside of general chest farm area) until you have opened something like >400 chests in Mondstadt and >600 chests in Liyue.

You miss out on literally dozens or hundreds of chests by just following chest routes, simply because you have so many chests that were never opened in the overworld first. That's how I got to AR35 a couple days ago -- literally just explore the entire world methodically and you'll get over 200 chests (admittedly over 8+ hours). Chest routes are meant for people who have already done all this and are AR37+.

6814,2020-10-11 01:50:00,j8coz0,"4 star pity rate is independent of doing 10rolls or single rolls, your guaranteed 4 star in a 10 roll is just your pity rate reset. in a single roll you can roll a 4 star before 10 rolls if you are lucky and reset your pity rate before all 10 rolls. for specifics look it up on youtube, there are better videos"

6816,2020-10-10 20:03:35,j8coz0,Enviosity is probably your best bet for abyss. Scaling is not linear so from floor 9 its MUCH harder.

6818,2020-10-10 20:04:38,j8coz0,">I think most ""atk as dmg"" bonus has somekind of cooldown with it

They will probably give the passive a cooldown so it has less than 100% uptime, meanwhile abuse it to hit floor 8 abyss before friday reset."
6819,2020-10-10 20:14:02,j8coz0,">who is a better carry between chongyun, xiangling and razor (still dont have razor but can be acquired with that resource at 1 per month, and just got xianling a few minutes ago) been using chongyun barbara fishl and traveler so far.

Let me give you a sample team with what youve given me for up to floor 8 abyss.  


Xiangling lvl 70 MAX TALENT MAX ASCENSION (**crescent pike** *this is the OP weapon that lets you compete with whales*)  
Lisa lvl60/70 (mappa mare)  
Razer/Chongyun lvl70 MAX TALENT MAX ASCENSION (prototype animus)  
MC lvl60/70 (can max over razer/chong) (Prototype Rancour)  
Barbara lvl 30+ (Thrilling tales of dragon slayers)  
Everyone else: Doesnt fucking matter. low as possible to max everyone else

use weapons as listed here or in my guide above.   


Those 5 will give you 2 primary carries and 2 subcarries, one for each team with barbara as an addditional healer. This can clear spiral abyss 8 at rank 30 and lvl 60 not 70 even if you are gosu enough and max out all your artifacts with %atk bonuses."
6820,2020-10-10 22:26:54,j8coz0,"Do not bother rerolling unless you want to simp for a waifu/husbando for PURE SIMPING REASONS as in you love the character/VA/aesthetic or whatever else (which is entirely justified!!!! I did this and others too!). If you want to be OP strong rerolling will not achieve that for you REGARDLESS OF WHAT TIER LISTS SAY ABOUT CHARACTERS as weapons and artifact stats are king right now (%atk!!!!)

Abyss 9 is almost a hard wall even for whales (multi thousands for constelations and OP gachaweapon refinement / resin spamming for artifact sets See:Wolf's Gravestone and those atk% mods). PURE F2P can EASILY clear up to that point with a little bit of planning and following what you see here.

So no don't reroll, just use what characters you think are cool and you like, if you dont think you can have fun without diluc though keep going.

ALSO: spending your time rerolling when you could be spending time grinding chests??? if you wanna hit AR35 for a near-guarantee at clearing 8-3 your gonna have to farm chests and the more time you reroll is less efficient resin spent on your main and less time you have spent chest farming post 30 if you plan on getting to the points listed in the guide before 1.1 in Nov 11. rolling Diluc WILL NOT HELP IN THIS. Hope this helps"
6821,2020-10-11 20:39:28,j8coz0,"You use barbara as a support to switch in quickly, use your skills and switch out back into your DPS. thrilling tales is better here because it gives a 45%atk bonus to your main DPS (with refinement).

in coop, prototype malice is better because you are not switching. but coop content is easy so far."
6822,2020-10-23 08:04:57,j8coz0,"Even more toons now. I think I have a pretty solid set of toons at this point.  
Bennett, Noelle, Fischl, razor, Chongyun, Ningguang, Kqing and the other standard units at AR10."

6825,2020-10-10 13:24:05,j8coz0,"Yep, I'm currently AR35 and getting 44k from leylines, I guess I sorta just brainfarted really hard."
6826,2020-10-10 20:02:42,j8coz0,at 40 they become consistent at 35 they drop at a low chance.
6827,2020-10-11 04:21:30,j8coz0,How much does the pity increase per pull? Is it possible to pull past 10 single pulls and not have reset the 4 star pity?
6828,2020-10-11 07:27:20,j8coz0,"tyvm for the info :)

so xianling should be the dps in this sample? or razer/chong? 
also between razor and chong who is better? :)

thanks again

edit: also lisa instead of fischl? thanks :)"

6830,2020-10-10 03:21:22,j8coz0,The resin is extra thick and potent here ;)
6831,2020-10-10 20:58:41,j8coz0,thx for nice info
6832,2020-10-11 05:25:16,j8coz0,"it is not pity rate increase, you are guaranteed at least 1 4star every 10 pulls but resets every time you pull a 4 star. so you can have it reset in less than 10 pulls which is better"
6833,2020-10-11 19:16:44,j8coz0,Fischl was not in your main team that was AR22 so i did not include but Fischl is technically a TINY bit better but bother serve the same purpose as secondary DPS. Chong is probably better due to elemental variance for your team but Razor has the highest theoretical (nongameplay applicable) DPS with whaling/lategame but again these are small min max reasons where your ability to clear will most likely not be affected
6834,2020-10-13 03:05:01,j8coz0,"DFO was the best, a shame I also quit DFO only because of energy system, if they got rid of it I would play DFO again even now, well I guess I played kDNF but it's the same thing."

6836,2020-10-11 06:49:24,j8coz0,"Good to know, thanks. Hopefully i didn't lose out on too many 4 stars so far"
6837,2020-10-11 09:07:41,j8coz0,"AFAIK, doing 10 pulls still works the same, e.g. if you pull 1 by 1 and gets 4* at 4th pull, doing 10 pull instead means u have 6 pulls past that and your pity counter is at 6. You can check the pull history for that"
6838,2020-10-11 22:47:50,j8coz0,"i am ar25 now :D and yes i have fishcl. all const 1, excpet for main characer and barbara. 
also in ""theory"" i can keep buying razors with glitter right? while the same doesnt apply to chong.  (i still dont have my first razor still haha just in case)
so in this case, the safest 1st weapong to craft would be the 4* claymore right? as it can be used on either chong or razor (in the future). also note that i have a level 40 debate club, so maybe the 4* claymore can wait? :)
thanks :D"
6839,2020-10-11 19:17:04,j8coz0,Would love confirmation on this.
6840,2020-10-12 18:45:36,j8coz0,razor will be a LONG term goal as the shop is a monthly reset AND could change. so chong or razor is both fine. its all about who you like more. chong will have support application theoretically even 2+ years down the line as his E is very valuable for spamming elemental reactions and in turn energy while as I said before razor is current best raw DPS but can get powercrept cuz gachagame.
6841,2020-10-15 15:11:26,j8coz0,"Ive done it with over 100 single pulls. The rate is fixed. The pity timer guarantees the 10th pull is 4* if the previous 9 were not and 90th pull is 5* if previous 89 were not. I pulled venti on 90th try, followed by jean and venti in the next 30 or so."

6854,2020-10-10 01:32:24,j8bl50,"The majority of people think of it as an average review. Like a basic score out of 100.

It’s actually the number of people who gave it a positive review. 

So instead of “on average, reviewers gave the film 26% out of 100” ... it’s “26% of people gave it a thumbs up rather than a thumbs down”

It’s less about the quality of the film and more about the broadness of the appeal of the film."

It the score tells you nothing of the quality of the film, just how many people enjoyed it.

I agree with OP expect his origins review. I did not experience any major glitch in its patched state , the story was more cohesive than city , the boss battles were some of the best , the writing and voice acting were great (seriously Roger and Troy did an amazing job sounding as similar as possible to the og voices) , the combat was improved slightly etc

I love all the games.

Really odd thing to bring up, because people tend to experience things differently.

> the story was more cohesive than city

Really? I felt it was only more cohesive because it was drastically simplified. I'd love to hear why you think this.

> the boss battles were some of the best

I liked Firefly and Bane, but the rest felt very... simple. Dodge, batarang, hit things. I don't see how Origins' are much better than Rocksteady's.

> seriously Roger and Troy did an amazing job sounding as similar as possible to the og voices

This comment always makes me feel insane, because I don't hear it. I can audibly hear the Chris Redfield in Batman, and Troy Baker sounds so unlike Mark Hamill that I frequently mistook him for Mad Hatter."

6878,2020-10-10 01:31:38,j8azms,Great tips!
6879,2020-10-10 01:44:45,j8azms,"You cant really compare 4star weapons to 5star ones. I mean have you looked at wolf greatsword? That shit has like 40% more attack at same level then 4star greatswords and the base attack is a lot higher as well. 5star weapons are more important then actual characters since its basically an extension of your characters base attack. For example razor has 183attack on lvl 70 while wolfs greatsword give 400+ base attack along with 60+% atck modifier AND additional attack proc for entire party. Meanwhile, Prototype greatsword gives 22% attack and 360ish base with a shitty proc every 15sec. How is that even comparable?"
6880,2020-10-10 01:51:51,j8azms,"Not all 5star weapons are created equal, obviously many 5star weapons are BiS and are much stronger than 4star weapons. Isn't it disingenuous to point out one of the most busted gacha weapons compared to prototype animus which isnt even the best crafted weapon? F2P players have to eek out whatever they can where they can and not be picky.

Now lets compare say something like kunwu's iris rift or even the primordial jade spear to crescent pike? are the differences between them that big? I would argue not.

By in far 5star>4star>3star BUT you can make lower star weapons incredibly effective to compete with or even overtake 5star weapons in the case of weapons like crescent pike. as was the point of the post, for f2p players."
6881,2020-10-10 02:14:16,j8azms,"The 4-star prototype at refinement rank 5 does 480% of your character's total ATK every 15 seconds, while the Wolf Greatsword  at refinement rank 1 adds 40% base ATK (not total ATK) to characters with only 40% uptime and that 40% uptime is only for 30% of the fight. Even if you have no other sources of +% ATK to narrow down the roughly 40% base ATK gap between the two, 480% ATK over 15 seconds is roughly 32% total ATK per second. The difference between a refinement rank 5 4-star prototype claymore and a rank 1 Wolf greatsword is honestly not as large as you make it sound. Also, the higher your +% ATK from other sources, the smaller the difference gets."
6882,2020-10-10 19:27:35,j8azms,"You do realise 5star weapons all have a higher base, right? That base alone is enough to overthrow practically everything. Every 5star weapon with atk% as a substat is immediately better. At 90 those gaps only get bigger. Not to mention getting refinement for prototype to max is not possible for quite some time. I havent gotten a single one other then 2 store bought ones. You are making it sound as if it is easy to make a maxed out 4star weapon. I would say it is easier to pull a weapon from pity then maxing 1 4star weapon. Not all 5star weapons have great substats but most of them are pretty awesome overall both i terms of damage and utility. Its like when I hear people talk that flute is better then all 5 star swords...it really isnt. Not by a longshot."
6883,2020-10-10 19:35:17,j8azms,How much higher is the base ATK at 90? At level 70 it's just 488 base ATK on the 5-star claymore versus 455 base ATK on the 4-star claymore. That's literally a 7% difference which gets even smaller when you consider that its added to the base ATK from other sources like the feather artifact and the character base. A 5-star feather gives 311 base ATK so the base ATK comparison becomes 799 for the 5-star versus 766 for the 4-star. That means the base ATK difference is now only around 4-5%. It's nowhere near as significant as you make it out to be.
6884,2020-10-10 22:09:25,j8azms,"Prototype has 429 atk. Idk where you are getting your info. I am actually playing the game so I know it is that much as I have seen both weapons in play. 429 base atk  with 22.7% increased atk while wolfs gravestone has 457atk with 40.9% incrased atk + 20% from passive + 40% from proc. Does this look minor to you? Btw idk if you are aware but weapon base attack is literally the same as character base attack because those 2 are added up before using the % applifiers meaning the entire math is different.

Formula
ATK Power = [(Character Base ATK + Weapon Base ATK) × (Weapon ""Base ATK%"" bonuses + Artifact ""Base ATK%"" bonuses)] + Artifact ""ATK"" flat bonuses + ATK from Plume of Death artifact

You actually went ahead and added flat attack bonus into base stats omegalul. You are so wrong dude no wonder you think it's not that significant. Feather goes into math at the very end like all other flat bonuses. It's like that in every gacha literally. That's why FLAT BONUSES SUCK. They always will.

To give you a perspective that's actually correct.
Diluc base attack @70 is 253
(253+457)*(60,9+100)+311 --> 100 is whatever your total atk% from arts totals. 311 is the 5star plume, 60,9% is from gravestone and so is 457 base.

2157
vs
1811

(253+429)*(22,7+100)+311 would be the math with same artifact numbers as above just different weapon which is prototype now.

These are just test numbers and in reality at lvl 90 those numbers are even more apart.

Artifacts in reality could easily give over 100% but just for the quick math I used 100% while it could easily go over 180%

at lvl 70 both art and character it's over 350 atk difference which is a lot. Every crit you scale of your atk gets multiplied even further which means it will be even greater difference."

6940,2020-10-09 23:27:56,j89qrd,Shoot your shot girls but if she rejects your advances move on. Idk if she’s playing games but her liking a guy isn’t a 100% rule out especially if he’s taken. If she finds you attractive you will be successful probably
6941,2020-10-09 23:31:36,j89qrd,"To me, if a girl talks about her crushes to you she probably isn't interested. Just because it's such an obvious ""what not to do"" when you are into someone. However, since he's taken she isn't going to be putting effort into trying to get with him. So I'd totally give it a shot.

I'd maybe try to establish some communication over text that doesn't have to do with the class. Start a conversation by asking a question about the class then you can sort of switch it to a more personally conversation by asking how her day is. Once you guys get a point where you are starting conversations not about class, that's when you should tell her."
6942,2020-10-10 00:17:01,j89qrd,"Honestly build on the friendship first. Any good relationship is built with a good foundation of trust and communication. Depending on your age, your looks could be everything to do with it. She may be shallow, or she may not be. If she is telling you about her crush that could mean two things: 
1. She isn’t interested in you, and probably won’t be, if she continues to talk about him. 
Or
2. She wants you to get jealous and only thinks he is cute and is not truly “interested” in him. 

But, if you just met, well “met” then I’d say she is probably only looking at you as a friend. 
Don’t give up hope though! If you show her what a knockout guy you are, she may come around. I’d say for now, like her but don’t like her too much. Develop a friendship, and see how she acts in a few months. You’ve got this king, it’ll all be alright. Girls are weird (I’d know, I am one) and they can switch sides on the flip of a coin and maybe one day the coin will flip in your favor. Update us when you can!"

6944,2020-10-10 04:34:42,j89qrd,You’re right. I’ll try and let her know around Sunday and will keep you updated. I guess I can’t give up just yet. Thanks so much for taking the time to reply to this post and hope you have a great evening!
6945,2020-10-10 04:38:42,j89qrd,"Hey there, thanks for taking the time to reply to my post. You’re right about probably her probably not being into me, I’ll probably try one time before moving on. When I called her, I only talked to her for 15 minutes before being having to leave, but we did sort of formed a connection. I was thinking of just straight out telling her, but I realized it would have been too much after reading your reply. I’m planning on calling her again Sunday and follow your advice. Thanks so much and have a great day!"
6946,2020-10-10 04:48:30,j89qrd,"Hey there, I appreciate that you took your time to reply to my question. I think you’re right about her potentially viewing me more as a friend, but I’ll try to let her know I like her and go on from there. When I called her, I got to get to know her a little bit was cut short after 15 minutes because I had to leave. Hopefully I can call her again this Sunday and I’ll let her know. So she’s 18, so I’m sure looks to her are important. Part of me is hoping she’s trying to test me. I actually replied “Oh yeh he’s a great looking guy”. I will make sure to update you after I let her know I like her. Thanks so much and hope you have a good evening!"
6947,2020-10-10 17:43:37,j89qrd,"Oh man, I really appreciate you replying to me. I was a little down when I typed my post and didn’t realize I was harming myself more. Thanks for pointing that out. I’m planning on letting her know I like her tomorrow, do you think it is best to tell her over text or on a call. A suggestion somebody made in here was to get to her and then let her know, but I feel call would be too much for her. However, I’m willing to go that route if it is better. What do you think? Thanks for replying to my post, I needed your comment as I was feeling a little down."
6948,2020-10-12 19:58:30,j89qrd,So she said she viewed me as a friend smh just glad to get it over with. Thanks for the help!

6952,2020-10-10 01:27:36,j88z1k,Thanks for the post. Can you explain the scoring in the photo? Giving Florida's defense a higher score than their offense just sounds wrong. Also having TAMU offense so close to UF offense gets my jorts in a bunch.
6953,2020-10-10 05:15:51,j88z1k,"Years of losing to Jimbo makes me fear him a bit, even though I believe our current head coach is better than the ones that faced him and FSU."
6954,2020-10-10 10:47:19,j88z1k,"*Expect to see a lot of shotgun formation with RPOs to help keep the Gator defense off-balance*

Corral has been balling out and I think Kiffins gonna turn that program around.
Texas AM doesnt really fill me with fear from any position 
Looking forward to seeing the most decisive win of the season"
6957,2020-10-10 07:41:02,j88z1k,I mean. I am just technologically stupid. My question is how do I get on on this Discord thing.
6958,2020-10-10 01:32:36,j88z1k,"Speaking for Eric here, so I hope I capture it right. This is based off our recruiting rankings, and we have been recruiting higher rated defensive players during Mullen’s tenure compared to offensive players. 

This also ties in well with the fact that UF historically is associated with top defenses. I’m not as familiar with the calculation of the adjusted score, but /u/Eric-UF can speak to that"
6959,2020-10-10 12:56:02,j88z1k,Download discord through whatever app store you use. Click the discord link at the bottom of the article. Follow the instructions on the wrlcome to discord floridagators channel to get approved and see the real channels.
6960,2020-10-10 01:47:12,j88z1k,"Correct (and thanks), the numbers are based on the 247 Composite  Rankings (raw score) and then factored based on class (adjusted).

But, to your comment and why I love this type of analysis....Florida's offense is not pitted against A&M offense...you have to look at the specific match ups....DL vs OL and Wr vs DB....

Granted, I'm not sure either offense is really worried about who they are facing, but given the lack of experience on the A&M side (secondary and receiver) I like our chances....then add in that our QB is significantly better than thier QB...and we should be able to win this....but that is why they play the games.

The ""unkown"" factor is that A&M is a wounded animal and Jimbo's gumbo is getting hotter, so the motivation and desperation is there for A&M to fight like their lives (or jobs) depend on it."
6961,2020-10-10 01:49:45,j88z1k,"Ah, that makes sense then"
6962,2020-10-09 22:52:37,j88uic,I think the story is shallow and the characters very cliche but I guess thats just personal taste
6963,2020-10-09 23:26:50,j88uic,Did you beat it already?
6964,2020-10-10 15:55:04,j88uic,"I've seen this take almost exclusively from people who haven't played more than a few hours. By the time you're in the thick of the EA the story really opens up and most of the companions establish themselves as strong characters. I don't know you can say that characters like Wyll or Shadowheart are ""cliche."""
6965,2020-10-10 09:26:22,j88uic,ive already uninstalled it
6966,2020-10-09 22:35:17,j87nku,"The Dodgers org is full of smart people. I applied for an analytics internship and it was one of the hardest applications/tests I’ve ever taken. These guys don’t mess around. 

Everything the Dodgers demand is the best of the best and its paying off here."
6967,2020-10-09 22:33:59,j87nku,"Shit like this is the difference between a team like the Dodgers and a team with deep pockets like the Angels and Phillies. Not only do they open the check book when they have to, but they also have the best scouts and player development in the business."
6968,2020-10-09 22:28:02,j87nku,Such a legendary draft especially if Lux lives up to the hype
6969,2020-10-09 22:05:46,j87nku,"Former Rays utility man, Will Rhymes?

He once sort of fainted after a HBP."
6970,2020-10-09 21:35:12,j87nku,I really need Dusty to start trusting Scrubb more than Josh James
6971,2020-10-09 21:26:42,j87nku,We love ~~Logan White~~ Billy Gasparino!!
6972,2020-10-09 21:24:49,j87nku,"If Scrubb can lower his walk rate, he’d be lights out. His breaking stuff is disgusting. But it’s no surprise that the Dodgers can pinpoint talent from light years away. Their farm team is LOADED."
6973,2020-10-10 13:32:36,j87nku,"As much as i hate their fan base, Dodgers is a 1st rate organization.  They always draft and sign the right guys.  The freaking pipeline never ends for them.  Every year there is a top 20 prospect waiting."
6974,2020-10-10 00:29:19,j87nku,Will Rhymes has come a long way from being the guy who [passed out after getting hit by a pitch in the arm.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyTgs1IV1aE)
6975,2020-10-10 18:02:18,j87nku,Random but I saw Billy Gasparino play for the Single-A Portland Rockies in the late 90’s. Always wondered what happened to him!
6976,2020-10-09 23:51:32,j87nku,To be fair Lux has really sucked so far
6977,2020-10-09 22:47:21,j87nku,"Out of curiosity, what kind of analytics role was it? Data science? Developer? Etc."
6978,2020-10-09 22:54:32,j87nku,"Wow that's crazy, what happened? If you don't mind elaborating a little further. I'm Intrigued 🤔"
6979,2020-10-10 02:24:34,j87nku,"You post made me laugh.

It was just a few years back when the Dodgers staff under prior owner Frank McCourt was filled with the kids of celebrities who knew nothing about business or baseball.  

There were two of Mitt Romney's kids, Jeff Fuller the heir to the Pillsbury fortune who was travelling the world and sleeping with co-owner Jamie McCourt, son Drew McCourt, and even actress Shannon Doherty was rumored for a while to be involved in the Dodgers front office."
6980,2020-10-09 22:38:59,j87nku,Probably a much better ROI long term to spend money on scouting & new technologies there and also on top talent in analytics
6981,2020-10-10 00:24:58,j87nku,And former tiger as well
6982,2020-10-09 22:27:35,j87nku,Wtf happened to Pressly he was unhittable for a while
6983,2020-10-10 01:21:56,j87nku,"Can't totally blame Dusty for not trusting a guy who has a WHIP over 1.5. The peripherals on Scrubb also indicate that he's gotten very lucky this year, which matches up with the eye test of him creating traffic on the bases and avoiding destruction. Similar example: Framber in 2018.

James had actually been going pretty well since coming back from injury in September. ERA was 1.58 and WHIP below 1.00 over 6 appearances. The single run he had allowed was on arguably a mis-play by Tucker.

Add in the leverage of the postseason...and it's a bit more understandable that Dusty would trust someone with postseason experience who had been pitching well as of late over the gas can that is Andre Scrubb.

Both are certainly going to get used in the ALCS given the increased number of games...so we will see who is up to the task against whichever quality lineup emerges from the Rays/Yanks."
6984,2020-10-09 22:50:51,j87nku,"You know I actually met logan white two years ago, he was a very nice guy"
6985,2020-10-09 22:53:45,j87nku,Baseball Ops (data science) I believe was the role. It was about a year ago since and I applied to a ton of different team internships so they all mesh together but for the most part it was Baseball Ops/Data Scientist like.
6986,2020-10-09 22:52:53,j87nku,Yeah I'm super curious myself
6987,2020-10-09 23:03:09,j87nku,"Nothing too crazy, it was I would basically compare it to a final test for Stats I and II. 

Go through all your basic terms all the way up to the big boy stuff. Took an hour or so and submitted some code of previous projects too. 

The Rays were like that as well, however they were timed and most was multiple choice."
6988,2020-10-10 04:21:26,j87nku,Don’t ever bring up the McFucks ever again.....slimeballs the lot of them
6989,2020-10-09 22:40:16,j87nku,"Yes and the best ROI is doing both. 

When you have the best scouting in the league and can also sign Mookie Betts to a 13 year mega deal, you're never going to be bad again."
6990,2020-10-09 22:33:53,j87nku,🤷‍♂️ He missed the start of the year with a sore elbow. It might just be a combination of injury and lack of traditional ramp up to get stretched out.
6991,2020-10-10 01:15:41,j87nku,"Thinks it's a combination of injuries causing inconsistent usage, as well as age.

The fastball velocity has been down for starters. He used to be up around a consistent 98-99 whereas now he's 94-95. The location also simply is not there this year like it was when he was going well. He would tunnel his fastball so well with his breaking ball that when he was on, you just had to guess if the ball was going to drop out of the zone...and if it didn't, it was dotting the edge. Nowadays, he doesn't have that command so counts get extended, pitch counts go up, and he's forced to come further into the zone instead of being able to dot the edges.

He's still a quality reliever and would likely have better numbers if he could stay healthy and moved to a 7th or 8th inning role...but I doubt we get anything like 2018 from him again. Small injuries aren't typically something that will go away for a reliever on the far side of 30."
6992,2020-10-09 23:24:03,j87nku,He was mostly a set up guy last year maybe closing just fucks with his head too.
6993,2020-10-10 05:13:01,j87nku,"Rays, not the Yanks. (smile emoji)"
6994,2020-10-09 23:05:47,j87nku,"Did you end up getting a job in that field? Props bro, sounds like one of those stressful interview type things. I just got hired at space X and I got interviewed by 4 people lol not as bad as I thought it was gonna be, but that was a first. Covid actually helped, since we were all wearing masks. I'm a ginger and turn red when embarrassed so that covered my face and made everything way easier 😂"
6995,2020-10-09 22:41:26,j87nku,Ofc. And it was also the returns from scouting/analytics that led to the Dodgers being able to draft/identify prospects in trades that turned out to be the right asset for Mookie too.
6996,2020-10-10 01:31:24,j87nku,">Small injuries aren't typically something that will go away for a reliever on the far side of 30.

See: Jansen, Kenley"
6997,2020-10-09 23:12:15,j87nku,"I did, I work in the broadcasting side now instead of the team side instead now! Baseball/My Current Position were the least stressful interviews/assessments I've ever had. Everyone I talked to in sports during interviews has been super great and genuinely interested about what I have had to say. 

I will say my worst interview came from a company that put me in a glass box for four hours for everyone to see, mostly alone (like two hours of the interview was just me in a box), and I met about 15 different people. Almost all of which wrote me off when I said I went to a small college and played baseball since they were a ""Big Software"" firm that wanted the best and the brightest.

It was actually that interview that made me decided I didn't want to leave sports and I basically stopped looking at anything that wasn't sports related. 

However GODDAMN congrats on the SpaceX job!"
6998,2020-10-10 01:11:10,j87nku,"Congrats on SpaceX! 4 sounds stressful. I was interviewed for a software job by 3 people over the course of 2 interviews (phone screen, then in-person) at Alaska Airlines, nothing too crazy."

Personally, I'd use PowerQuery to merge all data, make any necessary transformation. Then load to data model, and use Pivot Table to report.

7041,2020-10-09 18:56:46,j84l8y,I didn't expect much last weekend and we came out with a dub. Gonna keep that same mentality and just hope for a close game! GO BIRDS
7042,2020-10-09 19:06:24,j84l8y,"/u/MikeTysonChicken and /u/abenyishay :

That is a crazy impressive game preview - I thought my Reddit broke at first because I was scrolling so much."
7043,2020-10-09 20:03:07,j84l8y,"I think this will be much closer than people are expecting. 

Wentz finally clicked and looked like himself for most of the game last week. This would be Week 1 of the Regular Season if he had a Pre-Season, so here's to hoping that he somehow accumulated more rust than most QB's and will be back to his top form this week. 

Our receiving corps made up of practice squad player play with heart, and even more surprisingly; talent. They are getting open and making great catches. Even without Desean or Alshon, I actually do believe in the corps enough to give Wentz a chance. 

Mailata will be under fire but god damn how cool would it be if he just fucking works that rush?

Boobie doesn't even need a blurb, he's been a stud and if we can get him going at all we are a threat to score from anywhere on the field. 

Defense concerns me less than it did. Yes, Mullens literally ended his career against them. But they seem to really be getting their swagger back, and Ben is usually good for at least a couple head scratching decisions every game; if we can capitalize, we may win the turnover battle. 

I think the surprise week off will hurt them more than it helped them and if we go in there with momentum and get a fast lead I think there's a real chance we don't give it up. 

Eagles- 27  Steelers- 24"
7044,2020-10-09 19:31:17,j84l8y,"Call me insane, or Joe Decamara, although it means the same thing, but Eagles are gonna find a way this week. 

27-23 Birds"
7045,2020-10-10 00:19:23,j84l8y,"The Steelers have beaten 3 of the worst teams in the league.  I know we aren’t playing great, but why is everyone so convinced this is a loss? I don’t think any outcome of this game will surprise me. 

Any given Sunday."
7046,2020-10-09 19:48:35,j84l8y,"Tyron Smith done for the season... Goddamn, this division is a fucking mess

5-10-1 might be enough to take the title"
7047,2020-10-09 19:21:51,j84l8y,"My bet is way lower scoring than people think, as our secondary finally clicks.

17-6 Steelers"
7048,2020-10-09 19:18:56,j84l8y,"The 49ers game, while a lot of fun, did not heal the pessimism I feel for our team in 2020. I think the Steelers are on a warpath and we are just a cobblestone on the road. 

Steelers 38 - Eagles 17"
7049,2020-10-09 18:55:50,j84l8y,"Unfortunately I see this being one step forward two steps back. 

Aslong as it is a competative game i will be okay with the result, but I feel the steelers will grind this one out. 

Pass rush needs to be at 100% Sunday, wents needs to be mobile and the fringe players need to step up again, we have starters coming back but done let that give you false home, they will need this game atleast to get back into the swing of things.

I am hopefully for a win but my gut tells me 24-20 loss.

Fly Eagles Fly

Fuck Dallas"
7050,2020-10-09 20:02:01,j84l8y,Bout to get our cheeks clapped. 31 - 20  Steelers
7051,2020-10-09 20:08:21,j84l8y,BLOOD FEUUUUUD!!!
7052,2020-10-09 22:23:15,j84l8y,"Steelers are big favorites in the game for a reason, but I don't think this is unwinnable. We all thought we were gonna get obliterated by the Packers at Lambeau last year and look what happened."

7054,2020-10-09 19:33:42,j84l8y,"My gut feelings have been right for every game this season other than the Bengals game, and I’m feeling really confident about our boys this weekend. I’m calling a gutsy win that comes down the wire."
7055,2020-10-09 20:12:07,j84l8y,17-13 could go either way
7056,2020-10-09 21:05:42,j84l8y,Is that home wins in all the last 10 meetings...
7057,2020-10-09 21:24:49,j84l8y,"First Take with this clownish take: ""Eagles @ Steelers is a must-win for the Eagles"""
7058,2020-10-09 22:06:31,j84l8y,"Living in Pittsburgh after college, I wore my Alshon super bowl jersey to work. Plenty of comments to go around. I think we got a shot!

What should my next jersey be: Slay, Ward or Graham?"
7059,2020-10-10 00:28:33,j84l8y,QB runs will make or break this game
7060,2020-10-10 03:32:32,j84l8y,"First and foremost, Fuck Dallas! Second, as an NDSU Bison fan, I've also adopted the Eagles as my NFC team. So in this case, I'm hoping for Carson to continue righting the ship, an injury free game, and the Steelers coming out with a hard fought win. Great write up, tons of great info in there, for both sides!"
7061,2020-10-09 19:52:24,j84l8y,I expect a close game (and vintage Steelers playing down to their opponents). I also don't expect many TDs on either side. Both defenses are solid. I am gonna say Eagles win by a FG at 17-14.
7062,2020-10-09 23:17:10,j84l8y,"Carson’s completion percentage is not great but it’s 60% not 50%....

The only shot we have is Carson has to continue moving around the pocket, trust his WRs and take some chances, run the ball well and have the dline knock around Ben....it’s a tall task. Hope our guys are up to it."
7063,2020-10-10 18:57:46,j84l8y,I just hope we win! I know too many obnoxious steeler fans. Swear some of them are just as bad as Cowboys smh. Win this game! E-A-G-L-E-S!
7064,2020-10-10 20:11:21,j84l8y,20-17 birds
7065,2020-10-10 20:32:54,j84l8y,A true match up of first place titans.
7066,2020-10-10 20:56:14,j84l8y,"Eagles win thanks to two interceptions, one from Slay on a deep shot by Big Ben, and a sack fumble courtesy of Genard Avery. 

Eagles offense does just enough in the screen game to eek past the Steelers deadly pass rush. 

21-17 Eagles Win"
7067,2020-10-10 22:03:02,j84l8y,The Steelers are getting wayyyyy to much credit. All 3 of their wins are against bad teams. Maybe if they blew these teams out I’d understand the hype more but I’m not convinced. I’m calling another birds W tomorrow.
7068,2020-10-10 22:41:41,j84l8y,Unfortunately I think we will be the next easy team for the Steelers to beat leaving up the question if they are actually good. 24-13 Steelers.
7069,2020-10-11 02:12:16,j84l8y,We are winning this. Team is going to come out in sync and clicking. Taking down the 49ers was this years turning point. Team will start living up to its potential and defense will carry us.
7070,2020-10-11 02:52:54,j84l8y,We tend to play our best when we are supposed to lose.  Either way I have no expectations.
7071,2020-10-11 04:26:10,j84l8y,carson wentz has fucking sucked so far. hope he gets his shit together here but he prolly won’t. hope i’m wrong
7072,2020-10-11 05:52:09,j84l8y,"Unfortunately this week will probably be another blow to my fire Howie campaign.  Just as i did last week i am predicting the Eagles once again win in ugly fashion. The offense will be ugly of course and the linebackers will once again prove themselves to be perhaps the worst in the nfl but the line will play great, Mills and Slay will hold it down like they do, and Wentz, Sanders, and Ward will find a way to make just enough plays to get it done. 

The plus side to a win might be Howie finally deciding to take a look at making a trade for a legit nfl caliber linebacker."
7073,2020-10-09 19:17:33,j84l8y,I'm honestly rooting for TJ to get like 3 sacks. He deserves DPOY so bad
7074,2020-10-09 22:46:11,j84l8y,I had a dream last night that nick foles had a wildly successful career as a nude model after football.
7075,2020-10-09 21:45:06,j84l8y,"This game is going to be a blowout.

Steelers are a very good team healthy and tested. 

We are constantly more hurt than the week before. Wentz still is a big question mark."
7076,2020-10-09 22:38:42,j84l8y,"Steelers D will tee off on the Eagles Oline... 

Steelers Offense is steadily improving. Ben will be comeback player of the year, and play like it this Sunday.

Steelers over the Eagles 34-17"
7077,2020-10-09 21:12:57,j84l8y,Let's not mince that this is largely /u/rsubs33
7078,2020-10-10 03:14:31,j84l8y,"Steelers are for sure beatable. Daniel Jones of all QBs looked,  not competent,  great against them. They have weaknesses.  Their weapons have no more talent in offense than the eagles. Their defense is a couple great athletes with holes in coverage."
7079,2020-10-09 23:13:19,j84l8y,"Definitely a glass half full kinda guy, aren’t you?

Steelers blitz rate and ability to cause turnovers could make this game Carson’s worst of the year. Given the lack of weapons and playmakers, they’ll be teeing off on him. I genuinely think this will be a blowout. The matchup is not a good one. 

I can’t see how they score more points this week than they did last week considering Pittsburgh has no major injuries unlike SF."
7080,2020-10-10 20:14:41,j84l8y,I see this as a trap game for the Steelers honestly.
7081,2020-10-09 19:55:08,j84l8y,What blood sacrifice did we do to deserve this shit division?
7082,2020-10-09 19:53:35,j84l8y,Steelers aren’t scoring 38
7083,2020-10-09 19:29:28,j84l8y,The Steelers Offense is not that good. They haven’t faced any good teams this season. This will be much closer than that.
7084,2020-10-09 21:45:35,j84l8y,Totally agree
7085,2020-10-09 20:21:38,j84l8y,We were supposed to be a good team. I’m not gonna be happy with a “competitive game.” I understand that I shouldn’t expect a win but I’m bot gonna be OK with an L.
7086,2020-10-09 22:54:58,j84l8y,Fuck Dallas! I’m just hoping for a fun game.
7087,2020-10-09 22:41:51,j84l8y,Line is currently -7 last week was the same last week when we played the 49ers. The 49ers line actually pushed to -11 by game time. Just saying.
7088,2020-10-09 21:41:15,j84l8y,No 2000 and 1988 were both in Pitt and won by the Eagles.
7089,2020-10-09 22:28:11,j84l8y,Graham will be a good jersey at this point regardless of what happens
7090,2020-10-10 20:10:57,j84l8y,Good thing Carson has been more aggressive running it the last couple of games. Screw that old hamburger guy
7091,2020-10-09 20:23:43,j84l8y,Ah yes root for your QB to get sacked because you want an opposing player to get a pointless award.
7092,2020-10-09 22:27:41,j84l8y,"Lmao saved, the eagles defense been really decent and Darius slay has played extremely well, put slay on juju and outside of juju they don’t really have any proven talent, James Conor is good but vs our dline. Only thing I’m worried is our oline being inexperienced and getting destroyed on stunts and adjustments vs a very good Steelers defense"
7093,2020-10-09 21:59:39,j84l8y,It's awesome and I appreciate it - thanks to all involved.
7094,2020-10-10 02:32:46,j84l8y,"Steelers pressure rate is literally against 3 of the bottom 4 teams in the league. They have a combined 1-11 record and they would most likely all have been 0-4 had 2 of them not played each other. Their pass rush is good, but they aren't going to finish the season as high as they are currently ranked. San Fran was missing Bosa, but their pass rush without Bosa is still impressive and was handled decently with our patch work OL. Additionally, I think you are overrating Pittsburgh's offense. Their OL is average and the Eagles pass rush is just as impressive. They are a good team, but the game is gonna be closer than many think."
7095,2020-10-10 21:04:14,j84l8y,Who are the Steelers though? They’ve played opponents so far with a combine win-loss record of 1-11. This won’t be a blowout with the defense we have.
7096,2020-10-10 00:40:14,j84l8y,Carson already had his 7 INTs for the year.   He’s gonna have a perfect rest of the season.
7097,2020-10-10 20:19:26,j84l8y,"Yup, it feels a bit like last week. But the Steelers are healthy and it won’t be an easy win"
7098,2020-10-09 21:44:38,j84l8y,"Timeline shifted when we won the Superbowl.

Was it worth it? Of course."
7099,2020-10-11 20:07:28,j84l8y,You said?
7100,2020-10-09 19:55:46,j84l8y,"Haven’t needed to and won’t need to, but don’t tempt the Benjamin :p

Here’s to a fun game!"
7101,2020-10-09 23:14:55,j84l8y,I think they get 30+ due to short fields and a few big passing plays.
7102,2020-10-09 21:46:03,j84l8y,Washington’s offense wasn’t good either.
7103,2020-10-09 21:07:25,j84l8y,"Like the eagles are a good team lmao. Not saying it’s necessarily their fault, with injuries. Also not saying that it won’t be close, but if it is it won’t be because the eagles are a good team."
7104,2020-10-09 20:51:22,j84l8y,I came from the Steelers subreddit cus one of your guys linked it. Lemme set my flair
7105,2020-10-10 21:00:31,j84l8y,"Eagles finally having a little consistency on the O-line though. That is worth quite a bit as all each OL position played well individually last week, but had some errors in coordination. I expect them to be better this week."
7106,2020-10-10 04:23:17,j84l8y,"You saying we don’t have proven talent outside of Juju at WR shows me you know zero about Steelers football, so why comment on it?"
7107,2020-10-10 03:45:11,j84l8y,The Eagles offense is trash bro. Don’t kid yourself. Wentz (love the guy) but has been absolutely awful according to most metrics.
7108,2020-10-11 01:55:19,j84l8y,"You only play who is on your schedule. 

Eagles offense has yet to score 3 touchdowns in one game. I hardly expect that to happen versus one of the best defenses in the league. They have no one outside of Sanders that creates any yards after contact. Its going to take the best game of Wentz’s career"
7109,2020-10-10 20:20:49,j84l8y,"I mean, I’m not too worried about it. If it’s a defensive battle in the trenches, I’d take our rotation over any front, any day."
7110,2020-10-11 20:29:51,j84l8y,Glad to be wrong
7111,2020-10-10 19:38:21,j84l8y,[deleted]
7112,2020-10-09 22:28:51,j84l8y,Sorry for the other guy being a ass even though I’d feel the same way if a eagles fan was saying that
7113,2020-10-10 09:05:53,j84l8y,"Right? Diontae Johnson, Chase Claypool. They're pretty damn good."
7114,2020-10-11 02:09:47,j84l8y,"You are really overhyping what this game might be for the Steelers. The Steelers are nowhere near a threat as you think they are, they haven’t been since 2017. You act is if we are playing the chiefs. Very winnable game, very close. You go in there expecting a blowout if you want to."
7115,2020-10-11 20:34:26,j84l8y,I couldn’t help it lol.  It was a hell of a game though
7116,2020-10-11 01:56:50,j84l8y,"Well with those shit QBs last year, its understandable."
7117,2020-10-09 18:41:46,j84kj8,So much for an NLDS card😂
7118,2020-10-09 18:45:03,j84kj8,Isn’t that the last player we needed for a full active diamond dodgers lineup
7119,2020-10-09 18:42:24,j84kj8,"16 BB% in September.  19(!!!!!)% on the season.

That discipline is a huge L.

Swung at same percentage of pitches out of the zone as Trout this year."
7120,2020-10-09 18:43:59,j84kj8,very happy about this
7121,2020-10-09 19:11:55,j84kj8,Dude has such a bad swing in the game
7122,2020-10-10 04:17:28,j84kj8,This is a story all about how my life got flipped and turned upside down
7123,2020-10-09 20:58:33,j84kj8,"""Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records..."""
7124,2020-10-09 18:43:45,j84kj8,You don't want a lefty long reliever? I think this is the best possible outcome TBH.
7125,2020-10-09 18:50:30,j84kj8,Yes
7126,2020-10-09 19:19:22,j84kj8,Yup. That mission was brutal.
7127,2020-10-09 18:45:08,j84kj8,He coulda had more power against L
7128,2020-10-09 21:17:21,j84kj8,"I’m glad I’m not the only one
Feels like there is something off with the pitch speed/swing timing
Was getting very early swings on 97mph fast balls"
7129,2020-10-09 19:24:42,j84kj8,Trout apparently has 99 speed and can get to everything😂
7130,2020-10-10 00:16:55,j84kj8,"Either I got serious RNG or I like his swing. I hate seeing these comments when I struggle with a mission, but I just beat the mission first try, all in the first game of the series. 

But that damn Arozarena moment is another story for me..."
7131,2020-10-09 23:31:16,j84kj8,"Between his awful swing, Barria's walking/hitting me repeatedly, and the outfield...this moment is awful."
7132,2020-10-10 02:13:33,j84kj8,"Yeah, true. I just feel the whole motion of his swing is off. From the load to unload if any just feels awkward."
7133,2020-10-09 20:30:04,j849no,The first dodger to have 5 hits in a playoff game and also the youngest player of any team to have 5 hits in a playoff game
7134,2020-10-09 18:30:32,j849no,"They said there were only a handful of guys who have gotten 5 hits in a postseason game, so I assume he did tie the MLB record. They also said he was the youngest to ever do it."
7135,2020-10-10 08:08:50,j849no,Will Smith had more hits in that one game than Machado and Tatis had combined in the entire series.
7136,2020-10-09 18:51:39,j849no,"Right. It was the 9th time a player had 5 hits in a post season game. Will Smith is the youngest ever to do it, and the first Dodger.

What's impressive to me is that all 4 runs the Dodgers scored in the 9th inning came with 2 outs. That's a great killer instinct ... mamba mentality even ... to make sure the Padres had no thoughts about rallying like the night before.

Good to see the offense break out the last 2 games without relying on home runs. They slept walked the first three games."
7137,2020-10-09 18:47:10,j849no,and only catcher to do so
7138,2020-10-09 19:14:50,j849no,"I feel like Smith adjusted his hitting approach too, after having several hits die on the warning track in the first 2 games. I really think we are only going to get stronger as we gain more experience on this field, especially getting used to the weird bounces off the wall. We can take extra bases on balls that hit the dumb cutouts down the line, but have to watch the OF wall bounces. Our OF speed plays well to the size. I know I should be cautiously optimistic, but things are lining up.

The LCS's will be the first time teams from the East and West square off against each other, it will be interesting to see how everyone matches up."
7139,2020-10-10 04:06:51,j849no,"Considering how this field eats up HRs, I’m super glad that not only do the Dodgers have “home field” advantage but that they appear to have figured out how to consistently drive in runs at Globe Life. After years of a feast or famine offense that lived and died by the long ball, it’s a huge relief to see them finally be able to adjust their hitting approach on the fly."

On Xbox it's click left stick to sort by weight, spoil, etc. Don't know what it is on ps or pc. Oldest (about to spoil) will then be at the top. All menus (junk, weapons, misc etc) all have sorting options like that (weight, value, etc). I regularly use it to keep oldest food at the top of the menu or to sort which heaviest things to get rid of. Stash box has same options."

7147,2020-10-09 19:44:25,j840px,"TLDR: Enough of the game has improved for it to be a quality platform for regular, ongoing Fallout enjoyment. However, it is still shallow compared to what it could be, and time spent fixing it has obviously taken away from contributions to questlines and variety. I shared some suggestions of areas of focus, and expressed appreciation for what's been done thus far. I'm crossing my fingers for the potential injection of investment that Microsoft and other studios could offer to the game."
7148,2020-10-09 19:41:51,j840px,"While I'm not as knowledgeable about the game as others on this board, what you're suggesting isn't true. While fighting the SBQ, you get notifications when you get hit by some people, and when you hit some people. This notification occurs during the battle...regularly.

Perhaps it's only when new people zone in. Perhaps it's because you're participating in the event and they are explicitly avoiding hitting the SBQ to get people to hit them. Perhaps it's a bug that you can shoot some people, and not others. There's a lot of shooting going on when the additional scorched mobs spawn.

I didn't realize that this wasn't supposed to happen, otherwise I would have screenshotted the dozen times it's occurred in the past week. I'm pretty sure it's not just my account..."
7149,2020-10-09 19:37:11,j840px,"Well...I tried not to make it completely full of complaints, as I wanted to highlight improvements compared to my initial experience...but it is what it is. Of course, it did turn out longer than expected, but it was also THAT BAD of a meeting..."
7150,2020-10-12 14:24:13,j840px,"I am using multiple ""weight modifying"" perks and armor pieces, so I carry a lot of food, weapons, armor, and ammo with variable weight. The weight displays as ""per item"" rather than the total stack, so unless I pull out the calculator, it's tough to know if I'm better off dropping .38 ammo or 13 pieces of rad stag.

I know that this all can be calculated with invested effort, but I'm normally at 160 carrying capacity. I then start to creep up to 190. Then I get around 220. Then I start hitting 300 and wondering where the hell this is all coming from. I have multiple heavy weapons, but they weigh 1-1.5lbs each. I dropped my missiles and still I'm at 270. I deconstructed all my spare armor and weapons, scrapped my junk, deposited it...and I'm now at 230. (Not a real example, but representative of my experience).

I'm then left wondering how I have 70 lbs extra over what I normally carry. It used to be gunpowder and bobby pins...before those were fixed. Now it turns out to be stuff like grenades (that you can't see when you scrap), or alcohol bottles, or a bunch of unexpected plasma cores.

In short, it would be nice to have a ""W.A.M.M."" features (weight and materials management) that takes a look at what you're carrying, and tells you the total weight of each stack and stack type, so you can better decide which perk to equip, or items to drop, to make your weight more manageable.

I know I carry a lot, and it can get out of hand, and it's my own fault...but most of the time I'm being weighed down by a stack of items that individually aren't that big of an issue, and therefore difficult to identify the problem quickly."
7151,2020-10-09 21:55:30,j840px,"You likely were not in the event zone at all. Since SBQ is a flying enemy, it can fly out of zone. My guess is you were fighting north of v9.

So if you fight SBQ outside of event zone, this can happen. While inside an event zone, everyone is considered on same team and cannot pvp each other.

The moment SBQ dies, pvp returns to normal inside the event zone. Your example indicated you were carrying flux. Flux is awarded *after* event is complete, which tells me this example you mentioned did not occur during the event, but rather after. By the way, no one can drop flux on death. It is instead destroyed in your inventory upon death. No one stole your flux because the game prevents this.

The alternative is that you witnessed your example about a week or more ago, during a period when equipping ""Taking one for the team"" results in you being vulnerable to unprovoked pvp. This was a bug and is now fixed."
7152,2020-10-12 14:12:33,j840px,"As I'm just returning, I'm willing to be ignorant of some things. Most of the battles are around V9...I tend to fight to the east of the building along with other folks, but it's possible to have wandered to the north, which would be why we've only seen one person hitting us, or getting hit. Being outside of the event usually gives a warning and countdown, but I'm also willing to accept that it may have been missed in the flurry of battle.

I was carrying flux, and the event was over. However, I was looting bodies and the culprit came up behind me and melted me in 2 seconds. Unless I engage with someone, damage is laughable, so the only way for this to happen (especially in power armor) would be if it were someone that I'd previously hit. They were now engaging me and melted me.

This has also happened at times when the Fallout 1st ""bases"" are very close to the battle. Folks will put their camp right near V9. I've accidentally shot these camps while fighting the adds that get spawned. I'm wondering if that gets considered an attack on a player. (Can they get damaged?)

Anyway, if the flux got destroyed, I'm fine with that. Take my junk...have a ball. Getting backstabbed for my flux was aggrevating. If they didn't get my flux, and I just happened to fall victim to an errant shot or wandering slightly out of the event zone...I'll take responsibility for that."
7153,2020-10-12 20:26:24,j840px,"Na hitting tents doesn't trigger pvp flag. 

If you're certain it was a player, did you have the perk taking one for the team? You might have been the victim of a bug that no longer exists in current patch.

If you did not see a pvp flag come up but rather just dropped dead in an instant while looting bodies, then it was the mobs. 

Upon SBQ death, a large amount of scorched mobs often spawn directly on her body or will rush to it. This may look like you are taking damage from unknown sources when looting queen."
7154,2020-10-12 20:43:42,j840px,"There were multiple PvP flags (me hitting 1-2 people, them hitting me and my kids intermittently). I was then killed by a player, was told he killed me, saw him kill me and loot my stuff, and he then ran off and logged off so I couldn't find his base and raid it. So, it was a PvP scenario that initiated during the SBQ fight. Now, it's also possible that I hit this one person after the SQB died (while clearing out the remaining adds), but I don't believe that was the case. I was looting the corpses of the bodies as soon as the SBQ died as there were few adds remaining. (We were clearing them during the event).

I don't think I have ""take one for the team"" enabled, but I'm not near the xbox to look it up. If that's the case, that might be it. Or, as mentioned in another thread, I accidentally went slightly outside of the event.

Actually, I was on a team with my kids. If THEY had the perk enabled, would that put me at risk of that bug? Or is it only the person using the perk?

In any case, I'll be more mindful of the situation and how this occurs in the future (if at all). I'm pleased that my flux couldn't be stolen...so all he got was a small amount of random junk. Perhaps he logged off so quick because he realized he waxed me for no reason and I might seek revenge. I have his gamer tag...I've never considered whether you can join the world of someone who's not a friend. =) Huh...that would be nice. You gank me...I find your house and lay waste to it... =)"
7155,2020-10-12 20:53:20,j840px,"Mm if your kids had it enabled only they should be at risk. Though you will be prompted and permitted to retaliate, as one of your team is ""under attack"" 

Unfortunately, you have to be accepted as friends to join their world. At least that's the way it goes on PS"
7156,2020-10-13 15:36:08,j840px,"argh...well, revenge will be a long time coming. I don't think the FO76 community is that small that I'll be accidentally joining their world soon. =)

Anyway, thanks for the feedback. I'll be keeping an eye out for this happening again and will note the surroundings and record it."

7158,2020-10-09 19:42:46,j83wur,"I struggle with this type of defense of a position.  Some of the main approaches that he uses that are replicated elsewhere feel like this:

1)  Changing the definition of words.  Translate doesn't mean translate.  Hieroglyphics don't really mean what the people who wrote them intended.

2)  Mutually exclusive arguments.  One works in one situation but if taken at face value tears down other arguments.  Joseph Smith is not smart enough or well read enough to write the BOM.  But Joseph Smith inserted 19th century issues and 19th century philosophical ideas.  If they didn't come from Abinidi and came from Joseph Smith, then he actually was well read enough to have written the BOM.

3)  Someone smarter knows all of this.  If only you were smart enough to understand.  Just have faith.

If someone else' religion was using this type of argument, you would throw them off the porch without blinking an eye.  But when it is close to home, we all swallow a camel without thinking.

JMHO.  :)"

7161,2020-10-09 21:37:29,j83wur,"Great thoughts! I love your curiosity. Your question seems to stem from a frustration with the facts surrounding the Book of Mormon's authenticity, or rather, the lack of facts. It seems you want to know how to justify your faith against the critics? I might be wrong, so I'll just share my thoughts and let you decide.

Moroni (ch. 9) says to use your judgement to spot good. Don't overcomplicate it (his words). Alma said to read the book and if makes you better, ""is not this real?"". (Alma 32).

I love Mormon doctrine, and I want it to be ""true"", but I can't lie to myself and pretend there's a magic power that gives me eyes to see God. I'm agnostic. What's beautiful to me about what the Book of Mormon teaches is that it doesn't need to be ""true"" to be good, which is true of everything in our lives. 

Prophets, your friends and family, neighbors, scholars. We're all just primates staring up trying to make sense of it all."

As rough as it is to write in the present tense, I really like it. The switch from past to present tense in the intro is very effective.

7218,2020-11-09 22:07:14,jqzut4,"This looks REALLY nice, better than when you first published it. But I have a quick question.

Do you have a creation story for this world? Specifically, one that the humans and fey tell and believe in as well as an actual one?

Different ones, of course, if the ""modern"" humans of ""The Burden Egg"" have a creation story. I suspect that whatever religions the humans have left, the ones that survived, would paint the fey as demons serving a god of despair, death, and decay, and that magic is causing the death of the world itself. Case in point, what did the Fey do to the livestock and crops that the humans used? Did the Fey on top of the dragons, hunt the horses and pigs to extinction? Eradicate cattle? Are chickens not extinct? Did they erase every grain of Wheat and Rice on the Earth? Did the Fey notice humanity's close relationship with dogs and casts and decided that they didn't deserve to continue existing? If they did kill all dogs, then did they wipe out the wolves? If they did kill all dogs and wolves, then I think it would pay to see a video on what effect the absence of wolves has on the land they once roamed. Here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysa5OBhXz-Q&ab_channel=SustainableHuman

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gc52l5ZcAJ0&ab_channel=EverythingScience

If Kella *is* to allow mankind enough room to restore their civilization, I think that above recovering the tools to rebuild it, she should prioritize reacquiring the staple crops and animals that can be domesticated. Civilization only arose once humans made enough food that we stopped needing to devote almost every waking moment of our lives to not starving to death. But if the animals and plants we rely on to survive *have* been wiped out, then maybe the humans would've seen it coming, a massive incentive to save a healthy population of all of it in a stasis vault deep underground. And perhaps Kella's relative would know of the more civilian aspects of human civilization, including how to sustain it, you said it here that her line is a family of scholars, which I don't think her uncle would've been excluded from.

And even if the Fey didn't wipe out the crops and kept them for themselves, they would've made sure they're extinct in the wild so that the humans wouldn't be able to use them to feed themselves.

And on top of the ruined cities, in terms of magic and the stability of the world, did the human's downfall have other negative effects on the world and people living in it those of us on Reddit haven't been shown?

So, even if you don't have the answers to these questions, what's the creation story of the world? Human? Fey? And actual? It would be interesting and quite fresh to the Fantasy genre (as far as I'm aware) to see Kella nd humanity have an ally of divine origin.

But of course, God doesn't do everything, and there should be really REALLY good reasons for this in your world as to why ""The god of the Humans"" has done so little. The one I have is this: The God of Mankind swayed events, the downfall of humanity occurred because they grew too immoral, The God of Mankind couldn't do a thing to avert the Empire's fall. He abandoned mankind, but he didn't leave them without hope, he manipulated events to save Hope's egg, and to make sure that nobody would enter that vault for over 2,000 years.

He made sure that nobody found the egg in such a long time to ensure that the weapons that were used to destroy the dragons had either decayed beyond any hope of repair by the Fey's hands, and the few ones that were preserved were destroyed, and due to the Fey's power of prophecy, the last equipment the Fey could use to contest dragons was actually gone for centuries before Kella's birth, I'd say about 500. As for why he's so inactive, maybe when he opens the door for him to interact with the world more directly, another door to the evil realm opens, and an evil god, a devil, would be able to exert influence on the world to the same extent as him.

The reason why he had to wait 500 years after those weapons were destroyed was to avoid triggering the Fey's powers of prophecy and future vision.

**...Wow, okay, uh, sorry, those weren't a quick question. Got a bit carried away.**"
7219,2020-11-09 22:38:09,jqzut4,So you decided to remake it to fit your idea better ? Interesting idea. I hope it will be as interesting as it was before.
7220,2020-11-10 01:53:23,jqzut4,YAY!

7223,2020-11-09 17:40:27,jqzut4,Hope you enjoy it!
7224,2020-11-09 16:01:52,jqzur6,I remember being so high on Anthony Randolph. He was suppose to be the next KG.
7225,2020-11-09 16:37:05,jqzur6,"All of this because Melo wanted to get the most money possible.

Look I get it and I respect it but a part of the narrative that Carmelo never had a good team around him can be blamed on him in my opinion."
7226,2020-11-09 19:11:17,jqzur6,"Error: For some reason, I wrote **D'Angelo Williams** rather than D'Angelo Russell."
7227,2020-11-09 19:08:17,jqzur6,Who the hell is D’Angelo Williams?
7228,2020-11-09 15:52:00,jqzur6,"You bonded the wrong Richardson on the sixers pretty sure
Great stuff"
7229,2020-11-09 15:43:53,jqzur6,Wow nice!
7230,2020-11-10 11:16:35,jqzur6,Holy shit OP is this your job or something?  Excellent work
7231,2020-11-23 02:53:23,jqzur6,Since when did we have the Clippers first rounder next year thats pretty sweet
7232,2020-11-09 17:07:16,jqzur6,he had all the physical tools but 0 bbiq
7233,2020-11-09 22:07:29,jqzur6,"Back in one of the 2ks (12? Maybe older, dont remember), he and MCW were the stars of my Under-25 Repeat champ Bulls team. Still have that save file XD"
7234,2020-11-09 17:14:19,jqzur6,I thought Sim Bhullar would be the next Shaq
7235,2020-11-09 22:31:33,jqzur6,08-09 nuggets were really good though
7236,2020-11-09 18:47:43,jqzur6,I just don't get why people put the trade blame on him. I understand he didn't help lol. But its his agents job to get him the most money. Neither Melo nor his agent had the authority to sign off on such a trade.
7237,2020-11-09 17:40:33,jqzur6,"Had he signed into cap space to New York, they could have traded those pieces for another star. Worse case scenario Gallo is a great piece to have in an offensive system with D'Anthony and Chandler could work as a pretty good 6th man. In hindsight we know that Dwight became available 2 years later."
7238,2020-11-09 19:59:16,jqzur6,Running back for the Carolina Panthers.
7239,2020-11-09 19:11:37,jqzur6,"oops, i can't change errors because it's too many characters."
7240,2020-11-10 13:20:57,jqzur6,nah I'm in college. Thank you though
7241,2020-11-09 18:44:34,jqzur6,Had the whole smoker but none of the meat
7242,2020-11-09 21:02:08,jqzur6,BY GOD THAT'S JOSH SMITH'S MUSIC!
7243,2020-11-09 22:42:28,jqzur6,"I've been playing 2k11 for laughs, Knicks are unstoppable with their Anthony Randolph/Gallo/Stat front court (this is prior to the Melo trade)"
7244,2020-11-09 23:07:09,jqzur6,dude was a 20/12 machine on 60% fg after a few years because the potential attribute is busted
7245,2020-11-09 19:13:47,jqzur6,"Shaq wasn't just big, he was ridiculously athletic for his size.

Sim could barely walk, there was never a shot at him becoming a great basketball player."
7246,2020-11-10 08:17:05,jqzur6,Man you never watched that guy play he looks crippled when he moves his legs
7247,2020-11-09 20:01:13,jqzur6,"Which is fine as I admitted in my previous comment, I'm just saying that he has made a lot of bad decisions that took him out of championship contention to have the narrative that his teams were never good enough. Maybe if he allowed the core to stay there and didn't require picks to get involved he would have a better squad around him in NY that he loved so much."
7248,2020-11-10 05:39:30,jqzur6,You’re right in the sense that the Knicks ended up bidding against themselves because Dolan was impatient and paranoid the Nets would swoop in.
7249,2020-11-09 20:16:19,jqzur6,Partial blame on the uncertainty surrounding that off seasons lockout
7250,2020-11-22 08:09:17,jqzur6,Kinda like Kenny George 😕
7251,2020-11-10 12:01:24,jqzur6,You can't teach 7 ft 5 🤷🏾‍♂️
7252,2020-11-09 20:09:04,jqzur6,"No I hear you I just don't see why its Melo not allowing the core to stay there as opposed to James Dolan. Like no one ever says, ""Wow Paul George negotiated all these draft picks for the Thunder."" So why do a lot of people say, ""Melo should not have gotten core players or picks involved"" you know what I mean? I get that he could have just signaled to the Knicks that he would sign in free agency. Boom problem solved. But if I'm Melo then I'm thinking ""the knicks have all the leverage in the world since I'm a UFA in a couple months, they will probably trade 1 asset for me"", I still don't get why they traded the whole damn house for a guy they had a 75% (if not higher) chance of signing for free. 

&#x200B;

It was a stupid trade no doubt but it was the GMs decision to make"
7253,2020-11-09 22:34:46,jqzur6,I think it's mainly due to PG going to teams to be the 2nd banana and Melo was going to NY to be the man. The Melo case is why I am always going to think players need to never seek a trade before they leave as a superstar status player.
7254,2020-11-10 08:19:25,jqzur6,"I mean, it worked out pretty well for Anthony Davis; and Kawhi Leonard, and Kevin Love, and Shaq, and Kevin Garnett. 

But sure, we should listen to your advice on the subject"
7255,2020-11-10 14:41:27,jqzur6,"They all went to teams with elite supporting players
AD- Bron

Kawhi - They were 1st in the east and DeRozan wasn't that good

Kevin Love - Bron

Shaq - Wade

KG - Pierce and Allen

Knicks gutted their roster for Melo."
7256,2020-11-09 15:34:54,jqzp8s,I totally forgot about Haskins
7257,2020-11-09 15:35:27,jqzp8s,Rivera with the subtlety of a kick in the nuts with his criticism.
7258,2020-11-09 15:57:25,jqzp8s,"Rivera on Haskins after cutting him: ""This is good for Dwayne. He'll get an opportunity to get a real job and see how average people live and hopefully Dwayne can get used to driving a used Camry. This is an opportunity to downsize and enjoy the little things in life."""
7259,2020-11-09 15:37:19,jqzp8s,Why do I get the feeling that if Smith gets hurt Rivera would sooner go Wildcat full time before putting Haskins back in?
7260,2020-11-09 18:13:00,jqzp8s,"Man, Haskin's is totally in the dog house with Rivera lmao 

I think it's fair to say this response by Rivera is nothing but media fluff."
7261,2020-11-09 16:44:22,jqzp8s,Dwayne totally fucked Rivera's daughter
7262,2020-11-09 18:58:06,jqzp8s,It’s weird to see Rivera so openly critical of a player on his team. He’d talk about players needing to execute in Carolina but he never talked like this
7263,2020-11-09 15:35:02,jqzp8s,The team formerly known as the redskins and throwing shade at their players. Name a more iconic duo
7264,2020-11-09 15:55:30,jqzp8s,They should’ve shut their mouth about how bad he was and traded him for something
7265,2020-11-09 20:39:16,jqzp8s,Perhaps Haskins went to Ohio State because he didn’t know how to play school.
7266,2020-11-09 22:05:47,jqzp8s,Is Haskins the next EJ Manuel?
7267,2020-11-09 15:41:30,jqzp8s,"READ: Remember we still have this guy, please somebody make an offer for him."
7268,2020-11-09 20:41:13,jqzp8s,Honestly it might not bode well with Haskins but it’s probably a good learning experience and done to humble him a bit.
7269,2020-11-09 21:43:46,jqzp8s,"You can read that sarcastically, but Patrick Mahomes studied under Alex Smith for a year and he turned out OK. Patrick and his dad praise Alex every chance they get for everything Alex taught him. He might be pretty good at the mentoring thing."
7270,2020-11-09 22:42:56,jqzp8s,Idk why but when I read Dwayne my mind went to Dwayne Bowe
7271,2020-11-09 16:12:48,jqzp8s,"I love Smith as much as anyone, but he absolutely doesn’t look the same as he was before, and probably never will (hope to God I am wrong on this part).

What made Smith good was that he was an underrated runner. And he looked off as a game manager.

I don’t want Smith to go out like this."
7272,2020-11-09 16:00:17,jqzp8s,"lol I had the same reaction.  ""Who the hell is Dwayne? ... OH YAH!"""
7273,2020-11-09 19:36:10,jqzp8s,Isn't that the UDFA RB in Miami? Or was it that lady from Tiger King?
7274,2020-11-09 18:00:43,jqzp8s,As bad as Haskins apparently is Rivera is handling the entire situation even worse lol
7275,2020-11-09 17:17:28,jqzp8s,"Fuck it, let Gibson cook."
7276,2020-11-09 19:52:22,jqzp8s,"""Riverboat deez nuts! Cancer is for bitches!""

-Dwayne Haskins, probably


Might explain things"
7277,2020-11-09 22:22:28,jqzp8s,"I mean it's actually possible. She's grown and single, from what I could tell"
7278,2020-11-09 21:39:24,jqzp8s,"It is really weird. I have been following the Panthers since 2014 and I can't remember Rivera ever acting like this towards one of his players. My thought is that either Haskins was deliberately not listening to his coaches, or Ron just thinks he needs a fire lit under his ass."
7279,2020-11-09 22:18:21,jqzp8s,Maybe Haskins said something like “I’m the star QB what’re you going do?” and we’re watching it all unfold
7280,2020-11-09 19:35:33,jqzp8s,Probably because he never had a player as lazy as Haskins before
7281,2020-11-09 18:35:11,jqzp8s,Rivera really is a perfect fit. Only better options might have been arians or hue jackson
7282,2020-11-10 03:22:12,jqzp8s,EJ Manuel has a few good games.
7283,2020-11-09 18:42:10,jqzp8s,Trade deadline was last week
7284,2020-11-09 16:20:14,jqzp8s,Well he came into the game down 20-3 lmao. How you expect him to be a game manager in that situation?
7285,2020-11-09 23:17:34,jqzp8s,Smith was destroying us in the 2nd half until those last few passes completely undid everything. I actually thought he looked way better than he'd looked in his game earlier. He was zipping the ball around and was super accurate at times.
7286,2020-11-09 22:15:20,jqzp8s,I laughed so hard at this because I had the exact same reaction hahaha
7287,2020-11-10 06:40:48,jqzp8s,I thought it was an ice cream shop
7288,2020-11-09 18:07:06,jqzp8s,"Agreed, Rivera constantly calling Haskins lazy to the media is tired and not going to help anyone. This is not what we brought him in for as far as changing the culture. Looks more like our toxicity changed him."
7289,2020-11-09 19:32:15,jqzp8s,Rather see scary terry back there
7290,2020-11-10 00:07:41,jqzp8s,Cooking with Gibs.
7291,2020-11-09 21:41:08,jqzp8s,"For god sakes, we are the ones that drafted Kelvin Benjamin. I think Ron has dealt with laziness before.

I'm guessing that Haskins doesn't have the best work ethic and/or he's deliberately going against his coaches. Those are the only reasons I could see for Ron calling him out so often."
7292,2020-11-09 17:46:58,jqzp8s,"Some of his passes felt a little off, like it looked the speed of the passes looked quite a bit slower than usual. 

And he came into the game down 10-0 in the first quarter. That is still plenty of time to manage the game, is it not?"
7293,2020-11-10 00:09:45,jqzp8s,He was like 20/23 at one point. Dude just choked in the end.
7294,2020-11-09 18:18:49,jqzp8s,"I don't get what advantage there is to signaling to everyone that Haskins is not putting in effort. If he keeps Haskins around it doesn't do their relationship any favors, and if he wants to move on from Haskins these comments hurt Haskin's trade value. I guess he's hoping it will light a fire under Haskins, but idk."
7295,2020-11-09 21:06:40,jqzp8s,"Probably unpopular opinion but I disagree, Dwayne has to have known what he was getting into before going pro. I don’t blame coach for giving him shit. Lord knows if a player is having a hard time with their coach, the player sings like a bird. Hopefully Dwayne will take it in stride but wouldn’t surprise if he wilts and becomes the Dante Pettis of quarterbacks."
7296,2020-11-09 18:21:24,jqzp8s,"I had no prior opinion of Rivera, but JDR is toxic trash and its telling that was his pick for DC. Sucks for you guys, but I think it will get worse before it gets better."
7297,2020-11-09 20:37:29,jqzp8s,"Nah Ron ALWAYS threw his players under the bus. Dude has never taken responsibility for his terribly coaching.

It's a big reason Panthers were ready to move on"
7298,2020-11-09 22:27:39,jqzp8s,"Telling him in public his accuracy sucks or he crumbles under pressure doesn't help him. He doesn't choose to miss passes or get flustered. Telling him he's lazy might, since all he has to do is choose to work harder...

I'm confused why you would be upset about these comments. Haskins is obviously lazy, and if he doesn't change his habits (which apparently he has hasn't), he's not the one. So why would you be upset about the way Rivera is handling this? If you give him a qb that doesn't work, there's nothing for any coach to handle."
7299,2020-11-09 21:09:47,jqzp8s,"You can run but you can’t hide, bitch"
7300,2020-11-09 21:59:57,jqzp8s,"See, I found the problem. Haskins can't be bribed with food."
7301,2020-11-09 22:19:07,jqzp8s,But Ron was involved in drafting him. Ron was not involved in Dan forcing the Dwayne pick.
7302,2020-11-09 21:55:17,jqzp8s,You don't get anywhere by fleecing teams into taking your dead weight.  If anything it's better to overestimate the downside to protect your reputation and make the opposition's outlook rosier in comparison.
7303,2020-11-09 21:13:12,jqzp8s,"For a lot of reasons I’m not sure. I think he’s a classic example of a guy who had it easy up through college and got hit by the train of what it takes to prepare and play in the pros. If the guy is lazy then he’s lazy. If he doesn’t want to wake up at 5AM then he’s not gonna do it. Motivation has to come from inside, not from public excoriations from a coach to a 23 year old person. If this is the case, let him sulk on the bench for the next couple years and move on."
7304,2020-11-09 20:15:16,jqzp8s,"Our defense has been incredible under JDR though. He’s by far our best coordinator/assistant.

Edit: we went from 28th overall in yards given up in 2019 to 5th overall so far this year. And yeah, I know that yards isn’t everything, but it’s been a monumental shift."
7305,2020-11-09 22:41:55,jqzp8s,"I don’t really recall him throwing his guys under the bus in Carolina, if he did he wouldn’t have been loved by his players as much as he was. There’s a lot of legitimate criticisms about ron as a coach, let’s not make stuff up."
7306,2020-11-10 06:45:29,jqzp8s,How is Haskins laziness obvious? All I've seen is tweets.
7307,2020-11-09 21:10:13,jqzp8s,OUT THERE! Not in here.....
7308,2020-11-09 22:10:32,jqzp8s,"Sure you do, just ask the Cardinals. I don't think Kliff is worried to much about his reputation after that trade. The one who got fleeced is who looks bad not the one doing the fleecing.

What about how you guys sent AB to Oakland knowing he was batshit crazy? Do people refuse to deal with the Steeler's franchise now because they were able to mask the severity of his craziness?"
7309,2020-11-09 20:28:01,jqzp8s,Isn't Rivera a defensive guy though? JR'S scheme was terrible for us.
7310,2020-11-09 20:20:48,jqzp8s,The defense sucks and the line is underperforming. It’s not Haskins that gives up multiple TDs in the first half every game.
7311,2020-11-09 20:32:34,jqzp8s,"I think a part of why your defense is looking better is your competition has been really really bad. Being in a historically bad NFC East is definitely helping your numbers, plus Ron himself is a defensive minded coach and generally had solid units in Carolina. Hard to distinguish if Ron or Rio had more impact on that improvement."
7312,2020-11-10 00:12:15,jqzp8s,"The AB trade proves my point, not yours.  Before the AB trade, we dealt Martavis Bryant to Oakland for a 3rd.  Had we been short sighted in our dealings with Bryant, Oakland wouldn't have worked with us to obtain AB, who was both biblically crazy and demanding a trade at the time that deal was made.

It's not the coaches who have to worry about a franchises reputation, it's the owners."
7313,2020-11-09 20:29:39,jqzp8s,"Yeah he was hired as a defensive-minded coach. It’s been well-documented that JDR has stepped up while Rivera was getting his cancer treatments and such. 

I’m not a huge fan of the dude himself, but watching all of the games and looking at the metrics, our defense is vastly improved."
7314,2020-11-09 21:50:11,jqzp8s,"Did you even watch the the game yesterday? The offense/special teams had 5 TURNOVERS.

How the hell do you not expected the defense to get gassed/frustrated?"
7315,2020-11-10 00:22:44,jqzp8s,"You burned em on Bryant too lol. He only started 2 games for them and they gave y'all a 3rd for that. You knew that man couldn't put his bong down and traded him anyway. Ruthless as it should be and guess what, after getting taking to the cleaners the first time they came right back and said *please sir may I have another* before you paddled em AB style."
7316,2020-11-10 01:54:32,jqzp8s,what also probably helps is the absolute studs you guys have accumulated on the DL
7317,2020-11-09 22:05:39,jqzp8s,The defense is allowed to play better in the beginning of the game when what happens on offense doesn’t matter as much. Maybe the defense giving up points in the beginning is what makes the offense have to press?
7318,2020-11-10 02:37:31,jqzp8s,"Alright the Steelers aren't maybe the best example.. Gruden knew what he was getting into on both trades, though.  Its kind of his thing to give players like Bryant and Brown a chance to respond to his coaching.. Both are exceedingly gifted, and had they turned out like Waller, it would've been a great value for him.

Taking advantage of a GMs inflated ego isn't the same as selling them a lemon.. But I concede the point, well argued."
7319,2020-11-10 02:55:31,jqzp8s,"That’s an interesting point. After all the Defense strength is the D-Line. Our corners seem to give up on big play every quarter (except for Fuller, that guy is a beast)."
7320,2020-11-09 15:26:12,jqzbm0,"Agree with above, the infusions are how you craft magic armor/weapons. Having the right tool for the job is not a class feature meant to craft magic items specifically."
7321,2020-11-09 15:22:06,jqzbm0,"> Building magical items is an important part of the Artificer 

No, it's really not. You have your infusions, *that's* the important 'magic item' part of the artificer. You don't even get any bonuses to crafting until like way higher levels so you don't need to worry about crafting more than anyone else does until that level."
7322,2020-11-09 15:28:03,jqzbm0,"This is really a conversation you need to have with your DM in regards to expectations for your character and the game. Crafting does take a lot of time and resources, and often times the game itself is not set up in a way that is conducive to supporting that. If you're playing an adventure that goes from level 1-10 completely out in the wilds with no return to where your home base may be, then yes, crafting will be difficult if not impossible. 

However, if you play a slower paced, more sandbox type of game where your adventuring party may have breaks of weeks or month of game time between adventuring, than you can make the crafting a bit part of things. A great adventure hook for your DM can be the pursuit of crafting ingredients. Want to make your fighter a Flametongue longsword? That requires the heart of a Fire Primordial. That's a cool adventure that may only take up a single game night to complete.

But, again this is all a conversation you need to have with your DM before character creation and game start to set expectations."
7323,2020-11-09 18:27:08,jqzbm0,"You should be wanting to play an Artificer for their actual class features, not for a system that isn't implemented in the way you want for _any_ character.

The only suggestion we can give you for that is ""talk to your DM"" about reducing the crafting times and whatnot. That's it.

>What's the point of being able to craft my fighter a +2 longsword if it means we have to wait in town for a month?

Well, the point is you can make a +2 longsword without _dying_, for one. Adventuring is dangerous. The vast majority of people would rather take a month to do something in town that could be done in days in a dungeon, just to avoid being eaten by a mimic or suffering horrific pain and dismemberment-by-trap.

If the crafting rules being too ""slow"" for you makes you switch from Artificer to another class (who would also have no easier of a time with them - and in fact a harder one), it sounds like you weren't actually wanting to play the Artificer class so much as a ""crafter"", which 5e doesn't support all that well (at least on an adventuring time table)."
7324,2020-11-09 15:25:46,jqzbm0,"Remember, you can hire someone to help. The time it takes to make something is divided by whoever is helping, and the rules are much more lax on what took proficiency someone needs if they’re only helping. There’s also set prices on how much hiring people costs. 

Also, buy a cart for traveling. Now you can craft anything that doesn’t need a forge, so long as you have the proficiency, or get any work done that doesn’t require a forge anyway. 

Now I know the rules aren’t there for this, but also consider perhaps buying components to save time. Making a +2 longsword? Perhaps ask your DM if you can by a sword, and take the base weapon, then infuse it with your material to save out on time. Reducing your cost from the +2 longsword and dividing time from there should work

Edit: also I just want to add, I am also playing an artificer. It’s fun as hell, and the crafting is damn rewarding. But also consider that you don’t need to look at +2 longsword for a while. That’s a rare weapon, you’ll need to kill a CR9 creature to do that. By this point, crafting will be so easy. Hire 3 other assistants, get the whole thing don’t in 2 and a half weeks (also not continuous work). If your DM is nice, he may also let you get a portable forge. Be creative, but rest assured the base class of artificer and it’s subclasses are fun"
7325,2020-11-09 15:30:24,jqzbm0,"If the reason you want to play an Artificer is because you find downtime crafting rules appealing, then don't play an artificer - every other class can access those rules too, and with similar levels of effectiveness (because your DM has full control over whether or not you can actually craft anything)."
7326,2020-11-09 15:43:44,jqzbm0,"If you want to play an armourer character and make armour and weapons for the party, Forge Cleric is another option. Their channel divinity lets them make stuff using an hour long ritual, as long as the price is under 100 gold."
7327,2020-11-09 16:00:19,jqzbm0,"> The only problem is that the crafting rules for 5e require a lot of time, in-game and out, to make anything worth while.

This is why I made time-locked crafting optional in my games. It's cool to have the ""life long project"" the tinker is working on, but eventually it gets to a point where making mundane items is just a chore."
7328,2020-11-09 19:56:04,jqzbm0,"No, playing a crafting artificer is really fun.

I played one who set up a shop as a weapons engineer and made ton of money, as well as geared up & employed the party.

You have to get really inventive, though, and I was poring over the item tables in the PHB for hours like ""what can I make""

eventually, i came out with a makeshift rocket launcher (heavily modified heavy crossbow, portable ram with explosives strapped to it), Quadbow (the flagship, quadruple crossbow), shotgun (crossbow with special ammunition that was designed to explode into flak)

**These are all very expensive and until Eberron gets tech to mass produce these, I can only make about 1 per month**"
7329,2020-11-09 18:51:51,jqzbm0,"im kind of in this same boat right now.  I want to outfit the team with better stuff as i have made a renaissance dwarf character who can do it all.  but my dm doesn't want to give me the time 

the artificer gives you the powers but does a lot of handwaving through infusions.  sure i can call anything a bag of holding but i also want to make stuff too.  and you really dont get the crafting power until lvl 11

&#x200B;

in the game i ran, i just gave a year of downtime to my players and the lvl 14 artificer cranked out so many magic items it was nuts it was really cool and he got a lot out of it.  it would be worth asking for some time    


ive found the DMG rules better they are a little more standardized but  the xanathars rules might make the process more active for your Dm and easier to swallow"
7330,2020-11-09 21:32:55,jqzbm0,"Artificer crafting use is campaign dependent, you have to rely on downtime from your dm and your ability to craft magic items doesn't really get better til level 10."
7331,2020-11-10 06:59:48,jqzbm0,"As other people have stated Artificer Infusions are made instantly and last as long as you let them last, so you needn't worry about your Infusions taking too long to make. That being said if you want to make long lasting magic items consider talking to your DM about your expectations for crafting. Again like people have said you're not going to need to mass produce magic items until really late into the game."
7332,2020-11-10 07:25:04,jqzbm0,"This is where your DM comes in

Sure the book says something will take a month...

Or maybe your dm is cool with you needing to go on a quest for some rare resource and once you have it you can make the thing in a night.

Talk to the dm about what they want to do with you."
7333,2020-11-09 21:10:51,jqzbm0,"Truth be told, the artificer is a bit... poo, as a base class. Once you start getting your higher level stuff (level 11+), the class gets much better.

As a DM who runs a game with a high level artificer though, I will say that the class benefits from a DM who is open to creative ideas from the player. Depending on what sort of world the DM runs, it can be a fantastic idea to build on technology through an artificer PC. For example, in my world, our high-level artificer PC has basically just started a sort of industrial revolution."
7334,2020-11-10 00:37:52,jqzbm0,"You straight up are not meant to craft magic items.

Artificer revolves around infusions. You tinker some items make them magic. You can do this for 2-6 items at a time depending on your level. The catch is you can redo your infusion when you feel like it. Your fighter want to swap from longsword to greatsword, no problem you just remove your infusion form his longsword and put it on his greatsword.

You don't have access to all magic items, but a pretty good selection. You get up to +2 weapons and armor and a bunch of good utility items.

Keep in mind this temporary infusing has big advantages too. For example you make a mystery key, use it, and just make another one tomorrow. Need to hide some bodies or make something go away? Stuff it in your bag of holding then intentionally rupture the bad. All the trash inside your bag goes to the Astral plane and you just make a new bag tomorrow."
7335,2020-11-09 17:13:14,jqzbm0,"They sort of suck tho, at least until level 10. Besides you might be able to share the infusions but you would be gimping yourself at trading away a part of your class power."
7336,2020-11-09 23:26:06,jqzbm0,Usually you need to find patterns to make items. Artificers know all the patterns for their infusions. That's how they are better item makers than other classes.
7337,2020-11-09 20:41:13,jqzbm0,">Remember, you can hire someone to help. The time it takes to make something is divided by whoever is helping, and the rules are much more lax on what took proficiency someone needs if they’re only helping. There’s also set prices on how much hiring people costs. 

This! A skilled worker is just 2g a day, which depending on the item could save you in the long term.

Time and other costs are put in the game both for gold sinks *and* to require an investment for just custom tailoring magic items to fit your needs."
7338,2020-11-09 19:19:12,jqzbm0,"I disagree that they suck, having played an Artificer to Level 15. +1 Weapons/Armor are never bad, and there's a few other interesting infusions like Repulsion Shield, Radiant Weapon, and Boots of the Winding Path. That's not even considering Replicate Magic Item, and while the level 2 options are mostly fluff and minor benefits, the level 6 stuff is legitimately useful - bonuses to stealth, free casting of charm person, a nice fear effect, etc. 

And it's only ""gimping"" yourself to give items to an ally if you don't consider what that item helps them achieve as part of your success. Sure, you're not doing as much damage, but if you're helping your paladin hit more often and do an extra point of damage (and maybe blind the enemy) when he does, you're contributing. I don't see it any different than spending an action to cast something like Bless, except that they always get the benefit."
7339,2020-11-10 06:54:12,jqzbm0,"Bag of Holding at level 2, unlimited crossbow bolts, Wand of the War Mage at level 2, insane Bonus Action economy, Cleric's Potent Spellcasting (or an Extra Attack) at level 5, Bardic Inspiration as a reaction, and having nearly all your class features by 9th level would like to have a word with you."
7340,2020-11-09 23:28:47,jqzbm0,Not by RAW.
7341,2020-11-10 00:25:41,jqzbm0,"there are no RAW rules for needing a blueprint, it's a vague suggestion at best."
7342,2020-11-09 19:48:21,jqzbm0,"I agree so much, I view artificers as long rest, long term support. Infusions are amazing, sure +2 ac is nice for you but what about +2 ac for your fighter. We have a dwarf barbarian with dwarven fortitude so he love my periapt of wound closure. One thing you don’t touch on is the spell storing item. I see a lot of player view it as personal power when I find it helpful to share. You can pass it around and have full party stealth, spider climb, enhance ability. For no spell slots. Or you could put something like scorching ray and give one of you martials a ranged attack (even the barbarian since it is using a magic item not casting a spell)."
7343,2020-11-09 19:57:54,jqzbm0,"I feel the same way. artificers don't only optimise themselves, artificers optimise the party"
7344,2020-11-10 06:57:58,jqzbm0,"The biggest asset Artificers have is the ability to give infusions to the party. Sure, using Infusions for yourself is great, but the only thing more fun than a Warlock Invocation is a Warlock Invocation you can give the party. In all the games where I've played an Artificer my ability to give the party magic items has resulted in them being a lot stronger and having a lot more fun. Gave the Warlock +2 to their Eldritch Blasts, gave the Paladin a viable ranged weapon, gave the Fighter AC to frustrate the DM.

Not to mention that there are a lot of items that almost exclusively expect you to give them to the team, like the Bag of Holding (community item), Sending Stones (someone else in the party has to have the second stone), and all the items that set your stats to 19."

Quite enjoyable to write. Especially as they have broken a many years long writer’s drought. 

I do start to get why real writers have editors. While I see a certain progress, some of the passages are.... not good. Lol.

We’ll see how Thorin progresses. Only level 24. But I cheated on the mutagen perks and consoled them in when the appropriate story based lore/mechanics conditions are met. Which is why Thorin had to be in a sacred pool within the forest to apply the spriggan mutagen.

I am also playing with the Better Spell Learning mod installed. This actually means that Thorin will have to spend significant in game time to study spell tomes to learn them. Which means that he actually know very few spells. 

Spell research is also obviously in as the mechanism where Thorin discovers his abilities. Though the sun fire spell was learned through levels and not from a priest. But it made sense as he is now in quite high favor with Stendarr and a glory surround him whenever he meditates (Wintersun mod)

As one might have noticed I usually play mages. Hence all the internal monologues about why things work. His sensing of things around him is more of a mysticism, now alteration thing, but he only have one perk point in alteration.

Each one has a pretty extensive backstory. Did you start Thorin's journal at level 1? I'm thinking it may be a good idea to start at level 10 or something so you get the tedium of the first 10 levels out of the way, but there's pretty crucial character development that can happen then too. 

How often are you writing these entries? Do you write as you play the game or do you play first, then write? I actually have two instances of each character. One is a roleplaying/journaling one, and the other is just for playing, since it does get quite tedious to write and play at the same time.

Re: your mod comment - is the combat one compatible with ultimate skyrim? Is your better spell learning compatible as well? Both look and sound much more immersive, which I'm a big fan of."
7414,2020-11-16 15:02:15,jqyw23,Weapon animations change based on skill and weapon type. Unique weapons also have unique animations.
7415,2020-11-09 22:39:53,jqyw23,"I am on UltSky so all my custom mods are at least an attempt to be compatible. Although I not make my own patches.

Thorin started at level 1. I wrote as I played. Stopping at natural places to write down his thoughts. I actually did not find Hroggar for several days in game. The Troll did slaughter the guards. The frost spider did jump him. 
So most everything is organically played. There are some changes to order in the later chapters just because of traveling back and forth with loot and then doing something while in the city.

For example I started in Morthal because I wanted Hoth early. But surroundings are not very suitable at very low levels. So the letter from Ingrod was a nice excuse to get Thorin out of there before he could progress further and get killed by requiem vampires. It was meta knowledge that made him stay away from graveyard at night, but with Hoth on board he just whipped her down in a second. Did not even get off a shot. But then the husband actually arrived. And char could accuse Alva, and he did vehemently deny Thorins accusation that she is a vampire. 

That is when the letter delivery to Danica made sense. Thorin was not making friends with his accusations. 

And so forth. I played until something interesting happened that would get Thorin to think things through and reflect on what is happening. 

He do want to figure out what happened with his sister. But does not want to make accusations, so he needed to develop some way of sensing vampires.

But I am consciously not playing a mage. But a HA twohander. And I have never played as one before. So how to be able to investigate if a knucklehead who never levels magicka?

So the inner monologue about how he cope with challenges (alchemy for healing, smithing for weapons going for arcane smith perk for ranged capability for certain flying monsters, but no leveling of marksman. Because he uses the crossbow as one/two shot opening salvo before pulling his sword out.)

He is now basically driven to excel due to feeling of helplessness in the early levels, and to solve the mystery in the beginning. But at a stage where he can survive an ebony vampire without sunburst and my other mage arsenal.

The spell weaponry mod seems extremely suited for him. And with going for all alchemical mutagens in R-CAO (console in mutagen perks as appropriate as the mod add in many more perks to the alchemy tree, basically nerfing it big time), and full on alchemical mastery to unlock bombs, oils, and other fun in conjunction with arcane smithing perk, this could become a very interesting and for me totally different playthrough."
7416,2020-11-16 15:19:44,jqyw23,"Yeah, I saw that based on the mod description. Do you know if it conflicts with other animation mods? I have a few from the pinned post in the customization tab of the discord. Did you customize it like it says in the article on the mod page at all or just installed it and it works?"
7417,2020-11-09 23:21:31,jqyw23,"Thanks for the insight. I’m about to post my first one, and I’d love your input!"
7418,2020-11-16 16:27:22,jqyw23,"I customized it like in the article.

I changed out FNIS with Nemesis.

I added various other DAR animations, but this is the only combat one. 

Nemesis detects SkySA and makes sure it works well in game. So after you have installed all animations, run nemesis from MO2"

I love how much you love Iridescence. It's my go to BH album when I wanna listen to a whole concept/mood. It's probably my #1 as well, though I dont like picking favourites.

I tend to forget about Sat 2 and listen to Sat 3 more. 

But I gotta disagree with ATT, I totally get why the boys dont technically claim it as one, and why you think it's just ok. It is essentially a demo. But it's a bloody good demo and I love Michigan/Palace/Infatuation. 

I dont find Sat1 to have many outstanding tracks, though GOLD has grown on me again. But like you say. HEAT is a fucken banger. It's the stand out track on Sat 1.

Ginger is a hard one for me to rank cause you gotta be in the right mood for it, and when you are, its brilliant. But if your not, it changes your emotion. J think lyrically its outstanding. Joba on BIG BOY and LOVE ME FOR LIFE  is some of his best work.

7565,2020-11-09 18:24:52,jqxyb4,"Some more prospects that didn't fit into the post limit --

**(19) PF Patrick Williams, Florida State**

Athletic forward Patrick Williams is a polarizing figure in this draft. Some pundits have him in the top 10; others barely consider him a R1 talent. It's difficult to know with any certainty, because Williams declared after starting 0/29 games as a freshman. To be fair, it wouldn't be unprecedented for a backup to go in the first round. Famously, Marvin Williams went # 2. Corey Maggette and Dion Waiters were also top 10 picks despite not starting for their college teams. This Williams has a pretty solid excuse as well, as we've already mentioned that Florida State had a good and deep program where players tend to wait their turn.

Still, it'd be hard for me to justify a lottery pick for Williams given what we've seen so far. He's a live body with good athleticism and strength. As far as his skill set goes, there's plenty of room to grow. He only hit 32% of his threes, and his assist/TO ratio of 1.0/1.7 suggests he can hone his basketball IQ as well. While he has theoretical upside given his physical profile, NBA benches are littered with good athletes who never quite figured out their niche.

In the right system, Williams may development into a starter, but it's unknown how long that'll take. Denver's Jerami Grant had a breakout playoffs this year, but he's 26. The team that drafts Williams should hope he can get to that level a little sooner.

***best fits***

Minnesota has the # 1 pick, but they also have # 17. Patrick Williams could fit them there as an active PF and defensive complement to center Karl-Anthony Towns. He'd also make some sense with Brooklyn (#19). Williams doesn't project as a sharpshooter, but the Nets have a pair of pretty good shooters in house.

***worst fits***

We mentioned a possible Jerami Grant comp already, which would make Denver (#22) an odd fit if they re-sign the actual Grant. I'd say the same about Philadelphia (#21), who is already stacked with frontcourt talent."
7566,2020-11-09 14:27:12,jqxyb4,I've been very much wanting to draft Poku as a Spurs fan. if it was possible to trade back with the Celtics or Mavs for a pick or two and a player then I'd be super happy to take him since he's the highest ceiling player in this draft to me. he isn't quite Jokic but he's an insane passer. his top end comp for me is like a hybrid of Porzingis and Jokic with better better mobility than either. only real weakness is strength. he's a guy who has rebounding and shot blocking instincts and a lot of length. I'm really not worried about him unless it's Embiid and Jokic he's guarding but they cook on everyone anyway.
7567,2020-11-09 15:32:15,jqxyb4,"> I'd project that [Edwards] can become an average (35-36%) three-point shooter in time.

I'm thinking the same; he'll be in that range or maybe *slightly* lower, and able to do it on high volume and degree of difficulty. Some reasons why I believe this:

**1**- Remember that this was college basketball's first season with a further back 3 point line and 3P% was down across the entire nation. This is the first time we're evaluating draft prospects with this deeper line.

**2**- Edwards is a 29% 3P shooter the same way Luka is a 31% 3P shooter...these guys' percentages are determined a lot by the high volume of step back and pull up 3's they take. Part of this is that Edwards' shot selection needing a lot of work but you probably won't be a star in the NBA as a guard if you won't take and can't make unassisted 3's off the dribble.

**3**- Lastly, his FT% is good and there's a reasonable correlation between that and NBA 3P %.

Torn on seeing **Vassell** at 6. I could see him being a very pedestrian offensive player; he doesn't dribble very much, doesn't have a quick first step, and rarely does finesse finishes. You're right that he looks like a future 3-and-D guy, which means that his offensive value hinges deeply on that catch-and-shoot 3P%. I don't have a feeling if he's headed towards a ""meh"" 35% or a great 38+. But I suppose he'll have some value in either of those cases as long as his defense is as good as advertised (I believe it is), thus the belief that he has a high floor. 

I'd put Hayes over Vassell, but he's probably top 10.  I have to learn more about these other prospects and watch some video to round out the rest of my list. This write up is well done and is a good starting point for some of these guys that I'm not familiar with."
7568,2020-11-09 18:23:44,jqxyb4,"Some more prospects that didn't fit into the post limit --

**(16) SF Saddiq Bey, Villanova**

Villanova veteran Saddiq Bey also meets the desire for 3+D wings who can blend in and surround a team's stars. Hell, he hit 45% of his threes this year! Better still, his 6'8"" size should allow him to play SG, SF, and even some smallball PF. Villanova players tend to have strong discipline and professionalism, which only makes him feel like a safer bet.

The reason that Bey ranks below some less polished 3+D players (like Isaac Okoro or Josh Green) is the lack of perceived upside. He's already 22.5 years old, and there's some concern that his 3 and D may not be upper level on either end. His shooting form doesn't look great, and is reflected in mediocre FT%. His defensive stats (0.8 steals, 0.4 blocks) don't suggest a star defender either. He should be OK in both facets, with an emphasis on ""OK."" If you draft Bey, you should be looking for a solid single and not a home run. 

***best fits***

Sacramento (#12) is the highest I can justify Saddiq Bey going. He can develop behind Harrison Barnes, and eventually take his place in the lineup. He'd also make sense for the teams looking for bigger bodies at SF, which include New Orleans (#13) and Portland (#16).

***worst fits***

With Saddiq Bey, you're not going to worry too much about the ""bust"" factor. However, some teams like San Antonio (#11) probably need a bigger swing for the fences. Their ""win now"" team isn't winning much right now, and it'll be time for a broader rebuild soon."
7569,2020-11-09 18:24:05,jqxyb4,"Some more prospects that didn't fit into the post limit --

**(17) PF/C Jalen Smith, Maryland**

Although Jalen Smith was a bluechip recruit in high school, he went under the radar over the course of his two year college career. His lack of buzz should be an NBA team's gain. The bespectacled one has the qualities that you'd want in a modern stretch big. He shot 37% from three this season, and blocked 2.4 shots per game.

Smith doesn't move around as fluidly as someone like Onyeka Okongwu, which makes me think he'll spend most of his time as a center at the next level. Still, you figure he's a good bet for a starting role on the right team.

***best fits***

Boston (#26, #30) would be a dream fit for Jalen Smith if he fall that far. He can help protect the rim defensively without clogging the paint offensively. He'd have more of a limited role in Utah (#23), but he'd be a nice change of pace behind Rudy Gobert there.

***worst fits***

Given Philadelphia (#21)'s overcrowded frontcourt, it's hard to see a fit there (barring an Al Horford trade.)"
7570,2020-11-09 18:24:24,jqxyb4,"Some more prospects that didn't fit into the post limit --


**(18) PF/C Precious Achiuwa, Memphis**

Jalen Smith's ability to play either the PF or C position is typically seen as a positive. Other times, players get blasted if they're perceived as ""tweeners."" Some of that set in to the narrative to Precious Achiuwa when he came to Memphis. He had the skill set of an energy big, but he appeared to be a pure PF in terms of size.

In some ways, Achiuwa may have James Wiseman to blame for that. He looked smaller next to that big-ass dude, in the same way a teen girl may look slimmer when sidled next to her [DUFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DUFF). 

When Wiseman left school, Achiuwa stepped up and looked the part of an effective smallball center. He racked up 15.8 points and 10.8 rebounds per game, showcasing very good athleticism and energy. At 6'9"" with a 7'2"" wingspan, he should have enough size to man the paint in the modern NBA. If his skill set and shooting continues to improve, he can be a good PF as well, but at the moment he projects best as a high-end rotational player and potential starter on the right team.

***best fits***

Teams should be eyeing Precious Achiuwa as a backup at first, and utilize him as a complement to their current starter. He'd make sense in that backup role behind Jusuf Nurkic in Portland (#16) as well as Nurkic's former teammate Nikola Jokic in Denver (#22). Both of those team's current backups (Hassan Whiteside and Mason Plumlee) are free agents.

***worst fits***

Philadelphia (#21) has already invested a ton in big men Joel Embiid and Al Horford; Precious Achiuwa wouldn't make much sense there. His lack of shooting (at this stage) would also make him a potentially clunky fit in Milwaukee (#24), as they've made a point to surround Giannis Antetokounmpo with spacing."
7571,2020-11-09 18:25:13,jqxyb4,"Some more prospects that didn't fit into the post limit --

**(20) SF Robert Woodard II, Mississippi State** (HIGHER than most expert rankings)

We mentioned Devin Vassell as a template for 3+D wings who can fit on virtually any team in the league. Mississippi State's Robert Woodard may be a bargain brand version of the same type of player.

Like Vassell, Woodard is a sophomore whose stats don't jump off the page -- he only averaged 11.4 points in 33.1 minutes of action. Like Vassell, his three-point shooting probably won't match his last year in college (43%) given the red flags with his poor FT%. But like Vassell, there's enough clay here to work with regardless. His shooting should be good *enough*, and he has a great frame for a wing at 6'7"" and a 7'1"" wingspan. 

Woodard's strength may be his best virtue. He's 230 pounds, and utilized that well on defense and on the glass (where he averaged 6.5 boards per game.) All in all, he's a 3+D player who could theoretically slide out and be a stretch PF as well. That versatility should make him a nice addition to a team, with his real value being dependent on how consistent he can be from deep.

I'd also mark Louisville's **Jordan Nwora** as a 3+D player who's being underrated by draft rankings. Nwora isn't as strong on defense as Woodard, but his shooting is much more reliable. I'd be surprised if both are not long-time pros.

***best fits***

Robert Woodard and Jordan Nwora aren't locks for R1 right now, meaning they could be potential steals later on. They'd both make sense for the Lakers (#28), particularly if the team decides to move on from Kyle Kuzma. They'd also fit with the Knicks (#27) as low-usage players to complement R.J Barrett on the wing.

***worst fits***

I don't see a solid 3+D prospect as a bad fit anywhere, but a team like Oklahoma City (#25) may be looking for higher-upside players at this stage. Boston (#26, #30) is also loaded on the wing, unless they end up losing Gordon Hayward in free agency."

7576,2020-11-09 20:23:14,jqxyb4,">His experience as a pro should help toward that end, as he's used to working hard and fitting in on a team of vets

Another thing worth pointing out about Avdija is the amount of NBA experience he played with. His teammates last year at Maccabi played a total of almost 2300 NBA games between them. That's gotta help getting yourself prepared and mentally ready for the NBA (especially with the shortened off-season and training camp)

For anyone curious, his teammates with NBA experience last season: Amar'e Stoudemire, Quincy Acy, Omri Casspi, Tarik Black, Tyler Dorsey, Nate Wolters and Othello Hunter. Also played with Johnny O'Bryant and Jeremy Pargo the year before

Great write-up sir."
7594,2020-11-10 00:35:07,jqxyb4,"I think everyone is sleeping big on Theo Maledon. He's put up the best EuroLeague stats of any non-Doncic 18 year old in the past decade, is a savant in the PnR, and has a very clean shot (~36% from 3 ~83% from the line depending on which competitions you look at). 

Prior to a small shoulder injury he was seen as a better prospect than Hayes and the people I've talked to who follow French basketball have said they prefer Maledon. At this point I'm honestly confused why he hasn't gotten more draft hype. At the very least he should be rated similarly to Deni because he was clearly a better player in EuroLeague.

I think whoever drafts him is getting a good NBA player. I hope it's the nuggets."
7595,2020-11-09 20:31:36,jqxyb4,onyeka has that same outlet pass ability the ball brothers brought as well.
7596,2020-11-09 22:04:49,jqxyb4,No love for T maxey anywhere! Boys gonna be dropping 25 a night with highlights daily
7597,2020-11-09 23:41:47,jqxyb4,"Eh I don't really see Toppin as being a good fit with Washington, mostly because of the fact that they have another player (Rui) whose skill set I feel overlaps a bit too much with Toppin, but I think your take on him is relatively fair."
7598,2020-11-09 23:42:40,jqxyb4,I mentione it earlier this year but ill say it again. Killian is sleeper. He will be by far the best of this draft class
7599,2020-11-10 00:37:29,jqxyb4,"O wise draft oracle, bless us with your favorite second round prospects."
7600,2020-11-10 00:58:37,jqxyb4,"Awesome post, will be fun to look back in 4 years.

This feels like one of the worst drafts in NBA history. I'm sure someone will come out good but there's absolutely no can't-miss talent anywhere"
7601,2020-11-10 01:22:08,jqxyb4,"> (15) PF Aleksej Pokusevski, **Serbia**

If he falls to 22, oh boy..."
7602,2020-11-10 02:03:58,jqxyb4,"Mate you have the countries mixed up for Lamelo and RJ. Lamelo played for Illawarra, in Australia, and RJ played for the NZ breakers. Both teams are in the Australian comp, the NBL"
7603,2020-11-10 02:40:29,jqxyb4,"Seriously, the best draft write up I've read this year. Can you do the whole first round?"
7604,2020-11-10 05:07:06,jqxyb4,"This is way better than my overly short and probably correct hot take: ""Yeah, at least one of these guys will end up being good"""
7605,2020-11-10 06:19:02,jqxyb4,"I like Josh Green. Quick release, nice stroke, athletic, big wingspan, and although they don't always translate he plays good D and moves well within the offense. I don't understand why he's not rated higher in this draft.

Admittedly I haven't watched much cbb this year. But it's insane to me that all these Sophmores are suddenly in the lottery who have the same flaws as last year. And the first round has some SG/SF with totally busted shots akin to Lonzo."
7606,2020-11-10 14:53:41,jqxyb4,Oh yeah centers really have to scrape and crawl like ayton and bagley
7607,2020-11-09 20:15:09,jqxyb4,"I'm glad that you found this fun.  But as someone who watches the ""experts"" be wrong most of the time, I would rather burn myself with lit cigarettes than give myself this much homework for something that's almost certainly wrong lol not that you don't know what you're talking about, it's just that nobody does lol"
7608,2020-11-09 19:43:33,jqxyb4,Good god that draft class is atrocious
7609,2020-11-09 16:10:08,jqxyb4,Minnesota should really consider moving back to 4 or 5 if they can.
7610,2020-11-09 15:26:27,jqxyb4,Thanks buddy. And sorry about the whole white hetero guy thing. Not a very trendy combo these days.
7611,2020-11-09 15:45:58,jqxyb4,"Really? Reddit seems extremely low on him. I didn't see a lot of draft talk here, but both r/clevelandcavs and r/nba_draft are very cold on Obi. The consensus on our sub is to draft Okoro over him, meanwhile the more mainstream mocks have him around #5."
7612,2020-11-09 15:26:01,jqxyb4,Maybe too pessimistic who knows. But I figure if Okongwu stuck around college for 3 more years he’d be pretty dominant too.
7613,2020-11-09 16:23:32,jqxyb4,"I’m with y’all, I don’t see him being super effective in the league. He’s already 22, I think a lot of his success came from physical development that 17 year olds didn’t have"
7614,2020-11-09 20:46:20,jqxyb4,If he learns how to shoot yup. 56% FT is scary
7615,2020-11-09 18:05:25,jqxyb4,Duly noted!
7616,2020-11-09 20:05:27,jqxyb4,"> Deni Avidja is the best prospect in this draft

for me is Okongwu

let's see!

!RemindMe 3 years"
7617,2020-11-09 21:31:29,jqxyb4,Yes please damn
7618,2020-11-10 03:05:57,jqxyb4,Good thing you said it here too because no one listens to your podcast
7619,2020-11-09 15:28:42,jqxyb4,Yeah I think Poku may be better served playing as a stretch PF due to those strength concerns. It won’t happen in the NbA but I could see a scenario where he’d be like a Kevin Durant if he stayed in Europe forever.
7620,2020-11-09 21:30:13,jqxyb4,"I think people need to think of Poku as a 3 who happens to be 7 ft. He has shown the ability to play good perimeter defense, and has the potential to become good enough at shooting and passing to justify being a wing. He will never be a guy who bangs down low or tears up the glass, but if he can develop his skillset further, then I dont think his lack of strength will end up mattering that much."
7621,2020-11-09 15:35:12,jqxyb4,Those are all great points. Your difficult 3PA emphasis is spot on too. Basketball-reference lists by shot distribution and guys shooting corner threes tend to be like 5-10% higher. Statistically we tend to punish guys who let their teammates take those easier shots.
7622,2020-11-09 20:53:26,jqxyb4,Also did people really forget the video where Vassell is literally shooting like a trebuchet now Carlos Boozer style
7623,2020-11-09 17:29:45,jqxyb4,"I feel like Vassell might end up being more than 3&D.  Think he could be a good mid range shooter with his high release and touch and could be a solid decision maker.  Even though his handles are boring, I think he might end up being a guy that can score in mid range and make some smart passes.  But that does depend on him earning a role to do more than just spot-up.

Not saying he will be a star scorer, but I think, while he may not be some super stud three point shooter or slasher, he could be a good enough decision maker and smart enough player that he just brings enough value with his overall game to be better than they specialists."
7624,2020-11-09 22:34:55,jqxyb4,"I hope Miami takes a gander at Smith. I really like his game and it seems a lot of people on the Heat sub do too. A lot of mocks have us taking a guard as a possible replacement for Dragic but none of us think Dragic is going anywhere any time soon. There's also been reports of Smith meeting with the team so there may be some traction there.

I suppose it'll all come down to how much he fits the work rate and mindset of the team like the rest of the young guys do. In a perfect world, he slides right into our starting or backup 4 spot and provides the same shooting Jae Crowder did while supplementing Bam's defense down low."
7625,2020-11-09 23:11:50,jqxyb4,I think Toronto would be a good landing spot for Jalen Smith especially if Ibaka leaves.
7626,2020-11-09 20:14:21,jqxyb4,Too late. NBA GMs draft exclusively based on reddit.
7627,2020-11-09 20:37:20,jqxyb4,"Not gonna lie, I sort of hope we take him with the knowledge that we likely lose Drummond this season."
7628,2020-11-10 00:44:32,jqxyb4,Sad Wolves noises :(
7629,2020-11-09 16:44:35,jqxyb4,Patrick was just outside the top 15. I’m on a phone now but I’ll post 16-20 later here.
7630,2020-11-09 16:46:47,jqxyb4,"""Superstar in the making"" is a pretty huge exaggeration"
7631,2020-11-09 16:11:20,jqxyb4,I live Coby but there is no way you determine who you should draft with a top 5 based off half a season of Coby white
7632,2020-11-09 16:25:54,jqxyb4,"i don’t see why they can’t work together, lamelo has the size to guard opposing 2s while filling in coby’s lack of playmaking"
7633,2020-11-09 15:27:31,jqxyb4,You’re right I should have factored in Coby White more there. I view him more as a Lou Williams type scorer but either way you probably don’t need to invest so much in scoring guards.
7634,2020-11-09 16:46:48,jqxyb4,"We are absolutely not good at PG. 

We have two scoring guards and no pass first players with high level playmaking ability. 

It doesn't have to be a PG, but Coby isn't a reason to pass on a gifted passer."
7635,2020-11-09 19:58:39,jqxyb4,"Coby is more of a SG on offense. Bulls need to address PG, whether it’s through this pick or not"
7636,2020-11-09 18:18:07,jqxyb4,Wildly inaccurate Coby White assessment
7637,2020-11-09 16:14:27,jqxyb4,He would be a good fit in Charlotte for sure but everything I’ve heard in the past like month has been that they really want Wiseman. If I was a betting man I’d say they try to swing a trade to move up to 1 or 2 for him
7638,2020-11-09 14:35:49,jqxyb4,"My first instinct is yes, although I do think the problem is mostly top end. There’s decent depth  to me it’s just that this top 3 should probably be 3-4-5 picks in a normal year."
7639,2020-11-09 15:58:26,jqxyb4,"I don’t think he meant that they’re necessarily bad fits, they’re just redundant players for the Suns more so than any other team"
7640,2020-11-09 16:10:53,jqxyb4,That’s funny I didn’t even notice that. I think their best scenario would be to get a guy like Haliburton who can eventually start alongside Booker.
7641,2020-11-09 15:29:43,jqxyb4,Especially if you’re eyeing a veteran PG. not sure I love the CP3 rumors but he’d be helpful to those young players.
7642,2020-11-09 17:52:33,jqxyb4,All risky to various degrees. Part of my assessment there is based on personality which I admit I’d be unqualified to do given my limited access.
7643,2020-11-09 14:26:58,jqxyb4,It’s possible. He really shot the lights out as a sophomore (and not as much as a freshman) so that’s a concern.
7644,2020-11-09 15:12:27,jqxyb4,"He didn't even touch on what I think is Nesmith's most valuable skill and that's the way he moves off ball around screens and positioning himself for passes from driving guards. I think in a draft like this with so many question marks, he has a clear path to being a valuable player."
7645,2020-11-09 20:15:20,jqxyb4,I'm sure they have upside -- I just have a bias against that type of player who are scoring guards. They seem easier to find than other positions.
7646,2020-11-09 18:12:59,jqxyb4,I can see that or a trade as most likely.
7647,2020-11-09 23:37:09,jqxyb4,"I think so to. Our only centers our Chriss and Looney. While both have been good young players, they are both small ball centers, and with Looney's injury concern they need another center who isn't undersized. That being said, a big traditional center to play 15 minutes a game to get beat up by Embiid and Jokic shouldn't be too expensive.


If not that, they really need a wing player that can shoot."
7648,2020-11-10 01:40:39,jqxyb4,He does have a cool name
7649,2020-11-09 14:26:36,jqxyb4,Thanks Solo!
7650,2020-11-09 15:25:19,jqxyb4,"20%. Can’t deny that. But Hezonja was the type of Euro that raised more red flags. Allegedly won with athleticism over there, and allegedly had a diva attitude."
7651,2020-11-10 12:41:30,jqxyb4,"Well.

Is there chance that Deni ends up a bust? Yes. As with any other draft prospect which is not someone like Luka (MVP of 2nd best league in the world) or maybe Zion.

Specifically for same reasons as Hezonija? No. They aren't similar at all as players or personalities, and were in different situations before draft. Basically nothing in common except being white Europeans of similar size."
7652,2020-11-09 17:51:33,jqxyb4,"Thanks for reading, your royalty."
7653,2020-11-09 20:15:36,jqxyb4,I haven't actually seen it yet but I'm looking forward to it.
7654,2020-11-09 20:50:26,jqxyb4,For real?
7655,2020-11-10 03:03:38,jqxyb4,RJ's shooting motion wasn't bad that I saw. Maybe some inconsistent feet but it feels like the percentages should've been better. Weird stuff.
7656,2020-11-10 05:01:57,jqxyb4,"Elle Woods is Jeremy Lin. 

Great resume and ends up at Harvard where they overachieve but STILL get no respect. Finally overcome stereotypes and get their shot, take it, and succeed.

Yet OPs still can't get it right.

But seriously, underrated movie. And hope Jeremy Lin gets another shot this upcoming season."
7657,2020-11-09 23:19:28,jqxyb4,"Very good point, Boobygirls."
7658,2020-11-10 16:54:42,jqxyb4,Thanks buddy !
7659,2020-11-10 16:54:08,jqxyb4,Yeah I always had mocked Maledon to Phoenix as a potential defensive minded guard but he doesn’t even seem to be in that range anymore.
7660,2020-11-10 16:54:28,jqxyb4,True. If that was to work you’d have to play Toppin at the 5 and then your defense is even worse.
7661,2020-11-10 16:53:42,jqxyb4,You’re not alone in that - maybe I’m missing something there.
7662,2020-11-10 16:53:28,jqxyb4,Hmm I like Bolmaro from Argentina... maybe Vernon Carey the center from Duke as a bench scorer... will try to think of more.
7663,2020-11-10 02:06:18,jqxyb4,Damn sorry ! Corrected now.
7664,2020-11-10 16:52:20,jqxyb4,Thanks Omer lover ! I don’t think people would be as keen about picks 20-30 so I probably won’t but I’ll consider it.
7665,2020-11-10 16:52:52,jqxyb4,Agree about Josh Green. He was a top recruit too so it’s not like he’s been under the radar.
7666,2020-11-10 15:01:08,jqxyb4,That’s true but those guys averaged 20-12 (Ayton) and 21-11 (Bagley) as college freshmen. That’s pretty rare.
7667,2020-11-09 16:00:41,jqxyb4,"lol yeah, it's been interesting seeing how that plays into arguments against points i make"
7668,2020-11-10 00:19:57,jqxyb4,"A community mock draft worked its way around the team subreddits a couple weeks ago and Obi dropped all the way to 13.

Obi is a good basketball player but not a good player for the Modern NBA. I think OP is right with his Derrick Williams comparison, but I could also see the argument for Anthony Bennett as a comparison- Bennett and Obi put up good, *very* similar stats at small schools and shot the 3 decently well on a small sample. Both have serious questions on defense as well."
7669,2020-11-10 02:18:27,jqxyb4,i got cole anthony as a sleeper best player in the draft!!! !remindme 3 years
7670,2020-11-10 03:40:44,jqxyb4,It's true....as of right now.
7671,2020-11-09 17:17:12,jqxyb4,"I keep looking at him as a kevin durant ESQUE guy. he's got the fluidity in his jumper that guys his size just don't have. the problem is it doesn't go in quite as much as you'd like. I love his playstyle though, and he's easily the guy I'm highest on."
7672,2020-11-09 21:46:33,jqxyb4,"I totally missed that when it came out, [but I found it and...ughhhh](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2020-nba-draft-workout-video-shows-alarming-change-in-devin-vassells-shooting-form/)"
7673,2020-11-09 16:41:02,jqxyb4,That would be my ideal pick as well but I have my doubts he slides to 10. All this uncertainty will lead to a very interesting draft that's for sure.
7674,2020-11-09 14:58:36,jqxyb4,He also played against lesser competition
7675,2020-11-09 16:11:37,jqxyb4,He can’t do anything else like at all
7676,2020-11-09 17:41:21,jqxyb4,"I think he might be a good-to-great role player, but he should be in the 10-20 range, not 5-10"
7677,2020-11-09 21:39:31,jqxyb4,"agree with your evaluation. I'm honestly getting more intrigued with Tyler Terry every day that pass, I guess that's common with the ""riser"" in a draft but I really liked both his recent films and the interview he made."
7678,2020-11-09 18:20:16,jqxyb4,I don’t even think the warriors are gonna trade that pick. They have a perfect chance to get the guy that they shape their future on for the next 10-20 years.
7679,2020-11-10 03:14:03,jqxyb4,Miller said they were really working on consistency with his footwork and release.
7680,2020-11-10 16:57:55,jqxyb4,"Phoenix draft Cam Johnson at 11 when he was projected at 25-30, so they definitely could still take Maledon. I'm just mystified as to why a great prospect with few weaknesses compared to the other top PGs has dropped in all the published mock drafts."
7681,2020-11-10 15:08:37,jqxyb4,I know u are right but its funny usually centers arent picked that high and when they are the teams regret it
7682,2020-11-10 04:29:40,jqxyb4,Don’t waste your time
7683,2020-11-09 14:58:51,jqxyb4,And has a somewhat slow release
7684,2020-11-09 16:45:16,jqxyb4,"That’s OK with me though. Know your role, do your job, whatever other sports cliches there are."
7685,2020-11-09 22:08:55,jqxyb4,"Yeah he's apparently very smart, which I figure teams should be factoring in more often these days."
7686,2020-11-10 08:04:44,jqxyb4,This is not the draft to do that.
7687,2020-11-10 04:36:03,jqxyb4,It's fun tho and I get to spend time with my friend rather than play video games or browse reddit.
7688,2020-11-09 17:30:57,jqxyb4,"His release is my concern.  I am not sure pure spot up shooters are all that valuable, so he kinda has to run off screens or learn how to create off the dribble.  But his release might be too slow for him to be like Korver or Redick coming off screens.  I think he can move off the ball, the concern is just that his release is too slow for him to be a deadly shooter off screens against NBA defenders."

7695,2020-11-09 14:05:31,jqxkzi,"My pick for the division winner was the NYG.  They play the Eagles this coming week, I think that is going to determine who's going to win the division.  If the Giants win, we're at worst 1.5 games back and still possible for us.  We might seriously be looking at a 5 win team making the playoffs in the NFCE."
7696,2020-11-09 14:06:36,jqxkzi,"They have to win more games to even have a shot and losing Allen doesn't help.

- Taylor and Coles are interchangeable depending on how much you want to set a mongrel tone early.

- S. Barrett and Tuipulotu are probably interchangeable but I've gone for Barrett who has more test caps and more big game experience. 

- Ioane can go to the bench for Sotutu who goes to 8 if you'd prefer, but I prefer this way because Sotutu can come on and be a big bastard carrying off the back of scrums against tired flankers.

- Personally I think Whitelock is a better captain, but if the All Blacks use a leadership group like they have in the past then captain is basically just down to who you think is the best communicator with the ref."

Dude is unproven at this level and there's plenty of banging super players who failed to make the top level. Fwiw, I think he will but nothing's been proven...yet."
7768,2020-11-10 21:58:29,jqsotn,Only reason i put Asafo in the starting pack was because I feel like he could add a lot to the pack and by the time of the next world cup could possibly be new zealands version of tupou . Plus Codie Taylor is kinda average now and coles will simply be too old .
7769,2020-11-09 10:09:08,jqsotn,"Did Will actually even play 10 minutes? he got concussed almost immediately after stepping on the pitch and was off within a couple of minutes, wasn't he?

I'm as big a Will Jordan fan as anyone (I mean, look at the flair, I clearly have an eyepatch) but I agree that it's crazy how fast he's being pushed as a candidate at 14. He's really bloody great, and I think will get the jersey in time, but it reeks of new toy syndrome to me when people start him.

7783,2020-11-09 12:19:38,jqsc0g,"Honestly even when we brought pressure it didn’t get home. The first play of the game on defense Dean had a kill shot on brees and instead bit on a pump fake and went sailing by, that kinda set the tone for the game. Same drive it looked like quarters or cover 3 where Dean is responsible for a deep quarter or deep third and he BITES ON A FUCKING STOP ROUTE.

Same issue last week and I was assured that this was by design of Todd Bowles defense, well if it’s by design we need a new DC and if it’s not Dean has to be sat down for a game or 2 until he learns to read his keys and do his job."
7784,2020-11-09 15:40:01,jqsc0g,I think even worse than the soft zone gameplan was the decision by the coaching staff to not change or make adjustments
7785,2020-11-09 08:44:14,jqsc0g,"When teams are searching for new HC next year and Bowels gets his ""We have to interview a black guy"" calls, this game will be used as Exhibit A as to why he won't get a HC gig"

7787,2020-11-09 17:02:47,jqsc0g,I think the bucs need to bring in earl thomas. Dean has had a good season but teams just tend to pick on him Thomas has experience in the safety and would help them out a lot.

What if, this is all a 4D chess move to keep New Orleans from seeing the Man Press Zone Blitz scheme first hand.  Expecting that we would likely have to go through them in the playoffs at some point.

Now, I am not advocating that is precisely what is going on right now...but I am just saying there is a possibility that they are planning for this eventuality.

7797,2020-11-09 17:06:17,jqsc0g,"A random blitz here and there was/is completely useless. It was when we were bringing the house every other snap from different positions that we had a real impact. Bowles changed for some reason and he was wrong.

7804,2020-11-10 17:52:58,jqsc0g,"Agreed. Yet this while sub was aflame about running on 1st every series.  Once you're down 14 or more against Brees team, throwing with Brady and all those weapons honestly needs to be the best option.  Shorter passes and better line play would have gone much further. But putting them in 3rd and long over and over likely wouldn't have changed the outcome. It was just that bad a game. If they ran 50 percent of the time we'd be blasting them for not putting it in ""playmakers"" hands"

7806,2020-11-09 06:32:06,jqsc0g,"Davis has been a lock down corner this year 

And Lavonte is one of the best coverage LBs of his generation."
7807,2020-11-09 06:20:29,jqsc0g,"Davis is great. Dean is talented but I don’t think he’s very intelligent. Sean Murphy-Bunting is Vernon Hargreaves 2.0. He was been the weak link of the defense this year along with Devin White (at least in pass defense).

We have got to be more aggressive and bring pressure or our defense will get massacred"
7808,2020-11-09 06:20:17,jqsc0g,The LB's 100% can't cover. It's the biggest ongoing issue. It's been the same story for years and it's why the slants and tight ends keep killing us.
7809,2020-11-09 07:06:52,jqsc0g,"Ya no rushing, the blitzing wasn't there. Oline couldn't stop their front 4 at all and Brady looked confused and in a panic."
7810,2020-11-09 12:10:51,jqsc0g,Wait a second... Last night we may have been conservative on defense but boles defense is predicated on risk taking and hes done so much of the year.
7811,2020-11-09 20:28:52,jqsc0g,"Yep, makes sense that you’d fire an offense oriented coach for poor defensive play. Logic checks out."

7813,2020-11-09 13:35:01,jqsc0g,Wouldn’t want him either tbh.
7814,2020-11-11 01:45:05,jqsc0g,I feel like when we were down 21 nothing at the beginning of the 2nd quarter all the saints had to play against was our pass game. We should’ve ran way more and tried to develop rhythm that we needed. Fournette and RoJo can rip off long runs.
7815,2020-11-09 14:19:39,jqsc0g,Lol well David has given up 3 TD in the last 3 games so I guess now
7816,2020-11-09 07:49:37,jqsc0g,"There is no Hargreaves 2.0. Vern is in a class by himself. SMB has had some struggles, same with Dean. But there's enough good tape to be encouraged going forward. If anything, let's hope this game is a reminder to trash every philosophy we used last year."
7817,2020-11-09 17:26:41,jqsc0g,"Even if our LBs aren't great in coverage, our defense in general looks dominant when we DON'T play soft zone. So even if we get toasted for a few plays a game due to our LBs in coverage, it's better than giving up 31 points in a half"

7819,2020-11-09 13:35:54,jqsc0g,Then you don’t want another ring.
7820,2020-11-09 20:07:37,jqsc0g,If you think Beli would be underperforming with all this talent i got a bridge to sell you lol. Youd prob have 1 loss right now and thats week 1.
7821,2020-11-09 17:21:19,jqsc0g,"He's giving up TDs because the scheme puts him out of position at the start of every play. He's trying to cover the A gap in the run game and then is expected to drop into a zone in front of the deep in/curl (10-15 yards off the ball) because our corners are playing so soft. 

Or he's lined up in the middle of the field with A gap responsibility in the run game but has to cover a RB man to man out of the backfield on a swing route. 

The defensive scheme is outdated and with a QB like Brees, they're going to immediately take advantage of free yardage whenever they can. How many passes were caught in front of our cornerbacks and safeties, completely uncontested last night? I think the Saints got somewhere around 50% of their yards on the same routes."
7822,2020-11-09 08:21:32,jqsc0g,Dean and SMB look stiff as fuck out there. That being said not sure what Bowles thought... Gameplan on both sides of the ball stunk.
7823,2020-11-09 23:44:15,jqsc0g,"Yea, and the games we had played conservative on defense, we got torched. It makes no sense not to use what has worked in all but 1 game"
7824,2020-11-09 14:46:03,jqsc0g,I do
7825,2020-11-10 02:30:10,jqsc0g,True
7826,2020-11-10 17:57:24,jqsc0g,"Very we stayed.  Same shit against Giants. Mentioned to the fiance that the winning game plan should be run to sticks in the zone and turn and wait for free 10 yards.  DBacks are just playing too far off to make plays on the ball. A good team exploited the shit out of it. If I can see it, how can a defensive coordinator not have or not made adjustments. Can't play every team the same in this league. Personnel groupings have to adjust else it's just poor game planning."
7827,2020-11-09 14:47:05,jqsc0g,Bill could definitely get another ring with this team
7828,2020-11-10 18:36:22,jqsc0g,"What doesn’t make any sense to me is we made the adjustment against Green Bay. Played 2 drives in soft zone and got lit up, gave up 10 points essentially for free. Then we started blitzing and taking away easy throws and Green Bay had absolutely no answers 

When I watch all good defenses nowadays, the strategy appears to be constant pressure on the QB and taking away high percentage throws. We need to force guys like drew Brees to beat us on really tough sideline and deep throws, just like they did to Brady"
7829,2020-11-09 15:06:17,jqsc0g,I agree
7830,2020-11-10 18:52:43,jqsc0g,Agreed
7831,2020-11-09 12:23:26,jqs23n,"I agree with you. Here are some of my fav alternates which hardly get mention: Opal, Kanzi, SnapDragon, Sugar Bee, Envy, Crispin/Mutsu, Zestar."
7832,2020-11-09 16:14:42,jqs23n,"I have a notebook where I write down my thoughts about every apple I try. I'm up to about 135 varieties and Red Delicious is definitely the worst of all of them. Just awful.

But apparently it was originally pretty good, when it was called the Delicious. Over time, orchardists selected sports that were redder and more oblong and the taste suffered."
7833,2020-11-09 15:51:38,jqs23n,I agree - they are sweet sawdust.
7834,2020-11-09 17:07:13,jqs23n,"Back in March, at the beginning of COVID era, the grocery store near me had only Red Delicious apples at one point. I bought them and ate them but it begs the question - is no apple better than any Red Delicious apple?"
7835,2020-11-09 17:55:33,jqs23n,Red delicious are apples for horses.
7836,2020-11-09 16:00:21,jqs23n,couldn't agree more
7837,2021-04-15 06:46:02,jqs23n,"Red Delicious apples are pretty, but unfit for human consumption. Sort of like poison dart frogs."
7838,2020-11-11 03:18:36,jqs23n,Kanzi crew rise up!
7839,2020-11-19 08:09:45,jqs23n,"I just found some SnapDragons at a local store. They are pretty good!  Not as sweet as honeycrisp but that can be good. They are fresh tasting--even McIntosh apples are crisp when they are just picked, but these remind me most of fresh McIntosh."
7840,2020-11-19 08:08:36,jqs23n,"That is my guess too, which is sad."
7841,2020-11-19 08:08:02,jqs23n,Crab apples. Though crab apples are good for jelly!
7842,2020-11-09 09:27:35,jqs0a8,"What’s sad is that the first bad free agent signing that popped into my head was Toby Gerhart, and he’s not even on the list

That’s how bad Caldwell has been in free agency outside of 2016-17"
7843,2020-11-09 06:22:24,jqs0a8,"Dude over here writing a fucking novel. I can do a 

TDLR: we fucking suck."
7844,2020-11-09 06:28:26,jqs0a8,What. This is new information!
7845,2020-11-09 07:58:54,jqs0a8,I like the davon Hamilton pick more then the smoothie king but we always knew Ben would take a few years before he is nfl level
7846,2020-11-09 11:28:04,jqs0a8,Caldwell will somehow survive this season. Why else would he trade every player that has value away unless he knows he's coming back? His actions don't match a guy that's on the hot seat imo
7847,2020-11-09 10:29:12,jqs0a8,Not gonna read all that. But Caldwell should definitely be fired. And then the new GM hires a new coaching staff.
7848,2020-11-09 15:11:04,jqs0a8,"Coughlin picked Fournette. Rumors that Coughlin forbid drafting a QB since he had gaga eyes for Foles. Leading Dave to make a ""fun"" pick with their high draft spot. Coughlin refuses to negotiate with a 4th rounder not in a contract year and refuses to re-sign your lock-down corner over ""character issues."" 

Without Coughlin, maybe we get Jamal Adams, Dalvin Cook, Lamar Jackson, keep Yannick and Jalen? Who knows!!

Either way, Dave couldn't dig himself out of Tom's mess and is now trying to take care of his guys by finding them new teams while setting the next GM up for a fun rebuild."
7849,2020-11-09 13:20:33,jqs0a8,"Still better than Gene Smith, but time to move on!"
7850,2020-11-09 16:26:07,jqs0a8,"I think we need more clarifications on how much influence Coughlin had on some of this. And I can’t blame much of that first year on Caldwell. Garbage draft year and not much available on FA.

The other problem is who are we replacing him with? There are going to be some much more enticing GM destinations like ATL and the Giants."
7851,2020-11-09 20:21:11,jqs0a8,"I am on board with cleaning house.    

I do think some of this is hindsight, though. I can't disagree with the 'process' that lead to signing Gus. Gus Bradley was a very highly regarded coaching candidate and no one can really predict whether great coordinator will translate into great HC (Buddy Ryan, Rod Marinelli, Romeo Crennel, Gus Bradley, Hue Jackson, Dick LeBeau Josh McDaniels, etc etc, the list can go on for a long while). But, some coordinators definitely become great HCs, like Belichick, and Carroll, so you have to take your chances sometimes.    

The real issue with Gus was sticking with him about 2 years past the point where it was obvious he wasn't going to cut it.    

I get that you want to create the image of your team as a place where an HC can come and will get a fair shake rather than firing a coach every other year since the latter may cause quality HC candidates to balk at signing thinking they may be dealing with a trigger happy owner. This is especially true of a small market team like the Jaguars where high quality coaching candidates are already on the fence because of our long history of sucking. But, I think that should have only given Gus maybe 1 of the extra 2 years he got after it was obvious it wasn't working.  

I also think a lot of the contract issues were decisions that Caldwell made in conjunction with coaches like Marrone/Bradley. Things like signing Chris Ivory/Gerhart and drafting TJ Yeldon in the 2nd, so that Gus Bradley could instill his run first offense come to mind. I don't put those on Caldwell.  

I could write a whole novel making excuses for Caldwell, but I am still about 70/30 wanting him gone. He had his chance and his partnership with Gus/Marrone/TC did not produce great results except for that one brilliant year. I don't think Caldwell deserves the opportunity to rebuild for us."
7852,2020-11-09 22:26:31,jqs0a8,"Honestly with us sucking your dick these are the kind of post we need. Thanks for the good read while I’m pooping

Edit: sucking a dick*"
7853,2020-11-09 13:44:28,jqs0a8,Alot of words to state the obvious
7854,2020-11-09 15:18:47,jqs0a8,"Fire everyone is a commitment to 2-4 more years of absolute suck, and that’s assuming the rebuild works the first time and we don’t need to blow it up again for another 2-4 years. The fire everyone at once mentality is motivated more by a desire for justice. A smooth transition where we stagger the firings is more likely to make our 2021 hoard of draft picks useful before their rookie contracts are up."
7855,2020-11-12 05:20:36,jqs0a8,One can only hope
7856,2020-11-09 12:51:09,jqs0a8,This headline is the Webster’s definition of “duhh.”
7857,2020-11-09 13:12:01,jqs0a8,"Yeah there was a few I could’ve added, the free agent write up is primarily opinionated"
7858,2020-11-09 14:02:55,jqs0a8,"Ahh, Slowby Gerhart."
7859,2020-11-09 06:26:59,jqs0a8,"My frustrations were building, so I decided to write **a lot** in hopes that maybe Caldwell will actually be gone after this season"
7860,2020-11-09 19:16:20,jqs0a8,To don’t long read
7861,2020-11-09 09:29:41,jqs0a8,Our run defense has been noticeably better since Hamilton started getting reps
7862,2020-11-09 12:10:56,jqs0a8,Absolutely agree.
7863,2020-11-09 13:13:48,jqs0a8,"That’s what I’m afraid of, they are too committed to him. He’s done just enough to retain his job while not really doing anything of actual substance or value during his tenure. The Foles and Ramsey trades probably wind up being job savers for him based on the draft capital we acquired."
7864,2020-11-09 20:17:04,jqs0a8,I've shit things more competent than Gene Smith. Not a tough bar to clear.
7865,2020-11-09 21:35:41,jqs0a8,"The draft when we took Joke also came after Caldwell was barely in the building, so he was using Gene Smith's scouting/etc. 

Joke was also a consensus top 5 pick, so its not like it was picking Tyson Alualu in the first."
7866,2020-11-09 23:29:30,jqs0a8,Now instead of watching the Jags be abysmal you can read about it too :)
7867,2020-11-09 13:14:56,jqs0a8,"Yup, I know the sentiment is common among Jags fans, so instead of just reiterating that statement I wanted to reiterate it with a little substance to back it up"
7868,2020-11-09 14:53:25,jqs0a8,Albino Rino
7869,2020-11-09 09:57:36,jqs0a8,No chance. I genuinely dont expect anyone to get fired because jags
7870,2020-11-09 17:04:10,jqs0a8,I agree we need to draft cb and safety our secondary is the worst tin the league
7871,2020-11-09 13:20:22,jqs0a8,"This was one helluva essay.  Here’s the deal:  Caldwell’s first rebuild should have been considered a failure due to the Bortles pick but the fluke season of 2017 playing a last place schedule and the AFCS QB’s all dropped like flies gave the franchise false hope.  They took a helluva shot and damn near made the Super Bowl.  Not sure how Khan could trust Caldwell to try another rebuild.

This team can pull a turnaround similar to what the Dolphins are doing with a good coach and a franchise QB."
7872,2020-11-09 13:33:14,jqs0a8,You’re absolutely right. 2017 and some of the trades and picks he has done have been just enough to retain his job. Idk what Khan’s infatuation with him is. He has been an utter failure. Even ignoring the teams win/loss with him as GM he hasn’t been successful with the tasks expected of him as GM.
7873,2020-11-09 13:55:35,jqs0a8,Khan clearly knows a lot about used auto parts and not much about football....
7874,2020-11-09 05:24:19,jqrl62,*Sigh* You look for the fresh prints.
7875,2020-11-09 05:36:08,jqrjxg,We likely won’t get Sewell but we’re definitely primed to get some OL help in the draft.
7876,2020-11-09 05:54:44,jqrjxg,"If we end up with a top-10, top-5 pick like we’re on pace to...

We should trade back for two 1st round picks, go OT, DE, then CB with our early 2nd round pick

IOL with our 3rd"
7877,2020-11-09 14:11:41,jqrjxg,"Ideally trade back or Draft a Corner, DE or OL"
7878,2020-11-09 19:15:07,jqrjxg,Love my boy Andre Cisco. Glad he’s getting looks
7879,2020-11-09 05:38:23,jqrjxg,"Considering how we are playing, it is possible or we could trade up as well."
7880,2020-11-09 07:18:37,jqrjxg,Extreme long-shot what would be a perfect pick given his quality of play and connection with herbert given previous time in Oregon
7881,2020-11-09 08:50:14,jqrjxg,"I actually didn’t know til yesterday, but Sewell is sitting out this entire year to prepare for the draft. Does this affect his draft stock in any way?"
7882,2020-11-09 05:57:26,jqrjxg,This is what I was exatly thinking if both Penei Sewell and Ja'marr Chase are off the board.
7883,2020-11-09 06:14:42,jqrjxg,If they trade back then presumably they'd still just have 1 first round pick in 2021. Any first rounder netted would be in 2022.
7884,2020-11-10 07:20:59,jqrjxg,"I really like this safety class but Cisco is a bad man along with Paris Ford, Jevon Holland and Hamsah Nasirildeen."
7885,2020-11-09 05:47:27,jqrjxg,The Giants will take him if he’s there. I don’t see us picking after him but maybe.
7886,2020-11-09 14:12:32,jqrjxg,Let's just hope so
7887,2020-11-09 14:42:40,jqrjxg,"Probably not, he's put enough on tape that teams will still want him as the first lineman. It's also a year less wear and tear on his body, and he'll only be 20 when the 2021 season starts."
7888,2020-11-09 06:33:57,jqrjxg,"Hmm... you’re right. The jets and jags will likely be picking in front of us, dolphins would be only team that’d work for two 2021 picks... 

even then if Houston keeps sucking their other pick would be too close to ours for it to work. 

We could trade back into the 1st like the Kenneth Murray pick, then get a FA CB

But we gotta find starters at OT, DE and CB"
7889,2020-11-09 05:48:55,jqrjxg,One can only dream right?
7890,2020-11-09 23:56:17,jqrjxg,"If they're picking that high, they have to seriously consider replacing Danny Dimes. They also JUST took an OT with a high pick."
7891,2020-11-09 05:53:05,jqrjxg,I have been
7892,2020-11-10 03:05:33,jqrjxg,You could be right about that. The cardinals move was pretty unprecedented with Kyler but it could happen again. The Giants don’t have the option of taking the top name this time though thanks to the Jets.
7893,2020-11-10 07:18:48,jqrjxg,It's either qb or they give Jones one more year and take Ja'Marr Chase in my opinion.
7894,2020-11-10 08:44:34,jqrjxg,I think it's either QB or trade down. They have so many needs.
7895,2020-11-09 15:11:14,jqrg2o,"As a side note, Jorym was another character of mine from about a year ago. He died to protect the party from some kind of entity that we got trapped by. He tricked the entity into taking only his life (The entity seemed very confused, like it was multiple entities arguing amongst themselves) Sadly the campaign ended shortly after that due to scheduling conflicts. Jorym was a very kind hearted person, always doing everything he could to help those in need, whether there was something in it for him or not. He was very intimidating, standing 12 feet tall and wielding a greataxe that he balanced very well so it could be thrown, and shield that he had made himself, he was an eldritch knight, and would throw his axe at distant targets, summoning it back to his hand immediately afterwards. Not really relevant information to Fryvoras, but i thought maybe some would like to know a little more about this random character in Fryvoras' backstory :) Thanks, everyone, for reading! :D"

7924,2020-11-15 01:48:22,jqq2eo,I was wondering the same thing and glad I found this post. I’m not sure how familiar you are with comedy but Tom Segura and Christina P’s “Your Moms House” podcast network is very successful. Multiple shows coming out on different days throughout the week. They have enough of a following to make it happen
7925,2020-11-09 22:07:06,jqpxvi,"Great review! I read the whole thing 😊

I 100% agree about the need for better blind spot warning, in the mirrors. 

Another thing I'd put in improvements is a rear window wiper."
7926,2020-11-09 03:59:44,jqpxvi,"Nice post. Here are my additions.  
The cost section is off, it is $37,990 for an SR+ for example.  
One of the best points to owning a Model 3 vs owning a BMW 3 series is depreciation.  
Depending on your speed, it's not safe to drive 1 car length behind someone. I just googled this for a rule of thumb answer, and it says have 1 car length for every 10 mph, so 55 mph should be 5.5 car lengths."

Akers especially could be a decent stash as we have seen both Swift and Dobbins have good games coming out of their bye and so maybe something similar could happen with Akers."

>The Gibson thing is Mainly that Rivera refuses to use Gibson on Negative Game scripts.

>Its not really something new either but has been a common theme this year.


People just don't understand why a guy who played receiver last year wouldn't be in on pass downs (reasonable) and the answer is probably pass blocking as I alluded to. But you would think it would be more minor since McKissic was rarely staying in to block and Gibson was out to the point he didn't get a touch in the last 17 minutes of the game and they lost.

McKisic is a solid back and I could see why you would want him in more on 3rd downs. Though I would want my back of the future to get some experience there too. The thing I don't understand is why he is always in when they are down."
8017,2020-11-09 04:54:27,jqpvr2,Eh Murray and Taysom also ran it a lot and they really didn’t need Kamara. Davis will get that entire backfield if CMC is injured. I think in this case Davis will be pretty valuable
8018,2020-11-09 18:30:17,jqpvr2,Lol yeah I never understand people hating on other leagues. Fantasy brings out the salt
8019,2020-11-09 13:44:56,jqpvr2,This is the most confusing thing to me. You’re dealing with a guy who was a former WR. Catching balls is his skill set!! Why aren’t you throwing to him???? 100% has to be pass blocking. Give him another year under his belt and he’ll take all the work- not happening this year.
8020,2020-11-09 16:08:27,jqpvr2,"What if, and maybe this is too much to ask, they just played them both at the same time. Seeing a rb split out wide in a trips formation is fucking spooky, especially when that rb also could just run a drag route or something."
8021,2020-11-09 06:06:26,jqpvr2,Kamara was injured earlier in the practice so it was the smart thing to do to limit his usage when they didn't need him

8029,2020-12-15 16:08:20,kdnwdg,Dru Samia has to be the worst guard I’ve ever watched play in the NFL
8030,2020-12-15 16:16:46,kdnwdg,"I agree with everything on here as a Vikings fan, though I’m not opposed to picking a QB that falls to us in the first if it’s not a reach. I’m not an NDSU stan or anything, but if a guy like Lance falls to us, I think a year or two behind Kirk would be a great situation. 

If Lance ends up being ready to start in year two, then so be it. But we have an ideal offense for Lance that is young and doesn’t project to have any meaningful turnover for at least 3-4 years, and I think Kirk is a guy that would legitimately look out for Lance because he knows he’ll be just fine in getting paid on whoever he goes to after us.

I’m still happy with Kirk, but the opportunity tickles me."
8031,2020-12-15 17:19:32,kdnwdg,"Some thoughts as a fellow Vikings fan:

- Agreed on OL. We need to find a guard and a tackle OR two guards, depending how they feel about Cleveland playing LT vs LG.

- Agreed on 3T as well, although I think Stephen is better alongside Pierce than he is playing the NT alongside Jaleel Johnson this year. It’s a big need, but not our top need by any means.

- Again, agree on safety. My bet is Harrison is a Viking for life, but we really need to replace Harris since we’re in cap hell.

- I like the idea of adding a CB, but not until mid day three. Hughes hasn’t looked bad, he just hasn’t been healthy, and IMO Dantzler and Gladney are the future outside corners. I think it’s more likely we add depth via free agency vets than through the draft though as we are VERY young at the position. Hughes was our 2018 1st rounder and he is our most experienced corner...

- Regarding LB, Wilson has been great but it’s also been evident he can’t replace Barr IMO. He flashes high level of play but is really inconsistent. He’s an exceptional LB3, but I don’t think I trust him fully in the Barr role yet on defense. I also think Troy Dye who we drafted last year has had some flashes and I think he provides some nice future developing depth. I think we do grab another LB in day three, but maybe not so high depending on other needs we still have (since we don’t have a 2nd rounder this year).

- We need a backup QB, whether a vet or via the draft. Mannion is great in the QB room, but a nightmare on the field. Browning has looked bad. Stanley, as smart as he is in the QB room, has looked equally awful on the field. At this point, if Cousins goes down, so does our season IMO.

- Here is where I heavily disagree. We don’t need a WR3. We have that in Bisi. Beebe has been our WR4 AT BEST. There’s always something to be said about grabbing WRs late, but if we do grab one, it’s a punt returner who can fill in as low end WR depth, not someone to be a reliable WR3.

I agree with the rest of the needs. My one major point of contention is it would really surprise me to see Barr get cut. Vikings fans really seem to underrate his role in a Zimmer defense and I think Barr is as much a focal point of this defense that I would put him, Harrison Smith, and Kirk Cousins as equally likely to get cut."
8032,2020-12-15 17:17:27,kdnwdg,"Perfectly summed it up. This is who I think we should be targetting:

1st: Best OL available with preference to iOL. Wyatt Davis, Creed Humphrey are my favorites.

3rd: With two picks, I'm hoping a solid safety and DT fall to us. One of the TCU guys, maybe Ford or Cisco. 

Then I really like Newman/King/Ridder as developmental/backup QBs in the 4th-6th round range. All are electric on the ground but have inconsistent arms. 

I do think that TE will be somewhat of a need, especially if we cut Rudy. Irv is great. Conk is solid. But I don't totally trust Conk yet, and we are lacking in depth at that position without Rudy."
8033,2020-12-15 22:15:47,kdnwdg,"Like, every single mock I see has you guys taking Wyatt Davis, which I highly recommend as a Buckeye fan...Of course, I also would have highly recommended Pat Elfein too, which I am sorry for..

No, but Davis is different, like Q Nelson different...hope he falls to you guys and you don't overthink it..."
8034,2020-12-15 17:23:30,kdnwdg,"Nice writeup, as a Vikings fan also I agree on the team needs. 

I think it's likely that Rudolph is a restructure to a more team-friendly deal, not a straight cut. He seems to like MN and won't attract big offers in free agency. 

You also have Reiff as a cut, but starting as LT in the depth chart. And I disagree that they resign all 3 of Dozier, Hill, and Jones."
8035,2020-12-15 17:08:23,kdnwdg,"Idk how they could keep Bailey after his struggles the past couple weeks.  I wouldn’t be surprised if he was gone by the end of the week, let alone the end of the year."
8036,2020-12-15 20:13:19,kdnwdg,We currently have just two interior offensive linemen signed for 2021. Bradbury and Samia. Samia has looked awful. I suspect whoever our two starting guards are in 2021 they are not currently on the roster unless we pick a tackle in round 1 and Cleveland stays at guard.
8037,2020-12-15 23:46:44,kdnwdg,Richie Grant out of UCF would be a good pick around round 3.
8038,2020-12-15 18:26:47,kdnwdg,"Hey, thanks for doing this write-up and doing so much work! I’m gonna disagree with you on a few things but I think you did a great job hitting on most of the important stuff.

So I don’t think Wilson’s a good replacement for Barr. Barr’s biggest attribute, in addition to being good in pass coverage, is eating up blocks at the second level to free up tacklers in run support and making plays behind/at the LOS. 

Wilson, conversely, is awful (like, *awful* awful) in run defense and it has killed us this year, not to mention he’s league-average in coverage. It’s easy to look at his turnover numbers and think he’s great, but the advanced metrics just don’t support the production; most of it is luck/circumstantial. “Being around the ball” isn’t really a skill in and of itself, and neither is making a bunch of tackles. A lot of times, that means you were out of position or gave up a catch and are compensating for your mistake. I don’t give a ton of credence to PFF grades, but Wilson’s never scored within the same stratosphere as Barr’s average over a full season.

Tackle shouldn’t be a need. Either you keep Reiff, who is a really solid tackle, or you go to Ezra who’s your future plan with O’Neill on the other side. If you’re going OL, it has to be a guard. And I’m all for that - reach for Davis or Humphrey, this shit needs to be fixed. And FWIW, I hope the plan is to slide Ezra back outside. Idk if it’s necessarily in our best interest to cut Reiff right away, but Ezra is not the answer at guard. 

Three tech? Yup. Gotta have that. I think Stephen is just fine, he’s been solid this year, but the rest of em gotta go. And even Stephen becomes pretty obsolete with Pierce coming back.

Definitely need a safety. It’s gonna be tough though, because this year’s class is pretty weak at that spot. We’ll see what happens there, but I’d be okay with slumming it for another year and trying our hand in the 2022 draft. Smith should be great for another season and I’m sure we can find someone to replace Harris’s subpar production.

Gotta have a CB mid-rounds imo, but like you said, not really a huge concern as of now. Dantzler and Gladney are awesome.

DO NOT DRAFT SPECIALISTS. The last three specialists we’ve drafted have been Osborn/Cutting/Carlson. The best of that bunch has been league average, the other two have been miserable. So far, spending late picks on specialists has done nothing but bite us in the ass. Just sign Tavon Austin or some shit in FA, anyone that can catch a punt and run forward will do. 

As far as kickers go, I guess I’m okay with drafting one late as long as they’ll commit to sticking with him for at least a full season. Otherwise, stick it out with Bailey another year; 2/9 is not something he’s likely to repeat. Kickers go through these types of stretches.

I think LB is a greater need than we realize and I’d be okay with us taking one sooner rather than later. Barr and Kendricks are aging a bit, Wilson is fool’s gold, Dye has been hot garbage, and Cam Smith got cancer. Would be nice to grab another big body for the second level.

The rest of the positions are pretty whatever. However, I’d like us to take a TE. We run a lot and need another solid TE for heavy sets, plus we enjoy getting more than 1 TE involved in the passing game anyway. Conklin’s fine but he shouldn’t be a TE2 imo, same goes for Dillon. 

Great write-up, thanks again for the work!!"
8039,2020-12-15 17:17:00,kdnwdg,"We have Nate Stanley on the practice squad. He has the physical traits to be a good nfl backup QB. I disagree on the TE aspect. We run a ton of 2 tight end sets to the point where Irv is basically the WR 3 of the squad. I don't see Rudy being cut, but i think his contract will be restructured. 

One thing i could see happening at DE is Steven Weatherly being cut from Carolina and signing back with Minnesota for cheap since he had success here. With Waddum, Weatherly, and Odenigbo being the rotation that would be pretty strong. 

I agree on CB, but don't forget that we have Harrison Hand, who is only 20, so he can develop into that solid 4th guy. But i would for sure be down for grabbing more depth.  


Overall well done man. I also think we will be able to trade Barr since he's still a stud in the back end of his prime. Could see us getting something like a 3rd and a 5th for him."
8040,2020-12-15 17:35:51,kdnwdg,"Nice write up. I see you cut Reiff, but also have him as the starting left tackle. Would you keep Hill as the starter? Move Cleveland/O'Neil to the left side?"
8041,2020-12-15 18:17:39,kdnwdg,I agree. With OLine being the biggest need. I wrote a mock draft yesterday with the Vikings getting Rashawn Slater. I thought about Wyatt Davis but I haven’t been super impressed by him this year. He would also be a great addition though
8042,2020-12-16 14:16:07,kdnwdg,"Love what you tried here!!

But let's take a step back and remember some stuff. Cousins will be here for sure. We need an edge, 3 tech, LG, WR, CB, LB, S - and depth along various areas like a RB would be nice. Alright, so Wyatt Davis Guard from Ohio State. 2nd round 3 tech. Jay Tuflele from USC Jaylen Twyiaman from Pitt. 3rd round we should look at LB Chazz Surratt from North Carolina or Shaka Toney edge from Penn State. TEs such as Hunter Long from Boston College as well. 

Who are we cutting? Definitely Rudolph, don't be surprised if we cut and resign or flat out cut, CJ Ham, Adam Thielen, Harrison Smith, Kyle Rudolph, Reiff, and Dan Bailey. 

Say we cut Ham, Thielen, Smith, Rudolph, Reiff, Bailey, and Shamar - we'd be at 17.6 million. Which is actually closer to 10 million considering we want 5-8 for the draft. And then that mean usually saving 2-5 million for the whole year. So all in all we end up with 5 million just from cutting those players after starting negative 12 million, not signing any free agents, restructuring any contracts or drafting any rookies."
8043,2020-12-15 17:16:56,kdnwdg,"Great write up! I completely agree with pretty much everything. OL and DB are our biggest needs and should be addressed early with DL being a tier behind those in needs. I'd be curious to see how some of our young DL perform when attention is focused on Hunter and Pierce next year.

How can you ignore rounds 5-7?! You know we'll have at least six picks in those rounds. GMs love to trade those almost useless picks to Rick in order to move up in the earlier rounds. It frustrates me every single year.

Your cuts are spot on as well with the exception of Reiff. I could see us trying to restructure his contract again in order to keep him. Barr and Rudy are gone along with Harris and Kirk is impossible to cut."
8044,2020-12-16 10:05:40,kdnwdg,"I don't agree with cutting Riley Reiff. He's a good OT that's worth paying. The Vikings already cut a bunch of guys and they aren't in cap hell. Everybody is going to be trying to find money next year, but cutting Reiff isn't the way to do it. Maybe you can extend/restructure him to push money into the future, but don't make a weak OL massively weaker by getting rid of the strong point and creating a hole at a premium position. Also, it seems like you want to cut Reiff and then re-sign him, but that doesn't make sense because you'd have to pay the $2.2M Dead Cap and then assume that he will take $11.9M just to break even while he's on the open market. For him, he'd be much better off going to a place that wants him more than the Vikings at that point, and good players at premium positions generally increase in cost, not decrease. An extension/restructure would make so much more sense. He gets more guaranteed money to push the cap hit into the future.

The Vikings are kind of in a weird spot in terms of roster space. They picked 15 players last Draft and now have 10 picks this Draft, although only 1 in Round One, 0 in Round Two, 2 in Round Three, and then 7 on Day 3. That's a lot of mid-to-late round picks to fit onto the roster, yet those picks don't have a lot of value for moving up. Dan Bailey's struggles are helping, though, because now it's pretty easy for the Vikings to use a late pick on a Kicker and cut Bailey. Improve the team while saving money.

Cutting Thielen makes a lot of sense to me. I know he's beloved in Minnesota and they just got rid of Diggs via trade, but Minnesota can save $8.1M ($11.7M with a post-June 1 cut) and Jefferson has proven he can be a WR1 having already broken 1,000 yards receiving this year. WR is also a position where Minnesota can use one of those Day 3 picks and still get a contributor and WR isn't a premium position, especially not WR2. That would also allow the Vikings to keep Rudolph and run two TE sets with Rudolph and Smith, Cook at RB, Jefferson at WR and then whoever else at WR between Beebe, Johnson or a draft pick. Or the Vikings can cut out the 2nd WR and go heavier with the FB. This might be a little unlikely because it wasn't that long ago where Thielen signed his contract, but they didn't know about the pandemic at that time, either."
8045,2020-12-15 17:23:06,kdnwdg,Agreed. We would need to walk away with Wilson or Lance to take a QB early IMO. I don’t think Jones/Trask has the upside under Kirk in our offense that we would be tempted to grab either one in the first.
8046,2020-12-15 17:28:40,kdnwdg,"I don't have a strong opinion on Lance either way yet, but I think it's a waste to potentially sit a first round QB for two years with the rookie contract being such an advantage."
8047,2020-12-15 18:43:40,kdnwdg,"> Agreed on 3T as well, although I think Stephen is better alongside Pierce than he is playing the NT alongside Jaleel Johnson this year. It’s a big need, but not our top need by any means.

Stephen ranked 112th among interior linemen in total pressures in 2019 while playing next to a NT. 

He isn't worth the 5 million cap hit, imo. Cut him and make 3T a high priority in the draft, next to OG and S."

Depending on cap casualties and age-related decline, I think you can shift CB-LB-WR to 'depth'. You can easily add some extra OL positions as well, the only offensive interior linemen under contract for the '21 season are Bradbury and Samia.

> 2nd round 3 tech. Jay Tuflele from USC Jaylen Twyiaman from Pitt.

The Vikings don't have a second round pick and I'd be surprised if Spielman trades up to pick a lineman, especially if he already hypothetically drafted Davis in the first.

> 3rd round we should look at LB Chazz Surratt from North Carolina or Shaka Toney edge from Penn State.

3rd round is the perfect moment to find Harris' successor at safety, imo.

> Say we cut Ham, Thielen, Smith, Rudolph, Reiff, Bailey, and Shamar

Reiff, Rudolph, Bailey, and Shamar? Absolutely. 

Thielen, Smith, and Ham though? Not a chance. 

I'm fairly certain Thielen's contract stays as it is. Smith's contract is an easy restructure. Ham's contract stays the same as well, you're not cutting the FB that enables our run game and only has a 3 million dollar cap hit."
8051,2020-12-15 23:16:31,kdnwdg,"> OL and DB are our biggest needs and should be addressed early with DL being a tier behind those in needs.

When these are the team needs I would still rather go DL in round 1. Viks would be really scary with a stud DT/Edge next to Hunter and those other positions are generally easier to address in the 2-4 rounds. 

The whole ""biggest need = round 1"" thinking generally doesn't match reality."

8053,2020-12-15 18:45:18,kdnwdg,Yeah that’s my big thing is it would have to be someone worth the upside. I don’t want to be in a situation like Jordan Love where it’s just someone that was drafted at a just okay value at a low urgency need when other BPA values  at more pressing needs are available.
8054,2020-12-15 18:40:37,kdnwdg,"I agree that sitting for two years is sub-optimal, but I don’t view it as a waste. You’re still getting 2 years of essentially free QB play, and then one year of solidly discounted QB play if he warrants a 5th year election.

Anything over 3 years I’d certainly agree that the cost/benefit doesn’t add up, but at that point I think you’d have to give up on a guy that hasn’t shown ability to start by year 3 anyway.

Ideally I’d like our rookie to be ready to take the reigns in the second training camp, and like I said earlier, I think Kirk is a guy that would be a positive influence and would obviously be an incredible, yet officially overpaid, backup for a year.

In the event that we have a franchise QB that we believe can outplay Kirk year two, I think it’s a problem any team would be happy to manage for a year."
8055,2020-12-15 19:05:11,kdnwdg,"I mean, he’s currently converting only 66% of his attempts plus he’s below 90% on XPs.  If I can save a million in cap with at minimum the same production with upside for significant MLK better, idk how you turn that down."
8056,2020-12-16 02:37:54,kdnwdg,He's still under contract for next year although the problem is it's for $14m. No way we keep him at that price and with just $2m dead cap on him. If he stays it's going to be for around $7m. He renegotiated to stay this year so we'll see. He definitely likes playing here. He's an average left tackle but even average left tackles have value in today's NFL.
8057,2020-12-16 16:50:59,kdnwdg,"WR I think is more important than we let on. Thielen could easily hit his age wall any year now and we need a viable WR3. Most teams do. I know we don't have a 2nd rounder, but I want us to. Meaning we trade down. If you see my picture here this is something I'd love. These players will move around a lot more. I wouldn't say not a chance to those three. My guess is we restructure at least 2 of those 3, and even possibly cut and bring back at least 1 of those. Saying not a chance is a silly thing to say in a game of uncertainty. Problem with not cutting or restructing means it happens elsewhere when we need to extend O'Neil and resign the new free agents from our team or any other free agents.

Did some trading around. But this is the result.

So yes, the Vikings are projected to need to clear about $7.5M, but that's within reason. We don't even know what the final salary cap will be, because it might be higher than the floor. I don't even consider the Packers to be in cap hell and we need to come up with nearly $19M. The Saints and Eagles are the ones in real cap hell, where the Saints need to clear over $94M and the Eagles over $65.7M."

8065,2020-12-15 15:49:06,kdnig4,I still don’t understand why TE is so low.  Getting a great tight end is more valuable then a great wide receiver.  Most coaches talk about the nightmare mismatches guys like Kittle and Kelce cause.  Even lower tier TEs cause mismatches like Hayden Hurst.  I get that the analytics show that WR has more value but I don’t wholly buy it.
8066,2020-12-15 19:13:54,kdnig4,"I am fine with your draft.  I just disagree with your positional value.

Also, did you just want to do a different type of draft, or do you really think teams don't emphasize position value enough?  If not, what do you think teams value mostly in the draft (if draft criteria is something like position, production, talent, potential, athleticism, team needs), and how high should positional value be?"
8067,2020-12-17 16:31:01,kdnig4,"I’d push back on the idea that Miami’s rookie OTs have shown little promise. It’s the interior of that line where they need help, particularly with the run game."

Plus the cap space will help them build around Wilson more than they would be able to with Dak."

8075,2020-12-15 16:41:35,kdnig4,"I think Rondale Moore is underrated. I think he has game breaking ability similar to Tyreek Hill. He is also great after the catch. I think pairing him with Hopkins would make the cardinals offense one of the toughest to defend in the league. I think there will be CB and IOL value available in the 2nd round, but nothing close to what Moore can offer at the receiver position"
8076,2020-12-15 16:01:41,kdnig4,"Yeah, I would probably put pass rusher at 2 behind QB. I think OL (especially OTs) should actually be higher too just because there’s such a limited supply. In contrast, there are a lot of really good WRs, so I would probably put them a good bit lower. Maybe something like:

QB > EDGE > OL(OT) > CB > WR

Those five spots are pretty clearly the most valuable to me though, regardless of the order."
8077,2020-12-15 16:08:23,kdnig4,"Because you can't reliably draft someone at Kittle or Kelce's level. If you're taking someone in the first round, I think a reasonable hope for that player is that they develop into a top 10 player at the position. More likely they end up top 20. The generic top 10/20 WR is much more valuable than the generic top 10/20 TE.

And you said it yourself that lower tier TEs can cause mismatches. You don't need to highly prioritize a great TE to get that value."
8078,2020-12-15 20:17:31,kdnig4,"Hayden Hurst does not cause mismatches. Julio and Ridley create space vacated in the middle of the field that Hurst simply has to run in to. Also keep in mind, just as picking a running back in the first round provides no cost effectiveness, neither does tight end. Picking a tight end high in the first will immediately make that player one of the highest paid at the position. If the tight end ends up being good and getting a big contract, it's not providing nearly as much of an advantage as getting an elite receiver on a rookie deal. Basically, look at the difference in the franchise tag numbers and the contracts that first round picks get."
8079,2020-12-15 16:05:19,kdnig4,"I think its because of how productive receivers are compared to tight ends. There are only 4 or 5 TEs in the league right now that produce similar numbers to the top 50 WRs. I think it also has to do with how much TE production can be schemed up. Look at Hooper last year compared to this year. Obviously Kittle and Kelce are among the most valuable players in the league, but they are so incredibly rare."
8080,2020-12-15 16:55:48,kdnig4,"I think of positional value literally.  Highest positional value is the most expensive contract to get in FA (QB).  Other expensive positions are Pass Rusher, OT, WR, CB.  The positional value of a draft pick is can you get that production on a rookie contract that would have otherwise cost you a lot of cap space if you had to source that position elsewhere"
8081,2020-12-16 00:40:04,kdnig4,"My positional value was based on WAR by position. I do think that teams don’t draft by positional value enough. I think teams make the safe pick, rather than the one that is best for their team. I think positional value should be the number one factor considered when drafting. Needs should be addressed in Free Agency."

8083,2020-12-15 16:36:16,kdnig4,"Lol we have one of the best sets of weapons in the league with a QB who is an established starter and those weapons cant elevate him. Dalton looks terrible even with all these weapons. Turns out, the weapons dont make the QB, the QB makes the weapons.

Your evaluation of Dak is way off and as such makes your pick terrible."
8084,2020-12-15 19:40:32,kdnig4,You actually just compared Jimmy G to Dak Prescott lmao go watch more Skip Bayless
8085,2020-12-15 17:32:38,kdnig4,"I also think the Cowboys should take a hard look at drafting a QB if they can land a top 4 pick. Dak Prescott is good, but they will no longer have the advantage of building around his rookie contract. I agree that Dak is probably closer to the Matt Ryan and Kirk Cousins tier than the Drew Brees and Big Ben tier, and the Cowboy’s window to compete with Dak is probably over until they can cycle out bad contracts and reload talent on defense.

The main problem is that while their receivers are great, their O-Line and run game kind of suck this year. Andy Dalton has also played really bad, which contradicts my theory that they are a great situation to slide a rookie QB in. They are also already kind of in cap hell without Dak on the books, so while a Rookie QB would help a little, they probably wouldn’t have enough space for a game changer like Patrick Peterson or Von Miller to help fix their defense.

I would say they should draft a QB, sign a guy like Cory Linsley in FA, and accept that they will be picking in the top 10 again next year and use that pick to address defense. They will have an opportunity to get some good free agents once they can get off Zeke’s contract in 2-3 years"
8086,2020-12-15 17:00:38,kdnig4,Dak both is and isn't worth $40M.  He isn't by himself but they are going to waste this set of skill players without him (as we have seen this year) so you may have to just pay up.
8087,2020-12-15 16:34:56,kdnig4,"I actually made a post recently talking about taking an elite LB when the rest of your defense is bad. Basically I think it’s a pretty bad choice. We have zero pass rush and struggle in coverage. Pass rush is a massive hole, so I’d take Paye."
8088,2020-12-15 16:09:14,kdnig4,"The reason pass rusher is so “low” is because of how much easier it is to scheme up pressure compared to coverage. Look at the Ravens last year as a great example. They had elite coverage, which allowed them to still get great pressure by being creative with blitzes. Their mediocre pass rush talent was still successful overall. But this wouldn’t be possible without great coverage."

8094,2020-12-15 16:45:49,kdnig4,Completely fair. I appreciate the feedback. The  Falcons are in a great position to get an impact player on defense. Hopefully it’s giving you something to look forward to.
8095,2020-12-15 16:28:08,kdnig4,"I guess that’s fair. Given my flair, I would argue scheming up pressure isn’t that easy, otherwise everyone would do it using bargain bin pass rushers. And similarly to how elite coverage can help your pass rush, a good pass rush can make decent DBs look better because they don’t have to hold up as long in coverage. They really go hand-in-hand."
8096,2020-12-15 20:22:41,kdnig4,Hayden Hurst will finish this season with less than 600 yards and was useless in every game that Julio missed. Belichick is more than capable of talking up players that don't deserve it.
8097,2020-12-15 19:37:44,kdnig4,Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow
8098,2020-12-15 17:10:22,kdnig4,"Your pick was made off an opinion that wasnt really ever true, and after seeing the offense this year should have dissapeared. Ergo, its a terrible pick"
8099,2020-12-15 18:50:06,kdnig4,"I don't care for the way he said it, but I agree with his evaluation.  I think Dalton at the helm losing games after being called the best backup in the league proves that Dak is a good QB and that you may be off-base in your evaluation of what the Cowboys can get away with.  

If I was them, I would have let Zeke walk and extended Dak in the first place.  But moving on from that, they should probably be drafting secondary players."
8100,2020-12-15 20:46:32,kdnig4,Hahaha ♥️ u more
8101,2020-12-15 17:45:08,kdnig4,"I believe that unless you have a top tier QB (Brady, Rodgers, Wilson, Mahomes, Brees, Big Ben), your team will only be a contender with a great roster around them. I don’t think the current Cowboys roster is good at all, and I think if the team sticks with Dak, they will be a 5-9 win team for the foreseeable future. Drafting a guy like Wilson gives them the opportunity to both find an elite QB who can elevate their roster while also giving them the cap advantage to try and build a contender around him."
8102,2020-12-15 16:37:14,kdnig4,They definitely go hand-in-hand. And it’s obviously not crazy easy to scheme up a good pass rush. But I do believe that it’s easier to scheme up than good coverage. A bad pass rusher is easier to hide than a bad corner.
8103,2020-12-15 20:00:18,kdnig4,Tbf we don’t know if the opinion wasn’t true but his opinion pissed you off for being so low on Dak
8104,2020-12-15 17:48:13,kdnig4,"Bruh. They already have an elite QB. When Dak was healthy there was MAYBE 4 QBs better. We were putting up 33 points a game. Without Dak, with the same offense, we dropped to around 15. Literally cut our offensive production in half.

Drafting a QB would be by far the dumbest thing we could possibly do. It would solve nothing and only create more issues like being worse at the QB position and a major locker room issue."
8105,2020-12-15 20:16:06,kdnig4,We do know that opinion wasnt true tho. Dak has been incredibly consistent outside of the one stretch where Scott Linehan decided WRBC was a good idea and Jason decided to kill his own QB.
8106,2020-12-15 18:09:28,kdnig4,"I reserve the top tier for the guys who can make the playoffs every year (barring injuries or historically bad defenses). After that there is a drop off to guys like Matt Ryan, Kirk Cousins, Matt Stafford, Jared Goff who are good but can only contend when they are surrounded by the right scheme or supporting cast. I think the only way to sustain success in the nfl is to have an elite quarterback, and if you don’t have one you will get at best a 3 year window if you can build a great defense. For the Cowboys, that window is likley already closed."
8107,2020-12-15 20:23:24,kdnig4,Then would it be an opinion or is he just wrong haha
8108,2020-12-15 18:10:16,kdnig4,So you reserve the top tier for individiual rankings based on a team achievement. Makes sense.
8109,2020-12-15 20:50:32,kdnig4,I think Watson and Prescott are both examples of why that formula is wrong. Did you know Mitch has a higher career winning % than Deshaun? He must be better
8110,2020-12-15 19:07:05,kdnig4,"So why would they not re-sign Dak, cut Tyron Smith, and draft an OT, maybe move up a spot if they need Sewell, then spend the rest of the off-season improving the defense?  Or re-sign Dak, cut Smith and sign someone who is competent, then spend the entire draft on defense.

Dak, a healthy, average LT, Collins and Martin returning, and if they hit on just one secondary player, that should be enough for them to be playing meaningful games in December.  Their offense was already playoff caliber with Dak, it was the defense that couldn't stop anybody.

&#x200B;

Then after the 21 season, cut Zeke because that was a mistake and Pollard is good, then spend more resources on the defense since the offense will be solved."
8111,2020-12-15 20:23:48,kdnig4,He is just wrong
8112,2020-12-15 19:20:05,kdnig4,"I think that only a select few quarterbacks are transcendent. When you look at the success the Packers, Patriots, Saints, Seahwks, Steelers, etc. have had this century, it’s pretty clear what the constant is. Over a large enough sample with different schemes, supporting casts, and defensive gameplans, sustained success can absolutely be attributed to a quarterback.

Dak should be an easy enough QB to evaluate. We’ve seen him with a great O-line, great running game, good defense. We have a good idea of what the ceiling of a Dak Prescott team looks like. I don’t think they need to move on from him for nothing, but if they have a chance to get a guy like Justin Fields or even Zach Wilson, they should consider it. I think there are plenty of other teams in the league like the 49ers, Vikings, Falcons, and maybe even the Rams that would gladly choose a top qb prospect over their current guy if they weren’t stuck with the contract"
8113,2020-12-15 21:28:38,kdnig4,"The initial window is probably closed for the Texans and they will have trouble without their picks and cap the next few years, but I actually do think Watson could be a top tier guy when it’s all said and done. Mitch is an example of why a rookie contract is so valuable in today’s nfl because he was a complete miss, and they still had one year where they were arguably contenders"
8114,2020-12-15 19:31:07,kdnig4,"If Sewell is there, I think he would be an easy pick but I think he will be coveted too highly by the Bengals. They could absolutely transform their defense if they can land a stud CB as well, but that depends on their evaluation of guys like Farley and Surtain. I think if they hit on a qb in the draft that can be 80% of what Dak is, they will be better off long term with the extra 30 mil in cap to spend over the next 3 years."
8115,2020-12-15 20:40:34,kdnig4,True
8116,2020-12-15 19:21:50,kdnig4,"You know everyone of those ""transcendent"" QBs has experienced down years several times. Hell Drew Brees had 3 straight years of 8-8 or worse"
8117,2020-12-15 21:36:57,kdnig4,"You’re missing the whole point, qb play is just one part of the team. I understand you are saying once the elite qb’s contract is finally completed you can focus on other parts but it’s hilarious that you don’t see how much of a crap shoot it is. I’m sure there are plenty of amazing qb’s who have been forgotten about because their team surrounding them was always trash. Btw imo Watson is pretty much as talented of a qb as Mahomes, maybe a little less, but his team has been god awful the entire time. Put him on the Chiefs and he wins last year as well."
8118,2020-12-15 20:25:44,kdnig4,"QB is literally the hardest position to hit on in the draft.  They are much more likely to not hit on a QB and enter QB purgatory like half the NFL is in now.  That is why when you have one, you keep him.  I disagree they will be better off with the money.  I think they will be better off with a QB they know can give them the opportunity to win, than gambling with the draft.  

Besides I don't personally think that any QB not named Lawrence should be starting next year anyway, but that's my though."
8119,2020-12-15 20:56:18,kdnig4,"Those Saints teams were some of the worst defenses in NFL history. When they had even a halfway decent team, they were serious contenders. Generally the same goes for the other guys I mentioned, although the group is admittedly identified through hindsight"
8120,2020-12-15 20:56:47,kdnig4,Did you know Dan Marino never won a super bowl?!
8121,2020-12-15 22:20:24,kdnig4,"I definitely agree on Watson, and it was clearly the right choice to give him the extension as they really had no other option. Obviously drafting rookie QBs is a high risk/high reward play, but I personally would consider rolling the dice if they like one of the top three guys. If they could land a guy like Burrow, Tua, or Herbert, I think it would definitely be worth it. It’s easy for me as a fan to say that drafting a QB isn’t a crapshoot, but it seems to me like most QBs drafted bust because they are either put in terrible situations or because they were never really that good anyway. A team like the Cowboy’s is in a decent situation because they don’t need to do a full rebuild if they choose a new QB."
8122,2020-12-15 21:06:09,kdnig4,"It’s hard to hit on a QB for sure, but I believe a team like the Cowboys with a decent offense is in a good place to do it. At the very least, they have enough offensive weapons to accurately evaluate their QB, while a team like the Jet’s or Giants may be stuck for 3-4 years before they can decide whether or not their QB is the problem"
8123,2020-12-15 20:58:10,kdnig4,">Those Saints teams were some of the worst defenses in NFL history

Oh man. You are this close to being self aware, so let me help you. THATS THE POINT. Team success has NOTHING to do with individual play. Several teams have been to the playoffs despite bad QB play and several teams have missed despite really fucking good QB play.

The bottom line is, when you have elite QB play like Dak, you dont abandon it for a prospect that you HOPE will be as good as Dak"
8124,2020-12-15 20:58:40,kdnig4,He must be terrible!
8125,2020-12-15 22:45:42,kdnig4,Just wanted to say this is a fun topic and you are being really cool about it so ty!
8126,2020-12-15 22:40:07,kdnig4,"Well trust me, it is much more of a crapshoot than what you just described haha obviously o-line is a big deal for rookies and probably THE thing teams should fix first when getting a rookie qb BUT there is a lot more that goes into it. Some qb’s have the talent to survive those lines, some can survive a bad rookie year, some need a year or two to develop. I think that people underrate Dak is a mix of him being on the cowboys, his record, and his o-line. I don’t know of any other qb we criticize more for having a good o-line than Dak. Hell, Rodgers has an amazing line rn and nobody shits on him for it (I’m glad they don’t) so why him?"
8127,2020-12-15 22:55:47,kdnig4,"Yeah the Dak Prescott decision is one of the more interesting storylines of the next offseason to me so it’s fun to hash out now. I actually saw a PFF mock today that had Wilson to the Cowboys, so I’m sure by the time the draft is here it will be done to death by Skip Bayless, Analytics Twitter, and every armchair gm like me"
8128,2020-12-15 23:09:57,kdnig4,Lmao that’s half the fun tho! Honestly I would love to get Wilson but I don’t see that happening

[Look, it’s not that hard. All you need to do is lift weights six days a week, stop drinking alcohol, don’t eat anything after 7pm, don’t eat any carbs or sugar at all, in fact just don’t eat anything you like, get the personal trainer from Magic Mike, sleep nine hours a night, run three miles a day, and have a studio pay for the whole thing over a six to seven month span. I don’t know why everyone’s not doing this. It’s a super realistic lifestyle and an appropriate body image to compare oneself to. #hollywood](https://www.instagram.com/p/BnXtEz1BLFP/)

8346,2020-12-15 22:44:08,kdlxru,Being in this sub ruins the skit a bit but its a A+ skit though
8347,2020-12-15 14:54:16,kdlxru,every male star in the marvel movies took PEDs. the rock takes PEDs. kumail nanjiani took PEDs. almost every male A lister after a certain age takes PEDs
8348,2020-12-15 21:25:11,kdlxru,"The rule is, if they have a monetary reason to be in good shape, odds are 95% and up they take PEDs, and if its just for fun and they look really good the odds are still 50/50, they're tons more prevalent that people want to belive, why wouldn't they? The side effects are overblown, still present mind you, but way overblown. If you're going for the olympia and doing unreal amounts then yeah you're gonna have some shit go wrong but just keeping yourself in pretty good shape on a busy schedule doesnt take much."

Edit: and of course not cleaning after yourself, claiming multiple devices/benches at the same time and generally not leaving everything the way you found them.

8420,2020-12-15 19:49:18,kdlxru,"I sort of agree. Resources definitely make things easier, but ultimately it's a matter of discipline. Will Smith is an incredibly disciplined person (based on stories/quotes I've heard - in reality I have no idea). 

The average person may not have the resources to look like Smith, but the average person isn't near as fit as they COULD be with what they have to work with. The difference between who a person is and who a person could be is discipline. With more resources they would still lack that internal thing that keeps them from achieving their potential.

People say something similar about money. Like, ""If only I had money I'd be more generous and invest, etc."" Like fitness, it's not really true. I think it was Dave Ramsay who said, ""Money doesn't change who you are, it makes you more of who you already are"""

They reluctantly 'confessed' that their best was a very low number.

I kept tying to tell them how awesome that is and that anyone has to start somewhere and only gets better the longer they keep at it, they shouldn't feel bad etc. but I kept feeling like everything out of my mouth seemed condescending, trying my best to be sincere.

So I get how simply ignoring others working out might be the best choice good intention may very much be interpreted very negatively.

I don't go to the Gym but I still think it's true, most people either don't care or are genuinely happy to see someone work out and be healthy.

I can't imagine putting all that effort into a healthy body just to play gatekeeper and look down on others, yes those people exist but I'm sure they're few."

More important than time or a personal chef or a Peloton is to be in a place where you CAN give attention to your health. This can be limited by so many things! Many of which apply to both the wealthy and the poor. Sure, financial stress is definitely a stumbling block to giving fitness priority, but so is mental health, physical injury, etc.

Oh I've no doubts about that. My point is that surprisingly even after all the shady shit they're accused of (I'm shocked & surprised that the only crime proven against them is stealing docs! I was sure they murder & rape little kids like many other org. religions.. Maybe they're really good at hiding it?) they're still not even close to the top 5 evil religions! That's how messed up they are.

I think sciento have done much worse stuff than child labor camps or stealing docs, like actual murder & child rape. But they're good at hiding evidence. Maybe I'm wrong."

8655,2020-12-15 13:59:06,kdlmrd,An hour before it opens
8656,2020-12-15 14:00:55,kdlmrd,"It definitely varies by store. The trucks probably drive a huge loop from the warehouses each day so some stores will get deliveries early in the morning while others won't get their delivery until late in the day.

Not all stores make new stuff available for sale as soon as it is delivered. Some wait until after hours to put anything out then it's available the next morning. Some stores are making certain products available randomly over a few days as t he state recommended."
8657,2020-12-15 14:05:17,kdlmrd,"A lot of stores will have the cases at the register waiting for the doors to open on their delivery day.  In that situation, your only hope is to line up before the store opens and get there early enough so you are at the front of the line.  A lot of the Giant Eagles do that on Saturday regardless of their delivery day.  Some stores will trickle it out and if you get there on delivery day before they bring it out from the back, they'll say they didn't get any even if they did.  Typically the deliveries come over night, not during open store hours."
8658,2020-12-15 19:06:59,kdlmrd,"How does waiting line work?  If you're first in line, do you have the chance to buy as many different allocated bottles as you want (obviously not 2 of the same)?  Do any places hand out tickets?"

8661,2020-12-15 22:26:44,kdlmrd,"Some Giant Eagle stores (and Ale Wine & Spirits) around Columbus are known to hold back some rare bottles to [release on Saturday mornings](https://www.reddit.com/r/OhioLiquor/comments/i01v77/saturday_release/). The state also delays the visibility of these products on ohlq.com until Saturday morning. Other stores around the state could decide to do this too. You'll have to get there and wait in line before the store opens for a chance at the most sought after stuff.

I have heard rumors that EHT Barrel Proof has been going out and that's a little more expensive than the EHT Single Barrel and EHT Small Batch we've been seeing over the last few days but it shouldn't be $80-$90.

The employee might have been mistaken about the price."
8662,2020-12-15 16:33:37,kdlmrd,"Good question. They had upwards of 20 cases out at the entry. Limit was 3, which I also never see."
8663,2020-12-16 04:08:31,kdlmrd,Quite easily they’d fit. A pallet could probably hold close to 10 cases per layer and they’re usually 5-6 layers high.

8666,2020-12-15 22:04:50,kdlmrd,"I've been in line at release-time once before and they would do 1 special bottle per person per transaction. If you were first in line, you could buy your first pick, stuff it in your pocket, and hop back to the end of the line for another go at whatever might still be available. Surely it varies by store though. I've seen some giant eagle signs say 1 bottle per person per day, which may apply to specific bottles or perhaps all special bottles. Never heard of ticketing except for raffles of legitimately allocated bottles."

8676,2020-12-16 21:24:11,kdlmrd,Makes sense.. thank you!!
8677,2020-12-15 13:55:23,kdlgla,3rd pick is waaaaayyy too high to grab Patterson
8678,2020-12-15 13:18:58,kdlgla,Give me harris instead of Paterson and it's my ideal draft
8679,2020-12-15 14:22:40,kdlgla,"Other than Patterson, sign me up for this.  That’s way too high.   He’s prob a 4th rounder, give or take.  If they’re going RB in the 2nd round, I think the targets should be Chuba Hubbard or Harris.  But I’d be ecstatic if they went WR + Humphrey in the first."
8680,2020-12-15 14:00:31,kdlgla,"If we draft Patterson in the second round with our 3rd pick, Chris Grier should not be allowed near a football team for as long as he's alive lol"

8683,2020-12-15 23:08:22,kdlgla,Najee Harris please
8684,2020-12-15 13:42:44,kdlgla,"Smith in the first = good. Idk anything about Patterson except that he had an insane game, but I'm guess we could get him later?"
8685,2020-12-15 21:39:23,kdlgla,"LB over RE all day. While having a stud DE pass rusher is cool, a NE style defense depends on the LBers to create pressure. Case and point: Jerome Baker on Sunday and AVG making plays. We need better LBers cause losing KVN and Elandon Roberts hammered this defense"
8686,2020-12-15 15:27:21,kdlgla,smith is not super fast late 4.4s mid 4.5s hes not a  burner he wins on his routes not speed ! JUST SIGN JOE THUNEY TO A 4 YEAR DEAL ! i think we should pick a burner someone that can take the top off of defenses ! sign allen robinson !
8687,2020-12-15 13:33:15,kdlgla,Doubt he falls to the second round at this rate

8735,2020-12-15 12:55:28,kdjerr,"Robinson, Golladay,  Ju-Ju, Godwin, Davis. Any of those and I'd be very happy. Though Mims is looking great himself so maybe someone like Ju-Ju or Godwin instead of a Golladay type."
8736,2020-12-15 12:41:05,kdjerr,"Tbh i like Corey Davis and to draft one at 33. Not going to break the bank and gives us a nice depth. I think he can get better in a bigger role, the Titans have a stacked group and Henry."
8737,2020-12-15 14:27:01,kdjerr,I've been on the allen robinson train all year. Dude absolutely balls. Every weekend he'll make amazing catches in the most boring games and just gets ignored. He's a stud who hates where he's playing and I'm convinced he's future jets wr1.
8738,2020-12-15 11:59:54,kdjerr,"I am hoping we get JuJu. Steelers habe moved on from him apparently, so he'll most likely hit FA, and he's just 24 yo."
8739,2020-12-15 11:30:41,kdjerr,">I’m sure a decent amount of these guys will resign with their current team.

It's fun to dream, but this is why i dont think any of it is great discussion until at least the season is over and you get an idea of whose going to walk and whose not. We're not even sure what the nfl is going to do with the cap yet; it could go down drastically or they could spread the loss our over the next 3, 5, or whatever years.

That said, i dont think getting in a bidding war for the ""best"" one of the bunch is a great idea. I'd rather see JD try to compliment whats already on the roster. If perriman walks, will fuller or sammy watkins could be those guys to take the top off the defense, though i dont think either walk. I'd rather re-sign perriman than sign john ross.

I think robinson, golladay, and godwin wont be worth the price and/or we get outbid by a more competitive team that entice's them. Yea, trevor is a great draw, but so is a winning team or an already successful quarterback. 

AJ green is either playing for a contender or retiring. He's toast. I'm not sure about TY or marvin jones, but thise two are getting up there also.

Juju and corey davis i'd be fine with as long as the contract is reasonable. Davis has come on strong in stretches this year. Both are functional wide receivers. 

Idk enough about moore to make an assessment. All i hear about is DK and Lockette out of Seattle. 

Treadwell, nah."
8740,2020-12-15 14:13:54,kdjerr,Allen Robinson or juju would be amazing
8741,2020-12-15 15:07:36,kdjerr,"Kenny Golladay would be nice. Him, Mims, Crowder and I think that Berrios under the right coach could be a nice surprise. Keep the Tight Ends we have, maybe draft another. I blame coaching for the tight end play this season."
8742,2020-12-15 13:06:15,kdjerr,"The only one I'd seriously look at is Ju-Ju. He's got great size, and he has a good, positive personality. And he's young. He makes a lot of $ on the side with endorsements and his social media, so NY would be a smart landing spot for him. This should be a winning team in the near future, and I'm sure he wouldn't want to leave Pittsburgh, but he'd be a good fit here and bring something the team doesn't currently have - character and personality."
8743,2020-12-15 14:28:53,kdjerr,Kenny or Allen Robinson. You want someone in their prime. Take a shot at Godwin and Juju as well.
8744,2020-12-15 17:38:38,kdjerr,"Maybe this ages poorly and I'm wrong, but I feel like we just aren't going to have the level of investment in WR that many are hyping up and a lot of people are going to be disappointed. We have the cap and the resources to address WR and will have a rookie QB whose growth we'll be responsible for, but we also still have a shell of a team that needs pieces everywhere. Our OL still needs 4 long-term pieces, we need an NFL-caliber edge rush, and our secondary is mostly miserable. At this point, WR is ""fine"" and we can get away with not spending premium capital on someone. A free agent to replace Perriman and a 3rd round WR can round out an uninspiring but serviceable corps. We *have* the money to spend, but I think addressing premium positions with numerous value-based shots and maintaining cap flexibility is going to be our MO. That isn't to say we don't address WR in the future, but I think we build our foundation first and foremost."
8745,2020-12-15 14:13:08,kdjerr,"A guy you missed, who I think would fit really well with our current group, and would not sign at an extroardinary price is Curtis Samuel. He's smaller but super explosive, could fit in as a deep threat / gadget weapon next to Mims the big target and Crowder getting open in the slot. You can scheme gimmicky stuff with him in the backfield and add wrinkle to the offense we haven't had in years. 

Not sure if Carolina resigns him with DJ Moore and Robby there already..."
8746,2020-12-15 13:42:57,kdjerr,Didn't watkins sign a new deal after the Superbowl?
8747,2020-12-15 18:14:05,kdjerr,"Ju-Ju is really good but probably gonna be too expensive. ARob is an absolute monster but with his history of playing on terrible teams with terrible QBs I feel as if he’d rather go to a contender which you couldn’t really blame him for. 

Golladay is extremely underrated I’m all for signing him."
8748,2020-12-15 20:39:20,kdjerr,"The guy here to make a push for is Golladay if DET lets him walk. Some popular Wrs that you guys are interested in simply wont work
A Rob- wont come to us, wants to play for a contender understandably will be looking at places like greenbay instead of NY 
JuJu- great young player but overall unnecessary when crowder will give us about 70% of his production for way cheaper. crowder is really really good and with the right qb could put up similar numbers 
Goodwin- most likely will get resigned but if not great option
Davis- although hes a good option he is more of a consolation prize. not as good as wrs listed above 
marvin jones- if DET lets him walk hes an OK option but age doesnt fit with out rebuild time table
most other options on the list either fall in the regressing wr who will probably want to play for a contender, or just a consolation prize that would be a fine option but not a main target
if DET lets galladay walk he should be the main target (assuming a rob is 100% out) he makes some incredible catches and could play well next to mims. 
also if we do land one of these big names it’s important we look at other positions in the draft. the core of a big name FA/mims/crowder/periman is actually not bad for the new QB. O line, edge, CB in a much worse spot"
8749,2020-12-15 23:46:48,kdjerr,"Watkins and Cory Davis please.  We need 2 because 1 is none. And Mims can lean from both of them, or sign a few of them and see who works out, and then we can focus on other positions in the draft like TE and pick N Harris in the 3rd."
8750,2020-12-15 11:26:38,kdjerr,Ill take one allen Robinson and will fuller please
8751,2020-12-15 14:23:08,kdjerr,"well really the list of FA is Fuller, Kenny G, Arob, juju, godwin, Corey Davis, because everyone else is too old or a scrub. It's pretty clear fuller isn't going to sign with us already. Fuller to GB seems like a lock already.

If the guy people want so bad is Corey Davis, then we are better off just not cutting crowder and drafting someone. Don't see him worth paying in a rebuild unless it's cheap.

If we are trying to sign someone, juju makes the most sense if we cut crowder and draft an outside WR. Him being 24 is the most enticing. Godwin is the same age (I'd love if we signed him) but I expect him to ask for too much. I love Kenny G but he's too much of a duplicate mims. Honestly, A Rob is the best fit but I would like that signing the least cause he's almost 28 and you know he's a temporary solution. I see a WR in the draft for sure, so maybe we retain crowder and sign no one??"
8752,2020-12-15 12:13:23,kdjerr,[deleted]
8753,2020-12-15 12:16:40,kdjerr,"I see some big names, some people who are washed up and others who are not as good as advertised. Let's hope the Jets don't over pay for people on ttge last 2 groups."
8754,2020-12-15 14:41:16,kdjerr,Honestly I’d love Marvin or Kenny. I feel like Allen Robinson is a pipe dream. Well prolly end up with Corey Davis 😶
8755,2020-12-15 15:01:23,kdjerr,"Robinson, Golladay, Godwin and maybe JuJu are in a tier above the rest. I’d be content with going after a tier 2 guy and then spending our late 1st/2nd on a WR

A WR unit of Corey Davis, Mims, Crowder and Rondale Moore is extremely solid"
8756,2020-12-15 15:26:11,kdjerr,"A good number of those guys shouldn’t even be considered for either being too old, injury prone, or just not very good.

If we can get Godwin, Juju, or ARob, that is ideal. Golladay and Corey Davis would be 2nd priority. Quite frankly, I wouldn’t consider any others."
8757,2020-12-15 15:29:05,kdjerr,"I'd  take anyone of them preferenced by
 Age .younger the better. It takes awhile to get on track for a wideout. Then we don't have to reach for a draft pick. Then maybe go qb,oline,edge"
8758,2020-12-15 15:34:37,kdjerr,If they for some reason let Fuller Walk...sign him now. Great guy to take the top off defenses. Also a huge fan of Golladay
8759,2020-12-15 15:57:03,kdjerr,"I would love to get Robinson if we could. Aside from him, I'd like to get Godwin and that's about it. Alongside with drafting one with 65/88."
8760,2020-12-15 16:35:00,kdjerr,Robinson or Godwin pretty convincingly for me. Prefer Godwin but would be thrilled with either or.
8761,2020-12-15 16:35:32,kdjerr,"Anyone arguing that it’s a bad idea to pay through the nose for the top FA WR should see: Darnold, Sam - and 3 years of excuses because of the franchise’s inability to get him talent.

Pay Allen Robinson 10% more than any other team is offering for Trevor’s sake."
8762,2020-12-15 16:50:25,kdjerr,Laquon Treadwell does not belong on this list lmao
8763,2020-12-15 16:59:10,kdjerr,A-Rob please. Him and Joe Thuney and the draft is perfect. Well ig you could add Simmons to the mix and I’d be happy. If we’re talking wideouts tho Allen Robinson is definitely the #1 choice.
8764,2020-12-15 17:17:12,kdjerr,"Receiver, corner, edge, offensive line, we should be able to get at least 2 of those taken care of through free agency and use the draft for the rest."
8765,2020-12-15 17:25:30,kdjerr,should sign 2-3 off that list. going to need it to help whoever the qb is next year.
8766,2020-12-15 18:05:08,kdjerr,If we strike out on the top guys I'd like to grab both Marcin jones and curtis samuel.
8767,2020-12-15 18:15:57,kdjerr,"Realistic: Hilton and Fuller

Prayer: Golladay and Juju"
8768,2020-12-15 18:26:33,kdjerr,Godwin or Davis please
8769,2020-12-15 20:31:39,kdjerr,The only candidates should be Godwin and JuJu because they are still young enough that they will be hitting their prime when the team might actually be competitive.
8770,2020-12-15 23:44:17,kdjerr,LaQuon Treadwell will solve nothing
8771,2020-12-16 11:58:52,kdjerr,"Godwin, Davis, Samuel, Juju in that order. 

Godwin - 24 years old (February 1996)


Best combination of youth+talent on this list. Was banged up plus the addition of Brown Gronk and Miller hurt his stats this year but the guy is a beast (my second favorite team has been the bucs for a while now so i watch most of their games).


Davis - 25 years old (January 1995)


Had mariota throwing to him in a run first offense so it took him a while to come into his own but hes looked great this year. The talents always been there.


Samuel - 24 years old (August 1996)


Arguably the most talented wr with the least to show for it so its a bit of a gamble so he'll be a cheaper option BUT hes absolutely talented. Has blazing speed and looks like a rb with the ball in his hands (he was one in college). Last year his catchable ball percentage was nearly last in the league with kyle allen throwing to him. Hes had a very productive year in 2020 albeit with more targets to throw to in that offense with the addition of robby and having dj moore.


Juju - 24 years old (November 1996)


He was overtaken this year by diontae johnson but hes obviously talented. Hes had a 900 yard season and a 1400 yard season. He'll come cheaper and he'll be around for a while.


Obviously im prioritizing youth here and my reasoning is because i want whoever our qb is to grow and learn with a talented wr group over the years. It may take us 2-3 years to be actual superbowl contenders. 

Allen Robinson/Kenny Golladay-

 id be ok with arob or Golladay because of what theyve done in terrible situations but theyd both be 30 in 3 years. Both represent the best wrs on this list. They would be great additions to a team that can win it all in 2021/2022. Thats not us

Marvin Jones/Aj Green/TY Hilton - ancient.

David Moore/John Ross - stink

Sammy Watkins/Laquan Treadwell - totally average and sammy getting old fast

Will Fuller - very talented wr if healthy and thats a big IF also 26 years old"
8772,2020-12-16 16:56:10,kdjerr,"Agreed along with other positions like OLB, Corner, and Guard in particular"
8773,2020-12-17 18:45:09,kdjerr,Great list! If we could sign someone like Laquon treadwell I really think it could change the trajectory of our franchise
8774,2020-12-15 13:37:20,kdjerr,Juju or watkins would be the most likely out of this list to come to the jets. They would be a great addition to Mims.
8775,2020-12-15 14:34:25,kdjerr,"John Ross is hitting the market? He's certainly worth looking in on. 

I'd be actually shocked if Indianapolis doesn't resign TY Hilton. Same goes for Pittsburgh with Ju-Ju and Detroit with Golladay. Otherwise though, yes to any three of them. 

I'll take Chris Godwin, Allen Robinson, and David Moore too. 

I think Green is outstanding but someone else said it best, he's going ring hunting. I don't think he'd sign here otherwise least J.D. sells him fallacy. Fuller, Davis, and Treadwell I'd also pass on."
8776,2020-12-15 15:14:47,kdjerr,"You guys are seriously underrating John Ross. Idk what his deal is now, but that kid has some talent. He’s young and would come cheap. They should consider him."
8777,2020-12-15 15:33:29,kdjerr,"Someone should shake loose from dallas, cap issues"
8778,2020-12-15 19:30:56,kdjerr,"I saw someone else say the “need two good WRs instead of one great one” argument. I agree with it generally. Or I did. Look at the difference Hopkins made in Houston. To turn this dumpster fire around you need THREE great recievers, not two. Go get me Juju or Robinson and draft another. Need to make matchup issues."
8779,2020-12-15 17:24:03,kdjerr,I really want Fuller.
8780,2020-12-15 17:40:47,kdjerr,AJ Green will be on the Chiefs next year if they lose Watkins
8781,2020-12-15 19:09:14,kdjerr,"I want John Ross and Curtis Samuel, two good receivers instead of one great one, will help stretch the field further along with Mims, Crowder, and Perriman. It’ll be a ton of hard to cover receivers."
8782,2020-12-15 16:59:09,kdjerr,"Fuck it, gimme Golladay and let’s build an actual fucking force of an offense"
8783,2020-12-15 23:03:13,kdjerr,I think if ARob hits the market you have to give him what he wants. He is in that first tier of receiver but doesn’t get recognition because he played with Bortles and Trubisky. But I think your list accurately reflects the only ones that should be targeted from OP’s list
8784,2020-12-16 13:14:08,kdjerr,That's my list as well.
8785,2020-12-15 12:58:49,kdjerr,"I think if they manage to sign someone like Davis, they wouldn't even need to draft one. Davis, Perriman, Mims, Crowder (assuming they're kept that is). Then they could go QB, CB, OL with their first three picks. Would round out the team better than adding another WR to that list."
8786,2020-12-16 00:08:18,kdjerr,Davis is gonna get paid. At the bare minimum he gets what Robby got
8787,2020-12-15 17:19:21,kdjerr,"Only issue is that he keeps playing on bad teams and he clearly doesn’t like it. Maybe after this season he’s had enough and wants to go to a contender to make himself more well known and get the credit he deserves as an elite WR. I wouldn’t blame him for not wanting to come to a team that just went 0-16 (hopefully) after just playing with Bortles, Trubisly, and Foles for the past few years.

He is by far and away my favorite option of all the WRs this year though"
8788,2020-12-15 14:36:30,kdjerr,Juju or Robinson have been my hopes for people to sign. I know Juju has been getting it a bit for the TikTok he did on the Bills logo but if thats the stupid stuff he does and is into its far better than some WRs out there.
8789,2020-12-15 12:42:04,kdjerr,Juju or Corey Davis should be the top 2 targets.
8790,2020-12-15 15:36:35,kdjerr,Not a fan of Juju tbh. Feel like there are much better and more proven options at WR
8791,2020-12-15 13:18:56,kdjerr,"Have they, though? The first half of the season seemed that way but I thought they came around and have started utilizing him more. There will be games where they won't go with him but otherwise he is still an important piece in their offense."
8792,2020-12-15 15:05:00,kdjerr,He’s their only WR who can catch and the fans love him. I’d be surprised but not shocked to see him enter FA
8793,2020-12-15 17:22:29,kdjerr,"Juju is not good and is also the cringiest player in the nfl, extremely hard pass."
8794,2020-12-15 12:21:36,kdjerr,"I doubt Juju's contract is going to be reasonable. Some of the big guys (Julio, MThomas) are in the \~$18M, that next tier around $16M is Theilin, Hopkins and Evans. I think fair market value would be around $13M which would put him around Diggs, Laundry, Adams. Even this might be steep for someone with questions being the #1 WR, not sure JD would do that."
8795,2020-12-15 15:42:52,kdjerr,"Fully with you across the board. This is also a silly topic to discuss before extensions and cuts.  

Additionally I’m willing pass on WRs who ONLY want to come here because of $. We’ve been burned so many times on that before. I’d rather roll over cap and pay out our own guys here. 

This team is so bad up and down that I’d rather use FA to fill out the middle and bottom of the roster to make rookies compete harder for starting spots and put less pressure on incoming low draft capital picks. That will also give JD more flexibility on draft day to go BPA vs needs based drafting.

The top of the roster will blossom over time and we already have some good foundational pieces. 

Mims, Permian, Crowder and a 2nd round WR in a deep class will be solid weapons on their own. We won’t need to break the bank on WR. I really think fans want to be excited this offseason to put a bandaid on a terrible season but I’m thinking long term personally."
8796,2020-12-15 15:40:18,kdjerr,"I love ARob and I’d probably pay him more than reasonable, but I can’t see him wanting to play for a team that always loses. He seems miserable in Chicago and he kinda did in Jax. As much as I would love him, I think he’s go to somewhere like the Ravens or maybe Texans"
8797,2020-12-15 16:57:21,kdjerr,"I like JuJu too, but he’d really be the “only” one you’d look at? You wouldn’t even consider Golladay, Godwin, Corey Davis, who are all 4 years in as well? Or Robinson who’s a few years older but is easily the best WR on this list? What about Fuller? JuJu is probably like the 5th best player on this list I’m not sure why he’s the ONLY one you’d consider. We can’t leave Lawrence or Fields with Perriman as the #2 guy"
8798,2020-12-15 14:21:55,kdjerr,Agreed. He’d be a superstar here and has a great attitude
8799,2020-12-15 17:53:33,kdjerr,"While I agree with all you've said, as a Steelers fan, I'd caution that his antics are a bit immature and might cause a young, building team to lose focus moreso than signing a more professional vet would. Just my boomer logic two cents though"
8800,2020-12-15 17:42:39,kdjerr,"Samuel would be a great get. I understand that getting a real-deal WR1 would be sick, but his likely value and absolute versatility are major assets that we could take advantage of. He's not a WR1 by any means, but he's a weapon teams will need to account for. I'm in"
8801,2020-12-15 14:27:59,kdjerr,Good call I meant to add him and I knew I was forgetting someone!!! I’ll add him to the list!
8802,2020-12-15 22:16:40,kdjerr,I really like Curtis Samuel but lots of his production this year has been from scheme and the absence of CMC. If CMC is there he doesn’t get those backfield carries and doesn’t see the same targets. I think this year was an anomaly
8803,2020-12-15 14:13:29,kdjerr,It was a one year deal after the SB win.
8804,2020-12-15 15:41:15,kdjerr,The dude who tore up the XFL with the Roughnecks?
8805,2020-12-16 00:41:20,kdjerr,"I'm all for taking flyers on guys who had success in other leagues, but it doesn't always translate. For example the Packers signed 27 year old Reggie Begelton before this year. In the FCS he had 227 catches for 2435 yards and 20 TDs.  Then he went to the CFL, and across his first 2 years he had injuries and in 16 combined games had 47 catches for 792 yards and 2 TDs. Then in 2019 he's healthy and has *102 catches for 1444 yards and 10 TDs.* He's 6'0 200lbs. He's been active for 1 game and logged 2 offensive snaps with 0 targets, spending the rest of the year on the practice squad. And the Packers have had injuries at WR this year and he couldn't get on the field.

So ya, the potential is there, but when you sign a guy from another league you should have juuuust about zero expectations."
8806,2020-12-15 15:33:41,kdjerr,"I’d take Corey Davis over a to be 31 year old Marvin Jones 10/10 times. Hell, Jones’ only good season was back in ‘17. I’m really confused why you’d love a 32 year old receiver who has gone over 1000 yards just once in his career."
8807,2020-12-15 20:23:38,kdjerr,"I’d be fine with that too, my only gripe is that it might be hard to develop a rookie WR if they have to be 4th on the depth chart all year. After next season maybe Crowder walks and that rookie can step into a top 3 role, but it’d have to be someone who’s comfortable in the slot, because Mims plays outside. If we sign either Godwin or JuJu, it would give us more flexibility in that regard because they both can play slot and outside"
8808,2020-12-15 20:51:03,kdjerr,"Fuller has serious injury problems... hammies made of parchment paper and for as fast as he is, that’s not going away anytime soon 
Acls you can come back from, hamstrings are just one of those nagging injuries that just lingers around forever"
8809,2020-12-15 17:54:29,kdjerr,"Sam Darnold also had a league-worst OL for his entire career, horrible coaching, and was a development-needy QB that didn't get the kinks worked out of his game. We need WR talent, but we still need to build everything else, especially the positions where you need premium investment to get premium results. I want to land a great WR sooner or later, but I don't think this is the year. Fix the trenches this year with some investment into skill positions and then lock in a good skill position group the following year"
8810,2020-12-15 20:28:27,kdjerr,theres no way we sign 3 off this list
8811,2020-12-15 15:30:21,kdjerr,"Why is Ross worth looking at? He’s been an utter bust. He was only drafted that high because he ran fast. That’s it. Wildly over drafted, perpetually injured, and just not good at football.

Green outstanding? Are you living in 2015?! When was the last time he was actually good? Certainly not this year. Not last year either. We should want no part in him."
8812,2020-12-15 15:35:58,kdjerr,"Does he? Ross was wildly overdrafted because he ran fast. He had no business going that high. His “talent” hasn’t translated to the NFL as he has been buried in their depth chart. He also can’t stay healthy. Ross just has not shown he is a good receiver. If we want someone who can run fast, we should sign Samuel instead."
8813,2020-12-15 20:25:15,kdjerr,"Cooper just signed a big deal, Lamb is a rookie so has 3 more years after this one and Gallup still has another year on his rookie deal. None of them are shaking loose except Gallup after next season, which we shouldn’t wait for"
8814,2020-12-15 22:13:22,kdjerr,Dallas is 178m for 2021 that's 3m over without dak. Unless someone takes a cheap deal at qb.dak at 35m don't fit.maybe Cooper is worth a call
8815,2020-12-16 14:30:04,kdjerr,I’d like to see that
8816,2020-12-15 20:18:18,kdjerr,"Since when does John Ross qualify as a good receiver? Also, I wouldn’t consider Perriman “hard to cover.” We need an Alpha across from Mims if we really wanna take a leap to be one of the top offenses, not a bunch of so-so receivers that can’t win 1 on 1"
8817,2020-12-15 23:45:35,kdjerr,We have so much cap and a rookie QB contract that you should give Arob the bank
8818,2020-12-15 15:11:09,kdjerr,"No this is how we get into the same issue. We need to saturate the weapons for our new qb. Perriman if re-signed is always hurt. Crowder and Mims have been hurt multiple times this year. If we get a guy like Davis who doesn't even scare defenses we'd still be trying to beat number 1 corners with perriman or Mims? No.


We have crowder and Mims with talent. Sign a real wr that defenses have to care about (Robinson, juju, Watkins) and ALSO draft another one in the first round. That way we are more insured for injury while also fielding a great wr unit for a developing quarterback. Don't forget we have ZERO tight ends. 

We'll have plenty of picks/money to use on interior line too. 


We just went through this shit with Sanchez and darnold. 1-2 injuries and Lawrence /Fields are throwing to corey Davis and Berrios? Gross. No."
8819,2020-12-15 23:03:21,kdjerr,"You need depth at that position. Especially in 4/5 WR sets. Players are going to he dinged up throughout the season. Cannot risk rolling out your #5 and #6 as starters. 

My ideal depth chart is :

#1FA signing 
#2 Mims
Slots Crowder and Berrios 
Depth
2nd/3rd round Rookie 
Couple young special teamers rounding it out."
8820,2020-12-15 14:47:46,kdjerr,"Perriman only signed a 1 year deal, so that's assuming they re-sign him."
8821,2020-12-16 00:16:02,kdjerr,That's half of what the top guys are gonna get. I think he's worth the 13-15 million per range.
8822,2020-12-15 18:56:35,kdjerr,Dang. That's a pretty good point I hadn't considered. I just want it so bad I believe the universe will give in.
8823,2020-12-15 15:53:00,kdjerr,I'd honestly rather keep Crowder in the slot. He's proven to be good and we should reward good play if we want to attract FAs in JDs Jets. Robinson or Godwin for me.
8824,2020-12-15 18:34:08,kdjerr,I don’t mind a guy who disrespects the bills. Fuck the bills.
8825,2020-12-15 14:50:28,kdjerr,Allen Robinson easily should be the #1 target.
8826,2020-12-15 17:19:37,kdjerr,"Sure, other guys have played on a high level for much longer. But we are rebuilding and JuJu has only just turned 24. He's still s young, that's a major reason why I'm so high on getting him and not someone like Jones or Robinson"
8827,2020-12-15 13:49:59,kdjerr,"They still have Diontae and Claypool, if Juju wants to get paid like a #1 they could just roll with the two young productive guys they already have. And with their track record there's a good chance they can draft a guy in the 3rd-4th round who ends up contributing."
8828,2020-12-15 14:38:04,kdjerr,Theyre utilizing him more because Claypool emerged and they moved him back to the slot
8829,2020-12-15 17:15:53,kdjerr,"Claypool is real imo though, and Johnson doesn't seem to be bad either."
8830,2020-12-15 18:06:56,kdjerr,Why do you think he's garbage?
8831,2020-12-15 14:16:56,kdjerr,"Yea, i could see him getting overpriced. Idk the steelers cap situation either, though. Ben's not going to be around forever and they might want to keep some stability for Ben's heir.

I dont think it's worth getting caught up on ""True #1 receiver."" Half the people saying it dont even agree on the definition (is it an X receiver? High volume receiver? Or a guy who can play anywhere?). I think this is one of the most overrated parts of building a successful team. I'd rather have 3 guys that can help a qb spread the ball around than 1 guy who draws doubles."
8832,2020-12-15 19:46:23,kdjerr,"I disagree that he's the 5th best guy on that list. He's not the top guy, no, but he brings more, imo. More energy, a good attitude (from what I've seen), and he'd be coming from a winning organization, so he'd have lots to pass on. And he'll run guys over when he has to, which I love."
8833,2020-12-15 19:44:06,kdjerr,"My wife's a huge Steelers fan, loves him. We're in our mid 40's, so not quite boomers, but I can't say we've really seen any immature antics. But we also don't live in Pittsburgh either!"
8834,2020-12-15 14:15:39,kdjerr,Ah...so we're both right then
8835,2020-12-16 03:04:21,kdjerr,[deleted]
8836,2020-12-15 21:17:41,kdjerr,🍯🍯🍯
8837,2020-12-15 21:36:28,kdjerr,"My logic is, adding these two is enough to stretch the field, also allows us to move money towards any defensive pieces."
8838,2020-12-15 15:25:03,kdjerr,"Of course they need to saturate the new QB with weapons. But if they sign one of those good free agent WR’s and have a group of Robinson, Perriman, Mims, Crowder that is a way better group than Darnold ever had, way better. I said Davis because I was agreeing with the guy above but I would prefer Robinson, or Ju-Ju above him.

I’m not against drafting another WR at all, I’m just saying, we know how important oline is and you say we’re 1-2 injuries off of having no receivers to throw to. We’re also one Becton injury from having a wet paper bag oline for the new QB.

We’ve also just sat through Darnold’s entire Jets career watching him flounder for his life play in play out. Oline first dude."
8839,2020-12-15 23:50:22,kdjerr,"Yeah you’re right, I should have clarified what I meant before. I think I’d much rather go with a star FA like Robinson who has experience and is ready for Lawrence/Fields. Then maybe they could draft a receiver in the 3rd or 4th as depth, instead of drafting a WR in the 1st when we took Mims early last year. 

I really want them to invest in this OL. I’m sure Douglas will, but after what’s happened with Darnold it has to happen."
8840,2020-12-15 15:11:18,kdjerr,He’s shown flashes but I think they move on. Injury prone and inconsistent
8841,2020-12-15 21:31:32,kdjerr,"Hopefully if we get Trevor and a good coach that will be enough to draw talent here. But if I’m being honest, I see to many long term deals happening next season because of the lower cap space. I fear players will just sigh one year deals until we know the cap will go up again."
8842,2020-12-15 18:21:56,kdjerr,"Fair point, Crowder has been nothing but great for the team despite how bad its been."
8843,2020-12-15 19:36:49,kdjerr,"(Godwin) Idk how he’s been this year, but his catch percentage at the beginning of the year was just slightly lower than L Fitz. Godwin is a beast"
8844,2020-12-15 22:59:23,kdjerr,Allen Robinson going to be the most expensive and is in his late 20s. I'll prefer Juju or Davis. Both can be paired with TLaw for the next 4-5 years. I also don't see a guy that had QB troubles his entire career coming to a team that doesn't have a QB yet (FA before draft).
8845,2020-12-15 15:06:45,kdjerr,"He’ll probably be the most expensive and he’s had minor attitude issues but yeah, he is very good"
8846,2020-12-15 16:00:28,kdjerr,"Why would Robinson go to a 0-1 win team when he has different suitors that will give him similar money? I like Robinson but if you think we can get him, your expectations are a bit too high.

Plus, JD is not Macc, he doesn’t wanna “win” free agency by overpaying high priced players who has little desire to perform with the Jets.

Plus, like you said Robinson has minor attitude issues. You know who also had minor attitude issues? Le’Veon. And that flopped on our faces"
8847,2020-12-15 18:22:06,kdjerr,I’d rather take someone like Golladay or Fuller if we can’t get an established guy like ARob.
8848,2020-12-15 18:07:26,kdjerr,"I said he’s not good, didn’t say he’s garbage. Average WR. Only plays the slot."
8849,2020-12-15 15:10:14,kdjerr,Using #1 WR and an X wr interchangeably is the hill I will die on. And I think Mims is capable of being our true X so a guy like Juju would be a fine signing imo
8850,2020-12-15 20:05:12,kdjerr,"Okay, sure, if you like JuJu more than the rest on that list, I get that. But he’s really the ONLY one you’d even consider? That’s just silly. Robinson, Godwin and Golladay are 100% better receivers than him, and you could make an argument for Fuller too. Again, if you like JuJu more than the rest, that’s fine, but to say he’s the ONLY one you’d want is just stupid"
8851,2020-12-16 22:40:24,kdjerr,Yes
8852,2020-12-15 21:36:51,kdjerr,"Soooo, any reason why you like the inferior player Jones over the superior player Davis?"
8853,2020-12-15 21:42:35,kdjerr,Adding both of them will probably cost the same as one stud receiver anyway. This logic is pretty flawed IMO. There’s a reason John Ross doesn’t even play on the Bengals
8854,2020-12-15 15:28:43,kdjerr,"I see oline injuries as a bit more rare, but yeah our second first pick and our second round pick are so close I wouldn't mind going bpa between interior oline and wr."
8855,2020-12-16 00:18:15,kdjerr,The oline class this year is pretty meh. I think they can someone okay at Seattle's pick. It all depends on where the spend in Free Agency. The defense has no one under contract.
8856,2020-12-15 15:50:10,kdjerr,"I can see Robinson declining to play here due to wanting to be on a contender. He has spent his career playing for garbage teams, doubt he wants to join another rebuilding team."
8857,2020-12-15 16:27:34,kdjerr,LeVeon had no attitude issues here. I didn't say anything about ARob having attitude issues. We have the 2nd most cap space and need to put talent around Lawrence/Fields. Him and maybe Godwin are the only true WR1s available.
8858,2020-12-15 16:54:18,kdjerr,"“Like you said, Robinson has minor attitude issues” he never said this the fuck are u talking about lol. And Robinson doesn’t have attitude issues that’s dumb and neither did Bell. Bell didn’t work out here because Gase is a complete moron and one of the worst coaches of all time, he had 0 attitude issues here

Robinson should absolutely be our #1 target. We have the money for it and we need weapons to put around our young QB. JD understands that and he’s not just gonna cheap out on every single position"
8859,2020-12-15 23:39:02,kdjerr,Fuller is always hurt.
8860,2020-12-15 18:17:02,kdjerr,I mean he's 6'1 and 215lbs. Surely he could play outside if needed
8861,2020-12-15 16:49:56,kdjerr,"If someone says #1 my first thought it targets. If youre the #1 read on a majority of plays you could be coming out the backfield and i dont care, youre the #1 receiver. I mean, jerry rice was a quintessential flanker/Z and he's the greatest wr of all time. That said, guys are limited to just one spot unless they physically cant do all of them or theyre too dense to grasp the full playbook."
8862,2020-12-16 02:15:26,kdjerr,"At this stage, yes. Mims is the real deal imo. If Perriman sticks around, then I'd go for Ju-Ju over the rest of those guys for the reasons I mentioned above. You want to build a team, not just a collection of guys who happen to be available.

Are some of those guys better receivers than Ju-Ju? Yes. But I think Ju-Ju would bring more *over all* to this Jets team, at this moment. He's much much better than his 2019 and 2020 numbers have shown, and if he gets the chance to be a 1-2 punch with a guy like Mims and have T-Law throwing to him, he'll be back to 2018 no problem.

I wouldn't be upset at the other guys you listed at all, but it's Ju-Ju I'd target more than the rest."
8863,2020-12-15 15:34:05,kdjerr,"Yeah I can agree with that for sure, nice to have the extra picks this year!"
8864,2020-12-15 19:34:43,kdjerr,This. Robinson wants to win now. He’ll go to a team like the Dolphins or Ravens who are already playoff worthy even without much WR depth.
8865,2020-12-15 19:28:10,kdjerr,Really? Complained that he wasn't getting enough practice reps when Gase said he was banged up and then was promptly side lined a few days with the same injury.
8866,2020-12-15 16:30:11,kdjerr,"Someone else in the thread said it. I just feel as if, if the team goes 0-16, that significantly lowers the chances of getting a wideout of A-Rob’s caliber when other teams will give him as much just not as more.

Plus, JD is a bit different. If this was Macc, he probably would’ve given A-Rob 5 years 130. JD prefers to make low-risk signings like he did in the past free agency so we can preserve cap space."
8867,2020-12-15 18:22:57,kdjerr,there's more to playing outside than just size
8868,2020-12-16 02:51:13,kdjerr,"Again, if you like JuJu more than the rest I get that. But to say JuJu is the only one we should be targeting and guys like Robinson and Golladay are “just a collection of guys who happen to be available” is ridiculous. These are bonafide Alpha WRs, something JuJu has never proven he can be, whereas Robinson, for example, has done it year after year after year"
8869,2020-12-15 19:45:41,kdjerr,Obviously but are we really going to argue he lacks the ability to play outside well?

And yes, at this stage in the Jets rebuild (or whatever this mess is), it is a collection of guys who are, or could be, available this offseason and I don't think getting the top guy *at this position* is all that pressing. I don't think it's worth it to get into a bidding war for those guys. The best WR's available this year shouldn't be this current team's priority.

I don't think now is the time to bring in an ""alpha"" WR. 2022's FA crop isn't deep, but there's D Adams, Lockett and the Sun God potentially available, not to mention the draft where the Jets have a lot of picks.

**MY** opinion is to bring in a guy like Ju-Ju this offseason, and worry about the dozen other positions this team needs. On offense, I'd be looking more at TE than WR this offseason. The reason I like Ju-Ju so much is that he's like a TE/WR hybrid, a big body that will go through guys."

8875,2020-12-15 13:13:45,kdjdc4,"I would start by checking in with your grandmother (the one who has a similar name to the one on the package) just in case. This definitely sounds like it could be from a confused elderly person who isn’t taking care of themselves. 

I would google the names listed on the packaging and see if you can find the person’s identity. 

I wouldn’t worry.. it sounds like a big mishap not something malicious. But always good to throw it out especially since it was stinky."
8876,2020-12-15 10:59:45,kdjdc4,"Maybe they really just mistaken you with somebody else? I think you should check her on for example Facebook, and see if the state the package's been sent from matches up with some ""Mary Smith"" on Facebook. Though the first thing that pops up when you google her is a deacesed psychologist, but you should check that.  

> I worry that this is somehow an extension of that  

Maybe you should contact the police?"
8877,2020-12-15 13:30:00,kdjdc4,"My theory may be very very wrong, so I apologize in advance if it seems a bit insensitive.

Is your grandma still alive and maybe having a lapse in memory issue?"
8878,2020-12-15 14:38:51,kdjdc4,"It sounds like it was lost in shipping and got misdirected to you, based on the similarity of your name. Like others recommended, I would see if someone of those names lives near you or whatever state it came from. Try a zaba search for an elderly person with that name?

Before my grandmother passed, she'd send me random care packages like this. They'd stink heavily of her horrible laundry detergent, and she'd pack food (brownies, cookies, etc.) in slices of white bread to keep them from going stale. And she'd send me random decorations or toys of mine she found. I could see those packages ending up in someone else's hands and they're like ""WTF??""

This makes me miss my grandmother, though. :("

And even if he doesnt get better from here on out (Which is highly unlikely!) Hes still a solid center that can start on any team! Even if he doesnt play like a superstar right now! Why the fuck would we trqde our young talent thats still growing for an old ass dude! That is going to decline soon! Man you definitely need to delete this post before you get shitted on

You want to trade a 3rd year center that made a gigantic leap on the defensive end who is efficient as hell on offense because he isn’t drawing fouls or dominating in the paint in a PRESEASON GAME. That’s absurd and I don’t take you seriously because of it.

Smith squad goggles with the cylindrical lenses are one of the cheaper options. My personal recommendation, go with something like the dragon alliance d2. Around $40 on ebay since they got discontinued. Buy 2 for the price of 1. U basically get 4 lenses."
8960,2020-12-15 17:14:56,kddd0h,"I know this doesn’t help now, but I just ordered a pair of Smith I/O Mags. FOV is big for me. I won’t be able to open them until Christmas, but I’ll track this post back down when I get to try them on and let you know what I think about them."
8961,2020-12-21 05:09:05,kddd0h,I used to be a smith fan line everybody else here. I had a pair of i/os that were great and then a pair of io7s that were OK but the face foam deteriorated after only 2 seasons. I bought a pair of squads and they are TERRIBLE fogging constantly. Replaced them with Oakley line miners and they have never fogged and honestly the prizm lenses seem higher quality then chroma pop. Strongly recommend the line miners.
8962,2020-12-15 04:05:49,kddd0h,I've got a pair of POC Fovea that I think have a better field of view then my Smith i/o. They aren't the easiest to swap lenes with and they fit a little low on my nose with my helmet. The clarity feels top notch.
8963,2020-12-15 03:34:58,kddcc3,To answer your first question on whether you should apply....100% apply .  A 3.7/3.8 at the  UofT  is very good. Imo you have a solid chance at the schools you are applying to . The LOR is a tricky one though if you feel like you have a good connection with your prof then go ahead and send the letter. My question is though have you asked any other professors to write you a LOR besides him?
8964,2020-12-15 15:32:45,kddcc3,hey found another u of t student trying to transfer out of this place lol
8965,2020-12-15 22:53:52,kddcc3,"Thank you for the reassurance, I think the final and my subsequent mark just really freaked me out. I usually attended calculus office hours and tried to ask good questions about the course. I was usually one of only 2-3 other people that showed up so I think he knows me pretty well. Do you think not having a stellar grade to show for the course itself would make my LOR have less “value”? I have also asked my psychology professor, which is a course I’m doing extremely well in and one that I’ve gone to almost every office hour for. The professor also knows me pretty well for this course."
8966,2020-12-15 22:54:33,kddcc3,"Haha, I’m at UTSC, what about you?"
8967,2021-02-07 11:07:32,kddcc3,Lol same
8968,2020-12-18 03:58:45,kddcc3,The grade won't have a significant impact on the value of the LOR. The purpose of a LOR is to give incite on a students work ethic. It's so the person who reads your application knows what kind of student you are. From what you have described you seem to be an extremely hard working and determined student. You've got nothing to worry about. I'm sure you will get accepted to at least one or more of the schools you are applying to.

I’m not 100% sure but I think Berdan primers are slightly larger than their Boxer equivalents so that’s why they won’t fit. Even if they fit, Berdan brass has the anvil on the case instead of the primer itself so it may not even light off. Do you have a reloading manual?"

You need to know what you need, you can’t just take the guy at the counter’s word for it. You should have at least a basic understanding of all the different primer types out there and when to use them. Berdan vs Boxer, rifle vs pistol, magnum vs non-magnum, etc."

The difference between Dak and Wentz can be simplified by looking at it like this. Both of them had outlier years in 2017. Wentz obviously had his elite year that he's since come crashing down from.

That was also Dak's lone bad season, throwing to the great WR core of the corpse of Dez Bryant, 35 year old Witten, Terrence Williams and Cole Beasley. This was all under the great Scott Linehan, who got fired the next season.

Dak is rightfully considered a top QB. He's got all the tools you want in a modern QB. He's a great passer with great mobility. His mechanics aren't sloppy like Wentz's."

9043,2020-12-15 09:13:06,kdba1t,"Not really much of a conversation though was it?

Lot to unpack there. Bottom line: I think dak is a better fantasy qb than real life qb, sure. Yes, they were empty stat games to start the year and a bad record, but the defense is atrocious. And yes, the cowboys are in cap hell. tbh I think the cowboys would be better off taking a rookie, cap wise. In the last decade I believe there was a stat that no QB in the top ~10 in salary in any given year won the super bowl.


A) their o line is a big problem. Zeke isn’t nearly as explosive but he and pollard are getting smashed behind the line of scrimmage anyway. A highly paid RB hasn’t won the title recently either (off the top of my head: Damien williams, Sony michel, Blount, james white, CJ Anderson, blount, **marshawn lynch**, ray rice, Ahmad Bradshaw, mendenhall...)

B) Zekes explosiveness has declined. I commented on here about it before the season. I think he’s still serviceable, but not elite. And the contract is obviously absurd (running theme). In terms of “Zeke central play style” - I think that’s overblown. Philosophy matters, but if I recall the cowboys drastically improved after Amari first came aboard. I’m not a cowboys fan but I remember people pushing back on that narrative when it first arose based on the numbers. 

C) Gallup will want to get paid I’m sure. Cowboys have a mess - I’ve also seen a stat that was like out of the last decade, only 1 WR on the super bowl winner was even top 7 in salary (#7 demaryius Thomas). Amari cooper is top 5. (Running theme).

D) truest of this years performance, but obvious.

The biggest problem is the cowboys are just absolutely screwed from a cap perspective. I doubt they’ll cop to it, but realistically they would need to find some way to offload Zeke (they can’t) or if not then offload cooper (maybe they can). But then they run the issue of losing all their wrs except lamb and needing to completely rebuild the only major strength they had left. 

Pretty much a masterclass in how to go from contender to bottom feeder through poor cap management, more than daks influence via his play. 

If we assume that dak gets re-signed for $35 M, the cowboys already have $145 M owed to 9 guys, none of whom are elite at their position. That’s 83% of the projected cap. They’d barely have enough room to sign their rookies.

- Dak: 35M
- Lawrence: 25M
- cooper: 22M
- Martin: 17M
- tyron smith: 14M
- Zeke: 14M
- Collins: 12M
- jaylon smith: 10M
- Blake jarwin: 5M

9044,2020-12-15 20:21:41,kdba1t,"Look at the team before and after his injury... Gtfo here with that nonsense. I hate the boys, and still can see how much value he has to the team and the league."
9045,2020-12-15 01:54:44,kdba1t,"Appreciate the shoutout lol. Most don’t want to admit it, but Prescott is hands down the most likely top-tier QB to go full Carson Wentz. In fact, Wentz has done a lot more in bad situations than him throughout their respective careers (I actually consider Wentz a buy-low. His current problem is fixable by the right coach, system, and supporting cast. Plus he’s more naturally talented than Prescott.)

Aside more all the reasons I laid out in the comments you cited, he has both an uncertain contract situation and an uncertain health situation. How effective can he be if his mobility is compromised? What would be his ceiling then? Jerry is already openly calling for him to run less, but we all know his arm talent is mediocre. What if he leaves the Cowboys and “reset the market” with some desperate doormat team?"
9046,2020-12-15 05:09:19,kdba1t,He is not is.
9047,2020-12-15 01:56:14,kdba1t,"How many games have Zach Martin and Tyron Smith play with Dalton? I’ll wait. All the WR talent in the world doesn’t matter when you have a practice squad-level o-line and don’t have time to throw. Martin, Smith, and the now retired Travis Frederick (3 perennial all-pro) were there since pre-Zeke/Prescott era. They turned the rotten corpse of Darren McFadden into a 1K rusher. Prescott and Zeke had benefited from their Hall of Fame-level blocking almost their entire careers. Now Frederick is retired and the other 2 are breaking down and on the wrong side of 30. Careers aren’t linear. Without elite o-line, Prescott would go right back to 2017 2nd half when he was objectively the worst QB in the league. Jerry saved his career by trading for Amari 5 games into 2018. He’s worse than Wentz. At least Wentz carried a depleted team into the playoffs last year. Prescott went 8-8 despite having a loaded team and that was when he made only 2 million. I'm a Cowboys fan and I would love to see a non-Cowboys team pay him 40 million a year and watch him get exposed as a fraud."
9048,2020-12-15 05:48:46,kdba1t,"> The difference between Dak and Wentz can be simplified by looking at it like this. Both of them had outlier years in 2017. Wentz obviously had his elite year that he's since come crashing down from.

Clown take. Before this season's debacle, Wentz has always done more with less while Prescott has always done less with more. The difference between Dak and Wentz can be simplified by the fact that Wentz dragged an injury-depleted Eagles to the playoffs last season while Prescott led a stacked Cowboys team to an 8-8 record despite the fact that they had a hilariously easy schedule with 7 games against the worst teams in the league (2 games against Redskins, 2 games against Giants, 1 game against tanking Dolphins, 1 game against Jets, 1 game against Lions).

Give a high-end backup-level QB like Case Keenum/Teddy Bridgewater THREE all-pro/future HOF offensive linemen (Zach Martin, Tyron Smith, Travis Frederick) and top 3 bellcow RB during the entirety of their rookie 4-year contracts and they would've done exactly what Prescott did so far in his career. Give them THREE WR1-level receivers (Amari, Gallup, Lamb) and they would've padded garbage time stats when opposing defenses are in prevent just like Prescott did early this season while going 1-3. Even a high-end backup/fringe starting QB like Bridgewater currently has a 96 QB rating and averages 259 yards passing per game under Joe Brady's system, but the most telling stat is that he's 0-7 in games when he has a chance at a game-winning drive. Prescott was the same last season. Dude is overrated trash and the biggest fraud in the NFL. It's not a coincidence that the minute the Cowboys moved from a Zeke-centric offense to a Prescott-centric one, they ceased being competitive.

> That was also Dak's lone bad season, throwing to the great WR core of the corpse of Dez Bryant, 35 year old Witten, Terrence Williams and Cole Beasley. This was all under the great Scott Linehan, who got fired the next season.

Yeah, sure scapegoat Dez. Scapegoat Linehan. Scapegoat Garrett. Scapegoat Hurns. Scapegoat Kellen Moore. Scapegoat Jerry Jones. Nothing is ever Prescott's fault. He is entitled to BOTH reset the market AND have the perfect supporting cast in a salary cap league. He is the only one in the NFL who deserves to have his cake and eat it too. Gimme a fucking break! I'm sick and tired of this narrative. Mike Evans isn't doing great with old fart Brady, who preferred Scotty Miller pre-AB. Is that Evans' fault or Brady's fault? Obviously, it's Brady's. No one on this sub is blaming Evans. So how was it Dez's fault that that Prescott couldn't throw with anticipation and would rather force-feed slot Cole Beasley? Dez wasn't washed. He got scapegoated. The whole rationale of scapegoating Dez and getting rid of him was that ""Allen Hurns"" was supposed a more ""Dak-friendly"" WR. When Hurns flopped, the pro-Prescott narrative turned into Hurns sucked. Blah blah. More excuses. Aaron Rodgers made it work with the rotten corpse of James Jones as his WR1 in 2015 (Jordy Nelson out for season, Davante Adams considered a bust). Young Tom Brady made it work for years with Deion Branch as his WR1. Young Russell Wilson made it work with undrafted Doug Baldwin (a role player until age-27) as his WR1 and Jermaine Kearse/Paul Richardson as his WR2 and running for his life behind a shit o-line. Enough with the excuses. If Prescott wants 40 million a year, he needs to elevate trash WRs and run for his life behind a shit o-line. Otherwise, their defense would always be as trash as it is this year and their record would be trash no matter how much Prescott pads his personal stats. It's a salary cap league. Can't pay everybody.

> Dak is rightfully considered a top QB. He's got all the tools you want in a modern QB. He's a great passer with great mobility. His mechanics aren't sloppy like Wentz's.

He's the only so-called ""top QB"" who has never shown any ability whatsoever to be functional with less-than-perfect circumstances. You think he can do what Deshaun Watson is doing right now throwing to Keke Coutee and Chad Hansen? Gimme a break! He neither possesses great raw arm talent (like Wentz, Josh Allen, Mahomes, etc) nor particularly accurate (like Brees, Brady, etc), so his ceiling has always been limited. His mobility is solid, but far from even prime Russell Wilson-level (forget about Lamar Jackson, Kyler Murray, Jalen Hurts, Taysom Hill). Is he any more mobile than prime Aaron Rodgers? No. He has literally no standout tool. Remember when retired draft bust David Carr embarrassed him on live TV https://youtu.be/x1wokslD-Hk? Dude is a bum. If he weren't lucky enough to get drafted by the Cowboys, he would be a backup QB right now."

9050,2020-12-15 02:32:23,kdba1t,"I don’t think it’s fair at all to compare him to wentz. Wentz makes some insanely bad decisions, justifying why Jalen hurts would start over him. Wentz sees wide open guys down field and throws it short to be safe lol, I’ve witnessed it so often. I’m not sure what bad situations you’re talking about, but Dak was clearly a fantastic garbage time QB and wentz has not been. I agree with you that out of the top tier QB’s Dak is the most uncertain out of all of them, but he will at least have a job next year, while it’s still uncertain whether or not wentz will even be playing for his own team. I’d rather have the guy who has to agree to a contract rather than one who is in contract and benched due to poor play. You certainly are right though both are very uncertain and wentz value is accounting for that while it doesn’t seem like Dak’s value is."

9084,2020-12-15 03:15:47,kdb0xl,He was going to get it but they got to the one yard line before hand and Pete got nervous.
9085,2020-12-15 03:18:25,kdb0xl,I just can’t see Penny having a big impact in the next two weeks. Maybe if there was more time. There were a couple games last year towards the end of the year where they both looked really good.. then they both got hurt.
9086,2020-12-15 03:04:39,kdb0xl,Gotta hang on to Hyde
9087,2020-12-15 03:08:46,kdb0xl,"I would hold until the game. But the Seahawks are going to give Penny work if he is ready. They used a first round pick on him, they will commit to him over Hyde if both are healthy."

9096,2020-12-15 04:26:24,kdb0xl,Yeah it really depends on where he is at. He was legit making a run for Carson's job last year.
9097,2020-12-15 01:10:44,kdb0xl,Definitely not
9098,2020-12-15 01:19:58,kdb0xl,Probably maybe not
9099,2020-12-15 01:13:37,kdb0xl,Never liked Penny.    Slow and hurt.   He reminds my of Flash Gordon and AJ Green and AB now.    Never going to live up to 10% of the hype.

9101,2020-12-15 06:20:51,kdb0xl,You’re saying Pete caroll has an only fans??
9102,2020-12-16 00:39:08,kdb0xl,"Oh it’s a possibility, I just think it’s unlikely in the next two weeks. Again referring to having a major impact in terms of fantasy, not a real life impact for the Hawks. 

I’m also a Hawks fan and have heard similar rumblings. One thing I think you need to be wary of is coach speak, especially from Carroll who is famous for it, and there is a big difference between looking better than expected and being in game shape. Penny hasn’t played an actual football game in over a year. It’s possible but unlikely that a player that has been out for that long can simply jump back into a major workload in their first game or two, especially when the team has two serviceable backs in Carson and Hyde."
9103,2020-12-15 07:47:08,kdb0xl,Not sure why this is being downvoted. Penny has definitely looked electric at times. Especially near the end of 2019 before he got hurt.
9104,2020-12-15 20:10:48,kdb0xl,Too many Carson owners

9133,2020-12-15 10:08:11,kda72s,Can't be overstated what he will add to this offense when you consider we are also getting Penny back as well. Josh will be huge for 3rd downs. Come playoffs god forbid any new injuries crop up our offense should get scary again. Just have to not turn the ball over.
9134,2020-12-15 18:19:20,kda72s,Are we going to sing the Flash/Josh Gordon song again?

9140,2020-12-15 18:59:34,kda72s,To bad he’s not a woman beater could have played for the whole season /s
9141,2020-12-15 15:57:15,kda72s,...but its not like we have a DE laying around waiting to get reinstated?
9142,2020-12-15 17:33:31,kda72s,"Considering the relative offensive vs defensive output over the last few weeks, I don’t think I agree with you. Russ has been the point of weakness so helping him out is what we need right now."

If you’ve seen off-season footage, I’d be surprised if Gordon isn’t really to roll"
9148,2020-12-15 02:48:06,kda72s,"Also, Gordon is in the facility and training right now, just can’t “practice” until next week. Plus he’s been working all season hoping he’d be reinstated."
9149,2020-12-15 02:20:09,kda72s,"Much sooner. Snacks was in retirement mode, and didn’t work out. Gordon has been in exercise mode, because he wants to be back on the field."
9150,2020-12-15 02:25:06,kda72s,Hopefully Pete has been sneaking him out playbook or something huh
9151,2020-12-15 12:28:20,kda72s,He’s been training in private and with his own coach since the start of the start of the zoom pre season and people have been seeing him run around his neighborhood so I think other than game pacing abd getting used to taking hits I think he’ll be read on down one but I also think it’ll take till mid way through the niners game to really get acclimated to playing in a game 100%
9152,2020-12-15 12:04:23,kda72s,"Snacks possibly retired and was chilling with his kids when he decided football was better

Flash has been signed the whole year and has kept in game shape,
All he needs to do is get reacquainted with the more aggressive offense and he’s good"
9153,2020-12-15 05:29:09,kda72s,"I’d assume going over the playbook doesn’t even count as “practicing” with the team, so yeah he probably knows it."
9154,2020-12-15 14:17:25,kda72s,He probably wouldn't be in much other than 3rd down attempts for a little while anyways
9155,2020-12-15 15:45:04,kda72s,"Probably as that other vertical threat guy yeah, I’m sure cause he already played a bunch of games last season and more acquainted with Russ and our offense than when he came over last year.

9327,2020-12-30 15:27:07,kn399u,"Godwin will be tagged for sure. I'd love James White to come in.

I also see Gronk and AB staying strictly cause of Brady.

As far as making cap room, they can rework Evans, Marpet, and Brady's contracts to make room for the signings they need."
9328,2020-12-30 15:28:28,kn399u,"I don't see teams trading for Brate's contract. I think he'll be a cap cut along with Donovan Smith, but I think Brate might re-sign for a lower amount"
9329,2020-12-30 15:59:27,kn399u,re-sign is to come back. Resign means to quit.
9330,2020-12-30 15:06:12,kn399u,Please go get James White.
9331,2020-12-30 15:53:28,kn399u,I think that there will be a lot of people wanting to come to Tampa to play with Brady and go for a ring.  I will also go so far as to say that a number of them will take a salary cut to come here.
9332,2020-12-30 16:13:06,kn399u,"First of all we play a 3-4/Hybrid Defense not a 4-3. Devin White also doesnt have the size to consistently blitz every or every other down, he is effective as the 5/6th blitzer because of his speed when the OL is worried about the big bodies.

I agree about the the offensive points you made, I agree Brate is probably gone as we'll save 6 mil there as will Donovan Smith as that will add an additional 14mil to our cap.

We have about 30 mil in Cap, if we cut Brate and Smith that get us to 50 mil. 6-8 mil has to be saved to sign our rookie class so lets saw we have 42 mil for free agents.

42 Mil Cap Space:

Godwin hopefully takes 14mil per to stay with Brady

Shaq hopefully signs for 12mil with his reduced numbers this year

LVD hopefully takes a team friendly deal at 8mil per to retire a Buc

If this works out this way that's 36mil spent on our main Free agents leaving us with 6mil to re-sign either Gronk or Suh, I'd prefer Gronk to keep the offense in tact and to give brady his safety blanket at TE.

Then in the Draft you go DL in the first to replace Suh. In the second and third we hopefully go RT and Edge in any order, although if we want a starter at RT that will probably go in the 2nd and then Edge depth behind Shaq and JPP in the 3rd. then from there on you go BPA hopefully filling depth at CB, RB, DL, and LB.

This is what I think would be the best case scenario for the team in the off-season."
9333,2020-12-30 16:07:18,kn399u,How long do you guys think Brady will play? He obviously isn’t slowing down at all.
9334,2020-12-30 14:41:52,kn399u,"Call me crazy but me thinks they can just move devin white to shaqs spot if we dont re-sign him and not really lose production, they seem to be of similar play styles and white has just as much explosiveness as shaq.  It would also take white out of pass coverage."
9335,2020-12-30 16:24:41,kn399u,"I don´t get it why so many here think that we can replace Donovan Smith that easily.

I know that he is not a top 10 LT and gets a lot of blame in this subreddit but he is suitable. Yes his contract is too much but my point is that you can not replace a guy like him the way many here think we can.

We had so much luck that Wirfs plays so incredible good for a rookie that many here seemed to forget that the transition from College to the NFL for an OT is not easy.

In my opinion we can´t risk relying on another draft pick to be that good and let Smith go. Brady would be in his last year and we definitely should not risk loosing that year because our draft pick OT is not playing the way we hoped he would.

Also I don´t think we would get a better LT on the free agent market for a better price then what we got in Smith right now."
9336,2020-12-31 01:02:21,kn399u,I fully expected a bunch of comments saying to stfu because we’re in the playoffs
9337,2020-12-30 15:34:56,kn399u,Stephon Gilmore. Could possibly take a decent 1/2 year deal because of Brady and knowing he is chasing another ring.

9340,2020-12-30 16:08:25,kn399u,[deleted]
9341,2020-12-30 16:25:20,kn399u,Thanks for correcting my spell. Appreciate it.
9342,2020-12-30 15:14:05,kn399u,I also think it's highly probable.
9343,2020-12-30 16:21:01,kn399u,"Yea I was gonna point out we run a 3-4 as well I’d like to keep David, Godwin, shaq, and suh although gronk would be great to have I think replacing suh will be harder than replacing gronk so suh would take priority for me"
9344,2020-12-30 16:23:06,kn399u,Thanks for the defensive scheme. I got that wrong.
9345,2020-12-30 17:47:51,kn399u,"He's definitely playing next season. And I would highly bet he plays the season after barring injury or regression. This would make him 45 (the age he said he said he could play to a couple years ago). I doubt he'll play for a fourth Bucs season (3rd after this one) but who knows. 

My guess would be bare minimum one more season, and most likely 2 more with a chance at 3/4."
9346,2020-12-30 16:21:00,kn399u,You're crazy
9347,2020-12-30 15:00:51,kn399u,"That's an interesting take. I think if they don't sign Shaq , I am quite interested if they go for drafting Joe Tryon from Washington. Man he is a disrupter. He just flies off the edge. At 6-5,262 guy, he is more like a JPP type OLB/DE guy. I don't think they wanna move White mainly because of his short stature as an OLB."
9348,2020-12-30 19:39:22,kn399u,Because he’s getting paid 15m and he’s not worth 15m
9349,2020-12-31 20:02:19,kn399u,"In no way should Donovan smith stay on our team. He is a consistent liability in ways that I don’t see on any other team. I’d actually go as far as to say that Donovan smith is among the worst LTs in the game, younger players (rookies) included. 

I agree with your assessment though that he will be tough to replace. I would be looking to replace him in free agency with a guy who we know will produce, even if it means we can’t re-sign suh and gronk. We absolutely need to continue bolstering our O line if we want our team to take the next step, and I think Smith is the weakest link"
9350,2020-12-30 17:59:05,kn399u,This is not a dumb take. Gilmore wanted to come to Tampa Bay in the off-season. They were on his list.
9351,2020-12-30 16:02:00,kn399u,He has one more year on his deal and the Pats eat 7.5mm dead cap if they cut or trade
9352,2020-12-30 16:23:36,kn399u,Did not get your point man.
9353,2020-12-30 17:57:39,kn399u,It doesn't do him dirty. He get's his money faster on a restructure.
9354,2020-12-30 16:31:49,kn399u,"I like Brate but $6.8 million for a backup/third string TE is insane. He practically makes as much as guys like Darren Waller or Jared Cook. For 2020, we're spending the most on the position in the entire NFL and we're not getting nearly the production that teams like the Raiders or Chiefs are.

Looking at 2021, we're 6th in the NFL right now and that's without re-signing Gronk. We picked up OJ's option so we can't cut him without a penalty anymore.

If Gronk leaves or OJ is traded or something, I'd be fine with keeping him. But if our cap is tight at all, his salary is a waste of resources."
9355,2020-12-30 16:17:18,kn399u,"Yea i dont understand the logic behind that at all,i think brate can easily be a top recieving te in the league when given the opportunity."
9356,2020-12-30 16:40:55,kn399u,Because we have many guys we need to sign and Brate is a 3rd TE if we bring back Gronk. 6-7 mill is too much for a 3rd TE in my opinion
9357,2020-12-31 21:33:14,kn399u,No problem. I was just really confused why you wanted these players to leave. Personally I think its dumb they made two words so close have opposite meanings
9358,2020-12-30 16:23:40,kn399u,"Yea Suh is a boss as well, I’d be cool with either and if we can work some other cap magic it’d be awesome to keep both I just cant think of another player that will be easy to cut, maybe William Gholston as he might be easier to replace in the draft?"
9359,2020-12-30 16:31:11,kn399u,"No worries, before Bowles we historically were always 4-3 so its not a crazy mistake to make"
9360,2020-12-30 18:38:55,kn399u,Just a comment on how many posts have been saying we should get different guys from the pats. I don't have any problems with pats i enjoyed watching those great patriot teams. Just commenting on how the Bucs sub has changed. Not for better or worse. Just has changed
9361,2020-12-30 16:42:01,kn399u,"This was my reasoning as well, but I guess some people don't think logically or believe everyone should do what the Saints do for caps"
9362,2020-12-30 16:40:03,kn399u,"I’d understand making the argument to restructure his contract, but that’s not what people are saying. 

This thread has people saying that he should either be a) cut or b) traded for draft picks (future resource) while we’re in a super bowl
Window.  

He’s a significantly better depth player and insurance policy than Auclair and Hudson... why create a hole when you don’t need to? Like shit, if Gronk goes down in the playoffs are you fine with trotting out Hudson+Auclair? Do people want to spend a draft pick on a depth TE we have to develop over the next 3 years to maybe hit on? Doesn’t make sense to me"
9363,2020-12-30 18:43:07,kn399u,He is quite good mostly on 3rd Downs running the underneath routes. But the cap space is what concerns me. If it was a normal season and the cap going up I don't think we would need anything to speculate about but the cap coming down is the issue.
9364,2020-12-30 16:26:10,kn399u,I don’t know honestly maybe some players take pay cuts or restructure contract to give us more space and I definitely agree we need to draft someone to take smiths spot either in the 1st or 2nd round unless someone falls real far and you just take best available
9365,2020-12-30 17:11:59,kn399u,Yeah interestingly Todd has coached both 4-3 as well as 3-4 .
9366,2020-12-30 18:55:05,kn399u,"Oh okay. But whatever I wrote I based it out of Spotrac . So according to what I thought I might have seen , I suggested it. And I think much of the Pats fan will be here mainly due to Tom. But I aint gonna lie I used to watch Bucs games last year and Mike and Godwin used to just jump out of the screen especially the Rams game. I was like who are these guys. So you can say I am A Bucs, Pats and a forever TB12 fan."
9367,2020-12-30 16:49:36,kn399u,"I think I understand you. It's not a bad thing to have insurance there. But the NFL has a salary cap.

What if Brate's salary prevents us from keeping Godwin? Or David? Barrett? Suh? Gronk? AB? What if keeping him prevents us from bringing in a pass-catching RB? I guess it just depends on where you draw that line."
9368,2020-12-30 17:25:56,kn399u,Oh cool I just remember him also doing the 3-4 with the jets but thats probably because they had the alot if players that fit the scheme from the Rex Ryan days
9369,2020-12-30 20:01:27,kn399u,He is the G.O.A.T......has been for awhile
9370,2020-12-30 17:03:14,kn399u,"Totally fair and I recognize the hard salary cap issues. 

I just don’t think it keeping his cap would be *preventing* much.... and if it is *preventing* something, the restructure makes much more sense imo. We could convert his base salary to bonus at the end of this year imo. Take the 6mil cap hit and turning it into 4mil or 2mil... but also I don’t think 4mil in cap will be a deal breaker for those guys you mentioned? 

Like David, Gronk, and Barrett want to be here.... Godwin and AB could be mitigated by adding more years to their deal or adding to their signing bonus (ex: Godwin wants 4 mil more in year 1, add that to his signing bonus and it’s paid in year 1 but cap hit is spread over 4 years)... Suh might be the guy who cares the most about $$ but the FO would have to be willing to pay him more $$, not just be able to. 

I don’t know IMO I think there’s ways to be creative and keep the players we want. Could be totally wrong tho."
9371,2020-12-30 17:26:14,kn399u,"There are. But at that point, you're starting to get into mortgaging the future for this SB window. We haven't done that to this point. I think he also took a pay cut last year, so I'm not sure what more he'd be open to.

It just depends how much of a priority you consider Brate. For me, he has 27 catches this year, and that's with OJ out most of the year. I just don't think he's worth it. I'd honestly get a kick out of him getting the chance to start somewhere else."
9372,2020-12-30 17:35:24,kn399u,">	There are. But at that point, you’re starting to get into mortgaging the future for this SB window. We haven’t done that to this point. I think he also took a pay cut last year, so I’m not sure what more he’d be open to.

Understood - all totally fair and valid 

>	It just depends how much of a priority you consider Brate. For me, he has 27 catches this year, and that’s with OJ out most of the year. I just don’t think he’s worth it.

One slight nitpick here - I think it’s how much you consider Brate a priority *combined with* how much it’ll cost ([dollars or draft picks] + coaching and development time) to replace him. Imo there’s no reason to force ourselves to rely on Auclair, Hudson, or someone else if we don’t have to. If we absolutely need the cap space or something, then it’s a different story. 

>	I’d honestly get a kick out of him getting the chance to start somewhere else.

I feel like it always sucks to see guys we invested time in to go on and perform somewhere else, so that’s just sunk cost bias + team favoritism on my part hahah"

While I agree Miami would be the easiest team of the 5 possible wildcards, I do worry about having to face them in back-to-back weeks. I feel like we should run a super vanilla offense and rest most of our starters this week to avoid giving too much away.

9420,2020-12-30 15:02:23,kn2ty7,Yeah I don't want to have to actually play for the win with starters Week 17 and then try to run it back immediately in the Wild Card. I'd still feel confident about the Bills but it's hard to beat a team 3 times in a season

9422,2020-12-30 16:04:04,kn2ty7,Fair enough his 5 interceptions last year is a HUGE number for an LB. But in 2020 he has regressed there a bit with 0 INT and giving up a 82.5% Cmp %. He is a monster over the middle though and does worry me. If we do end up playing in the playoffs I'll break down his game a bit more with a lot more accuracy!
9423,2020-12-30 16:44:47,kn2ty7,Something I think a lot of us Bills fans are struggling with determining. Personally I think it will be a quarter by quarter thing where the Bills are monitoring the Steelers game as well as their own. Since the Bills only need a win OR Steelers loss they can afford to lose Sunday and still take the 2 seed.
9424,2020-12-30 16:45:27,kn2ty7,I think we’ll probably play the starters for a quarter or half but not the entire game

9433,2020-12-30 14:05:46,kn26f7,I think laser bore sights are to get you on paper when you sight it at 40 yards with actual ammo. You use the laser to sight at 25 yards then use ammo to sight at 40 and 100 yards
9434,2020-12-30 14:35:20,kn26f7,"I’m not sure they are really necessary. If you take the top half of the gun and look down the barrel at at target, you can make basic enough corrections to get you on paper."
9435,2020-12-30 15:08:18,kn26f7,"How Ive done it on probably 50 rifles at this point:

Boresight if you have one- if not it really doesnt matter, just get a cheap one that fits multiple calibers if you really want to or your only option is indoor ranges.

Setup rifle on a rest so that it doesnt move much, a sled makes it even easier.

Shoot at target.

Note where the dirt kicked up (if youre already on paper just crank the turrets over to the hole in the target) and crank the turrets til the sights line up on that spot. 

Shoot again.

Make minor adjustment bringing sights onto hole in target.

Shoot 3-5 shot groups and adjust as needed.

Dont keep adjusting all day, its probably just you being a shitty shot."
9436,2020-12-30 14:49:43,kn26f7,Bore sight and adjust your optics as needed. Watch IraqVet8888 YouTube on it. Super easy. I do it for all my firearms
9437,2020-12-30 15:57:25,kn26f7," dead on 25 yard zero should get you within 2 inches of zero at at 100 yards. 

if you can hit the target with the flip up sights, the just adjust them.

if you've read how to adjust iron sights, it should about 5 rounds to get on the red."
9438,2020-12-30 16:07:00,kn26f7,"I think its easier to learn that way and get you in the ballpark.

You'll want to fine tune with ammo and some rest to keep shots consistent.

I have two types of boresights.
1 cartridge that is a laser point. Its was ok. 

This will be cheaper short term and go up for each rifle you need to sight in.

2 a multi caliber that uses a rubber gasket to fit in the bore.

This was more accurate but be careful not to have too tight of a fit or that gasket may get stuck in the bore.  I couldn't knock it out so i just let the thing soak in hoppies until it came out.

If you want balls on accurate get a sled or at least a bag to rest on."
9439,2020-12-30 16:19:01,kn26f7,"I manually bore sighted all my rifles to get on paper.  For your purpose go to around 17 minutes into the video, see link below.  It saved me time, rounds and I didn't have to pay for laser bore sight equipment.

I don't listen to audible on days I'm pushing hard (running also something I've only got into in the past year) but more if I am going out for a 5-10k at an easier pace. Maybe as I'm not focusing as much on breathing and time that I tend to focus more on the book!"

9471,2020-12-30 17:25:35,kn0a8a,Bonjour
9472,2020-12-30 07:19:13,kmx64q,"Depends on the board.  Assuming they pick at 15, the optimistic target list looks like DeVonta Smith, Jaylen Waddle, Kyle Pitts, maybe trade up for someone like Trey Lance or Zach Wilson(I'm assuming he's gone in the top 5 for sure) or Micah Parsons.  I could see them grabbing Rosseau or Paye if either slip"
9473,2020-12-30 17:43:47,kmx64q,"Honestly, they have to get a QB. I’ve heard Belichick really likes Lance, so I expect them to take him if he’s still on the board and/or they can move up. If they don’t take a QB in the first, I think they might go with Pitts, then draft Mac Jones in the 2nd (Belichick and Saban are old friends, so Belichick knows everything there is to know about Mac and has a chance to draft him unlike Tua), and then sign Allen Robinson in free agency. The Patriots are the most interesting team heading into this draft in my opinion. I can see them being very aggressive this year, and I think we’ll see them doing a lot of trades."
9474,2020-12-31 04:40:42,kmx64q,"Trade down

1 Draft corner who will be cut in a year

2 D-line that will be rotational

3 Random guard that will become a starter down the road

4 Wr that will be cut after 2 years

5 O-linemen that will be injury plagued

6 Special teams ace

7 Random Wr or dB that becomes a pro bowler in a few seasons"
9475,2020-12-30 10:20:10,kmx64q,"If one of the top 4 QBs are available, I hope they pull the trigger. At least two of them, likely three, won’t be available when they pick. They might be able to luck into a guy like Lance or Fields who could fall depending on what a team wants. I don’t believe Stafford or Ryan are moving this offseason. Same with Wentz; are they really going to move on from the guy after ONE bad year?! Especially after they just signed him to a huge extension, I don’t think so. Furthermore, the general belief is that teams don’t let young, quality starting QBs in free agency. Dak will not be a FA in all likelihood, or will return to Dallas. Everybody else who would be available will not be good. Hoyer, Cam, and Stidham are not the answer. I think it’s more likely than not that Jimmy G will be on the SF roster, at least until June 2. Drafting or trading up to draft a QB is my number 1 option for our first round pick.

After that, a WR could be extremely valuable, depending on what they do in free agency. IMO, Meyers is the only guarantee to be on the roster next year; maybe Byrd depending on his contract situation in free agency. If they do make a significant move in FA, I wouldn’t expect them to address the situation until the 3rd round at the earliest unless a guy they fall in love with falls.

Tight end (Pitts) is a popular mock, but I think it’s the most unlikely depending on how the board falls of course. They have already spent significant capital in the position last year, using 2 third round pick and 2 fourth round picks to both trade up and select 2 tight ends. Granted, the position is still abysmal, but it would be a luxury pick if anything given the general lack of production from rookie TEs. I would only be comfortable with this pick if all of the top QBs and WRs are gone. Like many other teams in this league, it’s a need, but not THAT big of a need. Plenty of teams survive (and even thrive) offensively without having a good pass catching TE.

I doubt they take a DT at their current position. The only way I see them drafting one in the first round would be if the Pats were to trade down to the 20s. Simply no good options available that high in the draft.

CB is a possibility. I believe it’s much less likely than the above, but it’s a possibility. Depending on Gilmore’s status on the team, I could see the Pats drafting a CB. Jason McCourty is getting older and has not been playing well this year (or last year TBH). If Gilmore is traded, I could see them taking a flier on a CB, as long as no good QBs are still available.

MLB is the only other position I could see Bill take in the 1st. Don’t know much about them in this class, so I won’t go into depth.


As for who I want in the draft (ranked in order of position and prospect)

QB- I think Trey Lance is the most realistic possibility of all of the QBs. He is firmly ranked 4th of the first tier of QBs, but it’s mostly due to his lack of experience. I love his upside, and I know that McDaniels and BB would put him in a position to exceed even if he does not meet his potential. (Obviously Zach Wilson/Justin Fields are arguably better, but they are unlikely to be available by the time the Pats pick)

WR- Jaylen Waddle/Devonta Smith

TE- Pitts I guess (certainly not a bad consolation prize tbf)

MLB- idk I’m not an NFL scout and I trust BB

CB- same as MLB explanation

Edit: all this talk about Mac Jones and Kyle Trask just remind me of Jacob Eason and Jake Fromm last year; they both got mocked to the pats in the first/second round and they both got drafted in the fourth/fifth round. Idk about them but whatever"
9476,2020-12-30 17:52:22,kmx64q,"A lot of mock drafts have the Pats taking a WR in the first round, I just don't see it. WR in the first round is like a cherry on top of an ice cream sundae, it's the finishing piece. This team has way too many holes to be taking a WR in the first round. Also, the Pats haven't had a big play/stud WR since Randy Moss. Plus with all the free agents, it's easy to address.

I'd say QB or Pitts is the obvious picks. Pats offense revolves around the TE and having someone like Pitts would help a lot. But they also need interior linebackers and, depending on FA/Gilmore situation, cornerbacks."
9477,2020-12-30 07:30:56,kmx64q,They will probably trade out of the first
9478,2020-12-30 19:28:31,kmx64q,"Hard to see the pats taking a QB in the first. I think they address QB and WR in free agency, getting a second tier guy in both spots, then go defense in the first round. 

I still can't believe how bad they were on defense this year, they desperately need more speed in the front 7. Middle linebacker or DE is where I see them going."
9479,2020-12-30 14:25:34,kmx64q,Mac Jones would fit very well imo
9480,2020-12-30 07:26:09,kmx64q,"I'm not sold on them drafting QB or WR in the first. It may seem far fetched at first but I think Bill would draft CB Caleb Farley and look to upgrade QB/WR in free agency and later in the draft. Gilmore is 30 and coming off a knee injury, Jackson is an RFA, Jason McCourty is 33. Williams hasn't shown much. Jones and Bryant are slot guys. Not sure if anyone else noticed all the miscommunication in the secondary this year but I'm sure Bill did."
9481,2020-12-30 18:33:26,kmx64q,"It may take some trading up but Zach Wilson is the guy i think fits in best in this draft class.

9482,2020-12-30 15:23:53,kmx64q,Kyle Pitts would be the best Tight End and Wide Receiver  on the team so I say get two birds stoned at once.
9483,2020-12-30 08:41:00,kmx64q,"Devonta Smith first round Mac jones second round, they have insane chemistry together already."
9484,2020-12-30 14:47:55,kmx64q,"I think Mac Jones is interesting but he's been the beneficiary of massive skills mismatches along the OL, and especially in having an NFL quality WR corps playing against Division I corners. 

Those mismatches aren't going to cut in his favor anymore at the next level.

He is probably a ""value,"" to use a Belichick term, at a 2nd or 3rd round pick. 

That leaves maybe a few corners, maybe Pitts -- though I agree its unlikely given the picks invested last year, as neither Keene nor Asiasi have demonstrated any NFL level skills -- and perhaps a top shelf WR prospect like Devontae Smith."
9485,2020-12-30 17:07:40,kmx64q,"Unless they land a good QB through trade or in free agency, I think QB should be the move.  I can't see them throwing away another season starting Cam or Stidham."
9486,2020-12-30 17:43:19,kmx64q,I love Trey Lance. Wilson has talent but has character issues and already having surgery on his throwing shoulder concerns me. WR is such a massive need that I don't think anyone could argue with them going that route. It's so hard to predict what Bill will do in any draft
9487,2021-01-01 23:17:41,kmx64q,"I think in a in classic pats trade they move back to get a ton of 3rds and 4th. BUT, I think they move up in the end of the 1st to take Mac Jones. He just seems like a good fit as they have been very successful with a pure pocket passer for 20 years"
9488,2021-01-04 02:34:52,kmx64q,"Hard to say because Patriots have a lot of cap space and with cap likely going down, a lot of teams are likely going to need to cut some of their vets and also less teams can afford to sign FAs.  Which means Pats have a much better chance compare to other years to sign some big name/productive vets to address their needs.  So who they draft will really depend on what needs they are able to address in FA."
9489,2021-01-13 04:05:52,kmx64q,"I think you just wait it out and take,maybe Waddle.That will be as good a deal as trading up for a QB Once you factor in lost draft capital in moving up."
9490,2020-12-30 16:57:44,kmx64q,"I think the obvious thing people will point to is QB, but I don't think that'll happen. With all their cap space, coaching staff, track record of success, and Bill's likely retirement in the next 5-10 years, I think they make a move for a trade/FA QB. If any one of Matt Stafford, Matt Ryan, Phillip Rivers, or maybe even Gardner Minshew come available, they take a hard look. Of Jacoby Brissett and potentially Jimmy Garroppolo may be intriguing as well. Throw in Marcus Mariota and Carson Wentz, and that's a ton of talent and they likely have their pick of the litter.

Then logically you start thinking about WR/TE. I don't think the Pats will jump ship on Devin Asiasi and Dalton Keene who they pick Day 2 last year, but neither will also deter them from a special talent like Kyle Pitts. Any of the other big three in Smith/Chase/Waddle will be considered. I would say that's the most likely.

The lack of depth on the interior DL will attract them to Daviyon Nixon and Jay Tufele, two stud DT prospects. I think they'll have to fight the Vikings for Nixon but could probably trade back and still get Tufele. 

LB is a possibility. Depending on what they do with D'Onta Hightower (I expect he'll be either cut or extended) then Zaven Collins may be in play there. JOK could as well as, again, I doubt they give up on early picks Anfernee Jennings and Josh Uche, but he's good value.

I really doubt they go DE, OL, DB, or RB in the first. They could, but I doubt it. So you're, in my mind looking at them probably lock in on one of those 4 WR/TE I mentioned. That's just my prediction. They can spin it a variety of ways, and you'll have a lot more clarity after FA."
9491,2020-12-30 18:41:19,kmx64q,A receiver. Doesn't matter which one because they won't pan out
9492,2020-12-31 17:10:43,kmx64q,"I think if Pitts is there, you take him. That simple."
9493,2020-12-30 06:52:45,kmx64q,"They need a man beating WR... olave, Ross , chase, smith come to mind ."
9494,2020-12-30 15:40:35,kmx64q,"I have them picking Trey Lance, Kyle Trask or Kyle Pitts, the QB's are because Cam isnt going to stay their forever and they fit what Bill is looking for, PItts because he's the #1 TE in the draft and we know how good the Pats are with a great Tight End"
9495,2020-12-30 15:40:59,kmx64q,"Wilson= gone

Smith= gone

Lance= maybe there

Waddle= maybe there

Pitts= ✅"
9496,2020-12-30 15:57:51,kmx64q,"I'm hoping we don't grab a WR and go for free agents instead.  For years I just said it was bad luck that we always bust with WR, but at this point there has to be something to it."
9497,2020-12-30 19:35:33,kmx64q,"> Honestly, they have to get a QB. I’ve heard Belichick really likes Lance, so I expect them to take him if he’s still on the board and/or they can move up.

I think it's far more likely that Belichick is unimpressed by most of these QB prospects and ends up signing another cheap veteran like he did last year."
9498,2020-12-31 01:56:48,kmx64q,Where did you hear about Belichick liking Lance? I’d be curious to learn more.
9499,2020-12-31 06:49:11,kmx64q,The patriot way lol
9500,2020-12-30 14:14:12,kmx64q,One really fun LB that I love is Zaven Collins. Dont know how well he would fit in NE but hes a great player.
9501,2020-12-30 18:08:53,kmx64q,"Ryan isn’t moving this season, but there’s a pretty decent chance we take a QB."
9502,2020-12-30 14:13:31,kmx64q,"God Lance would be a hideously bad pick for them. He’s going to need the absolutely perfect situation. Putting him with McDaniels who’s never developed anyone with the worst receiving corps in the league, behind Cam who is routinely benched, with fans that are conditioned to immediate success.

I’m not convinced Lance will succeed in the NFL anywhere, but New England would be a death sentence for his career."
9503,2020-12-30 19:30:37,kmx64q,"> Plus with all the free agents, it's easy to address.

Totally agree. There's no way they spend another first rounder on a WR when there's holes up and down the roster. They'll sign a guy like TY Hilton or Marvin Jones, or probably somebody worse and cheaper. A lot of people in this thread saying what they would do and just ignoring the fact that Bill Belichick is the coach, interior LB is my prediction."
9504,2020-12-31 16:19:49,kmx64q,"> WR in the first round is like a cherry on top of an ice cream sundae, it's the finishing piece. 

I think this is a kind of out-dated philosophy. I wouldn't draft one in the top-5 (reserved for franchise QB prospects and scarce freak-show DE/OT IMO), but after that it's a good position to draft high. PFF has it down as the most valuable position after QB these days, which I think makes sense. A true WR1 whose mere threat is enough to dictate to defenses is the single most important component of modern offense, aside from the QB of course.  

Not saying NE has to draft WR this year, as you said there are other options. Just debating the concept in general."
9505,2020-12-30 14:01:18,kmx64q,Trade down not out I could see them getting a late 1st plus 3rd
9506,2020-12-30 10:03:57,kmx64q,They’re picking at 14. How the hell are they going to completely trade out of it?
9507,2020-12-30 17:04:23,kmx64q,They have traded out of the first round twice in the last decade. The same number of times they've traded up in the first.
9508,2021-01-05 00:59:20,kmx64q,theres nothing in free agency tho.
9509,2020-12-30 15:13:25,kmx64q,CB is definitely something I’ve toyed around with myself. Derion Kendrick seems like a perfect fit I’ve even tossed around the idea of them drafting a DT and in only one mock I had them taking an EDGE. They aren’t completely married to a WR or Pitts.
9510,2020-12-30 16:25:06,kmx64q,"I think they'll go CB earlier than some think, but I don't think it's in the first. I feel like the Pats tend to look for DBs in the Day 2 range."
9511,2020-12-30 18:14:32,kmx64q,"I would hope we don’t go CB that early especially one with serious injury issues, CB is something we should look at day 3 I feel personally JC and Jones can hold the down fort for a year atleast"
9512,2020-12-30 20:55:16,kmx64q,"If there is a run on QBs and WRs I think the most likely pick(assuming we don't trade up/down) would be CB or OT.     
  
Like you mentioned we've got a lot of guys either aging out or hitting FA at CB in the near future and while the UDFA steals we've had have been numerous I don't think you can count on hitting on yet another one to fill those impending holes so I'd actually be quite fine with taking someone like Farley if he's there.  
  
OT we've got a few guys who can play the position but Wynn is always injured, Cannon is old and always dealing with an injury as well, Onwenu has been very good this year but I still think his best fit would be inside(replacing Thuney) so grabbing another, hopefully more durable, tackle makes a lot of sense to me.
  
Pitts doesn't seem like a BB TE and Freiermuth would be a bit of a reach this early in the first plus with the fact we just invested a couple 3rds at the position and don't know how they'll pan out yet I don't see us going TE.     

DT and LB are both big needs but DT I don't see a talent worth taking where we'll be picking(and honestly don't really see much worthy of a first round grade period) and outside of Parsons(who won't fall that far) a lot of the other top LBs are either undersized like JOK, Bolton, even Moses and/or more tail end of the first picks. Plus even if Bill decided to go less traditional LB we just grabbed Dugger who already fits that S/LB role.  
  
With the recent picks of Uche and Winovich at EDGE I don't think they'd be looking too much at the position but if they are it would likely be at guys a bit bigger who are a little more stout in the run. I haven't looked much at the position yet but from what I have Paye and Rousseau seem to be the main guys being talked about around where we'll pick and Paye seems more like Flowers(technician with abit more limited athletic ability) while Rousseau seems more like a more raw Chandler Jones(athletic but needing to work on his technique). While I loved Flowers I'm not sure I'd use a top 15 pick on a guy like him and while Rousseau seems to have a high ceiling I'm just worried about the bust potential given how often we see highly drafted DEs bust and how high(relative to where we normally pick) our pick is and wouldn't want to waste it."
9513,2020-12-30 18:19:45,kmx64q,Mac has only played with 1 NFL WR for over half the season this year. Metchie is going to need a full 4 years if he wants to actually get drafted above the 4th round. Najee definitely helps take the load off Mac no doubt.
9514,2020-12-30 07:07:31,kmx64q,Yea I agree these wide outs that we have never seem to get open and even when they do Cam can't throw the football properly.
9515,2020-12-30 18:21:08,kmx64q,"They need a player that can get them the ball first, I think QB is a priority for the Pats"
9516,2020-12-30 17:00:52,kmx64q,"> Cam isnt going to stay their forever

He's a great person, but he shouldn't be back, period."
9517,2020-12-30 16:17:46,kmx64q,"I never got this, we drafted 1, 1st rd WR in the last 10 years [Harry, late 1st], prior to that Dobson in the late 2nd. 

Patriots don't invest a lot into WRs in the draft. Most are second/third day picks."
9518,2021-01-02 08:10:06,kmx64q,Why? We don’t draft receivers early at all. For like 15 years we have not had a fuck to give about wide receiver as a position when drafting. Brandin Cooks was a recent stud we drafted... traded him.
9519,2021-01-02 08:17:43,kmx64q,"Belichick cares about getting the highest value for the least cost. This is his priority at all times. I must admit I don’t have a clue what the tape looks like for Trey Lance nor what his measurables look like, but I can’t see him reaching for Trey Lance. I have absolutely no idea  what he’s going to do but I’m certain he wants to avoid blowing his 1st or 2nd picks on a QB given the big holes at other groups. More likely he takes a flyer on a random Joe Blow who played lacrosse at a community college before transferring to Rutgers as a walk-on"
9520,2020-12-31 14:09:40,kmx64q,"The scout Dave Te Thomas from the Scout’s Honor Podcast brought it up quite a bit towards the end of last year. His track record wasn’t 100% (to be fair, no one’s is), but it was still better than most, and he was doing this for decades with a lot of connections. He passed away a few months ago, and that podcast has been posting a lot of his bold takes that ended up being right as a tribute. Now I don’t believe Lance is better than Trevor Lawrence like he did, but I can believe that Belichick would be interested in a small school QB that already plays in a pro style offense given all the small school players he’s drafted recently"
9521,2020-12-30 15:35:57,kmx64q,Kinda seems like a more athletic Kyle Van Noy doesn’t he?
9522,2020-12-31 18:38:23,kmx64q,"Sorry if it wasn't clear but this was specifically about the Pats. They really don't use outside receivers, and when they do it's a Brandon LaFell type of player. Brandin Cooks was solid in the offense his one year, but he always felt awkward. That's what Nkeal Harry was suppose to be last year, the finishing piece to the offense. They presumably had a great offensive line(injuries and Dave Andrews messed with that), RB(Sony was solid the year before plus White), Julian Edelman, Josh Gordon, and apparently Gronk because they were ""blindsided"" by his retirement. So Harry was suppose to be the last piece. 

Patriots primarily attack the middle of the field from the slot and TE position, so while I think Devonta Smith and Waddle can play the slot I don't think in the Patriots offense they are worth the pick, with a lot of other holes. I think someone like Amon-Ra St. Brown later in the draft is a better fit. Plus, you know, Pats need someone who can throw the ball more than 5 yards too."
9523,2020-12-30 14:12:23,kmx64q,I would assume someone else would trade up with them. Patriots have a history/tendency of trading down or out of the first (see last year) so its not far-fetched to see it again.
9524,2020-12-30 18:45:17,kmx64q,"NE, like most teams, try to address problems in FA to enable flexibility on draft day."
9525,2020-12-30 16:41:59,kmx64q,Kendrick would be a good pick. If they are able to not throw him in right away and instead ease him into having a big role he could really be if it from that
9526,2020-12-30 18:41:09,kmx64q,"That's usually true because the Pats have had more picks in that range due to trading back (or trading in general). I don't think we can make assumptions about first round priorities based on history either because since 2001 they have had only four picks in the top 20. 
2001 - DE/DT Richard Seymour  6
2003 - DE/DT Ty Warren  13  
2008 - LB Jerod Mayo 10  
2011 - T Nate Solder 17  

Furthermore, salary cap management may have affected the first three selections because they occured before the rookie wage scale was introduced."
9527,2020-12-30 18:24:48,kmx64q,Have to plan a year ahead
9528,2020-12-30 21:40:27,kmx64q,What QB will be available worth drafting?
9529,2020-12-30 23:38:59,kmx64q,"I mean, there are plenty of teams that at least get **SOME** production from their day 2/3 WR picks and plenty more that have at least drafted solid WRs on days 2/3."
9530,2020-12-31 19:42:07,kmx64q,Wasn’t chad Jackson a second?
9531,2021-01-02 14:30:06,kmx64q,"Pats traded for Brandin Cooks, NOLA drafted him."
9532,2020-12-31 17:50:24,kmx64q,Thanks for the response!
9533,2020-12-30 15:45:40,kmx64q,I think thats a pretty fair comparison. I have him firmly in the 1st round right now.
9534,2020-12-31 22:39:41,kmx64q,"I guess I just don't view the Patriots as having a rigid offensive philosophy. The previous system was suited to the previous personnel, which is obviously to their credit... but all of those guys are now either gone or significantly deteriorated. 

Seeing how little they have in terms of offensive personnel, IMO they have an opportunity to choose to build towards whatever system they wish, the most common and promising blueprints these days being SF/GB/LAR/Minny/Cleveland/Tennessee, and KC/Buffalo."
9535,2020-12-30 15:03:28,kmx64q,they usually don’t get a pick this high though
9536,2020-12-30 18:31:52,kmx64q,Sure but you shouldn’t look at future needs before current needs especially when you factor in Farleys injury history
9537,2020-12-31 19:47:15,kmx64q,"in 2006, which was 14 years ago."
9538,2020-12-30 15:59:52,kmx64q,"I think he’d fit in fine in NE then, I don’t think they’ll draft him at 14-15 though. I think if he ends up in NE it’ll be because they traded back or he fell to them in round 2"
9539,2020-12-30 15:11:57,kmx64q,Correct. The last time they were remotely close to this draft position they traded up not down.
9540,2020-12-30 15:17:33,kmx64q,"Sure, just this game seemed absolute sure they weren't going to trade out of their pick, and its pretty foolish to state that before the regular season is even over."
9541,2020-12-30 18:51:19,kmx64q,"Not necessarily Farley but I think CB is a priority position.

Saleh from  the 49ers is intriguing but I’m not convinced that NFL success is indicative of a great college coach. I dont like Brian Kelly and I think he is overrated.  I don’t know who else is out there that we can get but nobody checks all my boxes. If I had to pick a guy it would be Fickle but the G5 superstar has burnt us recently.

Herman and the team underperformed this year no question about it and no excuses. But like you said let’s see what Herman does with a new qb and his coordinators with a year behind them. And an actual spring camp. I know I said no excuses but I’m trying to look at having two new coordinators with no spring camp and not having the normal slate of tune-up games to be some upside going into next year for Herman and his crew. We’ll see. He’ll be running on a 6” leash."

9710,2020-12-30 21:44:55,kmwefg,eyyy I ordered the three pack after that thread lol. The bean sauce looks interesting and I love jerk so figured WHY NOT and smashed that order button
9711,2020-12-31 03:59:54,kmwefg,"Howd they sign up? Out of curiosity. 

Vaccine messaging has been dogshit."
9712,2020-12-31 03:05:39,kmwefg,I think is a good compromise while staying away from other people as much as possible.  Gotta take care of mentals too.
9713,2020-12-31 03:23:17,kmwefg,Make sure to wait a couple of weeks after they get it if you want to be extra careful. I read that it’s not completely effective until a couple of weeks after the first dose.
9714,2020-12-31 05:31:34,kmwefg,It humanized them a bit too much for my taste. For a second I almost viewed them as college students who were just excited about a fun experience instead of the demon spawn I'm sworn to root against.
9715,2020-12-31 01:44:16,kmwefg,"The first response tweet that showed up for me was the 9/11 and Pearl Harbor death count vs. yesterday's covid lol

Also must be nice to flaunt shit like that when one in seven Texans were suffering through food insecurity BEFORE covid (2019).

Edit- Interesting to see this comment voted to negative. Sucks that facts are facts, I guess..."
9716,2020-12-31 01:31:14,kmwefg,Fuckin /r/smoking tore that dude apart.
9717,2020-12-31 03:15:38,kmwefg,"Haha i poked fun at the idea to spur some convo and people hated it!

Not gonna lie, the man has done some serious work in the win column and recruiting Texas.  The playoff loses hurt, but i'd rather be there than the ole ""we are three plays from the big 12 championship!"""

9719,2020-12-31 04:52:58,kmwefg,The Red River Shootout is always a coin-flip and next year's game will probably be decided by one score either way.
9720,2020-12-31 04:45:38,kmwefg,"Don’t worry. Nobody will seriously think we have any chance, so we’ve got a great shot to win."
9721,2020-12-30 15:41:23,kmwefg,Yeah except they've won 6 straight big 12 championships and they've lost because they were in the college football playoff. It infuriates me.
9722,2020-12-30 15:35:21,kmwefg,"Back to back to back my dude, put some respect on Cards name"
9723,2020-12-30 06:24:58,kmwefg,you could argue anyone who doesn't do this is a fake fan
9724,2020-12-30 22:09:35,kmwefg,Are they better or worse than UTSA?
9725,2020-12-30 22:08:27,kmwefg,I’m sure they do. They have “turn over worthy plays” which includes throws that should have been intercepted.
9726,2020-12-30 17:35:27,kmwefg,Are you telling me Mike Golic’s impact players Jett Bush and Reiss Leitao aren’t gonna be preseason all big 12?

9732,2020-12-30 18:25:48,kmwefg,Hutzler is arguably the second best hire Herman has ever made behind Ash (maybe Giles too). He’s been a really pleasant surprise.
9733,2020-12-30 17:12:19,kmwefg,Overshown & Jaylen Ford 🌚
9734,2020-12-30 21:04:57,kmwefg,">chugging Kool aid

Implying you don't have an IV of burnt orange liquid in your arm."
9735,2020-12-30 20:03:58,kmwefg,I have overdosed on the kool aid and have absolutely no plans on cutting back
9736,2020-12-31 04:26:28,kmwefg,"I mean in the ""old days"" the SEC has been fairly dominant overall. At least in my time. I'm not that old though. Things have definitely fallen off it seems though. Did A&M joining the SEC curse them? I hope so."
9737,2020-12-30 19:59:21,kmwefg,Thanks! It really flew by. It was always my dream to go to UT and it came and went. On to the next chapter!
9738,2020-12-30 15:46:21,kmwefg,"Him and Hutzler are maybe the best assistant hires we’ve ever had, at least in my memory"
9739,2020-12-30 16:02:11,kmwefg,I’ve seen this story before. In 3 years Ash becomes the DC for USC.
9740,2020-12-30 16:29:45,kmwefg,Now I’m not saying we could beat the Steelers...
9741,2020-12-30 18:23:23,kmwefg,"Let's keep our eyes on the Big12 ship first, baby steps..."
9742,2020-12-30 22:57:29,kmwefg,mmm not disagreeing but he could've been a transfer candidate there as well
9743,2020-12-31 04:08:58,kmwefg,SEC SEC
9744,2020-12-31 01:31:34,kmwefg,"My mom is a badass and I am very proud of her and brag on her often lol

edited to add- /u/onacomputer has a badass mom too, but unrelated to this story"
9745,2020-12-30 15:15:28,kmwefg,220 yards and 3 scores isn't a problem even if he only gets 12 touches.
9746,2020-12-30 15:22:23,kmwefg,With those numbers who cares.
9747,2020-12-30 20:15:11,kmwefg,"I was speaking from a historical perspective, not just the past couple years. It's not like we beat down Texas State or UNT or a program on that level."
9748,2020-12-30 20:11:04,kmwefg,At least we didn’t make that 5-7 team look like world beaters and people were able to comment on the very noticeable talent gap.
9749,2020-12-30 15:47:24,kmwefg,[deleted]
9750,2020-12-31 01:30:48,kmwefg,Why would any SEC team want to play a non-SEC team? No other teams in any conference would survive so the only rational thing to do is not try when the opportunity to prove that statement presents itself
9751,2020-12-30 06:21:16,kmwefg,JC too
9752,2020-12-30 15:03:03,kmwefg,Fucking conspiracy theories man. Embarrassing.
9753,2020-12-30 20:44:52,kmwefg,This is the way
9754,2020-12-30 20:48:59,kmwefg,Links above budy.  About to order mine
9755,2020-12-30 22:37:04,kmwefg,*stares at Boosh jerseys in my closet sadly*
9756,2020-12-30 21:47:38,kmwefg,Same. I had to stop buying jerseys of active players. Now I just got for hall of famers.
9757,2020-12-30 20:45:33,kmwefg,https://www.dhgate.com/product/custom-mens-texas-longhorns-college-football/400344326.html?d1_page_num=1&dspm=pcen.sp.list.1.FciBFu4UNZ0UBWFNObwI&resource_id=400344326&scm_id=search.LIST...NCR|0|0.&skuAttr=9999:1003#s1-0-1;searl%7C1098412074:1
9758,2020-12-30 14:51:37,kmwefg,"Yeah, I've definitely been bad about water. Got back at it yesterday. Time to focus on some championship-level piss."
9759,2020-12-30 15:25:14,kmwefg,I’ve also noticed mine follow with stress as well. Take it easy my dude!
9760,2020-12-30 16:27:27,kmwefg,It had a good run. Now I can go full Odin. If only I got the wisdom in the tradeoff.
9761,2020-12-30 08:34:35,kmwefg,"Im guessing theres a handshake under the table with RoJo to give him reps. Its why he didnt bounce and didnt fuck our RB room because at the end of the day we have 2 healthy RBs + watson, Rojo leaves we go down to 2 with any injury including Ingram which happened. 

But i have no idea whats going on. we have the best RB in the nation just chillin"
9762,2020-12-30 15:23:17,kmwefg,"He’s only had 3 season to make that big “if” a little smaller, and has failed to do so."
9763,2020-12-30 06:44:06,kmwefg,"one time I ordered a buffalo burger and it was a fucking normal ass burger with buffalo wing sauce and I was so fucking pissed at myself 

but yes buffalo and bison are the same thing unless we are talking about fish, in which case a buffalo is like carp"
9764,2020-12-30 06:16:38,kmwefg,"Yes, yes, and I believe you."
9765,2020-12-31 01:39:15,kmwefg,fuck
9766,2020-12-30 18:58:26,kmwefg,"Agreed, at least for this year. Don’t fire a guy who we know has at least a high enough floor to have a winning record to replace him with someone who hasn’t been a consistent winner. If Herman pulls together some magic and gets LJ Johnson and other surprises, and does better next year when his staff has a full offseason, things could be different. If they’re not, then throw some money out."
9767,2020-12-30 16:51:54,kmwefg,Saying Herman can get an occasional playoff birth is a huge stretch.
9768,2020-12-30 20:22:04,kmwefg,"I feel like this is a false dichotomy. Strong wasn't just bad, he was terrible. 3 consecutive losing seasons at Texas is an anomoly. Just because Herman's outdoing that doesn't mean we should be content with the past several years. Texas can and should aim better; this ain't Baylor or Tech.

I also feel that the odds of Herman backing into the playoffs are pretty low as long as Riley is in Norman."
9769,2020-12-30 23:28:56,kmwefg,McCoy and Ash were pretty easy too
9770,2020-12-30 22:17:45,kmwefg,That jerk was calling to me but I just went with the hot sauce for now. I prob should’ve gone with the variety pack tbh
9771,2020-12-31 04:32:07,kmwefg,"mom got a notification on her phone about our county doing sign ups for 1b, I think from a local news app"
9772,2020-12-31 03:45:37,kmwefg,"oh yeah, that was my plan. Only after they got both doses"
9773,2020-12-31 01:46:23,kmwefg,"Yeah, he doesn't give a shit about the peasants."
9774,2020-12-31 01:45:19,kmwefg,Rightly so.
9775,2020-12-30 15:48:42,kmwefg,Minor details
9776,2020-12-30 17:34:13,kmwefg,Don't know how I forgot him.
9777,2020-12-30 17:12:36,kmwefg,We’re gonna switch Overshown all the way from a safety to a d-lineman in 2 seasons?
9778,2020-12-30 19:01:21,kmwefg,Yeah he turned that group around. We thought they'd be our biggest weakness on D
9779,2020-12-30 17:43:29,kmwefg,Yeah. To be honest that whole from 7 on D looked great together.
9780,2020-12-30 16:06:06,kmwefg,"Well, unlike our last few 1st year great DCs, Ash has a resume of being a top tier DC"
9781,2020-12-30 16:04:55,kmwefg,True but I feel like Orlando lacked the development we are seeing under Ash.
9782,2020-12-30 16:33:27,kmwefg,But I'm also not *not* saying that we could.
9783,2020-12-30 19:11:42,kmwefg,Hey we play down to our competition (as both a longhorn and a steeler fan). I’d be shocked if that game didn’t come down to a last second field goal.
9784,2020-12-31 01:41:00,kmwefg,gracias
9785,2020-12-30 21:20:21,kmwefg,Fair.
9786,2020-12-30 21:20:33,kmwefg,Absolutely.
9787,2020-12-30 15:54:18,kmwefg,"Yeah, I'm just curious as to why he had to step back last night when many have speculated that he has been playing hurt all season. 

I think Sam should move on, but I want to know if this is just wear and tear or something more serious that could affect his career."
9788,2020-12-30 16:13:24,kmwefg,The love 💕between Sam and Herman is strong so never say never
9789,2020-12-30 08:20:59,kmwefg,whooooo?
9790,2020-12-30 15:36:48,kmwefg,"I figured it was likely stress or caffeine. I've been taking in more caffeine, but stress hasn't been an issue, so hydration it is!"
9791,2020-12-30 15:26:44,kmwefg,That's what makes me so skeptical of keeping Herman on. He hasn't shown a lot of coaching flexibility (other than playing down/up to an opponent) or lessons learned. It seems as if change (personnel or tactics) have to be forced upon him.
9792,2020-12-30 13:57:50,kmwefg,"What did the dad carp say to his son as he left for school?

Bison."
9793,2020-12-30 19:03:10,kmwefg,Occasional Big 12 championship berth more like it
9794,2020-12-30 17:01:06,kmwefg,"Fair. I just meant I think it's likely that he will occasionally fall into a great season and (unless something changes) will regularly be above average but not great. 

We were so bad before he got here though. Strong was 16-21 overall, 12-15 in conference, and 0-1 in bowls. We fired him because we wanted to stop being terrible at football. Herman is 32-18 overall, 22-13 in conference, and 4-0 in bowls. Thats not great, but if we fire him, it'll be because we want to be great instead of good. Which is a fair thing to want (I certainly want to be in the CCG every year) but it's a riskier decision."
9795,2020-12-31 03:48:04,kmwefg,Sounds like you’ll be good to go then. Can’t wait for my grandparents to get the vaccine.
9796,2020-12-30 15:50:13,kmwefg,Sorry I just see that Kyle Umlang guy post that shit and it pisses me off lol
9797,2020-12-30 17:13:15,kmwefg,"We have the technology, we can build him. Faster, stronger, bigger."
9798,2020-12-30 19:12:25,kmwefg,Getting DMO to buy in on the position change is honestly borderline miraculous.
9799,2020-12-31 03:03:27,kmwefg,Great HS fight song
9800,2020-12-30 21:40:18,kmwefg,🤘🏽
9801,2020-12-30 20:06:34,kmwefg,"Ostensibly, the team doctors pulled Sam. I don’t know what he did during the game that made it so that he could start pre-game and practice, but not play 2 more quarters."
9802,2020-12-30 16:00:39,kmwefg,“Career”
9803,2020-12-30 12:07:22,kmwefg,Sir Jose Canseco
9804,2020-12-30 19:27:37,kmwefg,"His coaching decisions, including playing upperclassman far more than he should have, directly lead to us *not* making the Big XII Championship this season."
9805,2020-12-30 17:18:29,kmwefg,It’s funny as a joke but when he flexes that stuff in all seriousness it’s actually embarrassing
9806,2020-12-30 17:22:50,kmwefg,For only $6M
9807,2020-12-30 19:57:08,kmwefg,Yep I’m a fan of his and Ash. DB’s seemed to improve over the year too.
9808,2020-12-30 19:56:44,kmwefg,Indeed yes
9809,2020-12-30 17:52:26,kmwefg,Absolute cringe
9810,2020-12-30 17:27:54,kmwefg,Call the boosters and tell them we can have another first round LB picked. They’ll make it happen
9811,2020-12-30 20:02:21,kmwefg,"I’ve always thought the 2 most difficult positions to coach would be o-line and DBs, and since he didn’t even have an off-season, I’m willing to give him a pass on the secondary having some struggles this season."
9812,2020-12-30 18:52:22,kmwbsy,This is an amazing shit post. Well done OP.
9813,2020-12-30 14:31:23,kmwbsy,"That's was great, really fun read! Thank you!"
9814,2020-12-30 06:30:06,kmwbsy,THAT'S A HUGE HIT RIGHT THERE
9815,2021-01-02 00:04:34,kmwbsy,Amazing

9829,2021-03-02 23:29:20,kmvghm,Ooh so many people
9830,2020-12-30 07:50:34,kmvghm,Why should it be limited to the surfaces of planets? It can probably appear in any four dimensional spacetime.
9831,2020-12-30 07:52:56,kmvghm,"I bet there's going to be a battle coming up and the audience will be surprised to learn Wallace figured out how to enchant Regina's wings so she _can_ fly.

Or he'll apply the technique of growing Val's hair to Regina's wings so they're actually proportional and capable of flight."
9832,2020-12-30 07:42:40,kmvghm,she could probably jump up to road level from a raised position.
9833,2020-12-30 07:45:47,kmvghm,"pretty sure the only thing cas could really learn from is the power storage, the rest is probably inferior to our tech. But no sane engineer fiddles with those while powered. holy grail is still self aware ai with personality. I would have aimed to bring more of those."
9834,2020-12-30 09:48:56,kmvghm,"Well you got me there. I just wasn't aware we had confirmation of this from this or the other story.

I suppose the mist is magical in nature, and *appears* random, but it probably doesn't appear on Earth in timelines adjacent to ours without intending to pick someone or something up, so maybe it appears on space stations as long as there's someone there for it."
9835,2020-12-30 14:45:52,kmvghm,">*Should you desire the use of Mind and Body magic to ensure that your household is obedient, meeting your standards of beauty, that shall also be your right.*

With body modification magic on the table I honestly expect a deal in the future for Regina to get arms at least, be able to care for herself.  Idk who that deal will be with, but (probably) some creep out there who specializes in serious body mod magic has something Wally wants- knowledge and the ability to help one of his friends."
9836,2020-12-30 18:32:09,kmvghm,"Those wings would have to be truly massive (at least 20+ metre wing span) just to get lift and the amount of energy needed to do that is simply not feasible. There is a reason birds have hollow bones. 

Hands instead of wings might be more in line with this reality at least."
9837,2020-12-30 09:39:30,kmvghm,I like this idea.
9838,2020-12-30 13:38:04,kmvghm,"I mean nah the sensors are probably at least worth a peek, plus whatever's running the musculature is much better than our own shit"
9839,2020-12-30 13:30:35,kmvghm,"I mean, the hotel was completely empty and took a chunk of underground with it. But the dump truck that followed Wallace in didn't even have the courtesy to bring the road along with it.

And our favourite bespectacled Canuck was 40 feet off the ground because of a similar occurrence of rudely not bringing the road along with."
9840,2020-12-30 18:06:04,kmvghm,"I'm expecting something more along the lines of either a necklace with the materials to cast spells to move things, or a An enchanted necklace with the same spell. Just so she can work without hands. If the enchantment is strong enough, she could even use it to fly"
9841,2020-12-31 09:06:47,kmvghm,"True, but magic was always going to be the more likely solution to flight."
9842,2020-12-30 14:03:22,kmvghm,"Cant say for her sensors, but going off the plug-and-play bit in the snowy village I think the tech is fully mechanic or pneumatic with on-site gas compressors. Plug&play is just utterly incompatible with actual muscles due to lacking leverage.

When we go off the rails with tech, her mobility could be powered by shielded electromagnetism. It's fast, its extremely powerfull (strong) and it can be redlined at the expense of destructive heat generation and power-draw."
9843,2020-12-30 14:43:24,kmvghm,"Wasn't our favorite bespectacled Canuck also moving at highway speeds when he emerged 40 feet off the ground?

I would think miss Sphinx emerging on the ground at orbital speeds would not be having a very good time. Perhaps the mist takes into account the speed relative to the object you are standing/moving on, or perhaps the speed relative to whatever the person being transported considers stationary ground.

The mist dropping an entire O'Neill cylinder moving at orbital speed on something would be pretty spectacular...

Or perhaps the mist is sentient and was just being a bit of a dick when it fired our favorite Canuck at a forest."
9844,2020-12-30 14:28:24,kmvghm,"In the mists defense, that particular mad genius(moron) kind of drove OFF the road, so bringing it with him wouldn't have helped much."
9845,2021-01-18 01:51:37,kmvghm,I don't think the hotel was completely empty.  Remember the dump truck still had the seatbelt done up like it was being used.  Also there's no way a hotel would EVER be completely empty like that.  So what this means is that either all the people are either killed by the mist or left behind by the mist...in mid air on the upper floors or the truck at road speeds.  Also the gas station had no people in it but the door was unlocked and it didn't seem to have any signs of occupation.
9846,2020-12-31 17:24:20,kmvghm,"I distinctly remember amity mentioning something about a fusion battery, so mechanical or pneumatic workings would be unlikely. She'd be practically glowing with waste heat from that energy transfer."
9847,2020-12-30 16:58:44,kmvghm,"He was going offramp speeds, IIRC."
9848,2021-03-31 22:54:12,kmvghm,"Late dum-dum here, but who is the canadian with glasses?"
9849,2021-01-18 02:41:43,kmvghm,"You bring up a point I'd been thinking about for a while now. It's entirely possible that the mist is not a ""cut and paste"" but actually a ""copy and paste""."
9850,2020-12-31 17:41:47,kmvghm,"considering fusion happens at million degrees, she should already."
9851,2020-12-30 17:54:54,kmvghm,"Reread it after writing my comments, IIRC he was on an overpass but driving quite slowly because of the storm accompanying the mist making visibility quite bad."
9852,2021-04-02 19:59:00,kmvghm,"See: 'Oh this has not gone well', by the same author.

Pretty nice, but I'd say that the author has improved /a lot/. It's very similar to Meet the Freak, sort of a precursor in another part of the multiverse. Fun if you can't wait for the next episode of MtF, but definitely less polished."
9853,2021-06-08 00:33:14,kmvghm,"The no-cloning theorem would stop that from being possible though, granted they could just be VERY similar to the copy but they difference would still add up, say its only 1 in a thousand- million, even, it'd still be about 2million errors in the average human body, and I _think_ Wallace _might_ be a _tad bit_ bigger than the average human.

(Err, the no cloning theroem suggests that no two particles can ever be identical.
Say atom of sphynx A gets transported/copied to the new place, atom of sphynx A would suddenly ressemble atoms of sphynx B.
Which would cause atom of sphynx B to ressemble atom of sphynx C etc etc
Not a perfect explanation but ehhhhh you get the point lol

Oh, and this only a/effects atoms that are being cloned, not living things. Doesn't feel like it needs saying but there are some people out there who are denser than depleted uranium (myself included))"
9854,2021-01-01 00:00:43,kmvghm,"It happens at millions of degrees *or* at incredibly high pressures. Either way, there's some super tech we're so fast behind it's laughable."
9855,2020-12-30 18:12:11,kmvghm,"So really, the Banestorm was just a dick for not bringing the road."
9856,2021-06-08 01:07:35,kmvghm,"True, but the no-cloning theorem doesn't account for separate universes."
9857,2021-01-01 06:42:33,kmvghm,"but its still electric and one of the defining points of any *punk is alien application of concepts not fully fitting, even more so for electropunk (frankenstein for example)

i just hope thngw wont use electromotors for the actuators since they have a high wear and tear ratio and are bad at shock absorbing"
9858,2021-06-08 01:26:21,kmvghm,"Apart from the universe where it does :lennyface:

Besides, we have no actual evidence that this is a different dimension/universe/reality (take your pick lol) It could simply be somewhere else in the universe. 

It's easy to forget how big the universe truly is, but somewhere out there probably exists an exact copy of earth but, idk, Casey Lee Williams didn't sing in RWBY.  
(Which would be an actual life-threatening disaster, Brand New Day and Red Like Roses II are practically pancake material)

It's not impossible to assume that this is just somewhere in our universe (lets call it universe Alpha) exists the Dungeons and Dragons nightmare that happened to the sphynx, while in different galaxy Amity was created.
No-cloning theorem applies in this situation _alone_.



If they ARE from other universes then, yeh, no-cloning theorm can take the finger. But the problem of physics also comes into play.

Physics in Alpha works on the laws of conservation.
Physics in Beta might DEPEND on conservation not existing.

Ofc with theoretically infinite universes it doesn't matter much but the point still stands?
(Was there even a point lol....?)"
9859,2021-06-08 02:07:36,kmvghm,I dunno. Author has been suspiciously mute on the topic as a whole.
9860,2021-06-08 02:11:41,kmvghm,"Probably factors into the final plot somehow :shrug:
Or so he can see people talk about it, I know one of my friends loves seeing debates and is a tad bit upset when something that the fanbase has been working on is given a clear cut answer."
9861,2020-12-30 04:37:34,kmv3wj,"/u/BlankBalak, I have found some errors in your post:

 > “nothing more ~~then~~ [**than**] a relationship”

 > “Even if ~~your~~ [**you're**] a little”

I consider this comment of you, BlankBalak, erroneous; it should say “nothing more ~~then~~ [**than**] a relationship” and “Even if ~~your~~ [**you're**] a little” instead. Unlike the adverb ‘then’, ‘than’ compares. ‘Your’ is possessive; ‘you're’ means ‘you are’.

9875,2020-12-31 02:10:05,kmuz8d,We literaly have not got 1 rebound when powell is in all game btw.
9876,2020-12-31 03:44:35,kmuz8d,Luka will get the criticism and fair enough. He looks very out of shape and passive... but man does the supporting cast look awful. Richardson missing that wide open layup summed it up.
9877,2020-12-31 03:41:07,kmuz8d,"Rick commented this week when asked about Luka’s conditioning 

> DALLAS - Rather than engaged in a non-productive argument about the early-season conditioning level of young superstar Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavs coach Rick Carlisle is taking a higher road - and a wiser one.

> “He’s learning,'' Carlisle told us on Tuesday, ""that greatness is a year-round proposition. You've got to really bust your tail to keep yourself in the best form possible all year long.""

> ""There is talk about his conditioning and those kinds of things,'' Carlisle conceded in our interview on 105.3 The Fan. ""It's ongoing, but as we move forward, I see more maturity.''"

9917,2020-12-31 01:56:29,kmuz8d,Team is overthinking all of these wide open 3s. Stop hesitating.
9918,2020-12-31 01:57:10,kmuz8d,We are either dead eye from 3 or we just fuckin suck. There’s no in between.
9919,2020-12-31 02:42:48,kmuz8d,Luka not happy about going out.
9920,2020-12-31 02:53:07,kmuz8d,Hornets bench has 42 pts at 82 fg% and 7/9 from three. Something’s gotta give
9921,2020-12-31 03:07:22,kmuz8d,dwight powell has to go
9922,2020-12-31 03:12:35,kmuz8d,Please stop shooting 3's Luka. There I said it.
9923,2020-12-31 03:15:07,kmuz8d,1 game after the 50 point win and the Fire Rick comments are back. Lovely.
9924,2020-12-31 03:26:23,kmuz8d,"Just checked. Lukas 4th game last season: 

12/4/5 with 25/16/62 shooting splits. 

While starting about the same with the 1st 3 games as this season. It happens."
9925,2020-12-31 03:42:35,kmuz8d,"Put Luka back in, he needs the reps"
9926,2020-12-31 03:45:06,kmuz8d,This is probably Lukas worst game yet
9927,2020-12-31 02:47:12,kmuz8d,Powell a net minus 16.
9928,2020-12-30 08:07:01,kmuz8d,JRich is listed as questionable.
9929,2020-12-31 01:48:02,kmuz8d,"Don't encourage him, Charlotte!"
9930,2020-12-31 01:48:05,kmuz8d,No way someone jumped at Powell’s fake
9931,2020-12-31 01:49:07,kmuz8d,who falls for a powell pump fake lol
9932,2020-12-31 01:56:58,kmuz8d,"Luka should have like 6 assists rn lol, make the damn shot!!"
9933,2020-12-31 02:09:11,kmuz8d,Just another night at the aac where the away team that typically isnt a very reliable shooting team is gonna throw up some dumb shots and make half of them
9934,2020-12-31 02:45:38,kmuz8d,"Was that third Doncic foul really a foul? Legitimate question, not trying to be sarcastic."
9935,2020-12-31 02:56:06,kmuz8d,I’m still crying at the fact that we all collectively laughed when Powell bricked that suspenseful 3
9936,2020-12-31 03:46:25,kmuz8d,Man they kicked our ass with Hayward being dogshit
9937,2020-12-31 03:52:50,kmuz8d,Wtf theres two of them with the same haircut haha I thought they were the same player
9938,2020-12-30 15:27:45,kmuz8d,"I'm excited to actually watch Lamelo in a game, I've only seen the few crazy passing highlights on /r/nba.

&#x200B;

Also hope JRich is good to play, but it would be understandable not to play him being this early in the season if he feels slightly off."
9939,2020-12-31 01:46:33,kmuz8d,Luka is moving well! He's improved a lot conditioning wise over the past week!
9940,2020-12-31 01:47:59,kmuz8d,Powell's shot fake worked!
9941,2020-12-31 01:48:44,kmuz8d,Powell pumpfake god
9942,2020-12-31 01:49:35,kmuz8d,Immediately 50 comments about biting on Powell’s pump fake 😂
9943,2020-12-31 01:56:04,kmuz8d,The Luka bricks are getting real ugly
9944,2020-12-31 01:56:24,kmuz8d,Was that a Harp f bomb?
9945,2020-12-31 02:29:08,kmuz8d,"Nawwww...fuck that blown gimmie by Powell, ruined an incredible assist"
9946,2020-12-31 02:29:54,kmuz8d,The fact that they’re bench has literally not missed a god damn shot is really chapping my ass
9947,2020-12-31 02:57:20,kmuz8d,"Luka has not even played bad besides those two 3s, just a bit too passive for my liking, needs to forget that LeBron mentality when your team is playing like ass and go killer mode."
9948,2020-12-31 03:06:56,kmuz8d,Random people will still tell us to ‘stay positive’ and ‘stop whining’. The team is DOG. SHIT. We can whine if we want
9949,2020-12-31 03:08:15,kmuz8d,Honestly how many wide open shots have we bricked in a row
9950,2020-12-31 03:12:21,kmuz8d,If Hayward was even decent tonight we might have been the first team ever to win a game by 50 then lose their next game by 50.
9951,2020-12-31 03:13:58,kmuz8d,"I'm all in for Luka start shooting a fuck ton of 3s. Tha game is going bad, if he can at least start making some he might get out of the slump"
9952,2020-12-31 03:16:55,kmuz8d,"Luka is in easily the worst slump of his career holy shit, like ~10% from 3? That's fucking atrocious."
9953,2020-12-31 03:19:36,kmuz8d,Luka is missing the rim by like 4 feet when he shoots.
9954,2020-12-31 03:21:12,kmuz8d,Team shouldn't need KP to not get blown out by the Hornets. Team is mad inconsistent
9955,2020-12-31 03:25:14,kmuz8d,u/legend_killer7 said it best Lukas probably gonna say postgame ‘we shot bad shots’ and then next game keep shooting these bad shots
9956,2020-12-31 03:26:26,kmuz8d,"Just run Luka-Terry-Green-Bey-Boban for the entire 4th and let Luka shoot until he makes something
it would be more entertaining than this whatever it is"
9957,2020-12-31 03:30:44,kmuz8d,"James Johnson has won my respect though, dude always gives it 100."
9958,2020-12-31 03:34:32,kmuz8d,Josh Green is at least playing well
9959,2020-12-31 03:43:30,kmuz8d,Sign Dennis Rodman
9960,2020-12-31 03:46:27,kmuz8d,Lmao wait what did he say
9961,2020-12-31 03:52:29,kmuz8d,LeBron needs to do us a solid and give Luka a long serious talk about keeping up his conditioning and fitness moving forward.
9962,2020-12-31 03:55:08,kmuz8d,Johnson probably said his haircut sucks
9963,2020-12-31 03:55:52,kmuz8d,Surprised it took until game four until James Johnson got thrown out of a game.
9964,2020-12-31 02:52:13,kmuz8d,"*ball coming off rim*

Powell: 👉👈 it for me?

Any opposing player: grabs ball"
9965,2020-12-31 03:19:45,kmuz8d,I’m starting to wonder if Silas was the actual genius behind our offense last year
9966,2020-12-30 16:51:47,kmuz8d,it seems like the clippers beat down was a week ago
9967,2020-12-31 01:48:05,kmuz8d,DWIGHT PUMP FAKE
9968,2020-12-31 01:48:32,kmuz8d,DPs only move finally worked 😤😤😤😤
9969,2020-12-31 01:49:01,kmuz8d,Dear lord someone bit hard on a Dwight Powell pump fake.
9970,2020-12-31 01:49:02,kmuz8d,"Bruh, why TF are they full speed contesting a Powell 3 lmao? Someone didn't read the scouting report?"
9971,2020-12-31 01:49:33,kmuz8d,You already know the guy that bit on Powell’s pump fake is about to be benched lmao
9972,2020-12-31 01:50:37,kmuz8d,"Wake up.

See Dwight Powell pump fake from the 3pt line.

Day ruined...

Wait it actually worked? 

(Visible confusion)"
9973,2020-12-31 02:00:31,kmuz8d,Y’all are so fucking negative lol
9974,2020-12-31 02:05:32,kmuz8d,Suck a dick refs. Fuck y’all.
9975,2020-12-31 02:08:33,kmuz8d,"What the fuck does powell have on rick btw?
How you going to take wcs out after 2 min when he has done more in those 2 than fucking powell has this whole fucking season?!"
9976,2020-12-31 02:09:41,kmuz8d,"Three chances at a shot for them at the end of the quarter. 

Oof."
9977,2020-12-31 02:09:47,kmuz8d,Charlotte aren’t missing wtf. They can’t honestly keep it up
9978,2020-12-31 02:20:18,kmuz8d,"This totally feels like a last season's AAC game.

And folks, that's not a good thing."
9979,2020-12-31 02:20:34,kmuz8d,second time this game refs have gotten the out of bounds call wrong
9980,2020-12-31 02:22:28,kmuz8d,James Johnson’s playmaking is something I didn’t know he had
9981,2020-12-31 02:30:18,kmuz8d,Lakers game vibes on rebounds
9982,2020-12-31 02:30:22,kmuz8d,Lol I swear Luka plays good defense and somehow players still always score on him wtf
9983,2020-12-31 02:31:10,kmuz8d,Our centers have 0 rebounds in over 1.5 quarters lmao
9984,2020-12-31 02:31:11,kmuz8d,how come they can never make these open shots from Luka
9985,2020-12-31 02:31:27,kmuz8d,Powell getting destroyed on the boards by lamelo is not a good look
9986,2020-12-31 02:38:13,kmuz8d,"Even against the clippers we slowed down once Powell was on. I backed him at the start of the season but he's a massive net negative on both ends, he might just be the worst starter in the league right now."
9987,2020-12-31 02:39:32,kmuz8d,Imagine destroying a team that is still a good team even without their best player by 51 at their place then following that up with this bullshit at your home opener.
9988,2020-12-31 02:42:02,kmuz8d,THJ is easily our best player this game (along with Maxi).
9989,2020-12-31 02:45:13,kmuz8d,Damn doe doe just keeps missing Those wide 3’s
9990,2020-12-31 02:46:23,kmuz8d,"Hornets just playing much harder than the Mavs on both ends. Seeing how everyone makes multiple rotations out to shooters, and multiple players crashing the boards. Compete level a tier higher"
9991,2020-12-31 02:49:40,kmuz8d,"Energy is biggest difference in this game. The way we played against the clippers is the same way the hornets are playing.

Might wanna throw in some zone D against this team, and see if we can get a stop cause nobody seems to be able to stop thir 1 on 1."
9992,2020-12-31 02:52:37,kmuz8d,"Just want to go on the record to state the obvious: I’m truly not worried about Luka. He’s got the potential to be an all-time great. He’s certainly got things he needs to improve, but this is the fourth game of his third season. Take a beat."
9993,2020-12-31 02:58:41,kmuz8d,Attention to all Opposing teams: just simply drive at Powell. You will either get fouled or you’ll make the bucket. No worries and have a good day
9994,2020-12-31 03:02:43,kmuz8d,42 seconds and already a timeout AFTER A HALF TIME BREAK. Pathetic
9995,2020-12-31 03:05:01,kmuz8d,Really Luka
9996,2020-12-31 03:08:42,kmuz8d,Can't wait for all the positivity comments about how 'toxic' everyone is and why no one should be concerned at all
9997,2020-12-31 03:10:43,kmuz8d,"Pretty simple we scare nobody other than Pandemic P... Gotta stop this analytical 3 chucking and get to the fucking line, make fts, slow the game down. You know basic shit you learn as a kid"
9998,2020-12-31 03:13:02,kmuz8d,Why are we just chucking 3’s on offense? No movement at all
9999,2020-12-31 03:16:58,kmuz8d,"Team didn't care to show up and play so I'm not gonna keep watching.

See y'all New Years against Miami."
10000,2020-12-31 03:18:23,kmuz8d,"Not our night. Predictable after delivering an historic beatdown on our nemeses. We'll be fine. JRich and James Johnson were awesome pickups, KP still coming."
10001,2020-12-31 03:23:23,kmuz8d,This is the problem with building your entire team around 3 point shooting. If your shot is off you’re getting blown out
10002,2020-12-31 03:24:26,kmuz8d,"this is legitimately one of the coldest stretches of basketball i’ve ever seen for a team, we can’t hit anything"
10003,2020-12-31 03:29:31,kmuz8d,This loss better wake this team up. You can't just say you lost to the title favorites when you looked awful against the Lakers again when you play this bad again tonight.
10004,2020-12-31 03:51:53,kmuz8d,And boban immediately produces
10005,2020-12-31 03:53:30,kmuz8d,JJ the only one who took this game serious
10006,2020-12-31 03:58:08,kmuz8d,"I love having some bite, really don’t mind jj getting in some scraps now and again"
10007,2020-12-30 05:31:45,kmuz8d,I’m feelin a Doncic triple-double is in the making.
10008,2020-12-31 03:43:24,kmuz8d,"we’ll be fine. there’s no way this team will shoot this poorly from basically everywhere, including FTs, the whole season. it’s just too early."
10009,2020-12-31 04:01:32,kmuz8d,"WCS 10 minutes, Powell 24 minutes 🤢"
10010,2020-12-31 01:49:00,kmuz8d,Lol he fell for the Powell pump fake
10011,2020-12-31 01:49:04,kmuz8d,No way he bited on Powell can't believe it 😁😁😁😁
10012,2020-12-31 01:51:01,kmuz8d,Holy shit Luka has been playing some really good defense the past few games. He’s improved his free throws and his defense? Damn man he’s really out here trying to be the goat.
10013,2020-12-31 01:56:53,kmuz8d,Man how many wide open 3s of luka passes can they brick?
10014,2020-12-31 01:57:46,kmuz8d,Hornets fan coming to say your broadcast crew is such a delight. Really just appreciate the game and compliment whatever team or players  makes a good play.
10015,2020-12-31 01:57:51,kmuz8d,Man luka is dishing it out but nobody eatin
10016,2020-12-31 01:58:55,kmuz8d,I have a bad feeling about this game.
10017,2020-12-31 02:04:42,kmuz8d,Oh it’s gonna be one of those nights refs? Come on man
10018,2020-12-31 02:05:28,kmuz8d,How is that not a foul? Looked like he was a six year old playing whack a mole
10019,2020-12-31 02:06:46,kmuz8d,fuck these refs
10020,2020-12-31 02:08:57,kmuz8d,Wtf where are the techs on the entire Hornets bench? They did the exact same thing James did for his tech
10021,2020-12-31 02:09:01,kmuz8d,of course they hit every single bullshit heave...
10022,2020-12-31 02:09:15,kmuz8d,"Hornets are hitting the dumbest shots, and have refs backing them. But we're still there. hopefully this all evens out."
10023,2020-12-31 02:10:00,kmuz8d,What an ugly quarter we just played
10024,2020-12-31 02:14:44,kmuz8d,James Johnson is so underrated
10025,2020-12-31 02:20:27,kmuz8d,I miss blowouts :(
10026,2020-12-31 02:21:02,kmuz8d,I remember someone telling me James Johnson likely wouldn’t crack the rotation. He’s becoming one of my favorites
10027,2020-12-31 02:21:38,kmuz8d,James Johnson is actually our second best passer
10028,2020-12-31 02:23:22,kmuz8d,James Johnson is a DAWG
10029,2020-12-31 02:24:29,kmuz8d,Only Mavs can make players taken in a salary dump from trades into good role players.Johnson looked good so far into the season.
10030,2020-12-31 02:28:57,kmuz8d,Not my favorite stat but Powell with a game worst -12 plus/minus.
10031,2020-12-31 02:29:14,kmuz8d,Hornets shooting is unsustainable. Our defense isnt great but they're hitting everything they're throwing up
10032,2020-12-31 02:30:23,kmuz8d,Luka plays good defense but they seem to hit every tough shots.
10033,2020-12-31 02:31:11,kmuz8d,Powell cant fucking rebund anything HIW IS THIS FUCKING BUM IN THE NBA?!!??!?!
10034,2020-12-31 02:36:34,kmuz8d,"Luka is not getting to and finishing at the rim nearly as well so far this year. He's generating tons of good passes though, but he needs to drive and score more"
10035,2020-12-31 02:39:31,kmuz8d,If this trip is a flagrant foul Cuban fixing to get fined... they didn’t even call one against Morris in the bubble
10036,2020-12-31 02:46:00,kmuz8d,Well thank god for Kleber. Seems like him and THJ were the only ones to show up so far. We REALLY need better rebounding.
10037,2020-12-31 02:46:58,kmuz8d,Everybody switch to the other side of the couch... we need some different energy
10038,2020-12-31 02:47:54,kmuz8d,We’re just missing wide open shots wtf. Their defense isn’t even good
10039,2020-12-31 03:11:09,kmuz8d,SHOOT MID RANGERS LUKA PLEASE I BEG YOU
10040,2020-12-31 03:11:16,kmuz8d,"I will always love this team, but tonight I think I'll just turn it off. See y'all on Friday."
10041,2020-12-31 03:12:15,kmuz8d,Can. We. Get. A. FUCKING. REBOUND. FUCKKKK
10042,2020-12-31 03:14:52,kmuz8d,"i don’t like how we’re turning 100% into a “live by the three, die by the three” kind of team."
10043,2020-12-31 03:20:59,kmuz8d,How does Luka get worse at 3 point shooting as he spends more time in the NBA?
10044,2020-12-31 03:22:47,kmuz8d,what happened to Luka's 3 point shooting form?? He's literally not jumping at all when shooting it
10045,2020-12-31 03:24:23,kmuz8d,I'm fully convinced that rim is cursed. ***NOTHING*** is going in at this point
10046,2020-12-31 03:30:45,kmuz8d,I still think we need to run 5 out at all times with Luka on the floor. If I see KP playing at the 4 when he comes back with DP at the 5 I might have a stroke
10047,2020-12-31 03:32:33,kmuz8d,Skip Bayless taking notes
10048,2020-12-31 03:39:36,kmuz8d,Can’t miss 12 free throws in a game.
10049,2020-12-31 03:46:03,kmuz8d,Took Harp 90 minutes to apologize for his fbomb
10050,2020-12-31 03:49:42,kmuz8d,"The bench actually has been solid, its the starters (minus THJ) who have sucked ass"
10051,2020-12-31 04:01:17,kmuz8d,Kind of confused by our draft picks. Seeing Roby ball out only adds fuel to the fire.
10052,2020-12-31 04:01:49,kmuz8d,Iwundu needs to be part of the rotation. He looks good when he gets on the floor
10053,2020-12-31 02:46:21,kmuz8d,Luka gets in his own head way too much
10054,2020-12-31 02:53:21,kmuz8d,Not sure if this is a game thread or a postgame thread.
10055,2020-12-31 02:55:32,kmuz8d,It's one of the great mysteries of the universe: what Carlisle sees in Dwight Powell that the rest of humanity doesn't.
10056,2020-12-31 03:26:05,kmuz8d,"This is going to be Doncic worst season since like ever. Just hope he learns his lection, chilling on the sofa and playing video games doesn't prepare you for an NBA season."
10057,2020-12-31 03:23:06,kmuz8d,"delete this game thread please, just read that someone would rather have trae young"
10058,2020-12-30 18:20:31,kmuz8d,I want to see the same defensive effort as last game and I'll be good!
10059,2020-12-30 21:24:55,kmuz8d,Let's get that 3 point shooting percentage up for Luka starting tonight. I can feel a good night is coming!
10060,2020-12-31 01:41:41,kmuz8d,Damn! The floor looks NICE.
10061,2020-12-31 01:43:15,kmuz8d,"These jerseys, this court. 😍"
10062,2020-12-31 01:47:01,kmuz8d,"Hayward has good hair, damn."
10063,2020-12-31 01:49:00,kmuz8d,I’ve never seen anyone bite on a Powell pump fake
10064,2020-12-31 01:56:25,kmuz8d,Luka definitely should have passed up on that 3.
10065,2020-12-31 01:56:55,kmuz8d,Did Harp just drop an f bomb?! 😂😂
10066,2020-12-31 01:59:18,kmuz8d,Luka's 3 point shooting is concerning.
10067,2020-12-31 02:03:58,kmuz8d,WCS and Maxi are so much better than Powell
10068,2020-12-31 02:07:03,kmuz8d,Nah those refs should be fined for shit like this. This league is becoming beyond unwatchable
10069,2020-12-31 02:08:26,kmuz8d,every fucking night with these refs
10070,2020-12-31 02:09:04,kmuz8d,So I guess we don't care about defense again.
10071,2020-12-31 02:09:41,kmuz8d,Bring on JJohnson
10072,2020-12-31 02:09:56,kmuz8d,everytime it seems like the other team shoots 56 percent vs us
10073,2020-12-31 02:10:00,kmuz8d,Ugly quarter.
10074,2020-12-31 02:11:09,kmuz8d,The defense wasn’t even bad but then we give up an offensive rebound or turn it over right after a stop....
10075,2020-12-31 02:17:37,kmuz8d,Allowing 27 bench points through 1.25 quarters is straight embarrassing
10076,2020-12-31 02:21:15,kmuz8d,The Mavericks and scrubs going off for career highs. Name a more iconic duo
10077,2020-12-31 02:23:27,kmuz8d,James Johnson looks really good
10078,2020-12-31 02:28:13,kmuz8d,wedgie from a dunk attempt? Powell really built different
10079,2020-12-31 02:30:24,kmuz8d,Our defense getting carved to pieces :)
10080,2020-12-31 02:30:25,kmuz8d,Every time I get to watch a full match live the other team can't fucking miss. It's baffling.
10081,2020-12-31 02:31:08,kmuz8d,"Lol, wtf? Powell getting outrebounded by lamelo ball?"
10082,2020-12-31 02:31:12,kmuz8d,Mavs don't look interested in this game
10083,2020-12-31 02:31:48,kmuz8d,I think Mavs will blow them out in the second half. They’re hitting unbelievable shots right now with poor form and bad angles on most of them
10084,2020-12-31 02:32:01,kmuz8d,"Lost to the Suns despite Paul and Booker struggling, lost to the Lakers with Lebron playing okay, and now down 9 to Charlotte as their 3 best players are struggling..."
10085,2020-12-31 02:33:51,kmuz8d,LOL Powell
10086,2020-12-31 02:36:54,kmuz8d,Powell has zero rebounds and is -16
10087,2020-12-31 02:37:13,kmuz8d,Lamelo Ball in two quarters already had his best game this season. I don’t want Dwight Powell on espn highlights tomorrow it’s gonna b embarrassing
10088,2020-12-31 02:40:02,kmuz8d,Literally everything is going wrong for us this game
10089,2020-12-31 02:45:05,kmuz8d,"Well, that was a sad 1st half."
10090,2020-12-31 02:48:04,kmuz8d,Worst half they played all season.
10091,2020-12-31 03:06:37,kmuz8d,RED ALERT: DWIGHT POWELL REBOUND
10092,2020-12-31 03:06:52,kmuz8d,This is pathetic
10093,2020-12-31 03:08:12,kmuz8d,Fuck Powell. Motherfucker watches rebounds
10094,2020-12-31 03:09:09,kmuz8d,"Why is Harp talking about 'consistency' with new personal? We have like 2 new non rookies, one starter not on the team last year. There was not that much roster turnover to start this slow."
10095,2020-12-31 03:09:40,kmuz8d,This is pathetic
10096,2020-12-31 03:09:48,kmuz8d,Now I know how the Clips fans felt with this drought we're in
10097,2020-12-31 03:10:41,kmuz8d,We're just getting all of our bad games out in 2020 right guys?....guys?
10098,2020-12-31 03:12:03,kmuz8d,The only bright side I see from this game is that hopefully it becomes clear to Rick that Powell is nowhere near a starting caliber center. That's the only last hope.
10099,2020-12-31 03:12:25,kmuz8d,"Luka too fucking passive this game, needs to get back to the mentality he had last season where he was carryng us, I dont care if that screws up his efficiency"
10100,2020-12-31 03:14:02,kmuz8d,team not good.
10101,2020-12-31 03:15:16,kmuz8d,"Beat the Clips by 50, lose to the Hornets by 30+. What the fuck?"
10102,2020-12-31 03:18:45,kmuz8d,If we can cut this to 10 - 15 by the start of the 4th we have a chance.
10103,2020-12-31 03:21:32,kmuz8d,How ironic...we destroy the clippers by 51 only to get wrecked the next game. What goes around comes around I guess lmao
10104,2020-12-31 03:22:19,kmuz8d,I think Luka is about to make his first apperance on a botum video
10105,2020-12-31 03:22:54,kmuz8d,Is that rim just cursed???
10106,2020-12-31 03:25:26,kmuz8d,This is really no different than watching the Cowboys. I was counting on the Mavs to show us something better.
10107,2020-12-31 03:26:52,kmuz8d,That was the worst qtr of basketball i have ever seen
10108,2020-12-31 03:26:59,kmuz8d,Luka needs to forget about the 3 ball and focus on a mid range jumper.
10109,2020-12-31 03:27:51,kmuz8d,"Our best player having the most embarrassing performance of his career, completely out of shape, and tomorrow people will be like ""let's not overreact"" lol"
10110,2020-12-31 03:28:26,kmuz8d,[deleted]
10111,2020-12-31 03:31:50,kmuz8d,That one Powell block has him now as a 40mpg player the next 20 games in ricks eyes
10112,2020-12-31 03:52:43,kmuz8d,no need to apologize.. Harp should go to the locker room after the game and drop few another of those words tbh
10113,2020-12-31 03:55:56,kmuz8d,That was an Eskimo kiss not a head butt come on
10114,2020-12-31 03:07:06,kmuz8d,"this team aint clicking and the guys screaming dont panick need to shut the fuck up, getting blown out by the hornets is not a good look"
10115,2020-12-31 03:32:54,kmuz8d,"Not to be the overly positive guy, but the start of this season  has been so weird; I think mentally every team in the league is still in preseason mode. I don’t think we’ll be able to accurately assess the value of these teams for a couple months. I mean, the Hornets sans Hayward haven’t played since March, while the Mavs have had an extremely short layoff"
10116,2020-12-31 02:48:56,kmuz8d,This thread needs to calm down lol
10117,2020-12-31 02:57:13,kmuz8d,"Miles Bridges 7 boards, Melo Ball 6 boards

Dwight Powell 0 boards"
10118,2020-12-31 03:47:15,kmuz8d,I don’t understand not putting Luka in to get reps. He clearly needs the work.
10119,2020-12-31 03:56:37,kmuz8d,Lmao JJ sleeping both these pussies would make this night so much better
10120,2020-12-31 01:35:20,kmuz8d,Does anyone have a working stream?
10121,2020-12-31 01:45:39,kmuz8d,"god damn dorian, two years ago, if he put the ball on the floor it was a turnover"
10122,2020-12-31 01:47:02,kmuz8d,I gotta cop Hayward’s hair product
10123,2020-12-31 01:53:57,kmuz8d,The fuck are these turnovers
10124,2020-12-31 01:56:25,kmuz8d,"Those fucking streets... freaking streets 

Lol"
10125,2020-12-31 01:56:28,kmuz8d,Guys are bricking open looks
10126,2020-12-31 01:57:40,kmuz8d,FREE WILLY
10127,2020-12-31 02:01:14,kmuz8d,Looks like rebounding will be a problem today
10128,2020-12-31 02:03:53,kmuz8d,"Hmmmm, that’s a couple of questionable fouls calls against the Mavs already..."
10129,2020-12-31 02:05:50,kmuz8d,Brilliant reffing as usual.
10130,2020-12-31 02:06:45,kmuz8d,What? Come on refs.
10131,2020-12-31 02:07:52,kmuz8d,If that had been Trae Young the Hornets would have copped a Flagrant 2 and a murder charge.
10132,2020-12-31 02:08:22,kmuz8d,Why are the hornets draining every single shot man
10133,2020-12-31 02:09:31,kmuz8d,Terrible quarter we need to improve drastically
10134,2020-12-31 02:10:30,kmuz8d,lol these fuckers still can't rebound
10135,2020-12-31 02:15:22,kmuz8d,James Johnson is our second best passer
10136,2020-12-31 02:15:29,kmuz8d,We lucky Gordon is cold as green bay
10137,2020-12-31 02:15:31,kmuz8d,"Mavs giving Hornets too many extra possessions through OREB/turnovers, also leaving points at the FT line

sloppy"
10138,2020-12-31 02:20:46,kmuz8d,We always blow the hornets the fuck out in Charlotte but struggle against them at home lol
10139,2020-12-31 02:22:44,kmuz8d,Great D by Maxi and Better Clean-Up by Johnson on the fastbreak
10140,2020-12-31 02:23:43,kmuz8d,James Johnson is a really good fit for our bench.
10141,2020-12-31 02:24:22,kmuz8d,I don't know if Maxi or Dwight got memo that they're not Jokic. If you don't have the shot give it safely back to the handler ffs
10142,2020-12-31 02:30:19,kmuz8d,"Has there been a shot, layup, even a dunk that didnt soehow bounce in for hornets tonight when it bounced more than once? So many trash shots going in"
10143,2020-12-31 02:38:27,kmuz8d,The effort on the boards is pathetic
10144,2020-12-31 02:38:46,kmuz8d,Same shit different day.
10145,2020-12-31 02:39:57,kmuz8d,Isaiah Roby had 7 rebounds against the Magic lol. DP got none tonight
10146,2020-12-31 02:40:40,kmuz8d,We have the best broadcast crew. They’ve been so funny lately
10147,2020-12-31 02:43:55,kmuz8d,Cant watch this no more😂
10148,2020-12-31 02:46:10,kmuz8d,this team aint it
10149,2020-12-31 02:48:31,kmuz8d,"I don't know what is up with AAC, but we are just a horrible home team. I've seen these kind of games way too many times last season. I don't know what it is but we tend to show absolutely, positively 0 energy in many of home games."
10150,2020-12-31 02:52:09,kmuz8d,42 bench points for the hornets jeez
10151,2020-12-31 02:55:06,kmuz8d,Big difference is Charlotte has biyombo protecting the rim and we got no one
10152,2020-12-31 03:05:41,kmuz8d,I legit think the AAC is cursed.
10153,2020-12-31 03:07:41,kmuz8d,Why is Dwight still in
10154,2020-12-31 03:08:59,kmuz8d,"Something about this short offseason is causing a lot of games with huge margins. I wonder why, it’s happening to both playoff bound teams and non playoff teams."
10155,2020-12-31 03:09:15,kmuz8d,Watched both first games...missed the Clippers game...watched this one.  FML
10156,2020-12-31 03:09:33,kmuz8d,Why has Luka only taken 5 shots?
10157,2020-12-31 03:09:45,kmuz8d,"oh great, WCS free throws"
10158,2020-12-31 03:10:35,kmuz8d,Can we get some guys that can play basketball? Wtf is this?
10159,2020-12-31 03:12:52,kmuz8d,Luka should drive to the hoop every play. He just does not have a jump shot right now
10160,2020-12-31 03:12:57,kmuz8d,"So apparently the mavs have 2 speeds, crawl and speed."
10161,2020-12-31 03:13:53,kmuz8d,Lottt of blowouts in the NBA this year. Not great for the product
10162,2020-12-31 03:14:43,kmuz8d,"Dwight Powell got a rebound

🚨🚨🚨🥇🥇🥇🚨🚨🚨🥇🥇🥇"
10163,2020-12-31 03:15:09,kmuz8d,Pass to someone for a wide open 3 and watch him miss. No real attempt to even close the gap.
10164,2020-12-31 03:15:18,kmuz8d,Hornets deserve to win with the way they've played. This is embarrassing. No effort and just settling for shitty looks from 3.
10165,2020-12-31 03:16:46,kmuz8d,"Why are we not putting boban in?
Why are we launching a three instead of driving?
What the duck is going on?"

10167,2020-12-31 03:17:25,kmuz8d,My goodness what the hell is happening is everybody but maxi and tim drunk??
10168,2020-12-31 03:17:29,kmuz8d,Ugly ugly basketball
10169,2020-12-31 03:18:08,kmuz8d,How many fkin layups is Richardson gonna miss today
10170,2020-12-31 03:18:52,kmuz8d,Just walk into the paint and you'll be able to score on us.
10171,2020-12-31 03:20:34,kmuz8d,Luka slander is gonna be unreal tonight
10172,2020-12-31 03:20:44,kmuz8d,Luka has become Ben Simmons
10173,2020-12-31 03:22:21,kmuz8d,Live by the blowout die by the blowout
10174,2020-12-31 03:22:37,kmuz8d,"Stop.

Shooting.

3s."
10175,2020-12-31 03:22:51,kmuz8d,What happened to Luka's shooting? He's 2/21 from 3
10176,2020-12-31 03:24:32,kmuz8d,Hahahahhaha what is our shooting?
10177,2020-12-31 03:25:04,kmuz8d,Are they hung over??
10178,2020-12-31 03:25:15,kmuz8d,"This is 3 out of 4 games where they just do not hustle.

I thought maybe the LA game fixed woes but these guys do not move on switches.

Exceptionally unlucky on so many shots but 20 extra points wouldn't matter when you're giving up easy buckets to Biyombo."
10179,2020-12-31 03:26:24,kmuz8d,"Ugly game, we have trouble on defense with team who play fast( first phoenix, now the hornets).
Richardson was questionable before the game, and it showed tonight, he missed every damn lay-up.
Luka started strong but faded quickly and he does not even contest 3's on defense.
It is what is, without KP this team is all about Luka and he did not come prepared for the season and it hurts the team especially on defense..."
10180,2020-12-31 03:31:27,kmuz8d,"I understand that the quality of basketball allover the league right now is so bad , but damn they had 2 days off and they still lack energy this game how is that even possible? What a waste of time after not watching basketball for 2 days and then watching this trash performance."
10181,2020-12-31 03:33:19,kmuz8d,Josh Green can really defend
10182,2020-12-31 03:33:38,kmuz8d,"on the bright side, i was able to trade LBJ for Harden in fantasy... i’d say that’s a pretty big win"
10183,2020-12-31 03:33:54,kmuz8d,I want to see Luka play with the third team.
10184,2020-12-31 03:45:45,kmuz8d,Starters can’t shoot 4/22 from 3 and expect to win.
10185,2020-12-31 03:51:24,kmuz8d,Jrich went 1 for 10 wtf
10186,2020-12-31 04:00:39,kmuz8d,11/41 from 3. Damn.
10187,2020-12-31 03:24:54,kmuz8d,"You have to stay in shape during the off season. I don't understand how you can allow yourself to get so badly out of shape, you're supposed to be the fucking franchise player. Set a damn example. Dirk never was this fucking undisciplined."
10188,2020-12-31 01:58:08,kmuz8d,Dwight Powell is frustrating to watch
10189,2020-12-31 02:29:53,kmuz8d,Powell got out rebounded by a guard LOL
10190,2020-12-31 02:31:37,kmuz8d,"Lamelo literally jumped from behind Powell and got the rebound from him, what is this man doing"
10191,2020-12-31 02:33:53,kmuz8d,"Please take Powell out, he doesn't deserve to get humiliated like this... he offers absolutely nothing today."
10192,2020-12-31 03:43:12,kmuz8d,I am deleting Facebook hitting the gym and consulting an attorney after this game thread
10193,2020-12-31 04:01:28,kmuz8d,Go hit the gym Luka
10194,2020-12-31 02:41:36,kmuz8d,Im not gonna lie Luka been disappointing so far.We expected him to be an MVP but he isnt even at his form from last year. His 3pt shots % gets lower and lower every season. The only thing i like is his FT%.Maybe his on-ball defense too.
10195,2020-12-31 02:43:22,kmuz8d,So we passed up 17 open 3’s to brick a 2 and then brick a 3 right after?
10196,2020-12-31 02:46:12,kmuz8d,lol idc if Luka was unhappy abt going out. Rick brings u out u go out. Coach always is the one in control not the player. We’re not gonna become this team
10197,2020-12-30 16:40:49,kmuz8d,Should we start Green today if Jrich aint playing?
10198,2020-12-31 01:55:14,kmuz8d,How tf is powell a NBA starting center ?
10199,2020-12-31 02:29:08,kmuz8d,"Only Dwight Powell could get a ""foul wedgie."""
10200,2020-12-31 02:32:10,kmuz8d,Dwight literally does nothing that you'd want a big to do. Why why why why why the fuck is he on the floor.
10201,2020-12-31 02:59:44,kmuz8d,Get rid of Powell and get a true rebounder. Or at least play like you want to win.
10202,2020-12-31 03:08:38,kmuz8d,"This game is over but Luka should stay in to the very end regardless, it's obvious he's not going to get in the shape of a professional athlete if left to his own devices."
10203,2020-12-31 03:19:57,kmuz8d,This might be Lukas worst game ever
10204,2020-12-31 03:24:05,kmuz8d,We clearly did something to anger God
10205,2020-12-31 03:24:41,kmuz8d,"Live by the 3, die by the 3. We are turning into the fucking Rockets"
10206,2020-12-31 03:28:05,kmuz8d,"I fap mavs lose, I don't fap mavs win by 50, I fap again mavs lose again. No nut for mavericks is a go."
10207,2020-12-31 03:37:44,kmuz8d,Definitively one more reason to hate 2020.
10208,2020-12-31 03:27:06,kmuz8d,There's no chance Luka wins MVP unless there's a dramatic turnaround. He was ready to start last season and in the bubble. He was just not ready for the season this year.
10209,2020-12-31 01:39:32,kmuz8d,BROS! I can’t contain my excitement I’m cheesin’ so hard hearing these linup callouts. FUUUUCK YEAH
10210,2020-12-31 01:40:23,kmuz8d,I don’t get why in America when there’s a time given for when a game begins it doesn’t actually start until like 15 mins after. I’m being pedantic but like I don’t get it. Happens in the NFL as well
10211,2020-12-31 01:42:12,kmuz8d,"Damn, that court's sexy."
10212,2020-12-31 01:46:43,kmuz8d,Luka should dominate. They have absolutely no one to guard him
10213,2020-12-31 01:49:04,kmuz8d,"You know a player is trash, when they bite on a Powell pump fake"
10214,2020-12-31 01:49:08,kmuz8d,Powell has been practicing that moment for years
10215,2020-12-31 01:52:32,kmuz8d,The offensive foul actually helped them. DFS was sprinting
10216,2020-12-31 01:52:43,kmuz8d,3 wasted assists
10217,2020-12-31 01:52:56,kmuz8d,"We are the worst transition offense team in the league, just embarrassing how many opertinities we squander."
10218,2020-12-31 01:53:26,kmuz8d,I see we got the Dallas Cowboys refs presiding over this game. What the hell.
10219,2020-12-31 01:56:14,kmuz8d,Trey to Jrich!!!! What a beaut!
10220,2020-12-31 01:58:03,kmuz8d,"I really hope Burke works out, it would suck if it turns out to be one of those situations where he has a good run at the end of the season but then reverts back to his numbers before we picked him up."
10221,2020-12-31 01:59:57,kmuz8d,"It's pretty crazy that Luka at 17 and 18 was able to flush down alley oops like we just saw Richardson do but now at the ripe old age of 21 is ""past it"" lol."
10222,2020-12-31 02:00:33,kmuz8d,Call Maxi!!
10223,2020-12-31 02:02:02,kmuz8d,Luka needs to stop with the complaining.. literally could've gotten that missed rebound if he wasn't staring at the ref for a loose ball foul.
10224,2020-12-31 02:02:25,kmuz8d,Lol Maxi has probably already made more 3s this season than in the bubble
10225,2020-12-31 02:03:49,kmuz8d,Dunk on them Willie.
10226,2020-12-31 02:04:22,kmuz8d,they are hitting some bullshit shots
10227,2020-12-31 02:05:05,kmuz8d,I am loving WCS
10228,2020-12-31 02:05:50,kmuz8d,"And ofc this isnt the foul ahahahah fuck thise refs, just unreal"
10229,2020-12-31 02:06:07,kmuz8d,What the fuck did he get a tech for? Getting excited?
10230,2020-12-31 02:06:21,kmuz8d,"Are we sure Powell can actually play this game? Didn't play D on a 3 point shooter, didn't attempt to get a long rebound and instead backed up to help out on the fastbreak, then proceeded to not help out on the fastbreak and left Hardaway to 2 on 1. What the hell is he doing?"
10231,2020-12-31 02:07:22,kmuz8d,Fucking refs. Trae would get 2 fts in same situation!
10232,2020-12-31 02:07:38,kmuz8d,[deleted]
10233,2020-12-31 02:07:46,kmuz8d,Heat check
10234,2020-12-31 02:08:03,kmuz8d,Where is the defense
10235,2020-12-31 02:08:43,kmuz8d,"maxi: 4 3s this quarter

luka: 2 3s all year"
10236,2020-12-31 02:09:26,kmuz8d,Rebounding... it’s fucking hard I guess
10237,2020-12-31 02:09:29,kmuz8d,I'll be the happiest man alive when Powell gets an Offensive board
10238,2020-12-31 02:09:33,kmuz8d,Fuckin hell with that quarter.
10239,2020-12-31 02:09:59,kmuz8d,"Damn Ball, not bad"
10240,2020-12-31 02:11:03,kmuz8d,we really gonna make lamelo look like an all star tonight
10241,2020-12-31 02:11:06,kmuz8d,"We should not get outrebounded by the small hornets, I pray the clipper game was not an anomaly in terms of effort to get rebounds."
10242,2020-12-31 02:11:26,kmuz8d,That release by Ball lol. At least it's quick though
10243,2020-12-31 02:13:52,kmuz8d,"Man, so much energy and ball movement. James Johnson was such a good pickup. Really keeps the offense moving."
10244,2020-12-31 02:14:12,kmuz8d,I think Rick is trying to increase Powell value to trade him cause there is no way he still thinks he deserve this types of minutes.
10245,2020-12-31 02:15:42,kmuz8d,James Johnson is such a good playmaker
10246,2020-12-31 02:16:24,kmuz8d,man they are scoring everything
10247,2020-12-31 02:16:26,kmuz8d,Turnovers will be the end of me
10248,2020-12-31 02:17:28,kmuz8d,This defense still isn’t good imo
10249,2020-12-31 02:18:53,kmuz8d,brunson never passes
10250,2020-12-31 02:20:31,kmuz8d,Nice sequence there for the Brunson basket
10251,2020-12-31 02:21:32,kmuz8d,Charlotte is looking more and more confident with each play
10252,2020-12-31 02:21:45,kmuz8d,Damn these turnovers
10253,2020-12-31 02:22:13,kmuz8d,Loved that whole sequence. Maxi > JRich > JJohnson
10254,2020-12-31 02:23:33,kmuz8d,Maxi has a ridiculous hairline wtf
10255,2020-12-31 02:24:30,kmuz8d,Fuck james Johnson is playing really well tonight.
10256,2020-12-31 02:26:22,kmuz8d,I really like the Johnson + Brunson playmaking chemistry off the bench. More please.
10257,2020-12-31 02:30:08,kmuz8d,We cannot get it going jeez
10258,2020-12-31 02:31:03,kmuz8d,When they do miss we gotta get the rebound
10259,2020-12-31 02:32:22,kmuz8d,"The sense of urgency and effort were apparently left in LA after Sunday. To suck on defense is one thing, to not pick up a simple rebound when you are lucky enough to see a miss is another one."
10260,2020-12-31 02:32:53,kmuz8d,we might actually be bad lol
10261,2020-12-31 02:33:11,kmuz8d,"Again game with no fucking accountability. Powell and burke should be benched for whole game but rick dosnt havd the balls to send the message and he loves his powell too much for it anyway.
This team has got so many bad habbits steaming from lack of accounability from coaching staff."
10262,2020-12-31 02:34:21,kmuz8d,Powell is -16. Enough said
10263,2020-12-31 02:35:10,kmuz8d,please please get powell of the floor I beg you
10264,2020-12-31 02:36:15,kmuz8d,This is so fucking disgraceful.
10265,2020-12-31 02:36:23,kmuz8d,Its laughable the 3pt shot he takes😂😂😂
10266,2020-12-31 02:36:53,kmuz8d,Luka can’t hit 3s and he can’t drive all the time.
10267,2020-12-31 02:38:31,kmuz8d,This is sad
10268,2020-12-31 02:38:32,kmuz8d,why the fuck didn't DFS just shoot that corner shot
10269,2020-12-31 02:39:02,kmuz8d,[deleted]
10270,2020-12-31 02:39:22,kmuz8d,"DFS with the hellsweep, didn’t know Dodo was a Mishima"
10271,2020-12-31 02:39:40,kmuz8d,So much for having a good defense. We cant defend at all
10272,2020-12-31 02:39:46,kmuz8d,"I expected a tough game, but this is just plain terrible. I don't know if they look worse on offense or on defense"
10273,2020-12-31 02:40:19,kmuz8d,if luka finds you in the corner for the open 3 TAKE IT.
10274,2020-12-31 02:41:11,kmuz8d,down 15 against these scrubs lmao
10275,2020-12-31 02:42:41,kmuz8d,Thats not a foul ugh
10276,2020-12-31 02:46:09,kmuz8d,Call Hinton up please
10277,2020-12-31 02:52:24,kmuz8d,We are a 3rd quarter team
10278,2020-12-31 02:53:05,kmuz8d,What did Luka say/do to Rick? I missed it..
10279,2020-12-31 03:01:36,kmuz8d,Why does rozier have that haircut with sideburns and no beard?
10280,2020-12-31 03:03:31,kmuz8d,Hornets tallest guy is 6 inches shorter than Boban.
10281,2020-12-31 03:06:08,kmuz8d,Effort is a big problem this year. Dont know if its just the short offseason or what
10282,2020-12-31 03:06:14,kmuz8d,This is gross. Im ready for some Green minutes. These guys just don't have it tonight.
10283,2020-12-31 03:06:24,kmuz8d,Mavericks? More like Mavbricks today
10284,2020-12-31 03:06:59,kmuz8d,Looking like an Acme Brick commercial out here fam
10285,2020-12-31 03:09:24,kmuz8d,51 points win and then this?
10286,2020-12-31 03:10:29,kmuz8d,Man I wish this team had more regular wins. No comebacks just a regular win where we’re up most of the time.
10287,2020-12-31 03:10:46,kmuz8d,Hornets are shooting right under 50% from 3 while we're right under 30%
10288,2020-12-31 03:12:03,kmuz8d,Yeah that 16-0 run to start the 3rd pretty much sealed any hopes of coming back this game. We look awful. Hornets came to play while we're playing lazy
10289,2020-12-31 03:12:55,kmuz8d,Man I’ve been hyped for this season but this is no bueno
10290,2020-12-31 03:14:09,kmuz8d,">its another ‘our 2nd unit gets annilated by their 2nd unit while our bigs get eaten alive all game’ episode 

I hate this show"
10291,2020-12-31 03:14:18,kmuz8d,harp is actually right.. let’s see if a leader steps up or we just hang our heads
10292,2020-12-31 03:14:20,kmuz8d,Why did Rick pull WCS he was the only bright spot lmao
10293,2020-12-31 03:15:05,kmuz8d,so been at 3 steals since the first quarter.......is this team even trying to win?
10294,2020-12-31 03:16:09,kmuz8d,Welp can’t blame JJax anymore
10295,2020-12-31 03:16:32,kmuz8d,Lol Jrich just got 1 bad game and these so called fans are already ripping him apart
10296,2020-12-31 03:16:42,kmuz8d,The team is defeated. They don’t care anymore
10297,2020-12-31 03:16:54,kmuz8d,This is actually painful.
10298,2020-12-31 03:17:49,kmuz8d,"This is so fucking embarrassing. Right this way to the basket, Mr. Hornet."
10299,2020-12-31 03:18:46,kmuz8d,Wtf is going on with JRich?
10300,2020-12-31 03:19:12,kmuz8d,THJ is playing decent at least
10301,2020-12-31 03:20:29,kmuz8d,Time for Terry and Green. At least give the rookies extended garbage time.
10302,2020-12-31 03:21:09,kmuz8d,Luka playing like Darko Milicic.
10303,2020-12-31 03:21:14,kmuz8d,"And yall seth would not have changed this game, he would get ice cold at random. Our defense would go from trash to extra trash. Plus they’re hitting literally everything."
10304,2020-12-31 03:22:25,kmuz8d,left to do some errands and now we're down by 30. oof.
10305,2020-12-31 03:24:08,kmuz8d,We just need to pretend it's a 90s game and not shoot 3s for the rest of the night.
10306,2020-12-31 03:27:03,kmuz8d,"3rd quarter

30-12 Hornets

Lmao"
10307,2020-12-31 03:32:28,kmuz8d,Feels like I’ve just seen a coin turn up tails 20 times in a row
10308,2020-12-31 03:39:35,kmuz8d,Late but at least some hustle
10309,2020-12-31 03:47:27,kmuz8d,"Repugnant effort is what this boils down to, 100%."
10310,2020-12-31 03:52:21,kmuz8d,Iwundu 👀
10311,2020-12-31 03:53:22,kmuz8d,Thank God we have Boban
10312,2020-12-31 03:54:12,kmuz8d,Jj spinning wheel kick needed
10313,2020-12-31 04:00:46,kmuz8d,We shot our free throws barely better than they shot their 3 pointers
10314,2020-12-31 03:26:24,kmuz8d,This game is a FRAUD! We won the game! There are 10s of points that should have been counted for Dallas that were switched to Charlotte because of the horrible scoreboard software - which has links to Venezuela and CHINA!
10315,2020-12-31 03:22:23,kmuz8d,"Luka regressed so hard what the fuck happened to him, definitely not the same beast as last season."
10316,2020-12-31 03:29:38,kmuz8d,Powell about to play even if we down 50
10317,2020-12-31 03:54:23,kmuz8d,"There may be problems with this squad, but with James Johnson and WCS soft will not be one of them."
10318,2020-12-31 03:36:11,kmuz8d,"*WCS tallies  4 fouls in 7 minutes*

Casuals in this sub: RICK YOU IDIOT, WHY'D YOU TAKE WCS OUT!!!?!?!"
10319,2020-12-31 02:49:46,kmuz8d,This sub will go in the great REEEEEcession when we start losing games with Porzingis.
10320,2020-12-31 03:20:28,kmuz8d,Trae >>>>>> Luka this season
10321,2020-12-31 01:48:37,kmuz8d,Dwight “Pump Fake” Powell
10322,2020-12-31 01:52:56,kmuz8d,God I can’t stand this annoying dude who chimes in with obvious shit or stuff that the other guys already said or corny jokes.
10323,2020-12-31 01:56:42,kmuz8d,Luka needs to go back to step backs
10324,2020-12-31 02:09:04,kmuz8d,Wow what a shit defense 1st quarter
10325,2020-12-31 02:22:09,kmuz8d,Allowing a dude who has averages 1 ppg to destroy us is the most Mavs thing ever
10326,2020-12-31 03:06:13,kmuz8d,Powell is literally just getting the Hornets fast break started by tipping it out to them LMAO
10327,2020-12-31 03:08:07,kmuz8d,Put powell in the d league
10328,2020-12-31 03:09:18,kmuz8d,That half time talk by Rick must have been fire.
10329,2020-12-31 03:20:15,kmuz8d,I think Luka's 3 might be busted right now.
10330,2020-12-31 03:22:49,kmuz8d,"Honestly hope we get smacked by 60, cause we need some humbling. Energy from the start was horrible."
10331,2020-12-31 03:25:23,kmuz8d,This is the shit that happens when your best player comes back overweight. What a fucking disappointment
10332,2020-12-31 03:28:58,kmuz8d,stop blaming this game on powell everyone has been ass minus thj
10333,2020-12-31 02:39:55,kmuz8d,"Luka does not seem to be getting the separation he did last year. I’m not sure how much conditioning related that is, but it’s concerning as far as how his game will age"
10334,2020-12-31 03:12:29,kmuz8d,"Y’all have a good night. I am a diehard MFFL and will always support this team and every one of their players, but I have other things to do than watch the Mavs grt outscored 17-1 to start the half.
Total lack of effort and just jacking 3’s now."
10335,2020-12-31 02:50:57,kmuz8d,"Look, I love Luka as much as anyone here, but tough love: he really needs to get his head out of his ass. Stop whining and complaining, stop butting heads with Rick, quit standing off to the side and doing nothing when someone else has the ball, and start playing. I'm sick of the fighting with the refs too.

You're THE leader of this team and it goes how you go. Freaking act like it."
10336,2020-12-30 19:09:56,kmuz8d,I would like to see WCS with starter minutes. Powell is not good enough and Willie not only played well this season but he was also amazing against the Hornets in our previous game
10337,2020-12-30 19:33:47,kmuz8d,JRich still listed as questionable in 1:30 p et injury report.
10338,2020-12-30 22:45:16,kmuz8d,JRich upgraded to probable in 5:30 p et injury report
10339,2020-12-30 23:41:03,kmuz8d,༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ LUKA TAKE MY ENERGY ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
10340,2020-12-31 01:25:55,kmuz8d,We need to win this solely because I really don't think I can take the round of overreactions if we lose to Hornets.
10341,2020-12-31 01:34:01,kmuz8d,anyone got a FSSW link?
10342,2020-12-31 01:35:43,kmuz8d,Why does the league pass stream have strongman going on LMAOOOO
10343,2020-12-31 01:38:45,kmuz8d,"YES! Oh my God I was gonna be soooooo frustrated if J Rich didn’t start. He’s starting, thank God."
10344,2020-12-31 01:40:14,kmuz8d,Its got to be awkward screaming at an empty arena lol
10345,2020-12-31 01:40:32,kmuz8d,imagine if Luka ever gets beefed up like Hayward
10346,2020-12-31 01:43:40,kmuz8d,Truck dwight powell lmao
10347,2020-12-31 01:43:58,kmuz8d,Powell already in top form
10348,2020-12-31 01:49:10,kmuz8d,god DAMN our court is sexy
10349,2020-12-31 01:49:13,kmuz8d,LMAO Powell's pump fake on point
10350,2020-12-31 01:52:27,kmuz8d,Too open. THJ needs a guy 6 inches in front of him.
10351,2020-12-31 01:54:40,kmuz8d,Rick maybe try some Jrich plays if u decided that he plays tonight?
10352,2020-12-31 01:54:57,kmuz8d,HOLY SHIT WHERE ARE THE TISSUES
10353,2020-12-31 01:54:59,kmuz8d,RICHARDSON
10354,2020-12-31 01:56:29,kmuz8d,Geez what a beautiful teardrop by Hayward. Man can still play.
10355,2020-12-31 01:57:52,kmuz8d,Hayward is a bucket
10356,2020-12-31 01:59:41,kmuz8d,Luka looks worse from 3 then last year.We might see him at 28%.Instead of the % going up is going down.
10357,2020-12-31 02:00:54,kmuz8d,Kleber's shot is real.
10358,2020-12-31 02:00:56,kmuz8d,why is luka complaining about the rebound
10359,2020-12-31 02:01:16,kmuz8d,Kleber. Feed that man 3rd quarter Klay style.
10360,2020-12-31 02:01:35,kmuz8d,LMAO MAXI!
10361,2020-12-31 02:01:56,kmuz8d,Why are game threads sorted by best... can we fix that in future games?
10362,2020-12-31 02:02:26,kmuz8d,TRILL
10363,2020-12-31 02:03:11,kmuz8d,WCS continues to impress!
10364,2020-12-31 02:03:16,kmuz8d,Willie baby
10365,2020-12-31 02:03:25,kmuz8d,DUNK THAT SHIT WILLIE!
10366,2020-12-31 02:03:36,kmuz8d,I’m listening to the hornets announcers. I actually really like them. They get excited regardless of which team does something great.
10367,2020-12-31 02:03:40,kmuz8d,fun fact: maxi has more 3s in the last 5 mins of this game than Luka has all year
10368,2020-12-31 02:04:12,kmuz8d,WCS Feasting!
10369,2020-12-31 02:04:26,kmuz8d,I like Willy!
10370,2020-12-31 02:05:03,kmuz8d,jesus this hornets team is fast
10371,2020-12-31 02:05:05,kmuz8d,I really wanna see how Willie looks replacing Powell in the starting lineup.
10372,2020-12-31 02:05:58,kmuz8d,No foul. Sure.
10373,2020-12-31 02:06:12,kmuz8d,2nd foul on WCS right?
10374,2020-12-31 02:06:16,kmuz8d,"That reach in was an obvious foul, should've been called because that came before the offensive foul."
10375,2020-12-31 02:06:17,kmuz8d,77 is heated.
10376,2020-12-31 02:06:20,kmuz8d,"Oh my fucking God really refs? This is every night now, nickle and diming us with ticky tack fucking BULL SHIT. It adds up and we lose games because of it."
10377,2020-12-31 02:06:33,kmuz8d,great effort by THJ chasing down that long rebound
10378,2020-12-31 02:07:45,kmuz8d,My GOD MAXI!
10379,2020-12-31 02:08:03,kmuz8d,But that why we got James Johnson
10380,2020-12-31 02:08:19,kmuz8d,What’s up the Bridges brothers and going crazy against us
10381,2020-12-31 02:08:21,kmuz8d,this game smells really bad
10382,2020-12-31 02:08:49,kmuz8d,Yeah that was not a good quarter.
10383,2020-12-31 02:08:56,kmuz8d,We'd be up 10 if not for the refs. And we've missed a bunch of wide open shots
10384,2020-12-31 02:12:23,kmuz8d,"Alright, how on Earth did Hornets shoot more FTs than us when they had 3 fouls on like first 30 seconds. We should've capitalized on it and abuse FT line"
10385,2020-12-31 02:13:02,kmuz8d,"Need to take care of the fucking ball, we are not rebounding and giving sloppy passes like the game against the lakers."
10386,2020-12-31 02:14:55,kmuz8d,Johnson and THJ have already a nice chemistry
10387,2020-12-31 02:15:04,kmuz8d,"Man I’m loving Johnson

Edit: James, that is...."
10388,2020-12-31 02:15:49,kmuz8d,"With the court, the green uniforms look even more *correct*"
10389,2020-12-31 02:15:50,kmuz8d,Is just impossible to have some fun while watching Powell playing basketball man...
10390,2020-12-31 02:16:13,kmuz8d,Why does James Johnson has so much swag?
10391,2020-12-31 02:16:16,kmuz8d,Run all the second unit offense through James Johnson
10392,2020-12-31 02:16:17,kmuz8d,where is the defense??
10393,2020-12-31 02:17:08,kmuz8d,these type of turnovers kills us
10394,2020-12-31 02:18:58,kmuz8d,paint defense struggling...
10395,2020-12-31 02:19:43,kmuz8d,"lamelo just ate jb with that block, wow"
10396,2020-12-31 02:19:51,kmuz8d,REBOUND THE BALL DAMMIT
10397,2020-12-31 02:20:45,kmuz8d,"James ""CP3"" Johnson"
10398,2020-12-31 02:22:00,kmuz8d,James Johnson yes sir
10399,2020-12-31 02:22:24,kmuz8d,Oooo buddy do our starters look awful today outside of THJ
10400,2020-12-31 02:22:50,kmuz8d,When Tim is on he looks phenomenal. shame he cant maintain such consistency
10401,2020-12-31 02:22:56,kmuz8d,JJ IS THE MAN!
10402,2020-12-31 02:23:03,kmuz8d,dude had 4 points all season shooting like kd vs us
10403,2020-12-31 02:23:06,kmuz8d,James Johnson is the rec pick up game OG that knows how to make every pass and never gets tired.
10404,2020-12-31 02:23:12,kmuz8d,Feels like Luka was put in a timeout 😕
10405,2020-12-31 02:26:24,kmuz8d,cmon JRich Lamelo cant shoot dont overplay
10406,2020-12-31 02:27:58,kmuz8d,"Well, no dunks guys gonna love a Canadian got that wedgie"
10407,2020-12-31 02:29:33,kmuz8d,"dude, this bum is making the craziest shots"
10408,2020-12-31 02:29:54,kmuz8d,“i get excited about weird things” - mark followill ladies and gentlemen
10409,2020-12-31 02:31:20,kmuz8d,bruh Luka could 100% clamp someone and it would still go in
10410,2020-12-31 02:31:38,kmuz8d,"they aint missing anything, we aint shooting good, we aint rebounding good, we had some tournovers.

wouldnt surprise me if we are down 10 at the half tbh"
10411,2020-12-31 02:32:01,kmuz8d,Ffs Powell you are like 6 inches taller than ball get a fucking rebound
10412,2020-12-31 02:32:02,kmuz8d,"I mean this is almost a carbon copy of last year’s game against charlotte so far. They get out to a 7ish point lead, we kinda hang around and inch closer, then the lead swells back up to 7 or 8."
10413,2020-12-31 02:33:30,kmuz8d,Dwight Powell HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
10414,2020-12-31 02:33:46,kmuz8d,He walked underneath JR wtf
10415,2020-12-31 02:35:01,kmuz8d,Our interior defense is absolutely nonexistent. Just awful.
10416,2020-12-31 02:35:34,kmuz8d,i dont think Luka is a bad shooter but he takes way to many hard 3's
10417,2020-12-31 02:37:10,kmuz8d,"This is humiliating, a complete embarrassment"
10418,2020-12-31 02:37:18,kmuz8d,Of course LaMelo goes off against us did anybody expect anything else
10419,2020-12-31 02:37:36,kmuz8d,We getting cooked by Lamelo Ball.
10420,2020-12-31 02:38:40,kmuz8d,Luka can’t score on will. That’s fucked. 9 points
10421,2020-12-31 02:38:42,kmuz8d,Rick to DFS: SWEEP THE LEG!!!!
10422,2020-12-31 02:39:01,kmuz8d,This has been hard to watch
10423,2020-12-31 02:39:04,kmuz8d,This is just like last years Hornets game. We are just getting obliterated.
10424,2020-12-31 02:39:15,kmuz8d,Lmao DFS...just shoot the fucking 3
10425,2020-12-31 02:40:07,kmuz8d,They are getting way too many good looks WTF is going on
10426,2020-12-31 02:40:07,kmuz8d,Missing KP is killing this team. This season could turn fast if KP misses most of January
10427,2020-12-31 02:40:12,kmuz8d,"If Rick does not break some shit in the locker room during half time, he is doing it wrong"
10428,2020-12-31 02:40:46,kmuz8d,"KP is a game changer, his defense and ability to spread the floor for Luka will change this team. Also will help with rebounding. Have FAITH!"
10429,2020-12-31 02:41:26,kmuz8d,Sorely missing the inside defense from KP
10430,2020-12-31 02:41:46,kmuz8d,Thank you Doe Doe we needed that
10431,2020-12-31 02:41:55,kmuz8d,Save us THJ
10432,2020-12-31 02:44:39,kmuz8d,JRich Hobbling
10433,2020-12-31 02:45:01,kmuz8d,Another missed three by DOE
10434,2020-12-31 02:45:34,kmuz8d,my stream a whole minute late smh
10435,2020-12-31 02:47:43,kmuz8d,Just straight up getting outplayed
10436,2020-12-31 03:03:20,kmuz8d,"Ah Rick don't be doing the Jason Garrett ""clapping after the team absolutely sucks"" bull."
10437,2020-12-31 03:04:44,kmuz8d,Give us BOBAN
10438,2020-12-31 03:04:51,kmuz8d,I really don't understand how the fuck any defense can be this fucking bad
10439,2020-12-31 03:05:02,kmuz8d,The fuck shots was that
10440,2020-12-31 03:05:43,kmuz8d,Wow. Everyone missed 😐
10441,2020-12-31 03:05:52,kmuz8d,Whats Lukas 3 point percentage for the season?
10442,2020-12-31 03:06:42,kmuz8d,"This is truly one of those games man. Playing an average to bad team, nothing goes our way and get blown out."
10443,2020-12-31 03:08:29,kmuz8d,Drive. Get to the line. Score points with the clock stopped.
10444,2020-12-31 03:08:34,kmuz8d,"Just tuning in, wtf?"
10445,2020-12-31 03:09:00,kmuz8d,Sheesh the start to this season has been weird.
10446,2020-12-31 03:10:10,kmuz8d,Why hasn’t Hoban played?
10447,2020-12-31 03:10:27,kmuz8d,Can’t shoot. Can’t rebound. Only thing we can do is pass the ball to someone wide open but they Brock it anyway
10448,2020-12-31 03:11:05,kmuz8d,Hornets. What a defensive juggernaut
10449,2020-12-31 03:12:06,kmuz8d,"Aight, ima head out.... not worth watching a team that isn’t trying"
10450,2020-12-31 03:12:20,kmuz8d,I am so pissed man
10451,2020-12-31 03:13:04,kmuz8d,Just bricks everywhere
10452,2020-12-31 03:13:05,kmuz8d,Ass
10453,2020-12-31 03:13:06,kmuz8d,i took a shower and i come out to this ayo
10454,2020-12-31 03:13:28,kmuz8d,Can you please wake me up when they score
10455,2020-12-31 03:13:55,kmuz8d,Luka is just a step slow
10456,2020-12-31 03:14:13,kmuz8d,This season so far is cowboys season level of disappointment.
10457,2020-12-31 03:14:14,kmuz8d,"lmao this is comedy, a truly shameful performance"
10458,2020-12-31 03:14:41,kmuz8d,so what happend? how did Luka completly lose his jumpshot? his mechanics are the same but hes not even hitting 20%? what the hell?
10459,2020-12-31 03:15:09,kmuz8d,feels like pure shit just want tall man back
10460,2020-12-31 03:15:21,kmuz8d,I want to see Green. At this point he can't play worse than JRich or Dorian.
10461,2020-12-31 03:15:31,kmuz8d,This team just looks like they don’t give a fuck on rebounding an defense
10462,2020-12-31 03:15:41,kmuz8d,I honestly don’t think we make the playoffs. People were laughing at Knicks fans for saying we didn’t get better but they might be right. We are horrible
10463,2020-12-31 03:16:17,kmuz8d,THJ and Maxi are the only guys who have a respectable shooting nights
10464,2020-12-31 03:16:44,kmuz8d,"Josh Richardson 1 for 10 tonight, 0 for 4 from 3 point range."
10465,2020-12-31 03:17:41,kmuz8d,wow. 5 pts in the 3rd quarter.
10466,2020-12-31 03:17:55,kmuz8d,Theyre playing coffin dance music LOL! Very appropriate right now
10467,2020-12-31 03:20:45,kmuz8d,This is an 82 point swing from last game.  How is that even possible.
10468,2020-12-31 03:20:51,kmuz8d,That’s it - the Mavs need to sign me to a 10-day contract.
10469,2020-12-31 03:20:54,kmuz8d,"I coulda told you that J Rich wasn't going to sustain the shooting he had over the last few games.....people were already saying we don't need THJ's shooting anymore cuz we got J Rich. 

J Rich will end up being a good shooter but he's not gonna be our Klay Thompson like some people thought based on 3 good games"
10470,2020-12-31 03:22:35,kmuz8d,"I fucking hate WCS, dude has literally everything to be the starting center and make 4 fouls in 5 minutes in the game"
10471,2020-12-31 03:24:14,kmuz8d,Did we just get hit with a backboard burke
10472,2020-12-31 03:29:57,kmuz8d,Can’t make free throws tonight either.
10473,2020-12-31 03:33:23,kmuz8d,If only the Stars season had already started. Right now this is all I’ve got.
10474,2020-12-31 03:37:22,kmuz8d,I haven’t been able to watch much of luka except the second half of the Lakers game when he looked good. What’s his problem?
10475,2020-12-31 03:40:04,kmuz8d,Let’s get Josh Green some looks
10476,2020-12-31 03:40:24,kmuz8d,"Haven’t gotten to watch all night, what’s the problem???"
10477,2020-12-31 03:46:15,kmuz8d,What did Harp say?
10478,2020-12-31 03:46:15,kmuz8d,"Man, why wasn't Powell hustling like this from the beginning?"
10479,2020-12-31 03:52:58,kmuz8d,Somebody does not want to see about JJ.
10480,2020-12-31 03:53:16,kmuz8d,unleash James Johnson
10481,2020-12-31 02:09:45,kmuz8d,We’re the unluckiest team in the fucking league I swear to god
10482,2020-12-31 02:55:08,kmuz8d,"The powell bum is actualy -16 and 0 rebounds in 13min looooool. Thos is just unreal. Just fucking unreal, how one guy who has coaches dirty pics, can ruin whole fucking team"
10483,2020-12-31 03:02:44,kmuz8d,I wonder what Powell has on Rick to be getting starting minutes...
10484,2020-12-31 03:20:55,kmuz8d,Luka has completely lost the ability to shoot jumpers. Its almost embarrassing at this point
10485,2020-12-31 03:54:32,kmuz8d,Johnson with the dirty play c'mon now. We getting our asses whooped and you pull that shit? Weak sauce for a man w/ a black belt.
10486,2020-12-30 05:04:41,kmuz8d,We got this.
10487,2020-12-31 00:26:07,kmuz8d,Anyone have a stream link? I have YouTube TV and sadly can't watch the game. Absolute fuckery.
10488,2020-12-31 00:32:23,kmuz8d,i want the Mavs to break the halftime record from the clippers game :)
10489,2020-12-31 01:27:32,kmuz8d,"Okay, I have a lot more sympathy for Jordan and him taking everything personally. I saw some... calm down. breathe... I saw some — *people* — on r/NBA saying Trey Young was better than or close to as good as Luka. 

Now what’s funny is, when I was meditating a few minutes ago, I realized, “Who cares what they think?” but it still honestly burned me. I’m still salty about it. Breathe. It’s all good."
10490,2020-12-31 01:58:14,kmuz8d,luka is shooting 12% from 3 so far on the year
10491,2020-12-31 02:04:26,kmuz8d,Luka and WCS need to play together a lot more than they do
10492,2020-12-31 02:28:35,kmuz8d,"This bum with this brokenass jumper now not missing anythjng, go figure"
10493,2020-12-31 02:41:41,kmuz8d,why are they playing “shawty fee like a melody in my head”? that dj needa go
10494,2020-12-31 02:45:59,kmuz8d,Mid range really is a lost art in the NBA. We passed up like 5 open mid range for 3s
10495,2020-12-31 03:09:33,kmuz8d,Okay Imma stop watching... See you guys in 2021. This is terrible.
10496,2020-12-31 03:12:07,kmuz8d,"I'm taking a break from this team, better from my mental health. See you guys in a few weeks."
10497,2020-12-31 03:12:16,kmuz8d,"I'm quitting today, travelled for 5 hours, been stressed enough, the thoughts I'm having towards Powell would get me arrested"
10498,2020-12-31 03:12:24,kmuz8d,Powell really needs to be benched
10499,2020-12-31 03:16:10,kmuz8d,“Defense is our speciality now”
10500,2020-12-31 03:20:00,kmuz8d,smh this crazy Luka about to be under 10% from 3
10501,2020-12-31 03:53:47,kmuz8d,That might be a suspension.
10502,2020-12-31 02:54:52,kmuz8d,[deleted]
10503,2020-12-31 03:53:43,kmuz8d,Wow his brother comes off the bench on to the court to talk shit. Fucking clowns
10504,2020-12-31 03:57:58,kmuz8d,If the Laker fans could harass KCP into shooting good we can harass Luka into getting fit
10505,2020-12-31 03:29:52,kmuz8d,"Holy fucking shit the doomers in here shut up godamn. A couple bad games and assholes say trae > luka. Are you kidding me? The bucks got
Blown out by the knicks, we blew-out the clippers. The nuggets lost to the kings. Shit happens, get a fucking grip. Not every team is going to shoot 90% against us"
10506,2020-12-31 02:43:56,kmuz8d,Luka throwing a tempter tantrum at rick. That's not good.
10507,2020-12-31 01:44:10,kmuz8d,[deleted]
10508,2020-12-31 02:06:28,kmuz8d,Luka getting murdered an no calls
10509,2020-12-31 02:09:56,kmuz8d,Wheres my fucking guy Josh Green
10510,2020-12-31 02:09:59,kmuz8d,feel like we lose this one
10511,2020-12-31 02:10:33,kmuz8d,we're getting memed on 😔
10512,2020-12-31 02:10:42,kmuz8d,you can tell we are the better team on the floor but we are down 7 by just being careless with the ball and some bullshit shots they have been hitting
10513,2020-12-31 02:11:24,kmuz8d,they got out hustled. dwight didnt even jump on many rebounds right by him
10514,2020-12-31 02:11:55,kmuz8d,"Everyone blaming the refs, they haven’t made us miss open 3s and play horrible defence"
10515,2020-12-31 02:12:17,kmuz8d,put in WCS pls
10516,2020-12-31 02:19:29,kmuz8d,Man brunson is such a ballhog for such a avrage player honestly
10517,2020-12-31 02:29:49,kmuz8d,My boi Powell king of tips that go straight to the other team
10518,2020-12-31 02:35:37,kmuz8d,"12% on threes, that's pretty embarrassing to be honest."
10519,2020-12-31 02:37:00,kmuz8d,I think I have legit anger issues... I don’t even wanna tell y’all the thoughts running thru my head. Suffice to say I’m pissed.
10520,2020-12-31 03:06:36,kmuz8d,"Man, if Luka has regressed as much as he's showing in the first few games of the season and plays similar to this the whole year, this team is screwed beyond belief!"
10521,2020-12-31 03:07:55,kmuz8d,Dwight is a 0 impact player
10522,2020-12-31 03:08:45,kmuz8d,This team is not good without KP
10523,2020-12-31 03:09:21,kmuz8d,It's been way too long since we beat Charlotte. This was supposed to be the 'easy' game on our schedule.
10524,2020-12-31 03:10:11,kmuz8d,I don’t think Powell should play more than 5 minutes a game when KP gets back. Terrible defender and not the same offensive player after the injury
10525,2020-12-31 03:35:26,kmuz8d,It would be a miracle to get this down to a 12 point deficit.
10526,2020-12-31 03:57:41,kmuz8d,can terry take some of burke mins
10527,2020-12-31 04:01:36,kmuz8d,i wanna see tyler bey
10528,2020-12-31 03:35:08,kmuz8d,"I said it before but KP alone aint saving this team. There are fundamental issues with effort and the flow of the offense we need to adress, either for this season or the next."
10529,2020-12-31 03:41:29,kmuz8d,Hot damn Hayward is a beautiful man
10530,2020-12-31 02:51:58,kmuz8d,"Look lets not act like this Hornets team is trash, don't forget they just beat the Nets with Kyrie and KD. I just was expecting Devante Graham to be the one giving the Mavs trouble not Lamelo lol."
10531,2020-12-31 02:59:19,kmuz8d,Our guys have this second half. Charlotte will cool off and Rick will tighten the ship. I'm optimistic
10532,2020-12-31 03:23:27,kmuz8d,I still believe.... had some good shots/layups they just arent falling
10533,2020-12-31 03:34:39,kmuz8d,"The sad reality is that Luka has not been in NBA shape since coming over from Europe. Even last year at the height of his powers not only was he out of shape compared to the average NBA player, he was out of shape compared to himself when he was a teenager in the Euroleague! If you look at his Euro highlights its ridiculous how different his body looked and how much more bounce and quickness he had.

Now this season he's tripled down on the fatness. It's so disappointing."
10534,2020-12-31 03:31:44,kmuz8d,90% of people in this thread don't deserve Luka.
10535,2020-12-31 01:37:31,kmuz8d,What’s the point of lifting this thing if it has wheels?
10536,2020-12-31 01:38:23,kmuz8d,Can someone help me answer? Are we rostering players that could (should) be In development league?
10537,2020-12-31 01:39:08,kmuz8d,That intro just got me hype!! So good
10538,2020-12-31 01:41:25,kmuz8d,Any solid streams? Spectrum moved fssw out of my package and I have to upgrade if I want it
10539,2020-12-31 01:43:05,kmuz8d,Throwback court is cool tbh

10542,2020-12-31 01:46:55,kmuz8d,loving our defense
10543,2020-12-31 01:47:29,kmuz8d,Charlotte is such a weird team to me
10544,2020-12-31 01:47:32,kmuz8d,Hayward 2 fouls👀
10545,2020-12-31 01:49:10,kmuz8d,The defender FLEW by Powell hahah
10546,2020-12-31 01:49:30,kmuz8d,Charlotte really misswd the scouting report if they are still biting on that powell pumpfake lol.
10547,2020-12-31 01:49:46,kmuz8d,"If you never watched basketball, and saw the hornet player bite that hard on the pump fake, you would believe that Powell is Curry"
10548,2020-12-31 01:50:06,kmuz8d,Really digging this jersey-court combo
10549,2020-12-31 01:50:17,kmuz8d,"We looking good tho, I like the defense outside of that lakers game. Luka looks better every game as well."
10550,2020-12-31 01:50:25,kmuz8d,"Apparently these are the hair products Hayward uses - [https://blumaan.com/collections/products](https://blumaan.com/collections/products)

10551,2020-12-31 01:54:17,kmuz8d,I like Luka's D so far
10552,2020-12-31 01:54:25,kmuz8d,There is no reason this team should be down rn...
10553,2020-12-31 01:55:07,kmuz8d,We are playing nice defense
10554,2020-12-31 01:55:11,kmuz8d,Great offensive transition by the Hornets.
10555,2020-12-31 01:55:11,kmuz8d,JRICH GOTDAMN
10556,2020-12-31 01:59:18,kmuz8d,"I like how we’re playing overall, Hornets are awfully lucky those open threes aren’t falling for us right now. We keep getting open looks like that they’ll start falling"
10557,2020-12-31 02:00:26,kmuz8d,Hornets commentators have to be the worst in the league
10558,2020-12-31 02:00:28,kmuz8d,Maxi so smooth!
10559,2020-12-31 02:00:34,kmuz8d,THREEBER
10560,2020-12-31 02:00:41,kmuz8d,I don't like being a team that lives or dies by the 3. We aren't the Warriors during their 3 titles. There's got to be some playcall changes whenever this team is just throwing up bricks.
10561,2020-12-31 02:01:12,kmuz8d,Kl3ber -> Kl3b3r
10562,2020-12-31 02:01:21,kmuz8d,Maxi “Piano Man” Kleber
10563,2020-12-31 02:01:43,kmuz8d,Smooth hand Maxi
10564,2020-12-31 02:01:54,kmuz8d,MAXXXI
10565,2020-12-31 02:02:51,kmuz8d,"3 point shooting aside, Luka is playing really well.  He's gotten his teammates a ton of good looks"
10566,2020-12-31 02:03:14,kmuz8d,WCS!
10567,2020-12-31 02:03:59,kmuz8d,Charlotte looking like a competent team tonight
10568,2020-12-31 02:04:25,kmuz8d,WCS! Love this guy!
10569,2020-12-31 02:04:51,kmuz8d,They are just not letting us defend. Breath around those guys and hornets get FTs
10570,2020-12-31 02:04:55,kmuz8d,When are they gonna change our sidebar schedule?!?
10571,2020-12-31 02:05:14,kmuz8d,"I trust our depth over charlottes, we gotta start hitting some of these open looks tho"
10572,2020-12-31 02:06:03,kmuz8d,If this game is anything like last year’s home game against Charlotte this is gonna be annoying lol
10573,2020-12-31 02:06:57,kmuz8d,Dude these Charlotte announcers are the most annoying group I have ever heard. It’s like they put max kellerman on the mic talking shit about the opposing team constantly.
10574,2020-12-31 02:07:51,kmuz8d,MY GOD MAXI
10575,2020-12-31 02:07:52,kmuz8d,Keep it going Maxi!
10576,2020-12-31 02:08:23,kmuz8d,HEAT CHECK MAXI
10577,2020-12-31 02:08:32,kmuz8d,Its a battle between Kleber and Bridges lmao.
10578,2020-12-31 02:10:59,kmuz8d,"Getting smashed on D, better sit JJohnson all quarter"
10579,2020-12-31 02:11:08,kmuz8d,When was the last time Cuban got fined for shitting on the refs?
10580,2020-12-31 02:11:13,kmuz8d,"Atrocious first quarter.
Get James Johnson in there."
10581,2020-12-31 02:12:31,kmuz8d,Save us THJ
10582,2020-12-31 02:13:55,kmuz8d,"This would be a terrible early season home loss.
At some point blame has to fall at Rick’s feet."
10583,2020-12-31 02:14:40,kmuz8d,MAKE YOUR FUCKING FREE THROWS
10584,2020-12-31 02:14:50,kmuz8d,thj willing them back into this
10585,2020-12-31 02:15:09,kmuz8d,Brunson is def one of my favorite mavs. Dude is just so fucking tough.
10586,2020-12-31 02:16:32,kmuz8d,Like how lucky are those bums wtf lmfao
10587,2020-12-31 02:17:03,kmuz8d,We do have a lot of hustle on this bench unit.
10588,2020-12-31 02:17:45,kmuz8d,Our big rotation leaves a lot to be desired. Not enough rim protection or rebounding down there
10589,2020-12-31 02:18:21,kmuz8d,We’re playing real fast and loose tonight
10590,2020-12-31 02:18:32,kmuz8d,THAT HUSTLE DOE DOE AND JB
10591,2020-12-31 02:18:46,kmuz8d,Our defense looking pretty suspect
10592,2020-12-31 02:18:55,kmuz8d,Goddamn these turnovers
10593,2020-12-31 02:19:34,kmuz8d,we are getting bullied by Biyombo
10594,2020-12-31 02:19:40,kmuz8d,This is just like the hornets game last season. Everything is going right for them lmao
10595,2020-12-31 02:19:51,kmuz8d,rebounding fundamentals and effort level still not there.
10596,2020-12-31 02:20:02,kmuz8d,Our defense and effort its back to our first 2 games.
10597,2020-12-31 02:22:35,kmuz8d,Our role players had soweit incredible dump turnovers
10598,2020-12-31 02:22:49,kmuz8d,James Johnson!
10599,2020-12-31 02:22:53,kmuz8d,Where’s luka?
10600,2020-12-31 02:23:09,kmuz8d,Good make-up block by kleber
10601,2020-12-31 02:23:37,kmuz8d,Typical the Charlotte bench hasn’t missed a shot yet..
10602,2020-12-31 02:23:59,kmuz8d,Alright defense. You got a pass cause they were hitting stupid shots but now you're just looking stupid. We got to clean this up.
10603,2020-12-31 02:23:59,kmuz8d,ain’t not foul. hornets bench needa chill
10604,2020-12-31 02:25:26,kmuz8d,Loving the hustle from the new JJ. He keeps playing like this he will be my 3rd favorite JJ behind Barea and The Jet Plane
10605,2020-12-31 02:26:54,kmuz8d,FTs are gonna kill us tonight isn't it
10606,2020-12-31 02:27:18,kmuz8d,Fuckin hell
10607,2020-12-31 02:27:19,kmuz8d,Their small ball lineup looks scary wtf
10608,2020-12-31 02:28:30,kmuz8d,Shoulda pump faked
10609,2020-12-31 02:29:02,kmuz8d,"I was looking for the ball, I admit"
10610,2020-12-31 02:29:43,kmuz8d,Damn let’s just keep bricking wide open shots.
10611,2020-12-31 02:29:46,kmuz8d,Second chance points again...
10612,2020-12-31 02:30:00,kmuz8d,PLAY JOSH GREEN
10613,2020-12-31 02:30:18,kmuz8d,Lamelo bringing the ball up looks like he's simultaneously walking and sprinting
10614,2020-12-31 02:31:09,kmuz8d,PJ Washington was shooting an abysmal 38% from the field before this game lmao
10615,2020-12-31 02:31:15,kmuz8d,GET A REBOUND
10616,2020-12-31 02:32:01,kmuz8d,"In 17 minutes, our centers have combined for 0 rebounds.

Lamelo Ball has 5."
10617,2020-12-31 02:32:32,kmuz8d,I certainly missed this informative Rooms to Go Lounge segment.
10618,2020-12-31 02:33:23,kmuz8d,"Ever since Powell came on the court, things have got real bad"
10619,2020-12-31 02:33:27,kmuz8d,Why is our rebounding so terrible??
10620,2020-12-31 02:33:28,kmuz8d,11 Million Man Dwight Powell can grab a rebound
10621,2020-12-31 02:33:43,kmuz8d,powell lol
10622,2020-12-31 02:34:57,kmuz8d,This is not looking good ...
10623,2020-12-31 02:34:59,kmuz8d,I don't believe that Luka worked on his shooting.
10624,2020-12-31 02:35:27,kmuz8d,Another BS no call
10625,2020-12-31 02:35:39,kmuz8d,$100 says Carlisle blinked at the same time Powell missed that 3.
10626,2020-12-31 02:35:45,kmuz8d,This is unwatchable.
10627,2020-12-31 02:35:46,kmuz8d,Put Bobi in pls
10628,2020-12-31 02:35:47,kmuz8d,Bruh just fing bench Powell and never put him in ever again.
10629,2020-12-31 02:35:47,kmuz8d,We’re in our own heads rn cmon Mavs
10630,2020-12-31 02:35:47,kmuz8d,Luka needs to stop shooting threes man
10631,2020-12-31 02:36:04,kmuz8d,This game in particular is so very maddening
10632,2020-12-31 02:36:13,kmuz8d,Only the Mavs could destroy a contender by 50 and then get demolished by a sub .500 team's scrubs the very next game...
10633,2020-12-31 02:36:16,kmuz8d,amazing shot selection
10634,2020-12-31 02:36:32,kmuz8d,The rim is our best defender...
10635,2020-12-31 02:37:17,kmuz8d,We play so bad my god.
10636,2020-12-31 02:37:37,kmuz8d,"This is embarrassing, they are absolutly kicking our asses."
10637,2020-12-31 02:37:49,kmuz8d,Our entire team is getting absolutely punked and everyone blaming one dude
10638,2020-12-31 02:37:53,kmuz8d,What the hell is Dallas doinf
10639,2020-12-31 02:38:04,kmuz8d,it's really hard to watch tbh
10640,2020-12-31 02:38:19,kmuz8d,What happened to Luka.’s 3? It hasn’t been close at all this year
10641,2020-12-31 02:39:15,kmuz8d,It’s plain lack of effort. I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re just gassed or unmotivated.
10642,2020-12-31 02:39:18,kmuz8d,That’s mega bullshit
10643,2020-12-31 02:39:53,kmuz8d,If your are a bad player needing confidence pull up from 28 vs the mavs you will hit it 24/7
10644,2020-12-31 02:40:00,kmuz8d,lmao Doe doe was licking his chops when he was tripping him.
10645,2020-12-31 02:40:16,kmuz8d,"Imagine dropping 50+ on the clippers and letting Hornets score 70 in a half, what a fucking joke"
10646,2020-12-31 02:40:58,kmuz8d,This lineup will bring us back 100%
10647,2020-12-31 02:41:02,kmuz8d,"the ref with the fade is facking annoyin me so far, such a big ego."
10648,2020-12-31 02:41:33,kmuz8d,Popovich was ejected from the game just now due to blatant rigging for the Lakers. The refs are unable to hide their rigging any more. It’s too obvious.
10649,2020-12-31 02:41:56,kmuz8d,Grayson Finney-Smith
10650,2020-12-31 02:42:24,kmuz8d,TIME FOR A RUN
10651,2020-12-31 02:42:43,kmuz8d,Finally some hustle and life
10652,2020-12-31 02:42:53,kmuz8d,"Just saw the score, what the fuck is going on?"
10653,2020-12-31 02:43:14,kmuz8d,Tim....dunk that shit
10654,2020-12-31 02:44:29,kmuz8d,Give Timmy more touches
10655,2020-12-31 02:44:59,kmuz8d,That drive from j rich was tough when u could see Timmy WIDE open
10656,2020-12-31 02:48:41,kmuz8d,"Luka going Shannon.. ""Don't do that Skip"""
10657,2020-12-31 02:55:50,kmuz8d,"We about to get sassy Luka. 

Sassy Luka is hungry."
10658,2020-12-31 03:01:23,kmuz8d,Good lord what a terrible sequence to start the half
10659,2020-12-31 03:01:30,kmuz8d,Great start
10660,2020-12-31 03:01:59,kmuz8d,Great start to the half 🙄
10661,2020-12-31 03:02:37,kmuz8d,What the fuck is happening
10662,2020-12-31 03:02:45,kmuz8d,LOL what a sequence
10663,2020-12-31 03:03:03,kmuz8d,Good lord
10664,2020-12-31 03:05:21,kmuz8d,We are a fucking TERRIBLE 3 point shooting team apparently. We are bricking wide open shots
10665,2020-12-31 03:05:32,kmuz8d,Today is not the day
10666,2020-12-31 03:05:34,kmuz8d,Over under luka shoots 20% from 3 this year
10667,2020-12-31 03:07:19,kmuz8d,WTF is happening
10668,2020-12-31 03:07:26,kmuz8d,We don’t play like a Play-off team at all
10669,2020-12-31 03:07:40,kmuz8d,"God damn it, if a rebound bounces on the floor and the hornets get it, that’s entirely an effort thing.

And we’re jacking threes. The hornets have gone on an 11-0 run to start the half. Shameful shit"
10670,2020-12-31 03:08:11,kmuz8d,DFS so far this season has been not been able to shoot well
10671,2020-12-31 03:08:21,kmuz8d,And they’re playing with energy and draining everuthing
10672,2020-12-31 03:08:27,kmuz8d,The extra day off did not do us any good
10673,2020-12-31 03:08:30,kmuz8d,When Porzingis comes back? we need him at the rebounds.
10674,2020-12-31 03:08:46,kmuz8d,They play like they just don't care.
10675,2020-12-31 03:08:52,kmuz8d,This is very very bad
10676,2020-12-31 03:09:05,kmuz8d,If graham gets going we’re cooked
10677,2020-12-31 03:09:29,kmuz8d,25... we are getting fucking blown out
10678,2020-12-31 03:09:39,kmuz8d,what the fuck is going on
10679,2020-12-31 03:11:39,kmuz8d,"It’s gotten to the point everytime I see someone get the ball at the 3 point line wide open, I just know they’re gonna brick it. This is terrible."
10680,2020-12-31 03:12:01,kmuz8d,Lmfao I just saw the easiest comeback ever. Easy W guys.
10681,2020-12-31 03:12:07,kmuz8d,"Luka, wtf man? Can't get a 3 to save his life."
10682,2020-12-31 03:12:08,kmuz8d,The body language is actually terrible from the Mavs
10683,2020-12-31 03:12:10,kmuz8d,"1 year of renewed relevancy is all this pathetic team could muster, I’m beyond disappointed"
10684,2020-12-31 03:13:34,kmuz8d,Charlotte running Biyombo post ups now
10685,2020-12-31 03:13:47,kmuz8d,it's over they gave up
10686,2020-12-31 03:13:50,kmuz8d,This is just sad
10687,2020-12-31 03:13:52,kmuz8d,Luka just needs to take over. The offense literally runs through him
10688,2020-12-31 03:14:35,kmuz8d,This is embarrassing
10689,2020-12-31 03:14:37,kmuz8d,"Wow, we going to lose by 50?"
10690,2020-12-31 03:14:45,kmuz8d,3 points. Oof.
10691,2020-12-31 03:14:48,kmuz8d,I want a mavs team that has another offensive identity other than a drive and kick.
10692,2020-12-31 03:14:58,kmuz8d,i aint gonna trip to much on to the next one keep your heads up
10693,2020-12-31 03:15:02,kmuz8d,This is embarassing
10694,2020-12-31 03:15:30,kmuz8d,"I like flush it down & move on mentality, I did it with Suns/Lakers losses. But this turd is not gonna go away easily.

Something is not right with this team."
10695,2020-12-31 03:15:40,kmuz8d, Lol what is rick even doing? Just crossing his arms and not looking at anyone. Calls timeout and slanders a bit around.
10696,2020-12-31 03:16:00,kmuz8d,what sucks more is that the knicks have our picks this year...
10697,2020-12-31 03:16:11,kmuz8d,I actually wonder if the Stephen Silas loss is hurting this team. He was technically the “offensive coordinator” of this team
10698,2020-12-31 03:16:55,kmuz8d,This lineup will bring it back to 10
10699,2020-12-31 03:17:27,kmuz8d,So pathetic
10700,2020-12-31 03:17:29,kmuz8d,We hit a 3? That’s illegal.
10701,2020-12-31 03:18:24,kmuz8d,holy shit. play like you want to win jesus
10702,2020-12-31 03:19:17,kmuz8d,No one wants to shoot anymore 😂😂
10703,2020-12-31 03:19:21,kmuz8d,Luka wtf....can't even get rim now
10704,2020-12-31 03:20:33,kmuz8d,We are getting dick. Good night guys
10705,2020-12-31 03:20:49,kmuz8d,"Wow Luka, shooting with no confidence at all"
10706,2020-12-31 03:20:53,kmuz8d,"Bench everyone, no one cares anyways"
10707,2020-12-31 03:21:13,kmuz8d,I don’t know Luka doesn’t have a normal jumpshot. Just stepbacks or other weird snatch back shit.
10708,2020-12-31 03:21:31,kmuz8d,Luka c’mon man
10709,2020-12-31 03:25:17,kmuz8d,Its the rim ROFL
10710,2020-12-31 03:25:28,kmuz8d,Whats going on lol
10711,2020-12-31 03:26:09,kmuz8d,The whole offense doesn’t seem to be running the same as last year. Luka is just not moving around the same and thus creating as much motion
10712,2020-12-31 03:26:55,kmuz8d,We're gonna have to do what raptors did to us last year in the 4th quarter..
10713,2020-12-31 03:27:02,kmuz8d,Well that was a terrible quarter wasn’t it
10714,2020-12-31 03:27:41,kmuz8d,Luka needs the 3 to open lanes
10715,2020-12-31 03:30:07,kmuz8d,Well at least the bench seems like they give a shit right now.
10716,2020-12-31 03:30:21,kmuz8d,At this point we’re playing for not to be embarrassed in our home opener
10717,2020-12-31 03:41:32,kmuz8d,Lmao what is Hayward doing in the game?
10718,2020-12-31 03:49:11,kmuz8d,"Too bad. It looks like we won't beat the Clippers' record. There's still time, though."
10719,2020-12-31 03:50:20,kmuz8d,Powell is gonna hurt somebody. They better take Hayward out ASAP
10720,2020-12-31 03:50:51,kmuz8d,Brunson should be playing more minutes than Burke more often.
10721,2020-12-31 03:51:07,kmuz8d,In the little time he’s played Wes has looked good.
10722,2020-12-31 03:51:42,kmuz8d,Why did Powell fall on the guy like that. He could have hurt mcdaniels
10723,2020-12-31 03:53:24,kmuz8d,Martin gonna get KO’d if he doesn’t watch himself
10724,2020-12-31 03:53:38,kmuz8d,I wonder what Johnson said to Martin to leave him that pissed
10725,2020-12-31 03:54:52,kmuz8d,rear naked choker incoming
10726,2020-12-31 04:01:38,kmuz8d,That’s it 4 games in and its all over. Time to tank there’s no way it gets any better this year. Hopefully we can trade Luka for a 2022 first.
10727,2020-12-31 03:13:16,kmuz8d,Richardson is killing our spacing. 0/4 and he is wide open!
10728,2020-12-31 02:11:35,kmuz8d,Starting center Dwight Powell has 0 rebounds in 9:40 minutes of playing time
10729,2020-12-31 03:15:12,kmuz8d,This team celebrated on the plane like they had just won the championship on the way back from the Clippers game. They won one fucking game and they thought they were top shit
10730,2020-12-31 03:21:43,kmuz8d,"Luka, don’t listen to these boofs.. keep slangin that rock."
10731,2020-12-31 02:57:52,kmuz8d,This is a cesspool of the worst humanity has to offer.
10732,2020-12-31 03:25:53,kmuz8d,This is a bad team. We’re naive to think KP coming back will fix everything.
10733,2020-12-31 03:26:12,kmuz8d,Bro fuck the stans on this thread. Everyone is ass tonight. Some of you need to smoke a joint or something. Overall shittiness in here
10734,2020-12-31 01:51:17,kmuz8d,all that work chandler parsons put in with powell pump faking finally paid off
10735,2020-12-31 01:54:05,kmuz8d,Powell ffs
10736,2020-12-31 02:06:16,kmuz8d,Luka will be ejected this season.. and it will be a good thing for him.. mark my words
10737,2020-12-31 02:21:14,kmuz8d,"If Hayward is shooting just slightly below average, they’re up nearly 20."
10738,2020-12-31 02:27:50,kmuz8d,We are terrible wtf
10739,2020-12-31 02:33:38,kmuz8d,What happened to the new and improved defense
10740,2020-12-31 02:33:39,kmuz8d,Why are we the most frustrating team in the league
10741,2020-12-31 02:34:48,kmuz8d,Luka really needs to be held accountable for terrible shots
10742,2020-12-31 02:35:01,kmuz8d,Mavs are unraveling. Bruh. How are the hornet owning us
10743,2020-12-31 02:35:14,kmuz8d,Bench Powell now ffs
10744,2020-12-31 02:40:41,kmuz8d,"losing to biyombo and lamelo ball.. we’re supposed to have the mvp front runner, this is unacceptable, even without KP."
10745,2020-12-31 02:40:50,kmuz8d,"Same old MAVS giving opponents bench guys career nights.


Pathetic showing, what's more if Hayward and Rozier  hit their shots, that would be more embarassing. Lol"
10746,2020-12-31 02:40:52,kmuz8d,Lmao has the pandemic made everyone have major issues? This game thread is intense. It's still just basketball
10747,2020-12-31 02:42:29,kmuz8d,Martin attacking Doncic everytime
10748,2020-12-31 02:46:18,kmuz8d,"They made a bunch of bullshit shots, can't helpt that. But the sloppyness on offense, my lord..."
10749,2020-12-31 02:46:56,kmuz8d,6 missed FTs points more to a mentality thing right now
10750,2020-12-31 02:47:42,kmuz8d,This team ain’t going nowhere
10751,2020-12-31 02:51:54,kmuz8d,Richardson 1/6. Yikes!
10752,2020-12-31 02:52:44,kmuz8d,"I really think we gonna end up running Moreyball around Luka at some point, just seems like that type of player, he works better with high efficiency and touches."
10753,2020-12-31 03:06:52,kmuz8d,Thank god we didn't add any talent this summer.
10754,2020-12-31 03:07:49,kmuz8d,"lmao “this is who we are this is how we want to be judged” - after one good game 

*absolute dog shit in every other game*"
10755,2020-12-31 03:14:43,kmuz8d,Remember how so many on this sub were going *gugu-gaga* over offseason photos of Luka playing fortnight and getting fat? Not so cute now is it lol.
10756,2020-12-31 03:17:22,kmuz8d,"Fucking pathetic effort, no other way around it. Only positive is that this game 4 of a 72 game season."
10757,2020-12-31 03:19:01,kmuz8d,Why so many knicks fans in this thread?
10758,2020-12-31 03:28:37,kmuz8d,"Man there is still another quarter to go.. This team looks like they want to forfeit. Very bad night, but we've seen them perform. Once KP gets back and we get more comfortable I think we will be an above average team, maybe 7 or 8 seed."
10759,2020-12-31 03:39:41,kmuz8d,Rick told Powell no chicken tenders after the game if he doesn’t go out there and give it his all on the glass against the scrubs
10760,2020-12-31 02:05:18,kmuz8d,[deleted]
10761,2020-12-31 03:29:35,kmuz8d,“Once KP gets back...” holy shit the denial. The same thing was said last year about our choking. He came back and we still sucked. This team just ain’t it
10762,2020-12-31 03:24:43,kmuz8d,"i’m deleting the app. literally never getting on r/mavericks again. buncha toxic ass whiners. i just can’t take it anymore





see y’all friday"
10763,2020-12-31 02:31:06,kmuz8d,This is literally the Lakers game yet again. However we don’t have the excuse of coming up against ad and Lebron. We’re just dogshit
10764,2020-12-31 02:44:13,kmuz8d,Brunson can not run an offense
10765,2020-12-31 03:08:13,kmuz8d,"Wow that sucks. Going to stop watching, where's fucking Bubble Luka. I've seen enough."
10766,2020-12-31 03:21:01,kmuz8d,Gotta be weird playing at your home stadium without fans. Also having the crowd noise pumped in. Different than the bubble. Could also explain why so many home teams are getting blown out
10767,2020-12-31 03:22:28,kmuz8d,Lamelo Ball outplaying Luka. Wow.
10768,2020-12-31 03:32:01,kmuz8d,I’m pretty concerned about how Luka yelled at Rick after that 3rd foul
10769,2020-12-31 03:35:20,kmuz8d,22 point game boys! We got this!
10770,2020-12-31 03:49:50,kmuz8d,"Cant believe im gonna say this, but r/nba game thread was miles better than whatever this is/was."
10771,2020-12-31 02:49:35,kmuz8d,Not looking forward to the inevitable trae>Luka discussions
10772,2020-12-31 03:10:01,kmuz8d,"Knicks are going to get a lottery pick, we are garbage"
10773,2020-12-31 02:44:37,kmuz8d,luka got anger issues
10774,2020-12-31 01:54:11,kmuz8d,Kleber absolutely needs to start.
10775,2020-12-31 01:54:34,kmuz8d,I wish I could watch the Mavs but Frontier doesn’t have FSSW anymore :(
10776,2020-12-31 01:58:43,kmuz8d,Looks like the AAC curse is alive and well. We still blow at home
10777,2020-12-31 02:10:53,kmuz8d,powell not even doing anything bad this game YET
10778,2020-12-31 02:13:18,kmuz8d,"We're gonna be in the same situation as Suns last season.  
We suck, and we'll make excuses all year... just to miss the playoffs."
10779,2020-12-31 02:18:27,kmuz8d,WCS getting dunked on is dwights fault
10780,2020-12-31 02:18:29,kmuz8d,oh man LaMelo is cooking us.
10781,2020-12-31 02:20:10,kmuz8d,Hornets dominating us
10782,2020-12-31 02:31:43,kmuz8d,We’re getting dominated. Borrego coaches his guys up. They’re going to steal another in Dallas.
10783,2020-12-31 02:33:32,kmuz8d,"Fuck, this is embarrassing."
10784,2020-12-31 02:34:27,kmuz8d,Did Luka forget how to shoot a 3???
10785,2020-12-31 02:34:35,kmuz8d,We have got to stop playing Powell such heavy minutes. He’s doing nothing positively right now.
10786,2020-12-31 02:34:43,kmuz8d,Damnit. Luka I know you’re upset but don’t start doing that out of anger
10787,2020-12-31 02:34:50,kmuz8d, Can please Powell leave the floor ? This is emberrassing.
10788,2020-12-31 02:35:13,kmuz8d,IN WHAT WORLD DOES IT MAKE SENSE FOR DWIGHT TO SHOOT A THREE
10789,2020-12-31 02:35:15,kmuz8d,Powell... is disturbing...
10790,2020-12-31 02:36:33,kmuz8d,I think Skin is the worst part of this so far... makes it awk
10791,2020-12-31 02:37:07,kmuz8d,Get powell off the floor for the love of god Rick. I wear our offense is so dogshit with hom on the floor every fkn time.
10792,2020-12-31 02:39:05,kmuz8d,This team is still soft asf... no wonder we make runs when Johnson is in
10793,2020-12-31 02:39:29,kmuz8d,Lamelo making us look like amateurs
10794,2020-12-31 02:39:30,kmuz8d,This is not good... How tf is LaMelo going off like this lol
10795,2020-12-31 02:40:00,kmuz8d,Fucking trash effort by this team.
10796,2020-12-31 02:40:26,kmuz8d,Are we really gonna get blown out by the Hornets?
10797,2020-12-31 03:02:56,kmuz8d,Lakers game all over again
10798,2020-12-31 03:04:39,kmuz8d,"I used to laugh at the people saying we should have got Drummond

Honestly though, he would have ticked many boxes"
10799,2020-12-31 03:05:19,kmuz8d,20 point lead lmao
10800,2020-12-31 03:10:06,kmuz8d,“Oh know we suck again!”
10801,2020-12-31 03:10:15,kmuz8d,"Defense isn’t even that bad, these dudes are shooting like 2016 curry"
10802,2020-12-31 03:14:39,kmuz8d,this team is trash
10803,2020-12-31 03:15:27,kmuz8d,#bring seth back pls
10804,2020-12-31 03:20:58,kmuz8d,Watch the Hornets shoot nowhere near this well their next game. It's always against us that teams have their best nights it seems
10805,2020-12-31 03:26:19,kmuz8d,"Luka looks out of shape and then on a shooting slump. Plus, he doesnt have the same spacing like he had last year. Kleber should just replace Powell in the starting lineup and Mavs should rethink about Richardson's offensive fit beside Luka."
10806,2020-12-31 03:32:27,kmuz8d,its nothing powell can do to be benched lol
10807,2020-12-31 03:39:58,kmuz8d,Only 22 with 8;20 left... we can still do it
10808,2020-12-31 03:20:13,kmuz8d,"Trae Young is even better than he was last year. Luka has regressed.

This is just the reality at this point"
10809,2020-12-31 02:03:28,kmuz8d,Thats why WCS should start
10810,2020-12-31 02:05:48,kmuz8d,Luka needs to chill. Please.
10811,2020-12-31 02:09:35,kmuz8d,"This game is infuriating, there is no reason this team should be down 5 rn..."
10812,2020-12-31 02:11:18,kmuz8d,"Powell is Carlisle's favorite guy, never not gonna get playing time no matter how much he sucks outside of rolling."
10813,2020-12-31 02:15:03,kmuz8d,"We’re down 3 in the second quarter and we’ve got Wackjobs talking about rick needs to be fired because he starts Powell. 

Let that sink in and realize how shitty our sub is. 

Every MFFL should be ashamed"
10814,2020-12-31 02:27:42,kmuz8d,"I know we haven't played LaMelo good, but he IS good. You can tell he's got the juice."
10815,2020-12-31 02:31:50,kmuz8d,"Oh my fucking God dude... I can’t take this any more.... this fucking team is so FRUSTRATING... refs, opposing teams shooting like the globetrotters, turnovers, stupid plays, brick after brick AFTER BRICK

WHAT THE FUUUUUUUCKKKKKKK"
10816,2020-12-31 03:22:56,kmuz8d,Luka needs to get back in shape and everything will follow.
10817,2020-12-31 01:54:53,kmuz8d,Dwight Powell is fucking terrible
10818,2020-12-31 02:48:04,kmuz8d,I want to remind everyone in this thread we resigned WCS the same time Toronto picked up Baynes. A few days later the Kings signed Whiteside for 2M. Baynes is an elite charge taker and Whiteside is a good value pick up at 2M.
10819,2020-12-31 03:23:57,kmuz8d,"Gotta love all the talk about defense during training camp only for the offense to look significantly worse and the defense to look about the same.
Thanks Mark, Donnie, and Rick!"
10820,2020-12-31 03:24:05,kmuz8d,can the rookies get minutes now? why is rick so stubborn with these rotations. he plays the same three rotations and sticks with that no matter what
10821,2020-12-31 03:26:11,kmuz8d,Rick just won't give up his love on Powell lol
10822,2020-12-31 03:36:53,kmuz8d,"Correct me if im wrong, but we need a real big in free agency, just kp wont cut it, so would drummond be a better option than oladipo?"
10823,2020-12-31 02:27:34,kmuz8d,"Too many of Y’all don’t know how to just enjoy a game 

If it’s not going our way., too many of y’all turn into whiners that can’t handle the heat. 

There’s plenty ball to be played, just watch and be positive. Stop crying"
10824,2020-12-31 02:52:13,kmuz8d,"Well the Hawks are definitely better than the Mavs so far.
Their front office was aggressive. Credit to them."
10825,2020-12-31 02:38:27,kmuz8d,"Honestly, are we a playoff team at this point?"
10826,2020-12-31 03:39:40,kmuz8d,Luka has been bad this year no way around it
10827,2020-12-31 01:30:31,kmuz8d,J-Rich on Rozier is going to be fun.
10828,2020-12-31 01:35:01,kmuz8d,Need that long sleeve shirt ASAP
10829,2020-12-31 01:39:13,kmuz8d,LET'S GO MAVS!
10830,2020-12-31 01:40:53,kmuz8d,It's almost nostalgic hearing our in-arena announcer
10831,2020-12-31 01:41:21,kmuz8d,Can’t underestimate these Hornets
10832,2020-12-31 01:41:35,kmuz8d,"Once again, fuck Sinclair Broadcast Group"
10833,2020-12-31 01:42:33,kmuz8d,oh...Dwight
10834,2020-12-31 01:43:11,kmuz8d,"Let's goooo, I'm feeling confident this game"
10835,2020-12-31 01:45:46,kmuz8d,Luka gonna fuck this team up if he keeps getting into the lane like that
10836,2020-12-31 01:45:50,kmuz8d,Who has a stream link? Streak East is ass
10837,2020-12-31 01:46:10,kmuz8d,anyone with a stream from the hornets feed?
10838,2020-12-31 01:46:54,kmuz8d,[deleted]
10839,2020-12-31 01:48:27,kmuz8d,Links to the game -  [http://nbastream.tv/2030-charlotte-hornets-dallas-mavericks-2/](http://nbastream.tv/2030-charlotte-hornets-dallas-mavericks-2/) or [http://freestreams-live1.com/dallas-mavericks-live-streamz/](http://freestreams-live1.com/dallas-mavericks-live-streamz/)
10840,2020-12-31 01:48:48,kmuz8d,Great start so far
10841,2020-12-31 01:49:16,kmuz8d,Made up for those missed free throws
10842,2020-12-31 01:49:30,kmuz8d,im getting blow out vibes from this game
10843,2020-12-31 01:49:32,kmuz8d,"Luka wearing a brace on the right ankle, carrying over from practice yesterday."
10844,2020-12-31 01:50:16,kmuz8d,I know it's a miniscule sample size but I think Luka is feeling more confident at the FT line throughout this games.
10845,2020-12-31 01:50:26,kmuz8d,This energy on defense is so likeable
10846,2020-12-31 01:50:59,kmuz8d,Lol sometimes I read comments and the stuff happens like 30 seconds later in my stream. Feels bad man
10847,2020-12-31 01:51:26,kmuz8d,THJ wtf
10848,2020-12-31 01:51:30,kmuz8d,Powell was watching those Roby highlights from last night all day
10849,2020-12-31 01:52:32,kmuz8d,Me too Harp...
10850,2020-12-31 01:52:52,kmuz8d,This defense looks super focused and lots of effort
10851,2020-12-31 01:54:31,kmuz8d,everytime Luka dosent have the ball I fear a turnover
10852,2020-12-31 01:54:50,kmuz8d,"Uh, is the NBA network hq in Charlotte or what?"
10853,2020-12-31 01:55:29,kmuz8d,Oh maxi...
10854,2020-12-31 01:56:54,kmuz8d,tf was that hesitation
10855,2020-12-31 01:58:35,kmuz8d,You couldnt ask for better looks Doncic is giving them and they still miss!
10856,2020-12-31 01:58:54,kmuz8d,can anyone dm me a link to a stream? FSSW being removed from my god damn tv package is really killing me right now.
10857,2020-12-31 02:00:07,kmuz8d,This game has been pretty annoying so far
10858,2020-12-31 02:00:15,kmuz8d,Should have known this would be a tight one.
10859,2020-12-31 02:00:26,kmuz8d,Luka went Giannis from 3
10860,2020-12-31 02:01:00,kmuz8d,MAXI

10868,2020-12-31 02:02:51,kmuz8d,i can’t wait for bleacher report to suck lamelos dick tonight
10869,2020-12-31 02:02:55,kmuz8d,Lamelo looks like Hammy from over the hedge when he has caffeine. It looks like every step he takes has 17 jitters.
10870,2020-12-31 02:03:33,kmuz8d,Not Against MAXI!
10871,2020-12-31 02:03:43,kmuz8d,DAT PASS
10872,2020-12-31 02:04:50,kmuz8d,"Wow dude, how is that not a foul?"
10873,2020-12-31 02:04:58,kmuz8d,Hornets have no rim protection with that line up
10874,2020-12-31 02:05:35,kmuz8d,Attack Timmy
10875,2020-12-31 02:06:11,kmuz8d,We should not be losing this game!!

10877,2020-12-31 02:06:30,kmuz8d,What are these shitty refs doing. So many missed calls against Mavs
10878,2020-12-31 02:06:52,kmuz8d,Maxi is the best player in the league.
10879,2020-12-31 02:06:58,kmuz8d,How is that a technical

10882,2020-12-31 02:07:13,kmuz8d,Can someone DM a working streaming link for tonight's game?
10883,2020-12-31 02:07:22,kmuz8d,Lol technical on James Johnson
10884,2020-12-31 02:08:22,kmuz8d,Maxi is just hamming right now.
10885,2020-12-31 02:08:41,kmuz8d,Wtf was that turnover
10886,2020-12-31 02:08:49,kmuz8d,Threeber heat check
10887,2020-12-31 02:10:48,kmuz8d,Shot a better percentage from the field down by 7 WELCOME TO THE NBA
10888,2020-12-31 02:10:58,kmuz8d,We cant lose this fucking game
10889,2020-12-31 02:12:46,kmuz8d,Love it when Melo gets highlights posted just for  making a 3
10890,2020-12-31 02:13:17,kmuz8d,There you go Timmy
10891,2020-12-31 02:13:21,kmuz8d,The James Johnson screen and pass special to Timmy.

10893,2020-12-31 02:14:36,kmuz8d,THJ is turning up tonight.
10894,2020-12-31 02:14:38,kmuz8d,Nice pass by James Johnson. Flashy

10896,2020-12-31 02:15:57,kmuz8d,let’s go timmy
10897,2020-12-31 02:16:02,kmuz8d,"Another James Johnson setup to Timmy. I agree with our announcers, JJ playmaking seems underrated."
10898,2020-12-31 02:16:12,kmuz8d,Johnson behind the back passes go crazy.This dude can be our 2nd playmaker on the bench.
10899,2020-12-31 02:16:15,kmuz8d,Really like this bench unit
10900,2020-12-31 02:16:24,kmuz8d,“yessir”

10906,2020-12-31 02:17:44,kmuz8d,"Good stuff, James"
10907,2020-12-31 02:17:49,kmuz8d,Lol James
10908,2020-12-31 02:17:52,kmuz8d,"sit down, biyombo"
10909,2020-12-31 02:18:07,kmuz8d,Good play by JB!
10910,2020-12-31 02:18:09,kmuz8d,Jesus fucking christ how much luck can one team have
10911,2020-12-31 02:18:10,kmuz8d,Get a body on Bismack
10912,2020-12-31 02:18:13,kmuz8d,Legit did not know Biyombo was still in the league
10913,2020-12-31 02:18:15,kmuz8d,imagine getting postered by Bismarck Biyombo lol
10914,2020-12-31 02:19:27,kmuz8d,Show the replay you cowards.
10915,2020-12-31 02:19:27,kmuz8d,Hornets coach needa trim that fucking beard
10916,2020-12-31 02:19:59,kmuz8d,Is Heyward any good now? It seems like every game I saw of him when he was on Boston he sucked
10917,2020-12-31 02:21:34,kmuz8d,TIM PLAYING 6 FEET OFF ONE PASS AWAY THANKS
10918,2020-12-31 02:23:06,kmuz8d,Hayward bailing our asses right now
10919,2020-12-31 02:23:11,kmuz8d,Hayward is having a rough night
10920,2020-12-31 02:23:28,kmuz8d,"Honestly, other than THJ and James Johnson no one has had a lot of touches. They haven’t come in the groove yet."
10921,2020-12-31 02:24:07,kmuz8d,"Just gotta keep fighting, their bench can’t keep up shooting 100% from the floor."
10922,2020-12-31 02:24:30,kmuz8d,James Johnson makes hustle plays without even looking like he's trying to
10923,2020-12-31 02:28:24,kmuz8d,I’m forced to listen to the hornet commentators and they make me want to kill someone
10924,2020-12-31 02:29:08,kmuz8d,Lmao
10925,2020-12-31 02:30:08,kmuz8d,We can’t seem to get over that five point difference.
10926,2020-12-31 02:32:36,kmuz8d,KP can’t come back soon enough
10927,2020-12-31 02:32:40,kmuz8d,Mavs don't want to win tonight. The effort in everything is just sorry.
10928,2020-12-31 02:33:09,kmuz8d,"We are being outhustled. Rebounding is so bad, even guys like Luka who are normaly good rebounders are atavking the ball so fucking lazy."
10929,2020-12-31 02:33:35,kmuz8d,LMFAO
10930,2020-12-31 02:35:06,kmuz8d,Uhhhhhhmmmm
10931,2020-12-31 02:35:19,kmuz8d,This is so frustrating
10932,2020-12-31 02:35:20,kmuz8d,Just tuned in. Why????
10933,2020-12-31 02:35:44,kmuz8d,"Man, are we bad today"
10934,2020-12-31 02:35:56,kmuz8d,Why are we leaving them so open on threes lol
10935,2020-12-31 02:36:03,kmuz8d,This is the worst...
10936,2020-12-31 02:36:11,kmuz8d,We look so lost on offense christ
10937,2020-12-31 02:36:13,kmuz8d,What the fuck is happening lol
10938,2020-12-31 02:36:19,kmuz8d,Finally got a bucket
10939,2020-12-31 02:36:40,kmuz8d,Too many dumb TOs
10940,2020-12-31 02:37:44,kmuz8d,no matter how good the defense
10941,2020-12-31 02:38:17,kmuz8d,"Our players are good, but they are so fucking dumb sometimes"
10942,2020-12-31 02:39:14,kmuz8d,Embarrassing.
10943,2020-12-31 02:41:26,kmuz8d,Feel like he stepped over DFS unnecessarily to start with..
10944,2020-12-31 02:41:29,kmuz8d,I wish I could watch the game:/
10945,2020-12-31 02:41:29,kmuz8d,Lamelo Ball is schooling us we need to wake the fuck up
10946,2020-12-31 02:42:31,kmuz8d,Please just make a decent run
10947,2020-12-31 02:42:38,kmuz8d,Timmy really picked a good time to shoot well
10948,2020-12-31 02:45:43,kmuz8d,(Stink emoji)
10949,2020-12-31 02:46:18,kmuz8d,Nice end to the quarter
10950,2020-12-31 02:56:17,kmuz8d,Wth is this game??
10951,2020-12-31 02:56:26,kmuz8d,why is luka playing more timid this season?
10952,2020-12-31 02:58:44,kmuz8d,Can someone pm me a link to a stream? I’m tired of listening to the Charlotte announcers
10953,2020-12-31 03:02:33,kmuz8d,Hornets are having fun
10954,2020-12-31 03:02:59,kmuz8d,no double team on the post up + unlucky lob + bad gamble for a steal from Luka = this start for the half
10955,2020-12-31 03:04:13,kmuz8d,Luka needs to make at least 6 3s in this half for us to have a chance lol
10956,2020-12-31 03:04:47,kmuz8d,"I get that was a bad start to the half, but I hate TOs like that lol. It was one sequence, you gotta wait and see a bit"
10957,2020-12-31 03:05:27,kmuz8d,Luka what was that shot selection bro
10958,2020-12-31 03:05:41,kmuz8d,big baller brand type of shooting night
10959,2020-12-31 03:06:08,kmuz8d,bruh
10960,2020-12-31 03:06:10,kmuz8d,Good god we look bad on both sides of the ball right now
10961,2020-12-31 03:06:22,kmuz8d,Are Rozier’s sideburns disconnected from the rest of his hair?
10962,2020-12-31 03:06:29,kmuz8d,Holy fuck we couldn’t buy a shot.
10963,2020-12-31 03:06:33,kmuz8d,Geez there’s just a lid on the rim and they can’t miss.
10964,2020-12-31 03:06:56,kmuz8d,They should take it more easy on that rim.
10965,2020-12-31 03:07:28,kmuz8d,Can’t buy a bucket. God our 3 point shooting is awful tonight
10966,2020-12-31 03:07:37,kmuz8d,we have serious problems
10967,2020-12-31 03:07:37,kmuz8d,Luka gotta start getting selfish
10968,2020-12-31 03:09:16,kmuz8d,Make a damn free throw
10969,2020-12-31 03:11:07,kmuz8d,"When mavs git shots we hit, but when we dont nothing just goes in"
10970,2020-12-31 03:12:01,kmuz8d,give luka the ball dfs aint doing good rn
10971,2020-12-31 03:12:12,kmuz8d,Having trouble rebounding? Go zone! Lol.
10972,2020-12-31 03:12:52,kmuz8d,I thought if you got that much of the ball the follow through didnt count as a foul?
10973,2020-12-31 03:12:53,kmuz8d,this is getting funny tho seeing this many bricks
10974,2020-12-31 03:13:55,kmuz8d,What’s wrong?
10975,2020-12-31 03:14:18,kmuz8d,so many bricks
10976,2020-12-31 03:14:50,kmuz8d,They have the audacity to guard Luka with Terry Rozier. Last year Luka wouldve feasted on such a small guard
10977,2020-12-31 03:14:51,kmuz8d,Just sub everyone off fuck it
10978,2020-12-31 03:15:34,kmuz8d,"Nobody drinks that Biosteel, do they?"
10979,2020-12-31 03:16:13,kmuz8d,I just checked the box score....and....have we really been outscored 20-3 in the 3rd quarter?
10980,2020-12-31 03:16:38,kmuz8d,HORRIBLE
10981,2020-12-31 03:17:41,kmuz8d,This team is so confusing.
10982,2020-12-31 03:17:43,kmuz8d,Richardson can’t get it out of his hands fast enough. Get someone else in there. He’s shook.
10983,2020-12-31 03:19:05,kmuz8d,Wow
10984,2020-12-31 03:19:34,kmuz8d,Pathetic defense
10985,2020-12-31 03:20:24,kmuz8d,This is the fucking Hornets doing this to us.
10986,2020-12-31 03:20:29,kmuz8d,Good thing there's no all star game this season.
10987,2020-12-31 03:20:32,kmuz8d,Stop shooting the 3 luka....
10988,2020-12-31 03:21:00,kmuz8d,Aight if they were gonna shoot like this then it was an unwinnable game
10989,2020-12-31 03:21:12,kmuz8d,What the fuck is happening
10990,2020-12-31 03:21:55,kmuz8d,Man i cant wait for kp
10991,2020-12-31 03:21:56,kmuz8d,Go next. Give rookies time. Reset for next game.
10992,2020-12-31 03:22:40,kmuz8d,brickbrickbrickbrickbrick lmao
10993,2020-12-31 03:24:20,kmuz8d,Rex Kwan Doe lololol
10994,2020-12-31 03:24:55,kmuz8d,This quarter has been HILARIOUS.
10995,2020-12-31 03:26:24,kmuz8d,I don't believe playing boban would make the defence worse
10996,2020-12-31 03:28:14,kmuz8d,We at home but bobody can hit shit
10997,2020-12-31 03:30:30,kmuz8d,Good start
10998,2020-12-31 03:31:10,kmuz8d,Great start 😬
10999,2020-12-31 03:31:30,kmuz8d,Game already.  Only way to win now is to score 30 and hold them scoreless. Ain't happening.
11000,2020-12-31 03:31:31,kmuz8d,trey fucking burke
11001,2020-12-31 03:50:10,kmuz8d,Green playing well
11002,2020-12-31 03:50:55,kmuz8d,Ayy boban is on
11003,2020-12-31 03:52:32,kmuz8d,This team lacks a vet that can keep these guys heads into the game. We are just lost out there
11004,2020-12-31 03:52:33,kmuz8d,Tempers flare in Dallas
11005,2020-12-31 03:01:38,kmuz8d,"Some of y’all need to take a chill pill. Yes it sucks that we are playing badly, yes I wish we were rebounding better, Luka looked in better shape hit his 3’s etc. But damn sometimes just enjoy the game as best as you can, it’s supposed to be entertainment!"
11006,2020-12-31 03:34:54,kmuz8d,where the fuck is boban
11007,2020-12-31 03:41:45,kmuz8d,Been saying it since he left Detroit: Let’s. Get. Drummond.
11008,2020-12-31 03:33:25,kmuz8d,Sorry but this team won't make it to the playoffs.
11009,2020-12-31 02:36:33,kmuz8d,Also LaMelo is a good player
11010,2020-12-31 03:33:02,kmuz8d,It is already over yet Rick is still sticking up with Powell lol
11011,2020-12-31 02:04:51,kmuz8d,"Why the fuck is Powell back in he only sat 3 minutes

Just leak Carlisle’s nudes already man fuck"
11012,2020-12-31 02:09:00,kmuz8d,"whew, lamelo"
11013,2020-12-31 02:11:55,kmuz8d,There's a reason Powell was only +12 in a 51 point blowout win
11014,2020-12-31 02:17:18,kmuz8d,"Dwight Powell must be a ""good culture guy"" or a faithful practice guy. But for the life of me I do not know what in the past 4 years has made Rick Carlisle so determined to play him when better options were available. Heck, even if there weren't, just trying something different because the dude was sucking isn't even in consideration. The infuriating thing is we'll never get a straight answer from him about it."
11015,2020-12-31 02:34:52,kmuz8d,"I will never understand what Rick sees in Powell, he was never that good even when healthy, his rim rolling efficiency is overstated."
11016,2020-12-31 02:37:32,kmuz8d,rick finally giving maxi powell’s minutes it looks like
11017,2020-12-31 02:38:57,kmuz8d,Bad rebounding and poor free throw shooting reflect a team’s lack of effort and discipline.
11018,2020-12-31 02:39:25,kmuz8d,This game is over
11019,2020-12-31 03:22:16,kmuz8d,"I see a lot of doom and glooming shit talkers, but keep a lid on it until we saw how this team looks when our highest paid player gets back"
11020,2020-12-31 03:27:00,kmuz8d,I can't take this anymore. I'm out. Mavs didn't want this game it seems. They came out sluggish and lazy. The hornets were super active and deserved the win. GG.
11021,2020-12-31 02:20:34,kmuz8d,"Skin is such a homer man, trying to shit on LaMelo for what would have been a fantastic pass...smh."
11022,2020-12-31 02:55:51,kmuz8d,Is funny how people blame y the guy with 28 and 6 assists per game LOL
11023,2020-12-31 03:54:44,kmuz8d,This is not a playoff team ladies and gentlemen. Sad Luka didn't take his health seriously and decided to show up to the season fat as fuck
11024,2020-12-30 17:14:12,kmuz8d,"I have the International Legue Pass but right now I’m in Orlando for the Holidays, will I have any trouble watching the game, or should I be fine?"
11025,2020-12-31 01:29:43,kmuz8d,"Powell Is our best player this season easily. I’m so happy he is starting, well deserved. Best contract in the league, easily. Have you seen his rolls? Or PUMP FAKES, give him a contract extension."
11026,2020-12-31 01:50:33,kmuz8d,Powell’s Pump fake Party™️
11027,2020-12-31 01:54:39,kmuz8d,bench Powell
11028,2020-12-31 02:05:00,kmuz8d,why did Willie get pulled so quickly after b2b dunks?
11029,2020-12-31 02:12:34,kmuz8d,Drummond starting to look real good right about now
11030,2020-12-31 02:16:22,kmuz8d,"Where was that strength during the block attempt, Willie?!"
11031,2020-12-31 02:18:39,kmuz8d,[deleted]
11032,2020-12-31 02:25:26,kmuz8d,"it's okay, powell will come back in and fuck it all up"
11033,2020-12-31 02:25:34,kmuz8d,This is an irritating game.
11034,2020-12-31 02:27:32,kmuz8d,How is Lamelo shooting better from 3 than Luka?
11035,2020-12-31 02:31:05,kmuz8d,shambolic defense
11036,2020-12-31 02:31:47,kmuz8d,Can Powell get an offensive rebound WTF
11037,2020-12-31 02:31:55,kmuz8d,Maybe some guys can open another sub where they can all talk together how bad Powell has been? Would help a lot for threads like this.
11038,2020-12-31 02:34:08,kmuz8d,Powell from three.. Bang Bang.. oh wait..
11039,2020-12-31 02:34:42,kmuz8d,...ok Dwight. Alright. Ok.

11045,2020-12-31 02:35:45,kmuz8d,Wow Powell's 3 ball was closer than Luka's. We're in trouble.

11069,2020-12-31 02:41:15,kmuz8d,Imagine complaining after beating the Clippers by 51 points.
11070,2020-12-31 03:14:55,kmuz8d,"Wow this is genuinely just a bad basketball team. No bullshit, it’s just purely a bad basketball team. No if’s buts or maybes, it’s just dog shit"

11072,2020-12-31 02:49:17,kmuz8d,"Don’t even know what to say. The effort was awful. This team is a disappointment so far. The Clippers game was simply an anomaly - any other NBA team could have won that game that day.
Won’t even say more on the coaching, but it has not been good."

The rest of the team just isn’t very talented. It’s not that they are really playing that bad, they just aren’t as good as most opposing teams. It is what it is."
11080,2020-12-31 03:14:24,kmuz8d,"BTW, excellent coaching lol. Rick wont be here next year"
11081,2020-12-31 03:27:07,kmuz8d,Luka can’t continue his unprofessionalism if he wants to maintain a long career in the league
11082,2020-12-31 03:10:42,kmuz8d,"I watched Mavs games last year cause  I am massive Luka fan but its been evident how massive the Curry lost has been. The gravity Seth just gives Luka is nearly the same as what Porzingis gives him. Teams wont put an extra body on him when he drives the paint since they have to always watch out for Seth. Richardson isnt exactly a ""gravity"" offensive player in spite of being a better defensive player."
11083,2020-12-31 01:05:05,kmuz8d,If we don't win by 52 this thread will start freaking out again.

This game is a write off cuz from minute 1 we got out played out worked and out hustled. Let this be a learning moment. We will get nowhere without aggressiveness and playing w lethargy. We’ve had good looks and we’re just not hitting it’s not a coaching problem just an off night. Scrap this and refresh

11092,2020-12-31 02:27:27,kmuz8d,Powell missed that dunk?  Good lord....
11093,2020-12-31 02:31:56,kmuz8d,Luka needs to fucking do something. Powell have has been fucking useless.
11094,2020-12-31 02:46:20,kmuz8d,Doncic and KP are the only guys that can reliably turn it on on offense. This is why we need a third piece. And no THJ and JRich are not the third piece.

11147,2020-12-31 03:31:39,kmuz8d,"Just reposting my take from the unpopular thread today in r/nba in here today

I think DSJ can be a starting point guard in the league.

Trade Dwight Powell for Lou Williams.

Luka being “fat” is mostly a dumb meme (would rather a young dude coming off a high use season rest up than overtrain.)

There are so many question marks about KP’s long term durability that it shouldn’t be out of the question to trade him. (I like KP and he’s great when healthy, but him and Doncic have still struggled a fair bit together, and I was downvoted saying the FO would like trade KP for Jokic, Giannis, or Harden, respectively)

The Mavs image is a little too white and it hurts our chances at big name free agents

THJ is just not that great and is overpaid. Last year’s shooting stats are inflated because of Luka. His decision making and play making holds him back.

Luka will not be as loyal as Dirk and our timeline to make deep playoff runs is not as long as many think.

WCS and Trey Burke were majorly important off-season upgrades in the off-season.

Our draft this year was not very impressive.

We can simmer down with the Dwade hate (he’s an all time great who’s by all accounts a classy dude - but still fuck rondo though)

I wish we had signed Melo or Boogie on a vet min

If we had signed Jimmy Butler we’d be a WCF level team

Our off-season was half way decent but we still have a lot of question marks and I don’t think we are a top 5 western conference team right now, though I’d love to be proven wrong.

Wow that was therapeutic to get that all out."
11148,2020-12-31 02:09:37,kmuz8d,melo is so fucking good
11149,2020-12-31 02:38:38,kmuz8d,KP alone aint saving this team we need to get a trade by the deadline

11190,2020-12-31 03:54:33,kmuz8d,"Good, we need that shit. Way too much apathy on this team."
11191,2020-12-30 20:11:59,kmuz8d,"I made a bingo thread for the last game I think but I am not very good around computers so I wasn't able to make a bingo card, if there is anyone willing to do it that would be great!"
11192,2020-12-31 02:54:58,kmuz8d,"Rick is so stubborn when it comes to DP. He has to know he’s a liability, but i guess he’s hoping he’ll turn it around"
11193,2020-12-31 03:33:10,kmuz8d,"I think his mom is. Luka, I made your favorite hot pockets!"
11194,2020-12-31 03:33:51,kmuz8d,I did see him grilling after the Clippers game. Don’t know what he had though.
11195,2020-12-31 03:38:56,kmuz8d,but this sub told me he was in fine shape and not to worry?
11196,2020-12-31 02:46:37,kmuz8d,Mostly bc hes our best rebounder. We have a problem when our best rebounder is Luka...he’s a decent rebounder but he shouldn’t be our best rebounder.
11197,2020-12-31 03:03:02,kmuz8d,That's some Brook Lopez shit.
11198,2020-12-31 03:26:21,kmuz8d,"> is going to fuck him up this season

It's already fucking him and the team."
11199,2020-12-31 03:14:07,kmuz8d,He’ll bounce back eventually; hopefully much sooner than later
11200,2020-12-31 03:14:53,kmuz8d,He was definitely better to start last season.
11201,2020-12-31 03:21:42,kmuz8d,Because we are right now.
11202,2020-12-31 03:26:30,kmuz8d,He's not even shooting bad shots. He's missing normal shots.
11203,2020-12-31 01:47:12,kmuz8d,Maxi and DFS are definitely moving up my list of all time Mavs.
11204,2020-12-31 02:29:53,kmuz8d,"It’s almost like the defender grabbed his fucking wrist. 

You couldn’t dunk on a 5 foot goal and your sitting there talking that shit. Lol"
11205,2020-12-31 02:45:16,kmuz8d,Just like his older brother
11206,2020-12-31 02:46:26,kmuz8d,Tbh the bar is pretty low
11207,2020-12-31 02:47:44,kmuz8d,"Yeah he looks like he could be better than Lonzo, pretty impressive tbh"
11208,2020-12-31 04:03:21,kmuz8d,Very true! Needed that positivity.
11209,2020-12-31 02:54:34,kmuz8d,"Yeah that is insane, that might be one of the best bench metrics I have seen in a while."
11210,2020-12-31 02:57:38,kmuz8d,Its like better than open gym shooting lol. Absolutely absurd.
11211,2020-12-31 03:00:55,kmuz8d,"Yes, but Heyward and Rozier won't suck all night long, either."
11212,2020-12-31 03:16:29,kmuz8d,"So if we win by 50 one time it's all credit to Rick, but when we have the same problems with rebounds, effort, and defense with 3 different rosters over 3 different years, it's not Rick's fault?"
11213,2020-12-31 03:27:30,kmuz8d,you should post this
11214,2020-12-31 03:29:01,kmuz8d,"If that's the game I think it was, KP was trash too and yet we still managed to beat Denver on the road.

That was a weird one."
11215,2020-12-31 03:28:56,kmuz8d,YOU’RE BRINGING RESEARCH INTO THIS!?!?!
11216,2020-12-31 03:44:12,kmuz8d,Yeah I can’t believe Rick gave up on this game with 4 mins left in the third
11217,2020-12-31 03:47:49,kmuz8d,"It is not, last year against the spurs he scored 10 points, missed 10 free throws althouth that was his first game coming back from injury."
11218,2020-12-31 02:47:48,kmuz8d,He is so God awful
11219,2020-12-31 02:47:44,kmuz8d,Oof
11220,2020-12-31 02:48:10,kmuz8d,This is really clear.
11221,2020-12-31 02:50:08,kmuz8d,Cant wait for KP to come back to take his minutes. He has no business playing a lot with the way hes playing right now
11222,2020-12-31 02:51:09,kmuz8d,I need all my DP stans to get in here
11223,2020-12-30 16:07:27,kmuz8d,"Might we go 19-20...
Luka, THJ, DF-S, Maxi, Powell

Or throw JGreen into the fire...
Luka, THJ, JGreen, DF-S, Powell

?"
11224,2020-12-31 01:34:11,kmuz8d,"Oh my God that is so frustrating to me. We can’t have any luck, fucking *ever.*"
11225,2020-12-31 02:46:48,kmuz8d,I have the same question
11226,2020-12-31 02:46:29,kmuz8d,Yeah he got him on the arm
11227,2020-12-31 02:46:39,kmuz8d,Yeah unfortunately
11228,2020-12-31 02:46:47,kmuz8d,No. It was good defense. Arms were strait up.
11229,2020-12-31 02:48:38,kmuz8d,"Hornets players can hit Luka all they want and no foul, but if he breathes on them you bet the refs will blow the whistle"
11230,2020-12-31 03:48:49,kmuz8d,Usual Hayward
11231,2020-12-31 03:53:39,kmuz8d,Twins
11232,2020-12-30 15:45:19,kmuz8d,He could literally do anything and bleacher report will send me a notification about it
11233,2020-12-31 01:49:03,kmuz8d,Yes he definitely is. This is the driving luka we're used to
11234,2020-12-31 01:50:21,kmuz8d,Loaded up reddit right after I saw the play to check this thread 🤣
11235,2020-12-31 01:51:05,kmuz8d,"It's hilarious, just like anyone biting on that pump fake"
11236,2020-12-31 01:58:55,kmuz8d,He looks worse then last year.
11237,2020-12-31 01:57:22,kmuz8d,I heard it too
11238,2020-12-31 02:59:30,kmuz8d,He loses his cool and is too frustrated to play sometimes.
11239,2020-12-31 03:08:37,kmuz8d,Like 7
11240,2020-12-31 03:19:14,kmuz8d,"yeah good thing is that he hit rock bottom so he can only go up from here, maybe this shows him that for him to make that GOAT potential everyone knows he has he needs to keep in shape all the time and not take anything for granted, still extremely young tho so im not packining"
11241,2020-12-31 03:17:49,kmuz8d,He so far doesn't even look remotely in the MVP discussion
11242,2020-12-31 03:25:02,kmuz8d,"Well we will see how he bounces back. It should just be a shooting slump, he clearly can shoot. We gotta figure out how to get his confidence back. Even the best shooters get into slumps."
11243,2020-12-31 03:29:38,kmuz8d,That's the mark of a mediocre team.
11244,2020-12-31 03:28:30,kmuz8d,Agreed. Just see what happens
11245,2020-12-31 03:33:09,kmuz8d,"It’s not a bad idea, if he’s just in a shooting slump just shooting his way out of it might be the way. Plus let the rookies play, we might need them later on. You never know with covid might end up with rookies having to play bc of positive tests or whatever."
11246,2020-12-31 03:49:23,kmuz8d,THIS!!
11247,2020-12-31 03:47:24,kmuz8d,He slipped a quick “fuckin’” in a sentence.
11248,2020-12-31 03:57:36,kmuz8d,He won't listen
11249,2020-12-31 02:52:38,kmuz8d,Hhahaha
11250,2020-12-31 03:31:07,kmuz8d,Well if this continues with KP too u got ur answer.Fire Rick.
11251,2020-12-31 03:21:35,kmuz8d,"Offense and defense look wonderful until Stotts and Casey leave.
Offense looks wonderful again until Silas leaves.
Brain drain. Rick’s just an old crotchety stubborn ass. Time to move on. Zero playoff series wins in a decade!"
11252,2020-12-31 02:10:07,kmuz8d,He has 2 fouls
11253,2020-12-31 02:11:29,kmuz8d,"Maybe, just maybe, because he had 2 fouls in 2 minutes, y'all gotta chill on the rick blaming, and i dont like powell either"
11254,2020-12-31 02:11:06,kmuz8d,mavs are shooting a higher % from the field what u talking about
11255,2020-12-31 02:23:49,kmuz8d,For real. A really nice surprise.
11256,2020-12-31 02:33:24,kmuz8d,I thought WCS was the answer
11257,2020-12-31 02:39:33,kmuz8d,"Grayson Allen, Powell, then Oubre."
11258,2020-12-31 02:40:03,kmuz8d,I’m a Powell fan as well but this season he has been atrocious no doubt. Maxi has actually played well but getting shit minutes
11259,2020-12-31 02:39:43,kmuz8d,"Bro I get it he sucks. But can we all stop blaming one guy for this game when everybody seem to suck. This is all team effort, not on one guy."
11260,2020-12-31 02:44:24,kmuz8d,I know he's streaky but I really love THJ
11261,2020-12-31 02:49:02,kmuz8d,"I don't know what it is, I feel like teams are just playing much harder this regular season. A lot of blow out type games because some teams not showing up effort wise."
11262,2020-12-31 03:15:33,kmuz8d,"I mean you can be upset if you want, but basketball is my entertainment, I don’t get paid to play and I can’t change anything so I’m just going to take a loss and look forward to our next game. It makes being a fan much easier for me. 

I don’t actually think any of us in here are toxic, just passionate about our favorite team and players. We all just have a different way of looking at it. Personally life sucks enough I don’t need to add a game to make me more upset."
11263,2020-12-31 03:13:00,kmuz8d,"Same shit, different year. Cowboys don't get a pass for being mediocre for 25 years under Jerry Jones, the Mavs shouldn't get a pass either for being mediocre for the past 10 years under Cuban."
11264,2020-12-31 03:19:29,kmuz8d,respect to you for being positive
11265,2020-12-31 03:37:59,kmuz8d,"Clippers in the first half? Lay off the bong man, your memory is fucked 😉"
11266,2020-12-30 06:24:38,kmuz8d,Gotta play 3 quarters to do that. We’re gonna wrap up the win by halftime
11267,2020-12-31 04:04:26,kmuz8d,That added minutes for Powell was for garbage time.
11268,2020-12-31 01:54:47,kmuz8d,In exchange for 3pt shooting.
11269,2020-12-31 01:59:10,kmuz8d,I was looking for our guys but could only find yours. Do you have a link?
11270,2020-12-31 01:59:16,kmuz8d,"followill is legit a GOAT tier commentator. love harp, but just be prepared for some homerisms with him"
11271,2020-12-31 01:59:31,kmuz8d,Same
11272,2020-12-31 02:21:28,kmuz8d,point forward
11273,2020-12-31 02:25:20,kmuz8d,Totally worth Delon Wright and Justin Jackson.
11274,2020-12-31 02:24:57,kmuz8d,"Dawg is good, right?"
11275,2020-12-31 02:30:03,kmuz8d,I swear I read this every time we lose a game. Maybe we just suck at defense.
11276,2020-12-31 02:37:43,kmuz8d,He can't drive all game
11277,2020-12-31 02:37:36,kmuz8d,Teams have developed better defenses to deal with this?
11278,2020-12-31 02:39:38,kmuz8d,"He needs a decent pnr partner. Opponents are just ignorning Powell this year, for good reason."
11279,2020-12-31 02:50:03,kmuz8d,Idk I think it's pretty good
11280,2020-12-31 02:53:28,kmuz8d,They’re hitting quite a few tough ones as well. We have given them some open looks definitely but even contested a lot of their shots are getting a good bounce and hopefully lamelo cools off.
11281,2020-12-31 03:07:27,kmuz8d,What else is new? That's this team's MO starting from 3 years ago.
11282,2020-12-31 03:12:53,kmuz8d,Mavs turned his ass into James Harden lol
11283,2020-12-31 03:22:32,kmuz8d,"Kleber has improved his 3 point shot but not Luka, it makes no sense."
11284,2020-12-31 03:23:32,kmuz8d,"He hasn't taken a normal jump shot in ages it feels like lol. I blame the coaching staff on some of it, like get him some looks man. Get him a fucking playmaker next to him, he's not harden. Shit Harden has had guys like Paul/Westbrick"
11285,2020-12-31 03:43:01,kmuz8d,I miss the years when mavs were the best FT shooting team in the league
11286,2020-12-31 03:40:04,kmuz8d,I blame Dwight Powell for that
11287,2020-12-31 03:47:52,kmuz8d,I don’t remember him saying anything offensive. When did he say it?
11288,2020-12-31 04:02:57,kmuz8d,saddiq lookin nice for pistons too
11289,2020-12-31 04:03:36,kmuz8d,Dude it's BS that he hasn't gotten any burn; he was a nice contributor for Orlando Magic last year on consistent minutes. Missed opportunity thus far but that's Carlisle for you.
11290,2020-12-31 04:04:38,kmuz8d,Carlisle.
11291,2020-12-31 02:51:15,kmuz8d,"Yeah it's so weird because everything that happens on the court seems to bother him so much, but then he comes into the season out of shape. That's more empty petulance than motivated killer, unfortunately."
11292,2020-12-31 02:52:01,kmuz8d,"He has 0 confidence in his shot right now. He's overthinking things, but honestly defense and close outs is the teams problem this game"
11293,2020-12-31 02:51:10,kmuz8d,Mental midget
11294,2020-12-31 02:54:50,kmuz8d,Definitely a bipolar thread.
11295,2020-12-31 02:56:53,kmuz8d,Powells a good person and great for mavs community outreach programs
11296,2020-12-31 03:23:50,kmuz8d,"I'd rather have Trae Young too, over Brunson"
11297,2020-12-31 03:27:34,kmuz8d,People here think they are fixing the team by being obnoxiously toxic lmao
11298,2020-12-31 01:57:43,kmuz8d,Yeah he did I heard it lmao
11299,2020-12-31 02:11:06,kmuz8d,Unless it’s the Clippers
11300,2020-12-31 02:18:17,kmuz8d,Could be worse. Could be losing by 50 at half.
11301,2020-12-31 02:24:40,kmuz8d,He is. I wish we had a younger version of him that could start and play heavy minutes.
11302,2020-12-31 02:32:43,kmuz8d,Stop watching then pls
11303,2020-12-31 02:32:14,kmuz8d,Charlotte not missing is more of the issue.
11304,2020-12-31 02:33:21,kmuz8d,"Be careful you will be considered an ""overreactor"""
11305,2020-12-31 03:13:26,kmuz8d,People been saying this for like 2 years
11306,2020-12-31 03:15:56,kmuz8d,hes already screwing up his efficiency with these bricks
11307,2020-12-31 03:19:50,kmuz8d,"Man, this is some optimism right here."
11308,2020-12-31 03:21:26,kmuz8d,lmao w elosing by 40
11309,2020-12-31 03:26:56,kmuz8d,I've been thinking that this season. Everyone had high expectations for the Cowboys and they came out and shit the bed.
11310,2020-12-31 03:30:51,kmuz8d,[deleted]
11311,2020-12-31 03:08:45,kmuz8d,Exactly
11312,2020-12-31 03:08:17,kmuz8d,Hornets just beat the nets. They aren’t a bad team
11313,2020-12-31 03:34:27,kmuz8d,I agree and all the blowouts in the NBA support this theory. If it was only the mavs itd be really alarming
11314,2020-12-31 02:53:13,kmuz8d,not happening when we played like ass for the first half
11315,2020-12-31 02:58:25,kmuz8d,"People down voting, they must hate facts..."
11316,2020-12-31 03:48:42,kmuz8d,He's gotta finish his ChocoTaco first
11317,2020-12-31 03:49:09,kmuz8d,Avoid injuries
11318,2020-12-31 03:48:28,kmuz8d,He'd probably throw a fit tbh
11319,2020-12-31 01:47:26,kmuz8d,Please!
11320,2020-12-31 02:22:07,kmuz8d,https://www.streameast.live/basketball/charlotte-hornets-dallas-mavericks/
11321,2020-12-31 02:21:41,kmuz8d,We've lost 4 out of the last 5 at home they just said wtf
11322,2020-12-31 02:24:59,kmuz8d,They look so scared when they have to handle the ball.
11323,2020-12-31 02:42:45,kmuz8d,"Unpopular opinion, but I love Skin"
11324,2020-12-31 02:50:18,kmuz8d,Yes blame the arena and not the coach who has been here through all these disappointments.
11325,2020-12-31 02:57:32,kmuz8d,Ngl Biyombo looks pretty solid tonight. Might just be due to the contrast though.
11326,2020-12-31 03:11:42,kmuz8d,It might have something to do with the crowd not being there as well. Harder to come back from down big without that energy
11327,2020-12-31 03:10:50,kmuz8d,Bc the team is collapsing on him and he’s kicking out to open shooters but they’re bricking
11328,2020-12-31 03:11:57,kmuz8d,"Effort is fucking pitiful. Nobody moving their feet, everybody just standing and watching. They are playing like they played last night, not three days ago."
11329,2020-12-31 03:14:04,kmuz8d,This is like a crawl with dragging their guts behind them lol
11330,2020-12-31 03:17:08,kmuz8d,Stop the count!
11331,2020-12-31 03:21:13,kmuz8d,As it should
11332,2020-12-31 03:21:31,kmuz8d,Deservedly so. He's literally forgotten how to shoot the ball.
11333,2020-12-31 03:22:47,kmuz8d,he deserves it
11334,2020-12-31 03:27:26,kmuz8d,"Well he deserves it.His 3pt shot from the rookie season was 100 more times better then rn.Idk how someone can spend 2 years in the NBA,work in the off season on it and be more bad then where he started from.He needs to fire all his training coaches and start with new ones.Same with his nutritionist."
11335,2020-12-31 03:23:28,kmuz8d,"He deserves it. Expectations are high for him, he needs to play up to his ability and is not doing so as of now."
11336,2020-12-31 03:22:04,kmuz8d,But without any athleticism or defence
11337,2020-12-31 03:22:12,kmuz8d,Without the defense.
11338,2020-12-31 03:22:39,kmuz8d,without the defense
11339,2020-12-31 03:21:40,kmuz8d,ben wouldn’t fuk his team over like this
11340,2020-12-31 03:24:34,kmuz8d,"thats not even about being out of shape and his mechanics are the same, its either the biggest shooting slump of all time or the monstars took his jumpshot skills"
11341,2020-12-31 03:26:08,kmuz8d,"He dicked around all offseason playing video games and eating donuts...like all future mvps do, duh"
11342,2020-12-31 03:25:31,kmuz8d,bad
11343,2020-12-31 03:36:46,kmuz8d,Harden gonna miss 80+% of the season for violating covid protocol at the strip club. You got fleeced
11344,2020-12-31 03:25:56,kmuz8d,The offseason was like barely 3 months too
11345,2020-12-31 03:25:55,kmuz8d,How are you a professional athlete and not in shape haha unreal
11346,2020-12-31 02:46:07,kmuz8d,Luka's been underwhelming so far. Guys saying he's playing good just looking at his points per game are surely not watching mavs basketball. It's the very beginning of the season  though and he will probably get in rythm in some weeks
11347,2020-12-31 02:51:11,kmuz8d,"Yeah, no, perhaps if the ez shots he creates for his teammates would go in and not get freaking wedged on the rim, if he had a reliable rolling partner unlike Powell this season, if he wouldn't get called for a bogus offensive foul just after getting slammed on the hands by Ball, you couldn't say that. 

Sure he gained some kilos, he's currently not hitting 3s, but he gets to the paint at will, he concentrates on FTs and he plays solid D."
11348,2020-12-31 02:43:17,kmuz8d,No. It’s 100% Powell’s fault.
11349,2020-12-31 02:44:08,kmuz8d,Tbf none of the 3’s were open Charotte played good D
11350,2020-12-31 02:49:17,kmuz8d,That’s what creates beef between players and coaches.  Rick needs to trust his star when he says I’m good.
11351,2020-12-31 02:47:52,kmuz8d,I guess you loved those bricks at the end of the half with the broken down offense too.
11352,2020-12-30 22:08:52,kmuz8d,"Burke or Maxi. 

But question is who will play with second unit. Green, Iwundu or Terry."
11353,2020-12-31 03:00:56,kmuz8d,What sucks is you know he's trying. He's always hustling but just isn't good enough. I feel for the guy
11354,2020-12-31 03:02:43,kmuz8d,"Was there anyone drafted after Green getting PT/boards? I know Rick hates rookies, but there had to be something that could’ve been more of a complimentary piece."
11355,2020-12-31 03:26:56,kmuz8d,I gotta guess
11356,2020-12-31 03:29:45,kmuz8d,Dallas Sports made a deal with the devil for 2011. It was evident only 4 months later into the year.
11357,2020-12-31 01:41:19,kmuz8d,"The clock and start time references the end of when they can warmup and use the court. Then there is 10 minutes until jump ball to get the court ready, do the anthem and warmups, etc. Think of the start time as the “broadcast time.” It’s just when the broadcast starts and not the tip"
11358,2020-12-31 01:44:42,kmuz8d,It’s to get you to tune in early. Whenever you see a start time add 10-15 minutes. It’s terrible but most people get so used to it. I do feel bad for our Euro bros though
11359,2020-12-31 02:02:10,kmuz8d,He can get the hops back. Just needs to get in better shape
11360,2020-12-31 02:08:41,kmuz8d,Idk maybe because of his 2nd foul
11361,2020-12-31 02:10:49,kmuz8d,early fouls
11362,2020-12-31 02:09:59,kmuz8d,We get it man
11363,2020-12-31 02:32:38,kmuz8d,We are shooting 61% lmao
11364,2020-12-31 02:34:26,kmuz8d,What has Rick with fucking Powell? I can’t believe this.
11365,2020-12-31 02:40:13,kmuz8d,Sweep the leg.
11366,2020-12-31 02:40:32,kmuz8d,"biyombo should have crouched, that's launch punishable"
11367,2020-12-31 02:53:43,kmuz8d,"He said “No!” 

Luka didn’t want to come off the court."
11368,2020-12-31 02:53:46,kmuz8d,Rick subbed him out after his 3rd foul and luka was pleading not to go out
11369,2020-12-31 02:53:45,kmuz8d,He begged not to get taken out
11370,2020-12-31 03:18:44,kmuz8d,He's got 4 points and one rebound lol
11371,2020-12-31 03:22:42,kmuz8d,Was questionable with a quad strain
11372,2020-12-31 03:21:08,kmuz8d,He was questionable to begin with an he landed on a hornets players foot in the first quarter.
11373,2020-12-31 03:21:51,kmuz8d,Talk shit if we look this bad when our highest paid player gets back
11374,2020-12-31 03:28:08,kmuz8d,STOP THE COUNT
11375,2020-12-31 03:29:33,kmuz8d,Sad!
11376,2020-12-31 03:25:24,kmuz8d,"I mean he's visibly fat, this isn't some kind of mystery."
11377,2020-12-31 03:31:01,kmuz8d,why wouldn't he?
11378,2020-12-31 03:54:57,kmuz8d,WCS just looks scary but he's definitely soft
11379,2020-12-31 03:54:58,kmuz8d,WCS is not tough.
11380,2020-12-31 03:44:03,kmuz8d,Ok Willy
11381,2020-12-31 03:22:22,kmuz8d,Love Luka but so far cant argue with it
11382,2020-12-31 03:21:23,kmuz8d,careful... downvotes will income when speaking truth
11383,2020-12-31 02:23:57,kmuz8d,I'm used to the Suns/Knicks doing that but now the Hornets? It's getting real annoying.
11384,2020-12-31 03:07:01,kmuz8d,He’s too small to rebound well
11385,2020-12-31 03:34:15,kmuz8d,"Our mother fucking starting center has 10 rebounds in 4 games, got outrebounded by midgets everyfucking game"
11386,2020-12-31 03:33:01,kmuz8d,"I will blame Powell everytime he is outrebounded by other teams point guards, even bench ones"
11387,2020-12-31 03:31:19,kmuz8d,BUT..BUT..BUT IF WCS STARTED...
11388,2020-12-31 03:29:43,kmuz8d,And Maxi.
11389,2020-12-31 02:43:18,kmuz8d,He really needs to develop a pull up game. Whatever it is he's not getting shots at the rim as much this year.
11390,2020-12-31 02:52:21,kmuz8d,Bruh let luka cook.  He knows what he’s doing.
11391,2020-12-31 03:00:05,kmuz8d,Downvotes incoming in 3...2...1
11392,2020-12-31 01:51:19,kmuz8d,You still need the link?
11393,2020-12-31 01:37:23,kmuz8d,So it’s not just my bootleg? Good to know.
11394,2020-12-31 01:37:37,kmuz8d,Yes! That mean it’s not working?
11395,2020-12-31 01:37:48,kmuz8d,"The bilasports has the FSSW option, doing intros now. Bilasports definitely the best IMO"
11396,2020-12-31 01:57:51,kmuz8d,He's looked very good so far in this short sample size. Good for him though.
11397,2020-12-31 02:04:51,kmuz8d,Yea i watched a couple of hornets games. Theyre great
11398,2020-12-31 02:06:14,kmuz8d,"Yeah, they're pretty awesome"
11399,2020-12-31 02:15:40,kmuz8d,That’s what she said
11400,2020-12-31 02:16:32,kmuz8d,ZzzZzZzzzZzzzZzzz
11401,2020-12-31 02:24:41,kmuz8d,"Rick always puts Luka with like 5 mins left in the 2nd, and plays him the whole third"
11402,2020-12-31 02:24:26,kmuz8d,Refs screwed us so bad with that rubbish no call to offensive foul call
11403,2020-12-31 02:28:25,kmuz8d,Spoke too soon.
11404,2020-12-31 02:36:32,kmuz8d,He is a bad shooter.
11405,2020-12-31 02:36:20,kmuz8d,He's been bad so far this year.
11406,2020-12-31 02:41:37,kmuz8d,KP is a beast but we played well without him in the regular season last year. Seems like more than that honestly. Offense just looks flat outside Luka drives.
11407,2020-12-31 03:06:51,kmuz8d,.105%
11408,2020-12-31 03:06:32,kmuz8d,Around 10%
11409,2020-12-31 03:06:49,kmuz8d,11%
11410,2020-12-31 03:06:18,kmuz8d,Like 0.1
11411,2020-12-31 03:09:27,kmuz8d,Borrego owning Carlisle again in Dallas.
11412,2020-12-31 03:09:47,kmuz8d,"we just play like in the first 2 games.No effort at all.They killing us at rebounds,in the post,at the perimeter and we shooting bricks after bricks."
11413,2020-12-31 03:10:48,kmuz8d,Rick doesn't like him.
11414,2020-12-31 03:15:54,kmuz8d,Came back in bad shape and he's not there mentally.
11415,2020-12-31 03:15:56,kmuz8d,"Comes back to shitty conditioning. So many shots front rimmed, that's because no legs."
11416,2020-12-31 03:24:46,kmuz8d,"Dude, that's who he is as a player and always has been"
11417,2020-12-31 03:39:51,kmuz8d,he’s looked out of shape so far this season imo
11418,2020-12-31 03:40:10,kmuz8d,Shooting under 10% from 3 and looks a step slow
11419,2020-12-31 03:40:48,kmuz8d,"attitude...drops his head, he’s the team leader ffs!"
11420,2020-12-31 03:40:02,kmuz8d,Forgot how to shoot.
11421,2020-12-31 03:43:23,kmuz8d,"Out of shape, looks slower and lacks stamina, however he does all the same things on offense as usual but one or 2 seconds slower and it really break our momentum.
The real problem is his perimetar defense, he is allowing 4-5 3 pointers every game, does not even try to contest."
11422,2020-12-31 03:41:37,kmuz8d,"our best player looks like shit, and most of the supporting cast is following in his foot steps

No effort, no urgency"
11423,2020-12-31 03:42:34,kmuz8d,"Everything. Mainly hustle, coaching and Luka doesn’t seem like he wants to participate if everything isn’t going for him. Shits embarrassing."
11424,2020-12-31 03:41:12,kmuz8d,Whole team looks ass out there
11425,2020-12-31 03:42:17,kmuz8d,"No one can make a shot, including layups and free throws"
11426,2020-12-31 03:46:36,kmuz8d,"""You got to make shots, as a player."""
11427,2020-12-31 03:44:07,kmuz8d,"""A lot of things, for sure"""
11428,2020-12-31 03:45:09,kmuz8d,Bad shooting night mainly
11429,2020-12-31 03:41:58,kmuz8d,Our shooting is non existent in the second half
11430,2020-12-31 03:42:16,kmuz8d,Pretty much everything lol. Just another weird blowout this year
11431,2020-12-31 03:57:06,kmuz8d,Same old story
11432,2020-12-31 03:47:09,kmuz8d,Fudge
11433,2020-12-31 02:56:16,kmuz8d,I'll gladly take Drummond right now
11434,2020-12-31 03:21:43,kmuz8d,"Shooting slumps exist, not everything is one extreme or the other"
11435,2020-12-31 03:55:32,kmuz8d,"Dirty play? You act like we’re playing basketball.


This is MMA now"
11436,2020-12-31 03:57:21,kmuz8d,He got pushed before and I don’t mind having some bite
11437,2020-12-31 00:57:22,kmuz8d,I would also like to know if anyone could dm me. The site I used to use is down
11438,2020-12-31 01:29:04,kmuz8d,same
11439,2020-12-31 01:59:38,kmuz8d,That was a bad shot though
11440,2020-12-31 02:03:35,kmuz8d,"The reality is his step back is the only way he can get a decent 3 off, and that's not even an easy shot. He's never been a pull up guy or shoot off screens, he has a slow release. He's never going to be a high percentage guy unless the Mavs create 3s threes for him, which we don't."
11441,2020-12-31 03:21:07,kmuz8d,Already is
11442,2020-12-31 03:55:19,kmuz8d,Probably one or two due to the head butt
11443,2020-12-31 02:55:44,kmuz8d,"Sir this is a Wendy’s

Edit: but I agree"
11444,2020-12-31 03:00:19,kmuz8d,"Look old man, I don't know this Dork Nowinski. All I know is for the Mavs to win, Carlisle needs to make WCS play 48 minutes and send Dwight Powell to China."
11445,2020-12-31 02:57:39,kmuz8d,"I agree with this obviously, but Powell is straight ass though, he needs to be moved. That is just the truth."
11446,2020-12-31 03:55:16,kmuz8d,...why would you not defend your brother
11447,2020-12-31 03:55:37,kmuz8d,They are both currently in game lol.
11448,2020-12-31 03:59:55,kmuz8d,Get out of here with that. Toxic fans dont help anything
11449,2020-12-31 03:32:13,kmuz8d,"I don't mind losing and having a few bad games, I just wish and those losses we actually show some kind of effort, it ain't no problem losing, but at least try. I would never say Trae over luka tho"
11450,2020-12-31 03:31:14,kmuz8d,"It’s the way this team has lost, zero effort, zero care. There are fundamental problems"
11451,2020-12-31 03:30:46,kmuz8d,"I think the avg. age on this sub is 16, maybe lower"
11452,2020-12-31 03:34:23,kmuz8d,"Trae has been clearly better than Luka this year, that is fucking undeniable"
11453,2020-12-31 03:31:22,kmuz8d,"Nope, you gotta win every game wire to wire or your team is garbage /s"
11454,2020-12-31 02:45:27,kmuz8d,Luka often barks at Rick when he wants to take him out of games bc of fouls. Rick has talked about it previously. Everything is fine with them.
11455,2020-12-31 02:44:38,kmuz8d,I'd be pissed about going out
11456,2020-12-31 01:45:10,kmuz8d,What about CAD?
11457,2020-12-31 02:11:12,kmuz8d,7
11458,2020-12-31 03:12:50,kmuz8d,"Its not about KP,  its about zero effort to play the game. Disgusting"
11459,2020-12-31 04:04:01,kmuz8d,All you gonna see is Powell for 30 mins
11460,2020-12-31 04:04:30,kmuz8d,We need to address this season. I’m not waiting for next season. We wasted so much time already when we had Dirk. It was always next season. Let’s not do that again and address them now
11461,2020-12-31 03:00:22,kmuz8d,Bobi’s ears are wiggling.
11462,2020-12-31 03:03:37,kmuz8d,Great start to this prediction.
11463,2020-12-31 03:24:47,kmuz8d,You're the most optimistic person in the world if you believe in this fucking atrocious team play from today
11464,2020-12-31 03:35:49,kmuz8d,the fact that he is still averaging 27 just shows what he can be when he gets in shape
11465,2020-12-31 03:37:01,kmuz8d,To be fair the athletes in Europe are nothing compared to over here. Luka was in perfect shape in the bubble. Not too big and not too skinny.
11466,2020-12-31 03:44:59,kmuz8d,You cannot compare. No 21 year old looks like his 16 year old version. But no question he came out of shape this season.
11467,2020-12-31 03:59:58,kmuz8d,"Agreed - this is what he looked like the last time he was in peak shape:
[Luka Doncic Highlights Real Madrid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJEvoaKZeks)"
11468,2020-12-31 03:36:22,kmuz8d,why the fuck is this downvoted??
11469,2020-12-31 03:39:06,kmuz8d,"What are you talking about? He was in great shape last season, averaged a 30 point TD in the first month and in the bubble he was the fastest and strongest version of himself.
Right now he plays like in the last couple of months in his rookie season, out of shape, in a shooting slump but more composed and experienced.
He will need at least 2-3 more weeks to get back in the shape he was during the bubble."
11470,2020-12-31 03:34:43,kmuz8d,"Wdym? 
The fact that he's great player and has incredible potential doesn't mean he can't be criticized"
11471,2020-12-31 03:35:43,kmuz8d,"Wtf does that even mean?? Dude is shooting and playing like shit tonight, guess what when Jordan or LeBron do the same those fans criticize their ass. What makes Luka so fucking special? He is better than this, that is why people are pissed."
11472,2020-12-31 03:32:50,kmuz8d,Sooo right!
11473,2020-12-31 01:41:35,kmuz8d,lol
11474,2020-12-31 01:40:18,kmuz8d,Well there is no G-league right now. When it comes back they will likely develop with the Legends
11475,2020-12-31 01:44:20,kmuz8d,"I’m searching for one as well, can you please let me know if you find it?"
11476,2020-12-31 01:50:24,kmuz8d,"Should be the primaries again, so fucking clean."
11477,2020-12-31 01:57:43,kmuz8d,"Meh, its still beginning of the game, let's see what the half of the 2nd quarter looks like"
11478,2020-12-31 02:08:33,kmuz8d,"Idk man I really like them. They’re homers, but they get stoked regardless of which team makes a great play."
11479,2020-12-31 02:14:42,kmuz8d,"sure, but we haven’t lost yet so let’s watch it play out"
11480,2020-12-31 02:14:47,kmuz8d,Calm down man :)
11481,2020-12-31 02:14:47,kmuz8d,He'll figure it out. He's one of the best coaches and it's not close.
11482,2020-12-31 02:25:05,kmuz8d,Early fouls
11483,2020-12-31 02:25:54,kmuz8d,"I won’t complain about another team complaining about fouls until Luka learns to chill honestly lol 

You’re right though, was a good block"
11484,2020-12-31 02:32:26,kmuz8d,lamelo a center confirmed.

11488,2020-12-31 02:45:28,kmuz8d,Wym the hornets are known as unstoppable dynasty bruh
11489,2020-12-31 02:44:46,kmuz8d,"We fucking suck, refs are fucking us, Charlotte cant miss AS usual when we play literally any team, and credit to Charlotte their perimeter D has been good"
11490,2020-12-31 02:46:33,kmuz8d,"He was practically begging for the pass and was wide open and Jrich settled for a tough shot. 

And it happened right after again... :("
11491,2020-12-31 02:57:55,kmuz8d,"it feels like we’ve been using him weird this game, let him chuck this next half and try to get in rhythm"
11492,2020-12-31 03:06:50,kmuz8d,I’m starting to feel like this season is not the season
11493,2020-12-31 03:16:40,kmuz8d,when he drives it in and kicks we miss when he shoots a three he misses lol...just one of those nights dont think its going to get any better
11494,2020-12-31 03:16:46,kmuz8d,We've got 30+ million sitting on the bench
11495,2020-12-31 03:17:21,kmuz8d,"I don't know, Rick has always had good offenses when given the talent. Team just seems too Luka reliant, and frankly he's been ass scoring wise today."
11496,2020-12-31 03:19:02,kmuz8d,"1st made in 3rd. 8 mins into 3rd. After 9 unsuccessful attempts.
..."
11497,2020-12-31 03:43:18,kmuz8d,Considering he is 3/14 I’d say trying to get his shot to fall
11498,2020-12-31 03:54:36,kmuz8d,He shoved him then did a bit of a head bump.
11499,2020-12-31 04:04:44,kmuz8d,Yay Tank for knicks
11500,2020-12-31 04:04:05,kmuz8d,Hahaha sarcasm is funny considering the constant bombardment of “**LUKA MVP!!!**” and “*Mavs title contenders?!?!?!*” comments in this sub for the past month
11501,2020-12-31 03:28:16,kmuz8d,its not being stans its ppl like i saw earlier saying fire rick and trade luka
11502,2020-12-31 03:28:28,kmuz8d,the world would be a better place if everyone smoked a joint or something when pissed off.
11503,2020-12-31 02:26:15,kmuz8d,Sure but no chance Gordon shoots average and the bench shoots 100% at the same time.
11504,2020-12-31 02:23:22,kmuz8d,But he isn’t tho. So why say that?
11505,2020-12-31 02:41:53,kmuz8d,Lmao there are people in here actively calling for injuries 😂
11506,2020-12-31 02:42:48,kmuz8d,Yes. It has. I can’t even tell you bro...
11507,2020-12-31 02:45:22,kmuz8d,Why not? If refs are helping your team just go at the beat player till he inevitably fouls out.
11508,2020-12-31 03:20:03,kmuz8d,we fucking suck and they got our picks
11509,2020-12-31 03:29:53,kmuz8d,[deleted]
11510,2020-12-31 02:07:22,kmuz8d,It seems unbelievable right. It’s almost like maybe you’re just wrong and rick is right.
11511,2020-12-31 03:36:09,kmuz8d,Alright guys let's pack it in. Seasons over.
11512,2020-12-31 03:25:24,kmuz8d,"The team sucks dude, everyone has a right to whine"
11513,2020-12-31 03:26:51,kmuz8d,Did you expect positivity here tonight?
11514,2020-12-31 03:27:10,kmuz8d,"?? We're getting blown out by Charlotte. I'm sorry, but when are people allowed to complain? We had one good game which was arguably Clippers fault"
11515,2020-12-31 03:25:44,kmuz8d,Bye!!!!!!
11516,2020-12-31 03:26:54,kmuz8d,"Luka is playing bad, team sucks. What's there to celebrate exactly?"
11517,2020-12-31 03:25:44,kmuz8d,See you next game...
11518,2020-12-31 03:26:03,kmuz8d,Is there a r/Mavericks app no one told me about?
11519,2020-12-31 03:27:19,kmuz8d,fuck off
11520,2020-12-31 02:32:28,kmuz8d,Exactly. They just put in effort 1 game vs clippers and now we are back to the same shit.
11521,2020-12-31 03:09:43,kmuz8d,he got fat
11522,2020-12-31 03:22:17,kmuz8d,"Lmao, don't think so. The problen is nba force these players to play even though they aren't  keen of starting season early. Its their job so they need to show up"
11523,2020-12-31 03:39:38,kmuz8d,Dude's a diva. This gonna get downvoted but who cares
11524,2020-12-31 03:52:52,kmuz8d,"always has been, sadly. And that's saying something."
11525,2020-12-31 03:11:35,kmuz8d,Lol we have a fringe all star player coming back soon. It’s okay to be upset but relax a little bit. 4 games is like 5% of the season.
11526,2020-12-31 02:46:39,kmuz8d,Yup. OBJ style. Needa chill.
11527,2020-12-31 02:49:10,kmuz8d,It’s that gamer rage
11528,2020-12-31 02:12:22,kmuz8d,His rebounding is pretty fucking bad lol
11529,2020-12-31 02:14:44,kmuz8d,We’ll show potential of being a good team but ultimately fail
11530,2020-12-31 02:33:14,kmuz8d,"Carlisle has always been a poor motivator, IMO. Not everything in coaching but a big part."
11531,2020-12-31 02:35:20,kmuz8d,I think it’s a mental thing. He has always been a streaky shooter and right now I think he doubts himself
11532,2020-12-31 02:38:12,kmuz8d,He’s off the floor baby
11533,2020-12-31 02:40:02,kmuz8d,Lamelo is good lol
11534,2020-12-31 03:10:52,kmuz8d,Came here to post this
11535,2020-12-31 03:14:19,kmuz8d,"Bullshit, defense has been awful. Charlotte doesn't score 88 half way through the 3rd quarter due to lucky bounces."
11536,2020-12-31 03:16:58,kmuz8d,No take backs
11537,2020-12-31 03:22:34,kmuz8d,Well at what point does that stop being luck and just that we're not very good?
11538,2020-12-31 03:22:15,kmuz8d,Because our d is absoulte fucking trash
11539,2020-12-31 03:48:00,kmuz8d,Yeah weren't not keeping them scoreless.
11540,2020-12-31 03:22:53,kmuz8d,Imagine getting downvoted for saying this.
11541,2020-12-31 02:15:49,kmuz8d,"It's just crazy how much minutes he's getting off an Achilles. I thought they were going to be cautious, but I guess that's only for KP lol"
11542,2020-12-31 02:12:19,kmuz8d,"Yep but if this keeps going on then rick has to go. You cant win a chip with powell playing any real minutes and if rick wont change it, change rick, idc"
11543,2020-12-31 02:13:54,kmuz8d,He’s not even in the game. Why are you whining?
11544,2020-12-31 02:49:05,kmuz8d,Whiteside is trash
11545,2020-12-31 02:49:05,kmuz8d,Whiteside is a locker room cancer. Why else would he be taken off the scrap heap?
11546,2020-12-31 02:52:58,kmuz8d,Baynes went to Toronto cuz when ibaka left he’s now guaranteed rotation minutes. WCS resigned as (at that time) a third stringer/situational player
11547,2020-12-31 03:33:19,kmuz8d,"If they were good, he would play them like he did with Brunson."
11548,2020-12-31 03:30:18,kmuz8d,You expect him to just bench him and never play him again?
11549,2020-12-31 03:49:46,kmuz8d,"Lol based on our free agency track record for the past 10 years, we’re not getting anyone"
11550,2020-12-31 03:46:51,kmuz8d,"I was saying this shit last year and these idiots downvoted me to hell. Now look at him, he has been dominating this year so far."
11551,2020-12-31 04:02:19,kmuz8d,Drummond don’t wanna go anywhere is the issue
11552,2020-12-31 02:29:29,kmuz8d,"There bench hasn't missed a shot, it's inexcusable"
11553,2020-12-31 02:53:41,kmuz8d,"really wishing we would have risked it on christian wood - giannis (for which i was on) was such a rare chance, we def could have put in a better run for him"
11554,2020-12-31 02:56:04,kmuz8d,"Their FO did an amazing job. Have a lot of talent without even sacrificing future picks or cap space. Signed some good players this offseason, even though Gallinari was kind of an odd move imo."
11555,2020-12-31 02:55:13,kmuz8d,"youll get downvoted tho, this sub is in denial"
11556,2020-12-31 02:53:30,kmuz8d,"But no here you'll only read that all those guys are overpaid and that we ""dodged bullets""."
11557,2020-12-31 02:38:47,kmuz8d,No
11558,2020-12-31 02:42:54,kmuz8d,Healthy KP with Luka gets us there but only on star power. It's fun to see the team have great chemistry and camaraderie but most of them stink for the most part.
11559,2020-12-31 02:40:48,kmuz8d,4 games in talking about playoffs lol
11560,2020-12-31 03:40:38,kmuz8d,Lol even with this game he’s avg 27-7-7... so terrible

11567,2020-12-31 02:21:34,kmuz8d,Good enough for 30 mill a year I guess
11568,2020-12-31 02:22:37,kmuz8d,"Last season he averaged 18/7/4 on 59.5% true shooting as the 3rd or 4th option at times. He’s good when he’s healthy. I might’ve liked him on the Mavs as our 3rd piece, but not for the price"
11569,2020-12-31 02:36:06,kmuz8d,They literally can't miss and we play like ass.
11570,2020-12-31 02:36:26,kmuz8d,Bad defense. Bad offense. No rebounding. Powell. That's about it.
11571,2020-12-31 02:41:46,kmuz8d,No you don’t
11572,2020-12-31 02:57:37,kmuz8d,One of the early games they commented on his realization of the bad shots he was taking and how he wanted to be a better decision maker. 🤷🏻‍♂️
11573,2020-12-31 02:58:42,kmuz8d,"Probably tryng to play more team ball with less usage since we got a better team now, maybe something to do with Rick, this team works better when Luka has the ball in his hands all the time."
11574,2020-12-31 02:57:53,kmuz8d,He is? I see it with his 3 but he has been cold. When he does shoot it and misses he gets criticized to an oblivion. I guess he's just trying to really efficient but sometimes he needs to step up
11575,2020-12-31 02:57:45,kmuz8d,4 field goal attempts at halftime. He wants to be traded to a team with better fans.
11576,2020-12-31 03:01:02,kmuz8d,It's better just to not watch
11577,2020-12-31 03:04:44,kmuz8d,Bilasports.net gives you the FSSW option
11578,2020-12-31 03:04:50,kmuz8d,Hasnt even made 6 threes all yr lol
11579,2020-12-31 03:08:18,kmuz8d,Yes.  Its really pissing me off.
11580,2020-12-31 03:16:52,kmuz8d,"they’ve made everything, we’ve missed everything

makes > misses"
11581,2020-12-31 03:21:35,kmuz8d,They are hot at the moment
11582,2020-12-31 03:29:49,kmuz8d,"Idk if thats a good idea really.If he will stop shooting 3s then he will lose his confidence and become an Ben Simmons.From what it looks like he already lost some of it.He is scared to shot 3s.Compare his shots from now to the ones in his rookie season.He will do stepbacks with no hesitation,now he does the stepbacks fakes the shot and pass it to somebody else."
11583,2020-12-31 03:42:30,kmuz8d,"You were wrong then, you're wrong now."
11584,2020-12-31 03:35:37,kmuz8d,"The West is TOUGH man. I cannot rule out that possibility. Also, the East got a lot better so less gimme game's on that side too, as we are witnessing tonight vs Charlotte."
11585,2020-12-31 03:33:44,kmuz8d,❤️
11586,2020-12-31 02:13:23,kmuz8d,"i really hope when KP comes back we playing WCS from the bench and not Powell.

Powell is lucky cause he is kinda unknown otherwise nobody would bite on his fake and he will be pretty much useless."
11587,2020-12-31 02:20:27,kmuz8d,He's probably the most nice guy in the history of this league. There's no other possible explanation for him to keep having so many minutes.
11588,2020-12-31 03:26:13,kmuz8d,you are just in denial kiddo
11589,2020-12-31 03:23:02,kmuz8d,"Kp can’t solve the fundamental problems that this team has, we’ll be lucky if he can carry us to the playoffs"
11590,2020-12-31 02:21:20,kmuz8d,Think he was saying Bismack isn’t the guy for that pass lol
11591,2020-12-31 02:20:46,kmuz8d,pass was dope af
11592,2020-12-31 02:25:08,kmuz8d,"That pass was horrible. Terrible location, too. Threw it right between biyombo and the defender. Was lucky the refs missed the call"
11593,2020-12-31 02:25:12,kmuz8d,"He wasn't shitting on LaMelo honestly. He's saying Biz doesn't have good hands to receive the pass, which is kind of consensus. LaMelo's playing well, haven't heard anything negative from our announcers about him.

Although, Skin is a homer."
11594,2020-12-31 02:23:07,kmuz8d,hes so fckn annoying
11595,2020-12-31 02:57:01,kmuz8d,"does a loss fall on lebron when he loses? kevin durant? steph curry? you always look at a teams best player, it’s just human nature"
11596,2020-12-31 02:05:50,kmuz8d,"Rick Carlisle rotations, fam."
11597,2020-12-31 02:20:03,kmuz8d,Cuz it’s an nba game and you don’t lead 100% of the time.
11598,2020-12-31 02:33:09,kmuz8d,"For real, God its so tiresome. Its the same people repeating the same thing every game whether he is in the game or not lmao...."
11599,2020-12-31 02:32:51,kmuz8d,"Please god, do that. 

Leave the people who actually like basketball here to talk about the game and not scapegoat every think on one guy."
11600,2020-12-31 03:08:08,kmuz8d,"if Luka needs the ball 90% of the time to go off, that's an indictment of him. Have to be able to contribute without being the one controlling the action the entire time"
11601,2020-12-31 03:55:22,kmuz8d,Luka heard you saying that his 9.4 rebounding average were from uncontested rebounds and stat-padding. So he didn't rebound tonight just for you!
11602,2020-12-31 03:50:11,kmuz8d,Luka is a guard and Dwight is a fucking center
11603,2020-12-31 03:51:53,kmuz8d,"Imagine yourself being a starting center in the nba, and Jalen Brunson constantly outrebounding you, every fucking game"
11604,2020-12-31 03:58:59,kmuz8d,Luka has been shit as well
11605,2020-12-31 03:51:14,kmuz8d,"Our rebounding is shit in the first 4 games, it is not his job to rebound the ball.
His job was to come ready for the season and lead the offense."
11606,2020-12-31 03:52:22,kmuz8d,So if anything that means Dwight's pathetic rebounding numbers are even more inexcusable since Luka is not getting priority to pull them down.
11607,2020-12-31 03:51:24,kmuz8d,"He is not to blame, but he is still trash af. Create a package with him and hope somebody bites for a competent Big. Drummond, Boucher, etc."
11608,2020-12-31 02:19:09,kmuz8d,Some people might not be live.
11609,2020-12-31 02:17:47,kmuz8d,Lol because they literally don't have anything else to say other than shouting into the echo chamber hoping people will upvote them
11610,2020-12-31 02:43:33,kmuz8d,Welcome to our garbage sub
11611,2020-12-31 02:42:38,kmuz8d,"I'd rather beat the Clips by 1 and win this game. They should not be losing to a team with their best 3 players struggling, it's rediculous."
11612,2020-12-31 03:56:50,kmuz8d,"Should 4 games take you out of contention? Or do you mean based on how you expect the rest of his season to play out? I rmember when people said Lebron shouldnt win the year harden got it when he had a bad stretch of a month or so. I disagreed with that. Lebron had a much worse cast and was so much more valuable to his team. This slow start won't disqualify Luka, he will be fine and we'll get back on track."
11613,2020-12-31 03:23:07,kmuz8d,same
11614,2020-12-31 03:52:11,kmuz8d,We dont have our fucking pick. It's unprotected to the knicks.
11615,2020-12-31 03:50:53,kmuz8d,I'd love to see a local guy on the team
11616,2020-12-31 03:17:27,kmuz8d,Bro luka should have like 15 assists. The threes aren't falling.
11617,2020-12-31 03:17:17,kmuz8d,this is straight up false.
11618,2020-12-31 03:34:25,kmuz8d,He doesn't work in customer service.
11619,2020-12-31 03:28:06,kmuz8d,Lol what a shit take
11620,2020-12-31 03:13:07,kmuz8d,"Nah, curry ain't doing shitty in Philly, J-Rich is a better players we struggling bad"
11621,2020-12-31 02:48:22,kmuz8d,Clippers game was 3 days ago..
11622,2020-12-31 02:49:00,kmuz8d,Disagree
11623,2020-12-31 03:02:19,kmuz8d,When your starting center has 6 fewer boards than the opposing teams backup pg it is fair to scapegoat him
11624,2020-12-31 03:01:10,kmuz8d,Powell sucks get over it
11625,2020-12-31 03:43:31,kmuz8d,Rick is bricking all these open shots.
11626,2020-12-31 03:57:58,kmuz8d,"If he thinks he needs to be a douchebag w/ dirty plays to ""fire up the team"" in a blowout against the freakin' Charlotte Hornets, then yeah he should sit the fuck down. We don't need to encourage that kind of BS."
11627,2020-12-31 04:00:37,kmuz8d,"He's a second round talent for a reason. Don't have high hopes for him, most likely be out of the league soon (statistically speaking)."
11628,2020-12-31 04:00:58,kmuz8d,no hes been ass he needs to spend some time in the G league honestly
11629,2020-12-31 03:10:21,kmuz8d,Trae Young nearly took his team to beat the Nets. Trae Young is currently averaging 16 FTA per game.
11630,2020-12-31 02:32:26,kmuz8d,Certainly not 4 games into a season.
11631,2020-12-31 02:32:04,kmuz8d,After KP is back
11632,2020-12-31 02:32:48,kmuz8d,Fuck this fucking team. Bunch of fucking losers who let winning TWO playoff games go to their heads. KP and Luka gonna fucking carry us tho so it’s all good 🤮
11633,2020-12-31 02:40:56,kmuz8d,Not a mavs fan but this year is his first regression lol
11634,2020-12-31 02:18:55,kmuz8d,Think so
11635,2020-12-31 02:19:17,kmuz8d,Won’t see him anymore today and next games as well. Rick has enough.
11636,2020-12-31 03:39:01,kmuz8d,Trade Luka and KP (0 points and 0 minutes) for Lamelo. Who says no?
11637,2020-12-31 03:21:11,kmuz8d,and if he isnt?
11638,2020-12-31 03:21:28,kmuz8d,"Ah yes, Luka player with a different coach last year, it's not like we had the statistically best offense ever last season aswell"
11639,2020-12-31 03:04:36,kmuz8d,[deleted]
11640,2020-12-31 03:28:32,kmuz8d,Or C Lee for that matter
11641,2020-12-31 02:38:48,kmuz8d,Yes
11642,2020-12-31 02:39:08,kmuz8d,Have you been living under a rock?
11643,2020-12-31 03:28:07,kmuz8d,Wrongest thing ever said on this sub.
11644,2020-12-31 03:02:58,kmuz8d,Feels like they just called game there. Lol but we still do have basically the whole half.
11645,2020-12-31 03:39:26,kmuz8d,Luka hasnt been that great either.
11646,2020-12-31 02:47:36,kmuz8d,Lmao dude it’s a long season.
11647,2020-12-31 02:47:52,kmuz8d,"probably just playing too much teamball, LeBron has the same issues sometimes"
11648,2020-12-31 02:49:38,kmuz8d,"unpopular opinion, he should be chucking threes until he gets out of this slump. we're not going to win many games if Luka isn't attempting threes"
11649,2020-12-31 03:31:06,kmuz8d,And here I am thinking is the lack of hustle and rebounding
11650,2020-12-31 02:39:12,kmuz8d,stop crying
11651,2020-12-31 03:26:10,kmuz8d,It's not like there's 68 games to go or anything.
11652,2020-12-31 03:25:33,kmuz8d,Go suck elfrid Payton’s dick and then sit on it pls
11653,2020-12-31 03:24:30,kmuz8d,"We don’t even have to take it off, we’ll try our best to win and still be terrible, this team sucks"
11654,2020-12-31 02:38:45,kmuz8d,What a sad little person you must be.

11656,2020-12-31 02:51:11,kmuz8d,Lmao dude is 21 jackass
11657,2020-12-31 02:50:52,kmuz8d,wow
11658,2020-12-31 02:51:10,kmuz8d,"He's averaging 27ppg, what else you want him to do? He needs to get better at 3 and FT."
11659,2020-12-31 02:50:58,kmuz8d,peaked in his second season lol relax its just a slump
11660,2020-12-31 02:55:04,kmuz8d,Loñ
11661,2020-12-31 03:07:24,kmuz8d,Dude fuck off.
11662,2020-12-31 02:55:17,kmuz8d,"Scrubs? bro watch some more games.

I said from the beginning that this will be a close game but a lot of casuals said we blowing them like the Clippers.They have a good young team."
11663,2020-12-31 02:50:24,kmuz8d,Kevin durant’s nets just lost to them too lmaooo these games just happen get over itZ
11664,2020-12-31 02:48:35,kmuz8d,He isn't a top 5 player.
11665,2020-12-31 03:22:05,kmuz8d,"Can we ban these ""fans""? Toxic af."
11666,2020-12-31 03:22:50,kmuz8d,"This kind of perspective would make more sense if Luka hadn't come into the season with a literal beer-gut. That's not really a winning mentality from his side either, is it?"
11667,2020-12-31 03:26:10,kmuz8d,Thats the reason that FA don't want to come here. And im a dallas fan. But thats fact.
11668,2020-12-31 03:36:35,kmuz8d,Are your retarded?
11669,2020-12-31 03:06:15,kmuz8d,Sorry let us be thrilled we’re getting blown the fuck out by Charlotte at home. Woohoo go mavs you guys look great
11670,2020-12-31 03:02:45,kmuz8d,Shut up
11671,2020-12-31 03:26:06,kmuz8d,He is what he is-- a streaky shooter who is cold more often times than not.
11672,2020-12-31 03:25:12,kmuz8d,Area man has never seen Trey Burke play.
11673,2020-12-31 02:10:37,kmuz8d,"Someone said ""he was hot.""

Lmao"
11674,2020-12-31 03:10:02,kmuz8d,Jesus Christ calm down lmao
11675,2020-12-31 03:11:33,kmuz8d,Luka's not playing shit now lmao
11676,2020-12-31 02:40:36,kmuz8d,Lmao this is a bad take
11677,2020-12-31 02:41:29,kmuz8d,[deleted]
11678,2020-12-31 02:40:18,kmuz8d,Lmao
11679,2020-12-31 02:42:15,kmuz8d,Idiotic take
11680,2020-12-31 01:33:15,kmuz8d,I like them. I’m an old timer. But I would have preferred the Mavs had changed the floor level graphic screen logos as well. The court and seat covers look great. Don Carter smiling down from Heaven tonight!
11681,2020-12-31 03:04:04,kmuz8d,Build around Iwundu
11682,2020-12-31 02:48:00,kmuz8d,Naw doe doe is so good from the corner. He’ll get it
11683,2020-12-31 02:39:40,kmuz8d,#wrong
11684,2020-12-31 02:40:27,kmuz8d,Everyone should block this guy
11685,2020-12-31 02:41:43,kmuz8d,Imagine being this wrong
11686,2020-12-30 17:32:39,kmuz8d,We all sin
11687,2020-12-31 03:36:35,kmuz8d,Oh I think this is way worse than rookie Luka honestly
11688,2020-12-31 03:49:30,kmuz8d,Yeah. As if this roster was Top 4 seed ready to begin with.
11689,2020-12-31 03:52:03,kmuz8d,I suspect that Luka was banking on the season starting in January and was going to pick it up during the month of December to prepare. I think he’s definitely learned now that he has to stay 100 year around though. I think that’s what Rick means when he said the “maturity” part
11690,2020-12-31 02:44:38,kmuz8d,The way they’re calling fouls he he’d probably draw one more foul before he quarter ends
11691,2020-12-31 03:39:42,kmuz8d,Luka’s mom is super healthy. It’s not her.
11692,2020-12-31 03:37:29,kmuz8d,I’d take his moms hot pocket 👌🏻
11693,2020-12-31 03:15:03,kmuz8d,Doubt it
11694,2020-12-31 03:32:05,kmuz8d,"If I only made 2 threes through 4 games, I'd wait for open shots"
11695,2020-12-31 01:50:00,kmuz8d,Yes sir. I just appreciate DFS's continued improvement ever year. Adds something every year and busted ass. So underrated and underpaid. Should be a $12-15 mil player IMO. Hope they are both Mavs only players for their career.
11696,2020-12-31 02:33:10,kmuz8d,"keep that ad hominem up bro, great argument

dude had an open 2 within the restricted area and couldn't convert."
11697,2020-12-31 03:03:47,kmuz8d,I’m afraid you’re right about that
11698,2020-12-31 03:17:18,kmuz8d,How about... hear me out now... Its neither
11699,2020-12-31 03:47:36,kmuz8d,"Don't blame him, I gave up at half lol"
11700,2020-12-30 16:35:04,kmuz8d,Burke
11701,2020-12-30 15:49:29,kmuz8d,"For real, his box scores have been lackluster, but if he makes one crazy pass everyone loses their shit"
11702,2020-12-31 01:35:01,kmuz8d,Letting BR send u auto notification... I see you like to live dangerously.
11703,2020-12-31 01:49:53,kmuz8d,Watching him move the first 2 games and preseason was hard to watch
11704,2020-12-31 01:51:25,kmuz8d,lmao same
11705,2020-12-31 03:00:47,kmuz8d,Nothing wrong with that.  His emotion is what gets him going.
11706,2020-12-31 03:22:36,kmuz8d,"Forget MVP, he won't win it."
11707,2020-12-31 02:11:18,kmuz8d,"Not like he will play him after lol. And at least use boban then. Or throw kleber/Johnson at 5, anything but that bum at this point."
11708,2020-12-31 02:14:13,kmuz8d,Idk
11709,2020-12-31 02:40:49,kmuz8d,"Not saying it's all on him at all, pretty embarrassing performance all around, but Powell is like a heavy shackle on an a man that's already limping."
11710,2020-12-31 03:40:30,kmuz8d,"it’s different when it’s your team... i only saw mavericks crush in that game, and wasn’t paying attention to them missing"
11711,2020-12-30 14:19:09,kmuz8d,"I think this will be close.Hayward is playing like his old self,Rozier been on fire lately and Devonte and PJ looks promising."
11712,2020-12-30 09:54:47,kmuz8d,I honestly want the game to be something like that. I want to see more minutes from our rookies. I feel a bit left out by the ofher teams hyping up their rooks already lol. I need some dose of that.
11713,2020-12-30 21:20:23,kmuz8d,Way to jinx it asshole lol

good luck and heres to a good game"
11715,2020-12-31 02:01:05,kmuz8d,"Can’t stand harp, really.  He never actually says anything of substance."
11716,2020-12-31 02:27:19,kmuz8d,Absolutely
11717,2020-12-31 02:41:07,kmuz8d,He is feeding them with passes for wide fucking open 3s. Make the fucking shots.
11718,2020-12-31 03:43:32,kmuz8d,I miss Dirk going 24/24.
11719,2020-12-31 03:40:43,kmuz8d,WCS had a donut.
11720,2020-12-31 03:00:44,kmuz8d,Just like Harrison Bar....
11721,2020-12-31 02:36:33,kmuz8d,"Look how they are going for rebounds and we are, what a difference."
11722,2020-12-31 03:19:32,kmuz8d,"Powell was legitimately good last year though, he had a great impact on the offense and was not horrible on defense. He's just not the same player anymore though, post achilies."
11723,2020-12-31 03:33:14,kmuz8d,Defense is ass and the offense couldn't get out of it's own way. Kinda like what I'm watching here.
11724,2020-12-31 03:33:37,kmuz8d,"wow, when you put it that way it changes absolutely nothing!!"
11725,2020-12-31 03:50:33,kmuz8d,LMAO i'm dying
11726,2020-12-31 02:22:58,kmuz8d,Sounds about right. Its like their team is full of DJ Augustins when it comes to playing in Dallas.
11727,2020-12-31 02:24:09,kmuz8d,Yeah they aren’t a very good shooting team but when they go to the AAC they start shooting lights out
11728,2020-12-31 03:13:15,kmuz8d,I didn’t think of that. It must be so odd to play at home to an empty arena.
11729,2020-12-31 03:41:24,kmuz8d,rather have that then leloadmanagement
11730,2020-12-31 03:30:34,kmuz8d,Tf was my man eating 😂
11731,2020-12-31 03:02:09,kmuz8d,"Dude he been that good last year because he could shot from 3 too.Maybe at a not so great percentage but in some games he would be rain from there.Now its all bricks and not even hitting the rim or the backboard sometimes. Its very worrying. Once the league see this they will play Luka different and he will get the Ben and Westbrook treatment.

He been saying for the last 2 years that he is focusing on the 3pt shot and FTs and like i said his 3pt shot looks worse then in his rookie season.He is scared to shot them.In his rookie season he will do a stepback and shot them with no hesitation,now he does the stepback and fakes the shot and then pass it to somebody else."
11732,2020-12-31 02:46:50,kmuz8d,Dude even if he plays with me at the center his 3pt shot shouldnt look so bad.I cringe everytime he takes it. I never thought 3pt would be a problem in Luka career when i sae him in his rookie season but now its definitely gonna be a problem.
11733,2020-12-31 02:54:34,kmuz8d,"If Porzingis comes back and Luka continues shooting close to 30% from 3, what will be the excuse? Luka's 3 point problem is his. Probably mental at this point because he's got good form though"
11734,2020-12-31 02:49:46,kmuz8d,"I’m not talking abt that. I wouldn’t have taken them out. But I’m not a coach with decades of experience and has won a ring before. My point is it’s not a sight I want to see when ANY player barks back at the coach, idc if it’s MJ reincarnated the coach always has authority to make decisions not the player"
11735,2020-12-31 00:30:33,kmuz8d,Green there is no question.
11736,2020-12-31 03:03:12,kmuz8d,Is he hustling? You can get more than 0 rebounds with hustle alone. He just looks lost.
11737,2020-12-31 03:01:57,kmuz8d,I agree to some extent but if he was hustling he'd have at least one board
11738,2020-12-31 03:04:20,kmuz8d,"I honestly have no idea, I really did not pay much attention to this draft. I'm sure there was a piece somewhere though. We did miss some in free agency which was a poor decision."
11739,2020-12-31 01:44:56,kmuz8d,"Ah ok, in Australia they kinda have that it’s just a bit more communicated. Thanks for clearing it up"
11740,2020-12-31 01:46:11,kmuz8d,I’m in Aus so start times are amazing for me normally around 10-11 am
11741,2020-12-31 03:30:39,kmuz8d,On 7 minutes you goober
11742,2020-12-31 03:34:51,kmuz8d,well wcs didnt do shit today its just not our game
11743,2020-12-31 03:38:00,kmuz8d,You gonna blame Powell for Luka only getting 2 boards as well?
11744,2020-12-31 02:54:38,kmuz8d,"He's a superstar, and a top 10 player. I'll give him that any day of the week, and twice on Sunday. But he's young and not immune to bad stretches or criticism. Missed shots I don't care, everyone has that. It's more about his attitude and energy and way he presents himself to me. He needs to be more in control of himself and the game."
11745,2020-12-31 03:02:04,kmuz8d,"Yep. Already got the ""case of the dumb"" response from someone. It's real talk though. Got to fix something now before you get 50-60 games in and it's set in stone."
11746,2020-12-31 01:51:43,kmuz8d,found one! thx tho! go mavs.
11747,2020-12-31 02:28:35,kmuz8d,"I guess cuz he left earlier in the 1st half, it seemed so long haha"
11748,2020-12-31 02:26:07,kmuz8d,And rick should have just used the challenge their imo. Dont let your super star get 2 fouls that fast and let refs control the game like that.
11749,2020-12-31 03:26:48,kmuz8d,"And that's why I hate him, if you can't compete when Powell is starting center you should consider another job"
11750,2020-12-31 03:43:14,kmuz8d,Well I’m not a mavs fan but that doesn’t sound like anything to be too worried about. Shooting slumps happen and we’re in the middle of a pandemic. If luka took quarantine as seriously as he should have then he might have just snacked a lot
11751,2020-12-31 03:53:17,kmuz8d,"Coaching? What could you possibly know about coaching?

You can’t make players not miss open layups, not miss open 3’s, and not miss free throws by coaching."
11752,2020-12-31 02:58:27,kmuz8d,This is why I don’t ever understand the people who say he clogs the lane. So does powell and he’s way less of a rebounding threat.
11753,2020-12-31 03:05:02,kmuz8d,"jesus, i actually lolled"
11754,2020-12-31 03:57:59,kmuz8d,They’re grown ass men
11755,2020-12-31 03:56:34,kmuz8d,"They mistakenly said he came off the bench before, my bad"
11756,2020-12-31 03:37:06,kmuz8d,4 games.
11757,2020-12-31 02:49:59,kmuz8d,nah he is gone after season
11758,2020-12-31 03:43:08,kmuz8d,"And yet he dominated here more than he did in the Euroleague. That's not the point though, the point is just look at the way he moves and jumps in his old highlights compared to the ponderous Luka we've come to know in the NBA. He's talented enough to dominate despite his subpar fitness, but he's never going to reach his full potential so long as he's got the muscle definition of a 40 year old IT worker."
11759,2020-12-31 03:48:07,kmuz8d,"Absolutely, outside of catastrophic career ending injuries, high level athletes develop and physically mature so that their physique at 21 is vastly improved compared to when they're 16. Which is what makes Luka's physical decline all the more inexcusable."
11760,2020-12-31 03:40:01,kmuz8d,Exactly. Its getting exhausting having to explain this all the time
11761,2020-12-31 02:02:11,kmuz8d,Search nbabite
11762,2020-12-31 02:12:39,kmuz8d,"You have our guys who can be homers for the Mavs without disparaging the opposing team. First minute I tuned in and they're already talking shit because they're front-running at the moment. Nah, screw em."
11763,2020-12-31 02:13:16,kmuz8d,They’ve gotten stoked about one side and they’ve been dogging on Luka this whole time.
11764,2020-12-31 02:15:26,kmuz8d,You must be new here. We must overreact! I also put money on the Mavs to cover at -8.
11765,2020-12-31 02:39:08,kmuz8d,Mhm but these are the only ones he rly takes it’s not often he gets to spot up. Run off screens or smthn pls stop iso step back deep 3s cuz he’s not harden its not efficient at all he has bank allowance cuz hes made a couple in the past but it’s his worst shot he luvs taking
11766,2020-12-31 02:50:44,kmuz8d,"yeah him, also the tripping. was clear the okd ref didn't think it was a flagrant and the young guy argued with him about it."
11767,2020-12-31 02:26:54,kmuz8d,That’s fair. Hopefully that’s true.
11768,2020-12-31 02:24:43,kmuz8d,To say we’re lucky we’re this close and we need to tighten it up. I doubt he shoots like that all night.
11769,2020-12-31 03:31:44,kmuz8d,Well he is our Second star? I’m not sure KP can solve all problems but you can’t start figuring out rotations until you get him back. He does plug a few holes though.
11770,2020-12-31 02:08:27,kmuz8d,[deleted]
11771,2020-12-31 03:32:51,kmuz8d,"the team is playing poorly. short-handed clips or not, they still set an all-time nba record for halftime lead three days ago. this game sucks. i bitch, i overreact, etc. this was meant to be a joke as in “i hate it here. alright see you tomorrow”. probably went overboard on the “toxic ass whiners” comment"
11772,2020-12-31 03:10:40,kmuz8d,That's not an excuse. He isn't that fat as he sucks in this game.
11773,2020-12-31 03:26:43,kmuz8d,You don’t think it would be something that would take getting used to? I agree the rushed start to the season is causing some weirdness though. But I’m not sure how the players were supposed to be prepared. You can’t train hard year round without risking injury
11774,2020-12-31 03:41:18,kmuz8d,"It’s true. I have no problem with Luka’s game, only his attitude."
11775,2020-12-31 03:17:18,kmuz8d,"If you think KP is going to fix this, you are wrong. There is no fix for no hustle than just doing it. Mavs are just disinterested, are not working hard at all."
11776,2020-12-31 02:40:44,kmuz8d,He's a garbage shooter and finisher at the rim. We are making him into a sniper
11777,2020-12-31 02:40:45,kmuz8d,C'mon have you seen these shots going in
11778,2020-12-31 03:16:37,kmuz8d,Analyze what you’re seeing. They are taking lots of jumpshots (lowest percentage shot) and draining them. The rotations aren’t crisp rn but on ball defense is decent
11779,2020-12-31 03:19:56,kmuz8d,Lol
11780,2020-12-31 03:28:55,kmuz8d,"This has gotta be luck related, I’ve never seen anything like this in my life. Some kinda curse"
11781,2020-12-31 03:25:11,kmuz8d,facts lol
11782,2020-12-31 02:55:17,kmuz8d,lol he has three times Powell's rebounding rate. He's garbage but at least he wants to play basketball. WCS would rather paint.
11783,2020-12-31 02:53:21,kmuz8d,yeah not sure what the deal is with whiteside but he had a lot of potential
11784,2020-12-31 02:57:09,kmuz8d,Whiteside is also the Kings' third stringer and he's perfectly fine in limited minutes.
11785,2020-12-31 02:30:48,kmuz8d,Unsustainable is the word you should have used.
11786,2020-12-31 02:58:38,kmuz8d,"christian wood is literally ""poor man's giannis"". for the price tag houston payed he would be a VERY good backup big to porzingis"
11787,2020-12-31 03:01:10,kmuz8d,Wood was the one guy I was hoping they’d abandon the Giannas dream for this offseason. And he went for less than I expected. But maybe he showed some things to give him pause when he was here.
11788,2020-12-31 03:43:58,kmuz8d,I swear you people just look at boxscores and don't watch games
11789,2020-12-31 03:45:36,kmuz8d,i don’t fucking care about his box score
11790,2020-12-31 02:16:16,kmuz8d,Thanks!
11791,2020-12-31 02:48:18,kmuz8d,Thanks...That helps.
11792,2020-12-31 02:48:42,kmuz8d,Thank you! Powell again? Sigh!
11793,2020-12-31 03:00:51,kmuz8d,"Well we are looking worse this season, atleast for now. We need some hero ball sometimes lol"
11794,2020-12-31 02:58:52,kmuz8d,"I think he is. Less drives, more kick outs to wide open 3’s."
11795,2020-12-31 03:44:54,kmuz8d,You right. We’ll take Powell’s 3 rebounds a night
11796,2020-12-31 03:59:10,kmuz8d,Because THIS trash product is totally working.
11797,2020-12-31 03:46:20,kmuz8d,"We are facing the reality of this team's skill level.  
We overperformed last season, and then we barely made changes.  
Our only way to make it to the playoffs is to hope that Houston, Pelicans, and Grizzlies would play worse than us... so far, it looked like we can hold on to that hope."
11798,2020-12-31 02:59:11,kmuz8d,"Based.

Everyone calls him a top 5 player and MVP front runner, he should be responsible when his team struggles just like literally every other star is when their team struggles. 

Luka is already babied enough by Rick, we don't need to fans to do it as well."
11799,2020-12-31 02:57:43,kmuz8d,Is just stupid
11800,2020-12-31 02:22:20,kmuz8d,[deleted]
11801,2020-12-31 03:17:03,kmuz8d,"he is that type of player, if u dont see it yet then change team or trade him off imo"
11802,2020-12-31 03:58:25,kmuz8d,Imagine riding one player this damn hard
11803,2020-12-31 03:52:07,kmuz8d,Carlisle puts him at center but he is def not a center.
11804,2020-12-31 03:51:15,kmuz8d,"What part of ""Luka averaged 9.4 rebounds last season"" don't you understand?"
11805,2020-12-31 03:53:20,kmuz8d,How does that excuse an elite rebounding guard getting 2 boards?
11806,2020-12-31 03:52:09,kmuz8d,"wow lol.....This dude is a walking triple double and one of the best rebounders on our team.

All of a sudden, it's not his job to rebound? lol"
11807,2020-12-31 02:26:13,kmuz8d,He hasn’t been in in a while prior to that
11808,2020-12-31 04:00:03,kmuz8d,I didn’t say anything about taking him out of contention or disqualifying him. Just that he shouldn’t be number 1 in Vegas odds right now and imo never should’ve been.
11809,2020-12-31 03:52:07,kmuz8d,We dont have our fucking pick. It's unprotected to the knicks.
11810,2020-12-31 03:30:39,kmuz8d,How so?
11811,2020-12-31 03:29:14,kmuz8d,"Being overweight is not the key to a successful career, neither is whining and complaining when things don’t go his way"
11812,2020-12-31 03:15:18,kmuz8d,"Better defensive player yes. Offensively, Seth is one of the best 3 point shooters in the NBA percentage wise. Teams plan around defending the perimeter when he is on the court. Richardson doesnt give teams that kind of threat.

Seth fits so well around Luka and KP but doesnt necessarily fit around Ben and Joel since Ben isnt exactly the kind of playmaker (and shooting threat) Luka is."
11813,2020-12-31 03:17:17,kmuz8d,I would look up Curry's current stats before making stupid claims that.
11814,2020-12-31 03:18:48,kmuz8d,Currys been awesome in Philly wtf u mean
11815,2020-12-31 02:51:59,kmuz8d,Cool story bro
11816,2020-12-31 04:03:42,kmuz8d,"yeah, we need. we lost in the playoffs to the douchebags with dirty plays to fire up the team."
11817,2020-12-31 03:11:06,kmuz8d,Yeah but Luka is highly unlikely to shoot this badly the rest of the season
11818,2020-12-31 03:16:01,kmuz8d,Last time i checked Trae Young wasnt a mavs player
11819,2020-12-31 03:44:01,kmuz8d,I'm down

11824,2020-12-31 03:10:21,kmuz8d,Oh belive me I will as soon as luka is gone. Actualy cant wait for him to get to a competent francize and I dont have to watch this garbage anymore
11825,2020-12-31 02:49:59,kmuz8d,"Nah, your darling powell is. Pathetic bums stick with pathetic bums sk that fits."
11826,2020-12-31 03:07:33,kmuz8d,Don’t be thrilled but all the whiny bitching is annoying asf
11827,2020-12-31 02:12:25,kmuz8d,Wow. Lol This subs basketball IQ has to be last in the league
11828,2020-12-31 03:12:17,kmuz8d,Lmao this guy is telling people to slit their wrists over a basketball game
11829,2020-12-31 03:12:34,kmuz8d,Luka is the only reason this team has more than 0 nationaly televised games lmfao
11830,2020-12-31 02:41:36,kmuz8d,"Sure. Have fun back in the lottery in 2 years, still beliving that rick is some god tier coach."
11831,2020-12-31 02:45:15,kmuz8d,"As long as Lue dosnt play Powell, wr would at least havr a chance"
11832,2020-12-31 02:48:59,kmuz8d,"Just for the day, I love him"
11833,2020-12-30 18:12:24,kmuz8d,"Sure, but not born a sinner."
11834,2020-12-31 04:01:09,kmuz8d,All part of the learning experience I suppose.
11835,2020-12-31 03:16:01,kmuz8d,Reeeeee
11836,2020-12-31 01:53:26,kmuz8d,Commentators called out Charlotte for that play too right after the break😂
11837,2020-12-31 03:43:21,kmuz8d,"Sucks when the turntables turn 😔

I was angry, now I'm amused by the incredible unlucky shots. Nothing to do but smile and think of the next game when the statistics will kick in and we will make up for this travesty."
11838,2020-12-31 01:32:34,kmuz8d,"Before the Clips game and the Suns’ latest victory I would’ve agreed with you. But after what we did to the Clips, and then seeing the Suns beat the shit out of the Kings, I realized the Suns really are a legit squad, which I had suspected all off-season but had to see them in action first. So now that I realize the Suns are legit, it makes sense that we lost to them. The Lakers are the Lakers. Rigged, ref ball, suffocating D, get every foul call when they’re on offense, and they have shooters. So it makes sense that we lost that game. This game? This Hornets squad? They’re playing okay, so they’ll put up a fight, but Mavs win by 10-15."
11839,2020-12-30 14:23:00,kmuz8d,"The Hornets are a real team this year, outside of Knicks and Pistonts there are no true bottom feeding teams in the east this year, gotta earn each W"
11840,2020-12-31 03:46:21,kmuz8d,And JET going 9/10
11841,2020-12-31 03:42:53,kmuz8d,sarcasm
11842,2020-12-31 03:42:24,kmuz8d,That’s fair
11843,2020-12-31 02:55:34,kmuz8d,I didn't see him barking i saw him protesting tho lol. Cant blame him for wanting to stay in the game tbh but on the whole i agree theres a reason hes the coach.
11844,2020-12-31 03:29:51,kmuz8d,"Turn your tv off then and don't watch. Just because you are a coach doesn't make every decision you make infallible, players are smart enough to have an opinion."
11845,2020-12-31 01:59:55,kmuz8d,"No prob! It’s confusing here, too. The main thing is it’s all for advertising $. They want people to tune in at 7:30 local and be forced to watch 10 minutes of commercials bc they sell those commercial spots for the most money. Then tip starts 10 minutes later, but the broadcast will never tell people bc they wouldn’t tune in early. Money is the reason behind it all tho"
11846,2020-12-31 03:31:52,kmuz8d,"Look at the foul column, goober."
11847,2020-12-31 03:35:50,kmuz8d,"But I know WCS is a shit fucking player and he plays 5 minutes a game, not 30"
11848,2020-12-31 03:43:47,kmuz8d,Do you think is normal that brunson gets more rebounds than Powell even though he is a Hobbit ? Luka having a shit game doesn't exclude Powell being a thrash player
11849,2020-12-31 03:45:30,kmuz8d,"Literally the fucking reason he plays is to set screens and rebound, and what he does ?? Pump fake from the 3pt line and gets outrebounded by every single player in the league, I bet you could get more rebounds just by standing still in the paint"
11850,2020-12-31 02:59:31,kmuz8d,Gtfoh with this  nonsense about attitude and energy lol
11851,2020-12-31 01:53:57,kmuz8d,"Ay shit, that was me, I'm going through everyone haha"
11852,2020-12-31 03:59:57,kmuz8d,He gained all that weight in couple of months though. 19/20 season just ended in what October? That’s gotta be unhealthy and not from snacking within two months. That looks like a lot of protein
11853,2020-12-31 03:56:01,kmuz8d,Played collegiate basketball and currently coaching. Our rotations are bad and we refuse to take players out that show no hustle or life. Missing shots is part of the game but showing no life or hustle is inexcusable.
11854,2020-12-31 02:59:26,kmuz8d,And Drummond actually plays defense
11855,2020-12-31 03:01:03,kmuz8d,Ikr. He gives a dam about grabbing the basketball lmao
11856,2020-12-31 03:02:18,kmuz8d,"But, he can open up the floor with his improved 3pt shooting! /s"
11857,2020-12-31 03:37:48,kmuz8d,> this year
11858,2020-12-31 02:51:33,kmuz8d,Who’s gone?
11859,2020-12-31 03:46:29,kmuz8d,He dominates (more like gets better stats) over here because it's easier to score in the NBA and the Euro league has a more team centric game. Luka's build in Europe is too skinny for the NBA. He wouldn't be quick or strong enough to get to the rim
11860,2020-12-31 02:14:17,kmuz8d,"Yeah you’re right. He was also complaining a whole lot. If I watch a Mavs feed of a Houston game, I’m gonna want them to rag on harden if he’s doing the same."
11861,2020-12-31 02:17:20,kmuz8d,haha! there it is. i think we’ll still cover it
11862,2020-12-31 02:13:03,kmuz8d,You know better than a former nba player who’s been coaching for longer than some of these people disagreeing with him have been alive ? Oh ok
11863,2020-12-31 03:42:17,kmuz8d,It's just the new age of players. We were spoiled with Dirk
11864,2020-12-31 02:42:56,kmuz8d,Garbage shooter that’s 40% from three for the season coming into tonight
11865,2020-12-31 03:47:42,kmuz8d,"Teams don't just luck into shooting 50+%. Yes Charlotte hit some tough shots, but Mavs played without intensity. Lazy close outs, confusion on rotations, no rim protection. They're not just taking lots of jumpshots either, they had multiple wide open dunk/layups in the third. If it helps you to sleep at night to chalk all that up to shot luck, godbless you."
11866,2020-12-31 02:59:30,kmuz8d,"just hear me out... christian wood at the 4, instead of dwight powell"
11867,2020-12-31 03:45:19,kmuz8d,right jesus christ
11868,2020-12-31 04:02:05,kmuz8d,"Yeah, that’s it.  The guys in the game threads don’t watch the games."
11869,2020-12-31 03:58:17,kmuz8d,It’s the Russell Westbrook effect.
11870,2020-12-31 03:00:14,kmuz8d,And those open 3's are misses.
11871,2020-12-31 03:45:38,kmuz8d,"You know you can't just ""get"" players in the middle of the season right?

You have to actually trade for them.

Also Luka averages 7 boards and had 2 tonight. This isn't on DP"
11872,2020-12-31 03:59:41,kmuz8d,More trash doesn't make trash better
11873,2020-12-31 03:05:02,kmuz8d,"I actually highly doubt Rick babies Luka in the locker room or on the court. When has Rick ever been known for that? However, he’s always going to have his star players back in public and that’s the way it should be."
11874,2020-12-31 02:24:31,kmuz8d,You never watched the Nba before huh?
11875,2020-12-31 04:02:46,kmuz8d,Imagine being an idiot to not get sarcasm.
11876,2020-12-31 03:56:05,kmuz8d,"It doesn't, worst game of his career, it's something unusual, unlike someone who does the same every game and we know it's going to be the same every night"
11877,2020-12-31 03:17:58,kmuz8d,"We traded a bench shooter for a good defensive starter, don't know how it's J-Rich fault, and how is Ben Simmons not a playmaker like luka, he literally lives by assists and layups for 4-5 years"
11878,2020-12-31 03:35:11,kmuz8d,Just because you miss Curry it doesn't mean it's J-Rich fault lol
11879,2020-12-31 03:46:48,kmuz8d,Bruh Jrich shot good in 3 games and bad only in this one.You forgot when Curry played great in some games and in others he was cold af?
11880,2020-12-31 03:15:53,kmuz8d,"still playing like shit today, can't deny the truth bro"
11881,2020-12-31 02:45:56,kmuz8d,"Homie look at the roster. It’s Luka and a bunch of mediocre role players that, frankly, have been playing at an elevated level since they went to Dallas. THJ? Horribly inefficient with the Knicks. Trey Burke? Was almost out the league. Maxi? Random dude they picked up from Germany that they developed into a stretch 4. This is a fringe playoff roster without KP. 
Edit: I want to add that I generally agree with your take with Powell. It’s unfortunate but those are the cards we were dealt when he tore his Achilles."

11884,2020-12-31 03:16:05,kmuz8d,well
11885,2020-12-31 01:33:38,kmuz8d,"Lol what? Nah man... it’s so early in the season. There are plenty of bottom feeders in the East, they just haven’t dropped their disguises yet. And ironically you mentioned the Knicks who were impressive as hell last night."
11886,2020-12-31 03:36:01,kmuz8d,We was one of the only dudes contesting shots in the paint
11887,2020-12-31 03:48:39,kmuz8d,for real.We need to trade for a center that can rebound.
11888,2020-12-31 03:46:53,kmuz8d,"That's not an answer to my question. 

Rebounds have been a problem, but Luka averaged 7 last year and has had multiple games this season below his avg.

Is that Powell's fault?"
11889,2020-12-31 02:53:45,kmuz8d,Lukita
11890,2020-12-31 03:57:59,kmuz8d,"Since he's quick enough to get to the rim while somewhat fat, it's reasonable to believe he'll be quick enough to do so after shedding the extra pounds or even better, turning them into muscle. Surely you're not going to tell me that his game would suffer if he went from 6'7 240 skinny fat to 225 lean?"
11891,2020-12-31 02:13:38,kmuz8d,[deleted]
11892,2020-12-31 02:49:13,kmuz8d,on 10 attempts lol. Have you seen his shooting form and NBL splits?
11893,2020-12-31 03:52:11,kmuz8d,"Fuck off. I didn’t say it was good defense. I said it wasn’t that bad, said on ball defense was decent (NOT GOOD) and even mentioned the defensive rotations were bad.  No one anticipated bridges ball and mcdaniels to flame us from 3 either"
11894,2020-12-31 03:03:09,kmuz8d,"Imagine having Wood over Powell + WCS... well, that's life"
11895,2020-12-31 03:48:35,kmuz8d,"Well, Powell averaging 3 boards as a starting center is fucking atrocious, he gets outrebounded by brunson lol"
11896,2020-12-31 03:52:31,kmuz8d,Drummond is a free agent after this year. Our main problem is rebounding
11897,2020-12-31 03:56:55,kmuz8d,"He had only 4 boards against the Lakers as well. 

This is a trend this season."
11898,2020-12-31 03:21:54,kmuz8d,because Luka  is a scoring playmaker while Ben Simmons isnt.
11899,2020-12-31 03:17:11,kmuz8d,Would literaly have 15 assists already if anyone could hit an wide open 3. You cant play like this when they can tripple team.him and teammates brick wide open shots after the pass
11900,2020-12-31 02:47:19,kmuz8d,"Rick, rick, rick, rick, rick. Happy? Only acceptable take on this sub anyway."
11901,2020-12-31 02:51:35,kmuz8d,Sorry but I dont quite understand autism...try english
11902,2020-12-31 03:49:56,kmuz8d,lol
11903,2020-12-31 03:39:45,kmuz8d,....you asked why Rick took him out. 4 fouls in 6ish minutes is why.
11904,2020-12-31 03:54:58,kmuz8d,"This is Luka worst game of his career probably, Dwight does this shit every fucking outing he has 12 rebounds in the year, he averages fucking 3, he doesn't hustle, he doesn't even fucking contest, our paint is a free zone for every single team, he gets outrebounded by every single guard that knows how to run, even in the blowout win he couldn't rebound, we all know Luka is having a shit game, Powell looks like a fucking idiot this season"
11905,2020-12-31 03:55:13,kmuz8d,AND LUKA IS OUR FUCKING GUARD
11906,2020-12-31 02:15:38,kmuz8d,Who is we? Homie. You don’t speak for anybody
11907,2020-12-31 03:15:58,kmuz8d,His NBL stats don’t matter when he is in a good run of form since that first game. And plenty of players have had a good NBA career with bad shooting form.
11908,2020-12-31 03:57:42,kmuz8d,"Whatever dude move the goal posts all you want, this was an atrocious game."
11909,2020-12-31 03:58:07,kmuz8d,"And we are criticizing him every time, why can't we criticize Powell lol?"
11910,2020-12-31 03:27:35,kmuz8d,"I didn't read the ""kind"" part my bad, I'm fucking infuriated today, but Ben is a great playmaker anyway"
11911,2020-12-31 03:56:17,kmuz8d,"Yeah, you're clearly not answering the question either because you can't read very well or you just don't want to admit taht Luka's rebounding woes are more of an issue thatn Dwight's.

Stay mad tho"

11913,2020-12-31 03:59:21,kmuz8d,Where did I say you cant?
11914,2020-12-31 04:00:01,kmuz8d,"I literally agreed it was an issue in every response, but our anchor, our protector of the paint, the guy who is there to contest every missed shot of the other team, never grabs a rebound, averages 3rpg and we can't criticize him ? Should we pet him in the head and say good job, brunson outrebounded you but that's okay, don't hustle either, we don't need it ?"
11915,2020-12-31 02:25:36,kmuz8d,It says youre in the majority of people who don’t know what they’re talking about which is why they’re fans and not working for an nba team
11916,2020-12-31 04:00:34,kmuz8d,"I don't know, maybe every comment criticizing him basically saying it isn't his fault at any point"
11917,2020-12-31 04:00:38,kmuz8d,"> and we can't criticize him ?

Where did I say you can't?"
11918,2020-12-31 04:01:28,kmuz8d,"what ? 

Answer the question man. Where Did i say that?"
11919,2020-12-31 04:03:45,kmuz8d,You know I can say the same when you told me I didn't account Luka right ? You just dodging by making another question and this would continue for more than anyone would like it to last

11931,2020-12-30 03:54:15,kmu7jb,It’s almost like the reason some of us thought they would suck is because their roster is garbage
11932,2020-12-30 03:45:26,kmu7jb,I mean it's not exactly a leap to say that a team with horrendous defense plays better when their best defensive players in Bonga and Avdija play
11933,2020-12-30 03:51:43,kmu7jb,Sure but he still needs to attack more. Play like he did last season and hope that ignites not only his play overall but his teammates as well. Hes been too unselfish imo.

11935,2020-12-30 03:53:30,kmu7jb,"Deni was not their best defender, he was in foul trouble for a reason. Not to mention that he didn't look great offensively either. I think he has potential, but this game he struggled a fair bit."
11936,2020-12-30 03:53:23,kmu7jb,"It’s just a worthless stat with such a sample size. Go back to any other season, check the on/off stats of a random team for the first 4-5 games, then overall. 

I’ll post last year’s for the Bucks after 5 games. Robin Lopez best, Middleton one of the worst. Then overall. Robin worst on the rotation, Middleton one of the best.

I don't think it's a stretch to call him our second best defender behind Bonga at all"
11938,2020-12-30 03:55:45,kmu7jb,He was in foul trouble vs Orlando too
11939,2020-12-30 04:00:10,kmu7jb,Doesn't work for bench players. Westbrook and Deni and Bonga were starters
11940,2020-12-30 04:03:02,kmu7jb,"Yeah, but I think there's a gap between him and Bonga defensively still. The guy above said ""easily their best defender"", which just isn't close to being true."
11941,2020-12-30 04:02:40,kmu7jb,"Middleton hasn’t been a bench player for quite some time. Doesn’t work for single-digit games, that’s for sure."
11942,2020-12-30 04:04:08,kmu7jb,In his defense Bonga only played 16 minutes so I can't blame him for not noticing
11943,2020-12-30 04:16:48,kmu7jb,Having a positive on/off is more meaningful as a starter.
11944,2020-12-30 04:07:55,kmu7jb,"That's fair. I still love that pick though, seems like he's going to fit nicely next Russ and Beal. That begs the question though, will Bertans and Rui be the 4/5 going forward?"
11945,2020-12-30 06:43:49,kmu7jb,"And like I already said, Middleton went from one of the worst in that regard to one of the best. It’s still meaningless."
11946,2020-12-30 04:09:04,kmu7jb,"Probably Rui starting 4 and Bryant still starting at the 5, they like taking Bertans off the bench. I have no idea what the end of game lineup will look like though"

11948,2020-12-30 03:30:04,kmtyz3,That bench is cheeks. We were getting destroyed by the Westbrook/Beal/Bertans lineup when we played them but then their bench just got torched lol

I can envision CMC, Kelce, Jefferson start and I’m loving it."
11952,2020-12-30 03:46:12,kmtwbh,I’ve always been for the draft QB late but after this season with losing Dak it made it apparent that having a good QB helps a lot. It’s gonna tempt me next year so I might take a higher round person unless I feel confident I can get a good one later on
11953,2020-12-30 03:30:50,kmtwbh,"There is no position more advantageous than TE. The chances of you scoring similar with QB, RB, WR, Flex, K, D/St is much more likely than being able to match an elite TEs production. That's why a lot of championship teams have Kelce or Waller on them"
11954,2020-12-30 08:10:43,kmtwbh,"I think the biggest point is you want difference making players, irrespective of position. I think I’m going to go in with the mindset of getting a top player where available - for example, it was better to take Adams/Kelce if you were end of round 1 compared to RBs available - Mixon, Sanders, Jacobs etc 


Stud RB and TE is absolutely the biggest difference maker, however, they are still the most scarce thing in fantasy. I think modified zero-RB was probably the optimal strategy this year if you could’ve gotten a stud RB as your first pick - the best draft would’ve been something like Kamara - Kelce - Ridley - Metcalf - Diggs - Kyler - then fill out RB2 either with early season breakouts/waiver (JRob/Gaskin) or fill in with emerging players like McKissic later on.

It was very possible to fill in RB2 on a weekly basis via staying sharp with waivers. I think you’re always going to be weak somewhere and RB2 is the position I’m most willing to be weak at after this year"
11955,2020-12-30 06:23:08,kmtwbh,"This makes sense in thought but streaming QB sucks. TE steaming does too but if you pick wrong there you miss maybe 10 max points. Qb is over double that. I had Watson in 3 leagues. Allen in 1. Streamer in the last. I went to 4 out of 5 finals. Won 1, lost 2 by less than 10, play week 17 for the other where I’m favored with kamara, Jones, gaskin, and Aj brown. I took last place in the league I streamed. I did have lots of injuries with Thomas, Adams, Carson, mostert, gurley, chark, Sutton as my first picks but I had a stretch of 6 consecutive weeks where my QBs position score a total of 44.8 points. Kirk had a 3 point week Ryan had 6 point week, Kirk again with 6, stafford with 5, and carr with like 1 or something. Allen and Watson never scored less then 44.8 in any 2 combined consecutive weeks in 4 point per passing td. Draft a good QB but I wouldn’t before round 4. Allen and Watson were 6th rounders I think and they played great. Kyler was like a 5th rounder and Rodgers was very very late."
11956,2020-12-30 06:20:40,kmtwbh,I believe this is essentially what the “value above replacement” stat captures. That’s how I do most of my pre-draft rankings.
11957,2020-12-30 15:49:01,kmtwbh,i think it might be a little more helpful to take an average of the top 3 or so at each position. major outliers like Davante and Kelce should be considered but also shouldn't tell the whole story.
11958,2020-12-30 07:54:12,kmtwbh,"RB is a moot point. Everybody knows there are a handful of really good ones, then you’re just rolling the dice as you pick Dobbins and Moss and hope they don’t get hurt. And pass catching backs are always worth a look. 

WR, yep, we know there’s a pile of them. 

TE, couple great, lot of TD dependents 

QB... now here’s where your numbers aren’t proving what you think they prove. Look at that 10 point per game drop off. That’s huge. And there will also be some starts from guys like Stafford and Ryan who had plenty of dud games. You probably lost those weeks. This season was really interesting with a couple young QBs making massive leaps. However, in a league full of 35 year old QBs, there aren’t a lot of surprises out there. Using Lamar as the “rule” and not the exception is bad logic. If you really evaluated his throws last year, he wasn’t spreading the ball well. Defenses figured it out, guard the hashes. You were anticipating 1K/10 rushing when you took him. 1st is also a bit earlier than Pat and Lamar went. 2/3 turn was more common. Despite losing CMC and Kittle, the Mahomes in my league still almost made it. 

Heavy bye weeks are when elite QBs really prove their worth. FF scores drop maybe 20% with a couple byes. That extra 10 points at QB goes farther. Also, if several teams carry a backup QB, streamers can be up shit creek real fast."
11959,2020-12-30 12:48:19,kmtwbh,Can any statistical gurus help me figure out how adding a 3rd WR spot skews this data? Does that automatically make WR more valued over RB since so many more will be taken?
11960,2020-12-30 14:41:02,kmtwbh,"I know TE is highly valued. Guy in my league always takes what will be the best TE early (like 3rd round), and never makes playoffs. Talking Gronk glory years, and now Kelce. I feel like the #1 TE always goes too early and you can still get decent value of the 2nd or 3rd TE a couple rounds later. He always has the TE advantage when you play him but usually you have a more complete team."
11961,2020-12-30 15:40:32,kmtwbh,"I had Waller and Kelce in my two leagues and won.. this was without Barkley in one and CMC in the other

What also really helped me was streaming QBs. Id just pick one of Brady/Herbert and occasionally guys like Fitzpatrick and Hurts throughout the season and it felt like I would get 25 from the position every week without having to draft Mahomes.

All the extra points from picking the right QB/DST/K each week really added up for me, so next time I definitely aint picking anyone of those in the top 100 again"
11962,2020-12-30 16:43:54,kmtwbh,I won my league this year with kelce and Waller in the TE and Flex position. I don’t think that will work every year but it almost guaranteed me winning by a good margin the TE and flex spot every week.
11963,2020-12-30 05:34:34,kmtwbh,"I grabbed Murray in week 7, I grabbed Thomas in round 1 and that hurt a lot."
11964,2020-12-30 14:39:00,kmtwbh,"Common misconception that value from the QB position comes from an astonishing points gap. If Matt Ryan was your starter, you would have been out of the playoffs in week 1, because he scored 7 points. Matt ryan had 3 games under ten points, which almost guarantees you a loss. Josh Allen had 1 game under 15 points, you literally didn’t lose one week this year because of Josh Allen, and that is valuable to a team in contrast to a QB you cannot trust. Certainly don’t chase mahomes in the second, but late QB drafting can leave your team worthless without trades or a breakout from waivers."
11965,2020-12-30 03:41:45,kmtwbh,Sounds like a plan! I had Kelce last year. It was such a luxury to not worry about the TE spot and not waste a roster spot on a backup TE.
11966,2020-12-30 14:24:25,kmtwbh,"Short term that's great but as it's a keeper league I wouldn't sell the farm for Kelce. What he's done this year is incredible, and it's easy to imagine him producing insane numbers again... *however,* he'll be 32 next year..."
11967,2020-12-30 17:41:45,kmtwbh,Shits why I go so RB heavy every year. The drop offs from a top tier to the rb2 is huge
11968,2020-12-30 03:57:04,kmtwbh,"Yeah, a top QB is always nice, but opportunity cost must be factored in. In my league, the managers who drafted Mahomes and Jackson in the first round finished last and next to last.

Personally, I ended up with Herbert. In the future, I’ll only draft one QB and hit the WW if necessary."
11969,2020-12-30 04:59:25,kmtwbh,Targeting dak. Hoping he drops as others go mega early on other qbs.
11970,2020-12-30 12:24:41,kmtwbh,"Depends what one considers as *later*. QB is likely the most advantageous position to wait on a starter. Murray, Watson, Wilson, Dak, Brady were all 7th roundish picks. Rodgers and Allen even later. There's always value at the position and almost always a decent option on waivers, outside of superflex and 2QB leagues."
11971,2020-12-30 03:39:13,kmtwbh,"As someone who got murdered by Waller in Weeks 13 and 15 (so unfair!), I've learned that lesson the hard way. I had drafted Hurst and Fant late. Next year, I'm gunning for an early round TE."
11972,2020-12-30 06:25:13,kmtwbh,If you read the thing then actually Kamara’s advantage was greater than kelce.
11973,2020-12-30 04:03:50,kmtwbh,"I mean OP's own chart disagrees with you pretty strongly. Having the RB1 is always the biggest advantage in FF. And then there's this:

https://twitter.com/FFToday/status/1343977376867348481?s=20"
11974,2020-12-30 03:59:50,kmtwbh,"Hells yeah. Gronk won me 2 championships, Graham won me 1, and Hooper won me 1. The drop-off at the position is ridiculous."
11975,2020-12-30 03:41:28,kmtwbh,"Part of me wonders if this was just recency bias. This was a good year for zero RB and I’m wondering what you’re giving up if you draft a TE in round 1 next year. Not to mention regression that could come from spending your 1st round pick for a TE that just had a record breaking season. And I’m a Chiefs homer so I’m not just hating on Kelce

Edit: I suppose my wording should’ve been it’s been a good year for non first round RBs."
11976,2020-12-30 12:27:43,kmtwbh,"TE is the most obvious but elite RBs are still worth their wait in gold. There was a lot of injury at TE that widened Kecle from the field as well. However, after the stud RBs and super elite WRs, Kelce would be a great pick. Kittle might provide even more value."
11977,2020-12-30 21:22:28,kmtwbh,I won with Mark Andrews. He was really solid. I overdrafted him relative to his value for SURE (mid-3rd round) but the last few weeks he was rock solid for me.
11978,2020-12-31 16:58:34,kmtwbh,"I won one league with Waller, and another with drafting Austin Hooper and playing the TE lottery (Tonyan 2.20 in the last week, but he helped get me there). It’s more who is hot in the playoffs and finding value in the draft. I bet there were many more Waller champions than Kelce. 3-4 rounds later and better in the playoffs."
11979,2020-12-30 11:10:47,kmtwbh,"The problem with going zero or one-RB is that your teams ability to overcome injury or loss at that position significantly decreases. 

For instance, if you went CMC or Saquon this year, you probably felt pretty good about taking late round RB’s to plug in your RB2 spot. I went CMC in my 12 team league and wasn’t lucky enough to hit on any of the great waiver wire RBs. There were a couple weeks where I was starting Boston Scott and Jamaal Williams."
11980,2020-12-30 16:51:36,kmtwbh,"Ive come in 1st or 2nd (once came in 2nd) every year since 2012 in pretty competitive leagues. I'm almost always 5-6 picks in with all RB or one non-RB. This year I drafted:

1. Kamara
2. Chubb
3. Hopkins
4. Gurley
5. Bell
6. Ingram

WR and QB I have never not been able to find someone on waivers. This year was Herbert and I traded Ingram and Brandin Cooks for Tyreek Hill in week 2. TE streaming if you hit enough it ends up being a top 5 TE composite; this year using just Higbee, Henry, and Thomas I got over 200 points from the TE spot.

Clearly I had a lot of injuries from RB. But thats the point. RB always get injured and it creates additional scarcity. So if you hoard them to start, you 1) protect yourself and 2) set yourself up to be able to trade to people who went 0-1 RB who end up having their key RB injured early. Dude who traded me Hill was starting Nyheim Hines as his #1 back after whoever it was got injured. He had to pay up (and Ingram had put up 15 points that week, but I knew from snap counts and watching to dump him ASAP)"
11981,2020-12-30 07:01:04,kmtwbh,I agree. It’s different ways of explaining the same concept.
11982,2020-12-30 08:18:54,kmtwbh,"Well, experienced FF players know about the value of RBs. However, the “zero RB” concept is not going away anytime soon (I certainly don’t mind if those proponents end up in my league!). People want to load up on WRs early, that’s their prerogative. But I think it’s important to look at the numbers and evaluate “zero RB” critically. I look at it as passing wisdom on.

Yes, teams will roster backup QBs, but they also draft backup RBs, WRs, and TEs. I was looking at the starting lineup structure in a vacuum.

And I am certainly not advocating drafting your first QB in the 13th round. Drafting a QB in the 1st or 2nd round is what I am criticizing. Looking back at my league’s draft, Watson and Rodgers went in the 6th, Murray and Allen in the 7th (10 teams). So rounds 6-7 seems to be the sweet spot, not reaching but also snagging a solid QB with league winning potential."
11983,2020-12-30 09:36:56,kmtwbh,"Very interesting yes, however I think there is a somewhat safer bet with quarterback drafting late. The reason is that you can play quarterbacks with positive matchups and you can find them throughout the year on the waiver...other positions are so much scarcer in that regard"
11984,2020-12-30 13:07:25,kmtwbh,Yes
11985,2020-12-30 18:52:54,kmtwbh,"Incidentally, I drafted Ryan in the 10th and eventually picked up Herbert, dissatisfied with Ryan’s duds. So my QB for much of the season was free. I think I was more lucky than good.

I don’t think I will wait that long to draft a QB in future years. In my league, Watson/Rodgers/Murray/Allen went in the 6th and 7th rounds. That seems to be the sweet spot: pick up a solid QB with little risk but not to overpay.

I’m not suggesting being complacent with the QB #10 or QB #12. At that point, a manager should stream and play matchups. I was just suggesting that QB drafting is not as crucial to overall success as RB and TE drafting."
11986,2020-12-30 15:03:56,kmtwbh,My comment lacked context so your response is understandable but CMC is my only keeper as you can only keep 1 player in this league and they are your seudo 1st round pick. Kelce would be my pick in the next round.
11987,2020-12-30 04:48:25,kmtwbh,Yeah for the most part picking a QB late has worked out well. Last year I got Lamar off waivers as he was the top one there once Luck retired on me and then it would have worked well again if Dak stayed healthy. It just is so painful to have a QB get 10-15 while others get 20-30+ that make me want to secure that position.
11988,2020-12-30 09:23:53,kmtwbh,"I like to target my QB in the 6-8 range—try to find someone with the ceiling to be a top-5 QB on the year (Allen was that guy this year, Lamar was that guy for me last year though I knew ADP would let him fall to me in the 11th/12th). Next year I’m looking at Herbert, Hurts or maybe even Burrow (burrow probably as a late round flier)."
11989,2020-12-30 12:39:24,kmtwbh,"Guys with Josh Allen and Mahomes made the final in one of my leagues. They also had Davante and Henry/Monty, respectively."
11990,2020-12-30 16:47:09,kmtwbh,I faced off with a number of mahomes owners in playoffs <shrug>
11991,2020-12-31 15:06:52,kmtwbh,"Yeah, I spent the year streaming very weak QBs in a 14 team league, many teams held 2QB.  I was carried to a championship by a loaded RB group. When covid and injuries hit everyone else I was able to plug in guys like a Rojo/Gaskin and while they were getting 3 points at RB.

Kelce’s production was incredible this year, but this TE gap was very atypical. I hope we see a lot of teams overdraft TE’s next year."
11992,2020-12-30 05:03:51,kmtwbh,Yeah I hope the defense doesn’t improve because this was the perfect set up for him. Tons of targets Amari-CeeDee-Shultz-Gallup(although don’t quote me on this but I think his contract is ending) while having what was a good Zeke. And then the defense was horrendous leading to Dak having to constantly throw especially in the fourth quarter to catch up.
11993,2020-12-30 06:25:56,kmtwbh,Waller was like a 8th round pick in 10 team leagues and 7th in 12. He wasn’t that early of a pick. And if you did this with kittle you got screwed. I drafted Andrews as my only early TE. Then I traded for Andrews after his bad stretch in 2 leagues. It worked out perfectly for what I gave up for him and him coming back online as I expected. I plan on trying that again next year.
11994,2020-12-30 07:48:31,kmtwbh,"I got ruined by Waller Week 15 even with Kelce on my roster. The Waller owner also had Ridley, Woods, Taylor, and Chubb and was somehow the 4 seed. He won the ship.

Meanwhile my 1 seed ended up in 4th after getting Kamara’d in Week 16. From most PF and 11-3 to out of the money. My highest buy in league too 😔"
11995,2020-12-30 04:51:36,kmtwbh,"I've always grabbed a te early (4th or 5th, usually #3 or #4 TE on the board) in my keeper league, and it's almost always burned me via injuries. It was nice with waller to just not worry about it this year even if he had some down weeks."
11996,2020-12-30 07:19:06,kmtwbh,"Slightly skewed as it assumes half of the flexes will be RBs, so it compares 1 to 31 instead of 1 to 25. It doesn’t give the same consideration to TEs, which can also be flexed, and it gives too much credit to later RBs as later WRs tend to perform better than thus be more likely to be flexed."
11997,2020-12-30 06:45:07,kmtwbh,Kamara 6 Tds skews the chart considerably
11998,2020-12-30 07:21:10,kmtwbh,"Zero RB and late QB are all theories, not laws. It’s easy to look at it in hindsight, but Cook and Kamara “carried” teams this year. The fact that CMC and Barkley got hurt is a statistical outlier. The first guy to pass on an RB probably took MT, how’d that work out? 

People like to average QB scores which never tells the whole story. 400 yard, 4 TD games single handedly win weeks. Find a QB who puts up a league high of those on the season, and he’s worth an earlier pick. 

Look at Kyler and Allen. They showed promise and had the rushing. Turns out adding good WRs helps."
11999,2020-12-30 06:31:52,kmtwbh,"This was not a good year for zero rb of the top 7 wr drafted Thomas, Adams, hill, Julio Jones, Hopkins, Golladay, Godwin only Adams and hill really did it for you. Hopkins  too but lots of bad games. Id definitely get a stud in the first always."
12000,2020-12-30 03:55:53,kmtwbh,"For zero RB?  James Robinson and *what*, exactly?"
12001,2020-12-30 04:20:13,kmtwbh,"Recency bias? I had to go back to 2017 to find the TE #13 that scored at least half of what the TE #1 scored (Eric Ebron's 132.4 to Kelce's 233.5).

I think that, with the variety of emphases placed on the TE position by 32 different teams, TE being top-heavy is the trend, not a fluke."
12002,2020-12-30 11:20:36,kmtwbh,"I don’t disagree with the fragility of only having one stud RB. Irrespective of that, the RB dead zone was real this year and it was way bigger than what the preseason expectation was.

There were clearly 14 RBs that I was happy with prior to the season, but the only ones that I was ecstatic to take as a first rounder were CMC, Zeke, Saquon, Kamara, Henry, Cook. Every other player had major question marks, and apart from Aaron Jones, they invariably did not hit.

Even if you can take more than one early RB as an anti-fragility measure, the chances that the RB you took was a difference maker was small

The more I play in 12man PPR leagues, I’m aiming for difference makers. You need to hit picks to win, not just have a solid draft. Even if it is somewhat fragile I still think you want to hit on difference makers. The market inefficiency is that people value early RBs very highly and are willing to paper over cracks in order to get that bellcow RB when they are truly very rare.

In 0.5PPR and definitely standard leagues multiple early RB definitely makes more sense for me

Edit: forgot Saquon"
12003,2020-12-30 17:08:48,kmtwbh,"Yes, if you can grab multiple stud RBs that is obviously the best strategy. I’m not disputing that. But I’d also argue that your trade for Tyreek was very lopsided at the time of the trade and that the value of multiple RBs also varies based on format greatly

I play in a 3WR 2 RBs 2 flex 12 man format full PPR. It does not make sense to draft your draft in my format at all. Ideally you are starting 5 WRs in my format. In the format I played in, I do not believe I could have competed with the best teams playing mediocre dead zone RBs in my flex spots while missing out on stud WRs

In season management definitely matters. At various times in my season I started Jamaal Williams, Boston Scott, Deejay Dallas; Carlos Hyde, Gio Bernard for multiple weeks in the mid season. I also became RB rich by trading for distressed assets in Chubb mid season.

One RB is the ideal strat if your workhorse does not get injured. I would also argue that if you are not in a position to draft a bellcow I would much rather take a stud WR. My team would not have worked if I took Mixon instead of Adams. The end of round 1 RBs were extremely disappointing this season for various reasons. The round 3-6 RBs were almost entirely dead."
12004,2020-12-30 23:28:03,kmtwbh,So you've always made the chip in every single competitive league you've been in since 2012 and you've only come in 2nd once?
12005,2020-12-30 08:32:54,kmtwbh,Underrated ways of analyzing fantasy performance. I like to see these kinds of things. Consistency rating is another favorite.
12006,2020-12-30 09:23:57,kmtwbh,"Define Zero RB. If you’re picking rd 1/2 turn, picking two non RBs isn’t crazy. If you wait until round 5+ for your first RB you’re flirting with disaster. 

But you gotta completely recalculate your QB rounds. Allen and Murray will both be gone by end rd 5. 

I think the pile of old QBs with declining production really changes the dynamics."
12007,2020-12-30 10:07:32,kmtwbh,"If people in your league get “it” then they keep a second QB, and playing the WW gets real tough."
12008,2020-12-30 19:13:48,kmtwbh,"Thanks for the clarification, I agree."
12009,2020-12-30 15:37:19,kmtwbh,"Ahh, 10-4, good luck"
12010,2020-12-30 17:33:01,kmtwbh,"Hurts, especially if they draft some recievers to give him some help, definitely looks like the move"
12011,2020-12-30 06:58:38,kmtwbh,"8th round? That was a steal. In my Beersheets, Waller was the TE #5, behind Kelce, Kittle, Andrews, and Ertz. Projected 6th round. Also, with Kittle, you can’t predict injuries. Next year, I would target one of the top 5 TEs by ADP, rather than drafting my first one late."
12012,2020-12-30 18:10:03,kmtwbh,FF is so brutal.  Sorry man.
12013,2020-12-30 14:18:32,kmtwbh,"His example only had rb/wr flex.

Though his settings aren't even close to standard at all, ppr and 12 man lol

People spending so much on TEs is laughable"
12014,2020-12-30 07:14:20,kmtwbh,"RB would still be the biggest spread and highest % on OP's chart even if you used Dalvin Cook. Feel free to check previous years, too."
12015,2020-12-30 04:00:30,kmtwbh,"Mike Davis, JD McKissic, Nyheim Hines, Gio, Gaskin, Gallman"
12016,2020-12-30 04:11:04,kmtwbh,I guess my wording should’ve been that it was a good year for non first round RBs and the top 12 wasn’t just chalk.
12017,2020-12-30 20:41:59,kmtwbh,I can field this one as I basically went 0 rb but not by choice getting mixon and drake who may as well have just dropped. Ended up winning the ship on the back of a late push to make the playoffs by Gibson rojo and Giovanni Bernard
12018,2020-12-30 04:01:52,kmtwbh,I would say it depends on how you define zero RB. Gibson and Gaskin are two off the top of my head. Mike Davis finished in the top 12 and I’d assume you’d need to be aggressive with waivers for zero RB. JD McKissic finished high in PPR.
12019,2020-12-30 04:23:30,kmtwbh,"Where were the top TEs going as far as ADP that year though? I’m just talking about value as far as using your first round pick on a TE vs. an RB. And I’m not saying my opinion is set in stone, it’s just something that I’ve been thinking about since everyone is talking about the early TE strategy now."
12020,2020-12-30 14:32:17,kmtwbh,"I went saquon and did not have another rb and ended up with Ingram as my rb2. I won the league by waiver, trades, and most importantly - schedule. The person with most points (Kyler, Henry, Jrob, Mont) ended up getting 11th place before the consolation playoffs and I snuck into playoffs with hunt and gaskin as my only viable rbs which I got them through trades. I ended up waivering fournette, Akers, pollard; and Wilson either just before the playoffs or during the playoffs to win the chip. I had three highest scoring games of all year for my team in quarter, semi, and finals."
12021,2020-12-31 14:13:55,kmtwbh,"Yes.  Someone posted the list of top 5 RB performances of all time - I had 3/5, with the other 2 having been before 2012. All 8 to 14 team leagues, relatively competitive. There is rarely a year where someone doesn't want to veto a trade I get a desperate RBless owner to agree to."
12022,2020-12-30 17:07:45,kmtwbh,"Where is this info accessible? This is basically tier based rankings, yes? I tried to employ this strategy based on projected points but honestly that seems irrelevant and fruitless since it's difficult to accurately project points pre season."
12023,2020-12-30 10:12:50,kmtwbh,"Sure, zero RB, to a certain extent, can work. Last year, my two first picks were Hopkins and Kelce. I then pivoted to RBs and I was certainly not doomed, with Chubb and Carson still available. Like everything, it depends.

As a general matter, Zero RB can increase risk because of the scarcity of RBs later on. The margin of error for the RBs you pick up later is much slimmer.

I think Allen and Murray will be too expensive in next year’s draft. I’ll let someone else draft them too early."
12024,2020-12-30 14:47:55,kmtwbh,"Ya this is what is missed by people. You don’t take Murray Rodgers or Allen in the fourth/fifth because of their 40 point weeks, you take them because they never have 6 point weeks. OP points to Matt Ryan, but if you started Matt Ryan you would have been eliminated from the playoffs round 1 because he scored 7 points."
12025,2020-12-30 17:34:17,kmtwbh,"Barring the experts ranking him super high causing an inflated ADP, he could even be available in the 9th/10th and that thought has me very excited."
12026,2020-12-30 12:19:11,kmtwbh,"And when you look at how each of them did:

- Ertz missed substantial time through injury, unfair to judge (though Goedert was finally taking over as TE1 as I predicted preseason)
- Kittle missed substantial time through injury, unfair to judge
- Andrews finished TE6, just 6 points behind TE3
- Waller finished TE2, over 80 points ahead of TE3
- Kelce finished TE1, smashed the TE record

The only early TE that can be really diagnosed as a flop this year was Hooper, who finished TE21, behind Kittle. Even those that reached on Gronk still got a TE1 (TE9 on the year)."
12027,2020-12-30 21:29:07,kmtwbh,"It's really odd. ESPN's draft list had Waller in the 6-8 round range as well and he was drafted in the mid-7th in my league.

Likewise Stefon Diggs was put somewhere in the early-mid 7th by ESPN and SHOCKINGLY he went in the early 8th round in one of my leagues. Really makes my league feel super Taco but honestly ESPN had his ADP so smack dab in the middle rounds."
12028,2020-12-30 16:55:23,kmtwbh,How is it laughable? The player on most championship teams was Kelce so what are you even saying
12029,2020-12-30 20:10:16,kmtwbh,"Kelce was by far my most consistent and valuable player throughout the year to a ship and I took him 1.8 with no regrets, hardly laughable."
12030,2020-12-30 04:03:25,kmtwbh,"None of them were terribly reliable or predictable, though those first 5-6 weeks of Davis were nice."
12031,2020-12-30 04:31:22,kmtwbh,"I was not playing FF in 2017, so I don’t know the ADPs from back then. Also, I’m not saying spend a first-round pick on a TE. Like always, it depends on who else is available at the time. If I have a late first round pick next year, I would consider Kelce, knowing I can pick a RB a few picks after."
12032,2021-01-01 06:12:25,kmtwbh,"Vetoing trades? Oof. Red flag there. Not good.

Though I agree to the stacking RBs strat. I tend to get people to bite on it as well. In my main league I have been in since 2011, I have only fallen out of the top 3 twice. Once I came in 9th - stopped caring so much and worked every Sunday so my love for it faded - and the other time was 4th lol.

My main league has two guys that devolved into tacos and it can be really hard to make trades. They draft fine but as the season goes on it can be hard just to get them to change their damn lineup. I won in 2011, 2013 and finally again here in 2020 (have Kamara, Chubb, J-Rob).

Not a single one of my chip or semifinals losses were lopsided. I have always lost in silly ways or in really shitty upsets. Shocking you have never been snakebitten by fantasy in the playoffs.

How many leagues are you in? That is some ridiculous good luck and/or great trades you are able to pull off. Only trades I managed this year were Matt Ryan to the Falcons fan before the season started and narrowly missing on Josh Allen in that trade... and RoJo for Will Fuller. Can be like pulling teeth!

At this point I kinda end up with just hoarding em. Considering injuries it usually doesn't go too badly."
12033,2020-12-30 17:19:20,kmtwbh,"FantasyPros publishes several different “value based” rankings each year. Value over next available, value over replacement player, etc. 

Consistency ratings vary among a few websites but I like the ones that also account for total points and not *just* consistency. Obviously someone scoring 10 points every week is more valuable than someone scoring 5 points every week."
12034,2020-12-30 16:56:23,kmtwbh,"0 RB is the dumbest strategy anyone can employ, by far. Might as well just draft a kicker in the 1st since its not going to be that impactful to chances of making the playoffs w/ 0RB anyways"
12035,2020-12-30 21:32:30,kmtwbh,"That 10 point per game avg also doesn’t factor in: Herbert probably put up a couple of his big games before he was in a lineup. Somebody prob got several Brees’ eggs before making a switch. And Stafford eggs. The guy who drafted Mahomes got every single one of those points. Teams with less reliable QBs who made switches and streamed probably got total points equal to 15th best QB scoring on the season. 
Did you really keep Brady out there for his 4 total TD game vs Car the week after his egg vs NO? He had a bad game the first time against Car... 

And don’t forget that the top 15 QBs didn’t miss very many games. Injuries aren’t just about finding a replacement, it’s the 1/2 games you get the game they get hurt."
12036,2020-12-30 17:51:54,kmtwbh,"Exactly. My plan for next year is looking like Kelce in Round 1 or Kittle in Round 2, Waller wherever his ADP is (to guarantee for myself I have at least 1 stud tight end) running backs in all other rounds up till Round 6, 7-9 being 2nd year wide recievers (Lamb Jefferson Claypool Higgins etc.), 10 being Hurts, and 11-13 being flier rookies (Jamarr Chase and Najee Harris looking nice to me)"
12037,2020-12-30 17:35:36,kmtwbh,"next year's strategy might include drafting kelce/kittle and waller to make sure you get at least one te1, and if they are both te1s just trade the other"
12038,2020-12-30 21:29:16,kmtwbh,Yeah and Andrews missed a couple of games. He also wasn't as much of a TD whore. All in all he had a good year. Overdrafted by his ADP for sure though no doubt
12039,2020-12-30 04:15:20,kmtwbh,"Mckissic has been the very definition of reliable only one sub 8 point game since the bye. Davis has put up 6-15 points every week.  If you had those two and you got Adams, Kelce, Ridley, Diggs which would be 0 RB you likely spanked everyone you played"
12040,2020-12-30 04:52:14,kmtwbh,"I get what you’re saying. I’m not necessarily against early TE like I said, it would just be painful if we all got burned by it next year. Also it would be interesting to do this same exercise with PPG and then additionally with the #6 scorers in each category for a look at the “average” starting level at each position."
12041,2020-12-30 18:57:16,kmtwbh,"Well, it depends. Literal zero RB, like drafting 3 WRs and a TE before a RB, I would say is a recipe for disaster. Drafting Adams and Kelce and then a RB in the 3rd, that could work out.

My personal rule of thumb for future drafts will be to draft 3 RBs in the first 5 picks, with the other picks for WR and TE."
12042,2020-12-30 04:20:35,kmtwbh,"Since the bye? So if you want to write off the first 8 weeks of the season, sure.  And in the end, what you have is a PPR-only guy who could fill a slot but not win games for you."
12043,2020-12-30 07:03:24,kmtwbh,"See my edit, where I added points per game numbers"
12044,2020-12-30 04:29:35,kmtwbh,"Ok I’ll dig even deeper - how about David Montgomery?  A 5-7th round ADP, he’s been absolutely at least an rb2 all year.  Pair that with JRob and with the aforementioned players and again you steam roll people.  Zero RB was absolutely a viable strategy this year. Then add all those other players like a Mike Davis like a mckissic that will get you those 6-15 points you need out of a rb2 with an absolutely loaded roster everywhere else"
12045,2020-12-31 01:08:50,kmtwbh,I saw a stat on the CBS podcast that makes this whole thing even more interesting. 3 RBs scored more PPR points than Darren Waller this year. Robinson was right behind him though.
12046,2020-12-30 04:41:55,kmtwbh,"I'm going to agree, obviously, that Montgomery had a very strong second half in particular. But part of zero RB is the insistence that early wide receivers are more reliable, and if you started this year with two of (Thomas, Julio, Hopkins, Godwin) it didn't work out for you.  

If you started with two of (Adams, Hill, Kelce), it's a different story. But not clearly a safer path."
12047,2020-12-30 07:23:27,kmtwbh,"So you’re saying if you waited on RBs and picked one of the best RB2s and passed on a dozen other guys, you’re in good shape. The word “hindsight” comes to mind."

I know they did improvements on it when they owned it, but I remember reading something that they never did actual farming and instead worked odd jobs (and ran various cons) to make money. I think it was maybe in the Myth Makers by Nibley?

Edit: This apologist article talks about the farm, but still never says what they were actually farming (besides tapping maple trees and planting an orchard)

John Welch started Book of Mormon Central.  He came up with the idea that Chaismus was in the Book of Mormon.

Seems like it could be a problem. For instance Lamar Jackson didn't run but would have had a much better score and I imagine some guys would be the opposite"
12055,2020-12-30 18:02:01,kms25r,"This is awesome, I’m excited to see the version for this years QBs after the combine"
12056,2021-01-02 08:34:50,kms25r,"This is cool! Might I suggest an improvement or two to the variables?

- Replace yards with average air yards per attempt
- Replace games with DP (downs played)
- cut out some of the combine measurables, like shuttle, cone, vertical and broad jump. Those just  are not important compared to hand size or height for a QB. Also that way you can avoid some of the need to assign mean values to those with unavailable data
- generally just reduce the number of variables to just the ones with reasonable importance. 
- use metrics that PFF uses in evaluation as those are clearly far more indicative of an individual’s performance than traditional counting stats"
12057,2020-12-30 08:01:01,kms25r,One of these things is not like the other.
12058,2020-12-30 13:32:22,kms25r,"Yea, I think it's very interesting to look at the top group and their comps all being similar, and then seeing Herbert's comps (all Rd 1 QBs) kind of solidifies how difficult his evaluation was last year."
12059,2020-12-30 13:24:37,kms25r,"I'm aware of this, but I wouldn't consider it a problem.  Combine data for QBs is sparse, regardless, but I wanted to ensure the inclusion of Height/Weight data at a minimum.  I may drop the other testing b/c I do think that the dual-threat ability can be captured w/ the rushing statistics incorporated into the evaluation.

I'll look at the comps for Lamar this afternoon to see if they are more of the dual-threat variety."
12060,2021-01-02 16:47:43,kms25r,"Thanks, and always up for suggestions! I’ll start w the easiest, do you know if that information is publicly available? All my data is from football-reference. I’d like to use Air Yards and others,  but feel the data is limited for collegiate sports. 

I also used their combine data, I keep my own spreadsheet for the combine, but didn’t include arm/hand size back when I started it and that appears to be scarce online, as well. 

If you have publicly available sources, I’d love to dig a bit deeper and even reduce variables, as you say."
12061,2020-12-30 15:29:03,kms25r,Generally when people don’t participate in an event it’s that they think they may do badly. Lamar is an exception. But either way I don’t think they’d be around average.
12062,2021-01-02 19:44:17,kms25r,"Oh shucks, I just realized that PFF only publicizes the indexed database of “advanced” stats through their premium service. Sorry about that. But there’s other little things that could make your equation a little more useful like applying more weight to their most recent stats, and just throwing away all but the 40 yard dash/height/hand size from the Draft combine.

Thanks for putting in the effort to do something cool like this, I can appreciate an amateur analyst haha"
12063,2020-12-30 15:43:52,kms25r,"Overall, I agree.  I think the opt-out ratio for QBs (for all testing) is significantly higher.  That being said, I want to see which comps come back for a few of the dual threat QBs and we can decide if it's even worth it to include combine data. 

The combine data and missing values will be more important for skill positions moving forward w/ this exercise.  I could look at KNN in those cases as opposed to K-means."
12064,2020-12-30 20:23:03,kms25r,"Alright, u/ZandrickEllison let's see the Lamar comps:

Player|	Lamar Sim Score	|Rush Yards	|Rush TD	|Forty
:--: | :--: | :--: |:--: |:--: |
Lamar Jackson |	1.000	| 3172	| 39| 	4.811*
Jordan Lynch |	0.872	| 3735	| 42	| 4.76
Dak Prescott |	0.786| 	1574| 	24| 	4.79
Quinton Flowers	| 0.786| 	2608	| 29	| 4.63
Trevone Boykin	| 0.777| 	1319	| 17	| 4.77
Johnny Manziel	| 0.745| 	2169| 	30	| 4.68
Collin Klein	| 0.732| 	2061	| 50	| 4.78
Chandler Harnish	| 0.717| 	2215| 	18| 	4.68
J.T. Barrett	| 0.715| 	1643	| 21| 	4.70
Deshaun Watson	| 0.685	| 1734| 	21| 	4.66

Tajh Boyd	| 0.599	| 914	| 20	| 4.84
Joshua Dobbs	| 0.570	| 1502	| 23	| 4.64
Patrick Mahomes	| 0.515| 	741| 	22	| 4.80


I don't necessarily think that Rush Yards or Rush TDs are the reason for the comps, but I think that they are all weighted evenly, and the similarity score will pull out dual threat QBs.  If his Forty is truly, say, 4.4 then I would expect similar results w/ lower similarity scores."

12069,2020-12-30 01:52:10,kmr32a,"It’ll probably be a hyper athlete that has access to film at an early age and a mentor that can help them get deep into breaking down film. 

I know people think of nutrition and physical training improving in the future but I think the next big step for future nba players is learning the “chess” aspect of the NBA. How to get deep into film, dissect not only your own game but that of those around you etc. I really don’t think most NBA players learn how to get deep into film sessions until late in their careers unless those players are surrounded by great vets for years. 

Part of what makes a player like Rondo and LeBron able to “coast” throughout a season is because guys like that can already do what is required of them to be successful on the court and what’s left for them year to year is breaking down film. I mean that’s what the playoffs are all about. Sure they spend off seasons refining some on the court skills but I imagine at later stages in their career they focus on their health and just getting to the playoffs."
12070,2020-12-30 00:52:24,kmr32a,"What makes LeBron particularly unique is that, at any moment on the court, he is probably both the most athletic guy and also the smartest guy. That is just rare; usually the most cerebral guy in any sport isn’t *also* their sport’s best athlete. LeBron is. 

And he’s had to do so much to get into the GOAT argument. It’s a dozen and a half seasons of dominance, and counting. 

It’s going to take a hell of a lot. Takes a lot for someone to even sniff the all-time top 5."
12071,2020-12-30 01:38:07,kmr32a,"It sounds trite, but usually there are generational athletes every generation. Have to have mix of physical gifts, work ethic, proper professional situations, avoid injuries, etc. There won't be another quite like Lebron, but there will almost certainly be someone who ends up standing head and shoulders above their peers. We should try to enjoy them while they play, sometimes people spend so much time hating it blinds them to the greatness (happened with Jordan, Kobe, Bron, etc)."
12072,2020-12-30 01:12:39,kmr32a,LeBron ever put up 37 in Game 6 of the ECF against the Celtics? No he hasn’t and that’s why Herro will be better
12073,2020-12-30 00:54:12,kmr32a,"I don't think it's unfathomable. Probably a big player with the speed and skills of a smaller player, something like a Giannis/KD hybrid. 

Hell, Giannis with pretty good shooting is probably GOAT competitive. It's not that hard to imagine."

12080,2020-12-30 03:00:24,kmr32a,"Any discussion about the greatest of all-time in any sport just reminds me of how truly great Wayne Gretzky was. I've never seen a major sport in which a player was so head-and-shoulders ahead of everyone else.

My dad said in the 80's when they used to play fantasy hockey the league would either exclude Gretzky entirely, or have one ""player"" that was Gretzky's goals, and one ""player"" that was Gretzky's assists.

Can you imagine the basketball equivalent of that?! It would be absolutely insane. LeBron definitely has a case as the greatest ever, but he's never been more than like 10% better than the next best player in the league."

12095,2020-12-30 03:12:17,kmr32a,"Here's the fun thing about GOATness:

It doesn't respect age necessarily.

Kareem stepped onto the NBA court as the best player in the league.  He would have been the best player in the league if he had skipped college entirely. The only guy who could touch him was Wilt, but Wilt wasn't much of a winner.

MJ was almost universally accepted as GOAT after his 2nd championship and he never lost the title.

Best offensive player in league history. Best defensive player at his position ever. Doesn't necessarily have to go undefeated in finals series, but better be the MVP every time they win.

That's the bar.  The only way to reach higher than that is to be what he was, but win more titles, and sooner. Basically, it'd have to be someone who would go to a team with a solid roster due to some trade fluke like an unprotected pick and elevate them to titles almost immediately.

To illustrate my point: right now most folks would pick Brady as the GOAT QB in the NFL.  Should Pat Mahomes play his next 5-6 years like he's played his last 3, and win 3-4 more titles during that span, Brady will be getting inducted to the Pro Football HOF as the former GOAT. Greatness and immediate success > lesser output and longer term success."
12096,2020-12-30 02:14:35,kmr32a,"It's an interesting conversation. Luka seems like an evolution of both Lebron and Harden in many ways. It will be interesting and exciting to see how his career plays out. 

There are also guys like Jokic who aren't elite athletes, but are just so uniquely talented that they break the game of basketball and shape it into something that better suits them. Jokic plays even better in the playoffs because the game slows down and a half court offense lets him just plant his 7 foot frame in the paint and feed teammates.

There is also the rings argument. Lebron has many rings, but he has been flat outplayed many times in the finals as well. Jordan never was. And there may be other future athletes that don't have the physical gifts that Lebron does, but have an even stronger winner's mindset.

One thing I think many casual fans kinda right is that as much of a boss Lebron is, he does have his moments of mental weakness that Kobe and Jordan never really showed. 

I just don't think that there's only one way to win."
12097,2020-12-30 02:16:21,kmr32a,"As someone that team hops and absolutely needs 2 imported superstars per team to win a trophy, I’d have to say that as soon as someone can stay put and win titles with drafted teammates and role players, like GS did pre KD. “Adonal Foyle is not walking through that door!” Kidding lol. 

I say that as somebody that absolutely loves LBJs game. That doesn’t make him the GOAT lol. He’s a generational player, a legendary player, and definitely top 3 of all time, but if someone comes along and wins without pulling half the leagues allstars to his teams to win, is when we will have that “better” debate. 

I understand that’s the nature of today’s NBA, so I can’t 100% fault him for it, but you can’t call someone a GOAT when they need other top 5 superstars to and team go and in a league that doesn’t encourage any type of perimeter defense. 

I mean, I love Harden, even as mercurial as he is, but if he goes to Brooklyn or any other “super team”, I’ll say the same shit. That’s what was great about Golden State, they built that squad through the draft, but imported KD and blew the league away. They took a hit, as did KD, when he signed. They became the villains of the NBA for a minute. 

Cheesy and cheap, but hey, that’s today’s NBA.

Edit: All you EA and NBA2K fan kids don’t need to reply. I get why y’all love him, he’s your Jordan and he’s fun to play with on PS4. 

I’m not knocking you for it."
12098,2020-12-30 03:57:13,kmr32a,"I’ve always thought of this. I’m still convinced this player isn’t in the league yet, or they just aren’t good enough for us to realize it."

12102,2020-12-30 07:26:09,kmr32a,Great post. I think the only way you could really say someone is better than Lebron is if there was an even taller Lebron. Like a giannis with great court vision and passing ability
12103,2020-12-30 07:40:16,kmr32a,"I disagree with your premise. Basketball greatness isn't defined as some mix of physical/mental traits. People like to argue things like ""Player X is better because he's 10% better at shooting while being 2% better at passing and only 4% worse at defense. Add those up and he's 8% better"". But the reality is that basketball doesn't work like that. 

LeBron isn't great because he's hyperathletic, or hyperathletic and smart at the same time. He's great because he wins basketball games against the other players of his era.

It's entirely possible that Giannis figures out how to win and has a Jordan-esque run. Or Luka. Or Zion. Or another player. 

It's hard to know, but the next player that will win 4+ championships and 3+ FMVPs is almost certainly already in the league."
12104,2020-12-30 14:45:00,kmr32a,"Yeah, that actually makes sense. Players like steph, shaq, mj are the best at something (shooting, rim dominance, winning). 
Lebron is great at everything, but not the best at any one thing. He's like the most versatile player."
12105,2020-12-30 15:17:14,kmr32a,Kanye West is a musical genius? Eh..
12106,2020-12-30 15:59:44,kmr32a,"Easy (not really). Someone that is 95% as good as LeBron but gets drafted into a Spurs type organization rather than Cleveland. Like say KD if they hadn't have traded Harden to avoid the luxury tax. KD isn't quite as good as Bron, but say he goes 5-0 with the Thunder we probably see them as the same right?

KD and Giannis are the best mold of players in terms of size and athleticism. Giannis doesn't have the shot and KD just hasn't quite had the right luck and teams to amass the stats he would need to be a challenger, but I think the next possible contender to that status fits that mold."
12107,2020-12-31 01:25:54,kmr32a,"Healthy zion Williams?

So realistically, we could have someone equally as good as Lebron but started off with a good team (so more rings) and he would be considered the GOAT"
12111,2020-12-30 00:48:33,kmr32a,Lebron is not better than MJ.  Basketball is a game of skill not just physicality.  Mj was the more complete basketball player whereas LBJ was more complete as an athlete.

12114,2020-12-30 01:09:41,kmr32a,Well there needs to be someone better than current LeBron first.
12115,2020-12-30 04:05:25,kmr32a,"> Like what would a better version of LeBron even be?

IMO the most physically gifted player I've ever seen in the NBA was Shaq. I think Shaq would have unquestionably been considered the GOAT if he had the same drive that guys like Jordan and LeBron have. Jordan was nearly psychotic about what he would do to win, and LeBron puts every ounce he can into maximizing what he can do (i.e. hyperbaric chambers, cryogenics, spending over $1 million a year on his body, etc). Shaq rarely took very good care of himself and would often show up to camp out of shape and just use the season to work himself into shape.

I've always been convinced that when you're as physically gifted as Shaq, to where in college he was getting quadruple teamed and it didn't matter, and in the pros nobody could stop him either, it was probably hard to have it inside himself to push himself to his limit. Why bother when he'd almost surely been able to utterly dominate everyone forever? A big part of what made Michael Jordan who he was was probably him being cut from the team in HS cause he wasn't good enough. I doubt Shaq ever had anything like that happen to him.

Shaq was a fairly lazy player throughout his career, but even still he's a top 10-15 player all time. As good as he was he really only deserved 1 or maybe 2 MVP awards and he never led the league in either rebounding or blocks (while guys like Chris Webber an Shawn Bradley did). So my answer for what a ""better version of LeBron"" would look like is if we get someone else with a physique and athleticism like Shaq but with more motivation and drive and work ethic like Jordan or LeBron."
12116,2020-12-30 00:53:40,kmr32a,"I honestly don’t get the whole mentality thing. The guy has more buzzer playoff game winners than Jordan, kobe, Durant and Curry COMBINED"
12117,2020-12-30 02:27:49,kmr32a,"Her plays in a no contact league catered to his success. Don’t get me wrong, he’s a great player, but he couldn’t handle the physicality so it’s progressively gotten softer throughout his career. He’s not close to peak Mike."

I don’t know why OP assumes that something has to be categorically different about a new player for them to be better than LeBron. Luka’s stats in his first two years have been very similar to LeBron’s first two years. If that continues and Luka has a very similar career trajectory to LeBron, but he happens to have a better team around him and wins 2 more rings or something, would that be enough? If Luka matches MVPs of LeBron but goes 7-2 in the finals, or something similar, I think that’s put him in GOAT contention even if he’s not “better” at any individual part of the game. 

I guess I’m just saying that basketball is a team sport, so someone on a similar level to LeBron (still a once in a generation talent) could look a lot better in the GOAT debate if they happen to have a better team built around them"

Him being that way, the physical freak of nature he is, doesn't require him to be that relentless assassin that would strike over and over again. He isn't as lazy as what us normal average people think. The lazy standard between us and a professional basketball superstar is different. He still works hard for sure because he wouldn't have the skills he possesses if he didn't. It's just that he did have that ""extra"" drive to be able to overcome history. To be able to compete with history itself. And if ever he has that, who knows if his body can take that ""extra"" toll as well.

12156,2020-12-30 02:22:06,kmr32a,What an absolute shit take.
12157,2020-12-31 02:13:27,kmr32a,Steph? Nah fam.
12158,2020-12-30 04:08:38,kmr32a,"How do you feel about Derrick Henry? For as big & strong as he is, seeing him leave safeties in the dust (if he isn't throwing them down in it) is mind boggling. I feel like he's an athlete whose talents & ability we won't see again for some time."
12159,2020-12-30 04:30:53,kmr32a,"Rookie year Saquon is the greatest shit I've ever seen on the football field. Ever. Man was weaving in, out, around, and over defenders while surrounded.

And coaching, scheming, blocking, nothing had anything to do with it. It was all Saquon and his massive thighs."
12160,2020-12-30 08:18:41,kmr32a,"I forgot where I heard this recently, but someone recently mentioned how old school coaching staffs differed from today’s and the biggest difference being that today’s coaching staffs are much much larger because of the amount of film that is compiled before games for head coaches and players to review. If this is relatively new in the professional coaching world, could you imagine what players in the future will be like if they have these types of resources before they even reach NBA or even college? 

It’s fascinating to imagine what the league would look like if an entire generation of players one day become cerebral players."
12161,2020-12-30 09:13:14,kmr32a,"Jokic and Rondo are not on par with the Basketball IQ of Lebron. I think Rondo is closer, but Jokic, as amazing as he is at his age, is not near Lebron levels of Basketball IQ."
12162,2020-12-30 02:05:35,kmr32a,45 isn’t 37
12163,2020-12-30 02:53:16,kmr32a,That’d do it.
12164,2021-01-01 00:18:52,kmr32a,"He'd be close to Lebron currently with average shooting, but Peak Lebron would still be in a tier of his own compared to current players + supergiannis"
12165,2020-12-30 01:05:46,kmr32a,Boban.
12166,2020-12-30 01:15:40,kmr32a,Good point
12167,2020-12-30 17:34:52,kmr32a,"He didn’t say that lebron was the sure fire goat. He said he thinks he is. Either way, lebron is first or second and that doesn’t take away from the point of the post."
12168,2020-12-30 09:42:37,kmr32a,Kobe was closer in age to LeBron than he was to Shaq. What we define as a generation is pretty arbitrary.
12169,2020-12-31 21:35:16,kmr32a,Lol this. He’s got really high IQ. I’d say if he was as good at passing and facilitating he’d have a pretty strong case for it
12170,2020-12-30 06:23:12,kmr32a,Lol no
12171,2020-12-30 20:34:28,kmr32a,Luka hasn’t shown close to enough on defense to look like someone who will eventually be in the GOAT conversation. Amazing player but he needs to develop on that side of the ball a lot to be on that level.
12172,2020-12-30 00:55:52,kmr32a,Y’all really never watched jordan huh
12173,2020-12-30 01:28:45,kmr32a,Semantics but I'd say that LeBron is the best while mj is the greatest.
12174,2020-12-30 06:42:01,kmr32a,Lakers fan lmfao
12175,2020-12-30 00:53:15,kmr32a,Uh huh
12176,2020-12-30 02:42:31,kmr32a,[deleted]
12177,2020-12-30 20:40:25,kmr32a,"He’s never reacted well to physical things against him. Hence the flopping and continuous crying. He cries in video games. Again, I do believe he’s one of the most talented players ever, but best, nope."
12178,2020-12-30 04:11:02,kmr32a,"He handled it, but they changed the rules to make sure he could. He’s a great person, a great basketball player, but definitely not the best ever. Happy holidays. Endless debate."
12179,2020-12-31 01:46:02,kmr32a,Yeah I im not sure he'll catch up in rings but that wouldn't surprise me since he's on the Lakers and has a top level player like AD beside him and likely they will constantly upgrade the team.
12180,2020-12-30 05:02:03,kmr32a,"Love DH but he’s not an All-Star in 2 major professional sports. 

When I was a kid I thought we’d start seeing guys like Bo and Deion all the time. I’m still waiting."
12181,2020-12-30 06:47:14,kmr32a,Adrian Peterson that is all
12182,2020-12-30 05:00:27,kmr32a,But could he also hit a baseball 450 feet?
12183,2020-12-30 11:41:06,kmr32a,"Exactly. With Lebron it’s everything: dictating pace, accurate passes, seeing plays before they happen, jumping in front and getting steals and blocks. 

Just being a great passer doesn’t necessarily mean you have the best BBIQ"
12184,2020-12-30 02:38:39,kmr32a,Man raises a good point
12185,2020-12-30 02:37:54,kmr32a,"oh shit you're right, maybe Herro will be better"
12186,2020-12-30 16:30:04,kmr32a,I'll explain later.
12187,2020-12-30 18:49:06,kmr32a,"You had my attention, now you have my interest."
12188,2020-12-30 01:26:33,kmr32a,"OP also has a ton of flawed premises mixed into his post, like how curry is only a good shooter because he needed to be.  Not only does this disregard the fact that there are tons of shorter players who are bad shooters, it also disregards the fact that many all time great shooters were tall, like bird, durant, Miller, even his own teammate Klay.  Well written enough post but only skin deep analysis."
12189,2020-12-30 01:24:30,kmr32a,It's pretty clear you haven't either except for youtube highlights.
12190,2020-12-30 03:39:43,kmr32a,MJ was also the best
12191,2020-12-30 01:15:54,kmr32a,Mj was a more complete basketball player? Put down the god damn crack pipe.
12192,2020-12-30 03:09:47,kmr32a,"Lmao Jordan wouldn’t make the playoffs with them? Source. 

If we’re just pulling hot takes out of our ass - harden could’ve taken the 2018 cavs out of the 2018 eastern conference"
12193,2020-12-30 20:45:25,kmr32a,"This is just inaccurate. Honestly I have no fucking idea where it even comes from, it’s not based on any reality. It’s also the dumbass argument people used against Jordan when he was getting clotheslined by the pistons. 

Seriously—do you have any actual examples of Lebron reacting negatively to physical play? The fact that he’s so big and physical that he has to sell calls while little players like harden get touched a little and go to the line? That’s your argument? 

Also, who are you saying in the league is more physical than Lebron? Especially stars. 

I’m sorry, it’s just a dumbass, nonsense argument that people only listen to because it’s so nebulous and can’t be disproven. What do you even mean by physical? He’s not getting punched in the face so he’s not tough enough? You want Lawrence Taylor to tackle him on the way to the rim? Seriously, what do you want to see? What’s your proof?"
12194,2020-12-30 07:35:31,kmr32a,"Don't you think that's an extremely high standard though? Not trying to sound like or be a dick, but very few athletes have All-Starred in 2 pro sports. Do you feel like you're not giving athletes who don't play pro in two sports a fair shake? Geniuely curious, again, not trying to be a dick."
12195,2020-12-30 05:49:08,kmr32a,"I feel like he could. So many NFL and NBA elite athletes could easily make a name for themselves in the MLB if they trained for it from a young age.

Basically almost every NFL and NBA player who's ever played high school baseball has been drafted by the MLB straight out of high school at like 18, including Brady. These players instead choose to play college ball for 3-4 years and go into NFL at 22.

Like Brandon Weeden was a 2nd round MLB pick, returned to college, became a 1st round QB basically at 27."
12196,2020-12-30 13:55:34,kmr32a,"Jokic is much more than a great passer though, you obviously don't watch him enough.

&#x200B;

Not that I necessarily disagree with the take that LeBron has higher BBIQ than Jok, but Jok is definitely up there."
12197,2020-12-30 05:52:34,kmr32a,Is*
12198,2020-12-30 01:28:29,kmr32a,I didn’t even read that point tbh. I was just focusing on the fact that a new “GOAT” candidate seems to come in at the same time the previous one leaves
12199,2020-12-30 01:31:39,kmr32a,"Unfortunately, I’m probably old enough to be your dad. I’ve watched plenty of Jordan and Lebron."
12200,2020-12-30 03:57:50,kmr32a,I've come around on that personally. Like I said it's semantics though so it depends on your definition and criteria. They're basically 1a and 1b at this point because a good argument can be made for both.
12201,2020-12-30 01:19:04,kmr32a,"Let me ask you this on an unrelated note, do you think the star wars prequels are better than the original star wars movies?"
12202,2020-12-30 20:48:59,kmr32a,Anger... raaah. Bron D ride alert. Calm yourself
12203,2020-12-30 08:07:16,kmr32a,"Yes it’s an extremely high standard that’s the point, Bo and Deion reached it and made it look easy.

I was younger and thought athletes like that were gonna naturally become more frequent. 20+ years later they haven’t. 

Though I do put Lebron in that category I think he could’ve been an All-Pro in the NFL."
12204,2020-12-30 05:57:05,kmr32a,Let me know when one of them actually does it. Tons of guys get drafted in baseball but we are talking about All-Star level talent in both sports not Brandon Weedon.
12205,2020-12-30 06:22:52,kmr32a,"It's a little hard to see your point about NFL and NBA players easily being able to cross over to the MLB when one of your examples, (Weeden), alongside a few other high-profile cases (Russell Wilson, Shaq Thompson), ended up in the NFL because they weren't good enough to make the MLB."
12206,2020-12-30 16:19:15,kmr32a,"I agree he is up there, but saying that Jokic (who has generational BBIQ for his age) is on par with Lebrons 17 years of experience is almost an insult to lebron"
12207,2020-12-30 01:25:56,kmr32a,"Fuck no I’m not a casual hayden christiansen Stan 

I do think they’re overhated tho"
12208,2020-12-30 20:50:27,kmr32a,See? You don’t even have an argument. Simmer down with the trash takes.
12209,2020-12-30 08:18:14,kmr32a,"They may have made it look easy, but also, not everyone wants to do that. The way medical treatment has advanced does make sense for athletes to pursue other pro sports more, but that may just not what they want to do that.

I love LBJ, but idk if he could handle being hit like they do in the NFL. I can honestly see every close call, LBJ crying to the refs."
12210,2020-12-30 06:12:42,kmr32a,"You can discount Weeden all you want, but he got himself picked in the 2nd round of MLB. Bo Jack was 4th round.

But forget it. Nobody in the NFL and NBA give a shit about the MLB. It's a retirement/curious hobby like golfing. Kyler went 9th overall to the A's despite him continuously denying wanting to play MLB.

Just cause Bo Jack decided to go actually boycott the NFL and play MLB full time unlike everybody else doesn't make him special. 

Deion Sanders was an NFL GOAT and juggled an MLB career as a side hobby for the fuck of it.

Elway was picked in the 2nd and given a bigger bonus than the #1 overall...and he still basically used that as an excuse to get hinself traded from the Colts to Broncos and nothing else. MLB ain't shit."
12211,2020-12-30 06:26:16,kmr32a,"Kyler then. Elway. Deion. 

And for the record, many of the NFL players drafted never even played much baseball in college and were committed to football, hence why they were drafted late. My point is that crossover athletes don't give a f. about baseball."
12212,2020-12-30 17:35:46,kmr32a,"Lmao yeah cuz anyone else being good is an insult to lebron. I fully believe jokic sees the court the same way lebron, Kidd, Nash, cp3 do. And I fully believe none of you here can accurately tell me who has the best and worst court vision and IQ out of those 5, cuz they’re all geniuses and pretty much know what any defense will do. It’s not an insult to any of them, and lebron is a better player than all of them, but because of his athleticism and scoring."
12213,2020-12-30 01:30:22,kmr32a,"The popular opinion now among fans under 30 is that the prequels are better than the originals.  It happens when you grow up with something.  In your head that thing you grew up with is the best and nothing is going to dissuade you from it.  I'm not going to bother arguing Mj vs. LBJ just remember this when the next ""Goat"" player comes to challenge Lebron."
12214,2020-12-31 01:22:43,kmr32a,Just don’t care to debate w an angry bron guy. Better things to do. Take care kiddo
12215,2020-12-30 12:43:56,kmr32a,‘He cry’s to the refs’ because it works whether you like it or not. As op said people are a product of their circumstance. He obviously wouldn’t do this if he was in the nfl because if he tried it and it didn’t work he wouldn’t keep doing it
12216,2020-12-30 06:50:05,kmr32a,MLB drafts are huge and kind of a crap shoot.  Theres a pretty long development path after they are drafted and most guys end up being minor leaguers for life.
12217,2020-12-30 06:15:49,kmr32a,"I hate baseball but you’re just categorically wrong. You think Weedon gave up being an All-Star in baseball to ride the bench in the NFL? 

We are talking about humans who can be All-Stars in multiple sports so, yes, I will continue to discount Brandon Weedon."
12218,2020-12-30 01:56:13,kmr32a,"You thought I was going to say prequels huh.. be honest 

I’m 22 btw"
12219,2020-12-30 02:02:07,kmr32a,"I didnt care what your answer was going to be, the two are very different.  I just knew you were young and wanted you to see the parallel that exists in other mediums, that this is not a phenomenon exclusive to sports."
