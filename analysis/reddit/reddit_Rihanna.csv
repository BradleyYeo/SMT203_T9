&#x200B;

Arianna grande has that superstar ponytail presence

Camila has that latina heritage to lean on to

Lizzo has the female empowerment for plus size girls

Billie eilish has cool goth aesthetic

&#x200B;

Like I dont wanna name names but if your popgirl doesn't have a distinct brand that will generate interest from the GP and critics alike ...she ain't never gonna be a main pop girl."
19,2020-02-05 02:04:12,ez13u4,Having an aesthetic that can set you apart from the similar sounding artists on the charts and give audiences a shortcut to understanding your message
20,2020-02-05 01:54:44,ez13u4,I am still undecided on who the current pop stars of today are to actually assess the differences.

people are streaming billie eilish’s music, because they believe her depressed-kid image.

people are streaming Lizzo’s music, because she’s black, fat, and proud. people relate to that image.

people are streaming Cardi B’s music, because she’s the hood dream.

people are streaming Ariana Grande, because her ex’s death and her marriage call-off catapulted her into peak stardom.

people outside of the Pop fandom are not as concerned with Shawn Mendes, Camila Cabello, Dua Lupa, because nothing about them comes across as genuine. they are just pretty faces, trying to be the next pop star, while adhering to yesterday’s “How to Be a Pop Star” guide."
30,2020-02-05 01:33:45,ez13u4,"This.. 

And being able to grasp the attention of the GP and keep it. Let's be real, people nowadays are all types of distracted and disconnected. So I think today's world is a mix of social media, and being able to connect with your listeners."
31,2020-02-05 01:44:57,ez13u4,Yes. With that is fan interaction. We want them to feed us at all times.
32,2020-02-05 03:03:58,ez13u4,"This right here. Social media has changed everything, celebrities who don’t interact with their fans and be slightly transparent about themselves on social media will suffer career wise. Fans will move on and favourite other celebrities who are more interactive. The whole, “mysterious is better” way to go is outdated *unless you’re already established with years in the industry under your belt.*"
33,2020-02-05 01:40:35,ez13u4,Is it? Madison Beer has almost double the amount of Instagram followers Lizzo has
34,2020-02-05 04:03:49,ez13u4,BTS is a good example of that.
35,2020-02-05 02:06:55,ez13u4,My hot take: rappers are the pop stars now since they're the ones moving the culture
36,2020-02-05 02:17:47,ez13u4,probably Billie Ariana Cardi and Lizzo are the breakout stars of the past two years and girls like Rihanna Gaga Beyonce still maintain A-list relevancy
37,2020-02-05 02:28:39,ez13u4,"ariana is a pretty solid choice rn. other than her it’s all up for debate if you want to consider lizzo, dua, billie, camila, etc. as pop stars"
38,2020-02-05 04:03:43,ez13u4,Ariana Billie Taylor
39,2020-02-05 03:04:57,ez13u4,"I haven’t seen it asked before, sorry"
40,2020-02-05 04:10:03,ez13u4,"Alternatively sometimes the lack of interaction is good too, makes them seem ~mysterious~ or almost otherworldly? Like how Beyonce almost never captions her photos and posts them in 3’s for the aesthetic."
41,2020-02-05 01:43:59,ez13u4,Okay but how much time will Lizzo keep making hits? Someone like Billie who was way more engagement is way more likely to continue relevant
42,2020-02-05 03:14:48,ez13u4,"Actually, I think social media would count as a negative for Lizzos career"
43,2020-02-05 02:40:12,ez13u4,">since they're the ones moving the culture

&#x200B;

absolutely. Atlanta has been the epicenter of mainstream culture for the last two decades. and there are no signs of that changing anytime soon."
44,2020-02-05 02:57:12,ez13u4,"Ariana is an interesting choice. I feel like a large part of her TUN success had to do with the clarity and emotionality of the narrative. Post Mac, post Manchester. Further, having gone through such pain she was able to channel it into her art w her friends and make a fire fuckin album. I’m curious as to where she goes next and whether or not she’ll be able to maintain the momentum. 

She’s definitely shot up into the top tier and she’s always had successful singles, but I wonder what happens next."
45,2020-02-05 02:35:38,ez13u4,"yeah if we're talking about the last 2-3 years i am just wondering where people like Drake, Post Malone, The Weeknd, Travis Scott and Lil Nas X fit in due to their immense popularity and influence."

234,2020-02-04 22:45:56,eyxqoo,"I don't mind celebrity makeup lines if the makeup matches the celebrity's signature style.

Lady Gaga struck out big time.  She's known for her out there and wild looks on the red carpet (hello meat dress) yet her first palette was something you could have seen any other brand do. It was just so generic.  Even more of a missed opportunity was that an edgy gothy brand was taking a steep nosedive and the opening was right there on a silver platter.  

To me her line would be like Taylor Swift releasing a makeup line without red lipstick."
235,2020-02-04 21:55:22,eyxqoo,"Absolutely oversaturated! Many makeup lovers & collectors have slowly been getting brand/makeup fatigue. But this comes in waves. 

We all had a time where we excited to try all these new things and to get this palette or this single eyeshadow, so on. As that wave becomes more of a collector rather than an enthusiast, more waves will come. Younger generations will buy into these new brands, just like we did with Colourpop, Fenty, etc. Then eventually they too will get to the point many of us are.

A video by BeautyNews explained this beautifully. While it is oversaturated and although many of us feel like there’s no more room for brands, there are always new, developing makeup lovers who will find excitement in a new brand while many “seasoned” makeup lovers find it unnecessary to the market."
236,2020-02-04 22:26:54,eyxqoo,"I don't care too much about how many celebs launch makeup lines, but I do care when it's a half-assed effort lol. 

Victoria, Rihanna and heck, even Kesha can stay (I don't listen to her music but her palette is lovely!)

but Millie and Gaga....just, so unwarranted lol"
237,2020-02-04 23:56:40,eyxqoo,"Even worse than the celebs, I'm tired of every Joe Schmoe ""influencer"" coming out with their own makeup or collab or whatever. Giant eyeroll for every new influencer palette release. I was entertained by Jaclyn Hill's lipstick release fiasco. Just because you have X followers doesn't mean you know a thing about running a business, formulating stuff, or PR."
238,2020-02-04 22:22:10,eyxqoo,"It’s getting way overdone, especially when some celebrity beauty lines bring nothing new to the table. Fenty influenced a lot of makeup brands to expand their shade ranges when they noticed what an overwhelming amount of people finally found a shade that matched their’s. You have old, traditional brands like Estée Lauder that used to have 17 shades of light-medium, and then less than 10 for everything between medium-dark. I saw Millie’s line at Ulta and while I’m not sure if that was the brand’s intention, it seems geared to tweens/teens to get into makeup without going for a heavy makeup look. But it feels like a lot of celebrity makeup/cosmetic brands nowadays are the same palettes, same lipsticks just repackaged and re-priced."
239,2020-02-05 00:24:34,eyxqoo,"100%. 

That is why I’m super selective on what I support with my money. What made Rihanna’s line so successful from the start, was that she came out with a huge range of foundation tones and they marketed that very well. She gave a solution to a problem that we all have - finding the perfect match for our skin.

And with Selena Gomez, eh, never thought of her as someone that has great makeup looks. We’ll see how she markets her line and what will make it stand out from the over saturation there is in the industry."
240,2020-02-04 23:16:08,eyxqoo,"I'm also finding that we aren't using all of our products in different and interesting ways because it's just SO EASY to buy new. There's so much out there, and yet most of it goes off before it can be used."
241,2020-02-04 22:48:24,eyxqoo,Makeup lines are the new album releases by actors/movies from singers.
242,2020-02-04 23:49:07,eyxqoo,"Honestly! I got a $150 gift card for Sephora and like two years ago I would've been so hyped abt that but now ??? Makeup is all the same, not inspired by anything out rn"
243,2020-02-05 00:18:12,eyxqoo,I feel the makeup fatigue as well. I've actually returned to some drugstore favorites. Cover girl foundation and maybelline mascara. Honestly I've tried and $$paid$$ for a lot of premium makeup and I'm just over it.
244,2020-02-05 01:12:44,eyxqoo,This is definitely a missed opportunity to name it Glowmez.

246,2020-02-05 00:56:32,eyxqoo,"I’m really liking the trend of affordable quality makeup such as makeup revolution, colourpop, juvia’s place, etc. My fav foundation is the stick one from makeup revolution."
247,2020-02-04 23:33:43,eyxqoo,"I generally don’t buy celeb or Influencer makeup, idk there is way too much out there, I don’t need to get more shit every time there’s hype around it."
248,2020-02-05 00:01:31,eyxqoo,"They're huge money, so it isn't going to stop any time soon. Basically every celeb has a fragrance and this to me feels the same. I think if there's effort put in and it's something they give a shit about (or are willing to hire experts who give a shit) it's fine- MBB's line was so panned it probably won't last, and makeup lines go under all the time, so I have no problem with them trying. The good ones will usually rise to the top."
249,2020-02-05 00:10:08,eyxqoo,"I generalllly don't buy influencer/celebrity makeup. I don't know. I'm a bit exhausted with all the new launches. I think that if a celebrity does start their own line though, they need to have an edge for me to be attracted. It feels like a lot of the products just come out of the same factories and are similar."
250,2020-02-04 22:47:42,eyxqoo,Yes I was just thinking this the other day. There are so many companies and palettes now that it is too much. I try to read this sub and get a feel for what are the best brands then buy from them.
251,2020-02-05 01:19:53,eyxqoo,"I don’t think the problem is that it’s makeup, but that it’s the same as everything else. I get that you can only make so many x color of eyeshadows, but there are things I think missing, like an epic duo chrome pallet, a cream shadow pallet. Or even single shadow pallets with a beautiful esthetic. I just think there is for sure a market, it’s just the same releases on repeat that get boring. I don’t care who makes it, I just want something  different, new textures and formulas, a well thought out design, etc"
252,2020-02-05 05:06:11,eyxqoo,"Remember perfume and celebrities? Back in the 1990s and 2000s, it seemed like every pop star had their own perfume. I'd bet that most of them had no experience in fragrance or chemistry. But hey, it sold. 

Do I believe Britney Spears and Justin Bieber were were sitting in a lab somewhere trying to formulate the perfect scent? God no. But half the girls I knew had a teal bottle of Curious on their dresser. 

Make up is a brilliant idea. You can only buy so many bottles of perfume in a year, but you can always use more makeup. 

And if it's not the celebrity that sells it, then it's the franchise. Look a Harry Potter palette. A Disney palette. Are these new colors that have never existed in the spectrum before? No, not really. But put them together with a theme and you've got a hit. People eat that up."
253,2020-02-05 00:25:20,eyxqoo,I've also grown tired of makeup after the market saturation reached a certain point a couple years back. it's been so overwhelming. not to mention the prices of most of it has just been beyond my budget so I can't even get excited about trying anything.
254,2020-02-05 00:31:15,eyxqoo,"As annoyed/fatigued as I am with the industry as a whole, my wallet is so happy lol 😂 I’m really hoping to continue only rebuying products I love, like foundation, face wash, sponges, etc. Only two YouTubers got me last year with their palette launches, but that’s because they partnered with brands that I already trusted/enjoyed. I was intrigued by others, but not enough to buy anything."
255,2020-02-05 09:52:47,eyxqoo,"Am I the only one who’s really bothered by all the plastic waste being accumulated by all of these makeup lines being constantly launched? Unless you’re presenting something original and refreshing, yet another makeup line entering the market is not necessary. Celebrities can’t just do collabs anymore?"
256,2020-02-05 02:40:31,eyxqoo,The world does not need another highlighter .
257,2020-02-05 01:13:42,eyxqoo,"I don’t understand the need everyone feels to own all these celebrity makeup products. I hate wasting money but love makeup, so I have two pallets (one neutral and one colourful) and that does me just fine! I’m excited for Selena’s new line though because the concept sounds refreshing. Loving her take on beauty and makeup being for you, not others. Hoping she has some nice products"
258,2020-02-05 02:26:11,eyxqoo,"I definitely think so. My new year resolution was to not buy any new makeup because I barely get excited for the new stuff coming out anymore. It's getting very stagnant and no one's really as creative anymore. The only makeup line I get excited about is Melt Cosmetics. Their palettes are ridiculously saturated and they have bright unique colours that show up on my dark skin in one swipe. I feel like makeup newbies still have something to get excited about, but as a self proclaimed makeup addict, everything else is just meh."
259,2020-02-05 06:12:24,eyxqoo,"Yes,  there's too much of it 

 The only things I'll be buying consistently: mascara, powder, primer, and lipstick (obviously as replacements). 

I have enough highlighter, palettes, and blush to last for years.  I'm kind of just over it, I'm just glad I don't wear foundation, those usually run high."
260,2020-02-05 11:23:34,eyxqoo,"Oversaturated for sure, but I'm glad Posh Spice got in there with her own line. Her eyeshadows are FIRE."
261,2020-02-05 01:39:45,eyxqoo,"Honestly, I only buy the make-up that I truly like and I genuinely feel interested in once I see the package, colors and final products. 

It has become an over-saturated market but at the same time, there’s an extensive variety for different types of people! 

Maybe, try not to feel like you necessarily gotta buy all of it just because you’re into make-up,  just buy what you absolutely love, and enjoy it while it lasts lol. 

Edit: I fixed some typos that this comment had since I’m posting from my phone."
262,2020-02-05 01:46:13,eyxqoo,I love makeup! Collecting it is my hobby. I don’t wear it nearly as much as I once did. I’m also a complete snob. Buying the next big brand is not my thing. I stick to my favorite brands that I know  are worth the spend. Testing new lines is exhausting and tend to be wasteful for me.
263,2020-02-05 03:39:07,eyxqoo,"The amount of celeb makeup brands is over  broad, however, if the certain celebrity is *passionate* about makeup or starting anew brand (like Fenty, or Victoria Beckham) then I’m down. 

Many, and most, companies are cash grabs. Let’s be honest, but if there are somewhat good interiors or creative/passion for the products it deserves recognition. It’s hard to saw of Selena’s line with hit the mark, since I never saw her makeup inspiring.

I think right now it’s kind of a trend that Kylie Jenner and Rihanna pushed. I won’t be surprised if fashion brands become just as popular among celebrities (already is starting), or easy, targetable markets."
264,2020-02-05 03:41:42,eyxqoo,I think makeup in general has become an oversaturated market. I also feel disinterested because I can't keep up lol
265,2020-02-05 05:56:38,eyxqoo,"I doubt most will still be around in a few years. Remember when making a fragrance was the big thing? Britney was one of the first.. then you had everyone from Jessica Simpson to SJP to Paris Hilton.

The celebs are still pumping them out too! But I think a lot of the older ones that weren’t as successful are no longer around. I imagine the same for makeup."
266,2020-02-05 01:46:42,eyxqoo,"Honestly, I haven’t bought a new foundation or eyeshadow palette in two years. Makeup is supposed to add to your beauty, so I only use a little. Eyeshadow can be used in so many different combinations and ways. I think that you just find something that works, and stick to it haha."
267,2020-02-05 02:39:35,eyxqoo,"I find it interesting that there is a lot of negativity here around Millie’s line, and (aside from some obvious stupid mistakes, like the skincare video) I think that is probably indicative of the age of this sub. 

Her line is not appealing at all to me, personally. But I think she is SO smart to be one of the first brands out there that is specifically targeting Gen Z. They’re growing in spending power every year. I think that we’re going to see a lot of brands start to pop up that emulate this in the next year or two. It’s selling very well because it targets the right market. 

In general, I’m okay with a celeb line if it has a point of view/personality and is interesting. I love VB’s line - I think it’s so well done. Fenty is a powerhouse. Lady Gaga has failed at hers because she lacked those things. I don’t love Selena’s branding so far, but am curious to see what her angle is."
268,2020-02-05 02:51:27,eyxqoo,"Definitely over saturated sector but I can say I do like what Selena’s line stand for which is about makeup that show the uniqueness rather than trying to look like everyone else. 

There are way too many influencers and celebrities with makeup lines that all focus on this heavy face makeup and they all have that same Kardashian/Jenner/influencer makeup aesthetic (if you knowI’m saying) . But I feel like hers seems like a more fresh face, use make up the way you want to, without conforming. So I’m excited to see what her line has to offer."
269,2020-02-05 01:47:51,eyxqoo,"I feel like the industry in general is oversaturated with the exact same products over and over and over to the point I dont even need to buy anything anymore, I have everything I could ever need in 4-6 palettes I've accumulated over a few years (lol @ my expired makeup I def still use every now and then whoops). If I need brights, I have 2 good palettes, nudes, browns, and plums take up the rest. It's almost impossible to find something that stands out and at this point I feel like celebs don't care about quality, and I would say the same about most YouTube MUAs too. It's just getting boring at this point because they're all releasing the same stuff and wont stop releasing the same stuff, even when begged by their audience."
270,2020-02-05 02:59:18,eyxqoo,I definitely find celeb brands to be overrated. There's always a shit ton of hype and the products don't often wow me.
271,2020-02-05 04:23:09,eyxqoo,"I don’t get why she announced it so far in advance. Gaga did this too and legit everyone forgot about it and then it dropped and the reaction wasn’t explosive it was just “huh, I forgot that was going to happen!”"
272,2020-02-05 08:20:18,eyxqoo,"I’ve always loved Selena Gomez and think she’s the most gorgeous girl ever, but when I saw she was coming out with a makeup line my first thought was “...really”.  Especially when she named it after her newly released album- seems weird to me. I sincerely hope that her brand is good though, I lose respect for people who release products just for the heck of it. Fenty Beauty and Tati Beauty are two brands that I can think of that really seem like a lot of passion went into them and a lot of effort, and I personally use their products and love them. Allie Glines just released a makeup bag today, which I think is awesome and I am thinking of purchasing. At the end of the day it’s really obvious when a product is well thought out and when it isn’t, and I’m hoping Selena’s brand is good because I love her and would hate to lose respect for her lol. She’s really gonna have to release something innovative or unique for me to be on board."
273,2020-02-05 09:43:11,eyxqoo,"I think the over saturation of makeup is helping me buy less tbh. When there were less releases and more hyped up products, there was this 'gotta collect them all' mentality. Nowadays even once over hyped brands are not as popular because they're releasing too much (I'm looking at you abh) and people have stopped 'collecting' their palettes because it's no longer feasible (if it ever was). 

There's so much competition now that brands and people need to be making the best quality products. The most standout products to catch people's eyes."
274,2020-02-05 10:03:27,eyxqoo,"I started buying less but better quality - I have my go to products that might cost more but don't spark any rush of ""I NEED TO BUY THIS"" fomo effect. I'm quite happy with my small collection as it is and I haven't used it up yet as of almost 3 years. I don't see or feel the need to have yet another nude palette just because someone slapped their trademark on it. Also it saves a fuckton of money. No one cares nor knows if you have HAUS, Chanel or Essence red lipstick - as long as it looks nice it's all people would see. A red lipstick"
275,2020-02-05 14:02:57,eyxqoo,"I will support any celebrity that is genuinely intrested in the process of make up, Involved on how its made and what value it brings the consumer. Unfortunately a lot of celebrities are just slapping their brand on and give not a single care in the world what is in their products or how it could harm/ affect the consumer. That is why I usually stick to make up brands that show they have a genuine intrest in what the consumer wants, high quality products and there is research to backup on why they have chosen their products."
276,2020-02-05 03:43:11,eyxqoo,"Millie didn’t just create a makeup line- she created a skincare line. It’s honestly really smart marketing, targeting the teen demographic of her followers, and her whole “brand” is self love and acceptance, which is perfect for Florence By Mills, with lots of sayings about loving the skin your in and how self care is important."
277,2020-02-05 03:52:07,eyxqoo,"This is why I’ve been switching to indie brands. While there is always a risk as you cannot swatch in person prior to purchasing, by watching videos of swatches I’ve been very happy with almost everything I have bought. 
Not all indie makeup is cheap, and wait times for shipping can be over a month as many products are made by hand. However, as this thread is pointing out, I’ve just gotten overwhelmed and frustrated at the over saturation of makeup releases. Also, if I’m going to spend money on makeup, I would rather it go for quality versus paying for advertising and a brand name. 
My favorite indie purchases so far: 

Clionadh stained glass eye shadows 

JD Glow highlighter (shades Marilyn and Chaos) 

Terra Moon eyeshadows"
278,2020-02-05 02:07:57,eyxqoo,"I mean, ya"
279,2020-02-05 03:19:50,eyxqoo,"I do feel overwhelmed with just so much new makeup being released in general. But, as long as the quality is good, I don't mind."
280,2020-02-05 05:17:11,eyxqoo,"The makeup industry is one of the few least practical markets. Makeups aren't organized by functions in sections. Instead they are arbitrarily placed mostly based on brands, but even brands can be all over the place in the store. Not oversaturated at all, just a few big companies making everything. Package things a little differently and sell it as a different product. It's actually not very different from the fashion industry in terms of competition, branding, and logistics, probably a lot of the same people too."
281,2020-02-05 05:31:38,eyxqoo,"I would be interested in Gwen Stefani's line P8nt if it ever came out. What you waiting for? Lol My luck it would not be vegan like her UD collab palette, so I wouldn't get it anyway."
282,2020-02-05 07:55:06,eyxqoo,I feel the same. Too many celebrities hopping on the cash wagon and coming out with shitty products no one needs (\*cough\* haus labs)
283,2020-02-05 09:39:22,eyxqoo,"I guess it's just me but there are some of these who I don't feel they have a real passion for their clients. Like The Honest Line(Jessica Alba), she seems so sincere. I really like Meaningful Beauty (Cindy Crawford), Dr Landers (Candace Cameron)..I am just picky and  typically don't trust celebs much anymore. I don't like the hate and condescending hypocrisy of some.  I think I can find plenty with professional cosmeticians and natural chemists."
284,2020-02-05 09:43:44,eyxqoo,I thought the same thing when I saw the announcement for Rare Beauty. Even not celebrity makeup brands seem to be oversaturating the market with release after release of new new new. And now with celebrities starting their own brands it does seem like a lot. It's kind of a turn off to me personally as a consumer.
285,2020-02-05 09:47:08,eyxqoo,Can't wait for Justin beibers skincare line. 😂
286,2020-02-05 10:33:02,eyxqoo,"Gomez is just tryna stay relevant since 13 Reasons Why isn't popular anymore, guarantee you her makeup line is gonna flop. No one will give it the time of day, unless it sucks in which case everyone will blast it."
287,2020-02-05 11:12:55,eyxqoo,"I totally agree with you! I don't even use make-up that often but when I try getting into it, like when purchasing a new palette I feel so overwhelmed and just go back to my old stuff. I would love to experiment a lot more, but like you said makeup sector is oversaturated."
288,2020-02-05 11:16:17,eyxqoo,"I am actually very excited for this one. Selena has always been a big part of my life as a Gen Z kid. I basically frew up with her, not to mention that she is literally so drop dead gorgeous. I have literally been a fan since I first saw her, and honestly I feel like this is going to be a good line. I wouldn’t expect anything less from her, I am honestly expecting a natural line of products but we will see. Nonetheless I am super stoked for this one."
289,2020-02-05 17:47:17,eyxqoo,It's always gonna be a massive thing from here on out as it's what women rely on more than anything else.
290,2020-02-05 00:33:47,eyxqoo,Absolutely. I (a guy) still love makeup but I’ve started to ignore a lot because there’s just too much. Haven’t bought anything major like a palette in almost two years. Don’t see that changing anytime soon.
291,2020-02-05 04:07:46,eyxqoo,"I think its good. I remember back  in 2007 there were only a couple of big cosmetic companies. This is before NYX blew up. It was MAC, Urban Decay and Revlon. This was way back when Temptalia didn't even have her blog/ Then after the beauty YT blew up there were soooooo many new brands to try and it was no longer monopolized.

&#x200B;

I think competition works for the consumers favor. Now  we have so many to choose from and it definitely is a good thing. I dont have to spend $44 on Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer, there we like 20+ to choose from at every price point. Yes, there is good and bad  with all the new companies. Yes, ABH and colourpop does a colab with every single person on YT. I think its mostly good tho. we have so many options and back in early 2000s it wasnt like that"
292,2020-02-04 22:55:28,eyxqoo,"Thank god I don’t care about celeb makeup..it never draws me in and I can continue to lose money on overbuying products I already have cuz I’m honestly petrified of ever running out of products >_>. Like, I’m busy."

294,2020-02-05 01:47:51,eyxqoo,"I’m finding that there’s a lot of product out there, but no real difference to each other. 

I think that’s why everyone went crazy over the Jeffree Star X Shane Dawson collab, it was a new, fresh idea of what makeup can be."
295,2020-02-05 04:03:28,eyxqoo,"I think there’s room for more of the celebrities in question A. Pay attention to their target demographics and B. Bring something special to the table (this goes for all makeup brands really).

Rihanna is so clearly passionate and involved with her makeup brand, and keeps bringing something new to the table, such as her iconic shade range, and usually does so with good quality. Even the snap shadow palettes, while iffy in quality, were still a unique idea!

And as much as I’m not a Kardashian fan, Kylie cosmetics knows it’s customers and consistently puts out cute, quality releases.

Lady Gaga is the other end of the spectrum. She had so much promise of both diverse and unique makeup, and then released 4 white girl nude lip sets and an obligatory red. Liquid eyeshadows might have been breaking the mold 5 years ago, but right now everyone has them and in better formulas and colors too. It was so underwhelming and not at all what people hoped for from her. She just put very safe, low quality choices in edgy packaging like people wouldn’t notice. 

Brands that insist on putting out played out item, especially when the celebrity face clearly doesn’t care about the product either, are definitely over saturated. Brands that actually put in work, ensure quality and a unique style, all while having the founder actively represent the brand can still find room."
296,2020-02-05 01:10:29,eyxqoo,"I find these posts to be so annoying. Who the hell cares if there are a billion makeup lines? Is \*this\* what is taking up space in your mind? Who the hell cares? Just don't buy it and move on. 

I feel just as annoyed when people post about colourpop and it's gazillion launches. Who the hell cares?! It's not important."
297,2020-02-05 11:45:28,eyxqoo,"You don't have to keep up if you don't want to.


Do you like what's already on your table? Good. No need to buy new just because a celeb made it.


Matter if fact you can use what you already have to dupe the celeb makeup. It requires  good color vision, but I had a whole YouTube series on how to make crayon lipgloss dupes of Kylie cosmetics in your own home"
298,2020-02-05 00:11:44,eyxqoo,"Yes, Rihanna's line really reflects her personality. She does minimal releases and the quality is on point. That's the way to do a celebrity makeup line if they want to do one. 

Being a celebrity will get you initial sales, but if they are going to charge Sephora prices for their line they need to have the quality and aesthetic to back it up. Otherwise customers will just feel let down and will be unlikely to buy anything from them again. Not to mention it will reflect poorly on them in general. It's really not something a celebrity should do unless they love it and are committed to doing it right despite their already busy schedules.

Edit: I don't know anything about Selena Gomez's line, but she seems pretty savvy. I think she'll probably do a good job."
299,2020-02-04 23:11:21,eyxqoo,Gaga should be the replacement for KVD in the market in terms of artistic effort and edge.
300,2020-02-05 00:24:26,eyxqoo,"I feel like the only celebrity make up line that's actually worth it is Fenty. It has the authenticity, dedication, and quality that all other celeb brands lack."
301,2020-02-05 00:03:41,eyxqoo,"Completely spot on. 

I really like the aesthetic VB's line; those smoky eye bricks are VB in a pan. Too expensive for me to justify, but definitely lovely. Same with Lisa Eldridge."
302,2020-02-05 00:18:52,eyxqoo,"I actually just took a peek on the Haus Labs website and I’m a lot more impressed than I was originally. The original promo photos were okay, but it reminded me way too much of the 80’s glam rock days and yes, the eyeshadow palette is just straight up boring and uninspired.

But she has some cool products like reusable cat eye stickers that come in different sizes/shapes and apparently blend in seamlessly with her eyeliner. And another sticker set that creates a masquerade ball-look. I’m not into liquid eyeshadows at all, but she has created an extensive collection with unique colors that I haven’t seen from other brands before (there’s probably a bunch out there, I just haven’t seen any brands spend much time on marketing their liquid shadows or heard influencers or even non-influencers talk about them much). 

Shrug. I had expected more from Lady Gaga’s original launch, but it looks like this is just the beginning. Hopefully she takes it up a notch and gives us something truly unique."
303,2020-02-05 00:07:07,eyxqoo,"True maybe more was expected from her first launch, but in the video she did with NikkieTutorials she explained the inspiration behind the palette (and the brand as a whole). IIRC it was the shades she used to throw on really quick when she was performing in bars, or something like that. Plus, Lady Gaga is now known for a lot more than her whacky outfits."
304,2020-02-05 04:36:46,eyxqoo,Yes!!!! I get so bored seeing the same nude palettes being essentially resold under a different celeb name. I hope Selena makes hers unique.
305,2020-02-05 07:22:47,eyxqoo,It reminds me of the Gwen Stefani collab w UD that was all classic/neutrals
306,2020-02-04 22:03:35,eyxqoo,"Yes, makeup fatigue is a real thing. I think this also parallels with my goals for 2020. I want to live more sustainably and not buy an excess amount of makeup that will just sit around and eventually get thrown out because it’s expired. I’m trying to only repurchase when I’m actually out of a foundation, mascara..etc. I’m also trying to save more this year and not just throw money at the hottest makeup trend or item that month."
307,2020-02-05 04:51:20,eyxqoo,"To be fair, at least Millie's brand is appealing to a certain demographic (pre-teens and teenagers). Im sure as hell not buying it but it's not meant for me."
308,2020-02-05 01:15:01,eyxqoo,[deleted]
309,2020-02-05 04:38:43,eyxqoo,"HOWEVER— someone like Tina Yong, who’s been a small business owner and certified makeup artist for a decade or two, is much more trustworthy I feel. Her combination palette was lovely and quite useful and I never felt like she was trying to shove anything down her followers throats at all. 

There’s definitely a right way to do something like that."
310,2020-02-05 01:50:55,eyxqoo,"> Jaclyn Hill's lipstick release fiasco

Wow, I don't follow Jaclyn Hill but I used to watch her videos a few years ago, I unsubscribed because I thought she was just going a bit crazy honestly. I had NO idea about her cosmetics and just spent like an hour digging into the drama. Crazy!"
311,2020-02-05 00:10:04,eyxqoo,Yes I totally agree!
312,2020-02-05 18:02:42,eyxqoo,Look I’m just waiting for my boy wubby to release his anime tiddies pallet
313,2020-02-04 23:45:33,eyxqoo,"I'm almost totally sure it's for people just getting into skin care. Like, this is what your mom will buy you now if you're turning 13 this year."
314,2020-02-04 22:59:47,eyxqoo,I don't understand how a 16 year old girl has a makeup and skincare line. That one boggles my mind. I have blemishes older than her.
315,2020-02-05 01:58:04,eyxqoo,Totally agree... I'd be more likely to support a Selena Gomez hair-care line than makeup cos I've been envious of her hair for years lol
316,2020-02-05 08:27:20,eyxqoo,"Completely agree, I've never viewed Selena Gomez as inspiring in the makeup department. Although I'm sure getting your makeup professionally done 100 times over will give you an appreciation for the makeup industry. I think a skin care line would've suited her better because she embodies natural beauty, but we will see."
317,2020-02-05 14:09:26,eyxqoo,I honestly can't even picture Selena with a full Glam look. I feel like the most I've ever seen her do is a red lip?
318,2020-02-04 23:18:16,eyxqoo,"Yup, which creates an issue with overconsumption and waste."
319,2020-02-05 02:18:24,eyxqoo,I think you switched those up by accident
320,2020-02-05 00:29:26,eyxqoo,I'd spend it on skincare now
321,2020-02-05 00:20:35,eyxqoo,Totally agree. I got a gift card and spent it all on skin care LOL
322,2020-02-05 05:27:51,eyxqoo,"Yes! New brands are great, but I think drugstore brands have really stepped up their game in recent years. I can easily buy something for half the price of a highstreet or premium product, and it works just as well, or even better."
323,2020-02-04 23:41:58,eyxqoo,">Tati is lovely, but I think she has no idea about health , yet promotes vitamins.

Yeah, I like Tati, but these vitamins are nothing something id promote personally. Doctors always say that if you are lacking in any particular vitamin, its better to eat foods with that vitamin in it. Doctor Mike on Youtube discourages people from using vitamins, unless directed by a doctor. Plus vitamins are not regulated. They can say they have x amount of vitamin c in it, but that may not even be the case."
324,2020-02-05 01:30:48,eyxqoo,I love Revolution.
325,2020-02-05 03:59:52,eyxqoo,"Love yourself by buying my products!

Oh capitalism, you sneaky lil’ sneak."
326,2020-02-05 01:44:28,eyxqoo,Well you are in a makeup sub .
327,2020-02-05 00:12:12,eyxqoo,I think Melt might be going for that market.  Their Muerte palette is like nothing else on the market (and great).
328,2020-02-04 23:15:35,eyxqoo,Yes and she was handed the opportunity on a silver platter.  She blew it big time.
329,2020-02-04 23:19:26,eyxqoo,"This is a brilliant idea & I hope Gaga sees it, executes it, then thank yous for it!"
330,2020-02-05 02:24:12,eyxqoo,Victoria Beckham's stuff is really great too.
331,2020-02-05 05:47:45,eyxqoo,"Jeffree Star's quality is amazing, and it's mostly (all?) vegan. I don't know if he's necessarily a celeb in the way we're saying here, but he's def top tier imo."
332,2020-02-05 04:01:15,eyxqoo,I just looked up the cat eye stickers. Omg this changes everything.
333,2020-02-05 04:31:54,eyxqoo,"The interview was honestly really cool. She loves the colors and wants people to use them in their everyday shades, not just for ""fun"" looks."
334,2020-02-05 16:48:57,eyxqoo,"Gaga's always been very extra with her style and makeup.  I expected her brand to reflect that.

Releasing a blah neutral palette is as off character for her as KKW beauty releasing a rainbow palette."
335,2020-02-05 13:48:01,eyxqoo,"I think Kesha made her's unique enough (and it had rainbow and glitter in it, which is a given for her)."
336,2020-02-05 00:19:32,eyxqoo,"I'm not quite there yet, but I admire you. I am trying to focus on things I really want though. I let stuff sit in my cart for a while so I don't impulse buy anything. And if I buy something pretty I try to do something that will last like eyeshadow since I know I can sanitize that and keep it for years. I rarely buy liquid lipsticks anymore as they seem far less sanitary than a bullet lipstick I can cut the end off of. It will go bad still, but my dead lip skin won't be sitting in there for a year lol. I've been sanitizing and wiping down all my palettes and blushes which makes them look much newer and nicer and also reminds me of all the makeup I have. I also added everything in the database that I can to my vanity on Temptalia's sight so I can check for dupes I already have of things. I'll get there!"
337,2020-02-05 03:12:46,eyxqoo,"I'm just getting into makeup and clueless and the insanely huge variety and options has had me suck in analysisparalysis for a couple months. I have no idea what's good, what's a must have basic, what's the trash or a waste or not for beginners and so on.

And the pricing doesn't help on a lot of this stuff..."
338,2020-02-05 01:56:10,eyxqoo,I’m doing the same thing :)
339,2020-02-05 11:52:44,eyxqoo,"Very true. 

The worsening quality of my skin pushed me to take a break from makeup in 2015. 
Next thing you know its October and I haven't worn any foundation, voncealer  , blush ect for the year ...



And I'm stretching out wearing any makeup on my face by 2 weeks at a time



I still follow that routeen and my skin is smoother"
340,2020-02-08 15:09:55,eyxqoo,Millies line gives me a glossier vibe but available in person. Ive actually thought about trying it since I perfer very minimal natural makeup & thats what she seems to cater to.
341,2020-02-05 01:51:45,eyxqoo,"I didn’t know it existed until I saw a display at ulta, the marketing was amazing for young girls (tweens / teens). If I had a daughter or was that age myself I would definitely gravitate towards it. I was honestly impressed."
342,2020-02-05 07:28:18,eyxqoo,"I bought the Tina Yong palette even though I have mostly stopped watching her (no shade, just got bored of a lot of makeup videos) because the colours were so different from almost everything that was coming out last year. 

It has ended up being my favourite palette I've purchased in the last few years. The quality is so good and if I'm travelling, I only have to take that one palette and I can do several different looks.

Sorry to gush. I really love it but I never see anyone talking about it."
343,2020-02-05 03:59:16,eyxqoo,"Now, I'll have to look it up, bcz I don't follow anything,  but drama. lol"
344,2020-02-05 00:19:16,eyxqoo,"I mean she's a famous and successful 16 year old, she has the means to do so. Look how much Billie Eilish and many other young stars have accomplished at 16. At her age I was using products that probably did more harm than good (cleansers that stripped the skin, very abrasive scrubs etc) so props to her if it introduces teens to better products."
345,2020-02-05 00:03:28,eyxqoo,"I like the thought of taking care of your skin at a younger age, but I'm pretty sure the products are all shit solely because it seems like a kids play make up brand."
346,2020-02-05 12:26:20,eyxqoo,Totally agree! Unfortunately I am sure she cannot launch her own hair products because she has previously been in commercials for hair care brands. She totally missed out!
347,2020-02-05 00:16:54,eyxqoo,"This! Would love to see someone create a clean, sustainable beauty brand, where you can order refills of some sort, everything is sourced ethically, labor is paid fairly, and it does not come in so much plastic. 
In addition to it being available in-store so that it helps not create such a huge carbon footprint, as opposed to everyone having to order exclusively online."
348,2020-02-05 02:23:46,eyxqoo,"I watched a short video the other day about recycling makeup packaging. Apparently a lot of it is too small to be recognised by the scanners and ends up in landfill. As well as this, the light used to scan items bounces off packaging that is black, which also means it gets sent to landfill. So we recycle and it doesn't do any good"
349,2020-02-05 02:23:17,eyxqoo,"I mean actors who release a music single/album and singers who star in film/tv as a way to expand their career. Instead of putting out a terrible song, celebrities just put out a terrible makeup line."
350,2020-02-05 00:37:24,eyxqoo,"Honestly, I should, but there is still a massive part of me that resists spending more than $20 on a product for skincare haha"
351,2020-02-05 04:12:02,eyxqoo,"There's USP and NSF certification you can look for! It's a little symbol on the label. A lot of Nature Made will have USP certification, for example. It's pretty frustrating to stand in the aisle for half an hour looking at labels, just to find a Vitamin D3 that's USP certified. I wish they would have mandatory certification for all supplements."
352,2020-02-05 01:48:25,eyxqoo,The Muerte palette disappoints me only because of the cluster of dark shades in the center of the palette. There just wasn’t enough variation in shade/tone. I think adding a a muted coral would have looked amazing with the other shades. The red and greens are gorgeous though.
353,2020-02-05 02:03:29,eyxqoo,Very true !
354,2020-02-05 11:55:36,eyxqoo,"This! I bought a few things (buying into hype, I guess) but the packaging is amazing, the colors seem well thought out, and they're unlike anything I have in my collection. 

A lot of people complain about price, but she is *Posh* Spice, after all."
355,2020-02-05 06:01:45,eyxqoo,"He's definitely super famous, but I'd recognize him as makeup brand turned celebrity than celebrity turned makeup brand"
356,2020-02-05 11:06:14,eyxqoo,Jeffree Star is also complete and utter trash.
357,2020-02-05 12:45:58,eyxqoo,"Why are you being downvoted for this?!

I dont understand reddit sometimes."
358,2020-02-05 11:54:19,eyxqoo,"I'm pretty sure it's all vegan. And it's bloody amazing! I love Jeffree, but I wish I had more money to buy his products. But his eyeshadows and lipsticks are out of this world!"
359,2020-02-05 04:32:33,eyxqoo,Omg seriously I need these now!!!
360,2020-02-05 08:20:59,eyxqoo,"Exactly, it was really great and you can see her passion for the brand. She isn't as known for bright multicoloured make-up looks as someone like Jeffree Star is, in fact a lot if the time her make-up is very classic, sometimes with a slight twist."
361,2020-02-06 07:07:54,eyxqoo,"Yeah, Keshas is very unique and I love it haha. I was referring more to lady gaga and mbbs palettes and such. Also Id like to add, I think selenas line isnt a cash grab because shes been working on it for so long (since before the celeb makeup line trend) and hired professionals in the field."
362,2020-02-05 06:16:54,eyxqoo,"Every time you get into a hobby, it’s the same. At first I was lost in the make-up world too, two years later, I can rec products to anyone. However, I’m getting into skincare and I feel overwhelmed again lol. Never ending circle, with so much to learn."
363,2020-02-05 05:43:09,eyxqoo,"Honestly? Ipsy bag or other makeup service. $10 for the sample bag, $25 for the big one. Lots of things to test and play with! 

You can budget easily and if you find something you really like, you can go out and buy it!"
364,2020-02-05 00:19:43,eyxqoo,"If I recall correctly, Jackie Aina reviewed them and they were okay but WAY overpriced, especially for a teen audience."
365,2020-02-05 00:22:14,eyxqoo,"Unless you work in the field of skincare, I don't care for your skincare line. Especially for a 16 year, who probably doesn't even use her own skincare line. Reminds me of Kylie Jenner too...."
366,2020-02-05 04:36:52,eyxqoo,I like the idea of Colourpop’s magnetic pallets that fit individual refill pans. You don’t have to buy a whole new palette when you pan one single shadow.
367,2020-02-05 08:51:50,eyxqoo,Kjaer Weiss does the refill thing. Almost everything is in a pan as far as I can remember. It's quite expensive and I haven't tried it but I know they're at least one doing it.
368,2020-02-05 05:26:23,eyxqoo,"I don't think it can go in with your average single stream recycling but a few companies offer recycling programs - Bare Minerals, Origins stores/counters and I'm pretty sure Back to Mac gets recycled."
369,2020-02-05 04:05:29,eyxqoo,"Ha, it used to be perfume.

Although I love gaga's liquid eyeshadows 🙃"
370,2020-02-05 05:04:37,eyxqoo,Perfume?
371,2020-02-05 01:55:32,eyxqoo,"I""m glad there's not a coral simply because coral looks terrible on me (I can't do anything that has the slightest hint of warm tones).  I took a hard pass on Vida because it's pretty much all warm.  They have a new one coming out that does have a coral in it (I like it, I will swatch it, but I can probably dupe it within my collection.

I will also typically use more than one palette to do a look so not having everything doesn't bother me. 

Normally a shade or 2 that doesn't work for me doesn't bother me.  But for a $58 palette, I want to be able to use all the shades.  For a $7 Primark palette, not so much."
372,2020-02-05 11:53:07,eyxqoo,He was actually quite famous back in the day with his music. But I would say he rediscovered fame after he started up his makeup line.
373,2020-02-05 11:25:23,eyxqoo,I guess I don't understand the down votes and why why he's trash. My SIL buys nothing but JS and we love it. What makes him or it so trashy?
374,2020-02-05 13:23:02,eyxqoo,"More about the general sentiment towards him than his product, I'd guess."
375,2020-02-05 07:18:15,eyxqoo,"You can recycle beauty, skincare, and haircare empties from any brand at l’Occitane boutiques (and they’ll give you 10% off one item) 😊"
376,2020-02-05 04:50:51,eyxqoo,"You're so right about that. I was never super into fragrance so I don't know much about what's out there, but I feel like I see lots of celebrity-branded perfume on sale all the time. Lots of these products aren't even bad per se; there's too many of them, though! I can't keep up. Just wish there was more imagination lately 😔"
377,2020-02-05 10:12:42,eyxqoo,"Shit, you just made me realize that makeup palettes are the old celeb fragrances!

Disclaimer before you read any further: I'm a passive observer of the makeup industry. This means that I may be wrong about some points and I understand completely if you choose to point them out to me.

But why is it that everyone release the same product? If someone comes out with fragrance, another should bring out a makeup palette, another hair care, another skin care, another shoes, and so on. I mean, I get it - celebs are competing against each other for mindshare, but:

1) if I buy A's makeup, my chances of buying B's makeup are going to be lesser. Maybe I'm a makeup fiend, so I do buy both. But then I'll buy everyone else's as well. I won't be loyal to just one celeb's product so I won't be likely to recommend one over the other.

2) if different celebs bring out different products, people are more likely to buy them all more just because we need more products in different categories than more in the same category.

3) are the colors of different makeup palettes REALLY that different? Here is where my ignorance may shine through. But this is a question that pops into my mind every time an influencer comes out with a palette. I think, ""How many blue eyeshadows do I need in my life?"" At this point, someone may point out the famous ""Cerulean Blue"" dialogue from Devil Wears Prada. But I still don't understand it as much as I would like to. 

3a) If you say the quality may differ, I would say this: someone who has the financial resources that a Selena or a Lady Gaga has would not compromise on quality. Jaclyn can compromise because she is not a world-renown celeb. Her reach is limited to her YouTube and Instagram followers and people in the makeup field. It may be a huge pool of people, but definitely not as large as the kind of pool of fans that these celebs have. If they mess up, it's going to be all over the news and a PR nightmare, since it could be dangerous, health-wise."
378,2020-02-06 20:20:35,eyxqoo,I would massively disagree. He was medium famous in a very niche subculture.

380,2020-02-06 06:32:47,eyxqoo,"Oh that's helpful because Bare Minerals & Origins I think are primarily for cosmetics & skincare, but not for haircare product packaging!"
381,2020-02-05 05:16:42,eyxqoo,"And celebrity perfumes all smell the same too! It's always the sweet, floral or vanilla or coconut scent. Not that it's bad, but like you said, I wished there was more variety and creativity instead of being an obvious cash-grab.


Sorta reminds me of that time when I read how Elizabeth Taylor would make perfumes that she herself would wear. There's a photo of her dressing table somewhere and she's got all her perfumes there. I thought that was pretty neat."

390,2020-02-04 20:20:59,eytn6v,Black Mamba = Kobe Bryant? He was born in 78
391,2020-02-06 09:29:29,eytn6v,"Everyone he names is from the ‘80s. 
Name of song is “Ball hard.” 

‘Balling like the 80’s’."
392,2020-02-07 19:20:01,eytn6v,Listen to his Apple Music interview he explains there is no reason why he just went in the studio and was messing around saying random names that rhymed
393,2020-07-16 06:16:27,eytn6v,Kareem abdul jabbar = retired 1989
394,2020-02-04 19:15:36,eytn6v,Yeah most likely it's connected to that. Otherwise the names are way too random
395,2020-02-04 21:33:41,eytn6v,Black Mamba Baby Mama is Vanessa Bryant who was born in 1982. People might say it's a reach but it lines up
396,2020-02-04 23:35:29,eytn6v,Could be. Black Mamba could just be to match the last name Bryant. Could be two separate terms. All I know is that the flow is sick as fuck
397,2020-02-05 04:56:57,eytn6v,I think it's 2 separate terms. B

399,2020-02-05 08:24:07,eyt38c,"There's another way to see this. The boy was saying to her ""come out and play"" while she had fallen down the stairs.

What if he was talking to the baby. And when she lost it (I'm so sorry to hear that)
the boy finally got the company he wanted and moved on."
400,2020-02-05 03:37:47,eyt38c,"Sorry for your loss, but can you politely explain to Ted that you don't exert unnecessary energy lugging kitchen boxes that are clearly labeled up a flight of stairs into theoffice?! Man, that drove me crazy Thewhole time I read this.
You dump theboxes off, if not in they're designated rooms thenat *least* on the correct *floor*!"
401,2020-02-04 19:30:58,eyt38c,That’s gutwretching op. Maybe he’ll come back if you get pregnant again.

After I lost him (I felt that it was a boy, I dont know for certain) at 10 weeks, I was devastated. I lost all hope for having children, I became depressive. 

But, after two months I was pregnant again with. my daughter. She is my everything, I love her more than anything.

It will pass sister, it will..."

414,2020-02-04 23:36:09,eyt38c,Question: What if the little boy was actually her pregnant kid?
415,2020-02-05 11:30:08,eyt38c,CTFDN so underrated
416,2020-02-06 15:24:15,eyt38c,jesus...but that kind of makes sense
417,2020-02-07 01:01:01,eyt38c,"I like your take on this, even if it's heartbreaking. What a sad wee story."
418,2020-02-19 22:43:03,eyt38c,Yeah but it's been hinted the boy looks like her father

420,2020-02-05 04:43:24,eyt38c,Probably won't. It would be another kid.

427,2020-03-28 16:35:09,fqm6d0,"Aquarius sun here, I've been dating a Pisces sun for nearly 5 years :)"
428,2020-03-29 02:42:56,fqm6d0,I am. Currently trying to cuff one 😂
429,2020-03-28 16:32:16,fqm6d0,Yes but I may be biased because I’m Aqua sun Pisces moon and my fiancé is Pisces sun Aqua rising. We are very similar and connect on a deeper level than I’ve ever experienced with anyone else! We could talk all day and get lost in intriguing conversations :) he is very complex and prompts me to look at things differently than I normally would which keeps my mind entertained
430,2020-03-28 18:41:43,fqm6d0,"Aqua sun with Scorpio moon, mars,  and Rising with a Pisces Venus. I love them, the eyes are what gets me and just their genuine caring nature! They always seem very sweet and patient. One girl I was into over the summer was a Pisces and the dude I really want to date is one as well and they happen to have cancerian aspects.

I wonder why though, considering with how dETaCheD Aquarians are, like why that is lmao"
431,2020-03-28 20:59:08,fqm6d0,"My mom is a Pisces with some Aqua. I'm an aqua with some Pisces. Her and I are best friends when it comes to spirituality, sustainability, loving the earth, arts, expression, love of truth, philosophy, and humor.

When emotions come into play, I feel she imposes her feelings as reality. She feels like I'm not truly committed to our relationship. I don't feel I can be completely honest about her behaviors and their negative impact or she'll take it personal and catastrophize. She feels she can't be honest with me or I'll ghost her. 

Sometimes I get annoyed with Pisces (students of mine, lovers, friends, etc) because they're so emotional and live in this cagey, victim mentality based space. Say the wrong thing and they're ready to throw themselves off a building saying ""look at what you did."" 

They're fun to create with, though."
432,2020-03-28 21:22:15,fqm6d0,"Most of my closest friends, and my two BFF are Pisces."
433,2020-03-29 01:33:02,fqm6d0,I'm an Aquarius who has been with a Pisces for almost 3 years now
434,2020-03-28 17:12:41,fqm6d0,Yes! I have had many rollercoaster relationships with Pisces! I'm currently engaged to one but my venus and mars are in Pisces so that's probably why. It's mainly romantic I'm rarely friends with Pisces
435,2020-03-28 17:47:58,fqm6d0,"I have my Venus in Pisces, I also have my Juno and Vesta in Pisces and Pisces rules my 5th house. I absolutely love Pisces (though not in a romantic way, I think we’re too incompatible in romance) and I’ve known a lot and they are the most generous people I’ve ever met. The way they care about those who are closest to them is absolutely admirable, and I appreciate all the Pisces friends I have in my life. I have an Aquarius stellium (sun, moon, mercury, uranus and neptune) so that’s why I’m not compatible with them in relationships, they’re a lot more affectionate and romantic than I’m comfortable with. But they make great friends and they’re in my top 5 favorite signs."
436,2020-03-28 22:47:40,fqm6d0,Nope
437,2020-03-28 19:57:09,fqm6d0,Not an Aquarian but fellow Saturn brethren here and I freaking adore Pisceans. They're so sensitive and dreamy. I just wanna be a rock for them. Winter signs gotta stick together.
438,2020-03-28 19:59:00,fqm6d0,"My dad was a pisces. He was a great guy. I get along with them very well. My former roommate was a pisces. He was a great guy. 

I'm a lesbian, also.  My wife is a Libra (so is my ex wife). I have a lot in pisces and in libra. https://www.reddit.com/r/aquarius/comments/fpp1zv/spot_on_i_experienced_great_loss_this_past_year/

One of my exes is an Aries. 

I've dated Scorpios and other Aquariuses."
439,2020-03-29 02:43:23,fqm6d0,"my mercury is in pisces, all of my best friends have been pisces!"
440,2020-03-29 02:56:05,fqm6d0,"I'm an Aqua sun, Virgo Moon and Taurus rising and I adore them!! My current bf is actually a Pisces sun, Taurus Moon and Aqua rising.
I absolutely adore him! We have similar music tastes and we just get along great, alot of people say there will be problems in sex but I've yet to come across any!"
441,2020-03-29 03:23:37,fqm6d0,"I LOVE PISCESC SO MUCH!! Maybe because I’m very influenced by the pisces in my chart? 29 degree jupiter in pisces, venus in pisces....... but I do love them. they really fit the “ethereal” vibe in ~cliche~ astrology... <3"
442,2020-03-29 08:26:48,fqm6d0,"Pisces being the only sign later in the zodiac than aquarians definitely adds to our fascination... they can understand the really big conceptual ideas that our minds wander too and take it even one step further out there a lot of the time. Also, if you look into sidereal astrology, many pisces are aquarians in sidereal, and we all know how much aquas love other aquas 🤩"
443,2020-03-29 14:47:43,fqm6d0,"Yeah I love pisces a lot.  I have a lot of pisces in my chart and i’m a cusper, born on Feb 18. I mostly just feel like I understand them a lot, because I almost am one lol. I relate heavily to both Aquarius and Pisces traits."
444,2020-03-29 17:48:23,fqm6d0,"I love Pisces, they are soo deep and they really compliment us aquas."
445,2020-03-29 18:18:44,fqm6d0,"Love them as friends I have really good chill vibes w them for the most part, I’ve been attracted to a few but it never has worked out amazingly for me, sometimes, SOMETIMES, it really was like dating a different person. I prefer to stay as friends, but that’s just the Aquarius in me always just tryna be friends before dating. 

My moms a Pisces and she’s the fucking worst"
446,2020-03-29 20:45:47,fqm6d0,"Honestly, on paper, Pisces and Libras were the first signs that sounded attractive to me.

MAYBE because that... For Pisces at least, my Venus and Mars sign is Capricorn"
447,2020-03-28 18:34:31,fqm6d0,Hmmm scorpios scare me
448,2020-03-31 10:52:49,fqm6d0,I very much dislike scorpio.. I have a south node in Virgo which means they are attracted to me and tend to always want to be friends. I don’t like the dark energy of a Scorpio.
449,2020-03-28 18:35:17,fqm6d0,Amazing! How is it going? Especially the whole emotional side of it? :)
450,2020-03-29 09:27:55,fqm6d0,How's that working out for you? haha
451,2020-03-28 18:42:41,fqm6d0,Thanks for replying :)  I would honestly love to have some pisces in my chart lol. I find the same with any pisces I meet! Can literally talk about anything and its the most interesting conversation. Maybe that's why I like them so much because they are able to connect with me deeper than any other sign which is something I need. Wish you guys an amazing life filled with love <3
452,2020-03-28 18:48:53,fqm6d0,">Oh my god their eyes are mesmerising!! I love how much they care as well :') Sometimes I think maybe Im so attracted to them because I wish I could express my emotions as they do and not bottle them up all the time.....but it has to be more than that haha... and then sometimes I think maybe I just like the idea of them? and then I get scared that if I actually date a pisces that I won't be able to handle their emotional side.  Im not sure how I feel about cancers I only know a few including my twin sisters and they annoy me hahah but one of my best friends is a cancer too.  
>  
>It's weird I can't stop thinking about it now and need to get to the bottom of it hahah"
453,2020-03-29 18:24:01,fqm6d0,"Omg finally someone who can relate to having a crazy Pisces mom, the biggest issues for us are respect for each other, and there’s lots of tension."
454,2020-03-29 09:28:11,fqm6d0,Oh unreal how's it going? :)
455,2020-03-28 18:36:35,fqm6d0,Awh cute hope you have an amazing life together :) I don't think I have any pisces in my chart its so weird!
456,2020-03-28 18:39:47,fqm6d0,Thanks for the response :) They make amazing friends they're always there for advice and everything! See in my head I want a really affectionate/romantic relationship but I feel like my Aquarius placements always get in the way of expressing those feelings! What sign are you most attracted to with an Aquarius stellium?
457,2020-03-29 09:35:57,fqm6d0,Im gonna go check my chart to make sure I don't have any pisces. I don't have any pisces friends really! I did in the past but im mainly physically/ romantically attracted to them for some reason
458,2020-03-29 09:30:53,fqm6d0,so dreamy lol
459,2020-03-29 09:30:38,fqm6d0,">I don't really get on that well with other Aquarius suns to be honest, I find we always have a different of opinion..probably because my sister is an Aquarius though"
460,2020-03-29 00:39:53,fqm6d0,"Often, we get along very well! We are extremely compatible deeper in our charts. Majority of our conflicts is emotionally related, though, as expected."
461,2020-03-29 11:07:38,fqm6d0,Lmaoo it’s not 🥺
462,2020-05-12 02:29:06,fqm6d0,update: Pisces are flighty mfers but cool I guess.
463,2020-03-29 13:18:37,fqm6d0,"It's great! We're actually expecting our first child together in May. 
I find he helps me get in tune with my emotions and how to vocalize them. I help him rationalize his feelings"
464,2020-03-28 21:15:23,fqm6d0,"I have a thing for fire signs, especially Sagittarius and Aries. I’ve also had things for other Aquarians, but it’s never as exciting as it is with a fire sign. I have liked some Gemini’s also but only if they have a fire moon. I don’t really like serious relationships and I like to keep things light hearted so I feel like that may be why I’m attracted to those signs. Sometimes my Pisces venus makes me think I want a serious romantic relationship, but I find that I’m more in love with the idea of love rather than love itself. So yeah it’s better to keep things lighthearted and I never really get into serious relationships."

🛳 *TURISMO* ✈ 
🎒 *Conheça Praia do Espelho-BA:* Um dos destinos mais visitados na alta temporada na Bahia tem nome: Praia do Espelho. O nome sugestivo é facilmente explicado. Antes chamada de Coruípe, a praia mudou de nome por abrigar águas tão claras que mais parecem espelhos refletindo paisagens paradisíacas. As outras praias do entorno tão lindas quanto Espelho são: Setiquara, Outeiro, Jacumã e dos Amores, acessíveis a partir de caminhadas na maré baixa. O clima bucólico fica evidente na areia das praias em que não se encontra sequer uma cadeira de plástico. As barracas dispõem caprichosamente de espreguiçadeiras com almofadas e esteiras sobre a areia trazendo o máximo de conforto aos visitantes. Alguns mirantes acima das falésias revelam exuberâncias. Alguns passeios de barco partindo da Praia do Espelho estão entre opções divertidas em direção ao Rio dos Frades, Trancoso, Caraíva e Corumbau. As pousadas são como uma extensão das praias, pois oferecem tanta tranquilidade, conforto e belezas quanto as paisagens litorâneas. Além da vista que descortina o mar, os quartos são equipados com tecnologia de ponta, camas espaçosas, ambientes arejados ao ar livre com espaço para gazebos e redes, piscinas e algumas com hidromassagem. Algumas abrigam quadra de esportes e salão de jogos. Assim, as noites de lazer são garantidas. Ao anoitecer as velas são acesas e um espaço para jantar ao ar livre é preparado. A fartura de pratos gastronômicos e carregados de sabores é garantido. Se quiser mais agitação procure algumas barracas de praia que, vez ou outra, tocam música ao vivo e também servem deliciosos pratos regionais. Muitos turistas optam por fazer um bate volta de Trancoso, devido aos altos preços. Porém, nada como passar uns dias desfrutando da paisagem. *Fonte: Guia Viagens Brasil*

As for the song, I think her voice suits the chorus quite well. The song is a bit slower than I might have expected, but the second half of the second verses where's there a little beat change (at ""Tell me you love me"") is really quite good. Overall, a nice chill song that I would put on while smoking or hanging with friends (over Zoom :/)"

586,2020-04-20 18:30:58,g4wrbp,"Tbf his Rihanna collabs, while has it's shitty moments, aren't nearly as insufferable as his work with Skyler grey, Jessie Reyez or Pink. LOYALTY. is a good track but I doubt that Em's delivery would mingle well with the instrumental given that even Kendrick ended up sounding so monotonous there."
587,2020-04-20 17:28:42,g4wrbp,I like LTWYL much more than LOYALTY tbh.  I don't care too much about The Monster. I think the chemistry between Kenny and Rihanna is nice on LOYALTY but overall we've had more than enough of Eminem trying to make pop hits with singers. Especially when he tries to sing too. So I personally want to see no more of that stuff.
588,2020-04-20 17:16:09,g4wrbp,"I just don’t think Em’s voice mixes well with most female singers anymore except for singers like Sia or Jessie. His voice is just way to loud and aggressive, it’s in complete contrast to most singers’ voices."

688,2020-05-02 13:19:29,gc64em,"I’d say 80s pop paved the way for so many artists. And the superstars back then were mostly able to play instruments and produce their own shit

90s was more concerned about one-hit-wonders, street rap, R&B fads and big belters filling AC radio. I don’t know if the mid-90s had any „pure pop“ songs like the mid-80s.

2000s was the decade I was a kid and That’s why this decade will always have a special place in my heart. Also the superstars of that decade were fun to watch and stan. 

2010s started out promising, but I noticed that after 2016 the fun left the charts. Funnily, this was also the year things got more serious for me personally and I had to face adult problems and shit."

The 70s had ABBA, David Bowie, Elton John, Donna Summer etc"
691,2020-05-02 13:40:46,gc64em,I would’ve voted for the 10s if music hadn’t pivoted towards RnB and trap music in the later years of the decade. Everything started sounding dull and the same. The 2000s will forever have my heart.

693,2020-05-02 13:16:37,gc64em,I voted 10's... then again 10's pop wouldn't be what it is without 80's & 90's pop. 🍾

695,2020-05-02 13:28:02,gc64em,Make a good point but I think here people think of the 80s as what started the mainstream pop sound we have now.
696,2020-05-02 13:31:00,gc64em,The bass and kickdrums didn’t slap. Miss me with that music pre programmed drums and synths
697,2020-05-02 13:47:53,gc64em,"Trap music has gotten a little old. It's either trap, hip hop, R&B, or synth-pop this last decade."
698,2020-05-02 12:43:42,gc4d8a,"I met a girl, talked via text and FaceTime. Then had her over for dinner. It couldn’t have been a better experience."
699,2020-05-02 20:28:25,gc4d8a,"She’s an ICU nurse working in the COVID unit. We matched in March. She didn’t want to meet up until the pandemic was over because she didn’t want to put me at risk, so we had a zoom date and it went well. During this time, I also met someone else who I connected with a lot, but after talking to her, we both realized that dating without meeting was pointless and said bye and that we’d reach out after the lockdown ended. So I stopped swiping on hinge and only maintained convo with the nurse. 

Slow and steady works. The cadence of our texts picked up from a handful of slow exchange to a more rapid barrage. She doesn’t use her phone much- no social media, and she was replying within 30 min - an hour on her days off. She told me last week she hung out with her best friend at a park. Obviously a huge hint for me to ask her out, so I did and she said yes. We have a second date planned for the near future. 

I have a feeling I’m going to marry her."
700,2020-05-02 11:37:55,gc4d8a,"I’m definitely talking to one of the sweetest guys I’ve ever met on any of the platforms. We’ve only been texting for about three weeks, but plan to meet up next week. I have a really good feeling about him. I’ve had good feelings before, I’ve been infatuated, I’ve been EXCITED, I’ve been scared. This just is.. smooth and intelligent convo with a guy who really seems like he cares. 

This is online dating as a 30something though, so I’m sure there will be baggage. 90% of us have it by now and the other 10% is lying about it lol.

I don’t believe in soul mates, but that’s just a personal, spiritual belief of mine."
701,2020-05-02 13:30:58,gc4d8a,"I built a happy relationship thanks to Hinge, WhatsApp, Zoom, and being smart about how/when to meet. The main idea is to keep moving forward."
702,2020-05-02 15:09:38,gc4d8a,"I (28m) feel the same! I’m three really nice video calls in with a girl who initiated the hinge convo and the first date (amazing). Trying not to get my hopes up too much because we’re still both in completely different parts of the country for now and her response rate is a little slow, but I’m hopeful.

That said, I also got stood up on a zoom date by a different girl earlier on. Some things don’t change under quarantine 

Good luck out there"

If that is mom behind him, she has all her settings down as small as possible, so it passed on to her son. Gotta put some muscle on the women.  They look anorexic without muscles anyway."

What’s *objective* however is how overplayed he is on radio stations."
805,2020-06-30 15:30:11,hiovf5,"Most anti-Drake people (even if they won't say it) are not against his music - they're against his writing style. Almost every hip-hop artist collaborates with other people, even if it's just as simple as having a beat provided to them to rap over. However, there is a limit at which your assistance has gone ""too far"" to view you as someone who actually wrote it. 

For example, if you hand me the beat, the lyrics and put a microphone in front of me and say ""read this"" - did I write the song? I would say no... but a lot of Drake's biggest hits were done that way. He goes into the studio with 10+ people and everyone throws ideas around until something sounds good but by the time the song is created, the effort he put into the song was very minimal. 

Compare him to Dr. Dre who goes into the studio, writes the beat, records the beat, writes the lyrics, records the lyrics, produces the song, tweaks the song and then releases the song. Some people want to put Drake at the same level as Dre. That's like saying a 5th generation trust-fund millionaire should be held at the same level as Elon Musk."
806,2020-06-30 14:58:07,hiovf5,Yeah he has a lot of great songs but he just rarely releases good full bodies of work. Honestly I think his last good album was if your reading this. Scorpion for instance was dogshit.
807,2020-06-30 14:58:45,hiovf5,That's why his songs are played billions of times
808,2020-06-30 15:34:09,hiovf5,"It’s not that drake’s music is bad so much that it’s drake. His early work was a lot better than now, tbh, but he suffered from the fact that he was definitely a wannabe gangster while making bitch made songs. Hence [Drake the typa n****](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTsQtXJGUVXadgJv8xPcWjTPGw8lghtaPvwxA&usqp=CAU) meme. Then his music evolved to basically doing whatever to generate content. And while it’s essentially what every artist tries to do, they generally try to make a music that are hit songs. Drake does the reverse; tries to make hit songs into music at this point. And while it’s somewhat unrelated, it does relate to his sports fandom. He’s the dude that bandwagons every team that’s winning instead of actually liking a team. That translates into music because he’s just doing what’s popular rather than supporting, or standing for, anything. And I think that’s where he gets a lot of hate"
809,2020-06-30 15:49:19,hiovf5,Um actually I'm anti-drake because he is suspicious af and I think he may be a pedophile ✌🏻
810,2020-06-30 15:58:09,hiovf5,Not sure about that one but that certainly doesn't help my opinion of him.
811,2020-06-30 16:00:35,hiovf5,"1. He's proven to be friends and hang around a human trafficker 
2. His conversations and closeness with Milly Bobby Brown (then 16 I believe when this info came out) made public was very concerning and creepy coming from a guy over 30 wanting to hang out with a teen and talk to her personally."

exec tell me that albums aren’t a thing anymore. As much as I still adore listening to albums start to finish, I get it. People don’t have the attention span for full albums anymore. We live in a world where singles garner the most success. 

I always refer back to Miley’s Party In The USA. The song was such a huge hit and it was co-penned by Jessie J. She talked about how the royalties from that song paid for her NYC apartment for 6 fucking years. To me, a hate the cliche that the artist singing the song gets all the attention. The writers are the ones that make the big bucks off these songs."

899,2020-06-30 02:53:05,hi7c53,"Wow hard relate to this post! This was a big part of me figuring out my gender identity. I've always loved pop music from all decades and had to repress a lot of that love to try to fit in as a man. I've been listening to so much femme pop lately and it makes me feel so liberated and myself. I still like some more masculine music but on the whole I think my music taste is more ""feminine"" (whatever that means) and it feels good to admit that.  My music taste is a lot more diverse now. Kim Petras Malibu video was what made me finally admit to myself that I'm trans and that's song of the year for sure!"
900,2020-06-30 08:11:17,hi7c53,"Yeah, this was totally my experience. I always loved pop songs by women but to a pretty big extent was ''ashamed'' of admitting it to the wider world. The degree to which depended on the song.  Embracing that love has been great."

905,2020-06-29 20:41:12,hi7c53,"That statement itself is even more.. tone deaf and frankly far more insidiously racist than just not liking pop music but that’s an entirely different conversation from the one we’re having.

Black people being a foundation of most, if not all, music genres, pop music is purely based on what is attractive; The aesthetics. Black ideals are attractive but not black skin.

What you’ve said is “I like gangsta rap” as a contrast to pop music, othering black people before any context is given is at the very least is.. really fuckin strange and at worst, sparks red flags that as black person I would avoid talking to you just based on that."
906,2020-06-30 04:42:13,hi7c53,"despite your explanation here, I’m still having trouble understanding how avoiding pop music is racist. there are many people who don’t like pop music for different reasons. could you please provide a concrete example as to how disliking pop is racist?"
907,2020-06-29 20:46:25,hi7c53,"Okay, outside of rap, I also like Nat King Cole, Chuck Berry, Jimi Hendrix, Fishbone, Sevendust, Bad Brains, and Body Count.

If you want to insinuate I'm racist, then you don't know what the word means. 🙄🤷"
908,2020-06-29 20:47:42,hi7c53,"Oh yes, please white girl with blonde hair and blue eyes, tell me what racism is because apparently my black ass just doesn’t know when I’m being micro-aggressed by overly defensive whites over the internet. Please. Give your thoughts on what makes up racism. I’m sure it’s very compelling. 

News flash: all white people, whether they’re actively trying to or not, contribute to racism. Someone saying you’re racist is at the least an objective observation and at the worst someone telling you to shut the fuck up when you’re speaking on stuff you don’t understand, have the resources to study, but just choose not to."

916,2020-06-29 20:11:34,hi640b,"1. I think I'd go with Dre, but that's tough.
2. Neptunes beat Kanye, but I think Kanye would beat Pharrell
3. I'm inclined to say Trackmasters
4. Just Blaze has more hits.  This is a battle where I may think Alchemist's beats are actually better, but if the goal is getting a reaction out of the crowd, JB wins.

&#x200B;

1. I'd go with Jay, although if Wayne is playing songs he's featured on it becomes much harder (especially if he plays Bling Bling and Back Dat Azz Up).  If Wayne can use mixtape songs I'd give him a slight edge, especially since he could play his freestyles over some of Jay's beats.
2. Beyonce.  This is one where I think a shorter number of rounds would have helped Usher.
3. Rihanna SLAUGHTERS him
4. Gonna pass on this one, I'm not familiar enough with their mixtapes
5. If its 10-15 rounds I'd lean slightly toward Missy, if its longer I'd go Busta, as he has some classic features he could play (Scenario, Look At Me Now..) 
6. T Pain 
7. Damn that's tough.. I'm probably gonna lean toward LL if we're just going off songs from their projects, but if Q-Tip can play songs he produced I'd give him a slight edge"

919,2020-06-30 16:39:24,hi640b,And Jay z would destroy Lil Wayne. Love Wayne but Jay is in another category bro.
920,2020-06-30 23:16:11,hi640b,Could careless about hits.  Jay had more hits than Wayne anyway. Bar for bar Jays wordplay is impeccable bro. Come on.
921,2020-06-30 23:17:02,hi640b,Alchemist destroys all of that with The Realist. Mobb Deep Murda Muzik

3. Rihanna SLAUGHTERS him

Usher had a rock solid 30. But I guess some of his super pop/EDM type songs don't fit in a battle vs Beyonce so maybe 25 is better 

I have Rihanna winning but NO ONE is slaughtering Bruno Mars' 20. I would suggest you take a look at his discography"
926,2020-08-14 16:24:46,hi640b,Alot of people don't realize Pharrell's run as an elite solo producer didn't start until 2012

928,2020-06-30 05:49:55,hi640b,I don't think they are a good match musically different eras and different kinds of music. I think They match up better with Bruno Mars and Usher
929,2020-06-30 17:05:02,hi640b,"How? Jay has monster hits with Beyonce and Pharrell, Wayne cancels it out with his monster hits with Drake and Chris Brown. At some point you get to the real hip-hop solo hits and Wayne has a significant advantage there

Put you money where your mouth is make Jay's 40."
930,2020-06-30 23:32:22,hi640b,"Lol this post makes no sense? 

Wayne has way more hit songs than Jay. And Wayne is the one known for wordplay not Jay Z"
931,2020-07-01 03:03:38,hi640b,Theres no opinion. Its a fact Wayne has more hit songs than Jay Z and any rapper ever(although Drake will surpass him soon)
932,2020-07-11 01:34:48,hi640b,Please give me your Jay Z 40
933,2020-06-30 16:38:44,hi640b,Lmao do you even know his catalogue? Or are you not a NY Hip Hop Head?
934,2020-06-30 16:40:16,hi640b,I like all those songs but outside of maybe John they aren't big enough hits to make the list
935,2020-06-30 17:14:19,hi640b,"I do, so there's no need to get defensive. I simply find JB's resume more impressive:

Exhibit C, Breathe, Allure (Remix), PSA, Oh Boy, U Don't Know, The Dynasty Intro, I Really Mean It, Church For Thugs, Lord Knows, The Storm (Remix), Exhibit A, Song Cry, The Roc (Just Fire), Touch the Sky, Welcome to New York City, Come On Baby, Return of the Hustle...

Also, why does it matter whether I'm a N.Y. hip hop head or not?"

938,2020-06-29 16:22:26,hi2vau,The resemblance is uncanny
939,2020-07-11 04:28:19,hi2sr7,the shoes she wore with the grey pants are actually Yeezy's
940,2020-06-29 16:53:55,hi2sr7,"I honestly didn't like Zico's song-it was my least favourite from the album.

Loved the DPR collab and his lyrics made me smile-also liked that it sounded like MMMs earlier songs.

Honestly not sure if that bit was meant to be Latin or Italian-her mv already had references to Malèna."
941,2020-07-11 14:14:39,hi2sr7,Thank you for that info I feel oddly at peace 😊
942,2020-06-29 17:00:02,hi2sr7,"I get the Zico song was either loved or just not loved. It's pretty experimental so it really isn't everyone's cup of tea.


By latin I meant the sound was latin pop inspired but you must definitely be right about the Italian thing . I don't know about the Malèna reference."
943,2020-06-29 17:10:55,hi2sr7,"It's Hwasa's favourite movie and the scene where there are multiple people trying to light up her cigarette is a direct reference to [this](https://youtu.be/zkBkTx-GL8s?t=121)(also worth noting that it's an mv about a woman that was hated just bcs she was considered too beautifull and provocative)

My main issue with the song beside sounding messy is that Bad guy similarity-it's a bit overused now tbh."
944,2020-06-29 17:19:40,hi2sr7,"Ooh I had no idea. I'll check it out that is very interesting.


Personally I didn't hear anything bad guy like except that there are switch ups ( which I'm a fan of). It felt like Bermuda triangle or Dystopia vibes. But yeah it's random and not everyone would like it ."
945,2020-06-29 17:25:47,hi2sr7,I honestly hear the similarity the moment guitar intro ends-around 30sec in but that might be just me.

She found a different shade of lipstick on his knuckles."

Rihanna is the lowest of the low in my book. She starts releasing songs about how she likes it rough and such, as soon as our man brown shows her rough inbetween the sheets she screames abuse. Bitch, if you dont like it tell him, his career as a public figure is not your publicity stunt. 

I try not to let scandles and bad decisions ruin my enjoyment of popular artists, I can even forgive alegid kiddy diddlers; Rihanna is lower than America hating dixy chicks in my book. Cant even think of her with out getting this angry!"

Big Dolly Parton hair like an 80s prom queen

I gave her a lift back to her crib cause her car wouldn't start.

991,2020-08-19 19:54:49,icuzc4,Omg this pic is amazing. I would that arsehol of hers
992,2020-08-20 04:36:37,icuzc4,I'd cum deep in her from behind
993,2020-08-19 20:30:31,icuzc4,Holy shit
994,2020-08-20 02:03:48,icuzc4,"Just wanna fuck her in that position....ass up,head down."
995,2020-08-19 20:01:39,icunys,"One of the big Adele songs such as “Rolling in the Deep” or “Hello” are likely contenders to be remembered for years. One of Katy’s songs might be remembered as well. Bieber might have one, too. Drake’s “One Dance” and The Chainsmokers’ “Closer” are possibles but both seem iffy. I don’t think long running hits such as “Old Town Road” or “Despacito” will be on anyone’s minds in a decade or so, though. Typically you need to have a massive song from a widely known artist (not a one hit wonder) to achieve classic status. Then again, a lot people remember “Macarena” even if they could not tell you the artist behind it."
996,2020-08-19 21:50:43,icunys,Call me maybe surely? Everyone remembers that song. Chandelier perhaps? That was everywhere too.
997,2020-08-20 00:52:53,icunys,Robyn's Dancing On My Own is already well on its way to becoming a classic.
998,2020-08-19 23:08:41,icunys,"I think the most important qualifier is, as you mentioned, ""songs that everyone knows."" Another important quality IMO is having a distinct intro, letting the nostalgia hit before anyone even sings a note. Which is to say: when this song comes on in the club in 20 years, you're going to be like ""OH SHIT."" I think it's possible for each artist to have more than one of these songs, but I think it's fun to consider the #1 song for iconic 10s artists.

I think my #1 pick would be ""We Found Love."" It's both a quintessential EDM-pop song and a quintessential Rihanna single. I fondly look forward to losing my shit to that intro for decades to come.

I'd go with ""Drunk in Love"" for Beyoncé, the sample in the intro is so iconic and distinctive. I remember so many people quoting the song endlessly too.

On that note, Tove Lo's looped ""oh oh""s from the beginning of ""Habits"" are instantly recognizable. It was also a song that everyone talking, it's not every day you have a pop song whose opening scene is a sex club.

""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"" strikes me as the Taylor Swift song most will remember, though there's a solid case to be made for ""Blank Space"" and ""Take It Off."" I think the latter 2 songs have more easily recognizable intros.

From the end of the decade, Billie Eilish's ""Bad Guy"" is a strong contender. The intro beat is so distinctive and it's not hard to imagine people in clubs shrieking ""DUH"" in 10 years.

Lana's impact on the decade is huge, but most casual listeners aren't going to know most of her songs. I might be biased because I'm not a huge fan of the Cedric Gervais remix, but I could see ""Young & Beautiful"" being the Lana song to define the 10s. It's the platonic ideal of a song for a millennial wedding reception, LOL.

Justin Bieber's ""Where Are Ü Now"" strikes me as the song most will remember from him. I distinctly remember multiple friends gushing about how much they loved that song despite previously hating him.

It's hard to say it would be anything else but ""Royals"" for Lorde, but I personally get way more amped when the piano in ""Green Light"" starts.

I think ""Shallow"" takes the cake for Gaga, but it's such an outlier from her sound in the first half of the decade. ""Bad Romance"" is the pick from electro-pop Gaga, that song has hooks for days (""rah rah ah ah ah,"" ""I DON'T WANNA BE FRIEEEEENDS"") and an intro that absolutely everyone knows.

For Miley, ""Wrecking Ball"" or ""Party in the USA"" (if it counts as 10s).

For Katy, my pick goes to ""Firework,"" not only because of the synth at the outset but also ""Do you ever feel / Like a plastic bag,"" which I've seen memed multiple times in the past couple of years.

Drake might be the hardest one to call since he had SO MANY HITS in the 10s, but ""Hotline Bling"" was a meme supernova, and I've already witnessed multiple times with people drunkenly shouting along to it in bars.

Not a Sheeran fan personally, but ""Shape of You"" has such a bopping intro, I can easily imagine it being ""that song"" for any number of casual fans.

I know within a second when ""Havana"" starts, and it's a pretty good example of the Latin pop that dominated the second half of the decade. I don't know anyone who likes that song as much as I do though so I may be biased.

It's hard to say with The Weeknd. I'd probably have to go with ""The Hills"" (*everyone* knows ""I only call her when it's half-past five"") though there's a case to be made for ""I Can't Feel My Face"" too.

There's also a bunch of songs that either became memes or were seen as ""gimmicky""/one-hit wonders that are great candidates: ""Call Me Maybe"" (unfortunately, since CRJ has so many better songs), ""Fancy,"" ""Old Town Road,"" ""Bad and Boujee,"" ""Black Beatles,"" ""Gangnam Style.""

I'm realizing I mostly thought about this in terms of ""the club"" but for the sake of my sanity I'll stop here, lmao.

EDIT: Any of Kesha's big singles from *Animal* qualify, I know the one the GP is most familiar with is ""TiK ToK"" but ""Your Love Is My Drug"" and ""Take It Off"" both have really killer intros. ""Take It Off"" particularly has that Vocodered ""There's a place in France"" sample that's totally killer. ""We R Who We R"" and ""Blow"" really cemented her as the champion of the pop singles game in the very beginning of the 10s too.

For Britney it's ""Till The World Ends,"" without question. For gays and girls and pop fans it might be ""Work Bitch"" but ""IF YOU FEEL IT LET IT HAPPEN"" has a power unlike any of her songs in that decade.

I feel like for Nicki it would be either ""Super Bass"" or ""Starships,"" but I would say ""Super Bass"" wins by a slight margin for being her first huge solo hit and the fact that non-EDM fans probably find ""Starships"" too much. (Her rap lyrics are also better on ""Super Bass."") Singing along with ""Super Bass"" is so much fucking fun, omg. ""Starships"" really is close behind though, as a pop bop it's top-notch.

Would also like to clarify my status in the 10s as a 20something white gay male living in the American South surrounded by friends who were either casual listeners of music in general (much less pop) or die-hard EDM fans, so my perspective is certainly colored by that."

1000,2020-08-19 20:24:17,icunys,"""Shallow"" was a massive hit in itself but it's going to really benefit from being tied to the movie which forms part of the four-film legacy of *A Star Is Born* (and from its links to Gaga's Oscar and Bradley). It also resonated with people as ""authentic"" and unique on the charts, and I think it'll be a karaoke/talent show/cover song staple for decades to come."
1001,2020-08-19 20:52:38,icunys,"Party Rock Anthem better become a classic, I feel like LMFAO were a staple in early 2010s popular culture. I think that song and video in particular will be a big source of nostalgia for a time that seemed a lot happier."
1002,2020-08-19 19:52:42,icunys,"This is such an interesting question because I really don't have an answer. I feel like music has gotten so fragmented as we move forward in time these big songs are going to happen less and less. At least in the mainstream.

One thing I've noticed in the past year or two, at punk shows is people singing along to the music in between sets. But at the same time it is only specific songs. It's stuff like The Black Parade, Dear Maria Count Me In, American Idiot. But at the same time you aren't going to get the general public singing to Dear Maria as this crowd of 1000 is."
1003,2020-08-20 00:46:11,icunys,"I can guarantee that We Found Love, Shake It Off, Uptown Funk, and Shape Of You will become classics. Adele will have at least one well-remembered song (I’m guessing either Rolling In The Deep or Someone Like You). Somebody That I Used To Know, Call Me Maybe and Closer will probably become classics as well. Drake, being the biggest artist of the decade, is basically guaranteed to have a classic song, but I don’t have a goddamn clue as to what song it would be. Also I feel like Party Rock Anthem will go the way of All-Star or Crank That where it’s well-remembered solely cuz it’s a meme"
1004,2020-08-19 21:07:36,icunys,"As other people have said, I believe Shallow will become a classic. As for Katy, I remember her singing California Gurls at the Superbowl and everyone knew the lyrics, so I think that one’s going to stay. Firework may become a classic too. Other random potential classics that come to mind are: We Found Love, Rolling In The Deep, Someone Like You, Call Me Maybe, Uptown Funk, Sorry, Blank Space, Shake It Off, Work, Thank U, Next, Bad Guy."

1007,2020-08-19 22:39:21,icunys,"Basically I’m thinking “what songs would be on a throwback playlist in 10-15 years?” Here’s my picks (lots of genre hopping here lol) : 

1. Act Up - City Girls. Whether or not they ever manage to find as much success as they did with this song, I don’t think there’s any denying that it’ll be played at parties and clubs foreverrrrrr. 

2. Dance Monkey - Tones & I. Yes I said it. Lmao. Hear me out, this is definitely going to be on some countdown “top 40 one hit wonders of the 2010s” 😂 I just feel like this song won’t be forgotten (no matter how much it should)

3. Wicked Games / The Hills / Starboy - The Weeknd. Idk, I feel like these are pretty self explanatory. 

4. Take Me To Church - Hozier. this is a song someone would put on their “born in the wrong generation” playlist in like 20 years ... not that I have one of those ..

5. New Rules - Dua Lipa. Yes this song will be on the “I just got broken up with and I need to feel like a bad bitch” playlist, along with Ariana Grande, rep era Taylor Swift, etc. 

6. No Tears Left To Cry - Ariana Grande. First of all the story behind this song is reason enough as to why it should and will be remembered. But really, it’s so good (also a part of the aforementioned breakup playlist lol)

I could keep going because I have so many “throwback” playlists of songs I consider to be classics from the 80s, 90s, 2000s, so its really fun for me to see what everyone songs else thinks could be the classics of the future. Love this post!"

1014,2020-08-19 23:42:04,icunys,"Switched on Pop just did an episode about which 90s songs are well known by Gen Z as compared to Millenials.  Very interesting listen.  I also played around on the website Defining the 90s Canon they based the episode on to test my knowledge by various decades (I'm an old Millenial aka Xenial).  I was only surprised by 1 out of the top 5 most recognized songs from the 90s.  

From the 2010s, most of these have been mentioned, but I would bet on:
Shake it Off, Uptown Funk, Someone Like You, Rolling in the Deep, Sorry, Shape of You or Thinking out Loud, What Makes You Beautiful (this might be my 1DAF showing), Take Me to Church, Old Town Road, 

I think that staying power depends on very wide pop culture appeal, nostalgia for those who lived it and appeal to kids who will hear it from their parents and in kid-friendly media."
1015,2020-08-19 21:46:28,icunys,"lol some of these songs people are mentioning I promise I've never heard in my life

I think Drunk in Love is a classic. Pretty sure everybody was getting laid the month it was released.

* Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites - Skrillex"
1017,2020-08-20 15:14:26,icunys,"I feel like different songs are remembered for different things. When I think of the quintessential 90s track, I have to think if I’m talking about grunge, hip-hop, bubblegum pop, etc. So I had to think of why a song would be remembered as part of the decade. I don’t think We Found Love will be as remembered for how big that it was, in fact (like someone mentioned) I think a lot of the biggest hits will be ignored in future years. I don’t think anyone is going to be remembering Old Town Road, Despacito, Shape of You, Happy, F\*\*k You, Gods Plan, See You Again, Closer, Blurred Lines, etc. 

&#x200B;

The songs that I think will end up being remembered would be like:

Teen pop staples: Call Me Maybe (Carly Rae Jepsen) & What Makes You Beautiful (One Direction)

The EDM jump starters: I Love It (Icona Pop) & Dancing On My Own (Robyn)

Cheerleader anthem: Shake It Off (Taylor Swift)

AC classics: Hello (Adele), Chandelier (Sia), Haven’t Met You Yet (Michael Buble), Diamonds (Rihanna)

The female rap renaissance: I Like It (Cardi B) & Super Bass (Nicki Minaj)

Songs that reached EVERY audience: Moves Like Jagger (Maroon 5), Uptown Funk (Bruno Mars), CANT STOP THE FEELING (Justin Timberlake)

Impact on culture: Alright (Kendrick Lamar), Royals (Lorde), Power (Kanye West), Video Games (Lana Del Rey)

Will end up being regarded as one of their bests in future years despite not being their highest peaks: no tears left to cry (Ariana Grande), The Edge of Glory/You & I (Lady Gaga), when the party’s over (Billie Eilish), Hands To Myself (Selena Gomez), Waka Waka (Shakira)

Wedding hits: Thinking Out Loud (Ed Sheeran) & All Of Me (John Legend)

Somebody that I used To Know
We Are Young
Pumped Up Kicks
Shake It Off
Uptown Funk
Someone Like You/Hello
Call Me Maybe
Royals"

1029,2020-08-20 18:22:07,icunys,"In my mind, some of the songs that will be representing the strain of pop indie that that briefly had a presence in the early tens are We Are Young and Some Nights by Fun., Somebody That I Used To Know by Gotye, Pumped Up Kicks by Foster the People, Animal and Everybody Talks by Neon Trees, Royals and Team by Lorde, Pompeii by Bastille, and the Summertime Sadness dance remix and possibly Young and Beautiful by Lana Del Rey, Little Talks by Of Monsters and Men, Sweater Weather by The Neighborhood, and the list goes on. Kind of a dude-heavy subgenre now that I think of it. I’d love to put Florence + the Machine on this list but Dog Days Are Over came out in 2009, and I don’t know if Shake It Out had a big enough impact in the GP to be a cultural marker."

Blank Space - Taylor Swift

Bad Guy, Bury A Friend - Billie Eilish

Poker Face, Bad Romance - Lady Gaga"
1032,2020-08-19 20:47:36,icunys,"Definitely Firework for Katy Perry, that's been used in so much film & TV, I think it's gonna stick around"
1033,2020-08-19 20:23:34,icunys,Definitely Someone Like you by Adele !
1034,2020-08-19 21:47:43,icunys,I think a lot of Adele songs will be remembered
1035,2020-08-19 23:45:13,icunys,"Sorry or Love Yourself for Bieber, depending on if people want the ballad or something upbeat. Alt option for Baby which I think was 2010? May be 09 though"
1036,2020-08-20 12:12:51,icunys,"Loads of one-hit wonders are extremely well-remembered, though I guess they're usually not considered *classics*. Nobody's going to forget Old Town Road.

Closer to me sounds *so* 2010s that I think it'll be iconic if mostly maligned rather than a classic."
1037,2020-08-20 07:09:44,icunys,"Adele will definitely have 3 or more. Katy maybe, the rest would honestly very much surprise me."
1038,2020-08-20 06:07:18,icunys,I think Chandelier is a strong contender considering how every season of every singing competition has at least one cover of it.
1039,2020-08-20 02:43:05,icunys,"I agree and I think the intro of the song really helps. I would say Work by Rihanna, Love on Top and Formation by Beyonce, and Sorry by Justin Bieber also fit"

1042,2020-08-20 22:00:45,icunys,You NAILED it. All great picks. For the weeknd I think Blinding Lights has potential too.
1043,2020-08-20 18:08:23,icunys,"I think for Katy, Teenage Dream or Roar can be also considered here."
1044,2020-08-20 16:24:15,icunys,"Def agree w hotline bling, it’s our eras low rider"
1045,2020-08-19 23:12:08,icunys,"it doesn't happen often, maybe once every few years, but there are rare moments when I hear a song for the first time and think ""oh I'm gonna be hearing that song for the rest of my life."" Uptown Funk is probably the biggest example of that. It just instantly hits you and fills you with music and dancing and I could just feel that it was going to be massive and live forever, as it deserves to.

The other song that I recall right off the top of my head feeling that way about was ""Here"" by Alessia Cara, which obviously didn't hit quite the same level as Uptown Funk but is still a really remarkable song."
1046,2020-08-20 12:21:44,icunys,"Those songs seem to me like maybe the biggest three of the decade, but I think it's interesting that musicially none of them really sound like the 2010s. I think they all could have come out at almost any time."
1047,2020-08-20 02:39:50,icunys,I really wish they pushed other songs from the soundtrack as singles like they would've had in the 80s and 90s. Always Remember Us This Way and I'll Never Love Again could've been big hits.

1051,2020-08-20 18:36:30,icunys,"Katy’s rollout for Teenage Dream will always be legendary to me. We got California Gurls, Teenage Dream, Firework, E.T., Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.), and The One That Got Away released as singles over a  15-month span, and I remember every one of those dropping. Katy owned 2010-2011. 

(Technically Hummingbird Heartbeat was released as a single in 2012 but because it came a lot later and didn’t really make an impact at the time, I left it out.)"
1052,2020-08-20 07:16:08,icunys,"I think Lucid Dreams will be remembered as the bigger emo trap classic, especially with Juice Wrld’s early death catapulting it"
1053,2020-08-20 12:15:45,icunys,"Yep, it's both pretty much the definitive song of a style that was huge, and the best song of that style. Definiitely feels like a classic to me."
1054,2020-08-20 07:22:16,icunys,Definitely would be in the 10s indie disco range. Could add M83 Midnight City to that list as well

1056,2020-08-19 20:18:29,icunys,"A lot of Drake’s songs fall under this category - Take Care, In My Feelings, Hotline Bling. Hate him or not, he undeniably makes hits (even though he’s not at his artistic peak anymore). Old Town Road, despite how overplayed it is, still sounds good.

And if we’re talking about songs released that aren’t that big but may become hits, I’m thinking of *EARFQUAKE*, Starboy, Thinkin’ Bout You"
1057,2020-08-19 21:18:30,icunys,Man I don't know half these songs right now let alone 10 years.

1063,2020-08-19 20:56:55,icunys,"Yeah, I agree.

I think Sunflower is possibly another contender in terms of potential classic too."
1064,2020-08-20 07:17:46,icunys,"I always thought the Posty song that could possibly last the longest in terms of classic status would be Congratulations, but I could see Rockstar or Better Now also being considered it too"
1065,2020-08-19 23:20:55,icunys,"My bet for a Post Malone song that could end up a classic is Better Now, though Rockstar is an excellent pick as well."

1067,2020-08-20 18:48:20,icunys,"I don’t know if Dancing On My Own or Video Games had a wide enough impact to be remembered as a touchstone for 2010s culture, at least in the GP."

1069,2020-08-20 07:13:40,icunys,Nice For What has already been mostly forgotten. Agree with Get Lucky tho.

Also saying she's not an icon felt unnecessary. (She's an icon already) ."
1074,2020-08-19 23:18:33,icunys,"For Taylor given that she has 2 songs from the 2000s that are likely classics (Love Story which is already seeing a resurgence thanks to TikTok, YBWM) and four potential classics from the 2010s (adding WANEGBT, IKYWT [meme]), I would say she has just as many songs that will be remembered/ ""classics"" as the likes of Katy Perry and Adele.

As for Ariana, I think Thank You, Next and 7 Rings will be ""classics"" way before NTLTC will be. Those two were much more in the GP's consciousness than NTLTC, in my opinion."
1075,2020-08-19 23:22:58,icunys,"I think Shake It Off, Blank Space, or even I Knew You Were Trouble probably have a better chance than Style at being the ""classic"" Taylor song."
1076,2020-08-20 00:31:31,icunys,Shake It Off is going to played at weddings until the end of time I think....
1077,2020-08-19 19:58:20,icunys,"> Video games 

I'm gonna refute this one; I was listening to NFR the other day and Video Games popped in my head, as in the song title, and I realized despite knowing the song pretty well I actually know none of the lyrics."
1078,2020-08-19 22:21:56,icunys,"Let me expose myself and my biases real quick by agreeing with you.  Lol

But really, It may not be the typical big smash hit that would be remembered for decades to come, but I think it’s in its own category of songs to be remembered. 

It may not get radio play, but if you were to play the song - most people (from my experience) know what it is and whose singing it. I think it’s going to certainly be remembered, as a beautiful ballad. (It was also named song of the decade by Q Magazine) So I’ll agree. ☺️"
1079,2020-08-20 01:09:34,icunys,"Firework by Katy perry already tracends her, it always has a comeback moment every 4th of July"
1080,2020-08-19 22:55:15,icunys,"tbh i was thinking of california girls, might be biased since thats my favorite song from the whole teenage dream era though"
1081,2020-08-20 00:06:21,icunys,"Sorry was one of the very best pop songs from the last decade, Top 5 easily. He's released a lot of forgettable garbage but Sorry is an exception as it's a great song."
1082,2020-08-20 03:53:54,icunys,"I'm not so sure. I love those two songs, but they're not very recognizable or stand out very well"
1083,2020-08-19 23:37:29,icunys,LMAO oop. Now I’m trying to imagine what TSwift covering Kesha’s “Take It Off” would sound like
1084,2020-08-20 22:25:12,icunys,"Really any of the *Teenage Dream* singles would work, considering how popular they all were. In my experience it seems like most people who like Katy Perry have a specific, resonating memory with at least one of those singles. (Personally, my favorite is ""The One That Got Away,"" but since that one was at the very end of that run I think most people would go with ""Teenage Dream,"" ""Firework,"" or ""California Gurls."")

Speaking anecdotally, ""Dark Horse"" over ""Roar"" seems like the *Prism* single with the most staying power. (I do say this as someone who mostly hangs out with EDM fans.) No slight against ""Roar"" but ""Dark Horse"" doesn't sound like anything else on *Prism* and it also hit #1, not to mention that chorus is such a wallop. By comparison ""This Is How We Do"" has aged horribly and I don't think most people know ""Unconditionally"" or ""Birthday."""
1085,2020-08-20 23:27:45,icunys,"I had the same feeling with Here. the right sample, with the right voice, at the right time... it should have been huge, and i don't quite understand why it wasn't"
1086,2020-08-20 07:49:02,icunys,"""Always"" went platinum in the US and got a main category Grammy nomination. It's the single that got away for her, and it's so frustrating they didn't push it. As soon as she pushed LG6 to late 2019 or further, she should have sent it to radio and let them clock up another smash for her."
1087,2020-08-20 15:31:49,icunys,"Before I Cry is my absolute favorite song from ASIB and I would’ve loved for it to be on radio, but it didn’t even show up in the film so nobody could really associate it with anything."
1088,2020-08-20 18:28:27,icunys,Like a G6 and Rocketeer (the radio version but especially the live acoustic version they did at Cherrytree) never fail to crack me up.

1098,2020-08-19 22:31:44,icunys,"Yes! I don't think about Sunflower too often but I can recall its melody and soundscape perfectly. It has such a soothing but uplifting sound to it, not too low-key but also not overly energetic. That Spiderman movie was also associated with it, right? The connection is definitely going to keep it in the public consciousness for a while, seeing as how Marvel movies remain incredibly popular."
1099,2020-08-20 01:43:57,icunys,"Oh, yeah, I didn't think of that one, honestly. It was a bit too earwormy for me so I wanted to forget it - that makes it more likely to stick around, I'm sure."

1101,2020-08-20 12:20:21,icunys,But.... i think the song really have potencial for a classic
1102,2020-08-20 08:18:23,icunys,Not every popular song is a classic.
1103,2020-08-19 20:14:43,icunys,"I know it was Lana's great hit that put her on the map, but I don't think it's got what it takes to be an all-time classic for the general public. The lack of a beat really sets it back in that regard. If I had to choose a possible classic just for Lana, I would pick Summertime Sadness remix, which is the only song of hers I've ever heard on the radio. (The original is better, but no, the remix isn't an abomination in my opinion.)"
1104,2020-08-20 01:24:34,icunys,Totally agree. I’ve always loved that song tbh
1105,2020-08-21 01:07:46,icunys,"Yeah definitely. I think it's just the thing now to not really push singles apart from promoting on social media and maybe releasing a video. Obviously promo can't really be done now because of covid-19, but I miss when there used to be at least 5 singles from an album with videos. Streaming has really changed the way music is promoted now."
1106,2020-08-21 01:04:43,icunys,It's also like how I Don't Know What Love Is is barely featured in the movie but it's one of my favourites!
1107,2020-08-20 01:43:53,icunys,"It's because more and more people are choosing Spotify/streaming over the radio

You have to go out of your way to listen to new music now, so it's easy to miss huge hits. 

It's really a song like Thank U, Next, which grabbed headlines because of Ariana's love life and drama, that's harder to miss"

Tame collab?  No.  Tame by definition is Kevin’s solo project (except for live, of course).  

I like Kevin’s collabs with Koi Child and Mark Ronson.  The other collabs (Gaga, Rihana, Travis, Asap) all seem a bit weak to me: they feel  like industry constructs rather than artistic projects."
1120,2020-08-19 19:55:09,ict8sh,"I think an idea like this would be cool, the only thing is, I wouldn't want it to be under the Tame Impala name. I see Tame Impala for the most part, aside from some help from band members on a couple songs in the past, as one man's singular musical vision. Disturbing that in a feature-laden album would completely ruin that magic for me.

With all that being said, if he was to release an album like that under a different name or just as 'Kevin Parker' I'd be 100% down for it. I'd love to hear what Kevin could orchestrate with a cast of guest stars on an album."

What happens though is that people read it and apply rules from their native language, so you have people that say 'jellow' and 'jes' for 'yellow' and 'yes'."
1226,2020-09-08 00:15:09,io7oi4,"I’m talking about the j sound in jello. Some speakers seem to have it in their accents and some don’t, but maybe it’s softer in some so I mistake it as not existing in it."

1234,2020-09-07 12:25:16,io609g,She’s super popular so she gets a lot of haters.
1235,2020-09-07 12:54:33,io609g,"Racism and sexism are of course big components.But a big driver of hatred among stans, is her queen/goddess persona. Many of her fans  find empowerment in it but it rubs many the wrong way. 

For stans who don't like her music,  they feel like there's societal pressure forcing them to pretend they like her music and persona. Since she's so celebrated in elite circles, it feels political to dislike her music.This dynamic causes some stans to resent Beyonce and so try to find reasons to jusitify the hatred.

But this dynamic is pretty exclusive to stan filled spaces. Outside those spaces , people who dislike Beyonce can just avoid her Spotify page."
1236,2020-09-07 18:06:27,io609g,"I see a lot of comments talking about Beyoncé not “pretending” to be relatable even if she isn’t, but that phrasing puts the onus on her and doesn’t really consider the very toxic fact that people feel that celebrities have to constantly be proving themselves to be real people. What if Beyoncé is in fact relatable and down to earth (traits that have been mentioned by other celebrities who’ve met her) and she simply doesn’t feel the need to do that per-formatively for a bunch of people on the internet she doesn’t know? Early on, Beyoncé talked about knowing how other legendary artists ended up failing, and how she was determined to not do that. They failed because they let the public into too much of their daily and personal lives, and lost control of their lives as a result. They couldn’t drive their own narrative. It’s more reflective of our culture that Beyoncé says “I’m not gonna put all my shit on social media for you to comment on” and people perceive that as “she thinks she’s better than everyone why can’t she be more relatable”."
1237,2020-09-07 12:28:44,io609g,i personally don’t dislike her but i used to find her overrated just because of her fanbase and i guess also her “queen” branding. like when her fanbase used to spam anyone who they thought was even slightly negative to her with bee emojis and would drag anyone who thought she wasn’t the greatest artist alive. they’re not that bad anymore though.
1238,2020-09-07 14:15:07,io609g,"Lemonade somehow got people thinking she doesn’t have fun or thinks she’s some kind of goddess who is untouchable, and that’s really a them problem. Any video I see of her laughing, doing anything remotely fun or human always has all these comments of like “wow I’ve never seen this side of Beyonce. I always thought she was so serious all the time.” 

This is the same woman who literally made an entire music video just goofing around in her apartment. [*SHE WAS IN AUSTIN POWERS.*](https://youtu.be/vg-ywBSbQXg)"
1239,2020-09-07 12:50:58,io609g,"I think that, in addition to the sexism, racism etc.. it also has to do with a combination of continuous success without much failure, and building distance with the public. That makes her seems super-human. The audience like a fallible icon that reminds them stars are humans, and put the public in charge of writing their story.

The public love to see big pop star, especially female pop stars, fall from grace after their massive success. Britney Spears' Breakdown, Janet Jackson' Super Bowl scandal, Mariah Carey's Glitter era, and to some extent Lady Gaga's underperforming Artpop era, Katy Perry's Witness debacle etc... And then they sometime allow a ""redemption story arc"" for the likes of Mariah Carey, Britney Spears and Lady Gaga. It sorts of give the cards to the audience. The public like to think they can both make and break icons.

But Beyoncé seems out of their control, and has been on top for 20 years with barely any underperforming era.

She's also cultivated a very curated public image with no TV interviews etc.. so you don't really get to see her personality shine on TV, on Instagram etc.. You see the Beyoncé from the music video, Vogue photoshoots... Always stunning and in control. She's rarely portrayed as a down to earth human being. I have seen countless comments on reddit asking ""*Who does she think she is? The ego!*"" after another super elaborated and glamorous performance. Admittedly I also rolled my eyes when they ""exhibited"" the stage of her 2018 Coachella performance at the 2019 edition as if it was a gift from the gods. A mythology is building around her. Whether it is her doing, or that of others, people will think she's responsible for it anyway (was it really her idea to exhibit a stage? probably not).

Rihanna has been very successful too, but the public has grown to know her outside the red-carpet glamour. She's accessible, hilarious and also prone to make mistakes on twitter/instagram and on TV interviews with Ellen or Graham Norton. So she can dress like the Pope to the Met Gala but still seems accessible.

While when Beyoncé uses the Goddess imagery at the Grammys, it rubs some people the wrong way because you never see the ""flip side"".

Madonna has also had a long successful run but she's shown her flip side... and people did not like that either!! She's always been very much hated as well. Admittedly, her outspoken and sometime problematic personality does not really allow the comparison with Beyoncé.

Edit: extended my thoughts within the comment"
1240,2020-09-07 11:55:57,io609g,"oh you know why...

sidenote, rihanna didn’t use to be this well-liked before"
1241,2020-09-08 01:05:28,io609g,"Everyone has covered the racism so I’ll say I think another part of it is how inaccessible she’s been for a while. 

When she never talks, never shows up to a chat show, never really interacts, what takes over instead is the stories. Not everyone is going to make the effort to look into her life of their own accord. She’s not there to show up and prove these stories wrong by being bubbly or relatable so shallow people just...believe the stories. If a clip of her being a goofball with Jimmy Fallon went viral, believe me public opinion would drastically shift in a week. It only took one roast for Bieber to win people over after three years of chaos. 

From a typical haters perspective, they see Beyoncé like this: 

Beyoncé headlines: diva, unattainable, godlike, above all others, outrageous demands, controlling, fake woke, political, tidal, music inaccessible til recently 

Beyoncé herself: [silence] 

So *to them* she’s basically saying “yes I am all of those things”. 

I don’t agree with any of this. It’s a dumb and mean way to think of an actual person. This is just how this type of (simple) person thinks. They see negativity about her and it isn’t debunked, so they just believe it. Because Beyoncé isn’t there to say “Actually this is me”. I see it all the time with chat show games and reddit AMAs, people saying “Wow I didn’t realise he/she was so nice and charming, never cared for them before but I’m a fan now”. 

Similar (but *not* the same) would be how Taylor vanished and it didn’t really do anything to actually diminish the hatred she got in 2016. What did work was things like putting Rep Tour on Netflix, making it accessible and showing people a bright flashy fun moment they *chose* to miss, or the Lover era being cutesy and bubblegum, rather than the hard edges and elusiveness of Rep era (I have my own annoyances with this, not allowing women the space to be mad or just...anything other than pleasant) 

Of course what matters most here is that Beyoncé does whatever the fuck she wants to do and just lives her life however. She certainly doesn’t need anyone’s validation nor should she pander for it. Taylor realised this during Rep Tour, she talked about understanding that she can still have huge landmark achievements and moments in life without any outsider approval. Rep Tour was a massive success but there’s still people convinced it wasn’t or it just didn’t register with the public the same way the 1989 era did. But it doesn’t mean it wasn’t huge. 

The idea that everything you do has to be in service of keeping everyone happy all the time is a great way to end up miserable."
1242,2020-09-08 02:02:42,io609g,"I feel like the release of Bow Down/I Been On at the beginning of 2013 changed a lot of people's perceptions of her. I remember there being a lot of ""who does she think she is!?"" reactions and I think that image has kind of stuck."
1243,2020-09-07 13:07:57,io609g,"I don't think it's simply because she's a black woman... I mean we don't even know WHO Beyonce is these days, what she's up to, and what does she have in common with us? It's easy to have misunderstandings when the artist doesn't even bother to present or explain herself. Sometimes the misunderstandings developes into hatred, but that doesn't mean it's justifiable."
1244,2020-09-07 16:30:26,io609g,"Beyoncé has a lot of control over her own image, especially during a massive information age and at a time where celebrity presence and interaction is ever prevalent on social media (in which celebrities are increasingly using social media platforms as an outlet and many new celebrities are internet personalities).

For lack of a better term, this makes Beyoncé feel odd. She's not constantly telling or showing people what she's up to, trending because she said something funny or controversial on Twitter, or having beef with some other celebrity. I think she deeply values her and her family's privacy, but because she's so much of a celebrity and extremely successful, this makes her privacy feel weird.

It's a good and a bad thing, because I feel many celebrities have their outward persona crafted or at least certain aspects of their personalities are exaggerated to sell a certain idea or image. And sometimes this can either be internalised by the celebrity or used against them. Beyoncé doesn't really give people anything to latch on to: she only uses social media as an official news platform, she rarely does interviews, and she's not out in the streets doing anything. Her persona is simply based on her works, her talent and her celebrity status.

But she's effectively a blank slate, and this means a lot of people get to project onto her what they feel about her, and it ends up being true to them because she doesn't offer an alternative. Her stans give her a lot, partially because she's earned it (no matter how you cut it, she's talented, respected and successful by her own merits), but also because as of lately she's given them so little. To be fair, the little she has given have been both very successful and acclaimed projects with a few exceptions. But this means the stans have to do the heavy lifting as she neither brags nor discusses her success publicly. And there are certain spaces that don't want to give her any credit.

Likewise her privacy has meant she's never put her fanbase in check when they go overboard, and thus people who have had a bad experience with the Beyhive or have heard stories will project their feelings for her fans onto her. ""Beyoncé fans think she's a goddess, so therefore Beyoncé herself must think she's a goddess, especially because Beyoncé hasn't said publicly that she doesn't think she's a goddess."" I think Beyoncé's ""Queen/Goddess"" image is simply something she uses for entertainment purposes, similar to how rappers talk about money they don't have in their music, how other singers sell their beauty or sex appeal, or how figures like Michael Jackson made themselves feel larger than life on screen and on stage.

I'm not offering the sole answer, as I believe other factors such as race, gender, age, social status and tastes in music play a part. I do think that in the discussion, Beyoncé's privacy and celebrity at somewhat odds with each other is a major factor as to why she is hated."
1245,2020-09-07 11:52:55,io609g,"shes a black woman

thats all it takes for someone to be hated, its insane"
1246,2020-09-08 09:25:54,io609g,"Aside from all the other reasons, I think it's also because ""Beyoncé 34 songwriters hurr durr"" as if that makes her any less of an artist"
1247,2020-09-11 12:51:07,io609g,"I got reminded of this thread because Beyoncé just made it to front page again for “expecting” the role of Tiana from The Princess and the Frog without auditioning. Despite having no credible source, it has 47k upvotes and 34(!!) awards. All the comments are shitting on her for being such an entitled overrated bitch. 

Like damn all that for a random rumor? People literally paying money to tarnish her character. She really is so unfairly and excessively hated."
1248,2020-09-07 14:14:36,io609g,"Apart from her being a black feminist, I think it's also because she tries to mantain this perfect image. If a woman seems to be almost perfect, people want her to fail (they did the same to Taylor Swift in 1989 era)."
1249,2020-09-09 01:25:21,io609g,"Beyonce started getting hate when she stopped dong music that catered to eveyone. Lmao. In 2013, she lost the support of the male general public because she had a feminist undertone, and in 2016 she lost her non-black Female support for catering to black females. Shes political and only caters to a black crowd. Plus she is black and a female. The standards are higher for her, she has to be a perfect vocalist, dancer, play instrument AND WRITE, PRODUCE, DIRECT her own videos to be considered good😂😂😂😂. While eveyone has no problem with Brittney Spears (love her), Elvis, Madonna, J Lopez, ect being medicore and calling them legends."
1250,2020-09-07 13:36:31,io609g,"I love Beyoncé but my ‘issue’ with her is how her stans hold her up to be the greatest of all time. The media also has a habit of doing this and that’s how she presents herself. She’s amazing but so are a lot of other artists. I do think a lot of her career is built on smoke and mirrors. 

And I think that’s how a lot of these conversations start. Her stans paint her out to be one thing and then the counter side to that say ‘well actually....’ But that doesn’t seem to happen as much the past couple of years as her commercial success has declined. Her fan base has humbled itself somewhat."
1251,2020-09-07 12:30:35,io609g,"She's a black woman that is at the top of her game. People like poc until they ""over achieve"" at what white people do. Also the more popular you are, the more hate you'll get."

1254,2020-09-07 18:42:34,io609g,"I’m sure there’s an element of misogynoir but I don’t think that‘s a sufficient explanation.

Let me start by saying I am far from a Beyoncé hater.  I don’t buy into stan culture in general, but I absolutely love her music and think she’s probably the greatest performer alive.  But I get why her image is off-putting.

**1**. People like authenticity.  The public has always been hungry for it (see the Spice Girls, whose cult of personality arguably outweighed the popularity of their music), but the rise of social media has really exaggerated it.  Rihanna’s popularity isn’t in spite of the fact that she’s much more open and has said things that are problematic; it’s because of it.  Her fans feel connected to her and see that she’s fallible.  Once-untouchable artists like Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga seem to have acknowledged the value of that connection as well and have made an effort to bring themselves down to earth, strip down their images, do interviews, etc.  Even the K-Pop machine - which basically breaks down the and exploits the base elements that make pop groups “work” - makes sure to cultivate (or, more likely, manufacture) that apparent connection.

So when Beyoncé completely disregards that crucial and humbling part of maintaining a strong following, opting instead for a carefully-curated, queenlike image...naturally people are going to think she’s elitist and aren’t going to like her.  I’m not sure if Homecoming was her attempt to depart from that, but if it was, it massively backfired because it just deified her even more.


**2**. Related to the above points, I honestly think it probably sucks to be in the Beyhive.  Most pop stars with big followings are very clear about how much they value their fans and make a point to connect with them.  I get that Bey no longer cares about being on the charts, but she barely interacts with or acknowledges her fans at all and she doesn’t do any promotion that would foster that feeling of connection.  And worst of all, she releases all of her new music exclusively on an expensive streaming platform that’s basically just for her and Jay-Z.  It’s a slap in the face to her most loyal followers and no other stan community has to deal with that BS."
1255,2020-09-07 14:28:16,io609g,"tbf I love Beyonce both as a person and as a visual artist, but not as a musician. I don't like most of her music and never really got the extreme hype when self titled and Lemonade dropped. I loved both albums for its visual aspects but the music was always... Eh."

1259,2020-09-07 12:13:39,io609g,"Shes a black woman, but I don’t think that’s the only thing. Often pop fans try to make hierarchies of who the best performer, singer, etc. is and Beyoncé is just like objectively top tier in every aspect. I think that upsets certain fans because Beyoncé kinda can’t be outdone. 

In the past decade Beyoncé’s image has shifted quite a bit and I think that’s another reason. Her early solo career was quite pop radio friendly but since lemonade she really hasn’t had a crazy in love/single ladies/run the world etc. I think it’s hard for some people to get why she’s gotten SO MUCH more popular or revered in the past half decade when she hasn’t had any radio hits. 

I think some people are also put off by her having her own archive/ possible fake streaming numbers?/ announcing her veganism/ thinking that she could just rent the coliseum for a music video. She’s kinda high off her own supply, but at the same time I think it’s great that as a black woman she portrays herself as royalty. It’s subversive and empowering. 

Finally, her fans are a lot. They go to extremes, and it can be off putting. Same could be said for Swifties or BTS stans. Also just because you don’t like Beyoncé’s music doesn’t mean you’re a racist. Just make sure you don’t dislike her because she’s a black woman who is great. I think her fans sometimes jump to extremes"
1260,2020-09-07 16:06:54,io609g,"I think it's one of those cases where the stans are so annoying that other people start disliking the artist because of them. That's why you hear many people say that she's overrated etc, because by many she is being treated like she is God's gift to mankind and so out of the league of everyone else. 

If you ask me, she's a phenomenal singer and performer. Unfortunately her music is very hit or miss for me, and I personally don't believe she is very involved with the actual songwriting although I have no proof of that (rumors exist, but who knows). So yeah, she's great but definitely not immaculate, which of course no one is. People (not just stans, but also characters in TV shows etc) just really overdo it with their praise sometimes and it can become hard to separate her from that in your mind."
1261,2020-09-07 17:46:18,io609g,"I think her current haters are mostly reacting to her fans. Back when Lemonade came out, it was impossible to go a few days without hearing about how she’s Queen B or how she’s a goddess or whatever and, for someone who has never been a fan of hers, it was really annoying. Pair that with the fact that her public persona as of late has been basically nothing but her own ego and it makes her really unlikable. Don’t get me wrong, Lemonade is a good album and Beyoncé is a very talented woman. I don’t begrudge her any of her success. I just don’t what she does.

Edit: I’ve come to dislike her more lately because of all the behind the scenes stuff with her in The Lion King (2019)."

1265,2020-09-07 14:36:01,io609g,"Firstly, there are sexist and racist people that will attack her for just that (even if they try using different wording to not appear like either)

Secondly, people are tired of the BeyHive and their worship of Beyoncé. They would also be aggressive and attack people that didn’t view Beyoncé the same as them. Beyoncé (as far as I’m aware) has done nothing in this regard so they start melding together.

Thirdly, there is some level of jealousy. Beyoncé is a beautiful, wealthy, powerful, and talented singer. Regardless of how she got there, she is successful and success does breed jealousy.

Fourthly, Beyoncé is receding in culturally relevance. She is coming up less and less and her projects for the last few years have either gone unnoticed or looked at for maybe and week then almost immediately forgotten about. So more people feel comfortable coming forward of not liking her music or her (for either not likening her music, not really caring about her, or either of the three reasons above).

Personally (and this applies to multiple artist, but also for Beyoncé), Beyoncé’s reputation has never matched her music. She makes good music but not “this is from the heavens” type music. The closest is probably lemonade (which I think should have won AOTY), but even then (other than a few moments) it still doesn’t match her “goddess” persona. Beyoncé isn’t the only pop artist that’s music doesn’t match the reputation and their inability to manage their expectations gives them (yes) a strong fan base but also a backlash and (the inevitable) turn when people realize you aren’t matching what you’ve promised.

I don’t have issue with Beyoncé by-the-by, I just don’t particularly care about her (musically speaking)."

Beyonce is like that,  she's super famous, gives the best performances, makes music that suits her (Not what everyone is doing) but she's still so dzamn famous.. she doesn't sell much but she makes up for that on her tours, she gets loads of awards, the industry respects her.. yet she's so private and hardly shares her life with the public.. many people can't stand that, they feel like she owes them something for ""putting her where is"" but they also hate the fact that they can say whatever about her and still she wouldn't answer. I think that's why celebrities don't shade her, you'd be fighting a losing battle anyway coz you'll be beefing alone. She's also super rich,  have a rich husband and is living the life we all would love to her. Yes Rihanna and other girls are rich but they are not Beyonce rich, and yall can say Rihanna has alot more money that Beyonce but Beyonce is like old money.. you put some respek on that, like a vintage car,  it may be old but it's super expensive and not everyone has access to them.

The most critical thing I've seen of her is one time she dressed in traditional Indian clothes and people were pressed but she apologized. I won't doubt that you've seen criticism of her but perhaps it's based on the stan culture in said space? Places where stans congregate might be overall more negative than general areas.

Her more recent music may not appeal to or empower white women and they have always been the main target of pop music & that could be the issue for some people that dislike her.

1287,2020-09-07 18:01:16,io609g,"Would people hate her just as much for this 'unobtainable' image if she was white? Because I honestly don't think so. imo a lot of underlying racism comes to the front in the sheer amount of disdain for her private, well curated persona and it's not just because people want to see successful people stumble."
1288,2020-09-07 14:29:34,io609g,"I think this is a big factor in it, especially in an age of parasocial relationships with celebrities, where through social media, we want to/are made to feel like celebrities are our friends and we can directly interact with and relate to them. Beyonce doesn't embrace that accessibility; she is larger than life, mythical, hard to read, curated, or, less charitably, above the little people. And the fact that she's a successful black woman doing this definitely plays into it (that's what I read in the ""who does she think she is"" comments), but I think it is a more general feeling of Tall Poppy Syndrome, or feeling like she's alienating because her public image is so carefully cultivated and we only get glimpses into her private life/vulnerability. 

On the one hand, I appreciate that ""Beyonce mythos"" and her mastery of her public persona and the way she's curated her career, and on the other, I understand that feeling that she's unapproachable, especially in comparison to other stars. But then again, she doesn't want to be approachable, and to be honest, I appreciate that she's just embraced it rather than try to be all ""I'm just like you!"" when that would ring so utterly false."
1289,2020-09-07 18:03:26,io609g,"I honestly think the racism+sexism and her “inaccessibility” are the two biggest factors. Whenever I see people talking about why they don’t like her, opinions about her music itself aren’t the main focus."
1290,2020-09-07 16:19:26,io609g,"This has definitely contributed to the disconnect for me. The Coachella documentary was the first time I felt like the curtain dropped even a little, and it made me appreciate her and her artistry so much more.  But then the walls went back up, and the meaning behind her music got lost for me again. 

I do think it matters what draws you to a pop icon. For me, I prefer the singer/songwriter “my music is a conversation with my life” approach instead of her untouchable deity image. I’ve come to accept that Beyoncé’s music and persona just isn’t for me because of that, but culturally this seems like something you are just not allowed to think, and for a while that had me misdirecting my frustration with that back onto her."

1296,2020-09-08 00:50:03,io609g,"I think Rihanna has a sort of accessibility built into her image that Beyoncé doesn’t. Beyoncé is elusive while Rihanna is the cool aunt, or something.

I don't see how any of these are a problem. Since the first one isn't a confirmed thing and we know EVERY single big artist has done some extremely shady/payola deals before. The second one is a non issue. Being vegan or announcing that you went vegan shouldn't be a ""negative"" thing about someone. She doesn't shame anyone for eating meat as far as I know? Lastly, the coliseum? I am still not understanding how that is a problem. These all seem like stretches. I am not sure how these translates to her being ""High off her own supply"" at all? These seem like...I don't know normal celeb things.


And yeah Beyhives were wild. But that is kind of an old statement considering just how much they've calmed down. I think the last time we seen them in full action was 2016 when they went after the ""Becky with the good hair"" which was 4 years ago. Beyhives had their time and its over now. I think its a bit disingenuous to pretend they are still even top 10 craziest online fandoms anymore. It's a new era on the internet now."

I think she also gets hate for being a black woman who owns her sexuality, doesn't feel obligated to tone herself down for a white audience, and is open about her politics. That's probably about 85% of the Why People Hate Beyonce pie chart, and then 10% is people not liking her fandom, and 5% is people who just genuinely don't like her music.

Perhaps that’s why Prince seemed like such a Luddite in the late 2000s despite his embrace of the internet earlier in the decade; he saw the oncoming tidal wave and decided that he didn’t want to be involved with all of that, thank you very much. 

It certainly is interesting how relatability has become such a selling point with pop stars. As someone who prefers artists who are larger than life personalities I personally don’t get it - if I wanted “relatable” then I’d listen to those singer-songwriters at coffee shop open mic nights."

It is psychologically harder to express ""I feel both good and bad about this,"" because it's not as strong a feeling.  Add in the internet, and it becomes even harder.  ""I thought it was okay,"" becomes a stance you have to defend, and defending it means you start to talk yourself into one extreme or the other.  

Which is one (not the only, but one) reason why I think people tend to talk about other aspects of celebrities beyond their artistic work, because they're trying to say ""I like it but don't love it,"" but they have a hard time expressing that -- and other people have a hard time hearing it.  Think of the Taylor Swift fans dragging Pitchfork for a mostly-positive review of folklore, or Rhianna fans freaking out that not every make up artist LOVES Fenty -- if you don't love it 100%, the perception is you hate it.  So people try to work around it conversationally.

It's completely garbage --and wildly unfair to the artist, who can more than likely handle minor criticism or wishy-washy feelings about their art (instead of comments about their personalities, wider life, etc)."
1325,2020-09-07 16:57:31,io609g,probably a combination of that and nostalgia. rihanna has been out of music for long enough that her music is associated with a bygone time (late 2000s-mid 2010s) and young people are nostalgic for that part of their lives now.
1326,2020-09-07 15:36:24,io609g,You're onto something!!
1327,2020-09-07 15:40:59,io609g,I just thought it was because anti was phenomenal and people have been craving more
1328,2020-09-07 15:58:32,io609g,I was always sort of neutral on her because all of her popular singles (and most of her albums as a whole) seemed like they could have been performed by any female pop artist and never seemed specific to her. That changed with Anti. I think a lot of other people felt that way.
1329,2020-09-07 13:40:37,io609g,"I hear your overall point, but she’s not the first to identify as feminist and incorporate it into her work (I’m assuming you mean huge pop artists). Madonna and Janet spent a lot of time doing that well before Beyoncé (and caused them varying hate for it too)"
1330,2020-09-07 15:33:09,io609g,"This is so true...
I see all white fans on internet claim they love Beyonce, citing her game-changing tactics, cultural relevance and chart achievements, but rarely say how they relate to her songs personally."
1331,2020-09-07 15:25:24,io609g,Ooo0h this is a hot take but honestly....I think you have a point
1332,2020-09-07 16:27:39,io609g,Hasn't thought of it like that. Great point
1333,2020-09-07 11:58:50,io609g,Every person is drooling over Megan?? When she got shot a lot of people made fun of her on twitter. When WAP was released it caused a lot of pearl-clutching and people suddenly caring about women’s bodies
1334,2020-09-07 16:26:08,io609g,"I feel like people haven't always loved rihanna as much as they do now. 
Imo a lot people don't like Megan as much as they claim :(  Just take a look at how people reacted to her getting shot."
1335,2020-09-07 11:58:12,io609g,"Beyonce isnt just a black woman, shes THE black woman imo

She is one of the most popular artists ever and racists dont react to that very well lmao. Riri is extremely popular but is not at Beyonce level, and Megan is not there at all yet"
1336,2020-09-07 16:29:34,io609g,"Of course. But there was a point in time where her stans would attack anyone who didn’t think she was the greatest thing to grace the earth. And I’ve never seen that level of gang-up mentality with any other stan base, although it does obviously happen across most fanbases to some degree. 

Like I said, it isn’t as bad as it once was because she’s not as popular anymore, but it still leaves a bad taste in people’s mouths."
1337,2020-09-07 14:47:44,io609g,"Terry Crews had a bunch of tweets calling out ""black supremacists"" and talking about how we just need to be spreading love and stuff. He got a ton of love with conservatives for this apparent rejection of BLM but what he really meant is kinda unclear."
1338,2020-09-07 12:22:49,io609g,"I’m not saying that I have a problem with it. I like her. You asked why people online don’t like her and I just listed reasons that I’ve seen on online forums and here. If you can’t handle that those are things that people have said, then why are you asking the question?"
1339,2020-09-07 19:33:15,io609g,She wasn’t abusive or anything. She didn’t show up for photo shoots of the cast and apparently didn’t even come into the studio to record her dialogue. Most of the cast was asked if they had met her and I’m pretty sure they all said no. It’s nothing damning that she should be canceled for but it makes her seem really unlikable
1340,2020-09-07 18:04:08,io609g,"My rather surface level opinion is that she embraces the worship with a bit of a ""well you said it not me"" attitude. Other artists will try to remain relatable (Ari/BTS) or just completely ignore it, continuing with their own thing (Rih/BP). But Bey seems to highlight it. So you know she agrees, but won't actually say it herself, which feels extremely pompous."
1341,2020-09-07 16:05:11,io609g,"Firstly, I didn’t say it was only a Beyoncé problem, but the question was of Beyoncé not celebrity/Stan/fandom who’re hip in general.

Second, we are talking about why people like/dislike someone a subjective topic by nature. An additional subjective view doesn’t clash with the subjective opinion. In Beyoncé’s case, her career is based of her music so people’s opinion on her music do matter in this case.

The celebrity worship is bad (just look at the BTS and Blackpink twitter stuff for exhibit A), but we are twlkin about 1 person, their fan base, and the backlash they each face because of it. If you wish a wider topic on the broader subject I have no problem with that, but a defense of “what about everyone else” is not a defense."
1342,2020-09-08 17:02:01,io609g,Every post I’ve seen him / her discuss Beyoncé here has Included a link to her charting status which backs up his / her statement. Why are you so triggered by that?
1343,2020-09-07 18:37:41,io609g,Literally this post has 3 upvotes. And almost all Beyonce drags in this thread has 10 - 100 upvotes. I don't know what you are talking about lmao.

1346,2020-09-07 14:31:18,io609g,Same with using sweatshops. Every single artist who sells clothing uses sweatshops but it’s only ever brought up about Beyoncé. Especially when [every source shows that she’s paying workers more than double the minimum wage](https://glassclothing.com/beyonce-and-sweatshops-is-ivy-park-unethical/). Not saying sweatshops are good because they aren’t *but* every celebrity who sells clothes use sweatshops for labor and I highly doubt many other celebs are paying the worker more than twice the minimum wage. So then why is Beyoncé the only one who it ever gets brought up for?
1347,2020-09-08 03:11:23,io609g,"Then I guess I'm blind? Like I actively avoid drama, gossip, and places where fighting is common (like Twitter for instance) so I maybe that's it. Like I said places where stans gather to compare popstars might be more negative. The only posts that I clicked on about her are pretty positive, like people liking her new lion king album. Maybe the people I follow are just very chill but I've only been exposed to people generally liking her. I'm not a stan and don't follow a lot of artists lives so my contact with most standoms is minimal."
1348,2020-09-07 18:30:21,io609g,I completely agree with you!
1349,2020-09-07 14:26:24,io609g,Yes agree 100% the top factors are absolutely racism and sexism. Didn’t want to insinuate it was mostly because of fans just sharing my personal experience.
1350,2020-09-07 14:27:53,io609g,"Well, that's how. If she doesn't interact with the public or her fans, some people can think that she doesn't care about them or that she is ""too relevant"" to do it. 

I agree with everything you said, but I think that it's one of the reasons that people hate her, I've heard people getting tired of Bey's image. It's stupid, but don't wait for a sensible reason to justify the hate that she receives. I never said it was Bey's responsabilty to change anything. All artists have different images/brands that people can like or not."
1351,2020-09-07 16:20:12,io609g,"It's a very different celebrity world now. I honestly think Prince and Michael would fare better than Madonna or Donna Summer or Whitney Houston as larger than life pop stars today, mostly because they're dudes (sad way of the world). Though Michael would be interesting to watch in the age of MeToo, given, well, everything we know now about him. 

I'm torn on relatability; I think some pop stars can pull it off more authentically/naturally than others, and I can appreciate that (I unabashedly have a friend-crush but also crush-crush on Rihanna), but also, I like the mystique and larger than life persona. For me, it's part of the magic of pop stardom. And as a bonus, I'm sure it makes work-life balance a lot easier; Beyonce can go home to her husband and kids and ""switch off"" from being BEYONCE, whereas stars who have much more ""relatable"" personalities can never really ""switch off"" or separate their private life from their public image."
1352,2020-09-07 13:57:35,io609g,"They said ""one of the first"" not ""the first"" and even now it still isn't totally normalized but back when Beyoncé started saying it people were much more aggressively against feminism and she caught a lot of shit for it."
1353,2020-09-07 12:02:16,io609g,"Well I would say pop fans. The most people making fun of her on Twitter were from what I could tell, men. And most of the people who didn't like WAP were men or conservatives. Which isn't as widespread. But I guess you are right. Megan doesn't have everyone under her spell but her level of vitriol for her isn't as intense in my opinion."
1354,2020-09-07 14:22:29,io609g,Rihanna has sold more than Beyonce....
1355,2020-09-07 12:43:26,io609g,"This isn't true at all, Rihanna is more famous internationally than Beyonce, most of Beyonce's hit singles are not that famous outside some countries......Rihanna is the biggest hitmaker of the century"
1356,2020-09-08 20:18:38,io609g,Idk about America but here in south asia the only time I hear Beyonce's name is because of buzzfeed type article. On the other hand rihanna is extremely popular. Umbrella rude boy and love the way you lie were extremely popular here in India.
1357,2020-09-07 18:33:43,io609g,Every stans of every artists do that. That is the issue. Really doesn't make any sense form that angle. I've experienced death threats and doxxing from my own fandom back in 2017. Doesn't mean that I hate the group the fans originated from since I know each fandom would so something as shitty.
1358,2020-09-07 12:23:34,io609g,Because I thought there would be...legitimate reasons? These just seem like excuses to me. I don't know. Thanks for answering though! I'll be sure to take it into consideration.
1359,2020-09-07 22:52:35,io609g,"I don’t see what’s wrong with that - maybe she just had prior commitments or could be a very introverted person...

If the cast and crew didn’t have a problem with it (and in actuality praised her) why should I?"
1360,2020-09-07 16:15:29,io609g,"I know we’re talking about Beyoncé rn but I think a defense of “what about everyone else” is incredibly valid here bc it applies. I only bring it up bc much of the backlash she receives (not talking about you specifically) is disproportionate to her peers considering the fact she often gets hate for stuff that everyone else is also guilty of. So again, that begs the question - what about everyone else?"
1361,2020-09-08 17:03:02,io609g,You’re one of literally 15 people subscribed to his failed podcast’s subreddit so I feel like your position doesn’t matter here
1362,2020-09-07 14:03:55,io609g,"But that makes it even more clear that you assume she makes hip hop because she’s black, just like how disco was a predominately black genre. That’s a super close minded way of thinking"
1363,2020-09-08 03:13:14,io609g,So like the [thread about Black is King ](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/i61c05/beyonc%C3%A9s_black_is_king_attracts_less_than_4_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)that had to be locked because of how disgusting it got? That was directly about her Lion King album and it got biscuits towards her for no reason
1364,2020-09-07 14:35:57,io609g,"I don't think you were insinuating that at all. I think that a lot of things are at play in why people don't like Beyonce, and I do agree that the fandom can be a turnoff for people (fandom horror stories have definitely been a turnoff for me in other forms of media; I'm only just now starting to watch Voltron: Legendary Defender now, for instance, because while it was airing, all I heard about was how toxic the fandom was, and it turned me off of giving the show a shot)."
1365,2020-09-07 14:34:32,io609g,"But many artists are like that - my issue with many criticism of Beyoncé (not all, I’m not necessarily talking about yours) is that she gets criticized especially hard for things that can be applied to everyone, and yet she’s the only one getting criticized for these things which to me means people are also just masking their hate behind some of these “criticism.” Also, celebrity, fame, wealth, and talent are all inherently unrelatable things and we shouldn’t aspire for celebrities to appear relatable when that doesn’t change the fact that they’re not and just incapable of being so due to their position in society. Your favorite artist interacting with you (their fans) on social media or doing interviews doesn’t change the fact that it’s always going to be a one sided relationship that they stand to benefit from, but you don’t. They’re not our friends and they can’t relate to us. Beyoncé May seem unrelatable now, but that’s how celebrities used to be. If they weren’t promoting something, we didn’t hear from them. Also, given her tumultuous history with the media and the public it makes sense that she does that."
1366,2020-09-07 16:00:34,io609g,"A lot of people are forgetting that even in 2013, we had pop girls saying things like, “I don’t identify as a feminist because I don’t hate men” or “I believe men and women are equal but I wouldn’t call myself a feminist”"
1367,2020-09-07 13:58:35,io609g,"When she performed her self-titled medley at the VMAs and had “FEMINIST” projected behind her during Flawless, she was *torn apart* online for it. I remember **bell hooks** was even talking shit about her! It was insane"
1368,2020-09-07 14:01:35,io609g,"Ha, you’re right. Early morning eyes didn’t read it correctly. I was like ... surely that can’t be what they mean! 

Also, to be clear, I totally buy this a big reason why she gets hate (on top of the fact that she’s black). I’m a massive Janet stan, so no one has to convince me black women who own their sexuality get hate.

ETA: I also think her popularity being during the internet times vs when her predecessors were doing their thing adds a lot to this."

1370,2020-09-08 00:18:14,io609g,"Ah the classic sales over all argument.

If this carried weight Taylor Swift, Drake and Ed Sheeran would be some of the greatest artists of all time. 

I actually prefer Rihannas music as a whole to Beyonces ever so slightly so I'm kind of hypocritical, but I'm waiting for Rihanna to drop a Lemonade. A Freedom. Closest she's come to a cohesive record like Lemonade is Anti. It just hasn't happened yet. Beyonce is the more critically acclaimed artist, Rihanna is the commercially more successful artist"

1372,2020-09-07 12:46:07,io609g,"OP was asking why she is hated online and especially on subs like this, more than 50% of Reddit’s userbase is American

Americans have an overwhelming majority here"

1374,2020-09-07 14:44:04,io609g,"I think if you want to get better answers to this question you need to find people who actually hate her and ask them. There's a lot of people here who will give tons of reasons why other people might hate her, but the only way to really what a group is thinking is to ask them directly."
1375,2020-09-08 00:03:09,io609g,"The issue for me is it makes her seem like an asshole. Like, from my point of view, it seems like she thinks she’s too good to actually put in the effort to show up. It makes it seem like she has a massive ego which isn’t a good look for anyone"
1376,2020-09-08 04:38:56,io609g,"Is there a reason for all the downvotes? I'm trying to answer the question within the framing of not having seen a lot of negativity directed at beyonce. I think it's because I don't go on stan heavy threads, like the one above. I just watched reviews from people like screen Junkies and Breakfast All Day and they seem to like her, and in the general public most people I've talked to seem to like her too. My opinion is that it's something I see in stan heavy spaces more than general discussions. If I have to pin why it's prevalent in stan spaces it's a combo of the competitive nature of fandom and misogynoir resulting in toxicity. But out in regular life I've never had someone get nasty about liking Beyonce."
1377,2020-09-07 14:53:58,io609g,"Sorry, but I never said that Beyoncé is the only artist who is like that. I don't think that she's the only one getting criticized for hard things. Correct me if I'm wrong but, maybe you're a fan and you're aware of all the feedback that she receives, either positive or negative?

I agree that fame and wealth are things that celebs can't hide, but I still think that there are differents ways to portray it. Just look at this [interview](https://youtu.be/0wIKsySKJ00) of Shakira and Jlo, and also their SB performance, they look super different! Shakira is portraying a more ""casual"" image and Jlo a more ""diva"", you can appreciate that in her clothes and posture. Some people prefer the ""casual/humble image"", maybe because they can relate more, but that doesn't mean that the ""diva image"" is bad at all! It's just some people dislike it, personally I think that it's because of envy. In my opinion, Beyoncé portrays a diva image, but that's not something bad, and if people dislike her for that it's their business, but it's okay if they don't like that image.

I agree with you with social media. Some fans have been hating on Lady Gaga for the past few years for not interacting in social media too. It makes sense considering how harmful social media can be. It's okay if Bey doesn't want to interact, but some people may prefer someone who interacts or chats on Twitter, not saying it's something bad or good."
1378,2020-09-07 15:45:57,io609g,Spot on! I get that her music is not everyone's taste but I've also noticed that some people hate/criticise her for the same things other female artists do. We know why though.
1379,2020-09-07 18:31:01,io609g,"Not really but that is okay to think so! As you can see in this thread, all criticisms of Beyonce even unfair ones are receiving high amounts of upvotes. I got my answer."
1380,2020-09-07 16:51:16,io609g,"I think they're on a comparable level. Maybe not in terms of album sales, but they're both key parts of western pop culture. Ask most people in the English speaking world who Beyonce *or* Rihanna is and they'll know."
1381,2020-09-07 12:48:22,io609g,"Yeah in america Beyonce is more regarded than Rihanna for sure but you said that Beyonce is bigger than Rihanna which is not true globally 


She is hated because her fans treat her like she's some God and at Michael jackson's level or something which ain't true at all both in terms of impact and sales

Also many people don't like her recent musical outputs"
1382,2020-09-07 17:00:10,io609g,Century is from 2000 and Rihanna is the biggest hitmaker since 2000
1383,2020-09-08 20:36:10,io609g,"Yeah, I’m not getting that from her whatsoever"
1384,2020-09-07 14:59:38,io609g,"My point goes back to people portray fame and wealth - to me it’s dishonest and essentially false advertising to present fame or wealth as anything close to relatable. You can put lipstick on a pig, but it’s still a pig. I’m trying to say is that we (the public) shouldn’t desire or pretend that these celebrities share anything in common with us- they simply don’t. “Relatable” celebrity/capitalism is just as bad, if not even more (insidious) bc people are more willing to get away with stuff on account of their “relatability” and image. Unfortunately, I know that’s how the world works (appearances are reality to an extent) but it doesn’t change the fact that it’s wrong that it’s that way"
1385,2020-09-08 21:44:45,io609g,"That’s fine, you don’t have to. But that’s what I get from her and I don’t like it"
1386,2020-09-07 15:13:41,io609g,"Well, I think that it's just your preference. I don't think that when celebs wear casual clothes are trying to portray fame in an erroneous way, they may just like to wear them. Because I don't think that all celebs spend their time wearing brand clothes all the time. There are celebrities who live a more private life than others, celebs who are wealthier than others... That's up to the public who they prefer to follow. If people like to see relatable celebs, it's because they can feel even more identified with them. Simply. It's not better or worse than the contrary. 

My point with Beyoncé, is that she has adquired the ""untouchable diva image"", that some people will dislike and others don't. For me, it's not a problem really, but it's okay if some people don't like it."
1387,2020-09-07 15:17:11,io609g,"Oh no maybe you misunderstood me. I definitely am not criticizing the clothes (that’s one of my favorite things about pop music - the aesthetics, the performance, the mythos/personality, the larger than life aspect and just the overall extravagance). I’m talking about how entertainers relate to the public and this expectation of late (really within the last decade with the rise of social media) that celebrities are doing something wrong if they don’t stoop to our level and feign relatability."
1388,2020-09-07 16:43:37,io609g,"I completely agree with this. While all celebrities are certainly human and should be viewed as people who have different personalities, people need to realise that as long as we're with them when they're home or with their family, they're still putting up a front. An image of having a carefree, relatable persona is still a front, even if it appeals to you more."
1389,2020-09-07 16:57:34,io609g,"Exactly. Having a public persona or just being a celebrity in general is a job that’s dependent on your performance in public. Just like when regular people are at their jobs, we’re performing as well. Not to say that we’re being fake but there’s a level of professionalism and boundaries that you have to maintain both for your livelihood and to protect yourself. How we engage with our close friends and family will be different than how we engage with our boss or colleagues. Similarly, when you first meet someone, you’re not going to expose your whole personality - you have to get to know them first, decide if you’re comfortable around them and then act accordingly, however that may be"

# Posts with low effort truth statements are not allowed.

Your submission is considered ""low effort."" This doesn't inherently mean that it was *irrelevant* to r/technicallythetruth, but instead it was removed because it fit one or more of these criteria:

* Short, minimal-effort text posts like ""a water bottle without water is an air bottle"". Most, if not all text posts can and will be removed.

* Asking for upvotes, or saying things like ""sort by new"", ""let's get to the front page"", or anything related to cake days or karma.

* [Meta memes](https://imgur.com/qgkCskm), or any other post that tries to be clever by mentioning r/technicallythetruth.

* [Images that are hard to look at](https://imgur.com/yuMwr8a) because they are poorly made, deep-fried, or poorly cropped.

**Your submission could have also been removed because it is overdone:**

* Statements that say something like ""at least twelve"": [example 1](https://imgur.com/K1ZwEAv) | [example 2](https://imgur.com/dIkwEpU)

* Common statements that begin with ""on average..."": *the average amount of hands a person has is less than two* | *each person has, on average, one testicle and one boob*

* Low effort misunderstandings of everyday phrases: *How high are you  --> ""I'm 5 foot 9""* 

* Common insults that are meant literally as opposed to being insulting: *""homosexuals are gay""* | *""gay people are f-ing assholes""*

It’s just pretty obvious that he’s a bit of a perfectionist so we are never gonna see the typical album-per-year output with him, and in my opinion that sort of adds something special to his music. Every song has a purpose - there’s not really much ‘filler’. Even if it’s an interlude, it ties 2 songs together. I’d much rather wait 4 years (or more) for a quality album than have him put out trash more often (like some artists...) that have maybe one or two good songs on them."

We don’t know the time and care Frank takes with his music. Plus he doesn’t owe the fans anything, not a single damn thing. Blonde came out 4 years after Channel Orange and I believe it was well worth the wait. Now Blonde is considered one of the greatest albums of all time. 2020 was when everyone expected his third album to drop, but after the passing of his brother, it doesn’t look likely (which is completely understandable). Why would Frank put out another album for “fans” like you?"

Edit: frank literally never wanted fans so he’s probably not wrong when he says frank doesn’t care about us. I just find it odd that when this was said months ago, people agreed and said “it’ll come when it comes” now that Ryan is gone you gotta watch what you say I guess."
1514,2020-10-10 04:36:01,j8b8bp,I love Nas. But who cares?
1515,2020-10-10 00:10:21,j8abpn,"Personally I think R&B is thriving. I haven't heard the argument that it's dying/dead so if anyone holds those beliefs, could you provide your reasoning?"
1516,2020-10-10 02:27:04,j8abpn,"chloe x halle, ari lennox, kiana lede, ella mai, kehlani, h.e.r., summer walker, jorja smith, jhene aiko... lots of artists thriving in r&b."
1517,2020-10-10 02:19:11,j8abpn,i don’t think r&b is dead it’s just a LOT different then the 90s golden age. i don’t think it has the chart power it used to and i don’t know if it can again. i think  r&b and rap fused together over the past 10 years bc really the biggest r&b artist is probably drake.
1518,2020-10-10 03:05:53,j8abpn,"I think people need to let go of the idea of that popular wave of RnB from the 90's making a come back, and along those same lines: also let go of their expectations for 90's era RnB to have a revival, and instead embrace the new directions and subgenres that RnB has been moving towards in these recent times. 


I don't pick up this vibe as much from genres other than RnB from the fans: a lot of people when listening to RnB nowadays are so quick to write off recent songs and artists unless the new RnB getting put out is reminiscent to what was coming out of the 90's. I don't wanna say ""move on!"" but rather maybe instead acknowledge that RnB's highpoint has come and gone (for now! Maybe there will be a resurgence in the future!) where hits are consistently being put out by numerous different artists. If ya care about RnB as a genre and the culture associated with it: support the newer acts you like and allow them the space to explore the new sounds that the genre is developing. 


Like someone else said, RnB is doing pretty well right now. To me: it's just a matter of finding what ya vibe with and letting these new acts find their groove instead of bopping them on the head with a Whack-A-Mole mallet when they don't sound like D'Angelo or Brandy."
1519,2020-10-10 01:11:14,j8abpn,"I don’t think R&B is necessarily dead, but it’s definitely in the same “quiet” state that pop music was in in 2018. I would love to see Ella Mai lead the resurgence. She deserves to be way bigger than she is (though I’m still a little disappointed in the Chris Brown collab)."
1520,2020-10-10 03:53:34,j8abpn,"Chloe x Halle, Kehlani, Ella Mai, Jhene Aiko, HER, maybe SZA, etc are all definitely leading the revival or new sound of R&B. 

Especially Chloe and Halle are the perfect mix of 90's and new sound."
1521,2020-10-10 05:50:21,j8abpn,Not dead at all it’s just evolved!
1522,2020-10-10 00:18:23,j8abpn,I think it has made a comeback but I think that in future it will have more trap influence
1523,2020-10-10 03:19:34,j8abpn,It likely will eventually. Trends come and go.
1524,2020-10-10 13:54:05,j8abpn,"R&B from Black artist? Maybe when racism actually gets addressed in music. 

Hip hop is still in vogue in the streaming era... I always felt like they dabble into R&AB"
1525,2020-10-10 00:22:59,j8abpn,"Yeah agreed. R&B (and melodic trap, which is often mislabeled as R&B) is huge right now. I don't get what OP is talking about."
1526,2020-10-10 05:01:04,j8abpn,Jojo
1527,2020-10-10 02:30:03,j8abpn,"chloe x halle are r&b? weird, i always thought they sounded more poppy. they just don't belong to the same genre that you mentioned the other artists belong to."
1528,2020-10-10 01:43:54,j8abpn,"If Joe Biden wins, I think music will move away from the ""quiet"" state and revert back to the 2009-2012 ""feel-good"" dance era."
1529,2020-10-10 05:40:42,j8abpn,"I’m gonna personally disagree with you there, tons of their songs are R&B or at least R&B influenced pop :)"
1530,2020-10-10 19:19:33,j8abpn,Maybe but whoever wins next month it’s going to be chaos for a good while.

Young, action girl Sybill instead of a middle-aged, posh, dragon breeder who knows how to change the world by writing letters and holding a harp recital is grounds enough to dismiss it as rubbish."
1534,2020-10-10 00:00:44,j89kjm,"One good thing about it is it inspired me to read all the guards books again..... but seeing the carrots in the produce section at the grocery does that too, so."
1535,2020-10-10 00:12:52,j89kjm,"Rhianna knows her father's work better than any of us. She went on to write the Overlord games, the gameplay isn't the best but I ADORE the writing, it has the Pratchett DNA inside of it, almost like he wrote some of it hinself."

At least we still have the books."
1540,2020-10-09 23:49:44,j89kjm,"Everything i have seen about the BBC watch makes it look worse. Like, you would think it would reach a nadir at some point, but it keeps getting worse."
1541,2020-10-10 03:13:48,j89kjm,"I picture Sybil as sort of a female version of a strong man. Like, she looks squishy, she has fat that hides her muscle mass, but she could stop a train in its tracks. Sybil is fat, but she’s also strong as hell. The woman breeds dragons, dammit."
1542,2020-10-10 03:17:05,j89kjm,Good Omens was so fucking good. Why did they have to screw up The Watch so badly?
1543,2020-10-10 00:10:58,j89kjm,"It is a WINO: Watch In Name Only.

Which may also be an incoherent mess that bears no resemblence to the character underneath due to the ravages of idiotic, ignorant producers. 

For the analogy, idiotic ignorant producers would be those who make Blue Nun.

P.S. this whole comment is not to make fun of alcohol dependency, just running toward an open goal with a fitting acronym, something I hope Sir Pterry would approve of!"
1544,2020-10-10 02:06:04,j89kjm,"I’d never heard of this so just had a look at the trailer and must say it’s made me feel quite sad if not slightly traumatised. It’s as if someone at BBC America just said “this Terry Pratchett bloke sold over 80mil books so there’s a fan base ripe for the picking. I’ve flicked through the first few pages of a couple of his books about a city watch so there’s no need for you to worry about reading any of them. Here’s a list of character names. Go and make a tv series will you?” 
I don’t understand at all. At least being in Australia it hopefully never appears here."
1545,2020-10-10 00:55:10,j89kjm,"So it’s just like Pratchett’s Watch except for the magic, humor, irony, fabulous characters, excellent writing, imagination, wit, wisdom, etc ?  Sam Vimes would have an appropriately pithy quote but all I can think of is include me out.  And my weird thing for Angua obviously isn’t going to be pandered to either."
1546,2020-10-10 04:11:14,j89kjm,"It gets easier to understand if you imagine the sequence of events like this:   
Johnny mcdoesntexist wanted to make a TV show that called back to the English punk scene he grew up in. But noone wanted to give him the money to make it.   
So he looked around until he found an appropriately dissident IP that'd let him make the world he wanted, attached to an name big enough to wow the finance guys into giving him money.  
It never was a discworld story, just one that coincidentally shared names and plot points."
1547,2020-10-10 00:57:32,j89kjm,"I just watched a trailer for it.  
I wish I hadn't.  

What the hell were they thinking?!!!"
1548,2020-10-10 00:30:12,j89kjm,"You go girl.

Just from the first teaser photo they released you could tell it would share basically nothing with the original.

Damn shame, that.  I'd love to see a Discworld series of movies done by someone who loves them and actually knows what the hell they're about."
1549,2020-10-10 00:29:41,j89kjm,"The balls on the writers of this show to think they can do a better job than Terry Pratchett. 

This is not an adaptation this is taking the names and concept and writing something new, something worse. 

From what is show I can't believe that anybody with any creative input has even read the books.

I thought Star Wars was a fuck up..."
1550,2020-10-10 00:30:12,j89kjm,Dumb question: doesn't rihanna have stewardship of discworld now? Shouldn't she have been involved/kept appraised of how off track it was getting?
1551,2020-10-10 08:25:51,j89kjm,As a standalone TV show unrelated to PTerry/Discworld it looks great. As an adaption of The Watch? Kill it with fire I'm genuinely upset at how badly they've mutilated my favourite book.
1552,2020-10-10 00:17:26,j89kjm,That’s so unfortunate that it decided to embrace so little from the books. Has it actually aired yet? I haven’t seen anything from it aside from some of the released pictures.
1553,2020-10-10 00:04:35,j89kjm,"This is almost an okay version of pre-sober Vimes, at least up until the actual flipping off. Vetinari might be... tolerable. Everything else is garbage. `p`

Not my Carrot!"
1554,2020-10-10 06:06:59,j89kjm,"There are so many things wrong in the trailer alone that there is no way I will ever watch this unless I'm incredibly bored and drunk/high.

The acting, the actors, the punk-rock (where the hell does this even come from?!). Everything I've seen looks like shit. 

If there is no shared DNA, don't fucking use the name, characters (somewhat) and story of the source material. This is just sickening."
1555,2020-10-10 12:16:33,j89kjm,"I think discworld is so personal to so many people that ar this point it would be almost impossible to adapt it in a way to please everybody. 
Having watched the trailer for the watch it seems they have managed to do the opposite and create something not one single discworld fan will be happy with."
1556,2020-10-10 06:40:41,j89kjm,"The more I think about it, the more sad I am about all this. It's struck me recently as unfair that there are fantasy novels out that that have had multiple adaptations. We've never had a TV adaptation of any _Watch_ books. And things like this feel like they diminish the chances of getting a proper one in the future."
1557,2020-10-10 01:04:35,j89kjm,"I think the show looks interesting. But only if you have no knowledge of the books. If I try to compare it in any way to the books, it immediately falls apart. I might watch it, but I will do so with the knowledge that it isn't Discworld and Pratchett's version."
1558,2020-10-10 01:30:37,j89kjm,Does anyone know who the showrunner is for this?  I'd love to know who to hate.
1559,2020-10-10 07:14:30,j89kjm,Who where they trying to please with it?
1560,2020-10-10 09:08:50,j89kjm,"I have always wondered why TV and film producers take a property and then turn it into something entirely different - why did you pay for the property then? You may as well make a new set of characters and save some money. 

As Rhianna says, the DNA is gone. What is remaining about the Pratchett watch that was worth paying for the property?

I cannot see the name recognition doing much as fans will be put off rather than engaged."
1561,2020-10-10 12:52:55,j89kjm,"For me, the reason this feels like such an egregious affront is how much they've fucked about with Vimes. He's such a strongly realised character in the books, and he feel very much like Pratchett's personal Discworld proxy or avatar. I remember feeling a sense of dual despair when Sir Terry died because it also felt like Vimes had died as well. Obviously that was true of all the characters, but with Vimes it just felt so much more personal.

Making him what appears to be a pantomime drunk is a bafflingly terrible decision and you'd almost swear it was the show's creators directly mocking Pratchett and his legacy."
1562,2020-10-10 01:33:53,j89kjm,This is so disappointing.
1563,2020-10-10 08:25:52,j89kjm,Was the BBC sane enough to realise that the fan base would treat this as the WORST way to put out anything connected to Sir Terry?

1569,2020-10-10 15:09:13,j89kjm,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but going by the trailer it looks like they've changed it to Carcer summoning the dragon? I've also heard he's now supposed to be more of a lovable anti-hero type?

&#x200B;

That's bloody disappointing, Carcer is just a psychopath. Like a Discworld version of the Joker, he just enjoys chaos."
1570,2020-10-10 16:30:01,j89kjm,seriously about to cry I'm so mad. WTF was that?
1571,2020-11-29 10:08:09,j89kjm,"Just in case you’re wondering how the BBC could produce such a monstrosity as this, this was not commissioned by the BBC itself. Even the Beeb knows to treat its source material with respect - look at the Chronicles of Narnia miniseries from 1967 and 1988. No this was made by their American branch."
1572,2021-01-03 22:20:56,j89kjm,"Thank you for finding this. I was really upset when I realized it was going to be on a streaming service I don't have and don't want to subscribe to. And I've heard some terrible reviews. But Rihanna's comment gives me some closure if that makes sense... I'll buy it on a physical medium if it's ever available, like I did with Chernobyl instead of subscribing to HBO. But knowing that even she isn't excited about it makes me feel less FOMO."
1573,2020-10-10 05:18:25,j89kjm,"At the end of the day we can be upset that an adaption isn't faithful enough but let's not work this up to be more than it is. We will always have the books. The legacy of Terry Pratchett is secure. 

Let's not stoop to hate and bitterness. Pterry would want his fans to be better than that."
1574,2020-10-10 03:34:36,j89kjm,"They're going for something different. That's cool. I like different. But it's a big risk. The material from the books, *especially* when it comes to the Watch, is so goddamn great. Maybe you can change it around and create something better, but you're almost guaranteed to make it great just by sticking to the source material.

So again, I like when they change things up. But it's going to be tough to beat the original. And it's going to be hard to get Discworld fans on board when they *know* how great the original is, but they have *something else* instead. I'm not saying it's impossible. This could very well be an incredible show. I'm not in love yet, although there isn't much to see so far. The punk rockish vibe is odd, and I'm not necessarily convinced by some of the casting decisions. Vimes in particular. The trailer isn't much to rely on, so we'll wait and see."
1575,2020-10-11 01:49:23,j89kjm,"Maybe they were already making a fantasy crime show and  someone thought that it sounded like the watch from discworld, so they just went ah fuck it and bought the liscence"
1576,2020-10-22 22:20:43,j89kjm,"Unfortunately, I am not surprised at this, having seen what the BBC did with War of the Worlds."
1577,2020-10-10 09:36:46,j89kjm,"Vimes comes across as a bit of a wimp, being bossed about by Sybil."

1579,2020-10-10 00:09:27,j89kjm,"Yes it does. 

For crying out loud...it’s different, but there is very obviously common underlying threads."
1580,2020-10-10 00:45:44,j89kjm,"THIS. 

I am gutted by how they treated Sybil and having “friends” act like I’m in the wrong for being upset only makes it worse. 

At the end of the day, sure, it’s just a show and I won’t lose sleep over it or think less of anyone who likes it.  But these books are so important to me and I was hoping for much MUCH more."
1581,2020-10-10 01:05:45,j89kjm,"This absolutely baffles me. They had such a great opportunity to show a strong, non-stereotypical female character without changing ANYTHING from canon... And they did this instead. 

But hey, you can't really be a strong woman without physically kicking ass, am I right? God forbid we show a prominent female character acting conventionally feminine in any way. And a ""badass action hero"" has to look a certain way, so they changed it."
1582,2020-10-10 00:45:49,j89kjm,"Agreed.

The only reason I can see to change that character is that whoever is in charge of all this never read enough of the source material to understand what the character is really about.

That would explain a lot of the changes actually, the writers only exposure to discworld being through being told about it by someone who;

A) had only skimmed a few of the books once

B) was absolutely shit-faced, both when telling the writers about the books, and during their reading of the books"
1583,2020-10-10 01:21:21,j89kjm,"THAT WAS SYBIL. Oh my god, I hadn't made the connection. I thought she was maybe Angua until the other Angua showed up. Good lord."

1588,2020-10-10 01:14:28,j89kjm,"I didn't know the show existed until I saw this post, but I hate it immensely based on this alone."
1589,2020-10-10 06:39:27,j89kjm,"Mmhm, that's a particular blow. I had a previous partner that reminded me strongly of Sybill, looks and temperament included.  Would've been wonderful to have someone like her play the part.  Still can't get over what they seem to have done to Cheery, either.  And *Vimes*....! They gutted the man's personality, reminiscent of bad taxidermy."
1590,2020-10-10 00:41:20,j89kjm,Agreed

1611,2020-10-10 00:31:43,j89kjm,That made me laugh a lot!
1612,2020-10-09 23:57:47,j89kjm,"Lets take books that have sold millions of copies, announce that we are going to make a series like fans have begged for years, and lets totally not use any of the original characters other than their names!  Slam dunk, right?"
1613,2020-10-10 16:02:40,j89kjm,"Quote from Thud:

""Sybil’s female forebears had valiantly backed up their husbands as distant embassies were besieged, had given birth on a camel or in the shade of a stricken elephant, had handed around the little gold chocolates while trolls were trying to break into the compound, or had merely stayed at home and nursed such bits of husbands and sons as made it back from endless little wars.  The result was a species of woman who, when duty called, turned into solid steel."""
1614,2020-10-10 08:27:56,j89kjm,"Somebody further up suggested Miranda Hart, which got an immediate ""Fuck Yes!"" from me. She would have fit the character perfectly."
1615,2020-10-10 09:22:47,j89kjm,Like Trunchbull from Matilda but nice...
1616,2020-10-10 18:55:35,j89kjm,"Good Omens was Neil Gaiman's tribute to Sir PTerry.
   
That tribute is even why the American Gods show was put on hiatus.  No one wanted to disrespect Gaiman's work, and nothing was going to stop him from finishing Good Omens."
1617,2020-10-10 11:01:06,j89kjm,"Good Omens and Hogfather were fantastic examples of how to do an adaptation properly. I even liked Colour of Magic and Light Fantastic quite a bit, and they changed a fair amount for those. 

If you're going to adapt a book the first thing is to accept that the author knows what they're doing and are better at it than script writers. It's the script writer's job to make the source material work onscreen, *not* to fundamentally change the material itself."

1619,2020-10-12 16:38:42,j89kjm,"So, apart from all of that, it's exactly like Sir Terry's Watch!"
1620,2020-10-10 03:38:42,j89kjm,">So it’s just like Pratchett’s Watch except for the magic, humor, irony, fabulous characters, excellent writing, imagination, wit, wisdom, etc ?

Lots of conclusions from, what, a 1 minute trailer?

I mean, I'm not exactly optimistic about it myself after watching that trailer, but let's not get crazy... yet."
1621,2020-10-10 06:32:45,j89kjm,And I hate this.
1622,2020-10-10 16:28:03,j89kjm,"More like the late 90s british emo scene, and I was a part of that.... gotta say didn't  age well."

1624,2020-10-10 05:10:35,j89kjm,"The problem is the contract gave a portion of creative control to Terry Pratchett, by name, and not to Narrativia, which is in the hands of Rhi and Rob now. Since the person named in the contract is deceased, they got shut out, and couldn’t stop this from happening. They’re both pretty salty about it, as are we all."
1625,2020-10-10 00:49:02,j89kjm,"The question keeps coming up, it seems that any creative control was given up very early in the process, if it existed at all.

Why that would be agreed to I have no idea, but that's a separate point. Basically they have no power over the direction that this is going."
1626,2020-10-10 02:18:04,j89kjm,I think they have the rights from before Terry passed iirc
1627,2020-10-10 06:31:48,j89kjm,"Someone on here linked some very good analysis a while. It's complicated and due to the nitty gritty of existing contracts, I think. But basically no, she and Rob have tried and failed to steer the project in a proper direction and have now given up and washed their hands of it."
1628,2020-10-10 16:31:57,j89kjm,"It's kinda pathetic  but I'm a 34 yr old bloke who was legitimately upset by a 1 minute  trailer.

Urg might as well give up and grab a fedora.

I'm gonna give it a chance just so I'm not that guy, I will try my hardest to ignore the eyeliner."
1629,2020-10-10 03:19:51,j89kjm,Why even make it if they were going to ignore the books? The characters are what make the books so amazing
1630,2020-10-10 11:11:32,j89kjm,The first trailer was released yesterday. The series is set to air in January 2021.
1631,2020-10-10 00:40:35,j89kjm,"I don’t know about you, but to me, Vimes in the BBC version looks like a literal meth addict. That’s not how alcoholics act, that’s how tweakers act. 1/10."
1632,2020-10-10 01:20:47,j89kjm,"Not my Angua! 

Seriously, of all the characters to race-swap, why the one who’s physical description actually plays a part in her daily life? They could’ve at least done long hair!"
1633,2020-10-10 01:12:04,j89kjm,"Vetinary's actress' acting is okay, but with the way this adaptation is going, it's now VERY clear that they made the original character a woman *strictly* because ""girl power"". And I'm not sure I appreciate that - way too on-the-nose."

1636,2020-10-10 09:41:50,j89kjm,Mostly because Terry didn't like what studios wanted to do to his works.
1637,2020-10-10 03:45:56,j89kjm,"Yeah. I'm wondering who they're trying to appeal to. Fans of Discworld interested in an accurate adaptation are sure to be disappointed. People who've never heard of Discworld may like it, although I'm not sure why they need to use the Discworld IP if that's who they're targeting. Perhaps it's for fans of Discworld who are *not* looking for a true adaptation but instead want something ""different."" I mean, I guess there may be a crowd of people like that. I am at least *open* to something different. I think it's just going to be hard to impress me, particularly because the source material is so, so good. It's going to be hard to watch this and think, ""yep, these character and story changes are certainly better than what Pratchett came up with!"" 

Again, I'll keep my mind open. I *do* appreciate when they try to ""do things differently"" with adaptations. I want to be surprised and impressed, so it's ok if they want to change things up. But, you know, *it better be good!*"
1638,2020-10-10 11:06:05,j89kjm,"Yes, this!"
1639,2020-10-10 03:48:52,j89kjm,"Eh. Let's not hate until we can see more than 1 minute of the show. But here are some names to get you started:

>On October 30, 2018, BBC America announced that it ordered an eight-episode series of The Watch written by Simon Allen together with Joy Wilkinson, Catherine Tregenna, Amrou Al-Khadi and Ed Hime. Hilary Simon and Phil Collinson will be executive producers; the director is Craig Viveiros.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Watch_(TV_series)"
1640,2020-10-10 09:22:36,j89kjm,The BBC accountants.
1641,2020-10-10 16:33:05,j89kjm,"Perhaps  not enough  of us to make money.

But I dont see who will enjoy it, I guess it gives me buffy vibes, buffy was fun sooo."
1642,2020-10-11 01:16:23,j89kjm,Nonexistent. Not punk enough for this.
1643,2020-10-10 12:26:25,j89kjm,Going Postal was quite good. Vetinari especially
1644,2020-10-10 00:18:09,j89kjm,"The Watch and Discworld share about as much underlying threads as LotR and Pride & Prejudice. 

And that's being generous.

I'm still going to watch it, might contain a few hidden gems snuck in by people that cared."
1645,2020-10-10 09:48:03,j89kjm,Think she's talking about underlying themes and the style and such. The characterisation and feel of the show. Not so much the names and plot points.
1646,2020-10-10 03:55:50,j89kjm,"One of the things I *love* about the Discworld fan community as a whole is that the objections are to her being young, thin, and pretty, but basically nobody batted an eye at her being Black. I’m kind of proud of that."
1647,2020-10-10 17:53:43,j89kjm,"The thing is I was there when Pratchett announced it in public as they had just signed the paperwork. Terry and Rob were so happy to announce that it was going to be a faithful adaptation. That was a huge important point to him and why he was excited.

They have literally shat on what he wanted and agreed to. Sounds like they aren't even going to use the origina lstory lines either so both fans and non fans could enjoy the in-between adventures or those after the books. 

I was there back in Brighton in 2013 and even talked to his daughter about it. This is why she's so upset as it was his last project, his legacy but they shat on that."
1648,2020-10-10 11:51:42,j89kjm,"I wasn't hoping for anything from it.    There was never any way that a show could do Pratchett's writing justice.   So much of the depth, humor, and mind ending beauty of Pratchett's work is wrapped up in the voice of narration, in the man telling you the story rather than the story itself.   If they stayed true to the work, the show would have been terrible.   

I'll watch the show, and I'll give it an honest shot for being what it is, a show that has nothing to do with the books that now exist as part of the foundation of my soul.   

And I'll go into it hoping to find the show entertaining, because the first season of Dirk Gently was spectacular.   And it was spectacular because it was a show that had nothing to do with the books, but was created by a bunch of extremely talented people  who were moved by a book series but had their own story to tell, who were given a shit ton of money by bloodsucking producers because they knew the name Dirk Gently would attract an established fan base.   

But I'm not gonna be mad that it's not true to the original.  And I'm not gonna be too disappointed if it turns out not to be entertaining"
1649,2020-10-10 08:20:01,j89kjm,I’m now imagining Shirley from Community as Lady Sybil... I would be extremely happy with that!
1650,2020-10-10 01:38:13,j89kjm,"I know right!? Discworld has some absolutely awesome female characters. What I like about them is that they are awesome characters, who happen to be female, rather than awesome because they are female.

There seems to be a trend right now that female characters have to be perfect in every way, which just seems like a way to discourage woman who aren't outgoing, or have a perfect figure, or any number of things that make us all, male or female, feel bad about ourselves."
1651,2020-10-10 01:08:03,j89kjm,Exactly! And they probably think they are being 'feminist' by doing this.
1652,2020-10-10 09:28:04,j89kjm,"“Well, now Vetinari’s female, we don’t need *another* intellectually powerful female character. That would be unrealistic!”"
1653,2020-10-10 01:51:55,j89kjm,"There's been a bunch of speculation that they already had a Victorian supernatural police show planned, and basically bought the rights to slap the names on to the existing characters in the hopes of drawing in Discworld fans :-("
1654,2020-10-10 06:44:06,j89kjm,It's pretty clear no-one involved in this farce has read any of the books.

1657,2020-10-11 14:00:56,j89kjm,I hadn't until I remembered that Sybil wears wigs.
1658,2020-10-10 01:27:55,j89kjm,Omg... Yes! I have never thought about it till I read your comment but she would be perfect!
1659,2020-10-10 03:29:36,j89kjm,Interesting. I rather thought of Lady Sybil as looking more like Hyacinth Bucket (“Boo-KAY”) from *Keeping Up Appearances*.
1660,2020-10-10 03:40:02,j89kjm,To be fair Terry imagined Vimes way differently then basically any cover art drew him and made peace with it

1663,2020-10-10 03:58:10,j89kjm,Yes! She would have been fabulous in the role.
1664,2020-10-12 01:41:57,j89kjm,"Chummy and Sybil are actually eerily similar characters- large, ungainly, sweet yet steely women from wealthy homes who decide to embark on a helping vocation (nursing v dragon rescuing) and end up marrying police officers and having sons after difficult childbirths. It makes me wonder whether the Call the Midwife writers read Discworld (while Chummy was a real person her plot arc in the show is invented)."
1665,2020-10-10 09:25:37,j89kjm,"She's a great modern choice, ages back I used to think  Julie T. Wallace (from Lives and Loves of a She-Devil) would be great."
1666,2020-10-11 20:45:23,j89kjm,"yup good choice. perhaps a bit young, but 1000x better than who they chose."
1667,2020-10-10 02:14:56,j89kjm,"No matter how she may actually be in the books, I've always imagined Sybil as huge. Not in a fat sense, but like in general size. Like I'm picturing a 6'5'' 250 pound jacked lady.

Edit for typos"

1669,2020-10-10 01:08:31,j89kjm,"I can see that happening. However, this show is completely recharacterizing the characters. They might have the same name, but WHO they are is changed. Give me a gender bent and alternate ethnicity Vimes/Vetinari/Nobby/Sybil any day, as long as they stay true to who Sir Terry wrote them as."
1670,2020-10-10 09:10:38,j89kjm,The ethnicity of the actress is one of they few things about this adaptation that's *not* a problem. That should be made clear to likely critics at every opportunity.
1671,2020-10-10 10:12:47,j89kjm,"Litterially  couldn't  care about the colour of the actors.

Dont give a shit that vetinari  is a women, all fine with me.

Why is vines a punk rocker, why is sybil a bloody action hero."
1672,2020-10-10 05:27:20,j89kjm,"Dont worry, Cheery Littlebottom does not have a beard as well, and is taller than Angua, and the Patrician is female, and the list goes on.

1681,2020-10-10 10:50:45,j89kjm,I read that Amazon’s Lord of The Rings series is going to have sex and nudity because apparently all fantasy is either sex and nudity or House Wizzlebum Of the Griffintish School Of Magicarium (school motto: no transgender allowed)!
1682,2020-10-10 15:32:35,j89kjm,"Nope, according to what I’ve been reading, the show runners decided that STP’s work needed “updating”, and Colon and Nobby didn’t fit."

1684,2020-10-10 00:00:27,j89kjm,"But it's not just that. A bad adaptation, I wouldn't care about; they happen all the time. But even ignoring that, everything I read indicates that this show is fundamentally flawed. It would be bad if it were an original work, and being a poor adaptation of a beloved franchise just amplifies this."
1685,2020-10-10 06:49:57,j89kjm,"The missed opportunity is incredibly frustrating. Imagine an original Watch series, maybe with Rhianna writing. Assorted stories set in a recognisable Ankh-Morpork. Grisly crimes and mysteries solved by The Watch. New characters taking the lead, with familiar faces around the edges. It could've been brilliant."
1686,2020-10-10 08:38:01,j89kjm,Oh my God yes it's perfect
1687,2020-10-10 19:03:23,j89kjm,It didn't occur to me before your comment but Miranda Hart is now my mental canon Sybil.

1690,2020-10-10 06:45:17,j89kjm,"They seem to be downvoting you a bit much for a reasonable opinion.   


However, there is a bit more than a single trailer, and they suggest at the very least the fabulous characters are going to have a rehaul, and it doesn't seem to be an improvement.  
Human Cheery raised by dwarves.  
Jack Sparrow-like Vimes.  
Sybel is a thin rebel.  
Carcer is an anti-villain.  
Nobby and Colin haven't shown up at all.  
Female wizards.  
Members of the watch are in a rock band for some reason, charitably it's a reference to Soul Music, but still."
1691,2020-10-10 10:24:28,j89kjm,"It is more than just that though, you have the author's own daughter trying to distance this thing from his work, the character-mangling choices and a showrunner trying to take the credit for creating the work to such an extent that they didn't credit Sir Terry in a recent social media post about the show."
1692,2020-10-10 16:27:08,j89kjm,"I mean vines is wearing eyeliner, most of the characters  appear to be wearing eyeliner. That works for cherry perhaps.

It looks like what 14 yr old me though  was cool to look like... perhaps  this is all from the soul music episode."

1697,2020-10-10 07:32:06,j89kjm,Uh. I think the person you think is Angua is actaully Sybil. Angua is the short blond with the pixie cut. They also fucked up with her and carrot. Hes the new recruit. _She_ trains _him_.
1698,2020-10-10 01:36:04,j89kjm,What race? I'm confused.
1699,2020-10-10 09:44:03,j89kjm,"I disagree, she made me cringe pretty hard in this trailer but i suspect it's due to a lack of chemistry between the actors, bad writing and terrible directing because Anna Chancellor is a very good actress.

I hate the gender swapping personally. I'm usually against it but there are instances where it isnt terrible. In discworld it's just so *unnecessary*. It's filled to the brim with strong female leads"

Happy cake day btw."
1711,2020-10-10 06:40:02,j89kjm,"I don't think anyone who cared about stuff like that could enjoy discworld, its kind of self selecting to not have those sorts of fans. 

With books about female Wizards, male witches, an all female battalion disguised as men, age old enemies like trolls and dwarves becoming friends, golems developing their own identities and working for freedom, making a place in the world for creatures like goblins etc, treating everyone as an individual sapient being with their own personality, skills and values (I nearly just wrote human...) is effectively what they're all about.

The only reason that everyone cares about this change is because they've done it to make her an action character, rather than the unexpected skilled diplomat she is supposed to be."
1712,2020-10-10 08:11:27,j89kjm,"The thing is I can think of some black female actors who would fit the role. Octavia Spencer and Loretta Devine would definitely be able to convey the steel beneath the fluffy exterior. Given that they're both American and I haven't heard them give a crack at a posh English accent some black British actors should be considered - Lorna Gayle deserves a role like this. 

There is no excuse for this corruption of one of the best characters in discworld. Perhaps they think that the leading lady can't be fat and middle aged and a softy with a core of steel. Maybe a black fat middle aged leading lady would be enough to make their tiny little heads explode. They've got Angela to run around being a conventionally attractive action woman, they should just leave Sybil as she is, she's perfect."
1713,2020-10-10 06:46:01,j89kjm,"It bugs me that they changed some sex's, genders, and race but god forbid they show anyone old and/or ugly like nobby or battleship bosomed Lady Sybil.

1715,2020-10-10 11:46:00,j89kjm,"They have made some stupid decisions about race. In general, most characters could be any race, which helps for the other swaps but:

* I kind of feel that by making carcer black, we were forced into the more sympathetic character they're apparently going for as having the irredeemable criminal being a Black character would cause complaints in the current atmosphere. 
* Swapping the race of Keel but _not_ also swapping the race of Vimes is dumb when they're meant to be confusable for one or the other."
1716,2020-10-10 12:28:10,j89kjm,"That wouldn’t change anything about the plot and most people prefer not to be racist, especially vaguely literate people. 

But her being a young and skinny action hero completely ruins her arc, persona and multiple plot points and is a tiresome appeal to exactly the wrong kind of ‘badass’ they were going for. Let alone the negative message it pushes about ‘strong women’ fitting a very narrow Lara Croft sort of cliché. She’s meant to be older, larger, and extremely strong but in a different sense: imposing, matriarchal, and solid as a rock."
1717,2020-10-10 10:32:06,j89kjm,"If the actress looked like Amanatore in civ 6 (leader for Nubia), that'd be fine, the actress just indicates a big change in characterisation."

It would still have issues since female empowerment is a big part of sybil's character."

1721,2020-10-14 17:06:53,j89kjm,carrot was the only character that had to be white. the fact that everyone so so completely wrong in everyday is the issue. no one cares if they have a tan or not. this adaption is saddening.

I can't think of any moments in the books where his gender really matters in any way. Same for Sybil, I don't recall any reference to her skin colour, it's as important as whether they cast an actor with brown or blue eyes. But fundamentally re-writing the entire character just feels insulting, like she wasn't good enough the way she's always been."
1748,2020-10-10 07:26:06,j89kjm,"The one thing I really, really liked from the trailer is Lady Vetinari. Give me a more direct adaptation, and that could be a really fun take on the character."

1755,2020-10-10 00:25:26,j89kjm,"Exactly! They look at a big fanbase and think that they will consume substandard media. Cause “they are lucky we are even touching their nerd thing.” 

They need to take a page from Good Omens, a piece that is enjoyable for fans and people who’ve never seen it. That is how you make money, they branded and sold the hell out of Good Omens, script books, box sets, merchandise. It made more money than they spent on it!"
1756,2020-10-10 00:08:10,j89kjm,"Yeah, it made tons of money. That's all they really care about."

*edit* and when it all goes wrong they will blame everyone but themselves."
1758,2020-10-10 10:54:43,j89kjm,"Yeah, it plummeted after they ran out of source material and had to make things up themselves. That ought to tell other producers something about trying to play silly buggers with someone else's universe."
1759,2020-10-10 14:41:48,j89kjm,"That is super disappointing, I was really hoping that would be good! Ugh if you want sex and nudity find source material that has sex and nudity don’t add it into one of the greatest literary works of the English Language! 

I feel like at this point it is people trying to prove that fantasy isn’t just for children and instead of creating compelling and complex storylines they just take the easy way out."
1760,2020-10-10 22:42:19,j89kjm,Thats really all i needed to hear about this adaptation to know I'm not watching it.
1761,2020-10-10 00:04:02,j89kjm,"I think we agree, I was just saying that they are taking the names, and nothing else.  The reason the characters are who they are, the world they are in, just about everything is changed other than the names.

1765,2020-10-10 12:04:20,j89kjm,"No I’m aware that that is Angua (even if I initially thought it was supposed to be an original character). I didn’t look super closely at any pictures, and thought she looked way darker than Vimes and Carrot so assumed she was black/biracial (I noted this in a later comment). 

The real issue is the fact that fans can’t tell who each character is supposed to be without having to read an article about it."
1766,2020-10-10 02:03:47,j89kjm,"Actor race. Not because I’m racist, but because her being explicitly German is rather significant to what makes Angua Angua. 

Some good examples of race swapping are Domino in Deadpool and MJ in Spider-Man. Changing their race only goes skin deep, as at the end of the day they are still the same character. 

Angua however, comes from a family of basically Nazis, but isn’t herself racist. Since there’s no way they’re gonna have a family of black nazis, they’re gonna take away a defining part of Angua’s history. Plus the whole “bad hair day” thing doesn’t really apply when it’s that short.

Edit: I just realized that the actor that plays Angua isn’t black, making most of this moot, but I maintain that “bad hair days” aren’t nearly as bad with short hair."

I hope what you say is true about Discworld, I really do, because I love it even more than I love Trek, but the ability of humans to bury themselves in mountains of cognitive dissonance seems to be growing exponentially."

1785,2020-10-10 07:29:40,j89kjm,"Almost none of the race swaps bother me. Though there are compelling arguments about whether it’s a tiny bit racist to make Carcer Black, and that Keel should resemble Vimes enough that one can be mistaken for the other, but I’ll assume they just went a different direction there. I don’t see any problem making most of the cast any ethnicity at all. 

But yes, some of the gender swaps are *really* bugging me. Cheery presenting as non-binary when being her own version of a *woman* is key to her character, Lady Vetinari when our Vetinari contrasted with Vimes was a comment in itself on different kinds of masculinity, and Dibbler, well, that’s just stupid."

I'd have also preferred if they kept the character English, as there's something quintessentially English about Anathema as she's described in the book and it feels like changing that made her a whole different person. There are plenty of British actresses of colour who would easily fit the part; Angel Coulby would've been my choice (though she is prettier than I imagine Anathema)."
1818,2020-10-10 06:44:37,j89kjm,"Vetinari’s gender is extremely important to his character. 

It means nothing if he bucks all the gender norms of a traditional masculine leader if he’s a woman."
1819,2020-10-10 07:09:47,j89kjm,Oh my god how hilarious would it be if the classic book Sybil made classic book Vimes wear eyeliner to official events. He'd be ecstatic :P
1820,2020-10-10 08:08:44,j89kjm,"The issue is as some people have pointed out Vetinari is a subversion of traditional masculinity with focuses on the strongman imagery. All of it gets thrown under the bus if Vetinari is a woman as the message gets twisted. He's supposed to be the alternative to alpha male idea of tough, strong, brawn before brain masculinity. Discworld has enough compelling female characters such that Vetinari didn't need to be cannibalised so that the show creators could virtue signal. Prachett's critique of patriarchal masculinity is vital in our world imo."
1821,2020-10-12 19:41:06,j89kjm,I'm sure this show erased  evey character nuance Pratchett created and boiled them down to stereotypes.

1824,2020-10-10 01:24:26,j89kjm,"Good Omens also had Neil on the set going “the ghost of Terry Pratchett will punch you in the face if you even mention that again. Or I will.” But because of that it’s a very, very good example of keeping a balance between following the letter of a source work and keeping the spirit of one"
1825,2020-10-10 04:35:21,j89kjm,"The Witcher is also doing a decent job at striking this balance. They're changing some things for the show but not the heart and soul of the books or games. 

Whereas GoT showrunners just didn't give a shit about the heart and soul of /r/asoiaf they just wanted dragons and the Red Wedding."
1826,2020-10-10 00:52:06,j89kjm,"You know how much *more* they could have made if they stuck the landing? Merchandise sales are tanked. No one is reupping their sub to re-watch. The sequel and prequel series will flop, mark my words.

It's one thing to have a golden goose. The trick is to keep it alive and laying. HBO will get no more golden eggs from GoT."
1827,2020-10-10 14:46:10,j89kjm,I suppose it’s also a shortcut to building a fan base. GoT was a huge cultural phenomenon so releasing an epic fantasy and throwing sex at it is an easy / lazy way to appeal to GoT fans.

that probably the worst part of all of this, is than fans of the books can tell who's playing which character unless they are named on screen"
1831,2020-10-10 03:37:12,j89kjm,"German?  She's from Uberwald.    That's Pratchett's version of Transylvania.     

Uber = beyond   
Wald = forest   

Trans = across  
Sylvania = woods   

Seems sorta similar, right?

Wait, there's more! In medieval Latin, it was called Ultrasylvania.   
As a preposition, *ultra* can be used to mean *beyond*.  




Until your post inspired me to google it, I didn't know who was playing Angua.     
Now I'm almost tempted to attempt watching this train wreck.   

I'm mildly in love with Ingrid Bolsø Berdal.  She played Armistice in the first two seasons of Westworld, and she had those eyes that always seemed to promise violence.  I'll admit, it made me feel more than a little bit funny, inside."
1832,2020-10-10 03:20:28,j89kjm,"Okay, THAT was why I thought I was missing something. Agree with you on the short hair, the books certainly imply she has a lot of it."

I used to not really consider the fact that Vimes is a fictional character, because he legit was the most impactful role model in my life from when i was 10 to adulthood. Now, he feels like a friend, honestly. My memories of the books are so strong that the mental image of him smoking a rolly in a doorway out of the rain feels like an actual memory i lived.

Yeah, it's also very different, in many ways. Obviously, I am NOT calling this a faithful adaptation.

But you are being disingenuous by saying there aren't many obvious parallels"
1836,2020-10-10 15:23:04,j89kjm,"yeah...but it was a decent movie. That's the point.

1853,2020-10-10 08:56:18,j89kjm,"I guess I can *sort of* see the logic behind non-binary Cheery? It's easy to forget this now, but the whole ""dwarven gender politics"" arc grew out of a bit of observational humour about generic Tolkien dwarves.

In the '80s and '90s, if a fantasy story had a dwarf in it, he would inevitably be a hard-drinking, bearded axe warrior in platemail. What about the female dwarves, then? A common nerd joke was that, well, they exist - they just also have beards. Terry Pratchett took that and ran with it. It ultimately grew into a huge story arc, because Terry Pratchett was an incredible writer, but it started as a joke. We've mostly moved on from generic Tolkien dwarves in contemporary fantasy, so the writers might've worried that the joke doesn't really connect anymore.

Ultimately Cheery's story is about realizing and expressing a gender identity that society previously didn't allow for. You can still have that story if her gender is non-binary rather than female. It's the execution I worry about."
1854,2020-10-10 17:30:39,j89kjm,">  our Vetinari contrasted with Vimes was a comment in itself on different kinds of masculinity 

I cannot upvote this enough. Canon Vetinary was such a unique male character, being extremely capable and influential without being a tough, muscular action hero! I appreciated that about him so much.

 Meanwile the only reason for the genderswap is just ""Look, a woman in charge! Aren't we progressive?""

And it gets even worse with Dibbler, because first they made the character female, and then they had to make her *cooler*, because a woman can't be ""just"" a comic relief, because girl power. And now this character is suddenly the baddest gang leader in the city."
1855,2020-12-14 02:51:53,j89kjm,Why the fuck couldn't they make Vimes black and Carcer white then?

1859,2020-10-10 07:56:45,j89kjm,"I stopped watching a couple of episodes in. I know it's usually a very personal thing but a lot of decisions ran counter to what I felt was instrumental themes and plot points from the book. It wasn't too bad but you could tell it was going to go off the rails.

I was mostly salty about the casting of shadow and it made me sensitive to the rest. A lot of the book is spent indirectly characterizing Shadow as a mixed race of indeterminate origin. He could be Native American/Swedish but due to his mother's death he was robbed of his history, something a lot of americans have to grapple with. They had the perfect chance to cast people that normally never get cast in these kinds of roles but instead they picked an obviously black actor and Neil Gaiman sat and defended that decision."

If Hyacinth visits Sybil she would be all of a tiz becuase this a genuine LADY and a DUCHESS and she would be wearing her best dress and have bought a new hat and golves.

And Sybil would stomp in, wearing her grandmothers cardigan and some old boots, because she has just come in from worming the dragons. Hyacinth wouldn't know what to say because that isn't appropriate for a Lady, but then, on the otherhand, whatever a Lady decides is appropriate is appropriate.

Hyacinth will probably say something kinda mean and condescending at some point about someone, at which point Sybil will swiftly and frimly pull her up on it in a way no one really does, and Hyacinth will bristle for a bit. But then Sybil will carry on as if Hyacinth has just agreed to change her behaviour, and she won't be able to help but go with it, because no-one likes to *dissapoint Lady Ramkin.*"

1866,2020-10-10 09:26:57,j89kjm,Yeah Pete Postlewaite (Spielberg's favorite actor) was how Terry used to see Vimes. Liam Neeson was originally how Terry saw Carrot.

heck, yes. This is exactly how I always imagined him, and I didn't ever think of this actor, but it matches 100%.

1878,2020-10-10 07:08:42,j89kjm,"Hmm, I guess you're right. I actually never noticed how non-strongman he is. I guess it's not very noticeable when his presence alone overpowers everyone in the room."

While I'm sure there are many passages describing Vetinari as bucking the strongman type of leadership, I don't know that there's much about him that's gendered one way or another. Vetinari being a woman is one of the few changes I didn't consider at all - the character could be any gender and speak the vast majority of the exact lines from the book in the exact tone they were written. Like the race of most of the characters, it just isn't really an essential part of...them? I don't even know what pronoun you use when you're trying to refer to the non-gendered ideal of a gendered character. Haha, English guys, am I right?"

Hrm. Though he has been the only one to embody that particular archtype in the books - if he were switched that just leaves 'grizzled veteran' and 'naive earnest Hero' to go with the bumbling but good-hearted incompetence of Colon an Nobbs.

1883,2020-10-10 15:53:15,j89kjm,"And the Patrician's guards I remember being described as looking like and dressed as burly accountants/secretaries. Here we have traditional guards, not the Rock in a business suite."
1884,2020-10-10 00:38:11,j89kjm,"It’s because the main difference is GO was a labor of love and The Watch is a vanity project by someone who didn’t want to come up with their own idea and wanted to profit off an already existing fanbase.

Also yes. Several really nice adaptations would make me die a very happy person. Even just one book done properly would be nice.

Edit to clarify: while the adaptations we have already are incredibly lovely, and in some respects the casting is perfect. The production company that made them did not think that devoting time and resources into making was a worthwhile endeavor. (Didn’t think the fanbase was large enough) So you are left with a good product that lacks polish and finesse. Which is many ways is wonderful and part of their charms. 

I suppose when I say I was thinking of a *really* nice adaptation I was thinking of more of an anthology where all the casting is the same for every book, we see how the world is built and how it interconnects rather then treating them as stand alone pieces. That way they can be viewed as one reads the books either from start to finish or in order of series and nothing changes continuity wise. Every season is a book. 4-6 hour long episodes. We cast the best people for the job, not whoever is most famous or what we think will capture attention. 

Treating the series as what it is a universe. Like the MCU but obviously less toxic. (Yes the MCU in many ways has created a toxic environment or both fans and creators. Also the onset culture is incredibly dangerous, as the look of what they want is often placed above the actors well-being)"

1908,2020-10-10 15:07:47,j89kjm,"I’ve only recently discovered the Disc, I’ve been reading the books in (I think) publication order.

Vimes is probably my favorite character across the series, with Nanny Ogg and Granny Weatherwax tied for strong second.

And to think it all started with a hapless tourist, an amagical wizzard, and a murderous steamer trunk."
1909,2020-10-10 08:56:30,j89kjm,Vimes is white. Keel is black. Go figure.
1910,2020-10-10 09:05:42,j89kjm,"In the books, no-one knew what Keel looks like, save for Ned Coates. Keel and Vimes don't look a like but Vimes ends up with a scar and eye patch which is what most people remember, and after the events of the book, people remember the face of vimes as Keel. It's how Terry deals with memory and the mind. It gets a tad zen."
1911,2020-10-10 08:39:22,j89kjm,"All dwarfs present the appearance of being men. The assumption for dwarfs in a relationship is they know what sex the other is

The whole point of Cherry is she realised she could display feminine traits (sequins on her axe, a skirt, etc..) and still remain a dwarf (although she keeps the beard because not having a beard is undwarfish).

It creates a theme where female dwarfs seek to acknowledge their gender and traditional dwarfs seek to stop them.

I'm sure someone thought they were clever updating it to non binary but missed the point entirely. Pratchett wrote satire he set up an exaggerated example which supports LGBT and womens rights.

The worst thing is the dwarf traditionalists would have loved Cherry reporting as non binary because that was what they were trying to enforce.

Its these kinds of changes which tell me whoever made the series never cared about the discworld books."
1912,2020-10-10 11:28:17,j89kjm,"She is trying to present male at first but it never really sat right with her and when she got to the city she embraced her feminine identity, despite how scandalous it was for dwarfs to present as anything but male. The sexes are mostly indistinguishable when they want to be, even to other dwarves."
1913,2020-10-10 09:12:05,j89kjm,"Female gang leader that goes by Throat, the most powerful informant in the city. No joke."
1914,2020-10-10 09:01:37,j89kjm,"Judging from the rest, he’s probably a super-rich philanthropist who runs a gourmet soup-kitchen or some shit"
1915,2020-10-10 10:10:04,j89kjm,"Female (okay with that) con artist/underworld King with a gang of gun wielding henchmen.
It think those henchmen are supposed to be Goblins?"
1916,2020-10-10 13:54:07,j89kjm,"Yep. It’s not even the gender swap so much there, because there are Dhblah and Dibhala in other books, indicating that any place with a sufficient population density has *A* Dibbler, so sure, some of them might be women. But the leader of an underground gang and secret informant? Dibbler sells sausages between hare brained get rich quick schemes. Dibbler does not lead anything."
1917,2020-10-10 11:07:32,j89kjm,"I mean, *kinda.* But it’s also kind of the opposite. Dwarves didn’t *have* a gender binary before city dwarves started wearing lipstick and armored skirts. They all presented the same, it’s just in a way other species viewed as male. I think that puts her in more the trans category."
1918,2020-10-11 13:56:14,j89kjm,Except that dwarves presenting as asexual / non-binary was the tradition Cheery was rebelling against in the original...
1919,2020-12-14 07:13:06,j89kjm,"Because they still couldn’t be confused for one another realistically, it’s nothing to do with race and everything to do with looking the same"
1920,2020-10-10 03:54:29,j89kjm,"Nobody cares what type of human you are, just that you are, in fact, human.  And not from Klatch, unless you can make a good curry. And those Uberwald people have some funny ways, if you catch my meaning.  Or XXXX, they're a funny lot.  


If you're from select parts of the Sto Plains, you're probably not really alright, but close enough for these general purposes."
1921,2020-10-10 08:12:11,j89kjm,"I understand the issue and I guess being unaffected by the issue plus being a fan of both Gaiman and Fuller (with a craving for both AG lore and something to remind of Hannibal) and having read a lot of Internet discussions on the casting already  left me ok with the casting. 

I'd say you're just lucky then you stopped before they spent a whole season on how Mr. Ibis does autopsies and kills black people."
1922,2020-10-10 12:10:24,j89kjm,"I watched the whole first season, and really, Mr. Nancy is the highlight."
1923,2020-10-10 08:08:33,j89kjm,"Only if it proves itself, and to do that you have to risk putting it on the air.

Better to use something known. That way, it is more likely to succeed.

Plus, if it fails, you can say things like ""the fanbase wasn't big/supportive enough"", or anything else that lays the blame anywhere but with the people who gave the show the green light."
1924,2020-10-10 16:16:51,j89kjm,Liam Neeson  is interested. I always thought  a bit more like a young  arny
1925,2020-10-10 21:13:03,j89kjm,In my head I always imagined Vimes as a Christopher Eccleston type (not dissimilar to Pete Postlethwaite) and would ADORE an adaption with him in.
1926,2020-10-20 14:00:55,j89kjm,"That sounds right.

Thanks!"
1927,2020-10-10 04:31:49,j89kjm,Absolutely
1928,2020-10-22 10:39:30,j89kjm,"That is a fabulous picture, looks like you were both having a great time."
1929,2020-10-10 07:15:21,j89kjm,"That's fair, I guess I have a pretty concrete picture of her in my head. The only other casting that didn't work for me was Adam's parents. Having grown up in rural 90s England, the whole Tadfield setting is pretty vivid in my mind's eye, so anything that directly opposes my assumptions about it is more jarring to me than it might be to others."
1930,2020-10-10 09:35:59,j89kjm,"strong by not being strong. He also doesn't leave the room, others leave his presence (do not let me detain you) yet this Patrician wanders off to allow for a rude gesture joke. Not very Haveolock like."
1931,2020-10-10 16:18:47,j89kjm,There was a women behind him the entire time anyway as we learn in the later books.
1932,2020-10-10 09:55:50,j89kjm,"If you’ve labeled Vetinari “the cold analytic chessmaster”, you’ve already missed a substantial amount of his characterization.

He’s an ultra-slim, soft-spoken effeminate man. He owns a toy dog he pampers the hell out of, and openly flirts with men. Even if you don’t want to apply labels to him, Vetinari bucks the standard depictions of a masculine leader."
1933,2020-10-10 12:23:29,j89kjm,"See Susan Sto Helit could easily play the sort of role a female Patrician is gonna play. Or heck there's Sybil right there, the perfect reimagination of a woman in power changing the system by effecting change from within but of course they turned her into a skinny axe wielding action figure. They fundamentally misunderstood Discworld, they just want to check boxes while missing the nuance with which sir Terry portrayed them."
1934,2020-10-10 16:23:25,j89kjm,"Eh I dunno, the patrician is kinda the archetypal evil tyrant, only he is a good tyrant as is kinda played on in the books, he is between  mr burns, snape and king Solomon.

So if it is played by a woman  of course she could come of ass a cold calculating  bitch as vetinary  is a cold calculating bastard.

The important  detail is what he/she is calculating."
1935,2020-10-10 12:30:18,j89kjm,"To me the importance of Vetinari is in the fact that he stands in negation of recent crop of strongman leaders around the world who project themselves as being in charge by way of bluster, boast and so on. Vetinari stands in stark contrast to that, he's got his unsavory sides but in a strictly political role he's an interesting take on a ruler who rules not by force but by way of compromises and using his intellect. The thing is the message of a female Patrician is not too different from what Lady Sybil has in the books, someone who makes changes in the society by writing letters and not by waving a sword around, but they already destroyed that in the show."
1936,2020-10-11 05:19:36,j89kjm,"Going Postal?

Colour of Magic?

Hogfather?"
1937,2020-10-10 08:23:15,j89kjm,"David tennant would be an excellent vetinari. I loved him as the doctor but literally every other character I’ve seen him be has been at some level evil or at the least pragmatically distant to humanity. 

I’ve always kinda hated orlando bloom, so I think he’d be a decent rincewind because rincewind is so utterly ... rincewind."
1938,2020-10-10 08:21:18,j89kjm,"I hadnt considered that, but that would be amazing. Tennant as Ricewind...superb choice. 

Vimes is always Charles Dance for me."
1939,2020-10-10 22:13:26,j89kjm,"Oh my goodness, my favorite actor playing my favorite character??? I think it would be too much, I'd die of the vapors just from watching the trailer."
1940,2020-10-11 01:05:49,j89kjm,"Daniel Radcliffe would be an amazing Rincewind. If you don't believe me, watch him in Miracle Workers."
1941,2020-10-10 07:59:58,j89kjm,"I liked the Hogfather, I didn't like Going Postal, the Colour of Magic was alright."
1942,2020-10-12 22:33:58,j89kjm,I haven't read or seen American Gods. Is it worth it?
1943,2020-10-10 05:07:14,j89kjm,"I always pictured Uberwald as being the Hollywood vintage horror movie version of Transylvania, and the accent as being pretty much Bela Lugosi."
1944,2020-10-10 03:59:13,j89kjm,"Ah, well.  I *can* watch that.   Interesting that the new show's actor didn't show up when I searched *the watch angua*."
1945,2020-10-10 07:47:09,j89kjm,"I hate to break it to you, but I think you gave Angus confused with Sybil. Angua in this is a short woman with blonde hair. “Sybil” has been cast as a stunning, black, young action hero."
1946,2020-10-10 08:15:36,j89kjm,I would argue that Überwald is equally parts german and eastern europe.
1947,2020-10-10 19:44:53,j89kjm,Huh. You are correct.
1948,2020-10-10 15:31:31,j89kjm,"That's a stupid metaphor. The manure here is just your unwillingness to accept any variation to the original recipe. Call this instead a chocolate cake, but with mint in it, and a vanilla frosting, and cherries....it's obviously a different cake, even if it read the original recipe.

And...it may yet still be a horrible cake. It might be disgusting, or it might just be...different. And you are welcome still to prefer the original cake. I will too. But it may still be a good cake in its own right."
1949,2020-10-10 16:07:50,j89kjm,"I mean in old man alcoholic  bean man kinda way yeah.

Probably  not  as an aging punk rocker who never grew out of puberty."
1950,2020-10-16 08:16:11,j89kjm,"That's what I mean. She is awesome, and doesn't need to be replaced by a thin actor to be sexy."
1951,2020-10-10 09:16:01,j89kjm,That is fun. And Farang is still a word that Thai people use for European foreigners but I’d never made the connection
1952,2020-10-10 13:32:12,j89kjm,I remember seeing this in one of the original Sherlock Holmes books and doing a double take!
1953,2020-10-15 15:21:37,j89kjm,Enterprise too
1954,2020-10-10 09:13:32,j89kjm,"That's so stupid it hurts.

Just make both of them black if it matters so much to these idiots, that would be way better than having them a different race."
1955,2020-10-10 09:28:38,j89kjm,"Not really. Keel's body was left in Vimes' place when he returned. I think people would have noticed if he had changed skin colour. Vetinari noticed a difference, but not so much as to comment."
1956,2020-10-10 16:09:57,j89kjm,"I mean they have the chance to tell that story, perhaps  she does start like that?

I mean dwarfs basically  are non binary, it's just their non binary  is very male to humans."
1957,2020-10-10 09:25:58,j89kjm,Oh I think I'm going to cry
1958,2020-10-10 21:06:30,j89kjm,".... Just, what?!"
1959,2020-10-10 10:05:05,j89kjm,"Donald trump caricature  mark my words.

Eh that actually  may be too clever"
1960,2020-10-10 11:08:12,j89kjm,"I'm currently reading The Truth and... No. Just no. Dibbler is the guy who reverts to selling sausages inna bun because his money making schemes keep falling through, not a gang leader."
1961,2020-10-10 16:18:33,j89kjm,"and if he is, it's probably best to abandon ship"
1962,2020-12-14 07:41:51,j89kjm,"Carcer isn't supposed to look like Vimes though. Keel is.

Edit: personally would be more ok with Vimes and Keel both being black than the one of each thing they've gone with."
1963,2020-10-10 04:33:38,j89kjm,"Also I'll have no truck with those Agateans. Gods know what they get up to with their funny foods and disgusting heathen rituals, I'm sure."
1964,2020-10-10 23:30:28,j89kjm,"Well, they fired him, so rest assured you don't need to watch any more!"
1965,2020-10-11 10:51:09,j89kjm,"That's how a lot of people thought of him. Terry said early on he didn't have that sort of physique, but we all have out ideas of how they should look."
1966,2020-10-22 11:25:37,j89kjm,We really were.  It was just before he stole my beer :-)
1967,2020-10-10 10:02:36,j89kjm,"I mean, it sounds like you're upset the character isn't being presented as an implied gay or sexually ambiguous man. I get that, if that's an important aspect of the character to you. But I don't think it's an absolutely essential aspect, or even near the most important aspect, of the character."
1968,2020-10-12 15:56:12,j89kjm,"> and openly flirts with men

Huh? When?"
1969,2020-10-11 09:22:13,j89kjm,"Those are really wonderful adaptations. I was talking more about budget and production value and having anthology would be great so we can really see how each story interconnects. Sorry I probably wasn’t clear enough.

The main issue is not that these are poor adaptations but rather that they fail to rise to the stakes and true meaning behind the books. Mostly because they were made at a time when fantasy was directed mainly at children. People believe that children cannot understand complex themes so the gloss over them and hint at them so the adults catch it but not children. Mostly because they believe that parents don’t want to have in-depth conversations with their kids. It’s really about how some of the adaptations are style over substance.

No the books really are not that subtle."
1970,2020-10-12 01:47:41,j89kjm,"A younger David Tennant could have been a FANTASTIC Moist, except that he's not bland-looking enough- Moist is supposed to be able to blend into the background."
1971,2020-10-10 09:21:54,j89kjm,"Interesting, because Dance played Vetinari and I can't see him as anyone else"
1972,2020-10-10 12:29:18,j89kjm,Charles Dance *looks* absolutely nothing at all like the Vetinari in my head. But he got the voice and mannerisms exactly right.
1973,2020-10-11 01:09:27,j89kjm,"Oh no I agree. He does manic and panic very very well (saw Miracle Workers, that was fun, but also saw *Guns Akimbo* recently). He just wasn't part of The Good Omens cast so I didn't think of it at the time."
1974,2020-10-11 01:13:30,j89kjm,Oh I just jumped saw someone below mention Orlando Bloom and decided to comment with my pick haha.
1975,2020-10-10 22:16:27,j89kjm,"I loved Hogfather. Going Postal was okay. The only good parts of CoM were Sean Astin and Tim Curry. I weep at what they did to Rincewind. Sir David Jason makes a wonderful Albert, but there was no good reason to do Rincewind so dirty by aging him forty years."
1976,2020-10-12 23:08:36,j89kjm,"If you've read Good Omens and liked it, you potentially like Pratchett and Gaiman both - their collaboration was pretty epic. I adore Gaiman's work. It's radically different from Pratchett, but both are a couple of the best authors that exist in my humble opinion.

I liked American Gods very much. It plays with the idea of Old World gods existing in America, and the conflict between old and new gods. And it is, in a small way, a loving celebration of America by Gaiman - not in a flag-waving patriotic fake way, but a celebration (in passing) of culture.

But I love all his work. Neverwhere was my first of his novels, and I highly recommend it. Anansi Boys is also great - I'd read that after American Gods. The Sandman graphic novels are more brilliant storytelling."
1977,2020-10-10 16:29:20,j89kjm,"It is, but also nazi werewolfs"
1978,2020-10-10 11:59:20,j89kjm,"No I’ve only seen the pictures of Angua and Vimes and Angua and Carrot. I didn’t think that was Angua until I heard she was. And because of her darker skin (in comparison to Vimes and Carrot) I thought she was black or biracial. 

I maintain that the fact I couldn’t identify the character is a big problem."
1979,2020-10-10 11:51:25,j89kjm,And I’d agree with you. But the Von Uberwald’s are pretty specifically German
1980,2020-10-10 16:41:10,j89kjm,"They have changed the very souls of the characters.

Realise no one here is upset about gender, race, sexuality.

It's the soul of the characters  that matter."

1982,2020-10-10 16:09:08,j89kjm,"Would have zero problem with vimes being black, as long as he doesn't  look like a Reject from a 90s nu rock band."
1983,2020-10-10 09:57:04,j89kjm,"I hadn't thought of that aspect but thinking on it now, post death, most who knew him was dead, it was warfare. How Terry dealt with memories of stuff from years ago was chemical (like borrowing) the physical affects the ethereal. With the timey-wimey stuff possible different memories could compete, can't recall exactly which book goes into this deeper, Thief of Time maybe."
1984,2020-10-10 21:09:53,j89kjm,"Rat onna stick, sausage inna bun, Dibblers are sleazy salespeople, not gang leaders! My favourite part of my username here is occasionally getting ""rat onna stick?"" replies in the wild. Dibbler should be an easy funny character."
1985,2020-10-11 13:54:57,j89kjm,You forgot about anti-dragon equipment (refunds only given in person).
1986,2020-10-12 15:38:16,j89kjm,"And if he ran a gang, it would be one of Mary Kay salespeople, with really strong arm sales tactics."
1987,2020-10-10 23:28:07,j89kjm,"There can be no greater indicator that an endeavor is doomed than a Dibbler being in any way part of the leadership.

Or even involved, if we're being honest."
1988,2020-12-14 07:56:22,j89kjm,"Shit you’re right, i’m an idiot and got Carcer and Keel mixed up.  Agree with your edit too."
1989,2020-10-16 03:23:36,j89kjm,"Well, that's strange because Carrot is told to be called Carrot because of his physique that he got while working with dwarves and red hair. I always thought that was about having wide shoulders..."
1990,2020-10-10 10:14:47,j89kjm,">It sounds like you’re upset the character isn’t being presented as an implied gay or sexually ambiguous man.

No, I don’t think Vetinari is gay or sexually ambiguous. He has a girlfriend in the books. It is made explicitly clear he is either heterosexual or bi at most.

The significance of Vetinari is that he’s not bound to any of your traditional trappings. He is the supreme leader, and he can express himself however he wants to.

When you make him an angry bitch lecturing Vimes to show that she’s a “strong woman”, you denigrate the entire concept of the character.

And you can still do strong women- discworld is fully of an insane variety of them. But none of them are offensive stereotypes like FemVet is."
1991,2020-10-10 09:57:21,j89kjm,Agree.  I got into Discworld shortly after hearing of PTerry's death (since Discworld is basically non existing where I live) and decided to start by watching Going Postal get an idea on the whole thing. Dance's Vetinari had such a pose and charisma i was mildly intimidated by him and the scene when he Looks at Moist gave me a full The Eyebrow experience.  If he only was a bit gaunter and with black hair he would have been perfect (ironic they didn't dye him because otherwise he looked too evil)
1992,2020-10-10 22:14:43,j89kjm,"Hey it's okay. Have you read The Color of Magic? Sometimes even Vetinari doesn't look like Vetinari.

I also kid, CoM is my favorite book."
1993,2020-10-10 12:10:08,j89kjm,"I completely agree with your last comment. None of these characters have remotely recognisable personalities from what I’ve seen.

I’m just mentally filing the show in a box marked “do not touch”"
1994,2020-10-10 12:35:44,j89kjm,Angua's family? yeah. I was talking about the region in general.
1995,2020-10-10 11:12:27,j89kjm,I think you're tying yourself in knots to explain it. I'm certain Pratchett intended them to look a little similar at least. This series probably won't even do the whole time travel Night Watch stuff. I imagine Keel will appear in flashbacks.
1996,2020-10-11 08:47:51,j89kjm,Activly involved. If someone voluntreered a Dibbler to take part it is not yet time to run.
1997,2020-12-14 07:58:45,j89kjm,I'm pissed off how they've dealt with Carcer too though tbh. He's not a sympathetic character and I resent them trying to make him into one just because they cast the character as black.
1998,2020-10-16 09:49:47,j89kjm,"Yes he had wide shoulders and a tapered physique. That's why he got called Carrot. Not a He-Man doll though, like AhNold. Terry said he had something like Liam Neeson in mind."
1999,2020-10-10 10:25:44,j89kjm,"You know, I think we just have vastly different opinions on both the book character *and* the presentation in the short clip we saw."
2000,2020-10-11 10:54:10,j89kjm,"I'm not, just fitting the way Terry uses memory in his books to this aspect. In Night Watch LuTze explains how memories work to Vimes. I cannot guess what Terry intended, but the stuff in the books explains it. I was surprised by the casting of Keel, but it's not incongruous, much."
2001,2020-10-11 08:49:16,j89kjm,"True. If a Dibbler is complaining, it's probably okay."
2002,2020-10-29 01:30:17,j89kjm,">Liam Neeson

He doesn't seem like someone to be remembered/nicknamed for having wide shoulders. Pretty balanced figure."
2003,2020-10-10 14:47:14,j89kjm,"And this, my friends, is what a civilised debate looks like"
2004,2020-11-01 18:16:19,j89kjm,"He was a tall, athletic figure, Terry said he was roughly what he thought of as Carrot. Liam was a boxer and had wide shoulders when he was younger."

When I start to get anxiety just focus on your breathing (in 10 secs out 7 seconds) and listen to something comforting. Sometimes I will just put on the sound of rain and breathe. Also taking a nice shower can help too. I love candlelight showers. Don't be afraid to let others know you're having anxiety issues as nothing is better than having someone there for you to walk you through it. I don't know if you have a cat or not but cats are incredible spiritual energy and my kitty knows how to pull me through an anxiety attack. I've never taken a heroic dose of LSD though so this is really coming from someone who does 1-2 tabs and maybe some shrooms with it. Oh one more thing, comedy! If you can handle it put on a Netflix comedy special! I recommend Tom Segura. I hope this helps!"

- Nicki Minaj defends Lady Gaga

After the South African group Die Antword's ' Fatty Boom ' video scandal, Nicki Minaj came out to Gaga's defense after a parody that was made by the group. In an interview for an English magazine Nicki Minaj was questioned:

-''' What do you think about Die Antwoord's new video? ''
-' ' A shit completely, I saw it on the same day of the premiere, I saw myself painted on a wall with several of my fellow artists and we were labeled that we were a demon or some shit like that, when I saw Gaga I was very angry because I felt that he they wished death and I said how the fuck can you mess with an artist as big as Gaga, Youtube shouldn't allow those shit videos. ''

2035,2020-10-09 19:18:27,j83o36,"Watkin Tudor Jones has always wanted respect. I think that’s a prime reason they became the moral less Die Antwoord seeking monetary success and attention instead. But in their short by Harmony Korinne for example, they talk about how no one takes them seriously. They want to be taken seriously and they want to be respected and that’s why they’ve went to such great lengths to keep this up. There’s two conversations - the mainstream would bring them up as villains and respond to their disses which only serves to verify their relevance. But I feel separating the artist from the person, they also are qualified to be talked about academically because of their artistic contributions to pop culture/rap."

Been there since 5:55 am the 15th. I don’t even know who to call about it, I tried Pitney Bowes and they don’t have an option for it that works. Dumb."
2111,2020-12-18 21:46:58,jqrvfi,Oh no so sorry this is happening to you :( they did say there might be delays in shipping I think mine came in a few weeks as well! But I really think it was worth the wait. The bras are really soft and comfy and I think the sizing chart is super accurate! Good luck I hope your order comes in soon :)
2112,2020-12-18 21:19:26,jqrvfi,"Yep and calling savage they just say they can’t do anything about it. Or they’ll keep lying to delay. They told me if I didn’t get it Monday they would cancel. Contact them Monday they continuously say they can do anything about.

The website literally says 5-9 business days for shipping. I’ve never seen a shipping service jump from 9-20 days out of delay. At least not the typical ones and I ship hundreds of packages a week myself with UPS and USPS"
2113,2020-12-20 18:25:57,jqrvfi,Most other people have said the quality ended up being pretty terrible and as someone with triple D’s my expectations are low now haha.
2114,2020-12-22 00:48:43,jqrvfi,"Got my package today, none of it fits or looks good, and their idea of a DDD cup size is waaaaay off"
2115,2020-12-22 07:12:15,jqrvfi,Aw IM REALLY SORRY 😭 don’t know why this is happening. Really sucks when a company doesn’t live up to its expectations! Hope you find good bras soon! I’ve been wanting to try adore me! They have cute styles and the plus size section looks great too! Love a company that can do both :)
2116,2021-02-15 02:35:33,jqrvfi,"I know this is old, but bras from adore me suck. The lace cups are thin, the straps are the same regardless if you have bigger breasts, and the band around has minimal support. Tbh, every thing looks good on the website, but it really doesn't fit how you think it should."
2117,2021-01-14 07:39:33,jqrvfi,Yes I’ve been looking into them and third love!
2118,2021-02-25 07:44:24,jqrvfi,Aw dang do you have a store you like to buy from them?
2119,2021-02-25 16:34:01,jqrvfi,"I used to buy from Linda the Bra Lady, but they're doing some rebranding and now they carry only expensive bra's and have a smaller variety of brands. I just got my order from Savage X Fenty and I like the quality. It's not as sturdy as the brands that's been around longer, but they still hold me up well. 

The material of the bra I got from Adore me was a stretchy bathing suit material, but the two I got from Fenty feels normal and holds close to my body. And when I jump, the bra doesn't move out of place.

I'm still looking for more brands. I wish there were more underwear brands and women who review them unsponsored!"

You clearly do, and that is fine, but many people prefer women who are thin-ish but have don't have such a strait/flat body. Jessica Biel and Charlize Theron both clearly work hard on their body, but it is a bit of an unnatural look. Adele's body looks very natural and she definitely does not need abs. I agree with OP that she has a better body than both the women you mentioned."

Adele has a very natural and healthy looking body. Some people find that attractive. Nobody is claiming that she has a flat stomach, perky tits, and a six pack. Nobody is saying that her body is your preference."

2191,2020-11-08 14:31:00,jqaa9s,"There's a sentiment that I've seen artists express in interviews over the years - something along the lines of 'you spend the first 20 years of your life writing your first album, and then 6 months writing your second'. It's pretty interesting that fans want expansive creative growth, but also want that growth to fit into the contracted album cycles. Like, Folklore can probably be framed as the growth between reputation and now, but it's just that artists can't take as many years as they like to release new music, so there are always going to be those 'in-between' albums that aren't as evolved as we expect (i.e. Lover). I think it's just impossible to want new music/'era's' every 18-24 months while also expecting groundbreaking stuff everytime"
2192,2020-11-08 14:43:23,jqaa9s,This first artist that comes to mind is Usher. “Confessions” is his masterpiece! But none of his work after that was able to stand next to it and I went from an Usher fan to a casual listener.
2193,2020-11-08 12:40:26,jqaa9s,Is “artistic growth” really that important if the music is great?
2194,2020-11-08 20:33:13,jqaa9s,"Katy is the biggest guilty party of doing this. I liked Smile, but pretty much all of those songs could've easily been on Prism or Witness. Her inability to evolve as an artist is why she's where she's at today. 

People seem to overall like Positions, but Ariana needs her next album to take some sort of new step."
2195,2020-11-08 13:35:54,jqaa9s,"For my $.02 on *positions,* I will simply quote Pitchfork

>*Positions* doesn’t broaden Grande’s sound the way her past few albums have, and it isn’t buoyed by a heroic anthem, like “no tears left to cry,” or guided by a specific mission, like how “thank u, next” honored her relationship history. The record resonates partly because it doesn’t weld grand statements out of living with trauma; it narrows in on the wobbly path of pleading with yourself, the begging and bargaining of healing."
2196,2020-11-08 14:27:37,jqaa9s,"I feel like a lot of artists that are specifically geared towards teenagers suffer from diminished returns, since it's all about repeating an often dated formula, and having artistic interest is the last thing on their people's minds. Also, people who were signed, or only broke through due to a specific trend, but..... trends only last a few years."
2197,2020-11-08 12:57:44,jqaa9s,"Lover, Taylor's most pointless endeavor. If folklore were released after reputation, it would have achieved a similar result of getting her out of that ""angry dark phase"" and showing her newfound perspective about love, womanhood, politics, songwriting, etc. Minus having to subject us to ME! and YNTCD

Going off on a tangent because I have to insert her on everything: Beyoncé almost experienced this when she released Run The World as lead single. It's 2010 aka the peak of the gagafication of pop, and people assumed that Bey would really embrace electropop (sasha fierce dabbled a little bit on it) like every pop girl that era. As it turned out, 4 was an excellent contemporary RnB album with an electropop lead single"
2198,2020-11-08 18:42:13,jqaa9s,"All artists have a peak, so diminishing returns are inevitable. However, if an artist changes their sound, it makes the return interesting, even if it has a 50/50 chance of being pretty bad. An artist making a project that’s similar to the previous and being weaker than the 1st one is the worst tho - there’s not much to talk about."
2199,2020-11-08 14:39:49,jqaa9s,"Big Time Rush's final album 24/seven felt like the group going through the motions. BTR is a certified classic and Elevate felt like the group going in a different direction, but 24/seven felt like an hour of average BTR material"
2200,2020-11-08 20:21:25,jqaa9s,"It's certainly possible that releasing too quickly doesn't just lower the possible 'objective' quality, but even the perception of it too. I'd say a lot of Future/trap stuff suffers from an overwhelming amount of releases. People like to get hyped up for new releases.

It is important to think about a discography as a whole though. Does Positions move the needle? Some would argue no (though I personally think it does). But when we're 2-3 albums removed from it, I think we're going to be happy Ari has a uniquely quarantine rnb record. It might not be a masterpiece or a complete departure from sounds she explored earlier, but it fleshes out a particular vibe and cements a side of Ari in a whole project."
2201,2020-11-09 05:11:04,jqaa9s,"Revival was the album that almost destroyed Eminem's credibility as a serious rap artist. He had been moving in a more pop direction since Recovery, but he went completely overboard with this album. The production sounds like it belongs on an Imagine Dragons or Chainsmokers album, there are almost no rap features and an overreliance on pop features, some songs just sound completely out of place/directionless, and Eminem himself gave the worst performance of his career. Worse than Encore because at least there, he was on drugs. What was his excuse on Revival? 

Had he not released Kamikaze, I don't know where his career would be now."
2202,2020-11-09 04:31:32,jqaa9s,Speak for yourself. *Unapologetic* is a great album that aged amazingly.
2203,2020-11-10 01:24:26,jqaa9s,Future Nostalgia  *cough
2204,2020-11-08 17:35:36,jqaa9s,"a variation of it is ""you have a lifetime to write your debut, 2 years to follow it up"""
2205,2020-11-08 18:41:50,jqaa9s,I know there’s contracts but I wish artists simply took longer to release albums. I rather have quality albums every 4 years. Than albums every years with the tired same old thing
2206,2020-11-08 19:42:52,jqaa9s,"Things like contracts and time constraints definitely do contribute to diminishing returns, like OP said with Rihanna’s albums.

My theory is that Ariana released Positions so she could fulfill her original contract with Republic and negotiate a new one. Contracts are usually 6 albums and she probably realized that it’s probably better to get on that sooner rather than later. I’m not saying Positions is a throwaway project by any means, but that’s probably why it’s less realized."
2207,2020-11-08 14:59:42,jqaa9s,"I think it's very important and separates good artists from great artists. Imagine if The Beatles stuck with the sound they had on Rubber Soul for the rest of their career. Or if Bowie stuck with the Ziggy Stardust sound. Or Kanye stuck with The College Dropout sound. They'd still be seen as good artists, but not the transcendent ones they are today. If you keep rehashing the same sound on each album, eventually people will lose interest, even if the quality of the music doesn't necessarily change."
2208,2020-11-08 15:31:50,jqaa9s,"Yes. Best example of this is Bryson Tiller, Trapsoul was a fantastic debut and his sophomore album was like reheated songs from his Trapsoul era. The music was ""great"" but showed no artistic growth so it actually made the music ""suck"". 

To me artist growth is just the artist doing something new/different from their last project. Like it sucks to hear a 2.0 of any artist album (besides an actual B side album) or a sound where it's like they're retrogressing."
2209,2020-11-08 13:21:21,jqaa9s,"Maybe it might not be important. But imo, artistic growth has a lot to do with great music. It goes to show the range and capability of an artist. Sure, it doesn’t have to sound extraordinarily different, but doesn’t mean doing something we’ve heard many times before equals to great music. Even classical music has a lot of variations although it might sound the same, but I digress."
2210,2020-11-08 18:21:16,jqaa9s,"Yeah, to an extent. If an artist doesn’t really change their sound, it’s easy to get burnt out on them. AC/DC are the classic example of this; while they may make badass hard rock, that’s all they do and it makes them a stale act, even if they do it well"
2211,2020-11-09 11:25:54,jqaa9s,"Ugh this. Okay positions is nothing new for Ariana but damn safety net, POV, off the table and just like magic are AMAZING. I got some 10/10 songs I literally can’t complain"
2212,2020-11-08 19:11:22,jqaa9s,"Not every album has to be a huge innovation over the prior. However, if not enough new is brought to the table, there is going to be diminished interest. I think it's less important to analyze ""artistic growth"" from one album to the next, but more important as a career trajectory: where did an artist start vs where did they end up? If there's minimal growth over the course of multiple albums, then a fall from the public eye is almost inevitable."
2213,2020-11-09 00:31:27,jqaa9s,I don't really think of Ariana as an artist geared towards teenagers though?? She has a large teenage fanbase but she definitely isn't a teen pop artist
2214,2020-11-08 14:22:05,jqaa9s,">gagafication

This concept, I'm here for it."
2215,2020-11-08 16:50:30,jqaa9s,I think Lover's problems were less about diminishing returns and more about Taylor focusing too much on making commercial success and pandering to the GP. ME! as a lead single just screams poor attempt to replicate Shake It Off's chart success to me.

2217,2020-11-08 16:04:06,jqaa9s,"I get that ME! and YNTCD was a very pointless endeavor. But, I feel she showed quite a bit of experimentation in Lover. The sounds of False God, Miss Americana and I think he knows felt very different from what she usually does and 'Afterglow', 'Cornelia Street' and 'Lover' are three of her best songs ever. ( For me). But, from the GP's pov, Lover as an album would seem pointless as they would judge it by the singles."
2218,2020-11-08 15:57:08,jqaa9s,"Lover has like my two or three Taylor tracks EVER, but I would still rank it quite low in her discography. I can't pin down why exactly, but it's such a bumpy journey for me"
2219,2020-11-08 16:51:55,jqaa9s,[deleted]
2220,2020-11-08 14:59:02,jqaa9s,"Yeah I’m not here for this Lover slander. It’s a great album with some deep cuts this sub is sleeping on. We meme all day about Cruel Summer but I see no love for Death By A Thousand Cuts and Cornelia Street.

Edit: coming back here after seeing the top comment in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/jq6mkb/what_are_your_favorite_not_their_best_but_a_good/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) a few posts down 🤦"
2221,2020-11-08 20:47:30,jqaa9s,"yeah Lover was not done for a good reason really but i still enjoyed a lot of it

commercially though 4 was by far Bey's least successful work and i feared she was nearing obscurity, thank god for self-titled"
2222,2020-11-09 02:18:13,jqaa9s,"I think amongst the average person (maybe even the average /r/popheads user) Lover would rank higher then Reputation. Sure, it wasn't as 'inspired', but the music was just better IMO. It did definitely get slightly worse on relistens for me though, it's just that Reputation didn't get any better."
2223,2020-11-09 14:48:04,jqaa9s,"I mean, when you really think about it, it doesn't have to be true-- both Bjork and Fiona Apple never really had that album. And that's entirely because each of their albums are completely different."
2224,2020-11-08 15:48:40,jqaa9s,"Nice to see someone mention BTR. I thought Elevate was their best album, but 24/Seven has my favorite songs by them like Just Getting Started, Love Me Again, Song For You. I always found it so crazy that w/Elevate they did a song like No Idea and then put out basic pop bops on 24/Seven?? Anyways you're right because I think they fought for Elevate to sound like that, and they were probably tired w/Nick and done w/their contract

I could never sit down to fully listen to their debut bc I hate the cover that much but is it really that great?"
2225,2020-11-08 19:33:33,jqaa9s,"24/seven was where they had much more input into the material. Yes, it was more generic and without a “theme” of sorts (BTR was more ‘nostalgic’ and popular while Elevate was very very synthy). But I dunno, it feels just correct to round out their 3 albums. I think it just feels correct, more grown up??? I guess? I can’t really say it in words"
2226,2020-11-09 04:58:40,jqaa9s,"Yeah, it took me a while to warm up to 24/Seven. The weird thing is that the album starts off so well with the first three tracks, and then it's just inconsistent from there. Some of the bonus tracks (Untouchable, Just Getting Started, Love Me Again) should have been on the standard release.

From my understanding, several songs from the album sessions leaked and I'm 100% sure they had to replace some of them (""Cruise Control"" was one of the leaked songs and it sounds better than some of the songs they went with). Also, Nickelodeon replaced the original version of ""Love Me Again"" with something more kid-friendly. I don't know why because on Elevate, they allowed ""Show Me"" and Kendall saying ""hell"" on ""Music Sounds Better with U,"" but I think the band had to fight for some of that stuff."
2227,2020-11-09 17:14:30,jqaa9s,"Agree wholeheartedly. It has both some of her best singles (""Loveeeeeee Song,"" ""Pour It Up,"" ""Stay"") and some of her best deep cuts (""Love Without Tragedy / Mother Mary,"" ""Lost in Paradise""). I think it's her second best album, only after *Rated R.*"
2228,2020-11-08 21:09:21,jqaa9s,Normani's taking that adage to heart huh
2229,2020-11-08 20:42:30,jqaa9s,i feel like most pop singers already wait 2-3 years though
2230,2020-11-08 20:58:21,jqaa9s,Am I the only one who thinks she decided to release it now not to have to do an exhausting tour along with it?
2231,2020-11-09 01:03:15,jqaa9s,"I agree, I've heard grown adults in their 50-60s showing appreciation for Ariana Grande. She's not a targeted artist."
2232,2020-11-09 02:14:42,jqaa9s,"This thread isn't about Positions, that was just OP's example."
2233,2020-11-08 13:05:20,jqaa9s,I’m so happy that this bot exist because I sometimes have to pause for 20 seconds to guess the acronym. IKYWT.
2234,2020-11-08 18:27:46,jqaa9s,"Honestly, I think it’s among her most honest, vulnerable music. She portrays herself as a complete emotional mess in that album, and that felt a lot more genuine than than some of her past work."
2235,2020-11-08 21:12:09,jqaa9s,"Yeah there are some HARD misses on Lover but also some of my favorite songs (Afterglow, The Archer, DBATC). Overall I think folklore is a superior album and I likely will come back to it more often, but I *liked* Lover overall and thought it was a good step forward (plus commercially successful, so get that cash girl)"

2239,2020-11-08 16:18:12,jqaa9s,"A lot of Lover is great but a lot of Lover is not so great. I’d bet money that if she could re-do any album cycle, the Lover album cycle is where she’d make the most changes."
2240,2020-11-08 15:16:49,jqaa9s,I became a Swiftie with Lover. I honestly don't get the hate.

2242,2020-11-09 20:50:35,jqaa9s,"I actually noticed that reputation turned a lot of people who hated taylor or simply didnt care for her into fans. It is a fan favourite and it is definitely more liked than Lover. Lover was more critically acclaimed but I think part of the criticism that rep got was due to taylor's public persona rather than the music itself. Besides, it aged like fine line, unlike Lover (sorry :/)

2249,2020-11-08 15:18:56,jqaa9s,"Agreed, I’m a massive Swifty. She is open to criticism. She is not everyone’s cup of tea and that is okay! Lover is my least favorite album from her. It has some amazing tracks, but it also has some of my least favorite tracks from her. I personally don’t go back to the entire album very much like I do her other albums. I just listen to the tracks I like. It reminds me a bit of Red. Red has some of her best songs she has ever written, but it also has Stay Stay Stay."
2250,2020-11-08 16:37:54,jqaa9s,It’s not hate so much as it’s criticism.
2251,2020-11-08 21:10:47,jqaa9s,"i meant **after** the release of 4 with its less successful singles and album sales i **feared she was nearing** obscuring. by her standards, i mean. she still had 3 top 40 hits from it but considering up til then all her albums had had at least one number 1 hit and several more top 10s, the success was not as high.

but yes i agree with you that she could afford the flop after 13 years of smashes."
2252,2020-11-09 14:56:00,jqaa9s,"4 wasn't even a flop,it just underperformed and generated moderately successful singles which paled in comparison to the blockbuster hit singles she generated in her previous eras and let's be real those songs stood the test of time from run the world to love on top etc"
2253,2020-11-09 21:11:34,jqaa9s,"Reputation is an album that I think is liked amongst Swifties, but not amongst more casual listeners. I think if you surveyed /r/popheads users who were not also /r/TaylorSwift users you would not get a favourable result."
2254,2020-11-09 01:22:58,jqaa9s,"Positions is a quarantine album, though. That basically confirms that Ariana made the album out of authentic inspiration. Folklore is the same."

2363,2020-12-30 10:55:23,kmytmf,"It's possible since music is more fragmented than it was 10 years ago, which is a trend that's likely to continue for the reason that it serves the consumer by allowing them to pursue their own tastes more.

I don't think the music megastar will vanish completely, though. What it really comes down to is what we even mean by the idea of fame. In my opinion, what separates the music megastar from the ""ordinary"" famous musician is that their fame *transcends* music. For example, the artists you mentioned in your first paragraph have enormous fame even with people who have *never heard their music* - and you might be surprised by how many people this is. That fame comes because they have broken into the mainstream media and news cycle. Yes, their music was/is extremely popular, but their megastar status wasn't ordained by music listeners. Instead it was ordained by the media (then controlled by mainstream outlets, now more so driven by social media) that accepted them into a world of general celebrity which is ""more global"" than music culture.

In conclusion, the reason why I don't think megastars will disappear is that media (whether traditional or social media) will always be looking to crown a new celebrity whether or not the music itself has been heard by as many people - and ultimately it is media that decides who the celebrity will be, not music listeners.

EDIT: what has also changed, arguably, is that - like music culture - mainstream media culture is also more fragmented and driven by diverse social media rather than uniform entertainment journalism outlets. If there are fewer new music megastars now than there was in the past, it may be because social media can't agree who they should be."
2364,2020-12-30 09:51:31,kmytmf,"Yes but also no. While people's music taste is definitely more eclectic on average these days which is going to lead to more niche artists rising to a moderate level of fame, I see no reason to believe that with the truly massive artists of today like Drake, Billie, Travis Scott, The Weeknd, BTS, Ariana being as huge as they are that there's any sign of the superstar slowing down."
2365,2020-12-31 02:55:29,kmytmf,"I think it depends on what we are considering stardom. No one is really standing out to me as say a Madonna, Janet, Mariah, or a Michael. Rihanna was on track but took a detour into the fashion industry. Beyonce is Beyonce. But when I think of even a Katy Perry or Ed Sheeran...Hell, even a Grande or BTS, something is missing. Where is that staying power. They may last a few years, then fade. Where is that extra oomf at? Even Justin Beiber has practically faded. Some have definitely emerged (Taylor Swift) but music is always an ebb and flow. Especially in my millennial generation."
2366,2020-12-30 13:39:00,kmytmf,"With the continued evolution of how we consume music, along with the prosperity of social media, it’s now even easier for young (career-wise) artists to expand their fan base, thus increasing music discovery without a radio personality telling us what to listen to."

>Whereas now I feel music is far more fragmented.

Admittedly I'm older than some here at 44, but I really don't get this sense at all. If this sub is in any way representative of how younger people view music then you're just wrong. I see far more young people here (teens to early 20's) focussing on what the biggest artist of the day is than I ever saw as a young person. Nobody really gave a shit about top 40/Mainstream music back when I was a teen and noting ""the biggest current thing"" seems far more prevalent now than I remember it ever being as a kid."

And it's not just in Wisconsin it's everywhere. Metal artists for years have questioned who the next festival headliners are gonna be."
2369,2021-01-01 20:32:50,kmytmf,"We live in the era of specialised niches, short attention spamn, wealth of content, algorithm based targeted advertising and increasingly segragated societies. Superstars like Freddie Mercury, Jackson or The Beatles will likely never happen in our lifetimes. Passing fads like Sheeran and Del Rey sure, since marketing needs recognisable faces to brand products. Regional heroes or underground/cult icons, sure it happens. 

It is a wider societal issue.

As for the ones you mention (Eminem, Rihana etc.), no one having lived them in their heyday really cares about them. Mercury sold out movie theaters worldwide while being 6 ft under for 30 years based on name recognition alone. The Beatles and Zeppelin are still selling out re-issues of their past work and are deified in pop-culture for ever. There is no comparisson."

I think the argument comes from people who are not really as in touch with new music as they'd like to think they are. The argument makes sense too: without MTV or radio's dominance you would expect the mainstream artists to not have the popularity they oncehad, but for whatever reason this proved false. 

I listed only three artists at the start but while writing this post I kept coming up with more and more artists I could include, which I feel just proves my point."
2371,2021-01-03 10:59:07,kmytmf,"Kind of, but just as a natural consequence of streaming services being a thing. Anyone can listen to just about anything at any given time, and it's a lot easier for someone to make music and just release it with no further steps than making, uploading, and maybe advertising themselves. Before it was a lot more centered around the radio and what big companies were promoting the hardest. That middleman can now be totally fixed, so you can better curate what you listen to to your own tastes, being able to look for new music whenever at no financial risk, since it costs nothing extra to go to an artist's page you've never heard before and listen to their stuff, whereas you used to actually have to sink money into buying a record."
2372,2020-12-30 17:17:37,kmytmf,"Thought provoking question. As I look back, I think these things go in cycles.

You say it as if it was a bad thing. 

Rather than having a few artists who dominate the scene whose music is written and produced by the same people it is better for music consumers to have a wider palette of moderately popular artists to chose from. Perhaps people got bored with the samey music in the 2000's mainstream and tried to find artists closer to their tastes.

And as for music awards, why do they even matter? Does a pile of metal make a piece of music better?"
2374,2020-12-31 06:30:18,kmytmf,"A good thing for the listeners because they'll be able to find a niche for their taste in music more easily and they'd be able to ignore the things they don't like more easily as well.

A bad thing for the artist because they will have less presence on people's minds and they may not be able to earn profits with their work, at least not as well."

Exactly.

That makes so much sense. Yeah I guess you're right. I just have felt over the past few years there isn't the same crop of people like there were in early 2000's (eminem, rihanna etc). So maybe the media has been 'failing' to crown anybody a celebrity? Maybe haha I don't know

>what has also changed, arguably, is that - like music culture - mainstream media culture is also more fragmented and driven by diverse social media rather than uniform entertainment journalism outlets.

>truly massive artists of today like Drake, Billie, Travis Scott, The Weeknd, BTS, Ariana being as huge as they are that there's any sign of the superstar slowing down.

I agree, they probably wont slow down but I guess I am arguing that there wont be any 'new' ones in the future because all these examples are at least a couple of years old and there seems to be fewer and fewer truly 'global' superstars coming out every year. 

Don't know, just my opinion"
2378,2020-12-30 14:56:43,kmytmf,"Agreed, which is why I feel that more and more people can get moderate levels of fame and success rather than fewer with superstar levels of fame and success.

It has evened out the playing field and more people can be successful but since there is so much more competition (and less money in record labels) there are fewer 'superstars'. Most of the ones you think of became superstars years ago rather than any recent ones. 

Strictly my opinion"
2379,2020-12-30 18:23:14,kmytmf,"Coming in about 5 years older than you, and generally agree with your sentiments with a couple of exceptions that I think stem from the age difference. Generally speaking, my peers and I who became adults in the late 1980s were more into the Top 40 of that day. We'd also see that contrary camp that said Top 40 sucked and would go out of their way to be Alternative (Smiths, Depeche Mode, Siouxsie and the Banshees, etc).  I was that kid who sorta listened to everything, including Zeppelin, Rush, Elvis Costello, and even my ""Dad's music"" like the Doors, Beatles, etc.

Now the reason I say that 5 years between us makes a difference is that the whole grunge  and alternative thing just passed right by me and the folks in my social circle of the early 90s."
2380,2020-12-30 20:53:23,kmytmf,"I’m the same age as you and I think the reason we didn’t care so much about the top 40 when we were teens is because a lot of that music wasn’t made for teens. Did *you* know anyone in high school who listened to Michael Bolton or Celine Dion? Because I sure as hell did not, that was for old people. Even early Mariah Carey came across a bit stuffy, and she was an actual young person! Meanwhile Nirvana only had two top 40 US hits, but they were extremely relevant to our age group. Nowadays the music that hits the top 40 is mostly relevant to teenagers, so they’re more likely to care than we did."

Do you mean people too young to have lived when they were big? As in people born after 2000's for example?"
2383,2020-12-31 06:17:21,kmytmf,"Fair enough, they are big artists!

>but for whatever reason this proved false.

What makes you say its proved false? How can you tell the mainstream artists have the same popularity as in the past?"
2384,2021-01-03 11:02:20,kmytmf,">Kind of, but just as a natural consequence of streaming services being a thing. Anyone can listen to just about anything at any given time, and it's a lot easier for someone to make music and just release it with no further steps than making, uploading, and maybe advertising themselves.

Exactly.

>That middleman can now be totally fixed

What do you mean by that?

But yeah, I think streaming services have paved the way for so many more artists to have exposure and as such the market is more saturated so it's harder to stand out and reach that 'superstar' status. Which is a good and bad thing I guess"
2385,2020-12-30 17:31:48,kmytmf,"Hahah thanks! Thats a very nice thing to say.

Thats an interesting insight! I never realised elite superstars/fragmentation was also a cyclic thing! So would you say you've observed this cycle before, where there was a period of fragmented musicians before the big names (such as Eminem/Rihanna/Taylor etc)?"
2386,2020-12-31 06:15:58,kmytmf,">You say it as if it was a bad thing.

You're right, I edited it, thanks for pointing that out.

> Perhaps people got bored with the samey music in the 2000's mainstream and tried to find artists closer to their tastes.

Yeah I completely agree, that makes sense as a reason why music is more fragmented 

>And as for music awards, why do they even matter? Does a pile of metal make a piece of music better?

Nah, that wasnt my point. I am not saying they matter, I just meant in the past it was easy to tell who the superstars were because you could see who they were at award shows whereas now there are so many that award shows don't have the select few 'superstars'"
2387,2020-12-31 07:29:04,kmytmf,I think not having a dominating force in the scene would actually allow for more musicians/producers and related workers to make a living of it.
2388,2020-12-31 15:58:36,kmytmf,Agreed
2389,2020-12-30 13:15:39,kmytmf,">I am arguing that there wont be any 'new' ones in the future because all these examples are at least a couple of years old

I think if you went back to when these people were first getting famous (i.e. in the last 2-5 years, for most of them), you'd have argued that they weren't superstars. It takes a few years to build up to that level. There probably will be new superstars five years from now, and some of them are probably names you already know but just don't consider to be superstars yet."
2390,2020-12-31 06:21:18,kmytmf,">whole grunge and alternative thing just passed right by me and the folks in my social circle of the early 90s.

What do you mean passed by me?"
2391,2020-12-31 14:10:48,kmytmf,"Yes I think this is 'correct.'  In the 80s, Top 40 did *seem* to be more in tune (pun?) with teens."
2392,2021-01-02 06:58:29,kmytmf,"I can't find an exact article but something like this

2393,2021-01-02 11:31:37,kmytmf,"I count respect by peers and street cred alike, cultural impact and longentivity.

None of the latest acts (20 years or so) even come close to the older ones. Very few exceptions."
2394,2020-12-31 17:32:36,kmytmf,Because they're massive and dominate the pop music scene? I'm not really sure what else to say here.
2395,2021-01-03 11:26:21,kmytmf,"there are a couple of words missing, it was meant to be ""the issue of that middleman"", that middleman being radio broadcasters and record labels, and the issue being their push of only the most ""marketable"" music and the difficulty of exploring new music as a result."
2396,2020-12-30 15:01:12,kmytmf,Yeah possibly. I will check back in five years time and you have permission to tell me 'I told you so!' :P
2397,2020-12-31 14:09:03,kmytmf,I should have said 'pass me by.' Short answer: I didn't get into grunge.

2474,2020-12-30 03:04:27,kmtk35,Jesus she looks perfect in that pic
2475,2020-12-30 03:17:34,kmtk35,Look at those big feet 🥵😍
2476,2020-12-30 21:05:10,kmtk35,She's a goddess
2477,2020-12-30 02:59:53,kmtena,I think Brenda likes dudes
2478,2020-12-30 04:51:40,kmtena,"Lol I think he was actually thinking of Tyler The Creator, just having one of his Brendumb moments and no one ever wants to fact check him bc they’re afraid of losing their jobs"
2479,2020-12-30 02:56:02,kmtena,"How someone can talk so matter-of-factly, with utter confidence about a so called 'well known fact', and be so completely wrong, is truly admirable. 😂

2480,2020-12-30 07:19:52,kmtena,ASAP skipping leg days
2481,2020-12-30 06:17:02,kmtena,Please let Brenda get caught slipping at a big boxing PPV.
2482,2020-12-30 06:53:23,kmtena,Hey! He was certainly not straight when Brenton fucked him last month!
2483,2020-12-30 10:59:08,kmtena,"He probably meant Tyler the Creator. I blame the CTE. Although, he does say they all look alike."
2484,2020-12-30 06:36:04,kmtena,I wasn’t aware that anyone thought he was gay??
2485,2020-12-30 07:17:21,kmtena,Grade A projection
2486,2020-12-30 03:21:07,kmtena,🤷🏽‍♂️
2487,2020-12-30 12:35:07,kmtena,Dude also named his son tiger.....
2488,2020-12-30 15:38:03,kmtena,Clear projection of his own homosexuality
2489,2020-12-30 10:55:51,kmtena,WTF did he say that?  ASAP Rocky is like a known playboy who had many famous girlfriends... does this guy ever get it right?
2490,2020-12-30 12:25:59,kmtena,"ASAP Rocky has been accused of being gay for a decade, most recently by space ghost purp"
2491,2020-12-30 13:04:23,kmtena,Apparently large foreheads run in the family
2492,2020-12-30 14:17:28,kmtena,"What the fuck is this post, bubba?"
2493,2020-12-30 18:56:13,kmtena,ASAP has literal bars about people like Brendan he’s a fucking retard and shouldn’t dabble into that side of the culture.
2494,2020-12-31 03:41:21,kmtena,"It checks out. 

That forehead in the second pic definitely belongs to someone related to Rihanna."
2495,2020-12-30 03:54:14,kmtena,"Sometimes I feel like he's with his girl because she's a caricature of what a hot girl is supposed to look like. Like she checks all the boxes but yet isn't *that* attractive. 

Kind of like how Brenda thinks ""this thing is considered stylish and cool so if I wear it I will be stylish and cool!"""
2496,2020-12-30 05:57:54,kmtena,This is it
2497,2020-12-30 04:55:10,kmtena,LMAO.
2498,2020-12-30 16:12:43,kmtena,Ha I thought the same shit while reading this post 😂
2499,2020-12-30 22:19:04,kmtena,100%
2500,2020-12-31 04:44:14,kmtena,"Tyler and Rocky are super close friends, and Tyler doesn’t really fuck with many people in hip hop, which he’s alluded to being due to his homosexuality and most rappers enjoying different “extracurricular activities” than him, so it’s slightly significant. Brendumb probably got the two cross wired cause of their association, or just assumed Rocky was gay BY association."
2501,2020-12-30 07:52:07,kmtena,"BTW bubba his name is Rocky, ASAP is the groups name"
2502,2020-12-30 21:47:44,kmtena,Makes sense .
2503,2020-12-30 16:19:22,kmtena,There was a clip of Brendan saying ASAP Rocky was gay and everyone knows it from TFATK last week. But Asap Rocky was trending on twitter last night after it was revealed he is dating Rihanna
2504,2020-12-31 20:56:29,kmtena,Bingo
2505,2020-12-30 08:08:14,kmtena,Man I don’t give a damn. Motherfucker can barely stand up with them weak ass legs
2506,2020-12-30 21:46:54,kmtena,Lol you suck... hilariously .
2507,2020-12-30 16:34:22,kmtena,"No I geeed it but why even indulge in this lol. You're posting pictures of a man with a woman going ""SEE HE'S NOT GAY"" we know, B. Obviously he's not the smartest tool in the shed"
2508,2020-12-30 09:12:54,kmtena,Bruh hes fucking rihanna I'm not sure HE gives a damn
2509,2020-12-30 16:39:33,kmtena,why post ennything on a discussion forum?
2510,2020-12-30 12:50:16,kmtena,[removed]
2511,2020-12-30 16:42:04,kmtena,"Yes, but Ima be honest, this one just comes off as very desperate"

2521,2020-12-30 17:45:17,kmr04m,i’m pretty sure ratchet with rihanna and beyoncé was just a myth
2522,2020-12-30 05:22:30,kmr04m,"Well she is Italian.... that is considered non-white in some parts of America lol. But yes, that proposed collaboration could have used a different name. I have heard the sample of the beat on soundcloud and it really gives me Bauer meets Diplo. Oh well..."
2523,2021-01-03 15:42:52,kmr04m,"Beyoncé and Rihanna being on the track was never confirmed and was pretty much shot down by Rihanna via IG around the time the “tracklist” for ARTPOP leaked.

I think it was supposed to be just Gaga and Azealia because, why wouldn’t she release a song that also featured Beyoncé and Rihanna? She could easily remove her verse and keep the song as is, or even get another female rapper to feature (but I think Azealia ever being on ARTPOP was due to the fact that they were label mates and Interscope was really trying to break her into the mainstream before her debut album drops)"
2524,2020-12-30 19:28:05,kmr04m,Honestly same but i choose to believe in that myth lmao
2525,2020-12-30 05:51:08,kmr04m,"yeah. Ratchet is the female equivilent to jewels n drugs but jewels n drugs will never be on ratchet's level. now what azealia needs to do is do the same shit she did with the ANTI demos and just release her verses on ratchet and other demos she has. Gaga’s Red Flame vocals were ok, Azealia slayed the fuck outta that shit but I would’ve liked it if Gaga had two verses or wrote a part to go with the bridge. Red Flame honestly would’ve fit right between Donatella and Fashion!. The bars in red flame leave us to wonder about the bars in ratchet cause red flame was probably two of her best verses tbh. the bridge was insane too. the beat is very....under produced? it’s cute but it definitely needs a face lift. it lacks something. I don’t know exactly what but it lacks something important."
2526,2020-12-30 07:32:58,kmr04m,"Idk, I like the demo just fine. I do recognize the underproduced element, but I think it's sorta like an exposed brick wall in an interior design. It adds a bit of grit and rusticism to the track. There's already soo much richness with the crystalline ""bongs"" and the elegant order to ""pump it""."
2527,2020-12-30 05:52:54,kmr04m,also the reason red flame had to 3 azealia verses was because they were all being considered to be on the song but only one and the bridge was supposed to make the cut
2528,2020-12-30 15:16:44,kmr04m,yeah
