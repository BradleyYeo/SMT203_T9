16,2020-02-04 17:39:59,eysgnq,"I listen mostly to metal, followed by rock and electronic subgenres. Music is essentially my fuel.

Metal: goth, prog, folk, symphonic, heavy and industrial

Rock: prog, alternative, hard, post-punk and electro

Electronic: synthwave, cyberpunk/dark electro, witch house, electro swing and drum & bass

I also love listening to video game OSTs, or ambient music when I'm reading. But I'll listen to anything regardless of genre if I like that particular song, most just happen to fall under the umbrella of metal genres."
17,2020-02-04 19:45:43,eysgnq,"Metal: Especially Metalcore and Nu Metal but I listen to a lot of the genres.

Rock: Usually Hard rock and 90s punk rock.

Rap: Very little, mostly Eminem and Tech N9ne.

Everything else: Video games soundtracks, some classical (mostly violin.) and very few exceptions in other genre like Ed Sheeran when I'm in that mood and need something soft.

I'm very quiet and introverted so music is kind of my door into the other side, hard and loud."

22,2020-02-04 19:59:02,eysgnq,"What i find interesting is that there are people who dont love music.  I couldnt live without it (and subsequently; flow states).  My favorite genres are electronic, metal, avante garde & neo classical.

For the last couple of years ive been following an electronic genre of music coming out of France. (and surrounding areas) This music is considered a form of progressive house.  Its like a melodic ethereal prog house though.  This is some of the best ive ever had the pleasure of listening too.  My first rave was in '93 - ''94 so im old.  Ive also attended a lot of clubs on the east coast.  \[My favorite of all time being Studio 6 / Tru in AC\] .  For those that dont know, electronic music style is typically very regional.If you havent listened to this newish type of music check out some of these musicians.**DJ's:**Ben CWlad RoerichClement BertolleFillizzz

**Here's others i like for reference:**

**Neo Classical:**  ( Max Richter, Olafur Arnolds, Nils Frahm and similar)

**Avant Garde:**  Radiohead, sigur ros etc

23,2020-02-04 21:36:54,eysgnq,My music taste ranges from power metal to Disney soundtracks. From classical music to hardstyle. But mostly edm. Recently I acquired a taste for drumm n' bass.
24,2020-02-04 18:58:31,eysgnq,Whatever doesn't suck.
25,2020-02-04 18:04:02,eysgnq,"I get the idea of making connections thru music. I think there should be a music dating app, a Tinder of music. But the ""what kind of music do you like"" opener is kind of a pet peeve question for me. My tastes are wide open but my standards are super picky so the answer is ""I only listen to the very best kinds of music"". Sounds like dick response but it's sort of true. 

Doesn't everyone listen to all genres and have favorites that move them?  I may gravitate away from some scenes but if a track has a fun hook, tastefully original melody, gut-punching lyrics, passionate emotional delivery, I add it. I listen to ALL music looking for that."
26,2020-02-04 18:25:10,eysgnq,"Psychedelic rock, Funk, Binaural, LO-FI, old school rap, Indie."
27,2020-02-04 20:01:48,eysgnq,"I think music is a generational thing and maybe a racial/ethnic thing more so than a personality thing.


I listen to mostly grunge and stoner rock."
28,2020-02-04 20:15:45,eysgnq,"Music is a big part of my life and when I like a band I'll listen to their whole discography for months then change it up and listen to something else. Mostly it's alternative rock, metalcore, and emo-ish stuff. 

My favorites are The Strokes, Death Cab for Cutie, A Day to Remember, Fall Out Boy, Say Anything, Taking Back Sunday, The Black Keys, Cake, TOOL, My Chemical Romance, and Red Hot Chili Peppers."
29,2020-02-04 20:10:43,eysgnq,"I listen primarily to heavy metal, rock and lyrical or underground rap.  Not a huge fan of pop or today's country music, but my tastes span all genres.  

I grew up with classical music, movie OSTs, golden oldies, and country.  By the time I was finally allowed (yes, allowed) to listen to other types of music in middle school, I found myself immediately drawn to whatever sounded like it required a lot of musical talent.  I'll tell ya, the drums in Avenged Sevenfold's Blinded in Chains shook me.  I became friends with mostly fellow metalheads in highschool - enter Dummy Borgir, Amon Amarth, Slipknot, Devildriver (personal fav), Children of Bodom, etc.  

Then rap took hold with Eminem.  I was in a Marshall Mathers III fan club, complete with magazines and posters.  Enter Tech N9ne, Madchild, Ekoh and Chris Weeby, etc.

All the while, I can still be found sipping whiskey listening to Andrea Bocelli, E.S. Posthumous, or the soundtrack to Dragon Age Inquisition, or Skyrim, or Assassin's Creed. 

Sometimes along a sunny highway, I love smooth electronic music with jazzy notes like the stuff of Big Gigantic or Gramatik.  Maybe a little bluegrass and folk like Miner, Nathaniel Ratliff and the Night Sweats, Shakey Graves, Nahko and Medicine for the People, Caamp and Brandi Carlile etc. 

My music tastes really depend on my mood, and change quite erratically.  Which I think says something lol 
One minute I'm screaming the lyrics to The Fury of Our Maker's Hand by Devildriver, and the next I might throw on some CCR.  Who knows?  Lol"
30,2020-02-04 22:14:41,eysgnq,"I'm a singer and dabble in guitar & piano. I love performing but it can be tough to keep up with all the meeting strangers on a regular basis. I've been in bands ranging from punk-pop to heavy metal and a few indie/R&B side-projects. I listen to a wide range of music, basically anything but country and rap, though there are a few exceptions to both of those genres. Lately I've been getting into instrumental prog like Plini and Polyphia, then also just about anything with a good vocalist; Emarosa, I The Mighty, The Color Morale, Periphery."
31,2020-02-04 22:50:42,eysgnq,"Mostly stuff from the 90‚Äôs although over the years I have listened from classical to some modern stuff when it was around 2010. Haven‚Äôt been able to get into any new bands from after then. So an eclectic mix of grunge bands like Alice In Chains, Soundgarden and shortly after that Tool.  But among my favorites are also artists like Tom Waits, David Bowie, Misfits, Kyuss, The Beatles, Faith No More to Video Game OST‚Äôs (Jeremy Soule‚Äôs work I love, alongside the OST‚Äôs from Dark Souls/Bloodborne/WoWarcraft). Although I‚Äôve listened to everything from Wagner, Bach and Vivaldi, through to Green Day, Death, Darkthrone while jamming to some N.W.A. I mostly like everything as long as it has some goddamn passion. Or makes me laugh. 

Maybe important to mention I was a professional musician, I‚Äôve played around 1000 gigs in all kinds of different venues from one person to thousands of people. So the effect it has had is quite substantial. So I‚Äôm still somewhat in shock when I‚Äôm somewhere and one of those ‚ÄúDo they still know 90‚Äôs music‚Äù videos pops up and some kids don‚Äôt even seem to know November Rain."

36,2020-02-04 17:08:03,eysgnq,"I do this exact same thing when I‚Äôm making new friends or if I‚Äôm interested in a guy just to kinda see what he vibes with. Like I was getting to know this guy who liked the really hardcore rap where the lyrics are just a turnoff and the guy was a turnoff cause he was kinda narcissistic like very self centered. As far as music I like I enjoy dance music from house & techno to drum‚Äôn‚Äôbass to old school dubstep and all in between and I like chill out music from trip hop to lofi hip hop. Sometimes depending on my mood I‚Äôll listen to alternative rock, new age funk, r&b and tons of other stuff that has a chill vibe to it. If I‚Äôm listening to anything rap it‚Äôs for the beat/instrumentals. I have like 13 different genre playlists on my Spotify and my SoundCloud is mostly used for edm that‚Äôs not on Spotify or YouTube. I love music and exploring to find new music :) I love the feeling of finding a new song and getting goosebumps from it."
37,2020-02-04 20:06:43,eysgnq,"Me personally. I'm not much of a person for music. The only artist I properly listen to is eminem.

My main music listening style is more game soundtracks and movies and tv shows. Game of thrones has some pretty great music as does star wars. Sicario has 3 songs which I love like alejandro's song, the beast and soccer game. Though I listen to a lot more independant aritsts than signed ones but even still not religiously"
38,2020-02-04 20:21:55,eysgnq,"Growing up as a kid I loved rock n roll because that‚Äôs what my dad listened to and I was always around it. As I went through highschool I got a little into rap and hip hop but I found it getting repetitive and todays rap feels so brainless to me now. (my opinion, based on what I‚Äôve heard) 

More recently though, I‚Äôve been introduced to EDM/dubstep music from my college friends. All my life prior to being introduced I thought it was just weird. I thought dubstep was just uncomfortable and I wouldn‚Äôt want to be seen listening to it. After acclimating to it (it took time to get used to, for me at least) I find myself only listening to Dubstep/EDM And I‚Äôm unable to go back to rap/hip hop, but I can go back to Rock if I want.
Some artists I like are: Excision, Zomboy, Space laces, Getter, Dion Timmer, Megalodon, Spag Heddy, Ivory, Wooli, Virtual Riot... and many more. 
I‚Äôve put a lot of thought into why I like certain music and not others and I think it really comes down to a few things:
1. The song needs strong sub-bass frequencies. Without it there‚Äôs no concrete foundation for the song and it sounds like garbage
2. The song needs to spark my imagination to some degree. This is hard to explain, but for many of my favorite songs, my mind makes little visuals, almost like a little movie for each song. 
3. The song cannot have those annoying screechy ass sounds that some edm songs have, I can‚Äôt stand them."
39,2020-02-04 20:25:20,eysgnq,"For me it's symphonic metal like xandria, epica, kamelot, or nightwish. Using metaphors to paint a much bigger picture is usually a win for me

Unsure what genre hurt is but I like the raw emotion in their songs as well

Finally I despise rap, country, and most american pop due to lyrics"
40,2020-02-04 21:33:48,eysgnq,"Most of my musical taste centers around industrial, but cover a lot of territory and try to have a pedestrian understanding of different genres. While I don't like everything, I give most things a whirl if they sound like something I should know about.

As far as life impact, I did my graduate work in popular music. My partner is an avant garde classical performer, and we learn a lot from one another because we approach it from two different angles. She's from the western art field and I'm from a social sciences/ethnomusicology field.

I'm not a musician, personally, but I've helped with academic work in dance music. I book folk and singer songwriter bands for my local community festival. It's basically my social capital that I can exchange with others. I don't have a lot else."
41,2020-02-04 23:17:06,eysgnq,"Metal and rock subgenres: folk rock, symphonic metal, epic metal (Queen, Skillet, Theory of a Deadman, Sabaton, Neffex...)

Sometimes I listen to classic music and electronic subgenres: melodic dubstep (even if I don't tend to like dubstep, I found that when it's melodic it forms a curious and interesting combination), glitch hop, electro swing, French house.
I like the combination of the new and the old.

On occasions I listen to remixes of game/movies music."
42,2020-02-04 23:43:54,eysgnq,"when people ask me this question I feel uncomfortable. Music is something I only like to listen to alone, it‚Äôs something I enjoy personally discovering."
43,2020-02-05 03:56:23,eysgnq,"Trap/rap, electronic, and old Mexican corridos/cumbias. My favorite in each is Playboi Carti, Knife Party, and Ramon Ayala."
44,2020-02-04 18:20:23,eysgnq,"Music is very important to me but I always find it hard to answer that question because I listen to almost every type of music. I don't limit my music taste to any specific genres or bands, I listen to what I want to listen at that moment. I don't have favorite bands or songs, though there are some bands and artists that I like a lot but they change often because I love discovering new music and my taste in music changes all the time."

My music tastes are vast. My preferences come in seasons. But once I love a sound I never forget it. I like Daft Punk, Odesza, JME, Stormzy, Jess Glynne, Prince, Earth/Wind/Fire, Queen, Ray Charles, Electric Light Orchestra, Pachelbel, Galantis, Calvin Harris, Elton John, Johnny Cash, Lauryn Hill, The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Mamas&Papas, LSD (Labrinth, Sia, and Diplo), Sir the Baptist, BJ the Chicago Kidd, , Bruno Mars, Outkast, Crookers, Baltimore Club, Justin Timberlake, Jon Bellion, Awolnation, RATM, MEUTE,  Backstreet Boys, Leon Bridges, C2C, Swedish House Mafia, Scooter, Eisbrecher, Alt-J, Florence and the Machine, Chet Faker, FKJ, The Lumineers, Justice, Parov Stelar, Petit Biscuit, and Coldplay...

47,2020-02-04 18:55:29,eysgnq,"I can enjoy everything from opera to trash metal. But mostly Deep Purple, Korn, Ramstein, Prodigy and Skrillex."
48,2020-02-04 20:12:07,eysgnq,"I mostly enjoy classical rock, and metal. I don't know what that tells you."
49,2020-02-04 20:12:46,eysgnq,"Firstly, the types of music we listen to is only indicative of a small part of ourselves. Everything we do to express ourselves is only an outlet, welcome to basic behavioral profiling you may already know it, but in case you dont, everything about you provides sustenance towards profiling.

If your talking to someone, their taste in music is only one part of a much larger whole. 

Ask them about the lottery, their dreams, idols, etc. The further out there you make the subject the more honesty you'll likely encounter. Most people might have cookie cutter answers for popular questions, but not really for ""what if"" or ""what would you do"" types. So their answers even if untrue, is genuine thoughts. 

As for my music tastes, I despise rap, country, and most metal type of music.

I greatly enjoy folk, chant, classical and symphonic music's, and stuff like that."

51,2020-02-04 20:37:27,eysgnq,"That's a prime question for me. I was always a music lover, particularly always get obsessed about bands for some reason. Befriended a lot of people through shared music taste and met some bands too. 

I'm not picky but it just happens that most of the music I like is punk. Lots of rock music, occasionally steampunk or dark cabarett, a bit of metal, bit of rap or DnB. A nice side effect of punk is that a considerable aspect of it is certain views that unite the people that create and listen to it, so it also gives you a lot of things in common.

Seeing Muse as one of the top votes is funny because I used to be a hardcore Muse fan. I do prefer the first 3 albums, not that big of a fan of the poppier n electronic direction they took later on.

55,2020-02-04 20:52:41,eysgnq,"For me, Literally everything.  Each sound, lyric, and cultural association can evoke a range of emotions (at least for me).

\-Conscious rap (Joey Bada$$, Kendrick, J. Cole, Denzel Curry).  I enjoy this for the lyrical content and the urban vibe.

\-1990s hip hop.  For similar reasons as Conscious rap, but it feels more ""vintage""

\-Mainstream hip hop (Lil Tjay, Dababy, Future, Young Thug, Uzi).  Although it can get repetitive and it's not deep, I love the production.  High energy, melodic, great for getting hype before a workout or pregaming

\-Rock (Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Steely Dan, The Eagles, Phil Davis, Red Hot Chili Peppers).  I love the non-linear song structure, and the electric guitar is an ear orgasm.  Sounds next level beautiful when cooked.

\-House/EDM.  Paradoxically, I love the linear song structure here.  I think the hard, pounding beats can just be so satisfying and intense sometimes.  Sounds fucking amazing when on Adderall.

\-Spanish/Reggaeton (Shakira, Daddy Yankee, Wisin, Enrique Iglesias, Santana).  Puts me in a summer-is mood.  I know lots of Hispanic people and I've spent 4 weeks in Spain as well as some time in Mexico, so I like how the music reminds me of those awesome vacations

\-Nirvana.  Grunge is lit.

\-Reggae (Bob Marley, Dennis Brown, Barrington Levy, Shabba) just cuz it contrasts with the normally high intensity music I'm always pounding

\-""Country-ish"" (The Wallflowers, Jon Pardi, Stone Temple Pilots, Lynyrd Skynyrd).  I have family in the midwest, and the vibe of the music just reminds me of big open fields and cows and long highway road trips"

Then, my fathers put me into this school where kids listened to pop, rap and rock, (Nu metal was in its prime) so I picked up a lot of SOAD, Linkin Park, Michael Jackson, Britney Spears, Nirvana, Eminem, 50 cents, etc..
When I was 12, my family moved to another country. There I picked even more metal, but also picked EDM, and popular teenagers pop (Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, T-pain, David Guetta, etc). In college I got into Tupac, Metallica and other classics.

I just mentioned the popular artists or bands that I had in the top of my mind. I kinda listen to almost everything. What does that tells you about me?"
57,2020-02-04 21:18:18,eysgnq,"I listen to outrun and most of its subgenres. For a few years I listened to lo-fi like most of the Internet when YouTube basically promoted it. Before that in my early 20s I was really into jazz, drum n bass, finishing up my metal and rock obsession, and what I can only describe as weab music with them hot anime intros. Guns N Roses is my favorite band and have gone to see them twice in their recent ‚ÄúNot in this lifetime‚Äù tour but I‚Äôve never been into concerts. Back in high school I listened to metal, mostly deathcore though like Whitechapel and Suicide Silence, but I listened to a lot of lighter stuff like Arch Enemy, August Burns Red, Cradle of Filth, etc. I‚Äôve also dabbled in some of the mainstream stuff as well, they‚Äôre the top 40 or whatever for a reason, Macklemore, Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z, you know the filthy casual music where you can‚Äôt claim to be an elitist INTJ in your music choice because everyone absolutely loved Justin‚Äôs Suit & Tie when it dropped or Jay‚Äôs Empire State of Mind. As time has gone by, I‚Äôve become more and more aware of how music with lyrics is more distracting than helpful, and nowadays avoid lyrical music as much as possible. Music used to express my feelings/emotions, now it‚Äôs about a state of mind. Those two things may sound the same but listening to Unanswered By Suicide Silence for the millionth time to express my anger or Breakdown by GNR to express my nihilism is very different than listening to some outrun to keep myself in the zone of whatever task is at hand, or listening to jazz to help in relaxing, or listening to some Mozart to get that real INTJ psychopathy out in the wild for a bit lol."

59,2020-02-04 21:26:45,eysgnq,"I listen to a lot of metal, J-pop, rock, etc... but I'm also into classical. I play the French horn (section leader for my high school band), which is frequently labeled as the hardest brass instrument, but I enjoy playing it still. In band class, we do play a lot of classical music, so it makes sense as to why I like classical. One of my most favorite classical pieces would probably have to be Gustav Holst's Mars, The Bringer of War. 

Music has a pretty big impact on my own life, considering I play an instrument, but also because it really helps me relieve stress that builds up overtime. I also listen to music through my earbuds in a vehicle just to pass the time. While listening to music, I also tend to go into my mind and just hang out with myself. When I'm listening to music, my fears and worries pretty much disappear. That's what music is to me.

(Quick edit: I saw someone say jazz, I also like jazz, but I don't listen to it as frequently. I will say that of all of the jazz I've heard up to now, Mack the Knife is my favorite)"

I only seek those out when I am emotionaly inclined though. Pop-rock, again SS based, or New wave are more likely to join my current everyday playlist.

My top favourite bands, which are currently only for the various types of rock I listen to, are The Beatles, The Moody Blues, The Chills, The Cleaners From Venus, Klaatu, and Medusa (1975). 

I seem to prefer obscure music, with The Beatles, and The Moody Blues if I'm lucky/I'm speaking to someone my mom's age, being the only bands out of the main ones I actively listen to that anyone recognises in real life. 

I think the best way to sum up the music I like is 'relatively fast, with weight'. I also seem to prefer music that is in the 7-9 minute range.

Their's sucked as the sound soul-death, much less brain-death, and I was a teenager by the time I heard ""devil music"", which was a bit late for apparently anything ever.

The very concept of a concert is perverse. I've no use for being corralled into a mob for any reason. I've no use for live music either. I can't control it, and it's shittier sounding, even if the crowd would shut the fuck up. It's ironically worse than most days of being stuck in a damn cultish dumb-off, partly because it often is the same damn thing, just sociopolitical instead of explicitly religious.

When I don't forget to listen to anything, which is often, I used to listen to rock, but my age and health has harshed my hormones, and even relatably angsty stuff is just numbly depressing at this point in the downward spiral. Anything victorious just sounds dumb because it is.

I go through phases drifting from one subgenre to another and back again as I need to unfamiliarize a set of songs before I can appreciate them again.

Polyphia - GOAT, 40oz, O.D. I love how they combine musical quality and complexity with mainstream music.
Opeth - To rid the disease, To bid you farewell, In my time of need, Ending credits, The night and the silent water, Burden, Den standiga resan, Harlequin forest, Hours of wealth, A fair judgement, Bleak, Harvest, The drapery falls, Dirge for november, The moor, Benighted, Face of Melinda... oh forget it, all of their songs are bottled intense experiences, honestly. I don't think you would enjoy some of their songs at first, but as a musician and a music lover they are my favorite band and they are the best band at creating atmospheres. I be like ""there are lots of songs to commit suicide to, I can't decide"". Warning though: You may have a severe depression afterwards, you can think of dying and if you are already suffering from depression, this band can seriously do harm to you. Yeah I maybe became a masochist, but hey I'm loving it. Jokes aside, you should also have some motivating badass stuff to balance it, otherwise you might get into states that you better off be avoiding. 
Camel is also awesome

Very rarely I'll dig out something different: The White Stripes, Molly Hatchet, Coldplay, and stuff from Triple J's Hottest 100.

I also love a lot of music from the 70s.  Black Sabbath, Rush, Motorhead, Heart, Kool and the Gang, Van Halen, Isaac Hayes, AC/DC, ZZ Top, the Gap Band, Stevie Wonder...  I dip a little into punk, mostly just Descendents and Dead Kennedys.  I like some older country, like the amazing Roy Clark, but also some George Jones, Dolly Parton, Johnny Cash, a little Randy Travis.  I don't like rockabilly, but I do like one artist that dips into it a bit, Christian Kane.  I occasionally get in the mood for some of the more symphonic/melodic rap, like some of Ice Cube's stuff.  I love Beethoven, particularly the 5th, the 9th, fur elise, and the Egmont overture.  I listen to some 90s alternative stuff, like Toad the Wet Sprocket, Gin Blossoms, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam's first album, Alice in Chains, Ned's Atomic Dustbin..  I also like some stuff that's kinda hard to categorize, like Pink Floyd, Gorillaz, Tool, Kansas..  sometimes I get into a mood where I just want to hear vietnam-era stuff like the Animals, the Doors, Jefferson Airplane, etc.  Singer-poets like Leonard Cohen, Tori Amos, & Billy Joel.  A lot of 90s girl power kinda bands, like Veruca Salt, the Breeders, and the Juliana Hatfield Three.  I love Liz Phair, especially Exile in Guyville and the earlier stuff.

The bands I've listened to more than any other are probably Pink Floyd, Megadeth, Overkill, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, and Van Halen (adored them from ages 7-20 or so).

Bands I've seen live include Kobra and the Lotus (twice), Megadeth, Motorhead, and Liz Phair.  Planning to finally see Unleash the Archers in March.  First concert was George Jones, but true to form he didn't show.

122,2020-02-04 19:19:50,eysgnq,Big fan of anything with great lyrics. Singer songwriters like Elliott Smith and Kevin Devine blow me away. Rappers like Bambu. Okay even Kanye's pretty damn up there as a great lyricist. Been getting into slow dark jazz and instrumental music lately. I'm also a musician and just dropped a single for my first full length album here: [https://nascarnoir.bandcamp.com/](https://nascarnoir.bandcamp.com/)
123,2020-02-04 19:23:56,eysgnq,"Mostly rock and metal , I dont have favourite bands as long as the music is heavy I listen to it. I don't care what language it is or what band, I have multiple songs from bands I don't listen to ."
124,2020-02-04 19:42:01,eysgnq,"My top three genres are Rock, Metal, Jazz. But my taste is vast enough that I enjoy listening to almost any genre, and have a favourite for artist/band to listen to in that genre. Except K-POP, I never really understood why most people in my country love it. 

The reason I have a vast music taste is probably because of the videogames I play and the music that are played in-game exposed me to a different kind of genre that I normally don't listen to; like Fallout, (Jazz/Country), Assassin's Creed (Neo-Classical) and PAYDAY (EDM)"
125,2020-02-04 19:42:35,eysgnq,"I mostly listen to metal, rock, punk, alternative, indie, blues, jazz, classical, some electronic, some rap, and everything in between and whatever sounds good otherwise.

Music is my biggest passion in life, and it has led to many situations I wouldn't have reached and it introduced me to many people who I consider close friends now. Music triggers very specific emotions that I can't express or experience otherwise, and overall, my relationship with music is VERY hard to describe with words."
126,2020-02-04 19:43:06,eysgnq,"Music is a huge part of my life. I don‚Äôt enjoy concerts because of the crowds but I listen to music in any life situation and I don‚Äôt know what I would do without it. I stress when I forget my headphones even for like a ten minute journey! 
But ‚Äújudging‚Äù someone based on their taste in music is very difficult I‚Äôd say. Personally, I listen to a lot of different genres based on mood, situation etc. so this is a question I would feel weird about."
127,2020-02-04 19:49:19,eysgnq,"EDM, Chillsetp, Drum and Bass, Liquid DnB, Dubstep, Indie, House, Some Hip-hop specifically Post Malone, Joji, 88rising and some things from the most popular artists. Recently been getting into Alternative Rock as well."
128,2020-02-04 19:49:34,eysgnq,"Classical, folk, and music my dad likes."
129,2020-02-04 19:52:25,eysgnq,"i've gone through various music phases throughout my life. as i was being introduced to music, i listened to various forms of rock music. it then began to shift into modern pop music, then into hip-hop as i heavily followed the charts. (which i deeply regret) 

i gradually got into mainstream electronic music, then into a subgenre called moombahton, and today i listen to dubstep. its been a crazy journey through music"
130,2020-02-04 21:39:14,eysgnq,"Anything but pop or Latin music   


I LOOOOVE 80s music, synth wave and metal"
131,2020-02-04 19:32:50,eysgnq,"Mostly symphonic/power metal. Bands include:

Kamelot, nightwish, iron savior, hammerfall, powerwolf, nocturnal rites, symphony x."
132,2020-02-04 20:00:55,eysgnq,Are you me??
133,2020-02-04 18:37:54,eysgnq,"Ever checked out this underground prog band, Darker Days Tomorrow? I love them."
134,2020-02-04 18:00:50,eysgnq,Ever tried listening to the enigma TNG?
135,2020-02-04 22:39:17,eysgnq,I recently started listening to witch house after discovering Ic3peak. Good stuff.
136,2020-02-05 03:18:50,eysgnq,I also listen to a lot of OSTs especially video game and anime music that I seem I like and I also listen to a rock and indie music as well
137,2020-02-04 18:53:51,eysgnq,I'd recommend Beautiful Lies by B-complex. As well as a band called Raised Fist.
138,2020-02-04 22:59:29,eysgnq,"I can identify with this.

I do listen to a good variety of other stuff. I can appreciate lots of music.  My GF listens to wildly different music than me on the norm (she's also an intj), but I like it when we drive around together."
139,2020-02-04 23:00:08,eysgnq,This is my study music. Or nature sounds.
140,2020-02-04 22:59:48,eysgnq,APC and KSE have my heart.
141,2020-02-04 20:16:08,eysgnq,A man of culture
142,2020-02-04 22:03:50,eysgnq,Like Miles Davis or Kenny G? ‚ÄòCause Jazz is BIG.
143,2020-02-05 01:06:40,eysgnq,Do you like rap as well? Been really into For Sale Interlude by Kendrick Lamar and God is Fair by Mac Miller recently. Any recommendations for Thelonious Monk tracks?
144,2020-02-05 00:41:32,eysgnq,I love Aurora do you like Paramore
145,2020-02-05 01:25:18,eysgnq,Porcupine Tree. I see you are a man of culture as well...
146,2020-02-04 20:47:34,eysgnq,upvoted for nevermore
147,2020-02-05 03:53:22,eysgnq,Aka that hard shit
148,2020-02-04 18:48:09,eysgnq,"I'm also like this! When people ask me what kind of music I listen to, I never know what to say because I listen to many different genres and I only like certain artists within that genre. Do you think this an xNFP thing?"
149,2020-02-05 01:15:04,eysgnq,"Right, like I mostly listen to jazz (modal especially) and folk music, but I really dig Lizzo right now, will never not blast Wu-Tang and Nas, and have a special spot in my heart for the greatest Scottish heavy metal pirate band Alestorm.  With that said, I dislike soft jazz, can't be bothered with most modern rap, pop folk is okay for background music, and I absolutely hate heavy metal"
150,2020-02-05 01:27:29,eysgnq,Polyphia and Plini are awesome. Check out I Built the Sky as well!
151,2020-02-04 23:08:05,eysgnq,"The Color Morale is good, I‚Äôve seen them before with MMF. Garett‚Äôs story/life is so sad."
152,2020-02-04 20:02:51,eysgnq,"not doubting validity but what about: The Witcher soundtrack, theme song from 'The Good Doctor' or even Scrubs, and the score from Primer ?"
153,2020-02-04 22:24:03,eysgnq,"The theme song for House is ""Teardrop"" lol"

156,2020-02-05 01:34:13,eysgnq,Trip hop is the study music I didn‚Äôt know I needed. Any recommendations? You should check out ‚ÄòIf You Want Me to Stay‚Äô by sly &the family stone and ‚ÄòFor Sale Interlude‚Äô by Kendrick Lamar if you haven‚Äôt heard them. Or maybe ‚ÄòRunning out of Time‚Äô by Tyler the creator is more your speed. It‚Äôs got a cool lofi vibe instrumental. Goosebumps and getting hooked on a song are the best
157,2020-02-05 01:36:00,eysgnq,"Yes, flow states !    
That harmonic vibratory bass that that brings on a stoic groundness.    
If you havent, try playing with poi."
158,2020-02-07 14:13:38,eysgnq,Currently enjoying Mick Gordon's output for Doom and Wolfenstein TNO
159,2020-02-07 14:26:50,eysgnq,The massed bands of the Edinburgh military tattoo.
160,2020-02-04 19:48:27,eysgnq,">(sometimes)

Sure"
161,2020-02-04 19:56:01,eysgnq,You're right but there does seem a big trend of rock/metal music. I would assume other people would have pop/hiphop/rap higher up. But we can't really tell unless unless someone asked every personality
162,2020-02-04 19:05:08,eysgnq,"Never heard of them before and I listened to a few songs just now; they have exactly a genre I really dig, something industrial with a touch of goth. Thank you for the great discovery!"
163,2020-02-04 18:17:37,eysgnq,"Yes! I discovered him back in 2015, God Complex is one my favourite tracks too."
164,2020-05-07 05:19:26,eysgnq,"Same. I too listen to videogame, anime and movie OSTs  as well as rock music. However, I haven't really tried Indie music, maybe I will someday."
165,2020-02-04 23:04:02,eysgnq,"I love Howard üò≠ Great band no matter who‚Äôs on vocals! APC is so good, too. Big fan of Billy, I think he‚Äôs SO underrated."
166,2020-02-05 02:16:22,eysgnq,THIS. DICK. AINT. FREEEEE!!!
167,2020-02-05 01:43:30,eysgnq,Not really.
168,2020-02-04 19:02:16,eysgnq,I thought it was an everyone thing!
169,2020-02-04 22:31:34,eysgnq,Same lol it‚Äôs a struggle
170,2020-02-05 03:40:48,eysgnq,Yarrr  ‚Äúwhat bands are you listening to‚Äù is a better question
171,2020-02-05 03:15:50,eysgnq,"Will do. Check out Intervals, Chon & David Maxim Micic too."
172,2020-02-05 03:17:15,eysgnq,I can't recall if I've seen them live honestly. I only started really getting into them recently. I played with MMF a long time ago though.
173,2020-02-05 01:31:24,eysgnq,"i had a ticket to the show in NYC, couldnt make it due to workload.  :("
174,2020-02-05 01:28:38,eysgnq,I think it is sarcasm
175,2020-02-04 19:40:54,eysgnq,Ok doomer
176,2020-02-05 01:52:08,eysgnq,"Oh yeah Tyler is a fantastic artist rapping and producing and he discovered a lot of artists I like like Kali Uches and Sid the Kid. Trip hop is definitely a love of mine. I think Portishead is like the group that defined trip hop and one of my favs. Chillledcow page on YouTube plays live lofi tunes to just sit and study to or whatever. Also Massive Attack, Sneaker Pimps, mmm so many. A lot I discovered from movies like the matrix or blade like Dj Krush track called Dig this Vibe was in Blade and I loved it. All of dj krush tracks from 90s are good. Lots of gold trip hop songs you‚Äôll find from the 90s"
177,2020-02-05 01:55:35,eysgnq,"Also Dj Shadow , Morcheeba, Tricky, Bonobo, Cibo Motto I could go on. I could send you some of my favorite tracks if you want"
178,2020-02-06 19:41:07,eysgnq,"I suppose you could call it a slow state, though I‚Äôm not too sure what the current definition of that is"
179,2020-02-05 00:31:55,eysgnq,No problem at all. I always love sharing cool artists I find. And it's even nicer when people enjoy the recommendations.
180,2020-02-04 23:17:14,eysgnq,"Howard was so good. I was skeptical when I heard Jesse came back, but every album has been progressively better. Second best album of 2019, after the newest As I Lay Dying album."
181,2020-02-05 02:24:03,eysgnq,Such a great album.
182,2020-02-05 18:14:31,eysgnq,Lorde?
183,2020-02-05 00:20:04,eysgnq,It is.
184,2020-02-05 15:07:31,eysgnq,"Idk... I know a lot of people who only like maybe 2-3 genres of music, and they only listen to that stuff. Maybe it also depends on the country you live in? idk lol"
185,2020-02-04 19:43:39,eysgnq,*There Is a Light That Never Goes Out starts playing in the background*
186,2020-02-05 02:15:10,eysgnq,"Portishead is cool, just read they influenced Radiohead. I really like Dig this Vibe. Yeah if you have some top tracks feel free to"
187,2020-02-19 19:50:12,eysgnq,Oh google flow states bro.  You'll be amazed at the pro psychiatric data !
188,2020-02-05 00:50:19,eysgnq,I‚Äôm a Wovenwar fan so I‚Äôm actually bummed about AILD getting back together üíî
189,2020-02-05 18:30:59,eysgnq,"I didn't know her, not bad. If you like her then you probably like Lana Del Rey.

Initially I thought you wrote ""Lorn"", which I like."
190,2020-02-05 02:41:43,eysgnq,I will go listen to Wovenwar while I numb the day with Xbox. Never gave them the chance I should have.
191,2020-02-05 18:34:26,eysgnq,Ye I listen to pretty much all music Lorde is one of my favs try Alessia cara then Sabrina. Claudio. I love Lana del Ray
192,2020-02-05 18:41:49,eysgnq,"I was forgetting, try LP - Lost On You"
193,2020-02-05 18:45:35,eysgnq,"I love it, try safe and sound by the civil wars"
194,2020-02-05 21:17:28,eysgnq,"It's ok, but I don't like Taylor Swift nor Civil Wars in general."

Unfold by Alana b."
196,2020-02-04 12:24:37,eym00e,22% of the votes? Damn I though a lotta people like Acid Rap. Post Big Day syndrome maybe?
197,2020-02-04 14:05:33,eym00e,"This format is going to end up a trainwreck because most people didn't listen to most of these albums, and 30 is just too much to choose from for an average opinion."
198,2020-02-04 11:18:43,eym00e,y'all wack af for voting TLOP first
199,2020-02-04 07:49:10,eym00e,Kids See Ghosts is not the album of the decade
200,2020-02-04 11:50:38,eym00e,"Whoever saying pi√±ata, it‚Äôs got some of the best production on an album this decade, you can‚Äôt vote that out"
201,2020-02-04 19:19:14,eym00e,damn there's no beach house on this list?
202,2020-02-04 23:45:44,eym00e,im just gonna stay out of voting til i know all the albums in
203,2020-02-04 14:13:56,eym00e,Damn I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much KSG hate on here
204,2020-02-04 08:48:47,eym00e,"any of pi√±ata, rodeo and yeezus could go out and i‚Äôd be ok"
205,2020-02-04 08:25:40,eym00e,"sorry Kids See Ghosts, it‚Äôs time"
206,2020-02-04 17:01:39,eym00e,"Imo, NFR or Yeezus should go, but damn that's a hard decision to make"
207,2020-02-04 23:43:52,eym00e,I feel like Yeezus just did not belong with the rest of these
208,2020-02-04 09:18:09,eym00e,"Before I get downvoted to oblivion, Think about it for a minute:

Random Accces Memories is one of the weaker albums here and should be eliminated in the next few rounds. It‚Äôs a good album coming from the legendary Daft Punk. But its tracklist isn‚Äôt as stacked as most of the albums on here, and has four of five tracks that are just good."
209,2020-02-04 09:31:22,eym00e,Channel orange soon. Blonde is infinitely better.
210,2020-02-04 08:30:44,eym00e,"I‚Äôm debating between Kids See Ghosts, Yeezus, and Lonerism"
211,2020-02-04 15:58:07,eym00e,Understandable
212,2020-02-04 17:21:44,eym00e,"FOR ME arcade fire, both tame impalas, mgmt and channel orange could go before this gets really really difficult. I like a lot of tracks on each of them but they just don‚Äôt stack up as real contenders for best of the decade"
213,2020-02-05 00:14:09,eym00e,NOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!
214,2020-02-05 00:28:07,eym00e,I'm conflicted about KSG because it's extremely good but only 23 minutes long.
215,2020-02-05 03:44:16,eym00e,"I don't care if you lot vote KSG, but don't vote Yeezus"
216,2020-02-07 04:50:54,eym00e,"Flower Boy was a weird inclusion on this list in the first place, that's got my vote. Some Rap Songs and Pinata right behind."
217,2020-02-04 08:55:36,eym00e,Pinata out
218,2020-02-04 17:11:57,eym00e,Pinata needs to go
219,2020-02-04 17:48:00,eym00e,Voting KSG till it‚Äôs out
220,2020-02-04 09:47:52,eym00e,Pinata out
221,2020-02-04 15:42:25,eym00e,his old stuff definitely doesn‚Äôt hit the same for me but i‚Äôd attribute that to being me 22 years old now more than the shitshow that was the big day
222,2020-02-04 17:06:58,eym00e,I agree. Too many albums. Which is why it‚Äôs hard to say what‚Äôs truly the best of the decade. Everyone has their own preference
223,2020-02-04 16:50:49,eym00e,"Yep, I still got to listen to the following:

Queens of the Stone Age - ...Like Clockwork

~~Frank Ocean - Blonde~~

Daughters - You Won‚Äôt Get What You Want

Lana Del Rey - Norman Fucking Rockwell!

Fleet Foxes - Helplessness Blues

Daft Punk - Random Access Memories

Sufjan Stevens - Carrie & Lowell

Travis Scott - Rodeo

David Bowie - Blackstar

LCD Soundsystem - This is Happening

Car Seat Headrest - Twin Fantasy"

225,2020-02-04 08:02:13,eym00e,It's all because of Antoine Fantoine and his MBDTF-shaped guilt
226,2020-02-04 20:58:18,eym00e,It's also not the worst album of the ones remaining.
227,2020-02-04 08:15:51,eym00e,Especially not among this lot.
228,2020-02-04 08:21:58,eym00e,TLOP > KSG 100/100 times
229,2020-02-04 08:07:03,eym00e,Idk man honestly I have such a deep connection with that album it‚Äôs one of my favorites. It‚Äôs a personal thing
230,2020-02-04 08:17:14,eym00e,Yes but it's still better than Yeezus
231,2020-02-04 11:39:39,eym00e,KSG is probably the most overrated album of the decade. Not even all that good.
232,2020-02-04 20:32:21,eym00e,"i mean, it's the best Kanye album this decade so"
233,2020-02-04 18:27:10,eym00e,"Madlib's production is awesome, but Gibbs isn't good"
234,2020-02-04 22:13:40,eym00e,"It‚Äôs not that I hate it, it‚Äôs just that it doesn‚Äôt deserve to be in an album of the decade list. Like I highly doubt it would get the praise it gets on here if Fantano didn‚Äôt give it a 10."

238,2020-02-04 13:20:58,eym00e,It‚Äôs better than half of these albums.
239,2020-02-04 10:08:26,eym00e,It‚Äôs an actively bad album.
240,2020-02-04 09:38:35,eym00e,This isn‚Äôt Blonde vs Channel Orange. Channel orange is also fantastic and beats a lot of the albums here
241,2020-02-04 18:28:13,eym00e,Channel orange is much better imo
242,2020-02-04 09:28:12,eym00e,"Why Lonerism tho, it's better than Currents"
243,2020-02-04 09:47:45,eym00e,Bad choices
244,2020-02-04 18:25:23,eym00e,Do it
245,2020-02-04 19:10:38,eym00e,Then just don‚Äôt vote on any of these. And try to vote with larger context in mind
246,2020-02-04 22:47:19,eym00e,Listen to Like Clockwork
247,2020-02-04 13:19:53,eym00e,This is just so wrong
248,2020-02-04 09:08:07,eym00e,"i don‚Äôt think so. KSG is dope, but Yeezus is a stronger body of work for me"
249,2020-02-04 16:47:31,eym00e,Hard disagree here. I rarely listen to KSG in full anymore but Yeezus is has been in relatively consistent rotation for me since it dropped.
250,2020-02-05 00:27:38,eym00e,"yeah, hard agree, it‚Äôs overrated as fuck

bottom tier kanye , i think WTT is way better"
251,2020-02-04 13:20:13,eym00e,It‚Äôs a fantastic album.
252,2020-02-05 03:02:26,eym00e,maybe if ur not a kanye fan
253,2020-02-05 00:28:42,eym00e,still no clue how anyone could think it‚Äôs a 10
254,2020-02-04 13:17:26,eym00e,neither is pi√±ata slander
255,2020-02-04 14:48:45,eym00e,You must not have listened to that half then
256,2020-02-04 09:47:31,eym00e,No it's not
257,2020-02-04 19:38:01,eym00e,Any suggestions on where to start?
258,2020-02-04 19:37:17,eym00e,I won't vote unless I've heard them all. So either I work through that list or I wait until they're all out.
259,2020-02-05 02:00:15,eym00e,"I will eventually. Idk, I've liked some of their songs but never enough to get an album."
260,2020-02-05 20:54:57,eym00e,"also,Kanye doesn't even do that well. Cudi carries it."
261,2020-02-04 18:08:35,eym00e,no. 7.
262,2020-02-05 03:58:45,eym00e,"Nah. MBDTF isn't even Kanye's best. It's just generally accepted as such because people always say it is without giving it much thought. In reality, he has multiple albums that are at least at the level of MBDTF, while TCD and KSG are both higher peaks"
263,2020-02-05 00:29:20,eym00e,wow sick burn
264,2020-02-04 13:21:25,eym00e,Yes it is
265,2020-02-04 19:39:46,eym00e,What are your favorite genres?
266,2020-02-04 21:55:03,eym00e,Listen to Blonde for great neo-soul/r&b with fantastic introspective lyrics
267,2020-02-04 21:09:28,eym00e,You'll have a long time to wait until Blonde is out. It's an obvious top 5
268,2020-02-05 04:09:40,eym00e,"nah. i agree TCD is about the same level as MBDTF. but Late Registration, Graduation, 808s, & Yeezus are all better than KSG. i put KSG same tier as TLOP and WTT, and Ye below them all

edit: and then Jesus Is King is below Ye"
269,2020-02-04 13:47:50,eym00e,"Most of this sub prefers Currents too, as seen in the brackets"
270,2020-02-04 20:58:43,eym00e,Well I love rap. I'm a big early Bowie fan but I was trying to go through his album chronologically. Past that I like psychadelic rock and weird electronic music.
271,2020-02-05 04:09:22,eym00e,Realistically this will be the first I listen to.
272,2020-02-04 21:22:58,eym00e,I should probably listen to that then. I did really like his older work.
273,2020-02-04 18:32:03,eym00e,Most of this sub is wrong
274,2020-02-04 21:08:18,eym00e,"Rodeo is the only rap album here, so you can start with it.
 
My personal favorite on your list is Carrie & Lowell, which is an amazing folk album.

Probably the most acclaimed album on the list is Blonde - it's considered the best R&B album since Prince's classics.

For psychedelic rock, there's nothing on this list."
275,2020-02-04 21:46:41,eym00e,"Daughters is likely to be the furthest from your personal tastes, but I like neither metal nor noise rock and found it an excellent listen.

If you like electronic, you gotta give This is Happening a go. It's often danceable, but very rock oriented and full of brilliant, bittersweet lyrics. It's a blast, especially if you like slow burn songs, as many tunes take a while to build but earn their time by the end."
276,2020-02-05 04:09:50,eym00e,Let me know what you think! It's one of my favorite albums
277,2020-02-07 19:39:18,eym00e,"I do like folk as well. I should delve further into that I think.

Listening to Blonde first but depending on my moods I may try Carrie & Lowell next."
278,2020-02-07 19:37:59,eym00e,"6 tracks in and I'm wondering why it took me so long to listen to this.

That said I'm also thinking maybe this is the perfect time in my life to listen to this."
279,2020-02-05 04:10:51,eym00e,Will do! Probably in next few days if not tomorrow.
280,2020-02-07 19:40:33,eym00e,"That's great to hear! It is an album that really resonated with me when I first listened it, especially considering where I was in life at the time. Some of my favorite tracks are on the second half of the record, so let me know what you think of it when you finish!"
281,2020-02-07 21:06:55,eym00e,It will take me a few listens to take it all in. I usually focus on the album sonically the first couple times then lyrics set in after. What lyrics I did pick up are mostly in the beginning when it had most of my focus. I enjoyed the whole thing though. Definitely going to get more play time from me.

287,2020-02-04 05:04:56,eyj0mc,"Honestly, if I could hear one ‚Äúscrapped‚Äù Kanye album completely finished, it‚Äôd be So Help Me God. As much as Pablo is a great album, I feel like the original version would‚Äôve been legendary and rivaled MBDTF and Yeezus as one of his greatest artistic endeavors. I Feel Like That is so fucking good dude for some reason it reminds me almost like what a modern 808s would sound like for him."

He just tells you he feels like that too. He, a superstar and my personal idol, has problems, he's weak sometimes, and that's ok. Everyone has low points.  


I will always be inspired by Kanye, he is an incredible human being."

301,2020-02-04 03:01:03,eyj0mc,fax dude its so good. Would have been a perfect interlude to Ye tbh

311,2020-02-04 15:42:41,eyj0mc,I mean Kanye was originally gonna have hey mama on CD but then he decided to put it on LR so yeah if it‚Äôs just sitting on his computer  I don‚Äôt see why he can‚Äôt

But tha album also was like 7 songs and it felt like he was barely on a couple of the songs."
320,2020-07-06 23:47:10,eygbwz,Ghost town is a top 3 Kanye song in my opinion
321,2020-02-06 03:57:40,eygbwz,"Christ,  anyone who actually would call Ye talentless has no idea what they‚Äôre talking about. MBDTF, College Dropout, Kids See Ghosts...etc. He has made incredible music for decades but just because of politics or other controversial aspects of his manic personality so many of you guys just lie about him."
322,2020-02-03 23:45:13,eygbwz,"For sure but even though he wasn‚Äôt on them much, they‚Äôre still all great songs imo"

If that‚Äôs the case then just admit you have no case against his music and leave this comment alone. Regardless I did bring up three albums, ranging from releasing in the early 2000s all the way to 2018 that were all great. I doubt you‚Äôve listened to any of them which is fine but don‚Äôt act like he‚Äôs talentless if you don‚Äôt listen."

334,2020-02-03 21:34:25,eycxzu,I‚Äôll admit I have a pool and maybe use it 5 x a summer. My husband forces himself to go in. But it is great for kids and entertaining
335,2020-02-03 20:45:29,eycxzu,"I thought that initially too, but she said the kids and cousins use it all the time, although she did make it seem like they really only use the stairs. Also conflicted on them saying instead of having a jacuzzi they just keep the whole pool warm all the time, seems like a waste of energy, but so would building a whole separate jacuzzi I guess."
336,2020-02-04 01:38:17,eycxzu,My fav is their living space that has the glass and the green wall outside it. Love that!

338,2020-02-03 23:48:56,eycxzu,"OK I get that people don't tend to use their own pools that often. (I'm in the UK and a pool at home has always seemed like such a luxurious American thing to have! Our gardens are small and it rains all the time here ok. Let me dream!) 

But to not even have tried it out?? Not to just see how it feels to swim in the pool even once? I don't know how much that pool cost but likely hundreds of thousands of dollars, right? To be able to spend all that money and then not even have the slightest curiosity to use it? That's mad to me. That pool probably cost as much as an apartment."
339,2020-02-04 16:44:09,eycxzu,"I bet the kids use it. My mom didn't like to swim as much cause she would ruin her hair. I bet that is why Kim doesn't. All that work she puts into her hair and makeup would be ruined in a second. 

My family was lucky to have a pool when I was in HS. We were in it all the time and always had friends come over to swim. We also lived in S. TX where it is hot and humid 24/7. The pool was my favorite thing in HS. Hopefully I can have one day!"
340,2020-02-04 06:13:20,eycxzu,Bet she can't swim... but i'm sure she can float.

342,2020-02-04 02:06:04,eycxzu,think of the stairs as a shallow end. it's definitely more fun for the little kids to splash around and stuff.

391,2020-02-04 18:42:46,eya26g,"Nice to see some love for my underappreciated girls like Anna of the North, L√•psley and Empress Of. And Chromatics! One of my favourite bands ever."
392,2020-02-04 19:07:20,eya26g,Love to see the yuna and teyana shout outs ! 2 slept on queens tbh
393,2020-02-10 12:03:28,eya26g,"Thank you so much for this list! I tend to listen to the same music over and over, so you've helped me expand my horizon. I hadn't even listened to a lot of the more ""mainstream"" artists here, actually. Through your list, I discovered Shura's music, and she's been on repeat the past week. Can't get enough of the latest album, especially ""Side Effects"" and ""Religion"". What a fantastic 1-2 punch."
394,2020-02-11 11:25:17,eya26g,is it bad i still prefer the leaked Yandhi version of We Got Love?
395,2020-02-04 17:16:09,eya26g,"Listening to this playlist now, there's some good stuff in here! However:

>**Shygirl - Uckers**  
>  
>for fans of Azealia Banks  
>  
>**The main hook of this track is a looping, unfurling bloodcurdling screech** that makes for one of the most interesting beats of 2019. It‚Äôs like Cupcakke meets Clipping. and it‚Äôs every bit as jarring and magical as it sounds, somehow managing to sound both sexy and disturbing.

This is one of the most unpleasant songs I have listened to in a long, long time. Why did you do this to me"
396,2020-02-03 18:19:27,eya26g,"Maybe on this sub, but SVE had a great 2019 and that album received near unanimous praise. And she deserves it !"
397,2020-02-03 20:50:18,eya26g,it made its way into sex education season 2 and that‚Äôs all i could ever hope for

399,2020-02-03 18:09:04,eya26g,Easy Breezy and Mad at Me better be on said album
400,2020-02-04 02:58:57,eya26g,I'd also recommend Shawty by Kiana and What You Did by Mahalia ft. Ella Mai to anyone who's interested in these underrated artists! What You Did reminds me of early 2000's RnB if you're a big fan of that era of music.
401,2020-02-03 20:08:38,eya26g,"Anyways, kind of surprised you compared V√âRIT√â to Sigrid, but I'm fans of both of them so maybe it makes sense."
402,2020-02-03 17:18:52,eya26g,"Thank you! I‚Äôm curious though, which songs didn‚Äôt you like? There‚Äôs a few on here I‚Äôm less enthused about but I always like to create a healthy mix of tracks!"
403,2020-02-04 00:39:03,eya26g,">if people are unfamiliar with Hatchie

""Sure"" is also a great track by her. Shimmery and summery vibes."
404,2020-02-03 18:09:50,eya26g,I actually met her at her album release party and she‚Äôs a sweetheart I was just 10 glasses of ros√© in and was so awkward lol

406,2020-02-03 17:21:54,eya26g,"I heard ""SG Lewis - Flames (feat. Ruel)"" for the Jukebox and thought it was very dull, didn't care much for ""L√•psley - My Love Was Like The Rain"" either though that was mostly because it felt like a disappointment compared to her debut."
407,2020-02-04 00:47:57,eya26g,"Hatchie doesn't have many songs, and they are all pretty excellent :]"
408,2020-02-04 12:46:55,eya26g,"Honestly there isn't a song by them I don't like, Volumes I and II were both so solid"
409,2020-02-03 17:23:42,eya26g,I‚Äôll be honest that SG Lewis song was probably my least favorite on the list (you can check my jukebox review too haha) but I like the synth wave sound and I think both artists are about to blow up so its definitely worth including
410,2020-02-03 22:41:29,eya26g,"that‚Äôs interesting, my love was like the rain blew me away and personally knocked falling short off as the top track for me. to put it in perspective falling short was my most listened track in 2015. what are your faves from her?"
411,2020-02-03 22:45:30,eya26g,"I'm basic: ""Operator"" and ""Love Is Blind"""

420,2020-02-04 02:22:32,ey8b4b,What the fuck just appeared in front of me
421,2020-02-03 14:10:13,ey7l55,"can someone explain to me how this house worth jumped from 20m to 60m in less than a year, also i wonder how much the house worth now after all the changes they did ?"
422,2020-02-03 15:00:42,ey7l55,Why do they always show the same three rooms ü§î
423,2020-02-03 14:10:28,ey7l55,That was an interesting read.  I think the house is very reflective of their relationship dynamic.  Before Kim married Kanye she had a lot more fun with her personal style.  Her old house and the clothes/makeup she used to wear were totally different than they are now and she loved to play with colors and glam elements.  She really changed her entire style to match Kanye's.  I'm not going to speculate whether she's happy with that decision or not but I do think it's very interesting.  To me it's clear this house is like 95% Kanye's taste and 5% Kim's.
424,2020-02-03 14:09:24,ey7l55,"So beautiful I mean that‚Äôs a given, but the all white is sooooo strange haha. I believe another followers opinion on here that they think half of the house has color and stuff. And what‚Äôs seen is just to put on the show."
425,2020-02-03 17:30:16,ey7l55,"I want to see the kids‚Äô rooms so bad


Edit. Yayyy we got norths room!"
426,2020-02-04 07:45:24,ey7l55,"Okay, I love it. When I first saw it I was like. Nah, that's no house, but of course we're not seeing the full house (for privacy reasons, they probably shouldn't, although I'm soo curious). Now, seeing the AD article, really makes me want to jump in and see all of Kanye and Axel's ideas! 

That being said, as a super messy artist that loves ceramic titles and crazy wall paper prints, all the tones of white really make me want to add color on the hallway walls and rooms. Otherwise it's very cool and serene."
427,2020-02-04 18:40:37,ey7l55,"its funny that she wasn't even sure of what to call the room they were sitting in the for the interview.  I think that is also  very telling of their home design choices. She defers to him for his inspiration, and his extensive knowledge and expertise in design. 

I just find in that video that he's so sweet and kind and she seems annoyed with him. That was uncomfortable a bit.

With that said the house is so beautiful and calming . I love it."
428,2020-02-03 16:39:31,ey7l55,"It was 20 mil and out of nowhere Kris said it was 60 mil, and now that number is everywhere. It‚Äôs going to be embarrassing when they won‚Äôt be able to sell it for 60 mil"
429,2020-02-03 16:18:06,ey7l55,"There's no way that place is worth 60 mil. I love it, but nothing in that area is worth that much unless they have enormous amounts of land attached in the back or something. There are better houses on the most expensive streets in bel air that aren't worth that much."
430,2020-02-03 18:07:07,ey7l55,"I believe they bought an adjacent plot which increased the value. But it‚Äôs still not worth 60m, that‚Äôs just a Kris-ism. Maybe it‚Äôs insured for 60m including all furnishings, art, valuables, etc. No way they can sell this for that much when it‚Äôs four times the value of the average house in their neighborhood."
431,2020-02-04 12:28:08,ey7l55,agreed
432,2020-02-03 17:04:07,ey7l55,That would be crazy! I remember they showed North's room and it looked like a rock cave and it was tiny. I remember Kim mentioning the kids have a play room so there must be color in there at least.
433,2020-02-03 16:44:23,ey7l55,It is probably worth 15-20 mil ish looking at comparable properties in the area. I don't understand the need for such a large lie. Like saying its 25 or something I would get if they wanted to flex but putting 40 million imaginary dollars on? Lmao. Silliness.
434,2020-02-03 19:07:52,ey7l55,Update:  Kim just posted a picture of North's bedroom and its bright pink.  They must have recently redid it.
435,2020-02-03 16:52:06,ey7l55,"I know, at most double the 20 and push it up to 40 mil. But Kris really went overboard for no reason. It was so unnecessary too, she retweeted an article and said it‚Äôs 60 mil. It was so stupid"
436,2020-02-03 21:35:07,ey7l55,Lol that‚Äôs funny!!
437,2020-02-03 16:56:17,ey7l55,"They expanded it a lot. I think the original was 20 mil, now it‚Äôs 40 mil. No WAY is it 60 mil."
438,2020-03-28 16:11:12,fqm565,"I absolutely think everything Donald has done with this album and its release has been 100% intentional. To drop a whole project (in the middle of a global disaster) that essentially sums up the essence and parasitism of humanity through the lens of being a father in this world. This album is definitely it, 3.15.20 is Donald‚Äôs masterpiece. Stylistically, I don‚Äôt think his father‚Äôs passing necessarily influenced his sound because after listening to this project over and over again, I think AML was such a necessary predecessor to this album so we could be introduced to this more psychedelic, visceral Gambino era. His father‚Äôs passing, however, was the whole reason for this album‚Äôs concept. I think Donald has been completely silent during this whole rollout on purpose. The completely blank album cover and lack of names for the songs force us to really pay attention and absorb everything he is saying, reading in between the lines. At the end of the day, my take on 3.15.20 is that the whole concept is a double entendre of a sort‚Äî 1) A Book of Life and 2) the story of a Father."

Please keep in mind the title tag must be typed IN THE TITLE of your post and retain their SQUARE brackets as shown below, on Reddit Redesign and old reddit you still must type it into the title, you cannot select your tag anywhere, you must type it!

All posts on the subreddit require at a minimum of one tag surrounded by square brackets in the title to describe what kind of content it is, these are the only current tags you can use and they are case-sensitive & spelling sensitive, so check the spelling and brackets on your title if you continue to get this message.

The allowed tags are as follows: [Non-LGBT] [Crushes] [Article] [Picture] [Video] [Audio] [Rant] [Sexual Health] [Coming Out] [Family/Friends] [Discussion] [Relationships]

If you are still confused on how to use the tag system all you do is pick at least one of the above tags, then place the written tag somewhere in your post title (Do not forget the square brackets surrounding each tag [] ) here are some correct & incorrect titles to help you out.

Example correct title: I found out my crush likes me! [Crushes]
Notice the square brackets and capitalization and correct spelling!

Example correct title: [Coming Out] [Family/Friends] How do I come out?
Notice the spelling/brackets & capitalization is consistent and location of the tags do not matter.

Example incorrect title: I found out my crush likes me! (Crushes)
Notice the parentheses instead of square brackets 

Example incorrect title: Anyone else find Tom Holland stupidly hot? [Dicsussion]
Notice the misspelled Discussion

Once you have a correct title with a tag all you have to do is submit the post and the bot will do the rest for you and now users can sort your content by the tags! If you have any more questions feel free to contact the moderators in ModMail.

480,2020-03-28 10:22:23,fqdkwn,"I've been trying out these sounds lately a lot. It has a lot with degrading it by digital compression (as in file compression, not audio compression).There's different ways achieve this, saving it to a 32kpbs mp3 for example to create these grain artifacts.But the easiest way I do it is this:

1. Pitch the signal up like +2 semitones
2. Load up Izotope RX Denoiser (or any denoiser that works similiar) and ""Learn"" the signal.Pitch the signal back down again.Set the settings to fastest and worse quality, musical noise, play around with the settings  until you hear the artifacts.
3. EQ/Multiband compress if a lot of the highs disappear.
4. Add room reverb. (Try putting this first in the chain if it sounds cool also).

logic has a plugin called Spectral gate that  does the trick too, but not as cool sounding imo  


Edit: [https://www.mboxdrive.com/ATKANHYE.mp3](https://www.mboxdrive.com/ATKANHYE.mp3) quick mock-up of the effect. It really depends on the original recording of course to get the right  result. Here's only using a  software piano. Applying it to a real recording will probably get  you more of those nasty nice overtones you're looking for.   


Also didn't really explain why you should pitch the signal up before the denoiser:   
The goal is to filter out harmonics in the audio to create these artifacts, so if you pitch the signal up previously and teach  the denoiser to eliminate  those harmonics (and then pitch  it back down again) you'll get various result on the harmonics of the original signal."
481,2020-03-28 13:55:29,fqdkwn,"It's funny how nowadays we find cool sounds that for ages sound engineers found viscerally disgusting. That sound has the watery weird sound of overly-denoised signals that makes me wince. I'm pretty sure it was a shitty noisy recording and he denoised it and thought it sounded cool. There's not much more to it I think.

It reminds me of the (much more interesting sound, to me) piano that comes in at 30 secs on this track:

[Nine Inch Nails ‚Äì Adrift & At Peace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRW50ziyfbY)

Slightly wonky and out of tune but ominous instead of just watery.

Most of the new producers find new sounds by just fucking up the signal with digital tools ‚Äì basically be overly aggressive with stuff and you might find an interesting, novel sound yourself. From that to it sounding *good,* well..."
482,2020-03-28 11:32:35,fqdkwn,"Tip: Dead Duck Software's free bitcrusher lets you easily degrade audio as if it's being run through lossy file compression, since the bit depth and sample rate settings are very similar to those available when encoding mp3 - instead of setting the sample rate to just whatever arbitrary value you put in, it snaps to common sample rates for mp3 audio compression, and the quantization is in bits. It also means that the signal doesn't need to be pitched up and then brought back down again, you can just halve the sample rate from what you'd use if you were pitching up the sample (eg. if you'd normally pitch the sample up an octave and use the standard 41kHz sample rate, you can instead use 20.5kHz and leave the sample pitch alone). 

Some advice for better understanding sample rates and bitcrushing [Read up on the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem](http://195.134.76.37/applets/AppletNyquist/Appl_Nyquist2.html). It's not just for DSP nerds, and will help you to more solidly understand how and why sample rate reduction affects sound."
483,2020-03-31 00:37:27,fqdkwn,Thank you so much. Really appreciate your in depth response. Made it a whole lot easier to approach the sound I'm going for. Thanks again :)
484,2020-03-28 19:01:57,fqdkwn,He was right. It does sound cool.
485,2020-03-31 01:03:07,fqdkwn,"I really appreciate your insight and showing the wide spectrum of sound this denoised signal technique can help create i.e. NIN - Adrift & At Peace. I'll keep in mind your discretion with these sounds, they may sound interesting, though they might not sound good, per se."
486,2020-03-28 11:41:54,fqdkwn,Very  good! Gonna check  this  plug out. Fabfilter recently put out a  video on oversampling in plugins that talk about the same stuff as well! [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jCwIsT0X8M)
487,2020-03-28 04:22:13,fqd33u,Still new to this mod stuff lmao but I‚Äôm pretty sure those links can be regularly posted. The concern is when it involves direct links to leaks.
488,2020-03-28 05:14:10,fqd33u,Nah I like it... didn‚Äôt know people didn‚Äôt like the actual cover
489,2020-03-28 05:09:50,fqd33u,"I actually worked with someone at this printing place and he was one of the higher ups who works with Ye on products and designs. Him and his team were actually responsible on the vinyl, cassettes, patches(?), and some unused designs of angels and clouds for apparel I assume. He couldn‚Äôt tell me much but he said there wasn‚Äôt any real meaning to the album cover when I asked it was just picked out by Ye but nothing was openly shared as to why just that ‚Äúhe liked it‚Äù the most. So your assumption can be correct on Ye‚Äôs terms but design wise that wasn‚Äôt its initial intent.

I just see a vinyl because I realized vinyl records sorta mean a lot to Kanye when it comes to his background. He has sampled a lot of soul and gospel I‚Äôm assuming it was sorta just a means of purity to go with that but nothing more than the meaning behind the Yeezus cover which is relatively easy to understand. Also blue is a spiritual color in the Bible representing the healing power of God but that‚Äôs also a very easy thing to understand if you‚Äôre Christian."
490,2020-03-28 05:10:24,fqd33u,"No, you‚Äôre actually just looking into things that aren‚Äôt there. The text on the vinyl itself is taken from another religious music vinyl. It‚Äôs a lazy ass mockup of a vinyl disc, not even a real disc.

The only obvious line of thought was that the music was supposed to stand for itself like with Yeezus."
491,2020-03-28 05:05:11,fqd33u,"My main problem with the cover is how poorly put together it looks. I'm not even sure they used an actual Vinyl disk asset, it literally looks like it was made.in Illustrator. The text doesn't look like it's a part of the disk at all, it looks clearly pasted overtop, and the hole is way too crisp. It's just bad graphic design overall, that's always been my issue with it.

Also, sorry to self-promote, but I made my own version that essentially proves [proves my point](https://www.reddit.com/r/YeAlbumCovers/comments/fefmxh/jesus_is_king_remastered_14001400/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). The idea isn't bad at all, but the execution is sloppy, and seems lazy."
492,2020-03-28 14:15:07,fqd33u,"That WSJ article talks about his affinity for circles as of late, so while it might be deeper I think he just does everything on a whim these days. It may work for him in fashion but I miss when all his music seemed so layered and intricate (and I liked JIK, just doesn‚Äôt hit the same). He has incorporated a lot of circles into the aesthetics of this era though (Coachella, turrell film, LA forum) so you could definitely be on to something. Or he‚Äôs just into Circles right nowü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

497,2020-03-28 15:49:30,fqd33u,"Oh yeah, I'm not saying the art itself isn't lazy. It looks like it was put together on Photoshop in 30 seconds. I'm saying I don't think it's meaningless though (and I've had this on my mind since the album came out)."
498,2020-03-28 20:18:29,fqd33u,Your version looks 10x better!
499,2020-03-28 15:50:46,fqd33u,I don't see it.
500,2020-03-28 04:38:03,fqd33u,Direct links towards everything else should be fine. Only leaks because that can be traced back. No idea why that was taken down.
501,2020-03-28 05:08:59,fqd33u,"You should be fine. If you could edit to take the spaces out, it would make things a lot easier. Good post, well thought-out."
502,2020-03-28 04:26:53,fqd33u,Ohh for sure.

Unless the buyer created a fake"
512,2020-03-28 05:32:59,fqc4nh,u/grailedofficial please respond to this
513,2020-03-28 05:44:28,fqc4nh,"This is a scam, no money was ever sent. It was sent from a fake email address too. Did you happen to ever give out your email address? There isn‚Äôt much you can do to cover yourself if you‚Äôve already shipped"
514,2020-03-28 06:00:49,fqc4nh,Yeah you got scammed. Same guy did something similar with PayPal to me saying that the funds ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt be in my account yet‚Äù
515,2020-03-28 04:55:56,fqc4nh,upload a pic of the email
516,2020-03-28 05:15:26,fqc4nh,did you try contacting the buyer ?

518,2020-03-28 15:13:18,fqc4nh,"To prevent this from happening next time, download the PayPal app on your phone and link it to your Grailed account. 

Every time I buyer pays (even if you‚Äôre a new seller and they have to hold your money), you‚Äôll get a notification saying that you received money. Never, ever ship if you don‚Äôt see any payment or withheld payment on PayPal. I‚Äôm really sorry that you got scammed, but if you exercise caution (follow my tip above) this won‚Äôt happen again."
519,2020-03-28 17:31:52,fqc4nh,"You can contact the courier company and attempt to turn back the shipment or stop it. I have done that in the past with mixed success because sometimes I shipped and they charged back their card.

Also, grailed won't ever do much for you. Its paypal that guarantees you."
520,2020-03-28 17:51:33,fqc4nh,This listing you have linked has not sold. Please do not ship the item. Shoot us an email to [help@grailed.com](mailto:help@grailed.com) with any relevant info and we can look into this further.
521,2020-03-28 03:08:12,fqc4nh,"The email saying it was sold was an email from grailed, keep in mind"
522,2020-03-28 06:30:22,fqc4nh,Sad and pathetic. Grow up a little bit before you try again.
523,2020-03-28 05:24:07,fqc4nh,"grailed would be useless here.

open a dispute with paypal if u have not recieved funds yet. they will direct u to a live agent, trust me they are very good at handling bullshit like this :) hope i helped and update us about this"
524,2020-03-28 08:02:13,fqc4nh,Damn bro ur retarded you got emailed with a fake Grailed email
525,2020-03-28 05:05:14,fqc4nh,"First time selling, said the the sale was confirmed, gave me the address, said I‚Äôd have the money soon."
526,2020-03-28 05:23:05,fqc4nh,"money does not get released into your account until 3 days after the item arrives if it is your first couple times selling. As u build up a good reputation, those 3 days will be shortened down."
527,2020-03-28 05:06:04,fqc4nh,"This is all I got, it‚Äôs still not marked as sold https://imgur.com/4aqMyvw"
528,2020-03-28 05:40:05,fqc4nh,"click details on the email, it will show the real email address it was sent from. That‚Äôs a scam email"
529,2020-03-28 05:47:44,fqc4nh,I did give out my email yes I fell for the whole thing

533,2020-03-28 17:59:34,fqc4nh,It‚Äôs already shipped...
534,2020-03-28 03:12:06,fqc4nh,But did you give anyone your email and did you confirm the email address as something @grailed.com
535,2020-03-28 06:30:56,fqc4nh,?
536,2020-03-28 06:31:50,fqc4nh,What are you talking about?
537,2020-03-28 05:48:08,fqc4nh,What were you thinking? Lol. PayPal doesn‚Äôt do pro bono work helping sellers chase money that were never paid in the first place.
538,2020-03-28 05:25:08,fqc4nh,Thank you I will give it a try
539,2020-03-28 05:25:23,fqc4nh,But the thing is I haven‚Äôt even received funds yet
540,2020-03-28 08:04:07,fqc4nh,First time selling also no need for the insults.

542,2020-03-28 05:29:19,fqc4nh,But it‚Äôs not even marked as sold.
543,2020-03-28 05:18:44,fqc4nh,"This is a scam email, not from Grailed. What‚Äôs the sender‚Äôs email address?"
544,2020-03-28 05:43:23,fqc4nh,"grailedautomailer@gmail.com, fraud email...."
545,2020-03-28 06:01:53,fqc4nh,No sir. I called PayPal before I shipped it out to make sure the email was legit and they denied it. What was the email address they sent it from?
546,2020-03-28 05:20:27,fqc4nh,damn :/ yeah he maybe did something i have no idea. you tried calling grailed's customer service rather than emailing them
547,2020-03-28 15:25:47,fqc4nh,"It‚Äôs not even that. The main issue is that PayPal has absolutely nothing to do with this scam because they were never contacted and money never entered or left anyone‚Äôs PayPal account. They would be useless in this situation. The only thing they may be able to do is cross-reference the scammer‚Äôs email with a list of PayPal registered addresses to see if there is an account. They could then see if that account has a lot of strikes or reports against and if it does, maybe they could block the scammer‚Äôs account. 

That‚Äôs a big ‚Äúif‚Äù though because it‚Äôs assuming the seller has a PayPal account with that email, and this scam does not require contact with PayPal. It bets on the idea that a seller will ship without looking at their PayPal to see that no payment was actually made."
548,2020-03-28 05:27:49,fqc4nh,"also, provide the screenshot with ur dispute and a screenshot of it being sold and a screenshot of your message history. dont forget to mention that the buyer blocked you. 

After this, the buyer has around 10 days to respond to this dispute, if he/she doesn't paypal will automatically be in your favor and give u the money. 
If there is a red slash through the name of the buyer, that is not blocked, rather deleted by grailed due to suspicious shit. Their paypal would also be on lockdown until everything is cleared."
549,2020-03-28 13:48:28,fqc4nh,Is it your first time on earth too?
550,2020-03-28 05:58:18,fqc4nh,I didn‚Äôt realize that until now my bad
551,2020-03-28 05:35:14,fqc4nh,"in this case, this was probably an exploit on  grailed's end. contact grailed, ive already tagged their user in reddit on this post so they will be aware of this situation."
552,2020-03-28 05:20:20,fqc4nh,How do you know it‚Äôs a scam email
553,2020-03-28 05:20:10,fqc4nh,"It shows as it‚Äôs from grailed, there‚Äôs no one else email on there"
554,2020-03-28 15:19:59,fqc4nh,"The official email when you sell an item is, ‚Äúno-reply@grailed.com‚Äù

It‚Äôs an automated email every time you sell an item. You should also see the funds in your account. The email address listed above is not Grailed‚Äôs."
555,2020-03-28 06:15:39,fqc4nh,It was a fake email
556,2020-03-28 05:20:54,fqc4nh,Yes and they must not be there because no one answers
557,2020-03-28 06:59:42,fqc4nh,that's not the real grailed email... you can check on their website for their actual email.
558,2020-03-28 05:33:34,fqc4nh,It‚Äôs from Help Grailed <xxx@xxx.com>. Anyone can create an email account and name it Grailed. You need to check their email address. This is a typical scam that would first ask for your email address and then disguise as either PayPal or the marketplace through an email to ask you to ship the item in order to release fund.
559,2020-03-28 06:30:05,fqc4nh,doesn't grailed offer money back guaranteed tho? i think the virus isn't helping either might be why no ones there

/r/Videos requires that your account be older than 7 days in order to submit content here. This is a spam-prevention method ***and cannot be waived***.

Please feel free to submit once your account is over 7 days old. You may also want to consider our minimum karma requirement of at least 10 of each type - [explained here](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204511829-What-is-karma) - so that you don't run into any further issues.

Unfortunately your account is either brand new and/or does not have enough karma to post content to funnyvideos at this time. We require users to have a minimum of 10 karma and be at least 5 days old. We suggest you comment in some popular threads and submit links to other subreddits to build up your karma and then come back.

The purpose of this approach is to ensure posters are users of Reddit, and not just content promoters. Note that using only r/AskReddit or r/FreeKarma4U may result in future manual removals, as this defeats the purpose of the requirements.

We are sorry for any inconvenience caused and look forward to your submissions in the future.

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash "" - "", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:

**If you are not posting music, please resubmit with the appropriate tag in the title:**

646,2020-03-27 20:42:59,fq5a2n,"Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

Conservatives think he was a no-good immoral thug who turned into a humble Christian man. On the surface that seems true considering Kanye went from saying Bush hated black people to supporting Trump and making gospel albums. But in reality, he's always been an out of the box guy who bursted on the scene in a pink polo rapping about something than gangs and drugs.  He's been about searching for motivation and establishing his true unique self in the face of tragedy, disillusionment, and obstacles. Some of those obstacles are self-made because he's a deeply flawed man (as most of us are), but at the end of the day he realizes these flaws make him who he is and he isn't going to waste time fitting someone's pre-drawn image of him. 

I encourage people here to listen to some of his work. He is truly a musical genius and revolutionary in his field and even if you don't like conventional rap, there are plenty to choose from."

100% right. And faith in Christ changes you from the inside out, in my experience. 

For a long time I was an atheist. Then I had a few personal tragedies hit and nihilism just wasn't cutting it for me anymore. To make a very long story short, I finally found my way to Jesus Christ and I can tell that the holy spirit has been working in me, and continues to transform me from the inside out.

How can you harbor animosity towards anyone, once you know that they're an equally worthy child of God, just like you? How can you continue to lie or be deceitful when everyone you meet is your brother or sister? How would you act if you knew that every action you take (or fail to take) has a moral character to it?

Sure, people will mock you for your ""superstitious beliefs,"" but honestly who cares what they think? If anything, they need your prayers more than most people. Antonin Scalia put it best:

I still kinda believe the statement overall....it explains the 6 months of the pretty much the same colorway dropping....it meant (to a point) that if you wanted Yeezy's you could get a pair without breaking the bank.

It's not like the Pharrell line where's it's ALL creativity so Adidas gotta keep the price high because P stays with bunches of colors and materials."

802,2020-04-22 12:33:07,g596uk,"When he said this, it was in reference to Nike pricing the Air Yeezy II at $350 and making it hyper limited.

At the time (and this is important because Kanye of 2015 is not Kanye of 2019), he was frustrated because he thought a collab with a major brand like Nike would let him build his own Jordan brand. Jordan Brand makes several of GR shoes (as in shoes available to all retailers and able to be re-ordered) all off the name of one man. Kanye wanted to do the same thing. He conceded that they‚Äôd have to have limited models in the beginning, to build hype (a Jordan Brand playbook move), but could do broad releases moving forward. Instead Nike told him they couldn‚Äôt price the shoe at the <$200 price point and that they couldn‚Äôt be released in larger quantities.

Now, here‚Äôs a fun history lesson:

When Kanye went to adidas, they did the same thing. Limited releases in the beginning to build hype and then steadily moving to GR status with the Creams. But the Creams sat for a long time and Adidas was learning a hard lesson with the Ultraboost line that was starting to sit on their shelves.

So, starting in 2019, Yeezy and Adidas split the difference. Instead of GR Yeezys, they‚Äôd release Yeezys in rapid succession in slightly different colorways. That way, they still sell out, but everyone that wants a pair can get a pair."

852,2020-04-21 13:25:00,g596uk,"The Yeezy line peaked interest in Adidas as a whole. NMDs, Ultraboosts, etc., wouldn't have had nearly the hype if it wasn't for the success of West's initial releases imo. Anything around the $150-$250 price point in Adidas Boost was selling out. In hindsight, it would make sense if Adidas offered Kanye a LARGE stake, but that's not how business works, and there's no arbitration going on.

5% is lower than I thought, especially since IIRC Adidas sort of swooped in and snatched a frustrated Kanye from Nike...thought they made him a ridiculous offer."

858,2020-04-21 18:53:50,g596uk,Well then I stand corrected. I was not aware that Jordan‚Äôs stake was only 5%!

860,2020-04-21 19:42:41,g596uk,"Alright I'm wrong, Jordan gets 25% but he and Kanye are the only ones getting royalties in general, rather than lump sums. Kanye also owns Yeezy, which is a huge boon for him, rather than being a subsidiary of Adidas like Jordan Brand is to Nike."
861,2020-04-21 19:57:37,g596uk,"So it's a licensing deal, Kanye owns the brand and Adidas fronts the cost of manufacturing, marketing and distribution"

Hello, 

I've been thinking about this for a while. 

Back in 2009, I was in college and the Kanye West ""Imma let you finish"" meme was in full swing and a huge running joke on my campus. My friend and I basically went as the meme: we printed out pictures of Taylor Swift and Kanye West's face and glued it to cereal boxes, cut out the eyes and wore it as masks on Halloween. I also had a polo shirt with a popped collar and a handmade microphone. I didn't really get any push back that evening (the only criticism I got is that the costume was kind of lazy, but even so a lot of people enjoyed it and we were asked to do the bit several times at each party, even found a Beyonce or two to play off of). I went to a fairly mixed race school in NYC.

This probably goes without saying, but I'm white. I've been trying to challenge myself on my past unintentional transgressions against the black community. The definition of blackface is kind of changing now, but I've always known it's wrong to have a costume of a race stereotype (being a generic ""black person"" or ""Mexican"") and usually the controversy is about wearing makeup (if you look it up online, those are most of the references you find). Here, I was trying to be a specific celebrity from a specific pop culture moment, and cut out the mask like I would have for any celebrity (my friends and I used to do this for group costumes from a particular movie, like Back to the Future or Grease). This celebrity though, was a different race than me.

Mask basically looked like this one:

[https://www.unwelcomegreetings.com/products/happy-kanye-west-mask-perfect-for-halloween-costume-party-mask-masquerades-parties-festivals-concerts-jumbo-size-waterproof-laminated-mask?variant=17514727425](https://www.unwelcomegreetings.com/products/happy-kanye-west-mask-perfect-for-halloween-costume-party-mask-masquerades-parties-festivals-concerts-jumbo-size-waterproof-laminated-mask?variant=17514727425)

Regardless of the answer here, I would never do it again, since even the chance someone could be offended by it is meaningful enough for me to just find a different costume. 

tldr: Are wearing masks of black celebrities blackface? AITA?

921,2020-05-03 16:21:28,gcssz7,"NTA you went out as a meme, you didn't go out in blackface as a generic black person or whatever.  I cannot believe anybody was actually offended by this, and I doubt a black person would have been, more likely a white person on their behalf, like you see a lot of on the internet.  You didn't do blackface, you had a mask."
922,2020-05-03 15:53:00,gcssz7,"NTA? If you painted your face black, that would be blackface. You wore a cereal box on your head with a cutout of his literal face. Not blackface."

Since you‚Äôre clearly having some sort of existential ‚Äúwoke‚Äù crisis, no, wearing a homemade mask of a specific person isn‚Äôt blackface."

Meanwhile, Daft Punk is the most sought-after live act in the world. Their 2006-2007 tour was so legendary, people still talk about it and wish they could go back in time and experience it for themselves. It raised the bar for what people thought dance shows could be. The live album from that tour (Alive 2007) was so good, people often call it the best electronic album ever, and one of the best albums, period. It even won a Grammy. I don't think you really get what Kanye is up against here. Any festival that got Daft Punk would immediately sell out and have people flying in from around the world."
1024,2020-05-03 08:42:11,gck6q1,And talk about raising the bar? Frank Ocean at Panorama blew me the FUCK away and I don't even listen to him. That was something. Pure magic. Props to him. Another act that has a near-mythical reputation on the live circuit.

1040,2020-05-03 13:09:01,gcjcif,I remember this. Conor McGregor saw him in the player tunnels after beating Nate Diaz in a rematch and was like [‚ÄúPablooo!‚Äù](https://youtu.be/C-0aga2dt6U)
1041,2020-05-03 03:48:48,gcjcif,He genuinely looked like he was having a great time lol
1042,2020-05-03 03:45:30,gcj10n,The top half of /mu/core and whatever is at the top of the rym charts are essentially fantanocore.

1049,2020-05-03 15:54:24,gcj10n,"Eh, he gave them a quick review and he only did so bc 1000 Gecs was already blowing up and ppl were telling him to do so."
1050,2020-05-03 03:32:55,gcj10n,I don't feel that way at all. I think the man's just loved it.
1051,2020-05-04 09:09:49,gcj10n,i mean there have been some really great pop records from solo female artists since charli dropped but i‚Äôm not entirely sure they‚Äôre following in her footsteps i think pop music is just generally in a good place at the moment.
1052,2020-05-04 10:29:19,gcj10n,I think it‚Äôs more not necessarily that Fantano is a big fan but more that 100 gets is popular with people who watch Fantano
1053,2020-05-03 16:52:29,gcj10n,They def were not as big and he even recently got to interview Dylan. Also constant twitter tweets at each other.

1062,2020-05-03 23:43:43,gcfdsq,It stands for both dummy
1063,2020-05-02 23:14:17,gcfdsq,"Wrong he literally says ""I wish I would go ahead and *fuck my life* up"". He never says ""for my lady"""
1064,2020-05-02 23:44:47,gcfdsq,"You see, ""FML"" is a common acronym for ""fuck my life."" In case you didnt pick up on it, Kanye says ""For my lady"" in the song, which is what the acronym is ACTUALLY for. Not to be confused with when The Weeknd says ""fuck my life"" in the chorus of the song. That has no correlation."
1065,2020-05-02 23:38:27,gcfdsq,Have you listened to the song? The opening lyrics of the song are literally ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been waiting for a minute for my lady‚Äù
1066,2020-05-02 23:42:43,gcfdsq,"(This is a shitpost, and he does say for my lady)"
1067,2020-05-03 02:10:59,gcfdsq,It actually stands for both. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs just called FML. He wanted it to be interpreted either way
1068,2020-05-02 23:40:45,gcfdsq,"Hmmmmmmm, yes I have. Good point"
1069,2020-05-02 23:53:04,gcfdsq,"Oop, my bad, sorry!"

1150,2020-06-26 14:18:58,hg8djl,Just guessing he used a Roland TR-808 for a lot of the production. Possibly some other analog gear too.
1151,2020-06-26 14:42:55,hg8djl,Apparently he used a 909 a lot on that album weirdly
1152,2020-06-26 14:32:12,hg8djl,LIke other people said a lot of analog gear such as the 808 and 909. I think the drums are probably the most sampled part since they sound so tribal.

1156,2020-06-26 17:12:55,hg8djl,909 and heartbreaks just isn't as catchy of a title
1157,2020-06-26 15:25:00,hg8djl,Hahah thats very funny. I looked the tr 909 up today. Crazy machine
1158,2020-06-27 01:51:49,hg8djl,Really? Didnt knew this but would make sense
1159,2020-06-27 12:12:36,hg8djl," "" yeah we had an 808 a 909 and a Lynn Drum, plus lots of other samples for that album. Yeah a lot of it is KW playing the 909 live, just hitting the buttons.
I remember running the Love Lock Down main pitched kick thru a sony dat machine. Kinda overloading it, liking the way it sounded, and ended up using that one in the final mix.
Lots of drum sounds had ""air"" layered in with them. Different flavors of white/pink/whatever noise. ""

There are a bunch of people who have mentioned it but it seems it's mainly the 808 bass that was actually to do with tr808"

ya definitely a good name. Thank you it seems he did a lot on the album"
1162,2020-06-26 14:27:51,hg8djl,"I'm truthfully not familiar enough with analog gear to say, especially since a lot of synths can be used to make similar sounds. My guess though is that he has an amazing collection of gear at his disposal, even back in 08."
1163,2020-06-26 21:47:08,hg8djl,"I think it was a poor word choice of him to say ""sampled""; I think he means ""recorded"".  It would be nothing for Kanye to get top notch recordings of session musicians playing tribal drums."
1164,2020-06-26 14:33:48,hg8djl,Thats alright I appreciate whatever info I can get. I am continuing to listen to it and I think you are right. It seems that there are a lot of synths that probably come from some type of gear.
1165,2020-06-27 00:50:21,hg8djl,Ahh got it. I forget sometimes it that sample has that larger overarching definition. Thank you for clarifying
1166,2020-06-26 17:31:47,hg89ip,I‚Äôm open minded. Hopefully it‚Äôs different
1167,2020-06-26 18:36:02,hg89ip,If the quality to price ratio is competitive I can't see this doing poorly
1168,2020-06-26 23:12:38,hg89ip,Ye fleeced them on this one. Ten years???

Diet Prada highlights that this deal overshadows Gap‚Äôs prior commitment to and eventual ghosting of their collab with Telfar. Tbf, Yeezy will probably give them a good boost in sales but it‚Äôll need to be competitive if everyone else (cough Zara cough) already effectively copies Yeezy for lower prices and more sales than Gap"

1175,2020-06-30 20:43:59,hg89ip,"I‚Äôm going to pull this one apart a little just for education and conversation purposes:

Champion EU which pioneered the rebirth the brand and is actually a license deal, Champion the actual brand didn‚Äôt do much for the success.  

That said, Champions heritage for quality pieces and reverse weave was the reference for the new brand stance. 

Gap has never been quality based. I‚Äôve never really picked up a Gap vintage piece and felt high quality construction - I think that‚Äôs the big issue."

1182,2020-06-26 16:15:52,hg7rbq,Kanye is gonna fight Elon to be our craziest billionaire.
1183,2020-06-26 13:52:20,hg7rbq,"I really think this is MASSIVE for Gap. They've kind of developed a reputation as a lame white people brand, with declining quality to boot. But...they're affordable. What this does is inject one of the biggest public figures of the Millenial and Gen Z demographic, who already has a massively successful line of clothes and sneakers at premium prices, and makes it accessible to the common consumer. Zara and H&M have been two of the most consistently profitable, growing companies in the fashion world for the past decade, and this will surely put Gap on a similar track."

1185,2020-06-26 15:15:18,hg7rbq,I bought puts today :)
1186,2020-06-26 14:11:29,hg7rbq,Sell as quickly as you can on this bump.
1187,2020-06-27 02:03:08,hg7rbq,"Trends don't last forever. Everybody in vests, etc, was the pinnacle of Gap's stock value in 1999. Been a 15 year slump. A ten year deal is big. Yeezey's are big. Doesn't matter if I don't care about any shoe over $50 or that Kanye sucks. Doesn't matter. His music is for people who want to fit in. Gap serves that need as well. Gap stock might be a great buy around Christmas. It doesn't even have a pe ratio right now. Stock price went back to 1999 levels between 2011, then back to 1999 levels in 2014. It's been back to the slump since then. There are better buys. Maybe Christmas. Everybody in Yeezeys. 

Retail is risky. Gotta pay rent, gotta be cool. But The Gap has been around for decades. If it's still around in December... perhaps it will still be around in ten years.

There are better buys in more solid industries.

Will we replace sweatshops with robots? Will that affect big brands like Nike? Nike has a ten year deal for NBA team jerseys. Is that more valuable than Yeezeys?"
1188,2020-06-26 16:46:48,hg7rbq,Kanye is honestly one of the most influential human on the planet
1189,2020-06-26 15:43:33,hg7rbq,Holy shit 30% surge
1190,2020-06-27 06:17:08,hg7rbq,[deleted]
1191,2020-06-27 14:22:09,hg7rbq,Observe how Yeezy influenced Adidas.
1192,2020-06-26 16:40:45,hg7rbq,"I don't really see this working out. These two puzzles pieces don't fit together in consumer minds - and they have a big marketing challenge as I see it. What's good about cheap Yeezy? Exclusivity is everything here. Are middle aged mom's going to shop at a store that sells Yeezy clothing? Uniqlo does low priced designer collaborations, but Gap doesn't have the same high fashion brand appeal the way Uniqlo does."
1193,2020-06-26 18:28:57,hg7rbq,Hmm

What's the over/under for the Gap surviving until next year?"
1199,2020-06-26 16:39:23,hg7rbq,Does Kanye still have fans? His recent political moves will be problematic. I predict GAP will have to backtrack.
1200,2020-06-26 18:30:03,hg7rbq,Lol about 2 - 4 years too late. Kanye's fuckin stale now.
1201,2020-06-27 00:46:06,hg7rbq,"I bought GPS a week ago after re upping on some work chinos. I was impressed by the website and so I started researching. Read the most recent conference call transcript and decided to take a bite. 

These guys are well positioned. The CEO and the CFO are both women (don‚Äôt underestimate the goodwill this will produce once its common knowledge) and the CEO is brand new with a lot of leash to retool the business.  

Like everyone else they‚Äôre going to push people to online and phase the storefronts out.  Online direct to retailer as opposed to buying from Amazon is gaining traction. 

GAP is way more multicultural than people think Asians love it and a lot of us black folk have been wearing it with and then without irony for years. 

The biggest predictor of future success is past success and Kanye has succeeded in everything he‚Äôs done."
1202,2020-06-27 16:25:37,hg7rbq,"I was in at $8 and sold 80% a while back, isn‚Äôt Gap supposed to be as weak as Macy‚Äôs? Don‚Äôt think one brand will save them."

You need to write some fake crazy shit but reality is stealing all the craziest storylines possible."
1208,2020-06-26 16:23:09,hg7rbq,You're forgetting Trump
1209,2020-06-26 14:01:50,hg7rbq,"Agreed, this will be huge. It solves the 2 biggest problems with Kanye's current line. First the pricing, as the current Yeezy line is very expensive for most people. Second is accessibility. Yeezy Supply is currently online only (for the most part) and is known for its slow shipping times. 

Having it available at all Gap retail stores and at a lower price will be huge, imo."
1210,2020-06-27 03:43:29,hg7rbq,Gap/Old Navy's number one selling point (at least in my eyes):     Stretchy pants
1211,2020-06-27 20:04:49,hg7rbq,Disagree. Kanye is going to trash this already declining company. Kanye is just Trump with different clothes. Willing to sell out everybody to make a quick buck. This ends bad for both of them
1212,2020-06-26 20:03:11,hg7rbq,"I mean he single handedly put Nike into a panic with his Adidas success. They've since recovered, and found a way to compete, but they really can't coast like they used to."
1213,2020-06-26 17:22:27,hg7rbq,Lol you have no idea how much Kanye influences fashion do you?
1214,2020-06-26 14:41:55,hg7rbq,I second!
1215,2020-06-26 16:48:34,hg7rbq,"You don't understand the pull that Kanye has. This will be a massive success. Kanye fans don't care what he puts out, they will buy it... I know, because I do just that and I am a 36 year old man."
1216,2020-06-26 16:51:41,hg7rbq,"I think that is what they are hoping to change.

Adidas was nothing 5 years ago, now it's a hyped up company that streetwear enthusiasts love."
1217,2020-06-26 17:37:15,hg7rbq,"Lol yes because his thing with Trump had such a large impact on existing Yeezy brand prices and demand.

Oh wait, he actually sold 1.3 Billion dollars worth of sneakers last year."
1218,2020-06-26 19:25:26,hg7rbq,"All he did with call out black people being forced into the Democratic party. Imo the Biden comment about ""you ain't black if you vote for Trump"" essentially vindicated Kanye for those comments."
1219,2020-06-26 19:14:53,hg7rbq,You have no idea. His Yeezy shoes literally sell out in seconds.
1220,2020-06-26 18:38:58,hg7rbq,Kanye is the biggest streetwear fashion icon in the entire world right now. I‚Äôm sure you think the Jordan brand is ‚Äústale‚Äù too lol
1221,2020-06-27 18:05:42,hg7rbq,They have old navy and banana republic brands too -- Macy's is also a whole store that sells tons of shit mostly other brands

1223,2020-06-26 18:26:10,hg7rbq,That's assuming trumps truly a billionaire
1224,2020-06-26 21:31:13,hg7rbq,He said billionaire
1225,2020-06-26 14:04:58,hg7rbq,"The only question is whether or not having accessibility to the product, makes it less desirable. 

One of the things that makes YEEZY so popular is its exclusivity.

I wonder if GAP will want to make the YEEZY line a more limited release."
1226,2020-06-26 19:59:07,hg7rbq,"$10 bucks in a month, mark me"

1229,2020-06-26 18:28:34,hg7rbq,Lol
1230,2020-06-26 22:23:00,hg7rbq,tell em
1231,2020-06-26 17:41:31,hg7rbq,okay

1236,2020-06-27 20:22:58,hg7rbq,I like Gaps Athletica more than anything else they sell for sales growth.
1237,2020-06-28 00:12:00,hg7rbq,Love banana republic when I need to pick up a cheap suit. Their stores around me got quite a bit of foot traffic prior to the miasma
1238,2020-06-26 19:23:26,hg7rbq,Even if he wasn't I don't think it'd be hard at this point. He has a cult big enough to make his POTUS. All he has to do honestly is ask them for money
1239,2020-06-26 21:49:54,hg7rbq,The number of times he could front run the market by tweeting trade war could have made him a trillionaire
1240,2020-06-26 14:52:51,hg7rbq,"For now, the idea of exclusivity will be fresh in people's minds. After a few years, that will probably change, but I expect sales to be huge through the first 3 years or so. Still, Kanye can pretty much sell anything, and the Kardashians aren't going anywhere either. They'll help with sales as well. Maybe Kim will end up with a line of her own at Gap. Or North for kids clothes."
1241,2020-06-26 23:30:26,hg7rbq,"100% will make it more popular

White people love wearing shit that black people wear

And yeezy opens up a whole new demographic to gap

Buy gap now"
1242,2020-06-26 17:33:35,hg7rbq,"Gap just ditched their Hill City B-corp brand. They could easily pivot to a for profit brand to replace it and drive attention to their online business. Everyone here seems to be married to the idea that these lines will primarily be sold inside Gap storefronts, but Gap is a lot bigger than just the one brand. They could also push it more at the Banana Republic locations since that's a higher-end brand already. $80 t-shirts would barely look out of place."
1243,2020-06-27 00:45:32,hg7rbq,It was Kanye's plan from the start to make his clothes accessible. This is how he is realizing it.
1244,2020-06-27 11:43:36,hg7rbq,Lmao its almost down to ten already
1245,2020-06-27 04:55:12,hg7rbq,"Don't be so confident.  Kanye is a fashion icon and this is a game changing deal for GAP   They are making a statement that they are no longer a lame white people brand.  They're going big, bold and new.  I personally really like it."
1246,2020-12-04 10:17:57,hg7rbq,It's over 20 dollars now

It‚Äôs speculation of course but I definitely could see that happening. Even if that doesn‚Äôt happen, yeezy apparel always sells out instantly and is sold at a markup on secondary markups. This is huge for gap. This price bump is temporary, but I‚Äôm buying some gap stocks for long term once the price from this bump settles."
1250,2020-06-26 22:24:29,hg7rbq,I don't think anyone expects him to sell $200+ sneakers at the GAP so what's your point? My point was that Kanye is still very much relevant in pop culture.
1251,2020-06-26 21:52:18,hg7rbq,"Even if you look away from the music, Kanye is one of the most influential people in both Hip Hop and fashion. This is huge for GAP."
1252,2020-06-27 00:47:54,hg7rbq,Well his last good album was TLOP and it was released in 2016 so I don't blame you there. His Yeezy line is super successful but the hype was slowing down over the past 1-2 years. This is a good move.
1253,2020-06-27 22:58:35,hg7rbq,Im not saying its a great stock although kanye does have name recognition.  Just saying there are lots of differences from Macy's.
1254,2020-06-26 19:28:56,hg7rbq,I don't doubt that one bit. I wish i could get money just by asking.
1255,2020-06-26 15:25:52,hg7rbq,Id bet it stil lsells out rapidly to be honest. I wonder if it will be like Fear of God working with PacSun creating the Essentials line which is chraper than the regular FoG offerings. This will probably be similar. FoG essentials still sells out instantly.
1256,2020-06-28 00:13:08,hg7rbq,It‚Äôll become FUBU lol
1257,2020-06-28 21:02:41,hg7rbq,Also depends on how nice the collab is. I‚Äôm suspecting the ‚Äúperfect hoodie‚Äù is a part of this.
1258,2020-06-27 00:43:20,hg7rbq,Me tooooo
1259,2020-06-26 22:19:42,hg7rbq,"I started DCA today at $11.95. How much lower you think it will go? I don't think it will go much lower, definitely not peak Covid dip in March. This collab is much different since it's a long-term one but anytime Target did a collab with someone famous, they would sell out online. I can see the same thing happening if they put out some exclusives put out in limited quantities and I can see them starting this pretty quickly.

And of course its speculation but if Kim K or North is seen wearing GAP, the sheep are going to go nuts for GAP.

I don't know the details of the deal but assuming there are stocks involved in the deal, I don't see why the entire clan won't get into shilling the brand."
1260,2020-06-26 23:49:34,hg7rbq,GAP selling adidas clothes? This is starting to sound like a department store. I dont think it will turn out like that
1261,2020-06-26 23:32:33,hg7rbq,My point is that it's not a good match. Or actually it is a good match since GAP is meh and so is Kanye.
1262,2020-12-04 10:23:19,hg7rbq,3 billion dollar valuation in 2020 is not slowing down
1263,2020-06-27 15:53:27,hg7rbq,"Yeah I honestly can‚Äôt see it going much lower. I‚Äôd watch over the weekend and if it dips any over the weekend it‚Äôll probably dip more on Monday and would be a good time to pick it up just in my opinion. I would imagine it‚Äôll be an online and in store retail. 

As for Kim she‚Äôs always very supportive of Kanye and 100% will be wearing yzy gap at least a couple times out in public. 

I also found this which has some good details of the deal. One important thing is that Kanye is the sole owner of the Yeezy brand.

1264,2020-06-27 11:12:02,hg7rbq,Nah dude it‚Äôs not adidas clothes. Yeezy is partnered with adidas pretty much for distribution and media purposes. It seems like it‚Äôs the same way with gap. I think you should look more into the business model adidas has nothing to do with this
1265,2020-06-27 18:26:04,hg7rbq,Oh true I guess ye does have some stand alone clothes on his own line and they are cool and in style. I'm super curious from a consumer stand point to see what the styles look like and if it will fit the bill of GAP at all lol. Some of his designs are way out there and not traditional in any sense of the word
1266,2020-06-26 13:21:03,hg7e4u,It's his Yeezy x Gap collab that's why he's back
1267,2020-06-26 14:01:34,hg7bu6,It seems like this would downgrade the Yeezy brand.
1268,2020-06-26 15:16:20,hg7bu6,"'Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check‚Äîwasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah, I stole‚Äînever got caught'


The irony!"
1269,2020-06-26 13:20:12,hg7bu6,Kanye cant lose. Time to yolo
1270,2020-06-26 16:30:49,hg7bu6,"A lot of GAP hater on this thread. I would agree that their mall stores are becoming increasingly irrelevant, but they also own Athleta, Jack and Jane and Old Navy among other brands not based out of failing malls. And of anyone can raise retail from the dead....its Yeezus."

1284,2020-06-26 14:28:57,hg7bu6,Does anyone really expect Kanye to stick with a 10-year deal? He seems like the kind of guy who tweets about how Pepsi is the best one minute and Coca Cola is the only thing he drinks the next.
1285,2020-06-26 14:02:04,hg7bu6,Appreciate the post. Wouldn't have seen this otherwise.

1293,2020-06-26 14:09:54,hg7bu6,"Yeah but the success with Yeezy is the shoes, not the clothes.  Doesn‚Äôt seem like that great of a deal to me.  ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù brand at the gap?  Adidas sells clothes but he makes the deal with GAP?"
1294,2020-06-26 17:13:13,hg7bu6,"I really like the long term prospects here.  This is a brand changing partnership.  I think buy and hold is the move here or 1/2022 calls.  Gap is already at a discount because of Corona, if this clothing line is successful they got Kanye locked up for 10 years."

1298,2020-06-26 19:37:32,hg7bu6,Calls. His celebrity circle and many more will endorse and supoort and school kids will replicate. And they will check out other stuff from the store if it looks good.  After that GAP will be cool again and ppl my age will talk about how they wore GAP when they were kids and do it for nostalgia even tho they havent worn it after 2013. My friends said they will cop if it looks good. And it's all gonna be under $100. Look at his twitter and the trending.
1299,2020-06-26 20:41:15,hg7bu6,This was big brain move for ye. He collects millions off a desperate dying business that will more than likely be dead in a year. Then he‚Äôll just go back to doing whatever he wants with yeezy

1304,2020-06-26 14:41:35,hg7bu6,Did anyone catch that open options were frozen for GAP for 3 minutes at the open. When it opened I was throwing random sells to figure out why its not trading- then it opened and ofc my cousin  randomly called my cellphone causing my app to freeze and sell at a stupid low price just as I was raising my sell from $1.50 to 2 .FML 12c 7/17. Pissed. It hit 3$ high.

1329,2020-06-26 21:38:32,hg7bu6,Ill never buy my kids GAP again.
1330,2020-06-26 17:53:09,hg7bu6,When I woke up this morning I never would have thought I'd be thanking god for Kanye West before I went back to sleep tonight. My Gap calls printed because of that  jackass.
1331,2020-06-26 16:09:21,hg7bu6,"I really don‚Äôt think Kanye understands the way the hype that drives his own brand works. He keeps talking about how he wants everyone in the world to be able to own a pair of Yeezys and now he‚Äôs partnering with a budget brand for herbs. 

People want what‚Äôs exclusive and hard to get. A lot of his designs are borderline avant-garde and only fly because the hype factor. Nobody is buying his insane backwards rain boots if they‚Äôre sitting on shelves at the fucking Gap."
1332,2020-06-26 14:30:44,hg7bu6,For sure.  Gap is broke AF.  Lots of the celebrity lines do okay at lower dollar big box stores but I'd be very surprised if Yeezy is able to salvage a store that hasn't been relevant in a decade.  He's selling a life style and brand that is antithetical to the Gap and the kind of people who shop there and at the end of the day I feel like the kids would prefer used Supreme shit over the sweet Yeezy hoodie mom picked up on sale from the most boomer store ever.

1339,2020-06-26 15:09:23,hg7bu6,Wasn‚Äôt Kanye‚Äôs goal to have a similar model to TSLA? I thought Yeezy was supposed to be his attack on high priced designer brands.
1340,2020-06-27 00:17:58,hg7bu6,"It sure does but if they paid him enough then it‚Äôs worth it. Shit he‚Äôs already built it up, might as well milk it now and then sell it outright. He‚Äôll be way richer and have to do zero work from then on."

1361,2020-06-26 14:06:02,hg7bu6,Then you don't know too much about fashion in general. Kanye turned Adidas into the brand every artist tries to work with now to put out an exclusive shoe that they will sell out with a price tag higher than most pairs of Jordans. I doubt very seriously you understand what you are talking about.

1369,2020-06-26 18:59:03,hg7bu6,"He‚Äôs selling basics. Tees, hoodies, joggers. And they will buy that shit off of mall shelves just how they do all Yeezys even after they went to extremely exclusive to being what are deemed general releases, ie the malls get them."
1370,2020-06-26 15:11:56,hg7bu6,They started going downhill 15+ years ago. Every GAP I've seen has downsized in a mall or closed their doors
1371,2020-06-26 16:08:43,hg7bu6,My heart aches for gap lol. Them/banana are the only cheaper and affordable tall men's clothing stores that fit me relatively well. Need them to stay alive haha.
1372,2020-06-26 16:37:18,hg7bu6,Maybe. But I think I you're underestimating the yeezy hype. Trust GAP made a smart move
1373,2020-06-26 14:39:04,hg7bu6,Not sure what their total sales overseas are but for some reason GAP is quite popular in Asia at least
1374,2020-06-26 16:37:35,hg7bu6,"I think you underestimate the Yeezy stans, this stuff will definitely sell. I think he‚Äôs trying to emulate what Jerry Lorenzo does with Fear of God x PacSun. I personally won‚Äôt be buying any of this but I am sure many people will especially if it‚Äôs affordable. I don‚Äôt think this will salvage GAP as a whole, however."
1375,2020-06-26 16:48:20,hg7bu6,He‚Äôs been rocking pink gap polos since they thought it would hurt the rap game.
1376,2020-06-26 18:51:01,hg7bu6,"Thinking this over, I got to agree. Even though Gap's stock surged, like, %42 immediately after this was announced, I really think the hype over it is going to seriously wear off by 2021, which is when the line releases. Especially if it doesn't stand out and just looks like regular Gap clothes, and from the [one picture that Ye revealed of it](https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1276462079625445382), I'm not that confident."

1378,2020-06-26 19:56:41,hg7bu6,Gap was pretty huge in the 90s. Brands like Champion (poor kids sweaters) and Ray-Bans ($20 gas station glasses) used to be struggling and now are extremely popular brands and now fucking expensive. You never really know with fashion.
1379,2020-06-26 17:25:55,hg7bu6,"Nah, he's going to turn GAP around. GAP is a super small / irrelevant brand right now, and I bet they are giving Kanye a lot of power. I bet it's a huge success story. (Like Apple's turn-around in the 90's)."
1380,2020-06-26 19:09:28,hg7bu6,Um GAP is up and coming. They're like the Phoenix rising. Just how phanny packs are cool again. GAP is the official clothing brand of MAGA.

1402,2020-06-26 20:15:25,hg7bu6,The store you sell in definitely matters. Off White and Louis Vuitton wouldn‚Äôt be what they are if they sold at JC Penny. You can‚Äôt be a two-tier brand that sells hype-wear and also sells basics at The Gap. You‚Äôre going to lower the profile of the brand if you‚Äôre selling alongside Tony Hawk and Adam Levine.
1403,2020-06-26 17:01:32,hg7bu6,"They're not gonna sell the shit at Gap, they just closed down their overpriced male athletic brand B-corp while keeping the female equivalent.

Even if this line sells out - do you think that's worth a 30% bump?

Nordstrom Rack is offering 40% off everything in their stores (Seriously go if you have one near you)- why the fuck would you go to the Gap?"

I wouldn't say express is a more popular brand, or revered as a higher end brand than GAP but their jeans are at least $80-90+ retail. As are their producer dress slacks, $90+.

I've also got Macy's put spreads for 7/2 that went up a bunch today, thinking maybe I should've cashed out before close but the bid/ask spread was pretty shit until like 3:59 and I didn't react in time.

1496,2020-06-30 20:07:38,hipql9,Woops reddits going to melt you down now.
1497,2020-07-01 03:43:02,hipql9,"Kanye has donated a good bit of money and other things publicly and I imagine he‚Äôs donated a lot behind the scenes as well, but that‚Äôs none of our business to judge another man‚Äôs donations. What matters is he‚Äôs bringing people to God."
1498,2020-07-01 03:46:57,hipql9,"> How can he say he knows Jesus when he is acting nothing like him.

Care to elaborate? Ever since he‚Äôs turned his life to Christ I haven‚Äôt seen him try and act against Jesus‚Äôs teachings any more than all of us do."
1499,2020-06-30 20:28:46,hipql9,"I disagree with this completely. To say this is all about money and nothing to do with helping inspire people to listen to better music to praise God is nonsense. I‚Äôve had trouble finding good praise and worship music because I like a song to sound different than normal ‚Äòchurch‚Äô songs. His album, Jesus is Born, is one of the best worship albums I‚Äôve heard. Plus him and Kim are worth over a billion, why would he lose a portion of his main audience to make songs about God?"
1500,2020-07-01 15:25:46,hipql9,"Absolutely! What exactly is he mimicking Jesus on? What verse are you speaking of comparing to Jesus? I went to churches for 18 years of my life starting when I was first able to speak, and they taught me nothing about Jesus. I went and they made me believe I knew Jesus when in reality I just ‚Äúknew about Jesus‚Äù. We need to actually pick up the true word of God (I recommend KJV) because he tells us ‚Äúthe word is GOD‚Äù so if we‚Äôre praying to him, we really should be hearing from him as well and opening up his word. This is the one way to get to know him. My going to church in a physical building, and listen to a man up on stage. If we do this, we should at least be double checking what they‚Äôre saying and opening up the word. Anyways to continue to elaborate on this.. but if you knew of this person at your job, but didn‚Äôt actually know them, so you didn‚Äôt know what to get them for their birthday, but if you did know them, you‚Äôd already know what type of things they like and their characteristics and things they enjoy. This being said, theres a big difference in ‚Äúknowing someone‚Äùvs ‚Äúknowing of them‚Äù.  Kanye proclaiming that he knows Jesus, throws other Christians off, it‚Äôs deceiving but yeah he knows what he‚Äôs doing"
1501,2020-06-30 21:18:40,hipql9,"Thats fine that you like the music and find it good for what you're looking for, thats dope, I've got no problem with that. But I do think its ridiculous to think this dudr isn't pandering. And to use his billion as an excuse to not get more, assuming he has that much, is crazy. He hasn't lost much of his audience, and has gained one that already lines the pockets of the rich. Hes a damn genius. But that shouldn't take away from your enjoyment of said pandering. Im with you there."
1502,2020-06-30 21:21:56,hipql9,"Just because it pleases people‚Äôs ears does not mean it is of Jesus. Wether it‚Äôs labels as worship music or not. Even secular worship music nowadays has back masking. And ‚Äúchurches‚Äù in general don‚Äôt even preach the real truth of God‚Äôs word. They cherry pick verse. (Ok if you‚Äôre fortunate you may find one of those small familyish small churches of God that actually teach the true word of God) most do not though, so going off of what churches make you think is right, is super dangerous. I listened to my churches for 19 years straight and the last two years while reading on my own with the lord and fellowshipping with brothers and sisters in Christ, I learned way far more than what any church ever told me. Scripture says we are the temple of Christ and we are the body. When two or three are gathered in his name, he is amongst us. We are the true church. Anyways you said it yourself, him and Kim are worth a billion, people who are truly of Jesus are the lowly and the poor. The rich and known and the ones people praise, that is not a characteristic of Jesus by any means. And by reading his word, this is what he showed me, not churches. I can dm any verses you‚Äôre curious about. Not here to argue, just to share the truth on this false prophet."
1503,2020-07-01 15:44:23,hipql9," But how do you know Kanye doesn‚Äôt know God? His relationship is between him and the Lord alone. There is nothing wrong with this song, and it probably will bring more young people to God than a lot of Christian artists can now because of his fame. By your argument we can‚Äôt trust any Christian music to be truly about God because the artist might not really know God, only talk about him. I believe God is capable of taking a man like Kanye was before he turned to Christ and turning him into a true Christian."
1504,2020-07-01 12:20:51,hipql9,"
For his financial state, it costs a lot of money to produce music, especially with his quality of production. Why would he cater to a marginalized group of followers, rather than making a normal album for all of his followers to enjoy. If he released an album such as life of Pablo, which was actually released on an exclusive paid platform for more revenue, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to release this album for monetary value alone. I think you‚Äôre entitled to your opinion on why he made the album. I just think you‚Äôre taking away from the meaning that I get from this album. God works in mysterious ways and if changing a person who has a huge influence in the music industry to create something that brings more people to Christ, than I think it‚Äôs worth it."
1505,2020-07-01 12:40:26,hipql9,"What I meant by normal church songs is the typical Catholic Church songs, in which they refer to the same songs to worship Christ, with very similar melodies. I like to worship Christ in my own way and I like a specific music to listen to. I agree that learning on your own can be an amazing tool to help you become closer to God, but there‚Äôs an importance to find a church that He calls you towards. I believe you might‚Äôve just went to the wrong church, and that is Gods way of telling you that you‚Äôre meant to join a different one. The church helps in a lot of ways once you find the right one. I encourage you to ask the Lord for guidance to find the church you‚Äôre supposed to be apart of!

In that verse I interpret is as, people who value God more than money are poor in our world but rich in his. There are a lot of wealthy people that are Christians, but tend to care about losing that money rather than Gods plan to use that money. In reality God gives us everything we have, whether it‚Äôs a lot or a little, and doesn‚Äôt value us as people on our monetary worth, but in our spiritual worth. I also believe that He uses the richer people, who can afford it, to accomplish tasks that need money. 

Side note: are you calling me a false prophet or the song?"
1506,2020-07-01 16:01:25,hipql9,"Absolutely Jesus can do this, but if you think Kanye is truly born again when he made the beginning of this video have a couple girls twerking lustfully like jezabel? Nope sorry he doesn‚Äôt know jesus and are misleading people completely. Ask Jesus for discernment on this, don‚Äôt argue with me, argue with God on it. His word is true, Jesus tells us to be wise, and it‚Äôs clear Kanye wasn‚Äôt truly born again like Jesus instructs is to be. He wouldn‚Äôt have posted that in a video talking about Jesus. Have a blessed day friend!:)"
1507,2020-07-01 14:07:16,hipql9,Marginalized lmao ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
1508,2020-07-01 14:00:15,hipql9,"I agree with most of this! But what I want to point out first, no!! I absolutely was not calling you a false prophet, I meant Kanye. (I can dm these verses if you‚Äôd like but I just saw this and if I ignore it I‚Äôll forget so if you‚Äôd like the verse I can send them!:) )) but anyways, Kanye is portraying a fake Christian lifestyle. He is saying Jesus here and there but it‚Äôs to throw Christians off. And I have been in churches since I was able to speak. I have went to SO many. From southern baptist, non denominational, community churches, catholic (yikes this was from a dear friend of mine),  and have also been to Pentecostal churches.lastly went to the mega church. They seemed more intriguing so I thought that‚Äôs where I was being led to. It was a younger crowd and the pastors services were actually interesting. This was me in high school trying to live a Christian lifestyle and it taught me nothing on sin. No church ever did. Jesus does not command or ask of us to go to a physical building and listen to one man on stage. I‚Äôve read and can‚Äôt find where he does this so correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. (Actually correct me, as a fellow Christ follower I myself love correction when following a lie bc the lies are of Satan so really correct me here if you‚Äôve read somewhere in the Bible that I haven‚Äôt) ..but like I said we are the true church but I‚Äôm not gunna disagree with you because not attending church and traveling almost every 6 months to a different state, i don‚Äôt have time to test the spirit in multiple churches because I did that before and could never find one. I also never learned from any church, how much I do now, and how much I know Jesus now vs me just ‚Äúknowing about him‚Äù while going to church. 
Christians nowadays, back then, would‚Äôve been seen as the Pharisees. Any time we (the true church... the ones truly being persecuted and hated for telling the truth like Jesus did) any time we tell ‚ÄúChristians‚Äù the truth and true scripture.. who think they‚Äôre living for Jesus when they‚Äôre following a false gospel and a false faith, they get mad at us when we use scripture and say we‚Äôre of the devil! For using context to define scripture, and not just cherry picking verses. I don‚Äôt call myself a Christian anymore because the world views Christians as a fake scam (and honestly they‚Äôre right in some aspects), you can‚Äôt find one church that doesn‚Äôt ask g for money. Nowhere in the NT does it say anything about ten percent giving to a building. Jesus THREW TABLES in a church where he saw they were making money in his fathers house. He walked in a church and FLIPPED the tables. The one time he wyd the angriest in the Bible. It‚Äôs in Matthew, mark, luke, and John. Jesus tells us that the PATH IS NARROW so if the whole path is all going to churches.... his word must not be true ..? If they were the true church but they‚Äôre not. His word IS and ALWAYS will stand true and that being said, the path is narrow. Many will be deceived. He also says many will claim they know him and don‚Äôt truly know him. He TELLS us to BE CAREFUL to not follow a lie and to not follow this world. He always talks about ‚Äúthe mysteries‚Äù in the Bible and no church will tell you what this is. 
Now back to not all churches are bad, no they‚Äôre not. Since I travel and don‚Äôt have time to hop churches and test them. Didn‚Äôt no good before so I won‚Äôt waste my time now. But, they‚Äôre are a few small family churches where everyone knows everyone. And where they don‚Äôt ask for money, AND preach the actual true word of God and peaches on repentance. May actually peaches on ‚Äúonce saved always saved‚Äù (which is what the word says) 
Most churches do not explain all this. If you e found one like this, this is a huge blessing for you, hold onto that church as long as you can. But I listen to pastor Robert breaker and pastor gene Kim. Both pastors with a small church, they post their sermons and bible studies on YouTube. They truly preach the word of God and don‚Äôt ask for donations to the ministry at all or any of that. These two I thankfully have found and if they were in my state I would love to attend!! I have nothing against Christians who don‚Äôt know this truth^ about churches because I was at that point a few years ago. 
And back to Kanye, the lord tells us we can tell people‚Äôs faith by the fruit they produce. Kanye outing girls twerking in the beginning of that video is not him as a new being. It‚Äôs him being Kanye and one trying to make more money but also.. mainly to deceive people. He‚Äôs been in the illuminates puppet group for yeaarrrsssss. But say they can truly be saved, I‚Äôm not gunna tell anyone to not pray for him. If anything pray for Kanye, he knows exactly what he‚Äôs doing. Just because he mentions ‚Äúgod‚Äù does not mean at all that he‚Äôs talking about Jesus being his God. These people say god all the time but they‚Äôre talking about the God of this world which is currently Satan. 
Like I said please follow up on this with any questions, as I know this may seem pretty out there. I research a lot now because of how much churches, school, government, how they all lied to me. Don‚Äôt take everything I say 100% ofc, look into it yourself. That‚Äôs what this worlds problem is, we believe everything we‚Äôre told. Start questioning thing s, (and of God created all this and you‚Äôre trying to find out the truth and discern truth from lies... he‚Äôs gunna lead you there I promise) 
Take care!! may the lord bless you and your loved ones abundantly and lead you to his path of truth and understanding on these topics in Jesus‚Äôs name. Amen!"
1509,2020-07-02 03:48:59,hipql9,"The video is meant to be disturbing and provocative that way it's juxtaposing the lyrical content of the song. Kanye is calling to wash us in the blood of Jesus Christ (specifically the African American community which Kanye feels needs it the most right now). The girls lustfully dancing, the people fighting, the videos of coronavirus patients, and videos of Breonna Taylor & Ahmaud Arbery are all issues in the African American community that Kanye is showing the viewer. All it takes is some critical thinking to understand this."
1510,2020-07-02 12:37:28,hipql9,"We‚Äôll critically thinking does need to happen, but the right way!:) Jesus says ‚Äúhave no fellowship with darkness, but rather reprove it‚Äù.... I didn‚Äôt know what reprove meant so I looked it up, (context is key when reading the Bible).. means to expose. He tells us to have absolutely no fellowship with darkness but to reprove it. All Kanye is doing in that video is showing a bunch of evil and saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs in the blood‚Äù then the last five seconds of the video he says ‚Äúblood of jesus‚Äù .... if he were truly coming to JESUS, he would‚Äôve given more credit and glory to JESUS and not have fellowship with evil by SHOWING THE VIEWERS SIN. 

Side note, scripture instructs females to dress modestly and cover themselves not only because it‚Äôs righteous, but also because if we dress lustfully, we will cause our brethren to sin and lust after us. That‚Äôs called the jezabel spirit.. if Kanye really was ‚Äúborn again‚Äù like Jesus tells us to be, then he wouldn‚Äôt put girls shaking their junk in a video that‚Äôs ‚Äúbringing people to god‚Äù.. he would NOT show lustful sin because he wouldn‚Äôt want his brethren to fall into sin because of HIM. instead, he WANTS more people to sin. It‚Äôs all a plot that‚Äôs been planned out and people who fall for this garbage are the exact ones I‚Äôm talking about when I say they ‚Äúknow of‚Äù Jesus but don‚Äôt truly KNOW him. 
I am extremely passionate when it comes to exposing this trash because it has Christians THINK they know their king when they truly don‚Äôt. He‚Äôs our father and people don‚Äôt even want to pick up HIS WORD to GET TO KNOW HIM. Tbh if this doesn‚Äôt make sense to anyone reading this, you haven‚Äôt used scripture to define scripture and you probably listen to everything you‚Äôre told and believe everything on the news. 
Ask Jesus to show you the truth on this video about Kanye, and he will. Get over the pride of ‚Äúbeing right‚Äù and just ask him. Argue wit him on this, not me. His word is true and Kanye is NOT following Jesus, he‚Äôs following the devil WILLINGLY knowing it. He KNOWS he‚Äôs deceiving his fans and he does not care one bit. If anything it seems like people are trying to defend Kanye before defending Jesus and that‚Äôs TRULY so sickening."
1511,2020-07-03 01:02:03,hipql9,"You don't get it do you... Kanye is not PROMOTING sin he's showing it to make his points clear. Ephesians 5:11 which you referenced is not telling Christians to not show people the difference between right and wrong because that means describing sin, it means that we shouldn't be partaking in sin. Is Kanye the one doing the sin portrayed in the video? No. Is Kanye the one praying for God to save these people in the song? YES. Kanye is illustrating sin in the visual to put context to his song."
1512,2020-07-03 12:37:18,hipql9,"‚ÄúHave no fellowship with darkness‚Äù is what I said, what scripture says. NO FELLOWSHIP .. no he wasn‚Äôt the one partaking in the beginning of the video, but he put it in his video for viewers to see! And that‚Äôs wrong! It wrong because that can make him countable for having his brethren fall victim of lustful sin. Jesus doesn‚Äôt like when we cause others to sin buddy :) I‚Äôm not gunna argue with you for two reasons.....1 because i can tell you‚Äôre getting irritated in this conversation and I‚Äôm not arguing with you because JESUS doesn‚Äôt want us to. If it‚Äôs about his word and the other person isn‚Äôt hearing or comprehending, he tells us to wash off the dust of our feet and move on. Only important tho g is that you believe in Jesus as your savior. what‚Äôs not important AT ALL is debating on wether or not this video from Kanye is right. We‚Äôre suppose to expose darkness, not sit here and argue about who‚Äôs right or wrong. You don‚Äôt hear me on this and that‚Äôs your loss truly. 

Second reason I‚Äôm not continuing in your little debate ... I‚Äôve done my part in speaking on how he‚Äôs a false prophet. He is one. :)  Don‚Äôt like it? Argue with God on it, not me. Argue with what his word says because it‚Äôs all 100% truth. He also instructs us to not throw pearls at swine so  because of that, I‚Äôm not commenting on this anymore ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èhave a blessed day in Jesus‚Äôs name! :)"

Has he gotten his boy Trump to help Chicago?! Or did he just thank him for the tax breaks and let Kim sit in his lap.

Mofo donated a milli (another tax break) and puts out this ignorant self absorbed song about how we are drug dealers and thugs and it's all cause of slavery and genocide. Fight slavery and genocide not the current administration that allowed him to file as non-profit.

At least Travis was talking about something actionable.

edit: on my third listen. i like the subject matter, i like that he's addressing the shit the black community's going through right now, but it feels a bit...weird that he's also addressing criticism thrown at him for supporting trump in the same song. at least, i think that's what those 'trying to control ye' bits are about. haven't looked at the lyrics yet."
1608,2020-06-30 14:48:40,hinzq9,"muuuuuuch much better than anything kanye has released post-TLOP. if it's a part of a bigger project and if it's the direction that he's headed in then i guess i'm interested. 

also, the production + the mv gives me yeezus vibes!"
1609,2020-06-30 15:11:04,hinzq9,This is my favourite Kanye release in a while even if the lyrics get hilariously bad at points lmao (though that makes the New Slaves comparisons more apparent)

Ok, so I'm not even against Travis in general. I have enjoyed a few of his songs in the past. 

But I have to say, he almost NEVER adds anything to a track. 

I find it WILD how women in pop/rap are expected to reinvent themselves with every new era in order to stay relevant, but for some reason guys like Travis can do his exactly ONE NOTE shtick since the beginning of his career and people eat. it. up.

He has 0 versatility, period. He can only do one act. 

Slightly changing one or two things and then saying that he's versatile because of that is exactly what I'm talking about.

But I understand that people will bend over backwards for him for some reason, so I knew that this would get downvoted."

1651,2020-07-01 01:03:25,hinzq9,I‚Äôm not a Kanye fan so I can‚Äôt comment on the quality of his music but this is a sentiment I see very often for many artists. It might be hard to admit but do you think it‚Äôs nostalgia that‚Äôs making it hard to appreciate more recent music? Or is the newer music just genuinely not as good as it used to be? I think people tend to forget about nostalgia and the power it has to impact our judgements.
1652,2020-07-01 02:23:23,hinzq9,Kids See Ghosts was pretty good though.
1653,2020-06-30 15:06:03,hinzq9,Is that the director of this video?
1654,2020-06-30 14:45:06,hinzq9,"Drums sound heavier to me on streaming (same headphones), but I might be an idiot"
1655,2020-06-30 17:01:50,hinzq9,This is true for his recent output but you really need to listen to Rodeo. It‚Äôs like 10 different ‚Äúacts‚Äù just on that album.
1656,2020-06-30 23:44:00,hinzq9,I mean he also mentions fake news so it wouldn't surprise me if he's talking about backlash from him supporting Trump.
1657,2020-06-30 16:17:00,hinzq9,agreed but for some reason i associate it more with cudi than kanye tbh
1658,2020-07-01 15:33:25,hinzq9,One of my favorite albums of all time
1659,2020-07-04 11:36:27,hinzq9,Also one of the few I would give a 10/10 as well.
1660,2020-07-01 13:46:08,hinzq9,What do you like about the song?

I‚Äôd like to hear from non-hypocrites."

1664,2020-06-30 14:38:35,hinzq9,KSG is garbage
1665,2020-06-30 14:22:06,hinzq9,"Yeah one thing that makes me look up is that JIK was just rushed as a gospel project on a whim while this new album actually started with the intention of being whatever it is, so he might emerge victorious this time around"
1666,2020-07-01 03:55:47,hinzq9,"Nah his newer music has definitely been subpar when compared to his previous efforts. I've been a big kanye fan for a while now, and to me the defining moment his music started going downhill was with his album Jesus is King. He wanted to make a rap gospel album, which is fine, but it just was terrible, only listened to it once, and this was coming on the heels of kids see ghost which is an amazing album, although pretty short. So it's not like he's been declining for a long time but his latest stuff hasn't been amazing, or the quality that is expected of him."
1667,2020-06-30 15:07:22,hinzq9,Yep. All of his work this same culture montage schtick
1668,2020-06-30 16:25:20,hinzq9,Ye's vocals on the video are trash. That's the main difference I think
1669,2020-06-30 17:09:51,hinzq9,"Yeah, Travis has been phoning in lately but I think he comes in with a different style each album. It‚Äôs just that this Astroworld era has lasted for like 2 years at this point, he will probably switch it up for his next big release. Rodeo and Days Before Rodeo (and evening some of Birds imo) were completely different than anything he‚Äôs made recently."
1670,2020-06-30 17:03:08,hinzq9,"> you really need to listen to Rodeo

I have heard that album 100 times (it was everywhere and literally impossible to miss), I've heard the mixtapes leading up to the album, I've heard the albums after that album, the singles in between, the leaks...everything. 

I stand behind what I said."
1671,2020-06-30 18:44:03,hinzq9,I can't think of a more overrated album than Rodeo. Is it bad? not at all. is it good? not at all.
1672,2020-07-01 12:15:42,hinzq9,"No. He‚Äôs talking about the tmz interview where the news outlets(with largely white liberal journalists) edited and cut the interviews to make it sound like he was making fun of the slaves in the past 400 years. But when you look at the whole interview, he talks about how we‚Äôre enslaved even now because every politician just looks at people of color as a number, and every big corporation will have products based on black culture but will not let some black people into their stores, or if they‚Äôre rich black people how they‚Äôll explicitly ask them to come in. It‚Äôs maddening how much backlash he gets from that interview when it was a very good interview, and white people with blue checks who did hate him from a long time got their ammunition to turn black people against him."
1673,2020-06-30 16:22:49,hinzq9,Probably because most of the high moments from KSG come from Cudi tbh
1674,2020-07-01 13:51:28,hinzq9,"I like the beat, especially when it drops near Travis‚Äôs part. Kanye‚Äôs vocals could‚Äôve been much better and think Travis or Kanye should have had an extra line but compared to JIK I think this was very good step in the right direction. I like Yeezus a lot and this song gave me a similar vibe"

Does him participating in a BLM protest and donating >$2 million not say enough for you?"
1677,2020-06-30 15:02:07,hinzq9,"Lol what? Ye was overhated because of the stuff he said before it‚Äôs release, and a lot of people have said it‚Äôs alright. Tlop is for many people top 4-5 Kanye. KSG top ranks high for many people, Daytona also had insane production. Jesus is king is the anomaly."
1678,2020-06-30 15:25:31,hinzq9,"I just disagree. Ye is good, TLOP is good and KSG is great. His production overall also has not lost a step. JIK is his only blunder imo. But I do think his next album will follow the same faith. As long as he's going to be doing this Jesus thing my expectations will stay low."
1679,2020-06-30 14:56:47,hinzq9,Hot take.
1680,2020-06-30 15:12:54,hinzq9,"I like it. It‚Äôs a bit abstract but there‚Äôs a lot of nice moments in the video that have some interesting interplay between the haphazard videos and the brooding 3D tendered stuff. The effect on Kanye‚Äôs face combined with the way the screen is split works really well too.

That said I‚Äôm a hack who went to art school as well so take what I say with a grain of salt haha."
1681,2020-06-30 19:52:27,hinzq9,Yeah the difference in the vocals is crazy. The YouTube version sounds like ass
1682,2020-07-02 15:58:07,hinzq9,That vocal style is actually a style. just because its not clear doesnt make it trash.
1683,2020-06-30 17:21:15,hinzq9,"> Rodeo and Days Before Rodeo (and evening some of Birds imo) were completely different than anything he‚Äôs made recently.

""completely different"""
1684,2020-06-30 17:11:16,hinzq9,"But like, your objectively wrong if you can‚Äôt see the difference between a song like Antidote and a song like Impossible. It‚Äôs not the same shtick"
1685,2020-06-30 18:30:33,hinzq9,"How? The best part of the album is the production and verses and Kanye undoubtedly had the better verses, he had the better verse in fire, fourth dimension, Kids see ghosts, and Cudi Montage. Reborn is a Cudi classic tho I won‚Äôt lie and feel the love, they both don‚Äôt have any verses at all. Freeee I think ty dolla shines more than both of them."
1686,2020-06-30 17:39:25,hinzq9,almost every kanye verse on ksg is peak

1688,2020-06-30 15:12:34,hinzq9,"Ye isn‚Äôt his best work but it still contained a couple all time great Kanye songs (Ghost Town is easily a top 10 Kanye track). And on relisten, the album as a whole is a solid 7.5 out of 10. Low for Kanye standards but still pretty good"
1689,2020-06-30 15:19:30,hinzq9,"It's like a 6-7 for me but it being overhated bc of Kanye's antics isn't an accurate assessment,it's just atypically low on innovation for a kanye album"
1690,2020-06-30 15:38:10,hinzq9,"Why do you act surprised? It's a pretty common opinion that Kanye's been trending downwards since ~2016. TLOP was good, but isn't a universally loved album, and many see it as a step down from previous Ye albums. Ye was even more divisive. JIK is pretty much seen by everyone as a flop. IMO, TLOP is a 7.5, Ye a 5, and JIK a 3."
1691,2020-06-30 23:58:51,hinzq9,Imo TLOP and KSG are fantastic and ye is decent
1692,2020-07-01 03:15:49,hinzq9,"I kind of think it's important to remember that the Yandhi Leaks were phenomenal.

So it's even less about him falling off production wise (not that you claimed that he did) -- and rather it's a choice to release these things that sound unfinshed (probably to stir controversy, who knows?)

Do you and I understand?
Not really, but Ye is Ye."
1693,2020-07-01 12:11:00,hinzq9,Because the YouTube version also has audio from the video clips playing too.
1694,2020-06-30 17:34:15,hinzq9,"Yeah, I would say so. Listen to something like Drugs You Should Try It or Don‚Äôt Play off Days Before Rodeo where everything is much grittier, crazy heavy on reverb through the entire track. Or 90210, and Apple Pie, which are both much more ethereal than anything on Astroworld. Or even on Owl Pharoah where everything is a bit more dissonant and it‚Äôs a bit more traditional trap, barely any aesthetic autotune. He plays a bit with his auto tune on Rodeo where on Astroworld there‚Äôs a bit less of that and it‚Äôs a bit more one-note delivery. 

I guess if autotuned trap isn‚Äôt your thing that‚Äôs totally fine but I think he‚Äôs switched it up quite a bit in the past on older songs."
1695,2020-06-30 19:24:30,hinzq9,you guys need to handle dissenting opinions better. it's embarrassing.
1696,2020-06-30 17:13:06,hinzq9,"I mean I don't think I will really take objectivity advice about Travis Scott from someone whose username is literally a Travis Scott reference, but thanks!"
1697,2020-06-30 15:15:29,hinzq9,"Exactly. It‚Äôs at worst a 7. JIK was a mess, but seeing ksg, tlop, the production on Daytona, yandhi, how could anyone think he‚Äôs losing it?"
1698,2020-06-30 15:40:59,hinzq9,"It is a universally loved album. The only people who don‚Äôt like it are salty ass dudes who hate Kanye irrationally. You can have a vote now and people will put tlop in their top 5 kanye albums. TLOP is easily an 8, ye a 7, and JIK a 2. This song is one of the best to drop this year."
1699,2020-07-01 12:14:48,hinzq9,"I've honestly still not heard the Yandhi leaks. I wanted to wait for the release, and after it was scrapped I couldn't find a good place to download/stream them."
1700,2020-06-30 17:44:07,hinzq9,"> I guess if autotuned trap isn‚Äôt your thing that‚Äôs totally fine but I think he‚Äôs switched it up quite a bit in the past on older songs.

It IS my thing. 

Mind you I have listened to every official Travis Scott project and many many of the leaks. 

To me, it takes a little more than just slightly changing autotune and reverb levels to show versatility. 

The only thing that I've seen recently that even slightly impresses me with Travis is that he was speaking Spanish in the Rosal√≠a song. Even then he has sprinkled a few words in his songs in Spanish anyway."
1701,2020-06-30 17:17:20,hinzq9,"You‚Äôre too incorrect to get out of this, Matty. Just say you were being hyperbolic"
1702,2020-06-30 15:50:41,hinzq9,"Calling people salty ass irrational dudes because they don't love an album is *exactly* why Kanye stans have a reputation for being really cringey. Even a lot of Kanye fans (not the obsessive kind) think that the album is a bit bloated and not one of his strongest lyrically. It's not a consensus top 5 Ye album. He has a remarkably strong discography, and TLOP falls a bit short from the mark in terms of the high quality you'd expect from a Ye album up to that point. I like TLOP, but it's not without it's faults."
1703,2020-06-30 23:27:13,hinzq9,it is not a universally loved album. people will put it in their top 5 ofc because kanyes discography is so diverse that some sounds just wont appeal to certain listeners.
1704,2020-07-03 07:29:44,hinzq9,"Most of them are even uploaded on YouTube now without any hiding, a lot of full album compilations used to be called 'N O T yandhi' etc but i don't think they care anymore about removing them

Here's a couple of great ones:

[Law of Attraction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4SSF1rxy9A), [Alien](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6RNrfn6Ois), [City in the Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3GEJdjub_M), [All Dreams Real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcRAUkGRf68), [Hurricane/80 Degrees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIJdMDOsJCk), [Slave Name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9e60ef6qA), [Spread Your Wings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdWIQ6z1gdg), and of course, [New Body](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFGflR2hAqQ)

Now keep in mind, a lot of it contains mumbling as they were leaked in unfinished states, but given what's there, had he finished the verses, it's safe to say it could have been on par with his other classic albums (don't want to get ahead of myself and say MBDTF-level but the production and melodies presented here are very very good).

There is a rumor around however that says Kanye's team actually did hand in an 8-track Yandhi album on September 29, 2018 (the original release date announced via tweet) to Def Jam, but at the last minute something happened and it didn't drop. So instead we're left to piece together all the leaks like a puzzle."
1705,2020-06-30 18:04:35,hinzq9,"I feel you, to me the ambience is completely different so it feels totally different to me. But yeah, his delivery on TKN is pretty unique to his whole discography."
1706,2020-06-30 17:18:43,hinzq9,"I've been around since the beginning of his career. 

One. Note.

I'm not saying I didn't enjoy that note from time to time."
1707,2020-06-30 16:03:06,hinzq9,"It has faults which is why it‚Äôs an 8 though. For me I have tlop at 6 because mbdtf, tcd and ksg are my top 3, then yeezus, late registration and tlop at 6. But you‚Äôre living in a bubble if you think a majority of Kanye fans don‚Äôt think tlop is at least an 8. You‚Äôre calling people cringey because you‚Äôre being called out for being a hating ass mf. You said kanye was falling off lmao, that alone proves you‚Äôre hating on him. There‚Äôs literally zero indication of that considering how much good music he‚Äôs put out in the past three years. 

Watch, All of Daytona, ghost town, violent crimes, all of ksg, ktse, and this one. And even jik had selah and follow god which were very strong tracks. While jik overall was garbage, to say ksg is an anomaly but he‚Äôs fell off is a stupid hating ass statement"

This 4-8 line feature with retired flows, I still Stan but he is the goat. I want ‚Äúdark knight Dummo‚Äù vibes when Travis drops in. Maybe this song just wasn‚Äôt for him and it‚Äôs a shame. I want him to snap again like days before rodeo and so many other tracks he has produced and preformed.

With all that being said if THE SCOTTS comes out the way I think they might I might be eating my own words. Just wondering if anyone else has been kinda feeling meh about some of his verses.

he did ad-lib holy spirit come down tho which is pretty funny 

great song and pretty good feature from travis"
1762,2020-06-30 16:56:52,hinwzn,"Travis believes in God, and was most likely born into a Christian family, if you watch the LICF doc, you can see him praying with his squad before hitting the stage.

He even made a song about his dislike of people claiming they're god's, or tryna become god's, both as a way to encourage not tryna be perfect or placing yourself above others, and not pretending you're some infallible deity.

My favorite line in that song is, ""but air traffic controls the landing"", which is a metaphor for appreciating those ""below"" you, or the ones you don't think about that help you. We need people more than we realize, even when we're successful. No working class equals no concerts, merch, safety, promotion, travel, etc."
1763,2020-06-30 19:20:44,hinwzn,"Well i mean Travis was just speaking spanish on Rosalia's new song TKN, im pretty sure the man is open to anything now lmao"

1819,2020-07-01 20:34:54,hinwzn,"He said it in tweets during the time he thought whines and complained about people  being that he was supporting trump and all He could come up with was ‚Äúlet me be me‚Äù which was never on trial, but his decision to support such a horrible person was."
1820,2020-07-01 20:31:49,hinwzn,Oh look another person who has no idea what Obama did for Chicago. We do have internet people ...maybe use it if you were too busy or uninterested to pay attention the first time around.
1821,2020-06-30 14:15:22,hinwxk," This better than anything off of *Jesus is King.* The beat is amazing, reminds me of *Yeezus*, and Travis works really well

Kanye has solid bars here too."
1822,2020-06-30 14:07:06,hinwxk,"So...he's back to making secular music then?

Also, why the fuck couldn't he have made something this good on *Jesus is King*? 

I mean, its not his best track or anything, but its still pretty good."
1823,2020-06-30 15:10:31,hinwxk,It‚Äôs good! Not his best ever but it‚Äôs a big step in the right direction. Hopefully his new album continues that trend
1824,2020-06-30 16:27:43,hinwxk,This is the most happy I've ever seen this sub for Ye lmao
1825,2020-06-30 14:31:54,hinwxk,Yeezus meets Jeezus
1826,2020-06-30 20:21:13,hinwxk,How predictable that he‚Äôs releasing a new album this year called ‚ÄòGod‚Äôs Country‚Äô to get that MAGA coin before Trump is booted out of office in January. Actually quite a smart move on Kanye‚Äôs part.
1827,2020-06-30 14:08:07,hinwxk,Better than anything on JIK but still its nothing great
1828,2020-06-30 21:06:54,hinwxk,"Giving me ""The Light Is Coming"" vibes with that screaming dude in the background"
1829,2020-07-03 07:33:33,hinwxk,"Chaotic video with the blatant political message in the song reminds me of This is America.

Already harder than everything on Jesus is King and hopefully we're on track for a good project this time around. For a perfectionist like Kanye it's frustrating he'd ever think of putting out a project like JIK, but I think he realizes that it's a stain on his discography and that's probably why he's getting Dre's help to redo it"
1830,2020-06-30 15:04:26,hinwxk,Was it the title about being washed in the blood of the lamb or the Holy Spirit come down that made this secular?
1831,2020-06-30 16:27:18,hinwxk,"Not exactly secular, the content is pretty clearly Christianity and there are no curse words, not even from Travis"
1832,2020-06-30 14:23:37,hinwxk,"The new album is apparently going to be called God's Country so it's not going to be completely secular, plus Kanye's always had religious references in his music.

But yeah hopefully it won't be full on religious like Jesus is King. I hope that was just a last minute decision based on how rushed everything sounds on JIK, and not something we can expect from every Kanye album from now on"
1833,2020-06-30 19:59:15,hinwxk,"This doesn¬¥t sound secular, its not in the Gospel genre for sure."
1834,2020-06-30 15:38:37,hinwxk,I Am A God ft. GOD teas!
1835,2020-06-30 21:38:32,hinwxk,"Idk how true it is but according to GLC, Kanye gave him a box of MAGA hats to get rid of and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm never wearing these again‚Äù and only did it to get close to Trump so they could get the resources to help inmates like Cyntoia Brown. 

Again idk how true that is but that‚Äôs according to GLC (who‚Äôs signed to GOOD Music). 

But you might be right, with that info not being well known he could still be taking advantage of the conservative crowd he attracted."
1836,2020-06-30 14:09:29,hinwxk,100% this. Last verse is good.

1839,2020-06-30 17:23:02,hinwxk,"> God's Country

I think some people use that as a nickname for Wyoming, so that could be what it's referencing."
1840,2020-06-30 22:23:07,hinwxk,"Well then, yeah, if that is indeed true, then this is a very shrewd move on his part. Get that MAGA coin and bounce."
1841,2020-07-03 07:45:47,hinwxk,"Tbf tho, Budden is a complete hater when it comes to Kanye (just look at [this clip from the Joe Budden podcast yesterday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixOqb8E5njE)), and he mentioned the great comment was from a friend of his whose musical opinion he values greatly, so while Budden himself probably will never admit Kanye is dropping some hot shit, the fact others are saying it is makes me have really high hopes for the Dremix. And if GC is going to sound like WUITB then Kanye fans are def gonna be eating this year"
1842,2020-06-30 14:04:59,hinwks,Kanye coming with the GTA clips
1843,2020-06-30 14:08:26,hinwks,Kanye went TLOP towards the end there with those Kanye bars
1844,2020-06-30 14:08:39,hinwks,This sounds like JIK x Yeezus and I'm here for it!!!
1845,2020-06-30 14:09:20,hinwks,Yeezus 2 is on the way boys
1846,2020-06-30 14:04:05,hinwks,Lmao what the hell is this video
1847,2020-06-30 14:11:02,hinwks,The clip at 1:10 is from Kendrick's ELEMENT music video
1848,2020-06-30 14:05:06,hinwks,This fucking slaps
1849,2020-06-30 14:08:00,hinwks,The video left me speechless. It felt like a document of the times we live in. What a historic moment. Yeezy's done it again.
1850,2020-06-30 14:05:05,hinwks,Song is insane

1854,2020-06-30 14:36:35,hinwks,Sounds like Yeezus is King.
1855,2020-06-30 14:38:28,hinwks,mixing is way better than in the youtube video
1856,2020-06-30 15:46:42,hinwks,"This is what JIK should‚Äôve sounded like. I‚Äôm still mad about not getting Yandhi, but this definitely makes up for it lmao"
1857,2020-06-30 14:06:47,hinwks,"The fuck is up with his vocals on this? Sounds like he recorded it in a bathroom at 3 AM

Did he wash it out on purpose?"
1858,2020-06-30 15:49:35,hinwks,Damn I‚Äôm excited for God‚Äôs Country
1859,2020-06-30 14:07:28,hinwks,Does anyone feel like the mixing is shit here? Like the song's great but it just sounds muffled as fuck

1866,2020-06-30 14:22:59,hinwks,Honestly better than everthing on JIK besides follow god
1867,2020-06-30 14:20:28,hinwks,It's good
1868,2020-06-30 14:55:06,hinwks,This is some intense tribal yeezus music and i am so here for it.  Love this.
1869,2020-06-30 15:47:52,hinwks,Damn fire
1870,2020-06-30 14:16:06,hinwks,yo can we get the instrumental plz

1872,2020-06-30 14:39:05,hinwks,"Better than anything on JiK, shout out to kanye for just releasing these tracks with the weird scratch track vocals still there and not just leaving them in the laundry."

1874,2020-06-30 15:54:49,hinwks,"This will get me downvoted but I do not have faith that Kanye will put out great music anymore. Nothing has sounded remotely good to me since 2018. The weird thing is we know he can still produce well when I hear KSG or Daytona but it's like he lacks vision or something with his own projects. The mixing is poor on this and JIK, the production is not special at all, and his lyrics are lazy, even for himself. If a rising artist dropped any of the music he has in the last year, no one would talk about it. I don't know with Kanye anymore."
1875,2020-06-30 14:09:11,hinwks,Random But Dope Video.

1878,2020-06-30 15:35:23,hinwks,Why does it sound better on Spotify
1879,2020-06-30 15:36:40,hinwks,Imma have to let this song marinate for a bit until I form an opinion about it. I don‚Äôt know if I really like it because I had such low expectations after JIK or if it‚Äôs truly a banger lol
1880,2020-06-30 22:10:48,hinwks,HES BACKKKKKKKKKKKKK
1881,2020-07-01 00:31:29,hinwks,"Can't say I'm a fan the way the percussion sounds in this, production sounds a little too trendy for my tastes. Kanye's always been a guy who sets trends, not follows them, so I'm just not loving this song."
1882,2020-07-01 01:31:55,hinwks,TIDAL WTF IS GOING ON? EXPLAIN YOURSELF JAY...
1883,2020-06-30 14:53:54,hinwks,I feel like this is going to sound better on the album
1884,2020-06-30 16:53:33,hinwks,I don‚Äôt dislike Kanye but I do dislike this song.
1885,2020-06-30 16:50:52,hinwks,Just like JiK this song would improve dramatically if kanye wasn't playing christian madlibs when writing. Disappointing he's still on this wave.
1886,2020-06-30 15:25:50,hinwks,This is so much better than all of JIK. Damn.
1887,2020-06-30 16:09:22,hinwks,anybody know the name of those brown glasses he was using on the video?

1913,2020-06-30 14:35:18,hinwks,"My favourite way of interpreting it. It felt hard to start with the protests and the woman on a ventilator but where it goes from there is mental. Think its like trying to coalesce all of the different experiences of blackness into a single visual.

The graphics on his face are stumping me. Think there may be something go play with along the lines of obscurity of celebrity and how people are almost untouched at that level (thinking of shots of him alone, parting the crowds, on the rafters at Pablo).

The sea of chains visual is mental."

1922,2020-06-30 14:50:20,hinwks,So fucking lazy with the production
1923,2020-06-30 14:08:11,hinwks,Yep. Like Travis just sounds so much clearer than Kanye

1925,2020-06-30 15:05:50,hinwks,i listened on apple music and the single version is way better mixed. opened the video now on youtube and it sounds like shit.

1935,2020-07-01 02:05:53,hinwks,It's because his main focus is no longer on music.
1936,2020-06-30 16:00:26,hinwks,Still makes great music (see: Yandhi) but what he puts out is his vision. He wants to put out more artistic stuff rather than put out bangers I think
1937,2020-06-30 20:13:06,hinwks,Lol just say you didn't like JIK... that's the only music he's made since KSG.

1971,2020-06-30 14:12:14,hinwks,Probably because Kanye‚Äôs recording on his fucking iPhone and Travis is in an actual studio
1972,2020-06-30 17:38:48,hinwks,I think that's intentional. Travis coming in like an angel in the chaos
1973,2020-06-30 14:34:53,hinwks,Right? Like you don‚Äôt just forget what you learned abt recording
1974,2020-06-30 16:47:32,hinwks,"Idk if it was the video or Spotify, but before his second verse I think, his voice clears up immensely"
1975,2020-06-30 17:24:37,hinwks,I feel like Kanye‚Äôs vocals fit really well for this type of track but it sounded off when juxtaposed next to Travis‚Äô vocals which were much clearer.
1976,2020-06-30 15:41:02,hinwks,"Spotify also sounds way better, looks like the music video version is just mixed horribly."
1977,2020-06-30 14:07:25,hinwks,Your kids are gonna love it
1978,2020-06-30 14:20:34,hinwks,He records on his iPhone then straight too his laptop to insert it üòÇ
1979,2020-06-30 16:07:41,hinwks,"I have Yandhi downloaded on my phone for a few tracks, but those songs were made in 2018, right? Even the songs I do like on there, he just mumbles all over and shows little effort lyrically/vocally, which I would have argued is just because they are unfinished, but JIK and this song show us that that is the new norm imo. Ye has always wanted to put out artistic stuff, he constantly calls himself a creative genius and whatnot, which this sub doesn't even question clearly."
1980,2020-06-30 20:57:16,hinwks,"Yeah I guess Ye came out before KSG. I didn't like Ye either. Two subpar albums and not much was unique on Yandhi either (even if they were leaks), and then a directionless mess is supposed to get me excited for God's Country? My point was that I am done expecting him to drop music that's well-made by even his own standards. Good for him I guess, he has way better ways to make money these days than his music."
1981,2020-06-30 22:46:28,hinwks,"Yeah, [like trying to defend yourself](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/bp9bda/we_need_change_people) or [thanking them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhNEdBxUlwc)."

1992,2020-06-30 14:25:58,hinwks,[deleted]
1993,2020-06-30 16:13:22,hinwks,"Lol. TLOP was the last Kanye solo album he finished mixing and there's still some pretty bad blemishes (and he was still replacing files almost a yr out from release).. since then he really just keeps rushing tf out of the projects and every factor is suffering from lyrics to beats to the final polish. That's just the way it is.

Also Chanel is an incredible song I have no idea where it belongs in the convo"
1994,2020-06-30 16:52:28,hinwks,Ye did Chanel?!?!
1995,2020-06-30 16:17:58,hinwks,Ya but you don't need expensive equipment to make it sound way *better* than what he's been putting out. I could mix JIK and make it sound 2x better. It's the TIME that he's simply not putting in and that's the most unfortunate because he can *afford* all the time he needs. I also want to be very clear: I love raw shit. From Tommy Wright III to Death Grips but what Kanye does nowadays; *ain't it*
1996,2020-06-30 14:14:04,hinwks,"Then maybe he shouldn‚Äôt be recording on an iPhone for an actual song/album?

If he sounds like that through all of God‚Äôs Country it‚Äôs gonna annoy the shit out of me"
1997,2020-06-30 21:34:50,hinwks,honestly I think if you recorded vocals on an iPhone and put them through antares they wouldn't sound that far off still. there's so much processing going on that the original source definitely matters but not nearly as much as in just a clean vocal
1998,2020-06-30 15:54:42,hinwks,"Or you get super lazy and don‚Äôt want to go to a studio to record so you go into a quiet room with your iphone and hope it‚Äôs good enough.

Song is fire but he should record his verse at a studio. Doesn‚Äôt sound great. Sounds muddy and lazy rather than what he wants us to hear. Unless, he wants us to hear muddy and laziness lol"
1999,2020-06-30 16:48:43,hinwks,"I've noticed something weird were his voice is abnormally clear one time when he said ""Southside, what it does"""
2000,2020-06-30 21:37:10,hinwks,video version has weird stereo effects that disappear at that point.
2001,2020-06-30 14:51:42,hinwks,Reference so fire we forgive the typo
2002,2020-06-30 14:24:42,hinwks,Dr Dre watching Kanye upload his iPhone verse into ProTools üëÅüëÑüëÅ
2003,2020-06-30 14:51:13,hinwks,Yesterday I was telling my friend that the leak was definitely not close to finished and he‚Äôll surely fill it with more thought out lyrics by release. And I was mostly wrong ha
2004,2020-07-01 05:35:51,hinwks,GTA police also shoot you till you die. They never try to arrest you
2005,2020-07-01 01:36:12,hinwks,peep his username bruh don't take the bait
2006,2020-07-01 06:28:34,hinwks,"Well, if my partner first started shooting at the cops near me - then that's a foreseeable outcome. You expect police to get shot at, and then send a social worker to handle the dispute?

If you woke, then wake up"
2007,2020-06-30 19:04:17,hinwks,"Jesus is King was dope and I‚Äôm not religious. Why do Kanye fans hate it so much? Is it because y‚Äôall really, really hate people talking about Jesus?"
2008,2020-06-30 17:09:47,hinwks,That‚Äôs tough
2009,2020-06-30 16:59:39,hinwks,"Nah, Jesus loves you"

2012,2020-07-01 08:49:07,hinwks,Fuck your downvoted. Easily the worst thing he has done
2013,2020-06-30 14:28:37,hinwks,"kanye: wow i just killed that verse glad i got that laid down in the studio 

*looks down at iphone in hand

kanye: not again üò∞üò∞üò•üòø"
2014,2020-07-01 02:16:17,hinwks,Aren‚Äôt there a few tracks on MBDTF that had a little bit of washed out vocals similar to this? Gorgeous comes to mind. I honestly don‚Äôt mind it.
2015,2020-06-30 14:28:20,hinwks,"I meant that I don‚Äôt think he intentionally made his vocals sounds washed out, I think he just recorded from his iPhone because he likes doing that"
2016,2020-06-30 16:20:25,hinwks,"The vocals on the last minute on Chanel and Gorgeous are very similar sounding.  Does that sound ""lazy"" to you?  I'd say it's what the artists wants you to hear"
2017,2020-06-30 17:14:08,hinwks,">https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/arthur-jafa-kanye-west-wash-us-in-blood-video-1202692840/

The production is actually amazing. The synths sounds eerie af and the transition from the hand drums to the slow build up of drums growing louder and faster is so neat. The chants then add a whole new layer to the song."
2018,2020-06-30 18:51:41,hinwks,No lol idk why he brought it up
2019,2020-06-30 16:46:37,hinwks,"It wasn't just him though, it's him Ronny Dre mixing  and like 30 other people credited."
2020,2020-06-30 14:17:33,hinwks,Facts. The vocals I record on my shitty mic in my room with no sound treatment sound better than this crap...rip Dre mixing
2021,2020-06-30 14:25:34,hinwks,More like üëÅüëÉüëÅ
2022,2020-06-30 19:15:01,hinwks,Kanye probably just uses Garage Band now lmao
2023,2020-07-01 02:17:09,hinwks,peep my username bruh don't take my bait.
2024,2020-07-01 06:48:19,hinwks,"Ok then,it would be completly ok for you if some random people aggressively forced themselves into your house without even telling you anything and then your partner who is reasonably scared for their lives, shoot one of them,so then one of them shoot you 8 times and all of that for no reason since you were not doing anything and you weren't even a criminal. Ok I get it,no need to talk more,peace out."
2025,2020-06-30 19:11:44,hinwks,It's cuz it's a mess. The lyrics aren't great the mixing abysmal. Since most ye fans have heard the yhandi leaks we know what we missed out on and having heard all his previous work this just doesn't hold up
2026,2020-06-30 19:50:56,hinwks,"The entire thing feels like it was slapped together with tape. Weak lyrics, poorly recorded vocals, bad mix, questionable production choices (why does the Kenny G solo just play with no beat behind!?!)

It's his worst album."
2027,2020-06-30 17:17:07,hinwks,[sorry](https://giphy.com/gifs/bbc-am-wests-V8vOT1JVj1ok)
2028,2020-06-30 14:33:47,hinwks,"0% chance he isn‚Äôt doing this for ‚Äúartistic purposes‚Äù of sounding washed out. He‚Äôs a producer first, the dude knows how mics work. He knows iPhone mics sound Garbo."
2029,2020-06-30 14:30:59,hinwks,[deleted]
2030,2020-06-30 16:44:30,hinwks,"no. it's extremely polished. Chanel is VERY well crafted song. There is in fact some light distortion on the vocals but theres also hella reverb that smooths it out and its EQ'd to perfection. (am producer)
What kanye has been doing with his vocals has been flat and tinny. You truly can record with almost anything these days and make it sound ""good"" and the fact the Kanye is refusing to do so or at the least pass it off to someone else (most producers dont do their own mixing) is just... so disappointing to me and my ears"
2031,2020-07-01 00:42:57,hinwks,Dude used Frank's production as a comparison.
2032,2020-06-30 16:55:00,hinwks,"well that makes me even more sad haha

willing to bet Kanye throws a song over to someone and doesnt let them work on it nearly as long as they would prefer"
2033,2020-06-30 14:39:46,hinwks,Dre just got divorced cut him some slack
2034,2020-07-01 03:28:38,hinwks,i'm talking the bootlicker you replied to g
2035,2020-07-01 11:46:24,hinwks,"Nah, it's fucked up having a no-knock night raid like that tbh - but seems justifiable in some rare occasions - just not this one, in hindsight at least.

But I'd also like to move the conversation to black people taking responsibility for the disproportionate crime rate. If her ex didn't deal drugs, or she didn't accept drugs for him - this tragedy wouldn't have happened. The community is an accomplice to this - but nobody wants to take responsibility for their shitty behavior, only throw accusations and demand everybody else to accommodate for their shit. It's tiresome.

I'd rather add funds to the police for proper training. European countries require 4 times as much training before becoming a police officer.


Or: shieeet, ACAB, shoot the 12 - we finna go anarchist in this bish

Peace out white homie"
2036,2020-06-30 19:50:46,hinwks,College dropout Ye would slap the shit out JIK Ye for the chick fil a track alone
2037,2020-06-30 19:52:52,hinwks,"You didn‚Äôt like how the sax solo went into that insane beat drop??? Wtf that was my favorite part of the song. I liked the lyrics, I liked the vocals, I liked the mix and I liked the production. I guess we can just agree to disagree."
2038,2020-06-30 17:48:54,hinwks,">he knows the iPhone mics sound Garbo


‚ÄúI just rap into my iPhone. Best microphone on the planet‚Äù - Kanye West, 2019"
2039,2020-06-30 14:32:44,hinwks,Idk I like it more as I keep listening to it but it was jarring at first. Sounds better with the volume way up
2040,2020-06-30 17:08:24,hinwks,>(am producer)
2041,2020-06-30 16:58:16,hinwks,"I'll clarify lol, Produced by Ronny, Kanye, Boog, FNZ, Dem Joints. Dre is credited on Kanye's Twitter for mixing, but who knows if it was just Dre or others helping."
2042,2020-06-30 17:14:57,hinwks,Damn I just saw that. Fucked up
2043,2020-07-01 03:35:09,hinwks,"I know,I was joking. I'm just fucking tired that when someone say some dumb shit and I point it out, people starts attacking me for pointing out by saying things like you took the bait and then downvoting me to oblivion."

2045,2020-06-30 19:55:16,hinwks,I‚Äôm happy he‚Äôs changed since then. I prefer JIK to College Dropout. I actually prefer post Graduation Kanye much more than pre Graduation Kanye
2046,2020-06-30 19:59:53,hinwks,The beat should have dropped halfway through that solo. It feels so awkward playing entirely alone
2047,2020-06-30 18:03:07,hinwks,quoting kanye is a dangerous game my mans has been known to exaggerate.
2048,2020-07-01 08:43:45,hinwks,Doesnt sound like a good review lmao
2049,2020-06-30 17:14:00,hinwks,never said i was a good one (am good actually) but that was there to explain the lingo (in case your girlfriend asks (cuz you have a girlfriend))
2050,2020-06-30 17:18:02,hinwks,Lol I‚Äôm just messin but yeah it is fucked up ha. I wonder how involved with gods country he was and if that‚Äôll throw a wrench in things
2051,2020-06-30 23:40:18,hinwks,No new workout plan slander allowed
2052,2020-06-30 19:58:09,hinwks,I respect your opinion as music is all about perception. Having said that my opinion is that you‚Äôre out of your mind to think JIK is a better album than college dropout lol
2053,2020-06-30 20:00:24,hinwks,Idk man I fucking loved it
2054,2020-07-01 00:32:03,hinwks,I like the song. I also like Closed On Sunday. I‚Äôm just saying they‚Äôre both ridiculous songs despite the fact that I love them both.
2055,2020-06-30 19:59:14,hinwks,That‚Äôs funny I was about to say I think you‚Äôre out of your mind.. hm. It‚Äôs almost as if music is subjective
2056,2020-07-01 00:33:23,hinwks,Oh okay word I misinterpreted it. I wish Closed on Sunday leaned slightly more in to the camp of its premise honestly because it could genuinely be a hilarious song but I think it sits at an awkward stage of being ridiculous and an actual song

Would you do something like: look for unusual activity that hasn‚Äôt led to a corresponding price increase? Or what?"
2095,2020-08-20 13:09:47,id9ty0,"Full disclosure, I am a mod over on the community page.  I promise if I had a differing opinion, I'd state it.

This tool is *sincerely* smoother, simpler to use, observe, and get notified by than anything I have set up on TOS/Cheddar/blah.  Even the free variation, just by following the Twitter or using the Discord notifications, is quite nice.  I think it is **supremely important** that we try and make tools that helps the ""retail trader"" get an edge...and I think we'd do that best if we worked together!  

There are so many new traders out there now and they are throwing their money--their livelihoods--at the market trying to make it big.  It breaks my heart seeing uncovered calls and puts without understanding what they're even investing in.  With education and the proper toolkit, I think we can see a lot of new players turn into experts within a year!

**So, seriously, if anyone has any thoughts or ideas for Mr. Whales above,** ***please let him know!***  

I firmly believe we can all get rich together by managing risk and playing smart (but sadly, there is no small amount of luck, which is why I think tools such as my TOS/VIX screeners and Mr. Whales' tool are so important!)."

2130,2020-08-20 12:46:51,id3uk1,"I‚Äôm not sure about these charts specifically but I have seen the association between 12th house and fame. I‚Äôm not an advanced astrologer but here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking: when a person becomes very famous or a symbol, they loose some ownership of their image and possibly of who they are (self-undoing?), they become part of the collective unconscious and can be deconstructed and reconstructed in a million different ways in other people‚Äôs minds and fantasies. Perhaps when the 12th house is activated by transit, profections or even zodiacal releasing, the person might become overwhelmed by this and choose to isolate themselves or become more private. I have no specific examples but maybe all the famous musicians that we see going into long periods of hiatus could be 12th housers? I also think fame in general can be an experience of seclusion because you might not know who to trust or who is only interested in you because of your fame (hidden enemies?)."

2133,2020-08-22 20:01:02,id3uk1,"Interesting topic! The 12th house can operate in a variety of ways; I'm glad you shared this. :)

I've noticed a strong 12th house in lots of the ppl I know well who are creative/artistic. I think that happens for a few reasons. First off, being creative is in itself a bit isolating. You might work by yourself for long hours, but even if that's not the case and besides that, having a strongly creative outlook is isolating bc it separates an individual from most people. A big part of creativity is seeing things abstractly; many other people don't process and experience like that. It's ""lonely"" being different. And it's not like a highly creative person is only like that while they're working; that's their nature, a big part of them always. So there's always a feeling, in some way, of being out of step, almost like existing in a different world from others. Creativity is also often highly individualistic...few people are creative in exactly the same way. So you're not sharing the creative process with another either, unless you work as a duo/team. But, even in that case, you're still a creative person outside of that shared work, so have that other scenario going on that I mentioned. The muse is also a part of creativity...It can feel like the Ego is weaker as the ""ethers"" communicate through the individual to create something. Creative ppl often talk about feeling like a conduit for something that came to them from beyond, and they had to ""birth"" that into being. The 12th can have that link, where one foot is in this world and one is outside it. All of this makes someone ""different"" in a way that can feel ""isolating.""

And I love what namacita's excellent points about fame as a 12th house experience.

..................................................

Regarding birth times...To check for reliable birth times, we can use [astrodatabank.](https://www.astro.com/astro-databank/Welles,_Orson) I'm linking to Orson Welles' page. You'll see there that his Rodden Rating is an AA. RR refers to how reliable the birth time is, and AA is as good as it gets. When looking at celebrity charts, I only trust A and AA charts, but you might find a different level that you're comfortable with. I also, when the info is available, read into what makes the reported birth time unreliable and sometimes trust it a little more than the rating reveals, depending on the details. But for any kind of astro analysis like this, I personally prefer to stick with A and AA.

That out of the way, of your list Judy Garland, Janis Joplin, and Orson Welles are all AA, and David Bowie is A. So I'd feel comfortable with them. Someone added Jimmie Hendrix. He's AA, so very reliable."

2171,2020-08-27 11:51:43,icztbd,"There's so much subliminal shade being thrown at Ye in this record it's unreal...


**The Record**

Let's start with the track itself. For me, the title ""Laugh now, cry later"" could have so many meanings. Ye is someone who considers himself as the king of rap but really, can he ever compare with Biggie and Tupac? Tupac has a tattoo that says ""Smile now, cry later"" on his back with a pair of tragedy masks. Is the story of Kanye not one of hip-hops biggest tragedies over the last decade? 

Also in Biggie's song Long Kiss Goodnight (which even just referencing could be a blow to Kanye's career, i.e. giving him the long kiss goodnight) Biggie says ""laugh now, cry later, i rhyme better"", which is maybe Drake doubling up on the message that Kanye's career is gone and Drake is the triumphant victor here? Tupac and Biggie are arguably raps greatest kings so referencing the both in a diss track to Kanye with this title feels like he's really trying to triple down even, on the message.

Then there's the feature. Kanye loves his hometown, Chicago. It seems too much of a coincidence that Drake would choose to use an upcoming drill rapper from Chicago of all places to deliver this message to Chicago's supposed golden child.

OK, so now the lyrics...


**Chorus:**

So we've spoken about the main line / title of the track already. Drake then says _""I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby""_ . Seems like he's talking about xannies? On Travis Scott‚Äôs 'Sicko mode' Drake similarly raps about taking half of a pill of Xanax to sleep on a flight. I might be clutching at straws but on 4th Dimension, Kanye raps about sleeping with his wife and says _""She said i'm going too fast, i'm exhausted""_. 

There's the rumours that Drake slept with Kim Kardashian at some point so could there also be a play on words here with the latter half of his sentence saying _""she took the whole thing, slow down""_ ? 

This could also then play into the double meaning with the next phrase _""We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town""_. Surely this is referencing both Kanye's tracks 'Yikes' and 'Ghost Town'. Drake infamously wrote the lyrics for 'Yikes' but didn't get credit initially. On Yikes, Kanye raps about tweaking of 2cb - a very trippy recreational drug. Also, going back to 'Sicko Mode', Drake again rapped _""I still got scores to settle, man, I crept down the block, Made a right, Cut the lights, Paid the price""_ . Both have houses in the same area so be talking about being on his block this feels like it's bringing up those same rumours again.

**Verse 1:**

_""Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react""_ must be talking about Kanye & Pusha T / G.O.O.D. Music. There was the beef that happened back in 2018 where eventually Pusha released 'The Story of Adidon' and Drake sarcastically sent Pusha and G.O.O.D. Music label an invoice for $100k for ""promotional assistance and career reviving"" as he promised he would on his previous retort 'Duppy Freestyle' ( _""Tell Ye we got a invoice comin‚Äô to you, Considering that we just sold another 20 for you""_ ). 'The Story of Adidon' was where Pusha exposed Drake for hiding a BABY he had with former pornstar, Sophie Brussaux. The track was, in turn, a response to Drake‚Äôs diss track 'Duppy Freestyle' which itself was a response to Pusha‚Äôs subs on his song, 'Infrared' - both tracks were released within 24 hours of each other. My read is that this whole song is Drake claiming victory over the whole beef saga, especially with Kanye's recent downfall. This would bring added significance to the highlighting of ""BABY"" throughout the song, but also seems like a fitting way to start the first verse - referencing where this all began and over what. 

Then he says _""Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that""_ . From what i've heard, at Drake's 33rd birthday party in Oct 2019, at one point the DJ started playing the G.O.O.D. Music‚Äôs remix of Chief Keef‚Äôs 'Don‚Äôt Like' which features both Pusha T and Kanye. The song only played for a few seconds before one of Drake‚Äôs close friends told the DJ to cut the song off. 

Then he says _""Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap""_ . The whole song is basically a victory lap at the expense of Kanye, but more specifically i think he's referencing the fact that he's managed to overcome a fair few beefs over the years, including Pusha T since 2011, Chris Brown in 2012, Common during 2012 aswell, Tyga in 2013, Meek Mill in 2015 and most recently with Pusha T, again. 

One of my favourite lines of throwing shade in this verse is then _""Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap""_ . Kanye signed a deal in Jun 2020 to bring his Yeezy clothing brand to Gap. While Ye is teaming up with this average flailing clothing brand, Drake has been a prominent figure for Nike throughout his career, and the record is shot at Nike‚Äôs HQ in Beaverton, Oregon. Closable gap could not only be referencing the distance between the two rappers now that Drake is so victoriously ahead he's taking a victory lap, it could also be alluding to the potential impending failure of Kanye's deal with the clothing brand, who's shares fell by 6% after Kanye threatened to walk away. 

Finally, _""I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up making it back""_ could again be referencing just how seasoned Drake is at winning whatever beef he seems to get himself into over the years and how this could likely be the end for Kanye.


**Pre-Chorus:**

_""I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad, What they had didn't last, damn, baby""_ feels like it could be a low blow at how Kanye's suffering quite a lot from mental illness at the moment and it's tearing his marriage apart. But, it could also just be that he's talking about Kanye getting upset at how life just isn't working out for him at the moment without specifically speaking to his mental illness.


**Verse 2:**

Not much going on here is far as throwing shade at Kanye but worth reiterating Drake chose a rapper from Kanye's home town to feature on this diss...


**Verse 3:**

_""When he tell the story, that's not how it went, Know they be lying 100%""_ . The first possible story / lie here could be a reference to the beef in 2018 when Pusha T called out Drake on the track 'Infrared' for supposedly using ghostwriters ( _""It was written like Nas, but it came from Quentin""_ ). Although Drake‚Äôs alleged ghostwriter, Quentin Miller, denied this story, Pusha then released 'The Story of Adidon' where he rapped about Drake's secret 'BABY' (_""You are hiding a child, let that boy come home, Deadbeat mothafucka playin' border patrol, Adonis is your son, And he deserves more than an Adidas press run; that‚Äôs real""_ ). Drake responded on his track 'Emotionless', saying _""I wasn‚Äôt hidin' my kid from the world, I was hidin' the world from my kid, From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate, Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate""_ , but since then Drake has maintained that Kanye must have told him about his son. Pusha denies this story as a lie, claiming that he found out from Noah ‚Äô40‚Äô Shebib, Drake‚Äôs trusted engineer and producer, however this was never confirmed by Drake‚Äôs closest friend. Lastly, in Dec 2018, Kanye went at Drake on Twitter and supposedly made up stories about Drake apparently threatening him. In the end, Drake just responded a series of laughing emojis on his Instagram. 

Going back to his secret 'BABY' however, he then raps _""Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea, And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it, It's hard to believe it""_ . As i mentioned, Pusha claims that it wasn't from Kanye he found this info that fuelled his diss track 'The Story of Adidon', it was actually from a woman that 40 was pillow-talking with. Drake's obviously then acknowledging this as the truth, hinting that maybe the woman regrets it, whilst also suggesting that he still thinks it was done intentionally.


**The Video**

The we've got the video itself...
As i said, the video is shot at Nike's HQ, perhaps drake rubbing in the superiority of the brand he has a partnership with and its prominence over lesser brand Gap (and potentially Yeezy). 

The shots with Drake and Lil Durk dressed in oversized suits with baseball caps is a reference to Drake being the king of rap / chosen one just like LeBron James, who can be seen in a similar shot (white suit and baseball cap) in his NBA Draft Day photoshoot.

The shot of him underwater boxing is a reference to Muhammad Ali's iconic underwater boxing photo from 1961 - again, another king of his field.

The slow-mo shot after drake gets tackled on the football pitch shows him and 3 others really exaggerating the fact that they're laughing and their faces can almost be said to resemble the crying laughing emoji. After Ye made up stories about Drake threatening him, Drake responded with simply 5 crying laughing emojis. Admittedly there's only 4 of them on the park bench but it could still be a subliminal nod of some sort? Especially as this comes just after he says ""So i bet they on they face right now"", i.e. talking about Kanye. In addition, add to that the fact that Odell Beckham Jr is wearing a red hat - just like Kanye and his MAGA hat?"

2175,2020-08-26 04:49:28,icztbd,"If you watch the music video, you'll see that the ""baby"" part of the chorus is heavily emphasized, with the dramatic pause before the phrase itself, as well as the camera zooming in on someone looking directly at the camera and mouthing ""baby""

I wonder if that's a reference to Adonis, considering this whole thing started with Kanye exposing Drake's baby boy"
2176,2020-09-02 21:57:45,icztbd,"""Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit"" is def not talking about Kanye, he's talking about X. And no clearly drake didn't do it himself directly, that would obviously be dumb. Im probably gonna get downvoted into hell but it's whatever."

2221,2020-09-07 12:23:49,io6coh,"Cor! That took awhile to do. I apologise if some of the charts are difficult to read and/or this is a bit of a mess. By the way, the last survey (from 2015) can be [found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/grime/comments/3nku0z/rgrime_survey_results_are_here/).

One question on the survey was about suggestions for the subreddit, which I'll roughly summarise below:

* Verifying grime artists who post here / may encourage more to post.
* More discussions about older grime and history. Maybe a weekly/month 'listening club', a weekly 'best songs', or weekly dives into MC's. Perhaps collaborative playlists.
* More instrumentals 
* Weekly noob threads
* Artwork threads
* More AmA's
* Maybe community competitions and such
* Megathreads for major things
* More female representation
* Harsher stance on non-grime
* New banner
* Better title regulation
* More visibility for fresh releases/sets
* Opening grime to non-grime discussions.
* Doing a better job of reflecting Black British conversations
* Space for physical release news


If anyone has additional thoughts on these let me know, but otherwise I will take some time to think of them. AMAs/QnAs seemed to be the most popular request, along with weekly/month posts. I have thought about replacing our [graffiti banner](https://i.imgur.com/XVqgcZL.png) before but I think finding a suitable replacement would be difficult."

Good lists but I'm surprised Ghetts didn't place higher in some of them.

Trim is definitely most underrated and could be in the top 5.

It's also crazy to me that people think Chip is overrated. He's absolutely insane, has some of the most enjoyable flows and energy of anyone to ever do rap let alone grime.

Also funny to see how clearly Boy in Da Corner is the best grime album of all time. It's not even a contest and it's pretty ridiculous that anyone would vote for anything else. I'd say it ones of the best albums of the millennium so far and it's impossible to understand how someone so young made something so good. I also think it shows a fairly distinct lack of quality when it comes to grime albums and I'm surprised that no one has really tried to echo his success by making a cohesive, unusual and fully immersive album with an actual grime sound throughout. I think someone could do it with the more modern grime sound that we see in producers like Murlo etc. Something that is still grime but pushes boundaries rather than staying within existing ones or venturing out only to go into other, more generic, pre-existing genres.

But remember there was a time when rock musicians didn't make proper albums either so that can change."

I got into grime around middle to late 2014 mainly thru the uk youtube scene(mainly the Sidemen) and their use of instrumentals. Since then they've stopped using the instrumental but I still really really enjoy the genre, especially in the gym"
2268,2020-09-07 13:45:19,io6coh,"For me he's probably top 5, maybe even 3. He just carries songs in ways that are hard to describe or put your finger on. It shouldn't work but it does. It's like Kendrick Lamar. Obviously Kendricks more heady stuff is pretty much just objectively good but then he has stuff like his verse on New Freezer or songs on DAMN that just work and it's hard to explain why. He just sounds better than other rappers. Chip embodies this on the LOMO2 intro.

I also used to think he lost his beefs because I bought into the gangster posturing of his opponents but now that I'm older I look at them and I can see he clearly destroyed those people. I think Peri Peri Sauce is one of the best diss tracks of all time in any genre. To be able to go up against street guys (as a rapper who is fairly obviously not violent) and to be able to subtly call them out on their shit but not come off as a pussy is quite an amazing tightrope balance to have pulled off. He's a very unique rapper. That said I don't really enjoy his rnb stuff at all and some of his more recent music is not all that good."

2285,2020-09-07 09:27:03,io2dij,"What I've noticed so far with the original mix is that a lot of points it was changed to have less panning, less delay & reverb with the lead vocals, some songs were re-arranged, and lyrics were altered. The drums are much better mixed, and it's an overall cleaner, louder experience. There are some points with this mix I think sound better, however a lot of tracks are so much better with the newer version anyways. Still, glad I gave it a listen because I've only listened to the most updated version."

Their hits don‚Äôt really speak of christianity but there are plenty more on-the-nose songs about christian values. They‚Äôre still gangsta,  though, since their take is like Jesus‚Äô: the values are good but the establishment is full of shit.

Very 90‚Äôs east coast vibe. 100% recommend."

2440,2020-09-07 17:40:57,inwl6a,[deleted]
2441,2020-09-07 19:22:20,inwl6a,"Exactly. I feel like there‚Äôs a good balance between secular music and Christianity out there;it‚Äôs something I can identify with and understand the references, so it becomes very enjoyable"
2442,2020-09-07 04:59:11,inwl6a,"The intro is one of the greatest intros of all time IMO. ‚ÄòUmi says‚Äô is a bop, ‚Äòdo it now‚Äô is also big. ‚ÄòMathematics‚Äô on there too. Whole albums is a must listen, Mos was really ahead of his time back then, still sounds fresh."
2443,2020-09-07 01:40:27,inwl6a,"Its throughout the album, the whole album is about kanye and cudis struggle with themselves and religion, on fire cudi sings ""heaven lift me up"" and on cudi montage he sings ""lord shine your light on me save me please"" Kids see ghost was Cudis first album after leaving rehab which he put himself into for depression and suicidal urges,  and kanye suffered similar things during the Pablo Tour. The whole album is about them being reborn, hence the song. Which is religious in itself. You should re listen to the album with this in mind."
2444,2020-09-07 13:43:17,inwl6a,Yeah you are lol it‚Äôs one of the main themes along with mental health and fame
2445,2020-09-07 03:45:23,inwl6a,The underground is where a lot of these mainstream people get their ideas and artists from
2446,2020-09-07 01:57:05,inwl6a,I just seen you reply to another comment and he/she mentioned Lecrae. My bad.
2447,2020-09-07 14:09:33,inwl6a,Great song too. Big up Common and big up Dilla.
2448,2020-09-07 17:53:39,inwl6a,"You‚Äôre right, I overlooked the ‚Äúundertone‚Äù part. I‚Äôll change my comment to something else then"
2449,2020-09-07 19:26:19,inwl6a,"Some albums go preachy, anti other religions and shit. That‚Äôs not good, considering a lot of atheists exist in today‚Äôs society and your cutting off that what 10-20 odd percent off your music. Even people of other religions aren‚Äôt gonna be interested in your music"
2450,2020-09-07 01:42:00,inwl6a,Awesome write up. I definitely have seen the mental health side of this album but never put the pieces together with the religion side. Thank you
2451,2020-09-07 01:58:04,inwl6a,"All
 Good no worries"
2452,2020-09-07 21:16:33,inwl6a,"True, but a lot of artists make music for themselves first, fans second. So, they probably don‚Äôt care about that sort of thing. To each‚Äôs own I guess"
2453,2020-09-07 01:51:32,inwl6a,"No prob,  kanye and cudi are two of my favorite artists and I think kids see ghost is a very important album for both of them because its where they finally seem at peace with themselves."
2454,2020-09-08 03:53:17,inwl6a,if i made music it would be for the fans. Being selfish isn't a good impression in front of the people that made you how you are
2455,2020-09-08 04:18:34,inwl6a,"I think it is one of those things where it‚Äôs for both. Everyone is different, I just know many artists see music as an escape or coping method with life experiences (all genres). Fans definitely play into that as well."
2456,2020-10-24 07:44:28,inwl6a,Then you probably wouldn‚Äôt be a rap artist. Maybe pop rap.
2457,2020-09-08 06:51:26,inwl6a,"the weeknd is a prime example of an artist who used fame to change his life, he was a homeless drug addict high school dropout who said he'd kill himself if he never made it"

2473,2020-09-07 03:42:49,insv2e,"Oh come on, this ""news"" is literally just her posting a photo of a pomegranate tree. Not even a mention of it being an Armenian symbol, not that she's even obligated to. And the second one is a video of a mother of 4 in a g string, prancing around with her sister. If she went to Armenia or said something relevant that's understandable. But neither of these things were newsworthy."

Viper should be crowned as goat. Viper should be crowned as president. Viper should be crowned as god! i love this album more than i love my own life. i'd rather drink piss than not listen to this album once a day. this album is perfect, and nothing in this world will make me change my mind. he should outsale Drake. he should outsale The Beatles! soundcloud would be nothing without Viper. what if Viper is actually a time traveller, that went back in the 80's and invented rap? actually, what if he invented vipers? what the fuck, this guy is a fucking genius. people see it as a joke, but it is a heavenly piece of modern art, a masterpiece. it should be treated as the woke piece of philosophical criticism it is. the production? it is perfect too. it captures the essence of the incredibly dense opinions spit by my man, Viper. this album is what Madvillainy could never be. Nas cries in the shower everytime he remembers Viper made an album better than Stinkmatic. the haters won't get it, but this is the best album of all time."

I love how much you love Iridescence. It's my go to BH album when I wanna listen to a whole concept/mood. It's probably my #1 as well, though I dont like picking favourites.

I tend to forget about Sat 2 and listen to Sat 3 more. 

But I gotta disagree with ATT, I totally get why the boys dont technically claim it as one, and why you think it's just ok. It is essentially a demo. But it's a bloody good demo and I love Michigan/Palace/Infatuation. 

I dont find Sat1 to have many outstanding tracks, though GOLD has grown on me again. But like you say. HEAT is a fucken banger. It's the stand out track on Sat 1.

Ginger is a hard one for me to rank cause you gotta be in the right mood for it, and when you are, its brilliant. But if your not, it changes your emotion. J think lyrically its outstanding. Joba on BIG BOY and LOVE ME FOR LIFE  is some of his best work. 
ST.PERCY is my overall favourite track on it.

2658,2020-11-09 13:48:08,jqwql1,The only person this is unpopular with is Kanye west.
2659,2020-11-09 12:53:24,jqwql1,I think the biggest Ye fans know that he isn‚Äôt the sharpest tool in the shed.
2660,2020-11-09 13:53:31,jqwql1,I don't think this is an unpopular opinion.
2661,2020-11-09 14:05:21,jqwql1,People mistake the word genius. He can both be a musical genius and need help. It is no secret that he suffers from Bipolar disorder. I‚Äôm sorry you had to deal with the arrogant Kanye camp. But I‚Äôm telling you there is no denying he‚Äôs a musical genius who needs mental help. A lot of geniuses suffer from mental illness
2662,2020-11-09 14:01:35,jqwql1,"Musically, he is quite genius. The way he utilizes the human voice and pioneered in a lot of things that are now commonplace. 

Mentally, I feel like a lot of people feel the need to comment on his health without understanding all that West himself has said about it in his music. Those ""I AM A GOD"" highs are often fueled by ""I want to harm myself"" lows., but people seem to think the first half is all that is to his in reality bipolar psyche. 

I'm a fan of his records, and seeing him definitely makes me sad. I want the dude to get some therapy or something that can further help him think about the way he approaches something and mentality because bipolar disorder is tough stuff man. 

I remember Mariah Carrey, and the way she talked about further being able to understand and control, for lack of a better word, the way she thought and approached things, as well as incorporating helpful drug and medication into it, and something like that would really benefit Kanye. 

Lastly, this isn't really an unpopular opinion? People saying he's a genius are 99% of the time referring to his creative abilities. Most people are aware of his public appearances and usually categorize him as an idiot but idk."
2663,2020-11-09 14:11:01,jqwql1,"From my experience whenever people call Kanye a genius it's in reference to him being a musical genius, which is reasonable. He definitely is one of the best producers in rap history, but he is by no means a genius in anything but producing."
2664,2020-11-09 14:11:19,jqwql1,"I mean he‚Äôs certainly a musical genius, he wrote or was a producer on multiple best-selling albums and changed how rap was made by his use of sampling."

2673,2020-11-09 13:58:06,jqwql1,"I mean. He went from being $50 mil in debt, to having a net worth of $1,3B USD, so he is kinda smart regarding making money."
2674,2020-11-09 14:15:33,jqwql1,"He is not a genius in the elon musk or Einstein sense.

He is a musical genius though. Anyone remotely involved in the hip hop or rap genre could not reasonably deny his genius.

Not his lyrics, because his lyrics can be really fucking hit or miss. His ear for production is still some of the best in hip hop, or better yet, it used to be. 

People that don't listen to him are probably just aware of his antics, but to deny the influence he has had in music would be just exceptionally arrogant."

2692,2020-11-09 14:28:31,jqwql1,"He is a genius, but not a genius in the sense you think. He is a genius when it comes to music, when it comes to production, when it comes to promotion, and when it comes to getting his message out. He is not a genius when it comes to common sense, history, politics, or anything a musician shouldn‚Äôt really need to let their opinion on. And, from personal experience knowing people who work with him, the man does not want help. He‚Äôs actually a very normal guy, it‚Äôs just in the public he tends to act crazy. He‚Äôs a genius until he‚Äôs in the public eye, he was a genius until he lost his mom and fianc√©, he was a genius until things started going wrong. He‚Äôs a genius, but he‚Äôs not a genius in the way you thing.

2697,2020-11-09 14:40:18,jqwql1,"Kanye West is absolutely a *musical* genius. It's difficult to make a convincing argument against that claim. His work has changed the landscape of modern hip hop on multiple occasions. Period.

He's also a deeply troubled person whose delusions of grandeur are a symptom of his mental illness. It's unfortunate for him that his massive fame exacerbates that issue and that every word he says is splattered on the front page of newspapers and magazines. 

But as Kanye himself said... ""name one genius that ain't crazy."""
2698,2020-11-09 14:44:33,jqwql1,"Do other people call Kanye a genius?
I've only heard him calling himself a genius."

2721,2020-11-09 14:08:32,jqwql1,This is unpopular? Lol
2722,2020-11-09 14:14:51,jqwql1,"I think that people mean that he is a genius in the music industry, and somewhat in the fashion industry. I disagree that he is a genius overall, but I think that he is still a smart man. He has many mental health issues, and often this makes him look less with it than he actually is. However you feel about his music, you absolutely cannot deny the affect he has had on music and hip hop. 808‚Äôs and Heartbreaks set the stage for hip hop and pop singers who didn‚Äôt have perfect singing voice, and he allowed these people to know it‚Äôs alright to use auto tune. He almost used it as an instrument in his music, often distorting it to sound less like his voice, like in runaway off of MBDTF. He is also a major part in opening the door for men in hip hop to express negative emotions. Before 808‚Äôs hip hop was all brovado, but now a days, new ‚Äúemo rappers‚Äù and even popular rappers like drake say that this is their most influential album of all time. He is also an amazing producer who has an uncanny ability to make amazing beats, and is constantly pushing the idea of hip hop forward. Simultaneously, he has been attempting to expand his yeezy brand. He has sold millions and regardless of how u feel about the look of them (personally not my favorite, but I understand why people do like it), you have to acknowledge the importance of this. Sure he can be an asshole, and Is sometimes crazy, but the amount he has changed the hip hop and pop genre is amazing."
2723,2020-11-09 14:15:13,jqwql1,"I think the problem is with people like you who take him so seriously. The Kanye you see in public is a character, how far away or how close that is to the person behind this character is unclear. But I see what he does as art in a way. He is a single person, a public figure who constantly accomplishes controversy. You would think that at some point people would be tired and could‚Äòt be shocked anymore. But he always follows through with something new. His fashion, music, family, political endeavors seem to shock people again and again. He marries a woman who is only known for a sex tape, but he defends her against all attacks and declares here as his true love, he releases clothes that cause media outrages for weeks. He sides with the most controversial president yet only to then run himself for president. He get‚Äòs massive responses to his tweets. He has a drastic turn towards religion which also caused heated debates among fans and critics. And that‚Äòs not even mentioning his music, which, unarguably is extremely artistically valuable, at times controversial, self reflective while deceptive and imo among the most important musical work of this century. And I think Kanye as this public figure holds a mirror up to the society around him. He didn‚Äòt make Trump president, he isn‚Äòt the first person who has their very own take on what it means to be christian, he is not the one who brought the fashion industry to where it is and so on. That‚Äòs why the responses are so strong. He‚Äòs one guy, he doesn‚Äòt matter. You can ignore him, but the things you hate about him are always there, he just put‚Äòs them in a spotlight."

2734,2020-11-09 14:12:06,jqwql1,I think he has some type of Aspergers sometimes alongside the bipolar we already know about. I‚Äôm not a pro but it‚Äôs clear that there is something going on with him and it sucks he‚Äôs on the world stage to be ridiculed and judged for it. If we were to small scale this-we would see it for what it is. It is verbally abusing someone with clear and severe mental health issues. I admire his strength. I do not think I would be able to survive what his life is right now. All the judgement and ridicule like he‚Äôs not even a human being. Then if god forbid anything happens to him everyone will be acting brand new. You‚Äôre right he does need help.

Kanye being delusional is considered a fact rather then an unpopular opinion. HE IS BIPOLAR, THATS A SYMPTOM. He is a bipolar with alot of money and influence, thats it. He has been to treatment for it.

If he just left it at the ""not genius"" part I guess it would be fine.

Also I'm only talking about his Music Career. People that say he would make a good president are just naive and delusional imo. He might have done some wrong/controversial things in his past and probably will keep doing them, but that doesn't make him dumb or a bad person in general. 

I feel like people only see the bad in him, because of his frequent Twitter rants, the Presidency and maybe even the Taylor thing, and  ignore the good things he's done as a human but also for the music indusrty!

Idk if this made any sense, I'm almost falling asleep while writing this lol"
2751,2020-11-09 14:23:03,jqwql1,"I agree he needs help, he is unwell (and off of meds last I heard)."
2752,2020-11-09 14:23:22,jqwql1,"Kanye is an incredibly smart person. Genius might be a stretch depending on your own definition. Im sure he already receives help for his mental health as should pretty much every big celebrity. While ye has his annoying ""stans"" it's just as annoying to see people online who want to shit on him and his family for clout. At the core they're all human beings just like the rest of us."

2754,2020-11-09 14:24:30,jqwql1,This would be more unpopular if the title was 'Kanye west is a genius he should be our president'
2755,2020-11-09 14:24:52,jqwql1,You first clue should've been him marrying a Kartrashian.
2756,2020-11-09 14:24:59,jqwql1,"While he is the richest musician of all time and he has a great discography I think Kanyes problem is that he is surrounded with yes men. And after the sad death of his mother he changed. While he definitely has a lot of ideas on a lot of stuff he is definitely not eligible on becoming president. I say leave him be, he'll release music for the fans, memes for the rest."

2764,2020-11-09 14:29:35,jqwql1,I bet his bank account is the reason he is so delusional...
2765,2020-11-09 14:29:45,jqwql1,He is a genius as an artist not as a person
2766,2020-11-09 14:29:54,jqwql1,This is a popular opinion.

2768,2020-11-09 14:30:07,jqwql1,"From your post, to me you come off as narcissistic and jealous of Kanye West. Pretty hard to convince me that somebody who is known for their music, completely changes the sneaker world isnt a genius. 

Is some of the stuff he says out there and strange? Absolutely but him sharing that stuff gives an authentic feeling since everybody has those moments. It also is extremely difficult for most of us to fathom having their basic privacy invaded for years on end and dealing with it. 

I mean just imagine walking outside to the car with your wife and child, with different random strangers taking pictures everyday. Imagine having to deal with Kim K and her family and not getting frustrated."

2774,2020-11-09 14:32:04,jqwql1,"He has revolutionised hip hop and in some ways the entire music industry. He is apparently worth 5 billion dollars selfmade. He has Pitchforks highest rated album of all time. He‚Äôs not very articulate and he has gone off the rails the last couple of years, but to write him off like that is just as wrong as claiming everything he has ever said or done was an act of genius."
2775,2020-11-09 14:32:07,jqwql1,"He is quite literally a musical genius, I'm not even a big Kanye fan but I can't deny that. His fans go overboard when they act like he's some kind of abstract thinker who we just don't understand. His opinions on everything besides music are usually bad"

Other than himself"
2777,2020-11-09 14:33:07,jqwql1,"I agree. And whats more, I don‚Äôt think people should use his mental disorders as an excuse for his awful behavior. If he is with it enough to run for president, he is with it enough to be responsible for his actions as in seeking treatment and not telling people in a speech about how you and your wife considered aborting your firstborn. That made me really angry because she will grow up and see that one day."

In his songs you can easily find very deep emotions express in his way of living. I think that he is, at least for me, a genius in the artistic field and I think that is rude and ignorant to say that he is not a genius, an appropriate way to speak your opinion would have been ‚ÄúKanye west has mental issues and so you shouldn‚Äôt take his opinions about politics and concrete stuff seriously but he can truly speak himself in his music/art, probably due to his condition‚Äù. I think that you haven‚Äôt listen to his albums and stuffs but you only judge him on his rant online. Pls give a try and enjoy his music üôèüèªüôèüèª"
2806,2020-11-09 14:42:27,jqwql1,"He is creatively brilliant. Resilient. Takes risks on himself. Intelligent.

Genius is too strong a word for his capabilities, and his inability to conquer his own thought. I am certain of that.

Me being a musician, and entrepreneur, who wants to also get into fashion, and ironically has also been diagnosed bipolar 7 years ago, I appreciate him a lot.

I also see mania in a lot of his outbursts. I often have been and still am the same, on similar levels, less severe levels. It's embarassing dealing with the aftermath of what got away from you. If I was a public figure with wealth on his level, I would have embarrassed myself on very similar levels. I feel for him, I appreciate his art, and his heart is very kind.

His thoughts are often misguided, or wrong, yet that is what bipolar does when flared up. The world around you, and you yourself, begin to communicate with you in ways that do not make logical sense. Yet you believe it. Most of it.

There's a small light in there that triggers when you went too far. That light is subjective to your health, and how the people around you react. 

Being a public figure, there is always a group of people to listen and agree with him. It's not something friends and family can easily control on his behalf. Medication can often stifle parts of us that we love most.

He's brilliant, he's got a chemical imbalance, he cannot split an atom if given the right tools."

2818,2020-11-09 14:45:30,jqwql1,"I watched Kanye‚Äôs interview with David Letterman last night and I think he‚Äôs misunderstood.

One thing that stuck out to me was he feels bad for the men in the metoo movement, I assume because it was so ingrained in the culture and lack of true justice procedures. But he is starting to ramble. David Letterman cuts him off and gets all preachy with audience applause.

But if you look at David Letterman, dude literally was sleeping with multiple members of his staff and fired one that spoke up. This was in 2009, lately instead of apologizing to the women he thanked the network for letting him keep his job. 

I think this proves Kanye‚Äôs point that maybe we aren‚Äôt treating this people completely fairly, especially if David Letterman gets a free pass then judges these men so harshly.

I really think Kanye‚Äôs problem is he can‚Äôt communicate and lashes out."
2819,2020-11-09 14:45:33,jqwql1,no one is claiming he's a genius in terms of academics or anything. However. he is a genius musically. Love or hate him he is an extremely influential man and on multiple occasions has paved the way for future artists and rappers to come. Plus the reason he says the absurd shit he does is cause he's bipolar and has very little people around him to help because of his trust issues.
2820,2020-11-09 14:45:47,jqwql1,wrong :)

Yes he's literally delusional that's how being bipolar works. Is there a group of people claiming his all right in the head? I've been a lifelong Kanye fan and r/Kanye knows better than anyone that he's crazy

On the genius part you can objectively say that his albums have been influential as hell. Hip hop literally wouldn't sound the same without him. Also he's pretty damn innovative. Not many artists have as varied of a discography as him. He's constantly switching up his sound which I would guess is a large part of why he's called a genius."

2847,2020-11-09 14:54:47,jqwql1,Hes definitely an interesting character. I didn‚Äôt think much of him either way but I enjoyed the joe rogan podcast with him recently. He has an interesting point of view. I do hate the khardashins though lol

But if you listen to his long-form discussions, he legitimately makes some very amazing points.  He's just horrible at presenting them, which is probably why he has to channel it through music so that at least it's controlled and simplified into feeling.

But yeah, he's definitely a very intelligent person.  He's also someone who suffers from some serious mental health issues too."

2864,2020-11-09 15:01:01,jqwql1,I think you‚Äôre very wrong. He‚Äôs very intelligent and you ooze jealousy.
2865,2020-11-09 15:01:03,jqwql1,"I agree with you, he lost his mind after his mom died."
2866,2020-11-09 15:01:05,jqwql1,"If you knew your history and meducal science, you would know that genius/creativity and madness go hand in hand. No one with above 145 in IQ is without a mental disorder. Creativity is especially liked to bipolar disorder, of which Kanye West suffers. He IS delusional BECAUSE he is genius. That's why most geniuses are not recognized untill after their death, when their madness no longer tarnishes their work."
2867,2020-11-09 15:01:09,jqwql1,pretty sure its a meme that kanye is a genius
2868,2020-11-09 15:01:11,jqwql1,I mean that's pretty obvious right?
2869,2020-11-09 15:01:31,jqwql1,Because no-one could be a creative genius as well as mentally unstable...
2870,2020-11-09 15:01:52,jqwql1,"He definitely needs help.

That said genius is something someone is within a specific field.

Fischer may have been a chess genius, doesn't make him competent enough to run a country.

The word ""genius"" is being abused."
2871,2020-11-09 15:02:07,jqwql1,I had no idea people believed this.  Why?
2872,2020-11-09 15:03:07,jqwql1,"You can be delusional and a genius, in fact having a creative mind can make you prone to delusion. example = Bobby Fischer.  Was totally a delusional antisemite  was definitely a genius in chess.  I'm not a kanye fan, bt I'd say he likely has a strong creative capacity but lavks self-awareness/introspection."
2873,2020-11-09 15:03:28,jqwql1,Shouldn't this be in r/popularopinion?
2874,2020-11-09 15:03:38,jqwql1,Everyone is different. Including the kid that ran like naruto in school.
2875,2020-11-09 15:05:01,jqwql1,"I do believe he's a good (even great) musician.

I also believe that the qualities which make him a great musician, such as his creativity and vision, are because he's mentally unstable.

He can be both at the same time. I can enjoy his music and be disgusted by his personality and entire being outside of his music. 

Like tom cruise."
2876,2020-11-09 15:05:13,jqwql1,"Unpopular opinion? 

This sub has truly gone to shit."
2877,2020-11-09 15:06:31,jqwql1,"Pitchfork disagrees I guess, making him one of the few artists to get a perfect 10 rating on one of his albums. 

Not to mention that his other discography is also good at worst. I think people struggle with the idea that a person can be great (not genius) and bipolar at the same time. While the artist himself tries to fuck his general image outside his fanbase by making such comments, the crowd outside, like OP makes the exact reverse comment. Both might be wrong"
2878,2020-11-09 15:07:14,jqwql1,Is this unpopular? I mean yes he has fans but they cannot believe anything else than this.
2879,2020-11-09 15:07:30,jqwql1,"It's the truth, not unpopular at all..."
2880,2020-11-09 15:07:33,jqwql1,So is Elon Musk.
2881,2020-11-09 15:07:39,jqwql1,"He's got bipolar. Genius lies somewhere between sanity and insanity (see Isaac Newton, Ernest Hemingway, Florence Nightijgale etc)"
2882,2020-11-09 15:07:40,jqwql1,This sub is getting so bad at posting true unpopular opinions.
2883,2020-11-09 15:07:51,jqwql1,"If anyone has any doubts whatsoever about his musical accolades:

I didn't bother including his musical awards like the Grammies, AMAs, because those are mostly popularity contests. But he has an [insane number of awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Kanye_West) if that's something you care about"
2884,2020-11-09 15:08:02,jqwql1,Also people unironically saying ‚ÄúKanye 2020‚Äù like we argue that the politicians we currently have are mentally ill but your bringing up someone who is proffesioneler diagnosed mentally ill
2885,2020-11-09 15:08:22,jqwql1,"I could be wrong, but people believe he‚Äôs a musical genius, not an intellectual genius. 

I can take Kanye‚Äôs opinion on beats, samples and anything hip-hop/rap with respect because he has performed at high levels in the industry. 

I, however, can not trust his opinion on anything that relates to the economy, foreign policy or general governance because he‚Äôs got no time in that arena or any achievements or experience to make him credible. 
 
He is kind of like Van Gogh... an artistic genius but crazy."
2886,2020-11-09 15:08:25,jqwql1,I don‚Äôt think this is unpopular
2887,2020-11-09 15:09:05,jqwql1,"We need a ""controversial but true"" sub. Anyone you fucking read my mind"
2888,2020-11-09 15:09:25,jqwql1,His best song was written by duft Punk...
2889,2020-11-09 15:09:47,jqwql1,Lol the only person who thinks Kanye West is a genius is Kanye West
2890,2020-11-09 15:09:56,jqwql1,"People say he's genius because of his music, not his shitty thoughts or actions. 


OP has clearly never listened to his music as he gave no personal opinion about it. That is what people call him a genius for. Not his unhinged bipolar ramblings."
2891,2020-11-09 15:10:05,jqwql1,"Despite the worship below, I don't think any seriously trained musician thinks he's a compositional or lyrical savant, just himself. Kanye elucidates the human condition, which is insanity..."
2892,2020-11-09 15:10:18,jqwql1,"He is easily most influential artist in the last decade and he is legit musical genius, anything else is just said by stubborn people who like to hate"
2893,2020-11-09 15:10:30,jqwql1,"He doesn‚Äôt make good music. He steals OTHER people‚Äôs good music, flips a switch on a sequencer, then yammers self-important, tuneless bullshit over it. He‚Äôs only good at ruining better music made by actual musical geniuses."
2894,2020-11-09 15:10:46,jqwql1,"There are performers, like Prince, who actually are on another level and I do truly believe are geniuses. Kanye is not one of those performers."
2895,2020-11-09 15:11:01,jqwql1,We know.
2896,2020-11-09 15:11:05,jqwql1,"Now go google Daniel Johnston another bipolar singer songwriter. I‚Äôm really unfamiliar with Kanye beyond a few songs so this next statement might be controversial (and wrong) but I‚Äôd argue that Daniel Johnston is the bigger bipolar songwriter if we are focusing on all the people who had hits covering Johnston‚Äôs works. 

‚ÄúIn 2004, he released The Late Great Daniel Johnston: Discovered Covered, a two-disc compilation. The first disc featured covers of his songs by artists including Tom Waits, Beck, TV on the Radio, Jad Fair, Eels, Bright Eyes, Calvin Johnson, Death Cab for Cutie, Sparklehorse, Mercury Rev, The Flaming Lips and Starlight Mints, with the second disc featuring Johnston's original recordings of the songs.‚Äù

....just to name a few"
2897,2020-11-09 15:11:54,jqwql1,Did someone actually say he‚Äôs a genius?
2898,2020-11-09 15:12:01,jqwql1,I think he may be a musical genius but everything else he does and says I take with a grain of salt
2899,2020-11-09 15:12:19,jqwql1,"This is one of the most popular, commonly expressed things in pop culture. 

This sub sucks so much"
2900,2020-11-09 15:12:27,jqwql1,"No, yeah the dude is fucking bst shit crazy.. I couldn't get thru the interview... Alex jones latest interview was a breeze compared to Kanye.."
2901,2020-11-09 15:12:27,jqwql1,"He‚Äôs a genius when it comes to music, but he definitely isn‚Äôt a genius beyond that."
2902,2020-11-09 15:13:07,jqwql1,His chat with Letterman showed he and the audience were unhinged.
2903,2020-11-09 15:13:09,jqwql1,Artists tend to be kinda strange.
2904,2020-11-09 15:13:11,jqwql1,This is a popular opinion in my neck of the woods. Sadly he has enablers around him telling him what he wants to hear.
2905,2020-11-09 15:13:20,jqwql1,"Sadly yes, currently he is mentally on a completely different planet, and not in a good way. 

From a music professionals perspective though (pre-COVID), in terms of music production, he was on his own level when it came to his work for a 4-5 year stretch there when it all started with the album Graduation. Hell, even his gospel album got exceptional reviews from the religious music enthusiasts a couple years ago.

So definitely not an unpopular opinion you gave, but I do feel obligated to give credit where credit is due to an extent."
2906,2020-11-09 15:13:45,jqwql1,i think as an artist he‚Äôs a genius but he does have many problems and yes he does need help
2907,2020-11-09 15:14:01,jqwql1,"Saw a lot of comments saying hes a musical genius.i like kanye,i like his albums but hes not a musical genius in any way shape or form.If you listened to 3 music genres and 14 artists in your whole life including kanye yes hes a genius but if you know a lil bit about music hes just another musician with a lil bit more succes that your average musician ."
2908,2020-11-09 15:14:12,jqwql1,"There is a very fine line between genius and nonsense, and Kanye is very much on the side of nonsense. I trust no one who thinks otherwise."
2909,2020-11-09 15:14:46,jqwql1,"I have an idea for a Skyrim mod: As soon as you hit 100 in any skill people start asking for your opinion in politics. Like, you make a bajillion daggers, hit 100 in smithing and then random people on the street ask you about Stormcloaks vs Imperials.

This would be to add realism."
2910,2020-11-09 15:14:51,jqwql1,"I guess my opinion is unpopular, because Kanye one Joe Rogan didn't say a single thing I disagreed with for like the first 45 minutes.  After that, I stopped keeping count.

I don't even like his music very much.  But me and him are two peas in a pod."
2911,2020-11-09 15:15:17,jqwql1,People in general need to stop pretending they know something everyone else doesn't to make themselves feel special. That's how Trump became president.
2912,2020-11-09 15:15:27,jqwql1,Oh he is a genius-*but not a musical genius.* He is god of hype and ego. He has many people convinced his music is more than mediocre.
2913,2020-11-09 15:15:29,jqwql1,Please remember to downvote popular opinions.
2914,2020-11-09 15:15:44,jqwql1,He can be both a genius and need help.
2915,2020-11-09 15:16:08,jqwql1,I'm gonna be honest I have never heard of kayne west expect that he was a person who made music or atleast tried or something like that and the whole thing where he might be running for president or some shit like that
2916,2020-11-09 15:16:11,jqwql1,Lol who really believed that
2917,2020-11-09 15:16:19,jqwql1,"Kanye is literally losing brain matter from his untreated bipolar disorder. It‚Äôs called grey matter thinning. As long as he‚Äôs off his meds, it will continue until he has early onset dementia or Alzheimer‚Äôs."
2918,2020-11-09 15:16:31,jqwql1,I think kanye is good at making music but even the majority kanye fans don't like him as a person.
2919,2020-11-09 15:16:47,jqwql1,"I read this backwards. Thinking you said he is a genius. I was like, "" wow that is a really unpopular opinion."" However I was wrong."
2920,2020-11-09 15:16:47,jqwql1,Rich people are usually ‚Äúright‚Äù about everything.
2921,2020-11-09 15:16:54,jqwql1,Tne only person I've heard call Kanye a genius is Kanye. I can't see anyone else saying that unironically.
2922,2020-11-09 15:17:03,jqwql1,This is as unpopular as not wiping after taking a dump.
2923,2020-11-09 15:17:11,jqwql1,"I downvoted, not because I disagree (I **do** disagree, though), but because it's not unpopular, at all."
2924,2020-11-09 15:17:20,jqwql1,"People who consider his music to be genius are just caught up in the emotional impact his music has on them personally. 

That's part of what music does; it makes contact with your brain via your ears and makes it light up in different ways. You'd be hard pressed to find anyone that would have something negative to say about someone who can accomplish that.

That being said, thousands upon thousands of other artists from all genres do that. Repeatedly.

Nobody has a monopoly or an edge on anyone else for song-writing. It's not genius. Human beings are creative by nature and we respond especially well to creative output from others, and that sliding scale of response to creative stimuli has SO many variables influencing the result that it's nearly impossible to accurately gauge anything.

Suffice it to say, if you like Kanye West, leave it at that. That means he's doing what he's supposed to. Calling him a genius is reactionary and is dismissive of the entire process of creation."
2925,2020-11-09 15:17:22,jqwql1,Why is this being upvoted so many times? Is this satire?
2926,2020-11-09 15:17:33,jqwql1,"His heart's in the right place, his head is all over the place."
2927,2020-11-09 15:17:44,jqwql1,He's the next cult.  Mark my words.  He talks about himself the same way a current cult leader does and so do his followers.
2928,2020-11-09 15:18:12,jqwql1,"Is this a popular opinion? I'm honestly asking it, because everyone I know, even the ones who like his music, thinks he's out of his mind.

Also, gay fish."
2929,2020-11-09 15:18:30,jqwql1,"Uhhhhhh, I‚Äôve heard his music. Man is obviously mentally ill"
2930,2020-11-09 15:18:49,jqwql1,Yeah he is mentally ill and should get the help he needs
2931,2020-11-09 15:19:01,jqwql1,"Musical genius, but an idiot savant so that's like his only talent."
2932,2020-11-09 15:19:05,jqwql1,"I haven't heard the whole thing - your post is reminding me to listen through fully.  He seemed to start quite well but then he started banging on about stuff in a way that pricked my ears up.  I was busy but I properly caught sections of this.  I work with people with disabilities and mental health issues.  His tone of voice and some of the content made me wonder.  

Rogan is no idiot though and I heard the start without knowing who he was interviewing and was pretty impressed with how he described West.  And it is dead right that those who see things differently and seek to change things up a few notches can be brilliant and also nuts."
2933,2020-11-09 15:19:12,jqwql1,School Spirit Skits #1 and #2 were prescient
2934,2020-11-09 15:19:26,jqwql1,HES A SCIENTIST
2935,2020-11-09 15:19:40,jqwql1,Kanye seems to be in a similar place as to when Bam Margera had his mental breakdown. He needs to see someone about it.
2936,2020-11-09 15:20:12,jqwql1,Woweee good one man. I bet it took a ton of courage to post this popular opinion
2937,2020-11-09 15:21:11,jqwql1,He has Bipolar disorder so he is quite literally insane
2938,2020-11-09 15:21:12,jqwql1,How is this unpopular??
2939,2020-11-09 15:21:36,jqwql1,"It surprised me to see somme people think kanye west is a genius??!!!! I don't even like his songs... 

in fact it's a very popular opinion....maybe not in US..."
2940,2020-11-09 15:21:42,jqwql1,"His older music was alright, but come on man seriously? We ALL know Kanye is bat shit crazy. This sub is pure trash"
2941,2020-11-09 15:22:18,jqwql1,"God told him in the shower that he should be the leader of the free world. If that‚Äôs anything other than a completely sane and rational occurrence, I don‚Äôt know what is."
2942,2020-11-09 15:22:23,jqwql1,"Idk, I think you can totally be a genius, be insane and need help. Probably more common than not."
2943,2020-11-09 15:22:32,jqwql1,"When I say Kanye West is a genius, I mean musically. No way that dude is any smarter than the average person, in fact I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more likely he goes the other way."
2944,2020-11-09 13:10:40,jqwql1,I didn't think it was that hard to follow what he was saying on JRE. Yes Kanye is pretty turbulent and says wild things but that's because he speaks his mind.
2945,2020-11-09 12:54:15,jqwql1,He‚Äôs a musical genius if you actually have listened to his albums
2946,2020-11-09 13:52:52,jqwql1,He likes fish sticks tho
2947,2020-11-09 14:07:26,jqwql1,His music is amazing. However he isn't the sharpest tool in the shed - that I agree with
2948,2020-11-09 14:11:40,jqwql1,I think he is bipolar.
2949,2020-11-09 14:28:34,jqwql1,This is definitely not an unpopular opinion. Kanye needs help.
2950,2020-11-09 14:32:01,jqwql1,Definitely president material
2951,2020-11-09 14:44:21,jqwql1,Even his music is shite.
2952,2020-11-09 14:44:47,jqwql1,"He doesn't make good music though, he made a few decent songs that's it. If he's a music genius than so is Abba"
2953,2020-11-09 14:46:44,jqwql1,"I say he sucks at music, too. ""I'm a sick fuck, like a quick fuck"" isn't lyrical genius, it's smut. 

Nothing about Kanye West strikes me as insightful in any way. He strikes me only as self-absorbed and egotistical."
2954,2020-11-09 14:46:47,jqwql1,"He's an idiot, and his music sucks."
2955,2020-11-09 14:49:59,jqwql1,"His ""fans"" need to be called out for enabling his behavior and using his mental health as entertainment."
2956,2020-11-09 14:50:23,jqwql1,He doesn't do good music.
2957,2020-11-09 14:50:50,jqwql1,This guy is a walking cringe fest and beyond annoying.
2958,2020-11-09 14:51:08,jqwql1,He's not even a good musician. He's produced by an army
2959,2020-11-09 14:52:33,jqwql1,His music is shit as well. Don't know why people act like it's good. Dude hasn't made good music in 10 years.
2960,2020-11-09 14:53:10,jqwql1,"I guess it's relative but I really think he is one of the greatest musicians EVER. 

His political and philosophical views are pretty uncollected."
2961,2020-11-09 14:57:27,jqwql1,"Kanye is a MUSICAL genius, and definitely a good entertainer. 

That does not mean he's good at other things."

2970,2020-11-09 14:27:18,jqwql1,I cannot stand that guy and his music trash in my opinion. I don‚Äôt even know him either which is funny. I just can tell he would absolutely suck to hang out with. He seems the type to talk for hours about how great he is.
2971,2020-11-09 14:41:20,jqwql1,Ahem ‚Äúmusical genuis‚Äù....... (please ignore his recent projects and focus on everything pre 2019)
2972,2020-11-09 14:47:16,jqwql1,"He's a mother fucking lyrical wordsmith!

Now tell me why I'm a gay fish."
2973,2020-11-09 14:49:26,jqwql1,He's a musical genius there's no question about that

Kanye is a fucking god end of."

2976,2020-11-09 15:01:32,jqwql1,The fact that America would rather vote for two senile old men then vote for a visionary who wants to try something different really shows how far behind we are socially.

2977,2020-11-09 15:06:32,jqwql1,Wow such edge
2978,2020-11-09 15:07:28,jqwql1,"Yeah, we know. It's why him being an insane person is fun to watch."
2979,2020-11-09 15:14:14,jqwql1,Kanye is smarter then you give him credit for and also he has publicly said he has bipolar disorder so it‚Äôs not shock to me that you think he‚Äôs off but to call some one crazy and all this other crap is ridiculous. By what standers? You don‚Äôt like the way he talks so it‚Äôs crazy? He made some really good points in that podcast.
2980,2020-11-09 15:17:41,jqwql1,People think Kanye is a genius?
2981,2020-11-09 15:21:32,jqwql1,This is unpopular?

3007,2020-11-09 14:39:39,jqwql1,"I think we as people have to admit someone can be a genius at one thing and not the other. Kanye is no doubt a musical genius. Einstein is a math genius. Should either be making social policy, fuck no. They think on a different wave length, that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre geniuses.

I do feel Kanye is misunderstood and attacked though."
3008,2020-11-09 14:47:00,jqwql1,"You'd be surprised. I thought I'd never meet anyone who actually considers him a genius unironically. Then I find out two of our ""friends"" who I thought were sensible people love him. They think he's a genius and on a whole different level and honestly I lost so much respect for them when I found this out."
3009,2020-11-09 14:58:14,jqwql1,"I always hate how people are like ‚Äúhe has mental illness‚Äù. OK that‚Äôs fine. So why hasn‚Äôt he spend his millions on getting professional help then? He‚Äôs a fully grown adult, he know what he‚Äôs doing, he just doesn‚Äôt care what it looks like."
3010,2020-11-09 14:26:40,jqwql1,"There are only 10 people in history that have more Grammy awards than he has, he is definitely a genius.

""genius"" (an exceptionally intelligent person or **one with exceptional skill in a particular area of activity**.)"
3011,2020-11-09 14:29:49,jqwql1,"I believe he's a musical/marketing genius and a lot of his support comes from people who want a piece of that action, especially in the celebrity circles but i don't think anyone argues that he's a genius outside of being able to arrange a song or market a shoe. 

I'd say I listened to everything he put out before he went full gospel, and If i believed he was a musical genius then it still holds true despite whatever he does beyond music.

I feel bad for him because it's his hanger-ons  even publicly stated he's mentally unwell but won't do enough to help because he's part of their brand now and having him shut down and receive actual help would be a monetary hit. it's pretty sad"

3018,2020-11-09 14:26:47,jqwql1,Yeah I kind of feel bad for him to be honest. I‚Äôm bipolar II so I don‚Äôt have full on manic episodes but it still sucks not being able to control your own brain sometimes. I think Kanye has bipolar I which is more intense and harder to manage. If dude would just stay on his meds he‚Äôd be fine and probably feel a lot better too.
3019,2020-11-09 13:48:51,jqwql1,This
3020,2020-11-09 14:46:49,jqwql1,Good morning Kanye
3021,2020-11-09 14:49:55,jqwql1,"He also suffers from malignant narcissism, too. What people call ""being on another level"", I call needing serious help and several medications. 

I mean seriously, if the man hadn't gotten lucky with his music career, he would be just another crazy dude on the street corner screaming about how he would be jesus in the new bible."

3024,2020-11-09 15:14:34,jqwql1,He claimed that solar panels were bad because they output DC electricity and DC electricity is bad because Tesla (correctly) wanted grid AC but had to fight for it. That shows a complete and utter fundamental misunderstanding of electricity.
3025,2020-11-09 15:08:39,jqwql1,"He rambles a lot for sure, and starts different thoughts before finishing old ones.  However, I remember thinking he had some interesting ideas.  Do you remember anything specific that made you think he doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on?"

3030,2020-11-09 15:19:57,jqwql1,"While i agree with you, I wouldn‚Äôt exactly put Kanyes music in ‚Äúgenius‚Äù territory. As lyricists go he‚Äôs pretty mediocre, and i‚Äôm not sure if he still produces any of the beats on his albums anymore. (Too lazy to look up) but musically they‚Äôre not really ground breaking or anything."
3031,2020-11-09 15:21:54,jqwql1,"His music is far from exceptional and doesn't remotely approach Genious level. 

Kanye has a bit of talent for sure, but lets not mistake marketing for skill."

3034,2020-11-09 14:32:26,jqwql1,Absolutely nailed it - this perfectly encapsulates my thoughts on Kanye.
3035,2020-11-09 14:23:23,jqwql1,This exactly. Bobby Fisher is a raving lunatic who clearly has some underlying issues but you‚Äôd be hard pressed to say he isn‚Äôt a genius in his particular respect
3036,2020-11-09 14:24:51,jqwql1,"Exactly I‚Äôm not sure that OP knows that genius doesn‚Äôt refer to intellectualism all the time, I would call Leo Messi a genius, but he hasn‚Äôt been in school past the legal requirement, genius is more than Einstein, but like Einstein said, if you judge a fish in it‚Äôs ability to climb a tree, you will think the fish is stupid"
3037,2020-11-09 14:27:39,jqwql1,"In what way did he pioneer anything? And what so special about the way he uses his voice? 
No salt, genuinely curious"
3038,2020-11-09 14:28:10,jqwql1,"It really comes down to how you define the term ""Genius"". You're correct in that the mistake made by OP is acting like anyone calling him a genius means they think he is extremely smart and the things he says are insightful. I guarentee that is almost never the case. Musically, he is one of the greatest producers of all time and that isn't really up for debate. 

Kind of a dumb post really."
3039,2020-11-09 14:51:27,jqwql1,"The whole ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a musical genius‚Äù is overplayed too. He‚Äôs a genius because he ‚Äúpioneered‚Äù auto tune? We need to stop casually tossing around the word genius like an insecure sorority girl. These people might be ‚Äògenius‚Äô in the literal sense that they have exceptional creativity and talent, but using the word genius puts them in the same category as Albert Einstein and Stephen hawking which just serves as an ego boost for these rappers/athletes and makes them think they should run for president for example"
3040,2020-11-09 15:07:45,jqwql1,"I think it's largely a problem of people being too young to remember ringtone rap and taking a lot of advancements in the genre for granted. The idea of introspective, intricately produced, experimental hip-hop going mainstream used to be unthinkable."
3041,2020-11-09 15:01:23,jqwql1,"> Musically, he is quite genius.

I keep hearing this, and I listen to his music to try to catch this ""genius"" and I am not impressed, at all.... wildly overrated!"

3044,2020-11-09 14:31:58,jqwql1,"Part of that is him though. He goes on and off his meds and bipolar is a condition that you have to stay on meds to manage. He can afford the best therapists there are but he doesn‚Äôt seek that out. 

In a way I get it, he channels his illness into his music which generates more sales, more fans, etc. So I‚Äôd be willing to bet that at least part of him thinks if he takes his meds he will lose his career. 

However, he still has a choice there. It‚Äôs a choice to take meds for a mental illness, and bipolar people in particular struggle with that, but ya know. He has the resources to help himself."
3045,2020-11-09 13:49:56,jqwql1,That's good that he can channel his mental illness into music. He certainly can't channel it into conversation because the man struggles very hard to keep on topic and not launch off into 9 different metaphors until he forgets where he started from.

3054,2020-11-09 14:26:11,jqwql1,I know right? Like why is he a genius but like Kendrick Lamar isn't? Do they think he is genius just because he can sell a lot of albums or whatever? As a musician it just sounds like more pop music. Nothing worse or better than any other pop musicians.  Seem like a cult of personality that constantly over-inflates his musical abilities.

But to be fair, to say ""in history"" sort of sounds like we are looking back at the dawning of time. The Grammys have only been around for 60 years. Rap has only been a part of that for like 31 years. Neither is a very wide window. And he is only like top 10 for specific male performers.

Interesting ideas that get word vomited out and then never touching the question is one sign of not knowing what's going on.

I know he picked up some votes here and there but I interpreted them as protest votes for people who hate trump and biden, not because people actually thought he would be a good president.

His influence on modern hip hop is practically unmatched and we can't really measure how much he has influenced it. Does he do really stupid shit in the public eye? Yes. Does that take away his musical achievements? Not really. his last album was doo doo tho

some artists that he's influenced?

2. Logic (he's not the greatest but he's a pretty big rapper that kanye influenced that people think is good so it's fair game)
3. Chance the Rapper
4. Kid Cudi

He certainly has his own style but the impression I get going through this sub and watching the vox video is he isn't all that different to other musicians, most have hardcore fans who will always claim that whoever they like is the best.

 Kanye definitely has a bigger following but he's been pretty successful in other areas and they feed into each other, all boils down to hes pretty savvy at marketing, promotion and producing, but genius? I think a stretch, either way its been interesting learning more about him, definitely a better musician than I thought, but imo, not as good as many claim. Its a shame people are straight bashing him on here though."

Doug"
3193,2020-11-09 15:15:34,jqwql1,"No. What you said is just wrong. 808's and Heartbreak was a major influence for most rappers of the 2010's and that album was completely distant from the norm of hip-hop at the time and was not cliche in the slightest. College Dropout had legendary production which is why songs such as ""Jesus Walks"" are considered classic and landmarks for hip-hop. On Late Registration Kanye worked with popular composer Jon Brion and used a live orchestra to make the production much more lush. And arguable Kanye's best album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, is considered by many to have an amazing maximalist style of production. To simply dismiss Kanye as cliche is stupid as Kanye set trends for hip-hop and produced many albums that are now considered classics.

The entire thing is a breakup album, and the autotune makes it resonate with the listener more. You can feel the hurt in your chest. No one had done that before. 

Kanye's use of autotune isnt genius because he used autotune, it's genius because he figured out a way to use it as an instrument to convey emotion. Shit he used it on Runaway super oversaturated as an instrument and it almost came off like a guitar solo"

3236,2020-11-09 15:11:43,jqwql1,"I think when people try to explain Kanye‚Äôs genius, they‚Äôre really trying to explain two things.  His pivotal role in the world of hip hop that we have today, meaning only, a style that is prevalent in almost everything you hear now today which he pioneered.  And the second thing is, his awareness that he is pioneering something that hundreds of people in the future will try to emulate once he‚Äôs pioneered it.  That‚Äôs where grandiose Kanye comes in to piss people off.  He says he‚Äôs going to do something and tells you that it will stick and then 8 years later you ‚Äúlook and look around and there‚Äôs so many Kanye‚Äôs‚Äù - Kanye

Last bit to add is also that hip hop is seen as not only a music aspect but also a marketing and business aspect, a general ask of any hip hop endeavor is ‚Äúis it good, and will it help you make it out the hood‚Äù and Kanye‚Äôs business mindset combined with his creative mindset answer both of these questions.  He‚Äôs not locked down to one industry, and he‚Äôs been massively successful in many different worlds.  Making out of the hood is not easy and staying as relevant as he is is a feat at almost 50 is crazy.  You‚Äôd think kanye was 22, had a hit on the radio, and is involved a scandalous affair as much as he is in the news currently and has remained.  This isn‚Äôt pure luck but hey that‚Äôs just me as a stan"
3237,2020-11-09 15:19:27,jqwql1,"I‚Äôm not a fan of Kanye but I understand people calling him a genius and won‚Äôt argue it. I posted elsewhere in this thread about another bi-polar songwriter Daniel Johnston. If you listen to his music before you listen to all the covers you will be turned off by his squeaky voice and childish musical abilities. But enough big names heard and covered his music, and then had huge hits with them. And the big names cover all the bases from Tom Waits to Yo La Tengo to Nirvana. There were bidding wars to get him signed to a label. 

And this is from a guy who thought he was Casper the Friendly Ghost when he was in his manic throes.

1. You surely aren't grouping someone like Travis Scott or Don Tolliver into that "" trashy"" stereotype are you? dig more in the crates, you'll be surprised

2. definitely yes, there are tons of influences, but fact of the matter is without 808s and Heartbreaks rap wouldn't be the same.

3. he hasn't contributed anything? buddy have you read this thread? that's just plain ignorant. 

4. ""50 years from now people will be still listening to black sabbath and queen"". I hate to say it but those artists and genres aren't really that popular now? rap definitely isn't going away too so wtf."
3249,2020-11-09 14:53:01,jqwql1,"I mean my paraphrase was literally from that same podcast. Full disclosure - I don't listen to his music, or really any music at all, for that matter. But I wanted to hear him speak for myself, rather than make assumptions on someone's character based on mainstream and tabloid culture.  

The dude is... chaotic good. That's my big takeaway. From what he said to how he said it, the dude doesn't seem to have a bad intention left in his body, and I can forgive a lot in the way of conventional conversation for something rare like that. Not to mention, as someone else commented, the dude lives with a coven of mk-ultra witches, so further props to him for keeping his shit together as much as he does while staying true to himself.

All that said, my favorite quote of the podcast which I've repeated whenever I feel tested, ""They ain't gonna come for me till He done with me!"""

""Generic and soulless"" is far from what Kanye's discography represents. Nearly every single one of his albums was groundbreaking in hip hop and influenced countless peers and new artists in the following generations. 808's and Heartbreaks probably inspired more artists in the genres of Hip Hop and R&B than any other album in the last 20 years. Many of those artists such as Drake and The Weeknd became the top artists of their genres and have mass crossover appeal. And his first two albums are nearly entirely made up of beats sampled from soul music, and you call his music soulless."

Newton just ""set a trend"" when he invented newtonian physics lol. 

Like it or not, a genius in music, fashion, film, literary pursuits, etc. is just as valid as a STEM genius."
3299,2020-11-09 15:18:15,jqwql1,it definitely has! but the way he incorporated new techniques into the genre really pushed it forward with digital tools like autotune and 808s.
3300,2020-11-09 15:16:52,jqwql1,"He literally revolutionized rap with 808s and heartbreak. Tpain did his work with autotune, kanye was able to pick up on that sound and realize it lended it self well to the feeling of anguish, and then created an entire album about it. That creation led the way for the next ten years and was a direct influence on drake's entire sound which was then copied by an entire generation. People started moving away from tough guy rap and moved in a more introspective emotional direction. Travis scott's auto tuned sound in his music is entirely attributable to kanye. His style of production from early years directly influenced producers for the next decade and shaped the sound. When he made yeezus, even though it was not loved by a lot of people at first, the landscape of rap as a whole became more aggressive. Kanye's music directly influenced the entire industry and pushed it in new directions all from ideas he has had. Yes he's bipolar and most often off the deep end and nonsensical when he speaks. But he is also a *musical* genius. The two aren't mutually exclusive."
3301,2020-11-09 15:11:22,jqwql1,"here's a few things HE ACTUALLY DID pioneer the use of: 

1. Autotune: dude pioneered the use of human voice in instrumentation and rap music and music as a whole WAY before we had travis scotts and young thugs and WAYYY before anybody took autotune seriously. 

2. 808s. same shit just for instrumentation and production, not only in hip hop and trap but as a whole? you know that bass sound in trap? that's an 808. he used those wayy back in 2008 when nobody else did, setting a standard for the tool? 

3. Samples: the way the dude samples on records like College Dropout and Late Registration....it's fucking orgasmic.

Please try to genuinely understand things instead of calling people fanboys. The ignorance of your comment is making me want to vomit."
3302,2020-11-09 15:18:28,jqwql1,and how much kanye have you listened to sir?

3304,2020-11-09 14:45:32,jqwql1,"> his production level is crazy good

Sound engineers and producers are legitimately cringing right now."
3305,2020-11-09 14:50:00,jqwql1,"No, you really can't. Hell, I'll even use an example from your username with Drum N Bass. No one specific person made those jumps from breakbeat hardcore to what we now know as dnb, it was an entire community. For *one* person to be so prolific that they create entire subgenres is extremely rare to the extent that it's only happened a handful of times."
3306,2020-11-09 15:21:00,jqwql1,"yeah because you aren't going too deep into the genre? here's a few great trap records to listen to:

thats like if i said ALL pop music is awful annoying shit. but if you dig deeper than the fucking surface you'd see that."

3308,2020-11-09 15:08:16,jqwql1,Just seems like a petty way for a city to claim something is theirs when all they really want to do is squeeze money out of a situation.
3309,2020-11-09 15:01:25,jqwql1,"You said you don't have to be a genius. Yeah, you do. In the field he's in, how else would he be able to do it?"
3310,2020-11-09 14:13:59,jqwql1,"You‚Äôre the one being snappy about Kanye‚Äôs musical talents, I‚Äôm not a fan but he is talented. Not in the genres I enjoy, but he is.

Michael Jackson was a pop music writer and he basically beat boxed his music before putting them into instruments, I would say he was a musical genius... but oh noes... he does mainstream commercial pop."
3311,2020-11-09 14:17:50,jqwql1,"Oh okay, you‚Äôre legitimately delusional. Have a good one, I‚Äôm not gonna listen to the ramblings of someone psychotic"
3312,2020-11-09 15:07:59,jqwql1,"The whole thing is a bit odd.

I like the fantastic beats portion. I like the grindewald portion. What I don‚Äôt get is how they‚Äôre just smacked together to form what‚Äôs supposed to be a 5 movie series.

As a member of the HP generation I‚Äôm a bit disappointed in what we got for the grindewald story that everyone has been curious about since we heard about his epic fight with dumbledore."

Maybe the hypomanic phase does heighten creativity, but not sleeping and not eating will counteract your energy and heighten anxiety making you feel like you‚Äôre on bad cocaine. The problem with the mania is everything is euphoric even insignificant things that can take on a huge important role in your view of the wold because of delusions. The fake enlightenment is really just as harmful as the depression. I feel so bad for Kanye, he would be truly unstoppable if he could see reality."

I speak very candidly with anyone who asks about bipolar disorder because we honestly just need some fucking compassion. People hear ‚Äúpsychotic‚Äù and immediately think you‚Äôre Michael Myers. It‚Äôs hard to be positive about your future when people get hung up on one word. Keep fighting the good fight üíï you‚Äôre important, strong, and loved."

3336,2020-11-09 15:01:53,jqwql1,"Music is subjective.

The best actual record I have in my collection right now is probably Spor's Anachronic album because it showcases the amount of production quality can go into a genre like dnb.  I do also have the sub focus remix of out of space by the prodigy if that counts."
3337,2020-11-09 15:08:48,jqwql1,I could have agreed on how him being a musical genius is unpopular in terms of the point of view of general public who see a lot of his Asshole persona and not listen to his music but to say he is not one who is crazy good at production was just wrong

3341,2020-11-09 15:10:17,jqwql1,Music is subjective yes but it is a fact with how he influenced hip hop with 808 and heartbreak and some with college dropout as well and how he is crazy good at production. Like the guy said do check out kids see ghost cause it is one of my favourite ep and something different

Bleep bloop I'm a bot.

Your submission was approved u/bleakneon, thank you for posting !

You can know your score at anytime by Direct Messaging me (the bot) with the word ""SCORE"" as a subject."
3357,2020-11-09 17:40:26,jquvzr,"In my opinion, the concept is great, but it lacks power. You should pump up the percussion and the bass, layer it more, you can add some spontaneous synth passages here and there. But in my opinion, it's the drums that will make the biggest difference. Even a mediocre song can sound outstanding if properly mixed with the drums, so I guess there you go :)"
3358,2020-11-09 20:05:22,jquvzr,"Hey! It sounds really good! The composition is nice, there are different elements playing here and there, has a good flow. Some unusual sounds add much to the personal style.

I would only boost a beat a little bit - not to get it louder, but a bit more EQ (adding some more high frequencies builds a nice boost to the snares and hats!) and bit more spacial placing (front/back). But those are details, all the elements are well placed"
3359,2020-11-09 21:15:47,jquvzr,"Hey!

I agree with the others, that the drums are the main issue. The claps/snares are way to low in the mix compared to the kick drum. The piano hook sounds a bit robotic and predictable.

Apart from that it is a solid track. I really like the texture of the track created by the obscure sounds/samples. Keep going!"
3360,2020-11-09 23:00:30,jquvzr,"I like it a lot but it seems very light and chill instead of like dark and powerful. The instruments are dope and I like the riffs. I'm kind of indifferent about the drums, but I think it could use different hi hats at least. Cool beat tho!"
3361,2020-11-10 06:56:21,jquvzr,I think it just sounds a little awkward. Like there‚Äôs no driving force. Placing the down beat and groove point is difficult for the listener. Keep working! You got good instincts to run with.
3362,2020-11-09 09:06:44,jquaga,Sunna funnna hunnah Brittany Murphy. I felt that.

Also, try praying, God is relational. 

.lastly, based on Kanye..... Try KB, Lecrae, and Trip Lee. I too am musical and am more inclined to rap than the worship genre"
3501,2020-12-15 13:45:15,kdkmhz,"Hey brother maybe my testimony can help you.  So key things to remember here.  It is by grace not works that we are saved, even the fact that we are drawn to Jesus is a gracious gift from God.  My experience completely makes that teaching true for me, I did not nor could I ever do anything without Jesus and the Holy Spirit, even my faith!

So I was a hopeless agnostic alcoholic.  I was a drink away from dying.  A voice came down and told me which hospital to go to.  I was brought back to life.  Then He strategically put the right people in my life who led me to sobriety and to hunger for the Word which ended up getting me born again.

Now, I pray that you don't ever have to go to that extreme to ""see it to believe it"" but sense you are questioning and leaning toward the way of Life, I would recommend saying a little prayer for the Holy Spirit to guide you and just open up the bible and start reading.  Jesus is the Word.  Have that special one on one time with Jesus by reading the Word.  All the answers to your questions are in there.  Give it all to God.  Trust him more than anyone.  Love him more than anyone.  Your life will change for the better.  God bless  you brother."

As a species, we're very flawed and we can hallucinate some serious shit.

So, I would suggest you don't base your judgement on the fallible experiences of others."

3539,2020-12-15 16:02:38,kdhg6c,It was on the tracklist for Kanye's new album but who knows with him. It might never be released and Cudi's verse might not even be in.

## **Rule 1**: Take unfunny things, and make them worse.  

Right now, there are three ways for an image to count as necro:

* Making a bad meme worse
* Making a bad ""deep"" image worse
* Making a cringe image worse

Sometimes the post will be in a gray area, where mods can remove it at will.

Additionally, posts that claim to be ""original content"" will be removed. _Do not post ""original content.""_ This sub is not the place for that.

3649,2020-12-14 23:10:33,kd8w5g,"I mean I like the sentiment of this, but  juice was the only one on that list who I think could be considered a king. Not disrespecting the other ones. But none of the others u listed had the numbers he did for the time he did. I think it is so dumb how when someone dies they immediately get called called a goat or a king. Everyone acts like they loved them so much so they have an excuse to cry for attention and it‚Äôs sad."
3650,2020-12-15 00:49:39,kd8w5g,So what was Jay Z?
3651,2020-12-14 23:46:05,kd8w5g,"This is because they take ""misteps"" and somewhere along the line get cornered.

If you wanna spit and wanna flow, then just be aware of what is MEANS to attain the ability to spit and flow.

Examples of good rappers who know how to manage and know the score?

3652,2020-12-15 00:00:06,kd8w5g,yes. they are murdered
3653,2020-12-15 00:07:26,kd8w5g,Why be king? When you can be a god.
3654,2020-12-15 00:41:37,kd8w5g,I think it‚Äôs to do with being talentless hoodlums.
3655,2020-12-15 01:44:49,kd8w5g,"I didn‚Äôt even know who Nipsey was till he died. Kendrick has been the king since TPAB came out and he‚Äôs still alive and well, knock on wood"
3656,2020-12-15 08:01:28,kd8w5g,"Idk about the one king thing, but I definitely think most of the rappers you mentioned were murdered rather than OD‚Äôd or whatever. Especially Mac Miller. And I think the reason the really big ones don‚Äôt die is because they ‚Äúsigned away their soul to the devil‚Äù either figuratively or in some other way. I used to love rap music but once you really start digging deep most the big guys are satanic propagandists or maybe just genuinely satanic people making music but still. Listen to Do What Thou Wilt by Ab-Soul, Till I Collapse by Eminem, New World Order by Flatbush Zombies, Herb Shuttles by The Underachievers, ect. Plenty examples of conspiracy/satanic enlightenment shit in rap music."
3657,2020-12-14 23:13:17,kd8w5g,How is this a bad thing?
3658,2020-12-14 23:45:39,kd8w5g,"Look how Bugs bunny looks at 2pac tho, this mf knew something"
3659,2020-12-15 00:10:24,kd8w5g,Everybody knows Kdot is the king.
3660,2020-12-15 01:07:31,kd8w5g,I guess Eminem is above the kingly demise theory?  He's certainly out of these dead guys leagues.
3661,2020-12-16 05:17:28,kd8w5g,Kdot also raps about Lucy a lot which can be referred to as lucifer
3662,2020-12-15 00:15:08,kd8rrb,This doesn't make any sense whatsoever...
3663,2020-12-15 00:17:01,kd8rrb,"i'm entertained, but I don't get how 7 corny rappers can inherit any crown. 

So from the time pac and big faded off to whom took over, I'd say Jay-Z inherited the commercial crown. Eminem also mercenary'd some wars."
3664,2020-12-15 19:31:31,kd8rrb,But that pic is pac passing it to Kendrick..

3671,2020-12-14 19:20:09,kd3sts,">‚Äúfiller track‚Äù WE GET IT!!! You don‚Äôt like a particular song. 

I don't think everyone dislikes them, but sometimes they clash with the theme, or are just utterly forgettable.

You're free to defend his music, but it's still filler."
3672,2020-12-14 19:23:18,kd3sts,"SSLP, MMLP, TES, Relapse, and MMLP2 all stuck to the overarching theme pretty nicely though. Also even Em himself has alluded that MTBMB could've stuck to the theme better, but couldn't due to sampling issues"
3673,2020-12-14 21:23:40,kd3sts,My issue with this sub is people taking this shit too seriously. I love Em's music but it's not something to get angry about if people don't like certain tracks.
3674,2020-12-14 19:00:19,kd3sts,"The theme isn‚Äôt only due to the title, but all the Hitchcock skits too. How do you have a skit about dying from music and the go into something like Farewell?"
3675,2020-12-14 21:41:06,kd3sts,"What I want to end in this sub, is the stupid ass lyric chains"
3676,2020-12-14 19:01:53,kd3sts,Naw filler track is a thing and em has issues with filler
3677,2020-12-14 20:29:24,kd3sts,"We arent just saying the shit about the theme because of the title, its that on top of the hitchcock skits and the start of the album. And you're right, songs on an album dont HAVE to stick to the theme but if they did the album would be more cohesive which in turn would make it sound better as a whole. And the whole ""Em murdering the beats"" thing doesnt really make sense in the context of theme for the album being that its music to be murdered BY meaning the music is what should be doing the murdering not em murdering the music. And as far as the filler track argument u made, thats not what people mean when that term is used. I, as well as many others, like a lot of filler tracks, but that doesnt mean they arent filler. If they dont add to the theme, if they dont have much of a topic or subject matter, and/or they dont really have a reason to be there other than they sound good sonically and are being used to fluff out an album then its prolly filler"
3678,2020-12-14 20:43:46,kd3sts,"People also don't understand that even with the said ""fillers"" and ""inconsistencies"" MTBMB was super cohesive. Those who make these comments haven't watched a lot of Hitchcock or any until Eminem dropped the album. Murder isn't the only theme Hitchcock stuck to. His movies revolved around other motifs of dysfunctional relationships, parents, sex and even trains (little engine makes sense?) which Eminem incorporated in the album"
3679,2020-12-14 20:12:13,kd3sts,"Honestly I don't really mind if he sticks with he theme or doesn't, he could literally make a song shredding darts into his mic and I'd still dkwmlaode and bump it ü§£

But I definitely do think he'll stick with he theme more this time round bc of the Alfred outro saying ""if you haven't been murdered, better luck next time""
It'll be like Relapse 2 if he sticks with the theme which it pretty cool to think about"
3680,2020-12-14 20:30:38,kd3sts,"I get what you're saying about the title but keep in mind that the title is an Alfred Hitchcock reference. I think it's more than fair to say that if you have a title, cover, and skits all related to a specific theme/concept, then the music should follow suit. I don't mind that not every song on the album is about death, but the relationship songs for instance feel very out of place. It's not a matter of not liking them, they hurt the flow of the album. Putting Those Kinda Nights after the Alfred Interlude is such a bizarre and jarring choice that I think it's well deserving of criticism. This might not bother you, but I don't understand calling out people for having pretty understandable critiques."
3681,2020-12-15 05:41:41,kd3sts,"Huge W! Agreed with everything you said here!

And I wish I had 'Gold' to give you lol."
3682,2020-12-14 19:03:44,kd3sts,Do you not understand how themes and consistency issues work? Because you obviously don‚Äôt.
3683,2020-12-14 21:35:44,kd3sts,[deleted]
3684,2020-12-14 22:42:19,kd3sts,"Frankly i thought it was well put together and cohesive most of the way through. Besides, most listeners don't stream the album in order anyway, they just stream individual songs they like, or add em to playlists."
3685,2020-12-15 00:58:39,kd3sts,The cohesive theme helps one enjoy and contemplate the art in a deeper level
3686,2020-12-15 01:30:12,kd3sts,"Filler track doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a bad song. It just means it‚Äôs an unnecessary song that doesn‚Äôt fit in well. For example, I like Humble or DNA by Kendrick, but they would sound like huge filler on the TPAB album. I would like them, but I would also think they‚Äôre unnecessary. 


Also, the title is supposed to give you a hint at what the album is supposed to be like. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is a perfect album name for Kanye. Rodeo is a perfect album name for Travis. Acid Rap is a perfect album name for Chance. I like MTBMB, but it doesn‚Äôt stick to the theme well. The cover, title, and skits set this up to be a more darker and horror core album, similar to Relapse. But instead we got tracks like Stepdad, Those Kinda Nights, and a few more that don‚Äôt exactly fit in with the album. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether you like those songs or not, they just don‚Äôt fit on an album called Music To Be Murdered By."
3687,2020-12-15 08:02:26,kd3sts,"I like Stepdad, it‚Äôs catchy as fuck. There, sue me."
3688,2020-12-14 21:46:57,kd3sts,">I just don‚Äôt understand why people project what they interpret a theme to be onto someone‚Äôs art. 

You just described all art ever. People will always have their own interpretation on shit and to ask people to stop having opinions is straight up dumb 

>FFS this is toxic and unnecessary.

Just because you don't agree with a criticism, it doesn't make it toxic, lol what a weird take."
3689,2020-12-14 19:42:13,kd3sts,i would rather an album full of fillers than a smaller tracklist with just the best songs. any eminem song is better than no eminem song.
3690,2020-12-14 21:30:05,kd3sts,"Yes exactly, it doesn‚Äôt mean the song is bad, its just missplaced or doesn‚Äôt fit altogether with what‚Äôs around it, nothing serious at the end od the day"
3691,2020-12-14 19:28:08,kd3sts,He said he had it even more intertwined but couldn‚Äôt get the samples cleared in time. That doesn‚Äôt mean it was off to begin with.
3692,2020-12-14 20:23:32,kd3sts,Whats even worse is that the skit actually goes into Those Kinda Nights
3693,2020-12-14 22:33:10,kd3sts,Forreal. Makes me cringe everything
3694,2020-12-14 22:42:37,kd3sts,Amen

3697,2020-12-14 19:03:41,kd3sts,It‚Äôs not a thing. Just skip the song cause you don‚Äôt like it
3698,2020-12-15 01:23:07,kd3sts,Just watching ‚ÄòPremonition‚Äô on Alfred Hitchcock Presents adds so much context to the album.
3699,2020-12-14 21:03:29,kd3sts,"I disagree, but I get your take. I think being inspired by something and using it well is exactly what he did. The interlude was lean back and enjoy yourself until the coroner comes followed by TKN which is arguably an enjoyable club song works. 

Also bizarre is in that song so perfect phrasing btw."
3700,2020-12-14 19:08:12,kd3sts,I understand that music is art and it doesn‚Äôt have to do or be anything. That‚Äôs the point.
3701,2020-12-14 21:52:55,kd3sts,">I don't see how their existence takes away rom other songs.

3784,2020-12-30 16:00:28,kn2pmm,I remember watching this in my dorm freshman year of college. It‚Äôs such an entertaining interview. It feels like a bridge to a lot of what Kanye started doing with the Yeezy brand.

3788,2020-12-30 17:02:38,kn2pmm,Love the second long snippet of this clip Jean Dawson uses on Pyrotechnics. IDK why but I woke up with this stuck in my head of all things and I was shocked to see it here.
3789,2020-12-30 15:11:46,kn2pmm,Kanye tends to do most things he puts his mind to. And most of his interviews make more sense around 5 years later.
3790,2020-12-30 16:41:16,kn2pmm,Still haven't heard of sways clothing brand
3791,2020-12-30 16:53:31,kn2pmm,This was the moment I started hating Kanye. No one berates Sway
3792,2020-12-30 15:13:21,kn2pmm,"Lol Kanye don't make any sense here. He needs someone else to finance him? Sway asks him, why can't you do it yourself, and Kanye says he can lose money bc he doesn't have the knowledge. Losing $13m isn't much when you're wanting billions. And why should anyone finance him if he doesn't have the knowledge and is too scared to put his own skin in the game?"

3801,2020-12-30 15:22:49,kn2pmm,nothing he said was wrong or disrespectful.

3807,2020-12-30 17:31:07,kn2pmm,"The most annoying part for me is that Sway makes unbreakable eye contact with Kanye that entire sequence and Kanye won't look at him.

Like man, you wanna go off on him and act like your opinion is important but can't even look the man in the eye while you're making your point."

3813,2020-12-30 20:18:10,kn2pmm,"I don't know about that. Kanye loves announcing shit that he has no intention of following through on. His video game, his cartoon, his how many unreleased albums. The man can't follow through."

3818,2020-12-30 16:27:39,kn2pmm,"Actually he makes plenty of sense. The only way to have a means of distribution and production widespread enough is to be funded by a larger organization because they own the factories. Kanye himself could never raise enough to elicit the type of distribution he would need to be a name brand, despite having the potential projections to do so. 

He was, and still is, in a race against time to achieve all of his goals while he still has his biggest bargaining chip which is being ‚ÄúKanye West‚Äù."

3827,2020-12-30 16:25:54,kn2pmm,The way he was acting and refusing to even look in Sway's direction at all is extremely disrespectful. Shows his mental instability.

from Kanye, there's ""'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke"" from Saint Pablo.

You gave him twenty million without blinkin'

3849,2020-12-30 18:21:16,kn2pmm,"Something I noticed in the letterman interview, when he was talking about his mom, growing up, and his past, he was really personal and looked at Dave directly and was generally very warm. It felt very human and normal. The second Dave brought up trump he started looking at the audience like he was making some sort of grand statement about the world and politics. It was weird like the second he needs to project something, namely something he‚Äôs facing pushback on, he shifts his body language away from the interviewer but when it‚Äôs about his experiences he‚Äôs more conversational. Happens here too about the fashion industry that he had been boxed out of at the time"
3850,2020-12-30 18:13:08,kn2pmm,"Yeah, I get that there‚Äôs definitely a lot of mental illness in there, and he was probably frustrated that whatever point he was trying to make wasn‚Äôt hitting, but it‚Äôs just a personal pet peeve of mine when people are going off but they‚Äôre looking at someone else/something else. It‚Äôs like motherfucker, don‚Äôt yell at me and say the shit you‚Äôre saying while also not saying it to me. 

It wasn‚Äôt even a tense environment until Kanye made it tense anyways."

3853,2020-12-30 20:12:28,kn2pmm,I agree. Ignore the haters
3854,2020-12-30 22:27:58,kn2pmm,Agreed but just because of my love for it's industrial sound.
3855,2020-12-30 18:37:24,kn2pmm,Lmao not by a mile
3856,2020-12-30 19:56:43,kn2pmm,Reddit moment right here
3857,2020-12-30 23:03:26,kn2pmm,"It's definitely my favorite, but best is debatable"
3858,2020-12-30 19:19:36,kn2pmm,It's a no from me dawg.
3859,2020-12-30 22:58:23,kn2pmm,"Yeezus is definetely New Kanye. New Kanye doesn't mean when he went from good to shit, it's when he stopped the classic stuff around MBDTF/WTT and started going super experimental/fashion focus and eventually sorta safe with the Christian albums."
3860,2020-12-31 00:42:45,kn2pmm,"I mean yeah before College Dropout, I'm sure people were telling Kanye to give up all the time. That's the story of like every famous person. And the Yeezy brand is a huge success I'll give him that. But, to act like Kanye follows through on most things is just wrong. There are like 7 different announced albums that haven't come out. How many times has he said an album's coming out this Friday and that hasn't' happened? Kanye has a huge ego that makes him think he can do anything when in reality he should just stick to what he's good at."
3861,2020-12-31 22:35:53,kn2pmm,"Wow you're unintelligent. Not only did you have the audacity to try and correct me, but you did it with wrong information. Yes, that's true in many markets these companies do contract out the work. BUT they can negotiate better terms because of volume and scale. The cost of production that Adidas has VS an individual entity like Kanye is an astronomical difference. 

But I'm assuming you're someone that has never even attempted to manufacture something in mass and are just speaking out of your fucking ass. As someone who HAS manufactured products en masse, you are in direct competition with corporations OVER those factories and so your rates are too high for your costs to make sense. In order to recoupe that cost you need to sell your products at a premium which Kanye did NOT want to do ""numbnuts"". He wanted his products to be accessible and affordable."
3862,2020-12-30 17:24:05,kn2pmm,"Huh?? 

Nobody gives a fuck about your clothes if no one can see them or buy them. You need distribution to move your products. That‚Äôs business 101."
3863,2020-12-30 17:49:29,kn2pmm,"What are you even talking about, man? Pictures of clothes don't do shit if you want to be a brand. You need distribution to actually make and send shoes around the world to sell. Without distribution, kanye is just 1 pair of shoes at his house"
3864,2020-12-30 20:01:19,kn2pmm,He‚Äôs not just trying to create clothes. He‚Äôs trying to make a clothing brand.
3865,2020-12-30 18:25:22,kn2pmm,What doesn't make sense. He says he doesn't have the money for what he wants to do and needs investors. What's so hard to understand about that?

3872,2020-12-31 22:37:47,kn2pmm,"Nice paragraph of entirely a strawman. Nike and Adidas don‚Äôt own the factories where their items are produced. That‚Äôs a simple, undeniable fact, no amount of you straw-Manning will change that. You are really fucking dumb. Just learn to read."
3873,2020-12-30 17:25:03,kn2pmm,"He's screaming artist, not businessman. Art doesn't need distribution"
3874,2020-12-30 17:59:17,kn2pmm,That's art. Art doesn't need distribution. Making money needs distribution
3875,2020-12-30 22:26:17,kn2pmm,Capitalism without capital.
3876,2020-12-30 17:17:02,kn2pmm,dude you'd be surprised but a lot of it actually has even the hologram lol
3877,2020-12-30 17:27:39,kn2pmm,He has done a surprising amount of the things on this list already. And he‚Äôs not even close to finish. He‚Äôs in his 40s.
3878,2020-12-30 17:26:05,kn2pmm,There‚Äôs nothing wrong with calling yourself the best. If his being proud of himself offends you I think that speaks volumes about who you are more than it does him.
3879,2020-12-31 22:40:39,kn2pmm,They do own the factories because they control what those factories produce and anyone attempting to also utilize said factories competes with these corporations at rates they cannot possibly afford. Nothing of what you just said addressed anything of which I just disproved you with. Talk about a strawman.
3880,2020-12-30 17:29:25,kn2pmm,Do you know what record labels do?
3881,2020-12-30 17:57:13,kn2pmm,"So fast forward to 2020, Kanye was right and is now a billionaire. Just sayin."
3882,2020-12-30 17:27:37,kn2pmm,Oh jesus
3883,2020-12-30 18:03:27,kn2pmm,oh baby what is you doing
3884,2020-12-30 17:30:26,kn2pmm,You still have time to delete this comment before more people see it and rip you to fucking shreds
3885,2020-12-30 18:32:44,kn2pmm,"You my friend, are a dumbass. If the art requires multiple people to see it for the experience, then it needs distribution. Video games are art, but theyre interactive modes of art and require people to play them to be experienced, and for people to experience them you need to DISTRIBUTE it to those people (yes, even if it's given out for free and no money is made). Books are art, but they're interactive and need to be read to be experienced. In order to read a book, one needs to be DISTRIBUTED to you. Music is art, but in order to experience it, the song has to be DISTRIBUTED to you. Even posting a picture online is distribution. Have you ever in your life worked in anything related to the art world or do you just like making up opinions in your free time?"
3886,2020-12-30 18:21:33,kn2pmm,People still stan ye like this in 2020? gross lol
3887,2020-12-30 17:36:08,kn2pmm,This video is more than ‚Äòbeing proud of himself‚Äô it‚Äôs him imposing his superiority complex on someone in an unpleasant way. You can explain why you‚Äôre proud of your accomplishments without demeaning others like he is here.
3888,2020-12-31 22:42:22,kn2pmm,"No, by definition they don't own the factories. If you don't understand the difference then you really are a dumb fuck. You realize literally all Ive said is that they don't own the factories- which they don't. I have not even said a single other thing. Keep tryign to do mental gymnastics. They don't own the factories. Get that through your thick fucking skull. I never made an argument about whether Kanye could feasibly do the same by himself. Learn to read you imbecile."
3889,2020-12-30 17:39:42,kn2pmm,"He has this level of distribution. He's got record label deals.

Also you're talking about the business of art. He's just screaming about wanting to be able to create good art. 

Banksy creates great art without distribution. If he wants to make money that's fine, but then it's just different than talking about wanting to be an artist. He wants to be a business man then."
3890,2020-12-30 17:39:47,kn2pmm,That's ok
3891,2020-12-30 18:49:25,kn2pmm,"dude dont bother with guy, some people are and always will be daft as fuck."
3892,2020-12-30 21:47:37,kn2pmm,LOL this is exactly how the convo Sway and Kanye have in this interview goes
3893,2020-12-30 18:40:17,kn2pmm,"Banksy.

Yes I mean paid distribution that requires the shitloads of money he's asking for. He can get free distribution via the Internet like you said."
3894,2020-12-31 22:44:04,kn2pmm,You're arguing semantics of words instead of the actual argument. You're an idiot. Not going to argue with someone who hasn't even done what they are arguing for. Peace.
3895,2020-12-30 17:42:09,kn2pmm,"Record labels do not distribute clothing. Do you know how much money and resources it takes to produce and distribute a clothing brand on a global or even national scale? 

He didn‚Äôt want to be Kanyewest.com he wanted to be Louis Vuitton. And with the help of Adidas who gave him the distribution channels and infrastructure he needed, now he is."
3896,2020-12-30 18:47:42,kn2pmm,"Okay #1. ""Banksy"" is not some end-all-be-all counter argument to this. You know why we even know about him? Because other people distribute his work to us when they find it on walls. Also....just no. Banksy is about the most specific and ""not-like-how-the-ENTIRE-rest-of-the-art-world-works"" example you could have possibly found. That's like, a super-strawman. 

And then why did you never say that in your other comments? ANYWAYS that point is wrong too. How do you suggest I send you a handbag over the internet? Art that's meant for an audience requires an audience and different art mediums require different money investments to start out, and high end fashion is like, one of the top 3 most expensive ones. That's why we don't see an abundance of soundcloud IMAX filmmakers like we do rappers. Because some art actually requires money to get off the ground....I can't actually believe I have to explain this concept"
3897,2020-12-31 22:45:43,kn2pmm,"You realize I'm not the same person arguing in the rest of the thread, right. I simply pointed out a factual error you made and you decided to have a fucking breakdown. Learn to read. Learn to read. Learn to read. (That should make it easier for you). Nike does not own factories. It's very simple. No amount of you crying and name calling will change that. Take a deep breath you little fucking dork. You‚Äôre one of those kids who was bullied for being ugly AND stupid, huh?"
3898,2020-12-30 17:46:44,kn2pmm,"He needs to just create one piece of clothing design to create great art. Producing and distributing clothing is beyond just creating art. That's just about $$

Also, it's hypocritical of him to cry about being slaves when he attaches himself to these large distributors and existing infrastructure, ie the very entities that are creating these ""new slaves"". He's just becoming part of the system he's railing about. 

If it's all about $ that's ok but he's always framing it like he's in it purely for creativity and artistry."
3899,2020-12-30 19:36:22,kn2pmm,"High end fashion doesn't need to be distributed to be art. It needs to be distributed to make money. 

Tons of designers can make one article and have it on the runway shows, and it's still art, regardless of who buys it or wears it. 

Banksy is an example of an artist that makes art that doesn't require lots of investment money. The distribution part stands, he gets views from the internet, which you can also do with clothing design. I don't think you know what strawman means bc I'm not using banksy as an example to attack it."
3900,2020-12-30 17:49:39,kn2pmm,"Kanye doesn‚Äôt want to just create art. He wants to create art that reaches people and changes the world. You cannot change fashion by creating clothes in your bedroom for no one to see or wear. 

Fashion is a business. Art is a business. Kanye is not a hobbyist. You‚Äôre arguing a point he never made."
3901,2020-12-30 20:01:18,kn2pmm,"But art that's purpose is to be interactive isnt doing what it's supposed to do if no one interacts with it. If how you consume the art is by listening, wearing, reading, looking at, or playing it and no one can, it's not complete. You can't actually argue that the audience consuming the art is actually not part of what makes it art in the first place. The art of a movie is how it moves audiences, but if no one sees it, then it's not acting as a piece of art. Cooking food can be art, but if it's made and then thrown away, it's not doing it's job as art. And yes banksy requires money because it was someone else investing in art media to report his work to the masses and say it's good enough to pay attention to. We don't know about banksy just because we all happened to stumble on one of his drawings in London personally. Online distribution is still distribution and a ton of money was put into us seeing it, even if it wasn't done personally by him. Anything that is famous in entertainment requires mass, money-driven distribution for us to even be aware of it. Of course I'm not saying that if you make something, it's not art until you give it to someone else, but if part of the art Is how it moves people that experience it, actually having people experience it is vital to its value as art"
3902,2020-12-30 18:00:48,kn2pmm,"The point he's made is about art and creativity above all else. If he wants to be a businessman that's fine.

And again, if it is about the art, banksy does the reaching shit and changing the world without distribution. Kanye just wants to make $"
3903,2020-12-30 18:04:10,kn2pmm,You have a very naive view of how the world works. Go up to a random person and ask them if they know who the fuck Banksy is. Ask that same person if they know what Yeezys are.
3904,2020-12-30 18:06:13,kn2pmm,".... Then it's not about art and creativity then. Popularity and sales =/= art, which again is fine if he wasn't talking art and creativity constantly. 

And what about the hypocrisy of talking new slaves when he's feeding into the same slave system he's railing against"
3905,2020-12-30 19:14:13,kn2pmm,"You dumb muthafucka...

Sometimes making something that's able to be mass produced is an art form in its own right. 

Think about the difficulty of making a sculpture of a shoe that just sits behind a piece of glass- it doesn't have to fit anybody's foot; it doesn't have to actually feel comfortable. And compare that with making an actually functional shoe, and figuring out how to mass produce it and ship it around the globe.

There's no rules saying that art exists purely in a box and it can't be mixed with anything outside that boundary. Art can be combined with business, engineering, philosophy, science, etc. The fact that you think art it one single unalterable concept is so egregious that  it directly contradicts your own statements about art and it shows that you clearly don't understand it any deeper than its definition in a textbook.

What if the canvas Kanye wants to paint on is the population of the world instead of a singular finite rectangle? Imagine designing and implementing and art piece that is designed to use a collective group of millions of people as a mannequin. I see it as a conceptual art piece, and that singular perspective is just as valid as any traditional interpretation of art."
3906,2020-12-30 19:38:37,kn2pmm,"I mean that definitely can be art, except it feels like you made this up to rationalize Kanye's actions, like working backwards to justify what he's done. Bc your definition is antithetical to what Kanye preaches about new slaves and consumerism"
3907,2020-12-30 20:02:10,kn2pmm,"All of his shoes have a reasonable retail price and the artificially low supply is mostly a choice by Adidas. He's stated his goals for the Yeezy brand a lot and his overaching message is to take high-art inspired designs and make them available to the general public. That was his mission behind his shoes, his clothes, and his real estate idea Yeezy Home. 

The argument I posed isn't immediately apparent from reading Kanye news, but there's been a pretty consistent message about his goals with the brand in his interviews from 2015 to 2018. The interview with Charlemagne is probably the most clear and coherent he's been about it, and he explains some of his ideas about Yeezy Homes. I'm not saying it all makes sense or that they're all great ideas, but his overall intentions behind mass producing his art are an artistic choice first and the business side is secondary. A lot of his choices with his manufacturing processes don't make sense from a mindset of maximizing profit, and because of that I feel like my perception of the brand is at least somewhat valid."

3947,2020-12-30 08:18:27,kmv3wn,No art exists in a vacuum.  Everyone is influenced by and inspired by existing things.  Whatever Kanye is taking from took those ideas from somewhere else.

I may have phrased it wrong. What I really meant was people today are being called out for ‚Äúcultural appropriation‚Äù or stealing the styles of rappers/celebrities that are black. That‚Äôs the problem I am addressing, because a lot of people (like me a couple months ago) don‚Äôt know about the whole stealing like an artist thing and that people have been doing it since the dawn of time. So when we do it now a days and get called out for stealing a style or being influenced , it‚Äôs frustrating because that is the norm, but people today don‚Äôt view it that way and usually give credit to the rappers/celebs that popularized a style and stole it from someone else.

If there is anymore confusion, please let me know"

3954,2020-12-30 03:26:05,kmtxe3," I collected all the leaks this year. The idea is that everyone who could not catch these leaks, has access to it now.

I'm posting now, because I don't think there will be any more leaks this year.

Some points:

1 - Jack √ú stems were leaked in March and inside the folders they had instruments wav, we only had the instruments mp3 320, I think few people noticed that.

2 - I put the track ""On Ice"", leaked in 2018, but that this sub got to know that Skrillex worked on it this year, I believe that some people didn‚Äôt get it, so I put it in the folder.

3 - In March of this year, Skrillex sets were leaked in 2014 in high quality, the Levels VIP + Cinema that Skrillex played in these sets was a little different from the versions leaked in 2016. Then, they cleaned up the audio and posted the two versions of these tracks. Enjoy! SKRILLEX SETS LEAK: https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/1RaTNlosfOHjVcX_8aC6cGS1n2MP_ehfg

4 - Ego Death and Temptations were leaked at the beginning of the year and are slightly different from the released versions, basically a Pre-release.

I want to thank all the people who leaked these songs, it was a year that everyone was waiting for the release of the album, but that didn't happen, taking these tracks made me a little happier.

Obs: If you want to download all the tracks at once, the last link is a RAR with all the tracks inside."

I know people think of nutrition and physical training improving in the future but I think the next big step for future nba players is learning the ‚Äúchess‚Äù aspect of the NBA. How to get deep into film, dissect not only your own game but that of those around you etc. I really don‚Äôt think most NBA players learn how to get deep into film sessions until late in their careers unless those players are surrounded by great vets for years. 

Part of what makes a player like Rondo and LeBron able to ‚Äúcoast‚Äù throughout a season is because guys like that can already do what is required of them to be successful on the court and what‚Äôs left for them year to year is breaking down film. I mean that‚Äôs what the playoffs are all about. Sure they spend off seasons refining some on the court skills but I imagine at later stages in their career they focus on their health and just getting to the playoffs."
4048,2020-12-30 00:52:24,kmr32a,"What makes LeBron particularly unique is that, at any moment on the court, he is probably both the most athletic guy and also the smartest guy. That is just rare; usually the most cerebral guy in any sport isn‚Äôt *also* their sport‚Äôs best athlete. LeBron is. 

And he‚Äôs had to do so much to get into the GOAT argument. It‚Äôs a dozen and a half seasons of dominance, and counting. 

It‚Äôs going to take a hell of a lot. Takes a lot for someone to even sniff the all-time top 5."
4049,2020-12-30 01:38:07,kmr32a,"It sounds trite, but usually there are generational athletes every generation. Have to have mix of physical gifts, work ethic, proper professional situations, avoid injuries, etc. There won't be another quite like Lebron, but there will almost certainly be someone who ends up standing head and shoulders above their peers. We should try to enjoy them while they play, sometimes people spend so much time hating it blinds them to the greatness (happened with Jordan, Kobe, Bron, etc)."
4050,2020-12-30 01:12:39,kmr32a,LeBron ever put up 37 in Game 6 of the ECF against the Celtics? No he hasn‚Äôt and that‚Äôs why Herro will be better

My dad said in the 80's when they used to play fantasy hockey the league would either exclude Gretzky entirely, or have one ""player"" that was Gretzky's goals, and one ""player"" that was Gretzky's assists.

Can you imagine the basketball equivalent of that?! It would be absolutely insane. LeBron definitely has a case as the greatest ever, but he's never been more than like 10% better than the next best player in the league."

4073,2020-12-30 03:12:17,kmr32a,"Here's the fun thing about GOATness:

It doesn't respect age necessarily.

Kareem stepped onto the NBA court as the best player in the league.  He would have been the best player in the league if he had skipped college entirely. The only guy who could touch him was Wilt, but Wilt wasn't much of a winner.

MJ was almost universally accepted as GOAT after his 2nd championship and he never lost the title.

Best offensive player in league history. Best defensive player at his position ever. Doesn't necessarily have to go undefeated in finals series, but better be the MVP every time they win.

That's the bar.  The only way to reach higher than that is to be what he was, but win more titles, and sooner. Basically, it'd have to be someone who would go to a team with a solid roster due to some trade fluke like an unprotected pick and elevate them to titles almost immediately.

To illustrate my point: right now most folks would pick Brady as the GOAT QB in the NFL.  Should Pat Mahomes play his next 5-6 years like he's played his last 3, and win 3-4 more titles during that span, Brady will be getting inducted to the Pro Football HOF as the former GOAT. Greatness and immediate success > lesser output and longer term success."
4074,2020-12-30 02:14:35,kmr32a,"It's an interesting conversation. Luka seems like an evolution of both Lebron and Harden in many ways. It will be interesting and exciting to see how his career plays out. 

There are also guys like Jokic who aren't elite athletes, but are just so uniquely talented that they break the game of basketball and shape it into something that better suits them. Jokic plays even better in the playoffs because the game slows down and a half court offense lets him just plant his 7 foot frame in the paint and feed teammates.

There is also the rings argument. Lebron has many rings, but he has been flat outplayed many times in the finals as well. Jordan never was. And there may be other future athletes that don't have the physical gifts that Lebron does, but have an even stronger winner's mindset.

One thing I think many casual fans kinda right is that as much of a boss Lebron is, he does have his moments of mental weakness that Kobe and Jordan never really showed. 

I just don't think that there's only one way to win."
4075,2020-12-30 02:16:21,kmr32a,"As someone that team hops and absolutely needs 2 imported superstars per team to win a trophy, I‚Äôd have to say that as soon as someone can stay put and win titles with drafted teammates and role players, like GS did pre KD. ‚ÄúAdonal Foyle is not walking through that door!‚Äù Kidding lol. 

I say that as somebody that absolutely loves LBJs game. That doesn‚Äôt make him the GOAT lol. He‚Äôs a generational player, a legendary player, and definitely top 3 of all time, but if someone comes along and wins without pulling half the leagues allstars to his teams to win, is when we will have that ‚Äúbetter‚Äù debate. 

I understand that‚Äôs the nature of today‚Äôs NBA, so I can‚Äôt 100% fault him for it, but you can‚Äôt call someone a GOAT when they need other top 5 superstars to and team go and in a league that doesn‚Äôt encourage any type of perimeter defense. 

I mean, I love Harden, even as mercurial as he is, but if he goes to Brooklyn or any other ‚Äúsuper team‚Äù, I‚Äôll say the same shit. That‚Äôs what was great about Golden State, they built that squad through the draft, but imported KD and blew the league away. They took a hit, as did KD, when he signed. They became the villains of the NBA for a minute. 

Cheesy and cheap, but hey, that‚Äôs today‚Äôs NBA.

Edit: All you EA and NBA2K fan kids don‚Äôt need to reply. I get why y‚Äôall love him, he‚Äôs your Jordan and he‚Äôs fun to play with on PS4.

4080,2020-12-30 07:26:09,kmr32a,Great post. I think the only way you could really say someone is better than Lebron is if there was an even taller Lebron. Like a giannis with great court vision and passing ability
4081,2020-12-30 07:40:16,kmr32a,"I disagree with your premise. Basketball greatness isn't defined as some mix of physical/mental traits. People like to argue things like ""Player X is better because he's 10% better at shooting while being 2% better at passing and only 4% worse at defense. Add those up and he's 8% better"". But the reality is that basketball doesn't work like that. 

LeBron isn't great because he's hyperathletic, or hyperathletic and smart at the same time. He's great because he wins basketball games against the other players of his era.

It's entirely possible that Giannis figures out how to win and has a Jordan-esque run. Or Luka. Or Zion. Or another player. 

It's hard to know, but the next player that will win 4+ championships and 3+ FMVPs is almost certainly already in the league."
4082,2020-12-30 14:45:00,kmr32a,"Yeah, that actually makes sense. Players like steph, shaq, mj are the best at something (shooting, rim dominance, winning). 
Lebron is great at everything, but not the best at any one thing. He's like the most versatile player."
4083,2020-12-30 15:17:14,kmr32a,Kanye West is a musical genius? Eh..
4084,2020-12-30 15:59:44,kmr32a,"Easy (not really). Someone that is 95% as good as LeBron but gets drafted into a Spurs type organization rather than Cleveland. Like say KD if they hadn't have traded Harden to avoid the luxury tax. KD isn't quite as good as Bron, but say he goes 5-0 with the Thunder we probably see them as the same right?

KD and Giannis are the best mold of players in terms of size and athleticism. Giannis doesn't have the shot and KD just hasn't quite had the right luck and teams to amass the stats he would need to be a challenger, but I think the next possible contender to that status fits that mold."
4085,2020-12-31 01:25:54,kmr32a,"Healthy zion Williams?

Hes a physical beast, a better shooter, and seems to be very wholesome & smart about his public image which I hope means hell be a good leader.

4088,2020-12-30 01:28:47,kmr32a,"Other factors to be considered GOAT are championship rings.

So realistically, we could have someone equally as good as Lebron but started off with a good team (so more rings) and he would be considered the GOAT"
4089,2020-12-30 00:48:33,kmr32a,Lebron is not better than MJ.  Basketball is a game of skill not just physicality.  Mj was the more complete basketball player whereas LBJ was more complete as an athlete.
4090,2020-12-30 00:48:37,kmr32a,Very cringy.

4092,2020-12-30 01:09:41,kmr32a,Well there needs to be someone better than current LeBron first.
4093,2020-12-30 04:05:25,kmr32a,"> Like what would a better version of LeBron even be?

IMO the most physically gifted player I've ever seen in the NBA was Shaq. I think Shaq would have unquestionably been considered the GOAT if he had the same drive that guys like Jordan and LeBron have. Jordan was nearly psychotic about what he would do to win, and LeBron puts every ounce he can into maximizing what he can do (i.e. hyperbaric chambers, cryogenics, spending over $1 million a year on his body, etc). Shaq rarely took very good care of himself and would often show up to camp out of shape and just use the season to work himself into shape.

I've always been convinced that when you're as physically gifted as Shaq, to where in college he was getting quadruple teamed and it didn't matter, and in the pros nobody could stop him either, it was probably hard to have it inside himself to push himself to his limit. Why bother when he'd almost surely been able to utterly dominate everyone forever? A big part of what made Michael Jordan who he was was probably him being cut from the team in HS cause he wasn't good enough. I doubt Shaq ever had anything like that happen to him.

Shaq was a fairly lazy player throughout his career, but even still he's a top 10-15 player all time. As good as he was he really only deserved 1 or maybe 2 MVP awards and he never led the league in either rebounding or blocks (while guys like Chris Webber an Shawn Bradley did). So my answer for what a ""better version of LeBron"" would look like is if we get someone else with a physique and athleticism like Shaq but with more motivation and drive and work ethic like Jordan or LeBron."
4094,2020-12-30 00:53:40,kmr32a,"I honestly don‚Äôt get the whole mentality thing. The guy has more buzzer playoff game winners than Jordan, kobe, Durant and Curry COMBINED"
4095,2020-12-30 02:27:49,kmr32a,"Her plays in a no contact league catered to his success. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, he‚Äôs a great player, but he couldn‚Äôt handle the physicality so it‚Äôs progressively gotten softer throughout his career. He‚Äôs not close to peak Mike."

I don‚Äôt know why OP assumes that something has to be categorically different about a new player for them to be better than LeBron. Luka‚Äôs stats in his first two years have been very similar to LeBron‚Äôs first two years. If that continues and Luka has a very similar career trajectory to LeBron, but he happens to have a better team around him and wins 2 more rings or something, would that be enough? If Luka matches MVPs of LeBron but goes 7-2 in the finals, or something similar, I think that‚Äôs put him in GOAT contention even if he‚Äôs not ‚Äúbetter‚Äù at any individual part of the game. 

I guess I‚Äôm just saying that basketball is a team sport, so someone on a similar level to LeBron (still a once in a generation talent) could look a lot better in the GOAT debate if they happen to have a better team built around them"

Him being that way, the physical freak of nature he is, doesn't require him to be that relentless assassin that would strike over and over again. He isn't as lazy as what us normal average people think. The lazy standard between us and a professional basketball superstar is different. He still works hard for sure because he wouldn't have the skills he possesses if he didn't. It's just that he did have that ""extra"" drive to be able to overcome history. To be able to compete with history itself. And if ever he has that, who knows if his body can take that ""extra"" toll as well.

4141,2020-12-30 02:53:16,kmr32a,That‚Äôd do it.
4142,2021-01-01 00:18:52,kmr32a,"He'd be close to Lebron currently with average shooting, but Peak Lebron would still be in a tier of his own compared to current players + supergiannis"
4143,2020-12-30 01:05:46,kmr32a,Boban.
4144,2020-12-30 01:15:40,kmr32a,Good point
4145,2020-12-30 17:34:52,kmr32a,"He didn‚Äôt say that lebron was the sure fire goat. He said he thinks he is. Either way, lebron is first or second and that doesn‚Äôt take away from the point of the post."
4146,2020-12-30 09:42:37,kmr32a,Kobe was closer in age to LeBron than he was to Shaq. What we define as a generation is pretty arbitrary.
4147,2020-12-31 21:35:16,kmr32a,Lol this. He‚Äôs got really high IQ. I‚Äôd say if he was as good at passing and facilitating he‚Äôd have a pretty strong case for it
4148,2020-12-30 06:23:12,kmr32a,Lol no
4149,2020-12-30 20:34:28,kmr32a,Luka hasn‚Äôt shown close to enough on defense to look like someone who will eventually be in the GOAT conversation. Amazing player but he needs to develop on that side of the ball a lot to be on that level.
4150,2020-12-30 00:55:52,kmr32a,Y‚Äôall really never watched jordan huh
4151,2020-12-30 01:28:45,kmr32a,Semantics but I'd say that LeBron is the best while mj is the greatest.
4152,2020-12-30 06:42:01,kmr32a,Lakers fan lmfao
4153,2020-12-30 00:53:15,kmr32a,Uh huh

4155,2020-12-30 20:40:25,kmr32a,"He‚Äôs never reacted well to physical things against him. Hence the flopping and continuous crying. He cries in video games. Again, I do believe he‚Äôs one of the most talented players ever, but best, nope."
4156,2020-12-30 04:11:02,kmr32a,"He handled it, but they changed the rules to make sure he could. He‚Äôs a great person, a great basketball player, but definitely not the best ever. Happy holidays. Endless debate."
4157,2020-12-31 01:46:02,kmr32a,Yeah I im not sure he'll catch up in rings but that wouldn't surprise me since he's on the Lakers and has a top level player like AD beside him and likely they will constantly upgrade the team.
4158,2020-12-30 05:02:03,kmr32a,"Love DH but he‚Äôs not an All-Star in 2 major professional sports. 

When I was a kid I thought we‚Äôd start seeing guys like Bo and Deion all the time. I‚Äôm still waiting."
4159,2020-12-30 06:47:14,kmr32a,Adrian Peterson that is all
4160,2020-12-30 05:00:27,kmr32a,But could he also hit a baseball 450 feet?
4161,2020-12-30 11:41:06,kmr32a,"Exactly. With Lebron it‚Äôs everything: dictating pace, accurate passes, seeing plays before they happen, jumping in front and getting steals and blocks. 

Just being a great passer doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you have the best BBIQ"
4162,2020-12-30 02:38:39,kmr32a,Man raises a good point
4163,2020-12-30 02:37:54,kmr32a,"oh shit you're right, maybe Herro will be better"
4164,2020-12-30 16:30:04,kmr32a,I'll explain later.

4166,2020-12-30 01:26:33,kmr32a,"OP also has a ton of flawed premises mixed into his post, like how curry is only a good shooter because he needed to be.  Not only does this disregard the fact that there are tons of shorter players who are bad shooters, it also disregards the fact that many all time great shooters were tall, like bird, durant, Miller, even his own teammate Klay.  Well written enough post but only skin deep analysis."
4167,2020-12-30 01:24:30,kmr32a,It's pretty clear you haven't either except for youtube highlights.
4168,2020-12-30 03:39:43,kmr32a,MJ was also the best
4169,2020-12-30 01:15:54,kmr32a,Mj was a more complete basketball player? Put down the god damn crack pipe.
4170,2020-12-30 03:09:47,kmr32a,"Lmao Jordan wouldn‚Äôt make the playoffs with them? Source. 

If we‚Äôre just pulling hot takes out of our ass - harden could‚Äôve taken the 2018 cavs out of the 2018 eastern conference"
4171,2020-12-30 20:45:25,kmr32a,"This is just inaccurate. Honestly I have no fucking idea where it even comes from, it‚Äôs not based on any reality. It‚Äôs also the dumbass argument people used against Jordan when he was getting clotheslined by the pistons. 

Seriously‚Äîdo you have any actual examples of Lebron reacting negatively to physical play? The fact that he‚Äôs so big and physical that he has to sell calls while little players like harden get touched a little and go to the line? That‚Äôs your argument? 

Also, who are you saying in the league is more physical than Lebron? Especially stars. 

I‚Äôm sorry, it‚Äôs just a dumbass, nonsense argument that people only listen to because it‚Äôs so nebulous and can‚Äôt be disproven. What do you even mean by physical? He‚Äôs not getting punched in the face so he‚Äôs not tough enough? You want Lawrence Taylor to tackle him on the way to the rim? Seriously, what do you want to see? What‚Äôs your proof?"
4172,2020-12-30 07:35:31,kmr32a,"Don't you think that's an extremely high standard though? Not trying to sound like or be a dick, but very few athletes have All-Starred in 2 pro sports. Do you feel like you're not giving athletes who don't play pro in two sports a fair shake? Geniuely curious, again, not trying to be a dick."
4173,2020-12-30 05:49:08,kmr32a,"I feel like he could. So many NFL and NBA elite athletes could easily make a name for themselves in the MLB if they trained for it from a young age.

Basically almost every NFL and NBA player who's ever played high school baseball has been drafted by the MLB straight out of high school at like 18, including Brady. These players instead choose to play college ball for 3-4 years and go into NFL at 22.

Like Brandon Weeden was a 2nd round MLB pick, returned to college, became a 1st round QB basically at 27."
4174,2020-12-30 13:55:34,kmr32a,"Jokic is much more than a great passer though, you obviously don't watch him enough.

&#x200B;

Not that I necessarily disagree with the take that LeBron has higher BBIQ than Jok, but Jok is definitely up there."
4175,2020-12-30 05:52:34,kmr32a,Is*
4176,2020-12-30 01:28:29,kmr32a,I didn‚Äôt even read that point tbh. I was just focusing on the fact that a new ‚ÄúGOAT‚Äù candidate seems to come in at the same time the previous one leaves
4177,2020-12-30 01:31:39,kmr32a,"Unfortunately, I‚Äôm probably old enough to be your dad. I‚Äôve watched plenty of Jordan and Lebron."
4178,2020-12-30 03:57:50,kmr32a,I've come around on that personally. Like I said it's semantics though so it depends on your definition and criteria. They're basically 1a and 1b at this point because a good argument can be made for both.
4179,2020-12-30 01:19:04,kmr32a,"Let me ask you this on an unrelated note, do you think the star wars prequels are better than the original star wars movies?"
4180,2020-12-30 20:48:59,kmr32a,Anger... raaah. Bron D ride alert. Calm yourself
4181,2020-12-30 08:07:16,kmr32a,"Yes it‚Äôs an extremely high standard that‚Äôs the point, Bo and Deion reached it and made it look easy.

I was younger and thought athletes like that were gonna naturally become more frequent. 20+ years later they haven‚Äôt. 

Though I do put Lebron in that category I think he could‚Äôve been an All-Pro in the NFL."
4182,2020-12-30 05:57:05,kmr32a,Let me know when one of them actually does it. Tons of guys get drafted in baseball but we are talking about All-Star level talent in both sports not Brandon Weedon.
4183,2020-12-30 06:22:52,kmr32a,"It's a little hard to see your point about NFL and NBA players easily being able to cross over to the MLB when one of your examples, (Weeden), alongside a few other high-profile cases (Russell Wilson, Shaq Thompson), ended up in the NFL because they weren't good enough to make the MLB."
4184,2020-12-30 16:19:15,kmr32a,"I agree he is up there, but saying that Jokic (who has generational BBIQ for his age) is on par with Lebrons 17 years of experience is almost an insult to lebron"
4185,2020-12-30 01:25:56,kmr32a,"Fuck no I‚Äôm not a casual hayden christiansen Stan 

I do think they‚Äôre overhated tho"
4186,2020-12-30 20:50:27,kmr32a,See? You don‚Äôt even have an argument. Simmer down with the trash takes.
4187,2020-12-30 08:18:14,kmr32a,"They may have made it look easy, but also, not everyone wants to do that. The way medical treatment has advanced does make sense for athletes to pursue other pro sports more, but that may just not what they want to do that.

I love LBJ, but idk if he could handle being hit like they do in the NFL. I can honestly see every close call, LBJ crying to the refs."
4188,2020-12-30 06:12:42,kmr32a,"You can discount Weeden all you want, but he got himself picked in the 2nd round of MLB. Bo Jack was 4th round.

But forget it. Nobody in the NFL and NBA give a shit about the MLB. It's a retirement/curious hobby like golfing. Kyler went 9th overall to the A's despite him continuously denying wanting to play MLB.

Just cause Bo Jack decided to go actually boycott the NFL and play MLB full time unlike everybody else doesn't make him special. 

Deion Sanders was an NFL GOAT and juggled an MLB career as a side hobby for the fuck of it.

Elway was picked in the 2nd and given a bigger bonus than the #1 overall...and he still basically used that as an excuse to get hinself traded from the Colts to Broncos and nothing else. MLB ain't shit."
4189,2020-12-30 06:26:16,kmr32a,"Kyler then. Elway. Deion. 

And for the record, many of the NFL players drafted never even played much baseball in college and were committed to football, hence why they were drafted late. My point is that crossover athletes don't give a f. about baseball."
4190,2020-12-30 17:35:46,kmr32a,"Lmao yeah cuz anyone else being good is an insult to lebron. I fully believe jokic sees the court the same way lebron, Kidd, Nash, cp3 do. And I fully believe none of you here can accurately tell me who has the best and worst court vision and IQ out of those 5, cuz they‚Äôre all geniuses and pretty much know what any defense will do. It‚Äôs not an insult to any of them, and lebron is a better player than all of them, but because of his athleticism and scoring."
4191,2020-12-30 01:30:22,kmr32a,"The popular opinion now among fans under 30 is that the prequels are better than the originals.  It happens when you grow up with something.  In your head that thing you grew up with is the best and nothing is going to dissuade you from it.  I'm not going to bother arguing Mj vs. LBJ just remember this when the next ""Goat"" player comes to challenge Lebron."
4192,2020-12-31 01:22:43,kmr32a,Just don‚Äôt care to debate w an angry bron guy. Better things to do. Take care kiddo
4193,2020-12-30 12:43:56,kmr32a,‚ÄòHe cry‚Äôs to the refs‚Äô because it works whether you like it or not. As op said people are a product of their circumstance. He obviously wouldn‚Äôt do this if he was in the nfl because if he tried it and it didn‚Äôt work he wouldn‚Äôt keep doing it
4194,2020-12-30 06:50:05,kmr32a,MLB drafts are huge and kind of a crap shoot.  Theres a pretty long development path after they are drafted and most guys end up being minor leaguers for life.
4195,2020-12-30 06:15:49,kmr32a,"I hate baseball but you‚Äôre just categorically wrong. You think Weedon gave up being an All-Star in baseball to ride the bench in the NFL? 

We are talking about humans who can be All-Stars in multiple sports so, yes, I will continue to discount Brandon Weedon."
4196,2020-12-30 01:56:13,kmr32a,"You thought I was going to say prequels huh.. be honest 

I‚Äôm 22 btw"
4197,2020-12-30 02:02:07,kmr32a,"I didnt care what your answer was going to be, the two are very different.  I just knew you were young and wanted you to see the parallel that exists in other mediums, that this is not a phenomenon exclusive to sports."

4404,2020-12-30 13:58:02,kmmugr,"Frankly it pisses me off he even got this meeting when Nintendo clearly didn't have any interest in working with him. It basically seems like, because he's Kanye West, Reggie had to take time out of his day to coddle the man-child.

I mean, at the time it maybe wasn't clear that Kanye was more than just an eccentric guy since I don't think the article indicates when it happened. But this dude just conspired to commit pretty blatant and massive election fraud by getting on the ballot with fraudulent signatures and to this point it looks like he will face zero consequences for the same reason he got to waste Reggie's time: because while he may be a piece of shit, he's a rich, popular piece of shit."
4405,2020-12-30 14:51:20,kmmugr,How is this relevant?

4407,2020-12-30 15:58:53,kmmugr,"Have you ever personally been prescribed or put on an anti-bipolar medication? Do you know anything about their history or use?  If you had any working or academic experience you might not have such a terrible, bad take.  Years from now, I wouldn't be surprised if the sacred cow of phyciatric pharmacology is exposed for the disgusting industry it really is, where people are massively over prescribed ill-fitting drugs, often with long term side effects and negative dependencies far greater than the original symptoms.

Kanye has revolutionized multiple industries and is a billionaire. I'm pretty sure he's doing OK. Calling him a ""fucking embarrassment""... Did you pull that one from your text messages from your dad?"
4408,2020-12-30 13:00:13,kmmugr,"Em. I mean, I disagree. While I think he‚Äôs being irresponsible,slightly, he also shows that there‚Äôs no one way to live for people with bipolar or mental health. 


I struggle with my own stuff but I don‚Äôt know the full bipolar experience, but my friend had a similar struggle as Kanye. He would take meds for a while then stop because he didn‚Äôt like how they made him feel. He took them on and off because he knew he needed them at times but he couldn‚Äôt bare to live his life on meds all the time. 

There is no one way for neurotypical people to live just as there‚Äôs no one way for neurodivergants to live"
4409,2020-12-30 13:10:31,kmmugr,I mean... if he‚Äôs mentally unstable doesn‚Äôt it make sense he‚Äôs making poor decisions? If he needs help why call him a ‚Äúfucking embarrassment‚Äù. Seems kind of hypocritical.

4412,2020-12-30 13:43:58,kmmugr,He‚Äôs a pretty cool and inspiring dude. And to act like you know anything at all about a person you‚Äôve never met is laughable. The negativity you speak about Kanye is just a reflection of how you talk to yourself. I recommend some positivity and gratitude. Everything you‚Äôre not made you everything you are.
4413,2020-12-30 05:31:05,kmmugr,I honestly doubt he‚Äôs bipolar. Because his tweets? Elon Musk would be bankrupt and institutionalized already. His bipolar is Roseannes Ambien.

I explicitly said that I suffer from bipolar disorder and take medication regularly. I have an intimate knowledge of psychiatric pharmacology as I‚Äôve been prescribed various for the last 10 years, and specifically lithium for bipolar management. I am keenly aware of side effects, which are a price to pay for life long (so far) mood stability. Correct medication management and in person therapy have been instrumental in correcting my life‚Äôs trajectory. 

Big shout out to that ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù industry for letting me live a relatively stable and successful life. 

Such jerks."

He‚Äôs lucky as fuck he‚Äôs rich because if he wasn‚Äôt he‚Äôd have been committed to psych ward over and over again.

4605,2021-01-03 20:23:31,kmmugr,Chill. He payed for his mother‚Äôs surgery and she had complications from it and then passed away. He feels like he might be partially responsible for that.

4631,2020-12-30 08:59:08,kmmugr,"So funny story.

I was a background extra on a movie and got to hang out with some people in between shots. One of the guys was the body double for the A-lister (if they had a shot from behind, or just his hands, etc, they'd use this guy instead of getting the dude down from his trailer or on site) and was a pretty interesting guy. I mentioned I make video games for a living and he got all excited.

So we had a few meetings as he talked about financing and making a game. Except...all he really had in mind was that he wanted to make a game to showcase some fun aspects of his culture. I kept asking ""Well...what kind of game do you want it to be? Strategy? First person? Puzzle?"" and he'd just completely ignore the question and talk about how he wanted it to focus on THIS aspect of the culture or THAT aspect. And I'm like ""Sounds great! But I kinda need to know what kind of game this is going to be in order to build mechanics based on that."" and over three separate meetings I never once got an answer. I even made a ~10 minute long presentation where I broke down the different types of games and genres which he sat through, seemed to understand...but he still wouldn't say anything about the type.

So I just kinda let that contact fade."

4634,2020-12-30 15:59:04,kmmugr,You joke but that is literally how Kojima started in the business. He wanted to work on movies but couldn't get a job there so he went into video games. He was hired as a director or something and had no ability to code or do anything technical for the games but had ideas of what the games should be about. I think the other workers looked down on him or viewed him as a burden because of this but that made him work harder to contribute in other ways.

That's exactly how things are made in general, groups of people with certain skills each doing their part for the overall product. Next, you're going to say people who write movies are dumb, because they need actors. Gets your finger out of your ass"

Everyone knows she had a drug problem when she was young. She used to openly admit it. She addressed her mental health issues and became a better person. 

And fwiw, Harrison Ford doesn't know or give a fuck about you. He's not ""your guy"" and if he met you he'd likely think you're trash."

>	Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder characterized by periods of depression and periods of abnormally elevated mood that last from days to weeks each. If the elevated mood is severe or associated with psychosis, it is called mania; if it is less severe, it is called hypomania.

4678,2020-12-30 16:56:08,kmmugr,"Unfortunately, the statistics around the efficacy and effectiveness of drugs like lithium put your success story in the minority. Lithium itself was never designed for long term use for bipolar disorder. Most of the depression medication designed for short term use is prescribed for life without proper behavioral management.

In addition, most of these drugs were approved in the FDA under the assumption/experimental trial design they would be paired with psychological council or therapy, and they often aren't. There are people on a daily dose of a toxic drug that is supposed to stabilize or improve their mood and they aren't practicing the behaviors or mental exercises that were designed to be paired with these drugs. I'd rather be Kanye than taking pills every day with no therapy, exercise, or exploration into my mind.

If applying anecdotal experience should be the standard to judge the greater population, why don't we all just create rap albums, sneakers, high fashion lines, mansion ranch in wyoming with our families, and build our own church? If we're looking at the bi-polar population in general for guidance on how to best manage the condition, why wouldn't Kanye be a success story for the kids who can't find their place or adults who feel held back by their own emotional/mental health? Would you expect a bi-polar person to never run into challenges in their life? Is being highly medicated for life (despite growing research that there's a growing problem with over-medication) the only solution?

Your Anti-Kanye rant isn't in support of bipolar people. It seems to be in support of differing to the pharma industry with a less than perfect record when it comes to mental health. These same industries that take your monthly copay might have locked you up in mental ward on a slow sedative drip less than 60 years ago and called it medicine and charged the government and your family."

Hell, he ran a presidential campaign funded with shadow money to help him win. Why are people keep trying to make him some kind of Forrest Gump that he suddenly found himself in the Oval Office?

The claim that Nintendo has ever had any quality control on officially licensed games whatsoever was as fake as a three dollar bill. They don't restrict developers for quality: they restrict developers to create artificial scarcity in order to keep prices artificially high. They screw over all the people who do business with them and yet maintain a public image that's immune from criticism because their fans are all stupid beyond all reason.

Screw Nintendo: they are a cancer on the games industry. Not quite as bad as EA but pretty damn close."
4694,2020-12-30 12:56:42,kmmugr,I mean talk your shit all you want but everyone hypes him up as an asshole and never clarifies. Only going after what headlines say. If we believed headlines all the time we would all think Johnny Depp was a wife beater right?

Can he play any instruments?  No.  Can he sing?  No.  Can he rap?  Not really.  Does he write great lyrics?  Of course not.  If we're being honest, he doesn't really seem to know anything about music. 

But here's the thing... 

Wait, what were we talking about?"
4696,2020-12-30 00:17:06,kmmugr,probably because *he got religion.*

4721,2020-12-30 15:35:02,kmmugr,It‚Äôs time excuses stop being made for him.  He has all the resources in the world to get treatment.  And the narcissist whining is old and manipulative.

Now, I don‚Äôt give a limp, rope pushing fuck about Kanye as a person or an artist. His music isn‚Äôt to my taste and I don‚Äôt really care what celebrities do. I came to this thread out of a morbid interest in what happens at the intersection of a celebrity Reddit hates and video games. That a person surrounded by yes men who has achieved great success in one area thinks he can do anything is a little ridiculous, yes, but so is rabidly jumping on every thread about him to make sure everyone knows you‚Äôre smarter than Kanye West fans."

Literally anything cus so many major publisher games are so unbelievably similar. I know it's market forces but the market has never driven where consumers are at, the consumers do that and the market follows. Following the market is like getting fashion advice from your 80 year old neighbor in bumfuck Iowa, it's gonna be about 5 steps removed from the actual new idea.

I mean hell the only one I can think of is Kojima and that's only because he's got an entire lifetime of goodwill to spend.

Obviously Kanye isn't who you'd want, but someone other than the 30something dudebro software engineer who seems to write literally every other american game these days might not hurt."

Drugs are not to be relied on - they‚Äôre for stabilising, and intermittent use in bad patches (imo).

> someone other than the 30something dudebro software engineer

You might be surprised to learn how little influence software engineers have at most companies, regardless of whether they are dudebros.  At almost every place I've worked, the worst ideas were handed down from on high, and conceived of by people who clearly never used their own product or any of their competitors' products."
4853,2020-12-30 15:30:58,kmmugr,"It can seem that way, but it‚Äôs never really about ideas.

As I‚Äôve worked with a lot of startups, including in gaming, my personal experience is that almost everything sounds stupid on paper. It‚Äôs only when you see a really well articulated and well executed idea with a lot of competent work behind it that it turns from seemingly stupid to somehow simply brilliant. 

Most people don‚Äôt really have ideas, they have concepts. The ideas happen as a part of the process of executing the concept. And the best concepts come from people who understand the medium they work in, whatever that is. Video games or films or music. 

So for example the ‚Äúidea‚Äù of Mario isn‚Äôt an Italian who fights turtles. It‚Äôs the concept of a side scroller that uses momentum and speed as the source of challenge. If you just put it like that, it doesn‚Äôt seem interesting. But when people first played it, it was really a super appealing thing. It hadn‚Äôt been done before. The concept was non-obvious. The ‚Äúideas‚Äù about the story and what happens in the game are just details that happen for weird reasons nobody really remembers. Mario is just a character recycled from another game. Mario isn‚Äôt an idea."

4879,2020-12-30 14:40:47,kmmugr,"Lmao I don‚Äôt, but I‚Äôm also not assuming I know what‚Äôs best for him. 

You don‚Äôt know me either, but obviously that‚Äôs just what you do, you make assumptions and insult strangers to make yourself feel smart."
4880,2020-12-30 16:52:31,kmmugr,"‚Äúa person who hires people‚Äù Wow you should teach business. 

I don‚Äôt own anything he sells, but the fact is he created a consumer brand and has done it successfully. Regardless of what you think of the product or the people who buy them, he created a space in the market and it continues to grow. He signed a 10 year contract with Gap this year. The results speak for themselves. I don‚Äôt even follow his life like that, but he‚Äôs clearly a highly productive person and delivers results when it comes to his businesses."
4881,2020-12-30 08:38:34,kmmugr,So you're not gonna admit that you're ignorant to the terms I was using and that caused you to make an embarrassing response?

My point was Keanu is a pretty boring guy and doesn‚Äôt seem to have many controversies nor is he a Grifter or a clout chaser. 

Kanye does seemingly everything he can to be the worst person imaginable.

To claim that Keanu fans are just as bad as Kanye apologists is downright asinine"
4887,2020-12-30 16:21:46,kmmugr,"If there's any group as vocal as Kanye lovers, it's Kanye haters. Yall loooooove wasting breath on each other every time his name is dropped."
4888,2020-12-30 16:51:46,kmmugr,They clarified that they also aren‚Äôt going to read past the headlines because that would make him look less bad..  as if reading context on what someone meant and learning the truth is a bad thing.
4889,2020-12-30 03:20:40,kmmugr,"just read through this whole comment section lol mfs acting like kanye west got their wife pregnant or something. i listen to a lot of rap and he‚Äôs probably not even in my top 15 rappers plus i disagree with a lot of shit he says/does but what do we gain from calling a man with bipolar crazy and shitting on his objectively impressive musical career.

if becoming one of the most prolific (and commercially successful) artists of the 2010‚Äôs without any musical talent is so easy why isn‚Äôt everyone doing it?"
4890,2020-12-30 13:24:54,kmmugr,People have been pretending he does have talent for a long time.  Can't I point out the obvious just this one time?
4891,2020-12-30 13:43:18,kmmugr,"Well, somebody's delusional.  Kanye has no talent, that much is obvious.  He seems to be riding some kind of cult wave, similar to what Trump managed to pull off (despite being utterly incompetent).  He was hyped up by Jay-Z and Rolling Stone magazine, and turned into some kind of Jesus Of Rap figure.  His fans are convinced everything he does must be amazing, even though it sucks, because he's a genius, which he obviously isn't. 

It's bizarre."
4892,2020-12-30 21:51:06,kmmugr,Maybe I am.  A lot of people absolutely worship that talentless motherfucker.  Maybe I'm supposed to have the wherewithal just to go along.
4893,2020-12-30 13:23:51,kmmugr,"You can't deny his wife's popularity either, and she has absolutely no talent whatsoever."
4894,2020-12-30 16:57:00,kmmugr,"So I beg you to read past headlines and figure out that all this is bullshit. Slavery was a choice is still taken outta context years later even though he‚Äôs been saying it in music long before his TMZ rant. Idk where you see him defending abusers, and his attempt to run for president has been his plan since 2015. Just because you view it as a jaded attempt for Trump in your shallow view on him doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the case. People are multilayered and he denounced Trump with his own announcement."

She‚Äôs not the butt of any jokes, and doesn‚Äôt have any real features to reference a real person. I guess they also parody Aquaman and Jesus technically but those aren‚Äôt really related to Kanye."

4902,2020-12-30 15:40:06,kmmugr,That potus run was the dumbest thing he has ever done.  The humiliating press conference etc and being used by Jared in an attempt to get POC votes.  Brutal.
4903,2020-12-30 16:15:00,kmmugr,"I think both of you have a point.  If you're rich as hell, you've got all sorts of resources at your fingertips.  On the other hand, his mom died and he may have some issues he's not aware of.  And after you're rich and famous and older, it's hard if not impossible to make real friends you can trust.  I don't think we need to choose strictly between either pouring our hearts out for him or scorning him.  He's just... kind of in a bad mental/emotional place."
4904,2020-12-30 15:51:03,kmmugr,Why are u getting so fucking mad at the dude? He is ultimately harmless ffs yall get upset at celebrities for the weirdest shit like some are bitching about him loving his mom now? Direct some of that energy towards sister fister lena dunham or something

Next Generation ranked it as the 98th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Overall sales of Bulletproof reached 850,000 units in the United States by July 2006.

This was in spite of negative reviews. It sold purely based on the 50 Cent brand, because the sequel did not sell nearly as well even though it reviewed much better."
4918,2020-12-30 06:54:35,kmmugr,CDPR already had a reputation to ruin and people hated cyberpunk because it didn‚Äôt meet their expectation. Everyone would already know a kanye game would be trash and would only buy it for the novelty. There‚Äôs no expectations to not meet.

4920,2020-12-30 13:08:54,kmmugr,"But CDPR has a bad reputation because their product is shit, which they should have since they were responsible for developing the video game.  No one is accusing them of being bad because they worked with Keanu."

Kim took no risks, she was just, ‚ÄúParis Hilton‚Äôs personal assistant who had sex with Ray J.‚Äù And knowing the whole family isn‚Äôt exactly something worth bragging about, that show has done nothing to contribute to the welfare of it‚Äôs audience. It has left no legacy worth bragging about by it‚Äôs creators other the the enormous wealth it has made them. It only further perpetuates celebrity worship and materialism. The name itself is a play on the old expression ‚ÄúKeeping Up With The Joneses.‚Äù Which, by its very definition, is pathetic:

‚Äúinformal + often disapproving. : to show that one is as good as other people by getting what they have and doing what they do people trying to keep up with the Joneses by buying expensive cars and clothes that they can't afford.‚Äù

She's famous because she was famous; even more than other businesses it warps the environment around you. The impressive part is capitalising on the first fluke/s.

Also, I'm not a fan of either, but I hear people say this a lot. I know her name, and I knew Kanye's before that; people who can name the whole family watch the show/s or are exposed to a bubble that does, because I can tell you straight up there are a lot of people who genuinely don't know the first thing about them.

We have 60% of the picture and that 60% is enough to see that he's not doing what's right for his family.

Anyone who thinks ""You don't know them personally, you can't say that"" is a moron. If that were true, then we could only comment on people that we know personally.

Oh I agree with all of that, trust me I don't think they're admirable in anyway. like I said I don't watch them and its basically for these reasons. But to argue they've only been participants in their success is ridiculous. Just look at someone like Kim Zociak, she's desperately trying to make her family the next Kardashians, but she's just one of 1000s of reality TV show stars who aren't going to make it. So it's not something that is handed to you.

Even look at Paris Hilton, her and her family haven't achieved the same level of hegemony that the Kardiashians have, despite being better connected and better known before them.

You might not like it, I don't, but it's crazy to suggest their long term success is entirely down to Ryan Seacrest giving them a TV show.

>And knowing the whole family isn‚Äôt exactly something worth bragging about,

Did I tell you I can count to 10 too! But this isn't a brag it's a demonstration of how well known they are compared to other reality TV stars - alot of whom have their own sex tapes. I'm not from the US and I've lived in Asia and the Middle East and it really blew my mind how far their influence has spread beyond the reality TV realm."

It's like me saying, I once went to the ER for a broken leg so I know exactly what those kids in the cancer ward are going through. 

Bipolar can be mild and easily treated or it can be so bad, that I know people that have completely had their lives ruined while in a manic state and would be homeless or dead if they didn't have a support network around them. 

Unless you've seen someone lose their grip on reality and go through months long of a bender and the effect it has on their life that takes them years to come back from, you wouldn't just call it 'a choice' they can get over with sheer will power. 

I've also had rich, privileged friends suffer from it the worst because their family didn't believe in all that and felt they could just throw money in to giving them a comfortable life to get over it.

5052,2020-12-30 14:58:15,kmmugr,"You're making up strawmen now to argue against cause none of that was in my original comments.

>Western culture has been influencing the world for centuries. Hollywood, in particular, has done more influencing than any propaganda machine in the history of man since the 1920s. It's the reason for Japanese dying their skin lighter and African Americans straightening their hair... etc. If this is ""blowing your mind"" then I'm seriously concerned with what mind was even there to begin with.

Huh? I am not expressing amazement that western culture is well known outside of the US. I'm impressed at how well known the Kardashians are outside of the US.

>And, for your information, the Hilton family is worth about 5 billion dollars from their hotel and real estate investment empire. 

I was not comparing net worth I was comparing levels of fame. As you said most of their money came from their hotel and other interests, not from their fame. So that shows just how well the Kardashians have done off the back of their show.

>Try to argue that all you want, but it's undeniable that they would not be where they are now without that show.

Thats exactly what I am saying, I've never denied that, yes they're only famous for being on that show. In fact I said that they've took that opportunity and exploited far far better than anyone before them."

How does BB 'help' its audience in a way Kardashians doesn't? Contribute to the welfare of its audience? ('Welfare??!)

Not everything needs to be highbrow to be a valid form of entertainment. I hope you're a snob about other things too. I'd hope you're not denouncing the Kardashians but watching every single Fast and Furious, or reading US Weekly or whatever, or reading Danielle Steele.

You're just a snob. I don't watch it but I don't watch F&F films or the million CSI shows that are all the same.

Dare I say there's an element of sexism here? These shows appeal more to women than men, so they're harmful dross! But mindless MAN films are ok!"

on top of this, i feel like you‚Äôre giving no merit to artistic vision. art is supposed to elicit emotion: if a piece does that effectively then it‚Äôs successful imo. your criticism of rap kinda sounds like someone shutting on Picasso for not making photorealistic drawings. It‚Äôs not that 85+% of these artists are anywhere close to Picasso‚Äôs level of talent, the point is Picasso‚Äôs art isn‚Äôt supposed to be photorealistic, the same way Chief Keef‚Äôs music was never intended to be deep, lyrical, or whatever else we typically expected ‚Äúgood‚Äù rap to be. he made music to go hard as fuck to and it clearly accomplished that (and massively influenced the rap game in the process).

pre-emptive edit: Picasso is a bad example honestly. i‚Äôm trying to say that stuff like expressionism/abstraction exists and is accepting in painting. obviously technical skill is still required to paint the painting but imo that must be much easier than painstakingly recreating a scene and going to great lengths to blend all the brush strokes and stuff. 

i guess another example would be Hemingway‚Äôs books. he doesn‚Äôt write incredibly abstractly or with beautiful detail or anything else you‚Äôd expect from a famous author. his works are lauded for his straightforward yet captivating writing style."

Success is capitalising on luck, but even that's not deterministic. And the important thing is the luck, because you can get lucky enough to fall upwards, you can't be determined enough to succeed with nothing. Even if you think success is a binary thing, either you've got the personality and skills to succeed or not, you can't argue with a straight face that the degree of success is controllable."

It just sounds like you don't like the form of entertainment that the Kardashians are providing. Which is fine. Faux-scripted nonsense designed to create the illusion of a window into another life isn't for everyone. That doesn't mean it's objectively bad.

The reason I mentioned BB is because you say Kardashians doesn't 'benefit the welfare of its audience' because it involves drugs. If that's your criticism then fine but why is it ok for BB to be about drugs? They're both scripted shows. Why is the Kardashisms being about drugs 'bad for society', when BB is 'good for society'."

5108,2020-12-30 08:38:37,kmmugr,"yup exactly. i totally understand not supporting an artist, especially financially, who you disagree with. for example, i listened to xxxtentacion even though i am strongly against abuse of women (can‚Äôt believe we even have to make that known in 2020 but that‚Äôs a different point entirely). i didn‚Äôt buy any merch, go to any concerts, or pay for his albums, though. also never defended him as a person, but i would have similar arguments with people about how his music shouldn‚Äôt be dismissed just because of his violent/troubled history.

this isn‚Äôt even limited to art/entertainers, either. there are plenty of scientists, politicians, engineers, etc. who have accomplished crazy things, things that are really significant for society, but who held personal views or were involved in controversies that many people would find troubling. first example i can think of is steve jobs. he undoubtedly changed the consumer tech industry, but he was also definitely a shitty/neglectful father/ex, and a horribly cruel boss. still, his impact on society can‚Äôt be understated."

5110,2020-12-30 08:59:26,kmmugr,"Yeah, pretty much.

I dont listen to pop myself at all, really. But from what i can tell its just whatever is 'catchy enough', and easy to make that seems to flood it. Anyone will start to like most music if its played on the radio often enough for them to get accustomed to it, so i dont think its all down to 'its popular so its there'.
