The tip of her nose, the middle of her upper lip and the middle of her lower lip don't line up. They are slightly leaning to the right (from a viewers perspective) from bottom to top and nose itself seems to point to the right as well.

It may be only a distortion caused by the camera."

44,2020-03-18 01:37:48,fj65iz,"Why yes, yes I do!! If you like the setting & premise of Tree Nymphs, start at the beginning of that series which is **How to Date Your Dragon**. Second is **Love and Other Wild Things**. Next is the Tree Nymphs novella (2.5 I think) and third & final to date is **Selkies are a Girl’s Best Friend**.  It’s a really fun series. 

My favorite is her Jame Jamison series (fun vampires!! - the first is **Nice Girls Don’t Have Fangs**.) She has others but these two series will get you started. Amanda Ronconi narrates everything of her’s except, I think, Changling and others in that series. They are a perfect combo."

47,2020-03-13 03:25:09,fhphzr,"It seems a bit baffling to not have included [What A Wonderful World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3yCcXgbKrE).  It's quite easily one of the most iconic (and beautiful) songs in his oeuvre. Maybe it gets overplayed in comparison to the entirety of the rest of the list. But end of the day, there is a reason for that fact and it's hard to ignore."
48,2020-03-13 16:48:49,fhphzr,"Armstrong's discography is of such volume and magnitude (even Elvis and James Brown are put to shame) that it's impossible to boil him down to just twenty songs. Having said that, that's a damn good list and I absolutely love your liner notes for each song. 

Most notable omissions for me: ""Heebie Jeebies"" and ""Lazy River"". The former was the musical equivalent of discovering fire. How Satchmo was able to catch such explosiveness on such primitive recording equipment at a time when classical was still the default... Hell, it was miraculous. ""Lazy River"" is merely a personal favourite- in my opinion the best of Armstrong's vocal deliveries, capturing all his charisma, humour and contentedness."

50,2020-03-13 01:36:38,fhphzr,"Nice walk through the history - thanks!

Where is ""Just A Closer Walk With Thee"" from?

I'm much fonder of the early stuff, personally - the Hot 5 & 7 and his early big band.

I particularly like ""I'm a Ding-Dong Daddy"" for the trumpet work and ""Lazy River"" for the vocals.

And you can't leave out the trumpet-playing behind Jimmie Rodgers (but I forget the tune) if only for the crossover value"
51,2020-03-13 03:30:46,fhphzr,"Ahh, just re-read. You picked 20 *different* songs. In that case, nice work. Armstrong was truly one of the greats."
52,2020-03-13 03:39:18,fhphzr,"Fair points. I did consider this. Here was my thought process:

* [Riccardi used it already.](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6JbWdGJ6NdhmQflyUgFtVp?si=SXYrR417R2-H1f2W7yXGuw) I was going for 20 totally different songs, and he already snagged it.

* It's not a jazz band on that song. I was trying to make a list for r/jazz, focusing on his jazz output. 

* I *almost* chose the  [1970 version with the spoken intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4BYsKq4bqA) but I decided instead to pick ""The Creator Has a Master Plan"" (from the same album).

I consider that song the anthem of humanity! It is a truly great song. When they first showed Armstrong the lyrics to this song, he said, ""What is this shit?"" But he dug deep and made it real. I don't think anybody else could have pulled off that song."
53,2020-03-13 20:00:21,fhphzr,"Glad you dig it!

I chose ""Skit-dat-de-dat"" instead of ""Heebie Jeebies"" as a good example of his early scat because I think it's just an overall better song. But yes ""Heebie Jeebies"" is indeed historic. Mezz Mezzrow said that it lit them all on fire, they went wild over it and drove 50 miles to go show the new record to Bix Beiderbecke. He said every hipster knew the scat by heart and would greet each other on the street with it!

Armstrong's story is that he accidentally dropped the lyrics and didn't want to ruin the take, and he didn't actually expect them to release it. He didn't invent scat, though, but he was probably the first to record it and probably the best to do it."
54,2020-03-13 20:21:00,fhphzr,"> ""Lazy River""

Wow, I'm not sure I've heard this before -- definitely a thrilling performance!"
55,2020-03-15 23:40:37,fhphzr,Armstrong & Earl Hines is up there with Bird & Diz and Miles & Coltrane

57,2020-03-13 02:34:32,fhphzr,"Glad you dig it!

> Where is ""Just A Closer Walk With Thee"" from?

This is a little embarrassing. It's from an album with a group of white boys called the Dukes of Dixieland. The album cover is absurd -- I think from their second album together, *Louis and the Dukes of Dixieland*. But they provided fine backing for him on this song and just let him do his thing.

> I'm much fonder of the early stuff, personally - the Hot 5 & 7 and his early big band.

Agreed, but it's good to know he was still playing his ass off in the 50s. 

> I particularly like ""I'm a Ding-Dong Daddy"" for the trumpet work and ""Lazy River"" for the vocals.

I need to check these out!

> trumpet-playing behind Jimmie Rodgers (but I forget the tune)

[Blue Yodel No. 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA9Y9FkxJZo). 40 years later [Armstrong played it with Johnny Cash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6F7pIF4zOU)."
58,2020-03-14 16:28:43,fhphzr,That's a fair argument!
59,2020-03-13 20:23:59,fhphzr,"It's also just a lovely song - the Mills Brothers do a nice version, too."
60,2020-03-13 06:03:21,fhphzr,"Love that Cash duet!

""Ding Dong Daddy"" was also done by Bob Wills.

Dukes of Dixieland - Aha!  No wonder I've never heard it - that record always looked so cheesy."
61,2020-03-13 06:07:38,fhphzr,"> that record always looked so cheesy

Yeah, I only looked up the song because Ricky Riccardi's book spoke so highly of it. I'm looking forward to his new book about Armstrong in the Swing Era."

66,2020-03-13 03:43:16,fh6vdw,Lincoln Center link seems broken so [here's Riccardi's spotify playlist of Armstrong in 20 songs](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6JbWdGJ6NdhmQflyUgFtVp?si=SXYrR417R2-H1f2W7yXGuw) --- he chose a lot more from the Swing Era than I did.
67,2020-03-12 23:07:18,fh6vdw,[This one?](https://youtu.be/fHjZQb-kGek?t=91) -- yeah this is pretty great!
68,2020-03-13 02:29:50,fh6vdw,Dizzy and Armstrong lived a few blocks away from each other in Queens. Dizzy would play cards & smoke joints at Armstrong's house. Eventually Dizzy was one of Armstrong's pallbearers.
69,2020-03-17 03:58:01,fh6vdw,I'm glad you dig it! I'd be curious which deep cuts are your favorites
70,2020-03-12 23:17:02,fh6vdw,Yes!
71,2020-03-17 07:12:30,fh6vdw,I had no idea that Louis covered Pharoah Sanders.
72,2020-03-12 23:52:30,fh6vdw,"I think that's the same year he made a lovely solo on ""La Vie En Rose"", 1951. He loved melodies that tugged on the heart strings, but he was good at not being maudlin about it."
73,2020-03-17 07:32:46,fh6vdw,Right?! Make sure to check out the unreleased mix -- much better.

But, I’d say a lot of practicing poly relationships aren’t mature enough to exercise that level of self responsibility. Maybe if more were to hold that responsibility for others, I would agree. Until then, poly is a big meh to me.(my gf and I have discussed bringing another into our relationship someday, but we plan on making sure we’re both okay and everything taken care of on our ends first)"

192,2020-04-16 17:36:19,g2gk5i,"ANY relationship requires good communication. Without legitimately good communication, there’s hardly any foundation regardless of the type of relationship. 

Honestly, I haven’t seen enough poly relationships to form a legitimate opinion on it, so I can’t make definitive statements on those that are poly. That’s not to say that I haven’t seen any, just not enough. I have, however, seen monogamous relationships everywhere I go and sheer amount of problems that arise in those relationships, a lot of those problems relating to the poor structure that is built upon monogamy."
193,2020-04-17 01:06:57,g2gk5i,"Hahaha, thanks for the clarification of the terms. I more meant poly as the blanket term, but I suppose it’s better for me to be more specific. 

I guess it would be polyamory that would technically  fit.

Thank you. ❤️ I definitely agree with your view on jealousy and insecurity. They only serve to work against our progression."
194,2020-04-18 05:07:33,g2gk5i,"This is something I had pondered for some time. After seeing multiple polyamorist relationships I had come to the distinct feeling that it was usually one of the members of the group that pushed for expanding the bounds of their relationship. 

It usually started off with Parties A and B having a great time together but either member felt like they wanted to expand their horizons while the other party out of love(or maybe fear) went through with an open relationship in hopes that it would be a group effort of sorts. Except this usually caused much anxiety and separation issues between them to the point that the relationships started falling apart.

I've only seen it work successfully in one instance but even they had their challenges that took a toll on the original relationship. Most others usually fell apart through what I assumed was a jealousy issue popping due to it being a very sore subject for the remaining parties so I never really pressed the issue.

In my personal experience I never thought that entertaining more partners in a relationship was a viable situation for myself. Except when I had opened up to the idea, that my partner at the time kept insisting, into inviting another person into the bedroom our roles were reversed and now I realized that I'm more than accepting of this kind of relationship whilst he ended up backing out twice due to a possessive  attitude he couldn't overcome.

So beyond that relationship I am now left with these new emotions only to realize how difficult of a task it is having multiple people in a relationship. In the end it isn't about the sex it's more of a group mentality of joining our capacity of extreme love with more than just one other.

I guess I'm writing this because I often wondered how difficult it would be to go through with a polyamorist lifestyle. Is it something that as a humans from this era can't comprehend because of our circumstances or is the ability to join together in Union beyond the monogamist ideal something rooted through past lives in civilizations that encouraged such acts of love.

Is this something that I should restrain from mentioning when meeting other potential partners or save it unless they also have those feelings? 

I ask because the gay culture I've found that open relationships are common but usually involve emotional insecurities that get poked and prodded to the point where it's seen as normal but in a nagative connotation. It's a grievance that becomes the norm for relationships because of the pervasive ...(I can't find the word)... There's alot of cheating and lying in gay culture - which I'm not saying it's exclusive to just that it's starting to become normal which I bring up because I've met others who have developed trust issues from their experiences."
195,2020-04-18 06:09:38,g2gk5i,"> *I'm more than accepting of this kind of relationship whilst he ended up backing out twice due to a possessive attitude he couldn't overcome.*

Ok that is hilarious to me. If I understood correctly—they initiated the situation, you mentally and emotionally steeled yourself to participate, and then he who initiated ended up shutting the situation down! I wonder if some of the insecurity that arose was his surprise that you were willingly participating and facilitating the event. I bet that your enthusiasm itself shut the thing down. Your partner was probably subconsciously hoping *you’d* refuse or shut it down and when push came to shove, he ended up putting the kibosh on it. 

I’ve been with my guy for 11+ years and we are and have been monogamous. My guy prefers not to share. Going in to the relationship I had the mental model that gay partnerships were super open or it was always a matter of time before they opened up, however I can say that it’s not in the cards for me and my soulmate. I’m more social of the two but wouldn’t ever be able to have a dalliance on the side because he’s so psychic that the minute I’d walk in I think he’d instantly know and say “OK who is he...?” 

I agree that there is a lot of cheating and lying in gay male culture, irrespective of the stated or evolving status of most gay couples. I mean if you think about it, we have lied and lied and lied just to squeak by and survive in our formative years. In today’s welcoming and equitable environment, needing to be duplicitous is no longer necessary. But I think it almost becomes a comfort zone of sorts for some.

You’ve talked about what you experience and what you expect, however I kinda wanna know what you *want*? What is your mental model or template for a potential partner(s) or romantic situation?"
196,2020-04-18 15:45:18,g2gk5i,"Yeah he kept instigating that we have a threesome and me at the time being against it I kept saying no until we had a mutual friend come into the picture. 

So we finally get to it and in the middle of the act he said no he couldn't do it he didn't feel right and became aggressive. Tried a second time and we had the same issue so I confront him going what hells mang. He said he didn't like sharing me with anyone else and that he could see himself with another person just not me so I said noway.

Hindsight 20/20 I did end up realizing that he had a way of trying to sabotage the relationship for attention which after many years I declined to continue falling into. Which by now my horizons had been expanded though I couldn't find much other polyamorists to explore this feeling.

I ended up not pursuing those feelings even with having some doors opened to me out of the pain I had gone through and seeing friends go through what they had attempting to become a thruple. 

As to what I want wanted? I ended up forgoing  any sort of monogamist idealization and instead found my self visualizing love in a group. I ended up doing it more often than I care to admit and found myself meeting that possibility with my twin flame but sadly that fell through. 

So what does someone want after facing this dilemma? Nothing. I stopped wanting anything and came to a realization that what I wanted was beyond the capability of society providing and if I were to actually attempt anything then I would have to build it but unfortunately I have gained new insights into life that left me no longer desiring anything.

Enter the question of what I want? What does someone who no longer desires anything desires? 

I delved into my old desires to figure out why this feeling of polyamorist ideals came to the front and it is because I know I have so many facets to my personality that to find an equal to my level of crazy was nearly impossible so I had inadvertently began seeking individuals to fulfill the enormity of my love.

I hope to share that what I felt with my twin wasn't a strong lust for another person to fulfill my needs. It was a reflection of myself. We were so very alike but at the same time equally opposites in so many ways. What we both felt was undeniable and I learned from her as I'm sure she learned from me. She saw what her polyamorist life had done to her through having multiple partners yet none of them ended up being her ultimate so amongst all that love there was still loneliness while I in turned saw that in my desire I had isolated myself out of having an opposite reaction to that love that left me isolated through a subconscious desire to not wanting to feel the pain of a relationship let alone multiple relationships.

So what do I want? A partner that can challenge me and to grow together with. Someone(s) to see through my thoughts that I can check my sanity or insanity against. I guess to be completely honest I'd like to find another person where I can hold complete honesty and trust with. I really don't enjoy mind games where the goal is to gain leverage over the other person. I have the ideals of a child with the pains of a politician.

From that I've learned that love doesn't have to come from a single other and that it can be fulfilled through myself but it doesn't mean I don't have sexual attraction and that I don't have the innate desire of socializing. So knowing this I still have hope to finding a partner but I rarely visualize a person(s) fulfilling any of that."

199,2020-04-14 17:14:58,g195kk,"Maybe a canoe ride? That’d be cute. As far as parks based material, Grandmother Willow was in the 3 Walt Disney World Pocahontas attractions I can think of: The Spirit of Pocahontas, Pocahontas and her Forest Friends, and Sounds of the Rainforest, so there’s no doubt she’ll be in an attraction somewhere."
200,2020-04-14 16:56:36,g195kk,I feel like if they don’t make a grandmother willow attraction there’s not many other options. So I’m pretty hopeful she’ll be one! Id like to see ratcliffe too just because I like the villains lol. They don’t have Si and Am for Lady and the Tramp though
201,2020-04-14 17:28:13,g195kk,"I think we’ll get Pocahontas, John Smith, and Meeko for sure. I think that Flit, Percy, and Ratcliffe also have a high chance of being included too. For attractions I agree that Grandmother Willow should definitely be one. The village camp could be cool along with a “Just around the riverbend” canoe ride!"
202,2020-04-14 17:08:35,g195kk,"My guesses are:
- Pocahontas
- John Smith
- Meeko
- Flit
- Powhatan
- Radcliffe
- Thomas"
203,2020-04-14 20:04:30,g195kk,"Let's be honest I guess we all thought back then that Pocahontas would have been perfect for an event (contraty to... let's say Moana which gave the impression they really had to add secondary characters to make an event out of it). Here the number of characters is just perfect (they could also easily make a 10 characters event for it). Now that it was said during the livestream that the next update would be permanent content, that we just got 6 new permanent characters with Lady and the Tramp, that we can also expect a comfy costume, attractions, concessions and decorations, I have the feeling they could do it in several parts like they did with Jungle Book, Cinderella, Peter Pan or Pirates to avoid so many things to do at once. A cool way to do it - and make sure the 2nd part is as good as the 1st - could be a 1st part with Natives (Pocahontas, Flit, Meeko) and a 2nd one later with the English crew (John Smith, Percy, Ratcliffe). Of course Thomas, Powhatan and Nakoma could also find their place but so many characters could be added that we will have to forget some of them. I easily would trade Moana's parents (and probably some from other sets) for any of the characters that won't be added this time."
204,2020-04-14 17:42:57,g195kk,Where do we think the content will sit in the story? Hoping it’s not after Dumbo because I don’t want big ticket items. Lady and the Tramp was pretty expensive all together so maybe they’ll place it earlier in the story to be in contrast.
205,2020-04-14 18:52:08,g195kk,"What about concession stands and decor? I think they’ll have some type of Meeko themed (hat, backpack, wishable) stand because of his popularity. I don’t know about food, although they seem to like corn in the movie and the parks sell ears of corn at festivals. I haven’t thought too much about decor."
206,2020-04-14 18:25:33,g195kk,"I worked at Disneyland in the late 90’s, and there was a Pocahontas show (I think called Colors of the Wind) in the Fantasyland Theater, so maybe that?"
207,2020-04-14 21:30:49,g195kk,"Everyone is so excited for a full set of characters. (Me too!!)

But let's watch, it will end up being just Pocahontas and maybe John Smith.  
I'd be so disappointed.  


My wish list is definitely:  
Pocahontas  
John Smith  
Grandmother Willow (in some shape or form...did I say I was out of room for attractions? Haha, silly me. \*stuffs useless Merlin attractions in the box\*)  
Nakoma  
Flit  
Meeko  
Percy  
Powhatan  
Ratcliffe   
Maybe Thomas.   


I think besides Grandmother Willow as an attraction we could get one based on the songs:  
Just Around the River Bend and Colors of the Wind.  
Possibly the Powhatan Village/Cornfield, the settlers fort/ship."
208,2020-04-15 02:24:09,g195kk,"Besides Pocahontas, Meeko and  Ratcliffe would be awesome to have. And Grandmother Willow."
209,2020-04-15 05:26:05,g195kk,"Rather start with 3 and expand after a while. Knowing the moneygrabbers though @Gameloft, they will just fill it up with as many chars as possible"
210,2020-04-15 15:53:24,g195kk,"My guess is

Pocahontas
John Smith
Ratcliffe
Meeko
Flit
Percy

3 humans 3 animals! ❤"
211,2020-04-14 17:17:17,g195kk,A canoe ride would be cute! Especially if the kids could ride it.
212,2020-04-14 16:59:21,g195kk,"Yeah, I mean they could do Ratcliffe and Percy as the premiums since they sometimes like to have some themeing with those choices.

As for Si and Am, they are the reason there's a warning on the movie on Disney+ 😂"
213,2020-04-14 17:09:34,g195kk,Thomas over Percy? I like your boldness!
214,2020-04-14 21:23:07,g195kk,"I thought Pocahontas would have made a good event too, but as long as some important characters aren’t left out, I guess we could still be happy with Pocahontas as main story. And we won’t have to worry about collecting them from chests. I’m really hoping this princess of the land brings some new land with her."
215,2020-04-14 17:58:11,g195kk,"If it comes with land, like maybe a plot in Frontierland, it might come after any storyline in that area."
216,2020-04-14 17:47:39,g195kk,"That's a good question! I also hope it's earlier than later because I'm not about more Legendary items.

But... since I felt Onward was pretty easy, it makes me worry that this'll be post-Dumbo.

Also, if they do a mini-event for Pocahontas' comfy costume like they did for Rapunzel, then we might be able to get her as an early release. They did that for people who hadn't gotten Rapunzel yet."
217,2020-04-14 18:59:02,g195kk,"Since they stopped letting us outright buy concessions I've stopped caring about them personally 😂 like I totally forgot until right now that they had any concessions for Lady and the Tramp. 

If I don't get excited about them, I won't be bummed when I don't get them."
218,2020-04-14 17:28:47,g195kk,"They still have the Davy Crockett Explorer Canoes in Disneyland. Different film, but could use the same premise."
219,2020-04-14 17:04:15,g195kk,"Yeah I heard about that. But I think they wouldn’t have a problem doing br’er bear, rabbit, and fox because the parks still have them. So Si and Am could still be incorporated but they’d also have to add 2 characters instead of just one for them lol"
220,2020-04-14 17:20:04,g195kk,I could definitely see Percy (and even Nakoma) being possibilities too. I suggested Thomas because having 3 out of 7 characters be animals for the collection seems kind of high imo. But if it is Percy I’d love to see some fun animated tasks between him and Meeko :)
221,2020-04-14 23:48:15,g195kk,"Oh I'm not complaining it's not an event but at least with events we are sure to get 7 characters at once. Maybe that will be the case with Pocahontas but I don't feel it that way. I hope I'm wrong of course but as I stated, there are more characters I think deserve to be added from Pocahontas than from Moana (don't get me wrong I really like the movie but we only have 3 major characters in it not 7). Also, you can trust Gameloft : there will probably be something chest exclusive. They know they can get money from it so maybe we will have more than premium content.
I also think we will get some new land in frontierland or in adventureland (Mount Everest still has to be unlocck, that could be the condition to start the Pocahontas storyline)."
222,2020-04-14 21:17:33,g195kk,"That’s true. I don’t like how they hype us up for us not to have any practical way to obtain it anymore. I remember buying all the concession stands when Little Mermaid had an event, simply because I was so excited at the time it came to the game. It really kills the excitement I used to feel over events and permanent content to see that everything new gets mixed in with older stuff (I have plenty of already) in a chest. 🙁 I don’t see the point of having a shop or even a Merlin’s Shop anymore if everything is just going to be shoved into chests."
223,2020-04-15 02:11:33,g195kk,"I would connect Pocahontas more to Frontierland than I would Adventureland. Frontierland is supposed to be American, whereas Everest is over in Asia, so it really doesn’t make sense to come with Pocahontas.

I know what you’re saying about the 7 character format being the norm for events now. It’s putting a lot of minor characters into the game that otherwise wouldn’t be here. Moana’s parents aren’t the only ones. Random stormtrooper. Pretty much all of the Frozen 2 characters who were added. Blazey from Onward (who was in the film for maybe a minute). When I have to collect 100s of tokens for a character, I want them to be an integral part of the story and that’s why I haven’t bothered with the premium characters for the last few events. I hope they are starting to mix up the main storyline a bit and add more characters from films that have a lot of interesting ones. And sometimes a film has more than 7 interesting ones too. If they ever add Robin Hood, I could easily see more than 7."

234,2020-04-10 10:13:02,fy7l4l,"Beauty standards are not, unlike the name suggest, an actual standard. They are the most visible trends that people like to look at at this point in time. What we consider attractive traits changes all the time. Most likely after the current rise in plastic surgery and alternating ones looks, more natural features will come to fashion which likely means less exaggerated bodies, thinner lips, less makeup, natural hair colours and softer styles. You can also compare these trends to other countries. Japan has a very natural and “unsexy” ideals where no makeup makeup is the thing such as natural looking faces and soft covering clothes. In France the standard have always been to look effortless and age gracefully, got wrinkles, its charisma, the ideal is a powerful, independent and creative woman who dressed as if they didn’t try but still look cool. 

You can look how ever you want! If people around you happen to have ideals that’s not yours then what ever. Out here in the world there are so many places that would think very differently. Americans think you look too casual or whatever? You’d go down a riot in London’s Camden. Want to have natural dreads but people around you don’t think it’s trendy? Try sporting them in Berlin and see how cool people think they are. 

Your standards aren’t wrong, your audience is the wrong one."

243,2020-04-05 18:38:31,fva930,"EDIT: If you can wait a couple of days, I think I'll create a `--onlymissing` command line option you can use for this. It is currently possible using a different method described below, but it is a bit harder to do and understand.

ORIGINAL: It will scrape all files again with TheGamesDb and cache that data as well unless you tell it specifically what files you want to scrape. Then it combines all of it when generating the gamelist from the priorities defined in ~/.skyscraper/cache/PLATFORM/priorities.xml

You can tell it to only scrape certain files using the cache report option. Then use the fromfile option to scrape only the files contained in the report. Read more about this here: https://github.com/muldjord/skyscraper/blob/master/docs/CLIHELP.md#--cache-reportmissingall-textual-artwork-media-or-resource1resource2

244,2020-04-05 19:09:32,fva930,"Aah.. an --onlymissing command would rock!

What defines as being missing? So for example if there was a rom that had a description, but no cover/marquee/etc, would it look for those individual items?

Or is it only if there is no description that it will look for it?

Or does it literally look for each entry what sections aren't populated? so on one may be a cover, another may be a marquee and a third may be a description?"
245,2020-04-05 20:04:16,fva930,"No, the design is currently not great at solving the puzzle like that. It will only check if a game exists in the cache with any type of data, and skip it if it does. So if a game has even one piece of data in the cache, for instance a description, it will be skipped entirely. I know this is not optimal, but it's that or nothing I'm afraid. :) That's why, normally, you would just scrape all files with several sources entirely. The sources rarely have a ""give me only the description"" API option. So it makes little sense to look at it that way.

EDIT: The '--onlymissing' option is on the master branch in git now if you want to test it. If that's a bit too technical for you, I think I will release it tomorrow evening (about 24 hours from now). Then you can just update it when it's released."
246,2020-04-05 06:01:24,fv644w,"You would think being made out of abilities, the dragon could do more. But it didn't. Just pew pew pew"
247,2020-04-05 13:24:13,fv644w,"I love that you hit on the soundtrack and opening. Deadly Drive is a great song imo, and I love the animation for the opening of the movie a lot. And the OST was golden. 
Please tell me I’m not the only one who was so confused about the whole “creating a singularity” with the crystals and Dazai’s ability? And then Shibusawa is killed, but resurrected again? Literally anything during and after that part had me so out of it."
248,2020-04-05 21:17:06,fv644w,"The movie was overall good, from the soundtrack, to the animation, to the character interactions and all. What dragged it down for me was Shibusawa himself. He is by no means a terrible villain per say, but he could've also been something much more. From his motivation being pretty unclear and flip flopping between wanting to find the perfect ability, to him just being bored and doing things for the shits and giggles, it's like the movie couldn't decide, to him acting like a mustache twirling cartoon villain that gets his assed kicked despite his massive ego. He just didn't come off as much of a threat, especially when Fyodor and Dazai were outsmarting him the entire movie, despite him apparently being one of the most intelligent people to ever live with a IQ of 300 or something.

Honesty, the fact that Shibusawa's motivation was so convoluted kinda baffles me, considering that most, if not all BSD villains have a pretty straightforward motivation. Akutagawa wants the acknowledgment of his mentor, Fitzgerald wants to revive his dead daughter and heal his mentally ill wife, Fyodor wants to rid the world of abilities and sin, thus creating a utopia, Sasaki wanted to take revenge on the Agency for the death of her husband, Rimbaud wanted Arahabaki's power and so on. I don't even need him to sympthatetic. As  Aaron Ehasz himself states in his tips for character writing, the focus should be more on making the character fascinating and compelling, rather than likeable or sympathetic. And that's what Asagiri for example nails with someone like Fyodor, who Shibusawa should have been more like, rather than what he turned out to be. Since it's clear that Bones were going for the genius criminal mastermind character type with him but fell short in the end.

It doesn't help that Fyodor usurps Shibusawa's position as the main villain during the second half of the movie, making Shibusawa nothing more than a puppet. He just really gets screwed over by everyone, which makes him less of a threat, and that's not a good thing for a villain. Not to mention that his connection with Atsushi is never properly explored, even though there was a big opportunity for it and could have made the movie even more interesting. Basically what I'm saying is that the movie should have focused more on Shibusawa, making him the singular threat, and not being a part of a villain duumvirate, since in the end, it's Fyodor that stole the show. Also, a clearer motivation.

What would have been even better is if the movie focused on the first Dragon Head Conflict which lasted for 88 days. Bones had more than enough material to work with in order to make Dead Apple about that, telling us how it started, how and why Shibusawa got involved, since we know that he was called by the government to stop it, but not why him in particular, and whether he was a government employee. Was he a part of the Special Operations Division ? It could have detailed how he ended up using the ensuing chaos in order to create his own criminal syndicate and intensify the conflict. Another missed opportunity.

I kinda get why some of the other characters were sidelined, which I don't mind, since considering how huge the cast of BSD is, there's just no way they could have fitted everyone in just 1 hour and 30 mins, which is how long the movie was If I'm not mistaken. It's been some time since I've last watched it. The pacing was fine for the most part. In fact, it was kinda faster than I expected, since the movie wasted no time getting into the action. It didn't even bother with a recap as many people assumed that it might of had.

Overall, maybe the movie should have not necessarily been set in the present and after the Guild Arc no less. It's especially jarring in the anime when Dazai refers to the fight with the Guild as their biggest fight yet, when Dragon Head Conflict 2.0: Electric Boogaloo happened not long after, with a dragon threatening to buttfuck not just Japan, but the entire world. Probably one of the reasons why there's still a huge debate on whether Dead Apple is even canon.

Also, Akutagawa vs his own ability was the best fight scene in Dead Apple in my opinion, and was much more entertaining than watching Chuuya bash a dragon's head with a skyscraper as cool as that may have looked.

Sorry for the incoherent rant, but it's something I needed to get out of my system and I'm also a bit tired."
249,2020-04-05 05:18:47,fv644w,"Interesting. At the time of watching it, I thought it was really great as a whole. I specifically remember loving the pacing. I'll have to rewatch it."
250,2020-04-05 13:27:42,fv644w,Yeah. I don't get that bit at all
251,2020-04-05 23:31:03,fv644w,I mostly agree. I just really wanted to see more of the  characters fighting their abilities and teamwork that there wasn't as much of for a series centered around a team of good guys
252,2020-04-05 05:48:16,fv644w,I mostly just wrote this because I felt the Movie could have connected with the characters more. Just personal preference
253,2020-04-05 23:41:01,fv644w,"I understand. One of the biggest complaints about the movie that I've heard outside of the fact that Shibusawa was a weak villain, was the fact that the other Agency members got very little screen time. 

It would have been nice to see all of them make their way to the tower, and having to fight their abilities as a team, since the series has put a big emphasis on how the Agency is much stronger when they are together.

Hell, that's pretty much outright stated during the Decay Of Angels arc in the manga by Atsushi, and we see the results of what happens when the Agency gets divided."
254,2020-04-05 23:44:25,fv644w,"Two movies would have been nice, one dedicated to the ADA and the other to Shibusawa, only problem being that Season 3 would have had to have come out in between them."

267,2020-03-31 04:28:43,fs39w4,This is really truly amazing! The one critique I would have is that her nose is slightly off center from her lips. It is difficult to draw just half the face though!

297,2020-08-11 03:38:58,fs39w4,That's a really good drawing. Can I ask did you draw it with the face of the edge of the page like that to avoid dealing with the symmetry of the face? I had trouble with that for many years. Even if your slightly out it makes the drawing look 'wrong'.

324,2020-08-14 05:39:41,fs39w4,"Hey, first of all thank you! I made it half for a few reasons.
 I wanted to do a full version at first but didn't have the time and energy to constantly add detail to the dreads, drawing hair a lot I knew if I did the full portrait and I wanted it to look as perfect as I possibly could get it, it would take me forever.

Secondly, I personally think it's a more striking image, the 'audience' can pay attention to all the small details and if it was a full piece it would detract from the minor details which I want people to notice. 

Lastly, and MOST IMPORTANT I dont free hand, I use a projector to trace. The I do all the details and shading myself. I have a huge issue with 'perfecting' so to help ease my nerves when drawing I just trace the outline. I know it's frowned upon, but I make my artwork for myself first. Then share with the world. 

Also, I reckon if you do have trouble drawing a 'full face' and you try over and over to learn and it ain't working for you, see if you can compose your images differently where you don't always have to include a full face."

344,2020-05-01 21:42:19,gbo08n,"It's a good idea to have both a warm red and a cool red on your palette.  Cool reds tend to make better violets, especially when mixed with a blue that is close to red-violet on the color wheel, like Ultramarine Blue, which is a blue-violet.  Cad Red Lt is a warm red compared to the other two reds you are using.  Cad Red Lt is really a red-orange on the color wheel; the other two reds you have are closer to just red.  Cad Red Medium and Deep are roasted longer when processed, so are duller colors - Deep is almost a brick red.  Make yourself a little color chart with your reds to see their true nature when you add white (tint to three values), and when you add black (shade to three values).  Also good exercise to make a spectrum hue green (match your color wheel green) and chart your reds to a couple of values with your green mix.  Many times, you need a touch of white to pull what looks like a brown to a gray . . ."

What makes me cringe is that noone calls it the 'red line'. Its just a tenuous effort to brand align this with Prada's logo. It's the central line and one does not enjoy boarding it."

403,2020-04-30 03:13:40,gale3v,"in seriousness, willow and jaden reflect really well on Will's parenting skills- imagine hearing your kids mumbling pretentious nonsense, yet you can still encourage them to do their own thing without worrying that they will embarass you publically. And resisting the urge to laugh at them."
404,2020-04-30 03:10:40,gale3v,"Yeah... this is lame, but does anyone else find it even more cringey how much people on Reddit like to hate on Will Smith's kids?"

Willow and Jaden Smith are both like this. They make up these arbitrary phrases out of 100 dollar words and act like they’ve came to the most profound conclusion in human history. 

Granted, each are artists in their own right. Not taking anything away from the success they’ve had though I’m sure it helps to have one of the most famous people *in the world* as your dad. Shit, their mom’s an A-list celebrity too. But god, they say the dumbest fucking shit."

remember how will and jaden [started their own brand of recyclable water bottles](https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2018/08/27/Will-Smith-launches-Just-Water-in-the-UK)? that really sucks!

jaden might have some strange fashion choices but he has shown that he is a good person. even if all of this is just for publicity, at least he is doing something. to lump all of their children together is being ignorant.

522,2020-04-30 20:53:20,gale3v,I'll do you in the bottom while i'm drinkin sangria.
523,2020-04-30 05:21:52,gale3v,"Damn, how'd you get out of that situation??"
524,2020-04-30 05:08:56,gale3v,"""Commercials 4 Hobos, a new revolutionary way of sharing your SELF!""

Who wants to invest?"
525,2020-04-30 05:40:54,gale3v,"For real I thought it was gonna be a whole ass singing video, Like that Jessie J subway singing video.. Except I felt that one was done with a bit more humility/self awareness."
526,2020-04-30 16:18:41,gale3v,That's made in Bangladesh 1/100 of the selling price
527,2020-04-30 21:20:23,gale3v,"This is London, yeah? One of the cities with highest concentration of rich people in the world."
528,2020-04-30 15:04:25,gale3v,I don’t understand how one of the most charismatic (and yes I stand by that) actors of all time could produce such black holes of charisma and likability.
529,2020-04-30 20:30:18,gale3v,Lolll
530,2020-04-30 19:54:21,gale3v,His anime on netflix wasn't half bad either.
531,2020-04-30 23:20:03,gale3v,"Both have actually released pretty decent music, there's definitely talent there."
532,2020-04-30 22:24:36,gale3v,The wailing must have been especially awful. They only showed like 1 second of it.
533,2020-04-30 17:38:09,gale3v,Give me 15 minutes on iMovie and I could make something more creative than this
534,2020-04-30 16:06:07,gale3v,I love that movie.  Directed by Elizabeth Banks!
535,2020-04-30 17:20:54,gale3v,he’s kinda cool and self aware now. just fyi
536,2020-04-30 15:22:18,gale3v,Truth is his music is actually dope but alright
537,2020-04-30 14:19:02,gale3v,I think they just started them too early to pull it off. Everyone thinks their own kids amazing. Most people aren't interested. Maybe if they had been more mature when they tried it wouldn't have been so cringey and forced.
538,2020-05-01 06:30:43,gale3v,"Jada should take the bulk of the blame. Have you seen her interviews? She doesn’t hide her jealousy that her husband is a global celebrity, while she’s barely even a household name."
539,2020-04-30 01:19:52,gale3v,jaden has started a free vegan food truck for the homeless and a recyclable water bottle brand. don't lump them all in together.
540,2020-04-30 07:54:24,gale3v,"considering how smart will smith is, I'm having a hard time finding out where the fuck he might have went wrong"
541,2020-04-30 13:19:49,gale3v,Damn you are jumping to a lot of conclusions
542,2020-04-30 03:12:10,gale3v,Who hurt you?
543,2020-04-30 17:34:58,gale3v,Jaden smith is 21 years old.  Willow is 19.  Stop.
544,2020-04-30 12:35:36,gale3v,"Good point, I guess I can give them credit for at least trying. 

I think what happened with the smith kids is that Will and Jada probably gave them nothing but positive feedback for every little thing that have done since birth. They think they’re geniuses because that’s literally what they have been told since forever."

546,2020-04-30 20:14:00,gale3v,Yeah I fuck with his music

548,2020-04-30 14:27:52,gale3v,I’m da fireball is so cringe
549,2020-04-30 01:18:34,gale3v,"I know this is you, Jaden"
550,2020-04-30 01:33:08,gale3v,You can be charitable and talentless at the same time.  Giving to the needy isn't a talent.  People aren't trashing him as a person... they are just saying he isn't as talented and artistic as he spent a lot of time trying to be.  He's perfectly suited using the family fortune doing philanthropic shit like this and people appreciate it.
551,2020-04-30 02:10:37,gale3v,"Yeah, when you're wealthy you can afford PR"
552,2020-04-30 12:37:23,gale3v,"Don’t know why you are getting downvoted, thanks for sharing, your post is really informative. 

My original comment was geared more towards them as artists than people, you can be a good person and still a terrible pretentious artist."
553,2020-04-30 01:16:01,gale3v,What is wrong with jaden? He looks like he is dying
554,2020-04-30 00:45:42,gale3v,Must be!
555,2020-04-30 13:08:58,gale3v,None of this would’ve happened if Tupac hadn’t died
556,2020-04-30 05:15:27,gale3v,I'm gonna need something more than your say-so on all of those.
557,2020-04-30 03:26:44,gale3v,"I wondered what you would know about being in a cult, but then I saw your username and it made sense."
558,2020-05-01 17:37:47,gale3v,That would actually perfectly fit - well done.
559,2020-04-30 01:58:37,gale3v,Shall I .... do another one?
560,2020-04-30 12:02:03,gale3v,Yeah they cut out of that shit real quick.
561,2020-04-30 01:04:06,gale3v,Unless they were tricked they had a say in what they said. If they gave up control over their image for wealth that's even more cringy
562,2020-05-02 11:11:51,gale3v,Reminds me of the singer that go heckled on here from his opening alone.
563,2020-04-30 01:12:57,gale3v,"They clearly approved the ad. So maybe, I’m spitballing here, they could have not put it in the final cut."
564,2020-04-30 06:44:03,gale3v,Or maybe arrogant enough to bend reality to brand-align London and a 120 year old tube line to suit them.
565,2020-04-30 01:10:09,gale3v,"Uh... I am pretty chill dude. Did you read the other comments? Was just responding to that... 

Thought reddit was for sharing and discussion, crikey."
566,2020-04-30 15:19:35,gale3v,Richard Jenkins was the star of that movie..he was fucking hilarious
567,2020-04-30 21:05:45,gale3v,"Nachos, lemonheads on my dad’s boat.."
568,2020-04-30 05:38:54,gale3v,"I cut off everyone I knew and got clean in some forest town where nobody knew me. I had to basically re-learn how to not be a shit human being— a total life reboot if you will.

Then I worked my ass off so I could upgrade from tunnel hobo to mcdonald’s trash corral hobo to an average car hobo! :D"
569,2020-04-30 05:23:03,gale3v,I'd be better than investing in one of will smiths children
570,2020-04-30 20:50:53,gale3v,All to create a spontaneous moment of deep appreciation of revolutionary artistry and the collective human spirit. Beautiful.
571,2020-04-30 21:29:07,gale3v,I don’t think those people are riding the subway much
572,2020-04-30 16:57:39,gale3v,"The difference between Will Smith and his kids is their upbringing. His kids grew up in the lap of luxury. Will was born and raised in west Philadelphia. He spent most of his days on the playground, chillin’ out, maxin’, relaxin all cool. He’d shoot some b-ball outside of his school. There were guys that were up to no good and would make trouble in his neighborhood. He got in a fight and that scared his mom so she sent him to live with his aunt and uncle. It’s a story about how his life got flipped-turned upside down. It’s a real rags to riches story."
573,2020-04-30 15:21:21,gale3v,Maybe because Will Smith isn't that charismatic and is actually just... acting.
574,2020-05-12 14:54:50,gale3v,Or...really expensive and talented producers!
575,2020-04-30 22:40:18,gale3v,I am picturing slow-mo abstract shots of a turd falling upwards into an upside down toilet bowl.
576,2020-04-30 23:43:50,gale3v,where may i see that
577,2020-05-01 01:23:08,gale3v,His music is pretty bad but he seems like a cool dude nowadays
578,2020-04-30 16:08:47,gale3v,"yeah he makes some pretty decent music, no idea about Willow but Jaden has talent"
579,2020-04-30 01:26:15,gale3v,"That has nothing to do with talent or being dull. No one is saying he’s not a good person, yet for some reason you keep taking these comments personally on his behalf."
580,2020-04-30 01:26:53,gale3v,No one fucking cares.
581,2020-04-30 18:19:48,gale3v,We all could start those with unlimited money as well
582,2020-04-30 04:00:47,gale3v,"Honestly, the Jaden Smith album that came out about a year ago wasn’t terrible. I wouldn’t seek it out, but I didn’t hate it"
583,2020-04-30 02:01:27,gale3v,Ok Karen...
584,2020-04-30 16:39:20,gale3v,What makes you believe he’s smart?
585,2020-04-30 14:06:04,gale3v,"Well I’ve unintentionally kept up with their careers, it’s just my opinion from what I’ve seen."
586,2020-04-30 03:15:06,gale3v,"Haha I just get mad at pretentious entitlement that’s all. 

Do you not see anything wrong with the video?"
587,2020-04-30 18:39:32,gale3v,"What has Jaden done in recent years that warrants him being labeled ""dull and talentless"".  He's made some questionable tweets in the past and some shitty videos sure.  But all things considered I think he actually seems like a pretty charitable and decent dude.  If you don't like his music don't listen to it.  No need to attack him.

I agree this video is cringey but the comment above just seemed unnecessary."
588,2020-04-30 22:19:32,gale3v,"Yes. They are still kids. You dont stop being a kid until after you can rent a car, 25."
589,2020-04-30 17:01:08,gale3v,"Bruh, “wait a minute” is a vibe. Deal with it"
590,2020-04-30 23:17:51,gale3v,Wow that was terrible. I was thinking more like Time Machine or 5
591,2020-04-30 01:20:01,gale3v,well you got me
592,2020-04-30 01:59:59,gale3v,"I didn't mean to argue that he is talented, I don't know too much about that side of him to be sure. it just seems like the person above wants to bash them as a person"
593,2020-04-30 02:17:05,gale3v,"completely missing the point. the point is that no matter if this is done for publicity or nah, they are doing something good. unlike what these comments imply. I'm not arguing he has any talent because I don't know about that, I'm just saying he isn't useless or ""just a rich kid"""
594,2020-04-30 15:33:38,gale3v,well that's reddit you know? make a good informative post and people interpret it the wrong way and you get downvoted. lol

604,2020-05-01 07:14:41,gale3v,You think wrong. People of all classes ride the sub.
605,2020-05-02 16:58:18,gale3v,"You'd be surprised, the traffic is so bad in London lots of wealthy people take the tube too."

609,2020-04-30 16:15:14,gale3v,"Couldn’t you say that about any part of someone’s personality? “Maybe they aren’t actually nice. They’re just acting nice.” 

...What?

I’ve watched his vlogs, and I think he’s a genuinely entertaining and personable guy. Even though those vlogs are obviously marketing material for his family “brand,” he’s still the most likable aspect of anything his family does."
610,2020-04-30 17:29:59,gale3v,I feel like Will Smith is just being Will Smith in a lot of movies.
611,2020-04-30 16:14:02,gale3v,Imagine thinking will smith is one of the most charismatic actors of all time. Ive never enjoyed him in a movie
612,2020-04-30 03:12:21,gale3v,"I mean, assuming his words were ghost written, we at least know Jaden can dance too."
613,2020-04-30 08:08:56,gale3v,"He's not a good person.

He's a spoilt little shit who never heard the word 'no'"
614,2020-04-30 01:50:20,gale3v,"Fair enough. Then I'll say:

I liked his album. Good production, good vocals, used well. He just has to work on his lyrics though, they are meme-worthy sometimes.

For example: [U](https://youtu.be/rVLW7tyhp1E) is pretty good."
615,2020-04-30 02:02:00,gale3v,"I didn't mean to argue that he had talent, I'm not sure on the talent part. it just seems that the nature of the comment was implying that the smiths are useless and haven't done anything, which I was trying to point out jaden has"
616,2020-04-30 02:00:13,gale3v,super epic
617,2020-04-30 05:32:13,gale3v,The homeless who get fed probably care
618,2020-04-30 04:21:30,gale3v,Willows music is pretty good imo

620,2020-04-30 17:39:39,gale3v,A dummy couldn't defeat Loveless and his mad weapons.
621,2020-04-30 18:49:47,gale3v,"Fair point, I kind of assumed cause he's been very successful"
622,2020-04-30 20:50:00,gale3v,I wasn't really trying to attack them as people so much as I was venting about being subjected so much to one family's shameless self-promotion and mediocrity.
623,2020-05-02 00:45:13,gale3v,"This is /r/cringe. As someone pointed out on another comment about people mocking people to an obscene level, a lot of the users probably don’t feel that good about themselves and therefore seeing others be cringey is a good way to reflect that self hate."

628,2020-04-30 06:38:13,gale3v,"Look, I found it cringe that Prada thought it'd be a good idea to pay Willow Smith to do embarrassing shit on something called the ""red line"". I think my tone makes it sound like I didn't find it cringe, which wasn't my intention. It is super cringe. 

I guess I cringe more that this was all approved at a meeting and they thought it be okay to call the Red line cos it makes London that lil bit more Prada.

Different strokes for different folks I guess! No biggie."
629,2020-04-30 06:29:03,gale3v,"I'm confused. I just gave my two cents as to why I think it's cringe and someone says ""stfu"". What am I missing?"

You can have the hobo ending and level up to becoming a cushy bus/vandwelling hobo. 

Or you can re-enter society and work up to a room or studio apartment. 

I was literally days away from the first one before the ‘rona happened (and the person selling the van backed out). But still very close to leveling up nonetheless :3"

637,2020-04-30 17:02:46,gale3v,"There it is. Because at the end of the day, Will Smith is all of the talent and charisma in his family."

639,2020-04-30 16:29:29,gale3v,Imagine thinking your personal opinions and biases attribute to someone's abilities. I've never enjoyed someone thinking that.
640,2020-04-30 02:19:27,gale3v,well I completely forgot he was a rapper. I just found some of his songs again and they turned out alright. guess he isn't exactly talentless anymore

642,2020-04-30 10:47:11,gale3v,"Nah not the Smiths...

I think it's pretty clear that people are saying that these celebrity kids are talentless and they are only getting attention due it their fathers name.  

I guess it's a matter of opinion"

666,2020-04-30 17:04:54,gale3v,That's funny because you are the one making a statement on ability due to preferences. You thinking he is really bad does not make him thus. This whole conversation could have been avoided if you had said that you don't enjoy his acting.
667,2020-04-30 22:22:43,gale3v,How TF is Will Smith supposed to be more charismatic than Tom *fucking* Cruise?
668,2020-04-30 03:02:34,gale3v,what’s bad about his music?
669,2020-04-30 15:32:07,gale3v,"again, my original post was not trying to argue that he had talent. I was trying to say despite the lack of talent he isn't useless and deserves at least some praise.

I thought his attempts were alright? how does that equate to me thinking he has no talent? got dam"
670,2020-04-30 03:10:26,gale3v,"Nah I know what sub I’m in. I deliberately visited it. I don’t think it matters whether or not it’s a cringe sub because most reddit communities needlessly shit all over Will Smith’s kids regardless anyway. 

I mean, people still judge Jaden by one dumb tweet he made like 8 years ago when he was 12 and in my opinion that’s just petty and really unfair because he was a fucking child. 

What’s even more dumb is those same people not realizing that kids eventually grow up and mature"
671,2020-04-30 03:24:46,gale3v,"Hey I get it. It is. But this is like the hundredth time I’ve seen Will’s kids get relentlessly hated on and their characters needlessly disparaged just because they happen to be privileged. I mean, imagine yourself being an 11 year old Jaden and making a dumb (but totally harmless) “pseudo deep” tweet once and still being defined by it as a young adult"
672,2020-04-30 03:25:18,gale3v,I remember an article somewhere about Jada and Will being really concerned about his health and pleading with him to eat meat. I don't know if that's true. I just remember seeing something in the last six months or so.
673,2020-04-30 17:28:42,gale3v,Oh I thought you were the guy I was talking about? The guy i responded to said will smith is one of the most charismatic actors of all time and I was bringing light to the fact that thats subjective and he should put I think before it. Not really sure why you got involved lol but do you bud
674,2020-04-30 03:16:42,gale3v,For me it's that everything I can say is positive about his music could come from anyone with money and the parts I dislike are his. I.e. lyrics and stylistic choices. Example: goku
675,2020-04-30 03:23:24,gale3v,"Why are you taking this so far? This is a video, and this is how people reacted to that video, the end."

678,2020-04-30 18:34:10,gale3v,"He's almost certainly anorexic (I say this as an ex-anorexic myself).  Hearing Jaden talk about how he only eats one meal a day and sometimes ""forgets"" to eat even that are so painfully obviously the words of an anorexic person.

It really fuck's me off that Will Smith staged an intervention and tried to get Jaden to stop being a vegan.  A lack of meat has fuck all to do with Jaden's health issues.  It's a lack of food, period.  More people in the world need to go vegan/vegetarian, but here's the Fresh Prince to the rescue, to add to the problems that the meat industry causes to the world's pollution problem (not to even mention the ethical issues)."
679,2020-04-30 19:14:05,gale3v,"> his music could come from anyone with money

Except we know this isn't the case: see Rebecca Black and Willow Smith in the same family."
680,2020-04-30 03:21:09,gale3v,I’d argue that surrounding himself with producers and engineers who are able to handle everything still has to do with his talents as a taste maker. musicians with huge budgets have made terrible music before (Eminem’s past couple records come to mind) so I think taste and style play a HUGE role in an albums production. and he has been shown to be a pretty tasteful and ambitious artists in that sense in my opinion
681,2020-04-30 03:27:33,gale3v,Because I’m slightly drunk currently and might get a little passionate about stuff that isn’t too big of a deal in reality  lol
682,2020-04-30 04:14:23,gale3v,No idea. Didn't care enough to read past the headline so take that with a grain of salt.
683,2020-04-30 22:02:36,gale3v,"Thank you so much for the feedback and point of view. It was strange to me that he would stage an intervention and try to get him to eat meat because there are SO MANY perfectly healthy vegetarians and vegans. They have no issue with getting nutrients. 

I had a feeling that it might be anorexia. I'm sorry that you went through that, but so proud of you and happy for you that you came out the other side okay."
684,2020-04-30 20:12:26,gale3v,"Just because it didn't doesn't mean it couldn't! hahaha

And it's also worth noting that I'm not saying to dislike anyone or anything like that. This isn't an objective topic.

..admittedly I like a couple of Willow's songs, though I view it similarly to Jaden."
685,2020-04-30 08:14:20,gale3v,"You could argue that but it doesnt really change my point.  It's still jaden throwing around dad's cash. Additionally it's not like he could only attempt to work with a single producer,  he can just not use whatever he dislikes."
686,2020-04-30 03:33:30,gale3v,"Lol, now that I can relate to."

great"

716,2020-06-18 19:39:18,hbkada,"Your natural shape is close enough that it could be made more like those example noses you like. Like the other comment mentioned, make sure to find someone who specializes in ethnic noses because it makes a big difference!"
717,2020-06-18 18:52:47,hbkada,"You’re very pretty.

I am not sure what you mean by help you, but it is absolutely possible to transform your nose to the examples you provided."
718,2020-06-18 21:06:40,hbkada,"I think your nose is beautiful. I’m curious what you see wrong with it? May it be because it’s not a stereotypical European nose? I wouldn’t change it if I were you because your nose is small and cute and it suits your face, but, of course, that’s your choice to make ❤️"
719,2020-06-19 00:14:48,hbkada,"As another comment stated, your nose is already very similar to the celebrity ones you posted, so I think this is very realistic and would beautifully fit your face while maintaining your ethnicity. Be sure to check RealSelf, I find that there is more advice on surgeons who specialize in surgery for those who want to maintain their overall ethnicity on there."
720,2020-06-24 01:00:14,hbkada,"You are beautiful already to be honest, but having surgery is a personal thing, if you feel you need to get something done, then you should go for it."
721,2020-06-18 19:10:22,hbkada,Are you mixed blasian? I think you could benefit from a slightly higher nose bridge definition while keeping your overall natural shape.
722,2020-06-18 19:07:58,hbkada,"You’re very nice to say that, thank you...

I guess what I meant by help is whether or not my appearance would benefit from a rhinoplasty and if my hopes and expectations were realistic. I’ve tried editing my nose in faceapp before, but because of the shape of it (my nostrils are wide and pinched and the tip is bulbous), the edits always come out very weird, which has me worried.

I don’t want a caucasian looking nose, I just want it to be slimmer/dantier."
723,2020-06-18 21:25:59,hbkada,"That’s really sweet of you to say; thank you so much... <3

Yes, that’s definitely apart of it— I’ve been made fun of for the size of my nose in the past and told I’m “pretty for a black girl,” which just makes me feel bad.
So, I always wanted a smaller nose because of this... More than anything, I just want to feel confident and happy in my own skin. :)"
724,2020-06-18 19:17:32,hbkada,"I’m not mixed with anything, but thank you for the advice! Would a higher nose bridge definition cause it to look slimmer, too?"
725,2020-06-18 19:41:16,hbkada,"So much is subjective, right?

And the person’s opinion that matters most is you!  

A talented plastic surgeon should be able to easily slim your nose.  That’s their job.  And given that your nose is absolutely perfectly normal, it shouldn’t be that difficult to accomplish.

Make sure you do consults with PS that do have experience with ethnic faces."
726,2020-06-18 21:53:40,hbkada,"I’m always down for people making changes to feel confident in their own skin, but it upsets me that it’s partly because of a Euro-centric beauty standard. I have a Middle Eastern nose (prominent ridge and bump in my nose) so I know how it feels to not have a dainty white nose. But I have to tell you...You’re not pretty *for a black girl,* you’re pretty PERIOD. And people who say otherwise can kick rocks. Do what makes you happy, but do it for you...and black is beautiful ❤️"
727,2020-06-18 19:22:58,hbkada,Yes you have a really cute button nose. Try googling which doctors would specialize in ethnic rhinoplasty while retaining natural features.
728,2020-06-18 22:18:50,hbkada,"I completely agree, I really wish I didn’t feel this way; I’ve wanted to accept myself as I am for several years, but it is difficult when you don’t even come close to fitting a single standard of “common” facial beauty. Reading this honestly made my day, though. I really appreciate you!! Thank you💓"
729,2020-06-20 00:13:57,hbkada,"You guys are aware that there are millions of people who are not white who have tiny noses... right? Like this is bs I’ve seen more white peoples big noses than Turks lmao edit: I don’t mean this in a bad way guys, there are millions of white peoples who have great noses but like stop saying it’s Eurocentric .. it’s not."
730,2020-06-18 19:27:28,hbkada,"Wow, thank you :) I definitely will look into that! Thanks so much for the advice"
731,2020-06-18 23:46:18,hbkada,"I agree with the above, I think you're beautiful! Those pictures of Willow and Rhianna are both insanely photoshopped - and they both have their make-up done by a professional make-up artist in them, hence why they look near perfect. It's hard to not compare yourself to photos like that in a society like ours, but I think you ARE a babe! At the end of the day, if you decide to go through with the rhino for yourself because you know it will make YOU happier, by all means, give yourself that gift!"
732,2020-06-19 04:39:55,hbkada,"Also chiming in to say that I think your nose is really beautiful for your face. I love how it looks on you. I'm not saying that to discourage you from doing anything that makes you happy. I just wanted to chime in since you're soliciting opinions. I totally understand the struggle to accept yourself though, because I hate my own nose and really struggle to appreciate my own looks."
733,2020-06-19 21:06:31,hbkada,"Thank you so much. Reading the comments in response to my post has made me step back and think about why I want to change my face. I might still end up looking into rhinoplasty if I continue to feel this way a few years down the line, but I’ll do my best to continue trying to accept myself and focusing on more important things until then... It’s comforting to know that people can relate. I hope that you’re also able to cope with your struggles. :)💓"
734,2020-06-16 22:50:37,haemkb,"I'm white but I don't feel privileged at all.

I have no opportunities in life really since i'm poor as fuck.

I'm a drug addict.

Police have targeted me because you can actively tell that I'm an addict like you can see it in my face.

I guess my only privilege is that I haven't had to deal with racism but I've had to deal with discrimination of different sorts like because I'm poor, because I'm a druggy, because I'm ugly, because I'm a faggot ( gay ) , because of mental health, because of anorexia etc;

I personally feel like yeah white privilege is a thing I guess but mostly only to white people whom are middle class and above you know?"
735,2020-06-16 22:47:51,haemkb,This really picked my brain. I hope you’re doing alright
736,2020-06-18 21:50:56,haemkb,"Through the years, I have discovered a few way to handle issues like this. First, anyone who says that your feelings are invalid or selfish is wrong. Second, people seem to love throwing around the word racist in an attempt to smear a person. The person being smeared loses what I like to call good social standing because now that person has a mark against him/her. There is not much you can do in this situation, but I would recommend not apologizing. No matter what, people will see an apology as disingenuous and disbelieve it. Third, you did not choose your skin color, gender, sexual orientation, heritage, or a host of other factors that make you who you are. You did not choose your ancestry or anything that happened in the past. It is dead and gone. All we can do is try our best to make it in this crazy world.

It's not often that people will actually look at a whole person and form opinions based on that. The truth is, no matter who we are, we have problems, regardless of any perceived benefits that genetics bestowed upon us.  All human lives matter. Do not stress so much about what you are going to say to someone who is different from you. Unless you are attacking or threatening the person, you need not worry. In fact, treating them in a special way might make it worse because that could be misinterpreted."
737,2020-06-17 03:55:55,haemkb,">I guess my only privilege is that I haven't had to deal with racism

I mean, that's white privilege. It's moreso that your race doesn't affect your day to day life as opposed to automatically being privileged because you are white."
738,2020-06-16 22:58:19,haemkb,"Yeah I understand I'm not rich either I live off of benefits and cant get a single job to help my mum (since I'm only 15 and no one wants 15 year olds to work for them) I hope that you can fix your addiction and that life will improve for you I really do, you seem like a really nice person."
739,2020-06-16 22:49:22,haemkb,I mean I'm doing the best I can but a lot keeps happening and I'm struggling to keep up with everything. But thanks for the concerns.
740,2020-06-18 22:20:28,haemkb,"Thank you for this it actually kinda helped. Just to be clear when I mean I panic talking to people of other skins I never really treat them differently it's just I'm constantly self conscious of saying something that will offend them or make them think of me in a negative light. I do my best to treat everyone the same and as humans because that is what we are and feeling like you dont belong to that ""category"" is a horrible feeling to have. Again though thanks for this."
741,2020-06-17 10:39:05,haemkb,"Yes I understand that bro that's fair enough (:

But at least right now in my life and in my opinion of course as it's different for everyone the only thing I don't get called the N word, so yeah that's a privilege but since I'm part of all these other  disadvantaged groups of people I'm discriminated against because of that, and at least to me it seems to outweigh the privilege of not being discriminated against because of my race.

I get what you mean tho you're probably right as I suppose that my situation would be a little worse if I was also black but to me I feel like it wouldn't be that much worse, it would be a little worse I'm sure but because of my personal situation already the difference would be minimal but still apparent so yeah you're right really(:"

Great research btw.  Thanks for putting that together"
756,2020-06-15 21:50:11,h9gyvq,"When the MP3 and Napster busted onto the scene, it was the beginning of the end of big revenue for the music industry since people were just going to pirate songs instead of paying for them.  Also, people who still pay for music could just buy the songs they want for $1 each instead of paying $5 for a CD single.  

Because of this, a lot of different types of music died off because the music industry was only going to invest money into music that actually made money.  That's why we only see music from artists like Katy Perry and Justin Bieber.

When the music industry had the money, they could pour money into music that didn't sell well like Gangster Rap.  I never liked Gangster Rap and I never understood the appeal where practically every song involved slapping up bitches and doing a drive-by.  Well, a lot of people didn't like Gangster Rap either because that genre died off after the MP3 destroyed the music industry.  

So the music generes that are almost non-existent today are Gangster Rap, Anarchist Punk and Devil Worshiping Heavy Metal and they died off because the actually sucked and were being used instead to send negative messages and propaganda to the masses which worked for a long time until the the MP3 showed up.

This is the reason why the movie industry is very litigious and will go after anyone barely infringing on their trademarks and brands.  The Deep State doesn't want to lose their propaganda arm called Hollywood."

If you truly want to know and stop forming random conspiracies join us at r/Freemasonry and then head to your local lodge and put an application in. 

You'll understand why we keep it a secret afterwards. There's anticipation and suspense during the rituals that when complete makes you feel like it was all worth it. I always compare it to a movie. Would you rather see a movie after you've been told all the spoilers and parts that are hard hitting or would you rather see it with a fresh mind not knowing what's about to happen and enjoy it that way?

Netflix and the Grand Lodge in England did a great job giving insight. I don't gain anything by saying what's in it is not legit.

848,2020-06-18 13:24:07,h9gyvq,"No. You have us confused with Thelema 😂 those guys maybe seek demons and wierd rituals. R/Thelema a group based on teachings from Crowley who took the mystery and fraternal style of Freemasonry and created his own version.

We do not worship any particular God. Religion is NOT discussed in lodge neither is politics in any sense of the word. Each mason must believe in a higher power, but Satan worshipping is not welcome. Whether you're Muslim, Christian, Catholic it doesn't matter you are welcome. 

The entire premise of Masonry uses allegories. The best way I can describe is a beautiful system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols. We do not have special God's or sacrifices in open lodge. This goes directly against members personal religious beliefs. 

Now, there are groups similar to Freemasonry that often get MISTAKEN for Freemasonry. Across the US there's plenty of fraternities with different rituals, degrees and systems. There's Oddfellows for example which has nothing to do with Masonry, yet some of their content has got mixed into ours. 

I understand people with general fear of not knowing what goes on. I was exactly like you in my curiosity and skepticism but after joining I realized none of it was authentic and in fact I genuinely enjoy myself on a monthly basis."

We initiate to keep tradition of what's always happened. The purpose was basically to welcome you into the fraternity and all it has to offer. 

Most fraternities require some form of initiation. Even the Catholics who have their own Fraternity called the Knights of Columbus have an initiation. 

The only differ in initiations within Freemasonry is that Prince Hall Mason's (Typically African American Centric Lodges) have different segments than typical lodge. I haven't been apart of a Prince Hall initiation yet, but it's on my bucket list when I go to Boston."

As for the whole,black people commit more crimes thing, ok let's say that's right, have you even considered why that is instead of just regurgitating facts and seeing that as law? Maybe its because black people are disproportionately more likely to bepoor than white people generally. Maybe its because they are poor that they have to participate in illegal activity which makes them commit more crimes and since they are disproportionately more poor they'd probably be in the same community which would explain your black on black statement. Maybe also being poor puts them in cheaper schools and not having access to private schools which would naturally hinder them on the education front as well. And since schools are based on property taxes, lower propertied areas,where black people are probably because they are disproportionately more poor, are getting less funding in the first place. So any response to that or what. 

Also I've seen statistics on crimes in the US before, it was like done in the 2003s but if I remember correctly white people are more likely to,if we are using statistics like you are as an end all be all,  commit arson,molestation,and incest among a ton of other things; white people had a lead in pretty much everything accept theft,robbery and like breaking and entering so.....see how that's stupid to go off of statistics face valued."

Let me tell you a good analogy I heard once. Let's say a kid gets hurt on a playground, and that kid represents all of black lives. The BLM movement wants to give that kid a bandaid because that kid is hurt. What all lives matter does, is that it gives the black kid a bandaid not big enough to cover their area of pain, but it also gives a bandaid to another kid who didn't get hurt. That kid being white lives. So what I'm trying to say is that white lives aren't hurt but black lives are, which is why we should say black lives matter instead of all lives matter."

I know that all lives matter has good intentions, but it doesn't do anything to make change. It doesn't educate people on the struggles that people face for their race and it doesn't attempt to change anything. The blm movement is at least trying to cause change for the better.

The source I was responding to:  https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/21/police-kill-more-whites-than-blacks-but-minority-d/ https://rosebyanyothernameblog.wordpress.com/2020/06/02/watching-violence-in-black-and-white/



Here's an interesting discussion of a similar accusation, from a far less suspicious source.

https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/08/police-officer-shootings-gun-violence-racial-bias-crime-data/595528/

The findings of one report state that

> Many people ask whether black or white citizens are more likely to be shot and why. If you live in a county that has a lot of white people committing crimes, white people are more likely to be shot. If you live in a county that has a lot of black people committing crimes, black people are more likely to be shot.

So a similar argument to yours, just more rigorous. When adjusting for violent crimes, things aren't so simple.

However, there are some really questionable approaches

> The vast majority—between 90 percent and 95 percent—of the civilians shot by officers were actively attacking police or other citizens when they were shot”—and that there were more white civilians who were committing such attacks when police killed them than were African Americans. In fact, white people were more likely to be armed when police killed them, as Cesario’s study acknowledges—“if anything, [we] found anti-White disparities when controlling for race-specific crime,” reads the study.

So effectively, they see that killed white people are more likely to be armed, and instead of judging that cops have a higher threshold for responding to white people with deadly force, they determine that...there's an anti white bias?
Then there's past research:

Justin Nix examined in his 2017 study on police killings. Nix’s research, which Cesario cites often in his own study, also focuses on police shooting-killings in 2015, when police killed nearly twice as many white people that year (495) than they did black people (258). But 15 percent of the black people police killed that year were unarmed, compared with just 6 percent of white people who were unarmed when killed by police. The study also found that 24 percent of African Americans and 32 percent of other non-white racial groups were not attacking police officers when they were killed, compared to 17 percent of white people. This was interpreted as “preliminary evidence of an implicit bias effect,” against African Americans and people of color.

So in fact, both of these studies have determined that independent of crime rates, going into the very specific confrontation between police officer and individual, cops are more trigger happy with unarmed black people than white people

Now back to your crime rates.

The person who addresses the numbers you cite says it himself, in that first linked article:

> “The data doesn’t indicate which shootings are justified (the vast majority) and which are cold-blooded murder (not many, but some). And maybe that would vary by race. I don’t know, but I doubt it,” Mr. Moskos said on his blog.

In the context of the data I just brought up, that seems pretty fucking significant, doesn't it?

Meanwhile, that second study is very, very weak social science. Looking at national rates with only the broadest yet shallowest eye for context.

And again, this is a tiny subset of the issue. The fucking prison complex, which is an extension of slavery, for one thing, and that creates the crime problems you attribute mass shootings to.

TL;DR: Looking at crime rates is a shallow attempt at providing context that ignores the actual conditions of individual shootings. With the limited data we have, it appears that the black people, despite higher demographic crime rates, are targeted more heavily and indiscriminately."
1117,2020-06-05 11:25:04,gvvtzd,"Freedom to use a platform does not necessarily extend to bullying and slurs. In fact, it doesn't extend to anything the platform doesn't want. This website has rules. Given that the website is boosting a person's message, demanding a website include everything a person wants to boost on it is a restriction of the free speech of a private entity.

 Moreover, what, are they free from being shamed for their shittiness because ""freedom of speech""? That's not how this works; you can be held culpable by other people, if not the state. If you're asking me to not share those screenshots, I might as well call it a violation of my right to free speech.

Finally, your country's freedoms are looking a lot more fragile right now than they once did. But that's in part an issue of optics; the abuse of police authority to restrict speech and restrict assembly has long been abused, particularly to target PoC. Which raises another interesting question: who does this ideal of ""free speech"", curated as it is officially and unofficially by the status quo, benefit?

> There is no black man, there is an american

I know what you are trying to say with this message, but if we say american instead of black american, then we are dismissing the fact that police brutality tends to attack black people. I want America to be at a point where the race of a person doesn't matter when it comes to this, but it isn't their yet so it's important to spread awareness about what race that person is so people can be aware of how often police kill certain races.

>Black people are not discriminated by cops

Black people do tend to face discrimination from cops more frequently than white people. My dad, for example, got pulled over to do some sort of drivers license check because that's a cop's job. You can easily tell that my dad is hispanic by the color of his skin. So the police checked his license and said ""is this one of the good ones?"" By that, the cop is implying that my dad got a fake license. My dad doesn't have any criminal record of any sort, so it's very likely that the cop said that to my dad because of race. This is just a minor case that involved no violence. Police tend to be much rougher when arresting poc than when arresting white people. A quick search on youtube can show many videos of police being more violent to black people than to white people when arrest.

>When many police lives are lost, are you going to protest for their lives.

I would be sad if the police died innocently, but I don't think protest would be necessary because there would be a ton of news coverage if a cop died and the murderer would be given a fair sentence. Police also chose to be police while black people didn't choose to be black. If a cop finds their job too dangerous and wants to leave it, they can. If a black person fears for their life, they can't just become white.

>You are saying alllivesmatter just doesnt focu on black lives matter.

Many people who say all lives matter tend to be against the black lives matter movement and think that protests are unnecessary. I know that all lives matter includes black people, but black people need more attention than white people because there are many people who don't think that black lives matter."

1160,2020-06-10 14:05:04,gvvtzd,"A better wording would be that black people take up 50% of the jail population. The reason I say this is because black people are fat more likely to be innocently convicted. Cops are also up black people's asses when it comes to making sure they follow the law, whereas white people don't get as much attention from the police. Black people are 10 times more likely to be innocently convicted over white people, and are also likely to get longer sentences than white people who did the exact same crime. Since cops tend to monitor black people more, it's more likely that every single black person that did a crime will get convicted for it (plus other innocent black people) whereas it's a bit easier for a white person to get away with crime. There is racism in the justice system which causes more black people to go to jail.

Also, just because 50% of the jail population is one race, doesn't mean that black lives don't matter. Black people would be in jail less if the world wasn't so mean to them which then causes mental health problems in then, which then leads to a higher chance of being incarcerated."

1166,2020-06-10 16:47:44,gvvtzd,"1: I have not seen any person that's a part of the BLM movement that wants division between the races. BLM was created to eliminate white supremacy. 

2: Police brutality does exist towards black people, as it does to other races but more to black people. The protests are protesting all police violence in general, but black lives matter is used because more black people are innocently dying than any other race. Even the original post has a ton of black names of people that have died and quite a few of them being people under 20. Not nearly the same amount can be found for white names. 

3: I understand if it's for self defense, but many black people are getting killed innocently. For example, Trayvon Martin was a black boy who was holding a bag of skittles and police shot him. The cops say that they mistook a bag of skillets for a gun. The police probably wouldn't have thought that it was a gun if Trayvon was white. Also, police tend to abuse their power and kill people for reasons that aren't logical. Not all but many do this. Police should aim for less lethal areas of the body. 

4: Black people do commit more crime, but not much more than is thought. It's easier for a white person to get away with crime than a poc. Poc also tend to be convicted innocently ten times more often, which is why the prison population is more black. A reason why black people tend to commit more crime is because of red lining. This is something done by mortgage leaders or people that work in city government where they grab a map and draw a red line around specific neighborhoods or parts of the city. Red lining was first made when there was still more racial injustice, and it would mainly attack the neighborhoods of poc. Red lining is used to deny services like giving city sections less tax money to fix things. This then results in all the surrounding areas being more poor which includes schools. Since schools in those areas aren't good, many people that attend those schools get a worse education and  are more likely to drop out of high school. This lack of education means more likely to get a bad job, which then means less money, which then means more likely to commit crime to gain more money.

5: The BLM movement and the ACAB movement does not believe that every single cop is a racist person. It believes that the police system encourages racism by telling cops to look out more for black neighborhoods that have a high crime rate. This makes sense, but since they are focusing on a neighborhood with a high crime rate that is black, they are more likely to associate crime with black people. Which is why police pull over poc more than white people (which is a fact and studies have been done to prove this).

6: I don't mean that in every day life black people need more attention. What I meant is that police discriminate against poc more often, so it needs to be talked about more often. When a white person gets innocently killed, of course it needs to be talked about. But the cop is more likely to face a fair sentence, whereas the cop who killed George Floyd got charged with 3rd degree murder (manslaughter aka accidental murder) when he should have been charged with 1dt degree murder. Once everyone sees black people equally and once they don't face as much discrimination, then it won't be necessary to talk about the injustices they face since they wont be facing any. But currently they do so it needs to be talked about.

I know you have good intentions when saying all lives matter, but all lives matter was started to dismiss the problems that black people face. Obama said something along the lines of ""black lives matter doesnt suggest that no one else's lives matter, what they were suggesting was there was a specific problem going on in the african american community."" And that's exactly what the BLM movement aggres with. People say black lives matter because it represents that black lives are more at risk. With this logic, that would mean that the all lives matter movement thinks that every single race's life is equally at risk. I'm not sure if you agree with that, but just wanna make sure that you are aware of the reason that all lives matter was created."

I don't know anything about your country, but in the US white people aren't opressed (specifically for being white- that's the important part.)

1182,2020-06-10 17:26:36,gvvtzd,"I'm pretty sure black lives matter was only focused on one race because if there's a movement that talks about every single race and their injustices, then that would be too much information for the public to handle, and no one would care about it. I don't think that the movement or the founders can be blamed for it getting political. At the moment the black lives matter movement can be seen as dividing because of the name, but it actually wants to inform about the struggles of black people. I personally do not use all lives matter because it doesn't explain any injustices that any races face, so many people might be ignorant to the struggles people of other races face. It's important to inform about the struggles of other races, so that's why I support black lives matter. If all lives matter would actively inform people of the struggles that every race faces, and would do something to help, then I'm almost certain that everyone would support all lives matter."
1183,2020-06-10 17:39:55,gvvtzd,"Alllivesmatter does not ignore the struggles, but it brings all struggles together. It is to counter black lives matter, but at the same time it supports black issues.(real ones, not police brutality which is Grade A anticop bullshit) You are repeatung your same point, yes it informs black issues, but everyone else is completely forgotten. Focus on the big picture. David dorn was a black police officer killes by looters, his death was. an ijudtice but black lives matter never covered it. black lives matter only covers white on black, that is it. There are way more pressing issues that the black community has that black lives matter doesnt cover. Black on black violence, welfare, and many more issues prevent the Black community from becoming more successful. I understand your good intentions, but you are the wrong movement. Alllivesmatter includes everyones true issues. This brings people together."
1184,2020-06-10 18:56:02,gvvtzd,"All lives matter isn't making an attempt to make change, whereas black lives matter is. And police brutality is a real problem, because many black people fear walking about and getting arrested by a cop which is something that white people don't fear. Saying that police brutality doesn't exist even though there is evidence of it doesn't make sense. People of the black lives matter movement are well aware of the other issues that black people face whereas people of the all lives matter tend to not be as aware because it isn't discussed as much. People of the BLM movement want other people to be aware of all the issues black people face and talk about it a lot, whereas many people I know in the all lives matter movement don't believe in white privelege. We want those issues that black people face to be solved as well as the police brutality issue. Black lives matter does cover all those pressing issues that you mentioned, but you can only really hear about it if you've done research on everything that the BLM movement stands for. I think that it's messed up that BLM didn't cover David Dorn, but news people think that looters and protestors are the same group of people so it might make it seem like protestors are the ones killing cops. Thank you for educating me though."
1185,2020-05-28 18:52:54,gsc5wd,"A for effort 

Tough read though"
1186,2020-05-28 19:16:35,gsc5wd,Didn’t Bradman have an eyesore of a technique that would look totally wrong in today’s game so almost no one would replicate it? Sachin seems the total opposite to that
1187,2020-05-28 21:09:52,gsc5wd,"Totally pointless seeing as there's almost no high quality footage of Bradman and almost nobody alive could have watched him play.

More to the point, these lists are insane. You've got Gower and Graeme Smith right next to each other. Could hardly get less comparable players."
1188,2020-05-28 19:44:57,gsc5wd,"Apparently Bradman had a back and across movement and did a twirl of his bat in the air just before the bowler bowled his delivery. Quite unorthodox for the time, but it didn't hamper his effectiveness

Agreed on how by contrast, you could watch Sachin bat all day."
1189,2020-05-28 23:00:28,gsc5wd,"Bradman himself said he thought Tendulkar most resembled him, and when you see footage of both playing a cut shot or anything off the pads you can kind of see it. Both have great fluidity through their shots.

But Bradman was known to move around the crease and rotate the bat before deliveries, basically trying to stay in motion so he could both react quickly and use momentum in his stroke play. His technique in shots is textbook, it's his pre delivery routine that looked odd."
1190,2020-05-28 20:54:28,gsc5wd,He played some unorthodox shots for sure. I recall seeing one slog he played like a baseball drive straight down the ground but he looked fantastic playing 'normally'.  The very light bats used I think accentuated the use of the hands.
1191,2020-05-29 07:50:52,gsc5wd,Sounds like Amla
1192,2020-05-25 19:20:31,gqh4ps,"Another big thing I'd address is something both unmasked Rhino and Turtle made mention to - it seems that performers aren't allowed to choose whatever song they want. Rhino noted that he wanted to do more pop songs, but the producers pressured him into doing the country songs he's not exactly well-remembered for; Turtle stated that he was unable to do some songs he wanted to since the producers only allowed one ""high energy"" performance per episode, thus forcing him to do more ballads. While this does make sense in some circumstances (say, someone would do a song someone else already did or was planning to do), it feels like masks are being increasingly pigeon-holed into their ""roles"" (for example, Rhino as the country singer and Turtle as the heartthrob). Masks should have MUCH freer rein over the song selection process."
1193,2020-05-25 19:13:15,gqh4ps,"I agree with most of your argument, save for the “live voting” portion. If voting is swapped from studio audience to live, the competition shifts from talent based to celebrity based, and the meaning of the masks is lost. People will just vote for someone because they love the celeb under the mask, not because they were decent that week. I think a decent compromise could be made, like offering voting for a bonus element on After the Mask or something, but otherwise I fear that the mask part is taken away."
1194,2020-05-25 20:07:50,gqh4ps,"I disagree with the live voting, I think it’d become a popularity contest by then because the people at home figure the contestants out very soon, so you would no longer be voting for Turtle, for example, you’d be voting for >!Jesse McCartney!< and this is why I think giving the judges 50% of the votes (especially by the finale) is a problem. Night Angel is very talented, but I do think it is an advantage when half of the judges know who you are and you’re friends with them and they have that much power in the voting. Jenny and Robin knew their friend was under the mask by the finale (Jenny’s admitted to voting for her friend earlier in the season). Not saying that they were being bias and voted for her because we don’t know if they even voted for her, but I think it is an advantage at least."
1195,2020-05-26 02:24:47,gqh4ps,"I've read people's comments about how biases will come into play if live voting is implemented & totally understand them. That being said, the judges have far too much control over who wins & it's impossible to say they're not biased at all.

If a vote split is 2-1-1 it makes it difficult for the contestants receiving 1 vote to win & that's with a ONE vote advantage. If the panel vote is 3-1 it would require a landslide audience vote to win and that's with a TWO vote advantage.

Even if you just did a 33% split between the panel, audience, & viewers it would be heavily influenced by each individual judge. You would still have millions of viewers with the combined influence of FOUR people. However, this would at least be a step in the right direction and prevent panelists completely determining the winner each season."
1196,2020-05-25 20:17:48,gqh4ps,[removed]
1197,2020-05-26 01:28:44,gqh4ps,"I'd like to add that having Jenny McCarthy sets a VERY dangerous precedent as she's the author of an anti-vax book.  Giving her the answers makes her look ""smart"", therefor she's obviously correct when it comes to anti-vax.  We're in a global pandemic, it's really the worst time to be promoting an anti-vaxer."
1198,2020-05-26 02:18:12,gqh4ps,"Live voting is impossible. 

With the studio audiences, they can film the whole season quickly and effectively avoid conflicts with other commitments.

Nobody who can reasonably pretend to be a celebrity can make a weekly appearance on the show for several months while balancing their career and maintaining secrecy."
1199,2020-05-25 20:19:08,gqh4ps,Ok but Shane Dawson would actually be a really good judge! Or even just fiance Ryland!
1200,2020-05-25 19:21:49,gqh4ps,"This!!!
Turtle also said he the producers tried to pressure him into doing songs similar to Frog did at one point...Wonder if Frog initially wanted to do something else but couldn’t."
1201,2020-05-25 20:59:08,gqh4ps,"Wow, really? That’s so ass-backwards and detrimental to themselves (the producers)."
1202,2020-05-25 19:52:58,gqh4ps,i mean yea i agree but some songs have licensing issues. notice how there were no Michael Jackson songs or James Brown songs which i think a lot of celebs wanted to do. also i understand not wanting him to to do high energy stuff when others are doing high energy. since he can do both. the fans don’t wanna see all high energy songs (i do) but i understand. for example when NA did “How to Love” and Rhino did his ballad the other two did high energy songs which makes perfect sense
1203,2020-05-25 19:35:02,gqh4ps,"I just want to clarify that with my ""live voting"" suggestion, I meant that the celebrities/singers won't be unmasked until the following week. Therefore you will still be voting for the best performance without knowing who exactly is under the mask. The audience along with viewers at home will still be voting based on the performer's talent. I'm not sure if this exactly resolves what you're talking about, but I hope this helps."
1204,2020-05-25 20:23:31,gqh4ps,It’d also be very hard to get celebrities to agree on the live voting due to their busy schedules
1205,2020-05-25 20:13:25,gqh4ps,The judges definitely shouldn’t have that much control over the outcome.
1206,2020-05-26 08:26:18,gqh4ps,"Yeah Jenny knows a ton about pop culture. Been around for a long time. If Ken can guess Barry zito Jenny can too. 

She also can deliberate with her husband on sports at home."
1207,2020-05-26 05:24:30,gqh4ps,"Isn’t that the YouTube dude who got shit cause he claimed he had sex with his cat?

I highly doubt a network would put him as a judge just based on that."
1208,2020-05-25 19:23:18,gqh4ps,"I was going to mention that! Maybe Frog DID want to do something like ""Smooth Criminal"" for the finale but got vetoed by the producers..."
1209,2020-05-25 21:00:54,gqh4ps,That's what we all thought.
1210,2020-05-25 20:18:48,gqh4ps,"Fair, licensing can be an issue. But still, the producers shouldn't be telling masks not to sing songs because it'll upset whatever balance they have."
1211,2020-05-25 19:36:26,gqh4ps,"I get what you mean, but the thing is the internet usually has a way of figuring out the masks by the second performance, tops. I don’t think there’s any way to prevent the brigading of fans to the show unless you cut out the clue packages entirely; which would ruin some of the show’s appeal."
1212,2020-05-25 19:47:10,gqh4ps,"The thing is: people won’t. You’d like to think their voting for the best singer. But really, once they figure out one of their favorite celebrities is under a mask, they’re going to power vote them through to the Finale. It’s just how it is. 

Also, live voting has been heavily discussed by the producers, but they put the idea off the table for a variety of reasons. Saw this in an interview with a producer."
1213,2020-05-26 17:36:32,gqh4ps,"It was fake! He used to have a very shocking sense of humor and he really regrets it now. 

If they will let ""I don't vaccinate my children!"" Or ""I wrote a date rape song and cheated on my wife."" Or ""my most famous role involved me being completely nude."" On the panel, then they can let a really nice person who used to make shock humor jokes on the show."
1214,2020-05-25 19:23:52,gqh4ps,"I hate the idea that the show markets itself as a way for celebrities to reinvent themselves, yet they don’t have the liberty to make their own choices?"
1215,2020-05-25 22:46:09,gqh4ps,well they probably say that cus either 1. it’s better for them to have more versatility through the night 2. some can be licensing issues
1216,2020-05-25 19:43:05,gqh4ps,"I agree that live voting would probably lead to voting for certain celebrities and not the masks, but the problem is that already happens, we know for a fact that Jenny has voted for certain masks after figuring out who they are because she likes the person underneath."
1217,2020-07-04 04:33:29,gqh4ps,"Yeah so this didn't age well. 

I'm sorry for defending Shane. I'm not gonna delete this because I want to show that people can change their opinions based on new information. Shane is Gross and I was dumb for not seeing it sooner. I'm so sorry for supporting him at all. I hope nobody sees less of me for my previous support but if anyone does I understand."
1218,2020-05-25 19:25:56,gqh4ps,"It's like ""hey come on you'll do new things!"" and when you try to do said new things the producers are like ""no, we said new things that we approve"" which is ???"
1219,2020-05-31 00:17:51,gqh4ps,"The producers seem to have gotten stricter as far as song choice.

Last season Adrienne (Flamingo) said she could sing anything she wanted with the producers making suggestions."
1220,2020-05-25 19:45:00,gqh4ps,"I think Jenny just really liked NA, I don’t think it was at the forefront that she thought it was Kandi."
1221,2020-05-25 20:03:14,gqh4ps,"But the judges voted only add up to 50% of the total score. The audience still matters here, but if you add in the live votes then 100% of the votes are based on bias."
1222,2020-05-25 19:27:39,gqh4ps,I just hope season 4 let’s the masks do what they want. We got robbed of some good performances because of the interference (yesterday an unmasked Turtle did a livestream where he said he wanted to do Hailee Steinfelds “Starving” instead of “Stay” but couldn’t because it was a ballad and Astro was doing one) so I’m hoping they back off.
1223,2020-05-25 19:46:00,gqh4ps,"Yeah, but I’m pretty sure she admitted that she voted for Banana after figuring out it was Bret Micheals"
1224,2020-05-25 19:29:54,gqh4ps,"I wonder if s1 and s2 had similar issues as well... to be entirely honest I'd love to see a redo of s3 where everyone's allowed to do whatever they want, but that won't happen so the next best thing is, well, stirring enough shit to get FOX to back off of the singers' choices."
1225,2020-05-25 19:47:50,gqh4ps,Huh... when did she say that?
1226,2020-05-25 19:30:38,gqh4ps,Exactly. We can’t change the past but hopefully we can make a change for the future seasons. FOX has a great concept for a show but sometimes the execution is wack.
1227,2020-05-25 20:14:40,gqh4ps,"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KTBzK3dybaM (0:52) it’s possible that she just thought he was the best, but I think knowing your friend is under the mask is an advantage even to the most unbiased person"
1228,2020-05-25 19:31:54,gqh4ps,"The concept is Korean originally, so they didn't even get that! I do like some of the new things FOX did such as the clue packages, but..."
1229,2020-05-25 20:16:35,gqh4ps,"Yeah... she should get fired for admitting that... under any context, even if she knew he was Bret or if she was just a fan of Banana. Their votes play such a big role, and that lowered tone of voice that she said it in, she knows she shouldn’t have said that."
1230,2020-05-25 19:32:31,gqh4ps,"That’s what I meant haha. But yeah, if they just made the show feel a little less heavily scripted imo that’d do a world of good."
1231,2020-05-25 20:21:45,gqh4ps,"Banana was one of my favorites and I like him more than Kitty overall and people have their own opinions, but to me, he clearly lost that Smackdown against her, so it’s a little hard for me to believe that she thought he was the best."
1232,2020-05-25 19:53:34,gqh4ps,"That, and more mask interactions..."
1233,2020-05-25 20:02:16,gqh4ps,Definitely need more of those.

1283,2020-06-30 17:14:59,hiq3gj,Wow what a story 🙁
1284,2020-06-30 18:22:18,hiq3gj,He’s a pervert and needs to be taken off the internet like he’s said about so many other people. It’s so hypocritical it’s disgusting.

1288,2020-07-03 06:53:27,hiq3gj,"Thank you. Oddly I hadn’t seen it on Twitter, annoyingly the drama around him seems to have died down the last couple days and he’s not trending anymore except alongside Tati and Jeffree for the James drama last year.

I really believe he only did that insta live video about tati’s apology to try and detract some attention away from these allegations"
1289,2020-06-30 01:10:23,hicuz1,Can you link those threads?
1290,2020-06-30 01:39:33,hicuz1,"You should link those threads here and on the Shane thread on r/beautyguruchatter, a few  drama channels read on there"
1291,2020-06-30 01:51:04,hicuz1,This is ripe for abuse. Do people remember last year when James Charles was falsely accused on Twitter? Everyone should just cool their jets for a second.
1292,2020-06-30 02:15:27,hicuz1,"[https://twitter.com/misshemlock/status/1276728253177139202](https://twitter.com/misshemlock/status/1276728253177139202)

[https://twitter.com/woacbofficial/status/1276896992350867456](https://twitter.com/woacbofficial/status/1276896992350867456) This last thread is just proof that he was actually talking to teenagers on Tinychat, though I'm sure most of those videos have circulated on Reddit by now. He does say some pretty weird shit to them, even if it's indirect; it's just stuff you should absolutely never say in front of children."
1293,2020-06-30 02:23:50,hicuz1,"I can totally understand where you're coming from, but James Charles was never in the unique position of having extremely vile content that could potentially validate the accusations against him floating around the public sphere. Because of everything that's currently being unearthed, I think it's worthwhile for people who had questionable interactions with him to re-examine those moments. And when you read the stories, it's pretty difficult to A). Imagine that these women are lying, or that Shane WOULDN'T behave in the manner they're accusing him of, because we've seen him do worse in his old videos, or B). Deny the inappropriateness of said situations due to the girls' ages at the time."
1294,2020-06-30 02:30:06,hicuz1,"Shane is absolutely at risk of being falsely accused, despite whatever fucked up things he has said before. The two are not mutually exclusive. I think it's best we all acknowledge that reality.

edit: And people absolutely took Tati's & Jeffree's words, James's jokes towards Grayson, and his own self-professed love for straight boys as incriminating evidence."
1295,2020-06-30 02:52:55,hicuz1,"It's complicated. On the one hand, I can understand the need to protect him/not have a repeat of what happened to James Charles. On the other hand, I had weird interactions with Shane when I was about 13, so I'm less inclined to deny the validity of the above stories. But hey, this was all 10+ years ago, and I'm just some girl on the internet. Again, it's complicated. 

That being said - no one, if you'll notice, is accusing him of rape or something inconceivably graphic. What he occasionally said or did to us was supremely inappropriate, sure, but I don't think Shane is a monster (not in the way that people tried to say that James was). These are just women who are re-examining past interactions with him and adding to the larger conversaton we see unfolding.

The way I see it, we're beginning to see patterns emerging that, again, simply were not present in James Charles' ""cancellation."" But these things deserve to be talked about. These stories are valid and worth consideration, especially given the reality that NO ONE is considering them."
1296,2020-06-30 12:38:19,hibluw,"Phil is usually so adamantly against people who hurt or joke about hurting children but this one... He glossed over this. I'm confused. Shane only took down his blackface merch a few days ago. He said the old apologies sucked but he did the same one again and kept contradicting himself and he blames his issues, again. Do better.

(For anyone curious to learn what went down [somebody simplified it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eXYamDgU7lUzn6NB9B_HWPUphnJgenlMqxoSgHNcNx4/edit) and Smokey Glow on YouTube makes some excellent points)"
1297,2020-06-30 00:00:29,hibluw,"I've started taking a shot every time PDS covers Shane Dawson/Jeffree Star/James Charles drama, but even that game just isn't fun anymore.

Is there actually significant demand in the Nation to warrant mentioning these people twice a week? I can't tell if Phil has just been sucked into some bizarre YouTube algorithm black hole that keeps promoting these topics, or if it's me who's wildly out of touch.

Either way I'm more and more looking for other channels for daily bits of ""news"". This just isn't relevant to me."
1298,2020-06-30 03:23:51,hibluw,"I’ve found it annoying when he covers “news” that involve minor controversy amongst celebrities on social media and cancel culture. I can’t tell when he’s either hopping on the bandwagon or is actually interested and wants to share convos about the topics he brings to the table. 

Often he’ll cover a topic involving outrage towards a person for something pretty pointless to draw more attention to. He’ll bring up Twitter statements and tell us where the people stand on the subject and he often ends it with “my thoughts on this... idgaf this is silly” I wonder how much power the audience sending him topics has on the PDS. 

Also, I find it amusing that he’s praised Shane in the past numerous times for his content and has dubbed him one of the great youtubers whilst knowing his problematic past. I guess Phil really is into the beauty (tea) culture..."
1299,2020-06-30 20:18:06,hibluw,I wish he would cover the whole FBE thing. I'd be more interested in his opinion on that than Shane.
1300,2020-06-30 00:29:44,hibluw,"This time it's warranted. It's now on the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/style/shane-dawson-jeffree-star-youtube.html). Even before the Smiths called him out on twitter, Shane's content on sexualizing minors going viral was worthy of commentary or at least coverage. I can understand if Phil didn't know or had blinders on because they are friends. 

But the last time similar controversies it got brought up Defranco helped reform Shane's image and swept it all under the rug. And Phil called the first one a [witch hunt](https://youtu.be/W4DnmTEHQug) and the [other a ridiculous made up shock story](https://youtu.be/jXiMRecJHHk). Guess everyone had to see the videos and photos to believe it themselves."
1301,2020-06-30 21:23:45,hibluw,"I can't find a source so take this with a grain of salt, but Phil has mentioned that he consults for youtubers sometimes and he definitely worked with Shane in the past (I think Phil let it slip in a video when there was some controversy a few years ago). A lot of us viewers think he promotes Shane because, the better Shane does, the better Phil does."
1302,2020-06-30 00:04:45,hibluw,"Phil seems to go on a pattern.  He covers YouTube entertainment news, world news, local US news, controversial news, and then the stuff that interests him.  It’s random which topic he covers but in a given month, each topic seems to be covered equally.  Major topics (like covid) being the exception.

It may be we notice these more than the others because we expect the others.  Usually it’s the stuff we don’t expect that gets highlighted."
1303,2020-06-30 01:03:22,hibluw,"I feel that this is still different from a lot of other similar stories though. Frankly I'm surprised that Shane lost any subs from this. Is there anyone who has follow Shane to any degree since the earlier days that was surprised by any of these revelations? I haven't followed him for several years now but I did watch some of his stuff way back even if I don't remember a lot of it. There's not a whole lot that could be ""exposed"" from those early days that I wouldn't respond with ""yeah that sounds about right."""
1304,2020-06-30 08:43:06,hibluw,"These people make good thumbnails so even if they aren’t a big part of the episode either they’re often very noticeable. Compared to world news which is hardly ever thumbnail material.

 Plus he’s been having so much trouble with suppression covering real stories, wouldn’t surprise me if that subconsciously pushes him to less intense drama stories sometimes"
1305,2020-06-30 01:11:02,hibluw,"The part that he changed channels and content gained him new subscribers like me who was unaware of his past, at least not to this extent. 

His old fans are sharing stories how they didn't realize it's fucked up because they were still in middle school when they first started watching Shane. Even during his meet & greets and Tanacon his fans were mostly underaged girls. People didn't process it until much later."
1306,2020-06-30 17:27:26,hibluw,I think this is very likely a logical explanation for the current situation
1307,2020-06-30 01:20:21,hibluw,"Oh shit I forgot about the channel switch, fair point. Looks like he's removed just about everything from the original channel too."

1330,2020-06-28 22:58:15,hhnooh,"Well said. I’m also having a hard time processing everything happening. I have been watching Shane since 2008 when I was 9. If only Shane and those around him recognized there was a serious issue, this may not be happening. Shane really needs professional help dealing with his childhood trauma and coping mechanisms. As much as people think Shane sits in self pity, I think there’s actually a lot of things Shane is afraid of addressing in his life. I say this because I can relate in that sense of avoiding dealing with traumatic events. Some things are easier to be open about and deal with than others. I really hope he gets help since I still care about him, he’s a human being just like anyone. It’s a sad situation and I feel for all that are negatively affected by his online presence."
1331,2020-06-29 05:20:42,hhnooh,[deleted]
1332,2020-06-29 08:49:14,hhnooh,"I’m the same age and found Shane the same way. I would come in and out of his channels every once and awhile and was always surprised at how different they would be every few years. 

I think Shane has always been a youtube gymnast of sorts? He’s constantly bending himself to fit into what is appealing to the 12-14 year old audience and that of course changes every few years. I do think the original gross-out and being shocking is his true personality and humor which is why I’m not shocked about his pedo/racism comments- not because I think that’s okay- but because that’s ALWAYS been the core of his humor even if he’s bending to assimilate into a different teen audience of the year. 

I think Shane and 2020 teens are just simply incompatible. 14 year olds of 2010 and 14 year olds of 2020 are SO different. He simply can’t bend himself anymore to appeal to the audience he’s always chasing. 2020 youth has no patience for the content that was “okay” in 2010 and lord knows you can’t hide it from them. 

It’s ironic that his graveyard girl documentary was all about how she needed to evolve and change to keep her appeal. And here we see Shane has bent himself as far as he can, but the jig is finally up for him, he can’t run from his past. It’s time for his retirement."
1333,2020-06-29 04:09:12,hhnooh,God bless that Bojack clip. So incredibly relevant
1334,2020-06-28 23:18:40,hhnooh,"I was watching his Draw My Life video and confronting dad and mom videos to get more insight on his childhood. Shane’s father played a huge part in Shane’s perception of reality and sense of humor. With being bullied, abused by his dad, and his dad leaving he’s been constantly trying to fill a void. He ate constantly to feel something. Once he started on making skits people were laughing with him and not at him, he clung to that. For the first time in his life he felt accepted by people. It’s gotten to the point that he’s still filling that void and skirting around the root of it all. He holds so much pain and trauma from bullies that he’s taking people constructively speaking to him as bullying because he’s lived with a victim mindset for so long. His feelings of inadequacy should not be projected by inappropriate humor that’s at the expense of others. What he needs is some intensive therapy like exposure therapy so he’s forced to face his destruction head on. He should be ashamed and horrified that his old grossly inappropriate content was viewed by age groups he made disgusting jokes about."
1335,2020-06-29 06:08:35,hhnooh,Oh good god. I couldn’t imagine a 9 year old watching him back then.  I was older when I found his channel back in 09.  At the time I thought he was funny but definitely really crass and disgusting and was really hoping his audience was older like me... but here y’all are. 😞
1336,2020-06-29 05:33:41,hhnooh,What exactly happened in the Jenny Craig situation?
1337,2020-06-29 09:41:31,hhnooh,"I linked his apology video from 2 years ago regarding the pedophilia rumors in an edit above. 100% agree that he’s trying to appeal to the younger crowd and they can see through his facade. Like when we were in middle school (when he was first starting) crude humor drew us in. Every creator was into clickbait shock value videos, the 13-17 demographic at the time ate it up. With society becoming more PC we evolved into the mindset that “inappropriate jokes” at the expense of others isn’t okay. Shane teamed up with Jeffree because teenagers nowadays love quality makeup and they already were hooked on Shane’s conspiracy videos. He really found his niche with them 3 years ago. I did a little digging and his older brother Jerid’s YouTube content is primarily conspiracies. Honestly, if Shane decides to retire he has more than enough money to keep comfortable. Also, what pisses me off is his exploitation of Graveyard Girl, Bobby Burns, and Eugenia Cooney. Bunny and Bobby’s careers fell apart after Shane. [Shane talks shit behind Eugenia’s back during multiple instances. ](https://youtu.be/Y-pitodEaOc) He cannot be trusted and is frankly two faced."
1338,2020-06-29 04:35:57,hhnooh,When he blamed his trauma for his crude and disgusting jokes it reminded me of this scene where Todd’s done with Bojack’s excuses. >! Bojack ends with him getting cancelled in the end of the series and loses everything. So I find the comparison even more fitting. !<
1339,2020-06-29 06:19:54,hhnooh,"You read him so well. 

He thrives off self-pity and that's his version of remorse. That if he feels sorry, that doesn't make him a bad person right? And it echoes with the people defending him atm. That it should be enough that he it wasn't his intention. 

Except most people don't consider themselves bad people because they always have a justification inside their heads. And that's what Shane does when he apologizes and thinks feeling guilty makes him good and absolves the harm he has done. It doesn't. 

He needs to start watching his old videos with a therapist and a friend to truly reflect  on his past. He cant keep escaping it and siphoning off his morals through how other people react. It shouldn't take someone to say ouch or get a bruise for him to realize he has hurt people."
1340,2020-06-29 13:17:27,hhnooh,"Lmao my dads died when i was 16, my sister is autistic transgender and violent, my mother encouraged my eating disorder, and of course I was bullied at school for being fat... and yes I used to make crude jokes. But never did they pass the threshold that shanes did.

Granted ive gone to therapy for 7 years now... but there are people with situations worse than mine or his who turn out fucking fine.
They don’t use racist jokes to mask their past....

As a kid I never saw anything wrong with his humor. I was 11.... a young age to get into shit.

Looking back Shane robbed me of my childhood in a sense. I ran around like an animal dropping F bombs like nobodies business....

But the one thing that still shocks me, was even how wild I was then, I never once thought saying the n word was ok... by any standard.

When I was 14 I was STRONGLY an activist for LGBT (still am). I am an ally. 

Even then, whenever kids would make racist jokes at my friends I would stand up for my friends.... (i grew up in a predominantly white area) 

It shocks me how I would just brush off his content and say “ya those jokes are wrong... but that’s just shane”. Even at 14 years old I was more mature than him in the fact not to indulge in such jokes....

Now 20, I am saddened by the fact I still even watched his content for so long. Of course I fell off the bandwagon for a bit (2014-2018), and then the Tanacon thing hit and I was hooked.

I viewed shane as “grown up” and maybe it was just because of his appearance. He still made crude jokes. 

But now older, looking back on everything... it’s just. There are so many warning signs.


Shane needs serious help. And the whole “he’s still a person too” argument whatever. He is.. and he needs help. But he’s never EVER been held accountable. He’s acting like he is right now, but he’s not. 

He just tries to wallow in self pity of “i had a horrible childhood. Boohoo im just the mentally troubled millionare”...

He needs help. But he also needs a slice of what did he call it “humble pie the size of the empire state building”. And make sure to add a dash of reality for the icing."
1341,2020-06-29 10:03:06,hhnooh,I turn 25 a day after Shane’s birthday this year. It does horrify me that impressionable minds were desensitized to disgusting jokes. Most of it went over our heads or we related because immature gross humor was funny. If I was the same age I am now back in 2008 I would be uncomfortable and be creeped out by him. I also worry about the people my age and under who became traumatized by his content.
1342,2020-06-29 05:45:15,hhnooh,[deleted]
1343,2020-06-29 09:58:46,hhnooh,"Agreed, he needs to be psychoanalyzed and the therapist needs to have him try to justify his old behavior. While he’s matured and changed, his humor is still dark but now he self depreciates himself. I read it as someone who also went through bullying and trauma. You could say I have a dark sense of humor but I knew my boundaries. I had a destructive victimization complex and once I acknowledged that, I broke free from the mindset. It was refreshing that a majority of things wrong in my life were caused by me. I started taking accountability for my actions and have had a better mindset since. You can’t live your life by playing the victim constantly and Shane has. He needs to realize that he’s not a victim, he caused it by his actions. By doing that he needs to address everything problematic in his career and not deflect it to trauma. That’s a crutch mechanism to enable the victim behavior."
1344,2020-06-29 13:23:06,hhnooh,"I used to use the “pity card” as I call it. Whenever anyone would cross me, I’d just act as if I was superior for going through more “life experiences”. Like “oh my dad died and my sisters a violent autistic transgender with serious developmental issues”. And dont even get me started on my mom haha.

But if I was ever losing a fight I’d just throw that shit at people. And win everytime.

As I started studying argument and rhetoric... the “guilt card” is actually a logical fallacy. Not exactly called the “guilt card” but it’s the same general idea.

As I got older, I realized that just because bad shit happened in my life, doesn’t give me an excuse to get whatever I want and be a dick to people.

Clearly Shane still has to learn that the “guilt/pity” card doesn’t work on his fans anymore... 

Plenty of people have had lives worse than mine and his and don’t make racist crude jokes."
1345,2020-06-29 14:55:57,hhnooh,"I agree that he needs help. I stated that in my comment. And he is still a person. That’s not an argument, it’s a true statement and can applied to any human being. We’re on the same team here."

*disclaimer, sexualizing a child is NOT a joke, and my referral to it being a “joke” is that people keep saying it was “just a joke”.

Edit: how is this *possibly* a controversial comment"
1350,2020-06-29 03:29:01,hhna13,"Is not funny that everybody is now cancelling him and feeling so offended for some shitty sensitive “joke” he did around 10 fucking years ago.

I mean, no one gives a shit, except the people who have no problems in the real life and needs to feel identified with some  arrogant moralist with 1 million of likes in Twitter talking about how we need to cancel him"
1351,2020-07-02 01:08:03,hhna13,That’s my favourite Smiths song.

1353,2020-06-28 22:26:40,hhna13,"Low effort, shitpost?"
1354,2020-06-29 03:38:04,hhna13,"It’s not about being “offended”... it’s that he sexualized children. Why is this so hard for you to grasp??? Holy shit????

That is also *literally not true*. Many MANY people who are upset are upset because men JUST LIKE SHANE have hurt them, and there are pedo apologists like you who are downplaying his predatory behaviour as jokes. 

You didn’t answer my question. Would you be able to make the same “jokes”?

Edit: and by “arrogant moralist” do you mean Jaden being upset on twitter because a grown man pretended to masturbate to his 11 year old sister? Are you seriously unable to see why he’s upset???"
1355,2020-07-02 02:04:05,hhna13,Yeah it’s a great song!!!
1356,2020-06-29 02:38:07,hhna13,"I feel like they can be mad at more than one thing.. also, did you *see* what Shane Dawson did?"
1357,2020-06-28 22:46:19,hhna13,"What are you talking about?? I memed a news story. Are you literally just pissed that I posted something involving a black family??

Edit: nice edit buddy! For context guys, he said this doesn’t belong here because this isn’t a BLM subreddit! Also? Not low effort at all, I stand by this joke, it is perfect and funny, and you’re a rude dork ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
1358,2020-06-29 03:53:35,hhna13,"Is ok to be offended about jokes of pedophilia, what is wrong is to attack him because millions of people do. And he said sorry few times. That was back in 2012 if I’m not wrong

What’s the point of cancelling him now??"

1360,2020-06-29 02:13:25,hhna13,The world would be a better place if more people used the word dork.
1361,2020-06-29 00:21:22,hhna13,"I wouldn't say perfect, but it was funny. Then again, the whole comedy is subjective routine and all that"
1362,2020-06-29 03:57:50,hhna13,"You have not answered my question. Why are you avoiding my question?

Edit: oop lmao I need to go to bed, I thought you were that other guy. Apologies for being so intense about the question! However, no apologies whatsoever about anything else. Shane is a racist predator, and “cancel culture” is just a scary term people like to use when they don’t want someone to be held accountable. He should not have a platform, and if “cancelling” is the route that gets a racist predator deplatformed, so be it. He deserves nothing, and we are under no obligation to protect monsters. People like to say “it was years ago”... yeah, and? It was wrong 10 years ago too. Just cause he got better at hiding his abhorrent behaviours we’re supposed to just be fine with him? Nah. No fucking way."
1363,2020-06-29 02:45:49,hhna13,"The issue wasn’t that he was “making fun” of willow *or* disney... it’s that he was pretending to masturbate to a picture of a child. Bad enough on it’s own, worse when you add the context of all his other predatory behaviour.

What are you even trying to argue? Who knows if they’re mad at Disney? That’s a weird guess.

Idk man, if you can’t see the issue with pretending to masturbate to a child..."
1364,2020-06-29 02:16:43,hhna13,"I wholeheartedly agree, dork ❤️"
1365,2020-06-29 00:22:48,hhna13,"I respect your view. I still stand by saying it’s perfect, due to the absence of even one flaw, but I respect you."
1366,2020-06-29 12:55:11,hhna13,"Sorry, that was my opinion too.

I mean, even if you find offensive the ''jokes'' he did, there still no reason to put him in a situation of shame and social pressure WHEN he already made a a video apologizing himself

You have the right to feel offended for what he did, but when millions get offended too, then you can't ''cancel'' him anymore when he is already ''canceled''.

I feel offended for what other people do and say, and I don't attack them, because I have not the power to do so."
1367,2020-06-29 02:54:08,hhna13,[deleted]
1368,2020-06-29 13:25:29,hhna13,"It’s not that they were offensive. It’s. That. He. Sexualized. Kids. That does *damage* to the children. Imagine how 11 year old willow would have felt watching that video?You can apologize till you’re blue in the face, but you *can’t unhurt people*. Also, not sure if you watched the apology, but it was *not an apology*. It was an attempt to distance himself from what he did, & to blame his bad childhood. He took no accountability, beyond hyperbolic statements he thought we wanted to hear. He stole the structure of the video from Jenna, and much of the wording from drama channels. It was a crap apology, the same energy as the apology one gets from an abusive boyfriend who really wants you to let him do whatever he wants again.

I’m really disturbed by the fact that so many people think the issue with the “jokes” about children is that they’re “offensive”. *it’s that they did damage to ACTUAL CHILDREN.* 

If you made those jokes at work, you’d be fired, and asked to leave the premises immediately (and rightfully so.) On YouTube, it’s pretty hard to do that, so, a bunch of people have to collectively choose not to watch him in order to have him “fired”. If denouncing cancel culture is more important to you than protecting his young viewers from his incessant normalization of racism, antisemitism, and pedophilia, I’d like to invite you to question that."
1369,2020-06-29 03:10:04,hhna13,"Man, everyone else who saw that video was sick to their stomach... might be worth looking into why it didn’t have the same effect on you. Would *you* be able to do what Shane did? Shane *does* “actually” sexualize kids, also. The willow thing FOR STARTERS, the sharing dick shaped cookies with a 10 year old thing, calling a 6 year old sexy, saying a baby being raped to death is “amazing”, simulating sexual activities in front of a 12 year old, going on video chat with 11-13 year olds and having them twerk for him, defending pedophilia, talking about masturbating in kids’ rooms, making a whole fucking series about graphically sexually abusing a young girl (portrayed by a puppet) who is also raped by her parents, NEED I GO ON? And you’re sitting here defending him? Shit dude? I didn’t even go into the racism. You really wanna start with the “well what about THIS” bullshit? We’re not *talking* about Disney right now, so stop deflecting."
1370,2020-06-28 21:24:29,hhmobo,Someone won’t be getting any visits in the nursing home.
1371,2020-06-28 23:20:55,hhmobo,Wtf the husband does not have a say over anything homie that’s YOUR body. Also the fact she was so smug telling you that is really fucking creepy
1372,2020-06-28 21:24:42,hhmobo,She sounds like a delight.
1373,2020-06-29 01:40:33,hhmobo,"So she's telling you that you're the property of your future husband. Sorry, but that's a fucked up way to raise a kid. You're your own person. You're gonna be equal with your future husband. And finally, your body, your choice."
1374,2020-06-28 22:14:02,hhmobo,It’ll be great when she is proved wrong! What a piece of work.
1375,2020-06-28 23:28:27,hhmobo,"Next time remind her how she has to be really nice to you or you might just dump her in the crappiest nursing home you can find.

Seriously though, WTF???"
1376,2020-06-29 00:01:06,hhmobo,Take the dogs!
1377,2020-06-29 00:47:21,hhmobo,"I'll start off by saying I'm really sorry that you have to deal with this.

People like this are a certain kind of stupid.

Loving parents don't harp on things that their child will never be, or will never try to push them into a decision that will make them change their mind. They give them autonomy and room to grow.

I can't quite fathom how someone can just say these things insinuating that the love they have for their child isn't unconditional. Even when they just so happen to be lucky enough to be born into the right standards.

You deserve better than this and I hope that one day you can have a relationship with someone as a 'parental figure' that really actually cares about you. Because we all deserve to have someone care about us like that. You don't deserve to be verbally harangued because you dare to disagree."
1378,2020-06-28 23:07:55,hhmobo,Change your number and block her on everything imaginable. If she’s going to treat you with such vitriol and disrespect there’s no reason to waste any time on this person.
1379,2020-06-29 02:00:40,hhmobo,Get married if you want to but single life is great too.
1380,2020-06-29 06:59:09,hhmobo,"Our mothers have the same ""L"" energy"
1381,2020-06-29 09:58:48,hhmobo,"It's so sad when folks are terribly homophobic blatantly sexist as in this case, and they excuse themselves as ""old school"", to disguise their bigotry as something not so bad."
1382,2020-06-29 00:24:21,hhmobo,"I don't get why people wanna marry (and I'm not specifically referring to gay people - I'm probably aromantic, I just don't get it in general), but if you're made happier by engaging in the legal process of marriage, then have fun, whatever you decide to do about it!"
1383,2020-06-29 07:25:57,hhmobo,"As a child free man, we exist. Also, no, men don't have 'the say' in having kids, shit housewives magazines might have your mother believing otherwise"
1384,2020-06-29 09:03:27,hhmobo,What a bitch
1385,2020-06-29 12:20:47,hhmobo,What a toxic relationship.
1386,2020-06-28 22:32:19,hhmobo,My mother gaslit too. She said you were being harsh? Why do you still have contact with her if youre over 18?
1387,2020-06-29 02:26:03,hhmobo,About the pets... after moving out I kept visiting my mom to see my cat... It didnt last. She didnt abuse him but it wasnt sustainable. Perhaps you can rehome them?
1388,2020-06-29 03:23:01,hhmobo,Is her name Karen by chance ?
1389,2020-06-29 10:31:19,hhmobo,"Take your dogs with you or give them immediately to a reliable (and against-suppression or animal-right activist) friend, please. Good luck for your free life!"
1390,2020-06-29 10:49:58,hhmobo,"Can you do something about the dogs? Please, call animal control, that's horrifying!"
1391,2020-06-28 22:56:40,hhmobo,Someone won't get money for nursing gome
1392,2020-06-28 23:12:52,hhmobo,Sure won't. She thinks I will tho and shes got it in her mind that when she passes I'll be the main one crying at her funeral. 😂
1393,2020-06-28 23:22:23,hhmobo,She's a pickme and loves to project. Chances are she was talking about herself considering all of her kids (including me) were accidents but she's pro-life a.k.a anti-choice 😍
1394,2020-06-28 23:11:59,hhmobo,Truly 😍
1395,2020-06-29 03:26:55,hhmobo,"I know, right?!! The mom is stuck in 1954 or something. 🤮"
1396,2020-06-29 00:05:10,hhmobo,I wish. Don't have the financial stability. 😣
1397,2020-06-28 23:10:54,hhmobo,Im 17. My bad. I shouldve included that but i will be sure to ditch her once im able.
1398,2020-06-29 01:56:23,hhmobo,"Among all my fellow queer (and poly) peers: tax breaks. That is literally the ONLY. reason why. If not for that most of us would be content with a domestic partnership, or even a handfasting ceremony."
1399,2020-06-28 23:11:33,hhmobo,Im not. Im 17.
1400,2020-06-29 11:56:36,hhmobo,"A name doesn’t change the situation at all. Do you have any right to think lowly of  someone just because they are named the certain way? No, you don’t. And don’t you dare think that all people named that name are the same because they are don’t. Only strong willed, powerful, and great persons are allowed to be named  “Karen”, and that bitch is nothing like that. And I bet that this bitch has YOUR name, because you sound just as disgusting as her."
1401,2020-06-28 23:26:51,hhmobo,"Girl, I'll be the one to PUT her in a nursing home. The cheapest one money can buy. 😏"
1402,2020-06-28 23:21:47,hhmobo,Pissing on her grave more like. ;)
1403,2020-06-29 02:24:03,hhmobo,Of course she is.
1404,2020-06-29 00:05:39,hhmobo,Ah. I fully understand. Rehome them the night you move then lol 😂
1405,2020-06-29 02:54:47,hhmobo,Good to hear. A lot of adults in your situation just say “lol can’t do anything about it!” I hope you can find a safe place to go when you need even if it’s just another mental space to be.
1406,2020-06-29 03:46:10,hhmobo,"I get what you mean, but it seems to me like OP specifically wants to have a legal contract with a person she's in a romantic relationship with, so I don't think what you said is applicable here. I do understand people who marry for the tax breaks (even if personally I'd rather not engage even if it means forgoing tax breaks) do that - and I don't understand people who actually want to specifically be legally married for the sake of it. I still respect them, and wish OP the best in finding what she's looking for!"
1407,2020-06-28 23:13:53,hhmobo,Well youre almost 18 hopefully soon. I havent been happier since I've distanced myself from family. They were toxic in so many ways besides being misogynistic. I know some people still stay in contact with family members like this. Not telling you what to do but you may feel relief if you move out after 18 and get some space at least. My mother was super controlling and had to know where I was and what I was doing 24/7. Basically had my brothers spy on me.
1408,2020-06-29 12:29:46,hhmobo,LMFAOOOO is *your* name Karen ? Because that was such a Karenesque response 😂😂😂
1409,2020-06-28 23:30:31,hhmobo,I think that would be the waste of money. She is an adult even when she is old and should be able to care for herself
1410,2020-06-29 12:58:19,hhmobo,Save money on the nursing hone and just put her in a box in the corner of the pantry. That costs nothing!
1411,2020-06-29 09:11:11,hhmobo,"I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. 

The cheap nursing homes are where you will find bed sores, malnourishment, and even emotional, mental and physical abuse. 

There was an article I read a long while back about CNAs that posted a video of two residents actually fighting and they were *encouraging* them to fight! 

I've seen residents that come from places like that, I briefly worked in a place like that, and it is so so so so sad and heart-wrenching to watch. 

I understand the sentiment but it's a different story when you see it up close. 

It's heart-breaking when these little old women start crying and apologizing profusely for their incontinence because they were punished for it in their last home. (Be it family or facility) 

They're often under weight, scared to speak, scared to eat, and are afraid to ask *for anything* because they don't want to be a burden or make anyone upset at them. 

It takes *a lot* of TLC to get them where they need to be - to make bath time a positive experience, to make toileting a natural part of their day, and to make them comfortable enough to ask for food and water. 

Bringing them to activities can be a struggle because they're so scared and over stimulated but I do it anyway - I try to sit with them and hold their hand so they don't have to be scared and I introduce them to everyone. 

I make a point to ask what they want to wear, what they want to watch on television - giving them agency where I can: it builds their self esteem and helps them realize they are safe now.

Elder abuse is a thing and its a *horrible, horrible, horrible* thing. 

I'd *rather* see folks pay a little extra to put their loved ones in a decent place and shut down those awful places for good."
1412,2020-06-29 05:32:23,hhmobo,You are why I will never have children. 🙃
1413,2020-06-29 00:18:45,hhmobo,"I don't want to give them up. They're my babies and I care about them. Its not a frequent abuse thing. Its just when they make little doggy mistakes she threatens them. The plan is earn money while in college so I can come back and get them my sophmore or junior year. But i'll be sure to visit them from time to time and check up on them daily. Besides, they're one person dogs. They'd die of depression if anyone else got them."
1414,2020-06-29 04:04:54,hhmobo,"I was specifically responding to your own statement of ""I don't get why people wanna marry"" comment, rather than OP's preference of a legal contract :)."
1415,2020-06-28 23:17:18,hhmobo,">My mother was super controlling and had to know where I was and what I was doing 24/7.

Are we living the same life? She keeps on talking about how shes gonna follow me wherever I go and keeps on trying to convince me to go to an in-state college. She hates the idea of me being independent."
1416,2020-06-28 23:38:40,hhmobo,The point isn't whether she can take care of herself or not. The point is she despises the thought of it.
1417,2020-07-18 02:43:43,hhmobo,"This is a wonderful post, full of good information - thank you."
1418,2020-06-29 13:23:56,hhmobo,I see this girl is already turning into her narcistic mother
1419,2020-06-29 00:23:26,hhmobo,"Temporarily rehome them with a trusted friend, if possible. Keep a paper trail so that if anything happens you have protection and rights to sue (just to be safe)."
1420,2020-06-29 00:19:54,hhmobo,Oh! Sorry! I was semi joking. I hope your plan works out!! Good luck with moving out and college! I hope you have the best experience!
1421,2020-06-28 23:26:51,hhmobo,">She hates the idea of me being independent.

@ my father who keeps giving me traveling brochures for these ""group camps"" that go on backpacking trips for 25+ days instead of supporting me in getting my degree."
1422,2020-06-28 23:26:02,hhmobo,"I wish i had gone to an out of state college! I didnt have the money for it. I started working at age 15 and saved up money for college. I paid the first 2 years out of pocket. Then had to take out loans to finish. She said she wouldn't help me with college at all because she found out I was on birth control pills. I wasn't allowed to go on them because she is super religious but I have heavy periods and would miss school and work due to them but to her it meant I was having sex. There's no way I was going to have sex while I was living with her because I knew if I got pregnant I'd be stuck raising a kid under her. I never asked her to help me with college, I just needed family financial info that stated they had poor credit so I could get loans in my name and not hers. She refused to help me for 6 months and I almost had to drop out. Eventually found loans to continue college. She basically told me I was at college to find a husband and have kids. She's also racist. I brought my now husband home one time to meet her, he looks Mexican because he can grow thick facial hair. His dad is Welsch and his mom is Thai. She treated him like shit until she realized he was Asian and not so poor. Pissed me off. Anyways I'm married without kids. I changed my phone number a few times to get away from them and don't give out my info to anyone that has contact with them. Ive told other relatives I would like my info to not be passed onto them. Some havent listened and ive stopped talking to them as well. My parents like to do this thing where when they're mad at you they just show up unannounced on your fucking doorstep. Absolutely hate it. They do it on purpose and act like something is wrong with you, you offended them straight up gaslighting. I mean we live 2 hours apart and you can't call to say you're coming? Feels like a scare tactic. Im at the point now where we have a house and if I see them here I will tell them to leave my fucking property before I call the cops."
1423,2020-06-28 23:46:35,hhmobo,So you will put her there agaist her will? Is that even legal?
1424,2020-06-29 03:02:41,hhmobo,Wait a second....your parents show up UNANNOUNCED?!!! OH. HELL. NO!!!! 😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠
1425,2020-06-28 23:53:35,hhmobo,"Yes, indeed it is."
1426,2020-06-29 03:17:43,hhmobo,"Yes theyve always done this. Even at school when they deemed me in trouble for something. My mom would come stomping down the high school hallways. Any time I see a family member and not expecting it I get this shot of like fear that zings through my stomach. I havent talked to them since I was 23, im 30 now, and one time I went shopping at the mall i used to near their house. I saw my mom at the mall and got that panicked/fear feeling."
1427,2020-06-28 23:59:13,hhmobo,Wow I'm stunned. What country allows to put their full rights citizens agaist their will in practical prisons? Except  they are mentally ill or criminals
1428,2020-06-29 02:09:55,hhmobo,Really people there's something like human rights. Maybe you heard about it?
1429,2020-06-29 07:13:02,hhmobo,"When a person becomes unable to take care of themselves, and their family is unable to do it either, they go into a nursing home, to where they can 24/7 access to a nurse."
1430,2020-06-29 09:00:28,hhmobo,"Excellent question! It does take a lot for it to happen but a person *can* have a relative placed in a nursing home for numerous reasons. 

- Alzheimers/Dementia

Both of these illnesses essentially cause the person to live in an altered state of reality. It affects their vision and hearing. For example, lighting on a tile floor can look ""flooded"" to them. A bathtub full of water can appear empty. They might start wandering around the neighborhood or forget to turn off a stove. Or worse, fall and hurt themselves. 

- Old Age

When they become too old to care for themselves. Usually this occurs if they've fallen at home and injured themselves - some go into facilities for rehab with the intent of returning home and sometimes they come back with another injury and become a permanent resident."
1431,2020-06-29 02:23:32,hhmobo,"Sounds like this mother does not accept gay rights, which are human rights."
1432,2020-06-29 09:10:56,hhmobo,"""The point isn't whether she can take care of herself or not. The point is she despises the thought of it"" Girl clearly wants to do this out of spite of her mother. So we aren't talking about dementia or that old age to not care for yourself"
1433,2020-06-29 02:31:29,hhmobo,It doesn't mean that human rights don't apply to her. Human rights apply also for terrorists and war criminals. Beeing shitty person doesn't refuse you basic human rights and law
1434,2020-06-29 14:29:34,hhmobo,"Well until she can care for herself she's obviously not going to a nursing home. But it's also obvious that her daughter will never nurse for her, so if she needs care/supervision/shopping/etc it's only happening for her in a nursing home.

Old people who live long enough definitely reach a stage where they are not able to take care of their house and food anymore, at 80+ usually.

Of course, even then she might be able to decline a nursing home, not sure about the laws. But then she chooses to starve because she cannot shop or cook and to live in an unmaintained home because she cannot clean anymore (and I doubt most people can afford help from their own pocket at that age)."
1435,2020-06-29 19:14:03,hhmobo,"No, they can't but there are programs in place to help with that as well. 

I've met *a lot* of residents whose families just drop them off and ride off into the sunset never to be seen or heard from again. 

This bothered a lot of CNAs until I said to them, 

""You don't know what this person was like until they became helpless - they could have been the worst person ever and are probably lucky they were even dropped off here."" 

I try to keep that in mind when they complain about families not wanting to come around - I do my best not to judge but when I think of the cheapest nursing home...

1439,2020-06-29 02:34:00,hhkhyl,Should Phil D and Dawson end their channels?
1440,2020-06-29 03:06:53,hhkhyl,Interesting that this should surface just a day or so after Shane leaves a 20-minute long video on his channel in which he unequivocally apologizes for essentially his entire past.
1441,2020-06-29 02:35:06,hhkhyl,I mean Phil has never sexualized a child.
1442,2020-06-29 12:29:01,hhkhyl,"I respectfully disagree. His first response was to call the beauty community toxic when he hang out with the single most toxic group of people and saying he ""was leaving"" when he never ever was a part of it. (I can point you to a video explaining). After pretty much everyone called him out on that and started pointing out how toxic his actions were and how many times he was openly ""problematic"" to say the least, that's when he got the ""apology"" out. But the can of worms was out so we are learning more and more. His video is a PR attempt to save it."
1443,2020-06-29 07:23:27,hhkhyl,An apology isnt enough though especially after Jenna Marbles essentially got run off the internet for something he also did
1444,2020-06-29 02:44:33,hhkhyl,"Maybe not, but he removed his older videos, including a controversial racial video"
1445,2020-06-29 12:22:19,hhkhyl,"Nu-uh, don't compare Jenna 's real apology and taking responsibility for her actions and learning from her mistakes to Shane's pattern of behaviour for many years."
1446,2020-06-29 12:20:32,hhkhyl,That means he learned from his mistakes and has evolved as a person. Meanwhile we can't say the same for Sharissa or Joffrey Slot
1447,2020-06-30 10:27:28,hhkhyl,"I think he's definitely covering his arse, I wonder if the cancel culture will come for him?"

1455,2020-06-28 20:33:39,hhk8ey,"As much as a rolemodel and inspiration blaire has been for me for many years shes starting to slip 

Like she said that she was given evidence that james charles did infact sexually assault someone but doesen’t want to go out with it because reasons?

A while back she got angry at jessica yanivs agent/manager/whatever for not releasing the apparent evidence he had on jessica sexually assaulting people or something

What the hell?? Is it just going to slide?"
1456,2020-06-28 21:47:14,hhk8ey,So we can't make certain jokes about things? But it was funny in the past but now it's super offensive?
1457,2020-06-28 19:39:13,hhk8ey,"Same. I know she’s been in a really bad spot lately and I’m sad she got dragged into all of this. I’m sure it’s taken a toll on her mental health, especially since she’s already been having a hard time after being doxxed and being stuck in quarantine. Hopefully things start to look up soon."
1458,2020-06-28 20:40:06,hhk8ey,"The problem is that she wasn’t given the evidence. It was played for her while she was on a Facetime call that she wasn’t recording.

If she actually had the evidence, I have no doubt she would’ve gone to the police/FBI with it. But since she doesn’t have a copy of it, all she could’ve done is reach out to the victim and expose J* for holding it over everyone’s head, which she did. At this point, it’s up to the victim to decide if they would like to stay anonymous or take the evidence to the police themselves. Blaire can’t report the crime on their behalf."
1459,2020-06-28 20:40:37,hhk8ey,Ah I see thanks
1460,2020-06-28 19:24:02,hhjyhw,"It's tough, I had a really close friend who was convicted as a paedophile and neither myself or my friendship group knew how to take that. We just did not suspect a thing. The first few days were spent in shock and disgust but also disbelief that this was the same person. The closest thing I can relate it to is when someone you care about dies suddenly but with a horrible bitter edge. We completely cut him off and out of our lives and a couple of us recieved therapy for the shock. I imagine this isnt too dissimilar to how blaire feels now x"
1461,2020-06-28 22:27:27,hhjyhw,Ok im proud of Blair
1462,2020-06-28 18:55:07,hhjyhw,"My concern, bc I love blaire white, is if there is no actual evidence of james being a predator which she just resurfaced the entire allegations and so forth, she is beyond fucked. I personally think JS wanted it to happen this way. And she fell right into it. She posted on her story victims of james and other youtubers are coming forward and confirming that he is in fact, a predator. All we can do is see what happens next."
1463,2020-06-28 23:01:58,hhjyhw,It's kinda funny because one of the things that made me start questioning Shane's morals was his collab with Blaire. However I'm starting to like her more because of this because despite her own (numerous) problems I think she doesn't mess around with rape and molestation. I appreciate her sticking to her morals here even if she has to turn on the person who made her blow up in the first place.
1464,2020-06-29 03:44:22,hhjyhw,Proud of Blaire for this.

1466,2020-06-28 22:09:27,hhjyhw,I’m so sorry to hear that. You truly never know what’s going on behind closed doors and I can’t imagine how sickening it must’ve been to find out that a person you trusted had been taking advantage of children (or even thinking about it). I hope your friend group is doing okay and I’m glad you were able to cut him out!
1467,2020-06-29 03:50:47,hhjyhw,Yeah this happened to me and my friends (he was basically my closest friend and emotional support). It's so hard to accept it. Especially thinking of old red flags. It's the worst.
1468,2020-06-28 19:03:48,hhjyhw,"It’s all such a mess. I feel so bad that she got trapped in the middle of all of this—and I feel even worse if the allegations are true and J* is going around sharing a victim’s voice memos as if it’s some tea that needs to be spilt.

I’m all for free speech, but there comes a point where YouTube needs to put their foot down and stop giving people like J* a platform to spew this crap on. Like Blaire said, this isn’t tea. These are serious allegations that shouldn’t be taken lightly or spread around to drama channels. Regardless of whether the voice memo is legit, this behavior is freaking disgusting."
1469,2020-06-29 08:38:59,hhjyhw,"blaire really isnt nearly as bad as people assume she is. at first i wasn't sure about her as well but i've found after watching a lot more of her content that while i may not agree with all her opinions she really does have a heart, she's not trying to be mean for the sake of it or something"
1470,2020-06-28 22:07:52,hhjyhw,"Racist? Lol where

But the reason she is specifically mentioning his sexualization of children is because her channel focuses on exposing people like Onision and Jessica Yaniv for their predatory behavior. The whole reason she is making this statement is because she knows she’d be a hypocrite if she defended him when her entire channel is focused on exposing people like this."
1471,2020-06-28 21:20:35,hhjyhw,Right she’s a whole entire wh te supremacist and proud tr mp supporter
1472,2020-06-28 22:09:46,hhjyhw,"I totally agree with Blaire’s insight on the situation. I don’t see how making a video about it will do her any good, though. I love Blaire’s content and I appreciate where she’s coming from, but it’s almost like a conflict of interest. Sh was friends with Shane, now she isn’t. She disavowed Shane and Jeffree. I don’t see why she has to echo everything that everyone is already saying when it’s just so crappy that this is where she feels she is now. Imagine being a public figure and being less popular than Shane and Jeffree. It’s obvious this hurts her and I don’t see why she should have to be thrown to the mercy of rabid 13 year old stans."
1473,2020-06-29 02:03:41,hhjyhw,"She openly hates Black lives matter. 

Some of y'all at least need to PRETEND to have consistency... imagine if Shane came out against BLM?? He would be slaughtered lmao.

I don't think she's a white supremacist, but it's clear she is on the wrong side of that whole debate. She doesn't understand the racism black people experience and doesn't even try. She is much worse than shane as far as racism goes."
1474,2020-06-29 04:42:26,hhjyhw,No lmao
1475,2020-06-28 23:03:56,hhjyhw,"Yh i think she had to say something atleast about shane and she denounced his action at the end of the jeffree video and on her instagram otherwise she would have lost credibility/integrity based on what content she does now. 

Shes said something and i think thats all we can ask for a video doesnt further anything."
1476,2020-06-29 02:42:36,hhjyhw,"BLM represents different things to different people. She explains why in her videos, and even if you don’t agree with her it does NOT automatically mean she is a racist or literally thinks the lives of black people don’t matter.

Also to my knowledge she hasn’t said negative things about BLM in awhile, not since it was recontextualized with the George Floyd murder."
1477,2020-06-29 04:48:53,hhjyhw,Yes..she is openly a supporter of DT lol. Her choice but worth noting
1478,2020-06-28 23:08:36,hhjyhw,I know she said she doesn’t want to be a hypocrite. I just want everyone to be okay and learn from this and live better lives
1479,2020-06-29 03:01:39,hhjyhw,^^^
1480,2020-06-29 03:45:48,hhjyhw,"I agree with you that it doesn't make her a terrible racist white supremacist, but the hypocrisy of people calling Shane a racist for things he said 10 years ago vs people ignoring things that Blaire is *still doing right now* is astonishing. 

She is openly right wing, disagrees with the protests, and is pro police. She has got better in recent years, but it's clear that her views are still fundamentally the same. ""BLM represents different things to different people"" is an utterly meaningless statement. What matters is what it means to BLACK PEOPLE which is what I am. I personally find her views more offensive than any of Shane's old videos, because her politics in 2020 are still actively harming people that look like me."
1481,2020-06-29 04:59:06,hhjyhw,"She voted for Trump, yes, but has also publicly criticised him several times. Also has said she has mixed feelings about him and he is not her ideal choice for President. She is by no means a MAGA lifer like other right-wing commentators.
And she is absolutely not a white supremacist. That is a wild accusation and equating voting for Trump with necessarily being a white supremacist is reductive and harmful.

I'm not saying Trump doesnt have white supremacist supporters. It is demonstrably true that he does, but Blaire isnt one of them."
1482,2020-06-28 23:10:42,hhjyhw,"Yh watching her be upset made me sad, i cant imagine shes feeling great and i think she should go on a vacation to the middle of nowhere again for a while and enjoy herself."
1483,2020-06-29 04:16:04,hhjyhw,"Yeah, I honestly think calling Shane a terrible racist for something he did so long ago is going too far. You can be stupid and do a racist or offensive thing without being a labeled racist for the rest of your life. So yes, agree with the hypocrisy here.


You can say my statement is meaningless but not everyone thinks the same as you and there’s no denying that. Not all black people have the same politics either. Some people who don’t support BLM ARE definitely racist, but that doesn’t mean everyone automatically is. 

BLM is a huge political movement at this point, so not everyone views it as a simple “I am against racism” statement - even if they probably should. (Again, has she said she’s anti-BLM lately? I only remember her mentioning it in videos from years ago)


From the cursory glance I did to her Twitter, she made comments about not approving of the violent riots, which is not really a controversial stance at this point.  Did she say she’s against protests? I’m willing to be corrected here.


And even though I’m not right wing, its not productive to say every person who votes republican is automatically racist either"

Some stalker probably. I'm so fed up. The policr don't do much about it. They use fake numbers to text things like this, to make it look like someone else (a real person) is saying these things. Isn't that insane.. Plz lmk which app allows this because i want to report them!!! :( because my sister's been a victim of this for like a week now. She's terrified. So plz let me know, thank you."

1618,2020-06-28 20:44:26,hhczzc,He also has said some incredibly inappropriate things to his 12 year old cousin. This [thread](https://mobile.twitter.com/misshemlock/status/1276465876607229952) has a couple examples of it. I understand making an edgy joke and I very rarely support canceling someone because everyone has said racist or offensive shit in the past. I just do not understand this pattern of behavior surrounding pedophilia. I really do think that he might be a pedophile because of how often he talks about it and the complete lack of boundaries he has children

1625,2020-06-28 20:51:01,hhczzc,His conspiracy videos are garbage. The one where he spliced up footage of a human trafficking survivor telling her story with a conspiracy about Chuck E. Cheese pizza being recycled was embarrassing

1648,2020-06-29 07:28:15,hhczzc,"I also thought he was an edgelord until I saw all the video clips on a large Twitter thread by @misshemlock. It shows literal child abuse and it’s sickening. He asks for and receives a lap dance from a 12 year old cousin on video. He feeds dick shaped cookies to a little girl on video. There are accounts from girls who met him at meet and greets between 11 & 13 years old and he grabbed them, telling one “good girl” when she said she was uncomfortable but didn’t leave. He’s an outright pedophile and I hope there’s some way this guy faces actual criminal charges."

1655,2020-06-28 20:09:02,hhczzc,"Lol his production is good, if not a bit cliché. He adds pretty much nothing to the songs though."

It's crazy how cultish some of these communities are. And all the people that grew up with these gents.

I wonder if they're coming for Pewdiepie next. That should be interesting.

I'm telling you.. World war 3 is going to be a culture war with stans and cult members fighting each other..."

There’s a certain makeup company that has done sus things in the past and done collaborations with untrustworthy influencers. These corporate entities need to pull all those products and donate their profits. Overall, the beauty community, and I’m sure YouTube as a whole, needs a big purge"
1685,2020-06-29 17:02:25,hh7pg5,"The beauty community is VERY cultish! Fanbases will go to war for their favorite influencers.

I also find it interesting that what started off as beauty YouTube drama spilled into the real world with actual celebrities when the Smiths got involved. Idk much about Pewdipie, but I feel like many YouTubers won’t suffer consequences unless actual celebrities are involved, ya know?"

1703,2020-06-28 02:21:56,hh6cwi,The twitter thread has people I wouldn’t have thought caring now commenting that he should lose his channel. There’s also an article as well in the megathread.

it’ll be interesting to see how this plays out, morgan unfollowed jefree on instagram so i guess the dynamic is getting tested"
1711,2020-06-28 02:34:41,hh6cwi,"yea honestly. as someone that was a fan of his when i was younger (middle school) i found the content funny and stupid, now as a 21 year old i’m realizing he should have been finished a long time ago. 

he never showed growth based on who he’s become in the beauty world and who he associates himself with. everything has just been bullshit excuses"
1712,2020-06-28 02:24:13,hh6cwi,"Honestly though. It baffled my mind that he said that. Who is he to decide who deserve a slice of “humble pie?”

Plus who isn’t self-absorbed and in their own messes at 19?? Every 19 year-old has tons of growing to do, no exceptions. It’s so immature  and gross that James’ near career downfall was waved off by Shane as “well, J* was just excited to see a competitor fail—that’s all.”"

1715,2020-06-28 03:07:55,hh6cwi,"Someone said the picture is before she released the song, it's for a TV show, if that's the case it makes her younger. Around 9-10"

Dawson instead claimed he would “never talk about a child in any way that is inappropriate.” In the video, Dawson continued, “That is disgusting, that is gross, it is not something I would ever do. It is something I did for shock value or because I thought it was funny  

Love how he contradicts himself here. Says he would never do that, but then says he did, but for shock value & that it's funny.  What a creep."

I don’t watch youtubers out of habit, especially not the beauty guru/toxicity whores, but every now and then Facebook algorithms would throw a strong left turn and I’d find myself compelled to watch him the way one ends up watching a car crash. 

It makes me uncomfortable, whatever it is."

1745,2020-06-28 20:15:22,hh5z3u,People are so soft these days. Why be upset now? 10 years later?
1746,2020-06-28 12:47:51,hh5z3u,"Well, what kind of narcissistic psycho family lets their 11-year-old daughter become a celebrity and pose for poster sessions? As far as I’m concerned, that’s the real child abuse. What do you expect when you put your innocent virgin child on a platform for the world to look at? 

Getting a lot of negative feedback from being misunderstood. My point is that creeps exist in this world, and it’s naive and foolish to think that creeps are not going to do what creeps do. That’s why they’re creeps. 

Therefore, if you’re going to allow your 11-year-old child to be in the public spotlight, EXPECT the creeps to be creeps. I’m not blaming the victim, I’m simply saying “welcome to the sick world we live in, and if you want to protect your children from it, DONT put them in the public spotlight!” 

And that goes for all social media! Don’t post pictures of your naked babies or 4-year old children in two piece bathing suits from your beach vacation to your social media accounts. Why? Because there are CREEPS out there!!"
1747,2020-06-28 13:08:12,hh5z3u,"Probably - I used to like him and then I started seeing the bullshit, such a disappointment. I was seeing the cringe around the time the makeup colander happened and nearly bought some of the merch and I’m so glad I didn’t."

1751,2020-06-28 11:10:42,hh5z3u,TLDR: Shane Dawson is a old YouTube who got famous for doing videos in black face making fun of what he thought a black girl acted like.
1752,2020-06-28 14:50:30,hh5z3u,"I don’t know who he is, but it’s safe to say most of us are familiar with  that Smith Family."

It sounds more scandalous than it really was and you can restrict your family however you want but, many people have family friends or cousins that they’re very close to in a platonic way. You don’t know the relationship beyond that 1 picture and don’t know who else was there or if anyone was monitoring the situation.

Shane has a sketchy past, you gotta admit that. Even factoring in Will and Jada’s alternative parenting approaches, Shane making sexually charged comments about Willow who was 11 at the time is not excused."
1769,2020-06-28 15:54:25,hh5z3u,"Jada and Will are far from model people or parents. I never know why they are referred to as #goals, but same with the Kardashians, money affords you a status with some people, regardless of how crappy they are."
1770,2020-06-28 12:05:17,hh5z3u,It’s crazy. To think that three people in the entertainment industry would be news worthy in a sub about the entertainment industry.
1771,2020-06-28 12:51:48,hh5z3u,"While I agree that putting children into some manufactured spotlight is wrong, I hate the “what did you expect” mentality. We should always expect people to be better than that."
1772,2020-06-28 12:53:52,hh5z3u,"Okay, but that doesn’t excuse sexualizing a minor at all. Victim blaming isn’t the solution to this problem."
1773,2020-06-28 12:55:48,hh5z3u,"Buddy, she's the kid in this scenario."

1775,2020-06-28 13:50:19,hh5z3u,I’m so glad I managed to sell his book once I realised how shitty he was before he got cancelled
1776,2020-06-28 17:14:15,hh5z3u,I mean! Everyday I’m hearing about another bland random unseasoned personality getting media attention.  The bar for ‘fame’ has been lowered to the damn ground.
1777,2020-06-28 13:13:21,hh5z3u,The past scandal before this one was where he admitted on a radio interview that he used to hump his cat...............some people claimed it was fake. He said it was “shock value jokes” like he did with this scandal. He also claimed it was a joke taken out of context. But yea I think someone even petitioned to take his pets away from him (don’t know about the last bit so don’t quote me on that)

1779,2020-06-28 07:06:29,hh5z3u,...he’s made *multiple* comments on sexualizing minors and pedophilia jokes. He even had to make an “apology” video 2 years ago on the topic.
1780,2020-06-28 16:04:59,hh5z3u,She put out a video bringing up several videos that have been brought back up on Twitter that have been privated for a while. Then she talked about several videos that make her uncomfortable now because they can be offensive and how she has privated them too. She obviously is super embarrassed and upset about what she’s done in the past and is still considering if she will ever make content for that channel(her main channel) again.
1781,2020-07-02 15:02:39,hh5z3u,I think you're referring to her blackface video which was removed and an apology video posted
1782,2020-07-13 10:01:50,hh5z3u,"You know, I honestly couldn't care less."
1783,2020-06-28 19:39:30,hh5z3u,"I had no clue who he is. Had to Google him. Grateful I’ve made it this long without ever hearing about him.

Edit: oh, excuse me to all the Shane Whatshisname fans out there who I offended by not knowing who he is. Fuck you ever so much."
1784,2020-06-28 12:03:25,hh5z3u,Loll I was going based off the tweets dick comment by me
1785,2020-06-28 13:20:15,hh5z3u,But cringy twitter quotes define everyone when magically uncovered years later in a social media shitstorm scandal?
1786,2020-06-28 12:11:32,hh5z3u,"Pretty sure that’s exactly what they do though lol   How is this downvoted? It is literally why people post quotes , because they find connections and inspiration within them , a kinship."

I didn’t realize it would be controversial I m not sure how to understand what s going on but hey it s Reddit
1789,2020-06-28 12:35:01,hh5z3u,"I guess from the downvote I m getting people tend to agree with you and find it normal.

I read and it what s going in has nothing to do with entertainment or even the industry at large it s about some YouTube dude masturbating to the picture of an 11 years old...."
1790,2020-06-28 13:01:51,hh5z3u,"I’m not blaming the victim, I’m saying that the family has no room to complain about their daughter’s/sister’s image being mocked in this way. Fame and fortune are the two most destructive things you can give a child. And to think that people in the world aren’t scum enough to do stuff like this, it’s absolutely foolish. If they’re truly offended, maybe they should be reconsidering their privilege and asking themselves “is it worth it?”"
1791,2020-06-28 15:11:42,hh5z3u,"? I’m fucked up for saying that parents giving Fame and Fortune to their 11-year-old child is child abuse in itself? I don’t even post pictures of my kids on social media because I don’t want fuckin creeps creeping on them like this Dawson guy did to exactly prove my point. Who is at fault in this situation? The creep for being a creep because he *is* a creep, or the parents who put their child up on a public pedestal for the world to gaze at?"
1792,2020-06-28 18:55:31,hh5z3u,Well considering he used to be one of the top YouTube stars back in the day

I am not a Shane Dawson fan. For clarity... when you say - unseasoned - are you using it as a synonym for bland? Usually unseasoned means something else when describing professions or people."

Edit: I hope she’s out there enjoying elder scrolls online 🙏"
1797,2020-06-28 17:07:17,hh5z3u,I only know her name for her awful videos in the past. I’m genuinely surprised she was able to grow her platform.
1798,2020-06-28 19:44:58,hh5z3u,"Mm, his conspiracy videos were fun. But I never watched his older stuff (where he did all this disgusting jokes & stuff)

I find it hypocritical that the fans who want the “old Shane” and who “used to be fans” and “grew up with him” are now cancelling him because the shit they liked back then is what’s getting him in hot water now. Like... I don’t get it. He hasn’t done shocking jokes or blackface in years, so the “old Shane” they liked has to be the racist Shane... So they enjoyed it then and he blew up big on the platform because of those nasty videos/podcast but now that he’s moved on to makeup & documentaries,NOW they have a problem?

I get that the catalyst is his possible involvement with the James Charles fiasco (last year a few YTers said that 19yr old James Charles was a predator to straight men. Turned out they had no evidence and James even had evidence to REFUTE their claims) and being friends with Jeffree Star and Trisha Paytas. That’s why he’s being cancelled now except they’re bringing up stuff he did 7 years ago... things his “old fans” supported back then...."

You’re blaming the family for the results of the actions taken by the victimizer."
1806,2020-06-28 15:08:03,hh5z3u,"So child actors that are abused by producers should blame their parents OVER AND ABOVE the abusers?

1816,2020-06-28 13:40:11,hh5z3u,Sorry but went I read stories about child abusers if the guy concerned is working as a pool cleaner I doubt that story would end on r/ swimmingpools. It s only here cause they are some kind of celebrities it does not reflect the industry how do you not understand that ?
1817,2020-06-28 13:00:23,hh5z3u,I feel I ve been dragged away from my original comment discussing weather these guys work in the entertainment industry when I was pointing out that what is going on in there has nothing to do with the entertainment industry
1818,2020-06-28 16:20:08,hh5z3u,"Okay, I can respect that. Well said. I guess I’m just pointing out that it’s a sick world, and I as a parent, understanding that it can be a sick world, choose to take precautions and would never allow my 11-year-old to be in the same public spotlight as myself in the first place. As a parent, it’s hard not to blame yourself when stuff like this happens and child celebrities have to go through this shit on a daily basis."
1819,2020-06-28 15:19:15,hh5z3u,"“What do you expect?” Meaning that the world is a sick place. You’re foolish to expect the creeps to *not* be creepy. They’re creeps. That’s what creeps do. If you’re going to put your child on a pedestal, EXPECT the creepy to do what the creepy do. Otherwise, don’t put your child in the public spotlight."
1820,2020-06-28 21:45:47,hh5z3u,"I was asking for clarity, so that I understood what you meant by your comment. I went and looked into the guy and it appeared that he’s been around for awhile on YouTube - so I was confused by your comment. Seems reasonable to ask what you meant. My bad I guess"

1827,2020-06-28 14:01:03,hh5z3u,That would be something I would happily discuss. I don’t think an industry revolves largely about the personal life of its active members. Most the posts on this subs are about new movies or new filming techniques and such. I m guessing from your name your work or are involved with graphics and visual effects and to me your contribution to the industry would be greater than the personal life of celebrities
1828,2020-06-28 13:24:54,hh5z3u,But when and where did I argue with that? A lot of platforms or even social medias belong to that industry of course I agree with you I m just pointing this article is about child abuse it s a lot bigger than just these guys’ jobs and therefore has little to do with this sub
1829,2020-06-28 22:42:51,hh5z3u,"O.... K... You realize just saying absurd things isn't humor. Creating a joke is a building of tension and then popping that tension with the punchline. Saying absurdities isn't humor, it's just saying absurd things that may get a laugh but not like a joke would.

Behold a master! Like Dave Chappelle does a great bit how he comes up with a punch line and then creates a joke around it. ""[Kick her in the pussy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHkHw-NQ5Wk)"" is an absurd statement but only funny within the context of what he is discussing. He just doesn't get on stage and say ""Kick her in the pussy"" and expect a laugh. There is a setup and pay off, saying ""Humping my cat"" is just an absurd statement, not a joke. NO different than the stupid ""Scary Movies"" spoofy movies just spit firing shit like ""Lawl so random!""

Wish people would stop using ""jokes""as an adamantium shield against being unfunny edgelords."
1830,2020-06-28 22:46:41,hh5z3u,"I never said it was funny, or that it was a successful joke. Have you listened to the podcast? It was clear he was trying to be humorous, and he wasn’t successful.

I don’t claim to be an expert on joke structure but I can recognize when someone is trying to make a joke. He was clearly trying to be edgy, and I don’t believe for a second that he actually jerked off onto his cat. If you do then you’re a moron."
1831,2020-06-28 22:51:42,hh5z3u,">I never said it was funny, or that it was a successful joke

That much is clear. I asked you what made it a joke, you said it's absurdity. I responded that just saying absurdities isn't humor, it's not a joke. It's an absurd statement, like you and him admitted, meant to be edgey, not a joke."
1832,2020-06-28 22:55:21,hh5z3u,Okay so you’re going to be that pedantic? An absurd statement said for intended humorous effect doesn’t count as a joke? Fuck off.

1836,2020-06-28 02:05:41,hh5kfc,"Answer: 1.) In one of his podcasts he talks about humping his cat's belly.

2.) He has done numerous videos with blackface on portraying a black woman stereotype. Dark-toned foundation, black curly hair wigs, bright colored makeup, and a heavy ebonics accent. He has also done a latino woman stereotype where she had a lot of kids, always yelled at them and never cared for them, and did heavy makeup with a dark-toned foundation on.

3.) He filmed a video where he's standing next to a billboard/ad with Willow Smith on it when she was a little child, pretending to masturbate to it and turning around to look at the camera and ""get caught.""

4.) He's friends with Jeffree Star, whom he recently collaborated with for a makeup line. Star has a known racist past."

Shane Dawson has made a lot of “shock videos” on his time on the internet including talking about sexual topics to young girls (including willow smith), describing a rather violent daydream about harming someone That had criticized him, joking about coming on his cat, & blackface. He’s also friends with Jeffree Star (who is quite controversial) and other people deemed “problematic”. Two years ago he made a docuseries about Jeffree Star. This then led to a makeup collaboration last year with Jeffree Star and another series about making a eyeshadow palette/ merchandise/ lipstick/etc.  he recently posted a goodbye message on Twitter about leaving the beauty community and in the process called everyone dramatic and also said James Charles (a make up youtuber that was in drama last year) needed a slice of humble pie. This “goodbye” to a community he was never really apart of has led to his past actions being brought into the limelight.

1840,2020-06-28 03:30:10,hh5kfc,"Answer: Shane Dawson got famous for making dark shock humor sketch videos and parodies from 2008 to like 2015, on his ShaneDawsonTV channel (that were pushing the envelope at the time and definitely would not be something a Youtuber could make money on today) and then started only posting vlogs on his ""iphone channel"" called ""shane"", which is where a lot of normies who watch him today discovered him, not knowing he got famous for making actual content and just thinking he was some random gay person who makes vlogs about makeup and conspiracy theories.

The reason he did humor about black people a lot was because he grew up in a black neighborhood and had a lot of black friends.

Normies find out about his actual videos which were always offensive and have a hissy fit because he isn't who they thought he was.

Basically the equivalent of screaming at any other form of offensive comedy like South Park.

EDIT: Don't know why I'm getting downvoted. Because I used the word ""normies""? There really isn't another word to describe them."
1841,2020-06-28 04:59:22,hh5kfc,"Maybe I'm just not into YouTube anymore but I remember watching Shane Dawson when I was in middle/high school. So I'm sure his content had changed but...

A beauty guru? Who would even believe that...? 

I remember him talking about a meet up with fans and the recording of one of his fans chewing a piece of gum, then he chewed that piece of gum and then gave it back. 14 year old me found it funny, 23 year old me cringes hard. Its painfully obvious he just knows how to play the game, I dont see how he would be invested in anything like that."
1842,2020-06-28 03:34:32,hh5kfc,"To add on, he has apologized for some of this stuff before. But the internet keeps dredging it up every now and then, like him humping his cat. 

It's definitely one of those things he will have to deal with for the rest of his life."
1843,2020-06-28 02:09:55,hh5kfc,"Follow-up questions: 

a) How long ago did these incidents take place? 

b) I've seen talk on Twitter that he's also engaged in sexual harassment. However, I am unsure if this is true or not (haven't seen any direct accusations, etc). Can you speak as to whether or not this is true?"
1844,2020-06-28 05:56:30,hh5kfc,"There's no way the cat thing was serious, if he actually did that he'd keep it secret and not openly joke about it. I don't think it's funny at all and there's probably a grain of truth greatly exaggerated for comedic effect but no way is that story close to something he actually did.

Keep in mind i'm not a fan of his so it's not like I have reason to come up with excuses to defend him, it's just that's a terrible thing to accuse him of and clearly not true."
1845,2020-06-28 06:18:29,hh5kfc,Why was this person ever popular??? I just don’t see the appeal.
1846,2020-06-28 03:25:53,hh5kfc,The cat thing keeps coming up for some reason. It's been dealt with multiple times but people keep bringing it back up. People don't like him and they try and get him canceled like once a year.
1847,2020-06-28 05:48:06,hh5kfc,But what caused people to start caring about this now? Was it because other youtubers started apologizing? Did one of those other videos recently go viral again?

1850,2020-06-28 06:40:18,hh5kfc,... but do they call me Shane Dawson the bridge builder?  No!
1851,2020-06-28 02:13:47,hh5kfc,"Most of the blackface videos took place around 2010-2011, and I *think* the podcast with the cat incident was four years ago but don't quote me. I know most of these things from being subscribed to another subreddit that talked about him a lot due to his collab with Star but I had to dig to find out the dates. I can't confirm now because he deleted every single video on his main YouTube channel. 

I haven't seen or heard of any sexual allegations so that may or may not be true.

Edit: I did go on twitter and find a tweet showing a podcast where he tries to ""justify pedophilia.""

1852,2020-06-28 04:06:36,hh5kfc,"Uh no, I'm just talking from experience. I was a fan of ShaneDawsonTV when I was like 12 years old in 2011."
1853,2020-06-28 02:23:46,hh5kfc,"It sounds like rn there’s a major cancel wave going through YouTube. Jenna Marbles just quit and honestly her content has been totally chill for like 7-8 years. I know she did some racist stuff but I have to say I believed her when she said she changed.

I know next to nothing about Dawson, but unless he has done more recent shitty stuff, I’m thinking being canceled is over the top. But, I do know he only recently tried to cut ties with Starr who is utter garbage so I’m thinking he probs was trying to dodge the coming cancel wave."
1854,2020-06-28 02:28:01,hh5kfc,"If you have a Twitter you should check out some of the tweets about him. He's being cancelled because of his unapologetic friendship with Jeffree Star, who is known to be a bad person in almost every aspect you can think of. He's a whole other mess of research to read about.

Also, Jenna Marbles apologized for her offensive videos without being asked to because she genuinely feels bad about them. She has also talked about not feeling YouTube as much as she used to in her podcasts with her boyfriend so it could have also been a way for her to quit."
1855,2020-06-28 02:59:48,hh5kfc,"There has been more recent shitty stuff, a lot of which has to do with a potential part he and Jeffree Star played in the whole ""Bye Sisters"" scandal (or Dramageddon, whichever you prefer). It seems like a lot of people are starting to put patterns together of his behavior that has very much been overlooked. He has a multi year history of problematic content on youtube, much of which has been recently purged, and a lot of people came (or still come) to his defense based on his newer ""persona"" being a completely different person. However, this recent tweet where he constantly defends Jeffree for the exact same things he says James Charles needed to grow out of (this was one of the main points of the ""Bye Sisters"" scandal, at the time Jeffree and Shane were both and their 30s and James was 19. There is a lot to unpack there, especially since they are asking for a pass for things they said when they were young and stupid but will not give the same concessions to James) seems to be the straw that broke the camel's back for many, myself included. He consistently surrounds himself with deeply problematic people and chooses to use his platform to help them clear up their image publicly (see his Tana and Jake Paul series). He puts on this persona of being poor and relatable while living in a huge mansion in Calabasas and it comes off as disingenuous. So there wasn't really one very problematic thing recently but more of a revealing of lots of problematic things that people have given him a pass for. He has apologized for parts of these things but his image in the youtube community is definitely shifting."
1856,2020-06-28 03:09:31,hh5kfc,"I know very little about both Dawson and Jenna, but my ex watched videos of both for years so I saw/heard a fair bit. Jenna was fine, but Shane always rubbed me the wrong way. It sucks that Jenna had to end things this way, she didn't even monetize her channel. She just kept doing it because she enjoyed it."
1857,2020-06-28 06:20:29,hh5kfc,This reads like the script for a TV show about high school drama that is targeted at elementary school kids.
1858,2020-06-28 04:05:20,hh5kfc,"My thoughts exactly! She and her boyfriend clearly are in love, adore their dogs, and love making silly and cute videos with the dogs. It felt super inoffensive. It’s hard to not see that she actually changed her content a lot to be very inclusive and wholesome"
1859,2020-06-28 05:00:59,hh5kfc,"Honestly, Jenna's recent content felt to me like her heart wasn't in the channel anymore. I think she already wanted to step back."
1860,2020-06-28 06:32:35,hh5kfc,"Honestly, I'm not sure how many people were even trying to call her out before her decision to step back from YouTube. It seemed to me more like she felt genuinely uncomfortable about her early work, and just wasn't having as much fun making YouTube content anymore."
1861,2020-06-28 06:28:23,hh5kfc,"Yeah, I really didn't see much 'cancel' type pressure on her leading up to the video where she stepped back from YouTube. It seemed more like she was genuinely uncomfortable about some of her early content, and just wasn't having fun making videos anymore."
1862,2020-06-28 06:29:24,hh5kfc,"I couldn't agree more tbh. I think she was tired and cancelled herself, and I don't blame her. Some of her old videos were not great, and that level of fame on Youtube for that many years has to be draining. She has her money, her dogs, and her boyfriend - she doesn't need to keep doing something that she doesn't feel good about."

1866,2020-06-27 21:53:22,hh29n8,"Agreed. The video was vile anyway, Jada has tweeted too, no hiding now."
1867,2020-06-27 22:00:40,hh29n8,I’m curious to see if YouTube/ Susan does something now considering how influential celebrities like Will have become in the integration of YouTube and mainstream Hollywood
1868,2020-06-27 22:44:24,hh29n8,I don't think they will do anything  because I believe the video was always on his channel and it was just now brought into the conversation but i could be wrong.

Could Paramount and WB have come to a similar agreement, as Wilson Cruz & Anthony Rapp are actors from Star Trek Discovery."
1873,2020-08-15 17:57:51,ia6qzd,i’ve lived long enough to see john cena in a DC movie. my life is complete

1880,2020-08-15 16:07:58,ia6qzd,Terry Crews? This has to be for The Suicide Squad— or maybe a voice on the game of it? Or a role in Black Adam?
1881,2020-08-15 17:40:55,ia6qzd,"Mark Strong - Dr Sivana, Sinestro*"

I'm a DC fan from Russia. We unfortunately have very few DC fans. But the popular marvel. I really want to make my favorite DC universe popular in Russia. So I want to ask you what exactly do you like most about DC? What is your favorite character? I really want to focus on the coolness of DC in our social networks and forums and make DC as popular in Russia as you do. Thank you"

1892,2020-08-16 10:07:10,ia6qzd,Henry Winkler is definitively the one I’m most curious to see
1893,2020-08-15 23:28:41,ia6qzd,"Ron Funches & Alan Tudyk are both in Harley Quinn, however they were in another live action DC property together on NBC that will be debuting new episodes digitally, on HBO Max."
1894,2020-08-15 17:59:44,ia6qzd,Paramount and WB came together many times. Interstellar is one of them.
1895,2020-08-15 13:59:03,ia6qzd,So paramount would make the comics for wb movies?
1896,2020-08-15 23:34:44,ia6qzd,"Or, as both are boadway actors, with Darren Criss returning as the Music Meister, there is a sequel coming to Duet."

1898,2020-08-17 19:07:33,ia6qzd,Nice
1899,2020-08-16 01:56:48,ia6qzd,but why?
1900,2020-08-15 17:23:49,ia6qzd,no offence to them but they are not even b list actors. Troian maybe considering her family connections.
1901,2020-08-15 14:01:51,ia6qzd,Now that the filters seem to be working there is a 5 minute documentary about The Joker
1902,2020-08-18 05:33:48,ia6qzd,holy 0 _ 0
1903,2020-08-16 00:16:47,ia6qzd,My bet is Black Adam.
1904,2020-08-19 05:52:26,ia6qzd,Could just be a host
1905,2020-08-16 17:58:06,ia6qzd,Lol. Such a wonderful actor!!
1906,2020-08-15 15:12:58,ia6qzd,"Ray: Oh.... Hi Geoff. Didn't know you were going to be here...

Great username by the way. Made me chuckle."
1907,2020-08-15 14:41:35,ia6qzd,"After all the stuff he’s done, not likely"
1908,2020-08-16 22:52:24,ia6qzd,"After what he did with Watchmen, they're likely to let him do whatever. I think he'd be good to do something from Vertigo."
1909,2020-08-16 22:53:00,ia6qzd,Powerless? He's also Mr. Nobody from Doom Patrol.
1910,2020-08-15 18:06:48,ia6qzd,Plus CBS & WB own CW together
1911,2020-08-16 05:54:32,ia6qzd,Studios do this all the time. Usually one studio handles the distribution outside of the US and the other inside the US.
1912,2020-08-15 14:00:30,ia6qzd,Just speculating there maybe some sort of crossover with Star Trek Discovery
1913,2020-08-19 05:50:38,ia6qzd,Posters and other misc. Mostly black Adam
1914,2020-08-15 19:10:52,ia6qzd,"Yeah, honestly, I'm hoping for some kind of confirmation so badly that I'm seeing things where there is most likely nothing important.
They're probably just lending their voices to some project of some kind."
1915,2020-08-16 22:51:00,ia6qzd,"Interesting. Could he be a race-bend of a JSA character? If so, my bet is Dr. Mid-Nite (Charles McNider was played by a black guy in Legends of Tomorrow)."

1917,2020-08-15 15:28:49,ia6qzd,Geoff's panel is also cancelled
1918,2020-08-15 14:06:57,ia6qzd,"Or their just using the actors, i dont see starvtrek crossing over withanything"
1919,2020-08-16 23:01:11,ia6qzd,Another possibility is Mister Terrific.
1920,2020-08-19 05:52:16,ia6qzd,What about bended wildcat
1921,2020-08-15 16:05:11,ia6qzd,He'll be at stargirl and the three jokers panel I think
1922,2020-08-15 17:23:39,ia6qzd,Link?
1923,2020-08-15 16:06:54,ia6qzd,Oh shit! For real?!
1924,2020-08-16 23:11:33,ia6qzd,Hmm. That's another possibility. I can see it.
1925,2020-08-19 06:14:10,ia6qzd,"That could work too. Arrow had Ted Grant as a Latino man, so it's not like it's never been done before."
1926,2020-08-15 20:27:01,ia6qzd,And if there's any Green Lantern announcement he'll likely be there as he's involved with that series.
1927,2020-08-16 14:23:01,ia6qzd,Its not there in the schedule of dc fandome
1928,2020-08-16 16:21:36,ia6qzd,So no proof then? Like at all...
1929,2020-08-11 18:22:37,i7x0sh,ok
1930,2020-08-11 18:23:54,i7x0sh,I see slipknot...i'll listen to this song

1932,2020-08-11 18:25:16,i7x0sh,Why
1933,2020-08-11 18:47:01,i7x0sh,"You are the ""I don't listen to mainstream music"" person. Anyways check out nothing last by bedroom. Similar style"
1934,2020-08-11 18:33:08,i7x0sh,They have better songs imo but this one is nice
1935,2020-08-11 18:25:55,i7x0sh,it’s just suggestions... you don’t have to...
1936,2020-08-11 18:48:47,i7x0sh,"nope, i love mainstream music. ariana grande and melanie martinez are my top artists but whenever i post about them, i get downvoted"
1937,2020-08-11 18:26:40,i7x0sh,Ok sure but I had a stroke trying to read the names of these songs
1938,2020-08-11 18:53:14,i7x0sh,Either way ur gonna get down voted cuz of sterotypes and starter pack memes
1939,2020-08-11 18:28:50,i7x0sh,which ones 😔
1940,2020-08-11 18:30:37,i7x0sh,The last three
1941,2020-08-11 18:37:14,i7wo6c,"Like Nick Wilde? I don't like that power. Although it's certainly in character... Maybe her vines whip around and clear emoji? https://youtu.be/DjigYxfSWI8?t=83

I wish she had been the level 500 prize instead of a Minnie variant."
1942,2020-08-11 20:42:35,i7wo6c,"Nick’s power changed: originally he highlighted matches, now he makes the matches for you."
1943,2020-08-11 20:50:29,i7wo6c,"Yes, I am desperate for one considering the game knows I don't have any Pocahontas emojis and two of only three are buried deep in the gold box, so they give me at least one mission per level. But also, I just love that movie. We also need new silver emojis, and I think Thomas as a less prevalent character would be good for that as well as Percy."
1944,2020-08-12 12:15:31,i7wo6c,They are on my wishlist! I would also add Chief Powathan.
1945,2020-08-12 15:31:11,i7wo6c,"If they add it as a villain event, they could add Governor Radcliffe too!"
1946,2020-08-11 18:39:03,i7wo6c,Me too

**Buyers and sellers, use the link above to verify where to redeem codes to ensure 4K codes redeem properly.**

**Feedback Logging (*Does not apply to GIVEAWAYS*)**

* Once a transaction has been completed, one user (buyer or seller) must create a comment (can be in-line with the deal discussion) tagging both [u/DCSbot](https://www.reddit.com/u/DCSbot) and the user they transacted with, for example  u\/IamtheZZ.
 * The u/ is required, and the username for the bot ***MUST BE TYPED NOT COPY/PASTED*** to work properly.
* Once this is done, the tagged user must respond to that comment for feedback to be logged.
* If successful, the bot will respond to the second comment with ""Added"", and the number will increment for both.

All discussions/negotiations about a potential transaction must be made via comments. Exchange codes/payment via PM or Reddit Chat. This helps to prevent scams and track trusted buyers and sellers.  **DO NOT RESPOND TO OFFERS MADE VIA PM OR CHAT.**

I remember being so so disgusted at the blatant misogyny that was the basis of their videos, really rapey stuff. It seems they’ve been wiped from the internet because I can’t find them anywhere."
2219,2020-08-05 03:25:58,i3vafl,"Remember folks, the dudes who made this currently make Kids React, which is gross when you think about the big picture."

2222,2020-08-05 07:12:19,i3vafl,"He also constantly sexualized Miley Cyrus, Rebecca Black too."
2223,2020-08-05 08:19:12,i3vafl,"She was viral at the time. Same with Rebecca Black and Miley. They were all subjects of going viral and overall ridicule. Anything Shane did at the time was to sexualise. That was his ‘brand’, although brand consciousness wasn’t rly a thing back then. Suppose his ‘niche’ or ‘thing’. Not saying it was right tho."
2224,2020-08-05 03:17:16,i3vafl,How do I unsee that video?
2225,2020-08-05 11:48:47,i3vafl,"I'm not defending Shane at all with this but paradys like this were crazy popular back then there were even worse ones from other channels not as big as Shane that were even more racist. I know a lot of my friends in middle school lovvved these videos and I don't think any of them felt like it was sexual on purpose, it was like haha sex and farts is funny because we were all immature. I actually remember watching this video with friends and thought it was the shit. I obviously think differently now and I think Shane and the fine Bros needs to address their content and can't let this slide. But kids at that time said the stupidest shit and I think Shane and the fine Bros were just copying them to get them to watch their videos. YouTube didn't make much money then for YouTubers and I actually think Shane and the fine Bros are super socially inept and probably thought that having kids laugh at/with you meant they were liked. They probably were bullied or some shit and realized that with the internet they can make ""friends"" from other like-minded people and when you get a ton of like minded stupid people together things that are socially wrong get thrown out there because they all think it's right and no one is telling them otherwise. Now that the kids are all grown up we can see how disgusting these videos are"
2226,2020-08-05 14:26:05,i3vafl,"Okay, but can we talk about the creepy situations that Willow’s parents put her in."
2227,2020-08-05 05:23:36,i3vafl,"I'm not forgiving anything, but her own parents have allowed many things, past shane, to be sexualized. Why are they not also being held to the same standards?"
2228,2020-08-05 15:19:06,i3vafl,omg wait arent the fine bros also the ones that do the kids/teens react vids??
2229,2020-08-05 05:30:58,i3vafl,"Her own parents pimped her out. Or is having a 13 yr old pose with a half naked man in his 20's not count?   They are just as bad, if not worse, than he is."
2230,2020-08-05 03:37:30,i3vafl,Men are so toxic I cannot believe all 3(?) of them somehow made me believe they were wholesome

2247,2020-08-10 09:12:40,i3vafl,So disturbing. Haven’t heard about this until now.
2248,2020-08-09 16:52:33,i3vafl,"You're right - Shane Dawson is racist, and Shanaynay is one of his characters that just happens to be a massive stereotype."

2255,2020-08-05 16:04:06,i3vafl,Wow I just checked the comments of rylands video.. wild. How can people defend someone like that? Are those all girls that were groomed by his videos?
2256,2020-08-05 18:13:35,i3vafl,Nobody should be de-platformed. Genuinely.
2257,2020-08-07 20:49:58,i3vafl,No worries!
2258,2020-08-05 16:22:37,i3vafl,"It's honestly hard to say, definitely some sort of manipulation going on of him just seeming sympathetic and ""truly sorry"" (I haven't actually seen Ryland's video but im guessing it's that kind of stuff)"

2260,2020-08-05 16:27:44,i3vafl,I didnt watch it either.  Honestly I didn't know who jefree star and tati were until deangelos video.  I knew of Shane but didn't know all of this until deangelos video.  Deangelos video on shane made me want to scratch my eyes out.  Ugh
2261,2020-08-05 23:51:51,i3vafl,"When I said everyone, I meant it. People who did pedophillic grooming in the past? (Which Shane did not do). When I said everyone that would include people who are still doing it today."
2262,2020-08-05 16:52:58,i3vafl,"I actually was a fan of Shane's starting in maybe 2016? I liked some of his docuseries and the first one on Jeffree was how I learned who he was and like that series made Jeffree seem kinda sympathetic but I still never liked him and the whole bye sister thing of last year I kept up to date with and that was how I learned who Tati was and these grown ass adults need to stop focusing on James Charles. D'Angelo's video opened my eyes a bit like I knew Shane did like black face and I stuff but I was like ""oh he changed he's a good person now!"" And believed his apologies about not being a pedo. After seeing the shit on Twitter and especially after D'Angelo's video, I 100% he is a pedophile. I certainly hope he's never acted on it but he definitely thinks like that"

2267,2020-08-02 18:24:40,i2gc5k,Clint was a phenomenal villain. Totally deserves to return
2268,2020-08-02 18:44:28,i2gc5k,"Love how Gregory was the clear villain of the pre-jury, making enemies left and right while Willie managed to remain UTR and almost, almost reign supreme. Gotta say, my boy Willie? Deserves a second chance one day.

This was an enjoyable season to read. It was.. all over the place, really, but it was very entertaining. Shannon, SS, James, Clint, Willie and Jarobi should return in a future season."
2269,2020-08-03 00:57:22,i2gc5k,"I'm happy that 2 of my 3 characters managed to make the final 3. Damn, James was so close to winning. I did find his constant flipping to be a funny theme this season. Nigel was also alright, he didn't do much for me. And Willow got screwed by the rock draw. Hopefully James or Nigel returns for the future."

We only have one tiny Zimbabwe and bloodshed won’t deliver us to where we want to go. Truth and reconciliation is required for us to truely remove the shackles that have held us back. Black white coloured Indian Asian we are Zimbabwean if we were born here. We need to accept that the sum of us is greater than them. Together they are a minority. We need to embrace developmental agendas and deal with the issues of reparation and forgiveness. 

Zimbabwe is ours. It doesn’t belong to anyone else than the children born here. Once we realise that and accept that we are as much of the problem as the solution, it is a war we can fight with the least number of casualties and the greatest success. 

War breed war. Coups breed coups"

2280,2020-08-03 12:32:08,i0l38q,"The odds of a revolution succeeding are so tremendously low, But I would have some questions on the revolution:

1) Even if we successfully did topple somehow the ZanuPF government, they'd still be the wealthiest people in a democratic state so would quickly regain control of all the levers of the economy and likely do well in the first election.  How is that an improvement?

2)The military and police are all Zanu supporters so you'd be having a revolution, with no government or police and no economy.  Who is going to fund this thing?

3)  The entire region would back Zanu.  1 because they are all liberation parties together and 2 because they were democratically elected and they have international obligations to.  How would it look for other democratic nations next door to support a undemocratic widespread revolution?

4) What are the objectives of the revolution?  What are the goals of this war?  Remove Zanu, ok, then what? What plan is in place to run a functioning nation?  Will we not get more sanctions for having an undemocratic coup?

5)  Revolution to do what?  What is it that we are going to DO after the revolution that we cannot currently do now and why?

6) Most countries that have 1 undemocratic revolution have multiple subsequent ones.  How do we deal with the issue that at some point people will become frustrated with the revolution and long for the more stable days of the past and launch a counter revolution?

7) "" when everyone has absolute equality under the law. If there is selective use of constitutional laws, there can never be a win against Zanu by the constitution.  ""  

Who specifically, currently does not have absolute equality under the law that you propose we extend it to?

8) "" They had no property, no cars, no families of their own, and no foreseeable future under the smith regime, and so they went to war""

It was more than just being poor, it was WHY they were poor, the Smith regime and previous ones had stolen land from an agarian Native group of people who had a history of fighting wars over land.  It is no surprise it led to another war.  More importantly, how is the revolution going to solve this, every arab spring state economy has gotten worse since the uprising"
2281,2020-08-04 20:22:04,i0l38q,"Everytime I try to think of a way out of this I find myself  in a corner there seems to be no way out except to go the violent and terrible war path
What you are saying is true
We are down pressed and closed in from all sides 
Part of me keeps hoping that there is a peaceful way out of this 
Civil war starts an endless cycle of violence like in other African countries like Sudan so its really tricky 
Indeed a war is coming 
One day we will all reach a breaking point

2284,2020-07-30 16:47:19,i0l38q,"The US had good “propaganda” against racism and social justice though. I’m calling it propaganda because some of the stuff turns to be political talking points that can move ones emotions, but probably don’t hold evidence. Most liberal arts colleges in the states really make an effort in furthering this propaganda , and so when a trigger moment like an unarmed black man being killed happens , the people are ready.
I think because of the army, we still feel we have something to lose . Personally, I don’t call anyone who refuses to stand against the Zanu army a coward, we’ve seen what they can do, and I think it’s understandable that people are genuinely afraid"

As to the current widespread support for Zanu, it’s all a matter of propaganda tbh, it’s not as if the supporters are rich"

So how do you think we can reach this shared vision. I think we had a chance to do that after 2017 coup, but they have failed. I, as well as a lot of other people, had hope that this was indeed a new day for Zimbabwe. But they’ve proven that they can’t reform themselves"

2297,2020-07-30 13:00:02,i0l38q,Honestly I guess it is just war. Human beings have been going to war for centuries. This whole concept of having to live in harmony while resources are scarce and unevenly distributed over the past decades is false. This is because it is human nature to conquer so as to survive it's the instinct in us. So war it is
2298,2020-08-03 12:11:22,i0l38q,"How about work to reform the party and work to improve the country ourselves and stop blaming Zanu PF for all our problems.  Even if we do stage this hypothetical war, despite Zanu being extremely popular in rural areas but hated by whites and disliked by the urbans, even if we win, no guarantee it would be any better.  Look at Libya and Iraq and all the arab spring states, even winning is worse than the old status quo of those nations.  The most likely outcome is Zim will have international support due to it being a democracy and having no major oil reserves, being landlocked and no one wanting to invade it.  South Africa doesn't want a wave of millions of Zim refugees."

2301,2020-07-30 17:12:34,i0l38q,"Yeah, but my speculation is we’re getting to that point of no return, and to be quite honest, I think now we really need some strong opposition propaganda. I believe Chamisa could’ve done it, he is a good talker, because honestly if one clearly breaks down why Zanu has to go and why and how they are stopping progress to Zanu supporters, they might stop supporting, unless of course they are beneficiaries of the system"
2302,2020-07-30 13:02:06,i0l38q,"Word, but I don’t think it has to be like war war fought in the streets and all, I guess what I mean by war is an unconstitutional method of grabbing power. With the right propaganda, the whole country can turn against the few leaders and maybe some soldiers can turn against them as well"

2304,2020-08-03 12:30:54,i0l38q,"And no we can’t stop blaming Zanu PF for our problems, that’s the source of our problems, if you do your research well you’d realize that. We need reforms , they can’t reform because their existence as a party and as an establishment is fueled by a broken system, fix the system, the establishment falls, they know it, and so they won’t . They’ll just keep throwing propaganda about “kutengesa nyika kuvarungu” and all that other bullshit"
2305,2020-07-30 21:26:01,i0l38q,"Hmm, look at the case with the doctors, they downed tools asking for basic things for public health, and they didn’t do much, or anything at all. I’m sure they can find a way to fund themselves, diamonds, mines, something. Also, this assumes there are no businesses which benefit from the current system, I think (without evidence) some of the biggest businesses or most, have some Zanu person involved. Could work though"
2306,2020-07-30 13:09:47,i0l38q,That's by definition a revolution

All those arab countries where they did what he advocates are complete clusterfook s-holes worse than Zimbabwe sadly. Look at what Libya went to, to what it is now"
2309,2020-08-03 13:47:14,i0l38q,"I agree they are a major contributing factor but we can work around them and fix our economy. The best way to fix the system is to reform it so there is no more corruption in it.  Corruption is harming the economy.

Here’s the thing, I don’t like war, it’s dangerous, a revolution might, rather probably will cost lives. We don’t even know if by removing Zanu we can put someone better. But at a certain point you have to come to the realization that we are not going anywhere under Zanu, just look at the health system . People are dying everyday day because of covid , because our health system is already overwhelmed at what, 3000 covid cases? Come on now, the people on top are ungovernable, they don’t care about us, they don’t care about the lives of people. And don’t you tell me that the government is broke, just look at where they are spending money, all the corruption, buying cars for ministers who are not doing anything. It’s lunacy to think that the same group of people who have failed the country for 40 years will do anything to make it better now."
2312,2020-08-03 13:52:31,i0l38q,"HOW DO WE THE PEOPLE REFORM A SYSTEM WE CAN NOT CONTROL! Only they can reform it, and I’ve highlighted that that can’t and they won’t , so if you want reform you have to remove them"
2313,2020-08-03 20:35:12,i0l38q,"That will just play into ZanuPF hand about colonial forces from UK and USA out to destroy the nation.  I agree things are bad, we disagree over the solution.  We are broke because the corruption at the top spending our money on cars instead of proper healthcare and education.

We must reform Zanu, the problem why it doesn't get reformed is people who oppose Zanu not only want reform but they propose crazy reforms like $4 billion compensation to white farmers,the whole world is laughing at us.  That doesn't erase our abuse of protesters, human rights, etc.  This is just zanu trying to get a new slush fund."

2327,2020-07-28 05:15:10,hyycsr,I randomly hear my name being called out in a females voice. I lost my fiance and daughter back in 2005 and I firmly believe it's her trying to get my attention from the otherside. Sometimes they are clear as day and other it sounds far away but clear. It still happens once to three times a week

You see, it's always about manipulation with these entities. It answered to something that you were not even aware of saying. You were supposed to go check the meaning and say: ""Oh, wow, I can't have imagined that, since I didn't even know what the line meant. So there must be some spirit trying to communicate with me. How exciting is that!"" Something like this. And in case some half-witted user feels to ask: so the entity is supposed to have known what that avatar sentence meant? The answer is yes. Non-material entites have easy access to anything you know, even subconsciously. Communication=interaction=acceptance=permission. My advice is to ignore it. I wish you well."

The second time was when I asked my son if he wanted to get a coolata from Dunkin donuts, just as I asked I heard a man say not to go. I didn't listen.

I Really Wish I cld remember the apps name. What freaked me out about my experience with the App was that it wld always respond by saying words in a computerized robotic type of a voice. So one day while I was listening back to the words spoken through this App I suddenly hear am actual voice that I actually recognized & knew! And a voice that I knew very well It freaked me out more than I have been in so very long. When I realized that this in fact was the voice of my recently departed Fiance who had just passed, just barely passed away 6 months prior. I knew for a fact that this was impossible as this was recorded off of my brand new cell phone that I had just barely purchased after he had already passed away so I was extremely shocked but also I felt very touched but this had also made me realize that he was communicating with me even after death from beyond the grave. It just made me love & miss him even more than I already did!! This loss in fact has been the biggest heartache I've ever EXPERIENCED in all of my LIFE time!!!"

**Buyers and sellers, use the link above to verify where to redeem codes to ensure 4K codes redeem properly.**

**Feedback Logging (*Does not apply to GIVEAWAYS*)**

* Once a transaction has been completed, one user (buyer or seller) must create a comment (can be in-line with the deal discussion) tagging both [u/DCSbot](https://www.reddit.com/u/DCSbot) and the user they transacted with, for example  u\/IamtheZZ.
 * The u/ is required, and the username for the bot ***MUST BE TYPED NOT COPY/PASTED*** to work properly.
* Once this is done, the tagged user must respond to that comment for feedback to be logged.
* If successful, the bot will respond to the second comment with ""Added"", and the number will increment for both.

All discussions/negotiations about a potential transaction must be made via comments. Exchange codes/payment via PM or Reddit Chat. This helps to prevent scams and track trusted buyers and sellers.  **DO NOT RESPOND TO OFFERS MADE VIA PM OR CHAT.**

As far as I know, CW have had nothing to do with producing season 1. However, the CW will be producing season 2 and I believe it will release exclusively on the CW."

If you post years of racist and pedophilic content, you have to expect this to happen. If anything, he’s the one who ruined his life by acting so careless as to what he put out there. Also, black face isn’t a mistake."
2506,2020-07-23 02:47:04,hw6iaf,A mistake? It’s an ongoing pattern..
2507,2020-07-23 02:09:53,hw6iaf,"You clearly haven't seen everything he's done. It's not just jokes. He used actual children in his videos and sexually exploited them. They have names, faces they're actual children. Not just a general joke about a child. That is where my biggest issues is. And he obviously doesn't understand how that's bad either, those videos stayed up until very recently when everyone started to notice and say something. He's had years to take them down and apologize but he didn't. Why? He doesn't think it's truly wrong. And he was still gaining profit from those and the racist 'jokes'. He still even had merch in regards to the one black character up. He needs to be held accountable for all these things. When you involve children, I'm sorry but that's a whole other level of sick in my opinion."
2508,2020-07-23 03:00:47,hw6iaf,He ruined his own life
2509,2020-07-23 02:12:04,hw6iaf,"I don’t think Shane is a racist or a pedophile, but he has participated in racist and pedophilic behaviour and for that deserves to lose his career. The people claiming he needs to go to jail and lose friends and lose Ryland are super toxic though."
2510,2020-07-23 02:19:20,hw6iaf,If you or me did blackface or sexual jokes towards/with a child our career would be over in a minute. jobs gone. im sorry but you clearly don’t understand the gravity of how he disturbing and disgusting his actions are...just because you’re insecure that doesn’t mean you do racist things or exhibit predatory behavior. you cant just say what he did isn’t a big deal. just because his racism isn’t at the level of the KKK doesn’t make it okay... it’s still horrible. also he’s an adult. he wasn’t some stupid child who didn’t know what he’s doing. they’re also not mistakes. mistakes are something you do on accident. repeated racist and predatory actions aren’t mistakes especially when you’re an adult who knows right from wrong. please take time to educate yourself more on what he’s done and understand peoples’ perspective. don’t make excuses for him.
2511,2020-07-23 02:19:22,hw6iaf,"well if you build a platform off of racist, pedophilic, and transphobic jokes and then use that platform later on to stigmatize mentally ill people, spread damaging misinformation, protect other known bigots, misrepresent domestic abuse allegations, and make major bank off all of it too, then maybe you don’t deserve to have a platform right now. We’re not ruining his life, he made these choices on his own. (All this stuff is what he’s publicly uploaded too, not even getting into the stuff behind the scenes)"
2512,2020-07-23 14:11:13,hw6iaf,"I don't think people want to ruin his life, he just needs a slice of humble pie"
2513,2020-07-23 03:54:27,hw6iaf,And Jenna is nowhere near Shane. She made mistakes. Few of them . And she listened and learnt and became a wonderful advocate for many different minorities. As is Julian.
2514,2020-07-23 04:14:38,hw6iaf,"It's dangerous to pass this sort of thing off as a simple mistake. No, he was a grown man who knew exactly what he was doing, not a child or even a teenager. I would also argue he is nowhere near as sensitive as he portrays. Watch him berating people in The Chair and tell me he's still an uwu empath.

The fact that you didn't get offended doesn't mean other people didn't. Another reason people are angry is because he clearly hasn't changed at all, profiting off his racist material fairly recently. The fact that the last makeup series showed one of those characters at one point shows he isn't truly guilty at all. I think he's proud of it. Then there's all the creepy kid stuff I continue to be amazed people are eager to overlook. Why are we ruining Shane's life? Why did Shane think it was okay to post that stuff? Why shouldn't we call out someone's questionable behaviour? Really look at everything Shane's done and ask yourself if this is the kind of person you want to support."
2515,2020-07-23 10:50:52,hw6iaf,"That may be the case, however I find it hard to feel bad for a multi millionaire. Even if his YouTube career gets ruined, he has more than enough money to retire and live a comfortable life regardless.

As for the black face, while he did it a long time ago, he was still an adult and if he didn’t know it was bad, he wouldn’t have done it for “shock humor.” He wasn’t some idiot teenager back then and I feel like people need to remember that. It wasn’t just once either, but MANY times. I think he was stupid in the sense that he lacked the hindsight to see why it would be a bad idea, however there’s no way he couldn’t have known the history. Even if he somehow didn’t learn about it in school, plenty of people were still up in arms back then about him doing it and were trying to educate him. He just didn’t care. 

As for whether he has grown, I don’t think he has. Just look at all the racists he’s friends with. Birds of a feather flock together. He also said in the podcast Jaclyn Glenn was in that he changed up his content because he was tired of getting demonetized or something like that, not because he regretted it.  Not to mention that he could have used his platform to uplift POC creators, yet he settled with only collaborating with already famous problematic white people, one of which he framed a racist as sympathetic. That’s just what we see publicly, so I bet his  racism is worse behind the scenes. All in all, I think he’s really good at manipulating people into thinking he’s changed. I don’t think he has a genuine bone in his body and as heartless as it sounds, I mean it when I say I don’t feel sorry for him and I do the best I can to be an understanding and forgiving person. Obviously, I wouldn’t want him to hurt or kill himself, though."
2516,2020-07-23 15:06:38,hw6iaf,"The issue with Shane, and anyone creating content on a social media platform, is that an integral part of their success and career sustainability is built on parasocial relationships with their audience. It is up to the content creator to produce content that is appropriate for their audience and that isn't encouraging any negative and damaging behaviours and mindsets (racism, homophobia, pedophilia etc.). 

Throughout Shane's career as a content creator on YouTube he has consistently shown that he cannot be trusted to make content that is appropriate for the demographic for his audience. When he's been called out for it, he's openly admitted that he's not made genuine apologies for his behaviour. He knows that due to the parasocial relationship he has manufactured with his audience that he can create a blanket apology and they will take it at face value because he's in a position of power. I strongly refute the claim that Shane intended to create content ""for free"" - he saw that the YouTube algorithm was in his favour, got friendly with Susan Wojcicki, and knew he had a career lined up for himself and took it. That kind of power goes straight to people's heads and feeds the ego that tells them they can do no wrong. 

Shane made a stupid YouTube video that cost him and his family members at the same company their jobs. No more regular paycheck means no more regular income to pay rent with, to pay bills with, to buy food with. The YouTube algorithm favoured his content in a stroke of luck and suddenly he has the opportunity to make money off the platform. Anyone who has ever had the all consuming anxiety of not having a regular income knows that when you see an opportunity to make money, you take it and you run. When your options are job searching and having your potential employer do a background check and find your dumb YouTube video, or using YouTube's partner programme to make and monetize content, it's a no brainer. So Shane took YouTube and ran with it as fast as he fucking could. And look at what he got away with. 

Now, everything is subjective, and his old videos may not have been considered offensive or damaging for everyone watching them. But there have been countless people who have come forward and said that Shane's content has negatively affected their perspective and muddied the waters on what is acceptable and what isn't, especially in regards to relationships. 

For example, Shane including minors in his old videos and forcing them to do sexually explicit things is an abuse of his power as an adult. Young people lack critical thinking skills and can't see content creators for what they are, or their true intentions. So because it's an adult doing this behaviour, it's okay for adults for ask them to do these types of things too. 

There's a difference between setting out with the intention to ruin someone's life and calling someone out for their behaviour and asking them to take accountability and genuinely apologize for their actions. This is the internet and I don't doubt some people are going out there with the intention to ruin Shane's life. That's just how the internet works.

There's a huge difference between a genuine apology and a manufactured one. A genuine apology needs to acknowledge that their actions (with examples) have hurt their audience, apologize for doing so, and as such set out clear actions for how they are going to change. I've said it before somewhere on this subreddit but Shane needs to leave YouTube, get into therapy and actually want to do the work required to address his very evident issues. YouTube clearly sets off something in him and reinforces negative behaviour, so if he was to return I have no doubt he'd slip back into his old ways extremely quickly."
2517,2020-07-23 03:48:20,hw6iaf,"If he didnt at least somewhat believe in the *jokes* then why would he say them over and over, for years and years. This isnt a case of a few badly placed jokes over the years, its extremely hurtful, consistent, repetitive behaviour.."
2518,2020-07-23 02:41:08,hw6iaf,"I understand that you love him. Sometimes, when people love others, they make excuses for behaviors that they would not normally approve of. 

I'm saying this as gently as I can: I suggest looking at the actual evidence of him exploiting children. 

Also, racism can't get a pass, and saying someone isn't as bad as the KKK doesn't mean that he isn't still a racist. Perhaps he hasn't lynched anyone, but his actions and words have been racist, and they contribute to the systemic issues that minorities face. Children/teens that idolize him were exposed to terrible, racist ways of thinking and acting that makes it seem like it's okay to do blackface, or say racial slurs. It's just not. 

There is something wrong with his head, and I would encourage you to try and take distance from your love for him and educate yourself on the bad things he has done. If you have educated yourself on those things, then I don't know how you can give him a pass. I doubt much will change your mind if you already know about his sexual harassment, potential beastiality, and many moments of racism, and choose to still support him."
2519,2020-07-24 16:50:25,hw6iaf,"1. ""No human is perfect"". No but most people don't do disturbing things to animals or ask disturbing things from minors (these have been caught in camera). Most people's mistakes have been something like: Cheated gf, said something mean to a friend etc.
2. ""Who hasn't made wildly inappropriate jokes?"" Like making jokes about raping kids or making black ppl look dumb? Most sane people dont.
3. "" When Shane did blackface do people honestly believe that he wanted to do it to be racist? He was younger and he made a **mistake.** People are treating Shane as if he's committed mass murder or a KKK member and trying to de-platform him. Why? ""This whole sentence DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. Only people forgiving him is his white teen fans. MISTAKE is something you do ONCE and you learn from it. He kept doing it. Also you can be racist even if you haven't KILLED a black person wtf?

So no. No one but Shane himself is ruining him. Oh and here if you don't believe me:

2520,2020-07-24 23:19:32,hw6iaf,"*When Shane did blackface do people honestly believe that he wanted to do it to be racist?* Yes. There's literally no non-racist reasons to do blackface. It's a racist act. I don't know why that needs to be explained to you. 

*People are treating Shane as if he's committed mass murder or a KKK member and trying to de-platform him. Why?*  Because people don't deserve to be rich and famous for being racist. Maybe it seems like they're going overboard to you because you're a fan of him and therefore biased.

*Imagine thousands of strangers berating and trying to ruin your life over mistakes you made several years ago when your intent was to entertain people for free.* Racism and p\*dophilia aren't entertaining and he was old enough to know that. Imagine thousands of strangers enabling you to keep up that kind of disgusting behavior for years and giving you money for it. Yikes.

He made shit-tier edgy 7th-grade humor like a decade ago.  No one here has ever looked back at themselves and cringed hard?  No, just me? okay then.

Like yall didnt know shit about j* either, give me a break.

this sub and /r/beautyguruchatter are filled with people who never left (or are still in) highschool in their own minds.  Anything for some ""tea,"" right?

Yikes."
2524,2020-07-23 06:10:33,hw6iaf,"tbh I think there are a good chunk of people who genuinely do want to fuck up his life. not anywhere near a majority or anything. but I've seen a lot of pretty awful things being said. But that can be said about any topic about any person. internet be scary.

not the point I came to make tho! I just wanted to chime in that I assume referring to Shane's choices as a mistake didn't mean ""ah shit I accidentally did black face, my bad"" but more in the way (and please forgive my comparison, I know they aren't at all the same thing, but I can't think of a better one rn) you would say ""oh dating that asshole was a mistake"" like yeah, you didn't just stumble into a relationship with em, it was a choice you made knowingly, but after living through it and realizing things you didn't know in the past, it's a choice you regret and look back on as something you shouldn't have done.

So a mistake in the way that Shane was ignorant and dumb back then and did something terrible, and since then I assume (idk. he hasn't post that content anymore. don't know what he does off camera) that he came to understand it was fucked up and that's why he stopped.

which is valid! like, it doesn't excuse his behavior in any capacity. it was just as fucked up then as it is now. and it's still fucked up whether or not he's changed his ways. but as people we learn and grow and making stupid awful choices that you look back on and regret is pretty normal. I know a lot of people who used to call people retarded as an insult or throw around the f slur before realizing that shit isn't okay and that those words hold weight, and then working to take it out of their vocabulary.


whether or not SHANE grew and fixed his behavior is definitely subjective though. And I understand why a lot of people seem to think he hasn't. and I understand why a lot of people seem convinced he has. Either way dude's a dumbass and clearly struggles with taking responsibility for his actions and given all of the awful shit he did back then that's definitely something he needs to learn right about now.

sorry I just like rambled a novella in your comment. I'm not sure why I let this get so long just to conclude with ""ya you right tho"" but it's too late now"

2527,2020-07-23 02:43:36,hw6iaf,I agree with everything you're saying. The excuses need to stop. He is racist and a creep/pedophile. I stand by that.

anyway back to the subject at hand since I'm already commenting: ik I wasn't the one being asked, but I absolutely have met many people in real life who make the same kind of unnecessarily dark joke that Shane used to make, ESPECIALLY back when he used to make them. 
Not saying it makes it okay, mind you. Just because I know people who have driven drunk doesn't mean I think it's an okay thing to do.
But you asked if she had ever known people irl who make those jokes and the answer is absolutely yes ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

2570,2020-07-12 20:29:38,hpzorf,the oldest son isnt famous though
2571,2020-07-12 21:48:21,hpzorf,yes they seem to be just about the smartest kids alive
2572,2020-07-12 20:30:33,hpzorf,yes hes been letting a young r&b man sleep with his wife and the kids know about it
2573,2020-07-12 20:48:38,hpzorf,who is tom cruise's cuck
2574,2020-07-12 21:04:47,hpzorf,who????????

2576,2020-07-12 20:28:08,hpzorf,i mean how do you think they are embarassed by what he did
2577,2020-07-12 23:49:22,hpzorf,Except they're not children. All three of his children are adults

2579,2020-07-12 20:49:59,hpzorf,"It’s quite a well known fact that Tom Cruise is gay, he’s got a large compound outside of LA they call Boys Town."
2580,2020-07-12 20:31:08,hpzorf,"Yeah don’t invest my time in talking about children, especially children that have no relevance to my own life.  

I would reconsider how you phrase this question.  If you are asking specifically about how to approach this lifestyle when/if being a parent is a part of your non-kink life.  That may be an actual relevant conversation to have in this subreddit.

Otherwise, who cares!"
2581,2020-07-13 00:34:17,hpzorf,"Who cares, the question is open for us to speculate on a celebrity’s children and how **we** think **they** are handling it.  It’s a stupid question for this sub.

Asking something like, *”How would you approach this lifestyle once you have children who are old enough to understand something is different about your marriage?  How do you keep your kink life private as parents?  What would be some helpful advice on what to say if they ask about behaviors or actions they notice that are different?”*

That’s constructive conversation to have.  Discussing someone else’s children in the context of their parents sex life (whether they are adults or not) is disgusting & violating, even if these people are public figures."
2582,2020-07-12 20:48:26,hpzorf,so i dont know his name
2583,2020-07-12 21:04:24,hpzorf,how does one get in?
2584,2020-07-12 20:31:40,hpzorf,yes that is what i am talking about how do kids feel about their parents engaging in this

2590,2020-09-06 01:59:40,indm5z,"Disney's Pocahontas is an extremely romanticized and exaggerated version of the story. The original story was only from the perspective of the white dude (don't remember the name), as it was journaled by him. She did not become romantically attracted to said man. The entire Disney version is basically just an appropriation of the truth.

That said, being a Native American, her culture was certainly rooted in magick, though we have no information on whether or not she practiced any of it."
2591,2020-09-06 02:34:27,indm5z,It is fun but even so... the indigenous people already have their spiritual practices. So she is whatever they would consider her to be if they have terms for it.  She might align with modern craft but I wouldn't just call her something. Fictitious or not.

2599,2020-09-06 02:39:09,indm5z,"Hey, seriously no worries, love! It just might not be the right forum to talk about. But I do think it is fun to think about. The indigenous people are just a touchy subject in the craft. <3"
2600,2020-09-06 02:34:51,indm5z,What did I say wrong?
2601,2020-09-06 02:40:08,indm5z,"Oh I honestly did not realize that, thank you very much for the heads up."
2602,2020-09-06 02:39:19,indm5z,It was rather fetishizing and insensitive. I'm indigenous and there were generations of us that were prohibited from even practicing our own cultures by the us government. A lot of the current generation is cut off from the old ways due to genocidal violence. So having someone who is likely a descendant of settlers say they wish they could be part of one of our tribes just sounds wrong.
2603,2020-09-06 02:39:58,indm5z,"Just the very white, very colonialist romanticization of Native tribes as ~so connected to nature~ with no historical conception of Native Americans being made up of 100s of tribes all with unique cultures and relationships to the lands they lived on. You realize Natives are real people and not some dreamy fantasy you get to imagine living through?"
2604,2020-09-06 02:45:53,indm5z,Of course! Any questions I'm here or even to talk about your fun theory :D Its fun!
2605,2020-09-06 02:44:24,indm5z,"You're absolutely right and that was definitely not my intention. I'm sorry if I offended you. I honestly respect your people and your culture very much, and like to dream of being born into it and that settlers never existed. Please understand my intentions were good."
2606,2020-09-06 02:48:32,indm5z,"Yes of course. My intention was not to insult or offend anyone, but to express my fondness of the culture. I realize I made a mistake in conveying that and will be deleting this post. I'm just a peace loving hippie witch that wishes I could rewrite history."

2656,2020-09-01 07:57:20,ikfnvk,"By the way, all of these celebrities I listed were from Famous Birthdays.

[https://www.famousbirthdays.com/](https://www.famousbirthdays.com/)"
2657,2020-09-01 07:56:55,ikfnvk,"If 19 years:

Baby Boomers 1941-1959 (first to enter school after WWII ended to last being born in a United States with less than 50 states)

Gen X 1960-1978: First to be born in a United States like today to last graduating college in the 20th century

Millennials: 1979-1997: First to graduate college in the 21st century and the last to spend four years of college on campus

Gen Z: 1998-2016: First to graduate college remotely and the last to be born before Trump was president

Gen Alpha: 2017-present

If 18 years:

Baby Boomer: 1948-1965: The first to not have memories of more than half of the 1900s years and the last to graduate high school before Star Wars

Gen X: 1966-1983: First to enter high school after Star Wars and last to graduate high school before 9/11

Millennials: 1984-2001: First to graduate high school after 9/11 and the last to experience a traditional high school graduation

Gen Z: 2002-2019: First to graduate high school remotely and last to be born before a worldwide pandemic"

Gen Y: 1980-1998 (first 80s borns to last who can possibly remember 9/11)

Gen Z: 1999-2017 (first who can't possibly remember 9/11 to last who can possibly remember pre-COVID 19 world)"
2661,2020-09-01 17:28:39,ikfnvk,"True. Even though I wouldn't argue for this organization of generations, I still liked reading one possible interpretation of how certain years could be grouped together."
2662,2020-09-02 00:03:49,ikfnvk,"I know that, but I actually like this generational grouping. Makes all generations 18-19 years is very balanced, compared to making it very short as 15-16 or less years or making it very long like 21-22+ years. It makes things easier for everyone else instead of all this confusion. But at the same time, this is all arbitrary. I know that we are not really millennials at the end of the day, especially based on how society views millennials and such, but maybe being a millennial is different to another person. Just my two cents."
2663,2020-09-01 07:59:34,ikfnvk,Interesting.
2664,2020-09-10 23:10:09,ikfnvk,What's wrong with that? I was just listing a bunch of celebrities born around that time.
2665,2020-09-01 07:43:39,ikfnvk,"I dont think ""first who cant possibly remember"" or ""last who can possibly remember"" something are good markers to mark a generation. I mean it is very likely a three or four year old would not remember the political importance of these events. They may not even know who this Kennedy is until like years after he died. 1961 might have memories prior to Kennedy's death.  I am sure many 1959 and 1960 borns would not remember Kennedy's death. Many 1995-1998 dont even remember 9/11. 2015-2017 though can end up remembering a world before coronavirus 15 years from now, even though they may not know what coronavirus is.

2666,2020-09-01 07:52:21,ikfnvk,"Not bad. It's just shifted over four years earlier.

Instead of this:
Boomer: 1946-1964
Gen X: 1965-1983
Gen Y: 1984-2002
Gen Z: 2003-2021

It's this:

Gen Z: 1999-2017"
2667,2020-09-01 07:58:57,ikfnvk,"The 1961-1979 and 1980-1998 definitions aren't that uncommon actually. Many people want to begin gen y at 1980 since it's the first 80s year, so whenever they also apply the 18 year span, it ends up being 1980-1998. You barely ever see 1942-1960 and 1999-2017 though."
2668,2020-09-01 08:09:10,ikfnvk,"I prefer the ranges next to: instead of this rather than its this. Makes no sense for 1960 to be gatekept from the other two early 60s years. You even said 1980 should be start of millennials since it is the first 80s year. First half of the 60s is gen jones anyways. 

I have seen 1945-1959 as a baby boomer definition. 

Then 1960-1979. 

1980-1999 is one of the most agreeable millennial definitions I have come across. It is my favorite actually. 

I am not keen on when Gen Z ends though.

2669,2020-09-01 08:02:57,ikfnvk,"1961-1979 is uncommon. I have seen 1960-1979 though with 1946-1959, and even 1960-1980. 1961-1982 is used by just one source though and that uses 1943-1960. I have seen 1998-2016. Never 1999-2017 though. People would prefer stating X in 1960 if 1964 or 1965 is too late, since the first three years of the 60s are the full early 60s years, just like how you said 1980 should be y as it is the first 80s year. People prefer 1982 over 1980 as the millennial start date though."
2670,2020-09-01 08:01:55,ikfnvk,"First of all, I have never seen 1961-1979 and I seen 1942-1960, with the exception of 1942, so 1943-1960. I have seen 1980-1998 (though I feel that most start Y in 1980 cause it is the first 80s year like ending it in 1994 or 1999 for the same numerical reason. I have seen 1999-2017 in a way, maybe excluding 2017, so 1999-2016."

2674,2020-08-30 01:05:34,ij3y4d,Excellent. Enjoy reading about less well known treks!
2675,2020-10-08 21:30:12,ij3y4d,"Hey! Thanks for posting this. So few people have done this route, so any information is highly valuable. I actually just did the little shorty bit that you skipped in the Chiricahuas. I’m going to paste below to fill in that missing spot in your report ☺️ 


On October 6th, my friend Larry Bird started a counter-clockwise attempt of the Sky Island Traverse. I planned to join her for the first stretch of it through the Chiricahuas and Dos Cabezas. I’ve hiked the Pacific Crest Trail, but have never done a route before. Larry Bird has done two other Brett Tucker routes, so I felt comfortable joining along under her hiker-trash-hardened wing. Ultimately I ended my stretch early because the double whammy concern about fall-time water availability in the Northern Chiricahuas compounded with the slow-motion bushwacks through the area just felt too risky for me, but Larry Bird continued on. Here’s my account of the little bit that I did: 

Silver peak to Pinnacle Rock (Mile 520- 508.3)
Woke up early at the trailhead. Since we arrived after dark the previous night, the view of the rock walls in the early morning light was such a surprise! I’ve heard somewhere that Cave Creek Canyon is sometimes called “the Yosemite of Arizona”. The trail to Silver Peak is highly trafficked during bird watching season in the spring. Me and Larry Bird signed our names in the register. It was so beautiful up there. Looking Southwest you can see Chiricahua Peak (You’ll be up there tomorrow!) and the surprisingly green valley floor of Cave Creek. After descending the peak, we had a bit of a pleasant road walk under the many trees that line Cave Creek road. The first few miles of South Fork Trail #243 were excellent, with many pools of water still left in the creek after a long, dry summer.  After a few miles, the trail leaves the creek (mile 509.7). We turned up a drainage to follow the route. Seeing how dry this drainage was, we turned back to gather water from South Fork Creek, assuming we wouldn’t see any water until Juniper Spring (six miles away at mile 503.7). We gathered 3 liters each and planned to dry camp. The trail deteriorated pretty quickly after the split and required a lot of time-consuming bushwhacking and rock hopping. Larry Bird pointed out tons of bear scat along this drainage. The sun set quickly in the shady canyon, so we found a little flat spot shortly after Pinnacle Rock and set up our cowboy camp. We decided to hang our food because of all the bear scat, but a bear came to visit in the night anyway (and a bold skunk too!). 

Pinnacle Rock to Rustler Park Campground (mile 508.3-497.2)
Didn’t sleep much after our bear encounter last night, so we slept in a little later than planned. These fall days are getting shorter, not many hiking hours! Hit the trail by 7. Feeling a little frustrated by the slow hiking yesterday evening, we checked the map and saw that South Fork “Trail” #243 joined the Crest Trail at mile 506.6 The Crest Trail is a maintained trail and it seemed like a light at the end of the tunnel. The junction was 1.7 miles away, and we figured we’d probably take a bit longer with the bushwhacking and rock hopping—maybe like 2 hours. Oh how wrong we were! The drainage quickly steepened and became increasingly more and more jammed with deadfall. Looking back on Cave Creek Canyon near the top of the climb was really amazing, especially with the bright yellow patches of fall-time Aspens. By the time we got to the junction after the absolutely maniacal ascent it was already noon. Five hours for a little under two miles! The Crest Trail was such a sight for sore eyes. Beautiful views and gently ambling over the rolling hillsides. Running low on water, we booked the next four miles to Juniper Spring. Juniper Spring had a little pool that was easy to collect from. Eagle Spring right after was easy to collect from too, but had lots of algae. Really primo views from the top of Chiricahua Peak! We stopped at Anita Spring (really clear, cool water). Anita Park has an eery vibe because of the fires and all of the dead standing trees. We coasted the rest of the way to Rustler Park Campground, where I have Larry Bird a big old hug and wished her luck for the stretch ahead. 

Notes to self:

-Bring pants for those bushwacks!

-Bushwacking changes the game! There are no rules! 1.7 miles could take 5 hours. If you’re using the standard 3 mph pace to plan food and water, you’re gonna be way off. 

-Anticipate the bushwacks through this section by checking trail conditions at http://www.chiricahuatrails.com. We relied a little too heavily on Brett’s SKIT write up, although his report was 10 years old and a lot has changed (wildfire, flash flood) the landscape of the Chiricahuas since then. I regret not researching the conditions of South Fork Trail #243. If we’d known how rough and slow-going it would be, we would’ve packed a lot more water from the previous source. 

-Don’t cook at camp if you pass one million piles of bear scat in an area lol

-The Chiricahuas are insanely beautiful and truly magical!!"
2676,2020-08-30 05:13:49,ij3y4d,"the Sky Islands are unique which makes all the trail/route finding worth it. I did bretts GET and would enjoy the challenge of the SkIT. I'm a little envious of brett that he has been able to romp around in these places.  

Kudos for you as this is your first LD hike and you went solo. Nice. 

The trail write ups describing their recent Mar state are priceless."
2677,2020-08-30 20:18:56,ij3y4d,Excellent write up and quite a walk.  It is one on my radar screen.  Thanks.
2678,2020-09-28 04:24:26,ij3y4d,Excellent resource for future hikers!  Thanks for sharing.
2679,2020-08-30 06:04:09,ij3y4d,"Woah, nice! I remember! Definitely agree on getting back to Santa Teresas some time (and Santa Catalinas and Chiricahuas). I look back fondly on the rough parts and would gladly do more, but unfortunately it was too easy to take the bypasses when they were all planned and mapped out 😛."
2680,2020-10-09 02:04:09,ij3y4d,"Thanks for filling in that blank for me! Yeah, it blows my mind that folks like Dirtmonger could average 25 mpd on this trail. I had the same problem with underestimating how long it would take. It's possible to rack up big miles on the AZT sections, but off the AZT it's difficult to predict what you'll experience."
2681,2020-08-29 00:22:13,iiiezr,"hey! 16m from canada, you seem pretty cool! im into politics and don't mind a few of the artists you mentioned, hmu if you want!"

TOP 100 FOR MR. MEATY BEEFCASTLE HIMSELF!"
2685,2020-08-28 05:35:01,ii13wz,"there's always one extremely ridiculous pick on the PWI and i'd like to nominate 2020's as Danhausen being above like three different teams that held tag titles lmao

edit: wait no lmao holy shit Warhorse is above Goto"
2686,2020-08-28 05:38:16,ii13wz,"I don’t understand how you rate Shinsuke Nakamura above Adam Page if you’re going off achievement, in or out of kayfabe"
2687,2020-08-28 06:00:04,ii13wz,DAD! 500 DAD!
2688,2020-08-28 06:05:29,ii13wz,"I like finding new indie wrestlers from the latter half of these lists.

Still Life With Apricots and Pears is pretty awesome. Really mastered this creepy otherness with his movements. Reminds me of Voldo and early Goldust. Discomforting."
2689,2020-08-28 06:06:35,ii13wz,EVIL is at least a hundred spots lower than he would be if these rankings went a month later
2690,2020-08-28 07:30:01,ii13wz,"Breeze at 483?! What? Lol

Also beat friends are criminally low."
2691,2020-08-28 08:15:41,ii13wz,"Best part of the list is how the always give up after the first 25 or so spots and jist start throwing random names around, trying to space out the WWE wrestlers so they don't fill the list, and continuously ignoring CMLL & AAA."
2692,2020-08-28 06:30:44,ii13wz,"I get that the bottom 100 or so might as well be done with a dartboard, but Peter Avalon being so high on that list at 443 is kinda baffling, even in kayfabe.

Would have liked to seen Brandon Cutler at 500."
2693,2020-08-28 05:22:44,ii13wz,Otis at 69...nice
2694,2020-08-28 11:32:35,ii13wz,"I love the fact that for some reason Pentagon had a better year than Nick Jackson, but not Matt Jackson."
2695,2020-08-28 05:42:51,ii13wz,Jado and Gedo being above Mochizuki and like 200 people is... interesting
2696,2020-08-28 09:23:49,ii13wz,"The PWI requirements are strange. How does Lesnar even rank with the necessary 20 match minimum over that time period? I'm not sure if he's wrestled 20 matches since 2015, lol.."
2697,2020-08-28 05:30:11,ii13wz,Sonny Kiss up almost 200 spots from last year! Murphy down 81 spots to 114 which seems a little outrageous to me
2698,2020-08-28 05:30:43,ii13wz,No Question Mark?
2699,2020-08-28 05:15:23,ii13wz,Tuff Stuff Ricky South at 495! Hell yeah.
2700,2020-08-28 05:39:34,ii13wz,"I am so fucking stoked for Nick Gage to get so high, and I think you could argue he is still too low. He held the belt of the most popular indie for years, and was a major attraction wherever he showed up."
2701,2020-08-28 06:05:02,ii13wz,"Anyone know what #29 is? Brodie Lee is mysteriously absent from this list, so was wondering if he was maybe that number?"
2702,2020-08-28 06:11:18,ii13wz,"There should be some honor for 500th, like the Mr. Irrelevant of the NFL Draft"
2703,2020-08-28 06:19:56,ii13wz,Holy shit Masato Tanaka still wrestles?!?! Also super happy to see a lot of AA wrestlers on the list. Specially my guy Darius Lockhart. He can truly be an asset to any of the major companies cards. Man is CRAZY talented. Also that boi Chris Bey. He’s got an insanely bright future.
2704,2020-08-28 06:45:56,ii13wz,"R-Truth won something like 30 titles this year. He should clearly be #1!

2707,2020-08-28 05:55:18,ii13wz,Marko Stunt over The Usos LOLMFAO
2708,2020-08-28 05:30:09,ii13wz,Hey kento is top 25 that's cool
2709,2020-08-28 06:26:50,ii13wz,Bushi above Suzuki ????? What?
2710,2020-08-28 15:12:42,ii13wz,"Let me be the millionth one to say: This list makes no freaking sense. 

How can Zack Ryder be ranked ahead of a guy that's on Raw every single week?

Kayfabe or not, isn't being on Raw better than not being on Raw?"
2711,2020-08-28 16:24:41,ii13wz,Where is The Undertaker? He won  35 minute gauntlet match with his hat still on to win the prestigious Tuwaiq Mountain Trophy!
2712,2020-08-28 06:53:53,ii13wz,"Kofi is way too high. Sure he was WWE champ for two months out of the last year but since then he’s only been a tag wrestler. And you can’t say they value his tag run because his partner Big E didn’t even make the top 100.

Then again nothing about this list really makes sense. It’s just a bit of a fun random list that isn’t meant to be taken seriously at all. If it was in ring based guys like Shingo, ELP, Ishii, Murphy, Ryu Lee, Gargano,etc would be higher. If it was keyfabe there’s no way Gulak is at 60 and guys like Bray, Roman, Hangman, Omega and Brock are under Kofi the last 12 months."
2713,2020-08-28 06:00:08,ii13wz,Mikey Nicholls being ahead of Shane Thorne makes me laugh since Thorne is the HBK of TM61 LOL
2714,2020-08-28 06:03:29,ii13wz,"Unless I missed it (entirely possible, lotta names, so please correct me if I did), no Joey Ryan or David Starr.

I had wondered how they’d handle that on another thread.

Anyone know what they were rated last year? I assume they were."
2715,2020-08-28 06:31:34,ii13wz,"Chad Gable is ranked right under Fish & O’Reilly, and that got me thinking that if Undisputed Era ever breaks up I want those three to form a new group."
2716,2020-08-28 07:34:05,ii13wz,I'm surprised Orton is not higher on the list
2717,2020-08-28 15:25:40,ii13wz,Mark my words. I’ll be on this list
2718,2020-08-28 12:18:00,ii13wz,I must be #501 again. 9 years running now. ;)
2719,2020-08-28 11:01:18,ii13wz,Congrats to PCO for making 31 at 52 years old!
2720,2020-08-28 11:27:56,ii13wz,It’s true what they say - look at the top few then go straight to 500...
2721,2020-08-28 13:45:38,ii13wz,How did John Silver make the list? He's a fucking idiot
2722,2020-08-28 15:59:42,ii13wz,Bray Wyatt being not in top 10 makes no sense.
2723,2020-08-28 05:16:17,ii13wz,I'm pretty sure you can pay to have your name on this list.
2724,2020-08-28 07:08:24,ii13wz,"MOLLY!! GET IN THERE!!

&#x200B;

Also, Ashley Vox, Ashley's sister & Ashley's girlfriend being within 10 picks of each other is pretty nice.

&#x200B;

And this is more confirmation that Kylie Rae is the Queen of Intergender Wrestling, bar none. And seeing her above Riddle, Scurll & Dream did put a smile on my face."
2725,2020-08-28 05:15:51,ii13wz,Mansoor is 333!? He hasn’t lost since May 2019! He’s defeated Cesaro and Dolph Ziggler! Top 50 easily.
2726,2020-08-28 05:57:22,ii13wz,Chris Hero at 345 is a TRAVESTY!!

MARKO FUCKING STUNT GOT A HIGHER RATING THEN THE USOSSSSS

*faints*"
2728,2020-08-28 13:13:01,ii13wz,"I love this list every year I don't care what anyone says. What I also love is because there's so much wrestling out there, I know so much more people then I did back in the day. It's a great way to get little write ups on talent."
2729,2020-08-28 13:48:04,ii13wz,Another year another list another robbery of Psycho Mike being #1 on the list.
2730,2020-08-28 14:13:55,ii13wz,I am just happy Kylie rae(78) is in top 100
2731,2020-08-28 14:24:22,ii13wz,Why are the best friends rated lower than so many other tag teams in aew?
2732,2020-08-28 15:08:35,ii13wz,"Anyone know what the biggest jump is this year?

I know RSP was unranked in 2019 and is 235 this year."
2733,2020-08-28 15:19:47,ii13wz,"Lee Johnson at 487 is interesting.

Preston Vance at 461 above Breeze, Tozowa, Marshall is weird.

If someone can explain to me how Shawn Dean made it to 319, i'd very much appreciate it.

Edit : Will hobbs at 263.. i'm done... there's no way these AEW Dark guys should be listed this high."
2734,2020-08-28 15:25:06,ii13wz,"by and large the list makes sense to me, but the more closely I look at it the more bizarre it is. feel the same way every year."

In kayfabe, no fucking way should Lesnar be over Omega"

good for him doing well in the family business. Where has he been wrestling?"
2738,2020-08-28 22:48:08,ii13wz,Yuji Nagata at 476? I mean I don't expect him to be in the top 10 but he should at least be a couple hundred places higher than the bottom 25!
2739,2020-08-29 14:00:56,ii13wz,Kofi at 9? How? He’s a great wrestler but in Kayfabe he got destroyed by lesnar and got beat so bad he went back to the tag division
2740,2020-08-28 08:35:40,ii13wz,"‘Who the hells that?’ Me thought this list. 

Didn’t realise how many people I don’t know lol. 

Also am I missing something with the criteria, there’s not many women at all. There are so many I can think of that deserve to be on this list mixed in with the talent"

2761,2020-08-29 16:00:34,ii13wz,"I have to say that I grew up watching WWF/WWE. I lost interest somewhere in the mid 2,000s. I've been watching AEW since it's debut on TNT and have watched every episode (minus the YouTube stuff). If this list tells me anything it just how far the WWE has fallen. I turned Smackdown on last night and watched 4 woman stand there and show just how terrible they were with a mic in their hands. The acting was atrocious and the wrestling just as bad."

2769,2020-08-28 16:59:10,ii13wz,"Chris Vice is not on the list at all? He was Double Champion in Zero1 for a while. Kind of surprising.

Woahhhhhh mindfuck

Kylie is the best all around regardless of gender now? So Asuka or Io don't have that distinction of being the best ""regardless of gender""

2796,2020-08-28 12:33:44,ii13wz,How the fuck is Bayley not the highest ranked woman considering she’s been extremely dominant this entire judging period and has been champion all but 5 days and worked an insane amount of matches? She’s not even on here at all. How is Titus O’Neil above Tyler Breeze when he doesn’t wrestle? I don’t understand how this works.
2797,2020-08-28 05:17:21,ii13wz,"I guess it’s one thing to include women and another to rank them equivalently.

Edit: apparently those ranked on this list are ones that do intergender matches. So that makes more sense. But also, I disagree with that being a condition."

2803,2020-08-28 10:04:21,ii13wz,Being MLW National Openweight Champion for as long as he's been and being in last year's N-1 Victory (and beating freaking Marufuji of all people) is enough for him being in the top 100.

I remember when they put one of CMLL top stars, Volador Jr, who had the 3rd best W/L record in the company that year, won multiple titles and tournaments and Main Evented their biggest show of the year at 414 just a few spots above Curt Hawkins lol

But watching Ultimo Guerrero at 50 and Niebla Roja at 139 was surprising, I expected no CMLL guy to make it past 250 because this was genuinely one of the worst calendar years in the company's history"

2019-2020: Wrestled in seven different calendar months.

2018-2019: Only wrestled in five months, despite being Universal Champion for most of the period.

2017-2018: Wrestled in seven different calendar months.

2016-2017: Wrestled in eight different calendar months.

2015-2016: Wrestled in eight different calendar months.

2014-2015: Only wrestled four matches (in Aug, Sep, Jan, and Mar), even though he was WWE Champion from August to March.

2013-2014: Only wrestled three times (SummerSlam, Rumble, Mania)

2012-2013: Only wrestled three times (SummerSlam, Mania, Extreme Rules)"

2832,2020-08-28 19:43:53,ii13wz,It also lists Erik and Rowan as two separate people.
2833,2020-08-28 06:28:59,ii13wz,Masato Tanaka was the DDT KO-D Openweight Champion (which is the top belt in DDT) for the majority of this year actually (won it at the end of January and lost it in June).

2835,2020-08-28 10:01:59,ii13wz,DANGAN never missed a beat and his 6 month-ish KO-D Openweight Championship reign is evidence of it.

I guess PWI investigated like WWE and considers sex crimes against teenagers to be okay. I mean she was age of consent in the Scurll case, so of course creepy males who know the age of consent off by heart would believe him.

2866,2020-08-28 09:06:15,ii13wz,He was injured  for most of the time frame I'm sure he'll be top 10 next year if he keeps the run he's in.

2871,2020-09-02 01:08:22,ii13wz,Probably cuz he didn't wrestle very much on TV.

2874,2020-08-28 05:38:57,ii13wz,It's all women who compete with men.
2875,2020-08-28 06:31:14,ii13wz,They include women who do intergender matches on the main PWI list. That means none of the women from WWE and AEW are on the list.
2876,2020-08-28 06:48:06,ii13wz,This is only got women who compete against men as well as women. Or just men.
2877,2020-08-29 05:46:10,ii13wz,Moxley’s undefeated in AEW aside from a tag match he walked out of and one where he got beat up by several different guys before he could start it so his partner had to go 1 on 2. He’s 22-0-1 in singles matches. He also won and defended the US title in New Japan. That’s a pretty strong resume.
2878,2020-08-28 10:00:16,ii13wz,"That's why there is the PWI Female 100. The women on the PWI 500 list are those who were on intergender matches and afaik only a very very restrict list of joshi wrestlers (*cough* Saki Akai *cough*) can be considered in the list. However if this was a list of the 500 overall wrestlers regardless of gender (and yes, male, female and everything in between), you can bet your last euro that they would be there."
2879,2020-08-28 08:42:23,ii13wz,"It's not just this list, it's most wrestling fans in the world."

There is another list that comes out in a month or so that is the PWI 100 for the women. She'll be on that one."

It's why there is no Bayley, Becky, Charlotte, Asuka, Sasha etc.."
2882,2020-08-28 05:34:54,ii13wz,Women also have their own list. PWI with women is..... wierd. It's trying to be inclusive without drowning out the swath of midcarders that'd normally get a theoretical bump.
2883,2020-08-28 05:40:06,ii13wz,"I'm curious, when ranking the women on this list, do they only count the intergender matches or all of their matches as a whole?"
2884,2020-08-28 16:31:48,ii13wz,"The only woman on the list are ones that have been in intergender matches during the timeframe, I think they said"
2885,2020-08-28 08:40:19,ii13wz,They are on the women's list. Because they are women who don't wrestle men.
2886,2020-08-28 16:55:43,ii13wz,He beat Shiozaki too. I think he is too low.

I think Page’s 9 successful tag title defenses is a lot more impressive in kayfabe than two disappointing title reigns. Especially when Page dominated and made the pinfalls in most of those matches.

On that note what has Kenny done to deserve 13 that Page hasn’t?

Edit: clarity"
2894,2020-08-28 12:45:29,ii13wz,There’s no kayfabe explanation for that lol

2900,2020-08-28 06:05:50,ii13wz,Right doesn't this go all the way back to mid 2019 aswell? He was doing squash matches to critically acclaimed matches with Aleister Black to Tag Team Champion all in about three months time
2901,2020-08-28 11:34:33,ii13wz,"But he usually loses all the time, apart from a brief run as Tag champ."

2906,2020-08-28 23:29:28,ii13wz,I think Erik is Erik of the Viking Raiders and rowan is Erik Rowan.

2922,2020-08-28 05:58:24,ii13wz,I think they got rid of the women's list and are now including them in the top 500

2927,2020-08-28 08:42:27,ii13wz,"If they're only counting his AEW career, then he's only been a tag champ."
2928,2020-08-28 14:08:00,ii13wz,I’m a big Nakamura fan and I don’t even remember his other title defenses besides Strowman.
2929,2020-08-28 09:25:36,ii13wz,"I think there's less merit in dominating the tag division when we're judging individual work. In that sense, I'll always give the benefit to those that have won singles titles. Also, Kenny has been AAA's champion for like 9 months so that definitely puts him above Page."
2930,2020-08-28 14:47:03,ii13wz,Definitely. I remember previous years where WWE jobbers with little to no wins would have high rankings in the early 100s over indie guys who actually were doing well.
2931,2020-08-28 12:48:20,ii13wz,Nice

2935,2020-08-28 16:41:42,ii13wz,"No, I was making a comment not an argument.

If I wanted an argument I'd argue the leaker of this list was scum for releasing this list early thus depriving businesses of much needed revenue in this time of covid because all us shitheads aren't going to buy PWI500 issue now we know it's key selling point. Aren't we a bunch of entitled assholes?"
2936,2020-08-28 11:00:58,ii13wz,"They will, but just not now. Also, they need to tone down their US bias."

2939,2020-08-28 12:43:53,ii13wz,"They seemed to dock Tessa for the bullying/racism allegations and leaving Impact and being inactive.

In kayfabe Kylie holds 3 different champions that are ""men's titles"" while Tessa lost her indie ones."
2940,2020-08-28 10:05:30,ii13wz,Kylie did more intergender matches even though Tessa having won the Impact World Championship.
2941,2020-08-28 06:22:55,ii13wz,"I have zero idea. I asked this in another thread myself. 

To me, it should just be their intergender matches then have only the other matches count towards the other list. But, who knows. 

 This is the first year they've done this I think. They've had women on they list before but that was before they had a separate list for the women."
2942,2020-08-28 06:58:05,ii13wz,I think they said that eventually they might but I would guess that's a ways away.

2944,2020-08-28 16:27:21,ii13wz,"Their time period is usually Sept- aug and I think it was it in Oct last year, so no, they haven't. Should be within the next couple of months I think."
2945,2020-08-28 10:07:01,ii13wz,"It will be a progressive change but right now, only those with intergender credentials."
2946,2020-08-28 08:45:54,ii13wz,"Right, but the tag titles are pretty important in AEW."
2947,2020-08-28 10:05:12,ii13wz,"This is the criteria that PWI use for the rankings, according to wikipedia: “They follow a criterion that includes win-loss record, championships won, quality of competition, major feuds, prominence within a wrestler's individual promotion(s) and overall wrestling ability.”

Let’s go bet for beat though those criteria…

Win Loss Record: Page is 15-3, currently 1-0 in singles and 13-0 in tag

Championships Won: One half of the tag team champions

Quality of Competition: AEW’s tag team division is one of the most stacked in history, a veritable murderer’s row

Major fueds: Involved in one of AEW’s longest running storylines between himself, Kenny Omega and The Young Bucks.

Prominence within a wrestler’s promotion: He is featured ever single week, practically without fail. Wave 2 of the action figure line, prominent in all advertising, undoubtably AEW’s blue chipper and they’re proud of it.

Overall wrestling ability: He’s one of the best in AEW and slowly becoming one of the best in North America

So yeah…he’s above fucking Shinsuke, I’m sorry. Having a lousy run with the IC title doesn’t put him about Hangman, in my book at least. And honestly by those metrics I don’t know how he isn’t in the top 10."
2948,2020-08-28 20:44:14,ii13wz,Nice
2949,2020-08-28 21:43:33,ii13wz,That does explain it. Thank you for the follow-up!
2950,2020-08-28 10:24:38,ii13wz,"Kylie did them on the indie scene. Tessa did them on international TV. She was the face of an entire major promotion and won their men's world title. If the list takes Kayfabe into account, then you can't put any woman above Tessa."
2951,2020-08-28 09:23:18,ii13wz,I don't thing tag titles would mean that much when it's only ranking them as single wrestlers and not tag teams

You can put each in separate ability bar slots and do them together, so 28/14 ticks (really more like 16 ticks as it takes 1 or 2 to recognize it). This is much less effort/player exclusive than skeletons due to lack of competition.


Woodcutting can be done on divine locations. You can do this on an ironman or nonironman easily in the lvl 95 resource dungeon or do divine yews at reset on w48 or at 18 game time on w140. 


This is better for some of the woodcutting tasks than their opposition."

2986,2020-10-01 21:15:14,j3dsku,"Dwarven tools set to double resources work, using dwarven chain-axe on a divine yew really speeds things up."
2987,2020-10-02 08:53:25,j3dsku,I am glad Task 48 has Prayer as Option B. But Option A seems ridiculous. 30 Slayer tasks is going to take anywhere between 5-8 hours. No idea why it had to be that high.
2988,2020-10-01 20:02:31,j3dsku,"So a couple things.

For all but the highest fishing task you can usually do Menaphos. If desert soles, catfish, or beltfish are an option you should use Menaphos every time because the fishing rate is MUCH quicker there if you have gotten the rep boosts and can use the VIP district.

The same is true for Woodcutting if you have Acadia logs you should ALWAYS be doing these tasks in Menaphos without question.

For farming tasks you don't even need to do runs. Grab some seeds, optional: grab some type of compost, and buy a few instant grow potions from the PoF farmer's market for 1-2K beans. Find a patch, plant the seeds, add the compost if you have it, and then pour the potion. No need to  do multiple runs or patches or wait in any capacity. You just harvest, rinse and repeat. I know you mentioned this for the later tasks but it works for the early ones to.

Smelting and Thieving can be much quicker/costless  with the right tools and options. If you're a high enough thief level then just do all the Prifddinas thieving it's super profitable and very quick. If you're not high enough to do Priff then equip the sticky fingers relic from archeology and go do what you can so long as it's not gnomes. For Smelting if you have super heat it reduces ore smelting by 1 game tick which is 6 seconds, that adds up fast turns these into about a 45 minute task."
2989,2020-10-02 11:15:14,j3dsku,Arch is fast if you have thr artefacts for it. Can also use dwarven chainaxe.

2992,2020-10-01 23:37:13,j3dsku,"Acadias are actually on a lower level than yew trees, only the first 2 tasks can be done with them.

I didn't mention the instagrowth potions because it's not needed at all. Anyone who has ever trained farming has done herb runs and has something growing. 1-2 patches is enough, so no need to throw 2k beans away for it.

Priff thieving isn't as quick as the other tasks. It's afk, but not faster than 30-45 minutes of archaeology at the 119 spot for task 27, 450 black d'hide boots (barely 1m loss atm) on task 30 or 7 hard clues on task 42. 

I forgot about superheat form and menaphos fishing though, will add those."
2993,2020-10-01 19:21:33,j3dsku,I thought nobody played GOP? I've been waiting for spotlight to rotate
2994,2020-10-02 00:41:20,j3dsku,"It depends as well on your level, I've had what resources I can do change on me mid task as I level up. Acadias can be used for most WCing tasks if you are low enough.

You say that but I know plenty, myself included that don't do farm runs and don't just have a stock of herbs growing. If you're going to make a guide to help people you need to think beyond yourself and consider as many types of players as possible, don't just assume. 

It's pure profit and while it's not as fast the fact it's AFK is huge for a lot of people because it's often not the time but the time + intensity of the activity that is the turn off."

Just beautiful stuff. A personal anecdote that will someday be on *my* Wiki article: the other day I went for an extended jog while listening to *Seconds Out* and as I finished the 9th mile, 'As Sure As Eggs Is Eggs' started and, maybe it was the exhaustion, the dehydration, the song itself, but it was the most hopeful I've felt all year. 'Now I'm baaack again--and babe it's gonna work out fiiinnne!'"
2999,2020-10-01 14:37:38,j37xum,"Well, I cheated and read this before lunch. Don’t tell my boss. Tremendous work, a suitably grand-scale epic for a grand-scale song. The Rashomon uncertainty about Apocalypse in 9/8’s origins somehow seems fitting for a sequence that is about the chaos of the world’s end, and it's cheering to discover that this was as much a game-changer for the band as it was for me personally. 

(And of course since you’ve listened to ARB, you know I wholly agree with your no. 1 pick.)"
3000,2020-10-01 13:01:30,j37xum,"Can't wait to read this in full.  Just skimmed and discovered that you found the quotes where they suggest that the recording of apocalypse in 9/8 was Phil's first take at the drums, not knowing the piece at all.  

Is that everyone else's read of this too?

Amazing, if so"

3002,2020-10-01 13:36:19,j37xum,"Well that was an awesome read. The way you interweave quotes so perfectly always amazes me, and the addition of the Bible verses was really cool. We have the same top 2; Supper’s Ready is the best way I can think of to spend 23 minutes, but there’s one more song above all else..."
3003,2020-10-01 18:40:59,j37xum,"I had just the slightest feeling that you'd put Firth of Fifth ahead of this one in the end. Which makes sense-- that song has almost as powerful of an ending section as this. I guess the bottom line is that both of your top two Genesis songs encapsulate everything Genesis is-- except Firth of Fifth does it more concisely and tightly (and, I'm assuming, unlike Supper's, you probably prefer the studio version over the live version).

oh and firth has the guitar solo too"
3004,2020-10-01 15:39:34,j37xum,"Went to the bathroom during math to read the whole thing, put on suppers ready to accompany me. Love this write up, probably my favorite Genesis song but I’d have to think about it. Top 3 for sure."
3005,2020-10-01 18:10:46,j37xum,"There was a Rock radio station in New Jersey back in the 80's, called Y107. They ended up changing formats, however just prior to the change the DJ's could basically play any song they wanted. That's the one and only time I've heard Suppers Ready on the radio. I called and thanked the DJ at the end."
3006,2020-10-01 15:03:31,j37xum,"I was late for a visit for work earlier this week. Google Maps said it was 29 minutes away, but I arrived at the job site just as Supper's Ready was finishing. I thank Apocalypse and Eggs for getting me there in time."
3007,2020-10-01 22:25:04,j37xum,Your analysis of As Sure As Eggs Is Eggs made me think of that line from Chamber of 32 Doors right before I got to where you reference that line. One bravo amongst many.
3008,2020-10-02 03:55:42,j37xum,Amazing write up. I’ve seen The Musical Box perform this several times. Apocalypse in 9/8 leaves you breathless and As Sure is Eggs is Eggs causes chills. Can’t imagine what it was like to see Genesis play this.
3009,2020-10-03 00:21:26,j37xum,"Just got round to reading this. Wonderful as always. One of my favourite moments which you didn't mention was that reprise of the ""fireman who looks after the fire"" theme with a trombone?-like sound just before Apocalypse kicks in. It's such a complex multi layered song with so much to love."
3010,2020-10-01 16:08:21,j37xum,"What a great read this was.  Even with having heard this song about a billion times, I genuinely picked up on new things in the song that I hadn't thought about before.

> I must admit, for as good as the studio track is, whenever I want to listen to “Supper’s Ready” I find myself almost exclusively choosing the *Seconds Out* version.

Right there with you.  Just for one thing, the climax after ""Apocalypse in 9/8"" (when the dam finally bursts) is so much more of a *climax* in this version thanks to a change in the percussion arrangement.  It's so damn good."
3011,2020-10-01 17:21:12,j37xum,"Great write up to a great tune. I find it hard to pick a favourite and although I'm not sure Supper's Ready is it, I continually find it interesting and fresh to listen to because it's so diverse musically and lyrically.

The live versions where the cheering starts up for Apocalypse in 9/8 and Banks's keyboard solo is both spine tingling and emotionally moving. Quite beautiful."
3012,2020-10-02 13:03:04,j37xum,"This is one of those pieces of music that people will still be talking about in 100 years. Honestly, this and other tracks like Close to The Edge and Tarkus, are less rock songs and closer to symphonic pieces played with rock instrumentation. 

I wish music academics were more open minded. Not only do they often completely ignore modern music like hip hop and edm (which is sad to me regardless of the lack of enjoyment I get personally from those genres) but they also gloss over these downright amazing 70s rock epics! It's completely crazy, theyre is just as rewarding for me to listen to as anything by those 18-20th century european composers."
3013,2020-10-03 14:22:08,j37xum,"2 things:

1.  The descriptions in italics... are they yours LordChozo, or do they come from some official band write-up?  I'd like to look at that official write-up if so!  Very cool, very helpful.

2.   The talk from the band and LordChozo of the band pioneering long songs...  close to the edge came out a month before this, thick as a brick about 6 months later.   It seems like they were part of a movement or moment here with a few other bands, doing long songs, rather than being sole pioneers of the long song.  No?"
3014,2020-10-05 00:12:47,j37xum,"I just finished reading this over the course of my very little free time the past few days, and wow, I was not expecting Supper's Ready to take home the silver! I find myself listening to Firth of Fifth more than Supper's Ready (and often preferring it myself), but I just assumed for the entirety of this project it would claim #1 by birthright. 

Regardless, though, I guess you could say that this song is alright. I'm sure I've listened to it once or twice. Would recommend."

3016,2020-10-01 16:06:17,j37xum,"The most beloved Genesis track, often sitting at the top of everyone's ratings of genesis songs. But not all share that opinion. For example, me! I like it, don't get the wrong idea, but I doubt it would even make my top 20, let alone #2. 

My biggest complaint is that it's a bunch of smaller songs stapled together and that the only reason the song is good is because all the individual bits just so happen to be good on their own and this particular placement just so happens to have a decent pace to it. It feels really unorganized and directionless. The song doesn't have any kind of unifying sound to it, so musically it all sounds different. Lyrically idk, there's the ""hello babe"" reprise at the end.

You have stuff like One for the Vine that stays pretty consistent throughout the whole thing - it always sounds like One for the Vine. The Duke Suite has those keys that help bring the song together and make it feel like it's one song(also all those reprises at the end help), sad that it wasn't released as one , but i hope you get the point. There are obviously different sections and each has its own sound, but they all belong, they feel at home. They all feel like a singular piece of music.

Also 12 string passages are boring, they work on Trespass though"

In those programs were these printed descriptions for each of the ""Supper's Ready"" movements. You can find another transcription of them [here](http://www.genesismuseum.com/programs1.htm), but I don't see an actual scan of the words themselves.

Regarding your second point, I don't think anyone is claiming that Genesis were unique in doing long songs here; when Phil says they were ""literally pushing the boundaries of what you could do on a record"" he did mean literally. He was referring to the time limitations on one side of a vinyl record. I think in general they were saying this was a big surge forward for them specifically, and not necessarily that they were inventing the side-long track in general."
3021,2020-10-03 14:41:15,j37xum,"I hear this criticism, but I tend to come at it more from the perspective seeing a long piece with constant similarities and refrains and choruses being done before and by others... that's not a challenge.  The challenge here is to put different pieces together and yet have them work as a whole.  And I think they did that spectacularly.  Yes, there are subtle reprises and allusions to previous bits... but not many and not often, like a close to the edge and thick as a brick etc. With their recurring choruses etc.  Genesis tried something more difficult here.  It's quite the feat.  My top favourite song."

Sampling similar-sounding paragraphs in novel-length erotica is also a piss-poor way to prove plagiarism: there are only so many ways to write wolf mating scenes that hit on all the tropes needed.  If it’s a paraphrase, chapter-length analysis or comparison of how the two novels partition themselves into chapters would be a stronger argument.

The whole drama surrounding the author is just musky, pearlescent f*ck sp*nk glazing the big alpha's throbbing, pheomone-soaked d*ck.

...Just made myself retch there for a second.

Anyway. As an outside observer this whole situation is and always has been hilarious. I live for fandom shenanigans like this. And all over freaking omegaverse fiction! Of all things!

The fact that she thinks she owns an entire genre that had been codified by 19-year-old fujoshis years before. Her lawyer and his absolute lack of point of reference to this nerdy, horny fiasco. Her comments! Her claims! It's all just (chef's kiss). As an unbiased third party, I love it. Call it schadenfreude if you want. I have no ill will towards anyone involved. It's just so ridiculous once you step away from it. I mean, if the Litigious Miss Cain has nothing else, she certainly has the audacity. Like, who *does* that?

Omegaverse isn't the weirdest genre I've ever stumbled across in all of years of reading fanfiction, but of the ones I read, maybe one or two actually didn't come off pretty problematic and or pull a ""(Alpha) is doing [insert very red flag/toxic/abusive action here] to (Omega), isn't that so hot/sweet/romantic?"" kind of thing. It really bothered me, especially when I would peek at the comments and see just about everyone in them saying how it's ""so cute"" and not seeing any issue or concern that, in the case of the last omegaverse fic I read's ending, the alpha was isolating the omega after they (omega) gave birth to their child, completely 100% cutting them off from their close friends and family members so that the alpha is the *only* person in their life."

Earliest i ever read one was 99 and it was for the Gundam Wing fandom, and a couple years after that, possibly 02-03  it was one based on Naruto. These were both on geocities sites, so both are long since gone. Both made me realize i did not like the premise, but the trope itself has existed for years. Possibly since Buffy."

She's also a lawyer (I think) as her day job and CLERKED FOR A SUPREME COURT JUDGE, and has repeatedly shown her willingness to go to the mat on this kind of thing.

When I go to kink specific writer forums you can always tell the newer authors by them talking about ""how crazy it is"" that another story put there had a similar plot/character to something they just wrote. And they will often half jokingly ""accuse"" others of having read their stories for inspiration.

Everyone likes to think their ideas are original. Everyone likes to think they were the first to put inspirational pieces of past works together into something new. It takes self awareness and maturity to admit most of the time thats never true."

3180,2020-09-23 16:45:17,iy0099,"I'm no psychologist but my assumption is that the real world is filled with violence and lack of consent and, to some people, some amount of romanticisation of the topics is cathartic."
3181,2020-09-23 17:56:01,iy0099,"It doesn't mean that they ""love violence and lack of consent"" explicitly, but a lot of people enjoy kinks like this because they're able look into such things in a safe way that allows them control over it.

3182,2020-09-23 05:24:55,iy0099,"Omegaverse fics have always baffled me for that reason. I can understand why someone who isn't into furries could just be attracted to the sub/dom aspect of the alpha/omega hierarchy, but then they go and slap great big wolf dicks on everyone. Why would you Frankenstein a dog dick onto a human when you could just make everyone a werewolf???"
3183,2020-09-23 03:28:29,iy0099,An alternate explanation is that Omegaverse fans are like bronies in that they technically should fall under the umbrella of being furries but the actual fandoms remain separate.  Perhaps the biggest difference is the amount of denial involved.

I will say that I am unsurprised that such a massive fandom would eventually get a/b/o stuff nonetheless.  Her co-writer make a joke or mentioned it on twitter to the best of my recollection. Also it's kinda a shitty move to use actual fanfic without the author's permission in a video that is critiquing or making fun of it. There was an author who I was following who had a section of her fic read by one of the actual VAs in a video just to make fun of the sex scene. It was super jarring too and not just because it was (at the time known creep but not yet canceled) Vic Mignogna but also the fic was about someone dying of terminal illness. It was pretty uncomfortable to watch even without that context.
3188,2020-09-23 12:56:13,iy0099,"The mpreg stuff is quite a popular kink. It certainly isn't exclusive to the Omegaverse. Hell, I'm pretty sure you'll find it in every fandom. There's a surprising amount of mpreg Transformers fanfiction/fanart, for example..."
3189,2020-09-23 07:42:19,iy0099,"Sort of? ""Omegas"" can get pregnant, but instead of the sex spectrum changing to A/B/O that I've stumbled across treat it like this: 

|| Male | Female 
:--: | :--: | :--:
Alpha | AM | AF
Beta | BM | BF
Omega | OM | OF

Most fandom A/B/O tends to be m/m so it's mostly ""men"" who get pregnant, but not specifically. ~~TBH I don't know why people in a world with A/B/O would have a strict gender binary and not a gender hexagony(?) But that's not my business~~

(I've never seen anything that deals with being intersex or trans in an A/B/O setting, so I can't comment on how those are handled if they even are.)

3192,2020-09-23 14:37:33,iy0099,Apparently her story was a Bane (from Dark Knight Rises) fanfic with the serial numbers filed off.
3193,2020-09-23 07:11:01,iy0099,"It's basically bodice rippers done in the style of Beauty and the Beast. It's pretty much an amalgamation of a handful of tried-and-true shipping tropes ramped up a few notches, flavored with/by the urban fantasy craze that went on around the time the genre really caught on. As a long-time fandomite I've always been facinated and somewhat off-put by A/B/O as a concept. I actually stumbled across Alison Kale's novel at an geek bookstore a few years ago and had a chuckle. I'd always strongly associated the kink with slash (gay) fandom pairings, so it was a bit of an anomaly to stumble across het omegaverse, let alone professionally published het omegaverse. If only I had known what I'd found. I woulda snatched it up in a heartbeat just for the joke of it all. 

IMHO I always catergorized ABO as one of those kinks that more or less forces a pseudo-het dynamic between the characters being shipped. It's kinda like the second coming of the whole seme/uke dynamic in slash (which has fallen out of favor in recent years as people become more 'woke' and conscious of their catergorization and fetishization of gay relationships) but with added kink shoved in. But hey. What do I know?"

You can kind of look at A/B/O as having two big potential ""functions"" 1) allowing homosexual pairings to participate in sex and reproduction similar to cisheterosexual couples and 2) cathartically explore exaggerated gender roles, often through the softening lens of fan pairings you enjoy. 

In both cases, the audacity of this woman to take something that's pretty queer in nature, try and claim she originated the hetero version (which arguably strips a lot of the subversion from the trope) and then sue other creators is mind boggling."

And it would avoid any hurt feelings, give proper credit, and avoid the shittier of Ellis' viewers from descending on unsuspecting fic writers and air dropping cruel comments. 

So, while I don't think it was a shitty thing to do or that she has any obligations, I would concede that it could be handled with more grace."

Personally, if I wrote fanfiction smut I wouldn't mind people making fun of it. Fanfiction is funny and smut is funny. sex is funny and ABO is funny. If one can read Paradise Lost and make fun of it without having to ask John Milton, I don't see why it would be ""shitty"" to make fun of any other piece of fanfic."

They're a lot more interested in the idea of humans having a pack dynamic than in the kinky wolf sex (although they're also into the kinky wolf sex) and a lot of what they've written is gen, exploring the ways that gender and class would complicate ""the pack.""

Said friend has totally broken my brain and I'm now like ""well, ABO isn't wholly illegitimate as a means of dissecting hierarchy"" even tho I know a lot of it (probably even most of it) is exactly what you think it is."
3239,2020-09-23 07:38:26,iy0099,"yeah it always seemed to me that the alpha-omega dynamic was an exaggerated rendition of male-female gender roles, and honestly I just don't see the point of that in het fic? Like, I get writing slash like this, it's a way to put these roles explicitly onto a same sex couple and while that's not my bag I can see why people would want to do that. But with het couples it's just... not much different than the traditional male-female dynamic from any old bodice-ripper."
3240,2020-09-23 14:01:17,iy0099,"honestly I’d say slashfic is alive and well. the way I always thought about m/m ABO is it’s a way to explore being a woman... without actually writing about being a woman, which is emotionally fraught. you can basically write whatever you want about the omega underclass... without the added pressure of it actually being sort of true. also if you’re writing smut, most of the time omega biology is slightly more relatable to a female reader than actual male biology."

3245,2020-09-23 17:03:37,iy0099,"I think the natural thing to want to do with fanfiction is ""fill in the gaps"" in the original work, and to create something it didn't have in the first place. Sometimes this is filling in on big, obvious things that don't get expanded upon in the original work--you have a character with a big, mysterious backstory that never gets explained? Well, let's explain it--but sometimes it can be more vague things. If a work is light, and you like it, but you also like darker stories, it's easy to want to make it darker. If a work is hella dark, and you like it, but damn, you just need an emotional breather, then you want to write about all the characters hugging it out and everyone being OK. And if there's little to no romance in the original, you'll get shipfics galore."

https://archiveofourown.org/works/719878/chapters/1334431

In the author’s notes you can also find a link to the Supernatural kink meme prompt (dated May 2010) that prompted the first omegaverse fic.

However, the author also has this to say about the genesis of the omegaverse:

*“I'm always a little torn between pride at spawning something that became so popular and chiding myself because all of this rests on the back of werewolf AU tropes that were already pervasive (alpha, beta, omega, knotting, heat, those were all out there). a/b/o really just stripped away the superpowers and monthly furriness, lol.”*

Like, I'd actually be down to read f!alpha/m!omega! Hetero mpreg isn't something you see often! But it's hard for me to see the appeal of m!alpha/f!omega because... that's just your ordinary rapey bodice ripper with wolf ears on."
3261,2020-10-10 22:06:49,iy0099,"It feels very weird to see A/B/O described as ‘pretty queer in nature,’ seeing as it’s usually a vector for straight cis women to write gay smut. It’d be like trying to infer things about actual lesbians based on lesbian porn made by and for cishet men."

3273,2020-09-23 23:59:02,iy0099,Oh whoops! Guess I wasn’t clear. I believe the ones in her video are made up. Which does make them super funny.
3274,2020-09-24 00:07:00,iy0099,I’m not trying to argue that fanfiction is exempt from criticism but I do believe that taking fanfic and metaphorically putting it on display just to go “isn’t it weird? Isn’t it just childish? Look at them they can’t do real writing? Why are they so horny all the time?” Is pretty shitty. Some one who wants to talk critically about fanfic or to engage with it beyond just laughing because it exists is something I’m actually interested in. Also? You have to actively seek it out too which does make me less charitable when it comes to my stance on unsolicited criticism.
3275,2020-09-23 13:51:39,iy0099,"Haha, I'm not a fan of mpreg, so I can't point you to any specific places or pieces of content, but, as with other kinky stuff, I'm sure you'll be able to find plenty of fics on AO3 (and some on FF) and plenty of fanart on Tumblr (though after the Second Tumblr Exodus it might as well be on Twitter, Pixiv, Newgrounds, FurAffinity, Hentai Foundry, and so on; not sure if people still post NSFW stuff on dA, and not sure if Paheal or TBIB/*booru sites are worth checking out if it's not manga/anime stuff). I remember seeing some mpreg fanart in the TF threads on /y/, too."
3276,2020-09-23 17:05:43,iy0099,"TBH that does genuinely sound interesting. May I ask for a link, if you're comfortable with that? If not, that's totally fine!"
3277,2020-09-23 08:07:29,iy0099,"Yeah but this stuff has *werewolves* in it.

...Sometimes. I've seen ABOs that more or less suggests the werewolf thing. Like, they're not literally werewolves so much as they're werewolf-flavored. Werewolf analogs. Knotting, heat, and all that other jazz but no actual fur or red rockets. Hitting all the beats of werewolf erotica, but with none of the furry bait. 

Jokes aside, werewolf erotica itself is more or less an exaggerated rendition of male-female gender dynamics as well. Big, bestial man who can't help himself but to force his big, chiseled fluffy boi body onto some tiny, buxom beauty. It's the quintessential woman x monster pairing before stuff like Shape of Water came along. 

Personally, I'd prefer an alien paramour. Or maybe an eldritch squeeze. Werewolves are just so blasé. 

When you break it down, the shit's basically the same hierarchical society setup you see in every 'mature' YA trilogy, just horny instead of political. Sometimes omegas double down on the uke thing and just straight up have female reproductive systems. Like, skedaddle right past the traditional womb-free mpreg and just make all omegas hermaphrodites. Nothing's all that cohesive in ABO outside of the alphas, betas an omegas themselves. I guess that was the beauty of it. It's kind of an open source kink."
3278,2020-09-23 19:21:18,iy0099,"I’ve always had an aversion to A/B/O (especially m/m). I figured if you wanted to write a male character as an omega then why not simply do a gender swap fic, since a lot of the stock omega tropes could easily be applied to a female character without any further alteration of the universe? Those “feminine” tropes (like submissiveness) plus female-adjacent anatomy (like self-lubricating assholes) are among the reasons I tend to avoid het romance altogether. But, it makes sense that the same things I find squicky in slash A/B/O are also why others find it a safe place to explore gender dynamics in a way they can find entertaining rather than emotionally draining. Thank you for your insight!"

3292,2020-09-23 20:08:13,iy0099,"I believe so, yes!  Here's a link to the timeline, actually.  Because fandom historians of *course* wrote an essay on it.  https://netweight.dreamwidth.org/204215.html"

But yeah, I'm glad people are having fun with it."
3294,2020-11-14 16:44:29,iy0099,thanks!
3295,2020-09-23 22:25:50,iy0099,"Sure! I don't think they've shared much publicly, but [this is the one](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20915774) that sold me on the potential of A/B/O as a genre.

I think it works pretty well as a standalone piece, but here's the fandom context: Fodlan is a continent with three major countries dominated by a central church. The church has, essentially, a military finishing school for the children of nobility, but there are a few non-nobles there as well. The school has three ""houses,"" which correlate to the three nations: the Blue Lions (Kingdom of Faerghus/Gryffindor), the Black Eagles (the Empire of something/Slytherin), and the Golden Deer (the something Alliance/Hufflepuff).

 Ashe is the common-born adopted son of a minor lord (Lonato, who turns out to be a villain) in Faerghus, which is a really regressive divine-right-of-kings kind of a place that very recently killed most of its indigenous population in a pogrom (the character Dedue is a surviving member of that group and a close friend of the Prince). Some nobles have innate magical abilities called Crests."
3296,2020-09-23 10:55:50,iy0099,"Hrm yknow it is definitely true that most werewolf erotica has exactly the same weird dynamic as well. Doing that without the actual ""turning into a wolf"" bit does seem to take the most interesting part out, but then I guess this is why I don't read much erotica"
3297,2020-09-23 17:10:59,iy0099,"Upvoting for the phrases ""eldritch squeeze"" and ""open source kink,"" because that's funny right dere."

3301,2020-09-23 08:55:30,iy0099,"I seem to recall that loads of Kurt/Blaine fanfics had stuff like slavery involved. This just sent me down a weird trip down memory lane back to when I was a teen just reading whatever. 

On the other end of the weirdness spectrum I recall a great X-men fanfic where Professor X and Magneto were crabs -like the plot wasn't that they were turned into crabs or anything, they always have been crabs and were chilling around their reef. It was pretty good actually."
3302,2020-09-24 22:07:53,iy0099,"FOR REAL people just go nuts and it's great.

Although my current fave fanfic of all time is *extremely* mundane, but it's so well done I forget it's not canon lol"
3303,2021-03-03 01:25:04,iy0099,Is it still common after the massive backlash towards the ending?
3304,2020-09-23 15:56:55,iy0099,"Its out there, you just have to know where and how to look especually because so many of the genre specific kinks are not super Amazon friendly."
3305,2020-09-23 21:34:24,iy0099,"You have to know where to look. I wound up with one that involved geoduck-duck hybrids that excreted hormones or something and while I was 100% not interested in that, I ended up reading the whole thing out of a morbid fascination of where it would go. I end up with a bunch of the weird stuff from pure curiosity."
3306,2020-09-23 19:54:37,iy0099,"Not sure my personal dislikes would suddenly remove forty or so downvotes. People who’re going to get mad at you for expressing an opinion to begin with don’t want to hear about why someone is specifically displeasing to you. 

Thanks anyway."
3307,2020-09-23 19:55:36,iy0099,"Thanks for the explanation. I never was on LJ, so its culture is foreign to me."
3308,2020-09-23 17:49:43,iy0099,"Tbh yeah... like I like MPreg/preg fics if it's done in a  creepy horror kind of way where the preg is Something That Should Not Be ~~guess who doesn't want kids lmao~~ but when it's fluffy, that's just not my thing. I do kind of like the idea of pack dynamics, though I'd prefer actual irl wolf dynamics. 

Either way, it's not my business, but it is interesting seeing how tropes can morph and expand until we get to, well. This lawsuit lol. 🤣"

3314,2020-09-24 22:40:57,iy0099,For a long while I was really obsessed with that fanfic that is Tom Riddle/Indiana Jones. I have no clue whether I would still find it good by today's standards but as a(n admittedly horny) young teen I used to love it

3326,2020-09-24 07:29:38,iy0099,The worst thing is that I remember growing up and being really puzzled by people mentioning that they are doing adult things in the comments under their fics.

3327,2020-10-09 06:51:30,iy0099,"The royal one actually ended up having the author edit it extensively and publish it as an original series of two books, online!

 I got a copy to see the changes out of curiosity and I actually enjoyed that version slightly more, the edits helped the overall story, it wasn’t just a ‘find-and-replace-the-names’ deal."

3334,2020-09-21 00:35:49,iwpuxn,"Nah, it's not weird. Personally I wouldn't want anything to do with a teenager, but you're both above the age of consent and you're not 37 or something. It's fine."
3335,2020-09-21 00:29:40,iwpuxn,I don't think it's make u weird I mean it's not like he's not an adult right?
3336,2020-09-21 00:28:40,iwpuxn,No the lowest for most people is 3 years younger later in life it won't be a big deal the age difference

:)

I recall reading something, maybe in a Gallo book, that Phil's drum track on Apocalypse was his first take, listening to the keyboard solo or something in headphones.

Anyone else hear this?  Does it make sense?

If it is true, i'm gobsmacked, given how brilliant the drumming is."
3344,2020-09-17 12:30:08,it39xz,"Keep these going! I always enjoy other peoples’ insights; for example, I listened to Calling All Stations once a couple years ago, and thought it was pretty meh, but a weird ‘90s sounding album. After reading through LordChozo’s Hindsight posts, I went back through CAS several times, and like or can appreciate most tracks - even if most are fairly middle of the road. It works best when I’ve had a rough day and want melodramatic, dark sounds."
3345,2020-09-15 15:33:37,it39xz,"Definitely, I won't ever rush these. I have had an idea though for a smaller scale series that I could do in the meantime focusing on something this subreddit generally doesn't discuss. I also view these reviews as always open for improvement and additions, so there is no ""final version"" for these."
3346,2020-09-17 15:06:58,it39xz,"I did mention how the rhythm section always grabs my attention the most during Tony's solo, but to know that Phil's drumming was possibly done in one take is astounding! *Supper's Ready* and especially that section in particular is a musician's delight.

Oh and trust me, I tend not to give 9's or 10's to things I just like. I find an average rating from adding all the songs together and then decide to simplify it either up or down. In this case I don't feel like it quite hits a 9, but is definitely a strong 8."

When relistening under different conditions though, I found a lot more to enjoy and is one of their albums I'm particularly excited to talk about at some point.

**Buyers and sellers, use the link above to verify where to redeem codes to ensure 4K codes redeem properly.**

**Feedback Logging (*Does not apply to GIVEAWAYS*)**

* Once a transaction has been completed, one user (buyer or seller) must create a comment (can be in-line with the deal discussion) tagging both [u/DCSbot](https://www.reddit.com/u/DCSbot) and the user they transacted with, for example  u\/IamtheZZ.
 * The u/ is required, and the username for the bot ***MUST BE TYPED NOT COPY/PASTED*** to work properly.
* Once this is done, the tagged user must respond to that comment for feedback to be logged.
* If successful, the bot will respond to the second comment with ""Added"", and the number will increment for both.

All discussions/negotiations about a potential transaction must be made via comments. Exchange codes/payment via PM or Reddit Chat. This helps to prevent scams and track trusted buyers and sellers.  **DO NOT RESPOND TO OFFERS MADE VIA PM OR CHAT.**

This post was originally made by IamtheZZ as a reference in case they ever delete this post.

3808,2020-10-19 00:39:29,jdn8l1,"I don’t think they will add that tag but even if they did I think John Smith, Kristoff and Flynn Rider should all be excluded as they are most definitely not Prince’s. I think if they expand their offerings they have plenty of actual princes.

1) Charming (Cinderella)
2) Philip (Sleeping Beauty)
3) Adam/Beast (Beauty & the Beast)
4) Naveen (Princess & the Frog)
5) Eric
6) Aladdin (I almost put Aladdin in the same category as John Smith/Flynn/Kristoff as he is more an “anti-Prince” not that he’s a bad guy but just that he fits more of that good hearted rogue

If they all come about and all have the prince rage I think that there should be two distinct teams kind of like Tech.

The “true princes” which are the first 5 on my list then the prince by association which can be John Smith, Kristoff, Aladdin, Flynn, and Li Shang from Mulan."
3809,2020-10-19 01:17:42,jdn8l1,"I agree! There should be a different category for characters like John Smith, or maybe no category at all. I’d almost argue that Aladdin is definitely a prince, though. Prince Ali. And he marries a princess! Doesn’t that make him a prince?"
3810,2020-10-19 03:41:42,jdn8l1,"He’s that odd middle ground. If you look at the others I listed, they are all prince’s in their own right.

Aladdin was only pretending to be a prince as Ali and the married Jasmine, but Flynn marries Rapunzel and Kristoff Anna and yet I think they are clearly not princes. That’s why I said they were Prince By Association i.e. only a prince because they married one."

Like many, I’ve been connecting with friends and family. Social media allows us to share information about the Black Lives Matter movement, or put crucial resources on our stories or profiles about things going on in the world. It has given people awareness and the means to take action, which maybe they wouldn’t have if they didn’t see it on their timeline or feed. The negative part of social media is that it can create feelings of inadequacy — we need to examine the debilitating and damaging aspects that social media can bring into our lives, especially when we’re using it as a crutch in times of uncertainty

Banks are in business utilizing different resources to make profit.   So I reiterate why can’t Disney do what they do?  It keeps people employed does it not?

4088,2020-12-11 13:54:00,kavu8a,Too. Much. Information.
4089,2020-12-11 14:23:20,kavu8a,"That's.... A lot. I can't say I'm thrilled about at least half of the projects announced and it *really* seems like they're scraping the bottom of the barrel for which Star Wars/Marvel characters they can spin-off, but at the very least it means I'll probably have to actually get a Disney+ subscription. On top of bringing out enough new originals that there's gotta be a Star Wars and Marvel episode of something every week for the whole year, their plans to bring more mature stuff to Disney+ means there might actually be a good back-catalogue of FX shows to catch up on. 

Overall the MCU stuff is standing out to me in just how consistently they're plucking directors and writers from seemingly nowhere. Star Wars keep announcing names I'm excited to hear are helming their shows/TV- Taika Waititi, Tony Gilroy, Patty Jenkins Leslye Headland, Justin Simien and Deborah Chow are all known quantities at this point and really exciting picks. Unless I'm missing something on the MCU front, there's not a single big name here, almost every announced writer/director has no more than a few episodes of a minor sitcom under their belts. Have established names like Taika Waititi, Ryan Coogler and James Gunn not given us possibly the best stuff in the MCU? Has The Mandalorian not shown that those big names can slot well into a TV format? It's obviously too early to say but as someone who's usually more excited by who's behind the camera than who's in front, it's giving me the impression that Marvel are seeking out writers/directors who will just do what they're told with no real style or flair. Picking someone like Jon Watts based on their experience with low-budget indie films that actually have some personality is a lot different than seemingly throwing darts at a list of random sitcom writers/directors."

4108,2020-12-11 23:07:50,kavu8a,Like butter scraped over too much bread
4109,2020-12-12 01:52:47,kavu8a,"And still no The Owl House?! I know they approved a second season. The anticipation of a release date is growing day by day!

If there is a release date that I haven't found yet, please for the love of god, correct me."
4110,2020-12-13 00:35:47,kavu8a,Ahsoka will be a flop
4111,2020-12-11 15:28:45,kavu8a,I am surprised to see Disney trusting Zemeckis with Pinocchio. His commercial track record has been abysmal for a decade and his critical scores haven't been stellar either.
4112,2020-12-11 23:20:50,kavu8a,"Holy fuck that's a lot of sequels, remakes and other derivative works."
4113,2020-12-11 19:46:39,kavu8a,"When ecological induced colpase of society happens, Disney will weave off with some millionaires and talented people to live on the moon and feed the rest of the population with vast multi-verse of dreams as so they can forget the terrible reality while they are stocked in tank under the sea near the costs in strategical places that are less so to hit by heat waves or radiations. You better get that premium access NOW"
4114,2021-03-05 08:08:49,kavu8a,Just about everything listed is incredibly disappointing. Disney magic is on hiatus.
4115,2020-12-11 09:21:51,kavu8a,"I have an original idea, Disney

Chang Latoya Muhammed Yakamoto is an outcast at school, but then she discovers that she can achieve everything she wants to in life!!!  And she meets friends along the way who teach her what's important in life!!

Here's another one:

Tayshaun Cheong Ahmed Singh feels like an outcast in his school.  But then he meets friends who inspire him to overcome all obstacles!!!  And they learn valuable lessons along the way!!!

Every idea Disney has here is garbage.  Nothing but SJW cringe in absolute every single one of these.  All trash.  Never have I been more thankful to have grown up in the era I did than now.  Holy fuckin shit, the sad part is that Disney will profit off all this SJW drivel.  Today's parents are so weak, they don't know how to raise kids right.  Just slap on a Disney vid and call it a day.  And Mouse laughs all the way to the bank."
4116,2020-12-11 16:41:39,kavu8a,I don't get how how it will work. He wasn't the voice of Vader as soon as the suit was on so I assume it must be flashbacks or something.
4117,2020-12-11 15:04:47,kavu8a,"It's the ""as Darth Vader"" that is exciting me.

Order 66 flashbacks? Darth Vader in the suit?

I was expecting a flashback to him and Obi-Wan chatting on Coruscant sure, but as Darth Vader?? Wasn't expecting that.

Exciting."
4118,2020-12-11 11:28:06,kavu8a,Noooooooooooooooooooo. .. but also.. yeeeeeesssssssssss
4119,2020-12-11 13:46:02,kavu8a,So excited to neither see nor hear him. He's going to be so good

4123,2020-12-11 14:55:43,kavu8a,"That's cool and all, but he still can't act."
4124,2020-12-11 08:32:42,kavu8a,"dont want to spoil your excitement but technically speaking hayden already made a ""return"" when he said a quick line to rey in rise of skywalker. that said this should be a more meaningful return in the sense that he may actually get to show his face for once. but since hes vader i doubt we will actually get to see his face at all"
4125,2020-12-11 14:02:03,kavu8a,In the Investor's Meeting livestream they had 2D screenshots of it so I'm guessing that it's 2D.
4126,2020-12-11 05:28:24,kavu8a,"I'm wondering that too. If it'll be 2D like the Tangled series, or if it'll be 3D since this is being made in house at Walt Disney Animation Studios."
4127,2020-12-11 05:36:58,kavu8a,"Obviously, the original is 2D"

4132,2020-12-11 06:11:21,kavu8a,"30$ extra on top of Disney+, same as the Mulan live action release."
4133,2020-12-11 06:06:58,kavu8a,"Probably same thing as Mulan, paid on top of subscription. I just hope it's not $30US this time."
4134,2020-12-11 06:23:22,kavu8a,Time Variance Authority. They're basically Time Cops and he appears to be in a leadership role there

4136,2020-12-11 06:08:19,kavu8a,"From the trailer, it looks like he's some kind of agent of an unknown agency. Took me a second to recognize him with the short gray hair and mustache."

4141,2020-12-11 17:59:01,kavu8a,Or the fact that Loki’s show takes place after Endgame. Which answers a big question about his infinity wars fate
4142,2020-12-11 05:06:12,kavu8a,Three Men and a Bride and Another Baby
4143,2020-12-11 05:40:06,kavu8a,Then three men and Satan. Where the 3 men are stalked by the demonic child who committed suicide on set in the curtains.

4145,2020-12-11 09:25:19,kavu8a,"> this whole slate looks amazing

No it doesn't.

How bout 3 ladies and a baby.  She's all grown up, bu hangs out with Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Catral, and the 3 have to raise a baby boy"
4146,2020-12-11 06:01:50,kavu8a,"It would make the title ""Star Wars"" pretty weird if the war ended"
4147,2020-12-11 06:20:29,kavu8a,Ten Star Wars shows & poor Jar Jar still hasn't had a spin off series. It would be a nice touch if he could make a few cameo appearances.
4148,2020-12-11 07:27:39,kavu8a,Almost like they want to achieve a significant profit from their billions of investment in purchasing lucas film.
4149,2020-12-11 07:00:49,kavu8a,"how are people so upset over this, star wars has a established a massive universe, ofc things happen in it?? what’s wrong with exploring it, if anything it’d be a shame to create the universe and not utilize it. Same thing with everything they’re doing for Marvel. As long as they’re not sacrificing quality, there’s no reason to complain about more content."
4150,2020-12-11 10:09:16,kavu8a,It reminds me of jaws 27 or whatever it was from back to the future 2
4151,2020-12-11 19:36:32,kavu8a,It *is* plural...
4152,2020-12-11 16:53:06,kavu8a,"I think that’s the most realistic thing about it, endless war"
4153,2020-12-11 22:22:39,kavu8a,More than one of these are event series and not going to have multiple seasons.
4154,2020-12-12 11:07:57,kavu8a,That's what I was thinking about all the marvel shit lol
4155,2020-12-12 12:46:17,kavu8a,"
>This looks like a tv guide from a dystopian future

That is a low bar for a dystopian future. It could be so much more worse really.

Oddly enough, people are happy for it, so it's quite the reverse actually."
4156,2020-12-11 14:52:47,kavu8a,"ENDLESS TRASH!

I'm happy for everyone who loves this stuff but they are stripping these IPs bare like there's no tomorrow."
4157,2020-12-11 09:15:10,kavu8a,I'm just so tired of all these star wars.
4158,2020-12-11 10:19:14,kavu8a,We have always been at war with east galaxy.
4159,2020-12-11 09:28:10,kavu8a,"> tv guide from a dystopian future

Nailed it.

Are people so dumb that they will literally watch the whole ""social outcast finds his place in society"" trope over and over and over again.  Holy shit, what happened to society"
4160,2020-12-11 16:28:19,kavu8a,They’re fucking milking it like a lactating Scarlett Johansson
4161,2020-12-11 07:57:03,kavu8a,They want to make sure that star wars and marvel fans always have something new to watch monthly so they cannot skip subscription months
4162,2020-12-11 12:42:58,kavu8a,This is the response to a year of people complaining that Disney+ has no good original content outside the Mandalorian.
4163,2020-12-11 16:46:04,kavu8a,">You know that feeling when you eat to much sweets and feel like you'll get sick if you have any more sugar?


You may want to get some variety on your media diet then, champ.

That's how you fight over sweetness, cleanse your palate and stop being a little bitch, as if the mouse is holding a gun to your head to watch all of this. They're not all for you, dummy. 

Don't like the sugar? Seek some savory in ""foreign"" film (as I'm sure you've American), build up the patience to ""read"" subtitles and expand your horizons of media consumption. 

You're getting mad at popcorn movies being sold as popcorn movies."
4164,2020-12-11 06:16:42,kavu8a,It's pretty crazy a guy can make wild shit for A24 and solid stuff for Disney as well. Takes a helluva balancing act to pull both off rather successfully.
4165,2020-12-11 08:01:34,kavu8a,Well I think something that should be stated is that Disney has given their plan for roughly the next four years. Every streaming service can make plans to compete since many don’t really unveil their plans that far out.
4166,2020-12-11 14:14:07,kavu8a,We don't that the sequel will be about a marriage fallout though do we ?
4167,2020-12-11 19:44:16,kavu8a,Anything else is treason.
4168,2020-12-12 16:55:50,kavu8a,"I feel like if he was, they would have said so."
4169,2020-12-11 08:51:35,kavu8a,They’ve been doing this since the 90’s - every movie back then had at least 3 sequels and an animated show. It’s just Disney+ is the new direct-to-video.
4170,2020-12-11 08:34:58,kavu8a,"thats what it feels like, but heres why youre wrong. this was an investor call, disney is basically telling investors what they plan on doing in the near future. as a result, this looks like a lot of shit, but remember, its not all coming out at once, so it wont feel like oversaturation since nobody is gonna be watching 10 star wars shows back to back"
4171,2020-12-11 06:44:36,kavu8a,"Thats what happens when you invest in a subscription service. You need compelling exclusives in order to suck in those sweet sweet monthly payments so Disney is scraping the bottom of the barrel for literally any IP they can milk.

Who knows what the quality is going to be like if they're going to rush all this to market."
4172,2020-12-11 10:28:03,kavu8a,"They are. The next 3 or 4 years is the climax of the streaming wars and this is Disney's main offensive. 


Once they have conclusively won or .ore realistically settled into a stalemate with Netflix and HBO Max,  they will likely settle down and release content more strategically paced. 


I think I'm starting to despise the word ""content"". It feels almost dystopic.



Oh well. I suppose ""looking on the bright side"" people will be getting their moneys worth with Disney+ for the next few years."
4173,2020-12-11 16:50:53,kavu8a,"That’s the whole goal of Disney though. Create an IP and build around it with movies, TV shows, theme park rides, and most importantly—toys. They need to make these shows around their IP to keep the name out there and to get people to buy the toys."
4174,2020-12-11 16:11:51,kavu8a,You should watch Cobra Kai (Karate Kid universe show) on Netflix. That's madness.
4175,2020-12-11 09:35:22,kavu8a,How was Elaine Benes
4176,2020-12-11 05:49:48,kavu8a,Buck Naked if i'm not mistaken
4177,2020-12-11 16:12:11,kavu8a,"Seriously, half the thread is acting like they're strapped in to a Clockwork Orange machine."
4178,2020-12-11 18:18:53,kavu8a,"I think the main problem for me is that Marvel does want you to watch everything. All the shows are tying into the movies, so instead of watching maybe 10 hours of movies like normal, you have to watch an additional 10 hours of disney+ to understand it. I’m not going to do that, so I probably won’t watch the movies either"
4179,2020-12-11 06:15:30,kavu8a,"As long as it uses *Star Wars* as a setting and not an excuse to cram in a lot of Jedi stuff, I'm cool with this. The known galaxy in *Star Wars* is vast and stuff that's only been teased in the countless films and shows opens up avenues for storytellers to explore. Hell, I'd be game for a whole series that's basically *The Wire* meets *Blade Runner* on the lowest levels on Corusant."
4180,2020-12-11 05:02:28,kavu8a,"If it's Mandalorian-quality, it won't feel like oversaturation at all."
4181,2020-12-11 05:02:17,kavu8a,Yeah I mean this is enough content for 10 lifetimes worth. My theory is that since they’ve axed theatrical releases they gone all in on streaming services.
4182,2020-12-11 06:47:18,kavu8a,Yeah clearly they did that with Marvel and now nobody wants to watch anything Marvel anymore. Oh wait.
4183,2020-12-11 05:59:24,kavu8a,Because 450+ books didn’t do that?
4184,2020-12-11 05:52:11,kavu8a,"Are we seriously already complaining about the new Star Wars content?

How much bitching is reddit capable of?"
4185,2020-12-11 06:12:44,kavu8a,Honestly rather this than a bunch of movies. Plus different parts of the timeline with different takes. Some are limited series. The Visions thing might be the most intriguing thing for me as I love stuff like Animatrix and Batman: Gotham Knight
4186,2020-12-11 05:09:27,kavu8a,"I was hoping they would make Mandalorian seasons longer. 8 episodes isn't enough. If these other shows are just as good, I'm happy!"
4187,2020-12-11 19:41:12,kavu8a,Compared to what?  Star Trek had a new episode every week for decades.  Marvel comic books have been coming out over and over for decades more.  Pop culture *is* more content.
4188,2020-12-12 03:22:20,kavu8a,I say go for it. The Star Wars universe is literally a gigantic space universe with trillions of stories to tell. It’s perfect for serial television shows.
4189,2020-12-11 14:11:46,kavu8a,Our own universe is over saturated with not-Star-Wars.
4190,2020-12-11 23:42:29,kavu8a,Time to traumatize a new generation of kids with the donkey scene

4197,2020-12-11 12:14:13,kavu8a,"Yes, but what did you expect, it's what sells."
4198,2020-12-11 14:19:35,kavu8a,">  for the vast majority of these titles and shows we've been suffering from Marvel/Star Wars fatigue for years now.

Avengers: Endgame was the highest grossing movie of all time and we've had a more than a year since anything Marvel being released. It's wrong to say that the vast majority are experiencing Marvel fatigue. Star Wars is a bit different because of how poorly the sequel trilogy was handled but people seem to enjoy The Mandalorian."

4200,2020-12-11 12:17:43,kavu8a,"Ok, that made me laugh. I think Bombay should be found guilty of genocide and condemned to coach the Mighty Ducks for life."
4201,2020-12-11 17:31:14,kavu8a,"Different streaming services are focused on different genres. Disney knows their life blood is MCU/Star Wars, and animated shows/movies based on all the IP they have purchased.

That's in stark difference to Netflix that is dabbling in everything and anything trying to find something that sticks. Hell, they have Netflix sponsored Bollywood movies now, complete with song and dance."
4202,2020-12-11 16:03:59,kavu8a,Seems like a bunch are anthology style mini series. As long as they have a clear arc through like 10-12 episodes you can some really awesome stories that way.
4203,2020-12-11 18:27:07,kavu8a,"Personally I don’t like that the movies and shows are linked, because I don’t want to double how much marvel stuff I watch. So I probably won’t watch any marvel movies or shows at all, but thats just me and we’ll see if most audiences will continue to follow both"
4204,2020-12-11 19:46:32,kavu8a,You shoulda been around for Westerns..
4205,2020-12-12 01:29:15,kavu8a,she was probably under contract and couldnt confirm it until the disney official announcement.
4206,2020-12-11 12:51:22,kavu8a,"I'm personally loving all the schlock and it's fun and I like being fan serviced. But I get what you're saying and it reminds me of that movie Fanboys, which, for better or worse as a movie, has that story of just desperately wanting to live long enough to see that next thing, that big event or conclusion or whatever that the next generation will just never experience. I know Marvel/EU and everything have been going on for decades and that stories don't simply ""end"" in comics and novels and whatever, but it just makes me think that I'll never get an ending to die with that someone who saw Jedi in 1983 might have been able to. Morbid, but I take your point."

In the main timeline, Loki is still dead. Killed in IW.

The show takes place in the timeline where Tony and crew went back to New York 2012 get the Tesseract. It was knocked out of the suitcase and Loki picked it up and teleported away. The series will be following that Loki."

like pls the Star Wars/Marvel bubble needs to be burst so that people don't get so caught up on expanding the lore of an overstuffed universe that they forget how to actually be creative"
4250,2020-12-11 11:46:30,kavu8a,"Some people are upset because it looks like creative bankruptcy, i am not quite sure how you can say they'll explore the universe with these shows either tbh, it's really all things linked to already established names and ideas. That's not exploration, that's minimal risk and handing out a ton of fan service.  
The idea of quality is almost meaningless in such a construct, yeah ofc it will be up to a certain standard with disney's budget, but that's about it. Star Wars started as a milestone which pushed boundaries, i am not the biggest fan of the franchise, but even i have to at least give it props there, now it is no more than a brand name used to print as many dollars as possible."
4251,2020-12-11 11:35:23,kavu8a,">star wars has a established a massive universe, ofc things happen in it??

So far in Disney's Star Wars universe they've taken place in a short 20 years period (basically the middle of the Empire through just after) or it's the Sequels, which take place 30 years later but looks exactly like the OT era. Look at most of these shows. It's again mostly more Empire vs Rebels era stuff. They need to branch out and stop with just Empire stuff"
4252,2020-12-11 07:33:39,kavu8a,"Its like a carbon copy of them announting 15 or so star wars movies just as TFA was a smash hit, right after they got one successful TV series."

There are probably a lot of great ideas just waiting to happen that could use backing, but Disney are playing it super safe instead."

And they're really scraping the bottom of the barrel for content looking at what stories they are trying to tell. This shit is like spinoffs of spinoffs, who actually wants this nonsense even if it is good?"

4260,2020-12-12 01:12:01,kavu8a,"That’s exactly what they’re doing, and I think it’s smart. I initially subscribed for three reasons:

1: Mandalorian

2: National Geographic

3: To share my account with my dad and step mom because I know they’d love it, but would never get their own account

The problems I have though is that Mandalorian is the only show that I really enjoy on there and their selection for NatGeo friggin sucks. I mean they have literally decades of material that they could put up, but there’s almost nothing on the NatGeo side. 

With The Mandalorian wrapping up I’ve been thinking about just canceling my subscription and just reactivating when something good comes along, but then I remember reason number three. I love getting texts from my dad saying “We just watched ~insert movie here~ last night. It really made me think about all the times I watched it with you and your brothers. Thanks again for sharing with us, son” and that’s why it’s worth whatever I pay each year."

That’s 12 movies worth of content, which is releasing over 3 years, even though thats the amount released over the past 5 years. And that doesn’t even include most movies"

You can watch Ant-man without knowledge of any of the previous films. But you can't watch Captain America 3 without watching, at minimum, the previous captain america movies. Marvel has been pretty good about this. They're following the comic logic- people will follow their favorite character's arc, but don't necessarily have time to see every comic available. So as long as the person follows their favorite character, they're gonna be fine."
4274,2020-12-11 08:31:33,kavu8a,"yea just based off of the blurbs about what we know is in the works, theres a huge diversity of star wars content that theyre pursuing. theyve got sequel era shows like the mandalorian, theyve got prequel era shows like kenobi, theyve got movies set in the high republic era, a period of time nobody has seen yet, theyve got a war movie coming up with patty jenkins, etc"

4282,2020-12-11 12:00:25,kavu8a,"While i do not necessarily subscribe to the idea that this will definitely lead to an oversaturation for star wars, it's also not as simple as saying ""hey it didn't happen with marvel therefore it won't happen with star wars"".   
Each IP is different, with strengths and weaknesses (also marvel's big success so far was mostly cinema driven in the space of live action mediums) which apply differently to the zeitgeist, etc.  
This is a lot of stuff, the mandalorian being a hit is great, but will it translate into people wanting to see a show about some guy from rogue one? Do people really wanna see a lando series? Idk, we'll have to see."

4309,2020-12-11 23:02:47,kavu8a,"yeah this is slightly different since it's a concurrent access thing- it's gonna be in theaters AND available to buy at the same time. at the release date, it's gonna likely be before the vaccine is ready, so people will be wary about the theaters. This basically keeps the theaters happy with Disney (they get something to show) and keeps the ""GIVE ME EVERYTHING IMMEDIATELY"" folks happy too. There's a choice rather than a forced one. Also they said it was gonna be one-offs for the most part- not every movie will have the option to do so, but they reserve the right to do it when they feel like it."

They used their setting of a warfront to tell stories about what battle really does to a man, and how the veneer of civilization starts to deteriorate when faced with an existential threat. That's a story TNG could *never* tell because of the show's premise - a mission of exploration and discovery.

4327,2020-12-11 20:18:46,kavu8a,"I mean I'm with ya, I'll also be going into *any* of these shows with a healthy dose of skepticism, and there is no reason to feel loyalty or trust towards Disney. But reading the descriptions of these shows, especially The Acolyte and Visions, I think they're at least trying to make it LOOK like they're putting the effort in. They're introducing a new, completely unexplored era, they're trying out new styles and creative leads... And some of this other stuff, the Kenobi show, The Bad Batch, a live-action Ahsoka show, people have been begging them for this stuff for ages, we all expected these announcements. Plus it looks like Dave Filoni is really stepping up, who was the voice of reason in the Star Wars universe and history even back under Lucas.

Like yeah, obviously this is all profit-motivated, and if they can just pull all of this out of their ass in a year then the more moral move would have been to chuck that same money at 500 young, brilliant sci-fi writers desperate to make their mark with their own original series. But was anybody expecting that?

Also, I'm learning that I really, really like big collaborative worldbuilding projects. Maybe it's a kid's way of thinking, but I like lightsabers and The Force and Jedi, and I want to see lots of stories from that world. I like the lore, I like seeing new takes on the stuff I grew up with. It's like a big DnD game where all the players are actors and Filoni is the DM."
4328,2020-12-11 18:01:44,kavu8a,"The Acolyte is sitting right there. Mark my words, if it becomes the biggest of the shows they’ll double down on fresh Star Wars settings. On the other hand, if its Andor... More Rebels vs Empire."

This doesn't have much to do with anything but most marriages don't really end in divorce.

4342,2020-12-11 16:05:20,kavu8a,I'm really not feeling this second season. It feels like Iron Man 2 to me how they just keep introducing more shit to build the world and service the fans. I liked the smaller scale of the first season more.
4343,2020-12-11 05:42:34,kavu8a,And whatever Taika is doing
4344,2020-12-11 14:10:47,kavu8a,I think the OP was specifically just referring to Star Wars theatrical releases.
4345,2020-12-11 14:07:12,kavu8a,">there’s only 50 canon novels

Sure, but there were over 30 years of books before then. That’s their point."
4346,2020-12-11 13:36:57,kavu8a,This is the way.
4347,2020-12-12 03:31:57,kavu8a,They did back off from movies for a while. They had planned to release a Star Wars movie every year indefinitely.
4348,2020-12-11 15:28:53,kavu8a,"> It’s Star Wars **and Disney**, Reddit is going to bitch about it one way or the other

There, I fixed that for you."
4349,2020-12-11 19:43:11,kavu8a,"I mean, that’s how Star Trek was for decades before I was born and for decades after.  It’s kinda par for the course."
4350,2020-12-11 16:09:19,kavu8a,"I was thinking that at first, but then I realized the Mandalorian is only like 4 hours per season, so casual fans could probably get caught up in one or two weekends a year if they feel the need to watch everything. I grew up watching the same 6 VHS tapes over and over so I'm certainly not complaining."
4351,2020-12-11 14:58:08,kavu8a,We got that with *Last Jedi* but the internet had a stroke and vowed to execute Mickey Mouse if Disney didn't toe the line from now on.
4352,2020-12-11 16:38:35,kavu8a,I don't give a shit personally ... BUT Disney has a terrible track record with Star Wars lately. Can’t be surprised if people are hesitant to be excited. Also... you can only take in so much of this until it becomes over saturated and boring. I think I’ve hit that point with the Marvel content.
4353,2020-12-11 05:26:39,kavu8a,You mean billion? Cuz that’s a reasonable content budget for a streaming platform
4354,2020-12-11 05:26:57,kavu8a,2.4 billion*.
4355,2020-12-11 12:41:48,kavu8a,"Our planet is literally dying around us (and it's all our fault) so I can see why it's hard for people to look to the future with any real optimism. That doesn't mean that I don't want more original work too, I do, but I also feel that a declining civilization is the least of our problems."
4356,2020-12-11 21:42:22,kavu8a,"Characters have always been written and actors have always been chosen to appeal to different audience groups. You are only just starting to notice because for the first time in your life, mainstream American franchises are trying to appeal to groups you don't belong to. But that's okay, because nothing about disabled people, muslim people, women, black people, asians, etc. should be off-putting to you, even if you aren't specifically interested by those traits.

Like, not caring whether a character is black is one thing. Not wanting to watch a show or movie *because* a character is black? There's a word for that."

4360,2020-12-11 16:32:51,kavu8a,"My favorite little detail about this is when Funko released the pop for it, they called him [King Kong](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Funko-POP-Kong-Skull-Island-King-Kong-Vinyl-Figure/55376918), but shortly after changed the name to just [Kong](https://www.mercari.com/us/item/m31108326693/?gclsrc=aw.ds&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=11236142580&utm_content=t0&adgroup=110539761496&network=g&device=c&merchant_id=126358573&product_id=m31108326693&product_id=361155090397&gclid=Cj0KCQiAzsz-BRCCARIsANotFgM6nsI5HP7wj8Yzg2qtgcFgCqdyJZi-BLM8I4SeeHRDzIrieiMs1qMaAtoEEALw_wcB)."
4361,2020-12-11 14:14:06,kavu8a,This doesn't sound kid friendly. Best to stick with decapitating sith lords.
4362,2020-12-11 15:45:26,kavu8a,"The Empire was defeated, what is left is a fraction of what they were at their strongest. They are now an empire by name only, and the age of the new republic is in full swing. 

That is why the empire (and the show) doesn't take place in the core worlds, they are fighting to survive in the outer planets, and they hope to rise up to power. It is implied in the latest episode that they will eventually turn into the New Order. 

But it is telling that the entire remaining empire's main struggles are with one man and his friends, the Mandolorian."
4363,2020-12-11 18:21:33,kavu8a,Slaymo!
4364,2020-12-12 00:31:10,kavu8a,Yeah I figured that's how people would choose to read it. You do you boo.
4365,2020-12-11 21:33:37,kavu8a,"Sure that is totally fair, but i think it is reasonably fair to be a little pessimistic looking at it. You're right with your comment though, no doubt."
4366,2020-12-11 12:23:49,kavu8a,"I agree, there is no difference there, i'd also say all of that is creativeley bankrupt in a way (i am not familiar with everything out there regarding SW though, i am sure some of the things were truly trying to explore new ideas and concepts)  
The concept of milking an IP didn't start with disney+ obviously, but it is still disappointing to see where the priorities lie and maybe even more importantly, how it seems to work as well as it does."
4367,2020-12-11 13:24:19,kavu8a,">So far in Disney's Star Wars universe they've taken place in a short 20 years period (basically the middle of the Empire **through just after**).

Most of these series are literally in the era after the Prequels to a little after the Empire. They will be drenched in OT iconography. Mandalorian is supposed to be 5 years after the Empire. There has been more Empire iconography than anything else in the show. And the sequel era literally just OT iconography. Most of these shows will continue with the same exact iconography of a this tiny period in the Star Wars universe"
4368,2020-12-11 22:47:04,kavu8a,Also there's literal decades of comic stories and characters they can use to the point that it can be a new story for each show and they would still have enough a decade later. They haven't even *touched* Xmen yet. And that's a whole other basket of worms that can introduce a ridiculous amount of content on its own
4369,2020-12-11 15:58:50,kavu8a,"""no u"""
4370,2020-12-12 04:47:58,kavu8a,"If they didn't, ^*maybe* I would have scored better in my exams!"
4371,2020-12-12 12:30:31,kavu8a,"I guess for me what was a little sad was announcing a whole ton of stuff, and not one bit of it was a completely fresh idea"
4372,2020-12-12 17:04:04,kavu8a,"Not even kind of close. Just look where the numbers will be in a year. There’s ones piece of content that streaming audiences will care about and that Is WW. Disney+ just announced a battalion of fan friendly content. 

Hbo max will be closer to Quibi than Disney+"
4373,2020-12-11 22:15:53,kavu8a,Agreed. I loved the first season but so far the only episodes of season two I enjoyed were the first two. They felt self-contained.
4374,2020-12-11 05:56:05,kavu8a,And Avatar
4375,2020-12-11 15:06:42,kavu8a,And all of them were canon before Disney came in.
4376,2020-12-11 14:11:42,kavu8a,Reddit has spoken.
4377,2020-12-11 20:09:29,kavu8a,">It's Reddit, there will be bitching. 

There, fixed that for you both."
4378,2020-12-11 15:52:04,kavu8a,"“Where’s the new ideas that aren’t Star Wars”. 



“Well there was that one Star Wars movie”."
4379,2020-12-11 15:20:52,kavu8a,"The last jedi is still just another star wars movie.  It was incredibly safe, even if it was a little different than the usual star wars movie.  Same goes for rouge one and solo"
4380,2020-12-11 18:03:48,kavu8a,"> Disney has a terrible track record with Star Wars lately. 

*watches as The Mandalorian wins an Emmy and is regarded by fans as the best Star Wars content since the Original Trilogy*"
4381,2020-12-11 20:19:24,kavu8a,"> BUT Disney has a terrible track record with Star Wars lately.

I'd say more mixed than terrible. Sequel Trilogy and Solo are pretty bad. But The Mandalorian, Clone Wars: The Final Season, and Star Wars Rebels are all pretty great."
4382,2020-12-11 05:42:04,kavu8a,Tis but a bit of Uncle Scrooge's vault.
4383,2020-12-11 12:48:01,kavu8a,"Oh that's just all part of it. Goes into the whole ""not planning ahead"" aspect. But we digress, it's going too far off-topic.

I just feel that Hollywood hasn't really churned out a lot of truly original work in the last few decades, and it seems to be getting worse and worse with the double-down on exploiting established brands."
4384,2020-12-11 21:57:43,kavu8a,They're overdoing it
4385,2020-12-11 17:08:02,kavu8a,"A summer where people aren’t dying from a pandemic comes:

*whip sound*"
4386,2020-12-11 13:56:37,kavu8a,"And I am completely fine with that. I don’t *hate* the sequel trilogy the way some people do, but until they start doing something interesting with it, I much prefer the classic and prequel eras."
4387,2020-12-11 16:43:57,kavu8a,"Well yes because it is true. It was the star wars fandom which harassed actors and actresses because they didn't like a fictional character, it was them who couldn't deal with brie larson being a little critical of certain hollywood standards, it was them who cried like little babies when they didn't like a film and wanted to destroy the lifes of people involved. All of that is more edgelord mentality than being aware that a lot of entertainment is incredibly mediocre while producing more and more money with it, you don't need to be a reddit warrior to see it, a lot of people point this out, including legendary directors and artists."
4388,2020-12-11 06:10:47,kavu8a,And my Axe!
4389,2020-12-11 08:19:04,kavu8a,"They speak only of Star Wars there. Otherwise, they got plenty of other things. In fact, I don't think they really decreased their number of theatrical films while upping massively the production for Disney+ original content. There will still be 3 MCU movies a year for example.

Btw, it is weird how they didn't even mention Avatar 2 and 3 in that presentation."
4390,2020-12-11 15:08:01,kavu8a,"Well, yes and no. They were all canon to each other, but George certainly didn’t consider them part of his story. 

Not saying that as a bad thing about the EU - just how it was."
4391,2020-12-11 16:10:27,kavu8a,I am Groot
4392,2020-12-12 11:45:38,kavu8a,">Those are bitch, they will be redditing

I'm not sure I understand what we are playing..."
4393,2020-12-11 18:04:58,kavu8a,Obviously the exception among their output.
4394,2020-12-11 20:24:38,kavu8a,Hmmm... that's fair. I didn't even think about the two animated series. (which reminds me that I need to check out Rebels)
4395,2020-12-12 02:18:11,kavu8a,Do you like Doctor Strange because the Sorcerer Supreme is kind of like a Grand Wizard?
4396,2020-12-11 22:55:49,kavu8a,Harassing actors is not exclusive to the Marvel and Star Wars fandoms.
4397,2020-12-11 09:21:59,kavu8a,Avatar is still  theatrical vehicle.  Apparently James Cameron even has new projectors for theaters where they'll actually project in 3D so you don't even need glasses.
4398,2020-12-12 02:52:55,kavu8a,Never seen it
4399,2020-12-11 23:12:10,kavu8a,"Sure, i also shouldn't have used the qualifier ""most"", but i think it is fairly accurate to say that these big, nerdy spheres have a good amount of edgelords in them, though maybe edgelord might not be the perfect descriptor for what i have in mind.  
  
Being aware how big corporations work and where the general trend lies when it comes to the entertainment industry, well i don't think that's quite as out there tbh. As i said, big artists oftentimes share these sentiments because, well, it's true. (though tbf, the comment of the guy wasn't great, but it's in a reasonable thread and only added to that tbh)"
4400,2020-12-11 09:39:00,kavu8a,Yeah of course but they still spoke of plenty of theatrical content in that show. All the MCU movies are still theatrical only and coming to Disney+ only months later (like presumably Avatar sequels)
4401,2020-12-11 09:53:40,kavu8a,"I don't know the background of the event, but I'm assuming it was strictly related to Disney+ content.  All the stuff listed above are all Disney+ streaming content."
4402,2020-12-11 14:15:33,kavu8a,It wasn't strictly disney+ ( the event )
4403,2020-12-11 21:22:54,kavu8a,Gotcha.
4404,2020-12-11 07:01:10,kavrwz,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
4405,2020-12-11 05:52:40,kavrwz,Hooch is crazy
4406,2020-12-11 04:58:35,kavrwz,"Nothing on any of the ""old"" Netflix series has me sad...  Nice write up, though."

4423,2020-12-11 16:20:59,kavrwz,Any specific dates to go with this?
4424,2020-12-11 19:53:29,kavrwz,You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
4425,2020-12-12 01:10:08,kavrwz,"Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
4426,2020-12-11 05:18:44,kavrwz,"As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
4427,2020-12-11 08:21:15,kavrwz,So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
4428,2020-12-11 16:46:16,kavrwz,Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
4429,2020-12-11 17:11:28,kavrwz,Seems like Star Wars's future is on TV.

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"

4446,2020-12-11 14:47:15,kavrwz,"Yeah sounds like the Multiverse in SM3 will pull in Daredevil and Kingpin. Which could be great.

Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk, and there have been rumors that DNofrio has campaigned hard and they’ve taken him seriously as maybe using his character to put together the Sinister Six."
4447,2020-12-11 17:37:50,kavrwz,"There's a big hint in Hawkeye. Maya Lopez is a definitively Daredevil character (Echo, a deaf woman who can see something once and imitate it originally hired by Kingpin to take out Daredevil and eventually befriending him). She also wore the Ronin outfit for awhile that Hawkeye wore in Endgame after his family vanished (New Avengers comics).

4455,2020-12-11 16:21:20,kavrwz,Tim Roth will be back as Abomination and Mark Ruffalo.
4456,2020-12-12 02:56:32,kavrwz,Its a rather deceptive line if your not in the know.  WDAS is the movie studio. Disney Television Animation is the studio that typically handles the TV side (they were the ones that made the Tangled series).
4457,2020-12-11 13:35:16,kavrwz,That's not necessarily a bad thing tbh. It's how they execute it that matters. GOTG was kinda considered a bottom of the barrel IP for marvel before they made it and it turned out well.
4458,2020-12-11 23:07:07,kavrwz,"There’s like 70 announced shows here and less than 10 are actual original ideas. Really disappointing *in my opinion*.

I get people like Star Wars and stuff, but it seems extreme to me."
4459,2020-12-11 19:28:47,kavrwz,"I think it could be done. For me at least the fun part is the mind-bendy unreliable narrator stuff and not the graphic violence. Although there is something to be said for when other characters meet Moon Knight and are like, ""oh this guy is *crazy* crazy and not just *Batman* crazy."""
4460,2020-12-11 06:00:15,kavrwz,"This didn’t mention any of the Marvel movies since it’s still not certain whether they’ll be released in theaters first or on Disney+ at the same time, but The Eternals is set to have their first openly gay main character whenever that’s released.

If you haven’t watched the Disney+ short film Out, you absolutely should."
4461,2020-12-11 05:55:44,kavrwz,"Young Avengers is just over the horizon, and that comes with the most prominent gay couple in marvel. Still a few years out though."
4462,2020-12-11 15:23:22,kavrwz,Not sure if it is 100% confirmed but I remember seeing somewhere that Valkyrie is looking for a wife in the next Thor movie.

4464,2020-12-11 14:52:52,kavrwz,"I would bet it will be in a team, or they will reveal the character is gay in a sequel...that way people in China will already be invested.  Because you’re right....they want that China money badly. 


Wouldn’t it be a kick in the nuts to China if the wait until like Shang Chi 3 and reveal he was gay the whole time! Lmao. That could literally start a war!!"
4465,2020-12-21 17:11:41,kavrwz,I really don't like the sound of this. The whole point of the Ducks is that they are scrappy underdogs. Having them become what they played against feels kind of weird. And it's obviously gonna end with both Ducks teams playing against each other. It just sounds weird to me.
4466,2020-12-11 19:29:54,kavrwz,"I feel like this'll be a big part of the Ashoka show, considering that she was still searching when we see her in The Mandolorian."

4475,2020-12-11 13:53:27,kavrwz,"You are soo right. Marvel has been overdone, it's a stale medium at this point.  SW feels the same after the last 3 movies. Even Mando is aimless with no real main plotline.

It's so formulaic it isn't appealing.

Will smith movie,
Cars tv show, 
SW, SW, SW, SW, SW
Marvel movies or shows of all side movie characters, because why not saturate the market with bland superheros"
4476,2020-12-11 19:37:28,kavrwz,"Yeah. Did anyone really expect Disney to do something genuinely new? Aside from Pixar, which still has very niche content, I can't remember the last time Disney did an actually new story. 

It's one of the reasons this obsession people on here have with D+ ""killing"" Netflix is so silly."
4477,2020-12-11 14:10:10,kavrwz,Well original content in this context means content that is developed specificity for the platform and is owned by Disney
4478,2020-12-11 15:00:36,kavrwz,"
>Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk...

That doesn't excite me...  I don't see Daredevil remaining dark and gritty if placed in She-Hulk.  SH over the years has been more of a fun loving character."

They a announced it today, as well.

It actually appears on traditional broadcast television, anyone who can't see this **IS A SAVAGE AND AN IDIOT**.

Stoked about almost all of these, though."
4482,2020-12-11 14:08:01,kavrwz,Most of these projects are planned before the COVID
4483,2020-12-11 16:07:06,kavrwz,Different services provide different content. I dont see why that's only an issue when it's Disney. How much Oscar winning animated content do we see on HBO or Netflix?
4484,2020-12-12 02:30:02,kavrwz,Duh.  If you want Disney's adult content you mosey over to Hulu.  If you've been looking at the end of the year critics' lists you'll have noticed Disney is beating Netflix and Warnerbrothers decisively when it comes to critical acclaim.
4485,2020-12-12 00:55:57,kavrwz,Disney doesn’t give a fuck about that. They care about commercial success of which they aren’t matched.
4486,2020-12-11 19:53:58,kavrwz,The show is listed as a comedy. Not sure how Charlie's Matt Murdock would fit into that.
4487,2020-12-11 14:50:52,kavrwz,"I get it. But AntMan seemed really dumb to me. So did Thor at the time, and GotG is when I thought they had given up. 

I think the Series will be used to set up bigger events in the movies.  Almost like a Rogue One to Star Wars.  

That way people who want more background will have it, and yet you don’t HAVE to have seen it to follow the movies.  

Also Ironheart, Kate Bishop, Ms Marvel and I’m betting a Young Loki will get set up for a Secret Avengers movie."
4488,2020-12-11 14:40:54,kavrwz,"Armor Wars is widely considered one of the best, if not the best period, Iron Man stories.

We’ll most likely see Justin Hammer return and the intro of some other big Iron Man villains like Crimson Dynamo.

I wouldn’t call it bottom of the barrel. The only difference is that War Machine will he finally getting the spotlight rather than Iron Man"
4489,2020-12-11 14:57:18,kavrwz,"Well, you have to remember, when they first started making Marvel movies, Iron Man was a very odd choice in how to begin."
4490,2020-12-11 17:12:16,kavrwz,Yes.  Can they only make outer space/superhero stuff?  That’s not the only genre.

4497,2020-12-08 06:28:38,k8ykqx,"Ah, this is exactly my niche interest (names and diving too deep into fundie families lol). I really think someone will need to work hard to beat Spurgeon as the worst name of the third generation, poor kid. But I have a particular dislike of Alyssa Bates’s “cutesy” theme too (though I like the name Maci). 

Of all the “namers” listed here, I like Jinger and Jeremy’s choices the best for their two daughters Perhaps making up for the fact that she was named “Jinger” in the family naming trend before her parents got around to using (real) names such as Joy or Jennifer?"

4500,2020-12-08 11:15:38,k8ykqx,What really annoys me about the Duggar names is that Joy-Anna and Johanna are basically the same name. I know they have a lot of kids but it’s not like they’ve used every J name on the planet. Call one of them Julie or Jemma or something!

4508,2020-12-08 15:03:57,k8ykqx,"Fundies are really fond of the names Hosannah and Jubilee (which, IMO, are not human names). I can understand the overuse of names like Joy, Grace, Faith and Hope among this crowd. However, I'm also noticing a lot of shoutouts to Judaism (Israel, Shalom, Jerusalem, Bethlehem). As a Jewish person, it would never occur to me to name my child something that references a religion I don't practice."
4509,2020-12-08 10:11:34,k8ykqx,Priscilla is on there several times despite being a very old fashioned English name. It’s an interesting choice because it’s not as directly biblical to most people the way Samuel and David are.

Like, if they decided that they didn't want a Jim Bob Jr. so far down the line I guess that's understandable, but then why even use James?"

4537,2020-12-08 14:24:48,k8ykqx,And for the second time. Especially since it's extremely dangerous for Mama Caldwell to be pregnant at all.
4538,2020-12-08 14:18:10,k8ykqx,"This happened to my great-grandmother! She had my grandfather when she was like 19 and her mother was pregnant at the same time and went on to have at least one other child after that. My grandfather was an only child, but had several aunts right around his age..."
4539,2020-12-08 15:19:33,k8ykqx,TWICE!
4540,2020-12-08 14:37:25,k8ykqx,i think i read somewhere she wanted a K theme but they also didn’t want to break tradition so they named him that but call him the K name to match ??
4541,2020-12-08 15:03:51,k8ykqx,I believe she’s said it’s supposedly a nickname meaning “the fourth” although I’ve never heard it used by anyone else. I can see the similarity to the word “quad” though. I guess it’s similar to the nickname Trey for the third.
4542,2020-12-08 14:49:16,k8ykqx,"Addallee is the worst for me on spelling alone, so many double letters. Warden is definitely up there though."
4543,2020-12-08 15:24:07,k8ykqx,"To be fair, at least three of those are place names that are relevant to the religion they do practice. Not to say that using place names for people isn’t odd, but Austin, Dallas, and Dakota are at least semi-“normal” names."
4544,2020-12-08 15:21:15,k8ykqx,"I noticed that Renee also makes several appearances, thought that was interesting."
4545,2020-12-08 20:17:41,k8ykqx,I noticed that the oldest son’s middle name is James too! Were they truly hurting for J-names for boys at the point regular old James came along?
4546,2020-12-08 17:34:40,k8ykqx,It makes me think of sperm and semen and splooge
4547,2020-12-09 03:32:14,k8ykqx,"This may be the first time on reddit that someone used the phrase ""unpopular opinion"" accurately"
4548,2020-12-08 15:20:44,k8ykqx,As you should.
4549,2020-12-17 16:58:46,k8ykqx,"I don’t hate the name either. 
For a kid it’s kinda strange.  But as an adult I feel like it will be fine."
4550,2020-12-08 05:52:31,k8ykqx,I'm on my phone which is formatting properly so I apologize for anything I can't see!
4551,2020-12-08 17:58:32,k8ykqx,a life of misery for which you are never allowed to be angry
4552,2020-12-08 15:18:46,k8ykqx,"Don’t forget there’s a kid in a family not listed here (I forget which one) named Heistheway, and the whole mess of Karissa Collins’s kids!"
4553,2020-12-09 02:45:02,k8ykqx,Oh god I skimmed past that one. It’s definitely the worst.
4554,2020-12-08 18:22:06,k8ykqx,"It's pronounced ah-GAH-pay, if that helps."
4555,2020-12-09 02:44:33,k8ykqx,"Ugh I didn’t realize that, I like it less now 😒 lol"
4556,2020-12-09 02:43:46,k8ykqx,Poetic.
4557,2020-12-08 13:13:47,k8ykqx,"To be fair, G-d told her the names, and spellings. :x"
4558,2021-01-25 02:35:38,k8ykqx,And Aynjel is the only non “An” ... like wtf man.
4559,2020-12-08 15:03:45,k8ykqx,All I see is “Adderall”
4560,2020-12-08 15:20:30,k8ykqx,Wasn’t it that Jim Bob had a girlfriend named Julie and that’s why it was off limits?
4561,2020-12-08 15:09:14,k8ykqx,They call her Hannie and Joy-Annie just gets shortened to Joy. (Also I think Jana fits into this group too)
4562,2020-12-08 16:28:58,k8ykqx,"My grandma was pregnant a year after my mom had her first child. They were 41 and 20 respectively. We always joke that my mom's younger half brother was born an uncle. He was born a year and 4 days after my older sister. Sadly my grandma got pregnant because she was jealous of my mom. My mom ended up doing a lot of the childcare for her brother, and one time when he was little he told my grandma ""Danae should be my mom not you!"""
4563,2020-12-08 15:06:29,k8ykqx,"Ahh... so strange though! So many questions: why have a letter theme at all? Why not use a different letter since he was the first born (R, E)? Is Kade a totally random name or does it somehow tie to his legal name?"
4564,2020-12-08 16:13:00,k8ykqx,"Quatre to Quad to Cade to Kade, I guess"
4565,2020-12-08 16:12:38,k8ykqx,"Fair enough! As I said, I'm Jewish so I associate those places with Judaism (except for Bethlehem)."
4566,2020-12-08 15:58:34,k8ykqx,Yeah the Collins family has some interesting ones...
4567,2020-12-08 15:23:11,k8ykqx,I love Ivy.
4568,2020-12-08 14:09:50,k8ykqx,Proof of their delusions omg
4569,2020-12-08 16:05:26,k8ykqx,"Possibly, but I'm not 100% sure if Julie was an ex girlfriend. He didn't have much time to date others before meeting Michelle since they married when he was 19."
4570,2020-12-09 02:44:53,k8ykqx,"Yeah, Jana, Joy-Anna and Johanna. Very very similar. 


I know a family with a Gemma and a Gianna, which I think are too similar for a sibset, but maybe I'm too judgy, because I'm currently seriously considering naming the bub we're expecting Heidi, when we already have an Ivy...."
4571,2020-12-08 14:56:54,k8ykqx,"She really is... um, at least in need of some medical help. Most of us fear for her and the kids safety, but that's not for this sub, but, YIKE."
4572,2020-12-08 17:52:14,k8ykqx,the voices in her head also told her to give birth in a Target (or Walmart ?) and have  an unassisted homebirth . As in no midwife or any help .

4574,2020-12-08 02:24:25,k8te2d,Hello! I’m interested in the Milestone lot. Would you do $25 for it?
4575,2020-12-08 13:30:30,k8te2d,Hey I'm really sorry and I apologize. Those sold on eBay over the weekend. I thought I deleted that line from the post.  I think I took a best offer of $25 so I would have definitely sold them to you for that price.
4576,2020-12-08 13:31:56,k8te2d,No worries! Thanks for the heads up!
4577,2020-12-08 00:27:20,k8sp5i,"i love all of these!!  “she” is my favorite song ever & i also love keara graves!!! i haven’t known anyone that knows of her so that’s so exciting to me- also, i guess i kinda started a trend on accident??? so if you don’t mind, could you credit me for this idea? 🥺"
4578,2020-12-08 13:42:17,k8sp5i,"Once again, I am \*definitely\* am not saving this post, aswell."
4579,2020-12-08 00:40:39,k8sp5i,"Keara Graves is deeply underrated. Why people are sleeping on the chick who literally goes out of her way to make sapphic covers of popular music, I have no idea

And sure, it kind of reminds me of how people share their end-of-the-year Spotify stats that show off their most-played songs, artists, and genres. Only I can actually participate in this one :D"
4580,2020-12-08 00:51:15,k8sp5i,"yes, and she’s made some really cute short films within the last few years!!!! her & georgia convinced me to start watching youtubers.  thank you so much for listening to me + i 100% get that 💖"
4581,2020-12-07 20:30:04,k8nnyo,"Willow doing it would be hilarious to me and so out of character. I wonder what could push her to do it. Maybe her and Michael do it together... Marital bonding. 

It's been a hot minute since Carly's been in legitimate, could go to jail, trouble. Plus, spoilers/a leak say that something's gonna happen to Sonny. If she's pushed just enough and doesn't have anyone (read: a combination of one of her children, I personally say Joss because why not and Jason) stopping her, she could kill Julian."
4582,2020-12-07 20:36:07,k8nnyo,Don’t let it be Brando. I’m upset enough they pulled him into the mob stories and killed Dev.
4583,2020-12-08 01:33:42,k8nnyo,"Jason is the obvious killer but it usually turns out to be a less popular, less screen time actor so I'm going with Harmony, cause Julian hurt Willow and Wiley."
4584,2020-12-09 19:51:58,k8nnyo,"I want it to be Micheal.    He was more interesting when he was killing people.    Or maybe a returning Morgan.     That would be some cliffhanger shit.    You see a man in a hoodie shoot Julian and then he removes the hoodie and it’s Morgan.    He calls someone freaked out, AJ picks up the phone.    We go to Christmas break.    Everyone’s like wtf."
4585,2020-12-09 04:07:49,k8nnyo,Willow does it and Chase covers it up which leads to them doing more shoddy stuff.
4586,2020-12-07 23:22:42,k8nnyo,"I would LOVE it to be Willow. She's so dull, make her do something interesting!"
4587,2020-12-07 22:15:08,k8nnyo,Source for the spoilers?
4588,2020-12-07 22:18:37,k8nnyo,I missed a few episodes and didn’t see his start to working with Cyrus so I had assumed it was as a mole for Sonny. Is it legit?
4589,2020-12-07 22:18:45,k8nnyo,"I think I saw it on Soap Opera Central or something like that, I can't remember off the top of my head exactly"
4590,2020-12-08 03:27:19,k8nnyo,He's a mole for Sonny. But his random appearance at the shootout is still suspect to me. He could be playing both sides against the other

I recently went through something really hard and Anna from Frozen and Ellie from Up were characters I thought of when I processed my emotions.

I'm pretty new to enneagram, and I'll be honest I don't actually know most of these characters, but can someone please explain why Elsa is 1w9? Is it because she fears her powers taking over her and then becoming bad?"

4763,2021-02-05 23:06:16,k6jv87,I don't think the beast is a 4x3. More of an 8. I would say. Of course he is depressive that's maybe why he seems to be a little bit 4ish but I don't think he is a 4.
4764,2021-02-06 01:33:57,k6jv87,Forte is more a 4x3 than a 3x2 that's not matching at all I would say
4765,2021-02-06 17:44:37,k6jv87,Elsa is never a 1 don't know why everyone always thinks that. She is a 6 for sure. All she wants is security for herself and for others. Always afraid..

4771,2020-12-04 20:36:30,k6jv87,I agree! I think she could align with either wing.
4772,2020-12-04 17:58:58,k6jv87,"Yes, so perfect!"
4773,2020-12-04 18:29:10,k6jv87,The 9w1 I most identify with is Sleepy. Then Kronk after that. Then probably Anita from 101 Dalmatians b/c I also would be totally chill with having 101 dogs.
4774,2020-12-04 16:44:53,k6jv87,I claim Anna but definitely agree with Ellie lol

4780,2020-12-04 16:06:28,k6jv87,Let's do it 4's!!

4783,2020-12-04 17:02:46,k6jv87,Maybe you’re more of an 8wing than you think ;) For a while I felt torn between the 8 and 6 wing—ESPECIALLY as a woman. There’s not a lot of women represented in 8’s energy. I definitely feel like I have aspects of both or both wings are present but in different situations/relationship dynamics. This description really helped me see that I’m an 8 wing for reasons I think Anna is too: https://enneagrampaths.com/2020/07/17/enneagram-types-7w6-vs-7w8/
4784,2020-12-04 17:14:52,k6jv87,"Sure thing! And I’ll preface sharing it with I don’t want to invalidate anyone’s ability to relate to Elsa. Relatability is an important part of fiction and there’s only so much we look at. But here is the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Enneagram/comments/e0exfq/elsa_from_frozen/fa675ub/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) I wrote a long time ago. I’d edit a few things now and I’ve mentally added more just discussing with friends, but I don’t want this to be obnoxious. 😆 It was a rabbit hole I went down for a while because 5 women are intriguing to me and I think hard for others to understand/identify sometimes."
4785,2020-12-04 15:33:16,k6jv87,"It’s when we know we’re onto something. It doesn’t mean we’re necessarily right (by any means!), but the passion is usually a matter of interest plus the build-up of so much observation and info that it ends in the “how in the world do I explain all this to other people” feeling."
4786,2020-12-04 19:12:55,k6jv87,I’m also 9w1 with ADHD
4787,2020-12-05 04:56:56,k6jv87,"It seems there are others that feel that way too and we can agree to disagree. 🤷🏻‍♀️I don’t see the 1 character arc for her at all (I mean, I see what is being explained, but I don’t see that in the movies). Overall, I don’t see the personality comparison to 1s and it seems to dismiss a lot of details about her and her motivations. Again, I’m not here to tell people they can’t relate to her or have a different opinion, but I just disagree."
4788,2020-12-04 21:42:06,k6jv87,"Look at you, challenging my comment ;) I'm pretty firm in my 6 wing haha"
4789,2020-12-04 19:12:48,k6jv87,"Sweet of you to worry about invalidating others feelings on the character, but I think you'd have a hard time doing this unless you made it personal somehow. 😊 I like talking and hearing others perspectives on fictional characters enneagram types whether we agree or disagree because if we both relate to a character, it offers a point of understanding to other type structures without being directly vulnerable. I think there's something beautiful about that. 

So... thanks for sending! I liked your post, it definitely argued well that Elsa isn't a 9 (I agree, so much so I'd question the 9 wing) and highlighted those points above, but a lot of your arguments for 5 seem true of all competency group members that suppress emotions to an extent and tend towards usefulness, and so I related to it all too, as a 1.  I won't get into specifics unless you want me to, but if you have more 1v5 things I'd be interested!

I actually think -and I dont say this lightly- Elsa's character arc between the 2 movies is perhaps the best type-1 self-realization story in popular fiction. I've felt this way for a while - ""let it go"" is my go-to song for making a mistake and disintegrating to 4 and I cry tears of joy when I hear ""show yourself"" and feel like I can actually be myself without hurting everyone. If I'm being honest, I doubt you could really convince me she's a 5, but I do like hearing where the relatability is either way and try to keep an open mind. I definitely don't want to invalidate your connection or passion with the character either. 

I actually am now inspired to write a post about why her story is the perfect 1 story arc, to me (I'd write now but I wanna give it more thought, its like a journaling exercise to share) If you're interested stay tuned and feel free to tear into it or share unrecognized 5ness within it 😊"
4790,2020-12-04 15:37:49,k6jv87,"Ooh I love that explanation and I can totally relate.  It makes me think of how I got into meditation.  I had just read so many studies that had that positive results on meditation or mindfulness techniques that I just had to try it.  I’ve loved it ever since.

Also I think I get the explaining part.  My favorite way to teach complex ideas is with analogies.  I think a good analogy is the best bridge to meet someone where they’re at."
4791,2020-12-04 22:16:45,k6jv87,Didn’t you challenged mine first?
4792,2020-12-04 20:35:31,k6jv87,"Ahhh I see. Well, I don’t like to push onto posts where someone feels so strongly about something that there’s not really a chance of changing that opinion. Which I don’t think you meant negatively, but posting is a great thought exercise and I don’t want to rain on that. (Edit: But I’m sure I will enjoy reading it—I haven’t heard directly from 1’s feelings about how they go to a growth space).

That’s tricky because I can see what you’re saying from a 1 perspective. Since 1s go to 7 in growth and 5s go to 7 in stress, I can see some overlap perspective there. The growth of Elsa that I focused on was her willingness to start being vulnerable (with Anna), expand her inner circle (to include Anna not just herself), step into leadership (assert herself in general), make decisions (instead of shutting down/shutting out) and tap into her gut feelings instead of just her head as she especially does during the second movie. These are all specific changes she has to make for growth and it’s very 5–>8 in strength to me. 

Let it Go is a really, really touching scene for a lot of people! The emotional aspect of it is relatable. To me, the way she handles it, that was needed self-discovery, but her motivations were fear and withdrawal and she goes chaotic (like 7 stress for us). So it’s not a health/growth experience. She’s not handling things productively at that point. Throughout the movies, I see her stepping up in 8 strength more than continuing to live in that “let it go” or a 7 space.

I never really considered her being a 1 because I think she’s strongly in the fear triad. Not just because of circumstances and her past, but because it’s core to her personality and motivation. She verbally and nonverbally references fear a lot; she’s either withdrawing/pulling away out of fear or running towards something to face a fear. And I don’t see patterns of that with anger at all as a reactive or core emotion for her. 

I, too, cry hard during Show Yourself. That we can at least agree on—it has a very 4 vibe!"
4793,2020-12-04 17:24:42,k6jv87,"Yes! Analogies are very helpful. I think with 5s, it’s a problem of accumulation. One of our biggest strengths is observation and we live in our head so our minds are just constantly connecting data points. When we get interested in something, we dive into it more and it can be very, very hard to retrace all of those thought trees and explain it to others sometimes. And then we circle back to things because we’re constantly remembering important details. It always feels like trying to cram a dissertation into a few paragraphs, so we’re very happy when others try to understand!"
4794,2020-12-04 21:37:48,k6jv87,"You're not wrong about any of this - she is fearful, she isn't reactive, she doesn't trust her gut, and she has to get past it. And I can see and appreciate the 5 there definitely, because on an enneagram growth structure level, you struggle with this the most. But, every type let's some type of fear get in the way of following their gut-- ie, their truest selves. Its the sorta bigger picture beyond that that defines type. The gut triad doesn't do this less, they're just more aware of their gut reactions and their ""truth""... such that the fear seems like more of an obstacle we are possibly unaware of than a state of being. It doesn't mean it makes it easier to follow it just because we ""know"".  In fact, it's incredibly difficult feeling like we know things that make no rational sense. The entire 1 struggle is one of rationalizing -overthinking- doing what we feel we should. We literally stop trusting life and ourselves and follow our critic, a head space, convincing ourselves we are following objective logic because we discount everything that makes us us. 

But... there's subtleties beyond the above that make me feel it's 1 rather than 5, because from above it could easily be either which is actually really cool.   So this needs a more emotional analysis. And certainly with the right logic or emotional depth-and if there exists sufficient evidence to suggest I am wrong- you COULD change my mind, but you'd likely have to bring in some pretty deep insight into the core fear 5 issues -like, more vulnerability than I've ever seen from a 5 or most 5 literature - to do so. I would love to see you do that even if you dont share. But, I think in this case it would be pretty hard with rationalized logic to convince me because there is too much my own subjective experience being rationalized with type structure, like I could take your entire argument above and replace the numbers and tweak a few words to argue 1 and it would end up making your entire argument above make more sense to me but less sense to you. But certainly I would enjoy you perturbing my certainty, so don't hesitate ;) ill let ya know when I post it!"
4795,2020-12-04 19:05:51,k6jv87,I feel like you’ve described living with ADHD.  Lol
4796,2020-12-04 22:14:45,k6jv87,"Hmmm. I can see we’re not going to have a very productive conversation. Because it sounds like you’re saying, that because you have such a subjective attachment to it, you’re not going to be able to agree with other rationalities. Maybe I misunderstood the second part, but that was confusing and seems like you’re trying to strong arm me because you really, really believe you are “right” and I don’t sense open mindedness.

I disagree that you can take the points I said and switch the numbers 1 and 5. That sounds like some fundamental misunderstanding of 5s. Your first paragraph is something I’ve considered before, every type does deal with those issues, but to me, that is not a sufficient argument to explain Elsa’s big picture and little picture behavior which is always tied to fear. That’s why I was explaining it from a motivational standpoint that is a theme/pattern for her whole storyline (and without enough anger or shame—especially anger—to center her in another triad). 

I wasn’t using logic, actually, just an all around assessment of her as a character."
4797,2020-12-04 23:01:48,k6jv87,"I'm sorry if my vagueness is upsetting, I'm really not meaning to strong arm you, I'm trying to be upfront that I am not prepared to have rational debate about it because of my own bias rather than insisting I am right indirectly. But I would like to, once I've put my perspective into words because I haven't given you my side of the argument ie my ""big picture"" which I see as different from your big picture development takeaway all together. 

Anyway, sorry about that. I probably should have kept it to myself."

Kind of on a similar topic, Maybe it’s just because I was too young but I don’t remember Will older kid being pushed so much on audiences - not sure what that means for this whole thing though"
4893,2020-11-30 02:49:20,k3dcuf,will had a model volume of fame in the 80s. and in 1990 his popularity became huge because of the fresh prince of belair.  Tupac was only famous in the rap industry where in will was famous in both the rap industry and Hollywood
4894,2020-11-30 11:45:38,k3dcuf,not an asshole and them not talking about trey isn't news worthy information.  maybe trey doesn't want them to talk about him
4895,2020-11-30 03:48:46,k3dcuf,Well that's your personal opinion As far as intelligence and art Tupac has my 100.
4896,2020-11-30 11:55:37,k3dcuf,"its not just an opinion its a fact. Tupac was only known in the rap community and Will was known in both the Rap community and Hollywood. this is a fact. he was also making more money then Tupac. when tupac died he was worth a few hundred thousand dollars. 
by the time Will smith made the Fresh Prince of Bel Air he had already made millions of dollars. in fact he made enough money that before making the fresh prince he had owed 2.8 million in back taxes. and had to return most of his purchased items.. after making the fresh prince he had to fork over around 70% of his first 3 years of salary
to pay the IRS back"
4897,2020-11-30 14:57:10,k3dcuf,Once again your personal opinion on who's better !!!
4898,2020-11-30 15:54:08,k3dcuf,its not an opinion on whose better.  its a fact of who was more popular. its an irrefutable fact that will smith was more popular. hense the reason he made enough money to owe 2.8 million in back taxes. and tupac was only worth a few hundred thousand.
4899,2020-11-30 15:55:01,k3dcuf,Bahahaha nah
4900,2020-11-30 15:58:55,k3dcuf,your an idiot. i don't see how you can't understand that tupac wasn't as well known. this is a fact. when one person is only known in the rap community but the other is known in both the rap community as well as Hollywood then the person known in both is more famous. not to mention will was a millionaire from rap alone

wonder if any songs off WLR will chart next week (my guess is not, mayyybe the song with cudi).    
also feel like that meg/dababy song is gonna be a slow climber but eventually reach top 30"
4951,2020-12-29 23:45:27,kmo7u2,I kinda like how the xmss songs takeover the charts. It cleans the sheet for the new year.

Artists are going to quit dropping music in December so they don't have to compete with Christmas music"
4955,2020-12-30 02:22:54,kmo7u2,they should really do something about the christmas songs on the charts in this new streaming era. when Mariah Carey went number 1 last year on a 25 year old song it was kinda cute but having the whole top 10 being dominated by christmas songs is tiring
4956,2020-12-30 00:26:22,kmo7u2,I don’t think this is the week of January 02 right?
4957,2020-12-30 05:26:09,kmo7u2,The fact that Christmas in Hollis can't get on this list during Christmas time infuriates me. Let's get some good Christmas music on this list

4968,2020-12-30 13:46:01,kmo7u2,it is. charts are counted week ahead
4969,2020-12-30 02:18:19,kmo7u2,Not necessarily. People just associate it with the holidays. A lot of people are definitely just letting Spotify playlists run the music
4970,2020-12-30 03:07:01,kmo7u2,"Nah man, for me it's just a warm cozy vibe to have Christmas music playing when it's cold outside and I'm at work. Perfect background music for this time of year."
4971,2020-12-30 17:55:23,kmo7u2,"It’s not really a religious thing, christmas is very secularized in America."
4972,2020-12-30 17:12:58,kmo7u2,Christmastime gives many people a feeling that I would say is comparable to nostalgia. Listening to the music helps people get into that feeling. Plus tradition
4973,2020-12-30 07:54:27,kmo7u2,I think Slayer doing better than the kanye song
4974,2020-12-30 06:05:35,kmo7u2,what marketing? it’s literally almost driven by hype generated by carti fans and blogs. no real singles prior to it. it’s just carti posting shit
4975,2020-12-30 00:22:46,kmo7u2,Well I mean the album was terrible
4976,2020-12-30 06:11:10,kmo7u2,Yeah I’m equal parts nervous and excited about my single life. It’s just the uncertainty that gets to me sometimes although I’m sure I’ll be fine. Thanks bro
4977,2020-12-30 02:30:12,kmo7u2,Ah ok makes sense
4978,2020-12-30 16:24:34,kmo7u2,also don't underestimate how many people are using this for their businesses

4982,2020-12-30 06:11:48,kmo7u2,no worries man. you got this!
4983,2020-12-31 01:06:28,kmo7u2,like there's basically another holiday on top of it with Santa and presents that even non-Christians practice and tell their kids abt
4984,2020-12-30 04:48:13,kmo7u2,The beginning sucks and nobody is going to listen to the rest of the album if they get a bad first impression.
4985,2020-12-30 04:11:42,kmo7u2,Not even close it’s a 4 at best lmao
4986,2020-12-30 05:03:05,kmo7u2,"i completely understand but that's why I'm saying this, ppl listened to the first half and turned it off"
4987,2020-12-30 10:08:57,kmo7u2,Best part of the album is beginning and Album is great
4988,2020-12-30 05:03:59,kmo7u2,idk how you can listen to the second half and think most of those songs arent good (assuming youre a carti fan)
4989,2020-12-30 04:57:26,kmo7u2,"As an overall tape yes.

But there's still a few songs that are prime Carti"

**Buyers and sellers, use the link above to verify where to redeem codes to ensure 4K codes redeem properly.**

**Feedback Logging (*Does not apply to GIVEAWAYS*)**

* Once a transaction has been completed, one user (buyer or seller) must create a comment (can be in-line with the deal discussion) tagging both [u/DCSbot](https://www.reddit.com/u/DCSbot) and the user they transacted with, for example  u\/IamtheZZ.
 * The u/ is required, and the username for the bot ***MUST BE TYPED NOT COPY/PASTED*** to work properly.
* Once this is done, the tagged user must respond to that comment for feedback to be logged.
* If successful, the bot will respond to the second comment with ""Added"", and the number will increment for both.

All discussions/negotiations about a potential transaction must be made via comments. Exchange codes/payment via PM or Reddit Chat. This helps to prevent scams and track trusted buyers and sellers.  **DO NOT RESPOND TO OFFERS MADE VIA PM OR CHAT.**

This post was originally made by IamtheZZ as a reference in case they ever delete this post.

Always fun to check out these lists and especially see how readers' opinions or reader demographics change over time. I wish Nexus had made an appearance this time around, but I'll have to check out some of the newer runs (especially Giant Days and Squirrel Girl - I've sampled each run and enjoyed what I read, but maybe it's time to bump them up the reading list priority table!)

Also, it's wild to me how Cerebus's reputation has diminished so much over the years. I feel like even in 2008, Sim was a well-known loony, but the work was still familiar and good enough to crack the top 25. Now it barely scratches the top 100."

5161,2020-12-24 05:52:56,kj5skf,"The one that gets me is Walking Dead going from 28 to 60 to 96. It's less old and doesn't come with the same baggage that Cerebus does, but it still dropped a LOT."
5162,2020-12-24 04:21:32,kj5skf,"It’s a reader voting poll.

Also, Ryan North’s Squirrel Girl really isn’t that bad and the amount of vitriol it gets continues to be ridiculous."
5163,2020-12-24 15:12:31,kj5skf,"The top five are, I think, pretty baked in and not likely to change, but the rest rotate a bit. I think Prophet had some recency bias going for it as I had *just* read it and was blown away, but now some time has passed I might switch it for something like Will Eisner’s The Spirit or Hitman by Garth Ennis. I also regret not putting Hickman’s East of West in there and might consider switching Journey Into Mystery with it."
5164,2020-12-23 21:09:37,kj0tlu,"i think the bigger headline here is taylor blocking mariah carey from #1 on THE WEEK OF CHRISMAS! that's fucking insane

also cudi's top 2 charting tracks being non-features is cool"
5165,2020-12-23 23:25:23,kj0tlu,why aren't these thread as popular as they used to be?
5166,2020-12-23 21:34:05,kj0tlu,"That jump for folklore is INSANE, I wonder if she did a discounted deal or something. 

Cudi debuted a lot more than I thought he would on the top 100."
5167,2020-12-23 22:30:23,kj0tlu,Damn woulda loved to see Cudi get his first number 1. Still great numbers considering how his last few albums did.
5168,2020-12-23 22:24:20,kj0tlu,"Would've been so wholesome if Cudi hit No.1.

smh Taylor didn't need to hit us w two albums this year"
5169,2020-12-23 22:30:53,kj0tlu,"I love Cudi so much and I wanted him so badly to hit #1 but credit where credit is due, there was no chance he was gonna beat Taylor

I actually liked Evermore a decent bit, anyone else dig it? I liked folklore as well but this was better for me"
5170,2020-12-24 16:56:08,kj0tlu,Michael Buble really going to do numbers every December for another decade at least huh
5171,2020-12-24 00:02:42,kj0tlu,Look at the difference in pure sales between the pop and hip hop albums. No wonder. Pop fans buy copies like their life depends on it and we just bump it and if we ride with it we bump it more and if we REALLY love it only then we'll buy a full copy and if we don't feel it after the first listen we never stream it again lmao
5172,2020-12-24 16:36:21,kj0tlu,Have y'all istened to the Taylor Swift tape? How is it
5173,2020-12-24 02:01:01,kj0tlu,Taylor always keeping black artists down smh
5174,2020-12-23 21:58:03,kj0tlu,BUT CUDI ALBUM WAS ONE OF THE BEST OF ALL TIME
5175,2020-12-24 03:46:08,kj0tlu,Eminent not even charting ? Will his be next week or was it cause he stopped a bit late
5176,2020-12-24 00:44:30,kj0tlu,"Anyone else find it curious how pop albums like Taylor Swift Etc. always have so many physical sales, while Rap/Hip Hop sales are almost entirely streaming? I wonder if older listeners generally buy albums while younger listeners stream, but it is definitely an interesting sales trend"
5177,2020-12-23 21:37:11,kj0tlu,"Nah, Christmas week charts won’t be until next week"
5178,2020-12-23 22:59:24,kj0tlu,"Honestly, I think everyone I've seen (me included) is unenthusiastic about Mariah going #1. It was cool last year because it never had before, but this year it was just gonna be annoying. The only people who are happy about her going #1 are her stans."
5179,2020-12-23 22:31:55,kj0tlu,Definitely a huge headline but I was keeping it hip hop related
5180,2020-12-24 03:09:14,kj0tlu,Christmas week counts next week and Christmas Day is counted in two weeks
5181,2020-12-23 23:30:41,kj0tlu,"I used to see them all the time on the front page, now i have to seek them out,its weird."
5182,2020-12-24 00:48:30,kj0tlu,"Idk how to explain it properly, but I think the pandemic might have lowkey affected the interest of these posts.

Also, like the other dude said, music has been dry af this year."
5183,2020-12-24 02:29:35,kj0tlu,"Mainstream stuff feels stale rn idk, ive personally been digging through older or new niche stuff because im just not into the popping music right now."
5184,2020-12-24 02:23:36,kj0tlu,Not sure but I might throw up a bot that notifies people when the billboard thread comes out every week if that's something people would be interested in
5185,2020-12-24 00:26:27,kj0tlu,music is dry af right now
5186,2020-12-24 04:15:22,kj0tlu,i usually like looking at billboard and stuff but at some pt it got old to me esp w the merch bundles/artificial number 1s
5187,2020-12-24 04:58:34,kj0tlu,R/hhh in general gets upset when numbers are brought up because artists like Freddie Gibbs do terrible on the charts.
5188,2020-12-24 02:24:43,kj0tlu,No discount as far as I’m aware (I bought merch from her site last week)
5189,2020-12-23 22:55:25,kj0tlu,I feel like back in the day big artists could scheme to get a #1 album but now it's basically impossible. Taylor just drops a huge album out of nowhere and pretty much no one can compete with her numbers.
5190,2020-12-24 01:18:06,kj0tlu,"Sad bois got Cudi, let the hoes have Taylor."
5191,2020-12-24 06:24:14,kj0tlu,yes she did
5192,2020-12-23 23:26:55,kj0tlu,"i honestly liked folklore a lot better, evermore kinda felt like folklore leftovers with less inspiration"
5193,2020-12-24 00:55:30,kj0tlu,I liked folklore a bit more but Evermore is great. Ivy and Cowboy like me are probably my two favorites. Both in my top 10 albums this year and I wasn’t  a Taylor fan until now
5194,2021-03-11 15:38:58,kj0tlu,folklore and evermore are amazing - definitely among the best albums of 2020.
5195,2020-12-24 04:16:38,kj0tlu,i just dont understand the point of buying a digital copy in 2020. you're just flushing money down the toilet to put more money in the pockets of a millionaire
5196,2020-12-24 04:51:46,kj0tlu,there are songs i listen to on release day or whatever then a couple months later i'll do a re-listen an there's songs I'll end up putting in my rotation that i disregarded before or felt i didn't like.
5197,2020-12-24 04:52:34,kj0tlu,next week. probably looking at number 3 cause Taylor sales are strong and paul McCartney dropped.
5198,2020-12-24 01:24:10,kj0tlu,"It's more to due with Taylor having devoted fans, same with Eminem or BTS."
5199,2020-12-24 01:04:34,kj0tlu,Taylor fans are probably of the same age as many hip hop listeners. She’s been around for a long time.
5200,2020-12-24 02:00:30,kj0tlu,until billboard changes the rules it is going to be a yearly thing.
5201,2020-12-23 23:34:40,kj0tlu,I used to love the discussion
5202,2020-12-24 17:34:48,kj0tlu,"I just found this on the front page, so things are back to normal."
5203,2020-12-24 05:35:47,kj0tlu,"Do it. I love these threads and think there's potential for them to get a lot more traffic. But as people are saying, I've barely seen them for a few months whereas they used to always be in Popular"
5204,2020-12-23 23:48:53,kj0tlu,I wouldn’t say nobody. Adele or Drake would put up a hell of a fight.
5205,2020-12-24 01:47:58,kj0tlu,Folklore felt more focused but evermore felt more interesting and varied. Honestly liked the later a lot more
5206,2020-12-24 17:52:07,kj0tlu,its so their favs go #1 so they can shitpost about it on stan twitter. legit
5207,2020-12-27 07:18:36,kj0tlu,It's still a great choice for people who live or often stay in places with bad internet.
5208,2020-12-24 18:02:23,kj0tlu,Yeah sucks his #1 streak will not continue but dropping during Taylor and Paul won’t work now
5209,2020-12-24 03:34:29,kj0tlu,"Great point, but I guess then I am curious why it seems that pop artists have way more devoted fans generally than hip hop artists."
5210,2020-12-24 10:48:55,kj0tlu,"I defo think it's an age thing too. I guarantee artists like Ariana/Drake/Uzi/Lil Baby have way more fans under 21 than Taylor does these days and they don't buy, they stream instead"
5211,2020-12-24 01:09:26,kj0tlu,"Yeah I would guess that there are a lot more Taylor Swift listeners above the age of 25 than Kid Cudi or Jack Harlow for instance.

I mean another example is while Carrie Underwood and Pop Smoke had about the same amount of weekly sales, Carrie had 25k physical sales and Pop Smoke had 300.

My guess is that people above the age of 25-30 or so generally just buy albums instead of streaming them, and pop has much more older listeners than hip hop."
5212,2020-12-24 02:19:27,kj0tlu,What rules are you talking about? The rule where christmas exists?
5213,2020-12-24 02:14:40,kj0tlu,To what though?
5214,2020-12-23 23:54:30,kj0tlu,Drake and Adele would 100 percent outsell taylor now that there are no physical bundles counting.  Scorpion sold 744k without any physical bundles and 25 sold 3 million (lmao) before physical bundles even became the norm
5215,2020-12-24 19:10:42,kj0tlu,"Does it really count? It’s not a whole new album, it’s just a B side of a current album. (Although I’m aware it’s pretty much an album worth of new songs)"
5216,2020-12-24 05:25:05,kj0tlu,It'd also be interesting to know how likely the female demographic is likely to buy physicals compared to the male demographic. That might have something to do with it as well as pop music listeners tend to heavily skew female.
5217,2020-12-24 10:50:37,kj0tlu,"the artists with ""devoted fans"" are all artists that blew up like 10+ years ago. I don't think that's how it really works, it's all an age group thing... people 25+ way more likely to buy rather than stream 

&#x200B;

the only exception is BTS but they're just a freak of nature. Never seen anyone elses fans act that way"
5218,2020-12-24 02:03:56,kj0tlu,"> Yeah I would guess that there are a lot more Taylor Swift listeners above the age of 25 than Kid Cudi or Jack Harlow for instance.

I mean jack for sure but cudi? if you were in high school when he came up you are like 25-28 now."
5219,2020-12-24 02:31:05,kj0tlu,Like reentry rules or something but i don't think there is a way to stop Christmas from dominating that does not have other unwanted consequences
5220,2020-12-24 02:29:58,kj0tlu,Idk i am not sure i would even be comfortable with a change TBH.
5221,2020-12-24 00:28:12,kj0tlu,if Adele comes she will destroy everyone lol. 3 million is absolutely insane. I remember Hello was so fucking big.
5222,2020-12-24 03:33:09,kj0tlu,"I mean I think you could say the same thing about Taylor Swift, but you are right, Cudi has been around for quite a while now and many of his biggest fans are in that age group."
5223,2020-12-24 04:44:32,kj0tlu,"ironically enough the rules used to be that Christmas songs went recurrent after appearing on the chart once. this is still true for non-holiday songs but a couple of years ago billboard changed the rules for Christmas songs allowing it to re-chart. another funny thing is that the song didn't even chart on billboard until 2000 because at the time of release, singles had to be available for physical purchase and it originally was not (it was obviously available as part of her album but not as a standalone like the rules required it to be). so blame billboard for changing the rules.

i do have to give her credit because that's one of relatively few Christmas songs from after, like, the 50s that people have started considering a classic holiday song. there are others, you could argue, but not quite as big as it."
5224,2020-12-24 01:38:50,kj0tlu,"Adele just hits that crazy age range, and an age range that's willing to just straight up buy her physical CDs too."
5225,2020-12-24 10:16:46,kj0tlu,Last Christmas has a movie named about it easily a classic

5356,2020-12-20 20:32:26,kgyxvt,"Peonia and Tyrantrum. Not many know it, but she can actually appear as an ally in Max Raid Battles (not Dynamax Adventures) using a Tyrantrum."
5357,2020-12-20 18:28:14,kgyxvt,"Nice chart! There are a few things I disagree with in terms of Pokémon selection (such as Zamazenta going to Shielbert, who it visibly dislikes, as opposed to Hop, who canonically catches it in Sword version) or likelihood to be added, but overall it's a very comprehensive list of trainers currently absent from the game."
5358,2020-12-20 20:45:43,kgyxvt,"If they add Miror B, they better give him his disco theme"
5359,2020-12-20 18:41:25,kgyxvt,"☆》**Wes (Colosseum) & Umbreon/Espeon**

☆》**Eusine (HGSS) & Suicune** (but will probably end up being in the LA)

☆》**Ash and Grenjnja**: Feel like they have a chance considering it's canonical to the games now?

Although there isn't too many left to add, from my knowledge of the series anyway. Will rack my brain some more but damn you've done dug deep, son.

Edit: Also **Colress** is better suited to **Magnezone** than **Klingklang**."
5360,2020-12-20 18:56:48,kgyxvt,My most wanted are Copycat with Ditto and May with Blaziken (fine... I’ll take Mudkip as well).
5361,2020-12-20 19:11:12,kgyxvt,I think if we can get sogaleo as a sync pair getting arceus would be awesome as well. Considering that arceus was supposed to be an event in platinum but was never released.
5362,2020-12-20 20:51:59,kgyxvt,What about standard Red
5363,2020-12-20 21:18:00,kgyxvt,wouldn't Inver get that Kalos squid mon that has you turn the screen upside down to evolve it
5364,2020-12-20 22:10:32,kgyxvt,Lucas from DPP isn't on here - I'd guess they'll give him a legendary (Dialga?) but they may just do what they did with Nate and give him some random Sinnoh mon like Pachirischu
5365,2020-12-21 00:45:42,kgyxvt,"Johanna (Lucas/Dawn mother) and her Kangaskhan named Jumpy are missing from the list!

Tristan and Tauros from the Title Challenge in SuMo could also be added."
5366,2020-12-21 01:11:36,kgyxvt,"Man, Miror B is my top sync pair request for this game.

Also, no Nia and Weavile? [Cries in Pokken]"
5367,2020-12-21 02:34:26,kgyxvt,"I would have Archer, Ariana, and Sycamore higher in likelihood, since they appear in the animated trailer when it’s going through a bunch of characters."
5368,2020-12-21 04:44:50,kgyxvt,"I literally only got to ""Magikarp Salesman and Magikarp"" and you're 100% right. He needs to be added right away."
5369,2020-12-21 05:47:18,kgyxvt,"I like the chart but I’m curious 

Why Shauna with Chespin over the other rivals, or another starter? 

Who do you think get the missing starters? (Greninja, Intelleon/Rillaboom or both)? 

I can’t imagine only Ash Greninja gets in. 


And lastly; 

Who will get mega sceptile? He’s my favorite"
5370,2020-12-21 05:48:22,kgyxvt,"Also N got Zekrom. So Reshiram is hard to predict now. 

Lol, I hope the Nobunoga game, Pokémon Dynasty, protagonist gets him. 

Zoroark needs to join too."
5371,2020-12-22 00:19:07,kgyxvt,I followed most of your advices guys ;)
5372,2021-01-09 02:17:44,kgyxvt,I'd say Trevor would also get Florges other than Aerodactyl unless Florges is used for a Valentine/seasonal sync pair
5373,2021-01-19 05:08:59,kgyxvt,I think Darach has big chances of being a scout
5374,2021-03-01 07:29:59,kgyxvt,I think if Milo has a Tech sync pair it would be Eldegoss but as a striker or support its either Flapple or Appletun
5375,2021-03-01 09:58:06,kgyxvt,"Some additional sync pair suggestions for this list could be:

Faba & Bruxish (would be a bit weird of a choice but he has it in the game/ some Alola mons)

AZ & Golurk (I doubt about Floette Eternal even though it would make a great lore story, AZ never battles with his Floette but Golurk is used. Also more ground types are good)

Shauna & Goodra (In the case where she doesn't get gen 6 starters, Goodra is prolly the best option for her)

Zinzolin & Kyurem (Since Ghetsis will prolly get Reshiram now, Kyurem could just be for Zinzolin for his role in B2W2)

Anabel & Blacephalon (In USUM postgame with Looker and Anabel, there are two Ultra Beasts that can be encountered during the Looker Post game story with either Stakataka or Blacephalon. So if Toxicroak goes to Saturn then Looker could get Stakataka as another option)

Archer & Magmortar (Since Archer already got a Magmar, why not just straight up give him a Magmortar?)

Brandon & Regirock (Brandon definitely gets one of the Regis but I think Regirock stands out most since he's the Frontier Brain for Battle Pyramid and since he's an explorer in ruins. The 'rock' bit sounds about right for him

Tierno & Crawdaunt (Mainly used by Tierno in the main games if Team Aqua doesn't get Crawdaunt first)"
5376,2021-03-08 16:09:51,kgyxvt,Where are Dexio and Sina? They are very notable
5377,2021-01-28 22:39:29,kgyxvt,Updated with the most recent news!
5378,2021-01-28 22:46:05,kgyxvt,Guys! What pokémon could we give to the trainers whose ace is already in the game in another sync pair?
5379,2021-05-16 11:26:15,kgyxvt,"Now that we know about the BP sync pairs, should we do another list for notable characters who are already in the game but could have another partner?"
5380,2020-12-20 18:38:17,kgyxvt,"Yeah feel free to leave comments, critiques and suggestions! I haven’t played the mainline pokémon games since gen 6, so most definitely I may have gotten things wrong"
5381,2020-12-20 19:07:28,kgyxvt,Iirc they have references to the anime in character dialogue but from what I understand no anime characters are going to be added. It’s probably why a character like Lillie who in the show has alolan vulpix shiron/snowy but she has cleffa in masters like she does in game. It’d be super cool but I’m 100% certain ash won’t be added to this game and I’m also 100% certain his sync pair would not be with greninja. :(
5382,2020-12-20 19:05:09,kgyxvt,"I've added Wes from Colosseum and Ash, as well as Magnezone to Colress (even if Magnezone is a bit of a overused pokémon). Eusine I think was already on my list, but I have to check!"
5383,2020-12-20 19:00:50,kgyxvt,"Yeah I decided for Swampert since at least we have Torchic for our Protag but I'd rather she had Blaziken too, if they can find a way to still create a Sync Pair with Swampert"
5384,2020-12-20 19:04:00,kgyxvt,"I've added Ditto to Coypcat, love the idea!"
5385,2020-12-20 20:56:53,kgyxvt,I didn’t include characters that are still in the game in some shape or form!
5386,2020-12-20 21:24:22,kgyxvt,"He is never shown using it sadly, as much as it fits with the theme!"
5387,2020-12-20 21:25:52,kgyxvt,I still went ahead and added Malamar to Inver!
5388,2020-12-21 05:49:23,kgyxvt,"Dialga is one of the best, and I really don’t care for Lucas. So I could see this happening lol. 

Unless DPPt remakes get new protagonists which isn’t likely. (Please be megas not dyna’s)"
5389,2020-12-20 22:26:36,kgyxvt,How could I forget him :O
5390,2021-03-01 14:08:20,kgyxvt,"Just thought of something for Lucas, it seems like a tiny detail but it could be Spiritomb. Gen 4 protagonist can catch a level 25 spiritomb in DPPL as part of the story. So if Lucas doesn't get Regigigas, this could be the best that it could be"
5391,2020-12-21 09:42:22,kgyxvt,I did a concept for him a while back!
5392,2020-12-22 00:17:11,kgyxvt,"Because she's the only one who actually uses a starter in her team among the missing rivals! And with the admittedly small chance of Ash coming with Greninja, I decided to give her Chespin.

No idea about the rest of your questions, but the MC could always get some of those!"
5393,2021-01-09 17:27:30,kgyxvt,"I totally agree, I thought I had given Florges to someone else but I didn't!"
5394,2021-03-01 09:36:19,kgyxvt,"Yeah I could see him coming with either of those three, though Eldegoss is his main"
5395,2021-03-08 22:51:45,kgyxvt,Added!
5396,2021-03-01 12:13:32,kgyxvt,"Wow, thank you! I’m gonna add them as soon as I can!"
5397,2021-03-05 15:18:08,kgyxvt,Added!
5398,2021-03-08 21:25:30,kgyxvt,"Thanks for your comment, I’ll add them as soon as I can!"
5399,2021-03-08 22:52:02,kgyxvt,Added!
5400,2020-12-20 19:11:57,kgyxvt,I edited both Sordward and Shieldbert to get Sirfetch'd and Falinks respectively!
5401,2020-12-20 19:09:22,kgyxvt,"Awh, man. That's a shame!"
5402,2020-12-21 00:52:20,kgyxvt,Isn’t Team Rocket in this game specifically based on the anime in order to promote the most recent movie? This is the only game where they let Meowth speak human.
5403,2020-12-20 19:06:04,kgyxvt,"Wes! That's it! Eusine might be, apologies if I missed that!

Edit: Yeah, Eusine was there, my bad!"
5404,2020-12-20 20:59:08,kgyxvt,"Oh sorry, didn’t see that, but what do you think standard Red would be?

I’m thinking tech to complete the standard Kanto trio"
5405,2020-12-21 01:09:55,kgyxvt,"huh that's some upside-down logic from gamefreak, of all the mons malamar would just fit well, and its typing is pretty neutral so it wouldn't be hurt by the inverse battle gimmick"
5406,2020-12-21 13:22:34,kgyxvt,"I have an attachment to Lucas because I spent more time with him than most of the others combined, but yeah he's kinda bland - all the Gen 1-4 protagonists got fleshed out more, and from gen 5 onwards they gave them a bit more personality.

I very much doubt Dialga will get a mega, but we'll see."
5407,2021-03-01 16:59:57,kgyxvt,"I'm pretty sure Lucas will be saved for tie in with the remakes at the end of the year, I'd guess he gets Dialga - as this will generate the most hype (and Gloria showed that just putting a version legendary in as a regular sync pair with a banner is fine)"
5408,2020-12-22 00:26:15,kgyxvt,"Yeah, they may make Sygna Suit Calem for Greninja if not Ash, and Sygna suit Gloria for the starter. 

I could see Leon incorporating Dynamax into his moveset and thus another charizard. 
Plus we don’t have charizard Y. Then again mewtwo has neither mega form so maybe they won’t be doing this."
5409,2021-03-06 04:22:05,kgyxvt,"Here's a follow up for more possible sync pairs:

Hugh & Unfezant (An alternative for Hugh if he doesn't get Bouffalant (probably more likely to get Unfezant)

Olympia & Sigilyph (Another possible sync pair mon other than Meowstic if female meowstic doesn't go to Emma)

Malva & Talonflame (Another likely candidate for Malva sync pair if not Pyroar as well)

Dexio & Zygarde (Since Dexio gives you a mission to find Zygarde Cells in Alola, it would make sense to give him Zygarde while Sina could keep Glaceon as a sync pair)

Profesor Burnet & Necrozma (Since Profesor Burnet is a researcher on different dimensions, I think it could be suitable to give her Necrozma because of her alternate dimension research. An event for Burnet could be Burnett giving light back to Necrozma to restore its power)"
5410,2020-12-20 19:18:56,kgyxvt,"Maybe it's a rights problem? Idk. Still, I added Ash and Greninja, this is a fan project after all ;)"
5411,2020-12-21 01:09:55,kgyxvt,That’s a great point actually! I didn’t consider that :)
5412,2020-12-20 19:12:46,kgyxvt,"No problem dude, it's a lot of sync pairs to look at, you can miss one for sure xD"
5413,2020-12-20 20:59:44,kgyxvt,I agree! Maybe he’ll come with Snorlax?
5414,2020-12-21 09:41:08,kgyxvt,I see what you did there xD
5415,2020-12-21 15:06:34,kgyxvt,"That’s fair! Wasn’t trying to crap on him sorry if I came off harsh there. 


I do too, sadly"
5416,2021-03-02 00:41:23,kgyxvt,"Yeh I guess you are right. Since there is no other character who could get Dialga other than the protagonist, it just makes sense to give him a legendary now"
5417,2020-12-22 09:40:24,kgyxvt,Yeah Sygna Suits are always a chance!
5418,2021-03-08 22:51:51,kgyxvt,Added!
5419,2020-12-20 19:14:34,kgyxvt,"Good job again though, mate. This is a sick list for sure."
5420,2020-12-21 18:04:23,kgyxvt,"Tbh in my mind Lucas is basically Red - looks not unsimilar, has about as much personality. I'll probably get annoyed when PM (very reasonably) makes him an actual character - but we'll see..."
5421,2020-12-20 19:17:17,kgyxvt,"Oh no prob at all, I liked creating it! Of course the hard part would be having all these characters using unique pokémons, but that's the devs' problem if they ever do get to see this list and use it (which is a dream of mine of course xD especially for the spin-off characters whom I would love to see get in Pokémon Masters)!"
5422,2020-12-21 19:01:41,kgyxvt,Maybe hes just a calm and quiet dude
5423,2020-12-20 19:19:13,kgyxvt,"The spin-offs had some of the best characters imo, fr. Especially Colosseum, Gale and Rangers."

5494,2020-12-19 00:15:53,kfew9v,it's a reference to willow from buffy the vampire slayer??? lol...
5495,2020-12-17 04:12:40,keozkt,This is so awesome.
5496,2020-12-17 16:15:00,keozkt,Never really had any opinion of Willow before these Deftones covers and now I’ve got mad props for her. Her vocals are a unique spin on it.
5497,2020-12-17 11:20:07,keozkt,"Damn, if 90% of covers have had this quality... Beautiful."
5498,2020-12-18 15:09:42,keozkt,This is sick. And she’s playing the Sarah Longfield signature guitar.
5499,2020-12-17 15:54:12,keozkt,Oof
5500,2020-12-17 18:19:59,keozkt,"Honestly blows my mind. I didn’t check out the others she did. Also, wtf is that drummer doing in the beginning? I used to play the real break all the time on a kit for fun. Maybe he is just having fun but for playing that song i just want to hear the original drum pattern"
5501,2020-12-17 16:07:32,keozkt,Her singing style and voice isn't good for this type of music. She sounds like a  country singer covering deftones. Its just not a good mix. She needs a more feminine and softer voice to pull off deftones. 3/10
5502,2020-12-17 16:30:40,keozkt,"I saw her be quiet and drive cover  posted here and it was probably the most garbage Be quiet and drive cover I'd ever heard.

This is a real deftones cover.
