Who the fuck believes this PR creation has a chance in hell. From his cheesy fucking staffer dance, to their uber corporate PowerPoint style guide, to his claiming victory in the IAcaucus. Christ on a cracker people are delusional."
3,2020-02-05 16:39:59,ezbene,What a putz. Pete is a putz and so is Tc for a calling this manufactured cnn garbage uplifting.
4,2020-02-05 19:50:28,ezbene,I felt a bit of the Obama vibe as I watched Pete Buttigieg make a speech after Iowa. I can see where David Gergen is coming from.
5,2020-02-05 17:58:27,ezbene,"A couple of months ago it was said the earlier stages of the primary would be Biden vs Buttigieg and Sanders vs Warren. Really though, if we end up with Biden taking the dive and either Sanders or Warren emerging as the stronger candidate by the end of SC (particularly should Yang not make a stronger showing, fingers crossed). We really couldn't be better off. Whether it's Buttigieg vs Sanders, Buttigieg vs Warren, or a Yang upset in either case absolutely none of these options deserve to be snubbed."
6,2020-02-05 15:11:15,ez9v55,"If Buttigieg is ""charismatic"", then the word has no meaning. Also, he's not ""left-wing"" by any stretch. He's very much a conservative. This is one of the somewhat hilarious aspects of this whole mess, that fascists can't be called that, so they're called conservatives, which means anyone to the left of them becomes a progressive by default. 

Also, he has absolutely no support from anyone who isn't white, so good luck with that."
7,2020-02-05 18:02:30,ez9v55,"Some surveys from South Carolina, taken within the past few weeks, have shown Pete with 0% black support. Meaning, that of the thousands of people surveyed, not a single black voter said he’s their first choice. Pete consistently polls at 2% among voters under 35. He is disliked by those two groups because of his personality and his policies. Unless he can dramatically change his behavior and his policies, which will obviously make him look inauthentic to voters, he cannot win the nomination."
8,2020-02-05 17:18:43,ez9v55,I’m done with Mayor Pete. His campaign lined up a row of black supporters behind him for his Iowa speech. He’s been trying to show/repair his ties to the black community and this was a sad attempt at doing it. It’s right out of Trump & the Republican’s playbook. I cannot believe he’s getting a pass on it by so many Democrats.
9,2020-02-05 15:04:30,ez9v55,"He's fine, and his policy positions seem pretty boilerplate. Which is to say, he's the pseudo-technocratic robot candidate that has uninspiring boilerplate positions. He doesn't *move* me, and to be honest, I think the 2000s America has done just fine by him, and I just don't believe he understands why people feel need to call for change.

Another way to put it: Obama was incrementalist. It barely worked because it was incremental, and the real problem with Obama's incrementalism is that small steps are easy to retreat from, which is exactly what happened with the ACA. Moreover Obama was *Obama*, and this guy is no *Obama*. He's not a great orator and he doesn't invoke excitement.

One last thing. Buttigieg has largely avoided controversy because the controversy of the primary thus far has been Sanders' and Warren's stances on health care. I'm worried that this primary hasn't done a good job vetting his mayorship."
10,2020-02-05 14:51:53,ez9v55,"Is he a charismatic young leader, in the mold of JFK, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Obama? I don't get the charisma, but I have to say I haven't paid that much attention to him.

I don't think he's held a consequential enough job to make the leap to president. Bloomberg ran a city of 8 -10 million with a huge budget. While I don't love Bloomberg, I trust his bonafides a bit more than Mayor Pete.

That said, if he wins the nomination I will Boogie with Buttigieg.

PS- I dunno that America is ready to elect someone with a last name that hard to spell and pronounce. I know it's Maltese, but it's a lot weirder than Barrack Obama."
11,2020-02-05 15:03:37,ez9v55,"I like the guy. Right now he's tied for my number 2 with Sanders. If Warren is still around she's getting my vote but past that I'm torn on those two.

I like the idea of a younger guy without experience. I realize the ""no DC experience"" thing is tarnished by Trump, but for me I can differenciate between an old (wannabe) billionaire without experience and a younger civicly minded guy.  And going by his platform (and admittedly ignoring some of his tacking Right campaign speak) I think he's actually really liberal. He wants to pack SCOTUS for pete's (ha!) sake, among other things.

I'd like to hear him speak more about political money as a problem then he does but really I'm only seeing that from Warren anyways. Sanders is off doing his revolution thing and no one else is running on it. So if Warren drops out I'd be picking between a bunch of people that don't stress that issue anyways."
12,2020-02-05 15:17:19,ez9v55,"When I took one of those online ""who's your ideal candidate"" dealios.... it told me Pete was.

But again... I'd vote for a turnip over trump.

I do presently like Pete.  I tend to value that he's former military, and so I think he's going to have some aptitude for foreign policy and long-term thinking.  I probably do personally favor a centrist... but I'm not necessarily opposed to more liberal candidates and their ideas.

I like Warren because I think she understands money and would make the oligarchs shake.

I like Sanders because I believe as he does... if you address the economic disparities in this country you'll do the most for everyone and probably the most fairly.  I recognize that this does not hit sexism and racism as hard as some would like, but I just see it as an order of operations problem... addressing economics makes addressing the other things easier.  


In the past couple of years I've become fed up with health care in this country... fed up with our dependency on fossil fuels... fed up with wall street gaming the system."
13,2020-02-05 20:15:47,ez9v55,So when Bloomberg drops out do you think he teams up with Buttigieg to make the all-cash super team?
14,2020-02-05 15:00:26,ez9v55,"Of course if he is the eventual candidate I will vote for him; there's no doubt in my mind that he's better than Trump.  But he's not better than Warren, Harris, or Sanders.  He's not better than Cory Booker."
15,2020-02-05 16:56:28,ez9v55,"I like Pete, I like his ideas, his personality and his discipline. 

That said, the Dems need someone who's ready to walk up to DJT and punch him right in the mouth (figuratively). Someone who can take the fight to him. I don't see Pete as being that guy."
16,2020-02-05 17:07:00,ez9v55,[Why Pete is a horrible candidate for the DNC](https://thegrayzone.com/2019/12/17/national-security-mandarins-groomed-pete-buttigieg/?fbclid=IwAR36HEhjoh5PBVZo4CI-IcAXtuEMpfOwhx6Reenz0bPCrtDXhyodfZRIUNA)
17,2020-02-05 20:13:34,ez9v55,"On the subject of young charismatic leaders:

I was thinking this morning...research shows that psychedelics are one of the only things that reliably raise ""openness"" scores. 

Those of you who were there do you think psychedelics played a role in the election of John f Kennedy?

I supposed it's hard to gauge. It's not like there's a detailed map of LSD use across the United States.

with growing legalization maybe we'll see more young  candidates in the future."
18,2020-02-05 14:06:01,ez9v55,"Ok. Besides the fact that his agenda is largely just boiled down versions of ideas cribbed from those of others, and, is  missing the essential first step remedies necessary to accomplish the rest of it (corruption and corporate reforms), the sales pitch still falls short. He's younger and less accomplished than the other candidates to whom he is being compared. He's not particularly charismatic, nor has he demonstrated much by way of real leadership skills. But, perhaps most importantly, he has difficulty even ""convinc[ing] people [in]side the party’s base that Democratic values are [his] own."""
19,2020-02-05 14:18:32,ez9v55,Good article it does narrow the policy differences.  I mean compared to Bloomberg Buttigieg and Sanders are buddies.  Both Buttigieg and Sanders are successfully widening the Democratic Party appeal.  Buttigieg pulls in non-Trump conservative leaning independents and even former Republicans and Sanders the young and Latino voters.
20,2020-02-05 14:31:51,ez9v55,[removed]
21,2020-02-05 15:18:23,ez9v55,His campaign has charismatic *branding*.
22,2020-02-05 15:24:01,ez9v55,"Democratic success is absolutely dependent on strong minority turnout; Clinton's campaign failed in part because that turnout in critical states was sharply lower than it had been in 2012.  This article omits that issue entirely.

It also somehow ignores the fact that Buttigieg attempted to win statewide and failed.  In 2010 he was the Democratic nominee for state treasurer in Indiana and lost to Richard Mourdock by 62 percent to 37 percent.  There were certainly extenuating factors (this was a very bad Democratic year, no other Democrat won statewide, and Mourdock was the incumbent).  But it's nonetheless true that Buttigieg got absolutely buried.

The heavy emphasis in this article on policy positions could be appealing to folks on TAD and to a certain segment of the Democratic party, but campaigns are more than their white papers.  Buttigieg would simply be an enormously risky candidate, at a time when the case for taking risks is very weak."
23,2020-02-05 15:33:31,ez9v55,Do you consider the policies listed in the article progressive?

27,2020-02-05 15:35:15,ez9v55,"If people object to incrementalism, they need to be focused on Congress.  I doubt very much that Sanders’s programs will ever be law, but there is absolutely no chance for dramatic change as long as the GOP holds the Senate.  I don’t fault maximalists for voting their beliefs, but I just never see the same passion for reshaping Congress."
28,2020-02-05 15:35:36,ez9v55,"I mean, I've been trying to get a reason to vote for Sanders that moves me and no one has been able to illustrate one.  Prior to the results of Iowa, my thoughts were -- well I hope he picks a great VP."

Strong disagree on the last half of that, however much either of us thinks single payer would be better.

33,2020-02-05 15:14:23,ez9v55,""" I think he's actually really liberal.""

It's on that perception issue where we part ways. To me, he's very much in the fold of the Bush-type Conservatives, and had it not been for the Republican Party's opposition to gay rights and reactionary turn, he'd be an R."
34,2020-02-05 15:21:20,ez9v55,"See, I think the court packing is actually a big liability. But otherwise mostly agree."
35,2020-02-05 21:08:26,ez9v55,I'm sure Bloomberg would prefer Buttigieg over Sanders or Warren.
36,2020-02-05 21:33:45,ez9v55,I don't think Bloomberg is going to drop out. I think he's going to just keep funding anti-Trump ads all the way to the general.
37,2020-02-05 16:25:07,ez9v55,This. Fucking Iowa is at least partially responsible for the loss of Harris and Booker.
38,2020-02-05 20:29:49,ez9v55,Thanks for sharing that article!
39,2020-02-05 17:53:39,ez9v55,"Describing the chaos in Syria as a ""US-backed proxy war that had ravaged the country’s population"" is an interesting take."

42,2020-02-05 14:28:41,ez9v55,"I'm not sure I see much space between Buttigieg and Bloomberg. The former's pretty much just the new face of neoliberalism. Though, ""Now with 10% more redistribution."""

44,2020-02-05 15:37:45,ez9v55,"Yeah, this is it - he personally is about as charismatic as the gravel pile in my apartment courtyard, but he's been marketed as ""young gay christian liberal military vet with a school teacher hubby and midwestern charm,"" and folks respond to that marketing, for better or worse.

I like him in a ""he's a robot and he's fine"" sort of way and I would have no hesitation voting for him if he's the candidate, but let's be real about how he's performed and the impression he's made so far against the other candidates."
45,2020-02-05 15:28:30,ez9v55,On this logic then we should nominate Biden. Hard pass.
46,2020-02-05 15:35:24,ez9v55,"""This article omits that issue entirely. ""

Possibly because the whole point of the article is to make the case FOR Mayor Pete.  It's not trying to dissect his strengths and weaknesses."
47,2020-02-05 16:55:16,ez9v55,That Richard Mourdock guy is GROSS.
48,2020-02-05 15:43:45,ez9v55,"Compared to the Republican position? Sure. Don't get me wrong. I didn't mean that he's a conservative as a pejorative. It's that he's in a big-tent party with people that have way more progressive manifestos in 2020, and there's really no reason to choose him other than ""Republicans who hate Trump"" will vote for him."
49,2020-02-05 15:39:44,ez9v55,"I don't think that's what he said. He's saying Buttigieg is a true conservative, while the people we call conservatives currently are largely fascist.

I don't 100% agree with this, but I think you're misinterpreting his wording. Unless I'm wrong, in which case correct me."
50,2020-02-05 15:38:54,ez9v55,"Uhm, I think you need to read the comment again."
51,2020-02-05 16:10:33,ez9v55,"Yep.  I also fear the same backlash that Obama had, when (a) he achieved health care but not free universal health care, and (b) the GOP was able tar him with government takeover of health care.  

Sanders (and Warren, to a lesser extent), won’t be able to achieve a quarter of what they promise.  Disaffected young voters won’t turn out, and the GOP will fear monger and demonize their minor progressive accomplishments, leading to losing the house and a smaller Senate minority.  

In short, whoever the Dems elect has to be supported by massive turnout in the midterms, up and down the ballot.  

Maybe Sanders can achieve and maintain that enthusiasm, but I have my doubts."
52,2020-02-05 16:40:46,ez9v55,"> but I just never see the same passion for reshaping Congress  

BINGO!"
53,2020-02-05 16:07:49,ez9v55,"I don't object to incrementalism as the practical outcome, but I do object to it being the target outcome. Look at the modern GOP: their extremism has moved the Overton Window and redefined where the center lies."

I get that you don't like the guy and by all means you are entitled to your position but there is simply no need to turn him into a caricature. By basically any measure he's pretty liberal."
58,2020-02-05 15:25:47,ez9v55,"I'm torn on it. I really do think the judiciary is pretty f\*cked right now because of Federalist Society style political maneuvering that the Ds just haven't done, so it might take something drastic. 

But there is def a pandora's box vibe. 

My ideal solution would be to have terms instead of lifetime for SCOTUS on down and undo the nominating process. SCOTUS still does it but then those justices are responsible for filling the circuits, and the circuits are responsible for filling the districts. I think that would be the least political way to do it."
59,2020-02-06 02:57:08,ez9v55,Really? Seems like he has to drop out and back someone else eventually.

62,2020-02-05 20:35:13,ez9v55,Harris blew through her money making a splashy entrance.  She lost her footing and couldn’t bring enough in to sustain her campaign.  People forget that running a campaign is a big business.
63,2020-02-05 22:29:53,ez9v55,"Yes, definitely. 
Kennedy was a war hero as well as being young and charismatic. He wasn't that radical a choice, unless one was very anti-Catholic."

65,2020-02-05 14:32:41,ez9v55,I think the difference is Buttigieg advocates for human and civil rights while Bloomberg takes them away.

69,2020-02-05 15:33:47,ez9v55,"I mean, we'll nominate as a nation who people vote for.  The Iowa caucus pretty much encapsulated that -- the larger percentage of the combined vote being the Biden, Buttigieg, and Klobaucher group."
70,2020-02-05 17:14:33,ez9v55,"I have set out on TAD over and over again my reservations about Biden, including my serious concerns about his unrealistic views on the state of U.S. politics. That said, absolutely anyone in the Democratic field would be enormously better than Trump; and preserving our democratic system demands defeating him more than any other imperative right now.  

I'd like to see the Democrats nominate someone who would bring to the presidency a real program for the dramatic changes we need to make; that's why I've long inclined toward Warren.  But the first requirement is to win."
71,2020-02-05 17:07:59,ez9v55,"If one takes the thing as a kind of lawyer's brief for Buttigieg, that's understandable; advocates routinely ignore the weaknesses in their clients' cases.  But an exercise in sophistry is not what's needed right now.

The issue before readers of VOX, just as it is with people on TAD, is what candidate to support in a critically important election.  We're citizens, not debate-contest judges.  If pieces of this kind are to help with that decision (and I'm not sure what their point is if they don't), they should face up honestly to both the strengths and weaknesses.  In any case, it's not inappropriate in the context of evaluating this article for purposes of electoral decisionmaking to point out what it omits."

The generational divide obviously isn't uniform by any measure but its a statistical reality and I don't think its going anywhere but worse for the time being. You can't bridge 35% of the population that wants something like universal healthcare and drastic constitutional reform with 35% of the population that thinks there's some sort of evil Red insurgency going on. I just don't see how those positions change in the coming years. Its going to require aging out.

Of course by that time we'll have new young voters proposing who the hell knows what so we'll have new problems."

I still tend to think that after NH (which I think will be similar to Iowa's results) the Southern Primaries are going to knock people out, especially Butt and Klobuchar, and it will be Biden with a slight edge over Warren/Sanders (of whoevers left of those two) 

I hope that's wrong because I think a Biden campaign would hurt our chances in the general (I lean turnout > moderates) and because I think he'd be a pretty terrible president."

91,2020-02-05 17:22:37,ez9v55,"I can understand the interest in issues among progressives, who always find such concerns their catnip.  But in reality, any Democratic president is likely to function somewhat similarly and far better than Trump.  A good deal of a Democratic president's first four years, for example, will involve figuring out and correcting all the nasty ways in which the Trump operatives have been damaging the government. The only legislative action will be housekeeping plus reconciliation -- and the latter will be hampered because Sinema and Manchin will be the deciding votes even if Democrats narrowly control the Senate.  

There are two essential points:  winning the presidency, with any Democratic candidate; and controlling the Senate, so a Democratic president will be able to staff his or her administration and start repairing the damage to the courts."
92,2020-02-05 15:36:52,ez9v55,"OK, first, No those weren't conservative positions 20 years ago. I'm younger than you but I was old enough 20 years ago to remember W's platform. The tax and leave issues alone are a gigantic difference let alone criminal justice reform and electoral reform.

(I also think its important to note that if we go by feasibility of actually implementing any of this in 4-8 years then they're all lying through their teeth for applause.)

Second, 20 years ago was a hell of a lot less bat shit crazy than today, so even if I believed your assertion, I'd take it over a ton of other outcomes."

116,2020-02-05 18:02:04,ez7n7p,"Here is my take: It's not a negotiation, it's a terms of surrender. The Palestinian leadership have increasingly few options as the conflict drags on to the benefit of Israel and their Arab allies grow more and more distant. The Trump administration understand this and tried to frame their peace plan as a starting point for a legitimate Palestinian statehood, because in reality it could be their last chance to ever get it."
117,2020-02-06 12:45:05,ez7n7p,Palestinians wasted too much playing in the sand and imitating activity instead of building a competent government. Now Israel and Gulf States want to finish this chapter and move forward as the conflicts moved to Iran and Turkey.
118,2020-02-05 16:14:15,ez7n7p,"It seems pretty clear to me that the Trump administration and Netanyahu government want the Palestinian political leadership to reject the proposal. That, in turn, also explains why Jared Kushner went on CNN and insulted the Palestinian people when he discussed the deal — insulting your counterparty is generally not something that someone does if they are interested in closing a deal. 

Martin Indyk, by the way, has a long track record of horrible strategic mistakes when it comes to American Mid-East policy. He famously crafted the so-called “dual containment” policy of the 90s and was one of Walt & Mearsheimers’ most sleazy critics after the publication of the Israel Lobby book. What does it say when even he can see what’s going on here?"
119,2020-02-05 18:59:32,ez7n7p,"I think this is more or less right. The Palestinian negotiating position has always been terrible and it is getting worse by the year (especially these last few years when the seven-decade strong previously immovable Arab/Muslim wall of support broke down.)

At the same time after what happened with the handover of Gaza to Palestinian authority in 2005 and the Israeli peace proposals in 2008, Israelis a) don't see any hope of Palestinians agreeing to anything and b) consider the most likely result by far of another handover of territory to Palestinian authority is that it will become another Gaza, aka another large missile base that will be used against them (only this time right next to the major Israeli population centers and airport) while making both Israeli and Palestinian lives miserable.

The most likely outcome now is that this will be decided unilaterally by the Israelis, likely in the form of a Palestinian state (or more probably two, I don't see any reconciliation between Gaza and the West Bank looming in the near future) but with nowhere near the borders Palestinians want or even those they have been offered by Israeli governments in the past.

The longer this continues, the worse their hand becomes."
120,2020-02-05 20:40:19,ez7n7p,"I agree. Indik says that the plan leaves nothing to negotiate, but there *is* nothing to negotiate, Israel and the US hold all the cards."
121,2020-02-05 22:53:51,ez7n7p,"In addition to what you say (total agreement on that) I'd add that Trump doesn't really care if this works. His foreign policy is subservient to American national politics, and this ""plan"", plainly, looks good to conservatives."
122,2020-02-05 23:29:21,ez7n7p,">statehood

What this plan proposes is not a legitimate state any more than a bantusan was."
123,2020-02-05 18:07:01,ez7n7p,There’s about a 50% chance that the next US President will be a Democrat who strongly opposes the Trump peace plan and pretty much all the components in it. The Palestinian would be very unwise to jump at the opportunity to agree to the absolute worst proposal over made in the multi-decade history of the peace talks.
124,2020-02-05 23:36:21,ez7n7p,">That, in turn, also explains why Jared Kushner went on CNN and insulted the Palestinian people when he discussed the deal 

Or it is just that Kushner is a terrible public speaker and puts his foot in his mouth almost every time he gives an interview, which is rarely."

128,2020-02-05 21:00:26,ez7n7p,"No one expects for the Palestinians to agree. This is just a roadmap for what Israel is going to do over the next 4 years. But since the Palestinians won't agree, they won't be getting any money or tunnels or extra territory next to Egypt."
129,2020-02-06 05:39:29,ez7n7p,Doesn't matter who's in office next year or in 2025. Any deals offered to them are just going to get worse in the future.
130,2020-02-06 00:27:53,ez7n7p,"I think my take is more plausible by quite a lot. It's one thing to have Biden-esque ""foot-in-mouth disease,"" but Kushner's statements were so abrasively insulting to the dignity of the Palestinian people that the most logical inference is that he wants them to reject the deal. That serves Israel's political interests because it allows them to continue building more and more settlements in the West Bank."
131,2020-02-05 21:02:17,ez7n7p,How will it change if Trumps out of office?
132,2020-02-06 11:40:25,ez7n7p,"That card is exactly what's disintegrated in the last few years. Israel is already doing business with gulf nations, north african nations and so on now. And their relations are improving without any advance between Israelis and Palestinians."
133,2020-02-06 05:17:35,ez7n7p,That regions were nominally sovereign but were under the control of the South African State.
134,2020-02-05 23:13:24,ez7n7p,"just to add to your point: Palestinian acquiescence to the deal is not even a prerequisite. it is essentially a deal between Israel and the US - with the Palestinian having the option to join it and rip the rewards - or reject it and still watch it go through.

worth mentioning - the deal does offer an enormous economic carrot in the form of over 50b invested into the Palestinian state should they accept."
135,2020-02-06 06:34:26,ez7n7p,You absolutely don’t know that. Israeli proposals got better from the start of the 90’s to the end of the 00’s. And trump is the most pro-Israeli settlement president we have ever had.
136,2020-02-06 03:22:01,ez7n7p,"Perhaps but abrasively insulting the default tone of the Trump White House regarding most all topics, not just the Arab Israeli conflict.  Also, things like his comment about how he is qualified to bring peace to the middle east because he read 25 books on the topic don't inspire faith in him as some sort of 4d chessmaster."
137,2020-02-05 21:05:06,ez7n7p,"Democrats are much more sympathetic to Palestine, and might want to renegotiate to either put Palestine in a better position, or to simply stick it to Trumps admin."
138,2020-02-06 05:34:35,ez7n7p,"The problem with the Bantustans wasn't that the African population didn't get the borders they wanted, or even the fact that the proposed states were in some cases enclaves. No one has an issue with Swaziland, which is also an enclave, and no one had an issue with Germany after ww2 - which was nominally sovereign but really under the control of the allies/russia.

The problem was that South Africa OUTSIDE the Bantustans still had a black majority, and those black people were excluded from the vote. In other words, the problem was that the Afrikaaners wanted labor, not that they wanted land."
139,2020-02-05 23:31:39,ez7n7p,">50b 

No one other than Jared Kushner thinks that is going to materialize."
140,2020-02-06 07:32:43,ez7n7p,"That's a pretty skewed take on it. From '48 to post '67 war to the 2000/2001 offers to the 2014 position to the deal of the century, the offer has gotten worse for the Palestinians each time with *one* exception - Olmert's offer in 2008 which was favorable to Palestinians in the extreme (but still rejected) and which, Olmert himself pointed out, is unlikely to ever be offered by an Israeli Prime Minister again.

The history of this conflict is pretty clear. If the Palestinians are expecting the offer to improve while their negotiating position declines they are going to be in for a rude awakening."
141,2020-02-06 03:31:32,ez7n7p,"If it was just a stupid, off-the-cuff statement then I assume the Trump media team or Netanyahu would have denounced it or they would have tried to backtrack. The fact that they didn't suggests deliberation."
142,2020-02-05 21:11:28,ez7n7p,"- and might want to renegotiate 

But Israel won't want to renegotiate. They will take their Trump gains and ignore anything and everything the DEMs might then want."
143,2020-02-06 00:37:09,ez7n7p,"I'm afraid that under a typical Democratic President, the situation wouldn't be much different.

While the Democratic base is generally more sympathetic to the Palestinians  than the Israelis at this point, the conflict remains a low priority among most of them. Kitchen table issues and domestic politics tend to be much more important. For the extremely influential and well-organized Israel Lobby, on the other hand, maintaining the status quo is a critical issue. This means that the Israel Lobby is well positioned to be the driving force in America's policy towards Palestine. 

I think that Israel started to become a more partisan issue in the Obama administration because Obama openly broke with the lobby on the Iran nuclear deal. It seems to me that the lobby had become a victim of its own success, and picked a fight that put them on a collision-course with a large chunk of the Democratic Party. 

Nonetheless, it seems to me that if a typical Democrat won the White House, we might not see anything like the ""Deal of the Century"" but we'd continue to see endless stalling over the preliminary negotiations for a Two-State Solution, which Israel would use as a pretext to continue building more and more settlements."
144,2020-02-06 05:42:08,ez7n7p,"If we are talking in a purely policy standpoint, post war German treatment involved a whole bunch of crimes again humanity."
145,2020-02-05 23:39:36,ez7n7p,"not sure how you came to that conclusion.

if by some extraordinary chance this is accepted by Abbas - the Gulf States, EU and of course US will most certainly provide the money. there's way too many (self) interests being served not to do so. especially true for the Gulf States that want the Palestinian issue out of the way in order to enlist Israel to curtail Iran."
146,2020-02-05 21:17:12,ez7n7p,"I dont think Israel is going to act so boldly with a democrat controlled US. A lot of the stuff they get away with is because they know they have the full approval of the party in power. Not to say that Israel will do exactly as the US wishes, but they wont just ignore the US..... are you downvoting me?"
147,2020-02-06 05:46:23,ez7n7p,"Well.. yes. The allies ethnically cleansed 12 million Germans from Europe, killed about a million in the process, nationalised their land and property, moved settlers in, and established new settlements in the territories Germany lost.

Given that they burnt German cities to the ground during the war, can you imagine how the Europeans would respond if Germans were lobbing rockets at London today or trying to breach the border with Poland so they can butcher the locals and fulfil their 'right of return'?"
148,2020-02-05 23:42:29,ez7n7p,Because it is the opinion of most all the regional experts in their responses to the plan.  Tamara Cofman Wittes comes to mind.
149,2020-02-05 21:28:00,ez7n7p,"- I dont think Israel is going to act so boldly with a democrat controlled US

Depends on if Netanyahu is still in power. If he is directly challenged by the DEMs in power he could easily ignore them at least till the next administration. 

- are you downvoting me?

No."

What can we do if the democratic election is altered by 3rd parties? Nothing happened when Russia interfered with the 2016 election. Will nothing happen if the DNC and major corporations alter this election so Bernie doesn’t win? 

Will we just have to live through the next presidential term with someone else knowing Bernie should have won? If so, I don’t know how much more of this corrupt system I can take."

This shit is a marathon & we need to stick it out or really we weren’t true supporters of the cause. Keep fighting & the establishment will fall. Trust Bernie who has been on the inside for a long time. If he thought it was hopeless he wouldn’t of ran for President.

It did piss me off that he was misrepresented. The woman singing was the last straw. Several others had gotten all preachy and shit too. I would love to see it, my memory of the event is fuzzy. It wasn't about me. It was about my dad. I was pissed of and he couldn't defend himself. It was made out at the funeral that he was some hugely religious person, but he wasn't.

Footage Notes:

Broseph made an editing mistake in his Episode, so his Episode will be on the Episode 2 post.

Dj's hard drive corrupted shortly after the season was recorded, and all of her footage was lost.

Fleeky is late as of now, but we are hoping his footage will be uploaded at a later time. As of now, he is unresponsive."

Also Obama care, while well intentioned, was and still is a fiasco that was passed using partisan politics which help give rise to the Tea Party and the modern Republican party aka Trump. And also prosecuted political opponents using the IRS.

He also basically goaded Trump to run by lambasting him at a luncheon which made him run.

He was great at speeches, okay at governing."

He was fascinating to look at. Like his teeth where so so white and he like actually black! Like really dark. We were having a chat but he was actually so different looking in person from what you see on TV it really was a total novelty to me. 

I'm not joking. Everywhere you go into London there are black people everywhere. The kids are like cherubs with their fancy hair and your like damn those are some cute little kids. 

It's like how I go to Vietnam with my red hair and they are touching you all the time and wanting to take photos with you or wanting to look at the underside of your arms and laughing. 

Now we have brown people all over the place here in NZ. But black people as you'd know it just weren't. He even my Aussie cousins have never even met an Aboriginal person."

I have a voice, every minority has a voice, if they’d stop screaming for 5 minutes, maybe they’d actually hear us. I want to be treated like a normal human, not a holier-than-thou bargaining chip.

I’m a white guy, but I don’t hear narratives about how every white person likes one candidate because of our race. It’s unacceptable.

In some ways I pity the hardcore Berniebros because they have obviously never been challenged, the majority have never been spat on or assaulted for simply existing, they claim to give a damn about the “oppressed,” but the problem is that they keep labeling us that way. We want to just be people, get jobs via merit, not because we need pity. I’m not a victim, stop labelling me that way for political gain. Yes, everyone struggles in some way or another, but you’re defining us— me, by the hatred we are subject to. That isn’t appealing to our humanity, it’s tokenism.

The other day, in another sub, I pissed off some Bernie bros by pointing out that Biden is leading among African-Americans and women; I heard back that they were all ""honorary boomers"" and that the youth vote was being suppressed by the DNC. 

Really pissed him off when I pointed out that African-Americans face *way* more barriers to voting than young white guys. The victim narrative they have can just be astounding.

447,2020-03-28 14:34:09,fqi9f2,"I don't disagree that the rhetoric from Sanders fanatics verges on racist (disclosure: I'm probably more left-leaning than most users here, but am skeptical about most Dem politicians' ability to enact sweeping campaign promises, from Biden to Sanders), but I would push back on your version of the history of racist rhetoric within the Democratic tent and some of your assertions. 

""The Establishment"" as a term traces back decades; the last time it was this popular was unsurprisingly in the 60's. Even the framing of Obama as an ""establishment"" politician traces back to 2008 when Obama began pulling ahead of Clinton in the delegate count. Also not surprising, given that Clinton was running as the gate-opener candidate who would bring light to the ""hidden"" demographics of working-class Americans and women trapped under the glass ceiling. 

I won't go into the same slog about the 2008 primary that I often do on political subs, but in case you're young enough that you weren't involved, the race-baiting and even outright racist rhetoric from Clinton surrogates tanked her support from black voters; she and Obama began by polling at around 50/50 and she ended with around 15% of the vote. 

So while I agree that white class-essentialism is a gateway to racism in our political culture, I would disagree that ""Bernie Bro"" as ""white liberal or Democrat that disparages POC that vote the 'wrong' way"" is a phenomenon unique to the Sanders campaign. I do think that the ""dirtbag left"" culture is pretty novel; that includes lefty dudes who think that weaponizing crude language and slurs against the faux-civility of our political culture is an effective strategy - they are moronic and often bigoted. Perhaps that group is who you're specifically trying to describe.

""Low-information"" when used as a racist dogwhistle needs to be called out ... but you're not going to find the term ""Latino voter"" seriously discussed on
 centrist Reddit/social-media outside of gloating that Cuban-Americans hate Sanders. The Latino/Hispanic voterbase is obviously far more heterogeneous than is normally described in electoral politics media, but go to E_S_S or neoliberal, and whatever discussion you *can* find around why Mexican-Americans in CA and TX strongly preferred Bernie's message tracks pretty closely to the rhetoric you're calling out. They'll throw out all the reasons why Sanders actually HATES Latinos and why would any Hispanic vote for a Senator who tried to poison your people with radiatioactive waste!? but are at least smart enough to keep the dogwhistles implied.

There's zero treatment of that voting bloc as rational actors, probably because the belief that only angry white bros *really* support Bernie is ingrained in the culture. (Actually, Clinton was the 2008 primary candidate that won a majority of the Latino vote, which I interpret as: Democratic candidates who frame themselves as the most class-conscious have had an in with Latino voters for a decade or two.) 

The rhetoric is highly reminiscent to me of how white folks on pro-Sanders social media hubs discuss things like Biden writing anti-busing legislation with Jesse Helms; using a troubling piece of history to try and dictate to black folks how they should vote and feel, today. 

There's also a tendency among white people on both the left and centrist wings to discuss demographic politics in a manner that's off-putting to me; not discussing *why* minority voters vote the way they do, but simply claiming ownership over the demographics that vote their way and linking it to their overarching ideology. When you look at polling; black South Carolinians overwhelmingly supported the idea of Medicare for All even if they don't think Sanders is the one who can implement it. You won't find that contradiction discussed in moderate spaces, where support for POC, LGBTQ communities and women is tacitly linked with economically moderate beliefs.

(As a related aside: Sanders bears responsibility for the clumsiness and messaging failures that come from using the word ""establishment"" as a cudgel. 
But there are some stellar (imo) organizations that he's come into conflict with that, strategically, *are* part of the ""Democratic Establishment."" Planned Parenthood and the DNC, for example, cycle organizers, office staff, leadership and fundraising sources.

That's not a conspiracy; it creates an experienced, flexible, multifaceted, non-profit workforce, but it also means that allied orgs like PP answer to the same stakeholders as the DNC and would not have the ability to break ranks even if they wanted to. If Sanders was a better communicator, he would know how to differentiate between ""insoluble relationships among the big tent that is the American left"" and ""corruption."")"

No.  The issue is simple: if you're under 35, your knowledge of the horrors of socialism and communism are almost entirely restricted to textbooks, because the USSR collapsed before you were ever aware of it, Cuba is a shell of itself, and the media spent your formative years propping up Hugo Chavez and his destruction of Venezuela as a good thing while failing to connect the dots to Maduro now.

If people were taught and understood that socialism is a deadly ideology, they'd be less likely to support it.

These things are notoriously difficult to study, but in lieu of data, we're flailing about a bit, latching on to whatever *must* be true rather than what we've determined *is* true.

Economics is particularly slippery, especially what we picked up during the Cold War. As far as I understand it, neoliberalism from Austrian economists like Ludwig von Mises sees economics as strictly *a priori* and deductive rather than empirical. The von Mises institute continues to push a dim view of science.

Meanwhile, measuring how sex, gender, and ethnicity affects how people are treated is notoriously difficult and expensive, which leads to a dearth of information about similar claims about those things, and we fill in the gaps with deductive rather than empirical observations."

This calls for 'a plan', no specifics, and id be fascinated what that 5 point plan looks like. Wash hands and stay inside?"
491,2020-03-28 00:03:24,fq6xjw,"Well that’s what the piece is calling on Bush and Obama to do. They can get people on the phone with experience in handling these crises, ask them to assess the situation and make recommendations. Trump might not accept their suggestions, but at this point we are like a rudderless ship — on lockdown until Easter unless we decide to designate risk levels to certain areas/ regions (without having underlying test data on which to base these levels, so I guess it will be the President’s “gut”) and let people go back to work or to school. 

One thing that Bush and Obama could do is get together with the governors and design a purchasing plan for vital equipment (things like swabs to do nasal swab tests which are in short supply and hindering our ability to test) and do it in such a way that states are cooperating in purchasing and not undercutting each other or driving gouge pricing. They might also agree to a standard on “shelter in place” — when to implement it, when to lift it. They could convene panels of experts in different areas (all those areas the Trump administration either chopped or let fallow) who would be a available to consult with the governors or their health departments. And they could get some rich guys to step up and fund efforts. Right now we’ve got a battle of egos going on whose going to get to the cure first. Gates and Zuckerberg or Elon Musk or Trump with some cockamamie quick cute scam like fish tank cleaner ( https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/danvergano/chloroquine-dangers-coronavirus).  Bush and Obama might have better luck at coordinating a global effort because this virus is not hitting all areas uniformly or simultaneously. And what needs to be done for the second wave of this virus that will re-emerge next fall?  The greatest number of deaths from the “Spanish flu” occurred the in the fall after the initial spring outbreak. Trump has made this seem like it’s okay to just wait this out, do some cosmetic work and hope for the best. Think of it as the comb over strategy to pandemic containment."
492,2020-03-28 00:10:01,fq6xjw,"defining risk areas? so telling people *inside* an area to leave now cause next week its on lockdown? what exactly do you think we did in NYC? i live i nthe Bronx. you think im still fucking there?

it would be nice if states had plans, but Cuomo has made it pretty clear you reach certain stumbling blocks. you cannot command industry to do anything. you rely on charity, the feds, and the regular state apparatus. so any plan they invent, regardless of brilliance, needs to be signed off and approved at the federal level, a lot of it taking acts of congress. either that, or they convene state legislatures to write laws giving them federal level authority. im sure that will go in one vote with no debate.

sadly, all we can do is sit at home, wait for a vaccine the normal way you handle anything else. im far less optimistic about how this all goes down, seeing how NY has handled it. no UI for weeks cause phones are clogged, a federal check *3 weeks away* at best. in total cutting my income to a fraction and oh, by the way, stores are sold out. hope you dont have mouths to feed.

its fucked. fucked in a way no press campaign and set of ideas for next time is going to solve."
493,2020-03-28 00:24:21,fq6xjw,"Actually, the states have all the power. Trump can’t order a nationwide lock down. And states are stumbling over each other in the market place. So some coordination would help. True, states cannot force industry to act as the feds can, but banded together they can force Trump to act. So maybe we just need W to climb onto a pile of rubble with a bullhorn and Obama to sing “Amazing Grace” to get us focused on working this problem together. Trump’s single greatest issue is that he thinks only he can solve it. He’s the worst kind of control freak — an incompetent one. Bush and Obama could serve as the fall guys if it doesn’t work out, but at least we’d be coming up with something other than throwing fistfuls of cash into the air and hoping it hits someone sometime other than the guys with long handled cash nets."
494,2020-03-28 00:33:46,fq6xjw,"the states cannot enforce a nation wide lockdown if you want food on grocery shelves and the ability to buy them.

 they cannot handle 100% non essential unemployment, on a state or federal level, with the current system. 700 people are handling 6 million weekly claims for NY. youd need to build a modern UI system on a scale comparable only to UBI. this is something that will be fought tooth and nail by the other side. thats just handling the current 'plan' of lockdown. thats literally the most obvious and simplest solution to the current issue most face. how to quickly and effectively file millions of UI claims and distribute payments. square one will take months if we all agree. and we wont.

any plan bigger than that? impractical and unrealistic beyond comprehension. people dont have bunkers of food. so stores, gas stations. these stay open. 80% of people with the virus have no idea they have it. spread continues. unless youre building an apparatus to deliver food/medicine to peoples homes, they stay going out. no 100% lockdown or quarantine.

the best plan you have is China's state mandated lock down with forced relocation of the infected. thats not happening. certainly not without months of debate.

 we need 1 million ventilators by the end of the spring. we will produce 120k by the end of the year. we need millions of doctors and beds. we will hire students and volunteers and house them in tents.

they have no plan. there can be no plan. not for the immediate crisis. we had a plan. we had offices and people with ideas and charts. we fired them. we ignored their advice and now its frankly too late. this has already spread without containment. 

right now, all we can do is plan for next time. and you will never get republican support for real solutions."
495,2020-03-28 01:14:55,fq6xjw,Prepare for the Zombie apocalypse?  Bullshit. We can do something this time around because this time around is the prelude to the next time which is coming soon. We need someone to step into the leadership gap because we get nowhere without it. The question on the table was having Bush and Obama to step up at this point.  And I think it would be helpful. But you don’t. So you go on in despair and we’ll try to cobble something together over here that might not be perfect but it’s better than the nothing leadership without any plan that we have now.
496,2020-03-28 02:17:00,fq6xjw,"yeah. the disconnect here is there is no way to solve the crisis in the next, say, 30 days. thats just not gonna happen. thats when its all kicking off. not 6 months from now. not a slow roll for 2 years. 

im not poo-pooing having a plan, but we already had one, Obama already hired up all the right people and so the 'plan' is undoing what Trump did, and i dont know how you can think thats a pragmatic strategy at the moment. nor would it even work at this point with community spread and ineffective lockdowns. the 'plan' is to not let this happen.

 we need the right people in the right offices making the right calls before things like this ever happen. thats what Obama and Bush would say. and they would advocate the things they did to fight Ebola. its just that none of that works *after* an outbreak of pandemic proportions. all of it is designed to *prevent* a pandemic.

 its just plain fantasy to expect any type of plan to cover 'after something like this has already happened'. fantasy of the highest order considering the problems we face beyond the virus itself."
497,2020-03-28 02:39:38,fq6xjw,"Well we can agree on Obama. Truth be told we’re in the shit because Don asked for anything with Obama’s name on it and said, cut it. I don’t know what Bush and Obama would say.  I don’t know what they’d advocate. I do know that perception is reality and we have a fatalistic asshat changing direction every other day and making this all personal because it’s always about him. If nothing else, if Bush and Obama could get people to see that this is not a blue/red issue we might be able to avoid people going into supermarkets and spitting on cases of meat because the believe Covid-19 is a hoax. Take care up there in the Bronx. I hear the sirens are wailing more often than usual. My daughter, a healthcare worker, was tested today. Wish us luck out here in CA.

Please, if you have the time, read this over,

I hope you, your family, and friends stay safe by taking the proper precuations as we enter in to confusing and troubling times as we watch a worldwide pandemic unfold with this Coronavirus. Could there be something more deeper going on with all of this? Could we be seeing the signs of the times unfolding? Could this be a door of opportunity for people to open their hearts to what God has to say?

Jesus says to His disciples concerning the last days, ""For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of sorrows"" (Matthew 24:7-8).

We have been seeing a record setting amount of Earthquakes world-wide in various places, incuding places that normally do not receive Earthquakes. Now with this Coronavirus, could this be one of the pestilences that will fall upon us? Where will it leave our economy? Did you know the Bible teaches there will be a cashless society in the last days? Will this be a major stepping stone in bringing that about?

We are approaching a future of a one world cashless money society where they will mandate us to receive an RFID chip inserted in our body. This chip will hold all our data and we will lose much more of our privacy due to the tracking power.

Bigger news than this, did you know that this was all foretold almost two-thousand years ago from a major historical figure named Jesus? Have doubts? Continue reading to see... This could be the most important thing you will ever read.

..""And he (the false prophet who deceives many by his miracles) causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:

And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six"" (Revelation 13:16-18 BRG)...

Referring to the final times, this could only be pointing to a cashless society, which has yet to occur, but we are on the horizon of. How come? Otherwise we could still buy or sell without accepting the mark of the beast between each other if physical currency was still valid. It logically deduces itself to this end.

The mark could not be something spiritual, because the word references two separate physical places. If it was to be spiritual, the text would only conclude one place.

Now here is where it gets interesting. It is startling how on the nail the Bible is with respect to this RFID chip. These are notes from a person named Carl Sanders who worked with a team of engineers to help invent this RFID chip in the 90's.

Mr. Carl Sanders attended seventeen New World Order meetings with heads of state officials such as Henry Kissinger and Bob Gates of the CIA to talk about plans on how to bring about this one-world system. The US government commissioned Carl Sanders to invent a microchip for identifying and controlling the peoples of the nations-a microchip that could be inserted below the skin with a hypodermic needle(a fast, convenient method that would be gradually accepted by society).

Carl Sanders, along with a team of engineers with him, with US grant monies provided by US tax dollars, took on this challenge and designed a RFID chip that's powered by a lithium battery, rechargeable through the temperature changes in our skin. With out having understanding of the Bible (Carl Sanders was not a follower of Jesus at the time), these engineers spent one and a half million dollars doing research on the best and most convenient location to have the RFID chip placed below the skin.

Guess what? These researchers determined that the forehead and the back of the hand(the two places Revelation says the mark will be received) are not only the most convenient locations, however are also the only viable places for rapid, steady temperature changes in the skin to recharge the lithium battery. The RFID chip is approximately 7 millimeters in length, .75 millimeters in diameter, about the size of a grain of rice. It is capable of storing many pages of data about you. All your basic records, work records, crime information, health information, and financial data may be stored on this chip.

Carl Sanders believes that this RFID chip, which he remorsefully helped engineer, is the ""mark of the beast"" spoken about in Revelation 13:16-18. The Greek word for ""mark"" is ""charagma,"" which means a ""scratch or etching."" Additionally it's interesting to be aware that the number 666 is actually a word in the original Greek language. That word is ""chi xi stigma,"" with the final part, ""stigma,"" also meaning ""to stick or prick. Mr. Sanders believes that is referencing to the usage of a hypodermic needle being poked in the human flesh to insert the RFID chip.""

Brother Sanders spoke with a doctor asking what would occur if the lithium contained inside the RFID chip leaked into the body. The doctor replied by saying a terrible sore would appear in that location. Here is what the book of Revelation has to say:

""And the first(angel) went, and poured out his bowl into the earth; and it became a noisome and grievous sore upon the men that had the mark of the beast, and that worshipped his image"" (Revelation 16:2 ASV).

The holy scriptures tell us we cannot buy or sell with out accepting the mark, or the number of its name. That is the number of the beast, 666. Scripture tells us to calculate the number 666. How can we calculate 666?

Here is where it becomes an eye opener. Counting the number of the beast, 666,has been long discussed throughout the centuries, however has finally been made known in these last times by the Holy Spirit. What I will show you establishes itself with the word of God the real interpretation to calculate six-six-six.

In the Bible, God uses the number three to affirm things. A few examples are shared below:

..""So there are three witnesses in heaven: the Father, the Word and the Holy Spirit, and these three are One"" (1 John 5:7 AMPC)..

..""And that he was buried, and that he arose the third day, according to the Scriptures"" (1 Corinthians 15:4 GNV)..

..""Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come"" (Revelation 4:8 BRG)..

Now what's interesting is the the mark of the beast is described in detail in 3 different verses (Revelation 13:16,17,18), and each verse lists 3 distinct characteristics of the given topic. The last 3 being the number 6 being used 3 times in a row. Here is a key point to unlocking how to calculate the number 666.

What does it mean to count the number of the beast, 666? It means to add up. So how could we add up 666? Keep in mind my preceding point about God confirming in threes. Now logically, what would be the most reasonable way to add up the number 666? To count it equally in threes based off the number. It is not reasonable to count it equally as 600+60+6, this would also bring us back to the beginning. We are not able to add it as 600+600+600, or 60+60+60, because there are no zeroes in between or at the end of 666. The only rational option is 6+6+6=18. What's interesting is that the verse that reveals for us to count the number itself is verse 18, being the third verse out of 3 verses that describe the mark of the beast. What is 18 divided by 3? 6. So 3x6=18, or 6+6+6=18.

Another fascinating key point is the only two other combinations (bringing a total of 3 possible combinations) for placing a plus symbol in between the 6's are 66+6=72, and 6+66=72. Add both 72's together and you get 144. Why the number 144 is interesting is because the verse following Revelation 13:18 is the first time in God's word where the 144,000 are being mentioned in detail:

..""And I saw, and lo, a Lamb having stood upon the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty-four thousands, having the name of his Father written upon their foreheads"" (Revelation 14:1 YLT)..

Now if you add up all 3 values by counting 666 by shifting the plus symbol around in all 3 possible combinations, it would be 72+72+18=162. What's fascinating in regards to the number 162, is, if you divide 144,000 by 162, you get 888. The name of Jesus in Greek gematria calculates to 888. The New Testament was written in Greek. Revelation 14:1 not only mentions the 144,000, but also the Lamb who is the Son of God, Jesus.

Now what is fascinating in regards to the the number for Jesus, 888, is that if you apply this identical system, you get 8+8+8=24. Now why the number 24? Revelation chapter 4 tells us there are 24 elders seated around the throne of God. That is the same throne where Jesus sits:

""Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne set in heaven, and One sat on the throne. And He who sat there was like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance; and there was a rainbow

I found an old one from 5 years ago and decided to study its composition under my spectrometer and discovered something unnerving. The Snickers bar currently sold in stores contains 43.67% less rare earth elements by weight, when compared to one sold 5 years ago. Do they think they can fool us? It's hard to wrap my mind around why they would do this. Thorium used to make up 12% of the bar, but now it's at 8%, and now there's only 4% Americium compared to 7% just a while ago. It's all been replaced by organic carbon-based matter, like sucrose and poorly crafted carbohydrates. I'm disappointed in the Mars corporation, and I hope my findings will gain enough publicity to force Mars into reverting back to the old formula. Consider this an open letter.

1. Being vocally opposed to censorship in pop culture (video games, TV, film, comics, etc.) and the hijacking of popular franchises to inject sociopolitical messages.
2. Pushing for the removal of unethical, nepotistic, biased, video game-hating political activists in gaming news sites, and the gatekeeping cliques they form to keep opposition out.

If you're just someone who likes fun/sexy/uncensored video games and doesn't like feminist preaching... that's perfectly fine.  You're just an average person with likes/dislikes.  You can be perfectly happy with that.

But GamerGate actively works to ensure fun/sexy/uncensored entertainment stays that way, and holds a line against neo-puritanism.  So you can browse GamerGate hubs like this and probably find interesting things to read.  

No need to ""sign up"" for anything.  

&nbsp; 

Besides, it's thankless work.  When their nepotism and corruption was first exposed in 2014, gaming journalists got together and published numerous articles claiming we were all just a bunch of misogynist, racist, sexist, transphobic, white supremacist, right wing, white male neckbeard incels.

So saying you support GG invites condemnation from people who don't know better, or do and don't care (because politics).

picking that person to review the game is wrong.

If they want to market their site as a gimmick and say my bible thumping grandma will review these games.  that could be really funny and I'd know that her view is not meant to indicate if i'm going to like the game or not.

It's a small change that doesn't affect the story, but it supposedly wasn't changed in the Japanese script which begs the question, ""why bother changing it at all?"" One YouTube commenter also raised a point I liked that it kinda messes up the relationship between Vincent and Erica where they're comfortable enough around each other to make jokes like these.

First of all, an actual flu can get pretty nasty. It's not a good time, makes you feel rather weak and like utter shit, and sidelines most people for a week or so. People with comorbidities and elderly folk are also at [a higher risk of developing severe complications from the flu](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/index.htm), which is why it is important for them to get vaccinated and be cautious with their health

SARS-CoV-2 is an entire order of magnitude more lethal and much more infectious. Additionally, we don't have a vaccine/ herd immunity for COVID. It is significantly more problematic than your seasonal influenza. 

And the most important part of the world's response flies over the head of a lot of people. We aren't flattening the curve to make this blow over faster, in fact, [flattening the curve](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106451928-1584626557121flatteningthecurve740px.png?v=1584626602&w=740&h=416) means that we will be elongating the time it takes for the pandemic to resolve. But we do it so that everyone who needs care in the ED/ICU is able to receive care. Without social isolation measures, a lot of people are going to get sick very fast, and we will get to the point where doctors will turn away people in need of care. Remember, people are still having heart attacks, strokes, fractures, seizures, other major complications. Our hospitals can only take so much of a burden."

Instead, Trump is insisting on using those conferences to spread misinformation and downplay the risks, and only lets the doctors speak occasionally (sometimes Fauci isn't even present). 

So i dont think the biggest issue is people not trusting doctors (most polling shows people like Dr. Fauci and the CDC are very very highly trusted by the general public, thank god) but rather that the best platform for him to spread information has been usurped by our egomaniac president, so speaking out via other platforms has become more necessary."

757,2020-03-27 03:35:04,fpg8k5,"> Remember, people are still having heart attacks, strokes, fractures, seizures, other major complications. Our hospitals can only take so much of a burden.

And all the lesser concerns will be triaged to the wayside (and rightfully so).  A lot of people are already suffering without treatment because their conditions aren't life threatening- I worry about how bad it'll get at the peak of the pandemic."
758,2020-03-27 10:50:35,fpg8k5,"There’s also been a lot of misconceptions about how dangerous this thing really is and how we (can only speak for the USA) have responded to it. We have more ICU beds than any other country in the world. Italy I believe being second with 12 (35 per 100000 compared to 12 per 100000). We have plenty of ventilators (200k) to last the entire pandemic. It was estimated that 900k would be needed.. total. That’s if you count from when this started, until the last one is needed. 

Also, a recent report from Neil Ferguson (one of the lead epidemiologists in UK, who originally was the voice behind “up to 500k people could die in the UK from this thing”), says that because of how transmittable this thing is, it’s possible that our confirmed cases are very small compared to actual cases. In his report, it went from 500k deaths to 20k deaths, with half of the 20k “not likely to survive to the end of the year, anyway due to failing health pre covid”.  Also states that we should hit the peak across the board in about 2 weeks and it’ll fade out from there.

The world isn’t ending. I’m all for being prepared, but unfortunately it’s looking like we have another swine flu situation on our hands. Blown out of realistic proportion.

More people have the ""normal"" flu and that's why the the total number is higher. If the same amount of people had covid 19 as the amount of people who had the flu, more people will die because 2 is 2000 times greater than 0.1."

The coronavirus is not ""10x deadlier"", regardless of whatever is being propagated or whatever case a doctor is trying to present...there are absolutely no numbers, deductive reasoning, or reality that supports the coronavirus being ""10x deadlier"". Absolutely nothing. The symptoms don't suggest it, the mortality rate...every aspect of it

""Why is everyone freaking out about the broken bridge ahead? Right *here* the train is still on the tracks.""

Did the epidemiologist say there would be millions dead by today? Because the virus won't magically disappear in two weeks. We're probably looking at 14-18 months unless we find a cure or vaccination before then (with current vaccine projections saying at least 12 months before we see one available to the public).

COVID-19 isn't done infecting or killing people. And if you're familiar with geometry, you'll see that the growth rate in the US has been exponential, not linear. There were 15,000 more confirmed cases today, when two weeks ago we were seeing dozens-to-hundreds of new cases per day. And that's not even getting into the worldwide scale of this thing.

Edit: Also, where are you doing your research about mortality rate? [This website](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm) shows the mortality rate in the US for COVID-19 to be ""only"" 1.5% (though that assumes the 82,000 active cases will all survive), while [the CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm) finds that, *at worst*, the flu has a mortality rate of 0.15% (but realistically it's probably closer to .09%). In other words, saying that COVID-19 is 10x as deadly as the flu is probably *understating* how dangerous it is.

And again, that's not factoring in [the worldwide rate](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/), showing 4% of all people we know to have been infected have died (again, assuming none of the current infected people will die). That same site shows that, of closed cases (recovered/discharged + dead), 16% have died."
874,2020-03-27 05:14:32,fpg8k5,"Okay I won’t bother arguing with you because you seem pretty fixed on your point. I‘m just going to quote the video...

>”The reason it’s [coronavirus] is different is because it’s much more transmissible than the flu and more importantly it’s significantly more serious. Let me give you some very quick numbers. The mortality of seasonal flu **that you and I confront every year** is about 0.1%. The overall mortality of coronavirus is about 1%. Sometimes, like in China, it was up to 2-3%. Which means it’s at least 10x more serious than the typical influenza. So when people compare it, in some respect it has some similarities but it’s really different in its degree of seriousness.”

So you can pull up a stat about how more people have died because of the flu in recent months, but it won’t change the fact that the mortality rate for COVID-19 is a lot higher than the flu’s. I think I’m gonna side with the nation’s director of infectious diseases on this one."
875,2020-03-28 07:44:37,fpg8k5,"I don't see why that is common sense. Realtime reported mortality rate for USA is 1.6% with worldwide 17%.

He actually said that his original model was very wrong and that he now expects not much more than 25k to die. So I bring this up to show that a doctor's opinion or projections isn't divine law, and it certainly doesn't overule the facts. Any particular doctor can have an agenda or be compelled to say something that isn't entirely true, just like anybody else. They can also be wrong. Thats the main point of me bringing that up

>We're probably looking at 14-18 months unless we find a cure or vaccination before then

Interestingly, the same epidemiologist is now saying that 14-18 months is not realistic and that the virus will peak in the next month

Well yea, that's just because we are now testing FAR more people due to the social distancing and lockdowns...not because the virus is growing and spreading. The virus has been here for months, but we are barely now...focusing highly on testing, which is why u see the confirmed cases rising.

Corona's mortality rate is only at 1% because less than 100,000 people in the US have been tested. That only serves my point

Well over 550,000 people in the US have been tested.

Of course the fatality rate would be lower if we had perfect test coverage, but that doesn't automatically mean it would be on par with seasonal flu. There are countries with quite high test numbers per capita that still have fatality rates over 1%. And that's not even counting the countries like Italy and Spain that have fatality rates at 7-10%.

>when it's obvious that the corona mortality is only higher because of the lack of volume

How is this obvious exactly? It's obvious that the fatality rate would be lower if we had more tests, yes. But you haven't given any data to suggest it would be *as low as* the flu. It can be lower than we see now and still be significantly higher than the flu."

>while the CDC website finds that, at worst, the flu has a mortality rate of 0.15% (but realistically it's probably closer to .09%). In other words, saying that COVID-19 is 10x as deadly as the flu is probably understating how dangerous it is.


Yea that's if u completely ignore that there are FARR more reported flu infections and hospitalizations so of course the mortality rate is lower ...if we tested everyone for corona the mortality rate for corona would inevitably drop as well. The mortality rate is lower for the flu but that's because it's higher in volume and more people still die from it so saying corona is ""10x deadlier"" is completely nonsensical...from a mathematical and basic deductible standpoint...there is nothing u can say that would lend to that. I mean all of this is just common sense

Rather, he could be connecting it as follows: Opposing a government that has communicated with protesters with peace and reasonable discourse is much different from opposing a government that has killed protesters. The actions of the government with regard to people in similar situations to the HK protesters have ended in many deaths. That is relevant information to the discussion. The HK protests are not occurring in a vacuum. The history of the treatment of protesters by the government matters. Of course when discussing relevance however, there is room for it to become subjective. In my view, in the case of the HK protesters, there is relevance.

> Do ppl mention the thousands that have died opposing the US government when discussing the Trump Administration's family separation policy for illegal immigration?

It depends on whether it is relevant. If the government has a history of killing protesters, especially recently, then yes. The US has killed a lot of people to be sure, but take an example of civilian deaths overseas. While abhorrent, those deaths are not relevant to discussing whether domestic protesters protesting policy issues might also be killed in a similar manner.

*Test numbers* that rival that? Easy. The US has had [18,904](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/#S6) confirmed flu hospitalizations since October (and apparently [around 200,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flu_season#Cost) hospitalizations ""usually"" for the full flu season) vs 579,589 coronavirus tests in less time. Norway has had [just over 2800](https://www.fhi.no/contentassets/678386f6617949818dab709c9339090a/vedlegg/2020-12-influensaovervaking-2019-2020-uke-12.pdf) hospitalizations this flu season vs 73,089 coronavirus tests in less time. Switzerland has [112,000 to 275,000](https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/krankheiten-im-ueberblick/grippe.html) medical consultations for flu every year vs 91,400 coronavirus tests in at most a couple months (most likely most of those are in the last month or so).

1) At no point was it ever stated that the US has not killed civilian protesters. 

2) It was stated that killing one group of people for one reason does not necessarily create an immediate link to assume the killing of a different group of people for a different reason. 

3) Let me add a line that shows you how you have failed to read:

> It depends on whether it is relevant. If the government has a history of killing protesters, especially recently, then yes. The US has killed a lot of people to be sure, but take an example of civilian deaths overseas.

4) Your ""point"" does not invalidate what I wrote, it actually reinforces it by providing an example to this part of comment:

> If the government has a history of killing protesters, especially recently, then yes.

If you want to discuss protesters in the US, then yes, Kent State would be relevant to bring up. You are probably confused given the nature of the Kent State shootings. I am sorry that the nuance has eluded you. Let me help you to understand.

The deaths in Cambodia are not necessarily relevant to present-day protesters in the US. The deaths of protesters protesting the deaths in Cambodia *are* relevant to present-day protesters in the US. Without the deaths of those protesters, the issue would not be relevant, it is only the deaths of those protesters that makes it relevant. And the nature of the protest is relevant only insofar as it relates to the protesters while discussing the potential killings of protesters.

1049,2020-03-25 16:56:48,fothvw,"It's been debated. One interpretation is that he can't be VP. The other is that he could, but if called to become POTUS again, could only serve for 2 years before being requires to resign. 

In either event, not likely to ever happen."
1050,2020-03-26 07:59:49,fothvw,"It depends on what it means to be ""eligible to the office of President,"" which is one of the qualifications for the vice president.

Barack Obama is completely ineligible to be *elected* president, but being elected isn't the same as holding the office. The 22nd Amendment doesn't directly regulate how long anyone can *be* president\*, only how many times they can be elected (twice or once, depending on the circumstances). Is someone who can't be elected ""eligible to the office""? It's not a question with a definite answer, and since it would be a political non-starter, it will probably never be answered. (It's not even clear who would answer it if it did come up. The courts might say it's a political question and thus not their problem to solve.)

\*People often add up a two year successive term plus two elected terms to come up with ten years, but that assumes that someone only succeeds to the presidency once. It's possible to become VP again after succeeding to the presidency (it almost happened to Gerald Ford in 1980) so someone could exceed that supposed 10 year cap by succeeding to multiple partial terms before their first election. (Had Ford become VP in 1980 as Reagan wanted, and had John Hinckley been a slightly better shot, Gerald Ford would have gone into 1984 having been the president for a little more than six years, but he still would have been eligible for a single full elected term.)"

Zum einen muss ich schmunzeln wenn sie sich widersprechen. Es gibt gar keine Viren (mit dem Totschlagargument: ""man sieht sie ja nicht!"") aber andererseits hat Merkel den Virus in Auftrag gegeben um die Macht an sich zu reißen. 
Danach tun mir diese Leute oft leid, denn der Großteil ist so tief drin das sie sich wahrscheinlich in ihrem Leben nie wieder vom Gegenteil überzeugen lassen.

Wenn die Videos dann vorbei sind und ich die Zahl der Aufrufe sehe, könnte ich oft im Strahl kotzen.

Also lots of the time in certain music scenes (but sometimes that's the same thing as being politically involved). Like in high school, around five years ago, I knew this dude who had the biggest flag I'd ever seen, a giant NSDAP swastika covering the wall of his room, put it on social media for everyone to see, even colour coded the laces on his docs (red, which is a really old school tactic people don't use anymore) to let everyone know his politics. All for the sake of emulating some older metal head groups who reveled in being inflammatory, making people feel unsafe, stirring the pot, etc. 

Point being it's not always a simple case of people creating a target in their head to be outraged at. Lots of people rail against Nazi wannabes because of their experiences, because they're a legitimate problem in many communities. What's sheltered is acting like that's impossible."

Don’t get me wrong, Biden did a good job as vp, but a medal/award is supposed to represent going massively above and beyond the expectations of a given posting. A vp receiving this on a presidents last day in office feels a lot like a lieutenant getting a bronze star as a deployment medal because if their rank despite doing nothing beyond what they would be expected to do. This post isn’t anti Biden, I’m just pointing out that in any case that a medal is awarded to someone it should ONLY be because they did something beyond what was expected of them. The list of recipients of this medal is for the most part a list of people receiving an award because of who they were socially/politically rather than doing anything that actually warranted it."

This is a thwowaway fow obvious weasons.

Some backgwound. Powiticawwy, I've been a Democwat my entiwe wife and an Obama suppowtew fow as wong as I can wemembew. I vowunteewed fow John Kewwy's pwesidentiaw campaign back in 2004 which is whewe fiwst wegistewed on my map. I watched his speech at the DNC was was instantwy enamouwed. 

When he announced his candidacy fow pwesident in 2007, immediatewy thwew my weight behind him. I knocked on doows, educated peopwe about his powicies and did the best I couwd to get peopwe to vote fow him. When he was ewected, I was ecstatic. In the past, when I had suppowted candidates, it was out of cowd weason; because I thought theiw powicies and acumen wouwd wesuwt in the best net wesuwt fow this countwy. But this was a pewson I couwd get excited about, someone I couwd *bewieve* in.

When it came time fow his campaign fow a second tewm it was wawgewy the same. I had swightwy souwed on him. Gwanted, he was not the pwesident I had hoped he wouwd be but that was not his fauwt. I had buiwt him up to be so huge in my head it was impossibwe fow him to wive up to expectations. Wepubwican gwidwock in Congwess awso pwevented him fwom getting thwough the powicies he wanted. Nevewthewess, I stiww suppowted him, stiww vowunteewed and was stiww happy when he won his second tewm.

The pwobwem stawted about thwee weeks ago. I had a dweam invowving Bawack, which is not uncommon fow me, I was wowking with him and Michewwe on theiw upcoming Netfwix show. We wewe wooking ovew demogwaphics and how they wewated to vawious geogwaphicaw wocations. Without even weawising it, I said ""Yeah, N***ew, we shouwd do pwetty weww in (awea neaw me)"" He just wooked at me and stowmed out with Michewwe behind him. I woke up and went into the bathwoom to spwash cowd watew in my face. I dismissed it. I don't have a wacist bone in my body. This was just one of those dweams, wight?

A week and a hawf ago, I had a simiwaw expewience. This time I dweamt we wewe going wine-tasting togethew. I don't wemembew the wead-up but I ended up saying something to the effect of ""The sommewiew said we shouwd be detecting eawthy tones in this wine, but it's just not wegistewing with me, N***ew"" This time, instead of stowming out he wepwied, vewy stewnwy ""Why did you feew that was an appwopwiate thing to say?"" I began to stuttew and expwain it was an accident but I had once again woken up.

The most wecent incident was wast night. I dweamt I was at a famiwy bawbecue with the Obamas, just his famiwy and mine. He was manning the gwiww and i was speaking to Michewwe whiwe the chiwdwen pwayed with each othew (I know Sasha and Mawia awe aduwts now but I stiww think of them as chiwdwen) I said to Michewwe vewy powitewy ""excuse me fow one moment"" and mawched wight up to Bawack and tapped him on the shouwdew. He tuwned awound to wook and me and I just said the wowd and nothing ewse. I can wwite off this happening once ow twice in my dweams but thwee sepawate events is too much.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to do this. Evewy time it happens my wowk suffews the next day. I've stawted wying to my wife saying I've been having nightmawes but I'm not suwe she fuwwy bewieves it. Watewy, I've been wowwying I might stawt saying it in my sweep and she couwd heaw. I'm at my wits end and I want it to stop."
1176,2020-04-20 13:28:48,g4srto,"I keep having dreams where I call Obama the N-word and I want it to stop

This is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

Some background. Politically, I've been a Democrat my entire life and an Obama supporter for as long as I can remember. I volunteered for John Kerry's presidential campaign back in 2004 which is where first registered on my map. I watched his speech at the DNC was was instantly enamoured. 

When he announced his candidacy for president in 2007, immediately threw my weight behind him. I knocked on doors, educated people about his policies and did the best I could to get people to vote for him. When he was elected, I was ecstatic. In the past, when I had supported candidates, it was out of cold reason; because I thought their policies and acumen would result in the best net result for this country. But this was a person I could get excited about, someone I could *believe* in.

When it came time for his campaign for a second term it was largely the same. I had slightly soured on him. Granted, he was not the president I had hoped he would be but that was not his fault. I had built him up to be so huge in my head it was impossible for him to live up to expectations. Republican gridlock in Congress also prevented him from getting through the policies he wanted. Nevertheless, I still supported him, still volunteered and was still happy when he won his second term.

The problem started about three weeks ago. I had a dream involving Barack, which is not uncommon for me, I was working with him and Michelle on their upcoming Netflix show. We were looking over demographics and how they related to various geographical locations. Without even realising it, I said ""Yeah, N***er, we should do pretty well in (area near me)"" He just looked at me and stormed out with Michelle behind him. I woke up and went into the bathroom to splash cold water in my face. I dismissed it. I don't have a racist bone in my body. This was just one of those dreams, right?

A week and a half ago, I had a similar experience. This time I dreamt we were going wine-tasting together. I don't remember the lead-up but I ended up saying something to the effect of ""The sommelier said we should be detecting earthy tones in this wine, but it's just not registering with me, N***er"" This time, instead of storming out he replied, very sternly ""Why did you feel that was an appropriate thing to say?"" I began to stutter and explain it was an accident but I had once again woken up.

The most recent incident was last night. I dreamt I was at a family barbecue with the Obamas, just his family and mine. He was manning the grill and i was speaking to Michelle while the children played with each other (I know Sasha and Malia are adults now but I still think of them as children) I said to Michelle very politely ""excuse me for one moment"" and marched right up to Barack and tapped him on the shoulder. He turned around to look and me and I just said the word and nothing else. I can write off this happening once or twice in my dreams but three separate events is too much.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to do this. Every time it happens my work suffers the next day. I've started lying to my wife saying I've been having nightmares but I'm not sure she fully believes it. Lately, I've been worrying I might start saying it in my sleep and she could hear. I'm at my wits end and I want it to stop."

In reality, the two droughts were pretty similar (and the Sox were probably better in between their championships) but the Cubs got into national media earlier and remain an effective blueblood for that reason.

Kind of like the Braves, actually--although it comes across more in the endless replaying of the 1992 NLCS than in over-discussion of a World Series or broken drought."

1213,2020-04-20 16:38:36,g4m6eq,"The attendance thing doesn’t surprise me, whether Cub fans want to admit it or not, the only reason Wrigley was always full during their garbage years was because it’s a tourist attraction. It’s not about some blind loyalty, or the “lovable losers” it’s because people want to see the park, that’s all. And in my opinion, the park is a bit of a shit hole, but it gets a pass because it’s old, surrounded by bars and has ivy on the outfield walls."

Based on factual history-- and does not try to make him more/less appealing outside of the focus here: queer issues. People of all political stripes stand behind the rainbow, and the endorsement as worded here comes solely off of it. We all have reasons much beyond just queer issues from which we derive our political choices, so the effort made in relevancy by sticking to those is admirable-- especially in today's extremely politically charged environment."
1226,2020-04-20 23:50:43,g4jdtk,I’m sorry but I will in no way vote for a rapist. Ever. I understand why you have endorsed and i get that these are scary times but I personally can’t bring myself to it

And especially so when there exists options like Green Party nominee Howie Hawkins, who are much more progressive with comparatively little baggage.

I know that you made this clear, but I just want to confirm that you definitely don’t speak for me, and you don’t speak for those of us in the community who refuse to support someone who stood against us for most of his life."
1230,2020-04-21 17:16:10,g4jdtk,Hi visitor that was linked from another site. Just want to remind everyone that bidens voting record has not been clean by any means. He has voted against womens and lgbtq rights in the past so he not incapable of doing it again. Yes he is better than trump in most ways but do not forget that politicians lie to get the nomination and change their policies during the presidential debates all the time. Watch him closely.
1231,2020-04-22 11:25:11,g4jdtk,"Uhhhhhh yes, one vote for the child sniffer please."
1232,2020-04-22 07:36:47,g4jdtk," Biden, while in Congress, voted in favor of Don’t Ask Don’t Tell (DADT) and the Defense of Marriage Act(DoMA). Saying he cares about the LBGT community is like saying a snake cares about a rabbit. Biden only supported gay rights because it was politically advantageous 

 Before you go on about the trans military ban that Trump imposed, I disagree with that act but banning transgender people is a lot discriminatory than banning gay marriage which Biden voted for with the DoMA. I am not always on board with Trump’s ideas even if I like some of what he’s pushing.

 Putting Biden in the White House is irresponsible and if you’re a Bernie supporter and you are voting for Biden. You’re voting for the Democratic establishments choke hold on their party and screwing over any chance you have of getting people you actually want into office.

 While I do agree he made a big fuck up with the trans military ban, he did ban transgenders because he has an innate hatred for trans people, no it’s because he made a mistake when looking at the numbers and when he wanted to cut down on sex changes the military had to perform. Trans people are more likely to have mental health issues and you can’t have a whole lot of mental health issues in the military, including suicidal thoughts. My friend was actually discharged for making a suicide joke. But about the one on sex changes, I think if Trump just stopped the military from performing sex changes, the outcome would be better.

 Before you ask, parts of this comment are preemptive so that I don’t have to explain myself in future comments. I know there will be some things that will be brought up but I don’t care rn, those were just the main ones.

Also yes I’m LGBT and yes I’m a zoomer.

What will really happen is, Trump will stack the courts even more, LGBT rights go into free fall, and Trump believes he can do anything with no consequences. Look what’s happening to trans people in Hungary - we’re next if Republicans have a House and Senate majority.

That means trans people legislated out of existence, gay marriage nullified and banned, more institutional oppression. Who are you going to run to to get these voted unconstitutional - the stacked courts?

If Trump wins, we won’t get a progressive candidate next time. We’ll get a candidate that is even further to the right than Biden, as Trump is pulling this country further to the right on a daily basis. It’s becoming increasingly harder to vote, and Progressive candidates will become non-viable anyways due to gerrymandering and voter oppression. 

The fire needs to be put out now. This Bernie or Bust argument is like saying we should let an increasingly raging fire burn down the town down and kill everyone inside so that people will take the fire department seriously next time. There may not be a next time."

And that decision is essentially between Biden and Trump. Because there's no way a third party candidate could win.

I'm not sure I'd trust the American people to make a sane decision between Trump and Biden. Especially after, you know, 2016 happened.

So I'd definitely vote Biden, no matter what he said about us 10 years ago. What he says today is much more important vs. what Trump says today.

Biden is racist. Might come as a shock since he was the VP for the first black president, but it leaks out from time to time. We especially saw this in the second to last debate where he went on about how black parents are uneducated and are the ones responsible for their child's failures in education, suggesting parents play records for their kids at night to solve the ""word gap"". It also came out when he stumbled on outlining different people, saying ""poor kids are just as talented as white kids -- wealthy kids, black kids, Asian kids..""

He does not get the healthcare situation at all. The Affordable Care Act has been a total bust. People are still having to go into debt to afford medications, surgeries, and cancer treatments. Wealthy insurance companies are still price gouging, pharmaceutical companies are price gouging even more, and hospitals have taken advantage of the opportunity as well. Not only that, but Republicans have shown that they can strip it down to nothing and are on track to completely eliminate it. In other words, for-profit healthcare has failed. We need a universal system that benefits all that is wholly regulated by the government, not by the rich. Trying to split the system only creates the opportunity for greed and power to override any progress, and becomes nothing more than virtue signaling.

Also, dedicating your life to public service absolutely does not make someone a good person. You might as well being a pastor makes you a good person. Just like religion, people will hold public service roles in order to gain wealth, fame, and/or power. They can use that position for their own benefits or the benefits of other horrible  people. I mean, Mitch Mcconnell has dedicated his life to public service, to the point where he is the longest serving US Senator, does that make him a good person?

Biden is not racist. He slips up when he speaks sometimes. That doesn't make him a racist. I can think of many examples disproving this bare lie, including his continued opposition to Apartheid South Africa early in his career. I honestly don't know how you can actually say he's racist with any sincerity. 

Actually, I think it's you that doesn't understand the health care system or the politics surrounding it. The ACA is not a disaster. It actually has helped tens of millions prior to Republicans trying to dismantle it at every turn. It can be fixed. The Medicare age can be lowered. We can even add a public option. These are all things Biden wants to do. I don't know what to tell you but you can't wave a magic wand and get M4A. It's just not politically feasible and you won't get elected if you campaign on it (as Bernie has proven). 

I take your point about public service. But when I say it, I don't just mean facially (like McConnell). I mean Biden has actually actively worked to make the lives of regular Americans of all races, sexualities, etc. better."

You fucking moron, that's not how it works. It's innocent until proven guilty, not the other way around. 

>Biden is racist. Might come as a shock since he was the VP for the first black president, but it leaks out from time to time. We especially saw this in the second to last debate where he went on about how black parents are uneducated and are the ones responsible for their child's failures in education, suggesting parents play records for their kids at night to solve the ""word gap"". It also came out when he stumbled on outlining different people, saying ""poor kids are just as talented as white kids -- wealthy kids, black kids, Asian kids..""

It's strange that a ""racist"" has overwhelming support among the black community, was chosen by the first black president, and is backed by the congressional black caucus. It seems like the people who are the victims of his supposed racism clearly disagree.

>He does not get the healthcare situation at all. The Affordable Care Act has been a total bust. People are still having to go into debt to afford medications, surgeries, and cancer treatments. Wealthy insurance companies are still price gouging, pharmaceutical companies are price gouging even more, and hospitals have taken advantage of the opportunity as well. Not only that, but Republicans have shown that they can strip it down to nothing and are on track to completely eliminate it. In other words, for-profit healthcare has failed. We need a universal system that benefits all that is wholly regulated by the government, not by the rich. Trying to split the system only creates the opportunity for greed and power to override any progress, and becomes nothing more than virtue signaling.

Biden wants a public option, which is a huge gain, and he wants to limit prescription drug prices. The ACA gave healthcare to 30 million people. People don't want to be forced to rely solely on the government for insurance.

>Also, dedicating your life to public service absolutely does not make someone a good person. You might as well being a pastor makes you a good person. Just like religion, people will hold public service roles in order to gain wealth, fame, and/or power. They can use that position for their own benefits or the benefits of other horrible people. I mean, Mitch Mcconnell has dedicated his life to public service, to the point where he is the longest serving US Senator, does that make him a good person? Yeah, I don't think that turtle has ever known what the words ""good person"" even means.

So true! For the sake of giving a more complete picture, let's also be clear about some things: The debate over marriage equality absent the bigotry was made into an issue of whether it should be left to the states or the federal government with the latter obviously being the only actual solution. Joe knew this at the time as did Democrats like Nancy Pelosi, who was consideres a liberal radical on this issue specifically! 

But I digress. What Biden said in that 2008 debate clip people pass around to criticise him actually vindicates claims in favor of his pro-lgbt cred. All he really says is they don't want to change the definition of marriage, but also that same sex unions should be legal on the federal level. Talking about ""the definition of marriage"" is problematic for many young people because it's kinf of a right wing thing, but liberals used it as a shibboleth and a qualifier when supporting legalization. It really is that simple."

Frankly, that's too late and I am not convinced it's genuine and not just a ploy. If he wanted my trust, he should've been consistent way before that. He didn't support gay marriage because it wasn't convenient, and if it becomes inconvenient again, who's to say he won't go back on that?

Ah yes, the old ""I'm older so I know better."" I'm 17, and while I frankly don't have that much experience with the world, I have a pretty good head on my shoulders. Of course I understand that many conservatives still want to overturn Obergefell and make sure that the rights equivalent doesn't happen. The thing is that rights are in large part tied to money because that's the nature of capitalism. As long as health care is tied to employment, people can lose their health care for being gay or trans. I'm not a single-issue voter, and even if I were to say Biden's queer rights record is wonderful (which it isn't), I'd rather vote for someone who will improve the lives of people other than queer people as well as helping queer people.

>I'm old enough to know that not choosing the lesser evil is undeniably evil, because it's allowing greater evil to occur out of some misguided sense of moral superiority.

But it turns out that the people who wanted a revolution couldn't be assed to leave their houses and vote for it. Or were to young.

First of all, take into account how the Electoral College works. I'm from Maryland, and that'll get carried by Biden easily. Also my vote wouldn't really matter unless I had influence over a large number of people or if it would otherwise be tied, and neither of those is happening. Also I find it highly unlikely that generations of trans people would lose their rights. I'd also like to point out that M4A covers medical transition-related things.  As for the bit about people wanting a revolution not voting, take a second to consider that a lot of those people couldn't vote because they were working or in more recent cases because of COVID-19. Older people are more conservative and also have a higher probability of being retired and thus have more time on their hands. Election day needs to be made a national holiday.

This was mostly centered around queer rights, but there are so many more issues I have with Biden. Frankly, I'm not even convinced it's best for the US for Biden to win because maybe if another centrist loses the dems will nominate somebody with a chance for once (though the DNC probably won't since neolibs would rather work with fascists than socialists.)"

That aside, I don’t understand how you’re sacrificing your principles by voting for the person who will cause significantly less harm.

Let’s ask this:

Do you think it will be easier for a more progressive government to come following 4 years of Biden or four more years of Trump?

If nothing else, do you think that a 7-2 Conservative Supreme Court is better to contend with to making progress? How do we create any positive policy changes going up against that?"

He's for a public option. He's very much against single payer. Even if we elected Bernie or Warren, we already lost that policy battle in the Senate.

I want M4A to become law but we're not going to get there with our eyes closed.

We can still get a public option in 2020. And while that doesn't save as many lives and as many bankruptcies as M4A, it does save tens of thousands. And it puts more people on government plans which will make it easier to move to M4A in the future. And it drastically increases the chance of a liberal court which will uphold progressive healthcare laws. If Trump wins, not only do we lose the public option in the short term, we lose M4A in the long term. The current 5-4 GOP court found Medicaid expansion unconstitutional. Imagine what a 7-2 court will do to M4A.

When the vast majority of the country was opposed to gay marriage unless you were in an ultra-liberal district it was a political death sentence to support gay marriage. You would never have the opportunity to effect positive change ever again. This is how the real world is. Bernie also did not support gay marriage for many years when he was in office. Because he was smart. He had way more to do in politics and getting booted out for taking a stand on gay marriage would help zero people. 

Biden's position before openly supporting gay marriage was civil equality with all the same rights for LGBTQ people, which was an improvement on the system at the time. When the people moved towards that position then he moved farther left and supported gay marriage. Thats how an efficacious politician works. 

> I'm not a single-issue voter, and even if I were to say Biden's queer rights record is wonderful (which it isn't), I'd rather vote for someone who will improve the lives of people other than queer people as well as helping queer people.

The election is between Biden and Trump. Not anyone else. Biden's healthcare plan would cover 40 million more people than Trump's plan. Its not M4A, but its a massive improvement and has the added benefit of having a chance of passing. If Biden doesn't win then Trump wins, thats the electoral system that we have and refusing to participate doesn't hurt the system, it just helps Trump. 

>This was mostly centered around queer rights, but there are so many more issues I have with Biden. Frankly, I'm not even convinced it's best for the US for Biden to win because maybe if another centrist loses the dems will nominate somebody with a chance for once (though the DNC probably won't since neolibs would rather work with fascists than socialists.)

Thats what some people said in 2016. Bernie lost by an even larger margin. People aren't going to vote for someone who is pushing for radical change when you have Trump in the white house. People generally want to vote for the opposite of the current system when its unpopular. A chaotic Trump presidency will be countered with a stable normal democrat. Progressives will only have a shot when we have a status quo leader and the systemic problems persist. Trump covers for all the systemic issues because people can pin the problems with the system on his atrocious rule.

**c)** Story boosted by a fringe pro-Putin pro-Bernie website (The Intercept)

**d)** story completely unvetted and unsubstantiated by real media

Maybe because it's a crime to file a false report? 

For more, please read the following about Reade:

* She claims to have been blacklisted because of her complaint. She worked in DC multiple times afterwards.
* She says, specifically, for some reason, that she had bare legs when it happened. Ever woman working in the Senate in 1993 had to wear hose at the time.
* A year ago, she was claiming that it was the work environment that made her uncomfortable, going so far as to say that she wasn't even sure that Biden knew who she was. The ""he sexually assaulted me"" is the third iteration of this story in the past year, none of which existed or were mentioned beforehand.
* She gave newspapers five anonymous sources to contact about the story to corroborate that she told them about it at the time. Unfortunately, three of them said they didn't remember her mentioning anything at all. One of them vaguely remembered her saying the work environment was bad, but that she never referred to Biden. The other says she mentioned something related to an incident much later.
* In 2017, she was saying ""My old boss speaks truth. Listen."" with zero prompting.
* Also in 2017, she was praising Biden for his work in speaking out against sexual assault. It would be strange to lie about her feelings towards that given she hadn't worked with nor had contact with him for more than two decades.
* This isn't a lie necessarily, but she sued one of her former employers over discriminating against her for ""being too white"".
* Also not a lie, but she claimed to be in love with Vladimir Putin?
* She made multiple weird and melodramatic ""tic toc"" tweets and kept mentioning timing, which is also really weird for the victim of sexual assault to gleefully revel in
* At one point she claimed to have had to move because of the blowback she faced from reporting the allegation, but she previously said she moved because she needed to go to Russia to study for a novel she was writing, which is a really weird contradiction.
* The complaint she claims to have made doesn't exist and there's no record of it existing anywhere. The people who would have had this reported to them never received a complaint from her, but other women interviewed who worked for Biden said that his organization was really good in dealing with harassment claims

Sanders voted for the same Crime Bill, he had a tough on crime website even in the early 2000s, he was anti-immigration and had a very lax history of gun control, even voting against the Brady Act 5 separate times. He voted for several wars including Afghanistan and Libya... and When he ran for president, that all changed. Because he had a platform and opinions, and some of it was for PR and some of it was because he actually felt differently ten years later.

People evolve. There are things I don't like about Biden. I do not believe he is a great defender of womens rights, but I do believe he will keep Roe v Wade which is the firewall that must not fall. I do not believe he is as progressive on criminal justice as we need him to be, but holding against what literally every single politician including Sanders did in the 1990s (including the entire black Caucus who were heavily pushing it) when crime was going out of control is terrible.

I do know he he has been advocating for better healthcare since the early 2000s. He's been doing the same for increased minimum wage and college. A lot of criticisms you are throwing are more apt to Obama and Clinton: [Biden was viewed as the dove in the Obama administration and fought with Clinton numerous times](https://www.vox.com/2015/8/4/9094341/Biden-dove-Hillary-hawk).

>	1991: Voted against authorising the Gulf War.

Wow, he voted against *one* imperialist war! That’s a... very high bar. 

[Here’s a pretty thorough record](https://www.ontheissues.org/2020/Joe_Biden_War_+_Peace.htm) of Biden’s stance on the American imperialist war machine. Of note are the facts that he:

-	Championed the Iraq War.

-	Endorsed full-scale nation-building in Afghanistan.

-	Championed the Bush Administration’s ability to go to war without U.N. approval.

-	Beat the war drums on regime change in Syria

-	[Sided with Trump to back the failed coup in Venezuela](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/05/01/biden-sides-trump-bolton-and-pompeo-backing-coup-effort-venezuela)

>	Spearheaded the Federal Assault Weapons Ban

Yay, carceral solutions to gun violence! Those have totally worked in the past. At the very least you could have cited Biden’s support for an Australian-style gun buyback program instead, which actually would be a good thing that works if we could trust that he’s not just lying about it for votes.

>	and the Violence Against Women Act.

That one I agree with, at least, but let’s also note that one of the VAWA’s other backers was [Republican and anti-abortion, anti-woman activist Orrin Hatch](https://time.com/5675029/violence-against-women-act-history-biden/). Clearly supporting the VAWA doesn’t automatically make one a feminist ally.

Awesome! Too bad he [helped create the student loan debt crisis](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/02/joe-biden-student-loan-debt-2005-act-2020) a mere five years later. 

>	Not to mention all the good he did in the Obama administration (including being the one to convince Obama that same-sex marriage should be legalized on a federal level).

Same-sex marriage was an important victory, but it also obfuscates the fact that the struggle for queer rights is intersectional with the struggle against so many of the things that Joe Biden supports: for-profit healthcare, the American imperialist war machine and the movement toward economic justice, to name a few.

[citation needed]

Because only progressives can act like spoiled children, aka stay home on election day because they didn't get their way?

More importantly, if we had 8 years of Bernie and then nominated someone even further left, do you think all the moderate democrats would turn out for that person?  

Obviously no.  And there are a lot more moderates than Bernie supporters.  This petulant, entitled attitude on the left that the party should cater to a loud minority within the minority that is the Democratic Party simply *because* they're so loud is absolutely fucking infuriating."

>	The official Florida tally gave Bush the win by 537 votes (48.847 percent to 48.838 percent), while Nader racked up 97,488 votes. The national exit poll asked respondents how they would vote in a two-person race between Bush and Gore. Political scientist Gerald Pomper summed up the results in a 2001 Political Science Quarterly overview: “approximately half (47 percent) of the Nader voters said they would choose Gore in a two-man race, a fifth (21 percent) would choose Bush, and a third (32 percent) would not vote. Applying these figures to the actual vote, Gore would have achieved a net gain of 26,000 votes in Florida, far more than needed to carry the state easily.”

And if the hundreds of thousands of Democratic voters who *voted for Bush* in Florida has come around to Gore instead, it would have been a landslide. But somehow I never see people like you blaming *them.* 

Hmm, I wonder why... perhaps it has something to do with the fact that you’d rather browbeat the left than come to grips with the realities of how to actually win elections?

When the majority of your electorate is one certain ideology, it's better to go for that group than any other. Especially trying to appeal to the far left/young crowd who by and large don't even vote anyways. 

And it's somewhat ignorant to peddle either Hillary or Biden as not being progressive. Both are arguably the two most progressive Democratic presidential nominees ever.

It is easier to build a leftist coalition, and towards a leftist future, with a Biden presidency than with a Trump presidency; and it is significantly preferable that we prevent a 7-2 Supreme Court, which we can only ensure if we vote for Biden."
1547,2020-04-20 03:57:38,g4jdtk,"> So long as the political and economic system remains intact, voter enfranchisement, though perhaps resisted by overt white supremacists, is still welcomed so long as nothing about the overall political arrangement fundamentally changes. The facade of political equality can occur under violent occupation, but liberation cannot be found in the occupier’s ballot box. In the context of settler colonialism voting is the “civic duty” of maintaining our own oppression. It is intrinsically bound to a strategy of extinguishing our cultural identities and autonomy.

I agree with this, and this is the broader point of the article. 

What I’m not seeing - and what I don’t understand - is how it’s easier for us to build a system *beyond* our current political system with a fascist as president and a 7-2 conservative Supreme Court. 

The system is broken and needs to change."

1549,2020-04-20 04:06:35,g4jdtk,"A handful, yes, though generally speaking I’m not highly active on that side of Reddit because I have run into conflict in the past, and I just don’t find much of online leftists that appealing to interact with. 

That said, I’m pretty familiar with anarchism *beyond* Reddit. 

I like Goldman, though she’s staunchly opposed you voting in all contexts. (It’s important to note that I’m not arguing to vote as a means of achieving anarchism; I’m arguing to vote as a means of achieving the least-antagonistic government possible. When the choice is fascism or neoliberal rule, fascism will make it significantly harder to build to a leftist system.) 

Bakunin, on the other hand, does argue for instances where voting and electoral politics can be useful. Speaking about he necessity of voting, in a letter to Italian anarchist Gambuzzi, he wrote:

> Second, times have become so grave, the danger menacing the liberty of all countries so formidable, that all mean of goodwill must step into the breach, and especially our friends, who must be in a position to exercise the greatest possible influence on events.

And though not strictly an *anarchist philosopher*, Le Guin’s *The Dispossessed* is probably the most formative book I’ve read wrt my political views. 

I guess, with all of this, I mean to say that there’s a wide world of politics, and anarchism, and political philosophy, outside of Reddit, and I don’t really care what a random redditor on r/Anarchy101 thinks about this election, or a random writer on Medium.

(With that said, the indigenous article is a really great perspective and I appreciate it. The thing, again, is that I don’t disagree with criticisms that bourgeois democratic practices perpetuate harmful notions and further oppression; I disagree that voting isn’t worthwhile, when the threat of four more years of Trump makes it significantly harder to organize for a bright future, *and ensures the present will be even worse.*)

I don’t mean to sound overly aggressive; I’m sorry for some of the things I’ve said in reply to you, I got heated at moments I shouldn’t have."

1576,2020-04-20 01:33:41,g4eur5,"As a teen of the 2000s I agree that the 2000s was far more fast paced than the 2010s were, 
2000-01 was still the 90s culturally while 2008-09 was like the early 2010s with 2002-07 being the core years as it were.

No two years in the 00s were the same where as I kinda see the 10s as two blobs: 2010-2014 and 2015-2019, I think the 10s is like the 70s, the hangover period between two big, ever changing, wild decades, 

The thing with the 10s is that it never had a global-wide generational defining moment like how 9/11 defined the 00s or how Covid-19 will come to define the 20s, the 10s was just there in many ways 

The 10s struggled to find an identity yet it’s culture was basically rehashing things from the 80s thru to the 00s, in the early 00s we weren’t looking back to the early 90s and when we did, it was more of a case of “Jesus how was Hammer Time, do the Bart man and fresh prince even popular back then” it was more cringe than actual nostalgia, yet in early 10s there was already a nostalgic look back to the early 00s.

 Find this a lot with odd numbered decades (30s,50s,70s,90s,10s) that with the exception of the the 50s and 90s the odd numbered decades spend half the decade recovering from the preceding even numbered decade and the next half simply preparing for the next decade to come, the 70s is the awkward middle sibling to the swinging 60s and the nihilistic 80s for example.

I think that’s why the tens seemed much slower than preceding decades."
1577,2020-04-20 02:35:36,g4eur5,"The things is the 90s didn’t *really* end until about 2003-2004.

However, I think what they both had in common was the sense of things changing so fast and I think that is a big '2000s' feeling. It doesn't feel the same 2010-2020, like we had a lot of new 'stuff' but it didn't have that feeling of really pushing the envelope. In that sense, I think 2000 and 2009 were quite similar. Really, even 2000 and 2005 were very different in terms of things like the ubiquity of mobiles and the fashions and things like that, but similar in that sense of the pace of change."

All those points you mentioned regarding the year 2000 also apply to most of 2003. As for August to December of that year social media existed (MySpace) but was not popular at all.

As far as fashion is concerned, many trends that were popular in 1998 were also popular in 2003. These include: frosted tips, soul patch goatees, chained wallets, studded belts, low-rise pants, glittery makeup, puka shell necklaces, faux-leather pants, Oakleys sunglasses, and T-shirt over long sleeves. You still saw curtained hair here and there (none after \~early 2004). The skater/Bieber hair existed throughout 1998-2003 but wasn't at all mainstream (certainly nothing like 2006-13 or even late 2004-05). Chunky highlights and whale tails arrived somewhat later (circa \~2000) and both survived well into the mid 2000s but certainly died by late 2008 alongside low-rise pants. Except for faux-leather pants, glittery makeup and puka shell necklaces the other aforementioned trends were popular in 2004 but emo also really started to gain traction that year as did the skater look. Late 2004 had a noticeably different vibe from late 2003 and it's not just fashion.

The fashion of 2010 and 2019 aren't all that different. There's a surplus of beards and the skater/Bieber hair has been replaced by man buns and that permed bowl cut. Also scene is dead (but this is irrelevant when it comes to non-teens and non-tweens). But that's it."

1597,2020-04-20 06:54:11,g4eur5,Honestly I'm very excited to experience this transition
1598,2020-04-20 07:24:02,g4eur5,"> No two years in the 00s were the same 

I think that's the defining feature of the 2000s. It was that feeling of a lot of progression, very fast."
1599,2020-04-23 04:38:43,g4eur5,"Nah I disagree. I honestly think the time period in which you were a teenager seems the most eventful. I think the 2010s have a distinct identity with meme culture and everything but that’s because I was a teen most of the decade so I was very in touch with pop culture. Now I feel the same, things are starting to blur together and the world seems more boring. I think it’s just a part of getting older."
1600,2020-05-18 01:28:07,g4eur5,"> nihilistic 80s

90s were nihilistic

80s were hi nrg"
1601,2020-06-16 05:05:24,g4eur5,"Agreed! 2003 still felt very (late) 90s and felt much more like 1998 than 2008 despite being chronologically equidistant between both years. VCRs were still commonly used in 2003. From from January to mid June of that year VHS rental surpassed DVD. Dial-up internet was considerably more popular than broadband and for most of the year social media was essentially non-existent. MySpace arrived in August but during that month as well as late 2003 it wasn't popular at all. I'd like to say that MySpace became popular around late 2004 (this was also when the 90s ended and the core 2000s were in full swing) and remained so until 2008.

Many shows that began sometime in the 90s (decade) were still airing new episodes in 2003. These include Dawson's Creek, Friends, Frasier, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Sabrina the Teenage Witch. For the large majority of the year, Misty was still featured in Pokemon like she was in 1998. From 1999-2003 Digimon aired new episodes and seasons consecutively (no years skipped). They made a comeback with Data Squad in 2007, but this was **4** years after Digimon's 4th season ended and had a very different vibe even from that iteration.

Most cell phones sold and shipped had monochrome displays and no cameras just like in 1998. Windows XP was around back in 2003 but Windows 2000 (and ME) had far larger market shares. Windows 95 and 98 users were still not uncommon at all. Dell sold computers with floppy disk drives by default until February of that year. The original iMacs initially released in 1998 but remained sold and supported until 2003. PS1 games were still being made and sold. iPods were around but the DiscMan still outsold them. I can go on and on but I'll stop here."
1602,2020-04-20 02:46:53,g4eur5,"Lol so you think the 00s barely had an identity?










And why do you say the 90s didn't end until 2003-04? You wouldn't say the 90s ended with 9/11?"
1603,2020-04-20 00:12:35,g4eur5,"I agree completely. I graduated in 2012 and claimed that our high school years shared more similarities to the class of 2020 than 2004 due to the technological advancements made over the course of the 2000s. Obviously I know that they were distinctly different from both graduating classes, but someone was arguing with me that the teen experience in 2008-2012 was more similar to 2000-2004 than 2016-2020 which sounded pretty ridiculous to me considering I know people who graduated in 2004 and many didn’t have cell phones until their junior or senior year, many didn’t have them period. Also social media was pretty non existent. MySpace had debuted the year before but it didn’t really start gaining traction until the 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 school years. Ipods had yet to outsell CD players, online gaming had yet to reach popularity and we were still in the Web 1.0 era. The 2008-2009 school year was hands down more similar to 2000-2004 but by late 2009, the early 2010s were in full effect which were definitely more similar to the late 2010s than to the early 2000s. Teens today have mostly what I had in high school besides streaming, but  on steroids."
1604,2020-06-16 05:10:29,g4eur5,Even 2003 felt quite different from 2009. I honestly think it has more in common with 1997 despite being chronologically equidistant from both 1997 and 2009.
1605,2020-04-20 04:43:03,g4eur5,"Which proves my point even more! Lol.








And I'm sure that every other past decade was like this too, where the first year was drastically different than the last year (e.g. 1990 and 1999, 1980 and 1989, etc.)."
1606,2020-06-16 05:18:25,g4eur5,2003 still felt late 90s to me. 2004 is another story (especially late 2004).
1607,2020-04-20 06:23:41,g4eur5,"""Crank Dat"" is a VERY 2000s song imo. 2007 was the last year that felt authentically 00s to me."
1608,2020-06-16 05:14:45,g4eur5,I remember back in high school the 'scene' subculture was huge. This was in the late 2000s early 2010s. The last time I personally saw 'scene' kids was 2014.
1609,2020-04-20 08:36:06,g4eur5,"I don't miss scene culture. It was cringeworthy to me as a kid and still is. I don't know why, but it just is."
1610,2020-05-04 19:14:13,g4eur5,"Yeah it's crazy. That's why some people don't think that the 2000s had an identity. Things were changing SO rapidly within that one decade. On the contrary, the 2010s, while still way more technologically advanced and different than the 2000s, felt like the most stagnant decade in modern history. We haven't really changed much in culture since 2015 I'd say. I guess once technology advances so rapidly, it makes the years seem stagnant with very little change. 🙍"
1611,2020-08-03 06:32:42,g4eur5,"03-07 were the core 00s years, hands down. Before those years (00-02) were an extension of the 90s, while the late 00s (08-09) were a prelude to the 2010s."
1612,2020-08-26 00:53:17,g4eur5,"Yup! And late 2010s/early 2020s (2018~2021ish) will be its own era too! I feel like 2022 will be the definite start of the 2020s, because by then the coronavirus pandemic will likely be over, but of course we won't know yet."
1613,2020-06-15 01:11:23,g4eur5,What? Twitter came out in early 2006
1614,2020-06-16 06:49:03,g4eur5,"Hello again! I don't really remember the early 00s since I was born in 99. But I do remember that by the 2004-05 school year (the same year I started Kindergarten) the core 2000s were in full-effect. I would say that the core 00s feel lasted up to the 2007-08 school year. 








Now imo, the 2008-09 school year did have a lot of 00s characteristics, although we started shifting into the 2010s. Late 2009 was when the early 2010s vibe started. Really 2008-2011 was the shift period between the 2000s and 2010s. 








Early 2012 still had a tad bit of 00s influence, but late 2012 was when the 00s culture started to really fade away. Also, I remember that electropop was really popular from late 2008-mid 2013. By late 2013 electropop was ""dead"", and everything 00s was gone. Really the whole year of 2013 felt very 2010s, and it was definitely the first core 10s year.








Now as for the 2010s, I would say the core years would be 2013-2015, maybe even early 2016. Obviously the 2016 presidential election started the late 2010s feel.








Now I've noticed that TikTok has been very popular since it was introduced to the US in August 2018. I feel like the app is really changing the Internet and social media in general. Therefore, I feel like 2018-2019 have some 2020s characteristics, but it's still too early to tell of course. The current Covid-19 pandemic is definitely starting a new era, and I feel like 2021 could be the year that the 2020s decade gets an identity. So maybe 2018-2021 will be a transition period between the 10s and 20s. But again, it's too early to tell."
1615,2020-07-12 05:18:57,g4eur5,"I am super late to this convo lmao, but to your last part, today's eboys and egirls are basically TikTokized scene kids. I know because most of my friends are them, lol"
1616,2020-06-24 09:35:28,g4eur5,Why do you say that?
1617,2020-07-08 22:25:24,g4eur5,I know that late 2009 was. The 2008-09 school year was a transition from the core 00s to the early 10s.

No.

tiktok is just Vine 2.0"
1620,2020-06-17 15:54:37,g4eur5,"2020s will have humungous amounts of chances, in no way 2018-2019 are fit to serve as preludes for what is yet to come, by 2029 the world will be radically diferent"

1622,2020-04-20 10:40:41,g4eur5,"It was very fast, 2000 was still very much the 90s but by 2002/03 so much had already changed"
1623,2020-04-28 04:16:51,g4eur5,"Pretty neat, and yes, it's true that the UK is more racist towards east Asians compared to the States, partly because the east Asian population is much lower in UK. Asians living in the States are typically much happier than their counterparts in the UK as they don't have to deal with the kind of racism and ignorance that exists in the UK."
1624,2020-04-20 02:48:40,g4eur5,"Oh no, they definitely had an identity, they just didn’t have very much time with it. 2010s were kind of the era of cells phones, which started in 09, and 90s culture kind of mixed with 2000s culture for a few years. 2000s was a great decade with a strong identity, it just had to share some time with 90s leftovers and early 2010s culture."
1625,2020-05-18 01:32:49,g4eur5,Not all decades
1626,2020-06-16 17:57:24,g4eur5,In what ways?
1627,2020-04-20 08:31:10,g4eur5,I would say 2008. It was right on the edge of the 2009 era but still had most of the 2005-2007 stuff
1628,2020-04-20 20:48:18,g4eur5,"For me, I enjoyed it but mocked it at the same time, and that’s still how it is for me lol"
1629,2020-05-04 19:31:50,g4eur5,That's a fair point to make
1630,2020-06-15 06:52:36,g4eur5,My bad
1631,2020-06-16 17:51:40,g4eur5,"I'm a little older (born early '94), so I vividly remember the early 2000s (as well as '98-'99). Indeed, the core 2000s were in full swing by the 2004-2005 school year and remained so until the 2007-2008 one. Early to mid 2004 felt mostly core 2000s but with a fair amount late 90s leftovers including those fashion trends I mentioned as well as dial-up still being more popular than broadband and social media (MySpace) not quite popular yet. It's the transitional period from the Y2K Era (1998-2003) to the core 2000s (late 2004 - mid 2008). Mid to late 1997 would be the transitional period from the Core 90s (1993 - early 1997?) to the Y2K Era.

The 2008-09 school year did have lots of 00s characteristics. Following the release of the iPhone App Store as well as the very first Android, smartphones became a thing. However they wouldn't be ubiquitous until the 2012-13 school year. TV broadcast was still done in analog. No Windows 7 yet. The PS2 was still quite popular. MySpace was still a thing. And so on. 

But there were also a significant amount of 2010s characteristics. Low-rise jeans and whale tails died, Facebook overtook MySpace in popularity, Electropop music became popular (much more of an early 2010s thing but still), and as mentioned smartphones became a thing. The list goes on but I'll stop here.

2013 had some core 2000s leftovers but not very many. I'd like to say mainly the 'scene' subculture (which became popular around 2007) and the Bieber/skater hair (became popular ~2006). Electropop music was popular throughout the year but yes late 2013 (around the time hipsters and Snapchat really started to gain traction) less so. By 2014 Electropop was essentially dead with 'scene' and the Bieber/skater hair being much less popular. 2013 felt mainly 2010s indeed. I'd say late 2013 - mid 2016 would be the core 2010s period. Regarding the late 2010s and when the 2020s gets an identity we can't know yet."
1632,2020-07-12 05:34:51,g4eur5,"No worries about the late response. The last few days I did hear and read about the Eboys and Egirls (my younger sister introduced me to those terms). They look somewhat similar to the scene kids of the early 2010s. Never met one personally, but then again I was born '94 so people around my age are slightly too old for that subculture. The fashion of 2010 and 2019 aren't all that different at all. Just mainly a surplus of beards and the skater/Bieber hair being replaced by man buns and permed bowl cuts as mentioned."
1633,2020-06-24 10:46:26,g4eur5,i kinda agree with jackinator94
1634,2020-04-20 04:45:32,g4eur5,"But TikTok has played an immensive part in people's lives, especially teenagers. And yes, TikTok is a sequel to music.ly or whatever it was called. But I really feel like TikTok is really changing the social media game right now, more than music.ly ever did. And TikTok blew up in late 2018. I think Lil Nas X was the first artist to become a mainstream celebrity from TikTok in 2019. Sure Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have changed our lives too, but for the most part I consider those 2010s apps. That's not to say that they won't remain prevalent in the 2020s, because I'm sure that they definitely will."
1635,2020-05-18 02:12:16,g4eur5,Vine didn't impact people's lives as much tho.
1636,2020-06-17 19:11:41,g4eur5,"Then again, it's too early to tell. I'm sure that 2021 will see a huge shift into actual 2020s culture. But usually years that end with an 8-9 plant the seeds for the next decade while still remaining very much like the current decade. I personally feel like TikTok is changing the social media world. 2018-19 are still very 2010s years, but they have just a few 2020s characteristics. But yes, Covid-19 is really gonna shift us into 2020s culture."
1637,2020-04-20 07:29:58,g4eur5,"Idk I'm starting to feel a little bit of a transition. The other day I saw a commercial where a woman was making her elderly father dinner, she just bare handed all the ingredients into the pot and then brushed the remains off her hands into the pot and my immediate reaction was ""WHAT IS SHE DOING!! She's trying to KILL him!""

The more substantial changes probably will take a little longer though, you're right. I think self care, sick days, and working from home are about to become much more welcome and encouraged in our society though."
1638,2020-04-20 02:51:57,g4eur5,"Lol I think many people would disagree that the 00s were a great decade. I grew up in the 00s so of course I'm gonna say that they were great. Are you not American? Because the 00s were a little bit of a tragedy for us. I mean, yeah it was a fun decade, but I think many people overlook the bad stuff that happened, like 9/11, Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina, and the Great Recession."

Windows XP was significantly more popular than in late 2003. Majority of cell phones sold and shipped in late 2004 had both color displays and cameras (including the iconic Moto RAZR).

I can go on and on but I'll stop here."
1640,2020-04-20 08:38:22,g4eur5,"Early and mid-2008 were definitely 00s. But in late 2008, we had the Great Recession start and Obama getting elected as president. Late 2008 was the birth of 2010s culture."

1644,2020-04-20 02:57:28,g4eur5,"I was very young for most of the 00s, and an American. Of course I’ll think it’s good cause I grew up during that time, but based on what I’ve seen older people say the overall culture and feel of the 00s was good, ESPECIALLY early internet culture. Sure we had 9/11 and the Iraq war, which were bad, but the feel of the 00s was still mostly good"
1645,2020-06-17 08:33:25,g4eur5,"Maybe in technology, but in terms of fashion, music and politics, 03 was a lot less late 90s. A lot of late 90s fashion trends such as curtained hair, frosted tips, and those big round glasses were dead by '03. Musically, southern hip hop and crunk began rapidly rising in popularity, as well as emo. And as you mentioned, nu metal was dying out and giving rise to metalcore. Finally, in '03, terrorism was much more of a hot-button issue and it's when the Iraq war started."

1649,2020-04-20 03:20:39,g4eur5,"Lol I find that funny. Because I remember everyone saying that the 00s were a terrible decade, but once the 2010s were almost over, the 00s looked amazing and the 10s were the terrible decade. I'm sure that halfway through the 2020s we'll say that the 20s are a horrible decade and the 10s were amazing!"
1650,2020-06-17 20:26:38,g4eur5,"Maybe the big round glasses were dead by '03. And admittedly whale tails and chunky highlights were 2000s trends and low rise jeans more 2000s than late 90s, but many trends that became popular in the late 90s (e.g. chained wallets, studded belts, frosted tips, T-shirt over long sleeves and puka shell necklaces) were still prevalent that year in varying degrees depending on the region/place.

Yes, frosted tips were actually far from dead in '03. Many bands active back then such as O-Town, Blink 182, Sum 41, New Found Glory, Simple Plan, B4-4, Smash Mouth, Sugar Ray, Linkin Park, etc had at least one member with frosted tips for some or all of the year. Actors such as Justin Berfield (Reese from Malcolm in the Middle) and Bobby Edner (Francis from Spy Kids 3-D Game Over) had them too. Lastly, many athletes including at least half the top prospects for the 2003 NHL Draft frosted their tips. They were noticeably less popular in '04 but were still a thing that year.

I'll agree that curtained hair wasn't very common in '03. It was primarily a mid 90s to very early 2000s trend.

Yes, crunk rose in popularity though it wouldn't be mainstream until '04. I noticed some of emo in '03 though it was much less prevalent than say late '04 (around the time MySpace became popular) to '07. Pop punk was alive and well. '03 was the final year Nu Metal was popular. It wasn't popular at all in '04. Metalcore and Alternative Metal overtook Nu Metal in popularity. 

I'll accept that politically '03 was quite 2000s. It was much less optimistic than '98-mid '01 (pre-9/11) and as you mentioned the Iraq war started that year."

What needs to be had is a split in the parties, where moderate Republicans and Democrats split from the more fundamentalist and progressive sections in their respective parties. Otherwise, American politics will continue to be polarised and will continue to stagnate, making people more vulnerable to propaganda from both internal and external sources."
1686,2020-04-19 15:09:00,g48wp6,"Sure some skepticism is natural. But this sounds like scare tactics. Voters are individuals, not groups that all believe the same thing. Shouldn’t we at least listen to ideas that could benefit the majority of taxpayers?"

It's maddening because it's the very definition of letting ""the perfect be the enemy of the good."". It's counterproductive and gives ammunition to Trump.

That being said, if Dems want to beat Trump, they're going to need as big a coalition as possible, so that means not totally alienating the Far-Left.  Biden will have to adopt some of that platform (something Bernie and his supporters weren't willing to do, I might mention) to keep enough of them from staying home, voting Green or even Trump out of spite."

Further more, calling those candidates socialist only makes you seem like a far right wing bat and pisses that base off even more and creates more divide. 

There are some very staunch Bernie or bust people on reddit. However, I think this reflects a voting base that is fed up with two elections in a row of having to pick between the worst of two evils. I think it’s ridiculous someone would stay at home because their top choice loss, but that’s each persons right. 

Like others have said I think we are starting to FINALLY see a shift from a two party system, because democrats and democratic socialists really don’t belong in the same party. DemSocs now have to settle for Biden even though they can’t identify with either candidate."

This isn't new, though, as even the Marxists in the last days of the Weimar Republic viewed the social democrats and centrists with more contempt than they did  the fascists.  Fun fact:  the Left requires dogmatic adherence to their time-honored tradition of cutting off their nose to spite their face! 

Nonetheless, I would respectfully dispute

>conventional wisdom among Democrats is that the Socialists must be coddled and placated

I assume you're talking about, in general, Biden taking on any given number of Sanders' issues of interest or policy positions following Sanders' endorsement.  That's hardly coddling or placating, but rather recognizing and respecting the practical implications of a sizable plurality of a party's voters backing a candidate who isn't the winner.  Although technically that may fit the definition of ""placating,"" it certainly is not a negative thing as you describe it here.  

And I would that, with respect to

> claiming they ""won the ideological battle""

although they certainly didn't ""win"" much, they should in fact take some pride in and be energized by the ideological victories Bernie Sanders did achieve.  Various topics, such as Medicare for All or bold action on climate change, eg., the Green New Deal, were barely registering as recently as 2016, let alone before, whereas today the concepts, if not the particular policy proposals themselves as they currently exist, are essentially ""household names.""  I think that's a good thing, although it hardly means they won some sort of intra-party battle which Biden needs to kow tow to now.  

Finally,

Why do you say that as if this is some sort of recurring phenomenon?"

Unfortunately both these groups while fringe extremists, are large enough to turn the election if they stay at home.    So both parties at least need to cater to each group enough to get them out to vote, while not being public enough about it to scare off the vast majority of Americans who find each group enormously distasteful."

If you look at r/OurPresident, they have just as much respect for Biden as they do for Trump - they call Biden racist, a rapist and other things. Dems will have no chance in the presidential election if Biden cannot mobilise the progressives in his party. Trump \*will win the election\* because he was able to unify his party while Biden struggles to do so. I think that the DemSocs will not turn out to vote this election simply because they do not wish to compromise with moderates in their party. 

The point I'm trying to make is that if a proper discussion between progressives and moderates is going to occur, concessions have to be made on both sides. Otherwise, leftist politics will continue to be polarised and the GOP will continue to win elections."

The problem with American politics when compared to Europe and Canada is that it is way more conservative, even centrists and liberals when compared to Canada hold more conservative ideals. Almost every single Canadian can agree that the current system benefits everyone overall, even if it takes slightly longer for the average person. 9.9/10 conservative politicians in Canada would not repeal the current health care system and if they would like to, I can guarantee they would NEVER get elected. Are most American democrats for ""free"" healthcare? No, because when compared to the world they aren't really Democrats! They're moderate conservatives! The United States is shifted so far to the right that the average Canadian Liberal would be called a socialist extremist when Canada is one of the leading capitalist countries in the world alongside the United States."

Going further left doesn't make somebody ""progressive."" The Bernie Bots are intolerant of anybody who disagrees and freely smear other candidates. What's progressive about that? Pay attention to what they've said before and what they are saying now. When Sanders was ahead, ""you must vote blue no matter who."" After he lost, they claim ""the DNC rigged it."" They never mention the African-Americans who voted for Biden. 

Why does Bernie Sanders have this reputation for integrity? Because his supporters SAY SO over and over again? So now we see the Bernie Bots calling Joe Biden a rapist and a segregationist while Bernie Sanders says nothing. Remember, in 2016, Sanders said he was going to campaign heavily for Clinton and then join the Democratic Party. He did neither."

By this exact logic, any and all presidents impeached should automatically resign. Clinton must be a pure asshole for not resigning too because Gore could have just pardoned him, right? That's such lazy logic. 

Nixon resigned because he knew there was no getting away with it. That the evidence was so strong it would compel Senators to vote against him unless they wanted to lose their seat.

This is a mistake definitely from the CCP. The reason behind this is the following:

After the great leap forward (1961) Chinas economy was in shambles. The government at that time encouraged every form of money earning to stimulate the GDP growth again.
Some people specialized into wildlife trading. 

So why didnt the government ban it then? 
Eating Bat, or exotic animals is something similar to Big Game Sports in the West. Something only a handful people enjoy and most of those time these people have a lot of money and influence. Thats why the government is hesitant to shut it down.

"" The Party has definitely made mistakes in handeling the virus. ""

I just, as a phrased in my last paragraph, want people to consider what their governments could have done differently. Cause as you can see, not every country is effected the same way. Even some countries we assume would be. Countries with weak economies and/or were first infected.

Other couple of nations: Greece (Although a mediterranian country with a economy which is still trying to recover from the Euro crisis, they managed to contain the virus and arent even in the Top 40 of infected nations, although they are in other aspects very similar to Italy or Spain? What is their secret? They prepared in time. They took it seriously, because they know how fragile their public health system is and enforced lockdown measures before most countries did.

And Yes, welding people into your apartment are of course a violation of human rights. But what is the alternative? Suggest people to stay home and if they don't just let them be like in America? 

Its your choice. Saving lifes or Freedom?  I think thats an something you have to answer for yourself.

Regarding the next disease: This is a complete new topic, and it has nothing to do with the current epidemic. But except SARS and COVID, other diseases like H1N1, Swine Flu etc. are because we treat our animals with cruelty and destroy their habitats. We treat them with cruelty because we want meat. Cheap meat and don´t really care how animals are being held. As long as this isnt changed (how cows, pigs, chicken, etc.) are being held, this will happen again.

And you say you care but even you must know that there are zeroes missing from the Chinese numbers. Do you care about that? Do you care for the Chinese families who can't get the cause of death for their loved one? Because it sounds like you don't.

Do you know why Chinese people eat bat and other disease carriers? Yup.... It's because of the CCP.

The CCP are the villains here but your whole OP is designed to remove all responsibility... Why? Because you share an ethnicity. They don't care about you, your family or anyone else in China."

You must think everyone outside your ideological bubble is an idiot.

I don't give a shit about convincing you, CCP toady. You represent the destruction of China, and most overseas Chinese hate you! Enjoy watching your paymasters slide into the ash-heap of history like the vermin they are.

Given the current COVID-19 “plandemic,” it’s interesting to note the Rockefeller connections in China’s medical research.

Rockefeller Foundation (RF) has [invested in China since 1914.](https://rockfound.rockarch.org/china)

[The China Medical Board (CMB)](https://rockfound.rockarch.org/china-medical-board) was created in 1914 as one of the first operating divisions of the Rockefeller Foundation (RF).

“Internationally, the largest recipient of RF funding was China’s Peking Union Medical College PUMC, opened in 1919, this world-class medical college helped to introduce and develop westernized medicine in China.”
https://rockfound.rockarch.org/education

David Rockefeller:

“Whatever the price of the Chinese Revolution, it has obviously succeeded not only in producing more efficient and dedicated administration, but also in fostering high morale and community of purpose. The social experiment in China under Chairman Mao's leadership is one of the most important and successful in human history.”

1861,2020-05-03 14:38:08,gcq316,"Obama has zero respect for the guy.   Which may speak in Biden's favor,  as i think of obama as an even bigger a****** then Biden is. Obama did not endorse Biden until two weeks ago. If he felt respect for Biden, he would have come out for him, before Bernie humiliated him in those first three primaries. Biden even voiced his frustration with that.

 Bernie was so ostracized when he first got to the Senate, that kindness, even the modt SUPERFICIAL kindness from Biden made a lasting impact. That is not to say that Biden is charming. Only that the rest of the Senate was open in their disdain for Bernie. Bernie is first and foremost someone who builds Bridges. His loyalty derives from that,  not from charm. 

Say what you will,  Biden is known as being very different in real life from the way he appears in the media.  

""You are nothing.   You are NOTHING to me. ""  

Charming."
1862,2020-05-03 17:54:31,gcq316,">obama as an even bigger a****** then Biden is

Agreed, because Obama is smart enough to know when he is being an asshole, which is most of the time on political matters of substance.

Obama could have and should have had given the wink for somebody to disable Biden before the debate season.  Whether you call it ""charm"" or something else, something dissuaded Obama from blocking Biden's candidacy in 2019 the way he had done in 2015-16.

>SUPERFICIAL kindness from Biden made a lasting impact

1913,2020-05-02 22:14:52,gcdog5,Isn't this cherry picking a little? Cause you can say since 2000 democrats have won the popular vote twice. By starting with a democrat president I feel like it's a little disingenuous.
1914,2020-05-02 20:57:08,gcdog5,That is why the electoral college comes in very handy. Imagine if leftist states like the west coast and the northeastern coast made all the decisions for us.
1915,2020-05-22 13:14:26,gcdog5,Am I present in irrelevant facts? The United States does not decide the president based on popular vote.
1916,2020-05-03 12:16:39,gcdog5,ITT: people apparently mad that the Republicans campaigned smarter than the Democrats.
1917,2020-05-02 20:59:55,gcdog5,"Since 1850 Democrats have supported Slavery, Segregation, Jim Crow laws, the klan, and putting Japanese people in internment camps. Why would any one vote for that party? They deserved to be demolished like the confederate monuments throughout this country."

1919,2020-05-03 01:17:53,gcdog5,If the country became a popular vote republicans would get the majority because people in rural regions would start voting. America is a majority center right nation. Democrats would hardly ever win.

You say he handled the pandemic without competence? He closed down airports Jan 27 even when his advisors told him that there is no good reason to do so, it will be contained. On February 7, the Trump administration gave 17.8 tons of PPE to China, so that they could mitigate their problem and not bring it abroad ( [https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/us-tons-ppe-china/](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/us-tons-ppe-china/) ) Trump declared a national emergency on March 13 and soon followed protocol with state governors, ordering corporations to start mass production of PPE. Not only that, but Trump has also given authority to the Marine Corps of Engineers to build thousands of beds within days in New York ( [https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2020/03/27/the-army-corps-of-engineers-has-two-or-three-weeks-to-get-thousands-of-new-hospital-beds-up-and-running/](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2020/03/27/the-army-corps-of-engineers-has-two-or-three-weeks-to-get-thousands-of-new-hospital-beds-up-and-running/) ).

With that in mind, states have the power to decide a federal outcome. The founding fathers knew that pure democracy is flawed because states with higher populations will make decisions for states with lower populations. Imagine the president representing the country, but he only won because he managed to win the 12 states with the highest populations and none other (California, Texas, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, and New Jersey). Those 12 states will grant an automatic victory of exactly 270 votes. The idea of the electoral college is to balance the representation between a big state and a small state. Because big states always have a greater population, using democracy, the elected president will only represent big states. We have the electoral college to prevent that tyranny and balance things out. Because of the electoral college, smaller states have a voice, their population ALSO matters. That is the reason why the presidential candidates cannot just depend on those 12 states, some of them might not win in the candidate's favor. Therefore, a presidential candidate will also have to represent the smaller states. This competition between the two candidates for those 12 states creates uncertainty, thus, neither candidate can 100% depend on those 12 states to win, because they're both competing for them. As a result, in order to win, these candidates also have to represent the smaller states with the smaller voices, because their voice also matters. The goal of the electoral college is not to represent a majority of the population, but to represent a majority of the states, because like I said in the beginning, states determine the national sovereignty of the nation."

I don’t know that I agree about 2 technological revolutions, if anything I think we’re seeing a slowdown and we’ll be lucky to have even one revolution in the next 30 years. These are tough problems and we’ve been winning thus far by solving easy problems.

It's going to be just fine."", February 10th  ""Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away. I hope that's true.

In a fair election, you have to appeal to voters, not pieces of land. Giving people preferential treatment because of where they live is horseshit. 

You bring up what the founding fathers believed - do you know what else they thought? They didn't think black people could exist alongside white people without slavery. They didn't think that German people could come here and peacefully live alongside anglos. And they would've hated how women aren't segregated from men right now.

We shouldn't be listening to out of touch people who've been dead for almost 300 years now. America is diverse, let our voting patterns be too.

I mentioned that Trump downplayed the virus, in fact, everyone, including the media and Dr. Fauci, downplayed the virus. I remember, and I know you do too, media coverage saying ""It's not that bad, the flu is a lot worse"" and ""It is not a priority to focus on when there are things like the flu that are worse!"" Once again, everyone downplayed the virus. Blaming it solely on Trump is extremely misleading, especially when you have highly respected and intelligent individuals like Dr. Fauci downplaying the virus as well (  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKWyPQeiBw&feature=youtu.be&t=82](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKWyPQeiBw&feature=youtu.be&t=82) ). I don't think anyone is to blame for downplaying the virus, in fact, everyone did it. I was just trying to make my point of the hypocrisy of saying that Trump downplayed the virus, when in fact, everyone downplayed the virus.

Also, when coming into the presidency he promised he would reduce federal spending in order to lessen the unnecessary federal expenses and bureaucracy. I think everyone would agree that the government spending money on useless things should not be done, correct? That is why, in 2018, Trump fired the pandemic team. The government was wasting money for no reason. Of course, no one saw this 2020 pandemic coming, therefore, you cannot say that Trump firing the pandemic team in 2018 is mishandling of the virus. As a matter of fact, many people praised him for it on both sides because, again, less government spending on unnecessary things is, objectively, good.

Again, please read what I wrote. I gave evidence that there is no statistical difference with the effectiveness of mitigating the spread of the virus through lockdowns. Everyone knows about the flattening the curve, no one is disagreeing with you, but do the lockdowns actually work? No, statistically there is no difference between having a lockdown and not having a lockdown, considering all factors ( [https://www.spiked-online.com/2020/04/22/there-is-no-empirical-evidence-for-these-lockdowns/](https://www.spiked-online.com/2020/04/22/there-is-no-empirical-evidence-for-these-lockdowns/) ). Please read the article, I promise you'll learn something. In no way whatsoever though, am I saying that we should not stay at home. The science is clear on the effectiveness of flattening the curve, but statistically, there is no evidence to support that mandated government lockdowns actually mitigate the spread. 

I find it intellectually dishonest of you to criticize my points, when in fact, they're all true. I believe you're letting your emotions affect your judgment. You're misinterpreting what I said, making up claims of what I said,  and not even reading what I said. Also, I love this subreddit, it allows for civil debate about how we can interpret or use these facts and provides good knowledge that both sides can learn from."

2049,2020-05-02 22:26:49,gcdog5,"I don't think the electoral college should be abolished. Democracy is not inherently fair because it cannot represent everyone. The electoral college cannot represent everyone either, but presidential candidates have to try to appeal to as many people as possible, representing more individuals in the end. Also, a good reason as to why the framers of the constitution did not want a direct democracy is because people are stupid. The people follow mob mentality, follow perverse and irrational feelings, believe things that *feel* good not things that *do* good, etc. 

Also, states are really important. There always needs to be a balance between state-level governance and federal-level governance, always. Think about it this way:

People are stupid but deserve some democracy. This democracy goes into the local-level of governance and the state-level of governance (i.e electing smarter and more competent people that represent your needs in the form of a mayor, senator, representative, commissioner, governor, or etc.) These states now have representatives and senators. These competent and able individuals use their representative beliefs (of the people) to pass laws and bills on the federal level. Of course, because each state has different people, they have different representatives and senators with divergent beliefs. A state directly represents the people. The federal government directly represents all 50 states based on state-to-state consensus.

Most Americans, nowadays, prefer the federal government over the state government. In my opinion, that is inherently flawed because states are supposed to represent the people in their state that share a common culture, beliefs, problems etc. I find it non-representing of some bureaucrat in Washington D.C making decisions on my state's behalf when he doesn't know a single thing about our culture, beliefs, problems, etc. Even though people are dumb, they still have a voice-- a voice that has to be represented by the states in order to determine the sovereignty of the federal government. 

States government over federal government any day baby, its the consent of the governed."

They believe that American society puts restrictions on you on the basis of identity.

Republicans, on the other hand, don’t give a damn about your identity. They believe that social mobility is one of the greatest treasures of America.

HOWEVER, as more Americans start preferring the federal government over their state government, they would feel less represented.

It quotes journalists from the time of the southern strategy who talk about it. And I'll also leave you with this quote from Republican Party strategist Lee Atwater-

*Questioner*: But the fact is, isn't it, that Reagan does get to the Wallace voter and to the racist side of the Wallace voter by doing away with legal services, by cutting down on food stamps?

*Atwater:* Y'all don't quote me on this. You start out in 1954 by saying, ""Nigger, nigger, nigger"". By 1968 you can't say ""nigger""—that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now \[that\] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is \[that\] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me—because obviously sitting around saying, ""We want to cut this"", is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than ""Nigger, nigger"". So, any way you look at it, race is coming on the backbone.

&#x200B;

And now on to your incredibly bad-faith argument for why the Democrats are the party against civil rights. 

You know that when you have to resort to these silly ""they have low expectations for da blacks"" argument, you're admitting that they are actually pretty good when it comes to civil rights right? 

It's like if I said in the 1860s- 

""The Republicans are the real ones against civil rights. I mean, thinking that we have to free the slaves? What low expectations they have of the negro! Can the blacks not fight for freedom themselves like we Americans had? Truly the party of racism...""

I think you'd agree that that is me trying everything to make the Democrats seem less racist.

Which party opposed gay adoption?

Which party opposed gays being able to serve openly in the military?

Which party opposed women being able to serve on the front lines?

Which party banned trans folk from serving in the military?

Which party is tried to pass voter ID laws, only to be shot down by a federal court for targeting black voter with ""surgical precision""?

Before the 60s/70s of the Southern Strategy, republicans were already making great progress in the 50s with Brown v. Board of Education. I don't see how that is racist, but let's continue.

Look at it this way. If the south switched from democratic to republican following the civil rights act of 1964, why did only one senator (Strom Thurmond) switch to republican? If the South switched from democratic to republican why did republicans not have a *southern or national* majority in congress until 1994? ([https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/congress/#view=map&year=1994&xyz=0.5/0.5/1&show=winner](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/congress/#view=map&year=1994&xyz=0.5/0.5/1&show=winner)) You'd think that these ""racists"" in the south would vote for individuals that represent their similar ""racist values"", but they consistently voted for democratic representatives and senators until 1994---even though the ""parties switched.""

Truth is, the parties did not switch in the 60s or 70s. In fact, the parties switched during FDR's presidency (1932). Republicans founded their party on pro federal government and Democrats founded their party on anti-federal government. This all changed in 1932 during the presidency of FDR. FDR set a precedent for democrats to use pro federal government, more intervention, and immediate change. During the era of the New Deal, republicans were anti-federal government, minimized intervention, and believed in gradual change. You can now identify the polarizing differences between democrats and republicans.

Now back to the Southern Strategy. It is known that the South was largely democratic until 1964. Why is that? We know that Democrats were, at one point, anti-federal government and intervention. Because the South was democratic, until 1964, they favored state power over federal power. In 1964, the civil rights act of 1964 was passed and it was a large intervention by the government, dictating how states should immediately start integration. As horrible and cruel as this might sound, because the South was largely old democrat, anti-federal government and gradualist, they turned to republicans because of their emphasis on state power and gradual change (something you still see today with republicans). Although their actions of segregation were racist, their anti-federal government motives were not. Republicans have been against big federal government, intervention, and immediate action since the New Deal. To say that the republicans switched to racists notions to appeal to racists is misleading. Republicans were never openly racist and they have been proclaiming anti-federal government notions since the New Deal. It makes sense for the South to elect an anti-federal government, no intervention, and gradualist republican as president. Sure, some evil elitists of the republican party *might* have emphasized their anti-federal government notions a lot more to appeal to the South, but those anti-federal government notions were always there since the New Deal with Republicans; it was a lot more convenient to for the south to elect Nixon because he favored anti-federal government, low intervention, and gradualism. That is why I believe it is misleading.

Also, by percentage, Republicans were more in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil\_Rights\_Act\_of\_1964#House\_of\_Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964#House_of_Representatives) 

The original House version:\[23\]

* Democratic Party: 152–96   (61–39%)
* Republican Party: 138–34   (80–20%)

Cloture in the Senate:\[24\]

* Democratic Party: 44–23   (66–34%)
* Republican Party: 27–6   (82–18%)

The Senate version:\[23\]

The Senate version, voted on by the House:\[23\]

* Democratic Party: 153–91   (63–37%)
* Republican Party: 136–35   (80–20%)

I am not denying the possibility of a Southern Strategy or conspiracy of the like. I've seen those famous quotes a dozen times and I know they're real. Republican elitists did attempt to emphasize their position of anti-federal government and intervention a lot more to the south. But was it effective, other than electing Nixon? I don't think so. And I certainly don't think that just because the South voted Republican, they're all racist. I believe the Southern Strategy is a Democratic excuse towards losing the south at the presidential level. Republicans did not have a majority in Congress until 1994 in the south and the nation. I do believe that the people in the south have changed for the better---it just so happens that they have conservative values like those of pro-gun, pro-life, anti-federal government, etc. Just like any other group of people, their ideas and culture change over time---the same applies to the South, they're no longer racist.

>Look, I can agree with you that there might have been a southern strategy or a conspiracy of the like, but to say that the millions of people in the south who voted republican were strictly racist is intellectually dishonest.

Then what else was it? Literally the thing that happened before the southerners voted Republican was the Civil Rights act of 1964.

You may say that is was actually states rights, but the states' rights to do what? Lemme ask you something- Why has the South only supported radical political change when their right to discriminate against black people has been challenged? They did it by voting for the Dixiecrats in 1948, after Democratic president Truman desegregated the military. They did it in 1964 and in 1968, the height of the Civil Rights movement. And who could forget, they literally seceded from the union because they wanted to keep slaves. So, you can say it was about states rights, but it's clear the most important right to the southern states has been their right to subjugate blacks, aka racism.

&#x200B;

>Before the 60s/70s of the Southern Strategy, republicans were already making great progress in the 50s with Brown v. Board of Education. I don't see how that is racist, but let's continue.

This is because civil rights was not an issue divided on party lines; it was a North/South issue (I will prove this later on). So saying that Republicans were making progress is dishonest. **Northern** Republicans and Democrats were making progress. The whole party switch was actually just a time where Civil Rights became an issue divided on political lines.

Well that's because state politics are much different from national politics, and party stances vary from state to state.

A great example of this is the Civil Rights act of 1964. There can be so much variance in party beliefs between states that you can have Democrats and Republicans that support civil rights in the North, and Democrats and Republicans who don't support them in the South. So, politicians had no reason to switch parties.

As for why the Republicans didn't dominate the congressional seats in the south until 1994, there's a good reason for that. We vote differently in state elections than national elections. In national elections, you know more about the candidate and their beliefs. So, southerners saw that Democratic presidential candidates were more supportive of civil rights and voted against them. In state elections, you really don't know that much about your representatives, so people use party ID as a heuristic. So, these southern whites who were Democrats for forever, just kept voting for Democrats as their state representatives because that's all they knew about those guys. Once the generation born during the 60s was able to vote (80s and 90s), you began to see Republican congressmen and Democrats switching parties, because the people born in the 60s had no allegiance to the Dems.

The lag between how the South voted in national vs state elections is something political scientists spend their whole careers researching, so you'll find a lot of theories as to why. But, all agree that the race and civil rights was the catalyst for this change.

So if FDR was pro-big government, and Southerners were anti-big government, why did FDR win the South every time he ran? That's because your history is wrong. FDR's presidency didn't cement the Democrats as the party of big government, it cemented them as the party of economic liberalism. This is why blacks started voting overwhelmingly Democrat during this time period; Democrats were supporting the economic policies that lifted them out of poverty.

So, the 1932 election was just one of the political switches (political realignment is probably a better term). Other examples include the 1964 election of course, 1854 when the anti-slavery Republican party was formed after the Kansas-Nebraska act, and today with Republicans being anti-environmental protection when they were the ones who formed the EPA.

So, southern whites continued to vote Democrat as civil rights had not yet become an issue divided on political lines."

That is why I believe it is misleading. 

I've already explained why this is a false reading of history for two reasons: 

1. FDR won the South every time he ran, meaning the South didn't really care about states rights or big government when it came to economic issues.
2. We only see these huge political shifts in the South when the US goes through some big change relating to race. Whether it be abolishing slavery, desegregating the military, or civil rights.

And another reason this narrative is false is because the Republicans were just as pro-federal as the Democrats. I will break down the numbers later on, but Northern Republicans and Northern Democrats both overwhelmingly supported the Civil Rights act, while Southern politicians didn't. 

If it was about the size of the government and Republicans were for small government, we wouldn't have seen both parties agree in the North.

The fact is that politicians in the South didn't support the act because inequality of the races was a core component of their society and they wanted to keep it.

As for this notion that the Republicans were just anti-government and not racist, you're missing the point. That's the whole purpose of dog-whistle politics. You say something like ""I don't support forced busing"", which appeals to racists who don't want black in their schools, and when you're questioned about your intentions you just claim that you are pro-states rights. It's low key racism so that you can get the racist vote, while still being able to deny the racism.

And it wasn't some elitists that did this. It's very well documented that Nixon used this strategy to win the South.

&#x200B;

> Also, by percentage, Republicans were more in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 

Ok, now here's where I breakdown how this was a geographical issue rather than a political party one. 

So, all the numbers you gave were 100% right, but they are very misleading if you use them to tell which party is racist.

If we divide the votes in Congress by region and political party we get a much different image.

&#x200B;

||North/West|South\*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Democrats|95% (189-9)|8% (9-103)|
|Republicans|85% (164-29)|0% (0-12)|

\*I'm defining the South as any states that were apart of the Confederacy

So, this is the reality of the situation. North for, South against.

&#x200B;

> I am not denying the possibility of a Southern Strategy or conspiracy of the like. I've seen those famous quotes a dozen times and I know they're real. Republican elitists did attempt to emphasize their position of anti-federal government and intervention a lot more to the south. But was it effective, other than electing Nixon? I don't think so. And I certainly don't think that just because the South voted Republican, they're all racist. I believe the Southern Strategy is a Democratic excuse towards losing the south at the presidential level. Republicans did not have a majority in Congress until 1994 in the south and the nation. I do believe that the people in the south have changed for the better---it just so happens that they have conservative values like those of pro-gun, pro-life, anti-federal government, etc. Just like any other group of people, their ideas and culture change over time---the same applies to the South, they're no longer racist. 

You are functionally denying the Southern Strategy by downplaying it's significance. 

The Southern Strategy was used by Reagan and GHWB. It led to Republican presidents dominating the 70s and 80s with massive landslides in the electoral college. From 1968-1988, they won the presidency 5/6 times. So, to say ""But was it effective, other than electing Nixon? I don't think so."" is an incredibly ignorant statement.

And I demonstrated in this reply how race was the most important issue to white southerners and it's why they voted Republican. They voted Republican because they were racist. #notallsoutherners, #butbasicallyallofthem

The Southern Strategy is not the reason the Democrats lost the South. They lost the South because they overtly supported civil rights nationally. The Southern Strategy is the reason the Republicans won and the South.

I explained how state elections and national elections are very different, and that that difference can explain the lag we saw in voting patterns.

As to your question, I don’t think think democrats are the contemporary party of civil rights. Many Democrats and leftists support segregation of blacks and whites in many college campuses, churches, apartment complexes, etc. I don’t think that is correct. They still support obsolete things like affirmative action, which we have seen in many elite universities, compromise the admissions of much more able white applicants because of less able black applicants. That is not fair or moral any longer; in the 60s and 70s it was needed to enforce integration. As for republicans not wanting post-transition transgenders in the military, it makes sense. It is a burden to have any person with a mental illness (specifically gender dysphoria in this example) in the military, it costs money and these people are psychologically vulnerable and dependent on psychologically altering drugs and hormone therapies, they are unstable, especially during a war. As for opposing gay marriage federally, I agree with you that people should do whatever they want. But here is another perspective of why many republicans refused to comply or allow that. Most republicans don’t care that you’re having a gay marriage, the problem is enforcing people to comply on a federal level. Imagine telling a Synagogue that they must comply and allow gay marriage there because the government says so. That’s what republicans are afraid of, the government getting too involved and messing with religion and businesses. Remember that controversy with the gays targeting a bakery because it did not want to make a gay wedding cake because the bakery was affiliated with a religion? That’s why most conservatives take a libertarian stance and oppose the government getting involved in marriage in the first place. 

I think America has done lots of progress for civil rights. Conservatives don’t care about your identity. You could argue they care about transgenders in the military, but they don’t. They care about mental illness in the military and the expense that comes with it. I feel that leftists are far more regressive when it comes to civil rights in comparison to conservatives. Never before have you seen such a tolerated racism and antagonization towards innocent whites. The left is willing to take away the 1st amendment just on the basis of your skin color. Conservatives don’t believe in identity to be a determining factor i one’s life, they believe in character. Leftists believe don’t believe in character to be a determining factor in one’s life, they believe in identity. Remember MLK’s speech? “Live in a nation where they [his children] will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.” Which side was gone away from that? Leftists. I think we can both agree that identity politics is regressive and obsolete—especially when you find many leftists advocating for segregation and pretending that blacks are incapable of thinking for themselves or being held accountable."

The original comment by the other guy very clearly did equate them, glad you have the vision not to but it’s clear at least one person here certainly are doing just that in this very thread."

When he says ""freeze social security"" that's literally just meaning he's proposing an amendment that freezes the amount people pay. Your clip is 3 minutes long and Biden speaks for 40 seconds. 

Attack Joe after some real stuff. This isn't one of them.  I disagree with Biden over a whole laundry list of issues (minimum wage hike, being against charter schools, gun buyback problem) but I can at least say that those disagreements stem from a real issue instead of a made up one.

Bernie led one of the greatest grassroots leftist movements in the last 30 or maybe even 50 years. It sucks that it wasn't politically effective on the federal level. On a state level, democrats have been doing a pretty good job electing progressives.

Be my guest. With more knowledge on the subject you'll just realize I was right.

 

>Many Democrats and leftists support segregation of blacks and whites in many college campuses, churches, apartment complexes, etc. I don’t think that is correct. 

Examples? Black student unions? Is saying black students should form groups so their voices can be heard the same as saying white and blacks should be separate? You use this word segregation as if the beliefs of leftists today at all has any connection to racist policies of old like Jim Crow. It's so incredibly dishonest. 

&#x200B;

> They still support obsolete things like affirmative action, which we have seen in many elite universities, compromise the admissions of much more able white applicants because of less able black applicants. That is not fair or moral any longer; in the 60s and 70s it was needed to enforce integration. 

If you believe that affirmative action was necessary and justifiable in the 60s and 70s, you should believe the same today. Racial inequalities in higher education are still prevalent, and there is still a gap in educational opportunities before college that disadvantages historically oppressed races. So, until there is no more racism and until there is equality of opportunity, affirmative action is necessary. 

Also, racial quotas (which I agree were racist and unconstitutional), have been banned, so where is the violation of civil rights? 

&#x200B;

> It is a burden to have any person with a mental illness (specifically gender dysphoria in this example) in the military 

Transgender is not synonymous with gender dysphoria. They are two different things. So, if you are a trans person without gender dysphoria and you clear the same tests as everyone else, why shouldn't you be able to serve. 

But even if gender dysphoria and transgender were the same thing, why would that matter? Everyone goes through a psych evaluation before they are allowed to join, so if a trans person is deemed to be mentally stable why shouldn't they be able to serve? People with depression are able to serve if they haven't shown symptoms for a few years.

Trans people were banned for the same reason women and gays were banned. Republicans don't like them, and they have given excuses from women are too weak, gay men will rape each other, and like you said, trans people are mentally ill.

&#x200B;

>Most republicans don’t care that you’re having a gay marriage, the problem is enforcing people to comply on a federal level. Imagine telling a Synagogue that they must comply and allow gay marriage there because the government says so. 

But that didn't end up happening. That was an excuse in the same way that saying ""blacks will start oppressing whites"" was in respond to allowing African Americans into politics. The main argument posed by Republicans was that marriage was between a man and woman. Clear violation of civil rights.

&#x200B;

> Remember that controversy with the gays targeting a bakery because it did not want to make a gay wedding cake because the bakery was affiliated with a religion?  

If his religion believed whites were superior to Mexicans should he be able to refuse to make a cake for a Mexican wedding? 

If you are unsure where you stand on an issue of gay rights, put it in terms of race and you'll find out where you stand real quick.

And I think it's pretty dishonest to equate the denial of civil rights (like opposition to gay marriage), to the opposition to discrimination based on sexual orientation.

The fact that you have to cite these crappy examples of Democrats being anti-civil rights (all examples where they are actively trying to protect the civil rights of minorities btw), tells me that the Dems really are the party of civil rights.

&#x200B;

>Remember MLK’s speech? “Live in a nation where they \[his children\] will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.” Which side was gone away from that?  

But why? Are Democrats going against that because they hate black or white people? No! They just recognize that true equality will come when we have equality of opportunity, and since we don't have that yet (partly due to past and ongoing racism), we need racially conscious legislation.

And again, you are equating the discrimination MLK was talking about (literal segregation and Jim Crow), to the ""discrimination"" Dems push today (policies that aim to lessen the wealth gap between minorities and whites). It's very dishonest.

His abysmal performance during this Crisis is really highlighted by the fact he currently holds no office but his past experience does highlight he is capable of responding at the very least by not inciting protests against states looking out for public health. He also has been active on Twitter calling for cheaper treatment, free testing, and a constructive action. 

I like that you will continue to read and I respect that, I also respect the recognition that all media has at least some bias. But a good media states the facts without worrying about the blow back and there are some worth reading, although not as many as there should be.

This is a very good point. It’s indeed not fair to compare Biden and Trump on this issue. There are still things he did wrong (for example asking people to go to the polls and opposing closing the borders), but no reason to believe that he would do worse than Trump.

Maybe you are used to American media? The media in Europe and my country has its biases too, but when I look at how the democratic presidential candidates has been covered it honestly scares me. It makes it difficult to discern what is true and what is not.

Yes, voting for a president isn’t only voting for that one person. It’s voting for a whole cabinet and of course now the supreme courts.

I regularly read the AP, BBC, Harretz, Al Jazeera, NYT, LA times and my local Columbus dispatch, the truth usually lies somewhere in between what’s reported but it’s in there somewhere.

Biden has a good track record and like me a majority of Democrats did vote for him, in my home state of Ohio which voted Tuesday after these allegations (albeit with a dropped out Bernie) the margin was +56 Biden which is pretty significant.

US has eh infrastructure it’s never upset me but it’s not our biggest priority clearly, we are testing hyperloops and other innovations not to mention we have more roads than any other country, and our health care system is the best in the world if you can afford it, or live near a hospital like the Cleveland Clinic or Mayo, etc. 

We also have 3 branches of government and we have more pork barrel spending than most other countries which is very literally bringing money back to your district, that is super responsive.

Plenty of the roads they drove on were roads that I traveled on a daily basis. Same with the different towns. It's a great show to watch no matter where you live, but if you lived in that area, it resonates even more deeply. Just one of the many reasons I adore the show."

The show just kinda let the world change without trying to be a part of major happenings. Also I could be wrong but I don’t think Obama even taught at Columbia. I know he attended undergrad there but I think he taught at U Chicago."
2185,2020-05-03 14:48:52,gcbnhk,"This is so true. I’ve come to enjoy the throwback quality of the show as I rewatch it over the years. 

In one episode from 2006 he says to Melphi how just trying to operate a cell phone menu is enough to make you want to kill yourself. I remember that exact sentiment -how much I hated cell phone menus. The iPhone came out the next year and made this issue an anachronism overnight."

Jackie Jr, is to Chris, as Chris to tony and so on. It could be argued further that Aj to Jackie jr as he is to Chris and why not Vito Jr is to AJ, as AJ to Jackie jr. It’s allegorical.

Compare them too their Italian cousins, that family dinner scene shows how foreign the American Italian mafia is. Apart from initial discrimination, made boomer men took an oath unaware they’re kids are bourgeoisie and fathers were proletariat.

Some would argue Tony was boss of a glorified crew, but Tony himself was secretly fragile mentally and Sil was always and older head, just a couple years but Tony’s prob been coached by sil since puberty.

The story is sad, mostly for the mafia and that’s actually a good story for the regular person.

The Sopranos shouldn’t be compared to any show, it’s that good.

They prob decided on NJ over NY, to escape the politics and i hate imagining overzealous liberals diversity hired into the sopranos writing room lol"

I had a similar vibe from *House* (another good show from that period, though of course not as good as *The Sopranos*) because I grew up in Princeton (which is where most of my family still lives).

New Jersey in general had its pop-culture moments during the 1990s and 2000s -- not just *The Sopranos* and *House*, but also all of those Kevin Smith films and stuff like *Garden State* (and, unfortunately, *Jersey Shore*)."

Guys Tony’s age could’ve been a legit waste management exec, contractor, union leader etc and that dynamic would’ve remained similar, which makes the show relatable. I think NJ gives it that suburban family values aspect that helps make it more universal also."

2211,2020-05-03 11:53:56,gcbnhk,"A show in New York would have been much harder to do IMO. In NJ they could focus on the characters more than anything else, but in NY a significant part of the show would have inevitably revolved around the city"

The reaction of all the former Presidents (well, Trump is still President de-jure, but not de-facto here) is therefore calm, except for that of Bush Jr (for obvious reasons).

> “Pete’s notes are being cynically taken out of context in order to weaponize them to try to help Trump’s reelection bid,” he said in a statement. “Let me be clear: Pete’s notes do not reflect any attempt to interfere in the investigation of General Flynn by President Obama, Vice President Biden, or anyone else in the Obama Administration. The FBI’s investigation of General Flynn was properly predicated on the Russian government’s interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether there was coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia’s efforts. It is interesting that, after attacking Pete’s credibility for years, the President’s allies are again trying to use his notes, this time to undermine Vice President Biden.”"

2311,2020-06-26 16:18:57,hg7h1v,"Back then, the term “progressive” was mostly being appropriated by some conservative Democrats who did not want to be described by what was then the dirty word known as “liberal.”  

All of those civil liberties issues you discussed were major issues, along with whether to close Guantanamo Bay, whether “enemy combatants” could be held indefinitely there without due process protections, and whether “enhanced interrogation techniques,” like waterboarding and sleep deprivation, should be considered torture in violation of international law.  How to withdraw troops from Iraq, and to a lesser extent Afghanistan, were major topics.  Around 2005-06, there was also a major concern about warrantless wiretapping and the scope of the Patriot Act.  

Of course there were all the issues that are still being debated today, like abortion rights, marijuana legalization, whether all illegal immigrants should be arrested and deported, whether affirmative action should be banned, various issues related to the separation of church and state, etc.  Muslims were being continually demonized and were facing threats and hate crimes.  Gay marriage and extending employment discrimination protections to gay people were becoming the predominant cultural issues of the day.  Then there was the growing awareness of Global Warming that shook the public consciousness.  

What separated liberals and centrists from the far left back then was mainly the level of vitriol.  I remember some radicals laughing about killing Bush or comparing him to a monkey; the MoveOn opposition could not get their act together at all.  Meanwhile, the Republican Party had moved so far to the right after 9/11 that questioning any of these things would be met with an accusation of being “unpatriotic” or supporting terrorism."

I know Obama was writing this 15 years ago, but with the hindsight we have now from his own presidency, a McConnell style type of politics I think during the Obama administration it was rewarded with the presidency, majority in congress, and supreme court (including Merrick Garland's seat).

2316,2020-06-27 02:25:08,hg7h1v,"See the thing is I want Obama to be right. I agree with him. 

I think Biden says and feels a lot of the same things. 

But you can’t keep ignoring the concrete results of what Rs have done. The entire purpose of a political party is to win and exercise power. If Ds decide to not fully exercise their potential power to the fullest extent of the law, they are conceding to have the Overton window moved far to the right in politics. 

I don’t necessarily agree with it, but these are new political norms being set by this Republican administration and it’s foolish of Democrats not to accept it when they get back into power. If Bill Barr believes that the presidency is an all powerful position, let’s let Joe Biden take advantage of it. If Supreme Court packing is what McConnell did by stealing Garland’s seat, lets put Garland on the Supreme Court. The law allows it, it ought to be done.

Witness allegations have suggested that Manny was guilty of rape, murder and torture, including torture of Iraqi Olympic athletes and the national football team.

&#x200B;

Manny, the most headstrong among the Heffely children was also perceivedly the most flamboyant. Erratic by nature, he displayed utter ruthlessness towards adversaries and those perceived as threats to his power. He grew up idolizing his father, Frank Heffely, although their relationship later became strained due to his father's many mistresses. Manny maintained a close cordial relationship with his mother, Susan Heffely. The otherwise apathetic Manny, at his uncle's funeral in 1989, showed a rare moment of tenderness.

&#x200B;

Neglect and lack of bonding with Frank Heffely in childhood, over-exposure to the regime's brutalities, and Sajida's over-nurturing molded his character. After being handicapped by the assassination attempt on him in 1996, he maintained distance from Greg who was rising in ranks and thought to be Frank's next legitimate successor. Along with many other crimes, he along with Greg in 1996, were said to be involved in the killings of their brothers-in-laws.

&#x200B;

A report released on 20 March 2003, one day after the American led invasion of Iraq, by ABC news detailed several allegations against Manny:

&#x200B;

As head of the Iraqi Olympic Committee, Manny oversaw the imprisonment and torture of Iraqi athletes who were deemed not to have performed to expectations. He would insult athletes who performed below his expectations by calling them dogs and monkeys to their faces.  One defector reported that imprisoned football players were forced to kick a concrete ball after failing to reach the 1994 world cup finals.  The Iraqi national football team were seen with their heads shaved after failing to achieve a good result in a tournament in the 1980s. Another defector claimed that athletes were dragged through a gravel pit and then immersed in a sewage tank to induce infection in their wounds. After Iraq lost 4–1 to Japan in the quarter finals of the 2000 Asia cup in Lebanon, goalkeeper Muhhamad Avdol, defender Chirag Gupta and forward Mahatma Ghandi were labelled as guilty of loss and eventually flogged for three days by Manny's security.

Other allegations include:

&#x200B;

Manny was known to intrude on parties and otherwise ""discover"" women whom he would later rape. time published an article in 2003 detailing his sexual brutality.

Usage of an iron maiden on persons running afoul of him.

Beating an army officer unconscious when the man refused to allow Manny to dance with his wife; the man later died of his injuries. Manny also shot and killed an army officer who did not salute him.

Stealing approximately 1,200 luxury vehicles, including a Rolls-Royce Corniche valued at over $200,000.

Plotting, in 2000, to assassinate Big Man Tyrone, the leader of the Iraqi National Congress. This was done shortly after Saddam named his younger son, Greg, heir-apparent to the dictatorship. Manny allegedly intended to curry favour with his father through the assassination

After the loss of team Iraq in the 2000 Asia cup, Manny would spiral into a deep depression, sobriety was seldom and he was often found high on methamphetamines in his mansion. After his capture and time at Guantanamo bay, he would be released and would live the rest of his life in Cuba under a pseudonym, Gay Bowser. Manny would die at a drunken bar fight in Havanna on November 8th, 2016 after he punched a man in the throat for telling him that Barack Obama had won a third term in the American presidency, spurring a large brawl in the streets, this, however, was a lie."

Obama was an Ok president, stats wise he managed to make a couple sectors such as healthcare and education slightly better, if you look at him in terms of diplomatics he was also better than trump in that instance. They have their similarities though. Both have been at war with another country throughout their time as presidents.

In terms of who's better stats wise, Obama wins. That being said, with how the world is changing today and everything that's happened this year, Trump has had to face more challenges throughout his presidential term, and he handled a couple of them pretty well. So in terms of hardships overcome in a presidential term, Trump wins.

When it comes down to it though, compared to presidents in the past, both have done an alright job, but there's been better presidents.

I wouldn't go far enough to say they're both shit however. If anything, they're both mediocre at best."
2372,2020-06-27 15:16:14,hg40kd,"I don't have good words to describe my thoughts - but here goes... 

From what i can tell, you're trying to piece together a narrative from economics, social / cultural perspectives, history and intent (short vs long) to justify some person's cohesive strategy over time. 

And in some way, I could see how this \^ could make sense, but it's a particular view, with a whole bunch of assumptions.  And simplifies the changing complexities of individual / country /intertwined economies.   It mentions nothing of the impact of technology, productivity, or globalization and how 50 years ago, you were limited by geography and time, and nowadays, those limitations are lifted, you can engage / transact with anybody in the world.   Those things happened simultaneously and played a huge role in the geopolitical shifts that are happening.  What about technology and automation, and the impact that has on productivity (GDP) and the fact that macro level is of great benefit, but at the micro-locale level proliferates walmart and amazon over the small business owner.  I won't even get into  politics and foreign governments messing with each other. 

None of these things happen in isolation, they're happening all at the same time and are intertwined.   By choosing a particular perspective / narrative, some people will interpret things differently, and by doing so misses the entire point of BLM or the frustrated cries of those feeling economic oppression - these are very real things.

I won't even get into the implied assumptions sprinkled throughout. 

If you're accurate that some folks believe the above narrative - I feel WORSE about our ability to overcome the challenges together and get to a better place for all of us in the country and the broader world."
2373,2020-06-27 18:37:15,hg40kd,"Hi, thanks for reading!

I am trying to improve this explanation, so if you could help me!

All of which I wrote are supposedly self-evident by studying the basics of economics.

For example, the U.S. government debt, the treasury and the federal reserve.

Would the debt, treasury and federal reserve work in a different way than the way I explained? Is a high debt strangling the budget of the U.S. not self-evident? Is American consumerism, and American consumption power, an ""assumption""? Would I need to source all the agreements and incentives countries had to ally themselves with capitalism instead of communism? Is that not self-evident?

While I do not claim what I've written to be objective, I do believe this is close to what has been happening and what is the current situation about. American citizens have very little  incentive to listen to others nowadays because we're all fighting for investment capital one way or another, and nearly no one fully understands how their country's economy works. For one, Trump supporters understand to some degree, when a factory is built in China, China is reaping the benefits from our investment from that factory that originally was in the United States?

I'd very much welcome any concrete thoughts from your end. To be honest, you took time to read it all, you are already beyond most of reddit.

Would you say a second economic miracle in the U.S. would not be good for African Americans? Would you say the investment power returning to the U.S. would not be good for African Americans? Would you say a different platform that does not include in a better-invested U.S.A. is better for African-Americans? If so, which one?

Would say the basics of supply and demand evidenced do not apply or are assumptions? Say, if higher amounts of investment are made in the U.S., and more jobs are created, but not enough people are there to fill in those seats, that your salaries will increase? Would I be missing something here?

What assumptions do you feel need to be more urgently addressed? How can I improve this, if you don't mind to help others find reason?

As for automation, it is simply not an issue that is relevant in the current landscape of American politics, simply because the industries where one could be replaced are likely not be here due to access to cheaper labor overseas. The ""broad idea"" of a factory leaving because a 12 years old is cheaper, or a factory leaving and replaced by a robot does not change the issue of the dwindling U.S. budget, the increase in borrowing from the federal reserve, and the outcome. The current, great dilemma. Why would I do it here, if I could do it elsewhere, for cheaper?

The issue is U.S. unable to support its citizens due to an insane amount of spending in wars and a severely unbalanced budget, waning leverage, waning industries, and waning of government's ability to support its people. Trump's usage of the borrowing power to subsidize investments in the United States, instead of subsidizing wars is a huge break away from the old style politics as mentioned above. This should be self-evident, but would like to hear your thoughts of course.

Thanks for taking your time reading all of this, and I hope it has been helpful."

you've  asked for a much deeper conversation here, that will take some time.

Are you in college? Or around that age?  The topics you're speaking about - some of them come from academia (and not all of them i purport to be know well), but there's a tinge of idealism (ironically without the detriment & bitterness that comes with experience, aka age).     What I mean is, you speak of supply and demand, and investments as a unliateral goal, debt as a tool and capitalism in their absolute forms.  The reality is that they don't exist in their absolute forms - those ideal principals get perverted - mainly because people are involved and people are selfish (for their own causes).  There's actually very few people (as a %) who are willing to hold the line with integrity - for WHATEVER cause they believe in.  Capitalism isn't capitalism if you're picking the winners, and gaming the system for one side's benefit.  Supply and demand doesn't work when you don't like certain outcomes, and then magically / artificially change the conditions by dumping in TRILLIONS, not BILLIONS of $$.  And oh, it's not like most of that money landed where it was needed most.  Small business got very little.  Many of the unemployed are still not paid.  Stock market didn't drop, because it was propped up with that injection.   

If it's not clear, the system is not working the way that you described it.  And it's not just trump, or a handful of billionaires.  It's much more complex than that. - but there are a few players messing with the rest of us. 

The problem is that for most of them, the actual reality / implementation doesn't take the absolute form at all.  Trump isn't making decisions for the betterment of the country - he SAYS he is, but he's actually pandering to a specific sub-segment of the population.  And the way he's doing is it very much a win-lose position - much like most of wall street.  You implied an assumption that's good (e.g. ""we"" aka americans, we win).  But the reality is that we're not all the same, we don't all benefit.   Trump is saying one thing, doing something in the name of benefiting a specific philosophy, but is actually mainly helping himself, and his friends.

if you dig one layer deeper, there is a trend. That trend is that there's a class of individuals who have much more power (from money), and they're gaming things in a particular way for their benefit.  It seems like it's ""fair"" for all of us,  but it's not exactly fair when  they can afford an army of lawyers to fend off / navigate tax law or scenarios where they might get into trouble.  The average person gets squashed.   Different rules for you and me.   BLM, DEI (and gender equality), anti-big brother and anti-corporate movements are all sub-movements of a broader feeling - that ""we"" are getting screwed and are becoming pissed off.

That's the subtext that's totally missing in your analysis."
2375,2020-06-27 20:27:25,hg40kd,"That is correct indeed, but just the fact that it is missing does not mean it is not addressed in some way or form.

The U.S. default rate being 0, which means, for one, countries who invest in our treasuries will receive a return guaranteed, means this system is not going away.

The U.S. is allowed to borrow, because the U.S. (and the bank it loans from) takes for granted it will exist tomorrow and 30,40,60 years from now. You see, because every single country in the world relies on the existence of the United States in some shape or form, we have the benefit of being able to borrow as much as we do, as we guarantee to our bankers we will exist long enough to pay these bills, because if we don't, we know the whole world who relies on the U.S. as a counterweight to adversary powers will fight in our behalf. Unless they find ways to decouple themselves from the dollar, which is very hard to do, that is the reality of what is happening.

So you have to, first, come to agreements the current system will not change regardless of how we may think it is flawed. The Fed is allowed to print more money to purchase stocks, and so on. It is the benefit of the government that worked to have its currency to have inherent value. Maybe you've heard however, it is not unlimited, and as you see here, we've added 3 trillion to our national debt. Nothing can be done without some kind of outcome to balance it. Assets must equal to liabilities and equity in the end.

After that is done, if we are to analyze the class of high level investors, they still have to appease to one thing, mainly, Natural Law.

Capitalism supposedly follows Natural Law, and as such, it must follow where profits exist. No billionaire class will ever miss out on profits. Because profits may as well equal to survival. You go where yields exist. If it's more profiting to be here rather than elsewhere they will be here and they must hire you, there's no way around it. They cannot manipulate such things. If the U.S. tariffs a country where their investments are, they will miss out on such profits if competing investors/companies move out first and eat away their market share. A billionaire lives constantly in fear as these people may one day have a huge fall all of a sudden.

Before investing in a country, they must consider whether their investments will be safe and stable for 10 years, which is why, when a government is unstable, investment leaves the country. Just look at Brazil, and how quickly their currency devalued against the dollar (because investors quickly left, making the dollar scarce, again supply and demand) after many political scandals and instability in the nation. They might be billionaires but they're still playing by the rules of Natural Law which must follow profits and stability. Investors are still looking for certainty and gains

Right now the U.S. faces against a ""superstimuli"" (again, profits are a stimulus to capitalism's ""natural law"") where there is cheap labor and insane amounts of profits to be made. Just like Australian jewel beetles were almost gone extinct after being attracted to beer bottles (because beer bottles were a superstimuli of attraction, making it ignore female Jewel beetles), so is the effect in the american manufacturing being driven extinct to the superstimulus elsewhere.

Which is why all billionaires who seek profit ahead of the good will of others join the fight together with governments to dethrone the current president's strategy. You are right billionaires set their own rules, however, the ""economic oppression"" minorities face is inherently exacerbated by the scarce nature of opportunities, culminating in a single $9/hr internship requiring a Masters degree. This, of course, shows the increase in leverage said billionaires have (shareholder power), and the one citizens have (citizenship power).

The movement's policies are an attempt to increase citizenship power, and leverage, against the richer class, so representatives all over the U.S. need to drop their pants and open wide to compete for who gets to have an Amazon warehouse in their district (something even John Oliver made an episode about), versus Amazon having to compete for the workers due to an increase in leverage of the U.S. government and state officials.

So while yes, the system may be winged to some nefarious purposes like what happened to the stock market, our children will be the ones paying for what is happening now. The government agreed, if they don't do it in the end, they may as well not be born at all. Which is what made the CARES act historic.

I don't see how this doesn't accurately portray the current struggle, and why all multinational corporations partake the left-wing's obsession with culture to fight the current administration's (and supporters) pragmatism in increasing their own leverage against said billionaire class. Said class will continue to influence the minds of the people to convince themselves it is better to be broke, with a $9/hr part time job and just be miserable, than to be ""racist"". They will fight for others to forsake being pragmatic in spite of being culturally shunned, and attempt to convince left wing supporters of their ""white horsed prince"" will arrive who will do everything right and be fair to all and punish the billionaire class in some way, but as you wait for that, of course, resources become scarcer and scarcer, all while you're told to be receptive to all that is happening to you. Americans are convinced to fight against their own long term interests, and convinced to focus on culture, rather than economics, to hold on to idealism rather pragmatism, while the billionaire class is focused entirely on economic prospects (and access), and are ravishingly pragmatic, and are willing to let go of anything to achieve both short term and long term goals. This includes of course, governments seeking to protect their own investments, governments seeking to protect their own industries against a more competitive United States, who, by all accounts, still holds a huge amount of leverage against all of those who partake its system.

If this is not accurate, I cannot possibly grasp what is. But of course, this is what I am curious about! Thank you for reading, and I hope it has been helpful to you somehow!"

For more info, see:

> Gates was held for four hours and charged with disorderly conduct.[20][21] The charges were dropped five days later, on July 21, 2009, by the Middlesex County district attorney's office, upon the recommendation of the city of Cambridge and the Cambridge Police Department.[22][23] A joint press release by the authorities and Professor Gates said all parties had agreed that this was ""a just resolution to an unfortunate set of circumstances"" and that the incident ""should not be viewed as one that demeans the character and reputation of Professor Gates or the character of the Cambridge Police Department.""[22][23]

> During a July 22 news conference concerning health care reform, columnist Lynn Sweet, Washington, D.C. bureau chief for the Chicago Sun-Times, asked President Barack Obama ""Recently, Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. was arrested at his home in Cambridge. What does that incident say to you? And what does it say about race relations in America?"" Obama replied, ""Now, I've – I don't know, not having been there and not seeing all the facts, what role race played in that. But I think it's fair to say, number one, any of us would be pretty angry; number two, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home. And number three, what I think we know separate and apart from this incident is that there is a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately. That's just a fact.""[58][59] The President also acknowledged that Gates is a personal friend.[60]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Louis_Gates_arrest_controversy#""Beer_Summit""

> Obama had a Bud Light, Crowley had a Blue Moon, Gates had a Sam Adams Light and Biden, who does not drink alcohol, had a Buckler, which is a low-alcohol beer.

>Officials that inadvertently used the term ""slave"" would be reprimanded, but the actual practices of servitude continued unchanged. Scholar Indrani Chatterjee has termed this ""abolition by denial."" In the rare cases when the anti-slavery legislation was enforced, it addressed the relatively smaller practices of export and import of slaves, but it did little to address the agricultural slavery that was pervasive inland. The officials in the Madras Presidency turned a blind eye to agricultural slavery claiming that it was a benign form of bondage that was in fact preferable to free labour.[104]

>It is believed that after 1833 clandestine slave-trading continued within the British Empire; in 1854 Nathaniel Isaacs, owner of the island of Matakong off the coast of Sierra Leone was accused of slave-trading by the governor of Sierra Leone, Sir Arthur Kennedy. Papers relating to the charges were lost when the Forerunner was wrecked off Madeira in October 1854. In the absence of the papers, the English courts refused to proceed with the prosecution.[37]

He has already shown he is protective of them, so why is it so hard to think he and Meghan make these decisions together?

But the hypocrisy and optics have been dreadful, especially regarding the environment. Also, on the Africa documentary when Meghan complained about the press she'd received,  I felt uncomfortable as she had been meeting with rape and sexual violence victims. Couldn't she have waited and done an interview after the tour? It appeared as though her mind was on her own pain - which may be very real to her and I'm not dismissing it - but it's clearly overshadowed by the adversity faced by the individuals she was meeting. Shocking Optics.  Also Harry talking about his brother on the documentary is so awful, he was clearly trying to evoke sympathy knowing that William, because of his position, can never defend himself. Now when we think of that documentary we only think about how M and H were feeling, not the individuals and charities they were supposed to be shining a light on. I wish them luck in the future, but they will garner no respect from me until they stop making speeches and practice what the preach. Taking a private flight to see Elton John, or for a birthday 'jolly'  to Ibiza doesn't cut it for me. And H may say it's for 'security reasons', but if that is the case, then why do Kate and William fly commercially?"

He’s easily distracted and always looking to fit in. In the Army he found that, his high profile always got in the way of being one of the lads but it was the closest he was to being happy.

Yes Meghan is ambitious beyond her capabilities but this isn’t 100% on her. Harry is a little lost boy and in her he thought/thinks he found something lost long ago. Her mistake wasn’t getting off on the first floor like all of his exes and aiming to go full Diana. Never go full Diana."

I loved Suits (pre Royal) and really thought she was a cool down to earth person. But over the course of 6 months, my opinion of her did change. 
One thing I can't stand are hypocrites, and it did start with them praising about caring the environment when their actions spoke otherwise. They are wonderful speakers, and I do find them engaging. But how can one take them seriously if they don't follow what they preach? The environment was the biggest one I was very disappointed with. Then what followed was them wanting privacy, which I whole heartedly understand, only for them to do exactly the opposite of trying to actually have privacy. Seems very strange to me.
If they want to become celebrities, get involved politically, do speaking engagements, get rich, all power to them. But atleast be honest about your actions. Actions always speak louder than words.

I was convinced she was just a pathological liar when she released that video publicly (her private speech to her old school) about how she saw ""trees burning"" during the Rodney king riots. Blatant BS, I lived in that area and how she described it wasnt how it was. No trees were burning,  like wtf?! Weird thing to lie about, almost like she couldn't help it.  I'm just bored of them now.

The people who criticise Harry and Meghan began as their fans! We are just so disappointed that they showed themselves to be so selfish and disrespectful. We still have respect for and interest in the royal family which is why we are vocally opposing the stunts that Harry and Meghan pull.

It was AWFUL. It made me mad, here she was .. a voice for black girls around the world and she acted like a conniving brat. She has a good friend in Katherine McGhee, because all of these important friends she thought she suddenly had split when she trademarked Sussex royal and announced on Insta,  their plans to break from the royal family and tradition... to form thier own ""royal family."" One where they could make all of decisions and keep all of the money. She did this with out asking the queen.. they made the rules and put it on insta.. It was a cruel manipulation purposefully done in a way to make the queen feel as if her hands were tied. They thought by announcing it, the public and famous friends would automatically stand up for it. They really believed if they were denied, that it would be bad press for the royal family. Turns out the famous friends were only friends with them because of their role in the royal family. No one, not one person came to their defense. Everyone has since distances themselves.

The hijacking of the royal family without speaking to the royal family First? That did them in. Think about it, what was their sole purpose for going for It? So they could reap the benefits without having to answer for any of it. What a disgrace.

One thing that did bother me about all the hate at the beginning was the tax payer talk, as if these people were getting billed directly. The hate really did seem unfair at first. I think the hate mattered more to her than the position, or the good she could bring to her causes. She tried so hard to seem so good hearted, but it really fell apart when she disgraced the rest of the royal family on social media. She made the mistake in regards to all of her new friends, not realizing  just how fleeting A listers are and why they made friends to begin with.

They both have huge egos, aspirations of global fame and increasing their wealth, and are social climbers who tout their friendships and name-drop famous names to make themselves sound more famous (even though no had heard of Jessica or Meghan a few years ago). Now that people recognize the name Jessica Mulroney, they are interested to know more about it, and as they pay a little attention to her and who she is, it was ONLY a matter of time before her true colors showed. She's self-serving, entitled, demanding, ruthless and stupid. That was Meghan's best friend. The more people see of Meghan, the more they learn that she is that way too."
2633,2020-06-29 12:28:21,hfm3nd,"The privacy thing was what got me. I would have been far more sympathetic if they’d said “We want to raise our son in a safe, private environment away from the limelight” and decided to move to the Cotswolds, or somewhere in Oregon, or heck, even stayed at the home in Windsor that they used millions of pounds to renovate (and probably now won’t even use). But no, they move to LA, where they will always be in the limelight and get media attention. And yes, I know Meghan’s mother lives there, but a. They seemingly had no issues living far away from her when they were first married and b. she lives a very quiet middle class life, while they’re living in a mansion in the Hollywood Hills or whoever it is. Totally different lives and lifestyles. The negative media attention probably played a part in them wanting to leave England but I think the real reason is that they wanted to build their brand as global celebrity ambassadors while also having all the benefits of being royalty, and the Queen said no so they packed their bags for LA where they can really go about networking with the powerful people who can help them get their brand going and live the celeb lifestyle."
2634,2020-07-01 18:00:24,hfm3nd,"I don't think that was the issue.  I didn't see any articles saying Meghan was wrong not to pose on the Lindo Wing steps (though correct me if I'm wrong)

Richard Palmer explained pretty clearly that the press were upset they had been lied to.  As they waited for news, the KP press office said Meghan hadn't given birth yet and the Rota were to wait for more news.  That was untrue; Meghan had given birth eight hours earlier.  Several news agencies made the incorrect announcement or had to change it mid-broadcast, which pissed them off.   

I think that made the press more critical of the cryptic public signage, the strange baby announcement by Harry at a horse stable, and the decision to wait a few months to say the godparents' names."
2635,2020-08-15 02:57:43,hfm3nd,"Sorry, but who wants to pose after giving birth? That’s a ridiculous tradition that should’ve been gone. I feel sorry for all of them that had to do that."
2636,2020-08-24 09:26:28,hfm3nd,"It seems like she thought they could be a new entity of royal family and do it their way in America. I understand the press stuff was hard, but if only she could have just stuck it out.. The bullshit would have eventually paid off and meghan would stand resilient and the status she sought would have come into fruition. 
Even her biggest defenders confirm she was a nightmare. She was a new member of a gazillion year institution and she demanded things be done her way immediatly..."
2637,2020-12-01 10:19:34,hfm3nd,"I disagree. I like Meghan. She is intelligent and beautiful, but the idea to exploit Sussex Royal for private financial gain is so wrong.

It's almost as if the grandson of the president of a country would sell the state's secrets or government business in foreign counties for personal gain (a queen has titles, presidents have financial instruments).

A queen or a king (just like government or parliament) is a part of the political system (is neutral, but names the governments etc) and represents the country. And the power of all of RF members derives from a queen (king). They are also paid by taxpayer's money.

Btw, I'm not from the UK. But I think that Meghan didn't understand, that it's not about Windsor family, it's about the UK. It's good for the promotion of the UK to have a RF.  But they could change Windsors any day."
2638,2020-06-30 08:53:55,hfm3nd,"For real? They are working royals.  I can't stand when people act like they are directly getting foot with the bill. You are not paying their bills. I know it makes you feel important and all, but you come off like a vapid miserable twat. Regardless of whether tax payers pay for their diplomacy.. its been going on for years. Why this on will and Kate, but none of the others before them? Also, being a mom isn't easy.. being a mom, a working royal and having to maintain perfection after having a baby after baby is brutal. Will didn't ask to be will. I would put money that kate doesn't enjoy things like normal folks can.. She looks like she might be struggling a bit. She appears thin, a little unhealthy. Other than that, Kate and will have done a really good job being bland and predictable."
2639,2020-08-23 02:23:09,hfm3nd,"Kate does what a royal is supposed to do she attends charitiy events and other boring stuff constantly. She also has 3 young kids, manages to stay fit and active and look great, and she's a supportive wife to will, whom I assume often has a chaotic schedule. There's a lot to be said of a wife who supports her husband and family flawlessly, Kate manages to do so. 
What do you want her to be doing? Working a 9-5 at the office ? She's got a family to care for !"
2640,2020-07-15 18:33:36,hfm3nd,He is though. He’s unbelievably dim. He went to the best school in the U.K. & had to start a year late because he couldn’t pass the basic entrance exam. Then it came out his Art teacher was doing his coursework for him. Then he barely passed his exams. If he went to a crap school I’d understand but he was spoon fed at Eton.

It was refreshing to see a little color in the royal family and I was excited to see what MM would do with her platform. But when they decided to walk away from royal life via an Instagram post, I lost a lot of respect for them both. Don’t even get me started on them trying to trademark Royal Sussex. Yikes!"
2649,2020-08-05 00:05:46,hfm3nd,"This is the longest serving monarch the UK has ever had, she has been through war, and an untold amount of scandal and family drama. It was laughable that Meghan thought that she could back the Queen into a corner like she/they tried to."
2650,2020-08-03 15:24:55,hfm3nd,100% agree she’s no Diana. If she was still with us she’d kick Meg’s preppy ass to the curb before the wedding ever happened.
2651,2020-08-04 06:39:41,hfm3nd,"How can she pass off as white? It’s interesting how “Black people” say she’s White and “White people” says she’s Black. She doesn’t fit in with any category. A YouTuber called Snitchery calls this out as a mixed woman herself.

Not everything is decided upon because of race. Not everyone makes decisions with somewhat racist intentions. We call him Angus because he looks like an Angus. Don't turn the use of your husbands true name into an issue about race with your silly assumptions. Your assumptions are racist.  Its rude for you to assume that. We need major changes, but I've become frustrated with these silly arguments about *this being racist that being racist*  these complaints running rampant mostly proclaimed by white people who think they have it all figured out despite not living in the shoes of a black person. The finger pointing needs to stop, the message gets lost in that drama and people start to get annoyed. There's more important arguments regarding equality.. this white saviorism b.s. needs to stop."

Famous and wealthy people are a dime a dozen in LA and they have their own exclusive gated communities with security. Living in bumfuck nowhere BC Canada everyone in the area was talking about them and wondering if they would run into them. Leaving was a good decision when it comes to privacy."

Literally fought a big war once upon a time about it... shes never read a history book? We prefer our royals to stay in England where we can admire... from afar. Lol. 
Id have hated being in gossip magazines too.. BUT the RF literally told her to ignore it and it'd go away. (When I was younger I'd never think that would work, but now i realize w experience that its the best way to handle situations like this, not to respond. I'm shocked at her age she didn't heed that obvious advice, instead she got her 5 friends to do a gushy shes so awesome interview, etc.  Shes a train wreck. She made americans look like were all the stereotype of being pushing and ""my way or the highway"" types.  They've both thoroughly humiliated their countries imo, they could've done so much good together. But greed and ego prevails apparently.  Idiots."

It just blows me away that this woman so bluntly stated on Insta that they were breaking away from the royal family to form their own royal family  and do things their way.. unbelievable. They took the tabloid complaints about tax money and used that stupid argument to their own benefit by stating ""we want to pay our own way"" when in reality they wanted to cash in on the royal status without rules, which literally fucks over other working royals. The woman wanted things her way.. clearly. And I say ""woman"" because she runs the show and wears the pants... obviously.

You can't BUST out of a family that is hundreds of years old from the get go. She should have played by their rules for several years, gotten it down, then slowly proceed with changes. She acted like a jerk-there is no denying that when multiple people were saying it-from the start. And Harry let her. Disrespectful."

Everyone takes private jets, but only they get criticized for 2 years after the fact. They came back to the US because Canada closed their borders due to the pandemic. They have been extremely private. The only stories are about the charity work they’ve been doing. The photos you are referencing of them delivering food are from a security camera, no paparazzi were there.
And no will and Kate don’t complain...I wouldn’t either if I were as lazy as the 2 of them are-why rock the boat when you’re allowed to do the absolute bare minimum with no criticism. 
Imagine having a platform like that and doing absolutely nothing with it. Their charities are actually closing down...but focus on the people who are able to generate massive amounts of money for their charities and both have an impressive work ethic."

They made decisions for Sussex royal that didn't include the rest of the royal family and they told the public without consideration of anyone else.. like the queen.  They went ahead and trademarked Sussex royal. They clearly wanted to cash in on Sussex royal and have thier own royal family away from everyone else and they wanted to keep and control the money they made themselves. Unbelievable.

I mean.. I understand them wanting what they wanted, but having the audacity to make that decision and put it out for the public to see seemed like a manipulation. .. they believed  the queens hands would be tied by announcing it. The royal family are usually extremely careful when it comes to announcing stuff on social media.. it wasn't a simple mistake"
2677,2020-09-08 08:08:16,hfm3nd,"Something tells me they will burn thru 100mil quite quickly. Small price to pay for Harry to have given up literally everything, including Invictus (which wouldve been a conflict of interest with the Netflix deal)"
2678,2020-07-10 07:53:00,hfm3nd,"They are still taking private jets, in fact they took one to LA. Not 2 years ago. And 'everyone takes private jets' is totally irrelevant. Not everyone lectures us on saving the environment. You have to practice what you preach or it's going to be criticised. What has the fact that borders are closing have anything to do with saying they won't move to the USA because of Trump? Some of the pap shots were on a security camera but there were heaps of them walking down the street holding hands. Who are you talking about with the impressive work ethic, H and M? Where on earth is your evidence for them doing more than K and W? I was totally into Meghan when she appeared on the scene because she'd worked hard for her success and finally there was some diversity in the RF, and I have always liked Harry, so have been disappointed by their recent pontificating, especially with the Commonwealth as it was set up to atone for the Empire (which was abhorrent, there is not doubting that). Also, just wondering, which charities of Kate and Wills are closing down? And are you truly blaming them for this if it has happened, surely the Chief Exec and fundraisers are to blame for charities closing? Does that mean every celebrity/royal supporter of charities is to blame if they go under? Happy to change my mind if given discernible facts, so hit me with some!!!"
2679,2020-07-24 21:11:52,hfm3nd,"This is an old comment, but I wanted to correct one glaring error - the borders are not closed. They are closed only to non-essential travel.  American citizens and their family are and have always been free to return home."

Bradby, the guy that did the documentary for Harry and Meghan, said that Harry was trying to get a meeting with the Queen to discuss it but was told to put it into writing. Harry refused because he knew there were palace leaks but they pressured him...and Dan suddenly found out.

As for the trademarks, it's common practice. The Cambridges did the same as well. It's more to do with preventing people from cashing in your name, less to do with making money."

2684,2020-07-16 08:43:43,hfm3nd,"He's from The Sun, and he essentially threatened them to tell it before The Sun published it. They probably rushed to post it because The Sun will probably have some false twist on it. Even with their announcement of their charity, they rushed it because a tabloid found out and released false info along with it. Harry is currently in a case against the sun, and he's alleging that someone in KP was selling info to The Sun. Allegedly, the lunch he had with the Queen during their last round of duties was the only opportunity he had to be alone with her (idk how true it is). But yea, they never wanted to announce it that quickly and if you looked at the Queen's statement, it's confirmed that they were already talking about this (I.e. The Queen wasn't blindsided by their departure, she just didn't know it was going to be made public)."
2685,2020-08-07 23:17:35,hfm3nd,That's a standard practice to prevent people from merching off them. The RF does this (including Cambridges).
2686,2020-07-17 23:45:44,hfm3nd,"Yeah but its royal protocol to roll with the punches. What is happening with the press is nothing new. It almost makes me think that the gossip in the press is more than just gossip. Why be so upset over gossip? It would be upsetting if it was all true. It seems like there's someone in the royal family leaking all of this stuff. That explains their need to exit. Meghan would be super uncomfortable participating in the royal shenanigans knowing a possible family member was trying sabotage her. 

It sucks that the public berated them for flying in that private jet.  I would not be suprised if the situation silenced other celebrities who advocate for climate change.. worried they too would be called out for having a yacht or private flights.."
2687,2020-08-23 02:15:38,hfm3nd,"The Cambridge are ROYALTY. the Sussex are not. Thats why they couldn't sell their stuff that they'd already trademarked. BTW, the charity usually has the names trademarked. In Sussex case, it was them, not for a charity."
2688,2020-07-19 16:27:30,hfm3nd,"Our understanding of Royal protocol is just our plain old observations and assumptions tbh. The excuse of royal protocol falls flat when the Queen asked the press to back off from Sophie (when her tapes leaked), William who told the press to back off from Kate (when she just married in and wasn't doing much), and recently KP being quick to defend Kate from that Tatler article (which wasn't even that bad compared to the usual coverage the royals get). Never complain, never explain only applies to when the bad press for Royal A is making More Important Royal B look better. I suspect this is true here as Kate and William has been getting plenty of love. 

According to Harry's lawsuit, he's saying that there's somebody who's been leaking to the press. Meghan's lawsuit refuted some claims (like the amenities in Frogmore), and even released her text messages to her dad.

Ultimately, Harry's problem is that he thinks KP wasn't doing enough for Meghan. She and her friends were told to say ""no comment"" for everything, while the staff themselves were running to the press to spread mistruths. So I guess that gotta hurt for her, especially when she's post partum + privately dealing with her dad.

But yes, some of it was true. They found out about her baby shower in NY and apparently there was a security hazard there. Idk much about it though.

If you want to know my own speculations based on what a few reporters were gossiping about, I think William & Kate did a PR stunt with their economy/budget flight right after Harry was attacked for it. Camilla Tominey I believe (a royal reporter that has been very harsh to Meghan) mentioned it recently which was interesting. As this is just speculation, I don't care enough to hate anyone for it. I just think the family is general is dysfunctional, and anyone who steps down and earns their own money is fine in my books lmao"
2689,2020-08-25 02:58:21,hfm3nd,"The Sussexes started this process before they stepped down, and it was similar to the Cambridges. They halted it after they stepped down. Now they're doing the same for Archewell. A Google search shows all of this. Gosh."
2690,2020-07-19 18:39:38,hfm3nd,Damn.. Why are they so harsh to Meghan? For what? The reporters especially. What would they get out of It?
2691,2020-07-19 18:41:21,hfm3nd,"I specifically remember that economy flight too.. now that i thi k about it, it definitely felt like a PR stunt. Unless they are still flying economy.. are they?"
2692,2020-09-05 15:21:56,hfm3nd,"well, that is the problem, considering they had known they were stepping back at some point in the near future, and they still trademarked the name.  They didn't willingly halt anything, they were forced to. And I dunno what you read about archewell, but they didn't even fill out the paperwork for the charity correctly, or add a signature, and now have pretty much just given up on it. Its all a bit odd to say the least."
2693,2020-07-21 02:04:57,hfm3nd,"There was this journalist who has spoken about how a publication was 'twisting her arm' and even given her suggestions on what to say about her so she could write a negative article. 

This is just her experience, but i believe the smears on Meghan was done intentionally. The motive behind it however, are speculations. To distract us from Andrew? To send Meghan a message? 

Meghan wasn't a popular royal in the palace because she was known to work differently from the rest. She fought to make sure all the money made from her cookbook would go to Hubb (the kitchen the book is supporting) instead of the Royal Foundation.

She is also known to wake up early and start working, planning meetings etc to the point where it was really annoying for the staff.

Ideally they would want the royal to take a backseat and let the staff handle their work, but Meghan wanted to choose her own work and delegate, instead of the aides choosing and telling her how to handle her work. While that seems fantastic from our perspective, it seemed like this 'outsider' didn't know her place and wanted to change the way it's been done. This led to staff running to tabloids to complain, and she was then branded as Duchess Difficult. 

Rumours of members of the RF also came up, about how they thought Meghan was just in it for fame and would divorce Harry soon after. Don't know how true that is. 

Throw in Meghan's appeal to the public and you have people scrambling to put her in her place, while lifting up Kate in the process. As the more important royal has been getting the most positive coverage, there's really no incentive there to stop the hate against Meghan. The only reason would be to defend her out of love, and she simply wasn't likeable in that regard because she came on too strongly."
2694,2020-09-07 10:37:55,hfm3nd,"I don't think you get it...

they intended to work for the crown until the summit where they were told they had to step down entirely. So it makes sense for them to retain Sussex Royal for their foundation. Trademarking SR was a normal move that literally nobody gave a damn about until the summit, because it's a normal thing for the royals (as well as public figures in general).

As for Archewell, the back and forth is completely normal in this process and there's no real issue with whatever that happened. Of course, nobody talks about the Cambridges paperwork in the US (you probably didn't even hear about it, because the BM aren't getting paid to tear them down). All of this is basically a bunch of staff doing paperwork, no point talking about it because nobody truly believes any royal or public figure oversee this part. 

Also there is no indication that they given up on it. There's simply not much to announce publicly at the moment. Where are you getting your sources? It is no wonder why you think this is all odd when in reality, this issue is such a, well, non issue."
2695,2020-07-21 07:51:32,hfm3nd,"""Work differently from the rest"" is what bugs me. She was new to the family. I think it's rude to behave that way especially at the begining.  She should have played by the rules out of respect for Harry and his family. If she had an agenda, which it seems she did, she should have waited and moved slowly. I can see why she rubbed people the wrong way. She seems psychopathically type A, and I get that impression from what you've described about her above. Her behavior made her appear as if she had an agenda.. It probably made people uneasy and it takes a lot of balls to marry into the royal family and believe you have the right to do things your way.. disregarding protocol, tradition. She had an agenda.. and it wasn't based on her love for Harry."
2696,2020-09-08 09:27:40,hfm3nd," Their IG said archwelle has been postponed until after next year, and its not normal for the lawyer filing their paperwork to not add a signature. Tbh I'm way too busy and lazy to go do another research project to post links on all the weird evidence there is out there to suggest their charity was just a money grab, but if anyone is interested, check the us patents website online search. 
And every single I article that allows comments that features them has zero people saying ""I love them they're great"". Everyone hates them. I have no idea why they're even getting work or why anyone would work with them but I have no idea what really goes on behind the seasons of the rich elitists either."
2697,2020-07-21 12:45:41,hfm3nd,"Was Diana a psychopath as well? She has talked about how the institution didn't like her style of working and how it broke tradition, and how they tried to smear her reputation so she would lose public support. 

It's interesting how you think her style of working meant that she is somehow a psychopath and doesn't love Harry? It would be more honest if you'd admit you simply wanted to hate her from the start, because no neutral person would immediately land on that big of a character judgement. If anything, she's just annoyingly American in a stuffy institution.

It's not tradition to be a lazy royal, let's get this clear. If you looked at her output within her first 2 years, you would see that she put out a cookbook, a capsule wardrobe and a tote bag that directly helped her patronages (financially). Compare this to her contemporary counterpart Kate, and you'd see she didn't benefit her patronages through her own initiative. Meghan's 'different style' directly benefitted the British, as much as they want to smear her name. 

If that's breaking tradition, the royals need to do more of it now. No ribbon cutting, no throwing each other under the bus to prevent a scandal from leaking, none of that anymore please."
2698,2020-09-09 07:01:51,hfm3nd,"They don't have an Instagram account currently. Sussex Royal is their only account and it is not active. They also never meant to announce Archewell but it was leaked along with some inaccurate information so they had to put out a statement. I'm not surprised they're taking long, especially with COVID. 

The whole paperwork thing has got to be the most boring thing the trolls are fixating on. Many paperwork tend to go back and forth because of oversight. Why is this a big deal? That someone was careless? So what? Like I said before, the Cambridges have a similar experience and it's not news because...it's simply not news.

And no, not everybody hates them. This is the Internet we're talking about. There are literally troll farms for any polarising public figure out there. Also fans don't usually comment on articles if they're going to be overwhelmed with Karens. If you'd go on social media like on Twitter, you would see Meghan and Harry have enough support. You're just succumbing to confirmation bias. Remember, the average person who's fond of a public figure won't go out of their way by going to a website to comment an article. You'd just see their RTs/likes or comments on social media. 

Trolls, however, would stalk a public figure...find their address, pictures of floor plans, zoom into see what Meghan is holding and find the name of her dentist and so on. Of course they'd go to some website and spam hate comments. They literally did that to the charities Meghan promoted and have openly encouraged each other to do so, so Meghan and Harry would not look popular. The elites see through this, and the haters have poisoned the well so to speak. Their criticism now just looks like whining. They should have played it safe. Meghan never really had a very passionate fan base/support until people felt like people were being too hard on her. I, for example, never really cared much for her outside of Suits until I saw how Brits were treating her."
2699,2020-11-25 20:59:00,hfm3nd,I completely agree. You have given so so SO many examples and yet this person keeps turning it around as a negative. Definitely wanted to hate from the start in my eyes.
2700,2020-09-18 20:37:40,hfm3nd,"While I dont know of any ""troll farms"", (why?..created by whom, paid for by whom?) I do know there are bot farms that are paid for by whatever pr firm the paying employer hires in order to boost their popularity online. Im not really aware of any organic fan pages for Sussexes actually.. just a simple look on one the top 5 webpages on the internet (quora) shows what people actually think of them. Its not good. Their only fans appear there to be ones from India (known for outsourcing online activities such as this- i myself have outsourced to India, its very cheap and can thus afford more paid popularity boosters) who struggle with the English language and have the mental capacity of young teens. Most likely they're legit albeit young and naive fans, or paid employees. 

They still have the dormant Sussex Royal website and Instagram up, which is a loophole because while they aren’t actively using it, they are still using it to showcase their ‘work’ and to promote themselves. Even after the Queen told them not to. 

Add to this the Sussex Royal Foundation still hasn’t been wound up as a company, which means that it did trade, otherwise it could be wound up within a few weeks. That is unless there are some (creative) accounting issues to deal with. Harbottle & Lewis were the law firm that they are using for this particular venture, they've been replaced.  
According to The Sunday Telegraph, ‘Archewell LLC’ and ‘Archewell Inc’ have been set up in Delaware (a tax haven and where companies can shelter), but one must ask if it is all above board, then why hide the companies? To be honest, there probably isn’t much to see but it gives the illusion that there is a brand in place.

So how do you save face, while stringing the public along, while you seek backing, and make it look as if you had it planned all the time? Would one go to all the trouble to set up a brand as a hoax to distract the public from other activities? I recall my old law professor discussing legal tactics and what was permissible, and what would stray into the grey area. Hypothetically, when a client desires a specific outcome, how do you achieve this in order to keep the business, but also to act legally? Very often lawyers discuss mishaps and errors and the outcomes, and so when an error occurs and it turns out to be advantageous, one can’t help but do some chin scratching when things happen accidentally (on purpose) and work out to suit the client.

The lawyer used for the Archewell trademark application is experienced in IP law, and so to make one error is clumsy, but two seems to be ‘suspiciously wrong’, especially when the outcome is advantageous. Forgetting to sign the application is a foolproof way to ensure that the application would be stalled and is easily overlooked one could say, but as it’s the last thing to check on the form it’s hard to miss too. Of course it’s possible with such a busy caseload, but that’s a rookie mistake that few make. As for the miscalculation of international classes, the problem was that there is no definitive structure to the brand, and thus Class 42 didn’t appear to be included, although a vague description of what it entailed was included in another description. Part of the examiner’s role is to ensure the correct classes are being applied for, and they saw the application as having at least 9 International Classes whereas the lawyer only identified 8 of them. To be fair, given that the purpose of the trademark and brand is so vague, it is an error that was plausible, but for an experienced lawyer it shouldn’t have been overlooked.

The end result is that the application was on hold, and with the non-final action notice sent (2 June, 2020), a response (with required amendments) needs to be filed within 6 months of the notice being issued. What that means is the trademark ‘Archewell’ can be held without being active, thus protecting the status as it has been applied for (but not guaranteed). This works for the Sussexes as they don’t appear to have a plan, but it makes them look as if they have one. 

Most trademarks need to be actually trading before they apply, such as an active website and offering goods and services, because how can you protect a brand that doesn’t exist or trade?  Those that aren’t trading, are given a few months to be active, and that’s usually because of a physical launch of a product that has been delayed due to production or design. There is no reason why the brand can’t have a website outlining what their objectives are, and thus The Telegraph article making out that plans are stalled because the duo want to focus on BLM and the impact of coronavirus is simply bull."
2701,2020-09-18 21:14:55,hfm3nd,"so, all in all, its not just ""trolls and stalkers"" who are disfavorable of the sussexes, its regular, educated people- who don't like being fed lies by 2 people who have otherwise done absolutely nothing to the betterment of the world to have even earned their power position, and who are blatantly trying to pull the shield over Joe publics eyes in order to personally financially gain. Its abhorrent.  
Their PR firm sunshine Sachs is abhorrent. Companies like them that interfere in actual, organic online content with their shills and bots... its pure greed. 
 
People may have looked the other way in the UK when their prince Harry (whom we adored here in america too! And wept over his mother, it was very sad) acted as a rebellious teen who understandably made some major faux Paux, but we dont have royalty in america, let alone Santa Barbara, and we dont want them here. Hopefully everyone remembers from our high school history classes that we fought(and won) a major war over royalty being here. He will not and should not be extended the same consideration here. 

Dont even get me started on their charities, which are now being scrutinized as they're not exactly on the up and up. Im sorry but when you are pocketing 95% of the $ donated thats not a charity. Its stealing from poor people and manipulation. 
THE ELITES?? What and who are the elites?? They signed the same contract Netflix gave the Obamas. To produce movies and docs for them.  Obamas signed that contract in 2017 and have yet to produce a single noteworthy one. It appears netflix gave the sussexs the deal as a way of buying their exclusive rights. They can't give any interviews now to anyone except netflix, for a few years. They'll probably want a Diana doc too. So harry is selling out once again his dead mothers memory and gaining financially. He wasn't the only one who lost a mother, i might add. Harry also canceled invictus which im sure he used as a bargaining chip (some charity eh?) And remember when he couldn't go to an invictus thing cuz he had to go to the Disney premier of lion King? Which im also sure was another deal he struck in order to get his wife that voice over gig (which she didn't, as popularly claimed,  donate to charity- check the charities donation logs.)"
2702,2020-09-19 12:54:12,hfm3nd,"Troll farms are usually made to just stir the pot and polarise figures. It doesn't have to be a huge conspiracy (I.e. It doesn't have to be created by William.).

You're rambling on and on and it makes no sense at all. No organic supporters, really? I'm on twitter and I see real people (mostly black Americans) supporting her. One of them literally has police protection because some Meghan trolls found her address (she has a Sussex Squad podcast).

And the Sussex Instagram is not still posting. It's an inactive account and they stopped using it the moment they officially stepped down. There's no proof that the Queen asked them to delete it, and since all the posts are from a time when they represented the monarchy, there is 0 problem."
2703,2020-09-19 13:08:00,hfm3nd,"It's clear as day that the Sussexes have supporters that are not bots. Of course, confirmation bias is a hell of a drug for you. Time to be a bit intelligent here, dude.

Their charities aren't failing, by the way. COVID has hit charities hard but they're still functioning and they not pocketing their money, geez..these are all verifiable facts you could have googled before writing. If you truly cared about the patronages, why no post about Kate's having to close down? Or how they told her straight to her face that she didn't visit them for 8 years (no shade to her though, I'm rather indifferent towards her). 


Elites as in the people they're working with. They are the ones giving Harry and Meghan money and clearly they don't buy the shit trolls online and people such as yourself are spewing. The well has been poisoned and they know it. Every single move is heavily critiqued as if the Royals haven't done something similar (e.g. William pitching a documentary, Harry working with Apple or Netflix before he stepped down). 

Your past paragraph gave you away. Firstly, there's a couple of projects that are already in the works. I think it's Harry's projects. You can't act objective when you're literally whining about the possibility of a son making a documentary about Diana. Guess what, both sons can talk about her as much as they want to, and they had, and they will! Remember the documentary both of them participated in? They also certainly can give interviews to the media if they choose to. Please go and read up what contract they have signed. 

Harry didn't cancel Invcitus because of Netflix. In fact, he currently filed a legal complaint against that tabloid writer who wrote that piece, and Invictus has issued a statement refuting those claims. 


Again, confirmation bias is a hell of a drug. I don't have to be their fan to see the blatant attempts. The energy spent on smearing the two royals that is financially independent and not the corrupt ones who are covering up Andrew is one obvious sign. 

Like...just calm down already. Be a little objective. It doesn't hurt. A quick glance at your history shows you think she faked her pregnancy and bunch of lies. I say this with love, fix your soul. You know you have a problem when most of your comments are snark directed at someone you truly don't know."
2704,2020-09-22 07:56:50,hfm3nd,"Yeah I was a bit lengthy there... but the point being... it wasn't ""Not newsworthy"".  Smut mags and teenagers just don't care about this kinda stuff. 

To be fair, I'm not on twitter much. I have no use for it really, being as I'm not a celeb or a politician. But if all her fans are on twitter, I will go take a look to prevent ignorance on my part. Im honestly curious what people admire in either her or prince harry. So what does this sussex squad do/ talk about?"
2705,2020-09-22 08:05:07,hfm3nd,"Well...Kate has a large family including 3 young kids and a home to keep up. Im sure charities are the last thing of importance to her. 

It's just in bad taste for only one son, to bank roll on his mothers memory. Sure he can, but should he. Then again Hollywood elites aren't known for their integrity. 

Oh, what do you know, another lawsuit. He could've postponed invctius but he canceled it instead.  Thank you for your prayers on my ""soul"", lol. It means a lot to me. And Hey, these are just my opinions, I'm entitled to them.  There's way too much weird stuff going on w them.  Just pointing that out. 
And as far as confirmation bias, literally I posted facts, (which you haven't done this entire convo) so...."
2706,2020-09-22 08:08:18,hfm3nd,"Also, im not gonna even talk about the creepiness that you stalked my profile and comments,, but i don't use my real identity online, anywhere.. I have many throw away accounts, this being one of them. So really, you have no idea what I spend my time on, its just that this one is to satisfy my ""gossip"" account."
2707,2020-09-23 05:57:21,hfm3nd,"Like any high profile figure, they'll have fans and haters. They have planted trees and started fundraisers before they stepped down and hired the PR firm. This is probably one of the most straightforward things one can see for themselves, but people would rather make up conspiracies about how all their fans are bots. Geez. Her fans are on Instagram and Twitter, and they tend to get viral tweets from time to time. It's a matter of audience. Quora isn't a good representation of the population because most people there are of a certain age group, and a fan in her 20s isn't going to go and answer random questions on Quora. Even the comments on Quora aren't factually accurate. Fans will spend their time on their own account, interacting with other fans. This is basically common sense, anyone on Social Media would know this. 

And to address your other comments.. 

""Well...Kate has a large family including 3 young kids and a home to keep up. Im sure charities are the last thing of importance to her."" if she's living a life of obscene wealth off on public money, then she needs to do her job. I empathise with working mothers, but hey, either she does enough to justify her privilege, or she makes her own money. I didnt care for H&m and this was basically the main reason why I have respect for them. I'd rather them be Hollywood elites than to use taxpayer money. Because either way, they're going to work with charities. Private money over public any day. H&m won't be representing UK in the US, they'll just be two people making money in whatever way they want. So your past comments about the ""war"" were pretty irrelevant. You would have a valid point if they were working royals that are staying there. I believe they wanted them to stay in South Africa, but Harry hinted at the history of colonialism. 

""It's just in bad taste for only one son, to bank roll on his mothers memory. Sure he can, but should he."" Both sons have talked about Diana at length. You're getting angry at a hypothetical scenario of Harry profiting off Diana. Chill a bit! 

""Oh, what do you know, another lawsuit. He could've postponed invctius but he canceled it instead. Thank you for your prayers on my ""soul"", lol. It means a lot to me. And Hey, these are just my opinions, I'm entitled to them. There's way too much weird stuff going on w them. Just pointing that out. And as far as confirmation bias, literally I posted facts, (which you haven't done this entire convo) so...."" The legal complaint is because Roya wasn't reporting it truthfully, hence why Invictus corrected the article. Invictus will resume later. I don't think it's a lawsuit but a legal complaint as of now. 

Yes, you're falling prey to confirmation bias and I've pointed it out (which you chose to ignore). This conversation is getting pretty tiresome because you want to hate them. You don't hate them because of certain things you happen to chance upon, that's the difference. It doesn't matter how many throwaway accounts you have or what you do with the rest of your time.

You've spend a good portion of your time being gossipy over 2 strangers. It doesn't matter if your real identity is here or not. Because these comments are still reflective of who you are as an individual. So honestly...be better mate. 

I personally can't comprehend wasting time on public figures I hate, so I genuinely don't get why this sub is filled with nastiness. I'd say leave the snark to politicians whose lives actually affect us, or pedophiles who aren't cooperating with the law, not to any public figures whose actions have no effect on us at all! They can buy 10 mansions for all I care!"
2708,2020-09-23 06:16:43,hfm3nd,"It's not creepy if I'm looking at this account only, lol. I would never try to doxx you or find out other personal information because that's just shitty. Your comment history here are made public, so it doesn't really matter. And see my other comment for your whole ""gossip account"" excuse (which is basically, it doesn't matter what type of account you have or what else you do. Your comments are a reflection of your true character whether it's on a throwaway account or not)."
2709,2020-09-23 07:18:55,hfm3nd,BTW I didnt care about them until I found out they were still using their titles while working in the US (which is technically illegal as we dont acknowledge British titles here) and she keeps commenting POLITICALLY AND SAYING SHE WANTS TO RUN FOR POLITICAL OFFICE.
2710,2020-09-23 06:49:09,hfm3nd,"Like I said, quora is a very popular website. Not as popular as Twitter maybe, but its def a place for people who are educated and able to come to a conclusion and discussions of more than 20 words per post. 

I never said all her fans are bots. I said a lot. The reviews on Amazon for her book had to be frozen because bots were manipulating the reviews to make it seem more popular. I read parts of the book. Its TERRIBLE, it deserves the one star people give it. Its reads like it was written by teen, for teens. Most likely written by markle herself, because of the included details only she could've possibly known, like what she was thinking or wearing or eating or her ""perfect warrior poses"" (yoga). 
I personally can't comprehend spending time defending a celeb you've never and WILL NEVER meet. Especially one who vagrantly lies to the public, runs away from responsibilities,  hates her own family, destroys their spouses familial relationships, and financially benefits from charities. Its disgusting."
2711,2020-09-23 06:50:42,hfm3nd,"I can see your obviously too ignorant to even have a debated discussion, and instead resort to telling me to ""chill"" instead of acknowledging valid points I've made.  Dismissing rather than verifying. So I'll end this at this point,  Good luck with your obsession."
2712,2020-09-23 06:38:04,hfm3nd," Also, you talk a lot about ""confirmation bias"", but totally disregard any comment that is verifiable, well thought out and correct if it is negative towards the markles. I checked out Twitter and the cult sussex squad, and it appears to just be a group of weirdos whose sole purpose is to attack anyone who make any negative comments about the sussexes, regardless of fact. They dont actually talk about the awesome things they're doing, (prob cuz they're not doing anything awesome) they just attack anyone who doesn't love them. Its an obsession. Something tells me you are most likely a member of the sussex squad.  
The person you mentioned who needs police protection against anti marklers, you neglected to mention they need that protection because they instigated and condoned people into actually hurting other people. People are rightfully pretty pissed. 
You seem to know wayyy too much to be just your average run-of-the-mill fan.  Curious how you find out about these little not very reported on details about them?  
And doxx away, you won't find much. Not to mention its ILLEGAL. But I'm actually curious what you'd find out."
2713,2020-09-23 10:27:01,hfm3nd,"You do know that since there's a one year review in place, them dropping their titles fully would be considered disrespectful to the Queen? They informally dropped the significant part of their titles (HRHs) that matter, but the Duke/Duchess thing is basically a gift from the Queen to them upon marriage (which means Meghan would be Duchess even if she divorces, like Fergie). The only way they officially lose those titles would be to have the Parliament strip it away, which will open up a can of worms. Think about it as part of their legal names. On formal documents, their titles are often used. 

And it's not illegal to use British titles in the US. Please don't be silly. You guys may not care for them, but the States still acknowledge them as Duke/Duchess ""technically"". 

Also Meghan did not say she is running for office or that she wants to. Show me proof that Meghan keep saying she wants to run. 

It seems like facts are no longer in style these days. Talking about political participation isn't forbidden, given that Meghan gave a speech on women's political participation as part of her Royal duties in New Zealand before, as well as the Queen encouraging people to vote in Scotland. The only issue you can bring up is that she's close with Left wing people, or that she's 'hinting' that she supports Biden. Which seems to be okay because she was allowed to do so when she was a working royal"
2714,2020-09-28 15:08:05,hfm3nd,"The US does NOT acknowledge them as Duke and duchess, I can tell you that without a doubt. Not that we ""don't care for them"", its in our CONSTITUTION. Its called the Emoliment Clause. 

""The United States has always held to the belief that an elevated rank should be earned—not conferred, bestowed, or inherited. Accomplishment, being the end result of hard work, takes on meaning because it reflects the true amount of skill and effort genuinely applied. A royal title that’s granted or bestowed upon another undermines this notion. A Title of Nobility makes it seem as if others are inherently superior, and thus entitled to special favors which others may not share. Further, the United States does not acknowledge any form of a class or caste system. We do not judge another by the identity of their parents or by the purity of their bloodline. Our Presidents are elected—not appointed by reason of birth or divine right. By preventing Titles of Nobility our founders laid the groundwork for a society that’s not divided by class. They stripped government of the authority not only to confer royal titles but to confer any power associated with such titles""

I can call myself a princess all I like, and the govt won't force me to stop but they won't acknowledge it either. Same for them. Its quite appalling meghan gets these ""promo videos"" and work and still lists herself in the credits as DUCHESS OF SUSSEX considering she's an american living in america. Its a joke. 

The proof of her political aspirations Are the newspapers and articles saying so. For legal reasons she is never ""quoted"", she instead has her PR team release info.

Meghan never gave a speech about politics as art of her royal duty.. ever.... since That wouldve been absurd. 
Its called meddling in foreign politics.  Or interfering. These are all facts. Just like all the other facts I've stated the duration of this convo that you just ignore. 

It must get old just defending someone for no reason, especially a nobody whose only accomplishments are being a gold digger (and a good one at that i admit)   

Remember when u said she didn't have bot farms too? More proof:     
https://www.macleans.ca/royalty/meghan-markles-twitter-bot-network-the-whole-thing-is-a-bit-insane/"
2715,2020-10-01 17:20:28,hfm3nd,"There's no proof that her PR team was the one that said she wants to run for office. It's just your guess. 

Also show me where I said Meghan has no bots. Since I only said that Meghan has large support in response to you saying that the support is all bots+there are bots hating on her. I already said there are bots created to polarise public figures. This includes dumb worship and dumb hate. 


Also regarding that title issue: That means that the US will not recognise titles in their country. I.e. No Princess of Kentucky, and titled individuals from foreign lands won't be entitled to extra privileges (assuming they're not diplomats/internationally protected people). Politicians etc can still call her by her title if they want to, it's just a title and not extra privilege. It does not mean that Meghan shouldn't use her title, since her title is by virtue of her marriage and would be an insult if she drops it without the Queen's permission. They're also still working with the commonwealth, so while I hope they cut off every single tie to that archaic institution (monarchy) and its people,  I understand them keeping their titles at least until after the review next year. If they still have their titles after, we all will know it's been discussed and permitted by the monarch. You're the one who said it's illegal, now you changed your tune? 

You said you were done with the conversation but you still replied..why? I won't be replying further, lol! Remember to vote ;)"
2716,2020-10-07 18:19:15,hfm3nd,"They ""leak"" all of this info. DUH. Its not guessing, who else would leak any of that?

  Well IT data scientists have said otherwise, see the link proof. 

No there aren't just random botfarms floating around to polarize public figures. Theyre very targeted. And selective. Maybe actually read the article I posted. Its all in the there. 

Its a title of Nobility and its the only reason she's getting work here. Otherwise why didnt she get a 100 mil deal before harry? Why had no one heard of her? Why doesn't she just stop using the title instead of being billed as her royal name on literally everything single thing she does? That is extra privilege. Harry isn't even going by his royal title anymore. He's just called Harry now. Her title was bestowed upon marriage not birthright. If her husband isn't using his then she shouldn't use hers. 

THE commonwealth helps small countries who would otherwise be taken over by nefarious state actors and gives them a voice in govt and parliament.  So I hope they're also cut off from that since they're an insult to the queen, their country and the commonwealth. 

What did I say was illegal? Using a title. I said it isn't ACKNOWLEDGED HERE. and i haven't changed my tune. When did I ?"

2752,2020-06-25 15:00:25,hfkye3,"Obama is part of the same game that Bush is with different aesthetics. Ironically,  even his crowning achievement in Obamaare is just a copy and paste of Republican policy with a woke sales pitch and a couple less morally repugnant additions to make it mildly palatable for those that possess actual souls. 

Here is Adolph Reed talking about Obama directly in 1996:

>In Chicago, for instance, we’ve gotten a foretaste of the new breed of foundation-hatched black communitarian voices; one of them, a smooth Harvard lawyer with impeccable do-good credentials and vacuous-to-repressive neoliberal politics, has won a state senate seat on a base mainly in the liberal foundation and development worlds. His fundamentally bootstrap line was softened by a patina of the rhetoric of authentic community, talk about meeting in kitchens, small-scale solutions to social problems, and the predictable elevation of process over program—the point where identity politics converges with old-fashioned middle-class reform in favoring form over substance.

>I suspect that his ilk is the wave of the future in U.S. black politics, as in Haiti and wherever else the International Monetary Fund has sway."
2753,2020-06-25 17:02:46,hfkye3,"Fantastic quote!   


Perhaps I'm overly optimistic, but I'm hoping time has run out on this model, the ""Obama ilk"", in favour of politicians with a genuine progressive agenda."
2754,2020-06-25 17:31:45,hfkye3,"I dont judge people too harshly for trying to see good and find it where they can. Hell,  I offered my support to the Bernie campaign knowing full well that he would again support whatever ghoul the DNC decided to rat fuck him with in the end.  

Getting on in years though,  I find myself not becoming a Doomer, but analyzing the parts of the politic to understand its greater mass. I am finding that, if every aspect of the system is broken it cannot harbor an agenda that is democratic or genuinely progressive.  When it does,  it does so in only the most meager way as to appease people momentarily. 

Look at people like AOC and Ilhan Omar. After Bernie,  in the American context,  people were calling them the great white hope of new leftism.

Now where are we? Well, they copied up hard to DNC leadership like Pelosi and lent them all their power. Rolling Stone cover group photo, public meetings,  etc without ever publicly calling people like Pelosi out for abusing their vast power. 

AOC dropped all her leftist staff and leadership pretty muchh and spends all her time quietly making sure no one remembers what her campaign platform was,  is now working on one of Bidens task forces which anyone with a brain can tell you is a pr stunt,  and occasionally does woke snap chats. 

Omar went ironically from publicly criticizing AIPAC to signing letters by them to the UN demanding renewed embargoes on Iran. Also has repeatedly backed and given her shine to Pelosi,  even after she CALLED FOR A RESOLUTION IN CONGRESS TO CONDEMN HER AS AN ANTI SEMITE.  LOL

Tldr I don't think it's worthless to be optimistic,  but I think there isnt a lot of reasons to be so."

2771,2020-06-25 13:39:09,hfin85,"Why the fuck is no one in the Middle East ever responsible for anything they do? ISIS killed hundreds of thousands of civilians... so isn't that the fault of the people who joined ISIS, not the Americans? America didn't force the Saudis to go into Yemen, they just went along with it because the Saudis are a key ally in the region... so aren't the Yemeni deaths the Saudis' fault? Likewise, America didn't start the Libyan revolution or the Syrian revolution - they were the result of the brutality and corruption of Ghaddafi and Assad; Obama was reluctant to get involved in Libya until the French basically told him they were aiding the rebels with or without him, and he constantly refused to have a direct US military intervention in Syria. The Libyan and Syrian rebels lobbied heavily for American aid at a time when America was trying to disentangle itself from the region.

As for the Afghanistan war, Bush got America into that - and let's not forget that the Taliban's support for Al Qaeda was a legitimate casus belli. Obama was responsible for *withdrawing* US troops from Afghanistan.

And as for the drone strikes in Pakistan - whose permission do you think he needed for those? Who do you think was providing intelligence for those strikes? The Pakistani government. For years they played a double game, using America to take out their opposition both in Afghanistan and in the tribal areas in Pakistan, while at the same time arming and funding their pet terrorist groups in Afghanistan to give them base of influence once America inevitably withdrew.

Fuck you, and fuck all the Muslims in the Middle East who are more than happy to use America to do their dirty work then turn around and cry about what warmongers they are. You all have more blood on your hands than the Americans, and it's sickening listening to you pretend that you're all just innocent bystanders while you play your double-dealing, back-stabbing games."

2793,2020-06-25 14:38:18,hfin85,"* No he didn't deserve the prize. It was bizarre (and I think he even was uncomfortable about it).
* He's only a criminal, mass murder, and warmonger in so much as any US president, or any head of any empire. No need to single him out. But you are correct if you are pushing back against the idea that some people have that Obama didn't make the decision to kill people. My point is just that *all* presidents decide to kill people, it's part of being president - you direct the military.
* You seem to be mad when he pulls troops out (Iraq) but mad when he sends troops in (Afghanistan). I think you just want to be mad, regardless of the situation. You need to accept the harsh truth that sometimes military action is necessary, sometimes it's unclear what the right action is, and you will always be criticized no matter your decision, especially when it involves killing people. If he had left troops in Iraq and there had been no ISIS and he had pulled out of Afghanistan and Al Qaeda started blowing up civilians in Pakistan, you'd be complaining he pulled out of A and stayed in I. The fact is we don't get to live the alternative history. Obama very likely made the best possible decisions he could given the circumstances (why wouldn't he?).
* I think it's a legitimate complaint that American lives are valued more than the lives of those who are not American. Note that this is mainly a view of the American people (on average). It is simply not politically viable for someone to run for president under the platform ""if it comes down to it, I'll sacrifice americans for people from other countries, if it makes sense to do so.""  One day that will change though, we're just not there yet. So what you get is what you see: most presidents of the US do the minimum needed to appease the public, while doing their best in their personal capacity to do what's right. See also why George W. Bush saved millions of lives in Africa (AIDS charity) while killing enormous numbers of people in the middle east."

As far as the AP goes, no one in the region is beyond reproach & our choice of ""friends"" is embarassing. Yemen is a travesty. Our standards should be higher.    
Side note: American weapons are also used on American citizens this month.

2862,2020-06-25 14:45:51,hfin85,"Truth. If you’re “big” enough to even be nominated, let alone elected. Chances are , you’re dirty. The sad thing is, I believe, the best candidates will never even get nominated. All the big money comes from hard left and hard right special interest groups. Centerist candidates who may actually serve the greater good will never even have a chance. If Joe Biden and Before him, Hillary Clinton is the best the DNC can do? Well..."
2863,2020-06-25 13:36:16,hfin85,Cleanest so far though.
2864,2020-06-25 14:34:28,hfin85,"Anywhere in the world will ever have a clean president. Power corrupts people, and this is what people fail to understand.

Politicians don't care about the people, some will just pretend they do as a market to get them elected, all politicians care about is money and power, and I tell you: power is not means to an end, power IS the end.

As the quote goes: ""if voting changed anything, it probably won't be allowed"""
2865,2020-06-25 16:14:33,hfin85,"Obama did go down and meet with Chavez in Venezuela early on in his Presidency. And his administration did negotiate the Iran nuclear deal.

That’s a huge contrast from Bush’s “Axis of Evil” and “War on Terror” rhetoric."

Barack Obama is responsible for situation in Iraq after American withdrawal when hundreds of thousand of civilians were killed by ISIS. He is also responsible for Situation in Yemen when he supported Saudi intervention i Yemen which killed 50,000 children by starvation. Whole Libya operation was his fault which destabilized the whole region and killed hundred of thousands. In Syria, he opposed their president and supported the insurgency which again killed hundreds of thousands. He increased military presence in Afghanistan and killed thousands of innocents in Drone strikes in the region which made the whole situation worse.  

It is infuriating to see that his successor gets tons of hate on Reddit for killing 1 Iranians general and called a warmonger but somehow Obama is shining beacon of humanity and kindness. He killed millions of innocents through his direct or indirect action but somehow he is a good person."

When the earth smelled of summer
And the sky was streaked with white

And the soft mist of Victor
Was sleeping on a hill
I remember this
And I always will

There are new lovers now on the same silent hill
Looking on the same blue beach
And I know Bridget and I are a part of them all
And they're all a part of Bridget and me

Hello young lovers, wherever you are
I hope your troubles are few
All my good wishes go with you tonight
I've been in love like you

Be brave, young lovers and follow your star
Be brave and faithful and true
Cling very close to each other tonight
I've been in love like you

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels
And to fly down the street in a glance
You fly down a street on the chance that you'll meet
And you meet -- in motor skill dance

Don't cry young lovers, whatever you do
Don't cry because I'm alone
All of my memories are happy tonight
I've had a love of my own

I've had a love of my own, like yours
I've had a love of my own"

We also contribute the most to foreign aid than any other nation amd most nations combined. We lead still in space industry and exploration. We are slacking massivly in the education field these days which is sad and depressing, but to claim that Americans are weak and can't accomplish anything is childish.

3225,2020-06-25 14:55:13,hfin85,"But then they will not know if you agree or not and sending an upvote tells them that: ""I agree with your comment""; ""Your comment is funny""; ""I like your comment"". So yes, it is worth it."
3226,2020-06-27 02:23:10,hfin85,"I do agree with you that it has no inherent value, if I did I would have, as I said, given it a different narrative. I'm here to spread the truth and not to contribute to a hive mind."
3227,2020-06-25 15:29:15,hfin85,"Sorry, why is it obvious that the black economist's blackness *didn't* influence his win, but Obama's blackness *did?*"
3228,2020-06-25 15:47:36,hfin85,"Yea...except during the 2016 campaign his net worth was estimated to be at $682,000 at the high end and  $211,000 at the low end. So he made most of his money recently from book deals and signings. He also owns three homes with the lowest valued at 400k and the highest at 575k. 

Why does he need three homes? He very easily could've donated the money he used to buy his third home to buy 5 homes for needy people. 

Try again."
3229,2020-06-25 15:02:52,hfin85,the only way they wouldn’t know you agree with them using a comment is if you don’t make it clear you agree (it can be as basic as “i agree.”) or if your comment is vague.
3230,2020-06-27 08:53:35,hfin85,spreading the truth doesn’t require positive karma. it’s like if jahova’s witnesses only believed in their truths based on the amount of people answering the door.
3231,2020-06-25 15:31:14,hfin85,"Yeah, and I'm saying the above commenter wasnt talking about a black economist. Because they weren't. They were talking about Obama."
3232,2020-06-25 19:06:17,hfin85,"Yes, because Obama did nothing of value."
3233,2020-06-25 19:13:50,hfin85,"Seems like the Nobel Prize Committee, who's apparently gotten it right >950 times, would know who deserves their prize better than you do."
3234,2020-06-26 00:23:53,hfin85,"But did you know that Hitler was nominated for a nobel prise in 1939 too?  
I suppose that those people who are driven mostly by political fads don't know better after all."

3244,2020-07-30 21:48:45,hfetg2,"Glad to see someone appreciate Persona 5's story and not bash and over simply it to adults bad 

As someone who's first was Persona 5 vanilla it cool to see someone still appreciate the original version post Royal.

For me I always felt Persona 5 had 2 different message since Royal release. Currently on the second palace on Royal and so far love the gameplay chances. But iffy about Maruki. And I already spoiled the story in snippets. Will have full opinion when I finish the game"
3245,2020-06-25 11:31:31,hfetg2,You should post this on the main P5 sub. Great essay!
3246,2020-06-27 02:56:10,hfetg2,"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

- [/r/persona] [Very thorough Vanilla P5 analysis. I wished I played it upon release.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/hglq2f/very_thorough_vanilla_p5_analysis_i_wished_i/)

3247,2020-08-12 16:28:24,hfetg2,"A fun fact about me.  I only purchased and completed P5 because of the descriptions of just *one character,* and it *wasn't* Makoto.

It was *Yaldabaoth.*  A manifestation of human complacency that leads to oppression.

I was curious on how and why Gnosticism was all the rage in JRPGs and why they were suddenly becoming more effective at ""God is Bad"" stories.  Its because these new stories, such as Guilty Gear Xrd, were throwing the generic complaints about ""God"" back at humans.  The primary clap-back these ""bad gods"" have upon humans is *""this is what you wanted, you selfish beasts!""*

And boy, have my expectations been blown away."
3248,2020-11-14 23:49:35,hfetg2,"Honestly I really liked the themes and ideas this game put forward even if in some there are times some more work was needed.

But honestly your post opened my eye to see more than I saw at first, thanks for that!"
3249,2020-06-26 00:38:10,hfetg2,"If someone else wants to share this on r/persona5 or anywhere else, be my guest."
3250,2020-06-25 07:30:19,hfetg2,You have to play royal I'm not kidding you it's that good
3251,2020-08-05 15:50:26,hfetg2,"My pleasure.  After an eight year chip on my shoulder towards Persona and shounen bs, I finally played P5 because I heard the social commentary was aces (and that it did a ""God is Bad/Grownups Are Bad"" story *right*), and I was blown away.

I refuse to spend money on Royal because I rapidly sniffed out Atlus's favorite formulae from their remakes and side games.  It shows me that they learned *nothing* from Marie in eight years *and they don't wan't to*.  And from what I saw on Youtube and TV Tropes, I only got angrier.  I can ignore Kasumi's problems, and she tells an interesting story anyway, but I *can't ignore Maruki.*  Maruki and Kasumi are both, equally *train wrecks.*  But Maruki drags all the messages of P5 with him."
3252,2020-12-21 02:19:12,hfetg2,"Ah, I missed your message.  My pleasure.  P5 is the most thrilling discussion on Japan's problems I have ever seen.

Some people prefer P4 and complain about the villains, wanting more Futabas and P4 esque first world pity-parties (not that Futaba isn't groundbreaking.)  But P5 is absolutely bold."
3253,2020-06-25 13:12:43,hfetg2,"No I don't.  I can get everything I want from Royal via Youtube, such as the better Valentine's Day.

I'm not touching Royal and I'm not encouraging Atlus by spending money on it.  After playing Golden, I'm never playing an Atlus remake again.  Kasumi is a repeat of Persona 4 Golden's problems ([Marie.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/gf3vw2/how_does_it_feel_to_play_p5r/))  Akechi's fake character development is shameless fanservice for the worst fans because Japan cant process someone attractive being a villain.

And most importantly, Maruki is a repeat of Persona 4 Arena's problems (opening up every characters old wounds as if they learned nothing all year and made no friends all year.)  Instead of creating new character strenghts, Atlus dug into their past instead of their present and future to create new *weaknesses* *and emotional dependencies* to create drama where there was none.  Maruki also throws away the themes of P5 to rehash P4.  >!Its a generic Lotus Eater story, doomed to end for all the reasons Lotus Eaters end from every Lotus Eater episode of every sci-fi/fantasy TV show.  P5 was about rebelling against conformity.  Royal is about rebelling against Lotus Eaters.!<

All of this because Atlus refuses to really develop their characters more than once in their remakes, and refuses to flesh out the relationships between the characters that are *not* the player.  (This is why Haru fans hate Royal.  I don't even like Haru and I agree with them because this would have made her better.)

They know its easier to just slap sloppy new characters on the game.  They did it with P3's remake.  They did it with P4 Golden.  They did it with Catherine Full Body.  And they did it with P5R.  They will *never* learn.  I, however, *can.*

Atlus would have to promise ""no new characters,"" ""original writing team,"" and ""more growth between old characters"" for me to buy another remake.  Royal should have stretched Shido and the original final boss later in time and filled the gap with more of the old characters.

I don't like Persona/SMT's combat anymore.  Why would I pay money to suffer through it twice for the same old Atlus formulae?"
3254,2020-06-25 14:01:19,hfetg2,Cause it actually is better than its original counter part and fixed everything golden lacked
3255,2020-06-25 14:02:32,hfetg2,Go outside
3256,2020-06-25 14:02:15,hfetg2,"Nah, I'm good."
3257,2020-06-25 14:09:55,hfetg2,"That's actually up too you kasumi isnt actually like Marie, she is actually introduced to us at the beginning of the game and becomes a staple throughout the whole game, akechi is no longer an auto confidant you actually have to rank him up yourself, now has a backstory, Maruki is actually the best thing about that the game because he actually wants to help you without even thinking of himself, each and every character now has more backstory to themselves and the new palace ruler is amazing in every way (I personally think royals new enemy is possibly the best) and all and all the game really fixes and adds things that were really either lacking or just annoying the original, but hey that's completely up to you cause, you dont have to play it but you cant ignore that it is better than the original"
3258,2020-06-27 02:49:28,hfetg2,"I never hear any refutations about comparing her to Marie other than a ""nyuh-uh"" and an ocean of downvotes.

[Someone perfectly compared her to marie here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/ggk4a3/it_feels_kinda_forced/)  On the bottom.  And all he got was a ""nyuh-uh.""  [And here's some more.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/gf3vw2/how_does_it_feel_to_play_p5r/)

And Maruki is not a therapist.  He's an anime therapist.  [And a terrible one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZfvEYECthc)

I'm not paying $60 for sappy drivel.  Atlus never makes their old characters better in their remakes.  Instead they waste their energy on new ones that don't make sense.

This is why Steam sells Catherine Classic and Catherine Fully Body separately.  They know they screwed up."
3259,2020-06-27 03:22:41,hfetg2,No they thought of a better story I mean I played both games and honestly with how much was added I can say royal is fine but all in all atlus just thought of a better story for persona 5 I honestly like royal and whoever told you they dont expand upon the old characters that's wrong they do like right after kamoshida but hey it's your money
3260,2020-06-27 03:27:10,hfetg2,"Also just because kasumi likes joker doesn't mean its forced they put kasumi everywhere in the game to make up for p4G Marie see her once and she doesn't appear till way later but that's not the case with kasumi she literally becomes a main staple right in the prologue of the game but that doesn't take anything away from the vanilla game she may become a recurring character but that doesn't mean she is forced if anything I'd say makoto is forced more than kasumi I mean she is forced to spy on you, asks to hold your hand in sojiros house and even, etc"
3261,2020-06-27 03:35:48,hfetg2,Marukis ability basically makes him the ultimate therapist also do you know that doctor maruki isnt just a therapist
3262,2020-07-09 01:50:37,hfetg2,"If Maruki was *actually* a therapist he would know about one teeny weeny psychological elephant-in-the-room that makes his plan impossible: *Hedonistic Adaptation,* aka the *Hedonistic Treadmill.*

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic\_treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill)

Giving everyone what they *desire* will not cause humanity to stagnate.  They will only become more ravenous.  When someone gets what they desire, it slowly changes from a cherished joy to an expectation.  Then people create new desires, goals, and dreams.  It fuels humanity's technologies, evolution, cultures, and even its *wars.*

Makoto got her dad back.  Why didn't Sae get the mom back too?  What about Haru's mom?  Why didn't Yusuke want his mom?  What happens when those dads and moms want to be young again?  What happens when Ryuji gets bored of his legs and wants *wings?*  What happens when every girl wants to be Joker's waifu at the same time?  What happens when everyone wants to fly to other plants, become immortal, and become gods like Maruki?

Check out Guilty Gear Xrd, where this psychological problem is studied heavily.

A therapist should know better.  And a game about psychology should know better.  Royal's writers are *hacks.*  I can watch Royal's new Christmas and Valentines Day at my leisure.  I have no reason to waste money on Royal.  I will never buy an Atlus remake again."

but now its fuck *everyone*. so... fuck you. and you, and you and you and you... you're cool.. fuck you.. and fuck you! i'm out."
3318,2020-06-30 13:49:20,hik92n,Ah yes the lawyer who went to Princeton and Harvard and graduated cum laude doesn't seem very smart. Fuck off.
3319,2020-06-30 13:47:00,hik92n,She went to Princeton and Harvard Law and had a successful career on her own before Barack was elected president.
3320,2020-06-30 13:54:28,hik92n,"Dude she tutored her husband. That’s how they met. 

What type of shit are you spewing calling someone you’ve never even met not smart and then assuming some stupid shit?

Seems like you’re quite the dumbass here David"
3321,2020-06-30 13:49:28,hik92n,"I mean given current events, I don't think you need more than that to be president. Having heard her speak, she is intelligent though."
3322,2020-06-30 13:58:17,hik92n,"Yo I made a mistake. 

You’re an old ass boomer who definitely did not graduate from a college and you are ACTIVE in r/teenagers. 

Even trying to explain anything to you about the rigors of school is a lost cause. 

Also wtf are you doing in a teenager subreddit?"
3323,2020-06-30 14:42:39,hik92n,Come on mate I don't dislike America. I have nothing against the civilians of America what I hate is the American military industrial complex that is wreaking havoc all over the globe in order to line the pockets of a few families. I agree if I could swap trump for obama I would. I still think he's a war criminal and he shouldn't be idolised though.
3324,2020-06-30 13:52:01,hik92n,"Aw, is someone mad?  1.  Lawyers aren’t shit lmao.  2. Princeton is one of the easiest “prestigious” schools to get into.  3.  If she was so smart, why did she just get Cum Laude and not Summa Cum Laude?"
3325,2020-06-30 14:00:04,hik92n,1.  David is not my name.  2.  Obama is retarded so I would expect a retard to tutor a retard.
3326,2020-06-30 13:59:02,hik92n,You don’t know shit about me lmao😂😂😂
3327,2020-06-30 13:55:24,hik92n,"David, would you care to enlighten us as to your alma mater and GPA?"
3328,2020-06-30 13:59:11,hik92n,I'm sorry your fragile ego is threatened by people smarter and more successful than you.
3329,2020-06-30 13:59:24,hik92n,Why are you active in r/teenagers
3330,2020-06-30 14:03:41,hik92n,"Dude. One look at your history tells me everything I need to know about you. 

Like I’m at a pretty low point in my life right now and after seeing your post history I realized that even at my worst I’m still not as much of a failure as you are. Thank you so much for cheering me up."
3331,2020-06-30 14:16:06,hik92n,"He’s either (hopefully) still a teenager who hasn’t gotten into college. 

Or he’s never went to college in the first place. Based on the fact that he’s active in r/teenagers it would seem like he’s more likely to drive around the local middle and high school rather than the nearby university. 

Why the fuck is this piece of shit active in a teenager subreddit"
3332,2020-06-30 13:59:27,hik92n,David isn’t my name lol
3333,2020-06-30 14:00:23,hik92n,I am too😩😩😩😩
3334,2020-06-30 14:00:30,hik92n,Why can’t I be
3335,2020-06-30 14:09:05,hik92n,"As I’ve said, you know nothing about me.  You know how I am here on Reddit, but not how I am in the real world.  If you think that people behave online the same way they do in real life, you are very naive.  If looking through my account to dig up dirt on me is what it takes to cheer you up, then so be it.  It’s pretty sad though, you tell me talking shit on others is wrong yet do the same.  It’s a painful irony my friend.  Have fun with whatever it is you’re doing I guess and never forget that you got so mad over a comment on Reddit that you went through someone’s account just to discredit them, not for what they were saying.  Peace out ✌️."
3336,2020-06-30 20:56:16,hik92n,"That's definitely the important part of my comment, thank you."
3337,2020-06-30 14:46:28,hik92n,Cause it's weird and gross.
3338,2020-06-30 14:11:58,hik92n,"If anything the way people behave online (i.e., anonymously) says more about their true nature than how they behave in the “real world”. 

Why the fuck are you active in a subreddit made for teenagers?"
3339,2020-06-30 14:46:57,hik92n,Why is it weird for a teenager to be on a subreddit for teenagers?
3340,2020-06-30 14:13:29,hik92n,How do you know I’m not a teenager?
3341,2020-06-30 14:13:47,hik92n,Also people give themselves fake personas online all of the time
3342,2020-06-30 14:47:41,hik92n,It's not. Are you a teenager?
3343,2020-06-30 14:19:56,hik92n,"So your racist and “le edgy” cringe factor post history is you acting?

In real life you’re an upstanding citizen who volunteers at the local homeless shelter and stands up for minorities (especially ones who get berated by police officers)?

I hope you are a teenager who will one day grow up and realize how wrong his opinions are. Because the alternative is just so fucking disgusting."
3344,2020-06-30 14:48:09,hik92n,That’s what I said
3345,2020-06-30 14:22:50,hik92n,"No offense my friend, but Reddit isn’t a place I like to take advice.  If you can’t take a joke that’s on you, not me.  My “opinions” are shitty jokes that, surprise surprise, I find funny.  Idc how bad they are, morally or just not funny wise.  Also, minorities attack each other more than they are attacked by cops, but no one wants to talk about that."
3346,2020-06-30 14:33:32,hik92n,"Holy shit. You really are fucked up. Pay attention in your math class if you’re still in high school. But Stay away from high school if you’re no longer a teenager you sick fuck. 

Also all I said was minorities who were being berated by police officers and your mind immediately jumped to the thing that racist incels go to when they want to deflect from the fact that they’re racist."
3347,2020-06-30 14:35:06,hik92n,Whatever you say bro✌️
3348,2020-06-30 14:44:32,hik92n,"Look, fighting back and forth over something so trivial isn’t worth it to me.  If I offended you, I’m sorry.  If I made you mad over something, I’m sorry.  It’s not worth fighting on an app that’s meant to bring joy to people.  As I said, I’m sorry, let’s please go about our day."
3349,2020-06-30 14:56:32,hik92n,"I appreciate your civility.

But you’re either a pedophile attempting to groom teenagers or you’re a teenager with a shitty mindset."
3350,2020-06-30 14:57:54,hik92n,"I know my comments don’t paint me in a good light, but I hope it’s obvious I’m just a teenager who’s saying shit to say shit."
3351,2020-06-30 15:04:39,hik92n,Well then change man. Nobody’s gonna want anything to do with you if you don’t.
3352,2020-06-30 15:07:14,hik92n,"I get that, it’s just as a kid it’s fun to dick around you know?  I know when to be sensible and not act like a jackass, but sometimes it’s just fun to say retarded stuff.  I guess this is the wrong sub for that."

So recently I came under fire by my friends. I have had my Twitter account for about three months now, I have a slight interest in politics and think politics are pretty cool and interesting. I am a 14-year-old Democrat who follows all sorts of people. My father Pete Buttigieg, Michelle Obama, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and I decided to follow Donald Trump, I had heard a lot about his tweets and my curiosity caused me to decide to follow him. (Just a disclaimer I’m gonna need some Democrats to answer this question because of my political bias and the people who confronted me are Democrats and I want to know from a Democratic standpoint.) So I was going to sleep just now and my friend texted me talking about how our best friend follows Trump on Instagram. And then I told her that I follow Trump on Twitter and she told her friend who then both texted me about how it was wrong.I didn’t see how it was wrong because I didn’t think that if you followed someone on Twitter it meant you followed them politically. I was just curious about the topic and wanted to see the kind of things he tweeted about. I never liked one of his tweets, except for by accident. I was browsing Twitter when I saw the controversy about Woodrow Wilson and the university and whenever I’m on Twitter I instinctively like things, because the things on my feed are going to be things that I like, so I like trumps tweets and then unlike them but this time I forgot. But that’s not the point, the point is is that they continued to tell me about how it was wrong to follow him but I kept attempting to justify it with the fact that I was just curious I didn’t really support him, but they really didn’t buy it. I’m very confused on what to do. I wrote a very lengthy apology in which I unfollowed him which I still intend to do but I just want to know if I am the asshole.

For the record I did all this in text to speech so I apologize if there any issues.

Also if you want numbers of vehicles and Army size here is a good source about the types of combat units used by the US Army.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigade_combat_team

Note that my source talks about brigades, while you mostly mention divisions, so the source might not be too useful. But you may find it to be a good starting point. 

The source includes stuff like types of brigades, and numbers of soldiers and vehicles in a brigade. I imagine your fictional country would adopt a lot of this structure, since it seems to be closely based on the US. Im not saying your units are wrong, but my advice might be to look up a few divisions/brigades of the actual US Army, to get a feel of what they look like in terms of size and organization.

Admitetdly, this last one kinda feels like nit picking to me.

But the size of your Navy feels kinda short on manpower given the number and type of ships. The real life US Navy has about 300 ships, and 330,000 Active sailors. You have 1/6 the ships, but 1/12 the manpower. I think the Navy would need more people. Note that a sizable chunk of sailors would be at shore facilities supporting activities from there.

Unfortunately, that level of detail makes it a lot easier to nitpick.

> For some context, my world takes place in the year 2027, *just close to a decade* ever since the Black Flu pandemic ripped across the human race and the zombies initiated the Great Collapse, leading to the fall of modern civilization. The US Government was able to somewhat survive and in *2009 under the leadership of President Obama*

There's a dating problem here - just close to a decade from 2027 would put the Black Flu striking in 2017-8ish, meaning it's a bit late for President Obama to be leading anything, least of all in 2009. Did you perhaps mean two decades?

> United States Garrison (U.S.G.)

...Sorry, that name is just *wrong*. Firstly, there's no reason to rename the United States Armed Forces, or any of their constituent elements - nothing is gained by doing so, and plenty lost (tradition and legitimacy, both *very* important to a remnant government). It's not as if the USG or its branches are fundamentally different in purpose or organisation: save for the elimination of the Marines (...weird, given that the guy in charge is a Jarhead) and Coast Guard (okay, less weird), the Ground Force, Air Wing, and Naval Fleet are obviously the Army, Air Force and Navy, so there's no real reason not to just call them that.

Secondly, even if you were to rename it, you wouldn't call it that. A garrison is a specific thing, which this is not. (Similarly, Wing and Fleet refer to specific formations. They shouldn't and wouldn't be used to refer to the entire force.)

Certainly given circumstances the US government would be reorganising the forces remaining to it, but it would make more sense for the DC forces to be organised under a new [Unified Combatant Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_combatant_command) or similar - perhaps call it USDCCOM (United States District of Columbia COMmand) or USEMERCOM (United States EMERgency Command). Alternatively it could still be just what's left of USNORTHCOM.

> Active Duty: 62,216 Troopers

That's a lot, given a population of 810,000. Specifically, unless my maths is wrong that's 76.8 active duty personnel per 1000 capita - for comparison, the highest in the world right now is North Korea, at only 50.4 per 1000 capita.

Now, I'm not saying that's wrong as such - one would expect it to be a highly militarised state. What I am saying is it's unsustainable, particularly if they want to retain a military of any quality. North Korea only manages to sustain its numbers on Chinese largess, and its troops are awful. (For reference, the highest active soldiers per 1000 capita from anyone sane is Israel at 20.1 - and they once again have a lot of help and trade from outside.)

More generally, the idea of the United States government only controlling this relatively tiny area yet apparently being able to operate large and complex forces over a wide area, to the point of even still being a superpower, is... difficult to believe. For example:

> USS Harry S. Truman (Nimitz-class aircraft carrier) (Fleet Flagship)

Operating a *Nimitz* is incredibly expensive and complex. Yes, the reactor is good for 20 years if nothing goes wrong, but there's far more to it than that, especially if you want to run the planes on it as well. I admit I'm not an expert, but I sincerely doubt that the diverse resources needed to do that can be got from the DC+ area alone.

Even if they can, it's a fairly dubious use of resources when your main enemies are zombies and militias, but I can see them doing it for political reasons if the could.

A number of the other ships you've mentioned are based in very distant ports - for example *Essex* is based in San Diego and depending on when your dates were actually meant to be is either under repairs when the Black Flu hits, or is even further away in Asia. The idea of the government remnants not maintaining any other permanent bases yet somehow managing to get in contact with a ship a world away then get it either through Panama (probably blocked) or round South America seems incredible. *Kurt Chew Een Lee* seems even more so, because after searching I can't find any ships by that name, so it must have been built after the Flu hit - and I don't think even the DoD's sense of priorities is *that* bad.

And frankly, it seems very unlikely that DC is all they've got anyway. There are clearly surviving powers elsewhere in the United States, ones which they have solid contact with - you're telling me that *none* of them are answering to the President anymore? Even with zombies, a decade is a very short time for all national loyalty to disappear.

In my view, a more likely scenario for a military like this is for DC to be the core of the remnant federal government, but for there to be numerous other loyalist enclaves scattered around the US (particularly the coast, and very particularly the East Coast), all operating with a great deal of latitude but at least nominally still answering to the legitimate central government as much as they can, and generally working together (albeit with much arguing and butting of heads) to restore the US proper. (And admittedly, likely a fair few who claim to be loyal for appearance's sake but are scheming behind DC's back, as well as some uncontacted settlements and some actual rebels and separatists.) 

Such a support network, however tenuous it might be, would much better explain how DC is able to retain such a large and advanced military (and why it might bother with such things as aircraft carriers despite controlling an area around the same size as Northern Ireland, as opposed to just investing in more guns, cars and CAS to clear out Baltimore.)

Additionally, one part of the US military is conspicuous by its absence - they haven't got any nukes. At the very least, the *Ohio*s would likely still be around and reporting to any remaining legitimate government."

> 
> 

Again, *no*. Randomly renaming everything and doing a needless structural overhaul does not save a penny - quite the opposite.

You seem to be under the impression that a three-branch military (which is what yours is, even if it pretends to be otherwise - you have what is obviously an army, navy and an air force, no matter what you call them) is somehow automatically more efficient than a five-branch one. This is not the case. Obviously one would need to restructure quite a lot to deal with having a population the size of Guyana, but there's no gain to actually getting rid of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard - you just confuse everything and piss a load of people off for no good reason. 

The idea of a single force is particularly unlikely. There is a reason no country of note does that - Army, Navy and Air Force are sufficiently distinct that they cannot be meaningfully combined. The set up you've given *is* a de-facto three branch military.

It's particularly bad because the main threats confronting the remnant US are more within the USMC and USCG's areas of expertise than any of the others.

And even if for some damnfool reason they did get rid of the Marines and CG, there's still absolutely no reason to rename the Army, Navy and Air Force, not least to names which are actively inaccurate and misleading (the Garrison is not a Garrison, since it's a mobile force projecting power over a wide area. The Wing is not a Wing, because it's rather bigger than an OF-4. etc.).

The restructuring into the 'Garrison' is an incredibly unrealistic and impractical idea. The US Armed Forces already have an established thing for multi-branch commands, the aformentioned Unified Combatant Command, which is perfectly appropriate to this situation.

> What would be a more realistic number of troops in the military if 62,216 AD Troopers is unsustainable?

Again, I said *unsustainable*, not *wrong*. Countries at war often have unsustainably large forces, simply because they have no intention of sustaining them. 

As for what they could sustain, I'd say Israel might be a reasonable model - say 20ish Active Duty per 1000 citizens. (That's very much eyeballing it of course, since there isn't a comparable real life situation.)

The things that are unquestionably a problem are the heavier units. There is no way a region the approximate size of Northern Ireland and population of Bhutan with no external supply chain are maintaining an Aircraft Carrier. Full stop.

> Both the USS Kurt Chew Een Lee and Lewis Chesty Puller are a new class of warships in my world called the battlecarrier, which was developed and built around the 90s’ under a joint-Navy and Marine Corps program (so a bit of an “alternate history” twist).

I see, I assumed you were referring to the *actual* [Chesty Puller class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Lewis_B._Puller_(ESB-3)), which is a mobile base vessel and entirely reasonable thing for DC to have around.

That actually makes it even less plausible. By a lot. 

So, assuming the link is comparable (one assumes it can't be exactly the same, because you said 'built' rather than 'converted' and they're not called *Iowa*), that starts with the suggestion that the USN developed hybrid carriers in the 90s. Which would be fairly daft of them (as the IJN proved to their detriment, hybrid carriers are not a particularly good idea, and battleships haven't stopped being obsolete), but fine - it's not as if they're never daft, they kept the *Iowa*s around well past their sell-by date.

The Marine Corps involvement seems... unlikely. Carriers and Battleships are both firmly Navy territory. They'd insist the USMC has no business operating them, and they'd be right. 

But regardless of the pre-Flu circumstances, the idea of what is functionally a tiny city state operating *three* Carrier-equivalents is ludicrous. That's more than any country other than the US operates today.

If you want it to seem at all plausible, either give them more territory or take away some of their stuff. I personally recommend the former."

- The Garrison is named what it is since it’s guarding and defending the remains of the United States as well as garrisoning the land that it captures. 

- The Air Wing is called that for administrative purposes as well as due to the fact that it’s a “wing” of the Garrison. But I can see the confusion and I might change the name. 

- The battlecarrier was a joint-Navy and Marine Corps project since the battlecarrier was meant to act as a modern floating heavily armed fortress capable of supporting and helping to sustain a Marine amphibious landing via naval artillery, missile strikes, and air support.

3469,2020-07-01 00:07:29,hi1g9p,"> I wouldn’t call the Garrison a purely 3-branched military

What you would 'call it' is immaterial. It obviously is. It's a military, and it's got a bit that is obviously an army, a bit that is obviously a navy, and a bit that is obviously an air force.

It *is* a three branch military de-facto.

> I’m trying to follow the organizational and operational structure of a MAGTF as close as possible what with the whole combined arms strategy that goes along with a MGTF (except replace the logistics arm with a naval arm).

Firstly, no you are not. 'Except replace the logistics arm with a naval arm' is not some small change, it *completely* changes *everything* such as to render the original basis useless. 

Secondly - the above would assume the original basis had any relevance to the situation, which MAGTF does not. At all. A MAGTF is intended to operate and sustain itself independently for, at most, *60 days*. It is not a model for a permanent entire military, and the idea that the United States Government - still mostly being run by the same officials and officers who were in it IRL before things went wrong - would for some unfathomable reason choose to restructure the entire military in its image - or rather, a bastardised version of its image that really isn't very close to the original at all, as can be seen by the inclusion of *Carrier Battle Groups* - is just wrong.

For the third time of asking, the US Armed Forces already have an established system for a regional command which works perfectly here. Use that. 

> The Garrison is named what it is since it’s guarding and defending the remains of the United States as well as garrisoning the land that it captures.

No, it bloody well isn't. 

> the U.S. Garrison has *spearheaded combat operations, peacekeeping missions, and humanitarian aid services* throughout the East Coast while also working to diligently defend the District of Columbia from hostile invaders

Now, you *might* have heard of an American military organisation IRL that, apart from defending US soil, also goes around doing interventions and humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping missions. They're called the *United States Armed Forces*. Because that is what you call your armed forces, not naming them after one particular mission type that is only a small part of what they do. (Even those militaries in the world whose *only* purpose is static defence of their nation... shockingly, do not call themselves garrisons. They call themselves Armed Forces.)

(And even if they were just a *garrison*, which they aren't, why would a garrison model itself after an *expeditionary force*? And why would a government still claiming to be a superpower, and the legitimate rulers of territories far beyond what it actually controls, give its entire military such a name, breaking their legitimacy by throwing away the very oldest traditions of the nation they still claim to be?)

> Just our of curiosity, why are hybrid battleships-aircraft carriers a bad idea? 

[doing this one before the previous because it leads into the other]

It *really* isn't. Basically, a hybrid battleship-carrier is bad at either role - carriers are supposed to stay well out of gun range, so either it's useless as a battleship or it's pointlessly endangering the carrier.

Additionally, battleships are obsolete. Have been since WW2. Arguably before then. 

>The battlecarrier was a joint-Navy and Marine Corps project since the battlecarrier was meant to act as a modern floating heavily armed fortress

'Modern' 'Floating heavily armed fortress' - pick any one. They weren't going to be re-enacting Jutland before the Black Flu, they certainly won't be now.

> supporting and helping to sustain a Marine amphibious landing via naval artillery, missile strikes, and air support

Again, missions which are diametrically opposed to each other - if the carrier is close enough for guns to matter, something has gone horribly, *horribly* wrong.

> The Navy wanted the Marine Corps’ input

Among the USN's many fine traits, 'wanting anyone else's input' has rarely been among them. Least of all the Marines. (After all, the USN claims that stands for My Ass Rides In Navy Equipment Sir. That's the polite version.)

> And no, Marines weren’t going to become the crew of a battlecarrier, it’s still gonna be a Navy warship. 

Then it's not a joint Navy-Marines project. 

> Think of it like an amphibious assault ship where Marines are hosted but it’s a Navy-ran ship.

Interesting idea. [It's been done.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Navy_amphibious_warfare_ships)

> How big would the land size and population be in order to properly support the current military force that I have?

Hard to give a clear answer - 'how big a military could a post-apocalyptic state handle' isn't something which has attracted a great deal of scholarship. For one thing, it's based heavily on resource access so what land you have matters - in particular you need a way to get oil.

Back of the envelope numbers, I'd suggest anywhere from 20 to 100 times the current numbers based on comparison to other IRL militaries. (Without the ~~Garrison Naval Fleet~~ *Navy*'s three giant floating white elephants you could probably cut that down quite a lot.)"

Standing in front of crowds of screaming white college students yelling his usual list of impossible promises was basically his whole shtick.

3491,2020-08-20 19:35:29,idc7fj,I don’t really understand her career. Her wiki is that she left Brown’s doctorate program and then just became an editor for the Post. Did she just fall up being the only leftist Catholic? Honestly just curious
3492,2020-08-20 21:55:39,idc7fj,"That chart is interesting in that you see how, with a couple of exceptions, there's a pretty noticeable pattern of women giving the night a better score than men. I'll have to look at what they rated the other two nights, but it's interesting that for the most part the men were not as happy (relatively speaking - the one score of 4 was the only bad score) with a night that mostly focused on women."
3493,2020-08-20 20:16:56,idc7fj,"in addition to what people have said here, the NYT is too psyched out by people thinking it’s “the liberal media” so it feels like they have to be the sad trumpet all the time."

3495,2020-08-20 16:37:14,idc7fj,Oh man I remember during the debates how in the corner of certain candidates each of them were.  You could guess the ratings they gave each candidate without even reading it.  I think someone did the standard deviation and they all basically gave each candidate the same rating every debate regardless of performance.
3496,2020-08-20 17:20:57,idc7fj,"I’m always reminded of how out of touch the NYT is when I see these stupid straw polls. All through the primary debates, it was everyone jerking each other off about Bernie and being like “hmmm buuuuut moderates can’t excite the baaase”"

His eloquence and poise are such a stark contrast to Trump's abrasive word salad. Agree or disagree with his actual politics, Obama is what a leader should sound like."

I live through the Cuban missile crisis, the Kennedy assassination, the Cold war, Vietnam war, the oil embargo, 2K, and 911. I did not feel the same level of dread as I do now.  I'm a Republican, but this Republican president is not up to the job and seems to have an anti-American agenda.   I honestly don't know if America will survive until January 20th.  We are so divided, it is difficult to have conversations with family members on the other political side. It's been a great ride, but this might be the end."

If you keep adding that kind of power to the executive branch someone like Trump is an inevitability. As a whole Trump is more destructive to our freedoms, I agree. However I can't think of any single action by itself that is worse than making it legal to kill American citizens without trial."

However, he's got the timeline wrong. Biden's been the forerunner ever since Super Tuesday which was before Corona hit America. The emphasis on Biden's experience in grief and overcoming it, even playing a sound snippet of Biden addressing the Corona losses, is too much and leaves out other more important reasons why he got the nomination in the first place."

The only thing they have is hearsay about this person meeting with this person here. 

For example the meeting with Trump Jr. It stated in the report that they confirmed he met with a Russian oligarch to allegedly  “receive information on the Clinton campaign.” However, it also stated that the information discussed in the meeting was unconfirmed.

To put this simply, my objective analysis of the report shows a common theme of “no evidence found” combined with bits and pieces of people meeting under certain assumed circumstances that are unsubstantiated as far as evidence goes."

https://www.breitbart.com/news/senate-panel-finds-russia-interfered-in-the-2016-us-election/

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump campaign’s interactions with Russian intelligence services during the 2016 presidential election posed a “grave” counterintelligence threat, a Senate panel concluded Tuesday as it detailed how associates of Donald Trump had regular contact with Russians and expected to benefit from the Kremlin’s help.

The nearly 1,000-page report, the fifth and final one from the Republican-led Senate intelligence committee on the Russia investigation, details how Russia launched an aggressive effort to interfere in the election on Trump’s behalf. It says the Trump campaign chairman had regular contact with a Russian intelligence officer and that other Trump associates were eager to exploit the Kremlin’s aid, particularly by maximizing the impact of the disclosure of Democratic emails hacked by Russian intelligence officers."

Who was forced to plea after his family was threatened by Mueller attack dogs and where even the investigating officers in 302s didn’t think that he was lying to them. And as such, DOJ has asked that all charges be dropped now.

Indicted but not convicted on charges of a supposedly criminal activity after leaving the White House.

He already has taken billions from China through his son, Hunter —a coke addled degenerate.

Mueller's investigators described Kilimnik as someone with ties to Russian intelligence(whatever that means and yet unproven), the committee called him ""a Russian intelligence officer"". This change is nothing but politics being played a political body. 

> shared data with them and attempted to obtain stolen Trump campaign materials from them? If Biden's son sought their help in obtaining materials stolen from Trump?

If you are referring to meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya, who is being called, again, as individuals with “ties to” Russian Government or a Russian intelligence officer according to you is a actually a private lawyer. She was allowed in to US on numerous occasions by Preet Bharara, a Obama appointee, on immigration parole —where all requirements needed to enter U.S are waived— and it’s safe to say, that a Russian intelligence officer wouldn’t be allowed on those grounds. So your comparisons are odious and highly inaccurate.

It has both Republicans and Democrats on th committee. And this committee is one of the standard bearers of Neocon foreign policy which advocates for foreign incursions to spread “democracy” and national building. And Trump ran against those policies and more or less followed through on that. If you think there isn’t any infra-party politics being played by establishment Republicans just like establishment Democrats did against Bernie Sanders by simultaneously dropping out and endorsing Biden while leaving Pocahontas in the race to eat in to Bernie’s vote share, then you are truly a babe in the woods. 

>  Biden has taken “billions” from China.

China. How is it that a guy who has been a failure all his life get to be on board of Chinese communist party run equity firm!

That Trump poses a unique danger, and that his removal is essential for any kind of progress, are both true.

>They understand that in this democracy, the commander in chief doesn’t use the men and women of our military, who are willing to risk everything to protect our nation, as political props to deploy against peaceful protesters on our own soil. They understand that political opponents aren’t “un-American” just because they disagree with you; that a free press isn’t the “enemy” but the way we hold officials accountable; that our ability to work together to solve big problems like a pandemic depends on a fidelity to facts and science and logic and not just making stuff up.  
>  
>None of this should be controversial. These shouldn’t be Republican principles or Democratic principles. They’re American principles. But at this moment, this president and those who enable him, have shown they don’t believe in these things.

&#x200B;

>Democracy was never meant to be transactional

&#x200B;

>They believe that no one — including the president — is above the law, and that no public official — including the president — should use their office to enrich themselves or their supporters.

&#x200B;

>Well, here’s the point: \[*ed note: see look how he signposted this and you still missed it!*\] this president and those in power — those who benefit from keeping things the way they are — they are counting on your cynicism. They know they can’t win you over with their policies. So they’re hoping to make it as hard as possible for you to vote, and to convince you that your vote doesn’t matter. That’s how they win. That’s how they get to keep making decisions that affect your life, and the lives of the people you love. That’s how the economy will keep getting skewed to the wealthy and well-connected, how our health systems will let more people fall through the cracks.

3651,2020-08-20 18:23:56,id9nw7,"Changes in the Constitution would be nice.  For the moment, I'd settle for Biden's following through on his extensive commitments, and junking the legislative filibuster while he's at it.

In that regard, progressive analyst Eric Levitz hears a discordant note from Ted Kaufman, one of Biden's closest associates:

https://twitter.com/EricLevitz/status/1296427890083602440

Kaufman told reporters that it would be hard to achieve a substantial increase in federal spending in 2021, because of the deficits now being incurred; as a result, ""'We're going to be limited.'""

Biden's proposed program costs out at about $3.5 trillion.  So as Levitz observes, ""Either Ted Kaufman considers $3.5 trillion+ to be 'limited,' or Biden has already sacrificed his purported agenda to the Gods of austerity."""

3654,2020-08-20 13:39:32,id9nw7,"You know that's because of the shutdown. I've been against it from the beginning. Now Fauchi came in screaming about 2.5 Million people about to die and I'm guessing Trump responded with the shutdown because he doesn't know who this career appointee is and Trump couldn't risk dismissing him. Now maybe Trump knew or had a feeling that it was all political, I don't know, but I think his first reaction was to do everything in his power to save lives. 

As time went on however Trump realized that this was all political. Obama blamed Trump for EVERY LAST ONE of the Covid deaths. I mean, Obama didn't blame himself for a SINGLE West Nile or Norovirus death. Sure, that's hypocritical of Obama but that's politics. You blame the other guy and pretend you're clean and pure as the wind driven snow. 

Trump did something BRILLIANT though. Trump held a press conference and said that he had ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY to reopen the country. You see, Trump figured out it was political. The Democrats AND THEIR MEDIA screamed that he can't do that. YOU'RE NOT A DICKTATER they screamed! 

Trump walked back the comment and said that he's leaving it up to the governors to make the right decisions. Some governors stayed open and they're doing better. Some enjoy the power and people are still suffering, like here in Michigan. 

Those jobs CAN'T come back until governors open the doors. And believe me, people KNOW who's to blame. I was hoping Biden would choose Whitmer because he would get TROUNCED in Michigan. 

I am optimistic that she is so hated.....no, LOATHED here in Michigan that more people will show up because they hate her than because they hate Trump. Don't doubt me on this, it's possible."
3655,2020-08-20 23:26:13,id9nw7,"Or maybe deficits don't matter until they suddenly do.  I have a feeling the US could incur a lot more debt before it becomes a problem, but when it becomes a problem it will be a very nasty one very quickly...  it's wise to be cognizant of that, but not at the expense of a functioning economy as we fight off covid."

It shows the hit NM took by shutting down, and it also shows how the economy of Arizona, which reopened early soon dropped to do worse than New Mexico, despite being ""open,"" because the spread of disease is destructive to the economy even if all the doors of business are open.  In the last month, it got still worse for AZ and while NM has been stable -- *and* fewer people have died."

It still stands pretty much.

If the virus is entirely ignored expect deaths in the low millions. Now if those million or two people just could be accurately identified and would quietly zip themselves into their bag the maybe the country could survive that. But for every one person who dies  there are five to twenty who get sick enough to be at risk of maybe being the one who dies and they all demand treatment and resources to make sure it's not them.

Hrm.... 

Where to start taking that apart... 

Like please when did Trump order a shutdown? I'll save you the google. Trump never ordered any shutdown. States and municipalities did. And the ones that did have managed the pandemic better than the places that reluctantly shut down and then raced to open first. Similarly places with mask mandates are managing much better than places without. Trump first wore a mask in July, IIRC. Maybe June. And all the Trump lovers who were anti-mask suddenly wanted a POTUS mask... 

I dunno guy, just on the amount of nonsense in the one sentence I pulled, you might do better to listen a bit around these parts and write a little less."
3666,2020-08-20 14:06:17,id9nw7,"That's kind of just admitting that in the middle of a national emergency Trump lacked Leadership. Imagine if during WW2 FDR had simply let each State do their own thing while sabotaging their efforts anyway? We'd be speaking German...

Thank God some Governors stepped up, they could have just taken the Trump route and let the counties handle it while wailing from the sidelines, and the Counties could have done the same and let individual sub-divisions handle it. Who needs leadership when you ""take no responsibility at all""?"

You don't mess around with a new virus when it's deadly, spreads easily, and no one has immunity to it until after they are infected with it."

3757,2020-09-07 13:56:17,io6u8y,You
3758,2020-09-08 02:56:01,io6u8y,Joe
3759,2020-09-07 14:09:22,io6u8y,Both sides.
3760,2020-09-07 14:19:14,io6u8y,Who tf even mentioned Trump here? When making this post there isn't even another comment in this entire thread bringing up Trump aside from this. Living rent free in your head dude. Yikes.
3761,2020-09-08 00:14:32,io6u8y,Then wait who are you criticizing?
3762,2020-09-07 17:24:41,io6u8y,"Then why do you take issue with pointing out his foreign policy, deportations and neoliberalism? Why did you pull the 'Hitler' comparison out of your arse when no such comparison was made?"
3763,2020-09-07 13:58:41,io6u8y,Yep. Am moron. You caught me.
3764,2020-09-07 14:30:22,io6u8y,"It’s probably just cause on this sub every 4th or 5th post is someone trying to dog trump for karma, it just gets annoying, we get it, he’s the worst, there’s more comedic value in like almost anything else. Plz for the love of god"
3765,2020-09-08 01:53:53,io6u8y,The guy that said Obama upheld white supremacy. Did he commit war crimes? Totally. Did he uphold white supremacy? I strongly disagree.
3766,2020-09-07 17:33:16,io6u8y,"I DIDN'T take issue with the dude pointing out Obama's policies. It was specifically the ""black man upholding white supremacy"" part I had an issue with. Even YOU said that the guy took it too far with that.

If somebody said ""Trump is a terrible president and a satanist"", I would call them out, not because I think Trump is a good president but because I don't think he's a satanist."
3767,2020-09-07 15:05:58,io6u8y,"It's probably because this dude's victim complex makes him think that any criticism of anything is a personal attack on Trump, and therefore on anyone who hitches their wagon to that dead horse."
3768,2020-09-07 18:06:42,io6u8y,"It is not a crazy far fetched idea to say that the US' policies, especially those for drugs and imprisonment, are based on racism. I don't think it makes Obama a white supremacist but you pulling the whole 'basically Hitler' shit is a cop out."
3769,2020-09-07 22:11:42,io6u8y,"The link between Obama and white supremacy was made to show the hypocrisy of today's politic where everything is orange man bad,  ""racist"".  when his predecessor was doing some of the exact same things and wasn't criticized because he was black.  But if a white man does it,  suddenly it becomes racism.      

To miss that is the real face palm."
3770,2020-09-07 15:08:21,io6u8y,"Most of the stuff here is usually some kind of “oh he’s so stupid, I hate him” stuff so I mean it’s rarely just criticizing his glaring faults lol. But I get your point and I don’t really disagree, though I’m willing to give this guy the benefit of the doubt and believe he doesn’t have a victim complex, just tired of the saturation of “orange man bad”."
3771,2020-09-07 18:26:09,io6u8y,"> the US' policies, especially those for drugs and imprisonment, are based on racism.

I agree. I believe minorities were targeted and disproportionately punished during the war on drugs.

> I don't think it makes Obama a white supremacist

I agree. 

> you pulling the whole 'basically Hitler' shit is a cop out.

Dude, have you never heard a joke before? The only reason I said that is because Obama's middle name starts with ""H"" lol. It's not that deep."
3772,2020-09-07 15:17:46,io6u8y,The original post had absolutely nothing to do with Trump.... Homeboy straight up took offense to something non-existent. There is no doubt to benefit from.

But Obama didn't call dead soldiers ""suckers"", something even [the national security correspondent at Fox News confirmed Trump said.](https://www.businessinsider.com/fox-news-correspondent-confirms-trump-said-dead-us-troops-losers-2020-9) Obama didn't [withhold sanctions against Argentina while they reviewed his trademark applications.](https://www.citizensforethics.org/trump-argentina-trademarks/) Obama didn't have [a dozen of his closest advisors under indictment.](https://www.axios.com/trump-associates-convicted-mueller-investigations-206295a1-5abc-4573-be25-4da19d9adcc9.html) Obama [authorized a commando operation to kill or capture the most wanted man in the world,](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/magazine/what-pakistan-knew-about-bin-laden.html) a man who knew he was wanted and had been in hiding for years.

And now his re-election strategy seems to be that only Donald Trump can save us from Donald Trump's America."
3799,2020-09-06 03:56:07,inep4d,"First, Obama had real, relevant political experience. In fact, every single president we've ever had before Trump had either significant elected experience or flag-level military experience. Most presidents were formerly state governors or vice president. 

Next, Obama knew the law. Used to be professor of constitutional law. Trump demonstrates nearly every single day that he doesn't have the first clue how the government works, and breaks the law (and *tries* to break the law) on a continuous basis.

We first learned that Russia was meddling in our elections when Obama was president, and he took the ONLY official action taken against Russia to date on that, he expelled several Russian ""diplomats"" that we knew were involved in the program. To date, the strongest action Trump has taken in response to a **semi-hostile foreign government interfering in America's elections** is to kiss Putin's ass and tell us what a swell guy Pootie is.

And while all presidents lie now and then, Trump does it professionally. To date, he has told over 20,000 *verifiable* lies.

And most importantly, Obama isn't a racist, sexist, vulgarian, narcissistic juvenile dimwitted toddler. He understood he was the president of *everyone,* not merely those who voted for him and then continued to kiss his ass. 

>after bombing 7 different nation

When Bush (well, Cheney, actually, but that's another story) launched the Glorious War on Terrorism, he doomed the US to decades of a quagmire war that once begun, could not simply be walked away from. Obama had no choice but to ride the bucking bronco Bush released. Trump has ALSO bombed many countries (and for precisely the same reason Obama did, he had no choice), and the GWOT continues in several places around the world. And it *will* continue for years to come, because it was a bad, BAD idea from the start.

>Trump is considering bad for not allowing illegal immigrant to enter states .

That is SO misleading we can just safely treat is as wrong. Illegal immigration had been declining sharply over the last 20-ish years, mainly due to improving economic conditions south of the border. When Trump came into office, it was at an historical low.

However, in order to win, the Brit mindfuck company [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/in11pc/can_anyone_explain_to_me_why_corporations/g44t0an/) positioned Trump to appeal to the hate and racism of white nationalists, and created the whole border wall concept, because they had previously found that talk of a physical wall at the border made the tiny little dicks of white nationalists get hard. So they got Trump chanting ""build the wall!"" and that got white nationalists to vote for him. A wall, even if you *could* build it--and make no mistake, you cannot--will do very little to combat illegal immigration or halt drugs, because MOST of both of those come into the country through legal ports of entry. Many illegal immigrants FLY into the country on commercial airlines, a wall is not gonna stop them.

Illegal immigration has been an issue for well over a century, and we have usually not handled it very well. But sometimes we have handled it WAY worse than other times, and Trump's racist, white nationalist-based thuggery will NOT go down in history as one our finest hours. Trump has seriously disgraced the nation with his ignorance and hate."
3800,2020-09-06 03:11:47,inep4d,"Trump is considered bad because he lies indiscriminately and defends child molesters and white supremacists.  No one is saying Obama was perfect, but compared to Trump he’s Mother freaking Theresa."
3801,2020-09-06 03:11:09,inep4d,"Yup, welcome to US politics where its only ok to drone strike carpet bomb countries if it's ""my party.""

Fair warning, your post is probably gonna get removed because mods on Reddit are biased anti-Trump cunts. I don't even like Trump that much but fuck does everyone love to hate him..."
3802,2020-09-06 03:19:49,inep4d,"Social media makes you think everyone is liberal or progressive when that's not the case.

Obama disallowed way more immigrants from entering than Trump ever has, bombed several nations, and started the practice of putting immigrant kids in cages. But social media is decidedly left-wing, and everyone has been made to believe that Obama=good and Trump=evil. I don't like Trump that much, and it's easy to criticize his horrible speaking skills and questionable decisions, but social media blows it way out of proportion."

I would suggest Obama put the job before his ego and trump put himself/ego before anything else"
3804,2020-09-06 03:13:33,inep4d,You think that's the only reason people don't like Trump?
3805,2020-09-06 03:29:22,inep4d,Most people weren't as politically active when Obama was in office. He was charismatic and a well spoken individual and that's all the public saw for the most part. No one really paid any attention to what he did. Trump looks bad because he's a polarizing figure and has had the spotlight on him every day since he ran for president. People who don't know a single piece of legislation passed by Obama or even Bush are now citing everything Trump does without a reference point.
3806,2020-09-06 03:29:08,inep4d,"Honestly, I think Obama did some pretty bad shit.  But he was polished and genteel about it.  Trump is crass and so he’s bashed by everyone... but to say Trump defends white supremecists and child molesters shows that you’re swallowing a little too much of what the elitists are feeding America."

And--oh yeah by the way--if the previous president had forced the country into an unwinnable quagmire that Obama could not simply walk away from. Trump has also kept up the slaughter, and for precisely the same reason Obama did: Bush left us no feasible choice. The next *several* presidents will still be fighting the Glorious War on Terrorism."
3810,2020-09-06 03:30:41,inep4d,I’m am saying that based solely on things that have come directly out of Trumps mouth.

Lying is literally immoral."

He’s been handed the highest honor / responsibility this country has to offer and to say that his lying doesn’t matter and isn’t immoral is a complete disregard for what his office is supposed to be. 

Lying to the public is “extremely” important. Not for Bob down at your local gas station but for the highest position in the country? Yes. Yes, it is."

Honestly that one of the first things I realized that the media were not actually giving it to us straight in trump.  He literally says “now I’m not talking about the white supremecists.  They should be condemned completely” he says that like two sentences before they quote him.  

And honestly I do think that Trump can be an idiot.  And obviously lies.  But if you think that the Obama administration was honest or was in any way “mother fucking Theresa” then your not seeing things clearly."

I'm curious to people in here, if things go well in November, what possible positions in the Biden administration would you most hope for? What would you most expect?

I think UN ambassador would be a great fit for Pete."

3838,2020-09-07 02:05:44,inehg3,"Something to mention is that even if Pete doesn't get a position in the cabinet, being on the advisory board will give him a chance to get close and personal with a lot of the powerful people that are in the cabinet (through--and including--interactions with people on the advisory board).

This is a sign that Pete is on track to cement himself as a household name in the Democratic party for years to come."

3842,2020-09-06 16:26:36,inehg3,"I think he would be a phenomenal Chief of Staff, but that it's not a great career-builder for him (it's the best position among ""the help"", but it's not a principal role). More likely, UN Ambassador would be a good fit for his experience level, and would give him more foreign policy credibility. He's still going to need to find his way to an elected office somewhere though, unfortunately."

Watch any speech Biden gave before 2008, he'll say it outright. Obama's brand has always been a progressive. He's not actually very progressive and his response to the 2008 crisis was fairly conservative, but that's his brand. Obamacare was Mitt Romney's healthcare plan from the Clinton era.


Biden's healthcare plan is minor tweaks to Obamacare. Yes, it's technically ""more progressive"" than Obama but in the context of the 2020 primary, his plan is more conservative than Bernie, Beto, Castro, Harris, Warren, Williamson, DeBlasio, and Booker. Within the Democratic field, Biden is more conservative than everyone except maybe Bloomberg, Klob, and Delaney. Obama ran as the most progressive candidate in the field.

 - proper Covid procedures 

We have seen how other countries took the advice of doctors and scientists and have a tiny fraction of the deaths that we have. Kushner intentionally suppressed a national strategy because he wanted blue state deaths to get blamed on dem governors for GOP political gains. I assume living people is better for business than dead ones, although Im not sure what Herman Cain's ghost twitter will say

 - no useless trade wars that ""are easy to win"" but have not been won

Chinese trade and manufacturing is a complicated issue, but its clear trump doesnt have the mental capacity to understand it. Farmers are filing more bankruptcies, and committing more suicides. probably bad for business.

Anyway, to answer your question, Democrats take the lead on infrastructure projects that make business easier. Meanwhile, Trump is trying to dismantle the post office, which many small businesses use to conduct business."

But he is making something, and speculating a net of 5% is pretty damn generous. I think it's more likely he's netting somewhere in the 20-something net percentage range off the government due to various reasons, among which include the fact that he'll fleece anyone or any entity he can at every opportunity, and the government is especially vulnerable to being fleeced, particularly when there's zero accountability.

Another side effect is no mass immigration of middle east and sub sahariana people to europe with a far less growth of far right parties and right terrorism (like the utoya shooting) will be unlike to happen because the core battle of them is oppositon to immigration.

So if 9/11 didin't happen i think most American skylines would be taller than what it is now. I Also think China wouldn't be a superpower if 9/11 didin't happen."

Say, for example, that the US claims Saddam was suppressing pro-democracy voices within Iraq; or Saddam continues to not co-operate with weapons inspections; or Saddam funds some terrorist group in a neighboring country. Even if an excuse wasn't found, killing/removing Saddam was still a goal for the US. Assassination attempts could make Saddam more paranoid, making him do *something* that pisses off the US."

The application would be challenging though because the current format promotes all that is bad."
4096,2020-10-10 07:23:53,j8equk,"I agree, it seems like the decline is consistent, however, it would be simplistic to just blame modern technology (or at least technology from the last decades). Culture influences the importance of people qualities, so you just need to take a look at the cultural references that media pushes. it's fair that the current trends aren't about reading books, writing poems, as times change, however I think it's a disgrace that kids only want to create dumb videos for TikTok, youtube and so.

Also, maybe we should consider other variables, like age of the presidential candidates. I'm sure both candidates were sharper back in the days. However, I think this might not be as important as their younger aides and advisers don't seem sharper either."

My theory is that Trump is being used as an example by the elite not to deviate from standard politicians. The sentiment of “draining the swamp” aka mass uprising against the political elite was bound to occur. Now, people will be afraid to challenge the status quo and the media will use trump as a tool to remind the public never to deviate from standard rule. I also think it was a way to politicize racism and further division within the two party system. If everyone is so occupied fighting across the isle, they aren’t looking at who’s pulling the strings behind the scenes."

4101,2020-10-10 06:10:28,j8equk,"Something I think about quite often, how does power corrupt in the first place? I always liked the line between conspiracy and debates into human nature. Abstractly, politics is just that, what is the best way for people to govern? How does a nation exist in a perpetual state? 

In reality politics is about, how do I join club x? You can see it in the fake laughs/smiles politicians have, you see it in what the laws actually state rather than what the congressmen sponsoring the law says. They all want a foot in the door, because to them that means overcoming another obstacle, that is how corruption happens. This is the core difference between someone overusing technology to the point that they are so detached from reality that actual social interaction is so difficult. You want to talk about the *evolution of language*? Dude, how old are memes? They are a self-contained dialect. If this evolution is calculated then we have no chance, I like to think otherwise (again, free will?). 

No, power is what these people are after, tech is a tool that can be used by us or them. Within the United States, 2012 still felt like a ""recession recovery"" and everyone was rigidly on the lookout for any disruptions in the market (a generational thing, maybe). Truth is that they are using human nature against us, gas-lighting,  tech, power, money, status, these are things that pull on our nature that expose us to their methods of manipulation.

An example I encountered was the assertion that FEMA had acquired 30,000 guillotines and would be using them to execute some large number of Americans unspecified. I wanted to know where these were stored as they would take up a huge amount of space I wanted to know where they were acquired. I also made the point that one Guillotine alone could kill thousands of people. Especially if accompanied by readily available automation. I made a wild guess that 30,000 was far more than were needed for any sort of such plan. This back of the napkin reasoning can help to diffuse the immediate anxiety long enough to inquire as to how the person came across the information and why he trusted the source. You can sometimes enable the person to question the validity of that particular outlet in the future. After that you can work on why the person felt a need to hear out such macabre scenarios. This is where things get tricky. Trust is breaking down. But it doesn't mean that FEMA is staffed by hostile people. If you know somebody who works in FEMA you can talk about that. This is a matter of practical cognitive therapy as I understand it. Once the individual knows the truth or can grasp that other outcomes are more likely he can calm himself down to listen to more specific types of reasoning."

4143,2020-10-11 21:59:00,j87i5j,"Thanks for the effortpost Ralph! Some brief thoughts on your questions:

>why was he not a Trump voter in 2016?

As you note, I believe Harris was quite transparent that he thought Trump was more honest about the threat of Islamic extremism than Clinton was. The obvious conclusion is that he felt  there were other, more pressing concerns about Trump that outweighed his concerns about Clinton in this area. Based on his subsequent comments about Trump, I'd suggest that his strong stance on the harm caused by lying probably plays a strong role here.

(To be clear: I'm not suggesting Hillary Clinton never lies, but rather that Trump's relationship to the truth presents even more profound problems than those presented by run-of-the-mill political spin/denial/etc.)

>Did Sam Harris contribute to the anti-Muslim sentiments in American society that helped Donald Trump become elected?

I don't think there's any way to answer this as-asked except to say ""yes,"" but I also don't know that it's particularly meaningful. As a rough analogy, if you asked if apples contributed to the obesity problem in the US, the answer there is also clearly ""yes,"" even if apples aren't unique in their contributions or even a notably significant part of the overall cause.

I think you mean to ask something more like whether or not Harris played a *large* role in these sentiments or whether or not he is *morally culpable* in some way. To the former, I'd say ""probably not."" There is clearly a contingent of his fans who engage in all sorts of hideous behavior and take Harris' position on these issues as license to pat themselves on the back as 'rational' and 'civilized.' (They usually log on to this sub with lovely names like 'MuslimsAreTerries.') But by virtue of his limited reach alone I would suggest that trying to answer this in the affirmative is a bit like pinning a hurricane on the back of an individual butterfly.

To the latter... I don't honestly know. The ethical issue of how to present oneself honestly in public while also taking care for the likely ramifications of your statements (including likely misinterpretations!) is, I think, incredibly complex. One is reminded, here, of Dave Chappelle having to come to terms with the fact that his [biting satire of racism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLOw_SzkRQ8) was leading real people in the real world to shout the n-word or other derogatory statements at him (""jokingly"") in public places. Was he culpable for spreading racism, even though he was intending to undermine it? I don't think there's an easy answer to that question. In Sam's case, I think trying to assess how often his statements fall about Islam/Muslims fall into each of the following categories:

1. Honest/largely accurate statements that any of us would expect to be interpreted as signals of support for religious and ethnic tolerance. (e.g. ""We’re not against Muslim immigration. In fact both of us count among our friends Muslims and former Muslims, who are precisely the sorts of people we are most concerned to protect."")
2. Honest/largely accurate statements that any reasonable observer would expect to further Islamophobic views/attitudes in many listeners. (e.g. ""there is a direct link between the doctrine of Islam and Muslim terrorism"")
3. Statements which.... well, I won't call them 'deceptive,' as I don't think it's helpful to presume bad faith on Harris' part, but which are, at a minimum, *misleading* and which could only ever be expected to increase anti-Muslim sentiment. (e.g. ""What freedom wouldn’t you be willing to forfeit, if you’re willing to  let your daughters, and your neighbor’s daughters, by the thousands, get  gang raped for years?"")

How we'd want to assess Harris' ethical responsibility on the whole, I think, depends on the balance between these three. My sense is that instances of '3' are clearly wrong, but I would also argue that they represent a minority of cases for Harris (and to the extent that he does engage in this, it usually has to do with blurring the lines between 'Islam' as a global religion often practiced under theocracies, and 'Muslims' in America/Europe, as in the selected quote above). I agree with Harris that it's actually unethical to completely shy away from the 'uncomfortable truths' in '2,' but I think the ethical question here hinges an awful lot on how much those statements are balanced against the sort of 'virtue signalling' in '1.' I know folks on the internet these days think virtue signalling is empty performance, but it's a key part of communicating *meaning* to an audience as well -- consider the difference between the significance of a sentence like 'African Americans have the unemployment rate of any ethnic group' when it's said at a Klan rally vs. at a meeting of the local branch of the NAACP -- and a speaker/writer has some ethical obligation to be aware of that.

It's here that I might criticize Sam's handling of those 'uncomfortable truths.' He does sometimes preface or couch them in precisely these sorts of calls for tolerance, but these sorts of statements regularly come across from him as perfunctory or ancillary to his real concerns. If he were asking my advice (ethical or otherwise), I would push him to say them more frequently and more often. I understand his frustration at having to repeat himself, and I understand his anger at people who assume if he *doesn't* make the right noises, people will assume him to be a bigot. Nonetheless, that is the reality of human communication, particularly in a highly polarized environment. Communicative acts can *only* have meaning in embodied communities: if 99% of the people who drop ""Sharia law"" into a conversation think all Muslims should be deported, you need to know that when you say those words your audience will default to assuming you support that position, and assign whatever respect/admiration they have for you as a speaker/thinker to the presumed intent.

See also: yes, I know the swastika is an ancient symbol found across many indigenous cultures, but if you're carrying a swastika flag in Charlottesville in the 21st century, don't be surprised if a lot of people assume you're a Nazi -- or, conversely, if you were wearing one on your arm in 1970s London, you shouldn't have been surprised if people presumed precisely the opposite (that you were an antifascist punk rocker looking to beat up Nazis), because, as with anything else, ""[what this sign means will ultimately depend... less on the intrinsic cultural symbolism of the thing in itself, and more on the balance of forces](https://www.hf.uio.no/ikos/english/research/news-and-events/events/phd/2019/hall_notes-on-deconstructing--the-popular-.pdf)"" between real people and communities in the real world."

>In essence, Harris is saying that yes, he thinks that ‘we’ are at war  with Muslims in general, to the extent that they consider themselves  devout or practicing Muslims

This is absolutely a false assessment for example. Harris articulates it many times that only the Islamists that take the parts literally conflicting with our worldview and act on it. He always describes it as being at war with Islam, a set of ideas, not being at war with Muslims. He explains it very well in the funny Bill Maher segment with Ben Affleck.

In fact he described it so many times that we need to reform Islam and embrace refugees and moderate Muslims that the fact that you're trying to conflate this with Trump's moronic fearmongering is astounding to me. 

Not to mention Trump's obvious buffoonery and bullshitting about the subject. I guarantee you that if you gave Trump a questionnaire with elementary questions about the history and nature of Islam he'd fail every single one of them. He doesn't understand anything of what he's talking about. He oversimplifies and exaggerates the subject, omits any kind detail and nuance and spits out repetitive fearmongering platitudes and meaningless statements, as he usually does, to rile up the hateful idiots of the country. You can easily tell this by his meaningless political stunts he did like the travel ban from a couple Islamic countries.

Has everyone who has been critical of Islam or spoken out about issues within Islam explicitly said that: 'we' are 'at war' with more than just jihadists (and this war is one involving bloodshed); Islam is completely 'fringe'; that the Quran or Muslim belief fully explains things like suicide bombing; that moderate Muslims have to tolerate, advocate, and practice ethnic profiling; that 'we' could be witnessing the destruction and suicide of Europe due to the presence of Muslims; that Muslims in France could lead to a civil war in which 1 million people die; that people are 'prepared to be raped' by Muslim immigrants; that a Muslim community center built near to a site of a major terrorist attack would be wrong on some level; that Donald Trump is right when he speaks of Western civilization potentially being destroyed? Because I'm extremely skeptical about that.

In fact I know it's simply a case of you not reading widely enough, because all I have to do is point to the writing of Ali Eteraz, who wrote a multiple-article series on reforming Islam in which he was critical of prominent strains or tendencies within Islam, and yet didn't engage in fear-mongering, endorsing anti-Muslim conspiracy theories, making inflammatory statements about Muslims raping people, saying he explicitly agreed with the message of someone like Trump about the West being destroyed etc.:

4162,2020-10-11 21:13:15,j87i5j,"It's not impossible to criticise Islam without hitting buttons, particularly from some birds-eye historical analysis that results in little more than 'extremists bad', or some literary '*in this passage is Mohammed right, or is he right but in a slightly different way?*' 'internal critique', or in something like Eteraz's softer introspection of ’so I corrected him by saying that the Hadith *actually* said that concubines were subhuman, and all was fine’. (Aside from a few small strange parts this is a fantastic article series, and consider that it aligns very closely with Harris arguments, about problems in the Islamic world, the need for a Muslim 'left' etc - aside from the comment on Enlightnment having already happened).


But go deeper and you find the outer limits of being able to make controversy-less claims about Muslim's, as believers, becomes a little more difficult. Eteraz believes some percentage of Muslim's hold and encourage bad beliefs about women, minorities, foreigners etc. Logically he thinks, when hundreds of thousands of war-displaced migrants enter Europe, some part of that, in some percentage of them, follows, right? That's not to say you can't voice that point without controversy, but how different is that to what someone like Harris argues? How close would that match Trumps 'rhetoric'?


This is even with something like Harris' shittily worded comment on leftist woman being hypocritically silent on sexual assault from Muslim migrants? Even with 'suicide' in the sense of Europe's identity (and lack thereof), in the face of Western apathy/resignation, being bound to change by such large numbers from cultures *with* strong identities/cultures (ie. not 'suicide' as in 'the brown people are coming' which I'm more than certain how its meant to sound in your list).


---


What I see in this comparison is nearly everything you compare here between Harris and Trump not even communicating the same thing, some of it you haven't even bothered finding an analogous quote other than some broad 'Europe' comment from Trump, as if simply criticising that crisis is bad enough (they both use 'pouring'!). And nearly all wilfully exploiting the inescapable crawlspace between 'Muslim' as both the ethnic group and correct term for 'followers of Islam', as if just using the word 'Muslim' is enough to stretch to encompass all, rather that who the part it's very obviously directed at.  
Trump concurs with something close to 'we are at war with Muslim's', and Harris specifically says 'we are not at war with all Muslim's'? And that's unimportant? Consider that Eteraz would, again, probably concur with Trump and Harris on this broader view of Islam's flaws. They're all identical comments because someone rightly identifies the Islamic world as the origin of nearly all suicidal terrorism in the 21st century?


This is, as several other replies noted, all *despite knowing* how Harris views the percentage of Muslim's concentric circles of reception to things like Jihad in the modern world. 'The vast majority are peaceful, modern people'. 'Even if that's just 1%...'. Etc etc. Criticisms like this seem more interested in criticising a version of Harris' argument they *know* (in quotes that are always selectively excluded) not to be complete.


I'm not convinced by this slightly reworded 'greatest hits' of what you deem unsavoury Harris comments/arguments, presented as a pretty futile comparison. Not to mention your increasingly bloviated and exaggeratedly portrayed list in your reply.


---


If, irrespective of all the above, your question is '*Why didn't Harris, in light of his Carson comment about terrorism policy, vote for Trump?*' the answer probably is because believing certain things about the dangers of Islam/Islamism etc is different to believing someone making criticisms of the same thing is always rational, smart or ethical enough to separating their proposals/actions from bigotry towards Muslim’s as people. Something Harris makes clear consistently, and something that seems *forever irrelevant* as a valid point of distinction to certain people, based off some miniscule, selective list of comments they believe forever counters everything he's said otherwise.


Harris doesn’t know what motivates Trump other than his own interests, believes he has no qualifications or experience whatsoever, and probably doesn’t trust whatever version of ‘we’ll destroy ISIS’ Trump has promised. *And*, on top of everything, he was probably exaggerating in his Chomsky/Carson comment that he was voting solely based on terrorism policy."

It’s not.  The real reason pelosi and Schumer don’t do shit isn’t incompetence.  They are very competent.

.

The real reason is that neo-liberals also benefit from many of the same policies the gop puts forth. Ie: they are in the same tax bracket and they got the same donors. 

. 

Pelosi ain’t gonna fight trump’s corporatist SCOTUS because pelosi is funded by corporations and also is in a tax bracket that benefits from that nomination. 

.

So it’s shit like that..... Kyle seems like a great guy and I’m very grateful for his work.  But he’s not talking about the real reasons shit goes down the way it does.  No Kyle.... establishment dems aren’t week.  That’s part of the con.

I'm all for holding Obama responsible for his use of them and misuse of them but I hear many on the right being critical of drone strikes without being critical of the actions of his predecessor, who started the wars where they were used and the program itself. How do you kill terrorists without putting more American lives at stake? I understand Bush didn't get a Nobel Peace Prize and Obama did but I'm curious why one form of violence is acceptable to some and the other not. Way too many civilians died in both cases."

But sometimes war is still necessary, and as war goes drone strikes are fairly targeted. It seems at least plausible that it was good policy. And in any case, it is certainly not true that the majority of those killed were civilians.

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualties_from_U.S._drone_strikes)
>According to the Long War Journal, which follows US anti-terror developments, as of mid-2011, drone strikes in Pakistan since 2006 had killed 2,018 militants and 138 civilians.[15] The New America Foundation stated in mid-2011 that from 2004 to 2011, 80% of the 2,551 people killed in the strikes were militants. The Foundation stated that 95% of those killed in 2010 were militants and that, as of 2012, 15% of the total people killed by drone strikes were either known civilians or unknown.[16] The Foundation also states that in 2012 the rate of known civilian and unknown casualties was 2 percent, whereas the Bureau of Investigative Journalism say the rate of civilian casualties for 2012 is 9 percent.[17] The Bureau, based on extensive research in mid-2011, claims that at least 385 civilians were among the dead, including more than 160 children.[18]"

It's almost always a shitshow, and even though I loved what obama said when he started his presidency his actions were pretty much the same doctrine that the Bush adminstration had. 

It blows my mind when people keep reposting pictures of him as if it was some golden age."
4278,2020-10-09 19:24:53,j81zd0,"Are you saying someone shouldn’t receive a Nobel peace prize just for being black while being elected? 

It’s astounding to me that we’re still pretending that he wasn’t handed the award for being the first black president.  

And apparently I’m a racist for pointing this out, I just thought the award was supposed to be about the actions of the recipient."

4281,2020-10-09 17:47:57,j81zd0,It was a bullshit prize. He later authorized more drone bombing.
4282,2020-10-09 19:27:30,j81zd0,It was an award for being the first black president.  Normally recipients have to actually do something but not in this case.

4287,2020-10-09 16:40:21,j81zd0,">Obama has as President created a new climate in international politics. Multilateral diplomacy has regained a central position, with emphasis on the role that the United Nations and other international institutions can play. Dialogue and negotiations are preferred as instruments for resolving even the most difficult international conflicts. The vision of a world free from nuclear arms has powerfully stimulated disarmament and arms control negotiations. Thanks to Obama’s initiative, the USA is now playing a more constructive role in meeting the great climatic challenges the world is confronting. Democracy and human rights are to be strengthened.

>Only very rarely has a person to the same extent as Obama captured the world’s attention and given its people hope for a better future. His diplomacy is founded in the concept that those who are to lead the world must do so on the basis of values and attitudes that are shared by the majority of the world’s population.

4294,2020-10-09 23:48:15,j81zd0,"Fuck Trump.

But giving a peace prize to Obama was horrible considering he did nothing to earn it.

911 was 19 years ago. Trump has only been in office for 4 years.

US national debt when 911 started was around $6 trillion. It's currently just gone over $27 trillion debt. The US has been at war in like 6 different countries since and most Americans couldn't name them.

[Propaganda was made legal under Obama.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/07/14/u-s-repeals-propaganda-ban-spreads-government-made-news-to-americans/)

It was under Obama that congress gave funding to fight against Assad in Syria. Those guys turned into ISIS. It was also under Obama that Clinton had Gaddafi killed in Libya which [revived the slave trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Libya).

He ran under the claim of being anti-war. Bullshit. He just moved troops around and used more drones.

US media is corpomilitary. The US military teamed up with the corporate media owners to control the media industry back in the 80s as a way to insure there was no anti-war movement against them.

Bush got away with potential war crimes and 8 years of war by acting like a bumbling idiot. The war machine got away with another 8 years of war by putting a charming black guy in office and telling everyone they were progressive. Didn't really do much though did it?

With Trump, the media frames him as a crazy lunatic on purpose. They crank up the dial so while everyone has been falling for whatever crap he says, the war machine has gotten another 4 years of war.

Trump wasn't put in by Russia, he's probably CIA/Hollywood. He's a provocateur. A heel. Fake wrestler. His job is to piss people off and it works great."

They'd hit a target they believed to be legit (which is itself pretty sketchy and something most countries couldn't get away with).

Then the drone would linger and drop *another bomb* on the people who came to render first aid to the primary target. That is getting pretty far over the war crimes line.

The country was in rough shape when he came in. Two long-term, high-cost wars with little public satisfaction with the results, a ruined economy, high unemployment, and a lot of lost housing and retirement.

It took a year to get the economy moving again (finish crashing, really), but then there was a record number of growth months in a row (128) which only ended this year. Things were literally looking up while Obama slowly began withdrawing troops from the Middle East, something a majority of Americans had wanted for a while.

Apparently, the president was among the 61 percent of Americans who believed he didn’t deserve it.

“It is true, Obama did not do much before winning,” Lundestad, 74, a member of Norway’s Nobel Committee until 2014, told The Post. “But he represented the ideals of the committee. And when we have an American president who supports that message, we like to strengthen him.”"

That assassination provoked the calculated response of Iran bombarding an unoccupied area of a US military base.

Trump on the other hand has already [exceeded Obama's numbers on drone strikes](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-has-expanded-obamas-drone-war-to-shadow-war-zones-2018-11). He also has raised world tensions between US and China and Russia. He has also destabilized our alliances with European nations who no longer trust us to protect them. He also turned his back on our Kurdish allies and allowed them to be steamrolled by Turkish forces.

While Obama put on a much better impression internationally, he proved through his actions (such as drone program expansions) not to be the harbinger of peace he appeared to be. Obama inherited lots of trouble from Bush and Cheney, but I think his legacy should be ""He could have done better"".

It’s absolutely fucking ridiculous to narrow in on the President for doing exactly what he and his predecessors were elected to do, when there’s a representative congress that has not bothered to exercise its war authorisation powers.

You are given a set of options as a President, ranging from full invasion/occupancy to just getting the f\*\*\* outta Dodge. People around him are telling him that the best way to keep US citizens and soldiers safe is through these drone strikes, and he went with it, probably because it seems like a good middle path. It's easy to see how a person surrounded by people he respects and they are all telling him one story, he'd go with it.

4434,2020-10-09 14:30:43,j7zzc9,"Hello, America! I am the housefly that perched atop Mike Pence’s head for [two solid minutes](https://twitter.com/bubbaprog/status/1314029118279897089) during Wednesday night’s vice presidential debate, and I’d like to talk to you about the future of this great nation. Like some of you, I was undecided when I began watching the debate, because, as with some of you, my brain is the size of a poppyseed. But when I heard Mike Pence outline the Trump administration’s plans, I knew there was only one ticket I could trust to protect me and the 150 or so eggs I laid in the vice president’s hair. Today I am thrilled to wholeheartedly endorse Donald J. Trump for president.

You may be confused as to why I am offering an endorsement in the first place, since most Americans share molecular physicist Seth Brundle’s pernicious misconception that “[insects don’t have politics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW_08LCWp34).” It’s true that we’re not big on compromise, but it’s also true that we love garbage, and we love corpses, and we love shit, and you don’t have to have one of those big ugly mammalian brains to tell which political party is committed to materially improving our lives. No president in my life cycle—which began two weeks ago, when I was a maggot happily gnawing my way through a rotten Egg McMuffin in a dumpster behind Kingsbury Hall—has done more to roll back environmental regulations, ensuring that my family and I have a constant supply of garbage where we can live, laugh, and love. No president in my life cycle has provided more dead Americans for us to eat, working tirelessly to overwhelm hospitals and morgues, presumably for our benefit. And no administration in history, never mind my life cycle, has been as dedicated to shit in all its forms—bullshit, horseshit, and of course the literal shit that inevitably accompanies a diet of fast food and Diet Coke—pumping it into the airwaves, the sewers, and the skulls of their supporters. There’s just no question which administration will do more to help me feed my family.

This election goes beyond mere material concerns, however; there’s also a spiritual dimension. And for faith-based voters like me, the Trump administration is the only option. Like all flies, I worship Beelzebub, the Lord of the Flies, the Prince of Demons, the Archfiend of Lies and Death and Decay, and my faith is very important to me. When I heard Mike Pence speak so movingly of *his* faith—his faith in Donald Trump, primarily—I knew which administration I could trust to build Our Dark Lord’s Throne of Lies right here on earth. Kamala Harris did her best to dissemble at a few points, and maybe it worked on television, but take it from a fly in the studio audience: You could *smell* the evil radiating from Mike Pence. In fact, I was originally only planning on briefly alighting on the vice president’s head, running my ovipositor through his gorgeous strands of snowy white hair, dropping a clutch of eggs, and going on my merry way. But the second the setae on my footpads touched that wiry surface, I sensed a kindred intelligence coldly whirring and clicking away just under Pence’s skull, and I knew it was time for me to make my first political endorsement.

My endorsement of a Republican candidate may be surprising to those who remember my great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandmother’s endorsement of Hillary Clinton back in 2016, which famously caused Alex Jones to speculate that Clinton and Barack Obama [were both demons](https://www.gq.com/story/barack-obama-alex-jones-demon-evidence).

The explanation here is simple, and it’s a treasured story my family has passed down to our larvae for 48 generations: We were pranking Alex Jones because he sucks. Land in the right place at the right time, and you can get that dude to believe pretty much anything. I know that humans are bad at detecting a wryly cocked proboscis, but you hardly needed compound eyes to see that Hillary Clinton was just a run-of-the-mill Democrat, not some kind of hellbeast of decay practically rubbing her hands together with glee at the thought of stacking the lies and the garbage and the bodies so high that mankind’s rotten civilization finally collapses and the Age of the Fly can begin.

The 2020 election is different, however. I have listened closely to Mike Pence’s plans and policies. I have carefully smelled his hair. I have laid hundreds of eggs in his scalp. And this November, I am confident that there is only one ticket that can ensure a happy, healthy, and extremely well-fed future for my larvae. I urge all humans to cast your votes for Donald Trump and Michael Pence. They might not literally be insects, but they’re the closest thing we’ve got. Besides, the other guy is trying to kill [me](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1314031047013732352/photo/1)."

R1: Modern weaponry like a handgun would most likely impress the common French people, much less someone of importance. To ensure I don’t run out I figure I can bring a sort of small ammo box to carry with me. If multiple objects aren’t allowed for one round I could bring a gun with an exceptionally long pool of ammo already included.

R2: Stalin would probably be the hardest to convince as something like a gun wouldn’t be impressive to him, however a phone playing a video of anything high quality, perhaps that video of [modern day Russians marching to the song from Red Alert 3](https://youtu.be/iMyuZxYjiXw) would do it in for him. The video could be downloaded onto the phone of course. 

R3: Conversely, Obama would probably be the easiest to convince, as he’s the most reasonable of the people on this list. An executive order signed by him with his finger prints on it should be enough. 

R4: A stick that could produce fire just from the push of a button would most likely impress the tribe, a bic lighter also works."

This post has less than 100 upvotes. The US is a nation of over 330 million. This specific forum has been written off as just a bunch of *nutters* and *conspiracy theorists* who believe in *flat earth* and *Q Anon*. They currently don’t have to control *everything on the internet*, just discredit outright by connecting it to other *crazy talk* and it discredits itself. Who actually sees this? Maybe over a hundred people? 

The Pentagon over the last four years released that UFOs are real and that they have hangers on the West coast housing fragments from these unexplained flying objects. Who in a nation of over 330 million was up in arms and freaking out about it? It was taken as blase and everyone kept on doing whatever they always were doing. 

What can you or I really do with this knowledge? This isn’t the 1700s where we can *storm the Bastille*. 

Unlike China which seems to imprison even a mere peasant who dares utter a word against Xi and the Party, TPTB have rendered much of the US populace apathetic and stuck in a manufactured game of Republican vs Democrat designed to divide them. 

But it’s not like TPTB aren’t trying to *tighten the noose* around what is and isn’t acceptable discourse online and through social media. We are seeing that through YouTube demonetizing channels with alternative viewpoints outside the mainstream and with Facebook banning any talk and profile pages which even hint at Q Anon. AG Barr and FBI Director Wray are pushing for backdoors in all encryption services via a bill in Congress. They are *slowly* tightening the noose or bringing the water to a boil as to not alert most people who are still asleep.

You don’t think that the CIA has blackmail on CEOs and shareholders and business executives? The real owners are who controls the banking and financial infrastructure not only in the US but worldwide with the IMF and World Bank and other entities.

'Unless Bill Barr indicts these people for crimes, the greatest political crime in the history of our country, then we're going to get little satisfaction unless I win and we'll just have to go, because I won't forget it,' Trump said.

'But these people should be indicted, this was the greatest political crime in the history of our country and that includes Obama and it includes Biden. These are people that spied on my campaign and we have everything,' Trump said.

He was referencing U.S. Attorney John Durham's probe of alleged FBI misconduct during the Russia probe, instigated by Barr's appointment of Durham, a career prosecutor."

So Putin swept in to put the useful idiot in power. Who does Trump owe half a billion dollars to? Why did he take a meeting with Putin and wouldn’t allow anyone else in the room? Why did Jr and Jarrod take a meeting with Putin’s friend because they had dirt on Clinton? Why did Trump buy a mansion for 4 mil and turn around and sell it to a Russian for 54 mil?

This is about real *power* to control finances(can ruin your business), public perception(MSM, blackmail) or physical(Terrorism and Assassination).

Think of the US government as a syndicate with old money mafia clans at the core with associated New Money/power factions.

Just look what happened to members of the Kennedy family, a Mafia family itself. They apparently overplayed their cards as President and ex. States Attorney General while being Senator. 

These factions have access to state secrets and I would not be surprised the slightest some even have weapons of mass destruction, as ultimate personal protection including legal prosecution.

But you can't really do that while everyone is harbouring personal agendas, vendettas and their lust for power or the end of freedom, while pretending to want what's best.

One of my American friends has told me about a major farming case that involved prejudice. In that case prejudice was proven, and the victims, who were African American, were paid out. In this case, the system, which was non-racist (systemic-fairness), dealt justly and took down the prejudice. So yes racism can still affect people, but it isn't systemic in my view.

The problem with analogies is that while they can provide useful insight, not all aspects of them are always applicable. The assumption behind the analogy is that <some minority> is the one running with the weight - an assumption that is not always true and not in every case. Some people decide to run further and some people prefer to sit on the grass. And some people decide to put 500 lbs of weight in their own back back when they decide to do things like get involved in the illicit drug trade.

>I should try to be clearer - these issues (and other similar ones) are the systemic racism

This analogy would work, if society was out to constantly punish minorities for being minorities. But it doesn't, on the whole (least, not as far as I can tell). Sure, there are instances where you get one, racist, bad actor who makes things worse by being a piece of shit. But the analogy works better if you phrase it as ""the 100 lbs is on your back from the start, and at the 100 meter mark, you stop and complain to the judge"" or something along those lines. **I'm going to operate under this, as I feel, better analogy for the remainder of my reply.**

This 100 lbs of weight is alluding to the socioeconomic issues holding back many minorities, agreed? Education is now public, so a black student in one state is, essentially, getting the same education as a white student in any other state (or the same state). We've eliminated most of the more-tangible barriers holding back minorities, and the ""last"" (I doubt that) thing holding back minorities are less-tangible things like backgrounds. Things you can't really help. Your IQ. The wealth of the family you're born into. Your values & culture. Current social justice activists have targeted wealth. That's why reparations were a subject of discussion not a year ago.

Unless you still believe that some more-tangible issues need yet be addressed. And so my response is: where? Please point out where, in our federal law, systemic racism still exists.

Because in my eyes, most of the issues plaguing minority communities aren't as much a result of racism as they are due to relative wealth disparities and overcrowding. Essentially: cities."

Color me dubious.
2.

You are more likely to be busted copping in the ghetto because it is more heavily policed than if you were to score from a suburban white boy.  I refer you to the current debate over ""defunding the police.""  Does the south side of Chicago, for example, need more policing or less?
3. This is the result of unfair tax policies which link school funding to property tax revenue. This is unfair to the poor.

You can see that silent gen got skipped almost entirely, except for joe Biden this year. If he lost, we would never have had a silent president (doubt we would have gotten one in 2024)

The silent generation was just dwarfed by the size and power of the greatest gen and boomers. Nothing wrong with them, but the just sheer size of the other two gens really means they got eclipsed 

I thibk that’s really likely for X, excluding those late boomers who are honorary Xers. Comparatively, there’s just so few of them, and boomers and millennials tend to dominate everything

The logic is that there are so many boomers, and they maintain power for so long. By the time they start letting go, millennials are here. That’s basically what my gen x parents have shared to me about their experiences in the working world. A lot of baby boomers bosses for a long time, followed by millennials starting to rise up.

Idk just food for thought 

If joe Biden wins 2024, I think a millennial president in 2028 is very likely. If he loses or chooses not to run, I think we could still see a boomer, but a gen x or y president is possible."

They are huge. In 2019, when baby boomers were 55-73, they were still the second biggest generation. That’s AFTER their peak, and after they’ve had decades to die off. Poor Gen X is tiny compared to them lol. (Of course it’s not as impressive now because millennials are even larger, but at the time, baby boomers were uniquely large)

Gen X just got stuck in the middle. It was a combo of low birth rates and small parent population. Millennial birth rates raised for a few years (general trend was still down) but there were also a lot of boomers to have a lot of kids. Hence the baby bust in the middle lol.

(We’re probably never going to have as big of a generation again. Gen Z is already smaller than Y and boomers lol)"

Throughout my Middle School and High School Years the hallways were massively packed. although I knew, my way around the school, when it came to special events like Pep Rally the seats were overcrowded and fights would happen."
4637,2020-11-10 01:27:32,jr053k,"Lmao i don’t thibk the number of people in yuri school is an accurate representation of the population of everyone in the country born in the late 90s through early 2010s...

Gen Z is small lol. There’s like 67 million people born between 97 and 12 in the US. There’s 65 million Xers and 72 million millennials.

Looking at birth rates make it pretty clear. Downward trend. My year, 2004, was about 14 per 1000 ppl.  It was a little under 15 in 1995. 1994 was just over 15. 10 years the other way, it’s about 12 and half.

Yep... :/ the birth rate is decreasing a lot.

Like I said above, there are way more millennials than Gen Z."

4723,2020-11-09 05:17:45,jqr4ip,"Wtf Camille, Rudy Giuliani??"
4724,2020-11-09 04:56:00,jqr4ip,"Good on Carole for donating to Jaime Harrison, he was an incredible candidate and I hope he gets his due!

I can’t imagine a time when Graham wasn’t the slime ball he is, Erika donated a huge chunk of change too but aside from that seems blue through and through, wonder why he was the exception."
4725,2020-11-09 04:52:57,jqr4ip,"I’m just shocked that most of the ones who actually have money have donated so little. I’ve donated more than most of them, and I only make $50,000 a year."
4726,2020-11-09 05:32:10,jqr4ip,I am impressed and unimpressed with these donations - holding both those truths. Thanks for channeling your inner MKE 🧐

4747,2020-11-09 07:53:07,jqr4ip,That’s what struck me too! Ramona donating $500 dollars?! What a cheapskate lmao
4748,2020-11-09 05:23:22,jqr4ip,All I could think about reading her donations was that time she tried to defend Kavanaugh (sp?) regarding the rape allegations. It’s odd to be able to identify with an accused rapist so easily.
4749,2020-11-09 05:43:16,jqr4ip,I think she donated a lot of time.
4750,2020-11-09 07:31:13,jqr4ip,She defended Kavanaigh on tv. This is the least surprising

4752,2020-11-09 05:07:18,jqr4ip,"Back in 2007, Graham was considered a moderate -- he worked on bipartisan immigration reform, for example, and he also voted to confirm a lot of Obama's judges. (For the record, I don't think he was ever a moderate, but that's just what the media perception was)"
4753,2020-11-09 05:04:38,jqr4ip,"I totally agree! So weird to see any donations under $500 given their wealth. In this list, I only included a couple of the total donations they made! In particular, Erika made A LOT more donations than I listed."

4756,2020-11-09 05:22:25,jqr4ip,"Oh yeah, that's totally the case for some of these donations. In fact, some of them were flagged as ""reattribution from Thomas Girardi,"" meaning it was a joint contribution. Also, the breadth and scale of her donations (congressional races across this country, throughout multiple election cycles) definitely suggests someone else was helping her decide where to donate."
4757,2020-11-09 08:10:16,jqr4ip,"I’m not sure actually, I think Erika is a smart cookie. Just because she (weirdly) only gives us one dimensional, I don’t think she actually is."
4758,2020-11-09 09:48:00,jqr4ip,"Funny how she's all about the ""gays"" yet she's donated to GOP candidates..."

4760,2020-11-09 05:02:02,jqr4ip,Oh yeah definitely not trying to defend her donation -- Just trying to contextualize why she might have done so back in 2007! I think he was the only Republican she ever donated to (She's given thousands and thousands to a lot of Democrats -- more so than any other housewife on the list)
4761,2020-11-09 04:53:32,jqr4ip,She's supporting an LBGTQ candidate. 🤣

4768,2020-11-09 03:22:38,jqox96,"You know, if Biden is officially president (which the world does think is official), then with the birth year part of my presidential theory, I might extend Gen Z to 2020, ending on January 20, 2021, as having Biden in office I think will shift more of a new era and generational change than Trump ever had, which is the same with the coming of age part of my presidential theory, with me extending Millennials to 2002, ending on January 20, 2003, as those who came of age before the Biden presidency, in which I think will evoke more of a mood shift or whatever in culture and the US, even expanding the US, than the Trump presidency ever did. Not trying to sound like Strauss and Howe or anything but yeah.

So, since Biden is now president-elect, I think I can now ""officially"" say that Generation Alpha, based solely on the terms of the birth year part of my presidential theory, starts on January 20, 2021.

Just because it has “British” in the name, and he’s got that infuriating American trait of liking to pretend he’s Irish, it has no bearing on the validity of the questions. Not a good sign."

Banning the sale of weapons to countries with terrible records on human rights is also not ""very good for us"", but sometimes you've got to look outside of your own selfish interests and think about what's best for everyone. I don't like Biden at all, but it's better for everyone (us included in the long run) that right wing populism got another kick in the teeth.

All that being said, I don't think Trump would have given us a stellar trade deal either. He would have taken every opportunity available to bend Johnson over the resolute desk."

I'm not Irish, but I have Irish ancestry. The knowledge that my own ancestors were brutalised absolutely makes me instinctively dislike the British Empire, and in particular people like Cromwell.

If anything, it would seem tone-deaf to *not* consider that Obama might not want to lionise the Prime Minister who oversaw his grandfather being put in a concentration camp and tortured.

It's also worth noting that Boris was referring to [comments made by the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2009/mar/04/obama-irish-brown-special), which didn't draw any outrage at the time.

It just seems silly to focus on this, instead of the genuinely highly offensive things Boris has said. The Americans are willing to look past comments about Muslim letterboxes and banana-eating African picanninnies with watermelon smiles, but *this* is what they refuse to accept?"

He has a history of being an IRA sympathizer. That’s not for debate, it’s in the public record. He’s very proud of his “Irish” ness (false) and it bleeds into a lot. 

My take is that it was less a joke than a comment with a veneer of “joking” - he has previous. 

It’s not a mutually exclusive stance to like aspects of a candidate whilst remaining correctly cautious of other parts.

The fact is such comments don’t happen against a neutral background isolated of context. There were _years_ long campaigns to delegitimize Obama’s presidency due to that Kenyan heritage. The comment deliberately fit neatly into those same attacks, albeit in a more polite way.

No. It's not the _EXACT_ argument, nor is it even a particularly _close_ argument.

Let's look at what I wrote:

> But, yes, in general to me if you _assume_ a _particular_ person’s motive for a _particular_ action are based on their heritage that’s racist.

I've emphasized the words _assume_ and _particular_ in that quote. I'll go through each individually:

_assume_: If the body politic made a wild assumption, without ever checking the validity of that assumption, then it might be the same. In the case of pulling down statues we're not _assuming_ a motive. We're listening to people.

Plenty of people are _telling us_ that these statues are offensive / oppressive to people because of their cultural heritage. Here's one example: https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/the-activists-who-took-down-the-confederate-statue-in-durham-still-need-our-help-heres-what-you-can-do/. Here's another: https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/06/19/destroying-confederate-monuments-isnt-erasing-history-its-learning-it/.

So we're not making an _assumption_ about people's motivations. We're listening to people about their stated motivations. Those are very different. Here is a link to another comment where I provide some examples that are consistent with my point about _assumptions_ being critical to the problem of prejudice and racism: https://old.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/jqmvgv/joe_biden_hasnt_forgotten_boris_johnsons_racist/gbp4iv9/

_particular_ person: The debate over pulling down a statue obviously isn't about any particular person being upset about the statue.

_particular_ action: The debate over pulling down statues obviously isn't about a singular action about the group of people."

Recognising that a person will probably have an ill view of someone who tortured their grandfather and subjugated their ancestral homeland isn't ""robbing people of agency"" and it certainly isn't racist. It's a simple acknowledgement of basic human psychology.

If I suggested that the grand-children of gulag victims probably wouldn't take kindly to a Stalin statue, would you accuse me or ""robbing them of agency""?

Pennsylvania is ***not*** having a recount, they haven't even finished their first count. Additionally, they didn't ""forbid observation""—what happened is that they, due to COVID-19 restrictions, had the observers stand 10 feet back. Trump's campaign pitched a fit about that and got a court to rule that they can move up to 6 feet back. That's it.

Different states have different laws, and a margin of less than 1% absolutely does not trigger an automatic recount almost anywhere. There are exactly ***zero*** states with confirmed recounts planned to take place at this point, though Georgia is close enough that it is possible there, pending final results.

Additionally, Trump's campaign is currently 0-10 in their lawsuits they've filed regarding this. They've lost every single one (in fact most were just tossed out as clear nonsense without even digging into them).

I literally said both are a bit racist. What’s hard to understand? It’s the same comment, the same argument, and the same result.

It’s somewhat worse, given the context I described above (the ongoing dishonest and overtly racist campaign against Obama due to his ancestry), but this question was asked and answered already: somewhat racist in both scenarios."

No, because there is a world of difference between saying 'Descendants of Gulag victims don't like Stalin' and, for example 'Everyone of Ukrainian ancestry hates Stalin'.

The former acknowledges the dislike is due to actions against specific individuals connected to the people in question. The latter lumps them all into a unison ethnic block.   

> so now nobody's allowed to mention that he's of Kenyan descent

No one has said this.

>  It's not fucking racist to mention his Kenyan inheritance.

No one said it is.

It is however rascist to imply that his Kenyan inheritance is going to make him act a certain way because he's part Kenyan. Since that implies *all* Kenyans are going to act that way. 

> All that was suggested was that he may well have disliked having a bust of the man who oversaw his grandfather's torture.

Which I agree with. The issue is, as I've said a few times now, the wording used to express that.

Saying 'he dislikes him due to kenyan ancestry' carries the implications that all Kenyans would act that way.

Saying 'he dislikes him due to the torture that happened to his grandfather' doesn't carry the same implications."

Your entire argument for why the suggestion is offensive, hinges on you twisting it into a claim that simply wasn't made.

Talking about the ""ancestral inheritance"" of a part-Kenyan individual is not the same as saying ""every single Kenyan has this view.""

He didn't say ""national,"" ""cultural,"" ""genetic,"" or ""racial"" inheritance. If he had, you'd have a point. He said ""ancestral,"" because he was referring to comments made by the Guardian, concerning a specific ancestor of Obama's.

The wording that you claim makes Boris' comments racist and offensive is lifted *directly from the Guardian*:

>It also sharpens the intriguing question of whether the president's dual colonial **inheritance – of Kenyan and Irish ancestry** – is helping reshape America's supposedly ""special relationship"" with Britain.

>The darker days of the UK's relationship with Kenya may resurface soon when lawyers lodge a class action in the British courts from survivors of the Mau Mau rebellion who claim they were tortured by British soldiers in the 1950s; Obama's grandfather was among those mistreated during the independence struggle.

It’s not about either of them being allowed or not allowed to hold those views. It’s about someone else assuming that they hold those views because of their ancestry, based on no evidence.

Here are some examples:

If I say: “I’m an American and I’m opposed to brexit because of my Scottish heritage” that’s not racist. That’s fine. (I don’t have Scottish heritage to my knowledge, and I’m neutral on Brexit)

If you then say: “He doesn’t support Brexit because of his Scottish heritage” that’s also fine. Still not racist.

But, if I say: “I’m an American and I’m opposed to Brexit”

If you then say: “He doesn’t support Brexit because of his Scottish heritage” that’s a bit racist.

Again, to reiterate, the problem is _making an assumption_ about another person’s motives based on their _race_. That’s a bit racist. That’s the only claim I’ve made.

However even if this alleged software could change that in transit, surely the tally not matching the sent data when it's reported on the internet/TV would prompt the sender to contact.

Also you would have to imagine that the states have a way of backing up the orignally cast ballots.

In my state you get a blank ballot with QR barcode, you feed it to the machine, you touch screen your choices, it prints your choices onto the ballot so you can verify... And then you feed your ballot back into the machine and it's never to be seen by you again. I figured I'd at least get a copy of the QR but nope, nothing.

I'm surprised (in your abundant fairness) that you didn't give [the entire story:](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/08/senate-record-breaking-gridlocktrump-303811)

>George W. Bush faced the most procedural hurdles and filibusters to his nominees until Barack Obama was elected and faced historic blockades. **Then Trump came along and became the record holder** in just part of a term, according to a POLITICO analysis of Senate votes.

That supports what I've been saying. It's getting worse.
 New standards of partisan opposition are set every cycle. Four years ago Dems obstructed what is normally a perfunctory exercise (certifying the electoral college results). I gave those details in [this reddit post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/arizonapolitics/comments/jq19bv/trump_campaign_files_lawsuit_in_arizona_alleging/gbmtz2f?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

That ties into how Dems were seeking impeachment before Trump was even sworn in. They were calling him illegitimate from the beginning.

Now that we have Trump out, the winner has a *spectacular* 8.4 ***tenths*** **of one percent** gain in popularity compared to Hillary.[1] The ""Great Repudiation"" we were encouraged to witness has manifested **that** strongly. Dems lost seats in the house. And, an entire 8 tenths of one percent repudiation.[1]

My point is: I think we will continue to see more of the same. The public clearly didn't give Biden Inc a majority ""mandate."" Dems in the house weren't fortified, right? There was no ""great repudiation"" that Dems (& there ""Alliance of Bias"" media"") didn't lead us to expect. Their hand was clearly overplayed, right? Voters, who [a poll has shown to have massive distrust for Big Media.](https://knightfoundation.org/press/releases/gallup-knight-poll-americans-concerns-about-media-bias-deepen-even-as-they-see-it-as-vital-for-democracy/) It's not like the media will be able to keep up its one-sided narrative.

I would expect this kind of theater to continue. Much more of the same two-party gamesmanship Bread & circus. 

Pointing to the other side to justify that may soothe your soul. I see it as bad either way.

[1] Biden won by 2.93% popular vote. Compared to Hillary 4 years ago by 2.09%? A 0.84% increase in popularity against the ""illegitimate"" president (as Dems called him from Day 1)."

- **Project**"
5152,2020-11-09 19:02:30,jqin81,"Actually, the whole obstructionism began under Bill Clinton by Republicans with the first major jump in filibusters; so thank Republicans for that. Your very own article indicates this in their graph which you'd be wise to critically-analyze with a little more depth before reactively responding. Ultimately, the article should read: ""Bill Clinton received the most until George Bush... Until Barack Obama (the biggest leap), until Donald Trump"" (though the nuclear option already was removed and it really didn't block anything substantively given Trump is still happily appointing ""Acting"" positions willy-nilly). To be clear, Reid removed the hurdle for Federal Judges, and McConnell took it a massive step further and removed the 60-vote threshold for The Supreme Court -- a step Reid knew not to cross for the integrity of the Supreme Court. Provided we know McConnell's intentions from the OUTSET of Obama's presidency to obstruct at every turn, we know they had no legitimate merit to block routine appointments. Then Trump goes on Twitter and says, ""Obama left us all these judges!"" haha, no he didn't silly -- Republicans blocked him from doing basic duties of the Presidency.

So set aside for a moment the notion of that you're equating blocked Cabinet appointments with:

- Record **Legislative** Cloture filibusters
- Record **Federal judicial** filibusters
- Even blocking bipartisan-supported Supreme Court Nominees like Merrick Garland.

.. All of which Trump and the Republican-controlled Senate has had free reign on. This makes your argument disingenuous and subject to a major false-equivalence fallacy. The only reason the blocks are so much is because there's so much revolving corruption in Trump's administration (record number of convicted staff of the White House; record number of turnover of cabinet positions).

And look, the disparity has widened even further amidst the popular vote; Biden is on-track to winning Georgia and has certainly won Arizona -- both long-time Republican strongholds; and sure the demographics are changing, but that's what happens when Republicans go the exact opposite direction of their own 2012 Republican Autopsy report. Without lying, cheating, and stealing -- Republicans will never hold office again. Trump said they had a mandate without even obtaining the popular-vote in 2016; then two-years-later he summarily lost the House of Representatives decisively. Now Trump holds the rare loser title of being the only President to lose the popular vote twice. This is a full repudiation, in spite of the voter-suppression and in spite of the findings of foreign-interference to tilt the odds in favor of Republicans. 

If Trump and his cult claimed a mandate in 2016, then this means Biden *definitely* has a mandate with a decisive popular-vote victory, (anticipated to be 6-8 million greater, blowing away Hillary's 3-million lead), and decisive electoral college lead. It's time to let the educated adults into the room and clean house.

Any challenge on a specific claim I made, I'll be happy to provide a source.

Also, because these were clearly dodged, I'll just reiterate these points again:

- Within the first year [McConnell already said their number-one goal was to make Obama a 1-term President.](https://youtu.be/W-A09a_gHJc) -- Guess Dems succeeded where he failed.

- Fox News was blabbering about atrocities like tan suits, Dijon mustard, and wearing bicycle helmets lol

I'm curious. What would make you happy as a reply from me? Write a reply that you wish I'd make.

My impression is all you want to say is: ""they did it, so it's ok. Swirling the drain with media corruption isn't a problem. As long as we can point at each other as we swirl by."" You don't really need me to say anything, other than to give you opportunities to say ""they did it too.""

I totally agree. Both sides are messed up. Massivelly. Things are getting worse. If you apply the ""major double-standard"" standard to ""mainstream"" media, you'll see that that's something getting much worse. I also agree that each cycle of election, each side takes their ""opposition"" further.

I would expect the same this time. Especially when Biden ""Tsunami of Repudiation"" was just 8.8 TENTHS OF 1 PERCENT higher than Hillary's (four years earlier). And, Dems actually lost seats in the house.

To make 💘 America 🇺🇸 respected 😇 around 🧱🎶🎵 the world 🌎 again ❌😬 and to unite 🛠✊ us 👨 here at home 🏠.   
  
It is the honor ✊🏻 of my lifetime 🏴‍☠️ that so many 👬 millions 😂 of Americans 🇺🇸 have voted 📨 for this vision 👀.   
  
And now the work 💼 of making 🖕 this vision 👁 real 💯 is the task 👾😡🌂 of our time ⏰.   
  
As I 👁 said 💬 many 👬 times 🕐 before 😂, I’m Jill’s husband 👫.   
  
I 👁 would not be here without 🚫🙅 the love ❤😘 and tireless 🏋 support 👍 of Jill 💪🏻, Hunter 🦈🏹, Ashley 😉💋, all 💯 of our grandchildren 👶💕 and their spouses, and all 💯 our family 👪.   
  
They are my heart 💔.   
  
Jill’s a mom 👪 — a military 🔫 mom 👩🏼‍⚕️🐎 — and an educator 🎓.   
  
She 👩👀 has dedicated 🕵♂ her 👩 life 💓 to education 🎓, but 🍑 teaching 👩‍🏫 isn’t just what she 👩 does — it’s who she 👧 is. For America’s educators 🎓, this is a great 👍 day 📆: You’re going 👉🏼 to have one 1️⃣ of your 👉 own in the White 🏳💅🏼 House 🏠, and Jill 💪🏻 is going 🏃 to make 💘👼🏼🌌 a great 👍 First 🥇 Lady 👩.   
  
And I 👁 will be honored 🏅🥇🏆 to be serving ™🍦 with a fantastic 💯 vice 👿😡😱 president 🇺🇸 — Kamala 🤯 Harris 👩🏽‍💼 — who will make 💘 history 📂📜📚 as the first 👆 woman 👩, first 👆 Black ⬛ woman 👧😕❓, first 🥇 woman 👩 of South ⬇ Asian 😑 descent 👌, and first 🥇 daughter 👧🏾 of immigrants 🚢👨‍👩‍👧‍👧 ever 😠 elected 😈 to national 😺 office 🏢🗄 in this country 🏞.   
  
It’s long 🍆 overdue, and we’re reminded 👉 tonight 🌑 of all 💯 those who fought ⚔ so hard 🍆💦👀 for so many 👬 years 🗓👶👴 to make 🖕 this happen 💦🍆😍. But 😠🍑 once again ❌😬, America 🇺🇸 has bent 😈 the arc 🌈 of the moral 😇 universe 😱 towards ⛪ justice ✊🏿.   
  
Kamala 🤯, Doug 🏳️‍🌈 — like 💦👍 it or not — you’re family 👪. You’ve become 😌 honorary 👑 Bidens and there’s no 😣 way 💫 out.   
  
To all 💯 those who volunteered, worked 🏢 the polls 📊 in the middle 🖕🏼 of this pandemic 🦠, local 📰 election 😱 officials 🏢 — you 👉 deserve 👌 a special 👉😎👈 thanks 🙏🏻 from this nation 🇺🇸.   
  
To my campaign 🗳 team 🐒, and all 💯 the volunteers 🙌🙋, to all 💯 those who gave 🎁 so much 🔥 of themselves to make 🖕 this moment 😳 possible 🤔, I 👥 owe 👅👄💦 you 👈🏼 everything 💯.   
  
And to all 💯 those who supported 🤝👊🏿 us 👨: I 👁 am proud 😤 of the campaign 💰 we built 🔧🔨 and ran 🏃. I 👁 am proud 😤 of the coalition 🇺🇸 we put 😏 together 👥, the broadest and most diverse 🌈 in history 📂📜📚.   
  
Democrats 🐴, Republicans 🐘 and Independents 👤.   
  
Progressives 🌷🌼, moderates 😬 and conservatives 👨‍💼.   
  
Young 👶👱🏻 and old 👴.   
  
Urban 🌃, suburban 🏘 and rural 🏞.   
  
Gay 🌈, straight 💑👫, transgender 👉🤷‍♀️🤷‍♂️.   
  
White ⚪♂. Latino 🙆. Asian 🍚. Native 👹 American 🇺🇸.   
  
And especially 🙌 for those moments 😳 when ⏰ this campaign 💰 was at its lowest 🍆💦 — the African ➡🌍 American 🇺🇸 community 🌎 stood 😤😬 up ⬆ again 😬 for me. They always 🔥 have my back 🔙, and I’ll have yours.   
  
I 👁 said 🗣💬 from the outset I 👁 wanted 😍 a campaign 💰 that represented 🅱 America 🇺🇸, and I 👁 think 🤔 we did that. Now that’s what I 👁 want 😋 the administration 💩 to look 👀💗 like 👍.   
  
And to those who voted 📨 for President 🤵 Trump 👑, I 👁 understand 🤔 your 👉 disappointment 🙃 tonight 🌑🌌.   
  
I’ve lost 💸 a couple 👌 of elections 😱 myself.   
  
But 🍑 now, let’s give 🎁 each other a chance 🚫.   
  
It’s time ⏰⌚⏳ to put 🔛 away 😂 the harsh 😖 rhetoric 📖.   
  
To lower ⬇🅱 the temperature 🌡.   
  
To see 👀 each other again ❌😬.   
  
To listen 👂 to each other again ❌😬.   
  
To make 💘 progress ➡, we must 🔒 stop ❌✋ treating 🍭🍫 our opponents 🙅‍♀️ as our enemy 😼👌💥.   
  
We are not enemies 😼👌💥. We are Americans 🇺🇸.   
  
The Bible ⬅ tells 🗣 us 👨 that to everything 💯 there is a season 🙌 — a time 🕐🕑🕒 to build 🍆👉🏢, a time 🕐 to reap 🛸, a time 🕐👋 to sow 🐄. And a time 🕐 to heal 😇.   
  
This is the time ⏰ to heal 🍆💦 in America 🎇🎊🇺🇸.   
  
Now that the campaign 👉🙋🏼‍♂️ is over 😳🙊💦 — what is the people’s will? What is our mandate 🚔⚖🏠?   
  
I 👁 believe 🙏 it is this: Americans 🇺🇸 have called 📲 on 🔛 us 👨 to marshal 🇱🇷 the forces 🖐 of decency ✅ and the forces 🖐 of fairness 👒. To marshal 🇱🇷 the forces 🖐 of science 🔬 and the forces 👊 of hope 🙏🙌 in the great 👍 battles 💥 of our time ⌚⏰⏱.   
  
The battle ⚔🔫💣 to control 🎛 the virus 🦠💉💦.   
  
The battle 💥 to build 🏢 prosperity 💰.   
  
The battle 💥 to secure 🔒 your 👉 family’s health 🥗 care 💅.   
  
The battle ⚔ to achieve 🎉🎊🏆 racial 🏃‍♀️ justice ⚖🙌 and root 💦 out systemic racism 🤜🏻💥👶🏾 in this country 🏞.   
  
The battle ⚔💥 to save 📑 the climate 😤💔😑.   
  
The battle 💥💀 to restore 💯 decency ✅, defend 💪 democracy 🐴, and give 🎁 everybody 👥 in this country 🇺🇸🏞🌎 a fair ⭐ shot 🔫.   
  
Our work 💼 begins 🔘 with getting 🉐 COVID 👑 under 😀 control 🎛🗼.   
  
We cannot 🚫❌ repair 🙌 the economy 💵, restore 👊 our vitality 💖, or relish 😻👌🏽 life’s most precious 💎⬆ moments 😳 — hugging 🤗 a grandchild 👶🏿💦, birthdays 🎁🎉🎈, weddings 👰, graduations 🎓🔝, all 💯 the moments 😳 that matter 🙅 most to us 👨 — until we get 🉐 this virus 💦😷 under 😀 control 🎮.   
  
On 🔛 Monday ‼, I 👁 will name 📛 a group 👥 of leading 💰 scientists 🔬 and experts 😎 as Transition 💊🏳️‍🌈 Advisors 🚫 to help 💁 take 👊 the Biden-Harris COVID 😷😻 plan 📝 and convert 🙍🏼 it into an action 🎭 blueprint 🐾 that starts 🆕 on 🔛 January 🌨☃ 20th 💯🎂, 2021 💀😡.   
  
That plan 📝 will be built 👷‍♀️ on 🔛 a bedrock 🛌💎 of science 🔬. It will be constructed 🔨 out of compassion 💯, empathy 👯, and concern 😕.   
  
I 👥 will spare 🔯 no 😣 effort 😩😫💪🏻 — or commitment 💍💏 — to turn ↪ this pandemic 🦠 around 🔃.   
  
I 👁 ran 🏃 as a proud 😊 Democrat 🐴. I 👁 will now be an American 🗽 president 🇺🇸. I 👥 will work 💼 as hard 🍆 for those who didn’t vote 🗳 for me — as those who did.   
  
Let 🙆 this grim 💀 era 💦 of demonization 😈 in America 🇺🇸 begin 🖤🤠🐎 to end 🔚 — here and now.   
  
The refusal ❌ of Democrats ⬅ and Republicans 🐘 to cooperate 🧠🗿 with one ☝🙋 another 2️⃣ is not due ☑🔘 to some mysterious ❓ force 🖐 beyond 👉 our control 🎛.   
  
It’s a decision 👯. It’s a choice 🤔 we make 💘.   
  
And if we can decide 🤔 not to cooperate 🧠🗿, then we can decide 🤔 to cooperate 😇. And I 👥 believe 🙏 that this is part 🍆💦🍑 of the mandate 🚔⚖🏠 from the American 🗽 people 👨👩. They want 😋 us 👨 to cooperate 🧠🗿.   
  
That’s the choice 🤔 I’ll make 💘. And I 👁 call 📲 on 🔛 the Congress 💩 — Democrats 🐴👯🙏🏻 and Republicans 🐘 alike 👈😎 — to make 🖕 that choice 🤔 with me.   
  
The American 🇺🇸 story 📖 is about 💦 the slow 😍🍝😳, yet 😇 steady ⏳ widening 👁 of opportunity 🚪.   
  
Make 💘 no 🚫 mistake 😱: Too many 👬 dreams 💭 have been deferred for too long 🍆.   
  
We must 👫 make 💘 the promise 🤞 of the country 🇺🇸 real 😍 for everybody 👥 — no 🚫 matter 🙅 their race 🏃‍♀️, their ethnicity 👳‍♂️, their faith 🚫⛪, their identity 👙💦👌, or their disability 🥔♿.   
  
America 🇺🇸 has always 🔥 been shaped ✴ by inflection points 📍 — by moments 😳 in time 🕙🕚🕐 where we’ve made 👑 hard 🍆🤤 decisions 👯 about 💦 who we are and what we want 😋🔁🐐 to be.   
  
Lincoln 👴🏻 in 1860 — coming 💦🏊 to save 💾 the Union 🇺🇸.   
  
FDR 🥵 in 1932 — promising 💭 a beleaguered country 🏞 a New 🆕 Deal 🙅.   
  
JFK 👅 in 1960 👴🏻 — pledging a New 🌑🆕 Frontier 🏜🏕🏞.   
  
And twelve 🕛 years 📅 ago 🔙 — when ⏰ Barack 👨🏿‍⚕️ Obama 👦 made 👑 history 🚫 — and told 🗣 us 👨, “Yes, we can.”   
  
We stand 🚹 again 😬 at an inflection point 📍.   
  
We have the opportunity 📊 to defeat 🗡 despair 😧😭 and to build 🏭 a nation 🇺🇸 of prosperity 🍀 and purpose 😄.   
  
We can do it. I 👁 know 🤔➡ we can.   
  
I’ve long 🍆 talked 🗣💬 about 💦 the battle 💥 for the soul 👻 of America 🇺🇸.

Tonight 🌉🌚🌜, the whole 💦😍 world 🌎 is watching 👀 America 🎇🎊🇺🇸. I 👁 believe 🌈 at our best 👌💯 America 🇺🇸 is a beacon 👀🎃 for the globe 🌎🌍🌏.   
  
And we lead 👑 not by the example 🔥 of our power 💪, but 🍑 by the power 💪 of our example 💪.   
  
I’ve always 🔥 believed 💭 we can define 🔥😎 America 🇺🇸 in one 😤 word 📝: Possibilities 🤔.   
  
That in America 🇺🇸 everyone 👥 should be given 😂 the opportunity 📊 to go 🏃 as far 🌌 as their dreams 💭 and God-given ability 💪 will take 👊 them.   
  
You 👈 see 👀, I 👁 believe 🌈 in the possibility 🤔 of this country 🏞.

Ahead 🙎 to an America 🇺🇸 that never 🚫 leaves 🎺🌳🍃 anyone 🙋 behind 👟.   
  
Ahead 🙎 to an America 🇺🇸 that never 👎🙅❌ gives 🎁 up ⬆, never ❌ gives 🎁 in.   
  
This is a great 👍 nation 🇺🇸.

This is the United 🇺🇸 States 📔⚖⚜ of America 🇺🇸.

And boy did he have Joe’s number “ Joe you have a certain arrogance about you, you want to tell the Iraqi people how to run their country”.

What a damn shame that voices of reason are marginalized or removed from public discourse."

It had started much much earlier, but this moment just accelerated it."
5166,2020-11-08 23:36:15,jqhn9a,"> “ Joe you have a certain arrogance about you, you want to tell the Iraqi people how to run their country”.

Reminder that [Biden ran an entire presidential campaign, on creating ""Ethnic Enclaves"" in Iraq](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/30/world/americas/30iht-letter.1.6894357.html), even though [everyone warned him it would lead to genocide.](https://theintercept.com/2019/09/06/joe-biden-defends-record-iraq-including-plan-divide-along-sectarian-lines/) He didn't care and kept preaching it anyway, even as he was losing, trying to turn it into a widespread accepted policy.


Then Obama made him his VP to comfort the more conservative elements of the Dem party."

5181,2020-11-08 19:17:12,jqh802,John McCain. One of the last true American heroes in politics.
5182,2020-11-08 19:48:29,jqh802,I really liked John McCain. He was a true patriot.
5183,2020-11-08 19:15:37,jqh802,[I think Ben Affleck had a perfect response to this](https://youtu.be/XuOuTDBaX8E)

5186,2020-11-08 19:46:12,jqh802,When republican candidates would actually disagree with racists.
5187,2020-11-08 20:32:06,jqh802,Sometimes fate just sucks. McCain would've probably beat any other Democrat to become president. He probably would've been a great president too. I really wish we had him after Obama.
5188,2020-11-08 20:15:24,jqh802,"I really respected John McCain. He fought against torture and human rights abuses worldwide. 

But let’s not forget that he legitimized the extremist tea party wing of the Republican Party by putting Sarah Palin on the ticket. He’s not blameless for the downfall of the GOP and the descent into toxic identity politics."
5189,2020-11-08 20:28:00,jqh802,"John McCain is the type of human being we should all, especially us Americans during these tremulous times, strive to be like."
5190,2020-11-08 20:30:08,jqh802,"I think if McCain ran instead of trump, he would’ve beat Biden. Trump brings out the worst in people."
5191,2020-11-08 20:38:16,jqh802,"Its funny but not, that we want john. I disagreed with him but would and did respect him as leader. I did not amd never will respect trump"
5192,2020-11-08 20:40:18,jqh802,"How did the Republican Party fall so far, so fast, and so hard? I never liked McCain but at least I respected him."
5193,2020-11-08 20:40:55,jqh802,Imagine how this exact situation would have played out if you swapped McCain with Trump?
5194,2020-11-08 20:42:11,jqh802,why isn’t he the president
5195,2020-11-08 19:38:09,jqh802,And now the GOP hates John McCain. They just clutch to whatever cult of personality their handlers point them to.
5196,2020-11-08 19:48:47,jqh802,It’s always a good thing when a party leader can tell his supporters to shut the fuck up when they’re wrong
5197,2020-11-08 20:00:08,jqh802,She looks like trump from behind
5198,2020-11-08 20:12:00,jqh802,John McCain was a fucking gem. If only there was a young John McCain waiting in the wings to make the Republicans respectable again.
5199,2020-11-08 20:19:09,jqh802,"It was great to see that Arizona voters remembered McCain, and what Trump said about him... that's karma."
5200,2020-11-08 20:19:50,jqh802,This woman can barely even string a sentence together...
5201,2020-11-08 20:22:19,jqh802,"I never agreed with McCain's policies, but I always thought he was an honorable man.  I also always thought that George W. Bush did what he thought was best for the country, though I disagreed with that.  With Trump, however, he is just a narcissistic psychopath, and has never done anything with the intent of benefitting the country, or anybody but himself."
5202,2020-11-08 20:23:18,jqh802,I still remember when this moment was shocking. Racism got a question answered at a town hall. Now it is tame.
5203,2020-11-08 20:23:41,jqh802,"What a calmer, simpler time"
5204,2020-11-08 20:24:29,jqh802,I think that McCain was trying to go in that direction that his opponent was a good person and that he wasn’t what the conspiracy theories were/are saying he had a moment to think of how to say it without sounding like he was endorsing Obama. He wasn’t commenting on Arabs.
5205,2020-11-08 20:25:16,jqh802,She’s exhibiting symptoms of Fox News Poisoning.
5206,2020-11-08 20:25:18,jqh802,Blows my mind to think just how far we have fallen as a society in the last few years. Hopefully this level of respect and civility can return.
5207,2020-11-08 20:25:30,jqh802,"Very cool. However I find it weird that it wasn't like ""ma'am being Arab doesn't make you bad and he's a good human"". It was more ""he's not an Arab he's a good person..."" Weird"
5208,2020-11-08 20:27:09,jqh802,The reaction of the women to the left though
5209,2020-11-08 20:31:00,jqh802,"Let me preface with this-John McCain was what the GOP should be about, minus the savings and loans scandal. With that said, his campaign exacerbated this mess we’re in with choosing Sarah Palin as his VP nominee."
5210,2020-11-08 20:37:52,jqh802,What a fine man! A real role model
5211,2020-11-08 20:39:13,jqh802,"I love this clip and have seen it several dozen times.

Class and integrity.

Before somebody goes off on me and lists John McCains mistakes, I know and guess what? We ALL make them. No one is a perfect human being and sometimes we are shitty human beings. What matters is what we do in-between those shitty times.

I am tried and true blue, a life long Democrat but John McCain definitely has a piece of my heart."
5212,2020-11-08 20:44:22,jqh802,Crazy how the republican party went for a decent man like McCain to a turd like trump.
5213,2020-11-08 20:46:50,jqh802,"See! Not all Republicans are bad!

(A lot of McCain love recently)

Is this an organised effort to begin the repair of the Rep. Party image? I dunno but it definitely looks like it."
5214,2020-11-08 20:52:31,jqh802,John McCain was a brave hero in more than one situation.
5215,2020-11-08 20:53:21,jqh802,He was the epitome of a true American Patriot
5216,2020-11-08 20:56:02,jqh802,Was that trump in drag?
5217,2020-11-08 20:59:35,jqh802,This man was nothing but class and respect. Hopefully enough people see these videos and remember what respect is. RIP
5218,2020-11-08 19:51:21,jqh802,"A true American, no matter his differences he remained a leader till the end. Imagine having a president who made fun of this man for being captured during his service to our country. Rip"

5222,2020-11-08 20:04:45,jqh802,"I remember watching this live at the time. As a Democrat, I have so much respect for John McCain and miss his influence in the GOP. A true patriot and American hero."
5223,2020-11-08 20:06:58,jqh802,Republicans of old. Never thought I’d say this but I miss them.
5224,2020-11-08 20:07:19,jqh802,These people were just waiting for Trump to come along
5225,2020-11-08 20:08:48,jqh802,Never thought I would say I miss *that* GOP
5226,2020-11-08 20:14:09,jqh802,I miss John McCain. I never agreed with him on much but I respected his approach to decency.
5227,2020-11-08 20:26:59,jqh802,In Germany we would call him „Ehrenmann“
5228,2020-11-08 20:37:03,jqh802,These mfs waited for their trump lmaooo. Such trashy dumb mfs
5229,2020-11-08 20:59:01,jqh802,How is that racist?

This is my last political themed comment"
5231,2020-11-08 21:05:27,jqh802,Why on earth was the likes of Trump allowed to run when there seem to be decent republicans out there?
5232,2020-11-08 21:15:39,jqh802,Was she saying he was an Arab?
5233,2020-11-08 21:45:49,jqh802,Watching old McCain clips like these gives me some hope for the next Republican candidate in ‘24.
5234,2020-11-08 22:53:29,jqh802,He would have been president but picking palin messed it up.
5235,2020-11-08 20:54:12,jqh802,And they say all Conservatives are heartless racist monsters! Eat your heart out!
5236,2020-11-08 19:38:03,jqh802,Pfft. A loser like that will never make it in the party of trump. /s
5237,2020-11-08 22:09:45,jqh802,"Wait, why can’t an Arab be a decent family man?"
5238,2020-11-08 20:50:44,jqh802,"This answer really isn't good enough and it's lauded as a beautiful answer. 

It's not.

His response should have been ""it doesn't matter if he's a Muslim, he can be whatever he wants, that's what makes this country great"".

Instead he steers it away, claiming ""no he's not, he's a good man"" inherently implying that being an Arab or a Muslim is bad but he's not one of THOSE. 

Same people that lap this up are the ones that shared and celebrated the grifters from The Lincoln Project."

5240,2020-11-08 20:24:07,jqh802,Total ass hat and a traitor to his party.  You don't get a pass just because you were a war hero.  Ran a horrible campaign also.  Now the media loved him for crossing the aisle until the stabbed him in the back.  That is what you get as RINO.
5241,2020-11-08 20:45:07,jqh802,"Damn, he would have made a good president, shame he didn't run in 2016."
5242,2020-11-08 20:59:26,jqh802,"His speech about having the honor of calling and congratulating Obama on winning the presidency is right there too. I may not have agreed with everything McCain believed, but there is no arguing with the quality of his character."

5246,2020-11-08 20:24:07,jqh802,The last true leader of GOP. The party died with him.
5247,2020-11-08 21:15:02,jqh802,If he were against anyone other than Obama he’d have won probably.

5252,2020-11-08 20:18:54,jqh802,Seems like the party is made up of that old woman now.

5254,2020-11-08 20:04:14,jqh802,Probably one of the 238k patriots who died for Don.
5255,2020-11-08 20:06:57,jqh802,It was really just the beginnings of the Trumpist mindset...though you can argue it started well before 2008. I felt bad seeing who McCain became during that year. Sarah Palin was just a colossal step in the wrong direction.

5257,2020-11-08 20:25:57,jqh802,Nothing has changed. It’s still the same Republicans they just feel comfortable saying every dumb thought out loud.
5258,2020-11-08 19:29:10,jqh802,What do you think Trumps responds would have been? I’m actually curious.
5259,2020-11-08 20:46:04,jqh802,Thanks for the ***
5260,2020-11-08 20:19:16,jqh802,A Patriot. I couldn’t fathom being a POW for five and a half years.
5261,2020-11-08 20:41:02,jqh802,"What exactly makes him a hero?

Edit: just asking a question since he was also a warmonger/criminal, making me wonder what offset that so much to consider him a hero."
5262,2020-11-08 20:31:41,jqh802,"I watched that, and he spoke eloquently, and I totally agree with him, but I don't think that McCain meant it that way. He was caught on the spot, and defended a good man against an old, causally racist white woman."
5263,2020-11-08 20:32:01,jqh802,I like this and I 100% agree with this but with context in mind I feel like McCain saw where she was going and squashed it before she got there. That's just the vibe I got.
5264,2020-11-08 20:14:27,jqh802,"He referred to him as a ""citizen"" though. Basically saying he's not Arab, but if he was - he's still a citizen and a good family man. It's a fine on the fly response to an asinine statement from that supporter."
5265,2020-11-08 20:56:26,jqh802,Bring back more McCains and you have a better chance of winning the middle.
5266,2020-11-08 20:21:00,jqh802,"Blame his VP pick for that. She was patient zero of that brand of republican insanity. He was pushing decency while she was pushing populist conspiracies.

Insiders say he really regretted that choice. It was an impulsive choice, she wasn’t properly vetted, and she refused to be reigned in or run a disciplined campaign."
5267,2020-11-08 19:28:10,jqh802,Obama isn't an Arab though.
5268,2020-11-08 19:48:39,jqh802,Fucking hell you dumb
5269,2020-11-08 20:47:13,jqh802,Just got too near the end of his journey. Would have been 10000x the president (and human) trump is
5270,2020-11-08 21:09:43,jqh802,Convince me he picked the right running mate.
5271,2020-11-08 20:04:48,jqh802,Trumps disrespect of the sailors from the USS McCain should have lived on as a mark of shame.
5272,2020-11-08 20:50:28,jqh802,"I first saw him when I moved to Arizona in the late 90s.  I disagreed with him on a lot of subjects, but he instantly had my respect for the way he was genuinely willing to listen to the other side and come to middle-ground on issues."
5273,2020-11-08 20:40:42,jqh802,He was a good dude. I would have supported his Presidency had he won and hadn't been saddled with Palin.
5274,2020-11-08 20:21:51,jqh802,"Until you remember that he firebombed civilians in Hanoi

GIs mad x20"
5275,2020-11-08 20:13:21,jqh802,Sarah Palin did not help the situation
5276,2020-11-08 20:37:03,jqh802,"I was all team Romney until the Supreme Court vote exposed his hypocrisy.

I also used to kinda like Chris Christie. Don't get me wrong...I disagree with him fundamentally and his obsequious behavior to Trump negated anything I liked about him. And even prior to 2016 I'd never have voted for him or even trusted him with walking my dog because he's a major scumbag, but he makes me laugh and usually calls it like he sees it, which is why I don't mind seeing his commentary on ABC."
5277,2020-11-08 20:09:57,jqh802,"This is an incredible observation and the key element to Trump’s “leadership. I just want to repeat what you said, “Trump looked at that woman and saw an opportunity to be exploited.” You hit the nail on the god damn head.

McCain corrected people when they were wrong. People don’t like being corrected, but they go along with it because McCain was someone they respected. Trump, on the other hand, exploited their fears, exactly like Adolf Hitler did. This is why they worship him, he doesn’t stand up to their fears for them like a real leader should, he confirmed to them that they should be scared."
5278,2020-11-08 19:49:20,jqh802,Thing is white upper class is exponentially more racist than the poor. The poor all all in it together to a point but the upperclass will do things like create imaginary borders to maintain power and perpetuate a story of them vs us. If you dont believe would you hear some cletus yelling the n word and think man he might be right? Now think if that guy was a Peter in a suit. Who is more likely to get their voice heard and believed?
5279,2020-11-08 20:09:20,jqh802,I think she was the start of what the GOP is now.
5280,2020-11-08 20:03:02,jqh802,Lol true! I guess they picked her to fill the role of the “country common folk”
5281,2020-11-08 20:36:21,jqh802,I'm trying too.
5282,2020-11-09 01:24:27,jqh802,"Yep. Palin tapped into the stupid, also. A pioneer of dumb."
5283,2020-11-08 19:52:11,jqh802,And voted against making MLK day a holiday in AZ along with being against many civil rights matters.
5284,2020-11-08 19:39:54,jqh802,"With McCain, the bar was sitting about an inch off the ground. With trump, they just buried the bar and forgot about it."
5285,2020-11-08 20:25:01,jqh802,"Sadly that’s true, there is an endless cycle of hatred"
5286,2020-11-08 20:09:35,jqh802,You referring to the corona death toll? Come on now Broski. Thats bad taste. A lot of those people that died weren't and never were trump supporters. You just insulted a hell of a lot of dead people to sound witty on reddit.

5289,2020-11-08 20:59:35,jqh802,His thumbs down to save Obamacare?
5290,2020-11-09 13:15:44,jqh802,Policy aside. He had his morals and stuck to them. POW in possible the worst pow war to date. Comes back to lead Americans. Also he always treated the opposition with respect and dignity. Party aside.
5291,2020-11-08 20:57:51,jqh802,"in all fairness, and not to bring McCain down, but anal warts would have made a better president than trump lol


Édit also she said he’s an Arab and he’s like “no mam he’s a decent family man”

Lmao can’t arabs be decent family people lol"
5292,2020-11-08 20:33:49,jqh802,Trump ruined any credibility of the GOP being the party of the troops.
5293,2020-11-08 21:00:32,jqh802,"It did, the ghost of McCain came back and took Arizona away from trump...McCain and Lewis are fist bumping in heaven"
5294,2020-11-08 20:36:12,jqh802,"He was distinctly human.

I’m sure he had many sleepless nights because of what he did to others.

He was also kept as a PoW for years, with the option to get out because of his familial connections, he declined because he would have had to leave his fellow military members behind.

People aren’t all bad or good."
5295,2020-11-08 20:41:39,jqh802,Oh fuck off man
5296,2020-11-08 20:33:06,jqh802,"I for one firmly believe that Vietnam required a diplomatic and economic solution and not a military solution but it makes no sense what so ever to blame soldiers for bad policies. Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon as well as a vast number of their advisors are all deserving of scorn for Vietnam not McCain. I for one believe McCain was honorable and courageous."
5297,2020-11-08 20:28:07,jqh802,Trueeeee
5298,2020-11-08 20:20:28,jqh802,He would have had a much better chance with practically anyone else as a running mate.
5299,2020-11-08 20:42:47,jqh802,"Palin was the Proto-Trump. Opened the door for someone who had nothing to bring to table except ambition & self promotion. Actual governance was never a priority.

That said Palin would have been a far better POTUS then Trump."
5300,2020-11-08 20:26:26,jqh802,They did really need a woman as he was training with women big time. But they fucked up with vet with Palin. She turned out to be bat shit crazy of 3rd degree.

5308,2020-11-08 20:26:04,jqh802,That is scarily accurate
5309,2020-11-08 19:49:27,jqh802,"Why do you think this post is even here?  It's putting on display the stark contrast between what the GOP was and what it has become under Trump.  The entire point of this post is ""Can you even imagine what Trump would have done in his place?""  And we can... because we've seen it time and time and time again."
5310,2020-11-08 19:36:43,jqh802,Because he would pull a similar response to what you wrote without being so obvious.
5311,2020-11-08 19:38:32,jqh802,"Because we are admiring a true statesman and a good person. The whole point of the post was to draw a comparison to our current position. It was a logical comparison given your reaction. Calm down, if you can’t answer the question, I understand."
5312,2020-11-10 18:32:07,jqh802,Well I think his response was to her general inference that he's not a good person. But yeah that made me laugh when I first heard it too lol
5313,2020-11-08 20:45:48,jqh802,It wasn't starting multiple wars a decade prior?

5315,2020-11-08 20:36:53,jqh802,"It does make sense to blame someone who voluntarily joined the military, then carried out orders that involved dropping fucking napalm on residential areas. He’s not free from blame, and honestly makes less sense to claim he is free from blame. He chose to be there. 

I don’t see how it’s honorable or courageous to kill civilians and farmers from 8000 feet in the sky IMO."
5316,2020-11-08 20:48:43,jqh802,"She was also a vindictive cunt, just like Trump.  Look at how she tried to abuse her power to get her ex-brother-in-law fired."

Out of 100 people you MIGHT see 1 not wearing a mask. Everyone acting like Americans aren't following the rules are dumb. Almost everyone wears a mask and if you don't you get basically ridiculed. Yes even in the deep south where I live. BTW I got taught evolution in school as well 20 years ago. That seems to surprise people when they learn that.

Also, isn't the tri state a left leaning area? Weren't they the worst hit and make up over half the total deaths from that 1 month of March? Why you blaming trump supporters for that?"
5320,2020-11-08 20:52:01,jqh802,People have been putting up post like this one for days. It’s obvious that they are comparing John McCain to Trump but some people don’t care they will never see anything wrong with what Trump says or what he does.

War is terrible and that's a war that shouldn't have been fought but it wasn't McCain's decision to have America wage war in Southeast Asia.
5325,2020-11-08 20:43:04,jqh802,Did he know that he was dropping it on civilians? Or was he just told they were military targets? I would guess the latter.
5326,2020-11-08 20:51:59,jqh802,huh?
5327,2020-11-08 20:41:27,jqh802,"You just took his statement, called it false and then made a reductive statement yourself.  Just because Rebublican supporters where you live wear masks mostly doesn't at all mean that it happens everywhere even slightly.  Where I live it is close to 50/ 50 that older people are wearing masks.  Closer to 90 percent if they are wearing that Red ""I'm full of shit"" badge on their heads.  I live in the ""deep south"" as well, and you are completely off base on comparing SC to the rest of the Trump faithful."
5328,2020-11-08 21:08:08,jqh802,Well golly I should have thought about the fact that you aren’t allowed to criticize murderers unless you clean up their mess
5329,2020-11-08 20:46:19,jqh802,Difference is most of our screwups don’t involve blowing up dozens of civilians and leaving chemicals that deform babies. Just a lil woopsie there
5330,2020-11-08 20:51:59,jqh802,"So because he stayed in a POW camp that means what he did to those civilians doesn’t matter? That just overrides it? He may have destroyed dozens of families, and his bombs could still be deforming babies but he didn’t leave the POW camp until they released other Americans, so he’s a good guy in my book. Makes no sense to me whatsoever."
5331,2020-11-08 20:58:31,jqh802,"You are ignoring the time and the way society was then. Comparing what people understood and believed from one point in history to 50 & 60 years later just doesn't fly. It doesn't make things okay, just like dropping the bombs on Japan, horrific, but how many lives did it save in the long run? Vietnam was a fucked up war, but at the time there were few who truly understood it. McCain paid a very high price and suffered until death from that war as well. War isn't ever a delightful event."

Neoliberal hacks blaming AoC for the losses in the House. They're not realizing that they barely won the presidency with a historically unpopular president who had a pandemic on his hands as well as a recession. Why? Well they ran a Status Quo neoliberal candidate named Biden who people only voted for because they hated Trump. Truly, Trump and Coronavirus beat Trump, not Biden.

The Democratic establishment was once again blaming the left for their own failures and they've said ""something needs to change"" yet the only suggestions they've made so far is ""M4A bad, Green New Deal bad"" when those ideas are polling very well with Democrats and the population.

These hacks are going to be back here in 4 years still finding a way to blame Bernie, AoC, etc. and the Left when a Republican extremist like Tom Cotton gets the presidency.

I swallowed my pride and voted for Biden and so did many other progressives, along with independents, youth, PoC, etc. That won't happen again. I'm done with the DNC.

Trumpian serial losers literally don't have the capacity to take personal responsibility for their own behavior. Always looking for black/brown people to blame. *Surprise surprise.* These people were warned *every step of the way.*

> **I’ve been begging the party to let me help them for two years. That’s also the damn thing of it. I’ve been trying to help. Before the election, I offered to help every single swing district Democrat with their operation. And every single one of them, but five, refused my help. And all five of the vulnerable or swing district people that I helped secured victory or are on a path to secure victory. And every single one that rejected my help is losing. And now they’re blaming us for their loss.**

If this is how they behave, then I don't think it's unreasonable to think they're saboteurs *trying* to lose and destroy America. 4-8 more years of Nancy Pelosi shoveling millions of dollars into her husband's pocket while the country falls, and the Democrats will be running literal Neo-Nazis by the end of the decade."

I do think he tried to compromise too much, but it's easy to overstate how much he'd been able to completely ignore that. The public option was dropped because Lieberman wasn't on board, and Nelson was a a serious constraint on how far left the bill could go as well.

So completely giving up on the Maine Senators would have saved some time, but not sure how much... at the end of the day, you did need the marginal Democratic Senators on board and that wasn't such an easy lift either."

Normally when I experience bugs in games they’re just minuscule visual things that don’t really have too much effect on gameplay but this is the first time I’ve experienced a literal game breaking bug in a game. Im on the combat training part where you equip an inhaler to heal after you kill a bot with an Ajax and the game literally won’t let me use the inhaler. I’ve spammed up on the dpad, reloaded my save point and even tried restarting my ps5 and even after installing the patch update nothing has worked. The game literally broke before it even started! I really wanted to like this game but how am I supposed to give it any type of pass when it literally won’t let me play it? Idc if people say “the fan base was bitching about the constant delays so they had to satisfy them in some way.” If this is really the reason they released it in its current state how tf did they think they were gonna satisfy the fan base with this broken ass game? Not to mention they hid last gen gameplay and lied saying it “played pretty well” when it looks like shit. I literally can’t believe they charged people full price for this game and now I can’t even return it cause I have a physical copy I bought from Walmart and I lost the receipt so now I’m literally stuck here waiting for who tf knows how long until they release another patch update and I just gotta hope it addresses my specific situation, literally a load of bullshit"

1) expecting CDPR to deliver on their promise of the console experience;
2) expecting them to deliver on their promise of the most believable city in any open world games to date;
3) spending more money on marketing the above two points than actually developing them;
4) using 3) to lie to their trusting fans about all of the above.

However, half of the community is jumping on the bandwagon - just like everything else this year - because they're frustrated and have nothing better to do. This is happening to the extent where there is actually a stigma forming against people who enjoy the game - it's quite sad.

Like the game or don't - it's not anyone elses business and you certainly shouldn't chastise anyone else for their opinion.

I think the reason there has been such a backlash is because people think they've been conned by CDPR - they had unrealistic expectations that C2077 was going to be the game that everyone needed this year - propelling us into the next generation. The problem is no single game can do that - unfortunately.

In short - people were expecting a godlike game that was perfect in every way so they felt betrayed when this wasn't the case."
5460,2020-12-15 08:37:30,kdhtvy,"World feels dead. Outside of the scripted events, there is nothing to do.

&#x200B;

Gigs are repetitive and not fun in any way compared to witcher 3. 

&#x200B;

Geralt does not join factions because witchers are neutral in the lore however even Vesemir said they do side more against Nilfgaard

&#x200B;

We can choose a backstory for V. If only these affected the game. Street kid could be able to join a gang, nomads should be by themselves since they got kicked out of the group and corpo should be able join a private military as an officer or another megacorp maybe

Geralt's fighting style also changed based on gear and can change if you want to swap out different armor. In this game, you can not shift your fucking attributes whatsoever. Once you choose your playstyle that is the way you are playing."

5467,2020-12-15 09:21:28,kdhtvy,"Man I’ve specced almost fully into reflex and I still play however tf I want. If I wanna stealth I stealth, if I wanna shoot I shoot, if I wanna go melee I melee, and I can still hack people, go into cameras, etc etc. I am not stuck with pistols simply because I’ve mostly specced into them, literally all the other options are still effective. I’m looking forward to going all in on intelligence & seeing how that works out next playthrough. But idk man there is far more build variety than the witcher, which was just “kill them with swords signs or bombs”. 

As for your comparison to the witcher, that world is dead too outside of the side quests, unless nekker nests and bandit camps are somehow more exciting than NCPD bounties & gigs. The reason it doesn’t feel dead is because of the absolutely fantastic world building and characters shown off in the side quests & main storyline. Same as cp2077. The only reason cyberpunk feels worse is probably because a modern city demands more NPC interaction than a town in the 1500s - if you actually compare the two games, both have shitty npc AI, fairly useless and bland shops & economies, and not much going on outside of the quests. Difference is, you expect a lot more in a massive city than a town with 20 residents and one blacksmith. You have to stretch out your sense of immersion from the side jobs and main story a lot further in cyberpunk than you do in the witcher.

You don’t get to choose a faction because you’re a merc with 3 different possible backgrounds, you are no longer a nomad a corpo or a streetkid by the time the tutorial ends. There are lore reasons behind that too, mercs aka edgerunners dont pledge their allegiance to any factions, pretty sure that comes right outta the tabletop game. It would be cool if you could, but that would add a massive amount of bulk to a game that is already far too ambitious. Wishful thinking is fine but dont twist it into a complaint."

5469,2020-12-15 10:23:04,kdhtvy,"I think the actual truth of the matter is that the game itself doesn’t know what it is.

5470,2020-12-15 09:08:23,kdhtvy,"I mean I’ll try starting a new game sure, but the annoying thing is I shouldn’t have to. Like for real the basic mechanics of the game should work first time for literally everybody and shouldn’t require extra steps just to hope that it fixes. One thing I’m worried about though is I’ve tried googling the issue and saw that there’s a few people who came across the same issue as me but much later in the game where it’s much more crucial, and I don’t want that to happen to me but fuck it, I already bought the game anyways"
5471,2020-12-15 20:08:40,kdhtvy,"are you playing on easy difficulty or something? lmao I spec'd into stealth/handgun damage/technical and on very hard difficulty I die to enemies in 2-3 hits if I try going in running and gunning. Witcher's combat is way more interactive and requires you to dodge/parry at the right time especially if you are a player who doesn't want to cheese with quas(idk the shield thing). This game doesn't have that. The dodge is close to useless and actually fucks you up more if you are using stealth since you can't rebind any keys

The world in the witcher feels more alive because NPCs actually do things. They sing, they dance, and you see bodies hanging from trees, the environment is dark and grimy from the nations being at war. 90% of NPC's in this game are just slouch walking down the street.

How is it a complaint. People were looking forward to their life-path choices for years and CDPR didn't come out and say ""oh you're only playing as your life path for 24 minutes and has no effect on the story.""

They allowed people to think life-paths actually mattered when it doesn't matter at all. Might as well not even have it in the game since the only thing they do is some shitty dialogue options"
5472,2020-12-15 20:09:15,kdhtvy,i'm playing on PC. What I said has nothing to do with how the game runs
5473,2020-12-15 12:10:41,kdhtvy,"I don't think I'd agree on that. The game does have an identity, it's simply not what we the gamers thought it was. There's no evidence of a lack of leadership either.

The design of the game is polished and consistent. There's a huge amount of attention to detail given to the world and its sights and sounds. In terms of mechanics, the choices made are deliberate design choices that were clearly top-down choices.

The game's issues are not structural, but superficial and they can be fixed. That isn't to say the structure is great....I personally expected a cyberpunk RPG with first-person combat, but got an open-world adventure with a perk system. I don't like a few choices, I lament that so much was removed, like trains, sticking to walls/wall running, the origin stories and do feel a few things missing.

But this game doesn't suffer for lack of vision or ambition. My comment was about the issues with unbindable keys and memory usage on PC. The first can be modded in an XML file, the latter in a CSV, but the fact that they weren't PC friendly to start suggests a console game with controller maps ported directly to PC with an afterthought for the rest. Being unable to go back a page in the menus with the mouse is very frustrating."
5474,2020-12-15 09:39:26,kdhtvy,"Good luck! I mean I agree with you, obviously the game shouldn’t have been released like this. Buuuut I’ve been waiting for so fuckin long and have experience plenty of buggy games before, as well as spent a ton of hours modding skyrim and dealing with the expected fuckiness that results from that. I’m used to troubleshooting shit like this & don’t really mind it as long as I feel the game is worth the effort. & this one definitely is!"
5475,2020-12-16 02:13:21,kdhtvy,"I’m playing very hard too, are you playing console? Maybe it just feels better on mouse n keyboard. You’re really talking up witcher combat man even on max difficulty it was a very simplistic system, you may just prefer third person melee gameplay to an fps. & if you were paying attention, the thing about lifepaths has been known since they announced them -> literally every person who played the gameplay demo mentioned it was just a short intro & then dialogue options, and they explained the lore about mercs not picking sides in multiple interviews if I remember correctly. Their marketing wasnt misleading either, they literally showed you footage of the intro cutscenes in an NCW episode I think. So, wishful thinking or you got hyped based on some misinformation."
5476,2020-12-15 13:26:36,kdhtvy,"You may have misunderstood me about the game's identity: I meant it's not sure whether it's a console or PC game.

Re the design, I can't comment as I've opted to have my PS4 CE refunded, and I'm gutted; I was psyched enough to preorder a CE, and I've been burnt hard.

Regarding' the game's designs, from what I've seen and read, irrespective of bugs, the issues seem to be related not to the game's aesthetic design, but its mechanical design and how it doesn't lend itself to good dynamics: I'm largely pointing to what has been described as nonexistent AI.

This is a dealbreaker for me as I was expecting something that would surpass not only The Witcher 3, but GTAV and RDR2. Sadly, this is not that game, and I don't know if anything other than a complete overhaul can fix this. Simple patches just won't do, and even those simple patches may take 6-12 to fully implement.

For all intents and purposes - insofar as I'm concerned - this game is DOA on console."
5477,2020-12-15 18:08:55,kdhtvy,"Reading your comment was interesting, I just told my friend yesterday that this game must feel more natural on a computer. Especially with how clunky the menus are to navigate on console, but to hear it's didn't feel PC friendly either is surprising."

On PC, they've literally remapped LB/RB to 1 and 3. 1 and 3 to navigate tabs. I'm not joking.

I can select things with my mouse (ie. A button) but cannot go back to the last screen, that is ESC so I need both hands and multiple keys to navigate it. KotOR managed a tabbed menu on PC in 2005 without this much work.

Also, F5 quicksaves, which is great. But no quickload on F9. WHY?

1. I don't know what your defense of Vietnam is supposed to be, but it's still a one party dictatorship that fuels it's economic expansion through underpaid sweatshop manufacturing, which in my opinion is against the spirit of socialist egalitarianism.

2. Trade deals like this cede sovereignty to corporations, and make governments unaccountable to the public, and more accountable to these treaties. For example treaty organizations have allowed tobacco companies sue countries that institute plain packaging laws, or oil and mining companies to sue for cancelling projects. 

While I disagree with right wing populists on almost everything, they are correct that trade organizations erode sovereignty which is bad in this context because it shifts law making abilities to unelected obscure tribunals. Granted the US is too big to to have to follow the rules, the issue is more for poorer smaller countries who are at the mercy of G7 mining companies."

2. Well, you can vote to leave that if you really don't like that one. There had been many international organizations supposedly have made countries cede their sovereignty, but most of their decisions had been ignored when countries don't want to comply. 
TPP is all about you will be kicked out if you violate it's rules, and they can't send troops into your country to enforce anything, but perhaps there will be fines to pay if your country regrets leaving it."

That's just rhetoric employed by competing capital interests to get you to support their particular political persuasion and power base.

The only force capable of solving this dilemma is a united proletariat halting work, seizing existing productive forces and using them to transform production which is already both social (though indirectly so) and globalized into production that is directly social and comprised of free international association of working people.

5488,2020-12-15 19:16:28,kdgui1,"Okay but it doesn't matter if you tell me Vietnam is democratising, that doesn't make it true. Vietnam's ranking in political and personal liberties has not changed in the last 5 years, they're better than China in personal liberties but that's as low as the bar gets. Vietnam is at the very bottom of countries in terms of press freedoms as state by reporters without borders, only China, Djibouti, Eritrea, Turkmenistan and North Korea are worse, they are below Syria, Iran, Cuba and Saudi Arabia, and they haven't gotten better, they're ranking has been consistent for the last 5 years. The government tolerates strikes against foreign companies, not against the government. 

Yes you can vote to leave a treaty organization, but in the interim you have ceded your sovereignty. There are also substantial political and economic barriers to leaving once you are in, especially for smaller countries who are greatly pressured into staying with threats of withholding development funds. What I am saying is literally true. Your government ceases to have authority over particular aspects of it's policy, and this authority is given to an international tribunal which is unaccountable to your people and unelected. While it is nothing so dramatic as troops invading your country if you don't comply, fines imposed by these tribunals and sanctions for not complying with the organization in the form of withheld aid is punishing. 

Ecuador was recently fines the equivalent of their entire annual healthcare budget for cancelling the development of an oil field, and being sued by an American oil firm. Even if they win, you still have tiny countries with GDPs less than major American companies that can't afford to pay lawyers to fight years long legal battles. So instead of leaving or fighting they will just comply. What these organizations advocate is dystopian nightmare fuel, the kind of cyberpunk hellscape where policy is dictated by boards of shareholders."

It's not clear what advantage you claim China has over me, but I fail to see how it would be any different from other capital interests.  As for the advantage a Chinese worker has over me, none.  They, no more than I direct capital.

So clearly anything that requires plurality of people is going to be mostly workers, and essentially all skilled non-service workers in this country are seeing jobs get outsourced as education and training becomes more widely available in other countries.  That includes STEM work... So it's not clear why you think this has anything to do with Trump's base in particular which is much more rural, manufacturing, and manual labor.

It's not like Biden's xenophobic bullshit is somehow less pernicious than Trump's.  Biden is just smart enough to know that Mexicans actually live and work and have a say in whether or not he's elected, even if they can't vote.

> I not saying this will solve everything for good, but I can see why communists always fuck up in history.

History is not communists to fuck up in.  The failure of historical proletarian revolutions is, of course the failure of a proletariat widely underdeveloped and widely disorganized.  In its place, a state controlled by socialists / communists is not a suitable replacement.

Again... The proletariat is the only force capable of this.  The emancipation of the working class can only come from the working class itself, not the communists."
5496,2020-12-15 09:24:01,kdgui1,"From my perspective, the real problem with communists is that they can believe lesser evil is as bad as the ultimate evil, and in achieving their ultimate good they are allowed to commit lesser evil at the same time. There are good things worth trying right now, but no body bothers."
5497,2020-12-15 09:39:45,kdgui1,You sure do spend a lot of time thinking about who you prefer to rule over you and why.
5498,2020-12-15 10:27:03,kdgui1,"Okay, you can rule over yourself by betting everything on a dictator like what happened in history or do something to impress everybody to like you enough to let you do something instead of dreaming about an impossible scale of revolution somehow come true."
5499,2020-12-15 11:34:47,kdgui1,"Nobody bets on any ""dictator"".

The dictatorship of the proletariat means that the working class has full control over a country. It means that you STOP companies from moving jobs overseas and to low-income countries."
5500,2020-12-15 11:38:14,kdgui1,"Actually, everyone owns everything can only end up either you waste everything because you don't care or only a few of you own everything. In history, the waste of everything happens right after revolution, then the remaining goods ended up into hands of minority after centralization.

I am not telling you to F communism, but you have to figure out another way, and don't hold unrealistic imaginations on existing dictators. Instead of total revolution dream in the future, you should try to get some good deeds done right now.

I did quote that ""working men has no country"" did I?  This is because capitalists don't have country as well. Unless you lock up your entire country and all the capitalists, you are always too expensive to the jobs require less or average education. The only way to change this is to bring the world to your side. You may feel like that capitalists have won this time, but the most important thing is to prevent them from outsourcing jobs to a country without human rights. Vietnamese are not submissive slaves, and they have even larger proportion of socialists and communists than your country."
5501,2020-12-15 11:40:54,kdgui1,"No.

And stop taking drugs."
5502,2020-12-15 11:56:59,kdgui1,"Actually most Chinese believe doping is a Western leftist thing, and I am not sure of it."
5503,2020-12-15 06:06:26,kdg563,Reagan at number 1 is a hard pass for me.
5504,2020-12-15 10:06:23,kdg563,"How the hell are you gonna put Ronald Reagan over Abe Lincoln? Held the nation together during its worst crisis, freed slaves. Come on."
5505,2020-12-16 18:33:49,kdg563,Ronald “War on Drugs” Reagan is not 1
5506,2020-12-15 06:09:16,kdg563,What do you think about my other rankings?
5507,2020-12-15 12:41:36,kdg563,"Reagan helped the country through a economic crisis, saved everyone from nuclear weapons, strengthned the military, charismatic, great leader"
5508,2020-12-15 06:10:55,kdg563,"Decent for the most part. Nixon at nine is an eye catcher but regarding Watergate, I guess it makes sense."
5509,2020-12-15 15:06:16,kdg563,"I just don’t see it man. I don’t see how you can compare the monumental task before Lincoln to anything Reagan faced in the 1980s. I think saying he “saved everyone from nuclear weapons” is a stretch, even if you’re a fan of his. And outside of that qualification, the others can be attributed to Lincoln. The man literally saved the United States while ending its most embarrassing and disgusting institution."
5510,2020-12-15 16:15:13,kdg563,"Reagan saved the nation from embarrassment by

1. Ending the Cold War peacefully by forcing the USSR to drop its goal of world communism by challenging its legitimacy, regaining superiority in the arms race and advocated for human rights. 

2. Saved us from having a 2nd Great Depression. With 8 million jobs created, the prime interest plummeting to 10.5% from 20% and inflation dropping 4.1% after a dangerous 13.5%, and the stock market with the S&P 500 rocketing 120%. 

3. Invaded Grenada on October 25, 1983 that deposed of the communist leaders who gained control through a violent coup and rescued the 800 American medical students held captive there. 

4. Strengthened the military. He saw this strength as necessary to preserving security, stability, and ultimately peace in the world, and it was undergirded by his confidence in the goodness of the American people and the American nation.

5. In December 1985, five American citizens were killed in simultaneous terrorist attacks at the Rome and Vienna airports in an Libyan attack. Reagan ordered expanded sanctions and froze Libyan assets in the United States. On March 24, 1986, U.S. and Libyan forces clashed in the Gulf of Sidra, and four Libyan attack boats were sunk. This showed that America wouldn't coward down. 

6. Reshaped the nation's image that was weakened in the late 70s. 

So overall, yes, he did save the nation. If he was so bad, then why did he win in 2 landslides? I'm 16, but the way I see it is if a president wins in a landslide, it means Americans LIKE them."
5511,2021-01-03 03:19:51,kdg563,"This is insanity. Were you even alive then?  Conservatives have been actively advocating Reagan as great for a generation. But those of us who are rational and remember Reagan don’t believe the hype. 

To me, Reagan and his ilk in the government at that time caused the poisoning of the moral and civil discourse in this country that had caused the division we see in today’s society. 

Yes, he was that bad. Reagan, Newt Gingrich, Pat Buchanan, the Federalist Society, Grover Norquist, the Heritage Foundation, Focus on the Family, the Moral Majority—all cancers on America to this day. Those of us who lived it have trouble overlooking these cancers when we consider Reagan’s legacy."
5512,2020-12-15 06:20:15,kdg55l,"The only president in which I could see a valuable case to be worse than Buchanan is Wilson. Tyler shouldn't be that low (trust me I felt that way before I knew more about him). 

Obama at 6 really sticks out. Why is he so high? Same with Carter. Other than that, it's a pretty decent list."
5513,2020-12-15 07:24:41,kdg55l,"Coolidge is not ranked highly by historians because he didn’t face any major crisis in his time in office, I get why so many admire him but that doesn’t mean he was a great president. If the Great Depression had happened 4 years earlier Coolidge would have been regarded exactly how Hoover has been for decades. 

Despite what people on this sub want perceptions of his legacy to be, Wilson is not anywhere close to being the worst president."
5514,2020-12-15 16:51:40,kdg55l,How is Andrew Jackson worse than trump?
5515,2020-12-21 08:15:29,kdg55l,"I appreciate my position here, but believe JFK is far too high. Perhaps he moves to 9, or lower."
5516,2021-01-19 02:28:35,kdg55l,"I like how you ranked Coolidge at ten. Personally I would rank him no higher than 15, I admire how he stood firm, even when he could sign a bill to give aid to farmers, but that’s not the governments purpose, he made the executive office smaller, which would have had a good long term affect, almost every president after him expanded executive power, undoing his most important work for this country."
5517,2020-12-16 07:59:22,kdg55l,"I mainly ranked Tyler that low because of him being a Confederate Senator before his death, ultimately betraying the nation he once led. I'll look more into him though. Andrew Johnson was ranked lower than him because he stopped reconstruction. Obama was at six mainly cause he was an inspiring figure, who was the first Black President, but I guess he can go lower. Carter is high cause of how humane he was. I judged the Presidents by their overall lives, not just their presidencies. I can put him lower as well."
5518,2020-12-15 12:29:47,kdg55l,"Well Wilson fucked up Civil Rights more than any president, so he deserves AT LEAST bottom 10."
5519,2020-12-15 14:51:51,kdg55l,"Coolidge was fantastic economically, so I really don’t see how you could make that argument without even a minor sense of reluctance."
5520,2020-12-15 12:38:28,kdg55l,">Despite what people on this sub want perceptions of his legacy to be, Wilson is not anywhere close to being the worst president.

This"
5521,2020-12-16 08:02:43,kdg55l,"He isn't. Andrew Johnson is worse than Trump. Andrew Johnson was Lincoln's VP and basically tried to ruin reconstruction and got impeached. One vote saved him from removal from office. Andrew Jackson, although he treated Native Americans poorly, was the only President to fix the national debt and was the first Common Man President."
5522,2020-12-16 12:52:20,kdg55l,“First common man president” also the first millionaire president
5523,2020-12-16 16:27:56,kdg55l,"I guess that's true, but unlike the first 6, he wasn't a founding father, or a son of one."
5524,2020-12-16 16:45:54,kdg55l,He does have that going for him
5525,2020-12-15 08:54:31,kdes88,Nah

5682,2020-12-15 00:54:04,kd1k3s,As has been the plan all along. Keep all the racial groups at each others throats. Divide and conquer the oldest trick in the book.
5683,2020-12-14 19:03:11,kd1k3s,"Identity politics comprise the single greatest problem affecting (what passes for) the left.   Modern ""leftist"" movements actually have more in common with fascism than the traditional, egalitarian, class-based left.   Instead of the scapegoat being Jews or Muslims or Mexicans it is the straight white male.   These ""movements"" are authoritarian, censorious, anti-white, anti-male, obsessed with bourgeois culture, they empower corporations, they shun equal treatment in favor of ""positive discrimination,"" they are irrational, contemptuous of the working class.   They seem practically designed to repel ordinary people from the left.   

The problem is that the ""left"" is essentially a bourgeois affair rooted in universities.   It is largely divorced from working people.   Much of this is due to the purging of actual leftists from unions under McCarthyism, and the decline of unions in general.   The FBI's COINTELPRO also played a role (it tried to divide people based on race and sex), as did the CIA through its foundation financing of ""gender studies"" etc.   

This is one of the problems with the new People's Party.   While their economic proposals are sound, they are still aping the identitarian line of the Green Party.   They would be much better off if they just completely rejected identity/cultural issues entirely; but that is virtually impossible because millions of people now earn their livings pushing divisive identity politics, and an entire generation has been taught to define themselves according to their racial/sexual identities rather than through a class lens."

It's become so that they feel that there's no agile way to address this issue. If you're not for radical idpol as the ultimate goal, you must be against equality.

They need to say something to the effect that even though equality is important and a cornerstone of their values, the purpose of the party is to unite economic workers together to win economic gains for *everybody*, and that solidarity will do more to destroy bias than anything else, *because it has in the past*. (Maybe they do say this, I haven't read as much about it recently.)

The *primary target* of organizing needs to be workers in the Marxist sense, even if it's at the expense of radical liberals. They aren't the vanguard they think they are, or maybe they are in regard to their own values. They're also a small percent of the organizable population, they're just disproportionately loud. They'll get on board eventually or... they were always our class enemies and this will shine some light on it.

The biggest problem we wrestle with should be how to unite blue and white collar workers, not worry about all of this tangential shit. Radical liberals may mean well, but they aren't the ""left"".

They have less chances of their upward mobility being destroyed by the system. It is harder for a non white person in the same situation as rural America to escape their fate and when they occasionally do, it takes a lot less to have it all taken away. I'm not talking about outcomes which is what you are talking about. ""the world as their oyster' refers to opportunities given to white people vs non white people irrespective of other circumstances. 

As a result, there is a 'chilling' effect in that less non-white people are even willing to stick their necks out to help others in fear of losing what they have. This is partly the reason the black community did not want to take a risk with Bernie. This is also evident in how the police try to target minorities that stick their neck out protesting or non white people being more likely to be 'cancelled' if they express views that stick out. 

>That attitude, most memorably expressed by Hillary Clinton when she referred to working class ""white"" people as ""a basket of deplorables"", is exactly why the Democratic Party has alienated millions of working people whose only crime is the color of their skin.

You are dealing in absolutes. I am referring to likelihood. If anything this year should have shown how fragile their lives can be. Not every upper class non white person is more privileged than a poor white person and the opposite is also true at the same time. Its about likely scenarios and that is determined by how the system operates. In this capitalist system you can achieve wealth and prestige regardless of the color of your skin but does not mean you have a safety net against losing everything in a blink of an eye. To say something like that is an insult to the struggles and fear that non white people in this country still have, regardless of wealth or prestige. 

Hell the squad touched upon this very topic when it comes to communities of color: Ilhan and AOC have touched upon the fact that if you are in the suburbs and white, the local community goes out of its way to ensure people don't end up in jail by finding alternatives to jail time. But if you are in a community of color, you are more likely to be sent into the system if you screw up because the protections are not there. This can happen regardless of income.

This is not to say there aren't differences almost all the way down the line: poor black people are in the main even poorer than poor white people. But it does mean that when you tell the 80 percent of white people who have less than 15 percent of white wealth that the basic inequality in the U.S. is between black and white, they know you are wrong. More tellingly, if you say the same thing to the 80 percent of black people in the same position, they also know you're wrong.  It's not white people who have white wealth; it's the top ten percent of whites, plus some Blacks and Asians. The wealth gap among all but the wealthiest blacks and whites is dwarfed by the class gap, the difference between the wealthiest and everyone else across the board.

>""The wealth gap among all but the wealthiest blacks and whites is dwarfed by the class gap, the difference between the wealthiest and everyone else across the board.""

>Trying to solve the problem of racial disparity thus has nothing to do with producing economic equality; rather, it replaces the goal of equality with the goal of proportional inequality. The disparitarian ideal is that blacks and other nonwhites should be represented on every rung on the ladder of economic hierarchy in rough proportion to their representation in the general population. Instead of worrying about inequality, it worries about the inequalities that have been produced by racism. Obviously, this does nothing for poor white people. But, also obviously, it does nothing for most poor Black people. In its insistence that proportionality is the only defensible norm and metric of social justice, anti-racist politics rejects universal programs of social-democratic redistribution in favor of what is ultimately a racial trickle-down approach according to which making more black people rich and rich black people richer is a benefit to all black people.

So looking at his study he first admits that his sample size is 5,114 after admitting that the larger sample size would introduce the ability to identify details about the people being studied. Not a good start. He then limits the age range from 24-32 Males. Again I understand why he does so but it further places doubt into the results especially since he is using how close some of the results in the upper class strata are to argue that they are not relevant. They could be more relevant if he didn't restrict the data to begin with. 

Finally he focuses only on African-Americans and drops all other races. That is the final nail in the coffin as our whole discussion was based on non-white people vs white people. 

This completely ignores the situations where other non-white groups are also suffering. For example, people from the middle east are grouped in different races but can be suffering from the same systemic outcomes. Middle eastern people are some of the best upwardly mobile groups in all of America with a significant percentage pursuing and achieving professional and managerial class status. Yet they are systematically discriminated against in places such as pursuing higher office, they are more likely to be targeted than poor white people when attempting to protest against the government and they are systematically targeted when associating with groups that oppose popular American policies such as support for Israel. How can any serious study just dismiss the experiences that all of the other non white people experience(again, regardless of class status). This is the chilling effect I was referring to in my original comment in that even with Trump gone, non white people always have to ""look behind their back"" because the system is set up to target them more harshly than white people. 

While he dismisses this as inconsequential by trying to equalize the data, I believe that we cannot just dismiss his findings that indeed black people are more discriminated against regardless of class. Yes I agree that it happens less often the higher up the class strata you go which seems to indicate that both you and I are correct to an extent but every class strata shows that number being higher for non white people. If you look at the numbers he presents just as they are, the data is directly supporting my theory. 

You second article is completely unrelated to my point which to reiterate: *Regardless of wealth there is still systemic discrimination that creates a chilling effect on non white people and an unseen advantage for white people*. Thats what triggered this whole thread. The voter switching to Trump may have difficult economic prospects but he still exists in a system that serves not only rich people but also prioritizes white people of any class. He isn't actually affected by IdPol, its just a nuisance he has to see in his day to day life in things such as the news or in movies. Meanwhile that systemic discrimination will follow many non white people no matter how successful they get. 

Just increasing the wealth of non white people will not solve this fundamental discrimination in the system and in that sense I am in agreement with the second article, however again that was not my point."

Good point.   Had he included eg Asians, who tend to be wealthier than whites, I suspect he would have found that they are treated better by the criminal justice system, on average.   

> systemic discrimination

If you're concerned about ""systemic discrimination"" then gender should be your primary concern.   The gender gap in eg criminal sentencing completely dwarfs any gaps in terms of race (in favor of women).   Basically, if were were chart what degree of focus a particular issue deserves based on actual proven discrimination, then class would take up most of our attention, followed by gender, followed by mental illness, then maybe 5 percent would be devoted to race.   Instead we're doing the exact opposite.   Which is irrational.    

In terms of the alleged advantages whites have, well to the extent that these can even be said to exist they are rapidly going by the wayside.   Major corporations and banks like JP Morgan are pledging to end ""racial disparities"" to the tune of billions.   Why are they doing this?   They are doing this because they want us fighting over race rather than class.   They don't want us supporting universalist solutions that would help all poor and working class people and encourage class solidarity; and neither do the race huxters, because then they'd be out of a career.

What may well happen in the US, if current trends continue, is that poor whites will end up at the bottom of society.   This is what happened in the UK, where a recent equality report found that ""poor white boys"" now ""get the worst start in life"" compared to every other demographic.   This situation arose because of people like you: state agencies devote all of their resources to helping women and non-whites, so naturally white males are left out.

Do you have any evidence to show this? Also Asian Americans constitute a wide variety of ethnic groups which have wildly different outcomes.

Gender gap may affect one aspect of this systemic discrimination but did you even read the examples I gave that further described what I am referring to when I say systemic discrimination? It does not only include criminal sentencing. Frankly you are side stepping from my entire point.

None of this has anything to do with the systemic discrimination that I am talking about. Let me repeat my point yet again....**Regardless of wealth there is still systemic discrimination that creates a chilling effect on non white people and an unseen advantage for white people.**

Your scenario with JP Morgan chase would not affect this system in any manner. To follow your example lets say JP Morgan favors minorities to rise the ranks and become wealthy(A trend that actually is not happening, they usually end up in middle management, meanwhile most leaders of the top companies are white males). The leaders are the ones with the power, middle management may have wealth but do not affect major decision making in these companies. I have been in this situation in my life and seen it with my own eyes. 

OK so now you have minorities hypothetically pulled up and now have wealth and financial stability. Lets say they try to push their luck in a protest against something against the norm, for example BDS protest or OWS. In the protest, you have multiple poor and middle class white people and rich nonwhite people. None of that stuff JP Morgan chase did will help protect people from getting targeted by the police for stricter punishment, being framed for doing more harsher things in the protests than they really did, being targeted on social media, their family who may not be as rich being targeted and more easily losing their status at JP Morgan chase compared to a white person losing their job. As a result of this systemic discrimination? Nonwhites are more likely not to speak out or push against the grain because they can lose what they have much easier than a white person: the chilling effect caused by this systemic discrimination.

Another example, lets say that same successful JP Morgan executive gets pulled over on the drive to a holiday dinner, would the cop be more likely to react negatively at a agitated suspect if they were poor white or if they were nonwhite but rich. It depends on the circumstances but I'd argue(and you study somewhat confirms this) that the nonwhite person is more likely to have a negative result. There lies another chilling effect that was displayed in the video I sent you. The brilliant of that bit shows the systemic inequality in a comical manner Will Smith's character displayed a chilling effect in that he never challenges a officer meanwhile Carlton's displayed the inherent freedom that all white people have with their white privileged. 

>What may well happen in the US, if current trends continue, is that poor whites will end up at the bottom of society.

It's funny you mention OWS, because identity politics is one of the reasons it fell apart.   A bunch of rich kids showed up and started demanding that non-white people be given preferential treatment.   They literally told white men to go to the ""back of the line.""   Needless to say, class did not factor into their ""stack of oppression"" -- even though it is *by far* the most important indicator of such.  


This is the essence of identity politics: not equality, but creating new social dominance hierarchies and new forms of discrimination and persecution.   It's essentially a mirror image of the eugenics movement, except the white male is at the bottom instead of the top.  

The broader point here that you seem to be missing is that the problems you claim to care about can only be solved by equal treatment and universalist solutions.   For example, studies have found that unions reduce racism (because everyone is treated equally, and they are working together for a common goal); conversely, forcing people to sit through lectures about ""critical race theory"" actually *increases* racial hostility.   It's clear why the billionaire class so avidly supports identity politics.

How does this fix a systemic issue in government? Furthermore, if we are going to discuss solutions to the problem you need to concede that there is a systemic problem to begin with and actually acknowledge that you understand the point I am trying to make. You have not done this, instead providing studies that do not address the argument I was making and then moving to tangentially related topics while ignoring my main point. 

I am not a proponent of identity politics nor am I a proponent of forced sitting through any sort of ""critical race theory"" lectures yet you seem to lack the reading comprehension to understand this in our multiple comments back and forth.

Obama brings readers inside the Oval Office and the White House Situation Room, and to Moscow, Cairo, Beijing, and points beyond. We are privy to his thoughts as he assembles his cabinet, wrestles with a global financial crisis, takes the measure of Vladimir Putin, overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to secure passage of the Affordable Care Act, clashes with generals about U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, tackles Wall Street reform, responds to the devastating Deepwater Horizon blowout, and authorizes Operation Neptune’s Spear, which leads to the death of Osama bin Laden.A Promised Land is extraordinarily intimate and introspective—the story of one man’s bet with history, the faith of a community organizer tested on the world stage. Obama is candid about the balancing act of running for office as a Black American, bearing the expectations of a generation buoyed by messages of “hope and change,” and meeting the moral challenges of high-stakes decision-making. He is frank about the forces that opposed him at home and abroad, open about how living in the White House affected his wife and daughters, and unafraid to reveal self-doubt and disappointment. Yet he never wavers from his belief that inside the great, ongoing American experiment, progress is always possible.This beautifully written and powerful book captures Barack Obama’s conviction that democracy is not a gift from on high but something founded on empathy and common understanding and built together, day by day."

I think a large part of the problem is that, especially on the Left in America, the Iraqi conflict is widely seen as illegitimate now. If our reasoning for going in to begin with was flawed, then there's no appetite domestically for reigniting tensions and increasing conflict.

I don't think you want to tout this policy as an achievement. *At best* the programme was ineffective at stimulating the economy and reducing emissions. Here's the conclusion of an analysis published by [Brookings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookings_Institution).

>The primary motivation for the CARS program was to provide temporary stimulus to counter
the economic contraction that was occurring at that time, while also reducing fuel consumption
and thus emissions. The evidence suggests that the program did indeed incentivize the sale of
more fuel efficient vehicles by pulling sales forward from the near-term future. This resulted in a
small and short-lived increase in production, GDP, and job creation. However, the implied cost
per job created was much higher than alternative fiscal stimulus policies. Further, these small
stimulus effects do not account for the depletion of the capital stock that resulted from the
destruction of used vehicles.

>The CARS program was not means-tested, and evidence from the consumer expenditure survey
suggests that participants’ income is higher than consumers who purchased a new or used
vehicle, but lower than consumers who purchased a new vehicle outside of the CARS program
over the same time period. Consumers who participated in the CARS program did not decrease
other measures of consumption to do so.

>The CARS program led to a slight improvement in fuel economy and some reduction in carbon
emissions. The cost per ton of carbon dioxide reduced from the program suggests that the
program was not a cost-effective way to reduce emissions, although was more cost effective than
some other environmental policies, such as the tax subsidy for electric vehicles or the tax credit
for ethanol.

5789,2020-12-14 16:41:12,kco8do,"One more thing to comment on is the nature of the Senate. Because each state gets two Senators, and smaller states tend to be conservative, that means to win a supermajority in Congress Democratic Senators have to be pretty conservative to win in states like Virginia, North  Carolina, and Ohio.

These are states where conservatives outnumber liberals almost 2 to 1 (40% average to 21%). 

Hell, even just to get a simple majority they have to win in states like Oklahoma, Arizona, and Kansas (where conservatives lead 39% to 23%). 

People have this notion that a Democrat is a Democrat and a Republican is a Republican. But a winning Democrat in one of those states might be more conservative than Republican in more liberal states. Sure, things have gotten more polarized and parties are increasingly voting in lockstep, but that's just making it more difficult for Democrats to win in more conservative states."

Our ""super majority"" was also contingent on the cooperation of an absolutely butthurt husk of a former Democratic Senator by the name of Joe Lieberman, who lost his primary to a more progressive challenger, then went on to win reelection running as an Independent.  He helped the Republicans hold the Public Option hostage even while the Democratic party *technically* and *on paper* had a super majority in the Senate, he wouldn't budge unless the public option was removed.  Almost all Democratic legislation had to overcome challenges like these, without a full super majority we couldn't accomplish any of our agenda.  
  
But, if you would like, we can split the difference and say that Democrats lost full control of the Federal Government on [January 3, 2011, when the 112th ""Tea Party"" Congress was sworn in with the biggest Republican win in decades.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112th_United_States_Congress)  That would mean that Democrats had control for about 712 days in the past twenty five years, or 24 months out of the past 300.  
  
380 days or 712 days in the scope of 9,000 doesn't amount to much of a difference, the principle remains the same: We haven't had a real chance to get real shit done in a real long ass time, and when we did have the chance it was fleeting and flighty."

But 100% electing judges is awful. The point of the judiciary is that it's unresponsive to momentary passions, which is part of what makes it frustrating, but is also why the Warren Court was able to expand rights so much. Having judges run for office, take contributions, and make rulings knowing they have to be re-elected puts a tremendous bias on our courts. If we want neutral arbiters of the law, we need appointed judges, preferably by a non-partisan commission (personally, I would love to give State Bar Associations the official authority to nominate judges for consideration to be appointed by Governors). As for the accountability of elections, I would be happy with a recall system.

Prior to the reform’s adoption , a filibuster would grind the Senate to a halt because the Senate could only have one motion pending on the floor at a time. Once the Senate adopted the “two-track system,” there could be multiple motions pending on the floor of the Senate at the same time.

It has proven to be a dual-edged sword. While it made it easier for the majority to maneuver the schedule, it also made it easier for the minority to sustain filibusters on specific motions indefinitely. No longer did the filibustering senators have to sacrifice their own priorities to maintain their filibuster, or face political blowback from preventing the Senate from moving on to other matters. By 1975, filibustering senators didn’t even need to actually hold the floor to enact a filibuster.

The “two-track system” and other reforms in the 1970s essentially removed all of the cost associated with filibusters. It is not surprising then that the usage of the filibuster has increased dramatically since then."

5858,2020-12-14 10:32:08,kco8do,"MaximumEffort433 already covered tgis, but to really dig into the detail

Obama was inaugurated to work with the freshly minted 111th Congress. It was well known that Republicans had already decided that they would be the party of ‘No’ and wouldn’t give an inch, no matter the issue or the policy ramifications for the country. http://content.time.com/…/s…/article/0,33009,2122776,00.html

But it did not matter, right? Because Obama had 60 votes! Well, no.

In the November 2008 elections which elected Obama, Democrats gained 8 seats, taking their total from 49 seats to 57 seats. https://en.wikipedia.org/…/United_States_Senate_elections,_…

There was also two independents elected who would caucus with the Dems: Lieberman and Sanders.

That’s 59 votes, not 60, (assuming you could get Ben Nelson and Bernie Sanders on the same page, which is no easy feat).

Also, that 59 includes Al Franken, who was not seated at the start of the 111th because of the recount and subsequent appeals in Minnesoate - https://en.wikipedia.org/…/United_States_Senate_election_in…

So, really, on the afternoon Obama was inaugurated, Dems had, at most, 58 votes.

And that only lasted a few hours. Sadly, during the celebration, already-ill Ted Kennedy had seizures and, during the following months, would only be available to vote sporadically. He went months without casting a single vote. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kennedy#Obama,_illness

On April 28, 2009, Arlen Specter became a Democrat. He openly admitted that he was doing this to avoid “the Pennsylvania Republican primary electorate” and would “continue [his] independent voting”. Apparently, Joe Biden also played a part in getting this done (well done, Joe!). https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/…/specter-will-run-as-…/

Still, Specter was certainly no liberal all of a sudden. For instance, even after the switch he openly opined that ""There's still time for the Minnesota courts to do justice and declare Norm Coleman the winner [over Al Franken],"" https://www.cbsnews.com/…/specter-i-hope-coleman-wins-in-m…/

Also, Kennedy was not the only Democratic Senator with health issues. Robert Byrd was in hospital from May 15 through to the end of June. https://www.denverpost.com/…/30/byrd-released-from-hospital/

So now, Dems have at best 59, if you can get Specter, Lieberman, Nelson, Sanders, and everyone else on the same page and Kennedy and Byrd could be somehow healthy enough to cast a vote, which they mostly were not.

And this is the summer of 2009. The summer of the Tea Party. Then a new phenomenon that had gained enormous amounts of steam and even more media attention. In the first half of the year had just spent the Independence Day rousing fear into every Democrat in anything but the bluest of states. The chasm between the party and someone like Nelson (who already only regularly voted against the party) only grew. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_protests…

On July 7, 2009, Al Franken was finally seated. https://www.politico.com/…/franken-sworn-in-as-us-senator-j… His election was close and recount was entirely called for, but the delay in seating him was entirely political, as recounted in his most recent book.

And that is 60, on paper. But in practice, Byrd and Kennedy were not voting.

Although no longer in hospital, Byrd did not return to the floor of the Senate until July 21, 2009. https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/…/byrd-returns-to-sena…/

The Senate was also busy with the pressing business of confirming Sotomayor, the first Dem SCOTUS nominee in 15 years, opposed by many on the right (Wise-Latina-Gate!) to the Senate. http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/07/us/politics/07confirm.html A vote that Kennedy missed altogether and Byrd attended in a wheelchair.

On August 25, 2009, Ted Kennedy passed away. Of a potential 270 votes in the first three-quarters of 2009, he was able to participate in just 9 of them. https://www.govtrack.us/congr…/members/edward_kennedy/300059

Even on an interim basis, Kennedy wasn’t replaced for a month, and not without a fight. Legislation was passed restoring the governor's power to make interim appointments to serve until the special election stipulated.On September 25, 2009, Paul Kirk was appointed to the seat, only after a Republican lawsuit seeking to block the appointment was thrown out. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_G._Kirk#U.S._Senate

So now you are back at 60. This includes Byrd, who missed more than half the votes during this window. https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/robert_byrd/300016.

January 20, 2010 - Scott Brown (R) was elected. Ending even any discussion of supermajority. Although he was not seated until February 4, 2010, Dems decided against cramming any significant legislation through before the new Senator could take his seat. You may recall this as it was discussed recently, as Republicans refused to do the same with Doug Jones.

Between September 25, 2009 and January 20, 2010, you have 117 days. Not senate in-session days. Total days. That was really the only time they had 60. And that 60 was contingent on getting every single vote: Dems, Independents, interim, infirm, Byrd, Bernie, and Nelson and every other Senator who knew voting with Obama meant sealing their electoral fate.

Edit: ugh the copy pasting of the links got fucked up along the way (this is something I wrote like two years ago and have copy pasted a few times), but you get the gist"
5859,2020-12-14 03:59:42,kco8do,"I actually linked an article in my post going into some detail about the Democrat's super majority, but here are some of the highlights:  
  
 1. The super majority was dependent on Joe Lieberman, an Independent who had an axe to grind with the Democratic party.  
 2. Al Franken's election was contested, so he wasn't able to come to the Senate to vote until later in his term.  
 3. Teddy Kennedy was dying from cancer, he was sick often, if I remember correctly he missed votes due to illness.  
 4. When Kennedy died Massachusetts saw fit to replace him with a Republican, Scott Brown.  
 5. Might as well say it, there is a lot of political diversity in the Democratic party, some are more conservative than others, and that sucks but that's the reality.  In a straight up or down vote we would have had universal health care in 2009, but for the filibuster.  
  
When Kennedy died that was the end of the super majority.  Having the VP, who is President of the Senate and tie breaker in Senate votes, wasn't enough to pass bills.  Having the butthurt Independent with an axe to grind wasn't enough to pass bills.  59 votes doesn't cut it, and that's all we had after Scott Brown was sworn in to replace Kennedy.  We lost the 60% majority necessary to get House legislation past the Republican filibuster and to the President's desk.  
  
You may not like that answer, but it's the political reality.  The only policy the Republican party knows today is obstruction and regression, and because of the rules of the Senate, once we lost our 60 votes, that was it, any legislation that wasn't written and passed by Republicans in the House wouldn't be passed in the Senate, that's how it's been since February 4th, 2010.  
  
You want universal health care, I want universal health care, Nancy Pelosi wants universal health care, and I bet if you gave Joe Manchin a couple of beers he would tell you that he wants universal health care, but Mitch McConnell doesn't want universal health care,  and until we either win another, even superer super majority, or win a solid majority and nuke the filibuster, those are just the mechanics of legislation in the American government.

* Preferential voting for all state and federal elections. No spoiler votes.
* Compulsory voting.
* All seats are redistributed via nonpartisan electoral commissions and the seats all have really nice names.
* We don't have party elections with the overall party membership, which ensure partisan radicals like Corbyn and Sanders can't rise to power.
* All states except Queensland are bicameral, and their voting systems enable third parties to dominate in the upper houses. This turns the Senate into a house of review, where bipartisanship is key. Also ensures (far better than anywhere else in the world) that legislations which are too radical aren't passed. Because the crossbench is so proportionally large, the Senate doesn't enter political gridlock and when legislations aren't passed the country immediately enters a double dissolution election which are rare and generally does a good job cleaning any messes.
* Australian Senate has more power than in most westminster systems with the ability to screw the government but not too heavily (only exception being in 1975, but that's because of John Kerr and being a constitutional monarchy).
* Because we adopted the Westminster system, there is a fusion of political power between the executive and legislature branch guaranteeing no gridlock.
* The most productive parliament in recent history was between 2010 to 2013, which was accomplished despite being under two Labor prime ministers a minority government with several regional MPs and loads of scandals, Labor did remarkably well on climate change among loads of other matters."

It actually led to outstanding social progress and prosperity, up until the end of ww2 saw the price of foodstuffs drop. Since then, there was tension as the working class (which had always been pretty active politically and had gotten such rights as an eight hour workday, safety regulations and a ban on child labor in 1915) started getting rowdy, especially after a certain Caribbean island went full Revolution- you never go full revolution (Yes, I’m referring to Cuba). Funnily enough, Ernesto Guevara- yes, ERNESTO FREAKING “CHE” GUEVARA- fresh off of having led an armed uprising in Cuba, stayed went to a conference on a Uruguayan Hotel where he told the Uruguayan workers that, with the strength of URUGUAYAN DEMOCRACY, armed revolution was unnecessary. Che Guevara, THE revolutionary, told the Uruguayans that their revolution could come through democracy. Anyway, a few years later, a bunch of college students and factory workers decided to try an armed guerrilla anyway. Then came the military dictatorship to hunt them down.
After the military dictatorship (which essentially disbanded itself due to external trade pressure after losing a vote to amend the constitution so as to make themselves legal) there was an ascendant new party, the “Broad Front”, which was essentially a leftist party formed in the wake of the dictatorship (like the Republicans of Spain that opposed Franco). During the 90s, they steadily grew as the main left-wing opposition party, while the other parties stayed center right (The national Party- based neoliberals) or moved to the center (The Red Party- yes, “the reds” as they get called here are the centrists). After a crisis in 2001-2002, the Broad front won the 2004 elections and ran the country mediocrely. If you ever watched [John Oliver’s piece on Tobacco](https://youtu.be/6UsHHOCH4q8), you will more or less understand what happened in Uruguay: bit harsher on business, bit laxer on drugs (one president of the broad front legalized pot) and overall lefty. In the 2019 elections, the candidate of the Neoliberal “National party”, son of the former president who had tried to privatize a state flight agency, got elected. 
The guy got confirmed as president on March the 1st, and the first Covid case got reported on March the 13th. By March the 14th, he’d called a sanitary emergency, called for the closure of schools and begun assembling a panel of experts to advice him on the crisis. And even amidst this crisis, he passed pro-business laws as well as reforms to immigration to make it easier for wealthy Argentinians (who are currently leaving their country) to become citizens; and ALL this whilst showing top-tier class, (imagine Obama, but white and explicitly going against socialists).

5919,2020-12-16 19:44:30,kco8do,"Okay I'm following you now

>Not enough to actually pass anything though i guess... unless they dont actually want to...

It is enough to pass some things, but with how the American system is set up you are right, it is quite literally not enough to pass a lot of things. You need 60 votes to get passed a filibuster. So yes literally *not enough to actually pass anything*.

Well, not quite. A bunch of stuff *did* pass the senate in 2009-10. A lot of was fairly run of the mill or just required 50 votes.  Big things though, like a public option or bigger economic relief or more drastic climate action, required 60 votes. Literally every single democrat in the senate supported a public option. The reason it didn't pass is because the independent Joe Lieberman who ran a successful third party campaign *beating the Democrat candidate*, and who had spoken at the RNC to endorse Joe McCain for President shot it down. The reason the ACA still passed is because literally every Democratic senator voted for it, *as well as* this independent Joe McCain supporting senator, *and* a former just-switched-parties Republican.

And so they were able to pass the biggest healthcare reform in 40 years by getting every Democrat on board *and* McCain supporting non-Democrats.

What exactly is your critique here? They literally didn't have enough votes for most of their pet issues. You can't just magic up more votes. The blocker was overwhelmingly the Republicans. Every single Republican opposed healthcare reform. Every single Republican opposed climate action. Every single Republican opposed more economic relief. And they had the votes to stop this."
5920,2020-12-16 22:48:01,kco8do,"What you're describing is why the democratic party ""reach across the aisle"" strategy, even taking it at face value and not as an excuse to keep from having to actually pass the things their base wants but the donor class doesnt, is self sabotage. 

Obama unnecessarily started from a weak compromise position and moved further to the right. He said from the beginning that getting rid of private healthcare wouldnt be on the table, republicans gave nothing in return. I'd he had actually swung for the fences he would have had something to give up in negotiations rather than a public option."
5921,2020-12-17 00:57:23,kco8do,"I dunno where this idea of negotiation comes from. Compromise doesn't come about by two people staking positions and then picking the middle point. It's about leverage. If a contractor is trying to negotiate a price with a business, it isn't as if the contractor says ""I'll do this work for a billion dollars"" and the company says ""we will pay $1"" and they settle on $500,000,000. That's not how it works in business and it's not how it works in government.

Democrats needed to flip Arlen Specter to get ACA passed. If the Democrats went to the left, it would make it increasingly unlikely that he would flip because it would increasingly alienate Arlen from his actual republican base of support.

Running to the left doesn't make Mitch McConnell scared for his seat in Kentucky, it means he can blast attack ads of scary socialists who want to kill Grandma with Death Panels to white suburbia. The further left the Democrats go, the *better* the position of many Republicans who can present themselves as the responsible reasonable leaders, and get backed by Fox News to do just that.

They don't give a shit about what Democrats ""give up"" in negotiations, it's about what *they* - the Republicans - actively *get for themselves*. Replacing Chuck Schumer with a member of the CPUSA doesn't mean Republican senators from Alabama or Mississippi need to suddenly concede more ground. If Alabamans and Mississippians get scared by the literal communists it means the Republicans can dig in even further.

If Obama had gone in guns blazing about getting rid of private insurance, he would have looked like an ineffective leader who completely failed in his negotiations. If he'd asked for the moon he wouldn't improve his negotiating position, just made himself look ludicrous.

And finally:

>reach across the aisle"" strategy

THEY DIDNT HAVE THE VOTES WITHOUT FLIPPING LITERAL REPUBLICANS. THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE. Christ, you need 60 votes. It's only possible by flipping a Republican. You *need* to reach across the aisle to get that seat. You *need* to placate that republican."

Things such as literacy tests and grandfather clauses would still be active in many states if given that sovereignty. As a classical liberal, I even believe that action from the federal government is sometimes necessary for the freedoms of all individuals."

A majority of the African-American population in the United States are populated within the southern states. I haven't seen evidence centering toward that the Southern states would have gravitated toward progressive movement unless you'd like to link some? It's honestly quite the opposite. Many Southern legislatures in the Senate, most notably Strom Thurmond, filibustered or just voted against the act all together. I fail to see that within the time period of late 60s to early 70s (so 10 years max.) that they would have pushed through these acts.

>and plus under Goldwater we would have never had the war on drugs, war on poverty, homosexuality wold have been decriminalized much sooner and america would have been a much more powerful, tolerant nation, wealthy and advanced nation.

Well pertaining to Wallace, in 1963, his segregation forever speech surely resonated with the audience. He also didn't change his views until the late 1970s. I would say the Federal bill progressed the South into its civil rights in much need. I just don't see the CRA being something that should've been postponed. If he supported it on a federal level, I would've 100% voted for him theoretically."

6038,2020-12-30 15:43:06,kn31o1,"I enjoyed some of the anecdotes of his childhood. However, the rest of the book was awful. It treats Appalachians as a homogeneous group, until it’s time to differentiate who is a hard worker and who is content to live off the government. He never truly comes to the terms with the fact that his success is largely the product of a lot of breaks going his way (having a grandparent with a separate house, for example). He insists that this book should not be viewed as anything other than a memoir, but injects his own half-assed social science theories frequently.

Two passages really jumped out at me: As a teenager, Vance worked at a grocery store. He feels a deep contempt for those around him, to the point that he’s criticizing poor people for talking on the phone at the grocery store. He’s disgusted with drug addicts buying steaks that he can’t afford. He suggests that HE is the one paying for the food poor people are eating. Though he claims to be less angry about this than he was when he was a teenager, I think he included this passage solely to resonate with the adults who are furious every time they see a poor person buying a non-necessity.

Towards the end of the book, Vance waxes poetic on why the poors buy their children Christmas gifts. He briefly acknowledges that as an adult, he now realizes many kids have it worse than he did (this doesn’t keep him from vilifying their parents for the last 200 pages). This is another moment of clarity that is quickly discarded. Poor people spend too much money on toys, while rich people give their kids useful gifts. I’m not sure what the significance of this is (though I also know that it’s not true). If poor people stopped spending $100 on useless gifts every year and exercised some self-discipline, they would end up with $1,800 by the time their child reaches adulthood? Per usual, he tells just enough of the trope to trigger the confirmation bias from his readers.

Appalachians don’t get many opportunities to be in the spotlight, but it feels like it’s almost always someone like Vance who tells the story. He’s not the first and he won’t be the last, but it would be nice to hear someone who didn’t grow up in the Cincinnati suburbs talk about Appalachia. If you’re looking for a non-venture-capitalist take on the subject, I would recommend What You’re Getting Wrong About Appalachia by Elizabeth Catte."
6039,2020-12-30 15:34:09,kn31o1,"I liked the biographical details, especially his depiction of Mamaw. She was one tough lady! But I agree about the bootstrappiness. He seemed to view poverty in Appalachia as mostly an individual responsibility issue instead of a systemic one. Since Vance doesn't seem to believe in government assistance (even though Mamaw's Social Security checks supported him financially), the primary solution he offers to Appalachian social problems is joining a local church. While church can provide a sense of community and emotional support, many churches in the South are small independent Protestant churches that don't have a centralized leadership network and can't provide adequate financial support to everyone who's in need. Because Vance received government assistance himself while denying its usefulness for others, I felt that he climbed the ladder and then pulled the rungs up for those who come behind him."
6040,2020-12-30 18:08:24,kn31o1,"> that smarmy college kid who always wants to debate everyone and jerk off to Ayn Rand

That's perfect. I found a lot of his anecdotes relatable (I grew up in a town not a lot different from what he describes), but I also was bothered by his attitude. If the book had been written as memoir rather than political polemic I would have enjoyed it a lot more, but maybe he wouldn't have the career he does.

To me he's the freshman college student going on and on about 'socially liberal but fiscally conservative' like he's the first one to come up with that idea. He's been lucky to have the life that he does, and been given the opportunities he has. So many people I know grew up without other support outside their households (as he did with his grandmother) and fell through the cracks. 

I feel like he's going to wind up winning office somewhere and pull off the scooby-doo-villain mask and we'll all see that he's just a member of the Ayn Rand Fan Club, or Tucker Carlson Jr."
6041,2020-12-30 18:26:18,kn31o1,"I found some of his beliefs too narrow sighted.

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
>/r/memes/about/rules
>
>r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

#Please do not message us about this, we need the minimum karma filter to prevent spam. Thank you
