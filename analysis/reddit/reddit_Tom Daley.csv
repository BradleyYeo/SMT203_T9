I think this is the best team.  The centermen are all HOF players, the defense has ~~three~~ **four** HOF'ers, the wingers are extremely strong (plus HOF'ers as well), and the goaltending is their weakest spot (but still have future HOF'ers Luongo/Lundqvist)."

60,2020-04-21 19:22:01,g5c61e,"I think the orgy scene was a red herring. I think we ought to be asking ""Why wasn't Bill fucking his own wife? Why was he out looking for some kind of strange and putting his life in danger in the process? (The hooker had AIDS)

The kids in the alley were fucking with him because he was alone. Then he goes after the promise of a wild orgy only to get busted and thrown out. He was never in any danger. His friend said so plain as day. The real danger was from the hooker with AIDS, which brings us back to the original question:

Why was this basically happily married man not fucking his super-hot wife? Why was the last line of the movie ""We need to go home and fuck?"" Think about it ppl. Alice was on her period, the studio decided to cut that part, ruining the main characters' motivation, and it killed Kubrick one way or another. 

They actually shot Kidman wiping herself on the toilet, ffs. If they had just left that part with the tampon in, ppl would say ""Oh yeah EWS was about a guy who wouldn't fuck his wife because she was on the rag, so he nearly kills himself trying to get laid"". Instead, they say it was about an unsatisfying elite orgy. No wonder Kubrick was pissed."
61,2020-04-21 15:33:01,g5c61e,"This is somehow the least conspiratorial theory I’ve seen surrounding a Kubrick film.

As for the film, it *needed* more editing. Shave about 40 minutes and you’ve got a fine film. As it stands, it’s bloated and inconsistent. I think anyone claiming Kubrick was done editing (not necessarily the party scenes, btw) is making excuses for the poor final result."

66,2020-04-22 13:43:53,g5c61e,"I figure that after his screening, they told him what they were going to cut out of the film and he either died because he was so upset, or they killed him because he threatened to reveal in interviews the missing footage. If they simply showed Alice unwrapping a new tampon or something like that, the entire movie would make sense. It would provide the motivation the film was severely lacking.

Re: the dubbing, I rewatched the movie and during that whole scene they were wearing masks so Kubrick could have made them say whatever he wanted them to say in post production"
67,2020-04-21 17:24:40,g5c61e,"Wait, you’re saying Stanley Kubrick was assassinated?"
68,2020-04-22 21:21:23,g5c61e,I'm curious what interviews you've seen with Kubrick expressing his disappointment.  He died before the movie's release..

71,2020-04-21 22:13:04,g5c61e,"I promise I do not mean this as snarky as it will come across, but if you have no evidence, than why do you think this? Why would those people that would want him dead then allow his movie to be released?"
72,2020-04-23 00:11:54,g5c61e,"The reason why I doubt this interview took place is because Kubrick would never release a film he's unhappy with.  It's no wonder why his movies are all classics.  He had full control over every aspect EWS, so for him to say something like that would be self-deprecating.

As an aside, I haven't been able to find ANY interviews with Kubrick."
73,2020-04-21 22:24:32,g5c61e,"Well in answer to your second question. If there is something in the film you don't want the public to see, you can't outright ban the film in a Western ""democracy"". Kubrick had too big a profile to outright ban one of his movies. Kubrick also had complete control over the final cut in his contract, the only way changes could be made without his blessing would have been if he were dead. 

To answer your first question, in short because i could go on, i believe there is evidence for an international child molestation ring. Kubrick was obsessed with unveiling power. The Shining directly mentions ""the jetsetter's"" and the final shot of that film shows a real photo no one can identify that has Benjamin Strong Jr, Woodrow Wilson in it. . .plus some anonymous guy giving the baphomet sigil. In Barry Lyndon ""the best people"" are mentioned during the period. I'm getting lost here.

Essentially i think he alluded to something too close to reality in EWS, and was killed so the films interpretation could be astroturfed."

75,2020-04-21 23:22:21,g5c61e,I guess I question the need to “silence” a 71 year-old man. The risk of exposure would far outweigh any gain derived. Occam’s Razor comes down hard on this one.
76,2020-04-23 19:32:18,g5c61e,"Stuff like this is fun to read and go down the rabbit hole, but, their premise is flawed.

>The scale of the 9/11 hoax was so immense it is extremely likely Kubrick's death was faked so that he could give the massive production his full attention. 

Kubrick was such a private person already (again, no interviews?) that staging his death for his ""full attention"" seems wildly illogical and unnecessary."
77,2020-04-21 23:31:51,g5c61e,"What exposure though? I'm not saying that this is the case with Kubrick, I think it but do not know. However, assassinations happen all the time that are never questioned. Even in obvious cases like Epsteins, the official cause is suicide, and that's still going to be the listed cause of his death fifty years from now."

81,2020-04-22 00:13:13,g5c61e,"Deaths get classified as suicides all the time even when the evidence suggests murder. Just off the top of my head i can give you three unrelated cases to look into: Danny Casolaro, Vince Foster, and Francis Nugan. Epstein is just one of many strange deaths that occur, surrounding scandals that implicate the higher ups of various institutions.

The movie Michael Clayton shows a very plausible method of how such assassinations could be carried out. Not to mention it was revealed to US Congress in '75 that the CIA has a heart attack gun. I'd be pretty surprised to learn that they never in fact used it."
82,2020-04-22 03:31:20,g5c61e,You seem like someone who has yet to discover that MLK's death was officially ruled a government conspiracy by high courts.  These things are 100% sanctioned.

And about Nate and Eve. AK helps Nate get out of jail and you’ll see what she does later... Eve on the other hand loved AK. Of course she was gonna take all her crap. Wes dying was a heartbreaking moment. Still it was not a deal breaker for me. But I’d recommend you should see the next seasons..."

>s3 got a bit too depressing for me what with all the Annalise staring into a vodka glass and crying in a dark room. I loved s1 and really liked s2 though

continue watching !!! although seasons 1-3 r the best, so much more happens later on. Plus if you feel the show got too dark in season 3 know its the darkest season. The other seasons r also pretty sad but season 3 was gut wrenching

>Viola Davis is a great actress but the role must have been so draining as she seems to constantly be stricken and weeping

Your right she's fucking amazing. GIVE HER ALL THE AWARDS

>Who else knew that Sam killed Lila from that first shot of him watching the news about her death through the whisky glass?

I did too, I just knew he wasn't the one who physically did it and the scene where it was revealed it was frank had me at the edge of my seat + its explained later on more in detail why frank did it (or at least I think I'm not sure if the explanation was season 3 or 4)

>I enjoyed the complexity of Bonnie and Frank and how their allegiance to Annalise is slowly explained

their relationship is so complex and my favorite in the show

>Why does every female character in s1, especially the lawyers and their clients, have identical taste in jewellery? This was unrealistic, the costume dept. should have given them different styles lol

-

I knew which year you were going to pick the moment I read the title. 


The director of scouting was working out of Mexico at the time. The truth of the matter is that the Oilers scouting was fantastic for about 4 or 5 years, and other than that they sucked. And things didn't really turn around until 2010. 


From 1988 to 2010, the Oilers drafted exactly *one* defender who could be considered an impact player. And then Genius Manager MacT challenged him to go UFA.

96,2020-04-02 21:13:15,ftu2d7,"Boy, the 1999-2001 drafts were bad, huh?"
97,2020-04-02 22:01:45,ftu2d7,Patrick White might be the worst first rounder ever. His peak was 3rd line centre for the Golden Gophers. Best thing he ever did was get traded for Erhoff.
98,2020-04-02 21:44:28,ftu2d7,I think the Avs 2010 draft deserves a mention that the Avs had a really good prospect in Hishon before garbage-heap Brayden McNabb headshotted him in the 2011 Memorial Cup. He was out for two seasons after that.
99,2020-04-02 20:48:02,ftu2d7,"You could say that 2009 was the worst draft for the Blues since they got David Rundblad.  But seeing as how they flipped him to Ottawa and used that pick to draft Tarasenko, I'd say it didn't turn out too bad.  The many Scott Stevens issues and draft picks it cost the Blues far outweigh any one single year in terms of prospect acquisition."
100,2020-04-02 20:49:28,ftu2d7,Ours is probably 2002 or 2007. 2014 was crap but no 1st rounder.
101,2020-04-03 00:32:42,ftu2d7,"What makes 2004 even worse for Columbus is that they had 4th overall, and traded it when they were on the clock.

The trade:

* Carolina gets #4

* Columbus gets #8 and #59

That’s all they got for falling back four spots.

Carolina drafted Andrew Ladd.

Columbus drafted Alexandre Picard and Kyle Wharton."
102,2020-04-03 05:41:00,ftu2d7,"The Rangers 03 draft was probably worse. I know you have it in the honorable mentions but 1999 wasn't a legendary draft.

'03 is arguably the greatest draft ever. And this is what the Rangers got out of it:

On the surface, we got good value for him, because he was traded for Ehrhoff, but because we weren't going to sign him, he was turned into a compensatory 2nd round pick.

It's a good thing Nonis traded so many picks in that draft, because he was pretty bad at doing anything with them."

128,2020-04-03 10:26:33,ftu2d7,Interesting read! Could you make the best draft of each franchise?
129,2020-04-03 11:10:33,ftu2d7,"If you look at it from a drafting *and* asset management lens, 03 was definitely the worst draft in Coyotes history. We traded our 1st that year to Philly for Daymond Langkow (a good depth piece), which turned into Jeff Carter. We also traded our 2nd as well, and didn't pick until we took Tyler Redenbach in the 3rd round. 

None of the players we drafted that year made the NHL. Absolutely loaded draft, and management screwed it up. A real black mark on a franchise that, for virtually its entire existence, has struggled with drafting, developing, and retaining talent.

Edit: And of course like a doofus, I missed this line: ""Important note is that I only took into account drafts in which the team had a first round pick."" The 03 draft still bears sharing, though.

And I'll take the opportunity to throw this in there as well; had we kept the pick and drafted Carter, I'm not entirely certain he would have turned into the star he is. I'm not certain we would have developed him properly."
130,2020-04-03 12:21:08,ftu2d7,"We're low-key one of the worst teams at drafting ever, and there's no way 2010 was our worst season. We got Pickard, who was an important part of the team for a couple years. Bournival played 100+ NHL games and Hishon may have been a bad pick but at least he was an NHL-calibre player before injuries ended his career.

I want to address this quote:

> Pretty much the only draft in which Colorado had a first round pick and still couldn't find any solid players

You make it sound like we don't miss first round picks, which is far from true. We just happened to get another ok player somewhere else in the draft every time we picked a bust in the first. Besides Hishon, there is Peter Ratchuk (32GP), Kevin Grimes (0GP), Mikhail Kuleshov (3GP), Vaclav Nedorost (99GP), Jonas Johansson (1GP), Duncan Siemens (20GP), Conner Bleackley (0GP). All first rounders by the Avs.

Other years that were worse than 2010:

- 2014: Our first rounder (Bleakley) was never signed and re-entered the draft where he was picked in the 5th. He's an ECHL player. The only guy in that draft who will play in the NHL is Lindholm, currently an AHL d-man who gets called up a handful of times per year.

- 2016: Jost may have 200+ games, but until this past trade deadline he was looking like a bust (especially for a top-10 pick). Jost still has a ways to go before he has the impact on this team that Pickard did, and every other pick in that draft was a miss.

- 2012: Only borderline NHL-er in this draft was Blandisi, who the Avs never even signed.

- 2008: No first rounder and Cam Gaunce in the 2nd is at least a great AHL player. No one in this draft has played a full season worth of NHL games.

So we had complete draft failures in 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016. 2018 is still too early to tell, but do you see a pattern here? For a decade+ we've just alternated between nothing drafts and top 10 picks. We also lucked out in years like 2011. It's hard to blow the 2nd overall pick (Landeskog), so that year doesn't look like a flop. But every other pick including Siemens at 11 overall was a massive bust."
131,2020-04-03 12:23:57,ftu2d7,All I can say is thank you for not mentioning trades. I hate it when people say a team's draft was terrible because they traded who they already picked and they went on to be a star for the other team.
132,2020-04-03 12:55:49,ftu2d7,I like how both teams that are listed as Winnipeg Jets had their worst drafts when they weren't the Winnipeg Jets.
133,2020-04-03 14:35:24,ftu2d7,"I get this defeats the purpose, but wouldn't STL's worst draft be the draft that Ralston-Purina said ""fuck this"" and literally decided not to send anyone? (1983, I think?)"
134,2020-04-03 15:37:17,ftu2d7,Honestly I think the 2014 draft was worse for the Avalanche. When your first round pick ends up re-entering the draft a couple years later that's a sign it was a bad draft. Plus they only had 1 guy even play games in the NHL.

139,2020-04-02 23:05:56,ftu2d7,"Im not going to disagree with the 2002 draft because none of those players played a game for the sharks. to me the 2013 draft was worse. Yes our first round pick has been successful in the NHL but i look at the draft capital in that draft vs 2003. More picks and higher picks, as well as trading 2 spots to acquire mueller and losing a 2nd rounder that year. Now Mueller was ranked high so i can see the reach but i recall mueller having injury concerns his draft year. At least some of the guys drafted in 2003 had talent to play in the NHL and Mike Morris suffered concussions in college(hard to blame the sharks on that one). Not to disagree with you pick but to me the pain of that draft wasnt as bad as the 2013 one."

147,2020-04-03 00:42:27,ftu2d7,"This is why I'm against drafting kids straight out of high school in the first 2 rounds. Yes, you can go back and find successes, but then you can find bums that never panned out like Mario Lucia, Patrick White, Zach Budish, Aaron Ness (yes he's still playing but isn't good), Tommy Cross, Will Weber, David Fischer, Carl Sneep and many more. Riley Tufte was drafted out of HS and hasn't done much and is a complete project.

Drafting kids that high that were in HS programs for their entire draft year is too much of a risk in my book. Of course plenty of CHL/Junior A/Europe guys can bust too, I just think they face much better competition in their draft years and are a bit more proven."

172,2020-04-03 18:41:16,ftu2d7,"'03 was basically blindly swing a stick and you're getting at the very least a serviceable player. You've got 12 players in the first round with over 1000 games played, 10 more with at least 600 (ranging from the low 600s to Braydon Coburn who should get 1000 soon.) If you drop it to 240 games, or ~3 seasons, you add another 5. 

Only 3 players drafted in the first round of 2003 played less than 200 games in the NHL: Marc Pouliot (22OA - Oilers) 192 GP, Shawn Belle (30OA - Blues) 30 GP, drafted by the Blues who played 20 and Hugh Jessiman (12OA - Rangers) 2 GP. 

In the second round, Bergeron, Corey Crawford, Shea Weber, Matt Carle, Loui Eriksson, Kevin Klein, Maxim Lapierre and Jimmy Howard all went on to have serviceable to great careers.

Even going up to the 7th round teams were still finding serviceable to great players like Byfuglien and Pavelski."

175,2020-04-03 02:01:46,ftu2d7,"Yeah, drafted too high. At least Carolina waited till round 3 to take Foegele.

Unpopular opinion but Mittelstadt was drafted too high solely cause he spent most of his draft year dominating peasants in HS and only 24 games in the USHL. He should have gone to Minnesota a year early, or played two years in the Dub against much better competition."

I mean if we had have had Regehr, we never would have had to trade Drury and Yelle for Derek Morris, or Tanguay for Leopold.

200,2020-04-23 23:43:53,g6w2vp,Does not look like Tom Daley.
201,2020-04-23 22:44:46,g6w2vp,He looks like a mischievous elf
202,2020-04-24 02:03:33,g6w2vp,"There is NO date, NO time or NO context!!  Is it actually Tom Daley?????

WTF??  WHO THE FUCK CARE??  ARE YOU THE GUY IN THE VIDEO?  NO?  THEN, I repeat....WHO THE FUCK CARES????

What is your agenda?"
203,2020-04-23 22:24:09,g6w2vp,"Cancelled? Is this twitter?

I hope his brands drop him, if he has any. Is 15 even legal in the UK? Hopefully he can get sued. Zero tolerance for this garbage."
204,2020-04-23 23:45:11,g6w2vp,When did a kiss become a sexual act?   Not everyone thinks that two males kissing is dirty or obscene.
205,2020-04-23 22:16:08,g6w2vp,Perez Hilton supposedly has it; I’m neutral until it’s existence is substantiated by a more reputable source.
206,2020-04-23 22:20:48,g6w2vp,https://mobile.twitter.com/wellimover/status/1253381328009076743
207,2020-04-24 02:52:23,g6w2vp,There was talk that he was 15 when the video was filmed. Dunno if that’s true.
208,2020-04-24 02:06:31,g6w2vp,Apparently twitter and Reddit. Keep in mind millions are at home and bored and will feed off the drama to entertain themselves
209,2020-04-23 22:42:12,g6w2vp,I was being a little tongue in cheek with the wording.
210,2020-04-23 22:43:25,g6w2vp,Also 16 is the age of consent.
211,2020-04-24 00:06:14,g6w2vp,"Two males kissing may not be, but a lot of people take issue with a man in his twenties kissing a boy that is underage on the lips."
212,2020-04-23 22:30:42,g6w2vp,I would be very slow to believe anything that Hilton claims
213,2020-04-23 22:20:56,g6w2vp,I linked it above
214,2020-04-23 23:08:30,g6w2vp,"I despise predatory behavior, trust me, but can I get some more context behind that video because I doubt the people in the background would be with it. And also fuck that cancellation shit just gon head and throw the book at him lmao"
215,2020-04-23 22:22:52,g6w2vp,"Damn that’s some hot tea.

But again we’ll wait until investigations are over."
216,2020-04-23 22:24:07,g6w2vp,"No tongue, prolonged kiss on the lips. Tom Brady did the same thing with his son and people just raised their eyebrows."
217,2020-04-24 03:08:21,g6w2vp,"He's 16, the only reason they're calling the guy ""underage"" is because it's Perez Hilton who released the video and he makes a living because stupid people thrive on fake controversy."
218,2020-04-24 00:15:33,g6w2vp,Well you may see something dirty but I disagree.
219,2020-04-23 23:10:22,g6w2vp,Context would be nice... but it’s gotta be something REALLY good to justify kissing a seemingly- intoxicated minor on the lips.
220,2020-04-23 22:36:00,g6w2vp,"are people really so delusional they'd compare kissing your own infant son and an unrelated drunk underaged boy?

Cancel him, sis"
221,2020-04-24 10:14:15,g6w2vp,"the video is from 2019, meaning the boy was 15.... so it's still predatory"
222,2020-04-24 00:22:59,g6w2vp,I noticed looking at it on Twitter the gay community is not popular when it comes to this issue. There’s a lot of talk that gay men are enablers and perpetuators of predatory behavior. Not just with this but in general.
223,2020-04-23 22:37:54,g6w2vp,Tom Brady’s son wasn’t an infant when that happened. He straight up had his 11 year old son give him a prolonged kiss while he was getting a massage. Here’s the link: https://youtu.be/EP_2NXe0_1g
224,2020-04-24 19:55:26,g6w2vp,"He was born July 19th, he'll be 17 this year."
225,2020-04-24 00:26:08,g6w2vp,Not everyone agrees.
226,2020-04-23 22:41:39,g6w2vp,"Difference is this isn’t Tom Daley’s son. Kissing your kid is one thing, kissing an intoxicated teenager is another."
227,2020-04-24 21:54:58,g6w2vp,"by the time you use the age of consent as justification, you already know it's predatory. A grown man should not be doing anything sexual with a teenager, more should he have a teenager drunk in his hotel. The man is married for christ sake."
228,2020-04-23 22:43:44,g6w2vp,I respectfully disagree. And I couldn’t care less about Tom Daley anyway.
229,2020-04-24 23:15:56,g6w2vp,"Oh no, an adult doing things you don't like with another adult while in a relationship with a third adult, let me find my pearls so I can clutch them with you..."
230,2020-04-23 23:00:06,g6w2vp,You think a man in his mid- twenties kissing a teenage boy on the lips is okay? Just trying to clarify.
231,2020-04-23 23:01:15,g6w2vp,You might want to find someone more interested in engaging in this debate. I’ve moved on to more interesting topics.
232,2020-04-23 23:02:46,g6w2vp,"I’m not looking to debate, I just more was looking for a yes or no answer."
233,2020-04-23 23:27:11,g6w2vp,Why would you bother posting in the first place then
234,2020-04-23 23:28:18,g6w2vp,I bring up Tom Brady every chance I can. That man is legendary.
235,2020-04-22 21:14:13,g69iod,I don’t know. it’s still weird for an adult going after a teenager. like they’re still children.................
236,2020-04-22 21:36:24,g69iod,"""even if it were true this does not fall into the category of pedophilia""

O\_O

Yes it does, you fucking retard."
237,2020-04-22 21:22:45,g69iod,that’s so sexist. i have been sexually taken advantage of by older men when i was 16. i was not prepared and i know a lot of people from the lgbtqia+ have encountered sexual abuse from older men when they were teen.
238,2020-04-22 21:14:15,g69iod,age of consent in UK is 16. and PH is a living piece of shit.
239,2020-04-22 21:20:49,g69iod,"Disgusting if true. Plus, we don't need a high profile perverted gay celebrity."
240,2020-04-22 21:45:22,g69iod,Just curious where you found this out? I couldn't see anything online myself.
241,2020-04-22 21:30:45,g69iod,"If it was legal, then not much to say. Well maybe ewww."
242,2020-04-22 21:38:45,g69iod,I would be very slow to believe this source. Personally I do not believe it.
243,2020-04-23 06:29:25,g69iod,https://youtu.be/jr45EkdGeUo here is the video he shows them kissimg but obviously bevauee the boy may not be a minor he csnt show the boys face and tom and his husband have paid the boy to get tje video so he cant show the whole video as it would be copyright and he could get sued.
244,2020-04-23 04:59:09,g69iod,"Meh.

- Perez Hilton still hasn't figured out why nobody likes him,
- Hilton is about as trustworthy as Donald Trump, 
- Tom Daley is, theoretically, an adult but he still looks like a fucking teenager,
- Sixteen is legal in the UK. 

tl;dr: there's nothing to see here."
245,2020-04-23 05:53:52,g69iod,"I don't care to debate the semantics about whether it's ""literally pedophilia"". The age of consent here in Britain is 16 yes, which is to accommodate teens that age having sex *with eachother.* An adult taking advantage of that technicality to also fuck a 16 year old, that would still be considered socially inappropriate by most British people. Technically legal yes, but still very frowned upon.

Secondly, I don't know what Perez' proof is but I'm skeptical of anything he says. Though I understand not wanting to publicly air a video of a 16 year old engaged in *any* kind of sexual act, we do need proof before jumping to anything. If it is true though I actually wouldn't be shocked, given Tom started dating his *significantly older husband* when he himself was a teenager (and Tom looked even younger than his age, to boot, so in my eyes his husband is ***extremely*** suspect.)."
246,2020-04-22 21:15:12,g69iod,"Even if he did do it it doesn't make him a pedophile. 15 is legal in a lot of places.

I think it's hilarious though that he married some old guy and now he's gone the total opposite way."
247,2020-04-22 21:20:20,g69iod,"I wouldn’t consider them children, they’re in that in- between place between childhood and adulthood. And while I wouldn’t encourage sexual contact with a 16 year old, he’d be close enough to adulthood that I wouldn’t really see it as something to get worked up over. Especially guys. I admit I would be more concerned if it was a 16 year old girl."
248,2020-04-23 03:00:16,g69iod,i think your choice of words is a bit barbaric and you sound dumb for using the r word but i agree on the pedophilia.
249,2020-04-23 06:19:23,g69iod,It would be ephebophilia not pedophilia..and he showed the video they did kiss and he may have been 15 at the time and drunk. It was a hotel party
250,2020-04-22 21:40:16,g69iod,"To be considered pedophilia the younger party has to be pre- pubescent. At 16, you are past that, so it does not fall under the legal definition."
251,2020-04-22 21:27:59,g69iod,"I admit I did have contact with an older man when I was a teen myself. It was entirely my choice and I knew what I was getting myself into. Now if this young gentleman was forced against his will, that would be an entirely different matter."
252,2020-04-22 21:27:19,g69iod,That doesn't mean that this  particular (alleged) relationship between 16yo and 25yo is abusive.
253,2020-04-22 21:22:13,g69iod,I want to see the video first. Just because I so do not trust Perez Hilton in the slightest.
254,2020-04-22 21:49:25,g69iod,Perez Hilton posted it on his twitter that he had the video of Daley making out with a 16 year old.
255,2020-04-22 21:41:00,g69iod,"Yeah, it coming from Perez makes it sketchy."
256,2020-04-23 14:18:55,g69iod,At what point is it? Because I’m not sitting through almost an hour of Perez talking. Lol.
257,2020-04-23 14:21:13,g69iod,"I don’t really get this pearl- clutching about that age gap. But that’s probably because there was a twenty year gap between my parents, so I’m used to it. But Tom and Lance we’re both adults when they started dating, both capable of making their own sexual choices."
258,2020-04-22 21:21:32,g69iod,"“Some old guy.” The man’s in his 40s, not that old! Lol. My own parents had a twenty year age gap, so perhaps that’s why I’m not really fazed by such a thing."
259,2020-04-22 21:35:27,g69iod,Yikes....
260,2020-04-23 14:35:00,g69iod,All I can find was a still. And their lips weren’t even touching.
261,2020-04-22 21:57:13,g69iod,"Listen, you're prob a teenager yourself and don't think this is such a big deal. But there are certain things you just don't do when you're a grown adult, and one of them is disgusting things like this to a literal child. Bitch and moan all you want about law, it doesn't change the fact that this person allegedly did something fucking disgusting.

Is this seriously the hill you're prepared to die on? Defending some pervert you don't even know? Fuck off."
262,2020-04-22 21:50:24,g69iod,Ahh...thank you
263,2020-04-23 15:22:51,g69iod,"It's about 10 mins in I think. Hilton uses his phone to show two stills from what he says is the video of Daley kissing the boy. The first still is before the kiss. The second still is after. Hilton then times the kiss and says it lasts for four seconds.

There's no proof Daley and Black have 'bought' the video. It's something Hilton says they _might_ have done to explain why he doesn't want to get in legal trouble by showing the video.

Stills from the video now appear to be doing the rounds on twitter. 

I am aware I now know far too much about this situation."
264,2020-04-22 21:37:30,g69iod,[deleted]
265,2020-04-22 21:49:46,g69iod,What’s the problem?
266,2020-04-24 01:03:06,g69iod,That still is just before they kissed. Why you here defending this crap
267,2020-04-22 22:09:36,g69iod,"First off, I’m 29. Second, I’m just stating the law. It is by definition not pedophilia. Third, let’s not act like the younger party is a child. Finally, the only evidence is the word of a known liar and pervert himself."
268,2020-04-22 21:51:15,g69iod,"Not exactly a pile of evidence, eh?"
269,2020-04-23 15:29:20,g69iod,"So like... there was no proof they even kissed. Lol. That still isn’t a great look, but their lips aren’t even touching and we’re just supposed to go off Perez’s word that anything in between the stills even happened. I’m definitely reserving judgment on this one."
270,2020-04-22 21:38:31,g69iod,"It may not be for you, but the reality was they were both consenting adults."
271,2020-04-24 01:16:13,g69iod,I hadn’t seen the full video yet at that point
272,2020-04-22 22:20:41,g69iod,">First off, I’m 29.

I legit thought you were a teenager given your dumbass attitude, but the fact that you're being defensive at THAT age makes it even more disturbing..."
273,2020-04-22 22:08:21,g69iod,"Not really lol. I did notice that Hilton gave himself an easy way out of having to produce evidence though by saying that a) he wouldn't publish it but b) he'd speak to his lawyer about getting it to authorities. IOW, if the video never sees the light of day it's not that it doesn't exist it's 'the authorities' he sent it to or his lawyer who won't produce it. 

I think I'll wait for Daley's response."
274,2020-04-23 15:45:40,g69iod,I know but people are running with this already. Daley is now and will forever be a 'pedo' to many. The rumormill has no mercy.
275,2020-04-22 21:41:07,g69iod,[deleted]
276,2020-04-22 22:23:23,g69iod,Please tell me where I went wrong in my assertions.
277,2020-04-22 22:21:55,g69iod,All I did was state a legal definition in this particular thread.
278,2020-04-22 22:16:56,g69iod,I’d be surprised if he responds at all. A piece of “news” that is so small- scale you can’t even find it on Google. May not be very noteworthy for him.
279,2020-04-23 15:59:21,g69iod,"Which is interesting because even IF he kissed this boy, that doesn’t make him a pedo. It’s not like they had sex, it was a 4 second kiss. Which isn’t advisable with a 16 year old, still, but he would have to be 13 or under for it to be legally pedophilia."
280,2020-04-22 21:48:02,g69iod,Clearly they found something to bond over. I myself had some great convos (and good sex) with men in their 30s and 40s when I was that age.
281,2020-04-22 22:23:13,g69iod,"Okay, pedo."
282,2020-04-22 22:25:23,g69iod,I suppose if it starts getting picked up by tabloids Daley may have to. But I take the point  - it may just fizzle away if he doesn't give it anymore oxygen by talking about it.
283,2020-04-23 16:10:04,g69iod,"All sensible points. I've seen others make the same points in the twitterverse but be shouted down as 'defending a pervert'. It's mob rules now man. What's worse is I'm not sure 'the kiss"" has even been seen by anyone yet."
284,2020-04-22 21:54:28,g69iod,[deleted]
285,2020-04-22 22:24:36,g69iod,https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/pedophilia%3famp
286,2020-04-23 16:19:07,g69iod,All I’ve seen is that still where it looks like they’re about to kiss but their lips aren’t even touching. The captions make it sound like they’re making out. I’m like... are we looking at the same picture?
287,2020-04-22 21:57:40,g69iod,"It’s all based on a tweet from Perez Hilton claiming he has a video of the encounter. So sketchy, yes."
288,2020-04-23 16:30:12,g69iod,"Well that's the thing  - so many false conclusions can be drawn from one image without context. Did they actually kiss? We don't know. If they did, are we talking full on tongue action or a chaste brushing of lips?  Was it a joke-kiss done for the camera? What was even happening in the situation anyway? Is Daley friends with this guy? Is he a diving buddy? Why was it being filmed? Who filmed it? 

If it turns out this is all some horrible scenario and the kid was taken advantage of then, yes, people can get pissed off and I can be criticized as someone who didn't fully appreciate things. But we just don't know enough yet."
289,2020-04-23 18:43:17,g69iod,Here’s an actual video of the kiss in question: https://mobile.twitter.com/wellimover/status/1253381328009076743
290,2020-04-23 19:14:29,g69iod,Appreciate that thanks. I'm not really sure what to make of it yet.
291,2020-04-23 19:33:52,g69iod,"Would you find a kiss like this at all concerning? I’ve seen some comments that are concerned that both are shirtless and seemingly- drunk, along with the kiss."
292,2020-04-23 19:56:42,g69iod,"Well that was my first thought: the kid's drunk. Daley didn't look as drunk but did look uncomfortable. There was clearly some sort of party going on.

Whether he was uncomfortable because of the camera or because of the situation is difficult to say. See, my initial idea was that maybe he was uncomfortable because he was trying to deal nicely with a drunk kid who wouldn't leave him alone. I got the impression the person filming knew it was Tom Daley Superstar and was giggling over a famous person. The kid maybe was doing the same. The kiss may well have been the result of ""let's see what it's like to kiss Tom Daley!"" Because it didn't look like a kiss full of passion. And then the kid said ""I don't know I don't know"". 

But then I wondered,  am I being too charitable  here? Why was a 26 year old hanging out with drunk teenagers in the first place? If Daley was nicely trying to deal with clingy fan then why didn't he just leave?

So I don't think Daley's some predatory villan but I am questioning his judgement. I might actually just stop trying to work it out until there's a response from Daley or the kid themselves because at this point only a description of what happened and why from them will actually clarify anything.

Anyway, I appreciate you reading my thoughts as I try to work them out."
293,2020-04-23 20:05:01,g69iod,"And that they both have their shirts off has me wondering a little. Plus apparently while the boy is 16 now, he was 15 when this was filmed. So that makes it a little worse. At least 16 is the age of consent in the UK. I dunno... a strange situation."
294,2020-04-23 21:43:34,g69iod,I did some digging out of curiosity. The boy is Tyler Downs. He’s on the US Olympic diving team. Which would explain at least how they know each other.
295,2020-04-23 22:20:27,g69iod,Oh no. The worst is true isn't it.

333,2020-06-22 18:21:44,hdwd0u,"An interesting dilemma, but I think a redo is the only fair thing to do in this scenario. Plus, it ended up not mattering because he beat the 4th place finisher by nearly 30 points. But imagine had it been closer!"
334,2020-06-22 18:49:41,hdwd0u,I remember in 2016 one if the ceiling lights flickered during a dive and they got a redo.
335,2020-06-22 18:54:14,hdwd0u,"I think it was 100% fair. Flashes can disturb a diver in a ""normal"" dive such as an inward 3.5 or a back 3.5, so imagine having so many flashes go off in a dive such as the ""double double"", where he has to spot the exact moment to come out of the 2.5 twists and complete the second somersault.

Of course I think the decision would have been fair no matter what dive he was performing, and I'm actually quite sad when I read that he only got to re-dive because the Olympics were in his home country."
336,2020-06-22 19:07:07,hdwd0u,"The fact that it was a first dive is important, but I waver between how. If you side with the re-do then yeah it was the first dive in the Finals so the photogs went crazy but then because of redo toned it down for future rounds. If you don't side with the re-do you can say that Daley just wasn't in full swing of things yet."
337,2020-06-22 20:52:23,hdwd0u,"I was going to recommend you cover this on your last post.  Interesting situation, I remember watching live.  As you elude to here, it wasn't so much the re-dive, it was the circus around Daley.  The re-dive just upped that noise and the whole situation just seemed to be going over the top.  I'm glad Daley got a medal and he's been a great ambassador for the sport."
338,2020-06-23 01:36:03,hdwd0u,"It seems kinda wild to me that you can complain about distractions from photographers doing their job during a gold medal event at the Olympic Games. Like you weren’t prepared for cameras to be there? Its not like they were unruly or acting poorly. 

If you want to compete in peace and quiet, maybe don’t enter the biggest and most competitive event in the world."
339,2020-06-22 22:28:33,hdwd0u,Twitter rage in 2012 wowww can't believe it's been around so long already.
340,2020-06-23 05:26:16,hdwd0u,"> and even gymnastics events, and no one complains about it

Most gymnastics meets specifically ban all flash photography because it is considered dangerous to the gymnasts. I remember an NCAA gymnast got to redo her routine because of camera flash last season, and I think there have been other cases in NCAA. USAG does specifically say that camera flashes are not enough of a reason to request a redo.

I do think it's weird to ban all flash photos because it's ""too dangerous"" but apparently it's not bad enough to merit an inquiry? So I guess I'm on Tom Daley's side here."
341,2020-06-23 02:01:56,hdwd0u,"Nice write up, clear to follow too"
342,2020-06-23 02:18:22,hdwd0u,"As a person with eyes, I can say we needed to watch him dive again 👀"
343,2020-06-23 01:17:22,hdwd0u,"Absolutely. I’ve been trying to offer him a spot on my international sports media organization, but I haven’t been able to contact him 😔"
344,2020-06-22 22:57:27,hdwd0u,"Just a question: at figure skating competition all flash photography is banned since it's considered dangerous for it's ability to affect the vision of skaters. Is it not banned in diving? Like, couldn't it be disasterous if it affects the diver's ability enough that he comes out at a very wrong time and belly/back flops?"
345,2020-06-26 17:21:38,hdwd0u,Flash photography is explicitly banned in diving though so it probably wasn't the people 'doing their job' that caused it as that sounds like a good way to get your press pass revoked.
346,2020-06-23 01:15:07,hdwd0u,"It is banned, but people were flouting it, despite announcements asking them not to. I think Daley having to re-dive finally made spectators realise how serious it is, and why they’re being asked not to do it - I think some thought it was for broadcasting / copyright reasons (like when you’re at the theatre) rather than actual sporting reasons."
347,2020-07-28 19:47:50,h7dhyj,Missed Abby Wambach and Glennon Doyle?
348,2020-06-06 23:09:26,gy0xyq,"Haha! Maybe it's because some fem twinks look a lot like tomboys? 
My reaction to twinks is actually a lot different, though. When they're cute, I kind of just want to grab them under my wings and protect them from this cruel world."
349,2020-06-07 00:40:23,gy0xyq,"omg, i realized this happened to me too! except, these fake ""crushes"" (in the past i would try to force myself to be attracted to people i really wasn't) that i had on people weren't celebrities but they were actually some of the guy friends i had but they happened to be gay (found out later on)

i think the reason i thought i could see myself dating them was because i knew dead smack in the back of my head that they were unattainable (wouldn't be interested in me that way) i saw them in a different light in comparison to straight men i would say because they were much more accepting and carefree."
350,2020-06-06 23:13:16,gy0xyq,"haha maybe! i’ve never thought about it like that - always used to say i was “sooooo specific” with men but i could have a crush on any woman that walked earth, so i can defo see that!!"
351,2020-06-06 23:17:00,gy0xyq,"The other day, mum was watching The Voice UK and suddenly poked me. She wanted me to see the 'tomboy' going next. Turns out it was an adorable femboy twink. I loved seeing him and he had a beautiful voice. But thing is, mum actually saw him and was like: ""ooh, that looks like a lesbian! *pokes lesbian daughter*"""

The funny thing is, and you know this, I picked up that jacket and those boots because of you. I haven't really worn the boots too often because of my slimmer denim compared to your wider leg pants. pictures is style goals for me though."

514,2020-05-17 19:45:22,gl96xm,"Thanks for the time to write and share this great OP with us. Yeah, if he is addicted to social media and wants to protect the shoddy police work of MTSO - it sure smells of new york john and his passing ALTs!"
515,2020-05-18 22:05:26,gl96xm,"Excellent post, I think they are ever increasing number of individuals and groups who are hell bent in preserving wrongful convictions and will use all tactics to do so. It's millions of dollars at stake which means people get desperate and crazy."
516,2020-05-17 06:00:48,gl96xm,"There is major money at stake here.  Millions upon millions of dollars.  He seems like an opportunistic money driven individual who will play for the side that has the most to win.  

JMO

Interesting OP

ETA/ I think there is a huge issue of jealousy of KZ and her success (as mentioned)

I too also think MaM stole MIPs thunder and there is animosity bc of that.  

I also think there may be a guilter or two posting connected to Hale.  This OP is very revealing in that there are many reasons that the state of WI and others want SA to die in prison.  Truth and Justice (for TH even) be damned."
517,2020-05-17 11:56:51,gl96xm," I'd say the fact the ""documentary"" has not sold is because Hale is one of the producers. 

 Documentaries are expected to tell the truth based on the known facts. There are too many facts about the unethical conduct of Wisconsin LEO and prosecutors already known.

 Expecting an audience to believe Kratz, Fassbender, and others would tell the truth now is unrealistic. 

 I predict extremely low ratings of this documentary if it ever gets published."
518,2020-05-17 12:02:17,gl96xm,Very well written and researched! Thank you.
519,2020-05-29 11:59:44,gl96xm,"This is Great Topic. I do not feel at this time that anybody should be buying Convicting a Murder. It's Apparent the World has Zero Trust In Law Enforcement. Look at what's going on in MN. GF.Look what happened in Georgia AA. In New York the Karen that lied to 911 about a Black man Threatened her and her dog. Of course not All LE are Corrupt. But with these situations happening right now I don't feel we should be putting anything out there of Law Enforcement good or bad.. All the Guilters against Steven will Disagree with this. But stop and think if a Documentary defending Law Enforcement goes on Nation TV Hulu Netflix or whomever  You are gonna have a""MASS"" Problem. Because 2 Sheriff's Dept. 2 Prosecutors State Attorneys Judges Jurors Ect... Conducted a Murder Investigation that has shown Framing Planting Lying Deceiving Huge Corruption and then put out there law Enforcement are innocent in this. Not a good idea at All. Those Corrupted racist law enforcement has ruined for the good ones at this time. Don't say it can't happen. It's happening NOW. Steven Deserves a Fair HONEST TRIAL. WISCONSIN IS KNOWN TO BE CORRUPT AND DISGRACE DISHONEST Which also Started with Peg Lautenslauger in which her"" SON"" Is Wisconsin DOJ Josh Kaul. That apple didn't fall far from the tree. Just my Opinion. Thanks this was a Great Topic."
520,2020-05-22 11:57:26,gl96xm,That is one explosive set of revelations.  It was clear from the outset that this shower of nasties were never out to do any good.  Sounds like Hale and Kratz are cut from the same piece of cloth.
521,2020-05-19 04:30:56,gl96xm,[deleted]
522,2020-05-17 22:09:38,gl96xm,"  *This OP is very revealing in that there are many reasons that the state of WI and others want SA to die in prison. Truth and Justice (for TH even) be damned.*

  The Constitution doesn't guarantee justice for victims; however it does guarantee rights to the accused. Why does the State want SA to have no guaranteed rights, while TH has justice?

 Legitimate government doesn't work like that."
523,2020-05-19 20:38:20,gl96xm,">Chicago spent more than $113 million on police misconduct lawsuits in 2018

Jesus fucking christ. 

Like the Catholic church"
524,2020-05-19 09:39:52,gl96xm,As soon as someone on Twitter pointed out Hale's involvement and I read about what Murder In The Park was about and saw that KK had flashed an image of Porter in one of his videos it became even more apparent that Rech is a good friend of LE who has seen the money making potential in trying to spin documentaries back in favour of LE. He isn't particularly interested in whether or not he is being truthful.
525,2020-05-19 21:23:37,gl96xm,Dont forget - 500 million over 8 years. Paying for CAM is chump change if it can get juries to think cops aren't corrupt.
526,2020-05-19 15:49:28,gl96xm,Wouldn't it be great if that's how this whole thing came crashing down - because that dumb fuck Kratz cant stop trying to get attention.
527,2020-05-19 19:57:36,gl96xm,"Lol, cuz that hasn’t happened before. Anybody remember the meeting between Buting & Avery that was allegedly not recorded?

🤣🤣🤣"

Do what you will with that info

Side note: his workout videos on YouTube are actually great if you're stuck in quarentine"

534,2020-05-05 21:15:38,ge5now,Ill take a pass.  Tom Holland is the only British twink I need.
535,2020-05-05 23:14:57,ge5now,"Okay face, body meh, nothing to grab onto."
536,2020-05-05 22:41:11,ge5now,"Too young/young looking. I'm way more attracted to guys with an older, hairy look."
537,2020-05-05 20:42:20,ge5now,Bit annoying tbh.
538,2020-05-05 23:20:47,ge5now,"Great body, but the baby face kills it for me. Looks like a 13 year-old with the body of a 25 year-old.

Non-physically, seems pretty messy."

The likely trajectory : strange surgery/medical procedures, bizarre media statements or appearances, drug use or strange personal life that becomes media property, then early death. 

Its a well-worn path."
544,2020-05-05 23:01:27,ge5now,I came here to say this.
545,2020-05-06 12:41:30,ge5now,This.

547,2020-05-05 23:02:48,ge5now,"He's pretty fucking amazing, I agree."
548,2020-05-05 23:02:11,ge5now,"He isn't.  He's very specifically not into hairy guys, I saw in an interview once.  He made kind of a disgusted face when he saw someone with hairy abs."

550,2020-05-05 21:46:55,ge5now,"Agreed he has the head of a 12-year-old transplanted onto a fit 20-something's body and it's jarring to look at.

A lot of white men like that look though, so eh who's to question it I guess."

The generic white person look? I agree"
555,2020-05-06 00:21:17,ge5now,I definitely want to put my dick in that.
556,2020-05-05 22:24:34,ge5now,"Lol I guess, generic-attractive in the gay community at least.

I mean it would be fine if we were talking regular dudes who we'd actually date, but cmon for the ""fantasy"" celebrities we can have higher standards. I feel like gay men have it ass-backwards on that, we manstroke average basic as fuck celebrities and then get shallow as hell when it comes to dating real men. (speaking generally, Tom Daley isn't average in body type but still)"
557,2020-05-05 22:30:25,ge5now,"Most celebrities dont look great. Tom daley's body is nice but Id rather someone more lean muscular.

573,2020-08-19 16:08:08,icqe2u,Wait... Michael Cole came up with name 'Electric Chair'? I thought that name was around a lot longer than that...
574,2020-08-19 16:08:51,icqe2u,Reading the old Observer stuff really makes it obvious that Dave loved what WWE used to do back in the day.
575,2020-08-19 16:05:57,icqe2u,"Unfortunately we are reaching the point where Golden era gen wrestlers start dropping like flies. From Davey Boy, Perfect, Bossman, Crash, Bigelow, Awesome etc. etc. This time period reaaaaaallly bummed me out as a teen at the time. I couldn't believe so many guys were dying by like 42."
576,2020-08-19 16:49:23,icqe2u,"Jericho vs. Edge cage match was a 4-star barnburner. They pushed new people, and the show ended with Mysterio, Edge, and John Cena in the ring and the commentators pushed those 3 hard as the future of Smackdown.

Crazy that these three really do end up being a big part of the future of the WWE. It's funny in the 2018 Royal Rumble Mysterio and Cena represent the old guard when they do a new vs old stare down with the final 6 competitors."
577,2020-08-19 16:12:01,icqe2u,">Hassman allegedly told TNA that they had gotten 17,000 buys from DirecTV but they later found out the real number was less than 5,000. TNA is claiming Hassman forged an email attachment on DirecTV letterhead and even forged a signature with these fake DirecTV numbers. They're claiming he did a similar forgery with the InDemand PPV numbers as well. Hassman claimed the total PPV buys for TNA's first show were around 74,000 which was great news. But when Meltzer and other media outlets began digging around and reported the number as lower, TNA responded basically claiming that everyone else was lying and that the numbers really were that good. But now they're finding out the hard way that they were wrong. For what it's worth, TNA's deal with InDemand requires the company to air 13 weeks of programming before they will receive any of their PPV money. So if the company was to fold right now, they won't ever see a penny from the last 5-6 weeks of PPVs. And also, if they fold before the first year, they will have to pay InDemand a steep penalty. Jarrett admitted that TNA is currently in survival mode and just trying to make it from week-to-week right now while they sort out this mess. The lawsuit against the firm is asking for compensation for damages based on lost revenue as well as punitive damages for fraud and sabotage. Plus they want Hassman to re-pay the $50,000 fee he received when he and his firm were hired.

And this right here is why absolutely, TNA was on track to go out of business after just 13 weeks until Panda Energy stepped in. Dixie might have been a money mark, but she saved that company and is the only reason it became the immortal cockroach of professional wrestling.


>(this just made me wonder, are there any other moves in wrestling that we've seen people do but doesn't have a known name?)

Old School didn't have a name until the Biker Taker era. That's one similar case I can think of."
578,2020-08-19 18:44:16,icqe2u,"[FYI, Jerry Jarrett has a near day-to-day diary book on the birth of TNA and all this craziness about its startup.](https://www.amazon.com/Story-Development-NWATNA-Pay-View/dp/1412028787/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1PB9OCFC7DDTJ&dchild=1&keywords=jerry+jarrett+book&qid=1597862607&sprefix=jerry+jarre%2Caps%2C151&sr=8-3)"
579,2020-08-19 16:09:01,icqe2u,"Internet is up and running at my place (and I also have a new job, which has been an adjustment to figuring out pacing), but tomorrow is on schedule for 1988.

Congrats on the job, brother."
580,2020-08-19 18:30:00,icqe2u,"Can you imagine how earth shattering huge Kurt Angle winning the gold in 2004 would have been? WWE would have paused the pushes of Cena, Batista and Orton to milk the shit out of that.

> He has been working indies in Michigan ever since until TNA came calling (he eventually makes it to ECW....sorta).

Its weird a guy like Brown slipped under the radar like that. Played in the Superbowl and a great look would be things that you think would stand out. The fact that he was awesome on the mic and intense in the ring(without hurting people) made him a godsend to TNA. Its a shame they wasted him."
581,2020-08-19 17:21:01,icqe2u,"Outside of Shawn getting his ass kicked backstage in a mystery angle I don't remember anything about that RAW. But I have no doubt Benoit/RVD was a great match.

But I do remember Smackdown:

>Notes from Smackdown: excellent show. Jericho vs. Edge cage match was a 4-star barnburner.

This is a low-key, underrated cage match. Everyone should watch.

>They pushed new people, and the show ended with Mysterio, Edge, and John Cena in the ring and the commentators pushed those 3 hard as the future of Smackdown.

And those three would almost be the de facto focal point for the entire Heyman run.

>Mysterio got a new entrance where he comes out from under the stage and got a huge pop and Dave likes that the presentation for him is so strong because that goes a long way towards getting people over.

Shame that Mysterio's knees are too bad even now to warrant this kind of entrance again. Dave is right that it REALLY made you think he was an awesome character cause no one had an entrance like that."
582,2020-08-19 16:34:30,icqe2u,"I've read about Douglas and Francine having a falling out before, but does anybody know exactly what happened to make them despise each other so much?"
583,2020-08-19 22:22:42,icqe2u,"Oh god, next week’s TNA show is gonna be the one where Puppet the Midget pulls a gun on Jeff Jarrett in the middle of the ring, and Jarrett just whacks him with a chair to stop him from killing someone."
584,2020-08-19 16:41:24,icqe2u,"> For what it's worth, TNA's deal with InDemand requires the company to air 13 weeks of programming before they will receive any of their PPV money. So if the company was to fold right now, they won't ever see a penny from the last 5-6 weeks of PPVs. And also, if they fold before the first year, they will have to pay InDemand a steep penalty.

Jeez, I didn't realize how scummy PPV providers were (or at least to people trying to break into the market)"
585,2020-08-19 17:04:00,icqe2u,"> Dave calls him the Japanese Goldberg. Huge huge HUGE TV ratings draw, big mainstream name, and has headlined some big Tokyo Dome shows.  
  
I only knew Ogawa as the guy that beat Hashimoto, but I didn't know he was a real draw. That whole debacle makes a LITTLE more sense now knowing it at least lead to some kind of tangible success."
586,2020-08-19 16:18:27,icqe2u,Crazy how much the business has changed that when TNA was starting up they were moving all this money around and hiring carries for 50K and a few years later shows like ROH and CZW were doing similar shows for much cheaper and in the modern day a IPPV that looks good with big names and a larger audience than NWA TNA can be done for less than 10K.
587,2020-08-19 16:30:14,icqe2u,"I think WWE over hypes how important DX invading Nitro, but I feel at the same time people like Dave underplay it. I wasn't even watching wrestling back then but I knew DX invaded WCW and kids at my school were losing their minds because of it."
588,2020-08-19 16:16:39,icqe2u,"Imagine if Samoa Joe ever won KotR, he'd start going by King Joe."
589,2020-08-19 19:32:05,icqe2u,"Congrats on the new job and re possible erratic schedule issues, dont worry abt it. The basic fact of the 2002 Rewinds means people will be more than accommodating on that front."
590,2020-08-19 19:17:27,icqe2u,This makes waking up on Wednesdays fun
591,2020-08-19 19:29:37,icqe2u,"2002 saw the rise of the smackdown six and ROH. WWE was putting great matches on, just a great year.
That 4 way Ironman match is fucking amazing"
592,2020-08-19 20:20:53,icqe2u,">And Shamrock vs. Sabu for the NWA title in a ladder match was a mess that was supposed to end with Sabu passing out in a submission and then Shamrock would go get the belt. That ended up not happening and Sabu never did the pass out sell and Shamrock had to somewhat improvise the finish of the match and it looked awkward as hell on TV. As a result, there's a pretty good chance Sabu won't be brought back because they blamed him for screwing it up.

Yep. This was Sabu's last match in NWA-TNA until May 7, 2003."
593,2020-08-20 04:18:34,icqe2u,I still think Monty Brown was one of the biggest missed opportunities there was and nothing will ever change my mind about that.
594,2020-08-21 01:38:02,icqe2u,"Rey Mysterio joining WWE began the golden era of Smackdown in my opinion. From this point on, for maybe the next 4-5 months, every Smackdown match as a great match. It's usually some variation of Edge, Rey Mysterio, Chris Benoit, Kurt Angle, Eddie or Chavo Guerrero. It was a great time for great wrestling."
595,2020-08-21 07:01:18,icqe2u,">The big question for TNA right now is whether they have enough money to survive the near future, and if so, for how long

And here we are..."
596,2020-08-27 07:09:34,icqe2u,"Dave is a little mistaken on Michael Cole here; the name ""electric chair drop"" pre-dates his usage of it here, as it appeared in the N64 videos games WWF WrestleMania 2000 and WWF No Mercy under that name. Those games' move sets were heavily based on Japanese wrestling, so perhaps the origin of the name lies there (or perhaps the developers just made it up). Anyway, as always, awesome job, and thanks again. You're making quarantine life a little more bearable!"
597,2020-08-19 16:28:39,icqe2u,">You know the move where a guy is sitting on your shoulders and you drop him down backwards? That move has been around for 20 years and Dave says he's never heard a name for it, but on this show, Michael Cole called it the electric chair. Dave hereby credits Cole for finally naming that move (this just made me wonder, are there any other moves in wrestling that we've seen people do but doesn't have a known name?)


This is kinda surprising because the electric chair set up is fairly common for big finishers, so for example the 'normal' name for a Japanese Ocean Cyclone Suplex is a bridging electric chair straightjacket suplex. In terms of unnamed moves I guess this is kind of marginal but since WWE unbanned destroyers (or at least the Code Red) I'm yet to see them very given an official name by the WWE, like, they're not called by a move name when Mysterio does them and Naomi tries them. Now I think about it I'm not sure what the 'official' name of the natural selection is either."
598,2020-08-20 04:16:23,icqe2u,I can't wait to read the details on how TNA manages to avoid going out of business. It's the most compelling stuff in the Observer Rewinds since the Monday night wars
599,2020-08-21 07:07:24,icqe2u,">Dave points out the obvious: Kurt Angle in the Olympics and going for the gold would draw huge ratings for the Olympics as millions of pro wrestling fans would be watching.

This is an interesting one in hindsight. Kind of sad to think how far pro wrestling has fallen."
600,2020-08-25 06:49:41,icqe2u,"> **Jim Cornette's mother Thelma passed away this week after battling cancer**.  Dave tells the story of how Cornette's mom used to take him to the  wrestling shows when he was still a kid where he'd write the programs  and shoot photos for the magazines, which is how he got into the  business. And from there, Cornette turned his mom into part of his  gimmick of being a spoiled brat raised by his rich mama. 

Damn."
601,2020-08-26 13:00:10,icqe2u,Congrats on the new job!
602,2021-01-17 19:38:42,icqe2u,I always thought the Electric Chair was the opponent on the person's shoulders and instead of falling backwards the person turns it into a type of face buster type manoeuvre. Guess I was wrong.
603,2020-08-19 22:33:42,icqe2u,[deleted]
604,2020-08-19 23:22:02,icqe2u,Thank you so much for your rewinds! I am enjoying reading them and learning more about what was going on behind the scenes back then.
605,2020-08-20 03:54:17,icqe2u,"First off, congrats on the job man. Secondly Jun Akiyama not being in the WON Hall Of Fame is a crime, the man saved AJPW. Never knew Micheal Cole names the Electric Chair. Props to Arquette to being humble about it and actually trying to redeem himself for it almost 20 years later. And by god next Wednesday we are in for a treat with Messiah."
606,2020-08-19 20:20:23,icqe2u,">Triple H is working backstage as an agent, helping guys put together matches (not sure if that was ever an official role, I'm sure Bruce Prichard would say it wasn't and Dave Meltzer is wrong 99% of the time and makes up lies). 

Prichard is living rent free in your head"
607,2020-08-19 20:30:07,icqe2u,"The Rock was elected on the first ballot in 2007 with 86% of the vote - this was his first year of eligibility.

Kurt Angle was elected on the first ballot in 2004 with 60% of the vote - this was his first year of eligibility, too.

Triple H was elected in his 2nd year of eligibility (he had 59% of the vote in 2004 and 66% in 2005).

Jericho got in on his 6th year of eligibility in 2010. He wasn't close to the HOF until 2009.

Rey and Eddie both got in on their 4th tries in 2010 and 2006 respectively. Eddie only had 34% of the vote in 2005, but he got in with 69% of the vote in 2006.

RVD was dropped from the ballot in 2007 after receiving less than 10% of the vote.

Nagata was dropped from the ballot in 2003, but eventually got elected in 2018. La Parka was dropped from the ballot in 2004, but was eventually elected in 2018."
608,2020-08-19 18:53:25,icqe2u,"The WON HOF is weird in its selections.  Theres a ton of obscure old time, foreign, and behind the scenes people in it,  yet people like Hall & Nash, The Steiners and Hennig are left out."
609,2020-08-19 18:45:33,icqe2u,thats wild triple h and kurt were elected before the rock
610,2020-08-26 18:58:08,icqe2u,Akiyama not being in the HOF is a travesty
611,2020-08-19 16:30:55,icqe2u,Pretty sure it was named as such in the WWE N64 games Wrestlemania 2000 and No Mercy. So they had to get the name from somewhere.
612,2020-08-19 16:42:12,icqe2u,"I'm pretty sure it has been. In the CAW section of Wrestlemania 200 and No Mercy for N64 a very similar move is called the Electric Chair Drop. Those both came out pre-2002.

Edit: whoops someone already beat me to this."
613,2020-08-19 16:26:48,icqe2u,It was I believe
614,2020-08-20 00:43:37,icqe2u,Dave doesn't play the wrestling games and it shows
615,2020-08-19 21:33:08,icqe2u,"I swear I remember the name existiing somewhere in the '90s. I feel like there was an episode of WCW where a commentator botched calling the Legion of Doom's finisher, almost calling it a Doomsday Device and then quickly changing it to Electric Chair."
616,2020-08-19 16:15:35,icqe2u,"Yeah, people call him biased when he shits on them these days but, like....the product absolutely *sucks*. What's he supposed to do, pretend it doesn't?"
617,2020-08-19 19:36:42,icqe2u,"Yep as fellow teen during this time it was pretty brutal, and played a non zero part in driving me away from wrestling.

Abt ten years ago found this blog post: http://4thletter.net/2009/01/royal-rumble-week-day-5/

That five of the guys in the top pic were already gone even then really hit home."
618,2020-08-21 01:35:57,icqe2u,"I remember around this time, Roddy Piper shows up in TNA with that shirt with a list of like 40 wrestlers on it who died young."
619,2020-08-20 03:56:21,icqe2u,"Yeah, and I fear we’re in the second wave of that."
620,2020-08-19 17:23:12,icqe2u,"What makes that staredown so funny is that:

- Finn Balor was already a star outside of WWE and not a young guy

- Nakamura was a megastar in Japan and also not a young guy

- Definitely works for Roman but he was booked to lose"
621,2020-08-19 22:26:01,icqe2u,"This show right here is the moment Smackdown turned around and became the best show in wrestling for a good year and a half. Formation of the Smackdown Six, Triple H gone to Raw with Hogan soon to be out of the company until January, Brock’s continued ascendency to the world title, etc. It all started with this show and specifically that cage match."
622,2020-08-19 17:40:36,icqe2u,"I think Prichard or Bischoff talked about it on one of their podcasts.  That Jarrett got the first number, more than 70,000 buys, and believed he had a found a workable model.  When it turned out to be a lie, and there really only a few thousand, they were screwed and weren't making anything close to what they needed.  

I think TNA weekly PPVs were $10? If so, that means 5000 buys would be about $25,000 for them (and the rest the provider), which isn't enough to sustain a wrestling promotion.  Whereas, if you could pull 50,000 on an ongoing basis, that'd be $250,000 a week, and enough to cover most of the costs."
623,2020-08-19 22:41:16,icqe2u,"Technically naomi’s finisher is “she calls it the rear view” so we know what she calls it, but we don’t exactly know what it is"
624,2020-08-19 16:17:18,icqe2u,"Thanks man, you too! Glad to hear everything is getting back to normal for you."
625,2020-08-19 22:19:31,icqe2u,"Man, I just started a new job, and I took so many calls from Iowa that first week when your power was out. And a tiny lil bit of me was like...hope SaintRidley is doing ok. Glad to hear you are!"
626,2020-08-19 23:11:16,icqe2u,"Congrats on you being back, always great to hear from"
627,2020-08-20 18:21:53,icqe2u,I've been watching TNA shows from the beginning. I'm up to May 2003. After these initial shows Monty Brown disappears and hasn't come back yet almost a year later. I'm really curious to see when he'll pop up again as I remember loving his stuff when I started watching TNA around '04
628,2020-08-19 18:53:02,icqe2u,The Benoit/RVD match is indeed good
629,2020-08-19 18:53:08,icqe2u,The Benoit/RVD match is indeed good
630,2020-08-19 16:36:20,icqe2u,"Yeah, I was wondering too. We finally find out in a few weeks.

There was an incident back in the ECW days where Shane Douglas got sued by a fan because he allegedly spat on her and hit her. Douglas denied hitting her and said he only spat at her because she spat first and that the woman also tried to hit Francine. Something like that. I may have the details wrong, but that's the gist.

It turned into a big lawsuit and apparently Francine refused to testify on Shane's behalf or something, so he was upset at her over that."
631,2020-08-19 20:39:56,icqe2u,"They kinda were.

The original ECW ran into similar troubles with their PPV provider, In Demand, before ECW shut down in 2001.

In Demand owed ECW around $800,000 in early 2001 according to ECW's bankruptcy documents. In Demand thought that ECW was about to go under (which it was). So, instead of paying ECW the money they owed them, In Demand decided to keep the money and bet on the idea that ECW wouldn't be able to sue In Demand before ECW went bankrupt."
632,2020-08-19 21:52:16,icqe2u,"Yeah, a closer comparison is to modern Brock, it was bold booking that made a tonne of money but it led to diminishing returns."
633,2020-08-19 18:23:24,icqe2u,"As someone who was in the seventh grade in 1997, Dave really undersells how big and influential DX was, most likely because of his personal biases against HHH and HBK. It wasn't as huge as the NWO was, but it was still very, very popular. All the boys were talking about them, what stunt they just pulled off on Raw the night before, the crotch chops, the quotable sayings, the cool theme music. For teenage boys they were over in a huge way."
634,2020-08-19 17:23:06,icqe2u,King of Samoa Joe.
635,2020-08-20 00:58:18,icqe2u,you gotta be Joe King me
636,2020-08-19 19:48:42,icqe2u,Thanks man!
637,2020-08-21 16:54:03,icqe2u,think he was just a bit too old for it. definitely think if he would've been around in something like today he could've been huge
638,2020-08-26 14:01:54,icqe2u,"Thanks, I appreciate it!"
639,2020-08-19 22:35:39,icqe2u,"Appreciate it man, thanks!"
640,2020-08-20 05:06:30,icqe2u,Thanks man!
641,2020-08-19 20:48:18,icqe2u,Not even a little bit. I actually love his podcast. But by all means.
642,2020-08-20 02:34:37,icqe2u,There's a 141 2/3% chance you're taking that too seriously.
643,2020-08-19 23:38:35,icqe2u,fitting a joke account would be a clown
644,2020-08-19 21:33:52,icqe2u,"Not really, theres a tonne of inductees that were on the first ever ballot that were historically important but would never get the votes, but afterwards it's all based on voting from industry guys and Hall and Nash were never exceptional wrestlers and only made serious money in a two year period (sting had to wait ages to get in for this reason), same reasons extend to the Steiners and Perfect. Basically, the floor is Sting and Nakamura, to beat them you (broadly) need to make the same amount of money and be the same quality of worker"
645,2020-08-20 00:43:56,icqe2u,I think it's weird to have a Hall of Fame that inducts people who are still active in their sports.
646,2020-08-19 20:32:01,icqe2u,"The Rock wasn't eligible for the Observer HOF until 2007. He wasn't old enough (35 year old age minimum) until that year. Triple H and Angle both met the eligibility requirements in 2004 (Angle got in on the first ballot in 2004; Triple H got in on the second ballot in 2005).

Once The Rock was eligible, he was elected on the first ballot with 86% of the vote."
647,2020-08-20 19:46:15,icqe2u,"The Smackdown games on PS1 also. Some of the move names were lifted from Japan, so maybe that's a clue."
648,2020-08-19 21:49:40,icqe2u,It’s been great these last few months
649,2020-08-19 18:32:02,icqe2u,"Most of the guys that I see that fans want to push as the new guys arent really young. Like Nakamura, Balor, Owens are all almost 40."
650,2020-08-20 09:08:02,icqe2u,"I'd argue that just means its the rear view. If it's her move and she calls it that, that's the name"
651,2020-08-19 23:11:56,icqe2u,And keep up the great work for as long as you can. Best read during lunch
652,2020-08-19 23:17:06,icqe2u,"Yeah, I was lucky I didn't lose power, but I did lose internet for a couple days. Phone hotspot when the data network is clogged (not to mention one of the service towers nearby went down) is not reliable."
653,2020-08-20 22:51:00,icqe2u,They should've got D-Von.

655,2020-08-19 18:29:19,icqe2u,"I was a little bit younger than that, but everyone focused on DX. Until I got into wrestling, DX was the only thing I knew about because they were so over with teenage and I'd argue pre-teen boys. Never once did I hear about what Stone Cold or the Rock did on RAW, but DX was talked about often."
656,2020-08-19 23:46:01,icqe2u,"So accounts named after wrestling references are now joke accounts?

I guess I better hit the bricks, because I am a goofy"
657,2020-08-19 22:23:28,icqe2u,"Perfect is in my top 5 all time favorites, but his career just never have the heights needed to be in the WOR hall. He was an exceptional talent, but he never hit that level. Even in the yearly 2000s when I would mention him to wrestling people, most didn’t know who he was from his name. They would recognize a picture, but saying Mr Perfect or Curt Hennig got no reaction."
658,2020-08-19 20:38:19,icqe2u,ah that makes sense cheers
659,2020-08-20 21:01:32,icqe2u,I think if it were called Electric Chair in Japan Dave would have already give it 12 out of 5 stars! ;)

804,2020-10-25 04:03:25,jhcaig,Met him in real life and he is NOT gay. My gaydar is 100% accurate. Meanwhile I have also met other celebrities that were supposedly straight and they were gay as hell.

808,2020-10-25 00:42:47,jhcaig,Well K-pop stars are required by their labels not to be in relationships.  Or if they are in a relationship they cant announce it.  Its even more taboo since theyre a gay couple it would be even worse for them if they came out as a couple.  It was really bad for HyunA and Hyojong.  Many people thought they were dating for a long time.  Then they came out as a couple.  Their label was forced to confirmed the news.  Then their label basically kicked them out then suddenly retracted it.(their agents didnt even tell them...they just found out in the news).  It workd out though. Hyojong left the agency/group he was in and so did HyunA.  They signed with Psy's new recording company.  Hopefully he will treat them better.  Also theyre a straight couple.  I couldnt imagine the backlash if it were a gay couple.
809,2020-10-25 01:21:39,jhcaig,"Wait, Colton Haynes is gay? lol"
810,2020-10-25 00:36:11,jhcaig,"Yes it was. What I'm truly curious though is with how comfortable they were and grinding and making out etc. during filming, you think they got boners and just went with it..? Seriously. Even in male /female scenes; any actors or showbiz adjacent insif3 about this?"
811,2020-10-25 17:39:02,jhcaig,I prefer the STR8 ones forsome reason. But Im also into STR8 dudes.

817,2020-10-12 20:57:18,j9z6y3,The detail in this is amazing. This is a really good read!
818,2020-10-12 21:45:47,j9z6y3,"Great read, thank you for the reminder of 7 years of awful recruitment and planning"
819,2020-10-13 00:16:03,j9z6y3,We're becoming the New York Knicks of the Premier League.
820,2020-10-13 02:49:44,j9z6y3,">and in 2012 United lost young academy product Paul Pogba on a free transfer to Juventus. A decision some would argue as Ferguson’s biggest mistake.

If anything, he was proven right."
821,2020-10-12 22:09:12,j9z6y3,"Great read, It could use a bit of formatting but was a good round-up of the shitshow that was the past 7 years.

2 thing:

1. I suggest using transfermarkt (preferably in pounds as that is the currency most of these transfers were made in even though it did lose some value across the 7 year period) for the fees as some of the ones you wrote are a bit skewed. They may not be 100% correct but at least the information comes from the same place.
2. You forgot a point when you were talking about midfielders, during the 2013-2014 season David Moyes had talks and convinced Toni Kroos to join in the summer, but Louis van Gaal blocked the move and Kroos went on to sign with Madrid that summer for £22.50m."
822,2020-10-12 21:23:33,j9z6y3,"This could really use some formatting and a clearer timeline (Van Gaal selling Zaha and then saying Mata was bought in January, for example). 

Good post otherwise."
823,2020-10-12 22:18:58,j9z6y3,"> Unfortunately this left Sergio Romero out in the cold. The Argentine was not made aware of United’s plans for him until late in the transfer window.

This I just don't believe, didn't we say that Henderson was staying pretty early on?"
824,2020-10-13 06:33:33,j9z6y3,"There are so many similar patterns in this

Fabregas=Sancho

Diallo=Martial

Zlatan=Cavani

Rashford=Greenwood"
825,2020-10-12 21:19:27,j9z6y3,Paragraphs would make this actually legible
826,2020-10-13 03:24:17,j9z6y3,You forgot to mention that we were offered Harry Maguire for £17m in 2017 but it was rejected. Instead we paid £80m in 2019.
827,2020-10-13 06:55:18,j9z6y3,This reads like a well written horror story
828,2020-10-12 22:47:13,j9z6y3,"Very detailed overwiev, great Job! I think this really shows how inexperienced this team is, I believe we have a lot of young talent in the right spots, we just need some winners like Ibra, Rooney, Keane, Cantona to show these youngsters the way!

I believe we need to give Solskjær his shot at developing this squad, the players seem to be behind him for now. His handling of Haaland back in Molde, and Greenwood this season, he seems to be doing something right."
829,2020-10-12 21:30:53,j9z6y3,So you basically did the opposite of summarizing what's things have been like since 2013.
830,2020-10-13 06:13:49,j9z6y3,"And yet some people think, sacking Ole and hiring Poch/Nagelsman would magically change everything."

836,2020-10-13 10:49:17,j9z6y3,"> now United have four goalkeepers at the club totaling to nearly $500 k a week.

This is such a clear example of our incompetence. I still have no idea what actually was the point of signing Lee Grant, and Romero should have been shipped out the moment Henderson agreed to stay. Surely the club (and his agent) could have found him something somewhere for even a small fee? Everton on deadline day is not the first time we should be hearing about a move away for him.

> Unfortunately due to his high wages United have failed sell the Argentine for two years now as he has been left out of the squads Champions League Squad along with Phil Jones, who most bafflingly was offered a five-year contract in 2018. The injury prone defender is still on the medical table and couldn’t be shifted this summer as well. 

You'd think by now the incompetent cunts would realise they aren't recuperating the money from the deadwood so just let them fuck off on a free transfer."
837,2020-10-13 03:23:32,j9z6y3,"Thanks for writing this . 

Different managers and players but the board has been following the same pattern for years ."
838,2020-10-13 04:43:32,j9z6y3,"Very detailed read reminding us of the disarray we have been in since Fergie and Gill left and financiers started having the final say on footballing matters.

It's clear that the rot starts from the top, with nobody really having a clear strategy for the club. 

We haven't been backing our managers with long enough terms or the signings their team setup demanded. Worse even, we have been rotating managers with vastly differing philosophies necessitating a revamp in the playing style, lineup and signings every 2 years. 

Meanwhile Liverpool have embarked on a long term and clearly coherent plan to all aboard the payroll and beyond, resulting in delayed but highly successful results (to say the least!)

To see real change, only the departure of the Glazers would result in vast improvements with part ownership sold back to season ticket holders. How unlikely this all seems with how much money our beloved club are generating for the Glazers, and the vulture banks robbing us blind."
839,2020-10-13 07:44:46,j9z6y3,"Oh man such a well written post, I literally shook my head multiple times at some of the examples of incompetence given in the post."
840,2020-10-13 08:21:48,j9z6y3,Kudos for a 10-page long document. You put a lot of efforts in it.
841,2020-10-13 12:47:18,j9z6y3,"A brilliant write up, well done! The only thing I’d change is the currency. You’re using $ instead of £ for some reason, although I don’t think the conversion is accurate if that’s what you’ve tried to do. Cheers again mate. Enjoyed reading it"

844,2020-10-13 03:33:48,j9z6y3,"I strongly concur with this thing: Man Utd will regret, deeply regret if they can’t have Sancho. 

But it’s our traditional transfer strategy, right? Always choose the wrong ones. Always."
845,2020-10-13 08:41:36,j9z6y3,"Reading that CB list makes me sad. Maybe this is me getting nostalgic, but Wes Brown was a better defender than all our current first team CBs. And Wes was not even our first choice.

Heck that one year @ RB, Wes was probably a better RB than Wan Bissaka, but after AGES of clamoring to replace GNev appropriately, AWB is adequate (though not spectacular).

The less said about our current LBs the better. This is not really unprecedented, as we had a few years of suffering with mediocre LBs between Irwin and Evra. I hope that Telles can keep Shaw out of the first team for the next 3-4 years at least :/"

849,2020-10-13 03:51:56,j9z6y3,Sad but so true.
850,2020-10-13 14:35:30,j9z6y3,It’s worth noting that Pogba and Ravel Morrison were both touted as the future of the Utd midfield.
851,2020-10-13 04:26:52,j9z6y3,"I don’t think so, you never know what Pogba could’ve developed into if he stayed at the club and received a Rashford/Greenwood/McTominay level push into the first team. But of course Pogba grew impatient and didn’t wait for his chance at the club with the oh-so sweet agent nudging him over the line."
852,2020-10-13 13:50:25,j9z6y3,Pique would probably be another candidate but he was going to have to be second choice to Ferdinand and Vidic for a few more years so it's hard to be too disappointed despite his success at Barca.
853,2020-10-13 04:09:27,j9z6y3,That second point adds salt to the wound man
854,2020-10-13 06:33:31,j9z6y3,"And if the rumours were to be believed that he was frustrated after not playing in either of the semis, he should have found himself another club earlier in the window."
855,2020-10-13 02:51:51,j9z6y3,Wait he posted this without paragraphs initially? Holy shit
856,2020-10-13 05:10:49,j9z6y3,We also had a chance to sign him for 60m but didn’t.
857,2020-10-13 08:25:36,j9z6y3,"Would Poch/Nagelsman have signed off on players like Rojo and James though? 

Obviously Ole had nothing to do with Rojo being signed, but Van Gaal was clearly passed it as a club manager, something most experts knew, apart from Woodward obviously..."

863,2020-10-13 04:36:12,j9z6y3,"R/G/McT look to me like they want to be the best to wear the United shirt.

P looks to me like he wants to be the best he can be.

It's not a slight against him by any means, just a difference in motivation and hence why he chose to move to Juventus. It also doesn't mean that he doesn't love United, or that he's not professional, just that his priority is himself as a player rather than a player for United. Which is fair enough but unfortunate."
864,2020-10-13 06:15:17,j9z6y3,"He listened more to his agents than Fergie. Fergie didn't want him to sign Raiola as his agent but Pogba didn't listen.

The way I see it - If a player doesn't want to stay, its better to let him go.  No player should be bigger than the club.

Fergie was right about Pogba and still is."
865,2020-10-13 03:11:16,j9z6y3,"Yeah, it was originally one huge wall of text per position."
866,2020-10-13 07:32:29,j9z6y3,"I actually feel very sorry for our scouts. They spend years scouting, comparing, making detailed reports about players only for Matt Judge and Woodward to treat it like garbage and throw it in the bin."
867,2020-10-13 13:33:46,j9z6y3,"They might, well they might be forced to. For example, I am pretty sure Ole didn't want Cavani but was forced to say yes because of the lack of depth. Rojo and James were not panic buys but, LVG didn't get his first or second choice CBs. So, signing Rojo after a good world cup was not as bad a decision as it sounds right now. It's still too early to call James a bad signing. He was a pretty cheap buy anyways so, he is not going to hurt us massively even if he doesn't work out. Having said that, James has been wanted by Bielsa twice now. I fully trust Bielsa's choice, so if he wants him there is definitely something in him."
868,2020-10-13 04:39:20,j9z6y3,"I mostly agree with you, but I also believe football fans slightly underplay the importance of agents in such situations. Personalities like Mino Raiola can be incredibly convincing about “what’s best for the player”. We are actually blessed no such agent handles our other home-grown talent."
869,2020-10-13 10:10:54,j9z6y3,[deleted]
870,2020-10-13 04:50:23,j9z6y3,"Ya that's a fair take - I wonder if right now Pogba sees Raiola as a competent employee, or a trusted advisor. I suppose we'll never know but sure hopes he either turns up for us or honestly we're better off cashing in our chips before 2012 repeats itself."
871,2020-10-13 13:42:04,j9z6y3,"The only player that Fergie ever gave leeway to in that sense was Cantona. Even Keane was shipped out as soon as he became what SAF saw as a disruptive force.

Pogba can fuck right off."

good work, joe

879,2020-12-01 18:11:16,jzzl95,"I actually came across this post by looking something else up.  But thank you so much for sharing and your time and effort, this was clearly not an easy list to compile!  

Knights of Malta are a terrifying organization, and it's actually Sovereign (as in, it's recognized by the UN as its own ruling entity).  Donovan was a member and is also one of the extremely rare winners of one of the highest awards that only the Pope himself can give (Grand Cross of the Order of Sylvester).  

What becomes even stranger is when you examine World War 2 under a knights of Malta filter.  The Knights of Malta had a famous split when Napoleon kicked them out of Malta. One of the groups ended up in Russia and were upset that the 71st grandmaster had given up Malta so easily that they recognized Paul I (emperor of Russia at the time) as both protector and the 72nd Grandmaster of the order. Except...the Pope didn't give his blessing.  Paul I was assassinated and it's hard to find history on what happened to the regalia but we have proof of the order continuing to exist and even letters being written about it.  

There is a lot of back and forth, but what always has been on my mind is that St. Petersburg was famously robbed and most of the art and regalia from there was never found again.  I always wondered if some of the official regalia of the Knights of Malta was part of that.  

Also, 
I have a question, have you heard of the OSS Bill Donovan award?  Each of the award winners seem to be involved in a highly followed event every year. If some of those award winners are on these same lists, I'm sure it's worth noting."
880,2020-12-21 05:00:15,jzzl95,"I'm well aware. The fact of the matter is that there are a whole lot of Catholics that despise Francis and his last few years of announcements like the big bang is a fact, and that gay unions are okay. And of course Francis is the first Jesuit pope.

The entire Jesuit foundation is about globalization, social justice, open borders, etc and the real problem is that they have acquired the most money and weapons and armies in the world. From my perspective there's not many countries still battling against them anymore. They've been infiltrating governments for 500 years."

887,2020-11-24 13:11:13,jzzl95,"Thanks to the Vatican and Jesuits people question the notion of God, and most attribute anthropomorphization to it and that is an error. It is impossible to claim nonexistence of God when you know what it is. The term 'god' was a general word for a sovereign and was commonly attributed towards men who are rulers, and metaphorically applied to supernatural governing forces. Capitalizing it referrs to the said 'Supreme Being' as a verb. The proper word is Yehovah which translates to 'the Self-Existent', as a verb; that which exists without the agency of man. It is Reality in its self-existence. The Bible is metaphorical and allegorical not meant to be taken literally, and doing so leads to logical doubt, again, thanks to Rome."

889,2020-11-24 13:22:59,jzzl95,"My own personal beliefs come from many, many years of self reflecting, meditation, reading anything and everything (including the King James version of the bible in its entirety some years ago). I understand your view point and respect it, but for me personally I don't believe in any such God defined by religion. Whether I type god or God makes no difference to me at all in this conversation and whether it made a difference hundreds of years ago or whether men called other men god really doesn't matter to me and has no bearing on my life in the current frame.  Everything you say could be true, but it's also just a belief that you personally hold. So I respect it, I just happen to think that we live in a simulation, so under that notion, god / God / programmer / creator / is all the same thing to me. Some people think ""god"" would be just be all of existence, all of us combined, the universe, etc, and that's a fine belief, I used to believe that as well for a very long time and in situations where I was forced to pray I would in my brain just replace ""god"" with ""universe"" which made more sense to me. I just don't believe that anymore, but there is certainly merit in it."
890,2020-11-25 07:55:42,jzzl95,"This notion of Self-existence was before any religion, before biblical times. Its not a belief but more of a truthful observation of reality. I respect your outlook on life, but to say you don't subscribe to Yehovah/The Self-existent (after knowing what It is) is saying you don't believe in reality. Yehovah is not some being, it is reality/nature without the agency of men. 'Throwing the baby with the bath water' is what the Vatican and Jesuits have manipulated people to do with The Bible and the message of Christ. All Christ was really saying (in parables) was to 'keep it real' and to not adhere to artifice; don't try to overcome Nature. Churches are a fallacy and spread false teachings to keep people in adherence to artifice, to the vatican world empire of personhood. Meditation can be helpful, but its propagation and popularity is jesuitical from the new age movement. And i warn you, you are subscribing to humanism which is jesuitical as well."
891,2020-11-25 10:07:02,jzzl95,">Its not a belief but more of a truthful observation of reality.

To say that reality is actually ""god"" itself (or whatever word you want to ascribe to it) is still a belief because you cannot prove it.

>All Christ was really saying (in parables)

I don't believe that this christ character was ever a person, much less a person who ever said or wrote anything down. There is as much proof of Jesus' existence as there is batman's existence (and probably less).

My disbelief in any such god characters has literally nothing to do with jesuits or the vatican or religion itself. so whether they believe in fairy tales or not has no bearing on my life. 

My beef with the Jesuits has nothing to do with any kind of god character. It has only to do with exposing the fact that they are the current shadow government running the world. Whether their reasons for it revolve around god or satan is really of no concern to me."
892,2020-11-25 11:09:29,jzzl95,"Its not a belief. The term Yehovah means nature/reality in its self-existence. The term 'God' is metaphorically attributed to It, and essentially vulgar. No church will tell anyone this.

Back then people spoke and authors wrote in allegorical rhetoric (as opposed to later where language became literal). Speaking in allegory was to aid in understanding ideas. The Bible was written by wise men, not God or Christ. Christ in The Bible can be attributed to other earlier prophetic figures, and isn't necessarily supposed to be taken as a literal person. Christ is the personification of the Laws of Nature, 'The Way' in which man should be living to avoid the suffering that comes from the artifice that is man's law (satan's world). 'The Way' also gives guidelines to living in accordance with reality/nature in its self-existence as to prevent suffering in the natural realm as well. Also, there is no afterlife notion  in the original texts. The Church/Rome really did a number on how people view Christ.

I respect where you're coming from and i hope you don't take offense from my response."
893,2020-11-25 12:28:50,jzzl95,"I would never take offense to someone who is taking considerable time to engage in fascinating conversation, so before I go any further, thank you! 

I can certainly dig everything you're saying and as I mentioned before that was extremely close if not exactly what I believed for a very long time, always switching out ""god"" for either ""universe"" or ""everything"" in prayer situations since it always made more sense to me than a god character.

The main reason why I no longer feel that way is because frankly I can't tell you what reality or nature is. I just don't know and I don't think anyone else knows either. Could be god. Could be a simulation. I could be god. Could be all a lucid dream. Could be something I can't even think about. I just don't know. I think regardless of ascribing a word to it or a philosophy or idea to it, I decided at some point that the real truth of most things is simply and intimately understanding the phrase ""I don't know"". I couldn't honestly tell you if I popped into existence right at this moment with the majority of this comment already written and all of my memories and worldly possessions seeded along with it, or if any of it is real to begin with. There's certainly a fascinating phenom when it comes to what we call a human experience and how it differs so vastly from other humans, even in the same situations at the same places.

In regards to the bible and how people spoke in a time period that I'll never know, I fall back to my same stance which is simply I don't know. I have no idea how people were in a time period before my own or whether any of those times ever even existed in the first place. 

I understand that this is a very ""post modern"" view but I've never studied post modernism and to me that's just a term that someone used to describe my ""i can't really be sure anything exists"" mindset. 

I can tell you though that the only times in my life I feel free and really connected to nature is when I'm doing things that connect me to nature - bow hunting, fly fishing (specifically fly fishing because it's all about using your hands and body to control the line), peaking mountains, caving, chopping wood and building a fire out of it, floating down the Missouri river. Those things are what make me feel truly alive and connected to something more than myself, whereas sitting at my desk and staring at this abstraction of reality called an internet connected computer makes me feel gross and dirty. I live on 23 acres of recreational land that I bought nearly 20 years ago and my neighbors often jib me for doing all of my land management work manually. I don't own any power tools and prefer doing all of my work as manually as possible. There's something very connecting about tilling and planting and building using nothing but your hands and rudimentary tools. I got about 2 cords of wood from a medium sized tree on my property recently and completely done with axes and saws, and if my neighbor asks me one more time if I want to borrow his chainsaw I might just say yes and then throw it in the creek. 

Sorry for rambling on there. I'm old and tend to do that, especially since I can't seem to not be awake at 4:30 am waiting for dawn to rear it's head here so I can go check my traps."

904,2020-11-17 13:54:42,jvqi3a,Our secondary is the worst part. We are so bad on 3rd down week after week...
905,2020-11-17 14:11:45,jvqi3a,"Regarding Tahir Whitehead, who is awful, did you actually write that or did you go to the Raider's subreddit and look through their posts from last year?  I remember reading some of them when we signed him and hoo boy, you are not the first to point out his glaring and obvious flaws.  He's one of the big reasons we can't get off the field on third down, IMO.

*Will Witherspoon, BTW.

I have a sneaky feeling that we will go after Haason Reddick in Free Agency this year because of his Temple ties.  If we do, that will push Chinn to Strong Safety, where he will absolutely thrive.  We should be able to get a stud CB in the draft (unless Parsons is available somehow) and I can see us getting a serviceable, if not good MLB on day two.  If that happens, our defense is going to look completely different next year, and way better at forcing punts.  
  
I wouldn't give up on Boston yet, he is a lot better when the players around him are where they're supposed to be.  You put Chinn and a first round CB in the secondary and it will go from a shit show to a strength, even with Boston at FS.

I also think it's time to move on from Hurney, but I appreciate him for the transition.  I don't think he's as bad as a lot of people here do, but it would be nice to see the franchise trend in a different direction.  The only thing I have to add to what you wrote about him is that we're going to be way under the cap next year.  Hurney got Okung to make the Turner trade work, and we're holding 9 million for Turner in dead cap this year, but that's gone next year.  We're also paying Matt Kalil 9 million, and several other players that will just annoy you to read about.  We have 52 million in dead cap in 2020, and thanks to Hurney's work that drops to 2 million next year.

So, next year we are going to start Free Agency 26 million under the cap.  We can walk away from Short and Paradis and have 41 million to use to sign Moton and a few other Free Agents (this is why I think we're players in the Haason Reddick market).  This is before any of the annual salary cap generation moves happen, like contract restructures, etc...  The bad news is that we're likely going to stick with Bridgewater in 2021, but I am betting that with another year's work the defense becomes our strength and all Teddy 2 yards has to do is feed our playmakers (Curtis will be back, I believe!).

Great write-up, thanks for posting it."
906,2020-11-17 15:42:30,jvqi3a,"So I also think Hurney should be gone but I'd be interested to see how much power Rhule was given in the draft decision making process. 

Because, overall, this may be one of Hurney's best drafts if he held the reigns for 2020 draft. 

1. Brown - Great and will be a future pro-bowl DT
2. YGM - Solid could produce a couple 10+ sack seasons
3. (2nd round yeah but come on) Chinn - Solid and could be a pro-bowl S/LB
4. Troy Pride Jr - Producing like a 4th Rd Rookie 
5. Kenny Robinson - N/A
6. Bravvion Roy - may be an average DT one day 

That's a pretty good draft to be honest. I think you have two Pro-Bowl caliber players in Brown/Chinn and YGM has a chance to reign havoc with Brian Burns and Brown adding pressure to the QB. I know DL is our strong point...kinda...but I'd love to see another DT with above average talent and this line will be ridiculous."

This is a compliment. Dude is a fucking beast. He's always been a blocking TE so it's not as flashy, but he has stood up some of the best edge rushers in the game 1v1. Not many TEs can do that. And he can still contribute in the passing game, even if its more of a surprise factor."

If I were to defend one unit it'd be the offensive line.  First, we all know it takes time for offensive lines to click.  There needs to be time with the same 5 men before even the most mediocre olines start looking good.

With the offseason what it was and the injuries the oline has suffered.  I can't hate on the oline play.  In fact I thought it's been surprisingly decent mainly as you mentioned Teddy is good at hiding it and that the bar initially was so low.

Thanks again for sharing!"
914,2020-11-17 15:28:10,jvqi3a,">But Teddy is not the future. At least not long term

That's the problem. In a ""rebuilding"" year you have to look at long term and start with QB to build around. Cam would have taken a contract that would have allowed us to find that QB. N.O. didn't cut Terry because he would be Bees replacement. That should be a clue.  The reason behind the Terry choice may have do do with just handing off to CMC for the next 4 years. Except for the Oline, I'm not sure where to build except the defense.

>Second and more importantly he’s throttling D.J. Moore

Agree I played d.j. on fantasy and what a disappointment not of his fault. D.J. always has a important drop or two but then he's pretty solid. Terry is like a lot of QB's he's going to go to his man. 

>OL – Its still bad!

Agree always has been but Cam could avoid many sacks. Give Terry so.e time and he'll do better.

>Secondary – It’s also still bad

Bottomline we don't seem to be fixing what broken but breaking what's working.  Great team continually work at a position until it's working. We just seem to be switching what's working creating more problems."

916,2020-11-17 15:06:40,jvqi3a,Why are we in cap purgatory? Thompson's contract has an out next year and Short will be gone one way or another which both free up a ton of cap room.
917,2020-11-17 16:08:54,jvqi3a,"I thought a limited preseason was going to effect teams with new coaches, young players etc. I think early on we squeaked out a few wins but now past week 10 teams with experience and are starting to separate themselves. Tampa has a new coach and new QB but again we're talking future HOF veterans and not a bunch of rookies with coaches that limited pro experience. I feel like we're building a nice foundation and I'm excited for the future but reality is kicking in as far is where we are now."
918,2020-11-17 16:49:13,jvqi3a,I’ll go back and read the rest in a second but I agree with you on Teddy. Now that we have a big enough sample size I feel as though Teddy’s natural instincts hold him back. He’s way too conservative and his constant check downs are maddening when other guys are open down the field. He’s got plenty of talent to be a franchise guy but he holds himself back I think and I’m not so sure you can fix that.
919,2020-11-17 21:12:49,jvqi3a,"The only guys playing in the top 30 at their positions on defense according to PFF is Burns (#6 edge defender), Corn, and Kerr. Obviously that isn’t the end all with YGM and Brown showing promise and Chinn playing extremely well for the most part. We are just hurting so bad for talent and experience on defense. I often wonder how much of Snow’s play calling is hamstrung by his personnel. Douglas is trying hard but is who he is. We don’t really have any quality safeties or CBs. Shaq’s play has him ranked in the bottom handful of LBs in the league. Whitehead was ranked as the second worst in the league. Offensive line has been a major struggle and Teddy is ranked right around 26th. Nothing about our personnel lends itself to winning football games. We are a minimum of two years and roughly ten starters away from really being competitive."

924,2020-11-17 19:03:55,jvqi3a,"Not sure why you're down on Davis when he's been fantastic for a RB2; above replacement-level.  He's trending upward not downward, and plenty of RBs peak in their late 20s.  That said, paying RB2s is a ""make a run"" tactic, not a ""rebuild"" tactic.  We can let him walk, but he deserves decent $$ - maybe Seahawks or Eagles pay him.  RB draft value continues to decline though; save those picks for later rounds.

Curtis will likely be gone - off to a team that will pay him WR2 money.  I can def see Ron bringing him to Washington.  Whatever the reason for Robby's success, lets not mess with it - keep him.  I agree with what you've said about DJ.  I'm fine with Teddy, and unless this upcoming QB class is particularly deep, I'd rather spend a top pick on OL to elevate his game and be ready to protect a future rookie passer.

DB is still a huge weakness agreed.  Our reluctance to invest more there reflects a lack of foresight and adaptation to league trends; offenses becoming more and more pass-heavy.

Pretty much agree with everything else you said.  Tahir is awful.  Let Shaq walk.  Resign Moton.  Its time to move on from Marty - he can't adapt.  I hate to say that, because players with character make a team easy to root for during a losing season."

934,2020-11-17 14:44:06,jvqi3a,"I don’t think that Chinn will ever be a Safety. At least not a dedicated one. He was drafted to be a Spur, and that’s the position he’s going to maintain, I imagine, throughout his entire time in our defense. Putting him into a standard role reduces his versatility as a player"
935,2020-11-17 16:15:44,jvqi3a,"I'm super high on Chinn, however I'm not gonna ignore the flaws I've seen either. Sunday was bad for him but he's a rook. Better chance of it happening than him just look all world all season.

And that's true but that's more Tahir being bad at both tackling and being in position when Shaq has to take the block and bad at block shedding when he has to take the block. 

I can't stress  enough how bad Whitehead is.

But they're bad in coverage too but ar least Shaq has thr tackling part down."
936,2020-11-17 14:37:57,jvqi3a,"On the other hand, Robby Anderson has been an amazing signing and our draftees have been excellent."
937,2020-11-17 14:19:28,jvqi3a,"Did you know we're still paying for Matt Kalil?  This is the last year we're doing that, thank God.  The Okung trade was not about getting a Left Tackle, it was about getting rid of an underperforming Trai Turner and his Dave Gettleman contract.  Basically, it allows us to gain 13 million in cap next year. It was actually a pretty good move if you look at it in cap terms. 

Hurney was looking at a rebuilding team that needed an infusion of young talent and took steps to move all the salary cap pain to this year.  We currently have 3 million in space, with 52 million in dead cap.  Without doing a thing, we're going to enter 2021 with 2 million in dead cap and 26 million in space.  That's what moves like the Turner trade were about."
938,2020-11-17 16:19:17,jvqi3a,Trai has a bad contract and we got rid of it. He's also played 2 games this year. I don't see how you think that's a bad deal
939,2020-11-17 15:46:09,jvqi3a,"It's just coachspeak. GM speak, I guess. What do you expect him to say, ""yeah, we're going to suck this year, but wait a couple of years and we'll be really good!"""
940,2020-11-17 15:29:34,jvqi3a,"Slye is 20/21 on FGs under 50 yards. That's best in the league. 

Granted, he's 0/4 on 50+ but two of those kicks would have been the longest FGs ever made by an NFL kicker (without the advantage of altitude) so cut him some slack. Given his success from 50+ last year (8/11), I'm not at all worried about Slye, and I don't see how anyone could be."
941,2020-11-17 16:18:32,jvqi3a,"I completely forgot about this.

Slye is okay. Improved from last year. We've put him in bad situations. I am indifferent on our P. I want a good punter so badly. Cooper started out good at returns but got progressively dumber and dumber with his return choices. 31, I forget his name, looked good Sunday."
942,2020-11-17 16:20:56,jvqi3a,Yes if you look at us pre-draft and our expectations against how we have actually played (bear in mind we only lost a couple of games on the last drives) then I am overall pleased!
943,2020-11-17 13:42:37,jvqi3a,Some panther fans are just casual football viewers? Wether I agree with their opinions or not we all bleed blue and black so no I will not stop asking their opinions on panther related matters
944,2020-11-17 15:02:56,jvqi3a,">At least not a dedicated one

I agree, he could line up at SS in a typical 4-3-4 set and rotate to the spur position when we move to five DBs.  He's good enough that I want him on the field at all times, and that seems to be the way to do it if we go after Reddick or a similar type player."
945,2020-11-17 14:39:09,jvqi3a,He has been a good signing yes but signing him makes us choose between DJ and Samuel. We can't pay DJ Curtis Cmc and Robby.
946,2020-11-17 14:26:10,jvqi3a,"Okung is 34 hardly an ""infusion of young talent"". We could have traded Turner for actual value though. And we let a great corner walk to pay an off ball linebacker and our defense is still slow as fuck"
947,2020-11-17 13:43:59,jvqi3a,"Even as a casual fan, it’s pretty obvious that Tahir is a liability. 

“The guy that should be tackling the other guy isn’t tackling him” or “why is 52 always in the camera shot when a guy catches the ball?”

Those are all pretty basic level football ideas."
948,2020-11-17 14:44:41,jvqi3a,"Having to pick between 3 good receivers is a good problem to have, and not one that we're used to as Panthers fans"
949,2020-11-17 15:04:20,jvqi3a,">We could have traded Turner for actual value though

Like what, a ham sandwich? Turns out the market for washed up constantly injured players with albatross contracts isn't great.

The Chargers wanted rid of a malcontent on his last year and we wanted rid of an awful contract.

We may could swung a 6th or 7th rounder but taking a shot at a starting level left tackle is a better gamble."
950,2020-11-17 14:28:31,jvqi3a,"Okung was taken on to allow San Diego make the Turner trade, I in no way meant to imply that he was part of the young talent.  He won't be on the roster next year, he was a rental that allowed us to dump a contract.  And we did trade Turner for actual value.

I agree with you about Bradberry, I would rather have kept him than Thompson and I don't think I'm alone in that sentiment."
951,2020-11-17 14:05:14,jvqi3a,"No you're absolutely correct my fellow Tahir truther, but as a whole our defense has been a liability so it's pretty easy to overlook the shoddy LB play when you're watching the entire defense get scorched from a casual fans viewing experience"
952,2020-11-17 14:47:01,jvqi3a,What about opportunity costs though? We could have signed a not dogshit ILB
953,2020-11-17 15:05:25,jvqi3a,Super weird how our team just keeps getting worse and the buck never stops with Hurney
954,2020-11-17 14:56:29,jvqi3a,What non-dogshit ILBs have been available?
955,2020-11-17 15:27:30,jvqi3a,"I don't care at all for Hurney but our team certainly didn't get worse this year. I'd say it's getting better.

Everyone is forgetting our defense was putrid last year too, we just never cared cause our offense was so bad we were never in games in the second half of the season."
956,2020-11-15 22:42:54,juqey8,Cool names lol
957,2020-11-15 18:21:33,juqey8,Hmm why is it all squished up on mobile? I think I might have screwed up somewhere.
958,2020-11-16 00:38:21,juqey8,Our cat is named Dr Linus Purrling.
