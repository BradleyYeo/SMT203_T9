7,2020-02-05 15:38:14,ez9hje,"Great breakdown. I find set lists fascinating especially with larger artists catalogues. Do bands play new material, whatever they want, or the hits that got them to this point? Can't wait to read the rest."
8,2020-02-06 00:01:24,ez9hje,Thank you for such an interesting read.
9,2020-02-06 02:45:18,ez9hje,"I read your other post threads, I'll definitely be reading these as well. Nice breakdown."
10,2020-02-05 15:59:04,ez9hje,"Thank you.

Setlists are endlessly fascinating. For example, in the second London show... Adding ROR caused a switch in the order of the final songs. They didn't just add it.

And, it makes sense for balance. IDZ into ROR might work for a straight up power metal band... But not so much for Babymetal. Separating the two songs was a decision of balance.

It is something the Babymetal team does very well."
11,2020-02-05 04:33:49,ez3pq1,"I honestly think Shakira was good enough to do it on her own. But jlo not so much. I really view jlo as the guest. And even though I view Shakira as good enough I do still know her music, especially in America, is more niche. Like idk Spanish so naturally it doesn't appeal as much to me just like a large portion of the rest of Americans."
12,2020-02-05 04:29:54,ez3pq1,The big joke to me is that they both could have carried it solo back in 2005.
13,2020-02-05 04:32:42,ez3pq1,"Did they want to do it by themselves?

15 minutes doesn’t sound like much, but that’s a lot of energy for a performance, especially the types they gave.

They likely didn’t take a pay cut, so why wouldn’t they make it easier for themselves by splitting the time and effort?"

19,2020-02-05 10:16:59,ez3pq1,They were paid union rates same as the dancers and backup singers. Their real payment is increased interest leading to more revenue for the them.

MJ had the best intro. The build up and tension from his silence was just perfect.
 
 
 
Edit: Just saw that you ranked this show above Prince and Prince is just sitting at 6... Bby what is u doin'?"
30,2020-02-05 00:56:44,ez02m8,"Overall it was meh, being Latin myself I knew it was gong to be rather sexualized for the average American palate. It was fine, but I honestly wouldn't put it past Prince/MJ"
31,2020-02-05 00:20:46,ez02m8,I thought this halftime show moved really fast and it was entertaining. Better than Maroon 5 for sure and that one felt like it took forever and I will never forgive him to what they did with the Spongebob thing.

36,2020-02-05 00:22:48,ez02m8,"Maybe I just don’t like pop performances in general, but what annoys me is that we’re just watching them dance. They’re very obviously lip-syncing, there isn’t much performing going on at all. I don’t get it. I used to love going out to shows and hearing the live versions the songs I’ve heard hundreds of times. I don’t see the appeal in watching performers dance to their own songs and not sing."
37,2020-02-05 00:43:43,ez02m8,"Good write up but don’t agree with the ‘it ruled’ part....to be honest it was pretty bland and didn’t really offer anything aside from a little sex appeal.  I don’t know if I just want too much, but it didn’t rank all that high for me in terms of recent performances"
38,2020-02-05 01:23:50,ez02m8,At this point I think we can let go of any hope of enough of the general populace realizing what “Born in the USA” is about for it to stop being used as a patriotic anthem.
39,2020-02-05 01:02:48,ez02m8,"Potentially unpopular opinion: the show sucked, the performed songs are bland and meh garbage when live or pre-recorded and the performers are among the least culturally relevant ever picked - like Shakira? Is it 2004?"

50,2020-02-05 02:19:06,ez02m8,"Great write-up as usual. I actually enjoyed the show, although as you mentioned about the show the year prior, its tough to tell if I genuinely liked this years show or if last years was just so bad that I thought this was great in comparison.

53,2020-02-05 00:51:01,ez02m8,"The MJ intro will never be topped by anything ever

Katy Perry on a lion was great, but theoretically, anyone could do that. Lady Gaga from the roof was great, but theoretically, anyone can do that. Bruno Mars with the drums on the moving platform, same thing.

MJ is the only artist that could get away with just standing there for two minutes straight doing nothing. It's unparalleled.

EDIT: I'm probably going to flip the Bruno Mars and Prince rankings and put Prince in my top 5. Reason I put Prince there was too many covers. But, aside from ""Where the Streets Have No Name"" as a 9/11 tribute, playing ""Purple Rain"" in the purple rain was the greatest moment in the history of the halftime show."
54,2020-02-05 10:54:29,ez02m8,"This. I wouldn’t put it in the top 10, it’s fine for what it was, but it felt like a Super Bowl halftime show, where some have felt like a full on badass concert."

56,2020-02-05 00:23:15,ez02m8,"Yeah the SpongeBob thing was so hilariously botched that everyone was upset

People who loved SpongeBob were upset because the editing was choppy, the dialogue made no sense, they teased it in their hype video for the show before the game, and it was just used as a three-second teaser to get to ""Sicko Mode""

People who had no idea about the SpongeBob petition were confused because they had no idea what was going on because the SpongeBob part wasn't teed up at all

There were about 1,000 problems with that show that this show would've been near impossible to be worse"

I just want like a SINGER at the halftime show to SING to me, even if it has that ""live esque"" off tune sound, i wish there was more of it"
61,2020-02-05 00:34:03,ez02m8,"When the whole show is lip synced and it’s obvious (a la Michael Jackson at Super Bowl XXVII or Shania Twain at Super Bowl XXXVII), I’ve got a problem

But I couldn’t tell here what parts were lip synced and which ones were not. “Hips Don’t Lie” was definitely not. “Get Right” was definitely not. “Let’s Get Loud” when it was J-Lo not. If there were parts that were lip synced, they covered it up amazingly"
62,2020-02-05 00:26:00,ez02m8,"You realize that dance is a performance art, right? They were most certainly performing."
63,2020-02-05 02:38:49,ez02m8,"It was definitely more political than patriotic in this case, considering the fact that Jo Lo asked where her Latinas were at, the kids came out of cages, and J Lo's American Flag cape was a PR flag on the inside. I think they used Born in the USA on purpose and not just because it's lyrics sounds like a nice patriotic song"
64,2020-02-07 09:37:36,ez02m8,"This halftime show had more cultural relevance than any past one.....the Arabs were praising Shakira, the Africans were praising her and the Latin Americans surely did

She included mapale, zaghrouta and Cameroon dances in her performance"
65,2020-02-05 01:20:58,ez02m8,"Depends on a case-by-case basis

Doing full versions of songs usually is horrible... but it made perfect sense when U2 did it for ""Where the Streets Have No Name.""

Sometimes, a verse and a chorus feels like too much (""End of Time"" by Beyonce at Super Bowl XLVII), and sometimes, it's the perfect length (like we saw at this show).

It depends"

Someone did a mock-up of what an [Ariana Grande halftime show could look like](https://youtu.be/XVvX2swxL64), and when I heard this for the first time, it blew my mind

The pacing on this is just incredible"
69,2020-02-05 15:13:36,ez02m8,Edgy take bro
70,2020-02-05 02:23:49,ez02m8,"U2 has an argument because of the emotional factor. But other than that, yeah, Prince is pretty much a lock for 1. 
 
 
 
I believe Prince's performance was so legendary because Prince was an artist that was, more than anything, one thing above all: a musician. Prince didn't need a guest artist, he didn't need some crazy light show with lasers, he didn't need to play the top pop songs of 2007, he didn't need to have some crazy stage that projected images below him. All he needed was a microphone, a band/marching band, his guitar, and his voice. 
 
 
 
So many artists today get the halftime gig and feel the need to go above and beyond for that wow factor and don't realize that nothing can ever live up to an authentic performance. Prince didn't need any gimmicks or crazy, over the top displays. Prince connected with the entire stadium and everyone watching because he let both his guitar and voice bleed with emotion on stage and that's something that more artists need to realize. Anyone can go up on there and dance around like a mad man and have a bunch of fireworks, but not everyone can go and make you FEEL your performance through a TV screen. 
 
 
With that being said, we need more performers that can actually play instruments at the Super Bowl."
71,2020-02-05 12:40:18,ez02m8,"I mean, the problem is it's hard to rank the Prince show because that was basically just Prince being amazing.  There was very little choreography, the single stage, a bit with the marching band, but other than that it was just a single incredible performance

How do you compare that with something like this show or the Katy Perry show?  Those shows *obviously* didn't have the sheer talent of Prince but had great dance choreography, great camerawork, stage design, costuming, special effects, etc. etc.

It's like trying to compare a really elaborate molecular gastronomy meal versus a single really perfectly cooked steak.  Obviously, some people are going to prefer one over the other, and that's fine, but it's hard to objectively compare them and say one is better"
72,2020-02-05 01:33:37,ez02m8,MJ put up a great show though imo. I mean its not like Shakira/JLo weren't lipsyncing.
73,2020-02-05 00:28:02,ez02m8,"Yeah, the Spongebob part wasn’t even the biggest problem, there was so many things wrong with it and it felt really uncomfortable as a viewer. You could tell even Adam was kinda uncomfortable with a lot of stuff in that show. 

Thank you for writing these out every year. My girlfriend and I enjoy these write ups and I agree with you that this was a fantastic show and that ever since the NFL has allowed there to be pop acts again, the halftimes shows have been great(besides the Black Eyed Peas and Maroon 5). My favorite is still Bruno Mars but to each their own."
74,2020-02-05 03:20:44,ez02m8,"the worst thing too was this was around the time Stephen Hillenberg, possibly THE driving force for alot of old nicktoons show that even today people still watch sometimes or reference, had recently passed away after fighting ALS for years, and finally his heart just couldnt take it.

As a younger person, I was really hoping we would get a really nice tribute, maybe a tiny bit of memorial stuff, and then just give us the BEST sweet victory performance ever. He was very important for alot of people and he DESERVED that honor, on a stage devoid of his context as a cartoonist. I wanted him to be respected as an animator and a pioneer in sense of media

we got sicko mode, which when i started remembering this event from last year,  had a hard time even remembering what the fuck sicko mode was, goddamn the ball was dropped disgustingly hard

80,2020-02-05 11:33:53,ez02m8,"Right? They picked Shakira, who picked JLo as her guest, and then they had two latin rappers join them.

100,2020-02-04 22:45:56,eyxqoo,"I don't mind celebrity makeup lines if the makeup matches the celebrity's signature style.

Lady Gaga struck out big time.  She's known for her out there and wild looks on the red carpet (hello meat dress) yet her first palette was something you could have seen any other brand do. It was just so generic.  Even more of a missed opportunity was that an edgy gothy brand was taking a steep nosedive and the opening was right there on a silver platter.  

To me her line would be like Taylor Swift releasing a makeup line without red lipstick."
101,2020-02-04 21:55:22,eyxqoo,"Absolutely oversaturated! Many makeup lovers & collectors have slowly been getting brand/makeup fatigue. But this comes in waves. 

We all had a time where we excited to try all these new things and to get this palette or this single eyeshadow, so on. As that wave becomes more of a collector rather than an enthusiast, more waves will come. Younger generations will buy into these new brands, just like we did with Colourpop, Fenty, etc. Then eventually they too will get to the point many of us are.

A video by BeautyNews explained this beautifully. While it is oversaturated and although many of us feel like there’s no more room for brands, there are always new, developing makeup lovers who will find excitement in a new brand while many “seasoned” makeup lovers find it unnecessary to the market."
102,2020-02-04 22:26:54,eyxqoo,"I don't care too much about how many celebs launch makeup lines, but I do care when it's a half-assed effort lol. 

Victoria, Rihanna and heck, even Kesha can stay (I don't listen to her music but her palette is lovely!)

but Millie and Gaga....just, so unwarranted lol"
103,2020-02-04 23:56:40,eyxqoo,"Even worse than the celebs, I'm tired of every Joe Schmoe ""influencer"" coming out with their own makeup or collab or whatever. Giant eyeroll for every new influencer palette release. I was entertained by Jaclyn Hill's lipstick release fiasco. Just because you have X followers doesn't mean you know a thing about running a business, formulating stuff, or PR."
104,2020-02-04 22:22:10,eyxqoo,"It’s getting way overdone, especially when some celebrity beauty lines bring nothing new to the table. Fenty influenced a lot of makeup brands to expand their shade ranges when they noticed what an overwhelming amount of people finally found a shade that matched their’s. You have old, traditional brands like Estée Lauder that used to have 17 shades of light-medium, and then less than 10 for everything between medium-dark. I saw Millie’s line at Ulta and while I’m not sure if that was the brand’s intention, it seems geared to tweens/teens to get into makeup without going for a heavy makeup look. But it feels like a lot of celebrity makeup/cosmetic brands nowadays are the same palettes, same lipsticks just repackaged and re-priced."
105,2020-02-05 00:24:34,eyxqoo,"100%. 

That is why I’m super selective on what I support with my money. What made Rihanna’s line so successful from the start, was that she came out with a huge range of foundation tones and they marketed that very well. She gave a solution to a problem that we all have - finding the perfect match for our skin.

And with Selena Gomez, eh, never thought of her as someone that has great makeup looks. We’ll see how she markets her line and what will make it stand out from the over saturation there is in the industry."
106,2020-02-04 23:16:08,eyxqoo,"I'm also finding that we aren't using all of our products in different and interesting ways because it's just SO EASY to buy new. There's so much out there, and yet most of it goes off before it can be used."
107,2020-02-04 22:48:24,eyxqoo,Makeup lines are the new album releases by actors/movies from singers.
108,2020-02-04 23:49:07,eyxqoo,"Honestly! I got a $150 gift card for Sephora and like two years ago I would've been so hyped abt that but now ??? Makeup is all the same, not inspired by anything out rn"
109,2020-02-05 00:18:12,eyxqoo,I feel the makeup fatigue as well. I've actually returned to some drugstore favorites. Cover girl foundation and maybelline mascara. Honestly I've tried and $$paid$$ for a lot of premium makeup and I'm just over it.
110,2020-02-05 01:12:44,eyxqoo,This is definitely a missed opportunity to name it Glowmez.

112,2020-02-05 00:56:32,eyxqoo,"I’m really liking the trend of affordable quality makeup such as makeup revolution, colourpop, juvia’s place, etc. My fav foundation is the stick one from makeup revolution."
113,2020-02-04 23:33:43,eyxqoo,"I generally don’t buy celeb or Influencer makeup, idk there is way too much out there, I don’t need to get more shit every time there’s hype around it."
114,2020-02-05 00:01:31,eyxqoo,"They're huge money, so it isn't going to stop any time soon. Basically every celeb has a fragrance and this to me feels the same. I think if there's effort put in and it's something they give a shit about (or are willing to hire experts who give a shit) it's fine- MBB's line was so panned it probably won't last, and makeup lines go under all the time, so I have no problem with them trying. The good ones will usually rise to the top."
115,2020-02-05 00:10:08,eyxqoo,"I generalllly don't buy influencer/celebrity makeup. I don't know. I'm a bit exhausted with all the new launches. I think that if a celebrity does start their own line though, they need to have an edge for me to be attracted. It feels like a lot of the products just come out of the same factories and are similar."
116,2020-02-04 22:47:42,eyxqoo,Yes I was just thinking this the other day. There are so many companies and palettes now that it is too much. I try to read this sub and get a feel for what are the best brands then buy from them.
117,2020-02-05 01:19:53,eyxqoo,"I don’t think the problem is that it’s makeup, but that it’s the same as everything else. I get that you can only make so many x color of eyeshadows, but there are things I think missing, like an epic duo chrome pallet, a cream shadow pallet. Or even single shadow pallets with a beautiful esthetic. I just think there is for sure a market, it’s just the same releases on repeat that get boring. I don’t care who makes it, I just want something  different, new textures and formulas, a well thought out design, etc"
118,2020-02-05 05:06:11,eyxqoo,"Remember perfume and celebrities? Back in the 1990s and 2000s, it seemed like every pop star had their own perfume. I'd bet that most of them had no experience in fragrance or chemistry. But hey, it sold. 

Do I believe Britney Spears and Justin Bieber were were sitting in a lab somewhere trying to formulate the perfect scent? God no. But half the girls I knew had a teal bottle of Curious on their dresser. 

Make up is a brilliant idea. You can only buy so many bottles of perfume in a year, but you can always use more makeup. 

And if it's not the celebrity that sells it, then it's the franchise. Look a Harry Potter palette. A Disney palette. Are these new colors that have never existed in the spectrum before? No, not really. But put them together with a theme and you've got a hit. People eat that up."
119,2020-02-05 00:25:20,eyxqoo,I've also grown tired of makeup after the market saturation reached a certain point a couple years back. it's been so overwhelming. not to mention the prices of most of it has just been beyond my budget so I can't even get excited about trying anything.
120,2020-02-05 00:31:15,eyxqoo,"As annoyed/fatigued as I am with the industry as a whole, my wallet is so happy lol 😂 I’m really hoping to continue only rebuying products I love, like foundation, face wash, sponges, etc. Only two YouTubers got me last year with their palette launches, but that’s because they partnered with brands that I already trusted/enjoyed. I was intrigued by others, but not enough to buy anything."
121,2020-02-05 09:52:47,eyxqoo,"Am I the only one who’s really bothered by all the plastic waste being accumulated by all of these makeup lines being constantly launched? Unless you’re presenting something original and refreshing, yet another makeup line entering the market is not necessary. Celebrities can’t just do collabs anymore?"
122,2020-02-05 02:40:31,eyxqoo,The world does not need another highlighter .
123,2020-02-05 01:13:42,eyxqoo,"I don’t understand the need everyone feels to own all these celebrity makeup products. I hate wasting money but love makeup, so I have two pallets (one neutral and one colourful) and that does me just fine! I’m excited for Selena’s new line though because the concept sounds refreshing. Loving her take on beauty and makeup being for you, not others. Hoping she has some nice products"
124,2020-02-05 02:26:11,eyxqoo,"I definitely think so. My new year resolution was to not buy any new makeup because I barely get excited for the new stuff coming out anymore. It's getting very stagnant and no one's really as creative anymore. The only makeup line I get excited about is Melt Cosmetics. Their palettes are ridiculously saturated and they have bright unique colours that show up on my dark skin in one swipe. I feel like makeup newbies still have something to get excited about, but as a self proclaimed makeup addict, everything else is just meh."
125,2020-02-05 06:12:24,eyxqoo,"Yes,  there's too much of it 

 The only things I'll be buying consistently: mascara, powder, primer, and lipstick (obviously as replacements). 

I have enough highlighter, palettes, and blush to last for years.  I'm kind of just over it, I'm just glad I don't wear foundation, those usually run high."
126,2020-02-05 11:23:34,eyxqoo,"Oversaturated for sure, but I'm glad Posh Spice got in there with her own line. Her eyeshadows are FIRE."
127,2020-02-05 01:39:45,eyxqoo,"Honestly, I only buy the make-up that I truly like and I genuinely feel interested in once I see the package, colors and final products. 

It has become an over-saturated market but at the same time, there’s an extensive variety for different types of people! 

Maybe, try not to feel like you necessarily gotta buy all of it just because you’re into make-up,  just buy what you absolutely love, and enjoy it while it lasts lol. 

Edit: I fixed some typos that this comment had since I’m posting from my phone."
128,2020-02-05 01:46:13,eyxqoo,I love makeup! Collecting it is my hobby. I don’t wear it nearly as much as I once did. I’m also a complete snob. Buying the next big brand is not my thing. I stick to my favorite brands that I know  are worth the spend. Testing new lines is exhausting and tend to be wasteful for me.
129,2020-02-05 03:39:07,eyxqoo,"The amount of celeb makeup brands is over  broad, however, if the certain celebrity is *passionate* about makeup or starting anew brand (like Fenty, or Victoria Beckham) then I’m down. 

Many, and most, companies are cash grabs. Let’s be honest, but if there are somewhat good interiors or creative/passion for the products it deserves recognition. It’s hard to saw of Selena’s line with hit the mark, since I never saw her makeup inspiring.

I think right now it’s kind of a trend that Kylie Jenner and Rihanna pushed. I won’t be surprised if fashion brands become just as popular among celebrities (already is starting), or easy, targetable markets."
130,2020-02-05 03:41:42,eyxqoo,I think makeup in general has become an oversaturated market. I also feel disinterested because I can't keep up lol
131,2020-02-05 05:56:38,eyxqoo,"I doubt most will still be around in a few years. Remember when making a fragrance was the big thing? Britney was one of the first.. then you had everyone from Jessica Simpson to SJP to Paris Hilton.

The celebs are still pumping them out too! But I think a lot of the older ones that weren’t as successful are no longer around. I imagine the same for makeup."
132,2020-02-05 01:46:42,eyxqoo,"Honestly, I haven’t bought a new foundation or eyeshadow palette in two years. Makeup is supposed to add to your beauty, so I only use a little. Eyeshadow can be used in so many different combinations and ways. I think that you just find something that works, and stick to it haha."
133,2020-02-05 02:39:35,eyxqoo,"I find it interesting that there is a lot of negativity here around Millie’s line, and (aside from some obvious stupid mistakes, like the skincare video) I think that is probably indicative of the age of this sub. 

Her line is not appealing at all to me, personally. But I think she is SO smart to be one of the first brands out there that is specifically targeting Gen Z. They’re growing in spending power every year. I think that we’re going to see a lot of brands start to pop up that emulate this in the next year or two. It’s selling very well because it targets the right market. 

In general, I’m okay with a celeb line if it has a point of view/personality and is interesting. I love VB’s line - I think it’s so well done. Fenty is a powerhouse. Lady Gaga has failed at hers because she lacked those things. I don’t love Selena’s branding so far, but am curious to see what her angle is."
134,2020-02-05 02:51:27,eyxqoo,"Definitely over saturated sector but I can say I do like what Selena’s line stand for which is about makeup that show the uniqueness rather than trying to look like everyone else. 

There are way too many influencers and celebrities with makeup lines that all focus on this heavy face makeup and they all have that same Kardashian/Jenner/influencer makeup aesthetic (if you knowI’m saying) . But I feel like hers seems like a more fresh face, use make up the way you want to, without conforming. So I’m excited to see what her line has to offer."
135,2020-02-05 01:47:51,eyxqoo,"I feel like the industry in general is oversaturated with the exact same products over and over and over to the point I dont even need to buy anything anymore, I have everything I could ever need in 4-6 palettes I've accumulated over a few years (lol @ my expired makeup I def still use every now and then whoops). If I need brights, I have 2 good palettes, nudes, browns, and plums take up the rest. It's almost impossible to find something that stands out and at this point I feel like celebs don't care about quality, and I would say the same about most YouTube MUAs too. It's just getting boring at this point because they're all releasing the same stuff and wont stop releasing the same stuff, even when begged by their audience."
136,2020-02-05 02:59:18,eyxqoo,I definitely find celeb brands to be overrated. There's always a shit ton of hype and the products don't often wow me.
137,2020-02-05 04:23:09,eyxqoo,"I don’t get why she announced it so far in advance. Gaga did this too and legit everyone forgot about it and then it dropped and the reaction wasn’t explosive it was just “huh, I forgot that was going to happen!”"
138,2020-02-05 08:20:18,eyxqoo,"I’ve always loved Selena Gomez and think she’s the most gorgeous girl ever, but when I saw she was coming out with a makeup line my first thought was “...really”.  Especially when she named it after her newly released album- seems weird to me. I sincerely hope that her brand is good though, I lose respect for people who release products just for the heck of it. Fenty Beauty and Tati Beauty are two brands that I can think of that really seem like a lot of passion went into them and a lot of effort, and I personally use their products and love them. Allie Glines just released a makeup bag today, which I think is awesome and I am thinking of purchasing. At the end of the day it’s really obvious when a product is well thought out and when it isn’t, and I’m hoping Selena’s brand is good because I love her and would hate to lose respect for her lol. She’s really gonna have to release something innovative or unique for me to be on board."
139,2020-02-05 09:43:11,eyxqoo,"I think the over saturation of makeup is helping me buy less tbh. When there were less releases and more hyped up products, there was this 'gotta collect them all' mentality. Nowadays even once over hyped brands are not as popular because they're releasing too much (I'm looking at you abh) and people have stopped 'collecting' their palettes because it's no longer feasible (if it ever was). 

There's so much competition now that brands and people need to be making the best quality products. The most standout products to catch people's eyes."
140,2020-02-05 10:03:27,eyxqoo,"I started buying less but better quality - I have my go to products that might cost more but don't spark any rush of ""I NEED TO BUY THIS"" fomo effect. I'm quite happy with my small collection as it is and I haven't used it up yet as of almost 3 years. I don't see or feel the need to have yet another nude palette just because someone slapped their trademark on it. Also it saves a fuckton of money. No one cares nor knows if you have HAUS, Chanel or Essence red lipstick - as long as it looks nice it's all people would see. A red lipstick"
141,2020-02-05 14:02:57,eyxqoo,"I will support any celebrity that is genuinely intrested in the process of make up, Involved on how its made and what value it brings the consumer. Unfortunately a lot of celebrities are just slapping their brand on and give not a single care in the world what is in their products or how it could harm/ affect the consumer. That is why I usually stick to make up brands that show they have a genuine intrest in what the consumer wants, high quality products and there is research to backup on why they have chosen their products."
142,2020-02-05 03:43:11,eyxqoo,"Millie didn’t just create a makeup line- she created a skincare line. It’s honestly really smart marketing, targeting the teen demographic of her followers, and her whole “brand” is self love and acceptance, which is perfect for Florence By Mills, with lots of sayings about loving the skin your in and how self care is important."
143,2020-02-05 03:52:07,eyxqoo,"This is why I’ve been switching to indie brands. While there is always a risk as you cannot swatch in person prior to purchasing, by watching videos of swatches I’ve been very happy with almost everything I have bought. 
Not all indie makeup is cheap, and wait times for shipping can be over a month as many products are made by hand. However, as this thread is pointing out, I’ve just gotten overwhelmed and frustrated at the over saturation of makeup releases. Also, if I’m going to spend money on makeup, I would rather it go for quality versus paying for advertising and a brand name. 
My favorite indie purchases so far: 

Clionadh stained glass eye shadows 

JD Glow highlighter (shades Marilyn and Chaos) 

Terra Moon eyeshadows"
144,2020-02-05 02:07:57,eyxqoo,"I mean, ya"
145,2020-02-05 03:19:50,eyxqoo,"I do feel overwhelmed with just so much new makeup being released in general. But, as long as the quality is good, I don't mind."
146,2020-02-05 05:17:11,eyxqoo,"The makeup industry is one of the few least practical markets. Makeups aren't organized by functions in sections. Instead they are arbitrarily placed mostly based on brands, but even brands can be all over the place in the store. Not oversaturated at all, just a few big companies making everything. Package things a little differently and sell it as a different product. It's actually not very different from the fashion industry in terms of competition, branding, and logistics, probably a lot of the same people too."
147,2020-02-05 05:31:38,eyxqoo,"I would be interested in Gwen Stefani's line P8nt if it ever came out. What you waiting for? Lol My luck it would not be vegan like her UD collab palette, so I wouldn't get it anyway."
148,2020-02-05 07:55:06,eyxqoo,I feel the same. Too many celebrities hopping on the cash wagon and coming out with shitty products no one needs (\*cough\* haus labs)
149,2020-02-05 09:39:22,eyxqoo,"I guess it's just me but there are some of these who I don't feel they have a real passion for their clients. Like The Honest Line(Jessica Alba), she seems so sincere. I really like Meaningful Beauty (Cindy Crawford), Dr Landers (Candace Cameron)..I am just picky and  typically don't trust celebs much anymore. I don't like the hate and condescending hypocrisy of some.  I think I can find plenty with professional cosmeticians and natural chemists."
150,2020-02-05 09:43:44,eyxqoo,I thought the same thing when I saw the announcement for Rare Beauty. Even not celebrity makeup brands seem to be oversaturating the market with release after release of new new new. And now with celebrities starting their own brands it does seem like a lot. It's kind of a turn off to me personally as a consumer.
151,2020-02-05 09:47:08,eyxqoo,Can't wait for Justin beibers skincare line. 😂
152,2020-02-05 10:33:02,eyxqoo,"Gomez is just tryna stay relevant since 13 Reasons Why isn't popular anymore, guarantee you her makeup line is gonna flop. No one will give it the time of day, unless it sucks in which case everyone will blast it."
153,2020-02-05 11:12:55,eyxqoo,"I totally agree with you! I don't even use make-up that often but when I try getting into it, like when purchasing a new palette I feel so overwhelmed and just go back to my old stuff. I would love to experiment a lot more, but like you said makeup sector is oversaturated."
154,2020-02-05 11:16:17,eyxqoo,"I am actually very excited for this one. Selena has always been a big part of my life as a Gen Z kid. I basically frew up with her, not to mention that she is literally so drop dead gorgeous. I have literally been a fan since I first saw her, and honestly I feel like this is going to be a good line. I wouldn’t expect anything less from her, I am honestly expecting a natural line of products but we will see. Nonetheless I am super stoked for this one."
155,2020-02-05 17:47:17,eyxqoo,It's always gonna be a massive thing from here on out as it's what women rely on more than anything else.
156,2020-02-05 00:33:47,eyxqoo,Absolutely. I (a guy) still love makeup but I’ve started to ignore a lot because there’s just too much. Haven’t bought anything major like a palette in almost two years. Don’t see that changing anytime soon.
157,2020-02-05 04:07:46,eyxqoo,"I think its good. I remember back  in 2007 there were only a couple of big cosmetic companies. This is before NYX blew up. It was MAC, Urban Decay and Revlon. This was way back when Temptalia didn't even have her blog/ Then after the beauty YT blew up there were soooooo many new brands to try and it was no longer monopolized.

&#x200B;

I think competition works for the consumers favor. Now  we have so many to choose from and it definitely is a good thing. I dont have to spend $44 on Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer, there we like 20+ to choose from at every price point. Yes, there is good and bad  with all the new companies. Yes, ABH and colourpop does a colab with every single person on YT. I think its mostly good tho. we have so many options and back in early 2000s it wasnt like that"
158,2020-02-04 22:55:28,eyxqoo,"Thank god I don’t care about celeb makeup..it never draws me in and I can continue to lose money on overbuying products I already have cuz I’m honestly petrified of ever running out of products >_>. Like, I’m busy."

160,2020-02-05 01:47:51,eyxqoo,"I’m finding that there’s a lot of product out there, but no real difference to each other. 

I think that’s why everyone went crazy over the Jeffree Star X Shane Dawson collab, it was a new, fresh idea of what makeup can be."
161,2020-02-05 04:03:28,eyxqoo,"I think there’s room for more of the celebrities in question A. Pay attention to their target demographics and B. Bring something special to the table (this goes for all makeup brands really).

Rihanna is so clearly passionate and involved with her makeup brand, and keeps bringing something new to the table, such as her iconic shade range, and usually does so with good quality. Even the snap shadow palettes, while iffy in quality, were still a unique idea!

And as much as I’m not a Kardashian fan, Kylie cosmetics knows it’s customers and consistently puts out cute, quality releases.

Lady Gaga is the other end of the spectrum. She had so much promise of both diverse and unique makeup, and then released 4 white girl nude lip sets and an obligatory red. Liquid eyeshadows might have been breaking the mold 5 years ago, but right now everyone has them and in better formulas and colors too. It was so underwhelming and not at all what people hoped for from her. She just put very safe, low quality choices in edgy packaging like people wouldn’t notice. 

Brands that insist on putting out played out item, especially when the celebrity face clearly doesn’t care about the product either, are definitely over saturated. Brands that actually put in work, ensure quality and a unique style, all while having the founder actively represent the brand can still find room."
162,2020-02-05 01:10:29,eyxqoo,"I find these posts to be so annoying. Who the hell cares if there are a billion makeup lines? Is \*this\* what is taking up space in your mind? Who the hell cares? Just don't buy it and move on. 

I feel just as annoyed when people post about colourpop and it's gazillion launches. Who the hell cares?! It's not important."
163,2020-02-05 11:45:28,eyxqoo,"You don't have to keep up if you don't want to.


Do you like what's already on your table? Good. No need to buy new just because a celeb made it.


Matter if fact you can use what you already have to dupe the celeb makeup. It requires  good color vision, but I had a whole YouTube series on how to make crayon lipgloss dupes of Kylie cosmetics in your own home"
164,2020-02-05 00:11:44,eyxqoo,"Yes, Rihanna's line really reflects her personality. She does minimal releases and the quality is on point. That's the way to do a celebrity makeup line if they want to do one. 

Being a celebrity will get you initial sales, but if they are going to charge Sephora prices for their line they need to have the quality and aesthetic to back it up. Otherwise customers will just feel let down and will be unlikely to buy anything from them again. Not to mention it will reflect poorly on them in general. It's really not something a celebrity should do unless they love it and are committed to doing it right despite their already busy schedules.

Edit: I don't know anything about Selena Gomez's line, but she seems pretty savvy. I think she'll probably do a good job."
165,2020-02-04 23:11:21,eyxqoo,Gaga should be the replacement for KVD in the market in terms of artistic effort and edge.
166,2020-02-05 00:24:26,eyxqoo,"I feel like the only celebrity make up line that's actually worth it is Fenty. It has the authenticity, dedication, and quality that all other celeb brands lack."
167,2020-02-05 00:03:41,eyxqoo,"Completely spot on. 

I really like the aesthetic VB's line; those smoky eye bricks are VB in a pan. Too expensive for me to justify, but definitely lovely. Same with Lisa Eldridge."
168,2020-02-05 00:18:52,eyxqoo,"I actually just took a peek on the Haus Labs website and I’m a lot more impressed than I was originally. The original promo photos were okay, but it reminded me way too much of the 80’s glam rock days and yes, the eyeshadow palette is just straight up boring and uninspired.

But she has some cool products like reusable cat eye stickers that come in different sizes/shapes and apparently blend in seamlessly with her eyeliner. And another sticker set that creates a masquerade ball-look. I’m not into liquid eyeshadows at all, but she has created an extensive collection with unique colors that I haven’t seen from other brands before (there’s probably a bunch out there, I just haven’t seen any brands spend much time on marketing their liquid shadows or heard influencers or even non-influencers talk about them much). 

Shrug. I had expected more from Lady Gaga’s original launch, but it looks like this is just the beginning. Hopefully she takes it up a notch and gives us something truly unique."
169,2020-02-05 00:07:07,eyxqoo,"True maybe more was expected from her first launch, but in the video she did with NikkieTutorials she explained the inspiration behind the palette (and the brand as a whole). IIRC it was the shades she used to throw on really quick when she was performing in bars, or something like that. Plus, Lady Gaga is now known for a lot more than her whacky outfits."
170,2020-02-05 04:36:46,eyxqoo,Yes!!!! I get so bored seeing the same nude palettes being essentially resold under a different celeb name. I hope Selena makes hers unique.
171,2020-02-05 07:22:47,eyxqoo,It reminds me of the Gwen Stefani collab w UD that was all classic/neutrals
172,2020-02-04 22:03:35,eyxqoo,"Yes, makeup fatigue is a real thing. I think this also parallels with my goals for 2020. I want to live more sustainably and not buy an excess amount of makeup that will just sit around and eventually get thrown out because it’s expired. I’m trying to only repurchase when I’m actually out of a foundation, mascara..etc. I’m also trying to save more this year and not just throw money at the hottest makeup trend or item that month."
173,2020-02-05 04:51:20,eyxqoo,"To be fair, at least Millie's brand is appealing to a certain demographic (pre-teens and teenagers). Im sure as hell not buying it but it's not meant for me."

175,2020-02-05 04:38:43,eyxqoo,"HOWEVER— someone like Tina Yong, who’s been a small business owner and certified makeup artist for a decade or two, is much more trustworthy I feel. Her combination palette was lovely and quite useful and I never felt like she was trying to shove anything down her followers throats at all. 

There’s definitely a right way to do something like that."
176,2020-02-05 01:50:55,eyxqoo,"> Jaclyn Hill's lipstick release fiasco

Wow, I don't follow Jaclyn Hill but I used to watch her videos a few years ago, I unsubscribed because I thought she was just going a bit crazy honestly. I had NO idea about her cosmetics and just spent like an hour digging into the drama. Crazy!"
177,2020-02-05 00:10:04,eyxqoo,Yes I totally agree!
178,2020-02-05 18:02:42,eyxqoo,Look I’m just waiting for my boy wubby to release his anime tiddies pallet
179,2020-02-04 23:45:33,eyxqoo,"I'm almost totally sure it's for people just getting into skin care. Like, this is what your mom will buy you now if you're turning 13 this year."
180,2020-02-04 22:59:47,eyxqoo,I don't understand how a 16 year old girl has a makeup and skincare line. That one boggles my mind. I have blemishes older than her.
181,2020-02-05 01:58:04,eyxqoo,Totally agree... I'd be more likely to support a Selena Gomez hair-care line than makeup cos I've been envious of her hair for years lol
182,2020-02-05 08:27:20,eyxqoo,"Completely agree, I've never viewed Selena Gomez as inspiring in the makeup department. Although I'm sure getting your makeup professionally done 100 times over will give you an appreciation for the makeup industry. I think a skin care line would've suited her better because she embodies natural beauty, but we will see."
183,2020-02-05 14:09:26,eyxqoo,I honestly can't even picture Selena with a full Glam look. I feel like the most I've ever seen her do is a red lip?
184,2020-02-04 23:18:16,eyxqoo,"Yup, which creates an issue with overconsumption and waste."
185,2020-02-05 02:18:24,eyxqoo,I think you switched those up by accident
186,2020-02-05 00:29:26,eyxqoo,I'd spend it on skincare now
187,2020-02-05 00:20:35,eyxqoo,Totally agree. I got a gift card and spent it all on skin care LOL
188,2020-02-05 05:27:51,eyxqoo,"Yes! New brands are great, but I think drugstore brands have really stepped up their game in recent years. I can easily buy something for half the price of a highstreet or premium product, and it works just as well, or even better."
189,2020-02-04 23:41:58,eyxqoo,">Tati is lovely, but I think she has no idea about health , yet promotes vitamins.

Yeah, I like Tati, but these vitamins are nothing something id promote personally. Doctors always say that if you are lacking in any particular vitamin, its better to eat foods with that vitamin in it. Doctor Mike on Youtube discourages people from using vitamins, unless directed by a doctor. Plus vitamins are not regulated. They can say they have x amount of vitamin c in it, but that may not even be the case."
190,2020-02-05 01:30:48,eyxqoo,I love Revolution.

Oh capitalism, you sneaky lil’ sneak."
192,2020-02-05 01:44:28,eyxqoo,Well you are in a makeup sub .
193,2020-02-05 00:12:12,eyxqoo,I think Melt might be going for that market.  Their Muerte palette is like nothing else on the market (and great).
194,2020-02-04 23:15:35,eyxqoo,Yes and she was handed the opportunity on a silver platter.  She blew it big time.
195,2020-02-04 23:19:26,eyxqoo,"This is a brilliant idea & I hope Gaga sees it, executes it, then thank yous for it!"

197,2020-02-05 05:47:45,eyxqoo,"Jeffree Star's quality is amazing, and it's mostly (all?) vegan. I don't know if he's necessarily a celeb in the way we're saying here, but he's def top tier imo."
198,2020-02-05 04:01:15,eyxqoo,I just looked up the cat eye stickers. Omg this changes everything.
199,2020-02-05 04:31:54,eyxqoo,"The interview was honestly really cool. She loves the colors and wants people to use them in their everyday shades, not just for ""fun"" looks."
200,2020-02-05 16:48:57,eyxqoo,"Gaga's always been very extra with her style and makeup.  I expected her brand to reflect that.

Releasing a blah neutral palette is as off character for her as KKW beauty releasing a rainbow palette."
201,2020-02-05 13:48:01,eyxqoo,"I think Kesha made her's unique enough (and it had rainbow and glitter in it, which is a given for her)."
202,2020-02-05 00:19:32,eyxqoo,"I'm not quite there yet, but I admire you. I am trying to focus on things I really want though. I let stuff sit in my cart for a while so I don't impulse buy anything. And if I buy something pretty I try to do something that will last like eyeshadow since I know I can sanitize that and keep it for years. I rarely buy liquid lipsticks anymore as they seem far less sanitary than a bullet lipstick I can cut the end off of. It will go bad still, but my dead lip skin won't be sitting in there for a year lol. I've been sanitizing and wiping down all my palettes and blushes which makes them look much newer and nicer and also reminds me of all the makeup I have. I also added everything in the database that I can to my vanity on Temptalia's sight so I can check for dupes I already have of things. I'll get there!"
203,2020-02-05 03:12:46,eyxqoo,"I'm just getting into makeup and clueless and the insanely huge variety and options has had me suck in analysisparalysis for a couple months. I have no idea what's good, what's a must have basic, what's the trash or a waste or not for beginners and so on.

And the pricing doesn't help on a lot of this stuff..."
204,2020-02-05 01:56:10,eyxqoo,I’m doing the same thing :)
205,2020-02-05 11:52:44,eyxqoo,"Very true. 

The worsening quality of my skin pushed me to take a break from makeup in 2015. 
Next thing you know its October and I haven't worn any foundation, voncealer  , blush ect for the year ...



And I'm stretching out wearing any makeup on my face by 2 weeks at a time



I still follow that routeen and my skin is smoother"
206,2020-02-08 15:09:55,eyxqoo,Millies line gives me a glossier vibe but available in person. Ive actually thought about trying it since I perfer very minimal natural makeup & thats what she seems to cater to.
207,2020-02-05 01:51:45,eyxqoo,"I didn’t know it existed until I saw a display at ulta, the marketing was amazing for young girls (tweens / teens). If I had a daughter or was that age myself I would definitely gravitate towards it. I was honestly impressed."
208,2020-02-05 07:28:18,eyxqoo,"I bought the Tina Yong palette even though I have mostly stopped watching her (no shade, just got bored of a lot of makeup videos) because the colours were so different from almost everything that was coming out last year. 

It has ended up being my favourite palette I've purchased in the last few years. The quality is so good and if I'm travelling, I only have to take that one palette and I can do several different looks.

Sorry to gush. I really love it but I never see anyone talking about it."
209,2020-02-05 03:59:16,eyxqoo,"Now, I'll have to look it up, bcz I don't follow anything,  but drama. lol"
210,2020-02-05 00:19:16,eyxqoo,"I mean she's a famous and successful 16 year old, she has the means to do so. Look how much Billie Eilish and many other young stars have accomplished at 16. At her age I was using products that probably did more harm than good (cleansers that stripped the skin, very abrasive scrubs etc) so props to her if it introduces teens to better products."
211,2020-02-05 00:03:28,eyxqoo,"I like the thought of taking care of your skin at a younger age, but I'm pretty sure the products are all shit solely because it seems like a kids play make up brand."
212,2020-02-05 12:26:20,eyxqoo,Totally agree! Unfortunately I am sure she cannot launch her own hair products because she has previously been in commercials for hair care brands. She totally missed out!
213,2020-02-05 00:16:54,eyxqoo,"This! Would love to see someone create a clean, sustainable beauty brand, where you can order refills of some sort, everything is sourced ethically, labor is paid fairly, and it does not come in so much plastic. 
In addition to it being available in-store so that it helps not create such a huge carbon footprint, as opposed to everyone having to order exclusively online."
214,2020-02-05 02:23:46,eyxqoo,"I watched a short video the other day about recycling makeup packaging. Apparently a lot of it is too small to be recognised by the scanners and ends up in landfill. As well as this, the light used to scan items bounces off packaging that is black, which also means it gets sent to landfill. So we recycle and it doesn't do any good"
215,2020-02-05 02:23:17,eyxqoo,"I mean actors who release a music single/album and singers who star in film/tv as a way to expand their career. Instead of putting out a terrible song, celebrities just put out a terrible makeup line."
216,2020-02-05 00:37:24,eyxqoo,"Honestly, I should, but there is still a massive part of me that resists spending more than $20 on a product for skincare haha"
217,2020-02-05 04:12:02,eyxqoo,"There's USP and NSF certification you can look for! It's a little symbol on the label. A lot of Nature Made will have USP certification, for example. It's pretty frustrating to stand in the aisle for half an hour looking at labels, just to find a Vitamin D3 that's USP certified. I wish they would have mandatory certification for all supplements."
218,2020-02-05 01:48:25,eyxqoo,The Muerte palette disappoints me only because of the cluster of dark shades in the center of the palette. There just wasn’t enough variation in shade/tone. I think adding a a muted coral would have looked amazing with the other shades. The red and greens are gorgeous though.
219,2020-02-05 02:03:29,eyxqoo,Very true !
220,2020-02-05 11:55:36,eyxqoo,"This! I bought a few things (buying into hype, I guess) but the packaging is amazing, the colors seem well thought out, and they're unlike anything I have in my collection. 

A lot of people complain about price, but she is *Posh* Spice, after all."
221,2020-02-05 06:01:45,eyxqoo,"He's definitely super famous, but I'd recognize him as makeup brand turned celebrity than celebrity turned makeup brand"
222,2020-02-05 11:06:14,eyxqoo,Jeffree Star is also complete and utter trash.
223,2020-02-05 12:45:58,eyxqoo,"Why are you being downvoted for this?!

I dont understand reddit sometimes."
224,2020-02-05 11:54:19,eyxqoo,"I'm pretty sure it's all vegan. And it's bloody amazing! I love Jeffree, but I wish I had more money to buy his products. But his eyeshadows and lipsticks are out of this world!"
225,2020-02-05 04:32:33,eyxqoo,Omg seriously I need these now!!!
226,2020-02-05 08:20:59,eyxqoo,"Exactly, it was really great and you can see her passion for the brand. She isn't as known for bright multicoloured make-up looks as someone like Jeffree Star is, in fact a lot if the time her make-up is very classic, sometimes with a slight twist."
227,2020-02-06 07:07:54,eyxqoo,"Yeah, Keshas is very unique and I love it haha. I was referring more to lady gaga and mbbs palettes and such. Also Id like to add, I think selenas line isnt a cash grab because shes been working on it for so long (since before the celeb makeup line trend) and hired professionals in the field."
228,2020-02-05 06:16:54,eyxqoo,"Every time you get into a hobby, it’s the same. At first I was lost in the make-up world too, two years later, I can rec products to anyone. However, I’m getting into skincare and I feel overwhelmed again lol. Never ending circle, with so much to learn."
229,2020-02-05 05:43:09,eyxqoo,"Honestly? Ipsy bag or other makeup service. $10 for the sample bag, $25 for the big one. Lots of things to test and play with! 

You can budget easily and if you find something you really like, you can go out and buy it!"
230,2020-02-05 00:19:43,eyxqoo,"If I recall correctly, Jackie Aina reviewed them and they were okay but WAY overpriced, especially for a teen audience."
231,2020-02-05 00:22:14,eyxqoo,"Unless you work in the field of skincare, I don't care for your skincare line. Especially for a 16 year, who probably doesn't even use her own skincare line. Reminds me of Kylie Jenner too...."
232,2020-02-05 04:36:52,eyxqoo,I like the idea of Colourpop’s magnetic pallets that fit individual refill pans. You don’t have to buy a whole new palette when you pan one single shadow.
233,2020-02-05 08:51:50,eyxqoo,Kjaer Weiss does the refill thing. Almost everything is in a pan as far as I can remember. It's quite expensive and I haven't tried it but I know they're at least one doing it.
234,2020-02-05 05:26:23,eyxqoo,"I don't think it can go in with your average single stream recycling but a few companies offer recycling programs - Bare Minerals, Origins stores/counters and I'm pretty sure Back to Mac gets recycled."
235,2020-02-05 04:05:29,eyxqoo,"Ha, it used to be perfume.

Although I love gaga's liquid eyeshadows 🙃"
236,2020-02-05 05:04:37,eyxqoo,Perfume?
237,2020-02-05 01:55:32,eyxqoo,"I""m glad there's not a coral simply because coral looks terrible on me (I can't do anything that has the slightest hint of warm tones).  I took a hard pass on Vida because it's pretty much all warm.  They have a new one coming out that does have a coral in it (I like it, I will swatch it, but I can probably dupe it within my collection.

I will also typically use more than one palette to do a look so not having everything doesn't bother me. 

Normally a shade or 2 that doesn't work for me doesn't bother me.  But for a $58 palette, I want to be able to use all the shades.  For a $7 Primark palette, not so much."
238,2020-02-05 11:53:07,eyxqoo,He was actually quite famous back in the day with his music. But I would say he rediscovered fame after he started up his makeup line.
239,2020-02-05 11:25:23,eyxqoo,I guess I don't understand the down votes and why why he's trash. My SIL buys nothing but JS and we love it. What makes him or it so trashy?
240,2020-02-05 13:23:02,eyxqoo,"More about the general sentiment towards him than his product, I'd guess."
241,2020-02-05 07:18:15,eyxqoo,"You can recycle beauty, skincare, and haircare empties from any brand at l’Occitane boutiques (and they’ll give you 10% off one item) 😊"
242,2020-02-05 04:50:51,eyxqoo,"You're so right about that. I was never super into fragrance so I don't know much about what's out there, but I feel like I see lots of celebrity-branded perfume on sale all the time. Lots of these products aren't even bad per se; there's too many of them, though! I can't keep up. Just wish there was more imagination lately 😔"
243,2020-02-05 10:12:42,eyxqoo,"Shit, you just made me realize that makeup palettes are the old celeb fragrances!

Disclaimer before you read any further: I'm a passive observer of the makeup industry. This means that I may be wrong about some points and I understand completely if you choose to point them out to me.

But why is it that everyone release the same product? If someone comes out with fragrance, another should bring out a makeup palette, another hair care, another skin care, another shoes, and so on. I mean, I get it - celebs are competing against each other for mindshare, but:

1) if I buy A's makeup, my chances of buying B's makeup are going to be lesser. Maybe I'm a makeup fiend, so I do buy both. But then I'll buy everyone else's as well. I won't be loyal to just one celeb's product so I won't be likely to recommend one over the other.

2) if different celebs bring out different products, people are more likely to buy them all more just because we need more products in different categories than more in the same category.

3) are the colors of different makeup palettes REALLY that different? Here is where my ignorance may shine through. But this is a question that pops into my mind every time an influencer comes out with a palette. I think, ""How many blue eyeshadows do I need in my life?"" At this point, someone may point out the famous ""Cerulean Blue"" dialogue from Devil Wears Prada. But I still don't understand it as much as I would like to. 

3a) If you say the quality may differ, I would say this: someone who has the financial resources that a Selena or a Lady Gaga has would not compromise on quality. Jaclyn can compromise because she is not a world-renown celeb. Her reach is limited to her YouTube and Instagram followers and people in the makeup field. It may be a huge pool of people, but definitely not as large as the kind of pool of fans that these celebs have. If they mess up, it's going to be all over the news and a PR nightmare, since it could be dangerous, health-wise."
244,2020-02-06 20:20:35,eyxqoo,I would massively disagree. He was medium famous in a very niche subculture.

246,2020-02-06 06:32:47,eyxqoo,"Oh that's helpful because Bare Minerals & Origins I think are primarily for cosmetics & skincare, but not for haircare product packaging!"
247,2020-02-05 05:16:42,eyxqoo,"And celebrity perfumes all smell the same too! It's always the sweet, floral or vanilla or coconut scent. Not that it's bad, but like you said, I wished there was more variety and creativity instead of being an obvious cash-grab.


Sorta reminds me of that time when I read how Elizabeth Taylor would make perfumes that she herself would wear. There's a photo of her dressing table somewhere and she's got all her perfumes there. I thought that was pretty neat."

258,2020-02-04 19:15:36,eytn6v,Yeah most likely it's connected to that. Otherwise the names are way too random
259,2020-02-04 21:33:41,eytn6v,Black Mamba Baby Mama is Vanessa Bryant who was born in 1982. People might say it's a reach but it lines up
260,2020-02-04 23:35:29,eytn6v,Could be. Black Mamba could just be to match the last name Bryant. Could be two separate terms. All I know is that the flow is sick as fuck

278,2020-02-04 15:09:27,eyqa42,"I mean even if you do define your experiences as aro/ace there’s nothing you can do to change who you are and how you experienced attraction. Whether or not you label it as that, that’s how you operate. The labels are just an easy way to communicate to yourself and others what you mean and help you find community with others who also feel the same. So if you happen to be on the aro/Ace spectrum but you lean more towards women, or whatever other way you’d like to describe it no matter how broad it is when you first start, that’s for you to own! 

It can change, you can discover more about yourself and tweak or completely 180 from there but if you’re worried about a description for yourself, it seems like you may already have a basic working one. Good luck!"

287,2020-02-04 13:17:54,eykxqi,"Okay I'm going to play the counter point here - I've never had a problem going to concerts in NYC. Maybe its hard for the band, but Brooklyn Steel, Irving Plaza, and the Playstation theater are all great venues. I don't really care about Barclays or Madison Square, arena shows are probably the worst thing you can possibly do. They're massively overpriced and they are much less fun and usually the artists aren't that much better anyway. Smaller shows where everyone's on the floor and going crazy and moshing are what make concerts the amazing experience they are, and that's usually not more than 40 bucks. Also, the only band I follow that ever insisted I go somewhere that wasn't manhattan or williamsburg was Streetlight - but even they've had a couple of shows in manhattan. 

Poisson Rouge is a decent venue, going there again later in february. Not somewhere you can really mosh its a bit more upscale than that I guess.

For festivals, their lineups are usually shit, the only one I ever enjoyed was Meadows."

Gentrification displaces the poor, then displaces the artists, then displaces the independently owned businesses, and ends in its natural final form as a condo with a Soul Cycle or Starbucks on the first floor. When there is little available space, that space is not allocated to experimental arts, it's allocated to whatever can make enough money to pay rent: an app for instantaneous high end dog food delivery.

So there are tiers of musicians and some will reliably find room. Your top tier stadium act may play the big downtown basketball arena but will probably play a big arena with a bigger parking lot that people aren't afraid to drive to that is 45 miles outside of the city. The venue is run by AEG or Live Nation. Second act down the ladder play the thousand plus room somewhere in the city. The venue's ticketing is also run by AEG or Live Nation. Then below that is a chasm: touring bands that play a show at a shit hole for ten people and then sleep on a stranger's floor and local acts that struggle to find opening sets for the act that draws ten people. Without affordable space, there is no infrastructure for small shows. In the city I was living, these shows would be in people's basements, communal ""show houses"", warehouses, etc. - non-traditional venues are now the norm."

Motown is an hour and a half by air, less expensive, and a much better time.  The one thing I miss is companionship.

A concert of a band is wanted by the Audience. if your a digital music phenomena, viral one hit wonder, you tour the worlds biggest venues for shure. if not you will pay for your own gig to play in New Jersey.

I’m one of those dreaded bridge and tunnel people, and it sucks that nobody ever comes to Long Island. Even Jones Beach (which is a great venue) doesn’t really get A list acts unless they’re country music. Other than that it’s cover bands and the nostalgia circuit.

Though I buy the gentrification argument, another possibility is that consumer preferences kill the places that might host small-time or experimental music.  It's not *necessarily* bad for new people/money to move into a place and cause the cost-of-living to spike.

310,2020-02-04 15:12:19,eykxqi,"As someone who has lived in Montreal and Detroit, this warms my heart.

Montreal in particular is a great place to see shows. 

* Fantastic Local music scene for a variety of genres. 
* Grateful fans who don't know when the band will be back, so they go NOW. 
* Fun venues at good prices; what's big in the US isn't always what's big in Quebec so sometimes the access is much easier. 
* The vibe is always about having a good time. 

Montreal's biggest draw back is that the mosh pits are weak, if you're into that sort of thing. 

The thing that I miss the most about Detroit concerts was just how absurdly fun they were. The artists always felt like they had a lot of freedom and the energy was always great. They could do 2 or 3 encores, talk to the audience, have a local opener + the touring opener, invite more people on stage, etc. Everyone had a good time and the crowds were appreciative. 

By comparison, concerts in St. Louis don't have the same type of vibe. The crowds are much more low energy (I've seen well performing acts stop in the middle of a song before to ask the audience why they didn't seem like they were into it); the midnight noise ordinance curfew means that the acts are short (there's fewer openers, not as much banter, and never more than 1 encore). It sucks but I get why a lot of groups don't like to come here. 

New York is fun, but I agree it's really limited. When I travel there if there's a show I can see that is easy to get to I'll see it, and by the looks of it Brooklyn Steel has done a decent job of bringing acts to that part of the city so people don't need to flock to jersey, but it's from from an accessible city for touring musicians."

Not naming names but I was watching an interview with a NYC electronic music artist filmed in their ""studio"" which was clearly their closet of a room with a small bed and one of those rolling clothes racks for a closet. It's easy to see why so many artists move to cheaper, better places in Berlin and enjoy reliable bookings at European clubs you can get to in a few hours by train."

325,2020-02-04 18:10:31,eykxqi,LPR is the largest of these venues but it's barely a music spot. The calendar is all cornball tourist trap events and cover bands.

Lol its really not that bad. Other Americans have a bit of their own weird mythologies about the place as a gritty cut throat heartless town that sucks the life out of you. One part of that is just a cultural misunderstanding - New Yorkers are big on minding their own business, so they might come off more cold to other Americans who are more used to being more talkative with strangers. New Yorkers are still nice people and they'll be helpful to you, they just keep to themselves a lot so they might come off as cold or rude to someone who isn't used to that. I do think the city is pretty cuthrought, but for me thats part of the draw of the city. The hustle, the energy.. its addicting. If Im in vacation in europe for more than a week I start getting antsy. I really couldn't live anywhere else.  Its a very fun and fast-paced city - whether its cold, life-sucking and heartless is up to you. Also, the crime rate in NYC is dead low, so you don't really have to worry about that anymore.

362,2020-02-04 23:31:21,eykxqi,Cities live and breathe. They do have different personalities and charms. I dont think it's unfair to personify them. After all they are literally defined by their sheer number of people and what's more personifiable than people?

364,2020-02-05 04:18:31,eykxqi,"I think he did, not sure where. This show was at the Convocation Hall at University of Toronto.  Definitely see him if you get a chance, he's like a force of nature.  Another reason I prefer smaller venues in smaller cities, I got to meet Nick Cave at his spoken word event at the Academy of Music in Northampton, MA.  I would never get that experience in NYC."
365,2020-02-04 16:59:08,eykxqi,I agree but also I feel the underground NY scene is especially notable. I’m not from NY but I’m big into the scene so that’s why I feel that ig
366,2020-02-04 22:12:28,eykxqi,"Yeah that's a large part that you can't ignore - that the *industry* is there (and in LA). Logistically and economically it's where a lot of things happen, where a lot of music is recorded, etc., even if you're not based there."
367,2020-02-04 19:43:30,eykxqi,"New York is still definitely the #1 place where the most talented young jazz musicians want to go study and build a career and make a name in. The jazz clubs are pretty small though, you can even play acoustic so logistics aren't a big deal for jazz musicians. There are a lot of places to play and a lot of talented jazz musicians, great for networking and playing a lot of live gigs - gigs pay poorly though compared to many other places.  
This is primarily for playing live, though, in current recorded jazz music with younger audiences London was a much hotter scene than NY in the 2010's. Still, for someone looking to play the highest quality jazz in the bop tradition with the best trained and most experienced musicians in the world in the style - there's no place like New York."
368,2020-02-04 23:48:54,eykxqi,And all cities live and breathe at different levels. I won’t name some cities that I never want to visit again but they felt like they needed a respirator.

387,2020-02-03 22:03:28,eybifo,"That is an amazing setup. I do sports broadcast regularly off an Artemis, and in sports the A1 is generally in charge of their traditional role as well as splitting your job between themselves and the A2. I can't imagine how he would have been feeling without you there 😅😂.

Also in regards to the memory sequences, our crew generally just uses them to save settings for different shows (eg baseball vs basketball, etc) as that's way more functional than the intended purpose for us. Not sure if that's typical across the board, but that's also what we see ESPN engineers doing when their crews sublet our facilities."
388,2020-02-03 23:25:40,eybifo,"I'm not a live sound guy, but video experience taught me most of the keywords here, so I quite enjoyed seeing behind your curtain here. What really surprised me is that a MBP running Reaper was able to capture 164 channels in realtime. I expected you'd need a lot more horsepower for that. Guess I haven't pushed it that hard in the studio. 

Thanks for the write-up, very informative and educational!"

Clocking issues... they can drive a person insane. I would be curious how you were interfacing the different clock sources and sample rates though."

393,2020-02-04 03:06:15,eybifo,Oh man. I'm so happy for you.  I started out in live sound and quickly transitioned into the studio/production side after realizing how stressful high level gigs like this can be.  Clicking through these pictures nearly gave me a panic attack!
394,2020-02-03 21:16:00,eybifo,This is the kind of stuff I want to see. Thanks for doing this.
395,2020-02-04 03:31:22,eybifo,"My immediate questions and I've never worked on anything with more than high school events and community groups are
Do you always have that many inputs? Like when does it become over kill and unnecessary. 

Also that picture of the reference mic with a side fill pointed right at it. Wouldn't that just be over powered by any music or other noise on stage?

Thank you this was super fun to read about and gain more insight on."

Awesome job my friend"
401,2020-02-04 01:56:04,eybifo,I noticed you used Waves MultiRack instead of SuperRack. Was there a specific reason?
402,2020-02-03 21:21:55,eybifo,I loved working with Eddie. We had a good time together. I'll show him your comment!
403,2020-02-03 19:05:43,eybifo,The snare verb and Lady Gaga long verb was from the Abbey Road Plugin Collection (don't recall exactly which plugin) while the Lady Gaga short reverb was RVerb.
404,2020-02-03 23:05:30,eybifo,"Most of my year is sports as well, so it's always exciting to do entertainment shows. I love it. Definitely too much for 1 guy to handle. We also had a comms person on this show, handling Azedit in the truck and a Freespeak RF system."
405,2020-02-04 00:08:27,eybifo,The new macbook pros have some serious power
406,2020-02-04 00:41:32,eybifo,"The MBP and Reaper performed flawlessly. We had recordings going 2 hours with no hiccup. One huge difference though was using SSD's. We tried a normal Lacie drive and it couldn't keep up at all. Recording was ok, but playback was super glitchy. Definitely need a SSD for this many channels."
407,2020-02-04 00:47:23,eybifo,I know!! 3 MADI streams and analog I/O in a box a little bigger than your hand. Amazing gear.
408,2020-02-04 10:59:40,eybifo,"The MADI router I was using was pretty powerful and let me choose clock reference for individual inputs, and specify a source to output to other devices. On the FOH side, they were using something to step down the 96k sample rate to 48k. Didn't have time to go check it out, but at least the streams coming from them were the correct sample rate. I chose each incoming MADI stream as it's own clock reference. Of the three streams going to and from the Calrec, I chose word-clock for 2 of them, and the third had to be it's own reference. Word-clock just didn't lock for some reason. The RME units used the incoming MADI stream as their reference, and the Calrec was using video black. I had SRC turned on for the inputs and outputs of the Calrecs MADI cards.

One exciting moment was about 40 minutes before the live show started, just as we were doing the final line check.. We started getting clicks and pops on Lady Gaga's main vocal mic. Of course, the most important thing of the night. I went into troubleshoot mode and ran through everything I could think of. Eventually ended up merely unplugging the incoming MADI streams and plugging them back in... What do you know? It worked. I guess it forced a re-clock? They had been locked for days at this point, not sure what made it decide to lose lock. Man, that got my blood pressure up though."
409,2020-02-04 11:43:50,eybifo,"Call me crazy, but I love the high pressure environments. I get bored when things are easy, so I need that extra stress and challenge to keep it interesting!"
410,2020-02-04 06:35:00,eybifo,"Each show is different, and it depends on the artist. This is the largest music show I've worked on, with the most amount of channels for sure. Is it overkill? I don't think so. Her band has 2 guitar players, a bass player, drummer with a full kit and electronic pads, keyboard player with a number of keyboards and synths, dancers with mics, multiple mics for Lady Gaga, vocal effects, reverb, audience response mics, and a number of playback channels and background vocals. It really starts to add up!

It's hard to get ambience mics away from the PA, and yeah some of them might have been a little close to a side fill or something. They're used lightly during a song, and then we'll ride them up during applause or if there's a sing along. Definitely can't keep them open during the entire song. Too much bleed."
411,2020-02-07 22:56:45,eybifo,I must know you mysterious Reddit friend! Haha
412,2020-02-04 04:26:03,eybifo,"No specific reason. I haven't had any experience with SuperRack, and the server we were using didn't have the license. I'm going to look into it now though!"
413,2020-02-03 22:00:04,eybifo,Tell him Jeremy the Riedel guy says hey!
414,2020-02-03 19:15:01,eybifo,[removed]
415,2020-02-03 23:14:24,eybifo,A dedicated comms guy?!?! Maybe I should look into getting into the entertainment side of things 🤔🤔🤔
416,2020-02-04 01:19:47,eybifo,"Wait, what format were you recording in?

164 channels at 48/16 WAV works out to around 30MB/sec, total volume over 2.25TB. 

I'm assuming this was a TB3 external? Or not capturing uncompressed?"
417,2020-02-04 01:58:33,eybifo,What have your experiences been with Reaper? It's amazing that a low-cost product is finding its way into major production environments.
418,2020-02-04 02:26:35,eybifo,"What were the specifications on the MBPs, and did you have any Catalina-related issues?"
419,2020-02-04 16:19:18,eybifo,"If you are taking MADI feeds straight from the Digico SD racks on stage, they have a split MADI output that can be set to run at either 96K or 48K if the Digico system is running at 96K.

For this kind of scenario I find the direct.out SRC to be invaluable - the touring system can keep their usual clock set up and all the MADI lines can be re synchronised to the truck reference at the incoming feeds. Hopefully the rest of the truck is synchronous anyway, so you should avoid any Wordclock issues. They can also handle 96 > 48K down conversion if needed. 

Another product that is quite popular with some of the broadcast companies doing music festivals with multiple touring band set ups is the Appsys Multiverter which has several conversion options and can be fitted with SRC."
420,2020-02-05 15:52:11,eybifo,"Hypothetical question: Did you have a backup plan in your mind if you couldn't get the clock-sync issue with Gagas mic worked out in time?

I hate when uplugging/plugging works. Makes me lose faith in the system I'm running."
421,2020-02-04 07:43:18,eybifo,"Watched the video stream -- sounded great! The audience though... suuuuper quiet, no? There was virtually no audience/applause/etc. in the stream, although I did skip around a bit, I [think] I watched enough. Did that go as planned?

Overall though, seriously good job -- jealous!"
422,2020-02-04 04:43:47,eybifo,"Let me know what you think. Did you see the DM I sent you? 
(I'm curious what Waves bundle you'd recommend for most live use cases.)"
423,2020-02-03 19:28:13,eybifo,"I'll check with the mixer, see if he's comfortable sharing. I'll tell you though, it's not much. She's an amazing singer, and her voice doesn't need much. She was 100% live vocal, no autotune, no lip synching."
424,2020-02-04 01:27:27,eybifo,"We were 48/24. WAV files. I don't recall the exact brand of SSD unfortunately, but it was a USB type A connector."
425,2020-02-04 04:27:54,eybifo,"All my experiences have been positive. It's a little awkward for full on editing, I'd much rather use Protools for that.. But the track limit when using non Protools hardware means Reaper definitely filled a need for us. It worked great recording these tracks. No errors."
426,2020-02-04 18:51:40,eybifo,"Awesome information, thanks for sharing. I'm saving this post in case I do another event like this, I'd like to really tackle this reference stuff properly next time."
427,2020-02-05 16:11:11,eybifo,"If the clock-sync issue wasn't worked out in time, we could have used the 32 analog stems that arrived over the Hydra stage box. That would have given us a full mix of the show without having to worry about sync. It wouldn't have been the mix we worked on, but it would still be a full show. Next in line as a backup, in case even the Hydra stage box decided to die, was an analog FOH board mix coming to us over DT-12. So, I had redundancies built but I'm glad I didn't have to use them. I probably wouldn't have made this post if something had failed haha."
428,2020-02-04 10:13:44,eybifo,"The guys mixing definitely favoured the music over any crowd noise. The problem is once we open crowd mics too much, we get all the PA bleeding into them which really mucks up the mix. So, there was a decision to make sure the music always stayed clean and then once there was an applause break the crowd was pushed more.. But again, it has to be subtle or else you'll notice an obvious crowd push and then pull back. I think personally there could have been more crowd, but it's not that easy to just add more without compromising the music mix. We tried using Lady Gaga's vocals to sidechain a multiband compressor on the crowd group and that achieved some good results.

I also noticed the crowd just didn't make as much noise as you'd expect. There were a lot of VIP's and corporate clients in attendance who just don't go as crazy as if the whole building was Gaga fans."
429,2020-02-05 04:10:08,eybifo,"Oh! Had something important to add to my previous comment about this.. I was just watching the Super Bowl halftime show and one big thing about audience sound in live TV, is that most of it is ""sweetened"".. There's typically a guy playing crowd samples to add more crowd sound into the performance without sacrificing the quality of the mix. I've seen a guy come in with a keyboard and sampler and he just plays the crowd like a piano. So, you may be accustomed to hearing canned audience in a lot of performances, whereas ours was real."
430,2020-02-04 04:59:34,eybifo,"I'm probably not the best guy to give that kind of advice. My main background is mixing sports, and we don't often get the opportunity to use plugins in most shows. The creative decisions about which plugins to use in this show were made by the two guys mixing the show. I personally looked at plugins I'd like to start using and for my purposes mixing live TV, I plan on getting the waves noise removal stuff and a mono to stereo plugin.. For most shows I do, anything else would be unneeded."

432,2020-02-03 21:09:52,eybifo,Yeah I gotta ask if you can share her live chain.
433,2020-02-04 20:10:48,eybifo,"No problem! Most of the kind of shows I’m involved in are in the crossover of live music and broadcast. I’d say probably 75% of the time we try and do a full analogue split with separate stage boxes for live and broadcast. The remaining 25% are mostly MADI from stage racks to the truck or studio either via SRC or by clocking the live system to the truck reference. For example I have a show later this month that will be a pair of Digico sharing a couple of SD racks for mons and FOH with MADI straight from the SD racks to the truck. We’ve done this show a few times and take WC from the truck to clock the Digicos, but usually put something like a Rosendahl Nanosync in the way to buffer the clock source for the PA. if for any reason the truck feed to us gets disconnected, the nanosync freewheels at the same sample rate and we don’t get any clicks or bangs - bad enough on studio monitors but truly horrendous through an auditoriums worth of PA! Feel free to drop me a message if I can be of any further help."
434,2020-02-04 05:42:58,eybifo,"You'd get the ""Turn the goddamned NBA PA down"" plug in I bet... If you find it, please let me know."
435,2020-02-03 20:15:00,eybifo,"A very talented one at that. I enjoyed her music before, but after seeing her live, knowing first hand she's singing every single note, and realizing how much she and her band put into their performance, I have more respect for sure. That band was tight.."
436,2020-02-04 06:29:50,eybifo,"I'm a Canadian, so for me it's the ""turn the damned NHL PA down"" plugin.. These buildings get louder every year."

522,2020-03-28 07:27:39,fqf2me,"Shalamar’s [A Night To Remember](https://youtu.be/x9IimLb3b2U) is a personal favourite. I’ll admit, in a dance song I love to hear about love. Brings out the best emotions for dancing when you’re trying to make eyes at someone cute in the club, or your dancing in your room alone thinking about the person you like. It’s timeless.

However, self-love and individuality for dance songs is also a favourite! I’m personally a fan of K-Pop, but the genre is filled with “I love you, why won’t you love me, how could you hurt me, I want to seduce you...” and so on and so forth. But a newer group called ITZY have been releasing some awesome self-love, girl power bops and their new track [Wannabe](https://youtu.be/fE2h3lGlOsk) makes me wanna dance and scream at the top of my lungs that I just wanna be myself! So this could be a great theme to go with too if you’re looking for something fresh and with the times. The [instrumental](https://youtu.be/JK70WtOjaIQ) on this track is really fun and goes a lot of different places, if you wanna give that a listen too!"

525,2020-03-28 13:14:30,fqf2me,"The entire Dirty Vegas album.

I could say ""Days Go By"" but the way the entire album presented itself is better than any one song on it. They straddled a line between the droning one chord short pattern of early sequencers and the four chord loop of a guitarist, and made a whole album that really only slows down to breathe twice, all the songs flowing into each other as a single performance.

Underworld ""Pearl's Girl.""

They became masters of the short pattern that you don't get bored of even though it plays for 8 to 12 minutes uninterrupted. It might be tempting to match this to a flowing melody as what happened with Donna Summer's ""I Feel Love,"" but instead almost the entire song is one note, the 5th scale degree. The lyrics are surreal but make some sense if you can actually hear them, and the rhythm creates intentional syncopations that play counterpoint with the other parts. When the song's lyric repeats from the beginning, a pad sound is added to mark the climax point. When you hear an older person complaining that EDM is too regimented and that build/drop is boring, it probably means that person liked music like this.

Information Society ""What's On Your Mind (Pure Energy)""

Freestyle was an underground dance music where you'd take whatever cheap synthesizer, drum machine, and sampler you can afford, and make a pseudo-latin music with the kicks in more of a hip hop pattern instead of just 4 X 4. You make friends with a teenage girl to sing an out of tune melody about heartbreak, and that's the song.

Instead of that, 3 Midwest nerds and a girl they met in New York bought 8 rack DX synths, 2 samplers, and some analog kit, sequenced it with a computer and then recorded that to 48 tracks, taking those songs about heartbreak and making them into dramatic performances with a proper verse/chorus/bridge structure.

I can easily go on about more songs than this and may come back to edit."

631,2020-03-28 14:11:54,fq8iy0,She is not required or expected to publicly support anyone. It's not her responsibility to advocate for anyone.
632,2020-03-28 14:52:14,fq8iy0,"Not true. Lady gaga is a public figure who has become a mega star for her support for marginalized groups. Thus, the expectation is for her to continue doing so. Regardless, I just said I'm disappointed. One the huge reasons I have loved lady gaga for years is because she is willing to stand up for whats right."
633,2020-03-28 15:17:03,fq8iy0,There are thousands of public figures. Don't expect something from her unless you expect it from all of them. Her fame does not make her responsible for anything. You're being ridiculous.

We being Indians obviously ate up the story about a famous cheating star and a Hindi tattoo on a white person. 🤷‍♂️

676,2020-03-28 08:53:16,fq51xf,"Beckham was really crazy famous because of the following, other than of course for being married to Victoria: Good looks. Girls were really crazy about him. He used to play for ManU, which at that point of time was the most prestigious club to play for, and EPL was the richest league combined with the influence English media had over the then footballing narrative.mHe was the Captain of a star-studded Engish football team. It was almost a dream team of sorts. He won many crucial matches for England. Most importantly he was one of the best dead ball player of that time and one with good looks, unlike the handful others. Dead ball specialists always have had a huge fan following because of them being at the centre stage during climax phases of matches.

And as for the need to be famous? The answer is brand endorsements. He used to be the highest earning footballer in spite of him not being amongst the top 10 footballers of his time by a distance!"

Let's face it, we'd be here all day if I were to continue.

I think she made some tweet about it around that time saying she didn't know if they were true or something, it was looong ago.) showed that they(she was raped and I guess this song was about it) could take her body but never take her mind.

At the end of the song she says ""Same DNA, but Born this Way!"" A few times. You just have to listen to the song to get the jist of what I've explained.

737,2020-03-27 20:05:53,fq1u73,I agree. It is an amazing song but at least it is rising!
738,2020-03-28 02:12:48,fq1u73,"Artists can only have 3 songs in the entire top 100 (as lead artist) - 'bloodline' actually never charted here at all, it was blocked in the first couple of weeks by 'needy' and then fell back behind 'thank u, next'."
739,2020-03-28 13:56:24,fq1u73,Not US's fault. Aparently Dua's team didn't send it to radio because it might cut into DSNs gains. It's doing well on streaming.
740,2020-03-28 08:23:16,fq1u73,The fact that you had to go back 3 years proves we have better taste.
741,2020-03-28 04:47:19,fq1u73,"a dance remix with a full production video, idk if i’ve ever seen that. good for Saint Jhn if it gets his name out there. I hope he doesn’t change his style too much. None of his new music hits quite like Collection 1 (who remembers that iconic intro?) although i do like Cult4Ever from Ghetto Lenny’s Love Songs. I’m scared he will change like The Weeknd (rip trilogy days)"
742,2020-04-14 17:42:10,fq1u73,That kid who remixed it did an amazing job though
743,2020-03-28 08:31:29,fq1u73,"Ok, A country where Someone You Loved was number 1 for the year does not get to brag about good taste"

745,2020-03-28 17:21:59,fq1u73,Someone you loved was an epic bop maybe you have no taste.

747,2020-03-27 17:28:19,fq09ov,oh heidi is easily winning this
748,2020-03-27 23:19:06,fq09ov,WIDOW ROBBED OF TOP. But I'm satisfied with WIN WIN HIGH.
749,2020-03-27 17:50:23,fq09ov,I find it really stupid to judge Heidis lip sync skills before I actually have seen her lip sync on the show
750,2020-03-27 17:52:05,fq09ov,In the first challenge she had to lipsync her verse.
751,2020-03-27 19:09:23,fq09ov,I think you can also judge from lip syncs she’s done outside the show as well

768,2020-04-21 14:37:16,g5exet,That and Stupid Love is in the top 10. Stan Croatia!
769,2020-04-21 16:04:31,g5exet,"Pokušavam naći no izgleda da nema od Srbije nikakva top lista, ako nađem pošaljem. Podatke sam izvukao odavde: 

Ovo je za službenu top listu [Official Croatian Chart](https://radio.hrt.hr/clanak/arc-100-datum-20-travnja-2020/228383/), naravno to je samo radio jer nema nikakva streaming služba osim Deezera i Youtube u Hrvatskoj, a i ne koristi ih toliko ljudi da prave ikakvu promjenu. 

Ovo je za Deezer [Official Daily Deezer Chart](https://www.deezer.com/en/playlist/1266971131), ona se mijenja svaki dan no ja samo uzimam podatke od dana kada objavljujem ove objave. 

I ovo je za Youtube [Official Weekly Youtube Chart](https://charts.youtube.com/location/0x133441080add95ed%3A0xa0f3c024e1661b7f?date_end=2020-04-19T00%3A00%3A00Z&hl=en-gb), postoji opcija na toj stranici da pogledaš zadnjih 7 dana tako da izaberem tu opciju pa gledam koja je novih top 10."
770,2020-04-21 16:52:36,g5exet,"I think it's a combination of it being a small country so there is less effort required to be #1 because of less radio stations. 

No streaming whatsoever except for Deezer which is not used a lot and it being Europe which loves pop. There are rumors going around of us getting Spotify soon so I'm looking forward to that.

But it's an official chart so I'll take what I can get. It's also interesting to track and see how it changes."
771,2020-04-21 16:05:15,g5exet,"Oop, looks like I missed that, thank you for notifying me!"

776,2020-04-22 09:29:26,g5exet,We have TikTok but it isn't taken account for streaming. That may change doon because Apple Music just arrived and Spotify is coming soon.
777,2020-04-22 19:46:12,g5exet,"Ma kužim, ali svejedno se računa i zanimljivo je pratiti. Ona glavna lista je većinom ono što se pušta na radijima koji su prijavljeni na to praćenje, ako se ne varam postoji 130 radio stanica koje to prate, u ovome [članku](https://airplayradiochart.com/2020/04/14/the-weeknd-blinding-lights-je-najemitiraniji-i-najstreamaniji-strani-singl-u-hrvatskoj/) baš piše o tome

 >O kolikoj skučenosti se radi, govori podatak da je za zauzimanje prvog mjesta u Hrvatskoj bilo dovoljno da se pjesma emitira na 44 radijske stanice s prosjekom od približno šest emitiranja tjedno. Podsjetimo, mjerenje popularnosti obuhvaća monitoring rotacije na preko 130 radijskih stanica u zemlji.

Ova lista koja je objavljena je lista samo za strane pjesme dok je lista za domaće i lokalne pjesme odvojena od nje. 

[Top Lista Domaćih Pjesama](http://www.top-lista.hr/www/hrtop40-15-tjedan-2020-06-04-2020-12-04-2020/) također postoji no nju nisam stavio u post jer nisam mislio da je to nešto što bi ljude ovdje zanimalo. Mogu ju dodati u sljedećoj objavi. 

>Najrealniji rezultat ces dobiti preko youtube trendinga i deezer top liste (ako nemas deezer i zanima te javi se slob ispisacu ti ja)

778,2020-04-21 18:25:09,g5dpne,"I am a 21 year old college student and have lived with a few different roommates and I’ve learned that just because they’re older than you doesn’t mean they’ll be more mature. The 25 year old that I live with now is just ridiculous. I lived with someone my age once and she was insane and not paying rent. I called her mom hoping for some outside reasonable adult perspective. Turns out the 20 year old immature nut job was raised by the 50 year old immature nut job mother. 
I’ve decided that 9/10 roommates don’t work. Too many people are gross and immature. Not worth the gamble"
779,2020-04-21 19:19:58,g5dpne,"Wow I thought these were maybe younger adults who were just starting out on their own. Not that it makes the behaviors ok, but it would make sense at least. The fact that they are practically middle aged adults and act this way is unfortunately probably a sign they're set in their ways and don't care. I guess since you seem to have the support of your other housemates I'd suggest coming to them as a group and confronting them together. Maybe it they here it from more than one of you they'll get a hint. Probably doubtful though. Sorry and good luck"
780,2020-04-26 03:51:42,g5dpne,"Start throwing their wet laundry on the ground when its done and don't give a shit about it.  You want to cook something and their in the kitchen squatting, tell them to get the fuck out and cook your food.  Stop being so nice at this point, you've tried that route and nothings come of it.  It's time to start fighting fire with fire. 

Honestly the one part of this that really struck a nerve with me was the issue with your plants haha.  I love gardening but one thing everyone knows is DON'T MESS WITH MY PLANTS.  Thats where my self control would have abruptly ended with these two and mistakes would have been made (I know, weird thing to be my trigger with all the other stuff you mentioned but I've accepted this aspect of my personality long ago haha).  

You've shown crazy amounts of patience through this and you shouldn't be expected to continue doing so.  Its time to get all the other roommates involved as well and tell these two garbage people to cut the shit or get the hell out."
781,2020-04-27 20:34:20,g5dpne,"Just an update, today reached breaking point when I caught one of the couple messing around with my property.. when I confronted them about it I was given a barrage of abuse them calling me a dirty gypsy for trying to steal this property... When I told them in somewhat disbelief that it is mine and I have the receipt to prove it if necessary they continued to say I was lying and stealing....

I made a complaint to the landlord agency and they said they would have a word with them..  I'm viewing a new room completely separate from all that is associated with this property tomorrow afternoon."
782,2020-09-26 00:28:12,g5dpne,"Without the final say in the matter, and legally being on the same level as those schmucks, I would say that being aggressive is a really good way to an all out war. 
That couple sounds like they are stupid, obnoxious and unaware of how toxic they are, by showing how annoyed they make you feel, they will feel totally justified by upping the ante in retaliation. Not a great way to de escalate the situation. 

Some people will never understand how horrible they are to live with, and though it would be tempting to destroy everything to do with them, burn their lives and maybe leave them stranded in the woods with no phones or music players or lighters... it's technically you who would be creating more conflict, and people like that will make damn sure that it looks like you who's starting the fight.

The only way is clear, open, non aggressive confrontation, spelling out in no uncertain terms what is and isn't acceptable behaviour, and open communication with the agency and other housemates. If everyone else really hates them, and they alone keep breaching the contract, then they can be evicted. it's possible but unfortunately it is just easier to move away from that hot mess."
783,2020-09-26 00:31:58,g5dpne,"What complete and utter piles of steaming excretion they sound like. Gtfo from there! In a way, you might be lucky to find they are the worst people you will ever have had to live with. I hope you never have to live with worse."

834,2020-04-20 21:51:58,g525v8," We need to be in prayer all day against this event led by Lady Gaga.💥💥💥

We need to pray extra on Saturday April 18th, pre and post the six hour show. This i will be a prime time of spiritual attack. This is why.
“ONE WORLD” TOGETHER AT HOME...
The satanic high priestess, Lady Gaga has teamed up with Global Citizen and WHO, along with tons of other 'idols'-including Billie Eilish and Keisha-to preform a HISTORIC '6 hour' long ritual with the whole world tuning in this coming Saturday. Satan just feeds off of this energy. This will be a time of heavy spiritual warfare!
They are calling on YOU to support
their 'ONE WORLD'...
""Curated in collaboration with Lady Gaga, featuring appearances from over 70 of the world’s leading artists, multiple host and Global Citizens like YOU!""
👉They want YOU to get involved here…..
""Take action now! 'Take the pledge, as a global citizen, I'm staying home!""⚠️
They will be pushing the masses to go to the 'Global Citizen' web page. On this page they have the same goals as the UN, WHO and Pope Francis. They want you to demand world leaders invest in vaccines, fight against poverty, inequality, climate change, etc. This is designed to get you to support a new ONE WORLD order for the 'COMMON GOOD of all'.
They want you to just sit back, immerse yourself and enjoy this RITUAL! As they send subliminal messages to you for 6 HOURS!!! This is all about MIND CONTROL....
""As Gaga explained while announcing the event last week, One World: Together at Home is not your traditional benefit concert: ""We want to raise the money before we go on air. When we do go on air, put your wallets away, your credit cards away, and ENJOY THE SHOW,"" she explained during an at-home live stream.""
It also seems like the number '6' is very popular with this pandemic….
🔸Keep '6 feet' away, social distancing
🔸 Netflix Pandemic documentary has '6 Episodes'
🔸According to the WHO definition, 'Phase 6' is a pandemic 🔸CDC unveils '6-phase' pandemic response blueprint
🔸The word Corona has '6 letter', simple gematria equals '66'
🔸Headline from AP news…""China didn’t warn public of likely pandemic for '6 key days'.
🔸Headline from NPR org ""WHO Sets '6 Conditions' For Ending A Coronavirus Lockdown""
🔸And now we have this '6 hour' ritual, not 3 hours or 4 hours but '6' long hours!
👉Remember what took place in Daniel 3, King Nebuchadnezzar made a statue for the people to bow down to that was '6' cubits high and '6' cubits wide. BUT before they bowed down, what happened first….. 🎼The MUSIC had to be played! Remember this is all spiritual. ⚔️
📖 ""Then the herald loudly proclaimed, “O PEOPLE of EVERY NATION and LANGUAGE this is what you are COMMANDED: As soon as you HEAR the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and all kinds of MUSIC,🎺 you must fall down and WORSHIP the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.""
I'll leave Daniel 3 in the comments for easy reference. There is nothing new under the sun.🌤
Music is powerful, and satan has been using it since the beginning of time to influence people. ""Studies have shown that different languages, tempos, tones, and sound levels of music can cause different effects on emotions, mental activities, and physical reactions."" We know this is true because people are paid well to put music to commercials and movies. And we know subliminal messages are often hidden in music.
These worldly artist (idols or stars) worship the god of this world. Don't be fooled, this is not about supporting our 'Healthcare Workers'. This is a World-Wide Satanic Ritual that is coming this Saturday. Getting you ready to accept this New World Order….
Keep watch!"

859,2020-04-20 21:59:20,g51yd2,Capture room reflections vs direct mic capsule sound. It would still pick up from rear just down many dB so most would come from the room. You’re gonna get different comb filtering (not in a bad way) from a point source and reflections. EQ response would be totally different with the time delay of reflections. Not sure how far that brick wall extends and what else is around the room. Some kind of effect I guess.

Same microphone, different branding.  Telefunken made the tubes and supplied them to Neumann in return for the right to sell the microphone under their own name."
888,2020-04-21 01:04:16,g51yd2,"While she might make some money these kinds of deals are rarely about be money. It would be an endorsement. She probably is using Neumann everything with her live show too. 

As an ad it's perfect. For most people theyvjust see the logo. The only people that would notice the 'mistake' would be the same people that even know the brand. Neumann is a legacy brand in a world of many more affordable options. 
By us talking about the 'mistake' we are reminding ourselves that Neumann is a top brand,  and seeing Taylor Swift (a top pop star) confirms the quality of the brand."

895,2020-04-20 22:59:59,g51yd2,"All these in-home recording sessions really show the benefits of a good studio environment. They should consider recording in a walk-in closet with clothes in it rather than a brick room with huge glass doors and a tile floor.  Could sound great, but often doesn't..."
896,2020-04-20 22:29:54,g51yd2,"Sadly, yes. Pre-Pro Tools.  Tape machines and razor blades.  Our studio had more than a dozen Neumann U67s and U87s, though.

Added... We couldn't swing the bucks for automation, either. Meaning you had to get the mix right at least once."
897,2020-04-22 06:16:17,g51yd2,"Yes, it's a U47.  Neumann and Telefunken worked together to design the microphone.  Telefunken designed the vacuum tubes and supporting circuitry and Neumann designed the capsule and related bits.

The earlier ones were made and sold by Telefunken with their badge on it.  After a few years Neumann took over production and those ones all have the Neumann badge.  So it's a bit nit-picky of me to say it's a Neumann U47 rather than a Telefunken U47 as they're almost exactly the same thing.

I should add that I've never used a U47, let alone owned one, so I'm only repeating what I've read... but I recall  George Martin saying it was his favourite microphone and he used it heavily in the Beatles recordings.  Apparently he preferred the Neumann version over the Telefunken so there is perhaps some subtle difference between the two."
898,2020-04-21 15:56:00,g51yd2,Sorry lady gaga. My point stands

But I just do not understand the hate. I don't care for her music as such but its a far cry from the downright *annoying* shit that many other artists of whatever gender produce. If her music were the most asinine lyrically and most repetitive musically pop music got, then the world would be a much better place. But sadly, it is not."

One of the themes I took from 1984 was being defined by your past or trying to run from it. 

I don't know if you can really boil every season down to one word. Several themes run throughout each season and that meme is all just based on something Jessica Lange casually said in an interview when we were only 2 seasons in."
1046,2020-05-02 22:40:07,gcejy1,"Apocalypse is purely fan service. I enjoyed the season for what it was but there’s nothing deeper about it

1984 has an underlying theme of your true self vs how you appear to the world. 

Rita was Donna who was more than a psychologist experimenting on people
 
Margret was hiding behind a facade of innocence and religion. 

Jingles was actually a decent man.

Ray wasn’t the model citizen he appeared to be. 

So on and so fourth"
1047,2020-05-03 18:16:41,gcejy1,"I took Apocalypse as having the theme of Redemption and falling from power. The whole season comes off as a power struggle between all of the characters. Constantly throughout the season the power relationships shift and twist.

As for 1984, the theme seemed to be more about truth and lies, honesty and dishonesty. All the characters had false identities and true ones."

1071,2020-05-02 23:35:04,gce7kj,"Her music is cute but this twee folksy indie-pop is kind of niche and artists like mxmtoon or even Zooey Deschanel feel like they'd eat up her fanbase. I just don't think music is what people want/expect from her. Like, if the average person heard Melissa Villsanor was coming to town and blindly bought a ticket and then she sang instead of doing a standup routine they'd probably be disappointed. If she wanted to she could probably do some cabaret/nightclub/coffee shop style shows at select venues though, maybe open for a larger act."
1072,2020-05-03 00:09:55,gce7kj,I liked her when she was on America's Got Talent like 10 years ago. She's pretty hilarious.
1073,2020-05-03 11:55:21,gce7kj,I'd love to hear her work in a genre that doesn't sound like Regina Spektor could have done it and work with top notch vocal producers. [She does great covers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D80e-duGvQ0) though!

We are not okay. I'm a teacher and I made 4 home visits--with mask and gloves and without entering their homes-- this week to check on some of our at-risk kids. The instant they opened the door, each kid, in 4 different houses, said the exact same words: ""Miss Davis, I wish I could HUG YOU!"" --and these are 6TH GRADERS!! My response four times was, ""Me too, baby. Me too."" It's just so hard. Hugger, or not. It's still so hard. Hang in there. You're in good company.

I went to look at the Instagram photo you mentioned.  It wouldn’t surprise me if they are playing loose with the rules.

Hopefully, Elton will do well with the new releases."
1119,2020-05-02 19:03:09,gbn11k,"It's possible that content was from before the stay at home order. Time between writing/recording and release is usually months for songs, sometimes years. And if they met before the social distancing orders to record, the photo was probably taken back then as well. 

But then again, I have no idea. I just don't think we should jump to any conclusions."

I follow Charlie, and he had two IG stories of him wearing the same outfit (brown tee and white long sleeves) that were uploaded like 15-20 hours before the Elton post. So, I'd say it's too coincidental for him to be wearing the same clothes in his stories and post in less than 24 hours..."

I think that would count as ""flex"" music. I think a lot in the modern day can probably be linked back to *My Adidas* by Run-D.M.C. That songs seems like a real watershed moment for flex music."

1131,2020-05-02 18:40:02,gbmz6m,"America is a consumerist, capitalistic environment, and most Americans (sadly) base their worth on their material goods. So it was only a matter of time before music started to either reflect what was going on, and/or directly influence what was going on. 

You definitely see it take a shift after the hippie 60s. Sex started to be rock and rolls thing, Money and Power for the Funk/Disco/Baby hip hop scene. Teamed up with record execs that wanted to play what was popular and controversial over what was actually good, you had a hard lean into flex culture at the end of the 70s.

Bring in 90s/2000s era hip hop, and it was essentially over for us all.

Thanks for this post. Was talking with some friends on how consumery music has become over the last years. Buy this, spend that, I have this here, obnoxious car sitting over there. Its... tiring. lmao."

1133,2020-05-01 21:32:38,gbmz6m,"I'd say the prevalence in social media gave it a massive boost. The concept of social media allows you to put yourself into direct comparison with your peers. Whatever we can do to get a step up on other people, and wealth and materialistic items are tangible things that we can instantly point to and go ""oh that guy is wearing a $5000 watch, he must be better than this poor sack of shit over here!"""

1137,2020-05-03 01:28:59,gbmz6m,"I wouldn't really call *Back in the USSR* a flex song.

I feel like there is a rather fine line between self awareness and just having a laugh about it when it comes to flex music. It also depends on the artist's image and how *serious* they are viewed as.

*I'm the Greatest*, written by John Lennon for Ringo might be an appropriate example. If John had sung this song, a fraction of people would've totally viewed it in serious light and not as a fun track it was written as. Ringo's goofy and fun image meant it was only viewed as a fun track. As John said

>I couldn’t sing it, but it was perfect for Ringo. He could say ‘I’m the greatest’ and people wouldn’t get upset. Whereas if I said ‘I’m the greatest,’ they’d all take it so seriously.

Oasis' *Be Here Now* could actually be considered a flex album for different reasons. They knew they were at the top of the world and it has that exact production, millions of long and extravagant coke fueled guitars layers. Some tracks, like the title track, *My Big Mouth*, *I Hope I Think I Know*, *D'You Know What I Mean* and *The Fame* could be considered borderline flex for the sake of the argument, but for the right reasons."
1138,2020-05-04 11:50:16,gbmz6m,"Ok, what's the most common teenage dream? Being free, partying all day, having a lot of sex, not giving a fuck about what authorities say to you.

What is the next step of this? Being ultra rich and ultra famous so you can party even harder, party across the world, party in your Lambo, party with models.

I think the flex song is an evolution of the ""I wanna party"" or ""I wanna be free"" songs, and the ""rockstar life"" image of the past decades. Like Kiss's ""Rock and Roll All Nite"".

Maybe the world also became more consumerist thanks to capitalism, and more image-driven thanks to social media. So the songs became less of ""I wanna be free"" and more ""I wanna be ultra-rich"". But the core desire of being able to party hard all day, free of responsibilities, still stands."

1145,2020-05-03 13:43:08,gbmz6m,John is very right here. People would be so up his ass if he actually sung it but with Ringo they will just find it amusing.

This culture of showing off your valuables and your titles was something very small in society. Now everybody does it. You even had Obama, the president of the US, drop the mic, and engage a little bit in flex culture, and I can go on and on about the current President. 

Now you had songs like “Diamonds are a girls best friend” by Marilyn Monroe in those early days, but before that, this culture of peacocking was very very limited."

And the rest is F-L-Y,
You see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix,
And these reasons I'll tell you why.
You see, I'm six foot one, and I'm tons of fun
When I dress to a T,
You see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali
And I dress so viciously.
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars
That definitely ain't the wack,
I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunroof Cadillac.
So after school I take a dip in the pool,
Which is really on the wall,
I got a colour TV, so I can see
The Knicks play basketball. Hear me talk about

we sure about that, or....

i'm finding it kinda difficult to believe that braggadocio and the mentality behind it is something new, either in society generally or just music. people have been showing off about the shit they've got since they've been able to communicate.

but, if we're ignoring that plot hole, i'd imagine it recently stems from hip hop culture, and how it attracts people from worse off/impoverished areas yet has virtually no ceiling on profits. with the amount of money some of those guys make i'd probably want to flex too tbh. so would you."

1284,2020-06-25 19:33:45,hfrnnr,what the hell!!!!!! I love her!!!!! an artist!!!!! that's beautiful. I love a concept album. I had no idea melodrama was one. I do know that my favorite song on melodrama is supercut without a doubt - literal perfection in every sense of the word
1285,2020-06-25 19:40:24,hfrnnr,"yeah it is pretty much a concept album!! and wow the taste you have, supercut is one of my favorites off the album too (and possibly one of my favorite songs ever). i just never get tired of listening to it, the whole album has held up so well over the years"
1286,2020-06-25 19:09:56,hfrkjz,"This is incredible! I have been a huge fan of billboard chart videos since 2013 and this is great to see. First thing I did was check the video for my birthweek. Second thing i did was view the November 2, 2013 video because it was the one week Alison Gold - Chinese Food charted."
1287,2020-06-25 19:32:58,hfrkjz,"This is a great idea! The links don’t seem to work for me, though - all I get is [this](https://imgur.com/a/Qn8jK9O). Am I doing something wrong?"

1290,2020-06-26 01:12:36,hfrkjz,I must now start a change.org petition to make November 2nd a national holiday
1291,2020-06-25 20:23:47,hfrkjz,"Yeah the streaming function seems to not work quite right.

I got it working by doing a right-click save-as on computer or similar function on iOS"
1292,2020-06-25 17:09:37,hfplbs,I take anything kpop fans say with a grain of salt because they’re always overly harsh with anything BP put out.
1293,2020-06-25 17:16:19,hfplbs,"The song is massively successful, that means vast majority of people liked it. Those who didn't fall into two camps - music is subjective so those who genuinely didn't like it, and antis. Those who just didn't like it don't care about it, those who go makes 10 posts on Twitter about how bad it is are antis.

Don't worry about it, any famous song will always people who it didn't click with. Only two things matter - is it successful and does it work for you. That's it.

For me personally Sour Candy was a Gaga level song, not necessarily a BP level song which I hold in very high regards. It wasn't any better or worse that most songs on Chromatica, a very decent song but nothing mind blowing. BP's parts were actually the best thing about the song, so that's great. And it was very successful which helped introduce BP to new audience, that's all it needed to do."
1294,2020-06-25 17:16:07,hfplbs,I loved it personally but I’m a huge Lady Gaga fan. I just wish there was more to it. A chorus would have been awesome.
1295,2020-06-25 17:10:38,hfplbs,At least they streamed it 😜 haters gonna hate
1296,2020-06-25 16:58:45,hfplbs,I think a chorus would've made the song better. But its still good. A very famous person on youtube called it the best song of the week. The same person who rated Rain on Me as meh.
1297,2020-06-25 17:17:16,hfplbs,"It's like with any song. Some people are going to like it, some are going to hate it. But like someone said, when it comes to Kpop, haters (of any group) are going to be vicious against all songs of certain groups. Just the way kpop is."
1298,2020-06-25 17:33:20,hfplbs,Those haters are streaming BP's music just so they can criticise the group. Thanks for the stream I guess??
1299,2020-06-25 22:12:46,hfplbs,"I don't dislike the song. But I do feel there is a sudden disconnect in transition from the BP part to Gaga's part of the song. The flow is not smooth. Gaga's part and BP part sound like 2 different song.  
Would have loved to hear the gaga part from one of the girls."
1300,2020-06-25 23:18:21,hfplbs,That’s very true
1301,2020-06-26 00:03:22,hfplbs,"It literally sampled a house song. Whether you like it not it’s a house track . Just because it’s not big room house doesn’t mean it’s not edm. 

The entire album is house beats"
1302,2020-06-26 06:51:30,hfplbs,"All I've heard, from Gaga fans, is that it should be much longer. They love it. I've never hear anything negative about the song itself, just that it's too short."
1303,2020-06-25 23:25:42,hfplbs,Very true
1304,2020-06-25 23:23:26,hfplbs,I had no clue it was successful I thought they would’ve tried to find a way to make a video for it to make it bigger and everything I see and hear is negative. But if it’s doing well that’s great!
1305,2020-06-25 21:32:15,hfplbs,Agreed!
1306,2020-06-25 23:25:06,hfplbs,I thought it did have chorus. Maybe I’m thinking it is and it’s actually not since I honestly don’t know that seem into music.
1307,2020-06-25 23:26:07,hfplbs,That’s great!
1308,2020-06-25 23:19:21,hfplbs,That’s true
1309,2020-06-25 23:21:32,hfplbs,"Yea very true but I feel bad seeing so much hate on it they are a good fit and think it should get a video, I feel like it would do really good"
1310,2020-06-25 23:15:52,hfplbs,Yea! That would’ve been a cool thing to hear.
1311,2020-06-26 01:44:15,hfplbs,So is everyone pop song including most of blackpinks music lol

So last Friday was the three-year anniversary of the Popheads charts; on June 26th, 2017 the sub ran its first chart which you can find the post of [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/6jp354/the_popheads_weekly_hot_40_chart_week_of_june_26/). To mark the occasion, I’m currently working on some year-end countdown videos. The [2017 year-end video](https://youtu.be/Wy6Hv44yE-U) (compiled by /u/DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy from users’ top songs for the year on last.fm) is up now. I was hoping to have the 2018 and 2019 ones done by now but I haven’t been able to complete them just yet, they’ll be up in the coming days and I’ll share them soon.

I’ve also made a revamped [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/charts) for the charts, featuring various records relating to the charts which I hope to keep up to date.

Onto records and achievements:

* Dua Lipa’s ‘Physical’ becomes the first song released in 2020 to spend 20 weeks on the chart. There are a couple of currently-charting tracks just behind it: Lady Gaga’s ‘Stupid Love’ at 19 weeks and Rina Sawayama’s ‘XS’ at 17.

* Two artists make their first appearance on the chart this week: American singer/rapper Ashnikko with ‘[Cry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pssWSj42t8M)’ featuring Grimes at #24, and British artist SG Lewis who’s credited for producing and co-writing ‘[Experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yeohq-Fapks)’ with Victoria Monét and Khalid at #38."

Singer: Blaine
Season: 4
Scenario: Kurt and Blaine have broken up and are starting to talk again, Blaine tells Kurt he wants him back but by this point Kurt is already dating Adam. Obviously Blaine is feeling pretty sad and we might see some flashback scenes while he emotionally sings in the auditorium. 
Side note: I was convinced they were actually going to sing this in the show and are still mad they didn’t. 

Song: Shallow
Singer: Tina with either Artie or Sam
Season: 4
Scenario: In my made up rewritten plot for s4 Tina became a diva much earlier on, to assert dominance- she thought she needed to be a combination of Rachel/Mercedes/Santana so she wouldn’t be overlooked. However it backfired and almost everyone avoided her, she also created this reputation through her attitude rather than rely on her singing (so people keep underestimating her talent). Either Artie or Sam tried to convince the rest of the club it’s all an act but they were still unsure so he convinced them to go and hide in the auditorium later. He also gets Tina to come to the auditorium where they have a little heart to heart before they start singing. The glee club are blown away by both Tinas softer side and her singing. After they’ve finished Tina finally gets the recognition she deserves and learns she can be a new kind of female lead. 

Song: Marvin Gaye
Singers: Quinn and Puck
Season: 6
Scenario: Just a fun performing at Santana and Brittanys wedding. Everyone expected them to sing something sweet/romantic but considering the sexual history between the four of them this felt more appropriate."

Scenario: Sees Brittany with Sam and realizing she's maturing and she doesn't need her anymore

Shallow

Lead Singer: Im changing it to a group number, includes Tina, Blaine, Joe, Rory, Sugar, Sam, and Artie

Backup Singers: None, their voices shouldn't overlap, it should be about their personal experiences

Season: 3

Lead Singer: Madison from Season 6

Backup Singers: Jane and Allistair

Season: 6, obviously

Lead Singer: Rory, he could sing this perfectly ngl

Backup Singer: Sugar

Season: 3

Scenario: Rory starts to fall in love with Sugar and is finally feeling depth and friendship in his life, feeling at home in america. Sugar sings the meghan trainor part perfectly, connecting to an emotional level and realizing most of her previous friends have come from money.

Season and Episode: Either Season 4 The Break Up or Glease or Diva.

Scenario: Finn sees Rachel and Brody are getting close and feels replaced in the Break-up episode. 
For Glease, he knows that he isn't the most important man in Rachel's life but could also be a warning to Brody that he knows he has made mistakes and will be ready to fight to win Rachel back.
In Diva, Finn could be depressed and there could be a scene where Finn sees pictures of Brody and Rachel in Facebook which he could be singing the song over. Maybe there could have been a comment that could have made Finn upset and resentful which could lead onto the coffee scene in I Do. I feel that the song was a missed opportunity for the show to do."

Artie realizes that he majorly fucked up by letting Tina go. He sees how happy she is with Mike and can’t stand to see it. He sings this song in the choir room, which makes for an uncomfortable moment for Tina and Mike.


Song: Everywhere

Sung By: Rachel

No Back Up

Season 5


Rachel has been taking Finn’s death very hard. To self soothe, she starts singing as that has always brought her the most joy and it’s what brought she and Finn together. She starts singing a stripped down, acoustic version while she’s alone in her apartment and she has a mental montage of all the sweet moments she had with Finn.


Song: Marvin Gaye

Sung By: Mercedes and Sam

No Back Up

Season 5


Mercedes decides to stop practicing “no sex before marriage “ because she realizes that having sex prior to that doesn’t make her a “bad person”. She also is very attracted to Sam and doesn’t think that it’s fair to make him wait it out. She confides in Sam about her changed views and he respects them and tries to hide his excitement. They plan a special date night later that day, but leading up to it, they sing this song as they’re going about their day, leading up to their special night."

1458,2020-06-29 23:47:41,hia1hw,"I think they’re fully aware that they could sign to a label, bundle and release a more GP friendly song for “better” results. So, in my opinion, they’re not stupid. They’re stubborn maybe and they have a lot of pride in how they’ve come to be where they are. 

I think BH/BTS want success on their terms without compromising. If they sign to an American label they will have to play by their rules. If they bundle their album, they will have huge numbers, but every media outlet will write about how they reached it because of bundles, similarly to how they always bring up the multiple album versions. 

I think the fandom is very split about the whole thing. Some people want them to continue as they are so that if we get the no. 1 on BB 100, it’s more organic. Others want BTS to give into the methods of the industry to get as far as they can. Personally, I just want them to remain true to themselves, wherever that leads them.

Plus, maybe ON was just the type of song they wanted to make. I’m never going to forget Namjoon’s album vlive when he said that even if you don’t like it, MOTS: 7 is them. So I think they know there are ways they could be more successful in regards to numbers and GP acceptance. I don’t think that’s their brand though. Also, they already have huge success. BH is a business so of course they want to make money, but they also want a certain reputation and legacy."
1459,2020-06-29 23:12:30,hia1hw,[deleted]
1460,2020-06-30 02:19:42,hia1hw,"I remember I saw somewhere a video clip. 

Jungkook said ON wasn't going to be the title track (nor was that the name of the song but he suggested it to be called ON) because they saw that ON was the opposite than N.O.  and they choose it to reference one of his earlier albums.

They were really focused on putting across the concept of the album over anything.

If they were to focus on getting public friendly songs it would be so easily to make BWL 2.0 and BWL 3.0 and we have seen how that goes.

Also, signing with a american label may have its conditions. They talked about it around 2017, they were offered contracts that demanded 'changes' from them in exchange of heavy publicity and success. They declined.

Signing with a American Label can really screw you up, look at what is happening with Normani. It's easy to see the few spoiled artists they push but what about all the others that get sabotaged by their label? like, just by delaying your comeback, they can really screw you up, not to mention their intervention in your music, BTS let it slide one of the conditions was to sing in English and they just don't want it?

They have spend all 2019 and this 2020 talking about how happy they are with their current success, they obviously wanted to prioritise something different than public friendliness at this point. Something more fulfilling to them, I don't think they just do the opposite of what everyone expects just for the sake of being resilient.

Finally, NO, that's not stupid, when you are able to work on what you love, it's more intelligent to take the path that will keep you happy and passionate on your craft rather than taking any job promotion than will ruin the fun for you. Being in love with your job, people don't often experience that, you don't just ruin it."
1461,2020-06-30 00:39:54,hia1hw,"Signing with a US label means giving up a part of their creative freedom. 

“Frankly, **we** **could’ve** **gone** **higher**, had the chances, but instead of dreaming again for something bigger, I want to laugh and be happy, even if it’s a little slower, a little slower, I want to make music with our BTS for a long, long time.” -Kim **Taehyung**, Bring the Soul, 2018

I'm assuming this meant that they could sign with a US label or make music that appeals to the masses or bundles. They tried to get more radio play with friendlier songs like boy with luv, but radio djs have explicitly stated that they wont play them because they're Korean and bh obviously is not going to throw money for play listing. It didn't work, so they stopped. 

Why is it so strange to people that they don't really care about the fame they just want to make music and art. I remember people giving them shit because they didnt like the 7 promotion strategy with funding art exhibits. It wasn't intended to appeal to everyone nor was it intended to boost sales, maybe some members like RM genuinely love and want to fund artists"
1462,2020-06-30 00:36:21,hia1hw,"I dont mind the way they’re going. They have strong promo, tv shows, radio interviews, etc. a lot of the things you mentioned while it helps, it doesn’t at the same time. I keep up with western artists and the things you mentioned are called out by western fans, and even artists. Bundling yeah sure it helps for records, and sales but that’s about it. The GP does not give a shit about how much albums sell, and it doesn’t have an impact on songs being played. And bundling is called out all the time, you have western stans who drag each other through mud on who did it worse. 

For playlisting and radioplay big hit did as much as they can by going to radio sponsored shows and interviews, they didn’t get spins. US labels use payola to get so many spins from top artists and it’s known, artists call it out, fans know who does it because it’s impossible to hide it. I wouldnt want anyone I listen to use payola just to get numbers up it’s a dirty borderline illegal tactic. 

I’m sure big hit doesn’t want to sign to a US label because yes, they will lose freedom. Look at all the artists who want to release music but they can’t, look at all the artists who have issues with their masters and rights to their own music not even including the money factors. 

There’s a lot going on in the US music industry that a lot of people don’t know about unless they’re really involved with western artists and a lot of people don’t know that. Imagine what’s behind closed doors that only artists know about? Or labels?"
1463,2020-06-30 01:07:51,hia1hw,"I think the problem lies in that BTS (and BigHit) seem to want different things to some of the fans. I don't think they necessarily want to be mainstream in the US or the west, they just want a strong fandom with buying power.

Something Taehyung once said in one of their documentaries has always stuck wiht me. It's the line about having had opportunities to advance and become bigger quicker, but choosing to not take these because they don't want to lose sight of themselves and remain happy. I'm not sure if all the things you're talking about would achieve that for them when you consider everything they would have to do and potentially give up for it to happen.

I understand that it's frustrating as a fan, but i also think fans need to learn to be less selfish when it comes to their faves careers. I often see many fans with this fantasy of what success should or could be for their faves, but this fantasy often completely disregards the group itself and their wishes.

There are a lot of technicalities with the things you mention (i.e. how bundles are almost always a loss for the company just to be able to see an artificial number on the charts (also they did try bundles for their first stadium concert in the US but ultimately dedcided it was not advantageous i presume), how signing with a US label would be giving up control over certain aspects of their careers as well as income, financial losses through payola (a highly sketchy industry practice that i wish someone would seriously expose and end already) etc). It's a nuanced and complicated issue to the point where i think it's too simplistic to just say ""look at all the fame they could gain if they did it the standard way"" if you don't take into account all of the things they as artists, a company and people could lose.  

The boys have said countless times how proud and happy they are with ON and MOTS: 7, so honestly i think it might just be the type of music they want to make (regardless of the US trends). That's ultimately what i want for them, to be able to do the music and send out the messages that they want. If they can't do that then i as a fan feel like their material success is meaningless.

I hope this made some sense, i wrote it in a hurry but i wanted to get some of my thoughts out before going to bed v-v"
1464,2020-06-30 05:39:33,hia1hw,"It is incredibly simple. They want to do whatever they want however the want to do it. That's personally very respectable and perfectly ok.

The guys and bighit felt like creating ON so they did that's it. They have enough pressure on them, signing with a US label would only make them feel restrained and I'm sure they don't want that. Bighit and bts sure like to go slow but steady. Nothing wrong with that at all."
1465,2020-06-29 23:43:47,hia1hw,They got lucky and it shows. You can't expect them to move like a well established company that makes calculated moves because that's just not what they are. They're making it up as they go along.
1466,2020-06-30 15:34:59,hia1hw,"Didn't people complain they were becoming too westernized and public friendly post 2017.

They're not being stupid. They're just not taking any shortcuts by hopping on the trend or signing a US label and releasing an English album. Let them do what they want."
1467,2020-06-30 01:11:38,hia1hw,"Truthfully, Tik Tok is changing the music industry and it’s uncharted territory for all artists. The app is changing the game because majority of today’s hits come from unknown artists. Lil Nas, Doja Cat, Roddy Rich, Meghan the Stallion, Joji have all risen to popularity due to their songs going viral on Tik Tok. 

Teenagers have always had the biggest influence on what is popular in Western culture and Tik Tok proves it. I think BTS and BigHit might have signed with a US label but now what’s the point. Record labels can influence radio spins and charts but viral TikTok hits happen organically and if an artist tries persuade ppl to make videos to their song it will backfire. For example, Justin Bieber was ROASTED on the app for trying to make his new songs become the new “Tik Tok dance”. 

Fans have a lot of power and can help their favorites chart which is how BTS entered Billboard at #4 with On but then dropped to #67 and fell off the charts completely by week 3. Same thing happened with Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber’s new song. 

I think BigHit realizes even with a fandom as large as BTS’s they will never be mainstream and have come to terms with it since they are still successful. To me it seems as if they are focusing on music they want to produce and their loyal fans which is exactly how it should be."
1468,2020-06-29 23:12:05,hia1hw,"I think you’re forgetting that BTS are still KPOP artists, and as for hopping on the western trend, maybe they like freedom in making their music? We all know how bts are involved in their music making so ofc they would make music that they like or prefer. Also we know how bts gets so much slack for westernizing, and I think bts is also aware of this, so if they hopped on the trend... I don’t even know what would happen.  And the other things are just bighits marketing problem ig, and bts has little control over. No company is perfect"
1469,2020-06-29 23:09:25,hia1hw,This is an actually interesting unpopular opinion.  Especially as Yoongi says he just wants to make commercially successful music and that *7* is influenced by current trends.

1471,2020-06-30 11:37:48,hia1hw,i don't know why they are releasing non gp friendly songs like idol and On when they are trying to break into US chart and bts members themselves want to chart high in BB hot 100. Nobody will spin these kinds of songs in 2020 except their loyal fanbase who will eat anything up BTS release. On spends only 2 weeks on hot 100  which means it’s only fandom driven while bwl has more longevity and gp interest.The only reason On chart higher than BWL is because of two versions which boosts a lot of sales and streams in first week and free fall next week. I bet there will be no way On could chart higher than BWL without two versions. As an example BLACKPINK fanbase is no where as big as bts but they have so many casual listeners and gp interest cauz their songs are easy to access to general public.They’ll only realize that Gp interest is also important when BLACKPINK coming for their position in US with August and September comeback with small US fanbase.

You realize artists loose money when the bundle. It's like why lose money just to say your album is the best selling of the year?

But I do agree on making at least one song targeting the U.S. I think people get mad whenever it's mentioned that they'd benefit from making a song in English or that's half English bc it's appealing to the ""west"" but they make Japanese songs and none of them are fluent in Japanese. I think even BTS feels like they don't wanna do a full English bc it'd feel like ""selling out"" but again what about their Japanese releases... nowadays Japan isn't even as strong a fanbase as the US so it's weird that they appeal to Japanese fans so much with Japanese releases, fanmeets, special fancafe, but god forbid they appeal to American fans..."

Even tho I'm an big army and I see myself staying with them till I die (without being delulu), I think BTS/BH are trying too hard to stick to the ""different from the others"" type and the deep things.

1476,2020-06-30 00:06:21,hia1hw,"I think what it comes down to is that no one expected BTs to take off the way they did, **least of all Big Hit.** (I envision BTS as a runaway dog and Bang PD holding onto the leash while being dragged behind like an old grandma lmao)

I feel like most of the decisions they make are reactive to the current climate and not in anticipation of what the market will be by the time their ideas come to fruition. Fans/the market decide on what they want and then Big Hit produces it, often a little too late to properly capitalize on the situation. This goes for merch, webtoons, games, etc.

The only way I can see people coming to respect Idol music is if they get people to see that either;

**A)** They can do what western artists do (sometimes even better) Such as Blackpink who have always had a much more international/western-friendly vibe) and Monsta X's English album.

or

**B)** play into the Korean part of k-pop so that it sets them apart from everyone. Acknowledge and play up that they are different from all other current acts and in doing so gain respect for it.

And to me, the problem is they never really commit, they only ever go halfway. Fake Love/DNA was a good setup for the first approach but then comes Idol and BwL which was hard-carried by Halsey. And then MOTS7 just confuses me for this reason. They established that the album was made with current western music trends in mind, went hard on the promotions in North America and Europe, and yet it doesn't sound like anything that's being released in the west or in Korea.

It seems to me like BH is just focusing on creating more obsessive fans for BTS than actually helping legitimize the genre and gain respect for the artistry. This way they get more money in the immediate future rather than invest in themselves long-term."

I'll never forget in that one docu-series (can't remember which one it was, the first or second) where Taehyung flat out said they had been presented with opportunities to advance at a much quicker pace and things that would make them much bigger but that they chose to decline these things because it didn't feel right. I think he said they wanted to remain happy first and foremost (implying that whatever it was would put a strain on them and compromise their autonomy).

I think they made the right choice, especially when you consider how much they were struggling mentally as a group with their fame in 2017/2018. Fans are often very selfish when it comes to their faves careers, and they often disregard what the people they support themselves want or need simply to fulfill their own fantasies of success. I don't think it's done with bad intentions but i often see it happen and honestly much of ARMYs push of BTS' advancement feels like this to me."
1484,2020-06-30 04:06:26,hia1hw,I agree! I remember this one live they shot after the grammys where Yoongi was talking about being patient while hoping for a grammy nomination. BTS are really all about organic growth and going on their own pace.

And if they just wanted to make music for themselves then why do they keep chasing media opportunities around the US for random inconsequential appearances at iheart shows and brunches. It was never necessary before, and I am sure they would much prefer to spend less time traveling for appearances and more time perfecting their skills and music since performing for their fans is their passion as they say it is.

Nevermind the way they always go on about wanting a Grammy next.

Isn't it more likely that BH and BTS are at odds with what they want from the group?"

Taehyung mentioned in Break the Silence that they got opportunities to expand to new heights but they declined cause it didn't feel right .......probably because it meant giving up a part of their artistic freedom .

I don't think BH or BTS are that stupid to not realise that putting out songs like ON which have LONG (5- 6 mins ) MV'  will help them with numbers when pop culture is shifting  towards shorter length songs and MV' . They even did the same for TXT' MV . 

BTS even mentioned how their music is influenced by what they listen to . Suga even admitted in a recent mots 7 interview that they do keep up with the trends . My perspective on this is that while they like to keep up with trends , they don't mean completely applying the same formulas to their songs .

For mots 7 or particularly ON  the only thing that I can say I would consider anything close to being trendy is the usage of trap beats."

Mots7 definitely wasn’t made with the purpose of producing mega hits, it just felt like genuine self expression. Like you said, BH is very capable of analyzing trends, they could’ve churned out the typical top 40 style songs and seen more commercial success, but they chose to put songs like Respect and ON in the album, lol. Like i said, that either very stupid, or just deliberate. I’m leaning more on the deliberate.

I think my wording may have suggested that i leaned on the “bh is stupid” side than the “bts/bh are resistant to industry’s rules”, i kinda tried to be unbiased. But personally, i also believe that bts are just doing whatever they want to do (but saying that and giving them that much credit would’ve gotten me ate up in the replies lol, so i remained neutral). 

I’m one of those rare people who don’t think BH is terrible lol. They have their issues obviously, as any huge company would, but i think their core is *good*. I know Bang PD is seen as a villain by a lot of people, but in my very personal opinion (as someone who’s been following bts since predebut) he genuinely cares and loves the group. I’m sure he cares about money and recognition too and he definitely has pushed bts to their limits, but i mostly see him as a mentor figure than someone who forces bts to do things they don’t want to do."
1497,2020-06-30 00:12:51,hia1hw,"It's interesting because MOTS:7 actually did have western trends in mind, just the wrong decade imo. It sounds like what you might've heard on the radio in the early 2010s."

MOTS7 did something that no other kpop album has done, it got really good critic reviews, it's much more respected than anything they got from previous releases. That is 100% a sign of they artistry being recognised. A lot of the critics talk abut the lyrics because they were heavily involved on them and now they are going for the production side of it.

You believe the album did nothing because you see fandom gossiping but how much of this comes across for the artist? All they see is professional critics and as the year finishes, if you take a look at the best selling albums worldwide and then at their scores, MOTS7 shines like a diamond. In my opinion, there is no confusion about what approach they wanted to take here and how it is slowly working."
1499,2020-06-30 01:18:15,hia1hw,"Huh, i've always thought TXT were well managed. Their promotions are good and effective but doesn't overwork them. I think debut with follow up release + one comeback + japanese promotions in the first year of debut is pretty good. They're also constantly expanding the types of promotions they do which keeps things interesting and fresh as a fan.

They had some unfortunate things happen (they all got sick one after the other) last year that pushed their comeback a lot, but that was out of BigHit's control and i would rather they let them recover than perform sick and endanger the artist and others. Also, in the end i think it ended up benefitting them as well because all the bandwagon fans ended up leaving when things took so long to get rolling again. They were left with a core fanbase that has doubled since."

1501,2020-06-30 00:49:36,hia1hw,"No they're not, it's not a label deal and they're not listed as artists under the label. It's only a distribution deal which is vastly different."
1502,2020-06-30 10:41:08,hia1hw,"Nope, they have a distribution deal with Columbia.

In general, there are two types of contracts, a record deal and a distribution deal.

A record deal is when the label signs an artist and provides basically everything fort them, including marketing and advertisement, management, recording services, etc. 

An example of a record deal in the US for korean artists are Monsta X and Blackpink. And the effects of the deal is pretty evident.

Blackpink’s new song instantly entered the Top 10 on spotify’s biggest playlist (Today’s Top Hits), without the song having time to become a Top Hit. For comparison, none of the recent bts singles have made it into the top of the playlist (whereas their songs with western artists got really high placements). 

For MX, they released a full english album and had a really really impressive run on the radio, most likely due to the radio push (the song was great, but i don’t think it would’ve seen as much success on the radio without a label push). 


But distribution deal is... well, a distribution deal. They only deal with the retail side of things and aid in distributing the albums in US stores. 

Colombia currently has no involvement with bts aside from getting their albums from point A to point B."

> And no they can produce any sort of song but they will never be a hit with GP.

I have to disagree. Most songs that are considered hits aren’t genuine hits. If it takes a song weeks at the top of the biggest spotify playlists, top spots on the radio (for example, Dua Lipa, Justin Bieber, Doja Cat, have had radio audiences go up over 100M; The Weeknd’s audience numbers were in 150M). Bug labels are forcibly hand feeding GP these songs and without all that, majority of them wouldn’t have become hits. That’s a fact. 

Bts already has a mega fanbase that can promote the hell out of these songs; them releasing an english song (like Monsta X) and signing with a US label (radio+spotify push) could very easily get them a hit song. As long as all it takes for a song to become a hit is curated playlists and radios, BTS’ (and many others’) lack of hits can’t be blamed on their lack of appeal. In my opinion at least


> And IMO, BTS has already westernised their music a lot. They don't need to anymore. Their original sound was much better.
 
Genuine question - how is the current bts more westernized than bts from their early days..? It’s hard to get more specifically US influenced than hiphop, because hiphop is one of the current genres that was absolutely born in the US, whereas much of the modern day music is influenced by many many other genres. 

Bts’ hiphop concept made them as western as they could get. They never had the classic kpop sound like f(x) or idk, nct (maybe?), their music was always western to me, even the production in many of their earlier songs. 

Even better, i think they have gotten much closer to their korean roots lately, with extensive usage and representation of korean culture and especially korean instruments, as seen in Idol (traditional chants, instruments, hanboks), Black Swan and Ddaeng (traditional korean instruments) and the latest, Daechwita, with a lot of korean culture packed into it (instrumentation, the history behind the word ‘daechwita’, the music video, etc). Don’t see many western (OR korean) artists doing that. 

But each to their own i guess, i respect your opinion, despite disagreeing with it."
1506,2020-06-30 02:43:34,hia1hw,"I think with recent releases the American GP is getting more and more familiar with BTS' music, at least a certain cohort. Especially with social media platforms and edits, people are getting more access to BTS' music than through traditional platforms such as radio etc. And seeing as how the fanbase is continually growing - I think there was quite a striking increase this year in the number of new fans, especially in the West - I would disagree that their music is circumscribed to the fanbase.

Now, do I think BTS and their music is expected to get the attention or consideration as a household-name artist? Probably not, but that speaks less of their artistry, and more of the ignorance and biased behaviour of the Western music industry and many consumers. And I won't touch on One Direction too much, but there is a discrepancy to be noted between 1D and BTS (or any other Korean group). Secondly, most of the GP didn't get into 1D's music - it may seem that way with radio and playlisting, but those are just inflations.

>there is only a certain demography that you can appeal with BTS' and BH is doing really well in appealing that demography.

Statistics and compiled data has shown that BTS' fanbase looks more like a bell curve, maybe with a slight skew to the left. Agewise, many are ""youth/young adults"" but there are also a high number of individuals who are in their late adulthood. The appeal is there for their music and it's not exclusive to a certain demographic - from what I have seen and personally experienced, the ""concentrated demographic"" is more likely due to hesitation ""to actively keep up with a boyband in one's later years"" than a case of ""they don't appeal to me"".

Your perspective is valued though 😊

1507,2020-07-01 04:19:01,hia1hw,"It was very talked about some months ago but even her fan's complains have started to die down :(
Basically, she started to release some singles that got attention. They were very spaced and barely promoted tho, she basically got attention because of her potential. 
Her biggest release was 'Motivation' and was a good breakthrough song (one year ago). There was enough buzz to release another good single and then a debut album but then, nothing?
I think she got an average collab, arranged by her company and barely promoted, you know it's the type of think that tarnish your hype more than helping.
She said she has being working on the album but it's been 2 years since her first single... basically they killed the hype that was surrounding her. They literally will have to do everything all over again. She is very talented and they wasted it! 
This is just one case out of many, at this point its a bit clear that this happens to a lot of POC artist and kpop itself has had similar cases, think of CL too!"
1508,2020-06-30 01:15:22,hia1hw,"When I say freedom I mean doing what they want to do, the music they want to do, and working on their own music. Schedules for deadlines are for a reason, promo needs to be planned, production for albums, and tours. On the other hand there’s been artists on the American side begging for their music to released, and it could go on for years which effects the fan base and the popularity they have. Another label Victory records messed up a band and when they were good to leave they made them release 1 or two more albums before they could and a huge lawsuit happened. There’s been instances where they have to work with an other artist even if they don’t want to. 

We have no idea what happens when the members leave, we don’t know what happens to the rights on their names  and it’s an assumption of what people think they know. If it’s as bad as people try to make it out to be I dont think they would’ve thought about disbanding, it wouldn’t have been discussed because they would’ve been essentially forced right? All we know is that they were ready, and they resigned. They read their contracts we didn’t. 

At this point there’s no way Big hit hasn’t been approached by a US label. I can guarantee the contract had something in it that Bh/bts were against. Taehyung even said himself that they had chances of getting higher."
1509,2020-06-30 10:20:15,hia1hw,"Can we confidently say that they don’t own their masters tho? 

With T.Swift, the issue was that she signed a contract as 14yo and the contract itself lasted for what 13-14 years..? So the terms she agreed to as a child (while having no idea how successful she would become) lasted for longer than a decade. 

But bts’ contract was up and they re-negotiated and re-signed a new one. Owning masters can be negotiated through a contract and it wouldn’t be too much to assume that bts might have demanded the rights to their music when re-signing (and lord knows that bh is so dependent on bts that they have close to no choice but to agree to their demands). 




Also, deadlines for music are a thing, lol. If you don’t set a time, you’ll struggle to finish a full body of work. Whenever me and my band members work on our music, we always have a deadline (that takes into account everyone’s pace), otherwise, it just can’t be organized. Just like many people, including myself, prefer to write 12 essays with a deadline every week then to write 12 essays throughout a 3 month period with no clear schedule.  I don’t think that means that we or bts don’t have a say in when their music gets released."

If you call this out, half of the fandom would say they dont care about the numbers or charts anymore etc. But even as recent as few days back Namjoon said they want a Grammy nom. So i dont understand what exactly is it that they are going for. Are the boys doing what they want how they w ant to or are they held back/sabotaged by BH!"

All you have to do is watch RMs vlives where he explains their albums and you will understand how involved they (or at least he) is since there is no way you can talk that in depth about the music if you weren't a part of the process of making it."
1514,2020-06-30 05:01:36,hia1hw,"I am not sure *just* was implied and I wish I could remember the exact source.  Pretty sure it was fairly recently. The members were asked what the most important thing in making music was to them.  And (I think it was JK) said conveying emotions, someone else said connecting with the audience and Suga being Suga said making a commercially successful song.  I thought it was funny.

edit: during the 7 promotions is when Suga said that they were influenced by current trends, not the same interview."
1515,2020-06-30 05:30:09,hia1hw,It's on MOTS7 the journey ( Japanese )interview..either the tv or magazine one.
1516,2020-06-30 05:18:59,hia1hw,Was he being sarcastic?
1517,2020-07-01 07:22:00,hia1hw,"I know that they like to be unique and different for their title tracks. But they can make a unique song which is easy to listen without completely following current trends for commercial success. IDK what direction they are going but Song like marching band anthem which is completely out of current league won’t help them in anyway. Some people will say this album help them gain new fans . But They gain new fans after every comeback which is nothing new. If it’s the kind of song they want to release, it’s fine. I feel like they’re expecting big numbers and some people to interest into these kinds of songs at the same time while even part of  their fandom don’t like the song. When black swan came out, i thought they’re going for Grammy and they released On which is a little bit confusing. (Sry my eng is kinda bad)"
1518,2020-06-30 04:47:33,hia1hw,"When I say gain respect for artistry. I am talking about the fellow artists, producers, composers, etc. in the music and entertainment community, not whether they gain more obsessive fans. 

Those good reviews are nice but they're still being seen and regarded as if they are a novelty act and not here to stay. And, again those sales only show how big the fandom is not whether people are actually taking them seriously when they leave the room so to speak."
1519,2020-06-30 03:49:55,hia1hw,"curious, what exactly do their promotions entail other than music shows, performances, whatever you wanna call them. I'm mostly curious because i know that bighit had bts stop doing variety ages ago, the most theyve done is us interviews and thats not even variety. i know their music from what ive heard is much more gp friendly but i guess i wonder what bighit is doing outside of that to widen their domestic general public interest.

i definitely think its good that txt didnt have to promote while sick and pushed it back and everything bc no one wants them not getting better and spreading it and such but overall i guess i worry for txt because bighit relies on the core fanbase with bts and gave up forever ago on widening gp interest bc they were able to rely on armys and its not great to have rookies follow in those footsteps when bts's ability to do that was pure luck"
1520,2020-06-30 03:10:06,hia1hw,"The point is TXT was a guaranteed success. All Big Hit had to do was keep itself from imploding and they would be golden. And they have, but other companies could have done even better."
1521,2020-06-30 00:55:32,hia1hw,"K, thanks for explaining that to me - I was under the impression that they were levels of the same contract type, not different things entirely."
1522,2020-06-30 04:39:09,hia1hw,"The group as a brand has recognition and they have had impact obviously but imo bh is more focused in getting them to promote/sell products/merch but not so much on their work except for maybe suga, but then again i still don't know why his album wasn't on streaming platforms in korea. They have the resources to work with people who can align to what they want to do and bring something new and exciting to the table. Ideally their music would be their legacy but for me it seems that the music has been getting secondary treatment, and I get that that's the business but I foolishly thought it would be different."
1523,2020-07-01 04:32:52,hia1hw,Thank you for explaining me. That’s side to hear. I really like motivation. I thought she was going to release something after but now thinking about it it’s been a long time that I didn’t hear about her.
1524,2020-07-02 16:10:16,hia1hw,"Wow, I always wondered why she did not blow up since I always find her the most talentedand charismatic out of her group. Now this makes so much sense."
1525,2020-07-14 18:35:48,hia1hw,"ON was practically sabotaged by CR though. Now we all know they have only a distribution deal, BUT if you do some research you can see distribution deal does involve the extra basic things like Distribution to readio and other streaming services. Then they hit a bad time by releasing it when Covid was hitting its peak so the gp's attention and the world in general had a focus on something completely different. There were A LOT of things at play, not just On not being as general public friendly song as say BWL, and then Bighit also seemed to experiment with a different schedule(whether as a test because they think they can afford to experiment or whether trying to switch tactics that they can improve later, that is unclear) which kind of had some of its downsides like the lack of mv teasers, etc. However, their u.s promotion in terms of attending shows/events was pretty good and well thought."
1526,2020-06-30 00:50:16,hia1hw,"What would you have had them do with TXT instead? I’m actually curious. I got into them because of the innovative, artistic TU content (actually their concept trailer with the projection mapping) so like the focus on investing in the content worked on me but what else should they be doing? To me it looks like they’re focusing on expanding them into the Japanese market for now, and it seems like that’s going just fine for them, but I don’t really know enough to say what is smart and what isn’t."
1527,2020-06-30 00:37:47,hia1hw,"Barely. There's like what?  Five non-solo credits for the members' production among \~50 songs on the last five albums.

They most likely give input to the producers, but they aren't the ones designing it. And still, there is far more that goes into the music for kpop comebacks than this."
1528,2020-06-30 01:12:28,hia1hw,"Solo producing pop music for yourself isn't weird at all. 

I know they have a (limited) say in how things sound. I'm literally just saying they can't be considered self-produced because they're not the ones actually doing the work."
1529,2020-06-30 07:16:28,hia1hw,Yeah esp. when he is the one to say that they could have churned out chart topping hits with the same formula but they care more about their artistic growth. (It was in BTSilence)
1530,2020-06-30 05:29:15,hia1hw,With him..it can be..😅but he did said those words in Japanese interview for their Mots 7  the journey promo.
1531,2020-06-30 04:12:57,hia1hw,"I follow TXT only somewhat but they have definitely been doing variety appearances with their latest comeback. I think there’s other promo like advertising banners in Seoul but I’m not so sure about how widespread that is. I also think that the BH philosophy is if they invest in creative, quality content and quality music (and BH has a lot of $$ to invest..), the fans will come. They release mvs for almost all of their bsides. I think the extended TU music videos and the concept trailers are their own form of promotion. People talk about them, and new fans are gained in a word-of-mouth manner. I think they’ve also been focusing on expanding in Japan. They’re releasing a second Japanese single later this summer and I think? they’ve already had TXT merch pop-up stores located in Japan."
1532,2020-06-30 03:52:31,hia1hw,"My point is that TXT was a guaranteed success no matter the concept, story, music style, or actual members themselves. I just think that BH could have done even better than they have."
1533,2020-06-30 00:43:56,hia1hw,"RM, Suga, J-Hope have been credited as recording engineers, on instrumentals, as well as rap and vocal arrangments. The vocal line has been credited with creating melodies for some of the songs as well.

Also, giving input during the productions makes them more invovled in the production than anything. As performers and artists, I wouldn't expect them to be the sound engineer/mixer for all of, or even majority of, the songs - their in-house producers are there for a reason.

Edit:
Also, isn't their next comeback going to be ""everything done by the members"" - maybe with a little help from staff for technical processes - but we shall see how the credits look for the upcoming comeback."
1534,2020-06-30 01:24:52,hia1hw,"You should take a look at how a majority of pop music across the world is made then. Rarely does a pop artist solo produce their work. 

We disagree then, but that's okay. I think they (some members more than others) have a significant say in how things sound. I agree they shouldn't be called self-produced (very very few acts should) but you made it sound like they barely had any say at all which i can't get behind."
1535,2020-06-30 07:17:31,hia1hw,"He did really?! Lol 
Must have missed that one."
1536,2020-06-30 04:14:23,hia1hw,I agree to an extent on your first point. I guess I was wondering if you had concrete ideas about different steps BH should have taken?
1537,2020-06-30 01:14:00,hia1hw,"I never understand people that think an artist have to physically take part in every aspect of music making for them to be involved as artists. It's so weird and never happens in other entertainment industries. 

Nevermind the fact that as you say, BTS are pretty hands on and physically invovled in the process."
1538,2020-06-30 01:12:40,hia1hw,"Yes, I do think it would be silly to expect them to single-handedly create every piece of music that they perform and because they don't they cannot be considered self-produced. That's it."
1539,2020-06-30 01:34:05,hia1hw,"I don't need to, I'm perfectly aware of how most pop music is created. It's irrelevant because we were specifically talking about how the label of self-producing applies to BTS. Which as I said before it does not. And, to be completely honest I would say only one member genuinely cares about the product. Good talk."
1540,2020-07-01 15:01:34,hia1hw,[He was serious. You can try find original translations but thats a screenshot](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ebx4tBxWsAAzO0A?format=jpg&name=900x900)
1541,2020-06-30 04:39:01,hia1hw,"Well, for starters they should have debuted their second boy group at least a year earlier. Ideally, however, they would have been debuting a girl group first instead so as not to overlap the fan demographics."
1542,2020-06-30 01:49:29,hia1hw,"I understand your point, but I don't think anybody was saying otherwise. They have had help from their in-house producers from the start of their career, for many of their songs and even some songs on the mixtapes, to consider it exclusively self-produced. However, they have, from the beginning, been very involved in their music projects and album creation - from songwriting, arrangements, mixing, and mastering. 😊

Edit: punctuation fix."
1543,2020-06-30 02:08:39,hia1hw,"Hey, just to add on. I understand your opinion, but I respectfully disagree. All of the members have made demos for multiple songs, and more frequently, as of recent years, now they have gotten more experience on their hands with the production process. 

Usually, RM's or Suga's demos get chosen, most likely because their production experience translates into great quality. The lack of credits on production for other members does not equate to a lack of care for the product. And, great talk btw.

Edit: grammar fix"
1544,2020-06-30 05:11:39,hia1hw,"Don't be shy, drop the member"
1545,2020-07-01 15:11:49,hia1hw,Oh I haven't seen this before. Thanks.
1546,2020-06-30 02:24:23,hia1hw,"Having rejected demos doesn't really speak to talent or skill though?

This is considering the self-produced songs that have been released so far. The quality of them or lack thereof is what speaks to a lack of care for the music in my view.

And I suppose passionate would be a more accurate term to describe the member I had in mind."
1547,2020-06-30 02:59:05,hia1hw,"Rejected demos and lack of quality, especially with not having much production experience, does not translate as a ""lack of care"" in my opinion. From what I understand of their production process, it's more of a ""round table discussion"" than just a ""hot potato pass it on"" type of environment (hopefully that makes some sense 😅) - so it's natural that they would choose the demos with more quality, which likely would be from an experienced memeber.

Regarding ""self-produced"" songs, I believe many of the vocal line members, and even Hoseok, are experimental and finding their own niche with production, and most likely are not fully comfortable or consistent in terms of crafting piece after piece.

From what I know, many of the members are working on productions recently, with their upcoming album and solo mixtapes. It's been pointed out by the more experienced members that the others have actively asked and are learning to produce better quality pieces. So I don't think it's a lack of passion, but hesitance to dive out of their comfort zone and to craft frequently - which I am sure they're doing but probably are unsatisfied with the product, as are many who are starting out and want to make commendable, high-quality piece within the first few tries.

Edit: added to last sentence."
1548,2020-06-30 03:16:36,hia1hw,"I guess we're just operating on different meanings here because I don't consider working on something to necessarily mean that one is passionate about it. 

Just because I want to do my job better it doesn't mean I'm  passionate about serving food."
1549,2020-06-30 03:31:15,hia1hw,"Maybe, but it's not right to consider them to be mutually exclusive either. What's more, they have touched on this topic of ""passion vs. work"" in creating music and have shared their opinions on it as well. 

Anyways, we don't know them personally enough to draw conclusion on whether they are actually passionate for their craft or not (this ""passion vs. work, and wavering feelings on their craft"" is what their MOTS series is about), but I personally believe they are passionate and take their artistry seriously. And I respect your opinion and feelings if you feel otherwise because at the end of the day, it's not something we can verify from wherever we are. Great talk (again) 😊

Edit: paragraphs because it's easier on the eyes."
1550,2020-06-29 21:56:24,hi9lb8,"I first heard of this band while I was stationed over in England.....thanks to my then new late 60's born Cali roommate schooling me on what the LA New Wave music scene (I knew the hardcore scene) was in the States at the time (I had been in England 2.5 years at that time) in 1983. I bought *Spring Session M* as well, this song sticks in your head like glue. By the way very good technopop album, solid. Lightweight, but if you want to have an 80's music night you could do far worse then *Spring Session M*, Missing Persons first full length album.

Lead singer Dale Bozzio and drummer Terry (who came over from Frank Zappas band) were married at the time. It wouldn't be surprising if Dale had an influence on Lady Gaga.

This is one of the best examples that I know of when it comes to 80's technopop songs, maybe you guys have some favorites you can share here.

Its a shame you can't get HQ sound with fun videos, but here's the HQ version of the song....

[Destination Unknown (HQ)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RqHBfUTIKY)

Much much cleaner sound. Worth listening to.

Some day if no one puts it up I'm going to put up *No More Words* by Berlin just for fun. But moderator Jen doesn't want us to go crazy with videos and I don't blame her. This isn't the 80's music sub-reddit afterall. But that was right in my wheelhouse when I hit New Wave clubs in the mid-80's."

Yes, the 80's had a lot of cheesy fun videos and songs to queue up the fledgling MTV playlist.......but some people forget how much great music there was beneath the surface in the 80's also."
1560,2020-06-30 02:30:13,hi9lb8,Definitely agree but the key phrase in your comment is “beneath the surface” - which is where the best music still tends to be found

So many great post-punk bands, hardcore, thrash, alternative (SST wow), and REM at their best (as I see it). Even the late 80's Seattle sound/grunge was in play. It set up the 1990's."

I've always loved pop music from all decades and had to repress a lot of that love to try to fit in as a man. I've been listening to so much femme pop lately and it makes me feel so liberated and myself. I still like some more masculine music but on the whole I think my music taste is more ""feminine"" (whatever that means) and it feels good to admit that.  My music taste is a lot more diverse now. Kim Petras Malibu video was what made me finally admit to myself that I'm trans and that's song of the year for sure!"

1573,2020-06-29 20:41:12,hi7c53,"That statement itself is even more.. tone deaf and frankly far more insidiously racist than just not liking pop music but that’s an entirely different conversation from the one we’re having.

Black people being a foundation of most, if not all, music genres, pop music is purely based on what is attractive; The aesthetics. Black ideals are attractive but not black skin.

What you’ve said is “I like gangsta rap” as a contrast to pop music, othering black people before any context is given is at the very least is.. really fuckin strange and at worst, sparks red flags that as black person I would avoid talking to you just based on that."

1588,2020-06-29 17:42:36,hi3xua,A Doja Cat collab sounds super fake

1590,2020-06-29 18:04:21,hi3xua,"obviously fake, but monochromatica is a good title for a dramatic, acoustic/orchestra version of the album."
1591,2020-06-29 17:48:14,hi3xua,yeah it’s definitely fake but like...can we have it?
1592,2020-06-29 18:07:26,hi3xua,No way she collabed with Doja already when she took years to collab with Ari 💀
1593,2020-06-29 17:15:36,hi3xua,"girl, no"
1594,2020-06-29 17:20:38,hi3xua,I remember not believing the leaks about Elton John and Blackpink being on Chromatica but that turned out to be true so who knows 😭 this whole era is a mess djdjd

1599,2020-06-29 17:47:44,hi3xua,this is what set off my alarms too
1600,2020-06-30 12:04:25,hi3xua,but to be fair so did an Ariana collab. Everyone thought that was too good to be true

Plus it's not the first time Amazon have done this, they did it with the Panic At The Disco live album and the Clarity vinyl release."
1605,2020-06-29 18:50:20,hi3xua,Nymphomaniac definitely going to slap if it's true

1607,2020-06-30 12:23:36,hi3xua,..No? An ariana collab seems so much more feasible to me
1608,2020-06-30 02:48:18,hi3xua,"I know, but if it did come out it wouldn't say (with SOPHIE) in the title like on this fakeass tracklist."
1609,2020-06-29 17:38:36,hi3xua,"E-commerce specialist here. Any listing gets its ASIN number at the time of creation. The page wouldn’t be up if there was no ASIN, so it is definitely fake."

1657,2020-06-29 18:32:09,hi2ugn,2013 one of the best years in music IMHO
1658,2020-06-29 16:28:49,hi2ugn,"My ballot for today (it's gonna be a doozy):

Alex Cameron, Altar of Plagues, Autechre, Bill Callahan, Billy Woods, Boards of Canada, Burial, Chelsea Wolfe, Daniel Avery, Darkside, Deafheaven, Dean Blunt, DJ Sprinkles, Fire! Orchestra, Forest Swords, Fuck Buttons, Galcher Lustwerk, Gorguts, The Haxan Cloak, Holden, Huerco S, Ichiko Aoba, Iron & Wine, James Blake, Jason Isbell, Jessy Lanza, Jon Hopkins, Julia Holter, Kanye West, The Knife, Laura Marling, Laurel Halo, Machinedrum, Manchester Orchestra, Mark Kozelek & Jimmy SaValle, Matana Roberts, Melanie de Biasio, Melt-Banana, Moderat, MBV, Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds, OPN, Sigur Ros, Tim Hecker, Touché Amoré, Tricot, and Vampire Weekend.

Firstly, the 2013 ballot is the first year where it's truly stacked with incredible albums top to bottom, and I encourage everyone to fill their ballots up as much as they want. Perhaps I'm also biased because this was the year I actually started getting into music, but hey, we all start sometime.

Secondly, the results of the 2011 ballot are, well, unexpected to say the least. Some albums ended much higher and much lower than I would've anticipated them, and some albums I thought were a lock either barely made the cut or missed it entirely. Safe to say, this tournament is shaping up to be very interesting."

(their last good album tbh), Tegan and Sara, and Vampire Weekend. 

Overall, a fucking fantastic year, especially for indie pop and alt rock."

1716,2020-06-29 20:15:07,hhxqzt,It really is. These kind of meme mashups that go on for around 10 minutes tend to fizzle out in their second half. This one however... just keeps on giving. It's so silly but so damn perfectly composed.
1717,2020-06-30 03:44:33,hhxqzt,a mans gotta make his coin somehow ¯\\\_(° ͜ʖ)\_/¯
1718,2020-06-30 03:33:31,hhxqzt,"hey thanks a ton everyone!! made this a couple of months ago for a post-lockdown party but just found this subreddit and thought yall might appreciate it here.

gave me the friendly push I needed to start work on the sequel <3"
1719,2020-06-29 10:40:20,hhxb18,WITH 1 SONG
1720,2020-06-29 11:20:13,hhxb18,How... prestigious is this list though? I mean does it have any real backing or just kworb putting their own list?
1721,2020-06-29 13:17:28,hhxb18,"this is cool but how is The Weeknd still #3? Bro just dropped a project, took over, and sat on his Blinding Lights laurels😂 king"
1722,2020-06-29 10:29:37,hhxb18,"Whoah.

What’s the source here???"
1723,2020-06-29 13:20:40,hhxb18,They gotta drop the album now 😭
1724,2020-06-29 15:38:55,hhxb18,Wow
1725,2020-06-30 00:05:14,hhxb18,Wow and you got a big 5 rivalry between YG entertainment to which Blackpink belongs to and Big hit entertainment BTS.
1726,2020-06-29 12:38:39,hhxb18,THE POWER THEY HOLD
1727,2020-06-29 12:53:27,hhxb18,"Well it's just a chart maintained by kworb.net that often gets referred to but it's interesting to take a look at to see how well an artist does when the various digital platforms are combined (iTunes, Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube).

I guess it's meaningful for Blackpink b/c it's the first girl group to go #1 on the chart."
1728,2020-06-29 11:45:11,hhxb18,[removed]
1729,2020-06-29 14:50:32,hhxb18,Blinding Lights SOTY
1730,2020-06-29 10:35:01,hhxb18,https://kworb.net/itunes/
1731,2020-06-29 13:22:37,hhxb18,there's still the next single in july~august
1732,2020-06-29 13:52:34,hhxb18,">I guess it's meaningful for Blackpink b/c it's the first girl group to go #1 on the chart.

I mean I guess it's a fair accomplishment if all are measured by the same criteria. You can never top enough charts lol. Also I like Kworb, they have cool stats."
1733,2020-06-29 15:27:27,hhxb18,"What I meant by that is what data is it exactly? Who calculated the points? How were the calculated? Can we verify it? Kworb just tells us some points which it somehow calculated from its algorithm, there's no major publisher backing its data. It's like if we created a website, made up our own system of metric, and then published a list. I mean sure we can do that, but does it really mean anything?

But as I said, it's still a fun measurement for popularity as it's going to use the same method for everyone. How significant it is? As significant as all of us decide it to be."
1734,2020-06-29 16:59:19,hhxb18,Whole album is damn fire.
1735,2020-06-30 02:11:39,hhxb18,"Fr fr album of the year

still am not over that After Hours beat drop"
1736,2020-06-29 13:23:10,hhxb18,You're not listening. I need the album now. ☹️
1737,2020-06-29 17:04:39,hhxb18,"Seems like kworb is a one man band, but if you click on his [FAQ](https://kworb.net/faq.html) he goes into some detail about how he calculates the points (for specific charts) -- If you click on BLACKPINK on the charts there's a ton of information about where the group is on a wide range of charts. But there's no formula on how his percentages translate into points. Or at least I didn't see one.

It's an interesting read."

1755,2020-08-19 21:37:04,icwz2l,"Cancelled? You meant Arrested, right?"
1756,2020-08-19 21:39:33,icwz2l,That dude is the most stereotypical predator caricature I’ve ever seen
1757,2020-08-19 21:39:33,icwz2l,Why is he not rotting in a prison cell as we speak?
1758,2020-08-19 21:37:45,icwz2l,Yes I did. Can I change it?
1759,2020-08-19 21:39:13,icwz2l,Well both really. He shouldn’t have a career with young models after he gets out of jail.
1760,2020-08-19 21:42:36,icwz2l,He is vile. And apparently he has a massive dong he parades about.
1761,2020-08-19 22:44:38,icwoqy,"She’s the epitome of a glass cannon, you always have to go first and sweep because of how her skills work."
1762,2020-08-19 21:19:56,icwoqy,Got this from a Superior Summon which was a nice surprise. The gacha is solid but I haven’t seen her in use at all yet.
1763,2020-08-19 21:56:21,icwoqy,Bruh you are lucky lol. I guess use her hell park 100 or harvest eom.
1764,2020-08-20 05:34:50,icwoqy,Sell her! Cause she doesn't wanna be friends
1765,2020-08-19 23:01:54,icwoqy,Maybe I’m misunderstanding something but won’t that just make her mute the opposing team and then reduce her HP by half? Wouldn’t going 2nd with reduced health deal more for her turn?
1766,2020-08-20 02:01:56,icwoqy,I feel like she'd go well with Nebiros due to the resurrection mechanic leaving her with less than 50% life. I don't have either so I can't verify.
1767,2020-08-19 23:20:48,icwoqy,"Perhaps, but there’s also the possibility she’ll die first before that dark premonition skill comes into play because she can be squishy. If you were build her with life brands, you might find her damage lacking. Frankly the play I'd go for is Lakshmi and her first turn ailment infliction with OG Alice for assassination and a speedster. And tbh, if you’re planning on using her for PvE, don’t because there are better."
1768,2020-08-20 05:42:55,icwoqy,Ah Call of the Dead summons at the end of the enemy turn so that could be an interesting mechanic.
1769,2020-08-19 20:24:36,icv4sd,Probably not. She didn’t really have Beyoncé at the Monster Ball.
1770,2020-08-19 20:53:23,icv4sd,"Oh alright I see, thanks!"
1771,2020-08-19 22:22:01,icuu80,"Glad to see you guys incorporated some jam bands into your podcasts - I was confused why you were posting here when I read Taylor swift but read over your post again and saw umph comes up in episode 5 :) listened for a few minutes and definitely not awkward and you guys sound pretty good!

Good luck :)"
1772,2020-08-19 22:46:04,icuu80,"Sounds interesting, I’ll check it out. If you like jambands + pop, check out Jimkata (in general) but specifically their brand new song “Waiting for You”. I can’t stop listening to it, nice blend of my favorite genres."
1773,2020-08-20 01:50:15,icuu80,Deep dive into ween would be amazing
1774,2020-08-19 22:23:24,icuu80,We love pop music and jam so much so we thought we’d get some creative energy out. Thanks for the love!
1775,2020-08-20 10:58:12,icuu80,Thanks so much for the rec!
1776,2020-08-20 10:58:25,icuu80,Soooo true
1777,2020-08-19 20:11:06,icuq8a,"Listening to the Gaga podcast. I'm liking it, the only minor critique I have so far (and this may have changed already in newer episodes) is that sometimes you two go on meandering tangents (but hey, it's a jam, right?). So from that, for the listener, I think if it sounded more like you had ore of an outline or script then it would flow better.

That said, though, I really liked it and would definitely listen at work to future episodes. 

I think you made some very great points when you discussed how the jam scene can be very closed off and unreceptive of anything that isn't jam or jam adjacent. I can definitely appreciate pop music from all generations, from ABBA to boybands to Lady Gaga."
1778,2020-08-19 20:15:18,icuq8a,Thanks so much for the feedback! We’re definitely getting our feet under ourselves with the audio quality and getting comfortable as cohosts. I appreciate you taking the time to listen!!
1779,2020-08-19 20:18:00,icuq8a,"The audio quality was fine, actually, it sounded like two good friends having a conversation. And because of that, it was definitely easy to listen to."
1780,2020-08-19 20:31:06,icuq8a,That's good to hear! I do our editing too and I think it's decent but after so much listening it's so nice to have an outside opinion.

1807,2020-08-19 01:10:12,ic8jjs,Gaga will never do rain on me like that. it is personal for Gaga and Telephone was meant for Britney Spears and Gaga had no true connection with that song.
1808,2020-08-20 21:44:50,ic8jjs,Even if she only performs ROM why is that bad?
1809,2020-08-18 23:02:26,ic8jjs,They never performed Telephone live together.
1810,2020-08-19 01:38:06,ic8jjs,There was still a connection. Gaga said she wanted Telephone on the fame but couldn’t get it until the fame monster.
1811,2020-08-18 23:11:18,ic8jjs,"Ooooh gotchya. But I mean surely she’s gonna do another song with ROM, right? Like ROM will be the intro, then it’ll lead into 911 or something. What do ya think? She’s gotta use this time to promote something new, right?"
1812,2020-08-18 23:43:02,ic8jjs,Put your paw prayers up

1836,2020-09-06 23:01:35,int56c,"I'll put it this way. In private, he didn't mind working with her or being her friend.. Publicly, he didn't want his music associated with her. 

Which that made sense for him at that time. 

It was just excuses being made. She was the bigger artist then and she thought she had two songs that were coming out with Kendrick. 

But each time it was a last minute reason on Kendrick's side as to why it couldn't release; so she gave up on it."

1839,2020-09-06 21:02:49,insjx5,Everyone who lost money this year is going on tour. I’d expect more concerts than ever next year.

1841,2020-09-06 20:19:52,insjx5,BTS had 15 stadium shows sold out in North America for 2020 that have been postponed but not yet cancelled.
1842,2020-09-06 20:55:29,insjx5,"As someone with tickets to Lover Fest, idk why people keep acting like it's already been cancelled? It's indefinitely postponed to next year, and I guess we'll see if it gets pushed back again, cancelled, or scheduled for real in summer 2021. (Tbh I think cancellation is more likely than a show next summer, but I would rather have it be pushed all the way back to 2022 than give up my tickets 😭)

I'm really hoping to see Dua, Rina, Allie X, Haim, and Chloe x Halle on tour once concerts can safely start up again. I also bought tickets to see Kesha and JoJo this year, back when that was a reasonable thing to be doing -- those concerts were fully cancelled, but I hope the opportunity to see them tour their new albums comes up again!"
1843,2020-09-06 22:11:32,insjx5,"I'm going to take a leap of faith and say that we won't see touring return until at least June 2021. The vaccines are close to being done, but the WHO released a statement recently that global vaccination won't be reality until halfway through next year. Even June 2021 for concerts feels conservative, because I have to assume there will be some lag time after the pandemic is ""over"" before concerts go fully back to normal."
1844,2020-09-06 21:43:13,insjx5,Why doesn't Nicki tour alone tho? Is she not able to fill arenas on her own or what? Im legit curious
1845,2020-09-06 20:32:41,insjx5,"post - he is one of the reading and leeds headliners + his new album is prolly coming out this year

i hope more chromatica ball dates will be added and ill see gaga in europe 🥺"
1846,2020-09-06 21:08:31,insjx5,Katy Perry - The Smile Tour
1847,2020-09-06 22:20:23,insjx5,"I’ll be very surprised if tours on the scale of popheads’ faves will be able to happen in the first half of 2021. I had tickets to see Harry, Dua and Gaga but I will be shocked if any of those go ahead when they’re supposed to, in the UK at least. Shows at MSG in January/February 2021 are already being rescheduled for 2022."
1848,2020-09-06 23:51:36,insjx5,"I think it’s a bit over optimistic to expect any sort of large tour before September 2021 - remember vaccines still take months roll out and we’re a long way away from overcoming this virus in Europe and Asia, let alone the shit show that is America right now (you guys are aware you are no where near done with this, right? Just because we’ve opened up in Europe and East Asia doesn’t mean it’s all over now)"
1849,2020-09-06 20:49:19,insjx5,"All I know is that considering the show was supposed to be in April and I've since moved to a whole-ass new region, I wish Billie's people would at least come up with *something* besides ""postponed"" so that I could get a refund. I really need the money right now 😭"
1850,2020-09-07 02:51:59,insjx5,"I was supposed to see Allie X on her Cape God tour in Atlanta so fingers crossed that I’ll get to see her tour that album still next year. I saw her open for Marina in Seattle last year and she was fucking electric. I love Marina to pieces and she’s outstanding live (it was my 4th time seeing her) but Allie was even better. Her voice just filled up the entire auditorium, some of the best live vocals I’ve had the pleasure of listening to in person. She fucking killed it. The live rendition of “Fresh Laundry” was everything."
1851,2020-09-07 10:51:20,insjx5,"She hasn’t released an album yet, but Lily Allen has said she has recorded quite a few songs, and the reason she hasn’t released them is because she needs to tour to make money, since streaming isn’t doing her much good. Fingers crossed for an album sometime next year and maybe a tour at the end of the year or start of 2022"
1852,2020-09-07 16:54:17,insjx5,"Cardi has been clear that she gets paid more for one-off 45 minute shows rather than a true tour. I’ll be curious to see what she does next, I could see her co-headlining with Megan. Her stage sets are amazing!"
1853,2020-09-06 21:44:40,insjx5,"Not really a tour but I expected to see Charli here in Mexico this year and it didnt happen :(
I hope they postponed it and not cancel."
1854,2020-09-06 22:25:33,insjx5," Avril Lavigne will continue her tour from January-March 2021! 

Was supposed to happen from February-May 2020 but got rescheduled."
1855,2020-09-07 03:18:53,insjx5,"Well, the Rona tour for one"
1856,2020-09-07 16:53:00,insjx5,"That was supposed to happen last summer, it won’t happen now"
1857,2020-09-06 21:04:28,insjx5,"> I’d expect more concerts than ever next year.

as someone who works for a football stadium, my bank account is ready to be filled."
1858,2020-09-06 22:13:25,insjx5,"Gaga and Rina are too powerful for me to handle in one night, lmao."
1859,2020-09-06 20:59:39,insjx5,Was Rina ment to open for gaga?!?!?
1860,2020-09-07 10:52:32,insjx5,Rina is too good for opening. She needs a full tour to herself to promote the hell out of the masterpiece that is SAWAYAMA
1861,2020-09-07 09:51:15,insjx5,Rina? She’s going on a tour of her own (with Hana opening) this year and next.
1862,2020-09-07 16:10:25,insjx5,Take me with you
1863,2020-09-06 22:44:25,insjx5,i feel like huge stadium tours and shows will probably be the last ones to resume due to how high capacity they are. beyoncé apparently had a stadium tour booked to begin this year too that was pushed back. i could see bts doing one off shows in south korea and maybe japan depending on the situations there at various points in time but i don't think the MOTS tour will be able to begin for at least another year
1864,2020-09-07 09:10:48,insjx5,I feel like Lover Fest will be reimagined now she has a whole other album out.
1865,2020-09-06 21:45:20,insjx5,"Beats me. The Pinkprint tour had sooo many guest appearances, so maybe it's just her thing?"
1866,2020-09-07 16:52:17,insjx5,"She is not able to fill arenas on her own. 

Her co-headlining tour with Future was cancelled due to lack of sales (“scheduling issues” after the dates had been announced, venues had been booked, tickets had been sold) and a few of her UK dates with Juice Wrld were cancelled from a rumored lack of sales."
1867,2020-09-06 21:21:22,insjx5,That's all I need 😭😭😭
1868,2020-09-06 22:14:39,insjx5,"If she goes on tour, which is unlikely, it would probably be in late ‘21/2022. She just had a child, so that’s probably he number one focus. Though, I would kill to see her do a show similar to Britney’s Circus Tour."
1869,2020-09-06 21:44:05,insjx5,Welcome to the circus
1870,2020-09-07 16:47:54,insjx5,I think it’s basically confirmed Katy is doing a residency at the Coliseum in Las Vegas?

1872,2020-09-07 03:09:39,insjx5,SAME i haven’t been back since March...i was supposed to work the Hella Mega Tour😭
1873,2020-09-06 22:33:52,insjx5,I’ve seen a lot of talk about it especially after Rina covered DITD.  I’m sure it’s all hypothetical but it’s fun to think about.
1874,2020-09-07 02:07:09,insjx5,Right. I highly doubt she'll tour this album. The era is basically over she probably rebrand and drop something folksy in 2021 October
1875,2020-09-06 23:57:30,insjx5,"Okay but what if it was a literal circus and she wore a clown costume and performed with elephants, bears ballancing on balls and acrobats as her background dancers"

Good to know bcs I think having more exposure would do favors for his career and I'm sure a lot of people would love him once he's discovered, he's absolutely wholesome so he would definitely garner a lot of fans after him performing on there. I even saw a post on here by someone saying they dreamt of a Joji song featured on a disney movie (Finding Nemo, if I'm not mistaken) I think the path that Joji is trying to achieve is something like that, classic, wholesome, even family friendly I think, imagine Bruno Mars-level type of stardom."

1900,2020-09-06 02:10:14,ind366,Ngl back in the day lady gags got some boos. 8 yo me was jamming to her.
1901,2020-09-05 23:25:54,inavv3,"Thanks for writing this up, and sharing!"
1902,2020-09-06 16:44:41,inavv3,Awesome review!
1903,2020-09-10 17:20:10,inavv3,"Thanks for this! Mine will be built next week so should get it shortly after, excited to say the least!"
1904,2020-09-13 20:07:43,inavv3,"Thanks for your review! Sounds like you have the driving assistant package? If right, how do you find it? Any issues?"
1905,2020-11-04 20:49:00,inavv3,"Thanks for that review, really helpful as I’ve had the car a couple days now and absolutely love it! First hybrid and a few things that I cannot work out or can’t find in the Mercedes literature, 

\- does any of the driving modes allow For the maximum self charging when driving?

\- which mode do you get the best mpg out of (non pure ev) did a motorway journey today and did a total of 175 miles and averaged out at 60mpg, seems a little low but the car has only done a total of 200 miles, so I assume it’s settling in?

\-my electric range is only 32, is this right for the car being new?"
1906,2020-11-05 19:19:14,inavv3,Quick question OP if you don't mind . I've just taken delivery of my very own 250e but have a question about the 3 pin charger. Do you know if it is water proof? I can't find anything in the manual and don't have a proper charging point installed yet. Tia
1907,2020-09-06 10:44:54,inavv3,"Good, please don't view the charging points as prime location parking spots. The cars should be removed when they are done charging."
1908,2020-09-06 17:16:01,inavv3,Thanks!
1909,2020-09-10 21:27:14,inavv3,"Where are you from and when did you order it?

&#x200B;

I ordered mine 3-4 weeks ago and still waiting on a delivery date, I am hoping before christmas but hearing of long delays on some mercedes cars in the UK."
1910,2020-09-13 20:57:02,inavv3,"It’s great, but sometimes, if I’m going into a side lane to turn at speed, it thinks the barrier is going to collide and it breaks the left hand wheels to stop what it thinks might be a collision and alerts me. So the sensor algorithm needs updating - adjusting. If you indicate it will ignore it as the car know you are moving that way deliberately. However, it doesn’t actually swerve the car, it’s not dangerous."
1911,2020-11-05 11:45:32,inavv3,"To your questions, 

Yes, if you set electric only mode you can use the flappy paddle to increase or decrease recharge.

Best MPG is using eco mode. You need to coast allot, it technically has 5 brakes if you include it recharging as it switches polarity. 

I’ve had 42 out of it, it shows the range compared to how you drive. 

Tip, you might need to change some of the assist driving functions to tune the car to your driving style. 

Enjoy! I am 3000 miles and two months in.

MPG update, I hover around 92 these days."
1912,2020-11-05 23:58:04,inavv3,"Yes it is. However, I still wouldnt feel comfortable leaving it in heavy rain."
1913,2020-09-06 11:00:13,inavv3,"Especially a PHEV. I see hybrids parked at the only 22kW chargers at the mall, while they can only charge at 3.7kW max. There are 8 3.7kW sockets available, but they have to hog the faster chargers that they can't even utilize."
1914,2020-09-11 09:28:42,inavv3,"I’m from the south of England! I ordered it 5 days before we locked down so I have waited since the end of March. 

Chase them for a delivery date, as soon as they submit the order it gives them one so if they aren’t giving you one it’s likely they haven’t submitted it yet!"
1915,2020-09-14 13:44:27,inavv3,"That's good to hear thanks. Have you done any longer journeys? Once every couple of months I do a 300 mile mainly motorway journey. Would be curious how the engine performs when the battery has no juice left and also mpg?

Wouldn't be a game changer of course! Most of my day to day would likely be electric only, maybe with occasional sport for fun..."
1916,2020-11-06 19:05:05,inavv3,"Thank you! I know what you mean though, doesn't feel right leaving it in heavy rain!"
1917,2020-09-06 11:13:41,inavv3,"Yeah, because they are not reliant on public charging, PHEV drivers tend to not be aware of etiquette or others, since they never come into the situation of being Iced/hybridised/eved. If the charger is blocked, they just continue with the ice motor. 
Saw an Outlander interrupting the charge of a Model 3 at a supermarket so he could charge with Chademo. Needless to say, the Model 3 driver was not happy when he came back from his groceries to find that he hadn't charged anything since the outlander driver decided his needs where above everyone else's. In Italy, I found so many PHEV BMW just pretending to charge because the spots where close to main sights. In Germany as well. It's probably also because at least in Germany, it's beneficial for company cars to buy PHEVs for tax reasons instead of ICE cars. So the driver's who don't care about EV or not and are just happy about their BMWs don't really ever use the batteries other than to secure parking spots.
Not saying that OP does the same, just trying to spread awareness on how to use charging spots"
1918,2020-09-11 21:51:31,inavv3,"Its actually a lease so may be slightly different, i am ringing them every week."
1919,2020-09-11 11:51:33,inavv3,"I ordered mine end of May and got it delivered last week. But I was one of the first orders. However, it will be worth the wait."
1920,2020-09-14 14:39:35,inavv3,"If you actually planned your route or drive at higher speeds it will stretch the battery for the journey to give you the best mpg possible (depending on driving style). So it will switch between, obviously if you are just town driving it will stay in electric 90% of the time if you are in comfort mode. 

If you are driving just using the engine, it pulls like any decent 2 litre and feels quick in its own right. The turbo manages the power really well, cruising you can’t hear the engine. I get at motorway cruising speeds between 55-65 mpg on engine alone."
1921,2020-09-06 15:11:48,inavv3,Nice for you to tarnish all PHEV drivers with the same brush.
1922,2020-09-11 12:29:01,inavv3,"I have ordered premium plus and driver assistance pack, but the hatchback model! Maybe they built the saloons first!"
1923,2020-09-14 14:58:17,inavv3,"That sounds really impressive! What speed do you cruise at?

I'm torn between this car, same spec but hatchback or the tesla model 3... Tesla looks good but some quality control issues etc are a bit off putting"
1924,2020-09-06 15:18:14,inavv3,"Not really, I said ""tend to"". That's just my daily observation of PHEV drivers parking for hours sometimes days with just the cable connected to the charging station. Or PHEV drivers ending the charging process of others for no reason. 

Since you are new, I just wanted to share a bit of charging etiquette, most EV/PHEV drivers follow on public charging stations."
1925,2020-09-11 23:36:36,inavv3,"Saloons came second, enjoy!"
1926,2020-09-15 10:20:34,inavv3,"I had the same decision, but the Tesla was an extra 5k, you also then have factor in luxury car tax. I test drove the Tesla, great car. But needed more range for me."
1927,2020-09-06 17:15:28,inavv3,"Charging etiquette? Why would you assume I don’t have any respect for other electric vehicle users? Do they? Are you from UK/US? Tend, will mean most but not all which can be a variable of 50% to 99.9% of users."
1928,2020-09-16 07:35:53,inavv3,"As it'll be a lease through work price is quite similar, so that's not too much of an issue. Have you had much issue with 'phantom braking' with the Mercedes driving assist (adaptive cruise control, Lane keep)?"
1929,2020-09-06 17:41:19,inavv3,I didn't assume you are doing it as you can clearly read in the second post. What's wrong with sharing this? Some new users might not be aware of how this works as evidenced by the cases I came across and I'm sure other EV users also experienced.
1930,2020-09-16 07:50:36,inavv3,"I’ve had to learn how to drive the car, like I said it took me 3-4 days of driving to get used to it. Yeah, it auto brakes when you are behind a car going slower, if your foot isn’t touching the peddles. It was slightly alien at first, but I enjoy it now, feathering with the throttle and not having to press the break all the time. It makes it more of a relaxing drive."
1931,2020-09-16 08:03:40,inavv3,Yeah definitely sounds like something to get used to! Would feel pretty weird at first I'm sure. Any issues with it seemingly randomly braking during cruise control? No obvious reason but maybe misread something?
1932,2020-09-16 18:41:41,inavv3,"Nope, not for me. I’ve heard some people say if you select cruise control speed assistance it will monitor the speed sign and automatically cruise to that speed. Although sometimes rain drops can make 60 look like 80 and it’s been known that it will pick up speed signs on the back of lorries. I wouldn’t say it’s dangerous as these are only assists and can be overridden."

1935,2020-09-05 17:10:37,in4n0g,You wouldn't have been able to buy it and walk out with it anyway if you're from another state soooo....
1936,2020-09-05 18:38:18,in4n0g,"Decent job with the plot line, but I’d suggest moving a touch away from cultural stereotypes in your creative writing. Also make sure your characters are consistent, the protagonist seems well informed (according to their internal monologue) but apparently isn’t aware you can’t take possession of a handgun from either a dealer or private party outside of your state of residence. Solid B+, looking forward to your next short story!"
1937,2020-09-05 19:11:37,in4n0g,You went to another state to buy a handgun. The real reason you were refused may be that the sale would have been illegal.
1938,2020-09-05 17:51:24,in4n0g,This all sounds incredibly contrived. How were you going to buy a gun from a different state anyway?
1939,2020-09-05 17:33:51,in4n0g,"Sorry to hear about your experience, my best advice is to do your shopping in your home state (you can’t buy handguns out of state anyway) or online (and have it shipped somewhere local)."
1940,2020-09-05 21:19:37,in4n0g,"experience in criminal justice and firearms you say?

and you did not know you cannot buy a handgun in another state.

sorry, smells fishy."
1941,2020-09-05 17:09:48,in4n0g,Don’t be an idiot. Buy your gun online. Pick up at FFL. Don’t talk to them about anything other than the form you’re filling out.
1942,2020-09-05 17:08:10,in4n0g,"Wow, fucking hell. I wish I had more to say about it, but that's just fucking crazy. 

Back when I was on that side of the counter (during Obama's first term) I saw some customers who would fit the description of those dudes, but (despite being a fairly typical southern US range, gadsen flags and all) protocol was to not let them anywhere near a gun and make something up if they wanted to buy one, cause they're clearly not in their right minds.

Guess they started their own stores. 

Good choice on the VP9, that's a sweet freakin' gun!"
1943,2020-09-05 18:37:38,in4n0g,Post the name and location of the store.
1944,2020-09-05 17:34:42,in4n0g,"Yeah, so much of this story just doesn’t line up.

Feels a lot like it should be on r/thathappened"
1945,2020-09-05 19:14:49,in4n0g,He also really nailed that “sanctimonious condescending liberal” stereotype for the protagonist.
1946,2020-09-05 20:39:33,in4n0g,So glad someone said it. I was keeping my mouth shut.
1947,2020-09-05 18:47:38,in4n0g,Just have it shipped to an FFL in your home state
1948,2020-09-05 18:05:15,in4n0g,It used to be worse for black gun owners trying to purchase a firearm in the 80 and 90! That’s the reason this sub exist
1949,2020-09-05 19:17:04,in4n0g,He can’t because it’s fictional.
1950,2020-09-05 20:11:57,in4n0g,Yup. I think this was actually intended for r/neckbeardgunowners tho.
1951,2020-09-05 23:02:47,in4n0g,I have the unfortunate medical condition of not being able to keep my mouth shut.
1952,2020-09-05 19:16:10,in4n0g,Why not just buy it online then?
1953,2020-09-05 20:38:55,in4n0g,"No, r/thathappened ! Sincerely!"
1954,2020-09-05 20:43:47,in4n0g,"I have still never bought a gun online. I do like to hold them before I buy them. That being said, I have gone into large gun shops in away-states just to check out the weird stuff they have.

Maybe I find something I can't live without and have it sent home 🤷🏾‍♂️

They say don't buy art you like, buy art you can't live without."
1955,2020-09-05 22:02:03,in4n0g,"Fair point... but in OP’s story he already held and shot the VP9 at a gun range. And the VP9 isn’t exactly an obscure find, current pandemic inventory issues notwithstanding."
1956,2020-09-06 06:51:45,in4n0g,"It does all seem rather contrived. 

Although I don't really like to give any reasons to gun store employees other than ""plinking"", they can be caliber snobs worse than anything.

God forbid you mention you live in bear country, you will hear every single persons opinion about it."
1957,2020-09-05 16:35:22,in2pcx,"Woah I just went back to listen to it, I never noticed it either 😲 thanks for pointing it out"
1958,2020-09-05 16:58:14,in2pcx,I also just found out that the Bad Romance video starts with  Bach's Fugue No. 24
1959,2020-09-05 17:02:43,in2pcx,"Well, she knows her classical music apparently. Great mind blowing choices!"

1963,2020-10-10 10:32:01,j8h4fm,"Welcome!! =D I think you should see every Gaga music video! You'll fall for for her weirdness, her art. This is the first thing I did when I was in your situation about a year ago. I know exactly how you are feeling right now haha! I would love to see your fan art."
1964,2020-10-10 21:20:57,j8h4fm,"Watch all her music videos! My favorites I recommend are Paparazzi, Bad Romance, Alejandro, Telephone (the longer version), Born This Way, Judas, Marry The Night (the longer version), Applause, G.U.Y. (an ARTPOP film), Perfect Illusion, and her most recent 911. 

Check out some of her live performances too. They’re super iconic and tasteful. I love lots of them, especially where she’s playing the piano. 

If you haven’t seen A Star Is Born with Gaga and Bradley Cooper, watch it! She’s also a great actress and I really love the film. The history behind all of the ASIB movies is super cool too, and for her to be a part of that is special."
1965,2020-10-11 02:35:20,j8h4fm,"Welcome, she's the best and we're a pretty great community! I LOVE fan art, can't wait to see!  


Yoü and I is one of my most favorite songs and videos. Could watch it on repeat forever."

1981,2020-10-09 23:45:04,j88p7b,"damn was expecting and kinda hoping for bryson to do more. oh well the album *was* only 10 tracks so it has a disadvantage on that front. and listening to interviews it seems like the charts arent his priority anyways

been playing it into the ground though. im in love with the thing"

More relevant to the sub, really expected higher numbers from Bryson."
1989,2020-10-10 05:37:35,j88p7b,"Man Pop Smoke still doing over 60k shows that he would have been a superstar regardless. Some people including myself didn't really see the potential before the album. It's one thing for a deceased artist to get the boost on first week sales for a posthumous release, but over three months in? The music is really resonating given that the hype has subsided."
1990,2020-10-10 01:35:51,j88p7b,SM ll been on REPEAT
1991,2020-10-09 23:34:50,j88p7b,"So Much Fun was thugs most successfully commercial project and it's not his best same happened to 21 now, love to see him win I guess"
1992,2020-10-10 01:45:55,j88p7b, it still amazes me the amount of pure sales kpop groups has
1993,2020-10-10 01:50:04,j88p7b,I knew it would happen at some point but sucks to see Mac fall out of the top 10 for best first weeks in rap this year
1994,2020-10-10 02:23:25,j88p7b,Unreal how popular Blackpink and BTS are.
1995,2020-10-10 02:29:43,j88p7b,Where's Yung Gravy?
1996,2020-10-09 23:33:11,j88p7b,I don't know if I'm the only one but I played 21's tape only once while I was working out and don't feel like listening to it anymore. Just doesn't do it for me. I'll go back to listening to Without Warning for the 5000th time.
1997,2020-10-10 01:20:26,j88p7b,Can’t lie I thought 21 was gonna do 200k at least. Still a great achievement tho
1998,2020-10-10 05:52:47,j88p7b,best thread on this page mate thanks for all that you do 👏🏼
1999,2020-10-10 02:54:13,j88p7b,"21 never losin’, nothing grammy worthy but, his last album was very eclectic. This tape is definitely his “fun” project."

2003,2020-10-10 02:51:01,j88p7b,black pink in your area
2004,2020-10-10 01:54:35,j88p7b,is BLACKPINK kpop or am i totally wrong?
2005,2020-10-09 23:25:57,j88p7b,kinda crazy to me logic did better numbers than 21
2006,2020-10-10 01:05:29,j88p7b,Is BLACKPINK US sales only? How much did they make worldwide?
2007,2020-10-09 23:41:43,j88p7b,Who the fuck is black pink?
2008,2020-10-10 02:50:17,j88p7b,"Damn 21 doing some impressive ass numbers. Ain’t like he had a hot single or anything, it came outta nowhere. 69 gotta be hurt. Snitches and Rats is loved & this album murdered his on sales."
2009,2020-10-10 04:25:21,j88p7b,30k pure??
2010,2020-10-10 18:23:57,j88p7b,I'm surprised Dom Kennedy isn't even in the list
2011,2020-10-12 00:21:34,j88p7b,this nigga 21 really put out another timeless classic
2012,2020-10-10 03:09:56,j88p7b,21 getting better every time he drops!!!
2013,2020-10-10 06:40:36,j88p7b,So Blackpink got 103k pure? That’s a really big number but I’m more surprised that they didn’t beat 21 with that pure sales. Like I thought Kpop group always broke records in Youtube. I thought they’ll do great numbers in streaming sites too with that kinda fanbase.

2031,2020-10-10 09:07:30,j88p7b,"Halsey has bad luck. 9th biggest debut of the year, and the album dropped the same week as the surprise release 6th biggest of the year (Eminem)."

2041,2020-10-10 06:13:15,j88p7b,Im so happy that metro seems to be evolving as an artists and really putting his spin on whats popular. He knows that soudcloud bedroom producer sound is fucking fire right now and its so cool to see his take on it with insane bars from 21. One of my favorite projects all year.

2048,2020-10-10 00:11:30,j88p7b,Yeah Bryson said he doesn't care whether his album flops or does numbers because he's onto the next album by then. He's just making music for fun at this point
2049,2020-10-10 00:54:42,j88p7b,Timeless Interlude is so nostalgic
2050,2020-10-10 00:24:13,j88p7b,"Such a good album, man. Trapsoul lite is still fucking fire lol"
2051,2020-10-10 02:51:12,j88p7b,also it seems like people disappointed by his second album caused less hype for this one
2052,2020-10-10 03:53:54,j88p7b,tbh i'd rather have 10 good tracks>20+ that only have a few that are good. thats goes for any rapper. most of my favorite albums/tapes have about 10-12 songs and i can just let it play through.
2053,2020-10-10 00:41:37,j88p7b,"I've been playing on repeat since the release, so good"
2054,2020-10-10 07:56:10,j88p7b,"His album is doing really good numbers on Spotify, wouldn’t take this as gospel but you’re right, he just doing it for fun and that’s exactly what we need!"
2055,2020-10-10 06:28:48,j88p7b,Blackpink is also signed by YG.
2056,2020-10-10 00:15:50,j88p7b,very unsurprising but frankly doing these numbers 3 years after his last album (which made very little noise) and 3 years after his last big hit (wild thoughts) i think it’s pretty good. he could have done more if he added more tracks and features but for what the album is and the time it was released i think the numbers are good
2057,2020-10-10 00:04:19,j88p7b,"I'm not surprised unfortunately. I've been a huge Bryson fan for years, Trapsoul *heavily* influenced my sound as an r&b artist. But he followed that up with a weak album and then dipped for way too long."
2058,2020-10-10 00:38:43,j88p7b,Half the amount of songs that were on his last album so I think he did well
2059,2020-10-10 10:04:42,j88p7b,"with a drake ft aswell.. imagine the numbers on this without that, probably the 30k-40k range."
2060,2020-10-10 00:36:10,j88p7b,"Wish he didn’t drop the same day as SM2, I would’ve listened first week if it dropped this week instead"
2061,2020-10-10 05:36:33,j88p7b,Damn Bryson kinda flopped. Out of all of his projects I personally didn’t feel this one much. He’s one of my favorite artists but I’m not sure how consistent he is. Canceled and Blame were two pretty decent singles by him but they didn’t live up to the trap soul era. The mixing and singing by him on this record could have been a lot better IMO. I also think his beat selection has gotten worse. I was bumping it while in the whip and majority of the tracks weren’t hitting.
2062,2020-10-10 03:20:44,j88p7b,Never even heard of black pink...
2063,2020-10-10 00:13:55,j88p7b,"Ofc. I’ve never met anyone who listens to blackpink irl

E: I’m 21 and live in Atlanta I’m not 40. And actually thinking about it I do know one other person besides myself that listens to BP. It may be a bit of an age thing too. I knew way more Kpop fans in high school than I do now in college"
2064,2020-10-10 02:17:08,j88p7b,Lisa from Blackpink has a better flow than most rappers today
2065,2020-10-10 01:01:15,j88p7b,Yea I thought they had a chance to sell more than him
2066,2020-10-10 08:17:34,j88p7b,Lol yeah in the US. They sold 590k globally in one day
2067,2020-10-09 23:48:02,j88p7b,What’s he usually do? I feel like 46k is low for such a big name
2068,2020-10-09 23:35:03,j88p7b,did he do bundles
2069,2020-10-10 02:39:45,j88p7b,yeah. So interesting like.. i thought for sure that was the best album put out in months i don't even know who 80% of the people on that list are so I'm obviously living in a bubble.
2070,2020-10-10 03:25:23,j88p7b,Great album. Loving it a lot
2071,2020-10-10 01:36:49,j88p7b,Pure sales is the real metric of how many fans an artist has
2072,2020-10-09 23:13:31,j88p7b,Baby KILLING IT my goodness. The difference between him and #2 in album units is bigger than the difference between #2 and #7. What a year for him
2073,2020-10-09 22:52:39,j88p7b,it's crazy how many units uzi is selling considering the album kind of came and went
2074,2020-10-09 23:04:42,j88p7b,Still crazy to me just how popular Post Malone is
2075,2020-10-10 01:41:06,j88p7b,I really hope Chilombo goes platinum. It's almost there! An absolutely fucking flawless album.
2076,2020-10-09 23:27:57,j88p7b,i'll never understand the love for lil baby. there are so many artists doing the same thing at a higher level
2077,2020-10-10 04:47:48,j88p7b,Every week no one talks about how Moneybagg Yo has been a staple in the top 25. Who tf knew his album would be up there with some of those other names.
2078,2020-10-10 01:40:44,j88p7b,LIL BABY!
2079,2020-10-10 02:38:14,j88p7b,Damn Eminem still not platinum! Only sold 7k over last week! This is like watching Endgame become the #1 movie.
2080,2020-10-10 03:20:43,j88p7b,Not too bad for someone who’s been in the game for 30 years
2081,2020-10-10 10:44:11,j88p7b,What surprises me is how well he’s doing internationally. A lot of his songs chart high on the global charts in comparison to other rappers
2082,2020-10-09 23:43:42,j88p7b,Very few artists most commercially successful album is their best
2083,2020-10-09 23:53:51,j88p7b,"Imo, So Much Fun, while not experimental, is a way better project than 21's. Most songs on there have great replay value"
2084,2020-10-10 00:58:43,j88p7b,This is for sure 21s best project what?
2085,2020-10-10 04:51:23,j88p7b,They have crazy dedicated fans
2086,2020-10-10 05:03:16,j88p7b,The group had over 60 merch bundles so it's unsurprising. The only group that can sell high in the US without bundles is BTS.
2087,2020-10-10 13:54:33,j88p7b,On probation
2088,2020-10-10 02:45:33,j88p7b,Came here to say this wheres my gravy baby
2089,2020-10-10 00:07:53,j88p7b,I hate sounding like an old head but i feel the same about 95% of new stuff coming out
2090,2020-10-09 23:33:34,j88p7b,Didn’t really do anything for me either
2091,2020-10-10 05:06:58,j88p7b,Yup they're kpop
2092,2020-10-09 23:37:46,j88p7b,Why? Logic always does good numbers
2093,2020-10-10 01:38:43,j88p7b,He had bundles. It’s why his album fell waaaay off second week
2094,2020-10-09 23:51:26,j88p7b,Only did high numbers first week. Dropped out of the top 100 in the second week. 21 did better in streams
2095,2020-10-10 04:02:41,j88p7b,"tbh he has one if the most loyal fanbases in rap, he’ll always do big numbers. if anything i was surprised 21 did this well"
2096,2020-10-09 23:41:16,j88p7b,Why? His album was way better than what 21 put out...
2097,2020-10-10 01:35:20,j88p7b,These are US metrics my guy
2098,2020-10-10 01:20:39,j88p7b,"Blackpink recorded over 1 million pre orders alone for the album, but IDK how much they sold between release and now"
2099,2020-10-10 05:51:28,j88p7b,Very high. No one comes close to blackpink and bts in Asia. Not to mention how popular they are in the states as well judging from their numbers
2100,2020-10-10 10:28:43,j88p7b,"They're predicted to do 1mil+ worldwide, 500k from Korea alone."
2101,2020-10-09 23:43:55,j88p7b,kpop group. probably the second biggest in the world behind bts
2102,2020-10-09 23:46:20,j88p7b,kpop girl band
2103,2020-10-10 00:44:53,j88p7b,"suuuuuuper big kpop group

I enjoy their music alot too"
2104,2020-10-10 00:07:22,j88p7b,"Kpop girlgroup. 

Basically when you start seeing weird ass names in half in all caps, assume it’s kpop
ITZY 
LOONA 
SUPERM
STRAY KIDS 
G-IDLE

2106,2020-10-10 01:02:08,j88p7b,DJ here. BLACKPINK is huge rn with the tweens/teens tik tok group. They're kinda dope tbh. Ice Cream ft Selena Gomez and Sour Candy with Gaga are both bangers.
2107,2020-10-10 05:09:10,j88p7b,Nah I am>I was was ahead
2108,2020-10-10 09:11:28,j88p7b,Well tbf i doubt they have a larger fanbase in america than 21 does
2109,2020-10-10 05:01:40,j88p7b,"He's good for the people that just want some cool rnb. Nothing experimental or brand new just a good vibe and good sound with relatable lyrics.

Bryson just sounds smooth when he sings/raps and a lot of people especially younger people fuck with that style of rnb. He sings like he's spitting game to a girl and also giving honest real life feelings. He's not too vanilla lovey dovey like Daniel Caesar, and he's not too emotionally heavy like The Weeknd.

Again it just sounds like a confident type of rnb that you can ride at night to in a big city with a girl in the passenger seat like PartyNextDoor's early shit. Pretty important niche in RnB imo."
2110,2020-10-11 01:01:11,j88p7b,"Nobody complains about Ozuna or J Balvin on the list, but Blackpink is an issue 🧐"

2112,2020-10-10 02:26:04,j88p7b,"It’s friday every week unless I’m late. Always has been. 

I do sales corrections once the Billboard article comes out, but there’s never any significant shift outside of rare occasions."
2113,2020-10-10 01:45:57,j88p7b,they rap on most of their songs
2114,2020-10-10 01:42:07,j88p7b,Half their album is rap and a lot of it would probably fall under the hip hop genre
2115,2020-10-10 03:21:50,j88p7b,"Pure sales are physical/anything that's not streamed

so merch bundles, digital albums for $10 and physical album sales make up pure whereas streams make up the rest

they dont necessarily matter, so many artists get by fine on streaming numbers but typically older artists/fanbases will get physical albums as opposed to streaming the music, which makes artists like Logic sell a lot of pure albums compared to his contemporaries"
2116,2020-10-10 02:29:59,j88p7b,Pure sales are album purchases as opposed to streams. 1500 streams = 1 pure sale
2117,2020-10-10 04:46:42,j88p7b,37k. 2 weeks ago

2122,2020-10-10 01:40:39,j88p7b,"you know damn well his ass is not releasing this trash year lmao


Edit: I didn‘t say this year‘s music was trash because in all honesty it was one of the best in a long time. However 2020 in general sucks and my remark was referring to that"
2123,2020-10-10 01:41:46,j88p7b,I predict he drops on Black Friday
2124,2020-10-10 01:39:04,j88p7b,rumour says he still plans on dropping this year
2125,2020-10-10 13:55:09,j88p7b,Ski mask please
2126,2020-10-10 01:04:22,j88p7b,"Will Pegasus do numbers like that? I feel like Trippie should’ve released closer to when it leaked, otherwise numbers won’t be as good as they could’ve been."
2127,2020-10-10 04:32:31,j88p7b,I doubt it'll get over 130k. Realistically around 100k I haven't seen any hype outside of the trippie community for it and I've already heard the leak like 3 times and it's not insanely good or anything
2128,2020-10-10 03:09:44,j88p7b,JID's nice but he's not gonna make a serious dent on this chart
2129,2020-10-10 09:32:37,j88p7b,">	He’s just making music for fun at this point

Swear I hear so many conflicting things. Half of you guys say he doesn’t care about numbers and just makes music for fun and the other half say this dude hates making music and only does it when he needs money

Don’t know which to believe because I know he’s said before that he **did not** want to make True to Self"
2130,2020-10-10 05:27:01,j88p7b,bro that song is amazing. as soon as i heard those piano notes i knew it was gonna be peak bryson
2131,2020-10-10 03:53:01,j88p7b,"Ill agree the hype around Tiller isint as high as it was right after trapsoul but the man has been putting out solid, consistently good music for the past 4 years. That's an accolade many other breakouts in R&B and rap that year failed to do so fair play to him. Not to mention 2020 has the lowest hype levels for all forms of media that i have ever seen."
2132,2020-10-10 08:01:22,j88p7b,Yeah like ZUU
2133,2020-10-10 06:48:28,j88p7b,different YG unless this is sarcasm
2134,2020-10-10 10:44:32,j88p7b,Nice
2135,2020-10-10 15:16:00,j88p7b,roll out was kinda lowkey and tailored towards the fans
2136,2020-10-10 00:57:58,j88p7b,"That’s funny because I fucking love true to self. I don’t know why ppl don’t like it. So many bangers on there, and Bryson was spitting a lil bit lol."
2137,2020-10-10 01:33:45,j88p7b,How exactly is *True to Self* weak? Just because its not a retread of *Trap Soul*?
2138,2020-10-10 05:42:52,j88p7b,Yeah I agree I think Bryson inspired a whole new wave of trap soul R&b artists (myself included)  but he himself hasn’t stayed very consistent since his debut unlike an artist like Chris Brown for example . I think True to Self and Anniversary just aren’t good R&b projects personally. I feel he leans too much into rapping on these albums and when he sings it’s in one tone/samey and pretty mediocre. I’d love for him to make a actual R&b album for once.
2139,2020-10-10 01:36:53,j88p7b,you couldn’t take 32 minutes out of your week to listen to the album
2140,2020-10-10 02:08:32,j88p7b,"Nah I think it helped because both had drake features and ones RnB and ones Trap, it was like which side you want your mood to be on. Felt coordinated tbh lol"
2141,2020-10-10 05:00:26,j88p7b,Immensely popular kpop group. Like I would say 2nd most popular behind bts pf course.

2143,2020-10-10 01:00:38,j88p7b,I never met anyone that listens to BTS but they still sold 400k first week and have the #2 song right now
2144,2020-10-10 02:07:08,j88p7b,"when we're in our hiphop bubble it's easy to think that, but Blackpink are HUUGE, this is crazy for 21 n Metro.

Congrats to them they def def deserve it"
2145,2020-10-10 08:48:10,j88p7b,"They are the most popular girl group in the world, odds are you have and just don't know it, unless you live in the middle of nowhere"
2146,2020-10-10 08:01:04,j88p7b,My girlfriend lives them. It's the only kpop group she listens too. I even took her to a concert for her birthday. They actually have a pretty fun show.
2147,2020-10-10 03:51:23,j88p7b,didnt Blackpink headline Coachella last year
2148,2020-10-10 04:09:15,j88p7b,I'm pretty sure I know more people that listen to Blackpink than 21 Savage.
2149,2020-10-10 01:42:22,j88p7b,you probably don't interact with anyone asian then on the real
2150,2020-10-10 00:16:51,j88p7b,I was mostly surprised because of all the stans online who post fancams and probably each bought 5 copies
2151,2020-10-10 04:16:40,j88p7b,Blackpink fucking slaps. If you want I'll zoom with you so that you won't have to say that sentence ever again.
2152,2020-10-10 05:47:52,j88p7b,You are either 40 yrs old or probably live in the middle of nowhere lol
2153,2020-10-10 03:51:09,j88p7b,Because you don’t live in Asia you retard
2154,2020-10-10 17:34:41,j88p7b,"Hahaha same experience with me actually. Went to high school in Alpharetta, knew A LOT of Kpop fans before it even had this wave of popularity (\~10 years ago) and as soon as I got to college that seemed to totally disappear.

I did see that they sold out Gwinnett Arena a few months before COVID started, though, so they definitely have dedicated fans."

The West still loves him. He just stopped making noise in other regions.

Edit: I was wrong, I thought MKL did 100k but it only did 60k. YG has never been a high album seller."
2164,2020-10-10 02:52:57,j88p7b,"Up around 10k from his last album which absolutely surprised me. His last album couldn’t even get above 37k behind Go Loko being such a huge hit, not to mention the huge buzz from Stop Snitchin, so I really thought this was gonna be his lowest selling album to date."
2165,2020-10-09 23:39:18,j88p7b,"I believe so cause I got a digital download when I purchased the 'behind the scenes' book for $25. 

Quick Edit: [Yes](https://4hunnid.com/) If you go to the 4Hunnid website the title of the site is ""MY LIFE 4HUNNID ALBUM BUNDLES""

Either way I'm proud of him for building his 4Hunnid brand."
2166,2020-10-10 18:59:23,j88p7b,I thought Billboard counts them differently now? I could be wrong
2167,2020-10-10 02:59:02,j88p7b,Or it can also be a huge indicator of whose sales are inflated by bundles. For example how a few years ago Brockhampton had a historically large drop off from week 1 sales to week 2 sales.
2168,2020-10-10 03:10:43,j88p7b,This is not true in the slightest what are you even talking about

2170,2020-10-10 01:27:36,j88p7b,"It was kinda weird just how massively hyped that album was and how it disappeared after like 2 or 3 weeks  
  
And maybe its because of the groups I hang around with but I never even see people bumping EA like that  
  
Im not an Uzi fan but was the album mid or what?  
  
Edit: Dude EA is either AOTY or a flaming piece of shit judging by the replies lol  
  
I guess its just a very polarizing Uzi album though"

Just ""edgy"" enough, agreeable, ""trap music is low brow"", simple melodies, the persona"
2176,2020-10-09 23:36:48,j88p7b,Because his songs are fire
2177,2020-10-10 01:41:08,j88p7b,don’t expect to get an in depth response from lil baby fans 😂
2178,2020-10-10 09:12:13,j88p7b,"I really got into him the last years. I dunno, for me it's a combination of two things: for once, I just fell in love with this type of Atlanta liquid guitar trap beats him and gunna are just born to ride. I totally see how his voice can be off-putting, but to me it has a very engaging tone and his melodic, mellow tone often comes off as dedicated and soulful. Listen to his delivery on global or freestyle, I think it really is something special. The other thing tho is how he comes off as really grounded. Yes, his lyrics aren't innovative but a lot of the time he got those moments of shouting out old friends (""I made a promise my n are gonna ball"" is a sentiment I always found really likeable) and I think especially on songs like close friends, time or the bigger picture he seems very self-aware, not thinking to much of himself, not being preachy. I think those factors make him so replayable for me."
2179,2020-10-09 23:32:45,j88p7b,just stop. a non-single off his album does better numbers than many artists' best songs... he makes hits. that's that.
2180,2020-10-10 03:55:42,j88p7b,"He makes good trap songs to work out to, that’s why I like him. Who do you prefer that’s in his lane?"
2181,2020-10-10 01:37:29,j88p7b,Same I just don't get it. I've always preferred gunna when that argument was a thing and I don't really like him either
2182,2020-10-10 22:11:41,j88p7b,I like his features more. Same with gunna. They both have voices that kinda mix up the sound of a song.

2195,2020-10-10 01:45:01,j88p7b,"I mean it's pretty much because mainstream hip hop, which has basivcally become pop now, has saturated the market. because it's the biggest genre and there are so many one hit wonders, it's made soooo many ppl feel like they can do the same, which which makes most ppl in the market sound pretty similar. At least that what I think"
2196,2020-10-10 02:40:12,j88p7b,"i like trap and all but i find myself only listening to stuff that came out from 2015-2017 outside a couple albums. like wunna, etc. they aren't bad but i just can't bring myself to listen to it"
2197,2020-10-10 04:12:18,j88p7b,"A lot of new hip hop isn't all that memorable or impactful for me either. 

If it has a generic trap beat with no real uniqueness, I probably won't remember the song name three months from now unless it's in a playlist."

2200,2020-10-10 05:06:28,j88p7b,The others r jus bullying you but ya I guess ur the type of guy to listen to joyner lucas (I respect logic btw)and I'd say both albums were kinda equal (I'd give sm2 a 6.5 for the fact it was a shitty sequel but a good album and no pressure a 7ish) you need to expand ur taste
2201,2020-10-09 23:56:46,j88p7b,"Interesting, I've never heard of them."
2202,2020-10-10 00:08:41,j88p7b,why they on here though
2203,2020-10-10 01:37:25,j88p7b,this is really random but aren’t these k-pop mega stars basically groomed from birth to be superstars? i found that interestingly sad lol
2204,2020-10-10 02:21:59,j88p7b,"They’re actually really good. Their rapping is surprising good too, considering English is not their first language."

2206,2020-10-10 01:36:44,j88p7b,"I'm tired of that shit bro, send help. My sister blasts them 24/7. The amount of times I've heard Ice Cream, Kill This Love, Do You Like That, Bombaya or whatever it is..."
2207,2020-10-10 22:25:55,j88p7b,Ice cream is one of the weirdest songs lyrically. I can definitely see it as a party song tho and surprising haven't seen it on tiktok.

I am more than willing to admit that I paid the most attention to the BlackPink release this week, and I sound biased on it. I really don't think they'll suddenly overtake *Savage Mode 2.0*, but I'd rather let these estimates be determined on Monday/Tuesday of next week when Billboard formally announces them than try and call it tonight off of projections."

2213,2020-10-10 05:34:07,j88p7b,21
2214,2020-10-10 01:44:47,j88p7b,This year was not trash music wise. He’s definitely releasing anytime from late this year to early next with all the headlines he has next year
2215,2020-10-10 06:32:09,j88p7b,"This year wasn't trash , some great albums were dropped."
2216,2020-10-10 09:06:52,j88p7b,Holy shit Black Friday is going blow the covid numbers so high
2217,2020-10-10 01:21:41,j88p7b,"I feel like its releasing so long after it leaked that people dont even remember that now lol   
  
Plus I always saw leaks as more of an enthusiast thing so the general market will still stream it like crazy"
2218,2020-10-10 06:15:40,j88p7b,"Why do people think leaks have big impact, Im a fan of Trippie but didn't listen to leaked album because I want to hear the actual thing when it drops"
2219,2020-10-10 11:37:13,j88p7b,Trippie usually does about 80k - 100k still does decent numbers and has a solid fan base
2220,2020-10-10 03:13:26,j88p7b,Hey man who knoooows
2221,2020-10-10 17:42:31,j88p7b,"he just did [an interview with genius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg63fT28b_Q) where he went into more detail on where he was mentally the past 5 years. its a really good interview but really long so heres a tl:dr

- it was criticism of trapsoul that initally got to him, leading to him taking more of a backseat on true to self while he let the label try to kinda direct the album

- ever since true to self dropped he's been recording songs for a project, serenity, that he said he really liked but still wasnt totally sure they were good to drop (he mentioned later that the songs from that album will likely be dropped in the near future)

- in january of this year he had a legal deposition that i guess inspired him to start fresh on a new record that had a nostalgic lean towards trapsoul. he didnt go into too much details about what the deposition was about tho, just that it motivated him

basically i think he's always wanted to make music and loves doing it, he just got into a bad rut creatively and started overthinking his work which led to almost nothing coming out the past few years aside from like a handful of short loosies"
2222,2020-10-10 10:02:58,j88p7b,"I might be wrong here but afaik his Grandma died around April/May of this yr and she was one of his biggest inspirations and supported him from day 1, her death has probably given him a lot of motivation to make music"
2223,2020-10-10 06:22:25,j88p7b,"The only part that kinda ruins it for me is that sample has been used so much already, and I have another song I love that uses the same sample very similar so it's weird."
2224,2020-10-10 08:56:05,j88p7b,I wanna live in the world in which west coast rapper yg is the one to found the k pop Label and now just hangs out in the blackpink videos Diddy-style so bad
2225,2020-10-10 08:01:54,j88p7b,Lmao it is a sarcasm
2226,2020-10-10 01:36:44,j88p7b,"I enjoyed it myself, but based on the critical reception a lot of his fans didn't feel it"
2227,2020-10-10 02:36:23,j88p7b,"i think that true to self is great but i think it gets a little repetitive, still like it though"
2228,2020-10-10 07:57:48,j88p7b,"Second this! Idk why true to self gets so much shit, I get it wasn’t anywhere near as good or similar to trapsoul but how many artists struggle to follow up their debut’s.... a lot."
2229,2020-10-10 01:37:51,j88p7b,"Personally I liked it. But I'm saying that based on the lackluster critical reception and Tiller himself publicly stated he was depressed while making the album and it wasn't what he wanted it to be. I wasn't expecting a retread of TS, but I also think he wasn't fully invested in that album."
2230,2020-10-10 05:52:55,j88p7b,You got some examples of your music I could hear?
2231,2020-10-10 03:04:54,j88p7b,"No, I’m not that big of a fan. Would rather throw on SM2, but if the only new album last week was Tiller then I would’ve checked it out"
2232,2020-10-10 05:41:38,j88p7b,"Holy shit. 1.3 billion views. Yes it’s been 2 years, but still."
2233,2020-10-10 09:02:00,j88p7b,Wtf 1.3 billion??? How have I not heard of them before this album release
2234,2020-10-10 05:22:28,j88p7b,[deleted]
2235,2020-10-10 01:41:22,j88p7b,I actually know quite a few BTS fans irl but zero blackpink fans
2236,2020-10-10 03:18:56,j88p7b,Shit i listen to BTS....guilty pleasure
2237,2020-10-10 03:30:12,j88p7b,“Sold”
2238,2020-10-10 02:52:05,j88p7b,"also i'm too old to be hanging with kpop stans, a lot of them are teenagers"
2239,2020-10-10 10:33:41,j88p7b,I remembered now I do know someone who listens to them. I checked fb and I know someone else who’s liked their fb page. They really don’t have much competition in terms of girl groups though so that statement doesn’t mean much. Little Mix is the only other active girl group I can think of and they’re mainly only known in Europe
2240,2020-10-10 20:40:04,j88p7b,Not headline but they were there
2241,2020-10-10 13:32:53,j88p7b,Yea
2242,2020-10-10 02:10:29,j88p7b,Yup. Im in the Philippines and it’s mad popular. They even play some kpop songs on the radio channel which does top 40/pop hits/etc.
2243,2020-10-10 19:25:52,j88p7b,"I mean, I don't really interact with any k-pop stans because almost every single one I've ever met IRL or online have obnoxious or juvenile personalities.

it's a stereotype but in my anecdotal experience, it's largely true"
2244,2020-10-10 01:00:21,j88p7b,they did do 103k pure which is nuts nowadays
2245,2020-10-10 01:40:44,j88p7b,Most of the album sales go to the Korea charts. Globally they sold a shit ton.
2246,2020-10-10 10:09:48,j88p7b,I’ve heard their stuff lol
2247,2020-10-10 10:31:28,j88p7b,I’m 21 (lmao) and live in Atlanta
2248,2020-10-10 10:18:15,j88p7b,These are the American sales charts ma’am
2249,2020-10-10 00:35:51,j88p7b,This is sales in the US
2250,2020-10-10 05:48:27,j88p7b,Rose and jisoo better
2251,2020-10-11 00:36:57,j88p7b,"They’re not lying

“Love to Hate Me” a random song on their album, skip to 1:55 - https://youtu.be/wlzGXcTzdzU

You can also listen to “Playing With Fire”."
2252,2020-10-10 02:07:16,j88p7b,Kinda sad. I prefer their output over BTS.
2253,2020-10-10 03:03:26,j88p7b,"He’s still making noise in other regions but it’s just the singles

His singles are bigger than they’re ever been on this and the last album"
2254,2020-10-09 23:54:33,j88p7b,Yo this album slaps tho.
2255,2020-10-10 01:13:01,j88p7b,"You’re right, he’s regionally popular and  doesn’t have the success of global artists like drake"
2256,2020-10-10 01:39:07,j88p7b,That shit be at Zumiez
2257,2020-10-10 03:09:09,j88p7b,Ah is that also counted under pure sales? Good point then
2258,2020-10-10 04:15:13,j88p7b,"Artists with dedicated fanbases like YG always sell a lot pure. Most people who listened to Savage Mode 2, for example, just listen because Metro and 21 are big names. I listened even though I'm not a big fan of either (it was boring as hell btw), so I contributed to the sales."
2259,2020-10-10 01:25:21,j88p7b,"And its not even by a small amount  
Baby is outselling The Weeknd by like 350k which is kinda insane to think about"
2260,2020-10-10 01:09:13,j88p7b,"My Turn released February 28.

After Hours released March 20. 

A three week difference, but Lil Baby has been carrying that momentum all year. Meanwhile, The Weeknd hasn’t had much after his album."
2261,2020-10-10 01:06:21,j88p7b,About a month after
2262,2020-10-10 10:38:57,j88p7b,"Baby also released a lot of deluxe tracks a few months after the original release

But Baby’s songs always seem to have a lot of longevity. I swear Freestyle was the most played song in Atlanta for like two years straight"
2263,2020-10-10 02:15:02,j88p7b,"The albums got super mixed reception. Like two of your responses say its his worse but imo as a kinda big Uzi fan I think it's definitely in his top 3, possibly his strongest body of work overall. I think a lot of Uzi fans didn't like it because they just want him to be melodic and shit and he spends most of the album straight up rapping."
2264,2020-10-10 01:29:56,j88p7b,IMO both versions were great tbh. Some of the tracks on the first and second are some of his best work
2265,2020-10-10 02:12:49,j88p7b,I personally loved EA. I think it is probably a candidate for album of the year.
2266,2020-10-10 01:39:30,j88p7b,"EA in my opinion is by far the worst Uzi project released. I listened to it when it released and haven't listened to a single song on it again. Luv vs. the world 2 wasn't very good either, but there's at least 2 songs on there I listen to every couple weeks. Almost like falling off a cliff in quality from Luv is Rage 2 in my opinion."
2267,2020-10-10 01:57:12,j88p7b,"To be fair the album (albums) dropped like a week before lockdown. He sorta stopped promoting it after that for some reason. Also I think dropping two big whole projects a week within each other doesn’t work well, it’s overwhelming. Only thing that’s good is more sales."
2268,2020-10-10 09:15:50,j88p7b,"I’ve listened to Eternal Atake almost every day since the album came out.
On last.fm i have 750 scrobbles on Eternal Atake and 340 scrobbles for Lil Uzi Vert vs the world 2."
2269,2020-10-10 02:02:44,j88p7b,EA part 1 was the worst project Uzi has ever dropped IMO. The 2nd part was much better but still overall a weak album from him because of how horrible part 1 was
2270,2020-10-10 03:18:44,j88p7b,I hear people bump Silly Watch and Celebration Station every so often but people don't really bump it like that. Most people that I know still like the album tho
2271,2020-10-10 00:51:49,j88p7b,[deleted]
2272,2020-10-10 01:27:41,j88p7b,Bro that’s for a post album that dropped back in April of 2018 doing those numbers in 2020. That’s insane longevity
2273,2020-10-10 01:23:24,j88p7b,not really considering he hasnt dropped anything this year. it also says he sold double polo g
2274,2020-10-10 01:26:04,j88p7b,that album came in 2018
2275,2020-10-10 21:01:10,j88p7b,"He,'s doing crazy numbers is all i'm saying, i get why he's popular bro! He caters to more than 1 demographic that's for sure"
2276,2020-10-11 03:21:21,j88p7b,You mean generic shit. He’s literally a plant
2277,2020-10-10 01:41:57,j88p7b,"fr lil baby fans salty asl in my replies rn lmfao

this is what im talking about tho, his fans think hes SO GOOD, i just don’t see it at all"
2278,2020-10-10 13:32:25,j88p7b,Lil baby has a lot of good music.
2279,2020-10-09 23:41:12,j88p7b,Lil Baby got it but Abel has 3x his Spotify listeners. It's surprising to see Baby above him
2280,2020-10-09 23:42:35,j88p7b,ok? just cause he's commercially successful doesn't mean i have to like his music lol
2281,2020-10-10 03:57:41,j88p7b,"Roddy Ricch, Uzi, Dababy, hell even Gunna"
2282,2020-10-10 00:01:39,j88p7b,">very few artists

Also graduation was more successful"
2283,2020-10-10 02:06:44,j88p7b,"well, it was a lot easier to move huge sales back then (before streaming). See: Eminem, 50 Cent, Lil Wayne, etc."

2285,2020-10-10 10:09:15,j88p7b,> very few
2286,2020-10-10 01:34:33,j88p7b,"Honestly thats kinda why i fuck with it    
  
I love experimental and weird Thug but So much fun was literally just that  
  
So much fun  
  
I just cant help to be like ""Surf surf surf surf yee"" with a stupid ass smile on my face anytime that comes on  
  
Its not his greatest project by far but i appreciate that someone like Thug can still release just fun ignorant music"
2287,2020-10-10 00:20:54,j88p7b,"I mean, sure it is stripped down, but I don't think that makes it a bad project. There's just a lot of bangers on it with dope production and Thug still is interesting on it"
2288,2020-10-10 05:07:30,j88p7b,Agreed. I was listening to some early thug today and it made me realize how comparatively bland much of his stuff today is and how ahead of his time his. 2014-2017 stuff was
2289,2020-10-10 01:29:04,j88p7b,How when ever project after has been more diverse and he’s improved even more as a rapper/artist?
2290,2020-10-10 02:27:37,j88p7b,Damn ppl rly sleeping on Issa and without warning
2291,2020-10-10 01:47:35,j88p7b,"i am > i was is my fave personally, then savage mode. SM2 is alright I guess, have to listen to it some more and see if it grows on me."
2292,2020-10-10 01:12:22,j88p7b,How? 21 has literally improved and every way as an artist. Those projects are solid but incredibly one dimensional. This project is incredibly diverse and versatile...how can it not be his best
2293,2020-10-10 10:45:38,j88p7b,Some of them yeah. I hate telling people I'm a kpop fan because of the extremist side.
2294,2020-10-10 14:27:01,j88p7b,Tbh its really Atlanta being so goddamn generic and everyone sounds the same from there. A QC collab album sounds like any migos album
2295,2020-10-10 01:55:53,j88p7b,"Yeah I agree with you 100% but I wasn't talking about the one hit wonder tik tok rappers or whatever. Tbh I don't listen to those guys lol. 


The mainstream rappers are just dropping dogshit albums and people are eating it up like it isn't something that literally could have fit in perfectly 3-4 years ago. Not that that's a bad thing (or that most people even care) but it's just boring when there's no innovation. there's barely any effort + the bar is so low to be successful so they don't need to try which sucks"

The lyrics were better 

The flows were better 

Savage Mode 2 was a cash out. Metro worst production of any album. 0 effort was put into this. Its a major downgrade from I am > I was which was a legitimately good project."
2299,2020-10-10 01:46:20,j88p7b,Maybe cause Logic actually tries and attempts to put thought into his lyrics lol
2300,2020-10-10 05:08:20,j88p7b,True I always hate the people who think they are the elitists cause they listen to logic

I listen to DOOM; madlib, gibbs, wutang, aesop, etc. 

Joynera ight.

>you need to expand ur taste

I listen to more genres of music than you. You are such fucking idiot honestly like expand my taste. You listen to the most bland pop rap imaginable. I don't need some mouth breather telling me I need to expand my taste because I thought the most bland 21 album was bad."
2303,2020-10-10 00:17:09,j88p7b,"They have female rappers in the group, but still probably a stretch to put them here."
2304,2020-10-10 00:28:51,j88p7b,Their album had a cardi feature so that might be relevant ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
2305,2020-10-10 00:58:20,j88p7b,They rapped on more than half the album.
2306,2020-10-10 09:05:40,j88p7b,"They have quite a bit of rapping in their songs. 

Examples:

[BLACKPINK - Pretty Savage] (https://youtu.be/hx-PQXhdpks)

[BLACKPINK - Crazy Over You] (https://youtu.be/4VOMHN6M4Dw)

[BLACKPINK Love To Hate Me] (https://youtu.be/VE3i4_3fdA0)"

2309,2020-10-10 01:41:19,j88p7b,They have a few good songs no lie but their shit is so samey and gets old fast .. especially when you're not the one playing it lol

2317,2020-10-10 12:57:01,j88p7b,That’s exactly why people didn’t like it. Didn’t meet standards for fans
2318,2020-10-10 17:01:10,j88p7b,"How are you gonna call an album you actually like 'weak'? But now that you mention it he does sound like he's in darker headspace on that album since  it's tinged with paranoia and a certain arrogance that wasn't there on *Trap Soul*, but I think that worked in its favour to differentiate it from that one. The biggest slight I have against it is its length, since it really didn't need to be that long."
2319,2020-10-10 06:14:13,j88p7b,Sure here’s Spotify https://spoti.fi/34GOOQi
2320,2020-10-10 16:03:41,j88p7b,"Probably because you move in different musical spheres. There are probably kpop fans who've never heard of immensely popular rappers like Travis Scott, Megan, NLE, Cardi etc. Likewise, there are probably artists with billions of plays in other genres or countries that I dont know about."
2321,2020-10-10 06:05:13,j88p7b,Lots of great and interesting kpop groups imo - not too sure why all the gravity went to Blackpink of all groups... just sounds like they're performing over rejected diplo cuts from 2016.
2322,2020-10-10 02:04:54,j88p7b,the opposite for me.
2323,2020-10-10 02:12:02,j88p7b,What is bts
2324,2020-10-10 10:37:53,j88p7b,I actually really enjoyed their Tiny Desk
2325,2020-10-10 16:56:28,j88p7b,"Me too man, probably watched the boy with love video a thousand times"
2326,2020-10-10 05:41:56,j88p7b,"Me too, bro. Me too"
2327,2020-10-10 06:32:12,j88p7b,What the fuck
2328,2020-10-10 03:46:49,j88p7b,so are a lot of hip-hop fans
2329,2020-10-10 03:38:34,j88p7b,Alot of them are in their 20s also
2330,2020-10-10 10:30:04,j88p7b,I think this is it. I knew a decent amount of kpop fans when I was in high school. Barely know any in college
2331,2020-10-11 02:05:26,j88p7b,"Jaden Smith is known to be a fan of Blackpink, they have some decent tracks"
2332,2020-10-10 10:46:57,j88p7b,"They have damn near limitless competition in China, Korea, and Japan alone. Those countries shit out girl groups unlike anything you've ever seen"
2333,2020-10-10 14:45:44,j88p7b,Bro philippines top 50 charts in spotify is full of blackpink songs. They chart better in the PH than even in korea lol
2334,2020-10-10 19:28:43,j88p7b,"well I mean, it just depends where you are in the world. it's not only kpop fans that listen to BP, large amounts of average Asian-American people listen to them. most of the stans you meet, you wouldn't realize they're stans because you only know if the people who make kpop their entire personality."
2335,2020-10-10 07:59:31,j88p7b,"I saw a PolyMatter video a while back where he claimed that streaming never really took off in Korea, and K-Pop groups sell these like collectors physical albums"
2336,2020-10-10 02:18:20,j88p7b,Yeah they are predicted to sell 1 million worldwide.
2337,2020-10-10 07:01:26,j88p7b,I would’ve argued with Jennie but ok
2338,2020-10-10 03:06:52,j88p7b,"He's actually good at curating hits. 

Big Bank

* Nicki Minaj - East

Go Loko was pretty big last summer as well and has 250m streams on Spotify"
2339,2020-10-10 01:32:26,j88p7b,It really does. Played it through yesterday and enjoyed it. Better than expected.
2340,2020-10-10 02:41:10,j88p7b,Nipsey Hussle sold 30K Pure for Victory Lap. It’s definitely regional.
2341,2020-10-10 16:03:36,j88p7b,"it's pretty fucking insane. I didn't pay attention to the whole thing, but I don't think it has as much quality as After Hours. Don't forget the weeknd has been hot since like 2013"
2342,2020-10-10 05:04:38,j88p7b,"However, blinding lights is still top 10 after like 43 fuckin weeks. That is nuts to me"
2343,2020-10-10 02:02:51,j88p7b,"wym, Weeknd has been releasing singles, at the MTV awards, releasing music videos, etc."
2344,2020-10-10 01:48:25,j88p7b,Yeah for real I genuinely think EA is one of Uzi’s best albums
2345,2020-10-10 09:18:43,j88p7b,"Strange how different opinions can be. I loved my first listen of the album and have listened to it almost every day since it released. 
Prices, Venetia, Lo Mein, Bust Me & Baby Pluto are all great uzi songs imo"
2346,2020-10-10 20:08:51,j88p7b,"Seriously, part one is almost exclusively hot ass. Years of hype and bitching about his not being able to release music and shit and that’s what he drops? Shit was worse than TBD."
2347,2020-10-10 01:29:29,j88p7b,Not really
2348,2020-10-10 22:10:03,j88p7b,I was like what is bbab doing in here?
2349,2020-10-10 01:47:13,j88p7b,His voice is so grating to my ears I just cannot stand him. Swear all these hhh users are flocking straight from Twitter or something cause if you don't completely love their favorite top 100 rapper they're gonna piss their pants
2350,2020-10-10 02:05:50,j88p7b,"> this is what im talking about tho, his fans think hes SO GOOD, i just don’t see it at all

2351,2020-10-10 14:02:38,j88p7b,I never thought about it that way

2353,2020-10-10 01:32:34,j88p7b,Spotify isn’t the only streaming service. It’s possible his Apple Music + YouTube numbers compensate.

2355,2020-10-09 23:46:31,j88p7b,"You were saying that you dont understand the love that he is getting, no one is saying you have to like his music"
2356,2020-10-10 12:16:34,j88p7b,Yea I got u I’m not a huge gunna fan unless it’s his features and even then he is hit or miss for me same with roddy rich except I only like a couple of his songs. I think it’s just personal taste
2357,2020-10-10 16:08:23,j88p7b,"should I give roddy a chance? I only really like 3 songs of his, and I could care less about his features"

2359,2020-10-10 02:00:47,j88p7b,"> i appreciate that someone like Thug can still release just fun ignorant music

that's... pretty much all of his music. lol. if you're listening to young thug for profound lyrics you're looking in the wrong place. he is probably my favorite artist of the last 2 years btw. but it isn't shit for the thinking man."
2360,2020-10-10 00:29:17,j88p7b,"Maybe it's just me, but I felt like he didn't experiment as much with his voice like on previous projects like BTG, Barter 6 etc. He played it safer, which paid off, but for me it was a little too similar to everything else that's coming out. I was kinda baffled by the reception, but the lead single (The London) definitely bangs"
2361,2020-10-10 10:37:30,j88p7b,"Only savage mode is one dimensional. How are you gonna tell me a tape with Pimp, Out the bowl, and Slaughter your daughter on it is one dimensional. 21 may be a better rapper but his delivery is a lot less interesting and raw than it was in his early mixtapes"
2362,2020-10-10 23:54:03,j88p7b,"I somewhat agree but Atlanta isn't just QC and that's it. U also have artists like JID, Earthgang, 6LACK, deante hitchcock. And realistically it's only migos, lil baby and lil yachty singed to QC"
2363,2020-10-10 03:07:16,j88p7b,y'all sound miserable honestly lmao
2364,2020-10-10 03:56:45,j88p7b,What artists?
2365,2020-10-10 05:08:23,j88p7b,"I try not to hate on mainstream rappers because I don't want to sound like a hipster, but I think the biggest problem I have is that while they can make some pretty good songs, they never seem to do anything consistently attention grabbing. Basically they can make some good singles but making an entire album of that quality is a lot harder. I love some the 21 songs recently but listening to the whole project puts me to sleep."
2366,2020-10-10 19:49:15,j88p7b,like chief keef? yea but i guess i have some nostalgia thing w shit that came out 2015-2017 too so i just sit around listening to future's 2015 run all day lol
2367,2020-10-10 02:50:50,j88p7b,nobody listening to 21 savage for the deep lyrical life lesson content bruh
2368,2020-10-10 02:04:36,j88p7b,21 puts a lot of thought into his lyrics. it's just not a lyrical album.
2369,2020-10-10 06:43:07,j88p7b,Found the Nathan
2370,2020-10-10 17:00:39,j88p7b,This isnt elitist at all man just said the album was better lmao
2371,2020-10-10 13:22:47,j88p7b,I hate people who project. I never said I was an elitest. I think I'm an elitest because I don't type these brain rot tier comments on reddit.
2372,2020-10-11 13:09:10,j88p7b,Did I say that?
2373,2020-10-10 13:41:06,j88p7b,"Yeah being pretty immature, I have a similar hip-hop taste as you have and I can say all the examples you gave fall all around the lyrical category, 21 savage may not hold a candle to them but just because he doesn't fit a dictionary or write poems in his song don't mean it cant be good cause I know 21 savage can be way more catchy than doom and easop easily and if you think that only lyrics matter than you are just sad (I was like you when I was 12 lmao) also instead of assuming I'm a ""bland pop rap fan"" (nothing wrong with that) why not just acknowledge most people don't want to go on genius and think about the lyrics. Maybe you really do need to expand your music taste to the ""shitty mainstream hip-hop"""
2374,2020-10-10 02:20:33,j88p7b,ye even bts got their own rappers too their rappers drop their own mixtapes every now and then shit goes hard
2375,2020-10-10 00:36:02,j88p7b,Lmaoooo I read that as Carti the first time and checked fast as hell
2376,2020-10-10 10:33:46,j88p7b,then were gonna post maroon5 albums on here too
2377,2020-10-10 10:33:25,j88p7b,"still a stretch, they arent even posted here.  
  
its pop/kpop not hiphop or rnb, listen to the album lol it’s not relevant here. if the reason is ""rapped on half the album"" you reaching"
2378,2020-10-10 19:31:28,j88p7b,don't make it hip-hop.
2379,2020-10-10 12:44:54,j88p7b,"because they were the one actually mentioned here lol, i'd say the same for them if they were on it. 
  
dont get why some people are hellbent on forcing certain artist that clearly arent hip hop or rnb adjacent on here."
2380,2020-10-10 08:15:41,j88p7b,"To be fair though, most current rappers sound 'samey' from track to track. Same old types of beats, same flows, same recycled bars, it's still all dope in that it's fun to listen to, but it's also just as uninventive really lol"
2381,2020-10-10 02:16:38,j88p7b,"I don’t consider myself a music snob, maybe even bordering on “basic” (will unashamedly say I like drakes music for example) but I can’t really get into KPop. I guess I’m in Asia and it’s saturated as f on my feed and on the radio. Some of it is catchy tbf"
2382,2020-10-10 03:19:50,j88p7b,"Plus, everybody’s well aware of how he was most likely gonna drop earlier this year but cancelled due to all the festivals being cancelled. And yeah you’re right about the music video too"
2383,2020-10-10 03:27:46,j88p7b,And not for nothing but punch was requesting people with video editing skills pull up right now to the studio. Happened just a few hours ago on Twitter. He deleted it so I can remember the wording exactly 🤷‍♂️
2384,2020-10-10 17:50:03,j88p7b,"I don’t think so, delaying an album twice over cancelled headlines isn’t a smart move"
2385,2020-10-10 17:48:48,j88p7b,"anytime man. the interview has a lot of other really cool little tidbits too about the creative process of his music and  personal life and stuff, dudes really likable"
2386,2020-10-10 22:56:29,j88p7b,"Because I'm referring to his sales and reception by fans and critics when I say weak, even if I liked it. Hell, I'm a musician and even though I like my own projects, they're all ""weak"" by my own definition."
2387,2020-10-10 07:28:27,j88p7b,"I fuck with you bro, here's mine if you're interestd [https://open.spotify.com/artist/4GBBSQV6GgsacMiPRcIJvt](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4GBBSQV6GgsacMiPRcIJvt)"
2388,2020-10-10 16:26:06,j88p7b,Over a million streams my man this is you fr or cap?
2389,2020-10-10 19:22:01,j88p7b,Why did you list NLE in that group lmao
2390,2020-10-10 07:04:28,j88p7b,">just sounds like they're performing over rejected diplo cuts from 2016.

Finally found the words. I like the music they put out but it always sounds like something else left on the cutting room floor."
2391,2020-10-10 06:55:03,j88p7b,It's just how they're marketed YG really has built the hype around them due to 2NE1 and BigBang so they easily got their hands on some international fans because BP has a pretty different image from the usual K-Pop cute concepts that were the trend around the time they were rising in popularity.
2392,2020-10-10 16:04:58,j88p7b,What are some other groups you recommend
2393,2020-10-10 02:49:25,j88p7b,"Korean boy band, probably the biggest musical act in the world right now."
2394,2020-10-10 02:48:14,j88p7b,K-pop boy band that's really big right now
2395,2020-10-10 17:34:33,j88p7b,Shit the production values for their videos are insane
2396,2020-10-10 06:03:22,j88p7b,ever go to a barbershop? lots of old heads lol. Kpop is ore of a recent thing (in the west at least) so the fanbase skews younger.
2397,2020-10-10 19:33:37,j88p7b,"I guess. Chicago's asian-american population isn't particularly high (it's increasing tho).

I did know a few pop in Toronto that listened to it, but they were Koreans. Maybe people bump it and just don't tell others"
2398,2020-10-10 08:52:57,j88p7b,Yes it's true. Physicals outweigh streams in Korea/Japan by far.
2399,2020-10-10 16:57:29,j88p7b,Jennie hottest by far
2400,2020-10-10 03:09:07,j88p7b,I think go loko is his biggest song
2401,2020-10-10 04:06:12,j88p7b,jealous x rodeo x hate on me
2402,2020-10-10 10:14:35,j88p7b,It might break the longest time spent in top 10 at this point. I thought when post set it with circles it would last longer lol.
2403,2020-10-10 01:50:40,j88p7b,"it definitely is, alot of the really popular snippets got official releases and hes definitely improved as an artist as well. The whole theme of the project was really good as well."
2404,2020-10-10 16:05:29,j88p7b,"his voice can be really jarring sometimes, and pretty cool other times. I don't get the hype but We Paid fucking slaps"
2405,2020-10-10 03:47:00,j88p7b,I tried to listen to one of his songs and was immediately annoyed.
2406,2020-10-10 02:09:00,j88p7b,wow its almost like im stating my disagreement with their opinions
2407,2020-10-10 03:48:53,j88p7b,"There's not enough differentiation between the products to suggest inconsistencies in popularity between artists, especially those that have primarily American audiences. If it was a Spanish artist vs English though, that might be the case."
2408,2020-10-10 10:41:51,j88p7b,Exactly. Blinding lights and his older pop singles are probably on everyone’s playlists
2409,2020-10-09 23:48:37,j88p7b,He doesn’t understand because he isn’t a big fan. I kind of feel the same way I find him generic most of the time even if he has some songs I think are more interesting like bigger picture. Don’t understand how he’s so much more popular than other artists in his lane
2410,2020-10-09 23:47:21,j88p7b,"yes, i dont understand why he get so much love because i think his music is bad and i do not see the appeal. is it really that difficult to understand"
2411,2020-10-10 16:09:41,j88p7b,I would! Imo “Please Excuse Me For Being Antisocoal” is one of if not the most consistent project out of the current trap wave
2412,2020-10-10 00:04:10,j88p7b,It’s been out longer. Graduation had like twice as many first week sales and more successful singles
2413,2020-10-10 01:44:08,j88p7b,"Holy shit, I never knew TCD was that successful. That's crazy."
2414,2020-10-10 02:37:28,j88p7b,how accurate are those numbers tho. the source is 2014 and artists have to request for their certifications
2415,2020-10-10 03:16:16,j88p7b,wait TLOP went double platinum and was the most illegally downloaded album of all time?? how tf did Ye follow that up as an album that sold less than 100K units
2416,2020-10-10 03:06:20,j88p7b,">that's... pretty much all of his music. lol.

Not really.   
Lots of his songs and projects are a lot darker in vibe  
The ignorant part is still there but its just less playful   
   
Most if not all of SMF is very upbeat"
2417,2020-10-10 05:45:39,j88p7b,Generic beats with the same recycled features are what sells i guess
2418,2020-10-10 05:03:54,j88p7b,I am bro I just wanna listen to something new like man I have been so deprived of hiphop I have been expanding to other genres
2419,2020-10-10 12:18:26,j88p7b,Take any album that was in the top 100 and it probably fits this description
2420,2020-10-10 03:04:40,j88p7b,Oh so thats why his shitty music is so good
2421,2020-10-10 02:35:32,j88p7b,Must have a brain the size of a walnut then cause its all pretty generic shit
2422,2020-10-10 13:48:09,j88p7b,"No it's just not a good project thats it. Stop with this fucking Bullshit oh it's just different. No it's not. It's a dogshit project. I love future, young thug, early Travis. Like stop with this fucking Bullshit dude. Project sucks nuts. God fucking  dammit talking to you brainlets is so fucking annoying. First you are telling me to expand my music taste. Now your telling me I just don't get the appeal. No I listen to this type of rap aswell. This is just a dog shit project. Fucking christ."
2423,2020-10-10 00:44:17,j88p7b,man yall carti fans are funny lol
2424,2020-10-10 22:22:26,j88p7b,Honestly facts. If everyone knows them as kpop then why we tryna pretend they hiphop
2425,2020-10-10 13:25:44,j88p7b,A lot of international music isn’t posted here because it’s mainly an English sub
2426,2020-10-10 12:47:35,j88p7b,I like K-pop but I can't definitely understand not being into it especially if your social feed is over saturated with it.
2427,2020-10-10 03:43:18,j88p7b,Kenny video this weekend 👀
2428,2020-10-10 18:35:44,j88p7b,It’s not really delaying it if they never had a release date in the first place. Also I have a feeling kendrick has quite a lot to say about what’s going on In America rn
2429,2020-10-10 23:14:49,j88p7b,"Exactly. Most artists are incredibly bias and hard on their own work, that's why I tend to kinda ignore what they say about it.

Critic reception seems fine, Pitchfork gave it a 6.6 for example, and it sold 100K first week, debuted at #1 and went Gold so sales were definitely good too. I honestly think it's just the fans trashing it and wanting more *Trap Soul* that's coloured the perception for this album."
2430,2020-10-10 16:20:53,j88p7b,Dope I like the pop sound keep pushing those releases
2431,2020-10-10 19:52:52,j88p7b,"Fit is cool, you should rap more"
2432,2020-10-10 20:59:59,j88p7b,"Idk, I just thought of the most popular rappers that came to mind. The shortta flow series collectively has like a quarter or maybe even half a billion views on youtube. Idk, there are better examples like Migos, Drake, Future and Kendrick. But nle came to my mind first, probably cuz I was listening to him more recently."
2433,2020-10-10 16:11:23,j88p7b,"Twice - &TWICE

ODD EYE CIRCLE - Max & Match (not Mix & Match)

Red Velvet - Summer Magic

Sunmi - Warning

Loona - X X

April - De Capo

DREAMCATCHER - Dystopia: The Tree of Language

Orange Caramel - Catallena

Red Velvet - 4 Walls


These are full lengths and EPs by girl groups that I believe to have some of the best music coming out of the industry. It's also a very entry level list but it's great for people who think kpop is too much blackpink and BTS and not enough anything else. If you have general weird biases against pop music these wont like convince you that theres magic hiding here (dreamcatcher might actually) but if you like pop music you should be able to appreciate the creativity and energy here. 

Theres a lot more I could reccomend like specific songs and boy groups and stuff but I think this is a fine enough start. Enjoy!"

yes hip hop has always had political and societal undertones but it was never the main focus of hip hop, it was about the parties that these MC’s were mc-ing.

i see no difference now in the mainstream than what it was when i was growing up in the early 2000’s. 

i think people just don’t like the fact that the trap sound has taken the mainstream and that’s what’s dominating the radio"

Second man shut the fuck up we get it you listen to future and young thug it still does not give your opinion a fact worthy status on the new album by 21. you're immature man like you can't actually say why the album is ass and you have to go for the person behind the argument not the argument itself.

Also 21 album had amazing production, catchy songs and the cool morgan freeman documentry and I'm saying to appreciate both no pressure and sm2 and not act like a elitist .

Early 2000s had a shit ton of classic albums that are certified GOATs (or at least considering to be in the top 50), just off the top of my head;

Marshall Mathers LP

The Blueprint

Get Rich of Die Tryin'

The W

Roc la Familia

Like Water for Chocolate

Devil's Night

2001 (even though it released two months before Y2K it still counts in my opinion, it has an early-2000s sound).

Stillmatic

The College Dropout

The Documentary

The Black Album

Restless

Man Vs Machine

I'm sure I'm missing many more, but the run from 1999 to 2005 was a fantastic period for rap, both mainstream and underground. 

Meanwhile, ever since 2013 onwards it kind of feels like mainstream rap has degraded in quality and became a lot more appealing to the common denominator; I mean seriously, other than TPAB and maybe 4:44, did we really get any mainstream behemoth that shook the entire culture like we got with GROT and MMLP? Nah, at best, we got ""very well made albums"", and that's pretty much it, we haven't had a top 10 classic in a long time."

I thought I didn't listen to mainstream music? Now all of a sudden I do? I never said it was a fact worthy status? Mind quoting me on that.

>you're immature man like you can't actually say why the album is ass

I have... Look at my other comments. 

>you have to go for the person behind the argument not the argument itself.

Because the person behind the argument is a mouth breather who has consistently lied...

First you say i don't listen to mainstream music and think it's bad 

Now your saying that I think my opinions are facts. 

You have consistently lied about me and what I believe. 

>Third you're not even worth spending more time on, have a great day

i honestly think it comes to a preference of sound though. i think looking back we’ll probably be skewing the definition of classic anyway. personally i believe “Culture” by Migos is a classic hip hop album because of what it did for themselves as artists but also just the trap rap genre as a whole. i know a lot of people would probably disagree with me but I think it’s a very important piece of work from the 2010’s"
2499,2020-10-10 22:19:20,j88p7b,"I don't listen to albums normally, but The GOAT by polo g is a great album and is a voice for the black community which seems to be something you like."

After the South African group Die Antword's ' Fatty Boom ' video scandal, Nicki Minaj came out to Gaga's defense after a parody that was made by the group. In an interview for an English magazine Nicki Minaj was questioned:

-''' What do you think about Die Antwoord's new video? ''
-' ' A shit completely, I saw it on the same day of the premiere, I saw myself painted on a wall with several of my fellow artists and we were labeled that we were a demon or some shit like that, when I saw Gaga I was very angry because I felt that he they wished death and I said how the fuck can you mess with an artist as big as Gaga, Youtube shouldn't allow those shit videos.

But in their short by Harmony Korinne for example, they talk about how no one takes them seriously. They want to be taken seriously and they want to be respected and that’s why they’ve went to such great lengths to keep this up. There’s two conversations - the mainstream would bring them up as villains and respond to their disses which only serves to verify their relevance. But I feel separating the artist from the person, they also are qualified to be talked about academically because of their artistic contributions to pop culture/rap."

Phonograph records are an *electrical* process. The audio is converted into a groove which ""wiggles"" back and forth and up and down. The stylus traces that groove and creates an electrical signal, which is converted back into audio that humans can hear by the amplifier and speakers."

There are a few artists I absolutely do not want to support or whose voices/styles annoy me so I never want them played, but I like other similar music from other artists and I don’t want the algorithm to think, for example, I don’t like altpop because I blocked or “disliked” Melanie Martinez.

They are always so over the top dramatic - like yeah it's not a horrible song and a lot of people like lady gaga, but how does her singing have anything to do with perfume?

2637,2020-10-08 16:00:24,j7f8qr,"That's true, especially for Rina as she has one album and one EP out, but small discographies didn't stop us from rating Lorde for example (who has two albums and one EP. Dua has two albums, but her first album is large enough to be two albums on its own with its Complete Version).

I based those choices more on recent popularity, as Rina and Dua's albums occupied the top 2 albums in our last AOTY event, but they are not set in stone. I will add a google form in which you can send your recommendations for future TTPTs, may even switch some artists in this schedule with them. I will provide a list of artists that can't be rated at the moment in the form, because they have an album coming soon and that would make their TTPT irrelevant in a very short amount of time.

Putting remixes are not encouraged, I combine them with the original song if they are not significantly different. I think I will only allow collaborations that are not feats. (ex. Charli XCX & Christine and the Queens - Gone can be included in both artists' TTPTs, but Blame It On Your Love can't be on Lizzo's TTPT) There will be exceptions for artists like Nicki Minaj/Pitbull of course, whose featured discographies overshadow their actual discography in terms of size."

2642,2020-10-08 18:02:33,j7f8qr,"You are right about that. She has a very extensive discography, I wouldn't want to see the results skewed by putting her close to Christmas (like the last time! How did I miss this?). Instead of switching her with someone else here, I will most likely change her spot with an artist that I was planning to include in the second cycle.

I hope we follow the rule of the former, there are so many amazing remixes and collabs on these artists."
2649,2020-10-08 17:31:17,j7f8qr,thanks. Although it still needs a re-do because Countdown should be nowhere in top 5

Tbh I had no idea that the timing would actually affect the results that strongly, and apparently this has already happened before.

Kylie could work, but I want to give her a little more time ^^(hah). Disco will be released in November, so I think mid-late January/early February would fit best to avoid recency bias."

2706,2020-10-08 14:32:11,j7bubr,"THEY HAD AN EPISODE CALLED BAD REPUTATION AND DIDNT DO JOAN JETT?! 

Seriously tho, I always thought that was a huge missed opportunity. Literally Quinn could have done the song and it would have been perfect for her arch. It makes so mad. 

But instead they do “do you wanna touch me” where Paltrow sing it to high school students…"

2708,2020-10-08 13:24:29,j7bubr,"quinn would’ve eaten sofia by clairo, or anything by clairo tbh. 

WAP performed by santana, mercedes and brittany. 

911 by tina 👀"
2709,2020-10-08 14:38:57,j7bubr,I could see Rachel doing LWYMMD when she doesn't get every solo in a competition
2710,2020-10-08 14:20:01,j7bubr,"Santana and Mercedes would’ve killed Rain On Me.

Artie would rock Don’t Hurt Yourself by Beyoncé.

Santana and Brittany should do Slumber Party.

Don’t Start Now would’ve been a great group number.

Again, RIP Naya, my favourite actress from the show. I loved her character and her voice so much. May she rest in peace."
2711,2020-10-08 14:30:13,j7bubr,I swear Chord was supposed to sing I Knew You Were Trouble in the Guilty Pleasures episode. I have no clue why they cut it.

2713,2020-10-08 13:58:45,j7bubr,what if Mercedes does BGE? omg
2714,2020-10-08 13:38:44,j7bubr,"Long Live should've been their final song because the lyrics is just so apt. It perfectly describes their journey and even their wins at Nationals. But nooo, they did I Lived.

>The time we stood with our shaking hands  
The crowds in stands went wild  
We were the kings and the queens  
And they read off our names

Rachel could've covered Thank You For The Music if they had an ABBA week because the lyrics fit with her character:

>I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore  
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before  
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing  
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing

Taylor Swift's Holy Ground would fit with Santana and Brittany's story when Santana moved to New York. 

>Tonight I’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through.  
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you.

I would've been happy with Santana covering any and every song in the world. But maybe some Kacey Musgraves would be nice."
2715,2020-10-08 15:40:19,j7bubr,"Given that I can't hear the original version of Van Halen's Jump without expecting Rachel's belting note over the guitar solo, I'm not entirely sure I'd want them to do more, but here goes...  

Billie Eilish - Bad Guy. Sung by Alistair. Obviously.  

I think Jesse St James would be good for a song or two from Hamilton, can't think which ones though. Maybe My Shot? Or It's Quiet Uptown?  

I'd like to see punk/alternative Quinn brought back and explored further, maybe covering some Meg Myers or Poppy.  

Also a female empowerment episode: one of the guys makes a sexist comment. The Glee club is split into girls and boys for the week, with the guys having to do songs performed by female artist, whereas the girls have free reign. Everybody learns a lesson at the end and is happy. Songs:  
* Hailee Steinfeld - Love Myself. Sung by a shy character who breaks out of her shell for the episode before being reset for next week (Marley? Tina?). The whole thing is played completely straight despite the obvious fact that the song is actually about wanking.  
* Fifth Harmony - That's My Girl. Closing song, sung by the boys (and Will!) to an audience of all the women who have ever been in the show, logic/transport/continuity be damned.  
* Queen - Fat Bottomed Girls. Mercedes sings this because of some vague body positivity message.

I have a lot of thoughts about this show and the potential from the first season that was wasted, but I have a very good therapist who is helping me work through them."
2716,2020-10-08 18:31:19,j7bubr,Girlfriend by Avril Lavigne! I’m honestly surprised they didn’t do it as the song was massive back in its day and they did Keep Holding On. I can see this done by Quinn and Santana.
2717,2020-10-08 14:01:42,j7bubr,"TLC- Unpretty

Doja Cat- Streets

Janet Jackson- That’s the Way Love Goes

Beyoncé- XO"
2718,2020-10-08 19:48:12,j7bubr,i can see tina quitting glee club after being disrespected for the 100th time and singing look what you made me do
2719,2020-10-09 00:58:59,j7bubr,"Songs I think Quinn should've sung:

* I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman - in the first Britney tribute episode. Would've made sense story-wise as it would've been after she had given birth and her trying to make sense of her identity at that point.
* Material Girl - in the Season 2 prom episode. Would've been a fun number that suited Quinn's characterisation at that point.
* Lucky Star - Dianna could pull off a young Madonna look and had a quite a high voice early on, so this would've been a cool number for the Madonna episode.

Songs I think Tina should've sung:

* Reflection as mentioned above
* Never Let Me Go by Florence + the Machine - this would've been a really good competition number
* Also think she would've sounded great on a Kylie Minogue song like Come into My World

Also, Artie and Santana should've duetted on The Way You Make Me Feel by MJ back in Season 2 when Brittany was dating Artie and Santana was figuring out her sexuality."
2720,2020-10-08 15:49:06,j7bubr,I wish they could have sung Circus by Britney Spears as either a group or as a duet with Brittany and Santana
2721,2020-10-08 21:49:24,j7bubr,Into You by Mercedes would’ve been so well. I also see the Unholy Trinity doing God is a woman
2722,2020-10-08 13:55:12,j7bubr,Any Kylie Minogue song.
2723,2020-10-08 13:52:22,j7bubr,I’ve been rewatching it and there’s honestly so many songs that would have ATE. Although the storylines we would have gotten with the tik tok songs would have had me facepalming so hard. I don’t even want to know what they would have done with Say So
2724,2020-10-09 03:15:38,j7bubr,i totally agree with OP about them doing more Journey. sure there was the joke they did all their songs but there were so many great Journey songs they didn’t record.

2726,2020-10-08 14:55:11,j7bubr,Idk by the time the show was ending the covers were getting pretty bad so I’m actually thankful most of the time lol but the original Glee crew would’ve done well with Don’t Start Now
2727,2020-10-08 20:04:23,j7bubr,I've never seen this show but I know Jonathan Groff was in it and so of course his character would have to do You'll Be Back from Hamilton.

2729,2020-10-09 02:38:26,j7bubr,I just realized Quinn could have sung She Used to Be Mine!!!
2730,2020-10-08 15:08:38,j7bubr,Ultraviolence
2731,2020-10-08 14:18:04,j7bubr,"Don’t start now

2732,2020-10-08 15:51:23,j7bubr,"I’m already seething just imagining it like those episodes where they pretended they weren’t treating Tina like shit and having her going into hallucinations to do some mental gymnastics of ‘Oh no, Rachel actually has it worse’"
2733,2020-10-09 00:51:01,j7bubr,"Jenna was the most underrated singer on the show and no one can change my mind on that (she does really good belts in the background on Hate on Me). The fact that her first solo was heavily autotuned (True Colours), and so many were cut short and not released was so unfair."
2734,2020-10-08 18:22:59,j7bubr,"Yeah, exactly why I saw it that way too 😞"
2735,2020-10-08 15:24:40,j7bubr,"> But instead they do “do you wanna touch me” where Paltrow sing it to high school students…

A song written by a convicted sex offender and actual paedophile, no less!"
2736,2020-10-08 17:32:23,j7bubr,"In fairness, the theme of that episode was songs that **have** a bad reputation, and I don’t know anyone who dislikes Joan Jett. 

Quinn **would’ve** killed that song though, but you just know they would’ve given it to Rachel."
2737,2020-10-08 13:54:54,j7bubr,but done by Schuester.
2738,2020-10-08 14:13:29,j7bubr,We joke but Santana and mercedes would've killed this
2739,2020-10-08 18:27:52,j7bubr,This could be a Santana-Kitty duet but idk how will that happen lol
2740,2020-10-09 00:36:29,j7bubr,the only way this would be acceptable would be if it were performed by Naya Rivera and Amber Riley but you know they would make Lea Michele do it and/or Jane Lynch and the shoe.
2741,2020-10-08 13:50:13,j7bubr,"Shit, 911 would fit Tina!! Her falsetto is one of my faves, and it would certainly fit her in the prechorus"
2742,2020-10-08 16:33:31,j7bubr,sofia would be perfect for her omg 😭 if only they had the guts to explore her sexuality.
2743,2020-10-08 18:21:58,j7bubr,Or Sunshine coming back and singing this to Rachel lol
2744,2020-10-08 18:32:02,j7bubr,They changed it to Copacabana lol.
2745,2020-10-08 14:21:00,j7bubr,Amber's (or RILEY's) EP is actually really good.
2746,2020-10-08 16:15:25,j7bubr,"Santana singing Rainbow by Kacey Musgraves to Brittany would have been amazing. 

Like if Brittany was having a rough time and really sad/down, then Santana comes in with Rainbow? 😭"
2747,2020-10-08 18:48:38,j7bubr,"Marley singing Dandelions by Kacey Musgraves at some point about Jake would have been really nice, but I guess it's a lesser known one so they wouldn't have gone for it anyways"
2748,2020-10-08 17:49:03,j7bubr,"Jonathan Groff, who plays Jesse St James, actually originated the part of King George in Hamilton so I think there’s your Hamilton song choices right there lol. 

Puck actually sang Fat Bottomed Girls in S2 to Lauren Zises"
2749,2020-10-08 18:34:28,j7bubr,Girlfriend would be a KILLER Cheerios number!
2750,2020-10-08 14:16:41,j7bubr,"They’ve done Unpretty, in a mashup with I Feel Pretty"
2751,2020-10-08 18:24:41,j7bubr,"XO would've been a great proposal song. I would imagine it as a Blainetana duet, or maybe a re-arranged version during the double wedding"
2752,2020-10-08 21:50:36,j7bubr,The way I know Santana would’ve done Streets so well
2753,2020-10-09 02:37:21,j7bubr,I like these choices!! IMO Quinn and Tina should also have one more duet. So Far Away was immaculate
2754,2020-10-09 02:35:44,j7bubr,Into You by Mercedes! Yes! Sounds like a good song after she gets married and finally has sex during the honeymoon.
2755,2020-10-08 18:25:37,j7bubr,"Marley, Brittany, Madison, or Kitty would kill it either as a solo or a group number"
2756,2020-10-08 18:26:48,j7bubr,"I could definitely imagine Say So as a Mercedes-Santana duet, but like ""Like a Virgin"", while they sing it separately to Sam and Brittany during a sexy scene"
2757,2020-10-08 20:40:39,j7bubr,Right?! It was so awkward especially when her character is portrayed as the hot sexy teacher.
2758,2020-10-09 03:16:44,j7bubr,i thought they were doing it as like a joke
2759,2020-10-08 20:41:27,j7bubr,I feel like it would have worked for Quinn because she trying to let go of her reputation. But definitely racheal would have sang it.

2761,2020-10-08 13:56:48,j7bubr,"Schuester and Sue would’ve done a duet unfortunately :/

2764,2020-10-08 18:29:35,j7bubr,I’m loving the Tina appreciation here. She’s definitely one of the strongest and most versatile singers on the show but was criminally underutilized and ignored throughout the show’s run. Fück Ryan Murphy lmao.

2767,2020-10-08 15:34:31,j7bubr,her live performance is even better
2768,2020-10-08 17:54:42,j7bubr,"> Puck actually sang Fat Bottomed Girls in S2 to Lauren Zises  

Dammit! I thought he'd covered it but I've managed to erase it from my memory, and the Fat Bottomed Girls Wikipedia page didn't mention it so I figured it was a fever dream! Thank you for clarifying

> Jonathan Groff, who plays Jesse St James, actually originated the part of King George in Hamilton so I think there’s your Hamilton song choices right there lol.  

That was kinda my joke :P"

2772,2020-10-08 20:50:44,j7bubr,"Oh it would’ve 100% worked for Quinn. After season 1 her character really went to shit, but in season 3 she was literally dressing like a punk rocker and had her hair dyed pink and people were like “Quinn stop you’re gonna ruin your life” and she’s like “cool, don’t give a shit”. 

LITERALLY THE PERFECT SET UP but nope. Botched it.

Hell, her and Santana could’ve done a duet of it at literally any point in the show and it would’ve fit."

It would be the performance of a century. We could only be so fortunate."

2776,2020-10-08 18:35:56,j7bubr,"They really did Tina dirty. She was an amazing and refreshing character in Seasons 1-3 and they ruined her characterization in 4-5, they made her look bad. Much like how they made Sam stupid S4 onwards."

2779,2020-10-08 18:41:01,j7bubr,"Character wise, I think S3 was the best. She was the nicest in that season with helping Mike and Rachel with their college problems and being a total team player. S4 is where they turned her into a horrible diva (she’s gotten funnier tho lol) then S5 is just idk, she officially became the “Meg” of Glee. Jenna is a total pro for sticking with them til the end."

2783,2020-10-08 14:38:30,j7bqq0,"I’m going to get downvoted but I think “Cool” wasn’t it.  They just debuted in 2017, and they been recently building a fan base. They had a sound and a signature concept. Teen crush, very quirky, slightly cute, slightly sexy. Can’t fantagio just wait a bit more until the group gets older and the fandom bigger before changing their concept? The song is ok but this management won’t help."
2784,2020-10-08 18:12:54,j7bqq0,"[Weki Meki](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCGZK5dPJk6p6x2n6obqULg) is clearly underrated as a group so I won't blame you for making post about them. 

Although I pre-ordered their album I didn't pay attention to [Cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHikmx0eVXM) release date so thanks to you I checked it out. It's very good, the music is going to need some getting used to as far as I'm concerned, because it feels a little over the place on a first listen. However the cinematography is striking for such a small group M/V. The sets and wardrobe fits very well the whole theme. The editing is great, no superfluous cut. No stupid camera movement. Finally the CinemaScope aspect ratio give the M/V a high production value look for not much money. Great job to everyone involved. 

Oh and Suyeon is so gorgeous in this video!"
2785,2020-10-08 14:03:36,j7bqq0,"I’m always here for the stan Weki Meki agenda!

Cool is such a good song, I always expect quality from them, but I was blown away by it. I actually gasped at one point during the MV because they really did THAT. The song still has their fun Weki Meki vibe, but with more of a cool girl vibe to it and I love this concept for them. They can pull off anything and I am always impressed with the variety in their songs. I really hope this one gains them more fans because I’m tired of them being so under-appreciated!"
2786,2020-10-08 18:38:29,j7bqq0,"The video is so gorgeous. The first verse and the prechorus are literal perfection. The rest of the song I admittedly still have to get used to, but after enough listens I could see myself bopping to it."
2787,2020-10-08 14:06:20,j7bqq0,all the bg stans that complain about ggs always doing cute or feminine concepts better support weme bc my girls gave them everything they asked for and then some 🗣🗣
2788,2020-10-08 19:15:09,j7bqq0,saw a comment on the mv and it's so true. cool is like a popular b side that actually became a title track
2789,2020-10-11 01:57:05,j7bqq0,"If you watch their pre-debut practices and covers, Weki Meki practiced a lot to [hip hop and R&B tracks,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChQ0QDcoUUc) like Beyonce/Rihanna/Ariana (and occasionally [after they debuted,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQYfnZ3civs) too), so it's not actually that much of a stretch for them to go into non-cutesy territory.

I suspect they started off with teen crush because maknae Lucy was literally still in middle school when they debuted. She just turned 18 two months ago and is the only member remaining in high school, so it's probably about time for Weki Meki to turn to more mature concepts, similar to how Astro eventually pivoted from their young and sunny concept."
2790,2020-10-08 15:29:48,j7bqq0,"admittedly, i'm biased, but i don't think this is too big a departure from the weme that we know. i think keeping their singature individuality while pointing the group in a new direction is a good move, especially because there's no real evidence that their previous schtick was working and that the fandom was growing. this is where i disagree with you.

the numbers actually show that their sales have been *de*creasing. there's no reason to believe that doing the same thing they've been doing so far is gonna make the fandom get bigger, so their current strategy seems rather smart to me. they didn't pull a complete 180, so the fans weme *does* have won't leave, but they're making some changes in hopes to attract more fans."
2791,2020-10-08 16:29:07,j7bqq0,"Tbh I don't see how this is a concept change at all, this is feels in line with the direction they are already doing before"
2792,2020-10-08 15:53:47,j7bqq0,"or that gg choreo is"" tooooo easy"" (excuse me while my eyes roll into another dimension)"
2793,2020-10-08 15:42:16,j7bqq0,"Of course their sales were decreasing. They had some hype on their first releases because of IOI. They’re still a nugu girlgroup, from a nugu company. In my opinion Picky Picky grabbed a lot of attention mostly from I-fans. Dazzle and Oopsy followed the same sound. And Oopsy was the first mini album were all songs actually charted. In my opinion, that was an improvement. And this is definitely different from the previous releases. The outfits, the colors, the chorus. Concept changes usually won’t work in groups with unstable fan-base. Not even mentioning the fact they’ve changed their concept 2 times already. I really like the girls but I wish Fantagio was more consistent with their marketing strategy. This is giving me CLC flashbacks."
2794,2020-10-08 16:01:58,j7bqq0,"oh, definitely. oopsy was a really good improvement for them comercially, but to me oopsy *was* a change and cool follows in that same direction, that's why i don't necessarily see the inconsistency. let's hope this mini does well!"

Kelela is the artist I've listened to most this past decade ([feel free to peep my last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/BiPolarBear17/library/artists?date_preset=ALL)) so making this list destroyed me, all her songs & albums are immaculate and have meant so much to me through different periods of my life. I'm sure this list would look completely different in a month cause it's impossible to rank her discography 😭😭😭 Shout-out to [Keep It Cool](https://youtu.be/NWPRYUHebSY), my favourite Cut 4 Me track which just missed out on my top 10, and [Melba's Call](https://youtu.be/iprGdZfZe1k) which I couldn't include cause it's only a feature 🥺"

2854,2020-11-09 17:46:50,jqz6i7,well born this way is her best album by far so this list is very true and correct and valid

2856,2020-11-09 18:06:38,jqz6i7,Before I Cry being the lowest ranked official release *hurts*. It’s not a top 10 Gaga song but it’s still really fucking good
2857,2020-11-09 23:57:44,jqz6i7,Um why isn’t million reasons in the top 10??
2858,2020-11-09 23:34:56,jqz6i7,"Someone help me see the Heavy Metal Lover light 😭 I just don't get the hype around that song

Dance in the Dark rising to the top 10 and Sexxx Dreams, Bloody Mary, and Replay in the top 20 feels correct.

I think when it comes to ranking Gaga songs her biggest singles will generally always be at the top because they appeal to and are known by the most people. I don't think that necessarily means they're the absolute best Gaga has in her catalog though... Like, Always Remember Us This Way - at 28. WHAT? And I considered putting I Don't Know What Love Is in my top 10 but I couldn't find a spot... I guess no one else could either :("
2859,2020-11-09 17:21:34,jqz6i7,Heavy Metal Lover on there over any songs from Artpop and Chromatica???? Y’all make me SICK

I know you bottoms would do Joanne dirty, but at least Traumatica was kept out of the Top 10."
2865,2020-11-09 17:04:22,jqz6i7,Am I the only one that believes Judas has aged *incredibly* poorly?
2866,2020-11-09 18:32:15,jqz6i7,glad to see judas getting the love it deserves. also really surprised that the top 10 was only BTW and TFM

2871,2020-11-09 16:43:41,jqz6i7,"I love gaga but if even the gayest sub on the internet is not ranking any of her recent output highly that’s a real problem...

Especially if some of the gays (like me) are starting to find these songs sound very dated and stuck in the early 2010s. 

Maybe I have just overplayed the fame monster and born this way too much, but I seriously cannot sit through them front to back anymore. 

I liked chromatica but it wasn’t her best. she really needs to find a sound that is a real hit with her long standing fans but also modern. Imagine peaking at your first record / EP... 

I know she has had success with both Asib and  chromatica, but to give you context when I went to her Vegas show (dressed in drag with my friends on Halloween oop) the couple next to
us were 2 people in their late 50s who were there because they “loved ally”, and left halfway through the show because gaga was swearing too much. (To be fair, they probably would have enjoyed the jazz show much better). 

I just don’t think she can maintain a fan base split between fans who only like her first two albums and new fans from c2c/Joanne/asib who like the “mature” gaga but not the crazy out there gaga. Chromatica kind of tried to do that with dance music but I don’t think it worked for either side honestly."
2872,2020-11-09 21:59:25,jqz6i7,"what on earth are Alejandro, Marry the Night, and I'll be the one to say this: Paparazzi doing above every song off of ARTPOP/Joanne/Chromatica/ASIB"

2883,2020-11-09 22:01:29,jqz6i7,I like how it was used in Five Foot Two. Had to double check what album that was from when I heard it used in the Joanne doco
2884,2020-11-09 22:25:43,jqz6i7,I really thought it would be much higher up......people on this sub are basically obsessed with TFM but they still paid its best album track DUST

2902,2020-11-09 22:01:31,jqz6i7,"> Imagine peaking at your first record / EP... 

Except The Fame is arguably her worst album 💀 it's not even particularly loved within the fandom. Like yeah it was a massive success and very influential, but her songwriting, vocals, and production have clearly grown past her debut. 

> but to give you context when I went to her Vegas show (dressed in drag with my friends on Halloween oop) the couple next to us were 2 people in their late 50s who were there because they “loved ally”, and left halfway through the show because gaga was swearing too much

2903,2020-11-09 20:40:32,jqz6i7,"I had a mix of all her stuff minus her movie, collab with Tony Bennett, and The Fame Monster. I am sd most of this full of singles and Born This Way."
2904,2020-11-09 18:44:03,jqz6i7,"I agree, the title track especially has aged like milk"
2905,2021-04-02 18:10:08,jqz6i7,I just don't like the way the album is mixed. To me it sounds like every instrument is pushed to the front of the mix so it makes it hard to distinguish sounds/instruments and it makes the album sound unnecessarily busy imo
2906,2020-11-09 21:58:55,jqz6i7,"I mean, I love all these songs, but it's fairly homogenous. I would have liked to see her last 3 albums represented (and maybe even ASIB).

Also genuinely sad Telephone didn't make top 10 when it's my fav song of all time. It would have gone number 1 if it had Beyonce *nd* Britney as features."
2907,2020-11-09 23:52:23,jqz6i7,"seriously though. so many people are caught up on nostalgia and aren't appreciating the more recent/newer ""hits"""
2908,2020-11-09 21:50:52,jqz6i7,Could be because people are tired of Shallow.
2909,2020-11-11 07:39:36,jqz6i7,ASIB is one of the most beige and bland albums I’ve ever listened to. I’m glad it was paid dust. Too bad Chromatica wasn’t much better...
2910,2020-11-09 15:56:03,jqz6i7,"Even though I love Chromatica (it's my most-streamed album this year), imo she's got so many songs that are arguably and easily way more iconic and influential. I might've included some if this way a top twenty though, namely Rain On Me or Replay so I'm happy that they made the top twenty!"
2911,2020-11-09 19:06:28,jqz6i7,Chromatica is in the top 20 tho. ASIB and Joanne are the ones with no entries even in the top 20. She just has too many iconic songs in her earlier albums and people seem to mostly rate by popularity and iconicness.
2912,2020-11-09 15:52:32,jqz6i7,I personally didn't include Chromatica in my top because it's way too recent and I wasn't able to include her new songs with her older songs!
2913,2020-11-09 22:00:31,jqz6i7,"I don't think it says anything about Chromatica, but points to a nostalgia bias. This sub pretends like pop music peaked in 2008-2012, and those were the years Gaga ruled the world.

Sad to see people downvote you though, for a fairly innocuous comment."
2914,2020-11-09 17:03:45,jqz6i7,You are probably thinking about the discography event held by /u/radiofan15

2917,2020-11-09 22:02:50,jqz6i7,"No I didn’t say it was weaker, and not really sure about the downvotes. 

I like the later gaga, but I was saying from the above ranking it is clear her target fans as a whole prefer her older stuff. And her “newer” less likely fans only want to hear her new serious stuff. So she’s kind of stuck trying to satisfy both now"
2918,2021-04-08 14:28:54,jqz6i7,"It’s not though- literally that album has some of her best songs on there ex: Marry the night, which imo is her best song so far"
2919,2020-11-10 09:21:13,jqz6i7,"Telephone is definitely my favourite after Bad Romance. Also no Art Pop or Joanne is crazy, I get they have a different sound but Joanne is my favourite and Art Pop is seriously underrated."

that being said, these numbers arent bad at all. anti by rihanna debuted w 166k and that was a huge album. And 100k-300k has always been where ariana falls when it comes to album sales. like rihanna, shes known to the public more for her hit singles and personality. not really concerned about it, and it feels like she is starting to step out the box at her own pace. my hair and love language are clear indications that shes growing and not stalled creatively like many reviews try to say."
2964,2020-11-09 13:09:52,jqrqml,"firstly, she still got a #1. that's huge and congrats to her. 

there are a few factors behind the low sales. i think the two most important ones are the new billboard rules and the timing of the drop. 

the new rules don't count merch or tour ticket bundling, and physical copies count the week they're shipped rather than the week they're sold. this is especially impactful for vinyls, as those sell a lot but they take forever to manufacture. with the new rules, taylor's folklore drop isn't doable any more (tons of merch bundles, 16 different physical versions, selling vinyls that aren't made yet and won't ship for 3 months). ari didn't even do preorders, positions had 7 physical versions and one lot of signed CDs that sold out in under an hour. i think if she'd had preorders and vinyls ready, numbers would have been higher.

in terms of timing, i think the election definitely played a role. i'm not american but multiple americans on popheads mentioned listening to very little music last week because they were just tuned into CNN 24/7. i'd be curious to know the impact of the election on listening as a whole, maybe spotify will release numbers. 

other factors are the minimal promo (some social media stuff and one zach sang interview), the lack of pop banger lead single, and the style being different from tun. she's also always been quite low with pure sales.

that said, i think it's fairly clear that she wanted a low-key era. she chose the timing, she clearly wasn't aiming for another culturally impactful moment like tun releasing the weekend before the election. there's a lot more promo and sales stuff she could have done but didn't. i interpret that as her not being too bothered about making this a huge moment, and a continuation of her just release music when she wants to vibe."
2965,2020-11-09 11:24:29,jqrqml,I think her life being “normal” right now has a lot to do with it to. Taylor dropped that album and everyone knew there would def be references to scooter and the label stuff. Sweetener and tun happened after really big events in aris life. Right now she’s in a good “uneventful” time in her life so she’s probably not as interesting to random people if that makes sense. But positions hands down is one of my fav albums
2966,2020-11-09 20:41:53,jqrqml,"i mean, sales are dead but positions was handled terribly. the fact that it got leaked was bad, the album cover was lazy and the album as a whole was lacking in quality, sorry. i know it’s covid but the promo was horrible too. she could have done something more like idk, a livestream."
2967,2020-11-09 05:38:39,jqrqml,Bundles rule
2968,2020-11-09 05:37:07,jqrqml,"it is interesting. i personally loved the album as well (it’s my favorite one overall!), but I think the GP was probably expecting something on the same level as TUN. i assume because it was so iconic and even people who weren’t ariana grande fans had heard about it. that being said i’m so glad she went with her heart and made an album like this instead of playing it safe"
2969,2020-11-09 08:44:59,jqrqml,"Bundles such as signed cd's and any other additional items Included in the album total sales such as the alternative album covers were not included in the total sales. Positions has the highest one-week total for an album since bundles stopped factoring into chart and sales rankings. however, the new bundle rule came into place last month and not many huge artists on Ariana's level have released since then so that's not saying much lol. 

I do think the reasoning for low sales is becaue she played it very safe. The production and lyrics in tun were very impressive, however for positions they were mediocre and no songs really had a wow factor like most did in tun. 

Also the album leaked 4 days before the release date and almost everyone had already listened to the album and that would have had a big effect on the total sales.

Also it's worth noting positions had more first week streams that all her other albums bar tun (obviously lol). I believe we are in the streaming era and more people are streaming on platforms like Spotify and apple music rather than actually buying an album. Ariana is definitely a streaming artist and not an album seller. This could also be down to the fact the majority of her fans are from the current generation. Someone like Adele would have big pure album sales but maybe not as high pure streaming sales becaue her fans are from the older generation."
2970,2020-11-09 12:41:48,jqrqml,She should have prepped tons of bundles like signed CDs or even vinyl etc
2971,2020-11-09 15:50:38,jqrqml,"The pure sales is obvious. 

Streaming wise, I’d say a combo of the lead single not immediately sticking the landing for *a lot* of people, plus - that’s right - the whole thing leaked almost a week in advance, and *a lot* of people listened to it. 

I’m tempted to say over saturation played a role too, but her tweet got over a million likes, almost a million retweets etc. Seems to me like enough people didn’t care for the lead and skipped the album altogether. 

Who knowssssss exactly why tho"
2972,2020-11-09 05:46:52,jqrqml,I blame Scooter
2973,2020-11-09 07:27:41,jqrqml,"You're right. I think both worked as promo tactics. Ari using two weeks and a single as promo, Taylor using dropping the album in less than a day as promo. Each of them did their part of doing promo. But the success of their projects varied drastically. 

Hmm, but compared to Ari's past albums, she sold 300k for TUN and 200k for Swt. 100k is a big difference from 300k. It's practically half of what her last album did. She's lower than DW numbers back in 2016 when she's at the top of the game now. 100k to 300k is a huge range. 

I agree that My Hair is jazzy and unlike what she's done before. I enjoyed that. Yet the fact that most reviews feel like she's playing safe does indicate that she hasn't progressed much creatively. 

To me, I think progress is overrated. I dont mind if she dabbles the same genres over and over again as long as the music continues to sound good. I don't care much for evolution as long as the quality stays, but I guess the GP does."
2974,2020-12-11 10:17:49,jqrqml,"To be fair, Taylor's had big sales for years. She's always been more of an album artist, whereas Ariana is a singles artist"
2975,2020-11-09 11:38:04,jqrqml,"I absolutely agree. I think I've mentioned it before on other posts but it's sad that an artist's relevancy is tied to an extent to a tumultuous personal life. With a greater downfall comes greater highs and greater investment from the GP. 

I hate grief porn but I think a lot of the fanbase is guilty of that even though I know they don't have any ill intentions. I try my best not to indulge myself in that, which means I always ignore any possible references to Mac in her music. I don't care to know or discover it. I'd much rather let him rest in peace and enjoy her music for what it is."
2976,2020-11-09 20:50:56,jqrqml,"I’m sorry but reducing Taylor’s strength in album sales to just being about scooter and the label stuff seems extremely wrong. Especially folklore is a critically acclaimed album that took people by surprised and the fact that we didn’t even know she was referencing those things until we heard the album close enough (I certainly wasn’t expecting her to sing about it and also those things were referenced only in like 2 songs at best). The reason why Taylor has strong album sales AND streaming numbers wasn’t because people were interested in her personal life. She literally said folklore isn’t about her personal life (although you can make some connections about her personal life). Again, reducing Taylor’s hard work and taking a risk to switch from a pretty poppy album like reputation and lover to a more subdued album like folklore seems insulting. Of course maybe that’s not what you meant but the idea is; you make good music, people will listen to it, it doesn’t matter if some big event happened in the artist’s life or not."
2977,2020-11-09 05:45:00,jqrqml,Ariana did do signed CDs if I'm not wrong
2978,2020-11-09 05:42:09,jqrqml,"That's an interesting take. I agree that they expected TUN level of quality, and didn't get that. 

But the funny thing is, a lot of reviews say that she's playing it too safe in Positions. For example, I found this here:

https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/08/ariana-grande-positions-review"
2979,2020-11-09 08:53:36,jqrqml,"I see. That was an interesting and insightful take. I agree with many of your points. Thank you for sharing!!

(And omg I remember the leak now. That's probably one good reason.)"
2980,2020-11-09 15:51:39,jqrqml,Can’t do that anymore unless everything is ready to ship on release week.
2981,2020-11-09 15:54:16,jqrqml,"Yeah, you're right, I keep forgetting about the leaks. That played a part too, for sure. :(

Yeah, I went to popheads and a lot of people were confused how her Tweet announcing the album got a million likes but her album sales didn't exactly match that. Beats me too"
2982,2020-11-09 05:51:47,jqrqml,Why? Why do we have to blame her manager instead of holding the artist herself accountable to a degree? I don't want to blindly idolize someone to the point that I'd always push the blame to somebody else
2983,2020-11-09 15:08:37,jqrqml,"Hmm I think there were a whole bunch of reasons for one Taylor was able to use merch bundles before the rule came into effect that they wouldn’t count as sales, also the fact Ariana’s album leaked days before it dropped, then it being election week she wasn’t really posting much about it either, also I think if she had dropped another video to go with the album release that would’ve helped alot, but I would say Ariana’s release was a lot more messy then Folklore’s release, for me the music was great but the rollout was awful and idk what Scooter was thinking with this..."
2984,2020-11-09 05:50:40,jqrqml,"ehh she didn’t even signed a lot, and taylor’s album dropped right before the rule was set there was a bunch of different versions of her album on release and ariana didn’t even have a preorder link for this album as well. Billboard also said this was the highest one week total since the bundles stopped, so this low number was expected for me."
2985,2020-11-09 05:55:32,jqrqml,"Imo she did play it safe. She made an album in which she slightly departed from her usual stuff but still managed to sound like a bunch of music that could have effortlessly fit in previous projects. It obviously wasn't bad, but even some of her most devoted fans can recognize that it wasn't something fresh"
2986,2020-11-09 05:45:31,jqrqml,ooh yeah I actually can see that point as well! I guess I assumed a more typical pop sound would be considered “safe” but reading that I definitely can see their point!
2987,2020-11-09 15:53:22,jqrqml,That was my point
2988,2020-11-09 08:23:30,jqrqml,Lol it's always when an artist does bad blame the management but when an artist does good all credit to the artist
2989,2020-11-09 05:56:30,jqrqml,"You may be right, but you're indicating that this lack of a merch bundle option accounted for about 200k worth of difference of sales compared to TUN, or 600k difference in sales from Folklore? Taylor had an edge with the merch bundles, yes, but Ari had two weeks of hype to build before the album release, and Taylor had less than a day. Ari also had a single out a week before.

While it might explain Ari's drop in sales, this huge decline cannot be attributed fully to that."
2990,2020-11-09 17:26:02,jqrqml,"Oof my bad, missed “prepped.” Got you."
2991,2020-11-09 08:24:11,jqrqml,Agree lmao
2992,2020-11-09 06:01:34,jqrqml,"Your right on that one because many thought this would have been another thank u next, but obviously it wasn’t. But Taylor is one of those artists where she always does well when it comes to album sales, nothing like ariana so I wouldn’t use her as an example since she will always come on top."
2993,2020-11-09 12:59:20,jqrqml,"in all fairness, sales are literally her manager's job. blaming scooter for the music being crap is unfair, blaming scooter for the sales being low is more justified. as a whole though, people do demonise scooter a lot."
2994,2020-11-09 06:06:25,jqrqml,"Yes, it definitely wasn't TUN level. I agree with you.

Hmm, I believe that credit should be given when credit is due. Lover didn't do that well for Taylor's standards even though Taylor went ham with promoting it, but Folklore almost matched Lover in sales even though she barely did promo. Not even Taylor is infallible. If your album is good, it'll do well. That was the case for Folklore.

But Positions fell hard from TUN in terms of sales. If we're comparing Ari with her past works, it's not good either."
2995,2020-11-09 13:01:11,jqrqml,Sales can be low because music is crap though. I don't think Positions is crap (FAR FROM IT) but musical quality plays a massive role in sales.
2996,2020-11-09 06:11:47,jqrqml,"But it’s like why compare her old numbers when u can just enjoy what she got now 😭, of course it’s not gonna do similar numbers if people don’t like it. At the end she’s still number 1 whether the numbers were high or low."
2997,2020-11-09 13:12:19,jqrqml,"oh yeah for sure, but imo sales have a lot more to do with promotion and strategy. a lot of crap albums have sold loads of copies because of a few good singles and strong marketing. i'm just saying this is one area where it's not entirely unreasonable to assign some responsibility to her manager."
2998,2020-11-09 06:15:56,jqrqml,"Hmm, because I am interested in what the GP thinks of her works. As a fan I'm super biased towards her stuff so I always find it great, but I don't want to just stay in my biased bubble. I want to hear perspectives that might clash with my own. It helps me look at her works with new perspectives and thoughts"
2999,2020-11-09 13:34:12,jqrqml,"I think Scooter would have wanted Ari to do more promo, but she probably didn't want to. She's much less invested in charts than he is, or has at least indicated so during interviews. I don't think we should really point fingers at him because an artist as big as Ari probably has her own agency that he can't do much about."
3000,2020-11-10 05:09:16,jqrcr6,I preferred her in Roanoke over Hotel! She was a good addition!
3001,2020-11-10 05:09:32,jqrcr6,"*I preferred her in*

3075,2020-12-15 15:34:28,kdnr08,"Lady Gaga as she is a pop artist. There are a few parallels with Madonna, who in the 80s also ""shocked"" a lot of people with her music and persona. Pop icons tend to ""live"" longer."
3076,2020-12-15 15:34:28,kdnr08,Lady Gaga!!! She has an Oscar and numerous other awards. She’s proving her talent is going to be long lasting
3077,2020-12-15 15:42:46,kdnr08,"Lady Gaga from me. She can do a large crossover of music base which reaches all ages. It isn't about how many #1 songs you've sold. Look back 50 yrs & you still hear music from Barbara Streisand, Frank Sinatra & Michael Jackson for examples."
3078,2020-12-15 15:29:37,kdnr08,Lady Gaga for sure.
3079,2020-12-15 15:37:44,kdnr08,"Lady Gaga. Her outrageous outfits are costumes in many popular shows such as the Office and Community. I'm not into either artist in particular, but I know Pokerface and I kissed a girl and I liked it."
3080,2020-12-15 16:00:03,kdnr08,"I doubt anyone is going to really remember them in 50 years. Media changes too quickly to stand the test of time for 50 years, and neither of them are relevant enough even today to give me any hope that they will."
3081,2020-12-15 15:40:20,kdnr08,I dont recall Drake doing a Superbowl Halftime show so based on that fact alone I'd have to say Lady Gaga.
3082,2020-12-15 16:45:29,kdnr08,"So I'd more likely listen to drake in my free time.
I'm a logic fan and so on. But I think the answer to this is lady gaga...
Edit: I change my mind given that most people then would be more likely drake fans lol..."
3083,2020-12-15 15:31:09,kdnr08,"I havent heard anyone mention Lady Gaga in like 5 years, I totally forgot she existed, I'm leaning toward Drake."
3084,2020-12-15 15:41:27,kdnr08,"Drake and it isn’t close at all. Drake is up there with the Beatles in popularity. He will probably pass them by the time he’s done. 

He’s sold 10x as many albums as lady Gaga. He will be remembered more just for that. 

He’s probably the most iconic rapper ever. He’s more than doubled the next rapper Eminem and Eminem is insanely well known so it shows how popular Drake actually is. 

His music will be listened to 50 years from now 100%. Lady Gaga’s music is super debatable. 

Lady Gaga hasn’t been in any movies that I think will be iconic enough to be popular in 50 years and nobody can name who owned makeup lines 50 years ago without looking it up.

Easily Drake"
3085,2020-12-15 15:35:58,kdnr08,Maybe but Drake is the best selling artist of all time. He has a lot more music awards than she does and a lot more number 1s
3086,2020-12-15 15:49:49,kdnr08,"Drake is more popular than all 3 of them statistically by any metric you want to use. Concert size, albums sold, top 100 songs, top 10 billboards, merchandise sold, etc etc. The list goes on. 

I'm not trying to get i na long argument with people, I just think a lot of people don't understand how huge Drake actually is."
3087,2020-12-15 16:09:01,kdnr08,I believe the latter is a Katy Perry song.
3088,2020-12-15 21:34:30,kdnr08,"Drake is the best selling solo artist of all time. Even more than michael jackson.

Seems pretty relevant"
3089,2020-12-15 15:42:31,kdnr08,"Thats a weirdly specific parameter

Most of Drake's music isnt all ages appropriate. If the NFL could get away with having Drake they would have him."
3090,2020-12-15 19:06:31,kdnr08,Didn’t she win 2 oscars just last year?
3091,2020-12-15 15:38:09,kdnr08,"Very true but she also has a lot of impact with her fan base and being a huge advocate for the LGBTQ+ community. While I’m sure Drake does a lot too, shes more outspoken"
3092,2020-12-15 15:53:33,kdnr08,I won't be here in 50 yrs but for you keep a note on this question. In the note have something for one of you to win like buy dinner. Open with wife in 50 yrs.
3093,2020-12-15 16:27:27,kdnr08,Is it? Okay. We can see how well I know Lady Gaga.
3094,2020-12-15 22:02:49,kdnr08,"Even so, in terms of media, 50 years is a *very* long time. 50 years ago music was very different, almost alien to what it is today. Artists from that long ago aren't relevant anymore, songs from that long ago don't influence media today barring a few exceptions. 

Its not that Drake isn't relevant enough to remain so for 50 years, it's that media itself just doesn't remain relevant for very long."
3095,2020-12-15 15:46:45,kdnr08,"I mean probably, I was just thinking of the NFL's huge  viewership. Personally I dont listen to either of them, but it was my 2 cents worth of food for thought!"

I think people slept on it a bit when it first came out because it was written and recorded in such a short amount of time, came out shortly after Ghosts I-IV and Year Zero, and was free digitally, so people just assumed it was kind of a throwaway album. But it’s really incredible."

3107,2020-12-15 07:23:06,kdgjtf,"I was born in 80 and I love the 80s, but the times I most remember are in the 90s when I started growing up and having older experiences. I absolutely loved my 80s childhood, but my sisters and I were kinda sheltered because we were only allowed to listen to country music and I didn’t discover other genres until the 90s when I was able to make my own decisions. Now, when a song is playing that was big at the time in the 80s and I’ve never heard it, friends think I’m weird. I guess I didn’t have the typical 80s childhood experience is what I’m getting at."
3108,2020-12-16 02:23:44,kdgjtf,"Also born in 1981. Definitely prefer the 90’s, especially 1997 through 1999. For me, it was the years I was old enough to go out on my own and do stuff, but young enough where I didn’t yet have financial responsibilities. Thinking most people relate to the coming of age period of their life with the decade they favor. For me, that’s true.

I do have some fond memories of the 80’s as a little kid though. Like watching Pinwheel on Nickelodeon at my grandmother’s house."
3109,2020-12-18 19:11:06,kdgjtf,"I was born in 84’ I always call myself an 80s baby/kid  and a 90s kid/teen. I do have some memories from 1988 and 1989 usually larger ones like starting kindergarten or forcing my mom to go see The Little Mermaid with me 3 times or my first trip to the Museum of Natural History. I also remember all the cartoons I used to watch as a little kid.  
 
But the 90s I was older so I have more memories. I would say 1989 to maybe 1993 I have the best little kid type memories, but my favorite part of the 90s was 1994 to 1999 because I was a tween and then teen and was very into the movies, music, hot celebrities, teenage shows, cool fashion etc. I think it happens to every kid just depends on when you were born. You get to an age where you are just soaking up the trends and loving it. 
 
But I honestly love 80s music and movies etc. just as much as the 90s. Even though I was little we were still exposed to it and content was released at a much slower rate than today. 
 
I feel like when you are born in the first year or two of a decade you get the best of both worlds so that’s probably what you are experiencing and there is nothing wrong with preferring the 80s."
3110,2020-12-15 16:31:58,kdgjtf,"I was born in 82 and I have extremely fond memories of both decades.  

I think as you said yourself about being an awkward teen and having a rough time in the 90s.  It really depends on the experiences you have in that decade that will form your opinion and feelings of it.

For me, as I mentioned above, I have fond memories of the 80s and 90s, as well as most of the 00's.  However, I haven't really enjoyed my 30's, so the 2010's have been a pretty crappy decade for me personally."
3111,2020-12-15 07:07:55,kdgjtf,"It all depends on which zeitgeist you respond strongest to. I was born in the 80’s, enjoy the 90’s as my first decade of consciousness, but my personality and ideals are more aligned with the 60’s and 70’s."
3112,2021-03-29 00:37:39,kdgjtf,"I mean I think you spelled out why you’re not that attached to the 90s. Rough teen years will do that to a person.

I’m two years older than you. My most consistent memories of the 80s don’t kick in until the mid 80s. When I think of my childhood, I think more late 80s/early 90s, and the rest true teen years (I was born later in the year so I was a 90s teen up until nearly the end of the decade).

So when I think of the 90s, I do think of it as *my* decade. It’s the first full decade I can recall, it literally took me from elementary school to college, it shaped my tastes and outlook more than the 80s could. I’m fond of the 80s, and loved late 80s kid culture immensely, but you can’t really experience any decade remotely to the fullest as a little kid.

I actually find it odd to see so many late 80s and 90s babies, who can’t remember the full decade, seeming exceptionally more attached to the 90s than the 00s. To the point of almost claiming ownership over the decade. Bizarre.

But on the other hand my little brother was born in 84 and I’m shocked at both how much he remembers from the 80s, and how extremely fond he is of the decade."
3113,2020-12-18 19:12:52,kdgjtf,I love Pinwheel!!! I have trouble finding people I know irl who remember it.
3114,2020-12-18 19:29:39,kdgjtf,I think you are right about the coming of age thing. If someone asked me what shows were cool when you were growing up I might say Buffy or Party of Five or Dawson’s Creek. It’s just want comes to mind first my brain just goes to junior high and high school. But there are so many other great shows from when I was younger than that. But unless the question is more specific it’s just natural for me to give the late 90s answers.
3115,2021-04-01 17:22:58,kdgjtf,"Oh that's awesome. Sounds like you and your brother have quite a bit in common with me. Yeah, I have an attachment to the 80s/early 90s and the 2000s in a way that I don't to the majority of the 90s, which is interesting. Probably the exact opposite of most people. I just see it as a time when I struggled to fit in I wasn't like a lot of the popular guys, which didn't help. Being a geek or in any way socially awkward certainly has a hand in that, since it wasn't as accepted back then. I really like that kids/teenagers today can be themselves in terms of gender expression and many other things, but in our day you had to still be like a jock type.

Slower development and taking me longer to achieve certain things can explain why I relate to the 00s as it was like my late adolescence (i didn't have a girlfriend or start driving until my late 20s), but it's interesting how it began in 1985 but only for selected things like music and video games. I didn't know 80s TV shows and movies until the 90s (didn't watch tv until 1991)."

*And Lady Gaga didn't mean to insult SRK at all. She has a really straight forward personality.* You can check it out in any of her interviews. But surely it did create awkwardness in the interview, from both the sides. You are just seeing one side, but when she was putting her feet up on the table and the couch, SRK was getting uncomfortably in the side.

Lady Gaga admires SRK and even put his story in her Instagram story when he came for Global One Concert, and also excitedly shouted his name while announcing the lineup. Previously, she has even called SRK very humble."

3163,2020-12-15 06:36:23,kdddlw,"Ye,is her favorite color"
3164,2020-12-15 12:03:11,kdddlw,Yes! And why does she keep putting “fairy” in her captions?
3165,2020-12-15 12:21:23,kdddlw,It's her target audience
3166,2020-12-15 04:27:23,kdd08b,honestly that season was mainly worth it for Liz Taylor and JPM
3167,2020-12-15 05:55:58,kdd08b,"It’s more character driven instead of plot driven that might be why you’re struggling. And some of the episodes are very long, more than usual episodes."
3168,2020-12-15 02:45:33,kdd08b,I really enjoyed this season. I know it’s not super popular but it’s my favorite. I really like Stephen King and The Shining
3169,2020-12-15 05:57:02,kdd08b,"This season was one I didn't like the first time around, but the second time-admittedly a year or two later, during quarantine!-I found I enjoyed it a lot more. I think going into it knowing how downright bizzare\* some of the plot can be helps.

&#x200B;

\*The whole 'vampires' plot plus a serial killer plus ghosts combined can add up to be a bit much, the first time or two you watch."
3170,2020-12-15 10:11:28,kdd08b,Jessica Lange’s absence is very noticeable. You unfortunately get used to it tho.
3171,2020-12-15 07:38:27,kdd08b,"Nope not alone, I felt the same way watching it. It just doesn't have that spark the first 4 seasons have. It's a hit and miss for me. It's like it dragged on and got confusing at times where the others were easy to watch and enjoyable, this one just dragged on."
3172,2020-12-15 06:19:02,kdd08b,"The first 3 episodes are a bit slow, they’re mainly used for setting the stage for the rest of the season. I would continue watching it! Devils Night is an amazing episode and only gets better from there"
3173,2020-12-15 06:20:42,kdd08b,I had to restart it after I abandoned it for not paying enough attention to it before. I liked it not more than Freak show but still liked it.
3174,2020-12-16 01:08:50,kdd08b,"Hi there. Totally agree with you. I'm currently on season 8 and Hotel, by far, is my least favourite. I enjoyed the ending but I actually thought they just tried to hype up Gaga for the whole season. It didn't work. Storyline bored me except for James."
3175,2020-12-16 02:06:58,kdd08b,"I’m like five episodes in and I totally agree with you. JPM, Liz Taylor, and Angela Bassett’s character is all that’s keeping me in rn. I hate Alex Lowe’s character, the detective himself is boring, and good god there’s way too much bloody sex for me. I just want more kills, but stuff with veins and vampires generally grosses me out"
3176,2020-12-16 03:59:58,kdd08b,I'm 7 episodes in and bored as hell.
3177,2020-12-15 16:53:39,kdd08b,"To give you an idea, it is the only season of AHS that i didn’t watch because i just found it so boring, i stopped after 3 episodes"
3178,2020-12-15 03:59:26,kdd08b,"Ditto, plus Mr. March is probably my favorite character Evan Peters has played. I also thought Lady Gaga was great... honestly just thought the whole cast was a ton of fun in Hotel."
3179,2020-12-15 13:46:00,kdd08b,Okay cool. Because I’m on devils night right now but turned it off.
3180,2020-12-16 01:50:31,kdd08b,Honestly I love Gaga. She’s my favorite but Evan peters character let me down
3181,2020-12-16 02:09:00,kdd08b,Liz Taylor has to be my favorite. But yeah the whole bloody sex is a turnoff for me

3203,2020-12-15 05:03:50,kd9vsn,There was a time when I definitely found conspiracy theories really fun and interesting. I'm okay with he Mandela effect conspiracies and alien conspiracies because they can be fun to read about. However I think there is a line where they can become dangerous and I feel like that line has been crossed with nutjobs like Alex Jones spewing their bullshit to the world. I'm not saying Kat has specifically crossed this line but I am saying to just be careful with what you see or read. Conspiracy theories are why people like Cody and Danielle Murphy think the way the do.

That doesn't mean she doesn't believe it! At one point she called something a conspiracy ""fact"" instead of a ""theory."""

3246,2020-12-14 22:55:13,kd3bf7,"First of all, thank you for your support of bisexuals, it's very needed and very appreciated.

Second, I'm really sorry for your experience, I hope that dude didn't ruin your day or anything.

I think when it comes to human sexuality the key problem is that people don't see the difference between orientation and behaviour.

So you can definitely choose your sexual behaviour, but it doesn't define or change who you are actually attracted to.

I mean, when you (I'm not talking about OP or anyone in particular, just an abstract ""you"") walk down the street and see people, you can't actively choose like ""okay, from now on I choose to be in love with that person"" or ""from now on I choose not to be sexually attracted to that person"", can you?

So if it works with separated individuals, I think it's fair to assume that it works with the gender(s) we are attracted to: we don't get to choose or control those feelings, they just happen.

Now with behaviour it's completely opposite obviously. You can choose not to act on the attraction you have. The same way you can choose to have something with a person you are not attracted to. But it won't change how you feel.

I'm personally convinced that a big amount of ""being gay is a choice"" adapts are in fact bisexuals who just chose not to ACT on their same-sex attraction and chose to only ACT on their opposite-sex feelings.

And they come to the wrong conclusion that gay people are just like them, but CHOSE to be only with the same gender.

The same way it happens with many straight/gay people and their attitude towards bisexuals: they are trying to project their own experiences and feelings on them.

So the key point is that people should learn to be open-minded which means that just because someone else's experience is different from yours, it is not a reason to invalidate it."
3247,2020-12-15 03:51:02,kd3bf7,"Wanna know a secret, just 'tween you and me? I never actually cared. Not personally. Hence, I haven't thought that much about it. I mean, it doesn't really matter, does it? It's valid either way, choice or not. So if someone believes it's a choice, and that belief isn't accompanied with bigotry otherwise, I usually let it be, bemusing though their views might be.  


I think of it kind of like this: Let's say someone says that bisexuality is immoral, a sin, the downfall of society, gross or whatever - and that I should stop choosing it and be straight. Well, if I then start arguing about it *not* being a choice, then I'd kinda be focusing on the wrong part of their bigotry, wouldn't I? 

Don't get me wrong, though - this is just me, and for many of my sisters and brothers this seems to be an important issue, so thanks for stepping up, yeah?"
3248,2020-12-14 20:02:45,kd3bf7,I think with bi it's a choice because you can be happy with either sex or both
3249,2020-12-14 20:41:02,kd3bf7,"Always been bi always felt bi despite everyone and everything around me telling me it's better to be straight , if sexual orientation was a question of choice no one would be anything but straight given the sheer viciousness of heteronormativity in our society , so this dude is full of shit and also go see psychological research on being LGBTQAI and you'll see that most professionals vehemently disagree with that guy..."
3250,2020-12-14 21:21:26,kd3bf7,"I personally have what may be a bit of a controversial opinion, though I know it is a little uneducated, and I would be happy to hear other stances on the matter.

I don't believe Sexuality is something someone is born with and I do believe it can change. I think what you're attracted to is a culmination of how you were raised and what environment you live in. I imagine there are genetic factors that increase your likelihood of being sexually attracted to something specific, but nothing definitive.

Now that doesn't mean it is a choice. I think it's more like psychological conditioning. And I don't think thats a bad thing.

I don't really see sexually attraction as any different from other forms of attraction. What bands we like. What art we like. What kind of comedy we find funny. What we look for in friends. All of these come from how we were raised and what media we were exposed to in formative years and even later in life.

Why should sexuality be any different? If it were based purely on the genetic need to procreate, than I can't see how any orientation other than straight could exist, and if it is not, than I don't understand how it isn't societal and social."
3251,2020-12-14 18:54:49,kd3bf7,ig we think alike with the flares huh
3252,2020-12-14 18:54:30,kd3bf7,I agree! that’s how I feel too
3253,2020-12-14 19:40:57,kd3bf7,Same .... It took me til 19 to ever think about a guy in that way ... Before that all I ever knew was women ... It might be the gay porn I watched that influenced that honestly but who cares we re here now 🤷🏽‍♂️
3254,2020-12-14 23:54:09,kd3bf7,"When people talk about sexuality being fluid and that it can change, it's important to note that it's not fair to everybody (let's not invalidate people are very stable in their sexuality through out their whole life) and that if it changes, it happens by itself, you don't get to control it.

Same with the reasons why people have different sexualities, there is no clear final answer yet. I personally think that it's innate, it just make the most sense to me, because there are people with different sexualities in all cultures, they have various environments and the way they were raised.

Plus there is no clear evidence that there is a particular way to raise a child to be straight, gay or bisexual.

As I said, I think that when it comes to sexuality it stands out because it is observed in various cultures,  including quite homophobic ones where parents litterally make their best to raise a child straight.

I grew up in a homophobic country and my friend, who is gay, said that he had known he liked guys before he even knew that it was possible for a guy to like guys and not girls.

As for genetic need to procreate, I think it's important to note that it's not some sort of intelligent design with particular goals. It's pretty much random. It just happens.

So sexualities other than exclusive heterosexuality can be based on genetics as well."

2. Whether or not it is based on society.   
3. The genetic aspect of things.  
If you think there are more points that need to be addressed I would be happy to hear them. I prefer organized conversation to a chaotic argument.  


Whether or not it is set in stone. The question of whether or not sexuality can change is one that I find very interesting. I think that we can all agree, nobody chooses their sexuality. Whether or not it can change, it is not something people have conscious control over. So the question of whether or not it can change needs to be seen as an overtime thing rather than an individual choice. For example, if someone believed that they were straight their entire life, and then at 45 fell in love with someone of the same gender, does that mean they never were straight, or did their sexuality change? I would argue that, if they never felt those attractions before, their sexuality must have changed. However, I think it is kind of complicated, because our language and terminonolgy around sexuality and gender are still rather primitive which makes it difficult to have a nuanced conversation about it. Anyway, the reason I would argue their sexuality changes is because if it meant they were bi all along, it would mean that there would be no way for homosexuality of heterosexuality to exist. People could think that they were homo or heterosexual, but if a single event at some point in their life meant that they were never homo or heterosexual then every gay or straight person is merely a potential bi person. It is a logical problem. Since the only way to prove that someone is not bi is for them to never have relations or feelings for someone contrary to their sexual identity. The issue there is obvious. There is no way to know something will never happen and therefore the definition of homo and heterosexuality doesn't have much meaning. It essentially means ""Not bi yet... Or possibly not"" However, if you say that sexuality can  change and instead reference sexuality to the attraction someone feels at that point in their life, it gives sexuality a more grounded definition and I believe is more constructive to think about. The one flaw in this that I can see, is it may not line up with the real world. But I personally think that the real world sexualities are WAY more complicated than people really give them credit for and all our language around the topic is merely our best attempt to communicate a complex subject and therefore whatever serves to communicate it most understandably is the best way to interact with the subject matter. In the end, especially on this sub reddit, we see post about people who thought they were straight their entire lives and then had a ""boom"" moment where their whole word view changed. One way to look at it would be saying they are bi all the time, but I think saying their sexual attraction evolved over time is a more useful way to look at it.   


Whether or not it is based on society. This one I'm afraid I don't have much too say about. I may just be plain wrong. However, I believe that it does have to do with the environment you are raised in. I think saying ""If you're raised in a lgbt friendly area you are more likely to be lgbt"" and vice versa is a massive oversimplification. My whole stance here comes more from logic than from actual science so I would be happy to see real evidence that proves me wrong. The way I think about it, sexual attraction is merely a form of attraction. There are many other forms of attraction as well. From an objective perspective, there is very little difference between sexual attraction and other forms of attraction. Nobody states ""You are born liking jazz"" or ""You are born wanting friends who play chess."" Hobbies, friendships, and really every other form of attraction is pretty much unanimously considered to be a factor of how you are raised. If every other form of attraction is, then why would sexuality be different. What is it about who you want to be your romantic or sexual partner that makes it any different from any other form of attraction in your life. I genuinely don't know the answer to this. I don't know if there is a difference. And if there is not a difference, the logical conclusion would be that it too is a factor of how you are raised and your society.  


Finally, genetics. This one, I must admit, I made a major mistake in my first post. I massively oversimplified the issue. I do believe that there are genetic tendencies that lead to how people, interact with the world. I was trying to say that I don't think there is such a thing as a gay gene. However, looking back at my original statement., I'm not even sure if that I what I mean. I completely agree that there are many advantages to relationships other than procreation and completely accept that natural selection would have cause to support those genes. However, I don't think that you can boil sexuality down to ""He's got gay genes."" Because, if that were the case, how would that work. Would any gay person's parents be lying to themself about their own sexuality in order to conceive? Gene's have to come from somewhere and the only place they could come from is assumedly the person's heterosexual parents. I'm not stating that all parents must be heterosexual. I'm merely saying that procreation can ONLY come from heterosexual genetic combinations. A man and woman need to be involved at some point. I think that saying people may have a genetic tendency to lean towards different sexualities, but I don't believe people are born with a specific sexuality that is set in stone and cannot change.  


Obligatory apology. I'm sorry if my post somehow invalidated you. I'm coming at this from a purely intellectual angle in the attempt to broaden my understanding and that of those who interact with me through dialog. I in no way mean to attack any individual's identity or self-expression and I hope you will give me the benefit of the doubt when I say I am trying to speak from a place of goodwill."

**Brain Uses Left Side For Lyrics And Right For Melody** 

*A song fuses words and music. Yet the human brain can instantly separate a song's lyrics from its melody.*

*And now scientists think they know how this happens.*

*A team led by researchers at McGill University* [*reported*](https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aaz3468) *in Science Thursday that song sounds are processed simultaneously by two separate brain areas – one in the left hemisphere and one in the right.*

*""On the left side you can decode the speech content but not the melodic content, and on the right side you can decode the melodic content but not the speech content,"" says* [*Robert Zatorre*](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/robert-zatorre-phd)*, a professor at McGill University's Montreal Neurological Institute.*

My opinion but I personally find lyrics just as important as all of the other things that go into making a song. Unless its like EDM or something. I love Kpop as well but to me that's different because that's not my language so it's not the same. But if it's my language and I can't understand it, I just don't understand why I can't understand the language I've spoken all my life."
3285,2020-12-14 18:49:21,kd2ej4,"I fully disagree with you. Lyrics are as important as the rest of the song. If a song has god-awful lyrics (see Lindemann's Fat) it's unlistenable even if the melody is great, and vise versa."

3381,2020-12-30 07:17:52,kmwll0,"Shanna referred to them as ""monsters"" to be dramatic and give the illusion that her kids wore her out all day.  Shanann always gave props to Thrive for helping her keep up with her ""kiddos"".  However, her ""monster""/""kiddos"" were at school all day being cared for by other adults."
3382,2020-12-30 12:58:51,kmwll0,"By constantly calling them 'monsters' and pretending they were a handful, enabled her to promote Thrive as a 'amaaaazing' way to manage. Silly, delusional, mare."
3383,2020-12-30 06:49:19,kmwll0,"I think SW just didn’t understand children. She was too self-obsessed to be an emotionally available mother because she was somewhat like a child herself. When you have a child your life changes and you’re no longer number one. That never happened with her. 

Going back to her not understanding children - I think she couldn’t handle kids. If she thought her kids were monsters she was seriously delusional. They seemed like normal kids that were curious bundles of energy. She really hindered their growth in more than one way."
3384,2020-12-30 12:51:24,kmwll0,"Definitely won’t downvote you but I don’t think it’s related. SW didn’t seem like the type of woman who would admire a badass, *truly* strong woman like LG - one who worked her ass off to get where she is. 

That’s kinda the *opposite* of SW, who felt entitled to scam everyone for her financial rewards instead of working hard. 

But this is what I love about this sub - we can offer offbeat opinions and ask questions without getting screamed at, called names and booted out. ❤️"
3385,2020-12-30 16:30:39,kmwll0,"I don't think it had to do with Gaga, but was a grab for sympathy. 

I'll admit it, though...  If my daughter (15 months) is going crazy, having a great time in a silly way, I'll catch myself laughing and saying ""Hahah, you monster!"" with a big smile on my face. This subreddit has made me a lot more conscious of it.

I think it's not so much the word ""monster"", with SW, but the tone and frequency we hear it. I don't believe my kids have been hurt by my occasional use of the word. Then again we are a monster-friendly family. It looks like Halloween up in my house."
3386,2020-12-30 07:46:40,kmwll0,SW was too basic to be enthralled with Gaga’s music or fans lol
3387,2020-12-30 15:06:01,kmwll0,I'm a huge gaga fan so I've totally had this thought before! I just don't think shannann uses it in the same endearing way Gaga does.
3388,2020-12-30 06:16:14,kmwll0,"Probably not. Shanann was just mean to them and called them stupid shit like ""monsters"" and ""kiddos"". She used it to illicit sympathy"
3389,2020-12-30 15:01:41,kmwll0,"I know Shannan was a crappy mom and all but I’ve never cared that she called them monsters. I actually think it’s a cute term of endearment. I call my dog a little monster sometimes. 

I guess it would be different with children though. They can learn overtime what it means to be called a monster. But words only take on the meaning we give them and she didn’t really mean it in a cute way I guess."
3390,2020-12-30 16:29:58,kmwll0,Nah. Shanann was just a self centered ahole... ;-)
3391,2020-12-30 14:59:30,kmwll0,It could have initially been inspired by Gaga as a playful nickname but it wasn’t really employed that way in context.
3392,2020-12-30 15:06:33,kmwll0,This is exactly why imo as well
3393,2020-12-30 10:11:22,kmwll0,"It always amazes me how much time she had to go live by herself.  I have a two year old that I stay home with and I hardly get a second to myself, she follows me into the bathroom!!  I love every second of it but we’re rarely apart—I could never manage an online presence and an at home business with even just one toddler—unless I ignored her all day which she makes impossible even if I wanted to!"
3394,2020-12-30 15:03:06,kmwll0,But SW worked 16 hour days. 🤪
3395,2020-12-30 20:44:56,kmwll0,Exactly.
3396,2020-12-30 13:28:21,kmwll0,"Actually, she was. [This blog ](https://truecrimecaseanalysis.home.blog/2019/07/15/inception-to-conclusion-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-watts-family-1-of-2/) shows screenshots of Shanann’s social media and the many posts about her and her music.  Most of them were from before Thrive and motherhood. 

(Apparently, Lady Gaga announced that she suffers from lupus... )"
3397,2020-12-30 06:24:34,kmwll0,"I figured, I just noticed that tonight that LG called her followers ""little monsters "" and thought there was a connection"
3398,2020-12-30 10:44:23,kmwll0,"I suppose Bella had CeCe to play with maybe, and if she hadn't have then she probably would've followed Shan'Ann everywhere."
3399,2020-12-30 13:27:54,kmwll0,"I have a 2-year-old too and i’m also a stay-at-home mom and it’s the same for me.—I don’t have ANY time to myself. But i enjoy being with my sweet baby boy, i love teaching him & watching him learn new stuff all the time and just enjoying him. Shanann wasn’t like you & me. I don’t think she enjoyed being with her kids at all. I wonder if she truly even loved them. (I do believe that she *believed* that she loved them though.)"
3400,2020-12-30 15:40:18,kmwll0,"I think she also has fibromyalgia (wow, I'm sure I butchered that spelling).  She took a year off to deal with it, but seems to be doing much better now."
3401,2020-12-30 08:54:48,kmwll0,"No I gotcha, I didn't think it was a bad question at all and there's no harm in asking :)"
3402,2020-12-30 05:50:41,kmw8p0,I think Lana did a great job of combining the modern world while giving off strong Americana 1950s/60s/70s vibes throughout different albums of her music career. She was urban but also had a flair for vintage through her music and artistry and I found that cool because visually and musically there was no dissonance — for me at least.
3403,2020-12-30 15:16:15,kmw8p0,"That’s kind of the best part. 

She maintains true to her nostalgia vibe but still changes each visually/sonically. 

Sometimes artists don’t change enough, and sometimes they change waay too much. Lana seems to have a real talent for balancing that. She stays true to her vibe but changes enough to have each album be themed and different."
3404,2020-12-30 15:33:49,kmw8p0,"literally she does it soo good. typically i hate it when artists change their sound—because it sucks, most of the time. but lana does it very well and never disappoints.  and she always looks amazing while doing it <3"
3405,2020-12-30 18:45:52,kmw8p0,each era is so inherently different but also a vibe mostly andly of her fans could enjoy. its acrually amazing. another great artist for eras is marina
3406,2020-12-30 16:34:22,kmw8p0,"From what she has said about Chemtrials it's full on folky and western, she better be in a cowboy hat for one of the MV's"
3407,2020-12-30 05:56:40,kmw8p0,"That’s a great point! Do you notice certain Americana times represented in her albums? I feel like Born/paradise are hardcore 1950/60s mainstream references. And UV is like Dylan/Warhol alt 60s. Honeymoon is total 1940s imo. L4L is back to the 50s and 60s with actual references (Stevie nicks, Lennon, Woodstock, etc) and of course NFR is total 70s (and some Venice beach 90s). Omg I’m rambling but I like your thought that she marries all these different time periods across her discography"
3408,2020-12-30 19:30:24,kmw8p0,Yes! I feel like other artists do the same thing over and over (like Ariana) or change so much that some of their music is not even listened too (miley). But Lana is up there with Beyoncé and maybe Taylor (?) idk but I agree with u
3409,2020-12-30 19:30:39,kmw8p0,Honestly so true
3410,2020-12-30 19:31:17,kmw8p0,I’ll have to check out marina more recent stuff.
3411,2020-12-30 19:30:51,kmw8p0,Lol yes. Western lana

3415,2020-12-30 04:04:40,kmuhbi,"I experienced the same. When I was sad, sad music. When I was happy, happy music. In nostalgic moments, when I was dreaming with the past years, Minecraft and Undertale songs (Hopes and Dreams, my favourite) just helped me to relax, or just cry and let those feelings out.

Music is a thing that makes me more alive. I don't even need a biography, my Spotify playlist tells everything about me"

3423,2020-12-30 03:26:05,kmtxe3," I collected all the leaks this year. The idea is that everyone who could not catch these leaks, has access to it now.

I'm posting now, because I don't think there will be any more leaks this year.

Some points:

1 - Jack Ü stems were leaked in March and inside the folders they had instruments wav, we only had the instruments mp3 320, I think few people noticed that.

2 - I put the track ""On Ice"", leaked in 2018, but that this sub got to know that Skrillex worked on it this year, I believe that some people didn’t get it, so I put it in the folder.

3 - In March of this year, Skrillex sets were leaked in 2014 in high quality, the Levels VIP + Cinema that Skrillex played in these sets was a little different from the versions leaked in 2016. Then, they cleaned up the audio and posted the two versions of these tracks. Enjoy! SKRILLEX SETS LEAK: https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/1RaTNlosfOHjVcX_8aC6cGS1n2MP_ehfg

4 - Ego Death and Temptations were leaked at the beginning of the year and are slightly different from the released versions, basically a Pre-release.

I want to thank all the people who leaked these songs, it was a year that everyone was waiting for the release of the album, but that didn't happen, taking these tracks made me a little happier.

Obs: If you want to download all the tracks at once, the last link is a RAR with all the tracks inside."

3461,2020-12-30 00:44:02,kmpn51,Why are people buying cassettes?
3462,2020-12-30 01:38:08,kmpn51,"My boyfriend actually bought me a cassette player last year and I was able to play my old Janet and TLC cassettes from when I was younger....as well as some children's book cassettes where they tell you to turn the page, but I no longer have the books so really they're just useless."
3463,2020-12-30 05:10:44,kmpn51,So when I bought Dua’s cassette (it was in a bundle with a signed post card that I wanted) she included three colours of cassettes. I wonder if that bumped her cassette sales by selling 3 of them each time someone bought it.
3464,2020-12-30 04:00:49,kmpn51,interesting! i knew vinyl has been making a comeback for a while now but i didn’t know cassettes were too
3465,2020-12-30 14:19:06,kmpn51,I'm so happy Blackpink is up there. They're not to popular in the UK (there the most popular Kpop GG but Kpop is not really big here) and seeing them there after only being out for 3 months is amazing.
3466,2020-12-30 05:02:57,kmpn51,Such a weird way to consume media this day and age
3467,2020-12-30 06:11:59,kmpn51,That’s interesting but understandable. I can see the nostalgia factor. I had cassettes as a young kid but as soon as I got a disc man I never looked back. I couldn’t imagine using them now that I stream everything.
3468,2020-12-30 00:20:00,kmpn51,"Haim, Dua Lipa, Kylie and Gaga have all released 4+ versions of cassettes."
3469,2020-12-30 00:17:18,kmpn51,Kylie did that in less than 2 months. Queen behavior.
3470,2020-12-30 00:56:06,kmpn51,Memorabilia? Collectible item? Kinda like how people buy vinyl even though they don't intend to play them. It's just for display
3471,2020-12-30 03:37:56,kmpn51,im not sure though but pure sales too. fans buy physical copies to support the artist and and it contributes to more revenue than streaming does. ive read somewhere that 1 copy of a single is equivalent to 200~1000 streams.
3472,2020-12-30 04:46:46,kmpn51,"I get people buying vinyls but cassettes are poor quality, get jammed easily, wear out after time and are as redundant as VHS"
3473,2020-12-30 07:59:21,kmpn51,I bought a cassette last year of Lana Del Rey’s Norman Fucking Rockwell. The only reason was because if I preordered the album I got access to the presale tour (the one which got cancelled when I was mid flight to amsterdam to go see her lol) and the cassette was the cheapest thing to preorder on her site.
3474,2020-12-30 10:08:51,kmpn51,I bought Chromatica on cassette as I wanted priority access to buy tour tickets. I don't have a cassette player (or CD player for that matter).
3475,2020-12-30 05:06:49,kmpn51,Yungblud did it in even less!
3476,2020-12-30 00:58:13,kmpn51,"That makes sense. I guess I’ve never really thought about cassettes as a collectible item like records, but I guess they can be nostalgic for many people that grew up when they were big"
3477,2020-12-30 22:04:06,kmpn51,I don’t think they’re being bought to be used. I have the chromatica tapes and it’s just a fun novelty to have.
3478,2020-12-30 05:24:27,kmpn51,Three weeks! Wow. I’ll have to give them a listen.

3480,2020-12-29 21:05:43,kmmeh5,First one sounds like a low-volume growl with all kinds of special effects used.  I suggest asking this question on more of a sound engineering forum like Gearslutz or Realgearonline.
3481,2020-12-31 23:42:55,kmmeh5,"Is it kinda like this sound from about 0:22,  0:42 etc?

https://youtu.be/3ZfjWVxBBO4"
3482,2020-12-29 22:47:14,kmmeh5,What about the others? I know they all can't be due to engineering effects.
3483,2021-01-01 03:19:34,kmmeh5,"Yeah, exactly like that. Especially at 0:22. Do you know how I can train my voice to do that?"
3484,2020-12-29 23:33:03,kmmeh5,"Didn't have time to listen to all, perhaps later or tomorrow."
3485,2021-01-01 16:18:04,kmmeh5,"Okay cool.  I learnt it just by imitating MJ, Whitney and Mariah.  I never actually formally learnt how to do it, so I'm not qualified to give advice even though now I realise I make this sound quite a lot!

Technique wise, it is indeed ""growling"" with false cords vibrating as well as the true cords.  If the cookie monster or Marge Simpson tried to sing, they'd probably have this voice.

I'm guessing that the safe way to do it is to experiment and explore what happens when you clear your throat lightly while being mindful.  Make sure you don't over-squeeze your true vocal folds in the process to avoid the risk of damaging them.  If you need to cough afterwards, you might be overdoing it.  If not, phonate on octave slides in 3rd and 4th octave range.  You will be using light ""head voice"" or M2.

Hope this helps.  If not, I'd suggest coaches that specialise in distortion, growl techniques to give you real time guidance."
3486,2021-01-01 18:47:08,kmmeh5,"Thank you, and as promised, your silver for the solid advice."
3487,2020-12-29 17:56:56,kmj679,I feel this way about the sopranos. I’m guessing I’m a bit older than you but it’s a nice time capsule of the very late 90s early 00s a simpler happy time for me. Cheers mate.
3488,2020-12-29 19:22:04,kmj679,I know I’m gonna get shit on for this but I cannot stand this show I don’t understand the hype behind it it’s so hard to watch 😭
3489,2020-12-29 18:09:28,kmj679,It's funny you mention the sopranos since that gets a few mentions too. My parents loved that show (until the very end) and it seems like they just do a good job at showing life during that time
3490,2020-12-29 20:57:57,kmj679,"I get that it isnt for everybody. I enjoy the relatability of the characters and situations. I had a manager who was very much like Michael Scott. First day I met him he made a joke about me being afraid of the dark (I was 17 and that was literally one of my three fears at the time) not knowing i actually was, he broke a window trying to bang on it to scare somebody in the office, almost knocked over the dishwasher and a server when somebody came in the back and said a customer at the register had obviously fake, large implants cause he literally ran to see. At my current job, we have the boozy promiscuous Bachelorette like Meredith, the quiet guy who actually is full of rage like stanley. I think anybody who has had a shit job can find enjoyment in at least one episode. The first like 3 times I tried to watch the show I hated it but I eventually pushed through and found the good stuff (season 1 is trash, fight me IRL.)

Also the cringe is absolutely comical once you embrace it. Scott's tots is a perfect example, people either love it or they are normal and can't watch it again. Dinner Party is also a pretty fantastic trainwreck to watch while high af"

3493,2020-12-29 21:25:14,kmhccy,Curmudgeon.
3494,2020-12-30 01:03:08,kmhccy,You're paying too much attention to the waves on the shore and ignoring the depths of the sea...of metal.
3495,2020-12-29 18:06:38,kmhccy,Is this a copypasta because holy shit
3496,2020-12-30 02:27:20,kmhccy,>I do miss the mystery that metal had before the internet wiped out the underground. It took a lot of effort to simply find new music - you had to get foreign currencies and send it in the mail when you wanted to buy a record from some obscure mail order catalogue written on a typewriter. And you rarely knew anything about the artists unless you found an interview in a fanzine. That was underground.
3497,2020-12-29 18:37:12,kmhccy,This but a less ironically.

3500,2020-12-30 10:43:43,kmhccy,"Metal isn’t that inclusive right? When all my coworkers were raging about stupid people during covid stuff, i sent “world full of idiots” by cattle decapitation. Now everyone left the whatsapp group..."

3502,2021-01-14 17:37:06,kmhccy,"i thought anyone wearing a slayer shirt was a soulless mannequin. Maybe not from pop, but from generations of inbreeding"
3503,2021-01-20 12:40:17,kmhccy,"Idk but how do you know that person is a souless pop mannequin and doesn't geniunely like Slayer? People are multifacited. I love metal and I'll wear my shirts but I also love other stuff and I don't feel the need to present myself as all super dark and brutal in every way, all the time.  
That said, I do agree to a degree, it's disappointing that rock and roll/classic rock has become essentially a brand you can buy at Kmart. I still try to refrain from judging people. For all I know, that person wearing the generic Kmart Pink Floyd - The Wall shirt might have spent weeks smoking dope and taking acid alone in their dorm room at 18, having a mental breakdown, listening to nothing but Pink Floyd and emerging from it kind of changed just like I did...even if they seem like a ""normie"". Because in the end we all end up having to tame ourselves to fit in with society and make money to ya know, survive. It sucks and it's soul crushing but it's kind of just reality. I often get told I'm too nice or naive but I wouldn't like others to make assumptions about me so I try to refrain from making those about others, even if I know it to be sadly likely."
