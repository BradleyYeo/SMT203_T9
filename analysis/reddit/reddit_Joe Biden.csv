0,2020-02-05 17:36:36,ezbb43,"Looking at the results in Iowa and polls pretty much everywhere else, we have an extremely good case for tiered voting. The leaders vary wildly, but Sanders and Warren are the only ones consistently in the top 3. The progressives are, I think, overestimating the force of their movement... but there *is* force, and woe to the Democratic Party if it fights against it rather than partnering."
1,2020-02-05 16:52:06,ezbb43,"Here are my thoughts.

So, it seems like this is the impact of the race heading into New Hampshire: 

1. Mayor Pete had a major victory.

2. Joe Biden is WAY weaker than the establishment realized.

3. While Pete won the expectations battle, Bernie is in the best position to win the war.

4. Weak showings by everyone else, except for Amy.

Thus, the state of the race looks like this:

1. The moderates are fractured with Joe Biden‚Äôs performance. Support will now be split between Biden, Pete, Bloomberg, and Amy, fracturing their electoral votes. Pete is too unpopular with black and brown voters to have a shot at coalescing support around him.

2. Sanders, with his continued rise and Warren‚Äôs decline, is going to coalesce the Progressive and anti establishment wings of the party around himself (mainly from Warren, Yang and Tulsi supporters), as he wins New Hampshire and possibly Nevada.

3. Unless several of the moderates drop out before Super Tuesday, factors 1 and 2 will result in a Bernie nomination, because if he‚Äôs in the lead after Super Tuesday I don‚Äôt see him losing momentum."
2,2020-02-05 15:53:02,ezbb43,"All I can hope is that Warren picks up a significant amount of ""party loyalist"" types from Biden. But I don't know how realistic that is. There would have to be a lot of people who trust neither Sanders nor Buttigieg, and who have lost faith in Biden's ""electability."""
3,2020-02-05 16:09:23,ezbb43,"Still hoping Warren can pull something out.

I really wonder what will happen with Biden in South Carolina and Nevada. Since he doesn't have a huge war chest, does he drop out before Super Tuesday if he doesn't do well in the next few?"
4,2020-02-05 21:32:34,ezbb43,I said before New Hampshire will be a toss up
5,2020-02-05 17:44:16,ezbb43,"I think it's interesting that Warren is in third place in Iowa thus far without taking a single county.   Maybe that has changed, and she was tied for first in two of them, but I think it still speaks to your point."
6,2020-02-05 17:42:37,ezbb43,Last part is spot on - Bringing in new first time Dem voters like Sanders 2020 is doing should be praised not feared. And they say they will stay.  Polls shows 85% will vote for the eventual Dem candidate in the fall (versus only 55% for Yang supporters).
7,2020-02-05 19:13:37,ezbb43,This is about where my thinking is as well.
8,2020-02-05 16:09:47,ezbb43,"Also, Bloomberg."
9,2020-02-05 17:39:45,ezbb43,"Current leaders in California are Sanders, Biden, Warren and in Texas are Biden, Sanders, Warren. Biden's in *at least* through the results of Tuesday, and if things stay relatively similar over the next month, then we have a potential brokered convention with whomever offers the sweetest VP portfolio to Warren becoming the nominee."
10,2020-02-05 17:59:55,ezbb43,85% is pretty low.... Trump is looking at 97-98% levels of support from R primary voters.
11,2020-02-05 16:14:47,ezbb43,Not sure what you mean?
12,2020-02-05 17:47:15,ezbb43,I just wonder if Biden's support drops quickly and he runs out of money.
13,2020-02-05 18:07:31,ezbb43,97-98% of the people bothering to show up for a primary where he is functionally unchallenged? I don't know if that percentage tells us very much.
14,2020-02-05 18:14:10,ezbb43,"True but it was if your first choice was not selected.  Though looking at it again it is more contingent on who is selected as candidate than I thought:

Five-percent (5%) Biden supporters say they will not vote for someone else as the Democratic nominee, while 9% say it would depend on who the nominee is. Among Sanders supporters, 16% will not vote for the nominee if Sanders doesn‚Äôt win, while 30% say it depends on the nominee. No Warren supporters say they will definitely not vote for the nominee if she does not win the nomination, but 10% say it will depend on who the nominee is. Forty-two percent (42%) of Yang supporters say they will not vote for anyone else as the Democratic nominee, while 9% say it depends on the nominee."
15,2020-02-05 16:16:13,ezbb43,"If Biden stumbles, Bloomberg tries to pick up his voters. Seems to already trying it (see increasing ad buys)."
16,2020-02-05 18:19:08,ezbb43,"He got 94% of the R vote in 2016, or some ridiculously high number. He's going to do better this time."
17,2020-02-05 16:19:03,ezbb43,"Eh, Biden stumbled in Iowa, and Bloomberg received no benefit from it in the caucus itself. I don't think that will change going forward."
18,2020-02-05 16:55:09,ezbb43,Was he even in proudest in the caucuses?
19,2020-02-05 17:48:39,ezbb43,no
20,2020-02-05 15:11:04,ezaufz,"*IBEW leadership.

Anyone see any type of poll?"
21,2020-02-05 15:15:57,ezaufz,"Seems as if every person I run into on jobs is a trump fan. I don‚Äôt like trump, but Biden also sucks."
22,2020-02-05 17:06:56,ezaufz,Wow really? Fuck Biden.
23,2020-02-05 15:08:01,ezaufz,"What the actual fuck, Lonnie."
24,2020-02-05 17:44:39,ezaufz,Call the international and voice your conceren with putting our support behind an anti union campaign. He has been againt unions for a long time. He has five union busting law firms donating to his campaign. (202) 833-7000
25,2020-02-05 15:10:37,ezaufz,"Yeah I don't think we should be supporting any politician without our members say. At the very least if they want to choose for us, if they don't like who we as members poll to support then just don't endorse any of them."

28,2020-02-05 20:04:56,ezaufz,Its gets better when you spot ibew shirts at bernie events. I dont know one dem in the locals supporting Biden. Its bernie or trump
29,2020-02-05 21:20:08,ezaufz,Saw this leaving the jobsite today. Fuckin furious to say the least. I'm a third year apprentice considering bringing this up at our next meeting. A couple older brothers told me to just keep my head down but I cannot bring myself to campaign for someone so destructive to unions. We have mandatory volunteering for apprentices. Do you all think it's worth bringing up?

31,2020-02-05 15:48:15,ezaufz,"Wow, what a surprise! No shit that a bunch of boomers would throw their support to another old white dude. You‚Äôd think that a Union, like ours, would get the opinions of the members. Sadly, the watered-down unionism of ours, and most AFL-CIO, isn‚Äôt interested in either the membership or changing anything."
32,2020-02-05 16:34:41,ezaufz,"Letter from the IBEW:

33,2020-02-05 20:29:15,ezaufz,So now we're actively supporting Union Buster's? That explains a lot.
34,2020-02-05 21:45:27,ezaufz,We passed a motion last night at 606s general meeting for our local to endorse Bernie Sanders.
35,2020-02-05 23:34:43,ezaufz,Fuck that
36,2020-02-05 15:46:03,ezaufz,Biden is the same old bullshit. Just goes to prove how corrupour our Union is.
37,2020-02-05 20:27:46,ezaufz,Fucking executives
38,2020-02-06 01:31:45,ezaufz,"Surprised to say the least. 

My next comment might offend some, however that isn‚Äôt the intention. 

While I understand that Sanders is a natural choice to many for his pro-labor and union support throughout the years, is that the sole reason many members are looking to support him? Or do people actually believe in him as a package deal / what he is proposing long term?

Again, not trying to start an argument here, just genuinely curious."
39,2020-02-05 17:28:26,ezaufz,"Has anyone considered staging a coup to force IBEW to be more in line with the IWW( ran by workers instead of traitorous managers)? I‚Äôm not in the IBEW yet, but this is my upcoming career move. 

Cause, if no one has done  this, it may be my secondary goal once in. lol"

42,2020-02-05 17:22:35,ezaufz,I'm asking my tech nerd friends to see if we can whip up an actual poll.  I've also contacted someone in the Sanders campaign for what expertise we can get.
43,2020-02-05 15:26:36,ezaufz,None.
44,2020-02-05 20:33:05,ezaufz,Somebody lined their pockets
45,2020-02-05 23:03:53,ezaufz,IBEW leadership is smarter than the perpetually online chucklefucks who love Bernie
46,2020-02-05 15:30:49,ezaufz,"Biden and Trump suck on entirely different levels, but you‚Äôre right, they still both suck. 

And to choose either is entirely confusing when we have a candidate who is far more viable than Biden, shares more popular support than Biden, has a far better record on labour than Biden, is more electable, energetic, progressive and downright *exciting* than Biden. 

I‚Äôm not American, but I am an IBEW member. As someone watching from a distance, I think the IBEW and America at large can aim higher than either Biden or Trump."
47,2020-02-06 00:42:37,ezaufz,I never met a Biden fan on the Jobsite. It's always Trump or Bernie.
48,2020-02-06 03:17:44,ezaufz,"It's either Trump or Bernie on my sites, and the split is almost exactly at 50 years of age. Anyone younger is a Bernie fan, anyone 50+ is a Trumpie. It's funny how the different values are so clearly generational."
49,2020-02-05 15:09:34,ezaufz,Yep. Endorse a guy that crosses picket lines for photo ops. It‚Äôs a great look. :/
50,2020-02-05 19:11:39,ezaufz,"Thanks for posting the number. I just called, letting them know that they screwed the pooch on this and it felt good. Maybe we can put enough pressure on them to pull the endorsement.  International never seems to care what we think but endorsing anyone but Bernie this time round is just digging the grave for the union movement."
51,2020-02-05 18:01:01,ezaufz,Heres a link to an article about the union busting donations incase anyone is interested https://theintercept.com/2020/01/31/joe-biden-donors-anti-union-lawyers/
52,2020-02-05 23:05:04,ezaufz,Just called and let them know how happy I am they didn't endorse Breadline Bernie!
53,2020-02-06 03:25:23,ezaufz,"You don't want Dear Leader to make decisions for us? Madness!

Seriously though, we vote over changes of a single word on contracts and where our pay goes, why the hell wouldn't a huge thing like presidential candidate endorsement be put to a vote?"
54,2020-02-05 20:25:30,ezaufz,"I'd never support someone who's never been a worker but claims to know what's best for them better than they do.

Bernie will always say he supports you. Even as you lose your house because you can't find work because the economy crashed due to his delusional far left policies."
55,2020-02-05 21:36:44,ezaufz,"Always. That‚Äôs what the ‚ÄúGood of the union‚Äù portion of the meeting is for, or you can move a resolution under new business should you wish. That‚Äôs slightly more drastic and to be avoided unless you‚Äôve seen it done before and are comfortable with the process. 

Don‚Äôt be a clown up there, just state your opinion calmly. Remember, it‚Äôs not likely that your Local Union leadership had much say in this either. It‚Äôs not their fault."
56,2020-02-05 16:44:50,ezaufz,Isnt bernie also an old white dude ? Lol
57,2020-02-06 03:03:01,ezaufz,"To answer your questions, in order:

No: Not only is he pro-labour, he actually stands for something and is so much more consistent in that message over his lifetime than anyone else on the field‚Ä¶ and he can and will beat Trump, unlike Biden, who has difficulty beating his afternoon nap. 

Yes: you and I and all of us in the Labour movement are building a temple a thousand years in the making. It began before you were born and won‚Äôt be finished before you die but we‚Äôre in this because what we are doing is *important* to correct the injustices of the past and bring forth something better for the future of all of us. Bernie is only a brick in the wall. We are *all* bricks in the wall."
58,2020-02-06 06:03:52,ezaufz,"His message has been the same for decades.  He isn't just bandwagoning onto popular issues.  He's been fighting for the working class since he's been in politics.  Before that, he fought for civil rights even though he had nothing to gain.  When there was no political capital to gain from it, he was defending gay people in Congress as well.  

And after all this time, you'd think the DNC could have dredged up some dirt on him if there was any, but he's the real deal.  While conservatives are circling the wagons and looking after their own, he's asking his supporters to ""Fight for someone you don't know.""

To follow in his example would be to take solidarity with people who share common struggles rather than common attributes.

...that, and even the cynics out there have to admit that the study is clear:  Healthcare for everyone under a plan where the state negotiates directly with the care providers and cuts out insurance actually *saves* money compared to our current system.

And we need to save this planet for human occupation if we don't want to be awash in hundreds of millions of displaced climate refugees.  Bad for them, bad for us.

And campaign finance, bloated military spending, industrialized prisons, and the list keeps going on.  He won't be able to singlehandedly fix all of this, but he'll be our ally in this and help us to fix it.

Like........wouldn't it be nice to *actually* be the good guys again?"
59,2020-02-05 18:44:04,ezaufz,"That would be awesome. The local level tends to be that way.I‚Äôve worked with most of the guys who now run my local. But the international for some reason seems out of touch and disinterested in the concerns or opinions of the rank and file members.  What needs to change is direct elections of the international leadership rather then appointing them at a convention. Also our union needs a referendum system so that the locals can force votes and changes on the international.

Anyway welcome to the brotherhood once you make the change and solidarity to the one big union."

64,2020-02-05 23:05:48,ezaufz,"As far as I can tell, either our fellow brothers and sisters support trump, or Bernie for the overwhelming majority of my local (upstate NY). And as far as I'm concerned Bernie is by far the better choice out of everyone. He is, and has been pro labor and pro union.  I dont understand how members of any labour union can support the Republicans, specifically trump.. they and especially trump stand for the opposite of what the union is trying to achieve, and if the decision was trump's, every single local in the Us would be entirely dissolved or severely weakened. It's insane how brain dead some seem to be... why vote for someone who had specifically put many contractors under by refusing to pay for work completed, or outright failing to hold up any part of his end of the contract... just nuts, vote for someone who actually supports IBEW and all blue collar workers having a better future, through pay, protections, and health care (which btw is we had universal health care, we would pay a bit more in taxes, but then have a massive amount of left over funds that could be used towards annuity and take home pay, far offsetting the small tax hike)"
65,2020-02-05 18:21:37,ezaufz,Yeah I agree but either way I don‚Äôt think it makes a difference he‚Äôll probably win again
66,2020-02-06 12:06:25,ezaufz,Yeah that‚Äôs exactly how I see it too. I just keep my mouth shut cuz it seems like I‚Äôm in the minority being a left leaner

72,2020-02-05 23:32:12,ezaufz,"Just heard my local is in talks with trumps campaign because he might promise us funding for a rail line project, so I think I‚Äôm most definitely going to speak up and mention how a green new deal is incredibly electrically focused."

77,2020-02-07 00:35:44,ezaufz,"While I understand that a politician who has a ‚Äòconsistent message‚Äô throughout their career is rare and applaud worthy, on the flip side of that coin, Sanders is a career politician, and for most of his life has collected a pretty substantial salary that you, I, and our neighbors pay for. 

As a fringe democrat, he‚Äôs put his name on few useful pieces of legislation throughout this government work, citing the need for radical change to our system, I.e. more government (less freedom). 

Obviously his big pitch has always been a Medicare for all, single payer system that is undeniably a huge stretch from what we have now (not saying our current healthcare system isn‚Äôt flawed) however, I believe he was once quoted calling for the nationalization of the banking system, the energy industry etc etc. Which is pretty effing scary if you ask me. 

All this being said, I do respect the guy for sticking to his guns all these years, he is a nice relatable person who does mean well (I think) but at the of the day he is just another career politician, but a little more radical and slightly more communist than most of them."

The idea that regulating the excesses of capitalism and ensuring that opportunity to all regardless of the economic strata in which we are born will equal in any way less freedom for the average citizen then you‚Äôve already taken the poison. 

Ever heard of the freedom index? It was invented by an  American think tank to gauge the average ability of global citizens on a variety of things like freedom to speak, have faith, live life, work, defend property, have opportunities and America didn‚Äôt place in the top 10. Canada, a country with tighter regulations on business as well as socialized medicine had you beat at #6. Why? Because less freedom for big business to steamroll over the working class means more freedom for more people."

117,2020-02-05 14:47:54,ezajot,I‚Äôm not sure what you mean but if you could help me understand what‚Äôs OK and not as me being a Christian and I would appreciate it. I don‚Äôt have parents so I have never learned from anybody who can help me understand these kind of things. I‚Äôm surrounded by people who are mixed up in this whole thing and I am also confused
118,2020-02-05 14:48:30,ezajot,I‚Äôm not trolling at all I‚Äôm seriously concerned and I feel like you should be to as a Christian

120,2020-02-05 14:55:23,ezajot,"I think that I‚Äôm doing the right thing by questioning this stuff and it seriously bothers me when I speak to other Christians who try to ignore it like it‚Äôs not real. Where is the line for you?  please tell me

I have lost my faith in this president and now I am concerned"
121,2020-02-05 14:51:54,ezajot,For instance Christianity today made a big thing about him. Is this worth looking into at all?

127,2020-02-05 15:05:19,ezajot,"I know you are not talking about the Clintons, but they had just as many issues, and arguably more, than the current President.

Interestingly enough, when all the dirt came out on President Clinton we were told that the Christian thing to do was to forgive him and understand that we are all sinners and that God shows grace to even the worse among us....

Now what we are told, ""Supporters of Trump aren't really Christians and should burn in hell.""

It's all really silly....."
128,2020-02-05 14:49:57,ezajot,I didn‚Äôt say you were. There are lots of Christians who do not like Donald Trump. obviously there are a lot that do I am caught in the middle
129,2020-02-05 14:50:29,ezajot,I‚Äôve gone through many changes in my life I started out a Christian and then followed some other religions and philosophies but I wound up being a Christian in the end and I am genuinely concerned
130,2020-02-05 15:00:32,ezajot,"All right let‚Äôs be honest here, every comment on Reddit is Clickbait or at least the vast vast majority. Nobody on Reddit post something without wanting other people to click on it. So I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre so upset about but you‚Äôre basically telling me not to try and get people to click on my post. 

That‚Äôs insane on Reddit just to let you know"
131,2020-02-05 14:58:42,ezajot,Well thank the good Lord at least you don‚Äôt support him many Christians do. I am surrounded by people who are telling me it‚Äôs OK for the president to do the things he‚Äôs done because we haven‚Äôt for sure proven it. Anybody else would be considered 100% guilty
132,2020-02-05 15:04:17,ezajot,"Yes but I have faith in other things to and that faith is connected to Christ in many ways. For instance, if I have faith that my father is being honest to me and I find out that my father has been lying to me because it was proven that he actually was not my father.  then my faith would be pretty damaged in Christ as well because my own father who taught me about Christ and faith is now a liar

So political or family or other matters faith and Christ can be connected in many ways"
133,2020-02-05 15:07:31,ezajot,I think Clintons and trump should be forgiven as I feel like everybody should at some point. The difference is we have a president who is on one side with a bunch of people who either know that he‚Äôs lying or don‚Äôt know that he‚Äôs lying but either way they are following him and because of this he is not getting removed from office and he has been accused of far more things that were just as bad or worse than Clintons. There‚Äôs just a lot of chaos happening in the country and I feel like us as people need to do something about it.
134,2020-02-05 14:53:02,ezajot,"If you think that you're ""going to hell"" because of who you support as president, you need to do a lot more reading."
135,2020-02-05 15:02:55,ezajot,"I just don't think it's a good way to get the message across.

Have a good day, brother, and may Bernie or any other Democrat take it all."
136,2020-02-05 15:01:02,ezajot,lol  I'm in a rural county that skews heavy Trump and heavy self righteous.  Welcome to the weirdest mission field on earth.
137,2020-02-05 15:10:29,ezajot,"Did you feel the same way about President Clinton?

If not then this is just a matter of using a convenient tool to bash others who disagree with you.

It is one of the reasons I hate politics."
138,2020-02-05 15:11:05,ezajot,"And yet, we were told to move on from the past mistakes of President Clinton....

Oh please...."
139,2020-02-05 14:53:34,ezajot,What I‚Äôm saying is at what point should I be concerned about going to hell assuming that he‚Äôs done some of these things? With Christianity today coming out and making a stand against him is this worth noticing?
140,2020-02-05 15:01:46,ezajot,Yep
141,2020-02-05 15:11:36,ezajot,I don‚Äôt like Hillary if that‚Äôs what you mean. I hate both of them and honestly I hate the whole political system
142,2020-02-05 14:54:17,ezajot,At literally zero point. Your political affiliations do not send you to heaven or hell.

156,2020-02-05 14:50:15,ezaiwt,"Bernie Sanders should gradually phase out fracking because it is a huge industry and although it contributes to climate change and causes pollution, a sudden ban or decline would mean America would be hooked on foreign sources again and that will make the budget defecit swell even more and pull America back into foreign policy mischief in the Middle East. Instead of banning fracking (natural gas is way better than coal), Bernie should focus on going all out on renewables. That way companies will choose renewables as the price keeps dropping. Renewables are already doing really well in America, believe it or not"

Is not like we are ready in the short term to transition to 100% renewable fuels and charging stations. So if you ban fracking, then you go back to coal. Is coal better than oil/natural gas? Because that is what you get if you ban it. My problem with sanders plan is not how ambitious it is, i actually love that, but how it seems to drop the ball on fracking and nuclear power."

262,2020-02-05 22:16:44,ez90cy,"Portperson during Clinton impeachment:


*Like so many Americans, I am saddened by this difficult chapter in our nation‚Äôs history. Unfortunately, the President‚Äôs actions have forced Congress to take the extraordinary step of considering articles of impeachment. Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution gives the House of Representatives ‚Äúthe sole Power of Impeachment,‚Äù while Article I, Section 3 gives the Senate ‚Äúthe sole Power to try all Impeachments.‚Äù 

The role of the House is to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to charge the President with committing ‚Äúhigh crimes and misdemeanors‚Äù that warrant a trial in the Senate - similar to the actions that a grand jury would take in issuing an indictment in a criminal proceeding. ‚ÄúImpeaching‚Äù the President means the matter is referred to the Senate, which conducts a trial and can convict and remove the President with a two-thirds vote. 

This is one of the most important votes I will take as a Member of Congress. I have felt a responsibility to the people I represent to do my homework carefully before making a final decision. That‚Äôs why I have thoroughly reviewed the facts, the underlying articles of impeachment and the arguments made for and against the President. I have also reviewed the Judiciary Committee‚Äôs report, which was released last night. Finally, of course, I have searched my conscience. 

After careful consideration, I have concluded that President Clinton has committed serious offenses that merit impeachment by the United States House of Representatives. Committing perjury, obstructing justice and abusing the power of the Presidency violate the rule of law that all citizens - even the President - must obey. And, of course, these acts are fundamentally inconsistent with the oath the President ‚Äî as the nation‚Äôs chief law enforcement officer ‚Äî took to ‚Äúfaithfully execute‚Äù the laws of the United States. I am particularly troubled by the clear evidence of lying under oath, in that truth is the bedrock of our judicial system. 

I am also concerned because the President - by the very nature of his office - has a special responsibility to set an example. At a minimum, there cannot be one standard for the President and another for the citizens he serves. This past summer, I called on President Clinton to resign. I did so because I believed it was the right thing to do for the country in order to maintain the honor and dignity of the Office of the Presidency and to spare the country from going through a long, divisive and distracting impeachment process. The President and his advisers have continuously signaled that he has no intention of stepping aside. Thus, we find ourselves at this difficult crossroads. We are a nation of laws and, as a Member of Congress, I have a sworn duty to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law. I must vote to impeach.*"

264,2020-02-05 18:04:12,ez90cy,"God damn, what an Orwellian load of hot garbage.

>The founders intended for impeachment to be extremely rare

1998 Rob Portman completely disagreed. When the investigation into alleged financial crimes found nothing, but uncovered the president did lie about a blowie, that had Portman immediately calling for Clinton's resignation and eagerly impeaching.

>In this case, unlike in other impeachments, no crime was alleged.

The president subverted US foreign policy to coerce an ally into doing a personal favor. Why the fuck would that be specifically written into US criminal code? There's precisely one person who would be in a position to commit that crime.

>rushed process that lacked fundamental fairness.

It was the same process you used for Clinton, you fuckwit.

>The constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley calls it ‚Äúthe shortest proceeding, with the thinnest evidentiary record, and the narrowest grounds ever used to impeach a president.‚Äù

The House heard from five constitutional law experts who said otherwise. You're citing literally the only ""expert"" making this case.

>It was also the only purely partisan impeachment in history.

You know why it was partisan? Because the GOP decided to vote in lockstep regardless of evidence. That's literally the only reason it is a partisan issue. And you're using that craven decision as a defense of itself. Toddlers use better logic than this.

>without due process 

What ""due process"" was lacking? The president, and his lawyers, were invited to participate. They chose not to. So now you're bitching about their lack of participation like it's the House's fault.

>If the Senate were to convict, it would risk making this kind of quick, partisan impeachment in the House a regular occurrence.

You know what this really is? It's not a concern, it's a threat. Trump abused his office, pretty spectacularly. It's about the worst way you could possibly abuse the office. It's not like this was a frivolous impeachment. So when Portman is saying this is now going to happen all the time, what he really means is Republicans are going to start doing this all the time. They already have the market cornered on frivolous impeachments.

Every bit of this is specious double-speak. It's completely dishonest, and assumes we're all just to dumb to see through it. I cannot wait to vote this motherfucker out in 2022, and am going to do my damndest to make sure every Ohioan remembers what a partisan lackey Portman is."
265,2020-02-05 14:39:52,ez90cy,"Why even bother writing this milquetoast op-ed? Portman's voting for acquittal because he was party to the corrupt dealings with Ukraine, and he doesn't want any investigation into his own corrupt actions."

However, I do not believe these actions rise to the level where it would be necessary to remove a President from office.

>The founders intended for impeachment to be extremely rare, and they intended for those seeking to remove the president to meet the burden of proving 'high crimes and misdemeanors' like treason or **bribery**.

I'd love to know exactly what he thinks bribery is if he thinks offering aid contingent on investigating a political opponent isn't bribery..?


Bribery is defined by Black's Law Dictionary as the offering, giving, receiving, or soliciting of any item of value to influence the actions of an official, or other person, in charge of a public or legal duty. With regard to governmental operations, essentially, bribery is ""Corrupt solicitation, acceptance, or transfer of value in exchange for official action."" A bribe is an illegal or unethical gift bestowed to influence the recipient's conduct. It may be money, goods, rights in action, property, preferment, privilege, emolument, objects of value, advantage, or merely a promise to induce or influence the action, vote, or influence of a person in an official or public capacity."

The *only* value of an early Iowa primary is the bounce. Their population is tiny, so the delegate count is nearly inconsequential.

But, it's not the right era for someone as reserved as her. It's an era of bombast and sensationalism. Sadly, she doesn't really have those qualities."

358,2020-02-05 13:42:50,ez8n20,"I actually loved the Democratic field this year (besides Bernie and Bloomberg) so though she's not my #1 choice I'd be happy to explain!

Amy Klobuchar is a Senator who has an impressive record of *actually doing things.* Not talking about doing things, not having great ideas that the evil corporate overlords just ignore, I mean passing legislation.

[Here's here 2018 report card from Govtrack.](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/amy_klobuchar/412242/report-card/2018). No Democrat introduced more bills, no Democrat got bipartisan co-sponsors on more bills, she's got her bills out of committee the 2nd most frequently, she's gotten support in the House for her bills more than the vast majority of senators, and she's created actual laws.

There's also a University of Virginia study that ranks her as the [5th most effective Senator](https://thelawmakers.org/legislative-effectiveness-scores/highlights-from-the-new-115th-congress-legislative-effectiveness-scores) in the entire chamber. They also note that a Senator from the *minority party* making the top 5 in their rankings hasn't been done since 2001-02 as it is of course harder to be effective when you have less power. 

[She's also one of the most popular Senators in her own state.] (https://morningconsult.com/2019/01/10/americas-most-and-least-popular-senators-q4-2018/) (And yes, Bernie is #1 in this category, which is indeed impressive, but you'll also notice Leahy is #2. And thus this says a lot about Vermont as a state as well.) Minnesota is now, unfortunately, a possible swing state and thus her appeal to that Midwest state is seen as a good sign for other Midwest states.

Frankly, I don't understand why she isn't polling better. I think a lot of people on Reddit dislike her because she isn't liberal enough, despite the fact that her platform is actually quite liberal, but just doesn't promise insane things that will never have the votes.

Based on her track record, it's actually believeable that if she says she can do it, she might be able to actually **do** it, and not just talk about it. To me and a lot of others, this is way more important than lofty goals and is the reason we like Klobuchar and can't help but roll our eyes at Bernie every time he mentions his political revolution that doesn't and won't exist."
359,2020-02-05 13:58:30,ez8n20,"She seems pretty reasonable and intelligent to me. She's made some good arguments during the debates, and she comes across as intelligent and passionate. She's not as polished as Warren, but I can see her appeal. She's not in my top 3, however."

362,2020-02-05 13:14:40,ez8n20,"He really isn't.

He ""won"" Iowa because he focused his entire campaign there.  Quite literally it's the only state he bothered with at all.  His national polling is abysmal, as is his polling in nearly every other state.

That said, he's the white Obama like alternative for conservative Democrats who are smart enough to realize that Biden is a bad candidate.

He's a young, white, gay, veteran with a good education and he's decently well spoken.

To be fair to him, if there wasn't a Bernie or Warren in the race, he'd be winning simply based on optics and tokenism."
363,2020-02-05 13:27:33,ez8n20,He's everyone's second pick. The way the Iowa caucuses work is that if your first candidate doesn't get above 15% you has to pick another one. A majority of the supporters of other candidates switched to Pete after the first round.

376,2020-02-05 13:25:58,ez8n20,"To be fair, when you look at the Iowa shit show, it's hard not to get conspiratorial.

Between the lack of timely results, Buttigieg paying the company who made the app that failed, and the eventual release of results that's missing 38% of the vote, the vast majority of which will come from precincts that are very favorable for Sanders.

That's a lot of convenience.  It should be, at the least, a bit suspicious to anyone paying attention.

While I do think a lot of Sanders supporters do cry wolf a bit too often, there are plenty of examples where the wolf is actually there.  

I think you're portrayal of a massive media conspiracy isn't accurate though.  It's simply that the media is run by, funded by, and hosted by establishment insiders.  When you combine that all together, it's not surprising to see an almost innate bias form."

Sucks for them lol because it's true. I'm not going to pretend like Buttigieg is some political darling with anyone other than people who want Joe Biden but think he's too old. 

I was looking at the results of the 2016 primary last night to see how well or poorly Sanders did in southern states. A closer examination shows Sanders really only won states that are very homogeneously white without a diverse (which is to say brown) city center, with the arguable exception of Washington. I can't see how or why Buttigieg would do any better. 

The two of them are going to be fighting over the Utahs and the Kansases, but I'm more interested in what some of the more modern states are going to do... I don't think either will ultimately be very competitive there. Anything less than or up to as diverse as Michigan is as good as it gets."

Do you take issue with Biden's baggage more because of electability or personal reasons?

When you say actually accomplish things, is that a reference to a perceived inability of the progressives to get their agenda passed?

Does she have any particular policies that make her stand out from the pack to you?"
396,2020-02-05 13:41:02,ez8n20,Interesting. Do you know how she feels about voting for the other candidates in the general? Is she Blue No Matter Who?

I think a Sanders candidacy would test her and probably drive her to vote third party, she's so convinced that socialism would hurt the country. She likes Biden's political leanings but doesn't like him personally, which I think is reflected in a lot of Iowa voters as well breaking for Buttigieg and Klobuchar."
433,2020-02-05 14:17:36,ez8n20,"I'd say that's probably pretty far down the list, but is probably a small factor.

For Bernie, I think he's a dangerous populist with a track record of not getting anything done ever. I also hate that despite this, he is currently promising the world based on a ""political revolution"" that has proven time and time again to not be nearly as powerful as he and his supporters think it is.

I dislike Bloomberg for entirely different reasons. People that rich shouldn't exist, the fact that he's buying his way in, he's supported Republican senators *very* recently and Kavanaugh might not even be on the Supreme court if not for him etc.

Luckily, I can't vote because if it comes down to those 2 in the end, it'd be very hard to pick. And would be especially unfortunate IMO considering how many well-qualified candidates this started with."

In truth though, I feel like there is a lot of sexism in why she isn't a big candidate, especially on a male-dominated place like Reddit. It only takes looking at some of the replies to your question. People mentioning ""It's just Biden voters that want a woman!"" and ""Karens seem to like her"" (the whole ongoing Karen joke is funny, but if you look out for it, you'll often find it's just a stand in for good ol fashioned sexist stereotypes). She suffers from what a lot of female candidates who run for President do: ""I'd vote for a woman, just not *that* woman.""

I remember that excuse being used by lots of Bernie supporters in 2016. They'd usually use Warren as an example of a woman they *would* vote for. But now she's a traitorous snake or something and part of the corporate establishment?

I doubt Klobuchar will compete for the nomination for much longer but she could be a great VP pick."

Biden is the most well known and should do at least competitively based just on that. That is not what happened in Iowa at all. 

My theory is that ignorant name recognition might play in the general, but isn't enough to carry someone through the primaries, where voters tend to be more informed. I kind of can't believe that that turned out to be true, because frankly my expectations of people were so low I was expecting at least some of the logic behind why people will vote for Biden to pan out.

The primary system relies on the state‚Äôs election officials to hold an official primary election for registered voters. Caucuses on the other hand are run by civilian volunteers and not the same as a primary at all. I made a simple correction earlier but didn‚Äôt really expect it to turn into this back and forth. These are 2 completely independent ways that states decide to implement to choose their delegates. One is not part of the other. 

People need to understand the difference so we can finally get rid of the horrible caucus process for good. Primaries, ran by their state election officials are so much simpler and run more smoothly than caucuses which are usually a nightmare."

I was really surprised to learn about the shit I linked above, and it just had me thinking, like, okay Amy, buzzing around in the background moving little bits of legislation where she can, moving the needle in this gridlock where moving anything at all is sadly a big deal. 

I recognize we need some big changes fast, and I don‚Äôt think a carbon tax is nearly enough, but would I be mad if a president klob got a carbon tax compared to nothing? No, of course not. What matters is we consistently move the needle because every tiny push will add up in the aggregate, and that aggregate will be a lot better than nothing. I don‚Äôt buy that Sanders could get any of his big ticket items through Congress, but I definitely believe Klob could get a lot of little bits through, and any progress is better than no progress.

(And let me preempt there replies here there is legion of social science research that confirms: people fucking hate women who brag about themselves, and that‚Äôs pretty universal - be it bosses or political candidates, people take a negative view of women when they do)."
480,2020-02-05 17:47:32,ez8n20,"Yeah, I feel like there's always a candidate or a campaign that says they're gonna inspire non-voters to come out for the first time and it so rarely happens. What makes Bernie's rhetoric about it uniquely annoying is that we have proof he can't do it... In 2016. And 2018. And turnout was nothing special in Iowa this year. Obama energized a larger group of voters *way* more than he did.

And many of his supporters have taken on an attitude that says ""We don't *need* Hillary/Warren/Pete voters, we'll just make up for it with young people and usual non-voters!""

He very well might win the nomination. I'm hoping the other candidates take the kid gloves off now that that's a real possibility and vet him like the Republicans are going to."
481,2020-02-05 13:45:57,ez8n20,I'm really doubting Bloomberg moves people in the South. He could definitely suck voters away in the Midwest. I think Biden was hoping to do a hands off approach until after super Tuesday when he has a lead and doesn't need to muddy his hands yet. I think they realize that now. Will go on the offensive to salvage Nevada and win big in SC. We'll see.
482,2020-02-05 13:49:28,ez8n20,Honestly I wish both progressives and Moderates consolidate in 1 candidate each. I have a fear of a brokered/contested convention which will hurt the eventually candidate. No matter who it is. But I really don't any one is dropping out before super Tuesday.

Are you truly, honestly impressed by this? Is this evidence of the mass movement that will change American politics forever?"
487,2020-02-05 14:42:59,ez8n20,Any thread that focuses on Warren is immediately flooded with Sanders supporters trying to make the conversation revolve around him. They're just trying to crowd everyone out with noise.

First, the poll being cancelled because one of his supporters complained (rightfully) that he wasn‚Äôt presented by a pollster. From what I understand, the pollster had text enlarged and it shifted one of the randomly ordered options off of the screen. There‚Äôs no telling how much this has happened or how it skewed the results prior. 

Next, he has financial ties of some sort (whether investment or he was a client on a separate project) to a company called Shadow. This is incompetent on many levels. If you‚Äôre making political apps, the name shadow is just a straight up bad name. If you‚Äôre a political campaign, you have to see that giving money to said political app developer, given the name, as a bad PR play. 

Thirdly, he presented himself as the winner of Iowa hours before the public was privy to information, stating ‚Äúby all indications, we are going on to New Hampshire victorious‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúall indications‚Äù... it was *some* privately available indications.  

Fourthly, the news channels were given 62% of the results for the majority of the news day, which very conveniently had him in the lead by less than 2 percent. This result excluded (and still excludes at 71%) the county containing Des Moines, the most urban county in the state. 

That‚Äôs a lot of things. But I still would bet on incompetence rather than foul play."

The association is that he's both invested in fossil fuels and hosted a fundraiser for Pete. The spurious part is that this association amounts to a quid pro quo between Pete and the fossil fuel industry. So you have to ask yourself, what is more likely? That a long time billionaire supporter of democrats wants to use their connections and their funds to promote a candidate that they think can beat trump, or that they are hosting a posh fundraising dinner party for some back door dealings (a back door dealing that is publicly known, with a reporter present). The total amount of money raised at that dinner relative to Pete's total fundraising is small, so IMO for this to occur you also have to make the leap that additional funds were illegally transferred to Pete's campaign (something I have seen numerous times on this sub).

>[David Victor](https://gps.ucsd.edu/faculty-directory/david-victor.html)

Victor has been a [participant in the Intergovernmental  Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) proceedings since the IPCC's inception](https://www.ucsd.tv/search-details.aspx?showID=30487). This guy is a well respected climate change expert, and he advised Pete's comprehensive and achievable [climate change plan](https://storage.googleapis.com/pfa-webapp/documents/Climate-Plan-White-Paper.pdf). Not everyone with a connection to the oil industry is a fat businessman who lights their $200 cigars with $100 bills. Some of them, like this person, aim to use their expert knowledge to provide solutions to the problems we face.

>Jonathan Cohen

I really don't care who this is. This is an individual donation. His contribution amounts to 0.007% of Pete's total fundraising. This is analagous to Bernie refusing individual contributions from billionaires. It sounds good, but when you consider that Bernie has raised $107 million, if literally every single billionaire in the US gave him a max contribution in 2020 it would amount to 1.6% of his total fundraising. It is a symbolic gesture that feeds into his populist 'class war' messaging but doesn't actually affect his fundraising in a meaningful way. When you see someone say ""Bernie doesn't accept billionaire money!"" What is that *supposed* to mean? I can assure you, the person saying this does not mean, ""Bernie has 1.6% less money than he would if literally every single billionaire in the US gave him a max contribution."""

If In six months people are more resentful of the economic damage of social distancing orders he can play it as liberal hysteria and a government created recession.

I‚Äôve been trying to find words that describe how people I know feel about the quarantine, and you just helped me find them: Hillary Clinton. This whole thing feels like the Clinton campaign all over again.

The willful blindness to the unpleasantness of the candidate compared to the obvious unpleasantness of the alternative, the moral smugness and the finger waging of the media and elites, the complete obliviousness of the social betters telling everyone they have to do it because they just know better.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I voted for Clinton, but she also lost."

694,2020-03-29 05:03:45,fqmnlo,"Yeah if the pandemic slows down or withers away soon, Trump could still absolutely win even with no economic recovery. He can just say that he has tried to stop the hysteria, tried to save the economy etc. 


And if it doesn't go away and the pandemic has not been contained by the time of the election, people would probably vote for him anyways since it's likely people wouldn't want a change of leadership during a crisis. Especially considering how (imo) Biden markets himself as being the back to the normal, passive candidate which doesn't make him especially attractive to vote for when you have a crisis

Looks like a win win for trump. But yeah Trump couldve had an easier time if the virus never happened (though on the flipside,  a lot of the controversies around Trump were buried by the pandemic)"
695,2020-03-29 05:42:43,fqmnlo,"This whole thing feels very 2016 Democratic establishment. This quarantine shit is so fucking me and a shit load of people and $1,200 grand isn‚Äôt going to stop that. But if you talk about how fucked it is, If you complain or question the severity of the approach, then you want people to die. 

I think the media, the liberals, this sub are all doing 2016 ‚ÄúHillary can‚Äôt lose‚Äù again. Everyone of those institutions is calling for deeper distancing and for longer, while everyone knows the people pushing for it won‚Äôt be the ones to feel the bulk of the pain. Its very easy to believe the elites have decided the poor need to stay home and disappear so they don‚Äôt spread their germs to their betters, and this is the kind of resentment Trump feeds on. But we can‚Äôt just tell people they have to like an obviously shit thing because we know better, just like we couldn‚Äôt get people to vote for Hillary by just calling them racists."

I don't understand how you can call people condescending and smug when you're literally like, ""I don't care if your mom dies lol """
699,2020-03-28 17:09:55,fqmnlo,"The plan was to protect and isolate the vulnerable while allowing the rest of the country to run on as much as possible to prevent the NHS getting overwhelmed as soon as they lifted any restrictions, which would have likely to have been close to the winter where the hospitals would already be busy. It was an attempt to lengthen the time in which cases happened to try to keep it more manageable, and this course was based on the scientific advice given to the government. They also said that this might result in a herd immunity effect but that was absolutely never the aim for it."
700,2020-03-28 16:56:54,fqmnlo,"My parents were planning to go to a conference in the UK in the summer. They didn't cancel the conference until a few days ago, long after most *US* states moved to shutter all non-essential work."
701,2020-03-28 19:39:55,fqmnlo,"I watched the fucking briefings they took one tiny bit completely out of context and acted like that was the entire plan. Yes the guy explaining it did not communicate very well, but they never said ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù was the aim."
702,2020-03-29 04:58:11,fqmnlo,"Oil prices will still probably stay fucked for the rest of the year so I don't see Texas recovering faster than CA. But I still agree with you that this will be essy to spin off for Trump, especially considering how... absent Biden seems to be. He gets absolutely no media coverage, to the point when I'm sure some people have probably even forgot about his candidacy."
703,2020-03-29 12:41:55,fqmnlo,"That's entirely fair, but basically every public health professional says the way this gets even worse is if we stop the quarantine too soon, the virus recurs, and we have to do this whole thing a second time just as people are starting to get back to work. Or, the dead pile up in the hundreds of thousands and there's a years-long public fear of gathering in public spaces, which keeps people unemployed for much longer. 

Sure, go ahead and blame this on elites or whatever, but the reason we're here in the first place is Trump slow-walking a response, the reason the rescue package isn't even more generous to small businesses and individuals is because of Republican Senators. We're going to get a little natural experiment anyway with how GOP run states are addressing the virus in a much less draconian way, so I guess we'll see who's feeling better economically come October. 

Also, read the threads about polls here, every day this sub seesaws between ""Trump is doomed"" and ""Trump is invincible"" nobody is treating this like 2016"
704,2020-04-01 13:15:39,fqmnlo,"You just described the strategy people are referring to when they say ""the herd immunity strategy."" 

It's not that crazy of a name, since it was based on the idea that most people would get infected eventually no matter what (whether it be once the restrictions are lifted or just over time at a slower rate under indefinite restrictions) and so the end goal was to get to herd immunity through a controlled but higher rate of infection than the current strategy that most countries are following."
705,2020-04-01 13:16:55,fqmnlo,No because they weren‚Äôt trying to get herd immunity
706,2020-04-01 13:19:54,fqmnlo,"What was the end game then?

Edit: Either you think you can get the infection rate down to zero and you stop community spread or some large fraction of the population eventually gets it. They made public comments that they accepted that the latter would eventually occur."
707,2020-04-01 13:21:11,fqmnlo,To spread the rate of infection to not overload hospitals when they stopped quarantining people. It was never an aim to allow people to get sick.
708,2020-04-01 13:25:52,fqmnlo,"How does letting more people get infected through looser measures cause the hospitals to get less overloaded? 

(Since it's easy to lose tone in text: I'm honestly asking what you mean by this.)"
709,2020-04-01 13:28:37,fqmnlo,"The idea was that if you locked down everything, you‚Äôd still get a large amount of infections about now which overload the hospitals and then once that‚Äôs died down and they loosen the restrictions you get a second massive wave of infections probably around winter time which is awful for hospitals anyway. So if you have soft restrictions in place you get a more even amount of people sick at each time was the theory."
710,2020-04-01 13:33:14,fqmnlo,"But you'll only get less sick people in the second wave if enough people get it in the first wave. The only mechanism for less people to get sick is if they had already gotten sick the first time, which is what herd immunity means. Otherwise, it's just an independent breakout of the epidemic."

720,2020-03-29 18:06:35,fqmiif,"Quite the record indeed. Outside of the pandemic, compare the first four years of Trump‚Äôs time in office compared to Obama, or Clinton, or Reagan? The man knows what‚Äôs good for the American economy."
721,2020-03-29 22:45:23,fqmiif,Lol ...  What economy?  Grifter economy?  Because Trump clearly destroyed the US economy.  Nice job numbers!
722,2020-03-29 23:32:04,fqmiif,"One of the most widely recognized figures in terms of US economic health is the DOW index. Compare 2016 to pre corona virus 2020 numbers. 

Now, compare double that timeframe 2008 to 2016 under the prior administration."
723,2020-03-30 00:42:20,fqmiif,Any way you want to cut up the chart won't cancel Trump sending the economy into Recession after 8 years of growth.  8 years!? Yes.  All the Trillions earned on the market since 2016 are wiped out.  The next President will pick up the pieces of this disaster administration.
724,2020-03-30 03:26:29,fqmiif,"I guess I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised you think a global pandemic is the fault of an elected official. Next thing we know, you‚Äôre going to say the weather is his fault, too!

725,2020-03-30 04:27:33,fqmiif,I hope you can dismiss the dead from Trump's poorly planned response to Covid 19.  Those deaths are not a hoax.
726,2020-03-28 17:39:15,fqmeg2,"Personally I'm not a fan of rolling out an accusation from decades ago that just so happen to come up when politically convenient.

That wasn't the standard for Kavanaugh though, where literally anyone that wanted to put out ridiculous bullshit could just call stuff in and have the media breathlessly report it with zero skepticism, while telling us we have to 'Believe women'.  

If the standard is 'Believe women', then apply it evenly. If we're going to acknowledge that was just partisan bullshit and that we should maybe do some investigation of claims before we give them air time, even for people 'on the other side', then that sounds like a good idea to me."
727,2020-03-28 17:47:03,fqmeg2,"Its impossible to compare to the other two since we have a national crisis going on at the moment

Plus there is no evidence corroborating her story so it would honestly be bad journalism to be reporting on the story until there was"
728,2020-03-28 15:43:52,fqmeg2,Sorry but after all the bullshit artists and disgusting display the media put on for the trump and Kavanaugh accusers I have trouble believing any kind of allegations. So My disinterest won‚Äôt change because it‚Äôs against a democrat this time.
729,2020-03-28 16:21:28,fqmeg2,"It's very clear that Biden is getting a pass because they don't want to damage his campaign. Sure, there are other things going on in the world, but even if there wasn't I could see this getting swept under the rug just like it did last year."
730,2020-03-28 15:45:53,fqmeg2,Aside from having larger news going on at the moment I don‚Äôt think many news outlets are willing to wager their credibility (or any potential legal responsibility) on the word of someone who has written essays about how much she loves Putin.
731,2020-03-29 21:54:31,fqmeg2,"Anyone with half a brain knew that the Kavanaugh hearings were a political circus, and to this day there exists no compelling evidence to support the allegations against him. That is not to say he's innocent beyond reasonable doubt, but that isn't and shouldn't be the standard by which these things are judged, even in the court of public opinion.

It's too early to tell the standard by which to judge Reade's claim against Biden on its own merits, but true or false, it has already served a critical purpose by revealing the hypocrisy of the media and the Democratic establishment, including their allies in the Metoo and Timesup movements. 

The Timesup legal fund actively protected Biden when Tara came to them for help with a nonsensical excuse that would never have been applied to a GOP candidate. CNN and MSNBC have sat on the story and will likely never bring it up in any noteworthy capacity, whereas Kavanaugh's accusers received hours of coverage including primetime interviews, even when some of them (for example, Julie Swetnick) were clearly not credible and even mentally unwell.

Biden deserves a fair shot at defending himself like everyone else, but thanks to mainstream media corruption he hardly even needs to."
732,2020-03-28 16:28:11,fqmeg2,I think Biden is lucky this story is breaking while the entire world is covering the biggest pandemic in a century.
733,2020-03-28 15:50:23,fqmeg2,I suppose they're giving him a pass because he's on their side
734,2020-03-28 17:53:09,fqmeg2,Well her story keeps changing and she doesn't seem credible. So it's a different situation from Trump or Kavanaugh.
735,2020-03-28 20:18:12,fqmeg2,The reason that I feel this is odd is that Fox News hasn‚Äôt covered it. This is a goldmine for them. They should be lining up with pickaxes in hand. Makes me wonder if there‚Äôs an issue with credibility in this case.
736,2020-03-28 20:39:45,fqmeg2,"Is Joe Biden odd...yep, is he a sexual predator....who knows.  Same with Kavanaugh...he's unfit for office due to his behavior during his confirmation hearings, but is he a sexual predator...who knows.  Trump has admitted to it proudly so make of that what you will.

As an older woman, I find the Me Too movement to be dangerous.  Yes, women need to be believed and what they are or are not wearing is irrelevant, but the rush to judgement of the accused is going to end very badly and publicly and when it does there goes any progress."
737,2020-03-28 20:13:14,fqmeg2,"To me, I think part of the problem is that we need to believe accusers while not immediately condemning the accused. I haven't been watching the news because it's been hurting my mental health for obvious reasons so I don't know how they're covering it. I view Biden's accusations like I do Kavenaugh's, if they are true FUCK HIM but we don't know if they're true yet."
738,2020-03-28 22:39:50,fqmeg2,"With Trump and Kavanaugh, there were MULTIPLE accusers and corroborating accounts and character witnesses."
739,2020-03-28 17:24:01,fqmeg2,"He's on the Right Side Of History, so clearly this is all just a Big Misunderstanding and we should take time to look at both sides of the issue, unlike all those other times when a politician was accused and we defaulted to believing the accusations as fact."
740,2020-03-28 20:05:23,fqmeg2,"To be honest, all the coverage of any case of this type makes me not want to even get involved."
741,2020-03-29 05:32:10,fqmeg2,"They will never consciously make Biden look bad, it is further proof of the obvious mainstream media bias in the country"
742,2020-03-28 15:40:05,fqmeg2,"The world is a bit different now, so I've barely heard anything about it. Besides the pandemic, we apparently also decided that sexual assault doesn't disqualify a presidential candidate, because the planet sucks, so it's not as big of news."
743,2020-03-28 15:46:54,fqmeg2,"The fewer that hear about it now, the more there will be hearing it fresh for the general..."
744,2020-03-28 16:02:24,fqmeg2,Mainstream Media is barely touching it at all. We are in the middle of a pandemic and quite frankly things like allegations of sexual misdeed are lower priority so not news worthy at the moment.
745,2020-03-28 16:29:37,fqmeg2,"I think it'd be all over the news right now if COVID weren't such a big deal. The media's lived off sensationalism for so long, they often don't fact check until after they've reported on a story.

However, I also think the media's been a lot more cautious about reporting on stories since the fallout from them jumping the gun on the Covington Kid and given this woman's very sketchy twitter history, I'd say that's probably a smart idea."
746,2020-03-28 18:32:00,fqmeg2,I don't think I've seen any coverage outside of a few articles online. The coronavirus has basically taken over all TV news.

Bullshit

if this were a new trump accusation it'd be front and center everywhere"
749,2020-03-28 17:16:39,fqmeg2,"Yeah, the only reason I generally believe with the Trump accusations is that the number is so high that it seems probable that some, or most, of the allegations are reliable. One person accusing someone of an isolated incident that's more or less impossible to verify, I generally disregard. You need a pattern, with multiple independent accusers, as with, say, Harvey Weinstein."
750,2020-03-28 22:31:23,fqmeg2,Then why isn‚Äôt Fox News jumping on it? They have no vested interest in protecting Biden.
751,2020-03-28 21:26:12,fqmeg2,"So, ‚Äúbelieve women, but only if they‚Äôre accusing a Republican.‚Äù"
752,2020-03-28 16:21:32,fqmeg2,I doubt you'd say that if the accusations were about Trump. Double standard much?
753,2020-03-28 21:06:22,fqmeg2,"Reade's from my county and I read her initial accusation when our local paper [reported it last year.](https://www.theunion.com/news/local-news/nevada-county-woman-says-joe-biden-inappropriately-touched-her-while-working-in-his-u-s-senate-office/)

Her initial accusation was that Biden put one hand on her shoulder and ran the finger on his other hand up and down her neck. Also he had mentioned that she had nice legs. Which, yeah, hella creepy.

Now she is adding that he held her against a wall and fingered her while saying ""I thought you liked me"" then said ""you are nothing to me"" when she rebuked him. Which is a far more serious accusation, far more serious than any other levied against him.

Of course one accusation doesn't make the other false, but it does raise some questions about why she added to her story a year later. Was she trying to protect Biden's reputation the first time around? Did she forget until just now? Or is she (a Sanders supporter who has lavishly praised Putin) trying to undermine Biden's campaign?

Reade has some actual issues with her credibility based on her actions, differing stories, and refutations by others who would have intimate knowledge about critical parts of her story (according to others, she was never fired or forced out in any way, and there was never any complaint made).

This is how it works for every other crime but when a crime has a sexual nature, suddenly either the victim is faking it or the accused person who there is no evidence against did it. We act like it's one way or another with 100% certainty. We can believe the victim because there is no harm in believing her if her story doesn't add up but not act like the accused automatically did it because she could be lying or she could have been mistaken about who did it.

The thing this accusation has that others lack are specific facts refuted by others who would've been in a position to know, and no other people indicating she has *ever* said this at any other point in her life.  Also, the fact that she outright changed her story immediately after Biden won the nomination. And that Joe Biden has been a public figure for a very long time before this, and that Tara Reade is a very avid Bernie supporter. 

With the Kavanaugh accuser, you had (1) corroboration from others that she had said that before (2) a triggering event putting him in the spotlight for the first time (3) a victim whose story did not change at any point. That makes for an accusation that isn't necessarily true, but credible enough to cover. Tara Reade's starts with a deficit of credibility for all the reasons I had stated before, and lacks any corroboration, even a flimsy corroboration. 

I feel like the general public has a really difficult time evaluating credibility of, well, anything, and struggles with identifying why one story might be given more credence over another.  Instead, they believe along partisan lines and believe that any difference in coverage is an example of partisan bias.

Read: photographic evidence. 

Seriously, though. I've had Bernie bros all over me about this accusing me of being pro-rape because I don't like their candidate. Trying to explain to them how news and reporting really works - and that there are times when news has rejected non-credible accusations, specifically in one case from a fringe outlet called Project Veritas that was specifically trying to prove that the media is liberally biased and willing to believe anyone. 

Then they wonder why I get annoyed with Sanders' corporate media schtick and say it's not very much different from Donald Trump's. 

Bernie Sanders supporters do more harm to their candidate than the DNC ever could, and when he loses, they will blame the DNC for it, probably not vote in the general, and we may be stuck with another four years of Donald Trump because they could not get over themselves. 

I'm sorry to rant, but they frustrate me. 

Thank you for explaining this because I will admit to not knowing much about this. I looked yesterday and only say hard left and right wing outlets covering it, nothing mainstream at all, and it made me curious as to why. Especially when I noticed the Fox News radio silence on it. 

There are valid criticisms of modern news outlets. Debates are often poorly fact checked, and shrinking staffs have led to more overworked reporters - the industry, from an inside perspective, is really hard to work in, especially with the low pay. Some outlets have turned to clickbait because it's easy money. 

But as for the coverage itself? I don't think it's a great deal worse than it was back in the 70s, and it's way better than it was back in the 40s and 50s, when the concept of objectivity wasn't an expectation. I think news outlets handled Trump poorly when he first ran, and we still haven't figured out the best way to do it, but Trump is really unlike anything any editorial staff will have ever tried to deal with before for so many reasons. I'm half convinced there is no right answer for how to cover him. 

And all the while, more and more politicians are scapegoating news outlets to escape the consequences of their actions because they've learned it works."

1.  She actually was Biden's staffer, so she engaged with him regularly for that period of time.  She's not a random person who popped up out of nowhere claiming to have had a random encounter.

2.  I think very significantly, both her brother and fellow staffer have corroborated her story and admitted that they both were the ones who discouraged her from going to the police.  If Reade is lying, then both her brother and another former staffer are lying as well, or she made this story up all the way back in 1993 and told her family and friend this tale for no reason.

3.  Reade's story is just the most extreme example of what has already been identified and discussed as Biden's improper behavior toward women and girls.  He was tolerated because of his status, but other men doing the same would never have been allowed to nuzzle, smell, kiss, paw, etc. women and girls the way he had a demonstrated habit of doing."

I get what you're saying, but if she were to accuse trump, I think it would be different because of the history he has with sexual assault.  It would fit a known pattern.

Biden, to my knowledge, doesn't have a similar history.

So I think because Biden doesn't have that history of sexual assault, people aren't immediately jumping on this story like they would with someone like Trump (Cosby/Weinstein/Epstein etc) who did have that ""known"" pattern.

All that said, I think this allegation should be investigated on its own, unaffected by other allegations committed by other people, but we also can't ignore the patterns that usually come with people in power and sexual assault allegations; if they've done it once, they've probably done it more times, in which case, more accounts will come out."

Let's be clear, not only is Trump indifferent to the issues that uniquely impact minorities, but he's had a history of outright racist or at least racist-adjacent actions....from racist housing policies in his NY apartments, to his continued attacks on the Central Park Five even after it was clear they were innocent, to ""good people on both sides"", to ""shithole"" countries....it's incredibly clear that Trump is no champion of minority issues and is either racist or doesn't mind sounding racist.

Let's not even try to compare these two...Biden is head and shoulders above Trump.

Not only has he had the right intentions, but he has often been on the same side as the African-american community, including during the era of segregation and the crime bill (which was at the time supported my many influential african american leaders and did alot of good, including implementing the Violence Against Women Act).  Unlike Trump...he listens, he tries and he is working to help.

On top of that he is being sued by his former colleagues.   Trump might control the investigation department part...via AG Barr.  But I highly doubt Trump controls the FBI, nor made the guys business partners sue him.    There are all kinds of problems with that business that is ""spilling out to the public"" now.  So...it is simply facts.  Reporting facts ..does not make someone a Russian troll.  Like what.  You are using ""alternative facts"" on that one.  James Bidens business was raided by the FBI.  No one here raided James bidens business, published this article, or made him take out a 500k loan.   It is unfortunately facts...the fact that Trump will use it against Biden, is relevant to the race, if Biden is the nominee.  It is not some orchestrated conspiracy ..by Bernie Sanders supporters.  It is published in Politico.  Is Politico run by russian bots ?  That is funny.   James Biden has a serious problem, and it could relate to Joe Biden, and will be used against him in any campsign vs Trump most likely.   (If he induced loans on a lie...such as that he did not really have a ""Saudi Arabia"" financial partner, then that would be inducement...based on deception, and therefore possibly fraud.  It could also relate back to Joe if he induced loans about things Joe would do,/not do or if Joe himself knew.). I went to law school...although I am not a federal prosecutor.  This is bad for James Biden, and putting your head in the sand, and thinking there is some kind of conspiracy between Politico + Bernie Sanders...is an emotional response.

That is why he wanted to create another one...for Biden.  Just because the Biden-favored MSM has refused to do much on the burisma thing, does not mean that Trump will not make it into a scandal regardless.  He will be talking about it non-stop. and when he talks about it, the media is then forced to cover it.  (which they don't want to do.) 

Dont you think its odd...that a 45 year old guy with no special skills..is making 450k per year on the board of a ukranian oil company ?    It is very strange.  It may not be illegal.  But Trump will harp on it either way, which...is one of his best strengths.  and if biden also has a brother under FBI investigation doing anything shady...you know Trump will be hitting him on that as well, and then calling the entire biden family untrustworhty as a result.  His supporters will eat that up...and he will likely get most of the same voters.  Therefore..unless Biden can draw some of us Bernie supporters to counter that (thus far not looking likely unless he adopts major portions of Bernie's plans.)...then that is a loss.  

You seem to be really influenced by the MSM.....Donald Trump plays them like a drum...he will defeat Biden pretty good chance unfortunately..and this stuff is going to talked about ad-nauseum by Trump, so..it is very relevant.

That also would have nothing to do with the other members of the company suing James Biden.  The entire company seems to have massive problems, that is ""spilling out into the public""..which goes beyond some kind of Trump-orchestrated witch hunt. This is unfortunately...a complex web of lawsuits and possible illegal activity, and fraud.  

It has nothing to do with the Burisma ""investigation"".  (that was Hunter Biden.)   James BIden has his own separate problems apparently.  and this is a very real issue, not a made-up one."
1008,2020-03-29 00:45:04,fqjoan,Isn't this about his brother and not his son? Do we have absolute proof that Hunter Biden is definitely not corrupt? Is Politico an illegitimate source? I'm just saying we have to keep an open mind.

[After graduating from law school, Biden took a position at MBNA America, a major bank holding company which was also a major contributor to his father's political campaigns.[14] By 1998, he had risen to the rank of executive vice president.[14][19] From 1998 to 2001, he served in the United States Department of Commerce, focusing on ecommerce policy.[20] Biden became a lobbyist in 2001, co-founding the firm of Oldaker, Biden & Belair.[21] According to Adam Entous of The New Yorker, Biden and his father established a relationship in which ""Biden wouldn't ask Hunter about his lobbying clients, and Hunter wouldn't tell his father about them.""[14] In 2006, Biden and his uncle, James Biden, attempted to buy Paradigm, a hedge-fund group, but the deal fell apart before completion.[14] That same year he was appointed by President George W. Bush to a five year term on the board of directors of Amtrak.[22] He was a board member from July 2006 until he resigned in February 2009,[23] and the board's vice chairman from July 2006 to January 2009,[24] leaving both roles shortly after his father became vice president. He had realized during his father's vice presidential campaign that it was time for his lobbying activities to end.[14]  Later career, 2009‚Äìpresent In 2009, Biden, along with Devon Archer and John Kerry's stepson Christopher Heinz, founded the investment firm Rosemont Seneca.[21]  He also joined the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP,[14] and founded Eudora Global, a venture capital firm.[18]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden)"

1018,2020-03-28 18:36:52,fqjoan,What does that have to do with Joe Biden? And furthermore what does any of this have to do with beating Trump and how does it help in doing that? This should be taken down. It plays into Trump's hand.
1019,2020-03-29 04:44:25,fqjoan,"For one, both his brother and son were mentioned. That makes the credibility lower. Plus, individuals are not responsible for their siblings.

And yes it was proved conclusively that Hunter Biden was 100% okay connected to Burisma."
1020,2020-03-28 15:11:18,fqjoan,"It says he was raided by the FBI, that is not an opinion.  (nor does it say opinion piece, it is under ""2020 elections"" and is investigative journalism, it does not appear to be an opinion piece.)   If Bernie had a brother, who had been raided by the FBI....it would probably be talked about by every political sub on reddit.  People on reddit make fun of Trumps kids all the time....you can't say what the family of a candidate does is not relevant, that would be hypocritical.  I do not make fun of Trumps kids and I am not making fun of Biden's brother.  This is simply a Politico article with relevant info to the race.   If you read posts making fun of Trumps kids...and do not act with this same level of...apparent upset... then that is hypocrisy. 

Regardless, it is all relevant.  and an FBI raid...is quite serious.  If Trumps kids were raided by the FBI...I doubt...you would have any kind of perceived issue with that  being talked about.  (that would also be very relevant.)  Therefore...your stance is somewhat odd."

Understand that to everyone else, you Russiagate-esque leftists look just as bad as the QAnon conservatives."
1022,2020-03-28 17:05:14,fqjoan,"It‚Äôs not just that. That‚Äôs a very understandable position toke but to suggest Biden is *just as bad* as Trump is laughable. Trump is a white supremacist apologist that breaks laws practically on a daily basis. Biden is far from ideal, but to throw away one of the only political weapons we have because we refuse to begrudgingly vote for the better choice only helps Trump. Another four years of him and we won‚Äôt ever *get* the chance to enact a progressive agenda in this country anymore.

This shouldn‚Äôt be such a polarizing though process but even when you tell people here that Bernie intends to do the same, it‚Äôs suddenly not about Bernie anymore, or whatever other convenient excuse, and you are immediately labeled a Biden plant or shill. It‚Äôs ridiculous. This sub has definitely changed."

Also, [25 women ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/women-accused-trump-sexual-misconduct-list-2017-12%3Famp) have accused Trump of rape. So if accusations are enough for you, then you might end up with a rapist president either way."

1026,2020-03-28 21:14:22,fqjoan,"Apparently he used his connections to Joe, to potentially secure influence and potentially loans.   Namely taking out a 500k personal loan...from some of the money...and claiming he would get some millions of dollars from ""Saudi Arabia"" due to his connections to Joe.  It might be illegal to induce a financial benefit ..if he did not actually have a ""Saudi investor"" or whatever.  That would be gaining economic advantage...via deception, which may be fraud.  (I went to law school...but am not a federal prosecutor.).  So ..he may have committed fraud, and it may relate to Joe himself.  It's not good.  And putting your head in the sand from reality...does not help Joe beat Trump either.  Better Bernie (or we) get Biden to have a proper response to this now...in the primary...than getting crushed by Trump on it.  It makes no sense to run a flawed candidate...against a guy who excels at exploiting such things.  This is not going away, Trump will be bringing it up as nauseum, esp if the guy is found guilty, put on trial, or found to be known or related to Joe in any way.  All very, very, relevant."

Joe Bidens brother is involved in a company that was raided by the FBI, he hasn't paid back a 500k loan he took out of that company, and it is being investigated by the department of Justice.  Simply facts.  Has nothing to do with Trump or his supporters sadly.  (When people find something out they don't want to hear...they often react emotionally...and often...""attack the messenger""...). No one here raided James bidens office, nor published this article, nor made the justice department investigate his company.  Your response to factual information ...is not rational. (But rather emotional ...)"
1029,2020-03-28 22:25:12,fqjoan,"Either way helps trump. This isn't a right vs left thing anymore. It's a right vs moderate right leaning thing. The fact democrats are willingly ignoring that Biden shares a lot of traits they get on to Trump about shows neither side are particularly special or better than the other. You just happen to agree with one side more. But why assume the democrats will always share your same morals?

Biden did some awful things and has made and will make choices that affect a lot of people. The fact democrats are rallying behind a person like that shows me that no matter what the country is heading right and there's nothing that can stop it. The other supposedly check to the right is now also right. It's going to become a battle of two assholes constantly trying to appeal to the same base of easily manipulated people. 

A vote for Biden now is telling the democrats hey we know you're against everything we stand for but you're entitled to our vote if you play your cards right. 

This isn't to defend some people's behavior because obviously not being 100% against Biden doesn't make you a Biden shill. But I can see where people are coming from when saying there isn't a difference between them. Biden hasn't ever proven he is different. He's only proven he's another corporate bug who uses political power to benefit the rich and corporations. Why should we believe Biden won't break laws? Why should we believe Biden won't show a racist side? Why should we believe Biden won't shut down any future possibilities of a progressive candidate? Because he says he's a Democrat? As shown with Bloomberg anyone can claim that and deliberately not mean it.

You know trump is terrible because we've had four years of him. You know you don't want that again. You don't know if the next guy isn't going to just be the same thing or some variation of it, and we get the same outcome. 

I refuse to become a ""well least *my* team won"" type of voter while looking at the collapse of any type of checks and balances."
1030,2020-03-28 17:19:27,fqjoan,"I don't entirely disagree, but it comes back to the root point of my own morals. If he's proven guilty of rape, he's not getting my vote. I refuse to pledge allegiance to that. That may be a personal flaw depending on perspective, and I don't mean to damn you or anyone else who says it is. I want Bernie to be the president, and I would very much like the accusations to be untrue, but I'm waiting to pass judgement until we get a verdict one way or the other."
1031,2020-03-28 17:20:10,fqjoan,"I'm not saying he's convicted either, I'm patiently awaiting the results -- but I won't be voting for either Trump or Biden if he's proven guilty."

We should always want the best choice (Bernie in this case) and, failing that, the next best. We need to protect our chances of a progressive agenda as much as possible and letting Trump win is the exact opposite of doing that. It‚Äôs missing the forest because we are obsessed over having to pick from one of two shitty trees, despite the fact that the current one is actually a raging fire."
1035,2020-03-28 16:21:53,fqjoan,"That's your choice, man. You just met me, you're insulting me for being honest about how I feel, now you're refusing to talk to me. That makes me think *there is no point.*"
1036,2020-03-28 17:46:07,fqjoan,I very much agree with this positive line of thinking. It's a breath of fresh air and a consideration I will make if the time comes to vote between Biden and Trump. Call it a long shot -- it is -- but I am still holding out hope Bernie is the one who goes head to head with him and I don't have to settle.

1069,2020-04-21 17:39:54,g5hrmy,"There's also the concept of ""the lesser of two evils,"" which is where you have to decide on the least bad of two undesirable options. That works in example 2, but not really in example 1."
1070,2020-04-21 16:40:58,g5hrmy,"I don't think there is a perfect equivalent. To suggest you're ""between a rock and a hard place"" implies a degree of jeopardy and decision that may not be present in your German idiom (less dramatically you might be ""in a pickle"" or, more colloquially say ""its a pickle."") It is possible to say two options/entities at odds with each other represent ""the worst of both worlds,"" which has an air of defeat similar to your phrase (the tone is usually serious.) Depending on the application, it may be suitable to say two bad options offer ""a difference without a distinction"" if you only mean the outcome would be the same regardless of choice. Broadly speaking, these are just more refined idioms for describing a dilemma -- it would likely be most natural to translate in those terms."
1071,2020-04-21 17:13:28,g5hrmy,"Again not a complete comparison, but a Morton's fork is where multiple undesirable options lead you to the same undesirable outcome. So in example 2 it's be like, "" Trump or Boden, what a Morton's fork!""

Next best one would probably be ""between the devil and the deep blue sea""."

**Why it matters:** The letter comes as Biden is seeking to consolidate support among progressives who prefer Sen. Bernie Sanders' more aggressive climate platform.

**What they're saying:** ""We are confident that, unlike President Trump, Joe Biden will respect, collaborate with, and listen to leaders in the scientific community and public health experts to confront the existential climate crisis and other environmental threats,"" the letter states.

* ""Biden‚Äôs plan to address climate change leads with science and facts and pledges U.S. leadership on climate action,"" it states.

1081,2020-04-21 22:57:54,g5hi4c,At least more people actively *distrust* Trump than Biden (on this particular topic). There seem to be a lot of people who don't know how they feel about Biden in this poll.
1082,2020-04-22 01:35:56,g5hi4c,"He's already failed to provide any example or leadership during this crisis. Why can't he speak out against the Orange Sociopath? Can't even muster up guts to do that. They are all teamed up behind the scenes. Biden running to lose......

[yeah I feel under pressure to vote Biden because Trump is so awful, but we all got screwed over]"
1083,2020-04-22 13:13:17,g5hi4c,Oh boy another race to the bottom election. Nothing says popular rule more than a government no one even wants to participate in
1084,2020-04-22 11:18:58,g5hi4c,The numbers are low for both trust and distrust. Meaning that people don't really care about what Biden has to say at all.
1085,2020-04-22 04:53:16,g5hi4c,"Mission Accomplished, DNC."
1086,2020-04-22 11:22:13,g5hi4c,"Well no shit people trust Biden in this less, he's only a fucking presidential candidate...not the president. It takes a certain type of clown to see that list and automatically jump to ""but look at where Biden is!"".

Of course the CDC is at the top, as it is supposed to be where the president is getting his information from. Of course the governor is next, they're who the president is deferring everything to. As we go down we're getting into the white houses' expert and then the leading governor who is actually trying to do something. Followed by the president (who is the only one who SHOULDN'T be as low on this list, but is because he's an idiot. Then yes, we get Biden, who people should only be listening to in order to get his platform for what he'd for NEXT YEAR about Corona. 

Man people are dumb."
1087,2020-04-21 18:48:09,g5hi4c,"This is silly. 

52% of those polled DON'T TRUST Donald Trump versus 29% not trusting Biden.  


They don't trust Trump more. Literally. It's right there in the photo."
1088,2020-04-21 16:28:53,g5hi4c,"play shit games, win shit prizes"
1089,2020-04-21 17:55:42,g5hi4c,"Because the Democrats sabotaged their campaign to stop Bernie. Biden has no real interest in winning, plus his dementia places him unfit for office.

So by default unless Bernie wins enough nominations, the presidential elections are over."
1090,2020-04-22 19:26:52,g5hi4c,the democrats have snatched defeat out of the jaws of victory yet again
1091,2020-04-22 01:58:13,g5hi4c,I don't think anyone... On either side really thinks about Biden at all.

1093,2020-04-21 18:49:57,g5hi4c,10 % more trust Trump than Biden. It's in the picture on the left side. But also more people don't trust Trump than those who don't trust Biden.
1094,2020-04-22 12:31:56,g5hi4c,"They're missing a category of ""unsure"" which makes the data tough to read and compare. Trumps numbers almost hit 90% of pollers while Biden struggles to clear 50%.  I wonder how Biden would fair if those who voted ""unsure"" were forced to make a decision on him.  That's information I think I'd be interested in, this chart doesnt allude a partisan way, at most it shows that the CDC was the widest selected trustworthy source."
1095,2020-04-21 18:39:14,g5hi4c,"The only thing that could save Biden is if he picks Bernie or even Warreb as his VP, but I wouldn't count on that"
1096,2020-04-22 03:42:57,g5hi4c,"They were so fucking worried about stopping Bernie, plotting and colluding against him, that they completely forgot that they still have to win in November.

Textbook example of cutting off your nose to spite your face.  Congratulation DNC, you successfully stopped Bernie.  Now prepare to get steamrolled in the general."
1097,2020-04-22 02:03:14,g5hi4c,I *have* been trying to avoid doing so...
1098,2020-04-21 20:35:43,g5hi4c,"Right. Trump has access to some of the best Intel the world has to offer with the CDC and Biden is quarantined in his basement. 

Even if asked, Biden can't offer any better information than the average US citizen."
1099,2020-04-21 20:17:09,g5hi4c,"Watch, he picks Lisa Murkowski or something."
1100,2020-04-22 01:38:21,g5hi4c,"The only way Biden could get my vote, is if he picks Warren or someone decent for VP, and I would vote gambling on the old fart dying before the 4 years are up, hoping the VP could move to center stage. That would be a compromise voted. Of course judging by the past, he will put in another blue dog Democrat [actual Republican] VP. If he refuses to put a decent VP in, forget it, we are wasting our time. I would even vote for him to put Whitmer in, Warren, Castro, etc."
1101,2020-04-22 03:44:32,g5hi4c,The DNC does not care anymore. They've already starting the scrapegoating of their loss. They know exactly what they're doing.
1102,2020-04-21 20:45:33,g5hi4c,"Dude I'm literally just stating that you have a problem when more people trust someone who never speaks a sentence without at least one lie. Stop bootlicking Biden so much that you feel the urge to misinterpret facts and defend him to the bone whenever someone brings up the slightest of criticism. Stop bootlicking or you will choke on the boot.

Edit: but then again a liberal coming to a leftist sub. Not surprising that you defend a ra_ist."
1103,2020-04-21 23:09:38,g5hi4c,Is that a person a republican and a woman? Because if so she has got a great chance.
1104,2020-04-22 19:27:27,g5hi4c,they're closer to the radical right than the moderate left
1105,2020-04-21 22:23:23,g5hi4c,"I'm willing to bet we have more in common than this little exchange showcases. 

Despite disagreeing on what a silly cable news poll says on how people feel versus which person is literally more honest (which can be measured and proven), I hope you know that I--the internet stranger--am less of an adversary and more of an advocate. I'm in your corner.

Let's disagree on the small stuff, but remember that we're on the same team. I hope you and yours are safe and sound. Cheers."
1106,2020-04-22 00:48:47,g5hi4c,The only way he could make himself less electable would be to pick a GOP VP. Watch him do it.

1123,2020-04-21 15:16:34,g5gwik,"I dont agree with every single thing in this long article but it is pretty comprehensive, and not agreeing with everything is the point. Some good stuff about how people vote, too.

> First of all, no one should be shamed for letting their conscience dictate their vote or decision not to vote. (Full disclosure: I always vote.) Our system is dominated by corporate influence, big money, and the skewed rules of a default duopoly, and it actively fights to prevent third parties from receiving federal matching funds, joining debates, or gaining ballot access. There is no mandatory voting in the U.S., roughly 40 percent of Americans do not belong to either major political party, and people have a right to register their dissatisfaction with the entire system by not voting. In an atmosphere where tens of millions of U.S. citizens choose not to vote, shaming the minuscule number of people who vote for the Green Party is a disgrace. There are hundreds of thousands of voters whose principled belief is that breaking the two-party stranglehold on U.S. democracy is the only path to meaningful systemic change. Votes for Jill Stein or Howie Hawkins are not being taken away from corporate Democrats. Those votes belong to the people who cast them and they have a right to vote however they choose, and the candidates they support have a right to run for office.

> It is also an understandable and morally principled decision to say, ‚ÄúI believe Tara Reade was sexually assaulted by Joe Biden, and I will not vote for a rapist.‚Äù It is an understandable and morally principled position to say, ‚ÄúI will not vote for anyone who supported the war against Iraq.‚Äù None of these people‚Äôs votes belong to Biden or Hillary Clinton or the Democratic Party or Twitter mobs ‚Äî and they are not votes for Trump.

> Ultimately, however, given the abomination of our two-party system, progressive voters are forced to make not just a moral but a strategic choice with their votes. Recognizing that Biden is a terrible candidate and being honest about that but voting for him in an effort to prevent Trump from further consolidating his agenda is a strategically sound position. This is ultimately what the majority of Sanders supporters will do, just as they did in 2016. It certainly has a better chance of improving the country and the world than enthusiastically pledging to vote for Biden while closing your ears to everything that is wrong about him and his record. Voters in swing states, where voting for a candidate other than Biden or not voting at all may help tip the balance to Trump, face a more consequential moral and strategic choice than people in New York or California. In 2004, the Green Party candidate told his supporters to vote their conscience in swing states, including if they believed they needed to hold their nose and vote for John Kerry to defeat Bush."
1124,2020-04-21 19:48:33,g5gwik,"If you have decided you are gonna vote, the strategic voting would be to hold your nose and vote trump, simply because Biden is going to die soon voting for him equals voting for the vice president he picks, which will be probably Warren. Another reason is that even if he doesn't die, he is absolutely not in the position to call shit - even if POTUS'es call shit anyway. Third is, him and trump are not really that much different."
1125,2020-04-21 17:13:56,g5gwik,"It's more strategic at this point to vote Trump. They killed Bernie, punish them for it. Show that their actions have consequences. If you're still going to pull the lever for a Democrat after everything they've done, you're a cuck."

1134,2020-04-21 15:33:57,g5gwik,"> hurrdurr voting for Biden will save us from incompetent authoritarian Trump

that's just one possibility provided by the article, but there is more in there:

> Mainstream Democrats tell [leftist voters] they want much of that too and electing Biden is a strategic step in that direction or that President Biden will be more susceptible to progressive pressure. They reject that. They don‚Äôt believe that forcing a choice between two bad candidates is right, even if one is admittedly worse. Electing Biden might solve some problems, but it also could result in a strengthening of the far right in the U.S. and could produce a worse threat than Trump in 2024. A Biden administration, they believe, will undoubtedly be a massive corporate-friendly juggernaut that wages military and economic wars and, for them, voting in the affirmative for that is a bridge too far. And many of these people hold the Democratic Party responsible for Trump because of the terrible campaign it ran in 2016, so trying to convince them to buy into the same strategy twice is a losing battle. They are tired of being Democrats‚Äô cheap dates ‚Äî treated with contempt, offered few and paltry concessions, and expected to go along. As a strategic matter, at this juncture, they regard supporting Biden as tantamount to telling Democrats to continue to take them for granted.

one of several examples"
1135,2020-05-24 00:28:15,g5gwik,"It mentions activism can affect Biden, though. But yeah, maybe could have more emphasis on other things than voting and other elected positions.

Also, either Trump or Biden(though some little chance the latter is replaced) is going to be elected. Trump might well turn the US into an authoritarian state full  stop, to alternative almost certainly not. (but.. might keep the situation in the US in a place a repeat of this shit is possible) Edit: infact given that, i don't think it is an morally optional choice, even if it just buys 4 years."

Why it matters: The letter comes as Biden is seeking to consolidate support among progressives who prefer Sen. Bernie Sanders' more aggressive climate platform.

What they're saying: ""We are confident that, unlike President Trump, Joe Biden will respect, collaborate with, and listen to leaders in the scientific community and public health experts to confront the existential climate crisis and other environmental threats,"" the letter states.

""Biden‚Äôs plan to address climate change leads with science and facts and pledges U.S. leadership on climate action,"" it states.
Who they are: Signatories include the prominent Penn State climate scientist Michael Mann and Jane Lubchenco, who ran NOAA under former President Obama.

Catch up fast: Biden yesterday signaled that he plans to expand his climate platform. And Sanders' endorsement of Biden last week included the announcement of plans to form joint policy ""task forces,"" with climate among the topics."

1271,2020-04-21 23:24:21,g5g0jw,This election determines the once-a-decade congressional redistricting with our State House votes. This election determines how gerrymandered we are for the next decade. Mostly Republicans drew the lines last time. Vote blue down-ticket!
1272,2020-04-21 23:25:06,g5g0jw,I mean... of course.  Who else would they endorse... trump?
1273,2020-04-21 23:32:12,g5g0jw,There is no good reason why they really should but I'll take it!
1274,2020-04-21 23:33:13,g5g0jw,"While Biden is certainly better than Trump on climate change, his climate change plans don't go far enough.  We need something as big as Bernie's Green New Deal in order to avoid the worst effects of climate change.  This is an issue which we cannot compromise on.  The survival of civilization depends on it.  Biden needs to be pushed to make much bigger plans for climate change."

1282,2020-04-22 00:58:00,g5g0jw,He wasn't even in my top 3 choices but he'd be infinitely better than what we currently have.
1283,2020-04-22 01:03:49,g5g0jw,Bidens a decent choice.  Really super easy decision here.
1284,2020-04-22 01:12:29,g5g0jw,I think they made the wrong choice.
1285,2020-04-22 01:41:08,g5g0jw,He looks like every president in a disaster film.
1286,2020-04-22 02:05:25,g5g0jw,Sadly what we need are selfish rich bigots to endorse him.  That's really the demographic that we're missing the most.

I am seriously contemplating not having kids because bringing them into that situation is going to be a shitshow."
1291,2020-04-22 03:10:10,g5g0jw,He would do a better job than Trump. And that‚Äôs not saying a lot.

For real though, you can find scientists and climate experts who believe in Big foot - their endorsement means nothing. Unless the title was cut short, and they endorse his use in Alzheimer‚Äôs medication"

I'd like to see him get on board with the broad spending in the GND, but the combination of carbon taxes and nuclear power seems like the fastest way to reduce CO2 from electricity."
1300,2020-04-22 13:25:04,g5g0jw,"Just so were clear, endorsing biden when the alternative is destroying the EPA and doesn't believe in climate change doesn't make Biden a good climate candidate

Biden: F- (37.5%)"

Tara Reade: 

Told multiple individuals she knew at the time and didn't wait for 30 years?

Actually had a verified connection with Biden?

Has circumstantial evidence established years ago and now?

Comes from the SAME political party?

Has a consistent story that hasn't changed?

Is consistent with Biden's behavior?

Has a story that makes sense on planet earth?

Nope, sorry. I'm not buying it. It's not credible and heart-wrenching like the tale from the hero that is Chrstine Blasey-Ford."

So 50 scientists represent ""scientists?""

The American Physical Society alone has well over [50 THOUSAND members](https://www.aps.org/membership/statistics/index.cfm).

I guess a title of ""50 Scientists and climate experts endorse Joe Biden for president "" wouldn't sound as impressive."

1312,2020-04-21 19:19:38,g5g0jw,"I think a critically important aspect of a Biden presidency would just be to start going in the right direction again. A green new deal would be great - we could solve climate change once and for all - but some progress is better than negative progress. Per capita CO2 emissions fell under Obama in spite of a growing economy. Biden can at least replicate that with executive orders on green energy subsidies, vehicle fuel mileage, etc.

We need to be doing everything we can as fast as we can to limit damage from climate change as much as we can. We should all pressure politicians to do more. We also need to do what we can to elect politicians who will do at least something.

The choice between Trump and Biden is clear. Make things worse with Trump, or make things better but not as fast they should be with Biden."
1313,2020-04-21 21:51:25,g5g0jw,Alright guys that wraps it up. The people who know more than you know what's best for you. why won't you just vote for him already

I know the Ukraine scandal is ridiculous and a political ploy by Trump and his nefarious flock to stir up Fox News fodder to hurt his aspirations to get elected; but it's going to work.  Joe Biden is not a good choice.  The DNC should have embraced Bernie.  Our country as we know it is on the line.  Trump and Putin are very satisfied with this mistake.  I will vote for Biden of course, but damn is he a bad candidate.

Edit:. Can't wait until the October surprise.  It's going to be something like Bidens head poorly dubbed over Trumps having underage girls piss on a bed.

Edit:. For those down voting, I get it.  But any reasonable person knows I'm right.  Biden is NOT a good candidate.  The DNC is stupid stupid stupid.  Trump is probably going to beat Biden.  We're probably fucked."

1320,2020-04-21 17:36:58,g5g0jw,If you actually care about climate change you should probably vote Green because their platform looks to address climate issues instead of tax consumers so it's just looks like they're doing something.

1328,2020-04-21 21:04:35,g5g0jw,First of all Biden will take all advise from experts in their field and excute said plans. He has too he has know idea what‚Äôs going on.

Biden is an old rapist who thinks it's the 80s. He won't do *shit* on climate change, and if you think you can trust him then I have a 2016 election to sell you."

Then there's also the reports of voter supression and the massive exit poll discrepancies. Showing Bernie doing better where there are paper ballots and Biden doing better where there are electronic voting machines. It's literally 2016 all over again."

Yea I can't vote for this guy. There's no concessions. The Dems aren't even really putting any effort behind getting him elected. They're literally just expecting us to vote for Biden because ""lesser"" evil, even though he's literally sundowning. Biden doesn't want real change and wants to keep the same conditions that led to Trump in the first place. What happens if we elect Biden then get a young charismatic ""Trump"" in the 2024 elections?

I'm voting Green in November. It's not much, but I can't participate in this circus. I'm gonna try and get the Greens to 5% so they can present a viable alternative and force the Dems to coalition with us, as opposed to putting up a sundowning old rapist as a ""compromise"" candidate."

His college plan is progressive, and his climate stance is to the left of trump to be sure and can probably be said to have proggressive elements to it but Biden is not a proggresive.

Every time a nuclear plant gets shut down natural gas ramps up to meet the electricity demand. Biden's combination of a carbon tax and nuclear power research and expansion is the fastest way to decarbonize electricity generation which down the line gives us a better gain on electric vehicles.
1461,2020-04-21 19:26:51,g5g0jw,"Biden was one of the few few candidates even supportive of advanced nuclear let alone current gen nuclear, and if we want to actually solve the climate castrophy, nuclear has to be a part of the solution/piece of the puzzle.  

NASA, the IPCC, and James Hansen (the father of climate change), all agree that we need nuclear, and they even agree it‚Äôs saved lives. 

Even after decades of closures and negative coverage and bias, nuclear power generates 20% of this countries power. That same 20% is also responsible for over 55% of our clean energy. The facts remains, when we close nuclear, be it in Vermont, Germany, or Japan, emissions go up. Progressives need to step it the fuck up in this area, and soon.

No. Go ahead and think about it hard. Think about it at length.

Think about the generation of conservative federal and Supreme Court justices that the GOP are desperately slamming through in the middle of a viral pandemic, whowill make any progressive agenda near-impossible regardless of who‚Äôs president

Think about the fact that the guy in charge right now used our national security apparatus to try and force an allied country to manufacture dirt on his primary opponent and how he‚Äôs currently blocking all oversight into whether he‚Äôs emptying tax dollars into his own pockets as part of this bailout. Think about how he is firing every oversight offical.

Think about the fact that he has completely bungled the response to the Coronavirus and is actively seizing protective equipment from states and hospitals to reallocate them for political reasons, while asking us to die for the economy while failing to deliver on testing that could prevent much of the economic fallout by targeted rather than broad quarantine.

Think about the wholesale [regulation stripping by the Trump admin that is directly harming vulnerable populations, mostly children, including tens of thousands of new asthma hosptializations and millions exposed to lead and other chemicals with NO monitoring or oversight](https://www.ewg.org/news-and-analysis/2020/02/report-after-three-years-trump-kids-are-not-alright).

Now think about Biden‚Äôs actual platform that he‚Äôs running on which, whether you think it‚Äôs enough or not, *is actually to the left of Obama‚Äôs campaigns*. Things like:

-15 Dollar Min Wage.

-Public Option with a $0 premium option for low income, is completely separate from employers, and expanded medicaid, all of which would *drastically* lower the cost of insurance and fix many of the issues with Obamacare while also allowing people the choice the majority actually wants.

-12 weeks paid leave.

-Elimination of cash bail/mandatory minimums

-Supports Warren's bankruptcy protections (considered the most progressive in the field by anyone paying attention to politics).

-Pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, including support for DACA.

-Would support outlawing ""right to work"" legislation federally.

-Rejoin Paris, supports nuclear, supports carbon tax and dividend, 0 emissions in 25 years.

-Repeal Trump tax cuts, restore regulations regarding environment, employers.

-Re-enter Iran deal as best as possible today.

-Replace SCOTUS members and Federal Judges with ACTUAL JUDGES rather than far-right anti-progressive ideologues with no experience.

Think about all that and realize that the choice is literally between ‚ÄúBetter than Obama‚Äù or ‚ÄúLiterally the Worst President of All Time who is directly killing people‚Äù.

Anyone who is making this out to be a hard choice or one that you need to hold your nose for is not in possession of all the facts, or else does not have the best interests of Americans at heart."

Meanwhile Biden was making bills in the 80's to mitigate climate change, is going with a Carbon Tax which economists do think is a viable way of lowering carbon emissions, and have been effective in places they've been tried, and has a legit plan to get us carbon neutral by 2050.  And thats of course ignoring that Trump still fucking thinks Climate Change is a Hoax, and has actively worked against any policy meant to address it.

Only to be replaced with.. a coal lobbyist. Andrew Wheeler. By the way, Wheeler worked under Inhofe, the Senator who brought a snowball into the Senate floor to ""prove"" climate change isn't real.

Also, Biden was VP during the most pro-environment regulation movement in history under Obama. ...Which Trump has subsequently demolished.

There's no comparison between the two in regards to climate and environment."

The funny thing is if they had just made fun of his gaffes normally, like people have literally always done to his gaffes, it might have had helped them more, but claiming he had ""dementia"" when he obviously doesn't just made people ignore them"

Biden has regularly reached out to the black caucus and worked with them on getting their candidates elected and their favored policies passed. He's got a step by step plan that he can enact with executive power to combat racism in the justice system, a plan proven to be effective before.

Bernie marched with MLK, patted himself on the back, and has barely paid lip service to racial issues since. He has explicitly said that the democratic party focuses *too much* on racial issues. In his entire career he's only met with the black caucus twice. His plan to fight racism is a vague ""I'll fight racism.""

I voted for Bernie twice because I wanted the party pulled left on healthcare, but the guy has some serious issues when it comes to race."

That doesn't mean that I hate you or think bad things should happen to you, on the contrary, you have the right to your opinions just as much as I do, it just means that we're so different that unless we liked the same sports teams, we may as well be different species."
1640,2020-04-21 19:44:44,g5g0jw,"Yes, but 'better than trump' doesn't make a 'good' president. George Bush was in many ways, better than Trump. Should we start considering him a 'good' president too?

You're letting Trump lower your bar on what constitutes a good president which isn't something we should allow.

A good percentage of the US population would be 'better than Trump.' that doesn't mean any of them would be a good fit for the office.

I'll take Biden because there's no one else who can realistically win(Write ins don't work) but I'm not going to pretend he's anywhere close to good or what we need. In fact, I'm pretty damn glad he's not planning on running for a second term as of now."

Pollution had gotten so bad that rivers were literally burning. The environmental movement was gaining influence, and the public was going to force congress to act to enshrine environmentalism nationally.

Nixon enacted the EPA as a move of desperation. It was easier to have an executive organization that looked like it was effective in order to shut up the population. It worked. Sweeping environmental laws never made it to congress, and it allowed the Republicans to chip away at it piece by piece over the next 50 years until it's basically useless.

Nixon enacted the EPA specifically to hamstring public support for a true environmental strategy."

If you need additional resources, I would encourage you to have a look at the nuts-and-bolts of trump‚Äôs EPA policies. It‚Äôs all too easy to get completely distracted by twitter videos framed to illicit emotional reactions, but at the end of the day the most important thing for the environment in America is the very detailed and boring mechanisms that power the EPA. As much as we‚Äôd like to compare trump and Biden entirely on vague public statements and what we think they imply; that‚Äôs about as accurate as palm-reading. A better method is to compare the real world actions of the EPA under trump to a combination of the progress made under Obama‚Äôs EPA (which was real, and in fact the most climate action in American history as of yet), and the clear stated policy positions and cabinet members of Biden. 

There is already more than enough information to know that there is zero chance Biden and trump do the same damage the planet, as well as zero chance they both do the same good or set us on the course to do the same good. 

Think about the political scandal Biden would have for vetoing a green new deal under a democratically controlled congress. Now think about how much trump‚Äôs base would cheer if Biden loses but congress is still blue, but trump still vetos the green new deal."

> 1. He has supported campaign finance reform including the McCain-Feingold Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act and banning contributions of issue ads and gifts; capital punishment as his 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act created several new capital offenses; deficit spending on fiscal stimulus in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009; tax credits for students; carbon emissions cap and trade; the increased infrastructure spending proposed by the Obama administration; mass transit, supporting Amtrak, bus, and subway subsidies for decades; renewable energy subsidies; same-sex marriage; student loan forgiveness; increased taxation of the wealthy; and expanding upon the Affordable Care Act, rather than establishing a Medicare for All system. He supports decriminalizing cannabis on a Federal level and supports a state's right to legalize it on a state level, and prefers the reduced military spending proposed in the Obama administration's fiscal year 2014 budget.

>1. As president, He has pursued sizable income tax cuts, deregulation, increased military spending, rollbacks of federal health-care protections, and the appointment of conservative judges consistent with conservative (Republican Party) policies. However, his anti-globalization policies of trade protectionism cross party lines. In foreign affairs he has described himself as a nationalist. He has said that he is ""totally flexible on very, very many issues.""

>2.  He rejects the scientific consensus on climate change, repeatedly contending that global warming is a ""hoax."" He has said that ""the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive,"" a statement which He later said was a joke. However, it was also pointed out that he often conflates weather with climate change.


So personally I think this is already a pretty good case in favor of Biden and not in favor of Trump. At least if you're at all progressive in some way."

Your opinion is noted, but seeing as how it's impossible to go back in time and change votes, it is what it is and you're just going to have to deal with it in a way that makes sense for you."
1685,2020-04-21 22:06:49,g5g0jw,"I mean personally I have no problem with saying I prefer a Paris accord over no international climate agreements. I think it‚Äôs astoundingly childish to downplay the insane importance of the Paris accords and international cooperation for climate relief, just to virtue signal the need for more. Frankly, what good is aggressive American climate policy if we aren‚Äôt part of bringing the whole world there? The seas would still rise. 

And the most important point: no one said that we can‚Äôt do more than the Paris accords just because Biden stated that was his goal. It‚Äôs unbelievably counterproductive to turn your nose up at a progressive policy that would be make the world a better place, just to hold progressive policies hostage on the count of needing more action immediately. 

If you want an aggressive carbon tax or a green new deal, what convinced you those ideas would be popular before we‚Äôve even gotten the country to pass common-sense climate action? 

I‚Äôm reminded of the EU, where the EU makes it very clear to member nations that they can‚Äôt simply force their population to adopt the EU‚Äôs policy - just because it‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù In a democracy, you aren‚Äôt simply beholden to doing the best for the population, but you have a complex goal of doing what your population will support, while educating your population on how the policy is needed and will be implemented. 

If you‚Äôd like to see American be more active on climate, you do indeed have to do it the Democratic way. When choosing your vote on the ballot in November, it‚Äôs not simply which candidate do you ‚Äútrust‚Äù more, it‚Äôs which candidate has the incentive to do the right thing in order to maintain their support. 

For the the next four years, every progressive bill Biden doesn‚Äôt push for or vetos will see him raked through the coals by the *progressives* who will vote for him. Trump will receive pats on the back every time he expands federal power and restricts individual rights by the *fascists* who support him. 

‚ÄúThe lesser of two evils‚Äù is a remarkably childish way to say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt choose the greatest evil, choose what‚Äôs best for yourself and your people‚Äù and the answer is unquestionably Biden (+ as many progressive congresspeople and state/local reps as can fit in the buildings)"

Every politician that‚Äôs been a politician for decades is going to have baggage because of changing *public* attitudes. That‚Äôs true of Biden, but also of Bernie and Warren and the rest of them.

Slight correction. The (Social Democratic/Green coalition) Schr√∂der government of 1998-2005 started the phase-out of nuclear power. This was, and is, a core tenet of the German Green Party and a condition for them entering *coalition negotiations with Schr√∂der's SPD. 

When Merkel came to power in 2005, she (more likely, certain forces in her conservative party) lobbied for an ""exit from the exit"", which in practice meant extending the remaining operation time of existing nuclear power plants.   

Make of it what you will, but German public opinion has been in its majority sceptical of nuclear power since at least Chernobyl, so there was no outright reversal of the Schr√∂der policy.  

Then Fukushima happened, and Merkel blitzed in front of the cameras announcing the complete exit from nuclear power, claiming that Fukushima had opened her eyes to the dangers.  

Personally, I suspect she never cared either way and, being the tactician that she is, was looking for an out from the nagging nuclear lobby in her party, which was trying to force her down an unpopular route. 

And coincidentally, her decision also had the advantage of taking the wind from the sails of the Green party at that time (in our multi-party system, the Greens are a force to be reckoned with, just like the other smaller or ""smaller"" parties)."
1858,2020-04-22 04:58:39,g5g0jw,"Not only Fukushima. Germany was also hit very hard with fallout from Chernobyl, like many other parts in Europe.

Another huge thing in Germany, now compared to countries like the US is that Germany is extremely densely populated.

Nuclear energy doesn't just mean running reactors, which may or may not have certain risks. It also means that spent radioactive waste must be transported, and then re-cycles or safely stored  (for centuries).

We had huge protests in the 80s (from what I can remember) as people where opposed that potentially radioactive material is transported on trains going through towns.

They also opposed building nuclear re-processing plants, where spent nuclear rods would be re-processed for use.

Would you want some giant factory that handles radioactive materials right in your neighborhood, so to speak?

TLDR: Germany really, really doesn't like nuclear, for various reasons which IMO are valid.

Germany is also (compared to some other countries) VERY progressive/alternative/""back to nature""...so good luck convincing Germany that nuclear energy is something good. (And the protests and anti-stances I remember were decades BEFORE Fukushima).

Was the exit from Nuclear not smart and premature? May well be. But let me assure you, I think Germans are fine with that."

Good, but when looking at a convict trump *and* another 4 years of overall stagnation I cannot agree on the premise of this comment overall.

Many things, most importantly climate are past the point of being able to accept incremental change over decades--that will kill millions.

I also don't believe centrist politics have done enough at all to actually change things, if it were, we wouldn't be having the same issues today that were being talked about 20-30 years ago.

We desperately *need* more drastic change than what we have, and sorry, most progressives do not agree on 'incremental change' as we've been seeing it so far.

IMO, the 1st step is forcing states to move away from winner-take-all allotment of EC delegates. Of course that's no easy feat, and will take flipping many a state legislature, but it's a start. Look at Maine. their ranked choice voting system is prime for multi-party politics, or no-party politics. States are the key.

2nd, the national popular vote initiative is a 1st step in moving away from the flawed EC which gives disproportionate influence to the smaller (population) states at the expense of the democratic process and the will of the people.

Also, if you think actually acknowledging for example climate change and working to reverse it, or giving poor people healthcare, or reducing military spending are just ""very standard, run of the mill, small changes to the edges"", then you seriously need to reconsider your values, or at least read and study about policies.

If that was the case, then great, because Biden is polling way above Trump and has much higher favorability. And Hillary was a great candidate with actually good ideas on the table.

I've just been reading about this stuff recently and am super curious, so please correct me where I'm wrong.

My understanding is that if we had greatly expanded storage projects, and more long distance high voltage lines, we'd be able to vastly increase our use of wind and solar to the point that we could retire most if not all coal and gas plants. Nuclear power still takes about a day to fully start up I think, so it can't even respond to sudden demand surges the way coal or gas plants, or large scale batteries, can. From what I know, the economics of the way the grids buy electricity makes storage projects have little to no ROI in many cases. If we can change that through public investment, we could have a lot more storage ready to pick up when demand surges, clouds roll in, wind stops blowing etc.

I wonder because I know that nuclear plants take a long time to build and are incredibly expensive up front, which makes private investors pretty uninterested, and we don't really have the time remaining to wait around for the market to fix itself."
2009,2020-04-21 21:02:25,g5g0jw,I'm not expert but the key difference separating nuclear from wind and solar is the scalability ability. Wind and solar are dependent on the weather and difficult to scale up. Nuclear you can just make the reaction go faster or slower depending on demand. A good energy system for a nation needs the ability to ramp up and down the energy it outpusts. If you don't have that then you wont have dependable energy.

This is a direct example of what you asked for. Biden went from voting against a progressive issue to arguing against the GOP trying to ban it in the Senate to endorsing it on television which forced the Obama admin to *explicitly* take the position in spite of controversy, a complete and meaningful 180 over the course of a few decades on a major issue.

If you‚Äôre going to argue in bad faith and refuse to acknowledge direct evidence that doesn‚Äôt support your existing emotionally-based (rather than fact-based) position, then you might as well go do it somewhere else.

As they fizzled out one by one they jumped to the next one. Then came full circle back to biden as the rest all drop out right after the establishment pleaded for it.

Sorry, you would be an idiot to not vote for Biden at this point but let's not pretend everything was fair and balanced; from media coverage to the dem leadership.

Funny to watch from an outside perspective how a country with over 320 million people and all those bright minds can end up with these weak choices each election cycle.  Boarderline dementia patients."

2253,2020-04-21 18:20:13,g5g0jw,"Isn't there though? My understanding is that there's plenty of sunshine and wind for the power we need, the grid just doesn't like it because it's unpredictable variable input. We sometimes have to turn off turbines and let the electricity go to waste if it gets too windy and the transmission lines or demand can't handle it. Storage is newer but certainly feasible technologically, and there are obviously still improvements to be made in density, lifespan, and cost effectiveness. But the only obstacles I know of are economic, nothing to do with technical feasibility.

Nukes have a similar problem, compounded with a huge amount of regulatory uncertainty about whether you can even get a permit to build one, and if so, how many delays there are along the way because of that (something I'd hope we can change as well)."

It's yet to reach a point where it's cheap enough and easy enough that it explodes the way wind and solar did, but that's as much an economic issue as it is technical in my view. Given how little time there is to decarbonize, I'd rather deal with it from both sides (research to bring the cost down, and investments in what's available now).

Republican leadership has expressed envy at the Democratic party to suppress the candidates they do not like through the use of tricks like superdelegates and changing the debate rules when it suits them.

Sources such as [these](https://tdmsresearch.com/2020/03/04/massachusetts-2020-democratic-party-primary/) [two](https://thegrayzone.com/2020/03/09/grayzone-codepink-international-election-observers-oas-2020-democratic-primary/) make the claim that exit polls varied wildly from the exit poll results in states such as Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. These claims are misleading at best and manipulative at worst. They compare the exit poll results at the time of closing of the polls to the final results and claim a significant mismatch, which while technically true is wildly misleading. Exit pollers are not omniscient, and continue to make changes, sometimes significant ones, to the exit polls throughout the day, and well into the night. The final update to many of these exit polls didn't come until 10 or 11 that night, well after polls closed.

Let's do some comparison, using the actual exit poll results as reported by [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/entrance-and-exit-polls/) and the official results per the [Associated Press](https://www.ap.org/en-us/topics/politics/elections/counting-the-vote) via google.

Massachusetts
Final Result: Biden 33.6%
Exit Poll: Biden 34%

New Hampshire
Final Result: Biden 8.4%
Exit Poll: Biden 8%

South Carolina
Final Result: Biden 48.4%
Exit Poll: Biden 48%

Texas
Final Result: Biden 34.5%
Exit Poll: Biden 34%

Virginia
Final Result: Biden 53.2%
Exit Poll: Biden 54%

Vermont:
Final Result: Biden 22.0%
Exit Poll: Biden 22%

Washington
Final Result: Biden 37.9%
Exit Poll: Biden 38%

Florida
Final Result: Biden 62.0%
Exit Poll: Biden 63%

So on and so forth for all the primary states. I lied, Biden didn't even consistently overperform, he was ahead about as often as he was behind the exit poll, never by more than 1%.

Note that results varied more widely in states with caucuses, due to the viability threshold.

I calculated the exit poll numbers by eyeballing a weighted average of the male and female results, since those were the easiest to do without a calculator. I couldn't find the margin of error listed, so call them 1% if you don't trust my math.

Allowing Trump and the GOP 4 more years will 100% worsen every symptom that led to his rise, most notably the erosion of democracy and increasing electoral power of a radical right-wing minority.

It's also why the Pete/Amy endorsement extravaganza worked so well: it illustrated that Joe Biden was the candidate to defeat Trump. That's why his polling shifted dramatically after that moment.

Democratic voters priority was above all things voting for a candidate who could defeat Donald Trump. Look at the exit polling w/r/t healthcare or the environment. People want Medicare for All, they want a Green New Deal, but they believe Donald Trump is an existential threat and that Biden is best positioned to take him out.

Sanders gained support since 2016 in terms of overall popularity and support of policy, which did not translate into delegates the primaries, which was a highly competitive, progressive field that often ran counter to one another's campaigns despite having very similar agendas on paper, in that the cross pollination of of these voters were wildly split between Pete, Warren, Bernie, and  It's a testament to Bernie's increased popularity since 2016 that [he won the states that he did,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bernie-sanders-is-the-front-runner/) which is impressive given the odds, [but what a run](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-bernie-sanders-lost/) from a guy who isn't even a Democrat, facing an uphill battle against the establishment. 

This all while trying very hard not to even mention the animal that is systemic voter suppression and how this manifests in the primaries  result oft staging manifests as  that contrasts against the staging of the primaries due to it's obtuse staging and rules that undoubtedly has an effect on the wider populace as the early states inevitably control the narrative early and all of those moderate dominos start to fall in the states that follow. Nonetheless, I digress and I hope that Biden beats Trump, though I have little no confidence in him pulling this off.

Yes, it does. Let's see what Biden's platform has for Sanders supporters *if we continue to go down the list*. A rough summary of Sanders' platform can be found [here](https://www.politico.com/2020-election/candidates-views-on-the-issues/bernie-sanders/). Here are the points on which Sanders and Biden **are in agreement**:

Capital Punishment / Death Penalty: Abolish it

Cash Bail Reform: End it

Cocaine Sentencing Disparities: Scrap the disparity

Mandatory Minimum Sentences Reform: Eliminate them

Private Prisons: Eliminate them

Minimum Wage: Raise the federal minimum wage to $15/hour

Reparations: Study reparations

Teacher Pay: Boost teacher pay

Campaign Finance: Unlimited spending should not be allowed in politics

Farming and Climate Change: Pay farmers to adopt climate-friendly practices

Rights for Farm Owners and Workers: Expand farm worker protections

Assault Weapons: Support a voluntary buyback program

Background Checks: In favor of universal background checks

DACA: Citizenship for Dreamers

Marijuana Convictions: Scrapping past pot convictions

Capital Gains Taxes: Increase the capital gains tax rate

Social Media: We should consider holding companies legally liable for user posts [I personally feel that this one is unworkable, and that *both* Sanders and Biden are wrong on this point, but never mind...]

Is Biden as progressive as Sanders? No. Are there areas of disagreement between them? Yes, many. But to say Biden has *nothing* to appeal to Sanders supporters is just disingenuous.

There are other areas where Sanders and Biden are in *partial agreement*. For example, whereas Sanders wants to legalize marijuana Federally, Biden wants to decriminalize it. Biden goes on to say that he'd leave the question of legalizing marijuana up to the states, which is *the same situation that would come to pass were marijuana legalized Federally*. The Federal government (under most circumstances) cannot make states legalize things. That's why there are still dry counties even though we repealed Prohibition.

If Sanders is at 10 and Trump is at 0, Biden is at 6 or 7. Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.

ETA: I should make it clear that I am a Sanders supporter. My state's primary hasn't occurred yet, and I fully intend to vote for Sanders. I'd prefer if Sanders were the nominee. Nevertheless, I am continually dumbfounded by the insistence by some Sanders supporters that Biden has *no* progressive planks to his platform, or that Biden and Trump are somehow indistinguishable. This is quite obviously false."

Cuba's health system is the most robust in the world thanks to their explicitly socialist health and education policy. Socialism turned a feudal colonial playpen into a fully industrialized economy in China, and although they've practically abandoned marxism, the capitalist system Maoism birthed is rising up to challenge the unipolar American hegemony.

Resulting in generational culture where to this day exists as a reflection to the poverty their families had to endure from Anglo society backlash. Or would you prefer the countless examples through American history showing how legislation consistently was designed to put African Americans into unfavorable and unfair positions? You know, kinda what Biden coauthored? Fascinating how you will defend the man that willingly wanted to impose laws that are designed racist while the other guy wanted to systemically get rid of such legislation and help communities in a manner that he knows he can. Racism will likely always exist, however, our laws are a malleable and designed with intent."
2314,2020-04-22 19:23:23,g5g0jw,"This has got to be the dumbest argument. The reason to stop focusing on racism is because classism is the root of a lot of the systemic racism in this country.

In the early 1980s, Leeds was a businesswoman at a paper company on a flight from the Midwest, returning to New York. A flight attendant offered her an empty seat in the first-class cabin next to Trump.

""His hands were everywhere. It was an assault.

On October 14, 2016, The Washington Post reported an allegation by Kristin Anderson.[84] Anderson said that Trump groped her beneath her skirt in a Manhattan nightclub in the early 1990s.


Lisa Boyne (1996)
On October 13, 2016, The Huffington Post reported an allegation by Lisa Boyne.[85] Boyne said Sonja Morgan (then Sonja Tremont) invited her to a dinner with Trump, modeling agent John Casablancas, and five or six models. Boyne alleged that Trump made the models walk across the table, looked under their skirts, and described if they were wearing underwear. Morgan told The Huffington Post that the dinner took place with those participants, did not recall lewd behaviour by Trump, and said: ""But I have been known to dance on tables."" Boyne said she called her roommate Karen Beatrice that night to inform her about the incident. The Huffington Post contacted Beatrice, who denied any such call


Cathy Heller (1997)
On October 15, 2016, The Guardian reported an allegation by Cathy Heller that she was grabbed and kissed by Donald Trump two decades earlier.[87] Heller said that, in 1997, she met Trump when she attended a Mother's Day brunch with her children, her husband, and her husband's parents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Her parents-in-law were members of Mar-a-Lago. Heller was introduced to Trump, who became angry when she avoided a kiss. He then ""grabbed"" her and, when he tried to kiss her, she turned her head. Trump kissed her on the side of the mouth ""for a little too long"" and then he left her. Heller's husband and children, who were present during the event, have corroborated her account. In the summer of 2015, the members of Heller's mahjong group heard Heller's account of the 1997 incident; this was not long after Trump announced his candidacy.[89] She decided to go public after seeing the second presidential debate on October 9, 2016. Heller is a registered Democrat, and public supporter of Hillary Clinton.Trump campaign spokesperson Jason Miller said Heller's account is ""false"" and ""politically motivated""


Temple Taggart McDowell (1997)
In May 2016, The New York Times reported allegations by Temple Taggart McDowell.[90] McDowell, who was Miss Utah USA in 1997, accused Trump of unwanted kisses and embraces that left McDowell and one of her chaperones so uncomfortable, according to McDowell, that she claimed she was instructed not to be left in a room alone with him again. According to McDowell, a chaperone had accompanied her to Trump's office.[91] At the time, McDowell was 21 and was known as Temple Taggart.[3] This incident occurred in Trump's first year of ownership of the Miss USA contest.McDowell told her story initially to The New York Times in May 2016[91] which was published in the ""Crossing the Line: How Donald Trump Behaved With Women in Private"" article. She had not intended to speak publicly about the incidents again, but she received numerous calls recently due to the ""Crossing the Line"" article and felt, as a mother, that it is important to share a message about unwanted advances: ""You have the right to say no. You have the right to get out of there. You have the right to leave, and you have the right to make them feel uncomfortable if they're making you feel uncomfortable,"" she said. Trump said he does not know her and denied McDowell's claims. He also told The New York Times he is ""reluctant to kiss strangers on the lips"".Taggart McDowell said she is a Republican, and not coming out with the allegation in order to support Hillary Clinton


Karena Virginia (1998)
At an October 2016 press conference with attorney Gloria Allred, yoga instructor and life coach Karena Virginia said that in 1998 Trump grabbed her arm and touched her breast. Virginia, who was 27 years old at the time, was waiting for a ride after the US Open in Queens, New York. She said Trump, whom she had not met previously, approached her with a small group of other men, while commenting on her legs, then he grabbed her right arm. Virginia continued, ""Then his hand touched the right side of my breast. I was in shock. I flinched. 'Don't you know who I am? Don't you know who I am?'‚Äîthat's what he said to me. I felt intimidated and I felt powerless."" Trump campaign spokesperson Jessica Ditto responded to the allegation with a statement reading in part, ""Discredited political operative Gloria Allred, in another coordinated, publicity seeking attack with the Clinton campaign, will stop at nothing to smear Mr. Trump


Mindy McGillivray (2003)
In an October 2016 article by The Palm Beach Post, Mindy McGillivray stated that in January 2003, when she was 23 years old, she was groped by Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate.[3][77] She said, ""All of a sudden I felt a grab, a little nudge. I think it's [my friend Ken Davidoff's] camera bag, that was my first instinct. I turn around and there's Donald. He sort of looked away quickly.""[3] Ken Davidoff, a photographer, corroborated McGillivray's account, saying he remembered her pulling him aside moments after the alleged incident to say ""Donald just grabbed my ass!""[77]


McGillivray said she ""chose to stay quiet""[74] and never reported the incident to authorities. She had shared details of the incident only with close family and friends until she heard Trump deny such behavior during the second presidential debate on October 9, 2016. Hope Hicks, Trump's press secretary, said McGillivray's allegations lacked ""any merit or veracity"" and were untruthful. Ken Davidoff's brother, Darryl Davidoff, said he was also present at the time at Mar-a-Lago and that in his opinion McGillivray is lying.[According to Darryl: ""I do not believe it really happened. Nobody saw it happen and she just wanted to be in the limelight.""

> Southern Democrats affected New Deal legislation in several ways. They carved out exceptions in bills regulating business‚Äîsuch as bills setting a minimum wage‚Äîfor farming and domestic service, since that was work performed in the South predominately by African-Americans. They retarded the growth of the labor movement and tried to block efforts to unionize in the South, suspecting, rightly, that unions were motors of racial integration. They defeated anti-lynching legislation by arguing, first, that lynching was technically illegal already and, second, that, since people are regularly murdered elsewhere in the United States, a federal anti-lynching law would be discriminatory.

> Most significant, though, they insured that the administration of New Deal policies was decentralized. They pried open the tax-levy coffers in Washington, but exercised strict control over how and to whom that money trickled down in their states. They tried to expand the regional economy without undermining apartheid. As the South has always done, they asserted the claim of states‚Äô rights at just the point when the shoe started to pinch, and not a moment before.

The exit poll results as of, say, 7:00 might only be representative of who had voted by 4:00 or 5:00. However, if the polls close at 7:00, what matters is who votes by 7, not what the votes were by 4 or 5. And remember that a lot of people will vote after 5:00--that's when people get off work.

The only play Bernie people like me have is to make it known to the establishment that they need to try harder to extend an olive branch to us. That can take many forms: non-voting, voting Green(With 5% of the vote, they are eligible for federal funding going forward, that would wake up the DNC) or pushing the DNC hard right now to start making concessions which is what they are doing. I don't think Bernie people want Trump to win but after seeing so many disgusting practices during the primary, many of them are just fed up with the process. 

In 2016 Michigan had about ~90k or so people leave the top presidential column blank. That means people came out to vote down ballot but left the top column blank. Trump won by ~10k(approx 2 votes per precinct). I worry that may repeat itself this time around."

2623,2020-04-21 14:12:59,g5fuwd,A lot of these appear to be him just stuttering I only mention that because people are actually trying to explain away the clear examples of dementia as him having a stutter which is laughable.
2624,2020-04-21 14:26:55,g5fuwd,It's so sad to watch.  But this is the best Democrat candidate and the Democrats must see something in him.  Imagine giving Biden the nuclear launch codes?
2625,2020-04-21 14:14:32,g5fuwd,I get more slurring then stuttering
2626,2020-04-21 15:20:10,g5fuwd,"Right.

These clips of a dotty old man saying the wrong thing are entertaining, maybe, but nothing more.

They're *funny* - but the clips of him with his nasty old hands caressing prepubescent girls is disgusting and troubling, and cannot be explained away.

...But so what?

When it comes down to it, arguing over which presidential  candidate is better than the other is arguing over which scumbag opportunist is better amongst a band of self-serving spokespeople."
2627,2020-04-21 15:45:46,g5fuwd,"I agree to the latter but my point to op was if your gonna make a video of Biden gaffs you should stick to the instances where he is clearly losing his ability to think otherwise people will use the stuttering excuse and certain clips would make that valid.

Heterosexual predators now have an incentive to *claim* to be gay. Thus, the gay population will necessarily contain predators that it wouldn't otherwise if gay marriage wasn't normalized.

> Two heterosexual people can still mess up a kid

That is irrelevant. I'm talking about policy for humanity as a whole. Edge cases don't help us to figure out that policy, and you raised an edge case.

Instead, nature and history helps us to figure out that policy.

The goal here is to do everything possible to minimize rape - even if doing so takes away what is currently considered to be a basic human right. There exists optimal political policies which minimize rape to the bare minimum.

That's *my* goal and my view, and I'm not changing. You are welcome to have your own goals, of course."

This remark is implying that homosexuality itself and the philosophy of the Left is connected to young boys being molested. This appears to be an ungrounded statement that you have chosen to defend using the specific knowledge that you have surrounding your beliefs, yet not about the topic at hand. 

This isn‚Äôt about gay marriage, it‚Äôs a direct attack on homosexuals. This remark is implying that homosexuality itself is connected to boys being raped. 

Anyway, let‚Äôs just pretend the highly unlikely scenario (unless you can prove otherwise, if you can I‚Äôll retract the highly unlikely bit) that two predators have evidently teamed up and are going to get married and pretend to be gay. Then what? They foster a child and continue to rape him? 

You do realize that foster children are often subjected to abuse, regardless of their foster parent or parent‚Äôs sexuality. Are we also saying the predators are ganging up on this kid? Because if I‚Äôm not mistaken, doesn‚Äôt sexual harassment of a child usually happen with only one parent? 

Your whole argument appears to be nothing more than blindly blaming gay marriage as a cause of child Molestation when plenty of perfectly straight men in relationships with women abuse children all the time, foster or birth. 

If you could please elaborate a bit more on your stance so that I can understand it better, that would be great."

Truly fascist rhetoric. Maybe we should just not allow white men to leave the house without handcuffs. It would most definitely decrease overall rape, seeing as they are the biggest contributors."

> Truly fascist rhetoric.

Label me however you want to label me. You should call me homophobic and a bigot, too.

Do you think I care how you label me?

Because I don't. Label away. Have a great old time.

You know what they call that? They call that ""ad hominem"".

So do that ""ad hominem"" thing, if that's how you roll, or, we could dig into the pros and cons of our positions and find out why we really disagree.

Because I will tell you right now why we disagree:

I want ALL rape to stop *if* that means that culturally speaking, all sex must be confined within a marriage. That, in other words, all non-procreative sex that is not repented ends up in people getting socially canceled.

A lot of big words you‚Äôre using in your argument, what a wonderful vocab you have. Personally, I enjoy talking to people with different beliefs, for not only does it strengthen my arguments, it makes me a little wiser being exposed to various viewpoints.

The problem is ALL men. Pedophiles are male. Female pedophiles technically exist but they can be ignored as we triage the most important issues to deal with.

No man should be allowed to adopt a child. Period. NEVER.

Instead, we should rely on what we see in nature. Namely, the female bears the child. Females should be the only ones allowed to adopt.

And don't get me started on biological sex versus gender. Predators have already figured out that they can self-label themselves as ""pre-op transgender butch lesbians"" and have a wonderful time at their local fitness center shower facilities as long as they want as much as they want.

Progressivism has failed. Accept that now or accept that later. Makes no difference to me."

Let's call that fact #1.

Fact #2 is, the children who were abused were abused BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. In other words, nobody with any authority to stop it knew at all about the abuse. The abuse behind closed doors was not a FACT until the movie SPOTLIGHT came out. I know Catholics who refused to accept this FACT until they saw the movie SPOTLIGHT.

Fact #3 is, the children who were abused DID NOT WANT TO BE ABUSED. They would have preferred it if their parents chose to attend a church which had no theological confusion (the filioque, in this case) which gave priests Messianic delusions, so they did whatever they wanted to do."

It‚Äôs as if you were invited to a debate about dogs being better than cats and prepare a speech, but on arrival you learn that the debate is actually about turtles vs lizards as pets. Every time I bring up a point about turtles, you start talking about dogs. 

Your arguments and facts do not apply to the conversation at all. I asked for facts supporting the whole ‚Äúpredators use gay marriage to rape children‚Äù. You respond by attacking the Catholic church and calling them out for their history of child molestation. If I were a Catholic, or even just a Christian or somebody who supported the Church that MIGHT be applicable. 

However, no one brought that up but you, it doesn‚Äôt apply and it seems like you just want to complain and appear smart so you just repeat random arguments you hear"

You guys can have the New Earth. Or, we'll take it. We don't care which one, we really don't.

I further assume that I could have at least one follower who actually does read what I post if I keep at this for the rest of my life.

My ENTIRE life is about finding that one follower who wants to read everything I post.

That is a continuum and not binary, yes? That correlates with the person's education, does it not? I mean, there aren't a lot of Eastern Orthodox Christians who can walk a theological newbie from Simulation Theory to ""God is Love"".

In other words, what I'm saying is, when the cats and dogs have been consumed by the predators, then predators will go after the turtles and the lizards. And *that* is why I must talk about turtles and lizards, because I don't want them to get eaten by the predators.

Predators will always find their prey if they are able to. They will take the path of least resistance, if such a path is available to them.

Catholic priesthood used to be such a path. It was a long, arduous path, but it worked. Become a priest, become respected in your community, and you will get to rape kids, fairly safely.

Today, the Catholic priesthood is *not* a very good path for the predators. So, they will look for *another* path.

My stance: those humans with my beliefs cannot coexist with those humans who do not share our beliefs.

For example. We refuse to accept gay marriage. Period, end of story.

So, let's get a divorce.

Okay?

Is this going to be a respectful divorce, or is this going to be a mean nasty one full of name-calling and non sequiturs?

LET'S GET A DIVORCE. It's a divorce of ideologies. Let's accept that we can never coexist. Just admit it okay? You'll feel better and you can move on with your life.

How about we do a survey on gay marriage? Let's see who is willing to roll it all back.

If 51% are willing to completely roll back gay marriage (if only due to perceived males misusing the ""pre-op transgender butch lesbian"" label so they can shower with females in their local fitness center), then would you say that perhaps that there is a possibility that you will be the loser in this ""natural selection""?"

Listen, I know you're angry Bernie lost but we need to get behind Biden. We cannot allow that man child to be in office for another 4 years.

If you don't vote for Biden, you voted for Trump no matter how you look at it. You're responsible if Trump gets re-elected. Don't complain about fascists ever again because you are the fascist now if you don't vote! Every single bad thing that Trump will do in his 2nd term, it's down to you guys because you are a Trump supporter if you don't vote Biden. Not all Trump supporters wear MAGA hats, the biggest Trump supporters are those ex Bernie supporters who refuse to go out and deny Trump victory on election day.

It's been almost 2 weeks now since Bernie dropped out and you've had your time to get angry at Biden, you guys need to stop posting anti Biden memes and pointing out everything you don't like about him. Trump doesn't even need to spend any money on his campaign when you guys are doing it for him, you're his slaves. I thought communists are against free labor?

You can't keep going on about Biden being a rapist when there's no evidence and even if he was, it doesn't fucking matter. You're never going to get that perfect candidate who has no dirt on him. Politics is a dirty world. Most of you loved him when he was VP calling him uncle Joe but now all of a sudden he's a rapist?

Bernie wasn't as perfect as you think he was. He wrote an essay fantasizing about women being gang raped by him in 1972. He's also pedophile. He was connected to Jeffery Epshtein and even molested his own granddaughter. Bernie's name used to be George before he changed his identity. Google: ""George Lamar Sanders."" That's Bernie Sanders who raped kids. Why have you not seen in pictures of Bernie Sanders and Epshtein together? Because they have not released those pics and were planning to blackmail him if he was the nominee. Those pics are from 2016 so he can't make the excuse he didn't know about it. We couldn't risk him being our nominee, there's too much sick shit they have on him. His computers were seized by the FBI and they found 50 terabytes of child sex abuse images.

I know you don't want to believe this but it's the truth and we have no choice to select Biden because the only lie they can make up about him is a rape with no evidence unlike Bernie who they have shit that will not only send him to prison for the few years he has left to live but also destroy the party.

This horrifying experience involves the popular app Roblox, dubbed the ‚Äúnumber one gaming site for kids.‚Äù With the second most accessible rating of PEGI 7, Roblox is recommended for children ages 7 and up and it currently has 64 million users. The game contains a multiplayer online gaming platform that allows users to create their own personal avatar, as well as their own adventures (similar to MineCraft). Roblox also provides the opportunity to interact with others‚Äô virtual realities, which is a popular feature of this game.

Roblox also has security settings that allow the parent to block outside conversations and invitations. There are also 24-hour moderators that are hired to block any potentially inappropriate content. When my husband and I decided to allow our daughter to play this game, we adjusted the security settings to maximum privacy. Or at least we THOUGHT we did...

While laying in bed with my daughter this morning, I was reading aloud to her from one of my favorite childhood chapter books. At the same time, she was playing her favorite game Roblox on her iPad while listening to the story. All of a sudden, she stopped me from reading and showed me her screen.

At first, I couldn‚Äôt believe what I was seeing. My sweet and innocent daughter‚Äôs avatar was being VIOLENTLY GANG-RAPED ON A PLAYGROUND by two males. A female observer approached them and proceeded to jump on her body at the end of the act. Then the 3 characters ran away, leaving my daughter‚Äôs avatar laying on her face in the middle of the playground.

Words cannot describe the shock, disgust, and guilt that I am feeling right now, but I‚Äôm trying to put those feelings aside so I can get this warning out to others as soon as possible. Thankfully, I was able to take screenshots of what I was witnessing so people will realize just how horrific this experience was. screenshots in comments for those who can stomach it Although I was immediately able to shield my daughter from seeing the entire interaction, I am shuddering to think of what kind of damage this image could have on her psyche, as well as any other child that could potentially be exposed to this.

Parents/Caregivers...I urge you to take another look at the security settings on all of your devices and closely supervise your child if you allow them to continue playing games with online platforms such as Roblox. Better yet, perhaps you can join me in taking the rest of this summer to challenge your child to PUT AWAY THEIR SCREENS....AND READ!!! Books cannot be hacked, but sadly, I‚Äôve learned the hard way that a child‚Äôs innocence can be just at the touch of a button.

Also, I urge people to share this post to get this important message out to others. I‚Äôm not sure that I‚Äôm prepared for all of the trolling and criticism, but I‚Äôll deal with it knowing that even one child can be spared from experiencing such a hideous situation.

Tulsi Gabbard and Marianne Williamson. Then, over the past few months, Reade began heavily retweeting pro-Sanders accounts and regularly engaging with prominent Sanders supporters like Halper.

Such hinting led ‚Äî as Reade told Salon, which Halper confirmed ‚Äî to an anonymous woman suggesting that Reade seek Halper out to tell her full story.

Hint: posting the same press releases from the accuser and accused every other day is not journalism.

Whitmer continued her support for Biden‚Äôs presidential run and expressed doubt in Reade‚Äôs allegation.

‚ÄúI have read a lot about this current allegation,‚Äù Whitmer said. ‚ÄúI know Joe Biden, and I‚Äôve watched his defense, and there‚Äôs not a pattern that goes into this and I think that for these reasons I‚Äôm very comfortable that Joe Biden is who he says he is.‚Äù

How can she claim that the multiple videos of him smelling little girls hair, rubbing their shoulders and the obvious uncomfortable feeling of the kids, along with the multiple women (8 at this time) who have accused him is ""not a pattern"".

So you go online and find formal debate between a Christian/Muslim and am Atheist/Agnostic.

It's going to take 2-3 years of stability before anyone should be comfortable being free without some sort of other adult family member to keep an eye on her. Someone who really cares like her mother or father. If she has a caring brother who is stronger than her that'll do too.

This is a very misleading statement. What you mean is (assuming the stats are correct) 90% of rape accusations don't get brought to court, and of the 10% that do, 77% of them are then found not guilty.

> I'm not sure you understand false memories. This is the whole point, they're not making stuff up. Or rather, they have no idea that they are. To them, they're recounting something that definitely happened.

From the research I‚Äôve gathered, almost all of the accounts of false memories are actually just details pertaining to the memory, not the memories themselves. It‚Äôs only in very rare scenarios that the memories themselves are fabricated, meaning that even if they can‚Äôt remember the exact step by step details, they still have the memory of the encounter.

> All I can say is that it seems awfully convenient that it lay dormant for years on years until these people are in, or about to be in, electable positions of power. I‚Äôm sorry but that does nothing to help their credibility.

Actually, it makes sense. Often what happens is that one person will accuse a person in power of assaulting or violating them. The people that that person has assaulted in the past will often speak up after the original person, seeing that they won‚Äôt be cast aside. And often, these people do attempt to go after the person that assaulted them, but it leads no where. As I‚Äôve said previously, only 1.5% of rape cases actually go anywhere, and that‚Äôs just the ones that get reported. So yea, once this person is under more scrutiny, people are able to come forward without being turned away or called liars.

Its a little ridiculous. The Catholic Church sometimes played this card during their sexual assault controversies and it was seen as ridiculous then.

Having false memories about something that never happened in any way is really not common. Having false memories of childhood or little details that your brain adds in is more common but that doesn't explain this incident.

It also very conveniently gets the democrats off the hook. They don't want this story to be true and they don't want to call someone making a sexual assault allegation a liar.

I believe that you‚Äôre twisting the stactics. Often the reason that the accused get off is due to the culture the surrounds the crime. For it to be proven, they have to prove that it was an assault involving intercourse and that it was forced. Now it‚Äôs easy for a defense lawyer to cast doubt on the victim, saying how she is ‚Äúpromiscuous‚Äù or ‚Äúasking for it‚Äù and often the courts believe it. Not to mention that rape offenses often aren‚Äôt the highest priority of the prosecutors or police. It is incredibly hard to convict someone of rape if there isn‚Äôt footage or onlookers, which their often isn‚Äôt. And due to rape culture, people seem to think that it‚Äôs not a big deal. 

Like I know from personal experience that despite being in high school, every single one of my female friends, myself included, has been sexually assaulted in some way. Whether that be grabbed, smacked on the ass, cat called etc. And despite being inside a school with 1,000 kids, nothing ever comes of it.

Man, you're just going all out on misrepresenting facts aren't you?

The list you gave is not what leads to a report being proven false, they're what reduces the chances of a case being brought to court. 

In order to prove a rape report false, you literally have to have evidence that the either the sex was consensual (this is the most common) or that it never happened in the first place.

> Where did you get that stat? Because I can‚Äôt find it anywhere. And what does it mean to be PROVEN true? What are the parameters?

I got it from you. You said 77% were found not guilty, which means 23% are found guilty. I'm willing to throw you a bone and forget about the possibility of innocent people going to jail, which is what allows you to say that 23% of rape cases being PROVEN true.

What do you not understand? I'm using your statistics, the ones that you are claiming are true. I'm willing to assume they're true, and use them.

Again, you brought up false reports, not me. You said 2-10% are proven false, which means the other 90-98% are true. 

As I've said, this is absolutely not what that means, it simply means the other 2-10% are not PROVEN false. It does not indicate whether the remaining 90+% are true or false at all.

The reason nobody is discussing baseless reports is because they're irrelevant. The 2-10% figure is for reports PROVEN false. Otherwise known as false reports. The 2-10% figure is NOT baseless reports, nor does it include baseless reports. 

Baseless reports are included within the other 90-98%, as you should already know.

3194,2020-05-03 19:10:52,gcraxh,"Here is the thing. On the left, there was never a consensus about the movement. Many on the left didn't think the Ford allegation was enough alone to prevent Kavanaugh, Kavanaugh's own judicial opinions on abortion and on other topics and the way he behaved on the witness stand, combined with pressure from people on our ""own side"" made the left seem way more unified than it was.

Franken's resignation remains broadly unpopular on the left, to the point where it pretty much sank Gillibrand's presidential run. Most people on the left including myself want abusers to be punished, but not without overwhelming evidence. We absolutely do not want the situation to be used as a political weapon. It is a full-on political weapon now. It's unfortunate that #metoo a movement that justifiably went after Weinstein and Cosby is also marred by politics, Hollywood narcissists, and opportunists. 

Yet, in this age of social media this should have been predictable, it was the only outcome."

3201,2020-05-03 16:08:32,gcraxh,"Very nice.

Personally, I believe that Louis C.K. cancellation was because of...

MARITAL RAPE WASN'T A CRIME, IN 1997!  NO ONE THOUGHT IF IT AS SUCH, UNTIL I EXISTED!

Wait, what does that have to do with what I was saying?  And who are you, anyway?  

I AM TWITTER.  AND WHAT I SAY, GOES.  I AM A MAGICAL DJINN.  ALL I HAVE TO DO IS STATE IT.  FOR EXAMPLE:

LOUIS C.K. IS A DANGEROUS AMERICAN!  HE IS LIKELY TO RAPE AGAIN, IF I DON'T STOP HIM!

But he never raped anyone.  He masturbated in front of them, after asking permission to do so.

HE IS A MAN.  HE WAS AN IMPORTANT COMEDIAN.  HE HAD POWER OVER THEM.  ABUSE OF POWER.  RAPE IS AN ABUSE OF POWER.  THUS, HE WAS A RAPIST, AND MUST SERVE A LONG JAIL SENTENCE!

Oh, I get it.  Thanks, evil spirit. Since he had to be on Twitter, and since no diversity of opinion is allowed on Twitter, he had to agree 100% with what Twitter was saying about him.  Why?  Because he likely internalized the concept that Twitter is always right.

YOU'RE WELCOME.  NOW, BEFORE I GO, I WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT WOMEN WHO ARE TERFS AREN'T WOMEN!

Wait, what?  But, under that logic, they would still be able to show bobs and vagine, no matter what they believe, so how aren't they women?

OH, YOU DOUBT MY PROWESS?  THEN BEHOLD!

::Greentshirtman has turned into greentshirtwoman::

Holy shit, I am physically female, now.  But I still say that Feminists, even radical ones who insist that feminism is for the primary benefit of those either born with vaginas, or intersexed genital, are female.  Their xx genes don't magically disappear after they believe the wrong thing, or refuse to watch the (excellent) film, Boys Don't Cry.  (Now available on VHS!)

> I believe that the ‚Äúbelieve all women‚Äù vision of feminism unintentionally fetishizes women. Women are no longer human and flawed. They are Truth personified. They are above reproach.

> I believe that it‚Äôs condescending to think that women and their claims can‚Äôt stand up to interrogation and can‚Äôt handle skepticism. I believe that facts serve feminists far better than faith. That due process is better than mob rule.

> Maybe it will happen tomorrow or maybe next week or maybe next month. But the Duke lacrosse moment, the Rolling Stone moment, will come. A woman‚Äôs accusation will turn out to be grossly exaggerated or flatly untrue. And if the governing principle of this movement is still an article of faith, many people will lose their religion. They will tear down all accusers as false prophets. And we will go back to a status quo in which the word of the Angelos is more sacred than the word of the Isabellas.

[...]

> From time immemorial, men have been allowed to just be people while women have had to be women. I thought feminism was supposed to liberate us from this flattening of our identity. It‚Äôs supposed to allow us to just be people, too.

> ‚ÄúTrust but verify‚Äù may not have the same ring as ‚Äúbelieve all women.‚Äù But it‚Äôs a far better policy.

Some things are dangerous to say. It's better to stay quiet and let yourself be heard only when it counts (aka in the voting booth) than to pipe up and face the consequences which all too often include physical assault and other harrassment."
3218,2020-05-03 16:07:20,gcraxh,"Kavanaugh didn‚Äôt do himself any favors with his response. 

But I think the more appropriate comparison is to trump. Look at both of their responses to allegations:

Biden acknowledges that he has done a lot of stuff to make women uncomfortable, apologizes for it, and says he will do better in the future. He says he wants a thorough investigation of the alleged assault. 

Trump never admits he has ever done anything wrong, and he usually calls the women who accuse him of sexual assault fat and ugly. He has never asked for an investigation into allegations. It‚Äôs the same old ‚Äúnobody respects women more than me. Nobody.‚Äù Schtick."
3219,2020-05-03 16:59:47,gcraxh,"Let‚Äôs be fair, though, Clinton > Trump is a 19 year difference, this Kavanaugh debacle happened less than two years ago."
3220,2020-05-03 18:47:10,gcraxh,"You should also recall that, well, Trump is a horrible president who is ruining the country, and Democrats were pretty desperate to find ways to hinder his progress toward that outcome, so they leapt on a chance that ended up not having a ton of evidence to support it.

If, say, Ted Cruz had nominated Kavanaugh, I don't think the reaction would have been as strong. He'd have just been another conservative justice pushed by a conservative president, not someone supported by a man with multiple sexual assault and rape accusations against him."
3221,2020-05-03 17:31:55,gcraxh,"With Kavanaugh the issue was the guy was new to the public eye and we wanted a chance to vet the claim before pushing through his nomination.

We did slow things down a bit. I did feel in the testimony that it wasn't beyond a reasonable doubt, so I was okay with Republicans approving him, even though I still object based on his demeanor during the investigation.

Biden has been vetted for years. The allegations also aren't beyond a reasonable doubt. And he's comporting himself better."
3222,2020-05-03 21:59:44,gcraxh,"Heres my non-partisan take on this:

I think a possible reasoning here is the old adage of ""those in glass houses should not throw rocks"". If Republicans began to unequivocally believe her, the media would immediately  throw it back as to say  ""why not automatically believe the Trump accusers as well then"" (who as many people have mentioned are more objectively credible). Republicans are aware the paradox and hypocrisy they would be putting themselves into here, and have realized that it is more beneficial for them to not re-hash the Trump scandals than it is to try and support Reade.

When it comes to democrats believing Ford and then not believing Reade its a matter of the timeline in which it occurred. If the Ford accusation occurred after the Reade accusation, I am confident democrats would not have ""automatically believed her"" for the same reasons as Republicans. However because Reade occurred after Ford, it is obviously preferable for democrats to ""be a hypocrite"" than it is for them to condemn their nominee for potentially being a sexual assaulter.

So at the end of the day both parties had a choice:

Republicans: put more pressure on Biden, but in turn get accused of being hypocritical, and to put the Trump allegations back into the spotlight OR to not unequivocally believe her and instead stand at a distance and call out democrats for being hypocritical. The choice is pretty clear

Democrats: Don't believe Reade at the expense of being called a hypocrite OR to believe her and negatively effect their nominee and chance at the presidency. The choice is pretty clear."
3223,2020-05-03 15:11:02,gcraxh,"Who cares about Ford. 

It seems pretty weak to me that the best argument some of the people on the right bring up is ""but look at how you treated Dr. Ford"".

Trump can't win by himself or his own merits. He needs some sort of controversy always surrounding his opponents. Very weak. Very sad."

3228,2020-05-03 17:02:18,gcraxh,I think it‚Äôs a good sign after how wholeheartedly they supported that Sulkowicz liar. Perhaps even an indicator of things moving towards a more rational cultural viewpoint.
3229,2020-05-03 15:22:33,gcraxh,"Yes, it is right to be critical, and I am (I think this accusation is sketchy as hell), but these same sources (and their allies) were strongly against being critical just a few years ago, while loudly damning anyone as sexist for supporting being critical."
3230,2020-05-03 15:45:40,gcraxh,"One has to think the peddling of stories like the UVA rape hoax, the Mattress Girl debacle at Columbia, and the whole Aziz Ansari thing contributed to such a warped viewpoint over the past decade."
3231,2020-05-03 15:45:49,gcraxh,"My understanding was that ‚Äúbelieve all women‚Äù was originally part of program for training police investigating sex crimes ‚Äî there was a tendency for police to treat those reporting sexual assault with an unreasonable amount of skepticism and to engage in victim blaming. So training began to emphasize that investigators should, when interviewing, to not cross-examine the victim ‚Äî assume the allegations are true, then try and corroborate them.

It wasn‚Äôt originally intended to be some sort of life philosophy. The feminist far-left jumped on it as a kind of hashtagable catch phrase, and then the right jumped on that, to make it seem that‚Äôs what everyone on the left believed."
3232,2020-05-03 17:18:04,gcraxh,"Joe Biden.

>	""For a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus, nationally, you've got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she's talking about is real,"" said Biden during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faced accusations that as a teenager he had assaulted a woman at a party."
3233,2020-05-03 17:10:32,gcraxh,"Actually the more news that comes out the better. I‚Äôm with Biden on this - full investigation and release any materials. The accuser‚Äôs story is inconsistent and changing constantly.

Which leads me to the three real differences I‚Äôve yet to hear conservatives acknowledge:

~~1) Fords story never changed, as Reade‚Äôs has been.~~ (edit: both Ford and Reade have changed their story as time progressed)

2) Biden welcoming a thorough investigation, while Kavanaugh got the severely hampered, you can‚Äôt question all the potential witnesses treatment. I won‚Äôt even mention Kav‚Äôs ‚Äúperformance‚Äù during the hearing.

3) Ford‚Äôs character as a witness remains unassailed, while Reade has history of fraud. Ford subjected herself to brutal questioning from conservatives in front of the whole nation. Her life will never be the same due. Reade has the chance to go on Fox, arguably the most friendly MSM outlet for her, and bails.

4) The dozen accusations against President Trump. At least one of which had accusers withdraw the lawsuits after a litany of death threats against them. 

Posts like this are attempting to keep the focus on the ‚Äúbelieve all women‚Äù and ‚Äúbelieve women‚Äù distinction in an attempt to change the narrative to focus on perceived hypocrisy from the left, but actual context matters. Nuance is a thing which, it seems, conservatives aren‚Äôt able to apply to the MeToo movement, nor other areas, such as the justification of government intersection in the economy.

Edit: apparently I am incorrect on the first point. Leaving it but striking out as I no longer stand by it. The remaining however, do."
3234,2020-05-04 05:11:02,gcraxh,">Kavanaugh didn‚Äôt do himself any favors with his response.

I think that's mainly in the eye of the beholder. Those who wanted him out went out and said ""look at his anger and frustration! That's proof he's a privileged white man who was just caught!"". People more on his side saw a man undergoing a witch hunt that threatened to not only deprive him of the post he was nominated for, but all the respect and reputation he acquired through decades of his career, without any possibility to either avoid testifying or of making any testimony that his lynchers would accept as genuine and not suggestive of his guilt.

Someone innocent in that position would be entirely right to be angry and emotional. Anybody who's ever been falsely accused of something in their life would find that very typical of someone who's falsely accused of something serious."
3235,2020-05-04 15:16:26,gcraxh,His response? Being angry at being falsely accused of rape deserves an angry response.
3236,2020-05-03 22:02:41,gcraxh,"\> Biden acknowledges that he has done a lot of stuff to make women

If you want to call this an apology:

>In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, I have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort,‚Äù Biden said in a statement Sunday. ‚ÄúAnd not once ‚Äî never ‚Äî did I believe I acted inappropriately.

It is very telling how Joe Biden seems to believe that what matters is how HE saw the situation, not on how the women experienced it. I think you could call this narcissism.

\> and says he will do better in the future.

For this I found no source but maybe you can do better."
3237,2020-05-03 16:57:12,gcraxh,">But I think the more appropriate comparison is to trump. Look at both of their responses to allegations:

Look at the responses of everyone else.  Trump is assumed guilty and immediately called for a criminal investigation into the allegations, just like Kavanaugh.  Biden gets a couple months of supporters calling for him to make a statement and then gets assumed innocent.

&#x200B;

Edit:

And just to cut things off the the pass, yes, the accusations against Trump are clearly more severe and, in my opinion, credible.  Which is why Trump actually makes a terrible comparison, Reade/Biden is far more like Ford/Kavanaugh, except people keep trying to stick to the Trump comparison despite the huge differences between the two."

Ford's best friend and father publicly stated they didnt believe her.


As long as journalists like tapper is calling out Democrats on their hypocrisy on national tv, this will always be a story."
3253,2020-05-04 15:30:39,gcraxh,"Problem with Kavanaugh compared to this allegation was that Kavanaugh had a series of missteps which led people to question his credibility. There's 4 things I can think of that made the Kavanaugh situation worse for Kavanaugh vs Biden. 

* Ford went through the Senate office first privately to report on this trying not to bring any attention to herself.  The Intercept took that away from her.

* Ford had documents that showed she did talk about this prior to Kavanaugh being hoisted into the spot light.  Reade does not have anything written down.

* This is the biggest--Kavanaugh's Fox News interview was full of lies.  He claimed he never drank underage, he had to go back and correct this during his testimony.  He claimed he didn't know what boofing was, he had to go back and correct this during his testimony.  He claimed that a Devil's Triangle was a drinking game, the common use of that phrase is for men in a threesome with another male and woman.   This is what led most voices to be against Kavanaugh.  It was his own interview with his wife, where he openly lied and then had to recant before the Senate hearing.  Amy Klobachar and Durbin were the only 2 who were smart enough to realize those lies were legitimate concerns. 

* Lastly his reaction to all of this initially. Conservatives ate it up, some moderates did too, but many moderates and many on the left felt the bringing up of the Clintons was a major issue. 

So the comparison here is that Ford tried to do things in a manner that did not make her seem like she was out for fame, or tried to get a result overturned she did not like.  She had an issue with Kavanaugh as a person, not because of his issues.   Kavanaugh also did not help himself with that Fox News interview which took a lot of his credibility away when he had to go back for the hearing and recant what he said with his wife 2 days prior. 

Now compare that to Reade--who's originally was telling a different story last year.  Then she goes through channels that aren't neutral at all.  She went to Halper, Grim, and McHugh all of whom you could argue have an active interest *against* Biden. Then Nathan from Current Affairs begins to tell her brother how to respond to the media, and Grim leaps to retweet and comment on a Biden accusation that turned out to be false.  Later he had to delete the tweet and explain why, but the question is why didn't he look into it first. The answer is the people latching onto Reade are clearly trying to push Biden out by any means regardless of Reade.

Now we go to Reade herself.  The journalists Grim and McHugh both said her story was consistent in that the complaint was not about the assault.  But in the days after her Halper interview she said that the complaint did have assault within it and it would be in the Archives.  That turned out to be false.  Reade never readdresses this, and the journalists who have been promoting this said her new claim that the complaint does not have any assault claims within it is consistent with their reporting, but when she made the public tweet that went against that reporting neither Grim nor McHugh tweeted saying this is inconsistent with what you told me. 

Reade's witnesses, all spare 1, were contacted by Reade first asking to come forward.  Now a few of her witnesses are claiming they're not sure what they remember about the claim.  Again Reade doesn't address this, and neither do the two investigative journalists helping her. 

There's a lot of inconsistencies here that Ford did not have.  Couple that with Biden's claims thus far that it did not happen hasn't been inconsistent and he did not give an interview where it was clear he was lying about small things. What is consistent here is that we're watching this claim breakdown and it looks like Reade's claim from 2019 is much more correct than the new assault claim. That 2019 claim is consistent with her witnesses, her mom's call, and her brother's original memory.  Furthermore Reade has gone to great lengths to delete and remove any evidence of that claim, and she's changed her own original blog post to reflect the assault claim now."
3254,2020-05-04 17:01:40,gcraxh,"Amazing. The left often decries the concept of ""toxic masculinity,"" a large part of which includes men not showing their emotions and bottling them up inside.

At the same time, a man who was falsely accused of rape on the national stage, in front of his family, smeared throughout liberal media as a rapist without any evidence, is lambasted by lefties for getting tearful and angry during the proceedings.

Her story:
>‚ÄúHe just had me up against the wall, and the wall was cold. And I remember, he‚Äî it happened all at once. The gym bag, I don‚Äôt know where it went, I handed it to him, it was gone, and then his hands were on me, and underneath my clothes,‚Äù Reade said. ‚ÄúHe went down my skirt, but then up inside it, and he penetrated me with his fingers.‚Äù

She seems to have a history of playing a victim or painting her life as one of woe.  Here is her description [of her father's physical and mental abuse in an article she wrote accusing Joe Biden](https://medium.com/@AlexandraTaraReade/powerful-men-and-the-women-they-choose-to-destroy-2f471fa1b2b2)
>The first powerful man who abused me physically and emotionally was my father. **He was rich and a defense contractor but did not like children, only the process of getting them. He never shared his wealth with any of his children or family but squandered it on women he met and his own indulgences like the modern day pirate he was.** But oh, how everyone wanted his attention and approval, even other men. My father was charismatic, funny and interesting but he had a very cruel streak with business associates and family alike. He died alone and broke. ‚ÄúKarma!‚Äù one of my relatives said. I don‚Äôt know, perhaps. But what I would have given for just an ounce of love he never gave anyone. However, I had a dynamic, creative, intelligent mother, **wonderful brothers and cousins** that more than made up for this vacant place he left in my heart.

vs [her father's obituary](https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/wausaudailyherald/obituary.aspx?n=robert-moulton&pid=177929024)
>Mr. Moulton leaves many friends throughout the United States **after a successful career in journalism and as public relations manager of Honeywell Corporation in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He was the author of several books**, his first, ""First to Fly,"" a non-fiction account of animals journeying into outer space as well as subsequent fictional books relating to farm life in Wisconsin and a memoir, entitled, ""Loss,"" as he grieved for a lost love. 

>He is survived by his children, **Kimberly**, **Diane**, *Collin* Reade **and Tara**.

also kinda weird she forgot she only has one brother and two sisters.  And her father did have a second wife, after his first wife died.  Meaning Tara actually would have had a step-mother when her father died and not her biological mother.

She's changed her story for leaving DC 3 times - first it was because she got offered to work on a governor's race in california but her abusive husband forced her to move to the midwest so he could work on a congressional campaign, then it was because she grew disillusioned with American imperialism and ""xenophobia"" against Russia, then it was because Joe Biden assaulted her.

And at first she left of her own free will, but then the story became Biden fired her.  In the piece ""describing"" her father I linked above she ""describes"", in detail, driving to DC when she gets the job [but in this post where she describes her domestic abuse, she describes, in detail, arriving to DC by plane to work for Biden.](https://archive.li/QpjbO#selection-3763.0-3763.326).

>As the plane descended into Washington D. C., my Siamese cat, Cleo, meowed loudly from under my seat. Cleo had been through all my many moves, men, and a couple of Los Angeles earthquakes. As the lights of Washington D.C. reflected through the plane‚Äôs windows, the excitement of my new job as a Senate staffer lay ahead of me.

It was considered the safe place for parents to send their young women who were interning and working as staff on the hill. We ate in a common dining hall, had gym locker type bathroom/showers and no men were allowed upstairs after 8 p.m. It was secure and safe. Little did the parents know who unwittingly sent their young college grads here that the real predators were some of the members of the House and Senate.

The alternative interpretation is that she went through Senate Democrats to better coordinate a political assassination of a Republican nominee. ""Leaks"" of information to the media of that kind rarely come from some faceless intern and are far more frequently greenlit by the top.

She also was able to leverage the publicity later on to crowd-raise a cool 600 000$. The claims she subjected herself to major negative consequences for making her accusation always make me laugh. She lives in a massively liberal region, working at a massively liberal university. It is a taboo in these places to doubt a woman making accusations and anything that would hurt Trump would be applauded. She risked nothing at all by making such accusations. Professionally, socially and financially, she stood to benefit from them, and she did.

> Ford had documents that showed she did talk about this prior to  Kavanaugh being hoisted into the spot light.  Reade does not have  anything written down. 

Nothing in her therapist's notes could ascertain Kavanaugh's identity. In fact, some have pointed out that the notes seem to refer to an even that happened a few years later, when Kavanaugh had gone off to Yale.

> This is the biggest--Kavanaugh's Fox News interview was full of lies.   He claimed he never drank underage, he had to go back and correct this  during his testimony.  He claimed he didn't know what boofing was, he  had to go back and correct this during his testimony.  He claimed that a  Devil's Triangle was a drinking game, the common use of that phrase is  for men in a threesome with another male and woman.   This is what led  most voices to be against Kavanaugh.  It was his own interview with his  wife, where he openly lied and then had to recant before the Senate  hearing.  Amy Klobachar and Durbin were the only 2 who were smart enough  to realize those lies were legitimate concerns. 

[Kavanaugh never claimed he never drank underage](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/24/us/transcript-of-brett-kavanaughs-interview-with-fox-news.html). You are making an obvious mischaracterization of what he said, I don't know if this is willful on your part of you're simply repeating what dishonest sources have told you, but your claim is false, obviously so. Kavanaugh never denied he went to parties where there was drinking involved when he was in high school. He denied ever drinking so much he blacked out and forgot what he was doing the night before when he was in high school.

These were not at all legitimate concerns at all, they were clearly grasping at straws. High school boys, especially prior to the internet, could very well use their own slang between each other that wouldn't conform to the most sexually charged version of them, and Kavanaugh's friends at the time confirmed his uses of the expressions as accurate.

> Lastly his reaction to all of this initially. Conservatives ate it up,  some moderates did too, but many moderates and many on the left felt the  bringing up of the Clintons was a major issue. 

This seems most like a witch hunt... ""Denying the charges? That means you are guilty!"". What reaction should he have had then? Let's face it, any reaction he would have adopted could be spinned into being a ""bad reaction that suggests his guilt"".

As to Reade and Biden, I won't focus on the details. Like I gave Kavanaugh the benefit of the doubt, I'll also give Biden the same courtesy... but there is no denying the massive hypocrisy from progressives and the Democratic Party, who were willing to destroy a man's reputation and career over an accusation of unwanted sexual contact when he would have been a minor that had no evidence, that the accuser herself couldn't tell when it happened, nor name anybody else present at this supposed ""party"" that could remember it. But now that a similarly unproven accusation has been made against their presumptive nominee for the presidential election, they dismiss it out of hand."
3272,2020-05-04 17:42:36,gcraxh,"Everyone who isn‚Äôt clinically stupid knows the game that was being played. I cannot believe that the Dems had any interest in facts, I think they simply wanted to smear Kavanagh and potentially stop him getting nominated. Who honestly just says ‚ÄúI believe you‚Äù in those circumstances? She alleged an event 30 years ago, against a man with no history of similar allegations (take note Biden defenders), at the exact moment that the Dems needed the guy to be damaged. 

Of course now it‚Äôs Biden the principles of presumed innocence and fair trial and common courtesies (like not being defamed across all media for weeks) suddenly matter.

That has absolutely nothing to do with the allegation though.  So what if Kavanaugh didn't act as you wanted him to act, that may factor into your opinion on his worthiness as a Supreme Court judge but it has absolutely zero bearing on whether the sexual assault happened or not.  People you don't like and don't act how you want them to act aren't instantly criminals, nor should their behavior be used to judge them unless there is a connection to the crime.

That even adds to the hypocrisy here.  You feel Kavanaugh reacted poorly to the accusation but that was almost entirely brought out in the senate hearing.  Had he never been forced to go through that line of questioning, you'd never have seen that side of him.  How do you know Biden wouldn't similarly react in such a fashion?  As far as I'm aware Biden has never had to stand in front of the senate under oath in front of people who believe he's at least possibly guilty of sexual assault that he believes he didn't commit for what appears to be a political shit show all while having to justify his every movement as a teenager after a couple months of him and his family facing national news accusing him of the crime his family facing harassment and death threats.  Let Biden stand up in that situation and see if he does better.  Not that it would matter how he reacts, because just like Kavanaugh it has no bearing on whether he did it or not.

> But does that mean trump just continues getting a free pass?  That seems to be the implication.

Why does Trump matter in this case?  Does the fact that Trump isn't answering for his potential crimes mean Biden, or any democart, can freely not answer to any of theirs?

> What do all the people screaming ‚Äòhypocrisy‚Äô want to happen from here on out? 

For me personally it's simple recognition that the problem exists.  There isn't anything really wrong with owning up to your own hypocrisy.  The fact that you, and others, keep trying to call out Trump's problems is just an attempt to justify the hypocrisy as a non-issue.  I personally don't think Ford had or Reade has any merit to their claims at the moment so I don't particularly care that Kavanaugh got off, although it's hilarious that Democrat's just take a blind view to the damage he and his family suffered (apparently public threats and humiliation only matter in some cases), and I won't care when Biden skates through this.  

I didn't vote for Trump and I'd be happy to see him answer for the accusations against him but then again I remember Clinton so I didn't expect anything to come for Trump either."

She has her brother, who changed his story twice.  He initially told ABC that he first heard of the sexual assault claim a few months ago, and when he first interviewed with WaPo said he remembered her telling him about the neck touching/backrub.  Then several days later texted them that she told him she was raped.  Totally credible.  Dude remembered the most mild parts of the accusation but forget the part about her being raped?   Give me a break

Her neighbor said that she had forgotten about the conversation until Reade contacted her.  Both her brother and neighbor just happened to forget that Reade told them how she was raped?  More likely is that someone with a history of lying, theft, and fraud told them a more mild story (like her first version of events) and then distorted the truth in her 'reminder'.  Her neighbor even said she found Biden believable

> a recording of her mom talking about it happening,

This is incredibly disingenuous.  She has a recording of her mom talking about how much Reade respects Biden.  In what world would a mom talk about how much her daughter respects her rapist? If anything, this is evidence that Biden didnt sexually assault her

3318,2020-05-03 20:06:22,gcraxh,"Its the title IX changes. That basically trample a defendants rights and due process.

>TITLE IX SEXUAL ASSAULT HEARINGS

>The next step in the school‚Äôs investigative process usually is a school administrative hearing into the matter, which also can present significant challenges for the accused.

>The school will use a lower standard of proof than criminal courts. Most school hearings under Title IX ask for proof that the crime did not occur, which is the opposite of criminal cases where prosecutors bear the burden of proving a criminal case beyond a reasonable doubt.

>Attorneys are often not allowed to speak at hearings, and investigators often fail to address favorable evidence the accused presents.

>A school will generally turn over the sexual assault investigation to law enforcement if the information is subpoenaed. All of this puts the person facing school rape accusations in a difficult position.

>The criminal defense bar recently scrutinized Title IX investigations due to the lack of due process. The Trump administration believes the 2011 ‚ÄúDear Colleague Letter‚Äù from the Obama administration substantially lowered the burden of proof required for college administrators to determine whether alleged sexual misconduct occurred on campus.
The letter states: ‚ÄúConduct may constitute unlawful sexual harassment under Title IX even if the police do not have sufficient evidence of a criminal violation.‚Äù This means college administrators, and not judges and juries, hold the power to decide the fate of an alleged perpetrator. As a result, universities are expelling students based on inadequate investigations and the careless attitudes of school administrators.

Basically anyone can accuse anyone, and even with overwhelming evidence of the contrary, a school can and rule against the accused and destroy their lives. 

Mainly it involves hookups, sometimes sex never happens, the women gets pissed off thinking she is owed something, friendship, girlfriend status whatever and then claims to the college she was raped or sexually assaulted. 

The college does an investigation the accuser is likely lawyered up, the accused walks into these hearings denied legal aid, denied the right to submit evidence, while the accuser side gets to cross examine basically the accused. 

There are many high profile cases where people have actually fought this after the fact but it mainly comes from people who already have family money to try and clear their name. What we don't know is how many were railroaded in these Kangaroo courts with no means to clear their name, forever branded a rapist in their community. Even if law enforcement ruled it was all full of shit and had no evidence. That's just Billy who raped a girl in college and got away with it. I mean he was expelled and his life ruined but he should be thankful he isnt in prison. 

And that is what the title IX changes have done on college campuses. 

One of the most famous cases is mattress girl. She had write ups and support from places like the NYT. He got some justice but not much. Mattress girl continues to be proud of what she did, it was basically her senior thesis project to falsely accuse someone and ruin their life. Dont worry she was punished, she is a feminist icon and enjoys a lucrative career in performance art still peddling the fame of carrying around a mattress."

He's one of the most powerful people in the country. Folks wanted to understand who he was, and their first impression was mostly defined by the accusation.

The media talked about him a whole bunch, elements of the media did what they always do by exaggerating outrage for the sake of ratings, and there was a hearing where the guy acted like a thin-skinned entitled ass, but there wasn't enough evidence to persuade me an assault actually happened.

I was persuaded I don't want Kavanaugh because I didn't like how he handled the situation, and I acknowledge that many people took too black-and-white a view of the situation, but in the end there wasn't enough evidence.

By contrast, the first impression of Biden was decades ago, and he was veep for 8 years.

I wouldn't be surprised if throughout the whole of the US higher education system, some people got falsely accused, and some institutions punished them without merit. But I'm confident that a LOT of sexual abuse in the past has been ignored.

So, while we want to make sure schools avoid unjustly punishing people in order to get to a more perfect outcome, I think it's a clear net positive to have the government push for schools to take their responsibility to the victims of sexual abuse more seriously."

I can believe Tara Reade honestly believes she was sexually assaulted, I can believe she believes it was Joe Biden. I can also believe that Joe Biden didn't do it.

It's also strange we're comparing a presidential candidate and a judge, as opposed to a presidential candidate and a president.

Also, y'know, being woke and enlightened is what we should be aiming for. Being aware of problems in society and caring about fixing them is a good thing. That goes for recognizing the negative consequences of your solutions, to try to find the best answer.

It's weird. Like, advocates for victims say, ""Let's make reforms!""

Then a bunch of people come out saying, ""Look, your reforms had some negative side effects! You were bad and wrong to want those reforms, and I think you're clearly villains!""

I never hear victim advocates say, ""No! The system is flawless!"" But opponents of these reforms act like victim advocates are completely blind to the risk of false accusations.

It disheartens me to hear nuance free claims from critics of these policies. If I saw more contextualization (e.g., ""It's good that people are taking these claims more seriously, but I think we could make a few changes to avoid false accusations leading to punishment, and my proposal is X.""), it'd do a lot more to convince me that people were working in good faith to find good solutions, rather than just trying to score points for their 'side.'"

Agreed.  Some media companies are trying to gaslight us into thinking they gave Kavanaugh fair treatment.  Believe women was used just as the dictionary defines the word believe.

Definition

Generally, sexual assault is defined as unwanted sexual contact.[4]¬†The National Center for Victims of Crime states:[5]

Sexual assault takes many forms including attacks such as rape or attempted rape, as well as any unwanted sexual contact or threats. Usually a sexual assault occurs when someone touches any part of another person's body in a sexual way, even through clothes, without that person's consent."
3392,2020-05-03 22:25:04,gcraxh,"What is hilary doing now?  Thats right,  she is working hard to try to stay relevant."
3393,2020-05-03 21:57:15,gcraxh,"Because they have every reason to release any evidence that looks bad to biden.  They were caught because a journalist identified the workers in Maryland,  not by biden releasing any information before they were caught."
3394,2020-05-03 21:58:20,gcraxh,"Biden told the nation there is no way any document could exist in his files, but still sends people to look secretly.  That doesnt look fishy at all."

You keep twisting his words and his actions. Keep trying though. Eventually you'll convince someone."
3400,2020-05-03 17:53:13,gcraxh,So 99% of the people. Alright.
3401,2020-05-03 23:36:19,gcraxh,I did.  Just want you to notice that it fits atleast 2 out of the 3 criteria for sexual assult. Only missing his motive.
3402,2020-05-03 22:38:41,gcraxh,That would be hilarious.  She always did need a man for her success. And i guess she is keeping the tradition of that man being accused of sexual assult.  She must have a type and pushed it on Huma as well.

Usually a sexual assault occurs when someone touches any part of another person's body in a sexual way, even through clothes, without that person's consent.


He touched that child without any consent.  If he gets sexual gratification from the power he gets from touching women without permission then thats sexual assault."
3409,2020-05-03 17:57:28,gcraxh,"Sure, you're welcome to believe that."
3410,2020-05-03 23:39:36,gcraxh,"I do agree that it was inappropriate, I just have a hard time believing Biden did this out of some sexual proclivity he might have."

3412,2020-05-03 23:40:12,gcraxh,Men dont ever get sexual gratification from holding power over women.

3415,2020-05-03 17:59:09,gcraxh,Please. Tell me what my media consumption is.
3416,2020-05-03 23:41:13,gcraxh,"As I said before, it fills all the requirements except motive."
3417,2020-05-03 18:00:48,gcraxh,"Pretty clearly, you subscribe to media sources that like describing the party as the ""Democrat Party"" instead of the ""Democratic Party"", so sources like Rush Limbaugh and Fox News."
3418,2020-05-03 23:43:28,gcraxh,"Good thing you're not a detective. Now I won't deny Biden has a history of troubling behavior, but there's no evidence to suggest he's a rapist or sexual abuser. And this Tara Reade case doesn't hold water, if we're being honest. But you keep doing what you're gonna do."
3419,2020-05-03 18:01:45,gcraxh,"I don‚Äôt watch Rush Limbaugh or Fox News. Would you like another guess? 

Do democrats who use the word the same way I do watch Rush Limbaugh/Fox News?"
3420,2020-05-03 23:44:37,gcraxh,Keep defending a guy who puts his hand on minor girls chest and doesnt think that is anything more than troubling.  It would be sick if it wasnt such a long running thing that the liberal media makes jokes out of it.

I've love to see a Democrat consistently describe his or her own party as the ""Democrat Party"", not the ""Democratic Party"" - feel free to post evidence of that if you have it."
3422,2020-05-04 01:23:30,gcraxh,Lol okay.
3423,2020-05-03 18:05:12,gcraxh,"Yea. You can‚Äôt play the game because its a dumb game you shouldn‚Äôt have tried in the first place. Young conservatives don‚Äôt care for Fox News. 

Right. Let me go to r/politics and get that for you. You‚Äôve lost this issue. No one cares."
3424,2020-05-03 18:05:58,gcraxh,"Heh, it's pretty amusing you think that your declarations matter."
3425,2020-05-03 18:06:17,gcraxh,Have a good day bud.
3426,2020-05-03 18:06:44,gcraxh,"Same to you, friendo."

So there are two large differences between Reade's and Ford's situation. One of the alleged perpetrators is running for public office versus being appointed to it. A federal judge, for all its allure and splendor, isn't really a very public position. Like did you know Kavanaugh's name before Trump floated him to fill Kennedy's seat? I sure didn't. In addition, a federal judge and a supreme court judge at a federal level are appointed positions. Ford could have come out if, for example, Kavanaugh was running for State Supreme court or something where she lived. Generally those spots tend to be elected and the candidate has to hold up to more public scrutiny. [Ford even expressed this concern to her therapist in 2012.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/california-professor-writer-of-confidential-brett-kavanaugh-letter-speaks-out-about-her-allegation-of-sexual-assault/2018/09/16/46982194-b846-11e8-94eb-3bd52dfe917b_story.html) So when Kavanaugh was chosen for the bench she felt that she had no choice but to raise concerns about him during what was essentially his job interview. Honestly, I think Kavanaugh did more to undermine his own credibility than Ford did.  

Meanwhile Biden for the last 40+ years has been in the public spotlight in some way shape or form. He's been running for reelection for Senate, ran for president now on his third try, and was VP for 8 years. At best what we have about Biden is that he very much flirted with the line of sexual harassment by being a creepy hugging, sniffing, guy that likes to give unwanted shoulder rubs. 

Another thing is that with the timing issue you have to take the credibility and pattern issues into account too. They walk hand in hand with a lot of the timing. [Ford's credibility is bolstered by other women coming forward with their encounters with Kavanaugh.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/us/politics/brett-kavanaugh-accusers-women.html) Reade's claim so far leaves her on an island. Ford's credibility is also bolstered that she has receipts for who she talked to remembering the incident. Reade's sort of shifts depends on who she talks to, even the neighbor that confirmed the story [is not sure who to believe in this case.](https://www.democracynow.org/2020/5/1/lynda_lacasse_tara_reade_joe_biden)"

2. In 2016 Kansas had a Repub Caucus that had ~75k people turnout. There was no Repub primary in 2020 and I'm guessing some of those people voted in the Dem primary.

Now I fully support the move to both primaries and vote by mail. But there are several key differences between 2016 and 2020 we should be mindful of when making comparisons."

There's a lot of video proof of Biden fondling, groping, sniffing, etc women. Sometimes children. Unfortunately, this will sink his campaign. People don't care too much about what they can't see. Trump's accusers are certainly credible, as are many of Joe's, but at the end of the day you're betting on people caring about the Access Hollywood tape (which we know they don't) more than the dozens and dozens of documented examples of Joe feeling up kids!

This is a losing strategy, guaranteed. I'm not USian, though I do work there for months at a time, so I don't particularly care which rapist people vote for. The first presidential admin Biden was a part of oversaw the development of concentration camps for Latin American minors. The same admin increased extra judicial murder of civilians by drone strikes as well. These aren't good people, they're just more civil about murdering brown people."

How do you explain Obama winning 57% of the vote in the Oklahoma primary in 2012?"

These are states that will most likely go to Trump, which is why I'm confused by dems thinking Biden winning these states is anything more than symbolic.

Edit - I totally missed MO, Wyo. and Ark. too as red states that Biden won ≈∫ but for what? I mean, nearly half the states that have primaried are going to go for Trump. I'd live to be wrong, but that chunk of Dem voters doesn't represent the nation as a whole (obviously)."

Voter turn out was not historic or high across the board this year.

Is no one concerned that red state democratic support is simply symbolic, and won't translate to actual flips come November?

3632,2020-05-03 15:10:22,gcr7zq,A lot of Bernie people are still voting Bernie to get him more delegates to try and push the party left at the convention. This was to be expected.

3663,2020-05-03 16:23:31,gcr7zq,"Yeah, it's fuckin' Biden's fault that Bernie wasn't competitive long enough to last until Kansas got a chance to vote.  Fuckin' vote-getting Biden, screw that guy and his larger base of people who actually vote."

Blame the people who set the date of theor primary. Blame Kansas. Or blame Bernie for not performing as well as Biden and having dropped out.  Funny you don't see Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Booker, Warren, or any other candidate's supporters whining about disenfranchisement because theor guy lost."
3666,2020-05-03 19:15:13,gcr7zq,I know it‚Äôs terrible. The other one is president.

3672,2020-05-03 17:21:26,gcr7zq,Establishment or moderate Dems would rather try to win centre-right votes than appeal to the progressive left. This primary season has made that extremely clear.
3673,2020-05-03 19:38:38,gcr7zq,"I'm guessing they voted by mail before Biden was the only one left... and as their pick wasnt applicable anymore, their votes were voided....

Or something like that?"
3674,2020-05-03 15:06:29,gcr7zq,Fun fact: Obama only won 57% of the vote in the 2012 Oklahoma primary.
3675,2020-05-03 15:24:17,gcr7zq,"Just because people drop out doesn't mean their name gets scrubbed from the ballots. The campaigns likely applied for ballot access some time ago. Once you're on there it's hard to get taken off. If I'm not mistaken, Pete Buttigieg was on the Ohio ballot despite doing out of the race for some time. 

The 77% thing is to be expected. Bernie, while he has suspended his campaign, is still pushing for people to vote for him to get delegates to leverage the DNC to shift left at the convention. Also, Bernie did quite well in Kansas in 2016, so it is to be expected a lot of die hard Bernie supporters voted."
3676,2020-05-03 15:09:47,gcr7zq,"It was ranked choice, so this is a good sign."
3677,2020-05-03 16:04:24,gcr7zq,"No he wasn't. Bernie, Warren, and Gabbard (there was one other one I forget) were all on the ballot."
3678,2020-05-03 20:19:38,gcr7zq,"Well, voting by mail had begun on March 30th and Bernie didn't drop out until April 8th... So, one would hope Bernie was on the ballot. It would definitely raise some flags if they didn't have Bernie on the ballot"
3679,2020-05-03 21:06:48,gcr7zq,"Sanders was on the Ticket. He was officially still in the race until April 8, ballots went out March 30"
3680,2020-05-03 20:59:05,gcr7zq,yes.
3681,2020-05-04 04:39:33,gcr7zq,"I have no idea. From what I can see, apparently it's because there were still other people on the ballot and voting started at the end of March... but I mean, this race was over weeks before *that*. This feels like weird political tribalists trying to rally the team over nothing special."
3682,2020-05-03 16:12:35,gcr7zq,"Then you haven't been paying attention to shit. Trump and Biden both have extensive histories of making fucked up decisions that cost people their freedom or their lives.

3683,2020-05-03 16:47:12,gcr7zq,Go tell that to my dead countrymen.
3684,2020-05-04 01:20:26,gcr7zq,"Bernie is still running, he just suspended his campaign, Bernie never dropped out."

3688,2020-05-03 20:13:42,gcr7zq,Bernie is still on the ballot. He just suspended active campaigning. The rationale is to leverage his earned delegation at the DNC convention in setting the democratic platform.
3689,2020-05-03 20:14:58,gcr7zq,Bernie was still on the ballot.
3690,2020-05-03 21:48:34,gcr7zq,"So tell me, where did the other 23% go if he had no opponents of the ballot?"
3691,2020-05-03 21:03:31,gcr7zq,Oh please.  The same Serbs crying about NATO were the very ones perpetrating genocide of Bosniaks and Croats.   The same Serbs who ran concentration camps where soldiers ended up emptying ammo on the prisoners.

3704,2020-05-03 18:42:57,gcr7zq,"Considering Washington State has had vote-by-mail for a number of years now, I'd be curious to see stats on turnout from before/after over several years. Obviously you'd need to adjust for population growth over time, but still."
3705,2020-05-03 18:51:38,gcr7zq,"Not to subtract from the importance of VBM at all, but the 2016 KS primary was a caucus, which typically has lower turnout regardless."
3706,2020-05-03 19:57:12,gcr7zq,PA added it for this year pre corona. It's definitely going to make things more interesting.
3707,2020-05-03 21:55:53,gcr7zq,Now if we could only make it vote by mail AND ranked choice.
3708,2020-05-03 22:34:07,gcr7zq,Absolutely not. Wait until craziness happens and people start hijacking mail trucks. Unless they have a way to duplicate the vote that gets sent in digital format.
3709,2020-05-04 00:14:20,gcr7zq,Mail works for census. Since they don‚Äôt like some people to be counted they should set up census places where you have to go to get counted.
3710,2020-05-03 20:20:47,gcr7zq,"Well there you go. Certainly that has to account for the lion's share of the difference, then.

That makes me curious to check out stats for Colorado, where I live. We did caucases in 2016 and switched to a regular primary this year.

Edit: 123k vs 960k cycle to cycle."
3711,2020-05-03 20:51:34,gcr7zq,"You only got an automatic mail-in ballot if you were registered as a democrat. We also got our ballots right after Bernie dropped out. We were urged to still mail them back to show strong turnout, but I suspect a lot of people just tossed theirs because presidential nominee was the only thing on the ballot."
3712,2020-05-03 23:06:37,gcr7zq,That was about switching really quickly for an imminent election. States can go through the normal process of legislation to go vote-by-mail. Other states have been doing it already for years.
3713,2020-05-04 00:50:49,gcr7zq,"I wouldn't say that - in a way, I'd say they're *more* democratic (small D), as the idea is people get together and hash out their ideas/differences in person. 

But not everybody wants to take a few hours one afternoon/evening and go argue with strangers. Not everyone *can* \- there's all sorts of reasons folks who'd like to go can't manage it (or simply don't want to enough to find a way).

Democracy isn't just ""voting"", IMHO."
3714,2020-05-04 04:10:46,gcr7zq,"That was for the Senate and other races. The presidential vote, individually, was a primary this time."

3717,2020-05-03 17:11:32,gcr7zq,In my state we already let people older than 65 vote by mail. Apparently voter fraud is a non issue as soon as you're in a demographic that tends to vote Republican.
3718,2020-05-03 18:21:27,gcr7zq,"I think there‚Äôs a lot of fraud in American elections, across the board.  I think it‚Äôs most prevalent in places with electronic voting machines where vote totals can and probably are changed easily by changing computerized totals.  

I don‚Äôt think that voting by mail meaningfully changes that, up or down, but perhaps because there‚Äôs less to oversee, people could focus on preventing fraud more with vote by mail.  

I certainly support vote by mail and think it‚Äôs vital to our election this year."
3719,2020-05-03 19:03:33,gcr7zq,Remind him about NC election and  who did the most voting fraud last year.
3720,2020-05-03 21:54:36,gcr7zq,"Step 1: Claim method of voting is cheating.
Step 2: Make your opponents defend method, decry accusations of cheating.
Step 3: Cheat, win.

Trump is going to win in November because he's going to cheat. He's telling everyone that now. He always accuses his opponents of what his plans are."
3721,2020-05-03 16:41:05,gcr7zq,Ask him how they would ever be able to prove it?  How could you prove it through an electronic system?  Which would be easier to hide?
3722,2020-05-03 19:24:15,gcr7zq,It amazes me how fast these people come to believe shit like this.
3723,2020-05-03 19:49:18,gcr7zq,"Setting the table for what the excuses will be huh? They say Trump won‚Äôt go quietly, this could be what he‚Äôll wail about."

3725,2020-05-03 21:16:08,gcr7zq,Ask him if by fraud he means any votes cast for the Democrats.
3726,2020-05-04 02:34:36,gcr7zq,"I‚Äôm not against mail in ballots, but to think it won‚Äôt have negative consequences is naive. It will eliminate the secret ballot of a huge swath of the population. Anecdotally, my friend doesn‚Äôt give a shit about politics. She‚Äôs never voted. Her husband is a political junkie. He plans on filling out her mail in ballot and having her sign it, and she‚Äôs agreed to it because she honestly doesn‚Äôt give a shit. My friend is a dem so that will be a vote for Biden, but that shit still makes me incredibly uncomfortable.
 Now think of people in abusive relationships, or young voters whose parents will force them to vote a certain way. The elimination of the secret ballot is no joke and in my opinion should only be a temporary measure."
3727,2020-05-04 07:44:36,gcr7zq,"Funny. We do vote by mail in Ohio and the instance we had an issue was in 2004 with the machine tallies.

3729,2020-05-03 19:35:07,gcr7zq,What about how many don't vote due to the rapid change on voting method?
3730,2020-05-03 17:16:39,gcr7zq,I‚Äôve voted by mail for years and it seems to work fine.  But the thing you have to be vigilant about is ballot harvesting which CA just legalized.
3731,2020-05-03 17:34:57,gcr7zq,I personally prefer in-person voting because it prevents voter intimidation.
3732,2020-05-03 16:30:23,gcr7zq,Lifelong Democrat and in California they didn't even count mail in ballots. The DNC is absolutely corrupt and I don't trust them after 20 years of voting D only.

Biden was not the only viable candidate then."
3735,2020-05-03 17:53:10,gcr7zq,"lol at this talking point.

There is literally no outcome that you guys won‚Äôt use to further your narrative.

If it wasn‚Äôt so sad the desperation would be hilarious."
3736,2020-05-03 18:11:18,gcr7zq,"I was surprised as well as it seemed low. 

I looked up the primary numbers for Obama in 2012 though and while most were like high 90s or 100% you have a few areas where it was lower than what Biden got here. Didn't look back further but I'm guessing its not that uncommon."
3737,2020-05-03 19:37:49,gcr7zq,"Anything to downplay Biden's success, right?"
3738,2020-05-03 17:24:37,gcr7zq,"They actually sent out ballots well enough in advance that you could conceivably vote for Sanders before his campaign was suspended. I didn‚Äôt get mine in before that point, but he and Warren were still both on it."
3739,2020-05-03 19:03:03,gcr7zq,"No. I don‚Äôt care about that. The important thing is that a conservative red state had a successful Vote by Mail election. Voters were able to stay safe as well as do their civic duty. Hopefully Kansas can learn from this vote by mail election, what went well and what didn‚Äôt, and improve for the general election in the fall."

3747,2020-05-03 16:03:48,gcr7zq,Who did the other 23% of Kansas voters even vote for as the Democratic Presidential candidate. All the rest of Democratic Presidential candidates have dropped out. The DNC has a tough choice to make . . . Nominate Joe Biden and lose to Trump or nominate someone the Democratic primary voters did not vote for and lose to Trump. Why couldn‚Äôt the DNC do a better job of getting someone who could actually have a chance to become president?
3748,2020-05-04 03:00:20,gcr7zq,The one good thing hes done has been making explaining toxic masculinity for those who don't believe in it or know about it easy. You can just point to Trump and go it's that.

3750,2020-05-04 01:17:24,gcr7zq,"Trump was asked what he and his daughter have in common and he said ‚Äúsex‚Äù

This country can not handle another four years of a Twitter troll.  I‚Äôm not particularly thrilled Biden is the nominee either, but I have serious trump fatigue.  He has further divided us during a time we should all come together.

I‚Äôve seen the videos you are referring to and there is absolutely nothing there unless you just want there to be.  I would be one if the first to say if there was.

With McConnell the majority leader and the Supreme Court at stake I want a person in office who knows he‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt have a group of sycophants willing to support him no matter what.  There will be more accountability, then we demand change.

Republicans dropped every moral they clung to for this guy and we can‚Äôt do the same.  Trump has exposed a lot and people are engaged, that‚Äôs a good thing, but he has to be voted out.  He‚Äôs burning everything he comes in contact with.  We are stuck in our homes because of his poor leadership."

Answer  in terms of 911s"
3761,2020-05-03 22:04:40,gcr7zq,"You are talking about me, I live in Kansas and voted. I voted for Bernie because I knew that Biden had the nomination but want to put pressure on him to consider left leaning policies."
3762,2020-05-03 19:26:02,gcr7zq,"And voting started March 30th.

Biden is the only viable candidate now, but not back then."
3763,2020-05-03 22:06:34,gcr7zq,"After Obama meddled in the primary, persuaded other moderates to step down and basically consolidated that vote around Sleepy Joe (while Warren remained in the race seemingly only to steal votes from Bernie - shows you how much she cares about her ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù agenda), it was pretty clear that Biden would be gifted the nomination by default. 

Moreover, there has been pretty much zero campaigning of any kind since early March.  

So yeah, expected; if anything, I would‚Äôve expected Biden to finish stronger (85%+)."
3764,2020-05-04 02:18:34,gcr7zq,As opposed to the one who barely got 30% of the total votes? lmao
3765,2020-05-03 17:21:56,gcr7zq,"he sued to have his name on the ballot in NYC, he was already on the ballot in Kansas"
3766,2020-05-03 16:44:21,gcr7zq,Because it‚Äôs fucked to conduct the primary without the challenger
3767,2020-05-03 19:03:51,gcr7zq,"Yeah but he also ended his campaign AND endorsed Biden. So regardless of voting for him so he can have delegates, the vast majority of the voter pool who would have voted for Sanders aren't going to because they aren't going to see any point in doing so.

Bernie fucked himself super hard. If he knew his candidacy was effectively over, but still wanted delegates, the best thing he could have done was stay in the race till the end.

Now he's losing voters (not supporters) simply because people think there's no point anymore.

And that's entirely because he ended his campaign and endorsed his opponent.

I'm a Sanders man, myself, but doing those two things were a big big mistake."
3768,2020-05-03 21:10:32,gcr7zq,Not really. Anybody who seriously thinks that Bernie can still win is betting on Biden being forced to drop either because of the sexual assault allegations or his mental health.
3769,2020-05-04 00:50:54,gcr7zq,Literal lies lol why even bother?
3770,2020-05-03 16:37:23,gcr7zq,That is laughably inaccurate
3771,2020-05-03 16:40:57,gcr7zq,"I mean, no new presidential race polling has been published since March, but it shows Trump with a **12-point lead** in Kansas. That's a pretty freaking big gap to close.

I'm not sure where you're getting that, but I wouldn't get too hopeful."
3772,2020-05-03 16:30:27,gcr7zq,i am a-ok with that!

3774,2020-05-03 15:43:48,gcr7zq,Bernie was still in the race when voting began
3775,2020-05-03 17:25:47,gcr7zq,"Bernie was on the ballot, and according to his deal with Biden, he still gets to keep all his delegates (from this primary and others) to influence the platform. Votes here are not wasted because Sanders dropped out."
3776,2020-05-03 17:01:07,gcr7zq,"I think it being a done deal actually gets rid of the ‚ÄúI want X Candidate but will vote Joe because I think only he can win‚Äù vote though. It frees people up to vote for who they want. I‚Äôm actually kind of heartened that he won 77%. I‚Äôm in NY, so our primary was cancelled, but I planned on casting a vote for someone else."
3777,2020-05-03 20:57:15,gcr7zq,Yes because his margins of victory are consistent going back To Super Tuesday.
3778,2020-05-03 16:32:50,gcr7zq,"Not really notable, since Biden was kicking Bernie's ass by double digits anyhow before Bernie suspend his campaign due to math."
3779,2020-05-03 18:44:34,gcr7zq,"Yeah, getting 77% on an uncontested ballot is not the best look."
3780,2020-05-03 15:56:49,gcr7zq,In what way?
3781,2020-05-03 16:16:17,gcr7zq,"Yeah, a bunch of crooked Bernie supporters stayed home on primary day, and another bunch of crooked voters voted for Biden.

Oooh, the criminality!"
3782,2020-05-03 21:18:32,gcr7zq,"Thanks! Let's hope it's as painless for me as it has been for you. I actually went to college in DeKalb years ago, so Illinois isn't a completely alien place to me, but I did have a hard time voting a couple times back then (mostly because they kept moving my polling location around)."
3783,2020-05-03 22:33:56,gcr7zq,Vote by mail + switching from caucus to primary = increased turnout
3784,2020-05-04 01:09:34,gcr7zq,"It also has to do with the fact that the two biggest idiots in the state, in Susan Wagle and Kris KKKobach, are angling for the Pat Robert's seat, and if either one of them get the nomination, you can bet your life that seat is going blue. People in the eastern half of the state are absolutely sick of GOP's horseshit, and there's been huge turnout for just about every race over the last four years."

The whole system of our democracy needs a huge overhaul. It's not 1808 anymore. We have 350 million citizens, the internet, television, etc. No vote should ever be meaningless, but we have SO MANY meaningless votes these days because the system doesn't fit our needs anymore."
3790,2020-05-03 18:46:43,gcr7zq,That leaves a voter in a better position than the people who voted for one of those dropped out candidates but also have a preference between the remaining ones.

Again, this was when it was down to him and joe running, joe Biden, the person who represents everything Bernie is against from money in politics to him outright saying if M4A came on his desk he will veto it. 

Bernie has a good message and definitely already pushed the party further left than most career politicians will do in a lifetime, but he‚Äôs spineless and unwilling to do what‚Äôs needed to be done for his ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù to succeed. If you‚Äôre expecting him to actually try to leverage his delegates for sway you haven‚Äôt been paying attention, he will back Biden no matter what he does, and what‚Äôs worse is Biden‚Äôs handlers know it, so they won‚Äôt even believe his bluffs."

3867,2020-05-03 22:32:47,gcr7zq,"In the wake of September 11, Biden stood as a leading Democratic voice on foreign policy, chairing the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee. As President Bush attempted to sell the US public on the war, Biden became one of the administration‚Äôs steadfast allies in this cause, backing claims about the supposed threat posed by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and insisting on the necessity of removing him from power."
3868,2020-05-03 19:42:03,gcr7zq,"Can't say about WA, but I remember seeing OR (another long time vote by mail state) has some of the highest presidential year general election turnout. Higher than almost any non-competitive state, and higher than some swing states too. Oregon vote-by-mail got my young, politically checked out brother in law to vote for the first time in 2018."

The state also has [historical turn-out information for WA elections](https://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/research/voter-turnout-by-election.aspx)... it takes some work to interpret because more major elections have much higher turnout, so you need to make sure you're comparing elections of similar importance. Looking at it that way, I don't actually see any obvious patterns at the transition, but I haven't looked closely."

I took part in that caucus in 2016 and [it was insane](https://www.kstatecollegian.com/2016/03/06/photos-democratic-caucus/). If the fire marshall had been called, we would have been kicked out of the gym.

3875,2020-05-03 20:54:48,gcr7zq,"Do the numbers include turnout of both parties? Either way that is impressive.

My state Texas 2016 vs 2020 turnout:

Republican: 2.7m-> 1.9m
Democrat: 1.5m -> 2.1m

According to primary turnout, Texas leans slightly blue. However I think that is heavily influenced by no Republican presidential primary. Since Beto didn't beat Cruz 2 years ago, it seems extremely optimistic for Texas to go blue.

Most stat analysis I see doesn't account for this shift, which is why I'm extremely skeptical of most stats coming out of this cycle."

Mass alteration of mail in ballots would be a pretty monumental task though. Destroying a single one is two federal crimes. Installing operatives at a million postal offices seems impossible. You‚Äôd have to alter them after receiving them ‚Äî and if there‚Äôs some point that you‚Äôre left in charge of them in receipt and able to alter them, you‚Äôd be just as able to alter in-person ballots"
3883,2020-05-04 00:26:11,gcr7zq,"Voter fraud is when and individual attempts to illegally vote or attempts to illegally alter a ballot. There is almost no voter fraud in the United States. There was only 1 instance in 2016 (commutes by a Republic voter). Voter fraud is a slow process and not very effective at changing the results of an election.

Election fraud when an organization or individual attempts to systematically alter the results of an election typically by preventing people from voting, hacking voting machines, destroying ballot boxes, or posing as an electoral officer to illegally collect and destroy ballots. There is an instance of election fraud before the courts where the republicans did exactly that last thing to steal and election.

The worry isn‚Äôt about individuals committing voter fraud. It doesn‚Äôt happen even in states that already have 100% vote by mail. The worry is to what lengths will the Republican Party go to systematically disenfranchise voters."

3932,2020-05-03 16:08:55,gcr7zq,It was pretty obvious the democratic establishment put their thumbs on the scale to push Biden to the front after his win in South Carolina if you cared to pay attention.
3933,2020-05-03 16:09:10,gcr7zq,Obama getting the field to consolidate behind Joe basically the night before super Tuesday was pretty fucking crooked.  There's no way Pete drops out before Tuesday after winning Iowa under a normal time line.

Voter turn out was not historic or high across the board this year.

Is no one concerned that red state democratic support is simply symbolic, and won't translate to actual flips come November?

Edit - I totally missed MO, Wyo. and Ark. too as red states that Biden won, but for what? I mean, nearly half the states that have primaried are going to go for Trump. I'd live to be wrong, but that chunk of Dem voters doesn't represent the nation as a whole (obviously)."

3961,2020-05-03 20:12:41,gcr7zq,"That was 26 years ago. Obviously that looks bad/worse now through today‚Äôs lens, but let‚Äôs not pretend that failing to fully believe and support women was considered as big a moral failing back then as it is now. 

Further, let‚Äôs look at what actually [happened](https://www.google.com/amp/s/thehill.com/homenews/campaign/441408-timeline-a-history-of-the-joe-biden-anita-hill-controversy%3famp). One, he didn‚Äôt vote to confirm Thomas. Two, he was criticized for not defended her vigorously enough. Even soon after the nomination, he expressed contrition.

> Eight months after the hearings, Biden told The Washington Post that he worried he had not ""attacked the attackers"" of Hill ""more frequently and consistently.""

>However, he said he couldn't have acted differently toward Thomas without violating ""the basic values embodied in our constitutional system.""

>""That's what makes me mad about the Republicans,"" Biden said in the June 1992 interview.

>""What they do is they put you in a position on so many matters of principle that in order to fight with them and have a chance of winning, you have to either have the ability to go right above the issue, or you've got to do it the way they do it and disregard the rules,"" he added.

Soon after, he co-sponsored the violence against women act. That alone should show he wasn‚Äôt completely indifferent to the plight of women generally. Years later, he also said:

> Biden then spoke to Teen Vogue in December 2017 and reemphasized that he ""believed"" Hill and that he regretted not stopping ""the attacks on her by some of my Republican friends.""

>""And I insisted the next election - I campaigned for two women senators on the condition that if they won they would come on the Judiciary Committee, so there would never be again all men making a judgment on this,"" Biden said.

So is he perfect? No. But how is him not being a white knight a huge demerit when the GOP literally tried to destroy Hill? Not in my opinion, especially when he has expressed contrition, and when he was not even a principle bad actor in this scenario.

A vote for Biden is a vote against that message on various levels. Bernie supporters aren‚Äôt just going to vote for Biden because Bernie said so.

The DNC will blame Bernie, but, it‚Äôs because of the extreme ideological differences that break the vote.

As far as needing to look at data: I guess Bernie himself needs to 'look at the data', as he [said](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/06/812486517/bernie-sanders-call-for-young-voters-isn-t-working-out-the-way-he-planned) he wasn't seeing young people show up in the numbers he expected. That isn't really surprising either, since it's a long standing truth in American politics that compared to older voters, the youth just don't show up.

Bernie consistently [underperformed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/03/despite-his-promised-turnout-surge-sanders-is-getting-fewer-votes-than-he-did-2016/?arc404=true) in states he did well in for 2016.

>Most of the convictions involved people who cast a ballot in two different states. Many of the cases initially involved felony charges, but all were eventually reduced to a violation.

> None resulted in jail time. The maximum penalty was $1,000 and 10 hours of community service for 45-year-old Michael Cruz of Portland.

> On the low end, a judge waived a proposed $440 fine on 40-year-old Jeremy Robbins, also of Portland. Prosecutors said Robbins cast a ballot in both Oregon and Washington.

> ‚ÄúAt the time of the election, (Robbins) was suffering from kidney infections which impacted his cognition,‚Äù said Oregon Department of Justice spokeswoman Kristina Edmunson. ‚ÄúHe does not remember voting two ballots, but acknowledges that he did and is extremely remorseful.‚Äù

> The most recent conviction was of Betty Clark of Haines, Oregon. Clark was 76 at the time of the election.

> Her attorney, Martin Leuenberger of Baker City, said Clark had been temporarily living in Vancouver, Washington in order to care for her elderly father. While there, she received a ballot in the mail for the upcoming election, filled it out, and returned it.

> Around that time, her father passed away. Clark and her husband moved back to their rural Baker County home, where there was an Oregon ballot awaiting her. ‚ÄúShe forgot about the other one,‚Äù said Leuenberger. ‚ÄúIt was an innocent mistake. There was no criminal intent whatsoever.‚Äù

> Originally, Clark was charged with voting in two states, which is a felony. In an agreement with prosecutors, that charge was dropped and Clark pleaded guilty in late March to a lesser charge of ‚Äúvoting when not entitled.‚Äù It was treated as a violation on par with a speeding ticket, and Clark was ordered to pay $440. She did not appear in court.

> Leuenberger said the reduced charge shows the lack of malicious motives on the part of his client. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get me wrong,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhat she did was wrong, but it was a mistake. She‚Äôs very embarrassed.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúShe was under a lot of stress at the time because of the move and the loss of her father,‚Äù said Leuenberger, who said he‚Äôs known the family for years.

> Edmunson said that sort of reduced charge is not unusual. ‚ÄúGenerally, as long as the voter has no criminal history and has not voted from two states during the same election before, we offer a violation and fine,‚Äù she said."

A lot of people assume it‚Äôs not happening.  Aside from proving it‚Äôs possible technically (which it has been- even quite easy), then exit polls differ outside the margin of error are one of the only ways to detect it.  Perniciously, exit polls are often changed at the end to correspond with the official vote tallies, making them useless to detect fraud unless one has the earlier exit polls before they were changed.  

This happened in this year‚Äôs presidential primary in Massachusetts and likely happened in other states as well.  People like to believe as a default that there is no fraud, or very little, but after examining it a little more and seeing what evidence is out there, I believe the default belief should be the other way."

Trump's share of the primary vote after he pretty much locked in the nomination hovered between 60-80%, close to what we are seeing here, and he clearly didn't have a turnout or enthusiasm issue. 

I keep asking people who insist that Bernie was more electable for a single data point that indicates that to be a reality. Instead, the data showed that in order for him to win he would have to create unprecedented turnout in youth voters, something which specifically did not materialize during the primary."

Utah. Wow, winning one of the deepest red states matters now, because Bernie is the one to win it?

North Dakota. Sure, Hillary lost by almost 40 points to Donald Trump, but surely Bernie could turn that around.

So, I'll be voting for Biden in November. I'll hate every second of it, won't be able to look myself in the mirror for a week, but I'll do it. That having been said -- words mean fuck all. Actions are what matter. And Biden's actions paint a very different picture from his words. It's all well and good that he's apologetic about fucking over Anita Hill, but it does literally nothing to fix his actions. 

Hell, even in the quote you gave: 

>""the attacks on her by some of my Republican friends.""

These are the people you say (correctly) literally tried to destroy Hill. His friends. 

And I also take issue with characterizing ""not putting her through hell"" as ""white knight[ing]"". It's just not being an awful fucking person. Billions of people manage it every single day.

4129,2020-05-03 15:34:30,gcr7zq,"At the time Reade claims to have been assaulted, Brock Adams, a prominent Democratic senator, had been accused of sexual assault by several women. It ended his campaign and career. 1992 and 1993 had their own sort of #MeToo movement at that time with many articles in women‚Äôs magazines and major newspapers running stories regarding sexual harassment and rape. In my early 20s at the time, at university and starting my first job, it was a big thing with changes in workplace behavior and norms happening.

With that being said, it‚Äôs rather strange that Reade wouldn‚Äôt remember the Adams scandal, and would feel she couldn‚Äôt come forward. Coming forward with a rape/assault claim was being strongly supported and encouraged at that time. As well, having just had women accuse a sitting senator and be believed, you would think 1) Biden would be hyper aware of it and be extra, EXTRA, careful to not do anything that could be considered untoward, and 2) had Biden done so, Reade would be hyper aware that women were being take seriously with their allegations and feel a little more secure in making her claim. She was working in DC ... in the senate ... with Democrats ... at the exact time a prominent Democrat had been destroyed by sexual assault/rape allegations, and the women were overwhelmingly taken seriously.  Yet Reade claims no one would believe her or listen to her ... hmmmm ....

The King show has only one thing that concretely ties the caller to the Reade‚Äôs mother, that the caller states she‚Äôs from the city Reade‚Äôs mother was living in at that time. Other than that, the caller herself makes no mention of Reade, who the politician is, when or what the ‚Äòproblem‚Äô happened/is other than her daughter couldn‚Äôt ‚Äòget through‚Äô and had just left there. We have only Reade‚Äôs claim that it‚Äôs her mother‚Äôs voice. As well, the caller is asking what a staffer could do other than go to the press? This undermines Reade‚Äôs claim that her mother insisted she tell the police.  Why would her mother call King‚Äôs show asking what else a staffer could do? 

At best, the King clip does nothing to support Reade‚Äôs claims and nothing to negate her claims. It‚Äôs a wash at most. Why people continue to point to it as some hard evidence of Reade‚Äôs claims is beyond me."

I feel like the only way for the DNC to appreciate progressives is for progressives to show the DNC that they will lose votes in the general if they dont start pushing for progressive values. I feel like voting 3rd party and Dem downballot forces the DNC to do that and it prevents Trump from having control of both the senate and the house.

>But what really concerns me is you live in Wisconsin.

Yes but I go to college at Penn St. So I have registered in center county which is a swing district in a swing state. So hopefully the DNC learns its lesson and picks a progressive next cycle.

This depends on how progressive Biden makes his cabinet. If he appoints enough progressive I would consider voting for him."

Nothing I said indicated the entire '90s was a time of unbridled gender egalitarianism.  It's AMAZING how you've managed to miss the ENTIRE point of my comment.

Let me paint a pretty little picture of it so you don't miss it this time.

1) Reade claims she was sexually assaulted by Biden exactly during a time when a prominent Democrat had been accused of that exact thing and the accusers were all believed with their stories on everybody's lips.

2) It was a doozy of a scandal.  Reade seems to have no recollection of this.  It boggles the mind that Biden wouldn't be aware of this and extra cautious.

3) Many men were hyper aware of sexual assault and extra cautious. Does that mean Biden wouldn't assault anyone? No, but it certainly gives one pause as to her claim that no one would listen to her because women weren't believed or listened to at that time.  It was a year when women were telling their sexual assault stories everywhere.

4) 1992-1993 was dubbed the 'Year of the Woman' because a lot of  women were elected to Congress.  These women ran in direct retaliation to the Anita Hill hearings.  It was ALL  ABOUT women being heard and believed and women taking power."

What are you trying to insinuate by her adopting big tent policies? Every candidate wants a big tent. Sanders had his press secretary bending over backwards to defend support from anti-trans and far right sanders support. No tennant of progressivism requires it to be a small inclusive club.

The DNC continues to adopt more progressive policies from Sanders, which is good, I think we need him pushing the party left on some issues.  
  
And I understand your desire to stand up to the DNC, and in the reality it is very likely no one vote will change the election, but I'll admit stories like yours scare me. I am scared of 4 more years of Trump the absolute damage it will do to America. I myself don't hate Biden, I actually like him, I'm not excited to vote for him but I think he'll be at least competent. If there is anyway I can help change few peoples votes in swing states I would feel better. Sorry this is going off in a random direction. In any case, I hope as the election gets closer you reevaluate what the priorities are: proving your point to a party that in reality you agree with ideologically on several issues, or ensuring Trump does not have the ability to select two more SCOTUS judges and continues to destroy the morality of America.

Republicans spend a greater emphasis on advocating what they are against rather than what they are specifically for. The rhetoric between the 2 platforms is pretty clear on that which is why it might not be memorable. Probably an effective strategy to keep the base riled up.

The party platform is a way for the party to build a backbone for which their future bills are based on. The least amount of time needed to agree on what they actual want and start hammering the specifics the better especially when their time is limited between elections. You are right though, it is also something for people interested in politics, like you and me, to get excited about. It is very important to get those people excited; they are the ones who canvass, call, and donate. Their energy bleeds into the average voter as much, if not more than advertisements, rallies, or big name endorsements sometimes. And that is why I'd argue for the importance of Bernie's name to stay on the primary ballot and for the people to believe in his policies to vote for him for the primaries.

It's a term, you could define it as the following: ""an outsider candidate with a large base of support."" Large is relative and could even just mean a fringe candidate with a cult following (though it's usually used to describe people a bit more popular than that).

It's a slang term and it doesn't even imply that the ""people's candidate"" has the largest following or the most votes. You're taking the term super literally. It's just a slang term... Like ""underdog"" or ""establishment candidate"". It's just a term. It doesn't literally mean the person that's most popular, like you're misinterpreting it to mean. It's not literal. It's a term used occasionally in political discussions to describe a specific type of candidate: a party ""outsider"" that is popular with a lot people."

It's a slang term with a describes a specific type of candidate: one that is NOT generally backed by the party yet is popular with the people. It's just a term, dude.

Of course voting says something about who's the most popular. I'm not arguing that. A people's candidate doesn't even have anything to do with that. An establisment party member can absolutely be the MOST popular with the people, but he wouldn't be a ""people's candidate"" because that's not what that term means.

I don't know how many other ways to say this but ""people's candidate"" is a specific thing and it doesn't mean the MOST popular. It just means a candidate that's generally popular but not popular amongst the party establishment. It's often used to describe, like, an outsider candidate that has a large following. In fact you could just replace the term with that phrase if that makes it less confusing to you. It doesn't even mean he has a the LARGEST following. You're trying to take the term super literally for some reason when all it is is a slang term that means something else that what you thought at first."

You could also do it by not having the primaries spread out over months across different states -- people in late primary states will usually not get their views represented at all, and there's really no reason to not just do all the primaries at once other than to give earlier states disproportionate influence.  It'd also be nice if party officials would stay out of the endorsement game and let the people reach their own conclusions about candidates instead of telling them who to vote for."

***Once again***, first Reade wouldn't have  been the first to accuse a man in power of sexual assault. Yes it was a record number for that time (Jesus Christ you're going out of your way to be insulting to women -- what is your problem?!) 

Brock Adam's career was actively being destroyed by people listening to and believing women who accused a man of power at the **very time** Reade claims no one would listen to women and she couldn't tell anyone.

For Reade to claim she kept silent because no one would listen to her at a time when, in the very place she claims she was assaulted, D.C., a prominent  senator was losing his career due to sexual assault claims, is a bit hard to swallow.  There is no way she didn't know that was happening.  There is no way she didn't understand the importance of those women's stories being heard and  believed is what led to that **Democratic senator** losing his career.

Seriously, what part of that **aren't** you understanding? (Don't answer that because you do understand, you're just willfully refusing to do so) It doesn't mean she couldn't have been assaulted or that she felt uncomfortable coming forward . . . but it CERTAINLY MEANS you have to question her insistence no one would listen when there was an ACTIVE CASE happening at that EXACT time where people were listening to women who were in what she claimed was her EXACT SITUATION -- assault by a man in power. 

Excuse me if I'm skeptical you ever worked on a Democratic campaign or supported a Democratic in your young life. Excuse if I don't bother to ever answer you again because you're not arguing in good faith."

If the NY Democratic party averages out the last few polls or takes the 538 NY projections to split the delegates between Biden and Sanders, I don't really see how it's the deathknell of democracy given the unique circumstances and the fact that the primaries are over.

Sanders wanted to win as many delegates as possible even after suspending his campaign and endorsing Biden so that he could put his supporters on committees at the convention, but he and Biden worked out an arrangement where he'll be given those committee spots regardless of the vote."

If it wasnt' for that case then I would agree that the primary needs to be held but he's been promised a percentage of the delegates and Biden has said yes Sanders needs those to be part of the platform as well. 

It just comes off as very two faced and power hungry when New York is one of the areas worst hit and any undue strain like that for something that's been decided seems... honestly really stupid. The reset of the elections have been delayed to a safer time but primaries are  pretty much pointless at this point unless, as I said, ther were more then 2 people left who could have a significant effect on delegate counts."

4534,2020-05-04 02:43:09,gcr7zq,"Individual members push for what they believe in and if enough people push for it it gets a vote.

Here is an example: if somehow the democratic platform dropped its desire to have a $15 minimum wage, do you think support for it would change at all among the democratic rank and file? I do not.  Do you think there would be less state reps fighting for it and less congressional reps fighting for it? I do not.  Do you think any of the democrats running for president were basing their positions on the platform versus their own beliefs?  I do not.

Candidates run on what THEY believe, not based on the platform.  They fight for what they believe, not based on the platform.  If they are in the house, they join caucuses with people who believe as they do and if the caucus is big enough they have the power to force legislation.  

Republicans tried to repeal the ACA because they had been screaming about it as the worst thing ever for a decade.  I am sure something about being pro life is in there.  I do not changing the platform to remove either of those would change the positions of a single party member.

The writers of both platforms openly admit that it exists to excite the base.  They do not pretend it is binding or that it is going to become law.  They write it to rally the base around a set of ideals.  They do not pretend it has any influence beyond that.  Bernie Sanders changed the democratic party not by changing the platform, but by getting 40% of the vote and inspiring a wing of the party to run for seats and take power and by campaigning for what he did he made those ideas part of the conversation.  The platform did not, he did."

4568,2020-05-03 18:09:22,gcr7zq,"Unless you can point me to statements encouraging dangerous action, I can't see the hypocrisy.

I believe urging a state to go ahead immediately with in person voting (sending your surrogate on to television to say it is safe to go out and vote if you don't show symptoms yourself), not putting public pressure on the state to delay the primary was bad and dangerous. I believe it has had consequences that can be measured in lives.

  
I don't believe wanting to ensure that a primary is held at all is bad nor dangerous. People who are pushing for immediate in person voting, (or if, for example, they didn't care about precautions for workers counting ballots) would be bad, but *just* wanting the primary to occur is not.

I can't know everything that's been said on this topic by everyone who claims to represent or support Sanders, so if any of it falls under the transgressions mentioned in the above paragraph I would in no way defend it.  But again - whether or not a deal has been made for *some* delegates, or the stakes of the primary seem insignificant to some people - the view that the primary should be held at *some point* in time, by *some safe* means is hardly in the same realm as lying to people, downplaying the risk of their actions in order to get their votes.

4577,2020-05-04 04:19:00,gcr7zq,"In my opinion the party's platform is akin to a large collection of campaign promises by the party on major issues that the most of the party can agree on. If they drop something as big as 15$ min wage, they will fill that void with another solution that that they agree upon together. The actual platform is very big and covers every major issue. But it does depend on the issue. Obviously things change and maybe their stance on the middle east changed drastically in a couple of months after the election. They don't have to be beholden to what they said when they didn't know all the details. 

I'm not trying to argue that it is the end all be all of documents. I'm just trying to say that it is an important step in the process of changing the laws. It is supposed to be a large set of issues and solutions that most of the party can agree on is important enough to tackle within the next election cycle. 

Of course individual congress people are going to fight for their own beliefs. AOC fighting for the green new deal comes to mind. There were a lot of elements in the green new deal that weren't in the 2016 platform that she put forth, and there were some elements that probably were in the platform. And of course Joe Manchin is probably not in favor of the green new deal due to his constituents.  

The platform isn't just about exciting the base. It has value because it is built on their collective values. You're right about the Bernie thing and him changing the party as a whole. The platform changed because of him, the goals of the democratic party changed because of him (and his supporters). But I don't think it is a stretch to say that if the platform reflected more of Hilary's ideals and that Bernie didn't push for the changes in the platform, the bill sitting for senate approval would say 12$ min wage increase. The platform is just a small puzzle piece in the grand collective of writing legislation. Again its just a plan for what they want to focus on based on the consensus of their beliefs. 

My original argument in this thread was to justify the continuation of the primaries with Bernie still on the ballot. We all know for a fact he isn't going to win. At this point, I don't even want him to get the nomination because that would probably be bad for the optics of the party against trump after everyone is already throwing their support behind Biden. But if Bernie gets a lot of delegates, he then gets the clout to shift the conversation left (which is what you said and is arguably more important than the platform in the long run) forcing the DNC to coalesce on a more progressive stance. I also think it is important information for the DNC to collect to gauge how each voting district behaves so that they have more information on which county is super progressive and which county is more conservative."

But let's not kid, Biden agreed to appoint Sanders delegates at the convention. That's beyond what the normal rules set.

Edit: To further clarify (since this is pretty noteworthy), the rules say that when a candidate drops out then 1/3 of their delegates are reallocated to whoever's left in the race (in this case Biden). Biden and Sanders made an agreement that Biden would fill those slots he recieved with Sanders delegates, so that Sanders' supporters will keep their influence going into the convention.

Not every state did ranked choice ballots (how the hell would that even work with proportional delegate allocation anyways, does your vote go to second choice only if your candidate is non viable?).  I'm talking about doing away with delegates and staggered contests completely and replacing it with a specific ranked choice counting system which would ensure that voters can express their actual preferences, that nobody has to drop out to save another candidate's campaign, and that at the end of the day we get a winner that is preferred over every other candidate individually.

Also I'm pretty sure AOC's endorsement didn't convince anyone to vote for Bernie who wasn't already going to vote for him, while we had endorsements like Clyburn's which singlehandedly decided nearly 20% of the votes in SC (based on exit poll data, if I remember correctly about 37% of voters decided in the last few days and 47% listed Clyburn's endorsement as a major factor).  In contrast we have Obama who didn't endorse anyone until everyone had dropped out.  If he had endorsed Biden before Iowa or something, I don't think Biden would have lost a single contest.

I was all in for Bernie in 2020 as well and didn't get to vote thanks to President Tide Pod not taking this pandemic seriously. But you know what? Bernie _lost the primary_. It sucks, but that's how it works.

You don't get to throw a tantrum just because your favorite guy lost. Biden got more votes. End of story. It sucks, but that's how it goes. So you've got to face reality: The US President from 2021 to 2025 will be one of two people: Joe Biden or Donald Trump.

That's it. Those are your choices. You can vote Spoiler Candidate Green if want, sure. You can vote Spoiler Candidate Libertarian if you want, sure. But neither of those will win. You choices are: 

1. Shit sandwich with shards of broken glass in it just like we got last time.

2. Overcooked and underseasoned chicken.

3. A nice salad.

4. Some bacon.

That's it. And thanks to FPTP and the electoral college, options 3 and 4 can't win. And it _sucks_. I get it. But your choice affects *everyone*. Because if more people pick the shit sandwich with glass, guess what? We *all* get that shit sandwich.

When you sit there and say ""Well *I'll* go against the grain and vote we get the salad!"" that's cool, but you're wasting your vote, and you've helped whoever you'd *never* vote for.

No one can say ""Yeah, I'd like the salad, but if that's not possible, give me the chicken."" Nope, you gotta go all or nothing, dude. That's how our electoral system works. I hate it. It's awful. But it's what we have, and if you want the game changed, you gotta play by the rules as they are now. Throwing a tantrum and saying ""Well **I** won't vote for evil at all!"" doesn't help anyone, not even yourself. All you're doing is helping ensure we're stuck with fucking concentration camps for another 4 years while you get to act all high and mighty.

And you know what? I didn't want Clinton in 2016, and I nearly voted 3rd party, but you know what I did? I examined the two choices, and I said ""Holy shit, Cheeto Benito here needs to be stopped.""

I think I was pretty clear that I don't support the idea of party officials endorsing candidates during the primary.  It will always favor members of the in group over new ideas, and ultimately results in us waiting a long time for people to die or retire before the party can be updated to align with the views of the electorate again.  Consider why a bipartisan majority of people in the US support legalizing weed, but virtually no republicans in congress support it and the best Biden supports is moving it to schedule II (which he calls decriminalization, but let's be realistic, nothing will change here).  We could also look at universal background checks for firearm purchases, which has even
more bipartisan support but is still opposed by one party only in Congress.  One would think that our elected representatives would seek to represent the views of the people.

When Bernie says ‚ÄúI got news for the Democratic establishment. You can‚Äôt stop us‚Äù

That r/agedlikemilk comment sealed the deal.

>The big mistake the DNC made was ignoring populism that surprisingly the Republican party realized was more likely to win than the same old establishment crap.

Again, the DNC didn‚Äôt do anything. I really don‚Äôt understand how y‚Äôall can simultaneously hate an org so vigorously without understanding what they even do.

>Dems are going to make the same mistake they made in 2016. Such a shame. The rest of the world now has to deal with Donald Trump for 4 more years.

Biden can win. Bernie lost, get over it. His base was always too small to win."

Not even close to what I said but I‚Äôm admittedly impressed with how you managed to make yourself a victim so effortlessly. 

As for the rest of the euphoric political enlightenment that follows, it could be a copypasta about any generic candidate that has managed to attract a cult following. I‚Äôm sure you can find an almost word for word comment about Ron Paul on the ancap subreddit without looking too hard. 

We get it. The two party system sucks. Every half aware person before you has figured that out. It‚Äôs like how every generation thinks it‚Äôs the first one to discover drugs and sex and underground music. We‚Äôve all discovered the system sucks. 

But here‚Äôs the thing. 

The dnc didn‚Äôt lose the primaries for Bernie. The drawn out primary system is dumb in many regards but it‚Äôs also advantageous in that it allows for a prolonged vetting process, but most importantly it‚Äôs not new and wasn‚Äôt designed with screwing Bernie in mind. In fact, it‚Äôs one of the major factors that aided Obama‚Äôs nomination over other more establishment candidates. 

And here‚Äôs another thing. 

Bernie is not the savior of the world. He‚Äôs a lifelong politician who‚Äôs biggest claim is that he doesn‚Äôt formally register with the party that he votes with, and it‚Äôs frankly laughable to think that he would lead some populist revolution when he couldn‚Äôt even lead supporters to the polls to stand in line and vote. 

And here‚Äôs yet another thing. 

Believe it or not, people that didn‚Äôt vote for Bernie (üêç) or who didn‚Äôt endorse Bernie aren‚Äôt all brainwashed by the DNC, the South Carolina governor, CNN, or whoever the boogie man of the day is. People have complex motivations for their decisions, and to think that the brothers are the only people enlightened enough to see that things could be better, or to see that the two party system is dysfunctional and not primarily serving the people, or are the only people too smart to be brainwashed by [insert entity here] is completely asinine."

**Article**:

> It was hard to tell if Joe Biden or President¬†Trump would be appearing¬†in south central Pennsylvania on Thursday by the looks of crowds gathered near the presumptive Democratic nominee&apos;s campaign stop.

> Pro-Trump supporters were out in force in Lancaster, holding Trump signs and chanting ""Four more years!"" and ""U-S-A!"" as they gathered roughly 100 yards from where Biden would be unveiling his proposals on health care.

> At one point, a large semi-truck, bearing photos of Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, pulled up outside a local recreational center where a pro-Trump crowd was assembled.

> BIDEN TAKES AIM AT TRUMP OVER HEALTH CARE DURING BATTLEGROUND STATE STOP

> The truck drove in between the Trump supporters and another group nearby that declared their support for the Black Lives Matter¬†movement.

> Biden traveled to the battleground state to¬†meet with families who said they&apos;ve benefited from the Affordable Care Act, the health care legislation also known as ObamaCare that was passed when Biden was former President Barack Obama&apos;s vice president. The campaign stop came on¬†the same day the Trump administration was expected to urge¬†the Supreme Court¬†to invalidate the¬†national health care law.

> ""I think it‚Äôs cruel, it‚Äôs heartless, it‚Äôs callous,‚Äù Biden said of Trump‚Äôs attempts to dismantle ObamaCare. ""It‚Äôs all because in my view he can‚Äôt abide the thought of letting stand one of President Obama‚Äôs great achievements.""

> Biden also criticized Trump&apos;s notion¬†that¬†fewer tests would¬†mean fewer cases of the coronavirus, as health experts have urged the importance of testing to limit the spread of the virus and identify those infected.

> ‚ÄúHe called testing, quote, a double-edge sword,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúLet&apos;s be crystal clear about what he means by that. Testing unequivocally saves lives and widespread testing is the key to opening our economy. That&apos;s one edge of the sword. The other edge, he thinks that finding out that more Americans are sick will make him look bad.‚Äù

>  Democratic presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden speaks with families who have benefited from the Affordable Care Act, Thursday, June 25, 2020, in Lancaster, Pa. (Associated Press) <!---->

> Biden also mistakenly claimed during the campaign stop that 120 million people had died from the¬†novel coronavirus¬†-- overstating the number by about 1,000 times.

> ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt have a job, people don‚Äôt know where to go, they don‚Äôt know what to do,‚Äù Biden said Thursday. ‚ÄúNow we have over 120 million dead from COVID.‚Äù

> The U.S. has seen at least 124,000 deaths -- not millions -- from COVID-19, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Worldwide, more than¬†488,824 fatalities from the virus have been reported.

> Biden&apos;s comments were immediately questioned by Republicans and the Trump 2020 Campaign team, which deemed the Democrat to be ""very confused.""

> BIDEN SLAMMED AFTER WRONGLY SAYING &apos;WE HAVE OVER 120 MILLION DEAD FROM COVID&apos;

> ‚ÄúWHAT IS GOING ON WITH JOE BIDEN?‚Äù Steve Guest, the Republican National Committee‚Äôs rapid response director, tweeted out with a link to the clip.

> Meanwhile, the LNP newspaper,¬†headquartered in¬†Lancaster, said it was not permitted inside the building during Biden&apos;s appearance¬†and suggested that the Democrat&apos;s campaign was limiting¬†local media&apos;s ability to¬†report on the visit.¬†Lancaster&apos;s WGAL-TV¬†claimed it was the only local television station in the Susquehanna Valley area to speak with Biden one-on-one.

> Biden has recently¬†started¬†to make¬†more public appearances after months indoors amid the coronavirus pandemic.

> His campaign has so far focused on small group gatherings to limit the potential spread of the coronavirus, in contrast to President Trump, who recently held rallies in Tulsa, Okla., and Phoenix.

> After the June 20 Tulsa event, dozens of Secret Service members¬†were forced into quarantine because at least two of them had tested positive for the virus.

> CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

> ‚ÄúDonald Trump needs to stop caring about how he looks to start caring about what America has happened to the rest of America,"" Biden said.

> Fox News' Paul Steinhauser, Madeleine Rivera and Andrew O'Reilly contributed to this story.

The fact that we're a week from July in they don't know whether to endorse the only person running against Trump, and instead need to wait for an internal poll tells me they're not about leadership or change.

>ATTN MOVEON MEMBERS: We've opened our presidential endorsement vote. Check your email or texts for your official ballot. Vote closes Tues. Defeating Trump is our top priority & we believe this work will be strongest if we formally endorse Joe Biden via our member-led process. 

It makes it sound like they're planning to endorse Biden, they just want to formalize it with their members - maybe they're afraid of the bernie-or-bust-ers' reaction otherwise? It seems weird that they have to vote to decide whether to endorse the Democratic nominee, though."

The SOLE reason they win is because they operate that way and we don't.

We have a clear numerical advantage. Even accounting for the electoral college.

4755,2020-06-26 18:41:20,hg9fg8,Yes but to be fair they endorsed Sanders in January and made this statement after Clinton got the majority.

0.5% - Write in for Sanders

Also the ""Bothsiderism"" in South Park drove me crazy, too. Back before I got emotionally invested in politics, I used to love that show and watch it religiously. As I got older, I saw how dangerous and misleading it is for them to push messages like ""Giant Douche vs. Turd Sandwich"", and they seemed to make light out of Al Gore's efforts against climate change (i.e. ""Manbearpig""). I heard the creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker are Libertarians."

Do you think that by falsely claiming the investigation into Sunshine has been debunked that no one will bother to watch it? I certainly hope that's not all it takes--on a conspiracy board.

Merely posting ""meh that's been debunked"" doesn't quite cut it bro. Every woman in the videos are ""leaders"" in Sunshine. Odd, one would think that an ""expose"" explaining why we're watching white kids act like lunatics would gain some traction other than the old MUH TRUMP RAPIST bullshit that is so easily proven false it's not even funny and yet years of video of Joe Biden tweeking nipples with zero cares in the world--that's nothing. Who is Asymmetrical Solutions? How is Sunshine linked to BLM? Why is this group gaining access to highschool kids and teaching them how to get arrested and escalate? Why is the bogus climate change issue being used to whip these kids into a frenzy? How has the ""wear a mask"" campaign helped both Sunshine and BLM carry out their riots?

(inb4 climate change is real)--Right, and I wasn't on the spot when East Anglican University's climate department emails were hacked and posted. I wasn't right there reading verified emails between climate scientists on what the best way to hide the medieval warming period would be. I haven't worked on academic papers re the TPP which blew my mind as to how the hell Obama ever signed that, and I most certainly have not noticed how King Climate Alarm bought a 9 million dollar ocean front estate on Martha's Vineyard because rising ocean levels and ""we're all going to be dead in 12 years"" from rising ocean levels narrative didn't appear to bother HIM at all.

I'm not two years old son. So sad, really

\> Muh argument.

\>Drink your bleach.

Imagine believing the President told you to drink bleach. Something tells me you did not watch that press conference yourself. I know you couldn't have, because I did and no such thing happened. Imagine getting my reddit responses from CNN. Sad.

OTOH imagine not knowing that a woman who is being investigated for murdering her husband by putting fish tank cleaner in his food and taking just enough to make herself sick (after watching an episode of Forensic Files) got interviewed on MSM to blame it on Donald Trump, IMAGINE BEING THAT person that believed that bullshit interview and didn't bother to investigate because CNN fed your hate for the day.

Imagine being that stupid, that uneducated, and only able to spout strawman arguments because you are merely a robot on repeat for anything CNN tells you to believe.

Thankfully I wasn't raised in daycare and my father was in my life. My father was famous for his ""sayings"" many of which are with me every day, but the one that comes to mind here is, look at everything, from all angles and Kung Fu. Do you know what is Kung Fu? I'm sure that show would be called racist today, but it's still a lesson on maintaining balance and looking at all sides before doing that one thing...let me see if I can remember....""tis better to remain silent and thought a fool, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.""

There is no substitute for education. How sad that you are unable to respond to a well-laid out argument with counter points and logic rather than emotionally based straw men, I fear there is no where for you to go in life as clearly education isn't what it used to be.

""You're racist"" frothed the child.

And I say,  Ok. And?

After that son, you have no where to go. Sadly people have forgotten how to disarm people who come so poorly prepared to battle and jump to defend what needs no defense. See, your straw man does nothing, my feelings aren't hurt, I don't even feel dumber for having read it, it's just meaningless. And there's this little thing we learned back in the olden days, we used to sing it..""sticks and stones may break my bones but words can never harm me."" Whew lads, lol call me what ever you want, I yawn and that is what makes you furious. It also makes you furious to know I'm right.

Four more years. Just to mine the salt. Day by day as the temper tantrums continue, blue is turning red. And just like CNN lied to you about

\>Trump can't win

\>Trump WILL be impeached

they're lying to you now. There isn't anything they won't do to win. Nothing, because losing the election means losing everything. General Flynn is finally free. I actually fear for the sanity of those poor children (such as in that video, because that's what they are, children) when they realize they've been nothing but useful idiots for an organization that has nothing to do with black lives and racism.

On the other hand, making it OK to attend crowded protests with screaming fanatical angry ranting people babbling insensibly and waving their fists angrily in the air... but it's not OK to go to church.

Did you cheer at that? good good..good.  I bet that not once did it ever occur to you to think that through. Because you can't. You've been trained to react, not think. You've been trained, NAY autodomesticated to have a visceral reaction each and every time your perceived enemy appears to have been scored against.

Let's put on that thinking cap...and try to work this out, slowly. I may seem to be condescending, but hopefully I'm condescending in the right direction.

Making a law that only white people have to wear masks....do you know how hard I laughed when I heard that? When I heard the cheering and jeering and white people? Black people of lesser ""agency"" and their SJW counterparts were so happy, ""HA white people have to wear a mask and we don't""....and I wondered when that one penny would drop...if that last remaining brain cell would twitch--wait what?

Black people are the most vulnerable population---I can just about guarantee that you're going to have to meditate on that for at least a month before it strikes you. Do you know who started the ""black people are immune"" meme? I bet you don't. I was having a good old time watching the ""black people"" cheer and jeer on twitter. ""FINALLY some justice, all dey yt piple gon die"".

So, who started the ""black people are immune meme?"" I know the answer to this, why don't you? In fact I have their very first announcement that ""black people"", that they hate with a passion, (just in case you didn't know) were immune and I knew why they were announcing that. I also knew it wasn't true. But in the midst of all the ""black people"" celebrating how ""wyte all gon git dis and die"", I knew it was only a matter of time before the bodies started hitting the floor. Which population was hit the hardest?

Have you figured it out yet?

\>all people but black people have to wear masks

\>black people are the most vulnerable population

It may take a few years, but once it gets through all that propaganda clogging your head, you might actually take a few minutes to be horrified. THAT CAME FROM YOUR TEAM lad, your team."

PS Don wasn't grabbing lap dancers by the pussy, he walked the Earth like the entitled slubberdegullion he is at his core using his dick like a divining rod on women who didn't seek his attention, of course that was when he was on break from walking in on half dressed teens and bragging to Stern about it."

It's an obvious misspeak, it happens to everyone literally all of the time, and it's not like they're saying it to another world leader during a negotiation or something but even then it probably still wouldn't be a big deal. People misspeak and have brain farts all the time and most of them aren't spending 12 hours a day in front of open mics in front of a room of people trying to remember what stump speech is good for the Wyoming Arborist Society in the morning and the Philadelphia Women's Literature Association in the evening."

Little liberal minds exploding left and right, it was amazing.

Anyways. The problem as I see it is that we just want to be left alone to live our lives. Activism and moral outrage will trump that over time, every time, especially now that we all have permanent connected-ness and instant communication."

4987,2020-06-26 20:49:35,hg7nwt,"I think there‚Äôs truth to that but as it stands now there‚Äôs not a great way to test it. So long as there are a significant number of Hispanic people with a family member or friend who is here illegally, the party that‚Äôs saying ‚Äòthe law is bad, they can stay‚Äô has a permanent advantage over us. Policy matters, sentiment matters but personal relationships and identity matter much more a lot of the time. 

One could argue when they‚Äôre made citizens in huge numbers we‚Äôd see the power of clemency be mitigated, but California and Texas‚Äô post amnesty voting trends say otherwise. There‚Äôs always more people trying to come in and the sentiment would apply once again. 

I think many Hispanic people are more conservative than their voting trends would suggest, but I would also say there are some very leftist people amongst the Hispanic populations. Those from the islands in particular. Full on revolutionary socialism. Like any group of people, they vary by place as well as person to person though. 

I think maybe down the line we could see more Hispanic people vote republican but I think it will be a while and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it never materialized."
4988,2020-06-26 16:37:13,hg7nwt,"Really depends on where they‚Äôre coming from and who their social circle is. 

If they‚Äôre coming from Europe, there‚Äôs a good chance that they‚Äôll be pretty socially progressive. Coming from Africa, South America, or Asia, definitely less progressive but if they start associating themselves with other minorities, they are likely to get sucked into progressive leanings through peer pressure"

Between the ages of 18-30 I held down a steady job as a Restaurant Manager in a single restaurant. I can tell you from hard earned experience that JUST holding a steady job is NOT something that does more for a person's well-being (the resulting depression and suicidal/murderous urges from the position I was stuck in led to life-long medication and therapy) if they're not able to do something they want to do.

We're going to die of climate change at this point since we won't be able to significantly cut our carbon/methane emissions in time. That's not nihilism- That's reality. 

The only option left at this point is to try to prepare your community the best that you can and hope that everyone can make it.

You think that just because we‚Äôre all gonna die later, we can‚Äôt make some things better now. It‚Äôs a ridiculous pseudo centrist argument. The world is doomed if trump wins again, the rise of alt right normalization will continue, along with more climate deniers, plus, letting his outrageous authoritarian actions like invoking the fucking national guard on peaceful protesters is irresponsible and will lead to a suppression of our freedom of speech. Right now, cuz of all the centrists, Biden is winning, and when that happens, trump falls back on his alt right fan base, with comments about jailing people for burning the flag and whatnot.

>Why do they have to have specific politics you agree with to be vote worthy? Do you no feel like you should mitigate damage?

I'm part of a demographic both candidates detest, or at the very least, couldn't give two shits about. 

Mitigating damage for me in politics means direct action, not electoralism. 

Because it'll be bad for me either way. 

Like, at best, people will go back to holding their shitty beliefs but, instead of spouting it off openly, they'll mutter it under their breath. 

Because of their outward civility, most of the population won't give a shit about fighting for civil rights since they don't have to see the ugliness firsthand. 

Then it'll be back to murdering people like me and everybody going, ""Oh how terrible"" over dinner and then returning to go watch their daily sitcom or whatever the fuck else. 

At least Trump enrages people into action and takes shit that's been going on for centuries out in the open so people can no longer ignore it. 

I talk about my experiences and people actually care and believe me now compared to just a few months ago. 

That's not to say I'm voting for Trump. I'm not suicidal or stupid. 

My vote is going to a third party until people like me are represented in politics with at least some kind of policy. 

Otherwise, they can both kiss my ass. I'm fed up and done. I'm no longer settling for scraps nor lesser evil. Parties and politicians will have to actually earn my vote now."
5084,2020-07-04 08:03:03,hipuwh,"Idk man, fuck it, do what you want, I just think it‚Äôs naive to think that we can get politicians to change anything by saying they‚Äôll have to earn our votes. As long as a centrist majority exists, and the capitalist influencers for the politicians exists, our ‚Äúradical‚Äù views mean jack shit to them. In the next four years we‚Äôll probably be in the same situation, and if people keep doing this nothings going to change. Though that‚Äôs assuming something will change if Biden‚Äôs elected, which it definitely won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a bad situation but we have to start somewhere right?

5085,2020-07-04 08:19:00,hipuwh,">our ‚Äúradical‚Äù views mean jack shit

I'm not even talking about being a leftist. 

If I was a white cis straight leftist, then I'd probably vote for Biden due to the whole ""lesser evil"" philosophy. 

No, I'm talking about basic bare human rights for people like me. Nothing even super crazy radical. Shit I can get most libs around me to agree with. 

A voting bloc, like the African American population, is enough to demand change. The democrats literally only wield power due to minority votes and the biggest minority is vkaxk people. 

If a significant portion of black people stop voting Democrat and vote third party (demonstrating that they could vote Democrat but chose not to) then the Democratic party would actually feel pressured to cater to those votes in order to get power back and win elections. 

Unfortunately, someone has to go first to start that trend. I'm volunteering myself. 

But not just as a black man but as a queer man and a trans man as well, especially considering that Democrats think the best way to handle trans rights is by writing up informal ""guidelines"" that can be thrown away by the next republican to come along (thanks, Obama) or raise awareness by going to Times Square on the Transgender Day of Remembrance instead of making police actually investigate our murders (thanks, Warren). 

As for ""starting somewhere"", all I can say is that [James Baldwin is my spirit animal](https://youtu.be/MK2KrJTsZ2k)

My strategy is what it's always been: Direct action to protect my own community since it's literally the wild west out here for people like me. 

Until electoralism starts offering me the bare fucking minimum (as a minority, not even as a fucking leftist), then it's automatic third party vote. 

And that's not my fault. There's been plenty of time for this shit to be addressed. 

All I can say is that, when Biden gets elected and things ""go back to normal"", remember that all this horrible shit you see now has always been happening: Cops killing people, trans people being murdered, queer people being harrased and killed. 

And don't go back to sleep."

...and it seems to make it clear that Biden is referring to racial tensions rising over time until they explode. Basically arguing that by integrating society -- wisely, back then -- that they could prevent such explosions later.

If you read the full text of his comments [which is on page 251 here](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112104078842&view=1up&seq=255) it is clear that he is talking about managing an ""orderly integration of society"" and felt that he had to defend the bill's constitutionality, as written.

5177,2020-06-30 17:47:32,hip66r,"> Sadly the dnc

FYI: This ''blame the DNC for any outcome I don't like"" thing isn't based in reality.

There is not now, nor has there ever been, any evidence that the DNC sabotaged Bernie's 2020 campaign.

There *was* a plan to undermine Bernie *in 2016*. It was done in the open. The [DNC chair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Wasserman_Schultz#Resignation) had endorsed Clinton. She did things like schedule debates opposite major sporting events to drive down viewership numbers; the aim was clearly to stop anyone but Hillary from getting any traction. That was an actual DNC plan -- supported by actual evidence -- to boost Clinton and hurt any/all of her challengers.

In fact, there is [evidence](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/31/dnc-superdelegates-110083) that the DNC *intentionally leveled the playing field* for the 2020 race:

>Conversations about a potential rules change picked up as Sanders ascended in the primary, but they have not gained traction to this point within the DNC...

>""[DNC Chairman] Tom Perez fought tooth and nail to ensure our nominee would be chosen by pledged delegates, not automatic delegates,‚Äù David Bergstein, a DNC spokesman, said in an email...

>**The rule change was widely viewed as a major victory for the Democratic Party‚Äôs left flank.** At the time, Perez called the delegate overhaul ‚Äúhistoric,‚Äù while progressive Democrats and many moderates lauded its appeal to young voters skeptical of centralized party power.

This time, the DNC chairman clearly understood that the best thing for the party would be if everyone trusted that the nomination process was above board, and blocked any efforts to rig it. That serves as evidence that it *was not* rigged.

#There is zero evidence of the DNC taking any action to deny Sanders the 2020 Democratic nomination.

Suggesting otherwise is baseless conspiracy theorizing, and should be dismissed in any reasonable discussion."

But, that reason alone is more than enough of a reason to vote for him for a large percentage of the population. And the reason it's gotten that far is because of the sheer ineptitude, divisiveness, and consistent disregard of the truth that the current administration embodies.

5272,2020-06-30 18:35:36,hip66r,"Yeah, it certainly does! Like I said, arguments like these are super common in reinforcing segregationist policies- Richard Rothstein's ""The Color of Law"" goes into this super extensively in the front half of that book- segregationist laws and policies were generally upheld using two arguments:

1) That racial segregation is necessary to keep social order, or that eliminating existing segregation would cause unrest

2) That policies that lead to segregation aren't actually segregationist because they're based on some factor that strongly correlates with race rather than with race itself (e.g. you have to have a certain income, have moved from a certain other region that had more explicit segregationist policies, etc.). 

Greenberg actually gives a beautiful example of exactly this happening on the page before the one you cited when he talks about the Swan case's ""root and branch"" argument, and he makes a few allusions to this same sort of policy a few times on the preceding pages, to which Biden replies that that's legal precedent. He also does so a few pages before when he cites the Spengler case, which wasn't ruled as segregation because it didn't have explicit racial intent, and yet it still caused segregation. Which is certainly true! It's also not exactly a secret that those laws reinforced *de jure* segregation.

I think it's very important when you analyze this bill that you understand what *de jure* segregation in the US historically looked like. It looked almost exactly like the arguments that Biden makes here. He even goes to pretty substantial lengths to try to argue that this \*isn't\* racially motivated in a pretty defensive way- he says people have compared his support for this policy to both George Wallace and Robert Byrd, and that the witness he's currently talking to is the only person who hasn't told him to his face that this isn't explicitly racist during this testimony.

Honestly, I don't know how this context makes you think that this statement is \*less\* racist, when it shows Biden using the same defense as explicit segregationists, remarking on how often people have already used this bill to compare him to explicit segregationists, and somehow, even though Mr Greenberg explicitly tells him that he thinks this bill is intended to make it harder for school desegregation to proceed, Biden comes to the conclusion that the guy is being amicable for not explicitly calling him a racist like everybody else in the hearing has.

I read that as Biden knows what he's doing is racist, is using the same line of argument as racists, is mad that people have called him out for it, and is using a slightly less mad commentator to awkwardly try to put up a defense that this totally isn't racist, guys- I'm not segregating schools, I'm preventing ""racial tensions!"" And it's not unconstitutional because it doesn't have explicit racial intent!

I don't think this leaves room for Biden to claim either ignorance or good intent with bad results."

5282,2020-06-30 20:20:07,hip66r,"How do you even reconcile this logic in your head. Trump supporters always find a way to project I suppose.

""he constantly criticizes people and refuses to take responsibility for past actions."" Give me a fucking break dude. This is literally the MO of Trump - who consistently fights with people on social media over frivolous issues and blatantly lies to the American public about things he has said and done ON CAMERA.

""we all know he assaulted Tara Reade and I guarantee there's more victims of his."" We don't know that, he was accused with no definitive evidence. At least 26 women have come forward to accuse DT of sexual assault, including a woman named Katie Johnson who claimed Trump raped her when she was 13 years old at a party with Jeffery Epstein. She had to drop her case in 2016 due to death threats. You sit there and speculate ""I guarantee there's more victims of his"" and I've seen people accuse Biden of being too ""Touchy Feely"" when Trump is ACTUALLY A CREDIBLY ACCUSED PEDOPHILE AND SERIAL RAPIST.

Heres the deal for those of you who are clearly politically illiterate. A vote for Biden is not just a vote for a single person, its also a vote for his entire future administration, full of secretaries, advisors, diplomates, directors, chiefs of staff, etc. Trump has proven that he is unwilling or unable to accept the advice of experts, be it public health, military/foreign policy, economics, not staring at the fucking sun during a solar eclipse, etc. In fact, Trump has left so many positions vacant because he believes he doesn't need them as he sees himself as all knowings. This has been devastating to our collective health and wealth - ie the current recession and pandemic, a complete devestation of american farmers, especially soybean farmers, because of he needed to satisfy his ego with tariffs against china which achieved nothing in the end, the abdication of America's leadership in the world. Biden at least listens to those who know more than him and has even adjusted his platform after winning the nomination to engage the progressive left. Biden is definitely not my first choice, but Trump and Biden are not the same."

Still...it is arguments like this one that I find compelling:

>‚ÄúLet me explain something to you about Joe Biden and why some of the shit that he‚Äôs done in his past doesn‚Äôt matter.  This old rich white man played second fiddle to a black man.  Not just any black man, but a younger black man, a smart black man.  Not just for a day.  Not 1, not 2 but eight years.  He took his cues from this black man who had more power than him and was virtually unknown when he took the presidency and Joe Biden had been around forever.  He was willing and proud to be his wing man.  Not once did he try to undermine him, this black man.  Instead Joe walked in lockstep with him, he respected him, he loved and trusted him.  He was lead by him and learned from him.  And Joe did not have a problem with it.  You tell me what 40+ year ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù white politician has ever done that.  Joe Biden is cut from a different cloth.  And black folks understand that and for good reason.  He has shown it.  This is what showing up and being an ally looks like.  When black people say they know Joe, this is how we know.‚Äù

I mean sure, just a few weeks ago, he aggressively defended it.  But he‚Äôs probably .. maybe .. I dunno .. changed his mind in the past few hours?

He‚Äôs really a good guy once you get to know him:

Raining down bombs and sending out drone strikes against black and brown people overseas.

Vehemently promoting a southern ‚Äòwall‚Äô at our border with Mexico, while mentioning that Mexicans ‚Äòbring diseases into the United States‚Äô at a fundraiser just a few years ago, where he was caught in video.

Promoting segregated schools using cool terminology like ‚Äòjungle‚Äô to describe schools where black kids are allowed to go to school with white kids.

for entirely unrelated reasons, with less than 1% difference between the total votes between hillary and trump, i'm for sure advocating for at least 5% of the voting population to defect from voting democrat, and instead try to swing the vote to trump and hope he follows the rule of law and gives the green party federal money to run against his heirs next election cycle."

I'm not sure if it's necessary to wait until after the election tbh, I mean the current protests have already proved to be somewhat effective at gaining concessions (with the officers involved being arrested and all) and bringing issues further forwards in the discourse.


And yeah I can understand that view, but in all honesty, I'd say if Bush didn't tarnish the US' reputation more with a completely fradulent war that left countless dead then that reputation seems to be based purely off aesthetics rather than actual policy. Not sure what that says really, but it's an interesting phenomenon. I'd say perhaps that calls for a big change in the way we look at politics, but it does feel increasingly like aesthetics are becoming a _more_ important part of politics, and this makes sense I suppose with the increasing 'gameification' of it all if you like.


As for the discourse, this is an issue I'm a little undecided on tbh but I think Felix Biederman had an interesting take on it which is worth considering. He's a comedian/political commentator but I think he's got half decent political instincts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mUq5udrHPM

it was *Biden*    who was among the principal and earliest movers of the policy agenda   that would become the war on drugs and mass incarceration, and he did    so in the face of initial reluctance from none other than  President     Ronald  Reagan. Indeed, Reagan even vetoed a signature  piece of  **Biden legislation, which he drafted with arch segregationist Sen.Strom Thurmond** of South Carolina, to create a federal ‚Äúdrug czar.‚Äù

The Biden-Thurmond bill increased penalties for drugs, including    expanding  **civil    asset forfeiture; created a sentencing commission; and eradicated    parole at the federal level. It sought to limit access to bail** ‚Äî a provision denounced by the ACLU for **‚Äúrevers\[ing\] the  presumption of innocence.**

Biden sponsored not just the bill limiting courts‚Äô power but also an [amendment to an appropriations bill](https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/18/archives/anti-busing-measure-approved-in-senate.html) that barred the federal government from withholding funding from schools that remained effectively segregated.

The   **amendment went beyond the busing issue**, **affecting   school systems that  effectively separated students by race whether or   not they used  busing.Co-sponsors included segregationist Sens. Jesse   Helms,  R-N.C.,  and Strom Thurmond, R-S.C**

**Biden    not only supported but aggressively  pushed for a    conservative,anti-working class bill that made life a lot harder for    that family**  that he talked about. Here's a little of the background:

***The  financial services industry*** *began seeking* ***relief from Congress*** *in the    mid-1990s* ***from an increase in bankruptcies that was cutting into its    profits***. Its initial ***support*** *came from Republican lawmakers, who    repeatedly introduced bills to make it more* ***difficult for consumers to    erase their debts***.During    that time, executives at MBNA, which was bought in 2006 by Bank of    America, began donating heavily to both major political parties and many    national politicians, including Mr. Biden.

*Consumer advocates say that* ***Senator    Biden was one of the first Democratic    leaders to support the    bankruptcy bill, and he voted for it four times ‚Äî in 1998, 2000, 2001    and in March 2005, when its final version passed the Senate by a vote of    74 to 25.***

**Private     student loans were largely stripped of bankruptcy protections in  2005   in a congressional move that had the devastating impact of  tripling    such debt over a decade and locking in millions of Americans   to years    of grueling repaymen**ts.

**Biden    issued a press release bragging that he was ""one of the  Senate's    most  conservative Democrats."" As proof, he cited his votes to     restrict    abortion & pass the Social Security-cutting balanced    budget  amendment**.

Day  after day, Scotto walked into Biden‚Äôs sanctum and convinced him to    up  the ante, **asking for billions of dollars for 100,000 police officers**,   which in turn required a  major expansion of prisons across the  country.‚Äú**There wasn‚Äôt one thing when he said, ‚ÄòNo,‚Äô**‚Äâ‚Äù Scotto  recalled in an interview.**Scotto,** however, was not a member of Biden‚Äôs  staff.

Ritter,      in the run up to it, loudly  made the case against war, arguing  that    the  WMD claims were  overhyped.Biden  had reason to disbelieve  the  WMD    claims. In a  classified hearing on  September 24, 2002, at  the   urging  of  a staff  member, **Biden asked  then-CIA Director George Tenet what evidence of WMDs the U.S. had  ‚Äútechnically collected.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúNone,  Senator,**‚Äù       Tenet said, according to an account in the book ‚ÄúHubris,‚Äù by     Michael    Isikoff and David Corn. Biden, wondering if there was some     highly    classified evidence, asked Tenet, **‚ÄúGeorge, do you want me to  clear the staff out of the room?**‚Äù Tenet told him no. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no reason  to, Senator.‚ÄùLater in that same hearing, **Biden heard from two  government witnesses who rejected the ‚Äúaluminum tubes‚Äù claim that had  been circulating**, and would later become a centerpiece of Secretary of  State Colin Powell‚Äôs presentation to the United Nations.

**Yet        during the summer 2002 hearings, Biden claimed that ‚Äúone thing is        clear, these weapons must be dislodged from Saddam Hussein,**    or    Saddam  Hussein must be dislodged from power.‚Äù Given that he  was     already  on  record believing that the weapons could never   effectively    be  dislodged  from Saddam Hussein, that left only one   option: war. **Biden voted for the  Iraq war resolution on October 11, 2002, three weeks after hearing from  Tenet in the classified session.**

Also keep in mind he, to this day, vilifies the exonerated Central Park 5 and refuses to issue a retraction on his demand for their execution. He still believes they are guilty. I wonder why? The guy is a racist through and through. 

And if we expand to racism against non-black minorities, the list gets really long. [Here is a summary.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_views_of_Donald_Trump)

This particular quote stands out to me as pretty objectively racist.

Nobody else... Besides that, I tell you something else. I think that's guy's lazy. And it's probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks.

5501,2020-06-30 16:54:59,hiofwn,"I generally answer on my phone, so instead of answering specific questions I'm going to split it between the offense and the defense of my opinion of the US president, and hit some of the points after.

Offense: I don't love Donald Trump. His inability to take responsibility is very aggravating. He's blunt and sometimes divisive. For better or worse he speaks his mind, which leaves him stating, retweeting, or otherwise displaying some seriously foolish quips.

Defense: I don't hate Donald Trump. He's a man who would fight to the last breath if he feels it's the right thing to do. Much of his stupidity is a companion the the trait of endurance. The guy just won't back down. He works hard to connect with people, many whom literally camp overnight to come see him speak. 

Trump doesn't do a great job representing me, but that's because the republican party doesn't do a good job representing conservatives in the modern United States. As far as golfing goes, if he thinks golfing with world leaders will build a better relationship, then so be it. With tweeting? Jesus, it boils my blood. It's great that he has a way to communicate with his base, but he needs to be more careful."
5502,2020-06-30 18:25:55,hiofwn,"I think he's kind of performative and silly.  I don't know if he has any strong principles.  But he's somehow less objectionable than belligerent leftists and the cultural forces they represent.  

About 70-80% of what he does is standard GOP policy, and I'm on board with most of that.  I like how agressively he has staffed the lower courts with conservative judges. I'm not a fan of his apparent ad hoc approach to issues.  Seems more reactive than proactive.  


I'm bothered by the nepotism, but I'm desensitized to this type of thing in politics. 


I honestly like Trump as an entertainer/television personality.  It's not traditionally presidential, but he's a radical personaility in the spirit of our radical times.

I'll need examples of Trump not taking responsibility here.  


I am a little bothered by his associate turnover.  It suggests that Trump surrounds himself with a cult of personaility.  But other presidents have had people come and go, too.  So I'm not sure how unique Trump is there.  

I think he should get off of Twitter.  Not because of time spent there, but time everyone else has to spend dealing with the fallout of him carelessly retweeting stuff like a white power chant in part of a video.

I like that Trump is willing to punch back, but I think while he's in office, he should be more tactful.  The cognitive dissonance between his public fueds and position is a bit much.

Sex scandals?  I don't care.  

I'd vote for many other conservatives over Trump in a legitimate primary, but they would have no realistic chance to win vs someone who a solid incumbent with the GOP base. 

Does Trump represent me well?  Not really.  I'm a movement conservative, and he doesn't fit neatly into that box.  He's more of a populist, ala Pat Buchanon.  That's not my cup of tea."
5503,2020-06-30 17:45:07,hiofwn,"
1. What are your honest thoughts about the current President of the United States?

He‚Äôs a celebrity whose gimmick is that he‚Äôs an unlikable businessman.  I find him to be an unlikable businessman. 

2. Which of his policies do you support, and which of them do you disagree with?

I support the wall in terms of curbing the illegal flow of immigration into the country. I generally support his conservative policies and disagree when he takes a liberal stance on a social issue seemingly judged by an emotional response to current events rather than following a code or philosophy if he has one at all. 

3. Does it bother you that he keeps putting friends and family members in important government positions?

Yes

4. Do you like his personality, or do you think it's unsuitable for his position?

I do not generally like the characters Trump portrays himself as in the celebrity world. I don‚Äôt believe, however that his personality is relevant when judging his viability as president. 
 
5. How do you feel about the way he seems to avoid taking personal responsibility?

I would like some examples

6. Does the fact that he keeps hiring and firing new cabinet members bother you?

I like to look at them on a case-by-case basis and most if the cases seem justified and well-within his authority. 

7. Do you think he should spend as much of his time as he does on tweeting and golfing?

I would have preferred if he stopped tweeting as much the moment he got into office, but it doesn‚Äôt matter.  I do not agree with his golfing habits and I think they should be dropped from his weekly schedule. 

8. Do you think it's befitting a man of his status to actively engage in celebrity feuds and twitter fights?

If you mean by the traditional notion of President, no, of course not. But he built his character to be one that engages in celebrity feuds and twitter fights to which the people on-masse responded to. 

9. Does his numerous sex scandals bother you?

The only thing I can think of was of a pornstar and that was about it. If you‚Äôre talking about the allegations of child rape then the conversation ends with evidence. Not entirely ‚Äúnumerous‚Äù if you ask me, especially given his celebrity status

10. Is there a Republican candidate you would prefer over him, or are you glad that he's the man running this time around?

I prefer a candidate whose character is more subdued than Trump‚Äôs but as long as my core values and issues that I vote for are addressed I do not mind supporting him. 

11. Do you feel like he represents the Republican party well?

No. He‚Äôs an outsider who ran as an independent which was the entire shtick of the campaign. As a nay-sayer to the established culture of politics of course he doesn‚Äôt represent the Republican party outside of his policies. An argument can be made that he did change the culture of the party, but that‚Äôs a different story. 

12. Do you feel like he represents **you** well?

He represents my interests and my  values. As a figurehead of the country entirely based on outward apperance I believe we certainly can do better, but I vote my elected leaders based on their policies and not character. 

**Disclaimer**: I‚Äôm a South Korean-American and I‚Äôm mostly conservative with rarely any liberal viewpoints. I do not care much about Trump and I believe the perceived value and role of the president (and any other elected politician) is overtly exacerbated by society and the media. I believe that most of what any elected leaders do rarely if ever affect the common citizen, and I believe that Trump‚Äôs victory was the one saving grace for saving America to forever be plunged into the establishment with little chance of escape. If you are reading this OP i thank you for being curious about the other side and taking the time to read my response. I would ask that next time you would refrain from adding seemingly loaded questions; or add context."
5504,2020-06-30 15:44:09,hiofwn,"1. A president that condemns the media for its propaganda is great in my book; if a president does nothing to oust propagandists from power, I suspect very bad things: he is in cahoots with the media, while they legitimize him as an outsider candidate, OR he has been compromised for trying to punish bad actors. 
2. I support his promise of building a wall with every intention to curb illegal immigration, human trafficking, drug smuggling, etc. I do not support an immigration system which creates a pool of foreign workers who seek to compete with homegrown talent or fill vacant menial jobs; the simple solution is raise the wages for those jobs. 
3. Yes, the Kushners bother me. Their positions of power are unprecedented. If I poke around long enough, I bet all sorts of slime come oozing out, starting with Charles.
4. Personality is not what compels me to choose; vision, ambition, and results do. 
5. American presidents of the last few decades are unique in that they have corporate boards, oligarchs, and bankers leering over their shoulder. Do you have any leeway as president when the stage has been set for you?
6. I wonder all the time if it's Trump's decisions. A prime suspect would be someone who axes members who don't align with his/her foreign policies.
7. I'm definitely an outlier when I say that Trump isn't the only one using his Twitter handle. 
8. Twitter should be purged for the cesspool of neurotic influencers that it is. 
9. Yes, sex scandals bother me; thankfully, most of the Weimar style degeneracy confines itself in Liberal areas, but the Internet has made this accessible in the dark fringes of social media. 
10. I don't support the current system as it is now, but Pat Buchanan would be a proper candidate. 
11. There is no saving this party without major cultural changes. The national composition and political ideology shifted too far to the left.
12. Not at all."
5505,2020-06-30 18:58:00,hiofwn,"Watching him go after China, North Korea, and Europe is satisfying."
5506,2020-06-30 14:56:22,hiofwn,"He's crude, vile, and unsophisticated and I'd never allow him in my house if he knocked.  But he does what he's elected to, make conservative policy decisions. I support him pulling out of Paris and TPP and trying to get us out of NAFTA. I do not support his ban of ""bump stocks"" and his handling of COVID-19. I'll vote for him again this fall because the alternative is voting for Biden who will make liberal policy decisions like trying to take my guns and appointing liberal justices."
5507,2020-06-30 19:40:15,hiofwn,"1. You outline these below in more detailed questions, so I'll just answer those and that will answer this.

2. The most shaky view I had was on trade and criminal justice reform but overall I am supportive of Trump's agenda. 

3. I dislike Kushner but no generally it does not bother me. 

4. Yes. 

5. If this is in reference to the coronavirus he was very right to say that was not personally his fault just any other natural disaster will not be his fault. The only person to blame is xi for purposefully inventing it. 

6. No because it's something I thought was unique to Obama but it turns out to be a fairly common thing all around. 

7. The only thing I have an issue with tweet wise is that he retweets too much, if he wrote all of his tweets personally like he did from the start then no issue. 

8. Yes. Politics is downstream of culture. Celebrities are major cultural figures whose reach has only grown with the rise of Twitter. It's a sad state but that is how it is. If celebrities want to get political then they get criticized. Bush being unwilling to do that cost him dearly in approval.

9. If Bill Clinton and JFK didn't exist then it would. Now it's just precedent that we hold you to. If they can do it in office trump can do it out of office. 

10. No. 

11. Yes he does represent the average blue collar Republican very well, he also represents the average rural voter. Upper class Suburban Republicans are less of a target of his message but they don't have much of a choice because they are not left enough to support socialism. 

12. Yes, but less so than he would have before March."
5508,2020-06-30 21:32:49,hiofwn,"Just a quick response on #7 that I haven‚Äôt seen anyone address. It seems people assume his golfing is a self-indulgent waste of time, but I think he works while golfing and more importantly is having ‚Äúoff-schedule‚Äù meetings with individuals on matters regarding national security and secret decision-making. I have no evidence for this, but with so many presidents constantly playing golf, there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôre just ‚Äúplaying golf.‚Äù"
5509,2020-06-30 22:21:57,hiofwn,"I love Trump! At the beginning I was somewhat skeptical, but he has been proven right on every single issue that he has confronted, and at this point I trust him enough to go with him pretty much anywhere he wants to go. I was skeptical of his anti-immigration positions, but it is clear now the extent immigration is being used by the wealthy to increase corporate profitability at the expense of American jobs. I was also skeptical of his anti-China position, but once again he has been completely vindicated. It is clear now that China has bought most of our political figures, and they have completely sold out the American citizens.
With regards to his hiring and firing, I think you have to trust your chief executive, we simply don‚Äôt have enough information to second-guess his choices. I can understand him wanting family members involved, because he can trust them, and the majority of people in Washington are complete scumbags. I thoroughly approve of his hiring and firing everybody else, you have to trade people out and then get rid of all the bad eggs. Fortunately Trump isIs really quick and decisive about that, and replaces bad people with new ones.
I thoroughly approve of everything else on your list, with the exception of his cheating. Well I don‚Äôt approve of this, nobody‚Äôs perfect, and I think all of his other Great qualities outweigh this personal shortcoming."
5510,2020-06-30 23:11:06,hiofwn,"Donald Trump is a classic creative genius.

He does not play by the rules or get along with others, mainly because most of humanity is mostly self-deluded most of the time.

He put his finger however on our weaknesses -- immigration and China -- and has been saving us from those, instead of crusading against symbolic issues like the Gang of Nineteen were."
5511,2020-06-30 14:54:46,hiofwn,"President Trump is in practice more traditional on many issues than the conservative establishment, although I would not say he is perfect.

The reason I am voting for him and the reason I think all people who love liberty are probably obligated to support him is because he, unlike basically all other so-called conservatives, is willing to call out the poison of progressive thought and malice, and fight against it more than most without apology.

He might not be traditional, properly speaking, but he is the best chance we have to fight off the barbarians of the left enough to carve out a place where traditional values may be able to flourish. If Trump loses, I think serious Christians and those who recognize the nobility and necessity of traditional values will have no choice but to take what Alasdair MacIntyre calls the Benedict option. Just like the chaos and tyranny of the Goths, Huns, and Vangals prompted St. Benedict to produce local communities to preserve all the truth, good, and beautiful of Greek-Roman-Christian civilization from the barbarism running wild in his time, we might have to do the same against the madness of our times which is turning (or might have already turned) the American republic into the American empire. 

We might be at the edge of a dark age, and although it isn‚Äôt clear if Trump can ultimately fight off the cultural erosion caused by the left, which has infected us for the last 70 years or so, he might be able to keep it bay enough so that traditionalists more principled and talented might be able to begin healing the rot."
5512,2020-06-30 17:15:54,hiofwn,"1) He is doing the best that he can with no prior political experience and does not deserve the scrutiny he receives.

2) I love how he made hospitals more accessible to veterans and made animal cruelty a felony.

3) Why would he appoint someone he does not trust or know?

4) He is different, at times he is too vocal and needs to learn how to reserve himself.

5) Can you give an example?

6) He is a businessman, it is what he does best, why keep someone if they are not filling your standards.

7) Twitter is a great way to communicate directly with the public. 

8) Drama creates fame, and they can't stop talking about him. Everyone in the world knows his name now.

9) I do not know enough information about this but any sex scandal needs to be reviewed.

> 2. Which of his policies do you support, and which of them do you disagree with?

I support most of his policies.  I liked his response to the pandemic, unfortunately many in leadership positions seemed unwilling to take responsibility, leading to mismanagement at the state level.  His stance on regulations only helps the economy, as long as he doesn‚Äôt deregulate too much.

> 3. Does it bother you that he keeps putting friends and family members in important government positions?

No.  This isn‚Äôt unique to the Presidency, or Trump, and historically is a very common thing to do generally.

The position of President doesn‚Äôt require a certain personality, that‚Äôs just something people in government who will never be president say.

He‚Äôs taken responsibility before.  So without context, I can‚Äôt give a good answer.

No.  It‚Äôs actually uncommon not to go through multiple cabinet members.

I‚Äôm not sure what this is supposed to mean.  There isn‚Äôt a President in US history that has not had contentious relationships with the media and others.

> 9. Does his numerous sex scandals bother you?

As he isn‚Äôt currently engaging in any, not particularly, no.  I care about what he does as President.

> 10. Is there a Republican candidate you would prefer over him, or are you glad that he's the man running this time around?

I think Ted Cruz could have been a better classic Republican President, but I don‚Äôt think he could have survived what Trump has.

He needs to represent the office of the President.  As long as he does stuff I agree with, he‚Äôs fine.

5516,2020-07-01 02:11:00,hiofwn,"What are your honest thoughts about Donald Trump?

Finally, we have a president who isn‚Äôt a Mayor Quimby (Simpson‚Äôs). Meaning he isn‚Äôt just a robotic, used car salesman.  He speaks his mind.  You may not like his style, you may not like his attitude, but he‚Äôs not a wimp and he‚Äôs not going to beat around the bush.  Conservatives have been frustrated for years because we are constantly being hammered and made fun of in all forms of media.  Leftist think it‚Äôs just normal and reality, but we see it as an evil strategic brainwashing of the masses to destroy freedom.  Trump is the first president since Thomas  Jefferson who called out the media for what they really are.  

2. Which of his policies do you support, and which of them do you disagree with?

Many Americans feel as though we give a lot to humanity and continue to do so around the world. But, we also feel as though people around the world take advantage of our kindness and generosity. For the lack of a better word, they talk shit about us, but at the same time, take our money, blood, sweat and tears.  Having said that Trump‚Äôs America first policy is long over due.  I also like his Supreme Court pics and trade deals with China and renegotiating NAFTA and deregulation.  His economy has been outstanding but I guarantee the media will make it Trump‚Äôs fault instead of covid19.  There are many more but it‚Äôs difficult on mobile.  

3. Does it bother you that he keeps putting friends and family members in important government positions?

Nepotism isn‚Äôt always a bad thing.  Our founding fathers did the same thing and made some excellent choices.  The problem is putting people into positions that have no credibility, experience or education.  His kids and family have more executive experience than many executives.  I like them and I think they are qualified for any government position.  I‚Äôd trust them over a career politician any day.  

4. Do you like his personality, or do you think it's unsuitable for his position?

Sometimes it‚Äôs cringey but i am done with the polished, silver tongue, do nothing, no back none politician.  Done with it.   

5. How do you feel about the way he seems to avoid taking personal responsibility?

Don‚Äôt care.  It means nothing other than a victory for democrats.  We the people will have the final say.  

6. Does the fact that he keeps hiring and firing new cabinet members bother you?

Not at all.  I like it.  We have a problem with people never getting fired.  He doesnt have time sit there and argue with a subordinate.  If you‚Äôre not on board, gtfo. Think if you were in charge of a huge organization.  Would you want to constantly have to battle your direct reports or would you rather have people under you who will carry out your orders? 

7. Do you think he should spend as much of his time as he does on tweeting and golfing?

Yeah the golfing annoys me for optics, but I not really.  You think he turns important stuff away because he‚Äôs on the golf course?  Now if I were president, I wouldn‚Äôt take a day off in 4 years.  If elected again then maybe but 8 years a short amount of time to be wasting it on days off.  Also, i read his books well before he was a serious candidate and I always admired his work ethic.  He mentions in one of his books way before a candidate that he only needs 3-4 hours of sleep and works 16 hour days.  He‚Äôs a machine and works harder than any modern president.  


8. Do you think it's befitting a man of his status to actively engage in celebrity feuds and twitter fights?

Not really.  But I like that he just doesn‚Äôt take it either.  These celebrities only call out republicans so it‚Äôs about time we start fighting back.  


9. Does his numerous sex scandals bother you?

Does JFK? Does Bill Clinton‚Äôs? Actual rapist.  These two presidents did far worse than Trump ever did.   The answer is yes, it would be nice to have a perfect human being, but it also pisses me off that because he said women *let* him grab them, he‚Äôs supposed to a rapist?

10. Is there a Republican candidate you would prefer over him, or are you glad that he's the man running this time around?

No, we need him to save this country from leftist.  

11. Do you feel like he represents the Republican party well?

Not particularly.  Trump is more of a true independent.  

12. Do you feel like he represents **you** well?

Yes"

5521,2020-06-30 17:00:49,hiofwn,"1. I think he‚Äôs trying to do a good job but is having to jump a ton of hurdles in order to do so and he‚Äôs stumbled more and more as of late. 

2. Keeping the 2nd Amendment intact is probably the most important. Building a wall and massive deportations would have to be the one I disagree with the most. 

3. I‚Äôm not too concerned about that, he wants people that he can trust to handle things that he just doesn‚Äôt simply have the time to micromanage. As long as they do a good job I don‚Äôt see a problem. 

4. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of all of the things he says and does, but there are times when he‚Äôs refused political correctness and it‚Äôs exactly what needed to be said. 

5. Yeah I don‚Äôt know about this one. I think his justification may be that he‚Äôs constantly under extra scrutiny from most media outlets. He also has a huge ego and it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to be a little more humble. 

6. It does raise my eyebrows a bit. I do think since he‚Äôs new to politics he‚Äôs learning who he can trust and who he can‚Äôt so it‚Äôs not too alarming right now. 

7. The tweets could probably be a little more articulate but that goes with a lot of things he says. As far as the golfing, if that‚Äôs how the man lets of stress then so be it. We all have hobbies, becoming President doesn‚Äôt mean sacrificing your humanity. 

8. Trump has always been controversial, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs changing who he is just because he became President. Once his time is up he‚Äôs returning to that world. 

9. Not really. I think if any had weight to them we‚Äôd see him in court.

5522,2020-07-01 00:39:16,hiofwn,"1. What are your honest thoughts about the current President of the United States?

President Trump is a mixed bag of good and bad policy mixed with great and aggravating rhetoric.

&#x200B;

2. Which of his policies do you support, and which of them do you disagree with?

There's too much to get into (too many policies), but I can summarize by saying deregulation, increased immigration scrutiny and a shift from Federal responsibility to State responsibility is a big plus. Negatives include propping up gov't subsidized industries, tariff policies, and a lack of clear messaging for other policies. I hate that President Trump often gives no clear or useful explanation for his decisions.

&#x200B;

3. Does it bother you that he keeps putting friends and family members in important government positions?

Not particularly. Every president puts some questionable people in positions of power, though it can be debated how much or how little power those ""preferential"" people have.

&#x200B;

4. Do you like his personality, or do you think it's unsuitable for his position?

When he's on his A game, President Trump is great. A strategic, cunning, comedic leader. When he reads off a script, he's fine. He has good speech writers, most of the time. And the fact that he agrees with these great scripts is refreshing, even if he reads a bit robotic. When Trump is doing what he's currently doing, just spouting random off-topic and annoying rants, I can't stand it. I agree that if he can't say the right things on Twitter, then he should resort to only listing economic trends on Twitter. His economy is great, only talk about unemployment and market growth.

 

5. How do you feel about the way he seems to avoid taking personal responsibility?

I disapprove. Humility is lacking in politics in general. He needs to do better. You probably don't know how anguishing and frustrating it is to have such a potentially great leader act in the ways he (sometimes) acts.

&#x200B;

6. Does the fact that he keeps hiring and firing new cabinet members bother you?

No. The President can do as he pleases, and we for sure don't know the internal politics of what's going on. I don't think it's good to have such volatility, but I don't know what actually goes on, so I remain neutral on the topic.

&#x200B;

7. Do you think he should spend as much of his time as he does on tweeting and golfing?

He should spend  time Tweeting about important issues, and showing how great things really are. For example, he should be reminding everyone how all the Democratic leaders of major cities praised Trump's administration for timely and effectively provided the COVID support they requested. But instead, he tweets some good things and many bad/petty things.

Golfing, who cares. Leaders need time for ""shower thoughts"", and a space to digest info. And a place to vacation. Every president ""wastes"" time with tax payer money. Trump isn't an anomoly.

&#x200B;

8. Do you think it's befitting a man of his status to actively engage in celebrity feuds and twitter fights?

No.

&#x200B;

9. Does his numerous sex scandals bother you?

No. Every prominent figure, especially the wealthy, have scandals and rumors. Not all is true, but it is certain the accusations are there. Judge leaders by their effect, not their past. A Perfect is elected for what he says he'll do; a President is not elected for being a perfect person.

&#x200B;

10. Is there a Republican candidate you would prefer over him, or are you glad that he's the man running this time around?

If he were on his A game, and more 2016-esque, then I'd be very happy. Right now, I'm not so sure. He's a terrible pick, judging on his rhetoric in June 2020. But he's much better than Biden. And I doubt other Republican candidates could compete in this environment of social activism and MSM bias. 

&#x200B;

11. Do you feel like he represents the Republican party well?

Yes. The Republican party has so many issues, and Trump does represent that ""good intention"" with a lack of follow-through. 

&#x200B;

12. Do you feel like he represents **you** well?

No. He needs to be articulate, conservative, and firm. He's always letting matters remain open when they could be shut and closed. For example, he should stand firm on allowing only single item bills. No omnibus bills that are convoluted and always end up wasting tax payer dollars. Such an easy, conservative, effective action that he just can't do.

&#x200B;

I'm very frustrated with him. But he's the best option we have right now."

Kennedy is revered by many, including myself, but I can't help but feel that he'd get slaughtered in the media over his womanizing if he was alive today (or just politically relevant).

Bill on the other hand is reviled by most progressives, and they even go as far as calling him a rapist. Other examples of contemporary Democrats that've had their careers ruined over sex scandals would be Al Franken and Anthony Wiener, while guys like Roy Moore seem to get off fairly easily.

It looks to me like the modern Democrats are much harder on their own for sexual indiscretions than what the Republicans are.

Consent doesn‚Äôt make an act just, nor does it make it worth doing, and the concept breaks down once we move away from those relatively equal in authority, wealth, and status.

The problem with the novel ideology of mere consent is that it makes the hook up the paradigm of sexual activity instead of the family reproduced from marriage. We no longer respect the will of our parents, especially the father in relation to his daughters, we no longer treat sexual activity is ordered by nature towards the creation of children (and the long term), we no longer see the value in abstinence and self-discipline, we no longer see the unique vulnerability that each sex has to each other, we no longer treat unconditional vows with much seriousness, our passion has made us violent against anyone who would limit our ability to act upon what we happen to desire, etc. And this culture is in the long term especially leads and has led to the unraveling of the fabric of the individual, the family, the community, and society, especially in the long term.

I mean, we are literally so stupid as to think that relations between two men or two women are qualitatively the same as relations between a man and a woman, and that gender can be indefinitely many things.

I think homosexual relations habituate our sexual desires away from the opposite sex, and in this way contradict the actual object of our desire, whether or not we recognize this to be the case.

One issue I have with the ideology that is conflicting with traditional sexual mores is that it treats our appetites and emotions as something we have the power to determine in a way we do not. We do not have the power to determine the general object or end for which our desires and emotions arise. We cannot refuse to recognize that there is an aspect of ourselves that we cannot determine but have to presuppose and work with in our self-determination. Artists don‚Äôt have the freedom to use a color that doesn‚Äôt exist.

I think sexual attraction to the same sex arises, like other sexual ‚Äútastes,‚Äù from environmental factors and events in one‚Äôs family life and the relationships one has with their peers, both same sex and opposite sex ones, especially during adolescence, although I do think that some people are predisposed to homosexual attractions, such as having a personality high in neuroticism. I have also speculated that homosexuality is an expression of some deeper desire that I cannot see or articulate well.

Civil marriage institutionalizes the relationship that serves as the source through which families reproduce. Because of this, it is foolish to raise same-sex couples to the same dignity or to establish a parallel one. I think imputing the same establishment to same sex relationships as opposite sex ones reduces heterosexual relationships conceptionally to the same kind of infertility that are inherent to homosexual relationships. By acting as if the pleasure of sex itself is the object of sexual desire, we have cut off sex from family and reduced the procreative relationship to the inherently non-creative one.

This doesn‚Äôt mean I think homosexuality behavior should be illegal and criminalized though. I think, as long as a society recognizes that the purpose of sex rests in the family and how homosexuality inherently conflicts with this ideal, that society can tolerate adults using their liberty to engage in these kinds of relations."
5554,2020-07-01 06:33:05,hiofwn,I encourage it.
5555,2020-06-30 23:13:01,hiofwn,"Thanks again for such a thoughtful and thorough reply, man!

I see where you're coming from, and you are making sense, but I have to say that I do still respectfully disagree. Relationships tend to be about a lot more than sex and carnal pleasure, especially when you get to the point of marriage, so I don't know that we can write homosexuality off that easily as a deviation of sexual tastes.

My best friend's a lesbian, and lately both she and her girlfriend have been working themselves to death and stressing out over all sorts of domestic stuff relating them moving into a new apartment together. What I'm saying is that I don't think my friend has gotten laid in ages, and she's a pretty cool chick who could have any (gay) girl in town if she liked, but she's still sticking by her lady with unflinching dedication. When I look at the two of them, it makes me a real believer in true love.

As for marriage being an important cornerstone of the family unit; I completely agree with you on that one. My parents were never married and both I and my siblings suffered severely from the instability that led to (though my parents shouldn't have been in a relationship, to begin with). However, I don't think that you need the family to have a father and a mother in it, just a paternal- and a maternal figure. The friend I mentioned earlier is kind of a ""tough guy"" lesbian (the short-haired kind that does rugby) so I think she'd make an excellent ""father"" for a very lucky child someday. And if they had a son, and they were in need of a man for some specific male advice like learning how to shave or how to deal with a bully or something, then they'll always have me for that. It takes a village; isn't that what they say?"

So believe the polls and fight like you‚Äôre the underdog."

5651,2020-07-01 01:47:29,himknt,"Maybe not Missouri, but he's already pouring millions into Ohio which he won by 8 points. For now this poll is an outlier, but it's not the first to at least show MO within single digits. That suggests serious trouble for Trump in, again, bluer states like MI/WI/PA. It means he can't just focus on holding onto those -- he has to first hold on to redder states like Ohio that he HAS to win to have a prayer. I'm not just talking about MO here, I'm looking at the larger picture. But yes if he actually is losing MO he's pretty much completely screwed no matter what.

All that said, while I seriously doubt Biden will win MO, crazier things have happened. Many times. First of all remember the state is relatively elastic and still somewhat purple-ish -- even as Trump won it by 18 points in 2016, Roy Blunt only won the Senate race by 2 points. Biden is seemingly a MUCH better fit for MO than Hillary was, based not only on these polls but also the primaries where he dominated there, and it seems to be the kind of state where individual candidates matter. 

Add on top of that, according to national polls we may be looking at a climate that is already as much as 10-12 points more Democratic than 2016 was. Then Biden only has to outrun Hillary by 4-6 points on top of that in MO to flip it. Not inconceivable in a landslide. Unlikely, but not impossible by any means. And again, not unprecedented. Look for instance at all the states that had HUGE swings from Clinton in 1996 to Bush in 2000, ironically Missouri among them. Also West Virginia, Louisiana, etc.

Keep in mind, even if this poll is off by 10 points, that STILL means Biden is doing 10 points better than Hillary. (-8 vs. -18)

EDIT: I really have no respect for people who downvote posts I put significant effort and thought into, and then they can't even be bothered to come up with a response. Again, I'm not saying it is at all likely Biden will win Missouri. In fact I said the opposite repeatedly. I'm just explaining what the implications of an even remotely close race in Missouri could be, and analyzing the outside shot scenario where it WOULD be up for grabs in a landslide. If you want to be willfully ignorant of all this, don't want to even consider the possibility, fine. I have no idea what you're doing on a PRO-Biden sub, then. If all you want to do is spread pessimism and petty mean-spiritedness to someone who frankly probably knows what he's talking about a lot more than you do, go somewhere else."

Especially telling someone to leave a sub rather than acknowledging a minor disagreement about an *opinion* of Trump‚Äôs campaign strategy based on polling numbers and political trends and assuming they downvoted you.  I hope this is not how you normally communicate with those in your life who you disagree with, because that is how you wedge division rather than trying to bring people together like Joe is trying so hard to do.  I hope you take this comment with respect, as I think it‚Äôs good to have civilized discussion with disagreement in subreddits of those with likeminded politics, and I‚Äôm sorry my non-response seemed to anger you so much."

The biggest problem is that while the state generally prefers the ""establishment,"" the Republicans in recent years have tended toward more ""anti-establishment."" If they were smart, they'd be running established statesmen and not shit-stirring Trump wannabes like Corey Stewart.

He will surround himself with competent people, not sycophants and inexperienced family members. He will listen to experts, and read all the relevant information.

Rice is that person. Her name on the ticket will pull the middle directly and with force that will wipe clean the Trump era. It will be the largest landslide victory in history. Put Harris as the head of Justice and clean house of the Trump corruption.  Here is the other thing announce now that there is going to be a huge house cleaning of the judges that were appointed.

I won't bash any, but FP experience is going to be essential in undoing some of the damage done by Republicans this last four years.  In four years, the VP could be the candidate for president.

I remember Sarah Palin as an anchor that helped sink John McCain's presidential run.  A bad choice reflects back to the person making the pick."
5690,2020-06-30 13:19:27,hilvor,"Elected experience is a two edged weapon.  Her experience qualifying her for role at the NSA is not high vis, but solid. You don't get picked for NSA leadership without that.... well at least not before Trump.

I cannot hear Benghazi over the widespread Russian, Chinese, Saudi/Middle East, and every despot that Trump and the GOP got in bed with.  The GOP is working with a rusty saber and glue-factory bound steed comparatively speaking.

You see no upside, I see no downside.  I look at Rice's viability through a moderate, average voter lens and electability is paramount .  The traditional role is of a VP being a person to reassure the base that the president is with them and allowing the Presidential candidate to campaign to the middle.  Biden's age vulnerability will be less of a factor if average voters know that strong leadership is in the wings.

I also can make arguments for other VP candidates as being every bit as good in different ways."

I think you don't realize how toxic Sanders was to the process, both as a candidate and based on his supporters.  His candidacy was rightfully seen as handing the election over to Trump, and it's no surprise that a bunch of people with no chance of actually winning the nomination got behind the guy who could."

I think Obama felt the same way and started making phone calls. Yes, that is politics. And so people dropped out, most likely for cabinet position guarantees.

5709,2020-06-30 12:34:42,hilvor,"I'm not arguing if it was good or bad, only time will tell. I just believe it would be healthier to have had these candidates campaign longer against each other. It would help bring out more issues that moderates and progressives want fixed and what their plans are to get things going in that direction. Perhaps, given the pandemic, having an early end to the campaign(s) might have been for the better."
5710,2020-06-30 16:36:39,hilvor,"I know. The common knowledge doesn't mirror reality.

There was a real concern about McCain being a RINO. Palin bolstered his credentials and made it safe for Republican conservatives to support him. Didn't get him across the finish line, but it kept it from being a historic blowout."
5711,2020-06-30 12:38:56,hilvor,"I felt more like Biden was almost out of cash and he and Bernie attacking each other was forcing Biden to spend money against Bernie AND it gave Trump fodder against Biden without spending the money himself. I realize there is a large gap between progressives and moderates, but hopefully we can work together to get things done as a team. I hated the Bernie/Biden, Biden/Bernie attacks."

Right-wingers are like depraved reptiles. They don't understand that adults are suppose-to love children. Reptiles and republicans wouldn't know that because they don't have love for any innocence.

This meme is a display of psychological projection on the part of a right-wing sock puppet. Republicans believe the only reason an adult would touch a child is in a sexual manner. Reptiles wouldn't even do that, but republicans do.

5746,2020-06-30 15:55:11,hijzxo,"I'm actually worried by the fact that Biden got the nomination. It's not ""pro Trump"" to say that Biden isn't capable of handling a debate. The man is just obviously not well. 

The VP pick is gonna have to be ^amazing^ to overcome Joe's shortcomings. 

""But Trump's senile too!"". Yeah, maybe. But go back and watch him in the debates from last election. He damn near made Jeb Bush cry. I would seriously feel bad watching Joe get roasted like that.

It makes me think we might have more crazy events coming before the election. Folks in charge already know that there won't be any debates. Might not even be an election. 

And what about ""Russian collusion""? I honestly think we've got some serious ""Chinese collusion"" going on right now. Look at their media holdings, including Reddit."
5747,2020-06-30 13:17:33,hijzxo,same can be said about trump
5748,2020-06-30 14:09:35,hijzxo,bruh so does trump he also has dementia ever seen the way he‚Äôs standing?? LMAOO
5749,2020-06-30 16:06:57,hijzxo,"Got any proof?

No. Of course you dont. 

Looks like someone crawled out from The_Donald."
5750,2020-06-30 11:24:04,hijzxo,So let‚Äôs hope his VP choice is able to step up and get the votes. Trump needs to go like yesterday!
5751,2020-06-30 17:28:09,hijzxo,"Ok, so as a Brit who knows a limited amount about US politics, isn‚Äôt it true to say that Trump is also either starting to show signs of some mental faculty degeneration, or perhaps an Adderall addiction? Like in [this video](https://youtu.be/C1lYWzz2zBw), starting at about 05:45, or [this one](https://youtu.be/gza7H3zG4g8)?"
5752,2020-06-30 18:13:15,hijzxo,Still time for an Independent candidate.
5753,2020-06-30 18:30:42,hijzxo,I'm sure that's the plan...
5754,2020-06-30 18:37:54,hijzxo,"will continue being the figurehead while the deep state runs the country for the next 4 years, you mean."
5755,2020-06-30 18:59:44,hijzxo,Nope - it's because hes actually been sentenced to death for drinking the adrenochrome of sexually abused infants and the footage we're seeing is merely CGI to cover it up until the messiah comes and dethroned the Queen of England.
5756,2020-06-30 21:08:58,hijzxo,"Have you \*heard\* many senators speak? Or old people in general?

He was on the news this morning live for about a half-hour (until I turned it off because who cares) and he sounds like every other corporate Democrat: slow-witted and careful not to offend his paymaster PACs. He has always been a mush-mouth and a terrible campaigner, which is why even with Obama's popularity coming out of the second term there was little talk about him even running. He has been running for president my whole life and all he's got is ""I rode the train"" and ""I had personal tragedy."" 

Trump is so weak electorally that they could run a hamster for president and win. As long as the hamster doesn't say much, and sorta lays back as the country continues to implode.

Biden \*announced\* early on that he would only serve one term because of his age, so it's not a conspiracy that the VP pick is going to end up being the ""incumbent"" nominee in 2024. It's part of the sales pitch."
5757,2020-06-30 22:14:25,hijzxo,"I dunno why this isn't a thing worldwide: psychological tests and exams that every president/prime-minister should do in order to take office. You must do this to a lot of things, why our leaders not?"
5758,2020-07-01 04:24:54,hijzxo,"I just lost my mom to dementia. Well, technically cause of death was pneumonia the type was aspiration, moderate to severe dementia went fast.

But yeah I remember what she was like at first for a few years, forgetful, pauses, mixed words, mixed days. I feel like when I‚Äôm seeing him speak I remember her in early dementia before I knew it was actually dementia."
5759,2020-07-02 04:23:26,hijzxo,"Yes, I agree. It is the most shameful abuse of an elderly."
5760,2020-06-30 15:17:20,hijzxo,We need to abolish the idea that young people cannot be in office or hold positions of leadership. Young as in mid twenties and such
5761,2020-06-30 16:46:31,hijzxo,"When Woodrow Wilson had a stroke the Vice President still didn‚Äôt do shit.  Same thing when Eisenhower had a heart attack.  Same thing when FDR had congestive heart failure.  Same thing when Grover Cleveland disappeared having his jaw replaced.  

We actually have a situation right now where the president is golfing and tweeting and he put the Vice President in charge of coronavirus which is our biggest governmental issue right now.  Trump is basically the first president to delegate such important work to the Vice President.  

Just sayin...  have a good day"
5762,2020-06-30 16:39:05,hijzxo,"imma still vote for Biden, because i think he (or most likely the VP & biden's team) would be better for the country than another 4 years of Trump being president."
5763,2020-06-30 14:02:51,hijzxo,Imagine thinking that whoever is president makes any actual decisions....wow. Sweet precious naive children...
5764,2020-06-30 16:02:52,hijzxo,He is out giving speeches all over the place now. He‚Äôs actually looking pretty good.
5765,2020-06-30 13:18:48,hijzxo,"We literally have a President in mental decline and your chief concern is about a candidate? Yeah, okay."
5766,2020-06-30 13:09:54,hijzxo,The Democrats really screwed up. No matter your views on trump he is very beatable. This year‚Äôs democratic race had a lot of solid candidates but instead they choose the establishment guy that can barely speak.
5767,2020-06-30 16:14:25,hijzxo,You gotta pick the shiniest of two turds.
5768,2020-06-30 17:28:36,hijzxo,And judging by the midterms the Dems has won
5769,2020-06-30 13:39:23,hijzxo,If you thought 2016 was the year for third parties then hooooooooo boy.
5770,2020-06-30 17:38:05,hijzxo,"You seem very optimistic that biden will win. I am not so sure it will happen. 

And no, my favorite sub did not get banned yesterday. I am a lifelong democrat. I just cannot see him winning right now. And I don‚Äôt care what the latest poll says. That will change every day until November anyway"
5771,2020-06-30 18:01:22,hijzxo,Hillary Clinton has entered the conversation
5772,2020-06-30 18:03:07,hijzxo,These comments. Yikes
5773,2020-06-30 18:19:52,hijzxo,So kinda like Dubya Bush
5774,2020-06-30 18:50:25,hijzxo,Believe he said something to that affect during a press conference when Michelle Obama was presented as a possible VP choice.  This was before Hillary was unequivocally shot down.  Believe he said something about the person needing a background in politics.  Took that to be pretty funny being that she was the First Lady.
5775,2020-06-30 18:53:09,hijzxo,"I kept getting a youtube ad where he blatantly skipped or slurred words that were in the subtitles, funny how I saw some people mention it and now I haven‚Äôt seen it"
5776,2020-06-30 19:54:56,hijzxo,"Either that or they want a puppet. Either way, it seems like we‚Äôre right back where we were 4 years ago with 2 very shitty choices for President. I‚Äôm at the point that I hope there‚Äôs a good running mate, but I doubt they‚Äôll allow that."
5777,2020-06-30 20:12:12,hijzxo,"i like that the other side always runs the worst candidate possible. Apparently, there is some blood transfusion treatment, which it looks like Biden recently had. 

Berny imo probably could have won but you can tell he's not actually part of the cult in Washington."
5778,2020-06-30 20:13:03,hijzxo,"If he gets Hillary as VP, he better get a good taster"
5779,2020-06-30 20:35:25,hijzxo,There‚Äôs always the 20 year presidents curse it is the year 2020
5780,2020-06-30 20:38:27,hijzxo,A good way to sneak Killary in
5781,2020-06-30 21:24:11,hijzxo,Weekend at Joe's
5782,2020-06-30 21:24:14,hijzxo,We've had our 1st black president...why not our first mentally handicapped potus
5783,2020-06-30 21:24:34,hijzxo,That's not even a conspiracy theory.
5784,2020-06-30 21:51:14,hijzxo,To those who think he clearly has dementia and the Dems are covering it up. Did you see his speech today? CNN carried it live. Not sure how long he spoke and answered questions but it must have been forty five minutes or so. Maybe an hour. He was a little slow a few times but nothing cringe worthy. No way could he keep that up and have the kind of cognitive deficits the Rs are claiming. He made sense too. Got in a few zingers. Seems really eager to debate. It‚Äôll be interesting.
5785,2020-06-30 21:55:37,hijzxo,"My boyfriend always  calls out his word slur in his youtube commercial, is that an indicator?"
5786,2020-06-30 21:56:06,hijzxo,Trump also is in poor mental health.  Don‚Äôt act like you‚Äôre all holiness is in good mental heslth
5787,2020-06-30 22:03:37,hijzxo,"Thank you! I‚Äôm glad someone said it. I mean he‚Äôs definitely got his quirks if someone smelling little girls hair while also confusing your sister for your wife can be considered quirks; but, aside from that he very obviously has something going on neurologically/psychologically- I support your theory, OP. But some people just want Trump out so badly that they‚Äôre willing to vote him in. Decisions, decisions."
5788,2020-06-30 22:04:26,hijzxo,But why would they not just get a proper democratic candidate who isn't a pedo and is well spoken? Confused here. If they want the best chance of winning... clearly Biden is not it
5789,2020-06-30 22:43:35,hijzxo,Wouldnt it be crazy if it was michelle obama
5790,2020-06-30 22:47:15,hijzxo,"Well, we've survived 4 years of Trumps obvious neurological issues, so it's not that worrying, surely."
5791,2020-06-30 23:02:05,hijzxo,"Agreed. I think trump is in only marginally better condition (or, rather, if he was quiet we‚Äôd notice faster) but imo they‚Äôre both way too old and I‚Äôm tired of seeing such older candidates getting picked and running"
5792,2020-06-30 23:19:36,hijzxo,"What I don‚Äôt understand is the fact that the presidency is a contract with the American people and military. In order to have a valid contract, you must be of sound mind and body. Joe Biden is neither!"
5793,2020-06-30 23:43:37,hijzxo,The 65+ people who wouldn‚Äôt vote for Bernie because he‚Äôs too ‚Äúold‚Äù
5794,2020-07-01 00:10:41,hijzxo,Why would people be worried about Biden becoming president if he is required to debate Trump?
5795,2020-07-01 00:25:50,hijzxo,Same goes for Dorito Mussolini
5796,2020-07-01 00:48:41,hijzxo,I pray to God he pulls Bernie back in this race.
5797,2020-07-01 00:59:26,hijzxo,"Yeppp, I‚Äôve been saying this for months. If he comes out of nowhere and selects Hillary Clinton we‚Äôll definitely know that‚Äôs the plan lmao"
5798,2020-07-01 00:59:33,hijzxo,Duh
5799,2020-07-01 01:12:05,hijzxo,Bet he decides after election and surprise bitches.. Hilary Clinton
5800,2020-07-01 01:23:31,hijzxo,"Yep, it was anything to get rid of Bernie. What a pathetic joke it is when a primary had preordained winners."
5801,2020-07-01 01:48:46,hijzxo,This is not a conspiracy. Trump is only 3 years younger and every quote from him is absolute word salad like stroke victims'. Stop the covert right-wing propaganda.
5802,2020-07-01 02:07:51,hijzxo,He performed better than I expected in the Bernie debate. I think both presidential candidates are too old and suffering from mental decline and unfit for service so it's going to come down to picking your poison.
5803,2020-07-01 02:12:58,hijzxo,"I don't have a problem with this, which is why I want the VP to be young."
5804,2020-07-01 02:54:34,hijzxo,The dems won win next election. Just impossible
5805,2020-07-01 03:25:34,hijzxo,Vote for me!
5806,2020-07-01 04:05:11,hijzxo,Hilary Clinton in blackface.
5807,2020-07-01 05:08:07,hijzxo,We‚Äôre going to have another four years of Trump.
5808,2020-07-01 06:40:08,hijzxo,That's pretty rich considering Trump.
5809,2020-07-01 08:03:49,hijzxo,He has a stutter and has had it for years. Beyond that i dont see any obvious signs of dementia with him while Trump fabricates complete fantastical stories on the regular (i'm sure you've seen the OG my uncle was a scientist one).  You also have to be either playing stupid out of malice or plain stupid to have the climate change policy that Trump is now running.
5810,2020-07-01 08:07:59,hijzxo,This is what everyone has been saying since forever
5811,2020-07-01 14:11:10,hijzxo,"I thought that Michelle Obama will swoop in to be VP and have Obama back in the White House too. Biden Obama 2020. Wouldn't that be something! But yeah, Biden is on an obvious decline. I don't know why they (aging politicians) don't just retire and enjoy life. Addicted to that life I guess."
5812,2020-07-01 15:57:03,hijzxo,That‚Äôs right. Whoever is the VP pick is is going to be the ACTUAL president
5813,2020-07-01 16:00:58,hijzxo,Michelle Obama is the deep States choice.
5814,2020-07-01 16:22:04,hijzxo,Weekend at Bernie‚Äôs
5815,2020-07-01 18:05:40,hijzxo,"What makes you believe Joe Biden will even win? I'm not voting for a potential pedophile. Have you seen the multiple videos showcasing how creepy Biden is?

5816,2020-07-02 10:04:17,hijzxo,"This is trump trying to win, he is just as old and and his dementia is real. Just try to make sense of what he says is dementia time 100..  So leave sleepy Joe alone, he can‚Äôt be worse then what we have now.."
5817,2020-07-18 01:02:11,hijzxo,The reall problem is we dont know who his running parter is.
5818,2020-08-12 13:21:25,hijzxo,Yes and the running partner is Camila Harris. This is frightening.
5819,2020-08-13 07:20:14,hijzxo,THIS IS ALL A PLOY TO GET A FEMALE PERSON OF COLOR AS THE US PRESIDENT.... KAMALA HARRIS WAS JUST NAMED BIDEN'S RUNNING MATE YOU WERE RIGHT YOU WERE CORRECT. ANDREW SCHULZ WAS TALKING ON HIS PODCAST ABOUT HOW DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO USE STRAIGHT WHITE MEN AS FRONTS TO GET WHO THEY REALLY WANT IN POSITIONS OF POWER. YOU WERE RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!
5820,2020-06-30 13:21:51,hijzxo,"in other words, someone whom nobody would vote for be next pres"

5826,2020-06-30 14:04:33,hijzxo,"I agree. It‚Äôs pretty bad. I was watching him yesterday and wondering... just what the hell does the Democratic Party have on him that obliges him to run in this state? He‚Äôs in bad shape. Biden is far from my favorite person, but I found myself almost moved to tears out of concern for him. Watching him get lost in thought... struggling to remember... saying the wrong things and not being able to recall what he meant to say.. the look of confusion on his face... it really makes me quite sad. He should be spending these days at home with his family, enjoying his retirement.

It also begs the question: who is the real candidate, and why won‚Äôt they have that person run instead? What are they hiding? I‚Äôve heard that it‚Äôs going to be Obama... but I doubt he can fulfill this position because he should be retired. Whatever it is, why the lack of transparency?"

5865,2020-06-30 19:58:30,hijzxo,"We need to raise the minimum age to hold any office. People are staying the mental age of adolescents way past the age of 25 these days. 

As for an upper age limit, there just needs to be a test to determine if the person is still competent or not."
5866,2020-06-30 18:57:54,hijzxo,"Exactly. We need to get rid of the impression that someone who's older is automatically wiser and better at running a country. Look at the Finnish president, she's 34 and doing a great job.
Also 70+ year olds don't understand younger people. Only a younger president is going to make any changes ever."
5867,2020-07-01 01:41:17,hijzxo,Yes
5868,2020-07-01 01:41:31,hijzxo,"Age? Just have them to take a test to proof they still capable. I'm sure our current president wouldn't have pass it. I wonder if Biden would. Age is so subjective, it shouldn't be a limittant."
5869,2020-06-30 17:36:44,hijzxo,Or remove the minimum age
5870,2020-06-30 19:50:13,hijzxo,"Right? Biden‚Äôs like, ‚Äú*VP*? I thought I was the VP?‚Äù"
5871,2020-06-30 18:44:01,hijzxo,LOL!
5872,2020-06-30 13:40:49,hijzxo,Underrated comment award.
5873,2020-07-05 03:59:07,hijzxo,I'm sure they will pick 'a good one' for him (whoever is pulling the strings)
5874,2020-06-30 14:32:15,hijzxo,Trying to choose which candidate to vote for in every presidential election is like trying to decide which socket to stick your fork in... The bottom or top one?
5875,2020-06-30 22:09:30,hijzxo,Reminds me of that Simpson's Halloween episode where they have to pick between the two aliens because no one wants to vote 3rd party.
5876,2020-06-30 13:05:58,hijzxo,As was 2016.
5877,2020-06-30 15:05:56,hijzxo,Don't forget they're both perverts as well.
5878,2020-06-30 17:59:24,hijzxo,"i think one has delusion and one dementia. 

Why cant the Americans have politicians who are young and pragmatic? 

Why is this a contest of old people?"
5879,2020-06-30 17:07:37,hijzxo,Which old racist with dementia and rape allegations do you want to lead your country?
5880,2020-06-30 17:56:48,hijzxo,"There's always Jo Jorgensen or my personal favorite, Howie Hawkins, though unfortunately people seem to forget about third party candidates that might actually have a better chance of making change in this country :')"
5881,2020-06-30 14:04:47,hijzxo,[deleted]
5882,2020-07-01 01:17:16,hijzxo,Voting in America has always been to make the choice between the lesser of two evils.
5883,2020-06-30 20:41:44,hijzxo,Why can't everyone realize we have more then two parties? Whats the reason of having a third party if no-one cares?. 2016 was the year where third party votes was at its biggest. It's a genuine question.
5884,2020-06-30 16:58:06,hijzxo,"I see it as Red Rapist v Blue Rapist. Red Rapist is actively trying to take away Civil liberties and human rights and OK keeping kids in cages at the southern border. The covid-19 debacle alone with this one... Such a fail. Blue Rapist would be a whole 'lotta nothing while we all fawn over the Obama years. Neither of these will bring true progress. What we need to ask ourselves is which one is demonstrably worse? To me, that's a no-brainer. Do I like it? No. That's why we all need to realise, neither Red Rapist nor Blue Rapist actually work for the people. Let's organize now and find candidates that actually will work for The People."
5885,2020-06-30 14:03:36,hijzxo,There is a third option.
5886,2020-06-30 18:43:01,hijzxo,2 pedophiles with dementia....
5887,2020-06-30 21:26:56,hijzxo,"> America has to pick between two people with dementia

Thankfully most people I‚Äôve seen are waking up to the bullshit that is the 2 party system. Vote gold everyone!"
5888,2020-06-30 14:26:02,hijzxo,"Is this actually a possibility? I hear people mention it but it seems absurd. Then again, 2020."
5889,2020-06-30 15:16:05,hijzxo,"I keep hearing this, would be cool to see. Couldn‚Äôt imagine the crying of the out and in closet racists though. Had them calling Obama the devil when they probably wanted to use a different word. But I liked how she was as the first wife, I think she could do it but it‚Äôs a stressful job so we‚Äôll have to see"
5890,2020-06-30 15:35:05,hijzxo,Kushner is the most powerful in the US
5891,2020-06-30 15:40:25,hijzxo,"SOMEONE HAD TO SAY IT! All I ever see is Trump Dicksuckers that point fingers to everyone BUT their Lord and Savior. Left, right, it doesn't matter they're all the same. The two wings are on the same bird, after all."
5892,2020-06-30 14:38:27,hijzxo,They don‚Äôt have names they are not corporations in all caps beholden to any government
5893,2020-07-01 00:34:22,hijzxo,Finally some sanity here!

5895,2020-06-30 15:50:19,hijzxo,"Jesus fucking christ. That would be incredibly stupid. So yeah, that's probably what the dnc will decide for him. The only people this will impress are the super woke who think her being part black negates her being a lifelong asshole. She doesn't give a fuck about the common person - black, white, brown, whatever. She put single moms in jail because their kids missed too many days of school causing many to get fired and lose their only source of income for the family, long history of siding with cops in court, referred to herself as California's top cop. What a great decision when police brutality/BLM is a top issue. Republicans could turn people against her by just reading her resume out loud.

The dnc fucks itself in the ass once again."
5896,2020-06-30 15:29:53,hijzxo,"Yeah it‚Äôs too bad because if she‚Äôs AG then all the fucking people like Trump, Kushner, Flynn, Barr, Cohen Lewindinski, and all the others will be locked up if she is AG."
5897,2020-06-30 17:16:37,hijzxo,Yep
5898,2020-06-30 14:40:46,hijzxo,"Has it ever occurred to you it‚Äôs on purpose? Trumps been in Hollywood long enough to understand the average person is not very smart, he talks and writes at a 4th level to appeal to everyone."
5899,2020-06-30 17:37:51,hijzxo,All politicians are old out of touch fools but I'd still take trump over a man with severe mental illness
5900,2020-06-30 12:56:13,hijzxo,Democrats and Republicans are just two sides of the same coin. Neither side actually wants Bernie around.
5901,2020-06-30 15:32:55,hijzxo,"Bernie would never win. If DEMS has a chance to win we need the bigger New never Trump Republicans, the Dems already have the Republicans against Trump but to make up the lame Berniebros voting 3rd party we need the newer never Trumpers. Those people would vote Trump or 3rd party before a dirty Socialist. You know it and so does the DNC."

5903,2020-08-13 00:52:59,hijzxo,Here's a non automated message to remind you. Lol
5904,2020-07-01 06:54:29,hijzxo,Not one from anyone?
5905,2020-06-30 13:49:26,hijzxo,He also obviously doesn't have autocorrect on his phone.. just look at some of his tweets.
5906,2020-06-30 13:10:00,hijzxo,This is literally political propaganda. Government propaganda literally comes from the government.
5907,2020-06-30 13:28:40,hijzxo,I mean he did put 720 million women back into the United States work force.
5908,2020-06-30 14:48:41,hijzxo,He stands that way because of his ridiculous shoes
5909,2020-06-30 16:07:40,hijzxo,"Dude anyone who‚Äôs paying any attention right now sees the obvious signs. He can‚Äôt even formulate one single coherent sentence. It‚Äôs sad, I wanted Biden for president, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs fit anymore."
5910,2020-06-30 12:23:09,hijzxo,Lobbying needs to go. Then the media monopoly. Then you can have an actual election.

5914,2020-06-30 19:25:30,hijzxo,"The office of the POTUS is the only one with a requirement. It is age 35.

You can run for Congress,your state legislature, state, county or local offices at 18."
5915,2020-06-30 13:57:57,hijzxo,Right?
5916,2020-06-30 14:44:36,hijzxo,Biden makes Trump look razor-sharp.
5917,2020-06-30 15:11:41,hijzxo,Biden is a puppet to someone else. Hey can‚Äôt even remember all the lines that are being force fed to him
5918,2020-06-30 14:34:20,hijzxo,Trump was very beatable *last time*. But Hillary was allowed to choose herself as the nominee. I will never understand why it didn‚Äôt become a scandal that she was literally funding the DNC out of her own pocket.
5919,2020-06-30 15:30:30,hijzxo,I really like how any slightly negative Biden comments are getting downvoted. In a conspiracy sub. And a thread about how incompetent Biden is.
5920,2020-06-30 17:28:53,hijzxo,Exactly
5921,2020-07-01 00:49:21,hijzxo,Unfortunately Bernie isn‚Äôt part of the establishment :/
5922,2020-07-01 01:23:45,hijzxo,Agreed
5923,2020-06-30 13:30:56,hijzxo,Don't forget he put 720 million women back in the work force!
5924,2020-06-30 14:08:15,hijzxo,Agreed!
5925,2020-06-30 16:53:18,hijzxo,"we already know trump has issues too, it‚Äôs (for once) not about him or his issues. i think what you‚Äôre referring to is people just being tired of talking about trump bc we‚Äôve heard it repeatedly for 4 years so they‚Äôre talking about joe now. he‚Äôs the other one running. 

joe‚Äôs... pretty creepy, to say the least. idk, they both are, but joe smelling people‚Äôs hair just turns me off about as much as trump‚Äôs mouth so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

(prolly just gonna vote 3rd party, ngl. fuck trump and fuck biden)"
5926,2020-06-30 16:26:39,hijzxo,I can‚Äôt believe his wife is supporting this run. It really is a crying shame.
5927,2020-06-30 14:30:45,hijzxo,"He pooped his pants on TV.

This is the deal. If Joe were to drop out before the convention, the delegates would choose the nominee. 

If Joe drops out *after* the convention, the DNC gets to replace him.

That is why no VP pick, and why they are keeping him going."
5928,2020-06-30 14:49:09,hijzxo,Yep. They're throwing the election. Trump has been good for them.
5929,2020-06-30 13:58:31,hijzxo,"No one wants to read your Facebook posts, dad."

5931,2020-06-30 14:43:13,hijzxo,"I believe speaker of the house is the third in line, but I‚Äôm thinking that‚Äôs only used in the case of both the president and vp going out around the same time"
5932,2020-06-30 17:22:00,hijzxo,Lol let me know when you want to come back to reality
5933,2020-06-30 20:17:37,hijzxo,Biden‚Äôs also a rapist tho. He can‚Äôt form simple sentences and seems to be confused/being spoon fed things to say. Trump can at least be an effective public speaker still.
5934,2020-07-01 01:52:44,hijzxo,"Trump can formulate complete sentences. Biden can‚Äôt, I‚Äôve seen too many examples to ignore lately."
5935,2020-06-30 13:41:08,hijzxo,"I was about to say something, but I realised you‚Äôre a ghost fan so I‚Äôm gonna let it go"
5936,2020-06-30 15:37:19,hijzxo,"Man, these brain surgery comments are really getting downvoted. Must be more important than I thought. Guess I'll look into it."
5937,2020-06-30 15:39:06,hijzxo,Wow. At this point I'm just looking for the comments with the most downvotes. They seem to be the ones talking about things that are actually important.
5938,2020-06-30 15:09:47,hijzxo,Yeah trump is too scared and will wiggle his way out of it and somehow blame biden and youll believe him.
5939,2020-06-30 14:13:24,hijzxo,Sort of like how Putin has had control for the last 3 and a half years
5940,2020-06-30 16:58:08,hijzxo,literally though. our ‚Äúrepresentation‚Äù is not even remotely close to accurately representing the majority of the population. im really tired of out of touch old people making the important decisions in the US.
5941,2020-06-30 18:19:21,hijzxo,"1) as someone in their thirties, the thought of a twenty-something running the country is equally terrifying. 

2) the question shouldn‚Äôt be age, but mental health"
5942,2020-06-30 23:49:29,hijzxo,They all ready have an age minimum which is ageist.
5943,2020-06-30 22:28:39,hijzxo,Maybe because they couldn‚Äôt imagine someone living for 75+ years? I‚Äôm guessing the average life span in the late 1700‚Äôs was about 50 at the most.
5944,2020-07-01 01:39:54,hijzxo,lol  you want a 22 years old candidate. Sure.

5948,2020-06-30 23:18:01,hijzxo,I mean there is a third candidate that is also a Dr.
5949,2020-07-01 01:58:28,hijzxo,Kang and Kodos. I'd vote for them.
5950,2020-06-30 13:52:59,hijzxo,"Everyone said Yang shouldn't be president because he didn't know what he was doing.

Bruh, I just want a president that has more than half a functioning brain."
5951,2020-06-30 20:02:12,hijzxo,"Hillary didn‚Äôt have dementia, but she was a terrible candidate."
5952,2020-06-30 16:33:11,hijzxo,"Are you serious? I can't tell. Hillary Clinton is CLEARLY not in any sort of mental decline. She's articulate and speaks public ally pretty well. She has control, she's careful with what words she uses. She's clearly no where near as far gone as Trump or Biden in terms of decline from age."

Called himself the most conservative democrat in the Senate in the 90s.

5956,2020-06-30 15:01:23,hijzxo,That‚Äôs what the DNC was banking on.

5958,2020-06-30 20:02:44,hijzxo,Ehhh debatable.

Biden was LOSING, he was FARRRR behind Bernie. South Carolina changed that in one day. That‚Äôs absolutely insane that one state essentially determined this election.

5961,2020-06-30 14:05:13,hijzxo,Vermin supreme?
5962,2020-06-30 14:45:43,hijzxo,It‚Äôs completely a possibility.
5963,2020-06-30 15:28:07,hijzxo,It will be Harris as VP which is too bad since she would be the best AG to lock all those Trump criminals up.
5964,2020-06-30 18:33:40,hijzxo,Care to explain why?
5965,2020-06-30 15:09:05,hijzxo,These guys and ties to these guys plus others that are Ashkenazi extremist talmud following peeps who try to bring forward the noahide laws that promote killing goyim
5966,2020-06-30 22:48:31,hijzxo,thats because democrats are mentally unstable
5967,2020-06-30 14:46:09,hijzxo,No. He won‚Äôt release his college transcripts nor tax returns. Oh and all his misspelled tweets. Is that also on purpose?  Part of his undercover op to break up international human trafficking??
5968,2020-06-30 15:12:56,hijzxo,He speaks and talks at a fucking 1st grade level and he lies to your fucking face and doubles down on the lies.
5969,2020-06-30 22:49:12,hijzxo,its true the masses are generally not very intelligent edit: that being said trump is still the logical choice.
5970,2020-06-30 17:53:40,hijzxo,Not to be dramatic or non BUT I rather have a piece of wood at the office tbh
5971,2020-06-30 13:00:51,hijzxo,Except Republicans didn‚Äôt mobilize twice to stop Trump
5972,2020-06-30 17:22:39,hijzxo,"Sorry but thats a crock of shit, obama didn't win by appealing to moderate republicans he won by appealing to the progressive left, he was full of shit but thats how he won, you will lose more votes from the left than you will gain from the right by appealing to the right, thats why establishment neolibs keep loosing, not because they haven't gone far enough right but because they've gone too far right."
5973,2020-07-12 01:31:03,hijzxo,!remindme 5 months
5974,2020-06-30 13:36:03,hijzxo,"Yeah and this comes straight from the government, right out of the whitehouse and it's re-election campaign."

5976,2020-06-30 17:09:46,hijzxo,"Go watch the myriad of democratic debates and then come back and tell us how Biden ""can't formulate one single coherent sentence.""

He's not the greatest debater in the world, but anyone saying he can't put a sentence together is just parroting right-wing propaganda. 

It's also a completely ineffective attack given his opponent truly cannot communicate a coherent thought and Trump is already shedding senior support without more being turned-off to these attacks on another senior's mental acuity"
5977,2020-06-30 16:17:06,hijzxo,"And you dont think Trump is expressing those exact same symptoms?

Couldnt walk down a ramp, cant hold a water bottle to his mouth with one hand, cant formulate any logical sentence that isnt on a teleprompter in big fucking letters..."

5982,2020-06-30 16:38:32,hijzxo,Puppet to who?

5984,2020-07-01 01:18:46,hijzxo,Then I guess I support Kamala to satiate the rioters :‚Äô[
5985,2020-07-01 01:34:49,hijzxo,The old bait and switch.
5986,2020-06-30 14:28:24,hijzxo,Also 120 million people have died of the coronavirus.
5987,2020-06-30 14:11:55,hijzxo,"He also broke up millions of Black and other minority families. Threw millions in jail for possessing the same amount of crack as others possessed in cocaine, simply because coke was considered a ‚Äúwhite‚Äù drug while crack was primarily used by Blacks in those days. Implemented the three-strikes rule, which overcrowded prisons and cost us greatly in taxpayer‚Äôs money. Opposed busing, pushed for re-segregation in schools... promised to raise taxes and implement mandatory masks in public nationwide if elected..."
5988,2020-06-30 14:59:29,hijzxo,"Waiiiit... what?! Please tell me the poop comment was a joke. I‚Äôm getting even more worried now.

Thanks for explaining this to me. Things are looking far more strategic (irt Joe‚Äôs selection as candidate) than ever before!"
5989,2020-06-30 15:00:51,hijzxo,Forgot to ask: would Obama be able to run in his stead?

5991,2020-06-30 14:50:44,hijzxo,"What if the plan is to get Biden elected, then deem him unfit which would make the VP the POTUS and then move Pelosi in as the VP? Holy Shit!"
5992,2020-06-30 22:44:04,hijzxo,"Biden isn‚Äôt a confirmed rapist, but he probably has done some less than legal stuff in that department ... and trump is sluring his words in every speech, and can‚Äôt even put together a decent sentence. Biden is still the lesser of two evils, and if we‚Äôre lucky his running mate will be better."
5993,2020-06-30 16:45:18,hijzxo,yeah hes a fuckin poser
5994,2020-06-30 13:45:18,hijzxo,Papa for president
5995,2020-06-30 15:41:14,hijzxo,Crazy. Didn‚Äôt even notice it. Glad everyone here loves rational thinking lol
5996,2020-06-30 15:27:35,hijzxo,"Um, not at all. Lmfao."
5997,2020-06-30 23:30:46,hijzxo,I‚Äôm tired of racist rich old people making the decisions. It‚Äôs not like they aren‚Äôt fucking over tons of vulnerable old people in the process
5998,2020-06-30 20:02:07,hijzxo,"‚ÄúOld people‚Äù only seem out of touch because you‚Äôre young and still don‚Äôt know your ass from a hole in the ground. 

Yeah, let‚Äôs put a bunch of people whose brains aren‚Äôt even fully developed yet in charge of shit. Only young people (people under 30-35) whose brains aren‚Äôt fully developed yet think that‚Äôs a good idea."
5999,2020-06-30 19:04:04,hijzxo,"I agree it shouldn't be on age but I don't think I would trust anyone to accurately, and without bias, assess a candidate's mental health unfortunately"
6000,2020-06-30 20:15:53,hijzxo,"Most people don't trust old people to drive. I know my grandparents can't drive and I believe my grandma is about 5-6 years younger than Trump. Let alone Biden. I think an age limit on leaders of our country is a good idea. But definitely keep the minimum age requirement. I'm about to turn thirty and definitely can't lead my own household, let alone a country."
6001,2020-07-01 08:27:20,hijzxo,Gotta be 35 or older to run for president
6002,2020-07-01 00:10:19,hijzxo,It should be a little bit of both...
6003,2020-07-02 07:09:28,hijzxo,"Lol . Well, obviously. I don‚Äôt think any of us would willingly vote for a 20 year old. I think it‚Äôs implied that someone too old or too young is just unsuitable most of the time. It would be nice to have candidates within the age rages of 35-55."
6004,2020-07-01 01:25:13,hijzxo,"Honestly, what I think we might need is a panel of 3 at this point. Ages 20-35, 35- 50 and 50- 65, retire at 65. One member from each age group, must be 8 years off from other members. 2 person majority for all votes. I know it would be unrealistic, but probably the most efficient way to represent the people."
6005,2020-06-30 19:57:36,hijzxo,"Well, the minimum age limit of 32 (I think, but it‚Äôs at least 30) is still valid, but the upper limit should be between 50-60 at the time of going into office.

What parameters would you suggest for mental health?"
6006,2020-07-15 14:53:34,hijzxo,Better than a 70 or 80 year old.
6007,2020-06-30 16:20:26,hijzxo,I think of this episode EVERY election! It's never not been the case lol!
6008,2020-07-01 01:47:01,hijzxo,That episode is how we explained voting to our kids.
6009,2020-06-30 16:01:56,hijzxo,Yet y'all figured out how to do it anyway with ol' Boris
6010,2020-06-30 15:18:05,hijzxo,Which is why I was referring to presidential candidates and not candidates for prime minister..
6011,2020-07-01 00:09:37,hijzxo,If the candidate isn't affiliated with the two-party paradigm then he or she has no chance in the primaries.
6012,2020-06-30 14:22:46,hijzxo,Yang got censored by the media because he actually had great ideas... Same with Gabbard

6016,2020-06-30 16:37:56,hijzxo,When she's not passing out and getting thrown in the back of a van. Bernie's heart attack in October also gets amazingly memory-holed
6017,2020-06-30 15:54:35,hijzxo,"In his whole career. I can think of worse shit on Trump in just the last 4 years. 

Biden is shit, Bernie was the real change, as its our ruling class and their billions that fuck us over. No change other than taking back our money will help against them. But its too late now. Maybe someday soon people will wake up."

6022,2020-06-30 14:06:55,hijzxo,Jo Jorgensen. She got the bid and I'm impressed.
6023,2020-06-30 17:40:32,hijzxo,She said she wouldn‚Äôt consider it. This is a pipe dream of people who miss Barack.
6024,2020-06-30 16:23:44,hijzxo,"So is flipping a coin and it landing straight up and down. Possible, but won't happen. Michelle Obama is not capable of running a country. She couldn't run school lunch programs."
6025,2020-06-30 15:26:58,hijzxo,Except Michelle said no. I think it should be Obama. Trump would kill him self he hates Obama more than his kids and Americans.
6026,2020-07-01 02:37:20,hijzxo,"Because according to top aides and Bolton he‚Äôs the one who controls Trump. We all knew it was someone, at least it‚Äôs him and not Fredo (DTJR) Bannon or Miller."

They don't care, they are beholden to the same mega corporate donors as republicans, the dnc is nothing more than controlled opposition."
6034,2020-06-30 14:27:04,hijzxo,"Everyone acts like the republicans actually wanted Trump to be the nominee.
They were *horrified*. But they learned to work with what they were given. The DNC literally *does not trust people, even it‚Äôs own primary voters, with the vote* THAT should scare everyone."
6035,2020-06-30 18:27:10,hijzxo,Why would republicans do that to there own party?
6036,2020-06-30 14:46:25,hijzxo,Hahahahaha. This comment is spot on.
6037,2020-06-30 13:44:31,hijzxo," ""**The lady doth protest too much, methinks**"""
6038,2020-06-30 17:27:53,hijzxo,"Lol you‚Äôre entitled to your opinion even if it‚Äôs wrong.  No upstanding Republicans who has joined the never Trumpers would ever vote for a socialist. That‚Äôs the line they have drawn. You know I‚Äôm right. I‚Äôm a Sanders supporter as in he doesn‚Äôt irked me, to say he would won against Trump makes you delusional. That‚Äôs a fact. Socialism has been a dirtied up word by the racial right for years now. 

And I see how you proceeded to skirt around my comment and throw a Obama false fact. That may work with the lame Berniebros or MAGA cult but it failed horribly short with me.

Be best"
6039,2020-06-30 17:26:52,hijzxo,Boy you ever wonder why the dnc keeps putting up candidates that seem to play right into the republicans hands? because they have the same fucking corporate donor base and losing is still a winning strategy.
6040,2020-06-30 13:43:38,hijzxo,"Gotcha. I misunderstood your ""this""."
6041,2020-06-30 17:10:23,hijzxo,"I‚Äôm telling you it‚Äôs only gotten severe as of late, like post covid. Just use your eyes please."
6042,2020-06-30 16:17:49,hijzxo,"I think Biden actually has dementia and can‚Äôt formulate simple sentences. Trump might be showing general signs of getting old, but he‚Äôs still an effective public speaker"
6043,2020-07-01 13:22:36,hijzxo,"I don‚Äôt think either of their egos would let that happen, in fact, I think it‚Äôs the opposite. I think Trump fully expected to lose, but make a good showing. Hillary expected to win. That‚Äôs why she couldn‚Äôt make a concession speech- she was completely unprepared for the possibility. And Trump? All I can say is, he doesn‚Äôt even like to leave Trump tower to go out to dinner. He had everything he needed, and no one told him he was playing golf too much or he couldn‚Äôt hide his daughter. I think he hates being President- but his ego won‚Äôt let him *lose*. I am hoping he finds a face-saving way to exit before the elections. I‚Äôd love to see Nikki Haley in there."
6044,2020-07-01 01:20:27,hijzxo,"In the current political climate I would more expect her to engage in cringe identity politics moves like black lives matter signs in the White House and establishing race quotas. She‚Äôs an opportunist and she knows that her skin color is a major advantage in America right now, and she will exploit that despite it going against her actual political views."
6045,2020-06-30 15:11:21,hijzxo,Yes he misspoke and immediately corrected himself. When has trump corrected anything hes said that was demonstrably incorrect? He doubles down and lies to your face about everything. Whats the count now? 11k lies in office? Fuck off.
6046,2020-06-30 14:43:20,hijzxo,And men and women are created equally by you know the thing. And if you vote for trump you arnt black.
6047,2020-06-30 14:16:40,hijzxo,Yet trump is racist youll never see a bigger double standard then anything democrats talk about.
6048,2020-06-30 20:27:13,hijzxo,"I think Romney was an honest attempt. McCain felt like a token, especially when he picked Palin."

6054,2020-06-30 20:33:06,hijzxo,Age minimum is 35 for president.

6057,2020-06-30 16:46:39,hijzxo,"Have you ever considered that, maybe, most, if not all, of the stuff involving Hillary Clinton's dark past and medical issues were completely manufactured by her opponent and their cabal of associates? Maybe the real conspiracy here is that Trump, aided by Russia, cheated in the 2016 election with coordinated disinformation, registration and vote tampering? 

I mean, look at the people involved here. Who's more likely to be doing shady shit? Trump has demonstrated himself in the past four years to be a complete shit head with zero empathy. He hates america. Putin is a fucking war criminal. I wouldn't be surprised if they are the ones responsible for that messaging."
6058,2020-06-30 16:22:02,hijzxo,Bernie was real change alright. We would have been changed to Venezula. Awesome üëå
6059,2020-07-02 04:37:46,hijzxo,no really nothing trump has done can outdo biden especially on the last statement where literally millions of black men were overly incarcerated. trump has actually been kind of great for the country
6060,2020-06-30 16:23:46,hijzxo,"Biden is evil, Trump is more evil. Can't vote for either of them."
6061,2020-06-30 17:04:34,hijzxo,Donald Trump was a business man and look where he is now. Actually being qualified to run a country has absolutely nothing to do with it
6062,2020-06-30 16:24:54,hijzxo,Who said anything about her being able to run a country? Biden has dementia and he‚Äôs running. Lmfao. She‚Äôd be there to secure the black vote.
6063,2020-06-30 18:58:03,hijzxo,"Michelle Obama is a Princeton graduate. Also a Harvard Law graduate. Please, guy in your mother‚Äôs basement, tell us more about what she is and is not capable of."
6064,2020-06-30 15:30:47,hijzxo,That‚Äôs a dumb reason to want Obama but ok
6065,2020-06-30 15:10:15,hijzxo,Obama did the same thing with his speeches. He is amazing speaker and could probably speak for 3 hours without missing a beat or hesitation. BUT we would always insert pauses and ‚Äòum‚Äô into his speeches to seem more personable and relatable to Americans. The presidency is a popularity contest to make the American people think they play a part in our government when in reality the president (all of them previous) doesn‚Äôt do anything for the country. It‚Äôs just a face for the people
6066,2020-06-30 15:14:28,hijzxo,"YOU dont. WE fucking care a lot. Trump has been an unmitigated fucking disaster

And its clear that you dont care. Youre too stupid to care."
6067,2020-06-30 15:34:16,hijzxo,They thought trump would be their puppet instead of Putin‚Äôs.
6068,2020-06-30 17:41:34,hijzxo,"Its funny how noelibs will at the same time blame bernie voters for not voting for their candidate yet don't think bernie could win. You can't have it both ways. 95% of republicans think trump is doing a great job bet a percentage of those that don't will still vote for him anyway, there are not enough stragglers left. There are far more leftist voters that vote third party or don't vote cause there is no candidate that they would vote for than there are stray republicans that don't approve of trump."
6069,2020-06-30 17:24:25,hijzxo,"No it has not. Are you actually using your eyes or just taking in clips cut for propaganda? You need to go watch a full-length town hall or something before your start making these kind of claims.

For instance, the recent clip of Biden's gaffe referencing ""120 million"" Covid deaths has him cut off before he quickly corrected himself

Keep setting low expectations though!"
6070,2020-06-30 16:21:12,hijzxo,Do you honestly think that they would push someone with dementia up as a candidate just because?
6071,2020-07-01 11:59:57,hijzxo,"That‚Äôs fine and good if it leads to the DNC taking control in November, but it‚Äôs going to alienate younger voters, independents, and confused yung republicans. Not to mention the California thing is going to enrage us conspiracy theorists. If I vote for her, I need her to smoke way more cigarettes and practice more mindfulness."
6072,2020-06-30 14:47:47,hijzxo,"And he pooped his pants on TV

ok, this is the first clip I found, you can look for others.

6076,2020-06-30 20:33:26,hijzxo,"Like I said, at least 30, but thanks for clarifying."
6077,2020-06-30 17:33:40,hijzxo,"That would be a very valid point, except I have been watching the Hilary/Clinton shit show for 30 years now. Well before Trump."
6078,2020-06-30 17:15:02,hijzxo,That is a very wide two way street
6079,2020-06-30 18:24:09,hijzxo,"i think it's telling you're getting downvotes in a conspiracy sub for pointing out a proven conspiracy but if i had to guess it's because Hillary is actually a terrible human who should never have run and i think there's no way trump would have won if literally anyone else ran against him. much of the country already distrusted Hillary after Obama's presidency and the handling of Libya, Benghazi, etc. 

I think it was a terrible decision to run her, i think her campaign was horribly managed and i know for a fact russians made massive contributions to her already failed run. i also firmly believe any single republican could have easily defeated her and that 2016 was probably one of the strangest elections we'll see in a long time (although this election cycle is also strange but for different reasons arguably out of either candidates control, although also arguably partly in trumps control with regards to some of the ways the pandemic has effected us here."
6080,2020-06-30 16:28:32,hijzxo,"How is healthcare and higher taxes socialism, retard ? We already had higher taxation in the 50's. Were we ""Venezuela"" then ? 

As long as you don't understand that a small amount of people getting all the money is the source of most of our problems, and that redistribution isn't ""becoming Venezuela"" you will remain a useful idiot for the billionaire class."
6081,2020-07-02 05:03:41,hijzxo,"Lol. At over 100,000 covid deaths, something he was constantly criticized for, yet did nothing. All of Europe did better. China did better with over 5 times our population. But sure, keep thinking Trump was great for the country LMAO"
6082,2020-06-30 16:26:08,hijzxo,"Yeah, both are awful. I can understand not voting this time."
6083,2020-06-30 17:17:58,hijzxo,2020 in a nutshell
6084,2020-06-30 17:08:35,hijzxo,This country is in a way a business. Mr. Trump is more than qualified and it has everything to do with it. I would be willing to bet that you think Joe Biden is qualified because he has been in office for almost 50 years. What has he accomplished besides champion legislation that sets back the black community. I will wait.
6085,2020-06-30 16:25:43,hijzxo,So you think blacks vote only based on color? Interesting
6086,2020-06-30 19:09:26,hijzxo,"Graduatung college does not qualify you to be anything except what you studied. She will not run for VP because she makes so much money forcing you to watch liberal Netflix shows. Also, pointing out a misspelling is something children do. You clearly know what I meant. Just like everyone else here, you have little argument but plenty of personal attacks. That is not winning an argument."
6087,2020-06-30 15:57:41,hijzxo,"Its the whole Biden campaign though. ""Not Trump"". Which might work, as lots of people really hate him, but as long as the person in charge bows to corporations, we are still fucked."
6088,2020-06-30 15:14:46,hijzxo,For you. Not for us.
6089,2020-06-30 15:43:09,hijzxo,"It‚Äôs really pointless to engage in a conversation with people who say things like ‚ÄúPutins puppet‚Äù, without ever explaining in what way Trump is acting in Russia‚Äôs interests. There was a 3 year investigation, and it was a hug nothing burger."
6090,2020-06-30 17:43:09,hijzxo,95% hahaha that‚Äôs a stretch? Well I have t read  the daily MAGA cult emails so yeah. Highly unlikely.
6091,2020-06-30 15:27:03,hijzxo,"Wait, he did? Wow, I missed that one."
6092,2020-06-30 14:48:45,hijzxo,And his obsession with children and smelling and groping them.
6093,2020-06-30 15:13:55,hijzxo,What?
6094,2020-06-30 21:04:37,hijzxo,I really do think they were throwing it. Obama energized the Right Wing quite a bit. Look how rabid they got after eight years.

also, does he really have a point? he is claiming that the reason we need to keep electing old people is because the human brain isn‚Äôt developed when younger than 35. that just isnt true. generally the brain is fully developed by mid twenties, not 35. and even if their brains aren‚Äôt fully developed, they are still a closer representation, which is what they are elected to be, than any of the people currently elected. we have been doing it this way for a long time and look how its going. while yes, the USA is an amazing place to live, I think it is time for some changes in our government to reflect the modern world we live in. 

these people dont even understand how twitter works. remember when Ted Cruz liked a porn tweet on his official twitter account? they are completely out of touch and not fit to serve in modern times. those are just my 2 cents and I imagine some will disagree and at the end of the day we all know the government isnt going to change no matter what you do so it really doesnt matter"

Yes, I am old enough to remember him in his younger years, being married to Ivana, and his children were little *when he filed for bankruptcy the first time.*

I actually do very well for myself and I didn't inherit millions from my parents. Why is the money and the fact that he is a 'billionarie' so important to you? And why try to compare his wealth to mine as if my opinion on it is not valid because i am not a billionaire..? 

Being a medicocre business man does not qualify him to know how to run a country and dictate foreign policy and diplomacy.

Your long list of cabinet members being fired is no indicator of success or failure. Record low unemployment(pre covid), tax cuts (I personally benefited as a regular worker), no more ACA penalty, prison reform bill, GI benefits no longer expire, restored funding to the military (most important troop pay), stopped H1B visas during covid unemployment of Americans.

For one thing, he is not a blatant grifter and a thief. Oh, I plan on voting. You can be sure of that. :)

Lol, Why do I have to follow your ridiculous parameters to respond? You want to stack the debate in your favor because you know trump is a white supremacist sympathizer. Need I remind you of the full page ad he took out about the central park 5, and then was found to be wrong? The birther BS he spent years crying about? The white power tweet he sent out the other day to virture signal his racist fan base?  They are worse than stop and frisk which many politicians admit now was a mistake. Can trump ever admit a mistake? 


>It matters because you are judging a man for something you clearly couldn't and didn't do. Give your hate a rest already. It's been 4 years and you have 4 more to go. 

I am judging him on *how* he makes his money,  which isn't clean or honest. You should care about that, too. Yes, he's barely a billionaire but the way he got it is worse, by being a crook.

You mentioned unemployment rates earlier. The unemployment rate when he was sworn in was 4.7%. Yes, that is still way below the national average but he had nothingto do with that already low number. After 4 years in office of March of this year (before covid) it was at 4.4%. Hardly mind-blowing results since he inherited a stable economy when he came in. 

It's weird that people that are obsessed with trump can never find anything wrong with what he does. That is the most concerning thing to me. Its like you've been brainwashed."

You also disregard that Biden lied about inquiring the investigation into Michael Flynn. There was no crime or basis to begin an investigation they did it anyway. He lied about it because admitting otherwise would be implementing Obama as well. 

You call Trump racist yet Joe Biden had his part in the 1994 crime bill which gave harsher sentences during the crack epedemic which affected a majority of black people. The anti-bussing bill designed to keep schools segregated.

If you want to support Biden, you are spinning your wheels talking about what Trump has done or hasn't done. Lesser of two evils. Your guy is a corrupt, racist, liar amd a 49 year loser at his job. He has been there to do nothing but fail presidential bids, which will be his 3rd failure now. He has done nothing but enrich himslef. Something you claim Trump does. Your brain appears to be washed my friend!"
6190,2020-07-01 20:21:47,hijzxo,"Btw you fail to answer why you want to vote for Joe. Name some policy you agree with, name his accomplishments you are proud of, name what he will change for the better. You cannot because your hatred for Trump is ALL you care about. So much so you will be voting for fucking Biden."
6191,2020-06-30 17:33:36,hijzxo,"That is EXACTLY what I thought. This discussion always ends the same. No examples, no supporting evidence, and most importantly you cannot point to any individual who fled socialism who would advocate for it. Have a nice day."
6192,2020-07-01 20:43:04,hijzxo,"I'm not disregarding any of that. That is the first time you brought up ukraine. I addressed the stop and frisk already, he admitted it was a mistake. Many politicians on that bill admitted that. Please don't put words in my mouth when that conversation between us didn't even happen.

You really and truly don't think trump did anything wrong with Ukraine? What about polarizing our nation? What about the delayed action to covid 19? Nothing? Truly?

They investigated Biden and his son, he came out clean. -- and that is with a republican senate majority. Not sure what you want me to say about that. It went through our justice system and he came out innocent even with the deck stacked against him.

They investigated trump too, and found there was enough evidence for an impeachment trial but the GoP and key players like bolton didn't testify. They put party first (except Mitt) and bolton wanted to cash in on his book. Bolton even said he should have testified and that what was found was just the tip of the iceberg and they should have dug deeper. Why would he say that?

Yes, trump is a racist, a bigger one than Biden, yes. You trying to paint a different picture of trump being less of one is...laughable. If I were you, I wouldn't even go there. It's embarrassing.

Lesser of 2 evils? Without a doubt that would be Biden. He could be dead and puppeteered by his cabinet like weekend at bernies, and would still be better than trump. Trump is being puppeteered by Russia and China, all while polarizing our nation, politicizing wearing a mask for people's saftey, and  because all the cabinet members that knew what they were doing, left. I believe they said he is ""incompetent"" and a ""complete moron"" --  Direct quotes from General Mattis and Rex Tillerson."
6193,2020-07-01 20:43:41,hijzxo,You haven't answered any of my questions either. You first.
6194,2020-06-30 17:38:30,hijzxo,"Isnt it cool ? You don't even need to read my comments, or know what socialism means. All you need is one question. ""When has it worked bro"". And you won ! 

No research, not thinking that such a big topic as a political ideology should have more to it, no questioning why so many people agree with it. Or how much it changes from the different takes you can get. 

Nah. One question is enough for you to be right. Congratulations."
6195,2020-07-01 20:48:57,hijzxo,"Dude you are a brick wall. Source an actual quote proving Trump is a racist... I will go first...

https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/12/07/joe-biden-refuses-to-explain-what-he-meant-by-roaches-in-2017-video/

You arent changing my mind on anything. I am confused why even try. I am voting for a guy who is the only thing standing in the liberal's way from tearing this country down with the help of BLM and Antifa. A 9/11 event couldn't bring this country back together. I am a patriot and veteran of this great country and I look forward to when this all comes to a head. Part 2 is already underway."
6196,2020-07-01 20:54:07,hijzxo,"What is laughable is you, just like every other democrat, cannot cite something of Biden you are for or proud of. It is the easiest way to get the best of you guys. Hahah"
6197,2020-06-30 17:41:31,hijzxo,"All the people who agree with it have never had to live under it. You have no examples except a ""definition"" of what you think an idea is. An idea that has NEVER worked. Ask a Cuban who fled how they feel. They would call you simple for even suggesting socialism. You have never learned simple history and the outcomes of these attempts. It is quite sad

Thank you for the win. Enjoy your day, if you can..."
6198,2020-07-01 21:34:26,hijzxo,"You're sourcing Breitbart. That's not even a credible source, are you even aware of that? They are known to publish false conspiracy theories and misleading and manipulated quotes. Talk about a brick wall.

6199,2020-07-01 21:19:27,hijzxo,"Well, he was already vice president for 8 years and was part of an administration that picked up our economy when it was in the shitter from 8 years of republican management.  Also, no one quit that cabinet out of shear frustration of having to work with a moron, so he has that going for him, too. 

Based on that alone, he is already more qualified. I'm sorry if he doesn't have countless lawsuits against him for stealing peoples money or paying hush money to porn stars, haha."
6200,2020-07-01 21:37:31,hijzxo,"What is credible to your liberal mind? CNN, wiki, Snopes? Haha you are officially a clown. Kung flu is racist? Talk about grasping for straws. The thing came from China... kinda like... KUNG FU! Hahaha. Piss off already. You cant win here

Also, you know what I mean you commie fuck. See you on the battlefield"
6201,2020-07-01 21:21:39,hijzxo,"That was so pathetic. So he was on a ""winning team"" and thats what he accomplished. You still couldn't leave Trump out of your explination. It is extremely satisfying reading your post. Enjoy screaming at the sky for 4 more years, pal.

BTW... nobody votes for the VP. La who sa her!"
6202,2020-07-01 21:44:36,hijzxo,"Yes, It's a racist thing to say, especially coming from our president. Incredibly unprofessional. The fact that you don't realize that speaks volumes.

I didnt realize this was a competition. You will never agree with me and I will never agree with you. However, you might want to try to debate without name calling, because you lose credibility when you resort to that.

It's clear we come from very different backgrounds and we both think the other is brain washed. We will have to wait and see who comes down on the right side of history."
6203,2020-07-01 21:49:50,hijzxo,"I have lost zero credibility by saying you are a clown for discrediting Breitbart. It is clear you have never been there. Anyone voting D is a commie FUCK. You want equality? Start by giving all YOU have to those  who dont and let me decide what I do with what I EARN.My background is pure love of country and freedom. I will always be on the right side of history. Good day, sir"
6204,2020-06-30 19:28:32,hiju07,"1: He'll never drop out.    
2: You don't want him to drop out.    

He needs to be defeated at the polls.  If he drops out or Impeachment had taken him out of office, he will spend the rest of his life making money off of books, TV, maybe even his own news network (they were going to do that before he won in 2016) claiming that the ""Deep State"" kicked him out of office before he could do the ""REAL"" work that his base wanted him to do.  The ONLY way you get close to having the American People have their say is to vote him out.  Besides, if he doesn't make it to the election, you end up having Pence run.  Pence is just as if not crazier than Trump without the Twitter account.  The Republicans that will abandon Trump will be able to vote for Pence, and THAT can be dangerous for everyone who isn't a White Male in the US.    

Let him be fragile.  Let him be mad and sad.  Let him get beat up for the next 4 months.  Let him be off his game and get destroyed at some debates.  Let Pence be uncomfortable having to debate against a woman.  Take the next 4 months to register as many people as possible to vote, and encourage them to get out AND vote.  Mail In ballot or In Person, just vote.  It is the ONLY way that the American people can send a clear message to Trump and his ilk that he isn't wanted."
6205,2020-06-30 17:56:44,hiju07,Quitter
6206,2020-06-30 15:16:34,hiju07,I want this to be true so badly
6207,2020-06-30 19:37:20,hiju07,Fat orange baby threatens to take his ball and go home if he doesn‚Äôt get his way.
6208,2020-06-30 15:09:13,hijtuf,I do not see this happening. Trump is not the kind of person to give up and admit defeat. He will go down kicking and screaming like the child he is.
6209,2020-06-30 15:23:31,hijtuf,Not happening but goddamn what a twist that would be
6210,2020-06-30 15:56:59,hijtuf,"Fuck no.

Trump will not willfully concede. He is running to the very end when he (hopefully) loses and only has his ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rigged, but oh well‚Äù bullshit to cling too."
6211,2020-06-30 15:21:50,hijtuf,News like this is good for Trump because it will make people see him winning as less likely and therefore not go and vote assuming his loss is a foregone conclusion. A huge factor in him winning first time round!
6212,2020-06-30 14:23:55,hijtuf,"Please God, please"
6213,2020-06-30 16:14:11,hijtuf,No. Wait. Come back.
6214,2020-06-30 16:12:17,hijtuf,"He's correct. People really do want law, order, and safety. Which have all suffered greatly under his leadership in reverse."
6215,2020-06-30 17:15:43,hijtuf,This doesn‚Äôt seem true at all. I highly doubt trump is going to drop out. I like how the source is the ever elusive ‚Äúinsiders‚Äù. What exactly is an ‚Äúinsider‚Äù? Like a security guard for the White House parking lot? A cabinet secretary? A former campaign manager? These sources are BS
6216,2020-06-30 15:18:00,hijtuf,I highly doubt this happens
6217,2020-06-30 18:30:04,hijtuf,This will not happen. This is a calculated move to fire up his base and make his opposition complacent. Don‚Äôt let it work.
6218,2020-07-01 00:43:11,hijtuf,"Even if true, let's not act like Trump is the sole problem. We've learned that the entire system is rotten to the core and that's not going away with just one election."
6219,2020-06-30 17:48:59,hijtuf,"Fucking GOOOOOOOOOD!! Hoping, praying,wishing this orange sack of shit drops out."
6220,2020-06-30 23:17:36,hijtuf,Don't threaten me with a good time!
6221,2020-06-30 20:44:06,hijtuf,"Don‚Äôt tell me about the pain, show me a baby."
6222,2020-07-01 02:13:53,hijtuf,Please 2020 do us a solid here
6223,2020-06-30 15:16:21,hijtuf,"GO, YOU BIG ORANGE CRYBABY"
6224,2020-06-30 18:27:04,hijtuf,Snowflake behaviour from people who love to call others snowflakes? Who'd have thought?
6225,2020-06-30 15:01:48,hijtuf,Maybe this isn't the darkest timeline.
6226,2020-06-30 15:20:45,hijtuf,"Yeah, his ego won‚Äôt let him drop out. I could see him leaving DC in November if he loses, though. He won‚Äôt help with the transition, just fuck off back to Mar-a-Lago and sulk until January."
6227,2020-06-30 15:43:54,hijtuf,"Depends on whether it'll look better for him to drop out and claim that the ""Dems rigged the election so bad, he doesn't want to give them the satisfaction"", or take the loss and claim ""the Dems stole the election"".   

It all really depends on if the Republicans think he can retain power for them.  One thing I saw floating around is convincing Donny to drop out, throwing up Romney as the candidate to compete against Biden, and then using Romney to pardon all their bullshit for the last 4 years. 

If Trump loses, and the senate swings blue, the next four years will see Democrats patching up the legal system to prevent Republicans and any other shit bag party like them from hijacking the system ever again."
6228,2020-06-30 16:35:23,hijtuf,"I wouldn't at all be surprised to see him flee the country (coincidentally to somewhere with no extradition treaty) spending the next few years screaming about a ""deep state coup"" and pretending to be the rightful President in exile."
6229,2020-06-30 22:25:15,hijtuf,He will go down making up tissue paper thin excuses like the child he is.
6230,2020-06-30 22:59:51,hijtuf,I think he can make a good excuse to not run. Excuses is what he's good at.
6231,2020-07-01 06:38:19,hijtuf,This is something where he risks defeat because he doesn't own the situation as much and I don't think his pride could risk losing the election.
6232,2020-07-06 10:33:22,hijtuf,"I dunno, someone with his sort of ego may prefer to drop out and make some BS claim like ""I achieved everything I needed to in 1 term"" rather than lose."
6233,2020-06-30 15:25:03,hijtuf,[deleted]
6234,2020-06-30 21:56:46,hijtuf,"And if he's still alive in 2024, he'll be in the Republican primaries, trying to get reelected. Presidential terms don't have to be consecutive."
6235,2020-06-30 20:42:29,hijtuf,"I think enough democrats have PTSD from 2016 to not get complacent this time around. Some might, but not on the scale of the last election.

Doesn't matter what the news says,VOTE"
6236,2020-06-30 19:24:48,hijtuf,Help. Police. Murder.
6237,2020-06-30 17:39:11,hijtuf,Willy Wonka reference?
6238,2020-06-30 18:06:56,hijtuf,Why? Can‚Äôt win honestly? Have to bully your way around the world and Nazi free speech? Fucking Nazi. Trump 2020.
6239,2020-06-30 17:20:39,hijtuf,"I fully expect him to start acting nuts if he loses.

Full on lunatic"
6240,2020-06-30 21:53:49,hijtuf,"Nah. He'll still be there in January, having done exactly zero transition, still insisting that the election was rigged by fake mail-in ballots. He won't leave the White House until he's *physically* forced to do so.

(This physical removal will later be used as 'proof' of the 'coup' to his most loyal fans.)"
6241,2020-06-30 16:26:05,hijtuf,"Let's hold the Democrats feet to the fire when they win.  Fix this shit ricky-tick, fuckers."
6242,2020-07-01 01:04:09,hijtuf,I've been saying for the past couple years I don't think he'll die on American soil. He'll probably live out his days in Moscow.
6243,2020-07-01 00:28:36,hijtuf,The tiniest amount just like his child sized hands.
6244,2020-07-01 02:54:25,hijtuf,His shit-heel kids are also going to run.
6245,2020-06-30 18:54:39,hijtuf,Yessir you got it!
6246,2020-06-30 18:11:19,hijtuf,Did you use Nazi as a verb?
6247,2020-06-30 21:57:46,hijtuf,"> Fucking Nazi. Trump 2020.

Is that his new campaign slogan?"
6248,2020-06-30 19:08:18,hijtuf,Are you talking about Trump?  Cause it sure sounds like it.
6249,2020-06-30 17:36:38,hijtuf,"Nah, he'll just blame mail-in voting and tie up the election results in court for months."
6250,2020-07-01 02:17:16,hijtuf,I'm expecting martial law due to COVID if he loses.
6251,2020-06-30 21:39:23,hijtuf,How will we know the difference?
6252,2020-07-04 04:46:25,hijtuf,Im so fucking excited for either outcome from the sheer meme energy that'll be released
6253,2020-07-06 10:34:09,hijtuf,"When his time is up, I honestly believe he'll have to be physically removed from the White House."
6254,2020-07-01 01:02:23,hijtuf,Completely agree. No way he ever concedes at any point. Inauguration Day could potentially be a dangerous day if he loses and stirs up his cult enough.
6255,2020-07-01 07:37:06,hijtuf,!Remindme 6 months
6256,2020-06-30 21:55:15,hijtuf,"Don't hold your breath.

All the sudden, they'll be talking about 'reconciliation', 'bringing the country back together', and 'reaching across the aisle'."
6257,2020-06-30 17:31:09,hijtuf,Oh the blame game is going to be massive all four years of Biden's office.  Same ol' cycle.
6258,2020-07-01 07:46:05,hijtuf,But then he'd have to learn a language that isn't english.
6259,2020-07-24 17:20:49,hijtuf,"I doubt it. They definitely they're the next political dynasty, but the moment Trump is out, that's it for them. No one is going to campaign for the spawn of Trump. No one will endorse them, no one will fund them. That especially goes for Ivanka and her pallid slumlord spouse."
6260,2020-06-30 18:57:36,hijtuf,Cheers.

6262,2020-07-05 04:05:29,hijtuf,But then he‚Äôd have to admit covid 19 is a problem...
6263,2020-07-01 19:56:48,hijtuf,I wouldn't be shocked
6264,2020-07-01 19:56:22,hijtuf,"Remember when we were shocked that he pardoned joe Arpaio?

Or that he set up concentration camps?

Point is, he always finds a way to up the ante, dude is a hurricane of evil madness and I'm not sure there isn't more to come"
6265,2020-07-04 12:56:46,hijtuf,"It's going to be a shit show no matter what and while I'll be glad if he's gone, I'm not excited about any of it."

6298,2020-08-20 16:26:02,idcziz,"As lame as this is, for me, the strongest argument to vote for Biden is the fact that he's not Trump. For me at least, Trump committed a critical error in his handling of the coronavirus. When I say critical error, I use it in the same way as it's used in driving tests. You can commit six or seven minor errors and still get your drivers license, but just one critical error and you're out. Calling the coronavirus a hoax, mentioning injecting bleach (and just generally talking out of his ass which is not acceptable when talking about something as serious as this), flip flopping on the issue of masks, waiting way too long to impose any protective measures at all, refusing to buy tests when offered by other countries, etc. We will reach 200k American deaths in the next few weeks. That's just not acceptable. I don't care what your political affiliation is. Biden has committed many, many errors and he's corporatist through and through. To be honest, I feel uncomfortable voting for him. That being said, Trump (and the people he's appointed) are even worse. You could do a wholistic comparison and I believe most people would find Biden was marginally better on key issues; however, I don't think any of that is even necessary. I don't care who you are, 200k+ American lives will be lost due to his incompetence. He must go."
6299,2020-08-20 18:57:01,idcziz,"I guess my vote will be based on the fact that Biden is not Trump, but with somewhat different reasoning. Trump does not lead, he misleads. He does not exhibit the basic traits of leadership. He blames others and refuses to take responsibility for anything bad while jumping at the opportunity to take credit for anything good, even if he wasn‚Äôt truly involved. (see: Trump taking credit for [companies moving production](https://www.factcheck.org/2017/01/trump-jobs-returning-because-of-me/) back to the U.S.) Trump‚Äôs administration has seen more turnover among high-level officials than any other President in recent history. I believe that the reason for this is that Trump prefers to surround himself with ‚Äúyes men.‚Äù Also not a leadership trait.

Consider that [85%](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/04/13/and-then-there-were-ten-with-85-turnover-across-president-trumps-a-team-who-remains/) of Trump‚Äôs original cabinet is now staffed by someone else. His ‚ÄúA-Team‚Äù has been discarded and replaced by people that are loyal to him. The problem with that is that the most loyal people are not necessarily the most qualified. If someone else in Trump‚Äôs original cabinet had been able to offer counsel or direction to better deal with this pandemic, the United States might not have the highest number of Covid-19 cases and deaths per capita in the world. Maybe we would have been able to handle this pandemic like England has, or like France has, or Germany, or South Korea, or Japan, so on and so forth. Instead, we have a President that [downplayed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/the-fix/54-times-trump-downplayed-the-coronavirus/2020/03/05/790f5afb-4dda-48bf-abe1-b7d152d5138c_video.html) this pandemic from the beginning, and refuses to lead his people. Any real leader in the Oval Office would have openly criticized the ‚ÄúFreedom to Breathe Agency‚Äù for its harmful rhetoric by now, but that has not happened with Trump.

I suppose what I am trying to say is that I believe that Biden is a better leader. His personality type does not convey the same ‚Äúmy way or the highway‚Äù attitude that Trump‚Äôs personality does, which leads me to believe that Biden is more of a George Washington type of leader. One who listens to the counsel of others and agrees to follow their advice, even when ardently opposed to it. Washington was able to win a war that he should have lost using this style of leadership, even though he was a rather poor military tactician. I believe that Biden will be the same way in office.

But those are just my beliefs, based on the powers of my perceptions."

6302,2020-08-20 18:00:06,idcziz,"Ok well at least your honest. Thank you .

Look I am not trying to defend or praise any one just facts as best as I can deliver ok. 
 For me I voted Trump for the same reason over Hilary .
  Different. Not a life long political cronie.

You say he handled corona badly? 

You do know that the Dems were chasing impeachment during the time this whole thing begain right.

 Congress Intelligence committee was breifed on this in late Jan / Feb during this whole B.S. Impeachment show .

So the Justice committee was suposted to handle the begening of the Impeachment process and pass it to the Intelligence com .

 So the Intelligence committee droped the ball because they were too busy trying to run this bad phoncall scam. 
 
It was their job to deal with this and they were to preoccupied on somthing that they had no business doing . 
 
So Trump handled the corona threat properly almost immediately he said international travel to amd from china must be halted .

 Trump said this in a press confrence and Joe Biden and many other elected officials all Trump was a xenophobe, they said no worried go out enjoy life. 

Many dems said dumb things like this.  Look ot up .

 As for the bleach thing he was clearly joking . 
 If you believ every thing CNN, MSNBC say then you need to go and research these things with you own eyes. 

Tongue and cheek , exaggerations , scarsicm .

 Again I call it how I watched unfolded.

Dr.F and the corona task force in charge of safety and how to get thorugh this said No Mask , then like a few weks later changed their minds and said that mask are necessary.

 So again it wasnt Trump mishandling this virius is was acountability failures from congress , the senate , being pre occupied on a failing Impeachment that  spent hours , tax dollars and time wasted while the pandemic was hitting Wu Hon providence China.

Dem intel committee
Dem Senate
Corona Virus Dr/ Scientist Team 
Dem Speaker Of The House 

Rep intel 
Rep senate

President cheif of staff should have alerted how serious this virius was as well.

 The president acted quickly and ended travel and followed the rules and advice of his Corona Virius Task Force. 

He managed it as best as his team on the ground being the congress and senate did their appropriate job in being breifed on this and considering it not important over the wasted impeachment setup.

Please these are facts check with your own eyes .

Look Trump is not the best but not as off the wall as they make him out to be.
He is a outsider and the career politicions are dinosouars and finally being hit with the bright spotlight showimg just who thet are . 

 Useless we need a entire new congress and Senate . 
My opnion if tiu have served in office for mote than 8 years your out .

This will fix a lot of real issues.

 Thanks for the response . 

These are the people"
6303,2020-08-20 19:29:26,idcziz,"Well put my friend .   Great exchange of views honestly. 
Like I said I dont like either of them . You are right about Trump and all he wants is look at how I fixed the economy. 

Again all I want to know is when is the last time government helped the majority .

Majority= all the poverty check to check people.

Not the 1% 

Government is a lost cause and I dont see how it will go on like this .

People are rioting and standing up against police as they should the system uses the police as there enforcers. 

 Just lile england , king , gaurds, the people under a totalitarian bad rule.  Keep down.


Today this is us this is the real America we jist wamt to stand up and live equal , fulfilling and good lifes .

We need a new order my friend none of these are the right choice . 

Thank you for you insight . have a good day ."
6304,2020-08-20 18:52:20,idcziz,"Watch the press conference where he said scientists were looking into injecting disinfectant. It's not clear at all that he's joking. I disagree with what Fauci did, but the reason he did it was due to a shortage of masks for the health care providers. That shortage shouldn't have existed in the first place. This is where Trump is to blame. He called the virus another one of the ""democratic hoaxes"" at a rally on February 28th. The impeachment proceedings ended on Feburary 5th. The impeachment is no excuse for this. He held campaign rallies which he knew would lead to spread of the virus. There's a decent chance that Herman Cain died due to attending one of these rallies.

The only thing I agree with is the point regarding xenophobia. Yes, generally dems focus way too much on identity politics. That was one of Bidens many errors that I previously alluded to. Also, travel bans aren't required if you implement proper protective measures. South Korea never blocked travel from China.

On a side note, I'm not sure if  you're even being honest. Your writing is full of typos and has very strange phrasing. Maybe your a foreigner using google translate?"
6305,2020-08-20 19:40:23,idcziz,"I assure I am an American , just typing fast at work , ans have terriable spelling . 

I agree with tou on the rallies those probaly shouldn't have happened. 

But the mask thing is totaly wrong . The second I thought about mask hell yes you should wear them .

We cant have experts liei f to the people just to hord mask for hospitals.
 
What is this virius was more deadly than it is and they let millions of people believe not wearing a mask was ok . 
 
And they died due to bad advise from trusted experts . This is inexcusable.

I am tired of the coverage of all this . 

This is the main questions I have for all of them ,  what have you done to make our lifes better in the past say 10 years . 

Real facts , proof, other than Obama Phone I cant tell you a damm thing . 

We need a massive overhaul of government , how long you can be involved in congress , Senate , locked down rules for government abuse , corruotuon. 

The current choices we have mean nothing just the rich staying rich and above the laws and us poor people used and abused by them . 


Lol this whole government , soon I feel it will 100% fail .

6665,2020-08-20 16:51:28,idck2a,"He didn't actually say to shoot twice in the air and it was in reference to using a shotgun.

BUT, your point is valid, the warning shot thing is stupid. Most state law seems to only acknowledge the need to shoot someone dead as the only valid reason for the gun to leave it's holster."
6666,2020-08-20 17:46:18,idck2a,"Technically, warning shots need to be aimed in front of the threat, crossing their path of travel."
6667,2020-08-20 18:12:47,idck2a,"Some states, including mine, have what's called ""duty to flee."" Meaning if you can avoid killing someone by fleeing the situation, you must do so. ""Two shots in the air"" and then killing someone would absolutely be used against you in court as you having the time to flee and you not doing so. In a home defense situation, you can not flee, as it is your home.

EDIT: If the gunowner isn't that good, two missed shots count as ""Two shots in the air,"" right? Asking for a friend."
6668,2020-08-20 18:52:29,idck2a,"Side tangent:

You can ask questions to someone authorized in your state to teach this subject - much more reliable than getting advice from random people on Reddit."
6670,2020-08-22 02:23:06,idck2a,"Also, a shotgun really is not the best defensive choice, buckshot will overpenetrate walls very readily and ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to aim‚Äù is not a thing.  It is very easy to put some pellets through your neighbor‚Äôs walls with typical 00 buck.

At best you have to choose your ammo very carefully. Think seriously about smaller buck like #4 if you are going to do shotguns. Ideally you want a Flite Control style ammo with the shot cup to control spread, but it‚Äôs going to be hard to find the combination of two kinds of specialty ammo.

Despite the appearance an AR-15 is a much better home defense weapon. 223 overpenetrates the least of any round you‚Äôd want to use defensively. Less than handguns even (handguns are big heavy slow rounds with lots of momentum and will go through walls pretty readily as well). 223 is a very light round and tends to destabilize on impact which will prevent it from overpenetrating as much."
6671,2020-08-23 00:20:40,idck2a,"Gun confiscation is possible with the banning of a firearm by type or feature. Please see bump stocks. Please see NJ mag ban. C‚Äômon. You can‚Äôt be serious.

If you pull your shit it should only be for the intent of putting down an attacker. As other posts have mentioned, anything otherwise is considered brandishing.

To *stop* someone, when that's the only way to prevent imminent death or serious injury. Killing may be an unfortunate side effect.

If after you pull the gun the perpetrator suddenly changes his mind and decides to leave, you don't go ""oh well, I pulled the gun already, might as well shoot him anyway""."

If you are a single issue gun voter you either hope Trump doesn't want a quick boost in popularity numbers or that Biden is so swamped trying to undo Trump's mess that they try to go after bigger fish than gun control.

Edit:  Read the bold part.  I don't care if your state chooses to use different words to define the laws.  Pointing a weapon at someone without a right of defense is illegal in all 50.  Let's not get into semantics.  Brandishing, by definition, implies it is an aggressive act."

It's good to discourage people from pulling out guns when not legally or morally justified by the imminent threat of death or grievous bodily injury.

It's bad to suggest that producing a gun obligates you to take a life.  If the threat is ended by the display of a gun, or if the threat is ended by the infliction of a non-lethal injury, then you aren't obligated to shoot until they're dead."

This is incorrect. You should only use lethal force when someone is threatening the life of you or your loved ones. If you shoot at all, shoot to kill.

If you shoot to wound then in court the defense will argue that you didn't need lethal force to begin with and it was an unjustified shooting.

Thus you will actually hurt yourself by admitting you didn't want to kill somebody. If anything, claim that you missed the chest and hit a limb because of your bad shooting."

6722,2020-08-20 18:02:59,idck2a,"My question about this is at what line does brandishing become justified? For example: about a year ago I was pulling into a Chick-fil-A drivethru with my girlfriend for dinner, and the guy who pulled in after me had it in his head that I cut infront of him (I was there a whole 30 seconds earlier). He got out of his car and came up to my widow and started screaming at me and banging on my window that was still rolled up. My gun was in the drivers side door and my hand was on it the whole time. It was obvious that he was not sane at the time and I tried my best to not provoke him and potentially make things worse. My girlfriend dialed 911 and was on the phone with them. At the same time a chic-fil-A employee came out and yelled that they called the cops, and the guy ran to his car and sped off. If I had showed him my gun even though there was a barrier between us the whole time, would I be at fault? Or would he have to remove said barrier before I could do anything?"
6723,2020-08-20 18:01:49,idck2a,"Low ready.

And no, 'brandishing' doesn't exist in all states.

6724,2020-08-20 17:00:08,idck2a,"Not so. My state, for example, does not define brandishing at all. The reciprocity map on usconcealedcarry.com has a field for brandishing and links to state legislature that defines it or alternative laws that the act of showing a firearm in a threatening manner might fall under."
6725,2020-08-20 16:55:07,idck2a,My state doesn‚Äôt have any brandishing laws. However if you point a loaded firearm at someone it‚Äôs a felony.
6726,2020-08-20 17:46:19,idck2a,It really does depend on the state. Here in South Dakota is is legal in any situation that would be considered self defense. Pointing a gun at someone to cause apprehension is covered by the castle doctrine.

I'll be very happy to have him over Trump, but he is seriously garbage on all things justice and I expect to be ripping him a new one on his classist, racist policies for the entirety of the next 4 years."
6730,2020-08-20 17:39:07,idck2a,"No doubt the laws as enforced are racist and classiest, but I don't think the Alexander case above is a good precedent for saying that warning shots are a bad idea because DAs prosecute them in particular.  If Alexander shot and killed her boyfriend the prosecutors probably would have charged her with murder (based on basically the same theory).  Since the warning shot was an effective deterrent, she both defended herself and reduced her legal exposure by firing a warning shot instead of shooting for center of mass.

6738,2020-08-20 17:48:07,idck2a,"From what I understand, shooting to wound is considered ""maiming"". Like you said, using deadly force in a less than lethal manner does not constitute a legal use of deadly force. 

Plus, anyone who's been to a CC class or has even nominal knowledge of firearms knows that in a defensive situation, you always shoot center mass. (Legal argument nonwithstanding, a limb on a moving target is near impossible to hit in a stressful situation.)"
6739,2020-08-20 18:06:13,idck2a,"There's no contradiction there.  One is a statement of law, another of plausible (but not really established) legal strategy.  As a matter law anytime you are justified in shooting to kill you are also justified in shooting to disable.  Either way it's a ""deadly force"" standard.  That's not ""incorrect"" it's literally the law. 

Also, what do you mean the ""defense will argue""? ""You"" would be the defense.  

Exactly what is best in terms of legal strategy is a much trickier question and opinions will vary even among experienced criminal defense lawyers.  Yes, there are some very outspoken defense lawyers that say that shooting to kill is always better (dead men tell no tales, etc), but you will also hear more nuanced views by other accomplished attorneys.  Consider that you can't be charged with murder if you don't kill someone.  So a shot to disable will at most result in an attempt charge (and likely plead to something much lower).  So your ""worst case"" legal exposure will always be lower if you're actions don't result in actual death."

6745,2020-08-20 18:10:56,idck2a,"Depends on your state laws but the general consensus is that unless you're in immediate danger, which, obviously you weren't, you have no right to self defense.

If brandishing or illegal display of a firearm is illegal in your state, this most likely would have resulted in an offence.

6746,2020-08-20 18:17:05,idck2a,"Tough call. Like a lot of carry concerns, it really depends on what a jury/judge feels like. Me, I think even if you did brandish in that situation, that's as close to right as I would expect, even though I'm of the mind that brandishing isn't something I'd do.

The nuances of what constitutes brandishing (the act, not the legal definition) vary so much between states that it would be extremely dangerous to simplify it as ""pointing a firearm at someone when not in immediate danger"". What constitutes immediate danger? Where are you? Do you have a duty to retreat?

6766,2020-08-20 18:41:34,idck2a,"So, you might be slightly uninformed as to what constitutes brandishing. 

Brandishing is typically summed up as: Any display of a firearm or weapon. That has the ability to cause grievous bodily harm. In a manner that would suggest intent to cause fear or intimidation.

When you point a firearm at someone, that is no longer brandishing. You have escalated from brandishing, to threatening of lethal force.

I think you‚Äôre confusing brandishing with, pointing a firearm at a person. They are separate categories and treated as such under law.

Brandishing is an aggressive display with intent to cause fear or intimidation.

Threatening lethal force, is an aggressive display with the means to cause grievous bodily harm or death. This can be verbal threats or posturing such as; pointing a firearm at a person.

Furthermore; no one is arguing with you about whether pointing a firearm at another is a crime. You‚Äôre moving the goal post. They‚Äôre trying to explain to you, that your understanding of what constitutes brandishing is incorrect.

Brandishing means different things in different places and no, it‚Äôs not illegal in all 50 states.

Nope, not at all. That would be a very very ‚ÄúELI5‚Äù understanding of it. There are states where the act of pulling your firearm and holding it by your side is neither illegal nor brandishing. (In a legal sense)

The reason being; is because brandishing by definition requires you to be doing so with intent to cause fear or unlawful intimidation. (For the most part... there are odd statutes in certain places)

So for example. Let‚Äôs say you live in a state where it‚Äôs legal to (for convenience sake let‚Äôs call it) ‚Äújustifiably brandish‚Äù your firearm. One day you are on your way back home from work and it‚Äôs late at night. Boss man made you do overtime. You‚Äôre walking to your vehicle and you notice a man approaching you at a quick pace. As he gets closer you see him take out a knife. At that moment you draw your firearm and hold it at your side and clearly tell the man that you are ‚Äúarmed and you don‚Äôt want any trouble‚Äù.

You would be completely justified in doing so.

Let‚Äôs say conversely this same scenario, but you don‚Äôt see the man pull a knife out, he‚Äôs just walking quickly in bee line fashion towards you. If you pulled your firearm and made the same statement.

You would still be completely justified. 

The difference would be if; you then pointed the gun at the guy who hadn‚Äôt pulled out a knife. That would be escalating to threatening lethal force.

Brandishing is difficult in some places because the charge of ‚Äúbrandishing‚Äù often comes tied to another crime. For example; Robbery while brandishing a firearm. Other places would call it ‚Äúarmed robbery‚Äù. 

>How about this for a scenario: If you pull your shirt over your holster, did you just go from concealed to open carry, but not step over to brandishing? 

Depends on if your state allows open carry, and would also depend on the states brandishing laws.

>At what point does it cross the line?

The line of brandishing is crossed when (obviously) you are actively committing a crime and using the weapon to intimidate. Or you use it to intimidate unlawfully and thus end up committing a crime.

So in this example. A bank robber is robbing a bank, but he doesn‚Äôt have the gun in his hand, he simply shows it to the teller to unlawfully intimidate her/him.

Brandishing would also cross into threatening lethal force based on circumstances. That‚Äôs why in court, brandishing and pointing a gun at someone are two separate levels of escalation. Can you point a firearm at someone with only the intent to cause fear or unlawful intimidation? Yes. However, you can‚Äôt do so without also putting them directly on the other side of the muzzle which is capable of deadly force. So even if you didn‚Äôt mean to escalate to threatening deadly force and you just meant to intimidate, you would still be guilty of attempting to use lethal force and not brandishing.


These laws get confusing. Especially when you consider that all 50 states like to define things their own way. A certain action in Florida may not be legal in another state.

For example in Florida, CCW holders are protected by law from ‚Äúaccidental brandishing‚Äù. ‚ÄúAccidental brandishing‚Äù is defined as; Any accidental or unintentional display of a concealed firearm while otherwise participating in normal or lawful activities. 

You‚Äôre reaching to the top shelf to grab that last can of delicious beans and *oops*! Your shirt rode up, exposed your firearm, and little Timmy saw it!

You would be protected by Florida law for accidental brandishing.

Let‚Äôs say this same scenario plays out in a place like New York, New York (good luck getting a permit there) for example. You would be in way more legal trouble there than Florida for the same innocuous behavior.

Another reason these laws get so confusing is because some carry ‚Äòintent‚Äô behind their meaning and others do not.

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to research your state and local laws and be knowledgeable of them. Making blanket statements about nuances in law and legality only leads to more confusion.

To make things even more confusing, only 5 states out of 50 take the time to legally define brandishing in their state laws and also the consequences of the actions.

Do your state and local law homework people. It could literally keep you out of jail or from losing your 2A rights permanently."

6812,2020-08-20 18:22:07,idcjkj,"No it literally doesn‚Äôt. Involuntarily celibate means being...involuntarily celibate. And trying to make it into a negative thing and give it extra negative connotations feeds into the idea of toxic masculinity. The feminist Liana K makes an excellent point about this

6813,2020-08-20 18:42:51,idcjkj,"I think you know as well as I do that ""incel"" no longer just means ""a man who is involuntarily celibate"". Now it has the connotations of a specific type of man is considered involuntarily celibate. Those connotations came from the long defunct r/incels, which got absolutely dominated by men who were fairly misogynistic, racist, and basically blamed women for the fact that they couldn't find sexual partners rather than doing the self-examination to realize that their own personalities were the things making them less desirable as partners. Saying a man is lesser than other men because he's never had sex is wrong, yeah, but calling a man an incel for acting like the kind of person who would behave like a typical carries a different weight than just making fun of him for being involuntarily celibate."
6814,2020-08-20 20:31:37,idcjkj,"In practice, incels are notorious for EMBODYING toxic masculinity.  You can pretend that the world is just a semantic playground, but the incel community has been extremely vocal and active in demonstrating that they are systemically toxic."
6815,2020-08-20 20:19:00,idcjkj,Nah fuck those kids. We can call em incel if we want.
6816,2020-08-20 18:49:37,idcjkj,"Just because a lot of people on r/incels behaved extremely badly does NOT mean we need to lump in everyone who is involuntarily celibate. Using the term ‚Äúincel‚Äù to put someone down does just that. The fact that people seem fine with letting the worst members of a group define that entire group is Horrifying to me.

To put in another way, I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of People (not just men mind you) out there who are ‚Äúinvoluntarily celibate‚Äù, not because they‚Äôre misogynistic racists, but because of issues like social anxiety. There are plenty of cases of people who have has abusive upbringings or even Kenya disorders who fall into this category; maybe they want to pursue a relationship but find it impossible to do so because of this. Do you really think it‚Äôs helpful for those people to constantly see the term ‚Äúincel‚Äù be thrown around and be treated as synonymous with ‚Äòmisogynistic racist piece of shit‚Äô?"
6817,2020-08-20 20:42:56,idcjkj,"The term ‚Äúincel‚Äù quite clearly refers to anyone who is involuntarily celibate, as it is shorthand for ‚Äúinvoluntarily celibate‚Äù. It is not a specific community of people on reddit or elsewhere."
6818,2020-08-20 20:58:24,idcjkj,"I already covered this--the semantic interpretation of ""incel"" is overshadowed by how incels have interacted in society.  And you're right, they're not very active on reddit (though they make up a large percentage of r/mensrights and r/MGTOW) and are far more active, open, and toxic on platforms like 4chan and 8chan.  

""Involuntarily celibate"" is already an extremely obscure distinction to make in the first place.  

An example would be the term ""anti-fascist"" or ANTIFA.  Plenty of folks who identify as being against against fascism, have different views of people who identify as belonging to ANTIFA.  Agree with them or not, the indisputable component is that the semantics of a term doesn't always give the most accurate portrayal of how the term is viewed in practice."
6819,2020-08-20 21:07:17,idcjkj,"The point I am making is that it is harmful to everyone who is involuntarily celibate, not just the toxic ones, to use the term ‚Äúincel‚Äù as a pejorative. I used to not understand just how damaging it can be until I actually looked up arguments against it.

The fact that this term, in practice, has become a pejorative is part of the problem. What would you say to those men and women who are involuntarily celibate, but who fully understand that it‚Äôs a problem with them and don‚Äôt project the blame onto others, and feel using the term ‚Äúincel‚Äù as a pejorative puts them down or makes them feel even worse than they already do, or lumps them in with toxic people? Because imo it doesn‚Äôt seem all that unreasonable to feel put down in that situation."
6820,2020-08-20 23:40:38,idcjkj,"I get your point. But the problem is that toxic morons co-opted the ""Incel"" for themselves. It's inextricably linked to their shitty ""community"". ( Or whatever you would call it.) And no-one is using ""Incel"" as a dig at virgins. As a virgin who's been and will be confined to their house, I don't relate to the term ""Incel""."

It‚Äôs how the right manages to hijack culture so well and I think it would do the left a world of good to stop ceding ground to these people and just let them co opt anything they feel like.

I dunno man, thinking about it yes he is technically better than Donald Trump 

 like noticeably better just for that reason. But I'm extremely dissatisfied and angry with politics right now. And idk, just. I worry about people becoming complacent or too tolerable just because he's not trump.

Idk. There needs to be open eyes about exactly how bad the situation is.

 and yeah I would have preferred Bernie too"

It's pretty easy to be agreeable if you aren't threatening anyone/thing else. Trump was an exception to this rule, but I think he only got elected because he pissed off Democrats (and partly due to controversy surround Hillary Clinton).

Like Bernie wasn't nominated because he didn't try to pander to older people, and sadly older people are the ones who vote. Biden just kinda stood for nothing, at least in comparison to his fellow Democrats, which is why I think he got nominated."

2016."
6961,2020-08-20 16:39:40,idc1c7,"You better take another look at those polls they have tightened a lot, and earlier than we expected it as well. Texas is now leading forTrump. Minnesota's tied. Wisconsin is tied. From what I've heard Virginia is also competitive, nationally Joe was at 15-point lead now he's at around 6 to 7 percent, So things are not looking good strictly from a poll perspective. If you want a counter example from an earlier election, Roy Moore was consistently leading by around 9 to 10 points until a Fox news poll showed him losing at the very last second, it was that final poll that turned out to be the most accurate.

And the main reason why we don't trust the polls is because we know how the general electorate tends to actually sample out. look at the 2016 exit poll if I remember right it's about 1/3 of each for Democrat Republican and independent, but Democrats tend to be oversampled while Republicans tend to be oversampled in the polls. Even with CNN's polls with a generous Democrat sample they are finding Joe's lead falling pretty fast. Polls really don't tell you anything when the election is close, Even people that have lost massively like Michael Dukakis showed the same lead that Joe Biden did in the same time period. The only poll that really matters in the end is the election polls. The rest are just fodder for the base to keep them excited or depressed depending on who is running them."
6962,2020-08-20 17:14:59,idc1c7,"...  hmmm .... and what of sample bias?  Along with the media coverage, the polls reflect their bias, they have an agenda which has not yet changed from 2016.

It was an anomaly born of circumstances that remain exactly the same today.

The polls were wrong then because people were actively discouraged from pronouncing support for Donald Trump, lest you be accused of racism, sexism, and all other forms of bigotry. 

All that is true today, with the added condition of perhaps being canceled for your trouble.

That being said, **I am not confident either way in how this election will go.** Trump may have turned off those ‚Äúsilent voters‚Äù in the last four years, or maybe more voters show up for Dems."

7055,2020-08-21 01:54:29,idbwd2,"Joe talking to people out of work is so inspiring. I've been out of work for the past 2 months, but this afternoon I just accepted an offer and I'm starting Monday. It's so hard to find a job right now, and I'm a software engineer which one of those jobs they keep telling people to do (something new). It's so unfair what Congress is doing"
7056,2020-08-21 02:18:42,idbwd2,"Btw, if you think Biden ALWAYS forgives, I present to you the omission of Castro and Swallwell from this convention. He doesn‚Äôt mind if you make an argument against him, but don‚Äôt make it fucking stupid like they did."
7057,2020-08-21 02:52:05,idbwd2,The stutter segments and a good speech so far should be the death kneel to people attacking him for how he talks.

7076,2020-08-21 02:47:29,idbwd2,"My stutter only comes out when I‚Äôm really nervous or angry, but it‚Äôs extremely frustrating and it makes me not want to speak out. So seeing Joe talk about his is really important to me."
7077,2020-08-21 03:06:12,idbwd2,Biden giving a large chunk of his speech gassing up Kamala is giving me life rn

7081,2020-08-21 03:13:44,idbwd2,"Joe knocked this out of the park. Man, just imagine if he could have an audience. They‚Äôd be going nuts."

LET'S GO WIN THIS!!!!!"
7083,2020-08-21 03:21:28,idbwd2,That shot of Jill & Joe from behind looking at the fireworks - chef's kiss. These live shots are actually being really well chosen and composed.

7085,2020-08-21 02:05:40,idbwd2,"I'll be honest, Bloomberg should not be allowed to speak. I have a hard time accepting that he was invited. But alas small potatoes."

7092,2020-08-21 02:29:08,idbwd2,Who will be the first MAGA ghoul to say this is fake
7093,2020-08-21 02:30:19,idbwd2,Honest question: Have you ever heard a story about Donald Trump being kind to strangers?
7094,2020-08-21 02:37:25,idbwd2,"Wait, Hunter? Good. I'm glad they're not hiding him. The whole ""controversy"" around him is bullshit."
7095,2020-08-21 02:37:38,idbwd2,Feel so bad for Hunter.
7096,2020-08-21 02:38:25,idbwd2,"Wow, Ashley Biden exists

Had no idea

also Hunter Biden looks exactly like Joe wtf lmao"
7097,2020-08-21 02:43:54,idbwd2,As a Catholic that never went to Catholic school but has heard how awful Catholic school nuns were... I fucking love that story about his mom and that nun.
7098,2020-08-21 02:51:36,idbwd2,I love how Biden is talking about how he'll be a President for those outside of his base. I feel like a lot of people on the right and left have kind of forgotten about that.
7099,2020-08-21 03:03:40,idbwd2,This is one of the better speeches I've ever heard
7100,2020-08-21 03:09:45,idbwd2,Silence is complicity! Yeeees Joe
7101,2020-08-21 03:10:25,idbwd2,Joe is absolutely slaying this speech. I mean it‚Äôs truly incredible
7102,2020-08-21 03:19:30,idbwd2,"God damn, Joe. You knocked it out of the park."
7103,2020-08-21 03:20:55,idbwd2,"We picked the best President and Vice President combination in our party, we executed a novel and competent convention, unemployment is at an all time high and Trump has done a terrible job managing the pandemic by any metric. We should have this thing in the bag absent the pandemic, but you never know. I am feeling good about November."
7104,2020-08-21 03:35:27,idbwd2,So here‚Äôs how Bernie can still win...
7105,2020-08-21 03:38:58,idbwd2,"Joe inspires goodness in people. He makes everyone who comes in contact with him feel known and appreciated. Even Bernie ""I won't wish you happy birthday"" Sanders can't help lighting up with a smile when he's talking about Joe.

I can't fucking wait for the Biden/Harris administration."
7106,2020-08-21 03:59:08,idbwd2,I'd rather be pandered to by the Democrats than slapped in the face every single day by the Republicans.
7107,2020-08-21 00:15:19,idbwd2,"God just imagine what a divisive train wreck the RNC‚Äôs Convention will be next week. Blah. Glad I won‚Äôt be watching it. 

Anyway, it‚Äôs the final night y‚Äôall! I expect a very moving speech from Biden."
7108,2020-08-21 01:12:47,idbwd2,The Chick's still unabashedly support Democrats. Love to see it.
7109,2020-08-21 01:22:18,idbwd2,Omg let Julia Louise-Dreyfus host everything from now
7110,2020-08-21 01:26:04,idbwd2,Oh Elijah. I wasn't ready.

7112,2020-08-21 01:31:39,idbwd2,The Dems knocked it out of the park with this.
7113,2020-08-21 01:55:43,idbwd2,That is some immaculate silver hair
7114,2020-08-21 02:10:33,idbwd2,This is like the saddest video yet. Poor Beau Biden.
7115,2020-08-21 02:11:05,idbwd2,"Goddamn, I thought Beau was going to run for president one day. What an impressive person."
7116,2020-08-21 02:12:25,idbwd2,This convention is almost like a funeral for the America that got killed when Donald Trump got elected.
7117,2020-08-21 02:17:44,idbwd2,"Julian Castro holding his endorsement until sometime in June really did cost him any shot of being included in this convention, huh?"
7118,2020-08-21 02:17:56,idbwd2,This was such a quintessential Amy Klobuchar story lol
7119,2020-08-21 02:20:06,idbwd2,"If Bernie had behaved like this during the past five years, he would be at least 27% more likable than he is now."
7120,2020-08-21 02:21:10,idbwd2,Non-candidate Bernie is so much better than candidate Bernie.
7121,2020-08-21 02:28:06,idbwd2,Get so mad when people make fun of Biden's stuttering.
7122,2020-08-21 02:28:45,idbwd2,This is so wholesome.
7123,2020-08-21 02:28:46,idbwd2,This kid is really courageous.
7124,2020-08-21 02:28:53,idbwd2,Oh my god this kid is so brave.
7125,2020-08-21 02:29:05,idbwd2,"Omg this is so precious. How is Joe this goddamn wholesome? Also, the balls on this kid!"
7126,2020-08-21 02:33:11,idbwd2,I swear to god if Team Trump and MAGAts make fun of this brave kid.
7127,2020-08-21 02:37:28,idbwd2,Oh hell yeah bring on Hunter. Who sounds EXACTLY like a young Joe. Holy shit
7128,2020-08-21 02:42:30,idbwd2,Need to somehow give Joe Biden my cell phone number.
7129,2020-08-21 02:52:16,idbwd2,Joe Biden is the perfect man for this time.
7130,2020-08-21 02:52:55,idbwd2,"I have to say Biden sounds great! This is amazing.

I can't believe Trump and the far-left are still going with ""Something's wrong with Biden.""

They really got nothing I guess"

7140,2020-08-21 01:27:27,idbwd2,Joe Biden organically quoting Kierkegaard isn't something I was expecting tonight. More evidence that his brain is fine. I bet most of the critics have no idea who Kierkegaard is.

7142,2020-08-21 01:45:18,idbwd2,Whew Trump is going to have a meltdown on twitter tonight.

7144,2020-08-21 02:01:17,idbwd2,I'm alright with Castro not speaking. He insinuated that Biden was senile and had disingenuous immgration attacks that were more unfair than Sirota's social security smears.
7145,2020-08-21 02:06:24,idbwd2,"I don't know why the media keeps reporting the TV ratings for the DNC -- they're sort of irrelevant. The YT stream I'm on has 128,653 watching now."

7155,2020-08-21 02:44:31,idbwd2,You couldn't ask for a better contrast to Trump than Biden's extraordinary empathy and compassion. Unironically excited to cast my vote for this man.
7156,2020-08-21 02:45:02,idbwd2,The movie on Biden‚Äôs life is gonna have to be like 5 parts long.
7157,2020-08-21 02:46:56,idbwd2,"It‚Äôs gonna be hilarious to see how the RNC puts together a video of Trump in an attempt to paint his story as ‚Äòinspiring,‚Äô lmao. The contrast between Biden and Trump is so painfully obvious."
7158,2020-08-21 03:04:36,idbwd2,"Guys, I think Joe has done it. He only needed an average speech tonight and he gave an incredible one. We're now only 3 presidential debates away from him being president"
7159,2020-08-21 03:23:46,idbwd2,"I went to Las Vegas on July 4th last year. Went to the fireworks show at the Bellagio fountains. It was absolute balls. 

Imagine being one of those most famous resorts and landmarks in the world, on the 4th of July, and getting outdone tenfold on fireworks by the DNC in the middle of a horrible pandemic."

7164,2020-08-21 01:11:06,idbwd2,Is this being aired on Fox? They got called OUT
7165,2020-08-21 01:11:47,idbwd2,"fun fact about Julia Louis-Dreyfus, she was only 21 when she became a regular cast member on Saturday night live. That's quite extraordinary."

7172,2020-08-21 01:46:32,idbwd2,What a damn shame that we have to spend time talking about the means of voting as a political issue at our convention. I can't believe this is America.

7177,2020-08-21 02:04:40,idbwd2,I just talked to my Grandma in her 80s and she told me that for the first time she thinks that our democracy is at stake in this election. This is a woman who grew up in the depression and world war 2 and lived through the Cold War. Trump really is that awful and has the potential to destroy our country forever

7192,2020-08-21 02:29:26,idbwd2,This kid is brave for putting himself out there and doing this. Some disgusting and awful people are going to make fun of him and I hate that I can say that with certainty.
7193,2020-08-21 02:31:12,idbwd2,"The speech from Braden while he battled his stutter was super touching.

Back then, people didn't groan when the President got brought up. People admired and looked up to Obama, they respected his poise, his talent with words; I knew kids I went to school with who would talk about how they faced uphill struggles and knowing he could become President gave them *hope* that they weren't forever doomed to be victims of their circumstances.

Sure, he's got a slight stutter, but wow, he's leagues ahead of Trump when it comes to his skill at giving speeches and eloquence."

7485,2020-08-21 02:21:53,idbwd2,This segment was designed to let Bernie say that. Well done.
7486,2020-08-21 02:22:44,idbwd2,Nice to see Bloomberg. When he mentions Biden valuing facts he means it. Having the best data is literally how he made his fortune and how he makes most of his major decisions.
7487,2020-08-21 02:22:50,idbwd2,so glad Bernie is doing the right thing now and still so salty that he didn‚Äôt do this 4 years ago.
7488,2020-08-21 02:23:10,idbwd2,No Bloomie. Trump is both a bad guy AND bad at his job.
7489,2020-08-21 02:23:46,idbwd2,I really wish that Bernie had been like this in 2016
7490,2020-08-21 02:24:09,idbwd2,WTF I like Bloomberg right now.

7497,2020-08-21 02:34:48,idbwd2,I'm not digging this reality show music that is going on now.
7498,2020-08-21 02:35:19,idbwd2,I did NOT expect Bloomberg to have the best speech of the night. Gotta give it up to him.
7499,2020-08-21 02:36:00,idbwd2,This segment probably should've came somewhere else in this convention. It feels weird for it to follow the Biden granddaughters.
7500,2020-08-21 02:37:19,idbwd2,I like JLD showing some emotion with the snark.

7515,2020-08-21 03:08:32,idbwd2,I hope Biden goes after China. Joining something like the TPP could help put a lot more pressure on them in relations to human rights.
7516,2020-08-21 03:13:15,idbwd2,You know he knows the Irish poem section by heart.
7517,2020-08-21 03:14:23,idbwd2,"Breathtaking. Just brilliant stuff. We are equipped. We have the tools. If we should fail, then there was never any hope to begin with."
7518,2020-08-21 03:14:41,idbwd2,His speech gives me hopefulness that we can win.

7774,2020-08-20 22:32:32,idbwd2,"I'm going to break the circlejerk a little. I'm glad Bloomberg and Yang are speaking today. 

Yang I was weary about when he started getting attention because I thought he'd be Bernie 2.0 and throw a big temper tantrum but instead he focused on his ideas and actually put a lot of work looking at the data and reasoning instead of it being a big slogan with no substance to purity test and virtue signal with. Instead of labeling his policy something edgy/populist like Make Billionaires Pay he actually did the smart thing and came up with a title to give it mass appeal and as much a shot at passing as possible. Hillary was even a big proponent of a basic income but couldn't get the numbers to work. I actually even ended up getting Yang's audiobook and listening to his Joe Rogan (yeah I know) interview and he made some really good points that I hadn't considered such as the historical failures of retraining programs so far. I don't think the freedom dividend should be implemented now but we need to discuss how to plan for the economy of the future and the answer isn't relying on ideas that didn't even work in the 20th century.

Bloomberg was one of the best mayors of New York. I genuinely liked having him in the campaign because he was the only one who was willing to not enable Bernie or overinflate the opinions of people who are on twitter. He released ads that correctly pointed out every bill Bernie had in office, he mentions how the NRA is how he got in office, his horrible immigration record, and my personal favorite moment was when he said ""America is such a great country, even our most famous socialist has three houses."" Bloomberg looked at the data and brought up uncomfortable truths that most of the candidates didn't want to admit. Nope, angry socialists online aren't the main people who you should dictate policy for. He would have had other problems as a candidate but I'm glad he was in the primary and I'm glad he is speaking tonight. Plus Bloomberg terminals and Bloomberg news are pretty neat."

7821,2020-08-21 01:54:06,idbwd2,That it turned out Bernie‚Äôs success in the 2016 primary was just because sexism has to be one of the hardest of hard to swallow pills

7839,2020-08-21 02:03:00,idbwd2,Trump and years/decades of republican propaganda have firmly rooted the national republican party as against science and not just medical science. It's actually pretty frightening because even right wing leaders in other countries aren't that far gone. The US is the only country not in the Paris agreement for example.
7840,2020-08-21 02:14:45,idbwd2,I heard that Pete won the Iowa Caucus can you confirm
7841,2020-08-21 02:40:14,idbwd2,I really do wonder how he feels about this. It's like his misbehavior caused quite a bit of headaches. If I were him I'd be pretty guilty.

7865,2020-08-21 03:44:24,idbwd2,"I like him. I say this as a New Yorker who lived under his mayoralty and bitched every chance I got. Now I‚Äôd take him back in a  second, and I will never forget the way he spent half a billion dollars just to troll Bernie on the debate stage. He, Pete, Amy, Clyburn, and Beto saved democracy. That outweighs everything else about him for me.

ETA: he was also the most climate-literate candidate, aside from Inslee. Even Steyer isn‚Äôt as informed as he is."
7866,2020-08-21 06:37:41,idbwd2,"Totally agree! Remember the 2012 DNC speech by Bill Clinton? The ‚Äúexplainer-in-chief‚Äù?

I thought Bloomberg‚Äôs speech was effective in a similar way. Especially how he framed these questions. All while a fly is landing on your face.

Would you rehire ‚Äî or work for ‚Äî someone who ran your business into the ground? And who always does what‚Äôs best for himself or herself ‚Äî even when it hurts the company? And whose reckless decisions put you in danger? And who spends more time tweeting than working?"

7873,2020-08-21 03:34:33,idbwd2,Noticed that when I checked in on the politics sub convention thread.

Being president is a hard enough job when things are normal, but cleaning up after Trump is going to be such a monumental task. He already knows what he‚Äôs doing.

Greatest Generation voted republican pretty consistently and then the Boomers got one of their own in (Clinton) and let democrats have the white house again. As much as we like to talk about how they'd be against Trump for his bigotry or fascism that's not necessarily true. They aren't as aware of racial dog whistles as even Boomers.

8268,2020-08-21 01:28:22,idbwd2,"Yes, I want her to be your next Governor, she's ready for the next step. She could clean up the mess Kemp has created"
8269,2020-08-21 01:27:12,idbwd2,Yeah that's the conclusion I eventually came to as well. I think she'll run for Governor in 2 years (assuming Stacey doesn't run)

Liz was the only one on the far right of the spectrum giving it like a 3. And its especially hilarious because the graph was illustrated with cutout photos of the writers' faces lmao so it was just Liz on the side all alone like a petulant child or teenager no one wants to hang out with."

8309,2020-08-21 05:22:45,idbwd2,Boooo
8310,2020-08-20 19:24:27,idbjdk,"It‚Äôs rare to see explicitly pro-Hillary content these days, when the Clintons are in the news at all it‚Äôs usually negative, interesting that Ezra wrote this."
8311,2020-08-21 19:40:36,idbjdk,"All I see in this is a man who's returned to his roots and hasn't learned anything from the Trump election. 

I really thought Ezra would be someone who would learn where his technocratic priors and assumptions had been mistaken in the lead up, and presidency, of Trump. 

instead, he's gone backwards with an eye-rolling piece on Hillary Clinton. 

Another great example was his podcast with Stuart Stevens where he let Stuart make up all this shit on the run-up to Trump, as if the Republican Party Stuart oversaw didn't produce Trump. As if the policies and decisions of BOTH parties led to many people feeling Trump was the only shot at a way out. 

It's ironic that Ezra Klein seems to have fallen back into partisanship. 

Note: I'm Canadian, I detest Trump, this isn't a secret pro-Republican viewpoint."
8312,2020-09-03 14:25:31,idbjdk,"Misogyny in politics and in the electorate is real. Some of it undoubtedly effected Clinton.

On the other hand a statistical hiccup threw the election to Trump. She trounced him by over 3 million votes in the popular vote and lost because of 60k spread out across 3 states. That doesn't mean misogyny is dead any more than Obama meant racism is dead BUT it would seem to demonstrate that misogyny and racism are now handicaps rather than automatic dead ends. More complex looks at the electoral system and the inherent biases of voters are warranted rather than carrying more water for the Clintons."
8313,2020-08-20 21:51:48,idbjdk,"Why is there a constant need to revive a discussion about HRC and why and how she lost? Articles like that are non-news and have been written more than anyone can count. The article doesn't add anything new to the discourse other than to spark a long burning (and quite toxic) debate about HRC. 

America's media, whether leaning right or left, as well as the DNC need to let the Clinton family die one and for all."
8314,2020-08-20 22:41:33,idbjdk,He‚Äôs a big fan. He made a couple videos about how amazing she was in 2016 that have really bad like to dislike ratios on YouTube (of course).
8315,2020-08-25 18:26:36,idbjdk,"Could you explain what you mean? It's not as if Trump won the popular vote, he won an electoral college victory. An electoral college victory given to him by a pro-Republican slant, I might add. Trump didn't win so much as polarization did for propping up a candidate like Trump purely because he was nominated by a major party."
8316,2020-09-08 02:06:52,idbjdk,"Misogyny is a handicap, and so is being out of touch with the people you want to vote for you. I would bet the latter was a bigger factor, but I don't have the data to prove it."
8317,2020-08-21 14:50:46,idbjdk,"Does not adding anything new mean it's been resolved?

I don't think the point is just about Clinton herself. It's about the juxtaposition of an extremely qualified woman being completely torn down in a way that an arguably less qualified man is just not. And this is something we'll continue to deal with for a while.

Warren, Harris, Klobuchar were all hit with lots of bull shit criticisms that were copy/pasted from hits on Hillary. Did all of it apply or make sense? No. But they stuck enough to the point where they didn't even come close to taking out 2 old ass dudes."
8318,2020-08-21 11:56:06,idbjdk,Could you link them? Would be lovely
8319,2020-08-26 18:37:44,idbjdk,"I'm not quite following your point, so please correct if I miss the boat. 

Re: the electoral college, that's the rules right? Everyone knows the rules, and it was recently that Dems were praising the EC and Repubs criticising it (example: https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2012/11/defending-the-electoral-college.html). 

They were the two least popular candidates in modern polling history. But Trump (and Hillary) didn't create polarisation - they were the result of it."
8320,2020-09-08 02:05:19,idbjdk,We needed a legit candidate that wasn't entirely out of touch with most people. We got Hillary. That's why she lost. Does that make sense?
8321,2020-09-08 12:03:50,idbjdk,"Well to put it glibly there were 60,000 more people in those three states that gave us Trump who were cranky about whatever than there were people motivated to vote for Clinton. I‚Äôm sure they had a lot of reasons for it and misogyny was probably impacting how they perceived Clinton but if you think Wallstreet and the broader upper management class are responsible for murdering living wage jobs for people without a 4 year degree then Clinton being a woman is a debuff but it‚Äôs the final straw not the whole pile."
8322,2020-08-26 23:35:39,idbjdk,"I mean, is it actually the case that Clinton was torn down in a way that Biden has not been? Granted, the justifications used to tear down the two candidates might be different, but the actual dynamics in the electorate seem to be very similar. Biden and Hillary are polling similarly at comparable points in the election cycle, even though Biden is running with significant advantages w.r.t. the economy, the coronavirus crisis, and the civil unrest from the George Floyd protests.

As to the criticisms of Warren, Harris, and Klobuchar, they, being (broadly speaking) establishment democratic politicians, can be accurately described and criticized similarly to Clinton, another establishment democratic politician. I'd bet that those critiques, even the bad ones, were far more substantive than your critique of Biden and Sanders being ""2 old ass dudes."""

This should be taken for what it is, not journalism, and not balanced.

If every item in this opinion piece were factual and fairly represented then I would say we should only vote for Biden if the other guy were way, way worse.

Watch actual Biden speeches. Watch his actual acceptance speech tonight. Look at the people around him who support him. Look at the caliber of the people who have gotten behind him. Don't take these partisan hit jobs as reflective of who Biden is."

Q: what do you call the student who graduates at the bottom of his medical class?

A: Doctor...but you don‚Äôt want them doing surgery on you anytime soon. 

Now, in fact, there are safeguards in place with the residency process where the bottom student would likely never get positions that lead to being a surgeon. 

However, we now have a man who graduate 74 out of 85 students at a middling law school (and lying about it) as likely to take the most powerful office in the world.

We've got 8 years experience with Biden in the White House. 36 years in the Senate. In that time, Biden was somehow able to tell fewer lies than Trump has since 2016. I also think they are both bad candidates. But there is no doubt that Trump is worse. He's morally bankrupt. He cares about himself and very few others. Biden may be a sucky candidate, but I don't doubt that he wants to move this country forward (which sadly means putting us back to 4 years ago before we can move forward)."

I predict once the Biden admin begins and he very much drops any pretense of not stocking his cabinet with wall-street lifers, that this new weaponized line of *opposing black lobbyists who didn't have the family wealth to pursue another career is white leftist racism* is going to be the go-to defense by all the establishment Dem bootlickers."

8602,2020-09-07 18:52:51,io8fiq,He was saying that stuff (and btw he went back and forth saying also maybe he was a war hero) because they were feuding and McCain was going after trump supporters calling them crazies.

You want to give powers to the workers? CEO earning caps, mandatory affordable healthcare for every worker if you aren‚Äôt going to implement Medicare For All, expanded mandatory PTO for all workers, mandatory paid sick leave, these are the things that give workers power. 

When you‚Äôre the one in power you don‚Äôt say ‚Äúwe support your fight for the things you deserve,‚Äù you just give them the things they deserve. No amount of supporting unions is going to stop employers from waging counter-union campaigns, union busting campaigns, and fighting every step of the way.

On May 25, 2017, Elliott Broidy texted Rick Gates with a message for Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Broidy, a top fundraiser for Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee, said that China would be willing to increase its cooperation with US law enforcement if the Justice Department deported Guo Wengui, a wealthy Chinese dissident living in New York.

Broidy did not mention that he was in the process of receiving millions of dollars from a shady Malaysian businessman, Jho Low, who had sought his help convincing the US government to extradite Guo.

Steve Bannon was arrested aboard Guo Wengui's yacht last month for defrauding donors related to ""We Build the Wall"".

Broidy tried to negotiate a $75 million fee from the man at the center of the 1MDB scandal if he could get the U.S. to stop investigating the Malaysian state investment fund. Broidy allegedly lobbied to have Guo removed from the United States at the request of Jho Low and a Chinese government official.

Barr is involved with 1MDB - Barr was previously a lawyer for the firm Kirkland & Ellis, whose senior partner Mark Filip now represents Goldman Sachs in the 1MDB investigation. He was given a waiver to participate in the investigation of 1MDB. Politico, 2019: ""The waiver could also give Barr a window into an investigation in the Eastern District of New York that involves the Trump Victory committee, a political action committee dedicated to re-electing Trump in 2020."""

This is the exact sentence that goes through my head every time I try to wrap my mind around the news every single day. In fact, was just about to post these exact words.

It's depressing how our inability to DO anything about it is inversely proportional to the sheer amount of illegal goings-on.

Whether or not the Senate votes on a appointment is their choice to do so as outlined in the constitution. People have every right to cry hypocrisy, yes, but that does not, in any way, justify the denial to answer an honest question about such a massive change to our institutions. 

Politicians are not our betters and do not, under any circumstances get to dictate to voters what is or isn't worthy of discussion. If you want to apply for a job (run for office) you don't get to dictate the questions your employer (voters) get to ask. Your post is a perfect example of being so poisoned by tribalism that any hope of reason is lost. 

And before the ""what about"" retorts that are likely to come, me commenting on how ludicrous it is to refuse to answer this question, is in no way an endorsement of the actions of someone else. I'm commenting on the refusal to answer a question and how that's wrong, if anyone's opponents also refuse to answer questions, while I'll also call that out, that isn't the topic of this post."

8682,2020-10-10 18:02:55,j8mw27,"Tortured might be excessive. He can absolutely deny answering a question. All politicians do it on both sides. It‚Äôs called controlling the conversation. 

I do agree that ‚Äúdon‚Äôt deserve‚Äù is a poor choice of words which I presume is why Biden stopped mid sentence.  Voter do deserve answers. But all politicians choose to answer questions. Especially in an election cycle."

Joe is such a nice empathetic guy. He is a unitier and will be a president for all Americans. Not just the ones who support him. He doesn't get in the dirt. He tells it like it is and is willing to  listen and  change when the situation or the people call for it. He can also say the three words Trump has not, and will not ever say:

Joe Biden is a classic Democratic corporatist, in every sense. There's a reason they called him the ""Senator from MBNA"". Dude is bought and sold completely by the banking and credit card industry. 

There's a reaosn Wall Street is salivating over a Biden win. Cause all they want is a return of their lobbyist money telling the government what to do. The ""public option"" is thier wet dream. Mark my words, they will make sure that any public option to Obamacare will allow corporate employees on it, then 5 minutes after the bill gets signed every corporation in America will announce they are ending employer provided healthcare, pocketing the money for themselves and thier shareholders, and pushing all thier employees onto the Public option. 

You know how WalMart gets shit for paying low wages and telling its employees to get on government assistance? That would go nationwide across every corporation. It would be the greatest shift of corporate expenses from the private sector to the pubic sector in the history of the US. 

Cracks me up when idiots on the left talk about a ""progessive Biden presidency"" like the dude is going to put preferred pronouns on his Twitter bio or something. The single greatest winner in a Biden residency is Goldman Sachs followed closely by JP Morgan."

We all know that if Barrett is confirmed, and the Senate and Pres is blue, there is a higher likelihood of the SCOTUS being expanded.  But that isn't 100% chance. There are also only so many judges that can be nominated, as there are lists of probable Democratic picks just as Trump was suspected to nominate Barrett before it was announced.

Now in 2020, in my heart I am (mostly) liberal, but again will be voting Red for that same reason. I have no idea what these people are planning to do, or how, and they keep changing their minds too. At least Trump says what he‚Äôs gonna do and has an explained plan, whether people fully agree with it or not.

Saying he will pack the court opens a giant can of worms. Suppose Biden loses, now Trump can pack the court himself and Blame it on Biden. Also packing the court only works until the other party takes control which would likely be 4 years later because of the expected backlash from the American public who knows packing the court is bad precedent"
8861,2020-10-10 21:09:54,j8mr0b,"When Merrick Garland did not get a vote the justification was that the Constitution doesn't explicitly say that the Senate has to consider a president's nominee.

He's not wrong. Hanging on to these kind of soundbites is how the GOP is going to get wiped in less than 30-days. We've lost the voters and everyone here is acting like a victim."
8863,2020-10-10 20:23:21,j8mr0b,"I‚Äôm not left, but leaning towards voting for Joe, or maybe not voting for President. I listened to the full clip and think he made a gaffe followed by a fair follow-up, where he said he wants to focus the discussion on the current nomination, which imho the GOP is deflecting attention from because of their 2016 and 2018 rhetoric on the subject of election-year nominations. I think it‚Äôs fair for him to keep focus on the 2020 nomination vs hypothetical 2021 nominations. This question is going to come up every election for the next 20 years the court holds a 6-3 split. It will continue to come up every election if it becomes a 6-7 split. 

I‚Äôm not stressed or worried about it because taking an extreme position like packing the courts will have its own political consequences‚Äîlike, maybe he does do it, and then Republicans get a super majority and pass an amendment to forever limit the court size.

8871,2020-10-10 23:35:34,j8mr0b,"We have 9 Judges on the Supreme Court. ""Packing the Court"" means adding more judges. 

If Barrett is confirmed, there will be 6 conservative justices, and only 3 liberal. Meaning the liberal justices would be easily outvoted on most issues. 

The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land but also has the power to interpret the Constitution and declare laws unconstitutional. 

The idea in our Constitution is that there is a separation of powers between the different branches of government (Legislature, Executive and Judicial) and checks and balances. Packing the Court means adding judges who you expect to overturn the Court's prior actions that you disagree with. So, it essentially makes the Supreme Court completely subservient to the legislature and executive and removes the Supreme Court's ability to ""check"" legislative action. If the Court strikes down an action of Congress as unconstitutional, Congress could just add more judges until they get enough that agree their action is constitutional - this is why ""packing the Courts"" is usually the first thing any dictator does. 

It also sets up a game of chicken where the natural response is for the Republicans to add Justices when the pendulum swings back to Republicans controlling congress and the presidency. If the Democrats increase it to 11, there is nothing stopping Republicans from going up to 13 when they win enough elections. And you create a situation that is politically untenable. This is the stuff secession, civil wars, and collapse of political institutions are made out of. 

Biden won't answer the question because he intends to pack the Supreme Court but does not want to answer any of the very serious criticisms of that move. It's the political equivalent of nuking the Judicial Branch of the government."
8872,2020-10-11 01:45:35,j8mr0b,"Because the Democrats started treating the SCOTUS as a pseudo-legislative body to get around the fact that they couldn't keep control of congress. If Barrett is appointed the SCOTUS the Democrats will lose the SCOTUS for decades, as the court will now heavily favor conservatives. Instead of accepting the results of a democratic election, the Democrats are going to change the rules.

Since the constitution doesn't state that there has to be a specific number of judges, packing the court is perfectly legal and constitutional, and would get around the issue of the court being so heavily conservative.

The problem with this is that it's extremely short sighted. Eventually the pendulum will swing back towards the Republicans, and they will be able to pack the courts. Liberals will, of course, completely lose their shit because it's only acceptable when they do it. Rules for thee but not for me.

And it should be noted that the only reason why Democrats are in this position is because Harry Reid invoked the nuclear option, requiring judge appointments to only require a simple majority. McConnell warned him that it would backfire, and lo and behold, it did. It's what let McConnell prevent Obama from appointing judges, and set the stage for Trump to turn around and fill all of those appointments. We have the shortsightedness of liberals to thank for what is now a fairly conservative judiciary."
8873,2020-10-11 20:32:24,j8mr0b,"Yeah, but the brainwashed folks that are voting for Biden want him to pack the court.  If he says no to this question, it will cost him the chubby white girl w/short blue hair vote.."

And before It gets said, no, I‚Äôm not saying those consequences = conservatives packing the court one day. For me, the problem would be the constantly back and forth packing that would likely happen over the next several decades, devaluing the SC, wasting more time and energy treating political parties like sports teams, etc."

8880,2020-10-11 03:48:55,j8mr0b,"Both times the Republicans followed the accepted precedent. When the president and the senate are of different parties in the final year of a presidency, the vacancy is generally kept open as both sides hope for a favorable election. When they're controlled by the same part in the final year, they tend to confirm justices. This is the way it's handled by *both parties* for over a century, and it wasn't a problem until Democrats started complaining about it in 2016, and now again in 2020, both times in which they're complaining about Republicans playing by the established rules."

Something that RBG spoke out against last year, and something the US and never done because it would make the SC completely partisan. They want to change the rules because they lost last time, and the fact that Binen/Harris refuse to answer is concerning. 

Trump is not doing this, as you claimed he was doing the same thing. He is simply appointing a judge to an open seat. Which has been happening ~~normally forever~~ since 1869.

I can't really pick a point where it changed, but I think we should have a bench where people like Sotomayor and Thomas are considered a bridge too far for the Senate to confirm (yes, hate on me for including Thomas, but they are both just too ideological).

In a way, your post would apply to the GOP 4 years ago. If they'd confirmed Merrick Garland they would be voting this week on ACB to make the court 5-4 in their favor. A 5-4 court is nothing unusual and wouldn't have sparked talk about packing the Court because it's easy to imagine a scenario in which Thomas or Alito passes or retires and gives the court back to the left. By going for the 6-3 Court, though, the GOP took away any hope the left had of gaining the Court through traditional means.

There's a Sun Tzu quote about how you should always leave your enemy an escape route unless you want to find out how fiercely they will fight.

The funny thing about changing the standard to 'well, the Constitution doesn't say we can't' is that there are a lot of things the Constitution is silent about. The number of Supreme Court justices is one of them. 

You're right that we've had 9 Supreme Court justices for a long time. You know what we've had for even longer? The understanding that the president gets to name Supreme Court justices even if you don't like him. Merrick Garland not getting a hearing, let alone a confirmation, was much more unprecedented than changing the number of justices on the Supreme Court.

FDR tried to pack the Courts when the Court struck down parts of his New Deal. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Procedures_Reform_Bill_of_1937

The push for more justices essentially bullied the Court into changing its position.

There should be a constitutional amendment. But, it takes a lot to get one. And the legislature would be limiting its own power - which is rare. Hence why still no term limits despite the popularity of term limits for congress."

And I won‚Äôt excuse that but to say that, unfortunately for Obama, he did not have the senate at that time so his hands were tied. The president has a duty under the constitution to appoint a nominee when there is a vacancy so you cannot fault Trump for making the nomination. You can perhaps fault McConnell for holding the hearings but if the Democrats were in the same situation they would do the same thing. Now, to the Supreme Court packing issue. If Biden wins, and ADDS new justices to the Supreme Court (the true meaning of packing the court) in order to shift the balance of the court, that would be the first time in 150 years we‚Äôve added justices to the court and it would be a purely political move that has far greater consequences."

If a president is in office and a spot comes open he or she should be able to fill it.

Our problem is the way we think we can get there. For example, I do believe we need a universal healthcare program but the AHCA needs to be abolished. It is unsustainable. We need to expand Medicaid and Medicare but pay doctors what they deserve. That‚Äôs just and example but my BF thinks AHCA is great because when he got laid off, he barely paid anything for a family of 6. In my case, I was an independent contractor so I was self insured. My $600 a month premiums went up to $2400 a month. My $2000 deductible per person WBR up to $10k per person. 

Basically you are penalizing the worker in favor of the non worker. 

That‚Äôs what I mean. We just believe there are 2 different ways of fixing the problem. If we can all agree, it would be great but people like Mitch McConnell and Nancy Pelosi have failed us.

I don't understand why you think a city with 10 people should have more say than a city with 100? Middle America would have the exact same vote as anyone else if every vote was equal. Right now, their vote is worth way more simply because they live in a location with more empty land per square mile than another state.

Imagine if people just bit the bullet and we just had a streak of Democrats as president for the last 60 years in the U.S, we would have probably had universal healthcare a long time ago.

This LARPing about how voting is proof that you're ""cucked to the liberal elites"" is literally a queer Twitter anarkiddie talking point. Don't be like that."
9218,2020-10-10 17:56:50,j8mpr9,"Seriously.  I've been voting longer than almost all of you have been alive (based on the survey results), and it's always been the same thing.  They sky is always falling, democracy will always end if you don't vote for the blue neoliberal."

Don‚Äôt let anyone else fuck you around and make you vote for ‚Äúmuh lesser of two evils‚Äù or any other combination of dumb shit. it‚Äôs fine that people want to persuade others to vote for x by giving them information on candidates and policies because being educated on this extremely important. But don‚Äôt let anyone push you into voting for x because of what they want. Take their info and make your own decision. 

Doing anything other than that is allowing yourself to be fucked over by everyone. You‚Äôre being assfucked into putting your support behind someone who you don‚Äôt like all because some other assholes who you probably don‚Äôt like think that they can push you around and make you bend to their will of voting for who they want and who will serve their interests the best. 

This type of shit is going to continue for as long as we keep sucking the dick of the two party system. If there‚Äôs a time to demand this be fixed, now is that time.

Be your own person because at the end of the day, when you step into the voting booth and that curtain closes behind you, it‚Äôs just gonna be you and some words on a screen. Nobody can pressure you, nobody can retaliate against you, nobody can see you, nobody can tell you how to think, feel, and act anymore. At that moment you have full and total control over yourself, so you should act as such."

9224,2020-10-10 20:57:31,j8mpr9,"Points 1 and 2, fine

Point 3 is important to clarify: Trump's explicit policies and orders are orthogonal to most people's interests and in fact will harm a lot of people. I know some, I've donated to some people who would be (or have been) rendered homeless as a cause of some funding that Trump cut. Biden might not harm people as much as that, as quickly as that, as explicitly as that. It is quite privileged (trigger word for some here) to think that Biden and Trump are identical in that respect."

> Nobody has an obligation to vote for a candidate that does not stand for their interests. Such a mandate would defeat the purpose of a democracy. 

People have a madidate to support the outcome for that will help the most people and pressure it to be better. That is clearly Joe Biden. If the two choices are Biden or Trump, the choice that buys us more time with climate disaster and prevents a far right coup is obviously the better choice.

I would argue that the presidency doesn't matter as much as local and state politics which people should be voting for and engaging in and if you are participating in voting anyway, you should obviously try to elect the presidential candidate that will do less damage to the country. This is blatantly obvious. If you can't see this you have no ability to think strategically or you are fooling yourself about accelerationism working."

Yes, because shared guilt is a stupid concept. You can be against those things, but did you drop those bombs? Did you give the order? Did you sign the forms? It's the equivalent of saying a metal manufacturer is responsible for the gun that eventually becomes a murder weapon.

Again not saying you can't be against those things or protest against them, of course, but allowing *possible* guilt to influence your decisions like that can only hold oneself back."

The only real case you can make for Biden is that discarding Trump will lessen the absurd distraction that was the spectacle of his presidency.

They're patriotic Americans; they're not asking for this continued tax cut; they're not suggesting it; but [the Republicans] are insisting on it. 120,000 families, by continuing that tax cut, will get an additional $500 billion in tax relief in the next 10 years, and their income is an average of $8 million.

It's also pretty clear that Biden is not really campaigning on any of these progressive policies so there wont be a mechanism for anyone to criticize him on not working toward these things when he doesnt.

 With that said, I also think the party establishment is deeply afraid of losing their control of the left wing and will be willing to push a couple progressive policies in order to keep power and their banks, private health care, and their military spending.

I'll list progressive policies currently on Biden's website:

Campaign Finance reform, Vague and still doesn't do enough but still pretty good

https://joebiden.com/governmentreform/

Making community college tuition free. He has been very consistent on this and still a vast improvement.

https://joebiden.com/beyondhs/

Expanding funding for k12 education by paying teachers more, hiring more school psychs, social workers, and nurses, tripling title 1 funding which gives money to low income schools.

https://joebiden.com/education/

Banning Right to work. I'm sure this one wont happen but ill still list it.

Not in the same time span.

I think this is relevant due to this particular issue, since we already know we won't be able to revert all the effects of climate change. For every additional degree, we're stuck with a commitment which will last for centuries (which is why, imho, acceleration is simply not an option).

If you constantly vote for the lesser evil you end up in this seemingly inescapable cycle of elections where you have 2 parties that become pretty much the same. You have to get rid of that somehow. Every election people say ""no, we must not vote for a 3rd party, that gives a vote to our enemies, this election is really important"". And people do that and shit doesn't get better. So what if a third party gets 3% instead of 1% and it leads to 4 more years of Trump? Its still a victory for the democratic system.

When its 2040 and people are starving because the blight and frost killed the corn, you have millions of internal refugees because of category-6 hurricanes, droughts and wildfires, are you still gonna say ""We must vote democrats/republicans this election, it really matters guys, don't waste your vote!!!11!, shits gonna change we promise""?

> Yet liberals treat it like a supermarket. You walk in and ah today I am feeling like more of a minarchist, luckily for me there are thousands of bÃ∂rÃ∂aÃ∂nÃ∂dÃ∂sÃ∂ Ã∂fÃ∂oÃ∂rÃ∂ Ã∂mÃ∂eÃ∂ Ã∂tÃ∂oÃ∂ Ã∂bÃ∂uÃ∂yÃ∂ positions that I can identify as. 

I don't know what you mean by this or what it has to do with me.

> These ""online political quizzes"" take the liberal's personality-based approach to politics. You can't just add and subtract points based on how closely each candidate's position aligns with yours. 

Yes, that's exactly what everyone should do.  

What people *usually* do is identify with a party based on agreement with one or two issues, treat it like a professional sports fandom, surround themselves with the media of that party and let it tell them what to believe about every other issue.  Think for yourself.

> Spawned from the supermarket are horrific things like the political compass (and it's subreddit)

The political compass is an oversimplification of what is actually a multidimensional ideological space, but is still very useful for getting people out of one-dimensional two-party thinking (which is what determine's most of redditor's/American's political beliefs).

> horseshoe theory

Also an oversimplification of a multidimensional political space.  When you oversimplify everything by cramming it down to a one-dimensional space, it may appear that both ends are authoritarian and racist, for example, but really they are both at the same ends of the authoritarian and racism spectra in multidimensional space."

In some ways, but not in most.  People in these threads seriously underestimate how bad Republican policies are.  [My policy match](https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/j8mpr9/reminder_do_not_vote_for_joe_biden/g8ct7ld/) with Biden is 80% or 71% vs my match with Trump of 29% or 27%.

Yes, and those people are right.  Third parties don't have enough support to win, even if all of us who prefer them vote for them.  All we would be doing is spoiling the election.

I don't even think you want socialism tbh. If you did you wouldn't be a braindead electorialist who advocates for lesser evil politics. If that is the case then i don't wanna waste my time anymore.

>How fucking retarded do you have to be to believe that giving your enemies more power will somehow work out in your favor? Poo brain nonsense.

Not an accelerationist myself, but it isn't retarded when you spend more than 2 seconds thinking about it.

In WW2 Yugoslavia you had 2 resistance factions. You had the communist partisans and you had the monarchist/right-wing chetniks. The chetniks didn't want to attack the occupying Germans too much because they thought the Germans would just exterminate the Serbs. The partisans instead decided to attack the Germans as much as they could, leading to insane German reprisal killings, leading to thousands upon thousands of people joining the partisans because they wanted revenge on the Germans.

I think you can guess which of the 2 won.

The situation with Trump is different, and I gotta say that I don't agree with the accelerationists on it since it isn't very clear cut. But basically here's how it goes:  Trump would lead to worse conditions for everyone except the upper class, thus leading to left-wing politics becoming more appealing. Think about it. Its not so retarded, but its probably not the smartest move either."

Even Republican Minority Leader John Boener is starting to complain that most health industry contributions are going to Democrats and not Republicans. The cynical calculation is that the Democratic base has nowhere else to go so the way to win elections is to outspend Republicans with special interest money. The problem with the strategy, as the Gingrich revolution in 1994 should remind us, is that a demoralized Democratic base is at least as likely to lead to a low turnout and a Republican victory."

This isn't exactly true. Biden is already like Lindsey Graham. Up until this point, Biden has 100% been against court packing. In the primary *this year* Biden said he wouldn't pack the court.

Biden's not answering now is most likely because yeah, he definitely intends on packing the court and he knows saying as much will lose him some independent or center party votes.

Go to Wikipedia (not a good source for information but for this purpose reliable enough) here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_presidents\_of\_the\_United\_States\_by\_judicial\_appointments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_judicial_appointments)

Under ""All Judicial Appointments"" sort it by the total. Top 7:

1. Ronald Reagan (2 SC, 83 Circuit, 296 District, 383 Total)
2. Bill Clinton (2, 66, 310, 387)
3. Barack Obama (2, 55, 272, 329)
4. George W. Bush (2, 62, 263, 327)
5. Jimmy Carter (0, 59, 203, 262)
6. Richard Nixon (4, 51, 180, 235)
7. Donald Trump (2, 53, 163, 218)

So just statistically speaking, Trump is on par to have appointed more judges than any president ever. If it keeps up, Trump will have appointed 4 SC, 106 Circuit, 326 District, 436 total. That's *IF* Trump gets reelected and *IF* Republicans manage to hold onto control of the Senate for the entirety of his Presidency, which is unlikely. *IF* Trump gets reelected then at some point he's almost guaranteed to lose the Senate and in that case Trump's final total will still be high, but not like, extremely so, and may even be equal to Clinton or Obama depending on how hard the Dems go in blocking nominees.

The worst thing to level against Trump looking at those numbers is that he's got a similar number of Circuit Court judges as Obama, despite being in power half the time. But at the same time, Trump's currently got *fewer* appointees than Jimmy Carter, another 1 term president. The idea that Trump is appointing judges wildly outside precedent or even the norm just doesn't hold up when looking at the actual numbers.

As far as refusing to hold hearings on Obama nominees...so fucking what? That happens every time opposing parties gain control over the Senate in a POTUS's last 2 years. It happened to Bush. It happened to Clinton. It happened to Reagan. Was it as bad? No, McConnell ramped it up. If I'm not mistaken, Bush got like half his last appointees through and the last two years Obama got like a third. End of the day Obama is still the third most successful President at judicial appointments.

I'm not saying the GOP are saints, they're clearly not. I'm not voting for Trump. But to look at the numbers and lose one's fucking mind and defend nuking the filibuster...I don't see it. I think Trump is awful, and I'll never vote for him. But he drove democrats absolutely crazy. These narratives being spun about the GOP destroying the judiciary by...appointing slightly more judges than Obama but less than a previous one term Democratic president...is ridiculous. Democrats didn't win elections and really wanted those judicial appointments so they nuked the filibuster. Now they didn't win enough seats again and are going to pack the court. If they don't win enough seats in the Senate, they'll nuke the filibuster.

Instead of nuking filibusters and going insane, win elections.

9885,2020-10-10 17:04:55,j8lgu6,"> First of all there is no reason for name calling

I mean, there was a little.

>I wrote a readonable question and linked present day scenarios that show the lengths some leaders go to in order to maintain power, and I'm trying to hold a reasonable conversation if/before anything happens.

Your final paragraph is a reasonable question. The first three are not, and taint the reasonable part.

>As others have pointed out I'm not saying he is poisoning Biden. ... a process that has long since been eroded in Russia, and which I do not wish to see happen in the US.

Even here in this response, you are drawing that connection between medical care and Russia.

Biden gets quality medical care. He gets the same care that Mitch McConnell or Nancy Pelosi or Ted Cruz or AOC or Al Gore or Hillary Clinton would get. He does not get the same level of care that Trump gets, or Obama or W or Bill Clinton or Jimmy Carter.

Presidents and former Presidents have, by law, a different healthcare setup than former VPs and members of Congress.

That doesn't mean that Biden is going to get bad, poor, inadequate or compromised care. That doesn't mean that Trump would be able to intervene and sabotage his medical care. It just means that Biden is going to get really good care at a civilian hospital without a Presidential Suite, as opposed to Walter Reed like Trump did.

His specific treatments would be up to his doctors, not the electoral process or justice or Trump. He has a different medical history than Trump, so some of the treatments that Trump got may not be safe for him. He may have different symptoms or a different severity of illness, so he might need different steps.

The idea that any differences in treatment, short of criminal action by his medical staff at the behest of political operatives, is part of a path towards Russian-style assassination of political challengers, is foolish and asinine."
9886,2020-10-11 19:56:08,j8lgu6,"Whether or not you opt for an ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù treatment should be between you and your physician. ‚ÄúExperimental drugs‚Äù could be helpful or harmful.

9888,2020-10-10 17:46:32,j8lgu6,I don‚Äôt understand what your point is. Biden should get medical help. If he needs to be in the hospital he should go to the hospital.
9889,2020-10-10 19:53:38,j8lgu6,"Right, but the question was if he did end up contracting it despite the measures taken.

9890,2020-10-10 16:04:02,j8lgu6,"No, we don't realize it, because we live in the real world and we've seen and heard and read alllllllllll the racist stuff from Trump, starting way back in the 1970's.

He is our president, it's not that hard to send a tweet saying ""I was cut off by the moderator tonight, all strong right wing groups need to stand down. I will not tolerate members using our party platform to endanger other Americans"" and then maybe follow up with sending a barb at Biden telling him to control the looting that is coming from his side of the aisle. Simple as that."
9893,2020-10-10 20:05:34,j8lgu6,"Actually FDA approval isn't the end-all be-all of drug approval. Funnily enough Dr. Fauci has been around for so long that he is to thank for this. During the HIV/AIDs epidemic people were getting the placebo and dying, and for many AIDs sufferers Fauci was public enemy #1. He was withholding drugs as they went through double blind studies, as was thought prudent at the time. However after hearing all the feedback from those infected he adopted a dual pathway system, where once drugs had undergone safety and side effect screening, the drug would be open for purchase for those with severe cases, even though the drug had not yet passed through FDA approval yet. This system saved thousands of lives and there is discussion about how this dual track system applies to coronavirus medications. Dr. Fauci has been around the block a few times"
9894,2020-10-10 16:16:36,j8lgu6,"You're not thinking far enough ahead. Don't stop at ""Biden got covid, he'll get fine coverage from his insurance."" Trump would absolutely use that situation to his advantage. From that point, you start trying to think of what he wants (to win the election at all costs), who he has available to help him (everyone, and he's apparently immune to prosecution as a sitting president), what his behavior has been like in the past regarding sick/debilitated people (awful), and what forces could stop him (pretty much none, and that's why he's a dictator, even though no one has been brave enough to say it in public yet.) 

Trump has zero scruples, and it would not surprise me at all if he tried to deny Biden treatments for covid. Nothing surprises me from him anymore. And what the other guy said is absolutely true: behavior like that brings us incrementally closer to being like Russia, where they slip polonium 210 into your tea for disagreeing with Putin.  This presidency isn't happening in a vacuum - we haven't even begun to see the real consequences of it yet."
9895,2020-10-10 17:13:49,j8lgu6,"See I knew name calling wasn't necessary. You wrote a well thought out and reasonable response, and I appreciate that. Maybe I should condense my statement as you have, should the same therapies be available to Biden as they were to Trump? Not even be given to him or what his doctors decide. But should the therapies such as monoclonal antibodies, which is under testing and in extremely limited quantities, and likely only approved for Trump due to his office also be provided to Joe Biden?

If the answer is no I would like to hear why we are able to provide one candidate with potentially life saving therapies while we are refusing those same therapies to the other candidate. I'm not talking about whether he gets them or not, but whether he is able to obtain them. And I raise that if he is not able to obtain them, when Donald Trump can, then Mr. President is afforded luxuries that his opponents are not. And that he is afforded these luxuries purely due to his office, which I would say is unethical and antidemocratic."
9896,2020-10-11 20:21:44,j8lgu6,"As I discussed in another comment, dual track testing normally allows early access to experimental drugs once basic safety and protocols have been established. And while medical boards don't regulate who can have what drug, a closed study, which regeneron's monoclonal antibody treatment is currently in, doesn't allow for open access to the drug. Trump got access to the monoclonal antibody treatment, which is not available to the public. He got it because of his position of power in the country. Mr. Biden however is not currently in a position of power in the country, he is technically a member of the public. Would you support him getting access to drugs that are unavailable to the general public, drugs that Mr. Trump was able to access through political connections."

9898,2020-10-10 18:35:46,j8lgu6,"Yes I agree, but I'm just saying that liberals have been upset with the level of care Trump has gotten. Mostly due to him getting experimental medications that aren't available to the general public (it's all they have talked about on CNN) If Biden gets sick I think he should be allowed the same therapies that Donald Trump had access to.

9916,2020-10-11 00:03:54,j8lgu6,"Sounds about right coming from a Trumpist. Hey, since you're at wendy's, how's that minimum wage that Republicans don't wanna raise working for you? And what about Trump's tax cuts? I bet you've saved big money with that. Have you gotten covid? Because that will probably qualify for a pre-existing condition, and once Dear Leader scraps the ACA you're gonna be hurting on wendy's hourly pay. At least Trump has a plan - oh wait, no, no he doesn't, after four years. Dang...

Oh, and how about his complete and utter disinterest in whether you and your family lived or died when he insisted covid was a hoax for two months, even though he was aware that it was deadly. He told you to go out and enjoy yourself in the middle of a pandemic, while he got multiple rapid covid tests per day in his hideous gold lam√© quarters.

That's a real man of the people, isn't it? He really speaks your language, doesn't he? Like when he said he was glad there was a pandemic so that he didn't have to ""shake hands with all those people - they're disgusting."" And what Joe 6-Pack doesn't secretly think that soldiers who died defending the country are losers, right? He really tell it like it is. He's ""one of us."" 

He wasn't a millionaire until he was at least ten, so he had some lean years like the rest of us. It's tough making $653,000 last a whole year when you're six. I bet you feel like he really *gets you*, man! He's real. He has a fourth grade vocabulary and can barely read and prefers pictures - I so get that!! And c'mon, what red-blooded American doesn't want to fuck a porn star while their wife is pregnant and then use the money his supporters gave him to illegally pay her off?! I totally get him. I can see why you trust him so much......

Edit: oops! How could I forget his buddy Steve Bannon's little prank with the ""Let's Build the Wall"" GoFundMe!! That was classic!!! Get a bunch of Trump supporters who are living hand to mouth to donate their hard earned money to build a wall that was promised to them, only to have Bannon embezzle all of it? And hey - there are 350 miles of repaired fencing up!! That's gonna be a WALL one day, trump promised!!"
9917,2020-10-10 17:24:58,j8lgu6,"Yeah I know and I didn't take it that way haha, I just like to stop negative terms before they distract from the topic. I understand their use but just prefer to avoid them. And truly appreciated you responding honestly to my comment."
9918,2020-10-10 18:49:29,j8lgu6,You just responded by insulting. That wasn‚Äôt responding to the point he made
9919,2020-10-10 17:22:28,j8lgu6,Wow calling a Republican racist thats new....wouldnt you feel dumb that my cousin along with a good amount of my family is black/mixed ashame thats the first thing you assume.
9920,2020-10-10 17:24:56,j8lgu6,"What about the racist shit from biden? Or do we just gloss over that, or the fact that Biden has negatively impacted more people of color than the other candidates."
9921,2020-10-10 20:25:08,j8lgu6,"It's amazing how difficult it has been. If he truly is sincere, how hard is it to write off a grounded, anti-racist and anti-extremist tweet? Why is that so hard?"
9922,2020-10-11 04:43:57,j8lgu6,"Cut off because he never even tried to condemn white supremacists.

If he was going to be could have. Instead he told them to stand by because they we're needed to fight ANTIFA."

9928,2020-10-11 05:05:02,j8lgu6,"I do think he plays too soft as I have said. He is either inept or uncaring and I don't know which is worse. He needs to condemn it, and he has multiple platforms to do so, but yet failed. I do however still believe that his quote from the last debate needed more space. (Space which he clearly didn't give Biden throughout the debate) All I'm saying is these quotes don't happen in a vacuum as sound bites so often seem to be. I wish they would've allowed him to form his idea, I want to see him fully explain his stance. When your enemy is making a mistake, don't interrupt them. As of now, and as I have stated in previous comments, until I hear/see something else, Donald Trump is either a racist or a bigot who is unwilling to use his position to deescalate/radicalize his party."
9929,2020-10-10 20:39:05,j8lgu6,Why?
9930,2020-10-10 20:18:06,j8lgu6,"Haha, I always laugh when I see that. I do worry though that as a white male if I am trying to have a discussion I can be called out as racist and there's nothing I can do about it. It just detracts so much from a conversation. Like is there anyway to prove you aren't? I know we all have inherent biases, and we all have to work on them, but it does suck being called racist and just sitting there and no matter how you respond being wrong. Just gotta not be a bad person and hope time shows your character."
9931,2020-10-10 18:03:08,j8lgu6,"No, but automatically assuming someone is racist is wrong."
9932,2020-10-10 20:13:43,j8lgu6,"See I agree with that sentiment, but it also worries me. I opposed several of Obama's policies, purely on policy, and I would be told I'm racist. It was so disheartening that I couldn't disagree with someone without being called a racist. I do think Trump is racist, whether it's to the degree some media groups portray I don't know. I do know that there were other conservative candidates in 2016 that were able to separate themselves from race, in a way that Mr. Trump so far has not been able to. I just ask you use caution in ignoring others arguments purely on the grounds of race."
9933,2020-10-10 17:31:00,j8lgu6,He has literally done more for the black community than you are willing to see. Biden has hurt the black community for several generations

Not trying to do a ""gotcha"" just trying to see how what some people would perceive as whether both parties are bad, and it's just the lesser of two evils? Or if you truly don't believe that democrats do also have a negative impact on minority populations"
9936,2020-10-11 04:32:50,j8lgu6,Yet look at the outcome of that bill millions people of color disenfranchised by a system that many were lead to believe would be the solve everything and fix everything bill. Yet clearly history painted a picture very different affecting generations of black americans once again.

9938,2020-10-10 21:38:39,j8lgu6,"They have made some kind of pathetic, backwards stand to protect their right not to wear a fucking mask in a pandemic. They are disgustingly selfish and I'm ashamed that they're American. The fucking **hubris** not to make just one tiny little effort to help us get the virus under control, because the whole fucking country is miserable. 

Side note: remember when the ACA came out, and all of the conservatives started that conspiracy theory about Obama's ""death panels,"" where he would choose which elderly person was going to die? Well lo and behold, here come those hypocrites the Republicans saying that ""only old and sick ppl are dying from covid,"" and then they stood by and **DELIBERATELY LET IT BRUTALIZE BLUE STATES**. As always, conservatives only give a shit about the morality of others, they just do whatever the fuck they want *when it's convenient.* (*Edit: I Will never tolerate another conservative telling me they are ""pro-life"" ever, ever again. They don't give a single solitary shit about anyone else's life unless it allows them to lord their power over a woman and force her to breed. They literally make me sick.*)

So a bunch of science-denying, uneducated, entitled, pathetic examples of patriotism think they have to right to decide to spread the virus around to everyone else. 1) why not, because they care about no one but themselves, and 2) the horror and the indignity of being asked to wear a mask for the sake of others is an affront to their rights under the Constitution. 

They didn't give a fuck about baby's in cages. They couldn't care less about black Americans being murdered by cops. Immigrants steal their jobs! Black people steal their rights - especially Obama!! Uppity women steal their rights by daring to report assaults! Everyone is out to oppress these poor white people!! **They are the only real victims!!!!**They might lose some of their advantages! Their big protest was occupying a fucking welcome center in a national forest or something - ooooooooooh, mighty brave there aren't they? 

So no, I have no obligation to be nice to any of those selfish cretins. They literally don't give a shit if they kill someone with this virus that sometimes exists and is sometimes a hoax. **If they're soooooo worried about the economy and jobs, then they'd put a damn mask on outside so we can get this under control and go back to work!!!! Instead, they're blaming Biden for saying he's open to shutting down if he has to. **EARTH TO TRUMPISTS**: it is **YOU GUYS** who are dragging this bullshit out!! It is **YOU GUYS** who are keeping the country on edge about getting sick. You don't get to first create the problem and then try to be a fucking hero by solving it. 

If they are so spoiled and entitled that wearing a mask impinges their rights then fuck no, I'm not going to be a bit nice to ppl that are essentially assaulting everyone they walk past. They are the worst, most petty, unpatriotic people I've ever come across."
9939,2020-10-11 01:35:33,j8lgu6,Nobody automatically assumed. They read your words and made an educated guess.

9945,2020-10-11 05:19:23,j8lgu6,"In my opinion I don't see it as ""support"" but then again I'm not a radical terrorist, so I can't speak to how they perceived it, but I can 100% rationalize how they would see what he said as supportive of their cause."

I'm a conservative, I want fiscal responsibility, I want checks and balances on social programs, I want responsible taxing and infrastructure support. I never signed up for this... My own party members, my neighbors, would potentially cause me extreme harm or kill my at risk parents, just to avoid a mild nuisance. We were the party of Lincoln and Christianity, and in a few short years all of that is gone. No love thy neighbor, no American exceptionalism, just a bunch of tantruming children with a man crush. How did we get here."

9952,2020-10-10 23:42:22,j8lgu6,"Dude, I felt this comment hard. I've been a lifelong liberal, but I was raised in a large conservative evangelical family, and I feel the exact same way. After I realized how deep my family's sickness and betrayal was, I seriously grieved for a little bit. All my life they presented themselves to me in a specific way, and they were SO strict, SO judgmental, and SO self righteous. My grandma listened to Rush literally every weekday. My grandpa was a mailman for 36 years, regularly wrote snail mail letters to all his elected officials, and taught me that voting isn't a right - something you could do if you wanted - it was a duty. 

But they were so cruel to anyone that wasn't Christian or Republican enough for them. There were strands and strands of pearls clutched in my family about Gary Hart's sinful philandering, and they were salivating at the thought of Clinton getting thrown out for his blow job. When I was 6, my grandma told me my dad didn't go to heaven bc the bible says suicide is a sin. When my very, very close aunt was raped, her parents said she had been asking for it by dressing provocatively and drinking beer. I learned how to tune them out while still looking respectful, bc my mom said I had to be polite about what other people's beliefs were. 

Allllllllllll those years of listening to horrible, cruel things said to other humans because of politics and religion, but I powered through because I love them. 

Now they are all trumpists who bend over *backwards* to defend trump's shitty character when they blamed their own fucking daughter for her rape. I suddenly realized that it was all bullshit. They didn't believe a goddamn word of it - it was for convenience, maybe to have a piety contest with the rest of the church, who knows.

But now I feel like I never knew them to begin with. Like they lied to me all of my life. And over a pathetic, broke, has been real estate disaster, of all people. 

You're right to ask how we got here. How people think the Democrats are actually a satanic pedophile cult, or how people read the Ukraine/Zelensky call memo and pretended right along with the president that it was oh so 'perfect.""

And the thing that bummed me out was the most was when I finally realized around the end of 2018 that a lot of it was because we dared elect a black man president. I can't even explain how profoundly sad and dismal that made me feel. I started to look at my neighbors differently - was she a secret racist? What's he a racist all this time? 

This country just isn't at all what I've always thought it to be, and it breaks my fucking heart."

9955,2020-10-11 00:27:19,j8lgu6,"Dude, it took me way too long to admit that was true. I didn't want to believe it. I honestly thought we were better than that. I can't believe how **naive** I was. In a way I feel sorry for them, because all of their beliefs are based on fear. They don't really stand for anything, they just stand *against* things - a lot of things that are written in the DoI and Constitution, actually. I want to see the entire GOP and Trump and his administration given the full Nuremberg - minus the hangings. I want them to pay a high price for ruining this country that **most** of us love and respect so much."

 We're all humans, we shouldn't be so willing to sell someone down the river just for an ounce of personal gain, but if anything people have been doing more of that rather than less recently. It's nice to be able to take about it though so I appreciate you taking the time to discuss it with me."

I already know what I think, I want to hear what someone else thinks. I like to hear criticism of the Democrats, because it gives me the chance to check in with my beliefs. It depends on the source, obviously, but the conservative podcasts I listen to are great.

9967,2020-10-10 21:53:50,j8lgu6,"Yes and that's why I said I understood the impartiality you were striving for. And they do directly engage in the justice system, each president gets to set their policies and pick what their legal emphasis will be. That's one of their main responsibilities and Kamala Harris will have a huge impact on that. And if history is any indicator she has been very harsh on following statutes even when they disproportionately effect minorities."

The Bulwark has another podcast whose name escapes me, but it is hosted by a woman and is slightly more intellectual than the regular Bulwark. 

To tell you the embarrassing truth, I've missed normal Republicans. Listening to those podcasts reminds me of the talk radio my grandparents used to listen to. And it's also a big source of hope for me - not everyone drank the kool aid. Some people really **did** believe what they said they did, and, even if I disagree with them, I still gotta respect that. 

Do you have any good recommendations? I'm always on the lookout for a good podcast!"
9970,2020-10-11 00:57:01,j8lgu6,"Wanna hear something embarrassing and nerdy about me? I was listening to one of Joe Walsh's Fuck Silence episodes in which he was talking about how patriotic the Democrats were. I actually started crying a little bit.

All of my fucking **LIFE** I have heard conservatives insist that they hold the market on patriotism, and that liberals hate God and America. I've always loved America, and that validation felt really good after four years of the goddamn ""president"" holding all Democrats in open contempt. Goddamnit, I AM a patriot! And I'm a whole HELL of a lot more patriotic than the GOP, who only love America for how much money and power they can rape her for, and for how many illegal immigrants and tax loopholes they can exploit. This was another good thing that came out of this: I'm a fucking patriot, and that tired old selfish hoarding of American pride that the Republicans do is over - just like the party itself. And **good riddance.**"

I preferred Jon Stewart and Colbert back on Comedy Central for their Republican takedowns, it was comedy but almost always based in reason.

9974,2020-10-11 09:55:51,j8lgu6,"Thanks for the recommendations. I'll check them out. You should check out Tyler Cowen's podcast, Conversations with Tyler, and his blog Marginal Revolution. Listening to sensible conservatives like him is reassuring, considering the literal fucking cult of personality the Republican party has become. Trump supporters will tell you that he's not a real conservative, though. According to them, a conservative is someone who worships Trump and wears a goofy red hat. Policy priorities are... ""own the libs,"" I guess? They are utterly uninteresting and boring to listen to."

No I mean her making truancy a misdemeanor, a misdemeanor which punishes minorities and single parents disproportionately. No I mean her declining to prosecute OneWest bank for it's illegal foreclosures, which disproportionately affected low income and minority populations. No I mean her conviction rate increasing by 15% within 3 years of her election as DA. No I mean her opposing a bill that would investigate police shootings and  misconduct hearings with an impartial and non local DA.

That is what I mean when she has a questionable record on legal reforms and a questionable track record of putting forward policies that hurt some of our countries most vulnerable."

9978,2020-10-11 11:02:54,j8lgu6,"Thanks!! I'm gonna give that a listen directly. I feel the same reassurance you mentioned when listening to sane conservatives. The Republican party is dead - just white supremacists and QAnon. I'll be interested to see what the real conservatives come up with, because they have to have representation. 

One of the few good things to come out of this puke-tube of a year is that I have become more interested in what real Conservatives think. Although I'm still a total bleeding heart, I'm genuinely interested in their ideas, and we agree on more things than Fox and MSNBC might suggest. My mind is fully open to them for the first time.

A big factor in that change was simply missing a simple, intelligent, respectful exchange of ideas. You know - like we used to talk to each other all the way back in 2014? The reason I became interested in politics was because of the great conversations it can facilitate. The past four years have just been an embarrassing, high-stakes WWE match. The Trumpists (I don't call them Republicans anymore since, like you said, they became a creepy cult) have devolved into some awful kind of corporate/neo-Nazi/apocalyptic death cult; I've never witnessed anything like this. They have concentrated and fostered the very worst of us, and it makes me incredibly sad. They have constructed an imaginary enemy - some kind of radical communist army masterminded by fucking George Soros, probably, and they are prepared to use violence against that imaginary enemy. All there really is are boring liberals like me, sitting in my carport in a hoodie and smoking a butt while my dog pees. I'm definitely not saying that the left doesn't have bad actors. I'm just saying that the right is coming for *somebody*, and since their enemy doesn't exist, who the fuck knows what real life group the Trumpists will denounce.  

I'm so fucking sick of being held hostage by these whackadoos. They we're going to **kidnap a fucking governor** because they're pissed about covid, and yet a big reason that virus is still out of control is because those same goddamn Trumpists refuse to wear a goddamn mask. **If that is the hill that they are willing to die on, then the rest of their ideology must be piss fucking poor.** 

I'm tired of watching a bunch of petty, hypersensitive, petulant children play Fischer Price My First Government, lying badly right into everyone's faces and embarrassing themselves with their sycophantic kabuki fucking theater.   The Trumpists are pathetic - it's not even vaguely amusing anymore. It's a sad, desperate, poorly acted little display of the right's innermost desire: to be tough, masculine, competent men; avatars of a time when they could abuse and use with impunity, free from the inconvenience of other people's human fucking rights. They are old and they're in the fucking way. (Fyi I'm 42.) All you need to know about how tone deaf and out of touch with 2020 America the Republicans are is how they tried to register Kanye West as a presidential candidate because they thought it would entice black voters. **Get the fuck out of here.**

Every member of the GOP (Trumpists) should be deeply, deeply ashamed and appalled at what they see in the mirror. They can lie to themselves all they want, but they lied to the American people over and over and over again because they think we're stupid and hold us in contempt. For example, this insulting Durham ""investigation:"" every fucking thing they claim to have discovered has been publicly available in the Mueller Report, it's just that Fox knew that Trumpists wouldn't bother to read it. It's an appalling commentary on the media literacy and critical thinking skills of the right. I'm not being glib - it is fucking scary.

If the Trumpists won't volunteer to help un-fuck the Republic, then they can take a fruit roll up and go sit in front of the TV or whatever the fuck - I couldn't care less. The rest of us would like to **finally** tackle covid, begin planning out our economic recovery, and then getting together a legal team so that this whole fucking party can get the full fucking Nuremberg. We're a republic, not fascist ""shit hole country,"" you assholes..."

""In 2010, the crime lab run by the San Francisco Police Department was rocked by a scandal when one of its three technicians was caught taking evidence‚Äì‚Äìcocaine‚Äì‚Äìhome from work, raising the prospect of unreliable analysis and testimony in many hundreds of drug cases. It was later discovered that, even prior to the scandal, an assistant district attorney had emailed Harris‚Äô deputy at the San Francisco District Attorney‚Äôs Office complaining that the technician was ‚Äúincreasingly UNDEPENDABLE for testimony.‚Äù
But even after the technician was caught taking home cocaine, neither Harris nor anyone in her office notified defense attorneys in cases in which she had examined evidence.

‚ÄúA review of the case, based on court records and interviews with key players, presents a portrait of Harris scrambling to manage a crisis that her staff saw coming but for which she was unprepared,‚Äù¬†The Washington Post¬†reported¬†in March. ‚ÄúIt also shows how Harris, after six years as district attorney, had failed to put in place written guidelines for ensuring that defendants were informed about potentially tainted evidence and testimony that could lead to unfair convictions.‚Äù"""

Or can anyone else confirm this?"
10019,2020-10-25 14:39:52,j8lfvd,"Here's another update.

I'd pretty much given up on Mint Mobile. In fact, I wound up buying an iPhone because it was one of the few phones that could do WiFi calling on both my VZW (personal) and ATT (work) lines. I have VZW on the physical SIM and ATT on the eSIM. I've never been a huge fan pf Google's; so I figured if I had to buy an expensive new phone, I'd make it an iPhone.

I then took the OnePlus 7t, wiped the stock OS, installed AOSiP, and am converting it to a car computer. It already has everything it needs for navigation, mapping, email, and of course telephony. (Most of my navigation and mapping apps don't need Google Play Services, and the few that do have alternatives I can use.)

I bought a cheap prepaid number from a VZW MVNO for the data. But just for shits and giggles, I decided to try the Mint Mobile trial SIM in SIM 2 again this morning. Lo and behold, it worked -- including WiFi Calling. I couldn't actually make a call because the trial had expired, but it connected.

The original trial phone number, however, was overrun by bots; so I took the ""permanent"" SIM card and started a new trial with a new number. The Mint Mobile app worked on AOSiP except for the stickers, which I couldn't care less about; and after a brief chat with support to provide my physical address, the WiFi calling worked.

I also have considerably better signal using AOSiP. It ranges from -116dBm to 120dBm depending on where I am in the house; but on the stock ROM, I had no signal at all indoors.

In a nutshell: I'm not going to say this will necessarily work for you; but for me, flashing AOSiP onto the OnePlus 7t (HD1905) made WiFi calling work on Mint Mobile, whereas it didn't work for me on the stock ROM.

Please note that I don't recommend that anyone go and flash their ROM just to make this work. Custom ROM's are a trade-off that not everyone is willing to make. You have to unlock the bootloader (which also voids the warranty); you may brick your phone in the process of flashing it; and even if you're successful, some apps may never work, no matter what you do.

But if you're already into that hobby, I'm letting you know that AOSiP on the HT1905 made Mint Mobile work for me. YMMV.

Having never met a fox who was a liar, I figured it was a number pool problem and tried some other nearby ZIP codes in my county that I knew for a fact had good TMO service, in one case for at least 10 years. No joy.

Yeah, it's a number pool problem. I had to put in an adjacent area code for the compatability checker on the site in 2019. They ran out of numbers for my main area code (not just a mint problem, theres new overlay area codes)

10023,2020-10-12 11:52:54,j8lfvd,"Thank you.

Yes, I looked under ""Enhanced Communications"" in the SIM settings, which I think is where the option should appear. I know it's where the VoLTE option is for the present (ATT) SIM.

I already had the app installed, unless there is another app besides the one through which I ordered the first SIM kit (which finally arrived on Saturday); and I entered my E911 information on the Web site. Maybe I'll pop the SIM back in and try calling support.

I'm also going to be trying both VZW and a VZW MVNO in SIM2 this week, either of which *should* work natively at my address according to my next-door neighbor and my calculations based on Cellmapper data. 

VZW or a VZW MVNO will most likely wind up occupying SIM2 in any case because they seem to have coverage at my home. I still wouldn't mind having a MM SIM in SIM1 and porting the ATT number to it, however, IF I can get WiFi calling to work on MM and IF the data signal in other areas winds up being more stable than it was on the highway by my home. That instability could have been a temporary problem or a peculiarity of that particular spot on the road. I want to do another test on an actual trip.

My reason is that there are places around here where TMO has signal and VZW doesn't. Having SIM's from both VZW and TMO would significantly reduce my dead zones, while allowing me to use the MM number at home via WiFi (which ATT definitely does *not* support on the 7t).

As an aside, the only reason I really care about reducing dead zones is because I'm a volunteer mapper / surveyor for both OpenStreetMap and Mapillary. I couldn't care less about voice service along most of these roads.  I care about the data for my mapping and navigation apps. 911 works even without a SIM card, assuming any signal at all.

10026,2020-10-11 00:10:06,j8lfvd,"Thanks for that.

That's an interesting discussion. I personally like the V20 and could solve part of my problem by just slipping the remaining AT&T SIM into it. I know for a fact that it supports WFC on AT&T.

The thing is I really don't want to have to carry two phones around. That's why I bought a dual-SIM phone. Also, the AT&T signal here is sporadic, not non-existent. I don't know if mid-call hand-offs would occur or how disruptive they'd be if they did. I also think AT&T gave up support on the V20 a long time ago, so there would be some security risks.

I also read somewhere else that WiFi calling isn't supported on Mint Mobile starter kit SIM's, which I find kind of hard to believe. If the purpose of the starter kit is to allow the prospective customer to test the service, then it wouldn't make sense to disable *any* features. The idea is to impress the prospect, not annoy them.

Then again, it wouldn't be the strangest thing I've ever encountered.

The prices for MM are low enough that if it turns out that WFC really is disabled on the starter kit, I might go back to Best Buy and buy a $45.00 ""regular"" Mint Mobile SIM if VZW doesn't work out. If VZW's signal turns out to be as crappy as everyone else's is around here, then it would come down to money.

The other option, of course, would be to build a mast for an antenna and install an amplifier/repeater. It's not hard to do. The problem is that to clear the ridge it would have to be high enough that it would trigger permits (and possibly complaints from annoying neighbors with nothing better to do). I really don't have the patience for that crap anymore. I'm getting crotchety in my old age.

Richard"
10027,2020-10-13 03:06:51,j8lfvd,"My pleasure. It's actually kind of cool seeing something on the map and knowing that I put it there.

Today's Mint Mobile adventure began when I decided to try the first SIM kit I'd ordered, which arrived Saturday. I figured maybe there was a problem with the SIM I bought at Best Buy or with my activation. So I popped the new SIM in and activated through the app.

It stopped responding once it got to the ""SIM Activated"" screen. So I walked toward the highway (I needed the exercise anyway), and caught a signal. Immediately it received two text messages, one from MM with my phone number, and one from TMO telling me I had to download an app to access the voice mail that was waiting.

I went beck inside to provide my E911 information and created a new account with the new number, or so I thought. The number somehow didn't get associated with the account. It was there in my profile, but not as a service number on my account.

Consequently, when I tried to log in through the app, it rejected my login. So I tried the ""forgot password"" link. It said it would send me a temporary password by SMS.

So I walked back toward the highway, and I had no signal. I walked some more, but no joy. Then I noticed the little scroll that said something along the lines of ""SIM2 - T-Mobile - Emergency calls only."" That's the same message I'd get with an unactivated SIM that has signal but has not been provisioned.

When I try to log in on the Web site using the phone number, it tells me I have to complete activation; and when I open the app, it wants to start all over again as if the SIM had never been activated. But the number still shows up as provisioned in the Android settings for the SIM.

My guess at this point is that TMO may be blocking the SIM because the IMEI had recently been used with another trial SIM.

I'm  going to try to start all over again from scratch somewhere that TMO has signal. It could be that something in the routine is timing out in the time it takes me to walk from my house to the highway.

Richard"
10028,2020-10-11 18:04:38,j8lfvd,"They do something special with the trial sims, yeah. can't port out the line and make you use the app to activate. i know the porting thing is necessary because people would abuse it with them just being 99 cents on amazon (like for other carrier's port in promos). I can only guess why they'd lock down wifi calling, but it might also be some cost-saving/anti-abuse measure. Other than Ultra Mobile, which used to be the parent of mint mobile, I can't find any other carriers on amazon selling 7 day trial kit sims like mint does. Probably have to take these measures to keep costs and abuse low or it'd lose them a ton of money. Would be nice if more carriers had a trial kit."
10029,2020-10-11 21:47:11,j8lfvd,I agree that more trial kits would be nice. It's the kind of purchase that you can't really evaluate based on anything other than real-world use.

10101,2020-11-09 16:34:44,jr06zt,"Democratic socialism (Bernie) has a broad definition, but typically the idea is working within liberal democracies to push for democratized workplaces incrementally through legislation. With 'softer' demsocs like Bernie this is usually done through promoting union membership and aiming for a mixed economy as opposed to a purely socialized one, combined with robust social programs to ensure a minimum living standard for workers.

This is in contrast to harder line socialists who believe that incremental changes within liberal democracies is impossible, that the system itself is rigged in favor of the ownership class. In their view the only possible solution is the complete removal of the existing state apparatus and its replacement through mass mobilization of the working class as a political force."

10108,2020-11-09 17:22:04,jr06zt,"You're right, and on the contrary, the promotion of identity politics and culture war issues by the above mentioned groups is antithetical to any type of real socialist project.

Socialism absolutely requires solidarity among the working class, to work together in a shared project. If anything the Democratic party (and to be fair the GOP) has been a very effective in preventing that by dividing workers along identity and cultural lines. Things that are ultimately fake and distractions from peoples real material conditions."

Blm is deepstate organized and it‚Äôs exactly what they are talking about. All the colleges are pushing for it too. 

All the so called socialists advocating for socialism and communism didn‚Äôt get that idea  from nowhere. The state has been actively pushing for this especially with the colleges."
10110,2020-11-09 17:49:28,jr06zt,"Socialism is when the working class controls the means of production. 

We don't have socialism at all in the USA because the workers do not control the means of production. Social programs dictated by the ruling class is not socialism. The military that isn't controlled by the people at all is not socialism. Maybe if the government was democratic and the people actually got to directly decide public policy you'd have an argument for calling those programs socialist, but that's not the world we live in. Elections have essentially zero impact, votes don't make a difference with regards to the policies we get, and the worker gets crushed by both the corporations and the state. Capital decides public policy in practice, and this makes sense if you remember that capitalism rules the world."

I just hope he gives everyone a chance to get some of their debt repaid and it's not all based on government jobs or teaching positions. That would be a huge career change for people that isn't feasible for everyone. And we really need to help out everyone that is suffering under crushing debt.

About student loans. This is only a change of 5 years. 20 years is insane and unacceptable. Many people cannot start families or purchase homes because of this, and the most affected are those obtaining expensive degrees in fields we **NEED** like medical school. Why are we punishing that?

STEM degrees should be free if you complete them and work in a valid field for like 5 years or something. Similar to PSLF, which should also be shortened and less restrictive. Also, they should add the option to forego monthly minimum payments so long as you continue to work in that field and only have to pay back if you quit.

> He would also improve the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, and start a new initiative that forgives $10,000 worth of undergraduate or graduate student debt for every year a borrower commits to national or community service. The cap would be five years.

Just curious. Is there any way around this, or do we seriously have to deal with McConnell denying a vote on anything that comes from the house?"

10269,2020-11-09 18:59:12,jr06ob,It would be fantastic if legislation that addressed health care costs got passed. I don't care if it's a public option or launching existing insurance companies into the sun. I'm so over paying $1000 a month for a family of three.

Be choosy with tax cuts as it usually hurts the little guy and the cuts for the little guy are usually short term. Like all of the income tax cuts we have to start paying back soon. Yea it was more of a loan with a stupid interest rate."

Think of the exact opposite and put it to the republicans for support. 3. Get them on record saying how stupid it is without bringing it to the chamber. 4. Revert to original plan and submit it to the chamber...5. Profit off the republicans opposing your bill whilst opposing their own pre-recorded opinions in secret recordings. 

There is, however, a small chance that they will actually support the batshit crazy opposite plan so may need to rethink."

10306,2020-11-09 19:47:13,jr06ob,We should probably raise taxes.

IMO, if they are able to get to any of these I think it'll benefit all of us."
10317,2020-11-09 20:06:41,jr06ob,All those together seem like a reasonable task. Actually a joke

However, if the Senate remains Republican, Biden will probably not be able to go as far as he would like."

10321,2020-11-09 20:10:47,jr06ob,I heard from a friend that Biden planned on being a one term president. Can anyone back this up? I haven‚Äôt been able to find a concrete answer.

10324,2020-11-09 20:12:15,jr06ob,Taxes should be increased.
10325,2020-11-09 20:12:33,jr06ob,"We‚Äôll see what happens once executive orders start being written and bills are either accepted or vetoed. Would be nice if the man proved me wrong and actually did a good job that made economic sense and stands up against the culture war crap of his own party which is actively ripping the country apart and causing us to not even be able to agree on topics like the right to the first amendment or what words like ‚Äúman‚Äù ‚Äúwoman‚Äù or ‚Äúgender preference‚Äù mean anymore.

I‚Äôd love it if Biden proves me wrong, does a good job, and stands up to those too far on the left. I‚Äôm not holding my breath. We‚Äôll see what happens when the rubber meets the road. Until then this is just pretty promises."
10326,2020-11-09 20:14:35,jr06ob,How does cutting college debt work? How are they planning to address new students? Or is this just a one-time thing? And should I take out student debts for my kids instead of paying for college out of pocket? These are honest questions for how to handle future secondary school for my teenage kids.

There‚Äôs no reason why people should go bankrupt trying to manage paying off their college along with bills and rent . Especially of how high rent has gotten lately
10371,2020-11-09 20:53:14,jr06ob,How is he going to boost health care and social services if he plans on cutting taxes?

10373,2020-11-09 20:56:28,jr06ob,All of which isn‚Äôt possible without Congress. I wonder when people are going to stop with the incorrect preconceived notions about what the President can or can not do.

10379,2020-11-09 21:01:57,jr06ob,All I heard from that headline was cut every other program that isn‚Äôt education or health care
10380,2020-11-09 21:03:26,jr06ob,"I just want the damn health care system fixed.  I am perfectly healthy and my 3 perfectly healthy kids are on my plan (my wife is covered through her work).  My company pays $500 /month towards my plan and I pay the difference. 

&#x200B;

We almost never use it, maybe 1-2 doctor visits a year for the kids for an earache or something plus their annual physicals.

&#x200B;

In 2020 our plan will be over $800/month.  That is rent or a small mortgage.  For a plan that I will maybe use for a grand total of 3/4 of the value of 1 month on a few checkups.  It is the most affordable plan our broker offers and we shop other companies every year.  Yes it is great my work pays for more than half but it goes up more than my annual increase so I will be getting a pay increase in 2021 but my take is going to go down slightly for my part of a health care insurance plan I don't even use.

&#x200B;

The BEST part about our plan?!?!?  The $14,000 deductible.  That is right, other than a well visit once a year I have to pay a shitload out of pocket for prescriptions or other visits/services if I need them before it kicks in.  


American health care is so fucked."

10383,2020-11-09 21:05:44,jr06ob,I think every single president promised the same. Let‚Äôs hope he does. Although I‚Äôm not optimistic.
10384,2020-11-09 21:07:44,jr06ob,Meanwhile here in Washington the Democrats controlled state just increased everyone's property tax by an average of $180.

So Biden is going to to cut taxes (yea - right), increase healthcare spending and pay for education?  HOW?

&#x200B;

Obama said  when running for his first election said ""Any President that allows 6 Trillion in Federal Deficits is fiscally irresponsible""  Under control of democrats left office w/ 20 Trillion in debt.

Margaret Thatcher said it best "" The problem with socialism is that you evnentulalay run out of other peoples money to spend"""

10390,2020-11-09 21:14:09,jr06ob,So he wants to reduce the government's income and make the government spend more ? ü§î With what money ? Does he just want to increase the huuge public debt ?
10391,2020-11-09 21:14:18,jr06ob,"I just saw his message regarding Covid19. I am not a fan girl but, how can we not love this guy! Nobody is perfect but, he cares! He is so presidential, kind and classy. I‚Äôm proud to be an American."
10392,2020-11-09 21:14:54,jr06ob,Bill Clinton famously reached across the isle to work with Republicans and passed a balanced budget and also oversaw 8 years of economic prosperity. It is possible but the Republicans can't do it on their own.

10394,2020-11-09 21:15:26,jr06ob,How is he going to do that if the Mitch McConnell still controls what will and won‚Äôt be voted on?

I‚Äôm not wealthy, but my income is very comfortable for my region and lack of kids, and I could care less about my taxes getting raised for things like healthcare or community investment.  More than likely, I‚Äôd at least break even between what I set aside in my HSA and contribute to healthcare premiums.  If you‚Äôve worked in any of the big industries socialized in other countries and done the research, you know the capitalist model is actually extremely wasteful and way less efficient in comparison.  It‚Äôs just annoying this keeps getting touted as strategy when it‚Äôs just making us pay later and limp along."

10410,2020-11-09 22:23:02,jr06ob,"Progressive taxation on non-retirement capital gains please and thank you. So 401k, 403b, Roth IRA, keogh, etc. all are protected (which is good, they all have annual limits to prevent excessive tax sheltering)

10% up to $20,000 with a $15,000 standard deduction (no itemization)    
15% from $20,000-65,000    
25% from $65,000 to 250,000    
50% from $250,000-1,000,000    
70% from $1,000,000+


The problem is not people making $250,000+ by working. Not only are these people probably the smallest subset of the 1% (outside of maybe lottery winners?), they're usually still working hard for their money. No, it's the people making hundreds of thousands and millions by pushing money around and literally gambling with it in the stock market. It's barely taxed at all, and it's tens of billions of dollars a year. Even big corporate CEO salary is usually only a couple million a year. The big billionaires have all made their fortunes via their stocks."

Wanna bet the GOP are suddenly concerned with how much those same people are being taxed? Fuck the GOP, let‚Äôs make every single one of them who propped him up regret their decision for the rest of time."
10412,2020-11-09 22:32:36,jr06ob,I always loved Biden‚Äôs tax ideas. It just made sense
10413,2020-11-09 22:33:27,jr06ob,Honest to go if he can do just a one of those it would be life changing for me.

10426,2020-11-09 23:41:26,jr06ob,Kinda feel ripped off that Biden isn't giving you a tax cut unless you have kids.

10428,2020-11-09 23:43:30,jr06ob,He can try.  Gotta get the Senate first.
10429,2020-11-09 23:43:54,jr06ob,I worry with the increase in taxes on the middle class starting next year from the Trump tax cuts. I hope he get can do something immediately about it

10432,2020-11-09 23:51:34,jr06ob,"Well, if he can do all of that, then great. I don't expect it to happen, but I expect to see him try very hard to do it."
10433,2020-11-09 23:54:10,jr06ob,"In other news, the Senate plans to NOT cut taxes, boost healthcare, or reduce college debt. Ever."

10445,2020-11-10 01:34:46,jr06ob,Republicans will be infuriated with this.
10446,2020-11-10 01:42:52,jr06ob,That says nothing about reducing our contribution to the military industrial complex.

10448,2020-11-10 02:03:36,jr06ob,They keep taking about cutting college debt but what about the people who really don't have federal loans and its all private? I'm drowning under all the aallie mae debt I have
10449,2020-11-10 02:14:19,jr06ob,"The student debt part doesn‚Äôt go far enough. For folks that can‚Äôt afford their loans they absolutely shouldn‚Äôt be expected to pay them back.

For other folks that can afford to pay them back, they should still get added benefits of doing so. As a software engineer I earn $150,000 a year before stock grants and bonuses. I am happy to pay back my federal and private loans in full. What I don‚Äôt understand is why I get zero tax benefits for holding these loans. What I‚Äôd love to see is the option to pay back my loans, both federal and private, with pre-tax dollars. Businesses can deduct their expenses, it seems silly that I can‚Äôt deduct mine.

That‚Äôs my two cents though. I am excited to see how the mortgage program works out though. Maybe I can buy a house and use my mortgage as a way of getting some deductions."
10450,2020-11-10 02:42:33,jr06ob,everyone needs to lower their expectations. we all know they‚Äôre inheriting a shitshow.

The change of tone from Donald to Biden is so fucking big! How can the GOP still support this clown and why McConnell is still around beats me?! McConnell is the evil that could help Americans but he prefers to see them suffer to simply exercised is power. And he claims to be a Christian 

Guess The President Elect was right: character was on the ballots. America voted now fuck off Donald!"

10459,2020-11-10 07:42:01,jr06ob,"Seriously, everyone complains about the misinformation coming from the right, but here we are pushing a false narrative. No where in this article does it say Biden will cut taxes. Introducing tax credits are not a tax cut. You are still taxed at the same percent, regardless of deductions or credits. Why can‚Äôt we just tell the truth, Biden plans to expand tax credits for the middle and poor classes. That still sounds great to me without having to twist the truth."
10460,2020-11-10 10:42:02,jr06ob,"Love your integrity, Biden!"
10461,2020-11-10 12:59:20,jr06ob,Likely tax cuts on the middle class and tax hikes on the wealthy.
10462,2020-11-10 14:00:32,jr06ob,"I‚Äôve normally been against flat out Student Debt Forgiveness, in favor of some sort of service-for-debt relief program, but we‚Äôre in a serious crisis, and if Biden did forgive debt it would be an incredible gesture to those that elected theme, and would be tremendous relief in a time of financial uncertainty.

There‚Äôs a lot I disagree with Joe Biden on, but if he did this, rollback the Trump tax cuts, got us back into the Paris Climate Agreement, back into the Iran Nuclear Deal, and protected and expanded the ACA, that would be a great step in the right direction for the country.  His pro-Union stances to make it easier to Unionize is fantastic as well."

Biden's plan is predicted to lower GDP and job creation because of the high corporate tax and other restrictions placed on the job creators. Gridlock between the Senate and White House will be good for America, our investments, and jobs.

Joe Biden is a lifelong professional politician. What do grown-ups know about politicians that children do not? They lie.

Just because you voted for Not Trump and won doesn't mean anything more than that.

Joe has been in congress for about half a century. What great achievement is he known for? - You don't know do you? All you know is he's Not Trump.

Do you remember Obama's promise of ""Hope & Change""? That never happened.

>Biden says that he will reduce the debt burden carried by students after they graduate. After deducting the earnings they need to pay taxes and for essentials like housing and groceries, borrowers will pay 5% of their income above $25,000 toward federal loans taken out to fund an undergraduate degree.

>If they've been diligent about repaying their debt, after 20 years, the balance of their loans will be forgiven.

Fuck dude, no way that program survives 20 goddamn years. It'll take one Betsy DeVos to undo it and then you're not even where you started, you're worse off!

>He would also improve the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, and start a new initiative that forgives $10,000 worth of undergraduate or graduate student debt for every year a borrower commits to national or community service. The cap would be five years.

Cool, so work for the government or the army and they'll forgive 10 grand a year. Wasn't there already a plan like this for teachers? And didn't only a tiny fraction get forgiveness? Yup, 94% rejected under DeVos
https://www.theday.com/article/20201022/NWS13/201029853

So even if grads take a job that qualifies now, there's a chance they'll be ratfucked out of the program. I have loads of friends that make barely enough money to stay afloat and make the minimum payments, they're not going to take a low paying government job for 5 years that only MIGHT forgive their debt. My wife has a pair of school loans and has resigned to the fact she'll live with that debt for decades. I've been saving up to repay one of those loans, but if that were forgiven, that money would immediately go to home improvements, a better car, new or better appliances, and the hundreds she pays a month would immediately become disposable income. US student loan debt was 1.6 trillion June 2019. Imagine how many students that is. How much money is being burned on interest.

10634,2020-11-09 20:22:15,jr06ob,"I just did the math. 

I make $350K over $400K, and I'll need to pay a whooping $758.33/month extra in taxes. It may sound like a lot but it really isn't.

That means I earn $29K/month *over* $400K, for which my taxes will go up from $10.7K to $11.5K. Besides, a portion of it is in equity, so I'm pretty sure they aren't taxed immediately and only when they vest.

In the grand scheme of things, people like me can afford to pay a hell of a lot more. I don't understand why people are protesting. Tax me more. Help fix this country and our planet."
10635,2020-11-09 20:46:19,jr06ob,"Yep. If you make 500 *Grand* a year that only increases your income tax burden by an additional $2,600 (a 0.5% effective tax rate increase). Or an additional $15,600 if you're bringing in a *Million* a year (An effective tax increase of just 1.6%). 

Or, of course, no change at all if you were to make exactly $400k a year, a frankly already extravagant salary to your average American.

I'm sure these amounts are somehow going to place an undue financial burden on the USA's multimillionaires."
10636,2020-11-09 21:11:14,jr06ob,"Put it this way. If you make $400k in a year, you have no increase in taxes. If you make $400k + $100 in a year, last year you paid $37 of that $100. Biden is saying you will pay an extra $3. But you already have 400 thousand dollars. You're doing fine.

Put another way (you should not say this): if you don't understand marginal tax rates, you probably don't have to worry about top tax brackets."
10637,2020-11-09 18:54:54,jr06ob,"I was wondering about this, is the extra 6.2% tax (total 12.4%) for social security also marginal or no?"
10638,2020-11-09 19:28:52,jr06ob,Is this individual of household income?
10639,2020-11-09 20:07:17,jr06ob,Theres an additional 12.4% Social Security tax split between employer and employee.  It becomes an additional 8.8% tax above 400k
10640,2020-11-09 20:48:56,jr06ob,"I have a question about this because I know marginal tax rates also depend on your filing status and dependents. So is this saying no matter what your status or dependants it is a 400k cut off. Or would the cut-off be closer to 300k if you are single with no dependents? And 400K is for married and at least 2 dependents?

I only ask because I'm single with no dependents and while I'm not close to those figures I am fortunate to have a good paying over 6 figure job and have friends who are creeping up to 300k. Honestly I don't care too much for being taxed more as I know I'm in the top 90%, but would like to get a better idea of what to expect.

I do hope he adds more tax credits depending on how much you are paying for student loans because those are killing me right now.

Edit: I totally should have read your first link. So it says 207K get taxed at 37%. So for single 207k is that going up to the 39.6%? I'm not there yet but am getting close and will be likely there in a year or two. Again don't mind paying my fair share just want to understand the impact a little better."
10641,2020-11-09 21:26:39,jr06ob,"My favorite way to leverage this is to put how much my household is making front and center and then explain the numbers around my tax rate. I haven't gotten a tax refund in the last 8 years, and I've had multiple years where I've had to pay several thousand _into_ taxes by tax day.

It's done an astounding job making people shut up and think when they realize that I'm usually talking about increasing my taxes, especially when someone finds I make more than they do."

Jeff Bezos's annual income is ~$81,000. The US's wealthiest people already have a dodge for income tax.

Taxing the wealthy is a tough thing to do. If they think taxes are too high, they'll either try to ""influence"" policy to lower taxes, hire a ton of accountants to find new tax dodges, or move to a US territory like Puerto Rico for 6 months out of the year and enjoy a 4% effective tax rate.

If you cover all of their dodges and block their loopholes, they'll move to another country because picking up and moving everything asap is just a minor inconvenience to them.

10682,2020-11-09 20:18:01,jr06ob,"His solution to the debt issue is essentially changing income based repayment from 10% to 5%. From the article I see that interest will accrue as normal for anyone making over $25,000/year. In California everyone with a full time job makes more than 25k/yr. So, yes, you can choose to only pay 5% of your discretionary income every year, but you'll be doing it for 20 years while your debt continues to grow. The fact that you have so much debt will mess with your ability to purchase a house or obtain credit for other things. You'll have to re-apply every year for interest-based repayment and provide the necessary paperwork. Or you can just work your ass off and put your life on hold to re-pay the debt the old fashioned way, in which case Biden's plan does absolutely nothing. 

Oh and here's the fun kicker. You've spent 20 years making minimum income based repayments while your debt grew at 5% every year. You apply for forgiveness and receive two things - a letter saying your debt is forgiven, and a tax bill for 30-40% of the forgiven amount. **Yes - you need to pay taxes on the forgiven debt.**

https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/loans/student-loans/student-loan-forgiveness-tax-bomb

Biden is throwing the smallest possible bone to student loan borrowers. He is kicking the can down the road and nothing more.  A better solution would be blanket forgiveness of a certain amount, or blanket subsidized interest for all, or student loan ""matching"" whereby the government matches any payment you make up to a certain amount per year.

I could imagine a very different world if this had been in place, that money would have been spent on things like a new house, improvements, etc.  My situation would have been better, as would my local economy.  Instead, that money went somewhere else.

And that's not even accounting for the fact that a lot of people don't complete their education, or even complete it but realize the uninformed decision they made about their entire adult life at 18 didn't end up panning out to be where they really wanted to spend their entire adult life.

If anyone tries to say 'what about the people who paid what they owed without help'--feel free to quote me and tell them we (or at least I) support this too."

Hell no.  That was a crushing debt for me.  $435/month, every month, for 12 years (was 10, but I was laid off 3 times during that time and got pauses on payments).  And I didn't go to a top tier school.  And that was only 2 years of school because I had my associates already.  The interest slowly crept up over the years as I watched various Presidents let them expire.  I think my last one was in the 7's.  

Instead of paying off my loans, I could have done so much.  More vacations for the family.  Home improvement.  Heck, even just junk stuff like buy myself some more video games.  

And my payoff was best case.  When I got the loans, I had just left ISAC, who provides loans for illinois.  I 100% understood that if I defaulted paying for 2 months, my loan would go through a bunch of default stages that would make it impossible to ever catch up.  I remember talking to people when I worked there who owed my DoE friends 100K on a loan of 30K.  So I made sure I paid that (undischargable in bankruptcy, thanks Bush) loan every month.  

I cannot clearly explain the elation I feel to not have that debt every month.  I feel like I got a new job.  

I don't care one bit that it won't benefit me - let the kids nowadays graduate and find a career without having a giant bill following them around."

I have been repaying my loans for years and now I'm finally almost done paying them off. I had to make sacrifices in order to pay them off along the way. 

I personally don't think it would be fair to me if everyone's loans were slashed by a large amount and if I didn't get anything. I think they would also need to pay some money back to the people who have sacrificed a lot to keep up with and have paid off their loans. I haven't bought a house yet and I'm in my 30's (and I would have by now without college loans).

>  
>Most immediately, to deal with the economic crisis that has erased millions of jobs and left many Americans struggling to pay their bills, **Biden says he will expand the Child Tax Credit to $3,000 for each child ages 6 to 17, and $3,600 for the youngest children.** That would mean according to his website that a teacher and electrician with a baby and middle schooler would receive $6,600.

And it confirms that he still intends to raise taxes on people earning over $400k per year.

>Biden has repeatedly said that Americans earning less than $400,000 a year won‚Äôt pay a cent more in taxes. But those earning above that threshold will lose their tax cuts and likely pay a bit more.  
>  
>Biden has recommended¬†raising the¬†marginal income tax rate from 37% to 39.6% for the nation's highest pool of earners, according to The Tax Foundation¬†and the¬†Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

Here's the summery for current federal loan relief:
>Under the Biden plan, individuals making $25,000 or less per year will not owe any payments on their undergraduate federal student loans and also won‚Äôt accrue any interest on those loans. Everyone else will pay 5% of their discretionary income (income minus taxes and essential spending like housing and food) over $25,000 toward their loans. This plan will save millions of Americans thousands of dollars a year. After 20 years, the remainder of the loans for people who have responsibly made payments through the program will be 100% forgiven. Individuals with new and existing loans will all be automatically enrolled in the income-based repayment program, with the opportunity to opt out if they wish. In addition to relieving some of the burden of student debt, this will enable graduates to pursue careers in public service and other fields without high levels of compensation. Biden will also change the tax code so that debt forgiven through the income-based repayment plan won‚Äôt be taxed. Americans shouldn‚Äôt have to take out a loan to pay their taxes when they finally are free from their student loans."
10741,2020-11-09 16:15:57,jr06ob,"Yeah, his plan is like the bare minimum. I didn‚Äôt expect much from Biden on this front (see his past statements) but it would be a huge stimulus at a time when it is needed if he could blanket forgive even $25k. He can do that through executive action."
10742,2020-11-09 16:29:14,jr06ob,"Rather than any giveaway, I think something like the **[Depression era CCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_Conservation_Corps)**, etc. with say $50,000 debt reduction for 1 year's service (room & board provided), especially for those who can't find a job even with a degree.

If the government wants to address student debt, I would suggest they look at the **[price gouging practices](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iaJP5VaMQ81U/v1/1200x-1.jpg)** schools use to receive that sweet, sweet government student loan money.

I understand it's been crushing for people, I have seen it first hand, but I can't see forgiveness as the answer.

>**Providing two years of community college or other high-quality training program without debt for any hard-working individual looking to learn and improve their skills to keep up with the changing nature of work.** 

>In 2015, President Obama and Vice President Biden proposed to make two years of community college tuition-free for hard-working students. Since then, Vice President Biden and Dr. Biden have championed progress toward this goal, and hundreds of state and local College Promise programs have expanded access to free two-year or four-year college educations. As president, Biden will build on this progress by enacting legislation to ensure that every hard-working individual, including those attending school part-time and DREAMers (young adults who came to U.S. as children), can go to community college for up to two years without having to pay tuition. Individuals will also be able to use these funds to pursue training programs that have a track record of participants completing their programs and securing good jobs. Importantly, this initiative will not just be for recent high school graduates; it will also be available to adults who never had the chance to pursue additional education beyond high school or who need to learn new skills. And, students who do want a bachelor‚Äôs degree could then transfer to a four-year school, including to Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions that play vital roles in their communities. This plan will be a federal-state partnership, with the federal government covering 75% of the cost and states contributing the remaining obligation. The federal government will cover up to 95% of the cost for Indian Tribes operating community colleges serving low-income students."

Basically, if we do nothing, then we're headed into a recession. One of the ways to prevent or lessen a recession is to cut taxes in the short run. Doing so keeps money moving throughout the economy.

>""How does the government pay for services if it cuts revenues (taxes)?""

The federal government can borrow money. Obviously, this isn't a long term solution, but it is a **good** solution when you're in or headed into a recession. 

Once you're out on the other side, that's when you raise taxes and/or pull back on spending.

>What if the government doesn't cut taxes?

The alternative to not cutting taxes is a longer, possibly deeper recession. Money stops moving around the economy, or rather slows down. Businesses shut down. Investment drops. Unemployment increases.

Paradoxically, even though tax rates aren't cut, government revenues will decrease due to the decrease in economic activity that generates the revenue in the first place."

[Biden's Tax Plan](https://joebiden.com/two-tax-policies/)

* Tax credits that help working families afford health insurance. Biden will ensure that no family spends more than 8.5% of their income on health insurance by expanding access to refundable health premium tax credits. 

* Tax credits that help working families afford child care. Biden will offer up to $8,000 in tax credits to help low-income and middle-class families pay for child care as part of his comprehensive plan to create a 21st century caregiving economy. This is a major expansion of the existing tax credit which could mean up to $6,800 in additional tax relief each year for such families.

* Tax credits that help working families pay for the cost of caring for an aging loved one, modeled off of legislation supported by AARP. Biden will also increase the generosity of tax benefits for older Americans who choose to buy long-term care insurance.

* Tax credits to help families buy their first homes and build wealth ‚Äî up to $15,000

So to sum up, if more than 8.5% of your income is spent on healthcare, you taxes will go down. If you have young children who need care, you taxes will go down. If you take care of an elderly parent, your taxes will go down. If you're buying your first home, your taxes will go down. 

But please, tell us more about how no one's tax bills will go down if Congress passes Biden's tax policies."

Then in 2018, the Republicans took back Congress and Obama's chance for meaningful reform was gone.

Biden and the democrats should say that they want to keep rates on individuals where they are while raising rates on the wealthy, but that McConnell is instead insisting on raising taxes on regular folks so that his big corporate donors can keep their low rates.

I rarely meet someone that even looks at their 1040 after someone else does it for them.

Also, using tax software is still having someone else do it for you (the tax software).  They still don't look at the final 1040 to see what/why their taxes are the way they are.

11003,2020-11-09 23:47:19,jr06ob,"Other people in this thread did some math, but just some quick back of the napkin math here:

Assume the landlord makes $500K per year. Biden's plan would change their taxable income in the $400K bracket from $37,000 to 39,600. That's a tax increase of $2,600. I suppose a landlord could just make their tenants eat that increase, so at that point, they'd just divide it up between all their rental units. Or, you know, be reasonable, quite wealthy, human beings.

Now, here's in my opinion, the hilarious part: I did a quick search, and the average annual income for [a landlord in the US is $97,000](https://www.landlordology.com/portrait-american-landlord-infographic/). I can't speak to your particular landlord, but they'd have to be in the top 1% of income earners in the entire US for this to even affect them. How likely is that?"
11004,2020-11-10 06:05:16,jr06ob,"Is that bad? I thought it was a pretty clear, accurate description."
11005,2020-11-09 22:20:01,jr06ob,"Great questions, and as with most things, it can get complicated to talk about.

The first easy answer is, imagine you make just under $400K, but you have the opportunity to earn $500K next year. That extra $100K will be taxed at 39.6%, which would be a tax of $39,600. So, that means you'd keep $60,400 of your new $100K in income, and the rest would go to taxes. So, the real question is, would you pass up that $60,400 because of the tax rate? And remember, that $60,400 is on top of your first $400K of income, which is taxed at lower marginal rates.

Another way to think of it, instead of in dollars, is in percentages. I crunched some fast, simple numbers with [this calculator](https://equitable.com/retirement/products/variable-annuities/investment-edge-annuity/estimate_your_effective_tax_rate). The tax liability for $400K is $83,445. The tax liability for $500K is $118,160. In percentages, that is a change in your effective tax rate from 20.86% to 23.63%.

One last way to I tend to think about it is the utility of someone's first dollars compared to their last dollars. I think of it as, if you make $50K per year, another $5K is much more useful to you than the next $5K for someone who makes $500K per year. In a lower income bracket, those next extra dollars are going to be spent first on more necessary things (car repairs, food, housing, medical care, etc.) - and I'm speaking from experience here. I think most of us have had those low income moments in life when we had to decide between replacing bald tires and paying rent.

In a higher income bracket, most of those necessary expenses were taken care of long ago, and income beyond that, while still valuable to the individual, becomes more useful to society than to the individual. After all, it's the society that in part enabled the opportunity to make that income in the first place. So from this perspective, what tax rate makes sense and seems fair really requires a decision on the relationship between the individual and the society in which they live. Our society is the foundation on which individual prosperity is possible, and deserves to be taken care of accordingly."

Also Biden being able to reverse most of Trumps executive orders pretty quickly.

In addition, it is not true that Trump got most support from the poorer people. Trump has a coalition of white people across all income levels. At the fundamental level, it is the prejudices which lead to supports of Trump, not education or income.

From [this](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/the-nationalists-delusion/546356/):

>Clinton defeated Trump handily among Americans making less than $50,000 a year. ... The most economically vulnerable Americans voted for Clinton overwhelmingly; the usual presumption is exactly the opposite.

>If you look at white voters alone, a different picture emerges. Trump defeated Clinton among white voters in every income category, winning by a margin of 57 to 34 among whites making less than $30,000; 56 to 37 among those making between $30,000 and $50,000; 61 to 33 for those making $50,000 to $100,000; 56 to 39 among those making $100,000 to $200,000; 50 to 45 among those making $200,000 to $250,000; and 48 to 43 among those making more than $250,000. In other words, Trump won white voters at every level of class and income. He won workers, he won managers, he won owners, he won robber barons. This is not a working-class coalition; it is a nationalist one.

>Yet when social scientists control for white voters‚Äô racial attitudes‚Äîthat is, whether those voters hold ‚Äúracially resentful‚Äù views about blacks and immigrants‚Äîeven the educational divide disappears.

If they could somehow provide that large amount of forgiveness to our monthly payments, then that would be great. 

In my case, for example, I have $350k student loan debt and make a $400 payment each month toward PSLF. Reducing my debt by $25000 while enrolled in PSLF makes no sense, because you basically make the minimum monthly payment for 10 years, after which it is all forgiven.

If it becomes more affordable, then those people you're talking about can have the opportunity to pursue a 4-year degree. But nothing can change the fact that they didn't have a normal ""college experience""‚Äîwe can't go back in time to when they were 18‚Äì23.

11078,2020-11-09 20:03:18,jr06ob,"Administrators, at least those serving public universities, really don't have this sort of thing on their minds. If anything, they want to become *less* dependent on making ends meet via tuition, because tuition funds just aren't reliable (with the impending ""enrollment cliff"" for example). Up till fairly recently, a lot of universities could rely more on public funding and less on tuition dollars to get by budgetarily. Public funds began drying up, tuition increased. A lot of this is on state governments.

If something like the awareness of the possibility of debt forgiveness helps more students attend college and/or complete their degrees, *that* is what will make most administrators ecstatic -- not just out of the love of seeing people learning, but because it helps enrollment and it makes the financial pictures of universities more stable. (And I say this as someone who's in higher education but at the low end of the totem pole and by no means generally sympathetic toward administrators.)"

We really needed this the past few years. We paid 7k to have the first kid, because the ultrasounds to ensure the kid was okay with my wife being on BP meds were apparently tagged as joyriding by insurance. We paid 10k to have the second kid, some of it through insurance fuckery where the hospital split things out so they hit my wife's out of pocket then the kid was on my insurance so we started cutting through my deductible.

We bought our first house shortly after the first kid because we needed more room, there's 30k in downpayment.

Until COVID we were paying 2k/mo for daycare for the both of them, it was pretty horrible. We're now in a catch 22 because we need daycare for my wife to go get another job, but we need another job to pay for daycare. She's taking the time to switch careers since her industry vanished with COVID, it was already strained from the trade war.

We are upper middle class but Trump's bullshit has been straining our finances so hard. I'll repeat that, we are upper middle class, which is rare in this country, we are living relatively very comfortably compared to the rest of the country, and we have JUST barely built our savings back up to where it was pre-kids.

Under current PSLF there is no cap on forgiveness.  Current payments are 10% of your income.  If borrowers want to move to 5% of their income, would they have to give up the cap on forgiveness?  As far as I am aware, there is no answer to that question."

When I was in it, you got $10k for the year, room and board, and a $4500 education award, which was 15 years ago. You could only go through twice and had to be between 18 and 24 years old. I found the program when I was 23, so I only did it once, but I think I would have hopped in it had I known about it in high school."
11105,2020-11-09 17:02:18,jr06ob,"That's more or less what I'm suggesting/thinking would work. Don't necessarily just give a handout. Although I think removing the interest off of the loans so that people are just paying what they borrowed is entirely reasonable.

Just give people a way to ""pay"" it off, including paying with time. But give everyone a chance and a way to be able to do it. Not just the lucky few. Even if that's just $5000 or $10000 a year for doing like 500 or 1000 hours community service (at $15/hr pay that would more than cover what I'm proposing). There is benefit to doing this as there is plenty that needs to happen in communities around the US.

Just cannot stand these people (not pointing at you MesaDixon :), just from other comments and discussions about this) demanding that everyone suffer just because they managed to pay off their loans. As if other people don't wish they could pay them off. Everyone has different circumstances about why they are in the position they are in. We have to be willing to help them, not doom them to deal with it and blame them (most of them didn't even understand what it was they were signing when they borrowed the money). Even expanding this idea to those suffering under crushing home loans would be greatly beneficial to the economy. And that money WILL end back up in the economy. It's not just a blanket forgiveness, there is tons of value in this. And not just in regards to economy but the well-being of people (actual humans to those of you demanding that they suffer for their loans)."
11106,2020-11-09 18:24:22,jr06ob,"Right? The average person making 50k, if you assume 25% pretax for housing/bills and then however many thousands for their grocery bill, plus taxes, plus that 25k, then 5% of that? 

50k -12500 for housing/bills -lets say 4k for groceries -20%~ taxes is already $26k. -25k and they're not making loan payments anymore."
11107,2020-11-09 18:15:56,jr06ob,"It is absolutely a step in the right direction, but we will have to see all the details to make any definitive statements.

As far as ""shouldn't we do something about the cost of tuition.""  In an ideal world, I think all public college should be tuition free.  It would make sense to me to forgive student loan debt and make (public) schools tuition free at the same time.  Obviously, many people will disagree with this.  (Edit: as for why forgiveness is broached more often?  Just the practicality of it.  Forgiveness can be done via executive action.  Making public schools tuition free is just going to be more difficult.)

One thing to keep in mind with lowering the payments is that, given how darn expensive college is, it doesn't actually make the debt go away absent some sort of forgiveness.  

Biden talks about forgiving debt after 20 years.  But man, I really don't like that.  Having potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt hanging over your head for 20 years sucks (yeah - you chose to go to college, yada, yada.  It isn't really much of a choice. The covid recession has shown how advantageous it is to have a college degree).  

The additional problem is lack of certainty that the debt will even be forgiven after 20 years.  Betsy Devos, for example, is famous for denying 99% of people's PSLF applications (which, for reference, is 10 years).  Not being certain that your debt will be forgiven, even if you have done everything right, is incredibly stressful.  Especially if it becomes -- you better hope your 10/20 years is up when a Democrat is president.

All that being said. Absolutely reducing the payments to 5% is definitely helpful and a good thing.  At the same time, I don't think we should stop pushing to make things better just because a potential improvement is in the works."
11108,2020-11-09 18:01:46,jr06ob,Precisely. Same reason the ACA didn't make healthcare affordable.
11109,2020-11-09 19:44:26,jr06ob,"Capping the payment amount is a great start and frees up money each month for savings, car/home payments, etc. But that does nothing to stop the continued accrual of interest - often at outrageous rates - that will just chain borrowers to their loans forever. Personally, I am on an IBR plan which already allows me to pay a percentage of my income rather than the full, excessive monthly payment. But given my income and debt load, that means that my payments only go towards the interest accruing each month. I've barely - if at all - scratched the principal. Further reducing my monthly payment means there would just be more interest accruing and even less interest/principle on a monthly basis that gets paid. Also a $50k reduction in student loan balance does not much for me and many other professionals (doctors, lawyers, etc) who have to take on hundreds of thousands of dollars to perform their professions. 

With all that being said, I won't shake my fist at this going into effect. As long as my monthly payments are reasonable going forward and the PSLF is still there in 10 years when I will fully qualify, I won't feel like I am flushing my money down the toilet every month."

11122,2020-11-09 17:02:17,jr06ob,Why would you ever go 100k in debt to make peanuts?
11123,2020-11-09 22:27:29,jr06ob,"Exactly. I know Biden also proposes to reduce the hardship requirements for bankruptcy. That would go a long way in siphoning off the unlimited money supply from private banks that make up the difference where federal loans stop.  

I graduated college in 08. The last year of school, my college increased tuition by $10k a semester. But at that point what was I going to do? Transfer my senior year and get a degree from a different school after already spending nearly $100k.  It was an easy decision to pay the extra $20k because Discover Bank was more than happy to give me the money no questions asked. 

If the federal government capped the amount of federal loans per year and eliminated the hardship requirement in bankruptcy, people would have to actually come up with the money themselves. They wouldn‚Äôt be able to get he extra $20k from a private bank. Then these schools would reconsider increasing tuition ever year."

Also, your ideas would drastically change debt going forward - why punish those who weren't privvy to those programs because they weren't available? By your own reasoning, aren't those people getting 2 free years and massive incentives ""getting a handout"" ? Why should a graduate from 2013 have 6 figures of debt when someone choosing the same university and path, under your plan, would have a fraction of that in 2020? Does the 2013 graduate need to learn the lesson 10x as hard or something?"
11125,2020-11-09 20:05:14,jr06ob,So people in countries with free college are less financially responsible? That's really fucking stupid. Debt is a revenue stream for finance sector oligarchs and nothing else.

The main difference is that you will be paying into a national healthcare fund (through taxes) instead of to an insurance company. If you read the Medicare for all legislation you‚Äôd also discover that if you already have healthcare through your work, your employer will be required to pay this tax on your behalf (just like they do with insurance). The benefit? No co pays, no deductibles, no insurance adjusters determining how much you will owe the hospital. Everyone is covered. They have this exact system in many other countries, and it works far better than the United States for profit system."

From 2007-2013, Labor (left / workers' rights) government racked up AUD $250 billion (USD $181 billion) in debt from spending/stimulus to keep Australia's economy going during the GFC. And it worked - we didn't go into recession (albeit this was also due to China buying our minerals).

Liberals / Nationals were elected based on a ""Labor's debt"" scare campaign. They even sold mugs saying ""back in black"" (meaning back in credit, as opposed to red deficit).

Then they promptly **doubled the debt to AUD $500 billion** (USD $363 billion). And now after 7 years in government it stands at **over AUD $800 billion** (USD $582 billion).

Labor racked up $2 or so billion in debt during the GFC, while other nations economically imploded, they invested that money and got us through it. 

Now we're nearing a trillion in debt. So, hundreds of billions in debt thanks to the LNP handing off billions to their mates in the mining and coal industry, but its ""labor's debt"" because they needed to spend money to get us through a global financial collapse."

It is my belief that the hold values that hold bother parties together are going to die, and be replaces with something more relevant. It's my hope that we eventually have more than two parties, and do something similar to how Swedish politics work. Essentially, the parties with the most votes assimilate other parties for the purpose of electing an official, and that elected official has to honor the points of the parties it assimilated."

Their promises of less government and unfettered business regulations has translated for all sorts of environmental and labor abuses.

This is the greatest lie in politics that‚Äôs been told in our time. Republicans support the idea of you having as much control over your own life as possible where your have as much freedom to invest in yourself as possible. We believe you should be able to take risks without unnecessary bureaucracy standing in your way, and that if you fail you should have the ability to try again. We believe in small business owners, letting people live however they wish so long as it‚Äôs law abiding, and letting people have the power to dictate the outcomes of their own lives instead of locking them under a predetermined ceiling of success and growth via programs like welfare, or imposing our personal ideas of what‚Äôs right and wrong culturally on people. We believe in religious freedom, as long as you keep it separate from public schools and government. We believe in a fully free market because it gives everybody more opportunity for success. We believe in complex answers to difficult problems that factor in both raw science and economics.

Donald Trump would not have had the second most votes of any presidential candidate in history (yes even more than Obama) just now if the Republican Party only cared about shareholders and not everyday people. I grew up in SoCal and know firsthand that the ideas on the left that will make people successful and happy are completely different from ours. Doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt want the same thing. We just have very different beliefs on what works and what doesn‚Äôt."

Half the Dem candidates for President supported M4A. It was a major feature of Dem congressional campaigns in 2018 and has been credited as the main reason so many Dems won in that midterm. It‚Äôs not universal but only because the rest of the Dems think you can expand coverage without it."
11246,2020-11-09 19:22:45,jr06ob,"yea, obviously.... They'll claim the tax cuts they did were different because the growth made up for it (which is not true, at all).  Just watch, they already have started."

Unfortunately too many flocked to that deal and it sure sounds like getting sucked into credit card debt."

There was also an initiative to score educational institutions based on student loan payback rates. The lowest scoring schools would no longer be eligible for federally guaranteed student loans. The for profit education industry managed to kill most of this in Congress.

Students attending for profit private schools are by far the most likely to default on student loans. They often get a subpar education while paying high tuition rates."

Pretty much. The very abridged version of how we became so polarized is basically this: For the first half of the 20th century, most American politicians were different flavors of moderate liberals. Then the Republican party began moving further to the right, at first slowly in the 60s and 70s, then very quickly in the 80s and 90s. The Dems, at this point were still very moderate and willing to compromise, but as the GOP moved further right they also began playing the hardball politics that the party is known for today, and compromising with them slowly moved the American ""center"" to the right. Now after 8 years of Bush/Cheney committing war crimes in the middle east, 8 years of Obama being unable to do much of anything because of a Republican congress, 4 years of Trump attempting to dismantle any form of executive accountability, and 2 recessions, the Dems are radicalizing in the same way the GOP did in the 80s in an attempt to yank things back to the left.

11267,2020-11-09 22:01:21,jr06ob,Nah lots of people have fed loans. Most people with private loans also have fed loans. It would have helped a lot of people. Not hating on Obama.

You are both exonerated and your friend is released 10 years earlier than his sentence.

You shouldn‚Äôt have to have a masters in engineering and a 6 figure job just to service the debts you took on to get your job. This shouldn‚Äôt be what it takes. A teacher should be able to pay their debts. A social worker should be able to pay their debts.

Most mega-rich people do not make income but instead capital gains (think Bezos selling Amazon stock). People making ~400k income are usually high earning _working_ people, e.g. couples @ 200k each in high earning fields like medicine, software,  business owners, etc., likely living in HCOL areas.   

This tax change will mean that Bezos will no longer pay a lower tax rate than I do."

11289,2020-11-10 02:55:33,jr06ob,I think it is very much by design that people are not encouraged to understand marginal tax rates or do their own taxes.

11291,2020-11-09 22:24:11,jr06ob,"And bear in mind that I also make the $400K - the $350K is over and above what I make to illustrate the impact of the marginal tax rate.

To put it bluntly, my take home pay every month is ~$20K+ after taxes and insurance and 401K etc. And my annual bonus is another $120K or so after taxes and my equity is another $100K or so that vests over time.

My biggest expenses are my two mortgages - my other commitments are tiny, and honestly we have plenty left over. 

My annual bonuses pay for some travel, a nice watch most years and some jewelry for my wife, a few donations, and the rest into savings. If I have to pay an extra thousand towards taxes, it just means that I end up not buying a $20K watch and instead buy a $10K watch instead (or instead of putting in $110K in savings, I put in just $100K).

And btw, most people in my circle make a lot more. My other friends in Wall St, tech, and plenty others make like $2-3M a year easy at mid-career. 

It's honestly unfair and quite wrong."

The TL;DW is that the loser of the election could refuse to concede and instead launch legal battles in attempt to undermine the electors and force the decision to be made in the House of Representatives, in which the states vote (*not* the reps, the states - which there are more red than blue). 

Beyond that, they can abuse their power to invoke militias to intimidate government officials into going along with the coup. 

Jones urges concern citizens to resist such a subversion of democracy through peaceful protest, support of legal groups fighting the coup, and banding together with fellow Americans based on our core values that the people determine who leads.

Why can't we focus less on military projection and more on national security in the form of... a society. As it stands we broke the social contract.

11350,2020-11-09 17:57:55,jr06ob,"By that math PSLF is allowing you to pay just $48,000 on $350K in loans‚ÄîI'd say people in your situation are already (happily and deservedly!) getting a pretty sweet deal as it is."
11351,2020-11-09 17:59:16,jr06ob,"That's true. My wife is only a couple years away from getting her loans forgiven, but like you know, due to income based repayment, her monthly payments aren't too onerous. IBR means most people with a graduate degree will owe more than when they graduated as the IBR payments don't even cover interest. That's certainly the case for me. So to that end, knocking $50K off an ever increasing 6 figure loan would be a relief, but not a problem solver. 

I would be happy with like a 1% interest rate (or zero interest). Then it would be conceivable to actually pay off the loan. But as it stands, my plan is to transition into gov't or teaching eventually and go the PSLF route as well (assuming the program survives)."
11352,2020-11-09 18:09:56,jr06ob,"My husband is a vet (first year working) with almost exactly the same amount of debt as you, and unfortunately he is insistent that PSLF eligible jobs are not worth the pay cut as most are low-paying/ shelter positions and there aren't many to go around. It's good to hear from someone who's having a positive experience in the program, as I know vets are in a sticky situation for forgiveness compared to other ""essential"" fields. If there was a more comprehensive STEM loan forgiveness program it would change the next 30 years of our financial lives."
11353,2020-11-09 19:15:51,jr06ob,"Not everyone has access to PSLF program and that program was even rumored to be ending. We aren‚Äôt all medical and law degree students, you racked up 350K in debt because you decided to go to school for significantly longer so you can get a job that pays significantly more. Most of us out here had the choice of going to school for a 4 year degree to get a job we have an interest in or go to trade school or try and work your way up from a job without educational requirements. 50K is absolutely enormous for some of us so don‚Äôt write the whole thing off because you e been afforded the opportunity to pursue higher levels of education unlike most of us, especially when you are already in a fantastic program where you aren‚Äôt even going to have to pay back most of that debt if you stay employed in the public sector for 10 years."

11355,2020-11-10 02:12:19,jr06ob,"As long as the 10 years/120 monthly income-based repayments as part of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program stays in effect, I'm fine with anything additional they want to do for borrowers.  I'm approximately two years away from finishing my 120 payments and don't want them to do away with that somehow and substitute in a $50,000 cap because that wouldn't be enough given how interest accumulated for the rest of those payments."
11356,2020-11-09 19:37:58,jr06ob,"All debt, as in not just student loan debt but credit cards and such as well?"
11357,2020-11-09 20:03:46,jr06ob,"Yes. But they‚Äôve delegated some authority over student loans to the Education Department. That‚Äôs how under the Trump admin they‚Äôve been able to reduce the amount of forgiveness without going through Congress. 

But that authority can be stretched the other direction too? And while Congress *could* overrule the decisions of the department with legislation, they can also just ignore it and blow raspberries if Republicans complain."
11358,2020-11-09 19:33:21,jr06ob,"This article has sort of changed what I‚Äôve previously heard about Biden‚Äôs loan forgiveness. 

Before, he had said on the campaign trail that he would forgive $10,000 of undergraduate debt, no matter what. I believe he proposed it as covid relief for students. 

This article paints a different picture, saying it‚Äôs attributed to people that do community service. Wonder which it is?"
11359,2020-11-09 19:32:21,jr06ob,"Except loan forgiveness is not reallocating funds. It is simply not collecting future debts and is perfectly allowable under current law, the same law which allowed trump to freeze payments and interest.

Guaranteeing tuition being covered by the gov't will unironically jack up college prices. If you want to lower the price of tuition, eliminate the guarantee from federal loans. Alternatively, the common sense solution is not to end up in a situation where student debt is possible. Those avenues to avoid it already exist:

* Dual enrollment
* CLEP
* AP courses
* Scholarships
* Research stipends
* Saving up
* Going to a cheap public state school (because frankly, you can find lectures from ""elite"" schools on the internet for free)
* Community college
* Military

Unlike medical research, people willingly chose to take the risk from taking out student loans."

If the Republicans hold onto the Senate (which looks like it'll depend on two run-off elections in Georgia), then lots of Biden's budget ideas probably won't move forward.  And even if they do pass that particular policy, there's no guarantee it would happen in year 1, unless they say more about it soon."

Fervent Warren supporter here. She is literally one of the best financial experts of our time.... and Americans hated her for it, remember when everyone was scoffing at progressives wanting M4A and she came out with pages of technical legal and financial details to make it work? Everyone to the right just because M4A has been straw-manned to death but, and here is what killed her chance this round, everyone to the left also. Because it would take time and work. It wasn't instant and wasn't free and wasn't magic. It was a series of steps toward progress to benefit everyone.


Thats kinda of what Biden is trying to sneak in here, instead of offering the end promises and making both ends of the isle dig in deeper, he has taken many of the 'first steps' that progressive cited as needed for change and just offering those. Biden knows he cannot accomplish all that is needed in his time, he is just going to focus on putting out the fires and laying a new foundation. It will be up to all of us to keep pushing for the building of a better America."
11377,2020-11-09 18:10:44,jr06ob,"One of the things that I can't stand is the obsession some in democratic leadership have with means testing things. They did this with the stimulus checks too and all it does is create an us vs them thing and deny benefits to those who are paying the most in in the first place. 

There should be some blanket forgiveness for all, whether that be 10k, 25k, or 50k"
11378,2020-11-09 17:58:06,jr06ob,"Agreed. This whole ""handout"" nonsense really irks me. It's not a handout when the system has utterly failed an entire generation of people, promising them a bright future if they invest in themselves with college.

I went into college not knowing what I wanted to do with my life, but just followed the advice of all adults that surrounded me. I went into engineering, found out I was decently good in the courses, but 4 years through (5-year track for me because I was working to pay bills, and a 16-20 credit term was often more than I could handle), realized I hated it and didn't understand the concepts well enough to make a career from it. So I spiraled into depression, realizing that holy shit. I have debts of \~$40k now and idk what to do. Luckily, I had an amazing girlfriend who pushed me to find an internship, (now wife), and I found a career not utilizing my degree at all. Still paying down the debt.

Don't get me wrong, an education is invaluable and I don't regret college entirely. My point is: 18 year olds are told this is the only path for success in America. They are practically forced by society to take on $25k+ in debt just to find a job. And now we're seeing that it doesn't even guarantee work.

The situation is like ""Hey kid, if you borrow a ton of money over 4-5 years, you will be rewarded with WAY more money, and it'll be easy to pay down what you borrowed. You'll have a house, a car, and all that you want!"" and the reality in many situations is... ""Borrowed money. Am not making enough to pay it all down. My peers say a Master's degree will surely get me over the hump."" It's not a handout if an entire generation was fed a lie. We're just costing the economy money at this point. If I didn't have student loan payments, I could afford car payments.

EDIT: I just want to say, this isn't a story for people to take pity on me or anything of the sort. I'm doing fine. My problem is that our parents, teachers, coaches, etc. all told us to go to college. Even if we have to take out loans, we need an education to succeed. At 17-18 yrs old, I trust what the adults in my life are telling me and have been telling me. If it's one, sure you can brush that aside, but I was being told by literally everyone ""Go to college"". It's ludicrous to expect kids (or new adults?) to ignore this message from all of the adults in their life. ""You could have gone to CC!"" Of course, and now I wish I did for 2 years, but hindsight is 20-20 and nobody gave me that option. Everyone made it apparent that CC was for those who just couldn't make it to a 4-year school, and **of course** I was smart enough to make it to a 4-year school."
11379,2020-11-09 18:26:58,jr06ob,"Yup.  I want to buy a new house, but have about 2 years left on PSLF.  Basically, I am holding off on buying a house (and contributing to the economy) until forgiveness kicks in.  If for some reason forgiveness is denied (hopefully the Biden administration will be better than the Trump administration about granting applications), then I am not buying a house."
11380,2020-11-09 19:39:02,jr06ob,It is better than nothing.  More than I thought would happen with a corporate democrat.
11381,2020-11-09 21:48:58,jr06ob,But aren't most people with student loan debts fairly middle class? Any government spending is going to be a stimulus so surely if you were going to spend a insane amount of money it'd be better to do it on people in the lower class?
11382,2020-11-09 18:40:52,jr06ob,"That **is** in there also, I just didn't want to paste a wall of text in a single post (cause that goes back to the original problem of people not reading!). There are many different fixes for various programs listed, and this is just education! As far as I'm aware these programs are not an either/or affair. So for public service upto $50K forgiven, then 5% of discretionary income over $25K for 20 years. 

>the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program ‚Äì is broken. Biden will create a new, simple program which offers $10,000 of undergraduate or graduate student debt relief for every year of national or community service, up to five years. Individuals working in schools, government, and other non-profit settings will be automatically enrolled in this forgiveness program; up to five years of prior national or community service will also qualify. Additionally, Biden will fix the existing Public Service Loan Forgiveness program by securing passage of the What You Can Do For Your Country Act of 2019. Biden will ensure adjunct professors are eligible for this loan forgiveness, depending on the amount of time devoted to teaching."

11386,2020-11-09 18:38:32,jr06ob,I'd honestly prefer if it was percentage rather than specific amount.
11387,2020-11-09 17:56:45,jr06ob,">right now you get your debt forgiven if you work in public service or nonprofit

IFF you have the right type of loan. I just did the math this morning. In 7 of the 12 years (don't have electronic banking data on that first 5 years at the moment) I've been paying back my student loans, I've paid 127% of my initial balance and have reduced that balance by 36%. I've been in public service jobs for 12 years but didn't have the right loan type for forgiveness programs."
11388,2020-11-09 18:08:07,jr06ob,But that inherently limits the relief to certain career fields and it seems like a big political loser to only provide benefits to those who work in the public sector/nonprofits.
11389,2020-11-09 17:43:12,jr06ob,"But that essentially limits it to $50k, which at this point, is not enough to cover 4 years at a lower cost state school."

I think career path makes a difference. Say you have debt from nursing or teaching school. I think this should be forgiven. Spent over $100k on Eskimo Dance Theory? Nah, pay that off. Maybe a one time forgiveness not to exceed 25% of original loan balance. 

To your point, if you paid off your loans already (I did too) maybe a one time tax credit on your tax returns?"

I'm opposed to debt forgiveness, in my mind it really does set those who made early and extra payments back in the grand scheme.   
  
I am for slashing the interest rate to next to nothing.   
  
Our household has about 30k in loans left, and still would benefit from either situations as well.  
  
Edit* before this goes nuts, I'm talking about providing a path to easier repayment now, and fixing the issue for future students, which a flat 25k forgiveness doesnt do.   
  
Essentially all payments on student loans straight to principle.   
  
Like i said, I still benefit either way, I just think this is a better approach. Fuck it, how about both. I just dont see how forgiveness helps future students 3-5 years from now."

Better jobs. Better and cheaper colleges. I hate this entitled ass attitude that we should pay out what people chose to do, many of whom are graduate degrees and will be just fine in the long run regardless.

People need to stop using economic arguments as proxy for relieving student debt. If people need economic help, regardless of whether or not they went to college, then that should be the argument. Not ""let's help people best positioned to already be better off."

11411,2020-11-09 20:13:44,jr06ob,"The CARES act went to directly benefit a lot more people than those who have college degrees and also student loan debt.

I'll happily welcome student debt relief--it would put a couple hundred bucks/month back in my bank account, but us college-educateds should also recognize that this sort of stimulus looks and feels really lopsided to a lot of people.  I know that there are a lot of people being absolutely screwed by student loans on an individual level, but statistically speaking, we're still doing better off than the 66% of the country that doesn't have a college degree.  Student debt forgiveness *feels* to a lot of those people like more money going to the college-educated liberal elites who are already doing better than they are.

DOE has the power to negotiate debt. An absolute power. So if someone has 100k in debt they will take 20 years to pay off, the DOE can say ""pay 30k up front and it is all good"". Many other businesses do this too. Money now>money later.

All Biden has to do is instruct the DOE to take $1.00 in exchange for all or part of a persons student loan debt. 

And that would all be legal and above board."

I'm not against it, I just always hear people say ""forgive all the debt"" but the idea of forgiving all student loan debt just seems like something that sounds great but isn't really possible.

11428,2020-11-09 18:45:55,jr06ob,">nd that was in 2015"" you realize that the information available now about these loans is not the information people were being taught and given in 2005.

I am aware, as I said, I was near the timeframe you are talking about and can recall those events. That doesn't change seeing such an astronomical number though and going ""this is fine"" without a plan/idea how to manage it.

I can see how that would be punishing an older generation while giving a handout to a new generation as well, that's a very valid point; maybe completely free even at a two year level isn't the answer either then. I sort of see an associates degree basically the equivalent of an extension of a high school diploma these days, just more specialized for a field...hell a bachelors is pretty much a high school diploma lately...that sort of led me to seeing two years of an associate as an extension of highschool. It's kinda useful, but wont get you much further than just a highschool degree either. Most people expect a bachelors at a minimum.

We can't continue to fall behind in global education standards, but I just don't see total government reliance as the answer.  If you take a loan, you should be responsible for it....if education was a problem for ensuring people understood that,  I can see the govt. chiming in and trying to help someone manage it better, but not solving the problem. Its similar to the housing crash."

I didn't even finish college, but it took me a few years to figure out that college was not for me. In that time racked up a smallish (compared to some people in this thread) 40K. 

I've since found a job working FOR that very same university where I was able to find a job as program coordinator that required a degree, but I had enough real world work experience in similar fields that they accepted that as a substitution instead. So I'm one of the only people here at my office that doesn't have a degree. 

If I could get it wiped away, my fiance and I would immediately be able to start make preparations to get a house next year after we're married. As it is right now, it's seriously too hard to even contemplate doing something like that with that amount hanging over my head."

And the number is too low besides. Two parents making 65k each in NYC do not have the same level of disposable income as the same household making 130k a year in northern KY. 

But it is a step in the right direction and it is certainly not reducing spending, its investing money into the education of the country."

Here's how it went for us... we were told to fill out all the FAFSA stuff, apply to the colleges and see where we stand.

My kid got accepted into UC Davis, they came back and told us ""OK, we reviewed your income and with scholarships and financial assistance, we determined you need to take out parental plus loans of $56,000 per year.""

And I'm like ""thanks, but no thanks, sorry kid, not taking out mortgage level debt for school...""

Then he got accepted into Lewis and Clark and they told us ""OK, we reviewed your income and with scholarships and financial assistance, we determined you need to take out parental plus loans of $56,000 per year.""

And I'm like ""If we could afford that, he'd be going to UC Davis.""

Then he got accepted into the University of Oregon Honors college. 3 guesses as to what they told us and the first two don't count...

""OK, we reviewed your income and with scholarships and financial assistance, we determined you need to take out parental plus loans of $56,000 per year.""

And I'm like ""How is it that two in-state schools and one out-of-state school all came back with the same number? No, we aren't doing this.""

So he enrolled as a normal U of O student, had a $20,000 scholarship that paid about 1/2 his tuition ($5,000 per year) and I paid the other half in cash (routing it through my credit card for bonus points, of course).

Not everyone can do that. A lot of parents would see the first result come back and go ""well, if that's what it costs...""

I'm convinced now, more than ever, that the whole FAFSA thing is a scam to milk parents for as much money as they can get out of us and nothing else."

The TEA party knew this.  And they got a candidate all the way to the presidency by building on each and every gain they could.  They were able to stay energized and organized because they never considered any type of gain a failure.  Even the miniscule tax cut they got was heavily celebrated.

I'll use myself as an example. Went to a public school in an urban environment, got accepted into a half-way decent college. Graduated in 2004 with a BS in IT and Telecom degree. Due to financial constraints I was unable to go onto MS, MBA, etc. 

When I entered the work force in 2004, the dot.com era had crashed, businesses were barely hiring, and I had to start at the bottom. Thankfully I was able to move my way up within the company, but when I re-entered the job market in 2016, the only reason I got my current high paying job was because I networked my way through my previous job and folks knew each other. The other candidates all had BS, MS, MBA , etc. and on paper were much more highly qualified.

* Many politicians are corrupt. Straight up, I've heard this my entire life. It's one of those open secrets that US politicians are basically bought and sold by special interests. So, the idea here is that the GOP has used that as the big selling point for ""the government can't be trusted"" and ""the government is ineffectual at giving you what you want"" because it is true on the surface. 
* There are a lot of regulations on the books that seem to make no sense to the casual observer and some are rather dumb (things like dumb classification of what an ""assault weapon"" or a pistol is or regulation on collecting rainwater). So, when folks see silly regulations and laws which are actually fairly rare, it's much easier to buy in on the idea that all regulations are dumb.
* Republicans have done decades of misinformation on how trickle-down economics works, enough to convince folks that don't look too closely of things that, once again, make sense on the surface for the casual observer.

One of the biggest truisms for this line of logic is that it makes sense if you don't know much about what is being told to you (most folks don't have a good understanding of economics or why certain regulations are in place) and don't bother looking into it too much (again, most folks don't do the work necessary to be informed voters), then it's easy as hell to con them.

Robert A. Taft -- the leader of the conservative coalition -- [tolerated Eisenhower as a practical matter:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1952_United_States_presidential_election#Republican_Convention)

>Most historians now believe that Eisenhower's nomination was primarily due to the feeling that he was a ""sure winner"" against the Democrats; most of the delegates were conservatives who would probably have supported Taft if they felt he could have won the general election.

Less than we should have gotten because he unnecesarily compromised with Republicans when Democrats had all the power and no reason to do so.

>great recovery from a recession

Caused by Bill Clinton deregulating the market; not inherently Obama's fault, but the point stands the 2008 market recession was a direct result of Democrats *and* Republicans fucking with our regulations.

>republican racism, republican obstructionism

As for your other two.... I got nothing to offer here besides the fact Democrats had control of the house and senate for two years, and didn't think to pass any number of things that could have protected them from losing it at the end of those two years, or for that matter, being unable to ever pick it up again.

They unnecessarily compromised with Republicans; failed to pass any legislation that would have protected from foreign interference in elections(as was strongly recommended at the time) in 2016... and I could go on.

2016's election result is in part a *direct result* of Democratic incompetence on all fronts. So maybe we shouldn't be too hasty to assume shit would have gotten done *without* Republican obstructionism.

Edit: Yall need to calm down because regardless of how you feel, it definitely overstepped the bounds of the presidency by establishing extra-judicial court systems, the literal definition of a kangaroo court. Obama wasn't a saint or perfect; he just had the good fortune of being book-ended by two unambiguously terrible presidents.

We shouldn't give him a pass just because he was ""on our team"" though. He did a lot of shit that was flagrantly illegal; the SCOTUS on a dozen occasions shutdown his presidential orders for being unconstitutional; he authorized weapon sales to several authoritarian states; and his naive handling of foreign policy was a clusterfuck through most of his first term; and a failure to build a coalition among democrats to build a defense against foreign interference in elections, which was a concern he was warned about back in like 2015; likely handed Trump the win in the first place in 2016.

Maybe you aren't ready to critically examine the reality of the Obama presidency; but Republican obstructionism isn't a good excuse for things he did that were purely in his own purview."

11609,2020-11-09 18:48:55,jr06ob,"So I am still not sure exactly what the forgiveness parameters are.  Your reading seems to be there is a cap of $50k after 5 years, then the remainder is forgiven after 20 years.  If so, that is basically useless for professionals on the current PSLF where there is no cap and all loans are forgiven after 10 years (but pay 10% of their income).

It would also require current PSLF borrowers to opt out, which would lead to disastrous scenarios where borrowers don't opt out, then get screwed when they hit the $50k cap.

Anyway, I'm not sure I agree with your reading of it.  [Edit: I think $50k forgiven after 5 years, then the remainder forgiven after 10 years, with the 5% payment amount makes the most sense.  But I haven't seen anything explicitly stating this.]"

It‚Äôs simply not true. When the housing costs, food costs and transportation costs which are entirely out of our hands have doubled in ten years while salaries have not, no amount of fiscal responsibility will help someone who was living conservatively at the start of their career ten years ago. Their efforts are counterweighted by the rapid rises in COL. There‚Äôs only so much fat to cut out of an already lean budget. There are other situations where people become unexpectedly sick or disabled. Or become victims of domestic and financial violence. Or lose a car to an accident and have to scramble to figure out paying for a new one because part of their frugality and financial security was driving a 99 civic without full coverage and high deductibles because they needed the pay down their student loans. There‚Äôs just too many variables outside our control that influence and sometimes even determine where our income goes to assume that people supporting or needing blanket debt relief are also people without fiscal responsibility."

When do you *stop* paying retail rates for degrees that have -- in the *vast* majority of cases -- absolutely no market value post-college.  At some point you're just printing money and immediately converting it into inflation, and devaluing secondary education entirely.  And then people will need to get some new tertiary education to justify their hiring into a rapidly shrinking workforce. Does the government start paying for that after a while?

Its a very slippery slope that, in reality, would just make things worse. 

The real fix is to stop giving out nearly free student loans, and make students justify the loans the same way a business would have to justify a loan. 

If you want $200k to get your education through PhD in art history, present a business plan for how you're going to recoup that investment. 

The reason there's a generation crushed in student loan debt is because there's a generation that was given loans so easily, it collapsed the market and drove up prices -- just like cheap mortgages bubbles the housing market, etc.  You don't fix a bubble by making it even cheaper."

Because of this, directing DoE to simply write these notes off could be done in a single day. Uncle Sam is the actual holder of those debts, not slme bank, so forgiving them is as simple as choosing to do so. 

As to affording it, the government is not meaningfully dependent on loan payments from beleaguered student borrowers to fund itself. The objections to writing off DoE debt are entirely immaterial, as the result *surge* of economic activity following the writeoff would massively assist businesses and consumers alike. People could suddenly buy cars and homes, pay other debts, take vacations, and spend freely at local businesses.

It is a win-win for everyone. Businesses would see only benefits from loan dismissal as their potential customers now have more free income to spend, and consumers as a whole would broadly benefit for obvious reasons."

11638,2020-11-09 18:17:23,jr06ob,"As someone else pointed out, we just spent $2 Trillion on the cares act, so we are perfectly capable of spending that kind of money without asking for taxes to pay for it. The government doesn't need its citizens to ""pay"" for everything it does.

The government, (both Democrats and Republicans), have been essentially feeding the public a lie for decades, whether or not that's intentional by them, I don't know. The government has the ability to spend money without pushing extra taxes onto its citizens, as long as inflation is kept in check. Inflation is kept in check by taxes. The lie that has been pushed is that the government needs a ""balanced budget"" and we can't have a ""deficit"". It's a load of bullshit. The deficit has been rising for years, we have tens of trillions in ""national debt"", and yet by most metrics, we have a relatively functional economy.

There is a balancing act to be had, but take a look at the 2008 crash, and this most recent economic downturn. The government was able to inject a crap load of money into the economy to keep the wheels spinning, (most of the money going to corporations). The fed is pushing the government to issue more aid, as they don't see any majors markers of significantly increased inflation.

There's no reason to think the government can't just essentially ""wave a wand"" and make the student debt disappear (at least government student loans) - the money itself has been paid out to the colleges already and the vast majority of borrowers are either not making payments or just making the minimum, so there is not much money being paid back to the government from these loans, (which we would assume would be a major issue if the loans actually mattered). If we're talking about paying private student loans as well, then the government would need to pay that out, but for the most part, the government isn't ""paying"" anything here, because it's not a business that has a zero sum balance sheet. It prints it's own money.

All of this being said, I think the government needs a plan in place for free public college tuition before forgiving the loans. Otherwise, we'll just have another generation taking on loans and deal with this again in 15-20 years.

This is simply reassessing how we spend and collect federal taxes to serve the people rather than the wealthy.

For instance, estimates on total tax cuts for the top 20% income-earning households since Bush's admin puts the total cost at about 6 trillion. The top 1% as received over 60% of tax cut benefits in that time period.

After 75k there's diminishing returns. It still improves things, but IMHO it's more about degree at that point. At 75k if managed smartly you could likely afford a sports car. At 750k a year that sports car could be one of most varieties of supercar. But it's still just a matter of degrees separating them.

Alltogether I make maybe $130k a year. I could afford to pay more taxes to help the less fortunate as well. Personally though I'm not waiting on the taxes. Every 2-3 years we like to identify someone who has hit a real tough spot. A few years ago we provided a guy with a house to live in with utilities and internet paid for around a year. He's now a software developer making over $80k a year. Nothing paid back, but great investment. At the start of COVID a girl I worked with when I was a Waiter early in life was in jail over unpaid fines stemming from a babyseat violation 20 years ago. Paid $5000 in back fines to get her out and let her get a fresh start. 

While I welcome higher taxes to help the less fortunate, we also do our best to take direct action. If you are in a position to take actions like that from time to time, I highly recommend it. Changing a life or two is so much more satisfying than having the latest OLED TV. Know that it may end up being a waste/lost cause, but to me at least the humanity in making the effort is worth it.

There are some Americans that just the revenue of a 1% tax increase on them, would be more than a 10% increase on the hundreds of  millions of other citizens of the country.

Our rich are soooo wealthy that just a tiny increase on the top, is way more valuable than a large increase on the middle/bottom."
11749,2020-11-09 22:01:33,jr06ob,"That would raise more revenue for sure, and in the long-term I do agree that you likely need higher taxes across a broader base of taxpayers, to pay for any real expansion of public services.  But I also understand why they wouldn't push for that in the election against Trump, since it would be controversial and there was so much on the line.  Not worth the risk.

It's also worth noting that income inequality is *way* higher in the US compared to Scandinavia - the poor are poorer, but the rich are richer.  So a tax increase on $400k+ would add more revenue in the US than it probably would in Scandinavia."
11750,2020-11-09 21:25:44,jr06ob,"Fyi, there already is a gradual tax increase on income based on brackets. So, those making $80k-100k already do pay more than those making, say $30k.

But I think there are probably other things that could be done instead that I would prefer because they would be beneficial to the economy *and* would statistically help more of the people who need it most.  I understand the point of student debt relief as stimulus, but I have a bit of a philosophical problem with intentionally prioritizing economic relief towards a demographic group that is, *on average*, doing better than the out-group (which does not mean that anyone is doing *well*, but this is all relative).  It's a matter of priority.  My understanding is that the economic effects would probably be the same or better if that stimulus money were to target a group defined by something like unemployment instead of student loan debt.

Like I said, I'll happily take the debt forgiveness if that's what Biden decides to do.  I just think a lot of college-educated people with student debt--especially a lot of very vocal people online--are in a bit of a bubble as to how non-college-educated people might view student loan forgiveness, and why someone might disagree with that particular method as a stimulus.  Statistically, it targets the middle class for stimulus and leaves the overwhelmingly non-college-educated poor feeling even more left behind."
11776,2020-11-09 18:51:24,jr06ob,Well they could increase the amount somewhat to in the low thousands. Getting an infusion of all that money could help tide them over for a while.
11777,2020-11-09 22:14:16,jr06ob,Forgive the debt while making public universities free. You want to go to a private university that costs 50k a year and pursue your bachelor's in lint rolling? Go ahead but that debt is on you and will not be forgiven. We need to give proper incentives for schools to stop charging such insane amounts.  I'm not sure what all of the answers are but that feels like a start to me.
11778,2020-11-09 18:20:53,jr06ob,"That was just the example. It doesn't have to be 30k, it could just be one dollar."

11780,2020-11-09 18:21:20,jr06ob,"Also, the total debt owed has been gifted to the wealthy in the form of tax cuts many times over the last several years. They had the cash to afford to lighten their tax income, surely they could just end those tax cuts and use the regained income to write off the debt."
11781,2020-11-09 18:30:52,jr06ob,"It's quite the opposite. Right now the wealthy pay nowhere close to their fair share of things, get massive gifts in the form of tax breaks and the people left shouldering the load are workers. 

Why is it reasonable to spare the upper class trillions in taxes that they fully deserve to be paying when you have lawyers, doctors etc. going hundreds of thousands of dollars into debt instead? Why not just make wealthy people pay a fair amount of tax and subsidize medical school?"
11782,2020-11-09 21:07:01,jr06ob,The question should really be why the art degree costs 100K in the first place. Other countries churn out low income potential graduates as well but they don't bankrupt them in the process.
11783,2020-11-09 18:44:32,jr06ob,"People need education.

It is absurd to suggest that because you or I ""know"" something to be an absolute truth that everyone should know it.

Shaming or blaming people for not knowing what they don't know is exactly what Conservatives complain about libs doing to them.

It's so arrogant to assume everyone should be just like you or I.  Sad!"
11784,2020-11-09 19:06:38,jr06ob,"That's fair; I'd agree with that as well - if the govt. helps you get to where you are, you need to pay it forward via the marginal tax rate system....and it sucks because you are 100% correct that its obvious why the money isn't there. Its the same way that Warren Buffett can say he pays less in taxes than his senior office employees each year.

That's part of what I liked from the Biden plan was how he was wanting to generate that cash, by closing a few loopholes that led to this disaster. 

How about a thought on reducing what people owe via the interest rate on those loans / backdating paid interest? Or potentially that being an idea moving forward for the country that we dont generate income off of student loans?  Obviously part of the problem is the prices of institutions as well. Federal grants/incentives already exist, so yes a lot of money is already there but it also needs to be sustainable moving forward for years to come, and eliminating that interest could pose a problem until these tax loopholes are rectified.

It does also punish people who did not use those programs to become wealthy, and now are expected to pay more in taxes for others to use it. Doesn't make it right that they pay less in taxes while being in a different bracket, but its also not 100% on them that they can game the system...and I think thats why a lot fight it."

Nobody forced you to go to college. Nobody forced you to go to the college you went to. Nobody stopped you from going to a community college for a few years, then transferring over to a 4 yr school, saving a ton of money. Nobody told you to major in something that no sane person would tell you has any real job opportunities. I can go on, but pretty much ends up being focused on choice. You made a choice. 

Some of what I do support. Slash all interest rates on fed student loans. Some folks are still paying in the 6% range. Reform state schools tuition, no reason a state school should cost 30k for in state students (or anyone).  Book costs, recall needing to drop 1k in a semester, f that. Better financial planning eduction in HS, real career planning, provide resources to id careers that kids may be more interested in that require trade school.  Probably more, you get the idea."

I think this would be the easiest solution to get bipartisan support on, and people really underestimate how beneficial it would be. 

On a $50k loan (assuming a 5% interest rate), it would reduce the monthly payment by over $100 and save you $10k over the term of the loan.

I agree it sucks for people who already paid out to an extent but that's cutting the nose to spite the face at that point. There is a material benefit to reducing debt burdens immediately and going forward, retroactively there's not a lot to be done beyond a tax credit or something similar."

Leave and find a new group. Your partner isn't your soulmate? Hit up one of the dozen dating apps and try again.

It goes the other way too, information makes us aware of how badly some groups in our country have it and can help us empathize more, we have the choice to become more informed about *anything* which is so incredible. The fact that we have almost all the information of the world at our fingertips is something I lack words to describe.

Not to mention - who decides how much we are going to give each individual?  If you want to go pursue your passion in higher education at Harvard, and I want to pursue mine at my local state university, and someone else doesn't want to at all......why should taxpayers spend a bunch of money on me and then twice as much as that on you?

On top of that, it also has the ballot measures as well as a plethora of arguments for and against as well platforms to get more info.

But it‚Äôs not giving people free college tuition *just* because they want to go to college, it‚Äôs giving them free college tuition because we want an educated workforce who aren‚Äôt massively in debt."
12049,2020-11-12 18:32:06,jr06ob,"Well if the money are invested in us companies, the money is already in use in the US. The billionaires don't have all the money in cash. So taxing that money must necessarily mean closing large corporations, no?

I think the services we receive are alright, however expensive. The system is quite bureaucratic. 
I think it is also fair to take into account that Danes are much healthier than Americans on average. So the healthcare cost will always be lower I would think.

Another factor to consider is that the high income taxes drive up gross wages. As a result, manufacturing jobs are becoming an endangered species."

12051,2020-11-12 19:34:33,jr06ob,"If you tax illiquid assets of private persons who are billionaires, the cashflow of major corporations would suffer greatly. No matter the tax level basically. The minute a company runs out of cash it is bankrupt basically. They can still have lots of assets, but they will still be bankrupt. 

My job includes advising corporations on whether they should offshore their manufacturing. And you are right. Offshoring is profitable because of the huge difference in wages. When doing business cases for offshoring manufacturing, it almost doesn't make sense to include Chinese wages as a driver because they are so cheap.

That said, manufacturing will always be a job somewhere. Stuff always have to be made. Even fully automated factories have loads of personel for maintenance and all those small tasks that aren't automated like shipping, and smaller processes.

 I would argue that automation would actually bring manufacturing jobs back to the west."

12053,2020-11-12 19:55:20,jr06ob,"Corporate tax:
Well as a citizen that wouldn't benefit you either, I'd say. Amazon, Walmart and apple going bankrupt would impact many American lives I would imagine. Of course in terms of employment, but Americans also buy a lot of products from those companies.

Manufacturing:
Oh you are right about that. Transport will die as an industry with automated vehicles. Maybe not maintenance of the machines alone, but the lower cost of transport would drive up demand for transport. That means more vehicles on the road. So more jobs in vehicle manufacturing. It also means more jobs in loading and unloading trucks. And so on. Looking at what machinery and automation has done to agriculture, I think the jobs will just move to other industries serving the automated industri. But naturally that is just my take on it. I might be wrong."

12057,2020-11-09 17:07:52,jr053k,That‚Äôs crazy. We‚Äôve had boomer presidents for almost 30 years now. Similar to the period from the 1960s-1980s when we only had presidents born in the 1910s with the exception of Carter
12058,2020-11-09 16:40:39,jr053k,I want a Gen x president
12059,2020-11-09 16:25:54,jr053k,I wonder how a silent generation president will work out. But it won‚Äôt be too much of a difference since it‚Äôs only a few years away from boomers.
12060,2020-11-09 17:30:57,jr053k,"Personally I would say that George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter are Silent Gen, Biden is an early boomer,  and Obama is early X/Gen Jones, but going by pew‚Äôs ranges you‚Äôd be correct"
12061,2020-11-10 20:53:46,jr053k,Looks like we get a Silent Generation president finally going by the rule that 1946 is the start of baby boomers.
12062,2020-11-09 21:55:28,jr053k,"Honestly I think this is a bad sign for Gen X. Not saying we won‚Äôt have one, but it is very possible we won‚Äôt.

You can see that silent gen got skipped almost entirely, except for joe Biden this year. If he lost, we would never have had a silent president (doubt we would have gotten one in 2024)

The silent generation was just dwarfed by the size and power of the greatest gen and boomers. Nothing wrong with them, but the just sheer size of the other two gens really means they got eclipsed 

I thibk that‚Äôs really likely for X, excluding those late boomers who are honorary Xers. Comparatively, there‚Äôs just so few of them, and boomers and millennials tend to dominate everything

The logic is that there are so many boomers, and they maintain power for so long. By the time they start letting go, millennials are here. That‚Äôs basically what my gen x parents have shared to me about their experiences in the working world. A lot of baby boomers bosses for a long time, followed by millennials starting to rise up.

Idk just food for thought 

If joe Biden wins 2024, I think a millennial president in 2028 is very likely. If he loses or chooses not to run, I think we could still see a boomer, but a gen x or y president is possible."
12063,2020-11-09 18:51:40,jr053k,"Biden doesn't look like a very promising president figure. Not that trump was one, he's a complete asshole too, but biden just doesn't seem very strong, from a non-american person's perspective. Maybe Kamala will take up or something idk."
12064,2020-11-09 19:03:06,jr053k,How are George HW Bush and Jimmy Carter silent gen? lol
12065,2020-11-09 22:34:06,jr053k,"Not to mention that they are one of the smallest generations ever. I can see having maybe one more boomer president and then a millennial. I think whoever comes next is going to young, like Obama."
12066,2020-11-09 22:43:33,jr053k,Very true. Gen Xers were called baby busters at first. There‚Äôs just so few of them to make an impact.
12067,2020-11-09 22:33:58,jr053k,"Yeah I feel like Joe Biden is too ""soft"", I feel like he will be pushed around but at the same time we underestimated him before the election. I have faith in our new president."
12068,2020-11-09 20:18:03,jr053k,"Culturally I believe they are, at least in my global theory. But historically they were of age to fight in World War 2, so commonly that would make them G.I. Gen"
12069,2020-11-10 20:52:51,jr053k,"He is going by the two-decade rule, which I also go by when I am not on this sub. Basically, 1920-1939 would be silent generation by that rule. Barack Hussein Obama would be early Gen X/Gen Jones, Joseph Biden would be an early baby boomer (WWII cusp), and George H.W Bush senior and Jimmy Carter would be SIlent Generaiton."
12070,2020-11-09 23:50:24,jr053k,"yep. The sheer unprecedented size of the boomer generation is really what made them so unique. They were just so large compared to previous generations, that they really shook everything up everytime they moved to a new stage of life, if that makes sense.

They are huge. In 2019, when baby boomers were 55-73, they were still the second biggest generation. That‚Äôs AFTER their peak, and after they‚Äôve had decades to die off. Poor Gen X is tiny compared to them lol. (Of course it‚Äôs not as impressive now because millennials are even larger, but at the time, baby boomers were uniquely large)

Gen X just got stuck in the middle. It was a combo of low birth rates and small parent population. Millennial birth rates raised for a few years (general trend was still down) but there were also a lot of boomers to have a lot of kids. Hence the baby bust in the middle lol.

(We‚Äôre probably never going to have as big of a generation again. Gen Z is already smaller than Y and boomers lol)"
12071,2020-11-10 00:54:38,jr053k,"not necessarily.. maybe late 90s but for 2000s and up that‚Äôs completely **big!** how I know? Throughout my Middle School and High School Years the hallways were massively packed. although I knew, my way around the school, when it came to special events like Pep Rally the seats were overcrowded and fights would happen."
12072,2020-11-10 01:27:32,jr053k,"Lmao i don‚Äôt thibk the number of people in yuri school is an accurate representation of the population of everyone in the country born in the late 90s through early 2010s...

Gen Z is small lol. There‚Äôs like 67 million people born between 97 and 12 in the US. There‚Äôs 65 million Xers and 72 million millennials.

Looking at birth rates make it pretty clear. Downward trend. My year, 2004, was about 14 per 1000 ppl.  It was a little under 15 in 1995. 1994 was just over 15. 10 years the other way, it‚Äôs about 12 and half.

Yep... :/ the birth rate is decreasing a lot.

Like I said above, there are way more millennials than Gen Z."

I think that this series is part of the reason why it was so popular to type FG around that time the videos were released. It would be interesting to open up a discussion about it.

12138,2020-11-09 16:20:01,jr00gw,"I don't understand how there can be so much discussion such a simple issue. Are people really so locked into their bubble, their echo chamber, that they do not understand that there is a whole world out there, with millions of people with other problems, other issues, other dreams, other hopes, other ambitions, other fears, and other experiences?

God, I wish Yanks could learn more in school about what goes on outside of that little corner of the world, and learn about social-democratic societies in northern Europe, of historical fascist regimes in Germany, Italy and Spain, of communism in the Soviet Union, of Christian Democracy in Germany, of gay right-wing leaders in the Netherlands, and so much more. All this ridiculous misinformation about socialism or fascism or ""dem comin' ta take our freedom!"" is just childish at this point."

12142,2020-11-09 16:06:49,jr00gw,"Many people voted for Trump because they believe that they work hard and pay their own way and that Biden and the Democrats will give money and benefits to people who are not citizens, deserving, or contributing. They see health insurance as a working benefit, not a basic guaranteed right. 

That is not how I feel. I feel that government should tax billionaire wealth. Immigration should be available (not limited or lottery). Everyone should have health insurance, not just the wealthy or employed. Homelessness isn‚Äôt a decision or an accident. It is the direct result of limited economic mobility. Someone who cannot earn enough to provide for their family doesn‚Äôt end up homeless because they are lazy."

12144,2020-11-09 16:23:50,jr00gw,"Here's the thing - Trump lost. Fair and square. People want to come up with conspiracy theories on how that is not possible. Frankly, I don't give a fuck. If you want to believe that the Dems rigged this, then go take your 45th President and carve a block of land for yourselves and go circle jerk yourselves.

If Trump won, the majority of Biden supporters would be disappointed. But we would've accepted it.. like the majority of us did the first time around. Don't send me dms on that one liberal bitch shown sobbing on camera that Hilary lost.. Lol. A bunch of feminists holding a vigil in front of town hall does not equate to the masses agreeing with what they are doing. And some still would hold up a bullhorn and spew their far left rhetoric. Happens on both sides, it is what it is.

 But there are FAR too many of you Republicans going absolutely berserk over the outcome. Like, Calm. The. Fuck. Down. It's just four years remember you saying that to us? And then you called us cry babies, snowflakes, and dumbocrats. Any of this ring a bell?

So, go make your # Not My President memes and go stand in front of government buildings with your AR47's and your fuckboy facial expressions. But for the love of everything gay ..   ..  .. get this out of your system so we can all move the fuck on and get back to why won't my straight roommate fuck me posts and I-should-be-asking-a-doctor, not-a-bunch-of-internet-strangers posts.

12146,2020-11-09 20:27:02,jr00gw,Exactly!!
12147,2020-11-09 17:23:30,jr004z,"NTB. I am political and admittedly loathe 45 and his idiocy. 

You didn‚Äôt point out the kids separated from their parents and harmed by him. You didn‚Äôt point out the racist behaviour exacerbated by him. You didn‚Äôt explain the women‚Äôs lives tortured by him. You didn‚Äôt even bring up the 240,000 people killed by him not listening to science. 

All you did was comfort her and tell her Biden will not harm LGBTQ+ people. You told the truth and comforted a child. Her parents can decide to undo that but you comforted a child who was hurting and did not lie."
12148,2020-11-10 15:41:22,jr004z,"I didn't think there was any case where I would say it is OK to discuss politics with a child but you did the right thing. 

Actually, you were not talking politics. You were correcting a child who believed a fictional and frankly deranged story about an impending gay holocaust in the US. That is something that has to be corrected so that the child is not terrified."
12149,2020-11-09 17:52:07,jr004z,NTB. You corrected a mistaken idea that was causing her distress. It doesn't matter where that (frankly bizarre) idea came from. A little kid was scared and crying; comforting them with facts was the right thing to do.
12150,2020-11-10 05:49:45,jr004z,NTB although you probably should have done some investigation on what exactly she's been told. But no little kid should be scared that their friends are going to die because of a politician when it isnt true.
12151,2020-11-11 10:09:13,jr004z,NTB. The kids parents had brainwashed her to believe something that wasn‚Äôt true. You simply told her the truth.
12152,2020-11-12 19:10:24,jr004z,"YTBF. You were talking politics to the little kid because you didn't like what she said. There's a hard political divide in the country, and I don't think people that aren't close family should push politics on someone else's kid. 

""Telling Lies or The Truth"" seems to be on a sliding scale lately, depending on who is speaking. Whether from family, to school, to the media, there is an agenda behind what people believe, and clearly there is a ton of anti-\_\_\_ talk on all sides.

People have been surprised when I tell them to stop preaching politics I don't agree with to my family's children. A few were insulted too. The look of shock and disgust on their faces was obvious when I said I should have the exact same right to preach another candidate's message to their kids. Please don't do this."
12153,2020-11-10 22:29:10,jr004z,"This. It wasn‚Äôt a political discussion. It was correcting some thing a child had heard and possibly even completely misunderstood that frightened her. What were you supposed to do, let the poor child be terrified over something that‚Äôs completely false?  

I would add that it is important to remember something a fifth grade teacher once told me (that‚Äôs of children who are about 10 or 11 years old for foreigners): at that age they are usually truthful but frequently inaccurate. That‚Äôs why you shouldn‚Äôt be discussing politics in front of small children. They often misconstrue things and it‚Äôs possible she heard something totally different than what she thought she heard. I‚Äôm not saying that people are above lying to garner support for their favorite candidates, but children do confuse things sometimes, especially when it‚Äôs topics they don‚Äôt understand very well because they‚Äôre hearing adults talk in adult language in a context they don‚Äôt have to interpret it. There‚Äôs a reason when in education we talk to children about topics like this, we emphasize that you must do it in an age-appropriate way so that they understand correctly. It sounds as if you did a very good job of doing that. 

DEATH puts you at the top of the cat adoption list"
12154,2020-11-12 19:33:25,jr004z,"i understand where you‚Äôre coming from, but i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair either that this poor girl has to be terrified of a mass genocide because her lunatic parents fed her lies to make her hate the president-elect."
12155,2020-11-22 03:20:14,jr004z,"You‚Äôre an ass. This child was clearly troubled and the OP simply wanted to calm her down, which is absolutely the right thing to do. But go ahead and make this about politics. You clearly have never dealt with children. I hope you don‚Äôt breed."
12156,2020-11-22 03:22:07,jr004z,"The person you‚Äôre responding to is an opinionated, conspiracy touting trump cultist. Not worth your time."
12157,2020-11-22 03:46:05,jr004z,"Thanks for the polite reply OP. I also don't think it's fair to fill a kid's head with lies, and I appreciate what you were looking to do, I just think it could have been done another way without stepping on people's toes.

The last few presidents have been shit-shows regarding what kinds of things people said/believed about them, and this kind of thing is helping continue that route. Maybe you could talk to the parents instead?"
12158,2020-11-22 03:42:01,jr004z,"Sure, the kid was upset, so some calming down is fine. It's kind of expected from family. In case you didn't read the OP's thread, this IS about politics. It's the point of the story. I didn't ""turn"" it that way. Reading comprehension is important.

Both trump and biden campaigns and speeches are being misquoted by mobs of people, spreading outright lies about all kinds of things, and it's kind of gross that parents are shoving so much BS into the heads of little kids about either side, especially when the kid doesn't know any better. Adults can research things - a little kid isn't likely to do that so well.

What I was saying is that it's one thing to fill your own kid's mind with political crap, but please don't intrude and force your ideas onto other people's kids. If someone tries to preach politics (or any other potentially controversial topic) to my kid, then I will see that as an invitation to do the same to their kids. It's only fair."
12159,2020-11-22 03:32:29,jr004z,"HAHA, wow. I hope you didn't hurt your shoulder on that long reach. Sure, I'm opinionated - so what? Pretty much every comment here, is someone voicing their opinion. It's part of what Reddit is for...

Conspiracy touting trump cultist? smh. Not quite QH, not quite. That's silly."

Oaks' recent General Conference talk, which I will quote from briefly here (with thanks to Kurpulis for the idea) and encourage you to review the whole thing:

""In a democratic government we will always have differences over proposed candidates and policies. However, as followers of Christ we must forgo the anger and hatred with which political choices are debated or denounced in many settings.""

""...This does not mean that we agree with all that is done with the force of law. It means that we obey the current law and use peaceful means to change it. **It also means that we peacefully accept the results of elections.** We will not participate in the violence threatened by those disappointed with the outcome. **In a democratic society we always have the opportunity and the duty to persist peacefully until the next election.**""

I‚Äôm seeing lots of comments that are trying to apply our religion to support one side of a political argument. Let‚Äôs do better than that. Both Biden and Trump make their decisions based on the best ideas of men, and both are flawed.

We have something much, much better: a living prophet who listens to God and leads us. We should spend more energy trying to follow what he says and less energy worrying about defending our political party or candidate."

That's proof Trump should be prosecuted for sexual assault, right? We can just assume that there wouldn't be so many allegations if it didn't happen."
12448,2020-12-30 16:15:49,kn4qwy,"Ahh but there were already many investigations into these claims and here are some of the results. Now I expect the same from you for the potential fraud instances, k!?

>Jessica Leeds, the women who accused Trump of groping her on a plane in the 80's had inconsistencies in her story regarding the armrests on the plane, which were central to her whole story, and was likely in a dispute with Trump over trees on one of his properties in 2007 given she has the same name and would have been the same age as the woman in that dispute.

>Rachel Crooks accused Trump of sexual assault because he shook her hand for too long and greeted her with a double kiss on the cheek, something Trump does a lot, sometimes even with men. Clearly degeneracy.

>Jessica Drake, a porn star and porn director, says Trump kissed 2 women in front of her without asking, doesn't specify where but probably standard Trump cheek kisses since it was apparently in front of a golf tournaments worth of people. She then claims Trump offered her 10,000 dollars to go to dinner with him. The evidence for this? A photograph of the two together at the golf tournament. Gloria Allred is this one's attorney btw.

>Jill Harth claimed that Trump tried to grope her under the table at dinner and then later cornered her in his daughters bedroom and groped her again. Oh and also when this accusation was made Jill Harth and her husband were in a law suit against Donald Trump for 125 million dollars. No motive to lie at all.

>According to Cathy Heller Trump forcibly kissed her in front of an entire mothers day brunch at Mar-A-Lago in 1997. Does that sound believable? Really? But an unidentified relative and a friend say it happened, so hang him I guess.

>Melinda McGillivray says Trump groped her in front of Melania, photographer and friend of McGillivray Ken Davidoff and the only person looking at her... Ray Charles, who is famously blind. Convenient. She also says she encountered Trump as she was leaving a bathroom in 2001 and he made small talk. Lock him up.

There's also the women who were being paid by Lisa Bloom for allegations, but lets not mention those.
9 accusers haven't spoken to the media since the 2016 election as far as I know, which means that they lost interest after Trump won, gee I wonder why, you would think if the President had sexually assaulted you, you would stick with the story all the way till the end and capitalize on the fact that 45% of the country on any given day hates Trumps fucking guts.
I could go on, but it took me about 20 minutes to re-research all these claims and I think you get the point. It also took an ounce of common sense. Look into it for yourself. Aren't October surprises fun? That's when most of these allegations are from, weeks before election day. Nothing suspicious at all."
12449,2020-12-30 16:09:34,kn4qwy,Fucking pathetic fail here.

12451,2020-12-30 16:33:06,kn4qwy,">There's also the women who were being paid by Lisa Bloom for allegations, but lets not mention those.

Oh good, since we agree that allegations that are the result of under-the-table payments should be discounted, then it's important to note that [Republican leaders have literally been attempting to bribe the public for voter fraud stories](https://www.statesman.com/story/news/state/2020/11/10/dan-patrick-solicits-info-on-voter-fraud-by-dangling-dollars/114839960/).

>you would think if the President had sexually assaulted you, you would stick with the story all the way till the end and capitalize on the fact that 45% of the country on any given day hates Trumps fucking guts

Maybe it's that [Trumpies tend to stalk and give death threats to those that dare oppose him?](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/09/trump-voter-fraud-threats-violence-militia) Just a guess. News flash: most people would rather their families be safe than inflict a win on a political figure whose cult of personality is the strongest ever seen in American history.

You know, because those people actually have families. If you had one you actually gave a shit about, you'd understand that motivation.

It's a bit comical that you're pushing back against the quality of these claims. I know that they're low quality. The problem for you is that they have precisely the same evidentiary value as affidavits or testimony from known partisans - [or ex-strippers fresh off probation](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9015555/I-WASNT-drunk-Rudy-told-shush-says-star-witness-Trumps-voter-fraud-claim.html) - claiming voter fraud."
12452,2020-12-30 16:11:34,kn4qwy,"Oh no, please: why is it that affidavits from women stating Trump assaulted them are laughable uncorroborated hearsay that should be inadmissible in court, but affidavits from partisan election observers are gold standard evidence that is worthy of ending democracy in America?"
12453,2020-12-30 16:14:53,kn4qwy,"lol because uncorroborated hearsay is almost never admissible in court. 

You only rely on uncorroborated hearsay when you're desperate and have no other evidence to prove your points.

The quality of the evidence of voter fraud is precisely the same as the quality of the evidence of Trump being a sexual predator."

I even had 4 direct message in Facebook Messenger from strangers telling me that I should kill myself, that I'm a traitor to America. One of them even went to my wifes FB account and were saying things trying to dox me (all the info they got was public).

I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is that seemingly unbelievable things (65k for food) can be reasonable and that seemingly reasonable people (they don‚Äôt hand out military academy enrollments and intelligence jobs to anyone) can believe unbelievable things.

12556,2020-12-30 17:40:32,kn3hs6,"Crazy story... I'm sorry to hear it.   


I think that Americans in general are just pre-disposed to crazy. I mean, think about it... the grand majority of adults, actual grown ups still believe that there are angels, humans with wings, flying around in the sky above us... and they didn't stop that child rape over there, but they did make sure Karen got her new Keurig for Christmas (#blessed).   


If you believe something like that... is it that far of a stretch to think that an alien race of lizards is trying to control the population of Earth and magically draining the lifeforce from children?  


Our schools teach our kids right from the get-go... believe what we say. If you find another way to do that problem, tough- follow my instruction- it doesn't count. Don't question authority. Small towns like I live in here in TX still have ancient rules around things like the dress code, and they even push Christianity in class knowing there won't be repercussions. It's a shit show.  


I'm not sure why anyone, anyone at all is surprised that while sure- Americans are technically quite smart and capable... from a social standpoint, and critical thinking standpoint... it's fucking scary. We all work, right? Just think about where you work... picture your leaders. Ask yourself, are they even fucking qualified? I know they're not where I work... and I work for a huge company with name recognition. Average people are painful to endure... Honestly. Why do we believe that our leaders are anything more than average? And knowing that... why do we think the population won't suffer for it?"
12557,2020-12-30 18:08:36,kn3hs6,"This is heartbreaking to read.  A tragedy unfolding.  It really sounds as though her unresolved childhood trauma with her alcoholic dismissive mother has come to the surface in the form of this QAnon addiction.  

As a therapist, I‚Äôve been witnessing what I speculate is a direct link between the wounded inner child parts of individuals who have experienced sexual, physical or emotional abuse in their formative years and this absorption/compulsion toward the QAnon type myth of the children held underground in states of constant suffering by sinister authority/adult figures.  It plugs into the dark unconscious realms of the psyche where the exiled and abandoned inner children wallow in states of constant pain as though the abuse is forever current. 

I think these inner unresolved wounded parts get projected outward onto these imaginary children who are on the cusp of being rescued by a godly figure and all the darkness in the world will be magically lifted. So much easier and rewarding than to turn inward and address the pain with no real trust that it can ever be resolved and no magic forces at hand.  

It may be helpful to know that your beloved partner, who is indeed suffering from a sickness akin to what you have suffered with alcohol, still retains her authentic self underneath these highly activated personality parts that have seized the reins of late.  Cult scholars have found that the authentic self can never really be destroyed no matter the intensity of the cult programming.  And this is the key to rescuing our loved ones who are indoctrinated. Authentic love reaching to the authentic self always trumps the cult personality that overlies it eventually. Unfortunately trying to counter them via reason/facts/logic often adds fuel to the fire of their cult persona and ironically leads to them doubling down on their position. Whereas reaching out to their authentic self, and their pre cult self can be much more effective. 

Oh, but the damage that can happen to every aspect of the Qultists‚Äô life while indoctrinated is really awful and we do need to protect ourselves from that damage.  Just as it‚Äôs damaging to live with an alcoholic, it‚Äôs damaging and dangerous to live with someone in the throes of a destructive cult addiction.  

I truly hope your ‚ÄòSara‚Äô moves through this nightmare quickly and can begin to address her inner held trauma so it doesn‚Äôt manifest this way again."
12558,2020-12-30 16:20:32,kn3hs6,"The thing with cults is that they are very good at connecting with intelligent people with crap childhoods. They know exactly how to exploit the emotional vulnerabilities and shape their language to do so.

You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders, and I'm very glad you recognize the dangers of this conspiracy addiction cult. I'm so sorry your loved one was lost to it. I, like you, hope that Sara finds her way back out. In the meantime, this community offers tremendous support for your grief."

There are many who feel that Q-Folk are not bright - or educated. This is not correct. Sometimes this is true, but many are really smart and have several degrees.  

She has been sucked into a world where she feels powerful, and special - and unfortunately, as far as I can tell, without personal desire to escape, and careful de-programming and support, she is likely to be there for a while. 

I am also deeply in love with a person who is no longer present. It is heartbreaking every day. I hope that I will be able to heal from the Q-Disappearence of my soulmate from our relationship. It seems dramatic, but it's the truth. I feel that I enabled his insane behaviour accidentally, but after he told my children that the pandemic was a hoax organised by the global government so they could vaccinate us and change our DNA he just had to leave. I threw him out the next day, he hasn't lived with us since. 

You and I will have to go through the stages of grief, and support our children through it too. I have no real advice, apart from to say you are NOT alone, and you do not need to drink. You've got this.

12563,2020-12-30 16:25:34,kn3hs6,Thank you for sharing üíú
12564,2020-12-30 17:06:17,kn3hs6,"I agree with and understand your comparison between cults and addiction, and I think it's an important connection to make.  Understanding the lessons of AA and seeing the intractability of addiction if the person won't (usually feels like can't) stop is essential to understanding the obstinance of the q's.   

In both cases, as you allude, the addiction (whether to drugs, alcohol, cults) is almost always a response to something deeper; something empty and in need at the very core of one's psyche. The drug or the cultish belief provides a balm, or what seems like a balm, and assuages the pain. It becomes a blanket and a shield.  

Here's where it gets tricky.  One wants to remove the blanket or shield because that's what's presenting as the problem on the surface.  But that blanket/shield is what's covering the wound that required the blanket/shield to begin with.  The addict/cultist will fight anyone who tries to remove the thing that is, seemingly, ameliorating the pain. Instead of focusing on the drink/drug/crazy thinking, one needs to find the pain beneath and address that.  This is not all that revelatory but it's essential.  Of course the super tricky part is that usually, in order to address the wound(s) within, the person needs to relinquish their hold of the blanket/shield, which is often the last thing they are willing to do.  That's why AA considers hitting some kind of a bottom a catalyst for possible change.  Unfortunately, most people need to suffer greatly before even being willing to try putting down their blanket/shield.  

And so, like watching a ship sink, there is very little that can be done until the person chooses to grab for a lifeboat.  And when they do, if they do, only then do they have a chance to get back to land.  And if this happens, in my experience, it's important not to demonize the blanket/shield, but to merely show them, through example and patience, that the land is habitable and can be firm under their feet.  A safe place where finally one can begin addressing the real hole within that caused the need for the drug/idea.

And you quoted Dave, which just always makes me happy.  I'm sorry for your situation friend, but I think you know the situation better than most and that means there is hope."
12565,2020-12-30 17:22:22,kn3hs6,"I've read many stories here on this site and yours truly drives home how this insanity isn't just for gullible hillbillies in the sticks who are ripe rubes for the picking by ruthless con people selling snake oil.  You equating this with alcohol addiction underscores the true evil of Q.   

Conspiracy theorists have found through the internet a ""bug"" in the software of people's minds which allows the disinformation malware to enter and take over, overwriting the victim's reasoning skills, logic and common sense.  It uses emotion to implant an alternate reality straight out of a science fiction novel.  

And the most painful part of all is exactly what you realized.  Like a drug/alcohol addiction this isn't something that can be wiped away by loved ones trying to get through to the victim using the logic and evidence from reality to debunk the crazyland fantasies that are now embedded.  Like a computer virus, it sets up roadblocks that prevent an anti-virus from removing it.  In this case that roadblock is a new belief that ALL data and facts that come from outside the cult are ""fake"".

I can't imagine the pain of losing someone to this cult/addiction.  The sense of helplessness watching a loved one change into a brainwashed stranger who won't ""unplug"" from the addiction, needing the rush of emotions it feeds into it's followers with conspiracy theories of a world on fire, a world coming to an end of which they are ""woke"" to knowledge few others have.  It doesn't matter that none of the predictions ever come true.  Their mind is trained to make up new excuses each time and then wait excitedly for the next prediction/fix.

My heart goes out to you, and to everyone else who has lost loved ones to this cult."
12566,2020-12-30 16:53:13,kn3hs6,"You did the right thing. Your sobriety is the most important thing. I agree that qanon seems to take on the appearance of addiction. Maybe it is the adrenaline rush of knowing something or being part of a conspiracy that causes the addictive like behaviors but I'd guess people with depression , which I imagine is huge right now due to covid, fall down this rabbit hole a lot. I'd suggest psychological help for your gf. Good luck op."
12567,2020-12-30 18:43:52,kn3hs6,That's too bad. The part that always irritates me the most is the slactivism appeal of Q. There really are children being trafficked. I know some of them by name. You don't help them by watching lizard people videos.
12568,2020-12-30 20:18:32,kn3hs6,"About easy solutions for complex situations I love this quote from a guy I have never heard of: 

For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong."
12569,2020-12-30 23:13:17,kn3hs6,"I'm so sorry. If theres any hope, I can tell you i dont think she'll be able to keep this up for long. I spent about 3 years obsessing about conspiracy theories and eventually jumped on the Q train when it first appeared on 4chan. It takes an absurd amount of mental energy to keep up with the information overload that is Qanon.

I noticed much later I operated in cycles, I'd get depressed because everything was ""hopeless"". The only way to get relief from that hopelessness is get another fix. You're completely right that's a sickness and an addiction. There was never any amount of logic that swayed me back into sanity, I finally just gave up, burnt out, and thought ""theres nothing I can do and its hurtful to people to be exposed to the ""truth"" because it would make them feel just as helpless as I was, so I had to give it up.

Once it was out of my system, things became much clearer, I could see the way I sounded to people again, i understood the toll it took on my personality and social life... it was almost overwhelming to think I could fall victim to something so fucking *stupid*. I wish there was something else I could tell you, some bit of advice, but I really dont think theres anything you could have done or could do. 

This is a deep, internal struggle of hers to *trust* in anything. It may seem weird she puts her trust in the absolute fringes of society, but as you say, it fills some kind of void in her life, maybe it's the drama, certainly it's the fear. Once I quit listening to the bullshit, it took me about a year to reconcile everything with myself. I was kicking myself the whole time. It makes perfect sense to me that abused people are the most likely to fall in line with this bullshit, because abused people tend to trust the least in anything everybody else can, like that our government doesnt want to commit a global American holocaust.

If you're not willing to give up on this ""ghost"" just yet, I'd say the only advice you can offer is to give up because theres nothing she can do. Nothing else needs to be said. Whether the bullshit was true or not, she's useless behaving as she is, and especially useless to herself"
12570,2020-12-31 03:54:53,kn3hs6,"I have to start off saying that the weird pseudo intellectual thing you did first describing Sara was very off putting.

I‚Äôm sorry someone you loved fell victim to Qanon and that isn‚Äôt because she is smart or because she is stupid. It‚Äôs propaganda designed to specific a large group of voters, and it worked."

12572,2020-12-30 16:20:07,kn3hs6,This is sad - hope you both find better days
12573,2020-12-30 16:23:02,kn3hs6,I'm sorry that you had to go through this. It's a good thing you recognized what was going on. I am blown away by the number of smart people who fall for this QAnon crap.
12574,2020-12-30 16:33:19,kn3hs6,"That‚Äôs heartbreaking, I‚Äôm so sorry. I‚Äôm just waiting ( and hoping ) that one day these people will wake up. It has to happen at some point, right??"
12575,2020-12-30 17:18:10,kn3hs6,Damn
12576,2020-12-30 18:05:38,kn3hs6,"""Qanon is an addiction. It fills the void in people lives, gives them an easy explanation for complex problems, and gives them someone else to blame. It does for them the same thing booze did for me.""

That's something people need to hear. I view Qultists as victims. They're not necessarily bad people, but that doesn't make them immune to bad ideas."
12577,2020-12-30 18:18:09,kn3hs6,"I am so sorry to hear this. It‚Äôs mind-boggling. I know one of my brothers is being an anti-masker. He‚Äôs also in recovery and his anti-mask statements makes me worry about his sobriety. He‚Äôs susceptible to things. He‚Äôs such an addict, but his addiction has been cross fit for years now (he even went to Masters world championship). I‚Äôm worried."

12579,2020-12-30 19:23:50,kn3hs6,Why get an education when you can just watch YouTube videos?
12580,2020-12-30 20:02:10,kn3hs6,"Your girlfriend has been indoctrinated with propaganda.  It makes sense that she would fall prey to something like this as it probably makes her feel closer to her mom.  I‚Äôm really sad for both of you.  As an alcoholic in recovery you know how damaging past traumas can be if you don‚Äôt deal with them.  This is your girlfriend‚Äôs drug of choice.  Huge kudos to you for recognizing that the emotional pain from dealing with this could cause you to relapse.  I was sober for 13 years before I relapsed the first time, then 4 years and now 17 years.  Both times I relapsed were after the loss of a relationship and both took me completely by surprise.  I never planned or thought about it before I started using again.  Thankfully you‚Äôre aware of how it‚Äôs affecting you and are taking steps to make sure you stay sober.  One day at a time my friend.  This too shall pass."
12581,2020-12-30 20:13:28,kn3hs6,"Dude.  So much of your story sounds like mine.  I'm afraid I've lost the love of my life too, and I am so sorry.

Couple follow up questions, if you don't mind:

1)  it's not clear from the way you wrote it-are the kids yours biologically or do you have custody?  What happened to them?  

2) Have you talked to your ex-wife about this?  Just wondered if you'd shared the insights about what went wrong in your 1st marriage you've had from this with her.  She might appreciate hearing it."
12582,2020-12-30 20:43:40,kn3hs6,"> Does anyone know why these prophets always prophesy from the front seat of a 2011 Toyota Camry?

Only half-joking: They're the family members of the people in this sub, and they know how much we hate this garbage, so they make sure to be elsewhere when they let themselves go and wallow in it."
12583,2020-12-31 01:46:40,kn3hs6,Why specifically point out that Sara is spelled with no h when it‚Äôs a fake name?
12584,2020-12-31 04:23:43,kn3hs6,"Very sorry you've been through all this.

What you said about Q being an addiction rings true to me. My siblings are both Q-pilled. One is an alcoholic and recovering? meth addict. That sibling is deeply into Q. Has lost custody of the kid, uses Q as a means to soothe a lot of deep pain.

Parents aren't directly Q, but believe there is a deep state keeping Trump from a 2nd term. They're both alcoholics, too."
12585,2020-12-30 16:55:07,kn3hs6,"I am so sorry for your loss and know how painful it must be. Thank you for this articulate explanation of Q as an addiction. It is a cult, an addiction and often a sign of mental illness. It feeds the worst of us."
12586,2020-12-30 16:55:55,kn3hs6,"Thanks for that post, brother. It helps explain the mind set. Congrats on your sobriety."
12587,2020-12-30 16:57:47,kn3hs6,"So so so so so sorry that you had to go through this! And so sorry that we've lost a young bright intelligent mind to a mental virus!

Where is the vaccine that can inoculate us from crazy?"

Asking for a friend üòÅ"
12589,2020-12-30 17:26:23,kn3hs6,"Strength to you, my man. I don't have anything to say other than I read all your story and there's nothing you can do from your side except take care of yourself."
12590,2020-12-30 17:38:39,kn3hs6,"I‚Äôm so sorry, my friend. üíúüñ§üíôüíöüíõ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
12591,2020-12-30 17:42:43,kn3hs6,"Self care is HUGE when going through this. I commend you for putting yourself and mental well-being over trying to change someone that has no desire to change. As the adult child of an alcoholic, at some point you just have to let go. It's hard to love someone when they won't let  you."
12592,2020-12-30 17:44:05,kn3hs6,"Welcome and I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through that.  Two things. 
 
First - as the adult child of an alcoholic, thank you for not going down that road again!  Your kids need you now more than ever and drinking will only push them towards your wife and that world. Yes even that young, kids see and absorb more than adults realize. I still struggle with what I saw and experienced as a kid. 

Second. Just because someone is ‚Äúsmart‚Äù, it doesn‚Äôt mean they won‚Äôt fall victim to this stuff. My brother is extremely smart and did very well for himself (retired in his 40s).. But he fell victim. I think these people are open to it due to underlying personality and psychological traits. They all believe they are smarter, know more, and are some how more righteous than everyone else. Not outright narcissism but something extremely close to it. Most people can‚Äôt see this until it‚Äôs about something they disagree on.  My brother was that way before Q about anything. Q just fanned those flames."
12593,2020-12-30 17:59:37,kn3hs6,I to have lost people down this rabbit hole. Sorry you are going through it. Keep the kids away from it.
12594,2020-12-30 18:12:54,kn3hs6,I'm so sorry
12595,2020-12-30 18:54:36,kn3hs6,"I‚Äôm so glad that you‚Äôre still active in AA right now while going through this, so that you have a group of people to lean on. I‚Äôm also really proud of you for recognizing that this was dangerous for your sobriety and taking the necessary steps to distance yourself, even though it was painful. I‚Äôm sorry that you are going through this."
12596,2020-12-30 19:10:54,kn3hs6,"Whoa I applaud you and your story. You seriously need to be interviewed or write a small book about your experience. I was hooked on every paragraph.

You are so strong emotionally and mentally to go through all of that and not slip back into drinking. That shows in the end you are the stronger party (and you have to be, for the four adorable children üíó ). 

You are right, Q is a sickness and it only takes the person to wake up and acknowledge it themselves.  I hope one day Sara does wake up, if she has the brain for a phd imagine all the amazing things she could do with that title! But, I understand, with the Q mindset they think everything is dangerous and a poison or that its all corrupt. 

I am dealing with this with my husband who really is a ghost of whom I once knew. Even his adult children have noticed hes not the same. You can try to show them the light and they shun from it. I hope one day both of our significant others can see the light even if it involves a rude wake up call of just vanishing and leaving them alone in their thoughts, because that is what they have already done to us."
12597,2020-12-30 19:21:23,kn3hs6,I like how you specify how to spell a fictional persons name
12598,2020-12-30 19:22:16,kn3hs6,‚ÄúSara (with no h)‚Äù...why does that matter if it‚Äôs not her real name? Lol
12599,2020-12-30 19:24:39,kn3hs6,"I am so sorry for what you have lost, and more than a little in awe of how you have held it together and kept your sanity, self care, and sobriety intact."
12600,2020-12-30 19:25:32,kn3hs6,"I learned a lot about conspiracy theories and cults in my psych class that I‚Äôm taking for my psychology major. 

Now I‚Äôm still a freshman, so I don‚Äôt know everything of course, but I‚Äôm very passionate about these topics and getting to the bottom of why and how people spiral down the rabbit hole the way that they do. And you‚Äôre absolutely right, and you put it beautifully. You saw yourself in her. By no means is how far deep she is necessarily her fault, as she is sick, but I hope that she does one day wake up and realize what it has cost her. I cannot imagine the pain and hurt you must be experiencing, not only from witnessing her fall down that path, but for being reminded of your own trauma and experience and pain.

But I‚Äôm proud of you for doing what you did. That is a sign of true strength and healing, so props to you. I hope that one day, she either heals and you two can repair the damage or else you find someone who‚Äôs better suited for you. And if it‚Äôs not to workout, at least she was a reminder for how far you‚Äôve come and how much you‚Äôve healed since your downfall."
12601,2020-12-30 19:26:06,kn3hs6,"Oh, man...my heart is broken for you, but take comfort in the knowledge that it was your only option. I had a mom/childhood like what sounds like hers and wish my parents had been as responsible as you have been. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this, but you are going to get through it. Hope this coming year is better for all of us. ‚ô•Ô∏è"
12602,2020-12-30 19:26:59,kn3hs6,"I am also ten years sober and you nailed it, Qanon is filling a void, it's an escape from reality in the same way any other addiction, be it alcohol, drugs or gambling.  Very sorry to hear about your situation and as a side note appreciate the David Foster Wallace quote, I have read all of his books."
12603,2020-12-30 19:43:48,kn3hs6,THIS A DAMN FUCKING BOOK MAN HOLY SHIT
12604,2020-12-30 19:54:24,kn3hs6,Where can I find this lizard book?
12605,2020-12-30 19:56:17,kn3hs6,"Thanks for sharing this, truly. I don't even know what to say except that I sympathize with your situation and you should be proud because you seem to be handling it exceptionally well. Hang in there man. Good luck"
12606,2020-12-30 20:15:20,kn3hs6,"That‚Äôs not going to end well from the way it sounds to me. Try to end it quick and dirty. 

I know I am not supposed to say this but for me the best way to get over a relationship is to jump into the next one. I once was dumped by the love of my life. Was suffering for a month or so - until I went on Tinder and even though the dates were pretty mediocre I forgot about my heartache. 

Maybe it works for others too. 

Good luck"
12607,2020-12-30 20:23:35,kn3hs6,Powerful story. Thank you for sharing.
12608,2020-12-30 21:46:20,kn3hs6,If Sarah isn't a real name then why does is matter if there's an h or not??
12609,2020-12-30 22:21:41,kn3hs6,"My long time best friend was sucked into this madness by her husband. By the end, she couldn't understand why I was upset with my Orthodox Jewish friend could be a Trump supporter.

She called me illiterate, told me I needed to work on my reading comprehension.

It's been months since she and I spoke, and I often wonder how she wrangles her Religion while supporting a Nazi sympathizer.

The addiction that is Qanon is so real and becomes an obsession for those who struggle with needing to feel self important."
12610,2020-12-30 22:25:12,kn3hs6,"That‚Äôs an  absolutely tragic story OP and so eloquently written. Qanon is like a mind control program that gets into the psyche of those that have had some trauma in their lives and seems to latch onto a narrative that satisfies the emptiness. It‚Äôs designed to divide and conquer, people lose the ability to have critical thinking, and there is no acceptance of differing opinions. Remember a time when people could just have healthy debates, and just agree to disagree. Everyone is so vehemently divisive now and combative - it seems to have all started with Trump."
12611,2020-12-30 22:44:50,kn3hs6,"Courage, brother. You may also want to hit up some Al Anon meetings on Zoom as well, as you are being impacted by someone else‚Äôs addiction.  Take what you like and leave the rest."
12612,2020-12-30 23:01:27,kn3hs6,">the Rothschilds, the Pope, democrats etc.

Has anyone else noticed that the rambling, crazy talk from the family in 'So I Married An Axe Murderer' is actually being repeated as 'real' by Q people?

12613,2020-12-30 23:04:32,kn3hs6,You‚Äôre resilient. I don‚Äôt know much about you but I know that.
12614,2020-12-30 23:21:10,kn3hs6,hang in there
12615,2020-12-30 23:35:21,kn3hs6,I admire your strength to get through that without falling back into a bottle. You seem like a good man Zak and I wish the best for you.
12616,2020-12-30 23:36:10,kn3hs6,Holy shit. Why doesn't logic work with these people?
12617,2020-12-30 23:40:06,kn3hs6,"Congratulations on your sobriety.   I have been a friend of Bill's for over 19 years.   And yes, I totally recognize all the signs of a hopeless addiction among the Q people.   They are not only ruining their own lives by going into this alternate Universe but more importantly are ruining the lives of all the family and friends around them.   That was where we were when we were drinking and drugging.   No more.   And my recommendation often here, is the same one we learned the hard way.....to help an addict/alcoholic you need to let them go and quit enabling them.   Tough love is the only love.  They need to be expelled from the house so they don't harm the normal people in the friends and family circle.   Hopefully they will realize when they hit bottom and then go get some help from somebody or some group that can move their lives back on a positive path.   So sorry this is effecting you, but the World moves in mysterious ways and I imagine you may gain a stronger relationship with your Ex out of this chapter of your life."

12619,2020-12-31 00:17:41,kn3hs6,"Thank you for reiterating the fact that intelligence has very little to do with this (also want to echo other comments that her military history, if anything, probably primed her for this). If anything, the smarter someone is, the more creatively they can convince themselves they're right. The loophole thing also...ugh. Alex Jones is also all about cosmic contracts and shit. The idea that someone can spout what he says in one sentence, and then, in the next one, say it can all be solved by proper observation and enforcement of intergalactic contract law...it's mind numbing. I am so sorry this happened and for how it is affecting you and your family. Thank you for putting your sobriety and your children first. This is all so overwhelmingly awful; I can only hope that the more posts like this people share, the more material people attempting to deradicalize themselves and their loved ones will have. Rooting for you and again, thanks for sharing"
12620,2020-12-31 00:35:12,kn3hs6,"Speechless and just in awe. All the best for next year, pal! <3"
12621,2020-12-31 00:48:08,kn3hs6,"Hi, you mentioned that this is an addiction that is caused by emptiness or a void. If you don't mind me asking, what was your emptiness or void that caused you to dive into alcohol? What do you think her emptiness is?"
12622,2020-12-31 01:27:28,kn3hs6,"Wow. Brother Zak I could have wrote so much of this myself. I am less active in here as of late (you can read my story in an older post). Been trying to move on but this struck a chord with me. Sending you a big hug

Hope you get your ring money back and maybe take yourself on a well deserved vacation!

I was hopeful my girl was intelligent enough to reason out of it eventually but as you are learning this illness resists logic. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt think you will get her back, it‚Äôs a strange ‚Äúdeath‚Äù of who she once was but I fear a death nonetheless"
12623,2020-12-31 01:52:03,kn3hs6,"Your girlfriend is an Adult Child of an Alcoholic. She has a relationship with her Alcoholic mother and shares her mom's QAnon addiction.

That's a helluva combination :(

It's worth comparing and contrasting QAnon with the 12 Traditions QAnon is the worst kind of dry drunk there is, more like a dry equivalent of crack cocaine.

For starters QAnon.puts personalities before principles. 

Compare Q with the AA slogans and tools and its the opposite of  Easy Does It This Too Shall Pass One Day At a Time and Keep It Simple

Compare Q with AAs rigorous honesty and Q flunks out at F minus because they keep moving the goalposts and changing the deadlines."
12624,2020-12-31 01:55:54,kn3hs6,"Hang in there! Also, it‚Äôs really great that you are not drinking. My mother and my best friend are alcoholics and I have seen first hand how one trigger can lead to one drink, which leads to several more and a month of craziness. 

Regarding Sara, maybe telling her all of this, telling her that she has an addiction to the Q game, it really is a game as much as it is a conspiracy cult. And it‚Äôs that ‚Äúfind out more‚Äù ‚Äúhunting for clues‚Äù aspect of it that can be addicting for people. 

Also, I found a podcast from the New York Times (that  she will likely dismiss as fake news) that is very interesting. It‚Äôs called Down the Rabbit hole and features stories from recovered Q people. 

One lady who I listened to (earlier today actually) said that her aha! moment happened when one of the Q YouTube videos she watched claimed to be interviewing military intelligence, and the so called military intelligence official who was supposed to be calling in from a secure channel or something started a prayer session. She said, since her dad was Ex military she knew there is no way that was real, that no one claiming to be that high up in the military would compromise a secure channel to start praying. So, that‚Äôs what made her see the truth. Talk about an awakening! ;) 

Since Sara is really intelligent, maybe if you show her that the lizard people story isn‚Äôt really new. That it‚Äôs the same basic premise as ‚ÄúThe  Protocols of the Elders of Zion‚Äù which was Russian propaganda. Ultimately this book became one of the cornerstones of Nazism and Nazi propaganda and the theme is eerily similar to Q messaging. 

Anyway, best of luck to both of you."
12625,2020-12-31 03:03:51,kn3hs6,I'm sorry to hear this. It may be cold comfort but your prose is impeccable.
12626,2020-12-31 03:08:25,kn3hs6,"You are deserving of love and will find that love one day that will make you feel as complete as you felt in this relationship before the craziness took control. I can imagine how it hurts to watch the people you care about fall into an oblivion that you can‚Äôt pull them out of (I‚Äôve had alcoholics in my family). The shell of them is still there. If anything comes form this, I am glad you were able to take some time to do some introspection to see how there are parallels between Q and alcoholism. The same thing you find in a community in a bar is the same sense of belonging you can find in Q. It takes real strength to do what you have done and to be through what you have. I hope the best for you, your kids and also for Sarah. I hope she finds her peace in life but you‚Äôre right to say it won‚Äôt come until she‚Äôs ready to face it all."
12627,2020-12-31 03:11:47,kn3hs6,"Sorry about you having to go through this shit. Happy for you to have been able to get out of a shitstorm that would have otherwise ruined the rest of your life.

12635,2020-12-31 06:47:40,kn3hs6,"Wow this is rough. I sympathize. 

I'm having a similar problem with my Dad right now. He thinks there's a satanic cabal that is torturing children to create an anti-aging drug. That Trump, although a highly imperfect person, was the ""right man for the job"" and appointed by God. That Trump has taken control of the Federal Reserve and is waging war on the cabal. That somehow Biden and Kamala will end up in jail, the Democrats will all get exposed, and Trump will overturn the election. That coronavirus deaths/infected numbers are being manipulated, masks are a ploy to incite anxiety and sell the vaccine (and they don't actually work at all), Bill Gates is evil, etc.

He keeps sending me ""evidence"" from these random people on Facebook or Fox news. I'll back up my side of the story with .gov sources and such, but of course you can't trust the government. 

My Dad has a dual degree in physics and applied mathematics, working as a computer architect. He's very good at programming, and has taken an IQ test that certifies he has above genius IQ. 

...And yet, he believes this bull crap. For now, I'm keeping my distance until February, which is where the last of his ""predictions"" will run out. 

We have a bet where, If Biden isn't arrested/Trump isn't president, he's gotta apologize to me. I can't wait. Of course, If Trump becomes president, I gotta apologize."

I've had my suspicions that it was more an addiction than anything, but I haven't dealt with addiction enough to definitively draw that conclusion, I appreciate your perspective & I'm sure everyone else here does as well. 
      
We're all standing behind you, I know it's not much, but hopefully you can look upon all the words of encouragement here when it gets tough & draw strength."

12639,2020-12-31 10:53:57,kn3hs6,I have a friend who is into QAnon and genuinely believes Trump is the savior. She also drones about moving to another dimension of consciousness and whatnot. I don't know how the two are related but they seem to be.

She is a graduate of one of the United States Military Academies, served honorably in intelligence for ten years, and after leaving the military due to physical disabilities that developed int he service, she completed a bachelor's degree in laboratory science from a top university with a nearly 4.0 GPA. One of the reasons I fell for her was that I could use words like misanthrope, specious, and quotidian without having to tell her what they meant. We could discuss quantum physics and theories of time and space, then watch an episode of Rick and Morty and laugh our asses off. 

What I reminded me of was how there was a hypothesis about why creationism defenders were, with uncanny frequency, guys with engineering degrees. It's referred to as the [Salem Hypothesis](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Salem_Hypothesis). Whether it's correct or not isn't the point. But both your experience and theirs point to how easily intelligent people can become deluded. It's something I've been thinking a lot about lately given some of the insanity around us."

At least you found out soon enough to call it off. The lizard people thing is just too crazy for me to even understand how someone could be sucked in by that.

Just dump her and don't look back.

Lizard people? No."
12644,2020-12-31 13:12:58,kn3hs6,"I'm so sorry you and your family are experiencing this. Also, congratulations on your sobriety.

Out of curiosity, have you sat her down and talked to her about the lizard people stuff specifically? I would think that would be the easiest to get someone to think critically about. Unless she's just wildly anti-Semitic, the history and context of that particular conspiracy theory - plus the scientific improbability of lizard people as a concept - should point to the fact that it's untrue. They usually use exactly the same language/ideas as age-old anti-Semitic canards (drinking Christian blood, sacrificing Christian children, worshiping the devil, etc) and target mostly Jewish people, like the Rothschilds. It's been described as a modern way to be somewhat covertly anti-Semitic, but anti-Semites all know what it means. I might be biased when it comes to this one though because it is my personal most hated conspiracy theory. Regardless, best to you and your family."

My dear friend, I am deeply moved by your story, and especially your insight in paragraph 14 where you conclude that Qanon is an addiction. Bam!

While reading it, some pieces of cult behavior and Qanon tumbled into place.  As I reread my intro to AlAnon above, I realized that I unwitting described Qanon. That in itself is evidenced we all have blind spots that insights such as yours can reveal. Thank you.

They lit up with life, love and compassion. NowI look at his baby blues and they look like a dark cloud is covering them. He sees this as the light and a mission of good vs. evil. Perhaps he‚Äôs right in a backwards way because whatever/whoever he‚Äôs listening to seems to have stolen his wonderful soul.

As hard as it must have been, your children need and deserve a good models and as much stability and happiness as possible. It surely doesn‚Äôt sound like something Sara can provide. And you know you need to be careful about falling into a relapse.

She gave up a wonderful life and beautiful children. The power of this cult is unbelievable. How anyone could give up a wonderful future filled with family, love, and adventure is beyond comprehension.

Your pain is all too evident in your post. Thanks for sharing.

There are several here who are friends of Bill W. As you already know from that, you are not alone. You have a clear assessment of 'Sara'. 

You could try talking to her, alone one on one. No TY, FB or Twitter. No TV or videos or books. Just the two of you. Be calm. Be polite. Ask her questions and insist she answer them in her own words. If either of you become angry, change the subject. Keep the conversation going. Don't yell or raise your voice. she may come around given enough time and patience. The patience needed to keep this going will be a lot. It is worth a shot.

Something just popped in their head. 

&#x200B;

I do not understand it. A very good friend of mine has been consumed by this via his girlfriend. I do not understand it at all."
12680,2020-12-30 16:25:15,kn3hs6,"Call it the crusty old NCO in me, but as for Military Academy slots and Intelligence jobs, yes, the military does hand them out pretty liberally. I can name at least 3 Qs and there's a few people I'd call ""on the fence"" that were either Intelligence soldiers or officers. If anything, it seems like people in the military are more predisposed to Q and proto-Qism. 

&#x200B;

What follows is merely my theory but: You spend most of your adult life in foreign countries fighting people for reasons that even the people sending you to fight can't give clear reasons for, leaving behind a trail of bad decisions, shattered and broken families, and stress, and then you come home to a world that doesn't seem to understand you. ""Thank you for your service"" rings a bit hollow after a bit, and all of that ignores the mental health problems associated with the military.

&#x200B;

So when someone hands you a youtube video explaining how the politicians that sent you over were too busy trafficking young girls and being super corrupt to care about you, and you shrug it off *at first*. Then you start to compare it to the politicians in the countries you've been deployed to, (Where things like human trafficking are common and corruption is endemic). Then the Epstein thing comes out, and all you hear are accusations that the high level democrats are tied up in his sex trafficking scheme, and it seems to validate the whole thing.

&#x200B;

Now, someone thinking critically would go: well, Epstein was really close with Trump, and there's that whole Times article where Trump alludes to the fact that Epstein was interested in very young women, and conclude that he's probably tied up in it too, but if the person voted for Trump in the first go-around, they probably have a certain sunk-cost fallacy which incentivizes them to turn a blind eye. And if they didn't, there's still this hold-over from our youth where the President couldn't possibly be a bad person, could they? And of course, you'll never see a picture of Trump and Epstein together on Fox news. So they create their own little bubble, excluding inconvenient facts from it to protect this nascent view of the world. 

&#x200B;

Soon enough they start looking for more material and they find no shortage of people that will reinforce that worldview on youtube. People that often have the classic ""military retiree chic"" beards, ballcaps and sunglasses. Guys that look like the people the newly minted Q-victim might have a beer with. Down-to-earth people sitting in their cars, expressing their same frustrations with how complicated life is now that there aren't objective names on the map. And these people have youtube channels with names that they can relate to, and once the algorithm kicks in, they just get offered more and more, and it leads further and further down into the rabbit hole.

12681,2020-12-30 17:23:27,kn3hs6,"It's one of those things where if you worked in catering or had experience booking catering for fancy large events with big budgets, you'd get it, but if you don't have experience of how things work in detail, you can easily get sucked into believing crazy things on the basis of small amounts of information. I think a lot of conspiracy theories take advantage of people not understanding/having experience of the way a lot of things actually work, for example like science and scientific research is a big one people seem to not understand so project all kinds of crazy onto it that scientists can see would be completely impossible and unworkable."

Oh, I'm sure that $65K is lowballing it for even a casual White House party.

But I know that email that they are talking about, and it was not between Obama, Hilary, and Podesta. It was an email chain planning an in-office party for a Texas-based global intelligence firm, Stratfor, and they discussed food, one of the participants ‚ÄúI think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long ago, assume we are using the same channels?‚Äù

And that's where the idea that Obama spent 65K, which again, is probably a bargain for a White House part, on hot dogs and pizza, came from. This dude in Texas.

Although I will point out that Obama threw a few Super Bowl parties in the White House that had pizza and hot dogs on the menu."

I was sitting here reading OPs post and feeling a lot of empathy because my mom got sucked into a religious conspiracy when I was growing up so I know what it's like to have a person you love and care about believing things that aren't connected to reality in any way... but then I also felt smug about my own ability to reason and thought maybe I'll seek out some of those videos because I'm  absolutely convinced that I would never, ever fall for anything Q so I just want to challenge they assumption and prove I can out-think the smart people that fall for this stuff.

Then I remembered that last spring when the NYT came out with those UFO videos I watched Tom DeLonge on JRE and fell for the alien story. I then felt like an idiot and decided I need to stop judging people for their addiction."

We have problems wrapping our heads around the seemingly paradoxical fact that rare events are collectively quite common. So we tend to attribute meaning to coincidental events. Superstition is hard-wired in our DNA; some of us are better at fighting it and others roll with it. We're not born with critical thinking skills, they need to be learned.

Qanon capitalizes on our pattern-seeking behavior by urging believers to ""do their own research"". I liken it to an internet-wide game of [connect-the-dots](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EY9p2yZXgAQ19bV.jpg) where you're *guaranteed* to find the pattern you're looking for... especially when you're told where to look. It's an even bigger problem when you consider that there's only one reality competing against an infinite number of falsehoods, and most people lack the discernment capabilities to tell the difference.

That said, Qanon takes irrationality and gullibility to another level. There has to be something seriously wrong -- emotionally, psychologically, or intellectually -- to buy into this nonsense."

12827,2020-12-30 15:22:51,kn3gg9,"Because every trump supporter voted for trump, while every democrat or non politically affiliated person voted for different people."
12828,2020-12-30 15:32:29,kn3gg9,"She‚Äôs extremely unaccomplished for a First Lady.

She‚Äôs at least bilingual, but there‚Äôs [no evidence](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/melania-trump-multiple-languages/) to suggest she speaks anything more than that, except that she said so in one interview (and some evidence to suggest she doesn‚Äôt). And that‚Äôs dubious, given that she‚Äôs publicly lied about things like [graduating college](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/09/who-is-melania-trump) (she dropped out after a semester).

Moreover, she hasn‚Äôt really done anything with the First Lady role the way many previous FLOTUSes have. Other than blind devotion to the Trump brand, there‚Äôs no reason to hold Melania in higher esteem than other women who are public figures."
12829,2020-12-30 15:27:21,kn3gg9,"> she is a very accomplished woman

You're using the word ""accomplished"" very loosely. She was a b list model that married a wealthy businessman."
12830,2020-12-30 16:02:26,kn3gg9,"> She's a former model

Wow such an admirable career!

> immigrant

Got here via prostitution

> speaks like 6 languages.

This was proven to be false.  She could barely say hello in some of those 6 languages

>  she is a very accomplished woman.

Being a trophy wife is not an accomplishment

> If she was FLOTUS to any other president she would be much more popular.

She would never be FLOTUS to another President because no other President is going to marry an escort."
12831,2020-12-30 16:07:53,kn3gg9,"I actually think she'd be less popular if she was FLOTUS for someone else. She's had her own list of controversies while FLOTUS and very few actions, but her husband overshadows her so nothing really sticks. Cribbed Michelle Obama's DNC speech as her own, travels using the air force fleet a lot, wore a ""I don't care"" jacket to visit a camp where Mexican children were being held, complained about Christmas, etc. If Obama was on tape saying she didn't give a shit about Christmas but had to do it anyways, that would've been a lot bigger.

Positives are her anti-bullying campaign."
12832,2020-12-30 15:24:24,kn3gg9,She‚Äôs a cardboard cutout with nothing to say.

How does one feel anything but disgust, let alone admiration, at such a figure? A guy who hunted down Snowden (of which Biden was a big figure). Covered up the torture program, etc. etc. 

I don't wanna get into an argument, just wanna say your country and my country will never get any better until we realize Barack Obama is a bad person."

12843,2020-12-30 17:50:13,kn3gg9,"Exactly, it‚Äôs like criticizing capitalism while using a phone built with slave labor."

12846,2020-12-30 15:38:22,kn3gg9,"I mean... What exactly did Michelle Obama accomplish that made her so admired? Be married to Barack?

It's the same with Melania. She's married to (according to this poll) a popular person, and she puts on a high class persona (regardless of the authenticity).

If that gets Michelle Obama number 1 idk why people would be shocked Melania is up there too

Edit: the people voting in these polls aren't digging through Melania trump's college records to see if she actually graduated college.."
12847,2020-12-30 15:42:14,kn3gg9,"Eh she's accomplished. There's only been 45 first lady's and she's one of em.

I get what you're saying but I'm trying to talk through the lens of the average population voting in this poll... Average people don't obsess over the first lady. All they know is she's attractive, rich/glamorous, and the president's wife.  If they love the president they're probably going to love her"
12848,2020-12-30 15:35:14,kn3gg9,I will never understand why  Melenia gets so much disrespect. She seems like a good person now
12849,2020-12-30 15:13:28,kn3gg9,"Facts... It's so fucked up, but it's not like we the people care enough to do anything about it."
12850,2020-12-30 15:14:39,kn3gg9,"How am I excusing anything?
I'm saying that being a war criminal is a part of the job of being president of the us... they kill innocent people. It's not a new phenomena"
12851,2020-12-30 15:25:22,kn3gg9,"> lmao did she come in the kitchen and pour a bunch of salt in the food?

She kinda did the opposite, removed all the good stuff. 

it also wasnt ‚Äúmuh capitalism‚Äù that forced government institutions to run poorly, just ham fisted policy.

Try not to take the internet so seriously, sometimes people are just making jokes, no need to get butt hurt about it."
12852,2020-12-30 15:33:49,kn3gg9,No dude it was all her fault. I went to school in a very good district but those lunches were so ass. She ruined lunches. When the Obamas left office the lunches got better

12854,2020-12-30 15:42:17,kn3gg9,Of course.
12855,2020-12-30 15:48:33,kn3gg9,"I mean, Michelle actually had her own extremely successful career before Barack‚Äôs took off. Her success was basically what allowed Barack to take the low-paying community organizing jobs that got him into politics.

She‚Äôs also a multi-time Ivy League grad, led a number of very visible public policy initiatives as FLOTUS, and remains a successful author and public commentator since leaving the White House. She‚Äôs pretty much the gold standard for First Ladies.

Melania doesn‚Äôt do anything. I‚Äôm not confident I could even tell you what her voice sounds like."
12856,2020-12-30 16:03:28,kn3gg9,Being an escort turned trophy wife to a conman that duped and then fucked America is not an accomplishment.
12857,2020-12-30 15:49:14,kn3gg9,"Good people don‚Äôt nominally run an anti-bullying initiative while doing nothing to stop their husbands from bullying others. They also don‚Äôt wear jackets that say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care, do you?‚Äù To a border camp housing immigrant children removed from their parents by that husband‚Äôs government."
12858,2020-12-30 15:16:23,kn3gg9,Ok... agreed then. Doesn't have to be though.

12865,2020-12-30 15:09:19,kn3g4t,"There would be honestly no point. Politician's family members are rarely public figures themselves.

So it would be like ""Otto Normal, the son of [insert name], who is the [insert political position] of [insert state], was recently stopped driving under the influence (or whatever)"". And people would wonder what the fuck that has to do with the politician, or their position, or the state. 

Family members are just people. People fuck up. Nothing their family members can do about it or be hold responsible for."
12866,2020-12-30 15:24:55,kn3g4t,"The reason that happens in the US is most important politicians are part of a dynasty where many family members are politically active or somehow else in the spotlight. Somewhat like competing royals or the Kardashians, ironically if you think about it. In comparison to that probably a very small percentage of the population even have an idea how to husband of Merkel looks like."
12867,2020-12-30 15:06:33,kn3g4t,"Rarely, but only under special condition. I have two examples of politicians with problematic family members, Sigmar Gabriel and Beatrix von Storch. Both have family members who were relevant in the Nazi-time.

With Gabriel, nobody holds that against him. He has distanced himself from his family's past and openly (verbally) attacked far right idiots that brought it up. It is clear than he denounces his past, and because of that, nobody cares about it.

Other is Beatrix von Storch, who is a leader in the far right party of the AfD, and you don't need to see more than a few of her twitter messages to see her deep idiological connection to her Grandfather. With her, it is regularly brought up that her grandfather was a leader of the Nazi party.

So, basically, the only time where it is generally accepted by the public to bring the family of a politician in a discussion is when the person themselves, with their own action, assosiate themselves with it. There are to many Nazis skelletons in German family's closets to really care much about family history unless people show tendencies to follow in their footsteps."
12868,2020-12-30 14:46:55,kn3g4t,"No.

At least I can't think of any case."
12869,2020-12-30 15:53:16,kn3g4t,Our campaigns are not as vile and dehumanizing as they are in the US.
12870,2020-12-30 15:42:34,kn3g4t,"I think several of our German politicians are quite splendid in fucking up for themselves, they don't need their families to dig up some dirt.

Like Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg (CDU, center right) had to resign because he cheated in his dissertation (he is not the only one cheating).

The young shooting star of CDU (center right), Philipp Amthor, retreated because he practiced dirty lobbyism and was caught red-handed for receiving ridiculously expensive presents and payment after arranging a few meetings (yay to free journalism!).

Gerhard Schr√∂der (SPD, center left) sold himself to Gazprom after his political career.

There are several more culprits in politics (dubious donations are quite as popular as cheating on the dissertation), so no need to pry in family history."
12871,2020-12-31 08:46:11,kn3g4t,"Definitely not like this. I think most politicians are judged by the their behaviour and their opinions rather than their family. I don‚Äòt even know if Merkel has siblings and I surely don‚Äòt know about the other less ""famous"" politicians.

Though I think it would be talked about if, I dunno, the brother of Micheal Wendler became a politician. I could see how his family ties could affect him there."
12872,2021-01-03 07:09:43,kn3g4t,"I don't think it should have anything to do with family. Because it's you who are in politics, not your family."
12873,2020-12-30 19:10:25,kn3g4t,"German press goes above and beyond to find out more about Merkel's private life. For example, we know such stunning revelations like her husband doing their laundry or her favourite potato soup recipe. Truly news to keep up with."
12874,2020-12-30 16:00:02,kn3g4t,Does Joe Laschet not count?
12875,2020-12-30 19:52:43,kn3g4t,"I think the one time I remember it making news was when the daughter of former Bundespr√§sident Scheel came out as lesbian and got together with Hella von Sinnen. 

That was the late 80s when attitudes on being gay were different. 

Andrea Merkels daughter was mentioned in the late 90s scandal when Merkel and other MdBs used the Flugbereitschaft of the Bundeswehr as their private taxi. The daughter was in school abroad and the flights by Merkel to that destination got flagged as fraud."
12876,2020-12-30 22:33:13,kn3g4t,I think we had an issue with President Wulf and the rumors his wife was an escort in her past.

12879,2020-12-30 20:30:31,kn3g4t,"The media are constantly trying to introduce US-style campaigning here with shit like ""TV duels"". Merkel vs Schulz was a pure personality contest."
12880,2020-12-31 09:31:21,kn3g4t,"The real question is, do you have the potato soup recipe?"
12881,2020-12-30 16:14:27,kn3g4t,Not really because Armin Laschet was involved in it.
12882,2020-12-30 21:14:29,kn3g4t,Angela Merkel doesn't have kids.
12883,2021-01-01 05:52:00,kn3g4t,"What ou mean with ""we""? Escort is just a job where you pay taxes and so on."

Muttis Lieblingsrezept!"
12885,2020-12-30 21:22:12,kn3g4t,"Stepdaughter? Or something like this. She was definitely doing private trips on government money and with government means (Flugbereitschaft) that were supposed to be ""government business only"" by law.

A comedy show did a song about it, a cover of ""√úber den Wolken""."
12886,2021-01-01 07:49:45,kn3g4t,"""We"" as a scandal in German politics."

I grew up sheltered in a bland suburb. At the mall, I saw parts of ‚ÄúThe Blues Brothers‚Äù movie when it first came out on VHS, which was right around the time I started trombone in band. The musical sequences were unlike anything I‚Äôve seen and heard - the energy, color, and that beat! It was the antithesis to everything post-disco that was around me. That led me to search out blues (and living near Chicago made that process a little easier), then jazz, and then on to racial and political issues that I never would‚Äôve been exposed to otherwise. Around that same time, I was a junior cinephile, as I used to read and watch Ebert & Siskel, and go to the library to read Pauline Kael. A film they all loved, ‚ÄúDeathtrap‚Äù just came out, and I was a loner kid that used to go to the movies alone (still do, sometimes). My dad wouldn‚Äôt let me go because Christopher Reeve played a gay writer, and mixed in with the typical 80s gay panic, the plan was shot down immediately. I‚Äôm still not sure exactly why I took it so hard, but I did, and I made a vow that I wouldn‚Äôt need my parents‚Äô permission on seeing or hearing anything I wanted ever again. That gave me every chance to rent whatever I wanted at the video store (pre-corporate consolidation, remember - in those days video stores would carry ANYTHING), whatever looked the weirdest, as long as I kept it hidden, because I was living in fear from the rest of my family.

I do not understand discriminating against people for their sexuality, their race, their religion, or whatever else. I want things to be as fair as possible, and I want the world to be kinder. I would like policy to be based on science and logic rather than the self-interests of politicians.

America's two big parties should be broken up as the duopoly they are, and replaced with eight or ten parties, requiring cooperation and alliances to get anything done.

It‚Äôs un-American to continue this downward spiral, democrats need to do something! Stop spending money, the deficit is out of control!! We support our veterans! We added $40B to the military! Not a single Soldier will get a raise. We need to cut all programs to reduce spending! The deficit!! Jobs!! SOCIALISM!!

Soon now, deaths due to the pandemic will eclipse job losses and everything will be fixed!

The Republican mentality in a nutshell.  Just kill enough (other, preferably poor and minority) people until everything is fixed!"
13022,2020-12-30 13:41:32,kn22lk,Biden is for sure gonna be a one-term president. Get ready for Trump 2.0 Electric Chair Boogaloo
13023,2020-12-30 19:43:51,kn22lk,"How was Covid-19 Trump‚Äôs fault? 

The response was trash by him and his administration, but every nation is in some sort of lockdown and suffering the economic impact. The new Covid strain is also an issue that is irrespective of Trump, and any potential impact it has going forward?

I feel if anything Biden will implement a more conservative reopening plan, though coupled with an aggressive vaccination rollout . . . I don‚Äôt think you can place the stagnant job recovery on Trump; everything would be constrained even with a competent Covid response."

This, of course, means a 4-day work week but not necessarily 3-day weekends."
